STORY TOLD BY
A BRITISH SPY
Detective "Jones" Testifies
Against Edward J.
Ivory.
. Joined Camps of the Friends o
Ireland in Order to
' â¢ B.tray Them.
THE PRISONER HELD FOR TRIAL
Great Nervousness Displayed by the
Informer Employed by the
English Government
LONDON, Ekg., Nov. 13.â Edward J.
Ivory, the alleged dynamiter, was com
mitted for trial to-day by the Bow-street
â  police magistrate.
In accordance with the prisoner's pre
vious request for the protection of an
American citizen Mr. Carter, representing
the United States embassy, was present to
watch the proceedings. A witness was
called to the stand wnose name was with
held from the public, but was written on a
piece of paper and handed to the cleric.
The witness, whose name was given as W.
A. Jones, proved to be a Government spy,
who was sent to the United States in 1891
to watch dynamiters. He joined the
United Irishmen in New York and was
initiated into the Shamrock Ciub in the
presence of Tynan, Kearney and other
prominent Irish agitators. Subsequently
.a new Irish camp was formed, of which
the witness was elected treasurer.
The prisoner detailed his connection
â witn the methods of the Irish society in
New York and said :
"I retain a complete set of documents,
covering several years, containing the
names of members and changes in the or-
ganization, including the details of the
. convention names of delegates of the
different camps, etc. One convention was
held in 1692, and the next was held in
Chicago in September, 1895. Kearney's
camp was 152. It has since been dis
banded. Kearney is now vice-president of
camp 81. Tynan's camr> is No. 98 and
Jones' 81. In going to the Chicago con-
vention in 1895 tne members had a special
car from New York to a pace called
'Ferry.' I mci Kearney, who introduced
me to the prisoner, saying he was a
brother."
Jones said tnar part of the money con
tributed to the Natally Club was devoted
to a revolutionary fund, and money was
also called for to pay for celebrations of
the death of the "Manchester martyrs,"
and to assist the convicted dynamiters.
While going to Chicago in 1895, he said,
Tynan, who was with the party, told him
that Ivory was a member of his (Tynan's)
camp, and that he had known him in
Dublin prior to 1882.
Jones then produced the documents he
"had mentioned, including tile ritual of
the Cian-na-Gael, which Prosecutor Gill
related, showing that the object of the
Union Republican Brotherhood was to
achieve the complete independence of Ire-
Jand by revolution.
The witness was extremely nervous. He
shifted about constantly and cast furtive
glances in all directions, fearing that he
. would be sketched. He admitted that he
had acied throughout as a British agent,
ar.d had copied and preserved the docu
ments submitted at the instance of the
â¢British Government. Jones appears to be
about 40 years of age. He was well but
* plainly dresM'd. He has nut-brown hair,
and wears a short cropped beard and mus
tache. He has sharp features, a clear
skin and clear blue eyes, which are rather
â¢sunken. He gave his address as 609 Am
sterdam avenue. New York.
Ivory, or Bell, exhibited the greatest
co:.sternation upon seeing Jones, but
afterward regained his composure.
The name "Jones." Liven as that of the
spy who testified against Ivory, is not his
right name, that having been withheld by
the prosecution. When the witness was
called to the stand Proseeuior Gill said
that the Government, for obvious reasons,
declin- d to disclose the man's name
whereupon the maeistrate, Sir John
Bridge, said, "Call him Jones.' : The wit
ness was sharply cross-examined by coun
sel for the defense, but his direct testi
mony was not materially altered.
When the examination of the witness
was finished Sir John Bririge addresser!
the prisoner, saying: "You are charged
with having conspired unlawfully and
maliciously with Tynan and others to
cause explosions in the Uniied Kingdom,
endangering life and property, and you
are alto charged w:th feloniously aiding
and abetting that crime. Have you any
thing to say?"
Many persons in the courtroom believed
that Ivory would take advantage of tbi*
opportunity to make a sensational state
" nient, but instead of doing so he merely
rep.ied, "No, your Worship."
. Solicitor Cudahy, on behalf of Ivory,
argued that the charge against the prisoner
would fail because his fellow-conspirators
were not jointly charged with him. More
over, he said, there was no evidence of
conspiracy. Ivory was a well-known and
respectable hotel-keeper in New York, and
Tynan, a customer of the hotel, had in
"troduced him to the alleged conspirators
The evidence, he contended, showeu thai
Bell was not connected with the house in
Amsterdam avenue. New York, mentioned
by the witness. "Jones."
Sir John Bridge replied impatiently that
these p int did not arise a the present
time. It wai necessary, he held, that ail
ol tne conspirators should be indictt d if
they ciuld not be found. It was c ear,
how>ver, that Ivory had met Tynan in
Antwerp, and that they were both con
nected with exp os ye cbem cals. The c
, was the strongest evidt-m-e that the
/ prisoner was engaged in a c mspracy, and
â  he would, thereiore, com in t him for trial
\ in the Criminal Court, Ol<i Bai.ey.

The San Francisco Call

No one can be found who will ?ay with
any degree of assurance who the informer
is. There are those, however, who are
willing to believe that they have seen the
man in this city, but many differ as to his
identity. One man well informed in Irish

held a number of city positions, and a few
months ago engaged in a small business
in that city.
He returned to Ireland about ten weeks
ago, it is said, after disposing of his busi

he had inherited a large fortune in North
ern Ireland and that he had tone there to
take possession. Others say that "Jones"
was in Chicago at the lime referred to.
YET CONFIDENT OF VICTORY.
Susan B. Anthony Tells How Suffrage
Was Temporarily Beaten by the
L quor Men.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 13.â Miss
Susan B. Anthony, president of the Na
tional Woman's Suffrage A-sociation, and
head and front of the suffrage movement
everywhere, reached Kansas City this
morning from California, where she has
been waging the suffrage war. Speaking
of the campaign, she said to a United
Associated Presses' correspondent:
"Well, we met defeat, but we made a
magnificent battle. We began our cam
paign last March. We secured the in
dorsements of every political party except
the Democrats, having our cause cham
pioned by churches, educational and in
liustrial institutions, and ten days before
election it was conceded by everybody
that we had won. But we counted with
out our hosts.
"The liquor associations of the State
massed their forces and announced bitter
hostility to the movement. Tney fought
us tooth and nail, and at the polls the
amendment was lost by some 10,000 votes.
The liquor men did it. The new Legisla
ture is bound to resubmit the proposition,
afid in 1898 we are sure of success. The
question will also be submitted to the
voters of Oregon and Nevada in 1898, so
that the fight will be on in three States.
Work ahead for us, you see."
"Have you given up the fight in Kan
sas?"
"Yes; Kansas is a hopeless State. The
Republicans sold us out to the iiquor men
two years ago and are now worse in their
toils than ever before."
Miss Anthony spoke at the suffrage con
vention this afternoon and again this
evening.
FINDS A LONG LOST BROTHER.
James Campbell, the Victim of Winthrop,
to Join His Relation After Forty-
Seven Years.
FORT SCOTT, Kanb., Nov. 14â James
Campbell, the Sandwich Islands mil
lionaire sugar-grower, who was kidnaped
a few months ago at San Francisco and
held for a $50,000 ransom, is expected here
soon to visit his brother, George Campbell.
Tney have not met since they separated in
Londonderry, Ireland, forty-seven years
ago. Each was lost to the other until re
cently, wiien they were reunited by means
of items in the newspapers.
George Campbell is one of the wealthiest
stockmen in the county, and lives on bis
bit: ranch twenty-five miles west of here.
A few days <Â»fter the kidnaping the
ranchman read the details of the affair
and he wrote the Sandwich Islands man.
Three montns passed and no answer came
and the ranchman had about decided to
abandon his iaea of relationship to tru
millionaire, when one day a rougtily
dressed stranger, who professed to be tra
versing the continent on foot, stopped at
his House. Campbell afterward recalled
that the man wore whits cuffs and silk
hose under his apparently travel-stained
clothing. Later it developed that the vis
itor was a detective from San Francisco.
Two weets later Campbell received a letter
from the sugar millionaire, and further
correspondence has resulted in arrange
ments for the brothers to meet at the
ranchman's home here soon.

Weaknesses in the Battle-Ship
Texas That 0 ficers Try

Why the C nrt of Inquiry Is Ho ding
an Investigation Behind
C osfd Doors.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Nov. 13.-It is
staled at the Navy Department in extenu
ation of the !act that the coun of inquiry
on the battle-ship Texas is held behind
closed doors that it is not thought advis
able to give publicity to the possible weak
nesses in the ship just at the present junc
ture, when the eyes of other nations are
directed to our naval and military estab
lishments. It is learned that the investi
gation is developing evidence of a some
what startling natur> about the structural
strength of the ship's hull, wh ; ch has
caused so much concern since her keel
was laid.
The most remarkable thing about the
recent noodm â¢ of the ship was that tne
water-tight doors leaked and o.her com
partments were fl odtd in addition to that
iv v.h.c;i tht, accident occurred. It is now
developed thHton account of lack of stiff
ness in all the bulkheads of the ship and
consequent warping of the frames and
plates, none of the doors when closed
fitted hermetically, as they should, and
the cellular system of the vessel is there
fore practically worthless.

MUCH EXCITEMENT IN HAVANA
Spain Will Now Realize Most Forci
by the Impossibility oi Subduing
the Patriots.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 13.â A Sun
special from Key West says: GennraJ
"Weyler, acting under instructions from
the home Government to proceed to the
front, immediately left for Mariel by sea.
After leaving Mariel he crossed the trocha
and proceeded to Guanajay, where he
placed himself at the bead of the Spanish
forces and marched into the interior with
25,000 men. He took the field as com
mander-in-chief of the combined forces
under General Arolas, Nunoe, Aguila and
Echague.
An attack waÂ« made on the camp of
Maceo, who was strongly fortified in the
hills of Pinar del Rio. General Maceo
had been notified of the coming attack by
his lieutenants, Delgado and Diaz, and
their advance guards. Maceo im medi
ately prepared to give the attacking col
umn a warm reception.
General Ec ague attacked Maceo on tne
right. General M lguizo attacked the
stronghold from the left. General Maceo
had 500 sharpshooters with him, who
singled out the Spanish generals Echapue
and Melguizo and shot them down. Gen
eral Weyler, it is reported, was slightly
wounded in the leg. This battle lasted
several hours and heavy losses are re
ported on both sides. Maceo succeeded
in routing Weyler and his troop 3. The
loss of the two Spanish generals had the
desired effect and they made a hasty re
treat.
The result of this battle has caused
great excitement in Havana and strong
protests nave been forwarded to the home
Government again-t the retention of Gen
eral Weyler as Captain-General of Cuba
by some of the Spanish citizens of the
island.
The report that Maceo had left his
forces and gone to Maximo Gomez is
without foundation. He is still with his
forces in the Pinar del Rio district at hn
Bironghold. Geneial Weyler is expected
home at bis palace momentarily. Run.or
has it that he will at once be recalled by
the home Government.
The foregoing version of the first conÂ»
fl ct between General Weyler'a troops and
Recognized at Last*
the insurgents under Maceo differs ma
terially from General Weyler's official re
port as cabled from Havana, in which he
claimed a victory.
TO MAINTAIN NEUTRALITY
President Cleveland Mot Heady to Inter-
fere With the Sirtfe.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13 âTo a
Senator who called upon him to-day to
inquire in respi-ct to the war rumors in
regard to Cuba, President Cleveland re
plied that the position of this Government
was, as stated in his last annual message
to Congress, one of traditional sympathy
with a people struggling for autonomy
and freedom, b t, nevertheless, this Gov
ernment feit its plain duty to honestly
fulfill every international obligation.
The President further said that every
precaution had been taken so that if occa
sion should arise in Cuba the United
States could assert itself with force; but
he did not think that occasion would
arise. Secretary Lamont was more out
spoken, and expressed his individual
opinion that some authoritative statement
should be made to put an end to the dis
turbing and unjustifi- d rumors of war.
Senur de Lome, Spanish Minister, re
ceived the foiiowing cablegram to-day
from Duke de Tetuan. Spanish Minister of
Foreign Affair*, dated Madrid, yesterday:
"The cablegram â * from New York and
Washington published in London refer
ring to suppo-ed notes of Mr. Taylor and
the Spanish Government are entirely false.
There is not the sli latest foundation for
such rumors, w; ich are undoubtedly of
filibustering origin."

yesterday: A foreign banker, with the
best sources of iniormation, tells us that
all the prominent bankers of Europe nave
decided not to loan Spain any further
money to prosecute the fight in Cuba. He
thinks that the Cuban war will cotne to an
end soon for lack ol funds to pro.-ecute it.
The European markets are more or less
demoralized by the great fall in Spanish
securities, particularly in Paris, wbeie
Spanish credit has been terminated. He
concludes that if Eu:oi>ean bankers will

LONDON, Eye, Nov. 13.â The expres
sion of English, French and Continental
opinion generally is a veritabe chorus of
celebration over the restored concert of
the powers in regard to Turkey, as indi
cated by Lord Salisbury in his speech at
the Lord Mayor's banquet in the Guild
Hall last Monday. The Sultan's ac
ceptance of the large scheme of reforms
submitted to him is alleged to be due to
the concert of tbe powers, which the
French press credits to M. Hanotaux's
masterly seizure of the proper moment to
coerce the Porte.
In the Lo don diplomatic circle all this
talk of the Sultan's acceptance of the re
forms is considered to be extremely fishy,
and tbe whole tenor of the facts derived
from official sources in Constantinople
points to the certainty that the Sultan is
pursuing his old course of deceit.
Before the extraordinary tribunal try
ing the persons arrested for participation
in the Galeta riocs was closed under tbe
pressure exerted by M. Cambqn, the
French Embassador, tbe Sultan's Judges
sentenced to death or to long terms of im
prisonment the whole crowd of Ar
menians brought before them, and liber
ated all of the Mosii ms, and M. Cambon
now asks for the appointment of a Euro
pean commission to report upon the sen
tences imposed by the tribunal.
Tlie Embassadors at Constantinople,
viewing the Sultan's promises of reforms
in the light of a comedy, are leaving Con
stantinople for the purpose of taking a
holiday until the chiefs of their respective
Governments decide what to do next.

FIVE CENTS.
RECEIVER FOR
THE VANDALIA
President Malott of an In
dianapolis Bank in
Charge.
Peculiar Turn in tlr Affairs of
One of the Most Prosperous
Railroads.
FREIZS-CTJT GAME ALLEGED.
The Suit Said to Be for the Sole
Purpose of Sel ing the System at
a Low Figure.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 13.â Judge
Woods of the United States Circuit Court
this evening appointed a receiver for the
Terra Haute and Indianapolis Railway
Company, known as the Vandalia, nam
ing as receiver Volney T. Malott, presi
dent of the Indiana National Bank. The
receiver was appointed upon the suit of
Mark T. Cox, James T. Blair and James
W. Paul Jr., againtt the company, and
the ground for the receivership was the
admission of the company in court that it
is insolvent.
The Vandalia has been known as one of
the most prosperous roads in the country,
and until a year ago, when it passed into
the control of the Pennsylvania company,
which purchased a majority of its stock,
it met its dividends and all charges with
the u'most promptness.
During the hearing to-day Judge Woods
remarked in court upon the peculiar fact
that all three attorneys seemed to desire a
receiver, and he did not make up his
mind to appoint one until this evening.
Some of the parties interested in the
securities of the system who were not
made parties in interest are declaring to
night that the suit is a collusive one for
the purpose of freezing them out and sell
ing tbe system to the Pennsylvania at a
low figure.
The plaintiffs in the snit were repre
sented by John G. Williams, formerly
general manager of the Vandalia system;
George W. Wickersham of ]Sew York,
Samuel Dickerson of Nc.vYork and Mr.
Golden of St. Louis. The defendant com
pany was represented by S. 0. Pickeus,
who is also attorney for the Pennsylvania
company. The bill sets forth that in 1870
the defendant company acquired posses
sion of the St. Louis, Vandalia and Terre
Haute Railroad, and that in 1592 it took
charge of the Terre Haute and Peoria
Railroad, entering into a contract with it
for ninety-nine years.
Prior to this latter consolidation in
1889 the Terre Haute and Peoria had by
deed of trust conveyed all its property to
the Union Trust Company of New York,
to secure first mortgage gold coupon bonds
to the amount of $1,800,000, due March 1,
1927, with interest at 5 per cent. In 1892,
while the negotiations for consolidation
with the Terre Haute and Indianapolis
were pending, the Terre Haute and Peoria
authorized the issue of bonds to tbe
amount of $2,500,000, payable to the Union
Trust Company, for the purpose of im
proving the road and lor retiring the first
issue if bonds. The consolidation was
effected in October, 1892, and the bonds
were issued.
By the terms of the contract entered into
between the defendant com pan v and the
bondholders it was agreed that 30 per cent
of the gross earnings of the Terre Haute
and Peoria Railroad should be devoted to
the payment of the interest on tne Terre
Haute and Peoria bonds, taxes and rentais,
the remainder of the 30 per cent, if there
should be any, to be paid to the Terre
Haute and Peoria Railroud.
The complainants aver that the interest
has not been paid, though the 30 per cent
of the gross f arni.igs would have been suf
ficient to have paid it. The gross earn
ings since the defendant company took
po* ession of the Tcrre Haute and Peoria
have been as follows: Sot the thirteen
months ending October 31, 1893. $449,
-520 33; for the year ending October 31,
1b94, $404 014 69; for the year ending
October 31, 1895, $447,483; October 1, 1895,
up to September 1, 1896 (ostimated), $340,
-000; all of which money, it is alleged, has
been appropriated by the defendant.
Tne bill recites that the defendant com
pany is op*r.iting the Tcrre Haute and
Loaansport Railroad and has agreed to
pay the interest and principal on $1,500,000
of its bonds: that it is operating the Terre
Haute and Indianapolis Railroad and has
agreed to pay the principal and interest on
an issue of firs', mortgage bonds to the
amount of $4.50 000.
It is then shown that the Pennsylvania
company owns about half the stock of the
Vandalia. It is set forth that interest to
the amount ol $91,000 on bonds of the St.
Louis, Vandalia and Terre Haute will fall
due November 1 and that it is the belief
of tbe complainants that itwiil not be
paid. The complainants also aver that
"tbe principal ana interest on the tirst
mortÂ«jaj.'e bonds due January 1, 1897, will
not be paid when due; that upon this
contingency the obligations of the Terre
Haute and Indianapolis and of the Pitts
burg, Cincinnati and St. Louis will be
come enforcible; that in that case the
Terre Haute i.nd Indianapolis will be un
able to comply, and a claim wiil be cre
ated against t!:e defendant for reimburse
ment ofus proportion.,"

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 13.â For the

this morning. Nearly 20C0 delegates and
visitors were present when Miss Frances
E. Willard called the convention to order.
The executive committee recommended

heroines of rank and tile who had
borne and labored and had had patience
when the W. C. T. U. "passed under the
rod of a Nation's criticism." She said:
"We have marched far since then, and
alignments of parties have changed. The
labor movement has taken on proportions
so vast that no one speaks lightly of it
any more."
Continuing, Miss Willard expressed the
warmest appreciation of the white ribbon
women of St. Louis, who, undeterred by
the calamity of the cyclone, invited the
convention and had made generous and
eluborae provision for its entertainment.
In 1884, only a few days previous to the
Presidential election, the W. C. T. U. met
here and ventured on the high seas of
political contention. They had espoused
the cause of the prohibition party and
called down curses on their devoted heads.
She continued:
"The labor movement has taken on pro
portions so vast that no one speaks lichtly
of it any more; the people are forging
their way to the front, misguided often,
making pitiful paths in the wilderness;
following false lights and relegating the
fight for a clear brain to the spartan
band of prohibitionists, when, if labor
would win, it must make the temperance
reform the ark of God, to be borne in thp
very van of its swift, gathering army.
"In 1892," Miss Willard continued,
"some of us sat up all night with the
committee on resolutions of the great
labor convention, with its thousand dele
gates, pleading with them to put a prohi
bition and a home- protection plank in
their platform and they would not."
She said that prohibition in politics has
been and is now and is to be the embodied
protest of the home against the saloon.
It held up a torch in the gloom and ir. set
the keynote of a divine anthem of liberty.
When the white-ribbon women plighted
their faith to the movement it had polled
only 10,000 votes. In 1884 the number
rose to 150,000, and had gone on slowly
increasing until 250.000 had been gathered ;
but, owing to the controversy concerning
the free coinage of silver, this party, like
every other, had split in twain in this
memorable year of 1896 and the vote ha 1
fallen off to about 200,000 out of 14,000,000
of ballots.
"When we were in St. Louis twelve
years ago," she continued, "we declared
for the only party that was pledged to
prohibition and the home- protection bal
lot, but as there are now two parties so
pledged we cannot !n conscience declare
for either; but we are, I hope, the earnest
friends of both and shall in this conven
tion make it plain that we will lend our
influence to any party that incorporates
onr principles into its platform. Ido not
mean that we shall indorse all the planks
in that platform, but only those that em
bo iy our principles."
Miss Willard spoke of the woman's bal
lot as "the surest method of political pro
hibition." She emphasized the declara
tion of the California suffragists that tliey
were defeated by the liquor league, and
rejoiced in the victory for woman's ballot
that seems to have been eained in Idaho.
She made ihe point that the men of
Wyoming, after having watched the
workings of woman's suffrage for twenty
years, had incorporated it into their con
stitution, and that if the men of Kansas,
Colorado and Utah had felt that the effect
of the enfranchisement of women had
been to make them less loyal to the home
and all that it involves, they would never
have given them the ballot.
She stated that the world's Woman's
Christian Temperance Union intended to
take up the work for the Armenians aa an
important part of its endeavor; they
would probably found a colony fn Cyprus
for the women and children.
She gave notice that the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union would call
upon all temperance and philanthropic
societies throughout the world to set apart
March 20, the birthday of General Neal
Dow, as "prohibition day."
Miss Willard closed with an affectionate
mention of Mrs. Letitia Yonmans of Can
ada, the white ribbon pioneer in that
country, and Mrs. Sallie Chapman, both of
whom have recently died.
At the conclusion of Miss Wiliard's ad
dress, a pretty incident occurred. Fifty
eight young lady pupils in a local semi
nary marched upon the platform, each
carrying a huge chrysanthemum, which
they presented to the president in honoi
of the nfty-eieht milestones which &he has
passed on the journey of life.
The entire audience arose and again
waved the Chautauqua salute.
The report of the corresponding secre
tary sumÂ« up the year's work as follows:
Total number of new unions organized,
1175; total numbei of new members
gained, 15,888. That the gains as shown
by the treasurer's books are not larger by
no means invalidates this record. In too
many instances the gain has been offset
by a corresponding loss; in others ''hard
times" has been a potent lactor, prevent
ing the payment of dues; in still others
many members joined in the last half of
the year and paid for six months only,
thus making it necessary to count two as
one. Without doubt the results of this
year's worK will count largely in the gains
of next
The organizera will report for them-
selves at a later period in the convention.
In addition to the work of the regular
organizers and the National oflicers, to be
hereinafter reported, the va-Â«t majority of
States have had corps of State officers and
organizers going about within their bor
ders continually. Many of the State
presidents have been constantly afield,
and many others would gladly havegivea
their entire time to the field, but have
been prevented through force of circum
stances or for lack of funds in the State
treasury.
At the beginning of the afternoon ses
sion President Willard introduced to the
convention Mr.Â«. R. Mitchell of Idaho,
with a congratulatory word for the success
of suffrage in that State.
The afternoon was almost entirely de
voted to the reading of reports, including
those of Corresponding Secretary Kathe
rine 1m Stevenson of Massachusetts and
Treasurer Helen If. Barker of Illinois.
Among the other report? presented were
those of the following superintendents of
departments: Mrs. Hanna J. Bailey of
Maine, "Peace of International Arbitra
tion"; Miss Marie C. Brehan of Illinois,
"Franchise"; Mrs. Margaret B. Eliis of
New Jersey, "Legislation and Enforce
ment of the Law"; Mrs. Mary D. Tomlin
son of New jersey, "Parlor Meetings";
Mrs. Mary Wood Allen of Michigan,
"Purity"; Mrs. Mary F. Lovell of Penn
sylvania, "Mercy"; Mrs, Josephine Bate
ham of Kentucky, "Sabbath Observance."
During the afternoon session the order
of business was finally suspended to
accept by a rising vote the annual address
of President Willard.
The various reports were received with
applause and then accepted by the con
vention and ordered printed in the an
nual report. The auditor certified to the
correctness o* the treasurer's report.
The evening session was presided over
by Mrs. L. M. N. Stevenson of Maine,
vice-president at large.
The devotional exercises were conducted
by Mrs. J. K. Barney of Rhode Island.
No Ixisiness was transacted, the evening
beins; devoted to addresses of welcome.
The audience was asked to contribute to
the finances of the union and a generous
sum was realized. After benediction the
convention adjourned until 9 o'clock to
morrow morning.
VERY SWIFT IS THE IOWA
Successful Builders' Trial Trip
of the Battle-ship Off
Delaware Capes.
With Litt c Effort the Big Vessel
Exceeds the Contract Re
qnirements.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov. 13.â The
big sea-going battle-ship lowa returned
here to-day from her builders' trial trip off
the Delaware capes. The trial was essen
tially an engineer's trial to give the snip's
builders an idea of tne power of the en
gines and the way in which they worked,
and the speed developed was a secondary
consideration of the trip. Nevertheless on
a two hours' burst of speed this morning
the ship averaged 16.27 Knots at 112 revo
lutions of the screws. This is .27 mure
than the contract speed of the vessel calls
for, and that the lowa is capable of better
than this was shown when she occasion
ally spurted up and around tbe 17-knot
notch. The result of the trip was in every
way satisfactory to Edwin S. Cramp, who
had it in charge for the builders.
The lowa left here on Tuesday at noon
and mace the run to the breakwater on
one tide, arriving there that night The
Government was represented by Lieu
tenant Doyle, ordnance officer stationed
at the yard, and Assistant Engineer Pick
erel. Besides these gentlemen there were
a number of guests aboard.
On Wednesday morning, after adjusting
the ship's compasses, the lowa ran oil
shore twenty miles and was steamed four
times over tbe 10-knot course between the
two lightships on five taihoni bank shoal.
The engines were given a good limbering
up and at ninety-five revolutions 14'^
knots were made.
On Wednesday night the lowa anchored
witnin the capes and went out again
Tnursday morning. She was run straight
offshore for sixty miles and 110 revolu
tions of the screws were maintained. The
result of tue run Thursday was satisfac
tory to the engineering department and
she returned to tier anchorage inside the
capes again on Thursday night.
The lowa mil lacks all of her guns, but
these have been finished and some of
them are lying on the wharf at Cramps'
and the balance are being shipped here.
It is expected that the ship will be
ready to go on her official trial trip about
the middle of Februaiy, and by that time
she will be so nearly completed that .she
can go into commission in March.
WRECKED IN A BLIZZARD.
Captain and Crew of a Lake Steamer
Biave a Rough Experience.
SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich., Nov. 13.â
Captain John Clifford of tiie propeller
Acadia, which left Fort William, Ontario,
November 4, and which was Jong overdue
at this port, reached here in a sailboat
late this afternoon. He reports that the
Acadia went ashore on Michipicoten
Island in a blinding snowstorm and heavy
gale on Thursday, November 5, when she
was about twenty-four hours out from
Fort William. All of the crew reached
shore in safety and Captain Clifford re
ports all well. The Acadia in a total
wreck, however. Bhe had a cargo of 2-3,000
bushels of wheat, besides some mis
cellaneous freight. Sne was valued at
$25,000, and both the vessel and cargo are
insured.
STEAMERS IN COLLISION.
A Rig JSew Freighter JCmi* Into an Out-
going Vessel at Aetc York.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 13.â Ihe big
new freighter Persia of the Hamburg-
American line collided with an outward
bound steamer to-night. Details of the
accident were hardly obtainable to-night.
The chief officer of the Persia was quite
averse to talking about the affair when
*een on board his ship as she lay at her
dock in Hoboken to-night. He admitted
that the Persia had "brushed" against
another steamer.
He refused to say just how the accident
occurred. He did not know the name of
the steamer with which his ship was in
collision, nor did he know the line to
which she belonged.
He thought the other ship was not much
injured and said that the injuries to the
Persia were slight and ail atove the water
line. It was learned from an official of
the line, who was seen on the dock, that
two children were injure), both having
their hands crnsned. Further informa
tion regarding the collision could not be
bad.

ONE MORE DISPUTE
TO BE ARBITRATED
Costa Rica and Colombia
Agree to Settlement of
Boundaries.
Fixing of the Territorial Divis-
ional Lines to Ec Left to
Friendly Powers.
AFTER YEARS CF DIPLOMACY-
This Announc m- nt Coming so Quickly
After the Venezuelan Case
Pleases Unc.e Sam.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13.âAn
other long standing American boundary
dispute is to be settled by arbitration in ac
cordance with a treaty executed several
days a-;o at Bogota, by which the Costa
Rica and Colombian governments have
agreed to leave their territorial divisional
line to the adjudication of the President of
France, or in the event that he cannot un
dertake the responsibility President Diaz
of Mexico will be asked, and as a measure
of extreme precaution in case two refusals
are received the never failing last resource
of a reference to the President of Switzer
land is provided in the convention.
Secretary Olney has just been officially
informed of this arrangement by Senor
Calvo, the Costa Rican Minister, to whom
he expressed gratification in the most cor
dial terms.
The announcement coming so qnickly
after tbe substantial settlement of tbe
Guiana controversy is very pleasin to the
United States, as in both cases the United
States has been instrumental in s-curing
arbitration, our negotiation in the Costa
Rican-Colombian question having been
confined, however, to an earnest
expression of concern and a proffer of good
offices and not to an undertaking of forc
ing one of the disputants to terms.
On Secretary Bayard's advice, the con
troversy, which involves a large and valu
able tract of tbe American isthmus, was
referred to Spain for delimitation, that
monarchy at the time being engaged in
drawing a boundary line between Vene
zuela and Colombia.
The Spanish Government, while acced
iug to the request, deferred taking up the
Costa Rican case until it could complete
the Venezuelan-Colombian boundary case,
which involved considerable work. In
the delay Costa Rica made considerable
grants to a New Jersey company for a road
i/ova Bocas del Toro to the Interior with
grants of land, besides awarding to tne
Panama Canal Company over a million
acres located wholly within the limits
strenuously claimed by the South Ameri
can republic.
In the resulting friction Colombia
claimed that the time within which Spain
should have acted on the boundary ques
tion had expired, and in 1891 withdrew
from i!s treaty. Two years ago Secretary
Gresham urged tbe countries to submit the
matter to impartial adjudication, and from
negotiations then inaugurated the treaty
of Bogota is the outcome.
Costa Rica claims on the Atlantic coast
as far south as the island of E^cudo de
Veragua and the xiver Chiriqui, inclusive,
and on the Pacific as far as Burica Point.
Colombia claims north to Cape Graclas
Adios on the Atlantic and to the river
Colfito, emptying into the Golfo Dulce, on
the Pacific.
The United States has large inter 'Bts in
this territory, particularly at and near
Bocas del Toro.
TO PREVENT SEA COLLISIONS.
Revised International Rules to Go Into
Effect in July.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13.â The
revised international rules to prevent col
lisions at sea, drafted by the Washington
International Marine Conference, will
probably go into effect on the Ist of next
July. The officers of the State and Treas
urey departments have been working earn
estly to th;s end since the adjournment of
Concress, and Great Britain is co-operat
ine wt th the United States in securing the
assent of the remaining nations which
have not accepted the new rules.
The following nations have agreed to
adopt the rules and enforce them after
July 1: Great Britain, German}', France,
Denmark, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Aus
tria, Belgium, Spain, Hawaii, Jaimn, Mex
ico, Guatemala, Chile and Honduras.
These nations, with the United btates,
control 22,000,000 tons, or more than five
sixths of the world's shipping. The im
portant nations whose assents have not
yet been received are: Norway, Sweden,
the Netherlands, Brazil and Turkey, con
trolling about 3,000,000 tons of shipping.
ALL FINES ARE REMITTED
Why the Steamer lioyne. Hid Aot Hive a
I' roper Manifr.it.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13.â Acting
Secretary Hamlin yesterday remitted a
fine of $500 imposed on the British
steamer Uoyne ior failure to produce
proper manifest. After the vessel was
la en at Smyrna the Turks threatened to
take some Armenian cabin passengers out
of her. The following day the Uniied
States man-of-war Minneapolis arrived
and Admirbl Kelfridge informed the mas
ter that he would protect him if an at
tempt were made to take the passengers
from (he ship by force, but advised him to
leave the port as soon as possible to avoid
complications.
The consignors of the merchandise also
advised him to sail immediately, and the
American Consul gave him the same ad
vice, and also gave him a bill ot health.
A complete manifest was forwarded from
Smyrna by mail and b;is been presented
at the New York Custom-house.
CARRYING LOTTERY TICKETS.
A Case of Great Interest Before the
Supreme Court.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 1&â "Is
the carrying of lottery tickets or drawings
from one State to another commerce
within the meaning of the constitution?"
is a question which the Supreme Court of
the United States took under considera
tion this afternoon after argument by J.
D. Goldsmith ana James C. Carter, of New
York, and Assistant Attorney - General
Whitney. The case at bar was that ol
Al bert 1* France and eight others vs. the
United States, from the District Court for
the southern d strict of Ohio. They had
been ci-nvicied of conspiracy to commit
an offense against the Uiitsri States by
causing; to be carr eot from Lovington, Ky..
to Cincinnati, Ohio, a number of policy
lottery tickets, and had been lined $1000
each, with iniprisoment added.
The daily transier of the policy-slips
over the dncinnati-Covington bridge was
the crime which the plaintiffs in error
were charped with.
For the Government it was maintained
by Assistant Attorney-General Whitney
that the carrying of slips in question was
commerce within the meaning of the con
stitution and the decision of the courts,
and that the act involved therefore was
valid and constitutional.
Mr. Carter and associate counsel main
tained that it was not commerce, and that
tbe law, therefore, was unconstitutional.
There was a mil bench of Justices
present, and they listened to theargument
with much interest.
LEAVES PLACID PEI HO
After Beating on the Mud Banks the
Monacncij Departs.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13.â The
United States cruiser Monacacy has moved
after a year and three days' repose on the
mud banks of the Pei Ho River at Tien
tsin. A cablegram from her commander,
Lieutenant Roes, who recently displaced
Commander Reisinger, in charge of this
naval anomaly, announced her successful
navigation as far as Tong Ku, thirty miles
down the river from her former habita
tion, and she is now opposite the famed
Tuku forts, near the mouth of the river,
whenct, if her recent exptdition has not
developed strains, she may go by easy
stages as far as Shanghai for the wir.ter.
Her cruise to-day was a great surprise to
tbe officials of the department, who sup
pose her commander undertooK to remove
the ship as the result of a bet that tbe in
tegrity of her bottom was not wholly de
pendent upon tne fact that it rested on the
mud bea of the placid Pei Ho.
Admiral Katnsay's Report.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13.â The
annual report of Admiral F. M. Ramsay,
chief of the Bureau of Navigation, shows
that during the past year tho cruisers and
battle-sbips Indiana, Massachusetts, Ore
gon, Texas, Boston, Mr>nadnock, Terror,
Monongahela and Adams were commis
sioned for service. At the ciose o'. the
fiscal year 31 per cent of the enlisted men
in the navy were serving under continous
service. More than 72 percent of the en
listed men were American citizens and
more than 82 per cent of the apprentice
boys were Am rican born.
SHOULD LOVE THE SEA,
Naval Academy Cadets Too
Fond of Dry Land
Sports.
Sailing Vessels, Says the Superin
tendent, Are Required to
Train O.fi;ers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13.â The
SuDerintendent of the Naval Academy in
his annual report says:
"The department has been forced to re
move the Bancroft from the Navai Acad
emy through exigencies of service, and in
my opinion she will make a much better
cruiser for station du'y than a cadet prac
tice steamer. A vessel with greater ac
commodation for endets, or about the
same tonnaec, ~Â»'ill be more efficient, es
pecially if composite built or wooden
sheathed. The vessel should have consid
erable sail power and with a single screw.
Engineering practice can be as well
taught with one engine as with two. The
Bancroft could not well berth more than
th'rty cadets, whereas one cf the gunboat
class now building will accommodate
seventy-five to 100 cadets, in addition to
ihe crew."
The superintendent, Captain Cooper,
urges that slipping on sailing vessels is
preferable to that on steamers for :adets.
Ha declares: "It is entirely useless to
argue that sufficiently good seamen can
be made on board steamers or auxiliary
steamers, for there is an education oi the
nerve? and brain and the habit of com
mand which can only be inculcated in the
same school which has reared the greatest
naval commanders the world has seen,
and that school has been the sailing ship.
The handling of the greatest modern
battle-snip singly or in fleets and the in
evi able return to sail-power in cruising
vessels demand the highest order of sea
training, and it is at this school that the
foundation must be laid. Seamen are not
born such ; they are made, and this is the
formative period of the lives of future
naval officers."
The superintendent strongly urges his
recommendation that Congress be urged
to authorize the building ol i?ro moderate
sized composite sailing vessels, which
should be supplemented by two small
brigs for stationary work, and says every
thing within reason should be done to en
courage a love for water, whereas the dis
position has been to turn too much to the
a hletics of the field in compeiion with
secular colleges. The idea of main aining
the sports on the element for which the
young men are destined has become a
strange and repugnant tiling.

TO BE GOVERNED
BY THE LEAGUE
Wings of the Arbitration
Board Are Decidedly-
Clipped.
Apparent Change of Factional
Strength Made in the Inter
ests of Harmony.
WATCHING THS RUSIE SUITS.
It Is Decided to Stop the Objectionable
Souvenir Games of Base
ball.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 13.â 8y a vote cf
7to 5, Louisville and Washington voting
with the big five minority faction, the
National League of Baseball Clubs at ita
concluding session this evening decided to
clip the wings of the National Board of
Arbitration by striking out that part of
section 34 of the National agreement
which provided that an amendment couid
be made by unanimous consent of the
board. Now the league is the only au
thority competent to change the National
agreement and the arbitration beard is not
the arbiter of its own jurisdiction. This
apparent change of factional strength
was made by the Brush majority of 3even
in the interest of harmony and to show
the minority faction that the magnani
mous victors did not want to arrogate to
the arbitration board, which they control'
the arbitrary powers which the "big five'
are credited with scheming for until Louis
ville turned the tables.
"The "big five," being outvoted in the
arbitration board, were willing to settle
now instead of at the spring meeting the
question of power to touch the National
agreement, so they voted to strike out.
Both sides professed to be satisfied with
the action taken, and there was more
friendliness displayed than at any time
since the league met.
The Rusie suits against the New York
Club}formed a subject for much talk at the
meeting. Mr. freedman said that a reso
lution was adopted by a vote of eight to
fourâ Baltimore, Louisville and Washing
ton voting with the "big five" â pledging
the support of the league to the New York
Club in the matter, but he would not say
the expenses were to be paid by the league.
Colonel Rogers of Philadelphia said that
Charles M. Shoran, tbe Chicago club's
'awyer, had been retained by the New
York club here to defend the Rusie suits
and that the colonel would appear at the
trials to attend to the baseball end. This
action was reported to the league and Mr.
Freedman made a few warm remarks, al
leging that certain members bad insti
gated Rn-ie to bring the suits. Mr. Wag
ner of Washington moved to reconsider
the vote taken yesterday in refusing to
reinstate the last section of the National
agreement.
Colonel Rogers of Philadelphia moved
that the National agreement be not
changed except by majority vote of the
league, and this proposition, taken from
the arbitration board dictatorial power,
was carried by the 7 to 5 vote mentioned.
The treasurer was instructed to pay Henry
Chadwick, the father of baseball. $50 a
month during the. remainder of his lite, in
recognition for his past services and for
what he may do hereafter for the playing
rules committee.
Tbe chairman was instructed to ap
point a committee of three, of which Mr.
Young is to be chairman, to devise if pos
sible a better mean? for controlling um
pires and to make its report at the spring
meeting. The scheme is to have some
one travel around tbe circuit at Young's
direction and watch the playing.
The objectionable souvenir games will
not be allowed any more. Mr. Robison
spoke of their atuse and they were or
dered discontinue i.
Mr. Hart of Chicago renewed bis peti
tion of last year for the abolition of the
Temple cup game?, but it was laid on the
table â 10 to 2. The league adjourned to
meet in Baltimore the last Thursday m
February.
At the afternoon session the new salary
agreement was presented and adopted.
The remainder of the session was de
voted to clearing up odds and ends, and
at 5:30 o'clock the meeting finally ad
journed, the magnates leaving for their
homes this evening.
AT THE BURSE SHOW.
High Jumping .ttnotxj the Attractions at
the Gardens.
NEW YORK. N. V., Not. 13.â The
horse show still lives in popular favor.
Tne society bus filled the boxes all the
week and horsemen have been on hand as
usual, but the masses have not put in an
appearance until to-day. Madison-square
Garden was comfortably filled by about
8000 people this afternoon and it was
jammed to-night. Fully 10.000 people
were present. The promenade was a sea
of humanity and every seat, even in the
top gallery, was taken.
The programme of the day was one of
the best of the week. The mo3t showy
classes were judged, and the awarding of
championship prizes in the classes for
hackney stallions, mares and fillies in the
afternoon and the contest over the high
jump at night made sensational features.
There was but one class for ladies' saddle
horses, ridaen by ladies only, which
brought fourteen fine animals into the
ring, and was captured by Miss Doremus
Chester. The latter was defeated later by
C. L. Railey's Kentucky horse, Patsy Me-
Cord, which was given the saddie-horse
championship prize.
The final event to-night was the high
jump, open to all. For the first trial the
bars were placed at 5 feet. They were

TO CONTEST THE ELECTION
Defeated Candidates in Utah Have Dis-
covered Many Irregularities in the
Polling System.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Nov. 13.â The late
election in Utah is to be contested on the
ground that it was conducted contrary to
the requirements of the State constitution,
which provides for a secret ballot. The
system adopted was a variety of the Aus
tralian ballot method, but was so arranged
tbat the registered number of the voter
was placed on the corner of bis ballot b>
the election judges, and by reference to
the ballots and the registration lists it is
easy to find out just how every voter cast
his ballot.
The contestants are some of the defeated
candidates and present officeholders, und
they say thÂ«y are not seeking personal
gain, but as the majorities in favor of the
successful candidates are so enormous,
even if the courts hold the election to be
illegal they will resign and allow those
who received the majority of the votes to
assume the offices. Their object in making
tbe contest ia to prevent complications in
the future and to have the system of elec
tion placed on a legal basis.
Tbe Presidential electors r.nd the Con
gressmen so far have not become parties
to the suit, but the ruling of the court,
whatever it may be, will doubtless apply
to them as to all other candidates, and
what the result in their cases would be in
case the court rules tbe election void
nobody seems to know.
FROM GOTHAM TO WASHINGTON
The Headquarters of the Republican Ra
tional < o-'iniittre to Be Iransferred.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 13.â There
appear to be good grounds for believing
that the headquarters of the Reppblican
National Committee during the rest of the
J terra will be transferred from New York to
this city. Mr. Hanna, who is now in Chi
cago, closed the quarters in that city to-
I day. The Congressional Committee, which
will have another contest on its hands tteo
years hence, will continue to have its
headquarters In Washington and will
maintain an effective but limited force of
clerks, ulthouÃh the building in which
they will work has not yet been agreed
upon. These two committees have been
working together in perfect harmony dur
ing the late campaign, and, owing to the
great amount of labor that can be done by
the Congressional Committee at a com
paratively small cost, Mr. Hanna believes
the two should be housed together, so that
the National Committee can secure the
assistance of its co-workers.
Shortly after Congress meets, when all
the members of the Congressional Com
mittee will be here, it is understood that a
conference of the two committees will be
held, when the plan now tentatively
agreed upon by Mr. Hanna and Chairman
Babcock of the other committee wiil be
carefully worked out. With tbe beginning
of the new year, it is supposed tbe head
quarters at New York will bo closed.
SEWALL YET FOR SILVER.
Like Others, He Is Very Busy in Ex-
plaining the Defeat.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 13.â Arthur
Sewall of Maine, late candidate of the
Democratic party for Vice- President, is at
the Holland House. He was seen this
morning as he was at breakfast with
Erskine M. Phelps of Chicago, a former
member of the Democratic National Com
mittee. Mr. bewail said that his visit
here had absolutely nothing to do with
politics. He is on his way to Florida.
"The recent election." said Mr. Sewall,
"was a grand silver victory, when it is
considered that the whole power of the
press, the pulpit and the money forces of
the country were arrayed in opposition.
The silver cause was never so vigorous as
now and is far from dying out. It will con r
tinue to be the great political issue, and
will be victorious four years hence. The
future looks very bright for silver."

Alaska, arrived home last night. Regard
ing a passage to the North Pole via Alaska
he said:
"I believe it i* possible to reach the
north pole in that direction. Whalers
told me that it was not uncommon in
favorable years to go as far as 85 degrees
latitude, and I believe at favorable times
of the year when the direction of the ice
is northward, that it could be reached in
that way. I believe that lam safe in say
ine that an expedition will be fitted out in

made to reach tbe pole by way of Alaska." 1 '
TEN TIMES A BIGAMIST
Ugly Â«T. H. Hart Proud of His Abilities
as a "Lady Catcher
PADUCAH, Ky., Nov. 13.â While J. H.
Hart is on trial in the Graves County
court at Mayfield for bigamy, six of his
eight living wives and four young chil
dren sit near him. Although not a bit
good-looking, Hart is believed to have
been married at least ten times. His
matrimonial relations cover over four
States.
He is 48 years of age, bald-headed and
bow-legged. Yesterday three of his
wiveB â one from Missouri, one from Ten
nessee and one from Kentucky â arrived.
One was nursing a baby in arms and the
second led Â» little boy. The tnird will
soon add another member to Hart's
family.
The, trio visited the jail together, and
Hart, not a bit embarrassed, chatted with,
all three of them for some time. Several
of the bigamist's victims stop at the same
hotel. They live happily, atthoueh nearly
all of them call him "husband." Hart
do j s not deny his guilt, and seems proud
of his abilities as a lady catcher.

About the Navy of
Uncle Sam.
This Country Noted for Great
Shipbuilders and Seamen
of Valor.
IMPROVEMENT IN THE SEEVICI
O.ficers of the American Navy Nut
Surpassed by Any Body ol Men
in the World.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov.Rl3.â The an
nual dinner of the Society of Naval Archi
tects and Marine Knjineers was held to
night at Del monico's. President Clement
A. Griscom ure^ided, and covers were laid
for 150 guesis. Tne guest of the evening
was Secretary of the Navy H. A. Herbert,
â¢wiio spoke to the toast of "The Navy of
the United States." He said:
It Is peculiarly appropriate that the naval
architects and marine engineers of the United
States and their guests should unite to-night
In a toast to our navy. Ihe American ship
builder is entitled to a large share in whatever
glory thdt navy has achieved in the past, and
â¢I think I am in a position also to say he is per
forming his full duty to it now and that tie
may be trussed in the future. When we read
of the glories that have so often followed our
country's flag on the higii seas we are much
too apt to remember only the officers and men
whose skill and courage shone resplendent In
the supreme hour of battle. The student of
history, searching for cause and effect, gives
credit also to those who provided '.he means
â¢with which battles were won, to the men who
built the shij.s that swung and v. ere at the
captain s will, and brought to bear at the word
of command the guns that decided the conflict.
The art of shipbuilding and civilization have
traveled hand in hand since history began;
e&ch has been essential to the other in peace
and in war. It was commerce carried in ships
along the borders of the Mediterranean that
was the mother of the civilization ot Greece
and Rome. It was tbe superior ships in the
combined navies of the Christian allies that
enabled them at the Lepanto, In the fifteenth
century, to annihilate the power ol the im
perious Saracen, wno then threatened all tbe
Christian peoples of Southern Europe with the
fate of the unfortunate Armenians of to-day.
We are shipbuilders and sailors by inheri
tance, and no nation has ever more thoroughly
understood the value of first-class naval ships
and first-class guns than we. It has been our
traditional policy to have our ships and guns,
if j.osEiDie, to be just, a little better than those
of the same class belonging to our possible
enemies. So it was that we had a slight ad
vantage over the British in most of the famous
duels of ships at sea that made our flag so
glorious in the war of 1812, and we have
steadily aimed to pursue that policy from that
day to this.
i.yen while our Civil War was on the great
naval powers of Europe took up the lessons we
had taught and the days of the old-time man
of-war soon passed away forever. For nearly
twenty years after our Civil War very little of
V-Actlcal value was added to our navy. We
rested irom ship-building, but other nations
made vast strides in the construction of armor
and ships and guns and torpedoes. Then
Secretary Chandler began our new navy by
â¢laying down four vessels, all of which are
vessels to-day. Secretary Whitney followed
Secretary Chandler, and with larger appro
priations at hand there grew up under him
an armor plant, plants for the forgings of
great guns, a plant at Connecticut for the
manufacture of rapid-fire guns, and during
his administration of tbe navy American
establishments turned out all the shapes and
angles and shaftings and other material that
go into a ship.
Secretary Tracey followed, and tinder him
another armor plant grew up. A torpedo
manufacturing plant was established and im
provements were made in the form of armor
which have been adopted all over the world.
The present administration has endeavored to
follow In the same lines, and it is believed
that to-day our gunboats, our cruisers, our
harbor-defense ships, our battle-ships and our
torpedo-boats just contracted for, our great
guns and small guns, our torpedoes, our pow
der and high explosives are equal to any in
the world.
Preparations are complete for tbe continua
tion of, and I hope we shall continue, the pro
gramme of increasing our navy. A first-class
modern man-of-war, such as we are now con
structing ana have constructed, is the sum of
all human inventions. Nowhere in all the
wide range of industries of the world can be
found more splendid exemplifications of en
terprise and genius than in these exploits of
American mechanics.
The veterans of that great war are rapidly
passing into history, but there need be no fear
of those in whose hands they will leave the
honor of our flag. In culture, in capacity, in
character, the officers of the navy to-day are
not surpassed by any body of men In the
world. Their morals and discipline are
anmireble.
Our enlisted men as a body are being rapidly
more thoroughly Americanized; they are well
disciplined and can be implicitly relied on.
Let me assure you that whenever and wher
ever our navy is called upon it will be found
on the alert ready for its work whichever and
wherever that work may be.
Other speakers were: Hugh Kelly,
president of the Maritime Exchanee, who
responded to the toast, "The Maritime
Exchange" ; Congressman-elect BelforJ C
Loring, Captain J. W. Miller, commander
of the naval reserves of New\ork; Chief
Constructor P ilip Hichborn and General
Thomas W. Hyde.
ENACHIS OF LABOR.
Many Matters of Interest to the Order
Are Considered.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Nov. 13.â The
only business of interest transacted by the
Kniebts of Labor at the morning session
was the passage of an amendment to the
constitution permitting the organization
of junior assemblies, to which apprentices
will be allowed membership.
The general assembly sat again this
afternoon, and it was not until 4:30
o'ciock that an adjournment was taken.
The law committee had the floor and
several important constitutional amend
ments were presented and pass-ea. A
considerable authority, which has hitherto
been exercised by the executive board, was
taken rom it and assumed by the general
assembly.
The General Assembly now has the
power to enforce the laws of the organiza
tion between yearly sessions. Hereafter
in the case of a minor official being dis
qualified for holding office a temporary
official will be elected to fill bis place in
stead of calling on alike offirial from some
other district. Section 102 of the consti
tution w:-,s entirely stricken out. This
section was relative to the power of the
executive board. The law committee a'so
adopted resolutions covering the ques
tion of old District Assembly No. 24 of
Chicago, which was interested in the
stockyards strike of several years ago.
Resolutions have been passed to take
legal steps to prevent the new order formed
at that time from using the name by
which It is known, and also to compel it
to re und the money and return the
books, charter and other properly of the
disbanded assembly.
Op. motion of J. 1). Schonfarber of Mary

The assembly then adjourned until to
morrow.
CRIME OF A LITTLE GIRL
Accused of Having Murdered an infant
by Administering Arsenic in the
Milk.
NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 13.â A Jour
nal special from Oswego, N. V., says:
Fanny Scofield, a remarkably attractive
girl and only 13 years of age, is locked
up in tbe Oswego County Jail on the
charge of murder. She was taken there
yesterday by Coroner Vowinkel as a re
sult of his inquest into the death of Fern
Field, the two-year-old daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Albert FMd, who live on a farm
near the village of Mexico.
About a week ago ihe parents left the
little one in the nou-se asleep and went
into the field to work. On returning the
father found the child in convulsions and
called his wife, but the little one died be
iore medical aid arrived.
The Coroner held an inquest and
learned that the child had been well when
the parents left it. Later it awoke and
asked .'or something to eat. The little
prisoner gave it some milk. She says that
it was the same as the other milk in the
house. Dr. W. Manlius Smith of Syra
cuse made an analysis of the contents of
the baby's stomach and found that it con
tained arsenic. It is believed that Fanny
Scofield put "Rough on Rats" into tbe
milk.
Last July the only other child of the
Fields died, and it is now believed that
the Scotield girl had a hand in her death
also. The body will be exhumed and an
examination made. Fanny stoutly denies
that she had anything to do with the
deatb of the children. Her trip to the
jail was her first experience on the car's
and she had many questions to ask. She
was permitted to lodge with the Sheriff's
family and does not seem to realize her
position.
AN ARKANEAS RACE WAR.
White JUillhanda Trying to Drive Out
thÂ« Aegroe*.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 13.â A special
from El Dorado, Ark., says: The white
and colored laborers em poly ed At
Hawthorne Mills, twelve miles south of
here, have been waging a race war since
last Monday. The whites, who are largely
outnumbered by the negroes, declared
that the colored men should not be per
mitted to work in the mills, and warned
them to leave. The negroes did not go,
und a number of white men whipped a
neero.
That night a car and several tents in
which the negroes were sleeping were
surrounded by armed white men and
more than 100 shots were fired into the I
car tents. How many negro^ sÂ» were hurt |
cannot be ascertained, but it is known â 
ttiat a woman was fa ally wounded. The |
shooting is thought to have been for the
purpose of frightening the negroes away,
as when it ceased they were a.am warned
to leave, under pain of dea h.
Yesterday there was further rioting, the j
extent of which has not been ascertained,
but the Sheriff has gone there with a
posse of deputies to restore order. The j
mills were idle yesterday, neither whites j
nor blacks being at work. A report j
reached nere last evenine to the effect !
that tne injured woman had died and that j
serious trouble was imminent, the negroes.;
threatening to avenge her death.

Train- Robber*.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Nov. 13.â Frank
James, Jesses brother, yesterday an- j
nounced his willingness to guard express- !
cars against train-robbers, and guarantee
railroad companies full protection, for a
nominal salary and insurance for.' his
family in case of death, if retained in
this capacity James promises that no one j
train-robber or a dozen would ever get i
near enough to an express-car to secure
anything. Said he:
"The only way that they can rob a car |
that 1 am placed on to watch is for them !
to ditch the whole train and heap it up
together, and .then, if I have any life left
in me after the wreck and am within reach !
of my gun, I will still prevent them from

FURT OF A LAKE GALE.
Two Schooners in Great Danger, but
Ihrir Cretin Saved.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 13.â The

As the schooner Marine City was being |
towed into the river the line parted and !
she driited ashore. The schooner Brenton [
was soon afterward discovered outside
the breakwater in distress She will prob

The life-naving crew realized that in
the heavy seas nothing could be done to
reiease the schooner, and undertook to

masts. The men jumped into tbe icy
water of the lake and exerted every possi
ble effort to keep afloat, but were nnder
water most of the time.

Fish Commissioner James H. Morrison
this evening.
"My reasons for doing so are many and

I considered that as a member of this

take. I am thoroughly disgusted with
the whole affair, and have too many per
sonal and business mattera to attend to to
waste further time in endeavoring to turn
a farce into a reality. I have refused to
attend its meetings in the past because it
was entirely useless on my part.
"Every subject to be acted npon was
cut and dried before I arrived, and I had
no voice whatever in any of the affairs
which came before the commission. When
new men were to be employed I was
never even informed of it, and was to
tally unable to ascertain their fitness for
the position, and even now I know noth
ing of the qualihca.ions of any of the em
ployes, never having heard them discussed
before tbe board. I have, on tbe other hand,
never refused to sign any of the men's
claims, because I thine that, no mat
ter what a man's qualifications are for ihe
position he tilis, if he holds it and does
the work, he is entitled to his pay. But
kept in entire ignorance of the workings
of ttie commis ion as I have been, I have
had to sign warrants for men who of my
own Knowledge I did not Know whether
they had performed the work or not, and I
do not like to work in the dark.
"Before I became a m.niber of the
Board of Game Commissioners I always
understood that its functions were the
protection of the game and fish of the
State, and the game as well as tne lisb. I
had not ever looked upon the commission
as a mere social arrangement. The lish
are protected, 1 will allow that.
"It \i advantageous to tbe cannery in
terests that they should be, but go into
tbe open markets of San Francisco 10-day
and see how well the game are protected.
See bow well ihe members of the Fisu
Commission enforce the law for the pro
tection ol the feathered tribes. There is a
fund set aside for the prosecution of those
who expose game lor sale before the 15th
of October, but it has never been drawn
upon and no arrests have been made.
Market hunters have received notice to
lorward all the game they can secure to
the markets, and the law is flagrantly vio
laied every day.
"As a member of the commission I have
always protested against this and have
demanded that the deputies make arrests,
and that a conviction be attempted, yet
my protests have bet n of no avail, and in
consequence I have no hesitation in saying
that 1 will no longer lend my name to
this commission.
"I find no difficulty in enforcing the
law throughout this section of the coun
try. You never see game or fish offered
for sale out of season in Sacramento.
Why? Because would-be violators ot the
law realize that they will be punished
and punished severely. We have demon
strated, with the aid of but one deputy in
this treat section, that the law can be en
forced. We have made numerous arrests
and secured convictions in every case.
Why cannot this be done in San Fran
cisco?
"As to the appointment of Mr. Vogel
sang Ido not care to say anything, as I
know nothing of the gentleman, but 1
hope that he will consider the game in
terests of the State as well as the fish in
terests.
"I have refused to sign the report of the
Game and Fish Commission and I shall
still refuse to do so. lam by no means
satisfied with it. I know nothing of its
truth or lalsity, and in consequence I feel
that I acted rightly by refusing to lend
my name to it. lam sick and disgusted
with the commission and its doings and
will wash my hands of the entire affair."

SMUGGLERS IN TROUBLE.
Captain and Crew of an American. Teasel
Cnvfured by Mexicans.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 13.â Captain
Jensen and two sailors of the schooner
Ellen, captured by Mexican customs offi
cers on board the steamer Carlos Pacheco
at Rosalia Bay, have been given daily ex
aminations in court since their transpor
tation to Ensonada. Captain Mood: in
and two sailors who escaped to the main
lan d at the same time from the junk Pekin
to avoid capture, have not been overtaken
by the rurales sent after them, so far as
known. It is believed here by friends of
the men tnat one of the small schooners
hovering off the coast, near Rosalia, took
Moodlin and bis men after the Pacheco
disappeared. Complications are reported
as liKeiy to arise as a result of the capture
of. Jensen and his schooner .by Mexican
customs officers, sailing under . the . Pa
checo's flag, which is that of the Nicara
guan Government. Under the terms of a
mail contract between the owners of the
Pacbeco and the Mexican Government,
tne steamer is made available at any time
the Mexican officials may need her to go
after smugglers, but as towheiher such
an agreement is legal, authorities differ.
The schooner Ellen, now held by the
Mexicans, is under the American flag.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
13. â Dr. David Starr Jordan will return
from his trip to Washington on December
5. Such is his intention, according to
recent word Irom S:anford's president.
On Tuesday last he delivered an address
before the University of Minnesota and on
Saturday will deliver a lecture at the
Ind.ana State University, of whic he was
pres.dent before he accepted a like posi
tion at Staniord. President Swain of the
Indiana State University was at one time
a pupil of Dr. Jordan, and before his en
gagement as president o; that university
wan a head professor at Stanford. It is
probable that Standford's president will
spend several days at the scene of his first
labors as a college president among many
of his old friends.
Mme. Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler, the
great iiianiste whose recent iecital-in San
Francisco made sucu a decided impression.
gave a reciial this evening in the chapel to
a lair sized audience of students and
faculty members with tneir families. The
performance was in every way a remark
able success. The audience was most en
thus.astir, and tue wonderful arti-st very
kindly responded to numerou- encores.
Many who heard the performance are of
the opinion that the rendition of some of
the numbers was even more enjoyable
than that of Paderewski of the same crea
tions.
The women studenis of the university,
who do not reside on the campus, arecon
eratulating themselves on the fact that
to-morrow there wiÂ»l be formally opened
for their use a room especially fitted ap
for them. Their chief complaint has been
that when they had afternoon work and
brought their lunches from their home-,
and places of residence they had no place
provided as an eating and waiting room.
This lias been secured through the assist
ance of the wives of some of the profes
sors and is cozilv fixed up for rainy wea
ther.
The football men are busily engaged
each afternoon, under the supervision ot
Cross and his assistants, in perfecting
their play. Misfonuue has seemed to
camp here at Stanford during (he whole
of this season. More men have been
forced to lay off on account of injuries,
more or less serious, t .an In any previous
season. Notwithstanding the brignt pros
pects for Stanford at the beginning of the
season, and the large numoer oi players
out, these continued accidents have badly
handicapped the work of the team, and
at the present time not a single one oi
the most prominent Varsity halfbacks is
able to play. Two of them will probably
be oui again in a few days, but another
is not expected to be able to play again
before the game. The result is that thf re
is a feeling of ill-concealed uneasmes and
anxiety as the Thanksgiving game ap
proaches.
The men seem to be playing with a will
and are training continuously, to Captain
Fickert and tbe enthusiasts sml cxi ect to
give Berkeley a hard tussle. But tnere is
many a student who is wondering just
wiiat the outcome will be in a most uncer
tain manner â whether the cardinal will
again triumpn over tbe blue and or
whether the unbroken list of football vic
tories is to give way at last.

MOORE'S TRIAL FOR
MURDER AT NAPA
Schaug, to Whom He Con
fessed, Takes the
Stand.
The Prisoner's Story of Mrs.
Greenwood's Fate Offered
in Evidence.
CARL SCHMIDT ALSO IN COURT
Nothing Is Elicited From the Convict,
Who Shows Every Sign of
Insanity.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 13.â The trial of
William Moore was resumed this morn
ing. Captain Green wood was recalled and
testified with reference to the color of an
overcoat taken on the night of the murder
from his house.
W. B. Schaug told of his acquaintance
with Moore while in Los Angeles County,
and said that while he (Schaug) was con
ducting a saloon business there Moore
had frequently in the last year and a half
come to his saloon for liquor. During this
time Moore was known to the people of
that vicinity by the name of George
Knight. On the sth day of September last
Mcore came to Schaug's place and volun
tarily offered to make a confession, and
asked Schaug to write it down. Schaug
complied with his request, and the con
fession was taken down word for word.
That part of the confession relating to
the Greenwood murder was offered in evi
dence by the prosecution, and was as
follows:
I went to Napa City and worked for Cooper
In the Vernon mills. 1 boarded with Brad-
Bhaw. I went to work for Pete Lynch breaking
horses; was there two seasons and went by the
name of William Moore. While there 1 got
acquainted with Mrs. Greenwood. I had been
there Â» number of limes. Mr. Greenwood had
no friendship for me. After finishing work
for Pete I went to San Francisco and stopped
at the What Cheer House, on Washington
street. 1 registered under the name of Wil
liam Smith and left a change of clothes. 1
started beck to Napa City and at V&llejo I met
a green Dutchman. I- kuew that 1 could use
him later on. We stopped at the Greenwood
residence. Mrs. Greenwood was iv Napa City.
In a few minutes sue drove up in a buggy. I
helped her out and we both went into the
house. All the time the Dutchman was stand
ing on the porch. I told him to go and tie the
horse up. While he was gone Greenwood and
1 got into a tuss in the parlor. Greenwood
pulled his gun and 1 mine. T:ien the shooting
began. -Isiioi him through the left cheek and
knocked out one ;ooth. Ti.e same snot killed
his wi;e. I then tied him, bucked and gagged
him and took his horse and buggy and drove
to Nairn City to rob the Nhj>& City Bank. I
could not tind tne third man that was waiting
for me. We intended going to the ceshier's
house and take him to the bank and make him
open it. I took the horse ami biig^y back to
Greenwood's. This happened February 9,
1891. 1 went back to the What Cheer House
and changed my clothes and shaved before
crossing over to San Francisco.
Mr. Schaug testified that the defendant
made the statement without any induce
ment or hope of reward being offered to
him. The statement was written down by
Schaug, a small portion being written
each day for about twelve days. A copy
of the original was then made by the son
of Schaug and the original was destroyed.
This statement was then placed in the
bands of Sheriff Burr. During the mak
ing of the statement iloore positively said
to Sciiaug: "1 am William Moore; lam
the murderer of Mrs. Greenwood."
Much interest was manifested by the
people when Carl Schmidt was placed on
the stand. Long liad ifaey waited to see
if Moore would be identified by him.
Schmidt was arrested and convicted about
five years apo of the murder of Mrs. Green
wood. By his story, at the time of his
trial, he admitted being at tne Greenwood
place at the time of the murder, but then
said he was not the leading one in com
mittin-' the crime. To-day when placed
on the stand only vague answers were
given to the questions that were pro
pounded to him.
A recess was taken by order of the court
and an examination of Schmidt was held
in the Judge's chambers as to his sanity,
the Judge, the lawyers in the case, Dr.
Lawlor of San Quentin and Drs. Hennes
sey and Shurtleff of Napa being present at
the examination. Schmidt complained
that "signers" were talking to him con
tinually. Uegave many amusing answers
to the questions asked him. Dr. Lawiorof
San Quemui said that Schmidt is insane
and tuat he is kept on "crank alley," sepa
rate from the main body of prisoners.
Schmidt now says that he was never in
Napa County and never saw the Green
wood place. Of course, this was untrue.
The trial was then resumed. Mrs. Weyse
of Los Angeles was placed on the stand.
She testified that hhe knew Moore, a* he
had worked for her on her ranch near Los
Angeles. She also testified that Moore
told her that he murdered Mrs. Green
wood in Napa in February, 1891.
The court then adjourned nntil Tuesday
moruing.
Dr. Iloirlea Hentoreit from Office.
NAPA, Cal.. Nov. 13.â The board of
trustees ol the Napa State Insane Asylum
to-day ordered" that second assistant
- physician G. A. Bowles be removed from
â¢ nis office. Governor Budd and the newly
appointed trustee, Barrett, were present
at the investigation. The action was the
resu't of an assault made on resident
physician A. M. Gardner a short time aco
in the asylum business office by Dr.
Bowles. There is considerable specula
tion as to who will succeed Dr. Bowles,
Dr. D. Smith, third assistant physician,
being the most prominent candidate.

SEATTLE. Wash., Nov. 13.â Serious
washouts and landslides, occasioned by an
unprecedented rise of the Skykomish

AUBURN, Cal., Nov. 13.â Placer's Su

mysteries of tne affinities of the sexes as

SAN DIEGO PROSPECTORS
Return From a Trip to the
Rich Gold Mines of San
Francisqaito.
Consummate a Deal With the Owners
of the Lost Mine Which Prom
ises Great Results.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 13.â 0n the
steamer Pacheco, which returned from
Lower California to-day, were A. H.
Lacey and A. R. Bryson of Los Angeles',
who went down in company with John
T. Gaffey and other Los AnÂ«eles men, to
gether with Adolfo Bareno, to visit the
Bareno brothers' gold mines at San Fran
cisquito, 350 miles southeast of this city,
on the gulf coast of the peninsula. The
party was tne largest prospecting party
that ever left Ensenada and comprised
ten men and twenty animals. About six
weeKs was required for the round trip.
Mr. Gaffey returned several days ago, but
Messrs. Lacey and Bryson remained at
Ensenada to close up the deal for the
mine. Papers were signed whereby the
Barenos bond the propeities to Lacey
brothers and their associates for $100,000,
and the new managers are to erect a mill
and develop the mines at once, the im
provements to become the property of the
Barenos if the syndicate does not pur
chase the mine. Work on a large scale is
to begin, the supplies and machinery to be
shipped to tbe nearest port on the gulf
and transported thence by rail.
When seen to-day Mr. Lacey was very
uncommunicative and Mr. Brysou almost
as much so. They admitted that a deal
was about consummated, but refused to
say that it was closed. From an equally
reliable source, however, the above figures
were learned. Mr. Lacey said the mines
were very rich and everything that they
had been represented, but the isolation
and great cost of transporting supplies
and machinery prevented their develop
ment up to this time. By utilizing
schooners on the gulf, however, and build
ing roads to connect the mines with the
landing it is expected that the cost will
be reduced to a reasonable figure.
The principal mine of the group, on
which the Barenos have done enough
work to prove its richness, has a romantic
history.
It is called the Lost Mine. The father
of the Bareno brothers discovered it origi
nally and prospected it somewhat, but
while at work alone he was overcome with
mortal illness, and feeling that his time
bad come he marked signs upon a large
granite bowider near his camp indicating
the direction of the mine. The marks
were made with charcoal and covered with
greaÂ«e, which served as a paint that was
!<roof against the weather for a number of
years.
In their search for their father the
Bareno brothers stumbled upon the curi
ous marks upon the great bowlder and
near it discovered the bone 3of their
father. Following the signs as directed
they came upon the mine, which they
have worked ever since. The vein is very
rich and tears indications of developing
into the greatest bonanza yet uncovered
on the peninsula. Rock running as high
as $34,000 i er ton has been taken from the
shaft. The ore is said to average almost
$100 per ton_
FIERCE STORM UP NORTH

VESSELS SOUS AT ASTORIA.
Mishap to a Mirer tit- timer Which Causes
a J-iin ,r
ASTORIA, Or., Nov. 13.â One of the

raging for the past forty-eight hours, with
no immediate indications of abatement.
At Fort Canby Ooservatory the maximum
velocity of the wind waselgnty-two miles.
The damage so far has been slight, but
two mishaps of any consequence having
occurred.
During the afternoon the British ship
Penthesilea and British bark Criffe!
dragged their anchors and fouled, the
Penthesilea losing her mizzen topgallant
yard. The Criffel was uninjured. The
river steamer Grady, running between
this city and Portland, also had a mishap
whi c crossing Cathiamet Bay, her for

says that this will involve an outlay of j
$30,000, and continues:
"We can get an ample supply of mate
rial to work up; it will make us independ
ent of the East and cause a saving of $5 or
$6 a ton. At present the manufacturer
here .s at a great disauvantage. Tbe rail
roads charge just as much for the raw ma
terial as they do for the finished article.
At one time there was $10 a ton d -ff i_t
ence; then it was cut to $4, and now the
rate is the same. Why is tnis? You will
have to ask the raiiroad managers; they
are responsible for the discrimination
against the West."
It is learned that a marked increased de
mand exists here for mining machinery
for use principally la Arizona.
One of the big projects for the coming
year is a ten-story building at the north
west corner of Broadway and Second
streets. It is to put up for Charles Frost
of Pasadena.

ELOPED FROM VALLEJO.
John McGinnis and His Child
Sweetheart Arrested at
WoodianJ.
The Girl's Mo'her Had Contf mplated
Placing Her in a
Convent.
WOODLAND, Cal., Nov. 13.â A young
man and woman arrived in this city on
last night's train and proceeded to the
Byrns Hotel, where t! ey registered as
Maude Gardiner and William Gardiner,
both of San Francisco. They were as
signed to rooms 21 and 22, respectively.
Shortly afterward the couple appeared on
the street and went to a restaurant, where
they obtained supper. Their actions were
viewed with some suspicion by several
parties, as the young lady did not appear
to be more than Id years of age. It was
ascertained early ttiis morning that die
young couple had eloped from Vallejo.
Shortly afterward Deputy Malone of Be
nicia and Constable Blessin^ton of Va
llejo arrived in this city on a freight train
and proceeded to the Byrns Hotel, where
they found the two young people. They
were placed under arrest.
The youne man's name is John Mc-
Ginnis and he is employed as a brick
mason in the navy-yard at Vailejo. The
young lady proved to be Juliet Vashon,
who. it is claimed, is only 13 years of age.
About three months ago Mrs. Emma L.
Vasbon and daughter Juliet, whoi-e home
is in British Columbia, arrived at Vallejo
to pay an extended visit to relatives and
friends. Shortly after their arrival Mrs.
Vashon decided to place her daughter in
the convent at that place. On Thursday
evening tbe i;irl did not return to her
home at tbe usual hour, and Mrs. Vashon
began to make a search for her.
She soon learned that McGinnis and the
girl had procured a rig at the livery stable
and had been driven over to Benicia.
Mrs. Vasbon was very angry, and hunted
up a Justice of the !'â¢ acp and swor.' to a
complaint charging McGinnis with ab
duction. The warrant of arrest was placed
in the officers' hands and the latter boarded
a freight train for Davisville, where they
made connection with one ot the freight
trains which arrived in this city this
morning.
Young McGinnis does not seem to be
alarmed over his arrest, an'l says that he
w'll procure bail a* soon as he arrives at
Vallejo. Officers Malone and Blesstngton
left for B nicia on this afternoon's train
with the eloping coupie.

ery to be shipped from Stockton to Sonora.
Among other thin s was a big com
bined harvester, the like of which has
never been seeu in the section from which
Torres come*. At present the harvesting
is done by means of the old-styie mowers
and threshinc machines, but tne younger
blood in the State of Sonora has deter
mined to introduce more modern methods
and Stockton was selected as the place
where the newest agricultural appliances
could be secured.
Senor Torres left this afternoon for Sac

is expected by himself and party that they
will be able to rr.ake large purchases of

STOCKTON STEAMERS STRANDED.
Heavy Fog and Low Water Make It
Difficult to Keep in the Miadie
of the Stream.
STOCKTON, Cal., Nov. 13.â About 9
o'clock this mornin a telephone menage
was received at the Mail office from Boul
den Inland, stating that the steamer
Dauntless had run on a sandbar in tha
Kokelumne River, just opposite the land
ing there, near the junction of that
stream with the San Joaquin River. The
hoat had left the San Joaquin to go about
three miles up the Mokelumne to Valen
tine. She was on her uptrip to this city
and she was stranded about 1 o'clock this
morning. The two boats of the old
lineâ the J. D. Peters and the City of
Stockton â both got stuck coming up. The
City of Stockton arrived about 10 o'clock
this forenoon, and the Peters, which after
ward was floated, came in an hour later.
Navigation is rendered very difficult by
the extremely low water and the heavy
fog on the river, which makes it almost
impossible, except for the old-time pilots,
to keep in the middle of the stream. When
the tide rose the Dauntless, after repeated
attempts, managed to iorce itself orf the
bar and into d^ep water again. She pro
ceeded up to Valentine and there went
aground strain. She extricated herself a
second time, though, and proceeded on
her way to this city. She arrived here
about 2 o'clock. The passengers had a
nice daylight ride along the picturesque
San Joaquin, and tho.-e who were not in a
hurry were well pleased.
VANCOUVER COPPER FIND
Strange Incident That Lsd to
the Fortune of a
Farmer.
Through the Peculiar Medium of a
Bullfight He Locates a
Rich Claim.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 9.â When a
cow kicked over a lantern and precipi
tated upon the city of Chicago a tire which
will long be remembered on this conti
nent the bovine species came in for a large
share of execration. Two members of the
same species have recently, in an equally
accidental manner, brought about a dis
covery which will do something to remove
the stigma under which the family have
rested so long. A farmer driving along
the road near Kamloops, a station on the
main line of the Canadian Pacific Rail
road, within a day's journey from Van
couver, came across two bulls engaged in
what appeared to be a deadly struggle,
and as one of the beasts was his o trn prop
erty he made a successful attempt to sepa
rate them. In the course of their struggle
the bulls had dislÂ»dged several large
chunks of rock, which, being of a peculiar
appearance â spotted blue and black â
aroused the curiosity of the farmer, who
took some of it with him and afterward
submitted it to an assayer, with the re
sult Mint he found it contained copper to
the varue of $45 per ton. Subsequently
staking a claim and proceeding with the
development the lucky finder exposed a
large and well defined vein of ore, and now
the entire locality has been staked out.
MUST WAIT TO BE SHOT.
Muling of a Vancouver Justice in a Trial
for Murder.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 13.âAccord
ing to the ruling of Justice Drake, no one
is justified in shooting another in British
Columbia until the other has actually
drawn his gun. In a case of murder tried
here the deiense put m was that the dead
man was in the act of drawing his re
volver, having put his hand in bis hip
pocket for that purpose, the quickness of
the man charged being in all probability
the means of saving his own life. Judge
Drake says that such a plea on those
grounds might be recognized on the other
side of the line, but it is not law in this
country to shoot a man because he puts
his hand behind his back.
Acquitted of a Homicide.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 13.â T. A.
Sheehan, who shot Josh McKenzie in
Steveston last summer in a scuffle because
McKenzie, a desperate character of the

cabin occupied by Sheehan and precipi
tated a row, was acquitted by a jury to
day at the Vancouver fall ess;zeÂ«. the case
being considered one of justifiable homi
cide. The dispute arose over the fact that
both parties claimed to have rented the
cabin, but Sheehan was in possession.

John Dodge and His Wife
Are Taken to Ukiah
Prison.
Smith, Noble and Ferguson Are
Exonerated From the Caarge
of Complicity.
DRAFT PAYABLE TO MUDGETT
And Considerab c Money Found Upon
the Accnssd Is Not Satisfactorily
Explained.
CAHTO, Cal., Nov. 13.â At the conclu
sion of tbe preliminary hearing iv the
Mudgett case to-day the accused, John
D6dge and wife, were held to appear be
fore the Superior Court, and the prisoners
were taken separately to the Ukiah jail.
The evidence from the start tend.-d to
show no complicity on the part of Smith,
Noble, Ferguson and the parents of Dodge,
and all were accordingly exonerated.
Smith and Noble are identified ns the
two men upen whom suspicion in the first
instance was directed and for whom the
ofticers made such diligent search.
These men presented themselves at the
hearing voluntarily and were witnesses
for the defense.
The apparent desire of many of the wit
nesses for the pros cutiÂ«n to convict the
accused was a noticeable feature of the
proceedings and showed the pulse ol pub
lic favor was against them. The text of
the testimony, as shown on both sides,
seemed to be of a very flimsy character
and was remarkable for its indefiniteness.
The chief witnesses for the defense, Smith
and Noble, endeavored to account for the
draft payable to Mudgett and found in
Dodge's possession as having been paid to
him for work performed on the murdered
man's ranch.
Tbe handwriting of Mudgett being
strange, there was no positive identified.
tion of it being genuine. The money
found upon the persons of the prisoner
and wife was accounted for by the wife's
declaration that she had earned it in the
capacity of a domestic before she was mar
ried, and that only six months having
elapsed since their marriage she bad not
spent it all. Tbe reasons for their de
parture from the scene of the murder was
unsatisfactorily explained by a statement
from the accused that they were on their
way to visit the Noble iamily when ar
rested.
The witnesses for the prosecution were
all of a decidedly circumstantial nature,
consisting of many foreign facts that were
difficult to sustain as a complete chain of
evidence. The prosecution, however, hold
that the evidence of the larcre amount of
money and tbe Mudgett draft were not
clearly accounted for, and after a careful
review of the evidence the prisoners were
bound over to the higher conrt. The con
clusion of tbe hearing gives entire satis
faction to the citizens of this community.

Four different types of vessels, all (
named Oregon, are now in port. Three of
â¢ them are at anchor off S^usalito and the
fourth is tied up at Fremont Btreet. Off i
Saus-alito is the sloop Oregon, the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company's
"steamer Oresron nnd the United States
battle-ship Oregon. At Fremont-street
wharf is the old bark Oregon, built in
Bath, Me., in 1875. She has a cargo of
coal aboard and is still as stout and good
. a ship as tbe day she was launched.
The accompanying sketch was made
when the bark was passing in after a smart
â¢ run fr ni Nnnaimo, B. C, of seven days.
She brought coal for John Robenfeld'sSons,
Â«'. and Captain Parker dispensed with ttie
n id of a tug and sailed in. As she passed
the other three Oregons the old-timer
presented a pretty picture.
The men on shore leave on the battle
ship make thintis lively in Sau^alito.
Every day the boats are kept going in I
order to land the men who have been
granted liberty by the captain. Latter. y
the battle-sir. p has had steam up, and
sailing orders are expected at any time.
Theiunboat Bennington also got steam
vu I,'1 ,' yesteroay afternoon, and now all the
warships are ready ior action. The battle
ship will probably sail on a cruise, the
bark Oregon will return to the Sound for j
i.noihe- lead of coal, the steamer Oregon
will pro I ably not come out of retiienient
for six months and the sloop Oregon will I
not go into commission again until next

The British tramp steamer Grenada
played in hard luck during her last voy
* ate. While lying in Puget Sound
George W. McNear chartered her to carry
mi. eat to Europe at Â£16s3d per ton, the
i harter r.ariy to expire October 31. Cap
.i ii Ko.ff thought he would make ex-
Ven*e3 by bringing a load of coal to San
â¢ . ivancisco. He was delayed at the
bunker- and the vessel only got in yester
day. Fr.inhts in the meantime have
fallen to Â£1 Is 3.1. owing to the influx of
vessels, and McNear refuses to load the
. vessel. Captain Korff does not know what
to do in the circumstances, and the
-chances are that the Grenada will be laid
up again.
There is to be an exhibition night at the
Reliance Athletic Club next Tuesday
night, and the water front is very much
e'icited over the outcome of at least one of
the events. Everybody from the Mail
" dock to Meiggs wharf knows "Charley"
.<â  athcart, and be is to meet "Jimmy"
* Fox, the champion amateur of the Pacific
Coast, in a four-round contest. The men
have met before, and as there is an old
time grudge behind ttie affair the fighting
is sure to be fast and furious.
"Teddy" O>borne, late of London and
*' now of the Ferry lunchrooms, is training
Cathcart, and every day about 2 p. m. they
can be seen doing a little manual exercise
in tne gymnasium in the harbor police-

The schooner Scray docked at Berry
street yesterday. After discharging her
load of lumber she will go to the Fulton
Iron Works and be ntted out with engines
f r the Inter-Island Steam Navigation
Company. She is not as large a vessel as
. the James Spear vow being completed, but
nevertheless she will be a commodious
little vessel. The Spear is now almost
ready and the chances are that she will
sail for Honolulu in a few days.
T;ie American ship Shenandoah will

The tram i) steamer Ettrickdale docked
at Lomi aid-street wharf yesterday and
will at once begin discharging a large
: general cargo from Yokchama. There
was some talk along ihe front to tbe
effect that she was to lay a cable between
here and Honolulu as soon as she was
discharged. Goodall, Perkins & Co. have

that had a cable been made in the East of

A NATIONAL "SCOOP."
How II Seoolo Got Ahead ou the Presi
dential Election.
Ettorc Patnzi, one of the editors of
I'ltalia, was a short time ago appointed
Correspondent for this country of the
Secolo, which is in many respects the
leading newspaper in Italy. It is with
| satisfaction that Mr. Patrizi's San Fran
cisco friend* now learn that owing to a
"special" sent on election day the Secolo
"scoopea" its contemporaries on the elec
tion of McKinley.
The deep st interest was taken in the
election in Italy, and a strong desire was
manifested to see McKinley returned to
the White House. Commenting on the
result editorially I'Opinione of Rome says :
"The election ot McK'.nley is the triumph
i of good sense and national honesty," and
ritalia'oi Rome remarks: "Tbe cry of
Viva, McKinley!' should be uttered not
only in the United States but over all the
civilized world. 1 '
l'llalia of San Francisco has always Oeen i
one of the stancht-st champions of Me- '
Kinlej'. Just before the election the
paper was increased from four to eiphi I
(pages, and it is now one of the best made j
up as well as one of the must newsy and j
attractive journals in the City.
EMERGENCY HOME ALSO.
Mrs. John Pe.tee Desires to Es
tablish the Institu
t on.
New St' ps Being Tak^n to Bring Into
Existence tbe Proposed Emer
gency Hosp tal.
Mrs. John Pettee, who is working day
and night to raise the necessary money to
bring into existence an emergency hospi
tal and home in this City, will to-day de
posit in the Safe Deposit vaults the f ands
already accumulated. Mrs. Pettee dip
lomatically declined yesterday to say
what the amount already realiz- d is. She,
however, vigorously indicated that there
is much more hard work to. be done and
much more money must be had before the
charitable enterprise for which she has
ytood as sponsor can become an estab
lished fact. There will soon be another
entertainment, some time during the
present month, to raise funds for the
charity.
WhilfiMrs. Pettee was at the office of the
bociety for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children yesterday conferring, a woman
with three liitle children came in and
furnished an illustratinn. 4 The woman
is Marj* Julian, who lives at 9^ Houston
street and who has four chiidren. She is
about to be turned into the street because
is unable to pay her rent, which is
some months <verdue. Her Husband de
serted her some time ago, and since then,
with four little ones, tbe oldest being
under 6 years of ace and two being twins,
she has struggled vainly to support iier
self.
Her problem was what to do with her four
chiidren, the youngest being a baby of
18 months. Tnere was no place to which
they were entitled by right to go. She
could remain in her present lodgings only
two or three days more at the most. The
mother cried and the children wailed and
enlisted the sympathy of all who were
present. The Society lor the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children had no place to
which they could be sent. An appeal was
made to Secretary Kane of the Pjcific So
ciety, who, with officers of the Society fur
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, late
Yesterday was interesting himself in their
behalf.
Mrs. Pettee said that she saw in this case
alone the need of the proposed Emergency
Home in connection with tiie Emergency
Hospital. There are many cases of a sim
ilar sort of which the proper authorities
learn.
OTIS EXONERATED.
Judge Belcher In*trucred a Jury to
Acquit Him of Embezzlement.
Mrs. Annie McManus tried to create a
scene in Juiige Belcher's court yesterday
during tbe trial of Stephen Otis, charged
with embezzlement, but she was finally
suppressed and the bus ness of the court
was allowed to proceed in an orderly
manner.
Mr. Otis, who is a stockbroker, was ar
rested on the complaint of Mrs. McManus,
who declared that he had defrauded her of
mining stocks worth $1478. At the pre
liminary examination the committing
magistrate expressed doubt in regard to
the sufficiency of the proof, but Mr-. Mc-
Manus was so fluent of speech in recount
ing her alleged wrongs that she appeared
to overawe the court and the defendant
was neM for trial.
Alter hearing the testimony yesterday
Judge Belcher said it was c:ear that there
was no case against the accused, and in
structed the jury to acquit, which they
immediately did.
it was at this point that Mrs. McManus
sought to interrupt the proceedings. She
talked so rapidly that Official Stenog
rapher Maginis broke his pencil trying to
get every other word, but Bailiff Sullivan
finally stopped the flow of words, and tbe
defendant was declared to be exonerated
aud was discharged from custody.
After adjournment of court Mrs. Mc-
Manus denounced the court, the lawyers
and everybody connected with the case,
declaring that they were all in a conspir
acy to fleece her of ber property.

THE NEW CHARTER

Election.
CHARTER ASSOCIATION ACTS.
J mes D Phelan Will N me the Com
mittee and Act as the Per man. Nt
Chairman.
The Citizens' Charter Association last
evening adopted a series of resolutions at
a largely attended meeting in the hall of
the Academy of Siuences, the most im
unrtant of which provided that Mayor
elect Phelan. who acted as the chairman
of the meeting, should be requested to ap
point a- committee of 100 citizens, to repre
sent all interests in the community, in
the formulation of principles upon which
to build a new charter for San Francisco.
If the committee could not agree upon all
the fundamental propositions they should
prepare alternative propositions for sub
mission to the people.
Also, when the work of formulating the
principles of a charter should be suffi
ciently advanced the committee should
take the necessary steps fox the nomina
tion and election of a board of fifteen
Freeholders.
Mr. Phelan was named as the perma
nent chairman of tbe committee of one
hur.dred.
There was much discussion over a prop
osition ma.;e by A. P. Van Duzer to have
the committee of one hundred instructed
to make recommendations to the Legisla
ture at the next session for tbe amend
ment of the consolidation act for the pur
pose of strengthening the hands of the
incoming Mayor, but this was voted down.
Mr. Puelan spoke at some length, intro
ducing the business of the evening.
He said he was gratified at tbe unusu
ally large attendance, which indicated
that the people had not lost interest in the
proposition to have a new charter. He
supposed that many voters had over
looked the charter which was before tbe
public for adoption at the recent election.
He was forced to that conclusion by the
fact that only about half of the voters
cast their ballots either for or against it.
Tbe position which the measure had upon
the bal'ot was probably a disadvantage.
But for the mistake of placing it at the
head, before the candidates, it probably
would have been adopted.
The campaign of education in the char
ter matter had resulted in good, because
the attention of the public had been called
to the necessity for having a good munic
ipal government, which was, perhaps, as
important to the City as a good National
Government. The ground has been cleared
for charter-making by tbe amendment ol
the constitution brought about at the re
cent election. He did not think that, even
if the Board of E ection Commissioners
wf re entirely in favor of calling a special
election at th s time, it would be possible
to accomplish anything satisfactory in the
time intervening before the adjournment
of the Legislature. Tnere was not much
chance that a charter could be adopted
much before July, 1899. He concluded by
saying that with wtiat remained of the
consolidation act to work under he would
do what he could for tbe good government
of t c City and County.
Reports were then received from thÂ«
executive committee and :rom the joint
committee on watching the count. The
executive committee recapitulate i ihe
facts concerning the vote for ihe charter.
A part of their report was as follows:
Whatever may be the reasons, we must con
fess that it is a sad commentary upon the
average intelligence ol this communl y that
hall of its citiz -ns went to the poll- aud rekis
ti-red their votes upon innumerable officials
if hign and low degree, and yet lalled tore
cord their convictions udoh a fundamental
law tnttt might govern their City for pernaps
half a century.
The committee on watching the count
had this to report:
From reports received from Doth Captain
Morse ana our men we believe nothing more
serious than a few drunken quarrels and
trivial mistakes resulting from incouipetency
occurred in any of the booths. Notwithstnnd
ing the instructions of the Election Commis
sioners the "kitty" was iv evidence in many
E laces, and this, coupled witn' the lact that
roker. discounted the warrants of the officers
before the count was completed, was ihe < ause
of lhe drunkenness that prevailed, but which
hardly affected the general good work in most
of the precincts.
The finance committee reported that
tbe receipts were $6950, of which $5950
was contributed by citizens, $500 by the
Citizens' Non-Partisan committee and
$500 by tne Democratic State Central
Committee, and as the expenses were
$6781 78 there was a small balance on
hand after paying all expenses.
Messrs. Chase, Scott and Reynolds were
admitted as members of ihe Municipal
R form League.
Wiillam F. Dohrmann then spoke. He
saia that while only 25,000 citizens voted
for the charter, all good citizens would
help to support the hands of tne Mayor
elect in good government This had been
gainedâ that a man had been elected
Mayor in whom the people had confi
dence, an<i the City could not fail to make
progress. If any officers who had been
elected did not intend io serve the public
fait fui y it was a good time for them to
take warning. The time for boodling in
San Francisco had passed. He offered the
following for adoption:
Whereas, It is fully acknowledged that tbe
pre.-eiu system ol government in the City of
San irancisco is obsolete, defected and ua
suited to the requirements of a progressive I
city; and whereas, it is conceded that all citi
zens hnving at heart the welfare of San Fran
cisco are in iavor of a new organic law for
this metropolis; and whereas, the experience
of the recent charter campaign has shown
the necessity of further discussion and en
lightenment upon the fundamental principles
of municipal government; ami whereas, it is
highly important and desirable mat the repre
sentatives ol all interests in the community
should take part in discussing and formulat
ing the principles upon which nnother ne*
charter shall be framed ; therefore, be it
Reso ved, That the delegÃtes to the Charter
Association nud other citizens now assembled
request the president, of this meeting, the
Mayor-elect of San Francisco, to select and ap
point 100 citizens of this City to prepare a
new charter for San Francisco.
Resolved, Tha the president of this meeting
shall be the permanent chairman of this com
mittee, the members of which shall be spe
cially chosen so as to represent all classes in
the community, including those who sincerely
opposed as well as favored the recently pro
posed charter, the only condition being that
they shal. be in favor of civil service, munici
pal home rule and economical administration
in the government of San Francisco.
Resolved, That in case this committee of one
hundred citizens cannot fina.ly agree upon all
the fundamental principles of a new charter
for Ban Francisco alternate propositions upon
disputed points shall be prepared by them for
submission to the vote of the people.
Â£aolved. That when the work of formulat
ing tne principles of a new charter is suffi
ciently advanced they shall take the necessary
steps for the nomination and election of fifteen
Freeholders, in accordance with the constitu
tion of California, to legally draft a charter
upon the principles thus agreed upon, so as to
secure at the earliest possible moment the
ratification by the people of the charter thus
prepared and its jubsequeut approval by the
Legislature of the State.
After the resolutions had been read Mr.
Dohrmann spoke in support or tnem. He
said he believed they wonld open up the
subject ot charter making at least. Those
who favored good government would work
for a new charter and those who opposed
good government wonld work against a
new charter. In such a contest there
conld be no doubt as to who would win.
M. A. Rothchild moved the adoption
of the resolution?.
A. Thompson spoke in favor of the mo
tion. The plan proposed was in the direc
tion of popular government.
Mr. Phelan said that rather than in
terfere with Mr. Dohrmann's plan he
would accept theduties imposed upon nim
in the reso.ution, if the meeting so voted,
but he would suggest that a committee
of three could better select the proposed
committee of one hundred.
Rev. Dr. Scott said he favored the
if he could be assured that all classes of
citizens would have a fair show on the
committee. He believed that Mr. Phelan
could be relied upon to make the com
mittee fairly and fully representative.
A. P. Van Duzer moved to consider the
resolutions separately. This motion was
lost. M. A. Rothchild favored the resolu
tions.
Mr. Van Duzer moved the adoption of
the following, which was seconded by I.
J. Truman:
Resolved, That the committee of one hun
dred shall have the power to recommend to
the Legislature such legislation as will
strengthen the hands of the Mayor in the In
terest of better government.
Mr. Dohrmann opposed this on the
ground that this would pledge the mem
bers of the committee, some of whom are
opposed to giving the Mayor more power,
to ask fe Legislature to increase his
power. Moreover, the committee would
have all it could do to prepare a charter.
A long discussion followed, which re
sulted finally in tbe adoption of the reso
lutions submitted by Mr. Dohrmann and
the rejection of Mr. Van Duzer'a proposed
amendment.
On motion of E. A. Denicke the follow
ing committee was appointed to make
recommendations to the Legislature con
cerning thfi amendment of thi consolida
tion act: Dr. Taylor, A. Thompson. A. P.
Van Duzer, Henry N. Ciement and Mr.
Gooch.
Tbe meeting adjourned, subject to tbe
call of the chair.
PREPARING TO CONTEST.
Superintendent Ashworth Deter
mined Not to Give Up
His Ofice.
Supervisors Not Yet Prepared â A
Fight in the Twnty.Third Sena
â¢ torial District Certain.
Those among the members of tbe
present Board of Supervisors who are pre
paring to resist the efforts of the newly
elected board to take possession nave not
been able to get a full meeting as yet, but
all concerned appear to be willing to go
into the tight and a contest is certain to
take lilac.
SiJDervlsor Dimond said yesterday that
he had not been asked to sign '.he agree
ment to which others have affixed their
signatures pledging themselves to contest,
but had heard of the matter. He would
not say that he was not willing to go in.
"It will depend on circumstances," he
said, "but I certainly think that we have
as much right to hold over as some others
who are said to be preparing for war when
the newly elected officers demand their
key?."
The "circumstances" mentioned prob
ably refer to the action which Superin
tendent of Streets Asb worth is prep-.mng
to take regarding his office. He has been
advised thai his contention that be is a
county as well as a city official and en
titled to hold for four years is not tenable,
but it is known that he has consulted
with a prominent attorney and has in
structed to prepare papers for mandamus
proceeding?, provided any good grounds
for a legal fight can be found.
The result of the official count in the
Thirty-n:nth Assembly District, which
was finished yesterday, makes it certain
that there will be a contest, if not a re
count, in the Twenty-third Senatorial
District.
Those wno kept a snap tally in the in
terest of Tyrrell and Wi'lch, the defeated
candidates, declared that Tyrrell was
beaten by but ten votes instead of twenty,
as sbown by the unofficia count, while
Welch is only twenty votes behind
Tyrrell. This is cons dered too close to
Dass without some kind of a battle.

JUDGE WALLACE'S
SCORCHING WORDS
Mrs. Susie Martin Declared
to Be a Murderer if
Not Insane.
The Young Husband-Killer May
Yet Be Consigned to an
Asylum.
IS TIRED OF FARCICAL TRIALS.
One Court in Which It Is Not Con
sidered Exactly Polite for a Woman
to S; oot a Man.
Mrs. Susie B. Martin had an unpleasant
s.urprise in Judge Wallace's department
of the Superior Court yesterday morning,
for she expected to be set free, but instead
she was remanded to the custody of the
Sheriff with a prospect of commitment
to the State Insane Asylum as one of the
unpleasant contingencies of the near fu
ture.
Mrs. Martin was on Thursday acquitted
of a charge of murder by a jury in Judge
Wa lace's court, the verdict being in these
words:
! WE FIND THE DEFENDANT :
â¢ NOT UTJIL.TY. j
â¢ BY REASON OF HER â¢
*<* : INSANITY. â¢
It was admitted at the trial and in the
argument of counsel that Mrs. Martin
shot and killed her husband, John F.
Martin, several months ago while he was
talking with her in the Larkin-street cor
ridor of the new City Hall. ;
' The proof showed that Martin used
grossly insulting language to Jtiis wife in
the presence of straneers immediately be
fore the shooting, but this fact was not set
up as justification, the Supreme Court of
this State having decided, Judge Wallace
instructed the jury, that no words, how
ever grievous, shall be deemed a justifica
tion for even reducing | the verdict of a
jury from murder In the first degree when
the* killing is proved. .The defense, there
fore, was based entirely, on the theory that
the woman was insane when she fired the
fatal shot. <
Some testimony was presented to sub
stantiate this view, and it was accepted
by the jury, as shown by the verdict.
After tbe recording of the verdict and
the dismissal of the jury Judge Wallace
remandei tne defendant to the custody of
t: c Sheriff, ordering that she appear for
such further consideration of her case as
might seem proper under the provisions of
section 1167 of the Penal Code.
At the opening of court yesterday morn
ing Attorney Carroll Cook, representing
Mrs. Martin, arose and drew the attention
of the court to the fact that the prisoner
was present, and asked that she be dis
missed from cusiodv. He produced a cer
tificate from Dr. O'Brien, City Physician,
to the effect that Mrs. Martin is of sound
mind at ihe present time.
It was then that the unexpected hap
pened, for a eeneral impression had gone
abroad that Mrs. Martin would at once be
permitted to walk from the courtroom a
free woman. It at once became apparent
that Judge Wallace had no intention of
countenancing such a practice.
The Judge said that, according to his
understanding, if a defendant is acquitted
on the ground of insanity an exami
nation of the defendant ought to be had
before a jury to determine whether sucti
insanity is continuous and to ascertain
wi. ether the defendant is entitled to be
discharged.
Section 1167 of tbe Penal Code was then
read, as lollows:
If the jury render a verdict of acquittal on
the ground of insanity, me court may order a
jury 10 be summoned irom the jury list of the
county to inquire whether the defendant con
tinues to be insane. The court ma. cause the
same witnesses to be summoned who testified
ou the trial, and other witnesses, and direct
the Disir.ct Attorney to conduct ihe proceed
ings, a id counsel may app-ar for the defend
ant. The court may direct the Sheriff to take
the defendant and retain h.m in custody until
tne question of continuing insanity is de
termined. If the jury flud the d fenu.-mt
insane, he shall be committed by the bhenff to
the Stale Inane Asylum. If the jury find the
defendant sane, he shall be discharged.
Continuing in his remarks. Judge Wal
lace, with much earnestness, expressed his
opinion on tbe present pha;-e of the case.
"So far as I am concerned," said his
Honor, "I would like to have this matter
put in a proper light. Here is a person
who takes the life of another under such
circumstances that it is simple murder,
and the only defense is t at she is insane;
and the jury has listened to it. Now. if
she is insane, such a person as that ought
not to be at large; or if this is a mere
faree â if it has come to this that any
woman may take a pistol and shoot a man
down, and because she is a woman set up
a plea of insanity aud be acquitted â why,
let us know that.
"I am tir*d of sitting simply as a part of
a larc when the result can he told before
hand.
"People are brought here as witnesses
and jurors, and all the expenses of a pre
tended trial are incurred, ana it is no t.ial
at all
"Now, if this woman is not insane she
should have been convicted. If she is in
sane she should go to tbe asylum, for she
nngh shoot somebody else.
â¢ 4 I propose to hold her for regular pro
ceedings, and I want those witnesses
brought here, and such other witnesses as
may be necessary. I shall instruct the
District Attorney to proceed under secion
1167 of the Penal Code, and the Sheriff is
directed to take the deiendant into cus
tody until the question of her insanity is
settled."
Attorney Coolc was too much surprised
to make vigorous objection, but he at last
suggested that ho did not recall any testi
mony that would go to show the present
insanity of Mrs. Martin, and he did not
understand such proceedings to be neces
sary in the absence of anything to indi
cate continuing aberration on the part of <
the defendant.
Judge Wallace said he recalled some
testimony regarding the prisoner's acts
that tended to show aberration, such as
the wringing of her hands, hysteria, etc.-
At any rate he deemed it a matter to be
passed on by a jury in the regular way.
During the delivery of the court's opinion
Mrs. Martin evinced a lively interest in
tbe proceedings, the color in her face
coming and going as she began to com
prehend the possibility of a term of con
finement in a madhouse. It was apparent
from her manner that whatever may have
been her mental condition at the time she
killed her husband, she has at the present
time a clear understanding of the new
danger which apparently confronts her.
That it is only apparent, however, her
friends and herself with good cause be
lieve. Since her acquittal on Thursday
Mrs. Martin has regained much of her
normal mental condition, and it will no
doubt be an easy task for the jury to ascer
tain her complete restoration to sanity by
next Tuesday.
After consultation between the attorneys
it was agreed that the venire for the jury
should be made returnable for next Tues
day morning, at which time the question
of Mrs. Martin's sanity or insanity will be
decided. Mr. Cook asked that the pris
oner be admitted to bail, but this was re
fused by Judge Wallace.
District Attorney Barnes informed a
Call reporter that he will be present at
tiie lime appointed with proper witnesses
to make a thorough examination into the
matter presented under Judge Wallace's
ruling.
AT THE DANCING CLASS

I second meeting of this season at Lunt's
Hall last evening. The meetings of the
| Fortnightly have come to be the most
: joyfully anticipated of all the swell func
tions, and invitations for the affairs are
eagerly solicited.
The simplicity, early hours and pleasant
informality that marked the first meeting
were not wanting at the dance of last
eveniug.
Two charming debutantes â Miss Helen
Hopkins and Miss Caro Crockettâ were
added to the already large dancing list.
Milton Latham and Robert Eyre led the
cotillon and in the first set were: Miss

MARCfIiM THROUGH GEORGIA
Interesting ; Experiment in Practical
Soldiering by the Macon Militia.
SOMETHING TO SUPERSEDE THH
-.'HOT-HOUSE STYLIi OF MILI-
TARY EDUCATION.
No doubt militia training in most States
might be improved, and Captains J. E. P.
Stevens and P. G. K. Bell, respectively of
the Macon Hussars and the Macon Light
Infantry, have a simple and practical
scheme for doing it. Togo by boat or
train to a summer camp and enjoy a jolly
junket or picnic for a few weeks is not, in
the opinion of these officers, the way to
manufacture the hard, tough kind of sol-
diers wanted in actual campaigning.
Hence the recent trials at Griffin, 1 Ga.
Two companies were marched over rough,
hilly country, under a hot Southern sun,
to camp as they might in war time.
They were the average, lot of city men â
from banks, .l.i w offices, stores, shops,
etc. â the same as comi the majority of
the volunteer companies of the country at
large.
In his report of the . march Dr. H. J.
"Williams, the regimental surgeon, says:
"1 cannot but express my enthusiasm,
over the success of the expedition. At
first I feared the men would not be able
to withstand the hardships of such a
march in the hot month of June, but
Captains BU and Stevens had studied the
subject and thought differently. Of the
titty-three men â merchants, clerks,! stu-
dents, etc.â four were young men whose
occupations seemingly unfitted them for
t the effort, but they actually came into
camp in better condition than those .who
came by rail. While there were cases of
illness in camp among those who came by
rail there was not a case among those who
marched. The distance covered waa
about fifty-four miles.
"There is one point of a purely medical
character on which I wish to comment,
namely, the use of Vino Kolafra (prepared
by the Brunswick l*harmacal Co., 92 Wil-
liam street. New York), which had been
furnished to the companies and was em-
ployed during the march. After march-
ing two hours the men were halted and
two ounces of Vino Kolafra ministered
to each man. Then the march was re-
sumed.
"In a few moments all sense of fatigue
and discomfort passed away, the step was
brisk and the men full of life. The circu-
lation quieted down and the respiration
became steady.',' >
This preparation bad been tested by
I Captains Stevens and Bell for severai
weeks prior to the march, in order to
satisfy themselves that it had no deleteri-
ous .or reactive , effect. Captain Stevens
says: ''In the recent practice "march by
my company, the Macon Light infantry,
and the Macon Hussars, both of the
Georgia Volunteers, Vino Kolafra was
used: with very beneficial results. The -
men were clerks, etc., not possessing ; the
stamina to stand much fatigue, yet; thanks
to Vino Kolafra, the march was accom-
plished with very: little discomfort or
weariness. I feel assured that by its use
the intense exhaustion so often following
such labor will be entirely done away
with." =-.â¢â ?;. ;
Captain Bell gives the same account of
the marc and remarks that no reaction
whatever could ; be perceived from the use
of Vino Kolafra.
: The above facts suggest that physicians
might, with the aid of Vino Kolafr:i, place
under marching orders all that class of
persons who suffer from lack of exercise â
who are too fat or too weak to get the good
out of active muscles. : The wholesome
stimulus of Vino Kolafra would put these
folk in motion and show what an excellent
thing is life on legs. The medical journals
recommend it for nervous," fidcety people,
and all who suffer from irregular heart or
disordered nerves. It is the tonic par ex-
cellence in convalescence.

FIGHTING THE AIR
General Harrison's address to the
Farmers' National Congress is chiefly
notable for the advice which he gave to
those who are not satisfied with the ex
isting condition of American legislation.
It was an appeal to cpmmon-sense against
the folly of idle discontent, and pointed
out clearly the difference between mere
agitation and the true methods of effect
ing reform.
"I have no patience," said General
Harrison, "with those people who are
always fighting the air. It is mischievous
to denounce classes and this thing and
that. If there are trusts let us know it
and bring leeis!ation to bear upon them
and court decrees to prevent them, and
then we have accomplished something."
The ex- President went on to declare that
if any man would make it plain to the
American people that he is oppressed and
that he is not getting his rights the
majority of the people would be on his
side against whoever or whatever opposed
him. The one thing for the reformer to
do is to point out the specific wrong that
is done. Nothing can be gained by wild
declamations in vague terms against
plutocrats and corporations in general.
Everything on tbe other hand can
be effected by the common - sense
way of selecting some well-defined
wrong, devising the proper reme/iy
for it, and then appealing to the
patriotism of the people to apply tbe
remedy through the recognized forms of
American law.
The address of the ex- President was in
every respect timely. We have had dur
ing the whole period of the Democratic
depression too much of that form of agita
tion which General Harrison so well de
scribed as "fighting the air.' While tne
conservative common-sense of the country
sought for the cause of the evil and dis
covered it in the breaking down of the
protective system a whole host of unrea
soning and clamorous men were shouting
for a total revolution in our financial, in
dustrial and social organization.
The common-sense of the people pre
vailed in the election, and no great harm
has come from the agitation. Neverthe
less, some injury always results from such
clamors. They stir up strife between
classes and sections, create misunder
standings between labor and capital and
not infrequently Mead. to acts of violence
which have to be severely punished.
There is certainly no reason why any of
this fighting the air should be engaged in
by the farmers of this country. They have
suffered severely from tho Democratic
tariff, it is true, but that suffering will
soon be ended. The people have
learned now that the interests of all
classes are one and that the patriotism
and common-sense of the majority can
always be counted on" to discover what is
wrong in legislation and to apply the
proper remedy. Therefore, all can accept
the motto which tbe ex-President gave to
the audience he was addressing: "The
city for the country and the country for
the city, and all for the flag."
SHIPS IN THE BAY.
The sketch published in The Call yes
terday giving a view of the northern por
tion of the bay and snowing a fleet of
merchant vessels must have been in the
highest degree gratifying to the people of
the City. It was such a picture as ou^ht
to be seen in our bay every day in the
year. It had about it a look of commer
cial activity and was as pleasing to the
money-making instinct as to the artistic
taste.
According to old 'residents, never since
the days of ' 49 has the harbor been so
thronged with vessels as at nresent. Al
most all classes of shipping are repre
sented among the vessels which now
adorn the quiet waters waiting for cargoes
of merchandise to be carried to all quar
ters of the earth. It is, indeed, a goodly
sight and full of promise for the future.
It is to ships that California must look
for her greatest prosperity. Our best mar
kets when we reach anything like a full
development will be found beyond the
seas. We can hardly ever compete in
manufactures in tbe East, where they
have not only larger capital, but cheaper
labor and cheaper transportation. What
we manufacture except in the few rare
cases of products which are peculiar to
our forest*, mines and orchards, must
sees for customers in South America. Aus
tralia, the Orient, and the thousand
islands of the Pacific.
The ships in the harbor to-day there
fore are not so much a fulfillment as a
promise of greater things to come. We
owe the present influx of vessels mainly
to the demand for wheat. That demand
oi course we cannot count on every year,
but if we could build up a trade in manu
factured goods, in such articles as are
needed for the West and the South, we
could count upon a commerce permanent,
enduring and continuously profitable.
With the revival of industry in the
Australia, the advancing civilization in
the Orient and the improving conditions
in the South American Btates, it seems
reasonable to believe that by rightly ap
plied energy, the careful study of these
markets, it wonld be comparatively easy
for us to make California a manufacturing
center for a large portion of Pacific Coast
peoples, and San Francisco the great me
tropolis of tbe greatest of tbe oceans of
earth. The ajght that is now to be seen
in tbe harbor would then be counted as
an every-day occurrence, and while it
wonld still delk'ht the artistic sense of our
people, it would no longer be thought a
commercial boom.
THE DINGLEY BILL.
The discussion in the third day's ses
sion of the Farmers' National Congress at
Indianapolis on the suoject of a memorial
to Congress served to bring out very
clearly the unsatisfactory nature of the
Dingley bill. This will be sure to have
some effect in determining whether or no
we are to have an extra session of Con
gress. It seems clear that all that can be
hoped for this winter would be the pas
sage of that bill, and if it could not be
amended so as to make it suitable to the
needs of American industry, then an
extra session will be almost imperative.
The debate at Indianapolis was brought
about by a motion to eruce out from the
memorial to Congress the paragraph ask
ing for a duty upon wool. This rrotion
led to a general debate upon tne subject
of protective duties, in the course of
which the Dingley bill necessarily be
came the object of particular considera
tion. The charge was made that the bill
discriminates in favor of the manufac
turer and against the wool-grower, and
this view seems to have been taken by the
convention in the memorial which it
adopted.
It will be remembered that the bill re
ported to the House by Mr. Dingley was
on its face a compromise measure. It was
well known to the framers of the bill that
a thoroughly protective system would not
be accepted by the Senate. It was hoped,
however, that the bill presented would
find favor with that body, inasmuch as it
aimed to raise a revenue adequate to the
expenditures ot the Government without
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1896.
radicall)' altering the existing Wilson
tariff.
The bill provides generally that existing
duties shall be increased by 15 per cent.
Where such an increase would raise the
rate of duty nbove that imposed by the
McKinley tariff, then the McKinley rates
Bball be accepted. There are some few
exceptions to this general rule. The duty
on sugar was not touched. Wool was
taken off the free list and duties imposed
equal to about 60 percent of the McKinley
tariff. Lumber was treated in the same
way as wool. These constitute the salient
features of the bill.
It will be seen that the measure wan in
tended merely as a makeshift, and it is
easy to understand why the farmers' con
vention was not satisfied with it. It would
indeed be desirable to have it enacted
tliis winter so as to provide the Govern
ment with the necessary revenues until a
comprehensive protective measure could
be adopted. Its acceptance, however,
should not stand in the way of an extra
session. The industries ot the country re
quire protection arranged on true scien
tific principles, and the people will be
satisfied with nothing less.
AMERICA AND EUROPE
From the ione of the European press, as
reported by dispatches, it is evident that
the British acceptance of American ar
bitratiqn in the Venezuelan controversy
is not #0 favorably received in Eurppe as
it has been with vÂ«. Leading jdurnals in
France and Germany have expressed the
belief that England has gone too far in
recognizing the validity of tbe Monroe
doctrine, and that Europe has sufferad
some injury to her prestige by reason of it.
Some of these journals clearly mistake
the scope and meaning of the Monroe doc
trine. They construe it as a declaration
of the absolute supremacy of the United
States over all this hemisphere, and of her
right to interfere In all possible quarrels
that may arise between any American and
any European state. This construction of
the doctrine may be an honest mistake in
some cases, but more likely it bus been
j)Ut forward by the French and German
press for the purpose of discrediting it and
arousing the antagonism of their people
against it.
It matters very little, however, what
construction they may put upon it, so
long as their objections to it are confined
to mere criticisms on the part of the press
and do not take the form of any diplo
matic protest. The claim of the United
States in the matter is founded on justice,
and has never worked wrong to any power.
It is no more than a declaration of our
intention and our right to prevent any
European nation from extending its
dominion in this hemisphere. This inten
tion carries' with it no threat of war, except
in cases where the aggressor refuses to
submit to a fair arbitration of the ques
tions at issue.
The British Government has lost no
prestige and made no sacrifice of pride in
agreeing to the arbitration of the Vene
zuelan boundary. European critics who
do not like England will, of course, en
deavor to represent her acknowledgment
of our right to interfere as a surrender of
some British interest or right. It will not
be so understood, however, by any large
number of the peoples of either of the two
countries which have been parties to the
controversy.
What England haa done has simply
been to recognize an existing fact. The
Monroe doctrine became law just as soon
as the United States became powerful
enough to mace it law, and it goes with
out saying that if any European nation
should find itself engaged with us in a
controversy similar to that which has just
been so happily settled it would soon fol
low the example of England and acknowl
edge the validity of the doctrine set up by
James Monroe and ever since maintained
inviolate by tho Governme nt of this
country. ____^________
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
To-morrow's Call will contain, as one
of its delightful features, the words and
music of the most catchy of sonps from
the new opera, "Fleur de Lis," which will
be rendered next week at the Baldwin.
The sone is the favorite of Delia Kox,
who has scored an immense success with
it. It is entitled, "Take Me to Your
Heart, Father." Everybody will be
whistling or humming the air. It is
bound to capture the town.
The music alone could not be obtained
in the stores for less than 30 cents, but the
piece cornDlete is presented to the readers
of The Call, along with many fine liier
ary features, for just the price of the
paper. The Suxday Call will publish
the piece exclusively, and copies of the
paper should be ordered early, so that no
body may be disappointed.
The Chit Chat Club of San Francisco is
an organization of brilliant and brainy
men who meet annually and enjoy a gas
tronomical feast, along with a choice
literary Danquet. This year's e3says will
appear exclusively in The Sunday Call.
The authors are: The eminent lawyer,
Hon. D. M. Delmas; Horace G. Platt,
president of the Art Association; Pro
fessor Gustav E sen of the Academy of
Sciences and Professor Bernard Moses of
the University of California. Their papers
will bo found excellent, instructive and
entertaining reading.
"A New and Startling Phase of a Great
Question" is given a prominence that its
importance demands. The facts set forth
under this head appeal to the deepest in
terest of tne California reader, and par
ticularly to residents of this metropolis.
The matter is entirely new and fresh, so
far as newspaper consideration is con
cerned, and it may be safely assumed that
very few people have given the subject
careful thought. The writer of the article
has inlused humor of a healthful kind
into tin- details of his subject. The Call's
able and original cartoonists may have
overdrawn the situation somewnat, but
their efforts will, nevertheless, be found
worthy of commendation.
On the well-known fact that Thb Call'b
telegraphic service is unexcelled in the
West, ana that its news department is
the best and most reliable on tbe slope,
there is no need to dwell. Suffice it to
say that California's representative Sun
day newspaper is The Call.
A tramp applied at a Connecticut farm
house for something to eat and the farm
ei's wife gave him a piece of pie, where
upon he smote her upon the bead. On that
showing the Providence Journal, while not
justifying the tramp, contends he had se
rious provocation and his act was a whole
some protest against the use of pie â an
opinion which goes far to make it clear
why the Connecticut pie-eater is not
always pleased with the judgments of
Providence.
Boston claims a reformer who can prove
that a full-grown man can live and keep
fat on food that costs only 87 cents a week,
but perhaps tne Boston ideas of life and
fatness sue different irom those that pre
vail in tne Golden West.
There is no use waiting for prosperity
any longer. This is the time to get in ana
work for it.

SHE LON ROLS VOTES
A Colored Woman v.ho Runs Her Election
District.
As happy a woman as there was in New York
on election night, after the returns began to
come in foi McKinley, v.-as Mrs. Mary L. Hall.
She Is colored; she lives In West Twenty
seventh street, and for years she has been a
power in the Twenty-fifth Assembly District,
says the Sun. Men come and go and vote at
her bidding. For weeks before an election she
holds political meetings in the front room of
the basement, where sne lives. She canvasses
from house to house, distributes literature, or
ganizes clubs and makes speeches. Her annual
parade is a feature of the campaign. She is a
watcher at the polls. She knows every man in
her election district, besides many public men.
She is wise in the ways of practical politics.
Miss Bos well, who did such effective work this
year, says that most of what she knows about
political methods she has learned from Mrs.
Hall.
The parade was rather late this year. It oc
curred on the Friday evening before election,
previous to a meeting of colored people at v
hall on Madison avenue. As usual Mrs. Hall
marched at tne head of her followers. On her
head whs a white linen cap, which bore this
label across the front:
The Only Party for Me, â¢
<^. O. P.
Across her right shoulder and tied under her
left arm she wore a purple sash, and with her
hair hanging on her shoulders and brandish
ing a sword in her right hand she strode, like
a modern Joan of Arc, at the head of her men.
At either side of her inarched a lieutenant,
the one to the right bearing a picture of her
hero, Abraham Lincoln, and the one to the
left a standard with two devices. On one side
it showed these words, "As She Wishes So We
Vote," on the other side this exhortation,
â¢'Make Your Mark Under the Eagle."
On election day she had in her front yard a
large picture decorated with the National
colors. It was a campaign poster showing Mc-
Kinley and prosperity over against Bryan and
poverty. The basement windows were adorred
with flags Hnd ltthogrHphs. The room within
was decorated with flags and banners and
pictures of McKinley, Kobart, Harrison and
Blame. There Mrs. Hall was found, weary,
but radiant, surrounded by friends and mem
bers of the Women's Republican Association.
"I'm older than I look," she said' "though i
don't look as well as usual to-day. I haven't
been to bed since night before last. I never go
to bed election eve. I stood out there in the
street explaining that picture to the people all
night, and telling them what their duty was.
"I've been in politics ever since 1868. You
see I was born a slave. But when tne war
broke out I ran away Irom Atlanta and joined
the Union army in Tennessee. I never was
abused by my owner. I just wanted to be free.
I didn't want to call q^iy one muster or mis
tress. The/c were eight of us who made our

escape together to the army. I was the young
est of them and couldn't stand the fatigue of
the march, so they put me into the ainoular.ee
corps. There I learned to nurse and I went
witn the array from Atlanta to the sea. Then
I was transferred to a marine hospital in South
Carolina, where I stayed until the end of the
war. After that I came to New York."
"How did you happen to get into politics?"
â¢'1 was interested in my people. Few of
them could read, and yet they had the right
to vote. I could read, and so I began to in
struct them. I explained the issues of the
campaign to them. 1 took them to register
and I took them to vote. I have lived right
here in this same district for twenty-three
years. But still I've never made friends, ex
cept in business."
"Do you know what has given you most in
fluence with your people?"
"Well, I'll tell you. My work has been
with the men. Now, I've always made it a
point, if I make n promise, to keep it. If I
find that I can't keep ray word, I call them
all together and say, 'Now, boys, Im sorry,
but I can't do what I said I would,' and then
I carefully explain to them the difficulty.
Why, I've twenty white men in my club.''
Here she pointed proudly to a big blue
banner on one side of the room, on which was
printed in golden letters:
The Mart L. Hall â¢
â¢ STALWART REPUBLICAN CLUB
â¢ OP the
i TWENTY-FIFTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. â 
"I have about 150 women and 350 men in
that club." she continued. "Lately, I've just
organized a Young Giria' Juvenile Republican
Club. It is composed of twenty-rJve girls from
12 to 14 years of age. They are to distiibnte
literature for me in the next :our years. They
are more faithful than the women. Colored
women wi.i not work unless I pay them; and
then colored men don't want their wives to go
into politics. My busband is a white man and
he doesn't care."
â¢'How many men do you influence?"
"Well, in this one election district I control
125 votes. I am the only woman I know of
who works in - primaries. I am an anti

THEY DEMAND A
SEWER SYSTEM
Improvement Clubs Uniting
on a Popular Pro
ject.
From Ocean View to Holly Park,
Immediate Relief Is
Wanted.
THE DISTRICTS ARE SURVEYED
Instead of Blind Sewers There Will
Be a Main Drain to the
Bay.
A movement which gives promise of as
suming very large proportions before the
Board of Supervisors-elect will have taken
their seats has just been started in the
district lying between Bernal Heights and
Ocean View.
That portion of San Francisco is being
steadily settled by people of moderate
means, and the various tracts of land in
cluded within its boundaries are now
dotted with homes. And yet it has no
system of sewers. In fact it has no pro
vision for draining the numerous little
sewers scattered about the slopes and val
leys â a fact which has compelled the
property-owners and improvement clubs
interested to band themselves together for
a fight for immediate relief.
From time to time representatives^^
various tracts or homesteads have aoplied
to the Board of Supervisors for local
sewers. In the ordinary routine of City
business these petitions were granted.
The result is that short bits of streets and
small tracts have been provided with pipe
sewers. These were laid to certain points,
such as Mission street or San Jose road,
and there at the lowest levels the pipes
end against the solid earth. In other
places the pipes were carried to some bill
aide and left open without any outlet other
than a neighbor's lot. Such a condition
as this did not attract special attention
until the districts affected began to fill
with dwellings, but then the residents saw
that relief was absolutely necessary.
Tde Holly Park Improvement Club took
the first steps toward correcting the evil
which is said to menace the health of the
neighborhood. At a meeting held about
two weeks ago the executive committee of
this club decided to secure the services of
a civil engineer to investigate the whole
question and give advice on what would
be tne best plan qf carrying out the de
sired end â that of establishing a compre
hensive Bewer system and constructing a
main outlet sewer capable of draining the
whole district. The important work of
examination was given to M. M. O'Shaugh
nessy, C. E., who has since made a survey
of the territory in question and prepared
a report based upon the result of his in
vestigation.
At a meeting of the club to-night Mr.
O'Shaughnessy will be present and submit
his report with recommendations as to
what should be done to drain the district.
"They have built a sewer on Mission
street,"' he said, "but it has no outlet, and
they are now building a sewer on San Jose
road, or Chenery street, which has no out
let provided for. The sewers are there
discharging into private property, and
some of them are banked up and simply
have no outlet whatever, so the sewage
either flows over the ground or stays in
the pipes. The sewers were built by street
contractors under order of the Supervi
sors, but the trouble is only small sections
were done at one time.
"The Holly Park Improvement Club
has started to get the matter corrected
and to get a plan for a general sewer sys
tem. I have gone over the ground for the
club and made a preliminary survey of
the land. As a result of my investigation,
I will say that a sewer four and a half
miles is needed from Ocean View, begin
ning at or near the railway crossing there
and following the line of Islais Creek to
the bay of San Francisco.
"A good deal of private property will
have to be condemned for nearly a mile
ami a half along the creek line* for this
main sewer, which should end beyond
Kentucky street in tne bay. If the club
can get it built even to Islais Creek chan
nel that would be good enough for the
present.
"The line I have selected is along Wyo
ming avenue, from Sickles avenue, Ocean
View, then along Cayuga avenue ana oh
through private property to Islais street,
and again through private property to
Channel street, from which point it would
be extended by the most available route
to the water.
"The territory lo be drained by this
sewer contains about 3000 acres and takes
in Fairmount, Castro Heights, Sunny
side, Stanford Heigbts, Ocean View, West
End maps. Excelsior Homestead and the
district adjacent to old Si. Mary's College.
"All the improvement clubs of these
districts are ready to unite and form a
central committee or association of clubs
to carry the project into execution."

Slide, Calaveras County, Cal. "The Battle of
the Kegs" Is the title of a mock heroic poem
written by Francis Hopkinson, a patriot, on
an incident of the Revolutionary War. Kegs
filled with gunpowder were floated down the
Schnylkill with a view to destroying the Brit
ish fleet anchored in the vicinity of Phila
delphla. The danger of ' the "infernal ma
chines" : was discovered before any ;â  damage
was done, and alter that the British, small
arms and cannon were discharged at every
thing that came ' floating down the river. A
number of empty ketrs were sent down the
stream, and the firing upon them gave rise to
the poem. : â â¢-, â¢ â â¢ â ' â

President and Vice-Presidentâ a. R., City.
As the President and the Vice-President of the
United States are not voted for directly by the
people, but are chosen by electors, it is not
likely that the electors of the dominant party
would vote for one man of their party for
President and for the candidate of the other
party for Vice-President. They could do so, but
if they so betrayed their party it might tot be
pleasant for them to return to 'their constitu
ents. If, however, such a thing should be done
the two men elected would serve.
Old Stampâ Carolina, City. The stamp

WRECKERS OF THE PEOPLE'S PARTY.
Buckley ism Reared Its Ugly Head â Treachery to Principle
and Intrigue Among Populists.
This will be an instructive story to the general public and an interesting though
distasteful recital to the fifty thousand Populists of California. Honorable men suffer
because of the universal distrust created by the repeated acts of dishonor perpetrated
in the name of reform by so-called reformers, but the betrayal of principle and con
fidence has become so common that it is expected.
Nothing in the line of political intrigue and disgrac ful jobbery, however, has
elicited quite so much astonishment in the State for many years as the late Buckley-
Popnlist alliance in San Francisco. How pitiable must be the discouragement of the
farmers and country merchants who have borne the taunts and jeers of unapprecia
tive neighbors for years for principle! How disheartened must they have been, and
how indignant, to have learned that trusted leaders had fallen down before the "blind
white devil" of San Francisco!
The inside history of the deal between Buckley and the "conference committee"
of the People's party is yet to be told. Heretofore about all that is known is that a
combination was made between a party which had stood for better conditions and
purer politics and one of the most disreputable elements of bossism. All bossism is
disreputable in the eyes of thoughtful, patriotic men.
The full report of the bargains and promises entered into at Buckley's Ellis-street
resort would be still more interesting to those who have thought they had built up a
true reform party than this recital of the surface indications of duplicity. The pro
fessions of conversion to Populism, voiced for Buckley by those who sought to make
the People's party his stepping-stone to power, are grotesquely amusing, yet pathetic.
Such facts as are generally known to the delegates of the late Populist Municipal Con
vention and the candidates might better be buried in the dead past it useful lessons
could not be drawn from a frank exposure of the loose n.ethods which make such
things possible as the surrender of party and principles to increase the influence of a
disreputable political boss.
The first mistake was the passage of a rule by the County Committee permitting
the delegation of any Assembly District to be filied to its full quota by those who
represented such district. Under this rule and, as many think, with the connivance
of one or two of the County Committee, between thirty and forty Buckleyites became
regular delegates to the convention.
The fatal blunder after the formation of the convention was the departure from
the Populist principle that the rant and file of all organizations (as well as of the
Nation) shall voice its sentiments and judgment in all matters of importance. The
first motion made was that the chairman should select a "committee on conference."
Many of the pioneers of the movement and well-intending portion of the convention,
fearing the election of untried material from among the numerous strange faces in the
delegates' seats, voted together to place the chairman's judgment above the judgment
of the whole convention. They would not trust themselves. The result of the vote
upon this matter was apparently arranged beforehand, as the secretary in an under
tone confidently assured a fellow-member, "You will see the motion will pass all
right." It aid pass. The chairman gracefully asked time for consideration of the re
sponsibility, the committee was appointed and the deal with Buckley began.
After adjourning from time to time for a week or ten days to permit the confer
ence committee to consult with Buckley, Phelan and the Rainey Democracy, the
announcement was made that we were ready for business. Nominations were
reached and Buckley's ticket complete was placed before the convention, with only a
few others from among the recognized Populists. The majority of the convention
sat dumfounded, mute and sullen as Diruond, and Fahey. and Eaton, and Malloye,
and Todd and all the rest of the Buckley nominees were one afier the otb^r intro
duced with clock-like precision as the respective offices were announced. Sunday
evening, between the regular meetings, a conference of many of those who had sus
tained the party for tweo'ears or more was called at Dr. Griswold's office. It resulted
in stiffening the opposition to Buckley. At the succeeding meetings every oppor
tunity which was presented for a f>qnare, clear-cut issue between a Buckley nominee
for Supervisors and an avowed Populist was used to rally the Populist forces against
the political boss, and in all but two instiinces Buckley's lambs met with defeat. In
the Sicond, Fourth and Filth warrts^ where thee was no available candidate, the
Democratic Business ilen's nomination was indorsed. With having secured what
seemed to be the control of the most important nominations, the convention was
apparently Batisfied, and little or no opposition developed to the rest of the Buckley
slate.
In the last hour of the convention, just before adjournment sine die, the secretary
moved that the campaign committee be given "plenary powers." This was sup
ported by the prominent member of tlie conference committee who is said to have
"hypnotized Buckley." These gentlemen pleaded for more confidence. Their
oratory in their own behalf would have done credit to a Republican
stumper who views "the business depression. as "only a lack of confidence."
Evidently the convention realised that it was about time it should asser:
its claims to sanity, and amid a storm of noes the confidence game was killed.
But the resignation of Dr. C. D. Cleveland, who had been nominated for Supervisor,
helped the movement toward the "alliance" with Buckley. The doctor resigned be
cause he would not, by direction or indirection, be associated with the boss he had
helped to stigmatize as a criminal. The dector was a member of the Wallace Grand
Jury a lew years ago. He resigned the nomination after the convention adjourned
because he would not be affiliated with Buckleyism. The campaign committee dis
played its willingness to be slaughtered for a whole sheep and placed the boss' man
upon the ticket in his stead. . ,
The heaviest blow struct at the ''confidence game" during the convention-was the
nomination of Fred W. Potter for Supervisor of the Sixth Ward. Young Potter is a
clean, square but humble proprietor of a machine-shop. His open, frank and honest
face and square build won him the nomination when he appeared before the conven
tion. He defeated the treasurer of the telephone company. At no moment during
the convention was there such a scurrying about acd such a mad crowd as at that
time when the vote was polled for the Sixth Ward Supervisor. These men. however,
who hypnotize Buckley, and others who attend to the Sprine Valley's business, and
others who were playing for Buckley's favor, directed a series of annoyances, intimida
tions and misrepresentations against Potter's candidacy af ier the convention ad
journed, and made the matter so bothersome to him that the young man resigned
The treasurer of the telephone company was immediately placed upon the ticket. This
persecution of Potter in the interest of an officer of one of the monopolies was followed
with a vi or worthy a better cause.
Populists who are verdant believe in direct legislation. Cranks talk about the '
j rights of the people to compel their public servants to act or to decide authoritatively j
j upon vital measures, as Populists and Socialists offer this as a cure for the abuse and
i betrayal of authority by representatives. That is all very well for men to argue about â¢
j it reads very logical when treated by "the man who hypnotized Buckley," but it seems !
lit is not to be applied when it Interferes with his own chances for election. In this j
connection it would be amusing to tell of some of the sudden conversions to Populism
vouched for by the enthusiastic members of the conference committee, who swallowed
Buckley's nominees without a grimace. It would be likewise in order to learn what
! excuses they can offer for assuming that the smaller body (the campaign committee)
| was justified in undoing the work of the larger body (the convention itself). Repre
sentatives who violate their pledge 8 sometimes present some plausible excuse. Men
who as public servants sell out to corporations ignore the rignts and sentiments of
those who place them in power. The active persecutors of young man Potter and the
j hypnotizer and all who still thought that it was "good, practical politics" to deal
I with Buckley, have been branded indelibly by their willingness to enter into cotubi
: nations with disreputable and unreliable elements and to violate the sealed principles
of their party for success.
The psychical force exerted upon the wavering by the boss would do credit to
Kennedy. Where it will impress a candidate or follower favorably he is Informed
"that the railroad company is behind the deal." Another 13 told that the Catholic
church is backing up the combination. "Both ends are played against the middle."
The result is the same to the boss whichever side wins. He has cultivated both sides
Not until the day of election or after the votes are counted does it dawn upon the un
successful that they have been playing a confidence game wherein they supplied the
confidence and the bosses divided the game. These rumors about powerful support
are the stock in trade of the political bosses and so industriously were such tales cir
culated that the unsophisticated Populists, on the conference committee and off it
were very beautifully taken in.
According to the returns Buckley's strength did not amount to 1000 votes. The
stealing of the credit for the opposition to the charter counted perhaps 1000 or 1500
votes for his candidates, and yet they averaged, with People's parly indorsement but
3500. The Populist vote was decreased by the odium the alliance with Buckley' cast
upon the ticket. Doubtless the work which the manipulators thought was so clever
disgusted more than enough voters in toe State to place it within the Republican
column. One thing is certain, Buckley is repudiated. His late allies will be chagrined

ceive a salary of $15,000 a year and ex
penses. His employers are the world
famous Exploration Company of London,
England.
The Exploration Company of London is
the largest and richest mining concern in
the world and it is yearly becoming
richer. It is backed by the Rothschilds,
who have invested during the last year la
mines in America alone $50,000,000. Their
purchases on this side of the Atlantic in
clude the Anaconda (Montana) copper
mines, for which they paid $34,000,000;
the Homestead mines in the Black Hills;
extensive properties in New Mexico and
Sonora, Mex. ; in Southern Oregon; the
Oneida mine in Amador County; the
Tom Boy mine of Telluride, Colo., and
they are considering an offer Sto
purchase the Mariposa Grant of 44,000
acres in the heart of Mariposa County.
The company ov/ns mines in Africa, Aus
tralia, Russia and almost every part of
the world. The mines are mostly gold,
but include copper, lead, etc. Wherever
there are known to be mines tnis cum
pnny owns some.
The head of the Exploration Company is
Hamilton Smith, an old California!], and
the late Mr. de Crana, also a Californian,
assisted in organizing the company. Mr.
Smith is expected to arrive here some
time this month, and froni him Mr. Hoff
man may learn more of the details of the
work he is to do ia Russia.
Mr. Hoffman was seen yesterday after
noon in his office in the Nevada block.
He said: "Yes, I have accepted an offer
from Ihe Exploration Company of London
to go to Russia. I expect to leave with my
son Ross about December 1 next. I can
not give you any particulars except that I
am to go to Russia as an expert for the
company. I wish I knew more myself. I
am going to Russia by way of London,
though to go from this side would be
shorter. They cabled me to come to Lon
don first. Ido not know how long I shall
be gone, or into what part of Russia I shall
go. Ido not know very much about Rus
sian mines. There are rich gold, copper,
silver and diamond mines in the Ural
Mountains. Many or all of these mines.
I believe, are own*d and operated by the
Russian Government. I uo not know
whether I am going into the Urals or not."
Charles F. Hoffman has been encaged
in mining in California about twenty-five
years. For a number of years he has been
superintendent of the Red Point mines at
Red Point, Placer County, which are
owned by a French syndicate. While it
was understood that President Neff wouid
not be a candidate for re-election, Mr.
Hoffman was prominently mentioned for
president of the California Miners' Asso
ciation, recently in Â«ession in this City.
He is regarded as an authority on drift
mining and haÂ« written what is said to be
the best pamphlet on that subject that
has been published. He has had long ex
perience in mining on the Pacific Coast,
including the Comstock and other places.
He has always been a member of tne ex
ecutive committee of the California Min
ers' Association and one of the lending
spirits in the association. His son, Ross,
is a graduate of the mining department of
the btate University. While in scaool he
was a leading athlete, being noted for his
excellence in pole-vaulting and hurdle
racing.
Charles F. Hoffman is outspoken and
decisive on the subject of making mining
a department of the Government, witn its
head one of the President's Cabinet. He
strongly sapno/ts it. He said yesterday :
"I am most heartily in favor of it. There
should not only be a Government ni ning
department, but it should be represented
in the Cabinet, as the Department of Ag
riculture is by the Secretary of Agricul
ture. Mining is one of tbe greatest and
most important industries of our country.
Millions on millions of capital are in
vested in it I regard it fully as import
ant as agriculture, for out of the mines
comes not only money, but various wide
spread industries. I understand that a
bill to create sucli a bureau was intro
troduced in the House some time ago by
Mr. Caminetti of thin State, and I under
stand an effort will be made to bring it
up again during the session of the next
Congress/ ______________
THE MAYOR WORRIED
He Says That the New Official Map
should Be Exhibited for
Sixty Days.
Mayor Sntro is still worried over the
official map of the City, which was re
cently finished by Surveyor Tilton and
which nas been placed on public inspec
tion for thirty days before the contract
price is paid.
The Mayor wanted the map exhibited
for sixty days before it was accepted and
an expert employed to see that every
thing was all right, but the Supervisors
cut the time down to a month and placed
the map in Surveyor Tilton's office for
inspection. Now the Mayor says that the
Surveyor's department is too far out of
ihe way and too busy a place, and wants
the map brought down to his office,
where, he thinks, all will see it.
He thinks tbat, as the map is twelve
feet square, a staging should be built
about It, so that property-owners can get
near all portion?, and agrees to see that
this is arranged I! the map is given into
the care of his office.

EDITOR MARRIOTT'S TRIAL.
It Will Be Called for a Hearing on the
17th Instant.
Editor Fred Marriott of the News Letter
appeared in Judge Daingerfield's court
yesterday to enter his plea to the charge
of libeling Judge Hebbard during the re
cent political campaign. The defendant
pleaded not guilty, and the case will come
up for further hearing on the 17th inst.
Attorneys Del ruas aud Shortridce will
represent the defendant and W. "W. Foote
and Julius Kahn will assist in the prose
cution.
The charge of libel grows out of the
publication of a circular issued by certain
depositors in the Home Savings Bank of
which It. H. McDonald Jr. was the princi
pal manager.
Much interest is manifested in the case
on account of the prominence of the per-
I sons involved.
In addition to the case of Mr. Marriott
the other persons under indictment foi
libeling Judge Hebbard will also be called
on for trial on the- 17th.

The White Car Still Has the

IS IT GOVERNMENT PROTECTION
The Railroad Authorities Claim That
the Regular Mailcars Cannct
Make Time.
The interruption of any of the Market
street cable- cars now by an unfortunate
teamsier might subject niin to the wrath
of ttie United States authorities located in
the red bricK building on Washington and
Sansome streets.
The fact that the Market-street Railroad
system has brought its entire lines into
the transmission of the Cnlted States
mails throughout the City calls for the
protection of the Government should their
line be menaced by" any unforeseen diffi
culties in the shape of obstructions, strikes
or similar annoyance from obstinate em
ployes or obdurate express wagons or
dump-carts.
To prevent any of those unpieasant oc
currences, in addition to the regular
"white mailcar," which now runs over
the various lines of the Market-street rail
road system and which carries the United
States mail from the outside sub-stations
to the ferry at the end of Market street,
the company is causing mail pouches to
be carried on the regular passenger-cars.
A large piece of white canvas with the
words "U. S. Mailcar" painted in large
b^ack letters is stretched on the front of
tne dummy over the headlight, when
these cars are engaged in the transmission
of mail matter from the sub-stations. This
was the case on a car on Mission and
Twenty-fourth streets, and another on
Seventeenth and Castro streets. From J
these stations four deliveries to the princi
pal station at the ferry are made in this j
manner daily.
This service is performed at such time
as the postal authorities deem it expedient
to transmit the mail, which is now twice
in the forenoon and an equal number of
times in the afternoon. Ou each occasion
tiie regular passenger-cars are required to
carry mail matter. The postoffice authori
ties at the sub-stations hand the gripman
of the car a United States pouch of mail
matter. This is placed on the forward
portion of the dummy between the seats
and in the space allowed for the gripmau's
stand.
When this is done the placard with the
U. S. sign is put in place and the cars roll
alons under the protection of the United
States Government.
In tne meantime the white mail-cars
especially built for the mail service make
their regular ru Â» from the central station
at the ferries to Hie outlying sub-stations.
The reason given by the railroad
authorities for the passenger-cars carrying
the mail pouches is that the mail matter
contained therein is special and must be
on time at the ferry to catch outgoing
trains which the regular white cars cannot
do and attend to their regular runs.
By this system of pressing the ordinary
passenger- cars into service as mail-cars it
probably brings the entire Market-street
system under Government protection on
the same principle as any or all of regular
trains which carry mails. But on this
subject the authorities of the Market
street system prefer to remain silent.

travels of a missionary in China," he
said, "that it was tola him there was a
sect called 'The People of the Shrunken
Sinew,' who lived in a certain province and
worshiped an image which they kept
concealed behind a curtain. Fired with
curiosity he set out post haste for the
province named.
"The conviction dawned upon him that
they were Jews, which intensified his de

he did that the Jews did not worship

The rabbi then proceeded to tell how the

law, which was not itseif worshiped, but
only in spirit. This drew forth a learned
dissertation upon the Parseos as compared

SPORTSMAN'S REALM
Doings of the Ring, the Oar, the Gun, the
Gridiron and the Leash*
The ten-round boxing contest between
the scientific pugilists, James Flemming
Carroll and Jack McAuliffe, which will be
decided on Friday evening at Woodward's
Pavilion, is now the principal topic among
sporting men. The fighters are in good
form for a limited bout, and doubtless
they will "put up" a rattling contest. In
the poolrooms even money is being wag
ered on the Choynski-Maher fight, which
will be decided before the Coney Island
(N. V.) Sporting Club on Monday evening.
Of course the event in pugilism that is
attracting the most attention is the com
ing heavy-weight battle between Fitzsim
mons and Sharkey. This will be fought
before the National Club on the evening
of December 2.
In wheeling circles the feature of most
moment is the San Rafael road races,
which will take place on Sunday. The
opening of the new Velodrome track on
Saturday evening next will doubtless
draw a large gathering.
Coursing enthusiasts are deeply inter
ested in the great interstate meeting,
which will be held on the plains of Mer
ced next Monday. In the following col
umns will be found the latest news in all
branches of sporting.
THE WHEELMEN.
Road Raclnir at San Rafael To-mor-
rowâ New Velodrome Track.
If the weather be fair there will be some
good cycle road racing over the San
Rafael way to-morrow, the entries for
which were published in The Call yester
day. There will be a five-mile handicap,
starting at 11:30 a. m, and a one-mile
handicap, starting at 2:30 p.m. A num
ber of the local clubs have called ruus to
witness the contests, and as the prizes are
good and some fast men are entered the
competition should be lively.
The new W lodrome cycle racing track,
situated on the block bounded by Baker,
Lyon, Hayes and Fell streets, will open
with a fine meet next Saturday afternoon.
The principal card on the programme will
be the match races between W. F. Foster
and C. 3. Wells. There will be a number
oi professional and amateur events besides
and a great day's sport is promised.
The Velodrome management is nego
tiating for the appearance here of the
celebrated team now at New Orleans comp
osed of John S. Johnson, Jimmy Michael,
the Welsh wonder, and two triplet pacing
teams, one of which is the famous Jallu
brothers' team of France, ail under the
management of Tom W. Eck. This aggre
gation of racing stars now holds all paced
track records from a quarter of a mile up
to and including the hour record. It will
be a great card if these people come out
here this winter, and Manager Fawcett
confidently expects that he will be suc
cessful in his efforts and that they will be
here within a month.
The Velodrome track is by long odds the
fastest and best ever constructed in this
City, and we should see some racing on it
the like of which has ne'er glaudened our
eyes before. The comfort of the spectators
has been well looked to also, and every
thing has been built substantially and on
a hign scale. For the opening day next
Saturday the different clubs are reserving
blocks of seats. There is ample seating
capacity and they are so arranged that
from all points a good view cau be had of
the entire track and the homestretch in
particular.
The Imperial Cycling Club will meet
next Monday evening to consider a num
ber of resignations caused by the attitude
of a few of its members daring the recent
election toward the candidacy of George
P. Wetmore. He was The wheelmen's
candidate for Superintendent of Streets
and all the clubs supported him with a
few exceptions in the Imperial Club and
the Olympic Club Wheelmen. The split
has cost the Imperial Club a number of its
best members, including the president and
vice-president.

If anybody has ridden a bicycle around
a track and cut out his own pace he may
have a slight idea what a fa>t unpaced
mile meant. When the popular Olympic
Club wheelman, C. R. Coufter, covered a
mile unpaced at Denver recently in
1:59 1-5, the fastest a rider has ever trav
eled this distance without pacemakers, it
was a performance entitled to the highest
commendation. Paced miles under 1-50
are of rather frequent occurrence now
adays, but when a rider gets down to a
condition which enables him to ride un
paced at 1:59 1-5, he is capable of a per
formance that approximates a paced mile
in 1:35.
The next National assembly of the
League of American Wheelmen will be
held at Albary, N. V., in Feoruary. when
matters of great importance will be dis
cussed and voted upon by the delegates.
R. M. Welch will attend from this division
to endeavor to put throug'i the Sunday
racing law, and is sanguine of success.
Captain Carpenter and Lieutenants
Games and Whalley of the Alarneda Cy
clers will lead their lellow members on a
paper chase around the streets of Alameda
to-morrow, an innovation in the club run
line.
Herbert D. Clark, one of the most popu
lar members of the Alameda Cyclers, is
now the cycling editor of the Evening
Post, vice H. Austin Goddard, who is go
ing to London. Goddard was to have left
last week, but important business has de
tained him.
The members of the Bay City Wheel
men enjoyed a club run to Sutro's Baths
last night. Some went by wheels and
others by cars, but they all got tnere in
| time and had a barrel of fun in the water.
| Judges Kerrigan and Dunne were as sol
emn about it as their proverbial ancestral
prototypes, though the former confided in
me that he thought the salt water would
do him good. Sandy Plummer, Walter
Sheldon, Dave Marshall, King Rhys,
George Wetmore, Harry Larkin and a lot
of the old-timers were there, and alto
gether they had a great night's sport.
Captain Day thinks of making these runs
of regular fortnightly occurrence here
after. The house committee is arranging
a pool tournament, and the club's annual
vaudeville entertainment will also be held
soon.
The next meeting of the Associated
Clubs will be held Saturday evening, De
cember 5, at which the annual election
will take place. The candidates for the
presidency thus far known are A. P.
Swain of the Acme Club Wheelmen and
E. F. Weihe of the San Francisco Road
Club. As the delegates from this City,
comprising a majority of the board of
governors, are desirous of keeping the
presidency here, Weihe seems to have the
besi chance. J. F. Hancock will be re
turned as secretary-treasurer without
opposition, as he is a popular and efficient
officer. All clubs belonging to the associa
tion must elect three delegates apiece, and
send in their names to the secretary before
the next meeting, or they cannot vote at
the meeting. The annual dues of $10 are
payable at the same time. The association
now has a membershisp of twenty-two
clubs.
The annual meetings of the California
j Division, L. A. W., and the Associated
â¢ Clubs, have been called for the same even

THE FIGHTERS.
Carroll and McAuliffe Will Meet on
Friday Evening.
The members ot the St. George Club
will be treated to a grand fistic entertain
ment on Friday evening, the 30th inst.
James Flemming Carroll, who is unques
tionably a most polished fighter ol the
new school, will meet his old opponent,
Jack McAuliffe, in a ten-round contest at
Woodward's Garden pavilion.
Carroll may have seen his best daysâ
that is, from a pugilistic point of view â
but there can be no gainsaying the fact
that Jimmy is a wonderfully preserved
fellow, who for the past ten years has
taken the very best care of himself. In
fact, he can go a better race to-day than
many younger men who have indulged in
dissipation to such an extent as to destroy
their constitutions be-fore they reached
their thirtieth yeat.
Carroll has seen 42 winters, but he is
nevertheless as strong and spry as a
well-conditioned lad of 30. As an illus
tration of what a well-preserved man is
capable of accomplishing athletically, the
great championship boat race between
Gaudaur and Stansberry on the Thames
may be mentioned. Gaudaur, who de
feated his opponent rather handsomely
in excellent time, is 38 years of age, and
according to the Sporting Li;e of London,
England, he could have rcdncc-d the time
of the race some seconds if his youn r op
ponent had forced him to better efforts
when nearing the finish.
Therefore Jimmy Carroll should cer
tainly give a first-class account ot him
self on Friday evening next, as he la clever
and a most aggressive fk'bter. McAu
lilfeisaboul33 years old, but durine the
past ten years the champion has lived the
life of a thorough si>ort and invariably
met his friends and boon companions on
Easy street. Of late yearn Jnck has prown
obese and before his departure from New
York for the great Western metropolis he
had all the appearance of a well-to-rio
Alderman. He must have scaled 150
pounds when he landed in t.iis City, but
according to did Professor Farley he has
reduced his avoirdupois by hard exer
cise and on the evening of the content
will be in tolerably good shape to give his
opponent a hot argument for ten rounds.
It Mould be hard to find two men
among the fraternity of pugilists who are
as clever as Jack and Jimmy, consequently
the large crowd of sports w" o will be sure
to witness the mill can count upon seeing
a V? r , t? nd th Â°i"oughlv scientific battle.
Dal Hawkins and Finnick, "the Arkan
sas Kid, will open the evening's enter
tainment wish a ten-round boxing con
test, finnick has a good record, but the
sports of this City are of the opinion that
to win over Hawkins he must be a first
class fighter.
Betting on the McAuliffe and Carroll
match has not commenced vet, but doubt
less McAuliffe will sell a favorite in the
pools.
Barney Farley is of the opinion that
THE SAX FHAXCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1896.
Sharkey is taking moro exercise than he
really requires.
"Tom frequently yUH* my place when
out on his im>riiiiÂ»K run," Â»aÂ»d the old vet
erau, 'and "pon my word I think he is
doing too much hm.l work. He is now in
condition t.. onim Iho ring, and instead
of radnetng 1 think he should be taking
on BMh.
" 1 liÂ« ilrst thlntr Slinrkcy will find is that
M bM â  tu.,l fooling produced, of course
by ovortiatntiiH. I can assure you that
overtraining in ns bad as no training at
all. If Turn continues to pump himself
out l>y hard rond exerciÃe, he will find
himself nil tu>d up by the time he is called
upon to niot-t the Cornishman."
Fariey is not far off the mark in his
statement concerning Sharkey. The
sailor is now us hard as nails, and all
that he apparently requires is sufficient
exercise to keep nis breathing apparatus
in good condition.
Hard and heavy exercise will not im
prove Sharkey's condition, now that he is
physically in form to enter a ring at a
moment's notice. Short and sharp exor
cise is what the sailor requires from now
until the day of the battle, but, oi course,
his trainers should be the beter judges of
the kind and- amount of exeicise SharKey
requires to lit him for a ten-round contest.
â¢Fitzsimmons states that three weeks'
training is all that he will need to fit him
for a limited contest. He wants to be
perfectly free of action when he opens his
guns, so to speak, on the enemy. Oid
trainers contend that overtraining is sure
to bring about a stiff feeling in the
muscles.
George Green is angry; he has a kick
corning. Yesterday tie received a copy of
an English sporting paper in which ap
peared an article concerning George. The
writer calkd Green a lifth-rate dub and
that his light in this City with Tom Tracey
was a fake. Tbe story was based on a let
ter written from Chicago by "Colonel"
Hopkins, in which the manager stated
that the latter threw the fight with Green,
fearing that if he won he would be unable
to get on a match with Buree.
Every person who witnessed the contest
Will laugh at such a statement. Green
won the fight on his merits, and it is a
very good wager that Tracey will acknowl
edge the same to any person who may be
desirous of -knowing the facts.
Tracey was handicapped some pounds
in weight, but so far" as the fight is con
cerned he was fairly deieaied and he ac
knowledged t at lact la the presence of
the writer and several witnesses a tew
evenings after the battle. On Wednes
day he received a message from the Olym
pic Club of Birmingham, England, stating
These Four Men Are Doing: the Brainwork for the Berkeley Team.
that a purse of $3500 was subscribed for a
match between Burge and Green, and
that he (Green) would receive $500 for
expenses. The C.ilifornian answered his
acceptance, but after seeing the publica
tion already referred ;o he stated that he
had changed his mind about going to
England, as be did not believe he would
be accorded fair play in that country.
FOOTBALL.
The Olympic and Reliance Teams
Will Meet To-Day.
BERKELEY, Cm.., Nov. tt.-Whatever
may be said of the strength, brilliancy or
weakness of the individual players of the
Berkeley and Stanford football teams at
the present time, there is a co-existent
feeling of anxiety and uncertainty which
is perhaps only exceeded durinir the entire
football season by the suspense which
arises on the day of the great game, when
the two teams, with girded loins and full
armor, step on the field of battle. Only
twelve days remain before the brawn and
muscle of our two California universities
meet on the gridiron, and during this
short remaining time the fate of either
may be easily determined.
So closely matched have the teams been
in tne past ana so closely matched do they
seem to beat the present time that a slight
loss on either side may result in a propor
tional ely greater Jo-s on the day of the
big game. The training season has pro
gressed so far that it would not be a diffi
cult matter to pick out fifteen men, irom
which number the Varsity eleven will be
selected, providing, of course, that no
serious injury befalls any of these men, or
that they may become disqualified for
other reasons. It would be practically
impossible at this late date in the practice
season to train up a green man to Varsity
form, or lor a very seriously injured
player on ttoe tirst or second elevens to
recover sufficiently to ent^r the match.
As the time for the final struggle draws
closer and closer at hand the work of the
team will be redoubled, and with each
harder stroke that is required of them
comes a proportionate risk of being in
jured. It is tUe fear of injury which gives
rise 10 the supreme anxiety on the part of
both the players themselves and the stu
dent body, for each injury eitner means
that one man less will be able to enter the
big game or to try for substitute.
For the last three years it haa seemed to
be the inevitable fate of Berkeley to have
some of her best men laid off either en
tirely or for a short time just before
Thanksgiving day. Last year Ransorae
injured his knee about two weeks before
tne intercollegiate, and was forced to lay
off for almost the entire remaining time-
Snerman sprained his ankle, and conse
quently was not up to form, and Hupp
was only able to stay with the gsme a few
minutes because of previously sustained
injuries. Almost the same situation pre
vails again this year. Three of t-ie five
Varsity players who returned are now
laid up with bruises and sprains which
may prevent them from entering, at least
from playing the entire time.
The injuries to these three players and
the danger of having still more of the
best men on the team laid off has had a
tendency to put Berkeley decidedly on
the gui vive. Each time that a good man
has been laid off great harm lias been
worked to the team. It has meant that
his experienced services have been lost
that a new man had to be coached for the
vacant place and that a risk has been run
in attempting to secure as good a suc
cessor. Because of the inability of some
of the men to play throughout the season
a great, deal of changing about has been
necessary. Some of the men who have
been playing at guard part of the season
have been changed to tackle, and vice
versa.
Several of the men who have been ac
customed to work back of the line have
been put on the line, and only a few days
ago Birdsall, who has been playing center

of the Reliance Team.
all season, was tried at gnard. The men
who seem to have kept their places better
than others are those who have been
trying for quarter and for end.
Injuries, nowever, have not been the sole
reason for chunking these players about
so frequently. The weights of the various
men have had something to do with it.
Carr, who had always played na |f Here
tofore, was put on the line as tackle a
fortnight ago; Ludlow, who was accus
tomed to tackle, was put at guard; Castle
nun was moved from tackle to guard; Mc-
Dermott ha? been playing both center and
guard, and Avery, who was a last year's
guard, has been trying for tackle this sea
son.
The interest in football this year, not
withstanding the somewhat unfavorable
outlook just at this time on account of
injured members of the team, seems to be
unprecedented.
lne students have been most enthusi
astic in their support of the team, and if
good will and support count for anything
in a match then surely Berkeley will be
well supported.
Tne course of training from now until
the end of the season will be directed
more toward team work than to individual
wi i!"i- Â° ecr t practice, signal work ami
blackboard lectures will be the features for
the next ten days. Hard line work, how
ever, will by no means be subordinated,
but, rather, will be more vigorous than
he retofore. Meanwhile th# student body
will be busily engaged in doing their share
on the side lines and in preparing to drown
the yells of the Stanford men on Thanks
giving day.
To-Day's Game.
To-day is the beginning of the end of
the present football season on this coast.
Reliance and Olympic, the great athletic
club rivals of the West, will meet at 3
o'clock this afternoon for the first time
this year to decide whether Oakland or
San Francisco shall be known during the
coming year as the champion football city
of the State.
Both teams have gone through a season
of hard training and both have met Berke
ley and Palo Alto several times, with
varying results that have made it most
difficult to draw any reliable conclusions
as to the relative strength of the two
elevens.
Heretofore Reliance has always been the
victor in contests with Olympic, but this
season the prospects of the local club have
been very mucn better than for several
years past. To begin witn, the untiring
coaching of Stickney, the old Harvard
player, has been of great benefit both in
training and inspiring the men.
Unfortunately for the Olympics the
plucky St.ckney is "out of it" because of
an injury, an ( his best alternate, the
dashing young Thierkauf, is also laid up.
These two losses will, in themselves,
minimize the advantage formerly con
ceded to Olympic. To-day's game, as the
teams stand, should be close, with a shade
in favor of the maroon and white from
Oakland.
Olympic enters the game with a remark
able collection of players. There are Wel
don and Code formerly of the Stanford
team, Smith and Porter formerly of the
Berkeley team, Ames and Nolan formerly
of the West Point team, and McCormick
formerly of the Annapolis team.
In addition to these Snowden is an old
Stanford baseball pitcher and Kington is
a student of the college of pharmacy of
the University of California.
The Reliance team has not drawn so ex
tensively from outside sources for its play
ers, but Walton and Burnett are old Stan
ford Varsity players.
The Reliance will put up a hard, clean
game to-day, and though not overconfi
dent of winning expect to be on top by a
smull margin.
They have been handicapped in not
having a second eleven, and therefore
were unable to perfect their team as they
wished.
At the beginning of the season arrange
ments were made to play Berkeley two
practice games a week. After playing
two games, for same unknown reason the
Berkeleys' invitation extended to the Re
liance team was withdrawn, and the
Raliance men were compelled to make
long journeys to Palo Alto for practice.
Oliver, their giant guard, has been laid
up with a sprained ankle. He will play
in to-day's game, but it is feared he will

Wyckoff has had but very little practice
and Racine, who takes Lanyon's place at
end, has only lined up with tne team
twice this season.
Middlemas has recovered from his in
juries and will play his old position at

man will give a good account of himseif.
He will enter the game in tair condition.
With all these setbacks Reliance expects
to repeat its victory of last year over
Olympic.
Carter, New comb, Dosch, Platt, Pringle

QUAIL AND DUCKS.
The Outlook for a Good Storm To-
Morrow Is Promising.
If the predictions of "Weather Prophet
McAdie come true the duck-hunters will
certainly be in the swim to-morrow.
A severe rain and wind siorm has been
raging in the Northwest and a heavy blow
is expected to reach here to-day or to
morrow. Doubtless the storm in the
north will be the means of driving large
numbers of canvasback. sprieand widgeon
to this coast, where they will receive a
warm reception from the lovers of duck
shooting who have been anxiously waiting
the opportunity for a good shoot.
The weather up to the present has been
very favorable for upland shooting as
sufficient rain has fallen to dampen the
ground, so that hunting-dogs can readily
locale the game.
Yesterday two Hunters named Wilson
and Charnley bagged forty-three ducks
near BurdeH's, on the Sonoma marsn, in a
few hours 1 morning shooting. It is said

Of all the means that fnedical skiil has

"I am advocating Paine's celery com-

it has done ma so mucn good in a very

had lo.*t abont 30 pounds in weight, and
was getting weaker and more nervous
every day. I was unable to stand exer-
tions oi any kind, and I used conveyances
for every short distance.
"After taking two bottles of Paine's cel-

CRICKET CHIRPS.
How the Game Is Played on the Atlan
tic Ocean.
"While the Australian cricket season is
hardly open and the grounds of Eugliah
and American clubs are closed for the
season, the enthusiastic player can still
j:et his game â if he will spend sufficient
time and money. His quest will involve
j\- considerable journey, for the game in
â juestion will be found on board the giant
steamers plying between Cape Town and
Southampton.
Ex-Judge Richard Rising, who has just
returned from a trip around the world,
was giving me some information regard
ing the cricket game as played daily
tiboard the good ship Norman during a
recent honieward-bound passage. Next to
the ail important "run sweepstake" it is,
par excellence, the event of the day. A
portion of tne deck, measuring about 2ox
.000 feet, is inclosed with nets, and the
pitch is arranged accordingly. Of course
the prescribed limits of the "field" neces
sitates a unique placing of the fielders,
and,-equally of course, "boundaries" are
frequent. But the wicket is true, and
.mo.it exciting matches are the rule. Out
side tbe inclosure the ladies and their
escorts form a merry crowd of spectators,
and mingle their applause and lausrbtt-r
â with the musical strains of the ship's
orchestra.
During the three days occupied in cross
ing the Hue, however, the sport is aban
doned. It is the rirat limit to cricket
. enthusiasm on record.
By some extraordinary mismanagement
the late Australian match has left the
California Cricket Association in a finan
cial hole. By way of extricating them
selves therefrom the cricketers are ar
ranging a graud benefit performance at
. one of the theaters. The Olympic Club,
which is always to the fore in emergencies
of this kind, has offered to assist, and a
programme of unusual merit will doubt
less result. I will have the full particulars
for next week's Chirps. Vmpike.

The Union Court Is In the Hands of

The proprietor of the Union handball
,court On Howard street failed in business
â¢ last Tuesday, and the old place, which
has been patronized for many years by
â¢ the lovers oi' the great old Irish game, is
now in charge of the Sheriff, and a big
black lock, indicative of power, hangs on
the door. In all probability the place
will remain unoccupied for some time,
as the court is of very ancient construc
tion, and the players of to-day are not par
ticularly fascinated with it.
Phil Ryan's San Fraacisco ball-court is
largely patronized by the fraternity. It

NOT NECESSARY.
The SupervianrA J.ny Two Board of
Health Ordinances on the Shelf
for an Indefinite Period.
The Joint Committee on Health and Police
anJ Judiciary of the Board of Supervisors dis
posed of two ordinances recently proposed by
the Board of Health in a summary manner
yesterday.
Attorney J. B. Reinstein drew up â¢ the
measures, but it was speedily discovered that
they were not necessary and their fate was "in
definite postponement."
The firft referred to the inspection of food
for public institutions and required that all
meat and milk furnished tnem be offered for
inspection at one of the public inspection
stations before being delivered.
On the snowing taut the heads of the various
public institutions regularly inspected the
mat -rials this was found to be unnecessary
and laid on the shelf.
The 6econd, requiring that all meat in
tended for use in this City be taken to the
stations, suffered a like fate on the statement
by Chief Food Inspector Dockery that all
meat is examined by United btates and local
inspectors before being allowed entry into the
City and -\vouid only go to the htations after it
had been stamped as wholesome.
The clecisiou of the joint committee highly
pleased a large delegation of butchers who
were present to protest against the ordinances
on the ground that the measures would put
them to much unnecessary expense and
trouble.

MAY DIE IN PRISON.
An Effort to Secure a Pardon for
Thomas McGowan.
Efforts are being made to secare a par
don for Thomas McGowan, who nine
months ago was sentenced to serve one
year in the Alameda County Jail for as
sisting in smuggling opium. McGowan
was a fireman on one of tbe steamers run
ning to British Columbia. Boon after he
was sentenced he showed pronounced
symptoms of consumption, and his illness
was increased by malaria and typhoid
pneumonia. On Thursday United States
District Judge Morrow made an order for
McGowan to be removed from the j til to
the Receiving Hospital in Oakland, where
he can Have medical attendance.
United Sta es District Attorney Foote
has become interested in the sniucgler's
unhappy condition, and yesterday he
sent a letter to Attorney-General Har
mon at Washinston, D. C., asking for a
pardon for McGowan on account of ill
health. He has taken this interest in tne
convict because the latter has no funds to
secure the help of an attorney to present
the case at the capital. Another motive
for the interest is that McGowan has a
wife and a small child still in arms. Mr.
Foote has requested that immediate at
tention be paid to the petition, ior, while
the remainder of McGowan's term is
short, the fellow may not live to serve out
the full time. Mr. Foote fears that unless
speedy action be taken the prisoner will
die in jail.
ASSESSOR SIEBE SUED.
Formal Demand for 9138,299 on Ac-
count of Uncollected Taxes.
District Attorney AY. S. Barnes, on be
half of the S;ate of California, yesterday
filed a suit acainst Assessor John D. Siebe
and the sureties on his offic al bond, John
P. Ortman, Henry Plageman and Henry
F. Fortman, for the modest sum of
$138,2t)9.
As a cause of action Mr. Barnes alleges
that Assessor Siebe tailed to perform his
full duty in assessing and collecting taxes
on persona] property not secured by real
estate, and mat on account of this neglect
the public treasury has lost the amount
said to be due.
For this reason Mr. Siebe and his bonds
men are requested to make tue deficit good.
Very little importance is attached to
this suit by the financial oiheers of the
City and County of San Francisco. A
similar suit for $50,000 was begun against
Mr. Siebe a year ago, but nothing came of
it. The new law requires the District At
torney to hie the complaint, however, and
he baa complied with that formality.

The Alerts Will Meet the Stars
at Central Park To-
Morrow.
It Is Doubtful Whether the Lively
Alameda Boys cr the Nevada Con
stellation Are the Stronger.
The game of ball between the Alameda
Alerts and Nevada Stars, to take place to
morrow afternoon at Central Park promises
to be the most interesting of any sinca the
game has been revived. Alameda is very
proud of trie boys that make up the great
Alert team, and well thsy may be, for all
San Francisco and Oakland almost swear
by them, and would back them against
any team.
The battery work of Hammond and
McKee is a feature worth seeing, not to
mention the wonderful playine of the
other members ot the team. On the othc
side of the diamond, the Stars are not
going to take a back seat if tUey can
heip it. Their backers are coming down
from Nevada to "root" for their cham
pions. In the previous contest it was
anybody's game until the fatal inninr,
winch put the Stars in the lead and made
many a heart sore in Alameda and caused
the Alerts to ic.ck on the old balls fur
nished and finally leave the faeid.
They now have a chance to get even and
propose to take advantage of it to-morrow
at Central Park.
This will give all Alamedans a chance

TUB SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1596.
A BOY'S PLEA FOR
A FREE PARDON
Ramon Herrera Claims
That He Is Unjustly
Imprisoned.
Convicted of a Robbery Com
mitted by Manuel
Portillo,
SENTENCED TO TWENTY YEARS
Testimony to Show Tiiat the Lad
Suffers Instead of One Who Was
Shot in Mexico.
When the Board of State Prison Com
missioners meet to-day they will consider
a petition for a pardon of a convict that
is of more than usual interest. To the
Commissioners are referred all petitions
for pardons made to Governor Budd.
The petition in question has already
RAMON HERRERA, Who Is Imprisoned in San Quentin for a
Crime That Is Said to Have Been Committed by Another.
been presentel to the Governor. It is the
case of a boy, Ramon Herrera, who with
his friends and relatives asserts that he is
entirely innocent of tne crime of robbery
of which he was convicted and for wbicn
he was sentenced to serve twenty years'
imprisonment among the felons and
rogues at San Quentin.
The court records show that in the
latter part of 1893 a Chinaman named
Leong Tom was assaulted and robbed
after midnight by two mat-Iced footpads,
who took from him his gold watch and
$25. Isador Baldivia, Ramon Herrera
and Manuel Portillio were arrested for the
crime.
Baldivia pleaded guilty to the charge
and was sentenced to twenty years' im
prisonment. Herrera protested that he
was innocent, and his mother and two
sisters teutihed that the boy, then 17 years
of agp, was at home and in bed at the
time of the robbery.
However, the victim positively identi
fied the lad as one of the assailants, not
withstanding that he said the robbers
wore masks over their faces. Por*.illo was
acquitted for all that the police recovered
the Cuinaman's watch from a pawnshop,
where it had been pawned by Porlilio,
who skipped off 'o Mexico as soon as he
was released. Portiilo's liberty did him
but little good, for be was since shot to
death while attempting to holdup a train
near Guaymas.
All of this time fierrera's relatives and
friends have been hunting for eviJence to
prove the innocence of the boy, and now
they claim to have all the proof necessary
to establish this as a fa<t. His mends
are numerous and influential, and those
who are the deepest interested are among
the be^t citizens of this City. They desire
not to be known, but among them is one
who, although an attorney, is handling
the case purely in the interest of ju-tice.
He is Aduison E. Shaw of bO6 Montgom
ery street.
From M>. Shaw the inside facts were
learned, which, in substance, are thesa:
The boy, Ramon Herrera. was industrious
and always gave his widowed mother ail
that be earned. On the nigntof the rob
bery the lad was in bed. Herrera dressed
similar to Portillo, who d.d not bear the
best of a reputation, although he was of a
good family. When the lad was arrested
he wished to shield his family from dis
grace, and gave the name of Charles
Garcia.
His first sad experience was with sev
eral Police Court practitioners, who took
all the money that the family could raise
and then neglected to protect their client,
and took no pahjs to bring out the evi
dence that would have secured his acqnit
tal. Even on the trial Baldivia testified
that Herrera was an innocent person, and
that it was another man wno assisted in
robbing the Chinaman. Why so little at
tention was paid to the fact that the
Chinaman's watch had been pawned by
Portillo could never be learned. The boy
was. convicted solely upon the testimony
of the Chinaman.
Shortly after the trial Baldivia repented
and swore to the statement that he had
made upon the witness-stand that Herrera
was innocent. It was not until Portillo
was well out of the btate that he truve his
accomp ice's name. In concluding his
deposition Baloivia says:
The foregoing statement has been made by
me orahy in Police Court lat the time of my
preliminary examination, to tie Judge of said
court, to my attorney, A. B. TreHdwell, and
since then to the Deputy Sheriffs in the
County Jml, and to the family of said Charles
Garcia (the iiunic under which he wns sen
tenced). 1 have done no and do so now as an
act ot justice to said Charles Gxrcia and in the
hone tna.t an innocent man may be vindicated.
T;ie said robbery was committed by Manuel
Portillo and myself. Ifador Balmvia.
Tins is not the only evidence in the pos
f-ession of the boy's friends. Miss Soledad
Cota, upon oath, made a. statement that
the was well scquainted with Portillo un
til he left for Mexico. She said that after
she arrest of Baldivia and Herrera for
robbing the Chinaman Portillo called at
her home and said that he had not been a
fool in the matter, and the Chinaman had
identified Herrera as one of his assail
ants. He said to her that it was a clear
case of mistaken identity. \Vhen con
fronted by the victim Portillo turned up
his coat collar and pulied his hat over his
eyes, and the disguise worktd well, for
the Chinaman picked out the other man.
In her testimony Miss Cota said:
Portillo boasted of his success. He explained
to me that the sign he gave to his confederate
that no officer was in sijtht was by sliding his
foot along the pavement. After the arrest of
Herrera Portillo frequently said to me that
.Herrera was noi the guilty party, but that the
robbery was committed by him-e!t and Bal
divia. Herrera was in no wav implicated in
the affair in any manner whatever.
Miss Cota was not the only one to whom
Portillo confided the fact that he and
not Herrera was the second man, but that
he did not intend to get himself into
trouble by acknowledging the crime. The
reason these people did not come forward
in the cause oi justice was because of their
fear of the desperado, who always went
armed and who had tlie reputation of
being treacherous and revengeful. Now
that the fellow has met his death tnev
are less reserved, although some are fear
ful lest their disclosures give offense to
the man's family or friends.
AU of these facts and others equally im
portant have been prepared by Attorney
Shaw and bis friends in the boy's behalf.
They exoect to so clearly establish the
young fei!ow's innocence that even the
most critical will have to admit tuat he
has, for the past two years or more, been
made to suffer Jor tbe crime of another.
Had the boy's case been properly han
dled at the preliminary hearing and dur
ing the trial bis friends are sure that he
never would have worn a felon's stripes.
All of the blunders were made through
the ignorance of himself and family of the
English language and American customs,
and the lax manner of the Police Court
practitioners into whose hands he fell.
HINRICHS-BEEL CONCERT
Large Audience in Attendance
at the Baldwin
Theater.
Among the Auiitors Were a Delega
tion of Blind Boys and Girls
Who Were Please 1.
The third concert of the Hinrichs-Beel
symphony orchestra in the Baldwin
Theater yesterday afternoon called out a
large audience. The hack rows of seats
were filled by children and young misses
from the Institution for the Deaf, Dumb
and Blind at Berkeley. Most of such at
tendants were blind. There were little
fellows with fat and rosy cheeks who
seemed to feel an irresistible tendency to
merriment between the selections, but
were decorously silent while the
orchestra was playing. There were little
misses who did not know what was on the
programme and were puzzled over the
names of the musical numbers and won
dered audibly as to wbat sort of an in
strument it was that occasionally struck
their ears with an unfamiliar sort of tone.
They came with teachers from tne insti
tution and were assisted to their seats and
there gave tuemaelves up to hearing all
they could.
The concert was not at all even. The
lack of precision was painfully manifested
several times by the necessary sharp rap
of the conductor's baton upon his mu:-ic
rack to biiug the musicians together.
The Gacie overture, "Ostian," went over
very well, although it had a rather in
auspicious beginning. The imaginative
composition is le^s exacting in coloring
than many others. It carries its own
story and was easily within the scope of
the orchestra, but a Jittlo more prelimin
ary rehearsing would uot have detracted
from the general effect.
The most ambitious number on the pro
gramme was the Tschaikowsy Suite No. 3.
The fine movements which exact differ
ent sorts of treatment reached a natural
climax and culmination in the Polacca,
and here it was that the orchestra was at
its best. The rendering was spirited,
well concerted and effective. The audi
ence look very kindly to it. The scherzo
was less well handled. In the theme and
variations some very excellent wort was
done by the strings and also by the wood
wind. The very singular "Vaise Melan
colique," which may or may not have
been suggested by Saint-Saens' "Danse
Macabre," and which in its way is as
grimly suggestive, was done witn very
fcood effect.
The other numbers were two by Mac-
Dowell and the well-known "Rakoczy
March" from Berlioz's "Damnation of
Faust." The last named endtd the enter
tainment spiritedly. There was much
good work during the afternoon, and
some that was quite ragge.i. A fair esti
mate would be that it was uneven on
the whole. Mr. Hinricbs conducted con
scientiously, as usual.

SWEARS SHE IS HIS
LEGAL SPOUSE
Mrs. Abbott Says She Was
Married to Thomas
Quackenbush.
Exhibits a Contract Which She
Contends Constitutes a
Legal Claim.
HE PAID FOR HER HOUSE RENT
Opening of the Deposition Proceedings
Between tbe Aged Millionaire
and His Ex-Housekeeper.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Nancy A. Abbott's
deposition to be used in the proceedings insti
gated against her by Thomas QuackenDush to
prove that he is not her contract husband as
she alleges was commenced before Notary
Public Milton S. Latham. The taking of the
deposition was not concluded, however.
Before it can be concluded the courts will be
called upon to decided several intricate points
of law. This done Mrs. Abbott or Quacken
bush will continue giving her testimony be
fore Notary Latham next Tuesday, and it the
opposing attorneys can agree the deposition
will be completed on that date.
Mrs. Abboit was attended by her attorney,
Arthur Rodgers, ana Mr. Quackenbush, who
was confined to his home through illness, was
represented by his counsel, E. J. Pringle.
Attorney Pringle fired the opening shot by
asking Mrs. Abbott when Mr. Quackenbush
and herself began living In the same house, 16
Montgomery avenue. This* question was clev
erly parried and the attorney continued, "Who
did the work there?" The witness answered,
"I did my housework," and added that Mr.
Quacicenbnsh supported her during their resi
dence in the Montgomery-avenue dwelling.
In response to a question Mrs. Abbott said
that Mr. Quackenbush came to her house as a
lodger, but after the first month that unsatis
factory lelationship ceased. ''Instead of pay
ing rent for the room he occupied at first," the
witness continued, "he paid the rent of the
entire house."
This statement was accompanied by a smile.
"Do you claim to be married to Mr.QuacKcn
bush?" said Attorney Pringle.
Mrs. Abbott glanced at her counsel as though
expecting an objection, but, as none was forth
coming, nnswered:
"Of course I claim to be married to him. I
was married to him. lam married to him."
Several questions relating to the relation
ship and date of marriage were then asked by
Mr. Quackenbush's counsel, but owing to the
vigorous objections of Attorney Rodgers they
were left to De passed on by the courts.
"Have you any writing from the plaintiff by
which you claim to be married to Mr. Quacken
busn?" was asked.
("I have," said the witness, and her counsel
exhibited it. "I wrote the contract," said
Mrs. Abbott, "but, of course, this signature
\vrs signed by himself. I objected to his liv
ing in the house uuless the ceremony, which
had been several times pos'.poned, was per
formed in some manner. He dictated ;he con
tract. I a^s sled wheu it was necessary, and I
wrote the document."
Several questions of minor importance were
answered, and then came the finale of the
day's proceedings in the shape of a question
considered irrelevant by the witness' counsel.
"L'p to the end of 1892 did you call yourself
a widow or a divorced woman?" asked Attor
ney Pringle. Mrs. Abbott or Quackenbush
smiled and her couusel entered a strenuous
objection.
"About anything which relates to this con
tract we are willing to have questions asked."
he said. "But questions that do not directly
bear on this contract are irrelevant. I intend
soon to bring a suit for maintenance, however,
which will open the door to all such in
quiries."
With this the taking of the deposition was
concluded for the day, in order thatcontended
points might be presented to the courts for
settlement.

SHE SHEDS REAL TEARS
Miss Bateman Laughs on the
Stage and Cries Behind
the Scenes.
The Result of an Insinuating Article
Concerning Her in an After
noon Paper.
Miss Victory Bateman went through her
part at the Grand Opera-house in tears last
evening, the result o^ an article in an atter
noon paper regarding 'her almost fatal error
Wednesday night, *hen she took a dose of
poison, tuin'uiug it was phenacetine. The
uctrts-s came home from the theater after the
performance suffering from a neuralgic at
tack, hi. J during tne night, seeking to allay
the pain, took the noxious powder.
She immediately became sick and elected
the poison, recovering sufficitntly to play at
the theater tbe following evening.
Miss Bateman was seen in her dressing-room
at the Grand Opera-house a few moments be
fore her call to go on the stape a> Doiothy in
â¢â¢Tne Minute Men of 1774-75." indulging in a
good cryâ vo 1 . a p!av cry, but a real one, with
out slow music and subdued lights. Baa was
all unstrung, aud her manager, Mr. Moroscu,
who was present, was ft arf.il that the piece
would have to go on without his leading lady.
â¢'A reporter of the papt-r In question called
on me at rehearsal this forenoon," sne said,
"and I told him I would rattier not have any
thing more of this unfortunate affair said, as
I had suffered euough already in body and
mind over it. I am not sure just what the
powder was, but it made me deathly ill, and J
was told it was strychnine. The reporter
went away angry because 1 would not go into
details, and so he said in his paper first that I
did not take poison, and then intimated that
if it were poison I took it with suicidal in
tent.
"How ridiculous and how iÂ»;ust! What
have I to commit suicide ior ? 1 am perfectly
happy with my mother and in my th->atrical
work. I never in my life was wretclied enough
to think of such a thing."
Then the caliboy appeared at the door and
Dorothy, the Yankee girl, wiping the tears
that were not in the piny, went out on the
stage to meet her British officer lover.
EXPENSIVE PRISONER.
Forty Dollar? a Week for Ten Weeks
to Watch a Sick Man.
"This man Norton has already cost this
City $400 for men to watch him, and 1 am
willing to have him admitted to bail in
order to stop the expense," said District
Attorney Barnes in Judge Slack's court
yesterday.
The court expressed a willingness to
protect the City treasury as far as possible
and Mr. Barnes explained.
S. R. Norton was arrested in Yolo
County some time ago on a charge of em
bezzling $100. He came to San Francisco,
where he was arrested and taken back to
the place wnere the crime was alleged to
have been committed. There he was ad
mitted to bail and at onco reiurned to this
City.
He had no sooner arrived in San Fran
cisco than another warrant was served on
him and he was again taken into custody.
Then a writ of habeas coruus was sued out
in his benalf, under whicti the Chiei of
Police was ordered to produce the pris
oner's body in Judge Hebbard's court.
Before that could be done Norton fell se
riously ill and has been sictc in bed in his
own home ever since.
All thin time officers have been watch
ini? Norton day ana night to see that he
didn't escape. Ten weeks have elapsed,
and as it costs $40 a week for watchers to
guard a man who shows no symptoms of
getting well the District Attorney thinks
it is time to call a halt.
Judge Slack agreed with this view of the
matter and oruered that Norton be ad
mitted to bail in the sum of $1000. a bond
for which will be riled to-day or Monday.
The bail fixed by Judge Hebbard was
$2000, whicti was more than Norton was
able to supply.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.

Will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
No one now doubts that a brighter day is dawning
aid U is a common remark that never before bas
business shown so grea. a change for the better
within a single week. Dispatc.ies telling of about
&00 works which have opened or materially en
larged their forces give only a partial report, for
throughout the country tbe gidn has been turpr.s

American wh- at continues an important factor

Many tex'lle works have been started or In

ARE ROTTING
Interior Ranchers Complain
of a Lack of Good
Roads.
Farmer Leberer Says That He
Suffers Because of Local
Politics.
BLAMES ONE ROADMASTER
Several Families in Palomares Canyon
Have Been Forced to
Leave.
" Oakt-awd Office Saw Fraxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 13. )
â¢ Tons of crapes are rotting in the in
terior of the county because of the lack oi
highways. Much complaint is being made
of the condition of existing roads and of
the refusal of the Supervisors to accept
â¢ other roads in the vicinity of Dublin and
' Palomares Canyon.
Some years ago one of these roads that
(*nds at the Leberer ranch passed through
iarnis of fifteen families, all o* whom
"were prospering comparatively well. They
united in building about three miles of
road, which they requested the county to
â¢â¢accept and keep in repair, because with
Ihe fall of the prices for produce during
tbe past four years they could no longer
'afford to do it themselves. They now de
clare that part was accepted, but is
neglected, while the larger portion has
â¢ not even been accepted. In consequence
of this lack of good roads fifteen families i
have been reduced to four, and even the
lew remaining say that they cannot con
tinue for one more season unless some :
adequate reiief is afforded them.
An inspection of this territory yester
day proved the truth of the statement so
far as the condition of the roads and the j
'. wasting of the crops is concerned. On the
Leberer ranch several ton 3of fine grapes |
have rotted on the vines because they j
could not be hauled to market at a cost >
sufficiently low to leave any margin at j
all, and so f:ir there has only been one
good rain. The same is true of t:;e apples. |
"..Under every tree first-class fruit has I
rotted and is stiil falling from the trees j
from which it w.as not gathered, because
of the" expense of getting it to market. !
Squashes, tomatoes, figs and vegetables
â¢ are alTdecaying from toe same cause, and
ranches that were once profitable can only
.be worked at a loss, which means, of
course, that they will be ultimately de
"serted unless relief is had.
â¢'â¢ "I attribute all this neglect of our
J^eads, '' said Mr. .Leberer yesterday, "to!
thâ¬ personal ieelinp of our pres nt road- I
master, Mr. Jensen. Some time ago he [
tried to be el cted Supervisor, but was de- j
fCated, and he has always blamed the
rancher- in this neighborhood for his de- I
feat. Now that he is roaimaster he is j
placing every obstacle in our way, and we j
are feeling it bitterly."
Whatever may be the cause of the
ranchers' trouble there is no doubt a? to
the effect, for a'l that he said regarding
.his loss of fruit and the poor condition of
the roads cannot be denied.
1 Woman Attorney.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 13 âThe second
woman attorney in the history of this
county to practice before the Superior
Court appeared before Judge Fnck this
morning to represent Clara Frisbee, a pro
fessional nurse, in her suit for $10,500 dam

ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 18.â A test is to be made of the power of the wraith

E. H. Nauman, formerly a roomer in the house occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. William Broderick, declares that the departed spirit of Mrs. Alonzo
Green, who committed suicide, returns to revile those who persist ind^obey
ing her edict against card-playing. "We have had cakewalits," said the young
man to-day, "and private theatricals, besides all other kinds of amusements,
but there was no disturbance of any kind except when we played card*. I
know it is real, for I lived there for two months, and when those unearthly
groans struck my ears I was frozen to my chair. We havb arranged to have
a special card party and to place guards around the house, and if possible we
will lay that ghost."

RETURNS TO MARRY.
Kx-Pol iceman Howlett Slakes Another
Chapter of History.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 13.â The return
of F. W. Howlett to this city and his mar
riage to Miss Ada Freeman, the sister of
Kate Castleton, last Tuesday is the first
heard of him since his sudden disappear
ance from this city six years ago.
Howlett was a police officer under Chief
Tompkins and married a daugbter of
Louis SchafTer. All was well until an
other woman appeared and the home was
broken up. Some time later he disap
peared and has not been In Oakland until
recently.
Mrs. Howlett sought revenge in a
humorous manner at the time and in
serted the following advertisement in the
papers:
Lost, strayed or stolenâ An individual whom
in an unguarded moineni 1 adopted as my
husband. He is a good-looking but feeble
individual who answers to the name of Fred.
When last se<.-n was In company with a cross
eyeti womau, his arm around her waist, walk
nig up tho plank road, looking more like a
fool, if possible, (han ever. Any one who will
catch the poor fellow and bring him saiely
Dack so that lean chastise him for running
away will be invited to stay to tea and see the
fun ana no questions asked.
Miss Freeman is the divorced wife of
Castle Brydges, formerly tenor in Charles
Reed's minstrels. Slie returned to Oak
land six months ago and gave out that phe
was to be married, but tbe name of the
groom-elect was kept secret.
NO MORE FREE CLINICS
For Once the Three Warring
Schools of Medicine Can
Agree.
They Withdraw From Lodge Work
and Giving Free Surgical and
Medical Ail
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 13. )
Free clinics and lodge physicians in
; Alameda County will soon be things of
the past. The Alameda County Medical
Society, Alameda County Eclectic Medical
j Society and the Alameda County Homeo
| patliic Medical Society have agreed that
free clinics and lodge physicians have
been used as a cloak for quacks under the
color of benevolence, and that the end of
I both is a public benefit.
The matter was taken up some time ago
' Ly the .Medical Society, and a committee
' was appointed to secure the co-operation
i of the eclectic and homeopathic schools.
Meetings have been held and the three so
| cieties agreed to stand by their agreement.
j Tlie only point remaining to be decided is
the date on which the physicians will
| withdraw from free clinics and lodges.
â¢â¢behind the idea of these free clinics,"
said a leading physipian to-day, "there are
two motives. One is humanity and a will
ingness to assist thp po;>r and needy. This
is ali right and a good thing, but behind
it is the greater motive of self-aggrandize
ment. In many cases people come to the
free clinics who need special attention
j and tne attending physician seeine this
I takes the case in band ani charges a fee
! which goes to his own private account.
''Again, in the practice oi lodges to fur
â  nish medical services there is much that is
wrong. Members pay $2 50 or. some stated
| sum f. year and are assured the attention
oi a physician whenever he is needed.
Tliia is given to a young and inex
perienced man or to one who is not of
enough account to make a living in the
world.
Tbe efforts of the physicians will cer
tainly meet with much exposition. The
AltciÂ«nt, American and Independent
Order of Foresters each has a physician
who receives a certain amount and is at
the call of any sick member. The doctors
are carefully keeping in the background
the names of those who started the move
ment to avoid any individual retaliation.

OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 13.â Word has

the latter went into office. Mrs. Marx
and Miss Drussilla Marx are now in

FIREMEN WILL
HAVE A REUNION
Haywards Company Ar
ranges a Thanksgiving
Eve Ball.
Over Thirty Years Since the
First Run Was Made
to a Fire.
KEEN RIVALRY FOR PHIZES.
All th> Surrounding Towns Will
Help Make the Affair a
Social Success.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Nov. 13. j
Haywards and surrounding towns are
making great preparations for the reunion
of firemen, which is to be held on Thanks
giving eve at Native Eons' Hall.
The leading feature of the reunion will
be a masquerade ball for the benefit of
E. H. DREWS, THOMAS LANE, EX-CHIEF R. KNUDSON,
Chairman Committee of Arrangements. Chief Engineer. Who Will Lead the Exempt*.
These Gentlemen Will Take a Prominent Part in the Haywards
Firemen's Celebration.
Haywards Fire Company 1. It will be the
opening event of the social season for the
interior of the county, and tho interest
shown in it is only a little inferior to that
of last week's election.
Many of the original members of the
fire company will be there only in the
memories of the generation that have
succeeded them.
When the first company was organized
William Hayward, who gave his name to
the town, was one of the most active mem
bers. That was a generation ago and lie,
with many others whose names arecloseiy
interwoven with the history of the county,
have long since closed their records. Many
others who are located in surrounding
counties have been invited to the reunion,
and doubtless it will be the largest gather
ing of fire laddies and their friends ever
seen in trie county.
The arrangements have been placed in
the hands of a committee consisting of
William Pann, John Pann and E. H.
Drew. They have been remarkably suc
cessful in obtaining prizes with which to
stimulate competition among those who
take pride in devising original and hand
some masquerade costumes. Their list
to-nigtit was completed and is as follows:
The best-dressed lady will be given a gold
ring, generously studded with pearls; the
lady with tbe most original costume will
be presented with a silver toilet set; the
most comically dressed lady is to obtain a
silver card- receiver; tbe beat-sustained
juvenile lady character will be given a
silver scbooi set.
The best-dressed gentleman will be
awarded a gold watchchain and locket; he
who can devise the most comical costume
will win a pair of gold cuff buttons, and a
gold ring will be given to the best-sus
tained boy character. There will also be
two valuable door prizes each for ladies
and gentlemen.
Already parties from Alvarado, Mount
Eden, Decolo, Centerville, Paloraares,
Tasajara, Ca->tro Valley, Irvincton, Dub
lin, ban Lorenzo and mauy other little
towns have made Known an intention to
be present, and the eve of Thanksgiving
will be a memorable day.
Th â¢ money realized will be used for the
benefit of firemen who have been disabled
while on duty. During the past few years
there have been some serious fires at Hay
wards and the volunteer brigade have
much good wort to their credit. Some in
juries tiave been received and it is only
by providing benefits that any recom
pense can be awarded. The fire company
po.-sessess one of the most historic and
oldest hand-engines on the coast. Last
Admissiou day they loaned it to the San
Francisco Exempts for tbe Stockton pa
rade, of which it was one of the most in
teresting features.
Chief Engineer Thomas Lane will prob
abiv lead the grand marcli and ex-Chief
11. ivnudson will lead the Exempts.
There are in Haywards many young ladies
who have scored successes at masquerade*
in the paat and they are leaving no stone
unturned to add to their laurels in this
direction. Quite a friendly rivalry al
ready exists among the leaders, of whom
are: Miss Lulu Upboff, Miss Mac Pann,
Miss Ella Horn, Miss Annie May and Miss
Katie Egcert.
This evening the exempt firemen of
Haywards organized a local company.
There are between twenty-five and thirty
five Exempts and they will make the r
first public appearance as a body at the
Ihanksgivin^'-eve "all.

908 Broadway, Nov. 13. I
The Republican Alliance was greatly
encouraged to-day by the assistance it re

Tbis afternoon that gentleman sent tbe
following dispatch to the chairman of
arrangements at Canton in connection
with the Me Kir. ley inauguration:
BAN FRANCISCO, Cal, Nov. 13.â Tne Oak
land Alliance Club, composed entirely of the
picked men of California, numbering 150, rep
resenting in the most comprehensive way the
National spirit of the State, hss arranged to
attend the' inauguration and requests tbe
honor of acting as escort to President-elect
McKinley from Canton to Washington.
As tue victory in this State is the most ere i
ltable of all won, because achieved against the
greatest odds; as the headquarters of '.he club
is In Alarm-da County, which won the S'.ate by
giving 5300 majority, and as the Alliance Is
In my opinion altogether the best uniformed
organization of American civilians at present
in the country, please urge ihe acceptance of

tie California and its brilliant future to the
Republican party. F. X. Schoonmaker.
President Morrow issued tne following
circular to-day:
"ON TO WASHINGTON."
Members of the Republican Allianceâ The
above caption is used in no jocular sense. Tne
trip enn be made, and would not only be a
splendid advertisement but would lend luster
to the Slate of which almost every member
can say. "I am native and to the manner born,"
and which was snatched from the Popocratic
column by the efforts of loyal cit-zuns of our
county.
The money necessary for the trip can be
raised. Your board of directors has already
taken the matter in hand and will unques
tionably succeed.
The question of vital importance is how
many members can and will go? Betier no
trip than an insignificant representation.
Thoroughly concerted action is necessary on
the yrart of all to secure success. We have
made our reputation ana must sustain it. To
that end a general meetinsj of the members ot
the Alliance is hereby called for Saturday
evening, November 14, at headquarters. The
meeting is open to full and free discussion of
the proposed trip, and every memt.er is ex
pected to attend. The trip to Washington de
pends upou you.

Harry 0 Lasted Long Enough to Head
Premata Past the Wireâ Purser's
Perseus Tork a Purse.
There was just a little sunshine for the
"chubbern" or small bettors at Ingleside
yesterday, and several small fortunes were
made on a very little investment.
Trappean, who opened at 30 to 1 in the
betting on the second race of the day and
leisurely strolled backward in the books
until 50 to 1 was freely offered, won with
consummate ease, finishing four lengths
in front of the 6 to 5 favorite Candor.
Those aware of the colt's ability accepted
some of the ring's liberality, and there
was considerable rejoicing among a select
few at the conclusion of the race.
The delightful weather drew out the
largest attendance of the week, with the
exception of "ladies day." The track was
faster and a marked improvement in the
time was noticeable.
Favorites were successful in but two of
the events run. Sport McAllister, al2to 1
sho 1 , who won very cleverly, was the means <
of quite a clean-up by hi* people.
The Spreokels entry, George Palmer,
was a warm 3 to 5 choice for the first
ev-nt, a five and a half mrlong scramble
for two-year-olds, and he barely reached
the coal first. Su--arfoot, who showed h
tremendous reversal of form, led until
within forty yards of the wire, when the
favorite passed him and won by half a
length.
Thirteen platers next started in a six
furlong sprint, with Candor backed down
to 6 to 5 favoritism.
The brown mare set the pace to the head
of the stretch, where Trappean, a rank
outsider, easily overhauled her, and, tak
ing th.* lead, won with something to spare.
Candor was second, three lengths ah ad of
Tenacity.
A five-furlong dash, with the weights
raised twenty pounds above the scale, was
considered a good thing for Bellicoso, who,
carrying 142, was well supported at 4 to 5.
Sport McAllister, with 127 pounds in the
s ddle, jumped out in front at the start
and was never headed, leading the favorite
out by over two lengths in 1:03J4. Cymoor
bolted when the barrier was raised, caus
ing Sir Play and Mount Roy to be virtu
ally left at the post.
H. Martin got one of the second choices,
Harry O, home first in the seven-furlong
run for maidens. Racing a head behind
Sir Philip to the bend for the wire Martin I
sent his mount to the front and in a very !
hard drive beat the 5 to 2 favorite, PrJ
mata, out a half length. Colonel Weight
man was third.
Ed Purser played his gelding, Perseus,
down irom fours to 6 to 5 to pull down the
purse hung up for the final six-furlong
run, and in a drive he crossed the mark a
head in advance of Braw Scot, who
showed an electrical burst of speed
through the stretch. Waiter J was a close
third.
Not?s.
Sugarfoot regained his St. Louis form
very suddenly. On October 30 he finished
last of his field, and apain on November 9
he saw all of the starters head him oat,
the last time beaten eighteen lengths, ac
cording to ihe formbook. Yesterday there
was a very quiet play in the books on him,
and it took George Palmer's life to down
him.
Ed Purser backed his filly Modesiia for
place and show honors in the opening
dash. She finished fourth.
Trappean was sold one year ago at the
PACIFIC COAST JOCKEY CLUB.

Marcus Daly sale of horses in this City for
$150. His dam, L. Trappe. is one oi the
finest-bred matrons at Bluer Root stud,
being a daughter of England's great sire
Hermit.
Duke Stevens at one time looked dan
gerous in yesterday's race, but in the last
furlong grew ugly and fell back to last
position. He can crack watches when
oat galloping alone and some day may
take a r.otion to rap.
Sir R. chard's "pins" are in bad shape
at present and the gray horse is ap
parently a poor investment.
The entry of Cymoor will in future be
refused at Ingleside truck. His bolting
caused Sir Play and Mt. Roy to be left.
Judge Tarn of Stockton looked as pleas
ant at the conclus on of the third race as
President-elect McKinley did when noti
fied ot his election. The Judge backed
Sport McAllister ail around the ring,
cleaning up in the neighborhood of $2000.
It wouid indeed be refreshing to see J.
McGlone make one good ride. He has an
Eastern reputation, but it must have been
attached before he crossed the Rockies.
Lovers of long shots were in clover yes
terday. Some of the books had 1200 to 1
chalkea against Gold Dust.
Coloiiei'Weightman was heavily played
by the paddock crowd in the
fourth event, and at the conclusion of the
run had a vote been cast for the most
popular jockey on the track J. Gardiner
would just about have been snowed in.
His saddle work has not impressed people
out this way very favorably.
It is said that every lime "Bill" Marry
of Cambridge stable fume has a horse en
tered that is strung up to concert pitch
the animal is muzzled, the muzzle is
locked with a patent key and the Key
goes in William's right boot. Yesterday
Murry had occasion to pet a troublesome
bunion and removed his boots. In pulling
them on again he not the right one on the
left foot and vice versa. Time came to
get Perseus ready, and Bill, fueling in the
right boot, rould not find .he key. There
was great consternation in Cambridge
stable neighborhood until a stable-boy
asked the portly trainer how his feet be
came twisted, and then the key was found.
The secret in now out, and hereafter the
touts will inhabit the reeion of the stable to
discover whether or not that patent muz
zle fits on the horses' face.
Tampa was cut off at the head of the
stretch by Perseus, but was evidently
beaten at the time of tlie occurrence. She
should run better next time out.
Phil Archibald was fortunate enough to

board of trustees was elected : J. P. Edoff,
E. K. Lilientha), WiJliam Alis. J. IL

field Scott, secretary; George W. Baker,

Plans for the future were discussed, but
nothing more definite was done than to

ciation not to seek legislation of any kind,
but to simply follow its past course of
standing on the defensive against any
hostile legislation, with the object of pro
tecting the business Interests of the liquor
people.
Not Yet Identified.
Dozens of people yesterday called at the
Morgue to view the Dody of the unknown
young man who recently committed suicide
at Point Lobos on the ocean beach. No one
was able to identify the remains. The only
mark or printing about the young man was
the store mark oi Louuian & Co. of Los An
geles. Unless reeoenized very soon the body
will be consigned to the potters' field.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1896.
GRAND JURY AFTER
ABANDONED TRACKS
Determined That Disused
Rails Shall Be
Removed.
This Measure to Be Enforced
Under Pain of Forieiture
ot Franchise.
JUDGE CAMPBELL VINDICATED
Active Committee Work to Prepare
for the Final R port on De
cember I.
The Grand Jury yesterday afternoon in
vestigated the charges pr ferred against
Police Judge' Campbell and exonerated
him. It A-as charged by A. L. Burrough,
Terrence Fagan and William Miller that
the Judge permitted his political aspira
tions to influence his course as a judicial
officer. The essential point of the com
plaint was that a warrant for L. H.
Cohen's arrest was not served until after
election, although it was sworn out some
time before election day. The complain
ants were heard by tue jury and then
Judge Campbell was called in. He con
vinced the members of the Grand jury
that the warrant was not sworn out on a
square proposition, and offered to produce
a witness to prove that an offer had been
made by his accusers to settle the case
with Cohen ' for $68. which the latter- de
clined to pay.
In speaKing of the exoneration, Fred
erick Jtiobbs, loreman, said it was fully
merited. The fact was taken into consid
eration that the Judg had sometimes as
many as one hundred cases a day to dis
pose of. In th's, particular case it was
shown that the warrant was issued a sec
ond time, that Cohen surrendered him
self, and when the case was called no one
appeared to prosecute him.
Police Juoge Con lan may be called be
fore the jury next Tue>dÂ»y to explain some
remarkable delay in the case of the People
vs. Nathan. Attorney Lowentbal has the
case in hand for his client, Mr. Lubeck.
Early la October Lubeck was hit on the
head with a revolver. His assailant was
arrested, but the case lias been postponed
so often in Judge Conlan's court that the
attention of the Grand Jury has been di
rected to ttie delay.
The Grand Jury expected yesterday aft
ernoon to receive a visit from the Super
visors constituting the Street Committee.
It is tne purpose of the jury. to make some
inquiry regarding the condition of the
streets and, therefore, a conference with
the Supervisors was sought.
H. T. Creswell, City and County At
torney, appeared before the Grand Jury at
the request of that body. The subject of
the interview related to non-used railroad
tracks on the public street*. On many of
ths abandoned horsecar lines in this City
the old rails remain to obstruct travel and
disfigure the streets. Obvious the cor-
P 1 rations fancy that a franchise may be
perpetuated or some other, rights pre
served by keeping rails on the unused
tracks. The Grand Jury evidently intends
that the rails of abandoned roads shall be
removed. . In regard to the forfeiture of
franchises for non-use of roads, Attorney
Creswell advised the jury that judicial
proceedings would be required. The Grand
Jury may have entertained the not'on that
the Supervisors, bavin? authority to grant
or sell a franchise, could revoke the grant
or sale at their pleasure.
There will be a special meeting of â¢ the
Grand Jury next Wednesday evening to
consider this subject and other matters
pertaining to the public streets.
The committees of the jury have been
very active during the past week. . Much
material has already been collected for the
final report, which will "probably be sub
mitted to Presiding Judge Slack as early
as December .1. Robert Hi sht, William
F. Man and George Jones have visited the
Po ice Department, police patrol and City
Prison; W. L. A-he, Harry W.Goodall
and E. P. Famsworth recently paid a visit
to Golden Gate Park; E. P. Far worth,
W. L. Asheand D. B. Jf'aktor have taken
observations concerning the management
of the Fire Department; H. S. Hagan, J.
Ross Jackson and E. P. Farnsworth will
have something to say in the report
touching the manner of conducting the
public schools-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H

Mm. Knight Say* Her Former Husband
Grievously Deceived lier.
Mrs. Roso Knight, residing in New York
City, has filed a suit against A. H. Lough
borough, as executor of the will of Victor
H. Masson deceased, for a share of the es
tate of Masson. In her complaint Mrs.
Masson, who is now the wife of Ed Knight,
the opera-singer, sets fortli that she was
Masson's wife until November 11, 1876,
when she obtained a divorce; that she did
not understand the English language and
that Masson dec ivpd her as to the amount
of the community property ; that the court
adjudged her to bo entitled to eleven
twentieths of such community property,
which Masyon made her believe amounted
to only $500, whereas in fact it was worth
$75,000. She now asks that tne executor
be ordered by the court to pay to her the
rightful share to which Â«he is entitle I.

The Historic Buildings on Jackson Street, Between Sansome and Battery, That Are to Be Destroyed by the Board of Health*
WILL BE MISSED
BY OLD-TIMERS
Buildings Erected in Pio
neer Days Under
the Ban.
Further Condemnations Decided
On by the Board of
Health.
SHIPPED ABOUND THE HOEN.
Hovels on J.ckson Street Between
San some and Battery Doomed
to Destruction.
The official ax of the Health Depart
ment has fallen on a block of the oldest
buildings in this City, and unless legal
measures interpose within the next ten
days the axes of the employes of the
board will raze them to the ground.
No action was taken at the time, prob
ably because election was coming on, but
at a special meeiine of tbe board held yes
terday the edict went forth and the fate of
a number of historical structures was
sealed.
When tho question of further condem
nations came up Assistant Secretary
Zobel, who officiated in the abs- nee of
Secretary Godchaux, read a list of build
ings that had been found unlit for human
habitation as ioilows:
Two-story wooden building at 809 Stockton
street, one-story wooden building at 811 St< ck
ton str-et, one-story wooden buildings at 629
and 631 Pacific street, three-story wooden
building at 823 and B^3;^ Hay street, two
story wooden building at 825 and 827 Clay
street, three-story brick building at 720 Stock
ton street, one-story wooden buildings at 713
and 715 Stockton street, three-story wooden
building at 534 Vailejo street, three-story
wooden building at 807 and BO7JÂ£ Ciay street,
the one-story wooden buiidingb from 300 to
314 nnd iroji 414 to 428 Jackson street, o::e
-story wooden building at 718 Stockton street,
two-story wooden building ai 633 and 635 Pa
cific street.
The buildings from 414 to 428 Jackson
street excited the most interest, for they
have stood in the self-same place since the
days of tbe argonauts, and S';me of them
are closely identified with the history of
San Francisco.
Captain John Bermingbam, United
States Supervising Inspector of Steam
ships, remembers the time when the
waters of the bay wa-hed over the place
wlieie the old buildings now stand. He
said :
Along in June, 1850, I used to discharge
freight from lighters on the beach, at whÂ»t la
now the northwest corner of Sansome and
Jackson streets. The bay used to round in
ihere, covering ali the ground where these old
buildings Â«re. 1 killed a sLark one Sunday
right about where Sausomc and J> cfcson streets
now cross. The Day wus uu so :ar then that
you couldn't come <io.wn Saneome street nnd
get into Jackson withou'. passing through
God alley.
The whole northwest corner of Sansome and
Jackson streets was under water. During the
nextfour months they i egar. tilling In and
piles were driven out along Jackson street.
Then that corrugated iron bu. Ming was put
up. There was a sidewali over th" water Jeacs
lnir to it from Pai:~oine street. Tho bui nine
was completed mortlr befora August 24, 1850,
for 1 remember thai "on tnat day 1 sailed lor
Pruama in the Steamship Be public
There was ii siairway ut the corner of Bat
tery and Jackson streets 1> a'ling down to the
water, and that is where 1 cot in a rowboat to
be taken out to tlie steamer.
On the west corner of the block in those days
Oliver Charlick had rd office and was agent
for Law's line of steamships to New York.
That was in '50 anci early in '51. Afterward
Hoialling had a liquor-store there.
THE COMING CARNIVAL

SCRATCH
AND
SCREAM
My baby broke out with a raab. He â would
â¢cratch aud scream. It would take two to hold
him, and one to put medicine on him. We had
to hold him sometimes an boor before we could
get him quiet, d down. All said that they never
â¢aw auch a face or body on nny baby as on him.
I had to tie hia hands tight in'a cloth, night and
day, for five months. My aiater had uaed CUTI-

application, he lay down, and tlrpi as he had not

as any baby While he had this disease I hud to
cut the sleeves out of his clothes, and put gauze
underwear on him to keep him cool. I had to
keep pieces of soft cloth aronnd his neck. It was

SHE LIKED TO BET.
Two Racetrack Touts Knew It, Took
Her In, aid Were Taken In
Themselves. -
Miss Lyons, whose tirst name ranges all
the way from Amy to Zella among her
friends, is an inveterate visitor at the ln
gleside racetrack. She wagers small sums
o! money at times upon the races and the
touts know that.
Last Wednesday one of the touts named
Arthur Deoriner approached the young
woman and told her his friend Lawless,
whom he introduced, was to ride Governor
Build and would "pull" him. Lawless
then advised her to put $20 up on Gold
Dust, another horse in the race and who
was sure to be a winner. She handed
tlie coin to tbe boys and they subse
quently brought her a ticket marked
"Gold Dust," but which proved to be
bogus. Governor Budd won tlie race, but
the woman realized that she had been
swindled and reported the case to the
police. Detective Graham has manag d
to land both the touts in jail on a charge
of petty larceny.
TESTING POWDER.
Two Shots From the Xi X 12-Inch Gun
to Experiment on the " ;ni;i
Cruz Article.
Tests of Santa Cruz powder were made
yesterday afternoon with the 12-inch
breech-loading rifle on the hill above Fort
Point. Two shots were fired and the
velocity of each projectile was measured
by the magnet.

the projectiles passed were braced this

time so as to withstand the blast of the
tremendous explosion.
In the first experiment 490 pounds of
powder were used. This had explosive
force sufficient to give the projectile,
weighing 1000 pounds, an initial velocity
of 2100 feet per second. The pressure or
recoil, however, exceeded the iimit fixed
by the ordnance corps. In the second
test the charge of powder was reduced to
465 pounds. The required velocity of 2000
ieet per second was secured with an excess
of 60 feet, and the pressure was not greater
than that allowed. The experiment was
so highly successful that a third test was
deemed unnecessary.
The United States ordnance officers have
established a certain grade of powder for
use in the 12-inch breech-loading guns,
and powder-makers on the Atlantic and
PacihOvCoasts have been asked to meet
Government requirements. It is regarded
as a happy evect that the managers of
the Sunta C;uz Powder Work â¢> have shown
their ability to produce powder of the re
quired grade.

THE SAN FBANCTSCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14. 1896.
FIGHTING FOR
THE CONTRACT
Mr. Dey Does Not Think
It Is Relevant to
the Case.
A Lharp Fight to Be Made ior
the Paper This Morning
in Court.
IT IS A PEIVATE EECOED.
Argument Will Be Maie on Both
Sides of This Interesting Case
by the Counsel.
Another tableau was added yesterday to
the prologue in the Fair will contest in
the matter of the production of the $500,
-000 contract in the hands of Richard Dey.
Attorney F. B. Brittain, representing Del
mas & Shortridge, George A. Knight,
Charles J. Keggerty and R-Ã¼ben H. Lloyd
appeared before Judge Slack at the open
ing of court to hear the order of court in
the matter.
As soon as Judge Slack had taken his
seat he announced, without further for
mality, that he would order Mr. Dey to
produce the contract at 2 p. m. for the in
spection of the court.
Mr. Dey was present at 2 o'clock with
Reuben H. Lloyd. Garret W. McEnerney
and Mr. Briitain were also present. At
the request of the court all the parties re-
paired to the Judge's chambers, where a
consultation was held.
Mr. Dey protested against an inspection
of the contract.
Mr. Lloyd contended that it was a pri
vate paper, and had nothing whatever to
do with the case. Tlie court had no more
right to compel Mr. Dey to allow it to be
inspected than he had to order his pri
vate books of account to be made public
Mr. McEnerney tooK a similar view of
the matter. In the first place, he argued,
it was a private record, and in the sec
ond placit it had not been shown to be
relevant to the issues befcre the court.
Judge Slack remarked that he was ig
norant of the contents of the paper, and
therefore could not say whether it was
relevant or not.
Juiipe Slack finally put off the matter
until 11 o'clock this morning, when he
will hear the argument upon it.
Three Judges 111.
Judge Bahrs of the Superior Court li con
fined to his home by an attack of bronchitis.
He has not been able to preside over his court
since last Monday.
Judge Hebbard has been ill for several days
and has continued all cases on his calendar to

pear in court before that date.
Judge John Hunt is not feeling well, and is
talcing a few days' rest to recuDerate his health.
The Prison Yawns for Berrato.
Angeio Berrato, well known as a property
owner In this City, is ia danger of got >g to
prison. Mr. Berrato sued his wife Delia ior a
divorce, whereupon she applied for $50 ali
mony, as is the usual custom in sucb cases In
Judge Dalngerfield'a court yesterda Berrato
â¢Â»ia that he was not able to pay the money,
but from the proof in the case the court took a
diff-rent view and directed that Berrnto shall
be required to produce the money by 10 o'clock
next Monday morning or be locked up in the
County Jail until he does pay.

CHECKING IPHTHERIA
Those Exponj(i to Contagion Are to Be
Excluded From the Schools.
One of the obj-cts of a special meeting
of the Board of Health held ye-terday was
to take step 3to prevent the further spread
of diphtheria, which, during the past forty
days haa made alarming progress, partic
ularly in tbe Mission.
Parenrs are ordered to exclude from
schools all children or other persons be
longing to or residing with or in the same
bouse with persons suffering with diph
theria until the Health Officer certifies
that a period ol thirty days' probation has
ended.
The department has just instructed
Dr. Spencer, the bacteriologist of the
board, to visit all houses where cases are
reported, and even where a mere suspicion
exists, to examine the throat of the pa
tient, and by all the means at his com
mand ascertain whether the case is one of
genuine diphtheria.
The board created tbe position of Bath
and Laundry Inspector and appointed
William Kelly to the place at a salary of
|/5 per month. â¦
Plans for a new two-story addition to
the preaent City and County Hospital
building for the bousing of the lepers now
at t c Pesthouse were examined and ap
prove.! and it was decided to recommend
to the Board of Sup-rviaors that they be
acoep.ed. Tbe addition will cost about
$6000.
The present Pesthouse was condemned
and ordered destroyed as soon as the
lepers have been placed in theii new
quarter*.

Took the Imp rsonator to
Jail.
Mrs. Augusta Hemphill, wife of Charles
Hemphill, masqueraded in malo attire
early yesterday morning for the purpose
of watching her husband, who keeps a
saloon at 533 Sacramento street. She left
her home. 605 Pine street, and her six
children, and called at the liquor-store.
She battered a woman whom she found in
the place, and for this she was arrested.
Now she repents.
Mr. Hemphill was engaged later than
usual in his saloon, and when he did not
return as soon as his wife expected she
donned a suit of his clothes and started
out to reconnoiter. She wore a pair of
gray trousers, nicely creased, a brown
overcoat many times too large and a black
hat.
She reached her destination without
event and took a seat in tbe saloon. Her
husband saw her, but did not recognize in
the chic-looking "man" the features of
bis wife.
Time to close came round at last and
everything appeared serene until an un
known woman put in an appearance and
called Mr. Hemphill by his first name.
This angered the wife and in true pugil
istic style she started in to batter the un
known.
The excitement attracted the attention
of Police Officer Funong, and when lie
arrived at the t<cene the woman disclosed
her identity. He placed her under arrest,
and booked her at the California-street
station. Hemphill followed his wiie to
the station and promptly advanced the
necessary bail, and Mrs. Hempiiill was
released. The woman who caused the
trouble disappeared, and has not since
made her appearance around tbe saloon
where she was chastised at the nands of
the angry wife.
