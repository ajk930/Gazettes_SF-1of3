BRYAN'S PAY FOR
SILVER SPEECHES
Senator Thurston Replies
to Senator Stewart's
Attack.
SILENCE OF AN ORATOR
Democracy's Leader Has Not
Denied That He Was Hired
by Mine-Owners.
REASON FOR HIS MUTENESS
Direct Charges Made by Democratic
Newspapers Permitted to Go
Unreluted.
OMAHA, Nebb., Au^. 16. â Senator
Thurston has sent to Senator Stewart of
Nevada the following open letter:
To Hon. William if. Stewart, Washington D. Câ
Sir: On return from recent campaign tour 1
find your open letter ol August 1, which you
co kindly gave to the press of the country be
fore awaiting ita receipt by me.
In your letter you refer to the address deliv
ered by me at the Chautauqua Assembly at
Madison, Wis., on July 3. You must have
known when you penned your letter that I did
not make any charge against Hon. William J.
Bryan of any kind whatever; that I did noth
ing except to read portions of an editorial pub
lished :n tbe greatest Democratic journal of
the West, the Chicago Chronicle, on the 11th
of last July. The editorial read by me is as
follows :
"There was a time when the owners of the
big bonanzas of the far West were glad
to occupy by purchase seats in the United
States Senate.
"Sharon, Stanford, Fair, Jones, Stewart and
others gratified their fancy in this manner
until the novelty wore off, and then they dei>u
tized attorneys and other employes to take
their plnces and vote for protective tariffs and
free silver.
"Of late years, owing to the encouragement
that they have received from the Republican
party, which 'always does something for sil
ver' when it passes a tariff bill, the proprie
tors of the big bonanzas have found it profit
able to keep a laree number of orators, lectur
ers and other spokesmen on the road preach
ing to the people already limping as a result
of bites by the free-silver cur, the sovereign
remedy of applying the hair of the dog to the
wound.
"Among the many who have been thus em
ployed and carried on the payrolls of the big
bonanzas for a number of yeart is William J.
Bryan of Nebraska. Tbe paid agent and
spokesman ior the free-silver combine, he has
not since his retirement from Congress had
any other visible means of support."
I did not, directly or indirectly, even express
an opinion as to the truth or falsity of the
charge thus clearly, explicitly, unequivocally
and editorially made by a great Democratic
newspaper, reputable and responsible. I did
say, and I still say, "that the man posineas
the advocate of the downtrodden masses of
his countryâ the man holding; a crown of
thorns in one hand and the bugaboo, a cross
of gold, in the other â owes it as a duty to
every man, woman and child in this country
to say whether that charge, thus publicly and
deliberately made, is false or true."
Now, my dettr Senator, you must have
known, and you did know, when you indited
your open letter to me, that the charge was
not mine; no, not even by adopuon; that I
had not even expressed an opinion with re
spect to it, and that I no more than fulfilled
my duty as a citizen in insisting that Mr.
Bryan should tell the American people whether
or not the charge made by the Chicago Chron
icle was true.
One word from Mr. Bryan on the 12th day
of last July would have set the public right;
one word from him on any day since that time
would have accomplished the same purpose.
The charge thus editorially made by the
Chronicle while the Chicago convention was
still in session was reproduced in many of the
leading journals of the country: it came to
the attention ol Mr. Bryan's own paper, the
Omaha World-Herald, of which he was at the
time editor-in-chief, and the only reference
ever made to it in that paper was on the 15th
day of July, when in its editorial column ap
peared the following under the caption "In
Whose Pay?":
'â¢The Chicago Chronicie wants Mr. Bryan to
explain in whose pay he has been since he
was dropped out of Congress.â Sioux City
Journal.
"Mr. Bryan did not drop out of Congressâ he
stepped out â but he has been in the employ of
the World-Herald and it is generally conceded
that he has fully earned his salary."
The press dispatches from Lincoln, Nebr.,
show that Mr. B/yai was asked on the first
day of August to make such answer as he
might desire to the charge of the Chronicle,
as read by me at Madison, and the press re
port iÂ« to the effect that Mr. Bryan had noth
ing to say, except that he would answer in due
time and manner.
In a recent issue of the Chicago Post,
another prominent, responsible and reputable
journal, I find the statement that Mr. Bryan's
stated salary from the silver-mine owners, or
the Silver L-ague, was $6000 per annum, paid
to him in monthly checks, which went
through the Lincoln banks.
Then Mr . Thurston quotes an article in
a recent issue of the Philadelphia Ledger,
written by Major John M. Carson, in
which that gentleman says that in 1892,
wben Mr. Bryan was a candidate for re
election to Congress from the First Dis
trict of Nebraska, he was materially as
sisted in tbe i xpenses of his campaign by
donations from Denver, Colo., which
funds, he sai i. were placed in the hands
of the chairman of tbe Congressional
committee. Judge Broady, and announces
that as a result Mr. Bryan was elected by
a majority of 140 votes, and more than re
paid during the Fifty-third Congress the
money expended in his behalf.
Continuing, Senator Thurston says:
These are only a few of the direct and posi
tive charges of a similar kind which have ap
peared from time to time in thÂ» most reputa
ble and responsible newspapers of the United
States.
I would be the last man in the world to
assail the character of Mr. Bryan. I have not
done bo in any In.Uf.nce or by any word of
mine. Mr. Bryan is a candidate of a great
party. It is not just to the American people
that charges of this kind should go un
answered. He is the man and the only man
who can mcke definite and conclusive answer.
Mr. Thurston suggests that Senator
Stewart turn his batteries "upon those
reputable editors and newspapers making
tbe charge?-." In conclusion he says:
The American people, however, can best
judge as to whether or not tlic contributions
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
for the circulation of silver literature have
been small if you will submit a detailed ac
cnunt, and as you say that these organiza
tionsâreferring to the American Bimetallic
League and American Bimetallic Unionâ for
which you stand as sponsor, can account for
all the money received and tne use maae of it,
I hope you will no longer delay in publishing
your itemized balance sheet. I have no doubt
it would be very interesting reading and be
greatly appreciated by a waiting public.
Permit me to suggest, in conclusion, that I
know of no possible reason why the Bimetallic
Union and its contributors should not employ
orators or distribute literature. I concede
that employment by your union is honorable,
providing it is open and avowed, so that tbe
peopie whose interests are bo vitally at stake
may know in whose behalf they are ap
pealed to.
I now bope, my dear sir, that you will frankly
acknowledge the undue haste and stupidity
â¢with which you have misrepresented me in
thit. matter, and I sincerely trust that you will
immediately transfer to that great Democratic
journal, the Chicago Chronicle, the honor of
an opportunity to substantiate its editorial.
BREAN'S FLBASAXT SABBATH.
Goes to Church and Visits Historic Scenes
at Tarrytounif X. t.
TARRYTOWN, N. V., Aug. 16.â The
brip-hter side of a candidate's life was ex
perienced by Hon. William J. Bryan to
day. He had, perhaps, the pleasantest
Sunday since his nomination. In company
with General Samuel A. Thomas, the New
York capitalist and prominent Repub
lican, Mr. and Mrs. Bryan attended divine
services this morning at the First Presby
terian church in Irvington. 0. J. Smith
took the nominee driving in the afternoon.
Mrs. Bryan, Mrs. Smitb and Mrs. Sewali
were in the party. They visited scenes of
historic and legendary interest in Tarry
town and vicinity, including the bridge
where, according to Washington Irving,
the headless horseman threw his skull at
Ich&bod Crane. They alighted at Sleepy
Hollow Cemetery and visited the grave of
Washington Irving.
In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Bryan and
Mr. Sewall, John Brisbin Walker bad as
guests at dinner this evening Albert Shaw,
editor of tbe Review of Reviews, whose
summer residence is at Irvington, and
W. R. Hearst. Several friends and neigh
bors of Mr. Walker called on Mr. Bryan
and Mr. Sewall to-day.
Part of the journey to-morrow to Upper
Red Hook, the place where Mr. Bryan will
write his letter of acceptance, will be made
by boat up the Hudson. If it can be so
arranged the Poughkeepsie boat will stop
at Irvington for Mr. Bryan and his party,
and the trip as far as Pougbkeepsie will
be made by that means. Otherwise the
party will board it at Yonkers. The boat
is due ai Irvington about 9:30 A. M.
Mr. Bryan confirmed to-day the dis
patches from St. Louis and Baltimore that
he had promised to speak at those places,
but said the dates bad not been fixed.
Mr. Bryan stated that he is not yet ready
to give out his itinerary for the campaign.
ARKANSAS POPULISTS.
Possibility That They Will Xot Support
Bryan for the Presidency.
LITTLE ROCK. Ark., Aug. 16.â The
Populist State Central Committee will
meet in this city to-morrow to consider
the September election. The Arkansas
Populisms may conclude not to support
Brvan, and may substitute the name of
Norton of Illinois. An address just issued
by the State committee is as follows:
We call special attention to the People's
party nominees for Presidential electors.
These electors, ii elected, will vote for the
People's party candidate for President and for
Thomas E. Watson for Vice-President. The
old party leaders are doing all in their power
to disintegrate the People's party by false re
ports. We are glad to say that they are not
succeeding, but, on the contrary, nearly all
the silver Republicans have come to the Peo
ple's party and are attending their conven
tions.
Thousands of Democrats declare they will
support Bryan and Watson electors. They
much prefer Watson to Sewall. The commit
tee nrges the party to give earnest support to
our National, State and local tickets. There is
nothing In the situation that is discouraging,
but, on tne contrary, mucn to encourage.

ENGLAND AND THE TRANSVAAL
Chamberlain Attaches No Importance to the
News About a New Treatyâ Rhodes
to Testify.
LONDON, Eng., Aug. 16.â Joseph Cham
berlain, Secretary of State for the Col
onies, was questioned to-day regarding
the statement made by the Sunday Sun to
the effect that the Transvaal had entered
into a treaty with a foreign power, con
trary to tbe An^lo-Boer treaty of 1888,
and that Great Britain had demanded an
explanation from the Boer Government-
Mr. Chamberlain said the Colonial Office
did not attach importance to the news. '
Mr. Chamberlain will invite Cecil
Rhodes to testify before the Parliamentary
committee appointed to inquire into the
administration of the British South
Africa Company and into the origin of the
incursion into the Transvaal by an armed
force. Mr. Rhodes will probably be the
first witness.

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, AUGUST 17, 1896.
SLEW HIMSELF TO
PLACATE WEYLER,
General Ochando's Nephew
Compelled to Commit
Suicide.
ACCUSED OF TREACHERY
Given the Choice of Death by
His Own Hands or an
Execution.
HIS UNCLE SEEKS REVENGE.
A Duel With tbe Butcher in His
Palace Prevented by Other
Officers.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 18.-A dis
patch to the Recorder, from Havana,
says: Captain-General Weyler and Gen
eral Ochando were tbe principals in a
sensational affair which occurred shortly
before the latter sailed for Spain.
It seems that the death of General
Ochando's nephew, who was a lieutenant
in the Spanish army, was the cause of the
trouble. There were ugly rumors in cir
culation reflecting on the young lieuten
ant. It was alleged that he was conduct
ing a treasonable correspondence with
Maximo Gomez, the insurgent chief.
When Weyler heard of the rumors he
summoned the young man to the palace
arid questioned him. Weyler was ap
parently satisfied of the young man's
guilt and told him if he did not
commit suicide within twenty-four hours
he would be court-martialea and shot.
The lieutenant left the palace, went to
his room, and in six hours wad a corpse,
having shot himself through the heart.
Shortly afterward General Ochando ar
rived in Havana and learned the true
story of his nephew's deatb. Ochando
was greatly enraged, and immediately
went to the palace to call Weyler to ac
count.
The meeting of the generals was sensa
tional. Ochando denounced Weyler in
the bitterest terms, alleging that the lieu
tenant was guiltless and had been driven
to his death. Ochando teimed Weyler a
murderer and butcher, and challenged him
to a duel.
Both men drew swords, and would have
fought in tbe palace but for the interfer
ence of otber officials.
Two days later General Ochando sailed
for Europe. He is greatly enraged, and
says that he will make the affair public
when be reaches Spain and demand Wey
ler's recall.

SAVANNAH, Ga., Aug. 16.â A special
to the Morning News from Brunswick,

coast of the Brunswick customs district.
Smoke from a large steamer was seen
about noon by visitors to St. Simon Island,
and later the shape of a large vessel, gen
erally supposed to be the Spanish cruiser
Alfonso, was discerned. From the fact
that it is not positively known whether
the Brunswick tug Dauntless made her
escape to aea with the expedition which

morning last the interest created by the
appearance of this warship is thrilling and
causes mucn excitement.

Four Hundred and Sixty Funer
als in Tnat City and 200
in Brooklyn.
Heat Victims Are So Numerous That

burials than any seven da.ys of which
cemetery book-keepers can rind recorded.
Of tbe 1810 persons who died in this city
last week nearly 500 died Thursday ni^ht,
Friday and Saturday. Because of the
difficulty in securinu caskets, hearses and
carriages, or even undertakers' service be
yond the simple and most necessary,
nearly all the funerals for that period were
delayed until to-day.
Thirty-six hearses were borrowed from
adjoining towns in New Jersey, and
twelve from Philadelphia for to-day, and
several NiW York undertakers, whose
rush was over, loaned hearses to Brooklyn
friends. Other hearse* were added "to
Brooklyn's supply from Long Island
towns, as there were nearly one-fourth of
the week's 876 dead in that city still un
buried.
At the cemeteries the crowds of visitors
were enormous and the tolling of the gate
bells continuous. So many graves had
been called for that the force of nearly 300
men at Calvary bad been increased by
over 100 diggers, and the entire number
worked night and day.
All day Father Costello stood in the
chapel at Holy Cross and pronounced the
benediction of tbe dead. The funeral
trains also approached the chapel in
double lines, the hearses massed around
the entrance, where bearers waited with
burdens and the weeping relatives until
tbeir turn came to enter.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
LOST IN SETTLE
MOUNTAIN WILDS,
A Four -Year -Old Child
Wanders for Six Days
Alone.
SUBSISTS ON BERRIES.
Each Night Tiny Hands Prepare
a Couch Beneath the
Giant Oaks.
FOUND AFTER A LONG SEARCH.
Rescued Unharmed From Forest Stamp
ing Grounds of Bear and
Cougar.
PENDLETON, Ok., Aug. 16,-For six
days four-year-old Emma Nelson of Su
sanville wandered alone on a mountain
where the roar of the bear and screams
of the panther Â»re beard nightly. On six:
evenings, as the sun disappeared
in the west, she made a couch beneath
some giant oak and lay down to sleep, the
awful noises of the forest sounding in her
ears a wild lullaby.
The little one is safe at home now, found
and returned after a weary search by
scores of men in the mountains; and that
she was spared from death is regarded by
the simple mountain folk as miraculous.
Verily, there is One who watches over the
weakest of his flock.
Little Emma is a rosy-cheeked miss,
with bright blue eyes and dimpled hands
and chin. She lives with her parents at
Susanville. Her papa is the village post
master.
Not far from the little one's humble
home are the stately, snow-capped Blue
Mountains. From the summits of snow
of the highest peaks the view is enchant
ing and extends into three States. Off to
the north is Washington, to the east
Idaho and all around Oregon. Away to
the north the great Columbia River winds
itself like a silvery thread, now through
fertile valleys and now through Bandy
wastes, where sandstorms strong enough,
to interfere with railroad traffic sometimes
occur.
The country is of a wild aspect, and the
mountain fastnesses hold many a secret
of the doings of Indians in days ions
passed, of prospectors who never returned
to their homes, and of cattle- thieves who
were dealt with according to the primi
tive law of the land.
The people of Susanville gave a picnic
over a week ago in a grove in the foothills
of the Blue Mountains. It did not differ
from other picnics. There were sports for
the children and lots of good thing3toeat,
and the simple mountain people had a
merry day of it. When the people were
ready to start for home little Emma was
nowhere to be found. There was no trace
of her from early in the afternoon, when
her six-year-old brother saw her going in
the direction of Settle Mountain, gather
ing wild flowers as she went. "Settle
Mountain 1" exclaimed the country folk
in horror. It is the most dangerous peak
in the entire range and is the stamping
ground of bears and cougars.
"She'll never be found alive," was the
verdict of tbe hardy mountaineers as they
shook their beads doubtfully.
All that night and for several days and
nights afterward men searched the moun
tain fastnesses for the lost one. Their
hearts failed within them when the still
ness of the night was broken by tbe
vicious growl of the cougar, and when in
daytime they saw numerous bears feeding
at the berry bushes. In the afternoon of
the sixth day the searching party came
upon a clump of weeping willows, by
which passed a small stream. Not one of
the searchers had the slightest idea of
finding the little one alive. Little Willie
was riding in front of his father on a
horse, which was accustomed to rough
trips in the mountains.
"Papa, 1 - 1 said the boy, "if my Jittle sis
ter isn't dead, 1 ttiink she is not far from
that stream. She loves to sit near the
river and make bouquets of the wild flow
ers that she gamers."
As the party neared the clump of brush
Mr. Nelson was startled to hear a voice
Â»ay: "Hello, papa: 1 have been looking
for you eÂ»er so long.
Mr. Nelson clasped his child in his arms
ami hugged her as no father ever hugged
a child before.
"I knew I was lost, papa,'* the little
one said, "but I was so sure I would meet
my papa that I kept on walking."
Emma told tbe searchers that she had
made a complete circuit of Settie Moun
tain, having traveled nine miles. How
she escaped the cougars and bears is a
mystery. She slept wherever she could
find a resting-place and subsisted on
berries and the flesh of a calf which had
been killed by a coyote.
The little girl sail she was frightened
only once while in the mountains. That
was on her third day out. She awoie that
morning on the edge of a precipitous cliff.
The big fir trees in tbe valley a thousand
feet below looked like walking-canes.
Had she made the move during
her sleep she would have rolled off tbe
cliff.

WILL THE CZAR
VISIT BERLIN?
The All-Absorbing Ques
tion at the German
Capital.
ANXIETY AND JEALOUSY
In Cafes and Other Public Piaces
the Subject Is Much
Discussed.
IMPERIAL PARTY'S ITINERARY
Grand Fetes and Military Displays Are
in Preparation at Vienna and
Breslan.
[Copyrighted, 1896, hy thÂ»> Vnited Associated
Presses.]
BERLIN, Germany, Aug. 16.â The ques
tion which is now agitating the minds of
the inhabitants of the German capital is,
Will the Czar come to Berlin? Up to this
time it has merely been officially an
nounced that the Czar and Czarina will
be the guests of the Emperor at Breslau
and Goerlitz, but as Vienna and Paris will
be the scenes of elaborate receptions to the
Russian autocrat and his consort, the Ber
liners are jealously anxious lest the Czar
and Czarina should be slighted here. The
Berlin and provincial newspapers are
variously discussing the question and the
matter is the subject of much argument
in the cafes and other public places. Some
of the newspaper:* in the course of their
articles point out the advantages of Bres
lau as the scene of the reception of the
Czar in Germany, while the otners assume
s pessimistic tone and declare their belief
that it is the intention of the Russian Em
peror to come here, but to give to his visit
an aspect of minor importance as com
pared with his visits to the Austrian and
French capitals.
This sort of thing baa aroused the
leaders of the official circles, as evidenced
by an inspired article in the Cologne
Gazette, which not only sharply rebukes
the grumblers, but is seemingly intended
to give positive intimation to the public
that it is not the intention of Nicholas II
to visit the city of Berlin at all and has
not been from the first. The paper makes
no direct announcement to this effect,
however, and the whole matter probably
awaits the deiinite decision of the Czar.
There has been a prolonged series of
communications between the German and
Russian Cabinets in regard to the sequence
of visits proposed by the Czar, and it is
generally presumed that full and final
arrangements have been concluded. Some
time ago a tentative communication from
a Russian source suggested that the Czar
should make visits to Vienna, Munich
and Darmstadt, prior to his rreeting the
Kaiser, but tbis programme was in no
way acceptaDle to Emperor William, who
Eet the diplomatic Ministers to work to
effect the changes which he desired made
in the Czar's itinerary.
The result of the efforts of diplomacy
was that the Russian Cabinet maintained
their contention that Vienna must take
precedence over the German capital, inas
much as Emperor Franz Josef's was tne
older imperial court, Berlin coming next.
This view of the matter was acquiesced in
by the Emperor, and according to the
existing arrangements the Czar will fatart
from Krasnoe-Selo on August 24, accom
panied by Prince Lobanoff Rostovsky, the
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs;
Count Yorontzoff-Daunbkoff, Chief of the
Ministry of the Imperial House and Im
perial Domains, and six other attendants
of exalted rank.
The customary extreme precaution will
be taken in the matter of guarding the
railroads over which the imperial party
will pass and in protecting bis Majesty at
other points along the route. Upon the
arrival of the Czar at Vienna he will be re
ceived at the station by Emperor Franz
Josef in person, wno will conduct the
Russian Emperor to the Hofburg Palace.
The programme for the entertainment
of the Czar in Vienna includes a grand
state performance of "Manon" at the Im
perial Opera-house, and a concert at the
Hofburg Palace on the following day. Be
fore finally leaving Austria the Czar will
pay a visit to the ex-Queen of Hanover
and the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland
at Gmunden.
The Czar and Czarina will arrive at
Breslau on Septembers, and ihe German
Emperor and Empress, with a brilliant
assemblage of princes and other notabili
ties, will greet them at the station, where
a guard of honor consisting of the Em
peror Alexander of Russia's Grenadiers,
of which the Czar Nicholas II is the chief ,
will await them. This regiment; together
with the Second Regiment oi Dragoon
Guards, of which her Majesty the Czar
ina is the chief, has been ordered to Bres
lau especially for the occasion. In addi
tion to these troops, 14,000 veterans will
form a double line through which the
Czar and Czarina and tneir suites will
pass upon leaving the station.
The two days oi the visit of the Russian
Emperor and Emnress to Breslau will be
largely taken up by military reviews and
parades, in the course of which the Czar
and Czarina will lead their respective
regiments past the Kaiser. A gay per
formance will be given in the theater in
honor of the visitors on the evenihg of
September 6. Among the personages of
note who are expected to assemble at
Breslau to take part in the honors to the
Russian Emperor and Empress are the
King of Saxony; Prince Albrecht, Regent
of Brunswick ; Prince Heinrich ; the Count
of Turin, nephew of King Humbert of
Italy; Prince Albert of Belgium; repre
sentatives of the courts of Bavaria and
Wurtemberg; Captain R. K. Evans, mili
tary attache to the United States em
bassy; attaches to the other foreign em
bassies and legations In Berlin ; the Earl
of Lonsdale and Lord Charles Beresford.
On the iuorn.ing of September 7 all of
the imperial guests will go to Goerlitz,
where there will be more military parades
and maneuvers. On the evening of Sep
tember 7 the Czar and Czarina, with their
suites, will take their departure for Copen
hagen, unless in the meantime it shall be
decided that the Russian imperials visit
Berlin. A suggestion that the three Em
perors meet at Breslau has been quite
seriously discussed, but it is cot probable
tnat such a meeting will take place.
Emperor William on August 2 will at
tend the unveiling of a moment in Berlin
in honor of the Third Regiment of Foot
Guards.
Arrangements are in progress for a
sporting" week in Berlin from September
20 to September 27, upon the lines of the
annual sporting week in Dresden. The
Emperor has been asked to become a
patron of the sports. The programme as
at present contemplated will include a
water corso, a sailing regatta and flat
steeplechase races at Carlshorst, a concours
hippiq'Je on the exnibition grounds and a
battle of flowers, bicycling, athietic sports,
fencing and shooting contests at other
places.
The health of Prince Bismarck, accord
;rÂ« to the Hamburger Naclirictiten, is
now very cood indeed. The ex-Chancel
lor has resumed his former long walks,
and is even meditating a resum ption of
his practice of horsebacK riding.
Military circles are greatiy interested in
the whereabouts of Lieutenant Ahmed
Ilhami Bey, one of the Turkish officers
who was sent to Germany at the expense
of the Porte to learn the methods of the
German military system, who disap
peared. The Ottoman lieutenant got into
trouble with his landlay, whose hueband
brought suit against him in the courts.
The Turkish officer's declarations in court
seem to have involved him in a charge of
perjury, and fearing the result he fled
from Berlin. A warrant has been issued
for his arrest upon the charge of desertion
from the German army.
Henry Dalley of New York, who was
commissioned by the Congress of the
United States to inquire into the German
system of using free alcohol in manu
factures, has completed his investigations
and expresses himself as extremely grati
fied at the assistance he received from the
various German officials with whom he
came in contact. The conclusion arrived
at by Mr. Dalley as the result of his obser
vations is that it will be possible to pro
mote the use of free spirits in manufactur
ing in the United States without defraud
ing the revenues, and at the same time
avoiding tne existing high taxes imposed
upon manufacturers. He finds that those
who claimed that the use of free spirits in
German manufactures was impossible
were greatly mistaken.
Whatever semi-ofticial statements may
be made upon the subject, it will be a very
difficult matter to persuade the public
that the retirement of General Bronsart
yon Schellendorff from tbe Ministry of
War is not connected with the differences
which have arisen between him and Gen
eral yon Hahnke, the chief of the Em
peror's Military Cabinet, over the pro
posed changes in the military code of pro
cedure, which have already been explained
in these dispatches. If the statement
made yesterday that General Schellen
dorff's resignation is not due to the army
reform question be generally accepted fes
true, it will not make a particle of differ
ence to far as the bettnr informed circles
are concerned. The Yon Hahnke Mili
tary Cabinet embodies the eniira opposi
tion to the War Ministry and still controls
the Kaiser's action, consequently Yon
Hahnke's views are likely to prevail.
The departure of General Scheliendorff
from the Ministry strengthens the ex
pectation that Prince Hohenlohe's with*
drawal from the Chancellorship will not
be long delayed after the Czar has con
cluded his visit to Germany, as Prince
Hohenlohe, equally with General Schel
lendorff, is pledged to the Reichstag in
behalf of the reform of the military
courts. It may be, however, that the re
forms will be "temporarily sheived should
an Eastern crisis develop, Prince Hohen
lohe retaining his post until the inter
national situation clears up. It was the
Eaatern complications that caused Prince
Hohenlohe to go to Wilhelmshohe to see
the Kaiser, and upon his return here he
called the membeis of the Cabinet to
Berlin.
Herr Thielen, Minister of Public Works,
was the only member of tne Ministry in
Berlin, the others being absent on their
vacations, but Dr. yon Boetticher, Vice-
President of the Council of Ministers, and
Freiherr Marschall yon Bieberstein, Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, were immediately
summoned to take part in a conference of
the ministers. These members of the Cab
inet will remain in Berlin for the present,
while Prince Hohenlohe, pending the ar
rival of the Czar, has gone to Werki, Rus
sia, with his wife and daughters on pri
vate business.
J. B. Jackson, first secretary of the
United States embassy, Mrs. Jackson and
Miss Ratter are spending a month's holi
day at Beuzeval, France.
After the Silesian maneuvers Captain
Evans, military attache to the United
States embassy, will leave for home. His
departure from Beilin will be greatly re
gretted, as he has made hosts of friends
among the officers of the German army
and others who have had the pleasure of
meeting him.

Threaten to Strike for Eight Hour* and
$3 50 a Day.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 16. -Th
painters threaten to strike to enforce the
payment of the union scale of wages of
$3 50 a day and eight hours' work, and
the strike may begin to-morrow. There
are four or five painters' unions in this
city â the German painters, the operative
painters, the decorative painters and New
York progressive painters â and all arc
controlled by an executive board, which
has issued the order to strike.
The German painters, of whom there
are about 200, are opposed to any strikes
at present, as they say the times are not
propitious for such action, and they have
called upon the executivs board to resign.
DROUGHT IN TEXAS.
The Cotton Crop Will Fall Short 3,000,

DENISON", Tex., Aug. 16.â R. M. King,
the cotton pxpert, and who has a corre
spondence with the entire cotton belt, has
issneo the following bulletin:
In North Texas not over a third of the area
has been visited by rains at all, and it Is safe
to Â«ay not one acre in 100 has had enough to
suthce the present needs of the plant. Kot
withstandiug the recent showers, we do not
hesitate to advance the opinion that the great
"monster" crop of 18<J6 that was to be, has
surely miscarried, and the crop that was sold
In May and June for a 10,000,000 bale crop
will be under 7,000,000 bales, and before the
last of September we will probably dee the bulk
of North. Texas cotton ready for the market if
not aold.

GENERAL FORSYTH'3 ORDERS
Transfers of Horses and Mules From
One Point to Another Must
Cost Nothing.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. IdâUn
usual economy seemg to be exercised jnst
now by military and naval officers. Last
week Assistant Secretary of ths Navy
McAdoo remitted eleven months of the
year's imprisonment which was imposed
upon Machinist Dunphy of the ram
Kathadin, dismissal to follow, on the
ground that it was too expensive to keep
him in prison that long.
General orders just issued by General
Otis, in command of the Department of
the Columbia, seem to show that the same
policy is to be iollowed in tb.e army. Two
soldiers were senteuced to dismissal fol
lowing a year's imprisonment for deser
tion. Reviewing the report of the court
martial, General Otis approves the sen
tence, after reducing the term of imprison
ment to six months.
Similar remission of punishment is also
made by General Forsyth, Department of
California. Orders from the same head
quarters relating to the transfer of horses
and mules from one point to anotner re
quire the transfers to be made without
cost for transportation.
The following order has been issued by

SAMOA NOT A PARADISE,
Americans Advised to Stay
Away From the Distant
Islands.
Ex-Consul-Genera! Mullen Declares
That the Berlin Treaty
I* a Farce.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 16.-The
State Department has resolved to publish
the report of James H. Mullen, ex-Consul
General to Samoa, upon the government,
commerce, products and people of tnat
country, which has hitherto been held as
confidential, and it will appear in the Au
gust volume of Consular Reports now in
press. This report was submitted to the
department in September, 1895, when Mr.
Mnllen resigned his office, and was the
expression of his views after a year's stay
in the country. It is a lengthy document,
comprising nearly 100 printed pages, and
is valuable and interesting from almost
any point of view.
Mr. Mullen explains that one reason for
making the report was the receipt by him
of a large number of letters oi inquiry
from persons in the United States, who,
probably persuaded by roseate and mis
leading reports, expressed themselves as
anxious to leave the United States with
all its opportunities and advantages to
make their homes in these islands, where
they fatuously suppose a living could be
had without exertion and large profits
awaited the application of ordinary in
dustry or enterprise.
As a matter of fact, he says, the ex
pense of living in Samoa is two or three
times as great as in the United States. Of
the workings of the Government under
the treaty the writer says the real merits
of the situation, hazed in conflicting re
ports, biased by divergent interest, viewed
trom widely separated standpoints, is not
to be clearly understood at a distance.
Mr. Mullen reaches the conclusion that
the Berlin treaty is an utter and unre
lieved failure, and that, without surren
dering an iota of American prestige or
right in the islands or failing to maintain
the rights of the people, the United States
"should put an end to an arrangement un
der which a farce is perpetuated from
which no credit ensues.
The report contains abundant informa
tion regarding Samoa and its interests,
some of the figures being rather surpris
ing. Its entire trade m 1894 amounted to
less than $750,000; the total Government
and municipal revenue was less than
$8000, of which thirty-two Americans,
registered at the consulate, paid but $557;
customs duties were $27,500. The popula
tion of the island is estimated at 35.000.
Apia, the principal town, has 826 inhabi
tants and is without a wharf, a public
school, a tire engine or a foot of sidewalk.
EVERETT JAILBREAK.
George A Kline, the St. Louis Murderer,
\ Escapes With the Assistance of a
Confederate.
EVERETT, Wash., Aug. 16.â George A.
Kline wasÂ» arrested here yon Friday night
by City Marshal Getchell on a charge of
having shot and killed a policeman in St.
Louis seven years ago. The arrest was
the result of a long and persistent search,
and was brought about through corre
spondence from the Chief of Police of St.
Louis, who had located Kline on Puget
Sound some three months ago.
Kline had been working at the shingle
mill of Wade & Metcalf, and but a few
months ago was a railroad brakeman on the
Everett and Monte Cristo Railroad, and
was also engaged in switching in the
Northern Pacific yard at Tacoma.
After placing him inside of the cage of
the city lockup Marshal Getchell remained
in his office in the city building until a
few minutes alter 6 o'clock, when he went
out to get supper for his prisoner. He
was gone about an hour, and on his return
unlocked the outside door and called out,
"rielio, George ; here'ssomething to eat."
Receiving no response he glanced
through the bars, but could see no one.
He took his key to unlock the cage door
when he was thunderstruck to find that
the Yale padlock was gone and the bird
had flown.
As the lock is protected from the inside
by a large steel plate it is plain that an
outside confederate must have helped
Kline to escape. The window of the
jailer's room had been raised and the lock
deftly picked.
ASIZONA JUDGE ASSAILED.
Charger Filed Against Territorial Asso
ciate Justice Bethune.
TUCSON, Abiz., Aug. 16.â Another po
litical squabble ia on the tapis. War has
been declared against Judge Bethune of
this district and Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of this Territory.
The fight is managed by W. K. Meade,
United States Marshal, aided by seven
members of tne bar. The ground alleged
is that his state of health incapacitates
Bethune for duty, and publio business is
neglected and suffering.
Bethuiie has been supplied with a copy
of the complaint and has demanded that
an examiner from the Department of Jus
tice be sent here at once to examine into
tbe facts.
The record shows that Bethune has,
during the last two years, disposed of three
times as many cases as did his predecessor
in the two previous years.
A majority of tbe members oi the bar of
this district strongly support Bethune. It
seems to be the general sentiment that if
he is removed his successor should be
appointed fronn outside the Territory, to
insure immunity from petty quarrels of
local politicians.

be desired, and of course the result was
that every tuing went off as merrily as a
marriage bell.
Ceremonies were formally opened at 1
p. m., when Gh. E. Johnson called the
larue party to order. He 6poke of the
order, its objects and its aims, and then
concluded in a happy manner. "I would
ask all our people, be said, "to receive
visitors wno are strangers to us; maÂ«e
them feel at home, so that we shall have a
pleasant time together, one and all."
Late in the afternoon the uniform corps
of the knights entertained the spectators
with an exhibition drill, which evinced
line training. At the close of the drill a
beautiful gold medal was presented to
Captain W. J. Ireland by N. H. Ohlsson on
behalf of the order. Captain Ireland was
an officer in a Pennsylvania regiment In
the War of the Rebellion and it was be
who organized the knights in military
order. For his generous interest and con
stant labor for me knights the medal was
given him as a souvenir oi gratitude.

at 11:30 and proceeded at once to the
shooting park, where an old-fashioned
Spanish barbecue had been prepared for
the visiting teams. At 1 o'clock the cap
tains of the several clubs selected the men
to represent tuem. Umpire Thomas Allen
called time and the clay pigeons com<
menced to fly from the five traps.
The Watsonvilles were the first to take
their places. They did excellent^ work,
and the final defeat oi the team was sur
prising, considering t.-at it had a good
start. Salinas was the next club to shoot,
and it made a poor score. The Garden
City Cyclers' Gun Club was last, but piled
the score so high as to discourage all other
contestants. Anderson, especially, did
stood work, with Dr. Barker a close sec
ond.
The total average score was: San Jose,
first, 185 birds; Monterey, second, 165;
Salinas, third, 158, and Watsonville last,

After the regular shoot Captain Bartlett
of i Los Anueles gave a fine exhibition of
fancy shooting. He used a repeating Win
chester and was very quick. His main
feat was throwing up six clay pigeons into
the air and breaking them before they
touched the ground. Large crowds of
Monterey and Del Monte people attended
the shoot and barbecue.

drew the large crowd. Tbe game as origi
nally arranged to be played would have
been a great farce, as a keg of beer was to
be placed on |tbird base and only those
reaching the tiiird bag were to be entitled
to a drink. When it was decided to play
for the benefit of the Native Sons' fund
the players dropped the farcical side of the
affair and played in earnest. The editorial
and composing-rooms and job offices of
both newspapers were represented on the
team. The public were surprised at the
cleverness of some of tbe stick-wielders,
and while there were some rank plays
made by the teams the list of errors was
not nearly so large as was expected
Lynch of tlie Mail team knocked out a
home run and several two-base hits were
made. Tbe Indeppndent men had three
professional players in their team and the
Mails one, each side hiring a professional
catcher; but the first-named team had
Walters of the Stockton team and Gamble
who used to play professional ball in the
Northwest, in their offices and so had the
best of the game. The Mails proved to be
the best at the bat, but their hits were not
bunched and they did poor work in the
field. In the third inning the Indepen
dents piled up nine runs, which won them
the game. Black and Pace and Pace and
Newell alternated as the battery for the
Mails and Harlin and White were the bat
tory for the Independents. Gamble and
Walters also pitched for the last-named
team.
The runs by innings were:
Independents. 0 0 9 2 4 0 4 3 3â25
Mails 1 0 14 4 3 6 2 0-22

SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 16.â Tony Del
mas, a member of the Garden City Cyclers,
to-day lowered the record over the East
San Jose live-mile course to 12:37. This
beats the former course record of 13:02,
held by John Wing of the Olympic Club,
San Francisco, 25 seconds. Delmas was
paced by four tandems. If the pacing had
been a little better tne time would have
been cut to 12 :30.
The riders of tbe tandorns were Al Baker
and J. D. Lawrence. Roy Johnson and
Edgar Johnson, Gail Hardenbrook and
Julius Smith and Irving Ryder and R. R.
Shearman. The first tandem slowed up a
little too soon at the end of its pace and
Delmas was compelled to go around it,
and the third team rode a couple of miles
on ft fiat tire.
The fire-mile handicap road race of the
Garden City Cyclers was held over the
same course previous to Delmas' ride
against time. The handicapping was good
and the race was hotly contested from
start to finish. Both events were wit
nessed by a large number of spectators.
R. W. Bridgman, with a handicap of
1:30. won the race in 14:20. R. R. John
son (1:45) was second, and R. R. Shear
man (:35) third. Tony Delmas secured
the time prize, riding from scratch in

Camp City Guard, Company 8., )
Fiest Regiment Infantry, >7. G. C. V
Los Gatos, Cal., August 16.)
Right in the center ot Los Gatos the
camp is located. It is only a hundred
yards from the bridge, on Alain street,
which spans Los Gatos Creek. The trees
in the creek bottom are so wide-spreadinE
as to almost shut the camp out from view,
until suddenly the reader finds himself
almost in the midst of it, unless he hap
pens to run up against a sentinel. But
the Company B sentinel in the daytime is
not the terror to the visitor that he be
comes to the prowler or the belated guards
man at night, whereat the large number
of people who looked upon the camp to
day smiled and looted glad.
A more picturesque or advantageous
spot for an encampment couJd not have
been found in a wide stretch of coun
try. It has all the charms of a sylvan
retreat, with ample shade, bright and
frequent spots of sunshine, quiet nooks
offering seclusion when the stars are out
and "the moonlight is floating overall."
Within a stone's throw of the flagstaff are
all the advantages of a live little city,
famous for its beauty. High above the
camp rise the green and cultivated slopes
of the Â£anta Cruz mountains, with their
brown heads in the sky, and ten feet be
low the mess-tables ripples tbe Lob Gatos
Creek, on it way to the sea. Whoever
chose this spot had his eye out for the
beauties of nature on the one hand and
the advantages of civilization on the other.
This was the first day of camp. Tbe
number of visitors was not so large as it
will be to-morrow. About 150 people, in
cluding many ladies, came up on the
trains to-day and are stopping at the
hotels. On entering camp the first thing
tne visitor sees is "old glory" flying in the
breeze at the top of the tali flagstaff and a
brass howitzer, highly polished and glit
tering in the sun. The latter gives the
visitor an impression of business. Can
non nearly aiways project an idea of seri
ous business into ihe mind of the be
holder. When the caller wanders farther
and sees stacks of guns and glittering
bayonets he concludes that the gallant
"boys of the City Guard are not here for
play altogether. And Captain George
Filmer says they are not.
''This is a camp of instruction," he said
to-day. "If you are here at company drill
in the morning you will think so."
There are over 100 men in camp and
about fifty more are expected during the
week. It was impossible for all the mem
bers of the company to get away from
business ior the eight days that the camp
will continue, so those who are now ab
sent will come up for two or three days
later in the week.
The tents number ten. They are pret
liiy pitched facing each other, with a
broad shady avenue running between,
and nearly all have canopies of several
colors over their entrances. The mess j
table is very picturesquely located, and
three times a day it has added charms
that the able-bodied soldier finds it im
possible to resist.
There will be a new countersign each
night. The officers insist that a bottle
will not l ass muster as a subsritute, and
nothinir but the countersign goes. So the
guardhouse is yawning wide open for the
first man who tries to seduce a picket from
the path of his duiy with a flask. It is
not to be supposed that the toys of Com
pany B are loaded with flasks for this or
any other purpose, but it was deemed
wise to have an understanding about the
matter.
Captain George Filmer is m command,
and other officers of Company B on the
ground are: First Lieutenant B. B. Stur
riivant, Second Lieutenant A. F. Ramm i
and First Sergeant W. X. Kelly. Among i
other well-known National Guardsmen !
in camp are Major H. B. Hosmer of Gen
eral Warfieid's staff and Captain A. H.
Williams, late of Colonel Sullivan's staff. I
The company surgeons here are Dr. T. A.
McCuiloch, Dr. W. H. o'Malley and Dr. A.
D. McLean. Major-General James will be
here next Saturday with his staff and Gen
eral Warfieid and staff will be here next
i-riday.
The commissary department of camp
â¢City Guard" is in charge of Quartei
master-sergeant A. H. Clifford, and the field
music is in charge of Sergeant H. Sieberst
(fifes) and Val Mills (drums). The com
pany bugler is Al Aphthorpe, and he will
make the rabbits high above on the hills
lift up thÂ«ir ears and listen.
A prize for the best-decorated and best
kept tent has been offered by Charles
Steiger, an honorary member of the com
pany. It is not known yet what the prize
is, but ot course it is worth having, and
there is quite a rivalry "on the tented
field" to win it.
To-morrow night the members of the
company will give a reception to the peo
ple of lion Gatos. Tnere are signs that it
is going to be a "swell" and a very largely
attended affair. The grounds will be
illuminated. The Los Gatos band of six
teen pieces has been engaged. The name
that the location of tne camp is locally
known oy here is Shore's picnic grounds,
and there is a broad pavilion, which is
]ust ibe thing for dancing. A ball in the
pavilion will be one of the features of the
reception. The gallant, guardsmen and
the fair visitors from San Francisco ana
the lovely maidens of Los Gatos may not
dance "till the stars pale" in the eastern
sky, but doubtless the time for sounding
taps will be forgotten for a gratifying
length of time. Other social features will j
adorn each evening in camp. There will
be a drama before the weeic is out.
The members of Comr>any B are deter
mined to improve themselves as soldiers
in every way while in camp, but after they
have arisen* with the sun and worked hard
in the drill they will seek a recreation that
will doubtless be well-earned.
To-night it was a typical camp scene.
An arc light was swung over the main
avenue and a large bonfire built a little to
one tside of the camp. The soldiers and
a large number of Los Gatos young ladies
gathered around tbe fire. The camp
siring band, composed of two guitars, two
zithers and a violin, made the evening
beautiful with music. The guardsmen
sang sones, and before taps sounded it was
a case of everybody, including the young
ladies, singine in the red glare under the
trees.
For once "Tenting To-Night" wan not
Bung, but everybody expected some one to
start at any moment. They sang: "Just
Tell Them That You Saw Me," "She May
Have Seen Better Days," "Ma Angeline,
"Better Than Gold," and kindred songs.
It was the first Sunday night in camp,
and a most pleasant and suitable one.
There is a box of carrier pigeons in
camp. They belong to John Filmer of
422 Jersey street, San Francisco, a brother
of Captain Filmer.
Among the pigeons are Dick and Mary,
two famous birds, which have a record of
flying the twenty-eipht miles from Red
wood City to their loft in San Francisco in
twenty-live minutes. Dick and Mary will
carry messages to The Call before the en
campment is over. At least two birds will
be released each day, with messages to
friends and to Mr. Filmer in the City.
T'.e idea of their use by Captain Filmer is
to establish the practicability of utilizing
homing pigeons as a means of communi
cation between afmy posts in time of war,
when telegraph wires may be down and
other communication cut off.
The relatives and friends of members of
the company who are stopping at the ho
tels are: Mrs. Captain Filmer and family,
Miss Belle Sturtevant, Mrs. W. N. Kelly,
Mrs. T. J. Kelly, Miss Sadie McDermott,
Miss Pailie Langden, Mrs. E. B. Peppm,
Mrs. Dr. Sieberst, Mrs. Emily Sieberst,
Mrs. Henry Osthoff and family, Miss
Mills, W. F. Burke, Arthur Cills and
Max Olaussenius.

pany B in camp at this time is as follows:

LOS ANGELES CRUSADE.
Christian Temperance Women
Declare War on the
Bloomer.
They Insist That the Garment Is
Immodest, Unwomanly and
Demoralizing.
Lob Angeles Office of The Call, )
328 South Broadway. V
Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 16. )
The Los Angeles County Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union has declared war
on the bloomer. At its regular meeting
in Temperance Hair yesterd ay the follow
ing resolution was unanimously adopted:
While we believe in the emancipation of
women from any and all customs which de
prive her of her freedom, either physically or
mentally, yet we are not unmindful that to be
most perfect Is to be most womanly. We most
heartily indorse the bicycle when moderately
and modestly used and believe it Is a blessing
to women in general and working women in
particular, but we regret exceedingly that
many young women abuse the liberty which
this modern invention affords and thereby call
-forth criticisms broad enough and indiscimi
nate enough to wound the heart of every true
woman.
We regard some of the bicycle costumes to
be seen on our streets as unwomanly, inde
cent and demoralizing in their effect There
fore, as a part of the great organization of
Christian womanhood and motherhood, we,
the Central Woman's Christian Temperance
Union of Los Angeles, raise our voice and
enter our protest against this, or any custom,
the tendency of whi h is to debase rather
than elevate the human race.

NEWS Of MARE ISLAND,
The Pensacola Soon to Be Sent
to Goat Island as a
Training Ship.
Will Be Fitted Out With an Eye
Singly to the Comfort of the
Young Seamen.
VALLEJO, Cal., Aug. 16.â The Thetis
will come out of the dry dock at Mare
Island on Monday and the following day
the Pensacola will be taken into dock to be
examined. In case any of the copper on
the hull requires replacing it will be done.
The Pensacola is to be used as a training
ship for boy?. It will require little out
side of painting to fit the ship. Large and
comfortable, it is just the kind of a craft
to house the young men who are to bs-
come seamen in the American Navy.
Those being selected on board the receiv
ing ship Independence are among the
best class of boys.
Many present themselves, but few are
selected. As soon as the Pensacola is
placed in proper shape for reception of the
boys it will be officered and taken to Goat
Island and anchored.
Word has been received for the con
struction department to go ahead and
build the caisson lor the stone dock, but
as much of the iron is io come from the
East it will be a couple of months before
work is commenced, and then it will take
two months to complete the job.
Repairs are going ahead on all the ships,
but without any particular hurry. Very
few more men will De taken on prior to
September 3. Clerks, watchmen and all
employes considering themselves under

at Los Gatos.
the civil service rules are laughing np their
sleeves at how nicely, during the eleventh
hour of the reign of Secretary Herbert,
they have been placed in life positions to
the exclusion of all persons that may be
long to the party of patriotism, protection
and prosperity.
In accordance with the recommenda
tion of Naval Constructor Hich born propo
sals will be received for 242,000 feet of Ore
gon pine in assorted sizes' for ships' deck
plank, to be kept in store at the navy-yard
for use as required. Bids are to be opened
in Washington on the 25th of the month.
It has been the wish of the chief of the
Bureau of Construction for some time past
to have a quantity of timber for deck
planking on hand so that when ships come
to the yard and require repairs to their
decks they can be made without having
to wait for the requisition to be filled.
SAN BERNARDINO STORM.
Terrific Downpour of Rain, Accompanied by
a Heavy Wind Which Does Con
siderable Damage.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Axxg. 16.â
An unusual but not unprecedented atmos
pneric condition obtained in this region
to-day. Tbe morning opened hot and
sultry, with light clouds hanging over the
mountain range. By noon the clouds
were of almost inky blackness and the
distant roar of thunder indicated that at
Squirrel Inn. the Little Bear Valley and
the Big Bear Valley the rain was falling
in torrents. An hour later the storm
clouds moved westward, and Mentoneand
Redlands, at the head of the great valley,
were receiving a terrific downpour of
water.
The storm-ditches were overflowed, and
considerable damage was done to stores
and other property in Redlands. It is re
ported that many orchards were injured
by the rush of waters. In the highlands
trees were blown down and considerable
damage done to the growing orange crops.
In this city the rain fell for two hours
and wrought a radical change in the tem
perature. There was very little wind
here and no damage was done.
Not since August, 1891, has there been a
storm in midsummer that in extent and
severity approached to-day's visitation.
Undoubtedly the streams leading into the
Bear Valley reservoir, and all the streams
from which this valley draws water for
irrigation, have been vastly replenished.
FAESNO WIDOW'S PLAINT
Mrs. Ellen Hilyard Sues Rancher
Bahwell for Breach of
Promise.
She Is Fair and Forty, and the De
fendant Is Hoary With His
Six y Yjars.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 16.â Mrs. Ellen H
Hilyard, by her attorney, George L. Hood,
yesterday filed a suit for $25,000 against
Adam Bahwell of Tulare County for
breach of promise. The plaintiff is about
40 years old and a widow, while the de
fendant is about 60 and a widower. Bah
well resides at Three Rivers, near Visaiia,
and is considered to be worth about $100,
--000. The complaint recites the usual dam
ages which are experienced by plaintiffs
in breach of promise suits by, the non
fulfillment on the part of the defendants of
their promises.
Mrs. Hilyard claims that she has in her
possession a large number of letters writ
ten to her by Mr. Bahwell, in which he ex
pressed his deep love for Her and stated
repeatedly that he would marry her. But
he afterward changed his mind, and Mrs.
Hilyard wauts damages.
LAIRS OF THE TRAMP RAIDED.
Sixty-six Walking lourints Crowded
Into I''renno's Jail.
FRESNO, Cal.. Aug. 16.â The police
and constables made a raid on tramps be
tween 3 o'clock and daylight this morning
and gathered in sixty-six of the tribe.
They locked the prisoners in jail, and that
institution was very much crowded.
Twenty-eight of the tramps had to be put
into the women's ward, there being no
female prisoners in the jail at the time.
The officers raided all the "hobo roosts"
in the city â box-cars, barns and haystacks.
Along with the laboring people who come
to Fresno annually during the fruit season
there is always an influx of worthless char
acters. These have become very bold of
late, and it was therefore determined to
gather them in.
ROMAN BATHS FOR SAN DIEGO.
Arrangement* Under Way for the Con
struction of Extensive Tanks.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Aug. 16.â An insti
tution that will be a welcomed addition to
the city is the Roman baths which E. S.
Babcock proposes to establish as soon as
arrangements can be perfected.
They will be somewhat after the style of
the Sutro public baths at the entrance to
San Francisco Bay, and besides the facili
ties for bathing, will have other con
veniences, which will make them a credit
to San Diego.
The features that have made the Coro
nado baths Â»o popular will be embodied
in the new baths, but the institution to be
erected on this side of the bay will be on
a grand scale.
Tbe building, according to the present
idea, will be two stories high, with a tower
running up from the most prominent cor
ner. The architecture will be modern.
Balconies will run around the interior,
as well as portions of the exterior at the
second story, and there will be spaces to
be filled by potted plants. Light is to be
admitted through a dome, which will con
stitute the roof.
LIVELY FIGHT
IN THE SIXTH,
Patton and Rose Forces in
Battle Array at Los
Angeles.
EACH CLAIMS VICTORY.
To-Day Decides the Race for the
Democratic Congressional
Nomination.
POPULISTS SEIZING FUSION.
Their Efforts to Hive Barlow Indorsed
Not Likely to Be Suc

Los Angeles Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway, V
Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 16^ )
Most of the delegates to the adjourned
meeting of the Sixth District convention
of the Democratic party, which will con
vene here to-morrow, are in the city. All
manner of rumors have been flying about
the streets during the day. The Rose
contingent claims that Rose is a sure
winner on the first ballot. Patton, how
ever, has his forces well in hand and is
sure of one additional vote owing to the
action of Delegate Irvine, who has re
voked his proxy given to Chairman Aler
ritt at the Ventura meeting.
The Populist delegates from San Luis
Obispo are expected here to-morrow in
time to attend tbe Democratic conven
tion, and it is understood they will make
a strong plea in favor of the Indorsement
of their nominee, A. C. Barlow of San
Luis Obispo.
This move of the Populists will meet
with small encouragement from Demo-
crats and will not be urged by the rank
and file of the Populist party here, which,
as friends of Dillon, are not at all pleased
with the manner in which that gentle
man was turned down at San Luis Obispo.
Patton'B friends claim that in the event of
his nomination he will get the bulk of the
Populist vote of Los Angeles County, de
spite the nomination of Barlow.
The triangular fight which is certain to
result will unquestionably result in the
re-election of Congressman McLachian,
the Republican nominee.

NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 16.â Captain
Dodge of the infantry company sent
to the north, returned at 6 o'clock to
night, with a squad of soldies, having
in charge three Yaqui Indians captured
this afternoon a few miles east of Tubac,
twenty-two miles north of Nogales. The
Indians were traveling toward Tucson
and were heavily armed. They say they
came from Washington Camp, a raining
town on the American side, twenty miles
northeast of Nogales and were on their
way to Oro Blanco in search of work.
They deny that they had anything to do
with the fight at Nogales. They will be
held by Colonel Bacon to await the action
of the War Department.
A report has just been received that Cap
tain Bomis is on the way from Oro Blanco
with thirty more Yaquis found in that vi
cinity this morning. All were armed.
Mexican cavalrymen, who arrived late
lÂ«st night from Buenos Ayres, a United
States custom-house fifty "miles west of
here, report that a ereat many Indians are
going toward Sasabe, a Mexican town
seven miles west of Buenos Ayres.
Only a portion of .those he saw had arms
and he did not know what they were go
ing to Sasabe for.
A Mexican custom guard while drunk
to-night shot and wounded a bartender in
Cazabon's saloon at Nogales, Sonora. Two
shots were fired, but only one took effect,
making a flesh wound in the hip. The
shots caused great excitement for a few
moments, as the people thought the
Yaquis had returned to take the town.

KENNAH'S DEATH
NEAR SIX-MILE,
Futile Efforts of the Old
Man's Friends to Save
His Life.
WEDGED IN A CREVASSE
Succumbed to the Cold While
His Companions Toiled to
Reach Him.
SAID HE SUFFERED TORTURES.
His Last Word an Affirmative Reply
When Asked if His Pain
Was Great.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 16.-Full de
tails of the horrible death of Merchant
Edward Kennah of Mt. Vernon, Wash.,
while on a pleasure and prospecting trip
in the Cooks Inlet country, have been re
ceived. They confirm the brief account
given in these dispatches of Kennah
slowly freezing to death while wedged in
a glacier crevasse, his friends being un
able to extricate him.
A party of six men, Kennah among
them, left Six-mile Creek on July 2 to
ascend T wen i.y-mile River. After rowing
twenty miles up Turnagain arm to the
mouth of the river they packed their
blankets and provisions on their backs
and traveled on foot. When about fifteen
miles up the river they found their way
carred by a steep and narrow gorge.
Leaving the canyon, they climbe ! the
mountain on one side, crossed a low divide
and struck a tributary canyon which
emptied into the river above the gorge.
The upper end, however, was filled by a
large glacier.
They started to cross the glacier with
the guide about 400 yards in the lead.
The second man in line suddenly broke
through the snow crust and fall into a
crevasse. His rifle, which he was carry
ing in one hand, cauglft on either edge of
the crevasse and he easily pulled himself
out. The next man took Kennah's shovel
and laying it on the snow stepped across.
He handed the shovel to its owner and
went on his way.
He bad gone about thirty feet when
there was a cry from the rear, "Man
down."" Kennah was nowhere in sight.
Four men hurried to the crevasse and
looked down. The old man could not be
seen, but answered their calls. Ha said
he was not hurt, but that he was slipping
down further. The men hastily tied three
pairs of blankets together for a rope.
The guide who came back added a piece
of clothes line, making a rope about sixty
feet long. They let this down with a pick
on tbe end of it and told the old man to
place it between his feet. He said that he
| could not move his arms. Evidently one
I leg was loose, for the men abovecould
hear him moving the pick around.
"Boys, it is no use. I am a goner. I
can do nothing to save myself. I will
have to die."
The others cheered him to keep up bis
courage. His. partner, a small man, tied
the improvised rope around his waist and
went down. He found that the crevasse
went straight down for twenty feet, when
it branched off at an angle to a width of
eighteen inches. He could get down only
thirty feet and Kennah waa yet twenty
feet further down and out of sight.
The unfortunate man beeged him not
to risk his life any further, and said: "I
can't talk any more, boys." In answer to
their question as to whether he was suf
fering much pain, he said, faintly, "Yes."
That was the last word he uttered, and
his companions concluded that he had
frozen to death, and it was impossible to
do anything more for him. Reluctantly
they wended their way down the glacier.

BEAUTIFUL SANTA

Are 2,641,737 Fruit Trees
in Bearing.
SAN JOSE A HEALTH EESOET.

of New Yorkâ A City of
Fine Buildings.
SAN JOSE, C>,l., Aug. 15.â "One of the
three most beautiful valleys in the
world."
The above sentiment was the praise
accorded Santa Clara Valley by Bayard
Taylor, and no one who has had the good
fortune to become at all familiar with this
section, so frequently referred to as the
"garden spot of the world," can fail to
find an echo in their hearts of the words
above quoted. Nature has indeed been
lavish of her bounties here and seems to
wear a perpetual smile as thougn pleased
with her every touch. The satisfaction
expressed in word and manner by the
residents of Santa Clara Valley with their
environments is readily excused, as in
point of location, climatic and other ad
vantages necessary for the prosperity of a
people this valley is unsurpassed.
Santa Clara County, while being an in
land county, is situated at such a conve
nient distance from San Francisco Bay as
to receive the benefit of the invigorating
sea breezes, which the beautiful Santa Cruz
mountains that border this valley so pleas
antly temper, and no day in summer fails
to bring these invigorating and life-giving
breezes. The population of Santa Clara
County borders closely on 60,000, a popu
lation gained in 4he last generation, and
more emphatic than words can tell, their
prosperity is shown by an increase in the
total county valuation from $40,000,000 in
1886 to $56,000,000 in the present year.
As to the source of this wealth,
one has but to drive over its
miles of splendid roads upon which $100,
--000 is annually expended for sprinkling
alone, and note the thousands of acres of
orchards, representing every known fruit
grown, the various fruit-dryers and .can
neries, worked to their fullest capacity;
the vineyards and well-equipped wineries
scattered throughout the country, the
dairies, which for size and completeness
are not often equaled, and many other in
dustries which these conditions call forth,
and wonder succeeds wonder at the ap
parently never-ending vista, yet one is
compelled frequently to exclaim:
"What golden wealth," and needs no
further explanation of tne Assessor's
figures. A mistaken idea, however, and
one unfortunately too prevalent in the
minds of Eastern people, according to the
statement of an officer of the Board of
Trade here, is that the grand achieve
ments in the fruit industry in this county
ere due almost entirely to the soil and
climate and very little to the labor and
intelligence of the orchardist. To the in
tending settler it will be well that this
view will find no lodgment in his mind,
for whil" the soil and climate, as has been
said, are as favorable to .he cultivation of
fruit as that of any other locality in the
State, yet the best results have been
reached only where the highest intelli
gence, the most painstaking labor and the
most persistent efforts have been dis
played.
This is a point upon which too much
emphasis cannot be placed, for while na
ture is ever kind yet her reward is only to
the industrious. It might be well at this
juncture to call attention to a frequent
cause of worry and embarrassment to the
fruit-grower, one responsible perhaps
more than any other cause for the failure
of the orchardist's hopes, and that is the
ambition of many to own large orchards
on a small investment in the belief that
they can pull througti the youthful period
of the orchard and in tbe end be comfort
ably established through the disposal of
an extensive fruit crop. Why msn fall
into this error it is difficult to explain, as
many of these are men who have been en
gaged in mercantile pursuits, but who
would never have expected to do a busi
ness of $100,000 per year on a capital of
$10,000, and yet this is just what many are
attempting, with the result that they are
hampered in all their efforts through a se
ries of years, and eventually disappointed.
There is indisputable evidence of the
profit in fruit culture anywhere in the vast
fertile valley, and thi3 is to be found in
the prosperity of those engaged in it and
tbe largely increased acreage in orchards
each year. The following figures will be
of interest in this particular: ~

The total number ot bearing fruit trees
in the county is placed at 2,641,737; non
bearing trees, 1,933,804; grand total of fruit
trees in county, 4,575,541. Tbe increase in
bearing French prune trees in 1896 over
1895 is 70,913. The increase in peach trees
this year over 1895 is 23,930.
While the above list tells its own story
as to the adaptability of Santa Clara
County for the growth of fruit of every
kind, yet this is pre-eminently the center
for prunes of the very highest quality,
the peculiar climatic conditions demanded
by this choice fruit being found here to a
degree not obtained elsewhere in the
world. This statement contains no exag
geration, as can be easily and satisfactorily
proven.
No other fruit is so highly and uni
versally recommended by physicians as a
health diet as is the prune, and it is little
wonder that its culture is receiving tbe
attention given to it by orcbardists of this
valley. In order. to give our readers a
clearer idea of what is represented in the
yield of the immense acreage of Santa
Clara County, or a portion of it at least,
we append the following table:
Arjd while decreases from the figures of the
output for the previous year are the rule, the
remarkable increase of over 14,000,000 pounds
in shipments of dried prunes lor the season of
1895, as compared with 1894, goes a long way
toward making; up the decrease in shipment of
all kinds of fruit, wine and garden seed.
The figures of prune shipments are greater
than for any previous year. During the twelve
months from July 1, 1893, to June 30, 1894,
the shipments amounted t0 38,704,350 pounds,
and were the heaviest on record for any season

at that time. During the past season ending

In the foregoing we have endeavored to
demonstrate the claims of Santa Clara
County as a spot favorable for homes and
investment, but in addition it affirms its
right to a place at the very head of all the
health resorts of the State on account of
its equable climate and its many and
varied mineral springs, the analysis of
which is equal to those of the world-famed
springs of Europe. Here are to be found
Vichy Hot Springs, sulphur, soda and
many others, and innumerable cures tes
tify to their excellent worth.
The position of Santa Clara County as
an educational center is so well known as
to hardly need mention, as here are
located the Leland Stanford University,
University of the Pacific, Santa Clara Col
lege, State Normal School, besides con
servatories of music and various acade
mies.
The world-famed Lick Observatory, con
taining the monster 36-inch glass, the lat
ter costing $60,000, an observatory which
has done as much probably for astronomi
cal science through its corps of learned
professors as almost any other in the world,
is situated here and is reached through a
mountain drive both beautiful and com
fortable.
No article on Santa Clara County is
complete without special reference to San
Jose, the county seat, and which once vis
ited can never be forgotten on account of
its beautiful broad thoroughfares and
well-paved streets, so prettily adorned
with graceful palms and shade trees.
In its very business center is St. James
Park with" its fountain, large shade trees
and well kept lawns, and opposite is the
Hall of Records, a building which would
do honor to any city, and adjoining is the
Courthouse, an imposing structure which
cost $400,000. Recently erected is a post
office building costing nearly $200,000 and
which is indeed "a thing of beauty," and
facing this is the City Hall and Free Li
brary. Its business blocks and banking
institutions give the city a decidedly pros
perous and substantial air, which condi
tion is certainly borne out by the commer
cial history of the city, as through all the
trying years just passed not one of the
banks closed its doors or suffered embar
rassment.
As a health resort San Jose points to the
following table as proof of its position :
DEATH BATE.
New York, 24.19 per 1000 per annum.
Philadelphia, 17.17 per 1000 per annum.
Baltimore, 20.31 per 1000 per annum.
Richmond, Va., 20.10 per 1000 per annum.
Savannah, 33.75 per 1000 per annum.

San Diego, 10.98 per 1000 per annum.
Lot Angeles, 15.82 per 1000 per annum.
San Jose, 11.78 per 1000 per annum.
San Jose is but fifty miles from San
Francisco, and has an excellent and fre
quent train service to that city, fifteen
trains each way being the daily service, in j

addition to which communication is had
Dy steamer from Alviso.
In concluding this article too much
praise cannot be accorded the directors of
the Board of Trade for their intelligent
and untiring efforts to aQvance the inter
ests or the county. The board consists of
Colonel T. R. Weaver, president, who,
although a newcomer to the county, has
done much to unite the fruit-growers of
the valley into a working organization,
and C. J. Steeple, treasurer, and A. C.
Darby, C. M. Hatcher. J. D. Miner, Wil
liam Osterman, S.E. Smith, A. O. Bacon,
L. M. Hale and J. P. Fay, secretary.
The Board of Trade maintains an excel
lent permanent exhibit, conveniently situ
ated, and is the only bureau of informa
tion in the county. It distributes large
quantities of statistical matter throughout
the East and answers multitudinous in
quiries from intending settlers. Take it
all together, California may indeed feel a
pride in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley.
CITIZEN SOLDIERS
OF THE STATE.
Major-General N. T. James, division
commander of the National Guard, has
resolved to ascertain definitely whether
the ammunition supplied to the troops is
of the highest grade. He has determined
to promote efficiency in rifle practice in
the guard, and, as a preliminary step, will
see that ammunition is supplied that can
be relied upon.
Following is a copy of an order issued
from division headquarters last Saturday:
Regimental inspectors of rifle practice
and those officers under whose personal
direction and inspection the annual pre
liminary rifle practice of this year has
been held (including Naval Battalion,
cavalry troops and Signal Corps) will, as
soon after the receipt of this order as is
practicable, make out (in duplicate) and
submit to these headquarters the report of
sucb practice under the following head
ings: (A) The kind of ammunition used,
its quality and cost. (B) A summary of
the number of men in each organization
who are entitled to shoot, and the number
actually present. (C) A summary of the
number of men who qualifiea for 60, 80
and 90 per cent.
These reports will be accompanied by
such suggestions as would, in the opinion
of the officers making the reports, benefit
and encourage rifle practice in the Na
tional Guard. Brigade inspectors will
closely examine these reports and indorse
thereon such remarks and suggestions as
would, in their opinion, benefit the prac
tice, and forward the reports to headquar
ters, with as little aelay as possible. It is
desired by the division commander that
the above reports shall be full and ex
haustive and shall contain sucb recom
mendations as may be considered neces
sary to ehequrago the rifle practice of the
Guard, which is of the most vital im
portance.
At Sacramento weekly drills in the Sec
ond Infantry are no longer tasks to be
shirked, and under the existing regula
tions they command eood attendance.
The friendly rivalry existing between the
two companies tend to excite the ambi
tion of both officers and privates. Out. of
a membership of eighty Company G
turned out sixly-five "strong at drill on
last Monday night, many being away on
summer vacations. Captain Steams of
this company having reported Privates
Pierce and Luttrell as having violated the
military rules by non-attendance at
weekly drills, a court-martial has been
called by order of Colonel Gutdrie, com
manding the Second Brigade, to be held
on the 17th inst. Captain Shoemaker of
Company E has been detailed to preside.
B Cavalry Troop is considering a camp
ing trip to be made in regular campaign
ing order, and will settle the question at
its meeting to be held, next Wednesday
evening. It is the intention to make a
raid in the direction of Stockton, leaving
Sacraiaenjo mounted and conveying full
supplies. The members of the troop are
displaying great interest and pride in
their drills and equipments, and bid fair
to become the banner troop of the State.
But for downright hard work, prompt
ness at drill and individual interest the
members of the Third Brigade Signal
Corps, under the command of Lieutenant
Fred Martin, are entitled to the palm.
The men have a laudable ambition to
outrank all the other corps in everything,
and are in a fair way to accomplish their
object. It is a rare thing for any member
to miss drill, and it is their intention
to institute a series of monthly field
drills, to be held on the last Sunday of
each month. The members will leave
Sacramento mounted, in light marching
order, and will spend the day in drill and
cutlass practice. They have introduced a
number of telegraph instruments into their
headquarters and are practicing assidu
ously to perfect themselves in the use of
them. This is without doubt one of the
best drilled heliograph corps in the State,
and Lieutenant Martin reports that he
never has to infuse any enthusiasm among
the members, but on the contrary has to
restrain them in their work.
Company B, Filth Infantry, of San Jose
is in a better condition to-day than ever
before. Since the removal of the company
into its new armory on Market street, be
tween Santa Clara and St. John,~much
enthusiasm has been displayed by the men
in the affairs of the company, and attend
ance at meetings has been more regular
and much larger. The membership is over
sixty, and the average attendance at drills
and meetings is forty. During the past
few months the company has increared
rapidly, from one to three recruits being
received each Monday evening.
Next Saturday evening, August 29, Com
pany B will march to Alum Rocic Park,
seven miles east of towu, returning Sun
day evening. The start will be made from
the armory at 10 p. M. The men will carry
their haversacks, canteens, cups, etc., and
mess in true army style. Cooks will be
detailed from the ranks. The company
has made this trip several times, and the
boys enjoy it immensely.
Much interest is being manifested in the
monthly tareet shoots, and the men are
greatly improving in shooting under Ser
geant L. B. Wood, the inspector of rifle
practice.
Last Sunday there was a prize shoot, in
winch forty prizes were donated by mer
chants. Sergeant C. E. Hubdack secured
first prize with a ?core of 43. Private
White won second prize with a score of 42.
Sergeant Wood was third with 41. Ser
geant Hubback is the crack shot of the
oompany.
Company B will elect officers next
month. In all probability Captain Part
ridge will be, re elected, as he is well liked,
and under his captaincy the company has
made much progress. It was due to his
efforts that the company secured its new
armory. There is no opposition to the re
election of First Lieutenant J. J. Adel, and
Second Lieutenant W. Searle is scheduled
for his old place.
Company B. First Infantry, of San
Francisco went into camp yesterday at
Los Gatos for a week. The tents are
pitched in Shore's Grove.
Company E. Third Infantry, of Santa
Rosa, is in a flourishing condition. The
company numbers sixty-six men not in
cluding commissioned officers, all of whom
take a deep interest in their duties. They
have a comfortable armory on Hinton
avenue containing drillroom, dressing
rooms, reading-rooms, officers' quarters,
etc., in which the members are wont to
gather several times a week for recreation
and pleasure. The attendance at regular
meetings and lor Monday night drill is
unusually good, Company E having
always ranked high in percentage of at
tendance.
The competitive shoot of the battalion
is still undecided, Company C of Petaluma
having won the fiist shoot held at Peta
luma, Santa Rosa winning the second
event on the home range by one point.
The deciding trial will take place at Peta
luma September 1.
Captain Horen has recommended the
promotion of five non-commissioned offi
cers as follows: Corporal Roger P. Smith
as sergeant, and Privates George W. Koh-
Jer, Jessie A. Craft, Paul Coulter and
Frederic Schaupp as corporals. It is prob
able that- Company C of Petaluma will
join Company E in a summer camp.
A committee of which First Lieutenant
Bean is chairman has been appointed to
confer with a like committee from Com
pany C, and a report will probably be
made at the next meeting. There is an
unusual amount of dramatic and musical
ability among the members of Company C,
and many fine home entertainments are
given.
Napa's Company H, Fifth Infantry, Is
in a nourishing condition. There are now
fifty-eight names on the company roll and
several applications for membership,
which have not yet been acted upon.
The company was formerly Battery B,
Second Artillery, commanded by Colonel
William Macdonald, and during the strike
in 1894 did service in the "West Oakland
railroad yards with the other batteries of
the regiment. In commemoration of the
anniversary of the return from the yards,
the members, ex-members of the company
and invited guests assembled at the
armory on the evening of J uly 27 last and
sat down to a banquet prepared for the oc
casion. Captain F. G. Easterby gave
remin iscences of camp life, especially in
the yards.
The company is now attached to the
Fifth Infantry. Although the company
bas been attached to the Fifth only since
December last, the feeling existing between
the members of the regiment is most
friendly.
The company tias the regular monthly
class shoots in accordance with regimental
rules, and also a monthly contest for the
Hadtield modal, which has to be won
three times consecutively before per
manently kept by the winner. Private
Bates, who has twice won the medal, is its
present holder.
July 1 the election for company offi
cers was held. Captain F. G. Easterby and
First Lieutenant H. H. Muller declined re
election, and so the following were elected
to fill the vacancies: Sergeant F. W.
Bush, captain ; First Sergeant H. L. Gunn,
first lieutenant, and Sergeant Hoff second
lieutenant. The members of the company
deeply regret that Captain Easterby and
Lieutenant Muller will he with the com
pany in an official capacity but a short
time longer, for these officers by their
persevering efforts had gained the love
and respect of all the men.
The company, which for three years of
its existence bas used one of the larger
apartments in the Williams block on
Main street as its armory, moved recently
to Hoff' s ball, at the lower end of Main
street, where it now has ample room for
expansion and growth.
A broad stairway leadi up to a spacious
landing on the second floor, from which
first opens off the officers' private apart
ments. These are well lighted, and the ven
tilated rooms contain private lockers of
the officers and are well furnished with
tables and comfortable chairs.
The main assembly-room, which is used
for lounging and reading purposes, is 35x
75 feet in size. This room is furnished
with pooltables, a library, tables on which
are the leading periodicals of the times,
and pictures appropriate to an armory,
forming a most pleasing and interesting
feature of the company's new apartments.
Tbe large drill hall, which is 100 feet
long and 60 feet in width, is the feature of
the new armory.
On the evening of September 9 a grand
opening ball will be given by the com
pany. The committee of arrangements is
making every effort to have it successful
in all particulars. It is expected lhat
some of the brigade and regimental
officers will be present.
Company D, Fifth Infantry, of San
Rafael went into camp at Mill Valley last
Saturday night.
The company expects to h,ave an elec
tion for lieutenant in a month. Second
Lieutenant F. J. Murray is spoken of as a
likely man for first lieutenant, and Ser
geant A. N. Boyen for second lieutenant, if
he will accept. There is anticipation of
target range practice next year. A suit
able site for the range is a tract below the
San Pedro landing, which the company
would be glad to purchase at a nominal
figure, if they were able to raise the
money by subscriptions from private
citizens. Another suitable site is on the
marsh, south of the town, between the
canal and the old toll road. This, how
ever, would involve greater expense before
it could be used. The chamoion medal
for target practice this month was won by
J. F. Robinson, private.
At Merced Company H, Sixth Infantry,
is located. The attendance at drills, which
is always somewhat light during the sum
mer months, when many of the men are in
the harvest fields, is picking up again.
After the regular drill asocial time will be
indulged in by the members of the com
pany. Music and refreshments are on the
programme.
The last regimental orders announced
the promotion of the following privates:
Leo Muller, D. C. Jones, D. F. Griffin, E.
Jackman and George C. Adrain to be cor
porals, and Art S. Guthrie, recently trans
ferred to this company from quartermas
ter sergeant Company X, Seventh In
fantry, to be sergeant. The same orders
also discharge Serjeant C. T. Wright,
Corporal Roy vonden Heuveland Privates
Frank King, William Griffin and C. D.
Radcliffe, for expiration of term. New
members this month are Emery J. Buck
ley and Manuel Martinez.
Captain Kittle, A. D. C. Third Brigade,
passed through Merced last week on his
way to Minturn on 4 visit to old friends.
Company H will parade in Stockton
with the entire regiment on the occasion
of thej Native Sons' Admission day cele
bration.
Salinas is fortunate in having one of ihe
mounted companies of the National Guard.
Troop C, commanded by Captain Burke,
will soon be one of the best drilled com
panies in the State. Seriieant Donohoe of
D Battery, Fifth Artillery, U. S. A., is in
Salinas on a three months' furlough, ami
is giving nightly instruction to Troop C.
He is an excellent tactician and drillmas
ter, and his efficient work for the next
thref months will place the soldiers above
the average of the National Guard com
panies of the State.
The new armory building will be com
pleted the last of this month, and will be
formally opened by Troop C September 9.
The building is a 2-story structure, 45x130
feet, built of Arizona sandstone and brick,
and was designed especially for Troop O.
The members of the troop are determined
to give a good report of themselves, as the
number in attendance at regular drills, av
eraging sixty-five, will show.

FIVE MILES IN 11:24.
The Fastest Event of the Year
Over the San Leandro-Hay
wards Course.
H. G. EDWARDS THE WINNER.
S. A. Neuman Won the Barker
Cycling Club's Event and L Prank
Made Best Time.
George W. Tantau of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen rode the fastest five miles ever
covered in a road-race, in a race promoted
by that club over the Sau Leandro-Hay
wards course yesterday noon, starting
from scratch and finishing in fifth place
against a score of contestants, his net rid
ing time bting 11 minutes and 24 seconds.
J. E. Wing started from the same mark
with Tantau and finished half a wheel's
length back of him, his time being but a
fifth of a second slower.
For some time past the members of the
Olympic Club Wheelmen have been care
fully training for the race of yesterday,
and their efforts were probably the more
conscieutious because of considerable
friendly rivalry existing among the mem
bers. When the entry list closed there
were twenty-six names down, of whom
about twenty started.
The course over wnich the race was rid
den seems to get harder and smoother
every Sunday, and yesterday, with the ex
ception of a short stretch near the start,
it was nearly perfect. This, coupled with
the fact that the riders were aided by a
strong wind at their back-, helpa to ac
count for the phenomenally last time
made by all the men, the slowest of them
all riding the five miles under a three
minute gait.
Tan tau has lon g been known as one of
the fastest amateurs of the Olympic Club,
and hence his ride of yesterday was not
such a great surprise to his fellow mem
bers, but up to tbis time tne fastest time
made by any of the cracks over the course
tliis year has been over 12 minutes, and
Tantau has dropped over a half minute
under that.
George Fuller started with the scratch
men and was on equal terms with them
when he fell, about a mile from the finish.
He was not badly hurt, but lost all
chances in the race, though be pluckiiy
remounted and rode it out. Hansen, Cun
ningham and one or two others met with
accidents to their wheels and were obliged
10 drop out.
The winner of the race was H. G. Ed
wur'ls, who bad a handicap of two minutes.
It was his first race, and tliis also applies
to E. A. Heimore and H. H. Cosgrifr, who
started trom tbe same mark and finished
close oeiiind Edwards. The riding of
these three men was particularly credit
able for their first performance.

of yesterday, will con time in iraiDing

HE CLAIMS HE
WAS PERSECUTED
Butler Miller's Grievances
Against the Detec
tives.
DRIVEN FROM THE CITY
The Hero of the Franklin Resi
dence Tragedy Again
Arrested.
IN SANTA BARBARA'S PRISON.
Captain Lees Declares H m a Bad Man,
Even Worse Than Is Oliver
Winfield Winthrop.
The .'arrest of Frank J. Miller in Santa
Barbara, as , announced â in the dispatches
yesterday morning, reopens one of the
most sensational episodes in the criminal
annals of this City. -
Miller, who was at the time a butler in
the employ of J. L. Franklin, a * lottery
dealer, had for the second time made a
hero of himself in repulsing the attacks of
burglars upon bis master's silver chest.
This time, however, instead of simply
frightening the thieves away, he killed
one of them, and, being himself wounded,
he swooned and the dead robber's body
was found lying across his own. "
It was a most tragic affair, and the
young man's . bravery was extolled no
where so loudly as in the Franklin home.
The detectives worked :on the case for
weeks trying to ' solve certain details that
did not appear very clear. , They were con
siderably hampered in their, investigation
by the Franklins themselves, who "Would
not listen to any suggestion that there
were many suspicious circumstances con*
nected with , the f case. Finally, one fine
day, Mr. Franklin bundled his butler out
of the house and his whereabouts became
a perfect mystery so far as the public was
concerned. -
The lottery man acknowledged that
Captain Lees had convinced mm that
Miller was a dangerous man, and that in
stead of having shot and killed a burglar
while protecting his master's house he had
simply coax, d an inoffensive tramp to
visit him at the California-street mansion,
where he murdered him in cold blood.
At no time during the duration of , the
sensation, even when the case was brought
before the Grand Jury, was Miller per
mitted to make a public statement to the
press. At all times he wad guarded, and
being satisfied to get away unmolested
Miller kept his own story locked securely
within his breast until this time, when
new troubles have come upon him, and he
has given the details of the affair, as he
regards them, to a representative of The
Call. He said :
On February 15 my deposition was taken by
Captain Lees, a reporter and Detectives Gib
son and Wren. I told them the story just as it
happened as nearly as I could remember. The
Coroner's inquest was adjourned from time to
time until I was able to â about Febru
ary 22 â when I told the jury all about the af
fair as I recollected it. The corpse of the burg
lar lay in the Morgue eight days awaiting
identification. â 
â  All kinds of rumors were abroad, some im
plicating me in the attempted burglary and
others alleging that I decoyed a tramp to the
house with the intention of killing him. with
the expectation of gaining -a bie reward and
adding to my reputation lor bravery. An irre
sponsible tramp testified at the inquest that
while out on the evening of February 11 I
gave him directions in writing how to reach
the Franklin residence, and promising to give
him some clothes , and $5 'if he would . come
there the following: evening and carry away
two bundles that I would give him. â  :
He swore that he did not go, as . some fellow
tramps whom he told about the proposition
advised him not to do po, as there was ' evi
dently some trick in the ; offer. v The . theory
sought to be established by this vagabond's
testimony was that failing â to induce , this
tramp to come I led another one into the trap
and killed him. - But the verdict of the Coro
ner's jury was that it was , justifiable homicide
and I was exonerated.' â' "
About this time there were published state
ments that I , was to â â¢' be ' rearrested ' for j the
crime. Mr. Franklin, who had all along stood
nobly by me, was much . excited over â  these
rumors, but I was calm and cool, as I believed
I had notning to fear, having done nothing to
make me afraid. The threatened arrest was
not made and, I had, recovered- sufficiently to
resume my : regular | work, when Mr. Franklin
informed me one evening that my case was to
come up again," but he would stand by me
through thick and thin. In the meantime the
matter was â  brought before the Grand Jury,
Captain Lees attempting to get me indicted
for murder, but District Attorney Barnes dis
missed the case. '-..; .>'â¢;â > â¢:; ; â  â Â£ .â -..-...â 
Mr. Franklin bad assured me of his belief in
my innocence all along, but at last, yielding to
the pressure brought by Lees, he dismissed me.
He urged me to go to Australia, as he declared
the police would give me no rest here. But as
I had done nothing to be ashamed oi I declined
to go. ,"..â¢â â¢ :â  â '. Â»â¢ - ' â¢'â â¢â _*:^i;.3SÂ£ - ; -;'- â¢. .â¢-.- *
- I think the reason Mr, Franklin got rid of me
was > because - the ; police threatened .to ' make
trouble â  for : him if he didn't- discharge â  me.
Franklin and a man named Metzger conduct
the Little Louisiana and Little Mexican lot
teries in room 48, Wells-Fargo â¢< building. The
police could close them up if they wanted to,

as I understand the business is unlawful. I
think it was fear of police interference with
this business that induced Franklin to let me
go. He had trouble with his mail on account
of the lottery business during the time I
worked for him.
I consider that I have been very grossly
maligned and badly treated, and am to-day
practically banished from San Francisco oh
account of unwarranted persecution by the
police.
Since his disappearance from this City
the whereabouts of Miller have been
known to very few people. Captain LeeÂ«
followed his movements to San Jose,
where the fellow made capital out of his
notoriety, and then be dropped out of
si^ht until arrested the other day in Santa
Barbara for abducting Hattie Auber, a
14-year-old girl, from Los Angeles.
It turns out now that Milier between
the date of his disappearance from San
Jose and his capture in Santa Barbara
was working as a cook in a cheap restau
rant of Los Angeles where he met Misa
Auber.
In speaking of Miller last evening Cap
tain Lees declared :
"I am not astonished in the least that
this fellow has again been arrested. He is
a man with a bad record, and I don't ex
pect anything good to come from him.
He is by far a worse man than is Win
throp.
"As to his accusations that the police
have been persecuting him they are en
tirely false. I never saw or consulted
Franklin about him and in no way did I
Influence Franklin to discharge him.
Franklin upheld the fellow like any man
would who believed him to be innocent
until he learned for himself be was de
fending a bad man. Then discharge fol
lowed/
FRANKLIN IS HIS FRIEND.
Frank J. Miller Still Places Utmost
Confidence In His Old
Employer.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 16.â
Hattie Auber, the little girl brought here
by Frank Miller to lead a life of shame,
left with her mother for Los Angeles on
the morning train. Miller yesterday wrote
a note, which he attempted to smuggle to
the girl, begging her to swear that they
had been married in Los Angeles, and
warning her that if she did not he would
get five years in San Quentin. The au
thorities here feel 9ure that they have
plenty of evidence upon whicn to convict
Miiler, and state that the girl will be re
called when she ie wanted to testify. To
morrow the accused man will plead, and
thereafter he will be locked up in a cell,
having, heretofore been allowed the run of
the jail. Milier behaves well in confine
ment, but there is an uneasy suspicion
that the man may at any time do some
desperate act, as he is plainly impressed
with the enormity of his situation.
To-day he objected strongly to having a
statement already furnished a Call cor
respondent concerning the Franklin case
published, not knowing that the matter
was already in type.
"When I get out of this fix I'm perfectly
willing to tell what I know about it," he
said earnestly.
"But why should I Btir up that matter
now, when it can't do me any good? For
that matter, the jury came to a decision
long ago about the killing In San Fran
cisco, and I can't see that it can do any
good at this late day to stir it up again.
"Mr. Franklin has always been a good
friend to me; he has helped me before,
and he will help me again if I ask him to."

TEN THOUSAND
SHOTS FIRED,
The Great Shooting Festi
val of the Califor
nia Club.
FOR PRIZES AND HONORS
An Exciting Race Between Fak
tor and Schuster for
Most Centers.
MARKSMEN FEOM SAN JOSE.
They Carry Off Their Share ot the
Laurels - Fred Kuhnle Still
in the Ranks.
Between 8:45 a. m. and 6:30 p. m. yester
day about 10,000 rifle bullets were shot
over the Schuetzen Park rifle range. The
occasion of this flight of leaden pellets
was the annual shooting festival of the
California Schuetzen Club, which was a
success in every respect. Twenty targets
were in constant use all day, and the sale
of shooting tickets amounted to nearly
$1500. It must not be inferred that this
was clear profit, for the club put up many
hundred dollars in cash prizes.
The big shoot was not ended yesterday,
but will be resumed on next Sunday.when
on the honorary target about $1000 in
merchandise and special prizes will be
shot for. Besides this there will be sev
eral other interesting events.
As stated, the attendance was very
large, and included many members of the
San Francisco Schuetzen Club, Germania
Club, Red Men's shooting section, the Col
umbia Pistol and Rifle Club ana the San
Jose Turner Schuetzen section.
The representatives from the latter or
ganization were Captain Fred Schumacher,
the president of the club, Dr. Fred Bangs,
Karl Klein and J. G. McMillen, the County
Surveyor of Santa Clara County. The San
Jose Club will bold a shooting festival on
the last day of this month as a sort of a
house-warming of the new San Jose rifle
range, and the representatives yesterday
extended a hearty invitation to all local
marksmen to attend their festival. These
gentlemen did credit to their club by get
ting in several excellent scores, as shown
hereafter.
There was one member of the California
Club whose presence was missed yester
day. For years past Albert Ebrenpfort
has been a* constant attendant on every
shoot and he has won many prizes. He
recently won a prize that puts all others in
the background for the time being. On
Wednesday he took to wife Miss Rebecca
Cornahrens and he is now in the southern
part of the State taking a pleasure tour
with his bride.
San Quentin Point was well represented
by marksmen who made a few good scores.
For example, J. Jones made 64 rings on
the honorary target and 57 on the point
target, F. J. Robinson ran up 69 on the
honorary target and 55 on the point tar
get, C. J. Waldon shot out 65 on the
honorary target and 57 on the point target.
There were a number wuo were deci
dedly unfortunate. For example, Wil
liam Glindemann, one of the best shots on
the coast, broke his trigger before firing a
shot, and be had to hold hard to make
even a fair score with a strange gun.
Philo Jacoby met with a similar acci
dent, and did all of his shooting by press
ing forward tne set trigger to make the
hammer fall, a decidediy unique manner
of target sh( oting. Henry R. Brown was
equally unlucky. Some one knocked his
rifle off the rack and broke the front sight.
Those who considered themselves unfor
tunate by their not having made better
scores need not be mentioned.
There were four. events on the pro
gramme, which were designated as the
i.ian, king, point and honorary target
matches.
There were also special prizes given.
These were won as follows: Best first
bullseye in the morning, D. W. McLaugh
lin, 25 rings, $5; last best bullseye before
noon, F. P. Schuster, 24, $2 50: best first
bullseye in the afternoon, Dr. Fred Bangs,
25, $2 50; best last bullseye in the after
noon, J. B. Turner, 24, $2 50; first center
shot on the man target, Philo Jacoby,
$2 50; first 25 ring shot on the honorary
target, T. G. Carroll, $2 50; highest num
ber of points on the point target, D. B.
Faktor, 848; second highest, P. F. Schus
ter, 827; third highest, Captain Fred
Kuhnle, 550; fourth highest, A. Strecker,
512.
Only two men shot tickets for the honor
of Shooting King, although the main
prize is a $50 diamond medal, and eight
cash prizes will also be presented. Many
scores of ten shots each will no doubt be
made in this event next Sunday. Dr. L. 0.
Rodgers made 205 rings ana Al Gehret 204
rings. Both spoiled their scores by a
"flier" that could not be accounted for.
On the four honorary targets (German
ring) about 300 three-shot tickets were dis
posed of, and every effort was made to
reach the coveted possible oi 75 rings.
The first move toward high scores was
by Carroll, who made 68, which included
his 25 center previously mentioned. Dr.
Bangs of San Jose pulled up to 70, fol
lowed by Charles Heeth with a like num
ber. They shot off the tie, the San Jose
marksman winning. Dr. L. 0. Rodgers
beat this with 71.
The man target represented the upper
part of a man, the center line being num
bered 20. The other lines were half an
inch apart, the last on each side being
numbered 1. On this there were forty
cash prizes from $30 to $1.
Two of these targets were in use, and
about 160 tickets, four shots to a score,
were sold. R. Finking bet the pace by a
score of 16. 19, 20, 20â75 out of a possible
80. Dr. Rodgers followed by 19, 18, 19,
19â75. For awhile these stood high, but
later F. Baumgartner dropped in with
18, 20, 19, 20â77, which still stands high.
The others who made good scores were:
F. Fay 71, P. Brunotte 70, D.W. McLaugh
lin 70, J. Utschig Sr. 73, F. H. Bushnell
66, A. Junpblut 66, O. V. Biemer 67, Dr. F.
Bangs 65, J. G. Millen 61, A. Strecker 73,
C. Meyer 73, F. Altinger 72.
Probably the greatest interest centered
upon the point or center targets, fourteen
of which were in use. Fully 900 tickets,
eight shots to each, were sold, which shows
that over 7000 bullets were fired to. secure
the forty cash prizes and the twenty-five j
special prizes for most points, etc.
The 12-inch black on these targets was
divided into three points. The 3-inch
center was of card board and when
punctured was detached, numbered and
measured after the shoot. The second
ring counted two points and the outside
ring one. It did not take long to see
that Schuster and Faktor were in a hot
race for the most points.
So keen was the competition that each
marksman shot with two rifles as fast as
he could load. Each had an attendant,
who cleaned and cooled the hot barrels
and kept the marksmen well supplied with
ticket* and ammunition. They shot for
the $40 prize for all they were worth, and
as seen in the foregoing Faktor won by 20
points. A. Strecker and Fred Kuhnle soon
locked horns for the most points, but not
to the extent of the other two.
They were satisfied with one rifle each
and they had no attendants. As Been,
Kuhnle was third with 550 points and
btrecker was fourth with 512 The others

Some Good and Some Poor Scores
at the Rangeâ Foster Cup Shoot
Next Sunday.
Every condition for good shooting pre
vailed at the Shell Mound range yesterday,
but strange to say the scores made by the
companies in regular and practice shoot
were hardly up to the average.
Company L of the First Regiment occu
pied the butts during the morning, the
scores being as follows:
Captain Eggart 43, E. O'Leary 16, A. H.
Breckwaldt 22, H. G, Leffman 33, J. Slattery
15, C. Lnuber 32, H. J. Leffman 15, D. N.

Company A of the Fifth made the best
score of the day so far as the National
Guaid is concerned. Captain Poulter
made the best score, 46, C. Poulter being a
close second with 45. Tne score for the
company is as follows:
A. J. Leech 31. Sergeant McCormick 40, C.

wnich occurs at Shell Mound Park next
Sunday. This trophy was presented to
the Second Artillery last year by Captain
Foster of the North Pacific Coast Railroad
Company. Battery E made the best score
at that time, and are temporarily at least
proprietors of the cup. When the National
Guard was reorganized some months ago
Battery E became Company X of the
Jrtrst Infantry. Twelve men from each
company will compete for the prize, it
finally going to the company winning
three times.

BASE HITS AND ERRORS.
Characteristics of the Ball Game
at the Folsom- Street
Grounds.
; â  , ...... â  .... .
: The San ' Francisco ", ballplayers had on
their batting clothes ' yesterday, and ! the
way they jumped on the delivery of
Pitcher Shea of the Oaklands must have
j made that young man sick at heart. , They
sized { him up for twenty-two safe bits, ',
with a total of thirty-one bases. Sweeney,
Levy and Scott each place a three-bagger
to his credit, and '':â  Sweeney, in â - addition,
secured two doubles and a single out of
five times at bat. Walters,' also, secured a
two- bagger.
" Aside l from the heavy . hitting :of the
' locals, the feature of , : the game was , the ,
poor work of the Oaklands. 'But two of
the entire â  team played without -; an * error. j
Keating at second had seven chances, and
secured . â¢ five 'â ' putouts and * two - assists.

just at the time the San Franciscos got a

YOUNG LADIES
OF THE SODALITY,
Impressive Services at St.
Mary's Cathe
dral.
NUMEROUS MEMBERS.
Father Prendergast, V. G. , Con
fers Upon Them the Blue
Scapular.
FOE CHAEITY AND HUMILITY.
The Blessed Virginâ Sermons Yester
day by Father Doherty and
Father Wayrich.
Twenty-two young ladies were received
into the Sodality of the Immacu
late Conception yesterday in St. Mary'a
Cathedral.
The services began at 3p. m. The blue
scapular was conferred upon the new
comers by the Rev. Father Prender
gast, V. G. Appropriate music was sup
plied by the choir. Father E. P. Dempsey,
in a brief address, exhorted the young
ladies to imitate as clos -ly as possible tlie
holy character of the Blessed Virgin and
to practice in their daily lives the virtues
of purity, obedience, charity and humility.
The benediction was pronounced by
Father J. F. Byrne.
The sodality now has a membership of
some 200, with a fine choir and library. It
holds regular monthly meetings. Fol
lowing are its officers: Miss K. C. Brown
president, Miss Annie Curley vice-presi
dent. Miss Curtin secretary, Miss Emma
O'Leary treasurer, Miss Mamie O'Neil
sacristan, Miss Mamie Quigley organist.
At St. Mary's Church yesterday morn-
Father F. W. Wayrich of New York
preached an instructive sermon from the
text: "Bles-ed are the eyes which see
the tnings that you see."
"God is to be seen," he said, "in the
light of his teachings. A view was given
to the patriarchs.
â¢'Our eyes are blessed when we can see
clearly the fruits of Christianity. The Sa
maritan in the parable is an exemplifica
tion of true Christian charity, which re
gards all men as the children of God.
Charitable institutions were unknown to
the pagan Romans before the coming of
Christianity. It remained for Christianity
to hold forth to the world those heroic
examples, seen in the church of God,
where so many noble men and women
cheerfully give their lives to the care of
God's poor.
"In these charitable institutions there
are no elements of self-interest, no dis
tinctions of race, condition or creed. They
are truly catholic. These latter days have
witnessed violent assaults upon these holy
institutions, but in the life of God's
church persecution is not new. He who
promised that the gates of hell should not
prevail against his church will not permit
the hosts of evil to triumph now, but will
one day open the eyes of those blinded to
the worth of the church and its noble
charities.
"Then will be blessed other eyes, for
they will see the things which you see,
but are not yet discernible to them."
In the evening the Rev. Father F. B.
Doherty preached upon the "Assumption
of the Blessed Virgin," from the text,
"Hail full of grace, the Lord is with thee."
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
A Number of Interesting and Closely
Contested Games Played
Testerday.
The handball courts were, as usual, well
patronized yesterday and several exciting
and interesting games were witnessed.
At the San Francisco court the chief at
traction was a came in which John Rior
dan, the coast champion, and P. Hutchin
son played against J. C. Nealon and G.
Hutchinson. Nealon had been out of
training for some weeks, but he played a
great game. He and his partner were de
feated in the final by only one ace. The
competition among the boys ior the gold
and silver medal presented by Phil Ryan,
the vroprietor of the court, had to be post
poned till next Sundr.y.
At the Union Court Terry McManus
and J. J. Feeney played a great game
against James Nelson and T. Laveile, but
were defeated in the final by three aces,
after a Hard struggle. Much disappoint
ment was felt among the spectators that
the final rub between Joe McAuliffe, the
Mission boy. and Terry McManus did not
come off. Terry was ready and willing,
but Joe failed to put in an appearance and
it was given out that he had "funked."
Terry says that Joe may be a great fighter,
but as a handball-player he is not in his
class, and he is still prepared to uphold
the title of heavy-weight champion against
all comers.
Some interesting games were piayed in
the Mission Athletic Ciub Court among
the members.

In Case of War.
"Supposing," remarked the man who
wears glasses and talks at random, "that
we were to have a war â "
"We're not going to have any such a
thing," replied Keener.
"But supposing we should. What seems
a misfortune would become an advantage.
If we should have a war I wouldn't go, be
cause I'm too near-sighted."
"I wouldn't go, either. I'm too far
sighted."âWashington Star.

EXTRAORDINARY SKILL.
That Is the Kind Required in
Certain Cases.
The Afflicted of San Francisco and
Vicinity Now Have It at Their
Command.
It is often said that San Francisco is
overrun with doctors. That may be true.
It is true. Then why are so many people
sick ?:, Why do they continuously take
medicines, and yet never get well ? '
V Because they secure only ordinary skill,
and ordinary , skill will ". not cure â¢ them.
Chronic, obstinate, deep-seated diseases
require extraordinary methods. They re-
quire expert knowledge, born of great
volumes of experience and practice. They
require the deepest, clearest , possible in-
sight into the mysteries of. human func-
tions, shrouded as they often are in dark-
ness, where the ordinary medical eye sees
little and guesses at facts.
. Doctor â  Cook, the greatest of modern
specialists, has the skill, -â  the experience
and the knowledge required for the sac*
cessful treatment of the worst . cases â  that
afflict suffering humanity. ;If he cannot
cure them no power on earth can.
Doctor Cook treats eye, ear, throat, nose,
brain, liver, lung, heart, stomach, kidney,
bladder. and urinary diseases. He also
cures piles, fits, fistula, rupture, hydrocele,
varicocele, gonorrhoea, gleet, stricture and
syphilis. Special attention , given :to
women who are suffering from womb
trouble, painful or irregular menses, leu-
corrhcea, and other lemale complaints. '
: While Doctor Cook is invariably success-
ful in the treatment of all these troubles,
he devotes himself in particular to the ail-
ments of young, middle-aged and old men,
who, as tne result of errors or excesses, are
tortured by the woes of sexual debility
and premature decay. ' For cases of this
character Doctor Cook has a special treat-
ment of his own, 'which is known to no
other physician in , America" ' and which
has never yet failed to produce the most
gratifying results. Out of the weak and
despondent he makes strong, hopeful men
â men with their power, their pride and
their privileges.. ,
; ; You who are afflicted will do well to con-
sult Doctor Cook immediately and before
your troubles become incurable. If you
cannot call upon him write, as bis system
of home treatment by mail is perfect. His
office hours are 9 to 12 a. m., 2 to 5 and 7 to
Bp. m. Sundays from 10 to 12 a: m.' only.

FOB PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOX VICF-PREBIDEXTâ
GARRET A. HOBA.RT, ef New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
The way to win iÂ« to organize and De
mocracy cannot organize.
Many a Democrat says the tariff is not
an issue, but none of them tell us why.
It seems that in this campaign the Wil
son tariff cannot set even its windmills at
work.
In tbe Eastern States when a man says
he is for Bryan they ask him "Which
Bryan?"
Some folks object to Bryan's youth, but
he seems to be rather old for the amount
he knows.
â¢
The only course open for Bryan is to
drop both Sewall and Watson and play a
lone hand.
Contrast the record of McKinley with
that of Bryan and then make up your
mind how to vote.
A tariff that does not protect the indus
tries of this country will never be satisfac
tory to either its capital or its labor.
When there is plenty of work there is
plenty of money, and the election of Mc-
Kinley will give plenty everywhere.
By the time the campaign is fairly open
the music of protection will swell on every
gale and find an echo in every home.
The liveliest quickstep in the way of
Democratic music thia year will be "Kun,
boys, run, or the tariff will catch yon."
After the campaign is over there will be
money in it for Bryan to travel as a lec
turer with an exhibit of dissolving views.
If the report be true that the mantle of
Jefferson has fallen on Bryan we may as
\vell put it down as the longest fall on
record.
Democracy advises the country not to
monkey with tbe tariff any more, and it
must be admitted that Democracy has had
experience.
As Mr. Bryan is reputed to be a roost
excellent man in private life the New York
Sun very pertinently suggests that he ought
then to stay in private life.
The Cleveland administration stopped
almost all Dusiness except that of the pawn
broker and the Sheriff, but it will be differ
ent after McKinley is inaugurated.
An honest dollar with a chance to earn
it by honest labor is worth more to the
American workingman any day than a
wild-goose dollar with no cHance to catch
iv
The odd thing about the local Demo
cratic factions is that while both are
tarred with the same stick it is impossible
to get them together and make them stick.
There most be something wrong with the
tar.
When you see a man suddenly turn
from his course and walk across the street
don't jump to the conclusion that he is
trying to dodge a dun. He may be only
a Democrat trying to evade the tariff
issue.
McKinley, the champion of prosperity,
and Bryan, the apologist of disaster, stand
in such sharp, well-defined contrast to one
another that no intelligent American needs
a campaign education to teach him how
to vote.
"When you are bunting around for the
chief issue of the campaign don't overlook
the fact that under Republican adminis
trations the country was prosperous and
under Democratic control everything went
to smash.
As Secretary Morton says McKinley is
too much of a bimetailist to suit him, we
would be glad to have Mr. Morton make a
race for the Presidency on the single gold
standard and see how many people -he
would suit.
The Massachusetts Democrat who told
the National Committee of his party,
'"What we want in our State is money and
not Bryan," struck the keynote of the
campaign. The whole country is shout
ing for the same thing.
Sewall and Watson are in the position
of two men who have met on a narrow
path along a precipice where they can
neither pass one another nor turn back.
One must lie down and let the other walk
over him or both must go to destruction
together.
In addition to adopting a platform de
claring for bimetallism the ReDubiican
party placed upon it as a candidate for the
Presidency a man who has both voted and
spoken in favor of a larger use of silver
money, and as a consequence it can rightly
claim the support of every true bimetal
list and every intelligent friead of silier. j
HE IS WORRIED.
The young man from Nebraska is
greatly worried because the people of Xew
fork failed to appreciate the grandeur and
he loftiness of his Madison-square Gar
ien speech, and he proposes to return to
hem and give an oratorical performance
ivhich shall so stir their obtuse minds that
hey will Enow a good thing hereafter
vhen they see it. Mr. Bryan volunteers
in explanation of the circumstances under
which he prepared his notification speech,
md bow it happened that he concluded to
â¢cad it from manuscript. He concludes
lis review of the mental process which
mlminated in so prosy an effort by saying
hat only two persons saw the speech be
'ore he delivered it, and they suggested no
changes. Those who know Mr. Bryan
well will understand why those two per
sons refrained from suggesting changes.
The egotism of the man seems to be
boundless, but if he will allow questions
io be put to him when he essays to answer
Bourke Cockran, he will at least prove to
the public, if not to himself, that his knowl
?dg9 of the science of government is pain
fully superficial. Mr. Bryan's power lies
in daring assertion clothed in pleasing
rhetoric, but when asked to give a logical
reason for his belief he goes to pieces and
presents a wretched spectacle, and, more
over, he cannot quickly recover from em
barrassment. The trouble with Mr. Bryan
is be is not a student.
He jumps at conclusions and relies upon
his matchless oratory to convince his
hearers, ano knowing himself that when
Lt comes to a critical analysis of any of his
propositions he is distressingly weak,
be refuses to be drawn into a col
loquy. In his joint debates, so called, he
always drives ahead with a set speech,
without referring at all to what his oppo
nent says. It needed the Madison-square
liarden speech to show the people how
rambling, uncertain and superficial Mr.
Bryan really is. As a*friend of his once
said, "Will can always have things bis
awn way in a district that is not too large
tor him to run on his shape and oratorical
powers."
As for the obtuseness ,of Mr. Bryan's
New York audience, that is a personal
matter between himself and those who
went out to hear him speak. If they went
out of curiosity and did not enthuse it
was because they were disappointed. If
they went to be edified and failed to see
anything to enlighten them in bis speech,
the fault was Mr. Bryan's, but he labored
under the disadvantage of addressing a
people who are used to listening to really
great men. But Mr. Bryan will make a
great mistake if he crosses swords with
Bourke Cockran. It would be very much
such a spectacle as would be an attack
upon Gibraltar by an unarmored canai
boat, but perhaps the "divinity" which Mr.
Bryan believes is "shaping events" for
bis own and humanity's good is leading
him into a trap from which even his good
luck rabbit's loot would be unable to re
lease him. ______________
PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT FIRST.
Mr. Bland says the free coinage of silver
is of paramount importance because of
the crying necessity for a higher range of
prices for commodities. That opening
the mints to the free and unlimited coin
age of silver dollars would stimulate
prices wonderfully there is no doubt, nor
is there any doubt that the people should
get more money for the product of their
labor; but Mr. Bland's proposition does
not promise any relief. On the contrary
any advance in the price of commodities â
in the cost of livingâ to the people while
they are in enforced idleness would be a
crime.
Since the repeal of protection laws by
the Democratic party there has been a
steady shrinkage in the output of our in
dustrial plants and a corresponding in
crease in the number of idle wage-earners,
and ibis sort of thing is bound to continue
until protection is again secured to our
mills and factories so that they may give
labor an opportunity to earn wages. The
opening of the mints to silver would not
open a shop or a factory, for that which
closed them and which is still keeping
them closed continues to be master of the
situation; we mean the Wilson- Gorman
tariff act. What tbe people want first is
an opportunity to earn money, and there
will be no opportunity until we have a
law that will protect our labor from out
side competition.
Mr. Bland is quite in harmony with
waere-earners and wage-payer-, but what
is the Bense, they want to know, of coin
ing silver dollars until we have removed
the cause of the enforced idleness in the
industrial lines? It is not more money,
nor bimetallism by international or any
other kind of agreement, that is wanted
just now; but what is wanted is the re
vival of our industrial enterprises and
steady employment for labor. When that
is secured let the mints be opened to
silver; but meanwhile do not let us forget
the millions of idle working people who
are begging for an opportunity to earn a
decent living, and who will not have a
decent living until our sources of labor
employment are protected against the
products of cheap foreign labor. We want
silver coinage because, as Mr. Bland says,
it will advance prices of goods and wares,
but we do not want to advance prices until
labor is so employed that it can buy its
supplies at advanced prices. Let us pro
vide work for the idle millions first, and
then take up the money question.
PERSONALITY OF CANDIDATES.
It has always been the custom of the
Republican party to leave the personality
of its candidates for President entirely out
of tbe issue and present its argument to
the people on economic principles. In
selecting candidates their fitness was con
sidered, of coarse, but the party has never
admitted that any particular individual
was necessary to it. The St. Louis con
vention made no departure from that rule,
alt dough the rank and file did express a
very decided preference for Major McKin
ley, but rather for the reason that his
prominent identification with the tariff
act of 1890 would be a double rebuke to the
Democratic party for repealing it and
bringing disaster upon the country, than
because he was superior to all otbei leaders
of the party in statesmanship. The "Mc-
Kinley act" gave the country phenomenal
business prosperity, wniie the act which
superseded it caused commercial wreck
and ruin everywhere, and the people
desired that the act of 1890 should be vin
dicated by the man for whom the act was
named.
But the managers of the Democratic
party are disposed to crowd the person
ality of their candidate to the front at the
expense of their party's declaration of
principles, which is a very foolish thing
to do, for by comparison Mr. Bryan ap
pears a very insignificant individual.
Aside from being his party's choice for
President, Major McKinley has a soldier's
record that is unspotted. His courage,
his devotion to the Union and his influ
ence for good during the dark days of the
rebellion greatly strengthened the cause.
As * statesman Mr. McKiuley stands at
the head, because he demonstrated in
Congress and as Governor of his State
that ho lias no superior as a political

economist. In fact, it may be said that
some of the most important legislation
the country has had since the Declaration
of Independence originated with Major
McKinley, and it may be said, too, that
he is most highly esteemed by the states
men of other countries for his broad and
comprehensive views upon public con
cerns. Major McKinley did not need to
be nominated for President to give him
fame. He bad that already.
Bat how is it with Mr. Bryan? He
served two terms in Congress and be
trayed his party. He made speeches on
the floor of Congress that only amused
members. No one thought them of suf
ficient consequence to warrant a reply.
As a lawyer he failed utterly. He betrayed
his State party into the bauds of the
Populists two years ago. He hired his
name to a newspaper to inveigle farmers
into subscribing for it. He Hired himself
to silver mine owners to "boom" the free
and unlimited coinage of the metal by the
Government. He watched his opportunity
in the Chicago convention to down Bland,
to whose candidacy he was pledged, to
stamDede the delegates to himself. Ac

SPAIN'S BIG BLUFF.
The people of the United States have ex
hibitedLa good deal of sympathy for the
Cuban insurgents, and a good many fili
bustering expeditions have sailed away
from this country with arms and men for
Cuban service. All these things have had
the effect of stimulating the Cubans to
greater effort to secure their independence
âand also to destroy the plantations of
those who were hostile to them. And now
comes Spain making a demand upon the
United States for enough money to cover
all the losses that individuals and the
Government have sustained by reason of
the aid and sympathy our people have ex
tended to the reoels. But Spain has not
collected the bill yet.
It is a little curious that Spain should
make such a claim for it is an admission
that war actually exists in Cuba. Hitherto
tbe Madrid Government has insisted that
the Cuban affair was nothing more than
raids by organized bands of highwaymen,
and that the island was not in a state of
war at all. It cannot be possible that
Spain expects to collect a dofJar from the
United States on account of property de
stroyed in Cuba. There is a bluff game
being played, no doubt, and it is just pos
sible that it all may culminate in serious
trouble between the two nations.
It is safe to say that if Spain has con
cluded that Cuba cannot be conquered, the
better way to let her go would be, the
Madrid Government would naturally con
clude, to make a war with the United
States an excuse for it; besides, were
Spain to admit her inability to subjugate
the Cuban rebels she would have a re
bellion at home to overthrow the king
dom, and hence a war with the United
States would be a good thing to quiet the
republicans in the home country and fur
nish an excuse for releasing Cuba.
But whatever the purpose may be in
filing claims that would probably aggre
gate $50,000,000, it is clear there is no ex
pectation that the United States could be
persuaded to pay a nickel. Tho people
of this country would make life a burden
to any administration that would give
Spain aid and comfort in her war upon the
Cuban republic, and it is a republio by
Spain's own admission. Claims for dam
ages are not filed until the troubles are all
over and tbe amount of the damages as
certained, but in this case there is a de
mand without the slightest intimation of
bow much money is wanted. Our diplo
matic service at Washington is weak and
lame, but the people will take the- matter
into their own hands when the time
comes. ________________

The new editor of the Los Gatos Mail has
swung his publication into line for the genuine
American policy of a protective tariff. tie is
inclined to a belief in the free coinage of
American silver, but he \ tempers belief with
reason. In fact, be contends that "while the
free coinage of our silver at the ratio of 16 to
1 may be a safe venture, we know that a high
protective " tariff \ for American j products is a
safe system for the people of , the United States
to maintain." 'Considering that "under the
existing mixed : conditions of \ our political
affairs,' lt seems almost impossible to harmon
ize these two predominant, popular, American
ideas," he deems protection "the first-to-be
[ chosen safeguard of the Nationâ to start ; the
now rusting machinery .: of our .country , into
activity"â and trusts '.''to see bimetallism fol
low in its wake as soon as such a course is
warranted by the intelligence of the majority
of the American people." "

California. The Suman mills of Colton are to
be removed to this city and additional ware
houses and offices added, so that the plant frill
be a large and fully equipped one. The j mill
at Colton will be torn down and moved to its

A project is n*ow under way which may re
sult in giving to Los Banos the fame of being
the center of the largest irrigation system in
the. State. Henry Miller, the cattle king, is the
prime mover in the matter, and his surveyors
are already at work. The Los Banos Enterprise
says: "There are two courses under considera
tion, one to run the water up along the foot
hills, and another to rua it a considerable dis
tance lower down, taking in about three
fourths the amount of land. In order to take
in allthe vast plains below the foothills it will
be necessary to build a flume for some distance
at the upper end of the canal, which will of
course make the expense much greater. But,
however, we think it would pay better in the
long run, as much territory could be suppliea
with water. If the large canal is built it will
take in nearly a hundred thousand acres of
land that haa no superior in the State."
With reference to the same subject the Mer
ced Star remarks: '-The building of this canal
will mean mucn for the residents of the West
Side and is an enterprise of great interest to
the entire county.
"Mr. Miller has taken a deep interest in the
advancement of the business interests ot that
section of the county. He has the capital and
the business energy to push such a proposition
to final success. It is to be hoped that he will
decide in favor of the larger canal if it proves
to be a practical possiDility, as it will open up
for settlement and cultivation vast tracts of
land of the finest quality that is now practically
valueless for agrarian purposes for lack of
water for irrigation.
'lirtie building and operation of the proposed
canal system will advance the value of land
on the West Side, bring many desirable resi
dents into the county and open up an era of
prosperity that will be of inestimable advan
tage to Los Banos and its surrounding coun
try. The machinery to be used in building
the canal is now at Firebaugh. The work will
be commenced this month and will be vigor
ously pushed to completion. If the plans can
be carried out as at present proposed water
will be ready for delivery in January next."

Of immense value to the State of California
will be the success of a company which has
been organized to work the iron deposits of
theMcCloud River. The' Redding Free Press
speaks as follows with reference to the im
portant matter: "George Senn, one of the
promoters of the scheme, with Mr. Bruson,
says that he does not want to talk about the
plans of the company, but we have learned
enough of the undertaking to know that if it is
practicable it will revolutionize the iron in
dustry in this State. The process by which it
is proposed to turn raw iron ore into piglron
and steel is owned by Mr. Bruson, who, for
seven years made experiments with electricity
in Alabama, during that time building no less
than seven dynamos before he coulu produce
the required kind of electricity, which is alto
gether different from the ordinary dynamo
furnishing power for electric lighting. By his
dynamo a wire capable of producing 40,000
horsepower can be taken hold of without in
jury by the naked hand. As it is explained,
there is a decrease in voltage, but an increase
in amperes.
"When we take into consideration that all
the iron used in the State is imported, we can
begin to estimate the Value to the State of the
plant wnich this company proposes to erect.
"Sever P \ surveys have been made, but the
details have not by any means been settled.
Just where the t>lant will be located has not
yet been decided, but probably it will be put
on the Sacramento River above Kennet, and a
narrow-gauge road built to connect with the
mines. Water power will be used to set tha
dynamos in motion, but just where has not
been decided.
"Mr. Senn says that all the foundry men and
iron workers in San Francisco will watch the
results of this process, for it means much to
them in cheapened product, and to Shasta
County it means a busy hive of indmtry and
great advance in real values.
"In addition to the plant to convert iron ore
into the raw product, it is proposed to erect a
small plant to work precious ores, it being
claimed that by Mr. Bruson's process the cop
per ores of Iron Mountain can be smelted and
the copper, gold an 1 silver extracted separate
from each other and perfectly pure."

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Ex-Superior Judge Charles F. Lott of Butte
County is among the arrivals at the Lick. He
came down about a week ago on a matter of
business, and would have gone home ere this
but he is feeling a little under the weather
and looking pale. â 
The long residence of the Judge at Oroville,
combined with the acquaintanceship which
resulted from his years on the bench and on
the stump in political campaigns, has caused
him to become one of the best-known men in
California.
His snow-white hair and beard serve to make
him conspicuous in the corridors also, and
Ex-Superior Judge Charles F, 1 ott of Oroville, for Forty Years a Resident of
Butte County.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
not infrequently he is the center of a crowd.
He came to California forty-seven years ago
and for forty years baa resided continuously
in But te.
"ThÂ« orange crop in Butte County this year,"
said the Judge, "is short, and it is the same
way with other rruit and with hay. oats and
wheat. I think the yieid is about 70 or 75 per
cent.
"As to mining, work has been resumed on
Feather River nnd there is a hope that con
siderable gold will be got out. The force of
men is not very large. It is a good thing for
Butte, however. As to politics there is no
great excitement, but the farmers and miners
are all for silver. The gold-miners are the
same as the others.
"There are some improvements in Oroville
now that add to the town's appearance. Con
tracts have lately been lot for the erection of
four new residences and also for several
stores. One large business-nouse is to be con
structed where four or five old buildings have
hitherto stood. In the building way Oroville
is doing very fairly."

higher a build already on the table, but to
take it the one who made the first build must
take it with a. card of value of the increased
build.
Bankingâ Reader, Dixon. At this time the
banks of California do business on a gold Vasis
and It is understood that they propose to con
tinue so doing. That portion of your question
as to what could or what could not be dona
under certain circumstances is a matter for a
court to determine, and this department does
not give judicial decisions.
Biedsâ M. S. R., City. Ornitholigists say
that it is impossible in the majority of cases
to determine the character of the bira by the
egg found in the nest. The bird you describe
in your communication is probably the warb
ling vireo, which resembles a house finch, has
a white breast and green yellowish winsrs and
back. It buiHs its neÃts in just such places as
you describe. .
Popular Voteâ T. J., Carlilc, Fresno County,
Cal. At the Presidential election held in
1892 the popular vote was as follows: Total
popular vote, including scattering, 12,110,
--636. Cleveland received 5,556,918, Harrison
5,176,108, Weaver (Pop.) 1,041.028, Bidwell

Cleveland's popular vote over Harrison 380,

The Yacht Raceâ R. E. W., City. The race
between the Valkyrie and the Defender was
awarded to the Defender because the Defender
won the first race, waa allowed the second race
because the English boat fouled her at the
start, and because the Defender in the third
race went over the course alone, after the Val
kyria had crossed the line. It is possible that
a New York paper published that it was "no
race," but that was not the decision of those
who were called upon to pass on the result.

THE COMING OF
A BIG LOG RAFT,
It Contains the Piling for
the New Union Ferry-
Depot.
LEFT ASTORIA SATURDAY

High on Jackson-Street
Wharf.
PACKAGES THROWN OVERBOARD
A Lost and Bewildered Band of Sheep
That Followed a Tall
Policeman.
A monster raft of logs, the largest ever
floated into this harbor, will come down
from Stella, a lumber port on the Colum
bia River, to-morrow or next day. It will
contain 560,000 iineal feet of piling, all of
which will be used in the construction of
the ferry-slips of the new union depot and
other work on the water front.
The great raft is cigar-shaped, about 500
feet long, with 50 feet beam and a depth of
30 feet. Nearly sixty tons of chain have
been used to bind the immense bundle of i
piles together, and the manner in which
they are bound in one compact mass is
most ingenious.
The chains are run lengthwise, cross
wise and in every way imaginable to re
sist the twisting blows of the waves.
The first raft started from the Columbia
River to this City several years ago went
to pieces, entailing- a great loss on the
owners, who adopted that cheap and :
practical method of getting their lumber
to market.
The logs are piled into the proper shape
in an immense cradle, which is built in
the water. The huge spruce tree-trunks
are floated into this space and "jecked"
into position, and as log is heaped upon
log; the mass sinks, permitting the con
struction of the raft to progress compara
tively without difficulty.
Tnis cradle device has been patented by .
the owners in order to protect their raft
industry against competition. The en

tire concern has cost them $30,000, includ
ing insurance and towage.
The second raft was successfully brought
to San Francisco by the steamer Minola
last year and sold to the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company. All three were built
by Bains & Kobertson of Stella, the first
two with the assistance of outside capital.
The tirm has undertaken this third ven
ture alone.
The raft was floated to Astoria last Sat
urday, thence out to Â«ea by the tug Ac
tive, when it was taken in tow by the
Minola for this harbor.
The produce glut is on again and the
water front is jammed with fruit. Great
heaps are piled on Jackson and Washinz
ton street wharves, and the surplus is stjll
growing. The commission dealers are |
standing around among their overflowing j
baskets, boxes and crates and wondering
what is to be done with the consignments
that come to them almost every hour.
Yesterday a large number of peaches
and pears were thrown overboard and the
tide carried them up tne bay â possibly on
up the Sacramento River to the ranches
from which they were fhipped.
The packages are piled hi<?h toward the ;
freightshed roofs, and the nock employes
are shifting them around trying to make
space for the coming consignments.
The dealers say that if the shippers will
hold their fruit for a few days the market
-will be somewhat clear, but to continue
the rush into the City will only necessi
tate the dnmpin.2 of much of the ship
ments into the bay.
The British* ship Port Douglas arrived
yesterday, 147 days from Antwerp, On
the passage John Hoimoerg, seaman, was
washed off the jibboom during rough
weather, and drowned. He was a native
of Sweden, aged 37. J. Tamm, seaman,
26 years old, died of heart disease and was
buried at eea.
' Chief Steward Benjamin Crosby of the
City of Para died of heart-disease on the
6th ir.st., during the voyage of the steamer

died on June 26, and was buried at sea.
A bewildered band of s-heep, on their
way to Butchertown, created considerable
amusement for a gang of boys and trouble

chase.

A BIG REWARD OFFERED
Woo Kee at Swords' Points With
the * Sewing Union " or
Cum Yee Tong.
SHUN MOH'3 NARROW ESCAPE.
Fire Marshal Towe Will Spare No
Pains to Bring the Culprit
to Justice.
Fire Marshal Towe has not as yet found
the Chinese who attempted to set fire to
the overall factory of Shun Mon at 509)4
Washington street on the night of Friday
last. He has learned, however, that an
other Chinese overall factory conducted
by Woo Kee at 41G Battery street has
been threatened by the organization com
posed of Chinese laborers that is supposed
to be at the bottom of the attack on Shun
Mon.
It was stated last night by several Cni
nese merchants that this organization has
a membership of about 600 Chinese.
It is known as the Sewing Union, or the
Cum Yee Tong Society. The present presi
dent is one Long Li, who has yet three
months to serve as governor of the so
ciety's schemes, and it was also stated that
Long Li is a meraber of the highbinders'
society. It seems that Woo Kee has been
twice accused within the past two weeks;
first of some indefinite offense, expressed
in Chinese-English as being a "scoundrel,"
and second of embezzlement. His case on
this latter charge will come up in court
next Friday. This case was entered at the
instance of Wang Long.
Wa Shing, who haS an overall factory at
413 Commercial street, and who is a
brother of Sbung Mon, hires now only
union men, but last year he had trouble
with the Sewing Union, and a price wa3
put on his head by this society. This diffi
culty was, however, smoothed over.
The elaborate and cumbersome inge
nuity of the Chinese brain is well illus
trated in the odd infernal machine that
was found in Sbung Mon's stairway.
In imagination the murderous coolie
who devised the scheme saw the oil from
the bottle running out drop by drop, sat
urating the dry, worm-eaten floor. The
fire on the punk all this time eating its
way down to the sulphurous heads of the
matches which, igniting, would burn long
and fiercely enough to set fire to the boards
of the floor.
The fact of the oil running down the
punksticks and extinguishing their fire
did not occur to bim. Therefore his dia
bolical scheme failed.
"Shun Mon," said Fire Marshal Towe,
"is as brave as a lion. He is the whitest
Chinaman I have ever mot. I will follow
this thing as far as possible. This reward
of $250 will do much toward finding tbe
culprit. I have let it be known that the
man who gives me correct information on
this need not be known nor serve as a wit
ness.
"Section 109 of order 2927 of the Fire
Code gives me full authority to give this
reward. It is a very difficult matter,
though, to get a clew from Chinamen. It
is always 'No sabe'; then they shut their
mouths like clams.
"It is a new thing for the Chinese to re
sort to incendiarism. There are com
paratively few fires in Chinatown. This
building in which is Shun Mon's foctory
is one of the worst firetraps in town. Had
the building really been fired he weuld
have undoubtedly lost his life."
AT THE PLAYHOUSES.
The Attractions That Are Offered for
This Evening at the Various City
Theaters.
"The Gay Parisians," to be presented at
the Baldwin Theater this evening, is one
that had a run of 200 nights in Mew York
and was on for 100 at Boston. William J.
Furgeson and Sadie Martinot will appear
in tne leading parts.
"The Great Unknown" has done so well
at the Columbia Tneater the management
has decided to keep the play on this even
ing and for the balance of the week. When
a good play draws the management of this
house knows better than take it off.
"The Minstrel of Clare," to be offered at
the California Theater to-night with
Chauncey Olcott in the lead, is a new play,
one that met with much success in the
East. In this play Olcott will sing several
songs, including "Home," a very popular
one. A delegation of the Knights of the
Red Branch will attend to bqow their ap
preciation of Mr. Olcott.
The favorite opera, "It Trovatore," is
what tbe management of the Tivoli Opera
house will offer to the patron? of that
bouse to-night. Miss Flora Finlayson,
prima donna contralto, will make her first
appearance this evening, supported by
the members of the company.
That interesting naval play, "The En
sign," is what those who go to the Grand
Opera-House to-night will see. It is a
play that is full of love, patriotism and
loyalty to the American flag. James M.
Brophy will appear in the title role.
There are many attractive features at
the Orpheum, but "the" show at this time
is Kennedy, the hypnotist, whose antics
with people under his will create roars of
laughter. Miss MiJdred Howard is to ap
pear to-night in her sensational Trilby
dance.
The doors of the Macdonough Theater
in Oakland, which have been closed for
some time, will be reopened this evening
wita the Empire stock company, which
will present that sterling play, "The
Masqueraders." On Tuesday "Bohemia"
will be given.
There will be plenty of outdoor and in
door amusement at the Chutes to-night.
Rides on the'ehutes or on the great scenic
railway are very enjoyable, and the enter
tainment in the Casino is always of an in
teresting character.

cessâ Another Next Sunday.

River red woods yesterday was a grand
success.
Every seat on the train of ten cars and

applicants bad to tn refused tickets, be
cause the train was limited. As it was, it
required two of the heaviest engines of the
North Pacific Coast Railroad to whirl the

to belp out on the heavy grades.
The arrangements were complete for the
comfort of the excursionists, and Mr.
Locke received many congratulations for
fats success in conducting his excursions
on modern lines. It was a strictly first
class party, such as is generally seen on
week-day excursions, and a noticeable
feature was the absence of boisterous
people.

OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDY.
When Artists Return From Meeker
Grove a Dinner Will Be Given
to Fred Yates.
The picture painted Dy William Keith,
which so fascinated Fred Yates, will be
placed on exhibition in this City and then
sent to London. Mr. Yates has visited
the school of design at the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art and talked with many of
the resident artists since his arrival last
Wednesday. He recognizes that San
Francisco artists are doing excellent work
and speaks highly of the advantages
which the San Francisco Art Association
peesents to students on the Pacific Coast.
A dinner In honor of Mr. Yates will be
given at the Bohemian Club, but tne event
will not occnr untii tne artists who are
now in the redwoods of the Russian River
return. The preparations for the midsum
mer high jinks have called many artists
to Meeker's grove.
Mr. Yates' studio in London is visited
by many Americans, and he has had the
pleasure of entertaining Mark Twain,
Alexander Harrison, Theodore Wores, and
others, there. When he returns to Eng
land he will probably paint the portrait
of Jerome K. Jerome. He has several
commissions in tbe United States, so he
may not sail from New York until late in
October.
His sojourn in San Francisco after an
absence of seven years affords him special
delight. Nevertheless, he records the ob
servation that as a young artist in this
City he had many a hard struggle to keep
the wolf from the door of bis domicile.
Recalling his ea?ly experiences as a
student, he says now that he earned in
Italy more knowledge in the art of paint
ing portraits than he ever acquired in
France.
Mr. Yates is a member of the Hogarth
Club and the New English Art Club of
London. From the latter organization
several of the associate members of the
Royal Academy have recently been drawn.
His first offering to the Royal Academy,
which be regarded as an excellent head,
was "chucked." Yates called Shannon to
see the picture and explain wherein it
was deficient. Shannon asserted that in
Eneland there were not six men who
could surpass the work, therefore he ad
vised Yates to persevere. Tbe result of
the persevering was the admission of sub
sequent pictures to the academy.

"A Lfon in the Way." He spoke of the
lion as being the many forms of wicked
ness in our community. "Indolence pro
duces cowardice," said he. "What we
want to do is to take the lion out of our
way, as David did when the wild beasts
attacked his flock.
"Danger is no excuse for indolence," he
continued. "We find the lion on nearly
every street corner, the saloon. Another
lion is the bouse of shame that goes hand
in hand with the saloon. It is the duty of
every citizen to see that these dens are
taken out of the way.
"Danger," he concluded, "will disappear
when you face it It is better to be de
vonred trying to conquer the lion than be
slain by it while lying idle."

WHITHER ARE
WE DRIFTING ?
Rev. F. K. Baker Sees Por
tentous Perils Ahead
for This Country.
GODLESS REFORM FOLLY.
The Speaker Denounces Anarchy
as a Vicious and Impotent
Attempt at Relief.
"ROME MUST REFOBM OR DIE."
The American People Declared to Be
Calling Upon the Hierarchy
to Change Its Course.
Key. P. K. Baker, pastor of the Ep
worth M. E. Church, was the speaker at
the Good Citizenship meeting yesterday
afternoon. His subject was, "Whither Are
We Drifting?"
"There are perils confronting this coun
try," he said, "and it is no citizen â and a
preacher is a citizen â has a right to be si
lent. The pulpit and the press â those
two mighty arms of reform â ought to
reach out to save the country.
"One of these perils is socialism. Un
derstand me, when 1 say socialism I mean
socialism gone mad; attempts at reform
by violence. This form of socialism, if
we can call it so, for I believe in true so
cialism, is an enemy of the home and an
enemy of the school. With anarchy the
theory is that might means right. The
snare by spirit is indigenous to foreign
soil, and almost all the troubles that
threaten this country are the result of for
eign immigration.
"We cannot afford- to put our country
into the hands of such a lawless atheistic
band. I have no faith in godless reforms
or movements. True religion is the basis
of private virtue and happiness, of pros
perity and honor in the Nation. To build
a nation on moral corruption is to build it
on dynamite. Whatever lowers the Na
tional tone is a great calamity. This
anarchy is a vicious desire to live without
God, without anything.
"Another peril is social dishonesty and
impiety. We need a moral crusade to
clean out our political offices. Our Super
visors and other officials will do just as
they please until the citizens shall stamp
their feet and say this thing must stop.
We need more Parkhurets to clean out our
municipal institutions.
"We need to have our streets cleared of
indecent show-bills and exhibitions tnat
make a decent man's blood boil. Every
murderer, whether of life or of virtue,
should be made to forfeit his life for the
lite he has taken.
"Mammon is another of the perils that
confront us. The question cf supreme im
portance to-day i 3, 'What is there in it for
me?' The golden calf ha- kicked out the
good sense of a good many. We are ap
parently drifting toward an oligarchy of
money. Hoarding money is abusing it.
Money should not be made a basis of so
cial precedence. A system which permits
the accumulation of wealth in the hands
of incorporations or individuals is wrone.
"Another portentous evil is the influence
of Bacchus. It 19 the worst enemy of the
laboring man to-day. Chain the drink
monster and all other questions of moral
and social government would largely set
tle themselves. Gambling is a peril also
threatening our Government.
'"The last but not the least portentous of
the evils threatening our land is the
Roman hierarchy. Ecclesiasticlsm in sec
ular affairs is the aim of that church. It
has been alone through Rome's conduct
that the American people have arisen,
calline her to stop meddling with our pub
lic schooN and with our beloved flag. The
principles of the Roman hierarchy have
always been the same. If it be afraid to
face its past history why does it continue
to adhere to the principles that have made
that history possible.
"Rome in America must reform or die.
The chances are in favor of death, because
Rome cannot stami reform. The very
thing which she must reform is her life
itself. The education of the masses should
be American, and foreigners, and people
wlio are born in this country, too, should
be made to keep their mouths closed about
our public schools."
The speaker, in conclusion, lamented
the fact that the lowest men were allowed
to vote, while "our noblest citizens, our
wives and mothers, are refused the ballot."

PRIMARY VOTE,
Control of the County Com

Battle.
PRECEDENT OF A JUDGE
A Little Speech to Reporters
That Was Duly Ap
preciated.
COLORED CITIZENS' STANDING.
Fred Stratton , Says Politics Are a
Distinct Detriment to a
Lawyer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aujr, 16. f
The great Congressional primary is over
and partisans are not now wasting the
time in congratulating HUborn or condol
ing with Frick. They are already looking
to the future ana trying to figure out what
effect yesterday's work will have on the
coming County Convention. The "reform"
party is at present victorious and will as
suredly name the next Congressional Com
mittee. The county committee is of vastly
more importance to the element that
would rule in Aiameda County, and in a
few weeks' time the battle for its control
will have to be fought, and it will be more
bitterly contested than was the primary
of yesterday. The Frick element will need
to fight hard as it is no secret that the
strength of the old liners as developed
yesterday was a surprise to tne new fac
tion. Now that the Congressional fight is
disposed of Frick and Hilborn will hardly
be mentioned, but the fight for life will be
none the less torrid.
There are several interesting features in
the result of yesterday's fight, and al
though Fries only obtained nine out of
forty-seven delegates, it would be very
erroneous to suppose that these figures
represent their proportionate strength.
The exact proportion is really five to six
when the whole vote of the county is con
sidered. Out of nearly 12,000 vote?, Hil
born's majority was but 1001. These figures
show how evenly the party is divided as
between the merits of the two men. To
equalize these respective strengths or even
to turn the balance of power is a task not
at all formidable to some Aiameda County
politicians, and as ability to manage af
fairs is about as equally divided as the
votes, nothing further is needed to show
how keen will be the fight for the control
of the county committee. Hints are being
dropped that the Republican votes for
Congress will be as divided as at yester
day's primaries. Such work is heartily
condemned by who undoubtedly
will vote for his Jate opponent.
There is more Republicanism than per
sonality in the party in this county, and
for any one to insinuate that men like "W.
H. Chickering, George W. Reed, Victor
Metcall', Dr. Fisher and Dr. J. P. Dunn
will vote anything but the regular Re
publican ticket is the veriest kind of folly.
Judge Greene set a precedent for officials
this week that mignt well be followed by
many others in the county offices. It has
been customary for the most mysterious
secrecy to be observed in connection with
all Grand Jury indictments.
Judge Greene rather surprised the news
paper men, who were waiting to hear the
report of the Grand Jury last Wednesday.
"For the benefit of the press," he said,
"I will say that the Grand Jury has re
turned nine indictments. As you know,
gentlemen, the names of the parties can
not be made public under the law until
they are arrested." The usual practice is
to carry off the papers with as much
secrecy as though they were death war
rants issued by some local eonncil of ten
Judge Greene is one o.' the few county offi
cials who do not consider the average
newspaper correspondent particularly in
ferior to the average political office-holder
in the matter of discretion.
Fred 8. Stratton has contributed an
article to the Hifh School magazine
which should be read by the hundreds oi
youths who are considering the advisa
bihty of entering the law, politics or the
university. Fred w*s a High School gradu
ate of the centennial year class.
"The pursuit of politics," says Mr.
Stratton, is not, in cities at least, ol any
assistance to the attorney as such. It ia
rattier a distinct detriment. Political
success seldom brings desirable clients,
and this should be thoroughly understood
by the legal student. In the early years,
however, politics may with propriety be
cultivated merely as an introduction to
the public and as a means of enlarging
acquaintance.
"To prepare for the law nothing is more
requisite than a careful preliminary edu
cation extending, if possible, through the
university. As to the latter, however,
success is often obtained ,withoutit. Too
many young men are anxious to econo
mize the three or four years passed in a
higher collegiate course. This, however,
unless a matter of strict necessity, is a
mistake."
After reading the above remarks it is in
teresting to iearn that Attorney Btratton
i 3 doing his best to get a seat in tne next
Senate.
The position occupied by the colored
citizens of this county was very clearly
shown when they had their day at the
exposition last week. The musical di
rector arranged a programme that was
suggestive of a Georgia Barbary Coast.
"Cakewalk," "Whistling Coon," "Black
Brigade" and "Ma Angeline" figured con
spicuously. As the idea of the manage
ment was to turn the programme over to
the colored citizens and let the race show
to tne best possible advantage, a protest
-was entered against the apparent though
unintentional insult, and the result
showed the wisdom of according the re
spect due the race to its local representa
tives.
The evening was one of music, song and
oratory and was enjoyed by a packed
louse, who were unanimously of the
opinion that the talent was equal to any
that has vet been furnished at the exposi
tion. When the Black Patti sang Friday
afternoon one of the most cultured audi
ences that could be gathered in this city
applauded her. "Dat New Bully" has no

WITH THE UNITARIANS.
The Berkeley Christian Bible
Seminary Will Occupy
Stiles Hall.
Another Religious Sect Is Now Es
tablished ia the University
Students' Buildiog.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 16.â The new
Berkeley Bible Seminary will open to
morrow and will occupy during the first
year the upper auditorium of Stiles Hall.
Tbe establishment of this school of the
Christian church in Stiles Hall gives the
Unitarians a companion sect in a possible
reopening of the fierce controversy that
has raged with regard to the propriety of
allowing religious services of a certain
I creed to' be held in the hall, which is a
' university building. Orthodox divines of
i Berkeley have more than once vigorously
protested against the rental of the hall to
Unitarians.
"I do not know that there has been any
opposition to our occupying the hall,"
said Dr. Jefferson, president of the semi
nary. "At any rate, our contract to rent
the auditorium is closed, and so I suppose
the matter is settled.*'
About twenty students will enter for
the first year. Regular classes will be or
j ganited to-morrow in Old Testament, his
tory and literature, and in the life of
Christ, Dr. Jefferson will deliver a course
of lectures on "The Importance, Princi
j pies and Methods of Biblical Study."
I These lectures will be delivered on
Wednesday afternoons at 4 o'clocK, unless
another hour shall be found to be more
desirable.
All the classes and lectures are open not
only to regular students of the seminary,
but also to all other persons who desire to
attend. No tuition or other fees are
charged by the seminary for any of the
work, and all persons are welcome to avail
themselves of its advantages.
Tbe seminary is supported by an en
dowment, and is in Berkeley for the good
it can do.
The College of Mines.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 16.â An unusu
ally large proportion of the new class at the
State University are students in the min
ing college, which appears to be enjoying
a sort of boom.
"The increase in the number of mining
students is the result of the favorable loca
tion of the university in one of the most
interesting mining regions of the world."
said Professor Senger, chairman of the
faculty committee on students' creden
tials. "The college bids fair to grew into
one of the greatest mining colleges in the
world.
"The university class of 1900 will be
slightly larger than that of '99. In spite
of severe entrance requirements, the num
ber of admissions to lreshman standing at
present exceeds the total admission to
freshman standing during the last college
year. The number of graduate students
veil! also be larger than during the year
1895-96."
To-morrow the freshmen will register,
and on Tuesday they will be addressed by
the president ot the university.

Old Landmark Gone.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 16.â The old
Newport House, owned by John Winfield,
at the corner of Centrai avenue, near Sec

was $3000. The property is supposed to
have been fully insured.
The fire was caused by an explosion of
coal oil, the alarm being turned in at 10:30
o'clock from box 12.
The house was an old landmark of the
West End, and was well known when the
Newport baths near it were nourishing.
Training of a Soul.
Rev. Dr. Dille in his sermon lest night com"
pared the training of the soul for heaven to
the training of an athlete who contemplates
the winning of a prize. The latter must divest
himself of all superfluous flesh so that his
limbs may be free and his muscles be given
full play. The former must divest himself of
his cumbersome sins, otherwise he may stum
tie and fall and so never reach the goal.
"He who falls in a race," said he, "throws
others that follow him, therefore all should
be so trained that the danger of stumbling
rices not exist."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 1896.
THE COUNTY TO
FIGHT THE CITY.
Murray Township Wants
to Name a Superior
Judge.
OAKLAND TAKES IT ALL.
The Interior Demands Recogni
tion on the \Republi
can Ticket.
LANGAN THEIR FAVORITE.
Only Two Judges to Be Elected and
Already There Are Sev
eral Candidates.
Oakland Office San Fratccisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 16. f
The interior of the county has decided
that all the nominations at the disposal of
George W. Langan of Livermore, Who Is Favored by the Interior of the County
as Judge Prick's
the Republican party shall not in the
futare be gobbled up by Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley, as in the past.
Murray township has declared that it
must have one of the two nominations
that will be made at the County Conven
tion for Superior Judge. In their demand
they are sustained by the other townships,
and so the man who expects the support
of fully half of the Republicans of Ala
meda County must not ignore the upper
country in his plans.
With unfailing regularity the delegates
from the townships have gone to county
conventions and have meekly submitted
to the demands of the managers of candi
dates. Each time they have been told
that no man from the interior could hope
to be elected and that the country would
be recognized next time.
'While this statement is not absolutely
true, it is nearly so. Two years ago the
nomination for County Treasurer was
given to Joseph Herrscher of San Leanuro,
but as it was yielded from policy rather
than merit. Herrscher failed of election, as
the men who nominated him expected
that be would.
The man who is now put forward by
Murray Township is George W. Langan of
Livermore, whom they want to receive a
nomination for Superior Judge. Two of
the Superior Judges will retire this year,
and already there are several candidates
for the nominations.
Judges Frick and Greene are the retiring
jurists, but Frick will not try to succeed
nimself, having had his share of the
party's support in his struggle for the Con
gressional nomination, but Judge Greene
will be again in the field. Sam P. Hall
and W. L. Hill are already in the field, and
if the demand of the interior is granted
the fight in Oakland will be very bitter.
G. W. Langan is a member of the Army
and Navy Republican League, and has a
strong following in the townships. Unless
the four-year term be held to be invalid
there will be so few county nominations to
be made at the approaching convention
that Livermore will have to fight hard for
a share.
TALKED OF THE HINDOO.
Missionary James C. Perkins, Native
Son and Graduate of Berkeley.
James C. .Pencina, a graduate of the
University of California in 1874, a lawyer
in this City for four years and a mission
ary in Southern India for the last ten and
a half years, addressed a meeting in the
Y. M. C. A. building yesterday afternoon.
He spoke of Hindooi^m and its fallacies,
and he told of the self-sacrifice of some of
the high-caste men, who, having pro
fessed Christianity, heroically bear all the
indignities heaped upon them by their fel
low-countrymen of the ancestral religion
of India.
One instance he cited. He and several
other missionary clergymen were out on a
street corner talking raDidly, toy turn, in
order to hold the attention of their au
dience, for the warm weather is not con
ducive to the maintenance for any length
of time of a street crowd.
As they talked in a Salvation Army
style of the Christ and of the religion of
salvation they watched for faces in the
crowd that seemed to be impressed with
the discourse. They saw one man evi
dently deeply interested. They ap
proached him and engaged him in con
versation. He was an intellectual and edu
cated Hindoo of the highest caste, and a
man of great wealth. He had no children;
his home life was happy. So neither the
advantages of the Christian schools for
children or the shelter of the church for a
forlorn soul affected his desire for Christ
ianity. Furthermore, in bis neighbor
hood the congregation of the Christian
church was made up of low caste men.
Notwithstanding this he humbled his
pride and was baptized. Subsequently,
extensive acres that he owned, that had
been in the possession of his family for
generations, but which were ret officially
recorded were levied upon. He was re
quested to establish his claim by wit
nesses, the usual mode. Not a native
would testify in his behalf, and the prop
erty went to the Government by default.
His cattle were poisoned.
He was tormented in every way, and all
because of his faith. He bore it lor a year.
He endured it for three, for five years; he
is still holdine steadfastly to the religion
of Christ. But all Hindoos are not like
this one. There are zealous Christians
among them ; there are lukewarm Chris
tians; there are hypocrites. Humanity is
the same in India as in America.
Mr. Perkins believes that the reclama
tion of India from the narrowing effects of
! Hindooism with its insurmountable
system of castes will be accomplished in
time by Christianity and largely by the
railroads, tbe castes being compelled to
mingle to a certain extent during railroad
travel. He is the first graduate of the
State University who ever went into the
missionary field. Fifteen years ago he
became a Christian and gave up the law
for the ministry. Mr. Perkins was born
in Sacramento. He arrived here about
five weeks ago from India and will remain
here about five weeks longer. In March
he purposes to return to his work in
Madura, Southern India.
MARTHA SCHOFIELD HERE.
Founder of the Schofleld Normal and
Industrial School gpeakg of Her Work.
Martha Schofield, the founder of the
Schofield Normal and Industrial School
for colored students, at Aiken, South Car
olina, is at the Occidental Hotel.
Yesterday she attended Friends' meeting
and after services gave a short sketch of
the institution founded by her in 1868, she
having entered upon the work in 1865.
The'school has over 250 students, 70 of
whom board at the school and are being
taught to be better home-makers and bet
ter citizens. . _
The several industrial departments, such
as printing, harness-making, carpenter
ing, store-keeping and farming, are all
doing excellent work.
The eirls are taught cooking, sewing,
laundrywork and housekeeping.
"Scores of young men and women from
distant parts of the State write for work
that may enabie tnem to enjoy the educa-
tional facilities afforded by the institu
tion.
Tne institution has a small endowment,
and is chartered and held by trustees. But
the running expenses are raised chiefly
by the efforts of the founder. The man
agement never runs in debt, and is thank
ful for any donations or even a spirit of
well wishing and words of encourage
ment.
FIRE AT POWDER WORKS
Cause of More Damage Than
Was Done by the Flames
to the Acid-House.
Superintendent Pollock and James
Garrity Thrown Out of a Buggy
and Seriously Injured.
Oakland Office San Feancisoo Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 16. f
The alarm given for a fire last niÂ«ht at
the California Powder Works was the
cause of a very serious accident, and two
men are nursing broken bones as the con
sequence.
Late last night a fire was discovered in
the nitric acid house of the powder works.
Word was at once sent to Superintendent
Pollock, who lives at Pinole, and he started
for the works. He was accompanied by
James Garrity, and the exigency of the
occasion did not tend to induce tnem to
spare horseflesh in their ride to the scene
of the fire. They expected each moment
to hear one of the fearful concussions the
secret of which old residents on this side
of the bay well know. They had gone
about half-way along the road and had
just rounded the turn when there was a
collision.
Their team and a hay wagon met end
on and Pollock and Garrity were thrown
to the ground and seriously injured. Gar
rity was rendered unconscious for a time,
and an examination later showed that he
haa a fractured collarbone and two broken
ribs, besides bruises innumerable. Super
intendent Pollock was aiso badly cut and
bruised, but not so seriously ai bis com
panion. The injured men were taken back
to Pinole ana attended to. The fire at the
powder works destroyed the loof of the
nitric acid uouse, but no further damage
was Cone,

JEFFKIES IS MUCH BETTER.
The Heavy-Weight Pugilist's Noble
Battle Against Pneumonia.
Jim Jeffries, the phenomenal heavy
weight from Los Angeles, who was to
meet Van Buskirk on the 25th inst, has
been quite ill with pneumonia for the past
three days. At one time he was so low it
was deemed advisable to telegraph his
family to come here and remain by what
was expected to be his deathbed.
Yesterday a change for the better took
place, and Dr. McCarthy, the attending
physician, pronounced his patient out of
danger, and his relatives will not be sum
moned here.
Jeffries was quite unfortunate and was
stricken down the very first day he began
training.
Btelzner, Fitzsimmons' sparring part
ner, has been substituted to go against
Van Buskirk. Fitz speaks highly of Stelz

sports think this will be a much warmer
contest than if Jeffries had stayed well.
Henry Peppers and Frank Purcell will
battle ten rounds the same night, This
also will be a good set-to, as Peppers is by
many considered the beÂ«t midcHe- weight
on the coast and Purcell is a "rusher."

Private Perry E. Hill, Company A, First
Infantry, was tried by a court-martial at
Angel Island, and upon a plea of guilty
found guilty of conduct to the prejudice
of good order and military discipline and
disobedience of orders in violation of the
Twenty-first Article of War and was sen
tenced "to forfeit to the United States $10
of his pay."
General Forsyth in reviewing the find
ings of the court-martial had this to say
in Special Orders No. 89:
Nothing appearing of record to explain why
â o light a sentence had been imposed for a con
fessed disobedience of orders manifested In
the presence of enlisted men and of the officer
giving said orders, the proceedings were re
turned and the court invited to reconsider Its
sentence. The court then placed upon record
Its belief that the accused had not a '-thorough
understanding of the con sequen ces of his plea, "
its doubt "whether or not he heard and under
stood the order" he disobeyed, and "considered
that the charge should properly have been laid
under the sixty-second Article of War."
The court adhered to its former sentence.
Whether or not the accused understood "the
consequences of his plea" is not known be
cause the court failed to question him on that
point. Whether the act of disobedience was
willful, and hence a plain violation of the
twenty-first Article of War, or the result of a
failure to hear and understand the order, and
in that case no offense whatever, cannot now
be known , for it appears the court
indulged enly in theories concerning the
significance of the prisoner's plea and the
degree oi his guilt instead of following its plain
path of duty, as marked out by precedents and
the uniform procedure of courts-martial, to
.call for witnesses and by the weight of their
"testimony solve the doubts that beset it.
It may be stated as a guiding rule that the
plea of an enlisted man should never be ac
cepted by a court-martial as final when such
an acceptance raises a grave doubt as to a mis
carriage of justice. In all such cases available
evidence should be obtained and considered.
The court having failed in this respect and
raised a doubt as to the justice of its own find-
Ing upon the second charge and its specifica
tion, the finding thereon la disapproved.

OUTING OF THE BAKERS.
A Pleasant Day in Social Reunion at
the Bay Side.
The Journeymen Bakers' and Confec
tioners' Union gave a picnic yesterday at
Germarria Gardens, Harbor View, and en
joyed the outing thoroughly. With their
wives and families and friends they made
a jolly party, that passed the time in vari
ous ways at tneir own sweet will, some
finding diversion in games, others taking
advantage of the fine afternoon to rest in
the open air, while most of those at the
picnic gathered in the dance pavilion.
Dancing was the main feature of the
oicnic, for there were no formal exercises.
It was not a day or a time for occupying
the mind with speeches and conventional
recitations, so the bakers thought, but one
exclusively devoted to social pleasure. 80
the bakers and their friends did nothing
but enjoy themselves all day long.
In the afternoon great sport was had in
games, which were composed of races for
young ladies, married women, men and
boys, and also several events for children.
Each event was warmly contested for
prizes.
0. Grassmann was chairman of the com
mittee of arrangements and also of the
games committee. W. Raake acted as floor
manager, and the reception of visitors as
well as all other matters was in the hands
of A. Eisolt, J. Muller, A. Jackofski, J.
Wieland, C. Blackman, W. Schneider, C.

CRICKET ACROSS THE GAY
The Pacific Club Defeats the
Californias by Many
Runs.
The Junior Members of Two Clubs
Contest a Game at tbe Golden
Gate Grounds.
There was only one cup cricket contest
played : yesterday. It was between ' the
Pacifies â  and Californias, was '- played at
Alameda and resulted in a victory for the
Pacifies by 47 runs. ;./
'â :â :â }. The Pacifies went in first and compiled
the very respectable total of 127. - ; Messrs. ;
Sewell, Pocock ; and â â _â  Harbour .'â '. were the
principal \ contributors to this total. It
must be noticed, however, that the team
was short two men, and that such mem
bers as John Theobald, Casidy and Tiede
mann were conspicuous by their absence.
The score, nevertheless, proved ade
quate, for the ; California's, in .spite of ex
cellent play on the part of Van â  Norden
and Shroder, failed to amass more than 80
runs. The fielding on both sides was good
and the match, one-sided though ,it was,
excited the interest of a goodly crowd of
spectators. Following are the full scores:

A MENANCE TO HEALTH.
Citizens Near Union and Leavenworth
Streets "Will Ask to Have m
Nusiance Abated.
The residents in the vicinity of Union
and Leavenworth streets are very much
annoyed at what they term a menace to
their health. A petition is being made
ready to be presented to the Board of
Health, asking that the nusiance be
abated.
The following document is being signed
by tbe property-owners and residents of
the section mentioned:
San Francisco, August 13. 1896.
To the Honorable Board of Health, San Fran
cisco â Gentlemen : Your attention is respect
fully called by the undersigned to the bad
condition of the sewerage at the corner of
Union and Leavenworth streets, which, if no:
attended to at once, will not only be detri
mental to property-owners, but will also be a
menace to the health of the residents in the
neighborhood.
Trusting that this will receive your im
mediate attention, we are yours, respectfully.
This will be presented at the next meet
ing of the board by a committee to be ap
pointed for that purpose.
The nusiance is a tank or cistern under
the street at Leavenworth and Union in
which water is said to be stored for use in
case of fire, for the pressue from the
hydrants at that elevation is not con
sidered sufficient to force the water into
the hose in case of need. Pressure is easily
had to supply all demands for the engine
at the power-house at the same elevation,
however, and the need of the cistern is not,
therefore, apparent.
PILGRIM SUNDAY-SCHOOL
Its Thirty-Third Anniversary at
the First Unitarian
Church.
Charles A. Murdock's Felicitous Ad.
dress to the Childrenâ Fioral
Tributes.
The thirty-third anniversary of the Pil
grim Sunday-school was celebrated yester
day morning in the First Unitarian
Church. Rev: William G. Eliott Jr., who
is the associate pastor with the Rev. Dr.
Stebbins, is soon to go East|and after next
Sunday will be seen no more in the church.
The children of the school, some 200
strong are specially well behaved, atten
tive and intelligent. During the exercises
the children repeated the following prayer :
Our heavenly Father, we thank thee for this
day and all its blessings; we thank thee for
our Sunday-school, for kind teachers and kind
friends. We pray that thy blessing may rest
upon our school in the years to come as in
years gone by. We, ourselves, would learn to
love and help our school more and more. May
thy spirit, O God, be ever present in our
hearts. May we hear the still, small voice
ever warning us against wrong-doing and urg
ing us to do well. We are children, O God â
we know very little of the great sorrows and
the groat joys of life; we know not what the
years may bring to us, but we pray that we
may so live now as to inherit the kingdom pre
pared for each one of us from the beginning of
the world, the kingdom of thy love. Amen.
After music and Scripture reading by
the Rev. Samuel Slocombe, tbe children
were addressed by Charles A. Murdock,
who has been a member of the churcn for
thirty-three years, and the superintend
ent of the Sunday-scbool for twenty-five
years.
He told the children reminiscences of
his own boyhood, when he used to go to
Sunday-school in â¢ New England town in
a one-horse shay and take his luncheon
with him, so far'was the distance from his
home to the church.
"The life of every child," he said, "may
be likened to a fertile garden, in which
may be grown either choice fruits and
flowers or worthless weeds. The purpose
of our school, children, is to aid you in
wisely cultivating this garden and keeping
it free from weeds, but withont your own
earnest co-operation it is not in the power
of anybody to make you grow up to be
good men and women."
Brief addresses were also made by Dr.
Stebbins and Superintendent Eliot. After
the benediction and before dispersing,
each and every boy and girl was presented
with a bunch of beautiful fragrant flowers.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
Real Estate Dealers Talk About
the Mortgage Tax
Law.
THEY FAVOR ITS KEPEAI.
Several Auction Sales to Be Held
This Weekâ Review of
the Records.
Tbe chief feature of the market the past
week was a notable increase in the inquiry for
small properties. This demand comei, bo
brokers say, mainly from people having a few
thousand dollars in the bank, and which they
seem to prefer to invest in real estate rather
than allow it to remain in the bank. One or two
of the savings banks have given notice to their
depositors that the six months' notice pro
vided for by law must be given the bank be
fore deposits can be withdrawn. This action
on the part of the banks has created some un
easiness among depositors and has prompted
the latter in a number of instances to seek de
sirable property in which to invest their
savings. .
The repeal of the mortgage tax law, to which
allusion was made last week, is generally
favored by real-estate men, as will be seen
from the following interviews:
A. S. Baldwin of the firm of Baldwin 4 Ham
mond, when asked for his opinion of the mat
ter, said :
I favor the reoeal of the law for the reason that
It would have a beneficial effect Â«pon the City and
state. It would bring outside capital here for in
vent ment in loans, something that It is quite im
possible to get under present conditions. I believe,
too, that it would materially reduce the rate of in
terest. As matters now stand, while the lender
nominally pays Hie tax, yet the rafc of interest is
always made high enough to more than cover the
tax and leave a net interest of good proportions.
The uncertainty as to what the tax rate is going
to be each year makes lenders ask a high enough
rate to insure themselves against loss, and, where
the taxes do not come up to the point estimated by
the lender, the borrower is a loser. It is a matter
of vast importance to the Stiite, and the subject
should be taken up by real estate men and an ef
fort made to show the people the advantages that
would accrue from a repeal of the law.
Spencer C. Buckbee of the firm of Bhainwald,
Buckbee & Co., said:
Yes. I favor the repeal of the mortgage tax law
for a number of reasons. Parties who have money
to loan on real estate seek stability of vaiue In the
security offered and stability in the rate of in
terest. Under our system of taxing mortgages it
is impossible to figure exactly what the net re
turns on a mortgage loan will be. No one can es
timate accurately what the tax rate will be from
year to year, and only local parties and institu
tions will make loans here and they do it because
they know the local conditions and can guess bet
ter what taxes are liable to be from one year to an
other.
The removal of the mortgaie tax wonld cause
large sums of Eastern and foreign capital to come
here for investment in loans. It wonid cause a
competition In the loan business that would reduce
interest rates. The borrower would thus be bene
fited. He pays the tax anyway indirectly, for the
interest rate is" always made high enough to include
the tax, and if the lender guesses too high in
regard to the tax rateâ and he will never guess too
lowâ the borrower is the loser.
Gustav H. TJmbsen of the firm of G. H. TJmb
sen & Co. expresses himself as follows:
Icertainy favor a repeal of the mortgage tax
law. for the reason that it will be the means of
bringing outside capital to -his Stateâ something
that we are mucli in need of for developing our
numerous resource*. As matters are at present it
is possible to obtain money for mortgage loans
only from people within our own state. The re
peal of the lam would, in my opinion, reduce the
rates of Interest, and in this as welt as many other
ways be of advantage to the borrower. The many
good reasons why the law should be repealed
should be so clear to any one who gives the matter
any consideration, that, little or no argument
should be required to induce a majority of voters
to vote for the repeal of the law at the coming
election.
Will Â£. Fisher of the nrm of WillE. Fisher A
Co. said :
I cannot express myself too emphatically in
favor of the repeal of the mortgage tax law. Its
existence has been a drawback to our State and
has retarded the growth and development of this
City. We have built ourselves up to the point we
are" at simply from our own resources and without
the aid. to any material extent, of outside capital.
We have reason to be proud of that we have ac
complished, to be sure, but think how much
greater would have been the progress of San Fran
cisco and California if we had during all these
years had tbe aid of outside capital in addition to
our own.
I know from my owu experience, gained while I
was East recently, that plenty of money could be
obtained there for loans on mortgages here at 3^
to 4 per cent, provided we did not hava a mort
gage-tax law. Borrowers in this City are paying
6 Vi t0 7 P er cent. The lender pays the tax which
did not until last year average much over iy a per
cent. Up in the cor.ntry farmers can seldom ob
tain loans except from local banks, to whom they
are obliged to pay 9, JO and as hich as 12 percent.
The tax on the mortgage which the lender pays
amounts to but litt eco pared with what we pay
.. here in the City. If it was not for tbe barrier of
the mortgage-tax law farmers could obtain money
for almost half what they have to nay for it ut
present. If California warns to make more rapid
progress than she has made up to date, outside
capital must be had, and it can only be obtained
on loans by the repeal of the mortgage-tax law.
Charles Spader, of the firm of Center <fe
Spader, had the following to say:
The mortgage tax law should, in my opinion, be
repealed, and until it is we need not hope to ob
tain money from outside the State to loan on real
estate. Eastern capitalists who have money to
loan are almost always willing to accept a low
rate of interest on good loans, but they want to
know what their money is going to net them, and
they will not put it ont with the attending un
certainty that exists here as to what rate a loan
will ne after the payment of the mortgage tax. I
think borrowers would be benefited, tor It would
in the end reduce the rate of interest, particularly
on country loans,
A. M. Speck of the firm of A. M. Speck & Co.
said:
I have not given the matter extended considera
tion, but so far as I have investigated I believe the
repeal of the mortgage-tax law would prove of
rr.-at benefit to the City ana Stale. It would
cause outside capital to come in, and there Is com
petition even In money lending, such competition
bring naturally beneficial to borrowers, for it en
ables them in many instances to obtain money at
lower rates than they could otherwise.
Iv an interview with H. D. Laurie and A. J.
Carmany the managers of the California
Title Insurance and Trust Company, tney both
expressed themselves as decidedly in favor of
the repeal of the mortgage-tax law.
I'hey stated that they knew from their own ex
perience that it was impossible to obtain outside
capital to loan on mortgages in this State so long
as the mortgage-tax law is in existence. They
said that the need of outside capital to aid in the
development of tue State was generally conceded,
and the mortgage-tax law is a ba.rier that wiil per
petually exclude capital from the State so long as
said law remains in force.
Mr. Harding, tbe attorney for this company, said
that he went East about two years ago for the
express purpose of trying to induce large financial
institutions to place capita l at the disposal of their
company for loaning on real estate in th;s state.
He fcund nearly all those he interviewed quite
willing to enter into arrangements witn him, and
found that they were witling to effect loans at 3 1 , a
to 4 1 ." per cent, but as soon as he informed them
of the provisions of the mortgage tax law, nego
tiations were brought abruptly to a close, and he
was unable to fin l one individual or concern
willing to invest a single dollar in California in the
shape of mortgage loans under existing conditions.

son the firm has had, and that, too, in spite of
the hard times. : He attributes it to two rea
sonsâin the first place, because Alameaa is a
favored locality for homes; and, secondly, be
cause the tighter the money market the sooner
do people of . moderate means endeavor to get
their own. home, when abie to but the same, as

members.
Granuaile had the stake well in hand,
the bitch running as she never did before,
until an unfortunate fall in her course
with Flying Buck broke one of her legs
and threw her out. The fancy picked
Skyball as a winner and made bim a b g

POOR MAY SPEAK
UNDER THE SKY,
There Is No Law to Muzzle
Men's Tongues and
Pens.
POLICE DO NOT ARREST.
A Truce Declared Until the
Socialist Labor Cases Are
Decided.
EX-JUDGE MAGUIBE'S VIEWS-
He Says There Is No Law Silencing
Those Who Are Unable to
Hire Halls.
The police did not interfere with the
speakers of the Socialist-Labor party who
spoke on the street at Seventh and Mar
ket streets at 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon, having been instructed by the Chief
The Police Did Not Interfere With the Socialists' Open-Air Meeting Yesterday
at the Corner of >arkec and Seventh Streets. Tbe Arrested Socialists
Will Be Tried To-Day,
not to make any arrests unless there were
marked disturbances of the peace or some
violent demonstrations.
Long before 2 o'clock the streets were
crowded, and promptly at 2, Theodore
Lynch of the Socialist Labor party
mounted the rostrum and began his
speech. Many of those assembled had
come out of curiosity, and when they saw
that there would be no arresta, they de
parted.
The speeches were of the usual type of
the Socialist Labor party denunciations of
the existing order of things, but as the
police had no instructions to interfere by
reason of what was said slighter interest
attached to the substance of the orations.
Following Lynch George Speed, who is
well known in the order, said:
"We believe in the Declaiation of Inde
pendence and in liberty. We think we
have a right to assemble here and peace
ably discuss any questions we see tit to
discuss. vVe are worse off here than they
are in Europe, considering the inequalities
of the countries compared."
Such was the line of discussion, but the
great crowd wan interested more in the
outcome of the contest between the police
and the speakers.
Meantime the policemen were as harm
less as lion cubs without teeth, for they
stood about with arms akimbo, acting as
ushers to see that auditors had good

positions and that women mieht pass from
place to place undisturbed.
Speed was cheered when he said: "The
wage-worker is only a commodity, but we
think we still have a right to express our
sentiments, even if we are not rich enough
to hire a ball."
It was plain to be seen that the mass of
the people in the crowd, men and women
of all sorts and conditions, were in favor
of the position taken by the speakers and
opposed to the censorship of the police.
There were frequent expressions to the
effect that the police had no right to judge
as to violations of the law against speak
ins: on the streets, thereby becoming ob
noxious censors.
Congressman James G. Maguire, presi
dent of the Free Press Defense Associa
tion, an organization intended to defy the
Sacramento Judge's narrow interpretation
of the Barry contempt law, was seen on
the subject of the recent arrests at a late
hour last night. Speaking of the question,
he said:
"It is beyond all question the right of
the people peaceably to assemble in any
convenient place for the discussion of
public questions, and it does not matter
whether the speakers be socialists, Demo
crats, Republicans or religious brothers.
Under all circumstances they should be
accorded equal rights.
"There should be convenient and cen
tral public places in every city set apart
for such speeches. Those who speak must
not disturb others. The right of free
speech means more than the right of those
who have money to hire a hall. It neces
sarily includes the right to speak and to
hear in central and convenient places,
where the moneyless may hear and be
beard.
"It would not be liberty if none might
speak save those able to hire halls. Such
a law would be in favor of the well-to-do
class and therefore un-American in the
extreme."
Nothing further will be done by the po
lice until the termination of the cases now
pending.
CARTRIDGE OVERLOOKED
A Stray Ballet Bans Amuck in Isaac
Goodman's Pawnshop.
Isaac Goodman is the proprietor of a
pawnshop at 629 Washington street, and
in his work of relieving temporary dis
tress for gilt-edged collateral he is assisted
by his 16-year-old daughter, Mary.
Yesterday afternoon James G. Gumper,
a fireman in the employ of the Southern
Pacific, entered Goodman's shop with a
view to exchanging a 48-caliber revolver
for one of less formidable bore. Isaac
took the pistol for examination, and, fol
lowing a time-honored precedent, removed
all the cartridges but one. That one he
overlooked.
Gum per and Goodman were unable to
agree on terms of exchange, and the pawn
broker handed the weapon back :to its
owner. Then the trouble commenced.
The pistol was provided with a hair
trigger, and in the exchange it was dis
charged, the ball grazing Mary Goodman's
neck. Then it struck the wall and came
bounding back and struck Isaac in the
right eye. Its force was about spent,
however, and it only caused nn abrasion.
The pawnbroker, startled by the report
and still more by the smart of the bullet,
dropped the revolver and it went crashing
through his showcase. The girl was un
hurt, but all three parties were badly
frightened. And Isaac Goodman lost &
showcase. :;â¢ .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 1896.
FIRST STOLE, THEN
TRIED TO MURDER,
Exciting Scene in a How
ard-Street Lodging-
House.
E. P. CASHIN THE VICTIM
Awakened From His Sleep He
Found Two Strange Men in
His Room.
ONE OF TEEM DOUBLY ARMED.
Casbim Showed Fight, Pursued the
Robbers and Was Shot in the
Left Leg.
A robbery and attempted murder were
committed in the Oakland House, 664}Â£
Howard street, yesterday morning, the
victim being E. P. Cashin, who has been
rooming at the Winchester House on
Third street for a few days and is said to
be a lighthouse-keeper.
Cashin made the acquaintance of Maggie
O'Day, a wayward girl, 17 years of age, in
a dive on Grant avenue early yesterday
morning. They had some drinKs and
together went to the Oakland about 5
o'clock, where Cashin engaged a room.
About 9 o'clock two men forced their
way Into Cashin's room. The girl was
awake, and one of them, who had a re
volver in each hand, cautioned her not to
make a noise on pain of having her brains
blown out. He kept the frightened girl
covered with his revolvers while the other
man went through the pockets of Cashin's
clothing and took $56 and his gold watch.
The noise awakened Cashin, and, divin
ing that he was the victim of robbers, he
sprang out of bed. The man with the re
volvers, who had his back to the door,
warned him not to coma near him or he
would shoot, but Casbin unheeded the
warning and dealt the robber a blow on
the neck with his clinched list.
The two robbers ran out of the room
pursued by Cashin. There was a scuffle
on top of the landing and the robbers ran
downstairs and onto the street, hotly pur
sued by Cashin, who only wore his
trousers. They went in different direc
tions, and Cashin followed the man with
the revolvers up Third and into Minna
street. Here the robber wheeled round
and fired a shot at Cashin, the bullet
entering the fleshy part of his left leg
below tbe knee.
Casbin dropped to the ground and the
robber continued his flight. The shot at
tracted the attention of John Smith, who
keeps a lodging-house at 111^ Minna
street. He ran in the direction ot the shot
and saw the robber fleeing along the street.
Smith yelled to him to drop the revolvers,
when he wheeled round and threatened
to blow Smith's brains out if he persisted
in following him.
Smith was not to be intimidated, but fol
lowed the robber, blowing his police
whistle all the time. On Second street,
near Mission, Smith saw the robber throw
the two revolvers under the sidewalk, and
he picked them up.
The blowing of Smith's whistle attracted
the attention of Michael Sallozoe, 156
Third street, an ex-special officer, and he
captured the robber on Ecker street. He
was taking him to the Southern police
station when he met Policeman D. R.
Campbell, and Campbell 100k charge of
the prisoner.
The robber was recognized as John
Kelly, an ex-convict, and he was booked
on tbe charge of assault to commit murder.
Casbin was led back to his room and
then he discovered that he had been
robbed. The patrol wagon was sum
moned and he was taken to tbe Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Renne dressed his
wound and he went home. Cashin tried
to hide his identity by giving his name as
Jack Wilson and his residence as 1133 Mis
sion street, and told a milk and water
story of how he got wounded, declaring
that he would not prosecute the man.
Detective T. L. Ryan and Policeman
Tyrrel were detailed on the case, and on
learning that Cashin had been robbed
they placed an additional charge of rob
bery against Kelly.
Ryan took the O'Dav girl to the Central
Police station, where she was searched to
see if any of the stolen money was in her
possession, but none was found. She de
clared that she did not know either of tha
two robbers and had never seen them be
fore. She was booked on the charge of
vagrancy. The girl's father died a few
years ago in South San Francisco, leaving
an estate worth several thousand dollars.
The girl took to drink and was said to be
tbe associate of Arthur Jackson, tbe
young man charged with the murder of
August Florentine last Monday morning.
Ryan and Tyrrel are confident they will
soon have Kelly's companion behind the
bars.
SAILOR AND AVOREES.
A Party of Christian Young People Visit
the U. S. Steamer Bennington.
The sailors of the United States steamer
Beunington had a surprise given them
last Saturday night. They did not know
that the Christian Endeavorers had
planned to visit them, and when the Ethel
and Marion, as the tug which the Endeav
orers go out on is named, came alongside
and landed a goodly number of young
men and ladies on board the warship the
sailors were surprised. But Jack is not
bashful, and soon the expressions of sur
prise were exchanged for words of wel
[ come to the young people who had braved
the fog and wind to bring to them words
of cheer and comfort.
After a few personal words and hand
shakes with the sailors the Endeavorers
'and man-o'- wars- men joined in a short
song service led by George Duncan Jr.
Henry Eden, the chairman of the float
ing committee; George Duncan Jr. and
Charles Woodman each made short ad
dresses. Before the young people had left
the sailors gave them a cordial invitation
to visit them again, and several professed
their willingness to join the society should
one be formed on board.
Last week a society was formed on board
the United States steamer Oregon and
twenty-two sailors signed the Christian
Endeavor pledge.
Among those who visited the Benning
ton were Henry F. Eden, Professor J. A.
Wiles, Lizzie Hofmann, Miss Botsford, E.
E. Painter, Miss L. Painter, George Dun
can Jr., Robert Cleland, Miss P. Painter,
Miss W. Martin, Mr. and Mrs. Clark, L. J.
Harrison, H. Crossman, Miss Thompson,
Charles Woodman, Miss Johnson, Miss J.
Barrows. Miss Hamilton, J. F. Mason,
Miss Hudson, Mrs. Hoilowell, Lloyd

A. E. BUCKMAN SCORED.
Hospital Lot Improvement Club Passes
Resolutions Condemning Hia
Labor Camp.
A very enthusiastic meeting of the Hos
pital Lot TraDrovement Club was held at
the hall Saturday evening. Over 200 new
members were added, and Frank Bragg,
chairman of the committee on enrollment,
reported that at least 600 members would
sign the roll before the next meeting of
the club.
While the report of Attorney W. M.
Abbott was encouraging, yet the state
ment was made, as contained in The Call
of the 14th inst., that Contractor A. E.
Buckman had defied the Health Officer,
and would refuse to remove the obnoxious
camp. This statement so aroused the
meeting that the following resolution was
unanimously adopted and a copy ordered
sent to The Call for publication and also
to Dr. Lovelace, Health Officer:
Whereas, We learn tnrough the public press
that A. E. Buckman, owner of the nuisance
known as "Buckman's camp," bids defiance to
the laws and law officer of the Board of Healtn
of this City ; and whereas, this club has been
organized in the interest ot the health of our
families and to protect our homes and our
property; therefore,

Victoria regia in bloom
One of the Latest Attractions
in Golden Gate
Park.
What Improvements Are Going on in
the People's P easure-Groundâ Down
by the Ocean Beach,
The attraction in Golden Gate Park at
this time is the monster water flower, the
Victoria Regia, which is in the lily pond
in the conservatory, which bloomed last
week and will, so says Head Gardener
Holbrow, bloom again to-day, when it will
be white, to-morrow, when it will be pink,
and on Wednesday, when it will be pur
ple, and on the evening of that day its
glory will terminate. The flower, when
fully opened, is several feet in width. The
leaves of this particular plant are eight in
number, five feet in diameter, with the
edges turned up, green on the surface and
purple underneath. If a plank be laid on
one of the leaves it will hold up a two.
year-old child of ordinary size.
A flock of more than forty ducks came
from the south yesterday and hovered
over Stow Lake. They made two or three
attempts to settle in the lake, but were de
terred from doing so by the number of
people who were boating. They then
went north and rested in Austin Lake,
north of the speed track. "That's a sign
of an early winter," said Boatkeeper Ohni-

mus. There were quite a number of peo
ple in boats on the lake in the afternoon.
This part of the park is having an un
usual number of visitors of late, and de
servedly so, as it a picturesque and very
attractive one.
The following contributions have been
made to the Pane Museum during the
week: Mrs. J. 8. Henshaw, specimens of
rare coral from the Samoan Islands; Er
nest H. Short of Albion, N. V., specimens
of marble and onyx from Yavapai County,
Ariz. ; John L. Bardwell, bronze Presi
dential medals, assignats or bills issued in
France in 1792, and several very pretty
sp cimens from Japan, Corea and other
places.
There were many people by the sea
shore, and there were not a few who took
advantage of the smoothness of the water
to allow their children to wade in. One of
the young girls who divested herself of a
pair of new shoes and good stockings was
sorely troubled when she returned to the
rocks where she deposited tbem and dis
covered that some one had stolen them.
There were many at Sutro Heignts and
a big crowd in the Sutro baths to witness
the performance given by the members of
the California Bwimming Club. In the
fifty-yard race for boys S. Coggius won the
first prize and C. Collins the second. In
the 100-yard race, open, D. A. Barrows was
the winner and J. Ringrose second.

TROUBLE IN A
LODGE OF ELKS,
The Members of Golden
Gate No. 6 Suspended
for Insubordination.
TWO FACTIONS FORMED.
Blackballs for Candidates Who
Were Not Agreeable to
Either Side.
LOOKING FOB A CAUSE.
Grand Exalted Ruler Meade D. Dei
weiler Comes From Pittsburg to
Investigate the Case.
There has been trouble in Golden Gate
Lodge No. 6 of the Benevolent Protective
Order of Elks, and that trouble led to its
suspension about two months ago by the
then grand exalted ruler, William G.
Meyers.
What the particular trouble was that led
to the suspension is a matter that is
known only to the members of the lodge
and they hold it as a lodge secret, but suf
ficient has been learned to know that it
was caused by a desire on the part of one
faction to keep out candidates who were
favored by another faction, and this fac
tion retaliated when friends of the first
were presented for election.
The result was that all who came up for
Meade D. Detweiler. G. E. R.
admission into the lodge who were of one
side or the other were blackballed.
This state of affairs reached the grand
exalted ruler, w o at once sent notice
that such actions must cease as the mat
ters which caused the two factions were
such as bad no business in the lodgeroom,
as outside controversies should not be
brought within the order. There was no
notice paid to the words of the grana offi
cers, and as fair warning had been given
he concluded that the members were in
subordinate and suspended tbe lodge.
When the Grand Lodge met in Cincin
nati last July, the case of Golden Gate
Lodge came before it, and that body so
thoroughly indorsed the suspension that
it continued it until the new grand
exalted ruler should see fit to reopen it.
The statements of Past Exalted Ruler
Henry H. Davis and District Deputy
Ernest Ullman. supported by the testimony
of Past Exalted Rulers Perner and Har
ney, went to show that the powers of the
urand Lodge had been dehed, and that
the district deputy had been grossly in
sulted.
An attempt was made to show that the
trouble in the lodge grew out of the giving
of carnival balls by the lodge, but this evi
dently did not have an effect on the grand
body in view of the action taken.
Mead' D. Detweiler of Hamburg, Pa.,
who was elected by the Grand Lodge to
the office of exalted ruler, left his home a
few days ago to come to this City to per
sonally investigate the causes that led to
the forming of factions within the lodge
and if possible bring about a state of broth
erly love which should exist in every fra
ternal benevolent organization.
If he fails in this he will take away the
lodge charter, and a once flourishing lodge
which had nearly 200 members will be
wiped out of existence.
Mr. Detweiler arrived in this City yes
terday and is stopping at the Palace.
During the day be called upon promi
nent members of the lodge to advise him
self as to the trouble, in order that he may
discover bow to brine about a reconcilia
tion, but what conclusions be reached or
what he will do to effect harmony and
restore peace he declined to say.
The new grand exalted ruler, who is but
33 years of age, is probably the youngest
man who has ever heid this responsible
position. He is a descendant of a Penn
sylvanian German family and for twenty
two years has been a resident of Pittsburg,
where he is engaged in tbe practice of law.
He was elected District Attorney of
Dauphin County in 1892, was re-elected in
1895, receiving more majority than his
opponent received votes. He has been
connected witii the elks for many years
and has held a number of nigh positions
in the order.
The lodge he has come to look after is
one of the oldest in the order, and previ
ous to this trouble stood high lor the good
work it did in rendering aid to those who
needed it. It is the consolidation of two
lodges that at one time existed in this
Cityâ Golden Gate No. 6 and Excelsior
No." 12. Most of its members are of the
stage, although persons of other profes
sions are eligible as members.
Christ's Second Coming.
Elder Henry 8. Tanner, president of the Cali
fornia Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints, discoursed in Pythian Cas
tle last night upon "The Second Coming of
Christ." He said: "Ancient and modern
prophecy are one in portraying to our intelli
gence the coming of Christ in the near future,
but the day and hour no man knows. How
ever, the present conditions indicate hi* cear
approach, but Zion must be built and Jerusa
lem rebuilt before the appointed time of his ap
pearance. The scripture is replete with pas
sages showing the condition of the world at
Christ's coming, and in most instances we see
fulfilled the predictions. The Redeemer will
come to Ziou and unto them tnat turn from
transgression in Jacob.
"We are told that Christ's appearance will
be sudden and the time will be cut short, but
the appointed works must be accomplished
and the scripture fulfilled. The gospel must
be preached in all the world. When the ieo
ple see these things they know that his coming
is near. We see the predicted condition of the
nations and the waywardness of the people,
and it only rests with the Lord to hasten his
work and usher in the reign of righteousness.
Not a Friend.
Arthur Porter was mentioned the other day
as an acquaintance of Winthrop. This state
ment he wishes corrected. He is no acquaint
ance of Winthrop, he says, and he does not
wish to be known es one.

WENT UP IN A BLAZE
Emil Markeburg's Thrilling As
cension From the Haight-
Street Grounds.
He Rose Five Hundred Feet Before
He Saw the Balloon Was
on Fire.
Bmil Markeburg, the aeronaut, was at
the Haight-street grounds yesterday, and
in the presence of the largest crowd that
has assembled there since the reopening,
he was introduced by a crier, who an
nounced that after Conn Fredericks, the
demon cyclist, bad coasted down the
chutes on his bicycle, Professor Marke
burg would make a thrilling balloon
ascension, the first since he met with an
accident by which his hipbone was put
out of place.
The little aeronant did not at that time
think the ascent he was to make would be
bo thrilling as it really turned out to be.
The sphere was well inflated, and when
everything was ready to let go, Markeburg
ran to his place at the trapeze at the end
of the parachute, which lay stretched on
the south side of the balloon. As the word
was given every one released his hold and
the balloon commenced to rise, but before
it was ten feet from the ground, it was dis
covered that it was on fire near the bot
tom, on the side opposite to the aeronaut.
Some one who saw the blaze called to
MarkeDurg, who was still on the ground,
"She's going," ana supposing that the
speaker meant that the inflammable
sphere was ascending, answered, "Let her
bo " A half minute after that the balloon
had risen a hundred feet, and Markeburg
was in the air performing on the trapeze
unaware that th- balloon was on fire. As
the bag continued to rise the flame in
creased, and by the time it had reached an
altitude of 3CO feet the hole in the side was
at least ten feet long by five wide and the
flames were crawling upward rapidly.
Many on the grounds by this time real
ized the danger of the acrobatic aeronaut
and a cry of horror went up irom a large
number of throats. By this time Marke
burg, who had been hanging by his hands,
started to make a backward turn, and as
he did so he for the first time saw the blaze
above. The balloon was 500 fe t over the
center of Haight street and Markeburg
pulled on the cutaway Knife and the bal
loon and parachute parted company. The
parachute partly opened and in coming
down struck the telegraph wires on the
north side of the street near Masonic ave
nue and became entangled in them. The
balloonist then came dotfrn, but in doing
so strained his hip, which was recently
dislocated.
The balloon in the meantime collapsed
and fell in a vacant lot, setting fire to the
dry grass. Just at that time an engine
company was exercising, and being in the
vicinity stre:ched a line of ho<je and ex
tinguished the burning grass, but the line
was not long enough to reach the burning
balloon, so an ex-fireman suggested that
the burning balloon be dragged to the
stream, which was done, probably the
first time that a fire was taken to the
means of extinguishing it.
When Markeburg returned to the ground
with the wreck of his bailoon a gentleman
who felt for the loss he had sustained
stepped up to him and without uttering a
word pressed a sum of money into his
hand.
