COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 15.â The people
of Ohio opened the Presidential campaign
of their fellow citizen, William McKinley,
at CoJumbus to-day, with much enthu
siasm and no small degree of ceremony,
considering tne temperature. Ten thou
sand voters came from the cities, towns

thought to be the first important meeting
of tbe campaign. The visitors, the clubs

THE YACHT FAWN WON.
How the Gallant Encinal Boat Successfully Sailed the Great
Race, Beating the Speedy Catherine and Rejoicing
the Alamedans*
Yesterday afternoon the Encinals' pen
nant, with its single blue star, flew in
triumph over th<* bay when the gallant
little sloop Fawn plunged to the finish,
winning the Perpetual Challenge Gup and
the race of '96.
It was a great contest and all Alamedaâ
conservative Alameda, which affects
cricket, tennis and salt-water baths â
came down on the narrow-gauge mole to
see their club yacht defend tbe prize,
which was first brought home by the El
Sueno last year. They were hopeful
when the graceful craft bounded across
the line like the fleet animal of her name,
sure of victory when she flew like a white
cloud down the triangle course, and they
howled in the maddest, merriest manner
when the cup-defender came home 6
minutes and 19 seconds ahead of her rival.
The sloop Catherine, by which the San
Francisco Club expected to pull in the
prize and the race, worked well in
first stretch, but failed at the Blossom
Rock stake, and never made up for the
error. On the other hand, the Fawn's work
was faultless and she sailed on, putting
the water and the minutes between herself
and the other yacht from stake to stake.
The Fawn being 26.72 feet in length to
the Catherine's 25.90 the latter boat was
given a time allowance of 1 minute 36 sec
onds, and as the San Franciscan started 4
minutes 26 seconds behind her competitor
she baa a total allowance in her favor for
the race of 6 minutes 2 seconds. The
course was from the narrow-gauge mole to
Blossom Rock stakeboat, thence south
past a stake off Mission Rock to a third
stakeDoat off Hunters Point back to the
Mission Rock s take and across the bay to
the starting point.
The Fawn was sailed by Captain James
T. Rosseter, Edward Holmes, George
Dillman, J. A. Landsberger and L. Ward. ,
wrote Chairman Curtz, of the Republican
State Central Committee, that he does not
think it wise to depart from his determi
nation to make no political speeches out
side of Canton. Major McKinley thought
too, that the trio of distinguished speakers
secured for the occasion needed no rein
forcement. It seemed fitting to him that
in a campaign in which money is an issue
of vast importance, that two men who
have made financial speeches a specialty,
should be asked to open tbe discussion,
and that so brilliant a speaker on all Re
publican issues as Foraker should co
operate with them. The selection of Sher
man and Woodford at this time to discuss
the currency means that the Republicans
have determined to open up a heavy fire
all along the line of the advocates of free
silver.
It was almost 2:30 when Messrs. Sher
man, Foraker, Woodford and Bushnell
drove up to the big tent on Broad street,
where more than 10,000 people were as
sembled. The tent was brightly decorated.
\Vn--n the speakers entered there was loud
cheering.
Governor Bushnell presided at the meet
ing and after some pleasant words of wel
come, introduced Senator Sherman. The
greeting which the Senator received was
most cordial, and when a moment later he
On board the Catherine were Captain W.
L. Sutherland, A. Sutherland. Peter
Church, Dr. Hill, G. Meniffee and Harry
Doe. The racing committees vrhich fol
lowed the yachts aboard of the tug Sea
Queen were Commodore J. W. Pew,
referee; C. B. Hill of the San Francisco
and C. L. Tisdale of the Encinals, timers.
Commodore C. C. Bruce of the California
Yacht Club sailed on the Fawn as the
representative of the San Francisco club,
and Henry Landsberger on the Catherine
in a like capacity for the Encinals. A
large number of yachts and launches of
all colors followed the two fleet spoon
hulls.
The Fawn took the middle-bay course
toward Blossom Rock, while her rival
sought the slack water under the western
shore of G at Island.
The idea was to escape the strong, in
flowing tide and the maneuver was an
excellent one. However, she Jost a few
seconds by being obliged to tack twice
away from the island, but her crowning
misfortune occurred as she neared the
stakeboat. She was drawing toward the
turn when up went the gafftopsail. It
flapped and wrinkled like a flag and
fira/ged the ''loop to leeward like a tow
line.
Sutherland tried to hold her up to her
work, but it was no use, and the flatter
ing thing aioft killed her. In the mean
time the Fawn came up and rounded the
stake nicely and squared away before the
twenty-h've-mile breeze with mainsail,
gafftopsail jib and balloon jib swelling
outward in hard, beautiful curves of
canvas.
The Catherine held on to her worse than
useless gafftopsail, and finally worked far
enough to the northward of the stake
boat for a turn, and came about. Tbe
effort resulted in another failure, for that
everlasting sail kept on its wrinkling and
the vessel dragged to leeward of the stake.
commenced 'his speech with a eulogy of
Major McKinley, the audience cheered
lustily. His speech, and all the others as
well, commanded the closest attention of
the audience. The feeling among Repub
licans to-night is that the first great and
effective battery has been opened upoa
the enemy's lines, and the chairman of the
committee stÂ»ys to-day's meeting iÂ« to be
followed up by county meetings all over
trie State and that in twenty days there
will be a decided anu palpable change in
the uttiturt' ;' silver men in this
State; thea th * of their propa
ganda will be decisively checked.
Senator Sherman occupied about forty
five minutes in reading his speech. He
said:
Mr. Chairman and Fellow-Citizens: A citi
zen of Ohio has been selected by the Republi
can National Convention as the candidate for
President of the United States, and we are
here to ratify and support his nomination. I
We take pride in William McKinley, not only
for the honor conferred upon Ohio by the con
vention, but because we know him to be fitted
for that great office. We know that since his
boyhood his life has been pure and stainless,
that as a soldier in the Union army he was
brave ami loyal; that as a member of Congress
for many years he exhibited tje highest men
tal traits and rendered great services to his
country, and that as Governor of Ohio he
proved his capacity to perform difficult execu
Another tack and another attempt
got her around the turn, and she started
toward the south, with the Fawn showing
her fleet heels far down the stretch, and
7 minutes 3 seconds ahead.
Both vessels flew all their light sails, ex
cept spinnaker, making a beautiful run
along the water front, and the other
yachts crowding around. The big Emer
ald, loaded with Alamedans, tore along
after the Fawn, her people hooting loudly
for their cup-defender every fathom she
sailed.
The Fawn turned the Hunters Point
stake 9 minutes 32 seconds ahead, show
ing that the Catherine had lost 2 minutes
and 29 seconds ruuuing almost dead be
fore the wind.
The Encinai snatched in her balloon as
she whirled in the turn and started back
to Mission Rock under mainsail, jib and
gafftopsail close hauled. It was thought
that the Catherine would make up her
lost time on the wind and possibly bring
the cup from over the bay. The Fawn
failed to make the Mission stake, though
stie lay close to the wind, and had to make
a short lug to windward. She then paid
off so near the stakeboat's bowsprit that
the Encinal sympathizers aboard the fol
lowiner craft held their breaths.
To touch the stake would have lost, but
Captain Rossi ter hauled in his main boom
to clear the other vessel, and then, as he
filled away for the home-run, spread his
spinnaker. It wns a handsome spectacle,
the dainty sloop going free with her white
billows of cloth wing and wing, her clean
heels aspring over the bay.
Tlie Catherine also crowded on her sail,
but she could not catch the Encinal de
fender with the appropriate name. Be
tween Hur.ters Point stake and home she
lost 2 minutes 49 seconds more, and when
she crossed the line she lost the
Perpetual Challenge Cup by 6 minutes
and 19 seconds, corrected time.
tive duties. And he had the higher claim
upon us that during all his active life he has
been a faithful and able Republican, thor
oughly in sympathy with the principles of the
Republican party. That party, however, does
not rest its claims to your confidence merely
upon the merits of its candidates, but upon
the roundness of its public policy, its meas
ures and its alms.
It so happens that during the coming Presi
dential election there will be submitted to
your judgment two questions. Both silver
and tariff are vital questions of domestic
policy of equal importance, but I propose on
Ihis occasion to confine my remarks mainly to
what is known as the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 parts of silver to 1 of gold.
Gold and silver coins are recognized by nil
commercial nations of the world as the best
standards of value as the measure of every
article of desire, of everything that is bought
or sold. These two measures not only measure
all other things, but they measure each other.
Their relative value constantly changes.
Twenty-three yearsago sixteen ounces of silver
were worth more than one ounce of gold. Now
thirty-one ounces of silver can be bought by
one ounce of gold. This fluctuation of value
cannot be prevented by law. It is beyond the
reach of legislation. It is caused by the
changed demand for and the increasing supply
of these metals from the mines.
In 1792 silver and gold were made the com
mon standards of value in the United States
at the ratio of 15 to 1, but this was because
the actual market value of fifteen ounces of
silver was equal to the actual market value of
one ounce of gold. At that time neither gold
nor silver was found in any considerable
quantity in the thirteen States then forming
the Union. When the new American coins
were issued it was found ttiat the abrased or
worn coins of other countries filled the chan
nels of circulation and the new and bright
dollars of the United States were exported.
This led to the discontinuance in 1306, by
President Jefferson, of the coinage of the silver
dollar, and after that date none were coined
for more than thirty years. This order of
Jefferson. I suppose, would be called by our
Populistic friends "the crime of 1806." In
the meantime France ana other countries
adopted the ratio of fifteen and a half ounces
of silver as the equivalent of one ounce of
gold. To avoid this embarrassing change
England, in 1816, adopted gold as the single
standard in that country and silver as sub
sidiary- coin.
In 1834, during the administration of Presi
dent Jackson and under the leadership of
Daniel Webster and Thomas H. Beuton, Con
gress adopted the ratio of 16 ounces of silver
to 1 of gold by reducing the number of grains
in the gold coin. As silver was thus slightly
undervalued it was not largely coined. Silver

The Whole Vile Story of H. F. Marshall's Dastardly
Attempt at Extortion Now Made
Public by the Man Who Was
Selected as the Victim.
The law firm of Del mas & Shortridge yesterday tiled the answer of John D,
Bpreckela in the suit of Marshall against Spreckels. Marshall sued Mr. Spreckela
for $50,000 damages for hitting him in the mouth with his fist and knocking his front
teeth down his throat.
Mr. Spreckels was asked last night by a reporter as to the facts of the case. He
said he had nothing to add to the matter contained in his answer filed in the court.
Whatever ne had done had been done in reply to an attempt to blackmail him, and
he had resented it as any other honest man would have done.
"When this charge against me came up several months ago I denounced it as
absolutely false. It was simply a tissue of lies. When I was attending the National
Republican Convention in St. Louis my attention was called to the suit by the
editor of the Bacramento Bee, and I denounced the whole story as untrue. My
statement wa-Â» given publicity throupn the columns of the Bee, and everybody who
read it understood the animus of the matter."
In the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the City and Connty ol
San Francisco.
H. F. Marshall, plaintiff, vs. John D. Spreckels. defendant. No. 55,601. Answer.
Comes now the above-named defendant, and answering to the complaint of the
above-named plaintiff,
Said defendant denies that on the 14th day of April, 1896, at the City an.d County
of San Francisco, or at any other lime or place, he, with great or any, force and vio
lence, or ai all assaulted and attacked, or assaulted or attacked the plaintiff.
Saia detendant avers that at said time and place he had reason to believe, and did
in fact believe, the plaintiff had the intent to commit a public offence and felony; that
plaintiff did then and there attempt to commit a felony, and that he assaulted
defendant.
Said defendant admits that, thereupon, he struck the plaintiff, and avers that he
used only neessary force to protect and defend himself from wrongful injury then,
impending anil threatened by the plaintiff.
Said defendant denies that he violently and brutally struck the plaintiff, or that
he brutally struck the plaintiff, or that he struck him any more violently, or witn any
greater force than was necessary to resist the plaintiff's then present attempt to com*
mit a public offence and a felony.
As to the allegations in the said complaint to the effectthat the defendant beat the
plaintiff, breaking his teeth and cutting the skin of his face, the defendant has no in
formation or belief upon the subject sufficient to enable him to answer thereto, and
placing his denial upon that ground, denies that plaintiff's teeth were broken or that
the skin of his face or any other portion of his body was cut by defendant.
Said defendant denies that he did kick plaintiff with great or any force in tha
back or in any other part or parts of the body, or at all.
11.
Said defendant denies that he attacked plaintiff, and denies that his striking plain*
could be coined In France at the ratio of \b\4
to 1, and the owner of silver bullion could
send It to France and have it converted into
coin at that ratio, thus receiving about 3 per
rent more for his bullion than if coined at the
American ratio of 16 to 1. Gold became the
only American coin in circulation, and the
avowed purpose of the passage of the law of
1834 was to make gold the standard. This
â¢ was declared by the committee of the House of
Representatives who had charge of the bill,
who said in their report:
"The committee thinks that the desideratum
in the monetary system is a standard of uni
form value. It cannot ascertain that both
metals have ever circulated simultaneously,
concurrently and indiscriminately In any
country where there are banks or money
dealers, and the conviction Is entertained that
the nearest approach to an invariable standard
is its establishment in one metal, which metal j
shall compose exclusively the currency for
large payments."
This law, heartily approved by Andrew
Jackson, would now be called the "crime of
1834." In 1853, upon the reDort of Senator
Hunter, when Pierce was President, and when
all branches of the Government were under
Democratic control, Congress reduced the
quantity of silver in fractional coins (naif
dimes, dimes, quarters and half dollars), more
than 6 per cent, directed the purchase of the
silver for their coinage on Government ac
count, abolished the law foi their free coinage,
and made them a legal tender for $5 only,
leaving gold still practically the only full legal
tender United States coin. At this time the
silver dollar, which had disappeared from the
current coins oi the United State', was practi
cally ana purposely demonetized. This, I
suppose, would now be called the "crime of
1853." Silver was practically demonetized by
this act and the act of 1834.
It is certain that from 1801, when Mr. Jef
ferson became President, to the close of
Buchanan's administration in 1861, the Dem
ocratic party was a gold party, opposed to sil
ver and all forms of paper money. When the
Republican party came into power in 1861 by
the election of Mr. Lincoln it had to face a
formidable rebellion. Gold and silver were
alike banished from circulation and irredeem
able paper money of all denominations, from
10 cents to $1000, was substituted in place of
coin. When the war was over the Republican
party sought to restore si>ecie payments as soon
as practicable. In March, 1869, it pledged the
faith of the Nation to payment in coin or its
equivalent of all bonds of the United States
and to redeem the United States notes at the

tiff was wanton, malicious and unpiovoked, or that it was wanton, or malicious or un
provoked.
Said defendant denies that by reason of any matter or thing in said complaint
contained plaintiff was severely injured.
As to the allegation In sai 1 complaint contained that the plaintiff suffered great
and extreme bodily pain, humiliation and mental anguish, the defendant has no in
formation or belief upon the subject sufficient to enable him to answer thereto and
placing his denial upon that ground denies that plaintiff suffered great and ex
treme bodily pain, and denies tnat plaintiff suffered great or extreme or any humilia
tion or mental anguish.
Said defendant denies that said plaintiff has been damaged in the sum of $50,000,
or any other sum, or at all.
For a further and separate answer to plaintiff's alleged cause of action this de
fendant "avers: â¢
That he is informed and believes, and on such information and belief avers that
prior to the second day of April, 1896, tue said plaintiff, H. F. Marshall, and one Don
ald M. Ross and one D. B. Woodworth, conspired together for the purpose of conceiv
ing, devising, maturing and executing an infamous and criminal scheme to blackmail
said defendant and to exact ar.d extort from him money to the extent of sixty thou
tand (?Â«0,000) dollars.
As defendant is further informed and believes, and therefore alleges, the said
Plaintiff Marshall and said Ross and said Woodworth, in furtherance of the purposes
of said conspiracy, corruptly agreed together that they would represent to thi3 de
fendant that they would publish certain false and libelous statements concerning
him if he would not yield to their shameless demands to pay them said sum of sixty
thousand ($60,000) dollars, and that they would ast and conceal the infamy of their
acts under a proposition 1b sell to the defendant, or from him borrow money upon
mortgage on, alleged mining property somewhere in the northern part of the State of
California, of which said Woodworth claimed to be the owner, and which said mining
property, aa defendant is informed and believes, and therefore avers, is worthless and
without value.
lIL
That on or about the day of March, 1896, said Donald M. Ross sought an in
terview with this defendant at his home in the City and County of San Francisco,
State of California. At said interview, and, as defendant is informed and believes and
therefore avers, as devised by said conspirators, and in furtherance of said scheme and
conspiracy, said Ross made to this defendant a pretended proposition to borrow a large
Eum of money from said defendant and to mortgage the said alleged mining property
us security therefor. Said defendant then and there promptly declined to consider
said proposition or to continue said interview; and said defendant avers that he was
not at said time aware of nor did he until afterward learn what he has since been
informed and believes to have been and therefore avers was the real object and pur
pose of said Ross,; nor did he then know of the relations existing between said Ross
and said Woodworth and the plaintiff Marshall, nor of said or any conspiracy to exact
or extort money from him.
IV.
On the 2d day of April, 1896, as defendant is informed and believes and therefore
avers, in furtherance of said scheme and conspiracy, said plaintiff Marshall and said
Ross and said Woodworth concocted a certain statement to which said plaintiff Mar
shall on said day made affidavit and in which the name of , this defendant was used.
At said time said defendant was not acquainted with either said Marshall or said
Woodworth, nor had he ever spoken to or held any communication, either orally or
in writing or by any other means, with eitUer of them, nor with said Ross except
upon the said occasion when he refused to deal with said Ross regarding said pre
tended proposition to borrow money on said alleged mining property. Nor did the
defendant thereafter, or at all, either directly or indirectly, make, or offer to make,
receive, or offer to receive, any proposition to or from said plaintiff Marshall, or said
Ross, or said Woodworth or any other person whomsoever regarding any bargain,
deal or transaction having for its purpose the delivery to said defendant, or the pre
vention of the use against the interests of said defendant, of the political or other
power of what is known as the American Protective Association, or any other asso
ciation or party or order by whatsoever name it might be known.
V.
Defendant is further informed and believes, and therefore avers, that in pursuance
of said dishonest and criminal scheme to extort money from him, and in furtherance
thereof, said Donald M. Ross and said D. B. Woodworth did, on or about the 9th day
of Aprii, 1896, go to those certain premises, 850 Market street, in said City and County
of San Francisco, for the purpose of demanding that defendant should pretend to lend
to them on said alleged mining property said sum of sixty thousand ($60,000) dollars,
but that he should in fact then and theie pay to them said sum as hush money to pro
tect himself from their threatened publication of false and untrue libels upoa him ;
and he is further informed and believes and therefore avers that at said time and
place neither said I^^ nor said Woodworth had any note for said sum of sixty thousand
($60,000) dollars, nwfor any other sum, nor any mortgage ou said alleged mining
property, nor, as defendant is informed ana believes and therefore avers, did they, or.
either of them, then and there, or at all, or ever, intend to give any note or mortgage
to said defendant for the pretended loan of sixty thousand ($60,000) dollars, or for any
other sum.
Neither at said time and place, nor at any other time or place, were said Ross or said
Woodworth together or alone, able to obtain an interview with said defendant, except
the single interview of said Ross with said defendant at his residence as hereinbefore
Eet forth.
VI.
Defendant avers that between the said 9th day of April, 1896, and the evening of
the 14th day of April, 1896, he was repeatedly informed and advised that a conspiracy
to blackmail and to extort a large sum of money from him was being matured, and
that the consummation thereof was likely to be atttempted at any time; but was un
aware of the nature and details of said scheme and conspiracy, or of the names or iden
tity, or number of the persons engaged in said criminal transaction.
VII.
On the evening of the 14th day of April, 1896, the defendant went to those certain
premises, at No. 710 Market street, in said City and County of San Francisco, to call
upon Charles M. Shortridge, an intimate personal acquaintance of said defendant.
Defendant there found said plaintiff, H. F. Marshall, accompanied by a certain man
who was and is unknown by said defendant, but who, as said defendant has since been
informed and believes, and therefore avers, was the aforesaid D. B. Woodworth.
Said plaintiff, H. F. Marshall, sought and obtained a private interview with said
defendant and said Charles M. Shortridge, leaving said Woodworth in an adjoining
room in said premises. Said H. F. Marshall then and there proceeded to, and did,
unfold to Â«aid defendant the aforesaid scheme of blackmail and extortion, which he,
the said plaintiff Marshall, together with said Donald M. Ross and said D. B. Wood
worth, had devised, and which he was Jben and there attempting to consummate.
During said interview at said time and place said plaintiff Marshall told said de
fendant that he had made an affidavit, referring thereby to said statement made on
eaid 2d day of Aprii, 1896, which said plaintiff then refused to show to said defendant,
but which he, plaintiff, said was in the possession and control of said Wood worth,
Ross and himself, and which said plaintiff then and there falsely and dishonestly
stated to defendant contained wholly and utterly false, untrue and libelous accusa
tions against the defendant.
Said plaintiff then and there told said defendant that if he, the said defendant,
would pay to himself, said plaintiff, said Ross and said Wood worth, the sum of $60,000
they would deliver to said defendant said statement and would then and there agree
with him not to make false or any libelous or other charges against him.
Said plaintiff then and there mentioned said alleged mining property, but upon
being questioned by said defendant said plaintiff admitted that said mining property
was a very immaterial element in the infamous and shameless proposition which he
was then making to eaid defendant, and that his real object was to induce the de
fendant to pay to said plaintiff, Marshall, and his co-conspirators the sum of $60,000 as
hush money.
Said plaintiff then and there informed said defendant, both by direct statement
and indirect suggestion, that if said money was not paid by said defendant, said
plaintiff and his co-conspirators would publish, or cause to be published, in certain
newspapers in said City ana County of San Francisco, said false, dishonest, perjured
and libelous charges which he then falsely and without truth represented to the de
fendant were contained in said statement, dated on said 2d day of April, 1896;
and said plaintiff then and there further insinuated, suggested, intimated and
threatened, that unless said money was paid, as aforesaid, other false and untrue
statements, slanders and libels of said defendant and of his personal and political as
quaintances and associates, would be maliciously published by said plaintiff and his
co-conspirators and by them spread throughout the State of California and elsewhere.
Said defendant thereupon questioned said plaintiff closely and thereby and from
the statements, suggestions, intimations and innuendoes of said plaintiff ascertained
that said plaintiff and his co-conspirators were engaged in a deliberate, concerted and
determined attempt to commit the crime of extortion upon and to blackmail said de
fendant, and that said Woodworth was then waiting in au adjoining room to assist
Raid plaintiff in the present accomplishment of said crime.
Said defendant is informed and belie ye& and therefore avers that at said time said
Woodworth was armed with a deadly weapon, to wit, a pistol, and that said plaintiff
knew that fact and relied upon it and upon the presence and pnysical strength of said
Woodworth to protect and aid him in the carrying out of said scheme or in the com
mission of any crime which he, the said plaintiff, might then and there attempt to
commit, and that said plaintiff also expected said Ross as his further assistant on said
occasion.
Said defendant further avers that as soon as he became aware of the infamous pur
pose of said plaintiff and his said associates and co-conspirators and of their presence
and expected presence at said time and place he charged said plaintiff with attempt
ine to commit the crime of extortion, and characterized his proposition to sell to him
said affidavit or to publish the same to be blackmail, denounced each ami all of the
statements which said plaintiff then and there asserted were contained in said affida
vit as utterly and wholly false and untrue, and told said plaintiff that he and each of
bis said co-conspirators was a villain, a blackmailing scoundrel lost to all sense of
shame and a disgrace to humanity.
Thereupon said plaintiff, H. F. Marshall, arose quickly to his feet and placed his
right hand upon or within bis right hip pocket as though to draw a weapon therefrom.
Said defendant belie vine and having cause to believe from said action and movement
of said plaintiff that he was armed with a deadly weapon with which he was then and
there about to attack said defendant, he, the said defendant, in self-defense immedi
ately struck the said plaintiff several times with sufficient force to prevent his threat
ened attack or his using any weapon upon the defendant, or of committing any further
assault or other crime. Said defendant avers that said blow and blows were necessary
fGr bis own defense against the present and probable attempt of said plaintiff to com
mit a crime or to attack or do some great bodily injury to said defendant, and to resist
tbe same, and that each and all of defendant's said acts were justifiable and necessary
to check and restrain and prevent the further prosecution by said plaintiff and his co
conspirators of their criminal scheme and conspiracy to extort money from him, and
from their pursuing and persisting in their and each of their attempts to commit said
crime.
As a further and separate defense to plaintiff's alleged cause of action, and ad
dressed particularly to that portion of plaintiff's complaint wherein he alleges that be
Buffered humiliation and mental anguish and that he was damaged in the sum of fifty
thousand- dollars by reason of the defendant's lawful resistance to said plaintiff's
criminal acts and in mitigation of plaintiff's alleged damages, tne defendant avers:
I.
That on said 14th day of April, 1596, when plaintiff exposed to this defendant
plaintiff's own perfidy in bis proposed shameless and criminal scheme and conspiracy

conspirators to pay to them said sum of sixty thousand ($60,000) dollars, said plaintiff
and his said co-conspirators would publish false, libelous and untrue statements con
cerning said defendant, said defendant, well knowing the falsity and utter lack of
truth of the statements which plaintiff threatened to publish, did cxc crate and de
nounce said plaintiff as a villain and blackmailing scoundrel, lost to all sense of
shame, and when said plaintiff arose to his feet and placed his hand in or upon his
right hip pocket, as hereinbefore alleged, said defendant in his just and justifiable
iudignation and in the heat of the moment did strike said plaintiff, but no more
violently than the circumstances as hereinabove set forth fully warranted.
Defendant is informed and believes and on such information and belief avers that
on and since said 14th day of April, 1896, said plaintiff has repeatedly been charged
with having entered into a conspiracy with said Ross and said Woodworth to extort,
and with having attempted to extort the sum of sixty thousand ($60,000) dollars from
said defendant by the blackmailing devices as in this answer set forth; avers further,
that at all of said times and to sundry persons plaintiff has, under oath aud otherwise,
admitted that he had so conspired with said Ros3 and said Woodworth, and had at
tempted to extort said sum from defendant; and avers further that at all of said times
and places and to said persons plaintiff has admitted under oath and otherwise, that
each and every statement, suggestion or innuendo, whether contained in said affidavit
dated on the 2d day of April, 1896, or made elsewhere, or by any other person, or at
any other time to the effect that said defendant had ever directly or indirectly made or
offered to make, received or offered to receive any proposition to or from said Marshall
or said Ross or said Woodworth, or any other person whomsoever regarding any Dar
gain, deal or transaction having for its purpose the delivery to said defendant, or the
prevention of the use against the interests of said defendant of the political or other
power of the American Protective Association, or of any other association or party or
order, is wholly and utterly untrue, and without the least foundation of fact.
And this defendant avers that any statement whether made in said affidavit or
not, and whether made by said plaintiff or by any other person, to the effect that he,
the said defendant, had ever negotiated with a view of making, or had ever made any
deal or bargain with any of the persons mentioned in said affidavit dated on said
2d day of April, 1896, or with any person or persons, whereby it was intended to
deliver over to said defendant or to protect him or any other person from the exercise
of the power of said American Protective Association, or of any other association or
party or order by whatsoever name it might be known, is wholly and utterly false
and untrue and without the least foundation in fact.
Wherefore defendant prays to be hence dismissed with his costs.

VIOLENT STORMS
AFTER THE HEAT.
Fierce Wind and Torren
of Water Swoop Down
on Omaha.
A MINIATURE CYCLONE
Thoroughfares Blockaded by the
Torn- Up Trees and Other
Wreckage.
HAILSTONES LIKE FOOTBALLS.
Great Damage to Windows and Roofs
Everywhere, but No Casualties
Are Reported.
OMAHA, Nebb., Aug. 15.â This city was
to-night treated to a miniature cyclone,
which played havoc with window-lights,
broke down shade trees and demolished
fences, chimneys and outbuildings. Tbe
clouds gathered in tbe northeast a little
before 6 o'clock, and swept down upon the
city with very little warning. Almost
two inches of rain fell in half an an hour,
and the downpour was accompanied by
bail. The wind-gauge at the weather sta
tion showed a velocity of fifty-six miles
an hour.
Every building in the business portion
having a north exposure suffered from
the violence of tne tempest. The Cotton
ice-house at East Omaha was entirely de
stroyed, and fences and the grandstand
at the old fair grounds suffered seriously.
At Debolt station, on the Eikhorn road,
the roof was carried away while the oper
ator was at work. He escaped without in
jury. Lightning struck in several places,
but so far as can be ascertained to-night
no one was killed. The Union Pacific oar
shops suffered severely from the hail. The
large skylights are devoid of glass. But
the greatest damage wa3 in the old resi
dence portion of the city, where the streets
are lined with stately shade trees. Some
of these thoroughfares are well-nigh im
passable, so blockaded are they with limbs
of trees, and in some instances with trees
themselves.
IOWA IS VISITED.
Terrific Storm Reported in. the Central
Portion of the State.
DES MOINES, lowa, Aug. 15.â Central
lowa, in a territory which included fifty
miles in every direction from this city,
was swept by a territic storm this evening.
To-night wires are down and railroads
under water are washed out in all direc
tions. The damage cannot be estimated.
One and a half inches of rain fell in ten
minutes in this city. At other places it is
reported even heavier. At Stuart, sixty
miles west, a high wind blew trees down
and did considerable property damage;
but there was no cyclone, as at first re
ported. Trees were blown across the rail
roads and all wires are down.
The Coon, Skunk and Beaver rivers are
all out of their banks, the Coon and Skunk
in places being five miles wide. The
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul bridge
across the Coon at Dawson was taken out.
The track is under water for miles, and
there are numerous washouts, some of
them half a mile. Along the Chicago
and Great Western conditions are even
worse. A train from Kansas City came in
during the storm that had run six mile.)
on a track that was submerged. The
Wabash train from the south came in after
the storm with a similar report. The
water has washed away an immense
amount of grain in stacks and shocks, and
will add to the ruin of crops that has been
wrought by previous storms. There has
been no report of loss of iife thus far.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, Aug. 15.â A
furious windstorm, accompanied by a
deluge of rain and bail, struck here about
6 o'clock this evening. Considerable dam
age was done, outbuildings, trees and
fences being blown down in many parts of
the city. The hailstones were the largest
seen in this part of the country for many
years, some of them measuring six inches
in circumference, breaking many win-
dows in the northern portion of the city.
Paved and unpaved streets were badly
washed.
DENISON, lowa, Aug. 15.â 1n a heavy
rain and thunder storm lightning struck
the barn of William Goodrich, killing a
team of horses. Ward Cramer was stand
ing within ten feet of the horses and a
horse was in the next stall, but neither
was stunned. A little hail fell, but did
no damage.

Oil Tanks Struck by Lightning.
LIMA, Ohio, Au<r. 15.â Early this
morning lightning struck a 36,000-barrel
oil tank on the Kemper farm, three miles
south of here, owned by the Standard Oil
Company. It was situated in a group of
such tanks, and the fire communicated to
three others. The fire was not under con
trol until uoon. The loss is between
$75,000 and $100,000.
KEELEY-CURE C ONVENTION.
Great lieiult* Accomplished During the

PITTSBURG, Pa., Aug. 15.â An army
of 300,000 has been saved from the evils of
intemperance during the past six years.
This will be one of the statements in the
report to be presented next week to the
Keeley convention in Indianapolis by Na
tional Secretary-Treasurer Thomas E.

since the last convention there has been a
steady and healthy growth in Keeley
worit in all parts of thejgountry; that tbe
year has Decn marked b^t tbe accession to
the ranks, both as cured men and as con
verts to the cause, of many prominent
men, organizations and newspapers, and
that there has been a total absence of dis
sensions in the ranks of the State and
local leagues throughout the country.
Correspondence received at National head
quarters indicates tha"t, notwithstanding
the political activity, the convention will
be the largest in the history of the league.

DEADLY DOMESTIC FEUD
A Terrible Tragedy Follows
Family Dissensions in a
Mississippi Town.
D^re Veng?anc3 of a Man Whose
Wifr, He Claims, Had Been Per
suaded to Leave Him
MEMPHIS.Tbnn., Aur. 15.â A deplor
able domestic tragedy took place on
Thursday night near tbe little town of
Clarksdale, Miss., seventy-six miles south
of this city.
â¢ Several years ago a daughter of J. M.
Howard, living near that place, married
W. P. Woods. For a while they lived
harmoniously together, but finally dif
ferences occurred and quarrels became
frequent.
Woods, who had never been regarded
with favor by the Howard family, felt
very bitterly toward his wife, father and
brothers, whom he accused of poisoning
her mind against him, and finally, when a
few weeks ago she left him, he threatened
to be revenged.
Thursday night he w,ent the house of
the Howards to persuade his wife to re
turn to him. He was ordered away by one
of the Howards, who attempted to enforce
his order, when Woods drew a pistol and
shot him dead. The noise of tbe shot
brought other members of the family to
tbe scene and for a few minutes bullets
flew fast. When the fight was ended it
was found that the father, J. M. Howard,
was mortally wounded. One of the sous,
R. L. Howard, was dead. Another son,
Will, was slightly wounded and Woods
had a bullet in his arm. Woods claims to
have acted in self-defense, but there is
very strong feeling against him in the
community.

GERMANY AND THE
CRETAN QUESTION
Hints That a Course of
Vigorous Action Is
Impending.
A PORTENTOUS SILENCE.
Great Britain, France and Rus
sia Seem to Have Reached
an Understanding.
GRAND MILITARY MANEUVERS
Exhaustive Experiments of the Great
est Importance to Be Made by
the Emperor's Troops.
BERLIN, Germany, Aug. 15.â A note
worthy silence has been observed for sev
eral days past by the semi-official press in
regard to the situation arising out of the
difficulties in the island of Crete, but the
matter, nevertheless, is seriously occupy
ing the attention of the Emperor and his
Cabinet, and it is hinted that a course of
vigorous action is impending, though
what form this procedure i 3 likely to take
it is impossible to say. The position is re
sulting in a sort of dreibund, comprising
Great Britain, France and Russia.
The question oi the blockade of the
island, of Crete has been somewhat modi
fied by the statements madq in the British
House of Commons on Thursday. These
utterances are described by the National
Zeitung as an endeavor on the part of Lord
Salisbury to pour water upon Greek fire.
The Vossische Zeitung, which has all
along been a consistent advocate of the
autonomy of Greece, imagines that the
declarations of Messrs. Curzon and Bal
four indicate the intention of Great Brit
ain to establish the autonomy of Crete,
and expresses the belief that the autonomy
of the island under the guarantee of the
foreign consuls at Canea will be the
eventual outcome of the present situation.
The belief is also growing daily among
the general public that such an outcome
in the Cretan trouble is more lively to be
reached than any other method of settle
ment. Indeed, any other solution seems
fraught with serious risk to all concerned.
A dispatch was received here from
Athens to-day to the effect that the Greek
Government circles are now more sanguine
that a speedy and satisfactory settlement
of the Cretan issue will be reached, and
this dispatch tends to strengthen the
idea of it being settled through the grant
in? of autonomy to the island.
This year's autumn maneuvers in Si
lesia and Saxony will be of special and pe
culiar interest and importance. Exhaus
tive experiments on tactical grounds will
be made. In consequence of the dis
solving tendency of the modern combat,
tactical forms are to be found which will
tend to minimize or counteract the effects
of this dissolving tendency on the troops.
Latter-day inventions in the strategic do
main are to be tested in a practical man
ner by massing numbers of troops, and
new problems in field tactics are to be
solved.
Tnese new experiments are of so much
importance, as has been realized by the
army commanders, that Germany, for in
stance, cannot longer rely upon enforcing
successes by overwhelming numbers. We,
therefore, find the German army seeking
to preserve its supremacy by other means.
For instance, the marching tempo will be
accelerated to make the material, the body
of troops, more mobile and easier to han
dle. At present the troops march one
kilometer in eight to ten minutes. This
time is to be reduced.
The bicycle is to be used to a larger ex
tent than formerly, and especially the tel
egraphic field service is to be brought to a
point of nicety and perfection. Tne cav
alry is to be fitted out with telegraphic ap
paratus from the same abundance as was
tried in 1891 during the maneuvers at
Dachen and in Bavaria. Special care will
be taken that tbe cyclists speedily repair
wires cut by the enemy.
Another, and, indeed, very important
innovation, will be established lor this
year's maneuvers â an absolutely independ
ent supreme commander of the maneuv
ers, who willdirectthe operations. Colonel
Schieffen, chief of the grand general
staff, will direct the maneuvers according
to the Kaiser's orders. From the com
mencement of the maneuvers, on Septem
ber 8, to the end of the operations, on
September 12, the opposing armies will be
as though in a state of actual warfare?
Each party will have its own supreme
commander, and there is to be no adjust
ment of positions at the end of the day's
operations. The troops will occupy next
morning exactly the position they
secured on the previous day. There will
be no time fixed when the day's opera
tions must terminate on any day and they
may be continued through the night.
For this purpose the Kaiser has ordered
that no banquets or fetes from the com
mencement of operations to the end be
But the climax of interest will be
reached probably on the last days of the
maneuvers. The operations will com
mence near Gorlitz and terminate neat
Bautzen. Something like two-thirds of
the way from Gorlitz to Bautzen lies
Hochkirch, where Frederick the Great was
so disastrously defeated on October 14,
1751 by the Austrians.
The following royalties will attend the
maneuvers: The King of Saxony, Field
Marshal Prince Regent of Brunswick,
Princes Leopold and Ludwig of Bavaria,
F;eld Marshal Prince George of Saxony,
Prince Nicholas of Wurtemburg, Arch
duke Otto of Austria, Prince Eugene of
Sweden and the Duke of Genoa.

It is alleged that the crisis over the
chancellorship has been removed, in ac
cordance with the dispatches of last week,
which stated that Prince Hohenlohe
womd not retire from the Chancellorship
for some time to come. The National
iieitung, however, learns that the recent
conferences between the Emperor and
Prince Hoheniohe have not resulted in
such a clearing up of political affairs as
would preclude the prospect of a number
of changes in the personnel of the Minis
try after the visit of the Czar to Germany
in September.
The Emperor some time ago commis
sioned Professor Kolitz, director of the Art
Academy at Kasset, to paint the portraits
of his sons, Crown Prince Wilhelm and
Prince Eitel Frederick, in the uniforms of
their Austrian regiments.
The pictures are intended as presents to
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria upon
the occasion of the monarch's sixty-sixth
birchday, which will occur on August 18.
The German warships Saxsen, Blitz and
Koenip Wilhelm made a successful pas
sage through the Holtenau lock of the
Baltic canal last night on their way to
sea, the object being to test the strategic
value of the new waterway.
THREE FRIENDS HELD UP.
The Filibustering Steamer Is Stopped by a
Revenue Cutter as She Is Leaving
Jacksonville, Fla.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Aug. 15.â The
steamer Three Friends left Jacksonville
last night presumably on a filibustering
trip to Cuba. It is said that a great quan
tity of munitions was in the hold of the
vessel covered by coal.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the Three
Friends reached the mouth of the St.
Johns and tried to cross the bar, but
found the passage barred by the United
States revenue cutter Boutwell. Captain
Kilgore ordered the Three Friends to come
to and order was obeyed. A lieutenant
was then sent on board the Three Friends.
The suspected filibuster has remained
at the bar in charge of the lieutenant, and
it is not known when she will be released.
The revenue cutter Boutwell came ud to
Jacksonville to-night. Captain Kilgore of
the Boutwell and Captain N. B. Broward
were at once brought ashore. Captain
Broward was asked if he was under arrest
and he said he was not.
He was then asked where was the Three
Friends and he said: "Down the river,
with the mate in charge." Captain Brow
ard did not think there would be any
trouble and he emphatically said : "I have
nothing on board except coal and ship
stores."
On the steamship Seminole, which ar
rived this morning from New Yorfc and
Charleston, were twenty-five Cubans, who
boarded the vessel at Cnarleston and who
were to have been put off at Mavport,
where, it is presumed, they were to make
connection with the Three Friends this
morning.
The stopping of the Three Friends, how
ever, knocked the scheme in the head,
and instead of landing the men the Semi
nole had to bring them up to the city. At
the dock they were met by Dr. Romero
and other Cuban sympathizers and were
taken from the dock to some place in the
city.

AT LOUISVILLE,
Wholesale Fouling at the
American Wheelmen's
Meet
COOPER DISaUALIFIED.
Tried to Gain an Advantage by
Unfairly Displacing a
Rival.
BAIN CURTAILED THE CARD.
Walter Sanger Made the Best Finish
of His Life In the Two-Mile
Handicap..
LOUISVILLE, Kt., Aug. 16.â The last
day of the races of the L. A. W. National
meet ended with a quarrel among the
racing men on account of fouling, the
equal of which has not been seen on the
National circuit / this year. The trouble
arose in the five-mile National champion
ship race, in which were entered all the
cracks in attendance at the meet except
danger. Cooper started the fouling by
trying to push Bald from the pole with his
hand. Bald retaliated, and after that ex
ample from the leaders nearly every man
who wanted the pole got it by pushing.
Protests were entered with President
Elliott of the league by Bald again?t
Coooer, Cooper against Bald, Coburn
against Cooper and Gardiner against Cal
iahan. The finish was: Cooper first, W.
E. Becker of St. Paul second and E. S.
Acker of Philadelphia third. The time
was 12:18 2-5.
The officials took an hour to decide the
matter of the protests and the result was
that Cooper was disqualified for fouling
and the race given to Becker, with Acker
second and Nat Butler third. There is no
appeal from this decision. A heavy rain
storm prevented the running of the last
race on the card, the professional trial for
one mile unpaced, and that event was
called off.
The attendance to-day was the largest of
the meet. Excursions had been run from
all points within 300 miles of Louisville.
Fully 10,000 people were in attendance at
tne races. They saw Walter Sanger make
the best finish of his life in the two-mile
professional Handicap. His time was
within one-fifth of a second of the world's
record.
There was no meeting of the racing
board to-day, as nad been expected, and the
matter of the charges against almost all
the amateurs that were entered in tne
National meet races that they were in the
pay of manufacturers will be investigated
at a called meeting, if at all. In a letter
to the Meet Club President Elliott and
Chairman Gideon of the racing board de
clared the Louisville meeting the most
succes~iu! in point of entertainment that
has ever been held by the league. The
wind-up of the meet was held at tne
league headquarters to-night. Sum

LIONIZING II HTJNG CHANG.
England Takes the American View
of the Cuban QuestionâCom
ments on Nansen's Work,
fCopyrleht 1880 by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Eno., Aug. 15.â 1t is reported
here that Bryan's failure to capture the
imagination of New York has gravely dis
concerted those about him. It certainly
caused deep disappointment to specula
tive citizens in London. When Monday's
sudden flurry sent down American prices
here in many cases below the level
touched In last winter's Venezuelan panic
thousands of buyers were restrained from
investing by a rumor that everything was
going to be still cheaper on Thursday. It
was said that Bryan's reception and
speech on Wednesday would "stand Wall
street on its head," so that American se
curities could be picked up in the streets
next day when New York quotations
reached London, and this obtained general
credence. When Thursday passed without
a convulsion word went around that it
was to take place on Friday. Now, with
prices risinir and a lot of confidence re
flected from America which has not been
heard before for a month, people abandon
with a sigh the idea that American prop
erties are going to be had for nothing this
year and blame the evil luck which kept
them from rushing in on Monday.
Personal letters from Germany empha
size the impression given by the German
pres3 that grave and increasing uneasiness
rules in the fatherland. The Emperor's
suuden retirement to a country chateau in
Cassel, where he takes long solitary walks
in the forest and is seen to wear a somber
and distraught face, has given rise to a
wildly careering flock of rumors about the
state of his health. These reports need
not to be closely examined, but there is
more substance in the view that Germany
finds herself wading in deep and danger
ous waters, and that the Emperor's mood
only mirrors tbe perplexed and apprehen
sive feeling of the Empire at large, which
is the result of two years of juggling with
diplomatic dishonesties and of sacrificing
half a million Armenians to the Turkish
beast.
Germany now discovers herself to be
rather worse off than before. Her aim
was at all hazards to isolate England.
Â£be offered Russia and France an abso
lutely free band in destroying British
prestige in tbe far east, and even joined to
help them on the Pacific if only they
would give England the cold shoulder in
the Levant. This was Bismarck's concep
tion of the way to keep peace in Europe,
which, to his mind, hangs on the question
of maintaining the Turkish Empire intact.
This policy involved some of the most
atrocious crimes against civilization that
are recorded in history, but Bismarck in
sisted that it was only thus that Germany
could escape being crushed between Rus
sia and France and the Emperor, against
his own better feelings, took Bismarck's
advice. He has incurred all the ndium of
upholding the Sultan and of holding the
rest of Europe back, when every humane
impulse tugged to draw tbe sword of
Christendom against the Turk, and he has
worse than nothine to show for it.
Russia and France have left Germany
absolutely in the lurch, and at the present
moment it is understood here that they
are ready to agree with England, under
certain conditions, to tell the Turk that
he has been in Crete too long and must
get out. I have extremely good authority
for tne prediction that these three powers
will arrange a scheme of Cretan autonomy
similar to that of Bulgaria in 1878 which
will remove the Turkish officials and
troops from the island and reduce the Sul
tan's sovereignty to the receipt of an an
nuity tribute.
The Cretans have already 40,000 breech
loaders and more are being landed regu
larly from Greece. In all, Crete can raise
70,000 fighting men, not counting Greek
volunteers. Turkey has 35,000 troops in
the island, but if independence were de
clared she would need 100,000 more to cope
with the islanders. Moreover, if actual
warfare began and the Turks started in to
tight as they understand fightiner, it
would be absolutely impossible to hold
Greece neutral, and almost as hard to
keep England from intervening. Hence,
my informant thinks the Sultan will ulti
mately choose the wiser course â make as
good a bargain as he can and let Crete go.
Two possible obstacles are foreseen.
During the delays which the Turfc always
demands in which to consider things,
events may happen which will set the
east afire and force immediate armed ac
tion upon the part of those concerned.
Again, the pro-German palace clique in
Russia may find a means of reasserting
itself and putting the power once more
into Lobanoffs hands; but, as regards
this latter chance, fate fights against Ger
many.
Tbe Czar is to first visit Vienna for a
couple of days, but will return again at
once into Russian territory. Then he is
to come westward into Germany but a lit
tle way, seeing the Emperor only at Bres
lau and Gorlitz, where immense army
maneuvers will enable him to appear as a
strictly military guest. Instead of proceed
ing to Berlin or through Germany he will
then turn again and go to Denmark by
water, and thence to Scotland. Both at
Copenhagen and Balmoral the Czar's
visits will be of a friendly nature and all
those about him will be ultra-Greek and
Cretan in sympathy. From England he
will sail to Cherbourg and travel on to
Paris, where his reception will be some
thing to remember for the rest of one's
days.
In all this programme tbe enemies of
Germany play a huge part and the effect
of this is bound to culminate at the French
capital, where already there is observable
an extraordinary and quite unexpected
recrudescence of anti-German bitterness.
All the forced politeness that has been
shown in the relations between Berlin and
Paris during these past few years has been
totally torpotten now, and the mere hint
that the Kaiser was trying to arrange a
meeting with M. Faure and get a presi
dential invitation to visit the Paris exhi
bition of 1900 has drawn a roar of enraged
protests from the French press.
So the lightnings will continue to play
around a very dark and unpleasant inter
national situation for a couple of months
to come.
The Parliamentary session now closed
was one of the shortest on record, lasting
only 124 days, but 1 have rarely seen a
prorogation that was greeted with more
tokens of relief by the members. They are
as ostentatiously jubilant about getting a
rest as if they had been at work for years.
It was, indeed, a specially wearing session,
for the very reason that it did no work to
speak of, or at least accomplished next to
nothing in the way of results. A month
or two ago Mr. Balfour was way down in
the trough of the sea as a leader, but he
finishes perched gaily on the crest of a
wave of new popularity. He and his
brother Gerald toiled arduously over the
Irish land bill, and thus won the respect
of the House as capable managers. But
they achieved something more than this â
they opened the way to a whole new Irish
policy for the Tory party, the prospect of
which rather pleases that party than
otherwise. It has always been pointed
out that, other things being equal, there
was more in common between the Tories
and the Irish than between the Irish and
the Liberals.
Practically all the militant anti-Catholic
feeling in England is inside the Liberal
party, and this from the dawn of the
hotne-rula alliance has been a weak point
in- the partnership. It now looks as if
that partnership were in a lair way to be
dissolved. The Balfours have carried
their point in the Cabinet, both as to
"sitting on" the Irish landlords in the
House of Lords and as to releasing the
group of imprisoned dynamiters. They
are confident of their ability to lead the
Government a good deal further in the
work of pacification and reform if the
Irish themselves will back up the prac
tical men among their representatives and
thus render mutual understanding pos
sible.
Not since the first visit here of the late
Shah of Persia has London been so de
lighted in any guest as it has in Li Hune
Chang. Columns and columns are given
daily by the papers to his sayings and
doings, and no one wearies of reading
them. He seems to have gauged the
English character very shrewdly and to
have seen that they are most easily and
surely amused by having strangers score
genial, but more or less cheeky, points off
themselves. The Viceroy now regularly
quizzes everybody who is presented to
him and asks them all sorts of extraordi
nary personal questions, which, being
publicly put and answered through an in
terpreter, provide the bystander with a
broadly humorous entertainment.
Li's visit to Gladstone to-day was quite
in keeping with the high sagacity which
he has shown all along, and particularly
in the matter of decorating General Gor
dan's statue. The really important part
of Li Hung Chang's British tour has now
begun, for the things which he is to see in
the industrial north cannot help produc
ing a powerful and determining influence
on his mind. Lord Armstrong, who is his
chief host, has at present more Japanese
orders on hand than even his vast works
can accommodate, and so he has bad to
place a Jot of them outside with other
northern firms. A partner in one of these
firms tells me a particular story, which, I
imagine was not known before, namely,
that Armstrong has taken the job oÂ£ build
ing and entirely eauippinga bignavalyard
and dock in Japan, where ships can be not
only built, but armored, engined and com
pletely fitted by the Japanese themselves.
Some" of his men are already out there
making preliminary plans and esti
mates. It is the notion that when Li
grasps this fact he will say that China
must also have one.
A good deal is said in the papers just
now about an impending general strike of
labor in the shipping trade. The plan of
this strike as propounded is certainly am
bitious enough, for it threatens a refusal
! to unload any ship the crew of which con
j tains non-unionists, and this is to apply
not only to British ports, but to continen
tal and American ports as well. The fact,
however, that Lock Wilson is managing
the whole thing rather robs it of its ter
rors, for even the densest workingman's
mind must by this time know what kind
of a man Wilson is. Shipowners are not
neglecting precautions to meet a possible
emergency, but they think that Wilson is
really intent on whipping up members for
his union at 70 cents each and that the
matter will end there.
The personal firmness of the United
States Minister at Madrid in reading the
riot act to the Spanish Government and
I preventing it from sending a circular note
to the European powers in regard to Cuba
is much praised here. It was the British
Embassador at Madrid, I hear, who
warned Mr. Taylor of what was going on
and who also warned the Spanish Foreign
Office that it was making a mistake.
It is inevitable that the Spanish Minis
try should be a good deal influenced by
the fact that the European powers are on
the verge of a big quarrel among them
selves, and if the truth were known we
should probably find a division among
the diplomats stationed at Madrid follow
ing closely the lines of that at Constan
tinople; in other words, it would be dis
covered that Germany was eegmg Bpain
on to rash ccurses, that England was

against them, and that the other powers
were drifting about watching 10 see how
tne cat will jump.
After seven years of examination, dur
ing which three of the original members
died, probably of old age, the Eoyal Com
mission on Vaccination is at last ready to
report. It accepts the vaccination prin
ciple as right, as of course was inevitable,
but will advise that vaccination no longer
be compulsory where parents object to it,
and will suggest that a statutory declara
tion of objection by such parents be ac
cepted as a reason for immunity.
This report, it is to be feared, will be
hailed with fervid enthusiasm by a large
class of people, who confound vaccination
itself with the vaccination law and who
hold it responsible for the effects produced
by the vaccination of infants who do not
receive proper care, either from those who
perform the operation or from their par
ents after it has been performed. There
is hardly any other law which causes such
a vehement and bitter feeling among the
poor as does that one which enforces the
vaccination of their children before they
are three months old. With many of
these children the chances whether they
| will live or die are pretty even at that
period and vaccination among people de
pendent on the often careless dispensary of
ficials sometimes tips the balance toward
death. In such cases the funeral of the
little unfortunates become public demon
strations in which whole slum districts
participate. Banners are carried and
speeches are made cursing the Govern
ment as a murderer of inuocents.
In many large towns this sentiment is
so strong that the class of ignorant peo
ple who hold it is so numerous that the
local officials have allowed tne law to be
come a dead letter, a thing which in Eng
land is almost unheard of. The terrible
effect of this was recently seen at Glouces
ter in the shape of an epidemic of small
pox that carried off hundreds of victim*.
The entire hopelessness of Sir John Mil
lais' case had been known so long that his
death created no sensation. He will be
buried in St. Paul's, probably at Lord
Leignton's feet, but the funeral will be no
such solemn state affair as was that ot the
other. Speculation as to Mjllais' successor
is already very keen. W. B. Richmond,
Luke Fielaea and^larcus Stone all have
supporters, but to me Val Prinseps' chance
seems best. The theory cf hereditary in
stitutions gets a quaint illustration from
the fac ttbat M illais' eldest son has no in
terest whatever in anything but dogs, and
his sole distinction in life is that he is the
greatest living authority on Basset hounds.
It is true tliat he only inherits the bar
onetcy, but it might as easily have been a
peerage, which would have made this ex
pert in sporting dogs a hereditary law
maker because his father was a great
artist.
After numerous vague bints it is at last

lias been made there in dresses yet, al
though a recognized tendency in that di
rection exists. In London, however, the
change is already very marked. In the
beginning it was confined to cycling hab
its, but it is now spreading rapidly to
walking costumes and even to evening
dress. This new mode is called "the Gre

MONO SILVERITES
ABE ASSAILED,

earliest practical moment in coin. In order to
carry out these pledges it became necessary to
revise the various coinage laws of the United
States. This was promptly and very carefully
done by a bill framed in the Treasury Depart
ment while Mr. Boutwell was Secretary.
This b'll omitted from the coins of the United
States the eilver dollar, precisely as was done
in 1853, but provided for the coinage of the
fractional parts of the dollar, in accordance
with the act of that year. This bill was pend
ing in Congress for three yearsâ was carefully
considered in both houses, and special atten
tion was called to the omission of the 41 - l 2
grains silver dollar which was never in the bill
at any stage, and the reasons for this omission
given. The biti passed both houses and be
came a law February 12, 1873, by practically a
unanimous vote of both parties, and was espe
cially supported by the Senators and members
from the silver States. This has been called
"the crime of 1873," and as the bill was un
der my charge iv the Senate, I was held to be
the chief criminal. It was, in fact, a wise
measure of public policy, carefully discussed
and considered during three years.
It is strange that the very men who sup
ported the coinage of 1873 and demanded the
exclusive use of gold are the very men who de
mand the free coinage of silver and denounce
as "goldites" and "robbers" all those who be
lieve in the coinage of both gold and silver.
Senator Sherman quoted from speeches
delivered in 1874 by Senators Jones and
Stewart of Nevada, favoring a gold stand
ard, and continued:
Senators Jones and Stewart and all the Rep
resentatives a;iid Senators of all the silver
States were honest and urgent in saying that
gold was the best and only standard of value,
but they changed their minds when the largely
increased and increasing production of silver
in Nevada and other States reduced the
market value of silver below that of gold at
the established ratio of 16 to 1. When the
coinage law of 1873 was enacted neither gold i
nor silver was used in domestic transactions, !
but we collected our customs duties in gold j
coin and conducted our foreign commerce in |
gold, the money of the world. It was not until j
January, 1873, ihat the first step was taken to
resume specie payments, nor did wo resume ,
until January, 1879. During this period j
silver rapidly fell in market value below gold
at the ratio of 16 to 1.
Prior and subsequent to 1873 many changes
were made in coinage by the leading countries
of the world, and gold became the standard of
! values in those countries, but in all silver was !
coined and largely used as a subsidiary coin, I
precisely as in the United States. The Bland
bill, if it bad become a law as it passed the
House, would have demonetized gold. When j
the bill came to the SenaÂ»e an amendment
was made on motion of Senator Allison which
changed the scope of the bill, and authorized
and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to
purchase from time to time silver bullion at
the market price not less than $2,000,000 nor
more than $4,000,000 worth per month, and ,
cause the same to be coined into silver dollars j
as fast as purchased. This blri, so amendeu,
passed both houses. It was known en the
Bland-Allison act. It greatly added to the dif- |
faculties of resumption, and for that reason I
was vetoed by President Hayes, but became a j
law over his veto. Under its provisions the j
United States purchased over 291,000,000
ounces of silver at the cost of $308,279,260. It
was hoped that this enormous purchase would
arrest the decline of silver, but in spite of it i
silver steadily declined in market value, and j
at the present price the loss to the Govern
ment on the purchase of silver under this act
amounts to over $100,000,000.
Senator Sherman then reviewed tbe pas
sage of the act of July 18, 1890, providing
for the purchase of silver at the market
price, issuing in payment therefor treasury |
notes, and its repeal in November, 1893. j
He continues:
We cannot by law fix the value of either
metal or coin or of any of the articles that
enter into the wants of life. The great law of
demand and supply affects the value as it
does iron, copper or zinc. All have fallen in
market value by means of new discoveries and
improved methods of production. We had
July 1, last, in actual circulation among the
people of the United States, $1,509,725,200.
We had also at that date $684,519,981 in the
treasury, mostly gold and silver, held for the
redemption of United States notes and silver
certificates. All these forms of money have
been maintained by the Government at par
witji gold and they travel the circie of the
world without diminution of their purchasing
power.
Though silver bullion has fallen to nearly
one-half its former value, yet we have used it
and maintained silver coin made from it at a
parity with gold at the ratio of 10 to 1. But
now we ore brought face to face with a propo
sition which, If agreed to, will make silver the
sole standard of value for all debts and credits,
for the wages of labor and thepuichase and
sale of property. The Democratic party at its
recent convention at Chicago adopted a reso
lution in favor of the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1.
With the free coinage of silver Jtold will be
demonetized. Nothing can be more certain
j than that the cheaper money only will circu
late. The United States has tbus far main
tained its silver coins at parity with gold coins
only by its exclusive monopoly of coinage and
by limiting the amount, but with free coinage
of silver there could be no limitation. Silver
bullion in every form will be pressed upon the
mints and, with the mandatory duty of free
coinage, silver dollars will soon fill the chan
nels of circulation and the sold dollar will be
| hoarded or will be quoted and sold as a com
; modity. Silver will stand ai the par of value
and gold will be quoted at its commercial
value. liCt us coti template for awhile the in
evitable result of the free coinage of silver,
even if I repeat what I say.
It would violate every contract for the pay
ment of money made since January 1,1879.
The resumption act, which went into opera-
I tion on that day, provided for the payment in
coin on demand of all United States bonds
presented for redemption. All forms of money,
whether of silver or gold or paper, were then
maintained at par with each other and have
been so â¢ maintained ever since. During all
, j this period gold and silver coins at par with
j each other have been the standard of value of
. all loans, contracts or purchases, and the faith
of the United States was pledged for their
maintenance at parity with each other. Al
| though silver bullion declined in market value
; the coins made from it have been kept at par
with gold coins at the legal ratio of 16 to 1.
. But if the free coinage of silver is authorized
i then the market value of silver bullion be
, comes the standard -for the payment of all con
.tracts made in the past, the present or the fu
ture, and 412}-j grains of standard silver bul
lion, worth now 53 cents, can with free coin
- i age be coined into a dollar upon the demand
of any holder of such bullion. It is the doc
trine of the Populist and the anarcnist, but is
in direct opposition to the traditional policy
of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and the
Democratic party-
It is impossible to estimate the injustice
that will be done to creditors by the scaling of
nearly one-half of the debts due them. The
very threat to d.o it will lead to the prompt
and harsh collection of debts before free coin
age can become law. It is certain that before
a free-coiuage bill can become a law the wide
distrust caused by tbe pending of such a
measure will lend to tne rapid collection of
debts, the sacrifice of property, and deepen
the existing financial difficulties growing out
of insufficient revenues for the National as
well as for many State governments. The
great body of the creditors of our country are
among the thrifty, industrious and intelligent
men and women of every community. One
great body of creditors here is the 970,000
Union soldiers, their widows and orphans, who
i are creditors of the United States to the
j amount of over $140,000,000 a year for ser-
I vices and sacrifices in the Union army. It
j would be an act of perfidy and meanness
i beyond expression for this great country to
i pay them with money of less purchasing
j power than gold coin, merely because the I
j overproduction of silver in the United States
has reduced the market value of silver bullion
contained in a silver dollar.
There is another class of creditors that the
free coinage of silver will greatly injure. It is
the depositors in savings institutions and
! kindred organizations, who, according to offi
j cial statistics, number nearly 5,000,000 people
' and whose deposits amount to more than
; $1,800,000,000. Free coinage will also wipe
I out nearly one-half the value of life insurance,
which provident people of the United States
have paid, to secure in case of their death,
| some support and protection to wife and
children. It will affect injuriously the multi
tude of clerks and employes who depend upon
monthly pay, and will reduce the purchasing
, power of all salaries of officers and employes
j in the public service of the United States and
ot every State, county, city or township in this
broad land.
But by far the greatest injury resulting
! from the free coinage of silver will fall on
j workingmen. Their wages are now based
| upon money of the highest value, upon gold
coin of standard value. Under free coinage of
silver the value of the silver dollar will fall to
53 cents in gold, or the 100 cents of the gold
j dollar will be worth 194 cents of the silver
j dollar.
Of all the evils which a government can in
flict none can be greater than cheap money,
whether of coin or paper. That dollar is the
best dollar that buys the largest quantity of
food and clothing. That dollar is the gold dol
lar, for It buys more food and clothing than
j any other dollar, and will also buy a silver
dollar for 53 cents if the coinage of silver is
j made free at the ratio of 16 to 1 of gold.
Experience has shown that the United States
can make the silver dollar buy as much as the
gold dollar, but it can only be done by the
Government buying silver bullion as needed
and coining it into dollars on Government ac
count. This has been tried. The only object
and effect of free coinage will be to degrade
the dollar, to lessen its purchasing power
nearly one- half, to enable debtors to pay their
debts at 53 cents for a dollar, and to cheat the
public creditors who hold our bonds. If this
policy should be adopted the United States
will take its place among the nations of the
earth as a bankrupt, closing its business at 53
cents on the dollar.
There is another element of meanness In
this $ree coinage of silver. The United States
has always paid its bons in gold coin or its
equivalent. In the darkest hour of the Civil
War we stipulated to pay our bonds, principal
and Interest in gold or its equivalent. All of
the war debt has been paid in this way. A por
tion of it was paid by the sale of bonds bearing
a lower rate of interest, but we exacted of the
purchasers of these bouds gold coin or its
equivalent even while our notes* were below
par in coin. About $347000,000 of these se
curities are now outstanding, of which $262,
--000,000 was sold by this administration and
paid for in gold coin. It is one of the objects
of those who advocate the free coinage of sil
ver to force the Government to pay these
bonds in silver coin reduced in vaiue. I can
not regard this in any other light, but as both
fraud and a robbery and all the worse if com
mitted by a great, rich and free people.
The matter of the free coinage of silver and
the degradation of the standard of value in
volves not oniy questions of money but of
honor and good faith. When their honoris
involved the people never fail to respond.
They have complied with every promise and
paid every debt contracted since the organiza
tion of the Government as it became due.
They have paid four-fifths of the debts con
tracted during the Civil War and the prospect
was hopeful that all of it would be paid before
the close of this century, but this reversing
our standard of value has, like the firebell at
night, startled and alarmed our people. Let
us settle it by following the action of Wash
ington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Benton, Hunter,
Lincoln and Grant. Let us maintain silver
and gold at par with each other at the legal
ratio of 16 to 1 until a conference among na
tions can prescribe common standards of
value- In the meantime let no act be done,
no policy be adopted, no expedient resorted to
that will tarnish the honor of this great re
public.
When Senator Sherman finished Gov
ernor iJushnell introduced Senator-elect
J. B. Foraker. The cheering which greeted
him last d two or three minutes. When
he mentioned McKmley's name in his
opening remarks the scene which followed
was for a short time like the memorable
one in the St. Louis convention when he
named McKinley in his nominating
speech.
Mr. Foraker said :
Mr. Chairman and Fellow Citizens: For
three years in succession Republican major
ities, in this State and throughout the coun
try, have been overwhelming; 1893, 1894
and 1895 show an increasing strength for Re
publicanism and corresponding losses for
Democracy. These election verdicts have been
the people's condemnation of Democratic mal
administration in National affairs.
What has happened since the elections of
last year to change the verdict of the people as
then" recorded? In administration, nothing.
In legislation, nothing. Nobody pretends that
Mr. Cleveland or anybody else has done any
thing to redeem Democracy from the faults
for which it was condemned last year. Why
then should there be a contest for supremacy
this year? Why should it be necessary to hold
this meeting, or any other meeting, for the
purpose of debating whether we shall vote the
Republican or Democratic ticket'/
Why should there be any effort to secure the
election of a Republican President? Why
does .-iot the verdict of last year stand good
for this? The answer i.", there is a new issue.
The money question has been brought to the
front and we are to determine whether or not
we shall have free silver. Why has this new
issue been made? What is the nature of it?
What is the right of it? It has been born ot
Democratic desperation ou the tariff question,
which has been the issue for years. They
ware overwhelmingly defeated before the
light commenced. Their victory in 1892
proved to them a great misfortune. It gave
them an opportunity to present an object
lesson to the American people. Coming into
power on the plea of opposition to protection,
it was necessary for them to legislate accord
ingly. They did so and that has worked their
ruin. Before 1892 the tariff was a debatable
question. Everybody understands the tariff
question now and almost everybody has be
come a protectionist.
It was because of our political experience iv
these regards that the Republican party has
been triumphing by such tremendous majori
ties and it is because the end is not yet, be
cause hard times continue, because men are
still idle, because farmers are still distressed,
wage-earners stili seeking employment, busi
ness paralyzed and ;he Government revenues
insufficient to meet the Government expenses,
that it was seen months ago that in November,
1896, upon thi old issues the Democratic
party would be overwhelmingly defeated, and
for that reason it was determined that some
thing must be done to give the Democracy a
new chance. In other words, if the Demo
cratic party had not seen its defeat ahead on
its ohl issues it would not have made this new
issue.
But what is this silver question? Is it true
that the Democratic parly, which has been
constantly and persistently on the wrong side
of every great National question for fifty years,
is at last and ior once right? No, it is not. On
the contrary, it is more wrong now than ever
before, since the Union was saved and slavery
abolished. Democrats themselves so (assert.
Their most distinguished and trusted leaders
unsparingly condemn their platform and re
fuse to support their candidate. Half of the
party is now in open revolt. Almost all the
leading Democratic newspapers of the North,
from tbe Atlantic to the Mississippi, have de
nounced and refused to support this platform
or the candidates of the party who stand
upon it.
In view of this it is hardly necessary to re
sort to argument, and yet when a great party
puts forth a decision upon an Important sub
ject it ia our duty to examine it and dispose of
it upon Its merits. But before we can judee of
any question we must know exactly what that
question Is. This is particularly true in the
present case, for much effort is being ii:ade to
cause it to appear that the Republican party
has changed us position. That is not true. It
stands exactly where it has been standing
heretofore. Its St. Louis platform is but a
repetition of all Its previous declarations on
tne currency question. It is not so explicit,
but in substance and effect it is precisely iden
tical. Briefly and simply stated our position
is that we propose to maintain what we have
until we can get something better. What we
have is the single gold standard, with the use
I of the largest quantity of both silver and paper
I that can be maintained on a par with gold.
Uhut we want is the double, or bimetallic,
standard, under which we can have, not only
the free coinage of both metals, but the actual
use of both metals as we now have, with the
additional use of silver for redemption pur
poses. We propose to secure this by interna
tional agreementâ the only possible way, in
i our judgment, that has ye*t been po.nted out.
Our position is not, therefore, in hostility to
silver, as has been claimed, but one that de
mands such a use and treatment of silver as
will maintain it in honorable parity with
gold. We have now in use not only gold and
silver, but six different kinds of paper money.
The grand aggregate amounts to more than
f 1,500,000.000. Speaking in round figures,
$900,000,000 of this is in silver and paper and
only $Â«00,000,000 iv gold, and yet all is main
tained at a par with gold, simply because all
is redeemable in gold.
The commercial value of gold and silver is
not 16 to 1, but almost 32 to 1. It is self
evident that a silver dollar worth only 53
cents could not be maintai ned at par with gold
unless made redeemable in golu, but a car
dinal principle iv the doctrine of free coinage
is that neither gold nor silver shall be redeem
able the one in the other, but each shall staud
upon its own merits as a money of ultimate
redemption. It is one thing to declare that
you wili redeem in gold and another that you
will mtfke and keep yourself able to so redeem.
As it is with an indlviduil so, too, is it with
the Government. For this reason*he Republi
can party- has pursued the policy of limiting
the obligations of the Government to amounts
conceded to be within the ability of the Gov
ernment to pay.
Notwithstanding all this the Democratic

party declares for the free, unlimited and in
dependent coinage of silver at the ratio oi xo
to 1. What does this declaration mean I iney
tell us it means bimetallism, and they denne
this to mean tnat silver is not only to be freely
coined, but that It is to be no longer redeem
able in gold, but is to be Itself a money of re
demption. If their policy prevails and you
have a paper dollar and want it redeemed in
coin you will be compelled to accept silver, it
silver is offered. We deny that bimetallism,
in the sense that both gold and silver shall
circulate together as moneys of ultimate re
demption, can be brought about by any such
methods. We, on the contrary, assert that
what the Democrats propos? will give us not
bimetallism, but silver monometallism. The
very moment that we, acting alone, without
the co-operation of other nations, enter upon
a policy of free coinage of silver at the ratio of
16 to 1, as the Democrats propose, the United
States will pnss to a silver basis.
It" we would undertake to maintain it at par
with gold by redeeming it in gold It would be
impossible for us to do it. There would
be too much of it. But as already
stated it is not proposed under free coinage to
redeem silver iv gold, but on the contrary that
is inconsistent with the whole idea of free
coinage. Tbe theory of free coinage is silver
shall be in itself a money of redtmption, and
if a money of redemption there would be no
more propriety in redeeming silver in gold
than there would be in redeeming gold in sil
ver.
Silver, therefore, must under free coinage
stand alone upon its own merit, and its value
must be measured by its intrinsic value, that
is at the raiio named only about one- naif the
intrinsic value of gold. We would consequent
ly have two metal coins ot unequal value, but
moneys of redemption. Gold would go in
stantly to a premium, and the moment it
would go to a premium it would go out of cir
culation.
When a man has a dollar to pay he will pay
it with the cheapest dollar at his command.
Wita gold out of circulation we would have
only paper and silver money, and inasmuch as
all the paper and all the bonds and all the
other obligations of the Government are re
deemable in coin they would be redeemed only
m sliver.
We would at once step down and out from
the class in which we stand with England,
France, Germany and other great commercial
nations of the earth into the class with Japan,
China and Mexico.
To that step the Republican party will not
contribute. So long as we control this Govern
ernment the American people will rank with
the first-class nations of the earth. Our flag
shall be everywhere respected and our money
everywhere honored. Ii you want a practical
illustration of what we would avoid look at
the Mexican doilar. It contains more; pure,
silver than our silver dollar, and yet one of
our dollars Is practically worth two Mexican
dollars.
Jhisissobecau.se our dollar is redeemable
in gold, while the Mexican dollar is not. They
have free silver in Mexico. They are on a sil
ver basis. In that country silver is a money
of redemptionâ just what the Democratic party
proposes to make it here. Payment iv silver
is the end of a business transaction.
As a currency, the silver dollar is worth just
what the bullion it contains makes it worth,
that is worth whatever silver may be worth in
the market for commercial purposes. The
same is true In substance and effect in every
other silver country and as it is elsewhere, so
will it be here. It is for this reason that we
deny that free coinage means bimetallism and
assert that i t means ouly sliver monometallism,
and we are opposed to it. Until we can have bi
metallism, we prefer the gold standardto the
silver standard. We want to continue the use
ol the best money of the world. We want to
maintain it in the future as we have in the
past, the highest monetary standard known
among civilized nations. We want to pre
serve the use of goid, together with silver
and paper, ana Hre opposed to a policy that
would drive Â¥600,000,000 of gold out of circu
lation and thereby correspondingly contract
our currency, derange our business and leave
us with no other metal except silver. We are
opposed to free coinage because its avowed
purpose Is to have a cheaper money with
which to pay debtr.. We are not repudiators.
We believe In an honest discharge oi an honest
obligation.
It is not the demonetization of silver that
has hurt the farmer, but the demonetization
of his markets. The repeal ot the McKinley
law carried with it the repeal of our recipro

1895. as compared with the year 1894, to the
amount of more than $250,000,000. c
Now I want to call your attention to another
plank in the Democratic platform, one that is
in my judgment, more serious in its character'
if that be possib c, than the silver plank, n
is that which assails and threatens to destroy
the Supreme Court of the Lnited States and
denounces the Federal courts generally, be
cause of what it is pleased to term "Govern
ment by injunction." The assault upon the
Supreme Court is on account of its decision
that an income tax is unconstitutional. But
no matter what the excuse, the fact remains
that the higbeÂ»t tnbuual in America has been
openly and deliberately assailed by a political
party "in its political platform, and the declara
tion and pledge have been given that if that
party snail succeed at the coming election the
Supreme Court shall be so reorganized as to
make it subservient to the whims ot a political
body. AH this because the Supreme Court has
discharged its constitutional duty.
But they do not stop with this assault ut>on
the Supreme Court. They go tart her. They
arraign all the Judges of our federal courts.
The entire Federal judiciary are included in
their attack upon what they -are pleased to
term "Government by injunction. \\ho can
forget how iv the summer of 1894 this coun
try seemed to be on the verge of anarchy T
Who can forget how at that time, angered and
maddened by their wrongs, real and unagin
ary the striking rioters in the city oi Cuicago
undertook by violence to supplant the civil
authorities, inter:ere with interstate com
merce and prevent the carrying of the mans
of the United States ? This declaration ol this
platform has reference to this incident. Read
in the light oi this fact, it is the purpose of the
Democratic party, as declared by this piat
form, to give us not only iree trade ani free
silver, but to give also free license to every
man who sees fit to take the scepter into his
own hands, and defying the constituted au
thorities, substitute riot and anarchy, blood
shed and violence for law aua order, peace and
prosperity.
If any Judge abuses his powers the law pro
vides a remedy whereby he can be impeached,
displaced and'punished. So long as he admin
isters the law in accordance with hi* oath of
office no man or party has any right to com
plain. This declaration ot the Democratic
platform is an attack upon the very founda
tions of our Government. It is revolutionary
in its character. It is anarchical. It is un-
American. It is enough in and of itself, if it
stood alone, to condemn the party that would
adopt it and defeat the man who would ap
prove and stand upon it before the people.
Let us try no more experiments with De
mocracy. Let all who believe in law and order,
the maintenance of our institutions, a sound
currency and the prosperity of America rally,
as did tbe patriots of 1861, to the support of
William MeKinley. lie has been nominated
by the Republican party. He is a Republi
can. His administration will be along Repub
lican lines, but he is also a patriot. He repre
sents in name, in record, in purpose, all that is
bt ;t and grandest in his day and generation.
With him at the helm no harm can come to the
American people. He will give us a broad,
comprehensive, aggTessive American adminis
tration.
The meeting closed to-nisht with an ad
dress in the great tent by General Stewart
L. Woodford of New York. The audience
was even larger than that which listened
to tue speeches of Senator bherman and
Senator-elect F )ral:er this afternoon, con
sisting mainly of workingmen. A glee
cluo of 100 male voices, accompanied by a
great organ on the stage, sang patriotic
and campaign songs.
Mr. Woodford stated briefly the position
of the three principal parties as set forth
in their platforms. He said he believed
and would try to prove that the Demo
cratic declaration if carried into effect
would reduce us to silver monometallism,
where Mexico, China and India are. He
gave three illustrations of Populist finance
from history, the first beinir the issuance
of paper money by John Law, Minister cf
Finance in France, in 1720; the second the
issue of paper assignats and mandats in
1790 and 1796, and the third the issue
of continental bills by our own Con
tinental Coneress between 1775 and 1780.
All of these experiments were disastrous
and that of the Continental Congress ended
in complete repudiation.

IN FRESNO JAIL
The Murderer Surrenders
to Officers at Sequoia
Mills.
YIELDS TO STARVATION.
Three Days Passed in a Hiding
Place Without Food or
Drink.
WOULD-BE LYNCHERS FOILED.
The Prisoner Hurried Away Before
Enraged Loggers Can Gather
in Force.
FRESNO, Cal.. Ang. 15.â Cass Colvin,
the Sequoia cutthroat, surrendered to
Deputy Sheriff Timmins and Constable
Ingels at 2 o'clock this morning and this
afternoon was incarcerated in the Connty
Jail in this city. Instead of trying to
make his way out of the hills into the
vailey, as was supposed, the murderer had
concealed himself under a log landing
within 300 yards of where he slew Totton
on Tuesday evening.
For three days and nights Colvin lay
hidden without food or water. He was
starved out of the place and last night
about 11 o'clock emerged with the purpose
of giving himself up to the officers. He
crawled to the cabin of a logger named
Mills and awoke him. Mills was afraid to
let the murderer in and asked him if he
still had the razor with which he cut tne
throat of his brother-in-law. Colvin re
plied that he had it with him. He agreed
to give it up to Mills and handed it to him
through a window. He was then let into
the cabin.
Mrs. Colvin and her babies were stop
ping in the Mills cabin, and the murderer
had a short talk with his wife. He then
asked Mills to take him to the officers, as
he desired to surrender himself. Coivin
was famished, and when given a drinK of
water his stomacti could not retain it.
Mills and the murderer made their way
ont of the loaeing camp as sieathily as
possible, for if an alarm had been raised
the loggers would have turned out and
hanged the cuiprit. Colvin was fully
aware of this. The two men walked to
the sawmills, nine miles distant, where
the two officers were stopping at a hotel,
having just returned from a search
through Sampson Flai tolhe Kings River.
Mills and the murderer walked into the
office|of the hotel and sent the proprietor up
to awaken the officers.
Tiie news that Colvin was at the hotel
quickly spread and the millhands, getting
u|> irom their beds, began to congregate,
although it was then 2 o'clock in the
mornin '. The officers took Colvin to
their room and quietly had their carriage
brought to the door of the hotel. Then
they rusned their prisoner downstairs into
the vehicle and the whip was laid to the
back of the horse. The officers believe
that if they had waited twenty minutes
longer a sufficient number of millhands
would have consregat<'d to carry out their
loud threats of lynching.
On the way down from the mountains
Colvin proved himself a veritable coward.
He placed his hands on the arm of each
officer and crouched down in front of
them in the carriage. When asted what
he was doinji that for the murderer said
that he was afraid the infuriated loggers
and millhands were pursuing him and
would shoot kirn. When Sanger was
reached Colvin assed if the news of his
surrender had been telephoned ahead.
W hen told that it had he expressed the
fear that the people of that place might
lynch him.
"No. they won't," saia Constable Ingels,
who has charge of the Sanger bailiwick,
"as long as I am with you."
"Well, I won't try to leave you," said
the prisoner, who was deathly pale.
After he had committed the murder on
Tuesday evening Colvin ran directly into
the woods and hid under the landing from
which the logs are loaded on to the cars.
Four hundred men were searching all
around him for two days, but the thought
never occurred to them that the cut
throat was under the landing. The offi
cers and the Coroner got off the cars,
which run from the mills to the logging
camp, on to the landing. The body of.
Colvin's victim was lying on the landing a
few feet above him for several hours before
it was put on to the car to be taken to the
mills.
The logging men were confident, when
Deputy Sheriff Timmins and Constable
Ingels arrived at camp, that the murderer
had gone into the Sampson Flat country,
because, they said, they had tracked him
in that direction for several miles.
When seen at the jail by a Call corre
spondent this evening Colvin refused to
make a statement. On the way down
from the mountains, however, Colvin
gave the officers an account of the manner
in which he cut the throat of his brother
in-law, which was substantially the same
as that given at the inquest. His own ad
missions are enough to hang him. The
prisoner appears to believe that the mur
der was justifiable. He says there are
other matters of which he will not tell un
til the trial.
WILL RETURN TO CARSON,
Brown, the Alleged Defaulter,
Ready to Answer in
Court.
Intends to Go Back and Stand Trial
on the Charges Filed
Against Him.
CARSON, Nev., Aug. 15.â The News
this evening contains the following re
garding the alleged bank defaulter:
Harry K. Brown will voluntarily return
to Carson in a few days. He has been
charged with taking from the Bullion and
Exchange Bank of this city various sums'
of money aggregating from $66,000 to $75,
--000 by various methods which are sup
posed to have extended over a period of
two years. It was given out that he had
been traced to Mexico and there lost sight
of. Various accounts of the matter have
been published in the San Francisco pa
pers, all of which were known here to be
far from correct on their face. The defal
cation is said to have been by reducing on
a stub the amount for which tDe check
was issued and by collecting bills receiva
ble without marking them collected on the
bank's books. Brown's absence- in the
eyes of the public verified tne accusations,
and no defense has ever been offered.
Now, however, Brown will return and
utand trial. During the last two or three
days of his stay in the bank he is charged
with tafcine something over $2000. It is
understood" that the defense will claim
that all amounts previous to that, which
he was charged with taking, were not the
result of a defalcation, but simpiy over
drafts, and that Brown was allowed to
overdraw by orders of the bank officials.
C. A. Jones departed for California last
evening, and it is understood that when
Brown returns he will accompany him.

DALY'S OGDEN
WON WALKING,
The Futurity Stakes Cap!
tured for the Copper
King.
BROKE THE RACE RECORD
He Was Piloted to Victory by
Doc Tuberville, a Local
Rider.
ORNAMENT FINISHED SECOND.
Six to One Quoted Against the Win
ning Horss and His Stable
Companion.
SHEEPSHEAD BAY RACETRACK,
N. V., Aug 15. â The ninth renewal of the
Futurity stakes, the richest event on the
American turf, was won this afternoon by
Marcus Daly's English bred colt Ogden,
by Kilwarlin-Oriole. The winner led from
the quarter-mile post and won easily by a
length and a half from the favorite, C. T.
Patterson Company's Ornament, who de
feated J. \V. Rogers' Rodermond by a
scant half length for the place. Ogden
covered the distance in 1:10, which makes
a new Futurity record, the best previous
time having been 1 :11, made by The But
terflies in 1894. Tuberville, the Western
jockey, who rode Ogden, made his debut
in the East in this race.
Not more than 10.000 people visited the
track by tbe sea, where a cool and steady
breeze furnished a refreshing contrast to
the heat of the city. The lawn was look
ing its brightest and greenest after the re
cent heavy rain and the grand stand, al
though showing a great many spare seats,
held a fashionable throng, whose presence
lent an air of gayety and animation to the
scene.
Of course nearly all the interest centered
iv the big event, but the third race, the
fall handicap for three-year-olds, came in
for a full share of attention. Gotham
won by a scant length from Hanweli, a 12
to 1 shot, with Buck Massie third, a neck
in front of Rubicon. Ben Brush was
fifth.
After the fourth race a general exodus
to the paddock wa3 made to view the
Futurity candidates. The general opin
ion was that they were a rather poor lot
of two-year-olds. Ornament came m for
the greatest share of attention, while
Rhodesia, Challenger and Marcus Daly's
pair, Ogden and Scottish Chieftain, were
not without friends.
In the ring, Ornament was installed
favorite, opening S to 5, but closing at 9
to 5 and 4to 5 the place. Rhodesia was
not in demand at 5 to 2,* and the post bet
ting was 13 to 5 and even. The Daly pair
was coupled at the close at 6 and 2. Chal
lenger coming next at 7 to 1 and 2 to 1,
while 15 and 6 was obtainable about Rod
ermond.

with Sims in the saddle came in for some
faint' applause in the preliminary canter.
Taral, who was on Scottish Chieltain, was
also noticed by the crowd, but Ogden and
Tuberville were allowed to pass without
comment. It was about 5 minutes after
5 o'clock when a shont from the grand
stand announced that the flag had fallen.
Ornament had slightly the best of a rather
straggling start, with Rodermond second,
Rhodesia third, and Bastion, Ogden, Scot
tish Chieftain, Box, Challenger, News
gatherer and Fan mure in the order named.
After the rirst furlong or so the copper,
silver and green flashed in the van as Tu
berville brought Ogden to the front and
led Rhodesia by a head, while the favorite
dropjjed behind Rodermond. who was
lying third. Tins was the order at the
Quarter-mile post.
' As they swept tip to the three-eighths
pole the Western jockey let out a link and
Sloan brought Ornament up within half a
length of the leader, while Rhodesia took
third place from Rodermond, Taral on
Scottish Chieftain lying close up, fourth.
At the half there was no relative change
in the positions of the two leaders, but
Rodermond again wrested t bird place from
Rhodesia, at whom Sims began to work.
Despite all his efforts the white and blue
colors were beaten and passad by Scottish
Chieftain.
A furlong further Ogden increased his
lead a trifle over Ornament and now Jed by
three-quarters of a length, while tbe favor
ite was a length and a half in front of
Rodermond, with Scottish Chieftain and
Rhodesia beaten off. Coming; down the
stretch in the last furlong Sloan got at his
mount with whip and spur, as also did
Hill on Rodermond, but they could not
gain an inch on Ogden, on whom the West
ern rider was sitting still.
The son of Kilwarlin and Oriole in
creased his lead in the last sixteenth and
passed the judges a length and a half in
front of Ornament, with Rodermond
third. The small Western contingent
which had come to see TuDerviiie ride
nearly went wild with excitement. They
threw their hats and sticks in the air and
yelled themselves hoarse in front of the
|udges' stand.
TuDerville's face fairly beamed with
Â«miles as he was lifted into the customary
floral chair and waived his green cap in
response to the cheers which greeted him.
The value of the stake was $57,290,
Â£47,290 of which goes to the winner, $3606
to the second hor.-e and $1833 to the third.
The remainder is divided between the
breeders of first, second and third horses.

CLOSE OF WILLOWS' MEETING
n. Wood, Athorit and Warrago Win on
the Last Day.
WILLOWS, Cal., Aug. 15.â The closing
lay of the race meeting was a great suc
cess. The inhabitants of Willows and the
mrrounding country turned out in force,
md the capacity of the grand stand was
.axed to its utmost. Glenn County's pretty
firls occupied the front seats in tbe grand
itand, absorbing almost as much attention
rom the male portion of the crowd as did
Auctioneer Dave Eiseman, who constantly
cept at the bettors to loosen their purse
itrings. B. H. Mooney, ex-secretary of
,he association, now a resident o f Yina,
headed a delegation from that town that
came over to make a "killing," but Mr.
Mooney had his friends down wrong in
the opening event, and they will go home
satisfied with picking grapes. The fair
was the greatest in tbe history of the
county seat of Glenn County, and Willows
will put in a big bid for public favor next
year.
The principal event on the card to-day
was the free-for-all- pace with W. Wood
(2:07), Bavwood (2:10^), Allie Cresco and
Promise Me as starters. Wood was a $10
to $5 choice over the neld and downed the
othera in straight heats, pacing over the
course in 2:17, 2:11 and 2:13. At the con
clusion of the first heat Starting Judge
McNair announced the time with a voice
of disgust, which had a most invigorating
effect, aa the tim<! of the second heat will
indicate. Bavwood showed by his mode
of traveling that he would improve as the
season progresses.
The special 2:27 trot broneht out a field
of six starters. Backers of the favorites
were certainly worthy of the sympathy of
their neighbors in this race. Lena Holly
sold favorite at $10, with Duse driven by
"Sandy" Smith, the great rater, next in
demand at $4 and the Held bringing $4.
Tbe two choices met with disaster in tbe
first heat, both having the much-dreaded
piece of red satin waved before them.
The field-players settled back in their
seats with a feeling of perfect comfort
and saw Driver Clarke pilot Athovis. a
son of Clovis, across the line in three
straight heats in 2:18^â2:23^â2:22.
Fandana, a "corking good" three-year-old
by Eros, who has only been in training
for a period of sixty days, gained second
money and the admiration of the crowd
by his honest efforts in each heat trotted.
The mile and a furlong handicap, with
six facing the flag, proved a rattling bet
ting affair. Warrago, carrying 107 pounds,
at first sold favorite, but as the post time
drew nigh, Seaside occupied the place of
honor, Warrago, Nevere and the field sell
ing in the order mentioned. Starter Mc-
Nair, whose work has given great satisfac
tion throughout tbe meeting, sent the

field away in perfect alignment. Passing
the stand, Severe, Faro and Seaside
showed the way. The lighfc-weighter,
Juan Bernard, showed the way down the
back stretch and into the straight for
home, with Nevere a; his heels. Straight
ened away for the final issue, it simmered
to a struggle between Warrajo and Sea
side. By good riding young Cleveland
won, the former mare" getting home
first by a neck, in I:SGJ^. with Nevere
gaining show honors by a nose from Clara
Johnson.

CAUGHT NEAR SANGER.
Outlaw "Jim" Haslip Run to
Earth by Constable
Irvine.
End ct a Two Years' Pursuit in
Which a Score of Officers
Participated.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 15.â "Jim" Haslip,
the Indian who murdered an Italian near
Raymond over two years ago, was cap
tured to-day by Constable John Irvine of
Sanger at a rancheria on tbe San Joaquin
River in the mountains. Haslip has for
two years dodged the officers, who have
made a number of attempts to catch him.
The particulars of the capture are meager.
Sheriff Scott has gone to Belleview, in
Madera County, to meet the Constable and
the prisoner and bring Haslip to Fresno.
Irvine went to the mountains on horse
back and had no way of bringing the
prisoner down.
Haslip's murder of the inoffensive
Italian near Raymond was a cowardly one.
The Italian was conducting a vegetable
garden and the Indian murdered him for
the purpose ox robbery. The murderer
fled across the San Joaquin to the moun
tains of Fresno County where he has since
been spending his time in concealment at
different rancherias.
Tbe Indians were all afraid of him and
dared not refuse him food and shelter or
inform the officers regarding his where
abouts. Sheriff Westfall of Madera made
three or four trips after him without suc
cess. The Sheriff once visited a cabin
where Haslip was hidden under a pile of
rags at the time with a revolver in each
band ready to shoot if discovered.
Constable Irvine was successful in his
third attempt to catch the fugitive. On
the second trip, when he was accompanied
by Hi Rapelje, the murderer escaped on a
horss from a rancheria when the officers
were approaching only 300 yards distent.
They hunted for three days among the
surrounding hills, but could not catch
him.
The Constable was determined to cap
ture the Indian, and four days ago he set
out a alone >: < for z the mountains, having
learned 1^ of Haslip's whereabouts. He
went quietly, so that the murderer would
not learn that he was coming, and it :is
supposed that ;he ; took J Haslip \ by "i sur
prise. - â  ;â â  Â
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16. 1896.
MILLER A SANTA
BARBARA CAPTIVE
The Ex-Butler in Jail for
Abducting a Young
Girl.
TELLS A aUEER STORY.
Attacks Captain Lees and His
Former Employer in San
Francisco.
CAUSE OF HIS DISCHARGE.
His Killing of the Supposed Burglar
and the Events That
Fo'lowed.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 15.â
Santa Barbara has for the past twenty
four hours been entertaining a prisoner of
greater importance than she knew. A
couple of days ago a telegram was received
from the Chief of Police of Los Angeles,
asking for the arrest of a man named Frank
Miller, who had left town and who bad
abducted a 14-year-old girl named Hattie
Auber. The couple were found at the "Do
Drop In," on Lower State street, the most
disreputable resort in the city, and placed
under arrest. It was ascertained that the
man bad brought the girl to Santa Barbara
with the intention of having her lead a
life of shame.
The girl confessed this herself airily, with
apparently no idea that there was any
disgrace in her position, but rather pleased
with the sudden and unenviable notoriety
which she has won.
The man now proves to be Frank Miller,
the San Francisco butler, formerly in the
j employ of J. L. Franklin, and who gained
I such celebrity some months ago by killing
I a burglar in the house of his employer. It
was charged that he enticed a stranger to
the honse and killed him, simply to win
fame for himself, but this the San Fran
cisco police could not prove.
Miller was seen to-day in the County
Jail by a Call correspondent. He is bÂ«
ing held under $2500 bonds awaiting trial
on the charge of abduction. He stated
that when he left Â£an Francisco he went
to Elsinore, where he was employed as a
porter in the Lake View Hotel. Afterward
he went to Los Angeles, where he was em
ployed as a waiter in various restaurants.
Miller stated that although he had a dis
agreement with Mr. Franklin which led to
his leaving the latter's ttervice, he was
still on good terms with his former em
ployer and was sure that Mr. Franklin
would vouch for his good habits and
character. He accounted ibr Franklin's
acceptance ot the theory advanced by
Captain Lees and which supposes the man
who was shot to have been inveigled into
the house by Miller, on the grounds that
Mr. Franklin was, as he alleges, the agent
of the Louisana Lottery Company in San
Francisco, conducting an illicit enterprise
under the guise of a general brokerage and
loan agency, and that it was necessary for
him in this business to keep "solid" with
Lees, which caused him to ultimately in
dorse Lees' views in this case.
Miller looks pale and haggard, and al
though he keeps up a bold front, declaring
that tbe present charge against him will
be easily met, he evidently realizes the
seriousness of his position.
Hattie Auber, the 14-year-old girl, wel
comed the advent of a newspaper repre
sentative as an agreeable break in the
monotony of jail life. She is a slight, fair
girl, with a bright and rathsr pretty face.
She talks with perfect freedom and un
concern of the life to which the young
man introduced her, and seems to have
not the slightest idea that it involves any
disrepute unless among a class of "nar
row, straight-laced people," unacquainted
with the way of the world.
When asked as to whether Miller bad
told her anything concerning tbe killing
of the burglar in the Franklin house Hat
tie said that Miller nad told her something
about it, reflecting great credit upon him
self, and had also showed her a clipping
he had in his trunk, which described the
killing as an act of heroism. She cad
heard that there was another side to the
story, and, girl-like, was very curious to
hear it, but when the main points of the
story now told that Miller had decoyed
the burglar to the house for the purpose of
murdering him and covering himself with
glory in the eyes of the Franklins were re
lated to her, she declared that it was
awful, and that she could not believe he
would do such a dreadful thing.
"It would take a lot of nerve to do that,' '
she commented.
"And does Frank Miller lack the neces
sary nerve?" was asked.
"Oh, no,'' she replied quickly. "You
bet 'he's got nerve." â¢,
She said that; Miller carried quite a
voluminous correspondence in his trunk,
most of his correspondents being women.
STOCK TO COM ING FETE.
Carnival Funds to BÂ« Augmented by
l*roe*edi From a Ball Game.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 15.â The gen
eral committees of the Native Sons met
to-night, and Chairman Grunsky of the
committee in charge of the pavilion deco
rations filed his report. The contract for
draping the big structure with streamers
and bunting has been let to a San Fran
cisco firm. Red and white, blue and gold
will be the colors that will predominate.
It was decided to-night to appoint another
committee to canvass the city for funds, as
it is desired to raise another $1000 for the
carnival. The new committee will start
out on Monday to see how much money it
can raise.
To-morrow the representatives of the
Evening Mail and Morning Independent
will play a game of baseball at Goodwater
Grove, for the benefit of the carnival fund.
SAN BERNARDINO SPOKEN
Tall Bitildlnps Swayed by a Sharp
Earthquake Shock.
SAN BERNARDINO. Cal., Aug. 15.-
This region was jarred by a severe earth
quake shock at 3 o'clock fVli morning. It
lasted only a fraction of a second. The'
occupants of the taller buildings report
that the structures creaked and swayed in
an alarming manner. A citizen who came
in from tbe mountains this morning says
the shock was followed by a tremendous
roar and that the undulation of the earth
caused the tall pines to sway to and fro.
No damage has been reported, either in
city or country.
Xioat in Death Valley.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Aug. 15.â
It is believed that Charles White, an old
and well-known miner of this county, has
perished in or near Death Valley. On the
2d of this month he separated hinvelf
from a party of prospectors from the Gqler
district and went off on an investigating
trip. He agreed to return in three days.
Nothing has since been heard of him, and
it is believed that he perished from thirst
and heat.
DOUGLAS AT LOS ANGELES
Lord Sholto Returns From the
Cactns-Garbsd Plains of
Arizona.
Has Given Up tbe Idea of a iooo-
Mile Ride on a C*y use's
Back.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 15.â Lord
Sbolto i)ougla3 has come out of the wilds
and wool of Arizona and once more
donned the garb of the effete. He arrived
in this city to-day after an eventful tour in
Arizona. His attempt at a 1000-mile ride
on the back of a cayuse was cot produc
tive either of dollars to my lord's ex
chequer or peace to his soul. In addition
to this Sbolto says that the climate of
Arizona was something terrible.
"Why, it was 120 degrees in the shade
in Phoenix," he said, "and I really could
not stand it any longer, so I left. I am
glad to get out of that country. We gave
up our tour because there was not enough
money in it, and also on account of the
heat. John E. Coker, the artist, who ac
companied me, is somewhere in Arizona.
I do not expect to return to that sun
kissed section of America. No, I am not
going north to visit my wife* relatives. I
am going to remain here in Los Angeles.
My wife will join me within the course of
a few days."
Lord Sholto looks bronzed and much
improved by his trip, although be cannot
be said to have taken on any amount of
flesh.
SEVEN YEARS IN FOLSON.
Cheek- Raiser Dole Denied a A'eiv Trial
and Sentenced.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 15.âAttor
ney E. J. Dole was sentenced to seven
years at Folsoni penitentiary by Judee
Smith this morning. Dole was convicted
reoently of raising a certified check for
$2 50 to $SoO and passing it at the State
Loan and Trust Company Bank in this
city. The defense based the greatest hopes
for a new trial upon the point that the
court erred in admitting testimony with
reference to a conversation bad by the de
fendant with Detective Bradish, after he
had arrested Dole at San Francisco. Tbe
defense contended that the cross-examina
tion was irregular and not warranted, be
cause they had asked tbe defendant noth
ing about tbe conversation with Bradish.
As to the other points relied upon, affi
davits to show an alibi, the court held that
the new testimony sought to be made the
basis for a new trial was cumulative, as
tbe defense had gone thoroughly into the
matter of an alibi at the trial, and that
taken in connection with the testimony at
the trial was not sufficient to authorize a
new trial. The motion for a new trial was
therefore denied, as well as a motion in
arrest of judgment, and the court asked
the defendant if he had any choice as to
which prison he would prefer. Dole re
plied in the negative and was sentenced
to Folsom. Notice of appeal wa| given
and a stay of execution granted for thirty
days within which to prepare a bill of ex
ceptions.
GUARDIAN GIFES A BLESSING.
Opposition to a Jtomantie Wedding at
Sea Withdrawn.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 15.â There
is now no longer any barrier to tbe peace
ful union of George E. Cross and Josephine
Rowland. The two were married at Santa
Monica last Sunday. The groom is 22
years old and the bride 15. The guardian

"GUILTY" IS THE
SONORA VERDICT
J. T. Newcomer Convicted
of Second â¢ Degree
Murder.
JURY OUT TEN HOURS.
The Aged Prisoner Displays No
Emotion When the Result
Is Announced.
SONORA, Cal., Aug. 15.â John \ New
comer, the slayer of his aged mining part
ner. Colonel Caleb Dorsey, was to-day
found guilty of murder in the second de
gree. The jury was out ten hours before
the verdict waa reached. Byron Waters,
the attorney for Newcomer, will move for
a new trial on Monday.
In his closing argument this morning
District Attorney Otis reviewed the testi
mony in an exhaustive manner and
pointed out to the jury the weak spots in
the defendant's plea of justification or
self-defense. From the trend of the Dis
trict Attorney's remarks it was evident
that he did not expect a verdict of murder
in the first degree, and he cave the jury
practically to understand that his side
would be satisfied with a verdict of man
slaughter.
Otis closed his speech by assuring the
jury that all he wished was justice, and
whatever the verdict he would know that
in rendering it every member of the jury
was actuated by conscientious motives.
Judee Nicol at 11:30 o'clock commenced
his instructions to the jury, taking a half
hour in the delivery. The jury retired,
and did not arrive at an agreement until 9
o'clock. The aged defendant gave no out
ward sign of emotion when the verdict
was read.

Auditor Broderick's Demand
for the Uncollected
Taxes.

Suit by the District
Attorney.
TOTAL ASSESSED VALUATION.
The Auditor's Corrections Made and a
Report Rendered to the State

Assessor Siebe's annual ordeal, the time
when he must turn into the treasury the
sum he has failed to collect in taxes on
personal property or stand a prosecution
at the bamis of the District Attorney, iÂ» at
hand, and was heralded yesterday by a
sharp demand from Auditor Broderick
that the law be complied with. Mr.
Broderick's letter was as follows:
Hon. John D. Siebe, Assessor of the City and
County of San Franciscoâ Sin : Pursuant to the
provisions of section 3831 of the Political
Code of California, I have the honor to inform
you that as Auditor of the City and County of
San Francisco, I have, subsequent to the first
Monday in August, 1896, made a careful ex
amination of the assessment books of the City
and County ol San Francisco, to ascertain
therefrom the amounts of all taxes that should
have been collected by the Assessor in pursu
ance of the statutes of 1895, chapter CCXVIII
of the Polidcal Code, and which have not
been collected.
1 have determined that the amount of taxes
that should have been collected and have not
been collected by you amounts to the sum of
$138,299 93, as per my account to the As
sessor, accompanying this demand. I, there
fore, by this letier, demand that you, as
Assessor ci the City and County of San Frau
ciseo, do pay into the treasury of the City and
County of San Francisco, witnin fifteen days
from date hereof, the said sum of $138,299 93,
said sum being the amount of taxes so remain
ing uncotlected by you, as hereinbefore stated.
Very respectfully, William Broderick,
Auditor of the City and County of San Fran
cisco.
Accompanying the letter was a state
ment making the following showing:
Total value of personal property r011.. 533,174,9 80
Amount on which taxes have been col
lected 27,028.316
Amount on which Assessor failed to
collect 86,146.664
Amount ol tax uncollected by the Assessor,
f 138,299 93.
The law requires that the Auditor must
make this demand on the Assessor, and
tliat the District Attorney, in c?se of fail
ure to comply with it. must begin proceed
ings at once.
Assessor Siebe won his case when tried
last year for a failure to turn $40,180 13 un
collected taxes into the treasury, Judge
Trout deciding in his favor on the ground
that portions of the law were unconstitu
tional. The large amount of the taxes
classed as uncollected are on the cash in
the vaults of the banks that have had in
junctions served on the Assessor prohibit
ing him from collecting them. Deducting
these from the $138,299 33 demanded, it
appears that the Assessor collected nearer
to the tola! amount due than last year.
Assessor Siebe declines to say what he
will do in the matter until he has looked
closely into the law.
F. D. Burrows, the Auditor's account
ant, finished the arduous task of correct
ing the clerical and other errors in the
Assessor's books yesterday and prepared
the annual statement to the State Con
troller, to be used at the meeting of the
State Board of Equalization at Sacramento
on Wednesday next.
The revised figures show that the entire
amount of taxable property is $357,586,126,
or $29,780,979 more "than last year.
The complete figures for the past two
years are as follows:
Value of real estate other than city
and town lots. $2,848,170
Value of city and town lots 1*3,879,210
Total value of real estate $186,827,380
Value of Improvements on real estate
other than city ana town lots $715,550
Improvements on city and town lots. 87,751,361
Total value of improvements $88,506,915
Total value of real es
tate, lots and ita- 1896. 1896.

Value of money and
solvent credits. 17,122,486 85,178,734
Totals $327,806,147 $357,586,126
The number of acres of land assessed is
the same as last year, 27,200, while the
amount of mortgages on property has in
creased from $49,684,914 in 1895 to $51,013,
--275 in the present year.
The lar^e increase in the assessed value
of money and solvent credits ia due to the
action of the Assessor in taxing the cash in
the various banks amounting to several
millions.
The question of who shall represent the
City before the State Board of Equaliza
tion has not yet been settled, bat tne
probabilities are that Auditor Broderick
and Assessor Siebe will be the ones on
whom the duty will fall. Auditor Brod
erick said yesterday that if the State Board
makes a horizontal raise on the total
valuation of city property it will do so on
the showing that the taxes on over $6,
--000,000 of personal property have not been
collected and that the valuation presented
to them is fictitious.
"This will be an injustice to the City if
it is done," said Mr. Broderick, "because,
while five banks have not paid the taxes
on the coin in their vaults! I believe that
they will yet be compelled to do so, and
that in consequence the total of the uncol
lected taxes will be less than last year.
"The State Board probably figures that
unless it raises the total valuation the
State will not get its full proportion of
taxes from this City, but in view of the
fact that leaving out the amount on which
taxes have not been collected the assessed
valuation is many millions greater than
last year, I do not see what the State
Equalizers have to fear. A determined
fight will certainly be made to keep the
board from making a raise."
"DOLLIE IN TOWN."
Her Brother Declares That She Knows
Absolutely Nothing of the TViu
throp Case.
In the interval before the Winthrop-
Campbell abduction case comes to trial
detectives are at work following up clears.
The latest development discloses the fact
that the alleged "mysterious Doliie" is in
town.
Elmer E. Parmeiee of 3508 Twenty
fourth Btreet said yesterday: "My sister
was in no way connected with this abduc
tion of Mr. Campbell, and abe has never
written a letter to O. W. WinthroD.

ploy on July 30, and has since been living
home assisting her mother. She has never
been out of the house except on busi
ness, accompanied by her mother or some
member of the family. As she left her
employer on July 30, she had nothing to
do with the shortage of wages due August

has since been in the City.
"Captain Lees told me positively that

DESERTED AND POOR.
Pitiable Condition ot a Little Child and
Its Twice Married Young
Mother.
Mrs. Maggie Murray, s young woman
whose childhood was passed at the Roman
Catholic orphan asylum in this City, told
a pathetic story at the office of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
yesterday. On leaving the care of the
sisters she went out to service as a domes
tic, after some years accepting a situation
in Stockton, where she met Murray. The
man fascinated her, and the inexperienced
girl expressed her willingness to become
his wife.
Murray took her to an office where the
marriage ceremony was read by a man
representing himself to be a clergyman in
tbe presence of another individual who
called himself the County Clerk. Thia
happened in 1898, and in the following
year a little girl was born. Four months
later the young woman discovered the in
validity of her supposed marriage.
Shortly afterward the couple came to
this City ar^d Mrs. Murray prevailed upon
her deceiver to have the marriage revali
dated by Justice Barry.
Legitimate matrimonial bliss seemed to
t>all upon Murray, and a short time ago
he decamped. But he did not go alone.
A fair but frail companion cheered his
fli hit and resided with him for some time
in San Jose. The pair separated in a short
time, and the last news of Murray re
ported him as living in Stockton with a
giddy young creature of questionable ante
cedents. Meanwhile his wife and child
have been enduring the severest ardships
and privations. The officers of Ihe society
are endeavoring to make Murray do some
thing to alleviate the sad condition of the
little one and its mother.
A FAST BICYCLE - BOAT,
Will Advance Aquaticsâ ls Pro
pelled With Little Exer
tion.
A Trial Trip to Be Made Across the
Bay Shortly With Copies of a
Local Paper.
Colin Thompson of this City has in
vented a water bicycle which he claims
will completely revolutionize the method
of propelling vessels through the water by
the aid of human power.
A great number of water bicycles have
been invented, but the exertion required
to propel them through tbe water was
always too great to allow of them being
put into practical use.
Mr. Thompson claims to have overcome
this difficulty, and with his water cycle
expects to easily defeat any of the ferry
boats on the bay, using no more power
than it takes to run an ordinary bicycle on
a good road.
This is due to the machinery of the craft,
which is composed of a succession of small
cogwheels with ball bearings, working one
upon the other from a power developed
by pedaling.
"The rider sits a little above tbe gunwale
of the boat on a regulation bicycle seat
Colin Thompson's Water Bicyole, the W. J. Bryan, on Which He Expeots to
Make 18 Knots an Hour.
and every turn of the pedals causes six
teen revolutions of the propeller, which is
situated almost below the center of the
boat and attached to a steel shaft that is
in turn connected with the pedals by
means of a small wheel.
The boat itself is a very primitive-look
in- strucure and resembles a fin-keel
yacht. It is double-ended, and fitted with
air-tight compartments at each end, mak
ing it practically unsinkable.
An open space is left in the center for
the machinery, and the boat is so divided
that it resembles two boats in one, or one
boat above the water and one below it.
The boat that appears on the surface only
draws six inches of water and is twelve
feet long, while the part below the water,
that sustains the machinery and rider, is
only four feet long and draws sixteen
inches of water.
Tbe entire craft is decked over, leaving
an open space in the center for the rider.
It is 3 feet wide at the center and 22 inches
deep, with only 6 inches of the boat ap
pearing above the water. It is fitted with

FOR MURDER
AND ARSON,
Fiendish Chinese Plot Un
earthed by the Fire
Marshal.
A FACTOEY IN DANGEB.
A High Price Placed Upon the
Head of Chun Man, the
Owner.
TWO ATTEMPTS THAT FAILED.
Oil, Matches and a Lighted Fuse
Placed in a SansomoStreet
Building.
An attempt was made on Thursday
night or early Friday to destroy the large
overall factory on Washington and San
some streets by fire. The attempt only
miscarried by an accident or perhaps
ignorance on the part of the person who
laid the train. The factory is owned and
run by a Chinese by the name of Chuu
Man, who employs abont twenty-five of
his countrymen in the manufacture of
overalls.
Man lives in the npper part of the fac
tory, and when he arose early Friday
morning he found in his hallway at 509^
Washington street a curiously constructed
contrivance, the purpose ol which was
apparent at a glance.
It consisted of a quart bottle partly filled
with coal oil. The cork was slit open on
one side and into this was punched two
punksticks or slow matches. At the
mouth of the bottle was attached a large
bunch of lucifer matches, bound on with
bamboo. The punks had been lighted and
it was the intention that the fire should
burn slowly to the bunch of matches,
which would ignite and set fire to the oil
tbat escaped from the slit in the cork.
The person who placed the deadly affair
there evidently did not know that the oil
running on the punk would extinguish the
live coal tbe same as water. That was
what happened wnen the punk became
soaked with coal oil, and consequently the
coal was not able to reach the bunch of
matches which would , have caused the
necessary flame.
But for this accident or oversight the
large factory with its valuable stock and
the machinery would no doubt have gone
up in smoke and flame.
The case was at once reported to Fire
Marshal Towe, who made an investiga
tion, and yesterday he learned of the
cause of the attempt to destroy the fac
tory. This attempt to commit arson re
veals still another trait in the nature of
tne lower order of coolies.
It seems that among the overalls and
other garment workers there is a Chinese
union, similar in its aims and objects to
the white - labor unions, although tbe
methods to effect desired -nds are radi
cally different. A year or two ago Chun
Man had trouble with his union workmen
and he hired a non-union crew for his fac-
Tory, and from that time to the present he
has vowed that he would not have any
thing more to do with Chinese union
workmen.
The latter were enraged at this course
and the union at once decided that Man
must die. More than that, a price of $1000
was set upon his bead and the assassin
who was to execute the death sentence
was picked out of the murderous crew.
Man learned of this, but being a person of
great courage he did not flee or shrink
from meeting his enemies. In fact he
armed himself and went into Chinatown
and with the greatest coolness walked
directly into the union's headquarters.
Seeing the man who had been selected as
his executioner he went over to him and
with a smile that meant mischief said :
"Well, here I am. Why don't you earn
your money? One thousand dollars does
not grow on bushes to be picked so easily
every day."
His personal courage cowed the fellow?
for the time and the assassin sneaked off
into another room. He simply waited for
his opportunity, as he did not have any
idea of risking a personal encounter with
an individual as Man. The latter, how
ever, reported the case to the Chinese Six
Companies. This body, too, found that
$1000 had been offered for Man's life, and
the edict went fortn that the assassin
must leave the country at once. He went
to China on the next steamer and was
only too glad to keep his own hide whole.-
The union workmen were not to be
thwarted so easily, and the $1000 was then
offered to the man who would destroy
Man's factory by fire.
It was decided, however, not to make a
move in this direction too quickly, but to
wait until the excitement of the first
trouble blew over. Man recently learned
that the union men were likely to renew
hostilities and he kept a lookout for
trouble. He was not careful enough, as
one of the ruffians succeeded in placing
the firebrand in the hall on Thursday
night as stated. The fellow knew. what he
waa doing for he put the bottle of oil in a
place where, had the plan succeeded, the
building could not have been spved.
Fire Marshal Towe does not propose to
let this matter drop, but will request the
Mayor to offer a reward of $250 lor the
arrest of the miscreant or any who are in
the plot. Under the lawjthe Mayor may
off^r such a reward for the arrest o: pe"r
sons who conspire or execute such plots.
The Queen's Whaling Excursion.
It is announced that the Queen, in addi
tion to the whaling feature of the cruise
(sailing next Saturday afternoon) will also
visit the wiecked steamers St. Paul and
Colombia. The trip is such a novel one
that everybody seems determined to go.
Justice Carroll on the Police Bench.
Justice of the Peace John A. Carroll's
severe judicial brow will make the offend
ers who appears in Judge Conlan's court
during the next week tremble. Judge
Conlan is on a vacation, and during his
absence the mantle of his authority -as
fallen on the popular young Justice.
CITY OF PARA ARRIVES.
Chief Steward Crosby and Charles
Smith Die on the Trip.
The Pacific STail Steamship Company's
steamer City ot Paraairived from Panama
and way ports last evening. Her captain
reports that on the down trip Charles
Smith, a coal-passer, died- and was buried
off the coast of Mexico. On the return
trip Benjamin Crosby, chief steward, died
of heart disease and was buried in tbe
Gulf of Teh nun tepee.
The deceased was at one time second
steward on the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's steamer Columbia. He re
signed that position a number of years
ago to take the position of first steward on
the Panama steamer San Jose. He was
finally transferred to the City of Para and
remained on her up to the time of his
death.
George Crosby was married a little
over a year ago and resided, when not on
duty, with his wife in Oakland.

A MISSION JUBILATION.
Family Gathering Celebrating
the High Scnool Vic
tory.
Resolutions Passed Thanking Those
Who Assisted in Making the
Residents H ppy.
Wnat might be termed a family gather
ing of the residents of the Mission assem
bled at Defense Hall, on Guerrero and
Twentieth streets, last night, to give vent
to their expression of joy on having re
ceived $200,000 from tne Supervisors, with
which a high school will be erected in tbe
sunbelt valley for the accommodation of
the school children of the district.
The meeting was called to order by J. F.
Crosette, who stated tbe object of their
coming together to be for congratulation
and to return thanks to those who so ably
assisted and responded to the necessity of
having a high school in their immediate
home.
By a unanimous vote J. D. Phelan was
elected chairman of the meeting, and be
in turn spoke of the beneiiis to the resi
dents of the Mission in their having a
school where their children could finish
their educa tion without being compelled
to travel to the other side of the City.
He said that 6 mills taxation on the dol
-1 ar was not too much for the people of
this City to give to the wants of the peo
ple of the Mission district for educational
purposes.
So iar as he was concerned he would
contribute liberally his pro rata of taxes to
educational purposes, and he was sure
tbat all other taxpayers would be as gen
erous when they knew that the money
thus given was put to laudable use.
John H. Grady, president of the Mis
sion High School Club, followed, giving
a resume of the labors of the club and the
results achieve! thus far.
Judge F. W. Van lleynegom offered the
following preamble and resolutions, which
were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, The Board of Education of the
City and County of San Francisco recom
mended to ihe Board of Supervisors the neces
sity of establishing a high school in the Mis
sion district and asked the appropriation of
$200,000 for the purpose of acquiring a site
and erecting a building. Aud whereas, the
finance committee oi the Board of Supervisors
in Us ruport states thai "as many of our de
partments and citizens have impressed the
committee with th<>ir views on many public
requirements it is but just to state that, but
for the conditions existing, these requirements
would have been provided for," and they
add, emphasizing our petition, that
"among the many, none appeal to
your committee more strongly than the
appropriation asked for a high school
at the M ssion"; and, whereas, the citizens of
the Mission district are unanimous in request
ing that such facilities be given their children ;
and, whereas, the Boys' High School ana the
Girl^' High School, overcrowded and inade
quate, are located in parts of the City remote
from the Mission, where dwell almost one
third of the children who attend the public
schools, and, whereas, the distance imposes an
additional and unnecessary tax upon said
children who desire the high school education
amounting in the carfare alone to the per
capita allowance for each child under the
school levy, anci.whereas, the people of the Mis
sion are not oblivious to the necessity of keep
ing down taxation in a season of financial and
business depression through which we are
passing, yet a high school is a permanent addi
tion to the City's property, yielding for the out
lay educated men and women to grow up to
serve the community in which they are edu
cated: and, whereas, the demand for such
facilities is real and urgent as made by the
Board of Education having the matter in
charge and petitioned for by the families
whose children suffer by reason of the absence
of such facilities; and, whereas, it is only just
and proper that the Board of Supervisors
should have harkened to the voice of the
people immediatelyr interested in granting
their reasonable request, and no taxpayer will
begrudge the payment of G mills on the
dollar of valuation for such a noble and neces
sary purpose, especially when the district
affected has contributed by taxation in the
past and present vast sums to the City's
treasury without any adequate return for
schools and none for parks ; be it therefore
Resolved, That the thanks of this meeting be
cordially extended to the Board of Education,
and more particularly to the Board of Super
visors, for having voted the necessary funds
for providing the Mission with school faci.i
tieÂ« lor its children, and that we especially
thank our representative, J. K. C. Hobbs, for
responding so enthusiastically to our call; and
be it further
Resolved, That we assure the citizens of San
Francisco that with this Improvement tardy
justice will at last have been done to an his
toric and thickly settled portion of the City,
which has been forced to yield, by previous
Boards of Supervisors, to the necessities
of the new and growing Western Ad
dition, which is now well eg lipped
with schoolhouses; that "when the case is
proved and the. hour has come justice delayed
is justice denied" ; that the growth and devel
opment of one part of the City is the benefit of
all, and that no money can be so well spent by
the municipality as for the educational wel
fare of the children of the City, which inures
ultimately to cood government, good citizen
ship and good morals.
School Director Henderson stated that
the architect had been instructed to pre
pare plans for the building. He thought
a suitable site could be obtained for
$60,000, leaving $140,000, with which an
elegant building could he erected, and if
everything went along smoothly the
school would be finished in one year from
tbe present date.
Julius Kahn, who was present, was
called upon for a few remarks. He said it
was better to give $6 for educational pur
poses than $1 for the support of a penal
institution.
Police Judge Low, who had recently
taken up his residence in the favored belt,
spoke of the loveliness of the climate and
the hope that in the near future they
would have a public park where the ladies
and the babies could spend the days and
the evenings free from fog and cold winds.
The meeting adjourned with three rous
ing cheers for the Mission High School
Club and the committee that brought such
crowning success to the people.

ANOTHER PAPER
HAS BEEN LOST
Inventory and Appraise
ment of the Joshna
Hendy Estate
MISSING FOR MONTHS
Disappearance of a Document of
Great Importance to Con
testants.
_____ â¢
ATTORNEY LANGHORNE ANGRY
How an Apparently Prosperous Busi
ness Loses Instead of Mak
irg Money.
There is another important paper miss
ing from the County Clerk's office. This
time it is an inventory and appraisement
of the estate of Joshua Hendy. The loss,
however, is not an irreparable one, as a
copy of the missing document, which is
very full and reliable, is in existence. The
fact that the inventory of the Hendy es
tate was missing has been known to the
attaches of the Probate Department of the
Clerk's office for some time, some say as
long as three months. Attorney J. P.
Langhorne, the legal representative of one
oi the contestants, has also been aware of
the loss for quite a while.
The litigation over the Hendy property
has been in tbe courts for a couple of
years. Recently it has been charged that
the executors of the will of Joshua Hendy
are running things in such a manner that
in the course of a short time the entire es
tate will disappear.
Samuel J. Hendy and John Hendy,
nephews of tbe deceased, are acting as
executors. While the business is ap
parently a profitable one, it has been the
custom of the executors to borrow large
sums from the estate to put into it. Con
sequently a petition for their removal was
riled by Mrs. Josephine Green, a sister of
the executors and one of the heirs.
Mrs. Green was ax one time the favorite
niece of Jushua Hendy. She, however,
married in opposition to her uncle's
wishes, ana in bis will he cut her off with
$5000 out of a $500,000 estate. She subse
quently began a contest, and the other
heirs compromised by allowing her $20,000.
Not long ago the executors petitioned for
an order for the partial distribution of the
estate and filed a report of the property
in their charge. It was this report that
led to the upheaval regarding the missing
inventory.
J. P. Langhorne, who is Mrs. Green's
attorney, noticed that there was a dis
crepancy between the inventory and the
report fiied by the executors in the peti
tion for distribution, and as the estate
consists principally of tne stock of the
Joshua Hendy Machine Works he deter
mined to investigate. He accordingly
sent one of his clerks to copy the original
inventory that he might compare it with
a copy be had in bis possession. The
original document was a bulky affair in
book form, but when the clerk looked for
it he found it missing. Search wa* at once
instituted and the clerk's office has been
ransacked from end to end, but without
result.
Yesterday, angered at the non-appear
ance of the paper, Mr. Langhorne deter
mined to keep the matter secret no longer.
He says that he does not wish to maKe
any charges against anybody, but that the
mfpsing inventory is material to his case
and that he intends to get bold of it if it
be possible, no matter who is hart in the
transaction.
The deputies in the County Clerk's
office made another search yesterday, but

JAPANESE LABOR IS A MENACE TO WORKINGMEN.
In connection with the threatened in- J
vasion of Japanese goods, which are j
likely to inundate this country at no very ,
distant day, it is often urged that the j
Orient will be able to consume the total
Japanese output for some years to come, j
Those who make that statement have not i
deeply studied the character of the people j
ofthe Orient, the copulation supposed to j
be able to consume what the Japanese
manufacture.
Any person interested in ascertaining
the probable outcome of the question, par
ticularly in learning where the Japanese- j
made goods are likely to be sold, should j
Btudy the habits of life of the Orientals.
It will be seen at a glance that the pecu
liar forms of house decoration prevalent
in America would be out of place in the
Orient, where many articles common here
are wholly unknown. Take furniture as
one striking example. In a land where
beds and like pieces of furniture are un
known it is evident that the consumption i
of bedroom furniture would be nothing.
Obeying the general laws of trade the j
Japanese will rule the best marKet, which ;
means the surest and best price. In the i
United States the demand for the count- j
less utensils of an advanced civilization
will be large and the Orientals will sell
their wares at a figure sufficiently under
the home price to guarantee them the
business. The consumptive power of
under-paid and semi-civilized Orientals
beyond Japan is sure to be small com- !
pared with that of the progressive nations !
of Europe and the West. Here the people j
have for many generations lived in com- !
parative luxury, embracing in the cata- j
logue of necessaries countless objects of j
use and beauty, bnt in the greater part of !
the Orient people's tastes are the most â 
frugal.
A careful study of the census tables of !
this country and the great nations of i
Europe shows that, out of every thousand i

SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 16.â The Fifth
Congressional District Convention of the
People's party was held in G. A. R. Hal l
this afternoon, and nominated James
Taylor Ropers of San Francisco for Con
gress. J. R. Welch, chairman of the dis
trict committee, called the convention to
order.
"The nomination of a Congressman
was postponed by this district con
vention until this time," said the
chairman, "in order to allow the politi
cal skies to clear a little before plac- |
ing a candidate for Congress from this !
district in nomination. At the time of
the first meeting of the district conven
tion in Sacramento, simultaneous with
the State convention in Sacramento last
May, the political situation was very com
plicated. Now it has cleared, and it is, I
think, apparent to you that our postpone
ment of action was wise. Notwithstand
ing the fact that the Populists were about
to nominate W. J. Bryan, the Democratic i
nominee for President, in St. Louis, and it
was apparent that the interests of the
Democratic and Populist parties would ,
lay along about the same lines, both
Nationally and locally, in the coming
campaign-, the Democratic party of this
district, even while the Populist National
Convention was in session, went ahead
and nominated its Congressional candi
date without conferring with the repre
sentatives of this party.
"The nominees of the other parties have
adopted the platforms of their respective
parties and I think it is now our duty to
nominate a candidate who would repre
sent the People's party and who would
command the admiration and respect of
every voter in the district. In this incon
sistent campaign let us do something
which is consistent with the principles of
our party."
On motion of H. A. Mason F. B. Brown
was unanimously elected secretary of the
convention. A rollcall of the twenty-one
delegates, constituting the full convention,
showed the following to be present:

artisans engaged in the handicrafts, sev
eral hundred are employed in adding to
that which is not merely useful â the ele
ment of beauty, the graces of form and
color that make esthetical objects for
houses and offices.
Now, it is a peculiar fact that the Jap
anese excel in making ornamental goods.
They are naturally good workmen, having
a strange manual dexterity almost from
birth, but they have for years made a
careful study in the lines lively to be de
manded by* the great western nations.
Early Japanese travelers in the West were
greatly pieased with our methods of house
decorations. Being an exceedingly imita
tive people, they forthwith began to manu
facture goods on our designs, and ere long
they began to introduce their own goods
to the West. The commonest observation
teaches i hat Japanese work in beads, car
pets, rugs and bamboo has driven many a
dollar from the home country.
It is noted particularly and emphasized
by all who know W. J. Bryan well, that
one of his strong mental weaknesses is his
total inability to see anything on his op
ponent's side of the question. For this
reason his speeches in Congress on the
tariff question singularly ignore any ref
erence to the possibility of dangerous
competition from the Orient. When con
fronted with the facts of the case Bryan
and his friends fall back on the general
fallacy that protection is for a special class
interest and derogatory to the entire
country. They suggest no remedy against
the threatened innovation from the
Orient.
JAMES TAYLOR ROGERS, Populist Nominee for Congress
in the Fifth District.
he is the representative of the whole people
and not of any special class or interest.
T c resolutions were unanimously
adopted.
Nominations for Congressman were
called for. H. A. Mason, in a highly eulo
gistic speech, praced Jame3 Taylor Rogers
in nomination.
E. E. Cothran placed AdoiDh Sutro's
name in nomination. He stated that the
Republican party lad nominated Eugene
F. Loud as its candidate for this office and
had on two previous occasions demon
strated its ability to elect him. He be
lieved that in order to defeat Mr. Loud a
very strong man would have to be placed
in nomination. .For his nominee he
claimed the ability to unite such forces
as would insure his election beyond any
auestlon; that he would draw "people to
him by a personal magnetism wnich
would overrule any affiliation with parties.
Dr. Daywalt seconded the nomination
of Rogers and referred to him as a man of
only moderate means who would be in
close sympathy with the masses. Refer
ence was made to the fact that Sutro was
a millionaire, whose interests could not
i be in concord with the poor.
Mr. Cothran, iv an eloquent speech,
which was tilled with the fire of energy
and earnestness, condemned what he
termed the prevailing warfare between
the "house of want and the house of
have." He denied that the principles of
the People's party were built upon the
narrow basis of antagonism to capital or
the anarchistic doctrine of warfare upon
all men who had money. He claimed
j that the only way for the Populist party
to secure the support of the intelligent
public was for it to appeal to human
reason and gain the support of the con
servative and thinking people, be they
rich or poor, in the abolition of the infer
nal systems which worked for the benefit
of the few at the expense oi the masses.
Dr. Shaner of Los Gatos seconded the
nomination ol Adolph Sutro.
H. A. Mason affirmed that Sntro was
more in accord with the Republican party
in his financial ideas than with the Popu
lists. He had declared himself in favor of
free silver, but had declared his doubt of
the ability of the United States alone to
maintain silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
Dr. bhaner said the ratio at which silver
could be maintained was a question which
had to be decided, and lie did not think
this idea should debar Mayor Sutro from
sei ving as the nominee of tue convention.
Joseph Asbury Johnson of San Fran
cisco said Mayor Sutro would not, in his
opinion, unite the Populists of San Fran
cisco. He aid not consider the financial
views of Mayor Sutro as being in har
nionv with those of the Populist party.
J. W. Hines spoke in favor of Rogers'
nomination, claiming that any disagree
ment of Adolph Sutro with the financial
plank of the Populist party should debar
him from nomination by that part}'.
The nominations were closed and bal
loting began. Rogers received 8 votes and
Adolph Sutro 3 votes. The chairman
stated that Mr. Rogers had not received a
majority of the convention, but Cothran
moved that the nomination of Mr. Rogers
be made unanimous and it was adopted.
H. A. Mason, J. W. Hines, C. H. Fuller,
R. A. Husted and Dr. Daywalt were ap
pointed as an auditing committee. The
chairman was instructed to reconvene tbe
convention iv case any vacancy occurred
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
In several important American cities,
however, business men, irrespective of
political affiliations, have seen the threat
ened evil in its true light, and meetings
have been held to protest against the
policy of let alone, of which Wilson and
"the' Boy Orator of the Platte" are chief
exponents.
An idea of what Japan may yet do in
other lines is readily obtainable by a
glance at what sue has already done in the
manufacture of cotton textiles. One
might, in this connection, readily para
phrase the well-known legal axiom, "false
in one, false in all," by saying, "Success
ful in one, successful in all." By this it is
meaut that the demonstration of Japan's
ability to do intricate work in one line ia
evidence that her people are able to grasp
the intricacies of manufacture in the
handicrafts as a whole. The ability of
manual dexterity is common to many
pursuits.
Comine to the question of cotton tex
tiles, it ia found at the outset that spin
ning and weaving mills are multiplying;
that the profits and growth Qf the industry
are sufficient to greatly encourage the
artisans of the Orient. It is seen at a
glance that they are as proficient in the
production of things unknown to them as
in the production of poods and wares com
mon in their happy kingdom irom time
immemorial.
The chief industry thus fat developed
is tbe spinning and weaving of cotton by
means of modern power machinery. The
success they have so far achieved is mar
velous, and the promise of future
achievements is a menace to all competi
i or business arose which required the con
sideration of the delegates.
James Taylor Rogers, present secretary
to Mayor Sutro, was born in the city of
Lexington, Mo., in 1848, and witn his pa
rents arrived in Sonoma County in 1852,
where he remained during his boyhood,
attending the public schools in that
county. Thence he went to Mendocino
County in 1874, and eventually came to
San Francisco in 188G and has remained
I here ever since.
After finishing his term in the public
I schools at Santa Rosa he entered the Pa
i cilic Methodist College at Vacaville, and
subsequently spent two year 3 and six
months at Santa Clara College. He next
went to Harvard, where he entered the
I law college, graduating in 1878, and in the
j same year was admitted to the bar by the
Supreme Court of this State. Before en
tering college he had studied law with the
late Governor H. H. Haight and Judge
Thomas.
His first vote was cast for Horace Greely
when that distinguished journalist ran for
President of the United States. With the
Democratic party he remained until 1893
when tne conduct of Grover Cleveland so
disgusted him that he affiliated with the
Populists.
As a public speaker Mr. Rogers is grace
ful and eloquent and leaves no doubt in
the minds of his hearers as to the convinc
ing force of his arguments. As a writer
he is clear and comprehensive. Speaking
of his policy on the silver question he
said:
"I am theoretically a fiat-money man,
but in this campaign, and until we get re
lief I am in favor of free silver, because it
will in a measure break the tyranny of the
single gold standard. The decree of the
j Nation in making money â be it written on
! any substance, paper, goid or silver â is not
j dependent on the value of sucn substance.
But to me and to the people of San Fran
cisco the importance of the funding bill is
more than the question of silver or gold
money. We will never have prosperity
until the influence or sway of that corpo
ration, the Southern Pacific Railroad, is
broken."
SVFFERIXQ AT COOKS INLET.
Stranded Miners Cannot Leave Alaska
Without Assistance.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 15.-The
steamer Queen, which arrived this morn
ing on its last Alaska trip of the season,
had as passengers a number of disap
pointed Cooks Inlet miners, one of whom
summarizes the situation thus:
"I never saw a better country to keep
away from. Everything seems to go
wrong, and there are men there who are
actually suffering from want. I don't
know what the poor fellows are going to
do, for they have no money, and without
money they cannot get out of the country.
It was reported at Sitka that the United
States revenue cutter Pinta was going to
the inlet to take away those who desired
to leave. I think the Government should
do something, for there is no way by
which the poor fellows can escape without
assistauce."

ment on page a 9 for men. '" ; '
tors. It is in this line that Americans
have at present most need ior fear.
Speaking of the subject quite recently,
Sir Edwin Arnold said':
"I am convinced that Japan will ere
long play very hot with Manchester, our
great English cotton manufacturing cen
ter, and there are American cities that
will feel this competition keenly."
The extent of this evil is shown in a re
cent number of the Jijl, a native paper
published in Yokohama. It says:
"The cotton-spinning industry of Japan
has made rapid strides, and the number of
spindles has reached 1.000.000. In conse
quence, the supply of yarns is far exceed
ing the demand."
It requires no deep reasoning to under
stand that the result of this condition will
be an attempt to reach a new marKet and
what country offers opportunities equal to
those presented in America, particularly
under the doctrines of free trade? The
Japanese see already that the Americans
are a great purchasing people. Not only
are they coming here in great numbers,
but they are laying Droad and deep the
foundations oa which to build a powerful
future trade.
In 1885 Japan imported but $800,000 worth
of raw cotton, but in 1894 she imported
$19,500,000 vorth, or more than twenty
four times as much. The growth of spin
dles was, ot course, correspondingly great.
Osaka is at present the great manu
facturing center of Japan. In that city
last year the thriving mills paid an aver
age dividend of 18 per cent, the highest
being 28 and the lowest 8 per cent. These
figures plainly indicate that the cotton in
MONTEITH IS
TURNED DOWN,
Democrats Break Faith
With First District
Populists.
THE RAILROAD ACCUSED
Its Policy Said to Be Anything
to Beat the People's
Party Man.
OCTOPTJ3 ATTORNEYS SCORED.
Votes Will Be Thrown io the Re
publican Ncmisee Rather Than
to Monteith.
NAPA, Cal., Aug. 15.â The First Dis
trict Democratic convention, which met
here to-day, turned down George W. Mon
teith very effectively. Mr. Monteith, who
is the Populist nominee for Congress from
the First District, expected to be indorsed
by the convention, but his name was not
even mentioned. A committee was ap
pointed to meet the conference committee
from the Populist party and if possible
agree upon a fusion candidate for Con
gressman.
It is whispered that the Democrats are
willing to support anybody but Monteith.
If the Populists, however, insist upon put
ting him on the ticket it is asserted that
the Democratic vote will be thrown to
Congressman Barham, the Republican
nominee. Monteith claims that this state
of affairs is the result of railroad interfer
ence. He said last night:
"Our experience to-day is an evidence of
what we are going to receive at the hand 3
of the Democrats. Apparently the only
use they have for us is to secure our votes.
I did not come to Napa with the idea that
i personally had any right to a Democratic
nomination. lam not a Democrat, but I
am a Populist, and had been given to un
derstand that this would be conceded, not
to me, but to the party.
"There were quite a number of delegates
here who sincerely wanted to deal justly
with us, but Mr. Geary and his proxies
were too much for them. lam satisfied
that the railroad company is at the bot
tom of this matter and that It has devised
this method of keeping me out of a posi
tion, in which they know I would be able
to frustrate some of their schemes.
"The Populist party had been led to be
lieve that the Democratic party would join
in the union of forces to secure the free
coinage of silver. We heartily and freely
nominated their candidate for President.
In return we expected to obtain their in
dorsement of at least three out of the
seven members of Congress in this State,
besides concessions upon the Legislative
ticket. This performance to-day is a good
indication that they are net sincere in
their professions. They have begun work
and have nominated a candidate in every
district in which we had a nominee in this
State except this district, and they will un
doubtedly place one in nomination here.
Theresultof that will be that they will so
disgust and anger our people that it is hard
to tell just what will be the final outcome.
"The plea of the district convention
here is that the State committee has no
control over the district convention, and
if this proposition is carried to its logical
conclusion it will apply to every Assembly
and Senatorial district In the State, and
the Populists will get beautifully left.
We were perfectly willing to meet them
in a spirit of fairness and justice, while on
their part they are disposed to take ad
vantage of the situation. I have seen
enough here to-day to satisfy me, and do
not intend to be a party to any further
negotiations at all. I begin my campaign
a week from to-day, and I shall go to
work and make a straight Populist and
anti-railroad fight all down the line. The
Democrats can do just what they ple&se.
"I have delayed my campaign for
several weeks upon the promise that they
were going to do something. Indeed I
have done everything that could be done
to brinar about an understanding. Now,
after having made all my arrangements
and having got my fight fully organized,
they deliberately come to me and suggest
that I withdraw. That I certainly will
not do in any event. lam on the ticket,
dnstry is richly remunerative. In the
United States and in England during the
same era the outlook for the mills has
been very bad.
The position of the Democratic party on
the subject of protection is now so well
known that no one looks for relief from
Japan by the aid of that party. Wi ether
applied to the cheap products of Japan or
to those of the world at large the Wilson
bill works evil. A writer on the subject-
Senator Jacob Gallinger of New Hamp
shire â has well said of the Wilson bill :
"The Wilson bill is an elaborate at
tempt to carry out the principles, on the
subject of a tariff, that were incorporated
into the Democratic platform at Chicago
in 1892. Its author, Mr. Wilson, and its
supporters claim that it is closely modeled
after the Walker tariff act of 1846, which
has been fully described and the evil re
sults of which have been pointed out. The
Wilson bill as reported and as It passed
the House was a thorough free-trade bill
in effect, whatever may have been tbe in
tention of its author" It struck down at
a blow all the leading industries of the
country by putting iron ore, coal, wool,
lumber and many other leading articles
upon the free list." It was fought earnestly
and well by Republicans, but was made
a party measure and pushed through the
House without answering or honestly at
tempting to answer the facts and argu
ments against it. As it came to the Sen
ate it was inimical and dangerous to the
business interests of Beveral States which
were represented in the Senate by Demo
crats."
If the Wilson bill, a mild form of free
trade, has already struck down many
iniDortant industries of the country, what
could be. expected of Bryan's principles of
absolute free trade as a means of bringing
even the slightest relief to the already
overburdened workingmen of the coun
try?
The most careful study of the question
of Oriental competition convinces best that
such a principle as that championed by tho
Republicans is the only one that can be
expected to bring relief. That without
protection there cannot be prosperity or
I contentment among the masses.
and there to stay. If they do not display
a proper spirit toward the Populist party
there is no law that I know of that will
compel them to do so.
i. "1 certainly ; have no i further time to
waste in what I know will be fruitless dis
cussion. They have no intention of doing
anything except to try to induce me to with
i draw, which I have no intention of doing.
J Therefore there is no room for any argu
ment. â  ,â ; , -â¢
i "So far as the committee that was ap
pointed is concerned there are several
excellent gentlemen upon it, but it will be
dominated by railroad influence. They
might just as well have made Mr. Herrin
the l^ chairman as Mr. Geary. I will not
have any dealing with Mr. Geary under \
any circumstances or upon any terms
whatsoever. It will be utterly useless for
them to send a committee that contains
any railroad attorneys in its personnel to
talk to me. I will not deal . with it in any
way, shape or form. On ; the contrary, I
defy the railroad and all its methods! and .
warn its people that they are simply wast
ing their time in trying to hoodwink me."

The adjourned session of the Sixth Dis
trict Congressional convention was called
to order in the opera-house by W. C. Bow
man, chairman of the convention as it
'was constituted at Sacramento. A. G.
Hinckley of Los Angeles officiated as sec
retary. J. V. Webster was elected chair
man.
It was decided that when the nomina
tion for Congress was in order an informal
ballot be taken and each of the men voted
for De then called to the platform to ex
press his views. The first ballot under
the arrangement resulted as follows: H.

5, G. T. BrucÂ»4, H. H. Clark 3, W. C. Bow
man 3, J. M. Powell 1, and George S. Pat
ton 1. Total, 31.
Judge Utley of Los Angeles read the
platform reported by the committee. It
merely indorsed the principles.of the party
as stated in the St. Louis Populist plat
form and placed the party on record as
being in favor of fusion by the following
resolution:
Jletolved, That we insist upon an equitable
division of the electoral vote equal to onr nu
merical strength.
Each candidate having stated his posi
tion, the balloting began, twenty-five
votes being necessary for a choice. The
first five ballots resulted as follows:

Los Angeles forced an adjournment for
fifteen minutes. On reassembling Los An
geles County made an effort to stampede
the delegates to Rush, whom they said the
Democrats would indorse. A hurried con
sultation was held with Ventura, which
had been voting for Patton, a Democrat,
on every ballot, to swing Ventura's dele
gates into line for Rush. It could not be
done.
Secretary Hinckley began calling the
roll. Moore of Los Angeles announced
nineteen votes for Rusn. In another
moment W. C. Bowman waa on his feet
protesting. He said he had been voted
for Rush, and he did not care to do any
such thing. Moore then changed the vote
to eighteen for Rush, and Bowman voted
for Barlow.
This was the signal for great applause,
and the counties swung into line for Bar
low and he received thirty-one votes, the
combined vote of Monterey, San Luis
ObiÃpo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Santa
Cruz.
Barlow was declared the nominee and
came forward and thanked tue conven
tion. On motion of Mr. Sprague the nom
ination was made unanimous.
GRASS VALLEY DEMOCRATS.
Opening of Their Campaign by Con
gressman Maguire.
GRASS VALLEY, Cal., Aug. 15.â The
Democrats opened their campaign this
evening with a speech by Congressman
James G. Maguire. A special train from
Nevada City of four cars, bringing mostly
women and children, arrived about 8
o'clock, and immediately afterward Dr. I.
W. Hays called the meeting to order and
introduced the speaker of the evening.
The free silver sentiment being strong
here and the people being eager for a
lucid explanation of that subject, a com
paratively large crowd was present and
heard the opening remarks. As the
speaker did not impress the audience in
the beginning of his argument, the crowd
soon began to grow smaller and lose inter
est. Not much enthusiasm was manifest
ed and the opening meeting was a decided
frost for the Democrats.
Congressman Maguire spoke for two
hours on the silver question, trying to im
press his hearers with the idea of better
times under a Democratic administration.
He denounced the administration of Har
rison in unmeasured terms and evaded the
policy and actions of the present admini
stration. During his whole speech he cre
ated no enthusiasm, and beside a few
handclaps no applause was heard. He de
voted some time to the explanation of the
alleged control of the United States Treas
ury by the Morgan syndicate of New York
and offered as a solution the election of
I Bryan and a free-silver Congress.
During parts of his speech he was
J obliged to ask for better attention, as dis
j interested persons would converse near
! the platform. He denounced the actions
! and policy of Congressman Grove L. John
j son, condemning his course on the fund
ing bill and saying he was not a friend of
the workintjman. After concluding the
customary three cheers TÂ«ere given for the
speaker and the Presidential nominees.

IRVINE ACCUSES MERRITT.
Sensational Charge* of fraud in the
Use of a Proxy.
LOS ANGELES, Cal m Aue. 15.â A tre
mendous political sensation was created
here this afternoon by the receipt of a
letter from John Irvine of Salinas City, a
delegate to the Sixth District convention
of the Democratic party, alleging duplicity
en the part of M. R. Mcrritt, chairman of
that convention. ? Irvine, in his letter to
George Patton, asserts positively that in
giving his proxy to Merritt he expressly
stipulated that his vote should be cast for
Pation so long as he , remained before the
convention, whereas Chairman Merritt
cast his own vote â¢ and that of Irvine's
proxy for L. J. Rose, Patton's opDonent.
A number of delegates to the adjourned
convention of next Monday are already
in the city, and the friends of Patton are
denouncing Merntt in unmeasured terms.
Merritt is one of the Democratic Presiden
tial electors, and it is . asserted Dy the
Patton men that in view of this exposure
an effort will be made to take him off the
ticket.
Delegate Irvine now revokes the proxy
to Merritt and appoints Delegate Wright
to cast the proxy for Patton.
McLaehlan at Santa Monica.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Aug. 15.-The
campaign was opened here to-night by the
Republicans. A most successful rally was
held under the auspices of tne Santa
Monica McKinley Club, which is doing
valiant service for protection and sound
money. The opera-house was packed to
the doors by Santa Monicans, many ladies
gracing the occasion. Congressman Mc-
Laehlan was the principal speaker. He
dilated upon the prosperity that was sure
to come with the election of McKinley and
the enforc?ment of a tariff to protect the
American laborer. Luther G. Brown and
S. M. Haskeil. editor of the Pomona Prog
ress, also addressed the audience.

ERIE MEDICAL CO., Buffalo, N.Y.OPPOSED TO THE
NEW CHARTER
Pamphlet Issued by the
Municipal Reform
League.
DEFECTS ARE ALLEGED.
Ten Reasons Set Forth for
Taking an Attitude of
Hostility.
A LONG ARGUMENT OFFERED.
Criticism of Many Essential Details
of the New Plan for Muni
cipal Government.
A pamphlet is in circulation in the City,
which has the caption: "Why the pro
posed new charter should not be adopted,"
The reasons which are alleged for opposi
tion to the charter are enumerated on one
page, concisely, as follows:
Firstâ lt is too long.
Secondâ lt is dangerously, if not fatally, de
fective.
Thirdâ lt practically prohibits municipal
ownership of public utilities, and retards in
stead ot expediting business.
Fourthâ lt is uncertain and contradictory in
its provisions.
Fifthâ lt is unconstitutional in many and
important respects.
Sixinâ lt is unwise in lta policy.
Seventhâ lt places too much power in the
hands of one man.
Eghthâ lt reverses the natural order of mu
nicipal administration in giving legislative
power to the Mayor, instead ot making the
authors ol laws responsible for the enforce
ment of them.
Ninthâ lt violates the natural right of many
persons to earn a living in a profession for
which they are qualified ; and
Tenthâ lf adopted, it will take longer find be
more difficult to amend it than, after rejecting
it, to prepare and adopt a wisely conceived
and just charter.
The pamphlet having made these aver
ments proceeds to discuss them seriatim.
Concerning the length of the proposed
charter the followlne is alleged:
"It is unnecessarily and danserously
long. It is longer than the Magma (Jharta
and Bill of Rights of Great Britain, the
Declaration of American Independence,
the constitutions of the Dnited States and
of Californiaâ it is twice as long as these all
combined. It contains nearly 80,000 words
and innumerable provisions, every one of
which will Lave to be passed upon by the
Supreme Court before we can be assured
oi their meaning."
As to whether the proposed charter is
"fatally defective" as alleged the author
of the pamphlet asserts, in substance, that
no office is made elective except the Super
visors, that it defeats the municipal own
ership of public and retards in
stead of expediting business and "meta
phorically places the great municipal cor
poration ot San Francisco in a strait
jacket." For particulars the pamphlet
alie.-es in this connection that to secure
public ligiit and water works, under the
proposed charter, the following conditions
are essential:
-The Jlayor must be 1= favor oi it.
::dâ The entire Board of Public Works
must lavor it, and
Thirdâ Nine of the Supervisors must also be
in favor of it beiore any such proposition can
be submitted to the people.
It is alleged that "it (the proposed char
ter) does not provide any means by which
the Mayor, who is to rule all departments
oi'the City Government, is to get his office,
nor for the election by the people ol any
officer except the Supervisors; but does
say (Article 14, section 26) that every office
not made elective by this charter shall
become vacant immediately on the taking
effect of this charter. If the charter is
adopted in November next and is approved
by the Legislature of California (accord
ing to the provision quoted) we will have
no head of government, no Auditor, no
Assessor, no Tax Collector, no Treasurer,
no Recorder, and the legality of the acts
of every one of these officials, if they seefc
to retain their office, will be called in
question by interested parties. Rich cor
porations will seek to evade their taxes
and refuse compliance to the City ordi
nances because of the equivocal and doubt
ful position of the Mayor and other offi
cers, and chaos would reign in every de
partment."
The charter is attacked because "it re
quires that all city work amounting to
more than ?500 shall be done by contract" ;
and also on the ground that it is ''uncer
tain and contradictory and contains ridic
ulous repetitions.' ' The allegations of the
pamphlet on this point are as follows :
"In granting powers there are two sys
tems. One is to give absolute power
miuus such express reservations as shall
be desired. Tbe other is to give specified
powers and retain by implication all oth
ers. The authors have bought to combine
the two. They first granted absolute pow
ers and then undertook to qualify the
grant by clauses making specific grant of
each power intended to De given, thereby
creating tfce confusion from which there is
no outlet save through the courts, for until
the courts have passed upon the matter
we have no way of knowing what powers
are eranted and what withheld. This is
an example of careless construction, of
which there are many in the proposed
charter. We shall briefly mention one
more. On page 66 it is provided that the
Public Administrator shall be appointed
by the Mayor, while on page 211 it is pro
vided that 'whenever the laws of the State
of California shall have been so altered
and amended as to permit the appoint
ment' of Public Administrator he shall be
appointed by the Mayor. Tbe first quoted
provision is unconstitutional. The courts
alone can tell what the other may be."
As to the charge that the proposed
charter is unconstitutional the following
specifications are made. It conflicts with
the laws of the State by its restriction on
the power of the Supervisors to fix the tax
levy; the civil service rules are unconsti
tutional; the Board of Education is un
constitutional. As a recapitulation one
page is under the caption, "Unwise in
Policy," and the following are given as
instances of unwisdom :
FirstâBecause it fixes the salaries of nearly
every class of employes, so that a change can '
only be obtained by charter amendment.
Secondâ Because it favors contract work and j
prohibits day labor whenever the projected
improvement shall cost more than $500.
Thirdâ Because it renders it extremely diffi
cult for the City to undertake the construction
of waier, cas and electric light works and
street railroads on iis own account.
Fourthâ Because it provides (article 11, chap
ter 1, section 'Z) that the Supervisors shall be
elected from the City and County at large,,
whereby it may easily come about that one
ward may secure to itself an undue share of
representation, leaving to others none at all.
Fittuâ Because it makes the Board of Public
Works a body appointed by the Mayor. A sys
tem which Oakland has done away with with
in the past two years in order to make the
Board of Public Works an elective bodyâbe
cause the appointive system was very unsatis
lactoryâand yet the advocates of the charter
loualy proclaim this feature as one of its ad
van tMgeb.
Srxthâ And it inexpedient, be
cause it gives place to red tape, where sim
plicity would be much preferable.
The other principal allegations are:
That it makes the Mayor a municipal dic
tator; that it reverses the natural order of
municipal administration in giving legis- i
Jative powers to the Mayor instead of re- j
serving the administration as well as the
making of laws to the administrative I
branch: that the provisions respecting the
qualification for teaching violate the
natural and constitutional ripht of a lar<;e
class of citizens to earn a livine by the
exercise of a profession which they "have
elected and for which they are qualified.
The attack upon the provisions concern
ing the teachers is as follows:
"Article VII, chapter 111, section 4 of
this voluminous document provides that
no person jhall be a 'teacher in the pri
mary or grammar classes of this City and
County except' he has 'been educated In
the public school system of the State of
California.' A person who has been edu
cated by the best of private tutors, in the
best private schools of the State or in the
public or private schools of any other
State or nation, is barred from the right
to earn a living (in a calling the duties of
which he by education and training may be
able to perform in a pre-eminently supe
rior manner) because be was not educated
in the public schools of this State, and for
no other reason. A man may have been
born in the State, be educated in the
State, be public-spirited, be talented, a
skillful instructor and an honorable citi
zen, but, according to the new charter, he
shall not teach. Is this just? Does not
this cause alone brand with infamy this
charter, and every one knowing the ex
istence of this clause who shall vote for its
adoption? We maintain that this provi
sion is not only infamous, but that it is
contrary to the constitutional rights of
the citizen."
The pamphlet is signed by Rev. J. E.
Scott as president and P. J. Healy as sec
retary of the Municipal Reform League.
ORDERED NEW BOATS.
One of Them Is to Be Here by March
and Will Replace the
Monowal.
James Mills, managing director of the
Union Steamship Company, New Zealand,
which owns and operates fifty-five steam
ers which run between New Zealand, Aus
tralia and the Pacific islands, is here after
six months' absence in England. Mr.
Mills has Been ordering some more vessels
to strengthen his steamship line, already
the largest in New Zealand. One of tnese
is now substantially completed and the
others are under way. When the latter
are finished one of them will be put on
the water between here and Australia to
take the place of the Monowai, which,
with other steamers of the Union line, has
been running in connection with the
Spreckels steamers.
Mr. Mills is a gentleman of large experi
ence in the steamship business. "You
see, it is necessary," he said last night, "to
keep putting in new steamers, those of
later styles and greater adaptation to the
business, to take the place of those that
are getting old. These vessels which lam
having made in England will be very fine.
The engines will be very perfect, and I
may add that everything about the vessels
will be."
The steamer which will replace the
Monowai is the Moana, 360 feet lone by 44
feet, with 34 feet depth of hold, and of 4700
tons. She will average fifteen knots an
hour loaded. She will be a very elegant
vessel. The Moana is expected to be here
by March next. One of the other ships
ordered is the Walkare, of 3000 tons capa
city. While absent Mr. Mills also boYight
a cargo steamer of 3000 tous capacity for
the Fiji sugar trade.
MISSION BRANCH WON,
In a Spirited Athletic Contest
the Main Y. M. C. A.
Loses Laurels.
Hereafter an Athletic Competition Is
Likely to Be One of the An
nual Events.
Out at the grounds of the Mission
branch of the Y. M. C. A., on Mission
street, between Nineteenth and Twen
tieth, yesterday afternoon, a merry time
was had in competitive athletic sports.
The contestants on the one side were the
members of the Mission branch and on
the other side the main body of the asso
ciation.
It is estimated that the membership
of the main body is about one
thousand, while there are only 109 mem-
Ders of the Mission branch ; nevertheless,
the smaller organization managed to win
nine out of the eleven events. All the
winners will receive a silver triangle
medal, the emblem of the Y. M. C. A., the
donors of which are Dr. H. L. Diets and
J. G. Daub. Diets is the physical director
of the main body and Daub the branch
secretary.
The scores in the athletic events were
ten points for first place and five points
for second. The sum total of the points
scored by the boys of the branch were 120,
their opponents carrying off only 40.

ular event, but the intention for the future
is to make it an annual event.
INSPECTORS WILL CONFER.
United States and Local Meat Expert! to
Come to an Understanding.
A conference of the United States and
local meat inspectors is to be held within
the next few days to devise ways and
means of acting more harmoniously and
efficiently together than has been the rule
in the past
Hitherto there has been no arrange
ment between the two forces regarding the
condemning of meat unsuitable for human
use and the result has been some dissatis
faction.
Meat tagged by the United States in
spectors as bad passes no inspection by
tbe local authorities and cannot be kept
track of ty them, and it is to remedy this
matter and see that all condemned meat
finds its way to the fertilizing works that
the conference is to be held.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
A HORSE THAT
MUTES THE POLICE,
Mounted Policeman McKen
na Its Particular
Enemy.
KEPT HIM IN HOT WATER
It Was Owned by Cornelius
Shine, Dairyman, on the
San Bruno Road.
HE HAD TO SEND IT AWAY.
A Few Days Ago It Broke From Its
Corral and Chased McKenna
for Over a Mile.
Cornelius Shine, a dairyman on the San
Bruno road, near the Golden City House,
owns a valuable horse that is a terror to
the neighborhood. The horse is tractable
enough when in harness, but as soon as it
is placed in the corral it gets restless and
The Equine Hater of the Police Cbasing One of His Mounted V.ctims.
breaks out. Then it roams around in
search of trouble.
It aniusod itself by trying to bite the
drivers of wagons passing along the mad
and showed its playfulness by kicking
the wagons with its hind heels. Some
times it varied the monotony by chasing a
pedestrian, who would seek refuge in some
place which the horse could not reach.
For some unaccountaDle reason the
horse took a special dislike to Mounted
Policeman McKenna. Whether in harness
or out of harness whenever it saw Mc-
Kenna it made for him with open mouth.
McKenna used to fiil his saddle-bags with
rocks and when the horse made a rush at
him he would throw the rocks at it to drive
it off. This made the horse more bitter in
its dislike to the mounted policeman and
finally McKenna rode up to Seine's dairy
and let loose his feelings.
"See here. Shine," he said, "I am get
ting tired of this sort of business. I don't
intend to let that horse of yours monkey
with me any longer. You have got to
get rid of it or I will do something des
perate. I will bring suit against you or
kill the horse in self-defense."
The horse was in the corral and while
McKenna was talking it jumped over the
fence and open-aiouthed made a rush at
McKenna. Shine tried to stop the an
imal but it paid no attention to him.
McKenna had forgotten to arm himself
with rocks. He grasped his revolver and
for an instant was undecided what to do.
The horse was within a few yards of him
and loosed so formidable that McKenna
dug tbe spurs into his horse and lied at
full gallop, hotly pursued by Shine's horse.
The chase was kept up for about a mile
and McKenna succeeded in making his
escape. Things had to come to a crisis
and last Friday McKenna went to Snine's
with blood in his eye. He demanded that
his enemy be instantly sent to some other
part of the country' or there would be
trouble. Shine pacified him by telling
him that tne horse would annoy him no
more, as he had sent him away forever.
McKenna rode round the ranch to
satisfy himself that his enemy was not in
sight. He was relieved to find that Shine
was not deceiving him.
A TUG'S FAST BOUND TRIP
The Fearless Towed a Vessel
to Port Costa and Returned
in Five Hours.
Captain Tulloch of the British Ship
Brenaa Is Dangerously 111 in
St. Luke's Hospital.
It was a very busy day on the water
front yesterday. The tugs were alien
gaged and schooners, barks and ships
were moved in all directions. Many of
them went to sea, some went to Port
Costa and others have been laid up in
Oakland Creek.
The tug Fearless made the record of the
season. Leaving Folsom-streot wharf she
went to Sausalito, picked up the British
ship St. Mungo and towed her to Port
Costa. After docking the vessel under the
elevator the big tue came back to San
Francisco, making the round trip in five
hours. Captain Hawley did not expect
the Fearless back uutii noon and was sur
prised to see her tied up at Folsom street
two hours earlier.
All the men in the "black-stack" line
are working double time.
The Fearless went out at 10 o'clock this
morning with a fishing party. The Cor
dell banks will be visited, and if the
fishermen are not seasick a good catch
should be made. The gentlemen form
ing the party are the guests of W. T. Gar
ratt.
The American ship Santa Clara was sold
yesterday to George W. Hume for $19,000.
She is an old vessel, but ia as sound to-day
as the day she was launched. Sue niaiiw
an unusually long passage from New
York and reinsurance was paid on her.
Captain Fuller, however, asserts that his
vessel is as stanch as anything afloat, and
that had it not been for the terrible
weather and baffling winds he could have
made a record. Should the bark Cory
puene arrive here in timo Captain Grant,
who is on her, will take command of the
Santa Clara.
Captaiu Tulloch of the British ship
Breuda is lying dangerously ill at St.
Luke's Hospital. He was not a well man
when the vessel got in from London and
eot gradually worse. He is now down
with typhoid malarial fever and his life is
despaired of.
The British ship Balclutlia arrived from
Swansea after a rather lengthy passage of
135 day 8. She was caught in a hurricane
on June 7 in latitude 55 55 south, longi
tude 62 51 west, and shifted her cargo.
The decks were swept and considerable
damage was done. When the storm sub
sided the cargo was trimmed and the ves
sel experiened no more troubles. On May
24 a can buoy painted red was passed. On
it the figure "3" was painted in white. It
is probably one of the can buoys along the
Atlantic coast that went adrift last winter.
The British tramp steamer Strathgarrv
has played in hard luck. She came here
under charter to Trubenbach & Co. for
Â£1 10. On her arrival Mr. Trubenbach had
died and the executors of the estate would
not recognize the charter. The vessel was
thrown on the market and yesterday she
was rechartered by G. W. McNear for
Â£1 6 to carry barley to Liverpool.
A coat and vest was picked up on Spear
street wharf yesterday and taken to the
Harbor Police Station. In the pocket was
a card bearing tbe name "Cyril C. Mowat,

YACHT CLUBS ENTERTAIN
Sausalito the Scene of Two
Very Merry Gath
erings.
The Pacific and the San Francisco
Clubs Entertain Their Friends in
a Charming Manner.
The Pacific Yacht Club, at its charming
i home at Sausalito last evening, gave a
delightful "at home." The affair was the
tirst of a series to be given monthly dur
ing the winter, and the success of the
initial fete will cause the members of the
club and their most favored friends to be
on the tip-toe of expectancy for the
second.
The majority of the guests arrived by
the tug Vigilant, which left the Mission
street wharf at 7 o'clock. This party was
contributed to generously by pleasure
seekers from Belvedere, who were brought
over in the launches Cynthia, Wialaly
and Wang.
It was a delightful evening for an out
ing, a little breezy on the bay perhaps,
but no true yachtsman objects to a breeze,
and in the sylvan cove where nestles the
Pacific clubhouse the air was quiet and
balmy. The music was excellent, and to
its strains the merry couples danced until
nearly midnight. A collation was served.

FAIR'S LETTERS
TO BE PRODUCED
They Have All Been Ex
ploited Before a
Camera.
C. L. FAIR DEPOSING.
Questions Asked About an Oak
land Expert on Hand*
vriting.
TESTIMONY COMES HARD.
Promise Ma3e to Bring Into Court
Certain Papers Cal'ed For
Upon Subpsna.
The deposition of Charles L. Fair took
an interesting turn yesterday. Mr. Del
mas inquired concerning the action of the
deponent between the time when he peti
tioned to have the Craven will admitted
to probate and the time when his attorney
moved to have that instrument withdrawn
from probate. Many very interesting
questions which Mr. Delmas asked were
not answered, Mr. Fair declining, under
tbe advke of Mr. Heggerty, to answer
them. Mr. Delmas wanted to find out
what methods had been adopted and what
papers had been produced to compare
with the handwriting of the Craven will.
It took a great number of questions to pet
the desired admission. Mr. Heggerty
finally framed some of tbe answers for his
client, with the consent of Mr. Delmas, in
reference to the production of papers
under the subpena issued. Mr. Fair tes
tified that some letters and other papers,
which he knew to be in his father's hand
writing, liad been taken to Garber, Boalt
& Bishot>'s office, where they had been
photographed. He also testified that one
expert had told him that the Craven will
was a forgery. Other persons had ex
pressed to him the opinion that the in
strument was a forgery, but he declined,
under the advice of counsel, to say who
these persons are. Concerning the hand
writine expert who had said that the
writing was forged, Mr. Delmas asked:
"Were you advised by one or by more
than one expert?"
"Well, by one in particular."
"Was there more than one in particular
or in general?"
"There was one in particular."
"is it not true that there was not more
than one and that the one was Mr. Horton
of Oakland?"
Mr. Heggerty objected very promptly to
an answer being given to this and Mr.
Fair declined to answer.
"Is it not true that only one expert ever
declared the Craven will to be a forgery
and that be was named Horton and that
he lived in Oakland?"
The witness declined to answer.
'â¢Is it not true," persisted Mr. Delmas,
"that the only expert who ever expounded
that theory was Air. Horton of Oakland,
and that soon after it was submitted to
him, and that he left you because yon
would not submit to a demand to pay him
$2500 for his services?"
Mr. Heggerty interposed and the de
ponent once more declined to answer.
"Is it not true that the expert lived in
Oakland and that his name was Horton,
and that in 1895, after yen had refused to
pay him $2500, he tried to peddle that
information, offering it wherever he
thoucht he could sell it?"
Mr. Fair â I decline to answer.
"Did you not afterward take Mr. Horton
back into your camp?"
To this there was no response.
Mr. Delmas asked whether Mr. Fair
believed that tbe Craven will was in his
father's writing at the time he petitioned
to have that instrument admitted to pro
bate.
'â¢Yes, air, at that time I did."
"And your petition for the filing of the
Craven wiJl stood until after Judge Slack
had decided that the trust under the trust
will was invalid?"
"According to the best of my belief
Judge Slack decided that the trust will
should be tried first."
"Up to April, when you withdrew your
petition for probating the Craven will,
had yon expressed in court any doubt
concerning the genuineness of the Craven
will?"
"I don't think that I did."
"Did you approve of the proceedings of
your attorneys when they withdrew the
Craven will?"
"Yes, sir."
"Was the right reserved to bring for
ward the Craven will at any time?"
"I don't know; some rights were re
served."
"Did you understand it that way?"
"Yes, I understood so; that it left open
the right to bring the Craven will forward
again."
What hapi>ened between the time when
the Craven will was filed and the time
when it was withdrawn, Mr. Falrdescribed
in part. "We employed experts to ex
amine tlie handwriting. One of these
told me that the will was a fraud. Other
people told me the same. T;ere are other
circumstances which I do not care to dis
close at this time."
Mr. Delmasâ l wish that you would
disclose them.
Mr. Hegeerty instructed the deponent
not to answer, and his advice was fol
lowed. Mr. Fair also declared that he
never had entertained any doubt that
under the Craven will he would get one
fourth of the estate.
"Was not one reason why you changed
your attitude toward the (Jrayen will that
you believed that the trust will, with the
trust eliminated, was more favorable to
you and that by adopting the trust will
yon would avoid the payment of $500,000
to Mrs. Nettie R. Craven?"
"No, sir."
"Did not the desire to avoid paying
Mrs. Craven $500,000 influence your
course?"
"No, sir."
"Was not the decision left to Richard F.
Dey concerning the amount which should
be paid to Mrs. Craven?"
Mr. Fair declined to answer.
"Have you any papers containing your
father's handwriting?"
"I have some private letters of my
father's."
"Were these letters used in testing the
Craven will?"
Mr. Fair declined to answer that ques
tion, and also declined to answer whether
he had produced all writings of his father's
as commanded to do by the snbpena. He
believed that certain of his father's letters
were submitted to an expert in 1895, after
the filing of the Craven will. He could
not say how many there were of these let
ters. They have never been returned, and
he declined to answer as to where they
are. He supposed them to be in the pos
session of Mr. Treat, who is a clerk for
Charles R. Wheeler of the firm of Garber,
Boalt & Bishop. He last saw them in Mr.
Treat's possession. That was seven or
eight months ago. The following dialogue
occurred on this point:
"Is Mr. Treat a photographer? "
"1 believe that he is."
"Did he photograph those papers?"
"I don't know."
"Did you ever hear that he had photo
graphed them?"
"No."
"Did you ever see the photographs?"
"Yes, some of them."
"And those were made.for the purpose
of deterniining the genuineness of the
pencil wilt by comparison?"
"I believe that they were made for that
purpose."
"Do you not know that they were made
for that purpose ?"
''Yes, I know that.'
The conclusion of the proceedings of the
day were interesting. Mr. Delmas asked
whether Mr. Fair declined to produce the
papers that were called for in the sub
pena. Mr. Heggerty, attorney for Mr.
Fair, answered all the questions on this
point for his client, and his answers were
set down as coming from M/. Fair.
"All that I want is an answer," Mr.
Delmas said, and suggested that Mr. Heg
gerty should shape the answer. Then he
asked :
"Do yon understand that the subpena
calls upon you to produce all papers
signed or purporting to be signed by your
father, and do you, acting under that sub
pena, refuse to produce any papers?"
Mr. Heggerty declined, for his client, in
several answers, to produce any papers
unless the papers are specified so that they
could be selected by Mr. Fair, but finally
agreed that the papers which were given
to Mr. Treat shall be produced before the
deposition of Charles L. Fair shall be con
cluded. Mr. Delmas then said that he de
sired to see these papers and could not go
on until they have been produced, and
the further taking of Mr. Fair's deposition
went over until next Wednesday at 10
A. m. ______________

into a small puddle and a" wagon rolled
over his walking-stick and broke it.
Hastily gathering himself and his posses
sions together, he ; made his way to the
curb, and ; addressing ' a man who was
standing thereiwatching him, said, appre
hensively â¢â W&&*
"Is it gone? Did any one else see it and
pick it up?" 'â -.â¢'â¢;â¢'â '
Without waiting for a reply he dived out
into the street again and returned in tri
umph, bearing a horseshoe.
' "That's what I call luck," he remarked,
gleefully. "There were a lot of people in
that car who might have got this horse
shoe, but I managed to grab it before any
one else did."
-â¢'.What's up?" inquired the man on the
curbstone. "la the Government paying a
bounty for horseshoes?" Â»V
"Why, man, it's the luckiest thing in the
world to pick up a horseshoe. I wouldn't
have missed it for anything."
"I don't see that you have been so very
lucky. You've spoiled your hat getting
that precious piece of old iron."
"Oh, well, it wasn't a very new hat."
"And your stick is broken and your col
lars and cuff 8 are shockingly soiled." -
"I know it. But I was bound to get that
horseshoe."
He looked at his watch and exclaimed :
"I wonder if I have the right time."
"It's just ten minutes of 2."
"And I was on my way to catch the 2
o'clock train! If I had stuck to the car I
would have barely made it. I wouldn't
have missed that train for $150. I may as
well go on downtown now and send a tele
gram saving that I can't keep the engage
ment. ; I don't know how it'll turn out,
but it's liable to cost me a good deal in
time and in money. . While I'm there I
may as well buy a new hat and a new stick
and some linen, and have the lock on this
traveling-bag repaired. 1 certainly seem
to be in trouble. About the only luck I've
had to-day was rinding that horseshoe."

DEMOCRACY'S NEW
BUNKO GAME,
The State Fusion Committee
Named by Chairman
Alford.
IT HAS TROUBLES AHEAD
Populist Suspicions Increase
and Fusion Prospects
Daily Decrease.
DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE ALL.
Withdrawal of the Populist Nominee
Demanded in the First and
None Want Watson.
Chairman Alford of the Democratic
State Central Committee last night named
the delayed conference or fusion commit
tee which has such a hard job ahead of it.
This interesting committee is as follows:
M. F. Tarpey, Alameda, chairman ; Eugene
N. Deuprey, James G. Maguire, M. C. Has
sett. San Francisco; Woodson Gerrard,
Calaveras; A. Caminetti, Amador; W. H.
Alford. Chairman Alford was made a
memDerof the committee by the resolu
tion creating it.
It is easier to appoint a committee to
play the game with the Populists, and the
silverites, too, than it will be to finish the
game without the display oi bowieknives.
The leaders oi both the Populist and
Democratic parties talk very discreetly
and kindly about fusion and about each
other when they are being interviewed
for publication, but beneath the sur
faoe there is so much distrust,
double-dealing and so noticeable a
disposition on the part of the Democracy
to "hog" things that the prospects are
that there will not only be here a merry
row and exhibitions of bitterness such as
have preceded the party alliances formed
in some other States, but a tangle that
will destroy all chances of fusion with the
Populists in California.
Tbe inchoate fusion proposition now in
formally being studied by the Democratic
and Populist leaders involves fusion on
electors, Congressmen and legislative can
didates. But there are various things in
the way of carrying out this programme,
or any part of it.
The First District, in which the Demo
cratic Congressional Convention met yes
terday, is a sample of how Congressional
fusion will go. There ex-Congressman
Thomas J. Geary controlled a proxy
convention, through the possession of
proxies. Prison Director Wilkins was one
of the district powers allied with Geary.
Geary and his friends are administration
goldbugs, and, though they appointed a
conference committee, the ultimatum they
informally gave out was that if there was
to be any fusion the Populists must first
pull down their candidate, George W.
Monteith, and declare the field open.
Mr. Monteith was nominated by the
Populists about three months ago, has put
in much labor for the cause, has the con
fidence of the party and possesses the
support of a laree laboring element. But
the Democrats ask a new deal, in which
they can win what there is to be had.
They make a bold effort to use the Popu
list party as a catspaw to pull out chest
nuts which they would have no earthly
chance of getting without Populist help.
There was indignation last night among
the leading Populists of this City when
the result of the Napa convention became
known, and there was consternation
among the Democratic leaders as they
foresaw tbe probable effect on the entire
fusion play. In no Congressional district
have the Democrats shown any disposi
tion to consider the Populists except to
ask them why they should not eet in and
back up the Democratic nominee.
But In no district have the Democrats
put up a man whom* the Populists who
respect their principles could indorse.
In the matter of electors the Democrats
demand Sewail and sneerat "Watson.
"ft makes little difference what the
Populist committee agrees to do, for
enough Populists will vote for Bryan and
Sewall to carry the ticket anyway," may
be heard from the lips of leading Demo
crats almost hourly.
"Tue Democracy shows a disposition
to fuse wit> the Populists on the electoral
ticket if the Populists will down Watson,
either directly or through a game which
would amount to the same thing.
"The Democrats are trying to play a con
fidence game on us, but I don't think that
orr people will have it," ?aid one of the
best-known members of the Populist party
yesterday.
Another piece of pertinent political wis
dom was uttered yesterday by an active
Democrat of State reputation, who was
heard to say: "Well, our people ought to
fuse for up to three months ago the Demo
cratic party was so dead that it stank, and
if things bad gone a little differently at
Chicago the Populists would have polled
a bigger vote than we would in this
State."
But now that the Populists have # in
dorsed Brvan at their National Conven
tion the Democracy shows a disposition to
consider itself entitled to about every
thing, and to wag the Populist party as
though it wers a rather small tail.
The California Populist is just getting
safely suspicious of the smooth Democrat
who is running a bunko game.

Frazier Mountains, Ventura County. Mr.
Tod has come out to examine it for him
self and British capitalists associated with
him. It is stated that they will buy the
mine and proceed to develop it on an ex
tensive scale.
The gentlemen have just returned from
an examination of the mine. While theie
a cave occurred in the property through
the failure of the workmen to timber the
last seven feet on which they were work
ing. Two men were killed, as has already
been told in a special dispatch to The
Call, and Mr. Koppel's collar-bone was
broken. The fracture was slight, how
ever, and Mr. Koppel was able to get
patched up and has resumed his journey.
Both the visitors were busy receiving
and sending cablegrams last night.
"South Africa is the greatest mining
country in the world," said Mr. Tod last
night. "The country as yet has scarcely
been scratched. I predict in the next few
years greater discoveries by far than has
over been made.
"There are, practically speaking, 30,000
whites in Natal and 600,000 Zulus. The
white population of Pietermaritzbug con
sists of about 700 whites, all the others
being blask. Pietermaritzburg is the
capital of Natal and the headquarters of
the troops.
"I have long been connected with mines
from one end of tbe reef to tbe other, a
distance of thirty-five miles. The Jubilee
mine has long paid a dividend of 120 per
cent a year, and in my opinion will con
tinue to do so for the future. The prop
erty consists of five and three-fourths
claims."
Mr. Tod has been a member of the Town
Council of Pietermaritzburg. He has been
singularly successful as a mining engineer
and has amassed very large wealth.
The gentleman will probably be her*
for several days.
The Swedes In City Polities.
The Swedish-American Political Club
held a well-attended meeting last Wednes
day evening at Pythian Castle, 909 Market
street. The officers of the club are: A.
G. Spencer, president; Joseph Okerblod,
first vice-president; O. A. Clasell, second
vice-president; Alfr>d Johnson, secretary;
Gast. Peterson, treasurer; J. P. 8. Jonn
son, sergeant-at-arms; executive commit
teeâAugust Sjogran, G. S. Turner, P. 0.
Peterson, J. O. Nelson, August Peterson.
Committees on naturalization and en
rolling of members, appointed some time
ago, made very favorable reports. As an
unusual number of Swedes have been nat
uralized this year many new members
have been added to the club, and before
election it will undoubtedly have 700 mem
bers. According to the municipal reports
about 2500 Swedes have been admitted to
citizenship in this city up to July 1, 1896.
At the next meetinz, August 26, the club
will discuss the new charter. Meetings
will be held twice a month until October,
when the club will meet every week.

.THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
DON JUAN RECORD
CAST INTO SHADE,
Tragic Events Occurring at
the Death of G. W.
Cornwell.
HE HAD THEEE WIVES.
Known to Many as Parker and
Died Leaving a Widow
So Named.
HONORED AS AN OLD ENGINEEB
Strange Tale of a M ;n's DupMcity in
Which Several Women Are
Involved.
Don Jnan was elaborated in the brain of
Byron, and the amorous traits ascribed
him were the result of poetic fancy, pure
and simple.
In tne City by the Golden Gate a similar
character has lived in the flesh for years,
and people knew it not. It was only when
the icy hand of Death was laid on his brow
that the attendant circumstances brought
a condition of affairs to light which, from
all accounts, forms a tale of man's duplic
ity strange enough to inspire tne pen of a
Stevenson.
Last Wednesday morning, George W.
Cornwell, the oldest locomotive engineer
on tbe Coast division and one of the best
known engineers of the Southern Pacific
system, died at his home on the corner of
Howard and Erie streets. He was a man
of very quiet disposition, the neighbor's
affirm without exception, and was espe
cially noticeable for kindness of demeanor
toward his wife.
Now the tragic element creeps in. The
name of his wife is Mrs. Parker, and.
moreover, Mrs. Parker supposed and has
supposed for years that Parker was the
name of her husband.
But since his death such strange things
have happened thaUthe poor woman is
uncertain now whether her name is
Parker or Cornwell, whether she was
really the man's legitimate wife or not,
and whether she was not antedated in her
husband's affection? by another woman.
Yes, perhaps by two other women.
Behold, while Parker's shrouded body
rested in its satin-lined coffin a woman
living not a block distant came robed in
widow's weeds and heavily veiled to the
litlie house on the corner of Howard and
Erie streets. She was tne dead man's
wife, she said in pathetic tones, and the
man's name was Cornwell, not Parker.
A stormy scene ensued. Mrs. Parker
wept and indignantly protested tbat such
a thing was impossible, a phantasm of a
disordered brain. The verbal war raged
for some time, but Mrs. Cornwell at length
retired.
In the afternoon she sent Porter and
White, undertakers, whose establishment
on Eddy street, to Mrs Parker's hoase
for tbe body, with instructions to remove
it to her house, near the corner of Howard
and Fourteenth streets. Thgre they ran
against a rival firm of undertakers, Gant
ner & GÂ»nz of City Hall avenue.
The remains were In a fair way for re
moval when a number of Corn well's or
Parker's friends emerged from a neigh
boring grocery-store and rendered such
assistance that tbe Eddy-atreet firm was
forced to capitulate.
On Thursday morning some more com
plications arose, such as to render Mrs.
Parker almost insane from grief. Another
woman, attired in the somber garments of
a widow and known as "The San Jose
widow," her voice trembling with sorrow
and her eyes red and swollen with weep
ing, called at the Howard and Erie resi
dence and in mournful tones asked for a
sight of her dead husband.
Mrs. Parker was in the room when the
inquiry was made, and, throwing up her
hands in sorrow, exclaimed: "My Godl
My God! Where is this to end? He is
my own husband, not yours."
In the afternoon of the same day George
W. Cornwell, for that is the name he was
known to his employers by, was interred
in Cypress Lawn Cemetery under the
auspices of the Locomotive Engineers'
Association. Three women were at the
side of the grave and saw the body laid to
rest. At the hall of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, Sixteenth and
Valencia streets, the "San Jose widow"
made a scene with her manifestations of
grief. The two other women were also
visibly affected. Tbe same sod round the
grave was watered by the tears of the trio.
George W. Cornwell began his career at
the ace of 18 on the New York Central.
In 1860 he came to California and entered
the employ of the Central Pacific. At the
completion of the Ban Jose and Monterey
road he was employed as engineer, and
continued in the company's service till he
died.
To bis associates he was known as "Old
Pard." He was a pallbearer both at the
funeral of Leland Stanford and A. N.
Towne. His was the engine, No. 14SI,
selected to pull the special train which
conveyed President Harrison over the
roads Of the system when he visited this
coast.
According to Mrs. Cornwell, the woman
who lives at 1802 Howard street, after
Cornwall came to this coast be became en
amored of a woman living on Dupont
street, the one now known ns the >'San Jose
widow." He lived with her until 1872,
when he married her. Bhe says their
married Ufa was happy till 1888, at which
time he met Mrs. Parker, a beautiful
woman.
Iheu he neglected her and a separation
was found unavoidable, though no divorce
took place. She has since, she asserts, re
ceived $25 a month for support from him.
The theory advanced by Mrs. Corn well
for her husband's taking the name of
Parker was to avoid her and the "San
Jose widow" while living as the husband
of Mrs. Parker, who had gone through the
marriage ceremony with him.
While Mrs. Cornwell lived only a block
away from Mrs. Parker she did not know
tbat her husband waÃ Mrs. Parker's hus
band.
"It stems impossible," she sobbed. "I
cannot believe it. Still it would have been
very easy for him to do it even before we
were separated. He could have claimed
tbat he had extra runs and bad to work
overtime. This always pleases an engi
neer's wife, for it means more money
when the paycar come* round."

SIR DONALD CURRIE.
He Is the Head of a Famous Ocean
Line of Steamers.
The loss of the Drnmmond Castle, one
of the finest of the Castle liners, with nearly
all the passengers and crew, is a disaster
the like of which has never before been
experienced by the well-known company
of which Sir Donald is the head. Indeed,
it is stated that this famous fleet of vessels,
in all the twenty-one years of its service
between London and the Cape, had
hitherto never sustained any loss of life
by accident at aea. Soon after the com
pany started an accident occurred to the
Windsor Castle, but happily no lives were
lost.
Sir Donald Currie, K.C. M. G., M. P., is in
the seventy-first year of his age. He is deep
ly interested in all Sonth African affairs
and in most South African ventures. His
company rendered great assistance to tne
Government in its South African troubles
in the supply of steamships for tbe quick
conveyance of troops and stores ; and Sir
Donald himself was made a C. M. G. in 1877
for the part he took in the settlement of the
Diamond Fields dispute and the Orange
Free State boundary, and a K. C. M. G.
in 1881 for assistance afforded to the ex
pedition for the relief of Ekowe.
He has, as is well known, on two or
three occasions materially contributed to
the restoration of Mr. Gladstone to health
by taking the "Grand Old Man" on sea
voyages on board of one of his Swift and
luxurious steamers, and comparatively re
cently conducted the G. O. M. on the Tan
tallon Castle to the opening of the Kaiser
Wilhelm canal. Bince 1880 he has repre
sented Perthshire in the House of Com
mons.
The Empress of China, who rales over
hundreds of millions of subjects, is only 24
years of age.

TO NEW YORK
IN FORTY HOURS,
An Aerial Navigation Com
pany Is Incorpo
rated.
DR. SMITH'S INVENTION.
Airships to Be Built of Alum
num and Lifted by
Hydrogen Gas.
CARRY MORE THAK TWO TONS,
Will Pass Over the Continent at a
Terrific Rate and With Per
fect Safety.
Dr. Charles Abbott Bmith of this City
believes he has met and overcome all the
demands necessary for a vehicle that may
saiely and successfully navigate tbe air.
The airship designed by Dr. Smith is to
be composed of aluminum and will be
lifted by hydiogen gas.
The machinery required to work the dif
ferent portions of the ship's apparatus is
all in practical use to-day In the work
shops of the world.
The inventor has prescribed an equitable
plan whereby sufficient working capital
will be supplied to insure all the stock
company. The number of shares already
set apart and under bond for the working
fund is 85,000 ; this is nearly one-tenth of
the number of shares of the capital stock.
The company has been called the Atlantic
and Pacific Aerial Navigation Company,
incorporated August 10, 1896. The direct
ors are I. J. Truman, G. T. Gaden, Dr. C.
A. Smith, Edward Foster and M. A.
Terry. M. M. Estee is the company's
attorney.
The present office of the company is in
tbe Mills building.
It is contemplated to build a ship of two
tons burden and it is expected to traverse
the continent from San Francisco to New
York in the remarkably short time of
forty hours.
The ship will be cylindrical in shape,
120 feet long and 39 feet in diameter. The
gas capacity of a shin of this length will
be 89,000 cubic feet; this will give a lifting
power of 6230 pounds.
The total weight of the machine is 2053
pounds, thus leaving 4173 pounds extra
the ship can carry of dead weight. Ships
may be made larger or smaller at option;
the cargo may be passengers, mail matter
or express.
The requirements usually set forth for a
successful airship are: First, buoyancy;
second, power to move at will in either
horizontal or vertical, directions, and
third, tbe ability to land without injury
to passengers or ship.
The airship's ability to rise has been
described. Its steering apparatus consists
of a large horizontal rudder, hinged to the
rear end of the vessel, which being ele
vated or lowered will cause a correspond
ing direction of the vessel's bow. Vertical
rudders will act on the atmosphere in like
manner, causing a side movement.
The third difficulty, that of easy alight
ing and safety, is overcome by the use of
immense wings, the horizontal rudder or
tall and the propeller which gives the
motive power. The broad propeller is to
be run at such a speed as may be neces
sary to force tbe machine forward against
the air as it presses upon the deflected
wings, tbe final result produced by the
three portions of tbe machinery working
in unison will be the settling down of the
ship after its aerial journey into the slip
prepared for its reception.
It is the desire of the company to secure
the co-operation of a number of private
citizens; fr.m this body may be selected
nien who ari financially interested in the
concern to such an extent as will qualify
them to take positions with and transact
business for the company. This is intended
so that no capitalist may obtain control of
the company.
A limited number of shares will be sold
until after the building of the first ship.
The projectors of the undertaking say
there will be levied no assessments.
The City's Creditors.
A meeting of the creditors of the City and
County of San Francisco will be held at the
rooms of the Board of Trade, 202 Market
street, to-morrow at 2:30 p.m. According to
the announcement of the chairman, the meet
ing is called for the purpose of presenting and
receiving suggestions of new methods of satis
fying the demands of the creditors of the City.
The outline of a new plan of action will be
presented.

ABLY DEFENDED,
Views of the Hon. Charles
N. Potter of Wyom
ing.
ON TRIAL FOR YEARS.
The Eminent Supreme Court
Justice Tells What He
Has Seen.
BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE.
Succinct Resume of the Practical
Results Attained by Political
Equality.
Among recent visitors at tbe Woman
Suffrage Bureau none made himself more
welcome than the Hon. Charles N. Potter,
one of the most distinguished jurists of
Officers of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Veteran Republican Club Who Have Been Elected for
the Ensuing Tear.
Cheyenne and at present a Justice of the
Supreme Court of "Wyoming. His Honor
is an uncompromising woman suffragist,
and, while not given to glittering out
bursts of wordy enthusiffem, is always
ready to voice his views with no uncertain
sound.
"As everybody knows," he remarked,
"women in Wyoming have had the right
to vote since 1869, and, although that
frightful bugaboo of the Miti-suffragists,
the 'unsexed' voting creature, is all we
can boast of in the way of female citizens,
I, for one, am more than willing to see
the ladies of Wyoming compared with any
in the world.
"Woman suffrageâ l speak particulurly
for Wyoming â nas been long and carefully
weighed in the balance, and not found
wanting. At the time of rhe adoption of
tne State constitution in 1890 woman suf
frage had, so to speak, attained its ma
"For over twenty years it had been tried,
and it was seen and proved beyond ail
cavil that it worked and worked splen
didly. The elective franchise was con
firmed to women by constitutional enact
ment, which was adopted with only one
poor, forlorn, little dissenting vote.
"There is practically no opposition to
woman suffrage in Wyoming. The re
sults of its adoption have proved in the
highest decree beneficial, and if any one
wanted to kick aguinst it the kick would
only stub the kicker's toe. Women, as a
rile. vote at all the elections in at least
the same proDonion esmen. Independent
and unhampered, they vote freely and in
telligently, though, like the men, they
have their party affiliations and prefer
ences. Their interest in governmental as
well as local politics is active and con
stant. To be sure, in many instances,
husband and wife think alike politically,
but I have never heard of an* coercion in
the matter being exercised by the bus
band. Frequently the wife has come
from some other State, where she could
have had no political experience. In such
cases the wife often gets her first lessons
in politics from her husband and .event
ually espouses the principles aavocated by
him.
"But in many other families the hus
band and wife entertain different political
ideas and vote differently, and. although
I am familiar with some instances of that
character, I know of no case and have
heard of none where it has caused any
difficulty or disturbance in the family,
and I am quite sure if there had been, it
would have come to my knowledge. The
women, as a class, ere not office-seekers.
They have held no office in our State oat-
Bide of those which are connected with
public-school work, such as Superintend
ent of Schools. At present the State Su
perintendent of Public Instruction is a
woman, and, ex-officio, she is a member
of several of the State boards, viz.: those
which control the character and disposi
tion of public lands, and the charitable
and penal institutions of the State.
"Candidates of known bad or impure
character do not fare well at the hands of
the ladies of Wyoming. This is a fact
recognized by all the political parties, and
results in better nominations for public
office than might otherwise be the case. I
believe this to be one of the beneficial re
sults of woman sntlrage. Dishonesty in
public office is of rare occurrence in Wyom
ing. I have been askei miny .times
whether the fact that women of oad char
acter possess the right of suffrage does not
counteract the benefits which might ac
crue from the exercise of the frar. hise by
the better class of women. But in Wyom
ing no large a proportion of the better class
ol women vote that they greatly outnum
ber the worse element, nor have I found
that the latter is always controlled by
those who are in the interest of the impure
or undesirable in politics.
"It has not been our experience that the
exercise of the franchise interferes with
woman's domestic duties in any way, nor
does it detract from her modesty, char
acter or reputation. Women are as much
respected in Wyoming as anywhere in the
world. I believe that politics are purer,
that the conduct of the people around the
polls is more orderly than would be the
case if women did not vote. When they
visit the polls they are not met by any in
eults and as much respect is paid to them
on auch occasions as at any other public
place; if not more. lam thoroughly con
vinced that there is nothing connected
with the exercise of the franchise which is
degrading in the slightest degree, but
there is much about it which has a ten
dency to afford women a broader view of
life, and I am sure that if generally
adopted throughout the United States it
would have the effect of making t&e politi
cal atmosphere of the entire country much
purer and less open to suspicion of wrong
influences and corrupt methods."
LADY DAY AT CHICAGO.
Many Thousands ot Erin's Sons and
Daughters Celebrate the Event in
the Parks of the City.
CHICAGO, 111.. Aug. 15.â The twentieth
annual celebration of "lady day" by the
Irish societies of this city caused an exo
dus this morning to two Darks on the out
skirts of between. 40,000 and 50,000 sons
and daughters of Erin's Isle. Tbe con
federated Irish societies or anti-machine
wing held forth at Electric Park, where
over 25,000 people had gathered.
The lion of the occasion was Edward
O'Meagher Condon of New York, one of
the five men convicted of the murder of
Sergeant Brett in the famous Manchester
Fenian melee in 1867 and who with Allen,
Larkin and O'Brien was sentenced to
death, but was afterward pardoned as a
result of the representations made by the
American Government through Minister
Lowell, Condon being an American citisen
at the time, the claim that he did not
receive a fair trial being substantiated.
Another speaker was Recorder John W.
Goff of New York Lexow fame, who it is
not generally known is a Fenian veteran
and was a participator in the memorable
Catalpa rescue.
The demonstration of the United Irish
Societies was held at Ogden's Grove, and
took the form of a demand for the 'release
of the imprisoned Irish patriatsand polit-
ical prisoners in England. An address to
tbe Irish people of the Republic on this
question was read. Rev. Daniel J. O'Brien
was chairman of ths meeting and Attor
ney-General Moloney and M. J. Doyle of
Menominee, Mich., were the principal
speakers.
FATALE JOGUES' SARINE.
Special Pilgrimage of Several Thousand
Hastrrn Catholics.
AUEIESVILLE, N. V., Aug. 15.-Early
next month occurs the two hundred and
fiftieth anniversary of the assassination of
the famous Jesuit missionary, Father
Isaac Joijues. The event has yearly been
observed by the Catholics of the East in
connection with feast of Our Lady of
Martyrs, and to-day there was a special
pilgrimage to the shrine by several thou
sand Catholics of this city, and from New
Jersey and Philadelphia. Mass will be
celebrated to-morrow by Father O. B.
Pardee, provincial oÂ£ the Jesuits of the
Eastern States. Next week at the shrine
will occur tbe unveiling of a crown for the
statue of the Virgin, composed of dia
monds and other precious stones, rings,
watches and jewelry, contributed by
Catholics throughout the country, many
of the gifts being heirlooms and memen
tos. Ii is the most magnificent crown in
this country. Leading Catholics in this
city arts daily expecting an intimation
from Rome thattie Holy Father has an
nonuced the beatification of Father Jogues,
and which will be the preliminary toward
declaring the martyr a saint.
CLIFF HAGEY IN JAIL.
Charged With the Murder of W. V. Eisler
at Lincoln, Xebr.
LINCOLN, Nebe., Aug. 15.â Cliff Hagey,
the man charged with the murder of W.
F. Eisler, the wealthy Chambersburg, Pa.,
man found dean in an alley late last night,
is in the city jail along with Milton Mc-
Cord, a saloon loafer, and four women of
the town, who are charged as accom
plices. Hagey, who was last seen with
Eisler last night, but who eluded the
police, was captured this afternoon while
hiding in a brusbheap on a farm near
Valparaiso, twenty miles from here.
Mayor Graham and Chief of Police Me
lick made the arrest and brought the
prisoner to Lincoln. He refuses to talk
further than to assert his innocence. The
poli ce are firmly convinced that Eiaiei
was drugged and robbed, either in a
saloon or at the disorderly house which
lie and Hagey visited, and his body car
ried to the alley where found. An in
quest was begun this afternoon, but has
not been concluded,

UPHOLD THE PARTY'S CHOICE.
A Society That Seems Destined to
Have Much Influence in the
Coming Campaign.
Tbe old veteran F. W. Whiteside, the
grand man who gave proof of his patriot
ism by offering his life that his country
might remain one Nation, the man who
left his home when the sainted Lincoln
called for volunteers that Old Gloiy might
not wave over a divided people, makes his
presence felt among the American people
once more. But this time he appears not
in the uniform of Uncle Sam's soldier, but
in the ordinary guise of an American citi
zen organizing a Republican club in the
interest of his former comrade, Major
William McKinley, who in the trials and
tribulations of a great Nation shouldered
his musket and took his place in tbe trench
to repel the attacks of a domestic foe.
To place this comrade as Commander
in-chief at the head of the army and navy
that knows no such thing as defeat is the
object of the Veteran Soldiers' and Sailors'
Republican Club, which has been organ
ized for the coming campaign, with bead
quarters at 113 Turk street, where tne first
meeting had been held on last Friday
evening. The organization is composed
of ex-Union and Mexican veterans. It
was created in June, 1892, for a twofold
purpose â first, to further the election of
BeEjainin Harrison, and, second* to work
for the purification of municipal politics.
While the ciub is strictly a veteran organ
ization, it has an honorary roll, and on the
list will be found many citizens prom
inent in the Republican party who have
been elected to hiirh office because of their
affiliation with this club.
An incident worth mentioning occurred
a few years ago, when a well-known Re
publican, who bad obtained the nomina
tion for a very lucrative office, was ap
proached by a committee from the
Soldiers' Club and asked whether if he
were elected he would recognize the old
soldiers. His answer was:
"You fellows can't help yourselves.
You must vote the Republican ticket."
Suffice to say that this independent man
remained home and has not since that
time dabbled in politics.
While nominally the club in this City
is a separate organization, it is in com
munion with kindred cluds throughout
the State, and when aroused to action
commands a power and an influence not
to be underrated.
Its present officers are Fergus Hanson,
president; Frank W, Whitedide, vice
president; W. B. Maydwell, second vice
president; E. P. Morew secretary; L. D.
Olin, treasurer, and u'Washburn, finan
cial secretary.
The president, F. Hanson, who was
Market Inspector under the Republican
administration previous to the present
Democratic one, has left a grand record.
The first vice-president, Franklin W.
Whiteside, is a brother of Major White
side, who has so prominently figured in
Republican organizations in this City.
Both are intimate acquaintances of Major
McKinley, having been born in the same
section of Ohio as the great statesman.
As an organizer ani a shrewd wide
awake politician F. \V. Whiteside has
very few superiors in or out of the club.
Financial Secretary L. Washburn. who
has been re-elected for the fourth time to
the office, is a man in everjvway fitted
not only for the place he occupies, but for
any other where education is a qualifica
tion. The same may be said of the other
officers of the club. Weekly meetings
will be held at the headquarters until the
day of the election, and nothing will be
left undone by the members to secure the
election of McKinley and Hotmrt.
REPUBLICAN BATTLE CRY.
B'tter to Open Mills to American Labor
Than Miuli to Stiver.
CHICAGO. 111., Aug. 15.â Chairman
Hanna finished his week's political work
to-night, and lelt the city at 8:45 o'clock
for Cleveland. Before ieavine Mr. Hanna
said to a reporter for the United Asso
ciated Press:
"I am very well satisfied with the pre
liminary organization. The results will
be beneficial to the cause in all the twenty
seven States under the western jurisdic
tion. For the rest cf this month the cam
paign will be conducted along lines of edu
cation. About September Iwe will open
up all along the line with speakers and
make an aggressive campaign. From ail
the reports I have received within the
week I can say the situation in the Middle
Western States, the battle ground, is ex
cellent lor our success."
When Mr. Hanna was asked what the
party battle-cry would be, he was antici
pated by Mr. "Payne, who offered Major
M cKinley's utterance this week at Canton :
"It is better to open tbe mills to the labor
of the United States, than to open the
mints of the United States to the silver of
the world." Mr. Hanna said it was just
the thing, and added that 100,000 copies
of the Major's speeches were being printed
in Canton for general distribution.
DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNERS.
Senator Jones Mantes the Leaders of the
Silver Fight.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 15.â This
evening Chairman Jones gave out the fol
lowing:
"The headquarters of the National Dem
ocratic Committee will be established at
Chicago, with a branch in Washington
City.
"A part of the campaign committee,
sufficient to conduct the business of the
campaign for the present, has been ap
pointed.
"The gentlemen selected so far are John
R. McLean, Ohio: D. J. Campau, Michi
gan; D. J- Johnson, Kansas; CJark
Howpll, Georgia; B. B. Smalley, Vermont,
and Thomas Gahan, Illinois. J. L. Norris
has also been selected as assistant treas
urer of the Democratic Notional Commit
tee, located at Washington. Other ap
pointments will be made as occasion
requires. The executive committee will
be appointed later.
"Mr. Gorman was requested to accept a
place on the campaign committee. He
declined because of the selection of
Chicago, as he could not very well go so
far from his own State. He will, as a
member of the National Committee, en
gage actively in the campaign, especially
in his own and neighboring States."
CLOSED UNTIL ELECTION.
Indiana Bicycle Works Afraid of the
Money Question.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 15.â The
Indiana Bicycle Works, the largest of the
kind in the world, employing 1500 men
when running full handed, shut down to
day until after the election. Charles F.
Smith, president of the company said in
giving reasons for closing:
"The uncertainty of the future is a suffi
cient cause. We have $500,000 out now
and we want to know what we are to real
ize on that before we put more money, at
the present value, into stock. It is ordi
nary business sense and not politics that
causes us to suspend work until we know
what the result of the election is to be.
"We cannot risk further manufacturing
until the monetary contest is settled. If
it is determined to maintain the sound
ness of the present value of our money at
the polls those who are hoarding it will

Waited Until Sight to Make a Pyro
technic Speech and Was Put - â¬hit.
OTTUMWA, lowa, Aug. 15.â The cam
paign opening here to-day was not such a
portentous event as the Republicans
hoped for, that fact being due to the
heavy rain which fell this morning when
tbe people who live in .the country were
supposed to start for Ottumwa. â 
The speaker of the day was Hon. John
M. Thurston of Nebraska. G. L. Dobson,
Republican candidate for. Secretary of
State, who was on the stand, reserved his
eloquence for to-night's meeting and was
rained on. . i , ;
Senator Thurston's address was a plea !
for sound money, and the crowd cheered
nearly, every remark touching on that
subject. In early 15,000 Bound-money ad
vocates took part in the parade. -

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 15.â Lord

PRICE $5 AND UPWARD.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT IS NOT A CHEAP BELT. NO BELT
' made as well as it is made can be sold cheaply. It is perhaps the highest-priced
Electric Belt in the world, because it is the best; and yet it is sold as low as $5,
and at this price is warranted far superior to any other Electric Belt made. Dr. San-
den's $10, $15 and $20 Belts have all the latest improvemen ts known to science. Every
Dr. Sanden Electric Belt is Guaranteed for one year, and $5000 will be forfeited , for one
which will not generate a current of electricity strong enough to be felt by the wearer,
as soon as placed on the body. â ' ; ..:.(."..' -' â  â  - '" :^' .;
y; Compared with the cost of drugs or doctor bills this famous Electric â  Belt, which
has done so much good service, is very cheap. Five 'dollars invested in this way will 1
be worth ten timesâ aye, a hundred timesâ more than the same amount in medicine;

FATAL RAILWAY WRECK,
Engineer and Fireman Kilted
and Twenty Passengers
Irjured.
The Disaster Supposed to Have Been
Caused by the Intense H-at Spread
ing the Rails.
PUEBLO, Colo., Aug. 15.â The second
section of train No. 1, west bound, of the
Denver and Rio Grande, was wrecked
eight miles west of Pneblo, about 1 o'clock
this aiternoon. The special was mado up
of an engine, dead coach and three tour
ist sleepers, and wa3 occupied by a party
of Judson excursionists who came in this
morning over the Missouri Pacific and
Rock Island roads. The train contained
about seventy passengers. Near the litle
station of Vegas the train left the track
and the engine turned completely over.
Engineer Charles E. Davenport of
Pueblo, aged 40, and Fireman William F.
Reppert of Burlington, lowa, aged 25,
were instantly killed. Davenport has a
wife and four children in this city. Rep
pert wae unmarried. About twenty pas
sengers were injured, but none seriously,
the injuries being confined mostly to
bruises and cuts.
It Is the opinion of railroad men here
that the accident was caused by spreading
rails, due to the intense heat. This has
been an extremely hot day in this vicin
ity, and the thermometer has registered
102 degrees in the shade.
SPAIN WANTS RECOMPENSE.
Will Demand Damages for American
J- ilibu'tertwr Excursions.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 15.â A Herald
special from Washington says: Spain is
preparing to present a heavy bill for dam
ages against the United States on account
of the operations of Cuban filibustering
expeditions.
Calderon Carlisle, the legal adviser of
the Spanish legation, has just submitted
to Senor de Lome, by his direc
tion, a voluminous report on "the
legal aspect of hostilities committed
by vessels especially adapted wholly or in
part in the United States for warlike
usages and by military expeditions and
enterprises carried on from the territory
of the United States against the Spanish
dominion in Cuba during the present in
surrection."
The report is accompanied by five ap
pendices, citing proclamations of the
President, the laws of the United States
and the judicial proceedines bearing on
the subject. The whole makes a book of
180 closely printed pages.

The Parts Exposition.
For the exposition of 1900 pains will be
taken to make Paris more attractive than
ever, and in the plans every effort is turned
to making as many permanent improve
ments as possible. There will be public
parks, gardens and squares created in all
parts of the city, lor example at St.
Philippe dv Roule and in the St. Mar
guerite quarter. Rows of trees will be
planted at the Place de Rennes, and tne
banks of the Canal St. Martin will be cov
ered with tarf. The rows of tref.s in the
Champs Elysees will be doubled, and still
more trees will be planted in the Avenue
de Bois dt> Boulogne. The roads leading
into the Bois from ttui Auteuil side will be
arranged in terraces covered with flowers,
and overlooking the valley of the Seine.
The park and the gardens on the Butte
Montmartre will be finished by that time.
At night the city will be brilliantly illu
minated by an extensive system of electric
lights as far as the outer boulevards and
including the Bois de Boulogne and De
Vincennes.â New York Sun.
NIKE BUILDINGS
TO BE DESTROYED.
The Board of Health Con
demns Chinatown
Rookeries.
NOTIFIED TO VACATE.
Occupants Must Remove Their
Eff.cts Within the Next
Ten Days.
POLICE AND FIREMEN TO AID.
The Chinese Consul Is Asked to Co
operate in Cleansing the
Filthy Quarter.
The Board of Health took the Chins
town bull by the horns at the meeting held
yesterday and decided to condemn and
tear down nine of the tottering and ill
smelling rookeries that were inspected and
marked for destruction during Friday's
tpur of the Chinese quarter.
After disposing of a n amber of minor
matters the Chinatown nuisances were
brought up.
Health Officer Lovelace submitted the
following list of buildings that he certified
were nuisances to the public health and
and should be torn down without delay:
No. 8% Brooklyn place, between Dupont
and Stockton and Sacramento and
streets; two-story dwelling used lor immoral
purposes; rooms are damp, filthy and unven
tilated; no water supply and no watercloset;
Chinese use roof for drying clothes; building
in danger of falling down. Joseph Cuneo,
owner.

down by props; very filthy and damp, and
most of the rooms dark. Joseph Cuneo, owner.
Rear of 719 Jackson street; one story dwell

sons; rooms dark, filthy and unveutllated ; no

dated sheds. L. Geisberger, owner.

Stockton and Sacramento and California

tions and the three rooms are occupied by six

connections. B. Brijrnoii, owner.
No. 710 Pacific street, between Dupont and
Stockton; lodging-house, one story and four

la an advanced stage of. decay. Hugh Morri
son, owner.
Nos. 741 and 743 Pacific street, between Du
pont and Stockton; two-story wooden build
ing with sheds adjoining and space under
neath used as a stable; occupied by twenty
three persons, consisting of nix families, in
cluding ten children under 12 years of age;
there are thirteen or more rooms, seven of

tire building is in an advanced stage of decay.
Albert O Larkin, owner.
No. 708 Pacific street, between Dupont and
Stockton, used, for immoral purposes and oo
cupled by thirteen persons; wooden partitions
old and rotten and not ht for occupancy.
No. 832 Jackson street, between Dupont and
Stockton, occupied as a tenement, carpenter
shop and leather manufactory ; surrounded
by wooden shanties; buildings are about ready
to fall and premises are filthy. M. Schuppert,
owner.
The board took the report up in detail,
the first building considered being the one
at $14 Brooklyn place.
All were familiar with its condition, and
Dr. Hart moved that it be condemned as a
nuisance and the owner be notified to tear
it down within ten days.
"Suppose he don't tear it down?" asked
Dr. Fi'tzgibbon.
"Then we'll tear it down for him," re
turned Hart.
"But have we the power to do so?"
"Well, we believe we have," said Chair
man Morse. "Anyway, we'll test our
power.''
The other buildings were condemned in
rapid succession, the entire report being
approved. Should this raid go through
without hindrance others will follow in
rapid succession until the quarter is in at
least fair sanitary condition.
Secretary Godcbaux was instructed to
send a communication to the Chinese
Consul notifying him of the action of the
board. This letter was in part as fol
lows:
To the Honorable, the Chinese Consul, San
Francisco; CaLâ Dear Sir: We beg to inform
you that in the performance of our duty under
the laws of this State, we have been obliged
to declare the buildings and premises de
scribed in the accompanying list unfit for
human occupation and a menace to life and
health in this community.
We have notified the owners and tenants of
said premises that the occupants must remove
therefrom within ten days trom this date, and
we request your good offices in the eniorce
ment of this order, at least to the extent that
you shall inform all Chinese occupants of the
reasons on which our action is based, and the
further fact that they must vacate tne premises
within that time, and that such premises will
be destroyed in all probability.
And as "you are charged with the duty of
ministering to the welfare of the Chinese, and
we with the duty of preserving the health of
all the inhabitants oi this City alike we nÂ«k
your aid in the inf orcement of such of our acts
as will prevent either the greed of owuers or
the carelessness of the occupants in the Chi
nese quarter from imnsing about such condi
tions as are a menace to liie and health there
and everywhere in this City.
Though neither Chief Crowley of the
Police Department or Cnief Sullivan of the
Fire Department will take any active part
in the wrecking of the rookeries it is un
derstood that they will furnish the board
the necessary men and wrecking appar
atus, the responsibility to rest entirely ou
the health authorities.
Kruger'a Dog Story Told Straight.
The true account of .President Kruger'a
recent canine analogy is too good to be
lost. When the reformers called upon
him and began to thank him for their
release the old man looked at them
for a moment and then said, iron
ically: "Some Uogs which h.tve been
beaten lick the feet of their master. Others
slink away and snarl and try to bite again.
I hope you are not going to snarl any
more." There was a painful pause, broken
at length by a loud eurfaw, as the Presi
dent turned to the interpreter and said:
"You needn't translate that; it's only my
little joke."
His Honor resumed in the terms already
summarized here: "You have asked ma
to be merciful to the remaining prisoners,
and I will answer you in a parable: There
was once a naughty little dog, and it was
beaten. It was right to beat that dog, be
cause it was naughty. But what should
be done to the owner of that dog, who
stood by and said 'Saa?' "
Then, dropping the parable, the Presi
dent exclaimed: "Rhodes is the owner of
thatdo'.! VVhat Biiall be done to him?"
The deputation rather looked as though,
in the popular phrase, they would like to
be asted another. â Cape Times.

MAY BE A LOOP SYSTEM.
The Trains M,y Run Through Oak

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aujr. 15. j
Within a few weeks it is probable that
there will be some marted changes in tbe
method of junning tde Oakland and Ala
meda broad-gauge local trains. Such is
the statement made by one of the railroad
officials in the Encinal City during the
past week. This may account for the new
depot being constructed at the intersec
tion of the Seventh-street line from Oak
land and the Laundry Farm road.
The gentleman in speaking of the pro
posed change said: "Gates will be in
place upon the Alameda cars by Septem
ber 1. No fares are to be charged, but the
public will be required to show their
tickets before entering the cars. It is the
intention to run the trains to Fruitvale."
At present the Seventh-street local in
this city terminates at Fruitvale and the
Alameda line at Park street. The build
ing of the new station out at High street,
â¢where tbe Laundry electric line crosses the
main line of the Southern Paciric, is be
lieved to be a part of. the new plan, as all
trains can be run to that point via either
route.
Free rides through Alameda will be dis
pensed with at that time. The running of
the trains to Fruitvale or High street will
be for the pnrpose of passing outside of
the limits of Alameda. Then tickets can
be sold to Fruitvale one way and to Oak
land the other, as now dove in this city.
For years past the railroad company
have been planning to get their trains
into and out of tiie mole on a loop in
order to escape the loss of time in switch
ing. The new move as to Alameda is now
looked upon as a partial carrying out of
the scheme. It is hinted that the trains
may run out through Oakland past Fruit
vale to Alameda to the mole and vie
versa, making all but a loop. It would
take no more trains than are now running
and would give Alameda additional ser
vice. At present the Alameda local only
runs hourly during tne middle of tbe day.
A continuous run would give it a half
hourly service.
PLAN OF A TYPEWRITER.
She Expects to Earn the Ex
penses of a College
Education.
May Burdick's Brave Plan â Professors
and Business M^n Are Inter.
estid in Her.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 15. -May Bur
ciick has arrived in Berkeley with $50 and
a typewriter and announces her intention
to enter the university ana graduate with
the class of 1900. The young lady has no
resources other than her small capital and
a determination that admits no possibility
of defeat, but she will not allow that there
is a doubt about her ability to maintain
herself at college.
Misa Burdick is a graduate of the Cen
terville High School. She is staying with
Mrs. Gilbert on College way. A number
of friends who have become interested in
her Drave programme have helped her in
starting on her college career and already
a good deal of work as typewriter has been
sent to her.
Members of the faculty and local busi
ness men have become concerned for the
success of such brave enterprise and are
saving their work for the courageous
young lady, 80 that there is a good pros
pect that she will succeed. She will do
her own cooking and live wholly by her
own efforts in the room that she has
rented.
Miss Burdick's capital to start with iS
not enough to buy the books she will need
and pay her matriculation expenses. The
task she has set before herself is, there
fore, that of earning her entire expenses
for four years of college life and at the
same time pursuing the studies of a full
university course, often declared. to be too
much for a woman who can give her
whole time to it.
The young lady is quite cheerful over
the prospect before her. "I have come to
Berkeley to enter the university," said
she, "and I shall certainly stay." The
general impression among tho.^e who
know her is that ahe will keep her word.

Reasons "Why an Old Pensioner Refuse*
to Vote or Acknowledge His
Country.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 15.â David
Story told a peculiar story this afternoon
when asked to vote at tbe primary by one
of tbe carriage-drivers. Story lives in a
little hut by the side of Lake Merritt, near
the end of Harrison street. He built his
house on tbe material that drifted ashore,
and gathered tbe lumber of which he
built it.
"I live on no man's land," said Story,
"and I owe allegiance to no country. I
was injured during the war, anil when I
applied for a bonus I was unable to
get it.
"I was gaanted a pension, and still re
ceive it: but I was entitled to a bonus for
extraordinary bravery and 1 was refused,
ana since then I have not voted and do
not intend to vote again. I own this
piece of land and hut in which I live, as
it was washed ashore by nature, and no
body can claim it."
Story is an interesting old man, but
nothing can persuade him to vote.

An Ovation Was Tendered to the Win

heaviest vote ever polled. Immense in
terest was displayed all over the city and
HON. S, G, HILBORN, Who Will Be Nominated to Succeed
Himself by the Third District Congressional Convention,
"Which Assembles at Vallejo Next Tuesday.
j nosts of workers were out all day with
| buggies and rips running in voters.
Everything was conducted in an orderly
manner and little scratching was resorted
to. The votes polled at West End for
Hilborn were 130, Frick 120; Park streetâ
Hilborn 171, Frick 150; Encinal avenueâ
Hilborn 257, Frick 148; Bay streetâHil
born 150, Frick 245. Total votes cast 13S0.
Majority, Hilborn 58.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 15.âCongress
man S. G. Hilborn will have an over
whelming majority in the Third District
Convention. His delegates were elected
in nearly every precinct in this county.
The polls closed at 8 o'clock and ten
minutes later the partial returns from
outlying townships showed that Hilborn's
ticket was leading. The indications never
altered, and after the complete vote was
received it added to Hilborn'a majority.
The fight throughout has been one of
those illusive strticrxles very common in
this county. On every street corner and
in all the places where men usually gather
friends and workers for Frick have been in
evidence for weeks. His prospects have
been discussed and his claims advocated,
while very little has been heard of Hil
born.
Very quiet but, very systematic, has
been the campaign waged by Hil
born, bat it has been aajrres^ive
and the completeness and effective
ness of it have been amply demon
strated. The politicians on Loth sides ex
press surprise at the result. Fries man
agers express surprise at the sraallness of
his vote compared with the indications,
and Hilbqrn's friends are surprised that
his majority was not larger. One notable
feature of the fieht is the large number of
men who were out working For Frick and
who were thought to be firm Hilborn
men. Among these are H. H. North, W.
H. Chickering, E. P. Vaudercook, A. J. C.
Adney and many others who would deny
it if they saw their names in print, but
who, nevertheless, worked hard against
Hilborn.
Frick carried the First.Sixth and Fourth
wards in the city, but on the outside he
was everywhere unsuccessful. Alameda
returned a majority of 58 votes in favor of
the Hilborn delegates.
Had Judge Frick's campaign been as
effective in the country as in the city of
Oakland he would have been more suc
cessful, but a glance at the returns shows
conclusively that Hilborn is too powerlul
toovercom â¢ at this time.
The primary may also be said to terrnin
| ate tbe long-drawn-out struggle between
I the two Congressional committees. The
"friend" committee will dominate the
convention, and will be in power for the
next two years. The complete vote for
Oakland city is as follows:
First Wardâ Hilborn 339, Krick 648
Second WardVHilborn 546, Frick 429
Third Wardâ Hilborn 472, Frick 335. '
Fourth Wfiidâ Hilborn 133, Frick 184
Fifth Wardâ Hilborn 405, Frick 252
Sixth Wardâ Hilborn 296, Frirk 421.
Seventh Wardâ Hilborn 752, Frick 388.
The vote in Alameda was: Hilborn 669
Frick 611. Oakland, Brooklyn, Washing!
ton, Murray and Eden townships elected
Hilborn delegates.
Hilborn was indorsed by the Contra
Costa Convention to-day and has nine
delegates from that county.
The complexion of tbe Third District
convention when it is called to order will
be, as near as can be determined ct this
time, Hilborn 63, Frick 21.
Wnen tbe result was made known a
delegation started out to find Mr. Hilborn.
He was located in the Enquirer office and
a larce crowd quickly gathered and de
manded a speech. He was lifted on the
counter and in a short speech he referred
to the bitter fight tbat had been waged
against him and thanked the crowd.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 15.â Returns

AT THE POLLS.
More Life and Pubic Interest
Shown Than In Any Primary
for Four Years.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 15. â To-day's
primary marks a revival of politics. It
was a genuine old-time Alameda County
Republican primary. It was not one whit
Jess enthusiastic or devoid of general in
terest than the celebrated primary of lour
years ago, when W. E. Dargie and Guy
Earl opposed each other for the nomina
tion of State Senator.
Carriages were out, stranee faces were at
every polling booth, and anybody who was
hungry or thirsty was foolish.
The politicians did not sleep last night.
When the interview was published from
Senator Perkins, in which he was made to
say that he indorsed Hilborn, a new feat
ure was thrown into the h'sht. The Sen
ator was visited by Frick's friends and
was reminded of his frequent remarks to
the effect that a younger man should be
sent to Washington, and tilso that, by bis
secretary's suggestion, Frick was put in
the hgftt. Eli Denison was particularly
angry and said tnat only yesterday at the
Palace Hotel Senator Perkins had said
that a younger man than Hilborn should
be nominated.
There was much bitterness expressed by
Frick's friends over the actions of Senator
Perkins, and it would not be surprising if
| to-day's primary should have its sequel in
I the next State Legislature.
Around the County Committee head
' quarters there was a crowd all night, and
lit did not seem to dimish till noon. From
j tbat hour till 2 p. M., carriages, buggies
i and all manner of vehicles drove up and
I were dispatched by their respective mana
gers all over the city. About half-past 1
it seemed as thoueb some one in authority
had said "scat," for the workers disap
peared in all directions, and a little later
Broadwa.? was deserted for the first time
in two weeks and the battle was transferred
from the sidewalks to the polls.
There was the usual talk of sacks on
both sides, but although all such reports
were strenuously denied the "profession"
experienced no difficulty in the matter of
treats. A peculiarity of the primary was
the respectable appearance of the "push,"
who usually are strangers to purple and
fine linen. To-day new suit 3 were in evi
dence to sucli an extent as to suggest tbe
suspicion that orders for new suits at a
fire sale had been liberally dispersed.
Each side charged the other with im
porting votes from across the bay, but
there was little foundation or justification
for such reports. The great register used
at the polls has only been completed two
days and was never in the hands of the
men who arrange the details for stuffers,
and the probability is tbat to-day's pri
mary is one of the purest held in many
years. '
MET AN ARMED ROBBER,
Exciting Experience of a Crowd
of Politicians at Midnight
in Oakland.
A Colored Man Threatens to Shoot
and Disappears in a
Stable.
Oakland Office San Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 15. I
A few minutes before midnight a crowd
of politicians on Eleventh street had an
exciting experience witli an armed bur
glar.
As a milkman was delivering milk to a
house on Clay street, near Eleventh, he
saw a man at a side window acting as
though making an attempt to hide him
self. The driver suspected that the man
was a robber and called bis boy off the
wagon. As soon as the lad came the man
rushed out of the yard and dodged around
the Congregational chnrch and ran for a
stable at the rear of the Blake Seminary.
A crowd of politicians were in his way,
and hearing the cry of his pursuers they
attempted to stop him. He turned around,
threw away a false beard and hastily un
locked the starjle door. He then faced his
pursuers, drew a gun and said, "Stop!
Now I'm at home and will shoot."
Sergeant Hodgkin and a couple of otÃ
cers surrounded the barn, but the robber
had escaped. His false beard was found
and the milkman declares positively that
the robber was a colored man. There is a
colored man employed in the stable, and
when he is found he will be required to
explain where he was at midnight.
A Petrified Snake.
A quite interesting addition, and one es
pecially attractive to naturalists, has been
made to the relic-room in the State House
by the presentation of a petrified snake
taken from a sea sponge.
It is the only one of its kind in the valu
able collection, and perhaps there is no
other in the State. It was given by Ora
Poe of Columbus, Ohio, to whom it came,
and who valued it very highly. The snake
is very small and rests in a curled posi
tion. It is attracting no little attention
among the visitors to the room.âCincin

COLORED RIDERS
GET NO ANSWER
Anxious to Join the League
of American Wheel
men.
WANT RECORDS KEPT.
Oakland Cycling Club Annoyed
at the Loni Offical
Silence.
DECLARE THEY AEE IGNORED.
Would Prefer to Know That They
Are Rejected Than to Remain
in Suspense.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, AuÂ«. 15. j
The Oakland Cycling Club has waited
several weeks for an answer from the
League of American Wheelmen, and it
has not yet been received. The Oakland
Cycling Club is a colored citizens' club,
and its members have been trying for two
years to obtain recognition from the
league, but so far have met with no suc
cess.
The question of admitting colored clubs
to the league is one of the most important
now before that bo ly. Although the
colored club 3in different States have
made application .for< admission and to
have their records officially recognized
their requests have neither been granted
nor denied.
Two years ago the Oakland Cycling
Club wrote to the chairman of this district,
R. M. Welch of San Francisco, stating tbe
desire of the club. He received an an
swer to the effect that the matter would
have to be decided by the official board.
A few months ago Captain Williams of
the Oakland Cycling Club wrote again and
repeated his question. He was again told
that the matter had not been decided.
Captain Williams wrote again and asued
Mr. Welch for any kind of an answer, but
it has not vet been received.
"We want to know where we stand,"
said Captai.i Williams to-day. "If the
league will tell us that they wiil refuse
membership to colored people, then we
shall know how to act, but ye object to
being stood off. We do not consider it
gentlemanly conduct on the part of the
league. We believe that we are entitled
to membership, and I am informed that
the ieague does not refuse to admit col
ored clubs, but so far they have not recog
nized them in any way.
"1 wrote a few weeks ago and saia that
if we were not to be admitted we wanted
to be told so, and we would not ask apain.
We are accustomed to being turned down,
but we object to being ignored.. There are
some very speedy colored riders, and we
think their records should De kept. At
present there is not a colored man's time
on record. Our club is strong and one of
our lady riders uolds a record for a mile,
but very few know it, because it is not
recognized. We think it is due to us that ,
the league decide this question at once
and inform us of their action. If they
have already decided they should let us
know. Scores of colored cycling clubs ad
over the country are awaiting' for some
action by the league."

Three Boys See a Man Trying to Get
Into a Houseâ A Couple Are Married
in the Early Morning.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 15.â Some one
tried to commit burglary at the Jackson
residence, 1125 Morton street, at 10:30 last
night, if the story of Frank Wheeler,
Tommy Garden and Bert Evans is true.
The two former lads were distributing
Hilborn literature through that part of
the town, and, according to their state
ments, they saw a man at the top of a lad
der set near the porch trying to gain an
entrance through one of the windows.
They ran back to Morton-street station
and acquainted Mrs. Evans, who keeps' a
stationery store, with what they bad seen.
She put little faith in the story, but her
son Bert went back with them and verified
the discovery. The man wore a long black
overcoat, and when he saw the three boys
he ran down the ladder and traveled down
San Antonio avenue as quickly as he
could. Word was then sent to police head
quarters, but no Â«ign of the individual
could be found. The Jackson family left
for Woodland on Thursday.

Facts Aboct Silver and Goldâ J. R. 8., St
Helena, Cal.. L. P. H., Arroyo Grande, San
Luis Obispo County, and a dozen others. Tbe
purpose of this department is to state facts,
and it will give such whenever obtainable,
but it will not undertake to express opinions
as to what will be tbe effect of a certain propo
sition, if gold is the standard, or if silver
should be adopted, or what would be tbe effect
on the country if ail the paper issued by the
Government was called in outside of National
notes.
Sixteen to one means in the United States
that silver dollars must contain sixteen times
as much pure metal as there is pure metal in
gold dollars. Parity is the maintaining of tbe
value of the two standard 'â 'd and
silver. A gold dollar col 25.3
grains; its fineness is 900. Th^e is 2.5
grains of alloy in a gold dollar. A unit of
gold or of silver is tbe standard fixed by tbe
Government. A silver dollar contains 371.2 ft
grains of pure silver and 41.25 grains of alloy.
Like the gold dollar its fineness is 900.
Limited coinage of silver is the restiiction
placed by thja Government on the amount of
bilver to tf<e coined by the mints. Unlimited
coinage of silver is allowing the mints to coin
all the silver bullion that may be brought to
them into standard dollars. Free coinage of
silver means that the mints shall coin into
standard dollars silver bullion, making no
charge for tbe same except the value ot tbÂ«
alloy. It is estimated that there isat this time
in the United States $026,000,000 in gold and
$625,000,000 in silver. The total per capita
for each individual in the United States,
according to calculation March 31, 1896, was
$21 53. A "gold bug" is a slang term applied
to a person who is said to be a millionaire and
also to a person who favors gold us tbe only
standard ior a country. A gold certificate or a
silver certificate is not a legal tender. It is
what is known in banking terms as a cer
tificate of deposit. It is evidence that there is
on deposit in the United Stales treasury (re
ferring in this answer, of course, to United
States certificates) as many dollars i n either
gold or silver Â»s the particular kind of
certificate shows on its face. These certificates
are not legal tender, but are exchangeable at
the treasury for the Kind of money they repre
sent. Government bonds are Government
promissory notes, redeemable within a certain
time.
The issue of gold coin in the United States ia
unlimited. Tbe denominations are $20, $10,
$5 and $2 50. As legal tender it is uu limited,
is receivable for all dues, and exchangeable
for certificates under limitations. The issue
of gold certificates is suspended so long as free
goid is under $100,000,000 in the treasury.
The denominations are $10,000, $5000, $1000,
$500, $100 and $50. These are receivable for
all public debts. The limit of issue of silver
dollars is the requirement to redeem treasury
notes. These are legal tender in any amount,
except when otherwise provided in the con
tract. They are receivable for all dues aud ex
changeable ior silver certificates or smaller
coins at tbe treasury. Silver certificates are
limited in the issue to the number of silver
dollars in use. The denominations are $1000,
$500. $160, $50, $20. $10, $2 and $1. These
are not a legal tender, but are receivable for
all public dues and are exchangeable ior dol
lars or smaller coins. United States notes are
receivable for ail dues, exchangeable for all
kinds ot money except gold certificates, and
are redeemable in coin at the sub-treasury in
New York aud San Francisco in sums of $60
or over.
Treasury notes of 1890 are the same as silver
certificates or silver dollars, receivable for ail
dues, exchangeable for United States notes
and redeemable in coin at the treasury. Cur
rency certificates are issued in the denomina
tion of $10,000, are not legal tender, are ex
changable for United Slates notes and redeem
able in lawful money at the treasury or bank
of issue. Tbe limit of issue of National bank
notes is the amount of United States bonds
and their cost. The denominations are $1000,
$500, $100, $50, $10 and $5. They are not
legal tender; they are receivable for all dues
except custom-house dirties and interest on the
public debt; they may be exchanged for silver
and minor coins and are redeemable at the
treasury or bank 6i issue. Subsidiary coins
are limited in issue according to the demands
of the country, are legal tender to the extent
of $10"only, may be exchanged for minor coins
and are redeemable in lawiul money at the
treasury in sums of $20 or any multiple.
Minor coins are legal tender only to the
extent of 25 cents. The denominations are 5
and 1 cent, and they are redeemable at tbe
treasury in the sum of $20 or over. At the
present time tbe United States has a gold stan
dard, using silver only as an accessory to
gold. , .. Â
Bimetallic money is money formed by open
ing gold and silver both to free coinage. The
following are the claims of the bimetalists:
" (1) Greater stability in the standard of
value. The two metals held together will re
gpond far less violently than would either
alone to any forces making for a change in
value. (2) A more convenient and adequate
supply of money. Gold alone is not enough to
furnish the basis of the world's exchanges.
(3) A par of exchange between gold countries
and silver countrias." The monoxnetaUists
urge: "(1) Tnat a fixed rate cannot be main
tained by law; that the two metals having dif
ferent sources of supply and demand will
fluctuate in value along different lines; that
their relative value is a result of natural and
not legal causes. (2) That, as a consequence,
a nation will practically have only one stand
ard at a time, and that standard the cheaper
metal, while the other metal will go to otner
countries. (3) That gold is preferred in
wealthier nations, and is less unstable
in value than silver and furnishes
an ample basis for the credit systems
of the chief commercial nations. (4) That tbe
two metuls, so far as they could be held to
gether, would feel the shock of any tendency
in either metal to change in value, and tne
value of the money standard would thus fluc
tuate more often."
At the close of 1895, so says the report of the
Controller of the Treasury, the amount of
god coin in the United Stales, including bul
lion In the treasury, was #1,260,987,506;
paper in circulation, $1,137,619,914; waking
a total of $2,398,607,420. On the Ist of June,
1895, the actuary estimated the population of
the United States at 69,954.000, and at that
time the returns to tne Controller of tb*
Treasury showed that tbe total banking
fundsâ "namely, capital, surplus, undivided
property and deposits of Xatio aland all other
banksâ was $6,703,544,084, making the nver
aee per capita $95 83. In 1894 these funds
â  amounted to $6,407,003,338, being $296,540,
--746 leas than in 1895.

THE RIGHT OF
FREE SPEECH,
Mass-Meeting of Socialists
, at Seventh and Mar-
ket Streets.
EIGHT ARE ARRESTED.
They Are Charged With Ob
structing the Street and Dis
turbing the Peace.
INDIGNITY OFFERED THE FLAG
Indignation Meeting Held at Socialist
Headquarters and Future Ac
tion Decided Upon.
The Socialists are determined to fight
for the liberty of free speech notwith
standing the decision of the jury in Judge
Low's court on Fridy convicting William
Edlin for obstructing the sidewalk. Edlin
appeared for sentence yesterday morning
and was fined $5 with the alternative of 24
hours in jail.
In view of Ediin's conviction a mass
meeting of Socialists was called for last
night at the corner of Seventh and Market
streets. They began to gather before 8
o'clock and by that hour there was a fair
sized crowd.
The trustees of the Odd Fellows' Hall
Association were holding a meeting and
when the speaking commenced on the
street they sent word to police headquar
ters that they could not Lear themselves
talking. They went outside and when
they saw the crowd they sent word to
police headquarters that the sidewalk was
beins obstructed. Captain Spillane was
notified by telephone and he sent Police
men Whalen, O'Connor and Jackson to
see tbat the law was not being violated.
William Costley had opened the meet
ing and spoke for about fifteen minutes,
Btandine upon a chair a few feet from the
edge of the sidewalk. He was followed by
E. T. KingÃl*y, a cripple, who is the nom
inee for Congress of the Socialist Labor
party in the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict. He had just commenced his ad
dress when ihe policemen arrived. They
were joined by Policemen ODea, the of
ficer on the beat, and the four pushed
their way through the crowd and Whalen
told Kingsley to move on and not obstruct
the stieet.
"Why?" asked Kingsley.
Without giving him an answer they
dragged him roughly from the chair and
placed him under arrest. Kingsley re
monstrated, and claimed that they were
using their privilege as American citizens
to peacefully assemble and discuss their
grievances. Costley also protested and
was placed under arrest.
As soon as Kingsley was dragged from
the chair George Speed mounted the ros
trum; but he had only uttered a few
words when he was also pulled down and
placed under arrest. George Aspden, M.
Speeney, J. Postler and E. Lux followed
in succession, and were treated in a sim
ilar manner. Then the seven were
marched down to Seventh and Mission
streets, where the patrol wagon was sum
moned from the Southern station.
When the wagon arrived they were
bundled into it, and the wagon was driven
to Seventh and Market. T. Anthony was
addressing the meeting at the time, and
he had an American flag in his hand. The
officers drauved him off the chair, and
one of them tore the flag out of his hands
and was in the act of throwing it on tne
street, when another officer grabbed it
from him and saved it from being dishon
ored. A howl of indignation went up at
the indignity shown the stars and stripes.
As the wagon started off for the South
ern station some one yelled, "Three cheers
for socialism !" and the crowd joined in
lustily. Then some one started in to sing
"Hail Columbia."
At the Southern station each of the
eight men arrested was booked on charges
of obstructing the street and disturbing
the peace. They promptly gave $20 bail

A meeting was afterward held at the
headquarters of the Socialist Labor party,
at which the action of the police in mak
ing the arrests was denounced. It was
also decided to communicate with the
labor unions, the Civic Federation, the
Woman's Suffrage Club and other oraam
zacions, asking them to attend a public
mass-meeting at an early date to discuss
the interf- rence with the liberty of free
speech accorded every American 1 citizen
by the constitution. These bodies will be
asked to co-operate with the Socialistic
Labor party on t is question.
It was also decided to hold another
mass-meeting this afternoon at Seventh
and Market streets.
"We will hold another meeting on the
corner of Seventh and Market streets at 2
o'clock to-morrow." said William Costley
last evening. "We are not transgressing
the laws and will tight tne case to the biiter
end."
BARRY FOR FREEDOM.
The Editor, With Others, Expresses
Strong Condemnation of Any In
fringement of Free Speech.
A fine of $5 was imposed by Police Judge
Low yesterday morning on William Edlin,
the young socialist who was found guilty
by a jury the day before yesterday of ob
structing the sidewalk by a speech at
Sixth and Folsom streets on the evening
of August 2, He paid the fine and will go
out and make more speeches.
Ediin's attorney. Arnold W. Liechti, is
the nominee of the Socialist Labor party
for District Attorney of the City and
County of San Francisco. He said yes
terday that he believes in socialism, but
that there are some things in the platform
of the party which he does not indorse.
He said: "I intended to take an appeal
from the verdict to the Superior Court and
if necessary to the Supreme Court to test
the principle, but I find the court sten
ographer had not taken the testimony and
consequently I could get no transcript.
Doubtless there will be more arrests of
Socialist Labor party speakers, and an ap
peal will then be taken to see whether free
speech still obtains in this country or
whether it does not."
When asked yesterday afternoon for his
opinion on the case of Edlin James H.
Barry said :
"I am not in sympathy with the views
of the Socialist Labor party, but I declare
it is outrageous to deny the right of a man
who is to speak and to arrest him. This
i man appears to have been interfering with
nobody and was exercising his right under
the constitution, till the policeman came
I along and took it away. Street lakers can
erect stands in the streets and obstruct the
sidewalks, but when a man mounts on a
chair and expresses his political views â
views that are probably not in accord with
the political affiliations of the authorities
â he is arrested and put in jail.
"The right of free speech and of a free
press should be maintained. If it is
throttled the Republic is in danger. We
want none of the autocracy of the Czar of
the Russias here. 1 think the arrest of
this man was a wrong â more than that.
1 repeat it was outrageous. Make that
strong. He was interfering with nobody's
rights. An injury was done to him, and
when an injury is done to one of the body
politic there is an injury to all.
"I am heartily in sympathy," concluded
Mr. Barry, ''with the resolutions offered
at the Trades Council meeting last night
by the delegates of the defense associa
tion and adopted by the Trades Council.
I am a member of that association, and as
a member I think some further aud pub
lic action should be taken in regard to
the arrest of this man. Suppose lam a
poor man, and that is not altogether a
supposition. I have no money to hire a
hall. I believe in educatine the people â I
believe in teaching them as Je>us Christ
did, from the highways and the byways,
and from the housetops."
I.J.Truman said: "I am certainly in
favor of free speech. ' The constitution
gives that right to every man. I think
public speeches ought to be made, and
could be made, so as not to interfere wiih
the rights of others. lam not opposed to
public meetings, out if you were a business
man you would not want meetings to be
held so as to cause a loss of $5 or $6. Let
public meetings be held, but let them be
conducted so as not to interfere with the
rights of others. I do not know whether
the speaker obstructed the sidewalk or
not."
C. B. Perkins said : "I am for free speech
at any time and all times. That is a right
that is guaranteed by the constitution of
the United States, and, I believe, by the
constitution of our own State, and every
man should be protected in this right,
whether he happens to be an orator of the

Award of the Scannell
Medal.
HE LOVED BRAVE DEEDS
The Deceased Chief Appreciated
the Good Work of His
Men.
ALL HOPED FOR THÂ£ TROPHY
An Engrossed Resolution Will Be a
Part of the Honor Conferred
on the Engineer.
The friends of John Wills, both in and
out of the Fire Department, were most
agreeably surprised yesterday when they
learned through The Call that the gallant
â â¢ j> J â â¢*â 
DISTRICT ENGINEER JOHN WILLS.
district engineer was to receive the coveted
decoration of the Scannell medal, the first
to be given out to a fireman under the
provisions of the old fire chief's will. The
deceased head of the department was a
lover of brave deeds. Despite his bluff
manner and short and occasionally pro
fane manner of delivering his commands,
particularly during the progress of a con
flagration, he was idolized by his men, each
of whom hoped to be the one to proudly
wear the emblem of heroism on his
breast.
Still all agree that Wills, by his gallant
rescue of helpless women from the
wrecked Fifth-street lodging-house, when
tottering walls and creaking timbers gave
warning of further danger, was entitled
fully to the medal, and there will be none
to grudge the honor when he first wears
the decoration.
The heads of the department, too, are
gl&d that the honor fell to .Wills, for his
service has been long and faithful and he
is considered one of the most efficient fire
men in the employ of the municipality.
Few aside from Chief Sullivan and the
The Medal of Honor.
trustees of the fund left by Chief Scannell
have seen the medal, but from one of these
a description of the decoration has been
obtained.
The scene when the trophy is pinned on
Wills' breast at the meeting of the Fire
Commissioners on Thursday evening nnetx t
will probably be an impressive one, for
such occurrences are uncommon in the
careers of those who risk tbeir lives to sa ve
those of others, and all will feel tfhe sol
emnity of the occasion when carrying out
one of the last wishes of their deceased
chief and honoring one of tnose wuom he
loved and respected.
An engrossed resolution will be pre
sented to Engineer Wills with the medal.-
A SCHOOL COUNCIL.
The First Meeting Culminated in an
Inglorious Fizzle.
Some time ago the City Board of Educa
tion conceived that it would be a good idea
to have a Council of Education to look
after the wants of the public schools and
to suggest whatever improvemjnts they
may deem necessary.
The suggestion was made by the Board
of Education, inspired by some unknown
persons, that the 900 and more teachers in
the public schools of this City should
select one representative for every ten
teachers ; that those representatives should
hold a meeting and select five of their
number to constitute the Council of
Education.
ThÂ« meeting was held in the auditorium
of the Girls' High School yesterday morn
ing, but only about twenty delegates ap
peared, the majority of whom were princi
pals of schools. Owing to the poor attend
ance no business was transacted, and tne
meeting adjourned.
It leaked out afterward that the proposi
tion is not favored by the teachers of this
City. The majority of them say that it
savors too much of politics, thai the com
mittee is likely to be one-sided, and that
what would be good for one school would
not be good for another. They say
also that it is the duty of the Board of
Education to look after the schools, and
not to delegate that duty to a council or a
committee.
Another attempt will be made in the
chambers of the Board of Education Â»t
3:45 P. M. next Thursday.
BUCKLEY SILVER CLUBS.
The Process of Organization Goes On
Through the City.
The Buckleyites orgauized many more
of their silver clubs throughout the City
last night and each club adopted resolu
tions making application for membership
in the proposed association of silver clubs
into which all these clubs are to be gath
ered in the "very near future.
The South Side Free-silver Club of the
Twenty-ninth District, the third club to
be organized in this district, elected the
following officers:

R. J. O'Keilly and Adolph Moeller; secretary,

POPULISTS ELECT KINNE
County Committee Fills a Vacancy and
Decides Upon Nightly Meetings
in a Big lent.
The County Committee of the People's
party met last night in Mozart Hall, 1358
Market street, and after resolving itself
into a county convention elected A. B.
Kinne to membership in the State Central
Committee to fill the vacancy caused by
the recent resignation of J. D. Thompson.
The assemblage also decided to hold a
public Populist meeting next Wednesday
night, corner of Ninth and Market streets,
in a large tent now on the premises. The
free use ot thf tent until the (irst of next
month was offered by Mr. Tingman, an
enthusiast, who says he wants to see a
rousing Populist meeting there every
night.
A committee consisting of W. E. Walker,
George D. Gillispie, B. G. Haskill, E. 8.
Barney, J. A. Anthony, W. J. Gre j r and
TJ. A. Lewis was appointed to canvass in
their respective districts for the purpose of
collecting a crowd for the initial meeting,
having electric lights put in the tent and
securing donations to the $20 or so neces
sary for the lighting. Twelve dollars of
the amount was at once subscribed last
night. The intention is to collect a dollar
or two each night Irom the audience and
thus pay for the rent of the tent, some $40
a month, from September 1 until election
day.
The election of a man to the vacancy in
the State Central Committee gave occa
sion for a prolonged wrangle, that finally
resulted in the nomination of A. B. Kinne
and U. A. L^wis. Kinne received nine
teen votes and Lewis eighteen, and
Haskell who had been leading a vigorous
indirect opposition to Kinne moved that
Kinne's nomination be made unanimous,
Lewis seconding the motion in a compli
mentary and conciliatory speech that did
much toward restoring harmony.
Then J. D. Thompson, the committee
man who had resigned, made complete ex
planation of his position and refuted the
insinuation that he had originally accepted
the place in order to get out and have
Kinne appointed. That restored peace
and tranquillity.anJ the convention turned
to the consideration ol a motion submitted
by Cator regarding district representa
tion. It was finally decided to lay the
matter over until next Saturday night.
" The county executive committee will
meet next Friday night, at 8 o'clock, in

Imported Grain Bags Are Sold
Cheaper Than the Prison's
Prices.
WARDEN HALES TWO REPORTS
The Cost of Keeping Prisoners Was
Only a Trifle Over 30 Cents
Each a Day.
The State Prison Directors met yester
day at San Quentin, Messrs. Hayes, De
Pue and Wilkens being present.
Governor Budd requested the board to
prevent a deficit in finance in the follow
ing letter:
Sacramento, Aug. 3.
To the Honorable Board of State Prison Di
rectors â Gentlemen": Some six months Bgoa
question was raised beiore the Board of Exam
iners whether or not a deficiency would arise
in the State Prison. We were assured by mem
bers of your board that no deficiency would be
incurred. My latest information is, however,
that one is now threatened, and I therefore
desire to request you In time to prevent tne
same as I doubt whether you will be able to
get an allowance for the same should it be
asked. Yours truly. James H. Bodd.
Director De Pue said that with the con
sent of the board he would answer the
Governor and explain the situation. tie
claimed there would be no deficiency if
the 2,000.000 jute bags on hand could be
sold, and as there was no doubt about the
sale he felt confident teat the financial
affairs of San Quentin Prison would be
satisfactory.
Regarding the condition of the jnte
department, Warden. Hale stated that
2,599,000 grain bags were on hand. Since
January 1, 1896, 3.020,535 bags had been
sold, 2.994,035 shipped, 26,500 sold and
awaiting shipment, 2,572,500 were on hand
available for immediate sale. The num
ber of sugar bags sold was 726,400, shipped
70,400, sold awaiting shipment 656.000, on
hand 225,500. to be manufactured 430,500.
There were 3566 bales of raw jute on hand,
a quantity sufficient to keep the mills
running till January 1, 1897.
The following testimonial, beautifully
engrossed; was signed and will be pre
sented to ex-Director Neff :
Whereas, The Hon. Jacob H. Neff, after
years of faithful service, has severed his con
nection with the State Board of Prison Direc
tors, and it is proper that this board should
place on record their appreciation of the
valuable services lendered by him,
Hesolved, By the State Board of Prison Di
rectors that lor the many years of gratuitous
services given by the Hon. Jacob H. Nefl to
the State prisons of California, for the careful
and painstaking attention he has given to ail
the different matters that came before him in
that capacity, for the kindness he has at all
times manifested lor the unfortunate persons
in prison over whom he had jurisdiction,
and for his kindly and courteous treatment
of all with whom he came in contact he
is deserving of and possesses the gratitude
of the people of the State of California.
In his intercourse with his colleagues on
the board, his gentlemanly conduct, his
high sense of honor, his unswerving integrity
of purpose, his wide knowledge of men and
affairs and his large fund of common-sense
made him an invaluable member, whose
counsels and assistance will be missed in all
the positions of honor and trust that he has
filled. He has ever attempted to perform his
duties faithfully, and in the difficult position
of a Stale Prison Director, which growing
cares have compelled him to resign, he is en
titled to the highest reward that can be paid
to a faithful officer. "Well done, good and
faithful servant." We wish him In all the
years that lie before him prosperity and happi
ness, acd snail ever view with pleasure our
association with him as a colleague.
Resolved, That this resolution be spread upon
the minutes of the board at San Quentin and
Folsom.
Warden Hale presented his reports for
the forty-sixth and forty-seventh fiscal
years. These reports included the yearly
statements from the captain of the yard,
the turnkey, the physician, the chaplain
and the prison clerk. According to the
Warden's showing, the net cost for each
man was $9 26 a month, or 30.45 cents a
day. The monthly average of prisoner*
for" the forty-sixth year was considerably
less than for the former year, it being
1287 Vi against 1351.
Director Wiltins interrupted the War
den with a remark regarding the commit
tal of prisoners from San Francisco. "Is
it not a fact," he asked, "that there are
scarcely any prisoners sent to San Quentin
from San Francisco? Nearly all convicts
from there are sent to Folsom. Is there
not some way by which we could bring
this to the attention of the Superior
Judges of San Francisco, so that more
prisoners might he committed to San
Quentin, where they are needed more
than at Folsom?"
One of the directors remarked that
Judge Wallace specified no particular
prison in committing convicts.
"The Sheriff gets two days' w ork out
of It when he takea a prisoner to Fol
som," the Warden remarKed. "And that
explains the predilection to Folsom."
Reading of the report was resumed. The
physician's statement showed an increase
in the number of deaths, which was ac
counted for by the prevalence of pulmon
ary troubles, three executions, one death
from a knife wound and one suicide. In
this connection a proper place for the care
and treatment of the partially insane con
victs was recommended.
The report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1896, contained some interesting
facts regarding the prison. During this
year 2,710,252 pounds of raw jute were
manufactured, and there was a loss of
181.337 pounds in manufacturing, or
6 691-1000 per cent. The net cost of oper
ating was $136,262 98; net sale%, $105,106 21)
total loss on goods sold, $12,288 45. Com
menting on this loss the Warden stated:
In the first place the Wilson tariff bill, which
went into effect two years ago, placed grain
bags made in foreign countries on the free list,
and while this had the effect of reducing' tne
price of such bags imported in 1895 it does not
appear to have had the same eflect upon the
price at which the raw material could then be
obtained.
The selling price of the prison bags in 1894
was i})i cents, and at that figur. a small profit
was made even at the high price we had to
pay for the raw material. For the season of
1895, however, bags were imported from Cal
cutta at a greatly reduced figure, and while
your honorable board endeavored to keep up
the price so as to save this institution from
loss, fixing at first at 5 cents, then reducing it
to 4% and at last to 4.20 cents, the bag-dealers
and brokers of San Francisco arranged to
undersell us all alone and the consequence
was that the farmers did not place their orders
with us; our sales did not equal our manu
facture.
Other causes for the low price were the
short grain crop and the Ostrom act, fix
ing conditions of sale of bags. This law,
the Warden said, places ' the board always
at a disadvantage.
The turnkey's report gave the average
monthly number of prisoners for the year
as 1279%, as against 1216^ the previous
year.
The resident physician recommended
enlarged and improved bathing facilities
for prisoners, and also a suitable ward for
the partially insane prisoners.
Notwithstanding the extra expense of
constructing a road in Marin County,
which had to be paid out of the general
appropriation fund, the gross cost 0? main

FRUIT FOR CHARITY.
How a Big Glut of Produce Was Dis
posed Of by a Firm of Com
mission Men.
The tremendous glut of fruit that exists
on the water front at the present time
may be very hard on the shippers of the
produce when it becomes necessary to give
away or destroy tons, but it is like the
proverbial ill wind, for it has made glad
the hearts of the inmates ot the various
charitable institutions of the City.
Yesterday the crush was so great on
some of the wharves that the boxes could
scarcely be moved and more steamers
were expected at any time. It became
necessary to clear away a portion of the
fruit, and about 1000 b,oxes, half pears and
half peaches, as well as some tomatoes,
were about to be dumped overboard by
McDonough & Runyon, the commission
merchants. Just at that time Market In
spector Ben Davis happened along, mak
ing his rounds, p.nd the fate of the fruit
was speedily changed.
After a talk with the inspector the
charitable institutions mentioned were
notified that if they would send wagons
they could have all the pears and peaches
they wantnd free, and in consequence
many an orphan and invalid were the
guests of the commission men last even
ing. The overplus will be disposed of in
this manner hereafter. -

The glory of the Golden Gate speaks forever for itself. Yet how few now living
in these headlong days know the story of Us discovery and name. Nine men in ten
will tell you, even here as they look out upon the great ocean through the gate that it
was named by the Argonauts and that the name was born of the golden fleece. But
the simple truth is John C. Fremont gave it that name years before gold was found.
Mrs. Fremont, writing from Los Angeles, May, '96, in connection with this fact,
and the spot from which General Fremont took his observations and gave tbe gate its
name, says, quoting first from Fremont's reports to Congress and then adding a para
graph of her own:
The bay of San Francisco is separated from the sea by low mountains. Looking from the
peaks of the Sierra Nevada the coast mountains present an apparently continuous line, with
only a single gap, resembling a mountain pass. This is the entrance to the great bay and is
the only water communication from the coast to the interior country. Approaching from the
Ma tbe coast presents a bold outline. On the south the bordering mountains come down in a
narrow ridge of broken hills, terminating in a precipitous point, against which the sea breaks
heavily. On the northern side the mountain presents a boid promontory, rising in a few
miles to a height of two or three thousand feet. Between these points is the strait â about one
mile broad in the narrowest part and five miles long from the sea to the bay.
Passing through tnis gate (called Chry>ODolae on the map on the same principle that the
harbor of Byzantium (Constantinople afterward) was called Chryoceras (Golden Horn). The
form of the harbor and its advantages for commerce, and that before it became an entrepot
of Eastern commerce, suggested the name to the Greek founders of Byzantium. The form of

about 2000 feet above the water, crowned by a forest of the lofty cypress, which is visible from

peak of Mount Diablo, nearly 4000 feet hign (3770), overlooks the surrounding country of the
bay and San Joaquin.

J. B. Fremont.
The Fremont road, that bends above Oakland from Berkeley to Mills Seminary,
after being closed for half a century, is once more open.
You want to see San Francisco? Well, you must go over to Oakland to see San
Francisco. And do you want to see Oakland and San Francisco and the bay of all
bays on the globe and the Golden Gate at a glance and all together? Then you must
go two mileÃ to the northeast and one mile perpendicular. In short, you must climb
to the once famous Fremont road and to the camp where Fremont tented half a
century ago and from which spot he named the now famous Golden Gate years before
gold was found.
And now please let me tell you how to get there. Mrs. Fremont, as before noted,
confirms and locates beyond doubt the spot from which California's first Senator
looked upon this marvel of nature in all its gorgeous magnificence and gave this opu
lent and color-crowned name to our doorway.
It is a bit remarkable that the bay of San Francisco was discovered by land. It is
none the less noticeable that the Golden Gate was named, not by any navigator or
voyager by sea, but from the solid land, by a man who bore the dust of 3000 miles of
wilderness and desert on his leathern garments.
The first question asked by the novice in roadcraft and camp life is, "Why did
Fremont and Kit Carson keep along these rug?ed Contra Costa steeps instead of the
level valley ?'' Water. The one and only answer is, water. In all the broad levels
from San Pablo Bay to the pleasant brooks of old San Jose Mission, there was not a
drop of fresh water at certain seasons of the year. True, there were vast herds of
cattle here when Fremont came, but these cattle had to take to the foothills for water
in tbe aiid months of August and September. General Beale, afterward our Minister
to Austria, but "Midshipman Beale" at the time, as Fremont calls him in his early
reports of his explorations, speaks of killing "Spanish elk 1 ' for supplies from his boat
on San Pablo Bay, Dut these cattle watered from the hills. Of course, boats plied, at
long periods, up and down the Sacramento from New Helvetia (Sacramento) to Yerba
Buena (San Francisco), but no travel passed up and down the river bank; that way
was not only impassable by water, but perilous from savages and lawless Mexicans.
One of the most pathetic chapters in our naval history is the loss of a ship's boat and
its entire crew in passing between these two points. Fremont had, as an army officer,
procured from a man-of-war a large sum of money with which to pay his men at
Sutter's Fort. The naval commander dispatched his> boat with the money in charge
of two of his officers and a picked crew to Fremont by way of the Sacramento River.
Neither boat, men nor money was ever heard of any more.
The names of the officers and marines were carried forward on the payroll for ten
years, but no tidings of any sort ever came, and at the end of that time they were
given up as lost Probably a sudden squall and the boatload of silver and the brave
men are still togetner in the bottom of San Pablo or the Carquinez Straits; for it is
not recorded in all our naval or military history that any officer ever betrayed such a
trust. But such dalliance as this with every dramatic story of olden days and there
will be no end. We must get on to the Fremont road.
The Old Road as It Appeared In 1854.
I first passed over this road in tbe fall of 1854, as bellboy and cook along with
Mountain Jo, one of Fremont's former men, who was driving a band of half-wild
horses from Southern to Northern California. The road was not in his line of travel,
but there were two things almost indispensable to Mountain Jo and his horses,
whisky and water. My duties were to ride an old bell mule in the lead of his band
of wild horses and wilder Mexicans and look out for "wood, water and grass," and
there pitch camp. Jo could find the whisky without any help from nis "roustabout
boy."
My recollection of the road, after breaking camp at the "Embarcadero," near
what is now the new pier of F. M. Smith's narrow-gauge Walnut Creek railroad, is
mainly of the beautiful wooded and watered Jack Hays Canyon. I think it was
then called Temescal. Now and then there were peeps through the pines and red
woods as the dusty trail rose and fell up and down the billowy but ever ascending
foothills. The trail was knee-deep in dust; and wild oats, rusty, dusty and golden green,
rose on either side to my shoulders as I climbed and climbed. Great long ox teams
now and then covered the trail, plodding sleepily down toward what is now Oakland,
and then we came to a little steam sawmill, and a young man by the name of Moody
had charge of the camp. He is now president of the First National Bank in Oakland.
We spent the night here, the Mexicans and the cook. Jo did not come up till morn
ing. Here we struck a great wagon road. It was belly-deep with dust in some
places. As we went up the precipitous hill before coming to what is now the Red
wood road, we met Immigrants with trees tied to their wagons to keep them from
pushing too hard on their poor starved and staggering oxen. This made the dust
nearly intolerable and wore the roads into deep ruts that may be seen to the left of
tbe new road to this day a dozen feet deep. But enough and more than enough of
the old days.
To get on with the road go to Berkeley first and then go steeply up to the south
of the university for ten minutes through the town, a roar of hammers on either
hand (for this place is building with marvelous rapidity), ana there you strike the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
university end of the new Fremont road, only now made passable all the way, but far
from complete. The other end is in the region of Mills Saminary. The entire trip up
and around the new moon that bends about the Contra Costa hills is twenty miles
that is from one extreme side of Oakland around and back to the other extreme side.
Strangely enough there is no dust as of old. The adobe is packed down and, as a
rule, is hard as steel. Wheelmen make the entire circuit. True, the road is a bit,
billowy as yet, but no fault is found with it.
You must not look badi for the first half mile. You might see what you please to
call the University of California. It is a monstrosity in burnt mud. Monstrosity on
top of monstrosity and a dozen together; the only question is which is the ugliest.
Stanford's is built right down on the grass, with no outlook at all, and yet Stanford's
is comparatively a bird's nest in an oak, while this is a squinel's hole in a hillside.
And yet magnificent young men house here; the bigjrest and the best hearts â the
heart and the hope of tbe State.
Gazing Down on Cities From Above the Clouds.
And now look below! Bowling along over the high billowy Contra Costa foot
hills you are above the clouds, the cities! Tbe clouds under you to your right are
like cotton. There are people who have no sense of color, or contour, or anything
else but cents, who will always speak of these mobile and snowy garmentings of
mother earth as "fog." Heavens! What fogs envelop so many of us and make as
blind, blind, blind! "And God looked upon ail that he had made and behold it was
very good."
What would tbe world do without clouds? Andatnotwohoursoftheday.no
two minutes, indeed, are the views along here alike. You see the higher streets of
San Francisco above the rolling surging sea mist. The great cross of the Lone Moun
taid Cemetery lifting in grand and solemn loneliness above all things and looking
strangely tall and vast.
On and on, uo and down and yet surely upward you wheel across the billowy
lower foothills and then you dip down into the historic ever green and watered Jack
Hays canyon. A rich man, founder of the rival Oakland waterworks, houses Here.
GENERAL JOHN C. FREMONT, the Man Who Gave the Golden Gate Its
Name Years Before Gold Was Found.
Toe valley is set with palms, flower-houses and all that goes to make tip civilization in
a California country seat.
On and on! Schoolhouses, churches, long lanes of stately trees. Yet all these
any California seaport may have, Dut not the scene below. The clouds have rolled
above Oakland, lifted, rifted a little, and church spires are pointing up and through
the sea of snow that undulates, lifts, pulses at your feet. The whole bay is a mobile
floor of silver. Not a suggestion of the sea! Tamalpais, with its winding track and
trains above the clouds that conceal San Pablo Bay, a white lighthouse on the head
lands below, Black Point, Sutro Heights, Fort Alcatraz, thqftips and topmasts of sail,
that is all â
Where phantom ships unchal lenged pass
The gloomy guns of Alcatraz.
Twelve o'clock and not a cloudâ not a cloud above or about the peaceful fair
visage of beautiful Oakland below you. And yet do not miss the clouds, God's gar
ments' hem. Truly, all that is good or great is veiled, garmented in mist, clouds, mys
tery. The priest has his sacred place, the house of God has its holy of holies. All
things in nature have their mantled mysteries. The little seeds take life in the dark
mold; all life begins in secret, silence, majestic mystery, the large solemnity of night.
So that if the clouds should close the door below and lock the Golden Gate, even
mantle and quite envelop you as you ascend the Fremont Road, as may happen, do
not find fault with nature, as so many new people do â New York, Boston people, who
can only see "fog" in it all or out of it all.
The Spot Where Bierstadt Painted His Famous Picture.
After five miles you come in s ght of the spot where Uierstadt painted his famous
picture of the Golden Gate for Fremont. This was in 1863. Of course, this work was
the sensation, in an art way, of the day, and there are still many men and women tn
San Francisco who crossed the bay and climbed the hills to see the spot from which
the Gate was named and to see tha artist at work.
A mountaineer by nature and trade, I was of those who took a deep interest in the
matter. A party of us, toting our blankets on our backs, pitched camp near the site
of the little sawmill before mentioned. We camped about a week here, living mainly
by hunting. One day (this was after Bierstadt and bis friends had all gone away,
bl JUAUtUN riILLCK.
leaving the place, now a barren sheep ranch quite empty of human life) we found on
retiring to camp that our entire stock of bread and bacon had been eaten by wild
beasts. A hunting party was organized out of the shee^heniers and a few ranchers,
and the result was: Two black bears, a California lion and lots of smaller game.
The spot where the picture was made is a conspicuous little red hill, now set with
a little diadem of pines from the black forest of Germany and Italian cypress trees
from the grave of Shelley, in Rome. It is near the foot of the Arbor day cross planted
by Mayor Suiro, Genera! Howard, Senator Perkins and others, and is only a few rods
from the road to the left as you go from the university to Mills Seminary. Mrs.
Fremont says of this picture and the story of it in a letter to the writer dated Los
Angeles, May, 1896:
"When Bierstadt went to California to study its scenery (and the Rocky Mountains
en route) we gave him letters to Starr King and other friends. It was about April of
1863. In giving him a commission to paint for us the Golden Gate, with the setting
sun lighting the pathway into it, both of us, Mr. Fremont and myself, gave him fully
oar feeling. I clearly remember Mr. Fremont saying ne must see the sunset from the
Contra Costa, as he had to realize the force and splendid appropriateness of the name
in its scenic sense, apart' from the other idea of the gateway of commerce. Bierstadt
made a grand picture. When we had to sell what would bring needed money
Commodore Garrison bought this for $4000, just what we had given bierstadt.
"My daughter, wno was from her seventh year a constant companion of her
father on long horseback rides and days of working explorations on the Mariposas,
as well as many a long ride around San Francisco â as often in quieter times on the
Hudsonâ remembers many and many a talk on views, on physical geography, on
beautiful camps, for she has her father's silent delight in nature and is his true child
in loving to read of, study and inform herself of geographical travel. She says she
feels sure you are right."
Here in a saddle of the mountains are many springs, and, being the last fresh
waters on the road to the bay below the old camp of Fremont, was a favorite camping
pot. This was the famous dueline ground where many deadly encounters were had,
the most noted of which was the one when Colonel Woodleaf fell at the hand of young
Kewen, brother of the late Congressman Kewen of Los Angeles. Kewen fell with
Walker at Rivas, Nicaragua, dying with the same rifle in hand with which he had
killed Woodleaf.
Where Fremont Stood When He Named the Golden Gate.
The exact spot where Fremont took observations and named the Golden Gate, ao
cording to his own account, is nearly half a mile further on, at a great rock with a foun
tain bursting from its base. There can be no mistaking the place. The rock is down on
sthe maps and charts as Castle Rock. For be it remarked that all this sightly region, once
wooded and watered, was first denuded by the sawmills and then fire after fire swept
the country; then sheep held possession for about forty years while the roads were
obstructed and travel went by other ways, and all these years the place was abandoned
and forgotten. The disposition of the Ã¼biquitous and multitudinous small boy to
detach and roll rocks had made Fremont's rock an unsightly heap and the fountain
had become obstructed by broken stones, but it has at la3t been somewhat restored
and the loose fragments turned into a wall. The new road passes only a few hundred
feet below the great rock. Mrs. Fremont says:
"The great rock stamps it. He loved a mass of detached rock. * * * When I
was written to by a New Yorfc friend of an intended monument to the general I asKed
that they would spare him the commonplaces that make such sadly mourning-stones
usurp our finer ideas. If they must, then put up a great rock, a rough mass of granite,
such as he had carved the emblem of the cross upon 'according to the custom of
early travelers' â for he felt the strontr, invisible power that grasped the heavens and
the carth â and on it put only bis name."
But the very finest view of the Golden Gate, San Francisco, "The Sleeping
Beauty or Tamalpais. Oakland, Alameda, and, in truth, the whole under world of
land and water, is from a point still a little further on and across the small bridge
here, at a small grove of cypress trees set to mark the favored spot.
At morning, noon or night, especially night, when the heavens and the earth are
on fire â for you cannot tell where the lights leave off and the stars begin â the scene is
the most gorgeously magnificent on all the globe.
Deep below as lies the valley,
Steep below as lies the town,
Wh ere great seaships ride and rally
And the world walks up and down.
On the sea of lights far streaming.
When the thousand flags are furled
And the gleaming bay ll*s dreamiug
As It duplicates the world!
The finest days here are the stormy or winter days, when there are no forest flrei
to make a haze and the clouds are at work below in all their mobile and ever-changing
glory. Early spring is quite as effective. At that time the clouds are being driven
out from the Oregon Edens by the naming swords of approaching summer, and they
surge down tbe coast an if terrified and pour in at the Golden Gate like flying fugi
tives, the California sun spilling all its golden opulence on this surging, inflowine sea;
a ship's masts piercing through, a church spire, the green hills of San Francisco
beyond â but how idle are all words here!
It is noticeable that at eacn equinox the sun, from this â Fremont's â point of
â¼iew, falls down exactly into the Golden Gate, and it is always at such times in
credibly vast, blocking for a few moments the whole gate with its disk of gold.
I once saw a black cloudâ black as midnight and as boundlessâ hang above this
ball of gold as it rolled down into the golden chasm of the Golden Gate. But the sun
did not heed the cloud. The cloud was only blacKer from the brightness of the golden
globe, and the gate and the walls of the gate, and the bay, and the City, and all the
cities up and down, and the islands, and the ships, and, indeed, all the world, the
beavens and the earth, all things, save tnat awful nightmare of black cloud above the
golden sun, were for a moment nothing but molten gold. Then the sun sank,
sank suddenly into the sea, as if it had, indeed, been a mighty ball of gold, and the
blackness fell down as suddenly in his place, and blackness was only blackness, as if
God himself had closed the gate with a bang, and forever.
The Poet Completes the Journey Over the Crescent Way.
Five miles more of this. Passing to the left, the great track in the old road where
immigrants used to let their wagons down by trees, and you climb up and then down
to the Redwood road and begin to descend, with Mills Seminary before you. Five
miles of levels after this and you enter Alameda, Oakland.
This is only an outline, a sort of blazing out of a trail. lam too wise at my trade
to attempt the impossible.
Chauncey Depew â and who could be better authority? â last spring pronounced
the seventeen-mile drive at Monterey the grandest on the globe. But he had not seen
this Fremont road. It was not then completed.
It is conceded that the Monterey drive is crand, restful, inspiring, and a glory and
an honor to the State; but as compared to this new moon that bends above and about
Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda, it is but a nursemaid's path for babies' little wagons.

FAMOUS PAINTINGS IN THENATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY OF ENGLAND
The National Portrait Gallery is an ex
tension of the National Gallery itself. It
was opened a year ago. The building,
presented to tne Government, now holds
one of the most remarkable collections in
existence. Many of them have been taken
from the old permanent exhibitions in the
South Kensington and Bethnal Green
museums, many have been loaned or pre
sented from private collections. Here we
have the heroes of war, of literature, of
science, of painting and of the stageâ hung
amicably in effigy according to the period
of their activity. There the noble Duke of
Monmoutn stares into the face of his con
queror, William of Orange; there Warren
Hastings and Burke and Sheridan coufab
uiate; queens and actresses, and kingÃ and
commoners are reduced to colored illus
trations from the vivid history of the past
three centuries.
Upon entering the gallery we come in
to the great hall sacred to the Chief Jus
tices and Lord High Chancellors, enor
mous portraits, imposing in size and in
gorgeous colors. Here are scarlet robes of
office, and gold chains,and ermine mantles,
and ponderous locks, and the beads under
the great curled wigs have a monumental
seriousness and dignity as becoming these
pillars of the state. There is only one por
trait really interesting from a painters'
point of view and that is one of John,
Lord Campbell, Lord Chief Justice, Lord
Chancellor, and author of the "Lives" of
many of his distinguished brothers in
office. The artist is Thomas Woolnoth.
The color of the head is singularly fresh;
the paint has the broken vivid effect of a
sketch, in which the eyes, small and liquid,
twinkle with a pale-blue merriment; the
hair is his own and is shaggy and disor
dered; the hand in his coat, the sword he
carries, even the frills at neck and sleeves,
contribute to the animation ot the portrait.
Everywhere the light falls and glitters
slightly in little sharp ] oints or subdued
reflections.
Lord Lvndburst, son of John Singleton
Copley of Boston, has a grim and lofty
countenance, superior to the ills and mis
eries, the faults and failings of poor earth
born mortals.
The first Lord Dennian, one of the Coun
cil of Queen Caroline, looks more like a
Roman pontiff than a British statesman.
His robe is as red as that of a cardinal.
Around his neck is a small piece of trans
parent lawn, cut in small oblong strips,
and in the background is a suggestion of
columns and a rich blue sky, like the col
onnade of St. Peter's and a bit of an Ital
ian summer.
In the rotunda at the head of the stairs
we rind Queen Caroline seated in a large
chair, with a surprised and expectant ex
pression. She looks like a fishwife mas
querading in royal robes and as though
discovery of the deception was imminent.
A red plush bat with a disheveled feather
is clapped down low over her forehead, her
red plush gown is creased in great folds
over her crossed knees, her hands and
arms are brawny and red.
Opposite hanus the well-known profile
of her royal lord, King George IV. That
fresh and vigorous study was made for the
head on the coinage by Sir Thomas Law
rence.
A careful portrait of Queen Victoria by
Angeii, copied from the original in Wind
sor Cattle, occupies the place of honor.
la the next room there is an absurd
little portrait of Admiral Nelson, who
conies mincing forward, "on the light,
fantastic toe," balancing like a dancing
master, in very tight knee breeches, and a
long, gold-braided scsrlet coat and his
cocked hat pulled rakisnly awry.
One of the most interesting collections
is that presented by Frederick Watts, em
bracing many of the celebrities of the last,
naif century. An entire room is given
over to them and a lew hardly les3 inter
esting portraits.
Here is Walter Scott, by Landseer, and
poor young Keats, with his melancholy
profile, bending over a book, painted after
his death by his friend, Joseph Severn. Here
also is Lord Byron in his youth, and in the
guise of the "Corsair," with a theatrical
and sentimental expression. In the cor
ner, in a dark room, a miserable portrait,
WHERE SWEET FLOWERS MOST TRULY REFLECT GOD'S GRAGIOUS SMILE
iJp on Butter street, drawn modestly
back a step or two from the pavement,
is a small house with the simple sign,
"Fruit and Flower Mission."
All day and neariy all night feet, light
and heavy, glad and sorry, pass this un
assuming place, and eyes, seeing or un
seeins.', meet the sign.
Every Thursday bright-faced girls come
out from the house Jaden with heavy
baskets, and in twos and threes they go in
all directions. For many years there has
been a fruit and flower mission and every
â week the girls have gone out with baskets
on their arms and sweet charity in their
hearts. Yet of the great hosts of com
fortable people in the City a very few un
derstand the importance and the breadth
of the flower-mission work. The poor and
the sick know.
It may be that you, whose eyes rest on
. these words now, have passed the little
cottage as I used to, with tha idea that it
was a fad of wealthy young ladies who
needed no assistance, and wished to keep
the affair exclusive. I had a vague picture
in my mind of butterflies fluttering down
to the mission with a small bunch of flow
ers, and much purple and fine linen, eat
ing lunch and exchanging society gossip,
and sending a basset of flowers by a mes
senger-boy to a hospital.
With the authority of a great newspaper
behind me to balance my lack of social
prestige, I visited the Fruit and Flower
Mission on distributing day.
First, I tripped going down an abrupt
step and gracefully presented myself in the
basement Lead first. Two women in big
aprons and sleeve protectors, who were
sorting flowers at a big table, smiled like
old friends, and were "so glad I came.''
If I would go upstair?, they said, the sec
retary would tell me all about the work.
In the front rooms, upstairs, there were
perhaps a dozen yonng ladies, all in shirt
waists and round hats and all Dusy. Such
a cabbie. Such a pleasant, busy gabble,
too. Such an intentness in filling "my
basket" with just tue right articles. Where
was the purple and fine linen and where
the elegant ease?
The secretary and two older ladies were
flying about iike mothers at Christmas
time, dealing out supplies and listening to
the appeals of the poor who had applied in
person for relief.
The name of the charity is a pretty one,
but I think it misleading. The fruit and
flowers are there, but only as the dessert
after the more substantial relief. Great
bins of flour and oatmeal can hardly be
called fruit or flowers, nor can canisters
of tea and coffee, barrels of sugar, sacks of
potatoes, bottles of beef extract and port
wine, shelves full of clothing and rows of
shoes. Ail these and more are in the

but full of a quaint interest, we find
Charles and Mary Lamb, two funny, bent,
little old people; Mary with a cap and
bobbing curls, and both dwarfed as pig
mies and with apple-red faces.
The beautiful tread of Leigh Hunt and
the badly painted portrait of Thackeray
are the only ones that take the attention
away from the noble collection painted
and presented by Frederick Watts. Tne
first is of Dante s Gabriel Rossetti, with
PHILIP KEMBLE, BY GILBERT STUART.
storerooms of the mission, and the baskets
the girls carry are heavy with the neces
saries of life, and invalid dainties. The
handful of flowers on the top is only a
touch of beauty to crown the whole.
The aim of the Flower Mission is not to
make steady pensioners, but to have a
constantly changing field. The motto
should be, "To help over hard places."
The purpose is to help those who are ill,
while they are ill; to take strengthening
food, cheerful books, warm clothes and
bright flowers into the sickrooms qi the
poor. Could you imagine a sweeter
charity?
After showing me all the stores and ex
plaining that they were bought with mis
sion money instead of being, as I thought,
contributed by merchants, the secretary
told me something queer.
The Flower Mission nee^s more flow
ers. Think of that. In this land of flow
ers, where, if you plant a pine knot, roses
will grow from one end and peaches from
the otuer, it is difficult to gather in half a
dozen basketf uls once a week without pay
ing for them.
"People forget the Flower Mission, 1 ' the
secretary said a little sadly as she turned
away lrom the table.
I think it is not all from forgetfulness or
carelessness, but from ignorance. People
do not Know how gladly the mission will
welcome the blossoms. I felt guilty, re
membering how I had snipped off my
sweet peas and dropped them on the
ground to keep them lrom going to seed.
Would I like to go visiting with two of
the girls to see how they worked ? Yes,
indeed, and 1 wanted to carry a basket. So
my basket was loaded, and with two girls
1 started on my first mission of charity in
San Francisco. One of the girls was a
young matron, but that doesn't matter- If
you come from the mission you are a girl.
My basket was heavy. It was large, too,
and i was awkward in the managing of it,
and had to be helped on the dummy.
"Nevermind," said the young matron,
"it is awkward till you get used to it, and
the handle makes your arm. black and
blue, but that is nothing."
We transferred to the little horsecar and
went out Fifth street to some side place,
where we were to leave the first basket.
On the way I learned that no promiscuous
work is done, but that all cases are inves
tigated by the Associated Charities. "Of
course," the young matron added in her
decided wayâ such a kindly way, tooâ
"some of them are not worthy, but they
are sick and miserable and that is all we
think of."
I was going straight past a big uely
house which might long ago have been
a mansion, but the girls called me back,
ran up the broad steps, opened the door

up to a room in the rear.
The door opened and a broad German
"Ach, ja, the dear girls," welcomed us.
In this small room lives, cooks, eats and
sleeps an old woman who will die one day
from the cancer eating her breast. Some

I thought the very
poor would be very
dirty. They often aie
and I have thought
that in tbeir place I
might be just so. But
this little den was the
essence of neatness.
The stove, tiny and
old, shone and twin
kled, and the floor
was fit to use for a
table. The first thing
the invalid noticed
after answering the
inquiries of the girl 3
was the flowers. They
were oid- fashioned
flowers unknown to
me except by the
children's name,
"pincushions." In
broken, toothless
English she told us
how they crew in her
garden lone ago when
she was young and
not poor.
Out of the basket â 
came a package ofl
coffee and one of su-H
gar, a little bag ofl
flour, a layer of pota-M
toes and a giass ofl
jelly.
Not one mite of avel

both sides. Did sheH
want any thing in p3r-M

Yes, she would needH
more rags for ban-B

the young maid said,
"I'll hant some for you, and some moTe

The next place was near. We went
through one house into another in the

the air is enough to make a well person

fairs of the family.
Tort vine and beef extract were part ol
head like a lion, great locks of iron-gra y
bair falling over a Jove-like front. The
head of the father in the Laocoon group
flashes into the memory, and this head
has a touch of the same immortal pain.
Then we have Cardinal Manning, thin and
fine and grave, with a network of lines
around his eye?, a face worn to a shadow
by a long life of thought and labor; the
hands, that are tbin and fine and veined
and sunken, are no less characteristic.
At the entrance is a portrait of Cardinal
Newman, painied by Miss Deane. There
is a slight indecision about the drawing.
It is a matter of doubt whether the Car
dinal is standing or sitting down, but the
gentie severity of the oid head is very
well done.
John Stuart Mill has almost the samÂ»
characteristics as Cardinal Manning, the
same emaciated, worn face, the sunken
eyes, the thin, bent nose, and the line of
the mouth fine and ascetic and reserved.
The portrait of Carlyle by Watts hangs
below one of the same subject by Sir John
Millais.
The Watts portrait is like a Socrates,
the Millais is like a Diogenes â both are
indubitably philosophers, but about the
portrait by Watts is an indefinable
loftiness, as there is about the thick
lipped, stub-nosed, big-browed physiog
nomy of his Athenian intellectual an
cestor. Millais represents him with
white, rough hair around a lean, deeply
colored countenance, with protruding lips
and jaw and strange, fierce blue eyes
under straight overhanging brows; his
long, cadaverous, claw-like hands grasp
ike two arms of a chair. The painter has
apparently seized a moment when he
has just given vent to an amiable senti
ment and regrets it.
Next to him we find Lord Lytton, the
romantic aulhor of "Lucile" and one time
Minister to France. He is the ideal of a
schoolgirl; perhaps the hard, bitter head
of the philosopher next to him adds to the
force of the impression. He has a senti
mental, dreamy countenance. His large
eyes and the ring on his elegant and
graceiul hand are of a deep, deep blue.
In the other rooms on this floor are Gains
borougns and Sir Joshua Reynolds galore,
not any of them speciall}' remarkable.
Most of the portraits have more of his
torical than artistic interest. There are
whole regiments of officers â admirals and
generals â standing with their hands on
their swords, black storms raging in the
background and miniature gory battles
being fought out behind them.
On the first landing are two beautiful
portraits, one of John Philip Kemble as
the noble Dane, the other of his sister,
Mrs. Siddons, reading aloud to an imag
inary audience. The one of Hamlet is
striking. The fine, dark head of Kemble
must have needed but little manipulation
to have made him the ideal of the gloomy
Dane.
In another room we have two smaller
portraits, one by Gilbert Stuart, the other
the well-known portrait of Mrs. Siddons
by Beechey. The two heads have a strong
family lifceness, the eyes very large, long
and black as velvet, the nose very deli
cately aquiline, the mouth strongly cv rved
and very rich in color. The one of Mrs.
Siddons is taken before the period of her
greatest triumphs, but after that mar
velous performance as Portia in "The
Merchant of Venice" with Garrick as Shy
lock. Garrick himself glooms very fat
and fierce from under an adjacent frame.
Now the heart begins to beat, as every
portrait becomes more and more familiar.
Here we have the Right Hon. Mr. Pitt,
Prime Minister, a beardless youth of 25.
Here are Sheridan and Burke and
Warren Hastings fighting out their old
battles together.
Ne.'.r them hangs Charles James Fox in
a canary waistcoat, with a large shovel
hat, and a precious old scoundrel he
looks!
Here we have a portrait of the Hon.
Miss Darner, who married the son of Lord
Milton, but, the old chronicles inform u--,
"the union was not happy, as she was
suddenly left a widow," which is certainly
a suggestive bit of information.
What a company we have here: Wesley
the basket's contents, and jelly and a
book. For this invalid there was a bnnch
of long-stemmed roses of creamy tint, and
as she held them close she told how last

was in tlie country a week once," she told
us. "and I could have brought home a
plant, but it would die in this dark place."

KING HENRY VII, FROM AN OLD PORTRAIT.
A few months ago this was a happy
family, with a strong hand to labor. First
a baby boy died and the father grieved
deeply â so deeply it seemed to tell on his
health. Then he took a severe cold, which
turned into quick consumption, and in six
weeks he had found his little son.
Now the two girls and the mother and
the coming infant
have a hard struggle
before them for a
month or two until
the mother is again
able to work. They
were about to be
turned into the street
on account of failure
to pay the $6 for their
miserable rooms, and
the little one whose
eyes are to open on a
world of sadness and
struggle would have
been still more desti
tute but for the mis
sion.
The girls brought a
complete wardrobe,
and promised a nice
heavy basket every
Thursday for several
week 3.
One of the little
girls talked to the
young maid about
her father and how
lonely it was at din
ner time because he
didn't come. "I
know he won't ever
come," the little voice
went on. "He's gone
to where baby broth
er is, but I'm lone
some."
Take these three
cases as a sample of
the work of the Fruit
and Flower Mission
and think whether
the charity is a small
or narrow one. The
girls who take the
basKOts are not poor.
Is it not true charity
that takes them in
person, rain or shint,
among the sick every Thursday?
It is easier to throw a dollar at the poor
than to take o:ie day out of every week to
minister to them. Does it seem a small
thing to go once a week? Try it yourself,
you who are above want. Give one day
out of seven to serving your brothers
whose need is great; give it year after
year, admitting no excuse, and then an
swer whether it is a little tiling to do.

"Oh, yes," said the maid from the mis
sion, "we go every Thursday. The week
would be all wrong if we did not. Of course
all who belong do not go; there are al
ways some in a society who shirk, but
the real workers of the mission are very
steady."
Before I tell of the hospital work I must
lay before you the needs of the mission.
There is money on hand from a bequest,
but the principal is being U3ed all the
time and the expense is considerable.
The mission needs fruit. It is a shame
that now, while fruit is rotting on the
ground and being dumped into the bay or
fed to hogs, the Fruit and Flower Mission
has to send canned fruit and jellies to the
sick or the poor. It is doubly a shame be
cause the charity n eed cost the donor
nothing.
Wells-Fargo will take free of all charge
any boxes addressed to the mission and
will return the boxes afterward. Think
of that when your fruit is going to waste,
and take time to pack a few boxes. Your
purse will not be the emptier for a thought
of others. If the time is too precious set
the half-grown children at it and kill two
birds with one stone. It will help the sick
and it will be teaching the children the
beautiful lesson of unselfishness, of giving
of their abundance to the unfortunate.
Children are naturally loving and if you
tell them the story of sick children in darfi
rooms who need those juicy pears and
peaches, they will trot their little legs
weary and take a tender note in their
voices as they pack fruit for "poor, sick,
little girls and boys."
Wholesale fruit merchants when over
stocked might send many a box, and it
would buy them a penny's worth of para
dise without in the least decreasing their
profits. The fruit would go to a class who
could not buy it.
Half- worn shoes and outgrown garments
for children are always in demand. And
baby clothes. This is a tender subject,
but truth is tender as well. Helpless
childhood in need is one of the greatest of
wrongs. The mother whose baby has
gone away and left the dainty garments
to be bedewed with tears ha 3no riebt to
lay them away so long as other babes as
pure and innocent yet as hers are coming
into the world to find no covering. The
little clothes seem sacred, and they are
sacred â sacred enough for an angel's mis
sion. Give them away ! Take them your
self, if you will, and in drawing the
scented folds over the body of some child
born into poverty and sm feel the pain in
your heart melting into a broader mother
love for all little ones.
Books and cheerful magazines and pa
pers are needed always; and remember
that Walls- Fargo will carry them free.

Here is another big portrait of a very
small and frightened looking Warren
Hastings, taken from the Government
House in Calcutta. He has very delicate
sensiiive features, and is a very siender,
little man, with a mild and timid expres
sion; he shrinks into his chair in all the
simplicity of black knee breeches and a
checked waistcoat and a very limp frill.
Perhaps he looks more diminutive through
the overpowering grandeur of his neigh
bor, Sir Arthur Onslow, who is some nine
feet tall, with all the dignity of velvet
robes and gold trimmings.

hardly more than a glance.
Here are the poor little children of un
happy JameÃ II and Mary of Modena;
Prince James, the little "Chevalier de St.
George," the "Old Pretender" and his
sister. He is a very young prentender at
this time, with his hand on a magnificent
greyhound, and the other little gloved
list held out to the diminutive Princess
Louise, his little frerh face very grave, his
head held with a high childish self-posses
sion. Poor iittle picturesque, tragic
figure!
There is Catherine of Braganza, who
seems to have consoled herself for the neg
lect she suffered from at the court of King
Charles by having her portrait painted
with great spirit and frequency. She is
here represented as Queen Cleopatra In
the act of dissolving a pearl. Near her
hangs her rival, the popular "Nell
Gwynne," with her attractive, intelligent,
animated face.
Here all ranks are leveled and we find
Nance Oldfleld, the immortal Lady Betty
Modish, smiling with a delicate brilliancy
over the head of the Duke of Marl borough.
And, Betty, give this cheek a little red,
one would sot, sure, be frightful when one's dead!
The young, rosy cheek needed no red
at the time of this portrait; there were no
suggestions then of the grewsome day
when, white as marble, she would be con
signed to Westminster Abbey all in Brus
sels lace and gloves as she had com
manded.

crown and flowers on his curling wig.
Henry VII is a fine old Flemish portrait.
It is not hard to see where the highly

Flemish masters.

London, July 25.
The next Thursday, armed with two
baskets full of spoils from the garden, 1
again sought the mission with entirely
different ideas and sure of a welcome.
The same girls were going with fruit,
flowers and books to the City and County
Hospital. Six baskets of flowers were
taken and the fruit and books sent ahead.
One basket was especially beautiful with
roses. It came from two young lady
florists up on Sutter street, who are very
kind. Do you believe in signs ? I do. I
think those roses were a sign of great
future success for those florists. I confess
I was a little skeptical about the good of
hospital visiting with flowers. The bigotry
of ignorance !
Without any sentiment, but with
cheery friendliness, the girls went from
bed to bed giving a pear and a few pieces
of candy to each patient and offering the
books and flowers. Evsry face turned to
them; eyes which were closed opened and
brightened; every hand re ached for the
offered flower. Perhaps when well these
men cared nothing for flowers, and, con
sidered merely as flowers, perhaps they
cared nothing for them when ill, but there,
with the friendly face and the friendly
word, the flower was a symbol. It was a
sign that "somebody cares." Many a
workingman will, in the future, see in the
heart of every flower that grows a
pair of brown eyes that looked at
him as the maid from the mission hoped
he would be welt by next week. Every
man, except the very ill and the two who
were cross, took a flower, and three who
were overlooked called the girls back. As
long as they were passing up and down,
the wan faces followed them. The manner
of the patients was the same all over the
place. The girls are welcome and they
know it. "They are glad to see us," ex
claimed the young matron, "though they
do not gush. Poor men, I don't want
them to be overwhelmed with gratitude
for a little thing like this. The way some
of them look up and say 'than* you'
would pay for more than we can do."
No girl would go out there weÂ«k after
week and walk miles up and down the
wards, loosing at pale and dying faces aad
offer smiles and encouragement, just for
effect. The patients know tiiis. They
grow used to the faces and look for them,
and when they are getting better they are
glad to confide it to the decided little
matron and hear her hearty, "I'm so
glad I"
As I rode home with my two big empty
market baskets the funny boy may have
grinned at me for going about looking like
a peddler. I would rather carry baskets
for the Flower Mission than wear the
robes of a society queen.
Oliti Hetdbt.Tl^e Real Discoverers
of Silver in .Nevada
Gkapter From Piorveer History Gor\cerr\ir\g
JWo prospectors WKo Qamered
Not the Fruits of JKeir Fir\d
Forty-seven years ago to-day two young
men landed in San Francisco, unnoticed
members of the great gold rush, who,
nevertheless, deserve to be remembered
by the entire Pacific Coast as the real
discoverers of ttie silver mines of Washoe.
Their experiences in San Francisco, in the
Californian mines and in Western Utah
(now Nevada) form a very interesting
chapter of pioneer history, and have been
recently brought to my mind by receiving
from Dr. K. M. Bucke, a prominent Cana
dian physician, his manuscript narrative
of the adventures of these two prospectors,
the Grosh brothers.
Many old mining men and speculators
will recollect the excitement caused on the
Comstock when the heirs of the Groshes
laid claim to tne ownership of a large part
of the famous group of great mines on the
ground that those two plucky Californian
prospectors had found and perfected their
titles thereto.
Dr. Bucke's authority to speak for the
Grosh brothers is derived from his per
sonal relations to them and their family.
He mined and prospected with them, or
near them, in Gold Canyon, and they
were on terms of mutual intimacy and
confidence. In his own words he took
part in "many of the scenes and incidents Â»
of their eventful lives and deaths." Not |
trusting to lapsing memory he toot notes !
at the time, or soon after, of the various j
occurrences to be herein retold, and he 1
â was afterward shown all of the letters
written by E. A. and H. B. Grosh to their
father, from the time they left home in
1849 until their deaths in 1857. With such
a faithful and intelligent biographer
ready and willing ail these years to give
information about the Groshes it is, to say
the least, a curious fact that nearly all
those who have written of the period have
been contented to gather up and tell over
and over again the misleading and frag
mentary surface traditions.
The interest of the Grosh episode, as
especially typical of the real toils and
dangers of pioneer mining life, has, there
fore, in some way, missed its fair expres
sion. The antagonisms their names once
aroused are long ago ended, and it is time
to give them their proper place in the
mining history of tbe Pacific Coast.
Ethan Allen Grosh, born in 1824, and
Hosea Ballou Grosh, born in 1826, both in
Marietta, Pa., were the sons of a quite
prominent Universalist minister. The
family moved to Utica, N. V., and thence
to Reading, Pa., where the boys were
living when tbe discovery of gold in Cali
fornia led them to join a company of forty
men, who started for the new El Dorado
from Chestnut-street wharf, Philadelphia,
February 28, 1849, in the schooner Newton,
CaDtain George H. Smith, clearing for
Tampico, Mexico. (C. W. Haskins in his
"Argonauts of '49" gives the date of this
departure a3 March 1.) The company
were mostly young and not very well
provided for the journey before them.
Among those whose names will be re
membered by many Californians was
Robert Farrelly. Thomas Diehl, S. M.
Dane, Captain McDowell and Robert Rob
inscn, but the modest, Newton expedition
ws3 only one out of more than a hundred
which set sail from various ports that
eventful spring of 1849.
The Newton had excellent weathet until
within sixty miles of Tampico, when j
every one was making ready to co for the
land journey across Mexico. A violent
storm, however, drove them out to sea,
and five days were lost in beating back to
Tampico. They landed and spent a fort-
Eight in outfitting, under th? leadership
of Captain J. R. West, to whom they had j
each paid to land them in San Francisco, i
The expedition started from Tampico for
San Bias, on the Pacific Coast, April 10.
Dr. Buclce says that the journey "seems
to have had nearly all the unpleasantness
and drawbacks that such a journey could
li.-tve and still be finally accomplished."
Water was scarce in tbe hot, barren coun
try over which the forty Argonauts passed.
Their mules and horses often strayed and
many were not recovered. West's out
fitting had been extremely parsimonious.
Tne fleas, sand flies, mosquitoes and other
insect pests drove men and animals nearly
wild. Long before the luckless expedition
reached the Pacific many of its members
were sick with malarial fevers, dysentery
and other disorders. Lastly, to cap the j
climax, Captain West, who had foolishly j
been paid in advance to take them to San I
Francisco, went to pieces financially and J
disappears from the story, leaving many |
of his unfortunate victims nearly penni
less, as one and all had expected to pick
up money by the bushel in golden Cali
fornia.
The forty, however, took possession of
West's horses, mules, wagons, harness
and whatever assets were in sight, and
managed to reach San Bias on June 23.
When the mail steamer Panama came
along two or three of the pilgrims had
money enough to pay their fares to San
Francisco. Beveral stayed in Mexico, but
moit of them, including the Grosh
brothers, managed to keep soul and* body
together in this forlorn little Mexican town
until about the middle of July tne bark
Olga of Boston took them aboard on pay
ment of what money they had, permit
ting them to work out the rest in stern
sea fashion, before the mast. This
brought them to San Francisco, August
30. 1849.
After the Grosh brothers reached San
Francisco one of them was long very ill ;
the other obtained work in a. store and
took care of him. His letters during the
last four months of 1849 give most realistic
pen-pictures of pioneer San Francisco.
The town was built of rough boards and
fog-stained canvas; the streets were un
paved and nearly impassable after the
rains began; gambling-houses abounded;
shooting and stabbing were matters of
daily occurrence. The prices charged by
the storekeepers were a source of shocked
amazement. Potatoes were 35 cents a
pound, onions $1 25 a pouna, and cost of
other vegetables was "only limited by
the conscience of the dealers and the
means of the buyers." Eggs brought
$6 per dozen ; sweet potatoes and squashes
sold for from $2 50 to $5 apiece. Plain,
common farm boots brought s32 and better

grades were rated at from $60 to $90. Tbis
was written in a letter of December 1,
1849, and in January, 1850, they gave an
other list of Drices, as follows: Fresh
beef, 20 cents per pound; veal, 50 cents;
pork, 75 cents; mutton, $4 a quarter;
bread, 25 to 50 cents a small loaf; butter,
$150 a pound: dried peaches and apples,
$1. All other articles in like proportion.
A small shanty in the outskirts of the
City rented for $250 per month, and prices
increased very rapidly toward the busi
ness center, where light, frail houses of
one or two stories on small lots sometimes
rented for $50, $80 or even $100 a day.
By June, 1850, these hard-working
Grosh brothers, having saved a little from
their clerking in stores, were on their way
at last to the mines, like thousands of
others. As described by Dr. Bucke, they
were of medium height, slight figures,
good looking, fairly well educated, quick
of observation, ready with expedients,
thoroughly honest and honorable in small
things as in great, absolutely devoted to
one another, industrious, persevering,
manly and fearless. In all respects they
were men who deserved success.
The Grosh boys began their career as
prospectors in the Coloma district, El
Dorado County, and made $2000 or $3000
above expenses in tr.e first year after
reacn mg the mines. Then they joined an
association to turn a river and mine the
bottom of the channel.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars had
been made this way, the gold being scooped
up by the pound from the bedrock in some
cases; but the Groshes lost every cent
they had in the world. Then they picked
up a few dollars "crevicing," and spent it
" grub-staking " themselves on various
prospecting tours. Abandoning the placers
for a time they hunted for quartz veins.
LiKe every one else in the mines, they felt
the charm of the outdoor life, and their
letters show how much they loved it.
Allen was offered a position to write for
the Pacific News at $75 a week, and Hosea
wÂ«*s offered $300 a month to go into a
store, but they were born prospectors and
could not abandon tneir chosen occupa
tion.
Through 1851 and 1852 they staid in the
El Dorado mines, working placer claims
to pay their expenses, and looking for
quartz. Part of the time they tried a
small stock ranch, but met with misfor
tunes, and in July, 1853, decided to cross
the Sierras into Western Utah, from which
region came rumors of new placers. They
prospected for gold in Lake Valley at the
head of Tahoe, and at many places on tbe
way, finding nothing of value. They
settled down at last in Gold Canyon, above
Dayton, where a few Mormons and wan
dering prospectors were making a precari
ous living In ravines below the as yet un
discovered Comstock le Iges.
In the autumn of 1854 the Groshes went
back to El Dorado and mined for a time
at Little Sugar Loaf. Their bad luck con
tinued. "In fact," says Dr. Bucke, "they
do not seem to have had any other kind
of luck all their uves. They still just
made enough to keep themselves alive."
They wrote to their lather from El Dorado
in March, 1856, however, and gave the
firtt glimpse of then unknown silver
ledges: "Ever since our return from Utah
we have been trying to get a couple of hun
dred dollars together for the purpose of
making a careful examination of a silver
lead in Gold Canyon." Native silver, they
said, was found there, but the ignorant
placer miners thou.ht it was lead. In
spite of strenuous efforts, they remained
$100 in debt, and finally went to Western
Utah in September, 1858, illy provided,
but determined to develop several pros
pects.
They worked a few weeks and returning
to Ei Dorado to winter wrote : "We found
two veins of silver at the forks of Gold

Canyon. One of these is a perfect mon
ster." Their winter's mining in El Do
rado was a complete failure, and almost
penniless they toiled for the third time
across the great Sierra heights carrying
their scanty outfits. A long letter, under
date of June 8, describes with much detail
the progress of their quartz discoveries,
giving a diagram which makes it seem
certain to one who has studied the subject
that they were really prospecting the
South End mines of the Comstock at Gold
Hill, or near it.
The half-interest grub-staker had not
yet developed on the Pacific Coast, but
what an opportunity these struggling
prospectors would have gladly given to
any San Francisco or Sacramento mer
chants two years or more before the great
rush to Washoe and Comstock's famous
properties. "Our first assay," writes Allen
Grosh in August, "gave $3500 in silver to
the ton." This seemed to them too good
to be believed, and they much preferred
another ledge which assayed $200 per ton.
The rest of the story of tne Grosh broth
ers has become a part of the mining his
tory of the Pacific Coast. In August, 1857,
Hosea wounded himself with a pick and
died from blood-poisoning. Allen and his
friend Dr. Bucke attempted to cross the
Sierras late in the season, were caught in
the grip of winter, struggled on for days,
and finally, frost-bitten, crippled, reached
Last Chance camp in El Dorado. There
Allen Grosh died. His documents were
lost in the Sierras, and when the Com
stock was rediscovered and the great
Washoe excitement began his relatives
were unable to justify his claims in the
courts. But the fact remains, now gener
ally recognized, that these two patient,
plodding, unfortunate Californian pros
pectors, the Grosh brothers, did really
find tne silver of Nevada, though tb.6y
failed, through no fault of their own, to
reap the fruitaee of their victory.

FIESTA OF
TEMECULA INDIANS
AT SAN DIEGO.
In Ban Dieso County every year
the Temecula Indians have a fiesta.
It promises to be bigger this year than
ever. Runners have been sent out to all
the reservations and rancheriaÃ, from
Saboba to Santa Catarina, and all the
bucks and belles will be there. The festiv
ities began at Temecula yesterday and
will last as long as there is anything left
of the wassail and wampum.
There are many fiestas among the San
Diego County Indians during the year.
The Temecula fiesta and that of San Luis
Rey take the prize for long-drawn festiv
ity and dancing. The San Luis Rey fiesta
has its headquarters at Pala, but it spreads
during the time of greatest virulence and
takes in the Cuca, Rincon, San Dieguito,
Aqua Caliente and all up and down the'
San Luis Rey River.
At Temecula horseraces are the princi
pal diversion. There are plenty of Indians
through that country who own horses,
and good ones, too. Then the Mexican
rancheros take a hand themselves, their
young vaqueros esteeming it a great
honor to win the race against the supple
and wiry young bucks. All that the
riders have to hold on with is a strap
around the sleex and steaming body of
the bronco and a hair lariat slung around
the lower jaw of their mount. Money,
ponies, lariats, saddles, shotguns, hunt

The Three Jailors.
Three little tailors, to have a good time
Went to the tavern of Ingolheim,
On the Rhine, on the Rnine.
Their pockets were empty, but still they nursed
The hope that someone would quench their thirst!
With wine, with wine.
"Sir host, we are broke, we have not a cent-
In seeing the world our gold we've spent
On the Rhine, on the Rhine.
But come, we'll show you some wonderful tricks'
In return we ask you give us for nix
Some wine, some wine. "
"Ye fellows! the keeper of Incelheini
Will sell you a glass of wine for a dime,
On the Rhine, on the Rhine.
But for all your tricks with needle and thread
A punch on the head he'll give you, instead
Oi wine, of wine."
A sunbeam one of them caught In his bat
And nimbly threaded his needle with mat!
Uti the Rhine, on the Rhine.
A broken wine glass he sewed with the bean
Ho well that no one could see the seam,
In wine, in wine.
The second tailor caught bold of a gnat
As on the bridge of his nose he squat,
On tbe Rhine, on the Rbine.
Tbe gnat wore socks with a hole line a dot;
lie darned it so finely you noticed It not,
For wine, for wine.
His needle of steel the third one grabbedâ
With all his might in the wall he stabbed,
Ou the Rhine, on the Rhine.
A lightning Hash through the needle eye slippedâ
I saw the wonrt-r myself while I sipped
My wine, my wine.
The host of Ingelheim said: "I see
Tbe truest, smartest men of you three,
On the Rhine, on he Rhine."
A thimble he took ana rilleu to the brim,
And laughingly said: "Now, boys, take a swim
In wine, in wine!"

.NOVEL WAY TO
GET RID OF STREET
BEGGARS.
There is a gentleman of this City who is
so fortunate as to be able to converse in
several languages besides English, and
has the remarkable faculty of speaking
each without an accent foreign to that
language; in fact, his accentuation of the
language he chooses is so perfect that he
is frequently mistaken for a native of the
country in which the language is the
mother tongue. He has adopted a novel
way of ridding himself ofthe importunities
of the professional striker. When he is
stopped or approached by one of the class
he talks to the fellow in a foreign tongue
and it is not long before the importunities
cease.
A few days since this gentleman was
on Kearny street when a tall specimen of
the mendicant class, whose breath was
strong with the fumes of liquor, stepped
up to him and asked for a dime to get a
meal.
â¢'Que voulez-vous?" politely asked the
gentleman turning toward the fellow.
Tbe beggar looked amazed for a mo
ment, but he repeated his question and he
received another retort in French from
the gentleman, who moved on about his
business, but the fellow followed him and,
after repeating his demand half a dozen
times without producing the desired
effect, he exclaimed in disgust, "What in
thunder is the matter with you? I can't
understand a word you say." Then in a
moment he added, "Say, you old bloke,
what are you doing in this country, any
how, if you can't talk English?"
The gentleman has tried this a dozen
times or more of late, and as he has not
been annoyed by one of these beggars for
more than a week, although he has passed
many of them, he has come to the conclu
sion that "de gantr is onto him" and will
let him alone in future.

The Hungarian crown, the royal head

Austrian iSmperors, is the identical one
made for Stephen and used by him at tbe
time of his coronation, more than 800 years
ago. It is of pure gold, and weighs nine
marks and six ounces (about fourteen
pounds avoirdupois). It is adorned with
fifty-three sapphires, fifty rubies, one em
erald and 338 pearls, but no diamonds, it
being a notion of the royal Stephen that
diamonds were unlucky.

One of Six Survivors
of the War of 1812
Jiosea BroWn's Ev>er\tful Gareer of More
Than a Gerxtury â The Story
The men or women now living at the
age of 84 years were in their cradles or in
their nurse's arms when the war of 1812
commenced. And there are very few of
any age now living who have any distinct
recollection of the events that took place
during our second war with Great Britain.
How much more remarkable then must
the fact seem when the statement is made
that there are five or six actual partici
pants of that war still surviving and regu
larly in receipt of pensions from the
United States.
Among this latter number is Hosea
Brow,n, now residing near Grants Pass,
Or. He was born July 18, 1792, in the
town of Westmoreland, Cheshire County,
N. H., and is now in his one hundred and
fifth year. His father was a soldier in the
Revolutionary War and was wounded
in one of the early engagements near
Boston. Hosea was one of thirteen chil
dren and comes from a long-lived race,
two of his brothers having reached tbe
ages of 90 and 93 years. His early educa
tional advantages were limited according
to the appointments of a century ago.
From the time be was 9 years of age and
for a period of ten years after he
attended the ordinary loghouse school
three months during the winter
HOSEA BROWN, THE CENTENARIAN.
of each year, at all other times
helping to clear and cultivate the farm,
upon the proceeds of which the entire
family depended for the necessaries of
life. On reaching his twentieth year his
father "gave him his time" and a little
money. With these and a still further
capital, consisting of hope and independ
ence, he went to Onondaga County, N. V.,
where he worked as a farm laborer for the
sum of $12 a month.
He was nearly 20 years of age when the
war of 1812 was declared against Great
Britain, and less than a year later he was
enrolled as a private in Captain E. Bur
giss' company of New York Volunteers
and marched to the defense of Sacketts
Harbor, on Lake Ontario, which had been
greatly weakened by the withdrawal of
much of our land and naval force for the
expedition against York, and which
proved so successful to the American
cause. As soon as the comparatively de
fenseless condition of Sacketts Harbor
was known to the enemy an attack by the
British under Sir George Provost, Gov
ernor-General of Canada, was planned to
take place May 28, 1813. Troops to the
number of about 1200 were embarked in
small boats from tbe enemy's ships and,
re-enforced by a considerable body of In
dians in canoes, started for the shore.
This movement was temporarily discon
certed by the unexpected appearance of
a large number of small boats, in which
were a part of a regiment of our troops,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Aspin
wall, who were hastening from Oswego to
the relief of the garrison at Sacketts
Harbor. These latter were attacked by
the British in overwhelming numbers,
who captured twelve boats and seventy
men, but by vigorously plying their
oars the remainder effected a landing ana
added about 100 men to the effective force
at the harbor.
During that night the enemy landed a
party of Indians and by making a detonr
hoped to attack the militia, which consti
tuted our reserve, in the rear, but in this
they were frustrated.
At dawn the next morning the British,
in trying to land thirty-three boats filled
with armed troops, were met with a scat
tering fire from our militia, to which the
guns of the enemy's vessels responded
and under cover of which the enemy suc
ceeded in gaining a landing, after which
they formed in line and returned our fire
instantly, killing Colonel Mills. This cir
cumstance, coupled with the sounds of
musketry and great guns and the screan
of solid shot and swishing of bullets, al
though causing no havoc in the ranks,
created consternation among our un
trained troops and caused them to retreat
in panic-stricken confusion. In fact it
was nothing but a disgraceful act of
cowardice on the part of the rank and file
in which the officers participated.
It is related of one of the militia com
manders, who had talked very valiantly,
that be became less valiant as he saw the
enemy's boats approach the shore. As
they came forward in a swarm he became
less and less hopeful, until at length he
told his men that he doubted tae ability
of the American force to cope with the
enemy. "I fear we shall ba compelled to
retreat," he said. After a pause he con
tinued, "I know we shall, and as lam a
little lame I'll start now." and away he
went as faÃt as his legs could carry him.
The American commander (who by the
way was a General Brown), stung by this
disgraceful conduct, used every exertion
to rally tbe fugitives but without success,
they not even stopping to retire in the
shelter of some woods on their route, and
in which they were to halt and re-form in
the event of being forced to give way.
of His Life
An honorable exception to this ignoble
flight was the command to which Hosea
Brown belonged. It stood with unflinch
ing courage, maintaining its position and
blazing away at the hated enemy with good
effect. But our smaller force was gradually
made weaker by losses, and, wearied
by constant efforts to stand their ground,
was compelled to at last fall back and
take refuge in some log barracks. Their
position here was extremely hazardous,
and it appeared that the enemy's des
perate efforts to dislodge them would soon
prove successful unless relief came. In
this emergency General Brown attempted
to rally tbe fugitive militia by sending out
messengers informing them of the enemy's
repulse. This stratagem had its desired
effect, and several hundred were collected
and formed in broken lines a mile or
more from where the engagement was
still raging. Here General Brown ad
dressed them, loading them with re
proaches for their lack of courage and de
claring he would have every one shot if
they further failed in their duty. His
manner awed them, and they asked to be
led into the fight. This was done, and
more than 200, led by intrepid officers,
gallantly attacked the enemy, and by their
heroism not only redeemed themselves
but covered themselves with glory by con
verting an almost certain disaster into a
glorious victory.
After completing his term of service
Hosea Brown returned to his old home,
and at the age of 24 married Miss Hester
Smith and became the father of two boys
and three girls. In 1825 he moved to Cat
taraugus County, New York, where he ar
rived in March, and after discharging his
obligations had ]ust 18 cents for a working
capital. Here he took up land and built a
cabin. He cleared and cultivated land by
the light of the moon and during the day
worked for neighbors, sometimes thresh
ing grain with a flail and receiving in pay
ment for his labor every tenth bushel.
But he prospered sufficiently to be con
tent, and in this spot he lived for forty
years. Losing by death his entire family
â his wife, the companion of his early
trials and hardships, dying in 1857 â he
"went out to Missouri," and for a time
stopped in Worth County. Not having
any one to look after his little property,
in the centennial year he disposed of it
and moved to the home of his grandson,
Orr Brown, with whom he now lives.
At the last Federal election in 1892 the
old soldier was placed in a chair, and, es
corted by a band of music, was carried to
the polls, where he cast his vote for Harri
son. In politics he has never been any
thing but Federalist, Whig and Republi
can. While in the enjoyment of most ex
cellent health he has not walked for over
three years. His mind is still vigorous
and his memory good, for he relates with
exactness many events that took place a
century ago, and he reads without glasses.
A most remarkable thing has happened
to him during the past year. His hair,
which up to that period was silvery white,
began to turn, and it has since become as
black as it was in his early manhood.
Under the original pension law made
for the benefit of all surviving soldiers of
the war of 1812 he received $8 per month,
which was increased by the act of March
19, 1886, to $12. By a special act of Con
gress on March 3, 1891, he was granted a
pension of $40 per month by reason of ex
treme old age, and on the 21st of March,
1895, through the efforts of Congressman
Binger Hermann, his pension was
further increased to $50 per month. As
Hosea Brown is the oldest hurviving sol
dier in the United States, the clerks of the
Pension Office take especial pleasure in
preparing his voucher and remitting the
amount due him quarterly before any
other payment is made. Thus this more
than centenarian, nearly thirty- five years
after passing the "three score and ten" of
allotted life, finds himself surrounded by
relatives and friends, who tenderly admin
ister to his comfort, while a grateful Gov
ernment is not unmindful of his pas
services in its defense, but liberally fur
nishes the means whereby its oldest sur
viving soldier may have an abundance to
make comfortable his last days of life.
DEPOSITIONS
TALKED INTO THIS
MAGHINE .
The graphophone play 3 an important
feature in the speedy reproduction of the
very long depositions in the Fair will con
test. As this is something new in San
Francisco, or new at least in this applica
tion, some little description may be of in
terest. The notes of tbe stenographers
are taken on the ordinary plan and they
must be transcribed by typewriters. The
graphophone is an intermediary. When
a stenographer comes in with a book of
notes he sits down in front of a machine,
the most striking portions of which are a
revolving cylinder and a mouth trumpet
at the end of a flexible tube. The revolv
ing cylinder is covered with gelatine, so
sensitive that it will faithfully record and
reproduce all the inflections and enuncia
tions possible to tbe human voice, the
only limit being that the speed must not
be so great that the enunciation fails of
distinctness. The stenographer reads his
notes into this machine at a speed of from
150 to 200 words per minute. Then he
turns the cylinders over to the custody of
the typewriter. The last-named places
the cylinders in rotation in another ma
chine and applies ear-trumpets to
his ears. The cylinders are made to
revolve, and as he sits at the machine tbe
typewriter has the depositions spoken as
directly into his ears as if he were in the
room where they were taken. He hears
every question and every answer verbatim.
He has a brake by which the speed of the
revolving cylinders may be regulated. He
has no notes to decipher. His function is
to listen and to work the typewriter at
top speed. This is the way the Fair depo
sitions are speeded to the attorneys and
others interested in the case.
POINTERS
FROM A CHINESE
GUIDEBOOK,
News comes from Paris that Li Hang
Chang has extended invitations to certain
eminent Frenchmen to visit him in Pe
king f and, as it is quite probable that the
distinguished Viceroy will extend similar
invitations to such Americans as may
take his fancy, it has seemed advisable to
the New York Herald to cull from a Chi
nese guidebook a few phrases for the guid
ance of such fortunate Americans.
There are in this country as good lin
guists as there are anywhere else, but
neither here nor in any oilier country, ex
cept China, are there many men who
know even the first rudiments ot the Chi
nese language. Some of the following
phrases, too, may prove useful to those
who may be introduced to the Viceroy
when he comes to this country, and who
may be inspired with the laudable desire
to show him that they are not utterly
ignorant of his mother tongue.

SOME USEFUL HINTS.
When he goes to pay his respects to any
Chinese gentleman the American visitor
must say, "Ouo lai kei-ni ts'ing-an."
When he expresses a desire to know what
places in the Chinese capital are worth
seeing, the answer will beâ â¢'Kou-toung
p'ou; n'a-eui ni k'o-y houan-kia. Hai
ye'oti tien-tan, ti-t'an, kouan-sing-I'ai,
kouo-tseu-kien, Mei-chan, Pei-t'aug teng
tch'ou."
When he goes to a theater and exclaims,
"What a pretty actress!" (Ah yah! tche
che y'ko hao k-an-ti niu-eul meun), n'
will be told that the pretty performer ia
not a woman, but a man dressed in
woman's clothes, as in China women are
forbidden to perform in public (Pou che
y-ko mu-eul-meun, tshe che y-ko nan
jen tahouang niu-eul-meun-ti-ta-pan,
tchao lu-li pon tchoun niu-eul-meun
tch-ang tchi).
Finally, when he asks at the close of the
day how persons spend the evening in
Peking (Tsai Pel-king, ouan-chang yeou
che-mo k'o tso-ti ?) he will be told that
they go to bed early and sleep heartily
(Tst chang ten' ouang tsiou choui
kiao).
Few of the above phrases relate to
women, for the reason that Chinese
gentlemen do not expect foreigners to be
tray any solicitude about the wel
fare of their female relatives. In
deed a foreigner who should in
quire as to their health would be guilty
of a grave breach of etiquette. On the
other hand, Chinese gentlemen know
that we are less exclusive in this respect
than they are, and they do not hesitate to
speak in high praise of the women of
Europe and America. Of French women
they speak rapturously, dwelling with en
thusiasm on the beauty of "their cherry
lips, their hair like black clouds, their
somber, mysterious. eyes, their small feet,
their perfect forms, their akin, white aa
snow, and their stately walk, which re
minds them of bamboos stirred by the
evening breeze."
HoW to Li\te to Qreat Age.
The latest fad in England is to insure
longevity through the use of a special diet.
The promise is held out to those who im
plicitly follow out the prescribed regimen
that they may attain to tbe ape of 110
years. This, among the most melancholy
people of the globe and to whom one
would fancy that life were the less worth
living, has aroused considerable enthusi
asm. Cooks and kitchens are to be abol
ished, meats, bread and vegetables are for
bidden; existence is to be main
tained exclusively upon nuts and ba
nanas. If we compare this with
the dietary system of Dickens, which
represents that of his period, his
comparatively oarly decease will excite no
surprise. According to English standards
he was an accomplished gastronome.
Beefsteak pudding was his ideal, a horri
ble concoction only fit for a crude or de
based palate. His highest conception of a
dinner was a baked leg of mutton with the
bone removed and the cavity filled with a
stuffing of oysters and veaL This was ac
companied with gin punch, in the making
of which Dickens took especial pride. It
was made as follows: A brass kettle of
water was heated over a spirit lamp.
When the water came to a boil it was
poured into a jug, with a bottle of old gin,
lumps of sugar and chips of lemon peel.
The mouth of the jug was then closed
with a napkin and tbe mixture allowed to
brew for a certain number of minutes.â

MIDSUMMER DAYS
AT THE RESORTS,
The Note for Departure
Has Not Yet Been
Sounded.
Elaborate Preparations Every
where Being Made for
the Close.
Entertaining Reports From the Sea
side, the Mountains, the Springs
and the Lakes.
Autumn is almost here and yet society shows
no disposition of returning to town and the
gayeties that make up City life. The reports
from the many fashionable resorts show a big
register. However there can be no doubt that
the out-of-door season will soon be over. But
the season is to close in a blaze of glory.
Everywhere elaborte preparations are being
made for the last days, and there can be no
doubt that the closing balls and hops and
various other amusements of the summer
hotels will far surpass the opening event of
what has proved an enjoyable and highly
profitable season. Annexed will be found the
whereabouts of our society people:
Mrs. J. A. Folger, Mr. Athearn Folger and
Mr. Ernest Folger have returned to Oakland,
after passing the season in San Rafael.
Mrs. N. G. Kittle and Mrs. W illiam Hinckley
Taylor have returned home, after a two weeks'
visit to Mr. and Mrs. George Davis Boyd in
San Rafael.
Mr. and Mrs. William Harvey Jardine, nee
Buckuall, who have been visiting relatives in
Scotland for the past year, are now in London.
They are expected home in December.
Miss Eloise Davis, daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Henry C. Davis, who experienced a severe ac

Estrella Parlor.
Estrella Parlor, N. 8. G. W., gave a very suc
cessful bazar in the Native Sons' Hall on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. A number
of interesting attractions, such as a '49 mining
camp, a fortune teller and other shows were
special inducements for the large number of
people present to spend their nickels and
dimes, wnrle the ice-cream and candy booths,
presided over by a bevy of exceptionally pretiy
girls, did a rushing business. The affair was
splendidly arranged and managed, and re
flects great credit upon the members of this
newly formed parlor.
The Wavj J-te Fixed the Bundle.
From the sign on bis delivery wagon
his name is Charley Ah Kern; his profes
sion is that of laondryman. His outfit
stood on Union street, near Fillmore, and
in a few moments Charley Ah Kern came
out of a large building which has the ap
pearance of a rooming-house. He was
loaded with bundles, so many of them
that when he reached the sidewalk he let
them drop.
Evidently being one of those creatures
who object to lifting large packages or
lifting weighty ones, he picked up the
bundles two at a time, one in each hand,
and carried them to his wagon. On a re
turn trip be discovered that he had
dropped a man's collar and one cuff; one
was white and the other pink, and as
he picked them up he seemed at a loss
to know which bundle they came from,
for he went back to his wagon and,
taking the two last thrown in, looked at
their contents, but did not appear to have
made up his mind into which one he
should place the articles he had picked
up. Once he concluded to put both in one
bundle, but he hesitated, and made a
movement to put them in the other; still,
he hesitated, and there was a look of
despair on bis countenance. In a mo
ment, however, that gave way to a smile;
he bad solved the difficulty. He placed
the cuff in one bundle and the collar in the
otber.
If it should happen that two of Charley
Ah Kern's customers each receive one pink
cuff this will explain how the goods be
came mixed.
Foresight
Without .Memory
A Strange Phenomenon Jreated
From a JheosopKical Poirvt
of VIeW.
To understand the explanation that
theosophy has to offer for a loss of mem
ory, accompanied by acquirement of
power to forecast future events, it is neces
sary to recopnize the fact that mind has
an existence apart from all brain action.
Many other phenomena that puzzle the
modern psychologist, such as trance,
thought-transference, mind-reading, clair
royance and hypnotism, are equally de
pendent on thiÃ fact for an explanation,
the theory of molecular change utterly
failing to account for them. Indeed, all
these phenomena may be claimed as evi
dence of tne independent existence of
mind.
Briefly, then, theosophy tells us that
man is a thinking soul who uses a physi
cal body in order that he may come into
touch with matter. Within the physical,
interpenetrating all.its parts, is an ethereal
form which serves as the link, or medi
um, between thought and brain. In other
words, mind has its true seat in the ethe
real form. What we usually call mind is
simply our ability to exercise intellig3nce
through the brain. If the brain be in
jured the thinker, or sonl, may be unable
to use it, just as a musician may be un
able to extract music from a worthless in
strument. The powers of each lie latent
for the time being.
It is also said that the soul has many
powers which are toosuhtleto be exercised
in brain tissue. But when brain action is
stilled, as in sleep, in trance and in some
forms of nervous affections, certain of these
powers are manifested. The ability to
forecast the future is one of the best known
of these powers and is allied to the abnor
mal mental perception of some hypno
tized subjects.
In the case of Franklin Hart it would
seem that the brain was partially be
numbed, perhaps temporarily, by asphyx
iatioD. The ethereal brain not sharing in
this condition still acts, and as it is not
now overpowered by the ruder vibrations
of the physical, is able to make its report.
The reason why he forgets the past is be
cause it related to his physical life which
registered its impressions on the physical
brain. As that is dulled it responds
slowly to mental effort, making it difficult
to recall those experiences.

NEAT STREET -CLEANERS.
Men in White Uniforms Now Sweep the
Sidewalks.
On account of the contract for street
sprinkling not having been let by the
Board of Supervisors a great quantity of
dirt, loose papers, etc., is^jlown upon the
sidewalks and into the doorways of the
stores. In the much frequented retail
j portion of the City this becomes a great
annoyance to the merchants and also to
the peopie passing alonjr, and to obviate
this as much as possible the Merchants'
i Association has, at its own expense, kept
men at work sweeping the sidewalks and
Dickinjr up the flying papers during the
busy part of ttie day.
In order that the sweepers may have a
neat appearance they will hereafter wear
the regulation New "York style of uniform
adopted by the Street Cleaning Depart
ment of that city. This consists of a
white duck blouse, trousers and cap to
match. Each roan will be provided with
two suits, so that when one becomes soiled
it may be left at home and washed and
the clean one worn.
This style of uniform for street-sweepers
in JNew York has bsen tried and met with
the unqualified approval of the residents
of that city and it is hoped that Si time
ban Irancisco may also have its army of
white-clad street-cleaners.
The advance guard of these sidewalk
cleaners made their appearance yesterday.
One was at work on Market street from
Sansome to Grant avenue. He cleans the
sidewalks on Montgomery, Kearny and
two blocks down Third as well. The other
men work on Market street from Grant
avenue to Seventh street and on Grant
avenue from Market to Post streets.
According to careful research there are
ol anarchist papers published in Europe
and America. One is Dutch, 10 German,
11 French, 8 Italian, 9 Spanish, 2 Spanish

6 English.

Bismarcks.
Peril Which Her Hushand, Lieut.
Kolbe, Endured From a
Poisoned Spear.
Queer Experiences Among the Dusky
Nativesâ Vast Cotton and Cocoa
Nut Plantations.
Queen Emma of the far Bismarck
islands, German New Guinea, and her
husband, Lieutenant Peter Kolbe, for
merly of the German navy, arrived here
yesterday and are at the Palace.
They nave been aosent on a tour of Eu
rope, and went from their island home
via the Suez canal, and returned by way
of New York and other parts of the East.
While in tbe East Queen Emma visited
her sister, Mrs. F. G. Malcolm, at Chat
ham, Mass., and was there accorded the
freedom of the city.
The notable lady is not a stranger to
Baa Franci-co, for she spent six years here
while receiving her education. One of her
teachers was Mrs. Dr. L. C. Lane of Cooper
College. Queen Emma is a cousin of King
Mataafa of Samoa. Her father was Jonas
M. Coe, who was for many years in the
early timÂ«!Â» United States Consul to Sa
moa. He married into the royal family,
his wife being a very handsome and un
usually accomplished woman.
Queen Emma has immense possessions
in the Bismarck Islands. Her fortune is
estimated at many millions. Her home is
on the Pommeranian Island of the Bis
marck group. Her island possession there
is so great that it takes four days of
steamer traveling to go round the island.
f?he owns many vessels, vast forests
of cocoanut trees and extensive planta
tions of cotton and coffee.
Over 700 natives are constantly em
ployed by her. In 1890 no less than 57,000
pounds of cotton were produced and the
crop has since then materially increased.
There are 40,000 cocoanut trees of the age
of 10 years and all producing handsomely.
A full-grown tree produces eighty nuts a
year, so it will be seen what an enormous
harvest there is to look alter. About 100
natives are employed on the vessels which
the Queen owns.
She has also in connection with her
husband, who is the manager of her vast
possessions, numerous stores. From these
are sold all kinds of goods used by the
dark-skinned natives.
Queen Emma is a rather tall lady, with
a full intellectual face, and with the raven
hair and dark eyes characteristic of the
distant islands of the Pacific. She spent
much time in shopping yesterday in com
pany with her relatives, Mrs. Edward H.
Coe and Miss Coe of 1909 Union street.
Lieutenant Kolbe, her husband, who is
a very pleasant gentleman, gives some in
teresting details in reference to life on the
Bismarck Islands.
'1 nere are about 200,000 natives on these
islands." said be, ''and the majority of
them are cannibals. They break out in
internecine war once in a while, and at
such times they are very formidable.
About three years ago there was a war
which lasted six months. We had to kill
off shout 10 per cent of those engaged in it
before it could be stopped.
"If they get prejudiced against you they
will make it hot. One of the chiefs at one
period offered a reward of about $250 for
my head. However, 1 have managed to
stay alive, and I may add I am in nowise
afraid of him. However, I was once
struck by a poisoned spear, and had a
chance for recovery that was by no means
the best. Still I survived. The scar is
here on my arm now.
"The natives all smoke tobacco. Even
the little children do this. The tobacco is
not grown there, and nearly all that is
used I import from the United States.
The cotton grown there is of fine quality.
I have been visiting some of tbe cotton
districts of the South lately in order to pet
information of vaiue to be put in use on
the Bismarck Islands.
"The Bismarck Islands consist mainly
of the New Pommeranian, New Mecklen
burg, New Hanover and New Louenburg
Queen Emma of the Bismarck Islands, German New Guinea, Her Hnsband,
Lieutenant Peter Kolbe, and Their Native Servant.

whole comprise about 47,000 square miles.
"It is a very interesting country in
which to live. The natives are mainly
black, but they really represent many
shades. The hair of some is straight,
while that of others is curly."
Mr. and Mrs. Kolbe have with them as
a servant a native woman of New Pom
merania. She is 20 years old, sable as
night and has hair so thick and curly that
the wonder of it is that so much can be
grown on a single head. She is the
daughter of one of the most famous island
chieftains, who was killed a few years ago.
She has been with Queen Emma nine
years. Her face is tattooed on each side,

have thought that the decision pointed to
a decision holding that the section of the
County Government act providing for
four-year terms applies to San Francisco,
but equally eminent authorities see no
such indications and say that the two
legal problems are entirely distinct.
Garret McEnerney, who is chief coun
sel in all of the three cases now pending
and involving this point, is one of those
taking this position. Those who are
anxious to know whether or not municipal
officers are to be elected this year will
simply have to await the Supreme Court
decisions, which may be handed down
within a few days or not for several weeks.
The new fee bill cuts several thousand
dollars off the income of the Sheriff,
and retains in the City treasury a larjre
amount of accumulated fees, which would
have been returned to the Sheriff if the
application of the law to San Francisco
had not been sustained.
"During my entire term," said Sheriff
Whelan yesterday, "I have, by the advice
of my attorneys, collected the fees pre
scribed by the old lay, but have observed
the method of collection prescribed in the j
nÂ«w law by turning them into the City
treasury. There is, therefore, not a dollar
due the City from me.
"The income of the Sheriffs office is re
duced by from $300 to $350 a month, but
during my term I have not collected these
fees as my predecessors did."
Under the old law the Sheriff's office
collected about $20,000 a year in fees
while under the new law for the same
service about $7500 would be collected.
A man who yesterday under the new
law paid $3 30 to the Sheriff' j office in fees
in a replevin suit would have last week,
under the schedule of the old law, paid
$7. Similarly, an attachment on rear
estate now costs $2 45 in the Sheriff's office
and about $1 25 in the Recorder's office,
instead of $5 and $2 50 respectively as such
a process cost under the old system.
A Ship Hauled Over Dry Land.
According to tbe Chicago Chronicle, the
old whaler Progress lias at last been re
moved from her berth on the bottom of
the south pond at Jackson Park. Friday
afternoon the tugs Hausler and Elphicke
towed her to South Chicago. There New
ton Brothers will refit the craft ana put
her in good shape again. Then she will
be taken to New York to serve as a train
ing ship for merchant seamen. Tbe en
trance to the south pond was so filled with
drifting sand that the old bark had to be
hauled over the tongue of land that di
vides the pond from the lake. She rested
on her side on the bottom in shallow
water. Rollers were put under her and a
long hawser was passed over the land to
the tugs stationed in the lake. The old
ship was then hauled bodily across the
land into the lake.
In a pack of cards there are 635,013,559,
--600 different whist hands.

Don't lose sight of the fact that you should
make tricks in your partner's hand as well as i
your own.
Don't forget we are all human and liable to
err in wbist as well as in other walks of life.
Don't straighten up in your chair and ask
what is the score when you have a good hand
dealt you.
Don't forget that a whist-player never grum

that grumble.
Don't jump on your partner with both feet
at the end of each deal; you generally make
the mistakes, not he.
Don't tftke your eyes off the table during the

play.
Don't custom yourself in saying: "It mace no

Don't thing that the lead of a singleton is
not good play, oftentimesâ after the original
lead has been made.
Don't imagine you can learn to play whist in
one day. one week, one month, or one year; it
takes several.
Don't discourage your partner if he is a be

We were all beginners once.
Don't look at the bottom or trump card be

Don't touch or turn a card belonging to your
adversary; if you are entitled to see it ask to
have it turned.
Don't play a card If you think your partner
has revoked. Sit like a sphinx until you feel
sure his play was intended.
Don't ask your partner to draw his card ; the
laws don't permit it. You must ask all the
players to "place their cards."
Don't look at your cards after the opening

Keep your eyes on the table.
Don't bring up a daughter in ignorance of

Don't fail to tell your partner how many

whether in trumps or plain suits.
Don't try to make all the tricks in your own

toward the center of the table.
Don't imagine your ability as a whist-player
is ever measured by the amount of steam you

Don't fail in duplicate whist to announce the
number of tricks you take before you touch
your cards after the play of each deaj.
Don't spread out your cards at the end of a
deal and say: "Wasn't I justified in playing
so and so from that hand?"
Don't lay down the two or three last cards in
hand because you think you can win all the
rest. It often costs a trick.
Don't forget that a card led cut of turn must
be taken btck into the hand and is not a "card
liable to b<? called."
Don'task your partner if he hasaeard of thÂ»
suit led if he renounces, should he have one.
Asking the question establishes a revoke.
Don't ever play a card with a peculiar twist

to work here for nothing and depend on
the tips for my support. I have no doubt
that the boss could eret all the barbers he
wanted for nothing in this shop, because it
is right in the hotel district and we
have regulars who tip liberally. Would
I slight a man who didn't tip me? Well,

Tale of the Baby Hip: notamus.
The steamer Calabar, frc^i West Africa,
has brought into Liverpool a baby hippo
potamus. The animal is abort three or
four feet high and four or five feet long,
and is only three months old. It is so
tame that with evident relish it permits
strangers to rub its nose. TUe capture of
the hippopotamus was brought about in
an ingenious manner. It seems that it
was born in the upper reaches of the
Gambia River, We^t" Africa. It is cus
tomary for the male to eat tne young, and
to prevent this the mother usually 3ecretes
her offspring. The present infant was
placed by the mother in a hole dug on the
banks oi the river, being afterward cov
ered by weeds and grass. This operation
was watched by the natives of the village
adjacent, and when the mother went to
the opposite side of the river to feed they
pounced on and secured their youthful
prize. This was done by covering the
baby with a net and securing it with
ropes. They brought their capture with
all possible speed to the village and sold
it to a trader, who was a passenger in the
Calabar. The animal is in good condi
tion, though its hide bears traces oi the
ropes that bound it when first captured
and when its coat was tender. Its quar
ters on the voyage were a large crate, and
its chief food grass and vegetables. â Lon.

The people of this country will always
admire a boy orator and always Jove and
honor a patriot statesman.
In comparison with Eastern weather
Californfa is not a summer resort merely,
but a sanitarium and a paradise.
One of the best results of the political
revival so far has been the number of
Democrats who have repented and been
converted.
About the time the campaign work gets
hot we shall see Silver Dick Bland busy
with his fall plowing and dodging every
stump in sight.
Society girls will never believe that 16 to
1 is a real party question until it is made
to apply to the ratio of beaux to belles on
dancing platforms.
Even if monometallism were a good
thing, it will take a protective tariff to re
vive industry, pay wages and put the
money into circulation.
Democracy cannot evade the responsi
bility of the ruin caused by its tariff legis
lation, nor can it dodge tbe people on that
issue even by crawling into a silver mine.
It is now announced that the use of
bicycles has seriously affected the strnw
hat trade in the East, and before Ion? we
may expect to bear the milliners com
plaining.
The Republican party hardly needs a
campaign of education to teach the people
the way to prosperity, but it does need
organization to bring the voters out and
keep the procession moving.
An Eastern fashion writer says "no
woman of good figure should hide it in
bloomers," and now the world desire 3to
know whether the emphasis of the remark
is on "Lide it" or "bloomers."
The telegraphic reports of the hot
weather in the East hardly did the thing
justice, for the account given of it in the
Chicago Inter Ocean was topped off with
the scare head, "Sol Sizzles Sweat."
The trade review of R. G. Dun & Co.
attributes the dullness of business in the
East last week partly to hot weather and
partly to apprehensions of Bryan's speech,
but fortunately both have now abated.
From the way the old wheel-horses of
Democracy are kicking over the traces it
seems clear that Bryan will have to run
his band-wagon as a horseless carriage and
take chances on bursting the boiler when
the spurt comes.
It is asserted that Tom Watson once
described Bryan as "a walking mouth
that leaks oat buncombe stuff," but now
that the mouth is riding high Mr. Watson
wishes to get in and ride with it, notwith
standing the leak.
It is reported that in writing financial
articles for the Omaha Wot Id- Herald Mr.
Bryan always wrote it "nnantial," thus
showing that in trying to suit everything
to at, he was in the habit of overlooking
what other folks see.
"Billy Mason," the noted stump orator
of Illinois, has countered Bryan's reference
to the "crown of thorns" and the "cross
of gold," by reminding a recent audience
that there would never have been a cruci
fixion if Judas hadn't cot stuck on silver.
In a city where food and fruit of all
kinds are so pie ntiful as in San Francisco
there is not the slightest excuse for toler
ating the sale of adulterated or deleterious
articles. The best food is cheap in our
market and the cheapest should be good.
The Arizona man who launched the
story of a meteor covering two acres of

tention should always be given to the de
tail*.
THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE.
In his address at the St. Louis conven
tion Senator Foraker, after describing the
ruin wrought in every industry by the
Democratic administration, said: "The
people want a good Republican. They
want something more than a wise, patri
otic statesman. They want a man who
embodies in himself not only all of those
essential qualifications, but who in addi
tion, in the highest degree, typifies in ele
mentary character, in regard, in ambition
and in purpose the exact opposite of all
tnat is sienirted and represented by the
free-trade, deficit-making, bond-issuing,
labor-killing Democratic administration.
1 stand here to present to this convention
such a man. His name is William Mc-
Kinley."
Truer words than these were never
spoken in a political assembly. Senator
Foraker stated the exact sentiment of the
American people in saying they desire to
elect to the Presidency some man who in
politics stands for the direct opposite of
what Cleveland stands for. They desire
moreover that he should be a man whose
record is widely and well known, and
every action of whose life attests his firm,
fixed devotion to that great body of Re
publican principles which may be summed
up in the words "patriotism, protection
and prosperity," or those other words,
"America for the Americans." Senator
Foraker was also right in saying McKin
ley is that man. In fact, it hardly needed
the utterance of the name. It was in the
mind of every man in tne convention. It
was everywhere on tbe lips of the people.
The hour had come. The man was al
ready there.
It was in response to the full swelling
cnurus of the popular voice that McKin
ley was nominated at St. Louis amid an
enthusiasm almost without parallel. He
was not merely the logical candidate of
the party but the inevitable candidate of
the time. From the day when he entered
the army at the age of 18 to right for the
freedom of the slave and the life of the
Union down to the time when he stood
forth in the halls of Congress the invinci
ble champion of protection to American
labor every step in his career has been a
step forward and upward to that hign
eminence on which he so worthily stands.
No part of his success lias been due to
accident. He has not Deen at any point
in his lite, in peace or in war, a creature of
circumstance, the favorite of an hour, the
sudden idol of an unreasoning enthusiasm.
He has attained his honors by the ardu
ous service of duty done in tbe double
character of patriot-soldier and patriot
statesman.
The whole people know McKinley now
as his regiment kuew him during the war.
When he was on guard his comrades slept
soundly, for they knew he wouid. never
fail in any duty of his post. So the people
desire to place Mm now on euard over the
welfare of the Nation. They know his
record on protection, on bimetallism, on
reciprocity, on every issue of the day
and on every interest of the country. To
every question that could be put to him
he might well answer, "Search my rec
ord." In him the people have a leader
whom they nave long known, have often
trusted and In whom they have a well
established confidence. He is the people's
choice and there can be no question but
they have chosen well.
THE GOOD OF PROTECTION.
Although the decade from 1880 to 1890
was the most prosperous period of ten
years in the history of this country the in
crease in wealth and commerce from the
assumption of the reins of government by
the Republican party and the application
of a protection policy between 1860
and 1890 was marvelous. In round
numbers the wealth of the people
of the United States in 1860 was
$16,000,000,000 and in 1890 $65,000,000,000.
In 1860 there were 140,400 manufact
uring establishments and 355,500 in 1890,
wÂ»th an increase in the number of opera
tive from 1,300.000 to 4,800,000. The total
wages paid by manufacturing establish
ments in 1860 was $379,000,000 and in 1890
$2,300 000,000. In 1860 there were 30,000
miles of railway and 167.000 in 1890. In
1860 the country produced 60,000,000
pounds of wool and 276,000,000 pounds in
1890. Wheat production in 1860 was
173,000,000 bushels and 469.000.000 busnels
in 1890. In 1860 we raised 838.000,000 bush
els of corn and 2.100,000,000 bushels in
1890. Between 1880 and 1890 we paid
nearly $1,000,000,000 on the public debt.
These figures should convince any rea
sonaole man of the advantages that accrue
from a protective policy. Prior to the
protective tariff of 1861 the country was at
the mercy of foreign markets and wages
of skilled and unskilled labor were based
upon the wage schedules of Europe.
It was an uncommon thing in those days
to see a workingman live in his own house,
and depositors in savings banks from the
working clas3 were few and far between,
but in these days it is no uncommon
thing to see a wage-earnÂ»r have his own
house all paid for and a surplus to his
credit in bank.
The growth of the material wealth of
the people of the United States between
1860 and 1890 was never equaled by the
people of any nation in twice thart num
ber of years. Between 1860 and 1890 more
individuals earned and owned homes of
their own than did the people of all the
other nations of the earth. Between 1860
and 1890 more American workingtnen be
came owners of industrial plants and com
mercial enterprises than have workingmen
in any other nation in its entire history.
More poor men became rich in the United
States between 1860 and IS9O than in all
the previous life of the country. Between
1860 and 1890 Americans invented more
mechanical devices for cheapening the
production of commodities than the whole
world did from its foundation. Between
1860 and 1890 the United States grew from
a small power, comparatively speaking, to
tbe strongest, numerically, and the
wealthiest commercial nation on the earth,
and the sole and direct cause of it all was
a protective tariff that made it possible
for our people to develop the resources of
their own country.
THE PROGRAMME CHANGED.
When the show started East it was for
mally announced that after the notifica
tion meeting Mr. Bryan would speak in
Baltimore and Philadelphia, and then,
after spending a week or so with Mr.
Sewall at his home in Bath, he would
speak at several points in New England
and in New York and Pennsylvania, after
which . swing westward would be made,
touching at all the principal industrial
stations. In changing the programme so
as to hurry Mr. Bryan to the West and
South his managers virtually abandon all
the State's east of Indiana to Major Mc-
Kinley. As a strictly political proposition
thai was the wisest thing for the cam
paign committee to do. Mr. Bryan failed
utterly to stampede the people at Madi
son-square Garden as he did in the Chi
cago convention. He was not even a
twenty-four hours' wonder.
In New England his party is crying for
campaign money more than they are cry
ing for Bryan speeches. There is abso

\
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
where in the East, and the Democrats
who in former campaigns opened their
pocketbooks to the party are now con
tributing money to defeat the Chicago
ticket. Sewall had planned for a series of
Bryan meetings in his own and adjoining
States, but the wiser heads of the party
see that if Bryan wins at all his victory
must be sought in the West and South,
where the Populist vote is large.
Chairman Jones of the National Com
mittee and Senator Gorman are exper
ienced politicians, and when they saw
how flat Bryan's Hew York speech fell,
and when their own party iv the East re
fused to contribute campaign money, very
naturally they concluded to move the
storm center of the struggle over the re
gions that are tributary to the Mississippi
River and to the Pacific Coast. The
uountain silver States they assume will
go for Bryan in any event, but most likely
events later on will prove that the wish
was father to the thought.
In abandoning the great industrial
States to Major McKinley, Mr. Bryan
admits tbe weakness of his came among
wane-earners, and in fields where capital is
in joint employment with labor in trans
forming raw material into merchantable
products. Necessarily this drives him to
the agricultural regions of the South and
Middle West and the silver-producing
States, but when farmers come to under
stand that he is far free wooi ; opposed to
a sugar bounty; opposed to keeping out
of our markets the pauper labor-raised
cereals and provisions of South America
and Russia; opposed to the maintenance
of home markets by National legislation,
and opposed to a monetary system that
does not contemplate silver monometal
lismâwhen the farmers of the great agri
cultural and stock-raising regions of the
West and South come to understand Mr.
Bryan's position on these important eco
nomic questions, we say, are they not
likely to turn their backs upon him as the
wage-earners and the promoters of busi
ness enterprises in the East already have?
Undoubtedly they will.
PRINCIPLES, NOT MEN.
It is not because Senators Jones and
Stewart and other Republican supporters
of Bryan were as vehement in their advo
cacy of the single gold staudard a few
years ago as they are now for silver mono
metallism, nor because they have swung
from conservative Republicanism to ultra
Populism, back and forth, that discredits
their advice upon economic questions, but
because they are vacillating in opinion
when there is no change in conditions to
warrant any departure from the prevail
ing principles of their old party.
It is not a question of their honesty, but
it is a question of taking advice from men
who have proven themselves to have no
settled and well-defined opinions. Sena
tors Jones and Stewart appear to feel that
their former connection with the Repub
lican party coniers upon them the right to
tell their old party associates, as if by
authority, that they â hould follow
them in their meandering through
the several fields of political weeds
and briars, but* they mistake the
temper of their old following. Their own
right to abandon the party that has hon
ored them so often and so highly is not
questioned if it is a matter of conscience
with them, but they presume when they
say that they alone are ruht and the
millions of Republican voters are all
wrong.
These gentlemen are remembered in
kindness for the noble and heroic deeds
they performed in otner years for the
Republican party, and it is deeply re
gretted that they have abandoned tbe
true and tried principles they used to be
so fond of advocating for political heresies
and economic fallacies; but no loyal Re
publican will follow them into the
enemy's camp; besides, who will stand
their security for adhesion to their new
found political cause or guarantee that
they will not discover another politi
cal ignis fatuus and run off after it before
the campaign is over. To be a leader of
men one must show that he has stable
and deep-rooted convictions and that his
enthusiasm is the outgrowth of honesty of
purpose.
There are religionists who are happy in
proportion to the number of different de-
nominations they have been actively
identified with as full-fledged members, but
while such people are always welcome to
membership they are not listened to in
confidence when they ask old members to
follow them to some new sect tnat has
sprung up. Senators Jones and Stewart
were good and faithful members of the
Republican party at one time, but that
is no reason why they should expect their
former companions to go with them after
strange and dangerous political gods. If
Senators Jones and Stewart prefer the
tents of political wickedness let them dwell
therein, but they may be assured that the
rank and file of the party they once
served will remain in their old home
whose foundation was laid in patriotism,
protection and prosperity by the immor
tal Abraham Lincoln.
A QUEER MONETAEY SYSTEM.
The Democratic and Populist platforms
demand that the national bank system be
abolished and the Government issue all
paper money direct from the treasury.
On the tarifv question the demand is for
duties for the purpose of revenue to meet
the requirements of the expense account
of the Government and no more. When
these two declarations are brought to
gether they reveal a degree of ignorance
in their author that one would hardly ex
pect in a country where a schoolhouse
may be found at every crossing of roads.
If, however, they were formulated ex
pressly to deceive, the author is a com
bination of knave and fool, which makes
the demands more inexcusable than if
they came from a plain, everyday fool.
If the Government issues all the money
and the customs and excise duties supply
enough funds to maintain the Govern
ment, will the Popocrats explain how the
treasury would proceed to get its money
issues in circulation? No doubt they will
say the Government should undertake ex
tensive internal improvements and get its
currency issues in circulation by the labor
payroll route. Very well, that would do
for a while; but the time would come
when there would be no more improve
ments to make. What then?
The declaration is that these paper
money issues shall be redeemable in coin;
but where is the coin to come from to
redeem such a volume of notes as is con
templated? Of course, a very wide out
flow channel would be dug if the plan to
put the railway and telegraph lines under
Government ownership is carried out, for
that would require a lump issue of over
$11,000,000,000 of paper moneyâ about $160
per capita in addition to the $23 we now
have; but it would still be redeemable in
coin, and there is not enough availalbe
gold and silver in the world to redeem
such a quantity. To this the Popocrat
says: "But the notes are receivable for all
debts, public and private." Well, then if
their acceptance is compulsory what is the
sense of having them redeemable in any
thing?
As an Arkansas greenbaefcer said: "If a
greenback ia a legal tender it is so by the
fiat of the Government, and, therefore,
needs no other kind of money bacK of it to
redeem it m." That is exactly what the
I'upocrats mean, and they do not mean
that redemption in coin should be pro
vided for at all.
But, as we have said, if the Government
issues all the money and receives enough
from duties to "run it," how is it going to
get its note issues in circulation? Per
haps the better way would be to pension
every man, woman and child. That
would furnish an avenue for note distri
bution, but where is tha coin to come
from in case a pensioner wants to ex
change his paper dollars for metal dol
larts?
To the great and profound students of
political economy such a question as this
would be considered as unanswerable, but
to the Bryanites it is as easy as rolling off
a log. They would say: "Just declare
there Is no difference between the value
of a paper dollar note that cost less than
a tenth of a mill, a silver dollar that cost
50 cents and a gold dollar that cost 100
cents, and there will be no difference."
JAPAN AND FREE TRADE.
A concluding study of the Japanese
question in the local columns of The Call
to-day confirms the belief tiiat a wise pro
tective tariff is the only remedy against
industrial depressions. Already the Japa
nese have shown themselves proficient
artisans.
Those who say that the Japanese poods
will all be consumed in the Orient have
sadly overlooked the fact that this country
affords better prices, and the other -cardi
nal principle that a people of frugal habits
and low consumptive power never buy. the
finer wares.
Japan will reach out for the American
market, as she is now doing, because we
are a buying Nation. Her manufacturers
have studied our tastes and the}' propose
to make nooda for our markets.
The free-trade policy of the Democrats
offers no check for these evils. There is
no escape from the conclusion that a pro
tective tariff is the only method known to
statesmen by which theevifsof an. inunda
tion of cheap goods from the Orient can be
averted.

THE FARMER'S DANGER.
New York Press.
The American farmer faces to-day the gravest
situation of his history. Heretofore his home
market, at least, save in certain Canadian
staples, which the Wilson tariff has admitted,
save in that butcherly sacrifice of sheep which
that law has also commanded, has been his
own. Formerly the foreign market was also in
great part his own. We give him, through the
clear presentation of one who overlooks the
whole field from its very center, the causes of
his loss of that foreign market which cannot
be regained. As day foilowÃ night those
causes will operate to the loss of bis home
market, unless he takes prompt steps both to
establish and enlarge it The steps are made
easy for his feet. They lead merely to the
polls, where he may cast his vote for the man
whose name is a synonym for American pro
tection In every country of this globe.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Colonel C. W. Tozer, the California pioneer
of 1850, who is known from one cud of the
Pacific Coast to the other, came down from
Nevada County last night and is at the Grand.
He is engaged in many mining enterprises,
but is not rushing work particularly on any of
his claims just now. One of his properties is
the Gaston Ridge, above Grass Valley,
The colonel spoke of the work now being
done in and aoout Grass Valley and Nevada
City, saying there were probably 4000 or
5000 men engaged directly and indirectly
at it.
"Tile country is reasonably prosperous,"
Colonel C. W. Tozer of Grass Valley, the Farly California Miner
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
said he. "We are getting along fairly. Busi
ness in the towns is being continued about as
usual."
Colonel Tozier is one of the most conspicu
ous Republican in the country. He began vot
ing the ticket early, and has stuck to
it ever since, and as an admirer of sucn
men as Grant and Garfield has probably had
no man to surpass him in California. For
these and other Republican nominees he has
done a vast deal of work.
In bis business as a mine manager he has
often visited London and other European capl
tuls. Seven years ago he predicted in a long
article in the South African, published in Lon
don, the greatness of the Johannesburg mines,
which he had then recently visited.
He is down for a few days on business in
connection with mines. "The resources of
California in a mineral way are enormous,
more extensive by far than most people
dream," said he. "I would like to see the era
of activity once again dawn on the State. It
ought to, if there is anything in having moun
tains that are seamed with mineral."
Colonel Tozer arrived here in the ship An
drews, via the isthmus, in March, 1850. He
has an enormous acquaintance on the coast.

A LOUNGING OR BATH ROBE.
White eider down was the material used In
making this useful and graceful gown. It was
lined throughout with pale blue China silk
(the hood being lined with the same) and had
a blue silk girdle, with cords to match, hold-
Ing the fullness of the sleeves In place.
White flannel or serge makes a most sensible
garment, as it may easily be laundered at
home. A binding of pale yellow washable rib-
bon can be used on all the edges, and not de
tract from its economy, for this so-called
washable ribbon really washes, and does awar
with the expense of sending these garments to
the cleaners.
A blue eider down simply bound with white
ribbon is dainty. The hood is lined with white
China si.k, which also washes well.
A gown of pink, blue and tan-striped flannel
had bindings of blue, with blue hood lining
and girdle. A dream In pink wax of roll flan
nel, with silk bindings, girdle and lining all
in the same shade.
White flannel with a lining of primrose yel
low China silk is a combination that is artistic
and can also be washed with good results.
Bright red eider-down makes a very service
able gown, which does not soil so readily as
the more delicate colors, but is still pretty.
Satin ribbon of the same shade, an inch wide,
is used to bind the edges. A girdle of the same
shade of satin ribbon three inches wide is
chosen instead of *ilk cord.
The cheaper outing -flannels make very nse

BRYANâ WOOL.
Arcata Union.
What little there was left in the wool busi
ness in this country since free wool was forced
upon us by the Democratic party has been
wiped out by the nomination oi Bryan and
the inauguration of a free-wool and free-silver
campaign. From all parts of the country the
news comes that the bottom is out, and pro
ducers are being notified that there is abso
lutely no wool market. Among others who
have received such discouraging letters our
Llscom Hill farmer, L. Ford, has received the
San Fbancisco, Joly 23, 1896.
L. Ford, Arcata, Calâ Dkab Mb: The North

the advent of the St. Louis con ventionâ and every
thing looks blue for wool and wool matters, in
fact for all branches of trade for the time being.
We have examined your wool and find it nice,
as usual, and only regret that we are not enabled
to place It at once at a satisfactory price, but as we

ABOUT OPENING LETTERS.
London Graphic.
Perhaps it Is a little bit late to make the dis
covery, but I find from time immemorial we
have been directing ail our letters on the
wrong side. The direction ought to be on the
back instead of what is now called the front of
the envelope. There would be much fewer
mistakes about opening letters belonging to
others if this were the case â in fact, it would
be well-nigh impossible for it to occur. People
with a large amount of ;spoudence fre
quently put all their letters face downward
an a then proceed to snip the envelopes; then
they go through them again and take the
letters out, and sometimes find they have
snipped an envelope belonging to some one
else. All this might be avoided it we wrote
the address on tne side the envelope is fas
tened. It would also have another advan taste,
the s'.amp would be absolutely canceled by
being torn across when the letter was opened
This would effectually put an end to the nefari
ous machinations of those people who are
said to be able to remove the official oblitera
tion in order that the stamps may be used
again. 1 do not suppose my suggestion will
Immediately change the uses of a century, but

PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS FROM
FRENCH HISTORY. By Baron Ferdinand
Rothschild. For sale by Doxey. Palace Hotel:
price f 3 25.
There are people to whom history is the rec
ord of tne evolution of a race and the develop
ment of a nation, and there are others to whom
it is the chronicle of the words and doings of
great men. The former conception clothes
history with the greater dignity, but the latter
makes it the more interesting. For one person
who cares to trace the slow degrees by which
the people of the United States were trans
formed from the conditions of 1776 to those
of 1896 there are a hundred who delight in
every anecdote of Washington, Franklin, Jack
son, Lincoln, and even of such second-rate fa
vorites as Davy Crockett and Sam Houston.
Anecdotical history is In fact one of the de
partments of literature that is most univer
sally pleasing to the great mass of men
and women, and in this respect Is
perhaps second only to the bright
domains of poetry and romance. It may be
safely asserted, therefore, that cne of the most
popular of new books of the season will be the
recently published work of Baton Ferdinand
Rothschild, M.P., "Personal .Characteristics
from Freuch History," illustrated with nu
merous portraits of the noted men and women
whose sayings and doings are recorded in the
book.
The aim of the author has been not to write
a history of France, nor even to give a series
of biographies of famous personages, but
simply to record some of their more important
words of wit or wisdom in order that the
â¢reader may obtain therefrom an idea of the
salient characteristics of the men and women
whose personal influence had much to do in
making the history of France and shaping the
destinies of its people. Enough of history and
biography is given to save the work from be
ing a mere catalogue of famous people or a
book of anecdotes. The historical passages
serve to give a continuity to tne work and
make a good setting lor the stories which con
stitute its chief charm and value.
One of the first anecdotes of the book is of
Philippe II who, on the morning of the battle
of Bouvines, ordered mass to be said before
his whole army, and placing his crown on the
altar said to liis generals: '-Here is mp crown ;
if one of you deems himself worthier than I
to reign over these good people let hiit take it.
If not let us march on the enemy." Ihe King
fought in the battle like an ordinary knight
and won a victory over the Emperor of Ger
many which made mm the foremost irince of
his time. Another of the brave Kings of the
early days was Louis IX, who, when an assas
sin rushed into his tent with a drawn sword
and cried, "Make me a knight or die," calmly
replied, "Become a Christian and I Â»-ill make
thee a knight." The man was awed md fled.
Philippe VI is given the credit of being the
author ot the famous phrase, "Who byes me
follows me,' which has been ever since a
household word in France. Jean Ii having
been taken prisoner at Poictiers regiined his
liberty after some years on condition of send
ing his son as a hostage to England. The
young Prince, however, escaped, and the King
then returned to captivity, saying: 'If good
faith be banished from earth it mat find a
home in the hearts of Kings." It is asserted,
however, by some skeptics that the return of
the King to England was due less tÂ» a noble
love of good faith and honor than tc a desire
to meet, again a fair dame whom heiad met
and admired during his captivity.
Of Louis XII a really noble sayinf is naT
rated. Before he came to the throne aid while
his accession was uncertain he bore the title
of Due d'Orleans, and was at that tine griev
ously injured by the Sire de la TremOTllle. On
becoming King he was advised by his Â©urtiers
to revenge himself on his enemy, butrefused
to do so, saying: "It would be neithel decent
nor honorable for a King of France toavenge
an injury done to the DuKe of Orleans."
Oi Heury IV a multitude of anecdotes sur
vive, but although he was one of tie most
heroic of the Kings of France few reallt great
sayings are recorded of him. One of tty best
was his remark to Pierre Mathleu, whom he
had employed to write his biography: "The
whole truth must be told ; were my deicts to
be ignored other things would not be bejeved;
write them down so that I may avoid Mem in
future." Two of the best known sayings at
tributed to Henry: "Paris is well with a
mass," and "I wish every French peapnt to
have a fowl in the pot," are regarded byÃaron
Rothschild as apocryphal.
After Henry IV the next King of Frajce in
whom the world takes much interet was
Louis XIV. This monarch, whose coirt was
the most brilliant the world has seep, was
himself not noted in conversation eitjer for
wit or wisdom. One of his reparteeslis in
teresting because it shows for how longa time
a phrase still popular has been current in the
world. A certain young courtier said.ln tne
presence of the King, of an old siatesmai that
quite a large book could be written on sibjects
of which the statesman was ignorant. 'And a
very small one," said the Kine, quickly, ]
"couid be written on those of whict you I
know anything." It is related that whÂ£ still
a young man Louis appeared before his >arlia

ment in hunting dress, and when the Presi
dent began to hurangue him on the interests
of the State he interrupted with the exclama
tion, "I am the State!" This is his most
famous saying, the next in rank being the
declaration made at the time of the departure
of the Duke of Anjou to be King of Spain,
"There are no longer any Pyrenees!" The
kindest speech recorded from him was that
made to the veteran Marechal de Villeroy on
the occasion when he brought to the King the
news of the defeat at Ramillies: "At our age,
Marechal, fortune no longer favors us."
The generals and the ministers of Louis
were much better at repartee than the King
himself. Some one having told the Due de
Luxembourg that William 111 of England had
been heard to exclaim, "Shall I never beat this
cursed hunchback?" replied, "Huncnback,
says he ? What does he know of it. He never
saw my back." Marechal Turenne, who was
noted for his careless dress and unfailing good
humor, was walking once through a dark pas
sage when a servant taking him for another
servant, hit him a hard slap on the back.
Turenne turned round and the man recogniz
ing the Marechal, cried out "Monseigneur, I
though you were George." To which lurenne
replied with a laugh: "Even had I been
George, you need not have hit so hard." Of
Colbert, the aDlest Minister of Louis XIV, there
is told a story very similar that told of Wolsey
in English history. On his death bed there
was brought to him a missive from the King.
Without opening it he said to the messenger:
"Let me die in peace. It is to the king of
kings I now have to answer. Had I done for
God what I have done for that man I snould
have found salvation ten times over, and now
1 know not what will become of me. "
Louis XV is regarded by Baron Rothschild
as one of the worst rulers and worst men men
tioned in history. It is said of him, "He lived
like a satrap and died like a coward.'* Not a
single thing said by him has been found worth
repeating, evsn by his couniers. His reign
was made illustrious in history by the exceed
ing brilliancy of his court, which shone by
the very excess of its voluptuous corruption.
It was a period marked by the supremacy
of such women as M me. de Pompadour and
line, de Barri. There was no longer a sense
of honor of any kind, hardly even that of per
sonal courage among the nobles. On one oc
casion a younc; officer of the Royal Guard
went to the Due de Richelieu with the com
plaint that a brother officer bad spat in his
lace. "Fie," replied the Due; "go and wash
it." Monetary honesty was almost unknown
among the courtiers, even in regard to their
debts to one another, and rich men had power
everywhere. The King once sent to the mil
lionaire, Samuel Bernard, to ask the loan of a
few million francs, but Bernard sent back
word: "When one wishes a favor, the least he
can do is to ask for it in person." The "grand
monarque" had so little real pride that he
made the application In person and received
the money. One day the Marquis de Faviere
called on Bernard and said: "I am going to
astonish you greatly. I am not acquainted
with you, and yet lam going to ask you to
lend me 500 louis." To this Bernard replied:
"I shall astonish you more than you have as
tonished me. lam acquainted with you, and
yet I shall lend you the money."
Louis XVI, whose sad destiny it was to pay
with his head for the faults oi others, was in
many respects a really good, warm-hearted
man who sincerely loved his people, but who
did not understand them and had not the
strength of character to govern them. Once
when hunting he met a peasant, of whom he
inquired why he was not making hay.
"Sire," replied the rustic, "the keepers have
forbidden haymaking before the autumn to
save the partridges." "And I," replied the
King, "order you to make the hay at once if
you wish it. It is not right you should lose
your hay to save my game." When in 1789
some deputies from the provinces received an
audience with the King and knelt as was the
custom, Louis raised them up saying, "Rise,
I am your father; the place oi my children is
not at my feet." This kindness of heart, how
ever, did not make up for the lack of brains,
and he precipitated the revolution by the very
means he took to avoid it. He seems, 'iow
ever, to have had a premonition of what was
coming. He said to Lafayette: "I knew a
young man who, having visited a country
where liberty, equality and fraternity reigned,
imagined he could establish the same condi
tion of things in his own land. Do you know
what happened to him?" "No, sire," an
swered Lafayette. "He was hanged," replied
the King. Lafayette was not hanged, but he
made a narrow escape from the guillotine and
passed five years of his life in imprisonment.
The book ends with the Revolution and
many characteristic anecdotes are told of the
leaders of the various factions of those stormy
times. Enough has been written, however, to
show the general nature of the work. It is a
volume which one can open at any page and
read with interest. It gives elimpses of the
men and women who have made the history at
France, and while hardly deserving to be
called history, will do much to enable the
general reader to understand the characteris^

THE SOUL'S FUTURE EDEN.
A STORY OF THE HEAVENLY CAMPFIKES.
By One With a New Same. New"*ork: Harper
<fe Bros. For sale by A. M. Robertson, 126 I'ost
street; price tl 25
Almost since time immemorial philosophers
and students have devoted much thought to
speculation regarding the future world. The
possibilities and probabilities of the unknown
seem to have attracted their attention and to
have held it as did no other subject. From the
day of Gamaliel and his contemporaries to the
present it has been the subjct of discussion. It
would appear that even in this day, when ag
nostic opinions are advanced and are deemed
worthy of credence in certain directions, the
matter of "the world to come" has lost none
of its power to attract thought.
These observations we consider timely in
â view of the publication by Messrs. Harper &
Bros, of "A Story of the Heavenly Campflres."
This is a religious speculation concerning the
existence of heaven. In its general plan of
action it reminds us of Marion Crawford's
"With the Immortals." The speaking charac
ters are chosen from the well-known names of
history, such as Dante, Milton, Cromwell. Kiue
Alfred of England, Gustavus Adolphus of
| Sweden, and Bunyan. The spirits of these
men gather around the "heavenly campfircs"
and discuss the religious, moral and ethical
questions that interested them during their
existence on this earth.
The author might have used more discretion
in choosing the men who are to discuss the
matters put forward. It is difficult to see, for
instance, why he should put into the mouth of
William of Orange words of wisdom on war.

ONE OF THE BEST OF ITS KIND.
THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN. By Sir Walter
JW'Sani New York ana London, Frederick A.
stoKt's Company. For sale by Doxey "Palace
Hotel; price $1 50.
The Master Crafisman is a fairy tale brought
within the limits not only of human possi
bility, but of the possibilities of the London of
our time. In writing it Sir Walter Besant has
made a charming story in which the.course of
true love runs smoothly, ambition moves un
fretted on its way, all the characters mutually
favor and aid one another and the only per
plexing problem in their lives is happily
solved by tbe discovery of a long-lost treasure
whose existence throws over the whole story
something of glamour of genuine romance.
The prologue tells of a certain old sailor,
John Burnikel, reputed to be the possessor of
marvelous wealth. Not even his'cronies know
the origin or the extent of his fortune, and the
tales he tells concerning it are too evidently
lies to receive credit from any one. He has
two nephews, boat-builders, to whom he re
veals the fact that he owns a bagful of gems,
the gift, as he says, of an Indian nabob. On
his death the nephews search the home for
the gems, but cannot find them, and each sus
pects the other of having stolen them. The
result is a quarrel, and they separate. The
one remains in Wapping to carry on the boat
building trade and the other goes to West
London and establishes himself in business
there.
The Wapping branch of the family continued
at the trade of boat-building for three genera
tions while the other branch rose in wealth
and power anrt acqui red a title. The story con
cerns the fortunes of a son of the boat-build
ing branch, who becomes ambitious to enter
Parliament, and a son of the ennobled branch,
who finds himself reduced to poverty and has
no talent of any kind except a certain skill in '
the handling of mechanical tools. Tnere are
two women in the book, one an ambitious lady
of rank who is iv love with the young lord,
and the' other a modest, humble girl, who is
betrothed to the ambitious boat-builder. The
story narrates the way in which the lord shifts
himself into the boat-builder's trade and mar
ries the humble girl, while the toat-builder
gains entrance to Parliament, achieves emi
nence there, and by the discovery of the lost
gems acquires wealth and marries the aristo
cratic dame.
A story of this kind challenges no criticism
as a picture of real life. It is merely a pleas
ant tale for amusement, and is one of the best
of its kind that has been published in a long
time.
THE STUDY STARS.
THE PITH OF ASTRONOMY. By Samuel G.
Bayne of New YorK. Harper & Bros. For sale
by A. M. Kobertson; price $1.
The lay reader of books on astronomy is us
ually confused and discouraged by the vast
mass of figures, Greek letters, signs and the
copious use of Latin names; but the greatest
stumbling block is abstruse mathematical cal
culations which the average reader does not
understand and does not care to investigate.
These objections have mused many readers,
who would otherwise take a deep interest in
this delightful and absorbing science, to aban
don it with the feeling that they could not un
derstand any of its principles or master its
simplest details.
The object of this little book is to put the
main astronomical figures and facts in the
most simple and direct way, so that they may
be easily grasped and remembered by a be-
I glnner, and so that one who has some knowl-

Oh, inexpressible as sweet,

But hadst thou hearing In thy heart
To know what beats in mine,
Then shoulds'. Thou walk, where'er thou art,
In melodies divine.
So warbling birds lift higher notes
Than to our ear* belong :
The mnsic fills their throbbing throats,
But silence steais the none.

And I listened, and somehow the spirit of gloom
That had maddened my soul passeu away-
Passed away, and there rose, like a Illy In

Of the day when all mankind, eternally young.

edge of astronomy can refresh his memory
and find what he needs in a moment, without
searching voluminous works on the subject.
The facts are drawn from the latest ob
servations, calculations and discoveries made
through the use of our large modern tele
scopes, thus bringing all the information up
to date. Facts are given in as few words as
can be used in clearly stating them. Figures
are mentioned in round numbers, so that they
can be easily remembered and understood.
Latin, Greek and signs are left for those who
propose to go into comprehensive details
necessary for a full study of the subject. In
fact, the average reader is here furnished with
a fair knowledge of astronomy, so that he can,
without much trouble, understand its first
principles and be able to converse on this
popular topic with intelligence, and to put
himself on the way, if he so desires, to become
proficient in the science. These conditions
have never been covered by any previously
written book. The chapters on the sun, moon,
earth, fixed stars and constellations are the
most interesting and instructive.
NOT UP TO _HIS STANDARD.
MaGOIE : A GIRL OF THE BTREETSâ By
Stephen Crane; published by L>. Appleton & Co.,
New York; for sale by William Doxey; 160
pages; 76 cents.
The author of "The Red Bndge of Courage"
has not increased his literary reputation by
the little volume entitled "Maggie: A Girl of
the Streets." In behalf of this book it is
claimed that it is "A real and strenuous tale of
New York life." This cannot be doubted, yet
the records of metropolitan police courts
would yield materials for hundreds of such
volumes every year, but with no good result
except to furnish material for the students of
sociology. Such students, with good judg
ment, prefer to take their observations at first
hand; but thus far have not been able to sup
ply any practicable solution of the vital prob
lem.
The story is strongly told and is so true to
nature that there is not a gleam of light to re
lieve the grewsome shadows that encompass
the children of the alleys and rookeries that
so often disgrace modern civilization in the
larger cities of our land.
HOW TO DEVELOP ARID REGIONS
IRRIGATION FARMING.â A handbook for the
practical application of water in the productioa
of crops. By Li.te Wllcox. New York: Orange
Judd Company, publishers. Cloth. Price 9 2.
The author of this work is a practical man
who has spent the greater portion of his life
in irrigation wort and is a recognized author
ity on the subject of irrigation irom a prac
tical standpoint. The manual at hand con
tains twenty chapters and ninety-five
illustrations. The text is clear and concise
and there is not a line of useless verbiage. It
is in fact a marvel of completeness and treats
upon agriculture by irrigation, supplemented
with scientific investigation. The book is
primarily written for and adapted to Western
farmers and farms. The concluding portions
of the book give an admirable review of the
common law of irrigation and a glossary of
irrigation terms. The other chapters, each
based on experience, practice and science, are
on the following topics: Advantages of irri
gation, relation of soils to irrigation, treat
ment of alkali, water suppiy, canal construc
tion, reservoirs and ponds, pipes for irrigation
purposes, flumes and their structure, duty and
measurement of water, methods of applying
water, irrigation of the garden, Irrigation for
the orchard, the vineyard and small fruits, all
about alfalfa, windmills and pumps, devices,
appliances and contrivances, subirrigation
and subsoiling. In paper, presswork and
binding it is an admirable specimen of the art
preservative. It is profusely, handsomely and
practically illustrated.

tale is a strange one end is marked by all the
mysticism characteristic of the author.
A SUPERB EDITION.
THE TEMPLE SHAKESPEARE. MACBETH
ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA. Published by
Macmilian <Â£ Co., New York. For sale by Wil
liam Doxey; price 45 cents.
The two latest of Shakespeare's works issued
in this edition â "Macbeth" and "Antony and
Cleopatra" â have just reached us. We took
occasion in a recent issue to comment on the
tasty character of these little books. They are
real gems of typography, and each one con
tains a dainty etching of one of Shakespeare's
characters, introduced as a frontispiece.
Messrs. Macmillan are to be congratulated on
having put forth the immortal bard's works in
a form handy for the pocket, and at the game
time worthy to find a place upon the shelves
of any library. The prefatory and supple
mentary notes by Israel Gollancz afford con
siderable assistance to the student and are not
the least valuable portions of the edition.
LITERARY NOTES.
Admondo de Amicis' "Constantinople" has
been translated from the Italian by Caroline
Tipton and will be published shortly by
Messrs. Putnam.
Austin Dobson is now correcting the proofs
of his third series of "Eighteenth Century
Vignettes." The volume will not, however,
be published for some time yet.
Sir Walter Besant' s novel, "The City of
Refuge," which is now appearing serially in
the Pall Mall Magazine, will be published in
volume form in the autumn by Messrs. Chatto
of London.
M. Paul Bourget has gone to Ireland, where
he intends making a stay of some duration,
and whence he hopes to return to Paris with
his forthcoming novel in a fair way toward
completion.
Charles Dickens the younger died in Lon
don on July 21 from paralysis. His last work
was a new, uniform edition of his father's
novels, now in course of publication by the
Macmillan Company.
A sea story of American war times is being
published by Messrs. Putnam, under the title
"Will o' the Wasp." The author is Robert
Cameron Roagers, who has already written a
novel, "The Wind In the Clearing."
F. Tennyson Neely has just brought out
under separate covers "McKinley and Hobart,"
by Byron Andrews, and "Gold or Bilver?" by
M. A. Miller. The latter Is a volume in de
fense of sound money. Campaign literature
was never more abundant.
In the Philistine for August the best article
perhaps is "An Hour With Maecenas," showing
the futility of mixing tuppence worth of lit
erature with an intolerable deal of finance. A
prose poem by Ouida is a very choice bit of
composition. "Let There Be Gall Enough in
Thy Ink," by Adeline Kuapp, is not a plea for
more gall, but a protest against any.
Notable features of Outing.for August are:
"A Bout With the Bluefish,"by Ed W.Sandys;
"The Half-Raters," by R. B. Burchard: "Two
Handicaps," by Caroline Shelley; "The Naval
Militia," by Lieutenant W. H. Stayton, and
"Piain John Miller," by C. P. Burton. Other
seasonable sketches and many illustrations
complete an excellent number. The editorial
and record departments are very interesting.
Memorials to Matthew Arnold, Cardinal New
man, Thomas Hughes, Cardinal Manning
and a joint one to Heminge and Condell,
Shakespeare's publishers< were unveiled re
cently in London on a single day. Arnold's
bust is in the baptistry of Westminster Abbey
and Newman's statue in Brompton Oratory.
The coincidence of the ceremonies in honor of
these two leaders of rival religious movements
on the same day was entirely due to an acci
dent.
The leading story of The New Bohemian for
August is called "Two in a Garden," and is
from the pen of Leonora Beck. It is a striking
story of the weakness of human nature and
the strength of human love. "Along tho
Dunes at Scheveningen," by Mercia Abbott
Keith, is a well written and handsomely
illustrated article on this famous Dutch
watering place. R. G. Robinson tells, in a
semi-humorous vein, of "The Backsliding of a
Backwoods Christian," and incidentally gives
some clever portrayals of Cracker life and
character in South Florida. There are
numerous other features of exceptional
merit.
The Review ol Reviews for August, while
largely given over to the issues of the Presi
dential campaign, finds space for the treat
ment of other important topics. Besides the
character sketch of Mr. Bryan, the Democratic
candidate for the Presidency, tne Review has
illustrated articles on Harriet Beecher Stowe
and Dr. Barnardo, the father of "Nobody's
Children." There is the usual elaborate re
sume of the curr ent magazines, and the de
partments of "The Progress of the World,"
"Record of Current Events" and "Current
History in Caricature" answer the typical
American demand for what is up to date and
"live."
The Macmillan Company has already pub
lished a considerable number of books bear

ment, etc., and will very shortly add to these
'â¢An Introduction to the History of the Church
of England From the Earliest Times to the
Present Day," by Henry O. VVakeman, author
of a volume in the "Periods of European
History Series" on "Period V: The Ascend
ency of France, A. D. 1598â 1715." The book
is not a manual or textbook, but is rather an
answer, in a short and convenient form, to the
question, "How is it that the Church of Eng
land has come to be what it is ?"
The ninth edition (just issued) of Copp's
Mining Code, published by Henry N. Copp, a
lawyer of Washington, D. C, is at hand. It is
abooK of more than 200 pages and will be
found of great interest to mine-owners
and prospectors, as it gives the United
States mineral land laws and the offi
cial instructions thereunder, the vari
ous State and Territorial mining laws,
miners' liens, rights of way, etc., numerous
forms for use from the location to the patent
ing, lease and sale of a mine, and also a large
collection of abstracts of court and land office
decisions and rulings. The San Francisco
News Company handles Mr. Copp's publica
tions on the Pacific Coast. The book is for sale
by the principal bookstores. Price 50 cents.

Throughout the work the author seeks merely
to give facts, generously leaving the reader to
draw his own conclusions. Care has been
given to indicate the sources of these facts,
many of which come from official publications
of the Government.
Messrs. Harper & Bros, have in press "Liter
ary Landmarks of Venice," by Laurence Hut
ton, which is written for the "foreigners, for
the men of letters, for the lovers of art. It is
the Venice I know in the real life of the pres
ent and in the literature of the past; and to
me it is Venice from its best and most interest
ing side." There are illustrations from draw
ings by F. V. Dv Mond and Guy Rose.
The North American Review for August has
a masterly paper by Sir Walter Besant on "The
Future of the Anglo-Saxon Race," in which he
traces the rise and progress of the Anglo-
Saxon race, points out the characteristics
which have made it so successful, and discusses
the means by which its position of commanding
influence and power in the world may be
maintained and strengthened, in the same
issue the Hon. Robert P. Porter gravely asks
"Is Japanese Competition a Myth?" Mr.
Porter's recent extended tour of Japan
afforded him tho opportunity of observing on
the spot the growth of Japanese industries,
and he arrived at the opinion that Japan will
soon be a formidable competitor of Europe and
America in the markets of the world.
The midsummer fiction number of the Critic
25) opens with an essay on "The Treat
ment of the Plot," by Miss Louise Stockton of
the Round Robin Reading Club, a sister of the
noted story-writer. This is followed by eight
pages reviewing sixty recent novels and col
lections of short stories. There is an account
of the recent dinner of the Omar Khayyam
Club at Marlow on the Thames, with Grant
Allen's vigorous poem written for the occa
sion. The number is illustrated. Volume xxv
of the new series of the Critic (January-June,
1896) has just been issued in the well-Known
maroon-colored cloth covers with gilt stamp.
Like its predecessors, it contains the complete
record of the course of American literature
during the period coveredâ not only the record
of books published and their literary value,
but of movements in letters and of happenings
in all fields of the craft.
Quite a novelty in the newspaper line has
been issued by the managers of the Emporium.
It is a small 12x9 publication entitled The
Twentieth Century, and its reason for being,
as outlined in an introductory, is "to give the
people of the City, the State and the Coast a
clearer and better knowledge of the most beau
tiful store in the world; to tell more than can
be told in advertisements iv the daily papers
of its aim.s, its method of conducting busi
ness, its ability to save its patrons money, and
to give an insight into its plans for the public
welfare, and to give forecasts of the coming
styles." A musical and literary page will be
features of the new publication. It will doubt
less meet with success, judging by its initial
number.
Ada Cambridge has a novel of that title in
Appleton's Town and Country Library. It is
a story where the rich hero looks for true
worth in the life companionship matter, rather
than a brilliant match. The heroine is an
orphan girl, who is winning her own way in
the world. The hero's parents had an idea of
marrying him to a lady of title and making a
great swell of him; but the hero is differently
disposed, believing that "a good wife is above
rubies." The heroine runs a tea-room, and
the enterprise ends up with her rich marriage.
The author explains that she "regards a rich
marriage as a vulgar sort of thing, and
by no means the proper goal of a good girl's
ambitions"; but this particular heroine's
union is considered about the nearest ap
proach to happiness discovered up to date.

Among technical articles covering nearly
every phase of the graphic arts the Inland
Printer for August contains special articles of
much merit. The full text of the oration by
H. D. Estabrook at the unveiling of the
Franklin statue, in Lincoln Park, June 6, 1896,
revised by th 6 author, is given in this issue. A
fully illustrated account of Chicago monu
ments, semi-historical in character, is a feature
that will be appreciated by Chicagoansand the
American public generally. The work of the
students of the Art Institute in the illustration
classes has a large representation among the
reproductions by the half-tone process. An
elaborate cover design by O. Ginannini, in rich
colors, makes the exterior of the magazine
very attractive. Among the articles are:
"Chicago Art Institute Class Work," "Remin

A book for which three Presidential aspir
ants have written an introduction on the verge
of a political contest and which each has com
mended in unqualified terms certainly de
serves notice. Messrs. McKinley, Morton and
Reed have, in their introduction, not merely
expressed their approval of the work as in
thorough accord with their own well-known
views on protection, but they have stated 'heir
belief that it is the ablest, the most exhaustive
and the most accurate treatise on the subject
that has ever been written. This is strong
praise, and coming from such prominent men
challenges the attention of every one who is
in the least interested in the subject.
The commercial history of England is treated
in 350 compactly written pages, comprising
first the early free-trade period, during which
the English depended upon foreigners for
their clothing, implements and all manufac
tured articles, and allowed these foreigners
the monopoly of their wholasale and retail
trade; then the gradual rise of a protective
policy from the small beginnings under Ed
ward 111 through the great industrial epoch of
Elizabeth's reign down to the early part of
this century, when England had driven the
merchant vessels of every Continental nation
from the seas. By 1850 she stood foremost
among all the nations of the world, unques
tionably the greatest commercial power that
had ever existed. During this entire period
protection had been ncr consistent and un
wavering policy. The contrast between it and
the earlier period, when an opposite policy
was followed, is vividly set forth.
Following the tariff question in the United
Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia and other
European countries, a history of the tariff
question in the United States is then taken
up in its order, and all the tariff laws
which have been enacted from 1789 to tho
McKinley bill in 1892 are explained. The de
pression in trade following the low tariffs of,
1837, 1846 and 1857 is shown to have result
ed from an attempt to establish free trade.
Again, the business activity and industrial
growth resulting from the protective tariffs
of 1824, 1828 and 1842 are contrasted with
the opposite results of low duties. The pro
tective-tariff period of 1862 to 1892 is then
taken up in considerable detail, and the
flourishing condition of the country is
described. The causes which made the Mo
Kinley bill a necessity, its various features and
the magnificent results which followed its enÂ«
actment are presented. Chapters are also de
voted to the growth, of agriculture, the cotton,
woolen, iron and steel and various industries
of the country. After tracing the Industrial
development of the Nation through the past
third of a century under protection, a chapter
is devoted to the recent revival of the free
trade movement since 1880, the election oi
Grover Cleveland, passage of the Gorman-
Wilson bill and its effects on tne commercial
ami industrial interests of the country.
The work can be recommended as an
authoritative and exhaustive treatise on pro
tection in all its phases.
AN ASTOR WRITES A BOOK.
A JOURNEY IN OTHER WORLDS. By John
Jacob Astor. New York: D. Appleton & Co.
For sale by William Doxey: price 60c.
The present is an age when rich men appear
to be burning with ambition to shine as liter
ary lights. The average whole-souled pluto
crat, desirous of making himself immortal
with much ease and little expense, generally
essays biography as a means to this end. It is
a simple matter with a good library and an
efficient stenographer to compound something
in tbe nature of a pot-au-feu relating to some
half-forgotten personage, which will revive an
interest in the useful life and beautiful traits
of character of the late lamented.
But John Jacob Astor has scorned this means
of handing himself down to posterity. He has
written what he calls "A Romance of the
Future," dealing with the possibilities, in a
scientific sense, of the year 2000. True, this
field has already been entered by Jules Verne
and Edward Bellamy; but what of thatT
Surely it cannot be said that any one depart
ment of literature can be pre-empted by any
one man. Besides, Mr. Astor furnishes an
original reason for the being of his work. He
remarks in his introductory speech: "There
can be no question that there are many forces
and influences in nature, whose existence wa
as yet little more than suspect." We imagine
we have heard this theory advanced before.
However, he proceeds to describe the actions
of members of a scientific party of men who
have taken upon themselves the contract of
straightening the terrestrial axis. After
skimming over the history of past centuries in
a couple of chapters, Mr. Astor's scientists de
cide to take a trip to Jupiter, using a sort of
projectile as a vehicle. How they fared and
what they did we leave the reader to see for
himself. The book is well printed and illus
trated, and has attained the dignity of a sixth
edition.

LEPROSY REMEDY
Dr. WinsloW /Anderson's Learned,
Valuable and Interesting p^per
on the Dread J^alady
The ancient condition of the Hawaiian
Islanders was like that of the natives of
the South Pacificâ especially those of Poly
nesia â to whose race they belonged.
It is estimated on the beat authority
that the islands were inhabited as early as
600 A. D., and probably much earlier.
From this time, until shipwrecked Span
iards were driven by the trade winds to
the Islands of Hawaii in 1527, no defi
nite kuowlege of the inhabitants has been
obtained. In 1555 the islands were dis
covered by Juan Gaetano, and again by
Captain Cook in 1778. Captain Cook esti
mated that in 1778 there were over 400,000
inhabitants. In 1832 there were only 130,
--000; in 18ti6the population was reduced to
59,000, and in 1896 there are about 32,000
native Hawaiians. The causes operative
in the extermination of this splendid race
are diseases such as consumption and
measles, brought over by the early sailors
and settlers. Oftentimes measles will kill
off half of the inhabitants of a village
when attacked. Intemperance, syphilis
and other vices are responsible for many
deaths. The native medicine men or
"Kahunas" play no small part in Killing
off these simple-minded men-of-the-sea by
their superstitious and barbarous method
of treating the sick. The total mortality
of leprosy since its introduction into the
islands has been only about 5000.
Leprosy appeared on the islands for the
first time in 1844, at which time several
Chiness were found suffering from the
disease. It is therefore known to the Ha
waiians as mat pake, or Chinese disease.
The first case of leprosy among the native
Hawaiians occurred eight years later
(1852). At the present time (1896) there
are about 1200 lepers on ihe islands, ot
whom about 7CO are males and about 500
are females, mostly native Hawaiians and
balf whites. There are a few Chinese,
English, Americans, Germans, Portu
guese, Spanish, South Sea Islanders and
one negro suffering from the disease.
During the twenty-six years following
the time leprosy first made its appearance
on the Hawaiian Islands the disease spread
to an alarming extent; accordingly in
18t>6, during the reien of Kamehameha V,
a leper hospital was established at Kalihi,
Oahu, for the purpose of segregation and
isolation. Later in the same year a leper
colony was founded on the beautiful
island of Molokai. Here on the north
ern slopes, sheltered from the winds, is a
fertile valley comprising some 5000 acres.
This valley is surrounded on the north,
east and west by the ocean and on the
south by impassable precipitous mount
ains, 2000 to 3000 feet in height, formerly
an extinct volcano. In this garden of the
sea, with luxuriant tropical verdure, is
the present site of the Hawaiian leper
colony, where the unfortunate sufferers
are surrounded by all the comforts the
present enlightened Hawaiian Govern
ment, can give them. Here they live and
cue in sunshine and in peace!
Origin of leprosy.
As with many other diseases and social
conditions, it is somewhat difficult to de
tcrmina when and where leprosy origi
nated. It is probable, however, that
leprosy arose in the delta and valley of
the Nile in prehistoric times. Leprosy '
was endemic in Egypt as eariy as 1500 j
B. C, and existed in India, Palestine,
Arabia and China. It was also endemic |
among the Hebrews when they migrated
from Egypt.â Lev. xii.
Leprosy existed in Persia, and the j
earlier Greek and Latin writers speak of j
ihe disease. In Greece and Italy we find
it as early as the first century B. C. The '
disease was probably introduced by the ]
army of Pompey. From there it spread
to the Roman colonies in Spain, Gaul and
Britain. Charlemagne made laws regu- j
lating the marriage of lepers in the seventh
century. In the eleventh century we find |
the disease at, Canterbury. During the i
criifadcs leprosy became epidemic in i
Western Europe. It was estimated that j
at least 19.000 lepers existed in Europe at !
this timeâ lo96 to 1271 A. D.
Hospitals and lazarettos were estab
lished for the care and isolation of lepers
all over infected Europe. Ninety-five
such houses are recorded in England,
.Scotland and Ireland. Bergen, Norway,
established a hospital in 1277, which until
late years had 2000 inmates. Leprosy is J
met with even at ihe present day in many
parts of the civilized world, from the
frozen north of Norway and northern
Russia to the sunny south of India and
the Pacific islands. Within tha last six
months a case was discovered on the
streets of Paris ana sent to the Hospital
ht. Louis, where there were already sev- i
eral other patients. The hospitals in San I
Kenu and in Spain and Portugal are
never without leprous cases. Turkey and
the lonian Islands are also infected. '
Crole alone has over bOO cases. In British !
India it is estimated that there are over!
100,000 cases. In Japan there are 100,000 i
lepers. One hundred thousand cases or !
more will be found in China. The prov
ince of Canton counts over 10,000 lepers.
South America and Africa are infected
with leprosy, so that it is impossible at
present to ascertain the number of per
sons afflicted with the disease. It is I
safe, however, to estimate that no fewer j
than from 300,000 to 350,000 cases of j
leprosy exist at the present time in
various parts of the world. Even San
Francisco has a number of cases on hand
most of the time.
Caubk or leprosy.
Temperature, climate, aoil, race, habits
and food all have been regarded as predis
posing if not ticking causes of the dis
ease.
That temperature has no obvious influ- j
ence on the disease is manifest from the
fact that Jeprosy prevails alike in Norway
and India.
That soil and climate are equally inop
erative is shown by the fact that it occurs
both on marshy soils and at high eleva
tions, both on the seacoast and inland
regions, both on continents and on islands.
Race and habits are not specific causes,
as proven by the existence of the disease }
among persons of the most diverse and
opposite habits. Tne theory that a fish
diet is a cause of leprosy has been dis
proven Dy the fact that the disease ap
pears in many parts â such as the interior
of Spain, for instance, where only the
very wealthy can afford fish.
That leprosy originates from cold and
exposure and a want of vegetable diet ia
also erroneous, beoause the greatest num
ber of cases occur in warm climates, such
as India, where clothing is never needed
and where a vegetable diet alone is used.
The real cause of leprosy is undoubtedly
the leprous bacillus, a Email, rodlike
vegetable micro-organism similar to the
bacillus tuberculosis. The disease is
contracted by inoculation â actual con
tact of the mucous membrane or abraded
parts of the cutaneous system. It is
never hereditary, as is generally sun
posed; but children may, and often
do contract the disease from infected
mothers after birth. The most usual
manner of inoculation in the Hawaiian
Islands 13 found to be their method of
greeting. When two friends or relations,
meet they first rub noses, them embrace
and kiss. During this kissing process
their lips are firmly pressed together and
the tongue is protruded into each other's
mouth. This form of salutation is no
doubt responsible for the spread of the
disease as much if not more than any
other social custom or relation which ex
ists. Another prominent method of prop
asrating the disease in found ia the man
ner the Hawaiians care for those afflicted
with leprosy.
Dr. L. F. Alvarez, in Pacific Medical
Journal, January, 1895, says:
â¢<* â¢ â¢ I found an unfortunate woman
in a dark, low basement. She was
paralyzed, blind, without finsrers or toes
and had open ulcers on her arms and legs.
Her friends fed her by conveying potâ a
native dish not unlike bill-poster's paste â
to her mouth with their fingers, and gave
her water by taking a mouthful of it, fit
ting their lips to the leper's and transfer
ring the water to her mouth. This dis
gusting manner of giving water to the
sick still prevails in many Hawaiian
homes where spoons are unknown. This
leper woman was returned to the hospital
at the leper settlement. Since then nine
teen persons of her family and friends
have developed leprosy, many of whom
httd been nursing this woman."
Leprosy undoubtedly occurs from di
rect contagion â transmission of the bacil
lus of Hansen â from an infected person.
All animals enjoy perfect immunity from
leprosy, occasionally reported cases to the
contrary notwithstanding, as the bacillus
in these so-called leprous animals has
never been demonstrated.
Incubation.
The period it takes for the disease to
show itself after incubation averages about
six to seven years.
Duration.
The disease proves fatal in from ten to
twenty years.
It is not the object of this article to dis
cuss the pathology of leprosy. Suffice it
to say that three well-marked varieties of
the disease exist, viz., tubercular leprosy,
non-tubercular or anesthetic leprosy, and
mixed tubercular and paralytic leprosy.
The tuoercular variety being the most rap
idly fatal, the patient seldom lives more
than from eight to ten years after the dis
ease manifests itself.
Treatment of Leprosy.
In such a chronic and fatal disease as
leprosy it is small wonder that many dif
ferent kinds of remedies have been tried.
Excision of the primary lesion has failed,
as it has in syphilis, because the system
is already infected before the primary le
sion appears. Mercurials and iodide of
potassium are worse than useless. Creo
sote, salol, salicylate of soda, gynocardic
acid, quinine, arsenic, iron, gurjun oil ana
chaulmoogra oil have proven of benefit.
For external use chrysarobinum, iodine,
ichthyo!, iodoform, europhen and pyoleta
nine have proven useful.
The Goto Treatment.
This consists in bathing daily in hot
water in which are placed bags containing
hichiyon bark, taifunshi, sulphur and
yoku yaku. Internally he gives seiket
suren pills, tincture chloride of iron, qui
nine, strychnine, iodide of potash, gentien,
columbo, carbonate of soda and potash,
and Epsom salts.
Goto during his many years of residence
in Hawaii failed to cure a single case.
"The proof is lacking that cure has been
obtained in any case 1 ' (Dr. Emerson.
Government Physician, Hawaii). "Many
of the patients reported Dy Dr. Goto as
almost cured have since died of leprosy."
(Dr. Alvarez). Several Hawaiian lepers
have gone to Japan to be treated at
Go;o's leper hospital in Tokio. But
several years' treatment :n that institu
tion, "in some cases without even
amelioration, convinced these Hawaiians
that it was useless to remain in Japan,
hence they returned home and were sent
to the leper settlement" (Dr. Alvarez,
Bacteriologist, Hawaiian Government).
"Dr. Goto's Japanese treatment has
failed" (Dr. Ashmead). From per
sonal observation in the Hawaiian
Islands I am satisfied that Goto's
so-called treatment is entirely em
pirical, without the slightest scientific
foundation, and, as every educated phy
sician who has ever tried it or seen it tried
confirms, it is absolutely without any
merit in the treatment of leprosy. The
so-called temporary benefit results merely
from the cleanliness obtained by the fre
quent bathing and the tonic treatment,
which could better be established by
scientific medicaments.
More recently (August, 1896) a Dr.
Thomas Holmes of Brooklyn, N. V., de
scribed in the daily press as "an aged
physician, " has discovered a cure (?) for
leprosy. He incloses his patient in a
glass case, into which he also introduces
"certain gaseous vapors, into the composi
tion of which suiphur enters largely.' 1
This vapor is supposed to kill the bacilli.
When it is remembered that before lep
rosy is discoverable there are already de
structive ulcerations of tne tissues or
pathological affections of the nerves the
absurdity of the "cure" is at once manifest.
A possible cure for leprosy exists
in using the antitoxine âan alka
loidal extractâ of the bacillus of leprosy
itself. A year or more ago the present
bacteriologist of the Hawaiian Islands,
Dr. L. F. Alvarez, in discussing the sub
ject with the writer concluded to try the
antitoxine of the leprous bacilli hypo
dermically at the leper station at Kalihi.
This treatment 1 saw carefully and
scientifically applied on the islands dur
ing my recent visit, and if there are any
scientific data for the use of vaccination
as a protective against smallpox, rasteur's
treatment of hydrophobia, Koch's treat
ment oi tuberculosis, Behringand Roux'b
treatment of diphtheria, etc., then cer
tainly leprosy may be benefited and cured
by using the antitoxine of the bacillus it
self. One great obstacle is the separa
tion of the antitoxic from the toxic
elements in the leprous toxines extracted
from the leper bacilli, but this can be over
come by patient investigation, and I do
not despair of finding a scientific remedy
for this dreadful malady.

Banp! ! There was the report of a pistol
yesterday in Belasco's Lyceum of Acting
and a young girl threw up her arms, cast
her eyes heavenward in a spasm of agony
and fell prostrate â on a soft cushion.
Frederick Belasco fired the shot and
Miss La Faill* fell. There was no bnllet
that penetrated the heart of La Faille, but
she fell just the same and lay as though
she were dead. There was nothing at all
unusual about it because Miss La Faille is
shot at three days in the week and falls in
Frederick Bclasco In the Act of Hurling a Fair Pupil to the Floor.
a way that makes the observer's blood
curdle.
Miss La Faille was not the only aspiring
young actress that measured her length
on the cushion yesterday; a half-score of
others followed her. They wero not all
shot at, either. They were seizad by the
hair and hurled down by their stern
teacher.
One of the most important accomplish
ments of an actress is to be able to fall.
They must learn to fall down with a min
iature crash and not yet really injure
themselves. It is a hard thing to learn,
too. "I devote an hour a day," said Miss
Drinkall, "to my falling. I fall on the
hard floor now and it does not hurt me in
the least. But when I began you may be
assured I was covered with black and blue
spots and sore in every muscle."
"There is quite a science attached to the
accomplishment of falling. It looks easy,
the same as swimming does," said an
other future debutante, "but when you
come to actually practice it you find it an
exceedingly difficult matter.
"It requires nerve, too," chimed in an
other coming histrionic heroine, the pos
sessor of a mass of golden curls. "When
your head strikes the floor, unless you
The Fair Pupil Hnrled to the Floor, Lying Prostrate Yet Unharmed.
know how to fall, the sensation is not at all
pleasant."
"We all like to fall though," exclaimed
a third. "It is real fun when you get used
to it."
Mr. Belasco took his position at the end
of the cushion and called to one of his pu
pi!s to go through the ordeal. Suddenly
his genial expression changed to one of
suppressed fury. He grasped the young
lady by the hair and hurled her with
great force to the floor. She fell. The
noise of her falling was distinguishable
above the din of the wagons on the cob
blestones of Market street She lay a
moment with her eyes closed and then got
up, smiled and said:
"It didn't hurt me the least bit."
The young lady, who fell with perfect
grace and abandon, was fortunate, from
the onlooker's stana point, because one or
two falls were considered sufficient by her
teacher, and she was allowed to sit down
and arrange her fallen hair and watch the
others. One of the iron-clad roles of this
particular lesson is that the pupil remove
all the hairpins from his or her hair and
allow the tresses to flow as nature in
tended. But if a novice exhibited the
slightest timidity or lack of faith in the
softness of the floor and strove to lessen
the force of her fall by her arms, she was
placed under the ban, and reauired to go
through the operation at least twenty
times.
"There are several kinds of falls," said
Miss La Faille. "When one's senses reel
from uorrow one falls directly backward,
the shoulders being the first portion of the
body to strike the ground.
"A front fall is when one is reduced to
the depths of despair. Then the fall is
flat on the face, the hands being used to
protect the face.
"When one is shot or stabbed there is
first a reel and a stagcer and then a fall to
the side or partially on the back, as the
case may be. The hands are then at the
side and the eyes are closed.
"Whenever we fall we imagine we are
in the midst of some terrific passionate
scene and fall as naturally as we would on
such an occasion.
"At first it produces headache and
causes nausea to fall and the tendency is
to throw oat the arms to protect yourself,
but with the right kind of practice this all
wears off and it becomes really a pleasur
able sensation.
"The first lessons are always on the
cushion, but this only continues for about
three weeks of daily lessons. After we
aro thrown down on the hard floor and fall
down ourselves on it.
"At home we practice falling down a
flight of stairs, and trip ourselves pur
posely to fall.
"It is not always the heaviest women
who fall the heaviest. It is all art. A
light woman unversed would fall with
great weight. We simply relax every
muscle and fall as though we had no con
trol whatever over our limbs."
Longevity of /\nimals.
Rabbits and guineapigs live 7 years,
squirrels and hares 8, cats about 10, dogs
about 12, foxes 14 to 16, cattle 15 to 18,
bears and wolves 20, rhinoceroses 25, the ass
and the horse 25 to 30, the lion 30 tc 40, the
camel 40. According to Aristotle, Buffon
and Cuvier the elephant lives two
centuries; some authors say even four
or five. After his victory over Porus, Al
exander consecrated to the sun an ele
phant that had fought for the Indian mon
arch and gave it the name of Ajax, and
then, having attached an inscription to it,
he set it at liberty. The animal was found
350 years later. Buffon says the stag's age is
35 or 40 years. Fishes, especially the
large species, are long-lived. Acccording
to Bacon, eels reach 60 years, carp have
been known to live at least 150 years, when
they seemed as lively and agile as ever.
Dolphins, sturgeons and sharks live over
a century and attain a huee size. Pike
have been known to weigh 1000 pounds,
indicating a great age. A pike caught at
Kaisers-Lautern was 19 feet long and
weighed 350 pounds; this was in the year
1497. It bore in its gills a copper bolt
with an inscription stating that it had
been put in the pond by the order of
Frederick 11, that is, 261 years before.
Whale-fishers have exterminated the huge
whales of the polar seas. Those that were
formerly met with were of prodigious
size. It is supposed, with some prob
ability, that they lived several centuries
and that they may even reach the age of
1000 years-
It is not known with any degree of pre
cision how long birds live, except that
their longevity is great. An eagle died at
Vienna at 103. Buffon says the life of the
crow is 108 years, and Hesiod says 1000
years. A paroquet brought to Florence in
1633 by the Princess Provere d'Urbia when
she went there to espouse the Grand Duke
Ferdinand was then 20 years old, and
it lived fully 100 years after. The cele
brated naturalist Willoughby had certain
prcof that a goose lived a century, and it
is conceded that the swan's is longer yet;
some authorities give it two and even three
centuries.
For Feed mci nc a Horse.
An ingenious man has invented a device
for feeding his horse, and he does it with
one of the ordinary alarm clocks. For in
stance, if the horse is to have its morning
feed of grain at 5 o'clock, the alarm is set.
and when the morning comes the horse
gets its breakfast before its owner's eyes
are open. It is so arranged that the alarm
pulls the slide, letting the grain run
through a sluice to a manger.

JILL-DJIY VISITOR WITHOUT
JIjN OBgJECT
Jhe Ten-year-Old Qirl Who Reads
/Iristotle and the "Reflective
Woman" Who,
by Will
In the reading-room of the Public Li
brary may be seen day after day a slight
youne man, with a pale, refined face. His
clothes are neat, but old, and however
well kept they will soon become sbabby.
He comes in every morning at 10 o'clock
and leaves about 5. Sometimes he goes
ont at noon for a few minutes: at other
times he remains during the lunch hour,
and taking a roll frexn his pocket slowly
eats it. He reads one paper after another,
and seems mostly interested in the adver
tisements. He makes a memorandum of
some of them, and for the moment his
face brightens. Then he takes up the
magazines and looks them over with a
listless air. Upon rare occasions some
one recognizes him and he return? the
nod shrinkingly and goes on reading.
One of these chance acquaintances in
speaking of him said :
"Two years ago he bad a prosperous lit
tle business in the country. He failed,
and his wife persuaded him to come to the
city. He would make a good salesman;
he is also a bookkeeper, but he has never
been able to obtain a position. He can
vassed for a while, but his sales were few.
His modest retiring manner was against
him. Once he obtained a position as
brakeman on a streetcar, but the work
made him ill. Now he goes downtown
early every morning, looks for work for
an hour or two and then comes here, where
be remains until night."
"And his wife?"
"Oh, she invested a little money she
had laid by in a tiny shop which she tends.
She also Eews for the factories, and takes
care of the baby."
"Why, pray, doesn't he remain home to
help her?"
"She prefers that he should not. If you
happen to ask for him she says: 'John is
downtown. Poor fellow. He leaves home
at 7 o'clock and walks around all day
looking for work.' Then the brave little
woman sighs, waits on a customer, sews
and soothes the fretful baby. With it all
she is falling behind and before long the
shop must be given up.
"Her husband does not mean to deceive
her, but if he went home after two or
three hours she might scold and say he
did not try. When he comes in at night,
tired and dispirited, she says quite cheer
fully, 'Any news, John;' And when he
answers 'No,' she says: 'Never mind, get
up early to-morrow morning and look
again.'"
Another frequenter of this library is a
consumptive-looking man of middle age.
He comes about 7 in the evening, selects a
book, remains reading it until iO o'clock,
and then lakes it home. The next night
be appears again, takes out another book
and proceeds as on the evening before.
Evidently he sits up half the night to fin
ish it, for he is engaged during the day in
some light occupation that doe? not over
tax his feeble strength. He is a bachelor
and a most Baying man. Books are his
only diveraion. The only pleasure he has
taken in twenty years was his trip to Chi
cago during the exposition. He lives over
and over again the delights ot that visit,
and his conversation is chiefly upon that
subject He tells you between the inter
vals of a hacking cough that in 1900 he in
tends going to Paris, and it is noticeable
that the books he reads are all works of
travel. Not a possibility of his not sur
viving until then ever crosses his mind,
although his frail figure, his halting step,
his weak voice, make one doubt whether
the next night he will be reading in his
accustomed place.
The busiest time at this library is after
school hours. Then come trooping in the
school children, from the tiny tot just be
ginning to read to the boy or girl ready to
leave school. Of course they choose books
according to their age and taste. One iit
tle girl about 10 years old comes regularly
twice a week. From her appearance she
is evidently the child of poor parents, but
she has a bright winsome face, and a
thoughtful air far beyond her years. She
attracts attention by the books she invari
ably selects. They are always works of
philosophy. As she was trudging off with
"Aristotle" the question was put to her :
"Are you going to read this book your
self?"
"Yes," she replied, gravely, C l am going
to read it to papa."
"But why does not papa read it him
self?"
"Oh," she said, with a sad little smile,
"papa is blind."
"And mamma?"
"Mamma goes out working, and poor
papa is lonely until I come home from
school. Then I read to him."
"Don't you ever read stories?"
"No; papa doesn't care for stories. Be
sides he's going to write a book on philoso
phy some day. He's going to tell me
what he wants to say, and I'll write it
down for him. Papa says we'll make lots
of money, and then mamma won'tfneed
to work."
And, with a happy smile, the child put
the learned volume in her satchel and
trotted down the stairs.
The Mechanics' Library on Saturday
afternoon presents a brighter and livelier
aspect than at any other time of the week.
Owing to its convenient location it is a sort
of rendezvous for ladies, young and old.
Here, when bent on shopping tours, visits
to the theater, etc, they meet their friends
and forth they go together. Many of
them return later when the male element
appears in the shape of homeward-bound
brothers, husbands and husbands-to-be.
A regular Saturday visitor there is a lady
dressed in deep mourning. She is young
and has a refined, spiritual face. There is
a strange Btory connected with her coming.
For two years she had been in the habit
of meeting her husband in the library on
Saturday afternoons. He always came a
few minutes after 5. When she saw him
enter her face would brighten, she would
quickly lay aside her book and, arm in
arm, off they would go like two lovers.
One Saturday, a few months ago, she
sat waiting aa usual. Five o'clock came,
and her eager face, needing only the light
of the one prescenceto enkindle it to radi
ance, was turned toward the door. A few
minutes later a close observer might have
noticed that her face blanched, that she
half rose from her chair and then sat
down with a gasp. But her husband did
not appear. Half-past 5, her look had be
come anxious ; at 6it was distressed. The
library was now almost empty. She could
no longer read, but rose and walked about.
She went to the outer door and looked up
and down the street for a familiar form.
None was in sight. She returned to her
seat. Then, as if unable to keep her anx
ious thoughts to herself, she turned to a
lady whose kindly face invited confidence
and said :
"Do you think any accident may have
happened to the Oakland train?"
"I do not know; but why do you ask?"
"My husband had to go to Oakland to
day on business, but he promised to meet
me here at the usual time. He has never
yet failed to keep his appointment, so I
fear something has happened."
"May not his business have detained
him longer than he anticipated?"
"Possibly. But what worries me is that
at the time that he always comes I thought
I saw him stagger in deathly pale and
holding his hand to his head. Once he
said jokingly that, dead or alive, he would
surely come."
The lady waited until 7 o'clock, then
said:
"I won't wait any longer. I'll go
home."
As she passed out she laid her card in
the hand of the sympathetic stranger.
The Sunday papers were full of a terri
ble accident that had happened the day
before at a little after 5 in the afternoon
to an Oakland train. Among those who
met death was the name of a man corre
sponding to the name on the card. The
man had been struck on the head and in
stantly killed. Whether his spirit had
kept the appointment or whether it was
a fancy of bis wife's brain the reader may
judge.
The lady still comes to the library on
Saturday afternoons. She sits in an ex-
pectant attitude, with her eyes riveted on
the door. A little after 5 she leans for
ward, a startled look comes into her eyes,
her pale face grows paler, she sighs deep
iy, then rises and goes home alone.
The Mercantile Library has a more re
tired air than the -other libraries. It is
never crowded. The people come and ro
softly ; they do not congregate in croups
to laugh and chat, and there are never
many who remain to read. In the recesses,
where there are tables and chairs,
there is entire privacy. In one of these
nooks may frequently be seen a small,
middle-aged lady, with deeply set eyes
and gentle face shaded hy soft gray hair.
She always comes in the morning, and,
choosing a sunny corner, seats herself at
the table, clasps her hands upon her lap
and gazes intently before her. She re
mains thus for hours, and appears to lose
consciousness of her surroundings. Her
attitude of constant meditation has made
her known as the "reflective lady." and
many are the surmises as to the subjects
upon which her thoughts are centered.
One morning her meditations were dis
turbed by a lady who sat down at the
same table and began to read. As she
read she passed her hand across her fore
head and pave a slight sigh. The reflec
tive lady noted the movement, and catch
ing the expression of pain said gently:
"Excuse me, mad a me, are you suffer
ing?"
The other looked up surprised, not only
at the question, but at the sympathetic
tone.
"Yes," she replied, "my head aches
dreadfully."
"Let me take your hand," said the
thoughtful lady. "Now, think that you
have no headache, that you are entirely
well. Do not allow your mind to wander
from this point."
The two sat thus for some time. Then
the one who had been suffering said
gaily:
"How well I feel. Have yon hypnotized
me?"
"Not at all," was the answer. "I have
simply cured you by will power. My
mind has convinced yours of your error
in supposing you had a headache."
"Well," said the other laughing,
"whether it was an error or a headache, I
am relieved and truly grateful. Do you
often," she continued, "exercise your heal
ing powers?"
"Yes; I have helped many people. I
am helping sufferers in the distance when
I sit silently here. In this place a peace
falls upon my spirit, such as will not ad
mit of the existence of any suffering,
physical or mental. This morning I have
been treating a man in the Mission who is
paralyzed. To-night I will hear how he
is. lam sure he is better."
The lady whose headache had been cured
opened her purse.
"No," said the other, interrupting the
movement, "don't offer me money. I
couldn't take it."
"Well, you'll let me thank you, won't
you?" extending her hand, which was
warmly pressed, and the two ladies parted.
The one who had found relief from the
headache went blithely out. The other re
sumed her former attitude of deep cogita
tion.
Presidential Autographs.
From the Collector it is learned that
Presidential years brings out a crop of in
teresting autographs. Sometimes it brings
entirely new men into the market, but
generally it lifts 25-cent and 50-cent speci
mens to a higher plane.
A Republican nomination will carry a
50-cent man to $150, while his election
will make it $3. if an entirely dark horse
should be chosen, his letters might easily
be quoted at from $5 to $10, as there would
be a great rush for him, and probably an
insufficient bupply.
For a long time Arthur was $10 to $12,
but is now $5 to $6. Collectors who have
complete sets of Presidents desire the new
men at once, and their competition drives
up the price.
As ex-President Harrison generally dic
tates his letters the price of his autograph
letter continues very high.
The Democratic Convention at Chicago
will help the value of some man for a
time, but it will probably fall back after
November.
McKinley's letters have never been very
plentiful and have generally sold atfl.
He is already worth $2 and will be higher
later on.
The letters of Vice- Presidents are never
in very great demand unleis for other rea
sons than holding that office. It is an of
fice of possibilities and amounts to very
little in itself.
With the new 1 President comes a new
batch of Cabinet officers and it generally
includes several unknown men. It is gen
erally months before any of their letters
turn up, but they come in time.
The autograph fiend is very busy in
these times, and bis pressing communica
tions form a large part of the mail of each
Presidential candidate. Liite the poor,
the fiend is always with us; but let us be
gentle with him, as often he graduates
into a reputable collector.

nicipal health and stability and broad
promise have not been attained without
several struggles worthy of a page in the
annais of civil government. Its last and
greatest fight for its liberties has been in
full accord with its peaceful, rural sur
roundings; it has been a fight for all that
is near and dear to every patriotic citi
zenâ"The Home."
Like all incorporated towns the citizens
elected their City Council, "from the peo
ple, to serve the people, for the people,"
but a factional fight arose within this
Council of Fathers. Its inception is hard
to trace, but the City Council (whether
through pique or false notions of economy
is immaterial so far as results are con
cerned) disbanded the Fire Department
without providing any other means what
ever of protection against the possible
ravages of fire. This action, so unex
pected and so menacing to the public
safety, took the citizens by surprise. For
some days this was the great topic of dis
cussion, on every street corner and at
every place of congregation. A public
meeting was called and resolutions passed
"prayiig the City Council to take steps
to protect the property and lives of its
citizens." It was a fair demand made in
a constitutional manner, by the best men
and wemen of the city, but for three long
weeka ibis request was ignored, and then
two fiÂ«es, claimed to be of incendiary
origin fthe firebugs are now in jail await
ing trid), awoke the citizens to the neces
sity of in immediate reconstruction of the
Fire Department, and, if necessary, the
impeadimer.t of certain members of the
City Crancil.
Witbthat swift action which ever char
acterize the aroused temper of Americans
an indjrnation mass-meeting was held, at
tended by over 1500 taxpayers, and for
three sours the Salinas Pavilion echoed
with tie rise and fall of the voices demand
ing inttant action for the public weal and
safety. This meeting unanimously rein
statedthe old Fire Department, gave back
its coitrol to the esteemed Chief, "Tom"
Joy. a young man whom the citizens es
teem for his proved ability in fighting
flamei and directing his charges. This
meethg even went further and appointed
a coamittee of four of its leading citizens
to take immediate steps, if found neces
sar}',to impeach the derelict members of
the Gty Council.
SuÂ«h then is the brief sketch of a fight
for ptotection which was fought openly
and ron honorably in Salinas, the valley
city. When one comes to consider that for
three-weeks by a foolish action of the
countil hundreds of thousands of dollars'
wortl of property was jeopardized,
thouands of lives in danger and a wbolo
townliable to have its policies canceled â
or rewritten at much higher ratesâ one
recojnizes how miserable it is to see public
officeused to satisfy private spleen, and
how ommendable was the action of these
Salitus citizens in effecting the reform in
sucln peaceable manner. This action In a
gravf public situation has won the hearty
approbation of the insurance companies
espedally and thousands of Californiana
moregenerally.
It i to these citizens that Ciaus Spreck
els las decided to give the largest sugar
beet actory in the world. It is from these
peope that this industry is to obtain its
latest and greatest impetus. It is from
such public-spirited and loyal actions that
the yesent and future welfare of Cali
fornii is to be maintained and strength
ened.
Derliction of duty in public officials
needaimmediate reproof, and this lesson
in mmicipal correction given by the citi
zens if Salinas to its City Council is worthy
of emulation by all those who wish pure
goveoment, which defined means the
greatJ3t good for the greatest number.

Eyed Gelestials
It sometimes takes the "heathen Chi
nee" a little while to find out a good thing,
but when he does he makes the best of it
and also tells his friends about it so that
they may enjoy it. A good tiling in the
eye of a Chinese is something that costs
nothing.
This fact was made manifest at the last
''free day" at the Hopkins Institute of
Art. How the Chinese found out about it
is Dot known, but they came in swarms,
while on all previous free days they were
conspicuous by their absence. There were
nearly 250 of them. Since the institution
has been open less than a dozen have paid
ior admission.
But all things considered, the Mon
golians conducted themselves very well
and showed a greater interest in the works
of art, paintings and sculpture than in the
house and the furnishings.
Secretary Martin had only one trouble
with the Almond-eyed visitors. That was
to make them take off their hats. But
once they had them off they kept them off
as long as they were in the building. It
looked a little odd to see the Chinese with
thftir uncoutn garments sitting on $500
embroidered silk chairs; but on the whole
they showed no respect for these things,
while the pictures threw them into a state
of excitement and even reverence.
Little groups of Chinese would get in
front of a picture or statue and discuss it
in the most interested manner. They
would go quite close to it and point to the
different portions, but not one was seen
to put his finger on a work of art. Strange
as it may seem, the Chinese were the most
interested in tne works of the best mas
ters. Mnrillo, Verestchagin, Dupre and
the other chefs-d'osuvre came in for
praise, while the mediocre work was not
noticed.
During all the day not a Chinaman was
seen to attempt to open a closet or table
drawer, or to attempt to investigate the
works of any ot the clocks. They did not
try the faucets of the wash basins, nor ask
to ride in the elevator. In fact, their con
duct was most gentlemanly, and when, at
times, they spoke excitedly, their voices
were always low.
When closing time came, Secretary Mar
tin was given a surprise in the shape of a
vote of thanks from his Celestial visitors.
None of the white visitors had ever done
anything of the kind, so it took him some
time to recover from the shock. A very
dignified and well-dressed Chinese who
spoke English perfectly came forward,
and bowing courteously said : "I want to
thank, on behalf of my countrymen here,
whoever has been good enough to give us
the treat we have enjoyed to-day. It has
been a surprise to us, and I am sure we
have all profited from the privilege of
gazing at your priceless works of art. It j
broadens a man's ideas to come to a place ;
like this, and you may rest assured that
we appreciate all that has been done
for us."
WONDERFUL CATS

of Intelligence.
Their names are Chuffy a nd Svengali.
They are members of the cat family and
both are gentlemen. In addition they are
two of the prettiest and best educated cats
that ever aspired to histrionic fame.
With this brief introduction as to their
names and character it is not meet that
the tale should end. The marked ability
displayed by these feline gentlemen is
such that none can fail to be interested.
"Chuff" and "Sven," as they are famil
iarly called, are the pride and especial
pets of Mrs. L. D. Adam, wife of the as
sistant city editor of The Call. Though
Mrs. Adam is not desirous of posing as an
animal trainer, she has succeeded in
teaching her two beautiful black cats to
do a few tricks that are perfectly wonder
ful.
To begin with Chuffy, the larger; his
mistress will call him to her and say:
"Now, Chuff, prepare for your dinner."
Chuffy will immediately rear upon his
haunches, lick his paws clean and smooth
down bis glossy fur.
A chair is then placed with its back to
the table and a plate of meat cut in small
pieces placed near it. After tying a nap
kin around his neck, Chuffy is ordered to
take his place at the table and eat his
meal. Standing upon his Launches in the
chair, the intelligent animal will lean over
the bacK of the chair, take a piece of meat
in his paw and convey it to his mouth.
This is continued until the meat has dis
appeared.
Strangely enough, however, if the nap
kin is not tied round his neck prior to the
meal, Chuffy will at once gobble up tb.e
meat just like any ordinary cat, and can
A PAIR OF WONDERFUL CATS
PICTURESQUE SGENES ON THE CHANNEL.
The most picturesque part of the San
Francisco water front is undoubtedly that
part known as the channel, although,
strictly speaking, it is not the water front
at aIL The channel is a natural water
way that comes in from the bay a few
blocks below Townsend street, but it has
been so improved and deepened that it ap
pears to be a canal. Both sides are lined
with bulkUeads, and bridges have been
built across at frequent intervals. It is
about 200 feet wide.
It is the combination of these things
that gives the channel its picturesque
aspect together with the variety of craft
to be seen there at all times. The large
four-masted ship, with graceful masts
that seem to scrape the sky, has little
place in the maritime architecture of the
channel. Instead there are all manner of
other craft that seem to have been de
not be made to pick up one piece at a time
with his paw.
Next, Svengali is given a chance to dis
play his talent. A stick about three feet
in length is held vertically with one end
resting on the floor. At the command to
show bis claws "Sven" will stand on his
hind feet, and, distending his claws as far
as he can, reach up and get a firm clutch
on the stick. Then he will slowly lift his
nind feet off the floor and hang at arm's
length from the stick.
Chuffy is very jealous of this particular
performance on the part of his chum, and
never fails to slip up and tickle him on the
hind feet. He will keep this annoyance
up till "Sven" drops from the stick and
climbs upon a chair for protection.
When it comes to an instrumental solo
Chuffy is an expert. He will climb upon
the stool and hammer the keys of the
piano until the whole rooms resound with
the strains of what, from its lack of mel
ody, approaches very nearly to some con
ceptions of opera. "Sven" cannot be
induced to play the piano alone, but after
a deal of coaxing and a bit of meat, will
climb upon the stool beside Chuffy and
assist in a duet.
" Chuffy's best trick, and it is a rarity
among cats, is to retrieve. A bird's wing
is shaken before him, and in an instant he
is alert and on his haunches, waiting for
it to be thrown. As it leaves Mrs. Adam's
hand he bounds forward, picks it up and
brings it back to her feet. He will even
climb upon a chair and take it from be
hind a picture.
There is only one thing Chuffy will re
trieve and that is a bird's wing. If a
chicken's wing is used it is no go with
Chuffy. "Sven' 1 will do the clown act in
this piece, too. As soon as he gets the
wing he will run under the lounge and
stay there till he is given a piece Of meat
to bring the wing out.
Both cats will lie down at the order and
feign death. They are very fond of each
other and are frequently found curled up
near each other basking in the sun's ray.

signed for artists to exercise their pen
cils and brushes on.
The location of the channel in the lowest
part of San Francisco, surrounded on all
sides by all sorts of factories that con
stantly throw off volumes of smoke and
| steam, gives an atmospheric effect not
I common in this part of the world. At
certain hours of the day the combinations
of color are truly as rich as were ever seen
on the Thames.
There is no part of the channel that is
not picturesque. From the mouth all the
way up to the lumber-yard at the end both
sides arÂ» a combination of lines not easy
to duplicate. And the number and
variety of picturesque craft. Close to the
mouth are the iishine-boats. All kinds.
Junks, sloops, lateen rigs, scows and
schooners, all having that "loose" quality
so pleasing to artists.

Evicted! What a terrible sound the
word has and what a terrible thing evic
tion really is under some circumstances,
but not under all circumstances. There
are times when it sounds ludicrous; there
are times when eviction is just, becauae
there are people who make it a business
to pay one month's rent in advance and
then refuse to pay more. Their object is
then to remain in the place as long as
possible before being thrown out by the
Sheriff.
When such a state of affairs exists it
usually takes the landlord about three
months to get rid of his undesirable ten
ants. Such evictions are common in cer
tain parts of the City and furnish amuse
ment for the neighbors, who crowd around
to see the "fun." There are no tears shed
on such occasions. Profanity is indulged
in by the evicted persons instead of tears.
Cases of people being evicted Irom their
homer, on account of poverty and sickness
are extremely rare. The honest working
people will generally pay their rent even
though they have to go without food.
The oyster-boats are not unusual-looking
craft, but when they come into the chan
nel, laden with piles of bivalves and their
sides dripping with the mud from the
bottom of the bay, they produce combina
tions of grays that would surely throw
Whistler in ecstasies. The buildings
where these boats unload are old and have
a most delightful combination of lines in
their make-up.
The hayboats are not as picturesque
as other craft close by. But they are odd
looking, and, if they happen to be heavily
laden with the golden harvest of the bot- '
torn lands, will make a splotch of brilliant
color little short of surprising. But ail
the craft in the channel are picturesque.
The lumber steamers that, uuder ordinary
conditions, look ugly, are most pleasing
in appearance when surrounded by
schooners with tall masts and graceful
When they are in distress the landlord
generally "sees" that their case is brought
before the Associated Charities and at
tended to. To evict such people is dan
gerous in many ways and the landlord
may have to pay some sort of damages as
well as Bring his house into disrepute.
The owner of a large house on Fourth
street evicted a poor family about a year
ago. The act was such a heartless one
that all the other tenants moved out, and !
his house is only partly filled up even now
and at a much lower rent than he had
ever received. For four months there was
not a tenant in it, and he lost more than
if he had allowed the poor family to remain
there rent free for ten years.
The kind of evictions of common occur
rence are similar to the case of Mrs.
Schneider, who was made to leave her
house on Natoma street a few days ago.
Mrs. Schneider's name is no guide to her
nationality, for she was born in Ireland.
She has given considerable trouble to the
police on account of her fondness for cer
tain liquids. Her husband was a German
rigging. The tug?, river steamers, mud
scows, dredgers and many others all have
a beauty of their own, not to be measured
by symmetry of form.
Even the common steel bridge across
the channel at Fourth street is pleasing in
appearance when a number of vessels are
going through. The combination of
masts, sails and riirgine with clouds of
smoke from the tugs drifting here and
there produces a most animated scene. It
is a lively one also, and the screech of
whistles and the screaming of orders from
captains fill the air.
Life on the channel is also v picturesque.
The people who work on the ships and
along tho shores seem to have been cre
ated to fit in just the place they occupy.
See that fisherman with the red shirt and
green trousers, all too large for him, work
ing in his boat of orange and blue. How
tailor who went away one night about
eight years ago after she had split the
side of his head with a poker, and never
came back. She has been unable to find
him, although he is most likely in San
Francisco, Decause he sends her money.'
Mrs. Schneider moved into her last
house about four months ago. She paid
$5 for one month's rent of two rooms, and
no more. Since then the law has been at
work to get her out, so she has had four
months' rent for the price of one.
After much red tape had been gone
through with, the Sheriff and his men
came and carried all her household goods
to the sidewalk and dumped them in a
heap. The stove was on top of the mattress,
and buckets and flatirons were mixed in
confusion with chairs and tables.
Mrs. Schneider watched the men at work
without saying a word, and followed them
in silence to the street. She had been
through the same thing many times. A
policeman and a small crowd were on
hand, but the Sheriff and his deputies got
out of the road as fast as possible,
the brown nets that he is mending har
monize with everything else and what a
bit of contrast the whole makes on the
surface of the dancing, sunlit waters.
And the skippers of the bay schooners.
Surely they look more like ttie ideal sea
dogs than do the men who nowadays
stand on the bridges of ocean greyhounds.
No style for them. Blue clothes and blue
caps are the limit, but all so worn and
weather-beaten as to tone down into a sort
of gra}\ The longshoremen, the lumber
men, the tramps, the fruit-venders and
ever, the policemen are all picturesque.
There is something about their garmentE
and the way they carry themselves that
makes them seem to blend into their sur
roundings instead of being adisturbins
element. But then as has been stated
they live where even the atmosphere
is picturesque.
"You're a nice one to be standing by
see a poor woman thrown out into the
street," said Mrs. Schneider, turning to
the policeman. "What are you paid for
I'd like to know? Why don't you arrest
them robbers? You haven't time, but I'll
report you to Mayor Sutro and he'll give
you plenty or time. Go along with you,
you lazy beer sign."
At this stage of the game the landlord
came by to assure himself that he was at
last rid of his unprofitable tenant.
"There's the monopolist and robber," she
screamed, rushing at him and shaking her
fist under nis nose, "who makes his livinsr
by grinding the life-blood out of poor
people. Thief! Thief! Thief! I know
you and I ain't afraid to tell the world all
about you."
"Madam," ventured the landlord,
"don't you dare use such language to me
orâ"
"You won't do nuthin' o' de kind,' 1
said a big, fat young man in the crowd.
"Dat lady's my mudder an' I kin lick
eny geeser like yon wot tawKs to her."
"Here, you, Schneider," said the police
mar., "keep your tongue out of this or
you'll go back to the place you just spent
three months IB for sneaking that lead
pipe."
The dutiful son subsided at once and
the landlord made his escape, while Mrs.
Schneider filled the air with blue-tinted
profanity. The landlord and the police
man came in for a bitter tongue-lashing.
The officer at last told Mrs. Schneider that
if she didn't stop he would "send for the
vagon."
Mrs. Schneider knows what Ibe wagon
means and her fury vanished in a mo
ment. Reaching into her pocket, she
took out a large red handkerchief and,
untying the corner, disclosed eight silver
dollars. "Here, boys," turning to the
crowd of loafers, "carry my things to
Lanigan's in the next block. I'm going to
take the rooms he has to rent, and after
paying the rent for a month there'll be
enough left to buy the big bucket full of
beer^"

| many of the downtown street corners,
1 where in days gone by he used to do a
; thriving business during the hours be
j tween sunset and midnight, know him no
more.
His little boiler filled with the concoc
tions of chicken < ?), red pepper, tomatoes,
! cornmeal and shucks no longer fills the
J evening atmosphere with savory odors
j borne on the ttearu that comes forth every
time he raises Uie lid to serve a customer.
I No more does his cheerful voice call hii
I wares to the passer-by. And no more do
; the passers-by stop to buy ol the few
| tamale men who are Jeft. even though
: many of them reduced the pries of each
I bit of indigestion to 5 cents.
Herein may be tho solution of the mys
i tery of the passing of the tamale man, lor
| it hardly seems possible that the juicy
j concoction can really contain chicken in
I view of the prices asked lor the fowl. In
i any of the markets a chicken weighing
! from 12 to 14 ounces will cost about 40
! cents. How, then, is it possible for a
tamale sold for 5 cents to contain at least
three ounces of drumstick?
If it is not chicken, what is it? Hor
j rors! Don't think of it! Imagination
j suggests all sorts of thingsâ cats, puppies,
â  jackrabbits and even rats. The fact of
i the case is, to do the tamale man justice,
! tnat veal is the "filler" often used. The
j delicate white tender meat readily absorbs
! the fiery flavors of red pepper, etc., and
] can be bought for about 8 cents a pound.
I It is almost impossible to tell the differ
ence by taste.
Bnt that is not accounting for the dis
j appearance of the venders.
The man on the corner of Powell and
j Market streets gave as his reason for the
| decline in his business the fact that many
| small restauiants and saloons have cone
! into the tamale business. These places
s are very careful in the preparation of their
i wares and many of them make them in
j view of their customers. All the ingre
| dieuts are shown to be clean and the
j "chicken" is shown to be chicken.
As these places make a business of serv
| ing coffee or beer with tamales and also
j provide a clean place to eat, it follows that
people will go in them instead of standing
on the curbstone and throwing the shucks
!in the gutter, it is certainly much more
dignified. For awhile many people used
to buy tamales from the men on the
street and then go into some saloon and
eat them.

Become a Gonfirmed patron
of the Beer Saloorv
Out on Natoma street, near Seventh,
there lives a doe whose business in life is
to buy beer. Not to purchase the amber
fluid by the carload or hogshead, or even
the barrel, but in very small quantities.
So small that it is generally called "rush
insr the growler."
The dog belongs to a man named Smith
and is known to the whole neighborhood
a.? "Carl." A very appropriate name, all
tnings considered, although the dog wouM,
most likely. be just as much pleased if he
were called "Friiz." Carl's owner says
that he is a pointer, but judging from the
general appearance of the Uog there are a
good many other brreds in his composi
tion. He really looks a great deal more
like a gigantic Scotch terrier than any
thing else. He also appears to be very
lazy. His bones look to be too big for his
skin, which in turn looks to be too big for
his bones, so that he Ambles along in a
careless sort of way and seems ready to
drop to pieces at any moment.
When Mr. Smith wants beer he simply
whistles for Carl and the shaggy specimen
of canine comes on the jump. An old
battered tin bucket that in its day has
carried the material for many a good time
is given to him. Carl takes the handle in
his mouth and the money is put in the
bucket. The sum is generally five cent?,
and Mr. Smith makes it a business to have
that amount always on hand. Carl at
once starts for Sullivan's on the corner.
Mr. Sullivan knows Carl, and after taking
the nickel he puts the proper amount of
beer in the bucket and the dog at once
starts home to his thirsty master. If the
day happens to be Sunday Carl will very
likely repeat the trip in a few minutes.

HONOR IN ATHLETIG SPORTS
Baird's Valuable Suggestions to Amateurs.
Eastern Club J^etkods
Upon this subject I have had very little
to say heretofore, but have decided to
dwell for awhile, in the hopes of correct
ing, or at least assisting to correct, some
of the evils that eat like a canker-worm
into the very heart of holiest sport and
manly exercise.
Without athletic honor there is little
true pleasure or progress, in either com
petition or exercise. We lay a great deal
of stress on the distinction between an
amateur and a professional; theoretically
the difference is that a professional sub
ordinates pleasure to gain â an amateur
subordinates gain to pleasure. Now if an
amateur hunts greedily for medals, jew
elry and silverware, or regards such
plunder as the object of his efforts, he is
no better than a professional. Worse
still, if he thirsts for glory regardless of
the prizes, but resorts to unfair or un
worthy means to achieve his end, he is no
better than the lowest tricksters.
Let me make myself understood in re
gard to the term "Professionals." There
are two kinds. One kind engage in the
work in order to earn an honest living;
some teach in gymnasiums, some as swim
ming teachers: others engage in athletic
competitions, such as running or rowing,
for what they can honestly make out
of their speed or skill. Still others be
come pugilists and seldom have any re
gard for athletic ethics, although there
are exceptions. But there is another class
;vho engage in the work for what they can
make at it regardless of whom they can
bleed.
Now, if a man engages in competition,
Athletic honor would be in a very bad way
on the Pacific Coast were it not for the sturdy
efforts of John Elliot. For years he has stood
as a bulwark against those in the Pacific Ath
letic Association and in the Olympic Club who
have sought to chalk over the line of demarca
tion between the professional and the ama
teur. He has been first and foremost in de
claring to both classes by word and by pen,
"Thus far shalt thou go and no farther." His
recent determined stand was actuated by a
sincere desire to preserve the integrity of the
laws of athletics.
calling himself an amatenr yet resorting
to mean devices to gain possession of the
coveted prize (I say coveted), he is on a
level with "crooked" pedestrians, who
travel around among country fair? in
some countries and localities with the
sole purpose of "working" the green but
conceited countrymen who think they can
run.
Among the practices that I have known
so-called amateurs to be guilty of are
pocketing, jostling and crossing. Pocket
ing is for one man to take the cur* with
another behind him, who is the victim.
On the right of the latter is another man,
an accomplice of the first. After awhile
the pace gets too hot for the leader and
his partner, and then the trick is played.
Number two cannot forge ahead for he
will step on the heels of the leader, neither
can he swing out, for the man on his right
prevents him.
He must take his choice of either stay
ing where he is or dropping behind and
losing about five yards, which would be
fatal. Jostling is simply to elbow another,
and I have known cases where men have
had to drop out of a race in consequence.
Crossing is to deliberately pass across a
man's path and take the curb. The man
crossed must necessarily slow up, which
in a short distance run virtually throws
him out of the race.
Now it seems incredible to honest people
that young men who consider themselves
amateurs, and particularly gentlemen,
conld be guilty of such practices, but
sometimes they are. It is to be stated that
such instances are rare, but I have known
such things to occur. I have known in
stances where men nave been disqualified
for crossing another's path.
True, it was unintentional; but, instead
of the man in question accepting the
punishment in good grace, promising
himself not to do such a thing again, not
only he but his companions take it as a
personal insult, and say all manner of
hard things about the referee.
I distinctly remember a case of this
kind occuring in the championship games
of this coast in 1891. In one of the short
distance runs there were two rivals strain
ing every nerve to lead. It Happened that
I stood at the railing on the last curve
and the inspector and I occupied a better
position than any one else to see what
followed.
As they came to the curve one man
forged a little ahead of the otherâ only
about a yardâ and then deliberately
crossed in iront of the other and took the
curve. This movement compelled the one
who was fouled to slow ud, and he came
n second best at the finish. When the
referee heard the claim that was lodged
on the spot, and the testimony of the in
spector on the curve, he promptly dis
qualified the offender.
The result was that the one disqualified
and his friends were bitter and prejudiced
against the referee and the man who made
the claim though the latter was fouled to an
extent that shocked me. They certainly
did not display the spirit either of ama
teurs or gentlemen of honor.
Many years ago I had my attention
called to a newspaper paragraph which
illustrates my point A race was started
on a certain occasion, but by some
bungle of the official in charge a certain
man was sent off his mark five seconds
earlier than he should have been. He was
notified by the starter that he must beat
the next man five seconds in order to
win. When the race was over and he
found that he was not five seconds ahead,
instead of making a claim and a disturb
ance he quietly asked if his was second
place, and on being so informed went off
to the dressing-room and refused to be in
dignant. The paper in question mar
veled at "so much frankness, which," it
stated, "is refreshing in this era of chican
ery."
There is a point on which I find partic
{ ular fault with the clubs and colleges on
this coast. There seems to be an idea pre
vailing that a man to be your competitor
must necessarily be your enemy. In some
sections of the country a club would ap
plaud a tine performance achieved by a
| member of another cl ub almost as vigorous
| ly as if the successful man was their own
clubmate. That is generous, and I like to
see it. This favoritism I do not like. I like
to see an admirable performance applauded
by everybody, regardless of who he is or
where he is from, provided he is a worthy
man and fulfills the rules. At a set of
games held recently on this coast it was
depressing to see the assembled mem
bers of a certain institution yell them
selves into convulsions if a comrade won
a race, no matter how insignificant the
performance may have been otherwise.
On the contrary, if a member of another
club or college should perform in an ex
ceptional manner he was received in chill
ing silence by the members of said
institution. This shows a narrow
spirit. A man does not have one
atom less of esprit-de-corps by show
ing a broad and generous spirit toward
otners. It i 3 this good feeling that bene
fits athletics in general and thereby the
clubs in particular. What 1 like to see is
for a beaten man to go to his more suc
cessful rival after the race and congratu
late him. It costs nothing, makes your
competitor feel kindly toward you, and
lifts you up and sets you apart from the
common herd of mankind.
Bupt>ose now a member of your club
gets beaten by the member of another.
Stop and think what the effect on the
other fellow and the other club would be
if you and your clubmates were to go to
him before he had left the grounds, con
gratulate h:m and say something compli
mentary about his performance. Do you
not think that he would tell his friends
that you were all good fellows?
Some years ago I read a story which
impressed me deeply. At a set of games
held by a high school in England on the
occasion of what we call a commence
ment, two boys were pitted against each
other in a hurdle race. The significance
of the result is best understood when it
is explained that the winners of the re
spective events would dine with the
faculty at the annual banquet-
One of the boys was an aristocrat and
the other a plebeian. The former entered
the race with a full intention of winnine,
but when half way through and he passed
the grand stand leader by a few yards he
heard a pathetic cry and caught sight of
two white and anxious faces in the front
row, which he instantly recognized as the
mother and sister of his rival.
Then it flashed across him how much
more it meant for the other boy to win
than himselfâ the dinner, the association
with the professor?, the prominence for
one of humble station (something we lit
tle understand in this Republic). There
were two more flights to be taken, one was
cleared in magnificent style, and then the
friends of the leader wondered why his
foot caught the last hurdle. They are
probably wondering yet, but he knows the
reason. Can you guess it? At any rate it
is not difficult to determine the moral
character of one who would make such a
sacrifice.

Among the contributors to the columns
of Harper's Weekly is a young writer by
The recognized leader of amateur athletics
in America in unquestionably the subject of
our sketch, William B. Curtis. Until last year
he had held the most responsible positions in
the Amateur Athletic Union, holding the office
of president as a finishing touch to his career.
His experience in athletic exercises over since
the close of the war, including sprint running,
weight-lifting and throwing and rowing, in all
of which he was foremost in his day, his posi

Times of New York, and above all, his uncom
promising attitude on records and the defini
tion of an amateur have given him his envi
able position as the father of athletics.
the name of Caspar Whitney. This young
man has attracted considerable attention
by reason of his remarks concerning peo
ple and things, and among others the Pa
cific Coast and the athletes of the Far
West.
Whether his allegations are correct or
otherwise I will not at present discuss;
unfortunately there are many things con
nected with our amateur athletic affairs
that need a severe overhauling, but I am
firmly convinced that the officers of the
Pacific Athletic Association are conscien
tiously trying to do their duty. Consider
ing the odds under which they labor I
think they have succeeded remarkably
well, lor the clubs, and panicuiarly the
athletes, have a wholesome respect for the
central organization, which is saying a
great deal. Very few people know what
an orthodox amateur is; and when that is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
the case it is not to be wondered at that so
many violations of the rule occur.
About a montn ago I received a letter
from an athletic friend in New York, in
which said friend cast some severe reflec
tions upon the association and athletics
in general on this coast. I havf not
showed the letter to anyone, consequently
I am not betraying any confidence. I
have laid it ande carefully, intending to
answer it in print when opportunity oc
curred.
We read that when we try to pick a
mote or speck out of our neighbor's eye it
is wise first to cast the beam or log out of
our own eye, in order that we may see
clearly. If un atom of dust has lodged in
your eye certainly you would not call
upon one who has a cinder in his own to
help you.
Eastern athletics are corrupt and honey
combed to an extent that we know little of
out here. The New York Athletic Club,
for instance, bas its grounds on Travers
Is and, a beautiful spot on Long Island
Sound, near the metropolis. During the
season it is the policy of the club to "keep"
a learn of athletes in constant training.
There is a trainer in attendance, with as
sistants if necessary, a training-table,
lodgings, and I am even informed that
clothing is furnished.
To put it in another way, these athletes
have nÂ©. visible means of support outside
of the club; and they are provided with
all the necessaries of life on consideration
of their representing the club in such races
as the management may direct. If
any one on the team while in train
ing desires leave of absence it
is necessary to cut any quantity of red
tape in order to get away. For as much
as three months at a time these men, un
der tne guise of being amateurs, are har
bored by an organization, the oldest in the
East, which should be the citadel and blah
tower of pure amateurism, but which is
really professional at heart.
The true amateur athlete is the one who
earns his daily bread and indulges in exer
cise and racing because he enjoys it, and
because it makes him strong. But how can
such a one hope to compete with those
who devote the same time and attention
that the professional gives to it?
A man leaning over a desk, writ
ing for dear life, scarcely moving all day,
in an office that has little sun in it; or one
laboring over some trade like upholster
ing for nine hours a day â how can such
men hold their own against those who
live at the track and spend most of their
time on it?
I call to mind the name of H. H. Baxter,
who won the championship of America at
pole vaulting from 1883 to 1886, and for
many years held the best on record. Mr.
Baxter was an heir to a considerable for
tune and had all the leisure he desired to
humor his inclinations. But such in
stances are rare; fortunately for bona
fide amatenrs the wealthy young men
of our country find hard training too much
like work; I say '"fortunately," as I be
lieve it is impossible to legislate or provide
against it. But in the instances where
young men with no visible means of sup
port are taken up by some wealthy club,
fed and housed for months at a time, with
dark rumors floating around about cloth
ing and spending-money provided â I say
it is not healthy for true amateur athlet
ics, nor is it good for the morals or the
future of the young men in question.
There is an opportunity for Mr. Whitney
to show his zeal for immaculate athletics
by letting the under dog alone for a while,
and hitting the big fellow for a change, for
he needs it. Geo. D. Baird.
GREAT RENTAL
CALCULATORS
Illiterate Boys Who /Astonished
the World With Jheir Mathe
metical Feats
With but a few exceptions the great
mental calculators known to fame have
been of humble origin and uneducated
and have not distinguished themseives in
any other sphere of activity. Thomas
Fuller, "the Virginian calculator," was a
slave who could neither read nor write
and he died as ignorant as ever at the age
of 80. Jedediari Buxton,who was examined
by tt.e Royal Society of London toward
the middle of last century, could find
mentally in five hours the exact number
of cubic eighths of an inch in a body
measuring 23,145,789 yards by 5,642,732
yards by 64,965 yards, but could not write
his own name. When taken to see Gar
rick in "Richard ill" at Drury Lane his
sole criticism was to the effact that the to
tal number of words uttered was 12,445,
the number in Garrick's part being regis
tered separately. Like Pascal, Ampere
and Gauss, the celebrated mathematicians,
showed precocity as children with regard
to figures, but their subsequent devotion
to mathematics served to overshadow
their capabilities as calculators. Zerah
Colburn, born at Vermont in 1804, does
not appear to have had any particular
education. His autobiographical account
of his performances is exceedingly bom
bastic and probably untrustworthy. He
seems, moreover, to have lost his powers
at the comparatively early age of 20.
Mangiamele, a Sicilian herdboy, who, at
the age of 10, was presented by Arago to
the Academy of Sciences in Paris, and
who, among other feats, extracted the
cube root of 3, 796, 416 (â 156) in thirty
seconds, was totally illiterate. Dase, born
in 1824, was a noted calculator, but de
voted his faculty to the composition of
tables of logarithms. He is said to have
multiplied together mentally two num
bers of 100 figures each in eight and three
quarter hours. The problem no doubt
could be done more rapidly by a good cal
culator in the ordinary way, but the effort
of memoiy demanded by its mental solu
tion is simply stupendous. It is noted
that Dase possessed a remarkable rapidity
of perception and visual memory with re
gard to objects seen, as, for example, in
recognizing the number of volumes in a
library. Henri Moiuleux, who was also
the subject of examination by the Aca
demy of Sciences, was born in 1826, and
was the ;son of a poor wood-cutter of
Tours. In addition to feats of the usual
kind he was capable of solving questions
of an indeterminate nature. Thus, when
asked to find two numbers of which the
squares differ by 133, he gave immediately
66 and 67. A simpler solution being re
quested he then gave, after a moment's re
flection, 6 and 13. Mundeux, like other
great calculators, had a very bad memory
for other things, such as the names of
places and persons. He died in obscurity
in 1862. George Bidder, the English
"Calculating Boy" and civil engineer,
must be distinguished as almost the only
great mental calculator who, while retain
ing his abilities as such, attained an emi
nent position in another walk of life.
The practice of the harp has almost died
out in Wales.
TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR
Yet These Little JKings May JMaUe or Mar
Health ar\d Beauty
Portia and I were playing battledore in
the long hall. This is an old-fashioned
amusement, by the way â Ions: since for
gotten in our eagerness to fence
and box, to ride a wheel or swing
the clubs. Nevertheless. 1 question
whther any of these muscle - devel
oping accomplishments are of more
real value than the graceful old game.
Those stately ladies and slender maidens
who still live upon great canvases; who
are associated in our minds with ancestral
hails and courtly charms; who knew now
to descend a stair or cross a floor with a
firm, light grace and a dignity to which
even our athletic girl nowadays seldom
attains â those ladies and maidens used to
play "battledore" and "graces" in the
great halls and on the terraces, and the
diversion must have been a great help in
developing tha poise and balance and
graceful dignity, the fame of which still
lives. Our young ladies' seminaries that
set girls to climbing ladders and lifting
weights to the time of the gymnasium
piano would do well to revive these old
games. They are capital for developing
the chest, for training the eye, for
strengthening and suppling and round
ing the wrist and arm, and for giving con
trol over those unruly members of grow
ing girlhood, the elbows. They are full of
demand, not so much upon strength as
upon agility and dexterity. Quick turns,
light springs, swift little runs, deft man
ipulations and delightful fun make them
the most spontaneous of exercises.
The athletic girl is apt to regard them
SHUTTLECOCK AND BATTLEDORE.
with fine scorn as ultra- feminine back
numbers. Perhaps, however, this is not
the only mistake that the athletic girl is
making to-day.
But this is by way of digression.
Battledore-and-.shuttlecock was not to
have been my theme this day. Portia and
I were playing battledore-and-shuttlecoctr
in the long hall when the sound of the
front-door bell brought our game to a
close.
Portia hastily gathered up the battle
d6res and the feathered corks and thrust
them into a drawer of a high oak stand.
In closing the drawer, which she did as
ninety-nine women out of a hundred
would have done, by pressing her knee
against it, it stuck, and required a little
tug and pull, then another shove with
the knee, when it went back with a rush.
"Ouch!" exclaimed Portia, and rubbed
her knee.
The next day it was black and blue and
quite sore. Portia had forgotten the epi
sode of the drawer and was at a loss to
know why her knee should be lame. She
mentioned it to her friend the doctor,
who, upon being assured that there hud
been no possible chance of its receiving an
injury, talked learnedly of disturbed cir
cnlaiion caused by nervous conditions
attendant upon life in this high-pressure
age, recommended exercise and gave her
eorae little pills in a bottle. Afterward I J
reminded Portia oi the drawer and she
laughed over her own stupidity.
Probably two -thirds of the cases of
"white swelling 1 - that come into our hos
pitals are traceable to this trick, so preva- !
lent among us of using the knee as a sort I
of third hand in shutting drawers, moving
articles of furniture and pushing things.
The knee is a rather wonderful joint, and,
probably the most delicate in the body.
"A weak knee" is a common thing among
men and women, but particularly among
women who are constantly busy about the
home, and who as constantly find it con
venient to set things to rights about the
room by a thrust of the knee. A taulty
habit of walking, high heels and tight
garters, whether above or below the knee,
are all productive of much mischief at this
point. Those fond mothers who follow
ti.e inane fashion of putting young chil
dren into socks, that leave the cannng
little knees bare, are laying a sure founda
tion for early development of rheumatism
in these joints. A child's knees and an
kles, particularly in this cJimate, should
always be well protected, yet bare, blue,
chilled knees on prettily dressed boys and
girls of four or five years are a frequent
and painful spectacle on our streetcars
and ferry-boats.
A good deal of the spinal and lung trou
ble of to-dayâ and somehow, despite the
"enormous strides science has made" in j
this age, these troubles seem almost as \
common as everâ is due to the way we sit.
To the "railroad spine," the "bicycle
spine." the "writer's spine" and all the
rest of them might, in justice, be added
the high-chair spine.
Our grandmothers sat primly and prop
erly upon high-backed chairs, with their
feet upon the floor and their spines erect.
Our young people are often charged to do
this, and grandma is frequently heJd np
before the lounging girl as an example to
be imitated. In point of fact, though,
grandma, while she sits up straighter, has
I not a much stronger back than has her
daughter, who leans, or even lounges, in a
ladylike way, and, when she dares, crosses
j her knees. Few men or women to-day sit
truly and properly in the position nature
designed that they should. We lean back
and bring our shoulders forward, contract
ing chest and lungs. We slide forward
until we rest upon the broad, flat bone
near the end of the spins, with the coccyx,
the series of small terminal bones, bent
forward and under until it assumes per
manent deformity, productive of constipa
tion with all its attendant ills. Or we "sit
upon our stomachs," our limp backs per
mitting the body to double forward until
most of its weight rests upon that organ.
Our modern chairs are responsible for
modern shortcomings in this regard.
Cushioned seats with springs do not afford
the even, firm support that the body
needs. They give way unevenly, throw
ing undue weight and strain upon one
side or the other. A cushion in a chair
should never be a pan of its upholstery.
Itshould be soit, adjustable and yielding,
a thing to be tucked about where support
is needed, rather than a fixture. Our
chairs are, moreover, too high for women's
use, possibly for fcbe reason that they are
made by men, and in accordance with
masculine ideas of comfort as to height
and inclination. Clotnes-press hooks are
usually too high, for this same reason. A
cliair in which the body really rests should
be low enough so that when the feet are
resting comfortably on the floof the knees
are bent at an angle that gives a gentle
backward slope to the lap. Sitting thus
the body inclines slightly forward in the
position that take 3 the most pressure ofi
| the spine, and the big pelvic bones, so ad
â  mirably adapted for that purpose, sustain
j the weight. The seat should be of suffi
cient depth to support the body with no
strain upon any set of muscles. It is not
natural to sit upright, after tne manner
practiced by our grandmothers. The
strain upon the abdominal muscles in a
chair of ordinary height is too great when
the spine is erect, and the average
woman almost 'inconsciously crosses her
knees in order to felieve it.
Another "trifle light as air" that yet
produces harmful results is the almost
universal feminine trick of cutting thread
witn the teeth. Generally speaking, all
women sew, and perhaps one in a thou
sand in threading herneedle cuts or breaks
her thread with some other instrument
than her teeth. Because of its keen edge
the "eye" tooth is used for this purpose,
for which reason it is almost invariably the
first to require the dentist's services when
the teeth begin to need attention. Not
even the wooden toothpick or the more
primitive and universal pin does more
mischief to teeth than does this apparently
innocent practice.
Most women have a dread of growing
old, and the first wrinkle is generally rec
ognized with a pang. It usually comes at
the angle of the neck and jawbone, but is
generally followed, very quickly, by a
series of little fine lines between the eyes,
if no other warning is given the first ap
pearance of these little lines will be taken
by the wise woman as a signal to use eye
glasses in reading. When this is done
promptly the incipient wrinkles will t>rob
ably disappear. So very trifling do these
little matters seem as to be almost un
worthy of consideration, yet so far-reach
ing are even small effects that it might
almost be said there are no such things as {

ONGE HE HAD
MONEY JO BURN
|JoW Gaptain James Collins Asks
for a Free License to Run
a Fruitstand
A few days ago an aged man of stalwart
form appeared before the License Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors and re
quested the favor of a free license. He
was well known to every member of the
committee and they were stricken with
surprise at the unusual appeal.
The applicant was Captain James W.
Collins, a pioneer and resident of this
State since 1855, during which time many
fortunes have slipped through his hands.
He raised a family, all of wboni have
grown to mature years and are scattere i
abroad. The loss of his wife has feft him
solitary and alone in hiÃ old age. Though
crippled from accidents in early Hie, the
form of the captain is as straight as tnat
of the proverbial Indian, and the dark
tinge of his complexion is not unlike that
of the noble red man.
"Gentlemen,'' he said to the committee,
"I never thought of being compelled to
ask such a favor from my friends as! now
propose to do. I have fought the fight as
bravely as I could, but time bas proven
the winner, and now I am alone and with
out money in my declining years. My
wants are simple. I must make a living,
but I have not the money with which to
purchase a license to begin business. I
want a license to conduct a little fruit
stand at the southwest corner of Mission
and Sixth streets."
That was all. The request of the cap
tain was readily granted, and the stand
was opened on the outer edge of the side-
I walk at the corner mentioned several days
ago. There he holds levees daily with his
numerous friends, who walk blocks out of
their way to purchase a nickel's worth of
peaches, Dears or apples from the old man.
Captain Collins was a stage-driver in his
j time, and yesterday, in a reminiscent
mood, he recalled some interesting inci
dents of his staging days.
"I guess I've been hung up as often as
any stage-driver tliat ever pulled the
strings over six animals," he remarked.
Encouraged by his small audience the
captain continued:
"Yes, that's a fact, but the fellows that
stood me up were generally high-toned
boysâ not the lone-highwayman classâ
because it took more than one to stand me
up in those days, and I had no shotgun
messenger, either."
"Who was the most distinguished
gentleman of the road who ever ordered
â  you to throw out the box?" was asked of
the captain.
"Well, as I said, there were many of
them, but I presume that Vasquez really
took the cake. It happened in Pacheco
Pass, on the Visalia route. It was shortly
after the noon hour, and I bad a fresh
team. Not that the team being fresh cut
any figure in the matter whatever, but it
happened just after the regular change of
the hor.-es.
"When I swung into the road around
the bend on the up grade I saw three
mounted and two unmounted men lined
up alongside the thoroughfare, and I
knew just what it was. I was personally
j acquainted with Vasquez, and I knew it
was he and his gang. There were two
lady passengers, a small boy and an old
gentleman in the coach, but there was not
a dollar in Adams' express box. That
was before Wells-Fargo's time. The men
were all masked by bandana handker
chiefs, and Vanquez, the leader, held up
his pistol and ordered me to stoD, when I
got opposite. You can gamble that I took
no chances with that outfit, seeing the
load I had and no money to lose, so I hove
! down the brake and set ray team almost
on their haunches with a jerk.
"'Good afternoon, Mr. Vasquez,' says I.
'How's business in your line? '
" 'D dull, Jeern,' he says, taking off
his mask. 'I will try to do a little busi
i ness with you, though. Throw out the
box.'
â¢â¢ 'There ain't a nickel in it, Mr. Vas
quez,' says I, handing the box to him,
which he shook for a rattle. When be
found that there was nothing in it he let
out a stri.ig of Spanish oaths, tossed it
back, commanded me to drive ahead and
upon pain of death not to report him
until I got to the end of my journey.
This command I obeyed strictly. No
j damage was done further than the faint
ing of one of the women.
"I got into trouble in the later sixtie s
with Mason and Henry, the two noted
highwaymen, and through the innucence
of Attorney Brooks of Visalia got sus
pended. These men were being closely
pursued by officers and really had no
chance to get food for themselves. I took
them things to eat in order to keep them
from robbing the stage. Mr. Brooks saw
me pass out provisions to the men be
tween Firebaughs Ferry and Elknorn,
j and reported the matter, which led to my
suspension. The men were soon after
ward caught m the Sugar Loaf. Fifteen
times aside from this I have been hung
{up on the road. In fact my horses got so
j used to it that they would stop on seeing
a man beside the road with a pistol or
shotgun."
From stage-driving the captain went to
mining, where he piled up a fortane of
$500,000. Later he became a dairyman,
being the owner of the well-known Bel
mont dairy, which supplied the city insti
tutions with milk for many years. His
fortune gradually waned, until now the
gallant old man is driven tÂ« selling
fruits, with a free "license, on a street cor
ner, as stated above.
Yet he is happy in telling about driving
the first stage to Gilroy Hot Springs and
of making $100,000 in an hour once.
Still Or\e Use
For Gobble Storves
Just below the eastside crossing of the
intersection of Montgomery and Commer
cial streets there is a cobbled area of street
paving which has passed through succes
sive gradations of deterioration until
finally it has reached the sta.e of ruin.
Drays have pounded away at the cobbles
until some have split and others have be
come loosened from their setting in sand,
which may have been at that place soon
after the tide had ceased to run up to
Montgomery street, and possibly about
the period when that stout vessel, the
famous Niantic, sank at the present corner
of Clay and Sansome streets. But even a
rained pavement has its uses for the in
genious small boys of San Francisco. 8o
it happened yesterday morning that the
basaltic baubles, which were, erstwhile,
thunder-provoking pavements, were in
process of collection by three very small
children of the streets, who shouted " 'Rah,
'rah, 'rah !' : and the rest of the University
of California yell, which had been picked
up by the precocious youngsters on the
outskirts of a surreptitiously enjoyed foot
ball game.
'"Rah, 'rah, 'rah," they sang and gath
ered up great cobbles into lheir cloth caps,
one big stone for each small boy.
"Here, what are you up to?" demanded
a passer.
No answer.
"I'll give you a nickel if you will tell
me what you are going to do with those
cobbles."
"Gimme the nickel first."
The coin of the realm was produced and
when grimy fingers had clutched it the
leader of the lads said with a sudden and
strange shyness and diffidence: "We are
going to play house with them."
That is the way children along the
country lanes of New England "maKe
houses ' under the shady trees; "houses "
the memories of the lost associations 'of
which cause wealthy occupants of man
sions to drop furtive tears as the familiar
scenes of childhood are revisited in later
years, and other children are found to be
building other houses on the old spot.
The largest oak tree now standing in
Great Britain is that known as the "eow
thorpe." It is seventy-eight feet in cir
cumference at the ground and about 146
feet high.

a request that he should furnish a text to
be inscribed upon greenbacks. The sturdy
politician thought a moment and sug
gested, "Silver and gold have I none, but
such as I have give I thee."
Now there is something particularly
solid and satisfying in a pat scriptural
quotation or simile. An American audi
ence is easily affected by one. That this
is so is evidenced by the cross of gold and
crown of thorns figure of speech intro
duced with telling effect at the Chicago
convention by Mr. William Jennings
Bryan. As a matter of fact this waa not,
strictly speaking, a quotation from the
Testament, but it sounded biblical, and
there are those who go so far as to assert
that it was these few words that se
cured the Presidential nomination for the
speaker.
The every-day reader of newspapers who
takes an interest in political and financial
matters, by following the injunction of
John to -'search the Scriptures," may find
much in their pages that is appropriate to
present-day conditions. The eood Repub
lican may here find text and verse which,
in his opinion, justify his convictions.
The Democrat, too, may light upon a trite
observation which will afford him con
firmation of his ideas. But it is the man
on the fenceâ the person without settled
convictions one way or another â who
really enjoys the view. Each of the others
may make a point of studiously ignoring
"the other fellow," bnt he sees both side?.
Taking a retrospective glance at recent
events, we can imagine David Bennett
Hill, for instance, citing Scripture to con
found his opponents in the Democratic
camp. We can hear him calling to his
followers, "Receive my instruction, and
not silver" (Proverbs viii:lo), or urging,
"Merchandise of wisdom is better than of
silver" (Proverbs iii:l4). And when the
plaudits of the assembled populace sound
ed in his ears, announcing the Nebraska
orator's election, we can hear his mut
tered words of explanation, that it all
happened "because they sold the righteous
for silver" (Amos ii:6).
And there is the Democratic nominee
himself. Had he searched the Scriptures
in the hour of his triumph he might well
have ejaculated with Jeremiah, "How is
the gold become diml" or with Isaiah
(xiv:4), "How hath the exactress of gold
ceased !" Or he might, in referring to tne
yellow metal element, complain with the
prophet, "They lavish gold . . . and
weigh silver" (Isaiah xlvi:6).
And now come the people of the United
States and complaining against the de
fendants, the present administration,
they say with Nehemiah, "We have bor
rowed money" (Nehemiah v:4). They
affirm with the apostle, "The people cast
money into the treasury" (M&rk xii:4l),
and, with words significant to Mr. Car
lisle, "Remember my bonds" (Colossians
iv:18.
Step up, Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan. Intro
duce yourself and give us your opinion on
the last issue by Grover Cleveland. Says
the representative of Lombard street, "I
am an emDassador in bonds" (Ephesians
vi:2o). "And regarding the last issue of
bonds?" we ask. "More to be desired are
they than gold, yea, than much fine
gold," promptly quotet Morgan from
Psalm xix.
"Money answers all things," says tht
j Preacher (Ecclesiastes x:19). United
I States bonds are money, ergo. United
States bonds have the power of speech.
Like Balaam's ass, their periods of elo
quence are few and far between. To the
British banker they lift up their voice.
''We were not redeemed with silver and
gold," say they, and with the prophet
urge: "Take the spoil of silver and the
spoil of gold." (Nahum ii:9.) But England
will have none of the twin-metal scheme
of payment. "I have made gold my
hope," insists the creditor, sternly and
successfully.
The California delegates to the Popu
list convention went to St. Louis in
cars absolutely Spartan-like in their sim
plicity. No Pullman coaches were there
to accommodate the reDresentatives of
the People's party. In fact, "They took
no money in their purse" (Luke ix:3.)
We can imagine the contempt felt by these
sturdy middle-of-the-roaders toward their
luxury-loving fellows. With Isaiah we
can hear them exclaim, "Wherefore spend
ye money?"
By wav of suggestion to stamp speakers
during the coming campaign, we append
a few mottoes from the Scriptures which
may be useful to round out political ad
dresses. The reader, be he Republican,
Democrat or Populist, can take his choice
of them. Who can say but that they may
be efficacious in securing fat Government
positions for those using them ? This one
thing is certain, that they are more
authentic than the platitudes which are
reported to have made a Presidential nom

At various times during the existence
of the Roman empire loyal subjects wore
in their rings portraits of the reigning Em
peror.Dorothy Dee was a dear little girl.
With shining blue eyes and hair all a-curl;
Lipe always *miiiug, knew never a pout,
But now all these statements must be turned
round about.
Shining blue eyes with big tears are wet,
Borne dreadful thing must have happened our
pet;
Lips all a quiver with grief and woe,
What a shame a wee girlie such trouble should
know.
Very much troubled was Dorothy Dee,
Just as unhappy as ever could be;
Her lovely new dolly, her sailor boy Jack,
Fell to the sidewalk with oh such a whack.
And his head all in pieces was lying around,
Some on the sidewalk and some on the ground ;
Even Aunt Lizzie, so very well skilled
In the mending of do. ls, was sure Jack was
killed.
Without anj doubt the dollie was dead.
Why a doll couldn't live without any head;
Never mind, said her grandma, don't cry any
more,
A new head will make him as good as before.
But, O, my grandma, said Dorothy Dee,
A sweeter child there could not be,
You can make my dolly all mended and new,
But my poor little heart is broken too.
Next day, with her face all shining with joy,
She clasped m her arm%a new sailor boy.
And we know that wi?h us you are sure to
agree,
Grandma found a new heart for Dorothy Dee.

When boys and girls nowadays have
anything to say to their friends who are
far away they sit down and write a letter
in plain English, French or German, as
the case may be; but before you are able
to write you have to learn how to make
some twenty-six letters and how to com
bine them into words, so as to tell your
friends what you are thinking about. This
is called sound writing.
Now there is another kind of writing â
picture writing it is called â in which there
is no alphabet, and instead of words some
picture of the object is used, as, for ex
anrfple, instead of the word c-a-t we would
have a drawing of the animal.
This kind of writing was used by all
people in the early days of the world, and
in most countries it is so old that it has
loug ago been forgotten, but here in
America the Indians have practiced this
old art until very recently.
Not long ago 1 saw a photographic
account of Cluster's famous fight on the
Little Big Horn. It was drawn by Red
Horse, a Sioux chief, who took no small
part in that fearfnl battle. A queer and
curious record it seemed to me, but the
Indian read it with as much freedom a- 1
could have read the newspaper story.
The following letter, written by an i
dian girl to a friend whom she wished ,
visit her, will give yon a very good idea ol
this kind of writing, which, it is likely,
your own ancestors used thousands oi
years ago.
This will not seem very plain to you, I
know, but the one who received it under
stood it just as weli as the letter you write
to your friendsâ perhaps a little better.
Tbe straight lines running through the
picture represent the paths of the locality â
public highways or streets you may call
them if you like. On the right are shown
three small lakes or ponds.
The rudely drawn bear in the upper
left-hand corner is the signature oi the
â writer, her coat-of-arms, so to speak, and
indicates that she is a member of the
bear family.
The figure of a mullet below stands for
the person addressed â a man of the mul
let family.
The three crosses are the girl and two
friends â crosses because they are Chris-
The two triangles indicate the wigwams,
and the figure in the one is the Indian
si^n for hand and tells the visitor at which
m icwam he is to call.
In a little more elesrant English the in
vitation would read : Miss Bear invites Mr.
Mullet to meet her two Christian friends

China has sometimes been called "the
land of opposites. " The name seems to
be well applied, in so many ways are Chi
nese customs precisely contrary to those
of the rest of the world. We blacken our
shoes; the Chinaman whitens his. We
shake hands with each other; he shakes
hands with himself. We uncover the
head as a mark of respect; he keeps his
head covered, and if be wishes to appear
extraordinarily polite takes off his shoes.
In China it is the old people, not the
young, who fly kites, play marbles, walk
on stilts and let off firecrackers. We live,
cook and eat on the lower floors of our
houses and sleep upstairs; the Celestials
generally do the opposite. In dating let

first. Black is our badge of mourning;
white is theirs. We pay our doctors when

Boys and girls who planted trees on last
Arbor day and have since watched them
grow will be glad to learn that there is a
strong sentiment, favored and encouraged
by the Agricultural Department of the
United States Government, for the ob
servancÂ« in the public schools of the
country of one day as "Bird day" as
Arbor day is now observed.
The little feathered songsters of our for
ests and fields offer deiientful opportuni
ties for study and observation, and it is too
bad that so many wide-awake American
boys and girls do not know more about
ttiem. But tbe idea of the advocates of
the day is partly a practical one; as Arbor
day seeks to preserve our forests, so Bird
day will seek to preserve the lives of the
little denizens of the forest.
It wiil so interest the boys in the ways
of the birds that they will never again
throw a stone or let fly a bullet at one of
the innocent creatures, and so touch the
hearts of the girls tnat not one of them
will ever wear a bird's feather on her hat.
And that would be a very good thing,
wouldn't it, if "bira day" did nothing
more than that?

Oh, vacation time is almost done,
And the days go flitting by,
From hpnng and mountain the children come
From play 'neatu a summer sky.
With sparkling eye and ruddy cheek,
Kissed brown by a summer sun,
The children all come trooping home
For work must be begun.
They've wandered o'er the fields and woods,
They've played in mossy nooks,
Ani learned sweet lessons of Nature's life
.They'd never learn from books.
But lessons and tasks are here once more,
And schooldays have begun,
Then to work, to work, with merry hearts,
For the year will soon be run.
For the years are fleet, my children dear.
And tbe days go flitting by,
And again will come vacation timo
And play 'neath a summer sky.

Dr. Gerhard Rohlf?, one of the pioneer
explorers of Africa, died recently in Ger
many. He was a rather curious char
acter. Half soldier and half scientist, he
was excellently fitted for the difficulties
be encountered in his journeys. Born in
'1831, he enlisted as a soldier at 18, ad
vancing to the rank of an officer before
he graduated from college. He after
ward studied medicine, and in 1855 en
listed as a military surgeon in the French
army, going through the campaign of
Algiers in that year. Africa interested
him very much and an uncontrollable de-
lire prompted him to penetrate to the in
Â«rior of the "dark continent." All alone,
lisguised as a Mussulman pilgrim, he
crossed the Sahara through its entire
ength on foot, a journey w hich took him
wo and a half years. In 1864 be started
jpon an exploring trip through tbe snow
:overed range of the Atlas Mountains. He
horoughly acquired the languages of the
countries he traveled through and trans
lated into German some very valua
ble Arabian manuscripts and acquaint
ed science with an immense terri-
Tory which before him no Euro
pean had ever seen. In 1868 Rohifs
went with the English army to Abyssinia,
and in 1869 he undertook to bring the pres
ents of the King of Prussia to the Sultan
of Bornou. He fell sick on this journey
and transferred the gifts of the King of
Prussia to Dr. Nachtigal, who has since
achieved for himself a reputation as an Af
rican traveler. Later on he took part in
an expedition through the Lybian Desert
and several other minor scientific expedi
tions. He was appointed German Consul-
General at Zanzibar, but recently sickness
compelled him to seek his fatherland.
Roblfs deserves great credit for his work
in the interest of African explorine, and
his descriptions of his journeys are full of
life and interesting detail. He was a very
quiet man, and no one would have sus
pected in him one of the modern heroes of
scien cc.

A BOY'S
ADVENTURE.
Ir\ Which J-ie Flees From Orve
Danger to Rush Irxto Another.
BY CHRISTIANA ROSS FRAME IN THE PHILADEL-
PHIA TIMES.
\Continnrd from last Sunday. \
It was a much longer distance than it
looked, out to the flat where the pools
were, but I kept on, quite forsettins
about the "little way" I had intended go
ing.
When I reached the channel I found
that it was too broad and deep for me to
attempt ciossine. I heard Mac say there
was but one place where it could be forded,
and I skirted up and down looking for the
spot. Bo intent was I that I had not heard
the far-away murmur of the approaching
tide. Suddenly a long, hollow roar
sounded up the channel; tbo air was
fiik'd with it, and the very ground seemed
to tremb.'e. I knew that there was not an
instant to lose; the tide was almost
upon me.
Tbe black clouds overhanging the bay
had fallen lower; a thuuderstorm was
coming with the tide. Fear lent wings to
my heels. I turned and fairly flew for the
shore. Once I stumbled into quicksand,
and with difficulty wrenched myself out.
But I was no match for the tide. I dared
not look behind, but Dy the deafening roar
I knew that it must be very near.
Just at that instant a great foam-tipped
wave, the advance guard, swept round,
carrying me in its onward course like a
straw upon the surface. Panting and
struggling, I gained the foot of the cliffs,
and, dripping and terrified, gazed blankly
at the sheer height. Fortunately a little
cleft, up which it was possible to climb,
was near. The tide was now beating
against ihe foot of the cliffs, and as I
drapged my torn and bleeding feet up to
the back pasture toward the great icaple
in the center, with a ferocious roar the
bull came charging towards me.
The tree was my only refuse, and by
clinging desperately with hands and feet,
I reached a position of safety, just as the
savage animal came panting and roaring
underneath. Round and round the tree
he circled, tearing up the earth with his
hoofs, and snorting with baffled rage. At
every movement of mine, nis wicked red
eves were turned upward. His muzzle
was covered with foam, and now and then
a short, sharp yap, like that of an angry
dog, sent a feeling of sickening tsrror over
me.
I had heard Uncle John telling father
that the farmer in Clifton from whom lie
had purchased the bull bad been obliged
to shoot a number of cattle suffering .rom
hydrophobia on his farm. A mad dog
bad been loose in the district, and there
was a general feeling of uneasiness among
the Clifton farmers in regard to all cattle
that had been in open pasture at the time
of the dog's visit. Mr. Yuill had written
to uncle to keep a sharp watch over the
bull. Uncle had at that time a^ain warned
me not to go near the pasture.
The hours of the afternoon crept slowly
away ; the shower had been very slight,
and the sun came out again hot and
bright. From my perch I could see the
roof of our house above the orchard trees.
When smoke came curling up from the
chimney I knew it was 5 o'clock and that
Sara was bustling around preparing tea. I
had seen Aunt Maria making chicken
salad and other delicacies in the forenoon,
preparatory to having company that even
ing. The hungrier l got the more vividly
did tbe tea-table stand forth in my mind's
eye. Once I almost risked getting down,
hut in an instant the bull stood waiting,
and I crept back.
The sun went down behind the Cobe
quid Mountains. Away on the distant
marshes, where the men looked like bes
movine back and forth, the twilight
shadows were failing. The heavy hay
wagons passed slowly round the dike and
disappeared behind the niil. It was milk
ing time now, and as I thought of the
humming sound of the milk on the bot
tom of tbe pails and then of the frotii
covered fullness I grew thirstier and
hungrier.
The summer evening was very still; no
wind rustled the trees; a lost lamb bleated
mournfully in an adjoining pasture. The
air was filled with midsummer odors â
new-mown hay, wild roses, and. the pecu
liar green summery smell of the rushes
by the brookside. Then the stars came
peeping out. By this time I must be
missed at home. I knew that Inquiries
would be made at neighboring houses be
COASING.
Little boy and girl, do you ever coast
Down hill on your bikes like me,
While the breezes swift they almost lift
You off as they rush so free?
1 start at the top of the highest hill,
And then, like the wind, with glee
: I sweep right down from the mountain'

Till I come to the edge of the sea.

For it's fun you'll all agree-
But you'd better not try that plan, for I

fore any search was started on the farm.
Cold, dampness and hunger caused me to
become very drowsy, but I tried in every
way to keep from falling asleep, fearful
of losing my hold or of missing any one
that might come near the pasture in search
of me.
By and by lights appeared on the
marsh, lanterns moving here and there,
following apparently the line of the creek
and bay. Tbey must have found my
shoes and stockings on the dine and sup
posed that I was lost in the tide.
All night long I sat in the tree, shifting
I my position now and then as I became
| cramped. All night long my guardian
I stood underneatn, alert on my slightest
; movement. The damp, chill air of early
morning set my teeth chattering, and my
benumbed limbs were almost unable to
keep their place.
Then came the glorious sunrise, and the
i awakening of bird and beast. With loud
j cJamorings the crows flew over my head
ion their way to the beach in search of
j their morning repast of clams. Mush-
I rooms glittered like little knobs of silver
. in the dewy grass. Away in the distance
men were still moving to and fro by the
j marsh bank.
Taking off ray light blonse, I hunt; it
j out on the tree, in the hope that some
keen eye might see the signal. Then I
crept cautiously back into my former safe
position beside the trunk; hunger and
sleeplessness had made me so giddy that I
dared not look down, but I knew that the
mad creature with red eyes and boiling
tongue was watching my every move
j ment.
Oh, that the men would leave the dike
i and make search of the upland! Again
and again I shouted, but the only answer
was tne echo of my own hoarse voice.
Suddenly the bull began eagerly snuffing
tbe air, then with a snort of rage be
started off to the opposite side of the field
and furiously charged against the fence.
A howl of terror came from ftbf ad-
I joining pasture. From my perch I could
see Robin, the choreboy, flying with
outstretched arms toward home. With
\ all my strength I shouted his name. Ha
stopped and looked wildly round in every
direction, but not seeing whence the voice
came he turned and fled. I felt sure that
when his story had been related, speedy
relief would come, and it was in an incred
ibly short space of time that a large party
I of farmhands, headed by father with his
rifle, came hurrying into view.
Their appearance seemed to lash the
bull into a frenzy of rage. His howls
were terrifying, but a well-aimed ballet
laid hjm dead beside the fence.
It is needless to describe their delight,
or mine, over tne fortunate ending of sucn
a night of anxiety. My shoes and stock
ings had been found on the dine, and
these, with my tracks on the beach, had
led to the belief that 1 had been caught in
the tide and drowned. The creek and
marsh had been carefully searched in the
hope of finding my body. The weary
searchers were breakfasting, when Robin
burst into the kitchen with nis incoherent
story. All started up and uncle, knowing
tbe calamity he feared had befallen the
bull, called to father to fetch his rifle.
This is the first day that I have been
outside since my adventure. Lying here,
in the sunny calm and security of the
farmhouse garden, it seems almost impos
sible that such events could have hap
pened, but wiien I move my weakness and
my stiff limbs recall my narrow escape
from death, and I mentally register a vow
for future obedience.

THE SUPERB PARISIAN CREATIONS WORN BY THE PRINCESS MAUD
But few Princesses have had so satis
factory a trousseau as the Princess Maud,
and this is largely owing to the fact that
she is a young woman gifted with an
unusual amount of taste, individually,
and that very necessary possession, lmae
ination. Naturally her Highness' wed
ding dress and the costume she went away
in were made in London, but very
numerous were the frocks ordered in
Paris, and for many years the Princess
of Wales has had most of her gar
ments made in the French capital.
As some of my readers may like one of
these days to patronize the dressmaker oi
the Princess of Wales, who has certainly
marvelous taste, let me tell them that
Mme. Froruent, rue de la Paix, designs
many of her handsomest gowns. As her
Highness is at present wearing second
mourning, she has recently received sev
eral in shades of mauve. One is a lilac
mousseiine de soie, over silk of
the same shade, trimmed with cream lace
and silver embroidery, the bodice being
slightly open, but not cut low, a sort of
demi-toilette. Another suggests charm
ing possibilities. It is of pearl-gray bilk
muslin, over moire of the same tint
Beautiful embroidery on white satin rib
bon in black and steel spangles is used
as band, collar, etc. Many more cos
tumes from this excellent woman might
be mentioned, but before taking
l<>ave of Mme. Froment, let me tell
you that all these dresses have the
skirts made extremely plain, all ornamen
tation being on the bodices, and it is to be
noticed that their materials are no longer
lined with silk, but worn separately over
what in days long past was called a silk
slip.
But to return to the wedding. On
that occasion the mother of the bride
wore a toilette of pearl-white satin, veiled
in glittering tulle, which suited her ad
mirably.
The royal bride wisely decided not to
have too great a number of gowns, well
knowing how rapidly styles change, caus
ing the most exquisite of creations to be
come de mode within three months at the
most. All her frocks, without exception,
have plain gored skirts without eodets,
there being no fullness whatever at the
waist One much admired has a white
satin skirt and a low bodice covered with
silk muslin, embroidered with soft raised
Louis Seize bows in white silk and silver
thread, with a good-sized pearl io the cen
ter of each.
The sleeves are all frills of snowy white
cniffon, and over the berthe is turned a
veiling of black tulle, sprinkled with dia
monds; and the deep folded black is not
merely outlined with diamondsâ it is
simply covered with them.
A primrose satin toilet is draped with
pale green net with bunches of small
silver berries on it, and the drapery is
drawn into a deep satin waistband. The
skirt is cut with a train and has a panel of
tbe silver- studded green net terminating
in a large bow at the edge. A dress of the
lovely material called "moire velours" in
pale blue is richly embroidered with
silver and turquoises, and the skirt is
cut in tabs tiiat allow a flounce of pale
blue chiffon to show itself. Still another
evening gown is of geranium pink silk, the
bodice draperies being wrought with sil
ver, pearls and coral, and finished by
bretelies of pale .rreen velvet A pretty
blue dress has white stripes and broche
white flowers and the bodice is gracefully
arranged with blue tulle and white lace.
From Paris was an exquisite evening
dress of the richest creamy-white peau de
soie, the skirt veiled with gauze, on which
lace flowers were laid. These flowers had
large, open centers, beautifully filled in
and embroidered with gold thread and
turquoises; the gauze skirt was finished
with a small flounce of point d'Angleterre,
and hung loosely over the rich silk under
skirt. The bodice was lovely, veiled with
this same gauze and lace flowers, and the
neck surrounded with large chrysanthe
mums, worked with turquoises and gold
of various shades; sleeves to match, and
waistband of two folds of velvet, one lemon
color and the other turquoise.
The Queen presented the bride with
four dress lengths of Irish poplin in the
very beautiful new weaves, which are and
will be all through next winter very
fashionable and equally expensive. Those
selected for the trousseau were of four dif
ferent shades â a handsome deep carnelian
red imperial poplin, a fine ribbed black,
a pale blue known as faience blue Fran
cais, and a shaded black and silver thick
ribbed poplin. A few yards of corn
colored fancy Irish poplin were selected
by the bride herself for a bodice. It
has narrow lines and a small black de
sign, and is made with a wide box pleat
in front with three buttons of fine cut jet
on it. Over the shoulders is a filmlike
arrangement of lace, and around the
throat and waist are soft bands of black
satin. A black brocbe skirt is to be worn
with it. So, after all there are numer
ous indications that as yet the black
skirt and fancy bodice have not
been done away, but they are frasse and
the most fashionable dressmaker so
thoroughly disapprove of tbe combina
ion, which is certainly disastrous for
many figures, especially for the short,
plump woman, to whom it imparts a short
and ilumpy appearance, if the skirt is
dark and the bodice light in color.

THE BRAZEN HEAD--HOW ROGER BACON INVOKE MYSTIC RITE
Roger Bacon, "the admirable doctor,"
born in Somersetshire, England, in 1214
and known as "the father of experimental
philosophy," was also a great student of
mysticism, writing several treatises on the
subject and making numerous practical
experiments. One of the experiments
ascribed to him, but under the name of
Friar Bacon, was the fabrication of a Talk
ing Head of bronze.
This is described in a book entitled
"The Famous Historic of Friar Bacon,
Conteyning the Wonderful Thinges That
Hee Did in His Life." According to this
authority Friar Bacon, in the seclusion of
his cell in a monastery, was "reading one
day of the many conquests of England
when he bethought himselfe how hee
might keepe it hereafter from like con
quests ana so make himselfe famous here
after to all posterities.
"This, after creat study, hee found
could be no way so well done as one,
which was to make a Head of brasse, and
if he could make this Head to speake, and
be are it when it speakes, then might hee
be able to wall all England about witn
brasse."
To this purpose he got Friar BunÂ«ey to
assist him. Bungty was a great scholar
and magician, but not to be compared
to Friar Bacon. These two, after great
study and pains, so framed a Head of
Beautiful Blouse Bodices Seen at San Francisco .Matineesâ Tlje Smart Sift of
Dressingâ J\ .New Lantern-Shaped Sfyade
The bridal robe was made of rich ivory satin, with a silvery sur~
face, woven in Spitaljields. The plain, long-trained skirt had a
chiffon ruche round the hem, in which a compact wreath of orange
blossoms, myrtle and white jessamine was laid, and there were chiffon
bows and trails of the bridal flowers on the left-hand side of the
train. The low bodice was of the satin in many folds, drawn up
toward the right side and leaving a clear space for the family and
other orders the bride is entitled to wear. The berthe finished with
chiffon folds and a trail of the white flowers, and at the back a
large, loosely tied chiffon bow with the flowers wreathed about it.
Redfern's Exquisite Gapes.
Redfern supplied all the Princess Maud's
tailor-built capes and gowns. Quite charm
ing is one costume of canvas, of a grayish
blue, exactly the tint of the old Wedg
wood china. It is lined with pale rose
China silk and has a short coat with large
pointed revers, faced with black satin and
edged with a navy-blue and black guimire.
The front is of white silk, with a pale
pink Chine design on it, and a folded band
of black satin encircles the waist. From
the same house was ordered a sample coat
and skirt of the handsomest navy blue
serge obtainable. The coat is a double
breasted reefer fastened with laree pearl
buttons. Jast such a dress would be a
welcome addition to any wardrobe.
Excellent are two Redfern capes. One of
fine black cloth is lined with old ruse
brocbe and trimmed with black silk
crochet passementerie, and the other is of
a fawn-colored cloth with a roll collar of
royal blue velvet. Fanciful tabs of the
same are introduced down the front and
all around the edge at intervals.
Truly fit for a princess is a deep, wide
and perfectly circular seal cape, which
contains six or seven complete and beau
tiful skins. It has a collar that will either
stand up or turn over of the most exquis
ite chinchilla. The lining is of black and
old-rose broche. No more becoming gar
ment could De devised, and very beautiful
is a carriage cloak of Simla cloth.
On the outside it is of a deep violet tint
and on the inside of a harmonious shade
of mauve. A wide band of beaver trims
it and forms a large collar. A most artistic
Celtic clasp of bronze fastens the cloak.
This trousseau abounds in useful and
be autiful garments for every possible oc
casion, and I cannot in the space allotted
me give but the yaguest ideas concerning
the perfection and care exercised in the
choice of even the most unimportant arti
cles, showing throughout the care exer
cised also by the Princess of
Wales, who is well known to
be one of the most perfectly dressed
women in Europe. For instance, she per
sonally selected some rarely exquisite
Honiton point lace handkerchiefs which!
have a distinctly natural design, aa on an
extremely fine background can be seen
roses and shamrocks, which are inter
mingled with groups and wreaths of
smaller flowers.
Some of tbe dressing gowns are not only
extremely comfortable, but very artistic
and dainty as well. One is of flannel just
about two shades darker than a Malmaison
carnation. It has the yoke and cuffs com-
D osed of very narrow tucks; cream white

were all the parts and organs in a human

far from perfection as before, for they

without which it was impossible that it
should speak. They read many books,
but not finding any clew to what they
Bought, tney concluded to raise a "spirit"
and to learn from him what they could not
gain by their own studies.
They prepared all things necessary, and
went out one evening to a wood near by
and after making use of many ceremonies
'â¢they spake the words of conjunction and
the devill straight obeyed and appeared to
them," asking what they would have.
"Know," said Friar Bacon, "that wee
have made an artificiall Head of brasse,
which we would have to speake, to the
furtherance of which wee have raised thee ;
and being raised, wee will keepe thee here,
unlesse thou tell to us the way and man

The "devill" told him that he had not
that power of himself.
"Beginner of lyes," quoth the Friar, "I

At this threat the "devill" relented and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
The Princess Maud's going-away costume was made of a pink
and gold glace silk with a plain skirt and ruche of Valenciennes lace
at the foot. There was a small embroidered and jetted Figaro jacket
and a full Jront of pinkish-mauve chiffon, elaborated by groups of
small tucks and narrow Valenciennes insertion between each group.
The sleeves had puffs at the top, but were closely gathered from
thence to the wrist, where there were ruffles of Valenciennes lace.
The double waistband was of pink and black satin ribbon fastening
under rosettes, and the throatlet was pink ribbon, with Valenciennes
rosettes on each side. A little cape to match.
Vandyke guipure trims it, and on the left
side hangs a smart little pocket covered
with guipure. It is attached to a pink
satin ribbon that terminates in a great ro
sette.
Another gown, also pink, is in a lighter
weight fabric through which runs narrow
stripes of white, and has a square collar
overlaid with a muslin one, and lace and
muslin cuffs, a smart liltle pocket, a
pinked-out flounce round the edge, and a
silk girdle and tassels.
Latest Calling QoWrvs.
For those who are expecting shortly to
select their gowns for calling, and for the
numerous teas to which they will be bid
den ere long, a brief description of three
of the visiting toilettes will not be without
interest:
"A Roman satin dress is of pale delicate
pink, and the back of the bodice is all in
one, though it has a well-fitted lining un
derneath.
This and the sleeves are crossed from
left to right with rather narrow black
Valenciennes insertion, put on aslant.
The collar is pink chiffon, and has little
Vandykes edged with narrow black Valen
ciennes turned down over it. There are
black lace ruffles at the wrists, and a black
satin waistband. A beautiful blaca broche
dress has a white satin bodice, overlaid
first by white silk muslin and then by
black silk muslin worked with fine jet and
a little steel.
The long sleeves are full at the top, and
in lieu of cuffs have long, tapering points
of wnite satin outlined with steel and
jet; the deep pointed band is embroidered
to correspond. A warmer dress is made
of mauve Venetian cloth with a most
beautifully hung skirt, and a velvet bodice
a shade darker, showing a mauve silk vest
embroidered all over with lace applique,
gold sequins and separate amethysts and
brilliants, and here and there a topaz, in
which the gold seemed reflected. On
either side of the velvet fronts are Tudor
rose medallions of mauve silk worked
with gold thread and jeweling; the velvet
waistband matches, and is secured by a
gold buckle on one side.
I was almost forgetting to tell you that
a perfectly new material made its debut
on Ascot Heath, viz. : a black moire, with
tbe watering in the opalescent green of a
duck's breast. It had a certain element of
tinsel introduced, which did not assert it
self, but served to brighten the whole ef
fectually. It was made up with trans
parent mousseiine de soie sleeves and
yoke, the latter liberally.embroidered with
jet and garnets.
the six hottest simples the Head should
have motion and in the space of one
month would speak, the time of the month
or day he knew not. Also he told them
that if they heard it not before it had
done speaking their labor should be lost.
They then permitted the "spirit" to de
part.
They prepared the simples and made
the fume and were inconstant attendance,
waiting for the Head to speak.
Thus they watched for three weeks
without any rest and they became
so weary and sleepy that they had
to seek respite from their watch. Then
Friar Bacon called his man Miles to watch
the Brazen Head and told him to wake
them if it spoke, else they would lose all
their labor and England would have a
great loss thereby. Miles promised to
faithfully obey his instructions. Then
Miles, to keep himself from sleeping, got a
tabor and pipe and made merry with
music. After some noise the Head spake
these two words, "Time is." Miles, hear
ing it sneak no more, thought his master
would be angry if he waked him for that
and, therefore, he let him sleep and began
to mock the Head:
"Thou brazen-faced Head, hath my
master tooke all t.ese paines about thee,
and now does thoa requite him with these
two words, Time is ? Had hee watched

leaving the wide frill with its scalloped
edge upstanding. Down each perpendicu
lar wire of the frame carry a full ruching
of lisse, add a ruche round the top of the
panels and another at the bottom. This
completes the shade.
I must not forget my promise to de
scribe the tailor-made bicycle suit and the
riding habit which naturally figure in the
trousseau of a princess so fond of all out
door exercises. The bicycle suit is of fine
fawn Venetian clotb. The skirt is just wide
enough for comfort, and has pleats at the
back that arrange themselves on either
side of the saddle when the rider mounts
her machine. It is lined all through with
silk serge, and has a most curious ar
rangement for windy weather, in
the shane of little bags along the
hem with flaps to buttom over. Tiny bags
of 3hot are inserted in these to prevent
the skirt from blowing out of place. The
single-breasted coat fits like a glove; it has
lapels and collar like a riding habit and
fastens with fancy brown and white but
tons. Holland lapels and cuffs are made
to nearly cover the cloth ones and are re
movable, and there is a close-fitting basque
and half-moon pockets.
Concerning the habits I quote: "A very
useful dark rough skirt, cut with all the
latest improvements, is perfectly safe, and
cannot in any way catch on to the saddle
in the event of the rider losing her seat.
The single-breasted coat bodice fits per
fectly, and has rather a long plain basque.
It fastens with three buttons, and

After half an hour had passed the Head
again spoke two words, "Time was."
Miles respected these words as little as
he did the former, and still did not wake
Friar hacon and his friend, but scoffea at
the Brazen Head ttiat it haa learned no
better wordf, with such a tutor as bis

But Friar Bacon did thee spoyle
When he tby sides did batter.
The maid of honor, Princess Victoria, wore
a dress of ivory-vrhite satin. The seams were
embroidered with trails of lilies of the valley
and their leaves in silver. The bodice was
draped with chiffon, the sleeves and berthe
being of rich lace. In her hair was worn an
aigrette, at the base of which was a knot of
scarlet geranium. Her bouquet was composed
of the same flowers, a small bunch of which
also appeared on the left side.
in a darker tone. The sleeves areas flat at
the shoulders as they can be made, and
there are several smart drill waitscoats,
plain and spotted. The hard felt riding
hats, black, gray and brown in color."
How really artistic and beautiful it must
have been and quite too costly to ever be
come ordinary. Equally charming in their
simplicity are the novelties in muslins
which show large white flowers scattered
over colored grounds; for instance, a china
blue silk has a white design of clematis.
Beautiful Blouses.
One lovely blouse bodice of crepe de
Chine is given the true French touch by
means of sleeves of black and white
striped glace; and a waistband of black
satin with a handsome rhinestone buckle
at each side. Three broken rows of lace
beautify the bodice and a deep frill of lace
falls over the hands. The high Medici
collar is of the striped silk completely
covered with lace.
Another of rosy taffeta has a breast
plate-like effect of applique lace and epau
lettes of the same and a transparent yoke
of mousseiine de soie. At the waist is an
odd arrangement of two wide taffeta rib
bons pale green in color, which encircle the
waist smoothly, but cross each other
quaintly in front; four handsome pink
enameled buttons flecked with gold, ap
parently, hold the ribbons in place.
Almost equally pretty is a third
blouse bodice composed of twine-hued lace
over yellow chiffon on a silk foundation
of the same tone. Moss-green velvet rib
bons form the collar, catch up the small
puffs which head the tight-fitting niched
sleeves, and a very wide ribbon finishes
the waist A full frill of lace falls over
the hands. Very ample is a blouse bodice
in black and white glace silk. It has
revers of black velvet over which fall some
exquisite lace which completely covers a
vest of white glace.
Three beautiful buttons appear on each
of the revers. Over the black velvet
choker falls a tiny collar of the lace. The
sleeves are close-fitting, with very small
puffs. They extend in pretty points over
the hands. This bodice is the creation of
a celebrated dressmaker, and has an inde
scribable air and style quite individual
and very chic.
A dre.-s of black broche has a low bodice
with black lisse berthe and the sleeves are
composed of jet embroidery and shoulder
straps. A white satin sash is tied behind
in a large bow.
Only 116 divorces have been granted in

"Time was! I know that, brazen-face,

Thus Miles talked and sang till another
half hour was gone. Then the Brazen
Head spoke again these words, "Time is
part," and fell to the ground. Then fol
lowed a terrible noise, with strange flashes
of lire, so that Miles was half dead with
fear. At the noise the two Friars awoke,
and wondered to see the room full of
smoke, but when that vanished they per
ceivea the Brazen Head lying broken on
the ground. At this sight they grieved,
and called on Miles for explanation.
Miles, half dead with fear, said it fell

it did not speak.

Black silk moussehne de soie was draped over

Fashions for JAzr\.
On Derby Day the Prince of Wales ap
peared in a lounge suit. Needless to
say, this style has been quickly followed
in America, as in warm weather a frock
coat and top hat are far from comfortable,
and it is a relief to know that until the fall
we will not be expected to don them if not
guests at a wedding.
In England the four-in-hand tie is uni
versally worn, but in this country the club
tie and simple bow are preferred, and the
double-breasted waistcoat so generally i
worn in England is seen comparatively
seldom here. In London black seems to
be coming back and the four-in-bands are
all a somber hue, a natural reaction after
the gay colors so much indulged in of late.
Some of the most fashionable tailors are
giving the frock coats a slightly short
waisted effect the skirts are long, but
shorter than last year and are cut straight
and have not the absurd George IV ef
fect noted last season. Such coats are
double-breasted, have square shoulders
and peaked lapels with roll silk faced to
the button holes. The waistcoat worn
with it should have four buttons, and tbe
lapels must be well notched, and on all
occasions light gray trousers are worn.
Him's remarks concerning his servants
are worthy of consideration. He writes :
''I allow my servants â and I have kept
what is known as bachelor hall, and I
know of what I speak â liberty enough, but
I demand certain things of them. They
are told my conditions when they come
into my employ, and they must comply
with them or leave the place. I make
no concessions. Consequently, I am al
ways well served. My men servants must
always be spotless in attire, and I would
turn a man away at a moment's notice if
I found that he had even as much as a
spot on his shirt bosom. Consequently, I
nave excellent service, as I remarked be
fore. I always pay the very best wages.
"My men must be dressed also without
any ornaments whatever. It is very bad
form to allow a servant to wear jewelry,
and I would not let a groom wear a tie pin
âas I see some very rich but
very vulgar people permitâ in his white
lawn scarf. It must be perfectly plain,
like a hunt Ascot. If there are female
servants in the house they must, while at
my domicile, dress in black. The women
servants should only be allowed upstairs
or above the servants' hall at certain
times during the day, and this they
should understand. Of course, where there
is a hostess rules differ, but in any case
they should be made to know their duties
thoroughly. Nothing is more vulgar and
purpose. Ye have a parrot speake better

J^latir\ee Dresses.
The subject of matinees is an interesting
one, for all dainty women naturally wish
to look fresh and bewitching in the morn
ing. As a result many columns are
monthly devoted to the description of
these garments. But there is one serious
fault to be found with most such descrip
tions. I said all dainty women aspire to
be, etc., and but comparatively few can
afford the elaborate affairs, so pleasantly
written up, for most of them are of the
lightest and most delicate stuffs, all lined,
at best, with the best of lining, and tbe
greater number of them with silk, so it
naturally follows that after such a matinee
has been worn, say at the very most
twenty times (if the wearer is extraordin
arily careful) off it must go to the cleaner's,
and before it is sent it must be almost en
tirely ripped up. Well, we â most of vs â
know what that means, and simply cannot
afford such an outlay, and as wrappers
are never supposed to be seen outside of
the bedroom, what shall be done to at
tain the desired results? At the present
moment Japanese silks are selling for
almost nothing. I saw some a few weeks
ago which were quite lovely for 15 cents
per yard, and I straightway invested \n
twenty yards, thus expending $3; then,
as lace must be used as trimming, I se
lected a Valenciennes an inch wide. Thir
ty-six yards were sufficient, and that
meant $5 40. The silk has a white ground
with a little line of orange running
through it. I had a good grade of cotton,
which had been shrunk, used to line the
skirt, which is composed of three lace
edged ruffles. The long jacket is lined
with the same silk, tits tightly in the
back, but loosely in front, a fichu-like
arrangement having a lace-edged frill,
and has a pretty effect. The medium
sized sleeves have deep frills, lace edged,
that fall over the hand. I had used
orange ribbon, which gave a proper finish,
and altogether, this gown for the morn
ing cost but little over $12, and best of all
it can be sent to the French laundry, be
washed and ironed, and look just as fresh
and lovely as when it first came home
from a certain cheap little dressmaker's.
Two such matinees would last a long time,
and I have seen another made up very
like mine, but in a lavender and while
stripe, which is worthy of much praise, as
it was made at home, and in spite of this
fact, has a very Frenchy air, and this re
minds me that I have read that "a
matinee," or rather several matinees, are
the first purchase a French woman makes
when sht orders her trousseau, and this I
consider a good suggestion for our own
brides, as much comfort can be derived
from such garments.

Possibility TKat a Person's Thoughts May
Yet Be Photographed
Within the few months last past stu
dents of psychic science have been stimu
lated by the startling announcement that
the thoughts of an individual may be ren
dered visible through the mediumshlpof
photography.
Theosophy has always taught that
thoughts afe real, tangible tbines, visible
at all times to the one whose psychic de
velopment was sufficiently advanced.
Now comes the statement that it is not at
ali necessary that one should possess
"mediumistic" ability in order to visually
perceive the thoughts of another; and
that it is but an exceedingly simple matter
to secure a lasting image of the thought.
The announcement comes simulta
neously from France and lowa that
thought impressions have been success
fully photographed. Dr. Baraduc of Paris
has recently presented to thÂ« Academy of
Medicine a statement that he had obtained
photographs of thought impressions; and,
furthermore, thai he had "photographed
a soul." Just what tnfc pictures looked like,
or the mode of their production, is not
stated in the brief newspaper mention of
the event
Dr. Clarke of lowa announces a some
what similar achievement, which, while
not claiming to produce an image of an
actual thought, does present pictures
which are the direct result of brain force
exerted upon a photographic plate. The
Braingraph of an Inventor.
result of Dr. Clarke's experiments, al
though nut so astounding as those alleged
by Dr. Baraduc, are nevertheless more in
teresting, as the means employed are very
simple and are within the reach of many
among the readers of ThÂ« Call. They
are also fuiiy described.
As a matter of fact the subject of
thought photography has received a great
deal of attention among those scientific
men whose tastes led to the investigation
of the psychic side of life. The marvel
ous revelations of the X-ray, startling in
character as they are, pale to insignificance
beside the more marvelous disclosures
that pure science has in store for the com-
ing century. Already a few advanced stu
dents possess the knowledge of discoveries
of tbe most profound And vital impor
tance. Yet, the pnblicity of the informa
tion is withheld because of the opinions
entertained by the discoverers that the

time is not yet come for the presentation
of the matters.
One of the best known men of science,
whose name is of world-wide repute, is the
possessor of a discovery in physics that
would, if it were known, enable a nation
possessing it to lay the balance of the
world under servile tribute. In a conver
sation had last autumn, he said to me:
'I am not yet ready to make public the
results of my forty years of investigation.
No great discovery should be immaturely
Punched upon an unfitted public The
great things in nature rest upon simple
but mighty causes, that demand an intel
ligence immensely above the ordinary to
understand. Unfortunately, the majority
of the people comprising what we term
the 'public' are not only unthinking, they
are positively ignorant, and by their
ignorance totally unfitted to pass upon
matters requiring knowledge. Yet, when
some great truth is placed before these
untboughtfui people, they at once sit in
judgment and rush Into expressions of
opinion. The discoverer of the truth is
consigned to contemptuous obscurity, the
value of the truth is clouded, and its bene
ficent action retarded. The first is not
important, but the second â the retarda
tion of the truth's benefit â is a serious
matter. So I have concluded, wisely or
not, to wait and let the public acquire, lit
tle by little, some fragmentary knowledge,
so that when the discovery l have made
made shall be presented, people may be
able to accept understandingly, and profit
by the disclosure."
I am not prepared to say that he is
wrong.
The combined philosophy and study
culled science is rapidly arriving at the
conclusion that vibration is the universal
law; that every manifestation which our
senses are capable of contacting is a phase
of vibration, the different manifestations
being only differentiated modes of vibra
tory force. Light, sound, heat, cold, mag
netism, electricity are each but different
rates of vibration of the same primal sub
stance that, as yet, is wanting a
name.
As chemistry becomes better understood
the chemist is led to ask: Is there really
more than one element? Is it not the
fact tbat the different so-called "elements"
are but different forms of the sole, primal
element?
As between soul and body, or, if you
choose other terms, spirit and matter,
there is no difference save in vibration.
They are one and the same thing when
you come to the tiaal analysis. The one
is physical, the other psychical. Now if
we can produce a physical expression of
a psychic law we have demonstrated the
identity of the two.
Lay a coin upon the C string of a piano
and then with a violin or other musical
instrument sound the note C. Instantly
the coiu will jump from the piano-string.
Why did it jump? Because the piano
string vibrated. Why did it vibrate? Be
cause the law of sympathy forced it to do
so when you sounded the same musical
note a? the string was tuned to. Place
two metal wire 3 side by side, but carefully
insulated one from the other, and then
causa an electric current to flow over one
wire. Instantly an electric current ap
pears on the other wire. Why? Because
the law of sympathy called the second
current into being. In these two cases we
have a clear illustration of the physical
expression of a psychic law.
We know as yet but very little about
vibration, but enough to warrant the state
ment that it is the universal law. Sound
and light are now recognized as being vi
brations ofâ something. We are able to
mechanically demonstrate that sound is a
succession of vibrations, the highest sound
appreciable to the human ear being com
posed of 36,850 vibrations per second. The
next highest speed of vibration cognizant
to the senses of man is that of red light,
which is placed at 458 trillions vibrations
per second. There is a gap, a great gap.
between 36,850 and 458 trillions in the same
unit of time. These two manifestations
sound and light â are as yet the only ones
whose rates of vibration are known, but in
the light of the wondrous illumination
shed by scientific research during the past
few years it is not assuming too much to
say that the knowledge of other rates of
Vibration is within our grasp.
But a little while ago it was discovered
that if the brains of two indiviauals were
connected by a metallic conductor under
proper magnetic conditions, then the one
individual would become instantly cogni
zant of the thoughts of the other. The ap
paratus was an arrangement of wires con
nected to metallic bands which clasped
the heads of th 6 parties to the experiment,
a system of electro-magnets being intro
duced in the circuit of the wires. I say,
the one individual would become cogni
zant of the thoughts of the other. In
some cases this was actually so; in nearly
every case the one individual was cogni
zant of the emotions of the other, and it
Braingraph of a Lunatic.
was found that the human brain was
clearly cognizant of the feelings of anirer,
joy or fear excited in a dog^whose cranium
was encircled by one of the metal
bands.
What was the character of the "some
thing" transmitted over the wires? Who
is the savant who ehall demonstrate that
it is not a form of so-called electrical
energy?
Thought photography ia the physical
expression of a psychic law.
Through the kindness of Dr. Clarke, I
am permitted to lay before the readers of
The Call a description of the apparatus
employed by him, and also four photo
graphs, "braingraphs." taken by him,
showing the peculiar lines and figurations
of the brain force of four different in
dividuals. While tbese pictures'are in no
sense thought photosrraphs, they do much
to establish the claim that the terms
Braingraph of a Poetess.
"mind" and "matter" are but distinctions
without a difference.
The apparatus of Dr. Clarke consists of
an induction coil capable of producing an
exceedingly high-tension current. The
wires carrying the induction, or secondary
current, are connected by one terminal to
a metal plate held in position at the base
of the brain, and the other terminal, by
means of branching wires, to three metal
plates placed one over tho center of the
frontal bone and the other two placed on
opposite sides of the forehead, as shown
in the cut. A sensitive photographic plate
is placed between two sheets of silver foil
and inclosed in a plate holder, the wire of
the secondary circuit being led in through
the sides of the plate holder so that its ends
touch the silver foil on each side of the
sensitized plate. The apparatus is ad
justed upon the head of the subject, and
all electrical connections made before the
primary current is turned on. An ex
posure of a few seconds is sufficient. It is
found that all subjects are not good sub
jects. Another peculiarity of tbe process
points to the fact that terrestrial magnet
ism is in some way connected with th<j
phenomenon. The sansitiva plate must
be placed at right angles to the line of ter
restrial magnetic declination at the place
of operation. The experiment succeeds
best during dry weather; the presence of
moisture in the atmosphere exerts a de
terrent influence.
Naturally enough whenever an an
nouncement like that now made is laid
before the public there will be found two
classes of opinion. One will pooh-pooh
tbe matter and dismiss it from considera
tion without investigation, mainly because
of their inability to comprehend that there
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1896.
may exist anything not mentioned in
textbooks. The other will withhold judg
ment until the opportunity has been
afforded and availed of to make full and
complete examination of the whole
matter. It is the latter who by their labor
make useful each newly found power of
nature. There is no little diversity of
opinion as to the merits of phrenology.
By some it is held to be an exact science,
by others to be a vagary. By most men of
science it is believed that phrenology
possesses, in a general sense, some truths,
which, while falling far short of all the
claims put forth by the votaries of the
cult, do have some value in assisting the
determination of the general character of
the subject-individual.
The results of Dr. Clarke's investiga
tions seem to establish a fact: that it is
possible to learn by the means herein de
scribed something of helpful value in de
termining the character of a brain. This
is a great step forward on the road to in
tellectual progress. How many children
have been educated to trades and profes
sions for which they have proved unfitted ?
We are all familiar with examples of mis
placed education. The boy is sent to col
lege and large sums of money spent in the
attempt to make of him a lawyer or a
preacher, and the expense has proved
wasted, the labor a failure. It will now be
possible, with the development of the dis
covery made by Dr. Clarke, to ascertain
the natural brain force of the child and its
tendencies, and so be able to develop a
peculiar talent along natural lines; to
assist nature instead of thwarting her.
The braingraph must be of value in crimi
nal jurisprudence, as by its use the idiot
may be infallibly distinguished from the
responsible criminal.
In his letter to me Dr. Clarke states his
hopefulness in being able to produce the
braingraph without the presence of the
conducting wires. He expects to obtain a
braingraph of an individual without that
individual being cognizant of the opera
tion. If he is successful in this we may
look forward to a revolution in our opin
ions of individuals. The candidate for
public office will find that his cerebral
activities and mental predilections have
been infallibly pictured and any obliquity
disclosed. The employer "^vill take the
braingraph of the applicant fora confiden
tial clerkship, and the coming woman will
undoubtedly secure at the earliest moment
a braingraph of the coming man. .
FOOT - PROPELLED WAGON.
This last addition to the possessions of
science is but one of many discoveries
that have been made within the past few
years and which mavk the close of the
century as the richest period in history.
I Never, within so brief a time, has there I
come to the knowledge of the world so
many disclosures of the possibilities of
nature. We are rapidly reaching the
apex of intelligence, and it is possible
that within the liver of those now living
man will be able to determine in advance
the physical and mental status of his
progeny; will be able to huld converse
with his fellows at a distance without the
aid of wires or apparatus; will be able to
see his distant conversationalist, and not
be limited to the little globe we live upon,
but be able to reach out to other members
of the family of the Sun.

Natural Gas Failure.
The review of natural gas production in
the United States in 1895. made in ths re
port of the United States Geological Sur
vey, just issued, shows its value last year
to have been $13,006,650. as against $13 -
954,400 in 1894. The value of tbe natural
product consumed in 1895 was $7,920,187;
the total of pipe laid was 43,830,241 feetj
and the number of producing wells opened
3326. The most noticeable feature of the
year was the decreasing pressure in all of
the natural gas wells of the country. The
estimated life of the well 3 has also been
greatly reduced. The value of the con
sumption of natural gas in the United
States during the ien years from lSÃti to
j 1895 was greatest in 1888, when it was
j $242,129,875. From that time until 1891
the decrease was rapid, and in the past
four years there has been a gradual de
cline.
Experimenting With Car Wheels.
It is known that chilled cast iron wheels,
commonly used for freight cars, are liable
to be cracked from the heating of the
tread when a long-continued application
of the brake occurs, and several accidents
having occurred on heavy grades owing
to wheel failures, an experiment was sug
gested. The wheels to bs tested were
placed horizontally in a mold of sand with
an open space of a half inch or so around
tbe rim. Then molten metal was poured
into this space, heating the rim quite sud
denly, and of three wheels tried one
cracked in forty seconds, a second one in
two minutes, while the third wheel
showed no signs of failure. The latter
wheel was made at the Altoona shops, and
that it stood this test would seem to guar
antee it absolutely from ever giving out
on account of heating by brake friction.
As to the conditions secured in this ex
periment they must be considered to have
APPARATUS FOR MENTAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
been not a reproduction of the conditions
to be investigated but an exaggeration of
one of them. The heating by contact of
molten metal was more sudden than the
heatine by brake friction could be, and in
that respect the exaggeration may have
been preferable rather than otherwise;
while the other conditions which have to
do with the breaking of carwheels in use,
the severe and changing pressures and He
sudden shocks, were entirely absent. Ex
periments such as these, of course, have
their value and are to be encouraged, but
they should not be taken to prove too
much.
Electrolytic Welsbach Mantles.
A new and cheap process for the manu
facture of the incandescent mantles em
ployed in the Welsbach burner has been
patented in Germany. It consists in mix
ing with the nitrates or sulphates of the
earthy metals used the salts of their
bases, thus forming an electrolyte, through
which a current is passed into a skeleton
of fine-woven platinum wire, shaped like
a mantle. On this framework the metals
are electrolytically deposited and subse
quently calcined, after which the plati
num sKeletons are removed. Mantles
made in this manner are claimed to be
stronger than mantles made in the ordi
nary way, and further, the cost of manu
facture according to present methods ia
considerably reduced.
Electric Cloth Pressing.
In pressing woolen fabrics in order to
give them a smooth, fine appearance,
both a uniform pressure and a unitorra
heat are required. By a recently devel
oped system the heating is done electric
ally, the fabric being placed between the
metallic plates through which sufficient
current is passed while under hydraulic
pressure to heat them to slightly more
than the temperature of boiling water.
One dynamo of fifty volts and 700 amperes
will suffice tor five presses having 120 piles
to be heated ; the cost of heating for one
press for a period of half an hour and for
seventy plates is about 21 cents.
Foot-Propellei Wagon.
George G. J. Millar of Columbus, Ohio,
has invented a wagon intended to carry
several people and large loads, but capable
of being propelled by the foot power of
one person.
This end is accomplished by making
use of several well-known lever principles.
The operator sits In the rear of the wagon,
and by pressing his foot on a certain
lever causes another lever to rise and en
gage with a sort of cam. This produces
i fjreat power, so that the cam shaft is
I made to revolve. The power is then com
-1 municated to the axle of ths vehicle by
! cogwheels. The idea is that the great
power generated by the cam attachment
will cause the vehicle to run several feet
by the impetus thus. imparted. It will be
seen tbat the driving motion is not a
positive one, and of course the vehicle
would be a slow hill-climber, but on a
good road it should develop considerable
speed.
Cotton-Picking Machine.
A few years ago a committee of scien
tific men, after a conference, decided that
one of the gieat industrial needs of the
time was a cotton-pickinÂ« machine. They
further declared that there was a fortune
in store for the person who would irjvent
one. There have been numerous attempts
made in that direction, but all have been
failures for some reason.
Wbodbury K. Dana of Westbrook, Me.,
APPARATUS FOR HARVESTING COTTON.
has just patented a machine that is con
structed on the most simple but novel
principles, and, as far as can be judged,
from the theoretical construction of it,
ought to work. The principle made use
of is suction and the method of applying
it is the same as the pneumatic cash
carriers in use in 6tores all over the
country.
There are two parts to tbe machine,
mounted upon separate trucks. One truck
contains an engine and boiler and a centri
fugal airpump driven by same. The other
truck carries the picking machine, which is
connected to the air pump by a flexible
tube. The picking machine is nothing more
than a tank closed on all sides and with a
screen extending through a section of it a
few inches from the top. From different
sides of the tank hose pipes are attached
that have end pieces intended to fit over
the ball of growing cotton.
By setting the centrifugal pump in oper
ation the air is exhausted from the tank
and of course the air from the outside
rushes in through the hose pipes. It then
follows that if the end of 'the hose be
placed over the ball of growing cotton the
fiber will be torn loose and follow the air
into the tank.
The screen across the tank prevents the
cotton from passing into the pump.
Ffgbtin? From M dair.
A balloon which it is said, can be pro
pelled around a circle if necessary without
respect to the wind, has been devised by
A. R. Reed of Hot Springs, Ark. His de
vice has been submitted to some Cuban
sympathizers in this country, and it may.
be adopted in the war now raging on the
little island.
The gas bag is cigar-shaped. The usual
car or basket hangs underneath, and at
tached rigidly to the bottom of the car is
an air tube or magazine somewhat larger
than the basket, say thirty 01 thirty-six
inches in diameter. At one end is at
tached a rudder, to work partly inside and
partly outside of the tube. At the middle
of the tube there is a strong fan wheel,
similar to the electric fan?. This is
driven by a small gasoline engine of about
two horsepower, made of aluminum.
This engine goes in the basket immedi
ately over the circular fan, and the latter
is run by an ordinary belt running through
the bottom of the basket from the engine.
The rudder is managed by ropes. The
gas bag is covered with the usual rope net
ting to support the car and entire ma
chinery. The carrying machinery will de
pend entirely upon the size of the gas bag.
Inside of thirty days can be made a bal
loon which will carry 2000 pounds of dyna
mite in bombs and the necessary appa
ratus to fire them with precision, and with
this steering gear, the inventor says, he
can direct a balloon in any direction and
make it run around in a circle.
Production of Copper.
Acoording to the Engineering and Min
ing Jonrnal the production and export of
copper for tbe first six months of this year
makes a very satisfactory showing. The
total increase in the United States in pro
duction was 11,668 long tons, or 14.6 per
cent, and the increase of export, far in
excess of tbe increase of production,
amounted to 74.1 per cent On the 30th of
June the stocks in sight in England and
France were estimated at 30.729 tons and
the quantity from Chile 5550, making a
total of 36,279, as against 36,901 tons on
May 31. These figures show a decrease of
more than 600 tons during the month.
The decrease as compared with July 1,
1895. is 22.236 tons.
Telephoning: in the Rockies.
Telephone construction in the Rocky
Mountains is attended with a great deal of
hardship. The line built from Leadville to
Aspen several years ago is a case in point.
It took two months to cover the entire
length, forty-eight miles. In ordinary con
struction, the poles would ba set forty-two
to the mile, but at certain points, where
sharp turns weie necessary, the number
sometimes increased to seventy-five to the
mile. The members of the construction
gang had to be as expert as ax men as they
were as linemen, for when timber was en
countered a path of 200 feet on each side
of the line had to be cleared in order that
wires might not be broken when trees
were blown over by the terrific blasts
which at times prevail in that region.
A great deal of the comparative slowness
of the installation was owing to the inabil
ity of the workmen to labor in such a rare
ified atmosphere. At one point the wires
were strung at an elevation of 12,000 feet
above the level of the sea. In snch an alti
tude the lineman soon became completely
tired; after he has climbed two or three
poles he has to take a rest to recuperate
his energies. The preparation of tbe holes
for poles, which would have been tedious
in similar ground even in an ordinary at
mosphere, was an especially slow and fa
tiguing operation. It was often necessary
to blast a hole for the pole by the use of
giant powder, and an ex-miner, who had
bad an extensive experience with explo
sives, was assigned to the job.
The digging of one pole hole would
sometimes occupy him a whole day,
working honestly. Over 300 pounds
of powder were used on the line
for this purpose. When the conti-
nental divide was reached the poles had
to be abandoned and the wires placed
in a cable, which was buried in a two-foot
trench for a distance of 7600 feet. The ad
visability of abandoning aerial construction
at this point was demonstrated by the ex
perience of the company that maintains
the Denver and Leadville line. At one
point on that line, Mosquito Pass, the
poles were originally set seventy feet
apart As the wires were covered with
sleet they snapped and the line was use
less. Double the number of poles was
used, with tbe same result. Tbe space be
tween the poles was then reduced to
twenty-five feet, but when the sleet came
the line was swept down flat. Eventually
an underground cable was laid for two and
a half miles and there has been no trouble
since.â Denver Field and Farm.
NEW ELECTRIC ELEVATOR
A Sarv Franciscan IrWents Or\e TKat Neither
Jerks Nor Jars
Ever since elevators have been in gen
eral use inventors have been at work try
ing to overcome that "jerkiness" so mani
fest when the machinery starts or stops
which is so unpleasant to the passengers.
The most elaborate machinery has been
constructed to this end, but there was
little improvement until E. M. Fraser of
this City thought of a new principle.
That was some time ago and he now has
a complete machine in operation in the
new brick building near the corner 01
Main and Mission streets. A Call repre
sentative rode in it a few days ago and
found all of the objectionable features in
the old elevators entirely overcome. It
swung between the floors with the ease of
a bird in flight in midair. Up to the top
and then back without apparently stop
ping at all. It could be stopped or
sturted. anywhere without the slightest
jar. With such ease does the Fraser ma
chine work that it seems surprising and
it is really a pleasure to ride in it.
How has this been accomplished? will
be asked. And it can be answered, by an
Elevator Diagram..
entire departure from old principles. In
the old machines, hydraulic, electric and
steam, the start of the elevator-car was
made from a "dead" machine. As a con
sequence, there was considerable lost mo
tion to be taken up before the momentum
was communicated to the car.
Mr. Fraser has overcome this by using
electric motors ana keeping them running
all the time during the hours the elevator
is to be used. The accompanying diagram
will explain the principle of the machine,
although no attempt has been made to
follow the details or proportions of the
working apparatus. Briefly, the principle
is that of the differential pulley-block,
but accomplished by changing the speeds
of the pulleys instead of having them of
different sizes.
AA represents the electric motors run
ning in opposite directions; Bl B2 the
pulleys coniv cted to the motors by an
endless rope; C the winze around which
the rope passes several times, that con
nects the two lock pulleys; E the ele
vator-car, suspended by a rope that passes
over a pulley and is connected to the same
shaft (D) as the winze.
If both of the motors are running at the
same speed it follows that the rope will
travel over the pulleys (81, B2) without
changing their positions. But should the
speed of the lower motor be increased and
the upper motor decreased there will be a
pull on the descending rope from pulley
Bl that will cause it to descend. This will
cause the winze to revolve and raise the
pulley 82. Power is thus communicated
to the shaft (D), and the elevator de
scends. Reversing the movement causes
the elevator to ascend.
The changing of the speeds of the
motor 3is accomplished by the U3e of an
ordinary resistance coil. The electric
current is simply turned out of one field
into another. As the motors are running
all the time, it follows that there can be
no jerk, no matter how suddenly the
change from one field to the other is
made. All practical machinists who have
seen the Fraser elevator pronounce it the
simplest and most practical machine built,
aside from the fact that the cars are the
most comfortable to ride in. The cars can
be made to run at the rate of 500 feet a
minute if de.-ired.
Turning Silver Into God.
Dr. Stephen H. Emmens, the inventor
of the fearful explosive, "Emmensite,"'
and a scientist of recognized ability, has
made public a discovery that, if true, is
the most wonderful of the century.
He declares on his reputation as a prize
man of Kings College, London, and a
pupil of the celebrated chemist, J3loxam,
that he has discovered a method of chang
ing silver into sold. He further asserts
that a laboratory ia about to be erected in
the vicinity of New York in which the
process will be carried on in a commercial
way.
Dr. Emmens will not as yet make known
any details of the discovery. All he will
say is tbat the relations of the two metals
to each other, chemically, and their con
stant association in nature, has long made
it probable that they were bat different
forms of the same substance, just as char
coal and the diamond are allotropic forms
of carbon.
Working on this line, he says that it
has been found that neither of the metals
is an elemental body. On page 431 of the
last edition of Bloxam's chemistry there
iri a statement of recent discovery made by
the scientist Cary Lea of Philadelphia,
which Dr. Emmens says is the key to the
problem of the relation of silver to gold.
Working along these lines he says it
has been found possible to dissolve gold
as easily as sugar in water, just as Lea
says he dissolved silver. The color and
action of the resultant solutions are the
same, and on aggregating the particles of
the silver solution a substance has been
secured which has all the characteristic
reactions of gold. . The problem of making
this transmutation of commercial value he
asserts has also practically been worked
out.
Dr. Emmens has records to ahow tbat
thirty years ago he produced artificial dia
monds from a carbon solution, and he has
been at wort ever since on the problem of
the divisibility of the so-called elemen
tary substances. He is not alone in these
experiments, but does not care to give the
names of his associates.
Be says that the present announcement
is made somewhat before it otherwise
would have been, because he thinks that
it is his duty as a citizen to make known
a discovery that will of necessity settle
forever the warfare between silver and
gold in the financial world.
He further says that be is aware of the
sensation that the announcement will
make, and that he is prepared to stand by
it before the scientific world, which is
alone able to pass judgment upon it.
The Submarine Naval Boat.
The New York people who are interested
in the submarine boat being built for the
navy in Baltimore are concerned whether
the Navy Department will authorize the
construction of another craft of like type.
This, from present indications, does not
seem probable, although the matter de
pends entirely on the results obtained by
the boat now under way.
Most naval officers have little faith in
this type of war craft Perhaps this oomes
from their lack of precise knowledge of
such boats, and it may spring also from
tbe natural distrust of a boat the chief
functions of which must be carried on
under the water. The builders must, under
their contract, demonstrate to the Gov
ernment the reliability of the new boat;
they must operate it in all the numerous
ways called for under the specifications,
and if they are able to do all that is re
quired of them, and ever come to the sur
face again, there will probably be estab
lished a confidence in the boat which does
not at present exist.
The foreign submarine boats operate
without much accident, and there is no
reason, theoretically, why the American
craft, an admittedly superior boat of its
type, should not be a success. Whether
it will have the tactical value claimed for
it by the inventor remains to be seen. It
is reasonable, however, to suppose that a
boat navigating under the water, out of
sight of an enemy, would be capable of
doing more damage than a much more
powerful boat, the movements of which
were known to an alert antagonist.
The latest naval appropriation act al
lows the Secretary of the Navy to have
built two more submarine boats if the
Baltimore craft proves satisfactory. It is
yet too early to determine tbe practicabil
ity of the first boat of this type, but this
does not prevent naval officers from as
suming the disadvantages of the boat.
They admit the possibility of its value,
and they appreciate the varied offices
which the inventor believes may be per
formed by his mechanism. They have,
notwithstanding, a feeling that the boat
will not be duplicated. If it shall succeed
in meeting all the requirements, which
are numerous and severe, the navy will
have a valuable craft and the battle fleet
an important ally. â New York Times.
According to â¢ the Ceylon Observer a
very interesting experiment on the culti
vation of Para rubber is being made on
one of the estates in that country. About
a year ago some 50,000 plants were pur
chased and planted on the estate, and the
trees are now said to show a surprising
growth, as do also those on the Govern
ment's experimental plantation in the
same district. As is well known, the de
mand for good rubber is now in excess of
the supply. During the years 1894-95 the
value of the rubber exported from Para
was upward of 37,000,000 milreis, being
rather more than double the value of the
exported rubber for the year 1890-91.
It appears from the report of the foreign
trade of China for the year 1895, recently
issued by the China Imperial Maritime
Customs, that in connection with the silk
industry of China the steps initiated by
the Inspector-General to implant in China
the Pasieur system of detecting and erad
icating disease in silkworms have suc
ceeded in the Kwangtung province.

THE
STAGE
It takes a divining rod, perhaps, to find
water beneath the soil. Some mystical
witch-hazel twig twists, turns, points to
the springs which well below, and ali that
it is necessary to do is to smite and oift
gushes a crystal flood as plentifully as
from Horeb's rock. Now the dramatist
who has divination sufficient to put the
matter in another way can unlock the
fountains of tears so that his audiences are
happily dolorous, lachrymosely glad, com
fortably miserableâ ir? short, shall not
only be suffused when they sit in his
magic circie, but they shall so commend
him from their hearts of pity and sym
pathy that all their friends will come also
to weep in ecstasy and go away with
pathos within them.
The case in point to which these general
remarks refer is local. During the past
week there have been two plays on local
stages which have been heard of widely.
One of these, "The Two Orphans," has
been at Morosco's Grand Opera-bouse.
The other, "The Masqueraders," has been
before the public at the Baldwin Theater.
The element of woe . pervades the first j
named throughout. There are three dif- j
ferent sources of tears iv it; three sets of
circumstances which run together to pro
duce one deep and wide salty rill.
Women went to the Grand night after
night and took their children there. Sobs j
and sighs were heard and little children
Wailed. The latter cannot be suppoied to
have beeu overcome with the pathos of
what they could not understand, but their
acts led to a phenomenon. Fond mothers
of these unhappy babes went out and I
quieted the babes, but returned to be fur- i
ther penetrated by grief. Every night '
there was a full house.
Now "TheMasqueraders" proceeds upon
a totally different plan. The author has
collected in the compass of its few acts a
Tery choice aggregation of social nonde
scripts, probably through a desire to sat
irize pretense, and has given them lines
which are sardonic but very witty. Un
questionably the dialogue is clever and
undoubtedly the epigrams are good. But
the audience did not applaud one of these
sentiments. When, however, the heroine
weeps and bemoans Her sad fate, and
when at another time she thinks that her
child is about to be taken from her, the
audience was with her to a man and
woman and felt that their emotions had
been properly stirred. So also the "Bo
hemian Girl" number that was most
called for was the ballad about "The
Heart Bowed Down."
This week the attractions are good,
musically as well as dramatically. The
advancement of the season is indicated by
tbe announcement that the Alcazar will
be reopened the-, first week in September.
Fashion is turning homeward from the
country and the seashore, and the theaters
will soon show the effect of their ingress.
The general announcements for the forth
coming week are given below-
Baldwin Theater.
A French comedy written on lively lines
is what "The Gay Parisians, 1 Which will
be presented at the Baldwin* to-morrow
night, is said to be. The play was" done
in New York at Hoyt's Theater in the be
ginning of last season and met with such
tremendous favor that it crowded out
Hoyt's own plays and held possession of
the house for over 200 nights. It is an
adaptation of the French farce "Hotel de
Libre Exchange," which has been running
at the Nouveaute Theater, Paris, for over
a year, and it follows the lines of the orig
inal so closely that Charles Frohman, who
owns the piece, ciaims that it is a free
translation of the i J aris play.
William J. Ferguson is at the head of
the company, and the part he plays gives
him fine onpo rtunities. Sadie Martinot
is the leading lady and tbe other members
of the company are James O. Barrows, C.
B. Wells, W. H. Shiiley, Sully Marshall,
Frank Durant, Louis Hendricks, Vaughn
Glaser, Frank A. Connor, Mrs. E. J. Phil
lips. Margaret Gordon, Claire Rodrigue,
Ver.'ie Graves, Nellie McCaul, Judith
Bordeaux and Frank Morris.
This is the story of "The Gay Parisians."
It seems that Mr. Paillard is a gentleman
whose business is not exactly understood
by his wife. The business takes dim away
from home often and keeps him out ail
night sometimes. He explains as best he
can, but Mrs. Paillard cannot grasp all the
points of his explanations. She very fool
ishly arrives at the conclusion that Mr.
Paillard is doing wrong, and that he is
"out with the boys at night."
So she resolves to be avenged upon him.
With the aid of Mr. Pinglet, who is old
' enough to know better and who has a very
jealous wife of his own, she arranges a
I programme of rash and reck Jess con
j duct. She will go out for an evening her-
I self and see what this thing of "being
with the boys" means. Pinglet agrees to
chaperone her on this desperate occasion
and succeeds in getting away from Mrs.
Piuglet, whom he tells that he has an ex
traordinary engaeement at the other end
oi town. Mrs. Paillard and her quaint
knight, who is almost old enough to be
her father, go to the theater and later
visit a restaurant, where they order a fine
| supper. But they are not destined to have
i an evening of unalloyed delight.
A dozen things happen to disturb and
threaten them with discovery. First of
â  ali Mr. Paillard has business in that very
j restaurant and is in the room opposite to
that assigned to the carousing couple.
Then a stuttering friend with four chat
tering girls drops in on them. G; osts
create trouble. Spying waiters bore auger
holes into Pinglet's back. The police raid
the restaurant, Pinglet and Mrs. Paiilard
are arrested anÂ«J there is a lot of trouble.
The police carry the news to Mrs. Pinglet,
and for a while it looks as if the tangle of
jollity would never be solved. But the
offenders escape scot free in the end and
everybody is happy.
At the Columbia.
Tt has been decided to continue Augustin
Daly's "Great Unknown" at the Columbia
Theater during another week, the recep
tion which it has met with having recom
mended it to the management for a longer
run than was at first planned for it. "The
Social Trust," which was originally billed,
j has been postponed until a week from
i Monday, August 24. Great preparations
are being made for the first performance
of this comedy-drama upon any stage.
"The Social Trust" was written especially
for the Frawley Company by the two well
known authors, Hilary Bell and Ramsay
Morris. It is a comedy-drama, the story
of which is founded upon the incidents
connected with the famous Cordage trust.
It is said that the playwrights have em
bodied the intensely dramatic features of
the career of the trust and have drawn
their characters irom life with accuracy
and truthfulness. The play will have the
advantage of interpretation at the bands
of the i rawley Company, which includes
Wilton Lackaye, Mrs. Thorndyke Bouci
cault, Miss Blanche L. Bates and ail of
the important members of tbe Frawley
Company, including tbe reappearance of
T. Daniel Frawley himself. For this pro
duction special scenery and stage effects
have been got up and it is not unlikely
that following the present engagement
the play will be taken to New York City
for a run.
California Theater.
To-night will mark the- last performance
of "The Irish Artist." Chauncey Olcott
to-morrow night will present a new play
entitled "The Minstrel of Clare." This
latter piece was given in New York last
spring and ran for two weeks to crowded
houses. It was written by the late Fred
Marsden and depicts peasant life in
County Clare in the middle of the present
century. It mainly deals with the land
question and tells a story of gambling,
ruin end love. A young Irish-American,
Larry O'Lynn, has returned to Ireland to
claim an estate bequeathed to his father
by Cecil W T ynbert. The elder O'Lynn,
having been identified in the rebellion ot
1848, fled to America, and on his deathbed
admonishes bis son to return to Ireland
and claim the estate as the heir.
He bids him to seefc out his old friend,
Morris Cregan, and obtain the latter' s ad
vice and assistance. The scene opens at
Cregan' s farm. Larry arrives and meet
ing Cregan's daughter, Nellie, at once
proceeds to fall in love with her. She
does not reciprocate, however, and the
battle of words between them is one of the
principal comedy features of the play.
Cregan's son has become involved in a
gambling scrape and is about to be ruined
by Mat Dongan, when Larry comes to the
rescue and helps him out. In the mean
time a cousin of Cecil WynDert, Robert,
has taken possession of the Wynbert es
tate in face of the fact that there has been
no will found and he is the next of kin.
He has set a covetous eye on the Cregan
farm, which adjoins his place, and seeing
the possibility of enhancing the beauty of
his place if the Cregan farm were his, i.c
makes overtures to Cregan for the sale of
the farm.
The old farmer indignantly refuses and
Wynbert in a rage swears to make him
give it up. To this end he procures the
services of one Mat Dougan, a bitter foe of
the Cregan family, to buy up the gambling
notes of young Cregan, which he holds
over the head of the old man. Cregan
fearing disgrace and being unable to meet
the notes with, ready money is about to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, suiNl^Ar, AUi*uÂ»r jlo, _o*o.
sell the farm to Wynbert, when Larry
steps in and proves his right to the owner
ship of the Wynbert estate, and a first
class eviction follows with the landlord on
the wrong side of the case. Of course Nel
lie and Larry are united and the s'.ory end 9
prettily enough to pleaie any Irish au
dience. The scenery of the "Minstrel of
Clare" is on the same scale as both of the
previous Fitou productions and the cos
tuming is also a feature. The part of Larry
O'Lynn is said to be particularly well
suiied to Mr. Olcott, being a character
most natural to him, that of an Irish-
American. He introduces several new
songs, some of which are of his own com
position. The play will be given with the
some cast as that seen in the other pieces.
At the Tivc.li.
The seventh week of the grand opera
season under the direction of Gustav
Hinrichs at the Tivoli Opera-house will
he devoted to the careful presentation of
Verdi's wondrously popular opera, "II
Trovatore." The cast will include Sig.
Michelena and Martin Pache, who will al
ternate as Manrico the troubadour, Sig.
Maurice de Vries and John J. Raffael as
the Count de Luna, Sig. Abramoff and
Richard Karl as Ferrando. Mme. Natali
and Nina Hertini Humphreys as Leo
nora. The popular contralto, Miss Flora
Finlayson, formerly of the Bosto
nians and Lillian Russell and
herald-square opera companies, will
make her first appearance at this house as
Azucena, the gypsy mother, which role
will also be essayed by Bernice Holmes.
The smaller parts will be in the hands of
Irene Mulle, Edward Torpi and SignorNa
poleoni. Special scenery, correct cos
tumes and appropriate accessories will all
garnish the production. Preparations are
on for the forthcoming presenta
tions of the divine inspirations of Verdi's
"Aida," also his dramatic story "La Travi
ata," Bellini's tuneful "La Sonnambula,"
r.nd the first presentation west of New
i'ork of Humperdink'3 fairy opera, "Han
sel and Gretel."
Morogco's Grand Opera-House.
After a week of sixteenth century ro
mance Manager Morosco brings his com
pany right up to date and is to produce
the noted ntival melodrama,-"The Ensign."
The interesting story of love and war
told in "The Ensign" has always been
popular. With its framework of Cuban
scenery and the forbidding Morro Castle
in the immediate foreground the play is
even more attractive. It is to be staged
with the greatest attention to detail, and
the double deck of the great United States
ship San Jacinto will be quite a marvel of
the stage mechanic's art.
Mr. Brophy has been playing the title
role of "The Ensign" throughout the East
for the past two year?. This insures an
artistic performance on the part of the
star. To strengthen the cast a number of
artists have been especially engaged for
this week.
W. L. Gleason, who was one of the
original cast, has been engaged to take the
role of Coxswain Jack Dudley, and little
Mildred, the clever child actress who made
a great success of the part with the Fraw
leya, is to be Mary, the cousin of the
heroine, Alice Greer, a part to be filled by
Kate Dalglish. George Olrai, J. P. Winters
and Agnes Rankin have also been specially
engaged.
Harry Benrimo, a younz local actor
who has won pre-eminence by his mastery
of the art of make-up, is to be Abraham
Lincoln. Leslie Morosco will appear for
the first time since a serious spell of sick
ness.
This will be the final week of Mr.
Brophy's engagement. To commemorate
the fact, a handsome photographic souve
nir of Mr. Brophy, bearing a fac-simile of
the handsome young actor's autograph, is
to be distributed to the ladies attending
Monday night's performance.
The Orphenm.
The new people at the Orpheurn for this
week include Mildred Howard and Syd
ney DeGray, also Favor and Sinclair.
Miss Howard is a very graceful dancer
and is said to make a fine stage appear
ance. She will introduce her sensational
Trilby dance. Mr. DeGray, a noted
barytone, will render the latest song suc
cesses. Favor and Sinclair are credited
with being very clever comedians, and to
make no end of fun in the comedy sketch,
"The McGuires," in which is pictured the
every-day happenings in a plumber's shop.
Kennedy will continue his seances of fun
and merriment with hypnotic subjects
changing his programme nightly.
Some of the things Mr. Kennedy does
he does not attempt to explain. His ex
hibitions at the Orpheum are very funny.
Biondi remains lor this week only. He
has Eastern engagements that cannot
be longer postponed. Were it not for
this he might play on and on at the
Orpheuni without his popularity waning
in the least. He is one of the very best
drawing cards that the Orpheum has had
in many a day. Herr Techow's cats are
another pleasing feature, and the Black
Patti will appear in a new repertoire of
songs. The four Nelson sisters are per
forming great' acrobatic acts. What is
most pleasing about their work is the ease
and grace with which they perform the
most difficult feats. Altogether the new
bill is very attractive and the crowded
houses should continue. Matinees every
Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.
The Alcazar-
The Alcazar will be reopened during the
first week in September under the man
agement of Belasco, Doane and Jordan,
the lessees. During.tne.season the attrac
tions will include several new plays. The
right to "The Ugiy Dufkling," which is
the play in which Mrs. Leslie Carter made
her first appearance, has been secured
from David Belasco. The name of other
plays will be announced from time to time.
At the Chutes.
The chutes are growing more popular
every day, and the continually varying at
tractions offered in the Casino and on the
Haight-street grounds serve to crowd the
place.
Fredericks, the "demon cyclist," has
been dashing down the long slide every
night about five times as fast as the boats
do, and this afternoon and evening he will
lepeat the feat for the last time In the
City. It is a most exciting ride, and the
coaster appears to enjoy it as much as the
spectators.
At 4:30 o'clock to-day Emil Markeberg,
the daring aeronaut, wili make a balloon
ascension and parachute drop. He is,
without doubt, the nerviest man who ever
came down from aloft.
"Joe," the wonderful orang-outang who
does everything but talk, will be on exhi
bition for the last limes this week. He
wili receive visitors every afternoon and
evening.

street urchins till Olcott wished he had
never written it.

Knights of Tara and K. R. B. R fles at the
Cal fornia Theater on Monuay night,

Kate," in which her greatest success was
achieved at the Lyceum Theater.

gest hit at the Columbia Theater of any

ley Company. There are curtain calls
nightly. Much interest is manifested in
the production of "Tbe Social Trust."
Miss Sadie Martinot, who will be seen in
"The Gay Parisians'" Monday night at the

ing lady of Dion Boucicault, who once ex
claimeu: "She is a fine actress, soft and
womanly. She is the real Colleen Bawn,
and that is all one can say."
R. H. Stephens' play, "On the Bowery,"
will soon be presented here. The &tory
deals with the real and fancied exploits of
Steve Brodie. The scenes embrace a leap

cluding tbe interior of Brodie's saloon.
At the Baldwin Theater, following "The
Gay Parisians," Manager Augustus Pitou

all of which are necessary to the develop
ment of the plot; and to perfectly inter
pret these characters not only an unusu
ally large but also an unusually intelligent
company Is required.
Miss Retena Helen Owens gave a very
successful dramatic reading of "Hagar"
during tbe past week before the Native

STEPPED
FROM THE BAR TO
LETTERS
A great many literary men, poets
especially, have been lawyers or have
been called to the bar, which is perhaps
not quite the same thing. Cuming Walt
ers, an Englishman, points out that the
present British laureate at one time prac
ticed at the bar; that Sir Lewis Morris can
be claimed for the law, and that the same
profession gave Stevenson to literature.
Barry Cornwall had an extensive legal
practice, and among others who "started
toward the woolsack and branched off to
Parnassus" are James Smith of "Re
jected Addresses," Shirley Brootcs, Sir
Theodore Martin, W. 8. Gilbert and
Calverley. Among lawyers who have
also done distinguished work in the
realm of fancy are Ernest Myers,
Herman Merivale, Sydney Dobell and
Arthur Henry Hallam. Lord Macaulay
was called to the bar at 26; then there
was Sir Walter Scott, who attained
the dignity of a "Shirra," and among
a host of others there are Stanley
Weyman and Anthony Hope. Alto
gether, since the time of Bacon
the legal profession has done a good deal
lor literature. Many of the greatest dra
matists â Wycherley, Beaumont, Ford,
Congreve and others â were lawyers,
but none of "them in sound knowl
edge of law equaled Shakespeare.
Lord Campbell, a former Lord Chief
Justice of England, in the year 1859 pub
lished a book entitled "Shakespeaie's
Legal Acquirements," in which he sub
mitted three-and-twenty of the thirty
seven plays to a somewhat close examina
tion and deduced therefrom a large
number of examples illustrative of legal
knowledge or acquaintance with techni
cal terms on the part of the author.
Abounding as are these law phrases,
points and metaphors, the marvel is that
they are always accurate and appropri
ately used. There is never a mistake.
"While novelists and dramatists," says
Campbell, "are constantly making mis
takes as to the law of marriage, of wills
and of inheritance, to Shakespeare's law,
lavishly as he propounds it, there can be
no demurrer, no bill of exception, no writ
of error."
NEW USES
FOR THE HOMING
PIGEONS
Something new in the employment of
homing or carrier pigeons is about to be
attempted in this locality. So much has
been said concerning these birds during
tbe past year that a genuine interest in
their capabilities has been developed. The
Navy Department, as previously has been
published, has established stations for the
use of shipping, and especially for the
benefit of the navy, along the coast of the
Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.
The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
has accepted an offer from A. Carlisle, a
local pigeon-fancier, to provide pigeons
for an experimental service between the
Farallones and San Francisco, and steps
arc being taken to make this offer
effective. There is a physician in
Antioch who takes pigeons around in
baskets and leaves them at houses where
the cases are such that his services may
be promptly needed and the friends of the
patients release the birds, which there
upon straightway notify their owner to
call. The latest proposition is that sum
mer hotels and camping parties shall have
pigeon service. Ardent lovers, parted by
the cruel demands of business require
ments, may yet send messages flying back
and forth. While the young lady sighs,
"Oh, send me a letter from home,"
she may receive one every day or
several times each day by employing
a sufficient number of birds. Shop
ping can be expedited between the
stores and the summer hotels and another
year it may not be unusual for the shopper
to send her "samples" to their suburban
destination by the swift wings of the
bomers. To camping parties off tbe lines
of travel and distant from telegraph
offices, the pigeon offers facilities for find
ing out about business and also for send
ing home the latest fishing and hunting
stories. This plan is under consideration.

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During the
week there have been nine arrivals from the Coast
mines with 15,600 tons of Coal, from Australia
70Â»7 tons, Jrom f.ngland 2096 'ons, from china
1*47 tons. Altnougn the receipts recently have
not been excessive, still there appears ample quan
tity in the different yards, which would indicate a
falling off of deliveries of late Jobbers are com
plaininv of dull trade and d faculty in collections,
still this appeals to be the general status Of all
commercial branches for the moment. Some of
our steam colliers are bein* retired, awaitinu a re
vival of business or a reduction ot socks on hand.
Australian suitiments are being made very slowly
since the adjustment of the labor troubles thers;
ibis Is mainly attributable to the local demand
which has ih& first call on the collieries, and
steamers uave the priority over sailers There are
only tliree cargoes of Coal now en route from New
castle, as three of the vessels are coming here with
ballast, having canceled tneir coal charters There
Is another grade of Const fuel now on the market
soliciting public favor, the 'Roslin' from Washing
ton. Tiie present asking prices for steam fuel for
future delivery are very enticing, being lowor than
ever before known, and prudent managers of mills
and tactones are now making contracts."

NAVAL ENGINEERS
ARE OVERWORKED
Something Must Be Done
to Ameliorate Their
Condition.
THE STRAIN TOO GREAT
Meeting Will Be Held in This
City to Diccuss the Situa
tion.
WHAT EUGINEER MATTICE SAYS
He Declares the Naval Department
Is Corrupt to the Very Foun
dation.
The dispatches from Washington yester
day contained the information that the
chief engineer and tbe pas?eu assistant en
gineer of the battle-ship Indiana had col
lapsed physically. On the face of it there
is nothing alarming in such a condition of
affairs, but when it is known that the use
fulness of the most powerful vessel of the
North Atlantic squadron is temporarily
impaired, the situation assumes a differ
ent aspect.
The matter is of local interest because
there are a number of war-vessels either
making their headquarters here or are
permanently stationed at this port. The
I'nited States engineers have frequently
complained of overwork, but their pro
tests have been as often ignored. On
March 31 last The Call said editorially:
The marine engineers of San Francisco and
elsewnere are properly urging the passage of
the Wilson bill to reorganize and increase the
efficiency of the navy. This country has been
very slow to appreciate Â»he revolutionary
effect produced by the modern high develop
ment of. marine steam machinery. It is now
more than a mere matter of driving vessels b>
steam instead of SRils. for botn high speed and
the employment of steam for working the
heavr n-mamentsof warship? have introauced
complicHtions imposing the severest exact ions
on engineerimr skill. While this standard of
duties has been raised enormously there has
**en nothing Uke a corresponding increase in
the number of engineers and their official
grade in the service. The Wilson bill is in
tended to cure these shortcomings along with
others. . .
England shows a better understanding of
the matter. Her men-of-war carry a larger
number of engineers than ours. Compare, for
instance, the American Cincinnati of 10 .000
horsepower and the British Sybille of Â»000
horsepower. The Cincinnati carries eight line
officers and the sybtlle six. But when it comes
to engineers we find the Cincinnati with three
and the smaller English vessel with four. The
same disproportion exists in the case of the
American Bennington when compared with
the English Brisk. On tne other hand, we
find that some of the American ships have
twice as many line officers as the same class of
ships in the English navy, while the English
ships almost invariably have more engineers
than ours.
The WilÃon bill, besides increasing the num
ber of engineers, raises their rank and thus
justly recognizes their skill and responsibility.
The present attitude of the line officers to
wards the engineers is a remnant of the time
when steam was in its infancy as a fuctor in
determining the efficiency of a fighting ship.
The bill, by raising the dignity and rank of
the Engineering Corps, removes the unwilling
ness of young men to enter the naval academy
for the purpose of learning the engineer's art
and thus reduces the pressure for positions as
line officers. In these days of very high attain
ments necessary to handle the machinery of a
modern warship it is time that the efficiency of
the navy should be increased by investing the
Engineer Corps with the dignity and prestige
it so eminently deserves.
In April last Asa M. Mattice of Cam
bridge. Mass., late of tne Engineer Corps,
United States navy, addressed a letter to
Congressman Wilson. Pie claimed many
things, not the least, of which was that
corruption had brought about the present
condition of affairs. Among other things
he says:
A glance at the Navy Register of January 1,
1896, shows that we have but 173 engineers in
tbe navyâ a smaller number than at any other
time since "before the war." At the same
time we have in the line, or sailor branch, 714
officers, or 4.13 line officers to each engineer.
A comparison of this ratio with that of years
past will reveal some startling discrepancies.
In 1864, in war time, there were 2846 line
officers and 1728 engineers, regular and vol
unteer, or a ratio of only 1.64 to 1. Of this
numUer there were in the regular service 404
line officers and 501 engineers, or more en
eineers than line officers. These numbers had
need fixed by the necessities oi war, and it Is
by reason of wars that navies exist.
In 1866, just after the close ol the war,
there were in the regular service 395 line offi
cers and 379 engineers, a ratio of 1.04 to 1, or
practically equal numbers in the two corps.
Since that date the line has increased and the
Engineer Corps dimic-ishea, until we find over
80 per oent more line officers, and engineers
decreased by 55 per cent.
Is the present ratio of engineers to line offi
cers an efficient one? We can learn something
about this by referring to the English navy
fist. They have 1730 line officers and 795 en
gineers, a ratio of 2.18 to 1, or nearly twice
the proportionate number of engineers that
we have. Moreover, their list of line officers
is unlimited by law, and therefore it is reason
able to suppose that their number oi line offi
cers has been fixed as the result of experience,
and that if a greater number were required
they would have them.
A glance at the United States Navy registers
of 1864 and 1896 will fhow facts even more/
startling, as, for Instance, take the iollowing
ships oi various classes :
Year. Ship. ., j *%Â£ â  \ EngÂ°i-

1896 Cruiser Boston... 4.030 2
1896 I Cruiser Marblehead 6,4 M 3
1896 Wooden Cruher Marion.... 753 1
You will see that the most powerful vessel of
to-day has the same number of engineers that
the smallest ironclads had in 1864, although
the modern &hip has over fifty times the
engine-power of the former. There was not
8 ship In the navy in 1864 that could develop
over 1000 horsepower. Few of ihe ships of
the new navy have less than 5000 horsepower,
and they run as high as the 20,800 horsepower
of tne Minneapolis, which ship carries but four
engineers. In 1864 there were 268 steamers
In commission and 77 sailing vessels; yet, with
'M per cent of the vessels without engines,
there were only 1.64 line officers to each engi
neer, while to-day, without a sailing ship in
commission, with mmiv ships without a rag
of canvas, we have 4.13 line officers to each
engineer.
Nominally, the Secretary of the Navy Is at
the bead of naval affairs; practically he is
Dcxt to powerless, for the reason that the
"machine" so manages matters that all com
munications with the Secretary, incoming and
outgoing, are, with but little exception, passed
through the meshes of its net. The Secretary
must depend upon naval officers tor informa
tion and advice and for the execution of his
orders, and the "machine" sees to it that these
iunctions are performed as far as possible by
its own members. I doubt it there has been
any Secretary of the Navy for many years who
has not eventually discovered that he has been
grossly deceived by the very officers whom he
trusted as advisers.
But the "machine" has not confined Its an
tagonism to direct assaults upon the Engineer
Corp*, but by various intrigues it has sought
to indirectly throw discredit upon that corps.
A few years ago there was a greet hue and cry
about alleged serious defects in some of the
new war vessels. The then Secretary of the
Navy was generally credited with attacking
the results of the previous administration for
political effect. Those, however, who knew
the true inwardness of the affair knew that the
Secretary was grossly deceived by bis advisers
in the "machine," who managed to gain his
confidence immediately upon his appointment
to office.
Their ultimate purpose was to discredit the
engineers oi the navy (who had designed the
machinery of these vessels and superintended
its construction), as a means of helping
through a bill introduced in Congress to re
organize the navy in such a way as to put the
engineers more fully under the thumb of the
"machine." It mattered not to them that
they ruined the builder oi the ships as an in
cident of their attack upon the engineers.
Moreover, they went so far as to attempt
to discredit American engineers and ship
builders generally by intriguing to get
English firms to establish plants in this coun
try, and by trying to induce the Secretary to
purchase machinery abroad when their first
scheme failed.
In 1873, while I was a cadet, there were at
the Naval Academy twenty-eight line officers
for 280 cadeis. There are now fifty-one line
officers for 18' i cadets. Comment on this fact
is unnecessary; it speaks for itself.
Please do not think that I presume to uphold
the engineers as a more virtuous body than
the line. Possibly if they had the opportunity
they might develop more black sheep than the
latter and might produce a more corrupt "ma
chine." Each corps has Its incompetents. But
scratch an incompetent Hue officer, and in
nine cases out of ten you will alscover one of
the "machine."
An officer who devotes sufficient time to his
profession to make him a master of it does not
have sufficient leisure to devote to the wire
pulling necessary to make him a "machine"
leader. There are, however, some very effi
cient officers among the underlings of the
"machine," who haVe early discovered that
their bread will be buttered more thickly and
evenly by keeping in touch with the "boss"
than by opposing him.
The local marine engineers indorse prac
tically all that Mr. Mattice says. It is
understood that a meeting will be called
during the coming week to devise ways
and means to remedy the evils named.
They contend that they are now working
under a system which was founded on the
necessities of wooden ships, but which is
not adapted to modern vessels of war.

BEST LOVED OF
DALMATIA'S PEOPLE
VOTED MOST POPULAR.
Mrs. Herzo-Kenny and J.
J. Clecak Highly
Honored.
Result of a Newspaper Contest
Among the Austrian
Slavonians.
CHOSEN BT A LARGE MAJORITY.
Receive Each a Magnificent Diamond
Badge as a Testimonial
of Regard.
A spirited and enthusiastic contest has
been going on for the past three months
among the Austrian-Slavonian population
of this City, who number about 10,000,
and the United States in general through
the columns of the Sloga, a bright weekly
journal published and edited by L. W.
Piskulish. It is, in fact, the first and only
newspaper printed in the Slavonian lan
guage on the Pacific Coast.
The contest was instituted to ascertain
the most popular lady and gentleman of
the Croatian colony in this country. The
result of the voting showed Mrs. Ane
Herzo-Kenny, by a vote of 79,394, to be
the most popular lady, and J. J. Clecak,
by a vote of 57,968, to be the most popular
gentleman.
On August 1 the Sloga gave a ball at the
Alcazar Hall in honor of the winners of
the contest. The hall was beautifully
decorated with flags and flowers, and was
filled with the elite of the Croatian citi
zens of San Francisco and the bay cities.
Six appointed judges announced the con
test at an end, and that Mrs. Herzo-Keuny
was the choice of the people for popu
larity, her votes being 51,904 over all her
many competitors.
The lady was then called to the stage
and tnere, amid a bower of flowers, had
the diamond medal pinned upon her
breast.
After handshaking and cheers had sub
sided Mrs. Kenny responded, and thanked
her people and friends for the honor con
ferred upon her, after which she was pre
sented with a large number of beautiful
floral pieces. A very complimentary ad
dress in English by Hon. J. N. E. Wilson
followed. Then there was a speech, also
complimentary, by Dr. Vicki in the Slavo
nian tongue.
After the ovation to Mrs. Heizo- Kenny
the judges announced the name of Ivan
Clecak as the gentleman wdo had received
the greatest number of votes, 31,968 over
all his competitors. HÂ« was declared the
most popular man among all their people,
and a niagniticentdiamond badge suitably
and handsomely inscribed, similar to that
of Mrs. Herzo-Kenny, was pinned upon his
breast by Mr. Piskuhsh amid great ap
plause. He was the recipient of many
handsome floral pieces. After the honor
conferred upon him he made an appropri
ate address.
Mrs. Herzo-Kenny is descended from
one of the oldest and most distinguished
families of Austria. She was born on the
island of Lis*a, near Dalmatia, Austria.
This island was made famous by the great
naval battle which took place there in
1866. She is a lady whose wealth is com
puted in the millions, and is even more
noted for her charity than for her riches.
Mr. ClecaK, who is a man about 40 years
of age, was born in Konavli, Dalmatia,
Austria. In that city he married a very
estimable lady of superior family. He
came to this coast several years ago and
settled in Oakland, where he engaged
in the hotel and restaurant business.
Through his industry and high integrity
he has become one of the most successful
and popular business men of that city.
DROPPED TWO STORIES.
Charles I<apthorn Has a Narrow Escape
in au Elevator at 405 Market
Street.
Charles Lapthorn, an employe of J. G.
Pettitt & Co., Fremont street, bad a nar
row escape from being killed yesterday
afternoon in the building, 405 Market
street.
He and other employes were engaged in
constructing a dumb waiter in the build
ing. They were on the second story, and
Lapthorn stepped into the cage to see if it
would work all right. By some means or
other the lever did not catch and the ele
vator descended. Lapthorn, seeing hia
danger, grabbed hold of the rope to save
himself as much as possible from the jar
when the elevator struck the bottom.
He was picked up in a dazed condition
and taken to the Receiving Hospital. The
only apparent injury was a contusion of
the back, but he was detained pending
further observation. He lives at 625 San
Jose avenue.
"The elevator should sustain a weight of
160 pounds," said Lapthorn, "and as that
is my weight I thought it would be all
right. I don't know how it happened, but
I suppose Mr. Pettitt, who was working
the lever, lost control of it. I am glad
that I escaped so easily. If 1 hadn't
lifted myself off my feet by holding on to
the rope it would have been worse for me."
THE BIBDE.

FIVE MILLIONS
IS SUED FOR,
The Oregon Improvement
Company Is Made the
Defendant.
DECLARED INSOLVENT.
Farmers' Loan and Trust Com
pany Seek to Foreclose a
Big Mortgage.
THE EXPECTED HAS HAPPENED
The Improvement Company Has Not
Paid Any Interest During the
Past Twenty Months.
One of the largest suit 3 ever instituted
in this City or on the Pacific Coast for
that matter was filed late yesterday after
noon in the United States Circuit Court.
The Farmers* Loan and Trust Company
seeks to foreclose a mortgage executed by
the Oregon Improvement Company of
Portland in 1889 for $15,000,000. though the
amount actnally involved is only a little
over $5, 000,000.
When the institution of the above
named suit became known yesterday it
created intense excitement in railroad and
financial circles. It has been generally
understood for some months past that the
Oregon Improvement Company was in a
bad^ way financially, but on tbe other
band it was believed they would pull
through.
The present litigation arises from a
mortgage executed by the defendants in
1880 for $5,000,000 to cover bonds for a like
amount, and whicii were guaranteed by
the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company.
The bonds in question were 5000 in num
ber of a par value of $1000 each, with 6 per
cent interest, the same payable semi
annually.
The mortgage given by the Improve
ment Company included 16,954 shares of
the Seattle Coal and Transportation Com
pany and the stock of the* Columbia and
Puget Sound Railroad, that corporation
being owned entirely by them. In addi
tion to this the mortgage embraced all prop
erty owned by the defendants, including
sundry railroads contemplated and the
franchises therewith.
In 1889 the Oregon Improvement Com
pany desired to refund the first indebted
ness of $5,000,000, issuing for that purpose
bonds to the extent of $15,000,000, with in
terest at 5 per cent, payable under the
same conditions as the orieinaf execution.
After paying off the mortgage the balance
of the sum realized was to be used in
building new roads, extensions and such
other improvements as the board of di
rectors deemed proper. These bonds were
in turn indorsed by the Farmers' Loan
and Trust Company, the old mortgage be
ing renewed, such other property as was
owned by the company being included.
On June 1, 1896, the Oregon Improve
ment Company defaulted in the semi
annual interest, and again in December.
Formal demand was made for the money,
but all the New York company received
was promises. In Jane of the present
year the defendants defaulted in payment
of interest for the third time. Whereupon
the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company
determined to institute a salt for fore
closure.
Tbe first suit was accordingly begun in
Oregon July last, and now the Burety
Company covers the entire situation by
instituting proceedings here. Their attor
neys are My rick & Deering. It is alleged
in the complaint that the Oregon Im
provement Company is insolvent, hence
the desire on the part of the plaintiff to
foreclose the mortgage.
