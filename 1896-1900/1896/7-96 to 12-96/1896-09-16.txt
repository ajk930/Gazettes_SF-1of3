Gallant Stand of the Republican Party
for the Country's Prosperity
Portrayed.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 15.â From the
crests of the Alleghanies 1500 stalwart
mountaineer farmers of Somerset County,
Pa., descended on Canton to-dny to prom
ise their support to Major McKiniey, and
to assure him that the farmers in the
highlands are as earnestly in favor of
sound money as they are of a protective
tariff. They came with three bands and
rbuny banners inscribed with appropriate
raxty mottoes. Each man wore large
clusters of goldenrod on the lapei of his
coat, and some attached the emblematic
blossoms to their liats.
The delegation was organized by Editor
George R. Scull. This was the lamest
delegation of farmers Major McKinley has
addressed at his home. It comprised one
fifth of the voters of Somerset County.
The spokesman was Farmer N. B. Critch
field. He was introduced by Mr. Scull.
He made a thoughtful speech that was lib
erally applauded. Major McKinley said:
Senator Critchfield ard my fellow-citizens:
It gives me sincere pleasure to meet my
friends and fellow-ci izens of Somerset
County, Pennsylvania, in my State, my city
and my home. You have traveled more than
250 miles to bring to me assurance of your
confidence and of your purpose to give to the
Republican party and its glorious principles*
your united and hearty support. [Great ap
plause.] Your spokesman says that the people
of your county are devoted to farmiDg. Look
ing over this vast audience, and remembering
how far you are from home, I should think
you were devoted to P.epublican politics.
[Tremendous applause.] I do not recalV a
time since the days of the Civil War that there
has been so much solicitude for the rightful
outcome of a National e.ection as this year,
1896. All the people are reading and study
ing and informing themselves in a larger
degree than ever beiore. They want to know
on:y what is best for the country â what will
truly promote their own welfare and insure
the grandest resuhs for the common people.
[Great applause.]
The political situation in tne country is
peculiar. We have few parallels to our present
political pcsi(ioi). We have but one political
party which ;s united and that is ours. [Laugh
ter and applause] Discord reigns iv ali others.
Our time-honored opponent â the Democratic
partyâ is torn and divided. Two National con
ventions have been held by it and two Na
tional ticket? presented, and their platforms
are totally different on every subject and in
almost every stction. The Populist tiarty has
merged its organization into that of the Chi
cago Democratic ana St. Louis silver organiza
tion, and the allies ri re for the most part har
monious, except that each one has a distinct
and different candidate for Vice-President.
[Laugrh'.er.J Happiiy the Republican party was
never more closely united than now, both in
fact and in spirit, and there was never better
reason for such union and never greater neces-'
Bity for it than now. [Cheering and cries of
"That's right."] It is wedded, devotedly
wedded to party principles.
It stands, as it has always stood, for an Ameri
can protective tariff which shall raise enough
money to conduct the severnl departments 61
the Government, including liberal pensions to
the Union soldiers [cheering and hurrahs
for McKiuley]â a tariff that will stop debts and
deficiencies and make the treasury of the
United States only more safe and sound In
every particular. [Applause.]
It stands for a reciprocity that seeks out the
markets of the world for our surplus agricul
tural and manufacturing products without
surrendering a single day's wage that belong?
to the American workingman. [Applause.] It
believes in preserving a home market for the
American farmer [applause]; in opening the
factory ior the American workingman [ap
plause], and the opening up of a foreign mar
ket that can be done with profit to all the
great interests of the United States. [Renewed
applause.] It is, too, for sound money
[cheers] â every dollar worth 100 cents [re
newed cheering], every dollar as good as gold
[continued cheering], and is oppoaed alike to
the free and unlimited coinage of silver and
the issuance of irredeemable paper money, to
which the allied parties seem firmly commit
ted. [Great applause.]
It has always kept silver at a parity with
gold. It proposes to keep that silver money in
circulation and preserve side by side gold,
giiver and paper, .each the equal of the other
and each the equal of tne best, and the best
never to be inferior to the best money known
to the commercial nations of the world. [Tre
mendous cheering.]
It will continue to favor a policy that will
give work to American citizens [applause],
markets to American farmers [cries of "That's
what we want"], and sound money to both.
[Tremendous cheering and cries of "Hurrah
for McKinley"]. We are now convinced, after
three years of experience, whatever msy have
been our political relations in the past, the
truth of the observation of Webster, made
more than half a century ago. You will recall
that he said: "That is the truest American
policy which shall most usefully employ Amer
ican capital aud American labor and best sus
tain the whole American population." [Ap
plause.]
Agriculture, commerce and manufacturing
will prosper together or languish together.
We cannot have commercial prosperity with
out the strictest integrity both oi Government
and citizen. [Renewed applause and cries of
"That's right."] The financial honor of this
Government Is of too vast importance, is en
tirely too sacred, to be the football of party
politics. [Great applause.] The Republican
pÃriy has maintained it and is pledged to
maintain it. It has more than once stood be
tween good faith and dishonor and when i'
gave up the control of the Government our
National honor had never before been so high
ana unquestioned. [Applause ] The Repub
lican part is pledged to maiutain the credit
oi the Government, which is Intimately asso
The San Francisco Call
elated with its spotless name and honor, ana
this it will do under all circumstances and at
any cost.
Cousider, my fellow-citizens, the advance
ment we made between 1880 and 1890. and
uuring those years we never had free trade
nor free silver. [Great laughter.] The marvel
ous progress of the country between 1880 and
1890 is worthy the study of all American citi
zens. It is the best answer to the oft-repeated
but fallacious statement that the country had
been i offering from the effect of tne act of
1873 which stopped the free coinage of sflver.
It is an unanswerable argument for the res
toration of a protective tariff aud the main
tenance of souud money. [Applause.]
Early in the afternoon tbe Grand Army
posts of Stark County called on Major
McKinley. Five hundred veterans marched
with "valiant step but slow" behind the
bands and the old regimental flags â flags
that were torn by shot and rent by
shells; flags that were waved at Shiloh,
raised at Winchester, glorified at Gettys
burg. The veterans marched with a sol
dierly aspect that won them a tribute of
earnest applause ah along the streets
through which they passed. Colonel J. J.
Clark made a brief eloquent addre-s to
Major McKinley on behalf of the visiting
comrades. In answer to Colonel Clark
Major McKinley said:
Colonel Clark, my comrades and fellow-citi
zens: It is a very great honor to me, and one
which I shall always cherish, to receive this
call from my old comrades of the war living in
this neighborhood. [Applause] I bid you
welcome to my home and express to you in
response to the generous and grateful message
delivered by Colonel Clark my profound grati
tude and thanks. Coming to this city to give
me congratulations not only are those who
served on the Union side during that
great struggle, but the men who served on the
Confederate side. Both have been Here to
tender congratulations and give me assur
ances of support. [Great cheering.] Now ail
are citizens of the common Union aud all of
them ready to battle for that Union and for
the honor and integrity of the Government of
the United States. [Cheering.]
I am glad to meet you here to-day. I was
proud of you when in the field. lam proud ol
you as citizens of the Union which you helped
to save. [Applause.] No grander, no better,
no more glorious army ever marched to battle
for a noble cause than the army of which you
were a part. [Great cheering.] You were pa
triots then ; yovi,are patriots now. You know
no po.itics in your Grand Army posts. [Cries
of "No, no-"] But you know patriotism when
you see it [Applause and cries of "you're
right."] I thank you most warmly for this call
and for the cordiality of your greeting and the
gracious messages which have been delivered
Dy your spokesman: and as another delega
tion is wait ng, I must close by saving that it
will give me great pleasure to shake each one
of my oid comrades by tbe hand. [Great
cheering.]
The call of the Grand Army men was
one of the most impressive visits Major
McKinley has received.
Hon. R. C. Kerens of St. Louis, who
was Major McKinley's guest throughout
the day, has arranged for tbe visit of a
large delegation of farmers from Northern
Missouri on the sth of October. This will
be the first long-distance farmers' delega
tion to visit Canton. It is estimated that
most of those who come with it will have
to travel at least 800 miles.
Among Major McKinley's callers to-day
was Dr. Bartn of Berlin, a member of the
German Reichstag. Dr. Barth has come
to tho United States to study our politics
and will be in this country until after the
Presidential election. To a representative
of the United As.^ociated Presses he said:
"I am much interested in American
politics. 1 have seen, met and heard Mr.
Bryan and I have greatly enjoyed meeting
Major McKinley and seeing the great del
egation which calied on him to-day. He
is a fine speaker. We are in favor of what
you call sound money in Germany and we
do not want the Unit' d States to plunge
itself into grave difficulties by trying to
open its mints to the free coinage of silver
witnout waiting for an] international
agreement."
A tidal-wave of congratulatory messages
rolled into Canton this morning. The
Maine victory is the cause of much re
joicing among Republicans. Among the
messages received were the following:
AUGUSTA, Me.. Sept. 15.â I^ffer you my
hearty congratulations. This idj'our triumph.
The party hHS achieved the most sweeping vic
tory ever accorded any party in the history of
Maine. J. H. Manley.
The president of the National League
Clubs wires as follows:
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 15.â Maine, Vermont
and the boys are with you. That settles it.
D. D. WOODMANSEE.
EVERETT, Wash., Sept. 15.â The far Western
State of Washington sends greeting to Maine.
The citizens of this new manufacturing city
on Puget Bound, irrespective of party, have
fired 100 guns to celebrate the triumph of
honesty and common sense in both Vermont
and Maine. We will clasp hands with them in
November. F. H. Mulfokd,
President Everett Non-Partisan Gold League.
FOR McKINLEY AND SILVER.
Senator Woleott Makes a Telling Speech
at Colorado Spring*.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Sept. 15.
Senator E. O. Woleott delivered his first
speech this evening. He was given
a big reception. Upon his arrival he
was greeted by a large crowd and escorted
to the hotel, where he made a brief speech
from a balcony.
At the Colisseum this evening 4000 peo
ple crowded in to hear him and an over
flow meeting was held in the North Park.
Free excursions were run from Denver and
other cities, bringing in several hundred
people. After dwelling npon local issues
and tne importance to Colorado of protec
tion and an arraignment of the Chicago
platform the Senator spoke as follows:
From the jumble and farrago of the Chicago
platform, with itÃ*Populist appendage, turn to
the Republican platform at St. Louis. Except
on the silver question, the party never stood
more squarely for every thing which we in
Colorado, who have always voted the Republi
can ticket, have held most dear. The candi
date of the convention, high-minded, ab.e,
distinguished both as a soidier and a states
man, clean, upright and of wide experience, is
an ideal American.
So much of the platform as relates to silver
is unsatisfactory to us who live in Colorado.
We wish all Republicans could see this vital
monetary question as we do, and that this
sreat party, which on all other questions af
fecting the welfare of mankind has stood for
the masses against the classes, could have in
sisted on the restoration of silver to its old
place as a standard of value.
The majority of the convention thought
otherwise, however; it declared only for bi
metallism by international agreement, and
pledged ihe party to evtry effort to secure this
agreement. This pledge will be sacredly kept,
and I have for myself every belief that
through the efforts of the Republican party
this result will be attained.
The day of silver is coming. It is my serious
and solemn opinion that the full recognition
of silver will come soon, that it will com' 1
through the efforts and under the direction of
the Republican party, in which the conserva
tive people of this country have confidence,
and that it will never come through the
Democratic-Populist aggregation headed by
this wandering orator of the PUtte. Your in
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 16, 1896.
ONE MAN'S JOY IS ANOTHER MAN'S SORROW.
terests and mine are all in Colorado. To-day
our State is depressed and impoverished. A
brighter future is in store for us, and it will
come, as every other good thing has come to
C#lorado, under a Republican administration;
It will come with William McKinley at the
helm of state.
The campaign upon which we ha^e entered
differs from all those which have preceded it
in many respects, but especially in tbe delib
erate effort here and elsewhere to array one
section of our common country against the
other, and one class of our ellow-citizens
against other classes. The campaign Is con
ducted upon the false theory that the people
who labor and the people who are In debt
ought to unite against the people who do not
labor with their hand*, or who labor and own
their own homes; that every man who pos
sesses means ib a conspirator against the wel
fare and happiness of the man who must rely
upon the fruits of his daily labor; and that In
asmuch as the men are more largely borrowers
of money in the West and South than in the
North and East, therefore the sections are en
gaged in a bitter and violent war fbr suprem
acy, the interests of one being diametrically
opposed to those of the other.
It is wicked to endeavor to install Into the
mlndÃ of the people in any one section the
opinion that those of anotber are either cor
rupt cr unpatriotic in the views they hold on
the money question. We in Colorado are
honest in the unanimous ooinlon we hold, the
citizens of New England and Pennsylvania
and Ohio and other Northern and Eastern
States are equally honest in their views, and
thereshould be only condemnation of the incen
diary newspaper utterance of the journals of
either section which seek, in order to attract
local subscribers, to vilify ana misrepresent
and abuse the citizens of the other.
DARING EXPRESS ROBBERY.
Two Masked Men Perform a Meat Piece of
Work at West Point and Make
Their Escape.
MEMPHIS, Term., Bept 15.â A special
from West Point, Miss., gives information
of a daring express robbery at that place
early this morning. It states that just as
the express- wagon drove up to the office
door to unload matter received from the
northbound Mobile and Ohio train, at 2
a. M., two masked men stepped from
around the corner and covered the driver
and night clerk with pistols, ordering
them to throw up their hands. They did
so, and were then ordered into the express
office and commanded to open the safe.
After securing such plunder as they could
the robbers ordered tbe express force to
preceae them into the darkness and down
the street in their front. After getting
out of danger the express attaches were
dismissed and told to hustle back to town.
The amount of booty secured has not yet
been ascertained.

PORTLAND, Me., Bept. 15.â The Port
land Daily Press has received returns from
415 towns, cities and plantations in Maine.
These returns aie practically complete for
the counties of Cumberland, York, Andros
coggin, Oxford, franklin, Knox, Waldo,
Piscataquis, Kennebec and Somerset. In
the other live counties there are some re
mote plantations which make up the miss
ing precincts.
The returns of thesr 415 cities, towns and
plantations give for Governor: Llewellyn
Powers (R.), 78,295; M. P. Frank (D.), 31,
-909; L. C. Bateman (P.), 2743; A. S. Ladd
(Pro.), 1279; W. H. Cliffoid (National D.)
576. Powers' plurality from tne^e 415
towns is 46,387.
In 1894, which was the avalanche year
when the Republicans supposed they had
reached their high-water mark, tbe same
towns gave Cleaves (R.). 65,367; Johnson
(D.), 28,354; Batemati (P.), 5614; Hersey
(I'ro.), 2524. Cleaves' plurality, 37,013.
Cleaves' total plurality was 38,817.
Thi< 3hows a ratio of increase in the re
maining towns which will make Powers'
plurality above 49,000.
Full returns from the First District give
Thomas B. Reed 10,474 plurality over
Staples (D.). Congressman Dingley's plu
rality is about 14,000.
THE WEST IS ALL MIGHT.
Pacific Coast 1 States' Expected to Follow
Vermont and' Maine.
: CHICAGO, 111., -Sept; 15.â There was
mutual congratulation ana some surprise
quietly expressed among ' the campaign
workers at Republican National Head
quarters - to-day over the election news
from Maine. Mr. Hanna was not in a
talkative mood. v He thought the returns
did not need any comment and only
hoped the other States he was relying on
would follow the example and do like
wise. He smiled his satisfaction at the
increased plurality and inquired for the
latest figures.
Mr. Hanna will return home next Sat
urday, remaining in Cleveland until Mon
day morning, when he will go to New
York to be at headquarters there a week
or ten days. Then he will come back to
Chicago ana stay at his desk here until it
is necessary for him to go to Cleveland to
vote. He will receive the news in Cleve
land.
When asked to-day as to the tenor of
the reports he has been receiving from the
Central Western States Mr. Hanna said
they showed an improved condition in
Minnesota. There was nothing discour
aging in Illinois for the party, but there
was a close fight in Kansas and Nebraska
and those States were likely to remain
doubtful to the end. The Republicans
from Northern and Central Indiana were
very favorable.
When he returned from New York Mr.
Hanna said he would give some figures as
to probable results in the States, but it
was too early now.
Senator Thurston returned to-night from
the East to resume his labors in the West
ern battle ground.
Congressman L. D. A.psley of Massa
chusetts, vice-chairman of the Congres
sional Committee, who has been speaking
on the Pacific Coast with Congressman
McCall, called and said: "The situation is
improving out there. All factional dif
ferences have been settled in California
and Oregon, and a good fight is being put
up. I have no doubt these States and
Washington will go for McKinley and
protection. That is the issue there new."
IT WILL HELP BUS SI NESS.
Confidence Already â  Being Restored by
. i Republican . Victories.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 15.âChair
man Babcock of the Republican Congres
sional Committee this afternoon gave out
the following statement on the Maine
election:
"The result of the election in Maine will
be of a very great value to all business and
financial interests at this time. It wilJ re
store confidence in financial circles not
only in this country, but throughout the
world. We looked for a large majority in
Maine, but hardly expected it to be equal
to the plurality given in 1894, when so
many Democrats refused to vote; but it
has exceeded that plurality by about 30
per cent, and no one can for a moment
doubt that this vote in Maine indicates
the sentiment of the great Northeastern
States. The States where there are large
manufacturing and agricultural interests,
the Slates whose people read and have an
intelligent voting population, will, in my
opinion, join the procession and follow
the lead set by Vermont and Maine
"The key of the situation in a campaign
is to determine which way the tide is
setting. This, it is often extremely difficult
to do. Two ynars ago at this time, after
the Oregon, Vermont and Maine elections,
I recognized and claimed that they were
indicative of the sentiment of the whole
country, and stated that I believed that
thai practically settled the contest; and
my opinion and prediction were fully
borne out by the result in November. This
year the majorities in Vermont and Maine
are much more pronounced and larger
than they were two years ago, and from
tnis I can draw only one conclusion, as I
have said before, and that is that tbe great
manufacturing and agricultural States
will follow the example set by Vermont
and Maine and give a pronounced majority
against free silver and repudiation that
it will settle the question for all time to
come."
ALL ESTIMATES EXCEEDED.
Ao One Looked for Such an Overwhelm-
mo Victory in Maine.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 15.â Among
the callers at the Republican National
headquarters to-day were Hon. John W.
Vrooman of this city, president of tha
Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company.
He was enthusiastic over the result in
Maine. He said the question is now prac
tically settled so far as the East is con
cerned. Vermont drove the nail as well
as Maine has clinched it solid. Tne moral
effect of the Maine election will be very
great, but we must not rest upon it nor
relax our efforts.
Ex-Congressman W. D. Bynum con
ferred this morning wit General Tracey
and other prominent politicians. He will
address a meeting of the Commsrcial
Travelers' Sound-Money League to-mor
row.
Hon. Matthew Quay was expected to ar
rive in the city to-day, but did not put in
an appearance.
No news was given out this afternoon at
the Democratic headquarters at the Bar
tholdi Hotel.
Mark Hanna is expected in this city to
morrow or next day. Vice-Presidential
Candidate Hobart was at the Republican
headquarters this afternoon. He said that
the Maine election somewhat surprised
him. Instead of 50,000 majority he antici
pated only 30,000.
Affairs were quiet to-day at the Repub
lican State headquarters in the Fifth
avenue Hotel.

THE ARKANSAS ELECTION.
I With All the Fraud Democratic Majorities
Were Lou/ered. - â¢
LITTLE ROCK, Akk., Sept. 15.â Official
returns from 1 last Monday's election h Â»ye
been, received by the Secretary of State
from all counties in the State, except
Scott ; and . Logan, and the majority for
Colonel Daniel W. Jones and the remain
der of the Democratic State ticket is but
38,640. The increase for the Republican
ticket over 1894 is in the neighborhood of
20.000. The -result ; is a great disappoint
ment to , the Democrats, as it was confi
dently believed that the Democratic ticket
would win by at least 60,000 majority. The
Gazette of this city, the State organ of the
Democracy, \up to, Sunday claimed the
State by 80.000. Democratic leaders here
say the large decrease is due to the fact
that a : large number of Democrats re- !
inaiued away from th*> polls, refusing to
vote because Colonel Jones, the Demo
cratic gubernatorial candidate, proclaimid
from '; every stump yin â  the State that fhe
wand not support the Ciiicago nominee if

of the conspirator Tynan to blow up Marl
boroush House, the residence of the Prince
of Wales, when his Royal Highness should
be there. According to this yarn the
dynamiters intended to reach the Prince's
house by tunneling from the house oppo
site. This is a fair sample of the ridicu
lous stories concerning the alleged dyna

merest nonsense and would scarcely be

FUND TO DEFEND TYNAN.
Irish- Americans Will ResUt Bis Extra
dition by England.
NEW YORK, N. V , Sept. 15.â The Irish
National Alliance, which hasita headquar
ters in the Potter building, held a secret
meeting at the home of one of its members
last night, and arrangements were made
to provide counsel to deiend Tynan and
Kearney, the dynamite suspects, and pre
vent them being taken to Eng'ana | for
trial. It is said that $20,000 was subscribed
at this meeting, and the fund will be in
creased to $50,000 when persons friendly to
the Irish cause will sienify their '; willing,
ness to aid in obtaining the freedom of
Ireland by putting their names on. the
subscription list. !
, The names of the men will not be made
public because it would mean, it is said,
constant annoyance by British agents in
this city.
' None of the friends of Kearney and
Tynan here have heard from them di
rectly since their arrest, and all profess to
believe that the two men arc in t .is coun
try attending to their engagements with,
the political parties.
The name of Tynan does not appear
among the speakers selected by the Re
publican National Committee. Tynan told
his friends about the time he left that he
was gome on the stamp for .Bryan and
free silver and had been assigned by the
Democratic National Committee to the
Central States.
The Mail and Express this evening says
that in spite of the surmises of his family
and close personal friends that P. J.
Tynan is still in this country, and that
the man now under arrest in Boulogne is
altogether . another person, there is no
possible doubt that Tynan is under arrest
and in a very serious position. The
charge upon which ,he is now held, that
of complicity in the Phoenix Park mur
ders, ib believed to be a flimsy pretext to
hold him until warrants for a still more
recent and certainly as serious offense
can be. served. Tynan left America on
August last on the Ham burg- American
line steamer Augusta Victoria for Ham
burg.
, Two days before the vessel sailed, the
paper asserts, the notorious anarchist,
Paul Raisin ovitz, with several aliases,
bought the ticket for Tynan, who sailed
under the name of "A. B. Becker" in the
steerage of the steamer mentioned. It is
also learned, the paper xoes on to say, that
Bell, the man arrested in Glasgow, sailed
for Europe on the Teutonic August 12,
under the name of Harris. Every move
the men made here was narrowly watched
by Scotland Yard detectives.
Ralsinovitz, who is regarded by the se
cret service agents in this city as the prime
mover in the scheme, has been known as
one of the cleverest of the nihilists in this
country. He is a chemist of great ability
and is known as a man who rarely talks.
He was regarded in every way as a safe
man.

John F. Kearney, alias Wallace, the alleged
dynamiter, who is under arrest here, was
examined by the police officials this morn
ing, but he declined to answer any ques
tiono whatever. A letter dated at Boulogne
was found in his pockets and is presumed
to have been written by Tynan. In the
letter tbe writer tells 'Wallace" and

arrested here, "If you dare not go to Scot

will talk over our plan among our brother

BATE ALL THE LEADERS.
London. J'oHct Claim to Bare Arrested
the Chief Conspirator*.
LONDON, Eng., Sept 15.â The Daily
News will to-morrow say tbe police be
lieve that they have all the leaders in the
dynamite conspiracy. It is understood
that Bell intended to remain in England
after the proposed explosions took place,
but that the others would return to
America via Havre, sailing thence on Sep
tember 25.
Tynan did not intend to come to Great
Britain, as by so doing he would run the
risk of falling into the hands of tbe po
lice, who were anxious to capture him for
his connection with tbe Phoenix Park
murders; also for his connection with the
dynamite conspiracy, of which he did not
know the police had any information. He
was to stay in France, directing the opera
tions of liis fellow-couspirators from
Boulogne-sur-Mer. The police believe
that one of the prisoners will become an
informer.
The morning papers all devote much
space to details, rumors and theories con
cerning the dynamiters and their plot,
but make no mention of any further ar
resis. It is said that the police are still
searching for somebody in Glasgow.
BOULOGNE-SUR-MER, France, Sept.
15.â The Public Prosecutor to-day exam
ined Tynan and questioned him regarding
his complicity in the murders of Lord
Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke in
Phoenix Park, Dublin.
Tynan denies that he actually took part
in tbe murders. He is aware that his as
sociates in Glasgow and Rotterdam are
under arrest.

ENGLISH PEOPLE BORRIFIED.
Lo*Â« Sight of th* Sultan in Their Panic-
Stricken Condition.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 15.â A special
dispatch to the Sun from London says:
The consternation and horror of the
English people over the revelation of the
dynamite conspiracy are more interesting
than the latest disclosures of the plot it
self. If printers' ink could produce panic
.London would be on tbe verge of nervous
prostration after glancing; at tbe columns
of the usually solemn and unemotional
journals of to-day.
Never before have they so bristled with
all the startling devices of sensational
journalism. Tbe Daily Telegraph, for ex
ample begins, an almost panicky leading
editorial thus:
"England learns to-day bow appalling
has been the danger from which she has
been rescued. That there should have
been a great dynamite conspiracy plotted
in secret and silence by men who are
enemies of the human race; that just at
the moment when their plans were ripe for
action the police should have surprised and
arrested the ringleaders, and that one of
the men, the chief of the band, should be
a criminal wanted for the last lourteen
yearsâ ail these facts are elements in a
story at once vivid, dramatic and ter
rible."
Tbe same newspaper contained a many
columned account of the conspiracy, with
a great scare bead, beginning, in the
blackest letters ever used in its columns:
"Great Dynamite Piol Against England."
All newspapers in the country treat the
matter in the same fashion. This will
give some indication of the popular
sensation which has been created, and
which has distracted attention even
from the critical horrors in tue east
that has raised public sentiment through
out England to a high state of indigna
tion. Tne Sultan, in fact, has to thank
Tynan and his fellow-conspirators for
bringing him some relief in an emergency,
which President Cleveland's Venezuelan
measage furnished in December last.

LONDON, Eng., Bept. 15.â Tbe Btandard

tbe Sultan. Serious trouble, it is added,
is certain to occur within a week.
Old Turkish troopships are nightly de
porting Armenians to the Black Sea,
where it is believed they are drowned.
The British residents, at the instance of

residents have taken similar action. The
British and French fleets are now near the
mouth of tbe Dar laneiles.
Fuad Pasba, one of the Sultan's aid-de
camps, was questioned as to how long tbe
forts along the Dardanelles could check
the passage of warships, and he replied
that they could stop them for almost half
an hour.
Tbe Chronicle and the Daily News will

CONSTANTINOPLE, Tcekey, Sept,
15. â A serious panic occurred to-day in
the Galata quarter in consequence of the
arrest of an Armenian in whose possession
were a number of incriminating letters.
Everybody rushed into their houses, and
the doors of shops and dwellings were
hastily barred, the people fearing a repeti
tion of the looting and massacring. The
panic spread to Pera, and similar scenes
were enacted there. It was not until some
hours after the arreat was made that the
fears of the people were allayed and tbe
shona reopened.

Fair Grounds and Makes a
Gooi Impression.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 15â Hon.
William J. Bryan, accompanied by Sena
tor Blackburn, Congressman Allen of
Mississippi, General P. Wat Harding,
ex-Congressman Stone of Kentucky and
others of prominence, this morning re
sumed his tour of the Blue Grass State on
5 special train, whicti left the depot at
7:45 o'clock. A heavy rain set in shortly
afier the candidate left Louisville, and the
damp atmosphere had its effect on bis
already enfeebled voice when he made his
first speech of the day at La Grange.
At Eminence, where the train arrived
at 9:12, Mr. iJryan was in the midst of his
remarks when the clouds broke. Mr.
Bryan said be would stop talking until
tbe rain ceased, but the crowd would not
lei him and he went ou. Among other
things he said:
If any man in this community would offer to
buy all the eggs produced a. 25 cents a dozen
and was able to make good the offer DObody
would sell eegs for less, no matter what the
cost of production, whether 1 cent or 5 cents a
dozen. So vriih silver. Free coinage would
establish the market price of silver at $129
and nobody would sell it for a cent le6s. Dur
ing the last five years the production of sold
has increased more rapidly, proportionately,
than the production of silver, and yet gold has
advanced, owing to our present financial sys
tem.
A few people only braved the rain to get
a peep at the candidate at Chrlstiansburg.
At several Email stations crowds cheered
the train as it wnisked by.
Frankfort was reached at 10:30 and the
candidate spoÂ£e to an immense throng
from a stand in front of the Capitol. He
said :
Ladies and Gentleman: lam in hearty ac
cord with the declarations cuatalned in the
Chicago platform, [Cheer.'-]. Sometimes peo
ple have described party platforms as like the
platforms of railroad coachesâ made to get in
on, but not to stand on after you get in.
[Laughter.] But that is not my idea of a party
platform. If 1 am elected I will take it for
granted that the people are in favor of the poli
cks for which I at this time stand, and the
people shall never have cause to complain of
my desertion of thÂ« cause which 1 advocate.
I [Cht-ersl.
A voice â What's the matter with Joe Black

Joe Blackburn is where he always Isâ in the

| seems to me that this campaign demonstrates
, more than any recent campaign the power of
j the people to govern themselves. [Cheering.]
] We enter upon a great contest in which Demo
; crats differ. Som? believe in a gold standard.
A voiceâ And let them go.
The buttle was iought out. It was solid at
I Chicago, and In a regular way the majority of
1 the Democrats of ttiis Union declared lor the

! ited coinage of gold and silver [applause] at
j the present rail^> of 16 to 1 [applause], with
j out waiting for the consent or aid ot any other
nation. [Applause.]
All the time he was speaking tbe rain
fell steadily, and just as he was concluding
hie remt rks it became a downpour. The
train left Frnnkfort at 11 a. m , and ar
rived at Midway at 11:30 in a heavy rain,
and no speech was made there.
Mr. Bryan, Senator Blackburn. National
Coninmteeruan Woodson and the others
in the nominee's party were transferred
to a special train on the Southern Rail
way, in which they proceeded to Ver
sailles, which was reached at 12:20 o'clock.
j A band at the station was playing "Old
Kentucky Home" when his train came in,
and with tha; in the lead and followed by,
a troop of horÂ«enien he was escorted to a
stand erected on the beautiful thorough
fare. Here Mr. Bryan spoke to several
hundred people, and then went off to Sen
ator Blackburn's residence, where a ban
quet was> served to a lartro party.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Sept. lS â William
J. Bryan was jriven a rousinar recepiior.
here this evening. He made a BDÂ«ach at
the fair grounds to an immense audience,
estimated at from 12,000 to 20,000. The
fair ground's grand stand, said to hold
8010 people, was used by spectators to the
extent of three-fourths of Its capacity. In
the lower story, which was packed with
humanity, nearly all the places were filled
by men, while in the upper story a ma
jority ot the onlookers were women. On
the track in front ot' trie Kiosk-like judge*
stand from which Mr. Bryan made his
address, several thousand men and boys
stood ankle deep in mud. Elsewhere
about the stand were a couple of thousand
more spectators, Mr. Bryan, Senator
BlacKburn and a big party of Democrats
from Louisville and other places in this
State, reached Lexington from Versailles
over the Southern railway at 2 p. m. and
were met by Btate Senator C. J. Bronston,
chairman of the Democratic State Central
Committee and a number of local suppor
ters of the Chicago ticket.
A procession a mile long, composed of
Bryan and Sewall clubs, and a thousand
horsemen, most of them mounted on
spirited Kentucky thoroughbreds, escorted
Mr. Bryan to tbe fair grounds. The appear
ance of the candidate was tbe signal for
an ovation. Men waved their bats as
they cheered, and the women waved hand
kerchiefs aa they joined in the shouting.
Mr. Bryan was presnted by State Senator
Bronston. Just after the Democratic can
didate had begun bifl speech, a heavy rain
shower drove many of the spectators
from tbe tiela, but their places were taken
by a continuous stream of constantly ar
riving people. On the conclusion of the
speech Mr. Bryan was driven te his special
car at the Louisville and Nashville sta
tion, followed by the cavalcade that had
formed part of bis escort to the grounds.
The train left for Maysville at 5 p. m.
One of the pleasantest incidents of tbe
day was the parade of over 800 horsemen
which passed the stand from which Mr.
Bryan was speaking. In the middle of
bis speech equestrians made their appear
ance carrying banners, and interrupted
Mr. Bryan in his talk, making a very im
pressive sight. They cheered him time
aud again, and fell in line at the outskirt
of tbe crowd and listened to the rest of his
speech. Mr. Bryan said in part:
Nature smiles upon your husbandry. Your
soil gives forth in rich profusion, but, accord
in* to the experience of the farmer, with all he
can do with his industry, with his economy,
with ail his patient toll, he finds tha; the load
of the American farmer grows every year
[Great applause.] In olden tim^s. under" the
rule of those who waved and bore the saber
as they said, by right divineâ complaint was
answered with the Ush; but now the lust com
plaint of the toiling millions of the United
States is answered by charges that they are
anarchist* and socialists. [Great applause]
My friends, there is one unfortunate thing in
connection with the use of the word anarchist
as applied to those who are banded together to
restore the money of the constitution ; there is
one unfortunate tbini? in it. Anarchy is a
thing not to be considered in a land like this.
Anarchy can have no home among the people
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY. SEPTEMBER 16, 1896.
who have the ballot to right their wrongs.
[Great applftUbe.] And ihe unfortunate thing
about this campaign is that the term an- :
archist is applied to tne bone and muÂ«cle of
this country by men who are doing more to
overthrow our Government than any anarchist
who ever carried a red flag. 1 say that when
tbit word Miarchlst is applied to the toiling
millions by men who seek without toil to
usurp the* iruits and reap the rewards of those
who toll, the danger is that it will make the
name respectable becau-e of its association.
[Uproarious applause and loud cheering.]
I protest against the use of that name for the
purpose whicti deprives it of all its terrors.
My mentis, those who are opposed to us can
not afford to place the farmers of this country
and the laborers of this country in the posi
tion of enemies of the Government, because
tlu'v are the only friends any government ever
had. [Applause.] My friends, these very men
who are abused and despised by thosu who
doubt the capacity of the masses for self-gov
ernment are the very people who in time of
emergency must protect "their calumniators
from themselves and tneir associates. My
friends, there is not c. syndicate that has*
preyed upon the public which would not
rathertryitsca.se against another syndicate
before the common people of this country than
before a jury made up oi another syndicate.
[Great applause.] I shall remember this speech
because of the most remarkable parade which
it has ever been my good fortune to witness.
[Applause.] And they bore banners which
present mottoes which makes any further
speaking unnecessary. If I were to talk to you
from now until night I could not more than
emphasize the mottoes which they have passed
in procession before you. I saw one motto:
"Our banks are full, but our pockets are
empty," [applause] and in that sentence is
epitomized twenty years of farming history iv
the United States.
MAYSVILLE, Ky., Sept. 15.â William
J. Bryan ended up his Kentucky campaign
hereto-night by addressing several thou
sand people in a heavy rainstorm. He
reached Maysville by a special train at
7:15 p. m. and left on it for Lexington at
8:30. At Lexington he will change to tbe
regular Queen and Crescent train sched
uled to leave there at 10:45 to-night for
Knoxville and Harriman, Term.
With reference to the great fatigue from
which he suffered yesterday Mr. Bryan
said to the representative of tbe United
Associated Press to-nigbt that he had had
an easy day and in leaving Kentucky be
felt well and strong enough to keep going
for tbe rest of the campaign.
The rain and short time allowed Mr.
Bryan here spoiled the preparations for his
reception to-night. He was placed in a
carriage with Senator Blackburn and
others at the railway station on his ar
rival and huriied to Market and New
streets, where a platform had been erected.
To the people standing in the deep mud
there he made a short address and was
then taken back to his special train. His
audience showed much enthusiasm.
On the way from Lexington to Maysville
Mr. Bryan inaae a speech to a big crowd
of very enthusiastic people.
At Carlisle and other places along the
route be was cheered, but did not make
any remarks.
In his Maysville speech, after referring
to tbe interest people felt in standing in
the rain to hear a political speech, Mr.
Bryan said that when you took gold to fill
decayed teeth, make engagement rings
and for use in the arts, and to furnish
enouzh for the Keely cure, it did not leave
enough for use as money. The rest of his
remarks were devoted to advocacy of the
restoration of silver by the side of gold.
S EWALL MUST NOW RETIRE.
Populist* Believe Be should Make Way
for M'atÂ»on.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 15.â George F.
Washburne, chairman of the Western
brauch of the Populist National Com
mittee, wag interviewed by a reporter for
tbe United Associated Presses on the suc
cess of the Maine election and made the
following statement: "The results are just
what we expected. Maine is my native
State, and I know the sentiment there.
The vote has no more significance than
Arkansas' reply to Vermont, except to
emphasize how much of a burden tbe
Democracy has in its Vice-Preaidential
candidate."
"Do you think Mr. Sewall should with
diÂ»w?"
"'I certainly do, and the State of Maine
also saj s so. I agree with Tom Reed that
'Sewall's star sinks aud Watson's rises.'
The voice of Maine does not indic&te any
mismanagement of tbe campaign. It is
no test of Bryan's popularity or even of
the silver issue. No special effort was
made in Maine, except by tbe Republi
cans. Senator Jones and Senator Butler
have shown remarkable ability in the
management of the National campaign,
considering the limited means at the
command of both. The rapid flank move
ments of these generals in concentrating
their fire has at times thrown the enemy
into consternation, but the question con
stantly arising between the two forces over
fusion matters impairs the work. We
should concentrate our efforts on the elec
tion of one ticket. If this could be done
success would be certain. There ia an un
der-current of feeling which pervades the
Nation in support of t:ie claims of Mr.
Watson and his friends that he should be
recognised. There is force in the state
ment that 'Mr. Sewall is no more our can
didate than i; Mr. Hobaft.' There is also
significance in tbe attitude of the 'middle
of-the-road' men, who say that 'No Wat
son means no Bryan.'
"I know that these men, as well as the
Republicans have accumulated a mass of
evidence against Mr. Sewall which they
intend to make public and which may
force the Democratic parly to a defense of
Mr. Sewall's record during tbe closing
days of the campaign, but bo long as tbe
issue can be kept Â«m silver, Mr. Bryan as
the standard bearer of the allied forces,
can keep the enemy on the run. Tv- Re
publicans realize this. Therefore, failing
to win on principle, I balievo their trump
card will be to show in doubtful States the
inconsistency of Mr. Sewall's record and
how much oi a misfit he is on the Demo
cratic ticket. It is possible for him to be
come the peer of the campaign by rising
above personal ambition and declaring
that the silver cause must win. If, on the
other hand, he insists on remaining on
the ticket and the attack on him should
result in Bryan's defeat, he would be held
responsible by an indignant people and
would be scorned and hated as the most
unpopular man in America.
"Mr. feewall cannot be forced off the
ticket. It would be better for him to re
main on than to retire in any way that
would do his party injury. The Maine
election is over, he has demonstrated his
weakness. His party vote in his own
ward was only about one-half what it was
four years ago. He has contended four
times for election as Alderman and has
been defeated twice, the last time by a
ship-joiner, who polled 121 votes to hi 6 78.
I understand, further, that Mr. Sewall at
tended tbe June convention of his party
in his State, which nominated Mr. Wins
low, a gold Democrat, on a gold platform,
and though Mr. Sewail was there he
offered no objection to platform or ticket
and seemingly acquiesced in the nomina
tion of the candidates, aud in the adoption
of tbe platform, which wasbyaeclarhation.
"Wa have bad bard work to restrain
oar people up to the present time an i the
Kravity of the situation has not dawned
on the Democratio leaders. Tbe crisis is
at hand and I trust a way will be found to
unite aii tbe reform forces upon two can
didates representing both sides to resist
the combined forces of the Cleveland Re
publicans and the McKinley Democrats.
The only way to unite is for the Demo
crats to take our man."
TALKS AGAINST GOLD
Mr. Watton AUo Pays Bit Compliments

WAHOO, Nsbb.. Sept. 15.â Hon. Thomas
Wat,Â«on, with Governor Holcomb and
Congressman Bell of Colorado, visited
this city to-day. Notwithstanding a rain
which made country roads a literal ni.re
the sturdy farn.ers of Baunders and sur
rounding counties came ia by train and
wagon to hear the speeches anl partici
pate in the demon-tration. A bras* band
headed i wo Bryan clubs, which me; the dis
tinguished visitor at 10 o'clock. The mem
bers of the party were taken in carriages
to the Commercial Hotel, where an in
formal reception w is heid.
Later the party was escorted to tbe
Courthouse grove, where Governor Hol
comb of Nebraska introduced Mr. Wat
son. Just before he was introduced one
of tbe bands played "Marching Through
Georgia.' 1
Mr. Watson described Sherman's march
to the sea and said that Georgia, as well
as the entire South, was laboring under
the appalling curse of tbe gold standard,
which he denominated as causing more
misery in the South than the whole war.
He vividly depicted three classes of
slavery. The first, he said, was composed
of those born in slavery; tbe second, of
those sold into slavery, and the third the
class which had been placed in slavery by
unjust law.
Mr. Watson made a very vigorous at
tack upon Vice-Presidential Candidate
Sewal), which was well received by the
Populists, but Democrats think tne attack
uncalled for. At the conclusion of Mr.
Watson's address the audience was ad
dressed by Governor Holcon.b and Con
gressman Bell.
BILL YET AT THE SELM.
New lork Democrat* to Jin Asked to Put
Throunh Bis Slate.
BUFFALO, N. V., Sept. 15â Free silver
will dominate the Democratio Convention
to-morrow. Candidates, State issues and
all other questions will be relegated to
second place. The platform will deter
mine the ticket. The extreme BilveriteÂ»
hope to out-Chicago the Chicago platform
and thus prevent tbe nomination of a
conservative Democrat for Governor.
This will be offered by the leaders, who
desire above all things to prevent a split
and the nomination of a second State
Democratic ticket. Chief among those
leaders is Senator Hill, who will not be
here, but whose influence will be felt. All
talk of tbe abandonment of the party to
its fate by the senior Senator is nonsense.
He has active lieutenants on the field,
and the long-distance telephone is part of
the State machine. Whether Senator Hill
and the old leaders can control the, con
vention or not is a question that the con
vention will determine. A slate has been
made, and if it is put through it will be
plainly apparent that Senator Hill is still
at the helm. Here is the mate: '
For Governor, John Boyd Thatcher of
Albany; for Lieutenant-Governor, Gen
eral Isaac Catlin of Kinsrs; for Judge of
the Court of Appeals, Irving G. Vant of
Onondagua; for chairman of the State
Committee, Elliott Danforth: for member
of the National Committee. Frank Camp
bell; for temporary chairman of the con
vention, Thomas F. Gravy of New York;
for permanent chairman, ex-Cougressman
H. H. Rockwell of Chemungr.
Tbe platform, which has been shown to
Senator Hill and approved by him in Us
references to State issues, and by Chair
man James K. Jones of the Democratio
National Committee in its attitude, on
National questions, will indorse Bryan
and Se'vall, declare for free and unlimited
coinage of silver, denounce trusts and cor
porations, condemn bond issnes in time
of peace, and denounce the Barnes law,
the last Republican Legislature and Ke
publicsn extravagance in general. If this
platform can be put through and Thatcher
and Catlin nominated it is believed that
the party can be held together and tbe
placing of a ticket in the field by tbe
"ship" Democracy prevented.
If, however, the extreme silver men suc
ceed in their avowed programme ot in
dorsing every ulank of the Chicago plat
form, including that referring to the in
come tax, a more pronounced silver man
than Thatcher will be nominated and the
Shepherd Democrats will be challenged
to run an opposition ticket.
The friends of William Sulzer and other
extreme advocates of tbe Chicago platform
are bending all energies to accomplish this
result. A platform representing their
views has been prepared by their friends
and a strong effort to force its adoption
will be made. Should they succeed, the
slate will go to smash and the field will be
open for all otlier candidates.
It' the machine wins the name of Gen
eral I-aac Catlin for L.eutenant-Governnr
may be replaced by that of Edward M.
Grout or some other Kings County man.
It is generally conceded that Kings Coun
ty is to have the second place. There is
still plenty of talk of James W. Ridge
way. Ex-Senator Charles P. McClelland
of Westchester is out of the race and de-
Clares that he never was a candidate.
Elliott Danforth was elected a member
of the State Committee from the Twenty
sixth District to-day and will be selected
as chairman of the committee to succeed
B. W. Hinckley, who will resign after per
forming his duty of calling the conven
tion to order.
It was decided this evening that ex-
Congressnian Hosea H. Rockwell, an orig
inal silver man, who voted for silver in
Congress two years ago, snould be perma
nent chairman.
The State committee met this evening,
but transacted only routine business
mapped out by the leaders.
There were conferences late to-night, at
which most of the influential men here
were present and the work of the conven
tion was blocked out, but no man can say
to-night whether the convention will fol
low the orders of the leaders or run itself.
CONNECTICUT DEMOCRATS.
The Silver Element Will Cnntrol the Mew
Jlnren Convrntion.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Sept. 15.â The
â¢silver element in the Democratic party in
Connecticut has carried tbe day and will
have undisputed control of tbe convention
to-morrow. ,
Tha State Committee met this after
noon. The question of a temporary chair
man of the convention came up at once.
Horace Taft of Watertown was named by
Mr. Davis for the jjoid men, and William
Kennedy of Naugaiuck by the silver ele
ment. Tne latter nentteman was chosen
by a vote of 10 to 7. Chairman Davia at
once announced thift as he s"env.d to be
out of sympathy with the majority of the
committee he would withdraw to-morrow,
as has been stated.
Fred J. Brown of Waterbury, a member
of tbe committee and its secretary, an
nounced that he, too, would resign. Mel
bert B. Carey of Ridgetield and R. B. May
of Ansonia will take similar action. Tbe
names of the other members to resign
cannot be ascertained to-nieht.
In the light for control of the conven
tion candidates for places on the ticket
have been lost fight of, but the ticket will
probably be as follows: For Governor,
JooÂ«>ph B. Sargent, New Haven; Lienten
ant-Governor, S. A. Crandall, Norwich;
Secretary of State, S. A. Gowdy, Bristol;
Treasurer, A. P. Dowe, Danielsou; Comp

tional Committee, bad occasion tltis after
noon to deny another story from the South
relative to the alleged fusion between the
Republicans, Democrats and Populists in
Texas.
"You may say for me," laid the chair
man, "that there will be no fusion any
where between the Populists and thÂ« Re
publicans oa the electoral ticket. We do
not propose to aid in any possible manner
tbe election of electors pledged to the gold
standard, and all stories to that effect are
products of the imagination."
Mr. Butler had two short conferences to
day with Senators Teller and Dubois over
the situation in the West, and stated this
evening that good progress has been
made; that where friction had existed it
was probable that it would be removed,
I and that a thorough understanding would
be reached between all the parlies inter
ested In bringing about the election of Mr.
Bryan. When pressed for particulars with
regard to the State of Idaho and one or two
of the' Southern States where there ap
peared up to this time to have been a
hitch, Mr. Butler declined to give them.
Senators Teller and Dubois had another
talk with Chairman Jones this evening,
but it related entirely to the details of the
campaign. Senator Dubois, after a tour
of the Pacific Coast States, will return
later on to Illinois and make several
speeches. He leaves for the West to
morrow. Senator Jones starts for Chicago
to-night. He is satisfied with the result
of his visit to New York and this city, and
says thai he goes back to Chicago satisfied
with the condition of the campaign and
more thoroughly convinced than ever that
Bryan will be elected. Sper.king of the
election in Maine, he said it was far from
discouraging to the Democrats; on the
contrary, all the circumstancs consid
ered, it was quite encouraging. There
was a marked increase in the total Demo
cratic vote and a 'very considerable in
crease in the free silver vote in that State,
where it had been claimed at the outset
there was no silver Bentiment whatever.
If this ratio should be maintained in all
the States, as he believed it would be, the
election of Bryan would result with an
enormous majority of the popular vote
and a large proportion of the State elec
toral votes.
"NO WATSON, NO BRYAN,"
That Is the Spirit of Illinois Middle-of-
the- Road Populists.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 15.â"Middle-of
the-road" Popuiists of Illinois, who repu
diated the Springfield convention of the
fusion wing, held a turbulent convention
to-day, lasting until midnight, and nomi
nated a State ticket, with the exception of
Governor, which was purposely left vacant
because a majoiity of the delegates did not
want to put up a man against Governor
Altgeld. A fierce fight was made at the
night session, which frequently assumed
the acpect of a physical contest, the anti-
Altgeld delegates stubbornly resisting the
determination of the majority not to al
low Henry D. Lloyd, who had been slated
for Governor, to be put at the head of the
ticket to endanger the cause of Bryan,
Alttreld and frÂ«*e silver.
The ticket nominated was as follows:
Lieutenant-Governor, Henry D. Lloyd,
Chicago; Secretary of State. L. A. Quel
maz, Belleville; State Auditor, Grant
Dunbar, La Salle County; Attorney-Gen
eral, D. I. Durdick, Chicago ; Treasurer.
Joseph Schwerzen. Chicago; Trustee of
the University of Illinois, Mrs. Fanny C.
Kavanaugh, Chicago.
Tbe resolutions adopted indorsed the
platform and nomination of the St. Louis
convention in nominating Watson and
"most emphatically denounced any action
which prevents the Populists of any State
from exercising the privilege of casting
their ballots for him."
A bitter anti-Sewall spirit was manifested
and every delegate wore a badge inscribed
'"No Watson, no Bryan."

SHIP IN FLAMES AT SEA,
Thrilling Spectacle Reported by
Two Vessels Arriving at
New York.
Believed to Be tne State of Maine,
Coal Oil Ladenâ Her Life
boats G^ne.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 15.â Reports
made by three vessels that arrived yester
day arouse the gravest fears that the three
masted ship State of Maine, that left
here on September 4 with a cargo of coal
oil for Shanghai, has been burne.l at sea,
and that all on board, some twenty-six
men, have perished.
The sieamer Adria, from Port Antonio,
reported that about 240 miles nonh of
Hatteras, on September 9, she sighted a
burning ship which had evidently been
abandoned. Her deckhouse was on tire
and the flames were shooting up through
her hatches. All tier lifeboats were mis
sine, indicating that her crew bad taken
refuge in them.
The Norwegian bark Viva, which re
turned to this port yesterday, disabled by
a hurricane, lighted the binning craft on
September 11th, about 200 miles east by
scutheastof t!ie Hook.
The only oil-laden vessels besides the
State of Maine, which have of late left this
port, have been the Indiana and the
Nemesis, which sailed on August 14 for
China.
The Stata of Maine, Captain A. D. D.
Nickels, carr cci 56,500 oases of oil for the
the Standard Oil Company. She was a
wooden ship of about 1500 tons, built at
Damariscotta, Me., in 1873.
Ths State of Maine is well known along
the Pacific Coast. She has been to San
Francisco a number of times. She held
the record between Shanghai and New
York. The captain was a part owner in

When Yel'ow Metal Money Is De

t
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 15.âSecre
retary Carlisle, from his summer retreat in
Bar Harbor, Me., has addressed to one of
his Kentucky correspondents the following
ietter, which is this day made public:
Jamei P. Helm, Louisvilleâ blY Deab Bib:
Your letter asking how the silver dollars
whicu contain a quantity of bullion commer
cially worth only about 53 cents are main
tained at a parity with gold, notwithstanding
tbe fact that the Government does not directly
redeem them or the certificates issued upon
them in gold, is received, and as a great many
inquiries upon the name subject are addressed
to me daily from different parts of tbe country
"which ie ia impracticable to answer in detail
I will take advantage ot your favor to anÂ«wer
them all at once.
All the standard silver dollars issued from
mint* since the passage of the act of 1878, now
amounting to more than $433,000,000, have
been coined on public account from bullion
purchased by the Government, and are legal
tender in payment of all debts public and pri
vate, without regard to the amount, except
when otherwise expressly stipulated in the
contract between the parties. They belong to
the Government when coined, and they are
paid out by the Government at a parity with
gold for property and services of all kinds, and
received from the people at a parity with gold
in the payment of all dues and demands. The
Government has made no discrimination what
ever between the coins of the two metals, gold
having been paid on iv coin obligations when
gold was demanded, and silver having been
paid when silver was demanded.
Under this policy the coinage has been so
limited bylaw and the policy of the Treasury
Department that the amount coined has not
become so great as to drive the more valuable
coin â gold â out of the country and thus de
stroy the Dasis of our monetary system; and
so long as the two metals are of unequal com
mercial value at the ratio established by law
this limitation upon the coinage is, in my
opinion, absolutely essential to the mainte
nance ot' their parity in effecting exchanges.
It constitutes the principal safeguard for the
protection of currency againut the deprecia
tion which tbe experience of all countries has
shown would otherwise result iv the attempt
to use two legal tender coins of the same de
nomination but of unequal value. If the
limitation were removed confidence in tbe
ability of the Government to preserve equality
in the exchangeable value of the coins would
be destroyed and the parity would be lost long
before the amount ot silver coinage had be
come really excessive.
With free and unlimited coinage of silver
on account of private individuals and corpor
ations, the Government would be under no
moral obligation to maintain the parity, and,
moreover, it would be unable to do so. because
the volume of overvalued silver forced into
circulation by a legal tender provision would
6Oon expel gold from the country, or put such
a premium upon it thai it would be impossible
to procure and hold In the treasury a sufficient
amount to provide for the redemption of
silver on presentation. In order to maintain
the parity under such conditions the Govern
ment would be compelled from the beginning
to exchange gold for silver dollars and their
paper representatives whenever demanded,
just as it now exchanges gold for Us own notes
when demanded; and as the coinage ot silver
dollars would be unlimited and therefore
constantly increasing a point would goon be
reached where it would be impossible. to con
tinue the process of redemption. The implied
obligation of the Government to preserve the
value of money which it coins from its own
bullion aud for its own use and which it forces
its citizens to receive in exchange lor their
property and service has been supplemented
by two statutory declarations, which sub
stantially pledge the public faith to the main
tenance of tnatpolicy.
The act of J^P 14. 1890, after providing that
the Secretary of the Treasury should, under
such regulations as he might prescribe, re
deem the treasury notes issued In the pur
chase of silver bullion in gold or silver, at his
discretion, declares that it is "the established
policy of the United States to maintain the
two metals on a parity with each other upon
the present legal ratio, or such ratio as may be
provided by law," and the act of November 1,
1393. again declares It to be "the policy of the
United States to continue the use of both gold
and silver aa standard money and to coin both
gold and silver into money of equal intrinsic
and exchangeable value, such quality to be
secured through international agreement, or
bf suca safeguards of legislation as will In
sure the maintenance of the parity of the value
of the coins of the two metals and the equal
power of every dollar at all times in the mar
itetg in the payment of debts.
With knowledge of these assurances the
people have received these coins and have re
lied confidently upon the good faith of their
Government, and the confidence thus in
spired has been a most potent factor in the
maintenance of the parity. The public has
been satisfied that so long as nur present mon
etary system Is preserved the Government will
do whatever its moral oblijrations and express
declarations require It to do. and very Uricl v
as a consequence of this confidence in the
good faith in^ne executive authorities thn
silver coins hWe not depredated I in . valul it
is not doubted that whatever can be fiwfully
done to maimaln equality in the exehan^,.
able vfllua of the two metals wii be dona
whenever it becomes m.cessary, and although
silver dollars and stiver certificates have nÂ«v
up to tlie present time been received in ex
change for gold, yet if the time sha'l pver
come when the parity cannot be otherwise
maintained such exchange will be made
It is the duty of the Secretary of the Trpaa.
ury and of all other public officials to. executa
in good faith the policy declared by Conerp<iÂ«
and whenever he shall be satisfied that r.Â«
silver dollar cannot be kept equal in purchftÂ«
Ing power with the gold dollar except b v rt*
ceiving it in exchange for the gold dolar wh*m
such exchange is demanded, it will bt h!s dnt^
to adopt ihat course. But if our present'pol cv
is adhered to ana the coinage is kern w rhii

Three Victims of Sunday's
Bridge Disaster Are
Buried.
SIX DEATHS RECORDED.
Engineer George Burke Succumbs
to the Injuries He
Rece ved.
JURORS CENSURE THE COMPANY
Declare the Accident Was Due to the
Unsafe Ccndition of the
Timbers.
EUREKA, Cal.. Sept. 15.â This was a '
day of sorrow in Arcata. Three of those
killed in Sunday's bridge disaster were
buried. Flags were at half-mast; grief
was written on every face.
The funeral of Miss Annie Holland took
place this morning from the residence of
Mrs. C. C. Richard?. From a radius of
thirty miles large numbers of sorrowing
friends came to attend the last earthly
Bervice? for the departed. The funeral
procession was several blocks in length.
Tbe demand was so great that not a rig of
any kind could be procured this morning
at any of the liveries in Eureka, Arcata,
Bine Lake or Korbel. Mi:-3 Holland was
widely known and beloved by all her ac
quaintances. It would seem thai she was
predestined to die in a railroad calamity.
Slie was on tbe traiu wl-ich collided with
the Vance construction train a few montns
ago, and had been visiting in Arcata since
that time. When the day for her depar
ture arrived she became depressed, and
expressed her reluctance at going, saying:
''Something forewarns me that I am going
to be killed."
When pressed to remain she said she
was expected at home and must co. She
would i;avegotoff at Riverside, and was
but one mile from home when the mishap
occurred. Her brother was coming in a
buggy to meet her when he learned of the
nccident. When he astced the names of
those killed the first one he heard was that
of his sister.
The second victim, Brafceman Alexander
Cameron, was buried under the auspices
of the Odd Fellows and Knights of Pythias
lodges, and the funeral of Miss Ada Kirk
ham took place tnis afternoon from the
residence of O. K. Spring. Both were well
attended. Clausa and Sophia, children of
David Wood, and Engineer George Burke,
who died from his injuries this morning,
will be interred to-morrow. The schools
of Arcata will be closed to allow the pupils
to attend the funeral of the Wood chil
dren. They will be buried together from j
tbe residence of I. Minor Br.
Mrs. Wood is just beginning to realize
the terrible death of her children. Mrs.
Cameron cannot be comforted, and fears |
for her life are entertained. Relatives of j
Miss Holland bear their grief with more
composure.
Concerning the widely circulated r&port
that the chief engineer had frequently
warned the company that the bridge was '
unsafe and liable to collapse at any time, j
Anton Korbel, one of the owners, said this
morning:
"No one has ever intimated to me that
the bridge was insecure. I have always j
considered it the safest part of the road, j
From time to time I have had the struc- !
ture inspected. Three weeks ago our mill- j
wright gave the bridge a thorough going |
over. Only two hours before the disaster !
Superir tendent Zaruba and myseif ciose.y
examined it. Do you suppose for a moment i
that if I suspected that tbe bridge was '
dangerous I would allow my family to con- i
tinually cross it? My two nieces, the
Misses Vintera, were aboard the ill-fated
train. Their injuries are painful, but I
they will recover. It was my intention to !
return on the train with them. A broken â¢
piece of machinery, which I had to attend :
to, kept me over.
"That bridge cost our company $20,000. \
It was guaranteed to las>t for ten years, |
allowing a 30-ton locomotive to run thirty j
miles an hour over it. Tae wrecked train i
didn't weigh more than twenty-five tons '
and was running only six miles an hour." \
When asked what caused the coflapse |
he answered: "There is no doubt in my .
mind that the engine jumped the track I
and cut the needle beam with the wheels, i
Indications all point that way. Marks ;
where the ed<_'e of the wheel scraped the
rails can be seen, and the needle-beam is '
cut as clean as a whittle. When the nee- â¢
die-beam was severed there was nothing !
to support that bent of the bridge and it ;
collapsed."
Mr. Korbel looks careworn and troubled, j
He did not care to talk a great deal on the
subject. In the Arcaia sectiou feeling is <
Btrone and bitter against the company, j
People believe that if proper precautions i
had been taken the accident would not i
have occurred. This sentiment is nowhere '
more noticeable than at the company's !
works at Korbel. Tlie bereaved and their I
friends do not feel like making excuses for I
the affair.
The testimony at the inquest to-day has i
not helped matters. or tbe company. The I
inqu> st was held before Deputy Coroner j
dkinner and nine jurors. District Attor- I
ney >urnell appeared for the people and i
S. Al. Buck represented Korbel Bros.,
owners of the road.
Martha Ball was hunting for eggs w en
she saw the train sink through the bridge. !
She said it went down like a knife cutting .'
through butter. Clara .Hal! and Martha j
Logan also saw the train fall. A. Kirk- â 
Patrick, section foreman, examined the
bridge on Saturday, but did not bore any
holes to see the condition of the limbers.
M. H. Mider, the bridge superintendent. !
bored some holes, but none in the needle- !
beams which gave away. General Simer- j
itnendent Zarub:* claims he has snared no j
pains or expense to keep thine* in order, i
and he believes the bridge was in eood
condition. Grant Warren was in a box
cur and believes it was off the track at
the time of thedis-ister.
The strongest witness against the com
pany was Fireman Henry Burke. He
swore the locomotive never left the track
and the trestle must have dropped from I
under the train. There was no warning;
all was so sudden that he bad no lime to
move.
After a few moments deliberation and
careful inspection of tbe decayed timbers
the jury found that the cause of the acci
dent was the breaking ot the needle
beams. It further found that ttie break
age was 'iue to the decayed and unsaie j
conditinn of the bridce timbers. Several j
jurors were in favor of attributing the dis- i
aster to criminal lies itrence.
WATER FOR EUSENADA.
Xorel fichemr to Siiprl'i the. Lower Cali
f.,r in Al'lropoH*.
SAN DIEGO, Call, Be*>t. 15.â A novel
system o waer works is to be constructed
at Ensenada. Tbrooxn the advice of
Governor Sanginez, 100 soldiers will be put
at work ai once laying pipes and con
structing a system to extend from a point
in the San Antonio range, six mites north
east of the town, to the city, conveying
water by uravity to all parts of the plain
where the town is situated. An engineer
from the City of Mexico examinee' iue
mans an i asserts ihm 2<X> inches ot water
can be developed with sufficient pressure
to carry tue water over the bluff of Itur
bidf\ The diverting dam in the moun
tains requires a minimum of labor, as the
boulders form a natural reservoir.
The idea of Governor Sangsnez is to have
free water after tue expense of construction
is paid and the interest and sinking fund
wiped out. The piping for the system is
ain-ady ordered. With the free labor of
100 soldiers available under the direction
of one of the country's best engineers,
Enaenada expects to have an abundance
of water in a few months. The residents
of the town will be required only to pay
tor the connections with the mains.
BODEGA'S CELEBRATION.
Swiss Residents of Sonoma Observe the
Anniversary of Their Mother Coun
try's Independence.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 15.â The
Swiss celebration at Fern Grove, Bodega,
to-day was in every way a grand success.
From early dawn all the roads leading to
Bodega were crowded by Swiss people and
their friends, intent upon celebrating the
589 th anniversary of their mother coun
try's independence. A heavy shower dur
ing the night laid the dust and freshened
the air, and a more balm v and delightful
day could not have been wished for.
The literary exercises commenced at 11
o'clock with a short address by George j
I Adami, president of the day. Hon. Frank \
j J. Murphy delivered an eloquent address j
i in English, replete with historical facts.
I He was followed by Dr. Henry J. Sartori
of San Francisco, who spoke in the Italian
! tongue. Ail tbe addresses received close
lat ention and hearty applause. The
! musical part of tbe programme consisted
I of selections by the band and National
I songs.
Then there came a banquet beneath the
; shade of the spreading trees, and toasts to
the mother country and tne land of the
j stars and stripes were enthusiastically ap
plauded.
In tbe afternoon there were athletic
games for both old and young, under the
supervision of P. Pelasco and B. Spadini,
I masters of sports. There were races for
| boys and girls, young ladies and old men,
the winners receiving handsome prizes.
Several athletic youne men attempted the
feat of climbing the greasy pole, and all
hands turned out to head "off an exceed
ingly elusive porker, which had been
made slippery for the occasion. Tbe rest
of the afternoon was spent by the young
people on the dancing platform, while the
older generation looked on or strolled be
neath the trees.
To-night there was a ball in the school
house, which concluded the day's enjoy
ment.
FAST BOATS TO STOCKTON
California Navigation Company
Planning to Improve Its
Service.
Side-Propeller Steamers That Can
Travel to Saa Francisco and
Back in a Day.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 15.â The board
of directors of the California Navigation
and Improvement Company will hold a
meeting on Friday to consider, among
other matters, the proposition to put on a
line of fast passenger boats between this
city and San Francisco.
The project was broached some time
j ago, bat it has nover been definitely de-
I cided upon by the board. Those members
j who conceived the idea and have been
j championing the measure were not able '
then to submit facts and figures sufficient
to form a basis for action, but at the meet
i ing next Friday the proposition will be
| presented in tangible shape.
Preliminary drafts have been prepared
i showing the design of a steamer which is
j guaranteed to niaKe twenty-two miles an
; hour. -This would reduce the time be
! tween Stockton and San Francisco to four
j hours and a half. The plans contemplate
j a side-wheeler 160 feet lonsr and 18 feet in
the beam. It has two decks, the lower of
which is fitted up with a dining-room and j
I a restaurant, refreshment places, etc., and i
! the upper with drawing and card roomÂ«.
i As the trip will occupy only fonr and a
j half hours there will be n<Â» need of state
j rocms except in case of sickness, and only
' four such apartments are provided for. I
j Only quick freight will be carried, so no
i provision is made for accommodating
! heavy cargoes. The boat as planned is
j strictly a passenger steamer, and if built
! it will be equipped with all the latest apÂ«
i pliances for the comfort of those aboard.
; Tbe furnishings will be rich, for no ex
; pense will be spared to make the vessel a
a model one.
i Tbe side-wheel pattern boat is selected
j for several reasons in preference to the
. propeller. In the first Place it iÂ» claimed j
; that more speed can be got out of a Â«!de
waeeler at a given draught. To obtain a
; Â«peed of twenty-two miles an hour out o;
| a propeller boat it would be necessary to
| give her con* derable more draught than
j in the case of the other type o vessel, and
j this would be a disadvantage in navigat
i ing shallow waters. In the second place
i a side-wheeler can get around the bends
t of tbe crooked San Joaqnin more easily I
.and quickly than a propeller could or a j
| stern-wheel boat, becau-e each wheel is i
i worked by a separate engine, and one '
j wheel can be stopped or reversed while !
| the other is revolving as before, thus |
i making it possible to swing the boat
j around as if on a pivot.
The only di advantage about the side
! wheel pattern lies in the fact that tbe '
wheels take up room, necessitating a cor
responding reduction in the width of th c
beam. But this decrease makes the boat
j speedier, so it is not altogether a loss.
j And besides, the extra room will not be
I needed as in the case of vessels now on
j the river, inasmuch as the latter have to
be provided with scores of staterooms.
I: has not yet been decided, of cor.rse,
how many boats are to be cons' ructed, if
j any. In all likelihood there would be at
j lea-t two to start in with. The bnatsconhl
j make a round trip every day, which would I
i make two boats out d lily.

RIVERSIDE CONTESTION
Dnlegatet Jiefeat JÂ»tÂ»t ruction* to Vote
for Senator' Verkine.
RIVERSIDE, Cal.. Sept, 15.â One of
the most enthusiastic Republican county
conventions ever held in this county was
that la this city to-day. Every precinct
in the county was represented, except a
couple of the remote small ones. The
convention was presided over by Hon. N.
C. Hudson ot Corona, a veteran Republi
can who has seen years of party i-erv cÂ» in
lowa. On taking his seat Chairman Hud
son delivered a ringing sueecb for McKin
ley and protection, which was wi.d y
cheered.
The convention worked harmoniously
until the question of instructing the As
sembly nominee to vote for Senator Per
kins was raised. The resolutions passed
indorsed, in strong terms, the work of
Senator Perkins and Congressman Bowers
at Washington, but went no further. Wil
liam Collier Esq., a warm friend of Per
kins, offered a minority report to the ef
fect that the convention instruct its nomi
nee for the Assembly to vote for Perkins
to succeed himselt. The reading of the re
port was the signal for the beginning of a
heated debate. John G. North, George
Frost and other leaders of the party
strenuously opposed the adoption of the
minority report, and the minority report
was defeated by a big majority. This
means that the Assemblyman from the
Seventy-seven; District will co to Sacra
mentc unpledged, as it is conceded that
the Republican candidate will have a
walk-over.
Tne convention nominated George H.
Dole of this city, who is a brother of Presi

After naming nine delegates to the joint
Senatorial convention of the Fortieth Dis

The Germans, it appears, will vote nearly
solidly for McKinley. One Rentieman, who
lives in Milwaukee, toid me that the city
would give the larsiest Republican majority,
in proportion to the population, of any city in
the Union. Good judges claim thut Wisconsin
will give 100,000 majorit' for V.cKiniey.
I think that Minnesota is now safe, though
beieve it the election had takvn place six
weeks ago Bryan would have carried it I was
in St. Paul about a week ago, and I learned
that nearly all the business men who were
Democrats were all right upon the money
question.
In la king with Mr. Upham of the First Na
tional Bank he s'a'ed that its deposit-- since
the Chicago convention had fallen off over
$1,000,000; that a great deal of the money
had been drawn out and laid away, to pro
vide against the cataatropne of Bryan's elec
tion.
It is claimed that there Is about $30,000,000
of Canadian money invested in tue United
States in carrying wheat, cotton and pork.
This has been wi hdrawn, and no etevxtor
company or wheat man can get any of that
money unless he gives a gold note with double
the usual security. Men hesitate to d" this,
for It eleclio is went wrong they would be
ruined. They, like the millers in Minnesota,
prefer to do smaller business upon what capi
tal they have-
I have usually sold my wheat at Seep Eye,
New Ulm ana Mankato. The millers this year
at these points will not take a cerload, as they
have not the money to pay for it. You can
imagine, from what I have written, how tight
the money market is. How are the tifcnks in
California? Are they not all for sound mon-y?
What is the opinion of cool heads in Califor
nia? Do they think MrKinley will carry the
State? Yours respectfully, C. D. Gii.fii.las.

St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 9, 1896.
Genttemen: There is a much easier feeling in
financial circles here than there has been for a

trip to the North and Minnesota, and I find the
co sditions there very favorable. Advices from
friends who are in a position to know the real
situation aside from any newspaper reports ln
d.cate th-' election of McKinley by an enor

The defection in this State from the Demo
crats on account of the silver platform is enor
mous. I believe- this defect on will run from
10 to 25 per cent. It certainly is not less than
10 prr cent as an average throughout the
St.- w-. und In this city it will prolwoiy run as
high as 25 p<T cent. All the Democratic buÂ»i

PORTLAND ROGUES
USE HYPNOTISM
Broker Bulkley Svengalied
and Robbed of His
Money.
THIEVERY UP TO DATE.
Paid a Fancy Price for What
He Believed to Be a
Diamond,
FINDS THAT IT IS WORTHLESS.
Declares He Was Under tbe Influence
of Occult Power During the
Transaction-
PORTLAND, Ob.. Sept. 15. -In the lat
ter part of June Daniel T. Bulkley came
to Portland from Seattle. He brought
with him $3500 in ready cash and estab
lished himself as a money broker, doing
business in a lawyer's office in the Cham
ber of Commerce. Shortly after coming
here he called on friends he had known on
the Sound. Amonn the visitors at their
home vÂ»ere two members of the Portland
Hypnotic Club, tvho, during their evening,
"mounted their hobby," which they dis
cussed very entertainingly.
Mr. BulKley became infatuated with the
subject of hypnotism. He was so ab
sorbed with it that when the two apostles
took their leave he accompanied them
down town. Before separating from bis
newly-made friends he requested them to
present his name for membership to ihe
club. That was the be^innin^ of tho
broker's subsequent trouble, the details oi
which he narrated to Detectives Cody and
Welsh to-day.
B'likley became a member of the Hyp
noiic Club on August 1. and soon there
after his two sponsors occasionally
dropped into his office, piving him "point
ers" to advance him in the science. But
the two young men wore actuated by a
sinister motive. Both being of herculean
frame and endowed with a superabund
ance of animal magetiÃin, they worked
upon Bulkley until he was absolutely in
their power.
"On the 20th of August," said Bulkley
to the detect yes, "the two men called on
roe and after talking to me a half hour or
so they showed me a wondrously beau i
ful diamond. lam a judge of stones
and this I considered the greatest gem I
ever beueld. One of the men claimed it
had been in his family ur ward of a cen
tury. His mother needed $800 to lorestuii
the foreclosure of a mortgage and author
ized him to hypothecate the -tone for that
sum. She was willing to pay 3 per cent a
month for the loan.
"I hadn't more than $780 in my safe just
then, but the owner ot the jewel was sat
isfied to take that. The d.aniond was de
posited in a tin box and sealed in my
pie>ence, and I afterward Diaced it in the
bunk Ido business with for safe keepintr.
The two men subsequently did not call on
me so frequently, and from some un
known cause I lost interest in the club
ana its object.
"Last Saturday I intuitively resolved to
look once again at the diamond, and to
my horror I discovered it to be not bins
but a worthless stone. Then I real. zed
tnat my two iriends had hypnotized mo
on the afternoon I was swindled out of
$780."
Mr. Bulkley added that he saw the two
men on Saturday, when they could not
help confessing to the bunco operation
conducted while they had their victim
under hypnotic influences. They prom
ised to make restitution before next Satur
day. In the meantime they are being
"shadowed" by Detectives VVelsb and
Cody, wno will not ailow them to get
away.

Runaway on the
Track.
PROMISE ME'S EXPLOIT
Fearless Ed Lafferty Injured in
Attempting to Check His
Horse,
FAVORITES FINISH IN FRONT
Flare Up, Gazelle and Our Boy Win
Their Respective Events
Easily.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 15.â An ex
citing accident that occurred during the
progress of the 2:17 pace, which happily
terminated with no very serious conse
quences for the chief actor, varied the
monotony of an otherwise dull and listless
day's racing at the track. The incident
that caused the vast crowd in the grand
stand to jump to their feet and be afflicted
with a temporary suspension of their
breathing powers was caused by a broken
rein and a brave and fearless driver's
attempt to stop his runaway horse.
Among the starters in the pace was
Promise Me, the musical-faced horse,
which races with a silver tube inserted in
niÃ throat. He is owned by La Siesta
ranch and is trained and handled by the
popular California reinsman, Ed Lafferty.
The big chestnut was unplaced in the first
two heats, but in the third exhibited more
speed, showing third to Our Boy and
Jennie Me, as the trio rounded the bend
into the backstretch. The pace was a hot
one and as the quarter was passed he left
his feet and about opposite the five and a
half furlong, pole it was apparent he had
got beyond control of bis driver. A second
later and a figure in red was seen to jump
from the bike and land squarely on the !
runaway horse's back, and it was apparent
that a break in the harness bad occurred.
To the horror of the spectators, Lafferty
was seen to slide off the horse, but in his
fall he managed to grasp the broken rein
and there he hung, with the furious ani
mal going at breakneck speed. As the
half poie was reached, the daring driver i
let go his grasp and fell prostrate on the
track. A conveyance was hurriedly sent
to picK him up, and as it passed the stand
witn Lafferty, pale as a ghost, sitting on
the back seat, the grand stand spectators
arose and cheered the plucky horseman.
An examination by a physician showed
no serious injuries, the fortunate driver
escaping with a severe shaking up, and
some slight abrasions. It was the most
sensational incident of the fair for years.
The horse was caught without doing any
damage to any of the other starters.
Flare Up, Gazelle and Our Boy captured
their respective races without much diffi- j
oulty, starting pronounced favorites in
the betting, and most of the layers of odds
had a slight crimp put into their bank
roils.
The first event called was a trotting
stake, valued at $550, for two-year-olds.
Oakwood Park stock farm's filly Flare Up,
a daughter of Charles Derby, had first call
in the betting at $20, with Majella bring
ing $8, and the lieid, consisting of Tele
phone and Ben Wiles, going for $3. The
first choice appeared for the first heat, |
minus hobbles, and broke repeatedly. She
finished outside the nag, but the distance
was waived. Majella, driven by "Jimmy"
Sullivan, captured the heat easily in 2:29,
with Ben Wilfces second. Majella now
ruled favorite, but when next Flare Up
came out she had hobbles on. and took
two neats without much difficulty in 2:22,
2:24}Â£. Majella, a came daughter of Will
Direct, showed lameness as she scored up
for the second heat, but piuckily stuck to

FOOTBALL AT STANFORD.
JVfitr flayer* Already Show Much Jtn- '
vrovement in 'ih*ir Work.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cau, Sept.
15. â As fast as they can be uniformed, the
football players are appearing on the grid
iron, and while most of the hew men han
dle the pigskin in a ragged manner, they
work with so much interest and conscien
ciousnes3 that they are already showing
improvement. Several of the old varsity
and second eleven men have not yet come
out for proctice because suits cannot be
supplied as fast as needed. There are
already some thirty-five suits out, but at
least fifty or sixty men want football para
pharnalia, from the- noseguard to ankle
supports. The management promises to
get everything needed as fast as possible.
| The proximity of inter-class games now is
makine all football player.i unusually
anxious to get out. The games are billed
to come off on the 19th, 23d and 26th inst.
The new gridiron has just been put into
shape and a light practice game will be
played on it to-morrow, though for two
[ nights past the players have been at work
upon it. The new field has been plowed,
harrowed, covered with straw to give it
| the proper spring and again harrowed.
This, it is claimed, will prevent the men
from getting hurt through falling and
will lessen the number of slight accidents
that might otherwise occur.
Just at present there is talk of giving
the first and second elevens a few short
trips to the towns in the neighborhood.
This would increase the interest of the
players in their work on the field. Mana
ger Brown says that both teams will go to
San Jose on October 3. Other trips have
not yet been arranged.

THE SAN JOSE TRAGEDY.
Witnesses Describe the Murder
of Crosetti and Miss
Feilner.
The Girl Was Slaia After Rebuking

SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 15.â The taking of
testimony in the tiial of Harvey Allender
for the murder of Miss Walburga Feiln^ r on
August 9 began this morning befcie Judj;e
Lorigan. On the day in question Allen
der met Mi>s Feilnerand Venanz Crosetti.
to whom the girl was enpased, and shot
and killed them both. Jealousy is sup
posed to have been the cause of the mur
oer. The courtroom was packed with
spectators all day, a large part of whom
were ladies. F;ve eye-witnesses to the
shooting were examined.
E. D. Stewart, a young man residing at
145 North Fifth street" was the first wit
ness put on by the prosecution. He said
he was at the Empire engine-house, just
across the street, when the shooting oc
curred. He saw Miss Feilnerand Venanz
Crosetti standing on the east sidewalk of
Third street, diagonally across from the
Empire engine-house. The defendant was
behind them. He saw the girl shake her
finger at the defendant and heard them
talking, but. did not know what was said.
She turned away as she withdrew her
hand from in front of defendant's face.
Allender then shot her. She reeled and
in a moment fell a few feet from where
she stood when shot. Crosetti grabbed at
Allender's hands. There was a brief
tussle and Allender shot him. He ran
across the street toward tue engine-hous-e.
The witness saw Allender draw the re
volver from his hip pocket.
John Kent, a fireman, told practically
the same story. He heard the three talk
ing and heara the girl say something in
broken English and German, but didnot
understand what was ?a^d. She took her
hand down after shaking her finger in All
ender's face. Then he saw Allender draw
the revolver, heard the girl scream and
saw and heard the shot.
D. W. Herrington, Mrs. A. Love and
other eye-witnesses toid practically the
same story.
The prosecution will finish its case to
morrow night.

J. G. Cooney of Santa Ciuz, grand senior

Dear Sisters and Friends: My sincere
prayera are with you for a kuccessiul council.
I trust all changes, amendments and additions
to the constitution, ritual and by-laws will be
closely considered, carc-fullv discussed and
cautiously adopted to God's honor and glory,
and our peace and happiness and the increased
urosperity of our society. I ofler you special
remarks resi>ectint; local branches, and while
not wishing red-tapeism, I tru^t proper parlia
mentary procedure will always receive most
careful atttntion.
Let the work of relief and distribution be
chared equally among the sifters even as our
dear Lord distributed the work and tlie honors
among his disciules. After you have used the
greatest care in the selection of your officers,
be loyal to them, support them in their direc
tions by your unity and harmony. Remember
honest criticism is truly beneficial.
I heartily approve the course of Pioneer
Brancn No. 1 of Oakland in establishing a lec
ture bureau. I hope to see this extended
through our State. The organization of a
Catholic Young Women's Hume is one much
favored by his Grace, our honored and be
loved Archbishop, and he will heartily join in
your efforts to establish the same.
And now, dear sisters, as to Del Mar, like the
man who had a wife of whom he never spoke,
remarking occasionally "She speaks for her
seli," I can truly say Del Mar speaks for ilself.
To you all, dear sifters In Christ, and to all
who lore Del Mar aÂ« I do, my desire and aspira
tions for Del Mar and its success are an old
and oft-repeated story. I urge upon you active
exertion to support the Cathoac Ladies' Aid
Society in its efforts to aid the board of trus
tees in their efforts to sustain Del M*r.
The society owes much, it is hard to say how
'much, to the manager of Del Mar, Miss Hilary,
for her honesty, industry, energy, economy
and unflagging efforts for our cause, as also
Miss Katie Earle, her aid. Our good friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Judge Lngan of Santa Cruz, and
the pastor of Santa Cruz, Father McNamee,
hold especially a warm corner in my heart lv
Paris and in your love in tar-away California.
Mny peace, health, happiness and prospsrity
be yours. May God's divine blessing rest over
you and his grace within you. Do not foruet
me in your prayers. Yours, lovingly.
Margaret Dkane,
Grand President Catholic Ladies' Aid Society.

TUBA COUNTY'S QUEER SUIT.
Prevent* a . Supervisor Mm Elrcling
Himself to a Shrievalty.
'â  MARYbVILLE, Cal., Sept. 15âInjunc
tion proceedings were commenced on
Thursday last against W. B. Atkinson,
chairman of the Board of Supervisors, to
prevent him from voting for himself in
the election of a Sheriff to succeed the late
8. E. Inlow. The restraining order sum
moned him to appear in court to-aay to
show cause why the injunction should not
be made permanent. Eastern decisions
are against him, and the court declared it
will be a void act for him to vote for him
self. There are five members in the board,
two of whom favor Atkinson and two Lee
Inlow, a son of the deceased Sheriff of
Yuba County. Atkinson had the deciding
vote, which he sou /lit to cast for himself.
His next move will probably be to resign
and have the Governor appoint a suc
cessor favorable to him.

ment to the court to the effect that the

FIESTA OF AGUA DULCE.
Miners, Mexicans and Indians
Join in a Carnival of
Sport.
Races, Wrestling, Shooting Matches
and Queer Dances to Amuse
the Spectators.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Sept. 15.â An Indian
runner of the Cocopah tribe arrived at
Campo this evening with letters from the
miners at Aqua Dulce and Jacalitos, ask
ing everybody along the border to go
down to Aqua Dulce aud join in the fiesta,
which began to-night and wiil last
through the week. The Cocopah, who
bears the euphonious name of Red Beans,
and who is famous as a runner, says that
all the Cocopah Indians from the Colorado
River and mountains have gathered at
Aqua Dulce and have a camp numbering
several hundred bucks. They took all
their best horses there and are getting
ready to bet everything tbey have on
races.
Running races for long distances be
tween Indians wili be on<s of the sports.
Red Beans and Steps on His Shirt, both of
the same tribe, have tested their powers
many times and seem to be perfectly
matched. They will run with a missive
to Governor Sangines at Ensenada, forty
miles from Aqua Dulce. and return. Red
Beans says ho can make the ninety miles
between suns.
The Mexican ranchers for mil^s around
have trotted out their funcy stock and will
put it up against the hardy mustangs of
the Indians. The miners have organized
a social club, and tbÂ» belles of the Coco
pahs and Santa Catarina tribes and Mexi
can settlements will be treated to a genu
ine cotillon by the scions of Eastern aris
tocracy who have drifted out into the
camps.
General Isidore CanaJo, chief of all the
Indians in the peninsula, with headquar
ters in Santa Catarina, has moved his
whole establishment to Aeua Dulce to
enjoy the fiesta to its fullest. He has over
fifty braves in his own immediate family,
all stalwart fellows, good runners, expert
deer-slayers and poor woodchoppers.
They have taken their dancing dress to
the gathering of the clans, and will treat
their white and dusky neighbors to sev
eral dances, the most interesting being
the turtle dance, which seems to be pe
culiar to them.
In Santa Catarina Valley, near General
j Isidore's canap, is a huge stone turtle,
I seeming to be of natural formation. The
j Indians have woven many legends about
it, including a story that the bad spirit
has a passage-way under the turtle lead
ing to the infernal regions. They say the
turtle moves at certain seasons of the year.
Their dance is calculated to scare the
devil, and it is always successful.
Shooting-matches with revolvers by ex
pert miners and Mexicans, knife-throwing
contents, chicken pulling, bareback rac
ing, dancing, feasting and all-round gayety
will fill the weeK.
The mtscal venders in the camp expect
to settle the financial question without
difficulty through increased patronage.
Saniago Verdugo and Timoteo Velasco,
wrestlers, have gone over from Sangre de
Cristo to show their skill. Both are fat.
like Japanese wrestlers, but are said to be
wonderfully active. .
The celebration to-morrow at Ensenada
of Mexican Independence day promises to
be very successful. Quite a large party of
excursionists went down to-night by
steamer to witness the festivities.

rooms shall remain in town or not uncer

SEATTLE GIRL'S PLAINT.
Nina Foley Persecuted by a Portland Ad-
venturess Who Claims fo Be
Her Mother.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 15.â Nina Foley.
a 16-year-old girl, earning her own living
in Seattle, who supposed her parents to
have been dead, is being persecuted by an
adventurous person here claiming to be
her mother. Recently a woman giving
her name as Mrs. John Caldwell called on
Nina and told the girl that she was her
long-lost and repentant mother. Mrs.
Caldwell sobbed a little for effect, and told
the girl that she would take her to Juneau.
Then Nina's mother introduced to her the
"diamond king" of Alaska," and told her
that this king was able to buy her pretty
dresses and give her diamonds by the
panful.
Instantly Nina divined what her snp
posed mother had In view. She applied
to the courts for protection, and asked to
have a guardian appointed, so that Mrs.
Calflwell, Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Foley, Mrs.
Ford and Mrs. Scott â the one and the
same â couid not control her against her
will.
In the examination in court Mrs. Cald
weil stated from the witness-stand that
Nina, "her daughter," was the child of
Hotel-keeper C. C. Scott, the proprietor of
the Oilman in Portland, in its day one of
best hotels in the Northwest. Scott, eight
years ago. committed suicide by jumping
from a fifth-story window to the pave
ment.
The court decided that Nina would not
have to leave Seattle with her supposed
mother.THE STABLEMAN
GETS THE WORKS
Rainey Has Junta Conven
tion Votes to Throw
at the Birds.
DR. RAGAN CHAIRMAN
A Policeman Threw Out the Only
McNab-Popper Delegate
Who Peeped.
EDDIE GRANEY BAN THINGS.
The Convention Slowly Effected Per
manent Organization, Adjourning
Until Friday.
Rainey's maiority in the Junta's muni
cipal convention, which began in Odd
Fel.'ows' Hall last night, was only 169.
C. A. Reynolds, the Rainey-Lanigan
candidate for temporary chairman, was
elected by 569 votes, to 204 for Eugene N.
Deuprey, the candidate of the combined
anti- Rainey strength, bossed by McNab
and Sullivan.
Rainey's triumph was so overwhelming
that but one anti- Raineyite peeped during
the entire evening, and he was thrown
out by a policeman.
From the time the Junta movement was
C A. Reynolds Recites Democratic
Family History.
born Gavin McNab has always been at the
front when anything was going on.
For about a year he has named chair
men and committees, and at every meet
ing of every sort Mr. McNab has occupied
a front seat, told tne chairman what to do,
bustled about steering his programme and
made speeches of force and frequency.
But nobody heard a word from Gavin
McNab last night. The time for the Junta
to really do something politically had
come, and it was not McNab'* meeting, it
was Eddie Greaney this time who hustled
about, steering the programme and telling
the chairman what to do.
McNab sat in a corner and kept still.
Chairman Sullivan called the convention
to order, iutroduced Rainey's chairman,
and then he, too, went to a corner and quit.
Max Popper, who didn't know before
hand whether Rainey was really the boss
or not, kept door at the start and then in
disgust let the "push" swarm in at its
will.
Popper got in a swipe at Rainey's chair
man with his vote once, but that was all
he bad to say.
If the vote had been close there would
have been lots of music in the air, but
Rainey's victory was so overwhelming
that the minority just gave up dazed and
quit, and the Raineyites had things their
own way so easily and completely that
they rather lost interest in the proceed
ings themselves.
But there was no boltâ not a bolt. All
those purity anti-boss lellows who ex
pected to run things themselves just took
tbeir medicine and said nothing.
The convention got no lurther than per-
These Needed No Credentials*
manent organization last night, electing
Dr. D. P. Ragan permanent chairman.
At 8:30 p. M. W. P. Sullivan, chairman
of the general and executive committees
of the organization, called the assemblage
to order and announced without remarks
that nominations for temporary chairman
were in order. _ â¢
AJtÂ«r a pause Attorney Joseph E. O'Don- ,
nell rose on the floor and spoke of "a
young man well known." When he men
tioned C. A Reynolds applause came from
the Rainey-LaniÂ»ran-anarchist element on
the floor and in the galleries
Osgood Putnam rose to put in the field
a X l?v â  He named the candidate of the
anti-Raineyites, Eugene N. Deuorey, the
mail who ruled that tumultuous Union
Mall convention of two years ago with a
hammer, a eteel plate, a loud voice and a
programme, and who appointed the Deu
prey committee, which cave birth to the
Junta a year and a half later.
"There are issues here to-night that are
the same as those of two years ago, though
in not so aggravated a form," said Mr.
Putnam, with Rainey's work in the last
municipal convention in his mind. "We
want a man of firmness and boldness, who
will stamp out, if need be, anything that
stands behind the rail."
Sam Braunhart Rubbed More Hair
From His Head*
This covert allusion to the "gang" won
a little applause from the anti-Raineyites,
as did the mention of Deuprey's name.
On motion nominations closed and roll
call on temporary chairman was ordered.
The decisive test of the convention was
at hand, and there was an immediate ten
sion of interest as Secretary McGovern be
gan in his loud, clear voice to call the roll
of 600 names.
There was first on the roll the batch of
twenty-four names comprising the ten
delegates at large apportioned by the hat
drawing, the seven named by Chairman
Sullivan and the seven named by Secre
tary John F. McGovern. Twelve of these
votes went to Deuprey and eight, includ
ing Secretary McGovern's went to Rey
nolds.
The Twenty-eighth District, where
Rainey controlled fourteen votes and Sec
retary McGovern of the "anarchists" con
trolled the rest, cast its vote solidly for
Reynolds.
In the Twenty-ninth Samuel Brannhart
was able to throw thirty-one votes to Deu
prey, one going to Reynolds.
Tne vote of the Thirty-first displayed
Campaign Committeeman George Love in
the middle of the Rainey camp. One vote
went to Deuprey and thirty-one to Rey
nolds, giving Reynolds 112 and Deuprey
62. The Raineyites howled in joy, although
the vote was no surprise to them.
The Thirty-third, controlled by John
O'Donnell, another "anarchist." gave 32
votes to Reynolds. The victory was plain,
the gang howled and the buried minority
sighed in despair.
The Thirty-fourth, where the delegation
w is divided between Rainey and Attorney
K. L. Mann of Congressman Maguire's
office, who is interested in the Legislature,
gave one lone vote 'o Deuprey. Mann's
knife went into McNab and Sullivan.
The Thirty-fifth gave its 35 votes for
Denprey. and James Butler's friend, A. C.
Freese, was seen to be out of tho race for
the nomination for Public Administrator.
The Thirty-sixth gave 11 votes to Deu
prey and 21 to Reynolds. When Max Pop-
James Denman Also Held His
Peace in Defeat.
per's name was called he shouted: "Mr.
Chairman, I desire to vote for a man wlio
has always been a Democratâ Eugene N.
Deuprey."
Howls arose at this stab at the Rainey
candidate, and a pugnacious Raineyite
shouted, "That'B more'n you've been."
Popper's remark was based on the fact
that Reynolds was nominated for Justice
of the Peace by the Populists two ytars ago.
However, at this stage Mr. Reynolds
had 205 votes and Mr. Deuprey enjoyed
the credit of 125.
As the rollcall went on, W. P. Sullivan,
Joseph M. Nougues, A. A. Wat Kins, G.
How ard Thompson, M. Greenblatt, Charles
Wesley Reed and ex-Senator H. C. Ges
ford voted for Deuprey.
The Thirty-ninth, controlled mainly by
Rainey and comprising a minority con
trolled by Campaign Committeeman Dr.
W. J. Gavigan, who will probably be
nominated for Police Ju Ige, cave its
thirty- two votes solidly to Reynolds.
When the Forty -second' was reached
Harry K. Wi?e announced 32 votes for
Reynolds. When the vote reached 328 to
157 Osgood Putnam moved that the rollcall
be suspended and that the nomination of
Mr. Reynolds be made unan mous.
There were cries of "No, no," and dv the
voice one of the proiests came from Max
Popper.
Chairman Sullivan said that every dele
gate had a ri^ht to have his vote recorded
on every important matter.
"There are some delegates who want
their votes recorded on this issue," added
Mr. Sullivan sarcastically.
The vote was announced to be 369 for
Reynolds and 204 for Deuprey. Mr. Rey
nolds was ejscorted to thp ch&ir and Mr.
Reynolds made a speech. He gave thanks
and then replieo. to Max Popper's thrust.
His lather was of Virginia, and every Rey
nolds had always been a Democrat. His
mother was of Tennessee and of genera
tions of Democracy, "and, gentlemen of
the convention, Mr. Popper's insinuation
notwithstanding, it seems to me that I

have a right to come before this conven
tion and say that I, too, am a Democrat.
"Gentlemen of the convention, the peo
ple of San Francisco are getting tirpd of
platitudes and of promises unfulfilled.
What the people of San Francisco want is
men, and the best platform you can pro
mulgate is a ticket of honest, straightfor
ward Democrats. I want to say that I
will recognize every faction in every dis
trict in the hope that in the future all
Democrats will face one way and be no
more opposed."
John F. McGovern declined the nomina
tion for temporary secretary and J. Saul-
man was elected.
On motion of George Gallagher the
chairman named a committee on creden
tials, and it turned out as follows:
P. D. Mullaney, P. Lydon, L. J. Hurley,
Joseph Goger, Jeremiah O'Leary, John
O'Donnell, Daniel O'Caliaghan, John H.
Grady, James H. Cahill, Thomas A. King,
Joseph A. Lynch, Joseph H. Farren, Wil
liam Ackerson, John Mahoney, J. J. Mc-
Gowan, William Abbott, V. de Andreas, J.
O'Hara Cosgrave.
An almost interminable recess followed,
and when Chairman Reynolds finally
called the meeting to order the only par
ticipation of the police in the proceedings
followed.
J. P. Devereaux, sergeant-at-arms of the
State Central Committee, and a delegate
were on the platform, itching to roast the
chairman and the whole Rainey outfit.
The chairman privately told Devereanz
to take his seat with his delegation, but
Devereaux proposed to go ahead with his
roast. The crowd, however, hooted so
loudly at the kicker on the platform that
ne didn't get a chance to say anything,
and amid the hooting a policeman, sent by
a Rainey lieutenant, jumped to the plat
form and ruthlessly grabbed Devereaux
by the collar and hustled him savagely
down the steps, down the isle and out into
the night.
Devereaux has been sergeant-at-arms of
the Junta headquarters and a humble
but faithful follower of McNab and Sulli
van, who hnve bossed things up there.
Whatever the merits of the case, his igno
minious chucking out of the convention
that Sam Rainey owns was a vivid illus
tration of the revolution that has pulled
down ana set up little political kings.
The chairman appointed as sergeants-at
arms J. J. Kennedy, George Cashel, John
McGuire, Joseph Byrne, George Bocher,
Joseph Given, John Brennen, E. M.
Dwyer.
The report of the committee on creden
tials was approved and the following corn-

At the end of another long recess J. A.
Spinetti. chairman of the committee, read
the report, which recommended Dr. D. F.
Ragan for permanent chairman, J. Saul
man for permanent secretary and L. F.
Byington for vice-chairman. Delegates
were to meet on the 22d inst. in Senatorial
and Assembly district convention to name
candidates for the Legislature which were
to be ratified by the convention. The or
der of nominations was fixed in the usual
way.
The report was adopted by a viva voce
vote. There was no tight left in the mi
nority.
Dr. Ragan came to the front and talked
of thanks, favorable auspices, W. J. Bryan
and the fairness he would show, and ob
served in reference to the convention :
"Friction is a law of nature and necessary
to progress. The more friction the more
progress."
The Raineyites cheered bim and then
Charles Wesley Reed caused another re
cess by moving- the appointment of a
committee of eighteen on platform and
resolution. After a while Harry Wise's
motion to make it twenty-five prevailed,
and the committee was finally announced
as follows:
Dr. T. A. Rottanzi, John Mannlx. P. M. De
lanty, John Kinsella, W. T. Colbert, J. T Le

THE BUCKLEY TICKET.
Registrar Hlnton Refused to File
Certificates of Nomination.
In response to the application oi J. C.
Nealon and W. T. Hawley to have the
nominees of the Buckley Democratic con
vention placed upon the ticket, Registrar
Hinton has penned the following reply:
To Messrs. J. C. Nealon and W. T. Hawleyâ
Gentlemen: I received to-day a document to
which your names are attached as chairman
and secretary respectively, entitled "Certifi
cate of Nomination of Candidates for Public
Office by a Convention Representing the Dem
ocratic Party of the City and County of San
Francisco, for the Year 1896." Mr. Thomas J.
Glynn and the gentlemen presenting this
document demanded that the Registrar file
the same.
I declined to file said document, because It
does not emanate from a "convention ropre
senting a political party which at the last
election before the holding of such conven
tion polled at least 3 per cent of the entire
vote of the â¢ â¢ â¢ county, city or other po
litical division for which the nomination was
made," as required by the Political Code, sec
tion L18b". Repectfully.
W. M. Hinton, Registrar.
William F. Humphrey has prepared a
writ of mandate to compel the Registrar
to file certificates of nomination, and this
will be presented to the Supreme Court
to-morrow morning.
The attorneys for Chris Buckley are W.
tr. Humphrey, P. F. Dunne, David Frieden

Rothchild.
EMMA A. ASHLEY'S TRIAL
" Lucky " Baldwin's Assailant
Brought to Bar Before
Judge Bahrs.
All Day Yesterday Consumed in Ob
taining Nine Jurors to Hear
the Cas\
The trial of Emma O. Ashley, who is
charged with assault to murder Â£. J. Bald
win, was begun yesterday in Judge Bahrs'
court. The defendant is a sister ol Lillian
A. Ashley, who is suing Baldwin for $75,
-000 damages for reduction.
Emma Ashley during the trial of her
sister's suit against the millionaire horse
man was a constant attendant in Judge
Slack's courtroom. She was of a religious
disposition and usually sat in the rear of
the room reading her Bible and apparently
paying little attention to the evidence.
On the morning of July 2, 1896, however,
while her sister was being cross-examined,
Emma Ashley suddenly took a pistol
fiom a small hand bag and approaching
Baldwin, as he sat with his back to her,
fired at his head.
The ball barely missed its intended vic
tim and buried itself in the opposite wall.
When taken to the City Prison the
young woman seemed demented and
wanted to stop on the way and pray. She
claimed to have been commanded by God
to kill her sister's enemy, but was other
wise unconcerned at her predicament.
Emma Ashley, Lillian Ashley and a
couple of female friends sac together ali
day in the courtroom yesterday listening
to the efforts of the wrangling attorneys
to secure a jury. Despite their best efforts,
however, but nine men had been secured
when the hour of adjournment arrived.
The case goes on to-morrow.
Following are the jurors already sworn
in: A. S. Perley, N. Davidson, J. C". Burke
L. Kragen, D. Curry, D. W, Pringle, L. G.
Flanagan, W. L. Groat, C. Meir.
GAVE BOND NOT TO PAY
Device by Which Ex- Attorney
Napthaly Tricked the
Police Courts.
Would Not Be Prosecuted for Perjury,
Because the Bail Bond Was
Defective.
Police Court Attorney B. F. Napthaly
has again slipped through the meshes of
the legal net. This time he was indicted
for perjury. Judge Troutt yesterday dis
missed the charge.
Almost two years ago Napthaly had a
client named Mills, to secure whose re
lease be signed a bond, swearing that he
(Napthaly) owned $1500 worth of furni
ture in storage. As it was proven that the
statement was false, the Grand Jury in
dicted the practitioner for perjury.
\\ hen the case came up for trial in
Judge Troutt's court yesterday, the bond
that Napthaly signed was introduced in
evidence. William D. Farren, (he clerk
in Judge Lowe's court, identitiea the pa
per as the one Napthaly bad affixed his
signiture to at Farren's house. Carroll
Cook, who represented the accused, then
took all the wind out of the prosecution's
sails by announcing that the bond bound
its signer "not to pay the State of Califor
nia the sum of $500" in case Mills did not
appear for trial.
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Hinkle
was astounded and Judge Troutt for an
instant did not know what to do. He then
asked for the document, and sure enough
there was the word "not" interlineated,
this making the bond completely inopera
tive.
As the document was defective of course
any sworn statement about it was imma
terial and the charge of perjury fell Hat.
Judge Troutt, therefore, dismissed the case.
Napthaly has been in trouble a num
ber of times, and Judge Slack disbarred
him long ago. He, however, is, for some
unknown reason, allowed to practice in
the Police Courts, with the exception of
Judge Low's department. He has no
right to do so, but an alleged political pull
is said to influence the other Judges in his
favor.
MRS. GERMAN'S DENIAL.
Says She WÂ»Â« Not Married Thirteen
Times and That HÂ«r Husband Has
Badly Mistreated Her.
Mrs. Esther German, who has been sued
for divorce by her husband and who
has been alleged by him to have been
married thirteen times, declares not only
that this but every other allegation made
by her husband is false. She says that she
was married three times, but the experi
ence she has had with her present hus
band has been such as to cause her to be
very careful how she marries again. She
declares that while she is eager to be free
from the ties that bind her to German she
will see to it that he does not get the di
vorce, as he has not only deserted but mal
treated her.
She says that so long as she supplied
him with money and kept him in wine all
went well in her household, but when she
ceased to do that trouble begun, bhe says
she was in business and doing well for
herself when she met and married Ger
man, since which time, however, she has
lost everything and all through him.
Free Cople* of the Charter.
The Citizens' Charter Association has just
had printed 20,000 copies of the new charter
in Its original form for public distribution.
Any person desiring one or more copies should
apply at the office of the Charter Association
in the Mills building, and they will be cheer
fully given or sent to him. Owing to the small
amount appropriated lor the Freeholders'
convention only 1000 copies of the charter
were published. For that reason these addi
tional 20,000 copies have been issued by the
Charter Association. By addressing a postal
to the association a copy will be sent to any
address without any charge. ,

IS NOW UNDER INVESTIGATION
Large Attendance of Union Iron Works
Employesâ lrish and Mexican
Celebrations.
The attendance at the Home Industry
Exposition at the Pavilion last evening
was indeed large. The 25 cents admission
has proved a success beyond all expecta
tions, as the number of visitors more
than makes up the difference between the
present and the old rate.
Last evenine it was estimated that fully
2000 employes of the Union Iron Worts
were at the exposition, and even this
number constituted less than half of the
attendance. The Union Iron Works em
ployesâand the public in general for that
matter â were received by Irving M. Scott,
who delivered the address of welcome.
The principal event of the evening was
the debate upon the new charter. There
was no decision rendered, as the debate
was purely of an educational nature.
A. P. Van Duzer, president of the Asso
ciated Improvement Clubs, and Henry H.
Clement, one of the freeholders "who
helped draw up the document, gave rea
sons why it should be adopted. P. J.
Healy and John M. Reynolds spoke
atrainst it.
The principal work of Judge Doolan was
to keep the speakers within the twenty
minutes allowed to each debater.
There is a well developed little tempest
in a teapot rumpus in one of the depart
ments in the Pavilion. For months it was
advertised that the affair would be a
strictly home-product exposition and that
no Eastern or foreign made goods or
products would be presented to the atten
tion of the public.
S. H. Taoy, manager of the Manufac
turers' ana Producers' Association of Cali
fornia, made the discovery that a St.
Joseph (Mo.) firm has a large booth in the
west end of the building where a Missouri
brand of pancake flour is being exhibited.
Of course Mr. Tacy raised a vigorous pro
test against the supposed intruder, ana he
was ably seconded by a goodly number of
local producers of flours and meals. An
investigation was made, and it is stated
that the Missouri firm has three carloads
of its flour on the way to this City for use
at the exposition. Two of these carloads
are said to be in Sacramento and the other
is at Fifth and Town-.end streets. The
protest resulted in the management of the
exposition appointing a committee to look
into the Missouri firm's pretensions to be a
local manufacturing concern.
Those who are raising the breeze say
that the Eastern man has given oruere to
local milieis for cornmeal, rye and the
other cereal components of its pancake
Hour in order to mix with the product of
tne St. Josepn mill. By so doing the hope
is that the flour will pass as a Calitornia
product and be permitted in the fair. Pend
ing a decision Aunt Jemima still holds
forth in the booth and disperses tooth
some pancakes to the public, much to the
annoyance of local millers.
This evening the anniversary of
Mexican independence will be com
memorated at the Pavilion. A number
of local mandolin clubs will render an
especial programme made up of Mexican
airs. The entertainment will be held in
the art gallery.
The Celtic Union will hold its first joint
celebration at the Pavilion to-morrow
evening. A musical programme made up
of national Irish and American airs will
be a feature of the entertainment.
Jeremiah Deasy, president of the union,
will have charge of the festival. The Hon.
Joseph Leg ett will deliver an address on
Irish manufactures and the past and
present and future commercial prosperity
of the Emerald Isle.
The result of voting for the most attrac
tive exhibits in the fair to last evening was

IRISH NIGHT ARRANGED
It Will Be a Time of Many Melo
dies at the Mechanics'
Pavilion.
The Celtic Union Is Encouraged and
Sees Signs of a Strong Central
Society.
At a meeting of the Celtic Union last
night Jeremiah Deasy, Charles B. Flanni
ean and J. H. Doolan, the committee on
the Mechanics' Institute, reported the 17th
would be celebrated as Irish night. "The
committee from the Pavilion did all in
its power to make it pleasant for us," said
Mr. Flanniean ana the evening will be de
voted to Irish "music."
Jeremiah Deasy will preside and Joseph
Leggeit will be orator of the evening. Di
vision No. 10 of the Hibernians will
march in a body from Hibernian Hall to
the Mechanics' Pavilion to meet other so
cieties, among them the Knights of the
Red Branch, Ancient Order of Hibernians,
Knights of St. Patrick and the Three
Counties' Societies, the Gaelic and Knights
of Tara.
Tne union feels encouraged at the pros
pect of consolidating every Irish f-ociety
in one body for the purpose of co-operat
ing on important matters and finally ef
fecting the completion of an arrangement
to build a central hall.
LODGING-HOUSE ROW.
It Results in Two Men Being Cut and
a Woman Getting Her Shoulder-
Blade Broken.
The lodging-house 742 Howard street,
kept by Mrs. Mary Ann Connelly, was the
scene of a lively fight last night, resulting
in the arrest of two men on charges of as
sault to murder and assault with a deadly
weapon.
John Cook, a cook, and his wife occupy
a room on the ground floor in the rear.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Cook met Jo
seph Cordes, a friend, and they had some
drinks together. They went to 742 How
ard street and Cook joined them in their
festivities.
About 7 o'clock Cook left and Mrs. Con
nelly and her daughter went into Cook's
room. They were all chatting together
when Cook jumped through the open
window, with a knife in his band, and
made for Cordes. Miss Connelly urged
Cordes to run and climb the fence, but lie
did not heed her advice. Cook and he
grappled with each other and a rough-and
tumble tight followed. When it was all
over Cook had six wounds in his scalp,
one penetrating to the skull; Cordes haa a
deep wound in his arm and Mrs. Connelly,
who was knocked down by Cook, had her
left siioulder-blade broken.
Their wounds were dressed at the Re
ceiving Hosnital. Cook was booked at
the City Prision for assault to murder and
assault with a deadly Weapon, and Cordes
with assault with a deadly weapon.
Mrs. Cook, who was considerably under
the influence of liquor, was arrested and
booked at the\ Southern station on the
charge of vagrancy.
ANOTHER "DAY OF AWE"
To-Day Is the Eve of Yom
Kippur, a Solemn Period
of Atonement.
Appropriate Services Will Be Held in
All the City Synagoguesâ Fast
ing Euj lined.
The most important and solemn of the
Hebrew "Days of Awe" will commence
with the setting of the sun this evening.
To-day is the eve of the Day of Atone
ment, whereon the pious Hebrew "af- '
flicts his soul" in accordance with the
Biblical injunction. For twenty-four j
hours, commencing at sunset this even
ing, till the same time to-morrow, not a
mouthful of food will be permitted to pass j
his lipa. It is in all respects the most
universally observed day of the whole
cycle of festivals and fasts.
Yom Kippur is the name by which the
Day of Atonement is known among
Israelites. It is observed by Hebrews in all
parts of the world and of all sections of
belief â radical, reform, conservative or
orthodoxâin the synagogue. The reli
gious and musical exercises are impressive
and are of such a character as to impress \
upon all the solemnity of the occasion.
Much of the old traditional form of ser- ;
â¼ice has been eliminated from the ritual
of modern American synagogues. This
has been brought about by reform which
rejects absolutely forms of worship con
ceived in Egypt, in Spain, in Babylonia !
and in Palestine. In orthodox places of j
worship, of which there are quite a num
ber in this City, the officiating ministers
are robed in white, emblematic of purity,
and even some of the attendant worship- i
ers are so attired.
Services will bo held this evenine at
Temple Emanu-El. Sherith Israel. Beth ;
Israel and Ohabai Shalame at 7 :45 o'clock.
To-morrow the exerc'ses will commence at '
10 a. m. and continue throuehout the day.
The fast will terminate at 5:30 P. M.
Druids' Banquet.
The Independent Order of Druids enjoyed a
supper last night at the Maison St. Germain.
The affair was strictly private, but perhaps
the more enjoyable for that very reason, as it
was thus rendered more homelike.

Judge Murphy yesterday granted a divorce
to Celine M.Durand from Leon Durand, because
of the latter's extreme cruelty.

A COLONY FOR MONTEREY
Settlement of Four Hundred
German Catholic Fami
lies.
What August Erz, Promoter of tht
Enterprise, Exp-cts to Accom
plish at Detroit.
To-day articles of Incorporation will be
filed looking to the establishment of a
large colony of German Catholics in Mon
terey County. A similar colony may be
formed in Mendocino County, but the
Monterey enterprise will first receive the
attention of the promoters.
The leading and progressive spirit Ir
the work is August Erz, a well-known
German writer and a business man of fine
attainments. He has been a contributor
to the columns of the California Volka
fruend, the German Catholic paper of San
Francisco, and is highly connected in the
East.
Mr. Erz will leave shortly for Detroit to
attend the German Catholic Congress to
be held in that city September 24. This
congress will be composed of delegates
from all the German Catholic benevolent
and fraternal societies of the United
States. He will go to Detroit to specially
promote the advancement of the proposed
colony in Monterey and will do able to
present facts which will surely enlist the
attention of the delegates. Already more
than a hundred letters of inquiry re
garding the colony have been received,
which fact alone indicates the widespread
interest in the enterprise.
The exact site of the colony cannot be
designated at present, but it is proposed
that land suitable to the production or
sugar beets be selected, as it is in
tended to make that industry one of the
principal features of the new settlement.
The associates of Mr.Erz are confident of
his ability to obtain substantial subscrip
tions at Detroit to advance the colony
project. Four hundred families will be
invited to settle on the tract of land.

BARON GOTTZHEIM SUED.
A Collector Is Anxious to Know All
About His Financial Affairs.
Twenty dollars, a simple double-eagle,
is all that stands between Baron MoritÂ»
Stoch yon Gottzheim and the humiliation
of having to appear before Justice of the
Peace Groezinger to tell of his worldly
possessions, and yet the probabilities are
that on Monday next the Baron will be
served with an order of examination.
Baron Moritz Stoch yon Gottzheim is a
German nobleman of the bluest blood,
who arrived in this City several years ago
with a magnificent wardrobe but not a
plethoric purse, and his career since land
ing nas been punctuated with legal pro
ceedings until it has come to a matter of
putting claims in the hands of collectors
before satisfaction can be obtained.
The Baron does not work to any marked
extent, but he runs up bills neverthsless,
and it is the indebtedness resulting from
the visits of a prominent doctor that has
brought on hit, most recent troubles.
The Baron was sick enough a few weeks
as*o to require a couple of days attendance
from a physician, and $20 was the fee
asked.

and PROSPERITY.
FOR PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM HcKIRLEY, or OHIO
fOB TICF-PKESIDENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EI.ECTION NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
The Union is going for McKiniey, and
California must go with the Union.
The Bryanite road has now tnrned to a
squirrel track, and very soon it will run
up a tree.
To teach the people political wisdom
this year did not need much in the way of
education after ail.
This country needs a protective tariff,
and the vote in Maine and Vermont shows
that the people know it.
It can scarcely be questioned that the
man who found the keenest delight in the
Maine vote was Tom Watson.
Tbe campaign of education is all one
way, as the Popocrats have concluded to
do more cussing than discussing.
The men who vote for Palmer and Buck
ner will be the last of the Democrats, and
they will deserve a respectful funeral.
Landslides are discounted thiÃ year, as
the whole United States seems to be mov
ing bodily for protection and sound money.
So far from wir.ninir votes in Maine for
his ticket the millionaire Sewall did not
even succeed in holding the Democrats in
line.
McKiniey always addresses the business
sense of the people, and that is one reason
why he is regarded as so different from
Bryan.
To-day the New York Democrats meet
and the question ia. Will they present a
statuesque appearance or will they make
a bust?
Tom Reed asked Maine to speak in a
loud voice and she responded in a tone
that made Democracy shake all over the
country.
The nomination of Bewail may have had
some effect on the vote in Maine, but it
was not the kind of effect the Popocrats
counted on.
The free-traders conferred one benefit
on the woolmen. They opened the eyes
of sheep-raisers and made good Republi
cans of them.
There may be some Democracy and some
Populism in the secret councils of the fu
sion, but on the stump nothing shows up
but Bryanism.
The Democrats and Populists seem to
have left Bryan to make the National
campaign by himself while they scramble
for tbe local spoils.
Old man Palmer and old man Buckner
have the satisfaction of knowing that tbe
Maine lick didn't hit them as hard as it
hit the other fellow.
In the National Fopocrat fusion tbe
Democrats got the candidate, but tbe
Populists drew up tbe platform and in
tend to hold the boy orator to it.
To promote the free coinage of silver by
international agreement is the pledge of
the Republican party, and on that pledge
it is entitled to the support of every free
silver man who stands for protection and
is opposed to Bryanism.
Make yourself ready to attend the Re
publican primaries on Saturday, Septem
ber 19. Every Republican should cast his
vote in bis Assembly district on that day,
and put himself in line for harmony,
unity and regularity in the party.
In the letter notifying Tom Watson of
his nomination Marion Butler, in com
menting on the fusion programme, says:
"The People's party is the real force, tbe
mainspring behind this great political
revolution." How do stalwart Democrats
like that?
Standing for silver is one thing, but
standing for Bryanism is quite a different
matter, and while we consistently support
the cause of bimetallism we can never be
other than the earnest and active opponent
of silver monometallism, free trade and
The victory in Maine for protection and
bimetallism has been the most complete
and overwhelming ever won in the history
of the State, and there ought now to be no
doubt in any mind as to what is the pre
vailing sentiment among the people on
the issues before them.
In their rage over tne certain defeat that
awaits them the Bryanites are once more
trying to induce people to believe the Re
publican party advocates the single gold
standard, but the people laugh at these
efforts of rage and recall the words of the
Republican platform: "We are opposed
to the free coiuage of silver except by in
ternational agreement with the leading
commercial nations of the world, which
we pledge ourselves to promote,"
THE MAINE ELECTION.
The dispatches of yesterday giving the
exact returns of the Maine election far
exceeded the hopes and expectations of
the day before. The confident prediction
that Maine would roll up a decisive ma
jority for the Republican State ticket has
been more than justified and the result
has indicated to the whole country the
action of New England in tbe National
elections of November next.
It is a vain and idle undertaking for the
Democrats to lessen or explain away the
seriousness of the blow which the party of
Bryan and Sewall has received in Maine.
The hope that Mr. Sewall's popularity in
his native State would avail to change the
convictions of the people of Maine has
been rudely scattered. The claim that
there was a ground swell of sentiment in
favor of free silver throughout the Eastern
States, which would manifest itself at the
Maine election has been shown to be
utterly false.
The political insanity which dominated
the Chicago convention and compelled the
nomination of Bryan and Sewall has been
made plain to the people of the whole
country by the increased majority in Mr.
SewaH'B own State. That the whole of
New England and all of the Middle States
will go Republican in November is already
an assured fact, and that the great central
and northern States of the West will follow
the example which Maine and Vermont
have nobly set there is little room to doubt.
While Democracy and Populism are
engaged in various parts of the country
in a struggle to see which will succeed in
swallowing the other, the Republican
party is rolling up victory upon victory in
those populous States whose electoral
votes will count for most next November.
Republicans ail over the country may
well regard with hope and pride the
sweeping victory in M me, ana see in
it the swell of a mighty billow, which,
rising upon the far-off coasts of New Eng
land, will sweep over the whole country
and entrulf the shattered ships of the
Bryan Democracy in its resistless course.
This is not a question of protecting ovr own
silver product. It is a question of putting
the faith of this Government under the stiver
product of the world, not for the benefit of
our people, but for the benefit of the mine
owners of all countries. â Senator Thurston.
McKINLEY AND WOOL-GROWERS.
One of the most interesting speeches
Major McKiniey has maae to visiting
delegations was delivered before l(X>0
farmers from the sheep-growinc district
of Ohio last Monday. It abounded in
statistical information which not only in
terests those engaged in the wool industry
but those in other business enterprises,
for there is an intimate relation existing
between all occupations in this country.
Major McKiniey has been a conspicuous
champion of the industries and wage
earners of the United States from his
youth up, we might say, and when occa
sion requires him to enter largely into the
question of protection to the interests of
his countrymen he becomes decidedly in
teresting, so familiar with the subject is
he.
Referring to the importance of the sheep
industry to the whole country, Major Mc-
Kiniey said that "in 1892 there were 700,
-000 wool-growers in the United States â
700,000 people whose chief occupation was
that of wool-growing. There were prob
ably oue-fourth as many more who were
owners of small nocks of sheep in the
United States. This industry employed
besides those who owned the flocks, it is
estimated, at least 500,000 laborers, repre
senting, with those who were dependent
upon them, nearly 2,500,000 pe0p1e. In Ore
gon, Utah, Washington, Idaho and West
ern Montana there were 6,710,746 sheep,
which were worth in 1892 $13,421,000. and
which in 1896 were worth, only $6,710,000.
In 1892 we had 47,273,553 sheep in the
United States, valued at $125,000,000. In
1895 we had 38,298,000, valued at $65,000,
-000."
Such a shrinkage of values in any in
dustry would be hard to bear were it to
come from natural causes, but when it
comes of laws deliberately enacted to ac
complish that very thing it would seem
that there was plenty of reason why the
people should be aroused â why they should
earnestly resulve to right the great wrong.
It is not surprising, therefore, that 1000
representative wool-growers of the coun
try should journey all the way to Canton
to bear Major McKiniey tell them how,
if he is elected, he will lift this great in
dustry out of the mire of bankruptcy and
place it upon the solid ground of pros
perity.
But Major McKiniey is not pledged to
right the wrongs that free trade has in
flicted upon sheep-raisers and neelect
other interests that have been crippled by
the Wilson act. His policy contemplates
the restoration of all lines of business and
trade to where they were before they were
driven tothwwall by Democratic blunder
ing. The sheep industry is one among a
thousand business enterprises that need to
have protection against an unnatural and
ruinous competition, and Major McKin
iey is pledged to see that all interests have
their rights. But of all the various en
terprises and interests that will call his at
tention the cause of labor will be first and
foremost. Major McKiniey will not be
satisfied until every wage-earner has ail
the opportunity he wants to employ his
skill and muscle at wages that shall amply
remunerate him.
"The tudden withdrawal of $620,000,000 of
gold from the currency of the country would
undoubtedly produce a financial and indus
trial disturbance far more disastrous to the in
terest of labor than has ever been experi
enced in our history; and no man who has a
particle of syvipathy for workingmen and
their dependent families can contemplate the
possibility of 'â¢ such a calamity without feel
ing that it is hit duty, whether he occupies a
private or public position, to emvloy every
honorable means at his command to avert
it."â Secretary Carlisle.
FOR HONEST MONEY.
A Dew club has been organized in this
City to work in the cause of sound money.
The membership includes men in all
lines of business and of both political
parties. It is a non-partisan organization
as to politics, but it is very partisan as to
sound and honest money. The purpose of
tne club is to furnish information to
workingmen, in the several trades more
especially, concerning the money ques
tion and the necessity for maintaining a
system of circulating medium which shall
make all forms of our money as good as
gold every hour in the day.
The club, being composed of men from
all the channels of business and employ
ment, will come in touch with the rank
and file of the labor world, and no doubt
good results will follow. Men in all sta
tions of life are more interested in thÂ«
money question than ever before, and it
is right that facts and figures should be
distributed liberally, so that every one
may be informed on the subject. As a
matter of fact, no one wants unsound
money; but some are advocating theories
which, if pat in practical operation, would
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1896.
certainly disturb the monetary system of
the country very seriously.
There probably never was a time when
the people as a whole had so much occa
sion to study the problem of cause and
effect in the channels of trade and in the
systems of money coinage as now, and if
this new club shall be the means of giving
the people information that can be relied
upon great good wiil be accomplished.
Nevertheless the fact remains that the
greater question is the one of opening the
doors of our industries so that labor may
have employment at just wages. Labor
is more interested in that which will give
it opportunity to earn money than in
propositions to change our monetary
system. ___^__^______
I will not notice the impassioned appeals
made by Mr. Bryan to inflam-e the poor
against the rich. IVhenever a Presidential
candidate can stoop to the arts of the dema
gogue, the cause which he advocates must be
poor indeed. He gives no reason and pro
duces no proof for the bold position he takes,
but makes up in assertion what he lacks in
reason or proof. â Senator Caffery.
A WORD TO FARMERS.
Business depression in this country is
always caused by labor being unable to
find remunerative employment, and since
our shops, mills and factories give em
ployment directly and iudirocily to prac
tically all labor, it follows, of course, that
when our industries are crippled all must
suffer. To illustrate how the conditions
under which our industries exist influ
ence general business we need only to
refer to the consumption of wheat by our
own people in given years â breadstuffs in
dicating in some measure the consumption
of other articles of food.
In IS9O the industries of the country
were in operation on full time for the
most part, and wages were remunerative.
In that year the per capita consumption
of wheat (reduced to flour) was 6.09
bushels. In 1894, when the Wilson bill
had forced our industries into employing
labor on short time, or to close altogether,
the per capita consumption of wheat was
3.41 bushels. In 1895 there was a spas
modic revival in some of the industries,
when the consumption per capita increased
to 4.54 bushels, but the average consump
tion for 1894-95 was a trifle less than four
bushels per man, woman and child, against
6.09 in 1890. This shows a decrease of 33
per cent in the demand upon farmers for
their products.
But for the items of meats, clothing and
other articles which could be more or less
dispensed with, the shrinkage in the home
consumption demand was very much
greater than it was for breadstuffs. Some
idea of the effect of depression in our busi
ness life may be gathered from the follow
ing statements by eminent economic
statisticians: "There are now 24,000,000
men, women and children occupied for
pain in all the arts on which life depends.
If constructive enterprise is paralyzed as
it has been and only 6 per cent are idle,
that means 1,200,000 men out of work and
nearly 4,000,000 people suffering want,
while the food they would consume chokes
the farms with unsalable products. If 10
per cent are idle, 2,400,000 need work and
7,200,000 people suffer want, while the
food rots and wastes in the farmers' bins."
This ought to satisfy any farmer that in
ratio to the demand for labor is there a
demand for his products independent of
the Liverpool markets, where he comes in
competition with Russian, Indian and
South American farmers, who employ the
cheapest labor in the world. But our
home demand for labor is continuous or
spasmodic in ratio to the ability of our
industries to compete with foreign pauper
labor, and hence it follows that protection
to our industries and labor is necessary
to our farmers if they would have a home
market for their products.

BRYAN'S "ENEMIES."
Referring to advocates of honest money
in general ana the Republican party in
particular Mr. Bryan informed one of his
wayside audiences the other day that "the
enemy with whom we are fighting in this
campaign is an enemy who has never gone
into an open battle. The advocates of a
gold standard have never dared to submit
tbe gold standard to the arbitrament of a
ballot." Strictly speaking that is true, for
there never has been a gold-standard
party in this country, although the Na
tional Democratic party is practically so,
but Mr. Brvan was, as we have said, re-
I ferrine to the Republican party and those
of other parties who are standing np for
honest money.
If the Republican victory in Vermont
did not satisfy Mr. Bryan that the
"enemy" is pretty well equipped and
ready for battle, tbe returns from Maine
should at least convince him that the army
of honest money and prosperity can put
up a pretty good outpost tight.
The people of the United States are not
afraid to fight for their convictions, and
they dare submit whatever they advocate
to the arbitrament of the ballot. More
over, only Mr. Bryan looks upon a politi
cal opponent as an "enemy," and if he
really doubts tbe friendship of the Ameri
can people for Americans, let him go to
Maine. He would be as warmly received
there as in Arkansas, but he would find
the people ready to vote against him,
though they would do it in the most
friendly way. This is a nation of friends,
as Mi. Bryan should know.
The Republican party stands to-day, as it
has always stood, opposed to the continuation
of an industrial policy which cripples in
dustries at home, robs labor of its just reward
and supplies insufficient revenues to run the
Government. â McKiniey.
BRYAN-SEW ALL-WATSON.
The returns from Maine, which show
the greatest victory the Republican party
has ever won in that State, are likely to
add more tangles to the Bryan-Sewall-
Watson combine. Sewall has not only
proven that he has no influence at his
home, but that his candidacy is a po&itive
injury to the party he represents, and
what is still wo! S3 is that tbe Watson end
of the three-cornered combination is re
joicing with exceeding great joy that the
plutocratic end has come to grief. Wat
son can be relied upon to hold Bewail re
sponsible for the annihilation of the com
bine in Maine, although it was the com
mon-sense of the people that did the
work, and be will splice it on to his already
at rone lever to pry the Maine millionaire
off the track.
But Watson proposes to do more than
that. He is en route to Chicago
to confer with' leading Populists, and
it is said thit he will have good
backinp when he makes a demand
to drop iiryan and put a true and
tried Populist in his place on the ticket.
Wats an will agree, "however, to keep
Bryan at the head of the ticket if he will
come out and indorse tbe Populist plat
form from top to bottom and do whatever
else may te necessary to give him full
membership in that party. It is very evi
dent that Watson is in the North to make
trouble for Bryan and Sewall, and there is
foundation for the rumor that Benator
Butler, chairman of the Populist National
Committee, is not trying to persuade
Watson to desist.
It certainly is unfortunate for Bryan
and Sewall that the people of Maine rolled
up such a mighty majority against them.
Especially is Bryan put in an awkward
position. There are thousands of Demo
crats who would be glad to vote for
Bryan and Sewall, because they are the
regular nominees of the party, but they
would not vote for Bryan and Watson.
They are perfectly willing to make a con
venience of tbe Populists and give them a
few local offices, but it is quite a different
thing to "miÃcegenate," as a Southern
Democrat puts it.
In any event, the Maine election is
bound to intensify the Populist feeling
against Sewall's candidacy, and it would
be no surprise if Watson should succeed
in having Bryan officially notified that
the continuance of himself as the Popu
list candidate for President is contingent
upon his demanding the withdrawal of
Sewall. The old story about how the
gods first make mad those whom they
wish to destroy fits the Bryan-Sewall-
Watson combination perfectly, and the
Republicans of Maine are largely respon
sible for it,__
The people of this count y never were so
eager to vote as now. Tive last four years
have been long years â the longest four years
since our great civil var. Everything has
suffered but the Republican party. Every
thing has been blighted but Republican prin
ciples, and they are dearer, more cherished
and more glorious than they have ever been
before. â McKiniey.
THE WEEKLY CALL.
While The vVeekly Call was primarily
issued as a medium of news its mission
has been so broadened that it is now of
special interest to farmers and miners,
while it always contains articles including
so many interests that no member of the
household can do without it.
Politically it is devoted to the upbuild
ing of the party which has always labored
in the interests of the United States and
its prosperityâ the party of Lincoln, Gar
field and Gran t. Full reports of the claims
of all other parties, however, are given,
and without prejudice.
There is always choice light literature
for the young folks of the household.
Realizing the difficulty experienced by
farmers at a distance from market in
i acquainting themselves with prices of
! farm products we furnish a concise review
of the market quotation of all produce for
the week, which may be relied upon as
being accurate.
You can place The Weekly Call in the
hands of yonr Eastern friends with confi
dence that it will help to bring them to
California. It is clean, bright and in
structive and should find a place in every
household where a daily cannot be ob
tained. Get tbe issue which appears to

BORROWING FOREIGN IDEAS.

BEET SUGAR.
Effect of Frke Trade py a, Yottsq AsrerticAK
Industry.
Chicago Inter pcean.
There are certain facts relative to beet sugar
that cannot be overcome. The first is that
while the imports of cane sugar to Great Brit
ain have undergone a decrease in the eleven
yean between and including 1884-85 and
1894-95 the imports of beet sugar have in
creased. In 1884-85 the total imports of cane
sugar to the United Kingdom were 598,000
tous, in 1894-95 they were 370,000 tons. In
1884-85 the imports of refined foreign sugar
(mostly btet) and raw beet sugar were 707,700
tons, and in 1894-95 they were 1,275.000 ton*.
The statistics of the United State* are not so
precise in iheir classification of imported sugar
as are those of Great Britain, but from the sta
tistical abstract for 1895 we learn that during
three years, 1892, 1893 and 1894, in which,
by provision of tiio McKiniey tariff, bounty
wat paid on all American sugar, as in Ger
many it is paid on ail home-made beet sugarâ
the German climate being too rigorous for the
cultivation of sugar c*neâ the increase ol
sugar products stood thus: Amount of cane
sucar on which bounty was paid in 1892,
3bi, 752,306 pounds; amount on which bounty
was paid in 1894, 611.156,922 pounds; thus
nearly doubling production in three year*
and far more than doubling It from 1890-91,"
when the total output was but 287,490.2/1.
But the effect upon the beet-sugar industry
was still more remarkable, for in 1892 boun
ties were paid on 12,004,838 pounds, ami in
1895 on 45, 191.290. It seems scandalous that
a measure that uearly quadrupled tho output
of so promising an iniant industry was re
pealed The effect of repeal was instanta
neous â¢ the output of beet sugar fell to 405,
-<>36 pounds In 1895, taking tbe bounty tables
Si the statistical abntract as authority
But though a criminally stupid policy has
diminished tne production of American beet
suitar the use of the foreign article increases.
In 1888 no more than 1640 tons of beet sugar
were imported; three years later the imports
were 2800 tons; four years later they were
5400 tons; in the next year they more than
doubled themselves, and showed us 12.000
tons- in 1894 they were 20,443 tons, aud in
1895 they were 30.000 tons. These figures arc
eloquent. Germany gives bounties, and after
supplying her home demands is able to export
446,000 tons of raw beet sugar, and the greater
part of 729,000 tons of refined, to Great
Britain, and 30,000 tons to the United Slates.
We. after nearly quadrupling our output by
three years of bounties, elect Democrais, who
repeal the stimulative measure and reduce the
output to a contemptible figure.

Rct.es That Governâ a. L. F., City. The
rules that govern the admission into the Hast

Graduates of the University of California
will be admitted without examination.
Graduates of other institutions of learning
may also, in the discretion of the board of di
rectors, be admitted without examination.
Jumpingâ F. R. , City. If a man stood in the
aisle of a car moving at a rapid rate of speed
and facing in the direction opposite to that in
which the car was moving and made a stand
ing jump he would land at about the'same
point that he would if the car was standing
still, or if he landed any farther the distance
would be almost impercep:ible. The reason
of this is the atmospheric resistance he would
have to meet. If the air was withdrawn from
the car so as to create a vacuum and the indi
vidual could remain in the vacuum long
enough to jump the lack of resistance and the
motion of the car would land him a little
farther than if the car under like conditions
whs at a standstill.
Temporary Absence,â J. F., City. This cor
respondent writes:
A is a citizen of the United States who at the
time or hla late registration at the City Hall had
been (for more than four months) a bona-nde
resident of the Thirtieth Assembly and Fourth
Congressional districts. Subsequent to his regis
tration (and some days after the close of
precinct registration) he waa employed to look
after the welfare of an invalid, whose home was
and still is In the Forty-third Assemnlv, Fourth
CougresslODal District, and A will continue in
such employment down to ana including the last
day of September, 1896, when his employment, as
stated. cfMta, upon which date be returns to his
former domicile In the Thirtieth Assembly Dis
trict, and intends to reside therein permanently
up to and including election day next November
I might here remark, by way of parenthesis
that owing to the nature of nls employment A
was compelled 10 remain, temporarily, while thus
employed, at the residence of [he invalid. Is. or is
not, A disfranchised ty reason of his temporary
residence in the Forty-thlrfl District?
The answer to the question is that a person
must not be considered to have lost his resi
dence who leaves his home to go Into another
State, or precinct in this State, for temporary
purposes only, with the Intention of return
ing. If A during his temporary absence con
tinued to maintain his home in the Thirtieth
District, and did not do any act that could hp
construed into a desire to remove from there
ihen he did not loie his residence there and
would be entitled to vote in that district.

The fate of the whaling brig Hidalgo
seems to be somewhat in doubt. A few
weeks ago news arrived from the north to
the effect that the whaler was reported
with two whales, and yesterday a private
letter to Bruce, Bowne & Co. stated that
the brig was hard and fast on the beach
near Point Hope. The news came to
Seattle on the schooner Jessie, and the
only dispatch received in this City was as
follows: "The brig Hidalgo, is a wreck
on the beach about a mile from my house.
I received your letter and box." This was
dated from Point Hope on July 30, and
was signed by a well-known Alaskan
trader.
The Hidalgo went ashore In almost the
same place a few years ago, and the ac
companyiug cut is taken from a sketch
made at that time. She is, or wa3, one of
the old-timers, having been forty-one
years in active service. She was at one
time a lumber-carrier, but recently her
main business has .been whaling. The
season before last she did not fit out, and
was laid up in Oakland Creek. Lust year
Captain Lew Williams took her out and
with Bruce, Bowne & Co. got her ready
for sea. During her career she was re
markably lucky, and time and again came
back with the best catch of the season.
On this occasion she seems to have been
in hard look. She was built in Maine In
1855, and at one time was a clipper on the
Atlantic. When she left here on the
present cruise Captain C. F. Gifford was
in command; John Wells, first mate;
John San .Francisco, second mate; Chris-

tian Bten, third mate; Frank Graham and
Pedro LoDes, boatsteerers; Joe Katch,
steward, and H. Kawai, cook. These men
and the entire crew of thirty-one, all told,
were saved; but the chance? are that the
old-timer will be a total loss, and there is
not a cent of insurance on her.
The State .Board of Examiners is after
the State Board of Harbor Commissioners.
The new Jerry depot is under discussion
and the Harbor Commissioners have to
make explanations. Numerous changes
have been made in the plans of the late
A. Page Brown, not one of which has
been approved by Chief Eneineer Holmes.
The board has rejected the suggestions
whenever they were made and the Risdon
Iron Works has been ordered to complete
its contract according to specifications.
Still changes aggregating an increase of
$15,000 have been recommended by Archi
tect fciwain, and the Board of Examiners
want to know the why and the wherefore.
A meeting has been called for the 21st
inst. and President Colnon has Jieen sum
moned to De in attendance and bring all
papers bearing on the new ferry depot
with him. He will obey the order and
place all the information in the hands of
the board. The original plans and speci
fications mode by the late A. Page Brown
have been ordered placed in the Safe De
posit vaults and the work of building the
depot will be done from copies. Just
what the trouble is remains to be seen,
but one thing is Bure â no extra money
wiJl be expended while Chief Engineer
Holmes is in charge of affairs.
President Colnon put himself on record
yesterday. "We have a man drawing
considerable money out of that building
(the new ferry depot), and I think he
should be a&ked to give us some particu
lars," said he. "Why can't he supply us
with the weights of the beams and the

The question of lights in the ferry post

Holmes' recommendation it was decided
to curtail the number of burner*. Too
many lights w,ete provided for each man

LILLIAN SWANN HAPPY
After Thirteen Years' Separation From
Her Parents She Will Soon
Kejoin Them.
Lillian Swarm, the colored girl who was
stolen from her parents in Washington,
D. C, thirteen years ago and located in
this City last week, will soon leave to join
them again.
Chief Crowley a few days ago received a
letter from Major Moore, Superintendent
ot Police in Washington, that the girl's
parents were respectable, but too poor to
pay her fare back. The Chief became in
terested in the girl after seeing her and
determined to help her rejoin her pa
rents.
Yesterday he procured free transporta
tion for her as far as Chicago, and he will
delray the additional fare out of his own
pocket to take her from there to Washing
ton. The girl will leave for Washington
about September 28, and yesterday the
Chief wired Major Moore to that effect.
TWO OLYMPIANS AT WAR
Philip Wand Wants Samuel F.
Hughes, the Druggist,
Arrested.
He Charges Him With Threats to
Kill and Exhibiting a Deadly
Weapon.
A valuable setter dog has caused serious
trouble between two well-known members
of the Olympic Club, Samuel F. Hughes,
druggist on Powell and Post streets, and
Philip Wand. 410 Post street.
Wand yesterday swore to complaints be
fore Judge Campbell charging Hughes
with threats to kill and exhibiting a deadly
weapon in a rude and threatening man
ner.
The complaints were written out by
Warrant Clerk Graham of Judge Joachim
sen's court and to him Wand told his
story.
"I own a valuable setter," said Wand,
"and Hughes owns another. About two
weeks ago he asked me to bring my dog
from the country as he wanted to see it.
I told him 1 bad no accon. modation lor
the dog, and he said that would be all
ri^ht ; he would keep it in his store.
"I sent for the dog and took it to
Hughes' store. He got jealous of ray dog,
thinking, I suppose, it could beat his in
the coming f-eld trials at Stockton, and re
fused to keep it any longer.
"Late iaat night, just as Hughes had
closed his store, Charley Morroll and I
were passing. Morrell had his bull pup
with him and Huehes wanted to bet $50
that his cocker spaniel would whip the
ball pun. I told him he wouldn't bet 5
cents that he was alive. He got mad and
said he supposed I was angry b"cause he
had put out my doe, and we had some
words.
"I stepped toward him and he pulled a
gun oat of his pocket. He backed away,
keeping nis gun pointed at me, and
threatened to bore me full of holes if I
came nearer him. I was unarmed, and as
I believed he would carry out his threat
Morrell and I left him."
Hughes was arrested last evening and
booked at the City Prison. He was imme
diately released on his own recognizance
by Judge Campbell.
H. F. STOLZ EXONERATED
The Accusation Against Him of Selling

After Thorough Invest Ration.
H. F. Stolz, the popular young batcher
of 512 Castro street, has been absolutely
exonerated of all connection with the

ANOTHER CHANCE
FOR W. A. SANDERS
The Supreme Court Grants
His Plea for a New
Trial.
OLD MYSTERY REVIVED.
No Explanation of the Strange
Disappearance of William
Wootton. .
THE VE EDICT IS SET ASIDE.
The Convicted Man Will Have an Op.
portunity to Clear His Name
From Shame.
W. A. Sanders, whose connection with
the Wootton case led to his conviction for
forgery about a year ago, has been granted
another chance to prove his innocence.
Yesterday the Supreme Court, allowed
him a new trial, thus bringing once more
to public notice one of the most mysteri
ons murder cases in the history of the
State.
Sandors is now a man of 60 years, and
has long been prominent in educational
circles, having been very successful as a
public schoolteacher, in Fresno, where
be lived with his family, resided William
Wootton, a wealthy ranch-owner, with
whom Sanders was very friendly. In 1894
Sanders suggested to Wootton that he
should sell his large farm. Wootton acqui
esced, ana it was arranged that the prop
erty should be sold to two friends of Sand
ers' named, respectively. Graves and
Knansch, for $50,000. An installment of
$20,000 was paid to Sanders on the Ist of
February, 1894.
On the same day Wootton disappeared,
and nothing has been heard of him since.
Some time after Wootton'a disappear-'
ance Sanders pres ented and cashed a check !
for $1400, purport ing to have been drawn
by Wootton against the firm of Kutna,
Goldstein & Co. Meanwhile the mysteri
ous absence of Wootton had occasioned
much talk, and eventually Sanders was
accus ed of making away with him. The
case was tr ied, but it was found impossi
ble to fix the guilt of murder upon San
ders. He was, however, convicted of forg
in c Wootton's name to the check.
The men Graves and Knausch were
sought high and low, but could not be
found; and it was surmised that the names
were fi ctitious. Sanders, in disgrace and
under the shadow of a damning and terri
ble, though unproved, accusation of mur
der, was sent into confinement as a con
vie led forger.
In granting the motion for a new trial
the Supreme Court says:
It was incumbent upon the prosecution to
show that the instrument purporting to have
been executed by William AVooitou wns in fact
a forgery. One mode by which they undertook
to establish this was by evidence that Wootton
was dead before the day upon which the in
strument bore dale. True, this would not con
clusively establish the Jalse character of tho
draft, for a man might postdate such an inÂ«tru
ment. Nevertheless, it would be evidence
tending to Fhow its false character. Again.it
was a proper part of the case of the prosecution
to show that the defendant uttered and passed
the instrument, knowing it to be forgea, and,
if the prosecution could establish to the satis
faction of the jury :hat Wootton had died be
fore the day upon which the instrument bore
date, and that Sanders knew of his death, it
would unquestionably be strong evidence tend
ing to show that he knowingly passed a forged
instrument.
But the prosecution having the undoubted
right to prove these things was not to be de
prived of that right merely because the prov
ing of the death of Wootton involved the evi
dence ot the crime of murder against th.^
defendant. The prosecution, iv proving the
death of Wootton, was entitled to show the
manner of nis death, and n, in so showitip.it
was made to appear that he ba>i been foully
dealt with, and had come to his end at the
hands of the defendant, it was not for that
reuson to be excluded from the consideration
of the jury. The evidence was thus not intro
duced to besmirch the defendant or ca>t un
warranted suspicion upon him. It was neces
sarily introduced in proof of a material fact,
which it was competent for the prosecution to
show. For this reason the evidence tending to
show that Wootton was dead was admissible,
even though it tended to Bhow that he was
murdered by Sanders.
Under the circumstances and under the na
ture of the evidence which had been brought
to bear aeainst Sanders he should have been
allowed the fullest latitude in the matter.
The court, however, under objections from
the prosecution, iefuscd to admit the evidence
of Traver, aud left such fragments of it as were
admitted in an eviscerated and well nigh un
intelligible condition. This was a hardship
and injury to the defendant. The importance
to the defendant Sanders of evidence, even the
slightest, showing or tending to show that
after that time Wootton was seen in the com
pany presumably oi the two men whom tho
prosecution claims to be myths is manifest,

and no discussion is needed to show' the in

Many of the instructions proposed by the de
fendant were not fully embraced In the
instructions piven. Defendant's proposed in
structions as to the reception Dy the jury of
evidence ofextrn judicial admissions or conces
sions were not objectionable in law, and should
have been (riven. The jury was not to be de
barred from considering this evidence with
all The evidence in the case, because the death
oi Wootton might not have been proved to
their satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt,
for the death of Wootton might not have been
under the evidence, and, in the view of the
jury, necessary to be conclusively esublixhed
to warrant a verdict. If, however, the jury
believed from the evidence that the defendant
was not guilty unless it was proved that Woot
toon wes dead and that Sanders knew of his
death; then, under such a stat3 of the evi
dence, it would unquestionably be incumbent
upon the pro-eeution to estab-ish the fact of
his death and of the defendant's knowledge
of that fact beyond and to the exclusion of any
reasonable doubt.

AMNESTY FOR
IRISH PRISONERS,
Local Societies Will Help
Their Country-'
men.
ALL FOBCES ARE UNITED
A Great Outburst of Sympathy
â¢ for Those Already
Set Free.
MANY PLANS TO EAISE MONEY
Those Just Turned Out of British
Jails Will G t Much Aid From
San Francisco.
Apropos of the arrest of Tynan and
other Irish suspects at Boulogne and else
where, it may be noted that there is great
! activity amone patriotic Irishmen in San
1 Francipco, who are preparing to do all in
1 their power to raise funds for the comfort
and relief of the five Irish prisoners who
have lately been released from English
jails. Their ycheme aiso embraces the
raising of funds for the relief of such pris
oners as may be released hereafter.
*'To accomplish this purpose," said Pres
ident Jeremiah Deasy of the Celtic Union
last night, "there will be a meeting of rep
resentatives from all the prominent Irish
societies in the buy cities at an early date.
We shall do all we can lor Whiiehead,
Curtin^Dr. Gallagher, William Lynch and
Bernard Gallagher."
The following circular letter has been
sent to prominent Irishmen and to mem
bers of every Irish society in the northern
pan of the State:
We know tnat the fact has not escaped your
attention that there has been lately released
from prison by the English Government cer
tain Irish patriots, who lor thirteen years have
undergoae untold privation and suffering Â«s
prisoners In an English prison. They suffered
for deeds done in the cause of Ireland, ana are
therefore Irish patriots, Irish soldiers. They
come to us now, broken in body and mind,
heart and souL
To express for these patriotic men our
heartfelt sympathy, to adopt ways and means
to give them immediately some financial as
sistance, to utter our protest against and con
demnation of the brutal and uncivilized pol
icy of the English Government toward Irish
political prisoners find to demand the release
of those still confined in English dungeons,
are the objects of the meeting. They appeal to
every lover of freedom and humanity in gen
eral and to every Irishman in particular.
It is the duty of every Irishman to mani
fest an active and enthusiastic interest in this
matter.
We sincerely trujt that you will be present
_â "'_â  M <"â¢ O'Toole, President.

Committee.
The general work lor the relief of the
prisoners just released has spread to every
Irish society in the State, as well as to
ocieties throughout the Unior. To assist
the released prisoners the Irish National
ists have decided to give an annual re
union and picnic at Shell Mound Park on
Sunday, October 4. Tins will be under
the control of the Knights of Tara, assisted
by members of the Knights of the Ked
Branch, the Wolfe Tone Club of Oakland
and the Irish National Alliance. The
Knights of Tara have issued a circular in
viting everybody to attend the picnic, the
proceeds of which go to the released pris
oners. The circular says in part:
This invitation is particularly extended to
you and friends and all persons who love
justice and liberty, lhat kind of liberty de
scribed in the constitution of the United
States. One-half the receipts will be contrib
uted to a relief fund for the lately released
Irish political prisoners who suffered thirteen
yearn of cruel and inhuman torture in English
dungeons, because they wore possessed with a
sp;rit of freedom and used thai spirit for the
love they bore their native land, Ireland.
"The committee has arranged fora great
entertainment," said J. T. Tynan last
night. "There will be prizes for dancing,
rnnning races, jumping and other sports
for men, women and children. There will
be music by the Hibernian band, and Pro
fessor McCarthy has volunteered to at
tend and play Irish jigs, reels and horn
pipe music, and Professor McMahon will
also play Irish music on the violin."
The local committees in charge of the
relief movement have just received a spir
ited appeal from thu Irish National Alli
ance, addressed "to the people ot Amer
ica." It is signed by men prominent
throughout the Union, the following be
ing the executive committee: John J.
Donovan, Lowell. Mass.; Martin Kelly,
Memphis, Term.; J. Sheehy, San Fran
cisco; James Lawlor, Galveston ; Chris
Gallagher, Minneapolis; Michael Mengon,
Fom:-du-Lac; J. M. Kennedy, Anaconda,
Mont., and Thomas H. Greevy, Altoona,
Pa.
The circular just issued by these men
reads in part aslollows:
"Thesp are men who for thirteen years
have suffered untold tortures for the
crime o! loving Ireland. They have been
thrown upon the world by the British
Government now, utterly broken in
health and at the point of death. They
will soon be with uÂ» in the land of liberty.
"These men are the wounded soldiers of
Ireland, and it is the duty of the Irish
race to come to their rescue. They must
have rest and be carefully tended if they
are ever to resume their places in this
wo/ld.
"To secure this rest and care a large
sum of money will be necessary, and for
this reason we appeal to you for the sane
of common humanity and for the love
you bear the patriots who went into the
light for our motherland. There is no one
so poor as not to be able to aid in tnis
noble work."
But the work under way extends be
yond giving relief to those that have been
released. It comprehends a movement to
get amnesty for those now in British jails.
There are just twelve Irish political
prisoners now remaining in English jails,
ana all were convicted of "treason-fel
ony," as the English law terms the crime,
and all but one are serving life-sentences.
The following seven are in Portland
Prison: Henry Hayward Wilson, Harry
Burton, Henry I>aiton, Patrick Flanagan,
Terrence McDermott and John Duff. In
Downpatnck Jail in Ireland there are
Joseph Mullet, James Fitzharris, Law
rence Hanlon, Matthew Mullen and Mat
thew Kinsella.
"It has been believed all along that a
number of these men would i-oon be re
leased, and the efforts of the American
organizations will be toward doing every
thing possible for these. The Amnesty
Associatiou will do all in its power for the
release of every prisoner, and the local
societies of this City and State are in full
sympathy with the work under way
tnroughont the Nation. The prisoners
were all young men when arrested, but
the hardships of English jails have broken
nearly aJI down in health.
Besides benefits, picnics and like per
formances, it is said there will be syste
matic canvassing for funds. When there
is a general meeting of committees from
the principal Hibernian societies the plan
for raising money will be determined upon
and the field will be thoroughly covered.
Sharks are frequently killed that weigh
three or four thousand pound?.

THE OLD COLLEGE
WILL BE ABLAZE
A Grand Fete Champetre
on the Old Mission
Road.
FOR A NOBLE PURPOSE.
An Ancient Educational Building
Covered With Creeping
Ivy.
BEAUTIES IN A BOWER.
The Flock of Old St. Mary's Parish
Are Prepared to Give the Word
a Rare Treat.
The old St. Mary's College, so dear to
the hearts of thousands of lads who were
eiven the f" rst rudiments of knowledge
within the picturesque precincts, has been
turned into one immense bower. The
massive stone building, built more than
forty years ago much as were similar col
leges and monasteries of two centuries
ago, is now covered with ivy and almost
hidden. For some years there have been
no pupils there, but the place has always
been cared lor under the watchful eyes of
Rev. .Peter D. Brady, who is in charge of
what is known as tne "Old St. Mary's
Parish." There are seventy acres in the
old college grounds, and it has generally
been understood that these belonged to
the parish. Instead, this vast domain be
longs to the Archbishop, and only the cen
ter floor of the main college building has
been allowed the parishioners as a place
of worship.
With a view to getting funds for the
purpose of buying land and building a
home of their own the people of that sec
tion have gathered about their pastor and
to-night they will inaugurate a bazaar
such as this City has never seen.
It will be something in the nature of a
fete cham pe re, lasting until the night of
September 26. The outdoor part of the
programme will be the delightful prome
nades 'mid lovely groves, decorated with
bun tin -j and illuminated with thousands
of Japanese lanterns. The scene, as re
hearsed last night, would carry a person
back to feudal times before the castle of
fome particularly generous Baron who
was entertaining his people.
Owing to the Illness of Hon. Samuel
Shortridge the opening address to-night
will be delivered by the Hon. M. C.
H asset t.
The remainder of the programme will
be as follows: Barytone solo by i). M.
Warde, accompanied by R. Fletcher Til
ton; fancy dance by Miss and Master
Smith ; vocal solo by Mrs. J. Coad ; recita
tion by Miss Barry.
In the main hall of the college, where
the services have been held so long, the
booths will be established. They will be
presided over by the daintiest ladies, as
follows:
Reireshmentsâ Mrs. Cherry and Mrs. and
Miss Chambers.
Table Iâ Mrs. O'Neil, Mrs. Redmond, Mrs.
McCann, Mrs. Meyers, Miss Hashagen and Miss
O'Xeil.
Booth 2â Mrs. Richardson. Mrs. Millerick,
Mrs. McDevltt, Miss Lizzie Skehan and Mies
Eckles.
Booth Bâ Mrs. Mlnnehan, Miss Michell, Mrs.
NichoU, Mrs. Williams, Miss Nicholl and Miss
Minnehan.
Booth 4â Presided over by the Immaculate
Conception Sodality: Misses Mollle Skehan,
Josie Cereghino, Lizzie Clark, Mamie Conley,
Mamie Eldridge, Nora Thompson, Kittie
Welsh, Mrs. Riley and other memoers of the
sodality.
Booth sâ Mrs. Menke, Mrs. Kelly, Miss Kelly,
Miss Menke and Mrs. Dennison.
Candy boothâ Misses Kate O'Brien, Jnlia
White, Lizzie Dennison, Jennie McCann and
Kate Keboe.
Shooting gallery â By the Young; Men's Sodal
ity: James Clarke, Joseph Mlnnehan, Timo
thy Minnehan, Harry O'Xeil and George
Tafft.
There will be a contest during the
bazaar for the most popular captain of the
League of the Gross Cadets, the prize being
an elegant sword.
On Thursday, Friday and Monday
niehts the cadets of the following com
panies will drill: St. Patrick's, St. Bren
dan's and St. Mary's.
Incidentally it may be mentioned here
that people who cannot attend the bazaar
and view the grand illumination effect
might go far in the daytime to see a
prettier spot than the dear old college
grounds.
The best way to reach this grand scene
of beauty and charity is to take the Mis
sion-street cars to the terminal and trans
fer right to the college gates.

Mexicans Celebrate the
Birthday of Their Coun
try's Liberty.
ORATORY AND MUSIC.
Bacquet of the Porfirio Diaz
Club at the Maison St.
Germain.
ORDEE OF TO-DAY'S FETE
Grand Musical Entertainment and
Ball at Union-Square Hall-Other
Features of Interest
The first vespers, so to speak, of the an
niversary of Mexican independence were
celebrated last night by the Porfirio Diaz
Club with a sumptuous banquet at the
Maison St. Germain. Among those pres
ent were: Francisco B. Romo, the presi
dent of the club; Hon. Lyman Mowry,
Chancellor Jotse V. Dosal of the Mexican
Consulate, Francisco Carranza, Professor
Martin Onlmeyer, Professor Jose Andone
gui, Carlos Mesa, Secretary Federico
Gillespie, Professor Emilio Cruells. Daniel
Gillick and Professor Will iam Van Brunt.
The table was elaborately yet tastefully
adorned with flowers and graceful ferns,
the Mexican colors, red, white and green,
predominating. The menu was abundant
and well chosen, a number of character
istic Mexican dishes forming a conspicu
ous portion of the bill of fare.
The 15th of September happens to be
the nameday of the President, the
feast of St. Porphyrius, and hence the
celebration took the character in a certain
degree of a personal tribute to the great
chief magistrate of the Mexican nation.
The Consui-General, who is at present in
Calaveras, was unable to be present, but
sent a letter of regret?.
Mr. Romo delivered tbe first after-din
ner speech. He dwelt upon the advance
which had characterized the administra
lion of President Diaz, and proposed bis
Excellency's health.
Mr. Mowry responded in an eloquent
tribute to tbe great ruier, whose history,
he said, was yet to be written in the an
nals of the world.
"The President of thf United States"
was the toast responded to by Mr. Car
ranza. Mr. Dosal spoke for the well
being of the ciub, and other speeches and
toasts followed in rapid succession.
THE SPANISH SCHOOL.
Delightful Musical and Literary
Programm? Presented by the
Pupils and Friends.
The President's name-day was honored
by the pupils ana friends of the Spanish
school last night at the school hall, 1415
Powell street, by a fine literary and mu
sical programme.
After the overture to Yon Suppe's "Boc
caccio," played by Professor and Mrs.
Botts and the pupils of the music class,
the Declaration of Mexican Independence
was read by F. Arteche, being followed by
Mies Celsa Rivero in a piano solo.
Andres Gonzules mide a masterly ad
dress in Spanish, contrasting the condi
tion of Mexico under Spanish rule with its
present flourishing status, after which the
"Magnetic Waltz," by Mrs. L. George and
H. D. Pelle, and an andante and waltz by
iir. and Mrs. Botts were i;iven.
Miss Maria Pretegave a "Poem in Honor
of Hidalgo," an original composition by
H. Sanchez, in which the work of the
heroic patriot priest was eloquently por
trayed.
Several more musical selections were
rendered in excellent style, and E. Cer
vantes made a most eloquent oration,
takinc for his text Father Hidalgo's cry
for independence from Spain. The enjoy
able affair dosed with the singing of the
inimitable National hymn of Mexico, the
verses being sung by Mrs. L. de Moran,
Mrs. M. de Sepulveda, Mrs. L. de George,
Miss B. Gallardo, Miss Concepcion Bar
ueche and F. Arteche.

according to the train taken in the oiorn
iug.
GRAND JURY'S REPORT.
An Elaborate Document Will
Be Presented to Judge
Slack.
R.view of the Workâ Many Instances
of Extravagance in the Local
Government.
The Grand Jury which was impaneled
last December wi!l meet Thursday or Fri
day of this week and present It* final re
port to tbe presiding Judge of the Superior
Court. Several of the members met
downtown yesterday afternoon and de
voted several hours to a consideration of
the report, and incidentally discussed
some business which may be transacted
at the next regular session.
Frank Maskey, foreman of the jury, re
cently returned from an outing in the
high Sierras of the Lake Taboe region.
The altitude was too much for him and
he had a narrow escape from a severe at
tack of pneumonia. He was obliged to re
treat to lower levels, aud so came home to
San Francisco almost exhausted bj' his
trip for recreation.
John Landers, one of the members of
tne Grand Jury, is in Hawaii, having been
called there to adjust agency business of
the Manhattan Lite Insurance Company.
Tbe final report, which is now "very
nearly completed, is an elaborate docu
ment, embracing 12,000 words. Much
snace is devoted to a discussion on muni
cipal extravagance, showing the reckless
waste of public money at the City Hall
and in other institutions maintained by
the taxpayers.
While the jury has indicted several
notorious felons, some of whom have
been tried, convicted and sentenced to
the penitentiary, the members are in
c:ined to regard the accusation lodged
against the Supervisors as the most im
portant work of the term. The ruling of
Judge Seawell holding that the Supervisors
must respond and explain why the assess
ment of light and transportation compa
nies was reduced is regarded with satis
faction.
It is believed that the District Attorney
will be able to convince the trial jury that
the accused Supervisors betrayed the tax
payers, especially the owners of real es
tate, and by favors granted to the corpo
rations forced one class of citizens to sus
tain an increased Durden of taxes.
The list of reduced municipal estimates
which was prepared by the Grand Jury's
expert for submission to the Board of Su
pervisors will be set forth in the final re
port. About the time that the jury had
this list ready to submit to tbe Super
visors, ihe latter exhibited such surprising
and basty action on the assessments, that
the members of the jury became con
vinced that the board was not disposed to
listen to recommendations. The estimates
prepared by the expert will specially de
biÃiiate the departments that are extrava
gantly conducted.
When this Grand Jury was organizad a
plan of action was adopted which bad in
view a reduction in the expenses of ihe
local government in order that the taxes
on merchants and homeowners should
be lessened. Early investigations Con
vinced the members of the jury that in
stitutions supported by the City, yet gov
erned by the Board of Health, were not
only badly managed, Dut were unneces
sarily expensive. An unexpected visit
was made to the Almshouse and City and
County tlospital. and the result was an
overhauling of the latter institution.
The Grand Jury gave a great deal of
attention to the subject of supplying ships
witb water. It was found that the monop
oly or sppcial privileze which the benng
Valley Water Company had granted to
Goodall, Perkins & Co. for supplying ships
with water was the cause of many griev
ous conip aints Jroni ship masters and
owners. Tneoaore F. Payne took the sub
ject in hand, and after patient investiga
tion an arrangement was effected whereby
the special privilege was revoked. Ships
are now Mipplied airectiy by the water
company at a cost slightly in excess of
meter rates, and so commerce has been
relieved of one unjust exaction.
REAL ESTATE DEAL.
Charlea Pscherhofer Arr<>ftted for Ob-
tainiiiK Money by False Pretenses.
Charles Pscherhofer, a real estate acent
at 238 Montgomery street, was arrested
yesterday afternoon 0:1 a warrant charg
ing him with obtaining money by false
pretenses.
The complaining witness is Mrs. Anna
Swissig, who alleges that Pscberhofer by
misrepresentations induced hei to pur
chase two lots in the Sutrovilie Addition,
near Stockton, last month. She claims
that when she went to examine the lots
Pscherhofer showed her lots in Liberty
Park, which is clo-e to tbe city, whereas
Sutrovilie is much farther distant.
Pscherhofer denies the allegations, and
says the Jots shown Mrs. iSwissig were in
fcuiroville, and he lias a witness to prove
it. He hints that his arrest has been in
stigated by a nvai real estate agent,

MARTIN KELLY'S
PHANTOM VOTERS
His "Primary" Ballots
Counted Before Boxes
Were Opened.
CLERKS WERE LONELY.
But They Turned in Boxes Full
of Paper in Every
Instance.
A FUNKY POLITICAL FAKE.
At the Flood Bai'd ng They Went
Tbroug'a the Forms of Receiving
the Bogus Returns-
If Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mahoney really
enjoy goin*? through the pantomime of
holding primary elections of course there
i 3 no good reason why they should not do
so. Indeed, so long as they pay the com
paratively slight cost involved not even
tbe Sheriff is disposed to interfere.
But the marvel of it is that they do en
joy such an entirely flaccid and inane
thing as the alleged primary elections of
yesterday afternoon.
Twenty-one different places were open
indifferent parts of the City in all the
wards and in some of the wards in several
places where men were posted with big
books and big ballots and in each a ballot
box. The box was early rilled up with the
ballots in some mysterious way and for
the rest of the day the men wrote ud the
books, that is, wrote the names of tbe
alleged voters in there and then checked
ud in the books such number of votes
against the names on tne ballots as they
tbougnt necessary, in only a few instances
enough care was taken in t:.e matter to
make tbe number of tbe papers in the box
representing ballots tally with ihe votes
credited on the books.
During the whole day in most of the al
leged polling-places the two men, some
times three, having charse of the absurd
pantomime, together with a policeman,
were undisturbed by a visitor, but in some
of the most drowsy of these tbe reports of
the number of ballots cast ran up toward
half a thousand.
No such absurd bit of political fakine has
ever before been witnessed in San Fran
cisco.
In the evening at headquarters no less
than 10,686 votes were reported to have
beon cast for these alleged "delegates to
the convention." The fact is that not
more than as many hundred votes were
cast as thousands were r ported, and these
were drummed up in the precincts of the
few individuals interestedâ Kelly, Ma
honey and Ruef.
In the First Ward there was a drowsy
time all day at the polling-place at Wash
ington and Kearny streets for the police
man on guard. The clerks, however,
were quite busy. The box was filled with
ballots in tbe mysterious manner stated,
and the two men were employed ali the
afternoon in checking up in tne books tbe
.tuly fur each of tUe delegates before the

Market and Jones Streets. :.,
ballot-box was opened. In no instance
din the clerks wait until the box was
opened to count the ballots. They simply
raarkod up the tally they thought it
should containâ enough to look well.
The polls ( ?) were at 518 Un ion street in
the Second Ward. There the same per
formance took place. At 3:30 in the after
noon 295 votes had been recorded.
In the Fourth Ward at the same time
103 votes tiad been recorded.
At polling-plnce 2of the Twelfth Ward,
at Green and Larkin street-), at the same
lime, no less than 408 voles were counted
in the books.
Throughout the Third Ward Martin
Kelly flitted in bin buggy, and cast anchor
at all the pollincr-piaces and went in be
hind the ballot-box. He was there to
survey and superintend. AVhat hÂ« saw
may not have occasioned surprise in his
mind, and probably did not, for whatever
the game was he made it. His henchmen
were in all the polling-places and in the
adjoining saloons, whenever there was
any money in sight with which to buy
drinks and cigars. In poiling-places
which no one approached for a long pe
riod the votes for the Kelly delegates
dropped in or were stuffed in. The num
ber of votes was enough to prove the fact
to the proverbial blind horse, to whom a
nod is as good as a wink. In certain cor
ner saloons stuffers were rounded up and
went through the various gradations of
mildly drunk, fully inebriated and up to a
vote-repeating j.ig.
The "primary election" was joshed in
this ward and in other wards as some
thing so perfect in the line of a "fake" as
not to deserve serious consideration.
When there were no voters or repeaters in
sight the pencils flew over the names, and
there may have been a correspondence, in
some cases, between the number of bal
lots picked out of the box when the time
came to call the farce off and t c number
of names checked on the list; but if such
correspondence and agreement occurred
in any case it must have surprised the
men in tbe booth.
At the polling-place on Drurnm street,
near the corner of Sacramento, 187 votes
were reported to be in the box at 3 o'clock.
No tone was in sight for a long time, but
tinaliy rive exactly showed up and threw
in their votes, and then went off together,
presumably to make the circuit. A broad
grin overspread the faces of the men in
the booth as they "checked." At 203 Te
hama street, just off Third, tbe eang gath
erea stesm in a saloon and came in with a
rush, and at 4 o'clock the men in the
booth gave out the astonishing total of
620 votes polled there. At the polling
place near the corner of Natoma and First
streets 600 votes were in at 3 o'clock.
Out in tbe Western Addition thÂ» work
was "raw." At Octavia ant Grove streets,
where hardly a dozen persons went alter
noon, the box tilled up quite stea.iilv. At
Laguna, off Post, there were 405 votes j
when the hour came for calling it a day,
and this neighborhood did not know, ac
cording to good and reliable testimony,
that an election was really under way.
In tne polling-places south of Market
street and out in the Mission everything
was as still and balmy as a June morn.
On the sidewalk the solitary policeman
detailed to see that no uproarious person
disturbed the serenity witbin the booth
nodded in tbe warm afternoon sunshine.
The passers-by Ptopoed and looked in,
saw a box witb glass sides full of folded
paper and t ree or four men sitting
â¢round it penciling down four horizontal
marks, wita a fifth, running diagonally
across them.
Occasionally a roan would come up, get
a ticket from the tally-sheet manipulators
and drop it in tbe box. Frequently a
buggy would roll up to the polling-place
and an individual would spring briskly
out and enter the room. There was a
wholesome air of industry about the busi
ness even if there were no voters. And
tbe votes were tallied all the same.
A reporter looked long and patiently for
the ballot depository advertised as located
at 927 Mission street. Nobody in the im
mediate vicinity could give any informa
tion regarding its whereabouts and even
tne storekeeper next door was in the dark.
"Primary?" be queried in turn, "what
primary? Whose primary?"
Finally he was enlightened and went
back into his shop to digest tne piece of
news. Yet, according to the carefully
BLANKETS! BLANKETS!

written tally-sheets, 330 voters had within
jhree hours exercised the right of suf
iratre.
NÂ«ar the corner of Tenth and Folsom
streets, in a little room adjoining a sa
loon, -x&s a Dallot-box that soon held a
goodly harvest of folded papers â 503 of
them within a short time affer tbe Kellys
ana Mahoneys got at it. Tbe police officer
there said it was the quietest election he
had ever seen. The groceryman on t tie
corner, who said be was lor McKinley,
thought there was a BucKley function
going on the oiher side of the .-aloon.
Four or rive "'vote-of tens" would rendez-
I vous in tne barroom and at intervals they
I would swarm out of iheir hive and add to
tbe load in tho box. Then tne four hori
zontal murks and the one diagonal mark
would go down on the tally-sbeit.
Bond street is a small pocket of a thor
oughfare running south from Mission,
and there 384 ballots were deposited. At
the corner of Twenty-fourth and Church
streets, up among the Mission hills, 230
ballots went into tbe box, and then the
election inspectors so-called shut up shop.
At 3003 Mission street the work went on
industriously and 219 ballots were written
down on tbe sheets, and at the polling
booth corner of Twenty-first and Florida
streets but few persons appeared, but 198
votes were gathered in.
But H was at 727 Brannan street where
the Keilys and Mahoneys covered them
selves with glory. They worked in 540
tallies and voted till they cot tired. But
the baikeeper s-aid it was a dull day with
not a single row. Occasionally a stranger
came up to tbe polls and put in bis ticket,
but tbe same monotonous old gang did
the work of the absent citizens. It was a
great day at 727 Brannan.
The Eighth Ward polled an enormous
vote and yet very few people were seen
during the day about the little room at
514 Geary street where the ener ;etic tally
men were busy checking up whole pages
of the record in advance of a nrial count
that woulu be only a matter of form any
way. At 4:12 p. m. tb;s particular station
had recorded 437 votes cast. The appre
hensive but genial and rotund outpost
who stood conveniently on the sidewalk
imormed an inquiring visitor as he led
him into the place that "things ts kind of
quiet now, Out you ought to have been
earlier." At 4:38, after an absence of no
more than twenty minutes during part of
which the polling-place was kept in sight
and no one observed to enier, the slime vis
itor was then informed that 641 votes had
been cast. And they doubtless had been,
for the piles of carefully f jlu>-d bailo'.s in
side the box appeared to have materially
decreased in size.
It was a dull day in the saloon at the
corner of Pine and Dupont streets, the
polling-place for the Sixti; Ward, and yet
the ballot-box contained untold records of
men who hud been there and deposited a
vote. The proprietor of the place said that
h- had not noticed more ruen U\ih usual
come into his plate, but he thought "may
be twenty or thirty went over into the
back corner where those fellows were
writinc at one of the tables ali day," but
there was a short time during the day
when he was not in the place and perhaps
some more had been ther\
Tbe Fifth Wara polling-place, with com
mendable commercial forethought, was
locnted at 31 butter street, adjacent to Mr.
Spear's auction-room*. At 3:4-5 o'clocK the
clerk* announced that the records, over
which they were then busily at work,
showed that 189 votes had been cast; and
they had an hour and a quarter yet!
The Twelfth Ward, with headquarters
in a little rear adjunct to a saloon at the
corner of Larkin and Pine streets, had its
quota of overworked clerks wiih tired
fingers and aching backs, for up to 2J
minutes after 4 o'clock they had there in
the stilly privacy of that little room
written down the names of 291 voters thai
had Dresumaoiy come there sometime
during the day and exercised the right of
a free American citizen.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lix.. Sept. 15.â wheat crowd
was disappointed this morning, prices not display
ing any buoyancy whatever, but on the contrary
Inclining to sag and decline. Much wheat has
been bought lately on the expectation that a boom
was In process of development, but the evidence
Of a ouUe was fainter this morning than at any
time within a week. Consequently speculators
were disposed to sell out and await a more favor
able occasion. The Maine election was encourag
ing to some, but, as a rule, not a great amount of
importance was attached to It, the result having
been anticipated. Northwestern receipts were
heavy at 1474 cars. against 1395 on the corre
sponding day a year ago. Chicago received 337
cars, and- Inspected out 238k bushels. Liverpool
cub es were all higher. Fxport clearances were
liberal at 385.318 bushels. Bradsireet'* report
on stocks was not Issued to-day. December whea
opened from 60c to 59y B e, decline! to 59y @
69 Vie, closing at 59 Vie, 6/fec under yesterday, hi
timated receipts tor to- norrow 176 cars.
CORNâ Exhibited entire accord with the action
of wheat. There was only the quietest kind of
trade, and nothing savoring of an independent,
movement was sbown. Receipts wer â¢ than
expected, 498 cars arriving where 590 were .â¢;;!â 
mat' d Withdrawals from store were light at
70.000 bushels. Liverpool cables were unchanged
to Vii lower. Export clearances were heavy at
422,458 busbeis May corn opened at 24Â» c, de
clined to 2 4 1/4 (#_'â¢) s ' g c. closing at 2-l.ygC. /g c under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 316
cars.
OATSâ Declined from lack or strengthening In
formation and because of weakness in wheat, ana
corn Features were absent, and a dull monoto
nous market properly explains the situation. Re
ceipts were 566 can. and 19.144 bushels were
tak n from store. port clearances were 61.4 09
bushels. May oats closed */%'.a.y%z lower. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 300 cars.

PROVISIONSâ The speculative atmosphere of

PACIFIC COAST BONDS.
The ordinance adopted by .he Board of Trustees
of the 1 ity of Anaheim providing for tbe issuance
of municipal bonds, speciiii s that the ratio of In
terest aha I be six per cent per annum, payable
semi-, ntiuailr at the office of tbe City Treasurer
of Ananelm on the flr.t day o. December and
June each year, on the surrender of the interest
coupon thereto attached. The bond series will
consi I or 120 bonds, amounting in the aggregate
to 918.000.
Yesterday was the date for the sale of 95500
school bonds of Koclcy View School District in Tu
lare County, these being 8 per cents, the interest
being payable annually. The bonds are of the de
noiu nation of 91100 each, the tirst is payable
January 1, 1902 and one is payable each year
thereafter until nil shall have been paid.
Tiie -mi Bernardino Sun says finally that the
Rialto irritation di.v.r C: will disband The peoule
of tbe district met a few days ago and by a unani
mous vote determined to accept the offer mad â  by
tbe bondholders, which was the necessaiy step to
be taken to reach a decU.ve resuit. The KialU*
irriK&tion district con i.sts o: about 3500 acre* of
land. When it was tirst formed into an irrigation
district it was determined to issue bonds to the
atrount of 9500,000 and to put In a system of irri
gating due Ues, together with a water supply, which
would be unequtileil in >ou thorn California. Of the
total issue of $500,000 94')6.000 are held by
various corporal ionn, while 995,000 never has been
sigued up and delivered. The larger holdings of
bunds are as follows: San Francisco savings
Union, 965,000: S. \V. BtOwaU, Los Angles,
91-0,000; (ierman- American Savings Bank, Los
Angeles, 945,000; Sta c Loan and Trust Com
pany, Los Angeles, 945,000: John Shirley Ward,
Los Angeles, 93 ,000: and J. M. Ptrtle, Los
A ngeies, 910,000. 'lbeoffer .f the bondholders Is
practically this: Thai they wii. take the property
of .he district and surrender the bonds. The bond
homers have formed a corporation aud they will
make tip a.l tbe indebtedness of the district and
get their returns by selling water to tbe ranchers
and fruit-growers of the district, but d aim; with
them as individuals r.i. her than us members of the
district. At the mcc.ing of owners of land fifty
six owners were pr> sent and the sentiment was
entirely favoraDle to accepting the offer which has
been made.
The case of J. B- Ruggles a* assignee of tne es
tate ot J. H. WilÃtis of W inters (this State)
against \V. J. Kannedy and the Bank of Winters
hÂ«s been appealed to the Supreme Court. The case
is said to involve novel points.
The California Paft? Deposit and Trust Company
has tiled wiih the County Recorder oi Sacramento
County a mortgage given to It by the Sacramento
Electric, Gas and kail way Company to secure
tbe payment of 92,000,000. Tne mortgage runs
for thirty y< ars and bears Interest at 6 per cent,
payable semi-annuaily, and the property given as
security cousis. s of all tbe lines of street-railways
in > mm mvii o, with depots, bul dings, rolling
stock, mm hinery, dynamos, all rights, privileges
and franchises, all right and title in the wa er
rlgnt on the American Htver Â»nd all prot>erty
owned in Folsom. The Sacramento Bee explains
that this trarsaction is said to be simply an issue
of new bonds in the name of tbe new consolidated
company to coy- r the bonds outstanding of the
several corporations which were recently consoli
dated.
The Supervisors of San Luis Oblspo County
have adopted the udvlc â¢ given them by special
counsel who was lnÂ»tructtd to investigate the
bonneU indebtedness of the county, and have or
dered that there shall be created four funds.
The=e funds are the County Government Fund,
Act of '91 1 end Fund, the .special i.oad Bond
Sinking Fund and the Political Code Bond Fund.
In accordance witu this plan, and also in pursu
ance of recommendation given by special coun
sel, the sum of 4H4.787 27 has bÂ«en transferred by
order aiiop.ed by the Supervisor* to the credit of
these funds, being apuortioned as follows: Special
ttoad bond Sinkinx Fund, 934,000; Political Code

Old- Fashioned Clerical Jokes.
Few things impressed me more, as a
boy, than the singular notion the wooden
theologians departed had of what was a
joke and an incisive saying. The word
was generally pronounced as though
spelled iu-issive. "D;d you hear," said
one of them to myself, being a youthful
parson, "of the tremendous hit that
Dr. tfahoo gave to Holofernes Mac-
Pusher? He said to Holofernes, 'Are
not you the minister of St. Silas
Fixings?' 'Yes ' 'And your brother of
St. Ananias?' 'Yes.' 'And your father of
St. Sapphira? 1 'Yes. 1 ' 'And your uncle of
Glenstaggers?' 'Yes.' 'And your cousin of
Benstodgie?' 'Yes.' Then Dr. Bahoo pro
ceeded. 1 'I hope you may have as many
friends in the church above as you have in
the church below. 1 It was very cutting
and wonderfully witty." Then my in
formant uttered a loud guffaw, repeatedly
exclaiming 'Ha! ha!" or words to that
effect.
I listened in silence, but songht to put
on an expression of due appreciation of 1
humorous sally. For if I had uttered my
real feeling, which was that here was a
very kind and good wish for Kolofernes,
but that 1 could not for my life see any
thing; either jocular or cutting in the
words used, I should . have made an
assured enemy.â Longman's Magazine.

MOVES BACK INTO
HER LOST HOME
Unhappy Mrs. Fritze Defies
the Law and the
Sheriff.
MAKES A DIRE THREAT
Vainly Imagines That She Will
Be Allowed to Remain in
Possession.
LIFE OF MANY HARDSHIPS.
Moch Bitterness Without a Single
Ray of Brightness to Cheer
Her Existence.
Oaklakd Office Sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 15. I
"If Dameron wants to get me out lie will
have to kill me first," said Mrs. Fritze,
who resides on the corner of Rose and
Grant streets in Berkeley, to-day.
Mrs. Fritze had just done what the
Sheriff had undone when she made the re
mark. On Saturday Marshal Lloyd, armed
with a warrant from the court, was re
quired to evict the wretched little woman.
He went to the house and carried her
Fcant belongings out on the sidewalk, or
rather on the side of the road, for there is
no sidewalk there.
Mrs. Fritze submitted meekly and did
not offer any resistance. She is physically
weak and unable to do any hard work, and
beyond civing an opinion she did nothing
till the Marshal had finished his unpleas
ant task.
But after thinking the matter over Mrs.
Fritze decided that the lock placed on the
door should not keep her out, and tnat she
would go back.
Yesterday she carried out her idea and
moved all of her things Oack, and nor* she
declares that she will hold the fort against
all comers. Mrs. Fritze claims that the
property belongs to Attorney Livingston
of San Francisco, and that he had given
her right of possession. She was put in,
so she says, as a sort of keeper. She found
the property, which consisted of five lots,
in a bad condition, and at once began to
improve it. She cleared ana cultivated
the land, and later secured a couple of
cows. The place did not then afford a liv
ing, and Mrs. Fritze began peddling about
the district. Recently the title of the
property was setiled in court, and the
owner had the old-time tenant removed.
The old lady is well known und lias had
more than her share of trouble in her life.
One time she was comparatively wealthy,
but she was swindled out of every cent,
she says, by the man she married after
coming to San Francisco. Friize got pos
session of her little fortune and then de
terted i er.
The writ of ejection was obtained by J.
P. Dameron, who is now the owner of the
property. The deserted little woman
probably does not mean to carry out her
threat, but she is evidently determined
not to finally leave without a fight.

Town Trustees Meet.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 15.â The Town
Trustees last nieht adopted the draft of a
new license ordinance, drawn in accord
ance with the petition recently presented
by the Merchants' Protectiye Association.
The new law is designed to protect
Berkeley merchants from the competition
of Oakland and San Francisco firms which
send wagons to solicit and 'deliver orders
in Berkeley. No figures have yet been de
cided upon, but it is understood that not
less than $125 per quarter will be charged.
The ordinance will prooably be passed to
print at the next meeting.
A new ordinance was passed to print
making it a misdemeanor for property
owners to allow weeds to prow on the side
walks in front of their property.
A number of protests against macadam
izing certain streets of tne town were en
tered.
Freshmen Elect Officers.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 15.â Tha fresh
man class at the State University held a
wildly enthusiastic and hotly contested
election of class officers to-day, which re
sulted in the election of William E. Saver
of Berkeley as president; Robert Collins
of San Francisco, first vice-president;
Miss Alice Rooney of San Francisco, sec
ond vice-president; Warren Davis of Be!
-mont, secretary, and \V. K. White of San
Francisco, treasurer. Baner received 15^
votes, as against 109 received by Nichols.
Saver is 19 years of age and has lived in
Berkeley all his life. His election to the
office is considered a great victory by tLe
Berkeley contingent. The election was
held at the regular polling place, at North
Hall, from 9 o'clock this morninc until 5
o'clock this afternoon. A feature of the
contest was the lobbying and button
holing, which was carried on to a remark
able extent. The election of Saver to the
presidency resulted in a celebration which
took place in his honor this evening.
"Hushing" Co-eds Discussed-
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 15.â The co
eds of the State University held a meeting
at noon to-day to discuss the question of
passing resolutions condemnin g the young
women students who participated in the
freshman-sophomore "rush" last week. A
j set of resolutions was presented by Miss
i Grace Crabb and Miss Grace Dibble, in
which the action of their sieter co-eds was
strongly condemned.
A hot discussion was precipitated upon
tue reading of the resolutions. Some of
the co-eds thought that they were too se
vere, while others declared that they we r e
not scathing enouph. They talked back
and forth on the subject for half an hour
or more without reaching a decision, when
finally the document was laid on the ta
ble, with the sentiment prevailing that it
should have just a little more red pepper
put into it.
Flenty of Big Men.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 15.â The Uni
versity of California has some unusua!'y
large men in the freshman ciass. Profes
sor Magee of the department of physical
j culture has just completed a report on the
physical measurements of the male
students in the class of "00," which showa
an extraordinary average. The professor
has measured 260 men and says that they
' are, on the whole, taller and heavier than
i the men of preceding classes.
There are iv the class eighteen men
j over six feet in height, the tallest being
6 feet 3 inches. The average weight,
stripped, is 153.6 pounds. Fourteen men
in the clasi weigh over 170, the average oi
the fourteen being 178; average height,
I 5 feet 10}4 inches. The average age of the
{ members of the class is 19 years and 6
months.
Xo More Sashes.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 15.- A com
munication from President Kellogg was
read yesterday afternoon at the freshman
class meeting ordering that backstop
rushes be refrained from in the future.
This edict is looked upon as a forerunner
of an injunction which will cutoff rush
ing of every sort.
This belief is supported by the fact that
a large number of the faculty have taken
a firm stand against this system of sport
among the students. At a recent meeting
of the heads of departments the subject
of rushing came up for discussion and
not a single professor apoke in favor of the
sport, but, on the other band, condemned
it as unbecoming to college men.
Turned From His Old Party.
BERKELEY. Cal., Sept. 15.â Berkeley
has added another prominent man to the
list of those who have turned from the
paths of Democracy and are now carrvine
the banner of Republicanism. Attorney
W. H. Waste, who has voted the Demo
cratic ticket, says that he can neither sun
port Bryan nor the Chicago platform, and
consequently will cast his bailot for Mc-
Kinley.
John W. Flood's Case.
The motion to. dismiss the remaining charges
against John W. Flood, the imprisoned cashier
of Donohoo.Kelly <tCo.. will be heard in Judge
Wallace's court on Friday.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1896.
PENSION MONEY
BROUGHT HARMONY
Lieutenant Meehan and His
Wife Agree to a Re
conciliation.
HAPPY END TO STRIFE.
Two Pretty Children Helped
Largely to Bring About
the Result.
AIL LITIGATION CALLED OFF.
Keeping House Alone Is but a Poor
Apology for Wife and

Oaklanp Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 1Â». f
Lieutenant Meehan and his wife are
united. With his pension came a recon-
LIEUTENANT MEEHAN and His Wife, Who Have Decided
That a Happy Home Life With Their Children Is More De
sirable Than a Solitary Existence Without Their Little Ones*
ciliation and it is understood that all the
litigation instituted between them will be
dropped.
The announcement that the lieutenant
and his attractive wife, who is much
youneer than he, are once more living in
harmony under the same roof will cause
great surprise among their numerous ac
quaintances. According to the old vet
eran's story the last pension money was
tne cause of the trouble and the Govern
ment remittance received yesterday was
the cause of the reconciliation.
To a reporter a few weeks ago Lieuten
ant Meehan credited an actor with being
the cause of his troubles, but he now ad
mits that be was wrong. Many unpleas
ant things were said on both sides, but
there were two pretty little children to be
considered, and both father and mother
were anxious to be appointed their guar
dians.
Since his wife went away Lieutenant
Meehau engaged a housekeeper, but all
did not go smoothly and both were ar
rested a few days ago and charged with
disturbing the peace of the landlord.
Mrs. Prescott. secretary of the Children's
Society, also put in a claim to be the lit
tle ones' guardian, and as husband n.nd
wife made so many counter-charges her
petition would probably have been
granted. This did not suit either Lieu
tenant or Mrs. Meehan and so helped to
unite them.
Yesterday Lieutenant Meehan received
his regular pension of $72 50 a quarter, as
he is fully disabled and is a cripple con
fined to a wheel-chair. Soon after the
money arrived Mrs. Meeban put in an ap
pearance. They shared the money and
agreed to again share their joys and sor
rows.
A little later they went to West Oakland
to rent a cottage, where they intend to
live happily and at peace henceforth.
Their little ones have rejoined them, and
they are rejoicing even more than their
parents over the reconciliation. All the
cases now in court will be withdrawn,
and, profiting by the experience of the
past few months, the lieutenant and his
wife will try to forget that they ever disa
greed.

SOUGHT RICHES IN DEATH
Suicide of a Bright Young Lad
Surrounded With Poverty
and Misery.
Fred Mauerhan B3 ieved That the
Future Would Recompense for
Present Hardships.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cali,,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 15. J
Fred Mauerhan, a lad 16 years old, shot
himself to-night because he feared he
would always be poor. Mauerhan was a
very industrious boy ami delivered milk
for Joseph Yaeger of Fruitvale. On sev
eral occasions recently he has told his em
ployer that If there were no prospects of a
man setting rich he had better be dead.
The lad lived, with John Baery on Upper
High street. He went over his route to
day twice, as usual, and when he returned
to-night he handed over his collections.
He tt.en went to the little room off the
parlor where he slept. He was absent a
long time when Baery heard a shot. On
Koinp to the parlor Baery saw Mauerhan
on the floor dead. The boy used to share
the bed with Baery and t' c latter kept a
pistol ueneath his pillow. Frert had taken
the pistol and shot himself in the head.
There was but one cartridge in the re
volver and its effect had been instantan
eous.
Mauerhan's mother lives at Frnitvale
and has three young children. She is
very r>oor and frequently the pangs of
hunger and poverty have been severely
felt. His father is a veteran and is crip
pled. He is an inmate of the Veterans'
Home at Napa.
Altogether Fred thought his lot too
hard, and seeing no brighter prospect
ahead he resolved to end it. When dis
cussing his circumstances ho frequently
said that in the future world those who
were poor i ere would be rich, and strong
in this hope ho lircd the fatal shot.

DON'T WANT TO FUSE.
Unavailing: Attempt of the Committee
to Hold a Meeting.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 15.â The Demo
cratic and Populist fusion committee have
tried for two nights to hold a conference, j
but in vain. Last night and to-night at- ,
tempts have been made to get a quorum,
but a sufficient camber did not appear on
either occasion.
Although an attempt is being made to
make it appear that the fusion project is
entirely satisfactory and harmonious to
both parties, such is fur from being the
case. The rank and file of the Populists
are opposed to fusion, and there is mucn
dissension. A month ago tho attendances i
at the fusion conferences were so numer- i
ous that all could not find place in
the meeting-room. Latterly the members '
and interest have decreased, and there are
not enough of the conference committees
available to make a quorum. They will i
try it again to-morrow night.
NEW QUARTERS.
The Postofflce May Be Moved Into the
Albany Hotel Block When the
Present LeÂ»Â«e Expires. .
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 15.â The lease of
the building in which the postoffice is now
located will expire with this month, and
negotiations are now under way for other
quarters. Of four bids received the most
accessible and best fitted ion tne purposa
is that of the offer of the protmd floor of
the Albany Hotel building, at Broadway
and Fifteenth street.
The building is of brick and the rooms
offered are on the corner, and two blocks
nearer the business part of the city. It
will make the best rooms for the purpose
that the local office has ever had.
"Wild Girl" Missing.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept 15.â Little
Bessie, "the wild girl of the hills," can
not be found, and the search for her
parents is now suspended while efforts are
being made to locate her whereabouts. The
stories of cruel treatment received at the
hands of Jean Fortier are increasing.
Besides being forced to be out in all
kinds of weather on the Contra Costa hills,
Abe neighbors say she was shamefully
beaten by the old man and his two daugh
ters.
Successful Conference.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 15.â The con
ference which has been held the past two
days at the Tenth-avenue Baptist Church

BOXING AND WRESTLING,
Tom Tracey, the Australian, Ar
rived Yesterday From
New York.
Dan Creedon Will Fight Any Man,
Barring Fitzsimmcns and
Corbett.
Tom Tracey, the Australian fighter, who
whipped Billy Gallagher in this City some
years ago just after his arrival in this
country from Australia, made his long
expected appearance yesterday at Young
Mitchell's emporium of sport
Tracey journeyed from New York and
arrived on the overland train, which was
four hours late. John Morrissey, the
popular theatrical manager, will look after
Tracey's interests. Morrissey has secured
the services of that competent trainer,
Billy Delaney of Oakland, who will condi
tion Tracey for his contest with George
Green, which is slated for the evening of
the 30th inst at Woodward's Gardens
under the auspices of the Occidental Club.
Although Tracey is looking tolerably
well there is much room for improvement
in his condition. He contends that the
journey over the plains and mountains
did not benefit him at all, as he could not
sleep well en route. He is anxious for a
postponement of the contest until about
the 10th of October, so that be will have
no reason to offer an excuse for his defeat
in case Green should best him. But Green
will have something to say regarding a
postponement, and that matter will in all
probability be decided to-day. Young
Mitchell eacoried Tracey to a prominent
photograph gallery yesterday afternoon,
where an artist shot at the pugilist as the
latter was dressed in his best fighting
gear. A pood picture of the clever Aus
tralian is hoped for in a day or two.
TraÂ«y says that Dan Creedon has about
concluded to travel West, as the r>rospect3
of "pulling off" fights in New "York are
not as brilliant as the fancy of managers
of boxing clubs, notwithstanding that the
Horton bill is now in effect.
Creedon would like to mix fists with
Greggains, Jeffries, Van Buskirk or any of
the heavy-weights, barring Corbett and
Fitzaimmons.
The contest between Tracey and Green,
granting that the men will toe the scratch
in good condition, should prove to be as
good a race as the lovers of good sport
have seen in this City in many years.
Charley Turner, the colored pugilist of
Stockton, and Arthur Walker, the Aus
tralian, have been signed also by the Occi
dental Club. They will bow to the people
on the evening that Tracey and Green de
cide a little question of who is the better
man ; that is, pugllistically speaking, of
course.
The carnival committee has decided to
eive a boxing exhibition for the benefit of
the carnival some evening next month.
Young Mitchell is seriously thinking of
giving, as a preliminary to Billy Jordan's
"event of the evening," a high-kicking
match between two prominent French
men, who are said to be very conversant
with the great French game of la savate.
A contest of this kind would certainly
prove far mor.- interesting than a fistic
bout between two local duffers who know
not the first thing about the manly art.
The National Club telegraphed Corbett
yesterday that he must do business with
the club, as it has no agent in this City and
that if he is really sincere in his desire to
fipht Sharkey, it will give a purse of
$10,000 for a ten-round contest, or the same
amount for a finish fight
The Rio Athletic Club of Rio Vista will
give an entertainment on Saturday even
ing next, the programme for which has
already been published in The Call.
The sports of Los Gats will have an
opportunity of seeing some distinguished
fistic artists this evening, as an exnibition
will be held in the City of the Cats. The
event of the evening will be a four-round
bout between Professor Jack Davis of
Omaha and Professor Burgand, late of
New York. Some good, hara hitting
should certainly result.
The wrestlers, Butler of the Olympic
Club and Williamson of the Acme" Club,
have signed a contract to wrestle best two
out of three falls, catch-as-catch-can, in
the near future.
On Friday evening next the Davis- Platt
wresting match will be decided at the
Columbia Club, 1108 Golden Gate avenue.
The match is for the feather-weight cham
pionship and is exciting interest.
Sam Fitzpatrick, the manager of George
Layigne "the kid," writes from New York
to the sporting editor of The Call as fol
lows:
I tried hard to arrange a contest In Frisco,
but for some reason I can't find a man who is
willing to meet "the kid." I wonder what
i? the reason. I am negotiating for another
trip to England and if satisfactory arrange
ments can be made i will leave for there about
the middle of March next. I want a return
match with Burge if I can get it. In the mean
time I shall probably make a match witli Ever
hardt, to take place ttie latter part of next
month. I guess "the kid" won't experience
much trouble in "pushing his lace in" nil
right. I went to see Sullivan and Sharkey
spar and concluded that Sharkey was a pretty
strong fellow.

Dr. Thomas Fiaschi, just arrived at the

home to Sydney, Australia, tells the fol
lowing graphic story of the barbarous
cruelties practiced by the Abyssinians upon
hundreds of soldiers made captive at the
time of the overwhelming defeat of the
Italian army last March t>y the forces of
King Menelik. A surgeon of repute in
Australia for twenty years and an Italian
by birth, he hastened at once to Africa

upon the receipt of the news of the
slaughter of Italians at jflowa to reuder
surgical aid, and insiue of fourteen days
he performed 140 amputations upon
wounded and mutilated soldiers.
I found two groups of woundea soldiers in
Abyssinia, different from the type of gunshot
and cold-steel wounds familiar to military sur
geons in civilized warfare. The first group,
a large one, consisted of black soldiers in
the Italian service, who, having Deen made
prisoners by the forces of King Menelilr, had
the right hand and the left foot cut off; the
second, a mticn smaller number of cases, vu
formed chiefly of Italian soldiers who had sur
vived dastardly private mutilations. These
two forms of mutilation are characteristic of
an Abyssinian campaign.
It was a most impressive sight to see about
the Improvised infirmary all those fine, ath
letic-looking black young men, about 300 In
number, hopping smartly about on their right
foot, or sitting down on the turf, nursing their
bandaged stumps.
Oh. March 1, after the disastrous battle of
Abba Carima, these soldiers and hundreds of
others wero made prisoners. On the follow
ing day several of the high chiefs begged King
Menelik to have them mutilated, but here
fused. On March 3 a great court-martial was
held, and chiefs of tribes, Queen Taitu herself,
and the head of the Abyssinian clergy, pleaded
with the King to enforce the penalty of the
urusatâ the removal of the neht hand and
the left foot.
King Menelik is a weak man, and he
yielded. The execution took place at once,
and not as usual by the hand of the execu
tioner, who has a certain skill from practice,
but by that of soldiers who went at it in an ad
ditionally cruel manner, using their swords
and wrenching the joints open. Fifteen hun
dred hardy young soldiers were so mutilated
at that time.
Now, when this mutilation Is adopted for the
punishment of theft the sufferer is allowed to
i>!ungo ais stumps into boiling butter to stop
tho bleeding; but with these prisoners this
was strictly forbidden, and once the mutila
tion wes completed they were freed and left to
themselves. As a result, many scon bled to
death. Many more crowded to a neighboring
torrent, where the Mohammedans, in despair
and intense suffering, drowned themselves in
a deep waterhole. Those that were able to
bandage themselves with portions of their
robe survived. For many days they lived on
grass and water. When the news reached the
Italian lines a great number of wives of the
mutilated, with the speed of leg peculiar to
these people, rushed to Adowa, ana many of
the survivors owe their lives to the fact that
for miles they were carried on the back by
their wives to the nearest Italian outpostâ a
fine example of womanly devotion.
Of the 330 mutilated returned to the Italian
lines 189 of them had so far healed that an
amputation was not considered necessary.
There are yet mutilated Askari turning up at
the hospitals of Keren and Asmara every week,
but, all told, it is reckoned by good authorities
that out of the 1500 mutilated of Adowa there
cannot be more than 500 survivors. The re
maining 1000 bled to death or succumbed to
suffering and starvation.
COAL DISCOVERED
The Teln to Be Explored by the Sla
vonian Catholic Colony in Men
docino County.
Rev. Father Jeram, president and direc
tor of the Slavonian Catholic colony in
Eden Valley, Mendocino County, was in
the City yesterday. He reports that a
rich vein of coal was discovered by a party
of the colonists last Saturday and much
importance is attached to the discovery.
The vein will be explored and a quantity
of the coal mined and tested to determine
its real quality and usefulness as fuel.
Not long since copper was discovered on
the colony tract and further prospecting is
in progress.
There is a sawmill operated by the
colony, which turns out 12,000 feet of
lumber daily. Affairs in Eden Valley are
reported to be in a prosperous condition.

HIS DEFENSE HAS
BEEN PRESENTED
Oliver Winthrop's Counsel
Says His Client Is Not
Guilty.
THE END OF THE CASE.
W. S. Barnes for the Prosecu
tion Will Argue This
Morning.
CAMPBELL IS VERY COHFIDENT
Sure of Convicting the Han Who
Lured Him to the California-
Street Cottage-
Another day and the trial of Oliver W. |
Winthrop will have reached its conclu- j
sion. All the testimony has been pre- j
sented to the jury, the prosecution has j
mrde its opening address and the defense
has offered its argument. All that re
mains to be done n-w is for the prosecu- j
tion to close the arguments tnis morning,
when Judge Wallace will charge the jury ;
and they will retire to agree upon a ver
dict.
TheWinthropcaseisoneof the strangest
ever presented to any court in this State.
It is entirely built on circumstantial evi
dence and the defendant accuses his chief
accuser of being the criminal in the al
leged kidnaping and robbery of Millionaire
Campbell.
The defendant was again placed on the
stand to rebut the testimony of Sergeant
Taylor, who testified at a previous hear
ing that he had known Winthrop under
aliases while in the army.
Winthrop testified he first enlisted in
1876. He was discharged in 1881. The
document produced corroborated the state
ment. The witness never at any time
gave a fictitious name, according to his
testimony.
Assistant Attorney Black opened the
argument for the prosecution, reviewing
the case from the time, according to the
testimony, that W T inthrop laid the plans
to kidnap Campbell, followed him to San
Jose and finally landed him in chains in
the California-street cottage.
Attorney Black outlined the case with
out goinu into the details, leaving that to
W. S. Barnes, the District Attorney, who
is expected to close the case for the prose
cution this morning.
Attorney Bell, for the defense, attacked
the veracity of Urquhart, the man who
claimed lo be Winthrop's friend, and to
whom lie was said to have confided his
schemes to kidnap people of means for
tlie purpose of ransom.
"This man Urquhart," said Bell, "claims i
he had knowledge of the proposed kidnap
ing of his friend Campbell. He rented a
house in which the deed was to be con
summated and waited for a victim. He j
saw this victim and Winthrop walking
along Montgomery street to the cars on
their way to the cottage, and still he never
raised his voice againÃt the crime.
"Such testimony, gentlemen of the jury,
should be regarded with distrust.
"It is improbable that Winthrop, so well
known in the neighborhood where the al
leged crime occurred, would have engaged i
a house there for tne purpose, and it is i
still more improbable he would have gone j
to Agent Speck, a man whose acquaint- j
ance has been his for years.
"The testimony of the landlady of the I
house is likewise unreliable. She remem- j
bers, at first, that a man named Archibald
came to her and paid a deposit for the
rent after heÂ«had visited the nouse and
been in her company many minutes, per
haps an hour or more, on a couple of occa- i
tions. Subsequently she was confronted j
with the defendant and failed to recognize
nim. Later, when under the persuasive i
influence of the police, she managed to
remember that the man she couid not rec- j
ogmze immediately after the crime was |
really the villain the police depicted him
to be.
"As for the testimony of Campbell, the
Hawaiian millionaire, it is contradicted by
that of several witnesses. He claims that
on the night of Aueust3 he saw the de
fendant at his bedside in the California
street cottage. Three renntable witnesses
testify that at the very moment Winthrop
is claimed by Campbell to have been with
him he (Winthrop) was in thelodgerooms I
of some fraternal societies or on the streets
of this City with them.
"As to the defendant's inability to ac
count for every moment of his time," con
tinued Bell, "I will ask you, gentlemen
of the jury, which one among you can
think over a period of days and state ex
actly where you were at a given hour?
"The testimony given by Samuel G.
Taylor is entitled to no credence whatso
ever. Believing his statement that the
defendant was a member of the United
States army under two aliases, Winthrop
must have enlisted when he was a mere
boy of 14 years of age. I say that it is a
pure lie.
"There have been ship captains with
the lives of hundreds of passengers de
pending on their judgment to bring them
and their Bhip safely into port. Their
ships have gone ashore and harm hascome.
No one can possibly say with reason that
these captains maliciously wrecked their
vessels. No, an error of judgment was
made. So is it with tnis defendant. He
made an error of judgment when he went
out of thin City at the suggestion of
Urqubart, who told him to keep in hiding
until the trouble should blow over.
"Wintbrop had previously been accused,
apprehended and placed in jeopardy lor a
crime of which he was proveJ innocent.
He did not want to be again persecuted
by the police, leaving his wife and chil
dren to suffer for months on account of his
unjust incarceration; hence, he removed
himself to where he believed he could be
safe while still near enough to them to be
their provider."
W. S. Barnes will address the jury this
morning. _^__^__^_^___

FISTICUFFS IN
OPEN COURT
J. P. Langhorne Slaps the
Face of William H.
H. Hart.
GUILTY OF CONTEMPT.
Ordered to Appear Before Judge
Ccffey To-Day for Pun
ishment
NO ONE IS FATALLY INJURED
Missing Papsrs in the H nly Case
the Cause of Trouble Between
the Men.
What promised to be a contest for the
San Francisco attorneys' championship in
fisticuffs occurred yesterday in Judge Cof
fey's court Lawyer J. P. Langhorne landed
Ex-Attorney-General Hart Getting His Face Slapped by Attorney
Langhorne in Judge Coffey's Court.
his right duke on Counselor W. H. H.
Hart's jaw and would probably have fol
lowedwith a left swing, had not ClerK Mar
tin and Major Mhoon interposed a restrain
ing order. As it was, Judge Coffey landed a
soaker on Langhorne by adjudging him j
guilty of contempt of court, and Hart, un
der cover of the judicial diversion, got out
of range of his opponent's ready right.
The trouble occurred because of a con
troversy over the papers in the Jcshua
Hendy estate.
There has been bad blood between the
lawyers for some time. Kart represents
the nephews of the deceased, who are ex
ecutors of his will. Langhorne is the legal
adviser of Mrs. Josephine Green, a sister
of the executors, who was cut off in the
will but was subsequently awarded a $20,000
share in the estate. She is now trying to
have the executors removed, claiming they
are mismanaging and wasting the prop
erty.
Some time ago an inventory of the es
tate was missed from tne County Clerk's
office and Langhorne was very angry
about it. He did not say Hart knew of
the whereabouts of the document, but his
manner irritated that practitioner,
regarded it as accusing. The paper was
eubsequently found. Yesterday the Hen
dy matter was up in the Probate Court.
Langhorne reported to Judge Coffey that
Mrs. Green's amended opposition to the
will was missing and asked leave to file a
copy.
Hart objected vigorously. "There has
already been too much talk about missing
papers in this case," said be.
Langhorne turned on his opponent and
asked sharply : "Do you mean to insinu
ate that what I say about this paper be
ing missing is untrue?"
"Yes, it is untrue,'"' snapped Hart in
reply.
Langhorne immediately lunged at the
other lawyer, but only succeeded in slap
ping his face with his open hand. Before
either had a chance to go any further
they were restrained and Judge Coffey at
once declared Langhorne guilty of con
tempt of court. His punishment will be
fixed this morning at 11 o'clock, when he
is ordered to appear.

FRED DINGLE'S CRIME.
An Effort Made to Punish Him on
Kelony Charges.
At the regular meeting of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association yester
day there were present President Sonntag
and Directors Kerr, Mead, Sbarboro,
Crocker ana Derniium. The president re
ported that ex- Assistant Secretary F. H.
Dingle had been sentenced to six months'
imprisonment in the County Jail for
petty embezzlement lor stealing the asso
ciation's funds.
Director Sbarboro was of the opinion
that the punishment was not sufficient, as
the fellow had been Rtealing from the
funds for several months, until the total
had reached over ?SOO. He offered a reso
lution that the president appoint a special
committee whose duty should be to en
iea: c special counsel and prosecute Dingla
on i he other charges. Mr. Sbarboro Â«aid
th^l tbe offense was too grave for Din^e
to escape so easily. If justice could not be
obtained in the Police Court the case
sliouKl be presented to the Grand Jury.
Director Crocker-favored taking the case
to the latter body. After the matter had
been discussed at length it was found that
with one exception, the one on which
Dingle was convicted, all the embezzle
ments were of a petty order and upon
which Dingle could not be prosecuted for
a felony. In this way Mr. Sbarboro's res
olution failed to pass.
A YOUNG WIFE'S SUICIDE,
Mrs. E. L. Hays Takes Her Life
With a Dose of Carbolic
Acid
She Preferred D ath to a Lonely Life
Away From Her Husband.
Left a Little Baby.
Mrs. E. L. Hayes, a young and pretty
wife and mother, in a moment of sorrow
and despair, took her own life by drinking
carbolic acid, at 421 Fourth street, last
evening.
She committed the deed before her hus
band's eyes, and he, stricken with remorse
and almost insane with grief, paces the
floor of his apartments.
Hay*, who is a plumber and gasfitter,
and his wife had a quarrel about three
weeks ago, which culminated in a separa
tion. Mrs. Hays, who is but 18 years of
ace, went to live in an apartmeni.house
on Market street, ne?~ Valencia." She
tried to obtain employment, but was un
successful, and last Monday, in order to
reduce expenses, moved to more humble
quarters, at 1141 MarKet street.
She moved her trunk and baggage to her
new home, but it is evident that after
spending one day there she tired of her
lonely life and determined to ask forgive
ness of her husband.
Mrs. Hays was tbe mother of a little
girl 2 years of age, which remained, after
the separation, in its father's care. She
called at her old home for the purpose of
seeing her child and incidentally her hus
band. He entered the room in wnich the

TWO PECULIAR BILLS.

NATIONAL LEAGUE MEETING.
A Large Audience Containing Many
Women Attended to Hear
the Speakers.
The rooms of the National Republican
League were crowded last nicht with an
attentive audience, a large proportion of
which was composed of ladies. Senator
Tirey L. Ford, president of the league,
called the meeting to order.
In his opening remarks Senator Ford
spoke of the necessity for California to
join the Republican ranks and thus be in
condition to fully share the benefits to
flow from a Republican administration.
He referred to the Maine election and the
lesson to be drawn from it.
"Maine," said Mr. Ford, "continually
returns four able men to Congress, who,
from their long service, have acquired a
commanding influence at Washington not
possessed by any other State in the Union,
and greater than the influence of all the
States west of the Rocky Mountains com
bined.
One of Maine's Representatives is Speak
er of the House and chairman of the Com
mittee ou Rules, another is chairman oi
the Ways and Means Committee, and thus
the leader of the House; another is at the
head of the Committee on Naval Affairs,
and the remaining one is chairman of the
J Committee on Public Buildings and
I Grounds. California, with seven Repre
sentatives, has but one member, Mr. Loud,
who has reached the chairmanship of a
tirst-ciass committee.
"The trouble lies with California. By
continually changing our Representatives
in Congress we lose the influence we would
otherwise have."
Senator Ford's remarks were loudly
applauded, after which he introduced
Judge J. A. Waymire, who made a sound
and well-worded address on the necessity
of protection for the products of tne
I. United States.
Colonel John P. Jackson made a witty
speech, which was frequently interrupted
with applause. He began with the propo
sition that there was something about
Republicanism that kept its votaries
younginheart.no matter how old they
might be. Some ot them who marched
under Sheridan and Grant are as young
as they ever were.
Tiie Bryan wing of the Democratic party
weut to Chicago in a Democratic wagon
and came back in a Democratic hearse.
The speaker paid his respects to the Popu
lists. They mipht not be anaichintic or
socialistic, he said, but they bad a plank
that every anarchist and socialist and â
foolist in the country stands upon. It
drew to it all the fads and frauds and
freaks in the country because that was
tne only platform on which they could
stand. They thought that they could
make wealth by legislating values, but
tin-*' could not do that any more than they
could make good health contagious.
One of tiie .Populist speakers uad said that
God put into the earth gold and silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1. and that that ought
to be the standard. Th? opposition to the
issuance of bonds was unreasonable be
cause Popalist3 as well as others want
the Nicaragua canal built, ami it cannot
be done without the issue of $100,000,000
in bonds.
Populists turned down the gifted John
J. Ingalls and in his place they sent the
bewhiskered Peffer. They were doin^
chimerical things always. Senator But
ler of North Carolina introduced a bill to
make the trade dollar and the Japanese
yen a legal tender for debt. The trade
doliar was r jected by the heathen and
was returned to our mints. Yet the Popu
lists demand that these dollars that the
heathen would not receive should be paid
to our farmers and our laborers.
Representative Hartman of Montana
got up on the floor of Congress one day
and said that he knew a Populist member
in the ,Hou?e at that moment who had
three bills in his pocket ready for intro
duction. One was to cross the strawberry
and the milicweed so that the farmers
couid have strawberries and cream; an
other bill proposed an appropriation to
cross the bee and the lightning-bu-, so
that the bees could gather honey at night.
The deplorable state of Kansas was a
cood illustration of the evils oi Populism.
Mary Ellen Lease said: "Now you have
pot the State all you have to do is to raise
hell," and there has been an overproduc
tion in that Slate ever since. Kansas has
fallen behind in prosperity and population
while Missouri and Nebraska have forged
ahead.
The speaker denounced the anarchistic
methods of Governor Altgeld and his asso
dates and closed with a beautiful tribute
to the Republican party.
Songs were sung by the Knickerbocker
quartet.
FOR CHAIRMAN.
Thomas D. Riordan, a Native Son,
Will Probably Be Chosen.
Thomas D. Riordan, gentleman, scholar,
attorney-at-law and Native Son, is favor
ably spoken of in connection with the
chairmanship of the Republican munici
pal convention, which will meet next
Tuesday evening. Mr. Riordan is a Re
publican of liie-lonir standing, one who
has always been found willinc to help the
party in stormy as well as sunny weather.
He has hosts of friends who would be very
well pleased to see him preside over the
convention.
WITH THE HOWARD CLUB
Pythian Castle Resounded With
Melody and Oratory Last
Evening.
Rousing Speeches by Ju-ge W. W.
Allen and Others â Po:m,
"Bryan's Raving."
Pythian Castle resounded with melody
and oratory last evening when the How
ard Republican Club began its twenty
third regular meeting within its walls.
The assembly hall had been tastefully and
gorgeously decorated until it was a beauti
ful bower of colored bunting. Music was
furnished by the Golden Gate orchestra of
eighteen pieces and the McKinley quartet,
composed of Messrs. Davies, Hart, Rich
ard and Cliff.
After the regular business of the club
had been transacted Secretary Thomas F.
Graham offered a resolution condemning
the action of the Board of Equalization
for raising the assessment of the City and
County of San Francisco. It was unani
mously adopted.
Judge W. W. Allen was introduced, and
he gave one of his telling talks upon the
silver theory and the Bryan fallacy. At
the close of his enthusiastic speech he
asked permission to read the following
pertinent parody:
Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered
weaK and weary on my quiet cnamber floor;
while I drowsed there, on the night air, came
a voice from out the somewhere, penetiating,
silence-breaking, shaking Â»H my chamber
floor. "Twas The Bryan, William Bryan, shak
ing thus my chamber floor, talking, talking
evermore.
"Bryan," said I, quite emphatic, "Populist
or Democratic, whether fate or silver-miners
sent thee to my chamber door; dost thou think
that I am daunted at thy red flap, ever flnunted,
o'er this l*nd by silver haunted? Tell me
truly, I imploreâ is thi-re money in it for you,
tell meâ tell me, I implore.
"Bryan," said I, "thing of talking, who
throuph West and East is stalkingâ by the
rhetoric that thou lovest, by thy talk thou
dust adoreâ tell this land with parties laden if
within that distant Aidenn where you prom
ise us prosperity, Ilku silver, is ealoreâ will
our money be more plenty? Do we work eight
hours or twenty?â tell us, Bryan, William
Bryan â will uur hard times then be o'er?"
Did he answer? Nevermore.
And the Bryan, never weary, through the
day nnil dnrimess dreary, still is talking,
talking nonsense never nation heard Defore;
pours his fallacies outflowi. g as he travels
eastward going, o'er the waste of W Westernr estern
prairies to the wave- washed Jersey shore, in a
prand triumphal progress to the open White
House door. Will he enter? Nevermore.
Addresses were made by J. F. Gaw
thorne, H. Kincaid, F. McGregor, Frank
Kelly and others, and ihe audience was
favored with campaign airs by the quartet.
THIRTY-SIXTH DISTRICT.
To Abolish the Office of the Board
of Equalization.
A large and enthusiastic meeting was
held last evening by the Thirty-sixth As
sembly District at Twin Peaks Hall.
Jud.e Grofzinger, Attorney Schooler and
John S. Enos, who drew instructive les
sons from Vermont and Maine with her
elorious 50,000 majority, were the speak
ers.
Resolutions were adopted condemning
the action of the Board or Equalization in
increasing the assessment of the City and
pledging the candidates to the Legislature
to advocate the abolition of the board.

Planning for a Pil

WILL CALL ON M'KINLEY
Negotiations Are Already Well
Under Way for the Pro
jected Trip.
HUNDREDS ANXICUS TO GO.
An Endeavor to Be Made to Have
A.I of California's Many Inter
ests Represented.
California Republicans are preparing to
demonstrate their patriotism, and their
adhesion to that policy of protection which
is so largely conducive to progress and
prosperity, in a unique and mojt em
phatic manner.
A few weeks may see one or more special
trains, carrying between 100 and 200 enth
usiastic leading Republicans, speeding
across the continent from California, bound
for Canton, Onio, the Mecca of all true
and loyal members of the party that gave
the country a Lincoln, a Grant and scores
of other illustrious statesmen and patriots
within the last generation.
The idea of the pilgrimage is to convey
to Major William McKiniey the loyal sen
timents of California's Republicans, to
assure him of their united support, and
incidentally to call to his attention the
many and varied interests of the State that
will be benefited by the resumption of tne
tariff fathered by this famous Ohioan.
Colonel J. T. Ritchey of Los Angeles
conceived the scheme last July, but when
it was first submitted to the Southern Pa
cific officials in this City it was thought to
be too big a thing to be carried to a suc
cessful consummation, and it was allowed
to sink into oblivion.
But, despite the fact that the encour
agement and co-operation of i he railroad
people was withheld, tne plan toot a
strong hold on the originator and his
friends. Among those who became most
active in the matter were Colonel H. G.
Oti- of the Los Angeles Times and G. J.
Griffith. The Canton Excursion Associa
tion was formed and Mr. Griffith became
its energetic secretary.
One of the methods adopted to arouse
interest in the scheme was to send a cir
cular letter to the chairman of each Re
publican couniy committee, requesting
him to send to the association the names
of not less than twenty-five prominent
and influential Republicans who would be
likely to interest themselves in the project.
It was suggested that the names be se
lected from those who represented the
following interests: Agricultural, mining,
lumber, sheep- raising, wool-growing, cat
tle-raising, fruit- raising, irrigation, grape
growing, raisin-iuaKing, sugar-beet rais
ing, railroad transportation, ocean ship
ping, g. neral commercial, mercantine,
manufacturing, petroleum and Nicaragua
canal.
When these lists had been received be
tween 1700 and 2000 individual invitations
were sent out by Secretary Griffith, and
the responses showed a remarkably strong
desire on the part of many to join in the
proposed excursion. These replies came
irom all over the State, and showed equal
enthusiasm in the north and in the south.
John M. Crowley, the assistant general
passenger and freight agent of the South
ern Pacific at Los Angeles, on the 3d inst.
again called the attention of his superior
in ban Francisco to the matter, detailing
ail the above facts and developments.
This time his efforts bore fruit. He was
instructed to consult with Mr. Byrne, the
general passenger atrent of the Southern
California Railway, for the purpose of
securing his consent to a rate of $72 50 to
Ctncaco and return, providing not less
than 100 persons agreed to take the trip.
This was readily obtained, and General
Passenger A.ent T. Ji. Goodman of the
Southern Pacific, on the 14th inst., placed
the matter in the hands of B. D. Cald
well, chairman of the Transcontinental
Passenger Association, to be presented for
the consideration of the members of the
association. Mr. Goodman's telegram to
Mr. Caldwell was as follows:
Please present following for immediate at
tention and earliest possible action: Presented
with approval of Mr. Kyrne of the Southern
California Railway. We ask privilege of nam
ing #72 50 rate from California points to Chi
cago and return for party traveling together,
destination canton, Oliio. Said party to be
not less than 100 persons, going East via
Ogden, returning via Santa Ke. DBte ot depar
ture not yet decided. Tickets to be for con
tiguous trip, witn only sufficient time to
accommodate delegation wishing to call upon
Republican nominee at Canton. This rate to
be used in connection with such rate as will be
granted for same party from Chicago to Canton
and return. Undoubtedly large additional
number would join party at points east of
California. This is a peculiar request incident
to the times, and will ask th.it California
terminal lines be allowed to agree hereafter
upon time limit. Kindly acknowledge receipt.
It is expected that Mr. Caldwell will
carry on all negotiations with the mem
bers of the Transcontinental Passeneer
Association by telegraph, and a reply may
be looked for any day.
In Mr. Crowley's latest letter to Good
man he expresst-d the opinion that there
would probably be 200 who would take ad
vantage of the opportunity to make a
quick and cheap jaunt to Canton and re
turn.
At the present time the Pennsylvania
Railroad is carrying excursion parties
from Chicago to Canton and yeturn for
$4 50, less than one-quarter the regular
rate. But this extrenu-ly low rate requires
the excursionist to go and come on the
same day. Tickets allowing three days
for the return trip are sold ior $9 15, half
the regular rate.
It is proposed to make the pilgrimage in
& way to do honor to California and to the
man it is intended to visit. There will be
bands of music on the trains, the coaches
will be handsomely and profusely decor
ated and ample supplies of California
products, such as fruits and wines, will be
taken alone so that the reputation of the
Golden State for unexcelled hospitality
may be fully and ably ma ntained.
THE IRONWORKERS.
To Be Addressed Next Saturday
Night by Irving M. Scott.
Irving M. Scott, California's bui.'der of
battle-ships, will address the ironworkers
of California in the Auditorium, corner of
Eddy and Jones 3treets, next Saturday
night. All ironworkers in the State are in
vited to attend. Mr. Scott pioposes to
show them that they are more interested
in protection and sound money than the
Democratic press would have them believe.
Special Meeting for Members.
The club members of tue Thirty-ninth
Assembly District will hold a special

BROKE HIS LEG.
Frank Kagleson, the Shirt Merchant,
Is Jfow Confined to His
Boom.
Frank Eagleson, the shirt
manufacturer and prominent member of
the St. George's Club, met with a very un
fortunate accident on Sunday morning last
while journeying with a party of friends
from San Bruno to San Andreas Lake.
Mr. Eagleson is fond of trout-fishing, and
at an early hour on Sunday morning a
start was made from tbe San Bruno House
to the fishing grounds. While on the way
up the steep incline the horses shied at
some object, and the wagon in which were
seated the anglers tipped over on its side.
Mr. Eagleson, anticipating a heavy and
dangerous fall in case he remained on
board, leaped from the conveyance, and
when hi; friends picked him up they found
that his right leg was broken near the
ankle.
Although the injury is severe Mr. Eagle
son is rapidly recovering, and bis physician
is in hopes that he will soon be in a posi
tion to leave his room.
