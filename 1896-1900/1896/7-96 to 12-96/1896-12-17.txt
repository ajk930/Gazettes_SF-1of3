SAY MACEO
STILL LIVES
Cubans Scout the Reports
of the Brave Leader's
Death.
SPAIN HAS OFFERED NO
PROOF.
Neither the General's Eody Nor

Produced.
I NOT DISHEARTENED BY HIS
ABSENCE.
Important Engagements Fought in
Pinar D:l Rio and Matanzas
Provinces.
â  HAVANA, Crm, Dec. 16 (via Key West,
F.la., Dec. 16.).â Maceo's death is still sur
rounded by mystery, The body is un
discovered and no further proofs have
been adduced, except the official state
ment which led the Cubans to believe he
is still alive. In fact, the residents of
I'uerta Brava, in the vicinity of which the
engagement occurred, disbelieve the story
of Maceo's death.
Zertucha continues to give contradic
tory evidence. " He now says the knife
Captured belonged to Gomez's son and
not to Maceo. The Cubans consider it
significant that the objects captured, in
cluding the alleged written statements of
Gomez's son, are not yet shown. It is
also significant that no Cubans have
surrendered since the ' leader's alleged
death, proving either that it will not
â affect the revolution or that Maceo is not
dead.
Many rumors are afloat in connection
with Maceo's death, and all are confusing.
One is that a major at Cabezas, Matanzas,
telegraphed that Maceo passed near the
town with a large force. Many couriers
have been sent to investigate, but have
not returned.
The Cubans disbelieve the story that
Maceo was killed by treachery. They say
Maceo was not easily trapped and would
not accept a flag of truce even from Abu-
Ihe marine authorities are indignant at
Weyler's statement that Maceo crossed
the trocha in a boat, and, it is said, have
cabled to Spain protesting.
The Minister laid the fact before the
Cabinet meeting. The relations of the
nav^l and military authorities are
strained.
It is said frictiou has occurred between
Wejier and Civil Governor Porrune on
account of the former not promoting Chief
of Police La Barrea, who is only a major
of the civil guard.
Reports from the field are more meagei
every day. The Government is repressing
news of all important engagements. It is
said encounters iiave occurred in Pinar
dei Rio and Matanzas, but the details are
withheld.
CAMERON'S RESOLUTION.
lavored by the Senate Committee on For
-
ri'tn Relations.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dae. 16.â The
Eenate Committee on Foreign Relations
this morning reached no conclusion on
the Cuban question, but the discussion
showed that the Cameron resolution fa
voring the recognition of Cuban indepen
dence and offering the friendly offices of
the United States with Spain to bring the
war to a close met with the most favor
and may possibly be reported to the Sen
ate in the future.
â All the members were present except
Senators Lod;;e, Daniel and Gray. The
discussion lasted an hour and a half, and
when the committee adjourned it was to
meet in special s-es ion Friday morning
next. Senators Morgan and Mills advo
cated the vigorous resolutions introduced
by them, but it was apparent that the
committee was not prepared to follow
such radical leaders.
The verbiage in the Cameron resolution
does not appear to be altogether satis
factory, but how best to frame it the com
mittee was unable to-day to decide. Even
this resolution is fraught with grave re
sults, for, as one leading member of the
committee said after the committee ad
journed, tfce mere recognition of the in
dependence of Cuba means a uiploinatic
rupture with Spain, if indeed it does not
lead to more serious consequences.
While a definite conclusion was not
reached, members express the hope that
within a few days the committee will be
able to meet on common ground. The
fact that the committee will meet in
special session Friday instead of letting
the matter go over until the regular meet
ing next Wednesday is accepted as a
favorable sistn by the friends of Cuba.
No outsiders were present.
Ssnator Cameron expects to have this
resojution favorably acted upon by the
committee Friday, and if this is done it
will be called up promptly after the holi
day recess.

VALENCIA, Spaix, Dec 17.â A dis
patch from Palermo says that the former
Cuban filibustering steamer Laurada had
left that port for Gibraltar, where she will
ship a cargo and sail for America.
BALTIMORE, Md., Dec. 17. âJ. h.
Sewaro & Co., the charterers of the steamer
Laurada, are inclined to the belief that
tiie dispatch this morning from Valencia,
stating tbat the Laurada had left Palermo
for Gibraltar, and inferentialiy that she
would not attempt a landing at Valencia
was inspired by the same person who
caused a cablegram to be sent to Seward
& Co. last Friday, stating that the United
Slates Government had notified the Con
sul at Valencia "not to permit tee Lau
rada to enter."
"To the hest of our knowledge and be
lief the Laurada is still at Palermo wait

up the situasion somewhat through my

CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 16.â The Cuban
agitation all . through the United States
has become so acute since the President's
message and the death of - Maceo that
Chairman Cragtn of the local Cuban re
lief committee decided to-day, after a con
ference with his associates, to call a gen
eral meeting of the committee of 100
prominent citizens at the Union League
Club Friday afternoon," to consider "the
local state of affairs and prepare for the
contingency of Congressional action in
favor of the Cubans. Cragih estimates the
number of patriotic young men who have
applied for enlistment in the Cuban army
from tHis city at 500." In the last few days
there has been a large increase. The com
mittee is not receiving any applications,
because the law forbids such enlistments,
but it is well known that there is almost a
daily exodus of men in small bodies, so
that no attention has been attracted.'

LIVES IN EXILE
The Missing Archduke a

-^â â  ; , Â», Â« a v' .' â  Countrymen.
S*en in Company With the Woman
lor Whom He Renounced
a Title.
PORTLAND, Or.. Dec. 16.â The Even
ing Telegram of this city says to-day :
Some dozen years or more ago tne Arch
duke John, a brother of the Emperor of
Austria, who possessed a greater passion
for mingling with the subjects of his im
perial brother than for the strict conven
tionality of court life, voluntarily surren
dered his title, estates and future expecta
tions. This came about by his falling in
love with a beautiful actress at the Hof
Theater, at Vienna, whom he resolved to
make his legitimate wife. When this
reached the ears of Emperor Joseph he
grew furious and forbade the Archduke
again appearing in his presence until he
dismissed the notion of the mesalliance
from his mind.
Originally the European press had it
that tne citizenized scion of imperialism
left his native country as an ordinary
sailor and many other foundationless tales
were printed about him, unlil two years
ago it was announced in the papers of this
country that the Archduke died some
where in South America. But for the sub
joined paragraph in yesterday's Oregonian
the death of the citizen Prince would be
an accepted fact outside of the small cir
cle acquainted with his antecedents:
The Austrian Archduke John, who became a
sea-captain, adopting the- name John Orth,
an<l is supposed to have been shot at sea sev
eral years ago, left 1,000,000 francs on deposit
in a bank in Freiburg and another 1,000,000 In
St. Gall, Switzerland.

Was Recently Seen in Buenos Ayres.
AFTER THE STORM.
timber land operator here, refutes all the
sensational stories hitherto printed about
John Orth in the North American press.
He returned from Buenos Ayres, Argen
tina, a few days ago, and seeing the
Oregonian paragraph, he expressed a de
sire to correct the statement with refer
ence to the Prince's death.
"Being born in Josephstadt, a suburb
of Vienna, where I lived until 22 years of
age," said Mr. Stengle to a Telegram rep
resentative, "I knew the Archduke John
by sight as familiarly as I did most of my
acquaintances. Even when be was yet a
young man hÂ» would walk the streets un
attended and hobnob with respectable
burghers as if birth had not distinctly re
moved him from their social realm.
"One evening in the summer of 1895,
while attending the principal theater in
Buenos Ayres, my attention was involun
tarily directed to a large* '.ogÂ« -ontalning
live ladies, accompanied by ona elderly
gentleman. While intently gazing at the
gentleman curing the entre acts, for no
reason I could at tbe moment explain, his
face grew, more and more familiar to me.
Before the close of the play I felt assured
that he was none other than the oft
reported dead Archduke John of Austria.
My apparent hallucination, however, was
dispelled upon being informed that he was
Signor yon Sterrin, a retired German
capitalist, long a resident of Argentina,
employing his large wealth in the develop
ment of the country.
"The followfng day I saw Signor yon
Slerrin on the street, and despite his ad
vanced years I detected in his walk and
manner John Ortb. That evening I again
came across him in the vestibule of my
hotel in conversation with two other gen
tlemen. On the impulse of the moment 1
uttered the words:
" 'Your Imperial Highness.'
"With a start Signor yon Sterrin whirled
about, biushing a deep red, and a second
thereafter he again was in the thick of the
conversation with his friends."
Mr. Stengle added that he subsequently
had an introduction to the signor, and
belore ha left Bueno3 Ayres for Portland
the signor tacitly admitted to him that he
was John Orth, long dead to tbe outer
world. Mr. Stengle was informed that
one of the live ladies he had seen in the
theater lose was the woman for whom the
Prince renounced all possible chances of
becoming Emperor of Austria.

HORACE DAVIS
FOR THE CABINET
Choice of California's Re
publican Delegation in
Congress.
Each Member Has a Favorite,
but Unity Prevails in the
Caucus.
Fruit-Growers' Interests to Be Repre
sented Before the Ways and
Means Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 16. -The
Republican members of the California
delegation met to-day in the committee
room of Representative Loud to consider
the indorsement of a Californian for ap
pointment in President McKinley's
Cabinet. There were present Senator
Perkins and Representatives Loud,
Johnson, Bowers, Barham and McLach
lan. Senator Perkins was chosen chair
man of the meeting.
It was the unanimous sentiment of the
delegation that all shoulr* unite upon
some one candidate and that harmony
should prevail if California was to receive
this distinction. An informal talk de
veloped the fact that nearly every one of
the gentlemen had some favorite to
suggest. Among the names proposed
were those of Horace Davis of San Fran
cisco, James A. Waymire of Alameda,
ex-Senator Charles N. Felton of San
Francisco, Colonel Harrison Gray Otis,
editor of the Los Angeles Times, M. H.
de Young and others. It is understood
that the latter was only supported by
Grove Johnson.
The caucus was a secret one, held behind
closed doors. Tbe participants declined
to divulge what took plaeeat the meeting,
but it is understood that Senator Perkins
had a kind word to say for nearly all of
tbe distinguished Californiaus and espe
cially of his friend Waymire. Repre
sentative Loud championed the cause of
ex-Senator' Felton, with whom be was
associated in Congress. Representatives
Bowers and McLachlan thought that the
southern section of the State should be
recognized. Mr. Barham supported Judge
DeHaven of Santa Rosa.
After an informal talk around tbe table
only the names of Davis, Felton, Waymire
and De Young were considered. No
formal ballots were taken, according to
one of the members of the delegation, and
it soon became apparent that the senti
ment was about evenly divided between
Horace Davis and Mr. Felton, the result
being that the former received the in
dorsement of the delegation, before which
Mr. Loud withdrew the name of Mr. De
Young, Johnson stating that he would
support De Younjj to the end. Mr. Loud
thereupon said that be had authority from
Mr. De Young to withdraw his name.
One member of the delegation present
at the meeting to-day said to the Call
correspondent that Mr. Davis was selected
as the choice of the delegation because he
was tbe only one of all tbe Californians
mentioned who had achieved a reputation
which would entitle him to a place in the
Cabinet.
AH of tbe members united in eulogy of
Mr. Davis, who had served two terms in
Congress and who has been president of
the State University of California.
Mr. Johnson said: "He is a man who
represents no factions in the party, but
whose appointment would tend to con
ciliate all Republicans of California and
would bring the party together. His
education peculiarly fits him for a Cabinet
position, and while he is not a million
aire be Das worldly goods enough to enter
tain in style."
Mr. Loud said he believed the indorse
ment of Mr. Davis would be very satis
factory to San Francisco and to all Cali
fornia.
Representative Bnrliam approved the
delegation's indorsement and said that it
would be satisfactory to both the people ot
California and himself personally.
Senator Perkins, while especially friend
ly to the aspirations of JuJge Waymire,
conceded that Mr. Davis, the nominee,
was in every way qualified for aov Cabi
net appointment that President McKinley
might tender him.
The Oregon delegation was not invited
to meet with the Californiaus, it being the
understanding that the Oregon men will
urge Representative Hermann for Secre
tary of the Interior.
The delegation also considered the mat
ter of representation before the' Ways and
Means J Committee lin an endeavor to se
cure an increased duty on California prod
ucts, and the following telegram was sent
to the officers of the Fruit-growers' Asso
ciation and others: 'â  > . ;.-.'%'-"f'-y&'f

delegation have.' arranged fora hearing be
fore the Committee ou Ways and Means on

will present any data you may furnish in be
half of California industries affected by this
proposed tariff, and will arrange a hearing for

Gsokge C. Perkins, Chairman.
It is understood that Representative
Barham will appear before the committee
on December 28, 31 and January 6 to ad
vocate an increased duty on wine, lumber
and wool.
Senator Perkins will on December 30
make an argument in favor of levying a
specific duty of \y y cents a pound on
sugar, instead of the present duty of 40
per cent ad valorem, as well as a bounty
on the manufacture of beet sugar.
Mr. Rutherford, manager of the Oak
land jutemills, has been notified to appear
before the Ways and Means Committee on
January 2 to urge an increased tariff duty
on articles of jute manufacture.
BLIZZARD IN NEW YORK.
Severest Snowstorm of the Winter
Reaches a Climax â Anxiety for Yes-
sels That Are Due.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 16.â This city
and vicinity were to-day the center of the
severest snowstorm of the winter. It was
accompanied by winds of great velocity.
The storm started in the Lower Mississippi
Vailey last Monday, switched to the At
lantic Coast over .Florida and passed up
the coast, increasing in severity, until early
to-day it reached a climax.
At 2 o'clock this morning tbe wind had
reached the maximum. It was then blow
ing at the rate of forty-eight miles per
hour. By 8 o'clock, however, the wind
had fallen to thirty-seven miles per hour.
By 9 o'clock nearly five inches of snow had
fallen. The temperature here at 8 o'clock
this morning was 22 degrees. In the next
hour it rose one degree.
The barometer in the Weather Bureau
in this city to-day registered 25.7 inches,
the lowest reported from any of the coast
stations, making this city the center of the
storm.
There are several steamers now due
here from European ports. The list con
tains the names of nine steamers that are
from two io six days overdue, this of
course being attributed to the rough
weather which has prevailed at sea re
cently. At bandy Hook the wind came
from tbe north-northeast, blowing a forty
mile gale with a blinding snowstorm.
Three deaths due directly or indirectly
to the storm have been reported.
COLORADO MININQ DISASTER.
Six Men Lose Their Zivea by a Jilast
and a Cave.
RED CLIFF, Colo., Dec. 16.â A terrible
accident occurred late this afternoon in
the Holy Cross mining district. The ac
cident took place in a tunnel in the Holy
Cross mine. A rich strike was made re
cently in the tunnel, and the company
has been pushing developments of the new
vein. Six men were at work in the tunnel
this afternoon. A heavy blast was put in,
which tore down a great quantity of earth
and stone, under which they were crushed
to death.
Tbe district is situated sixteen miles
from this place. The courier bring in
the news of the disaster could not give the
names of the unfortunate miners. Physi
cians were sent from here. It is doubtful
if any further news will be received to
night.

PURSUIT CF THE MURDERER
. BALKED. ,
Mounted Parties Scouring the Border
Country in Quest of the
Americans.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 16.â The pur
suers of Murderer Dunham are about to
be pursued themselves. If they do not *
act with alertness and celerity they are
likely to be caught by a force of Mexican
rurales and taken ignominiously to En
senada jail. The Mexicans have been
ordered to apprehend the American party,
and they will do so if they can.
Not a word has been received from the
pursuers of Dunham, and no person is
known to have seen them after they
leached Mexican territory. So carefully
were the plans laid by ex-Marshal Gard
and Sheriff Lyndon that no one in San
Diego is positive as to the exact destina
tion of the party, though it is evident
that they are going below the line.
The Mexican officers at Tia Juana and
elsewhere along the border are fully alive
to the situation, and so is Colonel A^us
tin Sangines, Governor of the Northern
District of Lower California. The latter
makes it his business to keep posted on '
everything going on along the border, re
ceiving news by special courier or by
wire. The Mexican ollicers as a general
rule speak and read English. The news
of the invasion of Mexican territory by
the Lyndon-Gard posse wrought them tip
to a fever of excitement. The San Diego
papers containing news of the actions of
the posse and its destination were eagerly
scanned.
They were very wrolh at Marshal Gard's
assertion that he would enter Mexican
territory and locate hjs man, then return
and set the wbeels in motion to secure the
aid of every Mexican officer and rurale on
the peninsula. The Tia Juana people
talked and gesticulated over this inter
view and decided to let Governor Sangines
know its import at the earliest possible
moment. A courier was accordinely dis
patched on a fleet horse, bearing the pa
pers and letters from the comandanteat
Tia Juana.
There is said to have been commotion
in Ensenada when the Governor learned
that an armed force was scouring Mexico
without permission. Colonel Sanginea is a
fighting man himself, having conducted
several important campaigns in Central
Mexico on orders from General Diaz.
Sangines in the Tehuantepec uprising dis
played military qualities and firmness to
a degree that will not be encouraging to
the Americans if they fall into his clutches
in violation of the Jaw.
Colonel Sangines' investigation of tha
matter is said on the best of authority to
have resulted in orders to the co
raandante at Tia Juana to gather a force
of rurales, well armed and mounted, and
to pursue without delay the Lyndon-Gard
posse and apprehend it, by force if neces
sary. As was hinted to-ilay by a Mexican
official connected with the consulate, the
Mexican comandante is instructed to
warn the American invaders to peaceably
retire lrom the country and accompany
them to the boundary line in order to in
sure the carrying out of the order. If,
however, the Americans evince a determi
nation to keep on and refuse to obey the
warning Older, then the comandante is
ordered to arrest and convey them to
Ensenada.
At Tia Juana to-day there was a bustling
and suppressed excitement on the part of
the officers, and men on horseback went
out in all directions, presumably to round
up the small bands of rurales scattered
through the country to concentrate them
at some unknown point.
It was reported that the Mexican posse
was to get away some time to-night and
meet another small posse somewbera in
the hills about Stiji, in the direction sup
posed to have been taken by the Lyndon-
Gard party. The rurales noticed at Tia
Juana to-day were in high feather, dis
playing their arms in full view âcarbines,
sabers, pistols and all. They conversed
excitedly together, but would not reply to
any questions propounded by curious
Americana who happened to be visiting
the town.
Constable Clark, who gave the tip to
Sheriff Lyndon that caused that officer to
come posthaste to San Diego, said to-day
'â¢When Sheriff Lyndon returns from the
desert âthat ii from his tripâand Dun
hum ia still at large I shall ask- Lyndon ii
he wants Dunham. If he wants Dunham
I can take him to a man right here who
has talked with Dunham within a week.
He knows where Dunham is and has
known for three months'. Dunham is in
Lower California, but he is not within 165
miles of where Lyndon and Gard are go
ing." p ,

SENATORS ENGAGE
IN WARM DEBATE
A Spicy Colloquy Over
the Dingley Tariff
Bill.
Allen, Vest, Chandler, Sherman,
Gorman and Teller Take
a Hand.
The Missouri Senator Calls Up Allen's
Resolution ani Precipitates
the Battle.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 16.â A very
interesting and important discussion upon
the resolution of Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
to take up the Dingley bill for considera
tion in the Senate was started to-day by
Vest (D.) of Missouri, and was partici
pated in by Allen, Chandler and Gal
linger (R.) of New Hampshire, Frye and
Hale (R.) of Maine, Aldrich (R.) of Rhode
Island, Sherman (R.) of Ohio, Teller
(S. R.) of Colorado and Gorman (D.) of
Maryland.
In the course of the debate more than
one allusion was made to frauds and cor
rup:ion in the late Presidential election,
and Teller remarked pointedly that he was
not certain that his candidate (Bryan) had
been defeated.
Allen questioned whether any difference
could be pointed out between the political
principles of the Republican party and of
Mr. Cleveland, and said jocularly that the
President and the Republicans would have
to be tagged in order to enable a person to
distinguish one from the other.
The upshot of the debate was a com
plete acquiescence on both sides of the*
chamber in the fact that the Dingley Dill'
could not possibly be passed at the present
session and that the enactment of a new
tariff bill would have to go over to a new
session of Congress, to be convened as
early as possible.
Five bills authorizing officers of the
United States to accept medals from
foreign Governments were reported by
Sherman (R.) of Ohio, who asked unani
mous consent to have them considered
and passed. Objection was made by Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska and the bills were
placed on the calendar.
A bill to extend the time for the build
ing of a bridge across the Missouri
River at Lexington, Mo., was passed.
Mitchell (R.) of Oregon introduced a
bill to amend the law which gives
preference in civil appointments to men
who served in the War of tne Rebellion
by extending its provisions to men who
served in any Indian war. He explained
the purpose of the bill and had it re
ferred.
The pension bill was then taken up, and
Gallinger (R.) of New Hampshire, chair
man of the Committee on Pensions, said
he desired to make some observations
touching tho matter of pension frauds.
He had been very much surprised in
listening to the reading of the President's
message that that high official had not
vet disabused his mind of the idea that
pensioners wer.e men of rascally tenden
cies, and said that ifc his judgment these
continued attacks on pensioners and the
President's continued assertions that the
roll of pensioners was not a "roll of
honor" should cease.
A few brief remarks were made by Haw
ley (R.) of Connecticut, and then the bill
was passed without amendment. The net
sum appropriated for pensions (exclusive
of other expenditures) is $140,000,000.
Ve3t (I). ) of Missouri cnliprt up Allen's
resolution of laÂ«t week for the cbn?i lera
tion of the Dingley bill a:id addressed the
Senate. He characterized that bill as one
of the most extraordinary ever intro
duced into Congress. It was extraordi
nary, not only in its provisions, but in the
manner of its birtb and inception. The
administration, protesting that there wan
no deficit in the treasury, had suggested
the necessity of some legislation looking
to relief from financial embarrassment,
and the House of Representatives had pro
ceeded to the passage of the Dingley bill,
for which there had been no administra
tive demand, but which, on the contrary,
had been pronounced entirely unneces
sary. It had not been asked for by the
wool interest or by the iron interest.
Aldrich (R.) of Rhode Island, to whose
views ftnd statements in regard to the
duty on tin iiate Vest had alluded, de
clared that the rates now existing under
the soÂ«called Wilson-Gorman bill were
more protective on the whole iron and
steel schedule than they had been
under the McKiniey act when passed,
owing to the changes in business which
had since taken place.
Vestreminded Aldrich that that Senator
had insisted on a duty ot 2 2-10 cents a
pound on tin plate- in the McKinley act
and opposed reduction of that rate by 1
cent a pound in the Wilson bilJ, but under
that reduced rate the domestic production
of tin plate had increased enormously and
the price of tin plate had fallen very much.
He had read the other day an interview
at Canton, Ohio, iv which the President
elect bad accounted for the increase! pro
duction and the reduced price by ascribing
it to the use ot natural oil for fuel in In
diana. The fact, was, however, that out
of seventy-seven new tin plate factories in
the United Ststes, there were only five in
Indiana.
The fact?, Vest asserted, could not be
answered except by a surreuder on the
part of the Senator from Rhode Island and
his associates that the enormous duties in
the McKinley act were not necessary to
the domestic manufactures of the United
States.
As to the Dingley bill. Vest declared
that it was clearly impossible of adminis
tration. The "horizontal" bill of 1884 hai
been simplicity itself compared with it.
The Dingley bill re-enacted the McKinley
act, and in order to determine a rate of
duty under it it would be necessary to
consult not only the new bill, but the
Wilson act and the McKinley act and the
market price-.
Vest turned his attention to the wool
question and quoted woolen manufactur
ers as saying toat even with free raw wool
and under the duties in the Wilson act no
importation of foreign woolen goods could
take place. The rates were practically
prohibitory. He also quoted Lawrence,
whom he termed the ''shepherd king of
Ohio," aB saying that the enormou-i duty
imposed on raw wool by the McKinley
act had not benefited tho wool-growers of
t c United States.
Referring to the late election Vest said
that the people had been told that if Mc-
Kinley was elected prosperity would shine
upon the country and confidence would be
restored. Had prosperity come? he asked.
Had confidence been restored? It had not
been restored, and what was the result?
The people were buying neither domestic
nor foreign goods. Did Senators expect
ihat by increasing tariff rates more money
would be put into the pockets of the peo
ple? Did Senators expect that they would
give to the people greater ability to buy
by increasing their taxe*?
Speaking of Secretary Carlisle's estimate
of the amount of money in circulation,
Vest characterized it as "a moss-grown
lie," and he declared that the only relief
which could be given to the countryâ as
much as it might bo derided, or as much
as he might be charged with being a luna
tic and anarchist and repudiator â was giv
ing more money to the ountry. Contin
uing he said emphatically : Â«
No country can be prosperous with au in
creasing population and a decreasing volume
S>t money. You have now got a system which
congests the money of the country. This can
not be smothered uy abuse and ridicule. Tne
man who thinks that this last election has
settled the struggle is unfit to legislate for a
free people. He knows nothing about the
great popular impulses and the heart throbs
which go (hrough the people of this whole
Union. If we are anarchists and lunatics
when we ask that the mints be opened to ireo
coinage of silver then this country is lost, be
cause there were 0,499.000 American freemen
who stamped themselves as lunatics and an
archists at the election in November last
William J. Bryan, this "boyorutor." who has
been caricatured and slandered and ridiculed,
polled 47.1 per cent of the entife vote and
the MeKinley papular majority was barely
600,000 in a poll of over 14,000,000.
If there be in this country over 6,000,000
anarchists and lunatics and enemies of the
country's welfare, Gold help the Republic and
free institutions. We are lost. But it is a vile
slander. The men who voted ior Bryan are
honest and patriotic and law-abiding, and we
do not propose to be.rldiculed out of what we
believe right and just.
We are for equality. We want no monopoly,
no class legislation, no exclusive bounties.
This system of a gold standard is the vilest
monopoly ever maintained in the brain of
mortal man. Ido not care to say more of the
last election tban that in my opinion it
was a parody on popular government and on
free institution. lam curious to know what
will be the result of the investigation pro
posed under the resolution oi the gentleman
from XebrasKa â Allen.
I would iike to understand why in the new
and grow ing State of Texas and others in the
West there has been no increase of population
in tour years, while in the old and finished
and completed States of Ohio, Indiana aud
Illinois there has been an enormous increase,
such as wes never found before in any census
of the United States. lam constrained to be
lieve that the Senator Irom New Hampshire
,'Chandler) was correct when he declared that
the Si. Louis convention was honeycombed
with corruption and that the delegates were
bought and sent there for the sole purpose of
nominating McKinley. This was no* ruero
ebullition of zeal for Mr. Reed, for the Sena
tor from New Hampshire afterward in a de
liberate letter reiterated the charge and de
clared that every word which ho had uttered
in regard to the composition of the St. Louis
convention was true.
The average American citizen when he
hears from such high Republican authority
that the convention which nominated the can
didate ol the Republican party was procured
by money and tha; th 9 delegates were sent
there by the use of money is very apt to con
tinue to inquire how the stream which comes
irom so corrupt a source can be called pure â¢
Aldrich (R.) of Rhode Island contro
verted some of Vest's statements as to the
prosperity of the American woolen man
ufacturers, and declared there never was
a time when that industry was so de
pressed and unsatisfactory. Petitions, ne
said, were coming to the Senate every day
imploring Congress to give relief to that
industry.
At this staee of the discussion the morn
ing hour expired and the unfinished busi
ness â the immigration bill â was laid be
fore the Senate. The tariff ditcussion,
however, having been fairly started by
Vest, was continued and was participated
in byFrye(R.)of Maine, Mills (D.) of
Texas, Vest (D.) of Missouri and Mitchell
(R.) of Oregon.
In the course ot it Vest spoke of the
Dingley bill as being dead and consigned
to the tomo of the Capulets, while to an
allusion as to President Cleveland being
the leader to the Senator from Missouri
(Vest) immediately interposed the correc
tion: "No, sir, no â former leader."
[Laughter.]
Mills created 3 laugh by describing how,
out of his coat, the cloth of which was
manufactured in New England, he had
drawn eeveral long horse hairs whlcn had
been worked in as a substitute for wool,
and the hilarity was increased when
Gear(R.) of lowa suggested that the horse
hairs had been put in by the tailor to stif
fen the collar.
Gear also denied the statements of Sena
tors Vest and Mills, that domestic wool
had gone up in price since wool was |
placed on the free list, and said that wool
which had sold at from 19 to 21 cents a
pound under the McKinley act had been
selling this year at 11 cents a pound.
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire also
took a hand in the discussion. If the
Dingley bill were, as Vest had said, in the
tomb of the Capulets, why, he asked.
should lime be wasted in talking about
it? When Senator Allen's resolution for |
a committee of inquiry should be before j
the Senate, it would be his (Chandler's)
pleasure and duty to define his position in
connection with the proposed investiga
tion as to the use of money in the late
election.
Allen asked Chandler whether it was
the settled purpose on the Republican
side of the chamber to pass the Dingley
bill.
Chandler replied that that would depend
almost entirely on the action of the Sena
tor from Nebraska himself.
Allen repeated his question, and was
asfced by Chandler whether he would vote
against the free-silver amendment to the
Dingley bill, to which Allen responded
that he would not be guilty of such a lack
of intelligence.
Chandler asked A'len if he did not know
that, with the free-silver amendment, it
would be impossible to pass the Dingley
bill.
"No, 1 do not," Allen replied, "as the
Senator from New Hampshire has de
clared himself a bimetallist [laughter] aud
as several other Senators nave declared
themselves bimetallists."
"The Senator knows very well," said
Chandier, "that this Dill cannot pass un
less the Republicans of the Senate are
helped by some oi the Palmer Democrats,
or by some of the Bryan Democrats, or by
some of the Populists."
"I do not thins that the Dingley bill is
dead," Allen remarked. "The assertion
that it was consigned to the tomb of the
Capulets was a mere poetic license on the
part of the Senator from Missouri. "
Alien went on to say that instead of
having an extra session of Congress the
most sensible thing that Congress could do
wa3 to adjourn ana not to convene for two
years, ana let the country have some rest.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio addressed the
Senate briefly but passionately. The de
ficiency in the revenue, he declared, was
almost a crime. It was the lirst duty of
Congress to provide for the ordinary ex
penses of the Government. How to raise
the money to pay these expenses and to
carry on the operations of Government
was a question on which the two parties
were entirely apart â one believing that
duties should be levied on imported
goods, but only for revenue â and the other
believing that the duties should be so
levied as to raise revenue ana to encour
age domestic manufacture?.
The result has been that on account of
this dispute the Government has been for
several years expending more than its re
ceipts. That state of things wa-j a dis
grace tc Congress, and ought to De put a
stop to whenever the opportunity offered.
Sherman called attention *to the fact
that the public debt had been reduced
from 1866 until the beginning of Cleve
land's administration by $1,580,000,000,
and that since then it has been increased
by $265,000,000. That increase, he said,
was not the fault of Cleveland, but was
the fault of the existing tariff law. There
was no doubt about that. Even if the
ra:es in the existing larift law were appar
ently high enough, the difficulty was that
the duties were ad valorem instead of
specific. He (Sherman) would have the
Senate proceed to the consideration of
any tariff law that would increase the rev
enues of the Government â he did not care
whether it was in the shape of import du
ties or internal revenue taxes.
He repeated that it was a shame and a
disgrace that In a time of profound peace
the Government ha i, on account of insuf
ficient revenues, to issue bonds. That was
a reproach to Congress; and the same
thing would ba a reproach to any Govern
ment in Europe.
"Therefore," he continusd, "I do not
care in what form It comes or on whose
motion. I am willine to take up the
Dingley bill. The first thing to be donu is
to provide an increase of revenue, so that '
the incoming administration may not be
compelled to go into debt every year."
Vest remarked that the treasury state
ment this morning showed $126,000,000 in
the treasury over and above the gold re
set ye, ami aÂ«ked Sherman what was to be
done with all that money.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1896.
Sherman made a reply which was not
clearly responsive to the question, and
added that ne was willing to have the
Dingley bill tafcen up and passed, as it
would provide enough revenue tem
porarily. He commented upon the free
eilver amendment put on that bill, and
said that it was a most cowardly evasion
of a great and important duty. That free
silver amendment had been introduced in
order to defeat the Dineley bill. It bad
no place In the bill and no connection
with it. It had been put tÃere to prevent
action in passipg the bill.
Teller (silver R.) of Colorado made
his way into the discussion, and declared
positively that it had been well known
that if every Republican Senator voted
for the Dingley bill it would have still
lacked one of a majority, and that it was
the merest pretense for anybody to say
thÃt he had expected that bill to become
a law. It had not been introduced to be
passed and was not a tit bill to be passed.
The Republican party, he continued, was
about to come in power. He would not
be tempted now to express an opinion as
to bow it had secured that power. Some
other time he probably would do so. It
was coming intxi power with the promise
and pledge to the American people that
the distressed condition of affairs which
had existed for many years would disap
pear with the coming in ot iho Republican
party. If the era of confidence had struck
the country he (Teller) had failed to
observe it. The Republican party had a
duty to do to the American people, and it
wouid not do it by talking about the
Dingley bill unless it said to the country
that that was the bill which it wanted.
He declared emphatically that the Dingley
bill would never become a law, and that
there was not a man on the floor who did
not know it. Why, therefore, he asked,
Bhould the Senate spend time over it?
Chandler remarked with a point of sar
casm tbat Republican Senators had not
begun the discussion, but that it had been
got up by the Senator from Nebraska
(Allen), wno liad tried with the Senator
rrom Colorado to elect Mr. Bryan.
"And I am not sure," Teller broke in.
"that we did not elect him." [Lanebter.j
Teller repeated his assertion that the
Dingley bill had not been introduced to be
passed, and that it was understood that
when it was introduced it could not
be passed. It was introduced for a politi
cal purpose and to gain political ad
vantage.
Hale (R. ) of Maine said that it had
never occurred to him trmt the Dingley
bill was not to be passed in an honest
fashion and for an honest purpose if Re
publican Senators could do it.
Teller asserted that the Dingley bill was
a political measure to distract the atten
tion of the American people from the
financial question.
Gorman (D.) of Maryland agreed with
Teller and said the Dingley bill, even if it
had become a law, would not have im
proved the condition of the treasury and
that it was uujust and unequal. "The
Presidential e'ection," he added, "has
passed. The combinations oi men and in
terests made in that campaign are now
matters of history. Republican Senators
have now the power to pas 3 sucti a mon
strosity as the Dingley bill. You have no
time or inclination to remodel it aud
make it a Republican measure, and it is
trifling with the business interests of the
country to hold out a hope by continuous
debate here that some action shall be
taken on the bill when everybody knows
tbat action is impossible."
Hale expressed the hope that the Senate
and the country would take notice from
the statements made by Senators Gorman
and Teller of the diificuities under which
the Republican party in the Senate
labored. There was no use in lighting for
a bill, the passage of which was clearly
impossible. He agreed with Gorman in
saying that it would be the business of the
Republicans at an early session of Con
gress â and the earlier the better â to take
up the whole subject and secure a protec
tive measure, moderate in its terms, but
sufficient to give revenue to the Govern
ment and to properly protect American in
dustries.
Gonnan â You have succeeded â I will
not say how â In having the responsibility,
but you know that you cannot accomplish
anything substantial at this session of Con
gress. You ought, therefore, to stop tnis
discussion and prevent the upturning of
the business interests of the country.
Platt (R. ) of Connecticutâ The Senator
from Maryland is quite right. We never
had a chance to pass the Dingley bill in
the Senate, and we have less chance now
than ever.
Sherman â 1 am inclined to think that in
view of the statements as to the impossi
bility of passing the Dingley bill we ought
not to waste any more time about it. We
are not disposed to attempt impossibilities.
That was the last word of the important
discussion, and the Senate after a short
executive session adjourned until to-mor
row.
SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
Army Appropriation Bill Raises Many
Joint* of Order.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 16.â 1n the
House to-day Bailey (D.) of Texas asked
immediate consideration of a resolution
providing for an investigation by a sub
committee of the Committee on Naval
Affairs into the alleged defects of the bat
tleship Texas. On objection by Dingley
(R. ) of Maine, the resolution was referred
to the committee without action.
The President's veto of tie bill granting
a pension to Nancy A. Allabacb, which
the Senate passed yesterday over the
President's objections, was read and re
ferred to the Committee on Invalid Pen
sions.
On motion of Hull (R.) of lowa the
House went into committee of the whole,
Hopkins (R.)of Illinois in the chair, to
consider tiie army appropriation bill. Mr.
Hull mode a brief explanation of the pro
visions of the bill. It made an increase
for the pay of the army, that for the cur
rent year having been founJ,about|2oo,ooo
short.
The provision extending from twenty to
thirty days the period in which the pay
master-general may examine paymasters'
accounts recommended by the committee
was stricken out on a point of order that
it was new legislation.
The same point Was made by Little (D.)
of Arkansas against the provision aban
doning and transferring the Hot Springs
army hospital to the Interior Department,
and the point was sustained. In a subse
quent somewhat desultory discussion
Payne (R.) of New York cave the history
of the improvement of Hot Springs, stat
ing that when it came to getting an ap
propriation for assumed Government pur
poses, private parties, benefiting to the
greater extent, the people ol Hot Springs,
ArÂ«., were unequaled the whole country
over.
Hull sought to obtain the object desired
by the provision inserted by the committee
by an amendment declaring that no part
oi the money appropriated by the section
should be appliei to the support of the
Hot Springs Hospital.
Dinglev (R.) of Maine said the proposi
tion involved only the right and power of
the House to restrict and limit expendi
tures, and did not change existing law.
Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania, supporting
the position of Dingley, recalled that the
famous Wilmot proviso wa3 added under
the same conditions as Huli's amendment
to the bill appropriating $2,000,000 to
enable the United States to negotiute a
treaty of peace with Mexico, and received
its name because it was a proviso limiting
the expenditures of the money.
80, too, at the time of the Kansas border
troubles a proviso was added to the army
appropriation bill that no part of the
money therein appropriated should be
expended in enforcing tne laws ot the
boÂ«ms legislature of that State.
Despite these arguments and decisions
quoted by the gentleman Chairman Hop
kins said he must differ from the sup
porters of the amendment and held that
inasmuch as the hospital was authorized
by Jaw and appropriations made lor its
support the amendment proposed a
change of the law and he must rule it out
of order.
From this ruling Hull appealed and the
committeeâ 69 to 50â sustained the chair.

SAYS THE TEXAS
IS ALL RIGHT
Secretary Herbert Praises
the Big Battle-Ship
Officially.
Issues a Statement Declaring
That It Ranks With the
Finest
Like All New War Vessels It Pos
sessed Minor Defects to Be
Remedied.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 16.â The
Navy Department issued an official state
ment this morning to demonstrate that
the battle-sbip Texas, instead of being in
any degree a failure, ranks with the finest
warships in the world and is not surpassed
by any American naval vessel. The occa
sion for this announcement is Secretary
Herbert's approval of a court of inquiry
record, which found- no one responsible
for the unfortunate foundering of the ves
sel recently at the Mew York Navy-yard.
Secretary Herbert's statement is as fol
lows:
In giving out the action of the department
on the findings of the recent court of inquiry
as to the accident which resulted in the sink
ing of tho Texas at tne navy-yard, New York,
I have concluded to depart from my usual
custom and make a general statement about
this ship.
Of course the public knows that the accident
about which this court of inquiry was hold
could not have occurred at sea; that it hap
pened because a part of an injection pipe had
been taken out fur repairs, and that the ship
was promptly raised without having suffered
any material damage.
So many criticisms on this vessel have been
made that the public, or a part of it at least,
may be disposed to regard her as valueless.
Considerable objection was made by some' of
the officers of the department to the building
of a ship on the plans of the Texas, and the
question was before more than one board dur
ing the administration of Secretary Whitney,
and afterward, during the administration of
Secretary Tracy, the plans, having been again
brought in question, were submitted to other
boards and were again and again approved,
and so the construction of the ship proceeded
at the Norfolk Navy-yard until, during this
administration, she was completed and sent
to sea.
The Texas was laid down by Mr. Whitney.
A board of eminent naval officers awarded to
a prominent English designer, Mr. John, the
prize that bad been offered by the department
for the best plans of a battle-snip of given di
mensions. At the time and for months after
ward the Navy Department, through the Bu
reas of Construction and Repair and of Steam
Engineering, was expending considerable
money annually in the procurement of draw
ings, plans, etc., from abroad.* We were avail
ing ourselves of the exj criyuce of foreijti na
tions.
There have been several accidents to the
ship since she was commissioned. Different
parts of her machinery have from time to time
developed defects aud it at one time became
apparent that her bottom needed stiffening.
She was sent to tho navy-yard at Norfolk and
her bottom was stiffened, and her defects have,
it is believed, speaking generally, all beeu
remedied except those relating to her turret
and the system of water-tight compartments,
developed by the recent flooding of the vessel,
as shown by the finding of the court of in
quiry.
The department has given orders that these
deficiencies be completely remedied, which can
and will be done in a lew weeks at the New
York navy-yard and at comparatively small
cost.
it would, of course, be very desirable if all
our ships when first completed could be turned
over to the Government by contractors and by
navy-yards in absolutely perfect condition, but
this has never vet been done either in our own
or any other navy. A modern war vessel is an
aggregation of complicated machinery and no
expert expects a ship to be at its best until it
has been shaken down by a cruise of months
and tried thoroughly in all its parts.
It is believed that we have made fewer than
any nation and certainly loss coedy mistakes
than most otheri in the building of a modern
navy; yet there were two of our ships â the
Texas and the Machiasâ that had to be cut in
two and lengthened. There were three others
âthe Detroit, the Montgomery and the Mar
bleheadâin which it was found essential to
make far more fundamental changes than
have ever been found necessary in the Texas,
and yet the latter ship, probably because the
question of her availability as a navy war ves
sel was mooted from the very inception of the
t-hip, has beeu subject to au unusual amount of
harsh criticism.
It Is sometimes stated that there arc naval
officers who are stealthily and surreptitiously
aiming, through the press, to have the public
condemn a vessel of tne United States navy.
If this were true there would be no condemna
tion too strong and no punishment too severe
for such conduct.
The Texas has been cruising as a part of the
North Atlantic squadron for the past four
months, since her bottom was stiffened at the
Norfolk Navy-yard. Captain Glass, one of the
most efficient and reliable officers of the navy,
who has been in command of her, declares
that she is the stiffest, most easily managed
and entirely seaworthy ship in the navy.
Csptain Kobley D. Evans, commanding the
Indiana, holds the same opinion. He says
that when the fleet on the 12th of October was
on its way to New York, in a hurricaneâ in
the worst sea he had ever encounteredâ the
Texas showed that she was the most seaworthy
ship in the fleet.
LEAVES CANTON FOR CHICAGO.
Major McKinley Takes a Vacation to Get
Time to Think About Material
for His Cabinet
CANTON, Ohio, Dsc. 16. -In order to
join nis wife and in a measure for rest
Major McKinley left Canton at 9:27 this
evening to spend a week in Chicago. The
Pennsylvania Company put a private car
at his disposal. He was accompanied by
Charles G. Dawes of Chicago, Captain H.
O. H.eistand, his acting confidential secre
tary, and by correspondents of the United
Associated Presses and several important
journals. Major McKinley expects to reach
Chicago about 8 o'clock Thursday morning,
and will go at once to the residence of Mr.
and Mrs. Lafayette McWilliams, where
his wife is staying. Mr. McKinley will
probaoly remain in Chicago till next
Wednesday nignt and he may return by
way of Cleveland, stopping for a night
with some of his friends there.
This is the second time since his nomi
nation that Major McKinley has left Can
ton. The other occasion wag his visit to
Cleveland at the time of the centenninl
celebration in that city in July last. Ma
jor McKinley's health is sound, but be
leels the need of some rest and recreation.
His toil for six months has been inces
sant, and, judged by ordinary standards,
excessive.
T.'ie Cabinet will be discussed some in
Chicago. "The Wisconsin situation,"
said Join Hicks of Oshkosh, ex-Minister
to Peru, who was here to see Major Me-
Kinley to-day, "will, of course, be talked
about some while Major McKinley is in
Chicago. Wisconsin is not remote and
some of our people will want to say a
word about Mr. Payne or ex-Governor
Hoard, who are the Cabinet possibilities
in Wisconsin.
"Mr. Payne is the choice of a large num
ber of people who are active in politics
and ex-Governor Hoard is strong with tne
farmers. They would like to see him
made Secretary of Agriculture."
Among the callers at Mr. McKinley's
residence to-day were U. S. Manning,
Albany, N. V. ; R. P. Hay ward of Spring
field. Ohio, and General H. Ricbardson of
Chippewa Falls, Wis.
Major McKinJey is giving all the time
left him by callers to the consideration of
his Cabinet He has not commenced even
to think about his inaugural address and
has no intention of setting to work on it
before February.
DUCKING IN THE MARSHES.
The President and Party Practicing on
Small Game Before Engaging in
a Deer Drive.
GEORGETOWN, S. C, Dec. 16.â The
Government launch Water Lily came up
to Wie city this evening, reaching here
about 8 o'clock, bringing mail and dis
patches from tne Presidential party. The
President is in good health. A deer drive
had been arranged for to-day, but the
woods were so wet from the recent rains
that it was abandoned. The party broke
camp this afternoon and, embarking on
the Water Lily, came from the Santce
through the Mosquito Creek canal to the
lighthouse tender vVistaria, which was
anchored in Winyah Bay, near South
Island. After receiving tne party and
taking on board the baggage and bags of
came the Wistaria steamed over to Muddy
Bay. where she lies to-Qight, about a mile
distant from the Annadale Club lodge
or Friendfield.
President Cleveland and his companions
will go ducking in the marÃhes to-morrow
morning, and if the weather is as cold
and windy as it has been to-day they will
have fine sport.
The President and party will remain at
Friendtield until Saturday, going ducking
each morning, and as an invitation has
been extended them by the Donaldson
Bros, for a deer drive on their lands, it is
probable that they will yet nave the pleas
ure of adding a buok or two to their list
of game.
PUTATIVE NOBLEMEN IN JAIL
Two Clever Confidence Men, After Work-
ing the Large European Cities, Come
to Grief at Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 16.â Two prisoners
who claim to be descendants of foreign
nobility are locked up at police bead
quarters on charges of swindling. They
are Count Henry Klingof Strasburg, Ger
many, and Prince Lorenzo Mabes of
Naples. Italy. Whoever they are the
police say they are clever confidence
men and that they are wanted by the
authorities of many large cities of this
country and Enrope. including London,
Paris, Naples, New Y ork and St. Louis.
They have been living here for some time,
it is said, on the proceeds of their last
swindle.
||They came to America from Strasburg
several months ago aud during the trip
met Camille Boussart and Alice Smith,
who intended to open dressmaking parlors
in Chicago.
After spending some little time in New
York and other Eastern cities, where they
are said to have operated swindling
schemes, they came to Chicago and tobk
up their residence in the same hotel where
their women acquaintances were living.
Recently the noblemen disappeared irom
the hotel, after having secured $2000, it is
alleged, from the dressmakers and with
out having settled their baard bill. Com
plaint was made at police headquarters
and Kling was arrested this afternoon as
he was leaving one of the theaters. He
said that his companion, Mabes, was at
the Eureka Hotel on Adams street, and
the detectives found him in the parlor
entertaining a number of ladies with the
piano. He speaks fluently five languages
and is highly accomplished.

NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 16.â Signor
Pietro Ferranti, formerly a celebrated
operatic singer, died yesterday at noon at
the New York Hospital, where he had
been taken suffering from the effects of an
accident.
Twenty years ago there were few singers
on the operatic and concert stage in this
city better known or more popular than
Signor Ferranti. He had a fine voice,
which he knew how to use to the best ad
vantage, and he was a special favorite at
the fashionable musicales of the season.
Signor Ferranti was knocked down and
run over by a cab at the corner of Twentv
fifth street and Fourth avenue on Decem
ber 4. He was badly injured, several
bones having been broKen,and some of his
friends had him removed to the hospital
on December 5. Everything possible was
done for him, but he continued to grow
worse and several daysapo the physicians

LINCOLN, Nebr., Dec. 16 â The; Supreme
Court to-day rendered an opinion on the
beet-sagar bounty law, which, while not
passing on the constitutionality of the
act, delares the bounty not collectible,
inasmuch as the Legislature made no
specific appropriation for its payment.
This means that the sugar factories at
Norfolk and Grand Island will lose a sum
estimated at $50,000, unless at the coming
session of the Legislature a specific appro
priation is made for their benefit, in
which event the constitutionality of the
law may be questioned.
LABOR LEADERS
STILL IN COUNCIL
Many Matters of Public
Interest Before the
Body.
The Draft of a Bill to Compel
the Arbitration of Dif
ferences.
Resolutions of Sympathy With the
Cubans and in Condemnation of
Cleveland.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec 16.â This
morning's session of the American Fed
eration of Labor opened with a full at
tendance. The committee on labels re
ported favorably on a suggestion of the
ciear-makers that tin or cardboard signs
giving various labels be made and dis
tributed among the unions, the idea be
ing to familiarize the public with the
labels of the different trades, and the re
port was concurred in by the convention.
A controversy between the Canvassers'
Union and the American Agents' Associa
tion was reported from the committee on
grievance, with a resolution expelling the
Canvassers' Union, and directing the sec
retary to notify the Central Labor Council
of Cihcinnati not to receive the per capita
tax from the union. The matter was re
ferred back for further investigation.
Edward E. Clark, secretary of the Rail
way Conductors representin? the five
great brotherhoods, read a bill providing
lor enforced arbitration of differences be
tween railway companies and employes,
which Congress will be asked to enact
into a law. The matter was referred to a
special committee.
Delegate Duffy of Kansas City pre
sented a resolution that a committee be
appointed to investigate the boycott
against the Armour Packing Company.
This was adopted. Special committees
were appointed for the consideration of
the eight-honr labor law and the subject
of immigration. The report of the com
mittee of delegates to the British Labor
Congress at Edinburgh, Scotland, was
read by the secretary, and the convention
then adjourned until the afternoon.
The afternoon session wa- opened by a
talk by Dalegate Samuel Woods of Great
Britain on his impression during bis short
stay in America,* his remarks being of a
highly complimentary nature to America
as a Nation and an expression of the ereat
gratification which ho and bis colleague,
Manlinson of Scotland, feel at finding such
a high order of intelligence in the delibet
ative bodies of labor organizations in Che
United States.
He then read an exhaustive paper on
European labor, the late meeting of the
European Labor Congress at Euinburgh,
Scotland, and ihe progress made in recent
years by the labor organizations of Great
Britain, setting forth what organization
has accomplished for working people and
what it hopes to accomplish in the future.
Mr. Maniinson of Scotland made a brief
address to the convention urging closer
alliance between the labor organizations
of the world.
George E. McNeil of Boston was ap
pointed by the president to respond in be
half of the American Federati >n to the
addresses of Great Britain's delegates and
made an eloquent address.
The following resolutions in regard to
the situation in Cuba were presented by
the chairman of the committee on resolu
tions, with a recommendation that they be
adopted :
Rcaolvcd, That the American Federation of
Labor, in convention assembled, tenders its
heartfelt sympathy to all now struggling
against oppression, and especially to the men
oi Cuba, who for ages have sacrificed and
suffered to secure the right of self-goverement.
Resolved, That the example of the people ot
France in giving recognition and aid to the
fathers iv their struggle to rescue the inde
pendence of the colonies is worthy of imita
tion, and we hereby call upon the President
and Congress to recognize the belligerent
rights of the Cuban revolution.
James O'Donnell rJbt only favored the
adoption of the resolutions, but wanted
another added condemning President
Cleveland for not having already taken
such action as the resolutions recommend
ed, and the suggestion met with the in
dorsement of several of the speakers who
followed.
President Samuel Gompers spoke in a
very fervid manner, urging the unanimous
adoption ol the resolutions, wnich were
finally adopted by a vote of GO to 9.
Friday afternoon was finally set as the
time for holding the annual election of
officers of the federation.
A resolution to petition the Pardon
Board of Pennsylvania for commutation
of the sentence of Alexander Bergman,
who shot Mr. Frick or the Carnegie Iron
Works during the strike Â«t Homestead,
Pa., was introduced by Delegate Weis
mann of New York and unanimously
adopted, after which the convention ad
journed until 9 o'clock to-morrow.

CITRUS PRODUCTS
Wonderful Variety Shown
at the Midwinter
Fair.
What the San Joaquin Farmer
Can Grow Upon H s
Acres.
Visitors Marvel at the Diversified
Resources of the Fertili
Valley.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 16. â To-night,
under a star-lit sky, the people of Fresno
and vicinity poured into the Pavilion.
The Call's Fresno weather prophet made
a good guess yesterday when he said the
atmosphere would be clear to-day. It
required two ticket sellers to accommo
date the visitors and for the first time
since it opened the Sin Joaquin County
Citrus Fair had a bie crowd present. The
musical programme was especially at
tractive and there were vocal selections by
the Apollo Club, a local organization of
fourteen voices. The crowds swarmed
among the exhibits and it was a typical
fair scene.
To-morrow is San Joaquin day. Friday
will be children's day. Saturday will in
all probability be called San Francisco
day. To-morrow there will be a big ex
cursion over the valley road from Stock
ton. The Stockton Commercial Associa
tion will come down in a special car. Tlie
Mill City visitors will be met at tha train,
which arrives at 11:50 a. m., and re
ceive a hearty welcome. The band will be
there and the members of tbe Hundred
Thousand Club and the Chamber of Com
merce will turn out to escort the excur
sionists and the Commercial Association
up town.
There will be some speech-making at
the pavilion in the afternoon, and a recep
tion and probably some speeches in tue
evening. George E. Church will deliver
the address of welcome, and the response
will be made by Presideut P. A. Buell of
the Stockton Commercial Association.
A special admission price has been made
for Friday â children's day â and all the
little Lord Fauntleroys, eons, heirs and
heiresses in Fresno and within ten miles
around are expected to be there in their
best bib and tucker. There is some talk
of placing fireplace-screens over the
oranges, figs and raisins. The lemons and
limes will take care of themselves.
On the late train to-night a committee
of the fair management went to San Fran
cisco to arrange for an excursion from San
Francisco to tne citrus fair. The commit
tee is composed of A. R. Brings, C. H.
Mnrkham, A. Gartenlaub, 0. J. Woodward
and Lewis Gundlefinger. The city of
Fresno contributed liberally to the Mid
winter Fair, and its people believe those of
the metropolis ought to come and see the
fir-t great midwinter citrus fair ever held
in the Stale- Saturday, the last day of
the fair; has not yet been christened with
any particular name, but the committee
would like to call it San Francisco day,
and t robably will.
Ttie sun came out this afternoon and
drove the clouds ?.way. Over drying,
steaming roads and pavements the people
wended their way to the pavilion. The !
management was correspondingly grate
ful for the at least, temporary withdrawal
of Jupiter Pluvius from his depressing '
competition with the citrus fair. The
sunshine changed the roof of thin
shakes into a mantle of beautiful soft
straw tints, while here and there a stream
of sunshine, magniiying with the distance
it traversed, fell with a clearer yellow on
the golden fruit or dotted the floor. The
urchin who tried to peep through a bole
in the roof made a dark shadow upon it
and was quickly chased off to the ground.
. That boy, from his fleeting birdseye view
of the wonders beneath, probably bad an
idea that the San Joaquin Valley raises
everything under the sun except icic.es
and snowballs. After an hour or two of
inspection and study on the inside, .the
average spectator receives about the same
impression as the boy. . . â¢
In the San Joaquin Valley are certainly
raised some of me fruits and vegetables
that grow in every known climate, begin
ning with the snow on the surrounding
mountaintops and ending with the cacti

WILL CAPTAIN STANFORD'S FOOTBALL TEAM.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec. 16.â Steuart W. Cotton of San Francisco was
this evening elected io what is popularly considered the highest individual honor
attainable during a man's college life. He was chosen by his fellow football-piayers to '
captain the Stanford Varsity team next season, succeeding Charles M. Fickert of
TehÃchapi, who has filled the position this season with great credit to himself and
to Stanford. As was first stated in the columns of The Call, Fickert was strongly
urged to be a candidate for re-election, but absolutely refused, partly because he was
opposed to establishing the precedent and partly because Cotton's withdrawal as a
candidate a year ago assured Fickert's election.
Carle of Seattle, the big. aggressive Varsity guard for the past two years and a
classmate of Cotton's, was Cotton's only competitor. The play of both men was of the
highest grnde in all the games, but Cotton had the advantage of having served one year
longeron the team, and proved the favorite when it came to a decision between the
two men, though Carle, too, has hosts of friends.
Cotton vas elected by a majority of those twenty-six players who participated in
one or more of the scheduled games during the season with California, Olympic and
Reliance.
Stanford's new captain is in his junior year and is barely 19 yenrs of age, having
entered the university when just past the necessary age limit of 16. He had played
foo ball at Belmont academy before he came to college, but his development here was
remarkable, and iv his freshman year he secured the position of end rush on the
Varsityâ the youngest man who has ever played on the Stanford eleven.
This year he was the youngest of Stanford's representatives in the Thanksgiving
game and was the star of the day, buckine through California's line no less than
thirty-seven times and failing to gain ground but twice out of the forty-five times ne
was given the ball. In his sophomore year he was transferred to tackle, where he made
a record for himself in the Thanksgiving game of '95 by his clean, hard, steady playinsr.
This year it was generally believed by Stanford students that if the California and Stan
ford varsity teams were nearly equal California might win by getting Ransome past the
line, for Stanford had no good tackier in the iield for fullback. So great was this danger
supposed to be and sp great whs the cor.tiaence in Cotton's tackling and his bucking
ability that it was decided by Fickert and Cross almost at the last minute to transfer
Cotton from tackle to fullback. That this move was a very wise one the Thanksgiving
game fully demonstrated. Cotton's old place in the line was admirably filled by C. A.
Thomas of Los Angeles.
Cotton has an ideal physique for football, standing over G feet in height and weigh
ing in ordinary dress very close to. 200 pounds. He is a member of the Sigma Rho Eta
local fraternity and all the class societies, and has an enviable record as a student, his
major study being history. Last year he was president of his class, which has a mem
bership of about 200 students, and was also captain of his cla*s looibali team.
His loug experience at the game, the valuable coaching he has received from Walter
Camp and Cross, and his wide acquaintance with the players especially and the students
generally, should make him a most effective and popular captain.

The simple statement that 22.1,0 square

these exhibits, amid abundant rloweis,
ioliage and many colored lights, through
which wind many aisles, will give a better
idea. The display of citrus fruits does not
fail io bring out expressions of admiration
from the horniest-handed old rancher to
the impressible lass in her teens. Fresno
is proud of it and there is no reason why
shb should not be.
REFUSE TO PAY ASSESSMENTS.
Suit Brought Against PeaidentÃ in a
Jtrc'amation J>i*:rtct.
FRESNO, Cal. Dec. 10.â Aq important
suit involving the validity of the organiza
tion of reclamation districts is on trial
before Judge Webb in the Superior Court
of this county. It was brought by the
Lower KinÂ«a River rpciamafeion district
against a number of residents of Kings and
Tulare counties, to recover the amounts
assessed against them for reclamation
purposes. The asse>smsnt was levied in
June last, and the defendants have tailed
to pay it. They deny its validity. The
reclamation district was organized six
years mo, and in 1594 one of the pronerty
owners named Phillips contested an assess
ment on his own iccount. Suit was
brought asainst him, but Judge Risley of
this county gave judgment in his favor.

IN URIAH ASYLUM, THOUGH SANE.
Fred Reimers, Recently Committee/, De-
clared by a Friend to Be Men
tally Sound.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 16.â Jacob Si
mon, proprietor ot the Columbia House of
this city, has started upon the mission of
rescuing a friend from the Usiah Insane
Asylum, to which he was committed from
San Francisco, while suffering irom the
after effects of a spree.
The man is Fred ILeimers, who has bee:i
in this city off ani on for four or live
years. He has an estate in Germany
valued at about 34,000 marks, equivalent
in American money to $8500. Not long
ago, while visiting in San Francisco, Rei
mers became intoxicated, and while in
that condition was robbed of a consider
able sum of money. He complained of
his loss to the police, but acted in such an
erratic manner that they locked him upon
a c large of insanity and he wascommited
to the asylum at Ukiaii.
Mr. Simon, at whose hotel Reimers
stayed while here, learned of his friend's
predicament only recently. That Rei
mers is now sane the hotel-keeper has no
doubt, for at various times in the past
Reimers acted as if demented when on a
spree, but recovered his reason as soon as
the effects of (he iiouor disappeared.
Some time aeo lleituers was arrested
here for robbery, but it transpired that he
purloined the watch stolen by him while
iiitoxicaied and demented from the ex
cessive use of liquor. He was rescued by
Sinion, who hopes now to get him out of
the Ukiah institution.

TTIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1896.
MEXICO DEMANDS HIS LIFE.
Causes the Arrest of an American for
Shooting a Murderer Who Re
sisted Arrest.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec 16.â Sam A.
Thing, brother of Deputy Sheriff Frank
Thing of Potrero, on the Mexican line, is
in jail on a charge of murder, and bail has
been refused him. He was arrested on
Monday on tbe instigation of tbe Mexican
Consul here, acting under orders from
Mexico. The complainant is Sacramento
Martinez, a sister of Thing's victim, San
tiago Socias.
On April 16 the Thing brothers went to
Tecate, not far from Potreio, to arrest
Socias, who was* wanted for murder in
Orange County. Socias was a desperate
man, and the Thing brothers armed them
selves, expecting trouble. They found
their man in a blacksmith-shop and
placed him under arrest. They walked
outside, and Frank Thing asked Socias if
he had any arms. The Mexican said he
had none.
When outside Socias stepped back and
said he would not be taken and reached
for his revolver or made a motion as if he
would draw one. Young Thing was be
hind his brother and had a pistol in his
hand. He stepped forward and held it at
Socias' breast and warned him not to
niaice trouble. Socias retreated and kept
tupging at his breeches pocket as if he
expected to find a weapon there. After
another warning young Thing shot, fear
ing that his brother, the Deputy Sheriff,
would be killed. The bullet killed Socias.
No weapon was found upon Socias and
although the Coroner's jury exonerated
young Thing from all blame this incident
seemed 10 be the starting point for an in
vestigation which was instituted by Mexi
can Consul Lomeli o! this city.
The affair was declared to be a premedi
tated murder in revenue for an insult
offered by Socias to Sara Thing some t'me
before, and the District Attorney's office
was declared to have been willfully care
less in not investigating the case further.
The matter was further complicated by
the fact that Socias was a Mexican citizen.
Lomeli investigated the case as far as
possible, and succeeded in bringing it to
the attention of Secretary of Stale Olney.
The correspondence was transmitted io
Governor Budd and the arrest followed.
CAUGB.T IN COLORADO.
San Diego Vfiieern Arrett an Alleged
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 16.â A deputy
sheriff of this county is on his way to this
city with J. W. Strickler, recently of
Vista. S trickier is wanted for a land
swindle which he is alleged to have worked
in this city last May, just before he fled
from the State. A vigorous search has
been made for him, but ne was not lo
cated until ten days ago, when the Sheriff
heard of him in Colorado.
Strickler lived at Vista for some years,
where he conducted a store and was hignly
respected. He became indebted to alnrjro
number of wholesale merchants and com
mission men, and then, on December 4,
1895, he transferred his property in trust
to Simon Levi, representing the Klauber
& Levi Company and many other firms.
This fact Mr. Levi sets forth at length in
a complaint riled in Justice Bryan's court
on September 15 last, the creditors num
bering over thirty firms in this city and
Los Angeles.
The property fraudulently transferred
by Strickler is near Escondido. With
reckless indifference to the rights of others
Strickler, on May 1 last, is alleged to have
sold the same property to a man named
Joseph Kaets and then struck out for Col
orado.
Disappeared at Astoria.
ASTORIA, Or,, Dec. 16.â Captain Da
vies, in command of the British ship Del
cairnie, arrived in port on Monday after
noon from Japan. After leaving the ship's
papers w ith the British Consul he started
out to "take in" the town. He has not
been seen since. There is every reason to
believe that he wandered down to the
dock and fell into the river, as his hat was
found there.

Friends of the People's Site Confi
dent That Hantiogton Will
Be Beaten.
LOS ANGELES,; Cal., Dec. 16.â The
Government Commission, the duty of
which, under the act of Congress creating
it, is to determine which of two sites â that
at San Pedro or that at Santa Monica
shall be chosen for a deep-sea harbor for
Southern California, held Its preliminary
meeting in secret session at the West
minster Hotel to-day. The session began
at 10 a. m. anil lasted until 3p. m. Every
member of the board was present, with
Secretary Pratt In charge of the various
papers and minutes, and Admiral J. G.
Walker, U, S. N.,in the chair. The session
was devoted principally to an examination
of documents, charts and other data bear
ing upon the important subject under
investigation. Soon after the close of tue
meeting this afternoon, Secretary Pratt
formulated tb6 following bulletin lor the
press and public:
The board }or locating a deep-water harbor
in Southern California at Its session to-day de
termined to commence its public bearings on
Monday next, the '21st inst , in the meeting
room of tne Chamber of Commerce. The hear
ing will begin each day at 10 a. m. and close
at 1 r. m.. and will be devoted solely to the con
sideration of matters-bearing upon ihe merits of
the two locations (San Pedro andganta Monica)
as harbors. It is the desire of the board that
the advocates of the two locations shall de
termine between themselves as to which shall
open the argument. The board also decided
that it was inexpedient to accept free trans
portation to the various points wtiicn it may
desire to vioit in connection with itÂ» Investi
gations; all services and facilities affoified the
board will be paid for at reasontbla rates.
The interim between now and next
Monday will be employed by the board in
secret sessions, in visits of inspection to
the two sites and in the examination of
data collected by competent engineers
and marine officers who have in years
past made observations respecting the
character and direction of winter storms
at these places. The commission will as
a whole make a thorough personal exami
nation of San Pedro and Santa Monica,
the United States Geodetic Survey
st amer Gedney to be used for the pur
pose. After all this has been done, the
commission's report to the President will
be formulated. The commission expects
to be in this vicinity for at least six weefis.
Everybody i 3 in a quandary as to the
nature of the fight which Huntington
proposes putting up in opposition to the
splendid and formidable array against
his private harbor scheme. His hench
men and lawyers, usually so attive in
emergencies of this kind, seem to be tak
ing no interest in the matter at issue.
There seems to be no explanation for this
arathy anywnere, hence the general ex
pression of surprise in all quarters.
The personnel of the commission has
made a very favorable impression on the
few business and professional men who
have met its members. They are conceded
to be able, efficient and of high character.
The friends of San Pedro are sanguine as
to the result of the investigation. The
perpetual falsehoods, forged petitions,
packed raeetij es and a weak and vacillat
ing Common Council, which were used
last spring in favor of Santa Monica, can
no longer bo utilized now that the issues
are to be fought out on the ground, where
swift exposure would follow misdeeds and
bring the perpetrators into immediate
disgrace.

Griffith's letter to the Mayor and Council
apprising th m of this princely donation
i 3 in part as follows:
In the course of twenty-three years' active
business life in California I have become
proudly attached to our beautiful city of Los
Angeles, which, through its great natural ad
vantages and its matchless climate, averaging
300 sunny days in the year, Is destined to soon
become a great metropolis. The arduous work
of the3e years has been rewarded with fair suc
cess, and, recognizing the duty which one who
has acquired some little wealth owes to the
community in which he has prospered, and
desiring to aid the advancement and happi
ness of the city that hr.s been for so long and
always will be my home, I am Impelled to
make- an offer, the acceptance of which by
yourselves, acting for the people, I believe will
be a source of enjoyment and pride to my fel
lows and add a charm to our beloved city.
Realizing that public parks are the most de
sirable feature oi alt cities which have them,
and that they lend an attractiveness and
beauty that no other adjunct can, I hereby
propose to present to the city of Los Anpeles,
us a Christmas gift, a public park of about 3000
acres of land in one body, situated a fraction
over a mile north of the northern city line, in
cluding two and a half miles of the frostiess
foothills bordering on the Cahuenga Valley,
five miles of the Los Angeles River bottomâ
the lands generally known as the Ostrich
Farm, and the beautiful little valley which
was called the Press Colony site; also with
these lands the improvements thereon, con
sisting oi several buildings and a water plant,
with tunnels and piping, the original cost of
theso having been over $10,000, ana all of
which will be of service and Deneflt in im
proving the park.
This gift enables Los Angeles to at last
have what was most needed â a magnifi
cent breathing soot, susceptible of the
highest development, the delight of the
people of Los Angeles and the wonder
and Admiration of the people from other
localities.

Irrigation Plans Discussed
hy the Delegates at
Phoenix.
Ex-Chief Justice Kibbey Talks
Against Governmental
Assistance.
Scientific Paprs on the Reclamation
of Arid LanJs Read in the
Congress.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Dec. 16.â Three thou
send visitors are in Phoenix to-day to at
tend the fifth annual session of the Na
tional Irrigation Congress. They came
from twenty-five States, the Eastern men
taking as much interest in irrigation as
the arid-land citizens. Strawberries,
oranges, lemons, grapes and various other
semi-tropical fruits were presented to the
residents of the frozen East.
Great interest was manifested to-day in
the many instructive papers which were
read. J. H. Kibbey, ex-Chief Justice of
Arizona, who while in oftice rendered an
important and far-reaching decision on
the rights of canals, made a brilliant ad
dress, taking strong ground against either
State or National legislation in favor of
aiid lands.
He believed it would be detrimental to
arid regions, as the history of past years
showed that every attempt in this direc
tion had been a failure. This view against
the unanimous sentiment of the congress
has brought forth much adverse criticism.
Ada Irvin, a Phcenix lady, long asso
ciated with land matters, read an excep
tionally interesting paper on the adapta
tion of tbe present land laws for colony
sites. This paper was one of the best
read during the session.
Judge Maxwell of California spoke at
length on why the State and Federal Gov
ernments should construct irrigation
works. His address was able and well re
ceived.
Dr. Chapin of Illinois read a scientific
paper on "Humid America." Dr. Ciapin
is a noted author, and his address was
masterly and interesting. The paper
showed the number of pounds of water
necessary to produce one pound of dry
product. Figures in this respect are sur
prising. For example, the paper declares
one pound of corn requires 369 pounds of
water, either by irrigation or rainfall.
The doctor makes strong claims that the
farms of Illinois, Indiana and Maine
have been greatly improved in productive
ness by the artificial application of water,
and the products have increased fourfold.
The afternoon session was devoted al
most exclusively io the presentation of
papers on the various subjects assigned.
"Climatology," by Captain W. A. Glass
ford of Denver, created much favorable
comment.
Captain Glassford is an attache of the
Weather Bureau and imparted much
valuable information relating to tbe cli
matic conditions of the arid West.
Permanent organization was effected to
day and by-laws and constitution adopted.
One hundred and three new members
were added to the National Association.
The evening session's leading feature
was the presentation programme by the
pupils of the United States Indian School
near Phoenix. The opera - house was
crowded and the delegates expressed
themselves as highly pleased with the
evening's entertainment.
To-morrow closes the session. Friday
and Saturday will be spent in excursions
to various parts of the valley.
FRESNO MURDERER IN LUCK.
Juror* Tail to Atjree Upon Wife- Killer
Jioekwfll's i'ate.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 16.â The jury in
the case of W. W. Rockwell, charged with
the murder of his wife, which has been on
trial before Judge Risley for the past
week, was discharged to-day, being un
able to agree. It had been out for forty
eight hours and innumerable ballots were
taken without changing the vote from the
first. Ten of the jurors were lor murder
in the first degree and two for second de
gree. This was a great surprise, as it was
believed that the disagreement was over
the question of fixing the penalty at hang
ing or life imprisonment. District Attor
ney Snow stated this evening that he
would surely try the case again.

Pretty Ceremony Performed in the
Presence of a Thousand
Guests.
BANTA ROSA, Cal., Dec. 16.â The moat
notable wedding of the year was solem
nized here at high noon to-day, and rep

Isabella Juililard).
ence Isabella .halliard, the beautiful
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Juilliard,
and the groom is Mark L. McDonald Jr.,
eldest son of Colonel and Mrs. McDonald.
The ceremony was performed in the
Presbyterian church by the Rev. William
Martin, in the presence of nearly 1000 in
vited guests. The sacred edifice was beau
tifully decorated from designs furnished
by Mrs. J. N. Wiley, and executed under
her personal supervision. They were
somewhat unique, from the fact that not
a single flower was used, and the artistic
effect of a blending of holly-berries, ferns
and palms was striking and nove!.
When the orpan sounded the strains of
Handel's beautiful briaal music the audi
ence arose to receive the bridal party,
which came slowly up the center aisle.
First came the gentlemen ushers, W. G.
Bouta, Maj- r L. W. Juilliard, N. W. Kit
tle and James R. Edwards. The\ were
folowed by the Dridssmaids, Miss Florence
Rockwell of Boston, Miss Ethel Moore of
Oakland and Miss Mabel McDowney of
Santa Rosa, and then the maid ot honor,
Miss Hallie Porter of this City. The
yount; ladies were attired alike in white
broadcloth suits, trimmed with mink, and
large black-velvet hats with plumes, and
they carried bouquets ot red carnation.
Then came the bride, leaning on her
father's arm, in a Worth gown of ivory
â white satin, with train trimmed with
point applique and orange blossoms, with
veil to matcn.
The party was met at the altar by the
groom and bis best man, Stewart Mc-
Donald, and under a beautiful marriage
bell the nappy couple responded to the
solemn words that joined them for lire.
The ceremony was followed by a wed
ding breakfast at the Juiallird residence
on Santa Rosa avenue, which was, like
the church, exquisitely decorated, and the
afternoon was devoted to a reception.
Mr. and Mrs. McDonald will reside in
this city after a short bridal tour.

Saturday. Coroner Mitchell has continued
the inquest until to-morrow.
The Hertnff Sen Inquiry.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 16.â A ruling
was given in the morning by the Bering
Sea Claims Commissioners on a subject
which has several times been a question
of difference between the counsel for Great
Britain and the United States. This was
as to the proportion of seals secured out of
those shot by hunters. Judge Putnam,
speaking for the commissioners. said that it
had been decided to restrict the evidence
of witnesses on this point to their prac
tical experience. The number of witnesses,
too, must be limited. Six would be
enough, except in case of unforeseen con
tingencies. As an alternative, the com
missioners were cf the opinion, if it were
agreeable to counsel, that any references
in published reports of the Bering Sea case
at Paris covering this matter were open
to either side to put in.
Santa Cruz Ejectn*Â«nt.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., Dec. 16.â F. W
Ely, assignee of John Â£. Cnace, insolvent.
to-day received notice from the F. A. Hihn
Company, owner of the building occupied
ds the Paciric Ocean House, to vacate the
premises by 12 o'clock to-night. The
Hihn Company served a similar notice on
Sheriff Besse while he was in charge and
the Sheriff made preparations to move,
when the notice was withdrawn. The
Hihn Company complains that the
building ha 3 been drawing no rental
since Chace gave it up. This is owing
to the negotiations now in progress
with the Bank of Santa Cruz County for
the use or purchase of the hotel furniture,
on which the bank holds a mortgage.
Secret Wedding at Spokane.
SPOKANE, Wash., Dec. 16.â Dennis
Ryan, thrt prominent millionaire of St.
Paul, was secretly married this morning
at the Main-street Catholic Church to
May Campbell, also of St. Paul. For some
reason every precaution was taken to
keen the marriage a secret, but it leaked
out this evening. Miss Campbell came to
Spokane about four weeks ago, stopping
at the Langham, while Mr. Ryan, who
came at the same time, stopped at the
Spotane. None of his many friends here
knew of the intended marriage.
SPOKANE LOSES A SUIT.
Decision That (oat* the City Three Hun-
dred Thousand li'illarx.
SPOKANE, Wash., Deo. 16.â The State
Supreme Court 10-day handed down a de
cision in the test case of the German Sav
ings Bank of lowa against the City of
Spokane. This action was brought by the
plaintiff because of the city's failure to
create a fund for tiie payment of certain
street-grade warrants. The Supreme
Court holds that the statute of limitations
has run against a portion of these grade
taxes, and the city having Jailed to collect
until after the statute time had elansed,
would of 'course be powerless to collect
them now; hence the city is liable to the
plaintiff for its failure to collect in a
reasonable time. Under this ruling the
city will be compelled to pay nearly
$300,000 of these warrants out of "the gen
eral fund. The decision affects other cities
in this State also. . .

CONGRESSMAN S. C HYDE of Spokane, Now Here on His
Way to the National Capital.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17,1896.
SAYS HIS STATE
IS REPUBLICAN
Congressman Hyde of Spo
kane Will Yield Noth
ing to California.
It WilL Get Into the Column
Again as Soon as Conditions
Are Normal.
The Congressman Deeply Dep'ores the
Attitude of the Government
Tcwird Cub.l.
Congressman S. C. Hyde of the Btate of
Washington was among the arrivals here
yesterday and is at the Lick. He is on
his way to the National capital. an<l is ac
companied by his daughter, Miss Katie
Hyde.
Mr. Hyde is from the Spokane or East
ern Washington District. His home is in
Spokane, and has been for many years,
he being among the first to locate there.
He is an attorney by profession, and was
three times elected Prosecuting Attorney
at Spokane and served six years consecu
tively.
He is an energetic, pushing man and
goes straight for the thing he wants.
"I was very sorry to learn of the death
of General Maceo," he said to a Call rep
resentative; "it is to me a matter almost
of personal affliction. I could scarcely
keep tears back when I heard of it.
Maceo, to my mind, was another Hanni
bal, and like Hannibal's his skin was
black.
"It always seemed to me that these
people down in Cuba ought to hare been
helped by us. I shall always look upon
it as a grave mistake on the part of our
Government in not doing it. Here they
are, almost under the shadow of our flag,
and fighting for freedom with ten times
more cause than we had during the
Revolution, yet we have not helped them
in the slightest.
"I fear for their cause, now that Maceo is
dead, and I am afraid that if the Spanish
win they will treat the people with extra
ordinary cruelty. Everything goes to
show they will do so.
'â¦Senator Morgan and Iâ Morgan in the
Senate and 1 in the House â introduced
concurrent resolutions during the last
Congress re cognizing the Cubans as bel
ligerents. The resolutions passed both
houses and went to the President, but it
seems that according to custom the Presi
dent bad discretionary power to indorse
or not indorse the resolution. At least
this was so claimed, and it finally went by
default. It appears that in order to mak?
it so the legislation would be equiva
lent to a law it should have been by
a joint resolution, instead of concurrent
resolution, and this I understand, will
now be done.
"It is with pleasure that I learn that
meetings in aid of Cuba's cause have been
held at Spokane, Butte and elsewhere
since I left. There is a great deal of sym
pathy up there with Cuba.
"I believe Congress, at its first session
(the Fifty-fourth Congress), failed of its
duty toward the Cubans and the civilized
world. Its efforts were ieeble and iru po
tent and in poor contrast with its brilliant
achievements in establishing nrmly the
Monroe doctrine and preserving the re
public of Venezuela ;rom the rapacity of
thÂ° British Government."
Neither Mr. Hyde nor Mr. Doolittle, the
Congressman from Western Washington,
was re-elected.
"We had too much Populism there,"
said Mr. Hyde. "Ex-Attorney-General
Jones of Spokane succeeds me and James
Hamilton Lewis ot Seattle succeeds Mr.
| Dooiittle. But I can say that the Staie is
, Republican as much as California and
| Oregon are. The State rightfully belongs
; in the Republican column and will take
its place there as soon as conditions re
! sume their normal sway. There have
j been too many factional differences among
| Republicans. We have be.Â»n cursed, too,
i with the present barbarous method of
j electing United States Senators by the
I Legislature.
"At every session of the Legislature since
our admission in 1889 we have had a Sena
torial election on hand, and are booked
for two more at the session this winter
and the one next ensuing. These contests
have been bitter and injurious to the
party and State legislation. In one in
asance there was a failure to elect, and we
were left with but one Senator for two
years. The Legislature has never yet had
a session to devote to legislation free from
this turmoil and disturbance. In my
opinion our experience is a strong object
lesson, calling for the election of Senators
by direct vote of the people."

BRODERICK INQUISITIVE.
Will Ask Delicquent Tax Col
lector Willett About Clerk
Hire.
One Man Charged Fifty-One and a
Half Days' Work Since Novem
b r 20 Last.
Attorney Willett, who is employed by
the Finance Committee of tiie Board of
Supervisors to coliect delinquent taxes,
must do some explaining to Auditor Brod
erick b4fore the bills of bis clerks for get
ting ou^ the lists of delinquents are paid.
When the bills ran ud to $900, when
only $10,000 was to be collected, the Au
ditor began to ask questions, and now
that they have mounted up to an aggre
gate of $1300 the scrutiny is becoming se
vere. This amount is in addition to Wil
lett's commission. Yesterday a bill was
presented that fairly staggered the Au
ditor. It was that of F. L. Culm, who
asked for pay for 51*4 days' worir, per
formed since November 20 last, when his
last warrant was audited. The bill was
dated December 14, and as only 24 days
had elapsed since the City squared ac
counts with Culm the Auditor did not see
how he could have got in b\)/^ day 3.
Culm explained offhand iv response to
questions that he had worked both day
and night, charging doable time. A sim
ple computation showed the Auditor that
even this method of labor would only pro
duce forty-eight days' work and Mr. Culm
was asked to call again.
Now Auditor Broderick is going into the
whole subject of the delinquent tax man's
bills and will call on him to explain. Mr.
Broderick wants to know if the actual coat
was necessarily so great as it has been
made, and why the books are being
worked on in the attorney's office instead
of in the City Hall. This latter is because
the discovery was made receutly that the
men had not been at work in the hall for
a month past.
Another question relates to the necessity
of holding back the payment of rebates
for months after the records necessary for
their payment were all prepared.
Mr. Broderick is of the opinion that the
Finance Committee had no right to hold
back the repayment of the rebates, and
that the main gainers by such a matter
hare been the brokers who are buying up
the claims.
NEARING THE END.
Most of the Productions at tlie Thea
ters Will lie Changed for
Christina* Week.
"The Cotton King" is still drawing excel
lently at the Columbia Theater. Gus Morti
mer is giving a clever interpretation of the
part of Benjamin Tupper, the comic dyer at
the mill, in place of Edward J. Heron, who
was only lent by Manager Morosco for one
week. The rirismer-Davles Company is in the
last days of its eneagement at the Columbia.
The Frawley Company return from Hono
lulu on the Mariposa to-day, and will at once
arrange for the first production by them at
Columbia Theater, on Monday evening next,
of Auprustin Daly's comedy, "The Railroad of
Love."
"'The Police Patrol," with its stirring scenes
and Interesting characters, is drawing large
audiences to the Grand this week. Frank
Hatch, as the colored gem'man looking for
work, creates plenty of laughter and so does
Edward T. Heron as the newsboy (with songs),
aad the serious roles Hie well taken.
The perennial charm of "The Bohemian
Girl" is again asserting itself at the Tivoli this
week, for the familiar airs are repeatedly and
enthusiastically encored. The cast is a aood
one. Miss Katherine Krieg will piÃy Arline
lor the rest of the run. On Saturday the
Christmas spectacle, "Jack and the Bean
stalk," will be produced.
The successful performance of "Alhambra"
has only a few more days to run at the Alca
zar. For Christmas week "The Cricket on the
Hemth" will be produced. Thirty little girls
will take the parts of the fairies in this pretty
domestic drama.
The Orpheum is doing its usual large busi
ness this week. The pantomime so elcverly
acted by the Pholte Company has made quite
a hit. and promises to continue one of the at
tractions through Christmas week.
To-night Palmer Cox's "Brownies" will be
â een at the Baldwin Theater. The flying;
ballet, the troupe of Oriental dancing girls,
the four Richanln, the demon acrobats', New
house and Waffle, the eccentric European
musical duo, and other specialties will ap
pear.
Hade a Theatrical Mechanic.
Miss Julia Blanc, the young lady who plays
Character parts at Moro6co's, had the peculiar
experience of being made a theatrical me
chanic yesterday. At least she was taken into
the Theatrical Mechanics' Association as an
honorary member. The compliment was par
ticularly flattering since, although this lodge
of the association lias the privilege of initiat
ing three honorary members each year, Miss
Blanc was the only one among all the actors
of the city chosen. There were some lively
initiatory exercises, the proverbial "groat" did
his duty and a pretty speech was duly made,
ami there was a jolly little banquet at which
Mss Blanc was the only lady present. Mlfb
Blanc in tne fourth lady to be made a member
of the association. The three others who
share that honor with her are Josephine Gass
roan, Tillie Morrisey and Lydia Yeamaus

The Many Friends of H. G.
Dalliba Say a Last
Sad Farewell.
In Death the Journalist Sleeps
Beside His Dearly Be
loved Wife.
A Touching Funera'. Service, and a
Solemn R quiem Mass at St.
Mary's Cathedral.
As the great bell of St. Mary's Cathedral
tolled a solemn requiem to the departed
spirit of Henry S. Dalliba yesterday morn
ing its tones carried a feeling of sadness
not only to the hearts of the bereaved
relatives but of every journalist of experi
ence in this City.
At 9:30 o'clock the relatives and near
est friends of the deceased were gathered
together at their residence, 1622 Laguna
THE LATE H. S. DALLIBA.
street. The parlor in which the bier was
placed was beautifully decorated with the
floral offerings of those who had been
Dalliba'a companions in life. There were
several handsome wreaths, crosses and
other floral designs, the offering of the
Press Club, A. K. Stevens, Fred Hack, a
son-in-law, Hugh M. Burke, Charles
Hack and C. W. Nevin and wife. The
colfin was simply buried beneath the
fragrant tributes.
"Poor Dall !" This wasthe involuntary
expression of the pioneer's friends as they
took a last look at his calm, placid fea
tures, even in death reflecting the serenity
of an untroubled conscience and the kind
ness of an open-hearted, generous disposi
tion. Strong men, who had been boon
companions of the deceased, gazed upon
his countenance and turned away with a
suspicious moisture In their eyes. He was
loyal to the crait in life, and in death
they sorrowed for him.
Then the remains, followed by a large
concourse of relatives and friends, were
conveyed to St. Mary's Cathedral, on Van
Neqs avenue. The pallbearer* were:
George K. Fitch, ex-proprietor of the Bul
letin; Robert L. C. Barnes, business man
ager of the same paper; A. K. Stevens,
secretary of the Sutter-street Railway;
Gilbert B. Densmore, a Bulletin editorial
writer; Hugh M. Burke of The Call, W.
C. Bunner and E. D. Dement, represent
ing the Press Club, and J. B. Dillon uf the
Bulletin.
At the cathedral a requiem mass was
celebrated by Father Prendergast. The
funeral cortege then proceeded to Holy
Cross Cemetery, where all that was mor
tal of Henry S. Dalliba was laid to rest be
side the remains of his beloved wife, in ac
cordance with the last wish be expressed.
She has been dead a little over six years.
Of Dalliba's journalistic life in this City
it is hardly necessary to speak. Suffice it
to sÂ«Â»y that he was the oldest working
newspaper man on the Pacific Coast. Much
of his work was done in the higher courts
of the law, for as a court reporter he pos
sessed exceptional qualifications. He was
on terms of cordial friendship with most
of the eminent Judges and laywers of tho
City, and such confidence was reposed in
him that secrets of decisions were often
confided to him before they were made
public.
He was the soul of sincerity and frank
ness and generous to a fault. Tne loss of
his wife broke his heart, and bis health
had been declining for years.
Five daughters and a son survive him.
All were present at the funeral but the
son, who is away in the mountains and
couid not receive the news in time to
reach here.

The lecture-room of ttfe Temple was
thronged with a large audience when the

CUNNINGHAM CASE POSTPONED.
Caused by the Illness of Attorney J. >\
!â :. Wilson.
The case of A. A. Cunningham, charged
with embezzlement, which was to have
been tried in Judge Conlan's court yester
day, was postponed, and next Saturday
was set as the day for the court to make
public when the case will proceed.
The reasons for the postponement were
twofold. Judge Conlan stated that AN
tornev J N. E. Wilson, special counsel
or the prosecution, was so ill that he was
unable to be present and that for various
reasons it was impossible for many of the
jurors to be present. He therefore ex
cused those jurors who were Â°Â£ *â ">*â¢-
The Judge further stated that no jury

forth till after the holidays.
A BANNER AND HORNS.
Big Preparations for the Baseball Game
Sunday.
The "Alerts' section" will need more
recruits next Sunday, for the San Fran
cisco Athletic Uub is making a banner
that will put the rooters from Alameda
under the grand stand, and as to aoâ¢3
well you should see those that wall be
blown by the strons;- lunged boys south of
Market street.
This is the game that will show the
strength of San Francisco's best amateur
ball talent. Heretofore all of the Uty
teams playing against the Alerts have
had players that never played together.
This time it will not be so, as this team
will have the benefit of training and play
ing together for a season.
Every one who has seen the Alerts un
derstands why they are so successful.
They have about the same team they
started with in the spring; their team
worlc is fine, both in fielding and batting
as well as in base-running. They have
shown that it will take a much stronger
team than they are to get the most runs,
for the simple reason that their opponents
do not work all the tricks in the game.

TRUTH.
It is sometimes : good for a
man to know the truth about
things. Sometimes it is kinder
! to tell him only . half .the truth
if you wish to save him unnec-
essary pain. But most men
know . the state of their own
health if they will but admit
it to their own consciences.
The sensible man never tries to
fool himself where his life may
be involved. Just think for a
moment. Do you have dizzy
spells ? Do you have a feeling
of bashfulness when you should
be bold ? Do you get cold,
clammy sweats ? , Do you find
it hard to get refreshing and
sound sleep ? Do you feel
gloomy and depressed when
you ought to be bright and
cheerful? Nasty taste in your
mouth ? A dislike for work or
for exerting yourself in any
way? And perhaps a weak
back ? My good man, don't
pass these symptoms by. Ask
yourself these Questions in all
seriousness. . Either one of them
indicates the approach of nerv-
ous exhaustion, and if you are
suffering in other ways it is
ABOUT
time for you to wake-up, or your
condition will get worse and
worse until you will find your-
self and the organs of vitality
paralyzed and useless. Be wise
in your day and generation.
You can be cured now, and
quickly, too, if you will but
try. You have friends that you
may not know of. Go to the
junction of Ellis, Stockton and
Market streets, and there you
will see a big white building.
It is the Hudson Medical Insti-
tute, and there you can learn all
about that wonderful remedio-
treatment "Hudyau." It is
the wonder of this age of mar-
vels. In 30 days it has cured
the most serious cases of blood-
poisoning ; it makes manhood ;
it disperses gloom ; it brings
light and life ; it cures varico-
cele and hydrocele ; it imparts
to the blood life's very essence ;
it has cured thousands and will
restore to you all your powers.
If you can't go to the Institute -
write and ask for some of the
thousands .of testimonials that â¢
have been given by grateful . *
cured people and they will be ,
sent you free by mail at once.
You can be cured, and you will
be cured, if you will but place

A Tribute to the Heroism and

John J. Earrett Tells of the Ancient
Struggles for the Cross and
Efforts for Liberty.
I The Ban Francisco divisions of the
Ancient Order of Hibernians gave a very
enjoyable entertainment in Metropolitan
Temple last evening. The hall was
crowded and the musical and other num
bers en the programme were enthusiasti
cally encored.
On the stage were seated Jerome Deasy,
president of Division 11; F. G. Peterson,
vice-president; E. J. Ilannon, recording
secretary; P. J. Kelleher, financial secre
tary, and Thomas McÃride, treasurer;
also Rev. Father Crowley, . Thomas R.

"â¢Alter an overture of Iri a h airs on the
â  grand organ by Professor R. J. Harrison,
Captain Jerome Deasy^county president
A. 0. H. of America, made a few opening
remarks, in which he gave some interest
ing facts concerning the order in the
United States. In 1893 the membership
was 89,901, , and to-day it is more than
â¢ double that number. The order had paid
out for benefits $345,768, for burying de
ceased numbers $86,025, for burying
deceased wives of members $11,295. There
was $515,216 in the treasury.
William Hynes followed with several
character songs ana a very clever mono
logue, which kept the audience in good
â¢ junior.; Mr. Hynes had a good voice, well
under control, and a keen sense of the
humorous, with a decided talent for in
terpreting it.
Miss Katherine Black sang a soprano
solo and displayed a rich, mellow voice
with a vibrato which rather enhanced it
than otherwise. It was a sentimental
song, and for an encore she sang a pretty
Irish, ballad.
Miss Clara G. Leonard showed good
training: as a pianist in her selections lrora
â¢'Fra Diavolo." Forlan encore she gave
"Come Back to Erin" with ripplins vari
ations. Her selections were very favora
bly received.
As a reader Miss Fanny Black displayed
'marked ability in her description of an
eventful occasion in the aristocratic church
of 'Rastas Brown. The reader was inter
rupted with a round of merriment when
the lines spoke of the pastor, "Dr." Brown,"
and of Brother Sharkey being appointed
as a committee to wait upon the old-fogy
brother who persisted in singing with ttie
hign-!oneri choir. Miss Black read the
pathetic lines with rare feeling and ex
pression.
M. Grennan played a cornet solo very
. acceptably, and thrilled the audience
with "Killarney," "Last Rose of Sum
mer" and other selections.
Mrs. 8. J. Tally gang "The Three Leaves
â¢ of Shamrock", with much feeling.
The chief feature of the entertainment
was an address by John Barrett. Mr.
A Barrett's effort was an able one, and was a
1 deserving tribute to the virtue and
heroism of the sons and daughters of the
Emerald Isle.
â¢ After expatiating upon the religious
history of Ireland, and her devotion to
the church, Mr. Barrett said:
The Irish nfcver lost their nationality. The
nighty Danes landed' on their shore resolved
â¢ thai not a. vestige should survive of all their
past. They struggled 300 years at their fell
design. Kot only did they not succeed, but
they were themselves entirely absorbed and
lived to embrace trie Irish language, Irish cus
toms, Ireland's religion, and became more
Irish than the Irish themselves. When the
Romans conquered- England they framed her
' laws and induced" in her tneir character. The
some took, place in Gaul, in Greece and Italy,
Ireland is the exception. England stole her
Parliament, ar.dvacedwer upon her nation
ality lor centuries, but all la vain, for it still
" survives. - â¢
Prompt and fearless in the service of their
' motherland, Irishmen have been to the front
in every land where a righteous cause needed
a sturdy nr.d steadfast iiieud. â  Countless bat
tlefields of Europe felt their vnlue. France
' and SpHin aim England und Austria. divide
the honors of their greatest triumphs with

4 them took a brave and telling part.

And FooteÃOjr, famed Fontenoy, had been a

Were no: those exiles ready then, fresh, vehement

*. But never did the hosts of heaven, crowding
thick around its battlements, look down with
gladdened souls upon a nobler band, or cheer
' with lusty shouts of joy, more fit companions
of their bliss than the Irishmen and the sons
of -Irishmen who, with Washington and Lin
coln and Grant and Sherman, made and pre
served us a Nation. In our fearful struggle
for independence they rendered effective
service in every engagement.
More than half the Revolutionary soldiers
â¢ were of Irish blood, a fact attested by unques
tioned authority. Not content to take an ordi
nary part they organized many brigades com
posed exclusively of Irishmen.
â¢ In 1701) Franklin wrote from London that
Ireland strongly favored the Colonial cause.
: .In 1775 Congress wrote a letter to the Irish
people full ot gratitude for the distinguisnea
service of her children. General Montgomery,
who fell In glory at Quebec, was born in Ire
land. John Haucock was of Irish ancestors.
â¢ John Kulledge, commander-in-cniel in South
Carolina, was a native .-sou -of .Ireland* and
fourteen signers of the Declaration of Inde
pendence were of Irish blood. Not less dletin
â  euished was their service in the Civil War and
inaeperably united. with the triumph of the
Union are tho names of Shields and Kearney,
Corcoran and Meagher, Moore and -Logan,
Sheridan and Sherman.
. A ration like an individual, treasures that
possession most which it has toiled and suf
fered the greatest to secure. As the favored
child Is always he wnom accident or sickness
most frequently assailed, whose life and
health cost his loving mother years of worry,
cure and toll, so: no object claims a nation

Ireland and her faith have struggled for their

years of excruciating suffering and measure

ANOTHER ICE CARNIVAL.
It "Will Be in Truckee and "Will Be
More Extensive than the
Previous One.
Last Monday C. F. McGlashan president,
T. B. Whitney first vice-president, John
Moody second vice-president, S. McKay
third vice-president, aud W. M. Buck
halter secretary and treasurer, of the
TrucKee Ice Carnival Company, held an
all day session and decided to hold an
other :ce carnival this winter, on a more
extensive scale than the one of last year.
Tho people of Truckee are most enthusi
astic over ihe matter, and have contrib
uted liberally for tue event. They are to
have tbe co-operation of the citizens of
neighboring towns.
It was decided to advertise the event
from January 2 to the 14th, as that is the
season when the grand ice palace which
is to be built wiU be seen at its best. Ar
rangements have been made so as to
notify ticket agents all along the line in
case "of a change of temperature that
would affect the appearance of the struc
ture, so that they* can advise intending
visitors. President McGlashan, who was
in this City yesterday, stated that it was
decided to'make the carnival much more
attractive than that last year, and possi
bly increase the size of the ice king's pal
ace of froited fretwork and icicles.

The trust deed of the San Francisco and
; San Joaquin Valley Railway, which was
recently executed to the Mercantile Trust
Company of New York returned from
New York Tuesday and will be filed for
record to-day in every county of California.
The deed covers all the property of the
Valley railway, including franchises,
j rights of way, etc., and is in ihe nature of
a mortgage on which to issue 16,000,000 in
bonds. With these bonds it is proposed
i to extend the road to Bakersfield and also
| to join its Stockton terminus with Oak
j land and San Francisco. In January all
j tbe bonds will be turned over to the cus

New York, and soon after it is thought
that the first call of $1,000,000 will be made
upon the bonds. The bonds are to run for
forty years at 5 per cent interest.
FURNITURE FIRMS COMBINE.
The California Absorb* the Business of
the Sterling.
A new arrangement ha 3 been made by
the California Furniture Company where
by it will absorb the business of the Ster
ling Furniture Company. Speaking of
the irfatter last night, N. P. Cole of the
California company said :
"The arrangement hardly amounts to a
consolidation, as the Sterling is a gone- up
affair. It is true that a new corporation
will take hold down there soon, but the
matter is of small importance to us.
Their whole business hardly amounts to a
week of that done by us."

liliS SAN FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1896.
TO PROPOSE A
STATUE TO BURNS
Caledonians Will Discuss
the Project This
Evening.
May Be Another Handsome Me
morial to Adorn Golden
Gate Park.
The Cost as Now Variously Estimated
Will Ba Probably B;twsen
$20,000 and $25,000 .
For some yearV there has been a desire
on the part of many Scotch- Americans to
have a Burns monument placed in Golden
Gate Park, to honor the memory of the
poet. Very likely the monument may
become a reality. This evening the Cale
donian Club will have a banquet. .After
the banquet tbe subject of actively en
gaging in tne work preliminary to actually
having the monument will be proposed for
the consideration and active participation
of the club.
There are wealthy men who have agreed
to become contributors to the fund if they
are assured that the committee will be
wis.ly selected. There is a certain sum of
money, said to be something like $400,
whicn may be a nucleus' for the fund.
This is supposed to be in the possession of
tbe St. Andrew's Society, to whom it
was turned over by the Burns Society
some years ago. The Caledonian Club
owns the Scottish Hall property with the
St. Andrew's Club, and derives from this
property some income. There is no work
immediately in view for the Caledonian
Ciub to do that could interfere with un
dert&kins the Burns monument.
D. R. McNeill, chief ranger of the club,
wiil introduce the subject this evening in
the course of his annual address. He will
recommend that tbe proceeds of the an
nual athletic games of the club be devoted
to this wortny and patriotic purpose.
Probably, so Mr. McNeill thinks, $5000
could be raised toward the monument
fund within one year, which would be a
large and satisfactory start. A suitable
monument would probably cost between
$20,000 and $25,000, This is Mr. McNeiil's
idea, and is also the estimate of Mr. Mc-
Laren, Superintendent of Golden Gate
Park. After the opening remarks the
members of the club pres"nt will be re
quested to discuss the subject fully. If
the club favors the project some more
definite action may be taken at the regu
lar meeting in January, when committees
may be appointed.
TUGGED ON THE CLEATS.
The Teams at Sutroville Fulled With
Determinationâ Postponed Till
Sunday.
The attendance at the Sutroville tug-of
war last night was much better than on
any of the preceding nights excepting
Sunday.
The first teams to take their station on
the cleats were Canada and Germany, the
latter beni* favorites. The betting was
not on tbe general result, bat rather on
the length of time it would take to an
nounce the defeat of the Germans. On
this result it was 2 to 1 that Germany
would meet its Waterloo in less than
twelve minutes. But in this the wise ones
were doomed todisappoinment by twenty
eight seconds.
The pull was a spirited one from the
time Referee Freesa fired off his pistol
until he repeated the operation which
declared tbe final result. Except an occa
sional spurt with the recovery of a few lost
cleats Germany kept losing cleat oy cleat
until the bar fell in 12 minutes and 28 sec
onds.
Denmark and Italy were paiwd off next
with but little anxiety for the exchange
of coin ir the â¢ pool booth. The
only bets offered were 10 to 1 on
the result of Denmark's winning and 2 to
1 that Italy would be defeated in five min
utes. In this there was somewnatof a
disappointment, as it required 12 minutes
and SO seconds to dislodge the Italian
team.
Ireland and Norway faced each other
for the third pull with the betting 10 to 4
on the Irish team. It took the Irish 10
minutes and 10 seconds to dislodge the
Norwegians.
The contest between the Americans and
Slavonians was watched with much inter
est, as the sympathy of tbe audience was
with the Americans in all of their con
tests. The bettins on this issue was 10 to
3, with Very few takers. It took tbe
Americans 2 minutes and 45 seconds to
lift the Slavonian anchor off his seat to a
standing position and with him went tbe
entire team.
The last tug was between Sweden and
Portugal, with the betting 10 to 2 in favor
of Sweden with very few takers. The de
feat of the Portuguese was accomplisned
in 8 minutes and 10 seconds.
Manager F. C. Frees decided at tue con
clusion of last night's entertainment to
abandon the night tugs in consequence of
the unsettled condition of the weather.
He proposes to liuve tue entertainments
carried on the four Sunday afternoons
commencing on next Sunday, December
20, at 2:30 p. M.
This agreement has not met with the
approval of all the teams participating in
the tug. They claim tbe time is too long
to keep the winning teams in suspense as
to the final result.
The captains of the several teams, as
also the spectators, complimented Jos C.
Saxton for his mechanical skill in the con
struction of the platform and gange upon
which the clamp was set into the slot.
PREVENT DIPHTHERIA.
State Board of Health Urges Physicians
to Take Precautions Against the
Spread of the Disease.
In the report of the State Board oT
Health for November, just Issued, diph
theria is made the subject of special men
tion. Dr. Lame, the secretary, says:
Diphtheria has prevailed quite extensively
in San Francisco and some parts of Southern
California. There has, in consequence, been
an increased demand for antitoxine, bnt from
information obtained it has been administered
as a curative, but not as an immunizing agent
and preventive. It is really more important
to prevent liitection than to cure any given
case.
Epidemics in cities can be readily stamped
out by the appointment of a few capable medi
cal officers whose duty it shall be to administer
antitoxiue free for other physicians, and to
see that all who have been exposed shall hava
an immunizing dose. Many physicians are
not provided with an antitoxiue synnee, and
foolishly attempt to inject the remedy, with an
ordiuary hypodermic syringe.
Then ugain, too In tie attention is paid to
local quarantine. Children from rooms in
fected with diphtheriaare permitted to mingle
with the well. Kooms that have been occu
pied by dipntheria patients, with alt the arti
cles of any kind used by them, should be dis
infected by iormaldehyde gas. This is very
easily and quickly cone at a slight expense,
with no injury to room or clothing ana with
no objectionable odor.
If some such efficient and energetic course is
not adopted by municipal authorities diph
theria may be expected to linger indefinitely.
The prompt report of all cases, with tne local
ity and rooms where lound, should be rigidly
enforced.
Reports from forty-nine cities, towns,
Tillages and sanitary districts, aggregat
ing a population of 737,180, show a mor
tality of 899â a death rate of 1.20 per 1000
for November, or 14.40 per 1000 per annum.
LIGHTWEIGHT TEAM WON.
Y. M. C. A. Defeats Lowell High
School in a Brilliant Football
â¢ Match.
One of the prettiest, most exciting and
closely watched football of the sea
son was the contest for charity at Central
Park yesterday afternoon, in which the
Y. M. C. A. coast champion lightweight
team was victorious over the boys of the
Lowell High School by a score of 12 to 8.
Though outweighed and in the first half
apparently outclassed, the Y. M. C. A.
team rallied admirably lor the second
half with the Â«core 8 to 0 against it, and in
a series of deceptive and quickly executed
double passes gained repeatedly through
the high school center, through tackles,
and occasionally round the ends with tine
interference and kept this style of play up
until the game ended with the light
weights again victorious, after three years
in which they have never once been
defeated, though always opposed to
superior weight. .
The spectators, composed largely of
hundreds of small boys from the grammar
schools, were .wildly enthusiastic, and
when the tide turned in favor of the red
and gold, and indicated that the contest
would be close, the grand stands became
a turbulent, gesticulating, noisy throng,
reminding one of the continuous &hrill
chirping of a great flock of blackbirds
perched on high.
The features of the game were a 30
-yard run, near the close of the first half,
I by Fullback Hewaon of the Y. M. C. A.
team, that brought the ball close to a
touchdown and made the spectators wild
with expectancy,. though the high : school
team -, succeeded in preventing further
gains; and in the second half a brilliant
40-yard run by Halfback Miller of Y. M.
C. A., who, , protected by excellent inter
ference, carried the ball to within a few
inches of the line, over which It was forced
on tue next play for the touchdown that
seemed to give the light team renewed
energy for a second and winning touch
down. This Miller is a freshman at
Berkeley. J
Following are the summaries:
Pointsâ M. C. A. Lightweights 12, on two

Yesterday. Superintendent Kennedy of
the Olympic Club received a dispatch
from the manager of the Buite City team
that it would leave for San Francisco on
the 20th i of ', this month and expected to
reach this City on the 23d inst.
A few week's ago Leonard Gill, the ex
captain of the Olympic Club, wrote to one
of the members that the team represent
ing Montana this year was composed of
the strongest aggregation of players in the
country, and that it could whip a team se
lected from the best talent in California. :
The Olympic boys thoroughly ? realize
that they will encounter eleven men all of
whom are 'champions * in their /respective

DISCUSSED MANY
BIG IMPROVEMENTS
A Very Lively Meeting of
the Associated
Clubs.
Did Not Recommend Cutting
Through Laurel Hill
Cemetery.
A Proposition to Frams a Bill by
Which Supervisors May Changs
Street Grades.
The San Francisco Association of Im
provement Clubs held a long and inter
esting meeting in B'nat B'rith Hall last
evening, in which many matters of im
portance tor the City were discussed and
acted upon.
George R. Fletcher presided. William
Mitzner of the street committee presented
a lone report dealing with improvements
in public parks, etc. Particular mention
was made of the fact of an open sewer on
Sanchez street, near Army, discharging
upon the street. He had called the atten
tion of the Board of Health to the dancer
of contagious diseases being caused
thereby.
Dr. Lovelace of that board had replied
that tbe matter had been called to
the attention of the Supervisors, for the
Board of Health was powerless to act, as
it cannot compel the grading or sewering
of a street.
Dr. Salsfield wanted to have the associa
tion petition the Supervisors to nave the
street eraded and sewered, bnt finally it
was decided to refer the matter back to
the local club. No action was taken with
reference to putting a sewer system in the
Holly Park and Ocean View District.
Ex-Judge Van Reynegom of the law
and Legislative committee stated that a
bill was in preparation providing for a
law for the change of street grade 3; also
that a bill was being prepared providing
for the lestoration of the veto power to the
Mayor. Upon the former he presented
this resolution:
Resolved, That a law providing a suitable and
effective procedure for changing established
street grades is an imperative necessity, and
that this association urce representatives of
San Francisco in the Legislature to use their
efforts to secure the passage of such law, as
prepared by the committee on law and legisla
tion of this association.
This raised a very liveiy discussion.
Major B. McKennie wanted lo see what
this law was before the association pledged
itself to indorse it. Ex-Supervisor D?n
man, Joseph Scherer, Senator Dwyer and
others argued for and against the resolu
tion, and several pointedly referred to
jokers in innocent-appearing little resolu
tions. T. L. Haggerty, a civil engineer,
arose and slashed lawyers, Supervisors
and scheming contractors with a vigor
that was almost cruel.
Tbe discussion was settled by adopting
the resolution with an amendment that
the prorosed bill be presented to the asso
ciation before it should be presented to
the Legislature.
Mr. Van Reynegom also said that he
and Judge Hunt were preparing a bill for
the Legislature the purpose of which is to
prevent blackmailing land suits.
F. W. McEwen presented a long report
in which he condemned the official map
prepared by the City Surveyor. Figura
tively speaking, he lore the map to pieces
in twenty-five counts, in which i c set
forth that it was faulty or wholly lacking
in township and sectional lines, stret,
railways, general topography, etc. His
report was received. The objections bad
been filed witb the Board of Supervisors
n the afternoon.
Mr. McEwen also presented the annexed
resolution, which was adopted:

that it is proposed to introduce a bill to ihe

We further recommend, if necessary, that
legislative aid be invoked.
A long discussion followed as to the
amount necessary for the hospital and
this was sent back, to tne committee to

where it will be in close proximity to tne
Affiliated and Coopsr'd colleges, thus be

THE EIGHT METHOD.
The legislators-eiect from the southern
counties of tbe State have met at Los
Angeles for the purpose of considering the
needs of that section of the common
wealth, and t)f devising means for the pur
pose of procuring legislation required to
Satisfy them. In order to do this, the
legislators visited the public institutions
of those counties, and posted themselves
thoroughly on their conditions and on the
amounts of appropriations necessary to
sustain and advance them.
As a result of |hÂ« meeting and investi
gation, we are informed by dispatches
from Los Angeles that while at Whittier
on Tuesday the Republican members of the
Assembly from t::at section of tbe State
met and organized for the purpose of pre
senting a united front and co-operating on
matters of interest peculiar to the south
ern sect. on of the State. It ia said that
members from Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside and San Bernardino counties
were present at the meeting.
While the organization effected was con
fined to Remiblicans elected from the
counties named, it cannot be doubted that
members of the Legislature representing
all parties and all counties south of
Tenachapi will act in unison for the pur
pose stated. The southern delegate*
will come to the State Legislature knowing
exactly what they wish, and prepared to
make a well-directed light for it. There is
every prospect therefore that they will
attain success, and that the south will
once more prove itself to be the pre
eminent factor in State lecisiation.
These tactics are not to be condemned.
On the contrary they are deserving of
praise and commendation. It is alto
gether right and proper that men elected
to represent the intere-ts of certain sec
tions of the Stale should meet together to
consider what those interests are and to
devise means of promoting them. Such
actions become pernicious only when they
tend to sectionalism and when tbe repre
sentatives so far fall short Gf Stats patriot
ism as to regard themselves a3 legislators
for a section only. Ther â  is no reason to
believe the Assembiymen-eiect from the
south have made this mistake, and their
organization therefore should not be re
garded in Middle or Northern California
as adverse to the general welfare.
In fact, so far from looking with jealousy
upon the action of the southern legislators
those who have been elected from other
sections of the State sbouid imitate their
example. Every man elected to the State
Legislature should make himself thor
oughly acquainted with the needs of the
S;ate and primarily with those of his own
section. If tins were always done there
would be muMi more intelligent legisla
tion at Sacramento than has been the
custom, buch a system of self-instruction
would enable every member of the Legis
lature to direct his efforts to the best
result and would go far to put an end to
that bungling legisla'ion which has been
so perniciou? in the past.
PROTECTION SENTIMENT.
A striking evidence of the development
of protection sentiment in the Southern
States has been shown at the convention
of lumbermen now assembled in Cincin
nati, in this convention the Southern
States are largely represented, and the
members from that section are as earnest
in a demand for a protective duty on lum
ber as are those of the East.
There are abundant reasons for this
change of sentiment in the South. Until
a few years ago the Southern people re
garded their industries as free from com
-1 etition from foreign countries, and were
therefore almost unanimously in favor of
free trade. Now, however, by the develop
ment of a diversified industry they find
that foreign competition is as injurious to
them as to the Northern State?, and are
rapidly coming to an understanding of the
importance of supporting the great Na
tional protective system of which the
Republican party is the advocate and
champion.
It is estimated that about 1,000,000,000
feet, of coarse Canadian luraoer is pouring
in upon our markets in competition with
the home product, and the ruinous effect
is felt in all the lumber districts of the
Union, South as well as North and West
as well a- East. As a result of this condi
tion of affairs we now see the lumbermen
of all sections of the Union joining in the
demand for a tariff on lumber sufficiently
high to afford protection to the home in
dustry.
Whiletheevil of the Canadian compe
tition has been felt in the South, it has
been even more disastrous on the Pacific
Coast. The facilities of transportation
between British Columbia and California
enable the lumtermen of Canada to gain
admission to our markets with ease, and
the competition is the more unfair to the
lumbermen of Washington, Oregon and
California because of the different condi
tions under whic.i the industry is carried
on in British Columbia and in this coun
try.
As was pointed out to the convention by
Mr. Foster of Tacoma, the Canadian Gov
ernment takes back the land after the
timber is taken off it, and the lumber
dealers have no taxes to pay there. They
also have cheap iabor, and a tariff of $2
a thonsand feet will not affect them in the
market of the Pacific Coast.
It is certainly an encouraging si?ht to
see men from all sections of the Union
uniting together in support of the great
policy of protection. It gives assurance
that when the protective system is once
restored it will remain as a part of the
permanent policy of the Government for
years to come. It will be supported in all
portions of tbe Union, and will no longer
be subject to the disturbances of sectional
issues or party politic*. The protective
sentiment may now be fairly said to b<
thoroughly American, and, like the policy
itself, has been made perfect by being
made universal.
THE IRRIGATION CONGRESS.
The Irrigation Congress at Phoenix,
Ariz., may prove to be the most important
assembly of the kind in our history. The
problem with which it has to deal has
now become one of practical politics and
is pressing for solution. The time for
vague discussion has gone by and Con
gress will soon have to determine whether
it intends to leave the tasfc of irrigation to
the Slates and Territories or will under
take it as a National enterprise.
Governor Franklin of Arizona, in his
address at the opening of the convention,
expressed the prevailing sentiment in the
Western State? on the subject in saying:
"I believe that the Government should
nive aia to the reclamation of arid lands."
To tbat extent it may be fairly assumed
the people are agreed, bnt the main ques
tion still remains to be settled whether
the Government shall give a sum ot
money to the States possessing arid land ,
leaving it to them to disburse it, or
whether the Government itself should
exercise full control over the matter.
It is certain that either the State or the
General Government should undertake the
work of irrigation, for it is not advisable
that the water rights of our vast arid
region should be left to fall into tbe hands
of individuals or corporations. Private
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THUFSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1896.
enterprise has done much for America,
and tiie people have no objection to the
development of such enterprise on general
lines. Nevertheless it will hardly be ex
pedient to the public welfare of the great
arid districts of the country to permit
virtually their entire lands to pass into
the holdings of private or corporate hand-'.
The ;reat West, which contains all the
arid districts of the country, has never
received it 3 fair share of the appropri
ations from tbe General Government. As
Governor Franklin said, "The arid West
has been an orphan at Washington for a
long time." The paternalism of the Gov
eminent has been given mainly to the
East, and it has shown itself but a nig
gnrdly stepfather toward all the wide re
gion west of the Missouri River.
A well-uevised scheme of Government
aid to the arid districts would work 11
revolution in this sectionof the Union. It
would literally realizs the old saying of
"making the desert blossom as the rose."
It would provide a means for furnishing
millions of people wish happy homes, and
would make the We3t a rival to the
East in wealth and ponulation.
There are good reasons for expecting
that the next Congress will deal with this
subject in a manner commensurate with
its* importance. Tne Republican party,
which will control the next Congress and
the administration, is in a special sense
the champion of American industry and
American development. It will regard
with favor every proposal which tends to
advance the welfare of the country, 'and it
cannot be doubted thai the great subject
of irrigation will receive due consider
ation as soon as President-eL ct McKinley
enters upon his term of office. It devolves
upon the convention at Phoenix to sug
gest the means which will produce the
most beneficial results, and if it succeeds
in doing so there can be little doubt that
the next Congress will adopt measures for
carrying tbem out.
TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES.
With the exception of the passage re
ferring to Cuba, no portion of Cleveland's
message to Congress has received more at
tention in the East than that dealing with
the subject 01 trusts and monopolies.
This passage has been warmly commended
and heatedly condemned. In fact tho
whole tenor of the discussion shows how
intense is ths public interest in the sub
ject.
In referring to trusts the President said,
"Their tendency is to crush out individual
independence a:id to hin.ieror prevent the
free use of human faculties and the fall
development of human character." He
urged additional legislation to prevent
their injurious effects. The Secretary of
the Interior, Duvd K. Francis, in his re
port went even further than the President
and said: "If some legislation is not en
acted to check the erow'ug influence of
wealth and circumscribe the power of
tru-ts and monopolies there will be an up
rising of '.he people D3iore the century
closes whicU will endanger our institu
tions."
The New York Sun commenting upon
the report of the Secretary of the interior
says, "This is tbe chatter of a fool." It
characterizes the utterances of the Presi
dent and the Secretary as "sentimental
anarchy and irredeemable flubdub." It
a3=erts that the Secretary "in the first place
is clearly a fool and in the second plac â¢ is
a disciple of Grover Cleveland, the prime
fomentorof social hatred and plutophobia
in the United States."
These assertions of the Sim have not met
with much favor from other leailing papers
of the country. The issue is not a parti
san one and journals of all parties have
b-en prompt to suDport the President in
his recommendation for more effective
legislation on the subject The lowa State
Register strongly urges Federal Grand
Juries in that Bl ate to investigate the meat
trust and asset at every farmer in lowa
knows that this combination fixes the
prices of meat at every station in lowa
where its refrigerator cars ruu. Other
newspapers of equal repute and eminence
point to the injurious operation of the
great trusts and monopolies oi the country,
and the Journal of Chicago in answering
the question, "What have the trueis
done?" says: "They have done the coun
try, they have done the people, they have
done the law, they have done the courts,
they have done everything standing be
tween themselves and their insatiable
greed."
Unquestionably there is much to be
said on each side of the controversy. It
is boyond dispute that the trusts have
proven ot great economic value to the in
dustries of the country. They have en
abled large manulacturing plants to be
carried on during the past years of de
pression which would have failed and
closed their doors to labor if such com
binations had not been possible. They
have lowered the price to the people of
many of the great staple articles of gen
eral need. They have been in accord with
the growing principep c of co-operation, and
their benefits have been felt in many direc
tions. Nevertheless, it is certain they
have injured the business of small dealers
and have been regarded with aversion by
the people. It seems fair to assume that
this aversion has not been wholly unrea-
Bonable, for a widespread popular senti
ment never arises without some sufficient
cause.
It is clear that one of the problems
which the coming Congress will have to
solve is that of dealing with trusts and
combinations tending to monopoly in
such a way as to protect the people frem
corporate greed and rapacity. A wide
spread popular discontent cannot be ig
nored by statesmen. We can hardly ex
pect to see trusts extinguished, since they
are the outcome of tho economic condi
tions of the time; but Congress may rea
sonably provide some regulation which
will prevent them from becoming oppres
sive to the general interests of the coun
try.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The Italian papers are going into extrava
gances over Miss Sibyl Sanderson, who has
burst as a bright particular star upon the Mi
lanese public at the Lyric Theater of Milan.
This is an example of tne way in which she is
being written up: After saying "The
beautiful and statuesque woman who pre
sented herself in the glittering garments of
Esciarmonde was entirely unknown here,"
the paper goes on to say: "Sibyl Sanderson
was chosen for "Esciarmonde" because she re
alized to perfection the character dreamed of
by the composer. To classic beauty, distinc
tion and matchless plastic grace the gracious
artist unites that gift of a high timbre of voice
which gives an illusion of the supernatural.

in Paris he chose her to personify the
heroine, adored by the populace as ft
divinity, the witch of radiant beauty,
who had to live In the marvelous palace far

did she come, the young singer? Who is she?

would one day accomplish in the feelings of
the most blase opera-uoer, she would probably

that Miss Sanderson has never succeeded in

of her compatriots. There is no doubt about
the great swath that she is cuttlcg iv Milan.

The earnisheeing of Miss Ellen Beach Yaw's
box office receipts at tha Baldwin Theater on
Monday by the Musical Courier recalls the
fact that the Courier has blown hot and cold
in a most singular manner with, regard to
Miss Yaw. At one time the Courier's puffs oi
Miss Yaw were not surpassed by those of her
own press agent. It published her picture, her
biography and such startling and hysterical
descrip ions of her vocal powers that people
believed that the Musical Courier had dis
covered the most remarkable singer of this or
any other age. Readers of the Musical Courier
will remember that quite suddenly a change
came o'er the spirit of its dream. Miss Yaw
instead of being a record-breaking vocalist of
superlative taient suddenly became a young
person whose vocal aspirations had to be
severely sat upon. R.-aders of the Courier
were surprised to hear thai her lower notes
were torn from her throat in a guttural man
ner, that her upper notes were thin and child
ish, and that if she persisted In her present
reprehensible metnods of producing her voice
she would soon have no voice to produce. The
garnisheeing of Miss Yaw's box-office receipts
lets in a flood of light on the Courier's dual
attitude. There was a time when Miss Yaw's
agent paid tribute to the Courier, and in those
days she was a nonesuch, then the tribute
stopped and Miss Yaw's praises stopped with
it. Under theso circumstances one can draw
pretty good conclusions as to the reliability of
either the pruise or the censure.
The leaders of claques in the great Euro
pean opera-bouses an not such insignificant
individuals as people in tbis country are wonV
to imagine. Schoentng, the leader of the
cinque in the Imperial Opera-llouse of Vienna,
recently feted his twenty-filth year of servic;
at the theater. His remarkable origina.it>
has caused him to be considered a daring ntid
artistic innovator in his profession, and hi
anniversary was the signal for many tokens
of admiration to shower upon him. It seems
that Schoentng has fixed a new code of ap
plause, which varies according to the artistic
standing of tho singer, and he has established
besides rules for the artistic application of the
"bravo!" According to the opinion of tnis
expert critic it would be very irritating if,
after the vocalist had caressed the ears of his
audience with a pianissimo dying away into
the air, the claque should suddenly trouble
the silence with applause forte. In such cases
Schoentag uses a softly uttered "bravo!'
which seems to escape involuntarily from the
lips of one of his collaborators. A few mo
ments after another collaborator utters a
second "bravo!" a tr.fle more loudly, and
thus, rinforzando al crescendo, the claque suc
ceeds in enticing the whole theater into an
explosion of enthusiasm. This is what may
be called the perfection of the art of applaud
ing.
Massenet's "Manon" has just been played at
Batavia, the capital of Java, with immense
success. The most remarkable part of the
performance was that the, principal role was
confided to a young Javanese singer, who was
born In Baiavitt and who is said to be oi na
tive origin. Her name is Miss Mac th Pinzza,
and she delighted the public as much by her
ravishing voice as by the charm of her acting.
In commenting on this Le Menestrel says:
"Neither the Abbo Provost nor Massenet ever
dreamed of a yellow Manon, whose charm
must be very difterent from vhat of the young
French girl who ended so sadly in the New
World. The Sandersons, Van Zandts and the
rest of the famous Manons certainly never ex
pected that a yellow lady would dispute the
palm with them; and now it seems that the
Javanese diva, encouraged by her first suc
cess, is about to play in 'La Navarraise,' Just
as if she were Mile. Calve. It is to be hoped
that at the exposition of 1900 this marvelous
diva will make tier debut in Paris."
It is galling to reflect that while San Fran
cisco is to havo no grand opera this season
cities lite Tiflis, Cairo, Buenos Ayres, etc., nre
having fine seasons of opera. Even Batavla is
treating itself to a season of French opera. At
Cairo a splendid repertory is annonnced,
which ranges lrom classics, such as Glnck's
"Orpheus," to the newest works of the French
school. At Buenos Ayres it is announced tnat
Tnmagno will go into partnership with the
impresario Ferrari to undertake the manage
ment of the Italian theater in that town, and
that overtures are being made to Melba, for a
supplementary season.
The news has already been published that
the fcpanish Government, to support the ex
penses of carrying on the war in Cuba, has
placed a heavy tax on theaters, but now it
seems that the managers of all the theaters in
Madrid will not hear of being taxed to sup
port Weyler's forces. They have formed them
selves into a non-taxpaylng union, and, be
lieving that deeds will be niore effective than
words, have firmly announced their intention
of closing every theater in the Spanish capi
tal if the tax is not immediately withdrawn.
The marriage recently took pace in Milan
of the young composer, Umberto Giordando,
who wrote "Andrea Chenier," the only new
operagivt-n by the now defunct Maplesoa com
pany. Giordano married Miss Olga Spatz,
daughter of the proprietor oi the Hotel de
Milan. Among the witnesses to the wedding
was Edward Sonzogno, the editor impresario,
who "discovered" Giordano and produced his
first opera. Among the numerous wedding
presents were a rich lan, sent by Verdi to the
young bride, and the order of the Knight of
the Crown of Italy, sent to the groom by the
King.
The German opera season in Amsterdam has
resulted in a complete fiasco, and the pecun
ia y discomfiture of tho impresario was so
lamentable that the funds of ths German
Benevolent Society in Amsterdam were insuffi
cient to send home the unlortunate members
of the chorus and orchestra. Appeals had to
be made to singers in Germany and Austria
bpfore the members of the troupe could till
be sent home.
Lady composers are growing more and more
numerous. The last to be heard from hns
been vi-ry ambitious, and complete success has
crowned her efforts. She is a Belgian, her
name is Mme. de Grandvnl and sue recently
wrote the music to an opera entitled "Mn
zeppa," for which Messrs. Charles Grandmou
gin and G. Hartmunn wrote the libretto.
"Mazeppa" has been produced at the Royal
Theater of Antwerp with bril.iant success.
An important piece of news has been put in
circulation by an Italian newspaper, in the
following terms: "Verdi has expressed a de
sire to learn to ride a wheel." Another paper
adds gravely that tho news merits confirma

out his desire, we shall soon have on the mar

French operatic art has not been much rep
resented fora number of years at the Royal
Opera of Berlin, but an experiment has just
been made in that line, and it has completely
succeeded, for Beriioz's "Benvcnuto Cellini,"
which nas been given a splendid production
at the Berlin Opera, promises to be one of the
chief attractions of the present season.
A singular example of misguided vigilance
is reported from Vienna, where Joseph Gen
noch, inspector of the Carl Theater, and sev
eral of his assistants are in prison, charged
with having willfully and maliciously set flre
to the theater in order to wiu the reward for
vigilance in putting out the conflagration.
Some interesting developments are expected
at the trial.
Anew opera entitled "Ratbold" has just met
with great success at Mayence. The libretto is
is by Felix Dahn and the music by Reinhold

"Annie Louise," a new operetta by Frits

fully at Cassel.
The Fossati Theater at Milan is giving three

Giardina, "La Presi di Valpignatta," by Dall,

A HOUSE 0 CARDS.

In far off, sunny cblltinooJ time,
And laughed to see It swept away
By som.' light breeze tiia: strayed that way
'I hat left 110 trace nor yet ontline Uj {Â»";
Ci whui had been a house so fine.
I built a hon^e of cards one day
When 1 had come to riper years.
Again I saw it swept away - !
By some bleak wind tha blew that way,
This time I -aw it go with tears,

ARROUND THE CORRIDORS
Gathered at the Palace Hotel a day or two
ago was a group of men interested in and dis
cussing gold and silver mining. Most of them
were young men, but among them was an
eld'.-rly man of striking appearance, with a
face something like that of the late James G.
Blame.
He wore a rather heavy gray beard, and his
hair, equally irosted, was thick and hand
some. A broad, soft, black hat set off his fea
tures, and as a whole he looked like one who
had seen and experienced much that was
calculated to stir the blood. â  .
3he man was Miinp Deidesheimer, famous
in the in mils of Pacific Coast mining. Ue nas
been a pathfinaer in mining, for he was one of
the earliest pioneers of Virginia City, and he
put in the first bet of square timbers in the
Conutock that was ever used in any mine.
For this he has received a handsome medal,
which is highly prized by him, and probably
will be kept as a precious heirloom in his
family. .
While Deidesheimer and his companions sat
talking another old pioneer indulged in
reminiscences of this interesting man. Said
he to a Call representative :
"I remember well in the '70' s when Deides
heimer came over here from Virginia City and
was tendered a great banquet at the Occiden
tal. In those days he was a bigger man than
Mnckay, Flood, Fair or others of the bonanzu
kings. He was worth more, at least it was
supposed he was, and everybody leiievid in
him and lionized him. The banquet was be
cause of a report that Deidesheimer nau made
on the Com>tock, in which he stated that
there was $200,000,000 in these mines.
'â¢It was r.giil at the time 01 the great boom
in stocks on Pine sticet and of the consolida
tion of the California and Virginia. Such ex
citement as there was on this occasion I never
expert to see again. Mr. Deidesheimer wu>
due to arrive from Virginia City, but he was
late aud didn't get in till 9 o'clock.
"Tne crowd that Had massed on the outside
was immense. It was packed for four block*
each way. They cheered aud yelied for
Deidesheimer, and nothing would do but he
must make a speech. Finally he complied.
He came out on the balcony in front and
made a talk to them. He was not by practice
a speaker, but he was a mining man nnd able
to ta.ik off some good points to them. Then ho
withdrew to the banqutt-room, where the
most influential of the City were gethered to
do him homage. It was a great event is his
life, su;e.
"But he has had soms bnd luck since then.
He owns lots of miniug properties, but they
aro not the snaps that his property wassup
posed tq be then. He lives at the Occidental,
and has lived there for almost thirty years.
He owns the Blue Gouge mine in El .Dorado
County, and recently sold it on a bond to
Mackay, Colonel Head and others He ha>
also lately sold another mine whfen he owns
in Calaveras County to Boston jarties. They
are the same parties who not long since bought
the Pioneer, in Mariposa County, from the
Fair estate and J. E. Davis.
"Mr. Deidesheimer's prediction that there
weTe $200,000,000 in the Comstock wasconsid
eratly off. They got Â¥00,000,000, but that
was nil. The rest is due. But that assertion
that there was such an enormous sum tnero
did more than any tiling else to demonetize
silver. It scared the East idmost to denth, and
it bus never got rid of the fear of a flood el
silver." . v
Mr. Deidesheimer is now about 65 years oldi \
As his name indicates, he Is a German by
birth.

would have by this time a population of
from 30,000 to 50,000, out as it is there are
not over 1200 people in the town and im
mediate vicinity.
The great drawback to the development
of the mines and consequent growth of
the town is lack of water. Every effort
has been made to find a supply in the
neighborhood, but so far in vain ; every
drop used has to be brought from tue cow
wells at Gar.ock, near the base of Black
Mountain, some twelve miles to the west
on the road lo Mojave, and as may be
readily imagimd it is both poor and dear,
costing for drinking purposes some $2 50
per barrel, ami for otner purposes irom
$1 50 to $2. The wells at Ganock do not
have an over-abundant supply, and any
unusual tieniand perceptibly diminishes
it and up goes the price. The men en
gaged in supplying the Randsburg camps
with water are making more money at the
business than those who are taking out
gold.
The permanent character of the mines
so far developed and the absolute need of
a sufficient supply of water and the certain
return on money invested in an enterprise
looking to filling this need, has attracted
the attention of capitalists both >n San
Francisco and Los An^ele*, and there is
but little question that before many
months roil by Raudsburg will have as
much water as it can consume with ten
times its present population and some to
spare for other places near by.
Two San Francisco men of abundant
means and large experience in mining de
velopment le.t the City on Saturday last
lor Randsburg, where they will meet
others irom Los Angeles, and with expert
engineers the party will go over the
ground between that town and Owens
Lake, some sixty miles to the northwest
in lnyo County, with a view of laying a
pipe fine to supply Randsburg with water
from the lake. T.ie lower parto! the lake,
as is well known, is rather too alkaline lor
ordinary use, but at the upper and near
the mouth of Owens River the water is
sweet, fresh and cool as sprine water.
This is the nearest point from which it is
practicable to pet water for the Rands
burg dis;iict. The head waters of Kern
River are but little more than hali the
distance to Owens Lake, but the interven
ing mountains present d.fticulties winch
are insurmountabla except at enormous
expense, for reiay pumping stations. The
size of the pipe line will be the only limit
to ihe supply, and there are no great en
gineering difficulties to be overcome in
securing it. The necessary preliminary
inspection has already been made of the
several routes to the lake, and the most
practicable about determined upon, sub
ject to the approval of the parties inter
ested financially in the promotion of the
enterprise.
From the head of the lake, where the
intake will be placed, to Randsburg, the
more feasible route is something less than
eighty miles or little more than the dis
tance in a straight Jine. The route will
skirt the eastern side of the lake till just
north of Oiancha, whence it will strike off
in a southeasterly direction and continue
until it crosses the road from Mojave to
Panaminie, just northeast > f the boundary
line between Kern and San Bernar
dino counties, whence it will turn to the
south and run in nearly a straight line to
Rnndsbnre. The only part of the line
where any serious difficulty will be ex
perienced wili be that over the gap be
tween the Argosy and Coso mountains,
though the rise from Oiancha to thi* point
is not unusually great. Once over the
gap the rest of the way will be down hill,
as it were. No ditching will have to be
iione 10 speak of, as it will not be neces
sary to bury the pipe except at wagon
crossings, though considerable trestling
will be necessary at certain places along
the route.
Once a line of the proper size is laid"the
question of its paying well is settled. The j
charge for waier can be made at just what j
figure under the present prices tue owners
choose to fix. The consumption, too, will
not be confined to Randsburu, the line
will be tapped at various points along the
route for Goler Gulch and other camps
and towns that are sure to spring up as
the country north of Randsburg is pros
pected and developed.

A BIG INCORPORATION.
The Ashford Mining: Company
Formed With a Capital of
$200,000.
The Ashford Mining Company has re
cently been "formed with a capital of $200,
-000. The directors are: Thomas Bull of
Santa Clara, W. C. Andrews of San Jose,
H. J. Ashford of Randsburg, L. R. Ash
ford of Randsburg, Harold Ashford of
Randsburg.
The following mines in the Randsburg
caiap have been purchased: The King
Soomon, Hector, Desert Queen, Kootenai
and Masrpie.
Some 690 feet of shaft and drift work has
beeit done on these claims. The King
Solomon at a depth of 150 feet shows a
two-(oot lead of rich ore with well-defined
walls. This lead has been opened on hail
a dozen places, and can be clearly traced
the full length of the claim. In drifting
on this lead through six feet of ore a two
foot vein was found in the foot wall that
will average from $600 to $1000 per ton.
The last clean-up of mixed ore runs $100
I>er ten. Tne extensions of both the Butte
and Kenyon leads have been opened on
this property, these being two of the best
paying claims in the district The Kenyon
has milled ore averaging $700 to the ton,
while the Butte. which employs about
thirty men, i.s having a steady ouiput of
ore running from $50 lo $150 per ton.
In addition to Uiese Oetined leads, the
company's properly is covered with an I
immense number of very rich stringers
that are expected to pay good dividends
from the surface.
Sailors Want Their Wages.
George Pogmore, John Matson, William

DO NOT FAVOR
SANTA MONICA
Coast Sea Captains Condemn
the Proposed Southern
Harbor.
The British Wheat Ship Will
Fly the German
Flag.
Sale of tbe V omanâ A Well-Known
Eureka Ship-Builder Is In
the Cty.
Santa Monica as a harbor is condemned
by five-eighths of the captains who trade
on tbe coast. They assert that no matter
what improvements are made it will
always be dangerous on account of the
undertov,'. No vesse-l that ties up at any
of the wharves would be able to carry a
hawser strong enough to hold her during
a gale, and in consequence every vessel
that is at anchor there puts to sea when
a ?torrn is approaching, so they say.
Yesterday about a dozen captains were
discussing the question on East street.
They argued the question pro and con,
but the sentiments of all were finally
voiced by Captain Swan of the bark Theo
bald, "banta Monica and Callao are
almost identical in regard to their situa
tion," said he. "Callao has been made
into a safe harbor in ordinary weather,
but in a storm no hawser that has ever
been made could bold a ship. The under
tow is enormous, and it takes vessels
where it will.
"Callao is inclosed by breakwaters on
all sides and the narrow entrance is from
the north. As a general rule it may be
safe to lie there, but as a harbor of refuge
it is a good place for captains to keep
away from. In order to make sure that
ship captains make no mistake in regard
to mooring lines the man we would call
chief wharfinger suppli -s every ship with
hawsers and hns a lorce of men at work
whose only duty it is to see that the vessel
is securely fastened and that the lines do
not part.
"Santa Monica is similar to Callao. At
the former place a 15-inch i awser would
snap like a pipeÂ«tem when a gale was
blowing. They can build as many break
waters as they please, but the undertow
will still remain. As a harbor of refuge it
would be worse than useless, and I for one
would never make lor it.
"San Pedro can De made into a seaport,
and at far less expense than Santa Monica.
At San Pedro the undertow can be re
duced to a minimum, and therefore the
dangers of Callao and fcanta Monica would
be obviated."
The British ship California was sold in
England recently for Â£17,900 to R. M.
Stoman & Co. of Hamburg and will in
future fly the German fla . She was well
known in the wheat trade and on her last
trip here $75,000 was offered lor her. The
owners â the WhitÂ«j Siar line â asked
$100,000, so no bargain was made. Then
the California was loaded "on owner's ac
count," and just before she was ready to
saii wheat took a jump.
George W. McNear offered a $15,000
premium for the cargo and a 25s charter
for the ship, but this offer was refused.
When the California reached Liverpool
the grain merchants boycotted her, as
Captain Blair sold under market rates In
spiteot the opposition the cargo sold like
wildfire, and the company cleared $50,000
on the venture. The California was the
last of the sailing fleet owned by the
White Star line.
The British Yeoman, well known in
San Francisco, was sold to James Taylor
of Liverpool for Â£7750 at the same time as
tn- California. The British Yeoman is an
old-timer, while the California is a mod
ern ship and one of the finest of her class.
H. D. Bendixsen, the well-known ship
builder, is down from Eureka. His yards
are cloaed down for the winter and be will
remain in San Francisco until the new
steamer Humboldt has her trial. During
the past season Bendiisen has built and
equipped the Albert Meyer, now at Banta
Rosalia, whence she will no to Honolulu
to load /or fcÂ«a Francisco ; the Meta Nel
son, which went direct lo Melbourne and
will taKe coal from Newcastle to Honolulu
and will bring sugar from there here; the
sciiooner Defender, now on her way to
Gray's Harbor; Ihe s:eam schooner Alli
ance, which had such a successful trial trip
last Tuesday, and the steamer Humboldt,
now being fitted out at the Fulton ]ron
Works. Bendixaen considers the Hum
boldt the best piece of workmanship he
has inrned out in years, and he takes
more interest, if possible, in the comple
tion of the vessel than doeÂ« Max Kali3h,
the popular agent of the steamer.
The British ship Coniosima, now on the
mud flats in Richardson's bay, will have
to be discnarseil with lighters. The
Piper, Aden, Goodall & Oo.'s schooners
have been chartered and the work of tak
ing out tbe cargo will begin to-day. When
the iron, cement and coke have been taken
out the vessel will be put on the Hunter's
Point drydeck for a thorough overhaul
ing. She struck the reef very hard ana it
is thought that over 10,000 rivets will have
to be replaced.
Several vessels tire overdue. The Sala
uen, from Newcastle, Australia, for Hono
lulu, is now long behinrt time and 90 per
cent reinsurance is offered on her. She
sailed from Newcastle on July 13 last, and
the supposition is that s-hc caught fire and
went down. The Marluorougu Hill,
from a Pacific coast port to Tucoma to
load grain for Queenstown, is long over
due and 30 per cent reinsurance is paid on
her.
The following has been issued by the
Branch Hydrographic Office:
Notice is hereby given that the North Spit
Jetty buoy, a black first-class can, No. 1, which

C. VON TIEDEMAN'S
BRIEF EXULTATION
Deputy District Attorney
Piexotto Springs a Lit
tle Surprise.
Some Possibility of Convicting
the Handsome Defend
ant.
Mrs. Spencer's Photograph Is S l.\
Missing, but the Negative
Has Been Found.
Carl yon Tiedeman, charged with per
jury, walked into judge Wallace's court
room yesterday morning the perfect per-
Bonification of a happy man. Yon Tiede
man is really a handsome creature, large
of stature, of magnificent physique,
polisned in manners, blessed with a win
ning smile that illumines a countenance
of unusual intelligence and benignant
appearance, with Hyperian locks, and
withal appareled like a successful man of
the world, with a touch of the oldtime
dandy added. In honor of the occasion
Yon Tiedeman wore his tall silk hat on
the back of his head, slightly tilting to the
right, and in his spotless shirt Iron:
sparkled a solitaire diamond, secured by a
tiny gold chain, at the end of which was
a pin embellished with a pearl "of purest
ray serene."
It was evident that Yon Tiedeman was
expecting a speedy acquittal on the charge
of perjury that was pending against him.
He knew that the photograph of- Mrs.
Sarah Owen Spencnr that he swore was a
picture oi Harriet P. Christy had been lost
and on this account it. appeared to him
that it would be impossible to secure a
verdict of conviction against him.
, Yon Tiedeman may in the trial be able
to establish his innocence, oral least to
defeat the prosecution's effort to convict;
yet, in regard to the important photo
graph, it seems that he was counting oa a
contingency without full knowledge of the
resources of District Attorney Barnes and
his assistant, Peixotto, tor the latter an
nounced to the court that though the pic
ture, which was abstracted or was lost
from the archives of the court, could not
be tound, yet he had been able to find the
original photograph from which the pic
ture was printed, ami that the negative
and a fac-simile print would be offered in
evidence.
Yon Tiedeman's countenance fellwhen
this statement was made, but he quickly
recovered his self-possession, and through
out the day carefully watched the pro
ceedings of the trial.
Mr. Peixotto stated that the prosecution
exoected to prove that when Yon Ticde
man was indicted on a charge of forgery
for signing the name of Harriet P. Christy
to a deed, by which act he obtained a large
sum of money, he made a successful de
fense by committing another felony â
namely perjury.
Yon Tieaeman knew Mrs. Spencer had
been accused of personating another
woman when signing and acknowledging
a conveyance of real estate, and as he also
knew tii.it Mrs. Spencer was out of the
State he secured a photograph of ncr and
swore that it was a picture of the woman
who had imposed on him by calling her
self Mrs. Christy. To this story the jury
gave credence and returned a verdict of
not guilty, evidently believing that Yon
Tiedeman was the victim of a crafty
woman.
Mr.-. Spencer read of the trial in the
newspapers and at once returned from
New York to San Francisco to clear her
name of the stigma which Yon Tiedeman
had tried to cast uoon it. She said she
stood ready to prove that she was not in
California at the date of the acknowledg
ment of the deed purporting to be signed
by Mrs. Christy, and that therefore Yon
Tiedeman had sworn falsely when he
identified her picture as the Jikenessof the
woman 1 who impersonated Mrs. Christy.
An incident which bade fair to be advan
tageous to Yon Tiedeman was the fact
that the picture produced by him at bis
former trial was "simply what is techni
cally known as a proof, that is, it was not
a finished photograph, and the name ol
the artist was not given. It was expected
that tnis would render it impossible to
find the original negative, but by diligent
inquiry it was finally located, and Judge
Wallace ruled that it was just as vaiid, so
far as proof is concerned, as the picture
presented in Judge Belcher's court by Yon
Tiedeman.
With this understanding the trial wa3
commenced, and yesterday's session was
consumed in reading the testimony given
in Judge Belcher's- court when Yon Tiede
man was on trial for forgery.
PITOAIRN ISLAND.
A Gallant Captain Kefuwn to Allow a
Young Man to Desert His Wife.
The bark Eresham Aboey got in last
night from Rangoon, bringing news from
Pitcairn Island, He touched there No
vember 22, obtained vegetables and was
hospitably received. His report continues :
Two young men wished a passage to San
Francisco in my ship, which at first I saw no
harm in complying with. Later I heard Mr.
Christian asking them the reason of their
â wanting to quit the island, where they baa all
they required and were very happy were they
content. 1 ha^ a long talk with the three
principal men concerning them, who told me
the young men had no money and nowhere to
find a permanent home when they arrived in
tbe States themselves, adrisiup me not to take
them awny. I theu learned that one of the
ladies on board was the wife of one of the
young men. J asked her if she wished her
husband to leave her. In answer I got a de
cided "no," which decided me not to take
them. After remaining rive hours off the
island I tilled the mainyard, bidding adieu
and receiving a godspeed from a most inter
esting people. As they left the ship we were
saluted with three cheers ior tbe Evesham
Abb-y, to wh;ch we responded. We then
made all sail, havinp on board a substantial
prooi of the hospitali'.y of the inhabitants of
Pitcairn Island.

COMMENCES
AT 9 O'CLOCK SHARP. ICOLORED LIGHTS
ON MARKET STREET
A Plan to Illuminate That
Thoroughfare With
Electricity.
It Comprises White Lights on
the Side and Colors in
the Middle.
Merchants Have Talked It Over and
Many Are Enthusiastic for Im
pressive Illuminations.
J. Richard Freud, the attorney and sec
retary of the Merchants' Association, says
there is a movement now on foot to make
Market street gleam at night as no other
of th&w.orld's great thoroughfares appear
after Sol hides his head in the west.
The idea is rather an original one, but it
has, already received the nucleus of strong
support from men directly interested in
the welfare of Market street. And Mr.
Freud says that it has assumed pretty
definite shape. The main thoroughfare of
&an Francisco cannot be in second place,
iv3W that nearly all the other main arteries
a the City have appeared in a blaze of
lir.Uiant electric light It has a feather in
ii.< cap and wants to eclipse the side shows,
sd to speak. For in addition to strings of
eiectric lamps like beads of brilliants on
each side, Market street wants to have a
row-of colored arc light 3 along the center.
Rtfd, yellow and blue, for instance â a very
carnival of color to enhance the stately
avenue of San Francisco in its nightly
garb.
"Market street will be in all probability
the next street to have electric lights. "
Mr. Freud said yesterday. "Some mer
chants on the street have talked the matter
over and are favorably impressed with
the proposition to light Market street.
We will take it up, and I have no doubt
but that merchants on the street will be
only too willing to subscribe as merchants
on the otht- r streets have done. It is to
their interest, of course, and with rows of
arc lights on both sides of Market street
and colored lights at intervals along the
center it would create a striking impres
sion.
"The idea is to illuminate the street
efficiently, and then to have colored lights
in addition to the white ones."
Two gangs of workmen were busy yes
tÂ«rday finishing the strings of electric
lamps on Kearny street toward its north
ern end and on Stockton street, near
Washington square, and those streets were
ablaze in the principal parts last night.
So far the Merchants' Association has
received subscriptions from the following
toward the lighting of Sixteenth street:

MIDWEEK CYCLING NOTES.
Aylwarcl's Big Racing Aggregation.
The Fresno Meet Saturday.
R P. Aylward, the well-known trainer
of Ziegler, Foster, Wells and other cycling
cracks, was recently commissioned by E.
C. SUarns & Co. to organize a racing team
ior them, and has jusi announced his
selection of the following professionals:
Allan N. Jones, Olympic Club Wheelmen ;â¢
H. Downine and Roma E. Dow, San Jose;
and D. E. Whitman of Los Angeles. The
team will appear for the first time at the
Fresno meet next Saturday. Jones will
be the star and Trainer Aylward thinks he
can make a champion out of him. He cer
tainly has the right kind of material in
Jones, and there are no better than Ayl
ward as developer of speed and endurance
in a rider. _.
It seems that Dixon and Kraft got the
world's two, three, four and five mile tan
dem records at the Velodrome on De
cembers, though they were only credited
with the five. The times were 4:212-5,
6:38 4-5. 8:55 and 11:094-5, respectively.
Kraft was to ride a five-mile exhibition on
Christmas day, but the program me is so
crowded that the trial has been postponed
until the following meet.
Wilbur F. Knapp is in Los Angeles visit
ine the trade.
the Garden City Cyclers will bold a
jtrainstrel show next Monday night.
Ji "Bunt" Smith is going for 'Anderson s
J:O3 locomotive paced mile record shortly.
A large number of local riders and fol
lovers of cycle racing will attend the
Fresno meet next Saturday. The South
ern Pacific has made a round triD rate of
$7 90, sleeper $1 50 per berth each way
additional. The Valley road has made a
round trip rate of $5 40 or $3 75 for the one
way, as against the Southern Pacific rate
$o 40. This includes the trip by river boat
to Stockton, but as no boat comes down
from Stockton Sunday night it is imprac
ticable for many who want to be back here
Monday morning to go vhat way.
The following are the entries and handi
caps for the professional races to be run at
Fresno next Saturday :

THEY SWAM THE SLOUGH
How the Keepers of Suisun
Marshes Treat Poach
ing Hunters.
Supervisors of Solano County May
Close the Season for Duck
Shooting.
As stated in Saturday's Call, Jud.ge
Buckles of Solano County issued injunc
tions last Wednesday, at the request of
the president of the Cordelia Gun Club,
to prevent hunters from tre?passing on
the Cordelia Teal Club preserve, which is
In the Suisun marshes in the vicinity of
Teal station.
On Saturday and Sunday deputy con
stables of Solano county awaited the
arrival of the duck-shooters from this
city and Vallejo and served them with
official papers as they embarked irom the
eastbound trains that stopped at Teal
station and the drawbridge.
Some of the hunters who were served
refrained from shooting, but a majority
of them paid little attention to the
notices and ihot over the ponds which
were specially reserved for members of
the Teal and Cordelia gun clubs.
On Saturday night a little "shanty"
wnich was erected by the Teal Club at the
mouth of the FranK rioran Slough took
fire and burned to the ground. This is the
second time that the keeper's hut went
up in smoke. Last year the "station
house" on the marsh was destroyed by
tire and the Teal Club offered a reward of
$500 for information that would lead to the
arrest and conviction of the persons who
applied the torch.
In last Saturday night's conflagration
several rounds of cartridges exploded and
the reports aroused those on board the
Mallard Club and Crystal Palace arks,
whicli are anchored in Cordelia Slough
and within close proximity of the keeper's
"shack."
When the flames from the burning tim
bers illuminated the marsh for miles
around thousands of wild ducks which
were feeding, in the grain-fed ponds, at
tracted by the sudden light, flew toward
it, and for fully twenty minutes the birjs
circled round the blazing shanty, quack
ing and whistling until the pyrotechnical
display was over.
Hunters who were on board the Crystal
Palace ark state that on Sunday some of
the sportsmen who were shooting over
the marshes had to walk several miles
and swim some of the deep sloughs on
their return home.
It appears that when they had finished
shooting â that was, after the morning
flight of birds had ceased â they discov
ered, much to their chagrin, that their
hunting- boats had disappeared and with
them went their coats, ammunition and
such paraphernalia as duck-shooters gen
erally use.
Seeing that their only hope of reaching,
the ark whence they came was by
either swimming and wading the sloughs i
or walking a distance of some twenty
miles by taking a circuitous route, they
decided upon the former scheme and after
several hours of hard exercise they
finally arrived at the ark in a most dilapi
dated condition. The hunters accuse the
Teal Club keepers of stealing their prop
erty and contend that a few weeks ago
they discovered one of their boats which
was missing tied up in the yard of the
Teni Club.
The members of the Mallard Club have
finally declared war against the preserve
ciubÂ«. They say that if they are not per
mitted to shoot on the marsh they will
have the Supervisors close the season.
LECTURED TO STUDENTS.
One of the Experts in the Fair Case
Addresses Heald'Â« Business
College.
Professor D. T. Ames of New York gave
quite an interesting lecture yesterday
afternoon to the students of Heald's Busi
ness College.
Mr. Ames has been in this City for the
past tew weeks in the interest of the heirs
of the Fair estate examining the Craven
deeds, which he claims to be forgeries.
The subjoct the professor discussed be
fore the puDils of tae college was the "Per
sonality in Scientific Investigation of
Handwriting," which he treated at some
length in nil interesting and instructive
manner.
"The characteristics and personalities
of an individual," said Mr. Ames, ''are
identified in his handwriting, and the
st} le of a person's writing is regulated
almost entirely by his occupation in life."
In bearing out this assertion the expert
went on to show on a blackboard the dif
ference in the style of writing of persons
of various professions and lines of busi
ness. Mr. Ames cited many interesting
instances of how he had succeeded in de
tecting the forgeries of many documents
in cases whore be had rendered the serv
ices of an expert in handwriting, as well
as explaining the reasons for the utter im
possibility of the handwriting of any per
son to be duplicated by another.

CLARENCE EDDY, the Great Organist, Who Narrowly Escaped
the Wreck.
he said part of the trip had been rough.
One of his experiences was graphic and
dangerous. He had a narrow escape from
being wrecked. He missed it only by a
few minutes. Said he:
"There was a frightful wreck of a Mid
land train between Newcastle and Grand
Junction. Colorado, on Monday night
The Midland uses the Denver and Rio
Grande track for some miles at this point,
and the Midland train was just ahead of
the Rio Graude train, on which I took
passage.
"A huge bowlder had rolled down from
the side of the mountain and torn one of
the rails completely away. The engineer
did not see that the rail was gone, because
of the snow that had fallen, so the whole
train was thrown completely over. It
took fire and in a little while was entirely
destroyed. There was not a thing left ex
cept some iron.
"The passengers in the train were badly
joggled up and some considerably hurt,
but none, so far as was known, seriously.
The train consisted of the sleeper, passen
ger-car, baggage-car and locomotive. My
train only mbsed the same fate by being
ten minutes late. Probably there would
have been a number of deaths. As it was,
the fact that there were no fatalities was
phenomenal. It was an exceedingly nar
row escape for me and the others of our
train.
"After playing in three masses here on
Christmas day, as I now anticipate, I will
return East again. Meantime I wil: go to
Riverside and Los Angeles, where 1 will
give concerts. The organ at St. Ignatius
Church is certainly one of the largest aud
grandest in the world.
"I have been in Europe for a year and a
half till lately, and I expect to leave for
London and PÂ«ns again in May. I gave
many concerts in different pans of Europe
while abroad this time, and met with
greater success even than I could have
hoped." ________________
IN MEMORIAM.
Women's Press Association and the
Pioneer Kindergarten Eulogize Mrs.
Cooper and Her Daughter.
At a meeting held yesterday the com
mittee on resolutions of the Pacific Coast
Women's Press Association presented the
following, which were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, Our revered and loved charter
member and honored co-worker, Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper, has passed from a life of uuselflsh and
unswerving devotion to duty, to the home
ana to the reward of the falthiul; therefore,
Resolved, That in the marvelous life of our
departed bister we see the love of a faithful
mother and iriend, tender sympathy for the
suffering and fidelity to truth, joined to ear
nestness of purpose and consecration of her
best powers to the interests of humanityâ a
life exemplifying the highest type of Christian
character.
The right, she was its friend; the wrong,
she deplored it; the feeble, she was their
strength; the yvune and friendless, she was
their helper and inspiration.
In a Nation of seventy millions of people no
name could be more honored than hers, while
flags at half mast and tolling bells speak the
praise of her which fills every heart and trem
bles on every lip.
Resolved, That in the lives of the 18,000 chil
dren whom she has led through kindergarten
schools to pathu of mental culture and moral
development, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper will still
live, a blessing to them, to her native land,
aud to the world.
Resolved, That, in Mrs. Cooper, the Pacific
Coast Women* Press Association had a con

THE BROWNIE MAN
OPENS HIS HEART
Palmer Cox Tells How He
Found the Merry Little
People.
Great Demand of Publishers for
Brownie Stories and
Sketches.
The Author Dwelt in San Francisco
From 1862 to 1875 an d Served
in the National Guard.
Palmer Cox, artist and writer who has
gained world-wide celebrity as the creator
of the "Brownies," is delighted to be in
California. He lived in San Francisco from
1862 to 1875, and had as many happy days
and joyful nights as any other mortal of
his class. He belongs yet to the California
Chapter of Masons, and Mission Lodge is
still his Masonic shrine. Through all the
years of his travel and toil be has pre
served his standing and membership in
that lodge.
Palmer Cox was also a member of the
National Guard of California, when in that
eider day to be a guardsman was greater
than to be a king. When Cox carried a
musket in the ranks of C Company, First
Infantry, Colonel W. H. L. Barnes rode at
the head of the regiment, and Georee W.
Granniss was lieutenant-colonel.
The precious jewel in Palmer Cox's lit
erary crown is his record as a contributor
to the Golden Era. Among bis brother
writers were Bret Harte and Charles War
ren Stoddard. Joe Lawrence, editor of the
Era, encouraged his young contributor
Stoddard to abandon verse and adopt
prose. As an incentive for this change he
offered the tempting compensation of a
dollar a column. Mr. Cox's contributions
required illustration and so many difficul
ties were encountered.
In 1875 Palmer Cox went to New York.
There he buckled down to a life of study
and work. Tne great artists occupied the
held, and there seemed to be no way of
getting ahead on the old lines. New ideas
were demanded. Cox went to Central
Park and studied the animal*. He
sketched them as beings attired in human
habilaments, and, writing his story around
the sketch, made the animals talk of their
lot in Hie, and such pathetic talk it was
that the boys and girls who lead St.
Nicholas had much sympathy for the fox
and bear.
Publishers demanded the stories and
sketches, but still Mr. Cox had higher
ideals, and finally it struck his fancy to
sketch the "Brownie?." His memory
held a shadowy impression of fireside
legends concerning fairies of Scotland
who were invisible to mortal eyes. These
elves were all of the male persuasion, so
the tradition said, and according to per
sons gifted with second sight, the only
human beings who could see them, the
"Brownies," were iolly, laughing littie
fellows, who lived in the night, like some
of the. boys of this modern epoch, and
sought seclusion at tno first slant of sun
beams.
The "brownie" sketches and stories
scored an instant su-jcess. The publish
ers were besieged by inquiring subscribers
who wanted to know more than tiie con
tributor knew about the literature of the
tradition, and Cox himself had to delve
and dig in ancient lore to keep up with
the pace of his own setting. He proved
that the '"Brownies" lived in the lore of
Scotland away back in the fourteenth cen
ury. King James spoke of them, but he
fancied that they were stalwart goblins.
Obviously Palmer Cox's imagination
supplied what was lacking or shadowy in
tradition. He accepted one fairy tale as
the basis of his work. The narrative de
picted the "Brownies" all of the male sex,
as full of fun and pranks, but very helpful
to people in need or in distress.
As the tradition goes the good house
wife, whose knitting was unfinished at
night, left it for the Brownies to do. She
also left milk for the elves. If the work
of spading the garden was not done the
man of the house left some malt lor the
Brownies to brew. When morning came
the mystic power of the Brownies had
done the knitting and spaded the garden.
In this way the Brownies came to be re
garded as helpful spirits.
To please the children Cox gave the
Brownies of his imagination a broad
laughing face, bulging eyes and a baby's
bold head and short neck. The legs of a
sprite were given to the body of a man.
All the world of little people talked about
the Brownies, and Cox i>ad to work like
the old Harry to keep up with the de
mand for rhymes and pictures which St.
Nicholas and Harper's Young People de
manded.
Finally, a whole raft of Brownies was
floated, and then came the inevitable de
mand to put them on the stage. To get
some girls in the play Mr. Cox introduced
fairies such as Ida Mulle, and to get men
of size demons were brought in. The
little fairy ladies weigh 96, 97 or 98 pounds.
The Brownies are fifteen or twenty pounds
heavier. The demons are strapping big
actors, and they invite Vulcan to destroy
the fairies and the Brownies with iire and
flood. Tne Goddess of Mirth is invoked to
save the elves from the wrath of Vulcan.
This is the third season of the Brownie
company, but the spectacle is now
west of the Mississippi River for ibe first
time. The players will show at the Baldwin
Theater this evening.
AN ABANDONED BABE.
It Was Found on the Front Steps of
, 114 liawthorne Street.
A newly born baby girl was taken to the
Receiving Hospital Tuesday night in the
patrol wagon and was tenderly cared for
by Mrs. Edmonds, the matron.
Policeman John Mullen, while patrol
ling his beat, saw a bundle on the front
stens of 11-t Hawthorne street, which runs
from Folsom street south, bttweet Second
and Third. He thought it his duty to
make an investigation ana was surprised
to see the baby. He inquired of the occu
pants of the house if they knew anything
about who left the baby on the doorstep,
but they did not know it was ttiere.
Mullen fang for the patrol wagou and sent
the baby to^he hospital.
The baby was very poorly dressed, the
material being the plainest kind. Wrapped
round it was an old drab cloak that had
been worn by a little girl. There was no
paper or anything that could give a clew
to the parents.

Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. The top fltrurea
at RtatVon indicate maximum tpmppratnre for the
days; tho-te underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means hlsrh barometric pressure and
is usually acc6niDanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain*.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in tho interior
aud low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature . rain soujh of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California roast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS. v
rmCAGO, Tix.. Dec 16. â The approaching
holidays have the effect of restricting speculative
business in the grain markets. While wheat dis
plays a fair amount or activity, It is far from
being as animated as it was a few weeks ago.
S.-alpers took care of things to-day. The liver
poo, quotations were weak and lower, 1 rices here
opening in the same condition, responsive to the
cables. | '1 he Northwest receipts were light at 377
cars, against 629 last Wednesday and 858 a year
ago. ;
The falling off noted in those arrivals communi
cated a firmer feeling to the market after tne
opening. Receipts at Chicago were 26 cars. Heavy
exports from Atlantic ports, 570,800 bushels.
caused a spurt about the middle of the session, but
during the last hour, on realizing by buyers, prices
drooped abont a cent. Closing Pars cab.es were
lower. Berlin higher and Antwerp unchanged.
May wheat opened from 805/ 8 c to 80y 2 c. sold be
tween 81 Vac and 79% c, closing at 79% Ci IVfeSO

market was not affected by anything whic occu -
red to-day. - The inactivity received accentuation
irom the all around quiet existing. The tone of
the market, was irregular, prices Hardening or
weakening with the- corresponding feeling In
wheat. Receipts were 1.'.0 cars and 45,000 bush

-7Â»5 bushels.. May corn opened at 2&^%@2b%c,

for to-morrow 325 cars. ; â¢
OaTÂ«- Ran 10 quiet and weakness. Receipts
were 86 cars and 17,200 bushels were withdrawn
from store. The action of prices was simply with
reference to the mood of wheat. Exuort dearauces

Effect of Exposure to tho X Ray. 1 â
The Electrical Review contains a brief
account of some experiments made by
Professor Elihu Thomson, the well-known
electrical authority, upon himself to de
termine whether X rays act strongly on
the tissues. He exposed his little finger
for half an hour within a quarter of an
inch of the platinum electrode of an ex
cited tube. No decided effect followed for
over a week; then the finger reddened,
became extremely sensitive, swollen, sun
ana to a certain extent painful. Alter
seventeen days had elapsed the finger
still remained quite sore. He thinks the
results indicate chemical activity of the
Roenigen rays of like character to high
pitch waves of light in causing sunburn,
but penetrates more deeply into the tis
sues. _

Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 16. f
This city has been berelt of its only
â¢Vestige of genuine blue-blooded British
aristocracy. Jt is true that there are sev
eral people leit here who may claim large
estates in the old country and assert that
if they had their rights they would be
.. barons or dukes, but the only nobleman
whose credentials were absolutely beyond
the pale of doubt has shaken the dust of
Oakland from his feet. Lord Sholto aud
Lady 1> aulas have departed.
Mrs. Mooney, mother-in-law to his lord
s-l.ip, declares ;hat too much publicity has
I bad such an effect on the modest tempera
-1 ment of her son-in-law that he has decide J
â  ta go to some place where the freaks of a
* British lord w.ll not prove of general in
â¢ t.rest. â  Just where he is at present
â . -mother-in-law Mooney declines to state,
.: but the aristocrats have aurely been
â  driven from this city.
"His lordship w:is spending his money
â¢ here," says Mrs. Mooney, "and was cay
â¢. ing his way. But he has been forced to
leave because everything he did brought
him into notoriety, and his ciÂ«ar wife,
m.y daughter, Lady Sholto, has also been
actually driven from the city where she
was born, through the same means.''
Oiher relatives and friends of his lord
ship share Mrs. Mooney's opinion and de
, : clare that a British lord "w:;o pays h.s
â¢wav" should be at least permitted to re
â¢....''ciain on this side the bay.
. .'.â¢/. The origin of the trouble that led to the
â¢ : .;r.excdus of aristocracy from these shores is
;â¢â  "now of o d date, Lut the last straw that
': â  broke tlie camel's back was a iittle troub.e
â /â .":' af the Macdonoueh 'i heater over apiece
...'. of pasteboard. The doorkeeper reported
:'â ' .the Jit tie incident one way, but his lord
v;.i'hip and Mrs. Mooney told a totally d:f
'â¢â â  â  ferent story, and the disinterested reader
.â â¢â .â¢â¢. had to take his choice.
:..'.. .Mrs. Mooney says she 3trove hard to
C. have the false report officially contra
â "'./dieted, but met with no success, and the
â¢>:_ doorkeeper at the theater stuck to his
..-: "story that his lordship only purcha ed
â â¢â¢". one ticket and let the lady see the show
". alone, so it was a case of choose between
â¢: .".the two.
Mrs. Mooney asserts that Lord Sholto
: did not leave his wite throug outthewho^e
. . of the show. She now declares seriously
; .-. that the trouble was due to his lordship's
.' .'la.cK of memory and his latch key. 4- L rd
. â = Sholto fonrot nis latch key on that event
;â  ful evenintr," said Mrs. Mooney, "and he
returned home for it, and immediately

his inr*Hlnp and dear Loretta have left ns,

MISS PARDEE'S DEATH.
Her Large Estate Will Now Go to Her
Ha f-Bruther, George C.
Fardee.
OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 16.â Miss Nellie
Pardee, daugnter of the late E. H. Pardee,
died this morning after an illness of sev
eral weeks. The deceased was not 16 years
of age, and was always a delicate child.
The recent death of her father also helped
to bring about the end. She was naturaliy
a bright girl, and when illne-s overtoot
her was pursuing a sr.eciul course at the
Oakland High School.
The death of Miss Nellie Pardee will
cause a radical change in the disposition^
pf the estate of her father, who died last
September. One of the clauses of the will
pave Nellie a certain amount of real and
personal property, to which, as her heir,
her moiher would have succeeded. The
estate, however, has not been distributed
or the will admitted to probate. Under
another clause of the will the property
â¢bequeathed to Nellie will go to Dr. George
C. Pardee, as it is expressly declared that
in the event of the death of Nellie Pardee,
or the Aidow before t â distribution of t.ie
e^'a:e, the property should ro to the sr>n.
Tne valuable Pardee House on Telegraph
avenue was left to Nellie with other prop
erty, and tlie widow will now have 1.0
right to anything but the Aicata House
on S-.m Pablo avr-nue and a homestead not
to eiceea $10,000 in value, wnich is to be
provided .'or her by tbe executors.

A Notice About lielits the Sequel to a
Si ciety Function.
OAKLAND. Cal.. Dec. JO.â About a
â year ago Miss Zua Daniels and Charles R.
Starkweather, a well-known merchant of
this city, were married. The groom was
n score of years older than the bride, but
for several months everything went well
: 'and it seemed to be a regular love-match.
' : Mr. Starkweather now lives in his pretty
. home alone and his wife of a year is back
with her parents*. The world was in
,: â formed of this change of condition by a
'â  -lft tie notice wbicli the husband inserted
iii to-day's pa* er?, Saying that his
.wife le,ft liia home September 2S and that
'. he wili not be responsible ior her debts.
;' He refused to say any more than v con
â  4alnec) In the notice, but the lady's rola
...'tives-say ti,;it it W3s a case of too much
â¢â¢"mother-in-law and a cranky husband.
: - There was more or less quarreling for the
,; past two month?, but the end came when
â¢*. one of the wife's brothers called at tne
â¢â¢..iieu-se to take his sister to an entertain
ment. Wlien they returned at 11 o'clock
.' thi'y found that Mr. Starkweather had
.-Voiced them out. Repeated knocking
.brought no one to the door. The broth-r
. and sister went home and she has stayed
" there since.

Aristocratic Democrat* Sued for Vlo-

OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 16.â Democratic
County Central committeemen have not
produced the ?4 per caoi;a that alone

dragged into court, and this afternoon
John Stewart filed neary 100 suits in the
Justices' court against the men who
manipulated the Budd campaign. All the
defendants are members of the old com
mittee, and they seem to have the opinion
that when the Brosnahan committee suc
ceeded them thre months a#o that the
responsibility of their deb s would not
follow them. Collector Stewart has been
forced to brine suit to prevent the claim
for music, refreshments, red fire and band

COLLEGE AND RELIGION
President Kellogg Says the
Church SfcouM Follow the
Students.
He Declares That Al Colleges Have
a Tendency Toward In
fiielity.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 16.â At the
meeting of the Oakland Presbytery in
.Berkeley last night President Martin Kel
logg of the State University replied to the
frequently repeated charge that the uni
versity is a "godless" institution by say
ing that there is more or less infidelity in
all institutions of learning, and that it
cannot be shut out.
"Yale, Anihent, Princeton," said he,
"and the other great colleges, to which we
all look as models, have the same tenden
cies that exist here. The disturbing in
fluences cannot be shut out, even if the
university is of th* mo.-t profound Chris
tan i}'pe. The student encounters forces
t<-miine to und'-rmine the old faith, in
literature, in magazines ima in news
papeis. These things have to be met in
all colleges.
"If Christianity cannot be taught in
our university itcan be tanghi around it.
The effective force 3 are a generous Chris
tian fellowship free from cant, a manly
pulp ; t and a readiness to di?cuss all that
comes up. It is the church's duty to fol
low the students into the godless institu
tion and sound alter them the divine sum
mons.

BERKELEY, ( al.. Dec. 16.â "1 did not
come to California on business," said Dr.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1596.
ONE BRIDE WAS
IN SECLUSION
Double Wedding at Which
Only Two Were
United.
Ensign May Dries Declined to
Figure in a Public Army
Marriage.
The Audience Thought the Second
Coup c Was tbe Bridesmaid and
Best Man and Were Content.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 16. )
There was to have been a double wed
ding; in Alameda last night. Two Salva
tion lassies were to have become the brides
of two bold soldiers of the cross. At the
last moment one of the brides-elect re
fused to be a party to the dual event.
For several weeks the War Cry has con
tained a big advertisement of the great
event when Major Keppel should perform
the operation of making four into two,
and when the doors of Linderraann's
Opera-huuse were opened last night it was
not known that there had been a forced
change in the programme.
The peculiar part of the ceremony was
that the bride and groom and bridesmaid
and best man were so mixed up on the
platform that tbe audience was of tbe
opinion that it had seen both couples
married, and as nothing was Raid by Major
Keppel to the contrary, tbe large audience
went home satisfied that it had actually
seen the double wedding. No one but
those Salvationists intimately acquainted
with the parties in evidence was aware
that something had gone wrong, and
every morning paper without exception
proclaimed to tbe world that last night
Alameda was the scene of a double Salva
tionist wedding.
Ensign Wilbert and Lieutenant Mary
Lyons were duly married, but the brides
maid and groomsman were not. There
was but one wedding, and to-day it was
made known why the other half of tbe
biled programme dii not come off.
Captain George Anderson, who on ac
count of his nature is Known as "Happy
George," was unhappy for once in his life.
He was the bridegroom-elect who was to
have taken Ensign MisÂ« Dries for his wife,
but each is still single, although there has
been no breach in their mutual affection.
Miss Dries apparently was not consulted
about 'Setting the day" and has no desire
to enter the matrimonial state for several
weeks, consequently, when she discov
ered that her wedding was being used as
one-half of the double attraction, without
her consent, she very forcibly declaied
that t ere would be a hitch in the pro
gramme. As the affair had been billed
for several weeks there is some surprise
that Miss Dries did not make known her
opposition until the hour before the event
was to take place. Miss Dries is firmly
opposed to a public wedding, and declares
t hat her nuptials shall be private and shall
take place only wheÂ« she feels so inclined.
The rules of the army for the govern
ment of officers are very strict, but there
is nothing which can compel a loving
young coupie to appear before the altar at
a certain time, and while Mis* Dries ana
"Happy George" are still as the apple of
the eye to each other they were not mar
ried lost night, as many thousand people
were led to believe.

SINGS FOR CHARITY.
Sllia Ellen Beach Yaw Gives a Concert
at the Baldwin for the Chil
dren's Hospital.
A concert was given Tuesday night at the
Baldwin Theater by the Ellen Beach Yaw
Company for the benefit of the Children's
Hospital, but largely, no doubt, owing to
the weatfeer and the shortness of the
notice, the audience was a very meager
one.
Miss Yaw sang with her usual sweetness
BRIGADIER KEPPEL of the Salvation Army, Who Wants to
Give a Bigr Christmas Dinner to the Poor.
and was lioeral in the matter of encores.
The "Laughing Song," by Auber, which
she gave as an encore to "Ah Fors'e Lvi,"
from the "Traviata," was again her great
est success. The operatic aria from the
"Traviata" was too dramatic fcr her voice,
thou h she shone in the coloratura with
which she infused it.
Her other numbers were "L'Eco," by
Celli, and "Spring Flowers," by
Reinsche, with vioin obligate "Bird of
the Springtime, " arranged for her by
Rundegger. was an encore that won warm
applause.
Maximilian Dick again charmed with
his violin playing, the "Faust Fantasie,"
arrange 1 by Sarasate, being especially
well played. Miss Lay again accompanied
sympathetically.
Tne concert netted $150 for the Chil
dren's Hospital.
LAW FOR STOCKHOLDERS
Entitled to Have a Weekly Re
port From Superintendents
of Their Mines.
Supreme Court Discussed the Bearing
of a California Ac( Upon Do
mestic Corporations.
A decision has been handed down in the
Supreme Court which is of interest to
stockholders in California mining compa
nies. William E. Miles, the plaintiff in
the suit, was a stockholder in the Bodie
Consolidated Mining Company, and
brought an nction against R. B. Wood
ward, a director in the comrany, to re
cover $1000, liquidated damases, for a vio
lation ol the provisions of the act of April
23. 1880. The violation complained of was
the alleged failure, refusal and neglect of
the directors to make public the weekly
reports of the superintendent, as required
by the act. The case going against Miles
in the lower court he appealed and the
Supreme Court Has reversed the judgment
and order and remanded the cause for a
new trial.
In tne opinion, which was written by
Justice Hensl.aw, the constitutionality of
the act was discussed. Tiie question con
cerning constitutionality was raised on
the point that the act operates only upon
domestic corporations, and thereby allows
foreign corporations to transact business
within this State upon more favorable
conditions than are presented by law to
similar corporations organized under tne
laws of this State, in violation of article
XIII, section 15, of the constitution.
Concerning thi< interesting claim, Jus
tice Henshaw Baid that the laws of this
State do not have extraterritorial force.
Over the organization and internal gov
ernment oi foreisru corporations it hÂ«3 no
powers of control. It would be meaning
less for this State to try to legislate upon
the internal affairs of such foreign cor
porations, and it has not attempted to
do so.
Tne law is designed to protect stock
holders of domestic corporations. It does
not relate to the business of the corpora
tion nor impose buruens or restrictions
upon domestic corporations in the con
duct of their business from which cor
porations are relieved, but pertains as ex
clusively to corporate management as do
the code provisions relating to ;he organi
sation ana conduct of savings and loan
corporations, street railroad corporations
and all corporations whose internal af
fairs are more or leÂ«s carefully regulated
by the laws of this State.
In another place Jastice Henshaw finds
that the act does not apply only to those
mining corporations which extract old or
silver from ores and quartz, and the law is
not unconstitutional as special legislation.
The rehearing is granted by reason of er
ror made by the trial court.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
TO TRY TO FEED
THREE THOUSAND
Contributions for the Sal
vation Army Dinner
Are Slow.
Eager to Supply Food for a
Legion of Hungry
Men.
School Chi'dren Have Taken the
Matter in Hand and Will Aid
With Collections.
"Please help us cheer the friendless."
In largo red letters that motto is placed
conapicuously about tlie City. At the
entrance to churches, in places of amuse
ment, in saloons, in fact nearly every
where it greets the eye.
And that is tne way the Salvation Army
ha-i of reminding people that Christmas is
nearing. The army is preparing a grand
annual dinner and it needs money, ar.d a
whole lot of it. It takes a great many bU',
round dollars to buy provisions for 3000
men, women and chiidren and the army
expi-cts to feed that number on Christmas
day.
There are only a very few days between
now and Christmas and kind people who
intend to adi their contributions to those
already sent in are urged to do so as soon
as possible. Brigadier Keppel says the
donations are coming in very slowly, but
he doesn't feel discouraged, for as yet
many of the people have not been aroused
and the weather has been bo stormy that
soliciting funds and clothing has neces
sarily been delayed.
The school children have become inter
estedinthat dinner, and that one thing
alone assures the success. Collections
are being made in nearly all the schools,
but the returns are not yet in. However,
the army expects that their aid will
sw<'H the funds greatly.
The army is fitting up a store at 862
Folsom street, and will store all donu
tions there until the time arrive for
their distribution among the poor. The
following donations wire received yes
terday:
Donations of food and clothing from the
Douglas, Marshall, Reading and Sheridan
primary schools; clothing and papers
from 330 Hyde street; J. F. Harland, Wil
lows, Colusa County, seven cloaks ; Pacific
Lumber Company, 500 feet redwood lum
ber; planine mills, Tenth street, 250 feet
lumber; a lady from Geary street, three
bundles ot clothing.
DR. ADAMS INSTALLED.
The New Pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church Ik Formally UJvon
Charge or His Flock.
Rev. George C. Adams, D.D.,wasT.: s lay
evening installed as pastor of the F.rst
Congregational Churchâ that of the Jate
Dr. Brown. The services were impressive
and beautiful, the welcome and the tender*
of the hand of fellowship most hearty.
The exercises began with an organ pre
lude, followed by "It is a good thing to
give thanks unto the Lord" Dy the choir.
The invocation and Scripture lesson was
read by Rev. Pnilip Combe.
Tne sermon was delivered by Rev. C. R.
Brown and tne installing prayer by Rev.
George Mooar, D.D.
The choir rendered "Prepare ye the
way of the Lord, ir and then the pastor was
formally received into tbe membership ot
the church. With him George C. Adams
and family were also received as members.
Rev. H. N. Hoyt, D.D., of the First
Church of Sacramento delivered tlie
charge to the pastor. It was quite elo
j quent. "Here," he said, "under the win
dows of your watch-towers sail the ships
j of commerce, weaving a web of tremendous
interest between the nations near and far
of the earth. It is for yon to place your
hands upon this woof â more than that, to
help to make the threads. It is a sublime
opt ortunity."
Rev. William Rader extended the right
hand of fellowship. In the "course of L|i
address he said: "'The man who occupies
the pulpit of the First Congregational
Church occupies the very center of the
citadel of Congregationalism on the Paci
fic Coast. Here is a large population of
Chinese retaining all the vices and many
of the virtues oi that oid people; here are
20,000 Italians; here more tongues are
spoken than were heard in Jerusalem on
the day o. Pentecost. It is one of the
worst and one of the best cities in the
Unittrd States."
Rev. J. K. HarriÂ«on delivered the ''Salu
tations of the Hume Missionary
Churchea" and Rev. E. S. Chaoman "The
Charge to the People."
After a prayer and a hymn the new
pastor pronounced the benediction to his
new flock.
Not a great number were present and oi
these only a sprinkling were members of
the church.

Beaten a Neck After a

Handicap.
Hay market Fan Burmah 4o a

cap Event.
Lucky Eog Won ia a Big Gallop.
Etta H Tcok a Race From A-am
Andrew on the Wire.
A much better class of horses "--ere en
tered in the differjnt events at Oakland
yesterday, and there was an increased
attendarcs in consequence. All the mud
larfcs quartered on ihe track are now re
ceiving hurried "preps" and are assem
bling in full force. Although tne sky was
threatening the rain drops failed to fail
ami the track was sticky and holding.
Favorites finished in front on three occa
sions.
The mile handicap furnished but four
starters, but Sir Play and Schiller put up
a finish that made up for any lack ot entries.
Green Morns' horse was an even-money
chance, with Schiller a strongly played 7
to 5 stcond choice. The favorite was
quickest away from the barrier and Jones
hustled him away at a great rate. Schil
ler began closing up the intervening
leghtcsof dayligut separating him from
the leader when they got straightened
awiiy lor the wire, and soon boih Jones
and Slaughter were driving hard. Through
a streak of diplomacy in carrying Slaugh- J
ter out a few yards toward the outsi.ie,
Jones .'anded his mount hrst, a neck
ahead of Barney Schreiber's colt, in the
fast time of l:4i]4. Lincoln was outran
from tbe jump. riiiHuing a poor third.
The mile and a quarter handicap hurdle
event was another close affair and the i
handicapper is entitled to much credit for |
the clever adjustment of weights. Bur- \
mah, with 14b pounds up, and Mike Hen- !
nessy in the sadiile, ruled an even-money |
favorite, with one erirenaely heavy play j
on Three Forks, who was played dowr. to
2to 1 from fours. Peters astride the latter
horse cut out a rattling pace, showing the
â way to the stretch, when the favorite be
gan closing on him. While the pair were
fighting it out Stanford brousnt Hay
rnarket up. and passing Three Forks, was ;
beaten out but a head by the tirsi choice I
in a hard drive.
Although the "dope" books demonstrate
the fact that Midlo does not fancy gluey
goins, he opened favorite over Lucky ;
Dos for the purse in tbe opening six-fur- I
long selling dash. The latter closed favor
iie, though, and won in a common canter
(rom old Braw Scot. The black horse
Charles A was third, a head away.
Thirteen two-year-olds then started in a
five and a haliiurlonc scramble. Adam
Andrew, the Burns <fc Waterbouse entry,
was ahot 3 to 2 favorite, but in a bard drive
â¢was beaten out a head by Etta H, a 6 to
1 shot, cleverly ridden by "Skeets" Martin.
Torpedo was a close third.
Tue bald-faced enigma Thornhill again
turned up like a bad dollar in tbe mile
and a quarter run, decided under selling
conditions. At one lime as good as Bto 1
in the betting, he took the lead soon after
the start and was never afterward headed,
leading out the 7 to 10 favorite All Over
two lengths at the wire. Fred Gardner, a
5 to 1 chance, was a fair third.
Notes.
The attention of horsemen is called to
the fact entries to the great stallion stakes
to be deeded at Hawthorne track, Chi
cago, in 1898, will close on January I, 1897.
It will be one of the richest stakes to be
contested for that year.
Jockey Sam Doggett visited the tracks
yesterday, but was not seen up in the
saddle. Sam is very popular here and will
not go wanting for mounts.
E. J. Baldwin's Eastern string arrived
from Santa Anita ranch yesterday morn
ing, at which place they have been re?t
-m; up for a couple of weeks. The horses
are in charge of the favorably known and
competent trainer Frank Taylor, consid
ered one of the beit in his lineof business.
About the best of tne lot are Ramiro and
Celoso, the latter filly a recent stake-win
ner in the far East.
There was a noticeable falling off in the
number of books cutting-in yesterday, and
various reasons are assigned for it. Among
others it is said several of the Eastern
bookies are disgruntled at the way Mr.
Ferguson has been sendingcertain heavily
played horses away to the serious detri
ment of other starter in the race, aDd

again the changing about of horses in
positions while at the barrier has dis
pleased them. When Joe Terry, the
favorite, wain left at the post on Monday
and All Over rolled in there was a big
howl. Some members of the booking
fraternity <io not like the idea of havine
members of Ihe Oakland association rush
into the judges' stand whenever a ques
tion of nicety arises, as when Scotch Jrtose
ran away on Monday, and that set the
grumblers agog.
They say the judges, supposed to be
com v>etent. men, are appointed to that
position to make ruiint-s. and if iuey are
incorrect in their decisions let the board
of stewards then act. Altogether matters
across the bay are not running as
smooth as they might.

SUTRO WILL NOT SIGN.
The Mayor Advised That the
Hail 0; Justice Contract
Is Illegal.
Taylor Rogers S ys That the Super
visors Have Not Complied With
the Statutes.
Tayior Rogers, as attorney for Mayor
Sutro, has rendered an opinion that the
entire proceedings under which the con
tract for the Hall of Justice was let were
illegal. As a consequence the Mayor will
probably refuse to sign the contract with
Bateman Bros., the successful bidders,
which is now in his hands, and there are
| prospects of a legal tangle before the con
â  struction of the building can be begun.
" A committee of contractors who expect
j to receive sub-contract* lrom Bateman
| Bros, were in conference with the Mayor
i yesterday and Mr. Sutro told them that he
would have to be better satisfied with the
legality of the contract than be is at pres
ent before he will sign.
The contract was originally turned over
to Mr. Kogers when first presented to the
Mayor for inspection as the secretary of
i the office. He found many flaws that
were formulated and presented to the
City's chief executive. He was then asked
I to put the matter into the form of a lezal
opinion and the result was presented to
Mr. Sutro yesterday.
Mr. Kogers rests his chief objection on
the section of the statutes which says that
when any such public work is contem
plated and a tax levied for it there niuat
be a puolic need for the improvement.
He said that he had failed to find any
where in the proceedings of the Board of
Supervisors a declaration that the pro
| posed building was a public need.
In his opinion there is no public need,
! the City Hall being amply lar*e to con
! tain ell of the departments intended for
i the Hall of Justice. The tax levy which
raised the money is declared by Mr. Rog
ers to be illegal for tnis reason, and also
for the reason that the Morgue building,
for which a part of tne money is to be
used, was not mentioned in the levy.
The Mayor is declared to be justified in
refusing to sizn the contract. The matter
will be reported at the next meeting of
the Supervisors and some action taken on
; the Mayor's stand

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1596.
SHE LOST BOTH
HUSBAND AND HOME
Serious. Charges Are Filed
Against Michele
Tano.
Accused of Fraud in Obtaining
Possession of Real
Estate.
Allegation Tbat Plaintiff and H:r
Husband Executed a Deed Think
ing; It a Horn stead.
Mrs. Maria Parente, administratrix of
the estate of Augustino Parente, deceased,
has sued Michele Tano for the recovery of
a house and lot on Vincent street, near
the corner of Green, in this City.
The allegations in the complaint filed in
this case and the statements of the per
sons interested would furnish material for
a chapter in an up-to-date mystery novel.
After the deaÂ»a of Parente there was
much talk caused in the circle of acquaint
ances in which he and his wi'e moved in
regard to his taking off. That he died
from the effects ol drinking sulphuric acid
was established by the autopsy, but
whether it was a case of suicide or murder
has not yet been definitely settled in the
minds of some of lm friends. His widow
persists that her late husband was mur
dered, and lays the dreadful accusation at
th? door or one of his former associates.
At the inquest there were several
dramatic scenes, but it did not eppear
that there was any just cause to suspect
any one with causing Parente's death, the
general opinion being that be committed
suicide.
Now comes another phase of this stranee
case with the filing of Mrs. Parente's suit
against Tano. ShÂ« accuses Tano of se
curing tne deed to the Vincent-street
property by fraud and deceit. She aver 3
that on the 23d of ia?t October Tano, pre
tending to be a friend of the fnmily, pre
sented to her and to her husband a docu
ment which he said whs a declaration of
homestead. When Mrs Parente men
tioned that she had previously tiled and
recorded a declaration of homestead on
the property, Tano asserted that it was
defective and of no value or force.
Neither Pareute nor his wife could read
English, and on Tano's assurance that
the paper which he handed them was a
declaration of homestead they signed it
by affixing their mark. As they could
not write each made a cross, and the murk
was attested by witnesses in the usual way
allowed by law.
Mrs. ra rente declares that no considera
tion whatever passed from Tano to her
self or her husband in consequence of the
signing of the deed, though the considera
tion named in the instrument is $10.
In addition to the foregoing statement,
Mrs. Parente sets forth that the pretended
deed, which she and her husband believed
to Dea declaration of homestead* was not
recovered until the 2d of December, long
after the death of Parenti, her husband,
and that no demand was made by Tano
for possession of the properly, nor for the
rents, issues or profits thereof.
For relief Mrs. Parente asks that Tano
be required to produce the pretended dt-ed
in court, that it be declared void and that
it be canceled.
J. A. Spinetti, attorney for M r s. Parente,
represents his client to be in a pitiable
condition. She is so greatly depressed on
account of the death of her husband that
she is scarcely able to care for herself and
her riye children, who would be left penni
less if Tano's deed to their little home
should be fou,nd to bd leeal. There was
considerable trouble between Mr. and
MrÂ«. Parente just prior to his death, and
the belief of some of his friendÂ« is that
marital infelicity led to hi 3 self-destruc
tion. Tano is blamed hy some for alleged
interference in the affairs of the Parente.
family. The case has attracted consider
able attention in the Lat n quarter, where
all the participants of this rucdern drama
tragedy are well known.
A Contvactor Sued.
The United States lias lent Its name to the
prosecution of an action in the United States
District Court in a case of the Burnham Stane-
I ford Company against F. L. Hanson, Otto H.
: Greenwald and C. A. Warren. Hansen had a
contrnct with the military authorities to erects
com pauy barracks at the Presidio. The other
two weie his bondsmen. Hanson faili-d to
complete the contract, and at Ihe time cf his
failure to do bo he owed the Burnham Siane
| lord Company $2348 15â minus SJSOO paid
I subsequentlyâ for uiiilwovk. The action is
j against the bondsmen as well as the con
tractor, and under the law the United States
can lead its utimc to such an action.

LIST HOPE OF
LONG GREEN
It Depends Upon the De
cision of Judge San
derson.
WAS IT A PRIZE-riGHT 1
The Civic Federation Will Put
on the Gloves Before the
Grand Jury.
WILL DEMAND INDICTMENTS.
L J. Truman of ths Federation Pro
nounces the Affair a Disgrace
to the State.
H. I. Kowaisky, representing the Fitz-
Eimmons end of the $10,000 controversy,
after consultation yesterday with Attor
ney David Freiaenrich, decided that no
deposition would be taken to-day when
the case is called ia Judge Sanderson's
court.
W. H. L. Barnes will present his motion
to dissolve the injunction against the pay
ment of the $10,000 check, and will base
the motion on the ground that the affair
in which Sharkey and Fitzsimmons en
gaged at the Pavilion on the night of
December 2, was a prize-fight, pure and
simple, contrary to the laws of this State,
making it a felony as against all partici
pants in it.
"Barnes' stand is untenable," stated
Attorney Kowaisky yesterday. "A prize
fight and a glove contest are two distinct
things. The former is prohibited by law
and would never have been permitted by
the authorities. On the other hand, a
boiine contest, such as we claim took
place, is sanctioned by law, and was con
ducted under proper supervision and with
the consent of the Supervisors and the
police.
"The whole matter is quite plain to me,"
added Mr. Kowaisky, "General Barnes is
interested only in the civil end of the case,
and no doubt on a contingent fee. He is
after that $10,000, and will do all in his
power to reach it regardless of subsequent
disagreeable possibilities.
"For instance, say the court should dis
solve tne injunction, taking the ground
that it has no jurisdiction in settling con
troversies emanating from prize fighting
or other felonious engagements between
parties, see in what a position all con
cerned will be placed. Tney wiiJ virtually
be branded by the court as having com
mitted a felony, and the result may be
disastrous, not only to Barnes' clients, but
to all the people who have had anything
to do with the unfortunate affair."
I. J. Truman of the Civic Federation
had a little sometning to say yesterday
regarding the proceedings in JudgÂ« San
derson's court.
"I am astonished," he said, with con
siderable emphasis, "that the court did
not throw out the whole matter. It was a
perfect disgrace to allow the right and it
is worse now that our courts shouid be
called upon to settle the differences
arising from such illegal proceedings."
"Our body will not meet until Monday,
when we will unquestionably discuss this
prize-light business. I suppose that any
action we may take will be more or less
severe according to the action or decision
of Judge Sanderson.
"If it be shown that a felony was com
committed I believe prosecution should
follow. If the affair was not a prize-fight,
but was simply a glove contest, I believe
some effort should be made to put a stop
such engagements in this City."
Sharkey Is Sued.
J. J. Raver, assignee of Billy Smith,
one of Sharkey's trainers, has brought
suit against the latter to recover $900 for
services rendered. The claim is made
that when Sharkey was preparing for his
meeting with Fitzsimmons Smith was in
constant attendance upon him and ren
dered services to the value of $1000, only
$100 of which he had received.
Another Suit Against Sharkey.
J. J. Raver, as the assignee of GÂ°orge
Allen, one of tne pugilists who trained
Sharkey for his fight with Fitzsimmons,
ha 3 begun suit against the sailor pug. The
complaint alleges that Allen expended
much time and energy in fitting the
mariner for the battle with tne Cornish
man, and that he received but little
recompense thereior. He demands that
he be paid $299 additional for his services.
Raver has still further tied up the famous
$10,000 certificate of deposit by placing
garnishments in the suit on the Anglo-
California Bank, where the money is on
deposit, and on one Dowdelle. who is sup
posed to have in his possession the cer"
tinea te.
LIGHTWEIGHT PUGILISTS.
Gans and Hawkins Will Be Matched
After They Have Finished Talking.
Jim Neil, the ex-manager and trainer of
Dal Hawkins, is anxious to match his
protege against Gans, the colored ligtit
weight, of Baltimore, under the same con
ditions the pugilists fought in the East.
Al Herford, the manager of Gans, says
that his cnarge cannot possibly reduce to
the weight demanded by Hawkins' man
ager, which is 128 pounds. Herford states
that Gans was weak when he faced his
opponent the last time they met and that
he journeyed to this City under the im
pression that the contest here would be
fought at catchweights. It is safe to pre
dict that a match will be consummated
and that the pugilists will agree upon
fighting at 130 pounds. It is also safe to
say that Gans will prove to the lovers of
NEW TO-OAT.

Unless some of the clubs guaranteed
Gans another match in this City it is only
reasonable to presume that he would not
daily on this coast for any length of time.
Hawkins will sell at a very small figure in
case he is matched against the Eastern
crackerjack, which he certainly will be
after the managers have finished their
little all-in-the-play discussion over a few
pounds' weight.
VERY BAD SEWERAGE.
How Contractors Are Favored and the
Law .Dodged at. the City and
County Hospital.
On September 28 last the sum of $10,000
was appropriated by the Board of Super
visors foi repairs to the City and County
Hospital. It was well Known at that time
that the hospital was sadly in need of a
new sewerage system above all other re
pairs of urgent necessity. Doctors and
nurses were being laid up with malarial
fever for lack of it.
When the money was appropriated it
was then believed that contracts for the
work would be let without delay, as mat
ters had reached such a critical stage that
loss of time was regarded as dangerous.
To follow out this method, however,
would not give ceneral satisfaction to
those in control of the proposed repairs.
The consolidation act provides that all
City work amounting to $300 or over shall
be awarded by contract to the lowest re
sponsible bidder in open competition.
This is easily avoided by letting out
large contracts, la the aggregate. reaching
into the thousands, and paying for the
work in bills of less than $500 each. Th<3
contracts would not appear as such, how
ever, and consequently there is no power
to stop the system of paying in small bums.
Nothing was heard of the wort at the
City and County Hospital until James J.
Flynn presented his demand to tiip clerk
of the Board of Supervisors for $480 for
whitewashing. This was paid a month
ago. On December 4 Flynn presented
another demand for kalsomining five
wards and three operating-rooms, $323.
This latter bill was passed by the Board
of" Supervisors at Monday's session and
has now gone on its way toward the
Treasurer.
With it went other bills of a similar
nature. The H. G. Lay tig Machine
Works had one in for $420 for "renewal of
steam pipes covered cased with valves and
fittings coniucting with boiler and tanks."
George I. Drew sent in his bill for
$21S 50 for additions to ihe hospital morgue
and the pantry of officers' dining-room.
His bill for thf> month of November
amounted to $144 50, for alterations in
ward 0 and lor labor. E. Alexander's
bill, dated December 8, for material for
sewers and lor labor, was $389 4'?; his bill
dated Decembers, for similar items, was
$44705. John T. Burns had two bills
dated November 21 for repairing a water
tank, $55, and shingling a stable roof. $36.
There* were other bills exceeding the $500
in the aggregate from the Swift Lumber
Company for lumber supplied the hospi
tal for repairs ; and they also went
through.
In this way the $10,000 appropriated is
being eaten up, ana tne only check upon
the bills is the signature of Dr. Stalue,
superintendent of the hospital, under the
printed word "correct." On his signature
the Hospital Committee of the Supervisors
have sinned ami pnssed the bills, which
then went through the board without a
question.
RICH AT ROSSLAND.
Arrival of Â£.. Â». Payton, One of the
Otvuers of the Le Koi.
Among the arrivals at the Palace yester
day was I. N. Peyton, one of the bonanza
kings of Trail Creek, who is en route to
his winter home in Santa Barbara to pass
the holidays with his family.
Mr. Peyton is one of the owners of the
famous Le Koi gold mine at Roasland, a
property shippine, as he says, 150 tons of
ore daily, the average of the ore being
about $4 ( J per ton.
One of Mr. Peyton's partners is ex-Judge
George Turner of Spokane, a leading can
didate for the United States. The mine is
stocked for $500,0C0, the par value of the
shares being $5 each. But the real value
of the shares now is about $S.
Mr. Peyton's home has been at Spokane
for seven or eight years. All this time he
has been engaged in mining. Two or three
years ago he went into Trail Creek, and
as a result has had great success.
"We have paid $250,000 in dividends al
ready," said Mr. Peyton to The Call
representative yesterday, "and it will go
richt along. We are putting in a new
plant of machinery now, and have sunk
a now shaft. As soon as we pet things in
shape, instead of shipping 150 tons a day
we will ship 300 or 400 tons.
"Our ore at present goes to four smel
tersâto Taconia, Everett, East Helena
and to the British Columbia smelter at
Trail. The mine is now 500 feet deep by
the old wordings. The main shaft or in
cline started at an angle of about 35 de
grees, but we straightened it to 50, then to
70, and it is now nearly perpendicular.
The new shaft is straight.
"We are putting in forty drill com
pressors and a new hoist. The ore, which
averages about $40 a ton in gold, carries
also from 3 to 5 per cent of copper and
four or live ounces of 3ilver. The owners
witn me are George Turner, Colonel
Turner, his brother, W. M. Ridpath and
L. F. Williams.
"Rossland, which is now but two and a
half years old, has 7000 inhabitants and is
very prosperous. The Spokane and North
ern Railroad will be completed there this
week. We have no labor strikes there,
and the town is free from rough charac
ters, including prize-fighters. The judges
and constables there are all appointed,
and it seems to work very well.
"Spokane is very prosperous. Over
$1,000,000 was paid into that town in divi
dends last year from the Slocan, Cceur
d'Alene and West Kootenai districts."
Mr. Peyton will return to the north
some time in January.
I>r. Merritt's Millions.
United States Circuit Judge McKenna has
granted the appeal of James P. and Harry
Merritt, who are fighting the trustees of the
Bowdoin College. They are nephews of the
late Dr. Merritt of Oakland. The latter left
his estate to the late Mrs. Garcelon, who
willed about one million dollars to the Bow
doin College. The nephews contested the will
of Dr. Merritt on the ground that it was un
reasonab.e, and they contested in the United
States Circuit Court the currying out of the
bequest of Mrs. Garcelon lor the same reason.
Judge Hawley of the United States Circuit
Court held that the wilt was perfectly legal,
and It is from this decision thai it is desired
to appeal. The case will go now to the United
States Supreme Oourt. Lack of jurisdiction of
the court is the ground upon which the appeal
is taken.
Two Stockton Counterfeiters.
Van Kurn and \V. A. Fletcher, who were
arrested in Stockton by Police Captain Simp
son and Sheriff Cunningham on the 14th inst.
on a charge of counterfeiting, were brought
to this City by Deputy United States Marshal
Gallagher and placed in the County Jail last
evening. Shortly after the prisoners were ar
rested they were arraigned before Court Com
missioner Webster. They waived an exam
ination and were remanded to the custody of
the united etates officers, pending action by
the Federal Grand Jury.
A Fine Concert.
A grand concert for the benefit of the French
Reformed Church will ba given in Golden Gate
Hall to-morrow, the 18th inst. A number of

PLANNING FOR
GREATER OAKLAND
Property-Owners in Import
ant Suburbs Want
Annexation.
Golden Gate, Temescal and Clare
mont Interested in the
Movement.
George P. Morrow Explains the Rea
sons Wny the Change Must
Be Made.
The important movement to have Gol
den Gate, Temescal and Claremont, three
pretty suburbs of Oakland, incorporated
into the larger city is on foot among the
heavier property-owners of the three
places named.
"Greater Oakland !" is the cry of those
most interested, and a determined effort
is to be made at the next municipal elec
tion across the bay to have the project
carried through.
Golden Gate, Temescal and Claremont
have grown until they have become an
important factor in the development of
the eastern shore of the bay, and yet to
day they are backward in the way of
municipal government and protection as
they were five years ago.
Emeryville, which is not more ad
vanced in the way of population and im
provements than the towns named, has
been incorporated as a separate city and
has its own municipal government and
functions. Yet Golden Gate, Claremont
and Temescal have not the semblance of
government, and even police protection,
though little needed, is denied them.
This state of affairs has led to the move
ment looking toward "Greater Oakland,"
and its leaders believe that it will be suc
cessful.
A meeting of property-owners was held
in the ollice of George P. Morrow, the
well-known hay and grain man, yester
day, at which C. E. Knickerbocker, C. A.
Bon and others were present.
It was decided to begin operations at
once, and to raise funds to carry on the
fight. In speaking of the matter yester
day Mr. Morrow said:
"Two years ago Mr. Knickerbocker took
hold of a movement to annex Cl&remont,
Temescal and Golden Gate to Oakland, but
apathy and a lack of appreciation of the
benefits to be derived thereby brought
about defeat at the election, although
Oakland's citizens voted for the propo
sition. Since then a marked change of
sentiment hiis manifested itself In the out
lying district?, and to-day there is hardly
a question but what another election on
slightly different lines would result in a
'Greater Oakland,' more especially as
little Emeryville has now become a 'real
city.' *
"It is high time the Rip Van Winkle
city across the bay awoke and realized the
fact that the districts in question are as
much a part of Oakland itself, and it is of
even more" importance for the people of
these smaller burgs to appreciate the fact
that if they are to grow in importance, to
have sewers, to have sidewalks, to have
increased school facilities, in brief, to be
come metropolitan, they must have muni
cipal government, and just so sure as ripe
apples drop from a tree to the ground, just
so sure and natural is it that these suburbs
must and will fall into the lap of Oakland."
MARRIED IN PRISON.
Thomas Tierney, a Longshoreman From
Crockett, Wedded to Cnssie Kelly.
Thomas Tierney, a longshoreman irom
Crockett, was arrested yesterday morning
at 111>Â£ Minna street by Policeman Hol
land and taken to the Haroor station,
where a charge of betrayal, under promise
of marriage, was booked against him.
The complaining witness was Cassie
Keliy, a young woman, 22 years of age,
living in Crockett. Tierney, who is 29
years of age, came to this City about a
week ago and the girl followed him. She
discoverea where he was living and noti
fied Constable LÂ»>e of Crockett, who

the help of the harbor police in arresting
Tierney.
Tierney was removed to the City Prison
and, after Constable Lee had a talk with
him, he agreed to marry the girl. Lee
took her to the prison and, after a license
had been procured, Justice of the Peace
Kerrigan performed the marriage cere
mony. Mrs. Tierney remained beside her
husband till an order for his release was
procured and the two left the prison to
gether.

TWO JAPANESE
PORTS INFECTED
The Board of Health Makes
Declaration to That
Effect.
Yokohama and Kobe Under the
Ban Because of a Small
pox Epidemic.
City and County Hospital Condemned
as Unsanitary, and a Mew
Building Requested
The Board of Health, at a meeting held
yesterday, declared the Japanese ports of
Yokohama and Kobe, from which reports
of the prevalence of smallpox have re
cently been received, to be infected.
The following resolutions covering the
matter were passed:
Resolved, That the Japanese ports of Yoko
hama uud Kobe are hereby declared infected,
and that the Quarantine Officer of Ihe Port of
San Francisco is hereby directed to remand
to the United States quarantine station at An
gel Island for proper disinfection all passen
gers and baggage coming from these ports.
This resolution shall be so construed as to
apply to passengers from Japan coming over
the Canadian Pacific steamship line via Vic
toria, B. C, as well as to those who come di
rectly to tnis port by the O. & O. and P. M. S.
S. lines.
Dr. Hart called attention to the fact that
for eighteen months past complaints had
been continually coming to the board
about the unsanitary condition of the City
and County Hospital. Ho made the fol
lowing motion in reference to the matter:
That the Board of Supervisors or the Legis
lature, whichever is the proper authority, be
urged at once to proceed with the construc
tion of a new hospital and the removal of the
present charity hospital in this City.
It was decided to attend the meeting
of the National Association of Master
Plumbers, which takas place on Friday
next, in a body.
The Milk and Food Insoector of the
board recommended that the permit of the
Pioneer Dairy Company be revoked be
cause of infractions of tne milk ordinance.
The secretary was ordered to communi
cate with the owners of the dairy and ask
them to appear and show cause why the
permit shall not be revoked.
The complaint of the Mission Five-Mile
Improvement Club against the sanitary
condition of the Monroe Primary School
was referred to the Health officer, who
was ordered to inspect the school and re
port its condition at the next meeting of
the board.
It was decided to require inspectors and
other employes of the board to wear uni
forms after January 1. Tne style of the
uniform is yet to be decided on.
Gajret McEnerney, the attorney of the
board, sent in a written opinion regarding
the powers of the board in reference to
public schools. He showed conclusively
that the board exceeded its authority
when it closed the Mission, Marshall and
Everett schools by force of its inspectors.
In conclusion he said:
If the department of the City government
charged with the education of the children of
the municipality does not co-opernte with the
Department of Health, or, if the parents,
being warned by the officers charged with the
preservation of the public health, persist in
allowing their children to attend schools in
buildings unfit for such a purpose, or in build
ings the condition of which threatens their
health and lives, the responsibility must rest
with them. The Board of Health pertorms its
whole duty when, ascertaining the fact that
buildings so used do menace health and life,
it gives public warning of the fact.
It was decided to urge the Supervisors to
pass the ordinances recently submitted,
prohibiting expectorating in public build
ings, in streetcars, on the sidewalks and
other places.
HUSTLING IN THE MINES.
Henry Atwood on the Work Done,' on
the Mother Lode.
Henry Atwood, owner of the Quartz
Glen gold property, near Mokelunime Hill,
Calaveras County, is at the Grand. Mr.
Atwood has recently sold his property for
a large figure on a bond.
Those who took it, he says, are develop
ing a large body of ore. There are 15S
acres in the property altogether, and it in
cludes a placer claim.
"I have held this property for thirty-six
years," said Mr. Atwood, "and for a long
time it seemed like very slow work getting
any money out of it. I did not get any,
in fact, Jor years. Now that there is no
silver mininjr, or comparatively none,
those who formerly mined for silver are
mining for gold. This has helped
California wonderfully. I never couid
understand why any Californians should
be in favor of silver, when it does not help
out the gold mining industry of this State
in Â»ny way.
"In Tuolumne, Calaveras and Amador
counties especially the mines are looking
fine. It is lively in all these. Not for
twenty-six years has there been such an
interest in mining. It is like ihe old days.
I am very glad to see it, after holding on
so long. I always felt that the time would
come when we would see prosperity in
the gold mines. It has been slow in com
ing, but it is here, and as a result we will
see general prosperity prevail again, in
my judgment, all over the State.
"At the Gwyn mine in Calaveras a 40
-stamp mill has just been completed, and
a run was made on the first lot of ore the
other day. It assayed about $10 a ton.
At this rate there is lots of money in work
ing the property.
"It is about the same with my own
property. The ore can be milled there for
75 cents a ton. We have cheap water
power. We have an 800- foot pressure.
Everything else conspires to make the
niininerand milling one of the cheapest
propositions in the country. I think the
ore there will average $10 a ton. It is
mainly a white quartz, with some ribbon
quartz, with shades of blue. There are
sulphurets in the ore, and with picked lots
you can get ore that will run $1500 a ton."
Mr. Atwood brought a lot of samples of
ore down with him. He was long in the
hotel business in the mountain counties.
He kept the hotel at Big Trees for several
years, and also for a long while ran the
hotel at Murphys. He will remain here
till after the holidays.
