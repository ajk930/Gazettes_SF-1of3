FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 23.â The publica
tion this morning of the story associating
the name of Charles Schweizer with the
attempt to assassinate Solomon Lehman
in July last has set gossip running wild
. up and down the streets of this city.
D. strict Attorney Alva E Snow is said to
have in the statements of witnesses
enough evidence to warrant him in going
to trial immediately if the Grand Jury
shall find an .indictment. He has been
plied with questions all day long by
friends of the persons concerned as to the
character and strength of this evidence.
It is said, moreover, that Lehman him
self, having been out of town for some
days, was not aware of the charges being
made against Schweizer until to-dayâ
â until to-day had listed him as among his
closest friends; until to-day has been un
able to guess why any man should at
tempt his life.
Lehman is a man who is not afraid of
being snot in the open. It is told of him
that his men, employed at the Pine Ridse
sawmill, taking offense one day at some
thing he had done made a united attack
upon him. Single handed he met them
r.nd in two minutes was on the offensive,
three of the men having fallen before his j
blows and the others taking to flight.
Schwe;z?r is a man of quiet demeanor
and gligbi build. Just what attitude Leh
man will assume under the revelations I
that place his trusted friend in the light j
r ing assassins to undo him it will be j
i interesting to note as the days run on, es- \
4>ecially as it will be remembered that the
assassin did wound and very nearly cause
the death of his (Lehman's) little
daughter.
Schweizer still insists, as stated in these
dispatches yesterday, that the charges
against him grow out of a futile attempt
to blacfcmail him. He claims to be able
to prove this. On the other hand, Detect
ive Harrison, at whom this allegation is
aimed, smiles and says the proof is all ou
the otherside.
A chapter of the story has developed to
day â a second chapter in the same sensa
tional line as the firstâ which explains
how the mystery of the attack upon Leh
man took tuis form of clearing up and
how it came to get into the District At
torney's office and finally to be made pub-
Jic. It deals with a second attempt at
assassination, the victim in this instance
being Sam Ralston, a well-known man
about town.
The hired assassin in this case happened
to have no liking for the business, and
besides was a lriend of Ralston, and made
him aware of ,the intent against him.
Ralston was to have been sacrificed be
cause he had become aware of several de
tails of the Lehman affair, threatening
the safety of the instigator. Some:hing
of the vrnole story must be repeated, as it
is told here to-day, with the details that
bave evolved since the publication of this
morning, in order that the somewhat
complicated circumstances may be prop
erly understood.
Solomon Lehman, lately proprietor of
the sawmill on Pine Ridee. was a friend
of Charles Schweizer, the Mariposa-street
harness- dealer. They did considerable
business together one way and another,
and Lehman became indebted to Schwei
zer in a considerable amount. Schweizer,
by way of securing himself, induced Leh
man to take out an insurance policy upon
hss life for some $5000 in his (Schweizer's)
name. Besides this he held securities to
the amount of about $3000. Together
these amounted to much more than Leh
man's indebtedness. Schweizer himself,
it is said, paid the premium on the insur
ance policy, amounting to $130.
It war shortly after that Lehman, rid
ing with his daughter in a buggy, about
duski on a lonely road toward Pine Ridge,
was shot at Iron; behind by a man wiiom
they passed on the road and was slightly
wounded. His daughter was more se
verely hurt, her life for a time being de
spaired of.
The witnesses in the caso begin their
- evidence at this point. F. de Jtfarais tells
this Rtory to the District Attorney : He
.says Schweizer met him one day and re
marked that he would "like to kill this
man Lehman." To this De Marais re
plied, jokingly:
"Well, I have a shotgun, if you'd like to
borrow it."
"A few days after this," continues De
Marais,- "one John Barker, who has since
died of poison, came to me, saying that
Schweizer told him that I had a shotgun.
He said I c wanted to borrow it to shoot
liovrs. T loaned him the gun and he went
away. That same evening Lehman was
jshotwith a shotgun. My gun was after
ward found in a gulch near the place.
Barker returned to me without the jÂ»un.
He called me to the back of tlie saloon
where we were and said to me:
" 'I have shot Lehman, and I threw your
gun in a ditch.'
" 'Why! what did you do that for?' I
said.
" 'Ho matter,' he said, 'here is a hat.
The San Francisco Call
Eoat After Eoat Got in Yesterday and in Consequence There Was a Glut in the Herring Market. The Run of Fish Was a Remarkably Gcod One, and Herrings
Were Sold at a Big Loss. Occasionally a Box Was Given Away at 25 Cents, and Yet Again Other Boxes Were Sold at Less Than Half a Cent a Pound.
Keep it and it will serve as a guarantee of
the vnlue of the gun.'
"He offered me an old hat, which I took.
"Barker then left the saloon. 1 '
De Marais says he took the hat some
days afterward to bis friend. Sam Ralston,
and told him to keen it as it micht be of
value to him thereafter. That is the end
i of De Marais' story.
Meantime there was a great deal of talk
about the mysterious shooting at Lehman.
Barker was arrested, the case was post
poned from day to day and finally he was
discharged for lack of evidence. Barker
was a ne'er-do-well, given to drinking,
carousing and the use of morphine.
I Shortly after his discharge he hired a
1 buggy, drove out of town and was found
dead from an overdose of morphine, the
donbt remaining still as to whether he
took it intentionally or through mistake.
Sam Ralston takes up the story here.
He says that he kept the hat in his pos
session for some time; thatDe Marais
came to him frequently to inquire about
it; tnet this aroused his interest in the bit
of wearing apparel and he began to make
inquiries; that finally de Marais told him
all that has been told here and that !
Lethen pat the hat in the safe in the
Fresno Savings and Loan building for
safekeeping.
Now De Marais takes np the story
again. He was a friend not only of Rals
ton but of Schweizer, as appears in the !
hitter's first approach to him. He at least
kept up the rfppearancs of this friendship, j
He told Schwetzer about his having re- I
ceived the bat from Barker and how he :
had subsequently turned it over to Rals- I
ton and that Ralston had it in his posses
sion and was interesting himself in the â 
circumstances attaching to it. The hat. |
it should be told here, is said to have been
identified by a number of persona as one
formerly worn by Mr. Schweizer.
When De Marais explained to Schweizer
all this about Ralston Schweizer, accord
ing to De Marais, made a direct proposi
tion to him to kill Ralston, saying that he
(Schweizer) would make it an object.
"I was so astonished," says De Marais,
"that I did not know just what to do.
'How could Ido such a thing? 1 haven't
even a pistol,' I said."
"'Oh,' said Schweizer, "if that is all
that stands in the way come here to-night
and I'll give you a pistol.' He went on to
argue with me. He said: 'You are the
very fellow to do it. You are on terms
with, him: you could be drinking in a
saloon and get into a quarrel and shoot
him in self-defense, or, if you prefer, you
could catch him on a dark road.'
'Welf," continues De Marais, "I went
away telling him I would be back in the
evening. I went at once to Ralston and
told him the whole thing. Detective Har
rison, a friend of Ralston's, had been told
much of this and had interested himself
in the matter. Ralston ana I saw him,
and they arranged to watch me and see if
they could what took place. Schweizer
had told me to come to the back door of
his shop and he would there give the gun
after dark. Instead of doing so I wept
into the shop. There were several persons
in the shop â customers â and Schweizer
frowned and motioned with his head, in- i
dicating that I should go around. I went
out. down a liitie ailey at the siJe of tho
shop, and pretty soon Sohweizer came out j
the back door of the shop and handed me i
a revolver and told me to mako good use i
of it. Harrison was concealed near by
and saw the transfer. I went away and
soon joined Ralston and Harrison. I
gave the gun to Ralston and ne kept it
until the next day. I then decided to go
back and see Schweizer to see what
he might have to say. Wo de
cided that 1 had better take the revolver
with me as he might ask for it. When I
went back Schweizer charged me with
having done nothing and demanded the
gun, and I ?a7e it back to him."
Thisenus De Maruis' second installment.
Ralston is said not to have relished the
idea of having men hired to shoot him.
He consulted with other friends and upon
their advice he visited the District Attor- }
ney ami to!d him all about it. Subse
quently De Marais and Harrison went be
fore the same official and told what is re
reiated here with even greater circum
stances and detail.
Among other bits of testimony it is re- j
ported that Mrs. Lemnan said, when in- j
formed of what was going lorwardâ aliat j
is in the District Attorney's officeâ that it j

BOARD A TRAIN
St. Louis and Kansas City
Express Captured by
Outlaws.

Cars From the Passenger

Driving the Trainmen
Back.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 23. â Trnln
I 49, the St. Louis and Kansas City Express,
was held up near Blue Cut to-night by
train-robbers. The train, in charge of
J Conductor Nichols and Engineer Mead,
I left here on time at 8:45 r. m. When the
i Missouri Pacific crossing, one aud a half
miles east of Independence, was reached
I at 9:25 o'clock, three men boarded the
I engine and compelled the engineer and
I firemen to descend. Tlie express and bag
page car were then uncoupled from the re
mainder of the train and the robbers
started eastward with the locomotive and
two cars. The express-car was in charge j
of Messenger Nichols.
When the train reached the Missouri
Pacific crossing a red light was swung
across the track, and when the train was
brought to a standstill the men covered
the engineer and fireman with guns. Con
ductor Nichols came forward with his lan
tern to see what the trouble waÂ«, when he
too was covered. He was asked to pass
over what funds he had, and be handed
one of the men $4. When asked if it was
company money he replied "No," and the
bandit handed him back $2, saying he
would make an even divide. Then he was
marched bacK and compelled to cut the
baggage and express cars loose from the
train.
Horace Matthews, gateman on the
train, and Rear-brakeman Rogers, started
down from the train to see what was the
trouble. They were ordered back. Some
of the* women on the train became
hysterical and hid their valuables, and
after the robbers had pulled out with the
engine and cars some were 'unable to find
where they had secreted them. The
Black Crook company was on board.
Express officials here say the run, so far
as money is concerned, was light, but they
have a heavy run of freight, the safe con
taining only three mail packages of jew
elry. The baggage car was numbered 13,
and contained the baggage of the Black
Crook Company, which recently stranded
in this city. When the train had parsed
Glenwood the express car was entered and
a few small packages were taken. The en
gine was then cut from the cars and run a
mile further on, where it was abandoned
and killed, and the robbers took to the
timber.
The "Blue Cut," as it is called, about
three miles from Kansas City, near Inde
pendence, has been thfl scene of several
hold-ups. It is here that the James
brothers in October of 1881 committed the
last of a series of similar crimes. "Bill"
R.yan, one of ihe gang, was convicted of
having taken part in it and was sentenced
to twenty-five years in the penitentiary.
"Bob" Ford, who afterward came into
prominence by shooting Jesse James, was
also a member of. the party. Both the
James boys are said to have been in the
affair although Frank has always con
tended that he had nothing to do with it.
Much plunder was secured and the rob
bery was conducted with that peculiar Bir I
of bravado so characteristic of the opera
tions of the pang. They went through the
cars, a man in advance holding an open
bag in which the passengers were politely
but firmly advised by another man with a
revolver to deposit what valuables they
had. One of them alternated his request
with quoting Scripture and at times des
canted facetiously upon the women being
treated with a most ceremonious polite
ness. Many of them, who were greatly
alarmed, were told to quiet themselves.
A vigorous pursuit was begun by the
authorities and railroad company, but it
was a long time before the real parties
were known, although the James boys
were always suspected of having been re
sponsible for it.
AT SEA WITHOUT FOOD.
Pitiable Plight of a Storm- Beaten Danish
Barkentine, Whose Captain Refuses
to Abandon Her.
NEW YORK, N. " '>ea 23.â The
Dutch oil-tank sdan.' \..-n:n. rhaven,
Captain Ninnes, which arrived this morn
ing from Antwerp in ballast, sighted the
Danish barkentine Solid of Hangesund,
on December 15 at 7p. m The barkentine
was burning a "flare-up" light and when
Captain Ninnes brought the steamer
within hailing distance, the captain of
the barkentine shouted that he was short
of breau and asked to be supplied. Cap
tain Ninnes told the barKentine's crew to
lower a boat, but the answer came back
that their bulwarks and boats were stove.
Accordingly, Third Officer Edward Born
haupt and a boat's crew lo'vered a life
boat and carried a supply of bread, beef
and potatoes to the Solid. On his return
to the steamer Bornhaupt said the bark
entine was in a bad plight. Her bulwark
was almost gone and the seas washed
across her d cks continually. Captain
Ystinas of the Solid refused to abandon
her. There were twelve men all told
aboard of her and they seemed to be in a
pitiable condition. Bornhaupt thought
her chances of living through a gale of
wind were but slight. Shortly after the
Bremerhaven's boat returned to her the
weather came on thick and the Solid was
lost to view; The Solid is an iron bark
entine of 340 tons burden, and was built
at Hamburg, In 1839.
SNOWSTORMS IN THE EAST.
Holiday Traffic Is Seriously Interrupted
in New York and Other Atlantic
Coast Cities.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 23.â Snow fell
at intervals throughout the day, making
street traffic difficult in the city and in
terfering considerably with railway busi
ness in the suburbs. Nearly all incoming
trams were behind schedule time and
those from the north and west report bad
drifts, owing to the high winds which
have prevailed. In Brooklyn and the
upper part of. this city there is good sleigh
ine for the first time this winter.
The street-cleaning department bad sev
eral thousand carts at work and the most
important streets were kept comparatively
clear. The storm caused a lull in the
holiday trade at ihe shops, and the de
livery systems and express companies,
whose facilities have been taxed to the
utmost by the heavy trade, were given an
opportunity to catch up.
In Jersey City the police were called,
upon to prevent fights between trolley
car employes who run sweepers over the
cartracks and piled the ,Â«now up in- front
of stores and merchants who put gangs
of men at work shoveling snow back upon
the tracks. Th - trolley companies finally
agreed to remove the snow and hostilities
were averted.
Reports from the interior of this State
and New England are that from ten to
fourteen inches of snow fell and the roads
are being operated with difficulty.
KENTUCKY VENDETTA ENDS.
Peace Restored in the Town of Mayfield
After the Lynching of Two
Citizens.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 23.â The re
ports of the race war at Mayfield have
been greatly exaggerated. There has
been no trouble since the killing of Wil
liam Suett (colored) early this morning.
Suett was only IS years of age. No fur
ther outbreak is apprehended, as the bet
ter class of people have determined to sup
press vengeance. This afternoon a mass
meeting was held at the Courthouse and
resolutions passed denouncing tho lynch
ing of George Finley and Jim Stone, the
killing of Will Suett and the burning of
property. At 9 o'clock to-night the town
was quiet, with a few guards patrolling
thH streets. Only about fifty men came
here from neighboring towns and these
have returned home.

EARL RUSSELL'S TRIBULATIONS.
Hi* Residence Burned, to the Ground by
Enemies.
. LONDON, Eng., Dec. 23.â The residence
of Earl Russell at Maidenhead, on the
Thames, was burned to the ground this
morning. The fire wtis undoubtedly of in
cendiary origin, as Earl Russell has recent
ly received menacing letters, some of them
threatening him with personal injury and
others threatening the burning of his
| property. There is no doubt that the fire
; is one of the results of the action for crim
â  inal libel brought by Earl Russell against
i his mother-in-law, Lady Scott, and
! others, which is now under adjournment
' because of the death of Frederick Kast,
i one of the defendants, and the illness of

LAUNCHING OF THE ANNAPOLIS.
The New Gunboat Christened by the Late
Admiral Porter's Granddaughter and
Successfully Floated.
ELIZABETHPORT, N. J., Dec. 31.â The
gunboat Annapolis was successfully
launched at 10:30 o'clock this morning at
the Crescent shipyard here. Miss Georgia
Porter, granddaughter of the late Admiral
Porter, christened the new addition to the
navy. The Annapolis, authorized by act
of Congress July 18, 1895, is the fourth of
the new additions to be launched, the
Vicksburp, Newport and Marietta having
already slipped off the ways.
The Annapolis' length over all is 200
feet and between perpendiculars 168 feet.
The mean draught is 12 feet, which ex
perts say is licht enough to permit her
navigating shallow waters, such as are
found ori the China coast and the rivers of
this country. Her engines will develop
800 horsepower and her contract speed is
twelve knots. Her main battery consists
of six 4- inch rapid-fire guns and a sec
ondary battery of four 6-pounders and
two 1-pounder rapid-fire euns. The new
vessel will have a complement of nine
officers, ten marines and 125 blue-jackets.

Falsifying.
WHITE SCORES THEM BY

Refutes Misstatements Made by
Corthell Before the Comm

ARGUMENTS OPENED FOR SAN
PEDRO.
Salt Lake's Chamber of Commerce
Declares for the Free
Harbor.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec, 23.â Con
sternation reigns in Huntington's harbor
camp here to-niglit. When the commis
sioners adjourned yesterday's session it
was understood from Engineer Hood, who
is supposed to have the Southern Pacific's
cohorts in charge, that only a few minutes
would be required this forenoon for th -.
introduction of some purely disinterested
testimony regarding Port Los Angeles as
a favorite harbor among seamen. It de
veloped during the examination that all
of these sea captains who made state
ments, with the exception of Alexander
of the steamer Santa Rosa, had, to employ
the considerate and graceful language of
Engineer Corthell, been "retained" by
Mr. Huntington. Engineer Hood aasureil
the board that Captain Alexander was not
partial to either side, but had come at
"our" request. In order to forestall any
questions or guesswork as to Captain
Pillabury of the Southern Pacific coll:er
Mineola, Hood explained that there was
no doubt of the lact that this astute sea
man was in "our" service. This is one of
the few instances where Mr. Hood was
absolutely certain about anything.
Captain Alexander proved a most un
satisfactory witness for Huntington. Like
Captain Dornfield yesterday, he disproved
every statement respecting destrucfiva
southeaster?; in Port San Pedro. Alexan
der and Dornfield agree that the heaviest
winds at both places were from "sou'-sou'
west." Ex-Senator Cole's discomntura
was apparent while Captain Alexander
was answering questions from different
members of the board.
Alexander began by saying that he had
been in charge of various vessels up and
down this coast for twenty-three years.
When asked about Port Los Angeie3, he
said that he had made about 300 landings
at Huntington's wLart, and had always
succeeded fairly well in discharging pas
sengers and freight â "but, of course,' 1 said
Alexander, '"it is not like San Diego. One
time my lines parted, and I was delayed
more than once, perhaps, in receiving
freight."
As to San Pedro, the same was true,
except that vessels like the Santa Rosa
anchor at the latter place. He had al
ways found holding Baffiefont in the outer,
harbor at San Pedro. When asked to
compare the different ports he Baid that
Santa Barbara was the best and safest at
all times. In thirteen years he had never
failed to make a landing there. Port Har
ford was eood, too, but he had been com
pelled a few times to pass that port by on
account of rough seas â never Santa Bar
bara or Port Los Angeles. As to Redondo,
he had been compelled to pass that port a
few times only, and then on account of
west winds. A stifled titter went around
the room when Captain Alexander uas
asked where he would have built a wharf
along this southern coast. His suggestive
reply was, "Where I had the most in
terest."
Captain Johnson of the steamer Whites
boro, a lumber carrier, was the next wit
ness. He had landed some twelve times
at Port Los Angeles and had never ex
perienced any accident. He had landed a
half dozen times at San Pedro. His ves
sel is of 145 tons and draws thirteen and a
half feet loaded. It carries principally
railroad ties for the Southern Pacific. He
had never experienced currents at Port
Los Angeles.
Mr. Hood here announced that two
other captains, not in the railroad em
ploy, were not on hand, and he would not
hereafter expect to present their testi
mony.
Captain Pillsbury, the next witness, sa|Â£
his marine experience on the Pacific Coatt
covered a period of four years. He had
never bad any trouble landing at the
Huntington wharf. On November 25 last
there was a heavy gale in Santa Earbari
Channel, but the landing was made in ex
cellent shape. Ho bad never landed a

twenly-hve feet of water. He would al
ways want at least five feet of water under
him wheu he sought a landing. The cur
rent lit Port Los Aneeles was heavier than
whs the swell at the Oakland pier. He
Jrequently anchored at Port Los Angeles,
using thirty fathoms of cnain.
This closed the introduction of testi
mony from Huntington's "retained" wit
nesses. When this announcement was
made by Hood, the board signified its de
sire to have some additional lieht from the
engineer.
In answer to a question, Hood said that
he saw no reason why the tunnel to and
from tidewater at Santa Monica should
have ever been made a part of the present
controversy, as tlie work could be easily
duplicated, to the northward specially, by
any railroad seeking to obtain Urn use of
tracks to and from the sea. If he had
money enough to build a railroad from
Salt Lake to Port Los Angeles he should
not care to come down Santa Monica
Canyon, with which gratuitous fling Hood
sought to bow himself to his seat. The
members of the board, however, persisted
in further questioning and finally brought
out the fact that any fills which the rail
road might make in the canyon lands
would go to the riparian owner, and that
the riparian owner happens to be the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company.
Admiral Walker now asked if there was
any one in the hall who wished to speak
for Santa Monica. Judge R. M. Widney,
in reply, arose and asked permission to
say something in favor of Santa Monica,
after the case for San Pedro had been sub
mitted. The board decided that both
sides would be permitted to sum up, each
for itself, as soon as all of the evidence
was in.
The announcement to those in the room
had no sooner been made by President
Walker than Captain John Cross arose
from his seat and made a heated argu
ment â as a cit'zen, he said, having no
particular interest t-.i stake â for Santa
Monica. His remarks were greeted with !
energetic hisses, interspersed with hand- !
ciapping. Admiral Walker to
clear the room if these demonstrations i
were repeated. No one else volunteered j
to assist Mr. Huntington's private harbor
scheme, and Hood announced the close of
"our" side.
The president of the board then stated j
that the way was open for the adherents
of s?an Pedro to begin their case. Necks j
in the rear of the room were.craned as j
John F. Francis arose from a front seat i
and, addressing the boar>l, stated that as j
president of the Free Harbor L'-azue he
would name the speakers and witnesos for
the people's free harbor at San Pedro.
The league's position in the matter, ex- \
piaineJ President Francis, was the lesult j
of a careful consideration of all the facts ;
in the case, witn an eye singly to the best
interact of '.he whole people. With this j
Mr. F-inc:s introduced the eminent engi
neer. Henry Hawgood.
Now came the first sensation of the
hearir.g.| The darcy in| Huntington's
woodDiie be_an to make his appearance.
Hia dimensions astonished the spectators, ;
accustomed as most of them are, at the i
almost constant subterfuges, misrepresen
tations ana forgeries which have charac- â 
terized -Huntington's end of this fight \
JroTii the beginning.
According to Engineer Corthell in his
opening statement on Monday the words j
'â¢deep-water harbor " were used in the act
lor the purpose of excluding any consid
eratijn of the inner harbor at San Pedro.
"It the board should locate the deep
water harbor at San Pedro," said Corthell,
"Congress expressed itself as unwilling to
consider tne local coastwise traffic of i
euougu importance to justify makinz tbe |
channel provided lor in ttie Wilmington i
harbor hem, considering tnat improved, to I
the present extent, it will answer the pur- j
â  >if ihe ordinary trade of the Pacific '
Coast."
In addition to reading from various j
speeches of Senator Frye, the engineer I
read from what he designated as a private |
letter from the same source. The general i
tenor of these extract* was that the cbject j
of Congress was to create a great commer
cial harbor, and that Wilmington (Port '
Sar. Pedro) would do very well for local '
commerce, but thnt for tue great ocean
traffic of the Pacific this port wouid be ut- j
terly inadequate, and could not be made a \
suitable deep-sea commercial harbor. It i
v, as further stated that in case the deep-!
water harbor should be located at San j
Pedro tLe inner harbor would get' abso- (
luteiy nothing, and could expect nothing j
lor twenty-frw years to come.
Instead of these things being true, ex- J
press provision is made in the act lor the ;
improvement of the inner harbor at Wil
mington, even in case the deep-water har- j
bor is located at San Pedro, and the sum !
of $50,000 is unconditionally reserved for j
beginning the work.
A telegram waÂ» sent on Monday even- j
ing to Senator White at Washington, in
fording him of tbe statements made by |
Corthell and of the letter from Senator !
Frye, purporting to express the wishes of j
the majority of tbe Senators and Repre- i
sentatives on the harbor question.
Hawgood's bombshell was Senator â 
White's reply. He read a tPiegram from j
Senator Waite, scoring Corthe;! and the;
whole Southern Pacific contingent for â 
thp-e false statements.
-ineer Hawgood then began reading
a typewritten presentation of the case on
tbe side of San Pedro. He quoted from
Gfnoral Craighili of t:ie former locating
board to siiow that San Pedro, from a
military standpoint, was the place for the i
harbor. The Santa Monica long .wnarf ,
was so far from shore that shipcbandlery, j
if needed in a hurry, couid hardly be se
cured by masters lying id that port. Tbe
speaker read a statistical statement to
prove that docks couid be built and main
tained more cheaply at San Pedro than at I
Santa Monica, because there was a great
deal more land for the purpose at tbe
former place. The grades for railroad J
building were also much better.
Maps were filed showing the water line
at high tide at Santa Monica on October 8
last, and tending to prove that no road j
but the Southern Pacific could get in
there. At Santa Monica, the speaker de- j
clared, there could never be any facilities
lor drydocking or general repairing of
larse vessels.
The original wind records at Santa
Monica and San Pedro for six months I
past, taken by the local customs autbori- j
ties, were filed by Mr. Haw.ood, to the i
dis*dvantage of the former place. With j
westbound vessels San Pedro had the
weather gauge. It is also more free from
fogs.
The reading occupied nearly an hour.
At its conclusion there were "more maps!
and documents filed. Then Mr. H&w- '
good, replying to a question, said tba: in '
his view of the question, be would say j
that at SfÂ»n Pedro ihe outer harbor should I
be the harbor of refuge, and tbe inner j
harbor the harbor of commerce. He con- i
tern plated twenty- five feet of water at \
Dead Mans Island, and thought that was j
sufficient. Ships now going to Santa j
Monica with over thirty leet draught
could land in the San Pedro outer harbor, j
Mr. Hawgood's paper was severely tech
nical, but covered the whole ground for
San Pedro in a most admirable manner.
At the conclusion of its reading, and
after Mr. Hawgood bad made several ex
planations for tne information of tbe
board, Hon. Charles O. Whitmoreof Salt
Lake, representing the Chamber of Com
merce there, was introduced.
Mr. Wbnmore presented a set of reso
lutions adopted recently by the Salt Lake
Chamber, setting forth the fact that, in
view of tbe pronosed buiiding of the Salt
Lake and Los Angeles Railroad, the oeo
ple of Utah had great interest in the loca- j
tion of the proposed harbor. If located at
San Pedro, the resolutions say, it will
make the building of the road a certainty.
The selection of San Pedro was of th*
greatest importance to all the people of
California, Utah, Nevada and Arizona.
Al; of the evidence so far presented for
Santa Monica, the speaker insisted, had,
with but one exception, been. given by em
ployes of tbe Southern Pacific or allied
corporations, while the advocates of Sa*h
Pedro were the people of all of the States
of the Middle West. Tnis latter fact he
intended to prove, it being exemplified by
tbe resolutions adopted by the trans-Mis
sissippi Congress held in St. Louis in 1894,
when twenty- six States were represen:ed.
"There is a fundamental principle of
law as well as economy," said Mr. Whit
more, "to tbe effect that in the expendi
ture of public funds It is the duty of the
servants of the people, in whom the trust
is reposed, to so use the fund a3 to insure
the greatest good to the greatest number."
His conclusion was that if the commis
sion selected San Pedro it would subserve
those ends, while to name Santa Monica
would enhance the interest of a single cor
poration.
"This contest,'' said Mr. Whitmore, "is
a battle waeed by the people on one side
for San Pedro against the Southern Pacific
corporation for Santa Monica."
Continuing Mr. Whitmore said: "Utah
is interested in the selection of this har
bor site because the people of the State are
engaged in an effort to build a line of rail
way between Salt Lake City and Los
Angeles, which, when completed, will
form part of a transcontinental system
and be the snortast line between the At
lantic and Pacific oceacs."
The friends of the free harbor will con
tinue to present their side of the case to
morrow.

TILDEN WILL DECISION.
Trusts Created for Public Libraries Are
Declared Invalid by a New York
Supreme Justice.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 23.â Justice
Beekman in the Supreme Court has
handed down a decision arising out of an
action brought by the executors of the will
of the late Samuel J. Tilden for a construc
tion of certain clauses in the will, in which
he holds that further trusts created by the
estate are invalid.
After the decision that the residuary
trust was illegal by the Court of Appeals,
and after Mrs. Pelton, the testator's sister,
had given mo3t of her share to the found
ing of the library in this city, a contingent
fund of $500,000 was created to carry out
clauses, 33 and 34 of the will, with respect
to the establishment of free libraries at
New Lebanon and Yonkers, $100,000 having
been left for each of these purposes.
Justice Beekman says that both of these
trusts are open to the tatal objection tuat
they violate the statute against perpetui
ties. These attempted dispositions are,
therefore, void, and the plaintiffs rest un
der no duty with respect to iliem.
On the question as to whether the trus
tees have the riuht to change the invest
ment of the $100,000 bonds which the tes
tator left to Aliss Marie Ce'este Stauffer of
New Orleans, Justice Beekmau holds that
they have no such power.
In conclusion thecuurt says: "Mr. Til
den would undoubtedly nave acted differ
ently coulrt he have appreciated that his
scheme tor a large public library in tbis
city would have been defeated, but the
court cannot now undertake to devise a
sciienie which will supply tnÂ» deficiency
or make another will for Mr. Tilaen."
AFTER A WEEK OF REST.
Major McKinley Returns io Canton Full
of Health and Vigor and Re
ceives Many Visitors.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 23.â President
elect McKiniey wnh his wife; Miss Dun
can, his niece; Captain H. O. Heistand
and party, arrived in Canton in a private
car on the Pennsylvania Railroad at 10:21
to-day. Judge William R. Day of Canton,
Mr. McKmley's particular friend, was in
the party, having returned to Chicago last
nigut from Menominee, Wis., in time to
join the train at Chicago. Major McKin
ley was in the ruddiest good health and
good nature, and a fresh color in his
cheeks and the brighter flash of his eye
told of the many benefits which his visit
to Chicago and a week of rest and recrea
tion had given him.
From a political standpoint there is very
little to announce as the result of Major
McKin.ey's trip West. He and his wife
drove from me depot to his mother's
home, where they remained a short time.
At his home he found the library full ot
visitors, and during the afternoon and
evening he was kept very busy. Secretary
of State McFarland of lowa and C. A.
Atkinson of Lincoln. Nebr., were among
ti.e first callers. They discussed with the
major the question of asking Senator Alli
son to enter the Cabinet, and whether or
not be would accept such an offer. Ex-
Governor Prince of New Mexico was also
a caller. Senator Shoup of Idaho came to
discuss the local situation in Lis State,
an.i later in the evening Colonel Frederick
D. Grant of New York stopped with his
family. He is en route to Chicago to
spend Chriittcas. Ho said bis visit had
no political significance, and that as far as
New York is concerned he be ieved Cor
nelius N. Bi-s as a Cabinet officer wcuid
be acceptable to all section*. John A. Lo
gan Jr. of Youngstown pail a social call,
and Captain A. T. Wimberly, National
committeeman from Louisiana, arrived
late to-night.

JAPAN AND PERU.
Representatives to Meet and E*t*bli-h a
*etv Heciproelt't Trraty.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 23.â A Herald
special from Washington says: There is
to be a conference in Washington to-mor
row between the Japanese Minister, Toru
Hoshi, and the Peruvian Consul-General,
Frederico Bergmann, at which it is ex
pected that a new treaty of reciprocity
between Japan and Peru wilt' be ratified.
A treaty has been in operation between
the two countries for some years, and two
years ago a new treaty was agreed upon
and siened, but owing to disturbances in
the Government of Peru and unavoidable
delays which prevented the meeting of
the representatives of the countries, the
new treaty has never yet been ratified.
It is believed that the conference to
morrow will be a mere formality, and that
the ratification wilt be accomplished on
that day, as there is no occasion for
further discussion in regard to the articles.
T: treaty will not become operative
until July. 1899, and is almost identical
with the new treaty signed by represen
tatives of the United States and Japan in
March, 1895, which will become operative
in 1899.
While the relations between Fern and
Japan are not as yet very extensive, in
tercourse between tbe two countries is
increasing, and to meet the exigencies of
the changing conditions the Japanese
have been desirous, of effecting the new
and more comprehensive treaty. . wh,ich
contains provisions allowing commercial
relations and national and internal rela- I
tions in general.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1896.
BRYAN OPENS A
LECTURE TOUR
Warmly Received by the
People of Atlanta,
Georgia.
"The Ancient Landmarks" the
Subject Selected for His
Address.
Finds Good Results From the Late
Campaign, as It Has Snt People
to Thinking.
ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 23.-Hon. W. J.
Bryan opened his lecture tour here to
night at the Grand Opera-house before a
large audience. All day long he held an
almost continuous reception. Governor
Atkinson took him to the executive man
sion in the morning as his guest. At noon
the Young Men's Democratic League
tendered him a luncheon, and to-night
the Fulton Club entertained him. Among
the speakers at the luncheon was ex-
Secretary Hoke Smith.
Mr. Bryan was introduced to-night by^
Hal T.Lewis, the Georgian who nom
inated him at Chicago. The late nom
inee's reception was enthusiastic, the
audience cheering him loudly and long.
His subject was "The Ancient Land
marks." The subject was extremely con
servative. The address was a discussion
of the governmental question. Govern
ment, he said, is what the people make
itâ good or bad, as they dictate. They can
remedy any abuses if they seriously un
dertake to do so. Often they are indif
ferent. It has been said that the man ]
who neglects to take part in controlling |
government is worse than the men who j
govern badly.
Mr. Bryan quoted liberally from Jeffer
son and Jackson. He touched on the
leading issues of the recent campaign, but
in a non-partisan way. The aim, said he, j
oi advocates of different money systems is !
to secure that one which is best for the
greatest number of citizens. Men differ |
as to which system will accomplish that, i
but all agree that the system which will
give a unit of value of the least possible
fluctuations is the best. In the end the
people of this country, and eventually tbe
people of the world, will select that sys
tem under which the unit of value is the
most stable.
In reaching that decision selfishness
must be taken into account. Selfishness
is here to stay, but it is not wholly disad
vantageous, for It is the manifestation of
the instinct of self-preservation.
A government should not only avoid i
abuses, but should protect the weaker \
against the strong. A government sub
stitutes law for force and right for might.
Governments must restrain. Mr. Jeffer
son said that one of the most important
duties of government was to restrain one
set of citizens from injuring another. !
Trusts were denounced as a means of
doinÂ» nn injury to our fellow-cit : .zens.
Mr. Bjyan remarked tuat he did not
think any party openly defended trusts, i
They are permitted to exist because the â¢
people are indifferent. They could be i
abolished by legislation or by public opin- j
I ion. Newspapers form puolic opinion, â¢
but they are not to be expected to <io it |
all. Every individual citizen should exer- i
cisc his influence and take a position and {
let it be k :own. Public opinion is so po- j
tent that it can crush out any abuse, yen j
trusts or the use of money in politics. ,
The use of money by political parties is
the most pernicious influence in politics, â 
and the party is young indeed whici doe 3 !
not use money io advance fts ends, Hut
it should be remembered that if the use of ;
money is permitted the citizens will them- '
selves be plundered to recoup the expendi
tures.
Unjust legislation was treated at some
length. The speaker declared unjust :ax- '
ation to be larceny. It is taking money
from one man's pocket and putting it in â 
tbe oocKet of another man. The chief
cause of discontent in this country is
favoritism in one form or another under
the Government. This favoritism may be ,
manifested by unjust taxation in different j
forms.
Mr. Bryan found good results in the |
recent campaign. It set the people to !
thinking, a habit which they wiil keep
up. Jefferson said that public officials :
who are not watched are wolves. Mr.
Bryaa thinks that hereafter public officials
will be more closely watched. Good
government consists in jealousy and not !
confidence, Overconfidence encourages
abuse of confidence.
In concluding, the lecturer remarked
significantly that the Latin poets said we
; iatit trees the fruiti t of which we do not;
expect to pluck. We are laying the foun- j
dation now for those who come after us. '
A part of the foundation work was got !
under way in tbe recent campaign. The j
superstructure will be built later.
Mr. Bryan will leave here to-morrow j
morning, and he will go to Chicago,
whence he will no to his home in Lincoln. !
He has a series of lectures booked in
Texas. _____________
IMPRISONS HER SON-IN-LAW.
Lawyer Bleeker of Chicago Accused of
Purloining $24,000 In trusted to
His Care.
, CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 23.â Mrs. Kate A.
Johnson, widow of ex-Cook County Treas- j
urer W. K. Johnson, caused the arrest of !
her son-in-law, Harry L. Bleeker, an attor
ney in the First National Bank building, >
this afternoon, charging him with embez
zling $24,000. In default of $15,000 bail he
was taken to the County Jail, where ". be
will spend the night in a cell in comnany
with a prisoner named - Harris, who is
charged with murder. Bleeker came here
from Los Angeles, CaL, about five months
ago. Mrs. Johnson, who owns consider- i
able property in California, claims that j
she had given him at various times money !
aggregating $24,000 to pay off mortgages I
and settle other financial obligations in '
th* coast State. Until recently, she says, I
she did not know that these obligations j
bad not been discharged. It is now al
leged that Lawyer Bleaker lost the money
intrusted to him in irrigation investments
in the West. After causing the arrest of
Bleeker, Mr*. Johnson repented her do
ings and attempted to secure his release. -

The man and woman were arrested.
A search of their rooms on Thirty-ninth

IN THE HANDS OF HER FRIENDS.
Queen Li.iuokalani Vigorously Repudiates
Language Attributed to Her by
a Texas Reporter.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Dec. 23.â Ex-
Queen Liliuokalani arrived here this morn
ing on the Sunset Limited from San Fran
cisco. She was accompanied by her
agent, Joe Helebute, Mrs. Graham, her
personal companion, and a maid and two
children of Mrs. Graham. The ex-Queen
traveled as an ordinary passenger and did
not occupy a special car. Tne party djd
not stop, but proceeded to Wasnington by
the Louisville ana Nashville road as soon
as the transfer could be made.
The Queen vigorously repudiated the
interview which a reporter professed to
have had with her at Houston, Texas. As
she speaks excellent English, she had no
difficulty in making herself understood.
Sue said:' "It is all a mistake. I was
never spoken with at Houston. Can you
wonder at my diffidence in meeting news
paper men when they insist upon putting
words into my mouth I never uttered? I
am sure you will appreciate my position.
I am notning but a deposed Queen. I
cannot talk about my country or its
future for fear that what I might say will
!be distorted. I have lived since the revo
lution in absolute retirement and have
taken little heed of public matters. What
my future movements may be is some
thin? that 1 cannot now declare, for I do
not know. I am in the iisnds of my
friends. lam going to Boston to meet
tne relatives of ray late husband and do
not know whether" I shall go to Europe or
not. Everything depends upon what my
friends decide."
A DASTARDLY DEED.
By a Miracle a Passenger Train Escapes:
, Annihilation.
BIRMINGHAM. Ala., Dec. 23.â Some
miscreants, intent on robbery, removed
plates from the rails on top of McComb's
trestle, fifteen miles east of here, last
night on the Southern railroad and
moved a rail twelve inches out of place.
Train No. 37, consisting of an engine and
six cars, with more than 100 passengers
on board, came down the mountain onto
the bridge at schedule rate. Engineer
Jim Hawes discovered the rail oat of place,
reversed and put on the air, but too late
to prevent the entire train and engine
leaving the track.
The train went its full length and ten
feet on the timbers on the top ot the
trestle, but fortunately did not turn over.
Had it not been for tbe move of the en
gineer the train would have dropped
ninety feet and not a soul have
escaped. The work was done by train
robbers.
Sheriff Oberlin and a possee with 6ix
good dogs are at the wreck and have
struck a hot trail and are now in pursuit
of the would-be robbers.
The passengers were transferred from
their perilous height to the ground and
brought here at 3 o'clock. The tra.n was
due here at 19:10 p. m. The passengers
were loud in praise of Engineer Hawes.
CALIFORNIA LEADS.
What the Annual Statement of Railroad
Construction bhour*.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 23- The annual
statement of railroad construction to be
published by the. Railway Age this week
will show th*VduVhig 1896 only 1802 miles
of lines were built in the United States,
the smallest mileage in any year since
1875. The number of lines on which this
track was laid is 163 â eleven less than the
number of new lines added in the previous
year.
Track was laid in thirty-eight of the
States and Territories. California had^67
nv.le-t on i eight lines Louisiana 154 miles
on five lines, Michigan 146 on eleven lines,
Georgia ninety-seven miles on fourteen
lines. Pennsylvania ninety miles on fifteen
lines, Wisconsin eighty-six miles on seven
lines, and Texas eighty-three on eight
line-.
Many railway enterprises were under
way early in the year which would have
added hundreds of miles of track but were
stopped by the financial agitation preced
ing election. Tne building of fully 2500
miles would have been the record for 1896
but for the political uncertainty.
NO TRACE OF POISON.
Result of the Analyst* of frank Ar-
buckle's Motnarh.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 23.â Coroner
Tuthill announced to-day that he had
received a final report from Professor
R. A- Wittbaus, who analyzed the con
tents of the stomach of Frank P. Artoickie
of Denver, who was found unconscious at
One Hundred and Fifty-second street and
Eighth avenue a month ago, dying soon
afterward. His overcoat and jewelry had
been stolen, though there were no marks
of violence on tue body. The analysis,
whicn was an exhaustive oue, showed no
traces of poison whatever. Coroner Tut
hill has concluded, therefore, that deatn
was due to heart disease, as indicated by
tbe autopsy. The formal inquest will
probably be held next Tuesday.

RECOGNIZED BY
THE PRESIDENT
Central America's Greater
Republic Taken by the
Hand.
Cordial Greeting to ths Envoy
of the New United
States.
Hope Expressed That Costa Rica and
Guatemala Will Soon Join
the Union
WASHINGTON, D. C, lsec. 23.âPresi
dent Cleveland to-day formally recognized
the new Greater Republic of Central
America, composed of Salvador, Nicaragua
and Honduras, by receiving tne envoy of
the new Government, J. D. Rodriguez.
After presenting his credentials the Min
ister made a few brief remarks suitable to
the occasion, to which the President in
reply said:
"I take pleasure in recognizing, in the
name of the United States of America, tbe
Greater Republic of Central America, and
in entering into diplomatic relations
therewith. Such recognition is given and
such relations entered upon in the dis
tinct understanding that the responsibil
ity of each of those republics to thÂ« United
States of America remains wholly unaf
fected.
"I discern in the articles of association
from which the D;et derives its powers a
step toward a closer union of Central
American states in the interest of their
common defense and general welfare, and
I welcome it as the precursor of other
steps to be taken in the same direction
an 1 which it is hoped may eventually
result In the consolidation of all the States
of Central America as one nation for all
the purposes of foreign relations and in
tercourses.
"To you I extend a cordial greeting,
both personal and official, and I trust that
your renewed residence at the capital of
this country ariil be as agreeable in its
personal relations 83 I believe it will be
useful and profitable foi the countries yon
represent, between each of which and the
United States has always existed and it is
hoped will always exist the closest ties of
friend-i' ip."
The President expressed the hope that
the new republic would soon include
Costa Rica and Guatemaln.
CATTLE QUARANTINE DISCUSSED.
Secretary Morton and the Canadian Min
ister of Agriculture Reach an
Understanding.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 23.-Hon.
Sidney Fisher, Minister of Agriculture for
tl.e Dominion of Canada, and Duncan Me-
Eacham, who have been in Washington
during the past week on official business,
left for Montreal ihis afternoon. Just be
fore their departure, Mr. Fisher had a
conference with Secretary Morton of the
Agricultural Department upon the matter
which they have been discussing in the
course oi Mr. F;sher's stay here. To a re
porter of the United Associated Presses,
Mr. Fisher expressed himself as very well
satisfied with the result of his visit.
"The agreement which Secretary Mor
ton and 1 have reached," said he, "for the
modification of the quarantine restric
tions imposed by the novernments of the
two countries upon the shipment of cattle
through each other's domain will have to
be first submitted by me to the Council of
Ministers in Ottawa before it can be pro
mulgated or its provisions made public.
In our spheres we as Ministers are not so
independent as our young secretaries.
The entire body of tbe council must pass
upon and approve the details of an ex
ecutive order before it can be made effec
tive."
"Does the agreement cover the matter
of transportation of cattle into or through
the other country for tbe foreign trade as
weli as the quarantine regulations?" was
asked.
"No, it does not," Mr. Fisher replied.
"That is a matter of local policy and sub
ject to legislative action and 1 do not care
to discuss it, but refer you to Secretary
Morton for any information regarding it.
Tbe occasion for the agreement that we
have reached grew out of the changed
conditions that exist now. When pleuro
pneumonia affl cted the cattle of the
United States and Canada both countries
established strict quarantine regulations
in the interest of the health of both.
These have remained in forre while the
disease has entirely disappeared, and they
proved a squrce" of irritation to the
shippers of each. It was difficult and
seemed impossible to change them by
correspondence, and it occurred to me
that a mutually satisfactory agreement by
a conference face to face, and the issue of
of the conferences between Secretary Mor
ton and myself has proved that I was
right"
KITTERY NAVY-YARD PROTEST.
Complaint That It Is Overlooked by the
Itepartmeut-
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 23.â Hon.
Frank Jones, with Senators Chandler and
Gallinger and. Representative Batter of
New Hampshire, protested to acting Sec
retary McAdoo this morning against the
apatny shown by the Navy Department to
ward the Kittery Navy-yard, and es
pecially against tbe neglect of the facili
ties of that yard for repair purposes. An
urgent demand was made that the dry
dock there should be improved with
money appropriated by Congress. They
were promised that special attention
would be given to the matter, ana it was
explained that the department baa been
compelled to use all available funds for
other work, sod thers was great doubt
whether tbe Kittery dock was of sufficient
dimensions to contain the smaller gun
boats.
REFORMS IN MADAGASCAR.
Slavery to Be Abolished and All Inhabi-
tants to He declared trrtt.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec 23â Among
the earliest reforms of the French Govern
ment in Madagascar is a decree abolishing
slavery, a copy of which has reached the
State Department from Consul Wetter at
Tamatave. It declares all the inhabitants
free, forbids traffic in human brings, nulli
fies every contract providing for the sale
of persons ana imposes penalties for viola
tions of the law. which are to be tripled
in case of a second offense. Other features
of the decree are that France promises not
to impose upon tbe people of Madagascar
any jextraordinarv war tax, and offers aid
to dispossessed owners of slaves in the form
of territorial possession. Another decree,
relating to schools, prohibits interference
by teachers in political affairs and urges
instruction in the French language.
John L. Waller's Political Ambition.
WASHINGTON, D. *C., Dec. 23,-John
L. Waller of Kansas, who as ex-Consul of
the United States at Tamatave, Madagas
car, and subsequently an mmjte ot a
French prison, became a subject of inser
national notoriety some months apo, is a
candidate for appointment as Recorder of
Deeds for the District of Columbia, an oi
rice which for some years past has been
filled by a colored man.
THE NEW TARIFF BILL
Programme for /(s Preparation Will Be
Strictly Carried Out â Dingley
Denies a Rumor.
WASHINGTON, D. *C, Dec. 23.â 1n
view of the apprehension which feems to
exist regarding the hearings which the
Ways and Means Committee will give be
fore the work of preparine the tariff bill
begins, the United Associated Presses is
requested to announce that the programme
agreed upon will be strictly adhered to.
When hearings on convention of sched
ules are limited to one day's time, they
will be granted. The bearings will begin
at 10 o'clock in the morning and will be
continued until evening, but no longer.
The committee requests, where the repre
sentatives of a number of interests desire
to be hearJ, that it would be better to
agree upon one or two persons to state
their case fully to the committee rather
than spend tbe day in bearing a number
of experts discuss the same subject.
It is stated that as equÂ«ily good an ef
fect car. be obtained by placing arguments
in writing instead of delivering tnem or
ally as the oral arguments will b? steno
grapuically reported and printed for the
information of the members. It may be
again stated that the hearings will begin
on Monday, the 28ih inst., and close on
January li.
The attention of Chairman Dingley of
the Ways and Means Coiumitiee having
been called to a dispatch stating that the
"Eastern members of the^Waysand Means
Committee, led by Chairman" Dingley, are
not disposed to took with favor upon reci
procity in framing the new tar.ff," he
said: "There is uot the slightest founda
tion for tbis statement so far as I know
and believe. While the matter has only
been slightly discussed yet I have not rfb
served any material difference of opinion.
On the contrary, all the Republican mem
bers of tbe committee are in favor of going
as the McKiniey tariff did on the subject
and further if practicable."

OF MACEO'S DEATH
Says It Was the Work of
Traitors in His
Camp.
Dercnbss His Own Great Grief
Over the Loss of H s
Chief.
Fell a Victim of Political Conspira
tors, Who Were Bought With
Spanish Go d.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 23.â Dr. Max
imo Zertucba, during the life of General
Antouio Maceo attached to his staff as a
surgeon, and after the death of Maceo ac
cused of causing his betrayal into the
hands of the Spanish troops, has written a
letter to the Hera'd, in which he describes
the death of General Maceo and the causes
leading up to it as follows, with the pref
ace that he owes it to himself to state how
the event happened:
Meline del Sur, Cuba, Dec. 23.
Major-General Antonio ilaceo at 8 o'clock,
Dc-cember 8, accompanied by part of his gen
eral staff, namely, Generals Miro and Diaz,
Colonels Nodaraze and Go-don, Maiors I'ieara,
Juztis, A hii ma da an( j Penaivlr, Captain Sau
vanel and myself, as surgeon of headquarters
general, four orderlies and Lieutenant
Francisco Gomez Toro, crossed the military
line between Mariel and Stajana at the former
point. At9o'cloct the following morning we
joined som- twenty-five cavalrymen be'.onging
to Coionel Sartorious' command at Mosquitos.
On the 6tn we started toward Baracora.
l>ur:ng the march some eight men of Lieu
tenant-Colonel Marieo's command were incor
porated in our ranks. Together we went at 9
o'clock that night to the grazing farm vPo
trero) of San Pedro, between Kincon and Go
vea. There we met trie forces under Urigaaier
Sanchez and Colonel Delgndo. numbering some
400 men, all cavalry. It was 2 o'clock in the
afternoon of the next day when word came to
our camp that the enemy's t'orces were moving
in our direction, following the trail. We pre
pared for the engagement.
The left flank was commanded by General
of Division Pedro Diaz; the right was under
the command of Colonel Delgado and Lieu
tenant-Colonel Acosta. Brigadier Sanchez
took command of the; center.
The tight 'vas under wav when General
Maceo, accompanied by Brigadier Miro, his
adjutants and myself started toward the
battielield. General Maceo moved forward to
within 500 pac*s of a stone fence, behind
which the-enemy's infantry was intrenched.
Brigadier Miro was to the right and I to the
left of General Maceo. He raised his sword,
and saying to Brigadier Miro,"This goes well,"
fell as if struck by lightning from the hor?e he
was riding to the ground. A Mauser bullet
had entered the right side of the chin, causing
a fracture of the lower jaw in three places,
coming out of the left lateral side at the b*se
of the neck. The bullet in its course tore the
carotid artery, bringing on a mortal hem
orrhage which caused death in a minute.
The moment General Maceo was wounded I
called for assistance. A trooper came to my
aid. He helped me, with great bravery under
severe fire, to raise the body of my general.
The trooper was at that moment wounded in
tee thigh. Bullets were pouring qver my
head and I remained intrenched behind the
general's horse, by the side of his body.
At that moment I saw the soa of Major-
Genernl Maximo Gomel before me. He had
been wounded in the lleti t shoulder during an
engagement we hai on December 3 between
(.'ayajabos and Colamos. His arm was in a
shng. We raised the body of Maceo and
placed it itpon the horse. He took hold of the
horse's bridle, while I held the general by the
feet. Then we started toward a gate, which
was the outlet to the inclosure we wÂ«re in.
Gomez was then struck by a bullet. He
sank to the ground. I went to his assistance
and General Maceo's body fell from the horse.
I begged Gomez to let me carry him on
horseback out of that place. Xothing would
avail to persuade. He would reply to every
appeal: "Let tne general be carried out first.
Then I will go."
Then, almost crazed, I ralloped on the gen
eral's horse toward our forces, which, owing
to the incidents of the engagement, were at a
long distance away. I met the brave and
honest Diaz. Hearing what I had t<> BRy to
him and hastening to do his duty was the
work of an instant. The enemy had advanced ;
it was necessary to dislodge him, and then we
recovered the bodies of Maceo and Lieutenant
Gomez. Had the latter died from the wounds
he had received in the chest and arms? No,
he was stabbed over the left s:de, near tho
breast. He had over his forehead also a ma
chete wound which had divided his stull.
Their bodies had been stripped of their
shoes, stocking*, side arms and jewelry.
At 7 o'clock that night the bodies were taken
to a shed on the grazing farm, and there I ap
peared before the commanding officers, who
were ignorant of General Maceo's death. An
affidavit of what took place wus drawn up
and sworn to, and with other official docu
ments in the case was sent to General Maximo
Gomez.
Alter stating the facts as they occurred I
wish to speak about my humtle personality.
Who killed Antonio Sfaceo? Who killed;iose
Maceo? Was it the enemy's bullets at hi Gato
and San Pedro? No, I will say a thousand
times no. They were killed through the men
of the Council. They were killed through
those, who having received money from the
Spanish Government afterward demanded
piacei which did not belong to them in the
ranks of the revolution in whose behalf they
hnve done nothing, but they want to take
places at the first.
When we were out of ammunition, with no
supples at all, we followed the enemy's train
in search of a cartridge; when we had no
other hope or support than God, the Govern
ment Council, composed of Pina, Roloff and
others, were holding back the forces under
Jose Maceo and J. M. Rodriguez from coming
to our aid.
Why? Because of high political ra't'ves.
What were these reasons? Not to lend sup
port. To allow the enemy to capture the un
armed, ill and wounded mulatto, Maceo. I
have wept over the ileatn of him who was my
friend, my brother, rather than my claief. I
have heard from his lips desperate wjords ut
tered at the diMoyalty of his own people. To
whom he alluded, I do not know.
AFFAIRS ON THE ISLAND.
Retrial of John Saiiguilli/. an American
citiz*n f Concluded.
HAVANA, Cuba. Dec. 23.â retrial
Â§of Julio Sanguilly. the American citizen
charged with having conspired against
the Spanish authority, was continued to
day. Counsel for the defense-continued
his address commenced yesterday; his re
marks occupying nearly two hours. He
spoke in the same clear, incisive style in
which ho began, advancing argument
afier argument to prove the innocence of
bangoilly, whose release from custody he
â  requested upon the grounds that the evi
dence : brought out had not shown that
the prisoner was, guilty of the crime with
which he was charged. At the conclusion
of the argument for the defense the tri
bunal adjourned without announcing its
decision. Judgment -in the case will be
rendered at an early day in accordance with
the law.
. The Havana newspapers publish articles
expressing approval of the attitude
upon the Cuban question taken by Presi
dent Cleveland and Secietary of State
Olney, both of whom are highly praised
for their firm stand in the face of the
action of tie ForeigD Relations Commit
tee of the Senate.
General Hernandez Velasco and Colonel
San Martin are still carrying on operations
against the insurgents in and around the
hills near San Cbrisiobal, Pinar del Rio,
and several minor engagements have oc
curred, resulting in the capture by the
Government troops of ten prisoners.
Several rebel strongholds have been de
stroyed and a number of huts burned, and
the cuttle and provisions of the insurgents
have been captured. The officers report
that their operations have about cleared
the zone of rebels and .destroyed their re
sources.
The few Cubans in this city who have
been incredulous concerning the death of
General Antonio Maeeo are now con
vinced that he is really dead. There is
no longer any doubt that Zertucha
treacherously led Muceo into a trap which
had been prepared for him in advance.
New evidence is received daily that goes
to prove the fact that there was treachery.
Cirujeda, in a speech made to a party of
excursionists, went so far as to compli
ment Dr. Zertucua.
Cubans ure elated at the sentiment
against the Spaniards aroused in the
United States. There is a growing con
viction here that the situation is approach
ing a climax, and should the United
States adopt the resolution recoenizing
the independence of Cuba thousands
would at once throw their efforts with the
Cubans.
Intense excitement prevails here to
know what is happening in the United
States. Nothing is allowed to be printed,
but there are various rumors afloat as to
the action of the Senate committee. The
Government has ordered that the use of
all private cables be suspended. The only
news now received from the L'a;ted btates
is that contained in the newspapers.
It is now generally acknowledged by
the Spaninrds that if the United States
interferes it will result in the loss of Cuba
to Spain.
The indignation of the Spaniards toward
Weyler increases daily. The planters are
almost ready to take up arms because they
are not allowed' to grind their sugar-cane.
It is believed that orders have been given
tbe Spanish troop 3to burn thp fields of
the Americans and kill their cattle to pre
vent the continuance of their grinding.
It is known positively that the filibus
tering steamer Three Friends has landed
an expedition near Jaruco, on the north
ern coast oi the Havana province. It is
reported that Ralph D. Payne, a news
paper correspondent, who was on the
Three Friends, has Deen captured by the
Spaniards.
There are many rumors of severe en
counters, but nothing is allowed to be
printed and this is taken to indicate that
the Cubans are winning. It is said the
Cubans have completely routed Melguizo
in the Province of Havana. The air is
full of rumors, none of which can be con
firmed.
FOR A DESPERATS EFFORT.
Jfeyler and Hit Government Plan a
Viaarow t'Â«tnpai(/rÂ».
LONDON, Ens., Dec. 23.â The Standard
Will publish a Madrid dispatch giving the
outlines of the plan of campaign against
the insurgents in Cuba, which hay been
formulated by Captain-General Wevler
and the Spanish Government. The
Spanish advance into the province of Pinar
del Rio will be by a vigorous combined
movement of ten columns of Government
troops, comprising 30,000 men, with a view
to compelling the insurgents either to
surrender and lay down their arms or to
cross the trochainto the Havana Province.
When this plan shall have been carried
out in Pinar del Rio similar tactics will be
pursued in the Havana and Matanzas
province;.
If these plans are successfully carried
out before March next the Government
will inaugurate reforms In Porto Rico
which will be followed slowly by reforms
in Cuba, and the Cortes will be convoked
to sanction extensive concessions in th 9
administration of the affairs of the island.
The Daily News to-morrow will publish
a dispatch from Rome saying that the
Spanish Government has placed with a
factory at Brescia, in Italy, an order for a
larse number of cartridges. This order is
to be filled as expeditiously as possible.
The dispatch also says that work is being
pushed upon the four cruisers now in
course of construction for Spain.
SECRETARY Uf.lt KKRT IS EVASIVE.

in*/ Humor.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 23.-Secretary
of the Navy Herbert was at the Waldorf
to-day. When asked by a reporter of the
United Associated Presses if 'there was
any truth in the report from Washington
that at a meeting of high naval officials
held in that city on Friday last a plan of
campaign, offensive and defensive, in case
of a foreign war, was submitted and dis
cussed, he declined to commit himself.
He declared there was nothing 'signifi
cant in the meeting of the naval officers
and that meetings on their part were -of
frequent occurrence. Naval matters, he
said, seemed to attract more attention
now than heretofore. He asserted that
there was nothine extraordinary in plac

had been hi* aim ever since assuming

MONEY BROKERS
UNDER ARREST
Sequel to the Collapse of
the Illinois National
Bank.
A Concern That Was Squeezed
by a Calumet E'ectric
Bond Deal.
The Public Scare Practically Over
and Confidence Sterns to Hava
B- en Restored.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 23.â Charges and
counter charges in connection with the
management of the National Bank of
Illinois were made to-day and engrossed
the attention of the financial community
to the exclusion of the day's events sur
rounding the bis; National bank collapse.
The arrest of Bankers Dreyer and Ber
ber, the discharge of the receiver of the
Roseland Bank and the continuation of
the savings depositors' run on the Illinois
Trust and Savings Bank and the Hibernian
Banking Association were the principal
developments. The public scare is prac
tically over and a complete restoration of
confidence seems to have been effected.
By arrangement of the Police Depart
ment counsel for the defendants and Jus
tice of the Peace W. T. Hall, the accused
private bankers, Kdward S. Dryer and
Robert Berger, entered Justice Hall's
courtroom at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Detective Fay, who held the warrants
which F. E. Kennedy, a saloon-keeper
and depositor at Dreyer & Co.'s Bank, had
sworn to, announced that the men were
under arrest. Tne char c in each case is
that the bankers received a deposit of $153
at the close of business last Saturday,
knowing at the time that they were insol
vent. The defendants were accompanied
by Adolf Kraua, their lawyer, and Charles
H. Wack^r of the Wacker G Birk Brew-In.-
Company. The latter signed the bond of
the banters in the sum of $500 eaoh for
their appearance in Justice Hall's court
January 2.
Kennedy says he is acting for himself
only, but his action i 3 regarded as pre
mature and ill advised by those who be
lieve the Dreyer & Co. failure could not
be foreseen. In this connection Levy
Mayer, counsel for the National Bank of
Illinois and Dreyer & Berger, said to a re
porter of the United Associated Presses
this afternoon :
"Dreyer <Â£ Co. cleared through the Na
tional Bank of Illinois. At the close of
business Saturday afternoon there was
not the slightest doubt entertained by the
firm or even the shadow of a suggestion
that they would not go on as usual Mon
day morning. Without a clearance bank
they could not possibly open up. The
end of the National Hank of Illinois was
as sudden as it was amazing. As one of
its counsel I had not the slightest intima
tion that there was any suspicion against
ttie bank until late Saturday night.
Dreyer <fc Co. did not know until Saturday
that their clearing bank was in dancer.
Tney then took steps which resulted in
the receivership. The receiver has ail
their property. The great agitation at
present existing hai made some men pre
cipitate and hasty in their criticism of
their action and advice. When tne excit
ment has subsided and the examiner has
made a through investigation into the
estate, and then only, will people be in a
position to calmly pass judgment.
"The causes for the National Bank of Illi
nois' failure and its condition will no
doubt in due time be placed be'ore the
public. These Calumet Electric bonds,
which all of a sudden have dwindled into
?o insignificant an asset, have for some
years been coveted by some outsiders, and
the interest on the bonds has always been
promptly met."
The shortest bank receivership on re
cord, forty-eight hours, was that of John
H. Nichols, who was appointed receiver
Monday afternoon for Frederick Wier
sema, proprietor of the Roseland Savings
Bank of Roseland, which cleared
through the National Bank of Illinois.
The receiver appeared before Judge Han
ecy this afternoon and reported that there
were assets of $83,000 in cash and real es
tate and liabilities of $51,600. Sufficient
money had been raise.l to carry on the
business and the Judga discharged the re
ceiver. The bank will op.-n its doors to
morrow morn ins-
The runs on the Illinois Trust and Sav
ings and Hibernia banks continued to
day in lesser degree, and when the usual
closing hour arrived there was not enough
of a line at either bank to dignify the
scare as a run. No vestige of excitement
is expected after Christmas day. The of
ficers of the Illinois Trust were so con
fident that the run on their bank was nt
an end that they decided to remove all
restrictions and began pa3 r ing in full to alt
depositors in line.
At the Hibernia Bank the notice was
adhered to.
A staff of accountants in charge of an
expert was put to worÃ during the day at
the Dreyer & Co. and Wasmansdorff &
Heinemann banks, and next week are
port is expected which will give an in
telligent idea of tne condition of both
houses.
Vice - President Hammond, who is
charged wilh pulling the wool over the
eyes of the directors of the defunct Na
tional Bank, would not talk for publica
tion when seen to-day at his Evanston
home, but a friend, speaking for him.
said:
"W. A. Hammond is to be made the
scapegoat for the failure of the bank. He
is a broken man to-day, but is not any
more to blame for the amount of money
loaned on Calumet Electric security than
are the members of the finance committee
of the bank and its directors. It was nec
essary for the purpose of n man connected
witb the South Chicago City Railway and
an officer of one of the biggest banks in
Chicago to depreciate the Calumet road
stock, and to this end these two men ac
complished the wreck of the National
Bank of Illinois. Members of the finance
committee and directors of the failed bank
knew the lull amount of the Calumet
ioan and hoped to make individual for
tunes on the success of the venture. They
were given stock of the road and the pur
pose of the deal was to seli the property
and besides paying the bank loan make a
neat sum for the directors. There has
been a sharp contest between the General
Electric and South Chicago City Railway
companies to get control of the Calumet
bonds. The latter road will be worth
$5,000,000 in five years and the outsiders
who ruined the bank know it, but they
wanted to buy the bonds cheap."
W. R. Page, a director of the bank, said:
"I never saw on the book of applicants
for loans kept at the bank for that purpose
the name of the Calumet E lectric Railway
Company. The statement published
regarding Mr. Hammond's connection
with these queer transactions are all true.
The auditing committee of the directory
reiied largely on the representations
made by President Schneider and Mr.
Hammond and were deceived."
DEPOSITORS BE SECURED.
Report of the Receivers of the Bank of
JHinneaota.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Dpc. 23.â The ma
chinery for closing up the business of the
Bunk of Minnesota was set in motion this
afternoon by Judge Otis in the appoint
ment: of William H. Lightner and Frank
A. Seymour, cashier of the Merchants'
National Bank, its receivers. M. D. Ken
yon, public examiner, in his petition to
â¦he court stated that the assets of the
bank were $281,000 in real estate, $45,000
in cash and $1,675,000 in loans and dis
counts.
Some surprise was expressed over the
last item, as when the bank's last state
ment, October 6, was made the loans and
discounts were given as $2,300,000. The
public examiner has evidently given these
at wnat .he regards as their actual value.
The bank is indebted to the depositors in
the sum of $2,341,000, and its liabilities
over all assets are $340,000. As the capital
stock is $600,000 and every stockholder
liable to twice the amount of his stock it
is pretty certain tbat every depositor will
be paid nearly dollar for dollar.
Tnere was a short run on two small
State banks this morning, but both went
through the clearing-house all right and
declared themselves ready to meet any
demands. At Ortonville the Bank of
Ortonville had a run this morning because
of the fact that William Dawson Jr.,
cashier of the Bant of Minnesota, is its
vice-president. The bank had plenty of
funds and is in no danger of suspension.

STAMPEDE AT THE TREASURY.
Chase After a Colored Swindler Causes
â¢ Great Consternation Among the
Employes.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 23.-Offi
cials and employes of the Treasury De
pnrtment building turned out en mass.?
about 10 o'clock this morning, and for a
while great excitement existed over an
unfounded report of an attempt to n<b the
place where the Government keeps its
treasure. Rumors flew thick and fast, but
not so rapidly as the alleged robber and a
large number of pursuerg. The man w^s
overtaken at the corner of Fourteenth and
F' streets, a block from the Treasury build
ing, and escorted back there by a bie
crowd. After an investigation he was
turned over to the local police. The stoÂ»y
of the affair was this:
A well-dressed negro called on Assist
ant Secretary William E. Curtis at his
office in the department and said he was
authorized to collect $10 from Mr. Curtis
as a subscription for the charity ball. A
telephone message to a reference given
by the negro brought back the response
that he was all right. Mr. Curtis in
structed private Secretary Johnson to pay
the man the money, but Mr. Johnson be
came suspicious and suggested to the col
lector that they visit the captain of the
watch. The suggestion had an electric
like effect on the negro. He made a wild
leap down a stairway, followed by Mr.
Johnson and a number of others. News
of the chase spread through the big build
ine, and for short time much excitement
prevailed over rumors of robbery and
other thrilling suggestions.

Lavigne- McKeever Contest
at Long Island City
Declared Off
Puritan Club Fails to Put Up
the Purse Promised the
Winner.
Sports Who Paid Admission Declare
They Encountered a Bunko
Game.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 23.â 1n spite
of the fact that the Marlborough Athletic
Club had waded successfully through the
labyrinth of efforts to prevent the battle
between George (Kid) Layigne of Sagi
naw, Mich., and Charlie McKeever of
Philadelphia at the old Puritan Athletic
Club in Long Inland City to-night, in the
end the bout was declared off. t The man
agement was unable to put up the $2500
purse which was insisted on by the prin
cipals, and thn latter refused to go on in
consequence. There was only $500 in the
house. The thousand or so of disgruntled
sports who braved the snowstorm in their
eagerness to see the prominent light
weights filed out of the building fully con
vinced that the hoodoo which had fol
lowed the old Puritan Athletic Club, both
under that name and as the Eureka Ath
letic CluH was firmly settled to-nieht
when it made its debut as the "Marlbor
ough." It was announced that the bout
would be pulled off at the Greater New
York Athletic Club, at Coney Island, on
New Year's day, but the latter club has
not yet been granted a license.
There were hasty rumors set afloat by
the Law and Order Society that tne Marl
borough Athletic Club never intended to
pull off to-night's bout and that the fight
ers were simply used to draw people to the
club and the club pocketed the money. The
Law and Order Society stated that it had
furnished affidavits yesterday to Governor
Morton to that effect. It must be stated,
however, that Lavigne and McKeever
came to-night in good faith themselves
and simply asked that the money be put
up in order to protect theonselves. The
matter had a very ugly look on the face of
it and there is no doubt there was a bunko
game somewhere. At all events boxing
on Long Island has received a severe
blow.
An open bout of te.n rounds at 125
pounds between Mike Sears of Boston and
Frank Patterson of Brooklyn was put on
at 9:30 o'clock. Charley White was releree
and Harry Keo;Â»h timekeeper. Sears was
on the aggressive at the start and had a
good deal the best of the set-to, but the
referee called it a draw.
TOMMY RYAN WINS.

SYRACUSE, N. V., Dec 23.â Nearly
2000 people paid good money to see
Tommy Ryan put Billy Payne, the cham
pion welter-weight of Pennsylvania, to
sleep in four rounds before the Empire
Athletic Club in this city to-night. It
was only a question of time with Ryan.
Kor the first three rounds he did nothing
but feel for his opponent, and took some
savage blows in return. But after two
minutes and forty-rive seconds of hard
fighting in the fourth round he put a
half-swivel hook blow on Payne's jugular
vein, and the latter went to the floor un
conscious. It took nearly a minute to re
vive him.
A twelve-round preliminary bout be
tween Billy Moore of Syracuse and Jack
Sullivan or New Y r ork, feather-weights,
was one of the hardest scraps seen in
Syracuse this year. Moore got the de

STOCKING ENTERS
FOLSOM PRISON
The Forger and Perjurer
Recaptured Near
Stockton.
Officers Learn His Whereabouts
by Following Nellie
Riley.
Claims Hs Was Unassisted in His
Escape From Deputy
Degan. â¢
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 23.â Frank
L. Stocking, perjurer, straw bondsman,
ward politician and "dope fiend," who
last Iriday evening escaped in this city
from Deputy Sheriff Degan while en route
to Folsom State Prison to serve the State
for a period of ten years for perjury, has
been recaptured and landed in the peni
tentiary, aud the cloud of suspicion which
nad been slowly gathering over high places
in San Franc;sco has drifted away. Al
though the responsibility fcr his escape
has been fastened upon Neily Riley, lor
whom Stocking furnished straw bonds
and by swearing to them landed himself
behind the prison bars, and although it is
claimed that iv her gratitude to Stocking
this woman planned his release, there have
also been whisperings to the effect that
Nelly Riley was but an instrument in the
hands of others, and that during the past,
when Stocking did dusty politics, he
obtained a hold upon certain successful
politicians, who had a hand in the pie
when Stocking got away. Be that as it
may "the best laid plans of mice and men
gang aft aglee," and Deputy Sheriff Fitz
gerald has placed Stocking where he
rightly belongs.
Last Friday evening Deputy Sheriff
Degan arrived in Sacramento with
Stocking and another prisoner,, en
route to Folsom. He decided to
lodge tneru in the County Jail
until the train left the following morning
for Warden Aull's caravansary. Hand
cuffing his men together, he started up
through Chinatown, and on the way
Stocking produced a key, unlocked the
handcuffs,^dashed into a Chinese opium
den and disappeared.
As soon as the news of his escape
reached Sheriff Whelan he detailed Dep
uty Fitzgerald to take charge of the case,
and the latter, with the aid of the San
Francisco authorities, soon discovered
that Nelly Riiey, the woman in the case,
was on the point of leaving for Sacra
mento. He followed her and her male
companion, known as "Dutch Harry," to
this city, and, procuring the assistance of
Policemen Maiey and Fisher, soon located
the couple and kept them urfder constant
surveillance. The next day, according to
his story, he placed both under arrest, and
found in "Dutch Harry's" possession a let
ter from Stocking, addressed to his mother
at 2511 Gctavia street, requesting her to
send a steam launch to Stockton, and an
other letter to a certain person, requesting
that funcls and a disguise be forwarded
immediately to the ranch of a man named
Ray, a brother-in-law of Nelly Riley. who
resided between Acampo and Stockton.
Placing his two prisoners in close confine
ment, Fitzgerald returned to San Fran
cisco and had ail the plans carried out.
Tne launch started ior Stockton, con-
V- ying officers, with a white cloth bound
around the smokestack as a distinguish
ing mark. Fitzgerald then returned to
this city and dispatched Deomy Degan
and Policemen Maiey and Fisher to Ray's
ranch. The party arrived at Gait and there
engaged a Deputy Sher.ff as guide and
then drove to the Ray residence, arriving
some time after d&rJc
Stocking heard the carriage drive np
an-d remarked that his hiding-place bad
been discovered. He attempted to climb
out of a window, bnt save up the ide 1
â when ne saw Officer Fisher standing out-
Bide with a drawn revolver. In a short time
Stocking was in irons and on tne return
trip to Sacramento. The officers reached
here with their prisoner at 4 o'clock this
morning, and when the train lett for Fol
som a few hours later Stocking was on
board in custody of Dejran and Fitzgerald
and Officer Maiey.
After his recapture Stocking told the
officers that it had been his intention to
I- aye the farmer's house last evening, but
he finally concluded that be would wait
until this morning. He had told Farmer 1
Ray that he and a iriend had got into
trouble over a gambling game and that
the friend was about to be tried on a charge
of gambling. The friend would be ac
quitted if Stocking, who was wanted as a
witness, would keep away. Stocking told
the officers that it was his intention to go
to New York and lead an honest life. He
did not deny his guilt in having com
mitted perjury, but he believed the sen
tence was excessive. In his opinion two
years would have been sufficient. He had
perjured himself in order to save a friend.
Stocking said he himself had made the
key with which he had opened the hand
cuffs.
When he ran through the Chinese
opium den, he 'hid for a time on a rear
porch. Deputy Sheriff Degan passed ciose
to him when nÂ« was searcning for him. A
lew minutes later, Stocking says, he
climbed over a fence and made his way to
Second street, where he boarded a P-street
car and rode to Twelfth street. After go
ing to a station and telephoning to friends
in San Francisco to come to his rescue, he
went to a vacant bouse, where ha passed
the night in a basement, almost perishing
from the cold. The next day he procured
a buggy from a livery stable and drove to
the Ray ran en.
SHERIFF WHELAN'S CONNING.
How Be Procured Information From
Chinatown Opium " Fiends."
Sheriff Whelan did a clever bit of de
tective work in connection with the cap
ture of Frank Stocking, the forger who
escaped from a deputy at Sacramento.
He looked the ground over carefully when
word came that the criminal was at large
and knowing his associations in this City
concluded that his friends could be
"pumped" if properly handled. So the
Sheriff made a few changes in his ordina
rily natty business garb and took a trip
through the haunts of opium "fiends" and
the low characters with whom Stocking
traveled. v
He soon located a gang of the forger's
intimates and the use of a little money
loosened their tongues to *n extent that
gladdened the Sheriff's heart. After they
were properly primed the subject of Stock
ing's escape was brought up, and the
Sheriff took occasion to apeak admiringly
of his nerve ia making nis leap into the
cellar.
"Oh, he's all right," said a "fiend,"
"and he has fooled Whelan dead easy.
Kit Riley has gone with her friend to help
him out and he will never serve his ierni
atFolsom."
Sheriff Whelan had gained all the infor
mation that was to be had in that quarter,
but the tip about the Riley woman was
enough, and within a few moments his
deputies were apprised of the news. This
led to the watch on the forger's female
friend that finally led the officers to Stock
ing's hiding-place.
Tiie following is from a letter written by
Stocking to his parents after his escape,
and found by Deputy Sheriffs Fitzgerald
and Degan of San Francisco on the person
of Henry Verhellen, the companion of
Nellie Riley, at Sacramento. Through
*.hts communication Stocking was traced
and retaken:
Dear Mother: This will introduce to you
Mrs. Wingrove, who will tell you everything.
Trust her, my dear mother and father, it
was impossible for me to let you hear from
me any sooner, as I can trust no one. This
lady has been with me and lier husband from
the start. She knew I was going to get away,
and she and her husband followed me up on
the next train. She will tell you all ihet has
happened since I left San Francisco; alsowhere
I am now and also about the buggy ride we
had.
I am now with her friends and waiting for
transportation, and Harry must do just as he
is told to do. He must do everything just as
he is told and ask no questions, as I shall
have made all my plans and all my con
nections and if any one fail or miscarry all Is
lost. But If he does just as he is told to do, all
will be well and all my plaas will connect on
time.
But Harry must be on time and also do just
as he is tola. This is what ne is to do: Tues
day afternoon he must go down to the wharves
Â«lone and find b small gasoline launch and
rent it for Thursday to go to the City, .where I
shall take a steamer for New York at once.
Mrs. VVingrovo will tell you everything I
want done. This means my liberty. You
must tell Harry that he is not to talk to any
one or tell any one, not even his gin, if he
have one.
First see Charley and get his overcoat and
his Prince Alberi or cutaway coatâ no sack
coatâ and a vest and a stick of bli;ck cosmetic.
Do these things up in a bundle and send them
to Mrs. Wigmore by Charley's wife. No one
would ever suspect her, aud she need not
throw herself.
' These things must be rsady Tuesday after
noon for me to get Wednesday morning. I
will take the best ol care of them and reiurn
them to him Friday.
The next part Harry must attend to per
sonally. He must have the launch at the
exiict place no is told and must tie a while
rag on the exhaust pi^e so I can recognize it
without asking any one. 1 will doall the rest.
Mrs. Wigmore will give you directions iur
Harry, bui do not tell him what they are until
he Is ready to start at t> o'clock Thursday
morning.
Cheer up, my dear parents, as all is now
bright before me. Remember that I have only
one object now ana thiit is to work and get
some money for a pardon from that unjust
aud cruel sentence that is now a blot on my
life.
1 will see you and say a orief good-by before
the steamer leaves.
To Dear Brother Charles: I must not torgetmy
children in my troub.e and what little I ask
you can attend to. Send them all some nuts
aud candy and some little toy from papa and
picture books and a nice story book to Bertie,
fome lit lie toy or encine and cars for Toots â
that is what he asked me ior Fridayâ and a lit
tle doll for Freddie. Be sure and burn this up
as soon as possible.
Good-by, dear Charles, until I see you. I
wish you and all the folks and your children a
merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Brother Frank.
SANTA CLARA GROWERS ACT.
Will Petition the Ways and Means Com
mittee for a Duty on Green and
Drred Fruit.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec: 23.â A meeting of
fruit-growers and citizens will be held in
Judge Lorigan'n court room Saturday
afternoon, under a call issued by the
Board of Trade, to take action looking to
the imposing of a duty upon green and
dried fruit. Suitable resolutions will be
adopted and forwarded to the Ways and
Means Committee of the House of Repre
sentatives, which will give hearings upon
the subject of duties on fruits and frait
products about the Ist of January. The
meeting is called in accordance with a
suggestion made by Congressman Loud in
a letter received by the Board of Trade a
lew days ago.
President T. R. Weavers has named the
following as a committee to prepare suita
ble resolutions to be submitted to the
meeting: Ralph Hersey, Professor C. W.
Childs, J. H. Fiickinger, E. A. Wheeler,
E. E. Goodricn, E. F. Freita?, William
Wehner, W. \V. Turney and P. M.
Righter.
The iroDorrance of a revision of the
tariff on fruit aud wines may be esti
mated, as stated by a fruit man, through
the computatioii of a duty of even 1 cent a
pound based upon last season's crop,
which would mean about $350,000 upon
dried fruit alone, added to which a reason
able duty upon wines,; and this valley
would be the richer by nearly naif a
million dollars. The above being true of
the past season, the same authority de
clared that with a lull crop from ail the
trees now in bearing and in good vintage,
a tariff properly framed would mean not
less an increase in tue wealtn of this val
ley than $1,000,000.
Jell With a Scaffolding.

land, a painter, working at 242 South

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec. 23.â George
Hickey has obtained judgment in a Jus

for losses sustained in the handling of a
patent pie-lifter. Hickey purchased the
right of sale for Santa Cruz County under
agreement that the pie-litters should cost
at Portland, Or.. $5 per hundred. The
Portland hcuse made him pay $7 per hun

Hickey's retail price was only 50 cents he
could not afford to hoist pie at that figure,
hence the suit.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1896.
NATIONAL CITY
ASSASSINATION
Fruit Thieves Fire Upon
the Watchman in an
Orchard.
Charge of Shot Enters the Vic
tim's Back and Causes
Death.
He Had Attempted to Dnvj Away in
Their Wagon to Summ<n
Assistance.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 23.â An atro
cious murder was committed on Sixteenth
street, National City, after dark to-night,
at the Land and Town Company's or
chard. John Patterson, the watchman,
was the victim, and his assassin is un
known. Two men are supposed to be im
plicated. .
About 8 o'clock a young man named
Meade was* riding on a wheel along near
Tenth avenue, National City, when he
heard a cry lor help come from a man sit
ting in a wagon by tne roadside. He
weiu to bis assistance and found that the
man was dying. It was Patterson. Meade
held Patterson while others who were at
tracted by his shouts ran and got Coroner
Johnson, who lives not faraway. Patter
son waa almost gone, and before he could
answer a question from Meade he gave a
few gasps and died. His bod*' was re
moved to the undertaker's near by and
examined.
It was found that his entire left shoulder
and back was riddled with fine bird shot,
causing internal hemorrhage. The vehi
cle that he was in whjen found was then
examined. It was a light spring wagon,
drawn by a small dark bay horse. The
horse was sweating profusely, and had
probably run away with Patterson.
Tbe spot at which the dying man was
found was about two miles from the
orchard where he was shot. Tbe Land
and Town Company had missed a lot of
fruit from the orchard and determined to
place a watchman there to catch the
thieves. Patterson was hired by Al Cope
laud, the foreman, he being Copeland's
brother-in-law. This was his first night
at the orchard.
A hasty survey of the situation indi
cated that Patterson had seen thieves ap
proach the orchard and had hidden from
them. When they were inside gathering
oranges he jumped into the wagon and
tried to get to town with it to hold it .for
evidence. He was unarmed, and proba
bly did not care to tackle the two men.
They saw him driving away, and shot him
in the back. He either had strength lett
to drive to town or the horse took fright
and ran away with him, leaving the
thieves in doubt as to whether they had
killed him. The appearance of the wound
in the back showea that they were not far
distant ironi the victim. , â¢;/
, About, B:3o. to-night Sam Black, a for
mer . constable . and V the man who ! ; was
crippled by Chris Evens while trailing
that desperado, appeared at police head
quarters and said his horse and wagon
had been stolen by two men in Telegraph
Canyon, ten or, twelve miles southeast of
the city, beyond the orchard where the
shooting occurred. Black described his
rig. it was the one in which Patterson
had been killed. .He .said he had been
hunting and was temporarily away from
the rig, leaving his dog behind. He saw
two men get into it and drive rapidly
away. :; "},\ :V â¢
He chased them as far as he could, but
they drove too fast for him and got out of
sight. His gun was in the wagon and
they got away with everything, even his
hunting coat. He asked for help, to look
for the thieves. .
Deputy Sheriff W. J. Ward joined Black
and they left for National City an hour
after the murder was reported. In the
wagon was found the dog, the hunting
coat, a package ol tobacco and a number
of quail and rabbit. There were several
sacks such as orange thieveS would use.
The officers can do nothing until morn

POWER FOR SACRAMENTO.
Electric Current Transmitted Over the
K<*vc<i*tle JAne.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 23. -To-day
occurred the first transmission of the elec
tric current to this city ovor the new line
of the Central Electric Company. It was
a success. The company's power-house is
at Newcastle, thirty milts distant, the
rower being furnished trorn the reservoirs
of the South Y'uba Water Company.
Three high potential wires carry the cur
rent to the station in this city, which is
furnished with two motor* and two arc
light dynamos, which will run 120 arc
light*. Ii has also eight step-down trans
formers to reduce the voltage, and the
switchboard is furnished with several of
the latest improvements.
This morning a current of 15,000 volts
was turned on at Newcastle to test tub
line, and it was found to be in perfect or
der clear to this city. On Christmas night

Carton* AÂ»*ault Cane.
CARSON, New, Dec. 23.â T0-day was
the time set for the plea of District At
torney Charles A. Jones*, charged with as
sault on the person of Editor S. P. Davis
with brass knuckles, with intent to indict
bodily injury. The case was before Judge
Mack, and the defense stated that before
entering: a p.ea they wished to interpose
the objection that the District Court had
no jurisdiction. The trouble between
Jones and the Appeal editor occurred on
the block occupied by the Postoffice. Tne
reiords show that this block was deeded
to the United States, and the claim of the
defense is that the local courts have no
jurisdiction. Both counsel wanted time
to look up the matter, and the case was
continued until the first Monday in Jan
uary.
Kail Caiualty Aror Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 23. âA passenger

After the man was knockeil off the trestle
the cars came to a halt and he was piefced
up. He was still alive at the time, and
was taken on to Ldi, but died before
reaching that place. The man was about 60
years old. He carried a roll of blankets,
and was evidently a tramp.

THE VICTORIA INQUIRY.
Witness Contradicts Captain McLean Re-
garding the Price Brought by
the Favorite.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 23.â Before the
Bering Sea Claims Commission to-day
Theodore Lubbe, continuing his evidence
under cross-examination by Dickinson,
said he bad no interest in any of the
claims now before the commission. Pe
ters then put a question as to the price
the Favorite sold for, wanting, he said, to
show that it sold for $4500, and not for
$3000, as stated by Captain McLean.
Justice Putnam raided an objection to
the case being agaio opened on a question
of value. Peters said he did not see why
he should not show what price the
schooner was sold for. Putnam said the
Commissioners had some rights as to the
time taken up by the counsel. Peters
replied that the counsel also had rights
and it was within their rights to put the
claims in a satisfactory manner, j
Justice Putnam said he had the highest
regard for counsel on both sides, but there
were times when the best of counsel
needed checking. Peters admitted this,
but said that when counsel were checked
and held that they were right it was then
within their right to persist.
Captain McLean had been put forward
as an important witness, and in making a
statement of facts did not show the date
when the schooner was sold, although he
was interested in the sale and had
knowledge of it. He proposed, he said,
to show that the Favorite was valued at a
much higher price than Captain McLean
said. As that evidence was not only to
be used in the case of the Carolena, but
would also be made evidence in other
cases, he claimed the right to show
whether it was to be relied upon, and to
show tbe sales in which Captain McLean
was interested.
Dickinson considered that Captain Mc-
Lean's valuation was for 1886, and the
witness had stated he did not know of any
sale in 1886.
Justice Putnam finally withdrew his
objection. Lubbe, in reply to Peters'
question, said that in 1883, on the 14th of
November, a fourth interest in the Fa
vorite was sold to Captain McLean for
$1337,50, and in 1884, on December 10, it
was sold to Mr. Spring for $4500.
JAILED AT SANTA ROSA.
Capture of a Man Believed to Have Been
the Masked Outlaw Who Entered
a Bodega Store.
SANTA ROSA, Cal, Dec. 23.â Frank
Coleby was lodged in the County Jail here
to-day, charged with having been tbe
masked robber who made snch a bold at
tempt to nold up Mr. Goodman of tbe firm
of Goodman & Co. at Bodega last nignt.
It appears that the would-be robber was
armed with a shotgun, which was leveled
full at Mr. Goodman when the command,
"Hold up your hands and dig up your
money," was given.
The shotgun had no terrors for the in
trepid Bodegan, however, and instead of
"digging up" he made a rush for the in
truder, and succeeded in grasping him by
one hand. The gun was discharged in the
struggle which followed, and the twelve
big buckshot that lodged in the store wall
prove that the robber meant business
Meanwhile the burglar wts using his free
arm to batter the storekeeper in the face
and a staggering blow soon left him free
to escape in rhe darkness, leaving his gun,
hat and mask behind. A clattering of
hoofs in the direction of Sevastopol told
how and in what direction the fellow had
fled, and a po-'se, including one brave
young lady, soon gave chase. They were
unable to catch sigbt of the fugitive, and
the fact that a bareheaded man galloped
through Sebastopol at 9:30 o'clock proves
the robber to have been well mounted.
The gnn left by the outlaw was soon
identihed by several young men' as one
used by Frank Coleby of Occidental, and
as the constable of that burg was absent a
posse of citizens-, heade-i by Sam Stump,
arrested Coleby in his room at Robinson's
Hotel, Occidental, this morning. The
hotel people say that Coleby went to his
room at Jl o'clock by tbe back entrance.
The accused man was once tried for'burg
lary in this county, the jury disagreeing.
He protests his innocence, but will make
no statement in regard to his whereabouts
last night or the ownership of the gun.

SHOT TO DEATH
BY HIS PURSUERS
" Bunko Pete," a Notorious
Cowboy, Killed Near
Hagerman.
Opens Fire Upon a Party That
Threatened Him With
Lynching.
Was Making for the Mountains After
Wounding a Man in a Bar-
Room Brawl.
BOISE, Idaho, Dec. 23.â Harry Kline, a
sheepherder known over a large part of
this State as "Bunko Pete," and all-round
bad man, paid the penalty with his life
for the attempted murder of Marion Gar
ner at Hagerman to-day. During a brawl a
quarrel was commenced between Garner
and "Bunko Pete" in a saloon where the
crowd had been drinking. Suddenly
"Bunko Pete" whipped out a revolver and
shot Garner through the body, and it was
thought he bad killed Garner.
After tiring the shot Kline ran out and
mounted his horse and started for a cattle
camp, twenty miles distant in the moun
tains.
Ou the way he passed a house where a
woman was staying to whom he was en
gaged. He made signals indicating that
he was pursued, but yielded to her im
ploraing to stop and say good-by. The
posse in pursuit, consisting of Â« Sheriff's
deputies and an indignant mob of men,
came in sigiit of Pete* norse standing in
front of the house. They came up before
Pete was halfway out of the house.
There was a chorus of yells of "Hang
him!" The desperado shouted back,
"Never," and opened fire on the crowd.
One man was wounded. Kline refused to
throw up his hands and the posse opened
fire, killing him instantly.
Kline was a cowboy and was considered
a desperate character. He had killed
more than his one man, it is said. His
victim. Garner, will probably recover, al
though he has a dangerous wound.
PAID TO TAKE
HUMAN LIFE
[Continued from First Piiqz.\
"would have beenworth $8000 to Schwetzer'
if her husband had been killed on the
night that he was shot at. Farther, it is
said that the daughter who was wounded
has always maintained that she recognized
the man who fired the shot, and that it
was Barker, a man who had lived near
her father's place on Pine Ridge.
Detective Harrison has still another cir
cumstance to add to all this. He declares
that he was approached by a brother of
Deputy Constable Henry with an offer of
a 'â¢consideration" to hush this matter up.
"Henry came to me." says Harrison,
"and remarked that he understood that
there was something out against Schwei
zer. I told him there was considerable
out against him. He said that Schweizer
waÂ« a man of family, that any trouble of
the kind indicated would ruin not only
him but others, and if it could be avoided
he would like to nave it done, as he was a
friend of Schweizer's. I told him that I
knew Schweizer was guilty and that I
thought he (Henry) did too. Henry re
plied, 'Yes, I believe there was something
wrong about it, but it would ruin his
whole family if he were arrested.'
"In order to put him off I told him that
I couldn't say what misht be done with
out, consulting my partner. With that I
left him, saying that I would telegraph
and let him know. The next day I met
him and he asked me what I hau heard,
if anything. I told him the matter could
not be fixed."
These are the statements which have
been made before the District Attorney,
and which he will present to. the Grand
Jury at its session on Monday. They
have bit by bit become public talk and tie
interest in the scandal has grown to fever
heat. The citizens have taken sides ac
cording as they believe or do not believe
them. The very many friends of Charles
Schweizer, gained through a large and
honored business career in tnis City, not
heretofore marred by a single act that
might lay him open to distrust, are not
ready to forsake him in the face of what
seems altogether impossible charges.
De Morais, who is figuring prominently
in the case, was formerly a partner of
Lehmann in a sawmill on Pine R-.dse. The
mill was destroyed by (ire and this broke
up the partnership. De Morais is well
known throughout the county, but his
record is not of the best. About a year
ago Mrs. Kate Mitchell, a lodging-house
keeper, bud him arrested for breaking
into her trunk and stealing several
hundr r<J dollars. De Morais claimed that
it was a scheme to blackmail him, bis al
leged persecutors being Mrs. Mitchell and
George Rupert. The case was in court for
some time, but was finally dismissed. De
Morais is now working on a ranch in tbe
country. He formerly had considerable
money.
Al Henry, the Deputy Sheriff who says
Harrison was bent solely on extorting
money from the merchant, declares that
John W.Lambert, whoshot and killed Alex
Uetbeder last summer at Firebaugh, was a
party to the alleged scheme and acted as
go-between for Harrison. Mr. Henry has
made the following statement:
"I was at work in tije Courthouse park o"n
the forenoon of tne 14th of this month when
John Lambert camo up to me. He began
to speak about the kindness tnat I nad
shown him while he waÂ» confined in the
county jail awaiting ttial for murder, and
he said that he believed that the time had
come when he could return the favors.
"He knew, he said, that I was a good
friend of Charles Schweizer, and he con
sidered that any favor he could do for the
harness-dealer would be very much ap
preciated by myself. This he was in a
position to do, he added, and would be
glad to render any assistance to Mr.
Schweizer.
"Lambert then told me that some de
tectives from San Jose had gathered evi
dence showing that Schweizer was guilty
of a serious crime, and intended to insti
tute p-oceedings against him. Lambert
wanted me to tell Schweizer of it, as the
information might be of service to him.
I asted what the charge was, but Lam
bert said he did not know. I went to see
Schweizer as soon as I could and informed
him of what 1 had been told. He ap
peared to be very much surprised and re
plied that he could not imagine what the
charge could be, as he had done nothing
in his life to warrant any such action.
'In the evening I met Lambert again
at Doble's saloon and told him what
Schwaizer had said, and we talked about
the case for some time. All that Lambert
said he knew was that the charge was a
very serioua one, and he hoped tnat
Schweizer would get out of it as he was a
friend of mine. The following evening
about 7 o'clock Lambert came to my house
on North 1 street, and Baid that he had
learned something of the charge against
Sch weizer. in substance it was tnat
Scuweizer had faired a fellow to murder a
man on whose life ne held a *5000 insur
ance policy. The gun used and the hat of
the shooteV were in the possession of the
detective. Lambert said that he thought
the matter could be 'fixed,' however, if
they could get around to it in time, before
the case was brought to the attention of
the authorities. We then ai ranged that 1
should have a meeting that uight with the
detective who proved to be John Ham
son. I wanted tp follow tne matter up as
far as I could.
"Harrison and I held our meeting m a
back room at Doble'a saloon, and there for
the first time I learned that it was the
Lehmann shooting with which Schweizer
was being connected. The detective so
told me. We then talked o! having the
case dropped, and Harrison remarked that
'No small sum of money could do it.
Wnen 1 asked for an approximate ngure
he answered, 'Two or three thousand uol
lars.' He could not give me any definite
proposition, he said, until he had heard
from his partner, who was in ban Jose,
i inquired how long it would take to hear
from him, and Harrison said about 11
o'clock the next day, which was Wednes
day. The detective would not tell me
anything about the evidence be had
against Schweizer. He asserted it was
conclusive.
"The next morning I saw Schweizer and
told him ot the proposition that had been
made. We went to Attorney Walser's
office, and they both asserted positively
that they would yield to no blackmailing
scheme, and were willing for Harrison to
shoot his guns. At 11 o'clock thedetective
came to me in the par* and told me he had
heard from his partner and was in a posi
tion to do business. He wanted me to
meet him at Doble's saloon that evening.
I aid so, and then communicated
Schweizer's answer to him. Harrison
seemed to be very much put out. He re
marked that if Schweizer did not put up
the money by the next day he would be
arrested."
After this the Deputy Sheriff saw noth
ing more of Harrison or Lambert.

THEIR HOPES BLIGHTED.
The Career of Defeated Presidential
Candidates Since iB6O.
Seward's Presidential ambitions van
ished when the nomination which he cov
eted went to Lincoln, and Breckinriilge
and Douglas were the other wrecks left ou
the shore by the political storm of 1860.
During tne war the former commanded a
Confederate regiment in the field and
served ior a time in Davis' Cabinet, but
his heart was never in the secession
movement, and when it was overthrown
he felt that his career was ended. He
went back to Kentucky, expecting to take
up the practice of law, but did not live
long after he retired to private life. Doug
las, when the war opened, was prompt
and outspoken in support of the Union,
end had he lived he probably would have
been one of Lincoln's most valued ad
visers.
But he had been ailing for more than a
year aua the mighty strain of the canvass
of 1860, coupled with grief at the hopeless
rupiure of his party, undermined his con
stitution.. He sank rapidly, and when it
was evident that his day was ending he
sent for his sister to come and nurse him
during his last hours. After hisdeath the
manifestations of resDect revealed the
mighty hold which ne had upon his party
and the admiration his great opponent
had come to feel for him because of his
splendid stand for ihe Union. No part of
Douglas' lite so well became him as its
close.
After the campaign of 1864 General Me-
Clellan emerged but once trom his self
sought retirement. In 1877 he was nomi
nated for Governor by the New Jersey
Democrat* and elected. This was the only
political office he ever held, and when his
term was over he returned to his pleasant
home in Orange, where the balance of his
life was spent. . He died suddenly, witn
out warning of illness, some teu years ago.
Horatio Seymour survived for a dozen
years or more the crushing defeat by
Grant in 1868, but thereafter took small if
any part in public affairs. Horace Greeley
aied le?s than a month after the election
of 1872.
His death, however, was not due to
disappointment at his lailure to reach the
Presidencyâ he had known for weeks that
the tide had set strongly against himâ but
to the exhaustion of . the campaign, fol
lowed as it was Dy the tender, nursing of
bis wife, who fell and died a few weeks be
fore election day. The strain was too
great. Insomnia seized him with all its
horrors, and it seemed to those who knew
him as if he, realizing that he had danger
ously strained nls physical and mental
powers, gave up at once without making a
struggle for life. . â  â .â¢â¢ '**
Tiluen in 1876 accepted the loss of the
Presidency with perfect composure. If he
had personal disappointments or nour
ished resentment no one knew it. Within
a month after the ssating of Hayes he
carried tnrough an important business
enterprise which added millions to his
already large fortune. A little later be

A PECULIAR FISH.
The Turbot'a Ball and Socket KyeÂ« Are
of Blacit and Gold.
Lying limp and slimy on a fishrronger's
slab, or dry and sandy in the Dutch fish
wives' baskets, the turbot is perhaps the
least interesting of fish. When swimming
in an artificial sea or lying on the sandy
bottom it is the most attractive of all the
denizens of this mock ocean, and whether
at rest or in motion has an air of vigilance,
vivacity and intelligence greater than that
of any of the normally shaped fish. This
is in part due to his nabits and in part to
the expression of the flat fish's eye. This,
which is sunk and invisible in the dead
fish, is raised on a kind of turret in the
Jiving turbot, or sole, and set there in a
half-revolving apparatus, working almost
as independently as the "ball and socket"
eyes of the chameleon.
There is a difference, however, in the
eye of the lizard and of tbe fish â the iris
01 the chameleon is a mere pinhole at the
top of the eyeball, which is thus abso
lutely without expression. The turbot's
or"butt's" ej'es are black and gold and in
tenstily bright with none of the fixed,
staring, stupid appearances of ordinary
fishe'seyes. It lies upon the aand and
jerks its eyes independently into position
to survey any part of the ground surface,
and the water above or that on either side
at any angle.
If it had light rays to project from ita
eyes instead of to receive the effect would
be precisely that made by the sudden
shifting of the jointed apparatus which
casts the electric ligbt from a warship |at
any angle on the sea, sky or horizon. The
turbots, though ready, graceful swim
mers, moving in warlike undulations
across the water, or dashing off like a
flash when so disposed, usually lie per
fectly still upon the bottom. They do not,
like the dabs and flounders, cover them
selves with sand, for they mimic tne
color of tbe ground with such absolute
fidelity that except for the shining eye it
is almost impossible to distinguish them.
It would appear that volition plays some
part in this subtle conformity to environ
ment, for one turbot, which is blind, has
changed a tint too light and not all in
harmony with that of the sand. â London
Spectator.
The Tyrant on the Mantelpiece.
It Is no exaggeration to say that the
clock is gradually enslaving the whole of
the civilized world. Not one of us but can
call to mind among our acquaintances in
dividuals who belong body and soul to tne
clock â whose whole lives are dominated
by its chimes and intervals. Tbe attitude
ot such persons is one of servile deference
to the clock.
Everything they do is with a view of
conforming to its wishes. They sleep by
the clock, dress by the clock, eat by the
clock, sit, walk, read, smoke, work by the
clock. Their heads are full of periods of
time â hours, minutes and seconds. They
spend their lives counting them. They
can never enjoy themselves or let them
selves go without pulling themselves up
suddenly for fear they should forget the
clock.
They will stop doing something ussful,
interesting and enjoyable and force them
selves to (Jo something dull and uninter
esting simply because the clock happened
to strike. And no matter how greatly
they desire to change an irksome occupa
tion they will stick to it, because, for
sooth, the clock nas not yet struck. They
may be enjoying tbe most deligh tf ul slum
ber of a morniug, but wiil bound out of
bed like a skyrocket because the clock
happens to striKe. And though they have
not the slightest inclination for sleep they
will put themselves forcibly to bed be
cause the finger of the clock" marks a cer
tain hour. Their whole lives are spent in
trying to force their natures into accord
ance with a mere machine.
Such people are as much slaves to the
clock as the genii in the story of Aladdin
were slaves to the lamp. Tney are per
petually at its beck and cull, and ninst
obey its voice a3 they would that of the
veriest tyrant. â Pall Mall Gazette.

IN A SALOON
Dave Fauss Fires Three
Bullets Into Joseph
Manning.
The Wounded Man Said the
Trouble Was Over a Woman
Named Sophie Smith.
So Quiatly and Quickly Was the Deed
Done That Fauss Succeeded in
Making His Escape.
Joseph Manning, sn ex- baseball player,
.36 years of ace, was shot three times and
fatally wounded in Henry Hoffman's
t-aloon, 112 Fourth street, last evening.
Manning and a companion were seated
at a table in ihe saloon playing a friendly
game of cards about 6 o'clock and several
men were standing at the ban Manning
was sitting facing the entrance.
The people in the place were startled by
hearing three shots tired in rapid succes
sion and on wheeling arcund saw Manning
. witn a eroan fall to the Uoor. Manning's
companion was stanaing with a glazed
look on his face, and simultaneously all
. bl p.ds ran out of the saloon to look for the
. Am who had fired the shots, but be had
disappeared as if the earth had swallowed
him up.
The. only man who saw the would-be
murderer was a man wno does odd jobs
around the saloon. He saw a short man
with a revolver in his band running out
of the saloon. Neither of the bartenders
saw him enter or leave the saloon, nor
any of the customers at the bar; at least,
according to their statement. They ac
counted lor it by saying that they were too
much taken by surprise and did not turn
around quick enough, not thinking for a
moment that the shots had been fired in
the saloon.
The Southern police station was noti
fied aad Policemen T. L. Ryan and Ed
ODea were promptly detailed on the case
and commenced a vigorous search for the
shooter.
Manning was taken to the Receiving
Hospital in the ambulance and Dr. Bun
\rjeh found that the three bullets had
.entered the right breast, each about an
inch and a half apart. Each went clear
. through his body, piercing tne right lung,
and Dr. Bunnell expressed the opinion
rthat the wounds would prove fatal.
Manning at first said he did not know
who fired the shots, but Jater, in makine
â an ante-mortem statement to Corporal
Cub, he said the man was Dave Fauss
and ihe trouble was over a woman named
Sophie Smith. Monday night he and
fauss had a fight over the woman and
Fauss, who is older and smaller than Man
ning, threatened to "get even," as he got
the wor-t of the fight.
Manning, Fauss and Sophie Smith lived
at 520 Mis-ion street, and each man was
jealous of the other's attentions to ner.
Fauss in 1887 was short-stop of the lowa
baseball team, when Manning toot his
place. Lt is said that Fauss has borne a
<:rudee against Manning since then, be
lieving that he intrigued to succeed him,
and that had as much to do with the
shooting last evening aa the woman
t-rnith.
Manning died about 10 r. M.
IN CHILDHOOD'S REALM.
â¢* Charming Christmas Festival In the
Howard Presbyterian Church.
The Christmas festival of the Howard
Presbyterian Church, on Oak and Baker
streets, held last evening, was decidedly
different from the usual order of churca
festivals. The elements of novelty, new
ness, originality and snap constituted the
prevailing spirit of the evening. It was
the first Christmas celebration since the
church was moved to the panhandle dis
trict and the building was filled even to
the choir galleries on each end. Those
who had arranged the festival caused their
enthusiasm to be spread to the large
gathering-
It was strictly a children's occasion. In
.fact, there were no old people there.
Tne evening was opened with music,
followed by a prayer by the pastor, Rev.
It 1 . R. Farrand, and addresses by the pas
tor and J. P. Putzraan, the superintendent
Of the Sabbath-school. Then came the
event of the evening, a Christmas caniata,
"The Enclianted Castle," and for an hour
or more the gathering was away in dream
land. Arabian Nights, fairies, brownies,
etc, were the uppermost features.
There was a large platform beautifully
decorated, on one corner of which stood a
gorgeous Christmas tree. The first scene
â¢was that of two little on-s asleep in their
trundle-bed. These were little Arthur
. and Fred Uurlingame. Near by was a
deep fireplace, with stocking! hanging on
the mantel. Santa Claus, personated by
Rudolph S. A. Isenbruck appears and
fills the sti, ;kings. His hand passes over
tne heads of the slumbering youngsters,
and they dream.
. Their dream on the programme is scene
2, fairies and brownies appear in cos
tumes white, spangled, gauzy and unique.
; They sing, and their songs are tlioseof
oLdeodays. For a time the Fairy Queen
{Miss Ruby Moore), Aladdin (Carl Hoden
feldt), Sinbad the Sailor (Rollin Harris)
and their followers hold sway. Santa
Oiaus appears and complains that his
1 pleigh loaded with presents broke down.
He cails upon Aladdin to help him out ot
.his trouble. Aladdin rubs his wonderful
lamp and the enchanted rastle appears in
'â¢the background, every brick of wuich is a
box of fine candy for the children.
â¢â â  Santa Ciaus sets to work to tear down
the castle, which in a short time was in
. the possession of the Sabbath-school
children, some 400 in number.
All 01 this was accomplished with vari
. colored calcium light effects and vocal and
â¢instrumental music. Upon Miss Pearl
â Noble and Mrs. J. T. McUonald fell the
task of arranging for the entertainment.
The former provided an orchestra of fif
teen pieces and Mn, McDonald was kept
busy drilling the fairies and brownies for
. their respective parts. _.-"._

WAS A REAL PIRATE.
The Death of a Skipper Who Was for
Years a Terror of the South Seas.
News has just come to band by the re
cruiting vessel Rio Loge of the death of
one of those celebiities or characters of
the South Seas known as Pirate Martin.
On interviewing Doujrlas Rannie our rep
resentative gleaned the following particu
lars:
"1 knew Pirate Martin well and often
met him during my travels. He was a
line-looking, handsome man, ana had the
appearance more of a soldier than a sailor.
He seemed to be always i;i hot water and
I never met him without he had a griev
ance on hand. My first introduction to
him was to dress a wound in his chest.
He had been gambling in a trader's house
and had a iarije sum of money about him.
"While sitting m a room adjoining the
store, the store being in darkness, a shot
came irom the store, and the bullet
ploughed across Martin's chest, making a
very ugly wound. The wouid-be assassin
was the man who managed f!:e store, and
immediately decamped after firing: tiie
shot. But not to be outdone, Martin
brought a case of c^-narnite ashore, and
placing it under the store, threatened to
blow the whole concern sky high ii the
man who snot him did not turn up. The
result was that a search party went out
and soon returned with the delinquent,
who was shaking with tear. Martin then
gave him a chance of settling the affair
with weapons on the beach, but the trader
was too much of a cur and a coward to
tight, so Martin, whose temper had cooled
down, let him off for a consideration.
"The next occasion on which 1 came
across Martin was when I waÂ« takine a
trip on a French schooner, the Dauphine,
Captain Demosehe, my own vessel having
been lost. Ihe only other Britisher on
board the Dauphine except myself was
the mate, Dick Henderson. As it hap
pened, one fine morning we were close to
Ambrym, when what should run out but
the cutter Constantine, Pirate Martin in
charge. He wanted us to heave to. and
he ran up the French flag to his mast
head, but old Demoselle would not heave
to, but called his mate and said: 'Dick,
bring de pigÂ« The pig was brought.
'Now, den, Dick, bring yon bottle.' An
empty bottle then showed up. 'Now, den,
Dick, make the bottle fast to the pig'n
head, den bend on the signal halliards ana
run 'em up to the main peak.' And up
went P'g, bottle and all as a reply to Mar
tin's signal, and old Frenchy drew him
sell up as he remarked, 'Dere, now, you
tarn buccaneer, 1 tell you you yon drunken
Pig
"Martin's reply was a shot which made
old Frenchy scuttle below and sing out to
the mate, 'Dick, put on all de sail you
can.'
"Martin was supposed to be trading for
a firm of Noumean merchants when sail
ing the Constantine. But when he got a
full ship be disposeu of the cargo, sola the
ship and proceeded to Sydney, where he
lived in quite a royal style till the money
was spent. Then the longing came over
him and he started lor the islands again.
When the steamer in which be was a
passenger called at Noumea, the French
police got word of his being on board and
went to arrest him, but too late, as Martin
had got the tip and gone ashore. There
be annexed a boat, took in supplies, and
ma.:e for the New Hebrides alone, and
arrived.
"My next meeting with him was on the
coast of Aoba. He was then in command
of a schooner called the Black Angel. He
told me then that he was the avenger of
blood. A Mr. Pana had been murdered
by his native crew. They had looted the
vessel and had left her to drift anywhere.
Some of them had got to Aoba, and now
it was Martin's intention to shoot them on
sight, and I believe that he eventually car
ried out his intention.
"The last 1 saw of the old pirate was up
the river from Port Sandwich, and he had
then turned his attention to agricultural
pursuits. He had a very pretty site for
his house,' and on either side tie had a
plantation of coffee, with some fields of
corn and with fruit in plenty. And there
he reckoned he would have a lonp spell if
left to enjoy life without interruptions
from the natives. But at last one of those
swaggering blades whom you will find
among South Sea Islanders, as well as
whites, made public his intention of pot
ting old Martin. So one day Martin was
entertaining some visitors to dinner when
Â«ne of his servants came and whispered in
his ear.
"Martin got up from the table, saying
'Excuse me, gentlemen, for a minute,'
and, picking up his rifle, he went outside.
He returned in a few minutes and sal
down as if nothing unusual had taken
place. In about an hour's time his ser
vant again whispered to him, and, as
before, he picked up his rifle and went
out, apologizing for his temporary ab
sence. Suddenly a shot was heard and
then a laugh. On goins out the guests
fouud old Pirate Martin standing with
gun in hand, a dyins: native in his death
struggle on the ground a:.d a cnief in
irons bound last to a tree. It seems that
Martin had got notice from his servant of
tiie arrival of the caief, had bound him to
a tree and threatened him with deatn if
the man who had avowed his intention of
shooting Martin was not produced. The
victim was sent for and, as Martin re
marked,' Well, I had llits first shot in. 1 â

The albino he met alone in a stretch of

shooting. His first shot, tired at a dis

The buck, which has been hung up in
Mr. Howard's yard on Spring street,

attention. To begin with, it is a large
one, with good antlers. The neck is mot

has the usual gray and brown markings,

LIBRARIES IN TURKEY.
Many Opportunities for Learning in the
Sultun's Realm.
To read of the bnrbariMn of the Turks
one would come to a direct conclusion that
the vicious expounders of the Mohamme
dan religion had very few advantages
placed at their disposal to cultivate their
morals and principles and elevate them
selves to a higher plane of life. This is a
ridiculous notion, says the New York Mail
and Express. Constantinople has no less
than forty libraries, each containing in
the neighborhood of 1000 volumes.
Although this great abundance of liter
ature is placed within reach of every Turk
the books are only used by the higher
clashes. The Mohammedan creed does
not instruct the Turks to repudiate knowl
edge, which idea seems to prevail in
America, but, on the other hand. Mo
hammed instructed his followers to ac
quire knowledge and use it to good ad
vantace. The early Suitans, as well as
their predecessors, the Saracen califs, were
highly educated, and a direct contrast
with the present dynasty of the blood
stainpd throne. They were the patrons
and zealous seekers ot knowledge.
"Be the support qf the fnith and the
protectors of the sciences" was the dying
declaration of the first Osman to his suc
cessor. Orckan, in the beginning of the
fourteenth century.
That the later Sultans have failed to ad
here to the teachinns of the Koran is
apparent from the present deplorable con
dition of the country. It is nothing more
than a retrogression, a drifting from civil
ization to barbarism and ignorance.
One of the modes in which tiie early
rulers of Turkey showed their desire for
learning is the establishment of their li
braries either in connection wi!h the
mosques and colleges or apart as distinct
institutions. Red, jrreen or bluclc are the
predominating colors of the binding of
volumes. The bindings are of leather, and
to protect the boots from moths, dust
worms, etc., the books are inclosed in
similar material. This protection was a
wise conception, for the destructive little
insects would have found fresh material
in uncnt volumes. The titles of many of
the volumes, insiead of being printed on
the back, are marked first upon the
edsre of the leaves.
Cases, with glass and ironwork fronts,
are ranged along the walls of the library.
T liese libraries are open on every day of
the week except Tuesday and Friday.
Visitors are allowed to use any book,
make extracts from it or, if they desire,
copy the entire manuscripts. Tha sub
ject* of the greater part of the worKs ar<',
of course, analogous to the studies taken
up in the colleges. The mass of books
contain copies of ihe Koran and com
ments upon it, also the collection of the
oral laws of Mohammed.
The manuscriMs are all written on the
finest vellum, and some of them afford
beautiful specimens of penmanship. Most
ol these collections are being ad<Jed to by
the produce oi the surplus funds arising
from the original endowments, and a'so
by the liberal contributions of the lew
literary arinnrers. The man of letters,
the statesman or the iuwyer at his death
generally bequeaths his collection to the
libraries and receives the benedictions of
thuse who avail themselves of the vol
umes.
Tar and Jb'cathers.
"There is a genpral impression, in this
country at least, that the institutioit
known as 'tar and feathers' is disiinctively
American. Nothing could bj further from
the mark," observed Judge Riley, of the
Virginia bar. 'The fact is, what we un
derstand to be a coating of tar and feathers
is of ancient origin. There is also an idea
afloat that tar and feathers is a sort of
Southern celebration, that it was invented
there, and that it is of common occur
rence in that section of our loved country.
1 assure you that both these ideas are
wrong all the way through. In the fir-t
place, while there is plenty of tar in the
South the stock of feathers is not so larse.
And again, tney are too valuable to use in
such a way.
"Where a person deserves such a treat
ment it is much easief and better to give
him a thorough cowhidiug. A cowhiding
sticks as well as a coating of tar, if prop
erly applied. Tar and feathers originated
in the days of Richard Cceur de Lion, over
800 years ago, aa is evidenced by one of
his ordinances for seamen, ai follows:
'That if any man Is taken with theft or
pickery, and thereof convicted, he shall
have his head polled and hot pitch poured
upon bis pate, and upon that the feathers
of some pillow or cushion shaken aloft
that he may be known for a thief. ' "

"IHIi CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Christmas eve.
Don t crowd too much.
Congress has made a home run.
The bargain must be attended to to-day.
Leave your orders for the Christmas
Call.
Give your help to-day to cheer the
friendless to-morrow.
As soon as one street gets itself lighted
another sets to work to beat it.
Charity as well as friendship claims the
attention of the generous giver.
Leave the -shops free this evening to
those who cannot trade in the daytime.
The holiday of to-morrow will be a
blessed rest to the bargain-counter clerk.
Santa Clans has hitched his wagon to
the star of empire and is coming West
rapidly.
What you do for charity to-day will add
to the pleasure of your enjoyment to
morrow.
If Cleveland does not pet the recogni
tion of Cuba into his head pretty soon he
will get it in the neck.
Enjoy as much as you can to-day the
pleasure of anticipation. The realization
of to-morrow may have flies on it.
The San Joaauin gets the best Christ
mas gi.t of the year in opening of the
Valley road for passenger business.
There is no climate on earth so con
genial to Christmas as ours and nowhere
else will the day afford such a variety of
pleasures.
It is easy to make fun of the horse
show, but fun don't improve the busi
ness of tiie horse market, and the horse
Bhow did.
"Sound to the core is the way the San
Franciscans celebrate Christmas." That
is what Haweis said about us. Now let us
live up to it.
The report of the Grand Jury tells u
we have many evils in the City anil
County, and now will somebody tell us
how to get rid of them?
There is no loneer a monopoly of trans
portation in tne San Joaquin and before
long there will bs no such monopoly in
any portion of the State.
One of the things which make this
Christmas brighter than those of the last
three years' is the prospect that next
Christmas will be brighter still.
The Christmas Call will be a good New
Year's present for your Eastern friends.
It will give them a fair picture of the State
and some idea of the giory thereof.
It will soon be the "San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Road," in fact as well
as name. vVa have reason therefore for a
little more joy than usual at this season.
Tho House has broken the record in the
performance of business before Christ
mas, but the Senate has kept intact the
old record of much talk and very little
work.
There is consolation in tbe weather for
everybody. Those who did their shop
ping before the rain yesterday had sun
shine â those who waited were in the
swim.
The Senators were so eager to get at the
funding bill they coald not wait for the
bill to be reported before they began dis
cussing it. It is evident that a lively right
is in prospect.
The Salvation Army will carry Christ
mas cheer to those who need it most, ana
you will have a better right to your own
cheer during the day if you help the Army
in its good work.
The speeches made before the Govern
ment Commission in favor of Santa Mon
ica may in courtesy bs called arguments,
but it strains even a warm-hearted Christ-
mas charity to do it.
The Christmas Call will contain forty
two pages. The home postaee on it will
be three cents and the foreign postage
live cents. Don't forget this in mailing
copies to your friends.
The recommendation of Secretary Car
lisle that we should practice economy by
cutting down appropriations for public
improvements will not be received with
favor by the people. That sort of practice
would be the economy which tendeth to
poverty and the wisdom of the Nation re
jects it.
If Congress should pass the resolution
recognizing the independence of Cuba and
Cleveland should ignore it there would be
nothing to do but to wait for him to get
out of office. It would be of no use trying
to impeach him unless Congress should
feel like doing it for ihe purpose of estab
ling a precedent.
In a statement concerning the Valley
Roaa published in The Call yesterday
Mr. Claus Sprcckeb said over his own sig
r.atur : "We shall come to San Fraucisco
as soon as the Bakersfield extension is
compleled. The people need have no fear
on that point." Here is a soiden Christ
mas promise whose realization may be
looked for iv a glad new year.
THE COMPETING ROAD.
The statement of Claus Spreckels pub
lished in The Calt, yesterday gives a dis
tinct and reliable promise that the road
which is popularly known as Ihe "Valley
road' will soon merit and receive from
the public its full title, "The San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad."
It wili be a competing line, not oniy for
the great valley of the interior. Dut for
San Francisco, and will secure for the
metropolis relief from a portion of the
long-endured cinch of the monopoly of
the Southern Pacific.
Mr. Spreckels, after pointing out that
the road will be extended from Fresno to
Bakersfield as soon as rights of way are
obtained, and that if no unexpected obsta
cle occurs the line will reach Bakersfield
by May, went on to say: "We will come
to San Francisco as soon as the Bakers
field extension is completed. The people
need have no fear on that point. The way
into San Francisco is open to us by more
than one route and there is nothing can
prevent our entrance."
This is a golden promise for Christmas,
of which we may expect the beginning ol
the fulfillment during the new year. A
completion of the line to this City means
far more to San Francisco and to
the interior than would be possible
to say within ordinary limits. The
farmers of the great valley of the
San Joaquin a:id the merchants of the
cities within its borders, as well as the
merchants of San Francisco, will compre
hend without arcument on our part the
creat benefits which tbev wili derive from
the accomplishment of the work. It will
mean the breaking down of the monopoly
which has so long interfered with locul
trade and the immediate expansion of
commerce under freer and better condi
tions.
No enterprise of the past year has been
so beneficial to California as the construc
tion of this road through the San Joaquin,
and none now proposed for tne future
promises so much of good. Mr. Sprecksls
described the situation in saying: "There
are many enterprises in which a return of 6
per cent could be made on the capital in
vested, but I prefer this project, as it will
lend to develop the State to an extent
l reat r than anything else that could be
done by public or private enterprise."
That is exactly what it will do. It will de
velop the State, and in the development
every citizen will find a benefit, advantage
and profit.
Even in its present condition a com
peting line is of great benefit to the peoplr
of California. It has given to the San
Joaquin lower freight rates and lower pas
senger rates than they could have even
hoped for before its construction was
undertaken. It affords better facilities
for commerce and passenger travel than
the monopoly has given, and if it went no
further would still be accounted as one 01
the best successes achieved by California
enterprise in promoting California in
dustry. The rates of passenger travel
between this City and points in the San
Joaquin Valley have been lowered to
half the rates which the Southern Pacific
Company charged, and moreover the
means of travel between those points have
beeu improved and thÂ« t.me lessened.
As Mr. Spreckela said ill concluding his
statement, "It now remains with the
people to decide whether the road shall be
the fullest kind of a success." If proper
support is given and the company is
enabled to obtain riphts of way, it will not
be long before the road enters San Fran
cisco, and id prepared for an extension of
its line further southward than Bakers
lield. It is gratifying to know the com
pany has received pvery assurance of such
support. Mr. Spreckels says: "I have
every confidence we have now and sliail
always continue to have the support of
the people. They as we, I urn sure, fully
realize their interests and or.rs are one."
In this mutual confidence between the
company and the peop'e we have the full
est assurance of the speedy completion of
the great work. The reign of the roono
vtoly is nearly over. The people of Cali
fornia will soon have established their
commercial independence by their own
efforts.
THE GRAND JURY REPORT.
In the report made on the completion of
its work, the Grand Jury has furnished us
another of those public documents which
call attention to evils in our municipal
government, but which offer no sufficient
remedy for them. The people will read
the report with but little interest, because
they know it will have hardly any effect
upon any of the problems with which it
deals. It comes with the sound of one
"crying in the wilderness," instead of
speaking in the tone of one "having au
thority."
T:.e Grand Jury state they have found
the present law governing the collection
of personal property taxes "burdensome
and unsatisfactory," and they recommend
the repeal of the law so far as it applies to
San Francisco. They condemn the finan
cial management of the public schools,
which compels the department to make
deductions from amounts actually due
teachers earned as salaries, and express
the opinion that expenses incurred in the
employment of special teachers at high
salaries for the benefit of a few should be
abolished.
They report that the Morgue building is
old, dilapidated, and insufficiently sup
plied with the requisites for post-mortem
investigations. They recommend that
n. tubers of the Legislature should oppose
the passage of -any law increasing tbe
number of our Superior Courts. They
find that the economical running of the
County Clerk's office is a matter which
they somewhat wittily declare to be in the
hands and the conscience of the County
Clerk, and suggest tbe advisability of re
lieving him ot this strain by the adoption
of a new charter which shall place the
conduct of his office under different laws.
They declare the office of Water and Gas
Inspector to be devised principally to en
able "some favored, applicant to draw a
good salary for very inadequate service,"
and recommend that it be abolished.
They urge the removal of the fire-alarm
station from its present location in China
town to the dome of the new City Hal!,
and the establishment of a fully paid de
partment. They condemn the filthy con
dition of the City Hall, and "suggest"
that the. head janitor be obliged to devote
all of his time to attending to his busi
ness in trie- building. They disapprove
the action of the Board of Supervisors in
ordering the City and County Surveyor to
expunge from he new official map certain
streets and public highways, by resolu
tion. They point out also that upon a
large number of streets there are car
tracks not in use, but in regard to that
evil they make no recommendation what
ever.
On the important subject of suppressing
lottery swindles and the trade of the lot
tery fakers in the City the Grand Jury
speaks out clearly. They say :
On this subject we find the law is. defective,
inasmuch as it makes the crime misdemeanor
when it should be a felony, ft seems imDossl
ble to get at the managers and promoters of
the business. The police courts, lor some rea
son, are entirely too lenient in the matter of
penalties, as; they Have gradually reduced the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 189 S.
amount of fines imposed to merely a nominal
sum where formerly large fines were Imposed,
and the courts entlrelyomit the imprisonment
penalty. We recommend that the District At
torney prepare the necessary amendments to
the Penal Code whicti will make the law more
stringent aud effective, aud also prohibit ad
vertising through the papers or otherwise
anything pertaining to lotteries, before or
after the drawing; also maKe it prima facie
evidence of guilt to havo lottery tickets in
one's possession.
These are the salient features of the re
port, and it now remains to be seen what
effect it will have on our municipal ad
ministration. The Grand Jury itself
hardly expects much to result from its
labors. This is mad- evident by the state
ment in the closing paragraph: "It is a
well-known fact that after the long and
careful attention to public interests of the
various Grand Juries, their final t reports
have simply been received, accepted and
pigeonholed, and the Grand Jury dis
charged."
To remedy this evil the Grand Jury rec
ommends "that this and all future reports
of Grand Juries shall be included in the
annual printed aud municipal reports of
this City." It is doubtful whether the
matter would be helped much if the rec
ommendation were adopted. We need
something more than tho printing of
thene reports. We need earnest action
taken to suppress the evils which are
pointed out, and if the Grand Jury itself
is incapable of doing that it is not easy to
see to what other power we should look
for authority to deal with the subject.
THE CHRISTMAS "CALL."
To-morrow morning the Christmas edi
tion of Thb Call will greet its host of
readers with the compliments of the sea
son.
The splendid edition has been in prepar
ation for many weeks. Only the best lit
erary and artistic work has Deen permitted
to go into its pages and as a consequence
it will stand without a peer as the Christ
mas paper of the West.
In all there will be about twenty-five
richly illustrated articles appropriate to
the season.
"Cosmos and Rico" is a story by Ern
est Reconato of this City. It points the
way to true happiness and should be read
by all.
There will be a Christmas poem by Miss
Juliet Wilbor Tompkins that is a gem in
its way.
"Christmas Visitors at Onslow Gar
dens" is a bit of descriptive' writing of the
most pleasing character.
"Christmas at Sutter's Fort in 1847,"
by John Bonner, should be read by all
Californians. The name of the author is
sufficient attest to its cleverness.
The literary value of Ihe story of
"Christ," by J. H. Gnffes, isan able article
tiiat will ba widely appreciated.
Among the other features of the Christ
mas Call might be mentioned: "Christ
mas in the Arctic Circle," "A Chinese St.
Nicholas "White Christmas in Cali
fornia," "A Rose of the Garden of Eden."
Remember that your Eastern friends
will be delighted to get a Christmas Call,
and do not forget to order your extra
copies to-day. It will be by lone odds the
best holiday paper of the year, and will be
a veritable treasure In every household.
Not aline of it will oe dry reading, and
there will be several humorous features
hat will bring to the reader many a good
hearty and healthy laugh.
The illustrations will be surpassingly
fine, and on the whole the Christmas edi
tion of The Call will be a desirable
Christmas treasure.
The postage on the 42-page Christmas
Call will be as follows: Foreign, 5 cents;
United States, Canada and Mexico, 3 cents.
THE NEW TARIFF.
It is gratifying to observe that in dis
cussing the tariff legislation of the next
Congress leading papers of the great East
ern cities are giving much space to a
consideration of what shall be done for
the rural industries of the country. They
no longer direct their attention solely to
manufactures. It is now agreed in the
East as well as in the West, in the great
cities as well as in the country, that
farmers as well as manufacturers need
protection and deserve to receive it from
any future tariff legislation.
Commenting on this feature of the work
the New York Pras says:
The comfortable notion that, outside of his
wool, the farmer needed no protection must
have been thoronghly disiipited by the im
portation of $130,000,000 of agricultural
products under the first year of tho present
tariff. Moreover, some steps must bo tnken to
stop the enormous drain consequent upon
sending abroad for cune sugar when tiie ex
perience of Continental countries assures us
of the perfect practicability of securing a
cheap and adequate supply of beet sugar at
home. There is $100,000,000 annually for
American pockets in the proper handling of
this part of the agricultural schedules.
There can be no question but what these
expressons of the press in the great cities
of the East represent the prevailin senti
ment of protectionists everywhere. In
making up the new tariff the Republicans
in Congress will give to the agricultural
schedules even greater attention than was
piven by the committee which framed the
McKinley tariff. Almost all of our rural
industries have reached a stage where they
come into competition to a sreater or less
extent with the cheap labor of other por
tions of the world. This is particularly
true of California. Our lumbermen are
injured by the cheaper lumbering system
of Canada, and our growers of tropical
fruits in the southern part of the State are
deprived of much of the profits of their
industry by the competition of fruit
growers in Mexico, where land and labor
are much cheaper than here.
There will be no talk in tho next Con
gress of free raw materials. That folly has
been tried and proven disastrous. Pro
tection hereafter must apply to the indus
tries of all classes of the American people.
It must affect with an equal beneficence
every section of the Union and every in
dustry of every State. The protective sys
tem becomes perfect only when it is made
universal, and that is what we may expect
from the next Congress and the McKinley
administration.
A BIT OF LIFE.
A maiden sat within the door
And sung as many times Before.
A man to dally toil passed by,
JÂ»'o love nor pleasure lit his eye:
But when he heard the merry song
He whistled as be went along.
A woman by the window wept : .
For one who In the churchyard slept;
Hut when upon her heartoe fell
Thai tune she knew and love.i so well
1 he flood of burning tears was stay, d,
And soon a song (be lips essayed. ~ ? .
Her neighbor heard her tender strain,
And sofily joined the sweet refrain. ' '
Thus, ail day Ion? mat one song bore
Its ousm-ss from door to door.

INTERESTING TO CONSULS.
Philadelphia Press.
The Consular service was debauched and
demoralized by President Cleveland in the
first six months of his term. Wholesale re
movals were made and appointments con
ferred for political nnd personal reasons. In
the last year of his administration President
Cleveland placed ail but a few Consular of
fices within the classified service. There is a
general impression nbroiid that this will por
tect these paitisan appointments. It will not
audit ougut not.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The French papers speuk in the most enthu
siastic terms of the brilliant list of nrtists en
gaged for the opera season at Monte Carlo,
which opens next month. AdelinaPatli heads
the divas, and second on the list comes Mile.
Fannie Francesca of Snn Francisco. It is a
case of two stars, one setting and the other
rising. Mile. Francesca i? *aid 10 have the
same quality of voice as Melba and Patti. She
made her Parisian debut last summer at a
matinÂ«e given by Mme. Marchesi's pupils. No
one had heard of the American girl, but her
brilliant singing and superb stage presence so
astonished every one that she was alluded to
as the dark horse. Her Moiite Carlo engage
ment is considered a great triumph for a
debutante. She is to be the priina donna in
â¢'Rigoletto," "Oteilo," "Don Juan," "La Reine
de Saba" and "Amy Robsart." In addition to
Patti and Mile. Francesca, the stars engaged
MLLE. FANNY FRANCESCA as She Will Appear at Monte
Carlo in "Rigoletto."
for the season are: Mines. Van Zandt, Lola
Beeth, Mendioroz, Heglon, Marcy, Vuillaumo,
Raunay, Saffo Bellincione; tlie tenors are MM.
Van Dyck. Tamagno, Apostolu, Vergnet, Gi
raud, Queyle; the barytones, MM. Muurel,
Kaschmann, Carusson Bonnet, Melchissedes,
Albert; the bassos, MM. Bondouresque,
Isnnrdon, Oicjte, Bozzani.
Mile. Francesca is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. If. Miche.seu of this City. Her brother
believed so much in her talent that he pave up
a lucrative business in New York to accompany
her to Europe for study, and he has remained
with her ever since, encouraging ncr aud
spending a small fortune on her education.
Audran's new operetta "Monsieur Lohen
grin" seems to have met with great success at
the BouffeÃ-Pftrisiens. The libretto by Kabiice
Carre is especially good from the standpoint
of raising a laugh. Cecilo Blandin is one of
those young ladies who has studied singing
with a master who undertakes to make ''an
artist of you while you wait. " Cecile has paid
out all her money to the master, but no one
appreciates her singing; no one admires her
in any way except a police agent, whom she
scorns. In this dilemma she is introduced to a
mujestic gentleman, who not only promises
to spend thousands ou opening the doors of
the ouera-tiouses to her, but who also promises
to marry her, all on one conditionâ she is
never to ask his name. For a time everything
goes well, and he answers to the appellation of
Monsieur Lohengrin, but curiosity at iast gets
the better of Cecile, and she implore, him to
unveil las incognito. Monsieur Lohengrin
then pompously informs her that he is culled
Rothschild. It was not true, as Cectle finds
out in the end, but the double incognito gives
rise to amusing complications, aiid the would
be singer finally finds thai Monsieur Lohen
grin is an impostor, and renounces her
operatic aspinitious to marry her faithful
police agent. Hound this story the composer
of "La Mttscotte" has wriiten some very pretty
music
In the archives of the Royal Opera of Berlin
an interesting document has Just been found
which 'gives all the current expenses of the
theater for the year 1790. The cost of opera a
hundred years ago compared with the sums
paid out, especially in New York, to lyric
artists makes an Interesting study. The en
tire expenses for the year at the Berlin Opera
house in 179U amounted to 03.394 thalers and
the artists' salaries to 38,500 thalers. The
Prussian thaler was worth 75 cents, which
brings the total expenses to about $40,000-
The prima donna assoluta, one Mme. Schick,
received 1200 thulers a year and the leading
tenor, Herr Lippert, received 119G thalers a
year. This curious difference of four thalers
evidently marked the superiority of the
feminine star. In addition to their salaries
the leading -vingcr3 enjoyed a few benefits a
year, which brought them on an average
about 800 thalers. This wou 10. raise their an
nual incomes to about 2000 thaler." ($1500) at
the maximum. Economists calculate that the
purchasing power of silver in Berlin was in
1796 about three times greater than in 1896,
so that the $1500 of that day would mean now
about $4500. Even at that price the Berlin
opera of to-day could get no great singers.
The Thalia Theater, in Berlin, is playing
with success an opera comlque in one act, en
titled "Tho Hygrometer," irom the English
libretto of Adrian Ross, and the music of Ber
tram L. Selby. The action of the opera passes
in a box of toys and the stage is incumbered
with playthings, such as trees, toy-houses,
wooden horses, etc. In the midst of the toys
is placed the well-known hygrometer, a toy
house, with two doorways, in one of which
stands the figure of a man and in the other
of a woman, which come out, turn about, to
announce fine weather or rain. In "The Hy
grometer" the man and woman complain that
they can never see one another, In spite of
their love, and finally they organize a strike,
and coming out of their house, sing a love
duet. The dialogue is said to be very comical
and the music gay and taking.
The once famous singer, Bianca Blume,
has just died in a hospital at Buenos Ayros,
poor and abandoned. She was the first great
prima donna who created the operas of Wag
ner in Italian, and she was the object of es
pecial ovations at the Scaia, in Milan. A few
years ago, very much reduced in circum
stances, a Avldow, and broken down by tho
disappointments and disillusions of her ca
reer, she went to Buenos Ayres and devoted
herself to teaching singing. Fortune, how
ever, did not smile upon her, and the woman
who had shone in all the splendor of her
beauty and talent in the greatest theaters of
Italy died in a charity bed at a hospital des
titute and neglected.
According to the otlicial statement the for

a tour in the United States. And how many
times did Abbey not spend a tbousand francs
on iiis own pleasure! Truly, old Solou wa
right when he said, "You must wait till a man
is dead before you can sÂ»y whether he has

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
G. J. Griffith, who lascly gave a magnificent
park to Los Angeles, is at the Baldwin. The
park is the largest city p' rk in the world, con
sisting of over 3000 acres. It lies one mite
north of the north line of Los Angeles and is
about rive and a half miles long by two and a
hall wide. It fronts the long way on the Los
Angeles River, is ideal in its beauty and natu
ral location, and is worth a fortune.
The park is covered with California live
oaks, single trees of which cover a quarter of
an acre or nore. Besides these, there are
thousands of wild walnut trees, thousands of
sycamores, and tens ot thousands of willows,
the latter being along the river.
The picture nerewith represents Mr. Griffith
as he was last Wednesday when he gave the
G. J. GRIFFITH, Who Gave a Principality to Los Angeles
for a Park.
[Sketched from hje by a '-Call" artist.
3000-acre ,oarx to Los Angeles as a Christmas
gift. The park wÂ»s promptly accepted and
named after him.
The loiiowing is the modest, unique and un.
selfisn way he presented it:
' "Your Honor and gentlemen: la the course
of twenty-three years of active business life in
California I have become proudly attached to
our beautiful city of Los Angeles, which,
through iv great natural advantages and its
matchless climate, averaging 300 sunny days
in the year, is destined to soon become a
ureat metropolis. The arduous work of these
years has been rewarded with fair success, ana
recognizing the duty I will dccl this land to
the city as soon as the city engineer has estab
lished tho lines satisfactorily; but in making
this donation I would like to impose the con
dition, if after consideration it should appear
that it may be legaliy done, that no railroad
to this park be chartered with the right to
charge a larger fare than 5 cents. I wish to
impose this condition to insure this fare so
that this park will be in every sense the peo
ple's recreation grounds and tho transporta
tion to it be kept within the reach of the most
modest means.
"I wish to make this gift while I am still in
the full vigor of life that I mayÂ«njoy with
my neighbors its beauties and pleasures, and
that I may bear with me when I cross the
clouded river the pleasing knowledge of the
fruition of a wish long dear to me. I trust that
you will accept this gift for the people of Los
Angeles in the same spirit in which it is of
fered."
Tne gift is a royal one. It is 800 acres larger
than the largest park in Paris, and 300 acres
larger than Fairmount Park. Ptiiladelphia. It
borders on the famous Cahuenga Valley, as
well as on the Los Angeles River.

was lined throughout with pale blue chin*
silk (the hood being lined with the same), ai i
had a blue silk girdle, with cords to matcn,

I can be used on all edges and not detract from
its economy, for this so-called washable ribbon
really washes, and does away with the expense

TO RELIEVE THE STARVING
What the Berkeley Fritnd* of the llin-

To the Editor of the Callâ Sir: Some liitlt
discrepancies dropped into your items of
Monday last, when referring to the relief work
for the starving people of India.
Berkeley friends of the Hindoos have an am
bition for iÂ«3,000, 000 value in corn and coin
in place of the less amounts named.
Early and generous gifts of money and ma
terial are desired by Christmas, that the
Mayor and his board of managers may send
drafts by cable; that our men of brain and
conscience, now in the field in India, can feel
their hands strengthened and stem the tide of
starvation and death, which causes mothers to
eat the dead bodies of their children.
Arouse! arouse!! ye noble ones of this State
and Nation, and see, know Â«nd enmpreneud
the dire calamity now on 40,000,000 of onr
fellow-men. Tnen tell us if ten times that
sum of $3,000,000 is not needed so soon as
busy hands can gather it.
Men as brave and true as Booth Tucker and
Bishop Thoburn and hosts of others stand
ready to see that no kernel or crumb you help
send them is wasted. Give money, give bank
checks, give your gold and silver ware, both
your goods and household ornaments; givÂ«
your houses, vacant lots and lands to be sold
and the results telegraphed iorward to India.

No Time Will Ba Lost
in Organizing.
Letters and Personal Offers of Assist

the Heac quarters.
Those who have taken the lead in this
City in espousing the cause of the Cuban
patriots are working tooth and nail to get
the matter in proper shape for a mass
meeting, anticipatine a favorable reply to
their letters from General Estrada Palma
of the Cuban Junta in New York.
He hes been asked to sanction the for
mation of a branch of the Junta in this
City and the raising of funds to aid the
Cubans against the forces of Spain.
Yesterday was a busy day at the head
quarters at 2006 Mason street, where
President Jones of the "Cuban sympa
thizers" met and talked with a large num
ber of men who called for information.
The majority of the visitors were anxious
to know what the chances of a force of.
volunteers going to Cuba from this City
were, and many expressed a willingness
to go to the island and cast their fortunes
with the brave leaders who are combat
ting the men of General Weyler.
In all instances the volunteers were told
that all depended on the sanction which
is daily expected from Estrada Palma,
and that if that leader is favorable to the
project the local club will go ahefd and
raise not 'only funds but a force of fight
ing men.
Secretary Mascherini said last evening
that the encouragement already received
had exceeded the expectations of the sym
pathizers with the patriots, and that

the majority of the people of San Fran
cisco and of California are in sympathy
with Cuba, and when we can

HOLIDAY SPECTACLES,
The Christmas Attractions Are AH
Going Smoothly and Christmas Mati
nees Are Everywhere Announced.
All the holiday attractions have had the
benefit of a few days' run and are now
poing quite smoothly. The coryphees are
sure of thpir steps, the machinery is run
ning on oiled wheels and the actors' lines,
which halted here and there on some of
the opening nights, are now rattled off in
dependently of the prompter.
At the Baldwin "The Brownies" has
been enlivened by some local hits, which
arouse a good deal of laughter. New
house and Waffle, the clever guitar and
mandolin players, continue to be one of
the chief attractions of the performance,
and tne German band, in spite of its dis
cordant strains, is nightly encored.
Judging from the attendance at the Co
lumbia the Frawley Company has made
quite a hit in "The Railroad of Love."
The play is bright and sparkling and it is
acted in a spirited manner.
"The Cricket on the Hearth" is provine
a seasonable offering at the Alcazar. May
Buckley is a quaint little figure as Dot,
and she acts her role very prettily. Mrs.
Bates is excellent as the eccentric Tilly
Slow boy, and the rest of the cast is quite
satisfactory.
"She" meets all the requirements of
patrons of the Grand. This remark does
not apply solely to the lady who plays
She. but to the version of the novel
dramatized by Edwin Barbour. It is
spectacular, contains startling moments
and has a riotous element of fun, provided
principally by an irrepressible Hibernian.
The spectacular effects are well produced,
particularly the scene depicting the land
ing on the beach, and the company does
good work all through the performance.
"Jack and the Beanstalk" is proving a
strong attraction at the Tivoli. Its spec
tacular effectÃ are brilliant, the music is
bright and the dialogue is full of fun.
These combined qualities are meeting
with tieir reward in large houses.
The ballets at the Orpheum have im
proved greatly in smoothness and finish
since the opening night and are now do
ing excellent work. The clever Phoite
Company continues to be one of the chief
attractions oi the strong Christmas bill.
Special Christmas day matinees are an
nounced at all the theaters.
AN ATTRACTIVE EXHIBIT.
The throngs of holiday sightseers
made the entrance of the Bay City Market,
1138-1146 Market street, nearly impassable
yesterday afternoon. The occasion was the
crand display of fine meats at this popular
market, which it is admitted surpasses
every former effort. Here are grizzly and
cinnamon bears of enormous proportions,
hundreds of mammoth cattle selected from
the choicest feeding grounds in California
and Nevada, sheep in endless rows, fanci
fully dressed calves, tiny lambs, huge
porkers from H. W. Meeks of Sen Lorenzo
which tip the beam at 1200 pounds, all
flanked by numberless suckling pigs.
T eso are arranged by a master hand to
please the eye and tempt the appetite.
Sugar-cured hams and bacon cured under
the personal supervision of Mark Strouse
Â»t his immense packing-house on the San
Bruno road, kettle- rendered lard which
has an established reputation of beine the
best in the market, sausages of all kinds,
making in all of its display of fresh and
malted meats one of the best markets west
of Chicago.
Mr. Strouse is recognized as one of the
foremost business men in his line in this
City, and the steadily increasing popular
ity of his market is a tribute to his busi
ness methods.

Gun Club held a meeting last evening at
the club on Van Ness avenue, at which it

CHARLES MAYNE'S WILL.
Xotice of Contest Piled by the Dead
Man's Relatives.
Notice of contest of the will of the late
Charles Mayne, alias Merzbach, was filed
in the office of the County Clerk yester
day.
The contestants are Simon Louis and
Leopold Merzbach, Ernestine Birkner and
Rosalie Goldsmith, first cousins of the de
ceased. Their father was Charles Merz
bach,-a brother of the father of the testa
tor. The will was admitted to probate in
December of last year.
The contestants ask that the order ad
mitting it to probate be revoked on the
ground that deceased was incapacitated
from making a will and that he was un
duly influenced by Mrs. Louise R. Barroil
het, wife of Henry Barroilhet, to whom
he left the greater part of his estate, and
who was appointed executrix of the will.
The estate was appraised at $557,688 40.
Several benevolent institutions were be
queathed liberal sums. The relatives of
the dead man think they were discrimin
ated against and will try to get a share of
the estate. ,
TO FIND II BLINDFOLDED
A Man Offers to Trace the
Course of a Gold Ledge
in This City.
If Led to the Spot He Could Solve the
Mystery of Anderson's
Rich Find.
Anderson, the man who has discovered
in a street in this City what, from a lim
ited inspection and a careful assay of
samples, he believes to be a very rich
ledge of gold-bearing quartz, is not with
out callers who are willing to help him
solve the problem of how to prospect and
develop the mine. He is at a loss what to
do, but these persons all have a sugges
tion to offer. The discoverer persistently
guards bis secret. He will not let drop a
hint of where to look for the hidden
ledge.
Among his visitors last night was a
man who discoursed learnedly upon the
peculiarities of quartz veins and of other
geological formations. He had had con
siderable experience himself in locating
ledees and to his sorrow ha I located one
almost to the exclusive profit of one of
California's : millionaires, but with small
satisfaction to himself. His method was
unique. He had but to be led to the spot
under. which the ledge was supposed to be
and then while blindfolded he could walk
unerringly along the surface, describing
the precise course of the unseen ledge.
Furthermore, he could . stop over the
places where the ledge was richest.
Though the discoverer was encouraged
by this information he would not avail
himself of the method, because it required
primarily a disclosure of the location of
the outcroppings of the rich vein.
A property -owner, mindful of Auder
son's employment at building houses in
different parts of the City, surmised that
Anderson must have discovered the mine|
while laying a server to one of the new
buildings. He figured it out, compared
dates and surmised : that, perhaps, the
mine had been found right next to a lot
he owns on Jersey street. Possibly his
own property rich in gold.
But Anderson destroyed this brief vision
of wealth yesterday by explaining that he
discovered the ledge by chance while
strolling along a certain street some time
between August 15, his birthday, and
October 19,. the day on which his : brother
started for Sweden. More exactly than
that he cannot fix the day, but during all
that time he says he was not engaged
upon any building, nor was he at work
anywhere.
Anderson still has hopes. , If he cannot
touch the wealth, he thinks there ought
to be some way by which the City : can
profit by the mine and give men work if
investigations prove the ledge to be ex
tensive ana as rich as the first assay.

A Sailor Drowned.
Frano Bajuoen, a Finland sailor, fell off the
Harrison-street wharf yesterday morning and
was drowned. Those who witnessed the acci
dent stated that the sailor was drunk and that
he struck bis head on a projection from a phe
before he reached tne water. Several men
rushed to secure ropes to rescue the man, but
he was dead before help could reach him. His
body was taken to the Morgue. Deceased was
22 years of age.

It will thus be seen that between last

Hall is ahead in the race.
There was a small scare on the ferry

REMBOLD'S TROUBLE THICKENS.
-
Ordered to Produce Mrs. Parsons' Will
or Make an Explanation.
Attorney G. A. Rembold is likely to
have an unpleasant half hour with Judge
Slack next Tuesday, as he has been
ordered to produce the will of the late
Mrs. Sarah M. .Parsons at that time or to
show cause why he has not done so. As
Mr. Remboid lias asserted that he sent the
will to Savannah, Ga., Mrs. Parsons'
former residence, several days ago, he
may hava some difficulty in complying
with the court's order. The opinion
among lawyers is that the best thing Mr.
Rembold can do is to confess that he was
not acquainted with the requirements of
the code, throw himself on the mercy of
the court and try to get the people in
Georgia to send the will back to San
Francisco in order that it may be ad
mitted to probate.
Philip H. Maas has filed application to
be appointed administrator of vhe estate.
He alleges that the legatees under
the will are P. H. Idaas, Elizabeth
Katherine Mass, Dr. W. H. Mayo, G.
A. Rembold, of this City, and several
friends and relatives of the deceased I'v
ing in Georgia. Among the latter is Dr.
S. C. Harris, widower of the testator, who
is named for a legacy of only $5. Miss Maas
is designated as the residuary legatee.
Mr. ReniDold's connection with the es
tate grew out of the fact that he drew the
lady's will, for which service he is accused
of having taken possession of about $10,
-000 worth of jewelry and clothing, besides
receiving $500 in the will.
FILLMORE STREET
GLOWS IN LIGHT
Celebration of the Newly
Acquired Illuminating
System.
Paper Lanterns, Fireworks and
Music "Testified to the Joy
of the Peop'e.
The Street on the High Bill Ablazs
With the Symbols of the
Spirit cf Progress.
Passengers coming over from Oakland
last evening, and pedestrians downtown,
observed a rosy glow in the western iky
above the top of the big hill that divi ;es
the Western Addition from the eastern
part of the City. This glow had all the
appearance of a block of wooden build
ings on fire. Then sparks were seen to
rise gracefully in the air, little buds of fire
that blossomed into stars of a pale blue
ish white surrounded by a corona of gray
smoke with an opalascent suggestion of
violet.
But the fire-bells failed to startle the
quiet warm air of a San Francisco De
cember night with the mellow melan
choly tones of alarm, and the lookers
wondered at the glare and at the silence
that accompanied it.
It was not a fire in the destructive sense,
but it was the reflection of" the fire of prog
ress and enterprise with which Fillmore
street, from Sutter to Pacific, was illumi
nated. Paper lanterns from far Cathay
and from the street of the dancing-girls in
Yokohama, whence Sir Edwin Arnold
drew some of his Oriental inspiration,
hung from the eavea of the awnings in
double rows, and added their golden glow
worm glow to the dazzling brilliancy of
the electric lamps.
Fillmore street eclipsed all its prede
cessors in the way of celebrating the in
troduction of the midair arc lamps. Ninth
street on the previous night had had a
similar celebration, and it wda a timely
pointer for the merchants of Fiilrnore
street, for they added a few mere scallops
and literally burned up all their com
petitors.
The band wagon was drawn by four
spirited horses with nodding plumes, and
behind it followed a procession of delivery
wagons gayly decorated with bunting
and lanterns. The band in soulful
strains declared that wnen the Fillmore
street merchant "Walked <iat levee round,
round, round, dat new bully was nowhar
to be found, found, found" in the way of
competition.
Bonfires blazed in order to make the
story of the evolution of light more com
plete, beginning with the chapter of the
dry twigs rabbed together starting the
bonfire, passing thence to the candle in the
lantern, while the sickly glare ol the stn-et
lamp on the corner typified the next step,
that of gas. and above them all the mag
nificent arc light overhead picturing in
miniature the dory of the sun.
Koraan candles, fountains of fire, batter
ies of stars and vagrant comet * filled the
night sky with â  wavering glare and threw
pleasing variations of light and shade

THE SUPERVISORS
REFUSE TO AID
Will Not Build a Sewer
System at the County
Hospital.
No Funds Are Available for
Such a Purpose at the
Present Time.
Dr. Stahle Intimates That the Insti
tution May Ba Closed to tha
Indigent Sick.
Chairman Taylor of the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervi
sors told Dr. Stahle, superinten
dent of the City and County Hos
pital, plainly yesterday that the City
could not and would not furnish the funds
for the new sewer system for the institu
tion which the Board of Healtn demands.
Dr. Stahle appeared before the committee
with Chief Plumbing Inspector Sullivan
to urge that something be done at once to
better the sanitary condition of the hos
pital.
He said that an epidemic of typhoid
fever or other contagious or infectious
diseases was liable to break out at
any moment, owing to the mass of
sewage and filth that the broken and dis
jointed pipes had allowed to flow under the
building. In fact, cases of typhoid had
already developed and no one was safe
from disease. There were no funds avail
able for the purpose at his disposal, he
saiii, and the Supervisors must do some
thing. Supervisor TayJor answered that
there were absolutely no funds in the City
Treasury that could be used for the new
system, and that while there was no doubt
that the matter needed immediate atten
tion there was no help for it.
"Well," said Dr. Btahle, "if an epidemic
breaks out the Supervisors will nave to
answer for it. The hospital in its present
condition is more likely to kill patients
that come out there than to cure them.
"I Buppose we shall have to notify the
people that they cannot be treated there,
for it would be unjust to take a sick man
into the' building. Unless you gentlemen
find some way to fix those sewers we
shall have to fill up the trenches we have
dug to expose the broken pipes, and the
ho-pital will be in as bad condition as it
ever was."
"Can't help it," said Supervisor Taylor,
"maybe our successors will find some way
to furnish you with the money. It seems
curious that the Board of Health, after ail
the money it has received at the hands of
the board, cannot do the work."
The Board of Health condemned the
hospital as unsafe for the purposA for
which it is used and passed a resolution
calling on the (Supervisors or Legislature
to erect a new ana suitable building.
It is probable that, in view of the de
plorable condition of the sewers at tne
institution and the refusal of the Super-
Visors to do anything in the matter, the
nospi'.al will be closed until an appropria
tion can be obtained or a new building
erected.

BANKING LAW CHANGES.
Bank CommJus loner* Prepared to Urge
Them Upon the legislature.
The Bank Commissioners are preparing
to urge upon the Legislature the modifi
cations iv the banking laws of the State
recommended in the annual report of the
Commissioners. These recommendations
have already engaged tne attention of the
Code Commission, and the Bank Com
mission think that the Governor may em
body them in his message to the Legisla
ture. Bank Commissioner Kilburn called
on the Attorney-General a few days ago
in reference to matters connected with
the commission.
The changes which are proposed have
been commented on Heretofore at some
length, but may be summarized to advan
tage for reference. They are as follows:
Restrict commercial banks to a commer
cial banking business; savings banks
should not be merged with commercial
banks nor commercial banks with savings
banks.
When a bank is declared insolvent a re
ceiver should be appointed by the court
to take charge of the bank while it is in
liquidation.
A majority of the directors of a bank
should oe required to sign such reports as
may be called for by the commission,
their signatures being in addition to those
of the presidentand secretary of the bank.
At least three directors, who are not di
rectly or indirectly interested, should
approve all loans made to officers and
directors of commercial banks. .

THE GRAND JURY
Laborers Who Worked on
the City Hall Have
a Grievance.
' Contractors for the Building 0:
the Dome Failed to Pay
Their Men
Liabilities That Were Not Mentioned
in the Petition in In
solvency.
Fourteen men who put in several
months' labor on the work of building the
done of the City Hall without having rei
ceived their pay have decided to take their
grievances before ttre Grand Jury and get
satisfaction in that way if they can in no
other.
O'Connell & Lewis were the contractors
for the dome, and when their work for the
City municipal building was finished they
were in debr to their men for over $6000,
Borne of the individual claims running up
as high as $:00.
As the firm drew payments on their
contract from time to time, the men
t ought they should receiye at least a
rtion of their money, and as the job
ared completion became clamorous in
thetr demands. At last the work was fin-
ished and turned over to the City Hall
Commissioners and still the men were out
and injured.
Then threats of suit were made and the
men were called to the office of Stafford &
Stafford, the attorneys for the' firm, for a
talk over the matter." Before leaving they
signed an agreement to wait for their
money, the contractors on their part
agreeing to pay within fifteen days at
least $100 on each claim.
Over $4000 of these claims were placed in
the hands of Lange's Collection Agency,
and it is in reference to transactions that
have taken place since tne agency took
the claims that the Grand Jury will be
astfed- to investigate. The attorney who
is handling the matter for the men said
yesterday that the subject was one for in
vestigation, and that the men were deter
mined to push the matter to a conclusion.
"When the men signed the agreement
to wait lor their money," he said, "they
did so in ignorance of a provision of the
law that has since stepped in and barred
them from getting what belongs to them.
' "The law says that claims for labor, in
OTder to be preferred liabilities, must be
incurred within sixty days previous to the
firm or person owing them going into in
solvency. At the time the agreement was
made the firm had not gone into insol
vency and the men's claims took prece
dence over those fur materials.
"Wfth the'a.reenient in their hands the
firm stood the men off until the statutory
time nad elapse :, and then a voluntary
petition in insolvency was filed.
"When we learned how the matter had
b-sen manipulated we went into court and
fi:ed an involuntary petition, and the
question as to which shall stand is still
pending.
'"Tlie assignee question is another mat
ter on which the men have a grievance
and which wiil probabiy be laid before the
Grand Jury.
"When O'Conneli & Lewis' voluntary
petiiion was fiied there was no mention
made in the papers of the liabilities for
.abor, and of course the men have no voice
n the selection of the man who will
-^andie the prorer^y of the firm and pre
sumably try to see tnat all are treated
justly. The law says that when a petition
in insolvency is fiied it must enumerate
all of the creditors and that each shall
receive a notice when and where the elec
tion of an assignee shall take place. Of
course under the circumstances the men
could not be notified by the County Clerk.
"It is doubtful whether under the pres
ent circumstances the laborers, many of
whom are in straitened circumstances,
will' receive what is due them, but a
determined effort will be made to save
something from the wrecs to compensate
them for the work performed."

ALL RATES IN ABEYANCE
The Commission Will Await the
Final Decision of Judge
McKenna.
S:eps Taken to Provide a Uniform
System of Bockk'-ping for Trans
portation Companies.
At the meeting of the Railroad Com
mission yesterday all the members were
present, and the most important action
taken was the determination to await the
final outcome of the case now pending
before Judge McKenna before any further
reduction in rates is made.
Chairman La Rue reported that he had
had a consultation with the Attorney-
General and the other attorneys associated
with him in the case before the United
States Circuit Court, and that he had been
advised that it would not be best at this
stage of affairs for the board to proceed
with the investigation proposed by Com
missioner Stanton.
This investigation had for its object the
eduction of rates charged by the South
ern Pacific Company, other than grain
rates, which are now the subject of litiga
tion. Its scope, as outlined by Stanton,
was to be of the broadest character, and
was to include an expert examination of
all the books of the monopoly which had
any bearing on the subject of rates.
Stanton, despite the joint opinion of the
commission's attorneys, adhered to his
idea that the commission ought to go
ahead and lay the foundation for a reduc
tion of all such rates, freight and passen
ger, which ttiey are not enjoined from
changing by the injunction granted by
Judge McKenna.
La Rue held that such an examination
would necessarily be a part of the trial to
be beid before Judge McKenna in the
final determination of the reasonableness
of tbe 8 per cent reduction on grain rate?,
and stated that (or the board to go into
such an investigation independently
would be a work of supererogation.
Stanton thoueht that the commission
shoi_# employ itself in some way for the
pub.^good, even if it were deemed inad
visaoie to make further reduction of rates
at ibis time. He suggested that steps be
taken to have the Southern Pacific Com
pany arid all transportation companies
adopt a certain system of accounts, one
tnat is prescribed or approved by thi
board. With this object he moved that
the secretary of the board be instructed to
communicate with the officers of all
transportation companies asking them to
conler with the board in regard to the
matter. The motion was adopted.
It was decided that the matter of rail
roads posting all rates of freights and
fares in public be referred to the Attorney-
General. It was the impression ot the
commission that there io a law providing
for this, and they wish to see it enforced.
If there is no such iaw tbe commission
will create one.
There was some discussion in reference
to making all special rates of the Southern
Pacific Company the regular rates, so as to
prevent discrimination in favor of certain
shippers, but no official action was taken.
ANXIOUS TO ANNEX.
Promoters of "Greater Oakland" Will
I* it nil the Matter.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec 23.â A meeting
of those who are anxious to annex the
territory between Oakland and Berkeley
will be held next week to take preliminary
steps necessary to submit the matter to
popular vote.
The lines as now proposed are to begin
at a point on the northern boundary of
the city of Oakland, 150 feet east of tbe
east line of Broadway and running thence
northerly to a point 150 feet east of tne
east line of intersecting line of College
avenue and thence northwesterly 150 feet
distant from College avenue to the south
line of the town of Berkeley, thence along
Buch line and tbe Emeryville line to tbe
nortn line of the ciiy of Oakland, thence to
the point cf beginning.
It is estimated that this territory in
cludes a population of about 7000 souls. It
has three separate schools and a sanitary
district. Tbe Peralta school with three,
the Temescal school with eight and the
Bay School with eight departments gives
some idea of tbe population which would
be added to the Second Ward if the propo
sition prevails. Under the city charter
there can be no redistricting of the wards
before 1900.
Roddy's Handball Court in Litigation
Judge Slack has issued an order restraining
James J. Roddy from removing a French range
and a handball courj. from premises belonging
to Mary McHale.joh Sau Bruuo avenue and
Yolo street. The case will be heard on the Bth
of next month.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1896.
WILL THE THIRD
ATTEMPT SUCCEED
Scheme to Save Three
Burglars From Impend
ing Punishment.
John O'Neal, Under Thirty Years*
Sentence, Comes to Their
Rescue.
He Will Testify in Court That He and
Billy Flannery Committed the
Burglaries.
The police were considerably surprised
yesterday to learn that John O'Neal, who
is serving a term of thirty years in Fol
som penitentiary, had been in the County
Jail for a few days, and their surprise was
intensified when on making inquiry they
ascertained the reason for his temporary
removal from Folsom.
Patrick Kelly, Ed Colvin and W. Cor
bett, three notorious ex-convicts, will ap
pear in Judge Wallace's court on Monday
to stand th lr trial on two charges of
burglary. They are the men who are ac
cused by the police of breaking into the
house of W. S. Duval, 1012 Pine street, on
August 2 and stealing about $1000 worth
of jewelry, and of breaking into the house
of H. J. Hendrick, 1022 Washington street,
a few nights later.
Most of the stolen jewelry was found in
rooms on Grant avenue occupied by Kelly
and Colvin and a woman calling herself
Kelly's wife. Detectives Gibson and
Wren, wlio hay c charge of the case, claim
that they have ample evidence to secure a
conviction. â
Now it seems tnat O'Neal, who is also
an ex-convict and is a friend of the three
prisoners, will on Monday in Judge Wal
lace's court testify that he and Billy Flan
nery, an ex-convict and fugitive from jus
tice, committed the burglaries at the Duval
and Hendrick residences. This testimony
is with the object of securing the dis
missal ot the charges against Kelly, Coi
vin and Corbett.
As soon as this fact became known to
the police diligent inquiry was made, and
it was ascertained that friends of the
three prisoners had been for three or four
weeks going to Folsom penitentiary and
conversing with O'Neal, and they do not
hesitate to say that O'Neal has beer, pre
vailed upon to accept the responsibility
for the burglaries because he has tnirty
years to serve and if he were convicted of
perjury any additional sentence would
not worry him.
O'Neal was the mar. who smashed the
window in H. Wachhorst's jeweirv-store
on J street, Sacramento, September 18,
and stole a trayful of diamonds. He was
pursued and captured and gave the name
of Frank Holden, but he was afterward
identified as O'Neal, and having two prior
convictions for robbery he was
sentenced to thirty years. On Oc
tober 6, 1886, he was sentencei to
ten years in Folsom for robbery
in San Joaquin County, but was pardoned
on September 3, 1889. A few nights later
he held up and robbed Policeman I. T.
Bean in the rear of the Mint, and on No
vember 27 he was sentenced to five years
in Folsom. He is now 36 years of age.
Billy Flannery, who O'Neal says v/as his
companion in the Duval and Hendrick
burglaries, Is wanted by the police for
grand larceny. He secuied bonds after
his arrest last September, one of his bonds
men being L. C. Burton, 1426 Jackson
street. He showed his appreciation of
Burton's uiminess by breaking into his
house on September 13. along with Wil
liam McElroy. and stealing a quantity of
jewelry. McElroy was chased and cap
tured, but Flannery escaped and since
then lie has Kept away from the City.
Kelly, Colvin and Corbett have twice
made an attempt to regain their liberty
since being arrested last August. While
in the City Prison awaiting their prelim
inary examination they concocted a dar
ing scheme to escape with the assistance
of Kelly's wife. By some means or ot er
she was able to get a duplicate of the
key to the prison door and it had been ar
ranged to make the attempt during the
police parade in October, but the prison
officials learned of the scheme and frus
trated the attempt. Two or three weeks
ago they made another attempt to escape
from the County Jail, but were unsuc
cessful.
As they have found that they cannot
escape by breaking jail, tha police believe
that their friends have now hit upon the
sch-erae to net O'Neal to swear in court
that, he and Flannery committed the
burglaries. ______________
THIRD-STREET LIGHTS.
Merchants and Property-Owners Are
United on the First Block.
Third street, with old-time pride as
being a business street before some of the
streets that are now forging ahead as
prosperous mercantile centers were heard
of. is not going to yield its position in the
downtown section as being a storekeeper's
thoroughfare; and in order to convince
the public of this fact negotiations are
now under way by which this street will
be illuminated from Market to Mission
just as soon as the elec:ric-light company
can get tue arc lamps in place.
The prime movers in this progressive
stride are B. Katcuinski of the Pniladel
ohia Shoestore, at No. 10; Pasch, Baer &
Co., Eagle Snoestore, at No. 26, and Hugo
Keil, property-owner of several stores
lurther south.
Tliose gentlemen have started a sub
scription list among the storekeepers on
this" block, and it has met with every en
couragement.
Fourth street, from Market to Folsom,
will be subject to the electric current,
which will slied its ray of arc lights on
this street by the evening of the last day
of the year 1896.
Tiiis is the promise made by the elec
tric-light company to John T. Sullivan of
the Pioneer Shoestore on Fourth street
yesterday.
Valencia and Sixteenth streets in the
Mission are also on waiting orders with
the same light-giving power and with
similar promises that before tha dawn oi
1897 the current will be turned on along
those lines.
Larkin street, from Sntter to Market, is
patiently waiting its turn to have a grand
nurrah night, but so far the committee
has nothing positive as to the night when
darkness will disappear before the electric
rayi from the arc lamps.
The next street to be heard from is
Market. The merchants on this thor
oughfare have so iar made no move in
adding additional lights to their stores.
If they have contemplated dome anything
in this line the nature of it has not so far
been publicly discussed. No doubt, how
ever, a movement will be made soon
and on a grand scale, as becoming the
dignity of the principal commercial street
of not only' San Francisco but the Pacific
Coast.
Little SUt*rs f Infant Shelter.
The Little Sisters' Infant Shelter will have
its Christmas lestival in the home at 512
Minna street on Wednesday next, commenc
ing at 1 o'clock in tbe afternoon. The manage
ment announce* that it would be pleased to
receive donations of fruit, cakes or anything
that would make glad the hearts of the little
ones on the day when all look forward to
enjoyment and luppiness.

FIGHT FOR THE
AERIAL BALLET
Rival Theatrical People in
the United States
Court.
C. S. Nilsson Says the Brownies
Have No Right to Use
His Patent.
Palmer Cox Fo'ks Say That the
Apparatus in Question Was Used
Many Years Ago.
The case of Carl 8. Nilsson against the
managers of the Palmer Cox Brownies
Company and tbe managers of the Bald
win Theater was taken up yesterday
morning before Judge McKenna in the
United States Circuit Court on an order
to show cause why the defendants should
not be restrained from using certain pat
ented stage machinery known as aerial
ballet apparatus. Nilsson has an aerial
ballet at the Orpheum and the Palmer
Cox Brownies Company is giving a simi
lar production at the Baldwin Theater.
The case was presented to Judge Mc-
Kenna in affidavits" by people who know,
or are supposed to know, all about the
apparatus in question. The affidavit of
Mr. Nilsson sets forth that he is a me
chanic and that several years ago he pat
ented apparatus used for the purpose of
presenting to the public a ballet-dancer
who would appear to be dancing in mid
air; that it jj constructed of puilies, ropes,
wires, etc. He asserts that all of these
were surreptivioualy duplicated by the de
fendants while in New York and have
been and are feeing used to his detriment
and causing him great loss on his patent.
His affidavit is substantiated by one
sworn to by Julian Kialto, who asserted
that the ballet machinery in use at the
Baldwin is an exact copy of Nilsson's in
vention, and that it was built by the de
fendant? and concealed in the basement
of the Fourteenth-street Theater, New
York.
Upon the presentation of these docn
ments Attorney J. J. Scriver asked that
the defendants be enjoined from further
use of the apparatus. He said his client
would give a bond for damages pending
the litigation.
Attorney Fred'rich for the defendants
asserted tnat he had something to present
for his client* that would probably change
the complexion of the case. He read
affidavits of a number of theatrical people
who assert that the apparatus was in
general use in theaters long before Nils
son laid claim to its origin.
One was Robert J. Cutler, a machinist
in the Brownie company, who stated that
back in the early part of 1882 a ballet was
produced in a New York theater that had
a run of sixty consecutive nights in which
the aerial feature was introduced. As
early as 1873 he saw in Booth's Theater,
New York, a productiontsimilar to that of
the Brownies. The deponent asserted
that he had frequently constructed similar
devices for similar purposes, for the main
principle was that of a moving crane, such
as is used for moving hay or other heavy
or bulky bodies.
Malcomb Douglas, who composed the
music for tbe Brownies and advance agent
for the same companies, stated that the
company has produced this attraction 111
all of the principal cities of the East and
in Montreal, and that frequently in some
ot tne cities Nilsson produced ballets sim
ultaneously with the Brownies and both
used similiar apparatus.
In none of these places did Nilsson at
tempt to enjoin the company from using
the apparatus, nor did he lay claim to
any patent involving the principles upon
which the aerial feature wa3 produced.
Florie Clements, one of the Brownie
company, made a similar affidavit.
The affidavit of Lillian Beck, of the
snmfl company, was in substance that she
knew 01 the aerial ballet boing used in a
London theater in "The Golden Fly," and
that while in New York Nilsson told her
that the feature was not new, as he had"
seen it in London and Parip years before.
The affidavit of Alfred Bouvier, man
ager of the Baldwin Theater, was that be
is simply engaged oy the Palmer Cox
Company and has no interest in tne litiga
tion. He was named as one of the de
fendants.
As there will be a number of counter
affidavits presented the case was con
tinued to next Monday morning.
SHOT HIS ENEMY.
Two Men, Who Were Once Partners.
Meet and Quarrel in East
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 23. â Lloyd C.
Harlow and E. C. Careens, who were
formerly in the coal business as partners,
met this afternoon in East Oakland, and
Harlow shot twice at Carstens. One of
the buliets missed, the other hit the right
Bide, but merely made a flesh wound.
There ba-s been bad blood between the
two men for a year. The conditions ex
isting between the two men can best be
learned from their own stories.
After Harlow' s arrest he said: "Carstens
has Deen hounding me for a year. He
once drew a knife on me in my own
house. A couple of months ago he fol
lowed me 09 Park street from the station
to Denison street with a knife in his
hand, but I faced him and drove him
away. I went to William Peterson, lor
whom he was working, and told him to
keep the man away trom me or I would
shoot him. Peterson told me not to
mind, as the fellow was not responsible
for what he did.
"To-day I was walking on East Twelfth
street when 1 saw him. As he approached
me he began to leel in his pocket as if to
get a knife or other weapon. I drew my
revolver and called on him to Mop. He
kept advancing, but "When I called halt toe
third time I tired.
"He advanced, although I hit him, and
I fired a second shot, which missed him."
Carsten's story is very different as re
gards the attempted murder. Harlow
once had Dim arrested for disturbing the
peace, but the case was dismissed, "lwas
going along East Fourteenth street." said
Carstens, after his wound was treated,
"when I met Harlow. He once drew a
knife on me on the street. To-day, when
he got about twenty-five feet from me he
pulled out his pistol and said, 'Stop.' He
then commenced to firo and shot twic*.
"As soon as I could I got away. I didn't
think 1 was shot at first, but my s-ide felt
peculiar, and when I looked at my coat I
saw a bul'et hole in it. I went up to Dr.
Foster's office and he examined me. The
bullet did not go in very far. I never gave
the man any cause to do this to me. lam
a man of family, over 60 years of age and
have always borne a good reputation."
Harlow is charged with assault to mur
der.

CELEBRATED THE
OHIO CRUSADES
Exercises by the Women's
Christian Temperance
Union.
Prayers for Temperance Uttered
in Many Churches Last
Evening.
Mrs. Luse, State President, Hopes tor
U timate Success Before tbe
Century's Close.
Just twenty-three years ago yesterday
the first temperance crusade took place in
Ohio. Barrels of beer and whisky were
rolled out into the streets by temperance
women, 'who, with axes, beating the
heads of liquor casks in, let the intoxicat
ing fluids flow into the street. Then the
women sang hymns and prayed for the
aivine blessing upon their work.
Yesterday in many tsities of the United
States memorial services were held in
commemoration , and celebration of
this event. Some of these celebrations
took place in the assembling- place:) of
local unions of the- Women's Christian
Temperance Union; otuers were held in
churches, and in the servicea officers of
the Women's Christian Temperance Union
took a leading part.
Some days ago the Central Union of the
organization in this City asked the Minis
terial Union to assist in celebrating the
anniversary. So several churches at the
regular Wednesday evening meetings re
sponded to the exhortations to go on with
the temperance work in this City and
State, in pursuance of the spirit of the
tirsl cru.sade which led to the organiza
tion of the Women's Christian Temper
ance Union.
The Central Union met yesterday after
noon at 132 McAllister street. Mrs. fl. H.
Luse, president of the Central Union and
also State president of the Women's
Christian Temperance Union, presided.
Mrs. Smith, who was one of the original
crusaders in Ohio, related her experience
upon the occasion of the first crusade.
While they were kneeling in the snow
praying a man threw cold water over an
old lady who was of the party. They did
not retaliate, and the man noticed this
and subsequently became one of the cru
saders.
Mrs. Dorcas J. Spencer, who delivered
the first address for the crusaders at Grass
Valley, in this State, aiso spoke. She re
lated that her husband and her six chil
dren were in the procession in Grass Val
ley that opened the proceedings, Mrs.
Spencer is now the State secretary of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union
and one of its most enthusiastic
workers.
Many prominent workers were present.
Last evening Mrs. Luse conducted a meet
ing at the First Christian Church on
Twelfth street, of which Rev. Frank S.
Ford is pastor. Nearly all who were pres
ent, young and old alike, spoke in favor of
temperance and the prayers were devoted
to the work.
Miss Mary E. Barker, one of the State
officers, of San Jotie, spoke at the First
Congregational Church.
Mrs. Luse said last evening that she had
hign hopes for the extension oi the work
of the crusaders. She beiieved that in all
the evangelical churches the worshipers
would encourage the lemperance csuse.
"I believe," said Mrs. Luse earnestly,
"that before 1900 our work will be accom
plished." Other workers said that they
shared her belief.
STOLE DRESSED MEAT.
Three Employes of L,. I) Stone ft Co.,
Batchers, Arrested.
Charles Gross, an employe of Leon D.
Stone <ft Co., the Sixth-street butchers,
swore to a complaint in Judge Joachim
sen's court yesterday morning charging
William O'Farrell. James O'Leary and
Richard Mow.cry with petty larceny.
For the past eight months the firm had
been cognizantof the fact that large quan
tities cf dressed meat had been systemati
cally stolen from the shop. They placed
the matter in the bands of the Pinkerton
detective agency and a watch was placed
on the premises. It was discovered that
meat was passed through a trapdoor lead
ing into the basement of ar. adjoining
saloon, whence it was removed at a con
venient opportunity.
The three men were arrested yesterday
and locked up in the City Prison.

IN EARLY MORN
Thirty- Five Young Folks
to Come to Oakland on
a Special Car.
With Sleighbel s and Song They
Will Announce Christmas
Day.
Miss Jean Hmh of Fruitvale Has
Deci'eJ to Carry Oat an
Old- Time Id a.
Oakland Office can Francisco Call,)
SJOB Broadway, Dec. 23. >
A few families who are fortunate enough
â¢to be in the local blue book will have an
old-time English Christmas treat early on
Friday morning. Before the sun rises a
band of little carolers will sine under the
windows of some of the large houses at
Fruit vale and on Jackson street, after
â which they will return to the beautiful
Hush residence at Etnamere, Fruitvale,
where they will be rewarded for their ef
forts with a handsome Christmas tree and
other entertainment.
iThe introduction of Christmas caroling
into Oakland is the idea of Miss Jean
Hush. Several months ago s c decided to
organize a little band of carolers, and her
. flesiro was put into practice about six
weeks ago. She got together tnirty-five
little boys and girls and commenced teach
ing them suitable carols. They have prac
ticed regularly until now they are pro
' nounced perfect.
At 2 o'clock Christmas morning the lit
tle band will meet at the Hush home, and
after partaking of some refreshments they
will start out on their singing tour. Some
of the carols are accompanied with sleigh
bell and others with violin, and the eff ct
is very novel. When the residents in
.Fruitvale are awakened from their first
â¢ sleep by the jingling or bells and the sweet
tones o; three dozen merry childish voices
they will know that Christmas is at hand,
and that the little band has come to sing
their first welcome to the glad day.
â¢ A special car has been provided by the
Hay wards electric road, and after the lit
tle singers have carried out their Fruit
vale programme they will take their
sleigbbells and â¢ their violins and their
voices to some of the aristocratic resi
dences in the Lakeside district and before
the regular car service lor the day begins
they will be repeating their Christmas
songs beneath other windows.
Miss Hush will lead the little band, and
when daylight appears they will return to
Ktbnamere, where a large Christmas tree
and a live Santa Claus will reward them
for their trouble. The little ones entered
their worn enthusiastically and consider
the event as one which they are all proud
to take part in.
One of -the prettiest carols, especially
written for the occasion, is as follows:
I will tell you a w onderf ul story,
A ato.y of long ago,
Of a beautiiul star tnat shone from aboi#
On a ball- in a manger low;
How shepuerd.i in fur-oil Judea

em Pacitic ro d regarding the building of J
a tunnel beneath the estuary rather than j
tne construction of the proposed steel i
bridge. Mr. Crocker stated t at if after |
due consideration a tunnel was deemoci j
best that course wonld be followed. He
believes, however, that the cost of a
tunnel including the rijrht of wav ap
proaches would be so icreat as to make it
pructically impossible at this time. A !
tunnel would probably cost $500,000, j
while the proposed steel bridge will cost
$80,000.

TO SUCCEED RICHARDSON
Already There Is Talk of Who
Will Take the Professor's
Place.
S B. Morse, D.D., So Far the Most
Prominent Candidate in
ths Field.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 23.â Hardly
had the report of the death in Athens of
Dr. George M. Richardson, associate pro
fessor of archaeology at the State Univer
sity, been confirmed before speculation as
to who should be his successor began to
j arise.
The most likely man thus far men
tioned seems to be Dr. S. B. Morse, who was
president of California College for ten
; years, until last August, when he resigned
I to spend a period in retirement, travel
and study. Dr. Morse has several inti
mate friends among the Regents, chief
among whom *s Governor Budd, whom he
married while pastor of the Stockton
Baptist Church, and with whose family he
has been very intimate for many years.
That his name will receive much consid
eration by the Regents there seem 3to De
no question.
Tiie poaition which has been made
vacant at B rkeley is one of much impor
| tance and involves considerable respon
sibiiity. To fill it to the best advantage
the professor must necessarily have had
a thorough academic education as well as
the advantage of extensive travel and
research among the ruins of the ancient
! cities and towns of Europe and the
â  Orient. It is not an easy matter to decide
: upon a man who has 'both professional
; ability and the advantage of extensive
trnve!.
Dr. Richardson, having been a man of
means, travel and study were bis privi
leges to any degree he wished.
Dr. Morse, the only candidate men
: tioned thus far, is widely known as an
| educator on this coast, having been di
| rectly or indirectly connected with col
| ipge work for the past twenty-five years.
]He is a native of Kennebe-; County,
j Maine, and a graduate ol Colby Univer
i sity. from which he receive*! the degree
A.M. in 1871 and D.D. in ISB6. For three
years he was professor of Latin and
Grtek in Livonia College. Kenmckv, five
j years professor of Greek in the Pacific
Methodist College, and for ten years
president of the California Co'lege, High
land Park, East Oakland, from which
position be resigned last August.
Dr. Morse has traveled extensively in
the Ea*t, having spent 1877 in Egypt and
the Orient, making archaeology his special
study. The monuments and ruins alone
the Nile, <he cities and tombs of Palestine,
I the temples of Baalbec, the Roman in
ncriptions at Abalene and throughout the
Lebanon Range, all came under his critical
eye. He aiso visited Cesnola, while he

tne other historic cities of Europe.
Dr. Morse spent some lime last year at
the Metropolitan Museum, Central Park,
New York, with General Cesnola, who is
now at the head of that institution. He
Has been contemplating for several weeks
past a trip, together with Dr. Lorimer of

THREATENS TO
EXPOSE "THE PUSH"
Four Dollars Apiece and
â¢Costs Will Save a
Huge Scandal.
Aristocratic Democrats Attacked
by Those Who Beat Them
at Last Convention.
An Awlul Rod Is H:ld Ov?r the Heads
of Those Who Try to "Cinch"
in Politics.
Oaklaxd Office San Francisco Call, )
908 Broadway, D c 23. j
Oaklanders may soon learn the legal
definition of "the push" in politics. At
torney Abbott, of counsel for the old Demo
cratic County Committee, has made an aw
ful threat. He has declared in a document
placed on file in the Superior Court that
if his clients are pushed to the wall and
made to disgorge $4 apiece and costs to
pay for the music that charmed Oakland
when James H. Budd visited it prior to
his election that he will "resist the pay
ment of an attempted cinch organ by the
push, sometimes known as the 'gang,'
composed of political roustabouts who are
usually connected with newspapers, for all
there is in it, and in this behalf should
plaintiff fail to identify the push the
names will be given."
This is very terrible. The old Demo
cratic committee is very aristocratic, and
the thought that they should attempt to
shift the responsibilities onto the "push"
is very unchivalrous.
Who is "the push?" Democratic poli
ticians have long had ideas of their own
in this regard, but now that Mr. Abbott
declares that ''the push" are "political
roustabouts" who "attempt cinches" and
who are in politics "for all there is in it,"
it would be a very serious matter to go
beyond the record and give identity to
that which Mr. Abbott has clothed with
faint shadows.
One of the largest creditors of the old
Democratic Commiitee was the Oakland
Times, 'or advertising Democratic meet
ings. Jn previous years the Times had
not forced payment for various reasons,
and in the Budd campaign evidently the
Democratic Committee thought that pa
per should be magnanimous. But printers
and reporters also went into court one
day, tied up the historic Times, and
proved that magnanimity, even when
shown toward a Budd committee, cannot
run newspapers. This is how it happened
that the Times is one of the largest credi
tors and that its present owners want
their money.
There are only a few Democrats in this
county, but, uniortunately for themselves,
they are divided into half a dozen fac
tions. There is the Moffitt-Laymance con
tingent, the Fitzaerald-Brosnahan wing,
the John P. Irish division, the English
coterie, the McPike following in Ala
meda, and W. W. Foote, who goes it
alone. The present highly disgraceful
spectacle is really the Fitzgerald force?
against the Layinance cohorts, and in the
list of defendants for whom Attorney
Abbott appears the names of Mr. Lay
mance, the Englishes and their friends, do
not appear. In the face of Mr. Abbott's
MRS. M. A. McQUESTEN, an Honoraty Member cf Puerto del
Oro Lodge, Daughters of the American Revolution, Wash
ington, D. C, Who Celebrated Her Ninetieth Birthday in
Alameda Yesterday.
threat, the answer of these other defend
ants is eagerly awaited. Can it mean
that they are "the push" ?
But while all these trained politicians
are making capital out of tlieir past dis
sensions the tact remains the same that
the fireworks are not paid for.that the mu
sicians have not yet been settled with and
the advertising bills not yet paid. While
it may be very interest ns* for these warring
remnants of Democracy to go into court
and make all manner of disclosures about
eacii other, the anxious creditors wouid
rather have their coin.
And all this because the one hundred
county committeemen would not dig up
$4 apiece.

MOKE TOBACCO SAISED.
Several Fine Experiments Have Been
Concluded at San Lorenzo Kauch.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 23.â For several
months extensive experiments in the
raising of tobacco Lave been made in this
county. A few weeks ago a report was
printed of the developments at San Le
andro. Now San Lorenzo has made a re
port which is of great interest in view ot
the fact that the extensive cultivation of
tobacco in this county will probaDly be at
once undertaken.
Experiments were made at the farm of
E. O. Webb to determine the varieties
which grow best in this locality, it having
been already proved that the soil would
grow almost any kind. Reina de Suma
tra, Brazilian Vuelta de Abajo, Partidas, a
Turkish brand and Zimmer's Spanish were
planted quite late in the season. The Cu
ban variety and the Persian cigar weed
made a very poor showing. All the others
made very good growth and had they had
the advantage ol the early rains would have
yielded a heavy crop.
The Spanish brand made a most ex
traordinary growth, considering the un
favorable conditions it had to contend
with, not having been planted until the
middle of June. It nevertheless produced
leaves two feet long and ten inches broad
at the widest part. This latter variety is
a favorite one for cigars and enters largely
into the composition of many so-called
pure Havanas.
The growing of the tobacco is only a be
ginning and a small feature in its prepara
tion for the market. On adobe soil tne
brands grown are too rich in nicotine, but
tnis can be removed by observing certain
will-understood rules. After drying the
leaves they are packed away in tubs and
boxes and subjected for a year to what is
called a "sweat." The crop from Mr.
Webb's place, after having been carefully
inspected and found to be of uood qual
ity, has been packed away, and next fail
it will doubtless be discovered that the
leaf and the manner of curing, as well as
the air of this locality, are all favorable.
MERCHANTS ARE ROUSED
Leavitt's Water- Front Bill Is
Regarded With Very Grave
Suspicion.
Board of Trade and Merchants' Ex
change Call a Special Meeting
to Discuss It-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 23. f
The Merchants' Exchange and the
Board of Trade have called a meeting of
their directors to take action in regard to
the water-front bill which Assemblyman
Leavitt says he proposes to introduce
into the next Legislature. The meeting
will be held in the rooms of the Mer
chants' Exchange in the Central Bank
building at 2 p. m., and Mr. Leavitt will
be invited to be present to answer some
questions regarding the bill.
The Enquirer to-night publishes the
following editorial regarding this import
ant matter:
The question at issue now is not who
shall own or improve the water front â
the city or the State â out whether it shall
be wrenched out of the grasp of the
monopoly which has held it for forty-four
years and absolutely prevented its im
provement. We have spent four years of
time and considerable money in trying to
abolish this monopoly by obtaining a de
cison that the water front is public prop
er, v, not privat-v, we have fought the ca c
through the lower courts and it is now un
der submission in the Supreme Court of
California, awaiting decision.
A bill is proposed which would take
away the title asserted by the city, and de
prive the city of all standing in court,
thereby nullifying all the work done so
far and requiring the contest to be started
over again. On this statement who can
f.ul to see thnt the propos::l, if persisted
in after it* effects have been explained,
must bo the work of the enemy, anu in
tended to keepthe water front in the hands
of the private monopoly and away from
both the city and State? If ttie State
c raid be depended on to fight against tho
corporation for the water frontâ which it
cannot â the only effect of the measure
would be to necessitate beginning all over
again and to confirm the private monopoly
for four or tive years more.
When the water-front battle which i 3
now on has been won the State can retake
the property if it chooses; it will be pub
lic property whether in the hands of the
State or of the city. But it must first be

OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 23.â The com
mittee of twenty-one appointed by the Re
publican City Central Committee a few

be a meeting next Tuesday evening, at
which the delegates will be named. W.

CURE FOR RHEUMATISM.
New Method of Treating That Painful
Disease.
An exhibition was made last evening
before the County Medical Society at its
scientific meeting of a new method of
treating rheumatic affections which have
heretofore been considered incurable.
The method consists in the local appli
cation of hot air to the parts attected. The
apparatus by which this is accomplished
consists of a copper cylinder, under which
several gas jets are kept burning. Into
this cylinder the limb is inserted and the
ends are closed. Stop-cocks are arranged
to let out moisture exuding from the skin,
and the temperature is raised 250 to 260
degrees. Precautions are taken to prevent
the limb from coming in contact with the
hot metal, and the application is con
tinued for fully lorty minutes.
Two patients were brought in for the ex
periment. One was a man who had been
under the care of a physician, who was
present, for several months, and had been
gradually growing worse. He was unable
10 move his toes or his ankle, and any
motion of the limb caused excruciating
pain. At the end of forty minutes, during
which time his temperature was raised
nearly 2 degrees, as shown by the mouth
thermometer, and his pulse increased
about fifteen beats per minute, the limb
was taken out of the cylinder; the patient
moved his toes as freely as does a child,
bent his ankle without difficulty and
walked with ease, feeling no pain. Other
rheumatic pains in other portions of the
bo â  y had also disappeared.
The second patient was a negro who
was suffering from a lone-continued lum
bago, and who uttered many groans as he
was being placed on an apparatus which
inclosed his back. He also was subjected
to the heat for forty minutes, and when
told to rise he sat up as readily as when in
perfect health. The temperature in the
first case was from 248 to 260 degrees Fah
renheit.
In the discussion which followed It was
stated by the exhibitor that these men
would probably ba better this morning
than they appeared to be when the ex
periment closed, and that in most cases
one application is sufficient. Where ex
tensive deposits had been made several
applications were necessary to remove
them.
The system has been in use in the prin
cipal hospitals of London, and accounts
of wonderful cures made in those hospitals
included cases of chronic rhematoid ar
thritis, old tuberculous knee-ioint,chronic
ulcer of leg. acute attack of gout following
sprain, sprain?, chronic rheumatism,
arthritis deformans, duration thirty
years; sub-acute articular raeumatism
anu many other cases of similar charac
ter. The results shown in the two cases
last eveninj* before the society were re
garded as very convincing as to the bene
fit of heat so applied.
The explanation given was that the in
creased temperature and more rapid circu
lation dissolved and carried off the depos
its upon bones and in the muscles, and
that this effect extended in a greater or
less degree to the whole body. The ap
paratus used is now for the first time
brought to the notice of the medical fra
ternity of this country. â Philadelphia

Queen Victoria, in her long life, has
traveled very little abroad. She has never
been in Russia, Denmark, Austria, Nor
way, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland nor
Greece. She has never yet set eyes on
any of her colonies, nor upon any part of
Asia, Africa or America.
The phenomena! Eichener Lake, in the

peculiarity of appearing and disappearing
at uncertain periods, has recently a?ain
made its appearance after a long lapse of
time.

There are more ways than one to skin a
cat, occe said an Irishman, and, applied
to the turf, this saying is literally true.
It certainly is a pretty good carve for the
owner of a 3 to 5 favorite in a race to be
interested in a book, back another horse,
which horse strangely enough happened
to win, and have his own finish a very in
different third. This little ditty might
possibly be applied to Key del Tierra,
which runs in the colors of the Cambridge
stable, and i* quite a prominent member
of that acrobatic, mystifying, soul-inspir
ing aggregation. His third to Sly and
Etta H in the second race at Oakland yes
terday should entitle him as well as
Jockey Coady to a well-earned rest.
If racing associations would appoint an
official wbose flutfes were to keep tab on
some few o* tte races that are run in the
betting ring and this official could be
kept pure, :ar away from the alluring
ticket-in-the-boot proposition, their
judges in the .nd would not age so fast
and there wou!d be fewer favorites beaten.
Bat then tbeir faith in ail maaiind might
be shaken, and devoid of uncertainties the
sport would be rained. !
Tie weather across the bay yesterday
was showery and the favorites experienced

The oiening chapter saw twelve horses,

a five- furlong scramble. To Mount Roy
was accorded tbe pleasure of ruling an
even-money choice. PF, an S to 1 shot,
ridden by Bob rsom. won easily from
America," witn the favorite third. Tne
latter horse, ridden by Johnny Weber,
was as coTd as 20 to 1 for the p. ace.
P.ey dei T erra was a 3to 5 favor I for

THIS GIRL TEACKED A BEAR.
Brought Him - Down. Too, "With Her *
Rifle, Coexisted.
Miss Anna Dickirson, IS years old, as i
pretty as blue eyes, rosy cheeks, fine form â 
and features can make her, killed a big '
bear at SeaDernr Settlement last Thursday
under unusual circumstances.
Anna came up on the stage on Tuesday
â  all wrapped up in cloaks and apparently j
] disgusted with the five inches of snow I
| that had fallen the night before. Her i
| luggage consisted of a big trunk, a sate el
; and a rifle. Everybody in town knew that
i the postmaster was to have a new boarder j
â a girl â but not one of them was aware of
the tact that the boarder could shoot with '
the best of them and win. They watcbed â 
the girl pick up the rifle and satchel and j
go into the house with open-mouthed in- ;
terest. That was about noon.
Two hours later Anna came out of the
I house looking entirely different. On her '
; hands were b.g mitten* On her head was
a knit cap that came down over her ears.
Her dress was of gray wool, the skirt com- ;
j me down below her knees to the tops of
I laced hunting boots. She had her rifle in j
: her hand. Tnree boars later she came '
; back with two big hares and three part
i ridges. Lsm Liwson expressed the cen
eral sentiment as sha passed the po.stoÂ£ce
toward the house when he said:
"By jimps, she ain't slow with that j
rifle." " . 1
Wednesday she killed some more pÂ«.rt- ]
ridges and rabbits, and on the following j
day went bnming atrain, heading on the \
trail toward the old Frazier clearing. She
I came back in aboct four hours. Instead â 
of going in'othe house, as usual, she went
: into the postoffiee. Every woodsman :
there made the most of the first gooa look
he had tod at iisr close by.
'"Got a horse and sled ?" she asked the â 
postmaster. -I want him if you have."
â er. 1 ' said the postmaster. "What
do â er want a horse and sled for?''
"Bear. Where can I get a horse, then?" â¢
Anna's n*xt question was.
"What!" said everybody, from the local ;
taxidermist to little lisle Frazier.
Then Anna said that she had shot a rear
op near the old Frazier clearing. Lem |
Lawson hitched up his horse, and the i
wood-men all went with Anna to see and
get the h*ar. Anna's rifle is a 35-55 re
peater. With it she had killed a deer at :
".borough. The rifle proved deadly : i
egain?t the bear while it was eating a bis
dead deer it bad found.
A : a\fcad followed the bear's track, as
she would have followed the track of a
rabbit, not ihin^ins That she would come i
\ up with a beast that walks as fast as bears j
do, but the bear had stopped, and, since \
: the girl was going qi:ie:iy. had not heard \
beÂ« until srse %ras aboni ten rod- from it. ;
TbÂ«n the beast had turned its bead and ;
looked over its shonljer at her. Anna
put a bullet into its bam. The missile ;
ranged forward and lodged in the neck, \
kiljing the bear before it could run ten ;
jnmps. Two other bullets missed while it \
was running.
This is the first bear, so far as is known, '
that a girl ,bÂ£s ever followed in its .racks. |
i after the manner of a s;:.. hunter, and i
succeeded isi killing. There are instances, !
however, where girls have shot treed j
Dears, or have come upon them nnex- ]
reetedJy while hunting other game.â 2Â»ew

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1596.
DOCKERY WINS ON
A TECHNICALITY
Judge EuDt Says the Milk
Inspector Is Not an
"Officer."
Cannot Be Removed From His
Place by Order of the
Superior Court.
If Guilty of Biackmailing He Shcn'.d
Bs Prosecu ei on a Criminal
Charge.
Milk Inspector James P. Dockery won a
| technical victory in Judge Hunt's court
: yesterday by the rendering of a decision
[ sustaining the demurrer filed in the case
! by his attorney.
The proceedings grew out of a charge by
! Ruhland <fc Zimmerman, milk dealers, who
| charged tnat Dockery attempted to black
i mail them out of $000 on the promise tnat
if they would pay that amount he would
i allow them to sell milk without having it
inspected according to law. .
When the case was called in Judge
Hunt's court Attorney Clunie, represent
ing Dockery, objected to the trial for the
reason that even if all the plaintiffs
alleged was true Dockery could not be
deprived of his position by such an action
as the one at bar and this position was
> held by the court to be in accordance with
law.
In sustaining the demurrer Judge Hunt
said tnat there was nothing in the Con
| solidation Act or in the Political Code
creating the office of Chief Milk and food
Inspector, but assuming that Doccery was
one of the six inspectors whose appoint- ,
\ ment was authorized by law, he was of I
i the opinion that such inspector is not an
"officer" within the meaning of the code, I
w.ich provides that tn accusation may be
! filed against any officer for collecunc \
illegal fees or far neglecting to perlorm j
his official duties. "At best." mid the
court, "the defendant is but an appointee
of the Board ol Health, performing the
dnties which the board exacts of nim and
subject to removal by the ni^mbrrs for
cause. He is as much an employe of the :
Board of Health as is a janitor o! the i
Board of Supervisors. The power of re- ;
moval of such employe is vested solely,
by 'he law, in the board employing him,
and a citizen aggrieved by his neglect or
refusal to perform his duty must seek re
lief at the hands of the board."
Judge Hunt added that if Dockery has
been guiity of the acts charged by Ruh- .
land & Zimmerman he is amenable to â 
the penal statutes Â»nd may be prosecuted
for felony. He held that the case was not
properly presented in the proceedings:
then under consideration and threw the i
entire case out of court.
Quite a number of milk-dealers are
earnest in their opposition to l>ockery, ;
and he is freely accused of unfair and ma
licious treatment of milkmen In his offi- i
c:al acts. The accusations embodied in
the complaint of Ruhland, .'<Â£, Zimmer
man were first presented to me Board of ;
Health, but the plaintiffs formed an opin
ion tbat they were not able to obtain an :
impartial hearing before that body and !
went duectly to the Superior Court. *
It was announced yesxerJay that the
effort to depose Dockeiy will be kept up i
wnh vigor. An action will be instituted
to compel the Board of Health to dismiss ;
Dockery on tite ground that he is corrupt
and unfit lor the place. The matter will \ â 
also iÂ»e taken before the Grana Jury and
an effort will be made to have him in
dicted.
After the decision of the case Dock err
filed a communication with the Board of
Health m which fat denounced as untrue
all the charges made acainst him, de
manding an investigation by the Board
of Health and reqnestinc that the matter
be referred i i the mronnni: Grand Jury.
MADE HIS OWN COFPIN.
An Old West Point Cadet Carrie* Out
a Queer Agreement.
On the bluff at Highland Park, overlook
ing the blue lake and shaded by creat
forest trees stands the residence of Colonel
I'armeuas Taylor Tnrnley. Nothing that
refined taste can suggest nor that money
can purchase is laccing to make it ihe
abode of luxurious comfort. In the loft
of the stable, which stands tack Jrcm the :
house, is a little room, into which the j
light painfully creeps through a perfect
barrier of branches without the window. '
In the gloom of the room stands a box,
says |tbe Chicago Chronicle. When the
eves become accustomed to the half light ;
one sees that the box is a coffin made ol
plain yine toards painted without the
color oi the leaves whicn the winds are
driftinc across . the lawn, and within a.
pure while.
There are no handles, and the cover, j
; which is to close over the occupant's :ac?,
lias leather j.inpes and rests upon the ;
; body of the casket..' The coffin is <he ;
' handiwort of Colonel Turnley, and for it
as a re?ting- place he will" chanre his.
â  jalatial residence Then the call comes.
The cost of the coffin was $4 43 and tue
colonel's labor. The last item cannot yet
be .Tat) .ted accurately, lor : the old
; soldier gives a new coat of paint to the '
! pine inside and out every few months and
I is bale en. ugh to live to repeat the opera- [
' tion many times.
| This is the fifth coffin which Colonel
i Turuley has built. Three of them have i
I been used 10 carry to the grave all that j
! was earihly of mree men who rose to the I
! rank of centra i, brigadier or major in the
armies of the United States. Trie four h ;
nÂ«.i not yet been used, but will be when
I iÂ»ps blows for one old warrior now on the i
i ret. red : list. The filth cofhn and the las: i
\ one made is the one in the lolt over the
maker's stable. - - ' _ ; .
Colonel Turnley graduated from West j
| Point in the cla s of IS4S, wnich turned j
out rather more than Its share of famous 'â 
men. â¢ J*efore receiving Ms appointment j
! to the military academy he had led a farm
jer boy' s life on the banks of ibe French I
i Broad; Rsvpt, in East Tennessee, and in I
addition to ; larm work ' had learned the I
trade of a carpenter.
Fifteen years ato he met four -class- I
mates at a dinner in Kew York. The five ?
> men who sat at that little table in a mod- 1
est restaurant were: all grizzled veterans. â¢
The conversation turned on lavish ds
play at Junerals,', and â â -. one comrade said :
; the custom was .: a bad one and that : ths
wido^r el many a man spent the sa vines ;
dM needed in order that there micLt be as j
: costly show at the . funeral' service. The 'â¢
I other lour soldiers agreed with the
speaker.:'
"A box, a prayer, the flag and a bunch !
of autumn leaves are enough lor me," said !
I one. " ' " '
"And for me,*' said the others, in
chorus. . .; , '
"I was a carpenter before I was a cadet,"
said Colonel Turnley, *"and I'il make \ ihÂ» \
; coffins, ;'.x>Â£int them | milk wh. c inside and i
; oak-leaves brown outside, and | ship ' them
; to you if you will each agree to be buried ;
iin ccc.":;';;,'"::";" ... : '.-."/' â ..;'-'â  '- "â â â '^ '"..'.. "-, 1 " i
The agreement was made and sealfid '
and the fire West Pointers s*rÂ«arated and
went *to * tneir hom?s- - C-olotiei - Turniey i
: transformed j bis ,; lofl ;at i Highlsnd Park !
j into Â» carpenter shop, turned the calendar j
btck SXyeitrs ana went to \roxk wito â  a â 
I saw, plane ana hammer. The coffins
i were turned out and shipped.
The mater has never told the names of
i those for whom he worked, thoucn it is
' fairiy weil known that the last coffin of
; his make to be t:=ed was the one in which
; Major-Genernl George ttoneman, the
\ famoa? cavalry leader, was carried to his
j grave.
The workshop where Colonel Turnkey's
j coffin rests i- forbidden ground. The ap
proach to it is through a trap door cut in
) t.':e tioor near the wall, and access is by
â¢ means of a vertical ladder. It is donflful
| if any one bat the colonel and the few
j friends whoi he has taken to see his mas
terpiece have ever crooked the threshold.
The fact mat the pises b isolated, a bit
gloomy and contains a c rSa has been sni
j ntient to k*ep pryen away.
BAREFOOT BABIES.
i A Physician's Interesting Experiment
With the Boy* anil tiirl*.
"I chanced to be present." remarked a
trained nurse to a group of professional
friends, according to tne Cleveland Leader,
â when a little eirl 3 years of ase. just re
turned from ihe West, was being put to
j bed. It was the last day of August and I
noted that she was suffocating in a heavy
high-necked, long-3leeved flannel shirt
and underdrawers, long, thick stockings
ana a flannel skirt, besides the full cotton
outfit; and this would, I know, be gener
j ally accepted as quite the proper and ra
i tional way to prepare a little child for
: long journey. To me it seemed little less
i than cruelty. .',
" "On ihe other hand, I am watching with
; great interest a little child 9 months old
j who has never had a shoe or a stocking on
| or bad its little feet covered* in any way
| during the day. Whenever *tfie weather is
! chilly the nurse c:ves them an occasional
i brisk rubbing, bet argues that since its
feet have never been covered ?hey are no i
i more sensitive than the hands, "and it is
! true that the little one has never had a
: cold. â¢ Daring the ho: weather, too, it was
; dressed in comparative comfort, which
translated, means as little clothing as :
possible. -
"One of the leading specialists in child j
: diseases in America, a most distinguished
; man, by the way, never allows his otoil- j
! dren to wear shoes and stockings except
when out of doors in midwinter until they
are sor 6 years old. All t-rougb the
spring and early summer they may, be
seen in park and public garden, walk
: ing about with their nurse, exquisitely !
' f rocked, but barefoot. Latt-r come the ;
long country rambles, and even in ]
the winter they never wear shoes in the
' home. The result of ibis experiment in bis
' own family has proved more than satis
factory to the famous physician and ihe
central ruaeedness and vi'cor of the chil- i
i dren is his most power. argument when
using the whole weight of his influence to ;
prevail upon other parents to go and do ;
likewise.
"It is to be hoped that saner notions in :
regard to dressing children in hot weather
may, in due time, percolate ail classes of
society, and that those who would hesi- â 
tate before the bareiob: idea may at least
go so far as to unburden their children of
that heavy weight of clotbing which is .
mora productive of coldÂ« and weakness
than all other causes combined." i
A DISSIPATED NOBLEMAN.
Reminiscence of the Career of the Earl 'â 
of AjHford in Texas.
"The finest specimen of a dissipated
nobleman I ever laid eyes on." taid J. M.
T raver of Â£aa Marcos, Tex., at the Metro
politan, "'was the late Earl of Ayis:ord,
wco honored the Lone Star State by bis
residence in its borders during the last
two or three years of bis picmres-qne
career. He was noted in almost every
capital of Europe for bis intemperate
habits and prodiral mode of life. He Â»**
only 57 years of age when death claimed
him, yet be looked lobe over 50, so rapidly
had he aged from excesses. In bis earlier*
days be bad been a boon cornjiauion of ibe
Prince of Waiei. and the pair bad been
liser homing in India, Aylsford paying
all expenses.
â '-.â "I don't suppose that Aylsford ever had
anydeSniie idea of turning over anew
leaf when be bought from the wreci of bis
once fine fortune a big cattle ranch in
Western Texas. He certainly made no
practical effort at reform, for one of hi*
first deeds was to fit out a first-class bar
room on his ranch and install a cowboy
as barkeeper. Nobody who wanted a
drink was refused one there, because it;
wasn't established for financial con*ii3era
lions. Drinks were practically free to
everybody, and the Earl was one of the :
best patrons of the place, HÂ« wasn't & j

PAUL JONES' SHIP.
The Bon Uomme Kichard Vat So Less
Unlucky Than the Texas.
There have been other unlucky ships '
before the Texas.
The Bon Homme Richard was one. ;
i Paul Jones himself, on takine command i
of her at I'Orient, France, wrote a most
; doleful letter about her to one of bib aris
, tocratic patronesses in Paris. She was "a
â  worn-out old lidiaman" 1 and "her fore- j
; castle was a BabeL" "Fourteen different ; i
languages are spoten in my forecastle," I
' said Jones, dismayed at the appearance of J
his motley crew. , Twodays out at tea the i
Bon H omme Kicbard was fouled by her
J consort, the Alliance* and had her;
jibborra and foretopmast carried away. i
Jones then put back to I'Omnt '.
'. to refit, perfectly convinced of the unlncki
: ness oi his *h;p. Bui tn.=t accident provea ; :
her salvation. â On his return Jones fonnd , ;
114 American sea en who had just been i
released rota E eiish prisons by ex
change. Among them was Richard Dale, â 
. whom Jones at once appointed hrst lieu- 1 !
tenant. These all voUnireered into the!
| Richard, Jones promp;ly { arcing â â  j
; enough of ais po ygiots to make way for ;
them. Prior Jo tnat he had only about :
forty American?. This addition made 154 â 
; fighting Yankee seamen, and they were !
the men who made the , Serapis sic% a few i :
â weeks later off the east coast of England. | i
Thus it happened that the crandest ex- j
| ploit in naval history was achieved by an : j
| unitickv ship, and she obtained the means \
' of achieving it through a distressing acci- 1
j dent.â Philadelphia Times.

REGULAR TRAINS
ON THE NEW ROAD
The Inauguration of the
Daily Passenger
Service.
VALLEY RAILWAY NOW
A COMPETITOR.
Its Half-Rate Passenger Fares
Surprise the San
Joaquin.
FIRST TRAIN LEAVES STOCKTON
UNHERALDED.
People of the Valley Lcok Forward
to a Fight Tbat Will Change
Old Conditions
The first regular passenger train of the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway went down the valley of the San
Joaquin yesterday.
lv departure from Stockton was not
attended by any demonstration; there
â were no crowds to bid the handsome train
bon voyage as the engine, screaming a
â¢warning to all, rushed from the channel
passenger depot on its southward flight to
the land of grapes and oranges. The en
gineer opened the throttle, the bell
clanged clear on the morning air, passen
gers waved adieus to their friends, and
that was all. The depot agent was at his
post with his assistants, everything ap
peared conventional, a plain business-like
affair, or would be so regarded in railway
circles, and nobody gave "Number 1" a
second thought. It was just a train leav
ing as other trains had done at the same
place.
But this incident is typical of the whole
management of the people's line, the
popular "Valley road," which has cut
passenger fares in half and reduced freight
rates in the great San Joaquin Valley 33
per centum. The men who in the face of
tremendous odds made the enterprise a
possibility and then a grand success cared
little for demonstrations about their work.
All they wanted was to succeed and ;o be
able to say to the people, "every promise
we have made has been lulfilled." In this
spirit the work was Degun and carried out,
and now when the first regular passenger
train goes into service the event so full of
meaning to California is allowed by the
Valley railway managers to pass with as
little ado as if it were the mere printing of
tickets.
So the pioneer of the regular passenger
service left Stockton and sped down the
valley. Only people who knew all about
it, who had watched every line published
in the newspapers about the progress of
the Valley railway in their eagerness to
learn what directly concerned their wel
fare, stopped and saluted the train.
in the field the farmer and his men for
got their task for a time as the streak of
smoke on the horizon told them of the
approaching train, and they watched the
speck crow, with a long cloud stretching
afar over plains of wheaten stubble
and meadow lands and orchards until, at
last, the first regular passenger train was
near. They cheered and waved their
hats as a welcome and a mark of good
wishes, and as the train passed away in
the dim horizon to the south they heaved
a sigh of relief; for this fleeing procession
brought hope and new courage. It opened
to them the outside world, which before
â was denied by high rates and fares that
were forbidding. But now there was an
assurance of a new order of things â a
daily train to carry people up and down
the great valley at exactly half the former
cost.
The train made good time to Fresno,
tlie temporary southern terminus of the
road, where it was met by a large number
of people. It was not so full of passen
gers, indeed, as the railway deserved; but
then, this was the first trip and the public
wa3 not aware of its presence.
Returning in the evening from Fresno
the train was "Number 2," the first regu
lar passenger train from the valley to
Stockton. It carried the last of the ex
cursionists who attended Fresno's citrus
fair, whose tickets expired yesterday.
The ride was all that could be desired, a
well-constructed, high-class roadbed unit
ing with an elegant and high-grade equip
ment to make it comfortable, and even an
inducement for passengers to travel over
the Valley road again.
The first regular passenger train to
make connection with the San Francisco
steamers at Stockton will be in service
to-day, and that is the opening of a daily
passenger service between this City and
Fresno at one-half the old rate. The pas
senger may leave San Francisco in the
evening, enjoy a bountiful yet dainty din
ner on the river steamer and a delightful
night sail. In the morning he can have
breakfast on the boat and immediately
afterward take the train at Stockton for
Fresno, where he will arrive at 1 p. m., in
good form for luncheon.

that the regular passenger service would
be inaugurated that day between. Kan
Francisco and Fresno, but, in reality,
the first regular passenger train, con
necting with the steamers of the Califor
nia Navigation and Improvement Com
pany leaves this city at the Weber-avenue
end at 7:20 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Since the opening of the citrus fair at
Fresno the Valley road has been running
regular trains. For the present the time
schedule on which the excursion trains
have been running will be in effect as
already published in The Call.
The cut in fare from the Southern Pa
cific rate of $5 90 to $3 75 is the occasion of
considerable comment, and passengers
from here down the valley are looking for
actual competition.
The freight business of the new road
has already assumed large proportions and
ill* bid for passenger patronage is signifi
cant of the fact that it is intended to cap
ture that. The coaches of the Valley line
are among the best in service, and no
pains will be spared for the comfort of
passengers. Last night's boat from San
Francisco will arrive early to-morrow
morning, and the start of the regular pas
senger train, which has been clamored for
here for some time, will be made for
Fresno at 7:20, arriving there at 11:50
o'clock. Returning it will leave Fresno
at 1:10 p. m. and reach Stockton at 5:40
o'clock.
The success of the excursions given
promises much for the popularity of the
new line, and the local office here sees a
busy passenger traffic ahead.
A TARIFF CONFERENCE.
All the Industrial Bodies of the State
to Meet and Discuss Legislative
Need*.
A tariff conference has been called by the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco to
meet at the hall of the chamber Thursday,
January 7, 1897. This is at the suggestion
of the California delegation in Congress to
consider the tariff required by the various
industries, manufactories and commercial
interests of the State.
Invitations have been extended to all
the county Boards of Supervisors and all
industrial bodies to send personal repre
sentatives or a formulated .-tatement of
what tariff is required to develop to a
greater extent the growing indnstiies of
California. This consensus of public
opinion will be the basis of action for the
delegation in Congress in framing the new
bill.
It is hoped there will be a generous re
sponse on the part of all commercial and
manufacturing bodies, and that there will
be an intelligent discussion of the matter.
CHRISTMAS DIVORCES.
Homes Made Happy by the Granting of
Legul Separations.
Christmas divorces are in order. Sev
eral were granted yesterday, and others
are expected to-day, while more are on the
calendars of the different departments of
the Superior Court, to be disposed of be
fore the close of the joyful holiday season.
Among the legal separations granted
yesterday were the following:
Stefano Carreale from Emilia Carreale,
desertion; Antoinette Bell from Henry
W. Bel), failure to provide; Mary Mitchell
from Samuel K. Mitchell, cruelty; Addie
Alexander from Bernard Alexander, neg
lect; Robina While from Charles I. White,
failure to provide.
In the case of Heinrichs against Hein
richs the husband is ordered to pay $40 a
month alimony pending the trial.
Divorce suits were riled yesterday as fol
lows: Emit Schlitt against Elizabeth
Sclilitt, Emma McMuJlen against W. H.
McMullen, Margaret Root against Henry
W. Root, Laura J. Sharp against William
J. Sharp.
A SMUGGLER CONVICTED.
Sam Brown Was Guilty, But P. Panta
ges Secured an Acquittal.
The case of Sam Brown and P. Panta
ges, charged with assisting in opium smug
gling, was concluded yesterday in the
United State* District Court. Brown was
convicted on one count and Fantages
was acquitted. Last month Customs Of
ficer Holmes arrested Brown on Twelfth
and Mission streets with 185 tins of opium
in two sacks and a basket. Brown's two
companions escaped. A few days later,
Pantages, the owner of a restaurant on
Fifth street, was aTestsd on suspicion of
being one of the escapes. It wa3 not
alone unon suspicion, for the informer,
George Peters, told the customs officers
that Pantages was one of the parties who
was to sell to him, Peters, the drug that
was siezed.
Brown's defense was that he had been
requested by two men to help carry two
packages, the contents of which he was in
ignorance. Pantages succeeded in prov
ing an alibi.
HIS HUMOR SAVED HIM.
A Charge of Petty Larceny Against
John Reid, Dismissed.
John Reid is something of a humorist,
and that fact led Judge Joachimsen yester
day to dismiss a charge of petty larceny
against him.
The complaining witness was Charles
Haape, 1070 Howard street, and he ac
cused Reid of stealing a pair of trowsers
from him.
Alter hearing the evidence the Judge
asked Reid if he had anything to say
wiiy sentence should not be pronounced
against him.
"If your Honor please," said Reid, "I
don't see how you can make this case
stick."
"Why?" asked the astonished Judge.
"You can't make a suit out of a pair of
trowsers," replied Rfid.
"The point is well taken," said the
Judee. "The case is dismissed, and you
can enjoy your Christmas at home."
BOCHE GETS $4000.
Substantial Damage* Awarded to a
Street Sweeper Who "Was Run Over.
In Judge Hunt's court yesterday a jury
gave a verdict in favor of Thomas Roche
for $4000 and against William A. Reding
ton it Co.
Mr, Roche was engaged in his occupa
tion as a street sweeper when he was run
over and severely hurt by a driver em
ployed by Rediogton <fc Co.
The injured man sued for $10,000 dam
ages on the ground that he was incapaci
tated ior manual labor of any kind. The
case was sharply contested by Attorney
Charles F. Hanlon for the plaintiff anil
Attorneys Van Ness and Thomas on be
half of the defendant.
Stay ot execution for thirty days was
granted and notice of appeal was given.

FOUR FALSE FIRE ALARMS.
A 31 an in Search vt Amnsement Risks

A witless practical joker turned in four
false alarms within an hour last evening.
The first box to call out the department
was 152, Brannan and Eighth streets, at
9:10 o'clock. Twenty minutes later box
182, Sixth and Townsend streets, was
sounded. Box 18(3, Fifth ami Bryant

BUTTE'S PLAYERS
ARE NOW IN TOWN
Montana Football Team
Ready for the Olympic
Match.
They Are Not Giants, but Have
a Fine Reccrd of Big
Victories.
O.ympic Has Borrow d From Other
Teams to Restrengthen H r

The Butte football team of Montana ar
rived in this City shortly after noon yos
terday on the belated Oregon express and
went at once to the Baldwin Hotel, where
the men will have rocms during their ten
days' visit in this City. A party of Olym
pic clubmen met them at the Sixteenth
street station in Oakland and escorted
them to this side of the bay. No ill feel-
Gene Sheehy, Olympic's Big
Guard*
ing whatever is entertained against the
Reliance Club, though Butte recrets it
could not once more try conclusions with
ti.e old rival.
The party consists of fifteen players,
one of whom, George McMillan, is man
ager, and a special newspaper correspond
ent, B. St. Charles, representing the Ana
conda Standard and the Butle Miner, two
morninc journals of Butte City.
The regular captain, big, red-haired Jim
Hooper, the old Michigan guard, could
not come with the team because of an at
tack of rheumatism. He delegated to
Percy Benson, the old California captain,
trie important duty of directing the team.
If, however, he recovers in time he will
be here to play in the Christmas game
with the Olympics or in the second game,
to be played on New Year's day.
De Gay Stivers, with all hip medals and
trophies and insignia and decorations
pinned upon his coat and vest, came this
year as one of the players. If anything
should happen to Percy Benson, De Gay
Stivers will lays aside his medals and go
into the game himself as quarter.
De Gay is the man who made a great
vow last year never to cut his long hair
until Butte should have defeated Reliance.
The maidens of Butte pleaded with De
Gay and his locks were sacrificed and his
vow was broken. '
Mrs. McMillan and Mrs. Gill is came to
this City in advance of their athletic hus
bands to see them play for Butte.
Yesterday afternoon the Butte men put
on their suits at the Olympic Club and
practiced signals and lively movements
ior a half bour on the Central Park
grounds, where they will face Olympic at
2 o'clock Christmas afternoon.
The Butte team is not a team of giÂ»nt3.
The men are lighter in weight than the
Olympics, but they have a good record. ,
Here is the record of ' Butte'a games this
season in the order in which they were
played, all being ; overwhelming vic

The stripped weights of the Olympic men

On this coast by reputation the Butte
team is an aggregation of star players, col
lected from all over the country, primar
ily to play football for the gratification of
a philanthropic enthusiast te-iding in
Butte. The Butte City Football Club is
an organization by itself. Its president,
C. W. Clark, is a wealthy capitalist and
mine-owner, and is the good angel of the
club. When the team went behind on
expenses last season because of long tours,
hecheerfully made good the deficit out of
his own pocket. He likes football. He
was the means of first establishing it in
Butte last season, and the whole mining I
town now centers its loyalty and athletic ;
enthusiasm in the Butte team. Every- !
bedy that can play tries to pet on the |
team. Naturally some football player--,
taking advantage of the courtesies and;
favors shown a gridiron hero, go to Butte
to engage in business, assured of a good
reception and of a more favorable open
ing than they might get elsewhere.
The three Pernam brothers are carpen
ters and have lived in Butte a year and a
half. Slater, formerly of the Union Iron
Works, has been a miner at Butte for
nearly five years. Prahm, the new center, I
is a miner and has lived at But:e for the
last four years. Hall, guard on the Prince
ton Varsity in '92 and '93, and sub
gua.d in '91, left Princeton without
graduating; later he did some football
coaching and in Chicago broke Hickock's
record by putting the sixteen-pound shot
44 feet %of an inch. He was graduated
from the law department of the University |
of Michigan last June and about three I
months ago established himself with a j
law firm in Butte. He is thÂ° giant of the 1
team. Jones played formerly at the Uni- j
ver.-ity of Nebraska, but has resided in j
Butte for a year, working in a smelter, j
McPheraon has been a Butte miner for the j
last five years. Benson was captain and
quarter of the University of California
learn last season. He has been employed
in a mining office at Butte for a year.
Dygert. formerly of the Michigan
Varsity, was undecided where io locate
after leaving collage, and was persuaued a |
3'ear ago by his old college matr, Jim !
Hooper, captain of the Butte team, to
hang out his lawyer's shingle in Buttt.
McMillan, formerly of the Stanford Var
sity and later captain of the Reliance,
went to Butte over a year ago to accept
the managership of the sporting uoods
deDartmentof a store there. Gtilis has I
been a mining engineer at Butte for the |
last three years. Lasweil is a bookkeeper |
and used 10 play on the Multnomah team
at Portland, but moved to Butte a year
and a half ago to accept a more lucrative
position.
Such is the Butte team. Its opponents I
this season have not questioned its ama- j
tenr standing.
Now for the Olympic team the way it j
appears to Butte:
McCormick of the Oregon was end at
the Annapolis Naval Academy last sea
son. Erskine is a recent arrival from I
England, where he played the Rugby \
game. Sheeny was on the Fania Clara i
College team last season. Ames of the I
army was West Point's center last season, j
Smith captained Olympic last season, was
tackle on the California Varsity in 1893,
and before that played at Cogswell Col
lege. Sexton clayed tackle for Reliance
ah this season ami tackle for Olympic last
season. Porter has played with Olympic
several seasons, was hailback on the Cali
fornia Varsity in 1891, and used to play
with Amherst College. Nolan of the
army was end for West Point last season.
Code was quarter for S'anford last season.
Morse has played with Olympic several
years. Searight is a Stanford Varsity
halfback of tins season, htickney is an |
old Harvard tackle and halfback, and
came here this season to coach Olympic, j
Felton Taylor is a member of the Reliance
team. The three other subs were devel
oped principally this season by Olympic. I
Such is the team that is representing the j
Olympic Club.
Last night the Butte team attended the
California Theater in a body. This fore
noon the visitors will talse a long drive
through the park and to the Cliff. This
afternoon they will engage in final prac
tice at Central Park and in the evening
will att< nd some theater.
After the New Year game, alÂ«o with !
the Olympics, Butte will ieare hero for
Portland, where the finai maich of the j
season will be played with the Portland j
Athletic Club. Immediately after that â¢
the players will return to Butte and dis- |
band.
Next year the Butte team has planned
to go East, and will meet the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, the Univesity of
Michigan, the Boston Athletic Club and j
the Chicago Athletic Club. A match had
been arranged with ihe University of
Pennsylvania for this Christmas. It, was I
to have been played at Butte, but had to be
cancelled on account of the cold weather.
When the Butte team left home four days
ago the thermometer registered 12 degrees
above zero, but three weeks before that it
was between 30 and 38 degrees below zero
for five consecutive days and the wind
made the weather particularly disagree
able for football on a frozen field.
Wants to Play Berkeley.
Manager McMillan of ihe Butte team
telegraphed last night to the University
of California Varsity team in Los Angeles
to see if arrangements could not be made
jor a Butte-Cahfornia game at Santa
Monica or Los Angeles some day between
Christmas and New Year's.
The Berkeley eleven are to play the Los
Angeles Athletic Club in Lo* Angeles on
Christmas day, and the Butte manager
hopes a second game may be arranged so
that the Montana players can go south be
fore the final game here with the Olym
pics.

MARRIED SIXTY
ONE YEARS AGO
The Gendars Celebrate
Their Wedding An
niversary.
They Are the Descendants of
Two Noted Revolutionary
Families.
A Hale and Hearty Old Couple Over
Whose Heads Time Has Passed
Lightly.
Not many people can celebrate sixty
one years of happy and almost unevent-
fnl married life as did Mr. and Mrs. Ed
ward Francis Gendar of 545 Stevenson
street last evening. The young couple â
young and handsome still, in spite of the
long duration of wedded bliss â called in a
few intimate friends and neighbors to
observe the auspicious and merry occa
sion and feast on the good things tnat the
bride of long ago had prepared.
Mr. and Mrs. Gendar were married in
New York City, he at the age of 21 and
she at 16, and now 84 and 77 mark the
years of their life. Mr. Gendar is a de
scendant of the French Huguenot*, his
grandfather fighting; in the American
army during the Revolutionary War, a
patriot true to the valor that sent so many
of his countrymen into freedom's fight,
and true 10 the glorious cause of the strug
gling colonists.
Mrs. Gendar's maiden name was Ann
Maria Post, and sne also springs from a
family that played a part "in that great
conflic:, her grandmother bein^r one of
the women who helped to raise the stars
and stripes over New York when the
British forces evacuated that city. She
can also claim kinship with the Living
ston family of colonial fame.
They came to this State in 1856, locating
in this City, where Mr. Gendar embarked
in the wholesale fruit business at 407
Front street. They, have lived in their
residence for over thirty years. Six
children were born to them, of whom
three sons, John W., William H. and Ed
ward M. are living. â¢
Mrs. Gendar, 77 years old, is a strikincly
handsome lady with cheeks as unwrinkled
as when she stood a bride of 16 at the
altar. With her beautiful gray hair drawn
back from her smooth brow Â«he is the
living picture of Martha Washington.
Time has indeed lightly touched this yet
fair daughter of the Revolution. During
the reception last evenine she sang to a
piano accompaniment "The Last Rose of
Bummer" in a pleasing manner.
The following friends were present at
the reception : Mr. and Mrs. P. J. Tormey,
Misses Clara, Isabelle, Edith and Julian
Tormey, Miss Clara Fitzpatrick, Mrs. J.
Moore, Mr. and Mrs. Beneue, Mrs. L.
Blake, Misses Irwin, Mrs. Kate Servant,
Mrs. Caldara, Mrs. Croikett and Samuel
Sonnenfeld.
PRINCIPLES OF SOCIALISM.
Rev. J. K. Scott Delivers an Interesting
lecture Before Liberty Branch.
Liberty Branch of the Socialist Labor
party was addressed by the Rev. J. E.
Scott in the TurE-street Temple last even
ing. Dr. Scott is the editor of the So
cialist.
The sta?e was tastefully decorated with
mottoes ana embloms of the Socialist
party. The American and the Socialist
ensigns were displayed on each side of the
platform. Ihe meeting opened with a
short introduction by Alfred Grimes, the
chairman, after which a solo by Professor
Cheapuy followed, at the close ot which a
reading was given from the Coming Na
tion by Secretary Theodore Lynch.
Dr. Scott reviewed the three basic prin
ciples of socialism, which he claimed
form a base for the great social move
ment and upon which rest largely what
ever there is of human interest and at
traction for the great majority of man
kind. Right economics, good order aris
ing from good organization and govern
ment and good morals or ethics are
essontially necessary to form a compact,
harmonious base or foundation for society
to rest upon and are aDsolutely indispen
sable to the welfare of the commonwealth
as they are characterized by the funda
mental principles of strength and excel
lence.
Continuing, the lecturer said: "Liberty
as related to economics needs a broader
definition than our statesmen are wont to
give it. Many men are inclined to regard
as heresy the doctrine of common owner
ship of land." He pointed out the natu
ral, humanitarian and altruistic features
of the socialist movement and added: "A.
divine law obliges man to love his neigh
bor as himself, and this law the socialists
are trying to obey."
