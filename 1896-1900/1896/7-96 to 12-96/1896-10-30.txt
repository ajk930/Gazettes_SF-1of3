Rousing Reception Given Speaker Reed
by the People of Santa Clara County^
GREAT ENTHUSIASM AT THE GARDEN CI^FY.
Thousands of Active Republicans Turn Out to Greet
the Maine Statesman and Hear His
Ringing Words.
â  From - the ! number of inquiries made by
telegraph *to '- the railroad .headquarters
during the past two days, passenger agents
of the Southern Pacitvc Company are con.
gjncedgvbat jiay raost extraerdinary and
wholly unprecedented 5 desire to come to
the City and take part in the â¢ demonstra
tion for McKinley and sound money has
sprang up throughout the interior. For
instance, Tulare, away, down in the San
Joaquin Valley, has chartered two sleepers.
Indications from other towns in the valley
i are that- each station will contribute at
least one lull car. A special train 5 will
leave Fresno and another will come from
Stockton in time to allow the .passengers
to reach the City shortly before the parade
starts. Tickets frpru tlm * San | Joaquin
Valley will be good for return until Mon

On the coast division there will be no
special trains. At every important sta
tion*, however, special cars will be set out
to be attached to the regular trains. At
least 1000 visitors are expected . from this
division alone south of San Jose, and as
many more are looked for on the trains of

way rate has been made, and a rate of one
and a third for shorter distances. Excur
sionists can come in on the Saturday
morning trains and go home Saturday
evening or Sunday. The railway passen
ger managers stated yesterday that they
expected to have use for all theequipment
on that division, and with that feeling
they have arranged to sidetrack dozens of
cars along the line where they will be
ready for use when the country folk crowd
in upon the regular trains Saturday. The
indications yesterday were that a large
cro^d will come from Sacramento, and
that the railway's accommodations will
bs taxed.
The Southern Pacific will have 1300 men
in the parade. These will include the
employes of the general ofiices and freight
sheds. Wells, Fargo & Co.'s men, 250

and wearisome coaches or, wagons, as did
the pioneers coming to California in early

caused railroads to be constructed.
"It would have been utterly impossible
in those days, when wealth was concen

way to have maintained itself for a single

be gauged by the money in the hands of a

of the wealth of this country that railways
are enabled to operate for the benefit and

said, were tried, the country would con

Speaker Reed spoke for three-quarters of
an hour and his address for effectiveness
was a masterpiece.
After the meeting at the Auditorium
Mr. Reed addressed another immense

Mr. Reed's reception here was as enthu

SPEAKER REED'S ARRIVAL.
Loses No Time In Inspecting San
Jose's Improvements.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 29.â Speaker
Thomas B. Reed and hie party consisting
of Congressman Frank Aldrich of Chi
cago, Charles M. Shortridge and Miss
Kittie Reed, the daughter of the distin
guished statesman, arrived in this city
from Stockton on a special train shortly
after 1J o'clock this morning. A special
committee from the Santa Clara County
Central Committee consisting of Colonel
Hersey, D. H. C. Brown, J. P. Fay and E.
A. Hayes met the party at Niles and ac
companied them to this city, where they
were met at the broad-gauge depot by a
large delegation of the County Committee
and escorted to the Hotel Vendome.
Miss Kitti.e Reed was the recipient of
special attention from the committee of
young ladies, consisting of Misses Emily
and May Doyle, Misses Mabel and Grac*
Adel â  and Misses Florence and Hazel
Park. Miss Reed was taken to the Ven
dome in a handsome four-in-hand turn-
out, where she was entertained at lunch
eon. In the afternoon the daughter of the
distinguished statesman was accompanied
by the young ladies' committee on a drive
through the suburbs of San Jose.- She ex
pressed her delight at the beauties of this
county and the hospitality shown her by
.the committee.
After luncheon at the hotel Speaker
Reed and Congressman Loud went for a
stroll about the city. Mr. Reed lived here
in 1863 and studied law and was admitted
to practice -here. Bpeaker Reed expressed
his desire to the committee to be allowed
a part of the afternoon to himself, In order
that he might go about the city. Of courso
this request was complied with.
When the committee recited the ar
rangements which had been made for tne
evening, Speaker Reed was hearty in his
expression of thanks for the consideration
shown him, and stated that he did not
think a better arrangement 'could have
been made for the comfort of the people
who should desire to hearhim. Mr. Reed's
voice was still suffering irom the strain to
which it nad been subjected dnring his
tour ihrougn the country, and he was
very much afraid the committee would
make him speak in some vast hall whose
acconstic powers were bad and where he
could be heaid by only a few and his voice
greatly taxed in an effort to speak very
loud. He stated that by the arrangements
adopted he would be heard by many more
people and his voice left in some condition
for his San Francisco address.
Accompanied by Congressman Eugene
F. Loud, whom he spoke of as his "per
sonal friend," Mr. Reed walked through
the business part of town and out Santa
Clara street as far as Coyle Creek. Speaker
Reed expressed his delight but not sur
prise at what he saw. Upon bis return to
the hotel he said:
"San Jose has "but fulfilled my expecta
tions of what it would be. When I lived
here in 1863 it was a very small but even
then a very pretty place. I knew it would
grow and become a fine city, for I saw
what A fertile valley there was about it.
The nature of the improvements struck
me very forcibly, and they are a credit to
the people and to the city government.
The streets are about as pretty as yon will
find anywhere, and the portions of the
city I have seen have a clean and prosper
ous appearance. I k:.ew the valley was
very rich, bujt I must say its fertility has
surprised inc. It is a delightful place to
live, and I shall always remember my
residence here as well as my occasional
visits with great pleasure, and the people
of the county can always count upon me
to assist them in any way in which my
official position may enable me."
' This afternoon Mr. Reed was called
upon by a large delegation of natives of
Maine residing in this county, who
through their spokesman, S. A. Barker,
expressed their desire to shake hands with
their honored countryman.
Mr. .Reed receive J ; the delegation in an
affable manner and after shaking hands
.all round expressed his del ght at seeing
representatives from his State. C. P.
Berry, who was among the delegation,
was at once recognized as an old friend of
the Speaker.
Colonel John S. Mosby, known inter
nationally as the "guerrilla 1 ' of the Con
federate army, who was for seven years
United States Minister to China, came
down from San Francisco this morning to
pay his respects to Mr. Reed and the
meeting of tde old soldier and the states
man was very cordial. Colonel J. P.
Jackson, the San Francisco orator, arriveu
this afternoon, and was the recipient of
much attention at the hands of the Re
publican committee and the prominent
men of this city who congregated in the
lobby of the Vendome to entertain the
visitors.

business along the line of march and a
general air of expectancy pervades the
town. Santa Rosa people are loyal to all
that appertains to Santa Rosa and her
welfare and the distinguished visitor will
be claimed as the city's guest. Few inte
rior towns in this State can equal Santa
Rosa in the matter of accommodations
and there will be no difficulty experienced
in handling the immense crowd.
The pavilion where the speaking will
take place is beautifully situated in the
midst of a veritable flower garden in the
city park. Here 5000 people can be seated
and half as many more can 596 and hear.
The acoustic properties of the pavilion
are unexcelled and it is confidently as
serted that 10,000 people will hear Mr.
Reed's discourse to-morrow afternoon.
The McKinley clubs from Ukiab. Clover
dale, Healdsburg, Petaluma and the small
intermediate towns will march in the Dig
parade headed by the local bands.
Excursions from all points on the Dona
hue and the Carquinez railways have been
planned at low rates, and 20,000 people is
a low estimate of the crowd that will be
here. The committee of arrangements
consists of Colonel H. W. Byington, Allen
B. Lemmon, Captain J. H. Brush, Sena
tor J. W. Ragsdale, Major O. Fountain, M.
V. Vanderhoof. Frank Muther ana O. O.
Webber. These gentlemen will also form

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 21.â T0 close
the speaking campaign in this city, the,,
McKinley League of New York held a
rousing rally in Carnegie Hall to-night,
and the fact that Colonel Robert G. Inger
soil was to be the chief speaker attracted
an audience that filled the hall long before
the meeting was called to order. ' '
Among prominent people in the boxes

â  John E. Milholland of the league pre
sided and after the preliminary addresses
introduced Colonel Ingersoll, who . began
his speech in a vigorous \ manner as soon
the applause which greeted him and which
lasted several minutes, bad subsided. He
said in part: , . â -. ; . ;
This Is our country. i The legally expressed
will of the majority is the supreme law of the
land. We are responsible for our Government
We cannot excuse ourselves for the acts of the
nobles. : We are the kings; wo are the nobles;
we are the aristocracy of America.' .When the
Government goes wrong the blame is on our
brow. We should all vote as we like.
I love this country because the people are
free, and if they were not it would be their
own fault. lam not going to appeal to your
prejudices, even if you had any. IÂ«m going
to appeal to your brains and heart, and ask
you to maintain the honor of your country.
Three great questions are presented: First,
as to money; second, tariff; and third, right of
self-defen6e. Wh.at is monoy? Money is a
product of nature, something that man cannot
create. It is not made. It has to be found.
And yet we have a man running for the Presi
dency on three platforms with two Vice-
Presidents who says that money is the crea
tion of law.
Mr. Bryan wants money so poor that the
poor cannot spare It; so poor that the rich
won't have it. The farmers of Maine and Ver
mont have answered him. I have confidence
in the farmers who, when the sun shines and
the crops flourish, pay their debts. Bryan
says "Vote for cheap money and pay your
debts." Creditors say "What is going to be
come of me?" The question is, Can Congress
make 50 cents worth a dollar? If they Can, let
us save the sliver and use it for something
â¢else.
Bryan says that gold has been cornered and
that millions of people believe It. It is strange
how credulous some people are. They say gold
has been cornered, and yet for several years
the rate of interest has gone down. If gold
had been cornered silver would have ad
vanced. Why not corner silver? Perhaps it
is too poor to corner.
Mr. Bryan says that free silver will make
silver IU to 1. Why stop there? Why not
make ill to 1? Mr. Bryan hates the bond
holders of the railroads. What did those
wretches do? I don't know. They helped to
build the 180,000 miles of our railroads, build
cars, equip roads and maintain them. Mr.
Bryan hates the rich. Would he like to be
rich? He hates the successful man. Does he
want to be a failure? If he does tell him to
wait until the 3d of November.
There is the question of tariff. I want the
American people, as far as possible, to manu
facture everything that they use. I want to
Keep this country to ourselves. In order that
we should prosuer, musclo must be in partner
ship with brain.
I woula rather have one good county in New
York than the whole of Mexico. I am no
prophet, nor the sop of a prophet, nor a very
profitable son.
In 1892 I said If Cleveland was elected he
would cost the country $5,000,000,000. He
has cost it more. We took the wrong man on
the train at Buffalo, and we put the wrong
man off. We want to produce great men and
women hero in our country. We want busi
ness. We don't want any populistlc philan
throphy. It forms a golden bow on which a
line has been seen the glittering bow and
dawn of promise. Let us have protection.
How much? So much that our income will
be equal to our output. I don't like to see a
mun pawning his bonds to pay his own salary
with.
We have no classes In the United States. A
millionaire may be a milkman; a milkman
may be a millionaire. Mere we have the free
open field of competition. After all lew
rich men own their property. Their property
owns them. Sometimes they think their chil
dren would like to see a first-class funeral.
Why should we envy the rich? They never
drank any colder water than I dia. They
never saw brighter sunsets. They never heard
sweeter music. They never read better poetr
than ne do.
I have nothing against the men that get rich
in the free aiid Â©pen field of competition. We
should help the poor, succor the sick and raise
the falien. Let us have protection. Let us
prosper. McKinley is a man who loves his
country. He knows what money is and would
never think of putting a Innd claim on a
cloud- Vote for the party of Grant, the great
est soldier the world has ever seen. Vote lor
the party of Sheridan and Sherman.
STEENGTH OF REPUBLICANISM.

for Mr HI 11 ley.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 29.-Final reports
by letter from the leading men of Repub-.
lican States have been coming to head
quarters here for the last week. To-night,
after a council of the National Committee,
it was decided to give to the press these
reports as fast as they were received, fol
lowing the action of the campaign chair
man of the Democratic National Commit
tee. Only parts of the reports from each
State chairman were run out. The ex
tracts, in substance, from the reports re
ceived up to to-night are as follows:
Indiana â I feel confident McKinley will
not get less than 25,000 majority, and it
may be 00,000. I base these estimates on
the recent thirty-duy poll, which was as
favorable as the sixty-day poll of the
State.
lowaâ Sure to carry the State by not
less than 40,000. Hard tights in the Sec
ond, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth and Eleventh
Congressional districts.
Kansas â Will give McKinley not less
than 8000 majority, based on reliable in
formation received from every precinct. I
believe the entire eight Congressmen will
be elected. One hundred speeches a day
are being made under direction of com
mittee.
Nebraskaâ Claims the State by 18,000
majority.
Michigan â Absolutely sure of not less
than 20,000 majority for McKinley, and
believe it will exceed that. Predict full
Congressional delegation from the State.
I have not predicted success publicly, but
our reports are overwhelmingly favorable.
Minnesota â Our last poll shows McKin
ley 's majority to be 15,000. We have strong
hopes of more. Minneapolis 13 uncertain.
May gives 5000 either way. St. Paul is
safe. Congressional districts 1, 2, 4 and 5
are sure, and our chances good lor carry
ing the Third, Sixth and Seventh.
New Yorkâ The New York State major
ity for McKinley will exceed 300,000. New
York City will give McKinley 60,000 ma
jority. The Congressional majorities will
run from 1500 to 14,000 or 16,000 in the
Twenty-secona and Thirty-fourth dis
tricts. We will elect 120 of the 150 mem
bers of the General Assembly, and as we
have a majority of 20 in the Senate, we
will elect a Republican to succeed Hill.
Ohioâ We claim the State by 100,000
majority.
South Dakotaâ Third poll of State gives
McKinley 8000 majority. In this estimate
we are counting out as against every
doubtful vote. We have insisted on being
conservative. Democrats seem to have
given up the contest on the Presidential
electoral ticket and are concentrating all
efforts on the Legislature. Pettfgrew has
funds and is leaving money in every
county. National Cominitteeman Kit
tredj;e puts our majority in the Legisla
ture at 90 out of 136. Chairman Munn of
the Black Hills region gives the State to
McKinley by 4000 on a most conservative
estimate.
Texasâ Reports justify the belief that
McKinley will carry Texas.
West Virginia â McKinley's plurality
will not be less than 11,000. All four Con
gressional districts are safe.

NEWARK, N. J., Oct. 29 âGarret A.
Hobart's visit to this city to-night was

dustrial demonstration unparalleled in
the city's history. .He made a very brief
speech at Caledonian Park Hall, where
there was an enthusiastic audience of
4000. For New Jersey he bespoke such a
crushing majority against the Democratic
leaders and their platform a3 to forever
set at rest the scheme for enriching specu

Cent Collars.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 29.â A campaign
sprint to a number ot towns in Northern
Illinois acd back again to Chicago was not
the best preparation for the hard work
that lay before William J. Bryan to-night
in his rounding up in this city. A dozen
speeches in the outlying districts and nine
more here was the Democratic candidate's
portion of the day and evenine. When he
had said good-by to his last Chicago audi
ence he hurried to the Northwestern sta
tion and was off again on anotner flying
trip, this time through Wisconsin.
The clouds hung over Chicago this
morning when Mr. Bryan, accompanied
by Mrs. Bryan and a numbsr of local sup
porters, started out on his visit to neigh
boring communities. He ran into a rain
storm before he had gone very far, but the
downpour ceased during the afternoon.
Great masses of threatening clouds hung
over the country through which he passed
for the rest of the journey. They did not
break, however, and altogether the cannon
ball campaign he made was not seriously"
interfered with by the weather.
Elgin heard the candidate first and then
Mainturn, Belvidere, Rockford, Freeport,
forestall. Polo, Dixon, Ebchelle, De Kalb,
Geneva, Wheaton and Mainwood. The
rain did not keep the crowds away. The
people swarmed around the train where
ever it halted, and a sea of expectant
faces looked up at the candidate at each
place scheduled for a speech, while the
crowds cheered him, some with wild
heartiness, and the enthusiasm of a few
audiences was teniDered by shouts for the
Republican standard-bearer and display
of yeilow ribbons bearing Major McKinâ
ley's name. Nearly ail the stops were
brief, and a speech was made at each,
with the exception of Freeport, where two
addresses were crowd; d into a half honr.
It was raining hard when ne arrived
there and the meeting was held indoors.
Both halls were crowded, and despite tiie
downpour large numbers of people were
at the station when the candidate and his
wife returned, and a very pretty incident
happened. A gray-haired, sweet-voiced
old lady on whom the burden ot years
had fallen, managed to reach the car plat
form, and looking Mrs. Bryan in the eyes
said in trembling tones: "Madame, I bave
ridden twenty-three mil?s to see you."
Then she put her arms around the can
didate's wile and kissed her.
A brief stop was made at Foreston to
enable Mr. Bryan to address about 500
people. Ten minutes was the time al
iowed him at Polo, which was reached at
3 o'clock. He talked to 1000 or 1500 from
the rear of "The Idler," and from there
went to Dixon, where elaborate prepara
tions had been made for his reception. An
artillery company in uniform fired off a
loud-soundingcannon close to the train as
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan alighted to take a car
riage for the speaking place, the portico ot
a hotel, and more than 10,000, liberally es
timated at 15,000, were there to near
him. Some of them wore the orange, but
they did not attempt any counter demon
stration.
Running down to Rochelle, the next
stop, the train slowed down in passing the
station at Ashton to enable a crowd to see
and cneer Mr. Bryan and his wife. Mr.
Bryan was rushed through the back door
of a store at Rocbelle to a platform facing
the open Btreet. To the 3000 people tnere
he said : â¢
They tell you that silver agitation has scared
gold out. Gold is a mighty cowardly thing ii
it is scared by a craze that is as nearly dead as
the Republicans say ours is. [Cheers.] Is it
sufficient to build up a financial system upon
gold as a base when you can't find gold when
you want it ? D.O you build a house on nn
invisible foundation ? [A voice, l% Yeri."]
Well, a Republican would if he acted in boast
building like his party does in finance.
[Cheers.] Why is it that when a man begin* to
advocate the gold standard he has to forget
all that he ever learned iÂ»i ordinary business
transactions? , Wuy is it that he remses to ap
ply to the money question the things that
govern him In his every-day life? How can a'
man chloroform himself when he has to dis
cuss the money question so that he can be
lieve in gold anyhow? [Cheers.] Ask your
selves these questions belore election day, my
friends.
The sun had gone down and twilight
was merging into darkness as Mr. Bryan
stepped from his carat De Kalb.where 2500
people were gathered about a stand erected
on a corner. The nominee was cheered as
he faced his audience. With his hat'
jammed down on his head and his over
coat collar buttoned close to the throat, he
talked about the arguments advanced by
his opponents. He said:
They tell us we must so shape our policy as
to be able to get money from abroad for in-;
vestment. I say that as long as foreigners run
our financial policy we will always be bor
rowers and never bts dble to pay our debts and
become money-lenders ourselves. [Cheers.]
Flickering oil lamps cast sallow glooms
on the candidate's face as he stood in a
.stand erected near the station at Geneva,
and talked to a couple of thousand of men
and women. Wheaton came next and a
crowd, as large if not larger than that .at
Geneva, was present.
MainwooJ was the last stop. Cheers
for McKinley followed the shouts of the
Bryan men among the assemblage of 3000
wno heard Mr. Bryan speak from the bal
cony of a hot 1 within sight of his train.
Notwithstanding the opposition senti
ment the audienco showed considerable
enthusiasm. The rain had begun again
when the special drew into the North
western station at Chicasro. About 100
people gathered about "The Idler" and
cheered the candidate as he alighted. Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan entered a carriage and
were taken to the Auditorium annex.
The distance covered in the flying trip
was 285 miles. Mr. Bryan bad scarcely
time to eat a hasty dinner ar the Audi
torium annex before be wns in his car
riage, being whirled away to the North
Side. The first of his speeches was de
livered at Stanisiaus Hall, corner of Brad
ley and Noble streets. Notwithstanding
he was over an hour late in arriving he
found the hali packed with people. The
disagreeable weather did not deter thou
sands from turning: out to welcome the
candidate, Rnd it was with difficulty that
a passage was made through the crowd
Irani the hall to the carriage.
Social Turner Hall, on Belmont avenue
heard the candidate for a few minutes at
9a. m. Lincoln Turner Hall was reached
a half hour later and fl ages Hall, at CJy
bovtrn and Southport avenues, at 10
o'clocK. Mr. Bryan was cheered by a
tremendous crowd in and around Garfield
Turner Hall, at Garflel.l avenue and La'r
rabee street. He addressed them briefly
and after another talk of about ihe same
length at Meelers Hall, 364 North avenue,
in which the Bismarck letter was given
prominence, the candidate was given a
o-ood rest while he was driven tothe JNorth
Side Turner Hall, on Clark street, near
Chicago avenue. About 4000 people were
crowded into this favorite Worth biae re
sort and the candidate awarded them a
apeech of consideraDle length. One more
talk-that at Brands Hall, threÂ« blocks
away-finished the hard-day's and night s
work, and at 11:30 Mr. Bryan, left on hs

"BATTLE AGAINST PL UTOCRACE."
Democrats Go Haft Over the Mad Scram
ble for Votes.
â WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 29.â The
following call was issued to-nieht from
Democratic headquarters:
October 29, 1896..
To the Voters of the United Slates: In the pre
liminary battle of the people against thepu
tocracv "the people have already won. In Â»pite
of an expenditure ot money so larÂ«e that th,e
world stands appalled at its
a large majority of the people of the L rated
State? arfin open revolt against the merciless
gold standard and the domination of the
fSiiitrJ by the syndicated wealth of Europe
and America interested in securing or prevent
ing legislation and in controlling the exercise
of the laws in their interest. ani .. ni .
All that is necessary to secure the register
ing of the people's .will is -to see that every
â voter comes to the polls and casts an dnpur
chased ballot. Many of the millions con-,
tributed by the syndicates-have been reserved
for election day. Beaten at every popt, the
last resort of money is to buy the ballot of the
voter by purchasing his absence from the polls
or to coerce his vote by intimidation. To pre*
vent this is possible if every patriot w;ll do his
duty. .Every member of a club must go to the
polls early in the moruing on eieetion day,
cast his bailot and remainuutil the polls close
and the result is announced. Take cure that
every voter gets to the polls and
casts his vote. Note down â  the names
of every absent voter. Let it be known that
the citizen who fails to vote, unless prevented
by extreme illness, has either been purchased
by the money"of the corruptionlsts or is other
wise unworthy to be called, a citizen. All
signs indicate the overwhelming triumph of
the peoDle, and to no organizations is more
credit due for this than to the'clubs, the peo
pie's organizations, createa for unselfish pur
poses, battling for ihe liberties of the people
as iv days of their founder, the illustrious au
thor of the Declaration ot Independence.

SOTERIGN'S INELIGIRILITY.
Failure of the Elector to Pay Poll Tax
Causes a Sensation.
LITTLE ROCK, .Ark., Oct. 29.â Tfee
news of J. R. Sovereign's ineligibHity to
serve as an elector, as he had failed to pay
his poll tax, caused a great sensation
throughout the State, although it- has
been known by Governor Clarke, Secretary
of State Armistead and Attorney-General
Dinsworthy for ten days. Each of these
officials frankly admit its correctness-to
day. Three days after the Democratic and
and Populist State Central Committee had
agreed upon a fusion upon electors a re
port reached 'Governor Clark that J. R.
Sovereign, one ot the Populist electors
selected by the Populist committee, was
disqualified as be had failed to pay his
poll tax, which is the essential require
ment of citizenship in Arkansas. An in
vestigation was immediately started and
the report was found to be true. It was
too. late,' however, to substitute another
name, as the time for filing certificates of
nominations . had expired : the day after
fusion had been agreed upon. The matter
will probably go to .the courts for settle
ment*

THE PHILIPPINE REVOLT.
Important News Braughf by the Steamer
Victoria of the War on the
Islands.
TACOMA. Wash,, Oct. 29.â The steamer
Victoria, which arrived late this afternoon
from Yokohama, brings latest tidings
concerning the Philippine war. The
Hongkong Press of September 30 says
that the town of Manila, on the Philip
pine Islands, is surrounded by a strong'
guard of sentinels, and the residents sleep
with revolvers under their pillows.
Pedro Roxas, "Captain Lewis," is still
in jail. The Press continues: "There is
no doubt that there is a good deal of
truth in the rumor that the Philippines
endeavored to get assistance from the Jap
anese, as one of the active participators in
the attempt, a well-known doctor, has
been arrested and thro-wn into p jisor. . .
There is also a tinn belief that certain
people in Hongkong have teen assisting
in organizing the rebellion, ana it 13, Â»â 
well-known fact that about a month ago
one of the leading and xichesl, pi the in
surgents came here from Manila to confer
witn friends in the colony about details oi
the plot."
Manila papers to haad continue tore
cord numerous ar.rests and dismissals,
from office of convicted or suspected indi
viduals. The names of thirty-ei-rht school
masters of various parishes in the prov
ince of Incaviter afe given, whose where
abouts are unknown, and who, beins; sus
pected of having joined the rehels, are
suspended from office.
In Cavite the position appears to rem&in
as Jast reported, the rebels being in pos
session of the province with the exception
of the town and arsenal.
More awful stories are circulated of
shocking atrocities- cominUtd on botn
sides. A woman who confessed the "plot
to a Driest is now under the protection of
the Government, while the priest who di
vulged the secret was among those caught
in the convent at Imus, ana he was flayed
to death and then roasted.
Arrests of rich natives continue to be
made, and 110 one knows what their fate
will be.
From the province of Batansas it was
reported that late in Septembsr there had
been a seditious rising In the parish of
Tuy, in which it was estimated that 1000
persons took part.
Seventy men of the Government forces
stationed there defended themselves he
roically and in tnte evening were re
enforced by 200 soldiers an,, next day
further large re-enforcements arrived
bringing the number up to 1200, when the
rebels were dispersed with great loss.
It, was stated that. the force in the pro
vincial capital was Sufficient for all con
tingencies. The convent was fortified
ana twenty-three priests from the sur
rounding parishes had taken refuee there
A volunteer force had been formed

JEWETT IS UNDER ARREST
An Assistant Postmaster With
a History Embezzles Fed

As Chairman of the Louisiana Re
â '. fuming Board H> Caused the
"â¢â¢â  ;. â¢* â¢ Defeat of Tilden.
â  DENVER, -Colo., Oct. 29.-A few days
ago Fos-othce Inspector Mechen received
a teiegrtftn. trbm Albuquerque, sent by In
spector Fredericks, who staled that he had
arrested D. j/ M.. j eW ett, assistant post
master at Fort Stanton, N. M., for embez
zling, funds of the money order depart
ment to the- amount of'sisi 26, and that
he.would be arraigned at Socorro at the
December te-rm -.of .the United States
court. This morning' a letter was received
from Inspector. Fredericks "stating who
Jewett isi He" is ; tue same man who, as
chairman of the . Louisiana retflrning
bbard' in 1876, defeated Samuel J. Tilden
for the Pre,sid-ency and elected Rutherford
B. HayeS: It will be remembered that
tneje was 'a bitter contest for the Presi
dency at that time, and that a hot contest
waged in tne Eie6toral College. Louisiana
was claimed by ttre Democrats, who af
firmed that the Republican nominee for
Congress had been elected, but that he
had run over^OOO votes ajifead of His ticket,
and that the Democratic electors had been
chosen. ,
The returning board, beaded by Jewett,
after.a long and bitter struggle, finally re
turned the Republican elactrora. This
made the vote in the electoral college 185
for Hayes and 184 for Tilden. TJie eight
electoral votes of Louisiana were thrown
for Hayes. The Democrats protested this,
and tne returns from this State, as well as
from Florida, Oregon and South Carolina,
were referred by Congress to an electoral
commission composed of eight Republi
cans and seven Democrats. This commis
sion, By a strict t>arty vote, sustained the
Republican returns in every instsnee and
overthrew the Democratic returns on ac
count of alleged frauds, giving the Tote
185 to 184, as stated above.
The Democrats have always considered
the Louisiana returning board, and par
ticularly its chairman, Jewett, as being re
sponsible for the defeat of Tilden and his
ultimate death. Jewett was ostracized
upon every possible occasion, and finally,
in sheer desperation, sought an appoint
ment of Assistant Postmaster at the little
town of Fort Stanton, nearly 180 miles
from the r.ailroart.
FIERCE FIGHT AT SANDSBURG.
One Man Killed and Two Seriously Wounded
in a Barroom Quarrel Over a
Poker Came.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct. 29.â News
reached here to-day from Randsburg, the
new mining camp on the desert over a
hundred miles from here in this county,
that a desperate shooting affray toot place
there last night in which one man was in
stantly killed and two others were fatally
wounded.
There being no telegraphic communica
tion nearer than 'fifty miles no, details
were obtainable to-day. It is # reported
that one man named Ault, another named
Richards and another named Kaniey were
killed. The Sheriff, Coroner ami District
Attorney were telegraphed for, and, with
The Call correspondent, left at 7 o'clock
this evening for the scene. ,It is suiaiised,
from the paucity of the information re
ceived, that a sensational tragedy has
occurred. - : . .-â ',*
Later news- is to the effect that the af
frayoccurred in a saloon kept by one
Thompson at Fiddler? Gulch, near Rands
burg. ' A quarrel . arose between two gam
blers, named Woofer and Brewster, over
a poker game, and they began shooting at
each other. â¢ Ault, the man killed, was a
spectator and had no part in the affray.
After he was killed the shooting became
general, and some fifty shots were fired.
Finally both of the men who started the
fight were, rendered helpless from their
wounds and the shooting stopped. Both
gamblers were - seriously wounded, but
were put under arrest," and are now en
route to Bakefsfield, in charge of the offi
cers. It is not expected that they will
live: . * * â

ALL SIGHS POINT TO PICTURE.
Even JUiisouri J'romiaet to Give a Ma
jority for McKinley.
. CHICAGO, liX., Oct. 29.â Missouri con
tinues to be the State most talked about
qnd reported at the Republican head
quarters. The campaign manageis, from
Chairman Han-na down, are now settled
in their convictions that there is an even
Chance in that State-.for the Republican
Presidential ticket. They were cheered
.by the report from" New York that even
money was now being, wagered on Mis
souri going for' McKinley. Charles H.
Smith of St. Louis, who is.National Com
mitteeman Kerens'" confidential secretary,
arrived at headquarters to-day. He places
the- gold Democratic strength in Missouri
at 50,000, 80 per cent of which he says will
go to McKinley, according to the open ex
pressions of those Democrats. Twenty
five thousand of their .votes, in the opinion
of Mr. Smith, will be sufficient to give the
State to the Republicans.
The bulk of the credit for this reported
change in political sentiment is given to
the Business Men's Sound-money League
of St. Louis, under whose auspices a big
demonstration is being organized for Sat
urday," Fifty thousand men are expected
to be in the parade and the large business
houses hayÂ« agreed to make the day a
holiday. The Populists of the State are
said to be helping the Republicans by a
row on account of the withdrawal of
Jones, their candidate for Governor.
Frank E. Richey, the Populist candidate
for Attorney-General, has denounced the
withdrawal, saying:
"Had the withdrawal been ; made earlier
in the campaign it could not have been
justly criticized. Had it been handed in
on the day it was written, October 1, the
members Of the committee could have
tised their judgment in filling the vacancy
and no frightful injustice would have
been done, but to deliberately withhold
the resignation until the committee and
â¢ party were powerless to make a nomina
tion gives the act almost every feature of
a political crime."
The Republicans have eagerly helped to
circulate the denunciatory document.
. One ruil.hon and a half of the special flag
posters for display on flag day have been
distributed over the country within the
last week; and this morning an order for
half a iniilibn more vas given. There has
been a big demand from Chicago citizens.
CoJoiie'l Hahn is calling in his small army
df stump speakers so that they can reach
their homes in time to vote, especially in
the close States." Scores of the spell
binders were at headquarters to-day re
porting the outlook in. different sections of
the country. The men from Nebraska
who have spoken in Lincoln said the busi
ness men there, as well as in other parts
of the State, had a grievance against Mr.
Bryan because tie had not stayed at home
and talked to the people as Major McKin
ley has done,.so that all the business in
terests wnich- are benefited by traveling
crowds could have made money. This
feeling is said to havecostMr. Bryan ftianv
votes, especially in Lincoln. On behalf
of Chairman- Hanna Sergeant-at-Arms
Haskell wrote a letter to Chief of Po
ljce Badtnoch thanking him for the
"prompt and effective manner in whicli
you handled the disgraceful egg-throwing
affair during the Bryan parade of October
,27,-" and adding. "The Republican Na
tional Committee does not desire, nor has
it at any time ih rough the campaign, taken
any unfair or unmanly means of securing
votes for the Hon. Vfilliam McKinley."
A ielegram was received from J. E.
North of Omaha, Internal Revenue Col
lector, stating -that a member of a silver
smelting company in that city had $10,000
.to bet even on the election of Mr. Bryan.
:C. C. Viall, a stockbroker of this city,
.wired to Mr. North accepting the wager,
and he offer? to bet $15,000 to $5000 that
â¢McKinley will be elected.

THE SAN FRANCrSCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30. 1896.
AIKEN'S DESIGN
IS A MONSTROSITY
Architects Criticize the
Plans for the Postoffice
Building.
Gloomy, Dungeon â¢ Like Effect
Proposed for Ih2 New
Structure.
TOWERS OUT OF PROPORTION.
But There Is a Premise of Elegant
Appointments for Courtrooms
and Offices.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 29.â At last
the Supervising Architect has completed
his second design for the San Francisco
public building. The first design did not
please the people of San Francisco. The
plans were after the style of Italian
renaissance, and were drawn under the
immediate supervision of Jeremiah
O'Rourke, a talented Irish architect.
O'Rourke soon re3isned his official posi
tion, and was succeeded by William Mar
tin Aiken. Mr. Aiken is nothing if not
romantic. It win Oe remembered that he
I made a trip to California. He saw the
Mission Dolores, visited the Stanford Uni
versity at Palo Alto and resolved that the
halo of romance should surround his de
sign. He determined to give the building
a gloomy, dungeon-like effect, with low,
deep and dart grated and arched door
ways. But not too somber, however, so
he stuck two campanile towers on the
roof. â¢
The result baffles description. The Call
correspondent showed a photograph of
the design to a number of experts to-day.
"It is an architectural monstrosity,"
said one of the most famous architects in
the United States, the designer of several
| Government buildinfcd. "There nre cor
ner pavilions, but no center pavilion at
all. This gives the facade a severely
plain appearance. The center should have
been emphasized by a pavilion. The cor
ner pavilions should have been elevated
above the balustrano, with the center
pavilion towering above all. Yet we
might have forgiven all if the architect
had not surmounted the structure with
two monstrous toweis. It was evidently
his idea to give the building an Alaambra
effect. Ido not see much in his design to
| suggest "Spanish rennaissance," as he
I calls it. But if he wished to ornament his
I roof witli turrets he might have Letter
J arranged them. The Madison - square
â  Garden, New York, is castellated. There
j are at least five campanile towers, but
j they are arranged discriniinately. Be
| sides, these turrets on a roof garden thea
i tor are well enough. Tney are lighted
brilliantly to advertise the snow, but I
tuink turrets are singularly out of place
on a Government building. Uncle Sam
does not need to advertise his business.
The design is not appropriate. Another
objection 1 have is the row of square win
dows on the mezzanine floor.
'â¢You will observe that the large arche'J
doorways and windows of the ground
floor and the windows or the third floor
are out of all proportion to the small
square mezzanine windows. These small
mezzanine windows are only n't for the
attic."
Tnis opinion of an expert was concurred
in by other architects, who for professional
reasons reluctantly criticized the Govern
ment architect. Others who saw the pic
ture, although not versM in structural
technology, were almost moved to tears
when they beheld it. "Heavens," said
one, -'the arcliitect must have had two
turrets in stock he didn't know what to
do with, so he stuck them on his Spanish
renais-sance roof." Another layman sug
gested that the two high tuirets gave a
very realistic billy-goat effect. Another
wag said by erecting only one turret on
one end of these roots the tout ensemble
would be a la locomotive, or with three
turrets there would be a devilish piichtork
susgestion.
But Mr. .Aiken is apparently well
pleased with his design. Th 6 following
description was given out to accompany
tfie pUotograpus:
The new Federal building to be built on the
square bounded by Mission, Seventh and
Kievenaon streets Is to frerve not only as a City
Postoffice but al>o as a United States Court
house. The.l'o.-tofnce occupies ttie flrstjloor
and a portion of tne second, wUile tne third
floor anu part of the second will be devoted to
the courts and tiieir dependencies. On the
second floor will aUo be the offices lor the
United States Pension Agent, while the
Weather Bureau will occupy a partial roof
story in connection with thj towers.
The building above the first story is in form
like an nnguiar letter "V," with the ba^e,
wnicli forms the main facade, on Seventh
street. In the first story nud the courtyard
which is roofed, is the Postoffice working
room. Corridors run ihrough tne center of
each division parallel with the three streets
and give direct access to each department.
The officer of the Postmaster and Assistant
Postmas.ter lace Mission street, while on the
opposite side of this corridor is the registry
division. The Seventh-street corridor lihs
upononeside the screen containing the de
livery windows, boxes and mailing drops and
on the other the stamp and money-order de
partments and cashit-r's office.
The Stevenson-street cotridor gives access to
the working-room. At the junction of the
side and seventh-street corridors are piaced
the stairs and elevators, in near proximity to
tie principal entrances, and an iniormation
bureau for the benefit of iho general public is
lound at the corner of Mission and Seventh
streets, making the plan as a whole most com
plete and accessible.
The center of the Seventh-street side on the
third story is to be occupied by the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals, the highest
court of the district, while at Mission street,
or the southwest corner, is the Circuit Court,
and opposite, at Stevenson street, the District
Court. All the courtrooms are provided with
the necessary rooms for Judges, juries, cierks
and witnesses. The United States Attorney's
offices, two law libraries and a large fileroom
ior the various documents in charge of the
District Court are on this floor, and u>e United
States Marshal has a suite of rooms at the back
of the Stevenson-street wing, connected di
rectly with the ground by a private staircase.
On the second floor, under the District
Court and easily accessible therefrom, are the
rooms of the Grand Jury and Master in Chan
cery and a number of petty jury rooms. The
central part oi this floor is devoted to the use
of the railwayman service and postoffice in
spectors, while the pension office occupies the
southwest corner.
The Circuit Court of Appeals, as beflu its im
portance, will be the most elaborate room in
the building, finished in white enamel embel
lished with gold, with vaulted ceiling of or
namented plaster. The other courtrooms will
be handsomely nnished in various hard wooas,
as well as the connecting offices and libraries,
in which latter the bookenses will form a part
of the permanent decoration.
The corridors of the first story will have
vaulted ceilings finished in mosaic and orna
mented Dlaster, wnile below the springing of
the vaults the wails will be entirely of native
marble. The remainder of this story will .be
finisned in hard wood. The exterior of the
building, which is to be Spanish renaissance
in style, will be built of cream-white mabie,
severely plain in the lower stories, except
immediately around the entrance.*, but richly
decorated above the third-story stringer course
and capped by a deeply projecting cornice and
a balustrade of elaborate design. Crowning
all will rise two towers above the intersections
of the corridors on the southwest aud north
west corners. These towers, while adding
much to the appearance of the building, will
also serve a useful purpose, as they are in
tended to accommodate the apparatus and in
struments ol the local weather bureau.
The Call correspondent aÂ«ked.the su
pervising architect when work would be
commenced on the San Francisco post
office building. "Not for several months,"
said he.' "WÂ« are now engaged on tne
foundation plans and there are some en
gineering problems to be solved. We
must determine the weight that can be
supported by such a foundation before we
proceed.''
FLURRY IN THE MONEY MARKET.
High Rates of Interest Paid by Some New
York Speculators tor. Temporary
Loans.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 29.-The re
striction of accommodation by banks was
the duel factor in the money market
flurry to-day. Loans have been called in
in some instances in preparation for pos
sible demands for funds over Sunday. At
the opening 10 per cent was bid for call
money in the Stock "Exchange, and
although a few loans were made at that
figure there were no offers at any rate
and borrowers became more urgent in
their efforts to obtain accommodation, so
that shortly after noon money loaned at
50 per cent. In the afternoon banks that
had agreed to Joan money in the morning
canceled their contracts, maKing the
situation worse, and no money appeared
from any source when the rate reuched CO
per cent.
Then was supplied part of the demand
at that figure. This had little effect, and
the rate quickly advanced to 100 per cent,
that rale being paid on some loans to be
carried over until Wednesday. At the
extreme rate money for the first time ap
peared in large quantities.
Banks, however, loaned money freely to
regular customers at 6 per cent on the
basis of the volume of business done, but
were not disposed to furnish accommoda
tion to outsiders. The high rates for
money had but little effect on the prices
for stocks, and there was no excitement on
tne exchange.
A leading bank president, in speaking
of the advance in money rates, said that
the people most eager to have their money
in hand, and have it in tlie best money
that exists, are the smaller savings-bank
depositors.
"These people," he said, "are losing
their interest on deposits while securing
their principal in pold. Bryan tells them
that they want silver, bui tneir actions
say they want gold."
Gold received to-day per steamship Ha
vel, amounting to $1,235,000, was all de
posited by the houses receiving it with
the sub-treasury before noon. The action
of the bankers alluded to in placing their
gold with the Government to-day was re
garded by many a? an indication that this
hoarding process has about ruii its course,
and this tneory was partly brought out by
a decrease ( in the demand for gold over
the counters' of the bullion dealers.
CYCLONE IN MISSISSIPPI,
Houses Demolished and Trees of
All Sizes Uprooted by the
Wind.
Two Men in a Bugry H .ye a Startling
Experience With the Swirling
Elements.
OXFORD, Miss., Oct. 29.â A terrific
cyclone passed through the eastern part of
Lafayette County this afternoon, demol
ishing farmhouses and uprooting trees of
all sizes. The news just reached here
through Hon. W. V. tiullivan. Congres
sional candidate, and T. J. Harkins.
Sullivan had been speaking at Tulla and
was returning to Oxford. They were driv
ing a double team in a buggy. The wind
lifted their buggy, horses and all, and car
ried them some 200 yaris. The buegv
was utterly demolished by falling tim
bers, but neither men nor horses were se
riously hurt, though the men had part of
their clothing blown away. The storm
passed through the edge of the town of
Delay and demolished several houses.
Tae house of Milton Eskridge was blown
away, but his wife and several children
miraculously escaped with but slight
bruises. The extent of the damage can
not be givenj but no casualties have yet
been reported. Not a tree was left stand
ing in the cyclone's path. Further details
cannot be had to-night.
McCOOK, Nebr., Oct. 29.â A tremendous

FATAL EXPLOSION
IN A COAL MINE
Six Men Killed and Two
Badly Injured in the
Disaster.
Two Rescuers Who Go Down
in the Shalt Met Death
From Gas.
FLAMES RAGE IN THE MINE.
In Past Years the Colliery Has Been
the Scene of Some Terrible
Catastrophes.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., Oct. 29.â 8y an
explosion ot gas this afternoon in shaft 3
of the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Commer
cial Company's mine, six men were killed
and two injured. The dead are: "William
R. Jones, fire boss; John W. Josephs, as
sistant mine foreman; Thomas Owens;
VVilliam Lacey, contractor; James Her
ring, Joseph Worth.
Tne injured: David Williams, laborer,
overcome by gas; John Davis, laborer,
overcome by gas and bruised on the body.
Six others were brought to the surface
uninjured.
Wuen the explosion occurred William
Lacey, a contractor, was at work in a rock
tunnel, about a mile from the foot of the
shaft, with thirteen men. Immediately
after the explosion a rescuing gang was
organized by Fire Boss William R. Jones
snd Foreman John Joseph?. The men
proceeded down the shaft, Jones and
Josephs being far in advance. When about
one mile from the foot of the shaft they
stumbled over the bodies of Contractor
Lacey, Owens, Herring and Worth.
At this point Jones and Josephs were
overcome by back damp and fell dead in
their tracks. The other rescuers were
forced to beat a hasty retreat, bringing
the bodies of Jones and Josephs with
them.
A few hours later the air current was
partly restored nnd the men were able to
push their way into the tunnel, and at 8:30
they signaled that they had recovered the
bodies of the four rock miners. The res
cuers, with the bodies, were brought to
the surface shortly afterward.
There are several theories as to the
cause of the explosion. The mine is known
to be a dangerous one and extra precau
tions have always been taken to guard
against explosions. All the men at work
in the tunnel to-day carried safety lamps,
so it is not believed that the gas was ex
ploded from a naked lamp. The most
plausible theory is that the gas was ignited
by a blast.
The roof of the fanhouse was blown off
and the building otherwise damaged. The
shock of the explosion wa3 neard fully a
mile away. The mine is on fire, and will
cause the company much trouble and ex
pense before the flames can be subdued.
In past years this colliery has been the
scene of several bad explosions. The most
destructive occurred on Sundnv, March 9,
1890, by which eight miners were burned
to death in a most horrible manner, and
two years apo some of the members of the
New York Coal Exchange had a narrow
escape. A party of ten were on the car
riage and had been lowered a short dis
tance into the shaft when an explosion
took place near the foot. The carriage
was quickly hoisted out of the shaft just
in time to save the lives of the New
Yorkers.
WHEAT RISES ONE CENT,
Feverish Day Among the Traders
on 'Change at Chicago
Is Reported.
Many Changes in Quotations Made,
bat the Market Coses Much
Stronger.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct. 29â It was a fever
ish aay with wheat-traders on 'change
and prices were frequent and vigorous, the
gain at one time being 2% cents per
bushel. The cable news added to the
enthusiasm, Liverpool being quoted at an
advancs of l]4>i. Other r.able messages
from that place referred to the big busi
ness done yesterday in California wheat
â¢ior English account. Seven cargoes in all
were taken, live of them for Australia and
one each for Calcutta and the Cape. In
addition to the English advices New York
after the opening wired that both England
and the Continent were liberal buyers of
wheat futures. Added to theso reports
were telegrams stating that the Northwest
markets were stronger than those of Chi
cago and St. Louis.
But at noon New York reported a tre
mendous appreciation in the price of
money, together with statistics from Min
neapolis and Duluth, showing an increase
in rates there. Consequently wheat was
for sale and the price broke two cents off
the earlier figures.. A return of the money
scare seized the crowd, however, and
another reaction took place. When the
bell rang at the close of the day's busi
ness, the net gain in the principal cereal
had been 1 cent over yesterday's figures.
Tne market was lively enough to suit the
most rabid speculator. The closing price
for the December option was 71% cents.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 2?.â To-day's Con
tinental wheat markets were as follows:
Antwerp â Wheat opened firm on the
strength of English and American advices,
hut the market was lifeless, buyers being:
unwiliinsr to meet higher prices. The
market closed dull but steady.
Paris -The market opened week and
lower, bat became strong on the stimula
tion of American advices and prices ad
vanced, but buyers were shy in view of the
rocent collapse, aud the volume of busi
ness was small.
Berlinâ The market opened higher on
the strength of advices from America.
Wheat opened firm at fully 2 marks im
provement, the bears covered freely and
closed tirm at 2)4 to 3 marks above yester
day's closing. Holders were influenced
by the unfavorable advices regarding the
crops in India.
Budapest â There was a sensible advance
in wneat at tne opening, which had the
effect to restrict business.
Hamburg and Amsterdam â Market
firmer; Holders asking higher rates. Busi
ness limited.
The Danubian markets were quiet with
out movement. The rates were upheld.
The Russian markets were unchanged.

VANCOUVER NUGGET STORY.
The Wife of a Minister Is Getting Wealthy
Through the Energy of Her
Ducks.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Oct. 29.â G01d
nuggots have often been found in the
gizzards of British Columbia chickens â at
least stories to that effect have been circu
lated â but heretofore there has been a
vagueness about the stories in their chief
particulars. No one saw the nugget in tbe
gizzard of the chicken or ever heard of
the alleged man who told the story, but
now there is a brand new gold nugget
gizzard anecdote at hand, and this time
the authoress ii a well-Known minister's
wife, and it would b? both ungallant and
disrespectful to question the truth of the
statement.
Mrs. A. E. Green of Eburn, B. C, about
seven miles from Vancouver, informed a
local paper that on the 22d of October she
Killed a six-month-o!d duck that had
been raised in tlie parsonage yard, and
when dressing it was astonished to find
five tine gold nugget", to the value of
about $20, in its gizzard.
Last New Year's, Mrs. Green avers, she
found three gold nuggets in another duck,
nnd from that time she never killed a
duck without examining its interior ar
rangement for pay gravel. Now her rev
erend husband is raising a large flock of
ducks, which he will "grub stake " and
send out to prospect the neighborhood in
the vicinity of the parsonage.
Eburn is the little town close to Van
couver where gold in blnck cand was re
cently brought' up on a drill used'in bor
ing for water. There is known to be an
immense qaftatity of void dust and nug
gets carried ia . black sand on Lulu Island,
where Eburn is situated, but so far it has
been found too expensive to work with

ing and was met at the depot by a deloga

which was inadequate to hold the immense
throng. The interior of the building was
tastefully decorated by the ladies' com
mittee of the Republican club, noticeable
among the decoration being a large num
ber of yellow chrysanthemums, represent
ing the gold standard. At 7:20 an excur
sion train arrived from Suntu Maria and

The parade was tne largest a"nd best yet
seen here, and vast throngs of people
filled tne sidewalks. A noticeable feature
of the procession was the decorated car
riage in which Mr. Sclioon maker rode,
which . was drawn by two large gold
colored horses.
At the pavilion Mr. Schoonmaker was
introduced by the chairman of the meet
ing and received n salvo of applause. Ilia
address, on Republican principles, was at
tftntively listened lo and he was cheered
whenever he made a telling point.
The Republicans can pride themselves

fires he was escorted by citizens, headed
by a bra-ss band, to the hall, where hun
dreds were disappointed by not being able

tion for one who had labored so hard in
their interests.

J. Garver, chairman of the County Cen
tral Committee, and Mayor- George pre
sided. Upon the introduction of Senator

their bursts of enthusiasm. The speaker

here to give an account of his stewardship
for the people. He made many telling
points in favor of protection and sound
money and his remarks were interspersed
with amusing anecdotes apropos of the
occasion. His arguments were convincing
and concise in every detail and brought
many wavering Republicans to a realiza
tion of the necessity of upholding the
ticket.' Upon conclusion three rousing
cheers were given for the speaker and
McKinley.

was the largest and most enthusiastic
meeting of the campaign. Excursions of
citizens came from neighboring towns and
the Alhambra Theater was packed to the
doors. Mr. Scott first took up the ship
building industry, showing the effect of
protection on that industry and the gen
eral effect on this coast that the building
of the Charleston and San Francisco had.
He discussed the attack in the Democratic
platform upon the LTnited States Supreme
Court and showed the necessity of pre
serving that tribunal in its present posi
tion of independence and honor.
The condition of the American laborer
was compared with that of Asiatic and
European countries, showing what protec
tion has done for our laborers bot i in ro
spect towages and enjoyment of material
prosperity. The fallacy of cheap money
was illustrated by his history of the French
assignat and the demoralization, financial
and moral which followed it.

in the Llnited States Mr. Scott closed with
an eloquent plea for the Republican party
and its nominees. After a campaign song
by the Redwood City Glee Club the meet

posed to be here, are wanted in Santa
Barbara for elopemeiit and theft. A pri
vate detective agency has been trying to

dismay that their birds had taken railway
passage for unknown parts Tuesday morn
iner.
Wieland is a nephew by marriage of
Mrs. Ansill, and the latter, becoming en
amored of the boy, induced him to run off
with her. The woman deserted not only
her nusband, a wealthy agriculturist, but
also two children. Before tbe elopement
she collected a considerable sum of money
due her husband, who at that time was in
San Francisco, and this she took with her.
At present there is no dew to the guilty
pair.
GOLD MINING IN ALASKA.
Hundreds of New Claims Have Been Staked
Out and Many Miners Ars Making
Fortunes.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 29.â The best
discoveries of the season in the Yukon
country have been made on five creeks,
accordin? to Juneau papers Justin. These
aTe: Dead wood Creek, on which fifty new
claims are being worked; Mastodon,
Eagle, Harrison and Birch creeks. Sev
eral other good discoveries have been
foun'l, but they cannot be worked to ad
vantage until the ground is frozen.
John Howard purchased from Thomas
Anderson and other 3 for $2500 a claim on
Dead wood Creelr. He has worked seven
men steadily, and the latest reports say
lie has cleared $19,000 this year. Cbarle*
Harrington made one c!ean-up on a Mas
todon Creek claim which netted more
than the $0000 he paid for it. In both
these instances the former owners thought
the claims about worked out.
On Eaglo and Harrison creeks many
claims prospect high and miners antici
pate making big money as soon as the
ground freezes.
Two hundred claims have been staked
out in three gulches running into the
Cloudyke River, in British territory, and
old miners pronouuee this region to be
unusually promising.

ABOUT TO LEAVE
MONTEREY BAY
The Oregon Is Preparing to
Sail for San Fran
cisco.
Oaptain Howison Will Run No
Risk of Crossing the
Columbia Bar.
BAKNACLES STUD THE SHIP,
The Midnight TorpedcÃoat Attack
and Battalion Drill Ashore at
Sausalito.
Aboard the )
United States Battle-Ship Oregon, >
Montebey Bay, Oct. 29. )
A tower of black smoke rising high in
the calm sky and spreading out at the top
like the foliage of a giant shade treeÂ°is
now pouring from the yellow lunnels of
the Oregon. It is 4 o'clock in the after
noon, and the battle-ship is about to get
under way for San Francisco. Captain
Howison figures on getting off the beads
with plenty of time to spare so that he
can "fool around" a little if he wants to,
and go in across the bar at high water to
morrow morning. That kind of water is
very necessary to the Oregon. When she
is laden for a cruise, fully equipped and
with all the stores aboard, the Oregon
draws not less than 26 feet of watef. It
takes 42 tons to sink tlie ship an inch in
the water.
Owing to this fact there has been ex
pressea aboard the Oregon on her present
cruise some doubt as to whether the giant
battle-ship can get over the Columbia
River bar so as to steam up that river and
tbe raging Willamette, so as to receive
the set of beautiful silverware whidh the
people of Portland have had especially
made for the namesake of their State.
There is just about that depth of Water on
the bar.
The Oregon will make her first cruise
north probably not before next spring, but
if she is in command of her present com
mander, Captain H. I. Howison, she will
run no risks in crossing the Columbia bar.
As much as the captain and the wardroom
mess would like to have that silverware
they love deep water and fear the sea's
bottom more.
So that it is quite possible that the Ore
gon'a sideboards will not glitter with the
silverware unless it is sent down to deep
sea to her by a delegation of prominent
Webfoot citizens on a tug or other vessel
of iierht draft. There is no drydock on
the Pacific Coast capable of taking the
Oregon in when equipped, except the new
Government drydock at Port Orchard on
Puget Sound. There are whiskers four or
five inches long and a studding of bar
nacles on the ship's sides and bottom. She
should have been in the drydock some
time ago. It was partly on account of her
foul bottom that on her present cruise the
ship made only about seven knots the first
day and eight to nine knots the second
day with tbe same number of boilers, the
grass having been considerably washed
away.
The captain is going to burn three boil
ers on trie run back, and she will probably
be let out a little more than on the way
down. The navy regulations require a
ship going into port to make U report on
that port. . Tbe report on Monterey is
not very extensive. Two of the things
that Assistant Secretary of the Navy Me-
Adoo will be told about Monterey is that
freshwater for ships is about 50 cents a
gallon, and that the surf is ordinarily
rather heavy for landing parties in ships'
boats.
Executive Officer Drake turned out this
morning with the idea that he would clear
tbe ship for action, and the news leaked
out to the dock, either through the port
hole in the first lieutenant's stateroom or
from the wardroom mess. But after a
time the crew found that the news was a
flash in the pan.
The first lieutenant, who is a descendant
of Admiral Drake of the English navy,
had changed his mind. This is another
spectacle that will be reserved for Sausa
lito to-morrow morniHe. where the ship
will come to ancnor. The midnignt* at
tack by torpedo-boats and the battalion
drill ashore will also take place at and off
Sausalito, which seems to be getting more
attention from the Oregon than all the
rest of California.
Just after the menses had had their cof
fee last nizht and were finding an easy
position with cigars or pipes fire quarters
were sounded. This is an exercise that
must be gone through with, even on iron
ships, though there is hardly a thing
aboard tbe Oregon outside the powder in

the magazines that would burn, except
the bedding and tbe lubricating oil.
This is a very lively drill. The crew
springs to it swiftly. Everyman aboard
without a single exception has his partic
ular station. All tlie water-tight doors be
tween oecks are shut to prevent a draft,
men rush everywhere with hose and the
powder division stands by the magazines
fnr below ready to open the floodcocksand
flood the magazines in case the lire should
get into that vicinity. Beyond that there
were no drills, and the night was unevent
ful. The finest battle-ship in the world
rode tne calm bosom of Monterey Bay on
a gentle swell with a calm and starry night
around ana above, while some of the offi
cers went ashore.
Among the visitors In the afternoon
were Dr. .Tnmes L. Or<i of Monterey iind
Mr. and Mrs. Philip W. Stanford of San
Francisco and New York. To-day the in
cessant drilling and exercises began enrly.
After quarters there was divisional drill
with the batteries. The big guns and the
heavy turrets are now being revolved,
pointing fore and af"t and athwart ships
as easily as turning spools of thread. The
infantry saber, settihg up and other drills
followed in succession for two hours. One
of the ludicrous sights of these occasions
is that of an officer giving a Chinese
â waiter a lesson in infantry tactics. The
Chinaman grasos the gun all right, but as
to grasping tbe idea of drilling, that is
beyond the range of the thirteen-inch
guns.
The improvement in the drilling iÂ«
marked. Captain Howison says thisafterJ
noon that he is ready for the official in*
spection of the Oregon and the efficiency
of her crew, which will bÂ« made soon aftef
the ship's return to San Francisco.
Nicholson, the man who struck Sailo*
Tiedorman with a long handled scru&brush
and fractured his skull, is still imprisoned
in the brig, pending the result of Tiedtr
man's injuries. If his victim dies he will
be turned over to the San Francisco civil
authorities for criminal treatment. If
Tiederman recovers Nicholson will have
to stand a military court-martial, which
has been recommended by Captain Howi
son. Tiederman was taken to the German
Hospital instead of to the Mare Island
Hospital.
It is getting thick: outside and the

SANTA BARBARA ROBBERY
Stage Company's Safe Cracked
at Midday and Its Contents
â  Stolen.
Officers Believe the Thbf Is a Resi
dent and an Expert at the
Business.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 29.âBe
tween 12 and 1 o'clock to-day a daring
robbery was pf rpetrated in the Santa Bar
bara stage ollice. J. B. Leach, manager of
the company, had stepped out to lunch,
leaving the 'office doors open, as was' his
wont, but the big safe locked with the day
combination on. The robber opened the
safe and possessed himself of about $80, a
good portion of this money being scattered
through fifteen envelopes which had been
sent in frorii various eating stations along
tne line. Each of these envelopes was
found torn open and rilled.
. The Sheriff and his force are looking for
the safecracker, who is evidently an ex
pert in his line. Leach was absent an
hour, but the office was only deserted for
some fifteen or twenty minutes of that
time. Two stablemen were working in
the stable 'at the rear all the time. Three
months ago the stable was looted at night
and a similar turn taken. Officers believe
I that the same man did both jobs and that
he i&a resident of Santa Barbara, who by
some means was -enabled to posses* him
salf of the day combination of the leek. â¢
MURDER MYSTERY SOLVED.
Through a Torn Scrap of Paper the
. Identity of James Biggs and His
Son Is Established.
' PORTLAND, Or , Oct. 29.â The identity
oi the two men whose dead bodies were
found near Red Rock on the old Surprise
Valley trail in Lassen. County, Cal., in
the early part of September was estab
lished'to-day in Portland through a letter
from the District Attorney at Susanville
to the clerk of. the Circuit Court making
inquiries about the Case of Biggs vs
Goodenough. A torn scrap of paper, a
receipt for a fee for filing the complaint,
but with the name of the party to whom
issued 'missing, has furnished the infor
mation for which the Susanville authori
ties have been looking ever since Sep
tember 10, when the finding of tbe bodies
was rep rted. â 
The" men who were killed are James
Biggs and his son, aged 19 years, who left
here a year ago last spring. They worked
here for some months. Biggs and his
son were from lowa. They spoke of hav
ing a family of relatives back there, but
did not mention any particular locality.
Bigss and his son were -shot- to death
while around a camprire; Appearances
indicated that the murderer ha<4 tried to
cremate the bodies after robbing them.
The men were entire strangers in that
country and the supposition was that
they were killed by foreigner^ who were
herding sheep. Two of the men known
to be in the srang nf terward sold a band
of sheep at Reno," Nev. The suit men
tioned in the slip ot the receipt for a fee
was a mechanic's lien brought by Biggs
and two companions for labor performed.
The case was dismissed May 17, 1895. Be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1896.
THE PHOENIX CLUB
"WHOOPS IT UP" ÄÃ
Thus the Chairman Ex
presses the McKinley
Enthusiasm.
Colonel Taylor and Ex-Congress
man Stowell Speak to
the Point
THE ACT OF 1873 ELUCIDATED.
Many Candidates on Handâ Busy Prep-
aration for the Great Satur
day Parade.
Greek and red fire, skyrockets and pyro
technics galore. This was the introdirc
duction to the grand rally of the Phceoix
Club, held at Scottish Hall last evenine.
It was undoubtedly one of the best meet
ings of the campaign.
The assemblage' was addressed by
Colonel C. L. Taylor, ex-Congressman
Police Judge Charles A* Low,
Stowell of Minnesota, Georpe Elder and
many other?.
In a terse but well-worded speech Chair
man Shaben introduced Colonel Taylor as
"tbe next Mayor of San Francbco." As
Mr. Taylor rose to address his audience he
was greeted with hearty applause.
"I am often asked," he said, after a few
words of greeting, "to say what I will do
if I am elected Mayor. Now this ques
lien, I must confess, is rather hard to
answer, but I will tell you what I am goinp
to do if I am elected Mayor by reading you
an interview I had with a Call reporter,
published last Saturday."
Colonel Taylor then read the interview
as published in The Call, at tiroes mak
ing comments upon certain points. Hg
was frequently interrupted by the enthusi
asm of his hearers, which boiled up and
found vent in cheers, yelling and* stamp
ing of feet.
"In conclusion." soid Colonel Tayor. "I
wish to ask you to stand steadfast for Re
publican principles and prosperity, and
we will roil ud in this City a majority for
McKinley and protection of 10,000 voies."
Colonel Taylor took his seat amid the
most .intense enthusiasm. He was fol
lowed by Charles A. Low, candidate for
Police Judge, who was also warmly
greeted. He said :
"It is not becoming in a candidate for a
judicial position to say much about him
self. His acts should speak for him. In
fact the less a Judge says anywhere the
better.
"A man should be fairly tried and dis
charged or pronounced guilty, as the case
might be. He should not be scored. The
law does not require it. When he steps
outside the law and in his private person
ality gives a man a tongue-lashing he
does something entirely unnecessary and
something:' a man never lorgets."
Judge Low ended by prophesying that
the duties of Polio Judge would soon fall
It-ss hard upon the incumbent, because as
soon as McKinley it elected prosperity
will reign and popr men have less in
centive to crime and drunkenness.
Georce Elder was the next speaker.
His introduction by the chairman was the
signal for loud calls and cheers.
"You all know me," said Elder, "and
you know my record. If I am elected I
can do no more than I have already done
for the last two years. If I cm elected I
am going to run the office of Superinten
dent, of Streets upon a business basis,
something that has not been done for a
long lime.
"In pursuing the course dictated by
duty I may have made fome enemies, but
if so it has been done in the interest of
the City. No man should leel sore at de
feat caused by discharging his duty."
Short speeches were then made by O.
K. McMurray, candidate for Justice of'the
Peace, and William T. Kibbler and Charles
E. Fredericks, candidates for the school
directorship, and then, with the large as
semblage inotitine and cheering and
stamping, ex-Congressman W. H. Stowell
of Minnesota acknowledged the introduc
tion of the chairman.
"Your chairman has told you that I
voted for the act of J873, and will have
something to say to you about it. Yes. I
vot^d for the act of 187-J, and I shall have
something to say to you tbout it."
After referring to the great business de
pression of the country and the causes
therefore. Mr. Stowell referred to the
Chicago platform as a mixture of Alt
geidism, Tillmanism and anarchism.
"I was a member of Contrress in 1873,"
said Congressman Stowell, "and I voted
for the Sherman act. I have never re
gretted it either, and I think it was one of
the best measures that ever passed Con
gress. If it was not why has no member
of Congress in these twenty-three years
tried to repeal it?
"The Bryanites try to make the public
believe it was passed by secrecy and
stealth. That is perfect nonsense. The
bill was printed eleven times and was up
in various forms something like seventy
nine times before rive sessions.
'â Gentlemen, if, as Bryan promises, under
free silver the dollar will advance to {1 29
in value wny don't the Democrats buy up
all the bullion in the country? They
would make untold fortunes if Bryan's
words are true and he is elected. '-But they
know his words are untrue and he won't
be elected."
After Congressman Stowell had done
speakinir, the following mule short ad
dresses on their own candidacy: T. J.
Sullivan, candidate for the Assembly
from the Thirty-first; Edward Aigeltin
ger, for Supervisor from the Twelfth
Ward; Edward L. Head. Phil Hammond,
Dr. Drucher and J. H. Powers, for School
Directors; M. W. Welch, for Senator
from the Twenty- third; Leon Jones, for
the Assembly from the Thirty-ninth; C.
X, Bonestellj for Superior Judge.

pator and Presidential hero of the nine

the pre-ent campaign in Washington. He
has stumped the State of Washington for
McKinley and made a marked impression
wherever he has spoken.

BOLTED OVER
THE CHARTER
A Lively Meeting of the
California Labor 1 Con
vention.
Several Delegates Very Bitterly
Opposed Its Condem
nation.
DISCUSSED MANY NEW LAWS.
Legislative Candidates Will Be Called
Upon to Place Themselves
on Record.
For a while there were lively times at
the meeting of the California Labor Law
convention, which convened at 915%
Market street last evening, and the tur
moil resulted in a number of the deleeates
bolting rather than being compelled to
vote in condemnation of the ihjw charter.
The stand of the bolting element was
not in favor of tbe proposed document,
but the men did not want to vote upon a
matter on which they had not received
instructions from their respective unions.
At the previous meeting a committee
was selected to examine into the merits
bf the labor laws proposed by the trades
unions and by Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald. Last evening the committee
made its report, ana near the end asked
the convention to make some recommen
dation relative to the new charter.
P. H. McCarthy at once moved that a
resolution be passed condemning the char
ter from first to last. Several delegates
oppo.sed the motion, stating that the con
vention was called for the purpose of
amending and creating laws for the bene
fit of the laboring classes, and not for the
purpose of discussing politics or munici
pal affairs,
A reading of the call for the convention
substantiated this statement, but for all
that it brought out a lively little storm.
W. McArthur, A. Furuseth and McCar
thy tired hot shot into the camp of those
who or-posed the resolution.
While McArthur and McCarthy were
using such words as "cowards" and
"afraid," a body of the Building Trades'
delegates left the bail, declaring that a
condemnatory action would break up the
convention. The other element prevailed
and tiie charter was duly condemned.
The other business was relative to labor
laws. No action was taken upon the pro
posed amendment of the mechanics' lien
law, as the National trades unions have
the matter in hand.
An adverse decision was taken upon the
act providing for the branding of all
articles made by convicts, on the ground
that it virtually recognizes the right of
convicts io manufacture goods in competi
tion with tree labor.
Act No. 13, providing that nopeison not
a citizen of the United States shall be em
ployed upon State or municipal work,
called out a heated argument, but it was
approved by a vote of 19 to 12.
An amendment to the statutes exempt
ing certain properties from attachment
and seizure, providing that the wages of
sailors apd fishermen also be exempt, was
approved. It was recommended that
Labor day be changed to the first Monday
in September.
It wus also recommended that Boards
of Supervisors be petitioned to refuse to
grant liquor licenses to saloon-keepers who
comluct employment bureaus.
Adverse action was taken on the recom
mendation that stonework on municipal
noil tracts should be done only in the coun
ties paying for the improvements.
It was decided to send letters to all can
didates for the Senate and Assembly, re
questing that tuey attend the next meet
ing of the labor convention and sign a
pl<Â»dpe to support the proposed iaws
favored by the convention. The body will
meet again next Sunday morning.
A PINK-ROSE LUNCHEON
Mrs. Fisher Ames Delightfully
Entertains Twenty-Two
Ladies.
A Congenial Company Discusses an
Elaborate Menu Amid Artistic
Surroundings.
To Mrs. Fisher Ames belongs the honor
of the first elaborate entertainment of the
season.
Twenty-two ladies assembled yesterday
at 1 o'clock at the Ames residence, 1414
California street, in response to luncheon
invitations. The company was a con
genial one, the menu delicious, the deco
rations artistic and, last but not by aay
means least, the hostess tactful and
charming. Under these conditions it was
impossible that the luncheon should be
otherwise than it wasâ an unqualified
success.
Pink was the prevailing tone of the
decoration. In the center of the large
round table was an immense bed of pink
rosebuds, four feet in diameter. Fink
rose 3 were strewn with artistic careless
ness here and there on the satiny damask
and pink candles in silver candelabra shed
a soft radiance over the exquisitely ap
pointed table.
Everywhere in the handsome dining
hall there were vases and bowls filled with
fragrant pink blossoms, and in the ad
joining dra wing- room the same decora
tions prevailed.
Seated at tbe table were Mrs. Hager,
MrÂ«. Foutes, Mrs. Edward Martin, Mrs.
McKenna, Mrs. Tatum, Mrs. Coit, Mrs. I.
L. Requa, Mr.-. \V. I\ Morgan. Mrs. W. L

COOK'S ANSWER.
He Wns Special Counsel for the Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers
in the Worden C'ate.
Carroll Cook has sent the following let
ter to The Call in reply to resolutions
adopted by the American Railway Union,
advisinc his defeat because he appeared
as special counsel for the prosecution of
Harry A. Knox, Thomas Compton, John
Mullen and S. D. Worden for the murder
of Engineer Clark and four United States
soldiers during the great railroad strike of
1804. .
Mr. Cook on that occasion was em
ployed by and appeared for the Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers and was
not Irs the service of the Southern Pacilic
Company at all. His letter is as follows:
To the Editor of the Ca'l-SiR: The inclosed
excerpt from this morning's Call, showing
i
the action taken by the American Railwa
Union Â»t a meeting held yesterday, explains Â«
itself. Knowing that you have always stood
in this community for law and order I respÂ»ct- ,
fully ask that you take this matter up and
make such defense of me as you see fit for hav
ing fully dischnrged the duties of my profes
sion, fam confident that the citizens in this
community v.ho favor law and order will not
permit an organization, which attempts to
indorse such an assassination as was com
mitted at Woodland of an innocent engineer
and United States soldiers performing their
duty, to defeat a candidate, objected to solely
because of his having performed his duty
under his sworn oath as an attorney and
counselor-at-ljiw.
In the railway strike cases tried at Wood
land in 1894 Judge J. W. Armstrong of Sacra
mento was employed by and represented the
Southern Pacific Company, Mr. Hatch ap
peared as District Attorney, and I was em
ployed and appeared on behalf of the Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers (a railway em
ployes' organization) to which Samuel Clark,
the engineer who was killed, belonged.
In those cases I permitted nn in justice to be !
done any one. Newspaper articles containing
my argument and showing mv conduct in the
trial of the cases will fully bear me out in this.
The defendants, and each and every one of
them, at tbe conclusion of each trial thanked
me for the fair and impartial manner in which
I had prosecuted the cases. 1 allowed no im
proper evidence to be introduced and tried
the cases strictly upon legal evidence with the
result that S. D. Worden was convicted and his
conviction subsequently sustained by the
Supreme Court of the State.
The morning papers of July 19,1894 (The
Call in particular and the t^aaraniento Bee)
give an account of the'eommencement of pro
ceedings a,t Woodland and show clearly that I
appeared in those cases as a representative, not
of ihe Southern Pacific Company, but of ihe
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. F. V.
Meyers, chairman ol that organization, who
resides in this City, at 338 Cnpp street, will
fully bear me out in tnis assertion. In the
newspapers of that date, and especially in the
Sacramento Bee, will be found my argument
at the preliminary examination, wherein I
differed with other counsel who were asso
ciated with me in prosecuting the case; and,
although contending thÂ«t the defendants ac
cused should be hela to answer, I repudiated
the contention of other counsel in the case
that every member of the American Railway
Union was guilty. Yours truly,
Cakkoll Cook.
The folio wine; is corroborative:
San Francisco, Oct. 28, 1896.
Carroll Cook, Attorney at Lawâ Dkak Sik: I
have your request ot even date, viz. : That I
procure for you a copy of the resolution of
subdivision No. 283, Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers, authorizing your employment
as special counsel to represent the said subdi
vision in the prosecution of those who were
responsible for the derailment of the passen
ger train at trestle tw<> miles west of Sacra
mento, on July 11. 1894, whicn derailment
resulted in the death oi Engineer Sam Clark, a
member of the subdivision immed.
I have twken steps to procure the copy asked
for, and as soon as it is at hand will forward it
to you.
In this connection I will add that, being
one who, in connection with a committee ol
two of tne members of I.eland Stanford Divi
sion No. 283, opened the negotiations between
yon and the suDdivUion, that resulted in your â 
employment as special counsel, as named
above," I am in a position to say that, as suca
special counsel, you acted as the representa
tive only of the subdivision named. One Of its
members had been murdered, ana it was the
desire of the subdivision, while laying not one
finger's weight on any innocent man, to do ell
possible to bring those who were guilty to
justice. Hence your employment. Yours
truly, P. V. Meyers,
Chairman, G. C. A.. B. L. E.. S. P. System.
AMONG THE MINERS,
Return of Samuel M. Shortridge
From a Trip in the
Mountains.
Honest and Sturdy Representatives
of the Typical Gold Diggers Are
Solid for McKinley.
Samuel M. Shortridge returned last
night, alter a week's successful campaign
ing in remote and out-of-the-way mining
districts of Amador, Calaveras and Tuo
lumne counties.
These are the historic regions from
which BrefHarte drew the materials for
his charming idyis of Californian life be
fore the chief industry of the State was
changed to fruit-raising, but the same
whole-souled, open-handed, brave miner is
there to-day in the canyons and among
the pine-clud hills. â 
Mr. Shortridge reports that he is more
than pleased with the result of his mis
sionary work among the hard-working
miners. He was cordially received, and
what he had to say was attentively lis
tened to.
He was gratified to find that a great
change of sentiment had taken place
within the last few weeks in favor of pro
tection and its apostle, McKinley. Every
where he went he found the most enthusi
astic audiences and a strong feeling in
favor of the Republican electors.
He reports that this leeling exi-sts pretty
generally in Sntter Creek, Angels Camp,
Sonora, Mokelumne Hill, Jackson, San
Andreas and several other places which
he visited or heard from. Hence he re
turns in excellent spirits feeling rifre^hed
and rejuvenated from his trip* through
the mountains where the miners delve for
gold.

Election November 3. 1896.
All is ready.
To-morrow we parade.
Get all your banners in order.
Old Glory will arouse the patriotic.
Tom Reed will be received with a jubi
lee.
It will be a solid procession of solid
men.
Arrange for a half holiday and make it
a festival.
It needs no straw to show the way the
wind is blowing ibis year.
L n t Old Glory float from every building.
We can never be too patriotic.
The Bryanite whine of coercion is lost
:n the glad shout of Republican victory.
â¦
Don't be content to stand for McKinley
when you can get out and march for him.
Spenker Reed will find enthusiasm
prepared for him and ready to blaze up.
A few days more and Bryanism will be
ns dead a duck as any canard that ever
flew. .
The path to prosperity is plain before us
and the lamp of experience lights the
way.
Every good citizen will answer M:Kin
ley's appeals to patriotism by a patriotic
vcte.
The Bryanites should come ont to-mor
row, see tbe parade and get an object
lesson.
It is expected there will be 30,000. men
in line on Saturday, but we ought to make
it 50,000. ___^__
About all that is left of the agitation
now is the shiver and the tremble of the
agitators.
Libelers may caricature the features of
Colonel Taylor, but they cannot assail his
character.
Tnere is no discount on the American
workingman, and he will allow no dis
count on his dollars.
There is hirdly a good shoot left in the
Bryanite camp. They seem to be almost
out oi lungs over t: ere.
Tne sentiment of San Francisco will be
expressed, to-morrow and the votes on
election day will confirm it.
The cry of coercion is so much like a
fish, story that the Bryanites don't even
try to tell the truth about it.
The best kind of it sweep is a cleah
sweep. Let us make it a straight Repub
lican victory all along the line.
The industries of San Francisco depend
on protection, and no workingman should
vote to-eend a free-trader to Congress.
To make San Francisco a thoroughly
Republican city we must give her tue ad
vantage of a thoroughly Republican
Mayor.
The Fryanites may bane ont then ban
ners to-morrow if they wish; the sup
porters of McKinley will have all the
musip and the shoutinc.
Chairman Hanna ba3 a good way .of
predicting thing?. He estimates that
sixty one votes in the electoral college
will be "probably Democratic" .

The ftisionists are bendihg evry effort
to obtain control of the next Senate, and
Brysn will be traded off tor the legislative
ticket in every State where a Senator is to
' . be electtd.
While we welcome our Democratic
allies in tiiis contest we must not leave
the battle too much to them. It is to be a
Republican victory and must Re a Repute
lican fight.
Baltimore declares she will show a
grsater Democratic revolt from the Chi
cago platform than any other city in thÂ«
land, but ban Francisco will either beat
hef or push her miehty close.
The course taken by the Bryanite ora
tors anti organs forces upon the people
' tbe question of law and order as the chief
issue of. the campaign. All Bryanites are
not lawless, but all lawless men are for
him.
Altgeld advocates tbe free coinage of
Bilrer, but he requires all who rent his
buildings or borrow his money to make an
expre>s contract to pay in gold. He may
try to humbug others but he doesn't hum
bug himself.
Republicans and honest-money Demo
crats of New York, being assured of carry
ing the State for McKinley, have now set
themselves to the task of carrying every
county, and it would not be a bad idea to
bee how near we can come in California to
equaling the success achieved in the Em
pire State.
A PARADE OF FREE MEN.
The immediate anU immense success
which has attended the adoption by the
committee of arrangements for the great
| parade of the little strip of ribbon to be
worn on coat lapels and Dearinjr the words,
"I will parade on October 31, 1896, for Mc-
Kinley and Hobart and sound money,"
should be enough to convince every one that
the parade will be not only a great success,
but that it will be a parade of free men.
Cowards and sneaks and slaves are not
enthusiastic upon any subject, and hence
wherever genuine enthusiasm is to be
found it is tbe best evidence of voluntary
action on the jart of those who,display it
The citizena of San Francisco, of every
class, vocation and condition in life, are
enthusiastic upon the subject ot the great
parade next Saturday, and are villingly
and proudly displaying the badges which
declare their purpose to take part in the
procession.
If another proof were needed of the
success and significance of this great
demonstration it can be found in the
attitude of the enemies of the Republi
can party toward it. By every sort
of unfounded slander, by every kind of
m can insinuation, by every unworthy
and contemptible subterfuge, they are
endeavoring to diminish the glory
and to destroy the ereat significance of
this parade. The suggestion that those
who take part in it .should carry and those
who observe it should display the Ameri
can flag as evidence of their loyalty and
favor toward the Republican party has
been howled at by every demagogic and
journalistic cur, who hates the Republi
can party mainly because of its unswerv
ing devotion to American principles and to
tbe American flag.
The evident intention of a very large
percentage of the wapp-earners of San
Francisco to indicate publicly their party
favor by taking part in this great
Republican parade has been made a
text for the ab-urd and utterly unwar
ranted claim that they are being co
erced by their employers, and for the far
more contemptible and insulting sugges
tion tbat they should manifest one pur
pose in the parade and anot her at tne polls.
The moral obliquity of those .vho are sug
gesting this sort of political viUainy Is as
surprising as it is humiliating to the
minds of men who expect nobler things
from their political enemies and who
have not looked for such an absence of
conscience and decency among men who
call themselves Caliiornians or who as
sume to represent the manhood ana the
morals of the State.
The great parade of to-morrow after
noon wiil put the stamp of disapproval
and the seal of shame upon- every slander
which has been uttered against the man
hood of those who ' Will take part in it. It
will be eminently a procession of free j
men, and beyond all question it will '
be one of the greatest demonstra
tions which the State of Califor
nia has ever known. It will be
made up of the representatives ot every
industry, of every enterprise and of every
trade and occupation in Central Califor
nia. From the cities, towns, villages,
factories, farms and colleges within
a hundred miles of San Francisco
will come crowds and companies of
enthusiastic men, of every age and
of every calling, eager to swell the
ranks and increase the success of the
parade.
The enthusiasm which will overflow ]
from its participants and infect the ap
plauding thousands of its observers wfH"
be no simulated enthusiasm of men who are '
making a cowardly pretense of treason to
their convictions. On the contrary, every
banner, every transparency^ every burst
of music and every responding -shout
from the vast throng of marching men
will convince every beholder and every
listener that .the paraders will vote as they
march. The procession will be a splendid
and assuring presage of Republican vic
tory or. Tuesday next, to be achieved Dy
the votes of American freemen, such as
those who will be found manifesting their
purpose by marching in this great parade.

New Tork.
MAKE VICTORY CERTAIN.
The last duty that remains lo Republi
can county committees is tbut of provid
ing for the full vote of the party on elec
tion day. That duty is "of the highest
importance. The contest of argument has
resulted in Republican success, but the
contest of ballots has yet to be fought out,
and victory in the end will be not to those
who have converted most voters at the
mass-mee.tings, but to those who bring
most voters to the polls. -
Republican leaders in every section of
the State should begin at once, if they
have not already done so,, to make ar
rangements to bring all the voters of the
party out on election day. Nothing that
energy can make sure should be left to
chance or fortune. Every man who thinks
right should be brought out to vote right.
This duty should have the special care
of Republicans of the interior counties.
In the cities it is comparatively easy to
get voters to the polls, but in the country
districts it is sometimes difficult. This is
especially so if the weather is bad. Closely
contested campaigns in important States
have been sometimes determined by the
condition of the weather on election day.
It is certain if tbe day should be stormy
next Tuesday many voters who live at a
distance from their polling- places wiil be
tempted to stay at home, and it is for the
party leaders to see to it that they do not
in this way neglect their duty as citizens.
California can be carried for McKinley
by a good majority if every friend of pro
tection and sound money is ready to do
his full share in the work. In the doubt
ful States of the East a man has been
assigned to every square mile of tbe rural
districts, who ha 3 volunteered to see that
all the sound-money men in his section go
to the polls.
Something like that might be done iv
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1896.
the rural districts of California. We call
the attention of county committees to the
importance of adopting some such plan.
The time for making arrengements is
short and the work of preparation should
not be delayed a day.
They have made you poor by stopping
the factories. They have inatie y v
poor by taking away your work and
wages, and now they propodfe to make
you rich by a card trick, by calling
50 cents a dollar. Kven that won't
help some of you if you have been
brought very low, because the dollar
they want to double is not here. I say
it is no better than a card trick; it Is
simply a sort of legerdemain. It is the
sleight-of-hand man's proposition.
What you first want is work. How Is
the free-silver programme to bring that
work to you?â Benjamin Harrison.
LET THE FLAG WAVE.
Since the fusion managers have cr.lled
upon the Biyanites to fly the National
flag on Saturday, let them do so. No
Republican should grudge then, this op
portunity to display what patriotism they
have, even if they do so only to cover tne
â  i>cornfHure of their party. Let the flag
fly on that day from every building alon^
the march of the grand parade. Let every
citizen display the National colors to tne
best advantage and to the fullest extent.
CKd Glory can never be seen too often nor
too much, and its display never fails to
awaken a feeling of loyalty in all Ameri
can hearts.
The supporters of McKinley will have
abundant opportunity to display their
strength in the grand proces>ion which is
to march down the streets. They can
mnnifest their loyalty and their patriotism
by the banners they bear in their hands
and by the swelling strains of patriotic
music to which they keeD step. They can
show their enthusiasm by their s outs and
songs, and the popular favor with which
their cause is regarded can be manifested
in the proloneed acclamations which will
accompany the marchers from the ap
plauding thousands on the sideuaiks.
As we w Icome the flag displayed from
Bryanite supporters so also will wfe wel
come the attendance" in this City of peo
ple Irom the country who support Bryan.
Let everyDody in the State come to town
who can p< ssibiy do so. The sight will be
worth seeing even by tho*e who are op
posed to McKinley. It will be for them'
an object lesson which will teach them
clearly the state of public opinion in this
City and to a greater or less extent
throughout all California.
It will be worth their while to study it.
Thoy will see in the class and in the char
acter of the men who are marching on that
day what elements of society i re opposing
Bryanism, and to' those of reflecting minds
among them it will be convincing proof
that the people of tbis country are not yet
prepared to follow agitators or ev&n to
toierate them when they go too far iv
their appeals to prejudice and passion.
Let the flag fly. Let the people coin?.
It will hurt nobody to do honor to Old
Glory, or to welcome Tom Reed. It is al
together fitting and proper that the dis
p!Â»y of National patriotism should, be
made as nearly unanimous as possible.
We are on tbe eve of a new era of prosper
ity. The bard times ore passing away and
the repeal of the foolish Democratic legis
lation will bring back the welfare of the
people. It is rieht there should be some
thing of a festival in celebration of this
return of tzood for all.
Financial policies may come and .go,
tariff and free trade may succeed each
other with their revolutions and their
eras of prosperity; If we make a mis
take in finance we will get out of it;
but if we once establish in this country
of ours the doctrine that the laws of the
United States can only be enforced in
any State by the consent and co-opera
tion of.the Governor, we hare wiped out
our great history; we have dragged the
flag in the dust, we have destroyed our
constitutional system of government,
and that once destroyed, ouce turren
tlered, we may never be able to re
cover. â Benjamin Harrison.
THE POSTAL-CARD BALLOT.
The surest evidence of the election of
McKinley and Hobart is to be found in the
state of public opinion. The elements op
posed to Bryan constitute such an over
whelming majority of the people of the
United States, including Democrats as
well as Republicans, that it is impossible
for him and the ngitators who are .back of
him to make headway against them. If
any further evidence were needed it would
be found in the postal-card ballot taken
by the Chicago Record. That ballot has
just been closed and the result confirms
the observation of intelligent citizens.
The ballot taken by the Record includes
240,000 votes, received from twelve States.
A count of the vote shows that McKinley
received 173,501, Bryan 60,235 and Palmer
3683. Amor.X the twelve States were tne
so-called doubtful ones of Tennessee, Mis
souri, Kansas. Nebraska, Michigan and
Indiana. According to the poll none of
these States can any longer be considered
doubtful.
In Missouri, where the combination be
tween Popuiistsand Democrats had hoped
to overwhelm the Republican ticket, they
polled but 9149 votes, against 9908 for Mc-
Kinley. In Bryan's own State, Nebraska,
he received but 2182 votes, against 5371 'or
his opponent. Kansas gave McKinley
6941. against 3534 f0r Bryan, vhile Indiana
gives 13,973 for McKinley, against 5710 for
Bryan.
The Chicago vote was exceptionally sur
prising. It was believed that thÂ« large
Altgeld following among the discontented
would enable the Bryanites to carry the
citr. Tne poll, however, shows that Mr.
Bryan received but 14,179 votes, while Mc-
Kinley received 67,795.
It is true that vhis postal-card ballot was
taken from that class of people who are at
least intelligent enough to know how to
read and write, and does not represent
the ignorant portion o! the community.
Nevertheless, as the great majority of the
American people are intelligent and edu
cated, it may be fairly considered a repre
sentative vote. It discloses a condition of
the public mind which will be surprising
to those who have not carefully observed
the trend of public opinion since the
announcement of the platform and ticket
put forth at Chicago. Nearly the whole
strength of the American people is in
this campaign on the side of law and or
der, against agitators and the attempt to
excite discontent among the people. The
election of McKiuley^ is therefore as cer
tain as the coming of the 3d of November.

While in Southern California, Miss Susan B.
Anthony was received with great enthusiasm.
The trains were held in order that she might
address the immense crowds that gathered
irom miles around at the railroad stations to
hear her. The rear platform, from which she
spoke, was banked high with the flowers
which were literally showered upon her.
As the train pulled out the crowd cheered
and the women waved their handkerchiefs.
Not a few eyes were dim with tear? as the fig
ure of that noble woman, whose life has been
one continual sacrifice and forgetfulness of
self in order that the womanhood oi America
might be i reed, was borne out of sight, sur
rounded by tokens of love and reverence where
once she received only taunts and jeers. As
the train di-appeared the crowd with one ac
cord murmured, ''God, thess hur."

cries of "Anna Shaw," "Anna Shaw." V\heu
at last she was introduced, Mis* Shaw was
greeted by a perfect s.orin of applause. In a

THE EFFECT OF FREE COINAGE.
Having been asked by my neighbors and
friends IB San Matto find Santa Clara counties
to say what I think of the free silver question
as involved iv the pending election, 1 take the
present mode of doing so. The election is in
my opinion more important than any that has
occurred since the close of the Civil War, and
even if unable to contribute anything addi
tional to a discussion in which so many abler
mon have Darticipated, I may, for that reason,
be pardoned for the attempt.
Historically we know that the coinage act
passed under General Jackson's administration
treated the dollar of 25 8-10 grains of stan
dard gold es the money unit of the .United
States. At that time, as for the fifty preceding
years, the bullion value of silver and gold
stood so very nearly sixteen of the former to
one of the latter that the silver dollar of
412 8-10J grains of fine silver was retained,
and both it and the gold dollar made legal
tender. The silver dollar was, however, worth
as bullion about 2% per cent premium over
the gold one, and consequently when issued
from the mint did not remain in circulation,
but wasTnelted down or exported, and really
went out of use. The gold dollar remained
the standard of commerce from that time
down to January 1, 1862. when specie pay
ments were suspended throughout the United
States, except iv California.
Specie payments remained suspended from
1802 to 1879, during which time the people,
outside oi our own Biate, used neither gold
nor silver as money. There was no coin
whatever in circulation; their currency con
sisted of greenbacks, bank notes, fractional
(caper) currency, and, for part of the time.
postage-stamps and trash popularly called
"shinplasters." go absolute was the banish
ment of coin from the circuia. ion that I re
member an instance wherein an unhappy
Californifui was arrested in Washington City
and looked up over night for offering a penu
ine gold coin in payment for some small pur
chase on the supposit(pn that it roust be coun
terfeit, as no one in his senses would think of
paying go:d out aft money 1
During this Interval of suspended specie
payments Congress took up the coinage laws
for revision, and, after two y? ars of examina
tion and consideration, passed the act of 1873,
wherein the silver dollar was omitted from the
list of coins of the United States. It is said
that this ct of Congress demonetized silver,
and it is railed by the silver fanatics "The
crime o! 1873." It is true in one sense, that it
demonetized silver, out not in the sense
claimed by Mr. Bryan and his supporters. It
did not throw any actual money out of use nor
aff ct the value of a single debt then in ex
is'.ence, for they hart ail been contracted aud
were payable in paper, less valuable than sil
ver, and which was a legal tender. What it
actually effected and must have been intended
to effect was to provide that whenever specie
payments should be resumed it should be in
gold.
Silver had at that time fallen appreciably in
value, in consequence of the great production
of it in Nevada, and the framers of the act
doubtless recognized that it never could main
tain itself at par with gold without a change
in the size of the dollar, which they were not
prepared to make. On the other hand, to look
forward to a resumption of specie payments
without in some way providing for this change
of value would infallibly put us, whenever we
did resume, on a silver basis; lor where two
sorts of money are in circulation, legally
equal to one another but of different bullion
values, the cheaper one is invariably retained
for domestic use and the more valuable ex
ported or melted down as bullion. That is the
universal and unbroken experience of the
who.c world.
Tbis known monetary law and the fact that
the silver dollar had never cut any figure as a
circulating medium undoubtedly determined
the authors of the act to drop it from the list
of coins of the United States. Be this, how
ever, as it may, it was dropped, and the de
termination was thus arrived at that when
ever we did resume payments it should be
distinctly In gold. This decision did not, as
above observed, affect a dollar of existing in
dividual nubilities, for they had all been con
tracted in paper, and actual resumption was
out cf sight, in the distant future.
It did however, come at last. Specie pay
menu were resumed in 1879, and since that
time the word dollar iv this country has al
ways meant a dollar iv gold or its equivalent.
All indebtedness since that time has been
contracted and is now payable in such.
Now. the free-coinage proposition is that
every man who can get $530 worth of silver
may take it to the United States Mint and
have it coined into 1000 silver dollars, with
which he may pay $1000 of debt to any credi
tor. You lend me 1000 gold dollars to-day
and when free coinage passes I may pay you
in silver which 1 bought with very llttie more
than half the sum borrowed and keep $470 of
the casn you leut me as a profit. The oishon
esty of the proposal is obvious ou its face.
That unprincipled debtors and people owning
silver mines should favor such a law I can
understand, for there are plenty of mean
people in the world ready to make money out
of any kind of knavery; but why plain people
who mean to pay their, own debts honestly and
would like other people to do the same should
do so is not c mprenensible.
Much effort has teen made to induce the
farmer- to take up this free silver fad, by hold
ing out to them in a disguised way the
how oi scaling down their debts, by making
Syruore plentiful; and men who would
repel, with indignation, any su^" 10 ? Â°i n a
dishonest bankruptcy are deluded "to listen,
ing to these tempters by such s W >h Â£ .frnwn
suggestion that it is not silver that has grow"
ch.ap, Dut gold that has grown dear, tha
there ib not goid enough in the world to .do the
word's business, that other commodities, have
grown ctieap as fast as silver uas, and that it
is unjust in face of the fall In produce loask
them to pay in full debts which ine>Â«m
traded when produce was dearer. Andto
those who feel thus, it is ailurinely held out
that free-silver coinage will enable twrato
pay their debts in cheap money and at about,
53 ceuts on the dollar.
Ido not know that it is worth while to
reason with such people, for they can harai>
â help seeing that what they aim to do is rea.iy
to repudiate half of their debts; and they of
course will understand that no one wi 1 PUJ
them if in sucii au effort they are themselves
ruined. Yet thati s just what will befali them,
and they will nave the grim satisfaction oi
knowing that it is their own doing, tor Jlr.
Bryan, if elected, will have no power to enact
or permit free-silver coinage. To do that will
require an act oi Congres- which tue present
House of Representatives wlil never pass, and
Xo which the House to be elected this fall will,
beyond all doubt, be equally opposed. Mr.
Bryan's elect. on, however, will constitute s-o
clear a menace ot free silver in the future (so
soon as his party' can secure the House oi
Representatives) that creditors will not wait
for the jubilee oi repudiators and the scÂ«ling
down oi debts, but will call in their demands
at ;nce, while vet the Ihw will onabie them to
collect them in undepreciated money.
Th â¢ election of Mr. Uryau will thus be the
infallible signal fur a general foreclosure of
mrtanges and a financial panic of the most
disastrous kind. Those wno, by their votes,
demand liberty to pay in inferior money what
.they borrowed in gold can scarcely complain
if thefr creditors decline to gra^t them time,
knowing the use to be made of it. They will
be foreclosed remorselessly, and before free
silver Can be made law they will be petition
ers in' insolvency without even the poor satis
faction of being credited for honest intentions
or pitied for misior une.
Thuouly debts that will be scnled down by
Mr. Bryan's election and free silver coinage
will be those of the United States Government,
and they undoubtedly will; but at what a
cost! Every dollar the Government i.ow owes,
except some $60,000,000 of currency sixes,
was contracted lor gold and should honestly
be paid in ;he same. To pay in anything else
would be National repudiation and justly dis
grace us in the eyes of the civilized world; the
bare possibility of it has depressed tin* value
of United States securities once the highest in
the world, to the level of thoso of semi-barbni
ous powers. Egyptian bonds are quoted to-<iay
at 105J4 and United States four.s of 1907 nt
10tt}^. and this merely on the apprehension of
po>>siule free silver.
Is it possible that the vote of California shall
be cast in favor of a result so discreditable? I
for one cannot credit it. Such is not the char
acter we earned forty years ai?o, when we were
lewer in numbers and vastly poorer than we
are to-day. These modern brokers of repudia
tion have perhaps never heard of the fact, but
those of us whose citizenship of California
goes back to the infancy of the State remem
ber it with a pride that the worid has recog
nized as jus"t. San Francisco had less than
50.000 inhabitants: Los Angeles was still a
sleepy little Mexican pueblo: the great valley
of California was unsettled; we had not a mile
of railroad in the State, and raised little more
wheat or barley than sufficed ior our own con
sumption; our only industry was mining and
arts subordinate to it. The Slate officers had
issued a large amount of bonds (several mil
lion dollars), which the Supreme Court
decided to be unconstitutional and void;
tney were- in fact popularly believed to
represent an appreciable amount of legislative
and executive dishonesty and extravagance.
But tne'bonds had the great seal of Caiiiornia
on them ana we all felt the unutterable shame
that would forever rest on ourselves and our
children if that decision wÂ«s permitted to
stand as the last word of California on the
State debt. The Legislature passed au act to
submit to the people a proposition to adopt,
the debt and issue new and vaiid fconds in
place of the old ones dectarert void. The times
were very hard, tke banks had all failed and
commercial aff.iirs were in a state of great de
pression, but th'- resut of the eleciion was not
for a moment doubtful. The Democratic party
was strong in the State, -but it had not then
adopted repudiation as one of its doctrines.
It stood for ho: est dealings .and regarded the
financial honor of the S.ate and Nation us
above all price. â¢ The vote to adopt and pay
the debt was overwhelming and it gave the
State a reputation abroad which made Caii
fornians away from home '-stand a-tiptoe
when their Slate was mentioned and rouse
them at the name" of California.
Ful. owing. this incident came the civil war
and the era of depreciated paper money.
Other States made use of their privilege and!
paid their interest in it â all but the proud old
commonwealth of Massachusetts and the
proud young commonwealth of California.
We migiit have made a deal of money during
the war* and the reconstruction period by
simply doing Â«s others did and paying our
debts in the money of the day. But the Caii
fornians of that day were .made ot sterner
stuff; they had borrowed gold and in gold
alon.- th>'y would phv. I cannot believe that
when the sun goes down on November .3 the
result of our State election will show our
people of 1896 to have degenerated from
those of forty years ago. John T. Doyle.

LADY'S WRAP.
A delightfully comfortable as well as stylish
wrap is evolved. out of the Eton jacket shape
and cape combined, the body of the garment
being fitted, in fact, being an Eton jacket, with
cape sleeves.
There is a dart on either side of the front and
under-arm gore ana a seamless back. Thongh
sleeves are so much' diminished there is till
considerable bulk to tuck away, nndi'iaturally,
as the jacket sleeves have likewise shrunken, a
garment like the one above is much appre
ciated, allowing the dress sleeve plenty of
room.
' A handsome wrap had. the body of velvet
with sleeves of Astrakhan fur.
Another was designed and made by a clever
home-dressmaker of an old-fashioned sealskin
jacket. The body of the garment was of seal
skin, the sleeves being of velvet with several
rows of narrow sealskin set on an inch apart.
PlÂ«in cloth braided is very stylish. The
braiding may be in motifs in an all-over de
sign on body and sleeves, or braiding may ap
pear only on sleeves, body being left plain, or
vice versa.

trip of the first locomotive used in the United
States. It was called the "Stroubridge Lion,"
built in England, and was run by Horatio
Allen on tbe Honesdale and CarOondale Rail
road, built by the Delaware and Hudson Canal
Company In 1829. Its weight â six tonsâ was
found to be too much for the tracks. The
' first locomotive built in the United
I Stales was by Peter Cooper, and was
I experimented with ou the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad on the 28th of August, 1830, over
| fourteen miles of the company's track, which
was Opened for traffic on the 24th of May oi
I that year. It was aiscovered as a result, of
! that experiment that the locomotive could
beat a train drawn by horses.
In. Case of Deathâ E. J. W., City. , II the
majority of Presidential electors chosen on
the3d of next November should be Republi
cans, and on the s:h day of the same month
Wii'iiam McKinley, the Republican nominee
for the office of President, should die. it does
not follow that Mr. Hobart, the candidate for
the Vice-Presidency, would be elected Presi
dent, for at that time there would not have
been an election for either President or Vice-
President, and it is only In the ev<Â»nt of death
or other disqualification of the President to
serve after he has been t> worn in that the Vice-
President cpuld become President. if the
candidate for the Presidency should die at
any tijhe before the electoral college met, tho
electors wouid cftst their ballots for some one
they would select, and he would be the Presi
dent.
No Chance to Voteâ F. N., Oakland, Cal. In
your case the law in regard to registration
works a hardship and causes you to lose your
vote. Tbe law as amended at the last session
of the Legislature provides that registration
shall commence 160 days before a general
election and continue for 75 days, when it
shal: cease. While it is true that a man does
not lose his residence while engaged in navi
garion, he, under the present law, loses his
opportuoitj" to vote if he is not on shore at tha
time that registration is in progress and has
his name placed on the register. This corre
spondent after telline about his Inability to
have, his name placed on the great
reg-ister of Alameda County, says: "It
, seems to m? that when I left "here to
go on a cruise time months ago I was too soon
to be registered, and when 1 returned a few
days since I was too late. According to the
law as it now stands a seaman has no chance
to vote unless he remains idle on shore from
ninny days before election." .

The old stern- whÃel steamer Frank Silva
is to. have her trial 'trip- to-day. Some
month's ago she was an all- round tramp,
carrying wheat, hay and general merchan
drse from point to point in local waters.
I Now she is a gasoline boat, and will carry
I petroleum. from the- George Loomis to
varigUÃ points' on- the 1 bay. Tins is the
first time that gasoline has been applied to
a sterrn-wbeeler in the bay of San Fran
cisco, and probably the first time in the
world. Several week- ago the Frank Silva
was tested, and a small break in. the ma
chinery resulted. \ Now everything is in
working order, and the engines .having
been turned over several times the chances
are that the Silva will make good time oh
â her first run. The accompanying sketch
shows' the stern-wheeler as she -appears
without her smokestack.

There is trouble between Captain Dwyer j
of the British ship Flintshire and

terday to load a general cargo, and was at

The latter is from .Astoria and is loaded
with wheat. Capttin Dwyer refused- to
take any notice ol the order and beetan

another dock, and the troutjle between
the wharfinger and the captain is still un

Wharfinger Root will order the Flintshire

and then "fur" will fly.
The ship Centennial, recently purchased
by the Alaska Packers' Association, is in
a peculiar predicament. She has been
fitted out for a run to the cannerieÂ«, and
was to have sailed ten days ago. All the
sails were bent, the stores were aboard
and the tue alongside, when a telephone
message delayed the Bailing. The insur
ance people demanded 30 per cent for the'
nsk. and the. owners would not nay it.
Durine the winter months the navigation
of Alaskan waters is dangerous, and not- |
ing this fact the -underwriters asKed for
more premium.. A considerable amount
of haggling has been done, but the insur-"
ance people are firm. In consequence the
ciiances are that the Centennial's' sails
will beunbent and she will lay up in Oak

NO CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
Master Bakers Unanimously
Ratify an Anti-Present
Resolution.
The Return of Sta.e Bread and Regu*
lation of Prices Still Under
Consideration. . â 
. The Master Bakers' Protective Associa
tion met yesterday afternoon to consider
the resolution adopted October 17 regard
ing the stopping of- Christmas gilts, regu-
Uaiing the price of loaves .and permitting
no more stale bread lo be returned from
the branch bakeries. About seventy-five '
members were present.
The meeting resulted in the resolution
regarding 'Christmas presents being
unanimously adopted and in a commit- j
i tee of Jour being at pointed to Investigate
the propo-itiun of regulatfng prices and |
stopping tije return oi stale bread.
The meeting was called to order by
President Nicho.as Prost, and George
| Loewen immediately took the floor and '
made an argument against the giving of
Christmas presents. George A. Kutz fol
.lowed, seconding. He said the practice
ate far into the bakers' profiles, while,Miere
was no business on earth in which Tnen
were expected to sell so much ior so
little.
Charles A. Bantel wanted to know how
the weight and price of loaves coiild be
fixed, as some cuuiumers demanded water
bread, which could be sold cheaper than
milk bread. Kutz, in answer, thought
water .loaves might be made larger but
that the price should remain uniform.
The question of ratification of the reso
lution against giving Christmas presents
was then put and carried without a dis
senting vote. The only question in con
nection with the proposition that excited
. m ach discussion was how customers should
be notified.
Some members favored circulars, others
advertising in the daily press. After much
discussion pro and con the matter was left
to the stand. ng committee.
George A. Kutz, J. Lerner, M. F. Wolff
and John Schlicbtmann were appointed a
committee to attend the Italian bakers'
' meeting to be held Nove.mber 2, at which
the same questions as were discussed by
the Master Bakers' Protective Association
will come up.
On the question of the return of stale
bread lrom tue branch bakeries and the
regulation of priced, George A. Rutz, Otto
Falcb, Charles A. Bantel and Charles
Strohmeier were appointed a committee
to take the matter under consideration
and report at the next meeting to be held

CALLS THE PENCIL
DEED A FORGERY
Charles L. Fair's Cross Com-
plaint to Mrs. Craven's
Suit.
J. J. Cooney Accused of Being
Implicated in a Blackmail
ing Plot
HEIRS PRESSING THE FIOHT.
Charges That the Dociment Was
Made After tbe Death of the
Millionaire.
The pencil deeds as well as the pencil will
which James Q. Fair is said to have left in
the custody of Nettie R. Craven have been
pronounced by Fair's children to be for
geries. Charles L. Fair, with his answer
to the $100,000 damage suit filed by Mrs.
Craven because of the refusal ol the Fair
estate to give her possession of the Pine
and Sansome and E:eventh and Mission
streets property, yesterday filed a cross
complaint, in which the allegations of
forgery were made.
After reciting the fact that James O.
Fair owned the property in dispute before
his death and that tbe cross-complainant
is one of tbe heir-at-laws of deceased and
at present a part owner of the premises,
Charles L. Fair, alleges that, the document
recorded on June 19. 1896, at the request
and by the direction of Mrs. Craven,
which paper is claimed to be a deed of gift
from James G. Fair to Nettie R. Craven,
is not a genuine writing ot said James G.
Fair and was not signed, execut-d or
acknowledged by mm. It is furthermore
charged that no acknowledgment of the
paper wa3 ever certified upon it by J. J.
Cooney during the hietime of the million
aire.
The cross-complaint further recites:
That the said document is not genuine and
was and is a lorgery and is false, fraudulent,
forgod and counterfeit, a;id was made, forged
and counterfeited alter tho death of the said
Jhui â  s. U. Fair.
Th t the said certificate of acknowledgment
thereon .was not and is not genuine, and was
and is false, forged and counterfeit, and was
made, forged aud counterfeited and attached
to said document by said J. J. Cooney after the
death of Maid Jam. s G- Fair, and af er the said
J. J. Cooney hurt resigned as and after he had
ceased to be a Notary Pub.ic.
That the said document and deed of gift was
made, uttered and forged Dy the said Nettie
R. Craven and the said purported certificate
'of acknowledgment thereon was made and
forged by said J. J. Cooney at the request of
Nettie R. Craven, and that .-aid document was
tiled for record and caused to be recorded with
the corrupt intent and purpose to cloud the
title of this cross-complainant and Theresa A.
Oelrichs and Virginia Fair, and to injure their
title thereto and to depreciate the market
value thereof, and to compel this cross-com
plainant and them to buy his and their peace
from said Nettie R. Craven and pay her large
sums of money to remove said cloud.
In the answer to the damage suit it is
alleced that Mrs. Craven was never in
possession of the property in question,
and so could not have been damaged by
ejectment.
Wherefore it is prayed that the court
decree that Mrs. Craven take nothing by
her suit ; that the pencil deed be declared

WOMEN WORKING HARD
Two and Three Daily Meetings
Are Held for Woman
Suffrage.
Every Town in the State Will Have
at Least One More Meeting
Before Tuesday.
Every town in the State will have at
least one woman suffrage address between
now and Monday night. There are from
two to three meetings per day on the San
Francisco programme during the remain
der of the campaign season, there being
midday meetings at shops every day.
While all is bustle at the headquarters .of
the various political parlies, there is no
less at the state woman Suffrage head
quarters.
Yesterday two candidates for Judge, one
for Justice of the Peace and several candi
dates for the Assembly called at the
woman suffrage headquarters, and a
stream of ladies passed through the rooms
with little intermission from early to late.
The ladies have demonstrated that they
are strictly up to date by their method of
campaigning. They have sent out num
berless calendars bearing on the top these
words: "Be sure and do not let your bus
band, father, brother, forget to vote for
the sixth amendment to the constitution."
These calendars hang up in so many
houses and the injunction upon them is
supposed to nave been so generally
obeyed that the ladies feel sure that they
will carry the sixth amendment through.
No mau w o enters the rooms is per
mitted to escape until he has put himself
on record as to how he will vote concern
ing woman suffrage. Thousand and tens
of thousands of pamphlets and leaflets
have been sent out. In a word the State
and City have been canvassed orsliy,
verbally, pictorially ami thoroughly.

THE CALIFORNIA MINERS
Their Local Body Selects Its
Delegates to the Con- â¢
vention.
Quartz Mines Will Be Largely Repre
sented at the Next State
Gathering.
When the California Miners' Association
meets in this City in convention Novem
ber 10 it will be the largest and most rep
resentative gathering of mining men ever
assembled on the coast. The increased
interest in the convention this year is due
to the fact that the field of business will
be broader than ever. Heretofore the as
sociation has devoted its time and ener
gies to correcting the bad' features in the
Siate and Federal laws dealing with hy
draulic mining, railroad occupancy of
mineral lands, etc. At the next gathering
the interests of the quartz. miner will oe
considered and steps taken to improve his
condition. This was not overlooked in the
past, but the association had to take up
one feature at a time in order to accom
plish anything. Now that the quariz
mining interests are to be taken in hand,
miners from the hills as well as ihe river
bot.oms will be present and to the full
representation allowed â one delegate to
each ten members of the county associa
tions.
The Miners' Association of the City and
County of San Francisco yesterday held
its regular annual meeting. The member
ship list showed 403 enrolled. Thereiore
the association is entitled to forty dele
gates.
Julian Sonntae suggested that a com
mittee be aDpoinieii to nominate the offi
cers and delegates Secretary Charles Q.

delegates. All these suggestions were
adopted.
The committee appointed by the chair
man ' consisted oi Niles Searls, S. K.
Thornton, Julian Sonntag, Louis Sloss Jr.,
C. W. Cross, L. Reichling and S. W.
Hendy.
A recess was taken in order to give the
committee an opportunity 'to make Its
selections, which are as follows:

MUSIC AND DRAMA
FOR THE PRESS
A Highly Successful En
tertainment at the
Grand.
Distinguished Artists Give Their
Services for the Press
Club.
SHAKESPEAEE - VAtJDEVILLE,
The Tabers in "Much Ado" and Jasper
and Jeikins in a Circus Act
. A Big Audience.
One of the most successful performances
of the kind ever given in this City was the
Press Club's annual entertainment at the
Grand yesterday afternoon. A large and
appreciative audience was in attendance,
which wisely refrained from encoring
even the choicest features of. the pro
gramme more than three times. As the
cream of. talent at the City theaters had
been skimmed for the occasion the audi
ence showed great moderation.
The programme opened almost as the
clocks were striking the hour of 1:30 with
the fourth act of "Tennessee's Pardner,"
from the. Columbia Theater. The man
agement of the Grand had provided ap
propriate mountain scenery and the act
aroused great interest. Charles B. Haw
kins, as the hen-pecked old-timer, at once
became a favorite and Jane Corcoran's
pretty acting as Tennessee was especially
applauded. The rest of the company,
consisting of Harry MainhaH, Oliver H.
Barr, Frank M. Kelly, Walter Ryder,
Frederick Hicks, Leon Parment, Estha
Williams and Annie Mortimer, did good
work. "The Golden Nuggets," a male
quartet, received the full compliment of
encores.
Mr. and Mrs. Taber gave a taste of their
quality in the church scene from "Much
Ado About Nothing," which made the
audience hunger for more. They were
supported by Baesett Roe, Henry Doughty,
Frederic Murphy, H. A. Langdon. Bodson
L. Mitchell, Eugenia Woodword, Alice
Parks and Katberine Wilsonâ some of the
bestmembers of their company â and the
staging and costuming oi the act were all
that one expects lrom these distinguished
artists. â¢ â¢â¢
The "Zanzibar Trio," from the "Babe 3
in the Wood," at the 'fivoli, g^ve promise
of being encored uutil it Was time to open
the.evening performance, but Ferris HaTt
man introduced averse against encores,
wnich had the effect of quelling furtner
demonstrations. He was assisted in the
trio by Elvira Croix Seabrook and Maurice
d'Arcy.
Victory Bateman and Howard.Kyle, as
sisted by Frank Hatch and Nettie Hines,
appeared in the pretty, two-act drama
"Sweethearts." The little work gave the
performers an opportunity of doing some
very artistic acting.
In the concert part of the programme
Bernard Molienhauer played a violin Â»otT>
very acceptably, accompanied by Mrs.
! Willard J. Batcuelder. The' Press Club
quartet sang two lullabies and a second
encore, and R. T omas, one of the
tenors from the Tivoli, won warm, ap
plause for "Tom Bo.wling." Mr. Thomas
sang in place of Frank Lincoln, who was
unable to give his musical entertainment
owing to a previous engagement, Â .
Clayton, Jenkins and Jasper from the
Orpheum gave iheir humorous circus rid
ing act, and Miss Josephine Gassman held
the audience till the curtain went dow*i
wirh her celebrated "Coon" song. Every
thing had gone as smoothly and rapidly as,
! if on oiled wheels,, and it was so early for
an entertainment ot the kind to be ov-er
that tbe audience seemed loath to depart.
Considerable praise is diie to Leo Cooper,
the stage director, assisted by Tom An
drews and Louis A. Imhaus, for- their
'avoidance of all" "waits." â¢ "
Just before Miss Gassman's song Judge
Hebbard made a graceful little speech,
thanking tlie artists who had so kindly
volunteered their services. The Judge
also said some pleasant, things about the
newspaper profession and the press of this
country. . â¢
Beautifully illustrated souvenir pro
grammes were presented. to all comers,
aifd a postscript stated that the Jfress Club
.was indebted' for the programme's literary
features to such well-known writers as Fred
S. Myrtle, C. M. Coe and Pnil B.M ontague.

* *' Discuss the " Free Silver
."â¢ . -* : Question. â¢ .
G The Women's Bryan Free-silver : Club
entertained the voters, of San Francisco
â¢ â with a spirited meeting at the California)
Theater last night. ' About . sixty . ladies j
>. we're seated on the platform. â 
The meeting was called- to order by j
"beorge P. Keeney, who introduced Charles ;
o D. Lane,' the noted gold-miner* of Angels j
Camp, as chairman of the evening.*
. * Mr. Lane said lie was proud to be chosen j
, as chairman of the evening, and he was j
especially gratified to be honored in this :
way by" the ladies, for he has a warm j
'place in his heart the ladies. They are \
the *eal home-makers and- home-keepers j
and he hoped to see, them in a portion to
exercise their rightful share in the J gov
o ernraent of the country, for they .will be
â beyond the reach of ward heelers and !
:j : .ljall9t-boxÂ°stufEers.
Â° Mr. Lane said that he did not pretend to
,* be a speaker, but' he was surprised to see j
c fame ot the orators that have been im
ported o by the Republicans to teach Cali- i
fornians how to vote on the silver ques- !
; tiÂ«n. He had. read, all of* Thomas B.
â  ' Reed's speeches and cou.ld find nothing in |
" oinem that in his judgment would justify
â paying the freight on a man -in a third
â  dass tourist-car, Jet aione sending him j
across the, continent in. a train of* palace'
'coaches. 0
Mr. Lane thought, that California would
o give 50,000 majority for Mr. Bryan. .
o Miss Cushman recited a parody on Marc J
' Antony's oration at the funeral of Ciesar, ;
after which the Trebje Cleft Quartet, com- j
posed of ladies, sans sweetlv'about "The j
' Silver Dollar of the Dads." . " . .
â Thomas V. Cator began to make his j
:â¢ regular campaign speech, predicting 50,
-.. 000 majority for Bryan in California, but
" -was"cinterrup,ted by tne c arrival of Governor
. BuÂ°dd, who had- beeri asKed to speak, and \
â¢ .vrh6 had an cugagenjent to address an- j
other meeting in a different part of the j
Â City. In order to allow him to fill both
~Â° ' engaeements it was necessary for him to
speak at once. ' ".
' Governor Budd told the story of the way j
in which the last Legislature, passed ai
resolution favoring the coinage ot silver
. and compelled, him to telegraph it to I
' Washington City in great haste. Some of j
â those legislators have since" reversed lheir
" position .in regard to "silver.- He appealed
. oto t<fie voters of California , to couhrm the j
official declarations made by the last Leg- i
islature. He a thought they* would do so,
." * and estimated the majority for Bryan at
the G usual figure ot 50,000 as agreed on by
the Democratic State Campaign Com- j
. ljiittee. ' . - *
â â¢ I The Governor dwelt at some length on
the silver question and declared that
. m t|nited 0 States bonds are, by their face, j
* payable in- silver or : gold. He said it
. Would be greatly to the .benefit of the
cfommon people if silver should -be* remon
eiized, yet if the people allow a Republi
can to be seated in the Presidential chair
Â° 'it will be indorsing the proposition that

He was born thirty years ago in Springfield, Mass., and is the son of M. J. Welch, one
of the pioneer miners of this State. As a mere child of 4 young Welch entered the
public schools of Massachusetts and before he was 9 years of age he was graduated
frem the grammar school. It was then that he came to California with his mother
and other members of the family to join the father, who was' already located in this
,CitjE. Tbe boy at once entered the first grade of the grammar school here and was
graduated in the following year, whereupon he entered St. Joseph's College, now
known as the parochial school of St. Joseph's College. At the age of 14 be discon
tinued active school study and began a course of business experience that after seven
teen years has left a noticeable trace upon his character. lie besran as an office-boy in
the railroad service and worked his way up from one position to another as li is fitness
became e\ident to his employers. From ticket agent he was promoted to traveling
passenger agent, then to traveling freight and passenger agent, and finally was made
general Southern California freight and passenger asent of the Gould system of rail
roads. After fifteen years' service with one company he gave up his position two
years ago at the time the company was reorganized. Since then he has been engaged

Soon after his nomination by the regular Republican Convention the Non-Parti
san Convention met and its Senatorial committee sent out notices to all the Senatorial
nominees of other conventions. While others were exerting every effort to be indorsed
by the: committee Welch contented himself ; with standing only on the Republican
ticket and platform and made no attempt to be indorsed by another body. The Sena
torial committee first recommended the indorsement of the Independent i Republican
nominee, but the . convention disapproved and substituted the name of ': M. J. Welch
spontaneously and, without solicitation. How formidable a candidate he is considered
may. be inferred from the recent strong efforts of Catbr, the Populist, to induce Welch's
most active lieutenants to labor in the canvass for the Independent Republican candi

Mr. Cator resumed his speech and ex

I said that the ratio of 10 to 1 was and is

should bear to each other in value the re
lation that they bear to each other in
volume, gauged by wejght in avoirdupoK .
Mr. Cator's peculiar intonation indi
cates that he was formerly an auctioneer,
in which vocation his king power must
I have been of inestimable value. During

Mr. Heed, she had heard, is soon to be
in this City to enlighten tbe people on the

condition of the poor people. Her investi
gations had led her to the conclusion that
I protection can do nothing for the. peotile
i of California. She had paid particular
: attention to the boot and shoe industry
i and fo.unri not more than 6 per cent of the

in California. Despite all the talk about
protection the fact remains that Eastern

There are two classes who are in favor

! The first is the man who has gold to lend,
: and the second is the maji who doesn't

question.
Mexico was declared to be more pro -
-: perous than ever before, and this was due
I to the Silver standard. France, the only
! nation that uses common-sense in finan
\ cial affairs, the lady said, maintains the
i latio of I">J4 to 1, and the French silver'
| coin is good in England or anywhere else,
| because the credit of the French nation is
behind it, and that is all that gives any
circulating medium- it,s value. More than
that, nobody, but a Frenchman can buy a
French bond, which 'is right. Wheil
France decides to issue bonds she doeÂ«n't

SENATOR PEBKINS' ESTIMATE
Protection Has Come to' Be Recognized
as the Needed Thing to Bring
. Relief..
The atmosphere about the Republican
State Central Committee rooms has be
come charged with political ozone.
It is now a question of what the major
ity will be.
Senator Perkins arrived Tuesday from
Humboidt County; Major. Kyle came in
from a tour through Mendocino County.
Both of them say that the change in the
political aspect in those northern districts
from Bryan and free silver to McKinley
and prosperity amounts to nothing short
of a slump." . â 
Senator Perkins says that Hnmboldfi
County .is- good for GOO votes over and
above all for McKinley â perhaps 800.
Major Kyle says .the change of- heart in
Mendocino is the most radical within a
short period of time that Jie has ever wit
nessed. Both men account for it aU .on
the simple grounds that the people have I
begun to think for themselves.
â¢ "Party lines no longer hold up there,"
said Major Kyle Tuesday. It has become
simply a business question with the wool- j
growers and lumber men 'in tUat district. !
They seek a speedy return of prosperity: I
They have discovered that this cry' of .free j
silver is simply a delusion and realize Iftat
protection to thsir industries is the thing
really needed." ' .
â¢ Se'nater Perkins has traveled through
more than- forty counties of the State
since the opening of the campaign. â¢ "If.
the expression of the people amounts
to anything," he said; "the bal
ance of the State will rome to San Fran
cisco with 5000 majority for McKinley."
The change in the within the
last two. months has been 1 - most remarka
[ ble. Two months aco the silver craze was
rampant throughout all the country, dis
tricts; but education' has been, going on, .
tile people have been earnestly studying
the question of the hour, with the result
that protection â  has- come to the" front,
and, through the votes cast next Tuesday,
will Ije demanded by the people at the
hands of their representatives at Wash
ington as soon as if may be' given them.
Why, just think of it, the wool crop of
Humbuldt County irf 1592, prior to Mr.
Bryan's meddling with the revenue laws,
sold for $178,595 62. In 1893. after Mr.
Bryan and tile other free-traders had let
in the wool of the world, it amounted to
just $65,310. This year the price averages
10 the larmef 10 centfe. In 1892 he realized
an average of 22}^ cents per pound, j
Wo*uld it not be a wonder, indeed, if the
wool-grower did not vote for McKinley ?'
The same conditions exactly obtain in S
.the lumber business." .
COUNT TO BE WATCHED.
Special Anti-Corruption Fund-VEx-
â¢ Governor Markham's Success-'
ful Tour In the Mountains.
Ex-Governor Markham, who" made a
memorable tour of the mountain counties.
six years ago when he was a successful
candidate for Governor, has just gone over
the ground whicn he then canvassed, and
arrived in .San Francisco. Speaking- of
his recent" tour at committee headbuarters
last night, Governor Markham said :
"I" spoke at Sonora, Angels, San An
dreas, Jackson, lone, Placerville and Ne
vada .City.- The meetings were really j
larger ana more demonstrative than those !
Of the campaign six years ago. I met hun
dreds- of Democrats who say that they
intend to vote lor McKinley. If one can
form a judgment of the result lrom the i
size and enthusiasm of the meetings I
should say that the Republicans will carry j
the Sta,te by a large majority. There lias
been a great trend toward'McKinley since
the campaign actively opened. This hns
been remarked in all the mining towns."
The Republicans and other sound-money
men are inatcing a eallant fight in Mendo
cino County, shortly after the Chicago
convention the Bryanites shouted that
there would be only one ticket voted in
Mendocino, and that the total vote would
be cast for Bryan. The managers of the
Republican State Central Committee were I
hot disturbed by these wild reports, but
proceeded to rally the Republicans and
contest the ground. A splendid fight is
on with chances in favor of McKinley car
rying the county. In the beginning of the
campaign Mendoci:io was the acknowl
edged stronghold of the Popocrats, but
the wool men rellected that there could be '
no prosperity without protection, iience |
the Bryan i olio wing has greatly dimin- I
isheci.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee is not only determined to bring out
the. McKinley vote in California, but to
have the votes cast for Republican electors
counted for such electors. A special anti
corruption fund has been raised for the
purpose of defraying the expense of
closely watching the count in every pre-.
cinct of San Francisco. The method is
simple, but effective. Tbe observation of
the count will apply, so far as the State
committee watchers are concerned, to Ihe
general ticket for electors, candidates for
Congress and the Legislature. Every at
tempt of an election officer or clerk to
cheat in the count will be instantly re
ported by special messenger or wire to the
Dureau charged with the responsibility of
detecting the fraud. The system which the
committee has adopted renders it impos
sible for fraud to be committed without
instant detection.

Fred Frantz ana J. B. Endert, executors
of the will of Horace Gasquet. have sued
Porter, Schlessinger & Co. fjar $78,481 7G.
Gasquet, who died at St. Mary's Hos

Keeper of Del Is'ortu County. He dealt
wuh Pqrter, Schlessinger & Co., wbo
acted as his bankers and with whom he
always kept a large balance.
Josepn Kahn, a member of the shoe
firm, was a personal friend of Gasquet,
and- the storekeeper visited him at his
home whenever he came to San Fran
cisc^. While Gasquet lay sicK at the
hospital during his last illness Kahn did
what he coula for trim, and in return for
this kindness Gasquet drew a' check on
his bankers for the -balance to his credit
and gave it to Kahn to hold in trust for
his (Kahn's) children, of whom the de
ceased was very fond.
Gasquet's executors made a demand on
Porter, Schlessinger & Co. for the money
they supposed was in their hands, amount

of the circumstances in the case, brought
suit for that amount and $52,321 84

PUGILISTS IN TRAINING.
Champion Jack McAuliffa Is
Rapidly Getting Into
Condition.
Why Tom Sbarkey Cannot Score a
Knockout "â English Clubs Are
After George Greea.
â¢â¢â¢ â¢ .
There will be no dearth of boxing con
tests in this City after the excitement of
election fades away.
The first professional event of note will j
be the Carroll and McAuiiffe ten-round
bout, which will be held under the
auspices of thu St. George's Club. The j
contest will doubtless be held in the Me
chanics' Pavilion, as the managers for the
St. George's Club cannot agree with Young
Mitchell regarding terms for a lease of
the Woodward's pavilion.
It is said that when Mitchell was asked
for a figure he demanded almost double
the price he was paid for the use of the
hnll by the Armory Club, consequently
the St. George's Club will look elsewhere
for a place in which lo "pull off" the
championship lightweight contest.
McAuiiffe is training hard for tbe match
at old Barney Farley's hostelry, and his
numerous friends are confident that the
champion will give a iirsf-class account of
himself when he meets the well-condi
tioned and well-trained lad who surprised
him some.years ago in one of the mo-it
exciting arid interesting fistic battles that
was ever, witnessed by the members of the
old California Club.
Carroll is sanguine of turning the tables
on his old opponent and it can be safety
said that the members of the St. George's
Club will see, on the evening of November
12, an exhibition of clean hitting and stop
ping which they will have good reason to
remember lor many days.
Among the pugilists of 5 the present day
it would be a difficult matter to select a
brace of lighters who are so thoroughly
drilled in the art ot self-defense as the
men who have been matched by the St.
George's Club. . As a preliminary to tho
event of the evening "Spider"' Kelly and
Lon Agnew will box ten rounds, and it
goes without saying that this contest will,
prove very interesting.
On the evening of November 25 George
Green and Danny Needham will spar ten
rounds under the auspices of the National
Club, and it is said that Bob Thompson,
the hard-hitting colored tighter ot Salt
Lake, will meet on this occasion the
winner of the Kelly and Agnew contest in
a ten-round bout, provided that the suc
cestful competitor will be physically in a
condition to go a ten-round race.
Tom Sharkey is determined to be in the
pink of condition when he enters the ring j
to contest in an event which will either I
stamp him as one of the greatest heavy
weight pupilists of the day or a man who
has been singularly successful because of*
his good fortune. Tom ts now stationed
at his training quarters near the Seal
Rock, and if good hard exercisa and bag
punching will win him the match, there
will be no gainsaying the fact that the
sailor will achieve a great victory. But
there is something as important as perfect
condition which the sailor must cultivate,
if he expects to defeat the clever and hard
hitting Cornishman.
Shurkey has a style of fighting which is
peculiarly his own. It puzzles clever
fighters, and the. men who have been
whipped by him contend that his system
of deiense and attack, although decidedly
awkward, is difficult of solution. Lt is
patent, however, that Sharkey cannot ad
minister a knockout blow. Protessional
boxing instructors who have seen the
sailor milling are of the opinion that he
cannot possibly whip Fitz^immons unless
he learns how to throw the weight of his
body with a blow. Sharkey : s friends say,
however, .that he has recently learned
many little tricks which will surprise the
knowin.tr ones when they next see
him in lighting gear.
George Green has received two letters
from England. The Olympic Club nf Bir
mingham offered him a" purse of $3500 and
$250 expenses it he will light Dick liurge
twenty rounds, and the National Club of
London offered him a purse of $2500 and
$250 expenses to fight Burge the same
number of rounds, but Green must de
posit $2500 as a side wacer with the back
ers of Burge. The contestants must weigh
in at 144 pounds at 2 o'clock on the after
noon of the contest.
Green says that of the two clubs he pre
fers the National and if he can "raise" ihe
necessary .backing he will accent the offer.
He will, however, demand $500 expenses
In case he decides upon taking a trip to
England, as he will have a trainer accom
pany him.

fonr months in China, going to the inte
rior. He says' an enormous number of
Bibles are being -distributed In those two
countries; in fact all over the -world.'
They are having their effect, though to
some it might seem slow.' '
Dr. Marshall, in explanation of this, as
an illustration, said: "An unknown man
at an early day visited the Nez Perce In
dians of the Northwest. He had a Bible,
and read from it and prayed. The Indians
asked about it and were told the book
pointed out the way to heaven. Three
Indians afterward came all the way to. St.
Louis to get one of the boots. An account
of it was published in a Pitisbu/g paper.
A young man worKing in a sawmill in
New York read it. He decided to take
his bride' and' go as a missionary to tbe
Indians. His wife did not wish to go
unless another woman would. They per
suaded a man and a woman to go.
"It was Dr. Spauldine and wife and the
young man was Dr, Whitman and his
wife. Dr. Whitman afterward, by a peril
ous midwinter ride, reached Washington
and saved an enormous part of our coun
try from hecoming Britiah territory.
''It is thus that our mission work is
being extended, oftentimes great results
being obtained in what would at first
seem mysterious ways: Last year I trav
eled over 32,000 miles".
"The interest in mission work js in
creasing steadily. We now print and dis
tribute free, paying the postage to distant
parts, a very large amount of religious
matter. It goes everywhere and various
religious organizations are equipped
with it.
"The Young" People's Society of Chris
tian Endeavor is also aidin-g in send
ing out a great deal of excellent printed
matter. It is a great factor in this kind
of work. When I was on a tour of the
Orient ana other countries 1 visited pnrts
of the Himalayas and. other re,mote places.
Everywhere I I was impressed with
the importance of mission- work. The
good from it, I am com incod, is enormous.
No man can properly estimate it."
While the doctor was minister of the St.
Louis church he was made synodical mis
sionary for fhe Synod of Missouri. He
had been fifteen years as pastor in St.
Louis, and occupied the otuer position
ovqfc six years. It was then that he went
nbtwid, and on his return was appointed
to the position he now holde.
Dr. Marshall's tenitory as first secretary
is mainly west of the Alleghenies. Since
his arrival in California he has delivered,
sixteen sermons in various places. He
will now go to Los Angeles and Pasadena.
BENDEL MAKES REPLY.
Correction of Some Statements
Made of the Wine
Trust.
Was Not Formed for the Purpose of
Cutting Down Prices of
the Product.
H. Bendel lias replied to some criti
cisms upon the California^ Winemakers'
Corporation. His answer is in these words :
San Francisco, Oct. 28, 1896.
Dear Sir: Permit me to make a few remarks
in regard to the statements made by my es
teemed friend and fellow wine-grower, Jlr. M.
T. Tarpey, relating to the wine circulars sent
out by the California wine merchants.
In the first place Mr. Tarpey is in error when
he states that the wine merchants formed a
wine trust in order to cut down the price" of
wine. This is certainly a mistake, as Mr.
Tarpev can easily ascertnin by reHding the cor
respondence now on lile in jny office.
In the second place the wirio merchants did
not arbitrarily- fix the price of wine, and in no
case has the wine been sold "below the cost of
production these last two years.
I agree with Mr. Tarpey wnen he says "the
coming election is not a mere political contest
tetween two parties; it is a contest in which
business of all kinds will either be benefited
or suffer disastrously," and ior this reason I
cannot understand how Mr. Tarpey can be in
lavor of the Wilson tariff j<>! against the Mc-
Kinleybill. When the McKinley bill wns in
force the duty on imported wine was 50 cents
per gallon and on imported brandies $2 70 per
gallon, while the internal revenue on Cali
fornia brandy was 90 cents. The Wilson bill
has made the change and reduced the duty on
European wines 20 cents per gallon and on
imported brandy 70 cents per gallon, while it
has increased the internal revenue of our
home product 20 cents per gallon. I cannot
see how this has benefited the grape-erower of
Caliiorni*. Whatever the conditions of affairs
raay have been in former years there is no
Boubt that during the last two years the
profits in the wine business have been equita
bly divided between the producers and the
W i ne peTso,Â»ar,y:certainiy have had â much; ex
perience as any producer during the last le
years, and -while in former years I came in
direct competition with the wine | merchants,
selling my product iin the ! Europeâ¢, Eastern
and loc P al market here,' it was noi . nearly
so profitable as when I sold my products too
of the wine-dealers with whom Mr. TÂ«pj finds
so much lault, although the price at wh eh I
sold my grapes has perhaps been less by $- per
ton than any grower of tjjÂ£ dry. wine districts
has received. But, as I stated above , r the price
is highly satisfactory to us, and for th^flrst
time the com; any in which I am "'entered Â£
.in a position to pay dividends to its Â£hare
* T| d the duty of 30 cents "per gallon should re
main intact and the unlimited coinage of
silver should be enforced and importers of
foreign wines be permitted to par the duty,in
silver, it would naturally reduce - the * duty to
half what it is now, because it certainly is not
the intention of the party who favors the un
limited coinage of silver to exchange silver on
demand for gold, and 11 do â  not ; see what can
prevent it irom reducing, the value .of our
silver dollars to the value of silver bullion, as
is the case in; Mexico, where a dollar, contain
ing more silver i than? our dollar, repress! rns
only one-half the value of an American dollar,
for the ; reason that at ; the i present i time the
coinage of silver is limited to the demand, ana
we can at any time get a $5 go.d piece for, hie
silver dollars, which is not tne case in Mexico.
If now. by the unlimited coinage of silver, the
duty should be reduced to 15 or 10 cents in
California ; the ; wine industry ;, in California
would certainly collapse, as we would not De
able to compete with the purchasers in Eu
rope,; because the crop |in Europe last year
was enormous,' and the price at present in Eu
rope is lower than ever. To keep the wine for
a number of years before it is ready for con
sumption would cost at least o cents per gal
lon; add to this the cost of maturing wines,
the cost of cask (which -is here about - five
times as high as in Europe), the freight from
here to the Eastern market, commission, etc.,
and you will find that wine irom Europe can
be landed in the Eastern market for less cost
than from the Pacific coast. Â, - t
As far as lands and products go, I am afraid
that ' Mr. Tarpey has put the cart â¢ before the
hQ.rise. At present they, are , valued in gold
dollars, 1 but should free silver adopted they
would depreciate to the vame of a silver dol
lar. â --'.. -. '.â .â 'â  --- *â¢ : ' â . â  ' " ' ' r â  -"-..
A great deal has been said about Prince Bis
marck's letter on the silver question, and
there is no doubt about it that he has no ob
jection to the unlimited coinage of silver in
the United States, as it certainly cannot hurt
the silver mines in Freiberg, Germany, where
between 4000 and 5000 people are employed ;
â¢ but he certainly would not advise unlimited
coinage lof silver for Germany, unless all the
great nations would come to ,an understand
ing on this subject. -' ' â¢ :
It is well known that Prince Bismarck js the
greatest protectionist of all the leading Ger
man statesmen, bu,t he is also much in favor
of .trade, as far ias the United States ,is
concerned," keeping foreign products as much
as possible out of his own-country, but keep
ing the factories in Germany going to their
fullest capacity to supply other nations where
free trade exists, and a low tariff .in. other
countries enables the German manufacturer to
compete with the industries of such countries.

GEORGE CROCKER'S TRUST
He Now Receives One-Eighth of
His Father's Immense
Fortune.
Besides an Extra Half Million in
. Railroad Bondsâ Wilt Spend the
/ Winter in New York.
The termination of the Crocker trust
before Judge Daingeffield last Tuesday
makes an important change in the inter
ests of the members of the Crocker family
tqward the fortune left by the late Charles
Crocker. It was eeneraliy supposed at
the. time of the publication of flis will
that the undivided one-eighth of his for
tune whjch would have passed to bis son
George was left' to his widow and two
son?, Charles F. and William H. Crocker.
By the proceedings had in the matter of
the Crocker trust before Judge Dainger
field Tuesday a different state of affairs
from that supposed to exist was disclosed.
The one : eighth interest, while nominally
bequeathed to the widow and two sons,
was in fad; left to them under a secret
trust agreemenf, the conditions of which
having been lulfilled, that interest, to
gether with its entire accumulated income
for more than eight years past, was turned,
over by the trustees to George Crocker by
order of the court T-uesday, besides the
half-million dollars' worth of Sbutbarn
Pacific branch railway bon,ds also held In
trust, the result being that to-day George
Crocker stands vested with, a full interest
in all of the properties of the late Charles
Crocker equally with his brothers, Charles
F. and William H. Crocker. ..
Mr. and Mrs. George Crocker will close
their California-street house shortly and
expect to spend the winter in New York.

V^ hÂ«tÂ«i, a. if./ sCHARTER AGAIN
WAS CENSURED
Father Yorke Attacked the
.. Merchants' Associ
'...-.--' &tion.
He Declared That It Has Been
Controlled "by a Small .
Clique.
ALSO MADE OTHER CHARGES.
One. of. These Was That Catholic
Organizations Have Been Wil
fully Slighted Recently.
Rev. Father Yorke was advertised to
speak at Metropolitan Hall last evening
lor the .benefit <jf the Presentation Con
vent on Powell street' on the subject of
"The Church ahd Poputor 'Education."
' Father Yorke sppk'e, but upon an entirely
â¢ : different subject; His speech was directed
against the pro;posed new charter, the A.
P. A., and wounH up with a signed state
ment, which hef read irom a printed- slip
. and which as given ia lull. Before Father
Yoik'e spoke o t^e pupils of the Presenta
tion Convent .played a piano trio| th,e
Misses Devlin gave a duet and the gradu
ating class of '97 sang "The Land of the
Free." c ' ; â¢â¢
Fattier Ycrke was introduced by -John
M. Burnett, wHo presided. Father Yorke
s,aid -that these were "stirring times, and
therefore he might be excused if he
phau<:ed his subject to "Vital Issues of
the Hour." He then said that at public
meeting and in public prints he had been
held up as an awful example of inconsist
ency within the' past two days, He spoke
on this point for, some time.
Because, a man had, honest opinions and
was not afraid to express them he was
classed among the bosses' henchmen and
pointed out to an admiring multitude as
a,mong the banditti about to plunder the
City,, he sai.d. The highest issue of thÃ
campaign was whether men and women
shalLliaye a right to ex-press their opinions
without suffering penalties in this City of
Saint Francis. " .
He had asked what the Merchants' As
sociation had in" qommon with the A. P.
P. An -answer had. been printed to his
question wJiich -was as coming
from the Citizens' Charter Association.
He would not cavil about names. ;The
Merchants' Association and the Citizens'
Charter . Association appeared to" him to
be co'hnected:" It. would be more honest
lor the penchants' Association to come
forward to do djrty work in Its own name.
The Merchants' Association sent out to
various â¢organizations 'a request to .assist
in haVine-the votes to be cast next Tues
day honestiy counted. ' This request was
sent by circular Council No. lof the A.
' -Â°P.. A. Ihe answer of the Chatter Associa
tion suggested an untruth. The ' Mer
chants' Association has recruiting . ser-'
; . geants, and "they go back a"hd forth aud
get the "beetle-orowed" to do dirty work.
He believed that a clique control's the
. Merchants' Association in the interest of
".the A. P. A. Strange that when the
M rchants' Association sent out notiaes
*o the A. -P. A. la reference to securing ari
honest coiint the Young Men's Institute
was not notified. J The Junior Order of
American Mechanics, wlrich differed only
: from the A. P. A. in the percentage of its
... members' who were naturalized citizens,
â¢ was notified, but tne League of the ; Cross
was Itft.out, despite its very large member
ship. Why did the Merchants' Associa
tion discriminate?
Every one of his eu litors patronized tne
Merchants'. Association when he or she
/. visited* a store of a member of that asso
ciation. It concerned all his hearers to
appertain that the Merchants' Association,
like Caesar's wife, should be above sus
picion. The Merchants' Association could
iirot^afford to be leu by a clique of dark
lantern bigots.
There- vi.etc those who sunport 'the new
charter, which was like a crazy-quilt.
They had been talking and .had dragged
his name into the controversy. He did
not objec o t tobeing drawn inÂ° if he could
have a chance tQ talk back. HI N. .Cle
ment," who spoke at the= charter meeting
Thursday night, probably thought that he.
(Father York o e) had made positively his
lust appearance -la.st Monday night. He
(Yorke) had saved a night to meetjust
such Â°a contingency.
What Mr. Clement had said concerning
an interview- w.it;h him (Yorke) Ws noc
true. There was enough truth in it -to
make double a Jie. If Mr. Ciement had
called on him .( Yorke) it was in his
(Ciemeut's), astral boÂ°dy and he had not
seenÂ° him. If Mr. Clemeht wandered
around as 1 n ghost 'he (Yorke) could not
be.beld responsible for him. Butit-would
not be- possible foc'&fr. Ciement to have an
interview with bim. There were some
people whom no d^uentman could Â«fford
tQ meet and among such was* H. N.
Clement, demeti' had goneinto a lodge"
asd had sv?orn to deprive Catholics- erf a
cnance to earq their living. If he (Yorke)
needed any reason for opposing the new
charter, th"c* fa^ct -that. H. N. Ciement
favored {he. charter.Â°would be sufficient for
him (-YpT&e) to oppose it.
Hudslson and Price and Winthrop, if
they could get out of the custody of the
Sheriff long enough, might make up a
committee =with Oiement as a member to
tell the pepple of San Francisco that they
did not Jtuow enough to govern them
selves.
.He had been concerning
what he toldthe committee of th,e Charter
Association in regard so his position on
the charter." Ha h-ad secured advice from
Kbbert G. Hayneajid had concluded by
reason' of that advice that the charter con
tained discriminative and restrictive
features directed against Catholics and-
Hebrews.' , â¢
The action ofthe Supreme. Court was
uncertain. The ,"court c might dechle that
the â  provisions' Â£oucerning the public
schools were unconstitutional; but the
court was made up of men, and there were
B'wcb things as politics and influence and
interest. This wit's irot a time when nis
hearers couls afford to take anY chances,
for they had enremies wiio worked while
ihey (ais hearers) were asleep. "These
enemies were not fair fighters and would
; ; strike a man wben he was down.
Tbe provisions of the constitution con
cerning sectarianism in public education
were constantly violated at the State Nor
. hr-al School at San Jose, where Catholics
and Hebrews are .compelled to listen to
services to which their consciences did
not' assent. The,., charter meant endless
litigation, a reÂ°gular Pandora's box, and
would break opetiothe City treasury that a
golden showier might fall out upon the
legal fraternity. Â°_ Every parent had a
rigiit to educate his cnlidren according io
bla belief in parochial or private schools
; c wished, o
Father' Yorko ttfen" read the following
\j as'the conclusion of his address:
m Frt ? m the - beginning of this bitter struggle
I we have urged on all of 0 the friends of liberty
'\ to fojget evjerthing.Jor tne success of the cause.
yWe have urged theih ju> "keep themselves aloof
c irt>m ell parties and from all personal entan
glements. We have besought them not to get
> ul Â°^disputes and altercations as to which was
tne better man, but to confine themselves to
thesoie,,question: V^hich is the strongest man?
We have done so In. the hope that the people
wpuld not tie themeelves up to sideshows, and
that the natural course*? events would deslg
nate the strongest candidate on -whom all
could unite irrespective of personal preference
or political belief.
We have, botli in our own proper person and
ti the columns of this paper, aeain and again
declared that we had no preferences. We have
tried to steer an even keel. Whan the cam
paign liar declared that we were in favor of
one candidate or of another, we clearly and
unmistakably defined our position. We would
rather see an A. P. A. in every office in San
Kranci.Â«co, from Mayor down to Poundmastcr,
than lift a finger to dictate a votet
By that declarntion we stand. We have not
one voice in public and another, in private.
We have the right to be cor.Bidered sincere
until we have been proved insincere, and we
feel justly hurt that the frieuds (if any candi
date^'should have considered it necessary to
the success of their cause to castout unworthy
hints about men dressed In clerical garb
s;andiD,i at the ballot-box.
It is our earnest determination not to allow
ourselves to be used by one faction or another.
When auy faction or candidate tries to use us
or the fight we have made or the iaith we pro
fess or the race to which we belong we believe
it to be our solemn duty to protest against such
use witn all our heart and all our strength.
The methods of A. P. A.-ism are damnable,
whether they are employed by Catholic or
Protestant.
Hence we solemnly warn with all the
authority we have earned and with all the
earnestness we can command all_ Catholic or
Irish societies not to permit themselves to be
deluded by little cliques of professional
Catholics and professional Irishmen who have
taken it upon tliemfelves to indorse candi
dates. Our warning is especially directed to
tbe members of the Ancient Order of Hi
bernians, a little sheet which professes to be
their official organ has indorsed. Dimond for
Mayor. A coterie of politicians pretending to
represent the order has done the same.
instructions are being sent to the members
and to members of other societies that this is
the strongest candidate on whom all are to
unite, and our name,'-our fight against the
'charter, our crusade against the A. P. A. are
all being used by men who are Catholics for
place and Irishmen for revenue as the author
ity for such instructions. We declare now
that all this is done without our sanction. No
man ha^ a right to use our name to further
such a scheme. The characterless scoundrels
at the bottom 'of it are the same who, not so
long ago, made revenue bypeddliug our pic
ture from door to door under the plea that it
was foe our finaucial benefit and who now
would make revenue "by peddling our name
in a scheme which we denounce and abhor.
We know that the name of the A. O. H. is
used without tne consent of its members, even
as our name is used against our will. We ap
peal, therefore, from the clique which is engi
neering this proposition to the great .body
of the members. We think we know what is
for their beuefit and we believe thai they' have
confidence la us. We have no personal objects
to gain, no personal ends to serve. We say
unhesitatingly that the professional Irishmen
who are behind this scheme are behind 'H for
boodle and that trj'eir only purpose is to split
the anti-A. V. A. vote wide open and to keep
it split in order that the' bosses may succeed.
On thing we wish to make certain and that
is that our name and our influence shaH not
be used in this nefarious scheme. We .hereby
denounce it with all the strength we possess,
aud we shall continue to denounce it as long
and as often as we shall have the opportunity.
It is just such movements led by such palntpd
shams as have given excuse to the A. P. A. We
hate A. P. A.-ism aftnong Catholics as much as
among non-Catholics, and we believe every
true Catholic hates it likewise. It is only the
professional Catholic and the professional
Irishman who Indulge in such'chicanery,.and
we are determined that their rascality : shall
not redound to tbe dishonor of decent men.
It gives us no pleasure to say these things.
We say them because we believe that we
would be ffilse to our people and to ourselv.es
if we kept silent Our good'name is very dear
to us and we do not intend to allow irto be
made a source of profit to the proprietors of ,
miserable advertising sheets or to the hench
men of bosses. We believe the people who
have been with us in this fight Irom the be
ginning will not suffer this indignity ",tp be
put upon us. For nothing lower, than arufh
and right and justice have, we striven, fearing
neither traitors within nor foes 'without'. We
ask all who think with us thus. to hold up pur
liauds even unto the end.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1896.
REPUBLICANS TO
THE LEGISLATURE
Other Assembly Districts
Heard From by Their
Canvassers.
All Are Assured of Republican
Victory Next Tues
day.
THE OUTLOOK VEEY BRIGHT.
San Francisco Will Return Most of
Its Lawmakers to Sacramento
With McKinley Views. â¢
The views of the Republican nominees
for the Assembly from this City, as pub
lished in yesterday's Call, acted as an im
petus to the other Assemblymen in the
remaining Assembly districts to express
their views upon the political complexion
as they have focused it.
George A. "Wen* worth, the youne attor
ney-at-law who received the regular Re
publican nomination for the Thirty-sev
enth District, said:
"My district extends from Van Ness
avenue to the ocean, taking in all of Hayes
Valley, which is a prosperous settlement.
And after a careful "canvass of the entire
district I am prepared to assert that I. will
be elected, as I find the-peopie all through
the district to be in favor of McKinley and
protection. This, of course, means the
Republican party and myself,' being the
regular nominee of the party, will, as a
matter of course, get their votes."
."The Thirty-oghth Assembly District
is' Republican. Its citizens and residents
are among the best people in the City, and
being, sued wiil vote 1 for me," said Gus
Polilmann. "Not that I -am any better
than any other man, but simply b.ecause-I
have got the correct credentials from the
regular. .Republican party and as a matter
of course am bound to : vote in accordance
with the policy, of that party and be.re
aponsible to that party for rhy official acts.
I will be elected sure and will vote for a
Republican United States Senator,"
"The Thirty-ninth Assembly District, is
known as the banner Republican district
of San Francisco,' ' said Leon E.Jones,
'.'.and," this being so, I feel more than
â¢proud,to be the regular Republican nomi-
HERMAN LEVISON, the Wealthy Jeweler, Who Died at the
Pup. Restaurant. . .
nee for that district. I will be. elected,
tnat is most certain. I know the people
of my district, and they know me to be a
true and lpyal Republican. And when 1
say th-is I say what I can prove to be cor
rect."
"The Fortieth Assembly District can be
scratched off the doubtful column," said
Sip. M. Bettman, the regular Republican
nominee, wlien asked how he stood with
his people.'
"The district which I will have the
honor of representing in Sacramento next
pprine is safe for McKinley, Hobart, the
Republican party and its regular nominee
lor the Assembly and for all the other
municipal officers.
"Just pass on to the next district and
ask them how they feel. The Fortieth is
0. K. for a Republican United States Sen
ator next January."
"Oh, say, ask- me something that I may
have a littie doubt about, just to keep me
thinking awhile. Wi:y, the Forty-first is
just as certain to elect Henry C. Dibble,
the regular Republican nominee for the
Assembly, as that that same Henry C.
Dibble i 3 running. No use ii worryine
about my districtâ it is loyal and true to
the Republican party and will elect me by
a handsome majority."
"The Forty-second is O. K. for a .safe
Republican Assemblyman and that man
will be mysel.f, simply because 1 am tne
Regular Republican nominee.'.' These
were the words spoken by Lorerzo A.
Henry when asked how he atood with the
voters of his district.
"The Forty-third will return me to the
next Assembly just as sure as the sun will
rise on next Tuesday morning," said Fred
Lnndquist, the Regular Republican nomi
nee lor the Assembly Irom that district.
"I have made a very careful canvass of
the people of my district all along the
line from Market street to Broadway,
cross streets and all, and from what I con
cluded to be an honest expression of their
individual opinions I am certain of being
elected to the Assembly from this dis
trict."
"The right is not between men this
year. It is party and principles, and in
asmuch as I represent the Regular Re
publican party there can be but very little
doubt of my election." This is the way
Jo-eph Merani, the Regular Republican
nominee for the Forty-fourth Assembly
District, spoke when asked about his
chanefs for election.
In the Forty-fifth Assembly District,
where Joseph O'Hanlon is the running
mate of Thomas W. Chandler, the regular
nominee of the Republican party for
State Senator, the conjoined opinion of
both was had at the same time.
O'Hanlon said he was sure of â¢being
elected from tne result of his canvass
among the people. He continued: "I
have lived all aiy life in this district as
has Mr.Chandler, and we both are well
known and have every reason to be as-
Bured of our election."
Mr. Chandler apreed with hiÂ« Assembly
man and said: "The people of this dis
trict are. to a man in favor of protection
and better times. They know that from
the "Republican party alone can this be
expected. Hence we will get a sweeping
majority and be elected."
From these various sources it can be
safely. estimated that San Francisco will
be well reoresented in the Republican
lower house of the Legislature next year,
and that a Rjepublicau United States
Senator will ro to Washington lor six
years. j__

HERMAN LEVISON DEAD,
His Life Ended in Apartments
. Over a Stockton- Street
Restaurant.
The Well-Known Jeweler Acquired
Great Wealth and Spent It
Freely.
Herman Levisori, senior proprietor of
llie California Jewelry Company, died in
his apartments, over the Pup restaurant,
Wednesday night. Mr.' Levison had been
in failing health for three years. The im
mediate caireeof death was pneumonia,
which developed last Monday. The pa
tient's condition was not deemed danger
ous until Wednesday- afternoon, when J.
T. Bonestell, a member of the company,
â summoned. Dr. Mayer. An hour later
consulting physicians were called, but the
patient did riot have sufficient vitality to
resist the attack of the disease.
Herman tevison was widely knerwn in
mercantile circles of this country and Eu
rope. He was an open-handed, generous
and broad-gauged man of affairs, who
was liberal in extending credit, to smaller
dealers, and in some instances his couli-
dence and generosity were abused, al
though not to the extent of marring the
success of the colnpany which he di
rected. '
In 1868 Herjnan Levison married Miss
Marcus, sister of George Marcus, who is
now a member of the firm. For many
years Mr. Levison owned a beautiful home
at the corner of Van Ness avenue ana
Bush streer, which he sold to Johnny
Hkae for $65,000. .There the jeweler, whose
income was large, entertained lavishly.
He also maintained a house in Hamburg,
Germany, where his wife and three chil
dren now reside. His daughter, the eldest
child', is" the wife of Mr. Jason, a promi
nent bankor of Hamburg. Two boys, one
aged 20 and the other 1 4,live with their
mother in Hamburg, where Mrs. Levison
has resided much of tue time since 1888.
In 1885 Mr. Levison organized a pearl
tishinn company. He and his associates
obtained from the Mexican Government
an exclusive privilege or concession for
gathering pearls In the gulf of California.
Mr. Levison invested $85,000 in the enter
prise, which dijl not prove as remunera
tive as the company expected.
The firm of Levison Bros, was estab
lished in 1861, aud its business operations
ha,ve since been very extensive and highly
profitable. The estate of Herman Levison
embraces the land and the building at 134
Sutler street, occupied by Nathan Dohr
mann & Co. and Vanderslice. While the
rich jeweler made money rapidly he did
not hnara his wealth. He was fond of
good living and induleed the pleasures
which his wealth could afford. He trav
eled extensively, and whenever he tarried
for any length of time secured pleasant
apartments, and surrounded himself with
the comloriH und luxuries of life.
The surviving members of the Califor
nia Jewelry Company are J. T. Bor.eetell,
William P. Morgan and Gustav Marcus.
Mr. Levison was bora in Germany fifty
seven years ago.
The Armory Club.
The Armory Club, C. Eckert in the chair
and Jerome Bassity as secretary, were ad
dressed last night by Candidates Sander
son, Cook, Low and Wetmore. Among
those indorsed by the ciub were: John
Hunt and Carroll Cook for Superior Court
Judges; Campbell, Low and Treadwell for
Police Court Judges; Barry and Kerrigan
for Justices of the Peace; Treasurer, A C.
Widber; Auditor, William A. Deane;
Survpyor. S. S. Tilfon ; and Aigeltinger
and Lack man lor Supervisors.
W. A. Deane Club.
The William A. Deane Club met last
evening at the Alcazar building in the in
terest of their favorite candidate for Au
ditor. Several speeches were made in Mr.
J>eane's interest and the evening passed
very pleasantly.
MR. TAYLOR IS
GALLOPING AHEAD
Attacks of Bolting Repub
licans Have Given Him
Strength.
Always Faithful to the Tax-
Payers and His Record
Honorable.
DE YOUNG'S IWC-EEGED SWOED
Business Men Will Support Mr. Tay
lor for Mayor Because His
Record Is Straight
Whether or not the proposetl new char
ter shall De adopted, the contest for Mayor
i 9 none the less important. in the eyes .of
the people. With or without the charter
the Mayor will be the most weighty figure
in the City government. "
The question, then, naturally arises,
"Which one of the many candidates in
the field is the most desirable, the most
reliable, the most competent to guide the
hehn of the municipal government for the
ensuing term?"
His.principal competitors for the posi
tion are Messrs. Diniond and Phelan, rep
resenting respectively the Chris BucKley
â¢ Cator'and Sam Rainey wings of the Popu
list and Democratic parties. As side
show dime-museum attractions there are
Martin Keily's man,-Lauraeister, and C.
C. O'Donncll's man, Dr. O'Donnell. Mr.
'Lanmeister is a respectable flour merchant
and has many friends who deeply regret
the fact that he has allowed Mr. Kelly to
Svengalize him into bolting tne Republi
can party. Dr. O'Donnell needs no intro
duction. He has been a standing candi
date for Coroner, Mayor and Governor for
many years, and has a lar^e practice of a
kind mentioned oniy in the advertising
columns. Alter November 3 he will re
ceive a call to doctor the 'Democratic
party, which will be sadly in need of his
peculiar services by that time.
Mr. Taylor has had n.any years' expe
â¢ rience as a Supervisor,' and -in all those
years he has been a friend of the people.
His political reputation is and has' been
without a blemish. When I. M. Kalloch
(whose son shot and killed Charles de
ifoung of Hie' Chronicle) was Mayor of
this City, and was the pet of the anar
chistic element, Mr. Taylor was a member
of the Board of Supervisors, During his
term of oflice General Grant visited this
City, and the community, blushing at the
thought that the ex-President and hero
should be r.eceived by the choice of the
sandlot, virtually deposed the. Mayor and
appointed Air. Taylor to head the delega
tion of citizens appointed, to receive the
general and offer him the freedom of the
City.
John M. Chretien of the Republican
County Committee said yesterday that the
antagonism of that bolting Republican
newspaper, the Chronicle, had done Mr.
Taylor more good than harm, and that
the members of many prominent business
iirmti had told him that the attacks of the
Chronicle had increased the number of
Taylor's supporters, ana had diminished
the number of those who had felt favor
ably disposed toward- William A. Deene'
for Auditor. Tnua it appears that 'politics
is often a two-edued sword that cuts the
hand which wields it.
Mr. Chretien further expressed the belief
that ihe candidates for the mayoralty
would come in in the following order:
Taylor, Dimond, Phelan, O'Donnell and
Laumeister last.
'Ihe Chronicle is abusing Mr. Taylor
because he did iiot appear before the Board
of Kqualization in' bacram,ento, yet the
back riles of that volatile and politically
unreliable sheet show editorials praising
Mr. Taylor for bis action in that matter,
and explaining that he did not attend the
meeting: because Mr. Cheesebiough, the
San Francisco member of the board, had
specially requested- Him not to do so. Tlib
Chronicle on that occasion said that Mr.
Taylor's course was an honorable one and
wus in the best interests ot U"s City and
County.
. Sue! is the disadvantage of possessing a
treacherous memory and of hopping from
one principle to another. Mr. Taylor is
not that kinvl of a man; his record shows
that he has always adhered to principle,
and hence his course, unlilce that of the
Chr6ni.cle. has always been consistent.
He is gaining in strength "every day, for
'he is a safe, souna, conservative business
man, into whose hands may be intrusted
with confidence the affairs, ol this impor
tant municipality.

ADDRESS
â or the â
CITIZENS'
RON-PARTISAN PARTYL
âTO THE
VOTERS OF SM FRANCISCO.
ri The Citizens' Non-Parisan Party was called Into
existence by* a condition of affairs in the City Got*
ernment familiar to all.
This deplorable condition continues in an aggra-
vaied form. ' â  Â° s
: It has therefore nominated in the interest of
good government, and irrespective of party poll-
tics, a ticket which it asks the voters in the City to 1
support. . . â¢ . V ;â¢ â  Â»
The return of the bosses .to the scenes of their
nefarious operations, the failure of justice in deal* Â°
ing with these conspirators, and ~ the open organi-
zation of corruptionists, have compelled the Non- 0
Partisan Party to weed out doubtful or known bad
men, and place before the voters of this city men
who, are believed to'be honest and honorable/ Â°
- . Each candidate indorsed by the - NonÂ°Partlsanl ' c
has signed a pledge, which is on file wltll the Sec-
retary, to conduct the affairs of the city economi- e
cally, honestly, and on business principles, and '
embracing the following obligations: c
Provide for the fullest enjoyment of religious
liberty; " : - ..."
.*â  Pub:jc schools to be liberally supplied and Â«co-
nomically managed: ,; .. - â o : Â° ;
Total tax levy not to exceed $1 on the 8100 on 5
assessed value of â¢$300,000,000.
" One-twelfth' Act rigidly enforced, and no ex- c ;
penses incurred except by authority of the Super-
visors: â¢ . :
* Golden Gate Park to be improved for the benefit
of the people; expense not to exceed cents on the
?10'J. .â ..'â â¢.., ,
Streets and sewers to be improved, superintend*
cn t to be a civil _ engineer, and business methods o
employed; .'. .'', "
- Eight hours a day's work ; home labor and ma- 'r ;
terial to be preferred In all cases ;__" o
' â Couuty Clerk's olllca to be run within $6000 per :*â 
month:
City and County Surveyor's fees, cost of janitor Â°
service at City Hall, and 'shorthand reporting, to -
â¢be reduced; â¢ â  â â¢? o
. All departments of City Government to be re-
moved from partisan politics; ; c Â«. '
Free rise of Telephone by City: no franchise or , o
extensions granted without direct "benefit to City.
It is the purpose of the Citizens' on- Partisan
Party to see, las far as in its power, thÂ»t such can-' o
didates, it elected, shall carry out their pledge to
the if tier. s '.":" i
. Every citizen recognizes the demoralized condi- c (
tion of our Municipal Government, and. will admit -.
that constant watchfulness is necessary to stamp' â 
out existing abuses and prevent the growth of
others. * * ' ' ,
Good officers need their arms strengthened' â 
against . schemers and temptation, and faithful
officers are entitled to support; while those -who '
'fall in their duty, or yield to the debasing influ- fi
ence of the bosses, or to the direct or indirect
bribes of corporations, should be made to feel the .;.
strong arm of the law.
The Citizens' Kon-Partlzan Party's aim Is to se- '
cure to the City of San Francisco a good govern- ; J . :
ment, and for this . purpose it* organization will
continue until its aim is accomplished. '
;| it is therefore justified in asking the effective 'â 
I 'and earnest support" of all citizens or San Fran- _,
cisco, irrespective of party politics, in its efforts to Â°*
secure at the.coming elect lon good officers for the ,
City of San Francisco. \ =

tributed to the preparations for the payment of

â¢ of the loan market compelled brokers to call for
additional' margins. In a number or instances
holders were either indisposed or unable to re

Considering the exorbitant rates demanded.' for
. Â°'ral loans, the foreign selling and the evening up of
accounts, by bears, who desire to get over the

prices except in fare instances was unimportant.

.â¢CHICAGO; m.. Oct. 29.-The â¢â¢shorts", in
â¢wheat received a twist this morning and a greater,
one than they believed could be given. â¢ Within 10
'minutes after the bell tapped for the opening 2c
ere added to prices as quoted at the close yester
day. The secret rof^the boom lay in the promi
nence-given European orders. The. amount bought
on these orders was' not- livrge, but it had an effect
on the sentiment, which prompted! buy by local
operators."- Liverpool opening ca|)'.es were l^d
higher, which advance scarcely compensated for
the rise which took place here -yesterday. .The
No-thwe%t movement continues heavy, 1121 car's
atiiving this morning, acalnst 109t> last week and
1 136 a year ago. Chicago received 173 cars and
inspected out 94,607 bushels. The Cincinnati.
1 rice Current gave an encouraging view, of the
situation. The si firmest market at New â  ork
caused a sharp break in prices about the middle of
the session, subsquent to which a'neryous unset

OF DR. BROWN
Action of the Bay Confer
ence in the Famous
Scandal,
;he Matter Left in Charge of a
Committee Given Full
â¢ Power.
A BREACH OF FELLOWSHIP.
Pointed Reso'utions Against' the Du
buque Conference for Admit; in_
an Outcast.
. Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
9jB Broadway, Oct. _9. f
.;â  ' The Bay Conference has practically
' ended o its connection with the Brown
Â° O.verman matter and has transferred it to
: . a*Â° committee. The action taken to-day
â .â  leaves all further adjudication of the
trouble between an ei-parte council and
the,l)ubuque association, and leaves the
path perfectly clear for the acceptance into
tie Bay Conference. of Dr. C. O. Brown's
'â  successor at .the regular December session.
':Â«,. Resolutions were passed after a lively
V debate catling on the Dubuque association
; - to recede from its position in the case of
Rev. Dr. Brown, and threatening in case
it refused to *do so to call an ex-parte
Â° council to pass on the lamous case. *
â  "The meeting was opened by the reading
Vof the following prepared by Rev. F. H.
' Foster, the Rev. William C. Pond, D.D.,
arid the Rev. W. W. Scudder Jr., at whose
â  request the meeting Was called:
â¢ â Although we have not been officially in
â¢â¢; formed oi the fact, we are credibly assured
"â  that the Dubuque Association of Congrega
tional Ministers and Churches have received
-â¢ to Its membership and .thus attempted to re
' store to good standing as a minister, Rev. C. O.
'. Brown, D.D., who nas been suspended from
' â¢ membership with us. : It has seemed to us that
c JB'erious questions were thus raised deeply con-'
' .cerning the fellowship of our churches, and
''. 'positively striking at vital points in our policy.
'.â¢" It has also seemed to us hat the d.scussion of
â¢ these questions at our regular, meeting iD De-.
â¢. cemDer * might encroach upon the time set'
â apart for spiritual quickening, so as to mar
creatlv the best efforts of that meeting. The
â¢ .- questions to .which we refer are these: (1) tan
, â  a member of one association or conference be
â  received to another in -any other way than by
â¢ â orderly ttanster, without breach of fellowship?
. o (-) If tnis hÂ«s been done, and thus fellowship
Â° has been broken, what action ought this eon
lereuce to make in the matter?"
â¢ .The following letter from Rev. C. 0.
" Brown, dated Strawberry Point, lowa,
.'â¢ "September 26, 1896, was read:
Rev. George B? Hatch, Registrar of Bay Con~
Terenceâ Deap. Sir: The kindly and Christian
action ot Dubuque Association at its spring
â Â° 0 meeting was this day reaffirmed, proffering me
Â° o fellowship, makes it unnecessary for me
longer to contend for my rights, which, with
;o. out even the form of justice, were trampled
â¢ upon by Bay Conference last April. I should
â . have no expectation that those who broke
Â° ' their plighted faith by breaking their consti
\ tution would listen to any appeal to right the
'â â wrong. I therefore withdraw from the con
â¢ ference. Yours truly, Charles O. Bkowx.
"â¢a " The moderator read from toe Congrega
Â° "tionalist a report of the proceedings of
'theDubuque association in .the. Brown
. case, which showed that it created quite a
â  commotion and -..that the vote stood 21 to
17; the. â¢chair having finally refused to re
â¢ 'cognize an appeal from its ruling. It
. showed that the church having the largest
-,'â  representation in the association was
â¢' headed by Dr. Brown's son.
The Rev. F. H. Foster presented" a set of
' resolutions regarding the action taken â¢ by
, the Dtibuaue association, declaring it a
â breach of fellowship and declaring such
â¢ action null and void. The matter was dis
â¢ ' cussed for several hours on all sides, and
' " several amendments were made to the
wording of the resolutions.
Â°. The following was finally adopted as
setting forth tke' position of the church
" association and its members on the ques
tion of , jurisdiction in such cases: . ,
.. â VV_2e_as. The Dubuque Association of Con
gregational Churches. and Ministers has es
â¢ o Bayed to receive to its membership in good
'standing a member of thispoaference while
. under suspension and without letters of trans
-0 fer} thereiore. â¢ , â¢>,
Resolved, That the personal standing of the
â¢ member affected is no longer the chief matter
'â  ot interest,, being eclipsed by the larger and
more general question of fellowship raised by
this action.
Resolved, That this ; conference recognize the
â¢ following principles 'as embodying its concep
â¢ tion of the case: " - l
' 1. Every local conference or association, like
every , local church, is wholly independent in
' the management of its own affairs.
k " _. The determination of the standing of its
members is lodged in â " the local conference or
- association.
o 3. Every co-ordinate body within the Con
gregational fellowship is bound by the prin
ciples of Congregationalism to respect their,
...right thus lodged in the local conference or
Â° association. . f .
â¢4. In case of the alleged injustice, the
remedy lies in appeal to an ecclesiastical coun
cil and in that alone.
-â¢ * 5. To receive a member from such conference
. or association into another in any way except
by orderly., transfer from said conference or
association, or upon the finding of an ecclesi- i
. astical council, is to commit a breach of fellow- I
ship.. â¢ .......
. ' Resolved, Therefore, that the action of the j
"' liubuque association in the premises is null
, â¢ and void, and that the standing of the mdi- I
vidual in question remains unaffected by the !
. said action. ,- .- â¢
'.Â« These % are to be forwarded to the Dv- j
bnqae council, with the ' following expla- j
. nation: Â« tl , â â  ; Â-,
\ .. Resolved, That we request the Dubuque asso- !
ciation to consider this preambled resolution |
â  at its earliest convenience in a fraternal spirit !
"the spirit in which it is adopted, and to take i
such action in the matter as will conserve the
Interests of denominational fellowship.
The following was also adopted as a pre
â¢. cautionary measure to avoid calling the
â¢conference together again in case the Du
buque association refused to comply with
their requests: â¢ -, â¢
: . Resolved, That a committee be appointed
' a&id be given full power, in-case the Dubuque
0 association does not see its way to take: the
>Â° desired actiou, subsequently to request a
mutual council and to present the case of the
conference, and, if finally necessaryâ and God
Â° forbidâ to call an. ex pane council.
c The committee "Â»a.med to carry out the
plans of this resolu ion consists' of the
moderator, the Rev. J. A. Cruzan; the
registrar, the Rev. George B. Hatch; the
scribe, 8. W. Condon; the Rev. W. W.
.." Bcudder and the Rev. George Mooar, D.D.

.' = .* Smith's Argument. V .'
â¢â¢ O/ ,. OAK L Cal., Oct. 29.â 1n the joint
discussion of the financial question Mon
day evening R. B. Smith, as an argument
againsj protection, cited a bill introduced
by Loutelle of_ Maine 10 allow a town In
Maine that had'been burned the privilege
to import lumber from Canada duty free
to rebuild, and declared that this showed
freo trade would elp us.
K. M. Hayden says the town referred to
is Eastport,, separated from Canada by a
Smail,.narro\v rivÂ«r. which has on its oppos
ite DHnk large lumberyards where, in their
great immediate need, they rpuld secure
lumber to rehouse the p"eople, instead of
sending off some distance for it and wait
ing until it could be shipped to them.
Want Annexation.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 29.â The direc
tors of the Jfixchange have
!>iace 1 themselves on record a- opp sed to
1 c incorporation of a new municipality
at Emeryville, but want the territory an
nexeil to Oakland by the following reso
lutions:
Whereas, The California Jockey Club hns
located its iruot in the immmtiaie vicinity of
our ci;y auti spent almost a qunrter of a mil
lion dollars In improvements; and whereas,
feaing that the Supervisors may revoke the
license that they have grunted the club to
conduct races, and inasmuch as sieps have
already been taken to incorporate the neigh
borhood of the racetrack into a town corpora
tion to protect the club apaiiust such action;
therefore be it
Jfesolved, That we commend the business en
terprise ot tn a Jockey club and express our
dlsapprovr.i ot the incorporation scheme, be
lieving that the district should be annexed to
(JakUind; and further be.it
Jiaolred, That we believe that there are
enough liberai-minded men in this city to
guaruntee_ the granting of a license to the
Jockey Club as long as it does a reputable
business.
Hotel Thief Arraigned.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 29.â Thomas Cos
tig&Q, the aliened hotel thief who has
civen so much trouble to rooming-house
proprietors lately, was positively identi
fied to-day by Mrs. Ahce Welis of the

A FRATERNITY TROUBLE.
Alumni of the Stanford Chapter
of Phi Gamma Delta
Abiicate.
They Ask the National Society to
Expel Them With the Active
Chapter.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 29.â The Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity was thrust into
prominence again to-day. Information
was rpceived from Stanford University
that the alumni of that chapter, which
abdicated from the National fraternity a
few weeks ago, have taken up the cause of
the dissenters ami asked the Nat.onal
Chapter, now in session, that they be also
expelled from the order. This action on
the part of the ahintnl of the Stanford
Chapter iB looked upon in college circles
as a direct thrust at the Berkeley Chapter,
because the latter took issue against the
Stanford men in the beginning and asked
that they be expelled because of- alleged
disloyalty. The alumni of the chapter at
Pale Alto, because of tboir move in sup
port of the active chapter, were the sub
jects of much criticism to-day- by members
of the otlier college fraternities in Berke
â¢ ley because of their disposition to disre
gard the fraternity as a wbo.'e for the sake
of the single chapter at Stanford.
The meniDers ol the order at Berkeley
when seen to-day refused to make any
statement regarding the action of the
Stanford alumni. They took the aggres
; ~i\e in tne fight, and liavine carriei their
â  jr.ii.it they are now assuming a dignified
j position and consequently reluse to talk
| ;urtlier regarding the affair, unless an es
j pre?s.on of opinion is aemandea by some
I overt act on the Dart of the Palo Alto
! men.
Just as soon as the active chapter at
Stanford has been expelled the members
' wil. be free to join another similar order,
but the alumni who go out with them
I will according to the customs of "frats"
be ostracized forever from such organiza
tions.
It is understood that the Stanford chap
ter exyects to receive a charter from the
j Phi kappa Psi fraternity immediately
! upon being expelled from the Phi Gamma
Delta.
Funeral ot Rev. Mr. Hill.'
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 29.â One of the
laigest .unerals ever held in Berkeley tons
place to-day when the remains ol Rev. W.
F. Hill, tne octogenarian, were laid to

THE SAN . FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1896.
ONE SENTIMENT
IN THE COUNTY
Every City and Town Do
ing Good Work for the
Parade.
Stupid Attempt to Create a
False Impression of the
Programme.
MANY PRETTY FLOATS DLVISED
Prpccrats Fear the Effect of Such an
Outpouring of Republicanism and
Are Disturbed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Oct. 29. f
The Republicans and honest-money men
of Alameda County are highly indignant
at the gross and false misrepresentations
persistently being made in a morning
paper regarding the meeting and parade
on "Tom Reed day." The facts obtained
from the committee in good faith have
been twisted, tangled and distorted to a
ridiculous extent and evidently for no
other purpose than to intentionally mis
lead.
An attempt has been made to make it
appear that the meeting at which Mr.
Reed was to speak should have been held
on Monday evening and that it was side
tracked to the afternoon >v the suggestion
of a railroad official who is credited with
having a grievance against this city. '
It is also stated that the sudden change
left Oakland Republicans in a dilemma,
one half thinking that the parade has
been transferred to Monday afternoon and
the other. half thinking that it had been
postponed altogether.
Another statement to the effect that the
demonstration was taken out of the hands
of the Republican State Central Commit
tee is emphatically denied.
Such are the campaign fabrications.
The facts are these:
As soon as it was known that the Expo
sition building could not hold one-third
of the people who would flock into Oak
land to hear the man from Maine, it was'
decided to hold the' meeting at the race
track, and as it would be impossible to ar
range with comfort the tremendous meet
ing at the track at night, it was at once
decided to hold the meeting in the after
noon, if possab c. The executive commit
tee of the Alameda County Republican
Central Committe went to San Francisco
and urged the State Central Committee to
arrange for an.afternoon meeting. It was
considered somewhat of a concession to
nave Mr. Reed speak in the afternoon, but
od the showing of the Alameda County |
people it was granted.
There hap never been an idea or even a
suggestion to have a day parade in this
city. It was the unanimous opinion of
the County Central Committee and all the
bodies who are arranging for the parade '
that it should take place in the evening, |
and the statement tnat the parade com- j
mittee are in conflict with the County
Committee is as false as the rest of the
"information" that has appeared in the
Popocrat press in this connection.
One of the crowning ieatures of the
demonstration will be the number of men
in line who, till a few months ago and .or
the whole of their lives prior to that time,
were ardent Democrats. This unanswera-
ble evidence ot the great defections from
t c Democratic ranks in this county is I
the most poignant thorn in the flesh of
those who are sacrificing truth to a desire
to gratify i>rivate trrievances. â 
On account of the great length and nu
merous features of the parade it would be
absolutely impossible to have held any
meeting the same evening. It will proba
b'y occupy the best p&rt of two hours in
passing a given point, and with the time
necessary to form and get into motion the
whole night wiil be taken up. A score
oi floats are already in course of prepara
lion, and in addition to about fifty clobs
from, Alameda County, with bands and
fireworks paraphernalia, a large contin
gent has promjsed to come over from Ban
Fiancisco. Under these circumstances it
can be seen at a glance that it would haVe,
been the veriest nonsense to try to do jus
tice to the Reed meeting and the demon
stration in one evening. '. â¢ â 
The campaign eadquarters was the
busiest section of Oakland to-day, ana it
U the candid opinion of Democrats and
Republicans alike that never has so much
enthusiasm prevailed as is shown over
next Monday's parade.
Some of the transparencies will have
the following mottoes:
"N^o coercion influences us."
"We resent the insult "of coercion."
"Up goes Bryan with the rise ol wheat,
but suver continues to tumble." â¢
Major E. A. Sherman wrote to Irving
M. Scott to-day a t nd proposed that the old.
Spanish-Caiitornia war cry, "Oro in paz;
en guerra fierro" (Gold in peace; in war
iron) be used prominently in the parades
On both sdes ot the bay as being peculi
arly appropriate for this campaign.
The Bar Association of Alameda County
issued the lollowing notice to-day: ' ' â¢

A meeting of the merchants, employes

of the pageant. Of taese there will be
many. Those so far promised fere F. M.
Smith, a borax display; G. W. McNear, a
ioa l of wheat.
The Remillards will turn out ten teams
bearing transparencies, and men at work.
The Republican leaders of Alameda
County will have a float, and the Army
and Navy League promises three.
The . EFoadway merchants will also be
in line with some symbolic display, and
the cotton mills have promised an exhibit.
Probably the most unique and suggest
ive float will be that ot the jute mills.
These have been clOEed the larger part of
this administration, and the black wagon,
draped with crape, will bear the letterine:
"Killed ior the want of confidence and
protection. Resurrection March 4."

His Wife, Aged, Helpless and

WEALTH AND fcQUALOB ALLIED
Joseph Besse, the Husband, Says He
Does the B st He Can Under
the Circumstances.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 29. j
A most remarkable case of depravity
was reported to the Sheriff's office to-day,
and after an investigation the affair was
no less mysterious,
Joseph Octav Besse, a capitalist and
real estate dealer, lives at 2047 Linden
street. At first the' general opinion was
that the old capitalist resi.ded there
alone, but after a time it "began to be
whispered about that some one was im
prisoned in tne house, and that wLioeyer
it was occupied the room the windows of
which were heavily barred. This story
was told to Sneriff White, and he re
quested Mrs. Prescott of the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children Society to make an
investigation.
This aiternoon Mrs. Prescott made a
visit to the house, and while looking ior a
means to gain admittance Besse appeared.
He at first refused to allow any search
or to say anything, but when told that
t c lady possessed the authority of a
Deputy "Sheriff he consented to admit ber.
The house is a good one, and the fur
nishing indicated tnat ihere was no lack of
funds in fitting it up. The old capitalist
seemed to have a eood idea ol comfort,
and the only room that looked cheerless
and untidy was the one poorly lighted by
the latticed window. In this room an old
woman was lying in the bed. btie was a
mere skeleton, and Besse said she was
stone blind.
Be-se is a French Canadian who owns
properly in Oakland and is rated as a
capitalist. He is 76 years of age. His
property is mortgaged for $1500. He trans
acts his real-estate business, when any is
done, at his home, which he ca^ls his office
juid retjidenqe.
The woman on the bed is his wife. She
is 84 years old and has not been off the bed
for over a year. She is entirely helpless
and Besse locks up the house whenever he
goes out. . â¢
Mrs. Prescott sajrs the bed and the whole
room is in a horrible condition. The
woman was poorly clothed and there were
not more than half enough bedclothes to
produce comfort.
Whether Besse .be a miser or a broken
capitalist, or whether his mind be totter
ing, .are qu stions that the Sheriff would
like to solve, but as the case does not come
within the jurisdiction of his office or the
Children's Society neither can act.

â¢
Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 29. j
The teachers were present at the' High
School at an early hour to-day for their
second day's wort. They were divided in ,
three sections in. order to get those teach
ing children of one age together.
Mr. Garin, teacher of drawing in the
Oakland* High School, spoke upon "Draw
ins Self-tanght."
Miss M.W. Tyrrell presented the matter
of elementary science. She thought that
natural science taugnt the child to get in
formation from bia own researches and
ha<l a refining influence upon him.
H. W. Lynch presented reading to the
teacners. He said: "There are a nuni-
Der of mechanical processes to be mastered
to a certain extent before a child can
really enter into the business of reading."
Professor Elmer E. Brown of the Uni
versity of California spoke upon "The
Ideals of the Tompkins Observation
School." "The matter of heaitli is one
of our special subjects of investigation,"
he said, "and in thi* we have been assisted
by the local physicians. One of the first
thinirs was that of poor hearing of the
students. Then the lung capacity was
found deficient. A good teacher can edu
cate a pupil in the time lost by a poor
one. Time is lost whan it is snent upon
poor . literature if we could give them
better."
S. P. Meuds entertained the High School
teachers with the subject, "What Corela
tion ol Sturii's Is Desirable and Practica
ble in the Hisrh Schools." The address
wa? followed by an open parliament, led
by Professor John Gamble of Haywards.

The mass-meeting of sportsmen which
was held last evening in Albion Hall in

resentative of the feeling of the hunters
of this City toward the preserve system.
Long before the president of the Sports
men's Protective Association, W. J.
Ahem, called the convention to order,
standing room only was obtainable.
The object of the meeting was to call
the attention of the leg a alive candidates,
many of whom were present, to the re
cently inaugurated system of marsh land
preserves, and to ask their support .in a
tight that will be instituted by the asso
ciation at the coming session of the Legis

dent A Lern said that Mr. Dwyer fought
against a bill that was introduced at a
meeting of the Legislature two years ago
wiiich was in the interest ot the associa
tion and that if elected he had every
reaspn to believe the candidate from the
Nineteenth Senatorial District would
knife the association even deeper than
before. He hoped that the members of
the association would not forget Mr.
Dwyer on election day.
President Ahem, in his addres3 to the
sportsmen and candidates present, stated
at leneth the objects of the association.
He said that its aim was to combat the
marshland preserve system; to protect the
farmers' rights and the protection and
propagation of desirable game and fish-
George Dennis ot'Alameda also spoke at
length on the marshland pres-rve system.
He said that this Government wasdepend
ent in a great measure on its citizens to
fight the battles of the country in case of
war, and that the young men of the
present day who were not born with silver
spoons in their mouth should be accorded,
at least spme territory wherfl they could
learn how to bandie a shotgun and a rifle
in a manner that would prove cf service to
the country if they were called upon to

Mr. Schmidt, one of tde attorneys for

" SACEAMENT ANS IN HARD LUCK
F.eur cb Lis, With Duffy Up, Nosed \
Â°Â°* "... Out by Mid:ight,_ Ridden by .
Jones.
* : The talent went out to Ingleside track
." yesterday to make five passes and put j
'.. thirteen bookmakers out of business. . Tho
â¢ Â° ''tones" did not roll right and every one |
â¢ of these thirteen bookies will be sawing j
*Â° " wood at the same old stand -to-day. Babe ;
Murphy, a 7 to 10 shot, first split the com-- j
binations, and then Torsina, a 1 to 5 ,
' chance, failed to weather the gale. . Fieur
Â° de Lis in the two-year-old event liehtened i
â¢â¢ the pockets of the Sacramento contingent j
â¢'.Â° and the hard luck ceased, the favorites \
i taking the remaining two events. It was j
: simply another illustration of the uncer- !
Â° tainties of racing. â --'/ :
The card was not a "Derby day" one by !
= " Â° = any means, but the attendance was good.
'.'= The track had dried out nicely, being in
; = very fair condition.
' ;--Â° Although a saw-horse might be rigged j
' â¢ up in somebody's backyard, astride which !
Jockey JMcHugh could receive riding les
â¢"- sons, that industrious youth prefers prac
.'...' tice in a real race, and the crowd was â¢
"': again, asked to contribute to his education
'â¢ in the opening seven-furlong run and ac- i
â¢ = Â°" ceded. It is getting expensive, but with
Spartan-like fortitude, race-goeis live with
a hope that he may yet become a Garrison.
â¢"' He had the leg upon the 7to 10 favorite j
Babe Murphy, snowed that he car. wait, |
and was beaten out a length or so by
Bueno, also quite extensively backed at ;
9 to 5. eSfSip
Bookmaker George Kobe's Torsina I
\ looked liKe emeralds from Ireland in the f
;. Â° six and a half furlong spin for three-year- j
' olds, and was held at the prohibitive odds !
of Ito 5. Showing speed at intervals, she !
. ', fagged out badly in the stretch, ending up
â '= third.. Reddington, a7to 1 shot, witÂ» 107
pounds in the saddle, ran like a real good
one, winning very cleverly , by a couple of j
lengths in 1:2-1*4, St. Aignon coming fast !
at the end, beating the favorite out for j
â¢ place.
"â  \ Chapter three was the one that furnished
occasion for Eddy Jones to distinguish
â â¢' himself. He had the mount on Green |
,:â¢â¢â¢ Morris 1 filly Mid light, aiU after leading
-.. from the jump-i.ff to within a furlong from
â¢ the wire was challenged by the 7to 10 '
choice, Hear deLis, ridden by 'â¢Montana"
â¢ Duffy. The pair indulged in a rare nose |
â¢ and nS?e finish to the stand, Midlight j
'â¢-. finally getting the decision by an inch or j
'â . . bo. The winner was as good as 3to 1 in I
. '-.. the ring. Â â¢ "
â¢ â¢;â ' A 3O io 1 shot, Favory, backed down to i
. â 15, came very close to downing the 3 to 5
; " favorite, Little Cripple, in the mile selling
, event. .""â¢/â¢ -
â¢â¢ Â° The outsider cut out the running, show-
"Â° ing two lengths in front of the first choice j
â¢ â¢ rounding the bend for .home, and, it was j
/ 'only by hard riding that Jones r got j
â " .â¢Humphrey's, brown i; gelding past the j
â¢â¢ judges a neck in advance of the outsider. I
' Hermanita finished in the show.
â¢ . The last race, a six- furlong sprint, went
'to the 6 to 5 choice Alvarado. Montcom- â 
V- cry and Circe raced their /heads off the â 
first three-quarters o f the journey, when !
â¢ the favorite, assumed the lead, winning in
driving finish from Daylfgbt, which .latter
colt ran a very clever race. ,
"*. Notes. ~ r ' . r< â . '
Â». ...The judges concluded at the finish of
1 ' the mile run that Si McClain, who rode
Meadow Lark, was capable of cutting
more ginger into his riding, and restricted
him to accepting mounts from his em

HOW MRS. HUNT DIED
Mrs. Wegener lÂ» Formally Chareed
With Having Performed a
Criminal Operation.
,Mr<\ Wegener, 419 Eddy slreet, was de
tained at the Central station yesterday on
a charge of having performed an opera
tion on Mrs. George K. Hunt, which
iinally resulted in that lady's death. Mrs.
Hunt passed away at her residence, 511
Turk street, October 23. Just prior to her
death she told Dr. fitone that her illness
was due to an operation performed by
Mrs. Wegener.
At an inquest held yesterday the jury
returned a verdict that Mrs. Hunt had
come to her death as the result of an
operation pen'ormed by parties -unknown.
This was not in accordance with the evi
dence presented as viewed hy Coroner
Hawkins and he immediately ordered
MrÂ«. We.gener placed under arrest.' :
Dr. Stone was the first witness called.
He said he had been summoned to attend
Mrs. Hunt and was not long in discover
ing her true. condition. The witness said
that he refused to continue in the case
unless given the name of the party wno
had performed the operation. Mrs. Hunt
at first refused to do this, but later said it
was Mrs. Wegener. Dr. Tavlor, who also
attended Mrs. Hunt, corroborated this tes-.
timony. Mrs. Wegener wsw then called.
She denied knowing the deceased or that
she had ever called upon or attended her
in any way.
After a few moments' deliberation the
jury returned the following verdict: "The
crime was committed by a person to the
jury unknown." This was not satisfactory i
to the Coroner, who ordered the woman
taken to the City Prison, where she was
charged with the crime.

The State Claims Salvage.
some weeks ago the revenue cutter Hartlej
dropped her. bronze propeller, wortlj $200, in
the bay. . A few days later one of the State
dredgers picked ,up the valuable article near
the seawall, which fact reached thÂ£ ears of the
commander of -the cutler, Lieutenant â¢ Butt.
That gentleman made a formal demand for the
return of the propeller, but the engineer of the
dredger refused to give it up unless paid the
Mim of $180," which he claimed :as salvage.'
Yesterday Assistant United suites District At
torney Knight made a formal demand on the
Harbor Commissioners for the return of the
article in dispute. Intimating that unless the
request was immediately accede.d to a writ of â 
replevin and suit for damages would follow.
Mr. Knight further ?aid that if the State had
any claim against the Government, the proper
form of procedure would be to present a formal
bill for the same. â  - ' âº â¢

DYING FROM A
BRUTAL BEATING
Michael Lynch, a Laborer,
Assaulted by Three
Hoodlums.
Knocked Down, Kicked, and
Stabbed Behind the Right
Ear.
ERYSIPELAS HAS SET IN.
Martin Boyle, a Boy, Arrested on
Suspicion of Being Impicated
in the Assault.
Michael Lynch, a laborer living in the
rear of 915 Battery street, is suDposed to
be dying at the Cityand County Hospital
from injuries he received at the hands of
three hoodlums Sunday night.
Lynch was walking along Vallejo street
somewhat under the influence ot liquor.
When near Battery street three young
hoodlums, without, any provocation, at
tacked him. He tried to defend himself,
but he was no match for them. They
knocked him. down, and while on the
ground they beat him and kicked him on
the head, arms, body and legs, and one
of them stabbed him behind the right ear.
Lynch was left lyins; on the street in a
semi-conscious condition til.l a policeman
arrived and sent him tp the Receiving
Hospital in the patrol wagon. Dr. Fitz
gibbon dressed the wound behind his right
ear and he was sent home.
Yesterday morning Lynch was found to
be in a critical condition. The police were
notified and he was- taken to the Receiv
-rnjf Hospital. Dr. Weil examined him
and ordered his immediate removal to tho
City and County Hospital.
Lynch's arms and lejrs a^e a mass of
black bruises from the kicking he received.
His skull is supposed to be fractured in
several platies and erysipelas has set in
lrom the wound behind ' his riitht ear,
which wa3 evidently made with a pair of
scissors. Wjth the faint hope of saving
his life art operation will be performed
upon him to-day.
From information received Policeman
Hen ne berry weni to Gruy- Brothers'
stables to arrest Martin Boy-le, a toy about
18 years of Mfc employed there. As soon
as Boyle saw the officer he ran, but wa>
overtaken and captured .on Montgomery
street, near California, and promptly
handcuffed. _ .
Boyle was taken by Henneberry to the
City and County Hospital to be identified
by Lynch, but when they reached there
the wounded man was unconscious and in
a high fever.
Boyle was taken to the City Prison and
will "be detained pending the result of
Lynch's injuries. H& pretended to bÂ«
very much surprised at his arrest and said
he knew nothing whatever about Lynch
or his injnries.
Policemau Henneberrv has a different
story to tell. He says he has witnesses
who saw the brutal assault upon Lynch
and will be able to identify Boyle as one
of the three.
"I have ascertained," said Henneberry,
"that the wound behind the ear was
caused by a pair.of scissors, anp I thins I
will be "nble to prove beyond doubt that
Boyle did it. He has a bad name in the
neighborhood. He lives with his parents
on Vailejo street, between Battery and
Fron t.
''I think I will be able to lay my hands
on the other two boys, but will know
definitely to-morrow."

MICHAEL CASTLE
DIES SUDDENLY
Lifeless Body of the Pio
neer Merchant Found
in Bed.
His Demise Was Not Known
Until the Family Sought
to Arouse Him.
APOPLEXY WAS THE CAUSE.
A Review of His Long and Honorable
Mercantile Career in San
. . Francisco.
Michael Castle, v pioneer merchant of
San Francisco, was found lifeless in bed
yesterday morning at his home, on the
southwest corner of Washington and
Octavia street-. His end must have been
painless, as the family did not know of his
demise until they sought to arouse him
THE LATE MICHAEL CASTLE.
â¢â "'.. [From a photograph by Taber.] â¢ .
lor breakfast yesterday morning. The
physicians ascribe his death to apoplexy.
Mr. Castle complained of indigestion
Wednesday morning,, but went down town
as usual and passed a few hours at the
Bohemian Club in accordance with his
daily custom.
Michael Castle was born in England
seventy- tour years ago. He came to
America when he was quite a young man
and passed some time in Canada and New
York. He sailed for California from New
York in the summer of 1849, but the
voyage was so long and tempestuous aad
the delays on the Isthmus so vexatious
that he did not arrive here until January,
1850.
The original house of Castle Brothers,
importers of coffee and tea, was estab
lished in 1850. Goodman Castle, Fred
erick and Michael Castie constituted the
nrm. Goodwin, the eldest brother, died
first, Frederick next passed away and now
Michael has gone The last named re
tired from the rirm ten years ago and lie
came connected with the house of Macon
dray & Co., but withdrew from active bus
iness six. y?ars ago. The three Castle
brothers -now comprising the firm are
eons of Frederick Castle and nephews of
Michael. N. H. Castle, an attorney-at-
Jaw.residing at San Jose, is a son of Michael
Castle.
In early days James Freeborn, who died
in Paris some time ago, was a member of
the firm. He was a cautious ami some
what timid merchant, while Frederick
Castle was a bold yet sagacious operator.
When Castle would buy coffee by the
cargo Fre'eborn's hair would stand on end.
Frederick Castle went to London in the
early 50's and was there married. Many
old-timers recollect thts dinner that was
given here by the Castles in honor of the
bride's arrival.
Subsequently Michael Castle went to
London 'and married a sister of Frederick' s
wife.
In mercantile circles Michael Castle was
highly regarded as an hono r able, success
ful and upright merchant. He possessed
a vigorous constitution and his habits
were temperate. He walked with an elas
tic step, and acquaintances who were not
familiar with his long and active career in
San Francisco could hardly believe that
lie had passed the allotted span ol three
score years and ten. Hia sudden death
was a great shock to his wife and his son,
N. H. Castle.
GEORGE W. ELDER.
The BnsineHH Community Indorses the
Candidacy of a Good Man.
The following is a sample copy of a tes
timonial now being extensively signed by
merchants of this City:
To the patriotic, law-abiding and order
loving citizens of the City and County of San
Francisco, to every home-owner, be he rich or
poor, we, the undersigned tax-payers, regard
less of party affiliations, cordially and ear
nestly recommend for tbe office of Superin
tendent of Public streets, Highways and
Squares tbe present official street expert of the
Board of Supervisors, the honorable, incor
ruptible, vigilant and fearless George W.
K:der.
He has been tried and found true. He has
keen weighed in the balance and found not
Wanting.
Do you want a public servant who is known
to be honest? If so, vote for Elder.
Do you want a brave official who knows the
right and dares to maintain it? If so, vote
for Elder.
Do you want an official who knows the du
ties of this office, who understands street
work, who 1s familiar with every character
and kind of material used on the streess â in
short, do you want au official who Is abso
lutely competent in every respect? If so. vote
ior Elder.
Do you wish to reward the public official
â¢who was your iriend when you needed a
friend, who had the courage to oppose the
united infamies of all the crooked, dishonest
conspiring rings, which have been banded to
gether to plunder the public during the past
two years? If so, vote for Elder.
Eider's election will be an encouragement
to all office-holders hereafter to be honestâ
Hldei's defeat will emphasize the fact that
bosses, boodlers. treasory-iooters and spolls
poliiiciaus own this town.
Elder's election meens that the decent,
honest, conservative citizens who have some
thing at stake In this community are deter
mined to protect themselves against wanton
pillage 1 by ruthless political freebooters.
As the official expert of the Board of Super
visors for the past two years he caused to be
condemned, torn up and made over nearly
$100,000 worth- of imperfect streets, sewers
and pavements," thereby saving that Burn to
the property-owners.. â  "^

Tahiti, arrived here last night after three
months in "Washington, D. C, and other
parts of the East. He says interest in the
campaign is intense, but that east of
Chicago everything is for the Republican
ticket.
Mr. Doty has been Consul of this coun
try in Tahiti for nine years. It was
through the influence of Senator Stan
. ford that he was appointed. Mr. Doty
was, aÂ» a youth, a page in the United
States Senate.
He says there are a good, many things
under way in Taniti ibat promise to do
much for the ' Tnhitinn Islands. If the
election in the United States goes right it
will have much to do with Tahiti's pros
perity.
"One of the things proposed," said Mr.
Doty, "is a direct steamer line from San
Francisco to Tahiti. I have received a
letter ir.om Tahiti stating that the Spreck
els Brothers have made an offer to the
French Government there sayine that if
it will give a subsidy of $50,000 a year
such a line will be established.
"In fact, the proposition as reported to
me, is stronger than that. They propose
to run steamers from here to Honolulu, as
at present, and then instead of going via
Apia to Auckland to go via Tahiti and
Auckland. In this event Apia would be
left out.
"Sued a line would be of great value to
us. It would shorten the time between
San Francisco and Tahiti by fifteen days.
It" is now ttiirty days By "sailing vessels.
These vessels are very comfortable, but
not beinc run by steam the time is Blow.
"The I) nited States now does 51 per cent
of tbe business with Tahiti, but with this
line its business could be increased to 75
per cent. San Francisco would get busi
ness that now goes to New Zealand. The
quieter time would cuise many people to,
go to Tahiti and coffee and other planta
tions would be started- It is an exceed
inely rich country and coffee promises to bo
the most proti table oi all crops.
'â¢There are about 180 islands in the
group. The population is about 30,000.
It would soon be 60,000, I tnink, with bet
ter facilities lor getting there. I would like
very much to see the direct steamer line
to and' from Tahiti and San Francisco,
with Auckland as the turthermost end, as
proposed."
Consul Doty will leave on Sunday on the
City of Papeete for Tahiti.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1896.
IN THE SIGN
OF CAPRICORN
The White Goat Mascot
of Golden Gate
Valley.
His Dearly Beloved Daily Diet
of Choice Election
Literature.
CAN'T lUSE WITH DEMOCRACY
He Sees in Judge Campbell's Copious
Whiskers a Marked Family
Resemblance.
"Billy McKinley" is the mascot of
Golden Gate Valley, and is believed by
the people in the vicinity of Filbert and.
Laguna streets to possess an unadulter
ated occult power that will land hia name
sake in the White House. Billy is only a
big white goat of sapient brain and a
stomach that never cried, "Holo", enough!"
but Professor "Baldy" Bauer, his chap
eron, who has consulted the picture of the
zodiac-man in the front part of the alma
nac, says the infallible sign of .the Repub
lican victory will be in Capricorn us.' And
the heavenly goat cavorting among' the
constellations imparts an influence,
stronger than that of the Pleiades to his
terrestrial brother. From this deep as
tronomical calculation he stands pat on
the conclusion that Billy as. a mascot is
out of sight. â¢
Fxom the. time that Billy began life
among the.sKyey crags of Telegraph Hill
down to the present he has abundantly
enjoyed life, liberty and the pursuit of the
esculent tomato can. His departure from
his natal rocks came about in- this wise:
One day during early kidhood he ex
tended hia gambols into the camp of the,
quarrymen engaged in slicing down tne
hill and lunched off several packages of
giant powder. Billy was caught by the
workmen just as he was licking up the
crumbs of his meal, and literally â not in
the modern figurative acceptation of the
termâ they didn't do a thinii to him. -He
was loaded for the whole town.
They lovingly and tenderly enticed the
epicure out of the neighborhood, holding
their very breaths for fear of bringing
about a concussion and suddenly starting
the goat's explosive interior up in busi
ness.
Billy wandered down into Golden Gate
Valley, where he either assimilated the
dangerous content? of his stomach or ren
d?red inert the deadly fulminate with a
neutralizing diet of old boots, bits of rub
ber hose and handbills ripped from, the
fences of his environments. Albeit, he
lived and let live the people around him.
The years swept by, but time could not
wither, nor age, nor anything else, pale
the infinite variety, of his' apoetite. Al
ways he was the four-footed personifica
tion of hunger. . Wan- Want marked -him
lor her own, and the proverbial daughters
of the horseleech whoalwayscried, "Give,
give!" were not in it with this importun
ing, food-seeking he goat, arid^Jie thrived
in the midst oi tiis gaunt famine. Noth
ing he could throw his teeth into but
went to make healthy blood, tissue and
nerveâ especially nerve.
Once Billy mounted a roof and proceeded
to eat the rubber insulation off an electric
light wire. He enjoyed himself unmo
lested until the sun went down and the
current was turned on. The several thou
sand volts of force thai plunged into his
surprised system were not digestible, and
Billy quit eeting.. It was the first and
only. time that Billy was ever known to
leave a feed. â¢. . ." â¢
Another time he found the end of a
broken telephone wire lyine in the street
and went at it. He ate along for quite a
Billy, the Mascot, Who Keeps Election Literature Out of Public
Circulation by Putting It Into His Own.
distance, and when a lineman drove him
from his repast he was so full of angry
"hellos" and the other bad electric lan
guage of the girl at "Central" that every
particular hair on his body stood on end.
Billy is taking an active part in the
present campaign and his principal labors
are in getting election literature out of
public circulation â or rather getting it
into his own. Candidate cards being in
season he keeps his table plentifully
supplied with that, article of diet. A few
days ago he found a prize which furnished
him pasturage for seven consecutive hours.
It was a cache of some "please-gjve-me
"lection-card" fiend, and Biliy didn't do a
thing, etc. He will seldom eat a Popo
craticcard â can't fuse with it nothwith
standing the caliber of his digestive
economy â but be gets so mixed up some
times among the manifold tickets that he
will get hold of an unwholesome morsel.
Then he goes down to Bob Smart's saloon
and drinKs from the stale-beer tub under
the keg-rack to take the taste out of his
mouth.
It has been told that one day he came
down to the corner with an empty tomato
can in his teeth and fllled'it for home con
sumption. This may be a campaign yarn.
Ben Fehnemann, editor of the California
Orchard and Farm, is running for the As
sembly in the Forty-first District, and he
ratber enjoys one of those cards, because
it has an agricultural flavor. He can't
abide a "Phelan," neither as a work of art
nor an article of dietary faith. He dotes
on Judge Campbell's ph'Z. for he sees in
the exuberant whiskers of the great jurist
a marked family likeness.
Last Monday he came across a pack of
playing-cards and devoured with great
gusto all but "biz casino." He thought
it was Supervisor Dimond's card. At the
close of the last parade be took part in he
became hungry from bis long walk and
ate up Richard Valentine's banner, with
which he was decorated.
Billy is to take part in the great proces
sion next Saturday evening and will bÂ«.
clothed in bright gold. He will be muzzled

CHINESE CAN'T RETURN,
The Attorney-General Gives His
Opinion ..Regarding
" Laborers.
Very Strict Interpretation of the
Treaty Clause on Return
Certificates.
. An official opinion from the Attorney-
General at Washington, received here yes
terday by the customs officials, declares
tuaC Chinese laborers who have left this
country withbut obtaining the proper cer
tificate cannot return. It also states that
the departing laborer complies with the
conditions necessary to demand a certifi
cate if he files the required papers *'with.
the Collector of Customs of the district
from w"hich he departs," and that -any
rule directing him to file such papers with
the Collector 'of any other district im
poses 'a condition not warranted by the
ireaty. The laborer must appear in per
son before the Collector to secure a cer
tificate of departure and must at the time
show his registration certificate and sat
isfy tho .Collector teat he is the Chinese
laborer therein described. A certificate of
departure cannot be made out and for
warded to the Chinese alter his de
parture-
Collectors of Customs are informed that
hereafter returning Chinese laborers
should not be admitted to this country
except upon presentation of tb? certifi
cate prescribed by Article II of the treaty
with China of March 17, 1894.
The opinion goes onto say that "the
policy of the Government being against
tbe admission of Chinese laborers treaty
provisions making exception should not
be extended by construction .to cases not
falling within the plain scope of the lan
guage used.".
- The only provision in the treaty for the
return of Chinese laborers to tne iJnited
.States is as follows:
The preceding article shall not apply to the
return to Uie United States of any registered
Chinese laborer who has & lawful wife, child
or" parent in the United Statfs, or property
therein of the value of $ 1000, or debts of like
amount due him and pending settlement.
Nevertheless every such Chinese, laborer shall,
before leaving the United States, deposit, as a
condition of his return with the Collector
of Customs of the district from which he
departs, a full description in writing of
Mb family, or property, or debts as afore
said, and shall be furnished by said Col
lector with such certificate of his right to
I return under this Ireaty as the laws of fhe
United States may now or hereafter prescribe
and not Inconsistent with the provisions of
this treaty; and should tho written descrip
tion aforesaid be proved to be false, the right
ol return thereunder, or of continued residence
after return, shall In each case De forfeited.
And such right of return to the United States
shall he exercised within one year from the
date of leaving the United States; but such
right of return to the United States may be
extended for an additional period, not to ex
ceed one year, In cases where by reason of
sickness or other causes 01 disability beyond
his control such Chinese laborer shall be ren
dered unable sooner to return, which tacts
shall be fully reported lo the Chinese Consul
at the port of departure and by him certified
to the R'ltisat'iion of the Collector of the Port
at which such Chinese subject nhs.ll land in the
United States. And no such Chinese labqrer
shall bo permitted to enter the United States
by land or sea without producing to the proper
officer of the customs the return certificate
herein required.

CONTRACTOR FAY
BOSS UP AGAIN
His Intimate Relations
With Mr. Phelan Dis
cussed.
Men Who Do Business With the
Street Department Are
Wary.
DO NOT LIKE THE "PET" IDEA.
Colonel C. L. Taylor Is Gaining Some
Votes That Would Have Been
Democratic.
The recent arrival of young Charley W.
Fay of San Jose and his appearance in
the municipal campaign as the champion
of James D. Phelan, Junta nominee for
Mayor, is still a subject oi spirited dis
cussion among contractors. Mr. Fay is
managing Mr. I'helan's campaign "for all
there is in it," and to this work he is
bringing the same fineness and shrewd
ness that marked hia operations in San
Jose, where he got every contract that he
wehtfor*
The Call's recent telegram from San
Jose and the article which accompanied it
opened tiie eyes of the San Francisco busi
ness men who have business with the
Street Department. They learned for
the first time what a formidable rival, one
who is never satisfied except with a
monopoly of nil business in his line, had
dropped in on this community from the
bustling metropolis of Santa Clara County.
An attempt wm made to make light of
Mr. Fay's prospective power in the muni
cipal government, in the event of Air.
Phelan 8 election, by a street contractor
yesterday. The gentleman was talking to
a number oÂ£ gentlemen in the same line
of business, and argued with apparent
good reason that Mr. Fay is no brighter
than many of the contractors of this City,
.wno are about as shrewd as they make
them, and who,' as the saying goes,
"know a hawk from a handsaw.' 1
"But nÂ» doesn't have to be smart if he
has the Mayor with him." reasoned an ex
perienced contractor, who knows consid
erable of Mr. Fay's persuasive methods.
"If the proposed new charter should be
adopted, and if the people should be so
thoughtless as to elect Mr. Phelan, then
we would soon find that Mr. Fay wourd be
master of the situation; for under the
new charter the Mayor would have al
most absolute control of the street-con
tracting business of the City. Not di
rectly, perhaps, but by the exercise of the
appointing power and the authority which
the charter gives him to suspend or re
move municipal officers at will, he would
be the autocrat of the City, whose merest
whim would be law, and his pet, whoever
that happened to be, would have a dead
cinchâ a lead-pipe mortgage â on every
contract that he wanted. It is easy to guess
that Mr. Fay would be the Mayor's pet.
"Mr. Fay has shown that he wants
everything in sight by the fact that he nas
paved all the streets of San Jose fur
which contracts were ret after his uppear
nr.ee in that city wilh the Dacking of Mr.
Phelan.
"Mr. Phelan himself has admitted that
he is very friendly with Mr. Fay, and ex
plains that Mr. Fay's father' worked for
Phelan senior many years aeo, for which
reason he has backed Mr, Fay in his busi
ness of street contracting, borne say this
backing amounted to $100,000, and it was
generally supposed among business men
that it was a sort of partnership, but as
Mr. Phelan contradicts that of course it
was a mistake. However, it appears from
the circumstances that it is a sort of
'blood-is-thlcker-than-water' feeling that
draws them together, and there is no use
dodgintt'the conclusion that Mr. Fay
would'at least be Mr. Phelan's factotum in
Street Department affairs the moment
that Mr. Phelan should happen to be
elected. He wouldn't need to exercise the
shrewdness with which he is credited in
order to capture and hold the immense
business of the City's Street. Department
that is now distributed among so many
contractors under the present system that
gives all an equal chance.
"I do not mean that Mr. Phelan would
intentionally be unfair to the rest of the
contractors, but Mr. Fay is so smooth as a
connubiator that he would manage the
game dead to rights, taking all the best
jobs and contracts and leaving only the
dry bones to be picked by the outsiders."
The dissemination of opinions iikethese
has caused most of the street contractors
to turn against Mr. Phelan. Some of the
Democrats will throw their support to
Mr. Dimond. the nominee of the JBuckloy
Democrats, but the greater majority will
support Colonel C. L. Taylor, tae regular
Republican nominee for Mayor, who, as
chairman of the Finance Committee of
th' Bonrd of Supervisors for the past two
years, has shown a disposition to deal
fairly with all those who do business with
our municipal government.
KEITH'S SPLENDID GIFT
The Painter Presents a Picture
to the Pioneer Kinder
gartens.
One of His Characteristic Paintings
to Be Dispose! Of at a Chari
table Fete.
The ladies who have the welfare of the
Pioneer Kindergarten Society were most
agreeably surprised Wednerday when W.
H. Keith presented one of his pictures to
tne society. In making the presentation
Mr. Keith explained that he wished to
assist the ladies in their meritorious
work, and also to show his appreciation of
the results accomplished by the Kinder
garten Society. The patrons of the pio
neer organization were more than pleased,
and have determined to make the most of
the prized gift at the entertainment to be
given Saturday afternoon at the residence
of Mrs. W. S. Dv Val, 1012 Pine street.
Mr. Keith did not care to speak about
the picture he had given the ladies that
they might dispose of it at a drawing for
tbe benefit of the Pioneer Kindergarten.
"It is a little sketch," he saidâ "a land
scape showing a bit of forest. There is
nothing to be Â«aid about it. I just wanted
to help the good cause."
Mr. Keith was modest. . The sketch, as
he called it, is a beautiiuf little landscape
in Keith's best styie. It is painted in a
bold, broad way and is full of suggestion.
The strong impression the artist por
trays in this bit of painting is that of a
delightful mood in nature. Tlie picture
has been mounted in an elegant frame
and will no doubt cause considerable
rivalry amoner the fashionable ladies and
gentlemen who will visit the lete Satur
day afternoon and evening. So it is con
fidently expected that the generosity of
the distinguished painter will swell the
coffers of the Pioneer Kindergarten Society
far beyond the Â»no?t enthusiastic hopes of
those who organized the coming fete.
