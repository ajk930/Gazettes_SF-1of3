PARENTS PLEASED WITH THE
HAPPY MARRIAGE.
Quiet Ceremony at the Breakers, the
Noted Seaside Resort for New
York Swelldom.
NEWPORT, R. 1., Aug. 25.â The long
anticipated and widely heralded wedding
of Miss Gertrude Vanderbilt, eldest
daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and j
Harry Payne Whitney, eldest son of Hon. j
William C. Whitney, ex-Secretary of the j
Navy, took place at noon to-day at ''The j
Breakers," the famous summer house of
the New York millionaire.
Owing to the recent illness of Mr. Van
derbilt the wedding was a family affair
and not a social function.
Half a hundred comprised the party j
which witnessed the tying of the nuptial
knot by Rev. Bishop H. C. Potter of New
York, assisted by Rev. G. T. Magill of
Trinity Church.
The bride came downstairs on the arm
of Hon. Chauneey M. Depew, and was
escorted to the "gold" room, where the
knot was tied. Cornelius Vanderbilt had
been previously wheeled into the room !
and up to the altar, where he too* his
daughter's hand and gave her away.
She was attired in a Worth costume of
â white satin, trimmed with lace, and wore
her mother's wedding veil caug' t up with
orange blossoms. The mnids wor*Â» mous- j

The Morning Room at "The Breakers," Where Gertrude Vanderbilt
Became the Bride of Harry Payne Whitney.
Dorothy Whitney, sisters of the bride
and groom, attired in organdie muslin
with Valenciennes iace trimmings, were
maids of honor.
The bridesmaids, representing great
wealth, were Miss Minnie Taylor, Miss
Gerry, Mis? Edith Shepard, Miss Emily
Bloane, Miss Lelia Sloane â the last three
being Miss Vanderbilt's cousins.
The groom was attended by his brother,
Pavnr Whitney, as best man, who came
from Europe for the purpose. The ushers
were : Alfred G. Vanderbilt, brother of the
bride; C. C. Baldwin, R. L. Connel, P. H.
MtMillan and F. L. Polk.
The wedding breakfast was served in
the palatial dining-room.
The San Francisco Call.
The marriage is not only a matter of
great moment to that part of the people
called society, but of unusual interest to
the general public, for this union will
bring into close relations two of the rich
est families on the American continent.
Its importance to the world of wealth and
fashion is thus easily accounted for, but
the great public is attracted by another
and a better consideration, the fact that
the ceremony will be the fitting finale of
an ardent, old-fashioned courtship â that
is to say, people recognize this as a love
match and they are pleased with it.
The story of riarry Whitney's fair, but
untiring and finally victorious, rivalry
with young Moses Tayior, a year or so
ago, is known and the world continues to
love a lover. Comparisons are also doubt
less made between the course of true love
as discovered by young Whitney's pros
pective brother-in-law, Cornelius Vander
bilt Jr., and the not too arduous path
which is now leading the ex- Secretary's
son to the altar. The sympathy which
went out to Cornelius Jr. and to Miss Wil
son was not unmixed with deprecation of
the unnlial attitude which his persistency
assumed.
But no shadows of parental antagonism
mar the brightness of the present event.
There is complacency and approval in the
minds of the elders of each household, and
all goes merrily. The world at large ap
plauds because in this alliance at least
there is no taint of the bargain and sale
infection which has found its way into
many of the recent matrimonial transac
tions of the rich.
Harry Whitney and Gertie Vanderbilt
have known each other from childhood,
Their love grew up as they did, before
they knew. The palatial Vanderbilt man
sion on Fifty-seventh street, New York, is
only across the way from the noble resid
ence oithe Whitneys. The association of
tiie children of these families has always
been intimate. At Yale College Harry
Whitney was the faithful friend ard chum
of Willie Vanderbilt, the brother of the
bride, whe died a few years ago. The
close friendship of these schoolmates
made young Whitney a constant visitor at
the Vanderbilt house, where he and his
favorite girl friend, Gertrude, saw much
of each other.
The romance of the story comes in when
young Taylor commenced his devotional
exercises, with Miss Gertrude Vanderbilt
ps his shrine. Taylor had aleo been a
great chum of Willie Vanderbilt and came
to know his sister very well. The better
acquainted he became with her the more
he liked her. Soon after the rich young
heiress had made her debut in society it
came to the ears of youuer Whitney that
Miss Vanderbilt and Moses Taylor were
engaged to be married. He made no
moan, and there is nothing to warrant the
suspicion that the news caused him to
contemplate suicide. Youne Whitney is,
like his father, a man of purpose and of
action.
Assuming at once that there was no
truth in the rumor, he mentally vowed
that there never should be, anti so he
finished tying his tie and went to Newport.
When he arrived he at once sought Miss
Vanderbilt. Bhe was at the sumptuous
summer home of the Vanderbilts, The
Breakers, and was glad to see him. There
were no more of those unpleasant rumors,
and gossips who whispered that these
j-ouiig people spent a great deal of their
time together began to taik of another en
gagement, and this time their guess was
corr ct.
But howsoever the younger and more
sentimentil-minded may specula 'e con
cerning the ci hemeral matter of their
prospective happiness matter-of-fact peo
ple insist on entertainine themselves by
consideration of the financial aspects of

the case. Â£ nd, indeed, there is something
stupendous in the thought that to these
young people there is to be intrusted the
ownership and care of $50,000,000.
This is a rough estimate, but hardly an
exaggeration, for the wealth of Cornelius
Vanderbilt can not be less than $100,000,
-000, and as his daughter Gertrude is his
favorite, it is not improbable that her
share will be less than $25,000,000, and
young Whitney's inheritance will be little
less than that sum.
Desirable from all points as this pros
pective alliance seems, it should afford
particular satisfaction to the father of the
bride to ue. Vanderbilt marriages of lats
years have not all been unqualified suc
cesses. Besides t^e recent heart-wringing
disobedience of his son, his namesake, he
has experienced much mortification and
displeasure by reason of the marital ma
neuvering of others of his kith and kin.
The matrimonial record of William K.
Vanderbilt has not been a source of pride
to his staid and scrupulous brother, nor
have the law preceedings and weddings of
the once Mrs. Willie K. added to the com
fort which he formerly found in contem
plating the immaculate respectability of
the family name. But Gertrude has been
dutiful and wise. He will dower her weli.
DOULIN PROVES A N ALIBI.
WaÂ» Killed Many Mile* From the Scene
of the Stage Robbery.
GUTHRIE, O. T., Aug. 25.â The stage
coach between Grande and Arapahoe, in
Day County, was held ap by four high
waymen yesterday morning and the four
occupants ordered to stand and deliver.
Mrs. Amy Childs of Philadelphia refused
to alight and was shot dead. The robbers
secured over $300 in booty from the three
other passengers and escaped.
The driver reported that the man who
fired the fatal shot was Bill Doolin, the
noteu outlaw who escaped from jail here
six weeks ago. This morning, however,
news was received that shows that Dooiin
was guiltless of the crime. He was killed
in a fight last night with deputy marshals
under the command of Heck Thomas hear
Ingalls, fifty miJes northeast of here. A
marshal was also wounded. The posse is
en route to this city with Doolin's body in
a covered wagon. It will be officially
identified and then turned over to his wile
for burial. The fight took place close to
Doolin's old home, t;.e marshals waylay
ing him as he was leaving from a visit to
his wife and baby.
The place where Doolin was killed was
fully 300 miles from the scene of the stage
robbery.

DANGEROUS AGITATION.
All True Republicans Warned
of the Grave Import of
the Campaign.
PROSPERITY AND INTEGRITY.
These Can Only Be Secured, Say the
League Le-aders, by the Election
of McKin'ey.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Aug 25.â The
ninth annual convention of the National
League of Republican Clubs assembled in
Exposition Hall to-day with an attend
ance of delegates and spectators which did
not equal expectations. This was due in
a large measure to the inability of the
managers to secure the presence of speak
ers of National reputation, owing to the
exigencies of the campaign and demands
of local conventions in various States.
The two sessions were devoted to the
preliminaries of the convention, and in
the afternoon notable addresses were made
by Congressman McCleary of Minnesota
and A. B. Cummings of lowa, who bore
to the convention the greeting and good
will from the National Committee.
To-rrorrow's sessions will be devoted to
the consideration of committee reports,
with a mass-meeting at night. The elec
tion of officers will probably occur Thurs
day.
It was 11 :15 o'clock when President Mc-
Alpin called the convention to order. His
appearance evoked loud applause from
the New York delegation. He introduced
Rev. W. A. Hunsberger, pastor of Grand
avenue M. E. Cnurch, who opened the
proceedings with prayer.
Addresses of welcome were made by
Mayor W. O. Rauschenberger, Irving M.
Bean, chairman of the local executive
committee in charee of the convention
arrangements, and Samuel A. Harper,
president of tne Wisconsin State League.
His statement that Wisconsin was in
favor of a protective tariff evoked greater
applause than any other sentiment. Re
sponse was made to these addresses on
behalf of the National organization by D.
D. Woodmansee of Ohio. His allusion to
the title given to Bryan, "the boy orator
of the Platte," as being peculiarly appro
priate, "the river being 2500 miles long
and six inches deep," was received with
shouts of laughter.
President McAlpin read his annual ad
dress. In the course of it he said :
It I understand the political conditions
aright and interpret correctly, the ncUons of
the various conventions that followed the Re
publican convention, we appeal to our fellow
citizens above and beyond our belief In our
own party, along lines broader and higher
than that as a matter of patriotism, there
shall be a united front opposed to those who
are trifling with the Nation's credit, disturb
ing her business interests or appealing to hu
man prejudices as a means of arraying section
against section or class against class in the
hope of gaining political preferment.
Have sacrificed lives and treasure ceased to
teach their lesson? Grave indeed is the re
sponsibility upon any man who would try, as
he stands within the shadow of the rebellion,
to deliberately divide the country into sec
tions, ncr people into classes, arraying them
against each other either for personal advan
tage or to subserve political ends. Such a
course although begun merely in public dis
cussions will, if persisted in, threaten the per
manency of our institutions. That such an
effort will not be successful, I firmly believe.
As the blood courses through the human
body and by its various functions sustain life,
so does an honest currency passing* through
the channels of trade sustain the prosperity of
our citizens and establish the Nation's integ
rity. We are contending, therefore, with other
objects, for honesty in Government, the in
violability of contract rights and the assurance
to every one in return for his labor or in
exchange for commodities of a full and honest
dollar.
We are all creditors and we are all debtors.
We cannot cheat others without cheating
ourselves. Our present money standards are
neither the result of chance nor conspiracy,
but are rather the outgrowth of experiment
and the result of centuries of progress. The
Government can neither make value or give It
without a consideration. To ask, therefore,
that it shall create a dollar of intrinsically
half its normal value and force its acceptance
at its face value, is to ask the Government to
actually take property from our citizens and
commit legalized robbery. That money must
necessarily be the best money whose intrinsl
cal value Is nearest to its declared value
wherever it may be presented for use.
We are told br our political opponents, re
cently assembled at Chicago, that the Govern
ment shall coin the silver of the world into
dollars actually worth 53 ceuts in merchan
dise value and declare them worth 100 cents.
The uovernment must, therefore, present
from its own fund of credit 47 cents of value,
or by statutory enactment rob its citizens of
that amount of property which they have al
ready accumulated.
For myself I protest against the inconsist
ency which denounces the existence of trusts
and at the same time seeks to compel the Gov
ernment to take the entire product of one field
of industry at a specific price, measured by an
absolute standard and to disburse it at a ficti
tious one. Such a cour-e is opposed to the
spirit of our institutions and contrary to the
functions of government. Tne Nation's integ
rity resis not alone upon the surplus in its
vaults, but in the reserve power of labor in its
citizens find their capacity and opportunity
for employment. To continually draw upon
the one will as surely dissipate it as will free

values and abnormal standards destroy the
other.
Upon the tariff General McAlpin said:
We believe that the doctrine of protection
wisely incorporated into our statutes would
not only yield sufficient revenue for our Na
tionnl needs, but would furnish and assure to
our citizens sufficient opportunities for labor
to furnish just returns therefor, reviving our
industries and establishing prosperity among
those who arc willing and ready to work.
I have full faith in the honesty of the Ameri
can people. Ido not believe that they can be
deceived into doing what is for their own per
sonal disadvantage any more than they can be
led to turn their backs upon a line of policy
which hns mado it possible for them to gather
and preserve what they have. I will esteem it
my greatest honor to have presided over our
deliberations, if the results of this convention
shall tend to rewaken our patriotism, stimu
late our love of country and raise again to the
gaie of the people of the earth the banner of
our Nation's nonor and integrity. This can
best be accomplished by the election of
McKinley and Hobart and a Congress that will
take care of the interests of the whole people
for the greatest good to the greatest number.
On motion of Raymond of Illinois it
was ordered that all resolutions be referred
without debate to the committee on resolu
tions.
A motion by Biggins of Indiana was
agreed to directing the secretary to send a
greeting to Messrs. McKinley and hobart
and pledging the support of the league
clubs to the ticket nominated at St. Louis.
Secretary Dowling read the following
telegrams:
Canton, Ohio, Aug. 24.
I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am con
strained to adhere to my declination of your
invitation to attend the meeting of the Re
publican clubs. William McKinley.

I cannot possibly leave the New York head
quarters. My presence there is imperative.

OLD ORCHARD, Mb., Aug. 25.â Hon.
Thomas B. Reed was the central figure at
the great Republican mass- meeting this
afternoon. The speaker was in fine form
and his points were received with great
applause. He said :
What seemed the great primeval curse, that
in the sweat of his face snould man eat bread,
has Deen found in the wider view of the groat
cycles of the Almighty to be the foundation of
all sound hope, all progress and all permanent
power. Man no longer shuns labor as his
deadliest foe, but welcomes it as his dearest
friend. Nations no longer dream of riches as
the spoils of war, but as the fruits of human
energy directed by wise laws and encouraged
by peace and good will. Battlements and forts
and castles, armies and navies fire, day by day,
le s s and less the engine of slaughter and more
and more the guarantee of peace and honor.
What the world longs for now is not the
pageantry an-i devastation of war for the ag
grandizement of the few, but the full utiliza
tion of human energy for the benefit of all
mankind. To the 75,000,000 people which make
up the Great Republic, the opportunity to labor
I menne mere than to all the *vorld besides.
It means the development of resources greatly
beyond the comprehension of any mortal and
diffusion among all of riches to which the
glories of the Arabian Nights are but
the glitter of the pawnshop, and to
which the sheen of all the jewels of
this earth arc but the glimmer of the glow
worm in the pallor of the dawn. But each
Individual man it weak and powerless. Only
by combination, each with the other, can
good results be had. No more striking proof
of this can anywhere be found than in thet
complex union of men which makes up the
modern nations and modern enterprises. The
nature of man craves also liberty and indi
viduality. Modern union and the complex,
wonderfully complex, condition of modern so
ciety has drawbacks and sorrows which are
completely its own. The sachems of New Eng
land had no, financial troubles, no strikes.
The currency question was a simple string of
wampum. In Central Africa to-day banks
never break, checks are never dishonored, for
neither banks nor checks are needed tor their
kind of prosperity. Before the factory system
rendered combinations of workmen needful
there was less discontent, but also no progress,
and there was no sharing by the toiler of the
profits and the pleasures.
What are the causes of prosperity and what
are the causes of panic? Are they mysterious
things beyond the human ken ? If you
analyze you will find that whatever the re
mote causes, and they are different every
time, the immediate cause of prosperity is the
confidence of all the people in each other and
in the situation in the future. When the peo
ple all work together, when they till have
faith in each other, then prosperity reigns.
After prosperity reigns for some time, longer
or shorter, men think that hard times are per
manently done away with and get wild, and
over - prosperity sets in. Then gome wise
men â earlier than others to see that the
world cannot absorb all that is made, cannot
permanently support all the enterprises which
the over-confidence of men has set in action â
begin to doubt, to refuse discounts, to hoard
money and call a halt to speculation. Then
the .distrust spreads and hard times follow.
Then we set to work to climb out of our trou
bles, and the process is slow. While we are
climbing out we suffer.
In 1820 England had one of those paroxysms
like the one we are passing through now.
Everything there had been prosperous for a
long time. The hum of industry was heard all
over the land. Men's eyes looked into each
other with trust and faith in all mankind.
Capital was accumulated in legitimate busi
ness, which is the supplying of each other's
wants. Then accumulated capital, eager for
employment, burst the restraints of society
and speculation set in.
Companies were formed to do everything
under the sun and lend everybody money,
from the Czar of Russia to the King of the
Mosqui.to shore. Pretty soon, after a slight
drain of gold, it occurred to some one to figure
up all of these contracts, and the astonished
nation found that England had agreed to lend
more money than there was in the world twice
over. Then the bubble burst, merchants
failed, banks broke, universal distrust poured
over the land. For one day trade absolutely
ceased in London. Nobody would take any.
body's notes or buy anybody's securities.
Where was the difference between England2
prosperous and England at a standstill? It
was all in the change of one word. Confidence
waÃ prosperity. Distrust was ruin.
Then began the slow growth of confidence
again, which took years, but England's pros
perity did not perish. In our own country we
have had many such instances, many more
than I mean to mention, for history on that
subject is as cheap and abundant as wheat
when times are hard. We have just passed
through another of those terrible crises and
are on our way to other years of wealth, with
this additional benefit, that the distribution
of wealth, when we reach It, will be more
even, as well as more abundant, than ever be
fore. In 1893 we had es great a crash as we
had in 1873; all the world went with us, but
for special causes we had gone further, and it
is for us a longer way back. In 1892 we
thought hard times had been banished for
ever; we were sure that work and high pay
were never more to be separated, but we were
mistaken. Pride goeth before destruction and
a haughty spirit before a fall. The election of
1892 was a great misfortune. It may be we
would have had a collapse then ; no one can be
quite sure. But if we had been in skillful
hands we should never have gone so far or
suffered so much.
When the Sherman act was struggling to be
repealed the Democratic press and even some
Republicans told us that repeal would be the
final remedy and business would Revive. I
never shared that belief. On the contrary,
jÂ«st three years ago to-day, lacking two days,
while I was consorting with good Democrats,
and I hope to consort with the like in this cam
paign, I took occasion among 3000 men, women
and children, to declare that the repeal of the
Sherman law was only one step in the onward
march. Since then many bad things have
happened, plunging us deeper and deeper in
the mire. In that very discourse I told the
Democrats that I did not expect the Demo
cratic party to be "utterly bad," but I had not
at that time the slightest idea what the Chi
cago convention would do or say in 1896.
Since that speech in '93 we have had a severe
lesson. When the tariff act proposed
by Mr. Bryan and his associates was pre
sented in the House it was certainly
a great shock to the business interefts
of the country. The change was radi
ical, and men like Mr. Bryan were car
ried away with the possibilities of their
eloquence. There seemed no possibility
to the limit of the evil. Now, Ido not pro
pose to charge Democrats with 'ha.t bill. The
one they finally passed was a vastly different
one. But the mischief had been done. The
shock had stopped business. Then came the
income tax, unconstitutional and destructive
(declared so by the Supreme Court), and then
the attendant deficiency. That deficiency has
been a breeding sore ever since. That de
ficiency, by the way, has scared and frightened
our people beyond all reason. What is $400,
-000, 000 increase of debt to a Nation so rich
that one of its big railroads on half its lines can
lose twice as much as paid the whole revenue
of good Queen Bess in the days of her highest
glory and never pass a coupon or refuse a div
idend ? Why has this $400,000,000 frightened
us so T Because the Government has refused
either to raise revenue or separate the deficit
from the redemption of greenbacks. Had the
House revenue bill of l&si session passed Con
gress and become a law the country, with full
hope in a RepuDlican administration in the
near iuture, would then have started upward
and onward.
But the condition has been peculiar. We
have a three-cornered, triangular government.
Everybody has been in the minority, and
hence nobody has had any responsibility, and
we have drifted, sailless and rudderless, but,
thank God, with a stout ship, stouter than all
the vrinds that blow. When next you put that
ship in commission had you not better have
a harmonious captain and crew, all of them
men who have beeu to sea? I know that the
four gentlemen, Messrs. Bryan and Watson
and Bryan and Sewall have been at sea for
many years, but that is a different thing.
We must restore confidence. How can we
restore confid ence? First, by putting anarchy
down and a.l manner of disturbance. Peace
and a stable government are the first neces
sity. This is a borrowing and lending world.
No amount of denunciation of money-lenders,
no wild talk about Wull street, which, Dy the
way, is the greatest money-borrower in the
world, will ever put down that fact. Enter
prises are carried on by the united confidence
and money of men of brains. Bring this thing
home to yourselves and then you will under
stand it. If you had money or any other
capital you had earned yourself or your father
bad left to you, or even if you had won it in
the luck of lottery, would you let it out to
anybody on earth who was liable to give you
back only half of it and want to call v square?
If you were a business man would you make
things on a gold basis and sell them on credit
to a people who are trying to se>. if they could
not pay you on a silver basis? *With the de
feat oi the Bryan-Watson-Sewall combination
will come the certainty of the repayment of
capital borrowed at home end abroad, the cer
tainty that business enterprise will have a
firm foundation', and 1897, with its attendant
years of success, will Uit us to another height
of success where, perhaps, another set of mis
guided citizens, forgetful of the past, will way
lay us, and we shall have to beat them back
again. Remember that this contest to-day is
not between bimetallism and monometallism.
That subject would bear discussion. This con
test is between silver monometallism, which
we have not, and gold monometallism, which
we have. That subiect will not bear candid
discussion. This contest also is not between
the East and West. There can be no such con
test Our interests are identical. With|their
growth comes our growth. We cannot go on
alone. We have sent our children there, our
money there. No misfortune can happen to
them that does not happen to us.
We here have full esteem for the pioneers of
the West and rejoice in their prosperity.
Every wise man agrees that beyond thÂ« Mis
sissippi lies the great wealth of the days to
come. In the development of this wealth we
are all interested, and we in the East are not
the unwise men to believe that we are. not
concerned in the progress and future of the
West. Unfounded sectional differences are
without excuse, and it will be woe to those
who try to foment them. The West is too vig
orous not to find out the truth, and it is too
valiant not to follow it when found. Ail the
West needs is loanable capital, which will
develop its own resources. No part of this
Union is so concerned in restoring confidence
as the undeveloped territory. The South, too,
has a similar interest. But they are busy down
there just now asserting their rights and keep
ing down the negro. If they conld be per
suaded to look after their interests what a
happy country this might be.
These financial matters are governed by
natural laws and take their course like the
rolling of the round earth or the glitter of the
stars. Supr O6e â  man were created full grown
and set upon a solitary earth facing the dawn.
As the panorama of sunrise, the march of the
fountain of light across the sky, the red sun
set and the black darkness came over him
what could he make of this termination of
the gorgeous pageantry of the skies ? Noth
ing but darkness, desolation and death and a
wild calling on the unknown gods for help.
But the man who has from earliest boyhood
seen the sun disappear into the red to reap
pear another day may be ignorant of tne
keeper's laws and of Galileo's faith, but he
knows no greater certainty on earth than that
the day follows night. A man who has only-
Ken 1893 might well wonder and call for
rescue, but, we, who have seen 1873, and have
read of 1825 and 1851 in England, and 1837
in America, know that we shall assuredly rise
again to business and prosperity as that to
morrow's sun shall rise.
Be not deceived by a false prophet In the
West they tell the people that Maine is falter
ing. You and I know she never was so stead
fast. Here in the East they tell us the West is
blazing with silver crosses and is crowned
with silver thorns, bnt when the tug of battle
comes the gallant West, peopled by our chil
dren, will show to the'worid that brothers,
true and tried, who have fought so many
fights shoulder to shoulder In the grrat con
flict of human progress, will never be sepa
rated from each other or from that great party
around which clusters all the glories of the
most illustrious yearstof this country ' 6 history.

dared to Be Composed of Odds and
Ends of Political Lunacy.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 25.â The sound
money Democrats of Illinois in State con
vention to-day placed themselves on
record in favor of the gold standard and
named the following ticket: Governor,
General John C. Black; Lieutenant Gov
ernor, Chester A. Babcock, Quincy ; Sec
retary of State, Charles S. Wiley, Coles
County; Auditor, Henry W. Brink, Wash
ington County; Treasurer. Edward
Rodgers, Springfield; Attorney-General,
Hon. W. S. Forman, St. Clair; trustees of
the University of Illinois â S. H. Bussey,
Champlain; C. E. Babcock, Cook County;
August Niehaus. Peoria,
The convention was called to order in the
ball of Battery D by Chairman Ewing of
the State Executive Committee at 12:30
o'clock. There was a large attendance of
spectators, the galleries being crowded
long before the convention was called to
order. The reading of the call for the con
vention having been dispensed with,
Chairman Ewinp reviewed the organiza
tion and progress to the present time of
the sound-money movement in Illinois
ami throughout the country. His refer
ence to the sound-money Democracy as
"exclusive Democrats" was cheered, and
an outburst of applause, long continued,
greeted the first reference to President
Cleveland. The mention of Senator Pal
mer brought forth another hearty demon
stration, as did references to Secretary
Carlisle and Henry Watterson. Governor
Altgeld's name was received with a storm
of hisses.
Hon Lloyd F. Hamilton of Sangamon
County, was named as temporary chair
man and said :
"We are not bolters. We are the Demo
cratic party. We stand by ttie faith of
our fathers and against the waves of popu
lism, socialism and anarchy which beat
up against our ranks. Under the mad
and frantic cry of free silver, all the odds
and ends of political lunacy have banded
themselves together to bring ruin and dis
aster upon the country. To stand like a
wall o! burnished brass against the en
croachment of these insane delusions is
the great mission of honest money Demo
crats."
After the appointment of the us ual com
mittees, Senator Palmer made a speech
and was followed by ex-Congressman For
man. The convention then at 1:55 p.m.
took a recess until 3 p. m.
Upon re-assembling the committee on
credentials reported ail delegates present
entitled to seats. The committee on per
manent organization recommended the
electicn of Hon. John Eckels, Comptroller
of the Currency, as permanent chairman
and that the temporary organization
other than chairman be made permanent.
The report was adopted unanimously.
Upon taking the chair Mr. Eckels was
roundly applauded. Among other things
he said: "We are here to name candi
dates who are Democratic to enunciate
principles that have been Democratic
throughout all the history of the party.
We are here to make no alliance with
Populists, to have no dealings with social
ists. We are here as the champions of the
plain people of this country."
After comparing the two great parties
in their past record Mr. Eckels referred to
State affairs and evoked great applause by
declaring that Altgeldism is not Jeffer
sonian Democracy. He declared the duty
of Democrats is to take up the work of
conserving the public good, of saving the
individual rights oi person and property,
and protested against a financial policy
recognized in no European mart, but only
in Asiatic marts ana which he pronounced
"a coolie system as much as is the
Asiatic system of labor."
Of the silver Democratic party, he de
clared that it is a Democracy born of Pop
ulism and Republicanism. It ia the spuri
ous foundling placed upon the doorstep of
the Democratic party. He referred to
Grover Cleveland as ''one of the greatest,
one ot the most profound, one of the most
patriotic Democrats that ever sat in the
Presidential chair," a statement that
brought forth great applause, as did every
mention of President Cleveland's name.
He said the silveritei scored him and re
fused him an indorsement because un
aided by the legislative branch of the Gov
ernment he had maintained tne credit of
the Government ana prevented universal
bankruptcy.
"When November comes," he concluded,
"there will be such an onslaught of voters
as will bury them beneath an avalanche
so great that they will nevei appear again
as leaders of the Democratic party."
The committee on delegates at large
recommended tbe names of General John
M. Palmer, General John C. Black, Hon.
W. S. Forman, Hon. John P. Hopkins,
Hon. Benjamin T. Cable, Hon. Henry 8.
Bobbins, Hon. C. A. Ewing and Hon. 11.
C. Sullivan as delegates at large to the
National Convention, each to have one
half vote. The report was adopted with
out opposition.
Senator Palmer placed in nomination
for Governor John C. Black, referring in
eloquent terms to General Black's distin
guished services and declared thai his hon
esty was so far above suspicion that there
was no danger of his ever being even ac
cused of having borrowed State funds for
his personal use, as had been charged
against both Tanner and Altgeld. General
Black's nomination was made unanimous
and the other officers were named in the
same manner.
The platform reported by the committee
on resolutions and adopted with enthusi
asm is very lengthy. It declares that the
Democratic party is primarily and solemn
ly pledged to liberty regulated by law; to
equal justice to all men of whatsoever con
dition and persuasion, religious or politi
cal; to economy; to peace and honest

friendship with all nations and entangling
alliances with none; to the payment of
debts in honest money and to the main
tenance of the public faith, and is opposed
to class legislation and indorses "every
act, executive, legislative and judicial, of
the present Democratic National adminis
tration."
It declares that the gold dollar is now
and for more than sixty years has been
the American standard of value, fixed by
Democratic statesmen who are opposed to
a debased and fluctuating currency, and
that it is the measure upon which private
and public fath has rested and now rests
and declares unreservedly in favor of
maintaining that standard.
It favors the use of silver as currency
and the coinage and circulation of such
quantities thereof as can be kept at parity
with gold coin, but opposes the free and
unlimited coinage of silver by the United
States Government as a measure certain
to impair contracts, disturb business, di
minish the purchasing power of the wages
of labor, inflict irreparable injury upon
commerce and industry and fasten an in
effaceable stigma upon the financial honor
of the American people.
Succeeding sections demand the retire
ment of the United States from tne bank
ing business and the gradual reduction
and cancellation of all United States
treasury notes; charging to the monstrous
McKinley tariff and the McKinley-Sher
man silver purchase act, neither of which
could have passed a log-rolling, money
wasting Congress without the other,
the panic and depression of 1893
and succeeding years; denounce Re
publican protection as a fraud and
robbery of the many for the few; de
clare for tariff for revenue, only ; score the
Republican National Committee as domi
nated by the intriguing attorneys of fav
orite interests and tbe Democratic Na
tional Convention as controlled by agents
of the silver mining interests, agitators
and demagogues.
Continuing tha platform declares "un
compromisingly in favor of the constitu
tional independence of the United States
Supreme Court as one of tbe three co-ordi
nate powers of this Government," and es
pecially commends President Cleveland
for his impartiality in the selection of the
members of this court.
Having completed tbe ticket as named
the convention at 5:15 o'clock adjourned
sine die.

The attendance of delegates and boom
ers was the greatest in many years, when
at 12:20 p. m. Benjamin B. O'Dell, chair
man of the executive committee, called
the convention to order. He presented the
name of Frank S. Black as the selection of
the State Committee tor temporary chair
man.
Bishop John P. Newman offered a
prayer. At the conclusion of the prayer
the crowd in the gallery broke loose and
shouted: "We want Platt; we want
Platt." The band was started to stop the
disturbance.
Representative FrankS. Black was unan
imously elected temporary chairman. He
was received with cheers and handclap
ping. On taking the chair he spoke briefly,
but was loudly applauded as he excoriated
the Democratic party.
The usual committees were appointed
and then at 1:20 p. m. the convention took
a recess until 5 p. h.
The convention again met ats:2o o'clock.
Chairman Van Alen of the committe on
credentials reported that fifteen contests
were before the committee, and in all save
two ;he committee bad decided to award
the seats to the delegates whose names
were on the temporary roll.
A delegate from Oneida moved that the
Oneida contest be voted on separately.
Btfore the motion was put Warner Miller
rose from a seat in the Essex County dele
gation. The chair asked from what county
the gentleman came. Mr. Miller replied
"from Herkicner."
Otto Irving Wise of New York made a
point of order that Mr. Miller's name does
not appear on the list of delegates and
therefore he could not be heard. Tne
chair ruled the point well taken. Great
confusion followed.
Mr. Platt rose in his place and asked
unanimous consent that Mr. Miller be
heard. There whs .great cheering. The
chair rapped for order, and stated that
there being no objection Mr. Miller would
be heard. Cheers and hisses greeted this.
Mr. Miller said he had never known a
Republican convention in the State of
New York to refuse a hearing to an elected
delegate, whether on the roll or not. He
returned thanks to Mr. Platt for obtaining
him the privilege. There were interrup
tions from the galleries as he proceeded.
He said that he came not to ask a favor,
but to demand justice.
"I come not here to plead for myself
nor for the mere personal honor of repre
senting Herkimer County here as a dele
gate. [A voice: 'Good- by.'] But I stand
here to-day to demand of this convention
that it shall mete exact justice in all the
contests that have been made. Mr. Chair
man, the offer was made to me since I
came here â and it was known that the
State committee had not put my name
and those of my colleagues on the roll â
that I could be substituted in other coun
ties, but I refused. [A voice: 'That's
rightl' and applause.] During all my po
litical life, going back for thirty years, I
have never sought to come into a State
convention or any other convention by
steal tn or by a bacK door. [Applause.J
During all those years I have had behind
me the loyal support of my own people in
Herkimer County [applause], and I do
not come here, sir, begging for myself. I
come simply to defend my rights. And,
sir, if I did not know that I had a fair
and an honest majority of the delegates of
the Republican convention in Herkimer
County I would not be in this town to
day; I would not be in this hall. [Ap
plause.] Mr. Chairman, it matters not to
me whether I am seated in this conven
tion or not, but I shall return to my peo
ple in Herkimer County, who have always
been loyal and who have commissioned
me here now, and like a loyal Republican
I will meet you here again. [Applause.]
Mr. Hasbrouck of Ulster moved to ex
empt from the report of the committee on
credentials the Oaeiaa contest and that of
Herkimer. The motion was lost.
The report of the committee on creden
tials was then adopted without division.
Warner Miller walked out of the conven
tion as the result was announced.
William Barges Jr., chairman of the
committee on permanent organization,
reported the name of Stewart L. Woodford
of Brooklyn for permanent chairman. The
report of the committee on permanent or
ganization was adopted and General
Woodford was escorted to the platform.
General Woodford said in part:
In an evil hour our people listened to the be
guiling voice of the Democratic party whis
pering into the ear of 1 bor that capital was
getting too much and labor too little, and that
if we would eat of the fruit of the tree of free
trade we should all be more happy, more rich,
more prosperous and that the industries of
this country should not surely die. Our peo
ple listened and were beguiled. They gave
this Government over to the Democratic party.
As soon as the result of the election in No
vember, 1892, was known all thoughtful men
in this country and abroad realized that a
party would come into power pledged to a
tar.ff for revenue only and pledged to the re
peal of the McKinley tariff law. No man
couM tell what the new law would be. Doubt
as to tariff then bred disaster and at once, pre
cisely as doubt with regard to the currency
breeds disaster now.
Tiie paralysis in production and business
which began with Democratic success in No
vember, 1892, has continued until now. The
Republican Garden of Eden of 1892 has been
changed into the Democratic desenof 1896.
These things being so, this same party now
comes to the people and says: "Our free-trade
cure-all was a failure. You are not as busy, as
prosperous and as happy as you were four
years ago. But the reason is that we did not
then understand our case correctly. We admit
that free trade alone cannot cure you. But
you are wretched and poor and unhappy now,
simply and alone because you have not enough
silver dollars. We blundered then about free
trade, but we are dead right now about free
silver. To be sure we nearly killed you then,
but give us another chance and we will cure
you."
What idle folly I If Democracy was wrong in
1892, why should we hope that Democracy is
right in 1896? The Democratic surgeon then
found the patient well and yet he cut off the
sound* leg of protection. Now, when the pa
tient is hobbling about on the other leg of
sound money, Democracy proposes to help her
going by cutting off that leg also. The Demo
cratic theory is that a man with no legs can
walk better than with two or even than with
one. It is nonsense and I believe the common
sense oi this people will see it before next No
vember. Confidence is the first necessity oi in
dustrial success. No man to-day dares to put
$1 into any new venture because he does not
know what he will get, nor what he shall
make, nor where he can borrow should his
means run short. No new industry is being or
ganized to-day. Worse than this, the concerns
that have managed to live during the depres
sion of the last four years are to-day giving up
the struggle, one by one, wearied and worn
out. Each day brings us tidings of mills clos
ing and factories shutting down. And yet this
mad crusade for free silver is being preached
against credit and labor and the workingmen
and the farmers are being urged to unite in
a policy that must close the mills and lock the
barns and involve employes and employers in
one common ruin. It is political insanity.
We had our candidate at St. Louis, a candi
date whom iv e honored and whom we followed
loyally and faithfully to the end. When the
convention decided against us we accepted
that decision with the same loyalty and fidel
ity. William McKinley is our candidate and
will be supported with absolute sincerity and
with absolute unanimity. Just as the men of
New York who followed William H. Seward at
Chicago in 1860 came home and carried New
York tor Abraham Lincoln, just as the men cf
New York who were of the Spartan baud of
306 who stood for Ulysses S. Grant in 1880
came home and carried New York for James A.
Garfield, so to-day in your name and by your
command I pledge the Republican party to
the loyal and faithful support of William Mc-
Kinley, and we will give this State to him and
to the Republican cause of protection and
sound money by a great and sure majority
which no Democrat or Populist will care to
cumber.
General Woodford was interrupted at
frequent intervals by facetious remarks
from the galleries. He finished his speech
at 6:40. He called for the report of the
committee on resolutions. Lemuel Quigg
of New York read the report, as follows:
The allied Democratic and Populist parties
say that their success will lead at once to the
free coinage of silver. The Republican party
says that the present gold standard must be
maintained and that the way to recover our
lost prosperity is to return to the wise indus
trial policy by which, under Republican rule,
prosptrity was achieved.
The attempt to make an ounce of gold. equal
in value to only sixteen ounces of silver,
when it is now worth thirty ounces, is hope
less and absurd. The United States could
neither take nor use one-half the silver that
a iree-coinage law would bring to their mints.
This fact is so plain to the world of commerce
and business that the mere announcement of j
the success of the Democratic party would
send gold to more of a premium, drive debtors
into cruel liquidation and cause a farther
withdrawal ot capital from investment and a
further . uspenslon of industry.
No injury could be inflicted upon trade and
commerce, no shame visited upon the Na
tional reputation more hurtful than would be
the enactment of a law compelling the people to
accept in tne payment of debts a coin tor one
dollar which they could not spend lor more
than hah that turn. To allege thai our stock
of money is now sufficient for the transaction
of business is mere assertion, but if it were
the evil it implies would not be cured by a law
the first and instantaneous effect of which
woulfi be to drive out of circulation our entire
supply of gold money, more lhan one-third of
the whole. The employment of all the mint
ing resources of the Government in the coin
age of silver dollars only could not in a period
of fifteen years make up for the deficiency of
circulation that would result from the retire
ment ol gold. The currency per capita is to-day
greater than it has ever been. The people can
take no more money than they can buy with
their labor, and what they can buy its value
and not mere denominations.
To the maintenance of a pure circulation of
dollars of full and equal value the Republican
party is resolutely pledged, and for the firm
establishment of that policy it asks ihe sup
port of every citizen who wishes neither to
cheat nor to be cheated. It must be constantly
borne in mind that the conditions out of
which this agitation for free silver has arisen
were created by the Democratic assault upon
the country's manufacturing industries. If
there had been no interruption of business,
no failure of revenue and no lack of profitable
employment to the people the increase of
$262,315,400 to the face of the bonded debt
which four years of Democratic rule has com
pelled, while in some measure due to the at
tacks in Congress upon the public credit by
the pressure of free-silver bills, had its origin
in a tariff act which converted a monthly
surplus of revenue into a monthly deficit and
exposed domestic production to unjust com
petition. The Republican party is wedded to
no set of rates and bChedules, but its cardinal
principle is the protection of American in
dustry.
A tariff must be enacted which will provide
revenues sufficient to meet the ordinary and
necessary expenses of the Government and so
adjusted as to place American labor without
sacrifice of our high-wage system on at least
equal terms in our own market with tne labor
of other lands.
The nomination of William McKinley and
Garret A. Hobart by the Republican National
Convention is received by the Republicans of
New York with enthusiasm and confidence.
We indorse the platform on which they were
placed before the country and assure to them

HOBART VISITS McKINLEY.
The Republican Candidate* Read the
Letters of Acceptance.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 25.â Major Mc-
Kinley worked nard this morning upon
the final revised prooT of his letter of ac
ceptance. He denied himself to all callers
and was toilinu earnestly, when a carriaee
drove np and Garret A. Hobart alighted
with his letter of acceptance in his travel
ing bag. Mr. Hobart was not expected on
so early a train, and consequently there
was no one to meet him at the station.
Major McKinley met him at the door
and took him into his study. The room
looked like an editor's sanctum, and Mr.
Hobart, laughing at the confusion and
evidence of hard work, said: "Since you
are in the letter-reading business, Major,
I've brought you another one to look
over." The two men tt en sat down and
Major McKinley read Mr. Hobart's letter
and discussed it with him. Mr. Hobart,
in his turn, read Major McKinley's letter.
Each candidate expressed the highest sat
isfaction with the other's letter of ac
ceptance. Major McKinley's letter will
make about 10,000 words and will be given
to ihe public through the medium of the
press Thursday morning. Mr. Hobart's
letter will follow some days later.
Mr. HorSart left for tbe East by way of
Cleveland at 4:30 this afternoon. Before
he left Canton, Major McKinley took him
driving. Mr. Hobart was here two hours
and a half longer than be expected to be
when he arrived. He had ample time to
di?cuÂ«s the whole situation with Major
McKinley. Mr. Hobart brought encour
aging news from the East and expressed
the opinion that the Democratic cam
paign was going by default there. He
said New Jerse/ would give the Repabli
can ticket more than 50,000 plurality.
Among the other callers to-day were up
ward of twenty traveling salesmen, repre
senting all parts of tbe country.
Pennsylvania's Convention.
PHILDELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 25.â The
Democratic sound-money movement in
Pennsylvania assumed a definite shape
here this evening at a State convention
called by the members of the party who
have renounced alieeiance to the Chicago
platform. The gathering, which was a
representative one, was enthusiastic on
the question of a gold standard, and this
being the only issue the convention had
before it there were no contests. Tne con
vention seiected Presidential electors and
electors at large, delegates and delegates
at large to the Indianapolis convention,
chose a State central committee, and

the title of the party in this State.
The convention elected the following
electors at large : William M. Singerly,
Philadelphia; A. S. Landi, Blair; 6. C.

Withdrawal* Aaain Reduce the Gold
Reserve in the Treasury.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 25.â The
treasury gold reserve declined to-day to
?101.872,463. The day's withdrawals were
$95,300. During the past three weeks the
loss of gold at San Francisco by the re
demption of legal tenders has aggregated
$3,500,000, bnt it is believed the movement
there has nearly spent its force.
Tbe treasury was to-day informed that
arrangements for the further import of
gold from Europe to the extent of $10,
-750,000 have been perfected. It i& said there
is now on tbe water bound for this coun
try $2,000,000 in gold, and treasury officials
hope this gold on its arrival will soon find
its way into the treasury.

SILVER SENATORS

TO REJECT TEE NOMINATION.
Soreness Increased by the Change of
Heart of the Ex-Governor of
Missouri.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 25.-It is
jnst possible that ex-Governor Francis
will not be confirmed by the Senate when
his name ia sent by Mr. Cleveland for ap
proval. It is usual for the Senate to con
firm a Cabinet officer without question,
through there have been exceptions, but
in this case there are considerations which
may lead silver men to vote against con
firmation.
The election will be over before the
question can come before the Senate, but
it is not likely that the silver Senators
will then be less irritable than they now
are. Their objecion will be that Mr.
Francis is appointed to succeed a member
of the Cabinet under an administration
elected by Democrats, whose resignation
was the result of his decision to support
tbe regular Democratic nominee. Tbis
involves the repudiation of the regular
nominees by tbe candidate for confirma
tion and the attitude he is to assume in
the campaign will have been fully dis
closed, and the campaign will be a thing
of the past when the question of confirma
tion comes up.
The selection of ex-Governor Francis is
regarded as determining a point on the
question of an anti-Bryan Democratic
organization in Missouri. There is a very
strong gold sentiment among Democrats
in St. Louis ami Kansas City. Ah tbe
gold Democrats need there is a prominent
leader to get up a very impressive and
effective gold Democratic organization.
Ex-Governor Francis, as a consistent gold
man and intimate friend of Mr. Cleveland,
was the National leader of these forces.
Unfortunately, however, it had become
generally understood from what Mr.
Francis bad said after the Chicago con
vention that he would have to, though
with great reluctance, give his support to
the regular Democratic ticket.
Tbis left tbe gold Democrats without
proper leadership, or at least they so
thought. Now, the selection of Mr. Fran
cis to succeed Mr. Smith places him un
mistakably in opposition to Bryan and
Sewall, insures an effective anti-Bryan
Democratic organization in Missouri and
irritates the silver men beyond measure.
It is therefore anticipated that tbe silver
men in the Senate, no matter what the
result of the November election may be,
will seek revenge by the rejection of the
nomination.

Senator and Candidate Form
Some Little Secret
Pact.
BUT NEITHER WILL TELL
Many People Turn Out to See
the Boy Orator at
Albany.
MAKES A TALK FOR SILVER .
Bo'dly Declares That He Indorses
Every Word of the Obnoxious
Chicago Platform.
ALBANY, N. V., Aug. 25.â Ten thou
sand people crowded closely together in
front of the City Hall this evening and lis
tened to William J. Bryan deliver a poli
tical speech, and although the reception
was of an extremely cordial nature and
surpassed in attendance any meeting
which Mr. Bryan has addressed in the
East, it was secondary in general interest
to the dinner given the Democratic candi
date by Senator David B: Hill this after
noon. Exactly what was said at Senator
Hill's residence, or whether any agree
ment between the two leaders of the
Democracy was made, may never be
known, as neither gentleman would speak,
but general opinion naturally ascribes to
the bread-breaking an important place in
the present campaign.
Mr. Bryan's reception on his arrival in
Albany some hours previously had pre
pared him somewhat for that which was
to come. His train from Rhinecliff ar
rived in Albany at 4:05 o'clock. When
the candidate appeared on the car plat
form he found confronting him a pushing,
confused throng and as he was recognized
by those composing it a cheer went up
that shook the rafters in the wide-spread
ine roof.
Ex-Senator Norton Chase and Louis W.
Pratt met Mr. and Mrs. Bryan on the
train on behalf of Senator HilJ, and they
were driven away, followed by much
cheering, to Wolferts Roost, Senator Hill's
suburban home. A reception committee
of 100 Democrats had also met Mr. Bryan
at the station. The Democratic nominee
was scheduled to appear at the City Hall
meeting at 6:30 o'clock, but he was fifteen
minutes late.
A temporary stand, decorated with
bunting, had been erected on the west
side of tbe municipal building, and the
vast multitude which was crowded about
this had begun to gather an hour before
Mr. Bryan made his appearance. A brass
band stationed on the platform gave the
people the first intimation that the young
Nebraskan was near by striking up "Hail
to the Chief." A moment later Mr. Bryan
appeared on the stand, closely followed by
ex- Senator Chase and Collector Pratt.
The cheering that greeted him was like
tbe sound of thunder, and again and
a-ain it came, until Mr. Chase began a
few remarks introducing the nominee.
Mr. Bryan said:
Fellow-citizens: In the presence of this im
mense audience it is hardly necessary to an
nounce that tne Presidential campaign is open
for business. [Applause.] It gives me great
pleasure to be permitted to address, even for a
short time, the citizens of Albany and its vi
cinity. I esteem it a privilege to be able to
denote in your presence the policies which I
believe will bring prosperity and happiness to
the American people.
The Democratic partyat Chicago met in con
vention, and there the majority of the Demo
crats of the United States, speaking through
their legally chosen representatives, laid down
a platform and nominated a ticket. It is not
to be expected that every person will always
find in any platform all that he desires and
nothing that he does not like. But when a
citizen comes to vote he acts with that party
and indorses that platform which gives to him
the best assurances of securing the most im
portant things he desires.
It is properâ aye more, it is necesiaryâ that
the candidates who stand upon a platform
shall indorse the utterances of that platform,
and I stand before you to declare in your pres
ence that I indorse every syllable, every word
of that platform adopted ai Chicago. [This
sentence was delivered with great vigor and
emphasis and was enthusiastically applauded.]
But while I do so I expect in this campaign
the support of many Democrats who are not
willing to indorse all that the platform de
clares for. [The hidden meaning of this sen
tence seemed to be understood by the au
dience, which applauded vigorously.] We
have then to consider this question: Ought
the American people to submit longer to a i
gold standard? [Shouts from the audience of
"No, nol"l The Democratic party has begun
a war of extermination against the gold stand
ard. [Cheers].
We asfc no quarter, we give no quarter. We
shall prosecute our warfare until there is not
an American citizen who dares to advocate the
gold standard. [Loud applause.] They ask,
Why? We reply, That the gold standard is a
conspiracy against the human race and that
â we would no more join in it than we would
join an army marching to despoil our homes
and destroy our families. I ask you not to
take my word alone as to the evils of the gold
standard. I call as a witness a gentleman
whose voice has been heard in the counsels of
the Democratic party. I ask (if you are in
clined to accuse us of using extravagant lan
guage) to listen to the following language.
Here Mr. Bryan quoted at some length
from the speech of Mr. Carlisle on the sub
ject of bimetallism, delivered in the House
of Representatives some eighteen years
ago.
That is the language of John G. Carlisle, and
4 **^%k WMs ERY few people real-
- ize the extent to which
yJEMr'yy substitutionâ the fraud
''^fr%Mm of the dayâ js' carried.
j^\ F m You will have to learn
"â  m arid the best way to
m,--, â i 'â  learn is to let the clerk
talk and talJtâ he can do itâ he will do it.
When tie is ' exhausted tell ; him you
want what you want, and that want is
the genuine
I believe he spoke the truth. If it was true
then.it is true to-day and will be true no
matter who may change his opinion or his
course upon this question. [Applause.] Truths
one* uttered will live, no matter what may
become of those who utter those truths. Some
of our opponents say that they are afraid that
we cannot maintain bimetallism alone. We
reply to them that we have waited for twenty
years for other nations to help us, and if we
are going to restore bimetallism we have got
to restore it alone, because others don't come
to our assistance. [Applause.] More than
that we believe that the assertion of American
independence to bring about bimetallism than
servile dependence upon our enemies to bring
it to us. [Applause.]
Our opponents say that all we need Is a
restoration of confidence. Whenever the con
fidence man is abroad in the community the
man who has the least confidence gets off with
the most money (laughter and applause), and
I am very much afraid that the confidence
man is abroad in this campaign preaching
"haveconfider.ee and all will be well." My
friends, confidence must have a basis to rest
upon. Our opponents say that unless we shape
our financial policy to suit the pleasure of
foreign nations they will not loan us any
money. [Laughter.] We reply that as long as
we shape our financial policy according to
their pleasure we will always be borrowers and
can never be rnoney-loaners ourselves.
If you want to restore confidence you have
got to restore prosperity to the great mass of
people and talk as much about good property
as they have been talking about good money.
Money can be too good. It can be so good that
you can long for it and pray for it, but can't
get a dollar of It [Great laughter and ap
plause.]
I have asserted and I assert that without the
aid of tne money-owning class the gold stand
ard would not stand for one day in any nation
under the sun. I assert that behind the gold
standard in this country the only potent force
consists of those who hold fixed investments
and those who are brokers, who provide or
carry out greater bond issues. Now, my friends,
my time is up. I must leave you to greet other
people.
Mr. Bryan then drove to the station in
time to board his train which left at 8:10
p. m. Mr. Bryan's trip via Summit Moun
tain and Hudson was a series of ovations.
At botn places the candidate made short
speeches in a happy vein.
UTICA, N. V., Aug. 25.â William J.
Bryan ended a three hours' journey from
Albany at Utica at 11:20 o'clock to-night.
Mayor Gibson presented him to the crowd.
While be was speaking part of the plat
form fell carrying a score of people with
it. Several men were slightly injured.
Nearly 3000 people were gathered in the
wide space in iront of the stand. They
manifested their enthusiasm frequently
with vigor and were ready to cheer at
every opportunity.

ernor D. H. Hastings, M. A. Hanna, and
Senators Allison, Cullom, Davis and Wol
cott.
The convention then, at 12:50, took a
recess until 3 o'clock.
Tne proceedings of the afternoon session
were begun at 3:45 o'clock by the Mil
waukee Republican Glee Club, which sang
several campaign songs. Secretary Dowl
ling called the roll of States for the comple
tion of the list of committeemen, vice
presidents and members of the executive
committee.
The following is the executive commit
tee for the ensuing year: A. G. Negiey,
Alabama; Henry M. Cooper, Arkansas;

After the reading of a telegram from
George E. Greene, president of the New
York State League, pledging considerably
more than 100,000 majority for McKinley
and Hobart, Hon. A. E. Cum m ings of
lowa, member of the Republican Na
tional Committee and representing that
organization, was introduced to deliver a
message from his associates. In the
present campaign, he Mid, the National
Committee would lean upon the strong
arm of the league. He evoked laughter
with applause by his "protest against the
Pharisaical sanctimony of the Bryans, the
Altgelds, the Peffers, the Joneses, which as
sumed to nave cornered all human virtue
in a trust and placed the prodigy of the
Platte in the position of dispenser
of dividends." He characterized them as
"bucoiic blusterers, sterilizing the earth
with their fears and bluffing the panic
stricken public in an attempt to secure
control of the Government."
After reviewing the demands made by
the Democratic and Populist platforms
Mr. Cummings said he had sometimes
thought that "if the Goddess of Liberty
which adorns and embellishes the silver
dollar knew what crimes are being at
tempted in her name, her cheeks would
burn with shame until the silver was as
hot as the silver which burned the hands
of Judas Iscariot." His closing declara
tion that the tariff had ceased to be a
means of raising revenue only, it had be
come the cornerstone of the Nation, was
received with enthusiastic cheering.
W. R. Payne of Illinois offered a resolu
tion that commercial travelers' Republican
clubs be admitted to the league upon the
same terms as college clubs are now ad
mitted. This was referred to the com
mittee on resolutions.
Mrs. J. Ellen Foster addressed the con
vention briefly from the text "That which
a party sows that shall it also reap." The
lesson was that the Democratic party
having sown the wind, it was now reaping
the whirlwind.
The last speaker of the afternoon was
Congressman J.T. McClearyof Minnesota.
Mr. McCleary brought a greeting from the
old north State that its vote this year
would be eiven by an increased majority
to McKinley and Hobart. His speech was
an argument, illustrated by experience in
the history of the United States, to show
that gold and silver will not circulate side
by side, except at their true commercial
ratio; that bimetallism, as defined by the
advocates of free coinage of silver, at
any other ratio is a delusion and a snare.
At the close of Mr. McCleary's speech
the convention adjourned until 10 o'clock
to-morrow.
The several committees met imme
diately after adjournment without trans
icting any business and adjourned until
to-raorrow. The tight over the Presidency
look on several new phases to-day. Mr.
Conaway. the lowa candidate, to-night
withdrew from the race.and his delegation
iÂ« said to be solid for Gordon. An under
standing between the Woo<'mansee and
McAlpin mana.-ers is rurr ed, by the
terms of which, after two cr ' nree baliots,
the votes of the weaker canu .ate are to
be thrown to the other.

MOONLIGHT COACHING.
Interesting History of Captain
Wainwright's Duke of
York Hat
MRS. HOBART'S TINT COLTS.
E aborate Preparations for To-Day 's
Paper Chaseâ A "Scrub" Game
of Polo.
DEL MONTE, Cal., Aug. 25.âBurlin
game reigns supreme here, and it is a dull
and uninteresting reign â no life, no jol
lity, no anything. Just the maddening
monotony of the stale and unprofitable.
The women gather in little knots and
listlessly discuss â nothing. The men
stroll about and with most gratifying suc
cess facially express the boredom they ex
perience.
The most edifying thing to the stranger
is Captain Wainwright's Duke of York
bat, the first of its kind on this coast,
probably in America, imported especially
for this occasion. His Highness the
Prince oi Wales (God blesa him) and his
Lordship the Duke of York never attend
a meet or appear on the turf unless cov
ered, with one. Its history is a subject
that may be safely relied upon to afford
interest for several hours.
Then there are the incidents of that
mild little shoe-throwing disturbance that
the uninitiated persist in terming a scan
dal. They still discuss that with bated
breath and the parental vindication of
outraged dignity. "There are maggots in
the soup and no stability behind the bar"
is the only thing Del Monte has had to
laugh at for weeks.
Everybody looks joyfully for the paper
chase underlined for to-morrow. Consul
Artsimovitch, the originator of the paper
chase on this coast, is here, and has helped
get up the sport. Captain A. F. Wain
wright has laid out the course through the
mountains south of the hotel, a country
studded with most picture sque scenery.
Miss Warburton, V. Artsimovitch, Mrs.
Crooks, Mrs. Neave, J. F. J. Archibald, R.
M. Tobin and Captain A. F. Wainwright
are to be the "hares," and they promise a
merry-chase for those who will participate
in the sport.
Mrs. Hobart's wonderful pair of tiny
drag colts â a bay and a white â are greatly
admired. She drives them harnessed to
her "spidsr," and manages the reins
gracefully and deftly. The colts were
especially exported from Norway by Mr.
Hobart at a cost of $10,000.
The arrival of the Hobart stable on
Monday afternoon was quite the most
interesting event of the day. Nineteen
horses and some fourteen turnouts, in
cluding coaches, drags, carts, etc.,
went past the hotel, forming a most im
posing and not an unpicturesquo pro
cession.
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst has as her guests
here: Dr. William Pepper, a celebrated
Philadelphia surgeon and Mrs. Pepper,
William Pepper, Jr., B. Franklin Pepper,
0. H. P. Pepper and Miss Apperson. The
party went off picnicking this morning and
enjoyed an elaborate collation under the
eiant oaks.
Mr. Richard Tobin gave a moonlight
coaching party last evening. They took
the famous seventeen-mile drive, and on
their return had supper at the club-house.
Mr. Tobin's guests were Mrs. Alexander,
the Misses (Jelia and Beatrice Tobin, Misa
McCormack, Mrs. Caroline J. Lawuon,
Francis Francis and E. J. Tobin.
When it was announced last night and
this morning that the polo games scheduled
for to-day had been postponed owing to
the non-arrival of many of the players,
the disappointment was intense. It was,
therefore, arranged tnat a "scrub" game
should be played. The decision was hailed
with delight. Even a short-handed con
test, in which but three men play on a
side, is infinitely better than no game
these times.. The Del Monte visitors, to
gether with a number of people from
Monterey and vicinity, formed quite an
audience by the time the play was called
at 3 o'clock.
Tne players who wore the white were
W. 8. Hobart, Joseph Tobin Jr., and John
Lawson. The bearers of the red were
Richard M. Tobin, Charles A. Baldwin
and Cecil Tobin. Edwin Tobin acted as
referee. The game was won by the latter
side, mainly because of the good work of
Mr. Baldwin and the excellent manner in
which he and "Dick" Tobin played
together. The play was a great improve
ment over that of last year, there being
little fouling, although Mr. Hobart lost a
coal through a foul play. There was no
off-side play scored either. Although
there were two young playersâ Joseph
Tobin and Cecil Tobinâ the contest was a
most scientific one. The grounds, too.
were in much better condition than last
year, although still too soft to permit of
fast play or long drives.
The game was divided into three pe
riods of twelve minutes each, which is
eight minutes off the periods prescribed in
the rules. Whf-n the referee threw the
ball upon the field the reds secured an im
mediate advantage. The team work of
"Dick" Tobin and Baldwin was at once
apparent. Tobin rushed the ball into red
territory and the prospects for a goal were
bright, when Hobart secured the sphere.
Witn the assistance of Lawson he got it
into the center of the field, but the whites
were so hard pressed that Hobart knocked
the ball from the field. Baldwin secured
tne new ball and made a long run with it
to within twenty feet of the reds' goal.
After spirited play, in which white tried
to shut iiim off, Baldwin knocked the first
goal. The spectators were evidently im
partial and applauded vigorously, wnile
the contestants changed ponies.
During the second period Lawson rode
a white pony that seemed to know the
game as well as its rider. Perhaps it was
the inspiration derived from his steed, but
distinctively this was Lawson 's period.
He got the ball when it was deep in reds'
territory ard a goal seemed certain for his
opponents. By good work he forced it the
entire length of the field and scored the
only point gained by the whites during
the contest "Dick" Tobin and Baldwin
each scored one for the reds before the
twelve minutes elapsed.
The whites played desperately during
the final period in their endeavors to
overcome the lead of their opponents.
With fresh ponies between their knees,
they kept the bali in red territory almost
all the time. The leaders, however, re
sisted valiantly and skillfully. Hobart,
by two brilliant plays cot ihe ball and
scored. In doing so he fouled Balwin and
the goal was disallowed. Baldwin then
got the ball and sent it clear of the bunch
of struggling players. With the as
sistance of his contreres it was carried to
the reds' goal, and there Baldwin scored
the last point of the game, the score at
the finish standing 4 to 1 in favor of the
reds.
A few San Franciscans watched the play
from the ground, but most of tnem were
members of one of the driving parties or
reviewed the incidents of the came from
one of the vehicles.
On the Baldwin coach were Mr. Mills
and his sister Miss Florence Mills, Mr.
and Mrs. Alexander and Mr. and Mrs.
Charles A. Baldwin. Mr. and Mrs. Ho
bart had with them on their drag Miss Ju
liette Williams, Miss itodgers, Captain
Wainwright, Harry Jerome and young
Bruguiere. The Tobin party filled two
carts, and besides the Misses Tcbin there
were Csesare Poma and Francis Francis.
Among the arrivals this evening were:
W. P. Scott, JoseDh Tobin, Cyril R. Tobin,
E. A. Brackenbridge. E. E. Bracken bridge,
E. A. Wilkie, Miss Loughborough, F. J.
Carolan, Mrs. A. M. Easton, Joseph Grant,
Miss Mary Crocker, Miis Jennie Crocker,
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lux, E. M. Green way.
A concert was given by Cassasa's band
of forty 'musicians to-r.ight. The band
stand and the entire grounds of the hotel
were illuminated, making the place a glit
tering bower or beauty. The musicians'
stand, nung with ivy and other greenery
and partially concealed by potted palms
and ferns, was made bright by many in
candescent lamps, tneir gleams flushing
and quivering as the swaying foliage
moved in the evening breeze. The trees
and plants throughout were hung with
Chinese lanterns of varied hues. The soft
light filtered through the branches to the
ground, casting vague, serpentine shad
ows on the soft carpet of grass.

game. Over 200 stand of arms were taken
from peraons entering the park, and as a
result broods of young iquail and grouse
are flourishing. Bear, deer, lynx and fox
are not abundant, but if hunters can be
kept out, will soon multiply.
Colonel Young recommends that the
park be surveyed and its boundaries
clearly defined.
FIRE WIPES OUT A TOWN
Ontonagon, Mich., Presents a
Scene of Desolation and
Abject Horror.
Two Thousand People Are Homeless
and Without Food and
Shelter.
GREEN BAY, Wis., Aug. 25.âOntona
gon, Mich., was wiped out by fire to-day.
Telegraphic communication, which has
been cut off since 4 o'clock this afternoon,
was made with this city at & late hour to
night. The fire has left absolutely noth
ing of the town, and the scene is one of
abject horror. Two thousand people who
were comfortably housed Tuesday morning
are now homeless and without food or
shelter.
A message received from the Mayor of
Ontonagon at 12:45 a. m. this (Wednesday)
mornine by the Mayor of Green Bay ,
asked for assistance, saying they want
tents and food for 1500 people. The ruin
involves the extensive lumber and box
manufacturing factory of the Diamond
Match Company, an establishment alone
worth upwards of $1,000,000 and reported
to carry about $500,000 of insurance on
lumber and plant.
To-day's catastrophe began with the
small fires in the swamp just south of
town, to which no attention was paid, as
they were not considered dangerous; but
this morning the wind freshened to a
gale from the south, the swamp
fires were driven into the lumber
piles in close proximity and before effec
tive defense could be made the flames were
beyond control and driving straight for
the village at a rate so rapid that nothing
was thought of but the salvation of human
lives. In response to appeals the railroad
companies sent all available engines and
cars.
At 4 o'clock this afternoon the operators
in the telegraph offices were driven from
the keys, and, as that office was centrally
locate.l, there can be no doubt that the
entire town was wiped out. The loss is
well covered by insurance, and some com
panies, notably the Mechanics of Milwau
kee, are supposed to be very heavy losers.
Great forest fires are reported" in the
vicinity of Trout Creek, and the mills of
the Trout Creek Lumber Company with
40,000,000 feet of lumber were reported in
great danner and could only be saved by a
change in the wind.
That occurred about sundown to-night,
and light showers have fallen. Nothing
has been heard from Trout Creek since,
and it is believed the piace is safe.
Tne Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
Railway transported the homeless people
to Rockland in box cars, where they were
given shelter.
The loss will aggregate several million
dollars and it is doubtful if the mills
destroyed will ever be rebuilt, as nearly
all the pine in tnat country has been cut.
The town has or had a system of water
works, but it appears to have become dis
abled early and wat, of little use in fight
ing the fire. Many of the people lost all
they possessed by the fire.
IRONWOOD. Mich.. Aug. 25.âIron
wood is completely surrounded by forest
fires. Many houses on the outskirts of
the city have already been damaged and
the fires are gaining ground rapialy. A
high wind is blowing and the whole city is
enveloped in dense smoke. The fire de
partment and evejy av.-iilable man are
fighting the flames, but with poor success.
No rain nas fallen here for six weeks and
every thing is as dry as tinder and falls
an easy prey to the flames.
SONS OF THE SOIL
INVADE EL CAJON,
State Farmers' Institute
Opens With a Large
Attendance.
LEARNED MEN PRESENT
Scientific Dissertations Upon
Topics Affecting Fruit-
Growers.
HOW TO GET BEST RETURNS.
Improvements of the Home and Ad
vancement for Each Little
Hmlet.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 25.â The State
Farmers' Institute opened at El Cajon this
morning with a large attendance. Pro
fessor A. J. Cook of Pomona College,
Claremont; Professor E. J. Wickson of
the University of California, Berkeley;
C. H. Sessions, president of the Southern
California Dairymen's Association, and
Professor W. R. Shaw of Stanford Uni
versity were present.
The address of welcome was delivered
by W, H. Somers of El Cajon. Professor
E. J. Wickson of Berkeley responded and
expressed great pleasure at the kind re
ception accorded tbe visitors and at the
opportunity given to see the valley fa
mous for its raisins. He believed all
farmers should strive to attend the insti
tute. It was the purpose of the university
to lead toward a higher education in hor
ticultural lines. The university did every
thing possible to educate the people, and
its work had been rapid under Professor
Cook's efforts. The regents wished the
farmers to present their views, and he
came inquiring what it (the university)
could do for tbe interests of the State.
G. M. Hawley of El Cajon gave a con
cise paper on "Deciduous Fruits." In
the present depressed condition of the
fruit markets, he said, none but fancy
goods paid. The question how to raise
such fruit he answered by saying, "Irri
gation, cultivation and proper thinning."
For the best results from irrigation and
fertilization, he declared, thorough culti
vation must follow. Analysis showed
that the pits of the peach and apricot con
tained several times the amount of fertil
izer found in like amount of flesh, and by
reducing the number and increasing the
size of the peaches we saved much of the
nitrogen and phosperic acid that would
otherwise be wasted, and at the same time
secured a choice fruit that far outsold the
smaller sizes and that was much more
easily and cheaply packed. The vitality
of the tree was also less injured by grow
ing fewer and better fruits. Experiment
had shown that an overloaded tree would
produce small fruit, make little wood
growth and develop but few fruit buds for
next year's work, while one properly
cared for would produce a vigorous
growth that matured large fruit and de
veloped good bud growth for the next
crop.
Mr. Hawley was followed by Professor
Wickson on "Pruning Deciduous Fruiis."
He said the old method was to prune in
winter, but short days and wet weather
made this expensive. The new method
called for earlier work, as they would fin
ish by November 15. The question, "Is
early pruning dangerous?" was answered
thus: If snmmer irrigated and in vigor
ous growth, go slow, but if leaves have
turned it is safe. Give young trees all
season to grow, but prune bearing trees
eaily. Many prune short for two or three
years and then allow limbs to become
pendant. One grower gets better fruit by
having but few limbs and allowing them
to grow long, but practice should be gov
erned by local conditions."
Mr. Hawley said he thinned Fosters
from one- half to three-quarters as soon as
formed. Mr. Dondore thought he obtained
better fruit by cutting out the center
branches.
Professor Cook believed horticultural
clubs very good, and Harvey Culbertson
was appointed chairman of a committee
to organize the El Cajon Club.
The question-box was one of the in
teresting features of the afternoon. "Eco
nomic Feeding" was asssigned to G. H. A.
Goodwin of Los Angeles, but in his ab
sence the paper was read by C. H. Sessions,
who then followed with his own paper,
"Dairying," which was very interesting.
He has dehorned his herd of about 200
cows and finds the results very satisfactory.
He advises dehorning the cows while dry
to avoid possible danger of feverish milk.
He feeds mixed rations of alfalfa, barley,
bran, corn, beets, etc.
At 3:30 the ladies had the floor, and Mrs.
W. H. Somers offered a resolution that the
equal suffrage amendment to the consti
tution of California be voted upon. The
vote was very satisfactory to the ladies.
The evening session was opened by El
Cajon band, which discoursed sweet music.
Professor Wickson gave a very interesting
talk on "Semi-tropical Contributions to
Civilization," and was followed by M. L.
Ward of Chula Vista on "Village Improve
ment Societies." Mr. Ward made an
earnest plea for the beautifying of the
home and the creation of such homes that
the children who bad crown up in them
woiud long for them when carried else
where by the cares and duties of life.
SA N LUIS KEY'S FIESTA.
Indiana^ Mexicans and Americana Join
in thf Sjiort.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 25.â Large
numbers of people from this city and the
neighboring country witnessed the fiesta
at San Luis Rey Mission to-day. It will
continue to-morrow and next day. Prac
tically the entire Indian population is
there, including big delegations from the
reservations of San Luis Rey, Rincon and
Cuca on the river, Saboba and Aqua Cali
ente. High mass was celebrated with
great pomp in the historic old church,
which is still in fine preservation. The
Rev. Father O'Keefe, keeper of the mis
sion was in charge and sang the mass. A
choir of Spanish young people supplied
tbe music.
Out in tbe courtyard and on the sur
rounding hills the Indians, Mexicans and
Americans joined in athletic sports. The
Mexicans were the best vaqueros, and
broke the spirit of the impetuous bronco
with great dexterity. The Americans ex
celled at other athletic games and sports
which involved strength rather than activ
ity-
The Indians were in their element when
the dances were ordered. They hopped,
ambled, sidled and grimaced with ereat
satisfaction, and went through a number
of legendary dances with a solemnity due
tbe occasion.
One or ,two of the old Indians were
among the converts at the mission when it
was in its glory, and they recitea to
strangers something about the early
history of the place.
Mission San Luis Rey is now in the
bauds of the friars, who have their head
quarters in the monastry at Zacatecas,
Mexico. They have expended consider
able money in renovating the mission,
and have established a school therefor the
training of neophytes in the ministry.
Rev. Father O'Keefe, who is in charge,
was formerly in charge of Mission Santa
Barbara.
To-morrow the sport will take on a
lively turn, as there is talk of a genuine
bull-fight, with a slim and sharp-horned
bull from the pastures of Santa Margarita
on one side, and Jonquin Mendoza, an ex
bull-fiehter from Mexico, on the other.
Many Mexicans have gone up from this
city to see the sport.
Charges Against Chief Brennina.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 25.â Mayor
Carlson has preferred charges against
Chief of Police Brenning, for live years
head of the department, alleging incom
petency, insubordination and neglect of
duty. The charges are based on the re
fusal of the Chief to comply with an order
of Mayor Carlson on the evening of June
26, to disperse an opposition crowd at a
meeting held on the plaza to encourage
support of the water bonds. The matter
will come up before the Police Commis
sioners on Thursday.
PORTLAND ANDUCTION.
Children Stolen by Their Mother from a
Charitable Institution.
PORTLAND, Ob., Aug. 25.â The sequel
to the attempted murder of Mrs. Eliza
beth Marr by Henry Cook, followed oy his
suicide, came up to-day. Four weeks ago
Cook, a saloon-keeper, who was in love
with Mrs. Marr, shot her, but not fatally,
and then killed himself. After the tragedy
Superintendent Gardiner of the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society secured an order from
the County Court giving tbe society the
custody of her two small children. This
was done on tbe ground that neither Mrs.
Marr or her husband were fit persons to
have the children.
The court was to have made the order
permanent to-day, but Superintendent
Gardiner reported that Mrs. Marr had
stolen the children. She with another
woman drove up to the society's house
aud while the matron was engaged they
dragged the children into a buggy. They
drove off and have not beeu seen since.
NEW HOPE'S SENSATION,
Rev. G. H. Frazier Arrested on
a Charge of Attempted
Extortion.
Said to Hive Demanded Money From
Picnickers Who Bombarded His
Church.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 25.â The town
of New Hope has a sensation. The minis
ter of the Methodist church of that town
has been arrested for an attempt to ex
tort money. His trial comes up before
Justice Powell to-morrow, and District
Attorney Nutter was to-day summoned to
conduct the prosecution. A great deal of
interest centers in the trial, as many New
Hope citizens are directly interested in it.
Rev. G. H. Frazier occupies the pulpit
at New Hope every other Sunday, dividing
his time between that town and Isleton in
Sacramento County.
A week ago last Sunday the minister
was conducting services in his New Hope
church, when a party of light-hearted pic
nickers were returning from a watermelon
feast. And as they passed the church
they irreverently threw melon rinds at
the edifice where divine service was in
progress. Their conduct so enraged the
clergyman that he determined to get satis
faction, and of the monetary variety, too.
He ascertained the names of several of the
young men who were in the party and
who had thrown the rindd, and is alleged
to have demanded reparation in the form
of cash, holding above them the threat of
prosecution if they did not produce. It is
said that he obtained small sums from
several of those upon whom he made tbe
demand.
The minister approached, among others,
a young man named Reuben Boon. He
refuscl to pay a cent for his fun, and
swore to a complaint charging the pastor
with an attempt at extortion. The clergy
man is married and has a family.

PELALUMA, Cal., Aug. 25.â The Peta

BAPTISTS MEET
AT TWIN LAKES
Picturesque Spot Where
Are Gathered Many
Churchmen.
ANNUAL SESSION BEGUN
President Hill of Oakland Re
views the Past Year's
Progress.
PLEASED WITH THE RECORD.
Sacrifices and Toils That Have
Benefited Man and Won
Divine Favor.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aug. 25.â The
fifteenth annual convention of the Baptist
church and affiliated organizations was
begun at the association's handsome
church in the picturesque spot known as
Twin Lakes, taking its name from the two
small lakes in the vicinity. Tbe church
and the pretty cottages surrounding it
stand on a broad mesa, surrounded by
little knolls and gulches, with Monterey
Bay at its feet. It is a desirable spot for
residence, and the Baptists, like the Chris
tians that gather at < Jarrield Park every
summer, find tbe pleasure of a summer
outing with the doing of their church
duties.
The convention was called to order at 3
o'clock this afternoon by the president,
-Rev. C. N. Hill. The opening services
and Bible study preceded the appointment
of committees. The committee on im
portant points in the report of the board
is composed of Revs. S. V. Keach,
Vacaville; A. G. Sturvenant, Sacramento;
G. W. Donald, Hanford. The enrollment
committee is composed of Revs. J.
George Gibson, Emmanuel Baptist Church,
San Francisco; T. H. Stephens, Chico; R.
D. Clarke, San Jose.
Tbe evening session was begun with a
praise service attended by a large congre
gation at 7 o'clock. The regular business
of the convention was introduced with the
suggestions offered by President Hill of
Oakland, who presented his report, of
which this is the substance :
I wish first of all to congratulate the con
vention on the auspicious beginning of this
anniversary. The attendance even now at the
opening is gratifyingly large. Not only the
nearer churches, but also some of the most dis
tant ones are represented. Already a tone of
earnest prayer and purpose has characterized
the meeting.
I congratulate you upon the favorable cir
cumstances under which we meet. The in
formal appearance of the Twin Lakes resort in
general and the evident careful and thought
ful preparation and adornment of this audi
torium promise to add greatly to our com
fort and profit during the sessions of the con
vention.
I congratulate you upon the record of another
year's work for man and God. It is a record
that shall not be wholly disclosed until the
books are opened at the last day. We may be
sure that the record will tell of many sacri
fices and toils aud successes. God's blessing
has rested upon our labors in a conspicuous
manner.
By way of suggestion, permit me to remind
you that the interest of a meeting like this de
pends upon the interest of the individual del
egates. The statement needs no special enforce
ment. Delegates who have come here have
accepted responsibilities. The responsibilities
involve the presence of the delegates at the
sessions; their prayers and their hearty co-op
eration. The profit of the convention depends
upon its order and dignity.
We represent 10,000 Baptists; our conven
tions, in a sense. 4,000,000 Baptists of the
United States. What we do is done in the eyes
of the world; therefore, we should guard well
our words and consider well every action here
taken. Still further, the efficiency of the con
vention meeting depends upon every one tak
ing an interest in all the departments of work
represented in these anniversaries. Let it be
our purpose lo make this convention gathering
one of spiritual power. I ask your help in
this. I trust we shall ask great things in great
faith.
Rev. I. D. Wood preached the annual
sermon, which was listened to with pro
found attention.
NEW TO-DAY.

CAMP O'RYAN'S
PIRATES FIVE.
Cadet Buccaneers Beaten by
Guards in Bloodless
Conflict.
GLEN ELLEN PASTIMES.
A Military Bastile Kept Crowded
With Mock Prisoners
of War.
NOTED VISITORS ENTERTAINED

Before Blazing Fires at
Night.
GLEN ELLEN, Cal., Aug. 25.â This has
been another perfect day in camp O'Ryan,
where the League of the Cross Cadets are
temporarily quartered in their tented
town. The morning dawned upon a beau
tiful scene, with the boys already out
under the spell of snare drums, all bustle
and excitement in preparation for another
round of the good things this delightful
spot assures, for genial sunshine, fragrant
air, Bwimming in the creek, monstrous
appetites, long walks together with all
kinds of wild larks and amusement.
The arrival of Dr. A. P. Mulligan, sur
ceon of the regiment, was a sign for the
cadets to be prepared for a close inspec
tion. Early this morning the doctor was
in camp and among the tents with an eye
upon their sanitary condition. He re
ported that he was very agreeably sur
prised at tbe neatness and order displayed
on every hand and the nice attention to
detail apparent in every tent In only
one regard was there any fault to be found,
and that was tbe neglect of an army regu
lation requiring the tents to be ooened in
the back as well as in front for a free
passage of air from morning till night.
But tbe cadets had their blankets in triple
folds, according to regulations, their straw
beds carefully confined to the exact limit,
and elsewhere had every thing clean as a
new dollar.
Company H had its tents prettily deco
rated with bunting strung along the front
and with Japanese lanterns hanging be
tween, while from stacks of sabers along
the street were drawn strings of lanterns.
In the center of the gaily decorated tents
the boys from St. Brendan's Parish on
Rincon Hill, San Francisco, suspended a
large banner bearing the inscription j
"Camp Yorke, Company C, the Pride of j
the South Bide." Not to be outdone, j
Company C of St. Patrick's Parish came
well supplied with decorative materials,
with the result that its tents, adjoining
those of Company H, appeared resplendent
in red, white and blue drapings mingled
with festoons of green bunting. Directly
opposite is a Mission company, the mem
bers of which, with an artistic turn, nar!e
their canvas-houses beautiful witb gar
lands of riparia vines and bunches of
graceful grasses from the stream near by.
Captain Filgate had a small flagpole j
erected in front of his headquarters, and
the red Greek cross on a white ground
nutters over the hospital, while a large
American flag is streaming from the main
flagstaff in the square. So the camp has a
decidedly attractive appearance that
bespeaks a special interest on the part of
the cadets.
Among the visitors in camp to-day were
R. X. Ryan, general paÂ«senger agent of
the San Francisco and North Pacific Rail
way, and Father White of Bonoma. Mr.
Ryan entertained a party of friends at
dinner in the Mervyn hotel. Among his
quests were Rev. James McDonald, chap
lain of the camp, Dr. A. P. Mulligan, Cap
tain Filgate and some of tbe staff officers.
It was given out that Dr. Mulligan would
have to appoint an assistant surgeon with
the rank of captain, which he has enjoyed
since he became surgeon of the regiment.
With this change, the doctor's rank will
be elevated to that of major.
Early this morning the tent of the
"fiye pirates," containing Sergeant Can
ning, J. McAuliffe, J. Hughes and others,
gave forth sounds that were pronounced
hurtful to the peace and midnight dignity
of the little community. 80 the "five
pirates" were attacked in their lair by the
guard, who were taken by surprise to find
their entrance blocked by the points of
five murderous-looking, gleaming sabers.
An unbloody battle ensued, and the guard
at last victoriously marched five crest
fallen prisoners to the guardhouse. After
breakfast there was considerable merri
ment over fire pirates cleaning the camp
by way of punishment.
Evidently the boys were rested yester
day, for they cut up endless antics all
night, with the usual result â a full guard-
Louse. â¢
T. Dwyer, T. MclnGrny and Privates
Allen and Griffin of Company G, Sergeant
Hynes, Gorporal Telfer and two privates
of Company H were taken from their tents
and incarcerated. The prisoners filled the
guardhouse and there was an overflow
meeting outside. They essayed an attack
upon the guard, but were repulsed, and
then dashed past the lines. An exciting
pursuit and capture followed, ana now
there is a record of disorderly conduct
against a dozen cadets with the re
marks, "Pursued and captured and
punished." Still it is all great fun for the
boys.
Swimming in the romantic pool lost
none of its gentle allurements to-day for
the cadets, although it was accompanied
in many instances by the temporary loss
of clothes and the consequent unpleasant
ness of being drummed into camp in
bathing suits by all tbe cadets.
The camp never looked better than to
night, when several visitors from the I
neighboring summer resorts were present
around a blazing fire in the square.
Cadets in fatigue uniform formed half the
circle, while the remaining space was re
served for ladies and tueir escorts. A
really enjoyable entertainment was given
by the young warriors. The programme
was as follows:
Musical solos, Privates J. McDonald and
J. Egan of Company B; sentimental sons,
Private William Ryan. Company H; reci
tation. Captain D. J. McCarthy, Company
E; song, "Old Kentucky Home," Glee
Club, Company C; vocal soios, Corporal

song and chorus, "The Lifeboat,'' Glee
Club nf Company H; song, Corporal Wil
liam Kelly, Company H; song, Lieuten
ant David A. Barry, Company B; song,
Lieutenant C. Kennedy of staff.
The detail for the guard for twelve
hours, commencing at 7:30 o'clock this
evening, is an follows: Officer of the day,
Captain D. J. McCarthy ; officer of the
guard, Lieutenant J. Regan; sergeant of
the guard, Sergeant Robert Canning; cor
poral of the guard ; Corporal Frank Telfer;

McKI NLEY THEIR CHOICE.
fj old Democrats at Lot Anaelei Same
Their Delegates.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 25.â The
gold Democrats of this city, following the
example of those in the northern metropo
lis, have begun a campaign of active oppo
sition. A well-attended meeting was neld
to-day at which delegates were selected to
attend the National Democratic Gold
Convention, which meets at Indianapolis
next month.
The meeting was called to order this
afternoon in the office of Will A. Harris, a
prominent Democrat. Mr. Harris pre
sided, and C. D. Willard, secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce, was chosen secre
tary. Mr. Harris made a brief address, in
which he referred to the necessity of all
true Democrats taking steps against the
financial plank of the Chicaero platform
and urged all to rally in support of the
gold standard, which lie regarded as one
of the fundamental principles of the party.
He predicted grave disaster in the case of
success of free silver.
Short talks were made by others, and the
followingdelegatesto the Indianapolis con
vention were chosen: W. A. Harris. C. D.
Willard, W. J. Hunsaker, fl. W. O'Mel
veney, Captain J. T. Lawler, George
Pooley, John J. Byrne and I. H. Johnson.
It was evident from the general tone of
the gathering that those present regarded
tne situation now confronting the country
as most serious and that the defeat of free
silver should be accomplished. The gen
tlemen were all evidently in favor of sup
porting McKinley, and several so expressed
themselves. The gentlemen organized
under the name of the Sound-money
Democratic Club of Los Angeles.
Oakdale Republicans Organise.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 25.â A McKin
ley Club was formed in Oakdale to-night.
That place is in the midst of a red-hot
silver section, but a number of the people
from the country about turned out in an
enthusiastic gathering for the purpose of
organizing the club.
ROUND VALLEY'S TRAGEDY
Seven Men Formed the Party of
Lynchers That Hanged
Littlefield.
How Joe Gregory's Boasts Were
Fulfilled in the "Dark and
Bloody Ground."
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Aug. 25.-If
Joe Gregory did not assist in the murder
of Vaquero "Jack" Littlefield, on Red
I Mountain last September, he is destined to
1 martyrdom as a victim of circumstances.
. The network of evidence that is closing
j about tbe subject of "King" George E.
i White is one that he can scarcely break
j through. Gregory, if innocent, was so
unfortunate as to have had lynching "on
the brain," and whenever he gave way to
his peculiar mania he indulged his com
panions in advice as the proper manner in
which Littlefield and Yes Palmer should
be removed from earth. Gregory was
always intent on "doing up" his enemies,
I but not in fair combat, man to man.
The first witness this morning was
Henry Smith Hoaglin, who testified that
he had met Gregory in the latter part of
June, 1895, on the road between Covelo
and the Indian reservation. Gregory pro
posed that Hoaglin go into partnership
with him for the purpose of "doing up'
lattlefield and Yes Palmer. He wanted
some man who would stand by him "in
case of a showdown," he said. Gregory
told the witness that at tbe time that he
j (Gregory) haa cut Ltittlefi eld he would
have killed bim but that the knife closed
on his hand.
Frank Hanover, who has been employed
since the Van Horn and Crow case in look
ing up evidence for the prosecution, de
clared that he had heard Gregory say that
he would kill Littlefield. Gregory wanted
to organize a mob to kill both Littlefield
and Yes Palmer, and he wanted Hanover
to help.
He gave a list of those who were willing
to help, saying that Baylis Van Horn,
Tom Haydon and John Crow were ready,
and adding that George White and others
would stand between him and all harm,
and that he could depend on George Wb"*
to tbe amount of $5000. Gregory's step
father, Williamson, his mother and sister
had also been heard to express the opinion
that Littlefield ought to be hanged.
On redirect examination by Deputy
Attorne5 r -General Post, Henover related a
conversation that he had with Gregory on
the 20th of August, 1895. He asked
Gregory why he had gone to Mad River,
and Gregory replied: "I guess it ain't any
ofyour business." Then Gregory Baid:
"We were going to get up a mob to hang
Littleneld and Palmer. They are camped
on Red Mountain Creek, and I thought I
would sound you to see how you felt about
the matter." Gregory said all he wanted
was one other man to do the shooting and
the balance to prove an alibi.
Hanover testified that he was at Tom
Haydon's house at daylight on the morn
ing of September 27 (the day of the lynch
ing) and met there Cain, Buck Lacock,
Tonp Haydon, the Fleetwood boys and J.
M. Vinton. Laycock went after Gregory
and Radcliffe, and Hanover saw the three
returning to Haydon's house, after which
Hanover left for Bald Mountain.
The witness was questioned about tbe
Sherman murder at Covelo several weeks
ago, and whether or not Sherman had
been summoned to testify on behalf of the
people. He did not know.
Dr. Goyer was called shortly after the
opening of the court this afternoon. He
said that he had been summoned to at
tend J. M. Vinton on September 26, 1895.
"Bill" Espy had undertaken to escort him
to Haydou'fl house, where Vinton was,
but having procured a bottle of whisky
Espy became intoxicated, lost the way
and fell asleep in Cricket Gulch.
Goyer arrived at his destination an hour
after sunset and found Crow, Lacock,
Vinton and Cain at the house. Tom Hay
don and Gregory came about 10 o'clock.
Baylis Van Horn came later. The crowd
left the house about 3 o'clock, armed with
Winchester rifles, and returned about"s:so.
Lacock returned later.
William Shores, a brother of Mrs. Yin
! ton, testified that as he was approaching
Haydqn's house on the afternoon of Sep
tember 27, when about a quarter or half a
mile from the house he observed Mrs.
Haydon out with a spyglass, looking in
the direction of Wylackie range. He also
observed seven men on horseback riding
around a hill west from Haydon's house.
He asked Mrs. Haydon what she was
looking at, and she replied that she was
looking to see if Littleneld had taken the
cattle out of the Wylackie corral. Vinton
gave him the names of the seven men.
They were the Van Horn brothers, La
cock, Haydon. Gregory, Radcliffe and
Crow. Later Vinton said, when asked
why they did not get back, that "there
might be some mischief or trouble," or
something like that, and that they were
going to arrest "Jack" Littleneld for
shooting him. Haydou and Lacock re
turned about dusk.
"Bill" Espy, the bacchanalian shepherd,
was next called. He stated that on the
afternoon of September 27 be saw three
men on horseback traveling at a fast gait
up the Wylackie trail. He watched them
go out of sight around the Wylackie
corral, toward the McPherson place. He
was in company with Frank Potter at the
time and Potter remarked that they were
traveling pretty fast for a warm day.
Espy said he had heard Vinton say that
at the first saloon he caught Littlefield in
in Covelo he would take a double-barreled
shotgun and blow his brains out.
A recess until to-morrow morning was
taken, with Espy BtiH on the stand.-

WOODLAND, Cal., Aug. 25.â The di
rectors of tbe Woodland Fair Association
are well pleased with the result of the
first day's meeting. When the stringency
of the times is considered it is remarkable
that there was such a good attendance. If
the interest should be sustained through
out the week the people of Woodland will
have good cause for congratulation, and
the directors will feel particularly grati
fied. Al Leach, who has charge of the
auction poolbox, is enthusiastic over the
outlook. He says his books show that
the first day's business in Woodland was
more than double that of the first day at
any other meeting in the circuit.
On Thursday a number of State officials
and members of the State Board of Agri
culture will be guests of the association.
Governor Budd was invited, but he is at
Lake Tahoe and will not be at home in
time to accept. His office will be repre
sented by Private Secretary Edward Mc-
Cabe. Adjutant-General Barrett will also
be of the party. Of the directors of trie
State Agricultural Association it is expect
ed that Messrs. Matthews, Wilson and
Mackey will be present. Secretary Smith
will also come if he can spare the time
from his official duties.
The weather was very pleasant to-day.
A light breeze from the south prevailed,
The attendance was very much larger
than yesterday.
In the first event, the 2 :17 trot, three in
five, for a purse of $500, there were seven
starters. Margaret Worth was scratched
at the last moment on account of lame
ness. The seven starters are considered
the pick of their class now on the circuit.
Fool-selling was lively and Gazelle, the
pride of the Winship <fc Keating string,
was established as a hot favorite at the
rate of $10 to $8 for the field. The start
was very tedious and Starter McNair im
posed a fine of $10 on Thomas Smith and
threatened the others before he succeeded
in getting them away. George Washing
ton and Atheena had two lengths the
worst of the send-off. Thornhill and
Humboldt Maid cut out tbe work and led
to the quarter, with the favorite in third
position.
Atheena challenged the leaders and
passed them near the half. Humboldt
Maid was not to be easily shaken off.
She fought it out with Atheena to the
wire, but could not last and the Palo Alto
entry won by a length under a strong puli.
Gazelle made a spurt on the homestretch,
but could get no better position than third.
Time, 2:15^.
The result of this heat did not frighten
the backers of Gazelle. She became a
more pronounced favorite than ever.
Pools sold at the rate of $10 for Gazelle
to $5 for the field. At these odds money
poured into the poolbox. The horses got
the word on the second attempt. Atheena
and Humboldt Maid set the pace to the
quarter, with Homeward and Gazelle a
length behind. Homeward passed the
Maid and carried the leader to the half.
Homeward and Gazelle closed up around
the turn and the lour entered the home
stretch well bunched. Gazelle proved too
speedy for her company and passed under
the wire a length in the lead, with Atheena
second and Homeward third. Time.
2:15%.
There was no betting after the second
neat and Gazelle won with ease.
When the side-wheelers of the 2:20 class
were called out Frank L was a prohibitive
favorite, selling for $15 to $5 for the field.
Tbe horses got away on the third attempt.
Palatina and Jennie Me led to the quarter,
the favorite five or six lengths back.
Near the half Palatina broke and Jennie
Me led around the upper turn. Frank L
came with a rush and half way down the
stretch had Jennie Me at his mercy. He
won as he pleased by a length, the others
finis! ing in the following order: Jennie
Me, Prince Bismarck, Dictatus, Adele,
Beachwood and PetalUma. Time, 2:15.
The second and third heats were devoid
of interest, because the result was never
in doubt. Frank L won hands down.
The betting on tbe mile handicap run
ning race was lively. Pools sold at $10 for
the field, $5 for Warrago and $5 for Sea
Spray. There was a long delay in starting.
When the horses got the word they were
well bunched. It was a not race from
start to finish. Two Cheers won in I:43J^.

BALTIMORE, Ma, Aug. 25.â The last Cleve

exciting. Tebe.au'* double, an infield out and

For the home team Clark led off with a single
and reached third on a sacrifice and a single.
Most of the 11,000 spectators were on their
leet, encouraging the champions and trying to
rattle Cuppy. When Burkett started for Jen
nines' fly the crowd broke over the ropes and
made an ineffectual attempt to block him.

sixth inning and gave Cleveland but two
hits. Jim Corbett, the pugilist, sat on the

The Canada Wins Easily.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Aug. 25. â The Chicago
yacht Vencedor was unmercifully beaten
by the Canada in the first of tbe series of
yacht races for the international yachting
championship of the lakes, off Toledo, to
day. The Dominion yacht in a li^ht
breeze, which just enabled her to cover the
triangular 24-knot course within the re
quired five and a half hours' time limit,
beat the Vencedor 17 mm. 59 sec. actual
time and 22:44 corrected time.
The Vencedor at no time stood a chance
in the light air with her small sailspread,
but whenever tbe wind increased she
showed considerable speed, and her ad
mirers still have hopes of her in a breeze.
A tremendous crowd of spectators on
the decks of a hundred or more excursion
steamers witnessed to-day's race, and the
Canada received an ovation when she
slipped across tbe finish line just before
the expiration of the limit agreed to under
the rules.
Three seconds after the starting gun
was fired at 11:00:03 the Vencedor crossec
the line, 1:15 ahead of the Canada, which
easily made up the difference in the light
wind, and ten minutes later was at the
Chicago boat's quarter. After blanketing
the Vencedor the Fife boat passed ahead
to the windward.
At 2:05 the Canada finished* the first
round, and at 2:13:30 the Vencedor fol
lowed. On this leg the Cliioago boat did
better, ana began to overhaul tbe Canada.
When the next mark was reached the
Vencedor had gained 25 seconds, their
time of turning being: Canada 2:39:40,
Vencedor 2:48:25.
The wind again fell light, and the Ca
nada, sÂ» usual, began to. draw away from
the Vencedor and gained 5 minutes and 35
seconds on her before she turned the sec
ond mark at 3:29:30 and Veudecor at
3:43:50.
The Canada pointed up well in the last
lee, and dropped the Vencedor steadily
and crossed the line a winner at 4:19:08,
the Vencedor not finishing until 4:37:07.
STOCKTON OFFERS
CHEER FOR ALL
Admission Day Guests Need
Not Hunger or Go
Thirsty.
GOOD FARE, BUT CHEAP.
Fifty Cents a Meal the Limit
to Be Assessed Native
Sons.
REDUCED RAILROAD RATES.
Ten Bands From San Francisco Will
Attendâ A Parade Three
Miles Long.
STOCKTON, Cax., Aug. 25.â One of the
most important meetings yet held by the
Native Sons' committee was that of to
night. Two delegations from the churches
appeared before the committee with refer
ence to providing meals for the visitors.
The Central M. Â£. Church had agreed to
accommodate 500 of the visitors, and its
representatives wanted to Jcnow what was
expected of them. They said that they
had at first intended to only give ham,
eggs, coffee, rolls and melons for break
fast, but had finally determined to serve
all fresh meats for the morning repeat.
The other two meals served at the church
on the 9th will be more elaborate.
The church people said that they in
tended to supply an abundance of food to
every one, and it was agreed that 50 cents
a meal would be the limit of cost to each
who went to the church to eat. It was
agreed that if any of the San Francisco or
other parlors not quartered in hotels de
sired to make contracts for providing for
tbe members less rates would be given.
The representatives of the First Baptist
Church made similar arrangements. The
Christian Church and the First Presby
terian Church, as previously stated in The
Call, have arranged to feed a large num
ber.
The committee decided to-night to boy
cott any place that would not furnish an
excellent meal to the visitor! for 50 cents.
It was stated that one fashionable board
ing-house intended to charge more, and a
protest was raised at once.
Never in the history of Admission day
celebrations has a committee at tne place
where the festivities are to bn held labored
more assiduously for the welfare of the
visiting natives and their friends than
have the general and executive commit
tees tha| have charge of tbe coming cele
bration. Thnyare working night and day^
to secure proper accommodations for the
thousands who will be here on the
Btn, 9th and 10th of September, and it will
not be the fault of the members if the
visitors are not better provided for than
ever before in the history of Admission
day celebrations.
Hugh R. McNoble and Gus G. Grant ar
rived on tbe night train from San Fran
cisco, whither they went yesterday in the
interest of the coming celebration. Theirs
were the most important reports of the
evening. McNoble, as chairman of the
transportation committee, reported that
the officials of the Southern Pacific Com
pany had guaranteed a two-thirds rate
from every station in California where a
parlor of Native Sons was coming to the
celebration. This applies to points north
of Fresno and to such other stations as
the committee may request that the rate
be made from.
Chairman Grant of the water carnival
committee submitted a report that was
received with -the most enthusiasm. He
said that he had interviewed a number of
yachtsmen about tbe bay, and that Cap
tain Charles C. Bloom of one of the clubs
had promised that fifteen small yachts
would be here to participate in the water
carnival. This agreement was made on
condition that the carnival committee
would send a tug to meet the yachts at
Antioch and tow them to Stockton. The
yacht-owners have agreed to decorate
their crafts with bunting and lanterns.
They will be here on the afternoon of the
Bth of September, in time to participate in
all of the festivities.
Another San Franciscan has promised
that fifteen steam and gasoline launches
will be on hand, and the owners of the
launches bave agreed that they will assist
in towing tbe floats that are to form the
parade On the water on the night of Sep
tember 9th. The steamer T. C. Walker
has been chartered by Mission Parlor, and
will be beautifully "lighted with electric
lamps.
Grant reported that ten bands from San
Francisco had agreed to take part in the
water carnival. Wheat barges will be
provided for them and the parlors that
they will accompany.
These barges will be brilliantly lighted,
and will be features of the great pageants
on the water.
Company F of San Francisco has prom
ised to conic here at least eighty strong
and brine its gatllng guns, to be exhibited
during the parade.
Grand Marshal Nutter announced to
night that the parade would start promptly
at 10:15 o'clock and that there would not
be a moment's delay in getting tbe great
body of paraders in motion. The line of
march is three miles in length.

Jianch Employe Disappear*.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 25.â Henry
Scheifer, who has been employed on the
James Flood ranch near Alma, has mys
teriously disappeared. Yesterday morn
ing he started out after a load of gravel,

was made for him. About a mile from the
ranch the team was found tied to a fence,
but there was no trace of Scheifer. He
had been employed on the Flood place for
several years. He was sober and indus

SWINGING TO McKINLEY,
Ex-Secretary Foster's Brother
Predicts Victory for the
Protectionist
Returns From a Tour of Bastern
States Confident of Republican
Success.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 25. â George
Foster of Coronado, a brother of ex-Secre
tary of State John W. Foster, has returned
from an Eastern trip and is enthusiastic
over the prospects for McKinley's election.
"Everywhere that I went in the East,"
said Mr. Foster to-day, "the Republicans
were exceedingly hopeful, and where one
Republican deserts the cause of sound
money two Democrats are gained. My
brother in Indiana, who is familiar with
the politics of that State, believes it will
certainly give a majority for McKinley.
In Chicago the Democrats are terribly
divided, and. will vote for McKinley rather
than for Bryan.
"The National Republican headquarters
in Chicago is one of the busiest places
there, and an amazing amount of work is
being done. I am personally acquainted
with Messrs. Heath and Dawes of the
committee, and was a frequent caller at
headquarters while in Chicago. They
told me that the outlook grew brighter
every day, as a result of the enlighten
ment of the masses on the money ques
tion, and from personal observation I can
corroborate their statements.
"There is no doubt about Michigan;
Ohio will be solid and lowa and Nebraska
are Republican. The party is doing work
tnat will tell. Documents are beine sent
out by the ton, and everybody is w : de
awake. Very favorable reports nave been
received at the National headquarters
from Wisconsin and Minnesota. The
Germans are solidly for McKinley. This
is conceded by everybody. The senti
ment generally is a great deal better than
it was at first. People who thought they
were in favor of free coinage are changing
their minds. I have come back much en
couraged and will do all I can to stir
things up for McKinley."
Work of the Grand Jury.
The United States Grand Jury held a brief
session yesterday. An indictment was re
turned against Timothy Lynch charged with
having illicit opium in his possession. The
cases against Dick Williams and Louie Quong
were also considered, but do definite action
taken.

SAN JOSE PIONEER
COMMITS SUICIDE,
Capitalist Peter 0. Minor
Brings Death Upon
Himself.
BULLET ENDS HIS PAIN.
Had Been in Feeble Health and
a Prey to Worry for
Years.
LOST BY A FRIEND'S CRIME.
Judgment Late y Given Against Him
as Bondsman for Defaulter
Cordell.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Ang. 25.â Peter O.
Minor, a pioneer resident of this city,
committed suicide early this morning by
shooting himself through the head in a
closet at his residence, at the corner of
Julian and Market streets. The suicide
was premeditated. His body was discov
ered about 7 o'clock by Garrett Minor, a
son, lying in a pool of blood. Death had
been instantaneous. It is believed that he
killed himself about 3 o'clock, as several
of the family were awakened by some
noise at that time. The following note
was found in his vest pocket :
To the Coroner of Santa Clara County, Cat ; In
tense and constant pain with worry have
made life a burden to me, and I have volun
tarily committed suicide.
Please have no inquest or autopsy. Yours,
P. O. MIHOB.
August 24, 1896.
P. O. Minor was a native of Virginia,
aged 74 years. He came to California in
1849, and in the following year settled in
this city. He engaged in the practice of
law. The deceased was interested in the
building of the Santa Clara and First
street railways and several other enter*
prises and amassed quite a fortune. Dar
ing the last few yeare, however, he has
Deen involved in financial troubles. A
few days ago he was compelled to mort
gage some property on First street foi
$8000.
Yesterday a remittitur vai received
from the Supreme Court of the State af
firming a judgment obtained against him
in the Superior Court for $1400 as a bonds
man of Thomas Cordell. a notary publio
who fled to South America after forging
several mortgages. It is believed that this
preyed upon his mind and led him to take
his life. Minor had also Buffered from
rheumatism.
The suicide's estate is valued at $75,000.
A widow and three children survive him.
The children are Garrett and Elliot Minor
and Mrs. Mary Eeed.
An inquest was held this afternoon and
a verdict of suicide rendered.
Arraigned for Belling Tfiteated Court.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 25.â Bridget Sul
livan and D. G. Sullivan, who conduot a
dairy on the King road, were arraigned be
fore' Justice Goss to-day on a charge of
having disposed of nine cows that were
suffering with tuberculosis. The cattle
had been condemned by Veterinary Spen
cer. The Sullivans will he tried on Sep
tember 12. They were released on $300
bail each. The case will be watched with"
interest by dairymen, as some of tne lat
ter dispute the right of the inspector to
condemn and kill their cows affected with
tuberculosis^
Xevada Mine* Attached.
CARSON, Nev., Aug. 25.â Attachment
papers were issued yesterday against the
Union Mill and Mining Company, owning
the Mexican, Morgan, San Diego, Vivian
and other mills on Carson River. The
amount involved is $10,000.LIVE WORK ON
THE MOTHER LODE,
Senator E. C. Voorhees Tells
of the Activity in Ama
dor and Caiaveras.
ALL WORKING HARD.
About 2000 Miners and 700
Stamps Busy on the Lode
in Amador Alone.
THE WORK ON THE GWIN MINE
Arrangements for a Forty-Stamp Mil 1 .
The Miners for Silver, Gold
and McKinley.
Senator E. C. Voorhees of Amador
County, whose mining enterprises at Sut
ter Creek and in Caiaveras have made him
widely known in mining circles, is at the
Palace. Senator Voorhees has recently
Senator E. C . Voorhes, Who Tells of the Increased Work on the Great
Mother Lode.
{Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
been visiting Cripple Creek and other
mining centers, and has returned home to
renew operations with greater energy and
with increased forces of men.
He thinks Amador and Caiaveras coun
ties have mining resources that are in
every way striking and little short of
phenomenal. One enormous advantage
over many other regions, he points out, is
that mining may be carried on every day
in the year. He says there is nnusnal ac
tivity on the mother lode not only in the
vicinity of Sutter Creek, but elsewhere
along the lode.
"There is almost double the activity
that I have seen in many years," he said
last night. "I estimate that there are now
fully 2000 miners at work in Amador
County. This is a good many for a small
county like Amador. There is more in
quiry, too, for claims than for years.
* 'Any amount of prospecting is going
on. Many small properties are being
worked, and the mines are in a general
wÂ»y opening out well. The Exploration
Company of London is doins a good deal
ofworic. It will take the company three
years to sink their shaft. The county is
paying for labor and supplies between
$75,000 and $100,000 a month. The work
extends principally for eleven miles on
the mother lode. A good deal of moneyjis
being taken out of a large number of
properties.
"In Aiuadcr County there are nearly
300 stamps running. These stamps will
average two and a half tons of ore each.
ManyÂ°of them crush four tons each a day,
but putting it at the average of two and
a half tons there are at least 700 tons of
ore crushed daily.
"A good many Colorado men have re
can tly come in and gone to work at vari
ous places on the mother lode. There is
k sprinkling of mci., too, from other parts
of the West. The advantage of that region
is that the miners can work eyery day in
the year. The miners have their families
with them. They are all happy and con
tented."
Senator Voorhees is one of the owners
oi the rioted Gwin mine, on the mother
lode, in Caiaveras. Askea about this, he
said the work was now being pushed to
the 1400 level, the men sinking as fast as
possible.
"There is a pood deal of ore insight," he
said; "It is low jrrade. but altogether the
mine in looking exceedingly well. We are
working between forty and fifty men, and
are grading and getting ready" to erect a i
forty stamp mill. The Union Iron Works :
â tab the contract for the milL
"Ir: regard to politics up on the mother J
lode," continued Mr. Voorhees, "the peo- !
s>le are lor silver, though they arÂ« digging ]
for goiil. They are for both gold and
silver. By saying they are for silver, I
mean they are for it in the way that is |
best for the country. They want free â 
Bilver when it can be had on a feasible |
basis, so that no injury will be worked to ,
o>e State or Natiou. For this reason 1 |
look for tue miners to support the Republi
can ticket this year, and so far as I am able
to jud#e they will do so. I think Califor
forniawill this fall give a safe majority
for Mr. McKinley.
"In Anialor and Caiaveras we have
been thinking, however, more about put- :
ting men at work than anything else. We J
are all pretty well satisfied with the way j
things are working out." j
Mr. voorhees will probably leave for his |
home at Butter Cre<Â»k to-day.
BEATEN AND ROBBED.
Experience of A.' BoyÂ«en, an Oakland
Storekeeper, In a Saloon on Sac
ramento and Kearny.
Edward Place, a recent arrival from Los
Angeles, was booke 1 at the City Prison
yesterday by Detectives Gibson and Wren
on the charge of robbery.
On the night of July 22 A. Boysen, who
lives at Lonn station. Alameda County,
and has a store at 223 Eighth street, Oak
land, was in a saloon in the neighborhood
of Sacramento and Kearny streets. Two
men, one tall and the other short, took
him into a rear room, knocked him down
anJ robbed him of a very valuable gold
watch and all the money he had in his
pockets. They beat and kicked him so
brutally that he is still confined to his
bed.
The case was reported to the police and
Gibson and Wren were put on it. They
had a mÂ«a>:er description of the two men
to worK with, but they succeeded in arrest
ing PI ace on Monday, and when searched
at the prison Boysen's watch was found in
his possession. "Place positively refused
to give any explanation of how he pro
cured the watch, and was accordingly
charged with the robbery yesterday. He
answers the description of the short man
of the two, and Gibson and Wren say they
will be able to connect him with the rob
bery. They are now looking for his com
panion.
POLK PAID THE BILL.
The Architect Settled the Del Monte
Claim and Did Not Produce
Hia Books.
Willis Polk, the architect, appeared in
Justice Groezinger's Court yesterday in
the suit of J. J. Raver against himself, but
he was not required to produce his books,
as he bad been ordered by the Justice, be
cause he paid the judgment of $60 obtained
by the collector for the Del Monte Hotel
management, and thus put the claim at
rest.
The justice was angry, however, and in
timated that in future he would require
prompt attendance or send the delinquent
to jail.
Collecter Raver stated that other claims
against the architect would be presented
shortly and that he might again insist on
an inspection of the books.
PICTORIAL HISTORY OF SAN
FRANCISCO.
A Remarkable Edition to Be Issued |
Next Saturday by the Wasp.
The Wasp will on Saturday next pub
lish one of the most remarkable numbers !
ever issued by a weekly journal. It will '
be a pictorial history of San Francisco, !
containing sixty pages of splendid half- !
tone engravings, which show at a glance
the progress San Francisco has made,
architecturally and otherwise, since pio- >
neer days. The Wasp has purchased the j
copyright for the rarest collection of old â 
photographs of early San Francisco in
| existence. These are all reproduced faith
! fully in the special number to be issued j
j next Saturday. They are printed upon I
| the finest and most expensive paper and
j beautifully bound in rod, green and gold. !
; All the exciting scenes of Vigilante days j
; are depicted â the shooting of James King i
! of William; the surrender of Casey ant' j
i Cora by the authorities, their execution
I and that of other offenders.
The pictorial contrasts presented in the
Wasp's special number are most inter-st
ing. For example, Market street as it i
j looked before the Palace Hotel was built |
I and New Montgomery street cut through \
I is contrasted with that great thorough- j
I lare as it looks today. All the famous I
old landmarks are thus reproduced ana j
the great buildings that have been erected
upon their sites, are portrayed.
Among others The Call buildine tow- j
j ering to a height ol sixteen stories is de- '
| picted. Interesting articles by well- i
known writers add to the value of the j
Wasp's number. George E. Barnes dis- !
courses of theatrical affairs in early days
in Maguire's old Jenny Lind Theater and
in the old California Theater, pictures
jof tfhich are given. An illustrated article
on tbe old Volunteer Fire Department, I
. with a contrast of the engints of fifty
I years ago and those of to-day, will be read !
j Wlth much interest by veteran firemen |
| and their successors.
1 Among other notable reproductions of i
old photographs in the Wasp's special
number are the launch of the Camanche !
I in 1864. the tomb of Thomas Starr King
after the obsequies in March, 1864. old
' St. Ignatius Church in 1860, the plaza in
, 1849, the first photograph of Sau Francisco
; ever taken, showing the (own as it then
stood between Washington and Ciay
streets, with ships anchored on Sansome
street where houses now stand. The
\V asp's special number will make a sensa
tion among pioneers and native sons, and
is sure to be prized by those who want a
perfect pictorial record of the progress of
| the City in fifty years. (

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
FOR pkbsidekt-
WILLIAH McKINLET, of Ohio
FOB VICF-PREBIDEXTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EI-KCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896. "
McKinley's speeches are vote-winners
every time.
Free trade may be an issue no longer,
but protection is.
There are no true Republicans except
those who stand for harmony, unity and
party discipline. #
McKinley holds his tariff record up be
fore the eyes of the people, but Bryan has
hid his up his sleeve.
Kicking is a poor way to establish har
mony in a party, but it sometimes helps a
little to kick a kicker.
Revive industry and increase consump
tion and there will no longer be com
plaints of over-production.
As a matter of fact everybody knows
that more work and more wages is what
the people of this country need.
The Republican kicker helps the ene
mies of the Republican party, but even
they scorn to regard him as a friend.
Since the gold men call themselves
National Democracy the Eryanites will
have to wear the title of sectional Democ
racy.
Democracy insists that the tariff is not
an issue, but just the same all Democrats
get out of the way when they see it
coming.
The money question for the American
trorkingman is bound up with that of the
tariff. They are inseparable and cannot
be divided.
It is hard to tell what sort of Secretary
of the Interior Francis will be, but the
Cabinet certainly lost weight when it lost
Eoke Smith.
Jf cKinley in talking to the people points
the way to prosperity for both labor and
capital, but the Bryanites point only to a
conflict between them.
The Democratic idea is to have the farm
in America and the factory in England,
while the Republican plan is to have both
the farm and the factory in this country.
A comparison of the speeches of McKin
ley with those of Bryan will convince any
intelligent voter that the former is the
better fitted to be President of the United
States.
Every dollar paid for goods of foreign
manufacture that could have been made
at home is a dollar taken from American
labor and a dollar less in the home market
for farm products.
The gold Democrats should by all means
renominate Cleveland. There is no chance
of a third term in it, and be has done
enough for them to justify such a mark of
their esteem and confidence.
The one duty before Republicans at tbis
time is to give a cordial support to the
nominees of the party on the local as well
as on the National ticket, and no man is a
genuine Republican who refuses to do so.
California will surely cast her yote for
McKinley if loyal Republicans succeed in
organizing the party for effective work,
but it will go five-ninths for Sewall and
four-ninths for Watson if the kickers have
their way.
Americans consume eighteen times as
much of the products of American farms
as the foreign consumers, and it is surely
a matter of plain common-sense that tbe
farmer should protect his big market at
home instead of running after the smaller
one across the ocean.
Liberal Democrats and independents of
progressive minds may support the woman
suffrage amendment as a matter of indi
vidual approval of a good cause, but Re
publicans should Bupport it as an evidence
of party fealty. Tne Republican party
declares for it, and the pledge mast be
kept by Republican voters.
On the rock of International bimetal
lism the free-silver wave has spent its
force, and it is on that rock the Republi
can party builds its pledge to the people
to restore silver to its former position as a
money metal, without injury to any trade
or industry, by means of an agreement
with the leading nations of the world.
The evidence given in the trial of Joe
Gregory at Weaverville for the killing of
Jack Littlefield is confirming almost every
detail of the fearful story of Round Valley
as told by Thk Cat.j, correspondent, who
first investigated and made it public.
Rarely has a free press proved itselt more
useful to justice than in this case, for it
was not until the facts had been published
and public sentiment had been aroused
that the courts were able to act with vigor
for the punishment of the wrongdoers
UNITE AND WIN.
The cause of patriotism, protection and
prosperity goes safely, and rapidly on to
victory in the East. Even such States as
New York, New Jersey and Indiana, which
are oftener Democratic than Republican,
are safe for McKinley this year. Democ
racy in those States has no Hope ; it has
not even a brag. Why shoulcHt be differ
ent in California? Why is it that Democ
racy and Populism have been fused
together for a time by the burning belief
that they can carry this State for Bryan
ism, free trade and disaster?
There is but one answer to that question,
but one explanation of the extraordinary
fact that while New Jersey is assured for
McKinley and Hobart, California is suffi
ciently doubtful to encourage the ambi
tions and rouse the energies of Democrats
and Populists. The Republican party in
New Jersey is harmonious, united, solid.
All members are working together for vic
tory, and all the chronic growlers and
complainers have been long; since silenced
by the voices of tba loyal. It is different
in California. A few men who from their
positions in the party ought to be most
earnest in promoting unity of action are
either leading factions themselves or are
giving countenance and favor to those who
do so. Even newspapers professing to
represent Republicanism are filled with
sneers and slurs at the party instead of
words of encouragement, arguments
for the enemy instead of support for
friends, and with a hundred evidences of a
desire to see the party beaten rather than
to see it triumph under its present leader
ship.
California is by reason of the great im
portance of protection to its manifold in
dustries a natural supporter of the Repub
lican party. All classes of our people
profited much by the McKinley tariff and
all have lost much by the Gorman tariff.
There is, therefore, a strong sentiment in
favor of the Republican party in this cam
paign and there can be no doubt that a
majority of the voters of the State are for
McKinley and Hobart and for Congress
men who will vote for protection. If they
are united and vote together they will
sweep the' State, carrying ' not only the
National and Congressional tickets -but
the legislative ticket that will assure the
election of a Republican Senator. If
they are not united, however, the fusion
ticket will win and California will be mis
represented in Congress by men who will
sacrifice her industries and her welfare for
the sake of their theories of free trade and
silver monometallism.
No earnest Republican can regard the
present situation with indifference. The
persistent efforts of those who are trying
to divide the party into conflicting factions
endanger the success of protection in the
State and may endanger it in the Nation,
There is cot the slightest justification for
the attacks of these factious wonla-be
bosses. The Republican party in Cali
fornia was never more ably jed than at
present, and the leaders were never more
free from personal self-seeking. From
Chairman McLaughlin of the State Com
mittee to the loyal workers in the counties
and the Assembly districts there is not a
man in the forefront of the fight who
does not merit the full support of the rank
and tile of the party. That they should
have it goes without saying. The issue
before Republicans in California is simply
this: Shall we divide and lose or unite
and win?
THE REAL AND THE BOGUS.
It is not at all strange that Republican
speakers should make a distinction be
tween Bryanism and Democracy. No well
informed man would speak of the Chicago
platform as a Democratic declaration of
principles nor of Bryan as a Democrat. In
this connection it might be suggested that
if Andrew Jackson were alive he would be
strongly inclined to hang Bryan and every
delegate who voted for him in the conven
tion for stealing the livery of the Demo
cratic party to serve Populism in.
From its organization down to and
through the administration of Buchanan
the Democratic party was opposed to
paper money of all kinds and forms, and
to silver. The few Democrats who were
in Congress during the war voted almost
to the man against authorizing the Gov
ernment to issue greenbacks. They in
sisted that gold and only gold should be
employed by the Nation for a circulating
money medium. As late as 1876 the De
mocracy in National convention â the con
vention that nominated Tilden â refused
to favor the free coinage of silver. The
opposition to the white metal was so great,
indeed, that a proposition to fix the ratio
at the actual commercial values of the
metals was voted down by more than two
thirds majority.
From 1801, when Jefferson was Presi
dent, down to the Chicago convention in
1896 the leaders of the Democratic party
have stood for gold money and so declared
in conventions. It is true that the Na
tional conventions between 1876 and 1896
declared for the largest possible use of
silver as a circulating money medium, but
it was always implied at least that the
gold dollar should not only be the unit of
value but that silver dollars should be in
directly redeemable in gold. The Demo
cratic party has never stood for bimetal
lism in the sense of the employment of
silver on its own merits. The Demo
cratic party has never believed that it is
possible to have more than one standard
of value, and it has invariably advocated
gold as the proper material for the
standard. No man can be a consistent
Democrat and favor the coinage of silver
dollars other than on account of the Gov
ernment, and then only in such volume
as can be redeemed in gold.
Republican speakers, therefore, who
make a distinction between Bryanism and
Democracy know what they are talking
about. The Chicago convention was cap
tured by the worst foes of the Democratic
party â that is to say, by the Populists.
The chief end of the Democracy, in the
South more especially, has been to
vote down or count out Populist candi
dates. Bryan and his following are not
Democrats at all. They may have been
at one time, but they now have no more
rigbt to call themselves Democrats than a
Christian has to claim that he is a fol
lower of Jesus Christ after he has em
braced Mohammedanism. Let people and
parties be called by their right names.
Bryanism is boeus Democracy.
SECTIONALISM.
The country was in danger in 1881 and
the musket was resorted to. The country
is in danger in 1896 and the ballot must be
resorted to. In 1861 the Southern section
of the country defied the authority of the
constitution of the Nation. In 1896 the
Altgeldsand the Bryans are defying the
Jaws of commerce and business ethics.
Had the South succeeded in the war which
it inaugurated in 1861 the whole country
would have perished, nor would the Soutn
have escaped the general wreck and ruin.
If Bryanism prevails in 1898 suspicion and
hesitation will clog every channel of com
merce and industry. The application of
Bryan's economic theories in the conduct
of tne affairs of the Nation would be as
fatal to the business well-being of the
people as recognition of the doctrine of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 189fi.
secession would be fatal to the stability of
the federation of States.
The methods of Mr. Bryan to inaugu
rate a business and political revolution
differ widely from those employed by the
South, but his ultimate purpose does not
differ so much from what the Confederate
leaders had in mind, and Mr. Bryan talks
very much as they did. When the Con
federate armies inarched Northward it
was to "invade the enemy's country."
When Mr. Bryan started Eastward the
other day he said he was going to "invade
the enemy's country." The chieftains of
the Confederacy proclaimed it to be their
purpose to establish a republic indepen
dent of the United States. Mr. Bryan, by
his platform, proclaims the sectional doc
trine of "interior States" supremacy. Jef
ferson Davis ana tis lieutenants declared
that the North was hostile to the South.
Bryan and his lieutenants declare that
the East is hostile to the West. Davis
said the North oppressed the South, and
Bryan says the East is oppressing the
West. Davis called upon the South to
defend itself against the North, and Bryan
calls upon the West to defend itself
against the East. Has the mantle of Jef
ferson Davis fallen upon the shoulders of
William Jennings Bryan? Anyway,
Bryan talks in 1896 very much as Davis
talked in 186 L
REED'S WORDS OF WISDOM.
There was a grand rally of Republicans
at Old Orchard, Me., yesterday and Con
gressman Reed was the principal speaker.
Mr. Reed is as great as he is a conserva
tive statesman. He is a logical reasoner
and a political economist who reasons
from cause to effect above party lines,
hence what Mr. Reed says is always wortn
remembering and safe to act upon.
In his speech yesterday he said panics
come upon the business world because
people go into rash speculation and over
reach themselves. But the storm does not
come until the people begin to lose confi
dence in the ability of one another to
m^et their liabilities, than comes disaster
upon disaster and community after com
munity goes down in bankruptcy. Mr.
Reed is not so sure that me panic of 1893
would not have come anyway, no matter
what party the administration represented. .
The people had been sowing the wind for a
good while and they had to reap the
whirlwind.
But when trouble came the bu?iness in
terests of the country found the Govern
ment in the hands of an administration
that was wholly incompetent to direct the
power and influence of the Nation in the
direction of the channels of business to
strengthen the weak places. Had a strong
and capable man been directing the pub
lic's affairs a way to relieve the intense
pressure would have been found, and
what proved to be one of the most disas
trous business panics in recent years
would have spent its force before very
great damage had been done.
Mr. Reed does not lay all the blame for
the cause of the hard times of 1893, which
sjtill linger in the highways of commerce
and industries, upon the Democratic
party, but he does blame it for failing to
grasp the situation and avert the
j worst of tne troubles. But it is the his
tory of the Democratic party to be un
equal to great emergencies, chiefly because
its economic policy and theories of govern
ment are uniformly at variance with good
business ser.se and the experience of trade
and commerce, and for this reason even
the ablest and wisest of Democrats snould
not be trusted with the management of
the affairs of the Nution, and if the ablest
statesmen of that party are unequal to
such a task how utterly incompetent and
unsafe the Bryans of the party must be.
TO FARMERS AND MECHANICS.
Last Monday was a great day in Canton.
A large delegation of mechanics and an
otner of farmers paid their respects to
Major McKinley. Of course he made a
speech â two speeches, and it may De said
he covered the entire philosophy of Re
publican principles when he told the me
chanics that "No matter what kind of
money, we cannot get it without work â
whether it is poor or good, gold or silver.
We cannot get one dollar unless we have
employment forour hands and our heads,"
and told the farmers: "You cannot help
the farmer by more coinage of silver. He
can only be helped by more consumers of
his products."
The United States cannot help the enor
mous increase in farm products in South
America and Russia, nor can the United
States control the price of farm products
in the consumption markets of Europe.
Great and powerful competition faces the
wage-earner and farmer of tbis country,
but it is foreign and beyond our juris
diction.
Europe does not want our farm products
at higher prices than is asked by Argen
tina and Russia, but Europe does want to
continue to supply our markets with man
ufactured goods. That is the situation as
regards our wage-earners and our farmers.
Mr. McKinley says the only way to relieve
our wage-earners and farmers is to have a
tariff high enough to protect our indus
tries so that they may give American labor
pienty of work at good wages. When that
is done the demand for food supplies will
maintain home markets for the farmer's
products at better prices than he can get
in Europe. *
Had Major McKinley talked for a month
or written a dozen books on the needs of
the people he could not have made it
clearer what this country needs to insure
prosperity in all lines of business and oc
cupations.
The farmer needs better prices for his
produce, but there is no way under the
shining sun by which he can secure them
other than by selling his products to our
own people. The people, however, cannot
buy because they have no money, and they
have no money because they can get no
work to earn money.
Now, what is the common-sense thing to
do under such circumstances? Why,
start up the industries, give the people
work at good wages. Then they would
have plenty of money to buy and the
farmer would have a permanent market
for his products at good prices.
The question of how to induce, keep and
maintain prosperity in tbe United States
is not much of a problem. Just protect
our wage-earners from destructive foreign
competition and they will quickly estab*
lish good markets for tbe farmer. It is a
very simple proposition.
BRYANISM AND DEPRESSION.
Further investigations of the free-trade
question, fully published in to-day's Call,
show that tbe evils of the Wilson bill were
apparent long ago and that tne Democrats
purposely dodee the tariff issue because
they are ashamed of their record on the
Wilson bill.
It is shown that so long ago as 1894 the
threats of a reign of Clevelandism run
rampant on free trade had an injurious
effect upon business, that wages depre
ciated, factories closed and farmers suf
fered.
Do what they will, the Democratic ghost
of industrial ruin will not down. The
more their orators cry for free silver as a
panacea the more intensely tbe people
ask, "What has become of your free-trade
panacea and why are you ashamed of it?"
All over the country the Democratic
silence on the tariff issue is an evidence
of guilt. They are trying to divert the
issue, but the people refuse to be longer
deceived.
"THE WEEKLY CALL."
There is a large class of people who, by
reason of remoteness of location or tbe
Jack of mail facilities, prefer a weekly
rather than a daily paper. To these The
Weekly Call will be found a welcome
visitor, containing, as it does, not only the
most important telegraphic news which
appears in the daily, but many features
prepared especially for it. The new
Weekly has been greatly improved and its
subscription list, which has more than
doubled within the past year, is increasing
at a growing ratio. The number which
appears to-day is especially interesting.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
CANDIDATE SEWALL.
Shall Hk Pkevent a Union of thk Reform
Forces ?
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
The platform on which Bryan stands not only
demands the free coinage of B'lver, but as ex
plicitly demands the abolition of the National
banks as banks of issue and the issuance by
the Government only of all money, paper
money as well aÂ« gold and silver money.
These are the words of that platform: "Con
gress alone has the power to coin or issue
money," and these words follow: "That
power cannot be delegated to corporations or
individuals." That is pure and absolute
Populism. Bourke Cockran, a gold Democrat,
and John Sherman, a gold Republican, and all
the McKinley newspapers of the whole
country denounce Bryan as a Populist. He
does not deny it. Then, too, be is as much the
candidate of the Populists as he is of the new
Democracy. The old Democracy, the Cleve
land Democracy, repudiate him and his plat
form and they nave called a National conven
tion to nominate a gold candidate. It is un
derstood that they will nominate McKinley.
In this grave emergency, this National crisis,
when the line of battle is drawn between gold
men, National bankers and the corporate
monopolies on tb>a one side and on the other
side tne common people and the industrial
interests demand a National money issued by
the Government only, the free coinage of
silver and the ownership by the Government
of the great corporate monopolies, instead of
having the Government owned and operated
by the corporations, as it is now under Cleve
land, as it was under Harrison, as it will be
under Hannaâ ln this grave crisis, I say, the
straight Populists of the country are con
fronted with Arthur Sewall, a national banker
and a rank corporationist, who is the candi
date for the Vice-Presidency on the Democratic
ticket and who, by reason ol our laws, is in a
position to force a division of the vote for
Bryau if straight Populists refuse to vote for
him (Sewall). The question which comes
home to me, as It must to every other straight
Populist from Maine to California, and the
question which cannot be avoided, which
must be answered, is this: Shall Arthur Sewall
prevent a union of the reform forces and
thereby certainly deieat Bryau and all he
stands for â the demand for a National money,
for the free coinage of silver, the overthrow of
the gold men, the National banks, and the
Government ownership of the great monop
oliesâand thus secure the certain election of
McKinley, the rule of gold and national banks
and the oppression ot the corporations for four
years more, il not for another generation?
That is the question which straight Popu
lists must decide if Arthur Sewall finally
lails to prove himself a genuine patriot by re
fusing to force his candidacy upon resentful
Populists, instead of retiring from the ticket
and removing tae one cause for friction and
just resentment between the reform forces. I
iusist that as straight Populists we cannot
Ignore this question. It is impossible to escape
it. We must answer it. ln California
we cannot' vote for Bryan and Watson
alone, as the law stands, without casting
more than half of our votes for McKin
ley and Hobart. As the election may be close,
auy one of common sense can see that the nine
electoral votes of California, lost to Bryan,
would be almost certain to give McKinley
votes enough to elect him, for nine votes in
the Electoral College, where 227 votes will de
cide who shall be President, will be very
likely to turn the scale against Bryan and for
McKinley if straight Populists cast only four
voies for Bryan, instead of nine, by refusing
to vote for the justly obnoxious Bewail also.
If we did not have to vote for Presidential
electors; if the Populist doctrine that we
should vote directly for the Presidential can
didates by name were the law, then we could
cast all our votes for Bryan and Watson by
name, and all of our votes would be effective;
but cannot do so now, for the law prevents it.
As there seems to be much confusion and
misapprehension in the public mind as to the
fact that a straight Populist vote for Bryan
and Watson alone is less than half a vote for
Bryan in effect, and more than half a vote tor
McKinley, it is jforth while to try to make the
fact plain and clear to all straight Populists, att
well as to straight Democrats who prefer to
vote for Sewah alone, because he is the regular
Democratic candidate and is not a Populist.
No one of ordinary sense will seriously claim
that it the Democrats should put up nine
straight Bryan and bewail elector* there would
be any chance whatever of electing them. It
is no doubt true that nine straight Bryan and
Watson electors would poll a much larger vote
than the Sewali electors, but ouly sanguine
Populists could hope to elect them.
Again : It Democrats vote for Bryan and Sew
all electors alone these five electors are certain
to be defeated, since no Populiut would vote for
them. The same result will follow if Populists
vote for Bryan and Watson alone, since they
could not expect enough Democrats to vote for
them to insure their election.
On the other hand, there is no possibility of
defeating the combined vote of both Demo
crats and Populists, each voting for the can*
didates of the other in sell-defense and to se
cure the election of their joint candidate,
Bryan, for the Presidency. Straight Demo
crats and straight Populists must remember
that the same electors vote for both President
and Vice- President, and they must vote for
the whole nine of them if they wish to secure
nine votes for Bryan. Now, if the straight
Democrats and straight Populists allow party
feeling to govern them and ' refuse to vote for
the whole nine electors, five for Sewall and
four for Watson, howevar disagreeable it may
be, they are certain to lose tae whole nine
votes for Bryan, and as certain to give them to
McKinley and Hobart. There is no escape
from this trying dilemma. Vote for the whole
nine of then and Brran will get all of them
and the Vice-Preside"nts â¢will divide them, five
for one and four for the other.
The foregoing analysis of the effect of voting'
for straight candidates has been given on the
supposition that Sewall will persist in ataying
on the Democratic ticket; but it seems in
credible that he will do so, since neither him
self nor Watson can be elected, for neither can
hope to receive 227 votes, the number neces
sary to elect. Patriotic Democrats should
unite in demanding his retirement from the
ticket, as an act of good faith to nine-tenths
of the Populists in the National Convention
who voted for the nomination of Bryan, as
well as an act of patriotism due the country.
as I have already pointed out, there are two
great forces struggling for the mastery in this
Presidential election, the money power and
the corporate monopolies on the one side, and
on the other side the common people and the
industrial interests. A shorter and simpler
way of stating the same fact would be to say
that on the one side we find only McKinley
Democrats and McKinley Republicans; on the
other side are the Bryan Democrats, Bryan
Republicans and Bryan Populists. These are
the several allies in this contest. They are in
league on both sides for a cause common to
each side. When they have won or lost they
can return to their old party affiliations if
they find that by co doincr they can best serve
their country. Joseph Asbtjey JOHNSON.

A SILVER-MINER'S VIEWS.
Questions Addressed to Those Who Are Op-
posed to the Free Coinage of Silver.
Editor Call: In your issue of the 19th inst.
are some "pertinent conundrums" asked by S.
N. Wyckoff under the title of "Silver Market,"
Bryanites, etc.; and as it seems to be
"fashionable" to ask questions, allow me, as
a crazy miner of thirty-five years' experience,
to ask Mr. WyckoS or some of his kind of people :
Why is it that the Mexican dollar, which
contains more pure silver than the American
dollar and which can be bought for 50 cents, is
not bought up by the goldbug who hat plenty
of money to spare, have it made into bullion
and sold for 67 cents? There is sorely a
little money in it. Why is It that â¢ crazy
silver-miner who has delved in the "earth and
toiled for years," and who, you say, wants
to tod the people to bring to the surface
an honest silver dollar â why is it that
when he gets it there the honest goldbug
condescends to give him, perhaps, 67 cents
for it, but still Insists on him taking it back an
good as a gold dollar? Who is it that tells us
silver money Is not honeÂ«t money? Who was
it and what was it that destroyed the value of
silver money in the United State*, and why
was it done? Shutting down the mines and
smelters and throwing thousands of honest
toilers who were earning $3 50 a day on the
mercy of the goldbug, who says "Stay there."
Yes, Mr. Wyckoff, we can ask a good many
conundrums, but the facts are the same. The
demonetization oi silver has paralyzed the in
dustries of the country, and if you don't
believe it come and take a look and see for your
self ; the mills and smelters lying idle, rot
ting,which are not worth a dollar and on which
taxes must be paid. It's not Mr. Bryan nor the
abuse of him nor the prate about 16 to 1 that
is going to do us any good.
We -have neither silver enough nor gold
enough for the people's good, but I know you
will not agree with me; but perhaps it's better
to shut up the silver mines, lest a silver miner
should make a dollar, and issue more bonds
for England's gold. Don't you trunk it's a
good idea? Of course you do. Respectfully,
James W. Haas.

SECRETARY BROWN
AND DEMOPOPS,
He Will Decline to Place
the Fused on the
Ticket.
THE LAW WAS VIOLATED
He Will Ask the Attorney-
General for a Written
Opinion. N
ELECTORS MUST BE GROUPED
011 a Podrida Tickets Not Con tern
pla'ed by the Election Law as
It Exists Here.
Secretary of State Brown yesterday
stated to several persons in this City that
he would refuse to place upon the ticket
the names of the fusion Demopoptic-
Cratulistic Presidential electors on the
ground that the election law of California
required the names of the electors to be
arranged alphabetically in groups under
their party designation.
He said that as soon as the Demopops
and Cratulists presented the names to
him he would dictate a letter to the
Attorney-General asking for his opinion
in the matter. Then he took the evening
train for Sacramento.
Attorney-General W. F. Fitzeerald was
seen at his residence last evening by a
representative of The Call. The Attorney-
General was willing to discuss the weather,
the whale bunt, the condition of the
prune crop or any other subject, but he
declined to be interviewed for publication
on the question of whether he had or had
not advised the Secretary of State not to
recognize the fusion electors. He said he
had given the Secretary of State no offi
cial opinion in the matter.
"Was he given to'understand that he
could not officially and legally recognize
the fusion electors, either directly or in
directly from you?" was asked.
"I have not examined the subject and I
am not prepared to give an opinion to any
one," replied the Attorney-General.
"May I inquire if you and tue Secretary
of State had a consultation on the sub
ject?"
"Not a consultation. He told me simply
that he intended to write me a letter ask
ing/me for a written opinion on the sub
ject."
"Has the letter been written?"
"I have not received sucli a letter," re
plied Attorney-General F itzgerald with a
low chuckle, which was the outburst of
several preceding smiles.
"When will you render an opinion on
the subject?" was asked.
"After I receive the letter from the
Secretary of State," said, the Attorney-
General quizzically. "When I have an
opinion on the subject to make public The
Call shall know it," he added.
"Do you know if a precedent has been
established in any other State showing
that fusion electors cannot be legally ac
cepted?"
"As 1 said before, young man, I decline
to be interviewed on this subject," he said,
with a smile as broad as the State at
large.
"But upon what ground did the Secre
tary of Slate make such a statement â "
"Now I lite reporters; they have al
ways treated me all right, but you must
excute me from talking. If I had any in
formation to give out or had prepared an
opinion yon should know it."
Attorney-General Fitzgerald paused re
flectively and then suggested: "Go and
see Brown â but no, he's gone to Sacra
mento, I believe; telephone him â that's
it, telephone Brown. Just say I declined
to be interviewed," said the Attorney-
General with a concluding smile.
Secretary of State Brown was seen in
Sacramento last night immediately after
his arrival there, but positively declined
to be interviewed on the subject.
THE FUSION MEETING.
Matters In Connection With the
Foregrolnar Report.
The general conference committee of
seventeen, consisting of six Democrats, six
Populists and three Silverites, met yester
day morning at the California Hotel,
George W. Baker presiding and M. F.
Tarpey officiating as secretary.
W. H. Alford, chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, named the
following Democrats to act upon t:>e joint
Congressional conference committee: Eu
gene M. Den prey, H. P. Andrews, A.
Caminetti, Woodson Garrard, M. C. Has
sett and Joseph Leirgett.
The Populists appointed one member
from the six Congressional districts, as fol
lows: J. W. Keegan. L. M. Landsborough,
J. M. Moore, A. B. Kinne, E. M. Wardell,
J. S. Dore. In James G. Maguire's dis
trict, the Fourth, no appointment was
made.
The California silver campaign com
mittee appointed the following three mem
bers: Charles D. Lane, W. P. Lawlor and
James P. Edoff.
On the appointment of the committee of
fifteen to constitute the joint Congressional
conference committee, the general confer
ence of seventeen adjourned to meet at
the California Hotel at 10 a. m., Septem
ber 7.
The joint Congressional conference com
mittee then proceeded to organize, ten
members being present.
Eugene N. Deuprey was elected tem
porary chairman and W. P. Lawlor tem
porary secretary.
In so much as the Silver representatives
had no candidate for Congress, and would,
therefore, occupy a comparatively neutral
position, it was decided that the perma
nent officers be selected among their num
ber. Accordingly Cnarl^s D. Lane was
nominated as permanent chairman by
E. M. Wardell, seconded by George w.
Baker. Mr. Lane was elected unanimously.
A. B. Kinne nominated James P. Edoff
for permanent secretary, seconded by E.
M. Wardell, and he was also chosen unan
imously.
The committee will again meet at 2 p. m.
next Monday at the headquarters of the
Silver Campaign Committee, Baldwin
Hotel, each of the parties to notify its
representatives to be there at that date
and time.
McCLASHAN ANGRY.
Declares That He Will Not Resign
to Be Jobbed.
George W. Monteith, Populist candidate
for Congress for the First District, is not
alone in his distrust of the beautiful plan
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1896.
adopted by the DemoDoptic-Cratulists to
have all the candidates for Congress re
sign and to have their places filled by the
joint fusion committee. G. F. McGlashan,
People's party candidate from the Second,
had blood in his eye in the California
Hotel fusion slaughter-bouse before the
meeting of the joint committees yesterday.
He charged Caminetti and Cator with
having conspired to job him in the new
deal by appointing some one else in his
district in case he should resign, and he
swore he would not resign. He named as
his authority ex- Congressman Louttit of
Stockton.
Mr. Caminetti denied the truth of the
suspicion and said something uncompli
mentary concerning Louttit, whereupon
McGlashan flared up and declared that
Louttit was his friend and that he did not
propose to hear him abused behind his
back.
Cator denied the soft impeachment also,
but McGlashan was not appeased and
went away breathing defiance.
STOLZ DEFENDED.
Hit Fellow-Vutohers Vouch for Hli
Reliabilityâ No Intention of De
frauding the Public.
H. F. Stolz wishes to deny having ex
posed diseased meat for sale. He is in
business at 510 Castro street. Tne sale for
which he wrs convicted on Monday was
of a cow for an individual and not for the
public. He states that tie had no desire to
do wrong and had no intention of deceiv
ing the public. He is particularly careful
about his meat and rejects any but first
ciass meats. All the neighborhood recog
nizes his reliability asatirst-olass butcher.
The following statement is self-explana
tory:
San Francisco, Ang. 24. 1896.
We, the undersigned, wholesale butchers of
tbe City of San Francisco, hereby certify that
H. F. Btolz, 510 Castro street, has bought
notiiin<r of uk but the best first-class quality of,
all meats to be had since he has been in busi
ness:
J.G.Johnson & Son, 831 Kearny street; J.
McDermott, 345 Tenth street; George Lewen
berg, 319 Pine street; Charles Rosenburg,
529 CU7 street; Henry Levy, 529 Clay street;
S. Pilverberg, 320 Sansome street; James Hall,
1651 Harrison street; Poly, Hellbron A C 0.,339
Kearny street; Horn & Judge, 504 Kearuy
street; H. Moffat, 233 Kearny street; J.
Schweitzer & Co.
Inspector Davis states that he examined
the premises of H. F. Stolz and found the
meat in question. The heart, liver, etc.,
were hung separate from the carcass. He
has every confidence in the good faith of
Mr. Stolz ana the representation* of the
wholesale dealers.
THE UNDERTAKER
AND HARD TIMES,
He Says There Is Very
Little Money in His
Business.
FUNERALS ARE PLENTY,
But the Surviving Friends
Will Not Pay the
Bills.
RETAIL PRICE OF COFFIN?.
They Are Not High Considering Ex
penses of Funeral Directors
Very Heavy.
The undertakers complain bitterly of
the hara times.
"But how can that be? People keep
dying just the same; they must be buried;
the price of coffins and of graves has not
come down, have they?" is the question
which naturally follows.
"No, certainly not; and the price of
graves has nothing to do with the case
anyhow," said the undertaker. "The fact
is, however, that a funeral is couuted in
among the list o* luxuries after all. People
die and are buried in these as in otner
times, but they or their friends call for
cheaper coffins and fewer carriages. But
that would be all right, too, and prove no
great cause for complaint. The worst of it
is the bill is seldom paid. I know one un
dertaking concern in this City that has
from $30,000 to $40,000 outstanding on its
books, of which it does not expâ¬ct to collect
more than 10 per cent. That's what makes
the hard times with the undertakers."
"Bin even this concern, with a loss of
say $25,000 on $30,000 worth of business, is
probably making money. Your charges
make allowance for a big loss, don't
they?"
"The concern is solvent, to be sure, and
the members live reasonably *ell, but
that is the best that can be said of any
undertaker. None of ibem get rich. I
don't know of a single undertaker who has
got rich in the business. There is one old
house here that perhaps is an exception
to that rule, but it is a fortune that was a
long time accumulatingâ it was the house
and its reputation, rather than the men
now controlling, that has brought the
money. It has almost a monopoly of the
funerals of tne wealthier class of people
who die. The average undertaker has a
'â other precarious time of it.
"There is plenty of work for all to profit
reasonably well if it were equitably dis
tributed ana the bills were paid. For in
etance, there are thirty undertakers in the
City. The death-rate averages 550 a
month. That would give to each under
taker eighteen funerals a month. Borne
there are who have forty and fifty a
month, while others secure but three or
four. Now, one would think that the bill
for the burial of father, mother, sister or
brother would be among the first to be
paid by surviving relatives. The fact is
that the undertaker never expects to col
lect his bill wifhin six month- after the
funeral, for the reason that very, very few
begin to think of paying before that "time.
In the case of estates, wdere the bill goes
to executors or administrators, it is some
times years before the Dill is paid. These
are the things that make the life of the
undertaker unhappy.
"In the meantime," continued the fu
neral director, "we have to pay up prompt
ly every month our bills for carriages to
the livery stable, our coffin bills, our ad
vertisine bills and the wages of our help
all have to be. met promptly when due.
Then there are the horses to be kept etc
Every undertaker has his hearse and dead
wagon and buggy. One concern has three
hearses and two dead wagons. People say
that the price of coffins, the cost of funer
als, is excessive. Considering all things
they are very moderate."
"What is the cost of an average, respect
able funeral?"
"Well, that all depends. The location
of the grave, the number of carnages, etc,
regulate the cost. Man or woman, how
ever, can be very nicely buried for $200.
That is a good average funeral. But where
most of us eet a case of that kind we get a
number where the price is nothing. You
see the undertaker must answer his call
without asking any questions. Like the
doctor he is summoned and must respond
whether there is money in it or not. When
people die they must be buried, you know.
So you see there is more to make the un
dertaker gloomy than the mere funeral
trappings with which he is surrounded."

A fareweU reception was tendered at the
W. C. T. U. headquarters, o.t McAllister
street, yesterday afternoon to Miss Clara
Miss Clara Parrish, the "W". C T. U. Missionary, "Who Leaves
To-Day for Japan.
Parrish, a missionary who will leave for
Japan to-day by the Coptic for a temper
ance crusade around the world.
Miss Parrish is being sent out under the
auspices of the National W. C. T. U., and
a large number of ladies interested in the
blue - ribbon cause were present at the
headquarters to wish the missionary god
speed on her way.
The rooms had been charmingly deco
rated with flowers for the occasion, and
the brief speeches, which formed the in
formal programme, were diversified with
music and recitations. Miss Parrish,
i simply dresaed in a dark costume, with a
' gay bouquet of flowers at her waist, was
the recipient of many hand-shakes and
good wishes during the intermissions in
the programme. During some of the ad
dresses she was visibly moved by the
words of friendship and admonition
spofcen by her elders in the temperance
cause, and when first called on for a
speech she said half biokenly that there
are moments when thought lies too deep
for words.
Among the speakers who gave words of
cheer to the outgoing missionary were:
Mrs. Sturtevant Peet, president of the
California W. C. T. U. ; Mrs. Grace Kim
ball of Oakland; Mrs. F. D. Spencer, who
gave accounts of other missionaries who
had gone out to the Orient; Mrs. Hobson
of Sacramento, who said that her interest
in the work had never flagged since 1873.
Mrs. Reeoner of Toledo, Mrs. Oraise and
Mrs. Gilmore of Denver, Miss Cdlbertson
and Mrs. Henrietta Brown also spoke en
couraging words.
Miss Hewitt of South America said that
In Montevideo there was a band of ardent
workers. Rev. Mr. Hendry, a former mis
sionary in China, made an earnest ad
dress, describing the baleful effects of
opium In the flowery land. During the
last two decades he said the opium habit
bad increased to an alarming extent in
China, and he severely scored the British
Government for tacitly encouraging the
opium trade.
When asked for an account of her pro
posed work Miss Parrish said that her
plans would depend a good deal upon
circumstances. '-Japan is my first
thought, and after that Australia," she
said. "I am willing to give the best part
of my life to the Japanese, but 1 do not
know how they will look upon my wonr."
The reception concluded with brief ad
dresses by Mrs. Ada Van Pelt and other
visitors.
Miss Clara Parrish is well known in the
temperance field in this country. She is a
native of Paris, lit., and in 1889 was ap
pointed field organizer for her own branch,
and in 1892 she became National organizer
for the young woman's branch, and since
then has done effective work in twenty
four different States.
AT THE TIVOLI.
A Large Audience Listens to a New
Double Bill.
The new bill at theTivoli last night con
sisted of the balcony and marriage scenes
from "Romeo and Juliet," followed by the
"Cavalleria Rusticana," for the first time
this season. Both performances elicited
warm applause from a large audience.
In the "Romeo and Juliet" excerpts the
three principals repeated their excellent
work of the second night of the season.
Sie;nor Michelena made an impassioned
Romeo, Nina Bertini Humphrys was a
thoroughly satisfactory Juliet, both vocally
and histrionically, and Signor Abramoff's
hne voice and manly bearing did good
service in the role of Friar Laurence.
The "Cavalleria" was given in two acts,
as Mascagni originally wrote it. The
intermezzo was played as a prelude to the
second act. Nina Bertini Humphrys made
an effective Santozza, and she sang the
music of her role with a good deal of finish
and expression. Bernice Holmes was a
good Mamma Lucia, but Irene Mull had j
hardly dash and magnetism enough for j
the role of Lola.
Martin Pache made some confusion of i
tongues by singing in English while the
others warbled in Italian. Vocally speak
ing, he was not an ideal Torrida, but the
force of his acting did much to atone for
vocal shortcomings. The role of Alfio is
always something of a thankless one, but
John J. Raffael wrestled well with its dif
ficulties and succeeded in producing a
very eood impression.
The choruses were ttie weakest point In
the opera. Some of them showed sisns of
insufficient rehearsal, but the Easter
chorus, "Let us sing to the Lord," went
excellently.
To-night "Traviata" will be given.

Fate of the Oak- Street Line.
colonel Charles F. Crocker, president of the
Market-street Railway Company, had the
honor of a visit from a delegation of Oak-street
property-owners yesterday. They came to ask
him the intentions of the company relative to
the abandoned portion of the Oak-street cable
line. He stated to them that he had but just
returned from a tour abroad and had not been
able to give the matter consideration. He
said that he would take tbe matter up and
would be prepared to talk further to the prop
erty-owners of that thoroughfare through
their representatives in about ten days. The
representatives leit with the determination to
return for, a definite answer after the period
Mr. Crocker required for coming to a decision.
A. PAGE BROWN'S BONDS
A Mistake in Brown's Plans for
the New Ferry Depot
Discovered.
Uncle Sam Wi 1 Have to Pay Rent
for All Hs Offices on the
Water Front.
The Harbor Commissioners have dis
covered a mistake in the late A. Page
Brown's plans for the new ferry depot.
Owing to a transposition of a figure the
State will be put to many thousands of
dollars expense, and now the question
arises, "Who is to pay for the blunder?"
The Commissioners discussed the matter
at yesterday's meeting, and it was finally
decided to instruct Tirey L. Ford, the
board's attorney, to 'confer with the late
architect's bondsmen, to see if an amicable
j understanding cou.d not be reached. The
! commission is determined not to shoulder !
the expense entailed in correcting the
blunder. B.i the late architect's estate or hi
bondsmen will have to suffer.
The Stonecutters' Union sent three rep
resentatives to represent them before the
commission. They asserted that Sub
contractor O'Neil had said that men on
stone work would be made .to labor ten
hours a day. President Colnon assured
them that eieht hours would constitute a
day's work and that all contractors would
be held strictly to that line.
Chief Wharfinger Root reported to the
board that the customs authorities occu
pied twelve places on the water front and
that only one paid rent. President Colnon
suggested a conference with the Collector
of the Port, and it was decided to ask Mr.
Wise to be in attendance at to-morrow's
meeting. President Colnon will insist
that Uncle Sam pay his dues the same as
any private individual.
The coal market is overstocked and a
number of vessels are idle in consequence.
Yesterday the steamer Portland was laid
off, and this afternoon she will go to Oak
land Creek to lie up.
The police on the front are after lottery
dealers. Yesterday they arrested A.
Bertleson and found on him 110 Mexican
tickets. The latter were confiscated and
the prisoner was locked up in the Harbor
Police station.
The shin Hawaiian Isles arrived in
Sydney, N. S. W., yesterday. Captain
Kustel reports light winds all the way.
Captain Kustel of the barkentine Sharp
shooter and Captain Kustel (brothers) of
the Hawaiian Isles saikd within a few
days of each other. Owing to some de
fective work done by a relative of A. P.
Lorentzen, the Sharpshooter had to put
bsck for repairs. The barkentine thus
lost nearly two weeks. Nevertheless, she
beat the Hawaiian Isles over a week into
port.

ANOTHER LECTURER COMING.

Help the Cause.
Picnic oratory is a field in which the
brilliant lady orators of the woman suf
frage cause have had little chance to dis
tinguish themselves, at least in this State.
Now, however, the party leaders are com
mencing to invite the more eloquent
speakers connected with the movement to
attend the country frolics of their followers
and address the festive gatherings on the
theme which holds so deep an interest for
tne women of California.
"Yes," remarked Miss Mary E. Hay, the
State organizer and chairman of the
Woman auffrage State Central Committee
yesterday, "we are going to shine on the
picnic platform as well as on the stage.
Not that the politicians will expect us to
caper about over the dancing floor, but
they do want us to talk about suffrage to
people who are out in the woods for a good
time. We have selected a few of our beat
speakers for the work, and whatever ot er
fault the audiences may find at all events
they will not call the suffrage speeches
dry."
Among the speeches to be delivered in
the near future at picnics and elsewhere
will be several by Mrs. Carrie Chapman-
Uatt, a well-known suffrage orator, who
will soon arrive from the East. The
lady's success in the East has been phe
nomenal, and her advent in California
will, it is believed, be a great help to the
suffrage cause during tne ensuing cam
paign. She will speas at a series of par
lor meetings on the evenings of the 7th,
Bth and 10th of September and at the Popu
list picnic to be held on the9th of Septem
ber at Haywards. Miss Anthony will
"talk suffrage," as she calls it, before the
Laurel Club on the 2d of September, and
at the picnic of tue Alameda County Equal
Suffrage Club at Leona Heights on the
9tb. Mrs. Ida C. Hazlett will address
Populist picnickers at Tulareand Modesto
on the 28th and 29th insts., Mrs. E. G.
Greene performing a similar office at Wat
sonviile on the 28th. Miss Shaw will
lecture at Martinez on the night of the
27th inst., at Simpson Memorial Church
in this City on the 28th, before the Oak
land Y. M. C. A. on the 6th of September,
and before the Labor Council of this City
on the following evening in Metropolitan
Temple.
"I thought my cup of joy was full as I
left that glorious meeting last Saturday
night," said Miss Anthony, "but now a
new happiness has been granted to me. I
have just received the encouraging news
that in Idaho the Democrats, Populists
and Silverites have all adopted a woman's
suffrage plank in their party platforms,
and 1 am assured that the .Republicans
will do the same at their convention,
which is to open on the 26th of this
month. Idaho has been well organized
witn woman suffrage clubs for over a
year, some of our best speakers having
been laboring there ever since the agita
tion commenced.
"The example of California has evi
dently born fruit in Idaho, and when the
State has once admitted women to the bal
lot, the influence of this good example
will be even mere powerful and far-reach
ing. Our cause owes much to The Call,
which we all regard as our paner. I hear
its circulation has greatly increased, es
pecially in the interior districts, since its
espousal of the woman suffrage cause.
The interest which women in the country
are taking in the present tight for equal
political rights is most intense. I know
of cases where they have traveled ten, fif
teen, twenty or more miles, over dusty,
hot roads, in order to attend a suffragist
meeting or get the latest news of the
movement The Call has become, so to
speak, a gospel of hope to these devoted
women of the farm and sierra."

A new qtone sidewalk and a three-foot
stone wall of the same material are being
t>ut down around the square, which,
though small, lying a=< it does between
Treat avenue, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-sixth,
and Harrison streets, is nevertheless quite
a boon to the residents in that section.
This improvement to the sidewalk will
necessitate the removal of about three
feet of earth from the front of the square,
j where it is that much too high to conform,
I with the grade on Treat avenue. With
the removal of this elevation the large,
unsightly and offensive shacgy pines on
that line will be cut down and converted
into firewood.
This improvement, together with the
improvements about Aita square, between

under the immediate supervision of

THEIR STANDING UNDECIDED.
An Important Ruling by the Highest
Tribunal Affecting Numerous
Pub'.ic Servants.
â¢â¢We hold therefore that under the
county-government act of 1893 the terra
of office of all county and township offi
cers is fixed at four years."
This i 3 the gist of the decision handed
down by the Supreme Court yester
day in tbocaseof Hale vs. McGettigan.on
appeal from Solano County. It was writ
ten by Justice Harrison and received the
indorsement of the other Supreme Court
Justices.
THE DECISION.
IN BANK.
Hale, respondent, vs. McGettigan et al.,
appellants.
This action was brought for the purpose of
determining the validity of the county govern
ment act, approved March 24, 1893 (statutes
of 1893, page 346), and to obtain a judgment
that the county and township officers elected
under that act hold their respective offices for
the term of four years. A general demurrer to
the complaint was overruled by the court, and
the defendants declining to answer, judgment
was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, lrom
which the defendants appealed.
1. It is contended on the part of the appel
lants that the act in question never became a
law for the reason that it appears from the
legislative journals that the bill therefor was
introduced in the Legislature after the ex
piration of fifty days from the commencement
of the session in contravention of the pro
visions of section 2, article IV, of the constitu
tion. The respondent contends, on the other
hand, that the enrolled bill deposited with
the Secretary of State is conclusive of the
validity of the act and that it is not compe
tent for the court to go behind this enrolled
bill for the purpose of determining whether
the Legislature complied with this require
ment of the constitution; and in support
thereof cites the case of Sherman vs. Story. 30
Cal., 253, where it was held that the certifi
cates ot the presiding officers of the two
houses that a bill bad been passed was con
clusive of the point in question. It is urged
by the appellant in response to this that the
present constitution described certain for
malities to be observed by the Legislature
and certain times at and within which the
steps essential to enact a statute are to be ob
served which were not included in the con
stitution of 1649, under which the case of
Sherman vs. Story was decided, and, that un
less these constitutional requirements for the
enactment of a statute are complied with, an
act passed by the Legislature does not become
a law, and that the journal of the Legislature
may be examined for the purpose of ascertain
jug whether the act was passed in conformity
with these requirements. It is, however, un
necessary for us to determine in the present
case whether the journal of either branch of
the .Legislature may under the circumstances
be examined for the purpose of impeaching
the- validity of an act that has been duly en
rolled and deposited - with the Secretary of
State, since we are of the opinion that it does
not appear from these journals that the act in
question was not constitutionally passed.
History of the Act.
The session of the Legislature at which the
act in question was passed commenced Jan
uary 2, 1893. Before the expiration of fifty
days from this date eight diftcrent bills enti
tled "An act to amend 'An act to establish a
uniform system of county and township gov
ernments, approved March 31, 1891,'" and
twenty-nine other bills amendatory of differ
ent sections of the same act were introduced
in the Assembly. Of tne latter Assembly bill
74 was entitled an "Act to amend section 165
of said act." These bills were referred to the
Committee on County and Township Govern
ment,', on March 2 that committee re
parted to the Assembly a substitute lor all of
said bills, and recommended its passage and
the substitute was thereupon ordered printed.
(Assembly Journal, page 824.) March 8 As
sembly bill 74 was r'&ad the . first time
and placed on file for second read
ing. March 9 this bill was .read a
second time, whereupon '"the Committee on
County and Township Government offered a
substitute (the County Government Bill), en
titled, 'An act to establish a uniform system
of county, and township governments,' "
which was read end adopted (Assembly jour
nal, p. 1001), and on the same day the Assem
bly ordered that the other of the above bills
that had been referred to this committee be
withdrawn and stricken from the files, "they
have been embodied in the omnibus county
government bill, now known as substitute for
Assembly bill No. 74" (p. 1003). Various
amendments were thereafter made to the
"substitute for Assembly bill No. 74," and on
March 13 it was passed by the Assembly and
transmitted to the Senate, where it was after
ward passed by that uody. ;>.-
There cau be no presumption that the Leg
islature has disregarded any constitutional re
quirement in the passage of the statute, and if
the journals are silent upon the observance of
any constitutional requirement, it cannot be
assumed that such requirement was omitted
by the Legislature. (People vs. Dunn, 80 Cal.,
211.) II a bill has been introduced in either
house within the first fifty days of the session,
whatever is proper in the way of amendment
is as admissible after the fifty, days as before,
and this will include whatever is within the
purpose of the bill. By the same rules a sub
stitute that is germane to the subject of the
bill may be adopted without violating this
provision of the constitution, since such sub
stitute is in effect only an . enlarged amend
ment to the bill for which it is offered. (Toll
vs. Jerome, 101 Mich., 468.) The various bills
for which the substitute in the present
instance was reported, relating to the county
government act of 1891, some of them pur
port by their titles to amend the entire act
and others to amend certain sections of the
act, and it was within the proper functions of
the committee to which they were referred for
consideration to consolidate them into one
bill if, in its judgment, it was expedient, and
to report the same as a substitute for them all.
Such report and substitute, instead of being
the introduction of a new bill, was only bring
ing together before the House in a revised form
bills that had already been introduced and re
ferred to that committee, with a recommenda
tion from it for the action by the House which
that committee deemed advisable.
Conflicting Provision*.
2. It is further contended by the appellant
that the provision in section 60 of the act for
holding the election of county officers every
lour years is either superseded by a provision
in section 170, that such election shall be every
two years, or, if the latter provision is to be
limited to counties of the eighth class, that
the uniformity of the act is destroyed, and the
entire act must be held to be unconstitutional.
The first 161 sections of the act are general'
in their character, prescribing the duties and
powers of the several county and township
officers and are applicable to j all the counties
in the State. = By section 162 the several coun
ties are divided into fifty-three classes, "for
the purpose of regulating the compensation of
- all officers hereinafter provided for," and in
the succeeding fifty-three sections the compen
sation of the officers of these several classes is
fixed. Section 57 of the act designates the
several offices of I . a. county, and -.section 58
those of a township. Section 60 declares: :
* "All elective county and i township officers
except otherwise provided for in this j act shall
be elected at the general election to be held in
November, 1894, and every four years there
after, unless otherwise herein provided, and
t hall take - office at 12 o'clock, meridian, on
the first Monday after the first day of January
next succeeding their election." :: Section 170
fixes the compensation <of the p county and
township officers in counties of '.he eighth
class, and is divided into twenty-six subdivi
sions. Subdivision twenty-six is in the fol
lowing terms: -'â¢';" '. vv' ;-'â¢/=â  f
"The officers mentioned in section 57 of this â¢
act, except as hereinafter provided, shall be J
elected in the yew 1894, and every two years i
thereafter, and shall take office at 12 o'clock,
meridian, on the first Monday alter the first
day of January next succeeding their elec
tion" ; and subdivision. twenty-four provides
that all of i, the provisions in the section re
lating to counties of this class shall take im
mediate' effect. These "provisions of section
170, if literally construed, are in direct con
flict with the provisions of section 60 in this
respect, that by section 60 "'all elective county
and township officers" are to be elected every
four year?, while by subdivision twenty-six of
section 170 "the ; officers Â» mentioned 'in sec
tion 57 of this act" are to be s elected every
two years, and from this repugnance it is con
tended that the. act is thereby rendered of no
effect. â  *
Intention of the Legislature. â¢_>- ,
â¢ It is a cardinal rule that a statute shall be
given effect, if possible, and, if by proper con
struction of the language used in different sec
tions provisions which [ are apparently con
flicting can be ) harmonized, it is the duty of
courts to so interpret the statute that all its
provisions will be allowed to stand. It is not
to be assumed that the Legislature intended
by the same statute to enact two inconsistent
provisions and to declare that the terms of all
county officers should be lour years and at the
same time- that they should be two years. For
the purpose of ascertaining the intention of
the Legislature in the matter we may con
sider the form in which tne different
provisions of the statute have been
passed, as well . as the - position of
the different provisions in reference to other
parts of the act, The provisions for holding
an election every two years is found in a sub
division of the 'section relating to counties of
the eighth class and should not be construed
as applicable to any other class or as impairing
the previous provision of nil classes, unless
imperatively required by its language. By
limiting the clause used in this subdivision of
section 170, "the officers mentioned in section
57 of this act," to the officers mentioned in
section 57, who may be elected in counties of
the eighth class, we avoid a construction
which would neutralize the provisions of sec
tion 60 and at the same time follow a natural
rule of construction, in holding that the
Legislature intended the provisions of
section 170 for counties of the eighth class
alone, and that all of its subdivisions are sub
ordinate to this intention ana inapplicable to
the counties of any other class. This con
struction finds support in the fact that the day
upon which the election of county officers is
to be held is found only in section 60, whereas
subdivision 26 of section 170 designates mere-
Iv the year in which the officers are to be
elected, thus impliedly referring to the former
section for the day of election and making that
section applicable to the officers of the
eighth class. It must, therefore, be held that
the Legislature did not intend that the pro
visions of this subdivision of section 170
should be applicable to any other county than
those in the eighth class.
The question is then presented, What effect
does this special provision for the counties of
this class have upon the entire act ? It is con
tended by the appellants that by reason of
this special provision of the counties of one
class the uniformity of the act, which is re
quired by the constitution, is destroyed and
that the entire act is void. It is not to be con
troverted that a statute providing for a system
of county governments which in its terms is
limited to a portion of the State would be in
contravention of the provisions of the consti
tution which require the Legislature to pass a
uniform system for the entire State; but it is
contended by the respondent that the special
provision for" one class of counties in an act
purporting to provide for air classes may be j
disregarded as being beyond the power of the j
Legislature and the general provision of the
act sustained and made applicable to all the
counties of the State.
An Unconstitutional Provision.
Whether a statute containing an unconsti
tutional provision, with others which are con
stitutional, will be sustained as to those which
are constitutional and held invalid merely as
to those which are not, depends upon the
nature, of the different provisions in view of
the evident purpose of the Legislature. If the
provisions arc so interdependent that those
which are invalid are to be regarded as the
condition or consideration upon which others
were enacted, and it Is evident that the Legis
lature would not have enacted the statute ex
cept in its entirety, and did not intend that any
part should have effect unless the whole could
be made operative, the entire statute â  must
be held invalid. On the other hand, if the
different parts of a statute are severable and
independent of each other, and the provisions
which are within the constitutional power of
the Legislature are capable of being carried
into effect after the void part has been
eliminated, and it is clear from the
statute itself that it was the intent of the Leg
islature to enact these provisions irrespective
of the others, the unconstitutional provisions
will be disregarded and the statute read as if
these provisions were not there. For the pur
pose of statutory construction the Intention of
the Legislature, as shown by the general scope
and purpose of the law, is to be ascertained.
It is never to be assumed that the Legislature
intended to enact an unconstitutional statute
or that it supposed that any part of an act was
beyond its constitutional power; and if the
general scope of an act is within its power the
act is not to be rendered null by reason of a
subsidiary provision which was beyond its
power to enact. If the manifest purpose <^f the
Legislature can be carried into effect by up
holding the act and disregarding such subsid
iary provisions that purpose will not be de
feated by an unconstitutional provision con
tained in a subordinate section In the act.
The title of the present act is, "An act to es
tablish a uniform system of county and town
ship governments," and this title, as well as
the scope of the statute, may be considered for
the purpose of determining the intention of
the Legislature. It must be assumed, from the
language used in the title, that the Legislature
intended to . comply . with the constitutional
requirements to provide. for the election of
county officers by a uniform law applicable to
all the counties in the State, and that the act
in question should be operative throughout
the State. . By reason ot the constitutional pro
hibition against the passage of: a special or
local law on this subject, any separate act con
taining the provisions of subdivision twenty
six of section 170 would have been Invalid and
would not have affected the uniformity of
the general act. The provisions of this sub
division are none ; the less unconstitutional
when made an integral part of a general act
from which they . are â¢ severable . than they
would be if found in an independent act, and,
being unconstitutional, may be disregarded as
fully as though embodied in a separate statute.
In Christie vs. Board of Supervisors, 39 Cal.,
3. the Legislature had changed the time lo*
the election of the Supervisor of Sacramento
County, and provided that the terms of three
of the Supervisors then in office should be ex
tended for two years beyond the time for
which they had been elected. To the conten
tion that the Legislature had no power to
extend the term of office, and that, therefore,
the entire act was invalid, it was said that the
power to change the time of the election was
unquestioned and that it was perfectly plain
that such was the â  evident purpose 'of the
act, and that "if in addition to the exercise !
oi this undoubted power, they have coupled it
with an attempt to penorm an unconstitu
tional act by continuing the incumbent In
office until October, 1871, â . the only result
would be that the attempt would be abortive
aDd that portion of the act would be void. But
this result would in no degree impair the effi
ciency of the act as a valid enactment changing
the time of the election from .1869 to 1871."
Similar principles were announced in People
vs. Mr.Creary, 34 Cal., 433; Rood vs. McCargar,
49 Ca!., 117; and Mills vs. Sargent, 36 Cal.,
379 (see, also, Robinson vs. Bidwell, 22 Cal.,
379). Mr. Cooley in his treatise on constitu
tional limitations, , p. 211, states the rule as
follows :
The Act Is {Valid.
"The : constitutional and unconstitutional
provisions may even be contained in the same
section and yet be perfectly distinct and separ
able, so that the first may stand though the
last jail. The point is not whether they are
contained in the same section for the distri
bution into sections is purely artificial, but
whether they are essentially? and inseparably
connected m substance. If, when the uncon
stitutional portion is stricken out, that which
remains is complete in itself and capable of
being executed in accordance with the appar
ent legislative intent, wholly independent ot
that which was rejected, it must be sustained.
If a statute attempts â  to . accomplish two 'or
more objects and , is void as to ' one it may still
be in every respect complete and valid as to
the other." . . Â«j. â â -'â  â â --Â.
We are of the opinion that the statute under
, consideration falls within this rule, and that,
as the provisions of subdivision twenty-six of
section 170 are invalid by reason of being
without the constitutional power of the Legis
lature to enact, they are to be disregarded.and
do not affect the validity of the act itself. Â« .
Â» 3. Section 15 of the county government act
i of 1883 (Stats, of 1883, p. 301) provided:
"At the general election to be held in the
year 1884 a full Board of Supervisors must be
chosen in each county. They shall so classify
themselves by lot that three of them shall hold
i office for four years, and two of them for
â¢ two years. The Supervisors elected - at
the general election in 1886, and
r every two . years thereafter shall Â hold
office , for four years. They shall take their
office on the first Monday after the first day of
i January after their election"; and section 60
i of the same ' act, " alter' providing that the
i elective county and township officers, except
ing Superintendents of Public | Schools | and
i Assessors, should be elected- every two years,
declared : "Supervisors : shall be ' elected 'as
hereinbefore provided," and that Assessors
â¢ and : Superintendents of Schools should be
. elected every four years. The provisions of
these sections remained in force until super
seded by the county government act of 1891
i (Stnt. of 1891, p. 251), of which section 15
was as follows: .^SnPBisPWP^BAMMTCH
; "The Supervisors elected at the general elec
tions held in the years 1888 and . 1890," and
every ; f our .;, years thereafter. shall s held office
for four yeais. They shall take their office on
the first monday after the first day of January
after their election." Section 60 of 'this act
was identical with, section. 60 of. the act of.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1895.
1883, and contained th,e same provision for
biennial elections, and also: "Supervisors
shall be elected as hereinbefore provided,' and
that Assessors and Superintendent of Schools
shall be elected every four years. Section 15
of the county government act of 189.3 (btat. ol
1893, p. 349) provides:
Conclusion* of the Court.
"The Supervisors elected at the general elec
tions held in the years 1888 and 1890, and
every four years thereafter, shall hold office
for lour years. They shall take their office on
the first Monday after the first day of January
after theirelecuon." Section (50, above quoted,
after providing that the election of all elective
county and township oflicers, "except other
wise provided for in this act," shall be quad
rennial instead of biennial, "unless otherwise
herein provided," and also declares: "Sui>er
visors shall De elected as hereinbefore pro
vided " From these provisions it results that,
with the exception of the two Supervisors in
each county, to whom a term of two years feu
by lot, as authorized by the act of 1883, the
term of office of Supervisors, which was orig
inally fixed at four years, has not been changed
by any subsequent act, and that the three
Supervisors who were elected in 1892 are
entitled to hold their office for four years, and
no longer, and that an election for other Super
vises must be held at the general election in
1890; while the two who were elected in 189-t
will continue to hold tneir office until their
successors are elected in 1898. Any different
construction would have the effect to hold
that the Legislature by the act of 1893 in
tended to extend the office of the three Super
visors eleettd in 1891 beyond the period for
which ihey were elected, in disregard of sec
tion 9, article XI, of the constitution. The
provisions in the act of 1893 for quadrennial
elections, in the twenty-second and thirty
seventh classes of counties for county officers,
"except three Supervisors," evidently refer
ring to the three Supervisors who were elected
in 1892, indicates that something of this
nature was in the mind of the Legislature.
We hold, therefore, that under the county
government act of 1893 the term of offices of
all county and township officers is fixed at
four years, and that those who were elected at
the general election in 1894 hold their office
for four years from the first Monday after the
first day of January, 18D5; that the term of
office of the three Supervisor In each county
who were elected at the general election in
1892 will expire on the tirst Monday after the
first day of January, 1897, and that their suc
cessors are to be elected at the general election
to be held in November ot the present year.
The Superior Court was, therefore, in error in
holding that none of the county officers were
to be elected at the coming election.
The judgment is therefore reversed, and the
Superior Court is directed to sustain the de
murrer to the complaint. Harbison, J.

Considerable excitement was created
amonij the local office-holders, their friends
and politicians of all shades.
It was at first thought that the decision
had direct application to the City and
County of San Francisco, but careful
perusal of it showed a most careful avoid
ance of any reference, direct or indirect, to
this County.
Just what the decision means Is clearly
indicated in the following interview with
an attorney who is well informed on every
phase of the litigation growing out of the
county government act of i 893.
"On its face," this gentleman said, "this
decision declares the so-called county
government act of 1893 constitutional.
In tba act different provisions were made
regarding counties of tha eighth class; j
that is, counties having a Dopulation j
between 32,000 and 32,500. In those coun- ]
ties the act provided aiuone other things
that the officers should be elected for two
years. This exception to the general
The Supreme Court has declared is *an
unconstitutional provision, and that there- |
fore the act has to be read in its general
provisions as applying to all counties,
including counties of the eighth Class.
'â¢This decision means that all county
officers elected in 1394 hold over for four
years, and that elections for county offi
cers will be held in 1898 and every four
years thereafter.
"The decision does not directly apply to
the City and County of San Francisco, but
other cases are pending in which this ques
tion will be raised.
"While it is true that courts never de
cide new questions, and therefore in this j
decision of a suit from Solano County the
Supreme Court waa not called upon to de
cide the constitutionality of the act in its
effects upon the County and City of San
Francisco, it would appear from the cur
rent of recent decisions that the act must
so apply or else be adjudged unconstitu
tional upon the appeal of the case pending
from San Francisco.
"The tendency of the Supreme Court of
recent years has been to strictly construe
provisions, requiring that all laws of a
general nature should have a uniform
operation and prohibiting the Legislature
from passing special laws regarding county
government and other matters where gen
eral laws would serve.
"The decision in the case of Denman vs.
Broderick, regarding the constitutionality
of the Election Commission, will clearly
show this tendency, and in the later case
of Miller vs. Curry, decided on August 7 of
this year, the reasoning of the court would
seem to be directly applicable to the con
stitutionality of the county government
act and of its application to San Fran
cisco.
"The county fee bill of 1895 did not in
terms refer to any city and county govern
ment as such, but provided generally for
county officers' fees. Upon the appeal of
the case of Miller vs. Curry it was tried to
show that the City and County of San
Francisco was not included in the provi
sions of the act. Upon this point the Su
preme Court said:
By article XI, section 5, of the constitution,
the Legislature is enjoined to provide a uni
form system of county government for the
various cities, to legulate the compensation of
county officers in proportion to their duties,
and to provide for the strict accountability of
all such officers for the fees and moneys col
lected by them in their official capacity. By
section 7 of the same article the provisions of
the constitution affecting cities and affecting
counties are, so far as may be. made applica
ble to consolidated city and county govern
! merits, whiie by article IV, section 25, of the
constitution, the Legislature is prohibited
from passing special or local laws affecting the
fees or salary of any officer (subdivision 25),
or prescribing the powers and duties of officers
in counties, cities, cities and counties (subdi
vision 28), or regulating county and township
business (subdivision 9).
The law under consideration Is general in
its terms, and, while it makes no distinct men
tion of officers In consolidated governments,
it undertakes to establish the fees, not alone
of county and township officers but of other of
ficers in this State. In the somewhat anoma
lous municipal corporations recognized by the
constitution, and known to the law as consoli
dated cities and counties, the officers do not
lose their distinctive characters as county offi
cers or of city officers merely because they
hold within the corporate limits of such gov
ernment. The County Clerk of the City and
County of San Francisco, the Sheriff of the
City and County of San Francisco, the Re
corder of the City and County of San Fran
cisco, are each and all county officers. They
have no place properly as officers of t city.
Upon the other hand the Mayor of the City
and County Is distinctly and separately a City
officer as distinguished from a County.
A law, therefore, which under the constitu
tional mandate undertook to regulate the du
ties or the compensation of connty officers
would fail of the basic requisite of the consti
tution that all laws of a general nature shall
have a uniform operation (Const., Art. I, sec.
2) if it should be held that its terms did not
apply, and were not meant to apply, to county
officers in consolidated governments. And it
must, therefore, be concluded, without room
for question, that the act under consideration
is in its terms applicable to the City and
County of San Francisco.
"In that case it was claimed that the act
of 1866, applying specially to San Fran
cisco, prevented the application of the
county fee bill to this City. Upon that
point the court said:
The Legislature is presumed to know the
constitution and the limitations upon its pow
ers therein set forth. In the cue at bar, as
has been said, the Legislature had only the
fiower to pass a general law upon '.he subject
n question, applicable to all county officers.
If it was the legislative Intent (and the legis
lative intent is always the ultimate fact to be
determined) to except the county officers of
the City and County of San Franciscoirom the
operation of the law, this might as well have
been done by an exception expressed iv
the terms of the act itself. No one
would for a moment question but that
such an exception would impair
the general operation of the law, and thug
violate the provisions of article I, section 2,
of the constitution. In that event either the
exception would be void, or, if inseparable
from the other parts of the law, the whole act
would fall. But that constitutional provision
would be no less violated if the Legislature
did not mean and intend that the statute- of
1866 should be repealed by the act of 1895.
The latter would still be a law purporting to
be general in its terms, yet not having a uni
form operfttioa by reasoa of. the exception in.
dicated. There i 8 thus c. plain repugnancy
between the act of 1866 and that Of 1895
which cannot bs disposed of except upon tho
conclusion that the Legislature intended in
the act of 1895 to pass a valid law, and that to
do so the repeal of the act of 1866 necessarily
resulted.
"Of course, in the decision of yesterday
the Supreme Court only decided the two
questions presented by the appeal â that
is, whether the formal steps required in
the passage of an act had been complied
with, and whether the exception regarding
counties of the eighth class invalidates
the whole act; or whether, as the Supreme
Court decided, that exception might be
dropped from the act.
"If it should be held that the act does
apply to San Francisco, the incumbents
who would be affected are the Sheriff,
County Clerk, Auditor, Recorder, Tax
Collector, District Attorney, Assessor,
Treasurer, Superintendent of Schools,
Public Administrator, Coroner, Surveyor
and members of the Board of Supervisors,
and probably Justices of the Peace."
Supreme Justice Garoutte, in speaking
of the decision, said it applied to all the
town and county officers of the State ex
cepting those of the City and County of
San Francisco. The special legislation
governing thecountv and municipal offices
in San Francisco, he said, was and would
remain in its former force, without any
modification or alteration.
Justice McFarland, when interviewed at
his residence last night, was very clear and
brief as to the Supreme Court decision in
its application.
"It was upon an action brought to de
termine the validity of the county govern
ment act, approved March 24, 1893," said
he, "to obtain judgment that the county
and townsnip officers elected under that
act were entitled to hold their respective
offices for a term of four years. A general
demurrer to the complaint was overruled
by the Superior Court and the defendants
declining to answer, judgment was ren
dered against them, from which the de
fendant appealed.
"The decision applies in general to all
the counties of the State. There is no
special application to San Francisco
County whatever. That question did not
come before the Supreme Court, and it
was not considered by that body. As to
whether San Francisco comes under the
provisions of the act I can only say that it
is a question that must be considered and
decided hereafter.
"This decision, just as it reads, settles
the validity of the act as applied in gen
eral to all county and township offices
and nothing else. Ido not see how I can
make it any plainer. The Supreme Court
only confined itseif to the matter brought
before it and decided accordingly."
While the decision in the Solano County
case gave no indication of what the de
cision of the court would be in the case of*
Kabn against Sutro et al., involving the
application of the county government act
to San Francisco, speculation was rife
among the politicians last night as to what
would happen if the act was so made ap
plicable. Â«
It was recalled by tbe intelligent ones
that if the law chancing the terms of
county officers to four years was made ap
plicable to San Francisco there would still
be left for tbe coming election the purely
municipal offices, such as Mayor, SuDerin
tendentof Streets, City and County At
torney, Police Judges and other offices not
embraced in the general county govern
ment scheme. The main patronage
offices, however, including those of the
County Clerk, Recorder, Tax Collector,
Auditor, Supervisors and other?, would
hold for another two years.
Another consideration generally recog
nized was that if the patronage officers of
tha City and County were given another
two years of power it would have a very
strcne effect in support of the new char
ter. The practical politicians are largely
against the pending charter, as they have
always been and always will be opposed
to any change in the law which makes
patronage jobs harder to get through the
political methods tiiey ai" used to.
But if there is no further patronage to
be dealt out for two years and if the
"outs" see their only hope of jobs In the
election of a Mayor and the general
change through the adoption of the new
charter they will either call in their hos
tilitj to it or get out and help whoop it
through. For this particular reason a
four-year local decision would add a small
army of voters to the forces behind the
new charter.
SORROW IN OAKLAND.
There Is Some Little Joy, However,
Amonsr "The Pulls" Over the
Chance of More Pap.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Aug. 25. j
There is joy among "the pulls" and
deep sorrow, even to a suggestion of sacK
cloth and ashes, among "the push." It is
all due to the decision handed down this
afternoon sustaining the four-year term
for county and townsnip officers.
There has been much speculation and
building of fences by some of the county
officials, who feared that their official
lives were to be halved. They all pro
fessed to be sure of the Jong term, but at
the same time they were laying wires in
case iheir fears and not their desires came
out on top.
The decision has altered the complexion
of things, and will have a marked effect
on the combinations that were being
made with Supervisorial candidates and
aspirants for the Legislature.
There is much rejoicing *ud congratula
tion in some quarters, because the favor
able decision was the only hope of many
to serve the country for another two years.
The political aspect of the county has so
changed that not more than one-half of
those now in office could hope to be re
elecied. But they are safe now, and those
who wanted to see a change must pocket
their disappointment.
The offices to be filled now are so few
and the number of politicians out of a job
so numerous that there will be a struggle
for office during the next three mouths
Buch as is seldom seen.
Although a desperate effort will be
made to retain the retiring Supervisors
there is no reason to suppose that the
vote in thair favor will be any larger than
that given to Judge Frick. The "Friend"
element have candidates for all the offices
and there will be two tickets of delegates
in every ward.
The candidates who have already an
nounced themselves for eyery office are
legion and the hangers-on have decided
that as there are so few offices they must
\?ork them for all that they can be made
to produce.
It is acknowledged that more than half
of those now in the field have only
entered for the purpose of being bought
off. Indeed, the price paid Judas would
seem to be many times tbe value of some
who have already got their faces on
tickets.
The decision of the Supreme Court is not
received with entire satisfaction by the re
spectable element of the community, who
would like to see some changes in the
present county government.

The Referee Declares the
Stilzner-Van Buskirk
Fight a Draw.
DECISION SATISFACTORY
Stelzner Lands Oftenest, but
Van Buskirk Forces the
Fighting.
PINCUS WINS OViiR O'BKIEN.
Purcell Avoids Pepper by "Skipping."
Judge Campbell Declines to
Act as Substitute.
A satisfactory series of contests so far
as clean ana close fighting was con
cerned occurred last night at the Grove
street Theater under the auspices of tbe
National Club. It resulted in a draw be
tween Stelzner and Van Buskirk: and in
Ed Pincus getting the decision over "Kid"
O'Brien. The Purcell- Peppers contest did
not materialize, as during the afternoon
Purcell "flew de coop," according to the
explanation of Billy Jordan, master of
ceremonies.
The first contest, tnat between Pincus
and O'Brien, was spirited from start to
finish, and both men fought gamely.
Pincus, however, clearly outclassed the
man from Los Angeles and was given the
decision by Billy Shannon, the referee.
There were loud calls for another round
at the expiration of the sixth round, and
O'Brien, who remained in the ring, walked
to the ropes and said: ''You will have to
admit I did as much fighting as the other
fellow." This remark was cheered, but
Pincus had already received the decision
and left the ring.
Then came the event of the evening, the
fight between Stelzner and Van Buskirk.
Both men were cheered on entering the
ring. The former was seconded by Patsy
Corrigan, Joe Choynski and Jimmy Car
roll, the latter by AlexGreggains and Tom
Johnson.
The master of ceremonies announced
that the fignt was to last ten rounds and
that Biliy Shannon would again act as ref
eree. Beth men were introduced, and
iSielzner received the louder applause,
doubtless because he looked at least fifteen
pounds the lighter. His condition was ex
cellent, but Van Buskirk looked slightly
flabby.
At the sound of the gong the men went
at it, Van Buskirk looking determined and
Stelzner cool. The whole fight may be
briefly summed up by stating that Stelzner
had the better of it in the opening round,
Van Buskirk in the middle of the light â
his opponent appearing weak â but that
SteJzner punched Dim at will during the
latter part of the fight. If his blows had
not lacked force heâ would have had his
burly opponent nut in the seventh round.
Stelzner landed repeatedly with his left
in the tirst round, both on the body and
face. Van Buskirk struck wild. Both men
went to their corners blowing. This WB3
Stelzners round.
The second round was about even as re
gards honors. Both men landed several
vicious punches. Stelzner showed himself
a master of left-hand jabs on the jaw,
while Van Buskirk's blows were mostly
deliveictl on the body with tbe right.
In the thirl round it was freely prophe
sied that Steizner would go out, as he ap
peared very tired, but managed to avoid
punishment by clinching. Cries of foul
and repeated hissing were heard near the
close of the round at what seemed to be
an attempt on Van Buskirk's part to
choke his opponent, whose head was
under his arm. Stelzner landed a vicious
left swing on the jaw as the gong sounded.
This was cleany Van Bnskirk's round,
as he landed as often as, and more heavily
than SteJzner, but the latter stood the
punishment well.
From tne fifth to the eighth round Stelz
ner landed at will, and had Van Buskirk
so groggy in the seventh round that
it looked as if only the tap of the gong
saved him from going out.
Stelzner landed as many as five
straight left-band jabs in succession on
the point of Van Buskirk's jaw in this
round, and the crowd went wild with ex
citement. In the eighth round Van Bus
kirk fought as hard as failing strength
would permit. Both men appeared very
tired.
In the last two rounds Van Buskirk
ruohed the fighting and the men clinched
repeatedly. Stelzner brought his left
hand jab on the jaw into action with great
effect in stopping these onslaughts and
alternated with his right on the body.
None of the blows could put Van Buskirk
out, however, as SteJzner wa^s clearly very
weak.
In the concluding round Stelzner went
in to knock his man out and struck him as
often as he pleased, but Van Buskirk in
spiieof his weakness continually forced
the tight and was in the ring at the tap of
the gong.

S. H. Tacy of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, appeared before
the club last night and delivered an able
address upon the subject of "Home In
dustry," in the course of which he said:
I take it for granted that most of the gentle
men here to-night are property-ownersâ those
who own perhaps only the home they occupy,
and others may be who own many houses or
blocks of land, but all of whom are interested
in seeing their holdings increase in value.
You all know this then, that town lots are
worth more per square foot than the name ex
tent of land devoted to agriculture, and that
which gives value to town lota is population,
for that creates a demand for home and busi
ness blockÃ, and the population that is the
most profitably employed want the land and
will improve it according to their ability;
hence it is that the most valuable property is
where population is most denseâ in cities which
have the most people engaged in industrial
pursuitsâ and it is knowing this that causes
men when starting new towns to first lay It
out in streets and blocks, then to seek out
factories to locate in their midst.
PROPULSION OF BALLOONS.
Frenchmen Have -Made Many Improve
ment*.
In attempting to propel a balloon of the
usual shape the great difficulty met with
is that immediately it begins to move
against the wind the big bae of gas is
forced out of shape, and, in proportion to
the propelling power applied, threatens
to engulf the car and its tenants in its
folds or to suffocate them with the gas,
which is caused to escape by the alter
ation of its capacity with change
of shape, says the Gentlemen's Maga
zine. Ihe other difficulty is the construc
tion of a powerful enough and yet
light motor which does not require fire to
work it. Though many attempts have
been made, advance has been very slow.
Ttie French, who have persistently stuck to
the balloon from a national pride in its in
vention and who have done most for it 3
improvement, have made some notable
steps in the matter of balloon propulsion.
Thus, toward the close of the Franco-
German war, M. Dupuv de Lome, a naval
builder, constructed a balloon with a rud
der and a screw driven by the passengers.
It was found that a velocity, apart from
that of the air current, of about six miles
an hour could be obtained.
Considerably better results have been
obtained by Messrs. Krebs ana Renard
with their cigar-shaped balloon, inflated
with hydrogen and propelled by an electro
motor driven by storage batteries. They
have succeeded in traveling a little more
than twelve miles an hour in fair weather
and in steering in any direction, even re
turning exÃctly to their starting point,
but in windy weatber tbe apparatus has
not been tried. To brave any moderately
strong wind the machine would require
to travel something like fifty miles an
hour, but these French officers do not ex
pect to attain a speed of more than twenty
five miles an hour in the most favorable
circumstances. In the opinion of Maxim,
this dirigible balloon is as near perfection
as is ever iikely to be attained by a ma
chine depending on aerial flotation.
Ttie empire of the air is not to be won
by balloons. They have too many imper
fections and limitations, and, accordingly,
toil at first hopeful path must be aban
doned for the more difficult one of me
chanical flying. The bird must be im
stated as far as human powers, aided by
mitable devices to make up for the natural
deficiencies of man, can go. The ef
forts of those interested in the matter
have been of late mainly directed to flying
machines, which, though they must
necessarily be heavier than the air, yet
may find in their very weight an inertia
means for battling successfully with the
variable air currents. The subject has
been approached in many directions and
much encouragement has been gained as
tbe difficulties have been more thoroughly
understood.

EXAMINATION,
That Is, Joe McAuliffe
Was Sounded By Dr.
Barrett.
WEIGHS 222 1-2 POUNDS.
Vast Difference in the Way
His Trousers Fitted Once
and Now.
PROVED PHYSICALLY PERFECT.
Results of tbe Rigid Examination
McAuliffe Was Put Through by
the Physician.
Joe McAuliffe is in perfect physical con
dition for his fight with Choynski. Such
was the verdict ol Dr. J. 8. Barrett, City
autopsy physician, delivered at his offices
yesterday afternoon.
A party, composed of McAuliffe, Barney
Parley, "Young Mitchell" and a few news
paper representatives, went up to Dr.
Barrett's office with the express intention
of learning if Joe's losing sixty - foar
pounds in about two months bad materi
ally Interfered with his health. As far as
the skill of the physician can determine,
it has not.
"How tall are you, Joe?" queried the
examiner.
"Exactly 6 feet 3>Â£ inches," was the re
ply.
"How much do you weigh?"
"Jnst 222JÂ£ pounds. I was weighed this
morning."
"That's what he does," chipped in old
Barney delightedly. "Joey is all right bo
far as weight goes."
Then the physician began vo meaiure
the fighter's chest. He was made to stand
perfectly erect and follow directions in
breathing. At the close it was announced
that at forced respiration Joe's chest
measured 39 inches, at forced inspiration
43 inches, and at normal breathing 42
inches.
The next step was to tap the giant over
the lungs, heart and vital organs. Finally
the stethescope was applied. Daring this
process old Barney hung round like a
guardian angel.
"The heart sounds, respiration and
â¢pulse beats are normal," announced tne
doctor, "and the pulse beats seventy-five
times a minute."
"What is that you Bay, doctor?" said
Barney anxiously, edging a little closer.
"Everything is all right," was the an
swer, delivered with a grin.
The beatific expression that sprung into
existence on Barney's face was a pleasure
to witness. He chuckled, rubbed his
hands together, shook bands all around,
and then wanted to go out and treat. As
his protege's physical examination was
not over, this was considered highly inex
pedient.
"Ah, but I knew when I had Joey run
tho-e nine or ten miles a day it was going
to put him in shape," said the veteran
trainer, "and here lately I have reduced
the distance to six or seven."
The measurements of the biceps muscle
of the arm extended was given at 13%
inches; flexed, 15>Â£ inches; forearm, Yd
inches. Both arms measured exactly the
same.
The thi^h measured an even 25 inches,
and the calf 17 inches. Most wonderful of
all, tha waist measurement was only 36
inches. This is a pointer to those who
saw the big fellow two months ago, when
his paunch was simply a human bay-win
dow.
As his waist was measured. Joe laugh
ingly caugnt his trousers by the waist
band and held them away from his body.
The cavity thus formed was large enough
to drop a fifty-pound sack of flour in.
"They used to â¬t me tight," he ex
plained.
After going over McAuliffe carefully the
physician announced that his liver was
soft and all organs in a normal condition.
"I make no discovery of abdominal
lesions," he asserted, "and obtain nega
tive results from a urinary examination.
I might sum up my examination by stat
ing tnat I find McAuliffe's physical con
dition as nearly perfect as man can be."
The words were hardly out of his mouth
wnen Mitchell warningly laid his hand on
Barney's shoulder and told him to keep
cool. The look on the faithful trainer's
face showed that he would probably have
grabbed Joe ar.d delightedly hugged him
if the words had not been spoken.
Here one of the party expressed a desire
to see Joe's reach, so Df?"Barrett kindly
measured him. The result was almost
stunning. From finger tip to finger tip
McAuliffe measured exactly 80% inches
6 feet &% inches. He could "stand with his
back on a central column between lar^e
folding-doors and touch the outer joint of
each one at the same time.
McAuliffe's perfect condition is wholly
due to old Barney's indefatigable efforts to
bring him into form.
Choynsfei will go through an examina
tion to-day.
NO LONGER A CAPTAIN,
Downing of the St Paul Loses
His License as Master
and Pilot
Supervising Inspector Bermingham
Gives Some Good Advice to
Other Captains.
7 '
Captain Downing of the wrecked steamer
St. Paul is without legal license or title.
This was f decided in an opinion handed
down by the Supervising Inspector of
Hulls and Boilers yesterday.
After reviewing the testimony of Cap
tain Downing relative to the course and
speed of the vessel Captain Bermingham
says: .
"It was still foggy, but he thought be
could see a Jong way. The ship was all
the time going at full speed, and, without
at any time getting a cast of his lead,
she took the rocks and became a wreck at
11:10 p. M. The testimony of Captain
Downing as to the course steered is largely
corroborated by his third ' officer, J. .J.
Coleman, who had charge ,of ; the deck
watch from 6 p. M. up to the time the ship
took the rocks. . : *'S^^SHH
The court at this point reviews at length
the testimony of Quartermaster Wilson
and then comments rather severely on the
statement of the master:
The court Is of the opinion that the St. Paul
encountered a current between Point Bur and
Point Cypresf.whfch retarded her speed by the
land, possibly a mile and a half between those
points; in no other way can her final position
be accounted for, judging irom the course tes
tified to as having been steered at 10:35 P. M.
She must have passed dangerously close to
Cypress Rock thirteen minutes before. ::
Currents are not : unfrequent thereabouts*
Captain Downing does not aeem to have given
that matter proper attention, nor did he seem
to bear in mind the disaster that befell the
Columbia about three weeks before and only
about forty miles away, but over-confident of
his position as he kept on at full speed in
a fog without getting a cast of his Jpad, which
would surely have warned him of the danger
he was rushing upon and saved his ship.
What was the result? Another ship piled
upon the rocks, from which, fortunately for
the safety of the lives ou board, she did not
slip into'drep water.
The court finds that the St Paul was valued
at about $100,000, and her cargo at $15,000;
that her loss was occasioned by the negligence
and unskilltulness of ber licensed master and
pilot, J. C. Downing, who, besides violating
rule 21, section 4233, United States Revised
Statutes, by running his ship above a moderate
speed in afog; therefore it is hereby decreed
that the license of Baid J. C. Downing as master
and pilot be revoked, and he is hereby for
bidden to exercise the duties prescribed iv his
said license.
It is not unapproprlate for the court to state,
for the information of licensed masters and
pilots, ihat it is a common remark in the office
of the local Boards of Inspectors of steam
vesseU here that, if masters of wrecked steam
ers took a tithe of the pains in keeping their
ships at a safe distance from ganger that they
subsequently do in their examinations iv
explaining how they ran ashore, there would
be fewer disasters of the kind.

to her mother's residence at 2226 Jackson
street and said to her (Miss Smith) that he
had a ereat favor to ask of her; that some
Eastern capitalists with whom he ex
pected to have large dealings were com
ing to San Francisco and he was very de
sirous of pi esen ting a good appearance in
the business world; that he had only
some real estate to make a showing and
that he did not think it enough. The
favor he asked was that Miss Smith
should sien Over to him temporarily her
shares of stock that he might exhibit it as
his own. The witness said that her
mother demurred to this greatly, but that
Harvey finally persuaded her (the wit

it never returned to her. The Case is still
on trial.
THEIR HOMES BROKEN UP
A Young Wife Who Objected to
Her Husband Studying
So Much.
The Customary Lodger Who Won
the AffjctiriH ot the Land
lady.
A divorce was granted to James J.
Walsh from his wife, Minnie B. Walsh,
yesterday by Judge Hunt. The couple
were married only last October. The
cause of complaint was extreme cruelty.
The ilaintiff is a young draughtsman.
He testified that his wife complained that
he was ioo studious and that he did not
take her out enough; that she neglected
their homo and that he frequently went
out to loot for and found her in sa
loons; that he would take her home
and urge her to do better; that she would
admit that he wi.s a good hujband to her,
but that she fou,id it tiresome at home,
with him studying all the time. He ex
plained that it was for her benefit as well
as his own that he desired to advance him
self, but the exnlanat'on did not have any
effect; she grew more and more neglect
ful.
Andrew Brill was granted a divorce
yesterday from his wife, Kflfte. The cause
was a simple case of desertion. The
minor child was given into tht custody of
the plaintiff. The case was bei t c Judge
Murphy.
John F. Wood, a mechanic living on
Clara street, filed an answer and cross
complaint to petition for divorce entered
by his wife Lillian. The wife had ac
cused the husband of cruelty. Wood de
nies this, and in his complaint says he
lived happily with his wife until a few.
months ago, when Joseph Mnrdock was
taken into the house as a lodger. They
were then living at Vallejo, where Mur
dock still resides. He found a letter ad
dressed to hia wife from Murdock, and
this started the trouble. They then
moved to this City.
Since then his wife has more than once
left him, declaring she was going <o stop
over night with a certain lady friend. He
learned on each of the3e occasions, by
means of the telephone, that Murdock was
in San Francisco. Also he learned that
his wife did not stop with her lady friend
on either occasion. On one occasion she
staved away from home several days and
during her absence he met Murdock on
Grant avenne and they quarreled- He
also alleges that on one occasion he saw
his wife entering a lodging-house on How
ard street in company with a man named
Barlow. He followed and took her home.
He makes no direct allegation that his
wife has been unfaithful.
A Window Smasher.
Fred Stein, a young man, is fond of jail life,
and to enjoy it he adopts the plan of smashing
â¢windows. He was released from the County
Jail a few days ago, and on Friday ni^ht
smashed a window, valued at $150, in a Pow
eli-street store. Yesterday Judge Campbell
sent him back to the County Jail ior\ix
months. . Â»
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1896.
SOCIALISTS WERE
HELD GUILTY.
A Police Court Jury Is
Against Open-Air
Meetings.
DISTURBED THE PEACE.
Eight Members of the Socialistic
Labor Party to Ec Sen
tenced.
CURBING OF FREE SPEECH.
The City's Streets Must Not Be Used
for the Purpose of Holding
Public Meetings.
Many hundreds of people, men and
women with strong opinions as to their
right of free speech, were interested spec
tators in or about Judge Conlan's court
yesterday afternoon daring the trial ol
William Costley on a charge of disturbing
the peace.
The defendant and seven other mem
bers of the Socialistic Labor party were
arrested on the evening of the 15th inst.
while holding a public meeting on Seventh
street, near Market.
The offense with which the prisoners
was charged is but a misdemeanor in
volving only a light tine in the event of
conviction, but the principle involved â
that of a citizen's prerogative of giving
free utterance to his speech â rises so far
above all other considerations that attor
neys, politicians and men in every walk
of life were interested enough in the pro
ceedings to remain about the City Hall
even after nightfall to learn the results.
Justice of the Peace John A. Carroll,
acting as Police Judge instead of Judge
Conlan, who is on the sick list, presided.
R. H. Lloyd was special counsel for the
prosecution with Attorney J. J. Coffey.
Attorney Guilfoyle represented the de
fense, it oeing understood that the cases
of the eight defendants would stand or
fall upon the jury's verdict in the Costley
case.
Some forty talesmen were examined be
fore the jury was selected, the challenged
jurymen being principally members of
the Odd Fellows or other fraternal socie
ties. The twelve chosen men were: C. A.
Gerard, J. Sullivan, A. J. Hensely, Ej
Michaelson, E. Lomler, D. Hyde, j. F.
Mail, J. Robinson, J. Nash, \V. J. Doey,
J. Barton and P. Aune.
HOtticers P. Whalen and Edward O'Day,
the complaining witnesses, as well as the
arresting officers, testified to the numer
ous complaints that had reached them as
to the disturbance caused on Seventh
street by the socialistic meetings. They
told how they bad informed the defena
ants they must move on, but that they re
fused to do so.
"The defendant was not personally abu
sive," the policemen said, "neither did
any of them use obscene language. But
they roundly upbraided the authorities,
Judges, juries and Police Department for
having convicted one of their brother so
cialists for speaking in the open-air meet
ing held at Sixth and Folsom streets."
Ex-Judge LouderbacK, 8. M. Wycoff, C.
M. O'Neill, F. W. Warren and Andrew J.
Cleary, all directors or officers of the Odd
Fellows' Hall Association testified to
having their peace disturbed by the social
istic meetings held from time to time on
Seventh street, opposite their building.
They denied having any particular dislike
toward the socialists, as the Salvation
Army soldiers bad been quite as annoy
ing. But the soldiers never hesitated to
move away when told to do so, while the
socialists have resisted all appeals to that
end.
The defendant took the stand in his own
behalf. He told of his occupation as a
coachman for Mrs. a. Morgan. He said
that on the night of hia arrest he was a
member of the Socialistic Labor party's
campaign committee and the chairman of
the meeting which the police interrupted.
"I supposed Ihad a right to speak at the
meeting," said the witness. "I introduced
the speakers and believed they had aright
to speak. Therefore when I was told to
stop and move on I refused to do so.
'â¢The object of the meeting was to ex
pound the doctrines of the Socialistic
Labor party, and nothing objectionable so
far as language goes was uttered. Borne
of the speakers were men whom we hope
to have placed on the legal balloi as nomi
nees from our party."
Oliver Everett, an architect, and E. T.
I Kingsley, two prominent members of the
party, also testified in the same vein as
defendant, and the prosecution, to save
time, agreed that the forty odd other wit
nesses would also testify in a like manner.
The prosecution waived the opening
address to thfi jury, and the case was sub
mitted on orief arguments.
The jury returned a verdict of guilty.
Sentence will be pronounced this morning.
THE MORE ESTATE ROW.
The Suspended Executor Explains "Whj
He Should Not Be Punished
for Contempt.
John P. More went before Judge Cof
fey yesterday with affidavits of himself,
bis attorney, Thomas McNulta, Frank M.
Whitney and others by way of explaining
why he should not be punished for con
temt)t of court in not presenting an in
ventory and other accountings of his stew
ardship, as executor, over the estate of
Alexander P. More. The order was made
at the time More was suspended as ex
ecutor and hia sister, Elizabeth Muller,
was appointed srecia 1 administratrix. He
states in his affidavit that Mrs. Muller
took possession of the property on Santa
Rosa Island, began shearing the sheep and
otherwise prevented him from fulfilling
the order of the coart.
An order was made by the court vacat
ing the order of June 23, authorizing the
special administratrix to hypothecate
wool. An order denying a motion to va
cate the order of July 21, authorizing the
special administratrix to sell wool and
some 60,000 mutton sheep.
ELECTRICITY FOR GAS.
Supervisor Hirsch Will Suggest That
This Substitution Be Made on
Foliom Street.
A private letter from the Polsom-street
Improvement Club has been filed with
Alphonse Hirsch of the Street Lighting
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
petitioning his influence in procuring the
substitution of electric lights for gas on
Folsoiu street, "between Nineteenth and
Second.
Mr. Hirsch said yesterday: "I will pre
sent this matter at the next meeting of
the Street Lighting Committee, which oc
curs on September 21. According to the
figures of the Folsom-street Improvement
Club gas is far more expensive than electric
lights wouid be.
"At the same time the cost of removing
the eras lam o posts and putting up the
electric lights wonld amount up seriously.
I am, however, thoroughly in harmony
with the proposition, and shall suggest the
substitution at the next meeting of the
committee."
LIGHTS TO BE SHUT OFF
Gas Inspector Newman Reports
on Many Useless
Lamps.
The City Will Save Several Thousand
Dollars a Year by the
Change.
-\
If the recommendation of Chris New
man, the municipal gas inspector, Is
adopted by the Board of Supervisors the
City will save from $14,000 to $15,000 on its
gas bills within the next two years and
160 useless gas lamps that hare been burn
ing for years past will be dispensed with.
Home time ago the board passed a reso
lution instructing the gas inspector to
look into the matter of gas consumption
and report instances where lamps were
burning in proximity to electric
lights, the idea being to dispense with
those that were not really needed. In
spector Newman has made a thorough
investigation of the matter and the re
sults of his labors were embodied in a re
port rendered to the board yesterday.
He stated in his communication that
from 150 to 160 gas lamps could be shut off
without material darnape, the electric
lights in the different neighborhoods being
amply sufficient to give the necessary
light." In a very, few instances the gas
lamps were 150 to 175 feet from the electric
lights, the laree majority being within
100 feet. The district most affected are
those furthest removed from the center
of population, and the inspector states
that he does not think that the service
will be the least bit the losei.
Eacn one of these lights costs the City
12>Â£ cents per night, Â«nd the saving, in
case the report is accepted, will go far to
eke out the street lieht fund for the next
two years.

SIMPLE PLAN ON PAPER.
Candidates for Congress to Be
Rechosen by the
Fusionists.
BOLSTERING lIP MR. SEWALL.
Populists Throughout the State De-
Clare That They Will Not
Vote for Sewall.
The conference committee from the Peo
ple's party, the Silver party and the
Democrats held a session in the Calirornia
Hotel headquarters yesterday afternoon,
and formulated tin following plan of ac*
tion on the suggestion of John S. Dore.
It will be seen that the plan provides
for the ticking out of George W. Monteith,
Populist candidate for Congress from the
First District, in spite of any claim he may
have on the office, and despite the fact
that a candidate nominated regularly by
his district convention cannot be legally
removed by his State Central Committee
against his consent to suit the pleasure of
a corporation so powerful as is the South
ern Pacific Company.
The following is the full text of the plan
as adopted:
San Francisco, Cal., Aug. 24, 1896.
To the Joint Conference Committee of the Demo
cratic and People's Parties and of the California
Silver Campaign Co-mmitteeâ Gentlemen : Your
sub-committee to whom was assigned the duly
of preparing a plan having in view the union
of the parties- represented in this joint con
ference committee on one candidate for Con
gress In each of the Congressional districts of
California, having considered the same, sub
mit the following:
Whereas, The controlling importance of
united action on the stiver question, the re
funding of the Pacific railroad debts and the
building of the proposed Nicaragua canal (to
the end that the wishes of a large majority of
the people of the State of California may be
obeyed), appeals to the patriotism of the peo
ple of ail parties, and demands the exercise by
them in general, and particularly by those be
longing to the Democratic party, the People's
and silver organizationsâ all of whom agree on
these subjects â of an unselfish devotion to
principle rather than men or parties, and to
the general welfare rather than to spe
cial interests or favorea classes; and
whereas, the omens shadowed across the path
way ot the Republic described by the immor
tal Lincoln when he said: "I see in the near
future a crisis approaching that unnerves me
â¢nd causes me to tremble ior the safety of my
country; as a result of the war corporation's
have been enthroned and an era of corruption
in high places will lollow, and the money
power of the country will endeavor to prolong
its reign by working on the prejudices of the
people until all wealth is aggregated in a few
hands and the Republic is destroyed; I
feel at this moment more anxiety
for the safety of my country than ever
before, even in the midst of the war," are no
longer conjectures, but living dangers. Di
vision of the people's power, as expressed at
the ballot-box, as he feared, has prevented and
will continue to make impossible needed re
forms in methods of administering the fiscal
affairs of the nation and in the readjustment
of the unequal conditions produced by the
legislation of the Republican party, benefit
ting the class interests at the expense of the
masses. Minorities Introduced behind such
laws dictating the financial destiny of the
country have by reason of lack of harmomy
baffled the efforts of a patient people to
secure the free and unlimited coinage of
silver and meet their aspirations to be gov
erned by laws based on the principle of "equal
rights to all and special privileges to none .and
whereas, a large majority of the citizens of
California favor the free coinage of silver, the
building of the proposed Nicaragua canal,
and ate unalterably opposed to the refunding
of the Pacific railroad debts; and whereas,
any course of action by either the Democratic,
the People's or the Silver organization which
will maintain and foster a division of said ma
jority for any cause, personal or other, thereby
inviting defeat, while these important issue's
are hanging in the balance, would in this
crisis be guilty of inexcusable folly and merit
universal contempt; and whereas, the success
of the ifjues so intimately connected with the
general welfare of the Nation, and particularly
affecting the people of our State, not only re
quire the election of Hon. W. J.
Bryan to the Presidency of the United States
but also the election â the election oi a major
ity of the House <A Representatives in the
Fifty-fifth Congress that would support his ad
ministration; aud whereas, by the exercise of
prudent self-sacrifice and in the spirit of mu
tual concession, it is certain that unity of ac
tion will secure a delegation of seven Congress
men from California who will vote as one in
harmony with Mr. Bryan and in favor of the
principles herein enunciated.
In order, therefore, that divisions may be
avoided and that a union may result in each
of our Congressional districts on one candidate
for Congress, and setting aside for the time
being all personal or party differences or pref
erences, do join in the following plan and
recommend its adoption:
In view of the foregoing, it is by the Demo
cratic party, the People's party and the Cali
fornia Silver Campaign Committee, each rep
resented by its duly accredited committee,
Resolved and declared:

which committee shall be called the Joint
Congressional Conference Committee.
111.
That said Joint committee shall not later
than Saturday, August 29, 1896, meet at the
Lick House in the City of San Francisco and
immediately effect an organization.

That said joint committee shall have power
to adopt such rules of procedure calculated to
effect the object of its creation not Inconsistent
with the terms hereof.
V.
That no action taken by such joint commit

of each separate committee composing said
joint committee shall aeree on each candidate
before the joint committee recommends such
union candidate.
VI.
That representation or voting by proxy shall
not be allowed.
vn.
That as soon as said joint committee has
organized, it shall proceed without delay to
carry out the objects of this plan.
VIII.
That all candidates now or hereafter nomi

THE DOG IS SICK.
Judge tow HÂ«t to Continue â  Cm* In
Consequence.
The unusual spectacle of a dog clogging
the wheels of justice was witnessed in
Judge Low's court yesterday morning.
George Thackeray, who lives at 3439
Twenty-second street, owns a valuable
bulldog and John Williams and William
Farrar, his neighbors, are the joint posses
sors of a fine setter dog. One day last
week the setter poked its nose through a
bole in Thackeray's fence and the bulldog
promptly seized the inquisitive nasal ap
pendage of the setter in its deathlike grip.
Williams and Farrar, hearing the howls
of the setter, rushed to its assistance
armed with a cleaver and slashed the bull
dog over the face to make it release its
hold.
Thackeray w&s indignant at the mutila
tion of his bulldog and swore to com
plaints against Williams and Farrar,
charging them with cruelty to animals.
vVhen the case was called yesterday it was
announced that the bulldog was too ill to
appear in court, and the Judge granted a
continuance till such time as it would be
able to make its appearance.

JUDGE CARROLL
WAS INDIGNANT.
An Affidavit in the Cun
ningham Embezzle
ment Case.
THE AFFIANT ARRESTED
Bail Fixed at $2000 to Answer
a Charge of Per
jury.
COUNSEL FOE DEFENDANT.
Explanation That Conlan Was the
Judge to Whom Reference
Was Made.
Justice of the Peace John A. Carroll
was presiding in Judge Conlan's Police
Court Department 2 yesterday morning
when the case of A. A. Cunningham,
charged with embezzlement, was called.
The defendant in the caae is accused of
embezzling money beionging to the
veterinary department of the State Uni
versity.
Last Monday an effort was made to have
the case transferred to Police Judge Low's
court, and the order was about to be
signed before the Judge to whom it was
presented fully comprehended its mean
ing.
Yesterday morning when the case was
called in Department 2, Justice Carroll
presiding, J. K. Johnson, counsel for the
defendant, began to read ta affidavit in
support of a motion for transfer to some
other department. As the reading pro
gressed and the Justice began to under
stand the significance of the charges
made in the affidavit, the court com
manded a louder and more distinct read
ing.
Before the attorney had finished the
readme of the document the Judge in
quired if the defendant, who made the af
fidavit, was in court. Being informed that
Cunningham was present, Justice Carroll
ordered him into custody and directed
the bailiff to take him. From the bench
an order was made to hold Cunningham
in bonds of $2000 to answer the charge of
perjury.
A lawyer associated with J. K. Johnson
sought to explain that the defendant
did not refer in the affidavit to
the Judge then presiding, bnt had
reference to the regular Judge in that
department. Justice Carroll said that he
understood the affidavit. Then he re
peated the order for Cunningham's deten
tion, fixing bail at $2000. The bailiff of
the court then arrested Cunningham and
took him below. The case was continued
until next Monday.
Following is the text of the affidavit
which caused Justice Carroll to make the
order for Cunningham's arrest:
A. A. "Cunningham, being duly sworn, de
poses and says that he is the defendant in the
above-entitled cause; that he has reason 4 to be
lieve and does believe that he cannot have a
fair aud impartial trial before the Judge pre
siding in the court who is about to try the case
by reason of the prejudice and bias of said
Judge; that said bias and prejudice consists in
part as follows: This affiant is informed and
believes, and therefore upon his information
and belief states, that said Judge is a personal
friend of the prosecuting witness and that
both are members of the same order or so
ciety; that affiant was arrested on
July 28, 1896; that at his request
the case was set. for trial on or about Tuesday,
August 14, 1896; that ever since said day de
fendant has been ready and anxious to try
said cause, but against his will and consent
the cause has been continued from time to
time, but said cause came up on Thursday,
August 20, 1896, for trial; that defendant
was ready and demanded that the cause be
tried; that against his objection the cause was
continued until Tuesday, August 25 ; that all
of said continuances have been ordered
by the Judge without any legal show
ing or reason therefor being shown or
given by the prosecution; that the
whole course of said Judge in relation
to the continuance of said cause has tended to
and actually has worked great hardship and
injustice upon defendant, and has amounted
to a partial denial of justice; that during the
consideration of said cause relating to de
fendant's urgent request for immediate trial
the prosecuting attorney engaged In a whis
pered conversation with said Judge, where
upon without assigning any reason therefor
the Judge ordered the cause continued.
Justice of the Peace Carroll is very in
dignant over the allegations in Cunning
ham's affidavit that he belongs to the
same order as tbe prosecuting witness.
Justice Carroll emphatically denied the
allegation and intimated that he would in
all probability swear to a complaint this
morning charging Cunningham with per
jury.
Judge Belcher accepted a bond in $500
for Cunningham's release late yesterday
afternoon and he was set at liberty.
THE HORSES RAN AWAY,
Rare Presence of Mind Displayed
by Father Powers of
Livermore.
Be Stops the Horses in a Patrol
Wagon and Prevents a Very
Serious Accident.
. The horses attached to the Southern
Btat ion patrol wagon bolted at Eighth and
Mission streets yesterday afternoon and,
but for the presence of mind of Rev.
Father Powers of Livermore, a serious ac
cident would have resulted.
About 1 o'clock there was a call for the
waeon to go to 108 Sixth street. Mrs. Van
de Bogart, the wife of policeman Van de
Bogart, had fallen downstairs and frac
tured her nose, cut her forehead and other
wise injured herself.
Policemen Galloway and Beach accom
panied the wagon and they put the woman
on the stretcher and started for the .Re
ceiving Hospital. At Eighth and Mission
streets, tbe driver, Henry Carlson, made a
stiarp turn to avoid colliding with i pass
ing team and one of the wheels went over
a large cobble-stone. The sudden lurch to
the side threw Carlson from his seat and
the horses took fright and dashed north
on Eighth street.
Carlson had the reins in his hands
and clung to them while being dragged
along the street for about fifty yards,
when he had to let go. Pol'cemen Gallo
way end Beach climbed to the front of the
wagon in the hope that they might get a
hold on the reins, but as the reins were
trailing on the ground they were helpless.
The horses dashed across Market street
and evidently knew where ti ey were
going, as they turned into City Hall
avenue and made for the hospital.
Father Powers was standing on the
corner of the two avenues talking to City
and County Attorney Creswefi. The
horses were making straight for' the
coping in front of the hospital and a
serious accident was imminent when
Fa- tier Powers, with rare presence of
mind, seized a cane from a bystander and
just as the maddened animals were pass
ing him he dealt the one nearest him a
blow on the nostrils with the cane. The
horse swerved and fell and its companion
instantly stopped. The two policemen
jumped from the wagon and seized the
horses by their bridles and all danger was
over.
All the time Mrs. Van de Bogart lay
comfortably on the stretcher and was un
aware of the fact that the horses had run
away. Driver Carlson had his left arm
sprained and was lucky to escape so
easily.
DESERTED IN INFANCY.
A Little Colored Girl Abandoned by
Her Heartless Mother to the Mer
cies of the World.
Two colored women brought a three
year-old colored girl to the office of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children yesterday afternoon. The little
one was evidently in very poor health
and seemed to realize already that the
world is a severe school, for her bright,
bead-like eyes were heavy with weeping.
The women said that the child's mother,
who goes by the name of Brown, deserted
the child about two weeks ago, since
which time the hapless wait has knocked
about from room to room in a Third-street
lodging-house. The surroundings were
not adapted for the proper raising of the
child, and the women requested the society
to place her in some institution. The
little girl was sent to the Children's Hos
pital for the medical aid which she evi
dently needs.

TWO CHINESSE BABIES.
Taken From a Disreputable House to
the Methodist Mission. â¢
Secretary Welch and Frank Holbrook of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
of Children, ana Officer McMurray and
Mrs. I. A. Hull of the Chinese Methodist
Mission, made a ra d on the Chinese
bouses of ill repute in Chinatown last
evening in search of young girls. In a
house in Ross alley the party found sev
eral women, and in the rear of the house
was a mother and her two little babies,
one about 18 months and the other about
8 months of age.
Mrs. Hull decided that the surroundings
were not the best for the babies, and with
the officers she seized the little ones and
hurried off to the mission on Washington
and Stone streets. The mother was frantic
and ran screaming after those who had
taken away her babies, but she was thrust
back again and again. At the mission
door the poor creature raised such a dis
turbance that the police arrested her for
Keeping minors in a disreputable house,
and she was locked up in the California
street police station. The ladies of the
mission congratulated themselves upon
their success in rescuing the children.
MORE LOW GRAIN RATES
Will Be Put Into Operation on
Additional Valley Road
Points.
Passenger Service to Be Deferred
Till the Fresno Troubles
Are Settled.
Additional grain rates will be put in
effect to-day by the Valley road. They
will corer the four stations for which
class rates were issued Saturday last, and
also Patterson, five miles south of Lan
kersbim. No class has or will be issued
for Patterson, as grain is the only com
modity that will come from there at
present.
In addition to these rates for new points
two reduced rates will be announced to
day from old stations. The grain rate
from Burnham to Stockton will be re
duced from 60 cents to 50 cents per ton in
carload lots of 24,000 pounds, and that
from Escaion from 90 cents to 80 cents. To
San Francisco the rate from each of these
points will be 50 cents higher.
These reductions have been made to
meet teaming competition. It was found
that the existing rates from the two points
named did not secure the business, and it
is hoped that the new rates will throw thÂ«
hauling from the points named to Stock
ton into the hands of the railroad. The
Southern Pacinc Company will meet these
reductions and issue all their reduced rates
to-day, though they are already meeting
the low rates of the Valley road.*
The additional rates to be issued to-day
are for grain in carload lots of not less
than 24,000 pounds. They are as follows:

At tne meeting of the board of directors
of the Valley roeid yesterday it was de
cided to issne the call for tbe last 10 per
cent of the sr ascribed stock. This will
return somett ng over $240,000 and will be
used to complete the road to Fresno, to
erect stations along the line, to ballast the
road with gravel, to pay for tbe*passenger
coaches which are expected to arrive in
about three weeks, and to finish sidetracks
and other work necessary to place the
road in tirst-class operation.
The road will not be opened for passen

settled and the road is completed to that
city.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1896.
WILLIAMS HAD
PLENTY OF COIN,
Bank Books Show a Won
derful Saving in a
Short Period.
OVER $12,000 INVOLVED.
Principal Business Was Trans
acted With the Hibernia
Savings Society.
NO CHANGING OF ACCOUNTS.
Tke Ex-Chinese Inspector Is Also
Said to Own Real Estate Worth
at Least $15,000.
If Barclay Henley and Assistant United
States Attorney Schlessinger had suc
ceeded in getting all of Dick Williams'
banking business before the jury it is
probable that the attorneys of the ex-In
spector would have figuratively thrown up
the sponee and incidentally sought the
clemency of the court for their client.
From the time of his appointment as
Inspector, October, 1893, to April oi the
Defendant Williams and His Daughter Interested in the Proceedings.
current year, Williams deposited in two
local banks no less than from $12,000 and
$15,000. His salary during this period
amounted to $3900. It is to be presumed,
of course, that Williams spent something
for household expenses, hence the proba
bility of him having speculated and saved
$15,000 out of the remainder of his salary
iB not to be seriously considered, except as
a contingent possibility.
At the trial yes terday the court allowe d
something like $4100 of deposits to be ad
mitted as testimony. This is scarcely
one-third of the sum actually placed by
Wiiliams in the bank, through his wife,
durlne the two and a half years he served
as Chinese Inspector. The deposits in the
Hibernia Savin scs and Loan Society from
October 19, 1893, to April 13. 1896, ex
clusive of interest, were as follows:
1803â 1894-
Octoberl9 $100 October 11 200

It will be observed that within a period
of two and a ha'f years Williams placed
to his credit in one bank alone $10,000,
lacking $389 95. Of this sum $4050 was de
posited in 1895. The largest single credit,
$1400, was in April of this year, Decem ber
of 1895 beuig next on the list with $1000.
From $100? October 19, 1893, to $1400 April
13, 1896. was apparently an easy jump for
the ex-Inspector. At first he went along
in sums of $60, $7U and $100, but at no time
since November 7, 1893, did he find it
necessary to go below the latter sum.
Incidentally it may be remarked that this
account was in tbe name of his wife, Mrs.
Isabella M. Williams, though the ex-
Insnector has since sworn that all the
money named above was his own.
It seems, however, that Williams had
another account with the Hibernia Bank
prior to October, 1893. His bankbook
shows that on September 11. 1891, Mrs.
Williams deposited $200, but the same was
checked out before tbe end of the year.
Again in April of 1893 a credit is noted of
$100, but this was also withdrawn at the
end of a few weeks. It was not until Octo
ber of the same year that Williams opened
a regular account, which he continued un
til the investigation, which has resulted in
the present trial for extortion, was com
menced.
In addition to the Hibernia account Wil
liams had dealings with the San Francisco
Savings Union to the extent of, probably,
$5000. A bankbook was introduced yes
terday showing deposits to the extent of
$3000, and there is said to be another
account of from $2000 to $3000.
From the bankbooks actually pro
duced in court Williams deposited no less
than $12,910 05. How much, if any, of
this was taken from one bank to another
is not known, but on the face the accounts
appear to be separate.
in addition to this large amount of cash
Williams is said to be possessed of real
estate worth $15,000. It is not presumed,
however, that the court will allow this to
be introduced.
THE WILLIAMS TRIAL.
Testimony of Various witnesses for
The Prosecution.
At the opening of the morning session of
tbe William j case before Judge Morrow W.
H. Van Pelt, an attorney, testified that in
1893 Williams had said to him that it would
be a godsend if he (Williams) could secure
an appointment as inspector in the Custom
house.
Colonel J. J. Tbbin of the Custom-house
(recalled) testified that during the absence
of Collector "Wise last year Williams had
requested to be permitted to attend to the
landing of all Chinese women.
Washington Irving, a watchman in
Chinatown, gave some unimportant testi
mony concerning his acquaintance with
defendant.
Daniel Einstein, a builder, and Patrick
Filssimrnons, a contractor, testified to the
purchase of a house by Williams, and its
subsequent conveyance to a relative, to
avoid trouble with tbe Government. The
testimony of one of the witnesses was
ruled out. An affidavit made by defend
ant in June last shows that when he en
tered the customs service in September,
1893, he was not impecunious, but pos
sessed several thousand dollars. There
was also some testimony, previously
noted, of Williams' banking transactions.
The case for the Government was then
rested and the taking of testimony for the
defense will begin this morning.

STRONG TALK FOR GOLD
Colrnel John P. Irish and Ed
ward F. Adams Debate
on Finance.
E cqtrnt Addresses Made in Defense
of the Yellow and White
Metals.
Colonel John P. Irish and Edward F.
Adams discussed the financial question
last evening at the Howard-street Metho
dist Church under the auspices of the Po
litical Economy Club of the South Park
settlement, President Bernard Moses pre
siding.
Mr. Adams was the first speaker and
treated the subject in the light of the de
sirability of finding an honest dollar.
"The whole argument," said he, "cen
ters around this point, 'the honest dollar.'
Money has thr.ee functionsâ first, as a
medium of exchange; second, as a meas
ure of value in cash transactions, and
last as a measure of value in deferred pay
ments. The latter function is tbe most
important."
The justness of the present gold dollar
as a standard for deferred payments he
described as being the only monetary
question that interests tbe people.
He said that nothing was stable in
value with reference to anything else. He
said that a panic would probably follow on
the fixing of silver as a standard, but it
would follow anyway. He was a bimetal
list, but if we cannot have two motais then
he was for silver.
Colonel John P. Irish sÂ»ld: "I think it
ia difficult to separate the functions of
money. The most important function, to
my mind, is as a medium of exchange.
"Law and practice ami nu.ure divided
property into two divisions, fixable and
movable. The exchange netween these is
termed commerce.
"What elements do we seek in this form
of personal property called money? We
desire the element of stability. Reading
the history of the evolution of money it
will be seen that man was instigated by the
motive of personal selection to procure a
medium of ui.iversa\ stability.
"Mr. Adams says told fluctuates. But
if we indict and condemn gold because it
fluctuates what are we to do when we
propose to use as a medium of deferred
payments the perishable products of
commerce? These fluctuations in the
perishable products that constitute the
articles of commerce are continual.
"My Irieni'd proposition is to virtually
do away with both iioin and silver because
they both fluctuate as do r>priÂ«hable prod
ucts, and he proposes to make these prod
ucts the real medium of exchange in the
face of flood and famine."

CLEMENTS DIED IN
AN INSANE WARD,
His Friends Think That
Some One May Be
to Blame.
STRUCK BY A LUNATIC.
His Skull Was Fatally Crushed
by One Terrific
Blow.
WAS A PROMINENT FORESTER.
At One Time He Was a Past Chief
Ranger of Court Eclipse No.
14 of This City.
Owen Clements, who was killed in the
State Asylum for the Insane at Stockton
Wednesday by a madman, was a promi
nent member of the Order of Foresters of
America, being a past chief rauger of
Court Eclipse No. 14 of this City. He was
a well-known citizen of San Francisco,
having been a contractor for a period of
several years here. He acquired prop
erty in South San Francisco and also
owned some real estate in the Richmond
district. The account of his death, as it
has been transmitted in press dispatches
from Stockton, has aroused keen anger in
the minds of his friends, who are many,
and one at least has already raised bis
protest against what, in his opinion, is a
system of carelessness which, to say the
least, is unwarranted, in view especially
of the fate that has befallen Mr. Clements.
The press dispatches say that Clements,
who was an inmate of the asylum, was
killed by a madman named Carl Gustaf
sen, who was known to be very crazy and,
therefore, supposedly very dangerous.
Gustafsen, according to the same account,
was engaged in scrubbing a floor in the asy
lum, having in nis band a board affair,
which was quite heavy. Clements came
along while Gustafsen was at his work and
kicked the dangerous lunatic on the shins.
Gustafsen thereupon raised the scrubbing
apparatus and brought it down with great
force upon the head df Clements, who fell
to the floor like a log. His skull was frac
turad and he died not many hours after
the occurrence.
Among those who knew Mr. Clements
very well was I. Irvine, who lives at 64
Tehama street. Mr. Irvine has written a
communication in which he says that "it
is very strange that the lunatics in the
State asylum should be allowed to posses
and use clubs or implements which may
be employed as clubs." Mr. Irvine also
expressed the decided wish in his com
munication "that some competent person
may take this matter in hand and fully
investigate the case of Mr. Clements. That
this will be done is hoped by his friends."
During a period of several years Owen
Clements lodged at Mrs. Ault's house at
64 Tehama street. He told Mrs. Ault that
he came here from Lowell, Mass., and
OWEN CLEMENTS.
that he had been formerly in business as
a contractor in Lowell, which was the
same line undertaken by him when he ar
rived in San Francisco.
He was a mild-mannered gentleman
when he lodged at Mrs. Ault's, according
to what Mrs. Ault and her two daughters
say. He lj.ved at 64 Tehama street some
thing like six years or perhaps a little

J/ CAUTION : None genuine without the signature of V

longer. He removed to the corner of
Clement street and Eighth avenue, in the
Richmond district, something like two
years ago, and resided there until last Sep
tember or October, when he wa3 adjudged
to be insane and was committed to the
State Asylum for the Insane at Stockton
upon the order of Judge Low.
From all that his friends in the City
have been able to learn about the case,
Mr. Clements was not considered a dan
gerous patient at Stockton. They have i
no positive information on that point,
however. The dispatches say that he had
been in the habit of .kicking the patients
on the shins at tne asylum at Stockton,
which was the offense that caused Gustaf
sen to strike him with fatal result.
They say that even if he was a danger
ous patient that is no reason why he
should have been allowed to have fallen
into the danger which has cost him his
life, and that if he was not a dangerous
patient he ought not to have been in the
company of Gustafson. They admit at
the same time that they know compara
tively few of the facts. Such facts as they
know only have tended to arouse their
indignation and to stimulate their desire
to have all of the particulars carefully
looked into.
Mr. Clements was still quite young, be
ing aged 43 years. He was a bachelor,
without relatives in the United States so
far as is known by his friends in this City.
He has a brother in Ireland of whom he
often spoke, and he was reported by
Mr. Clements to intend to come soon to
this country and possibly to San Fran
cisco to reside.
Mr. Clements was somewhat quiet and
reserved in his lodgings, and this is about
all the information that he furnished con
cerning his family connections. No re
sponsibility is attached to Gusiafsen, who
was tbe cause of Mr. Clements' death, as a
matter of course.
Daniel Sullivan, an old friend of Mr.
Clements', has gone to Stockton and
! will probably make arrangements to bring
I the remains to this City for interment. It
is also probable that some action may oe
taken by the members of Court Eclipse
No. 14 of the Order of American Foresters
to pay fitting respect, and they may take
other action. Very likely Daniel Sullivan
may inquire particularly at Stockton con
cerning Mr. Clements' death. He is ex
pected back to-day or Monday. Yester
day he was not at his place of business on
Mission street, having gone to Stockton as
soon as possible after he heard of the de
mise of Mr. Clements. Theiwo men have
been friends for years. Some interest will
attach to what Mr. Sullivan may say upon
his return. __^^_____^___

ited even a shade higher percentage, all of
which conclusively establishes the truth
of the theory that at least 75 per cent of

TALBOT'S SUCCESSOR.
Will Probably Be Named by a Special
Civil Service Com.
-â  mission.
There is somewhat of a muddle in the
ocal Hulls and Boilers office as to the
method to be adopted in selecting a suc
cessor to the late Captain Talbot, inspector
of hulls. In times gone by it has been cus
tomary for the Supervising Inspector,
District Judge and Collector of the Port to
agree on a man and then submit the same
to the Secretary of the Treasury.
Shortly after Captain Talbot's death
however, the Civil Service Commissioners
claimed the right to order an examination
for the office and notified the Secretary of
the Treasury to that effect. The point
was conceded at the time, but later tha
department reviewed the case and, accord
ing to the latest information, has thrown
the appointment back on the old board.
On Saturday last the following telegram
was received :
Washington, D. C,, Aug. 21, 1896
Supervising Inspector Steam Vessels, San Fran
cisco, Ca\: Orders have been issued for Doard
of designators to convene.
C. S. Hamlin, Acting Secretary.
"This telegram," said Captain Berming
ham yesterday, "contains all that I know
about the matter. It may be that the
ornce is not under civil service, which
means that the old plan will be followed.
On the other hand, it is possible that the
â treasury Department intends to appoint
the old board as a special Civil Service
Oonimiasion, or that we are simply to
name three men, who will then be notified
to appear before the regular commission.
1 cannot say anything definite, however,
until the instructions referred to in the
telegram are received."
About Chickens.
Patrick Lynn lives at 227 Duncan street and
Patrick Carroil at Duncan and Dolores streets.
Lynn is the possessor of some valuable chick
ens and he blamed Carroll with casting anxious
eyes upon them and endeavoring to entice
them away from his yard. Carroll heard of
this, and when he met Lynn on Monday he
gave him a pair of beautiiul black eyes. Lynn
swore to a complaint in Juage Joachimsen's
court yesterday, charging Carroll with bat
tery.

The Fish Couimissioners will have a fine dig

1. Large consignments of fish have been re
ceived from San Diego County and Lake Ta

the supply oi water at the Pavilion is short,
the managers of the exposition having failed

A BURGLAR UNDER THE BED.
How a Woman's Nerve and Quick Wit
Effected His Capture.
A young Philadelphia woman of rather
graceful, dignified appearance, about 25,
had become infatuated with histrionic art.
She was of excellent family, of wealth,
and had a thoroughly musical education
at home and in Paris, says the Philadel
phia Telegraph. To become a celebrated
songstress was the dream of her existence,
and when an opportunity occurred for her
to display her vocal powers on the boards
this young woman seized it rapturously,
and, in defiance of her parents' wishes,
joined an amateur theatrical company.
The company was to remain in Toledo,
Ohio, only a few days, and then go farther
West The young woman to whom I have
reference had a magnificent set of dia
monds, worth thousands of dollars, and,
of course, she took those with her, and
also a large sum of money. One of the
members of the company, who had taken
quarters at the hotel with the others,
suggested that Miss S deposit the
money and jewels in the safe, but Miss
6 refused to act upon this suggestion.
It was nearly 12 o'cloctr. of the evening
of her arrival at the hotel, and going up to
her room on returning from tne opera,
where she had gone with some young
people, Miss S was about to ring for
her maid, when she saw through the mir
ror facing her a reflection of a men's boot
and also a hand clasping an ugly-looking
knife, protruding from under the bed. A
scream was ready to burst from her throat,
but by a superhuman effort she controlled
it and commenced humming snatches of
an opera, at the same lime thinking of a
clever plan to save both herselt and
diamonds; stopping suddenly in the
midst of her singing she said aloud:
"There, I left all my money in the office
safe and haven't a penny for that bill; I'll
send Marie for it." And ringing a bell,
waited witn bated breath the maid's ap-
Dearance. The two minutes that elapsed
seemed like two years.
"Marie," sire said calmly, as that indi
vidual came into the room, "go down to
the office and bring up all my money left
there this morning â here, I'll write you
an order for it," and taking a card wrote:
"Burglars hiding in my room; come at
once with help" â and, slipping it in an en
velope, sealed it. "Give this to the pro
prietor," she continued, "and he will give
you the money."
Miss S â â again looked at the bedside to
see if the foot and hand remained visible
no, they had been withdrawn; then, walk
ing over to the piano, she began to sing.
A knock at the door was heard. "Come
in," she answered, almost holding her
breath for fear her note had failed in its
mission, but noâ there stood the hotel pro
prietor and by his side two policemen.
They immediately looked under the bed
where Miss S was pointing with a
highly dramatic gesture, and captured the
burglar without any trouble.
A Curious Balloon Experiment.
An interesting scientific experiment was
made recently in Paris with the aid of a
balloon which was sent up from Villette
at 10:30 o'clock. The object of the experi
ment was to collect a quantity of the at
mosphere at a very great altitude for pur
poses of analysis. The balloon was, there
fore, sent up alone witu the necessary in
struments attached to it. These consisted
of an entirely new kind of reservoir capa
ble of holding six liters of air. To this was
attached a spiral arrangement terminating
in a tap hermetically sealed, but so ar
ranged with a clockwork apparatus that it
would open just one hour after the ascent
and close again one minute later. A good
deal of in.enuity had been displayed in
this invention. In order to pre-erve the
reservoir from the intense cold of the
upper regions, it was surrounded by a
bath of sodawater, which was expected to
keep the apparatus at an even tempera
ture. In addition the balloon also carried
two b&rc-therniogranhs for registration
purposes at high altitudes. Attached to
the balloon are instructions to those who
may find it so that it may be carefully
wrapped up and forwarded to Paris forth
with. â Westminster Gazette.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1896.
TO FIGHT FOR
THE GLOBE HOTEL
Madison & Burke Will
Prepare to Resist Its
Demolition.
WAS ERECTED IN 1860.
Incident of the Original Lease
to the Chinese
Tenants.
THE EESTJLT WAS DISASTEOTJS,
Building Was Planned for the Enter
tainment of German
Guests-
The Board of Health has condemned
the old Globe Hotel building, which
stands at the northwest corner of Jackson
and Dupont streets, but if tbe Health
Officer attempts demolition of the inte
rior walls he will be restrained by pro-
ceedines in court until the constitution
ality of the law is tented.
Madison & Burke, the agents cf the
owner, said yesterday:
"Five years ago we expended $1500 in
plumbing repairs to this house. We took
out old pipe and put in new. We stand
ready now to ooey the demand of the
Board of Health to improve the sanitary
condition of the premise?, but if an at
tempt shall be made to tear out the inte
rior we shall resist it in court. There are
many places south of Market street where
the sanitary conditions are much worse
than those at the Globe Hotel. We have
the advice of able lawyers that the Board
of Health cannot destroy this property.
We lease the property to a number of
tenants. Under the law each tenant must
be notified that the sanitary condition is
defective." â¢
The Globe Hotel was erected in 1860, by
a German named Schaeffer, who had a
great ambition to own and maintain a fine
house for the entertainment of German
guests. He ba<i kept a small hotel or
tavern on the premises for several years
prior to 1860, and thus acquired a good
patronage, especially among the Germans.
At that time the Tehatna House and the
Oriental Hotel received the cream of the
American patronage, and Schaeffer de
cided to build an inn worthy of his Ger
man friends. The bricks used in the con
Â£QW OB v GQKQEHtUEP HOUSES ON JQVPONT ST. BEET.
struction of the bouse were made at the
brickyard of the Buckleys, then on Larkiu
street, near Pacific. It is said that the
granite came from China. To-day there
is ample evidence of superior construction
in the outer walls and foundation.
Among some af the old-timers the story
goes that Schaeffer died while building
operations were in progress, and the execu
tors of his estate finished the work and
leased the hotel to two Germans. At tbat
time only a few Chinese had settled in San
Francisco, but some years later a Chinese
company offered $1400 a month for the
premises. The Germans holding the lease
were only paying $900 a month, so the
executors ousted them and made a lease
to the Mongolians. The house was im
mediately tilled throughout with Chinese.
The rent was paid all right for the first
month, but when the next month's rent
became due no officers of the Chinese
company could be found. The Chinese
were in and there was no way to get them
out except by tedious process of law.
Finally a settlement was effected, but tbe
amount received was much less than the
German tenants had been paying.
Another version of the Globe Hotel's
history is that the builder, Scbaeffer, com
mitted suicide in the saloon of the hotel
in 1861. That version is accepted as tbe
true one at Madison & Burkes office. Sub
sequently the executors of the estate sold
the property to Costar and the latter
leased the premises to the Chinese. Tbe
building now stands in the name of F. E.
HesthaJ.
In due time the truth will probably be
evolved from the3e conflicting traditions
by Al Knieht of the SatherUanking Com
pany, who is collecting historical data and
ancient photographs relating to this City.
He has access to many valuable scrap
books in the possession of old-timers.
George T. Knox, the notary, James Gabb
and Joseph M. Shotwell, manager of the
Merchants' Exchange, have distinct recol
lections of the construction of the Globe
Hotel. Mr. Shotwell lived in that locality
before the Chinese were there. The
"Glob " was regarded as a gieat acquisi
tion to that quarter of the City. It was a
conspicuous edifice on account of its
height and solidity. Many Germans hold
ing high positions in the community
patronized the hotel, although the house
never had the prestige of fashion which
the Tehama and Oriental acquired.
WERE NOT ORDERED.
Cornelias O'Connor < Declaim* â  Rupert
Schmid'g Modifications to the
'Grant Memorial.
Referring to the threatened lawsuit be
tween Rupert Scbraid, the sculptor, and
the Grant memorial committee Cornelius
O'Connor stated yesterday that no modifi
cation had been made with the consent or
knowledge of the committee. /.â¢
"All that we expectadito be done was
stated in the contract and Mr. 1 Schmidt
had no authority to make modifications,"
he said. "We know nothing of any changes
in the design and are: only called upon to i
pay according to the contract." ;
Mr. O'Connor stated also: that the fund
is not exhausted, but that the. committee
does not feel justified in paying added
bills that ; the sculptor may choose to
send in. â¢ ' 'V " . : ;

SPEEDING EASTWARD
ON FLYING WHEELS
Spreading a Speedy Streak
From the Pacific to
the Atlantic.
START MADE AT NOON.
Riders Will Know No Rest for
Three Thousand Five Hun
dred Miles.
THE RUX TO SACEAMENTO.
The Examiner-Journal Great Trans*
continental Relay Race From
Shore to Shore.
The transcontinental bicycle relay race
arranged by the Examiner and the New
York Journal went off at the discharge of
a pistol exactly at noon yesterday, from a
black line drawn across Market street at
Grant avenue. An immense crowd wit
nessed the start.
The first relay, down Market street to the
foot of Howard, was ridden by little
Clotilde and George Devany on their tan
dem, on which they have been seen so
often in Golden Gate Pane. Little Miss
Clotilde carried the packet containing the
messace from the War Department to the
general commanding the Department of
the East in New York. They made the
distance 10 the foot of Howard street in
four and a half minutes, accompanied by
a large escort of wheelmen. There the
pacKet was taken across the bay on a tug,
and, arriving there, the relay-riaing from
San Francisco to New York began in ear
nest. The War Department messa_e is
inscribed on a plate of cold. The general
in New York will receive at the office of
the Journal.
The relay race will be run to make the
best time possible. It is a race against
time. It will be an admirable test of the
practicability of the use of the wheel by
long-distance couriers. A Nation will
watch it as it speeds from the Golden
Gate to the Bartholdi Statue. It is an
event and a trial of speed and skill of
more than National interest, this flashing
of wheels over mountains and valleys,
rivers and roads that rib and furrow a
continent.
Thera will be no rest either by day or
night. Snowsheds and iorests will be
penetrated in the dark and the desert will
be passed almost as swiftly as it flashes by
the windows of a car. The packet will be
exchanged at the end ot each relay while
the riders are at full speed. It is intended
to l.aye the Governor of each State sign
an attest of the presence of the relay rider.
The swiitest road riders and racers have
been enlisted in the effort to make the
best time possible from the Pacific to the
Atlantic. The schedule of relays siows
that the 140 miles to bacramento is only a
matter of seven hours and fifty-nine min
utes, and this gives an idea of the speed
that the race will attempt to maintain un
til t ii e last swift rider dismounts at the
end of the last relay.
At Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 25.â Walter
Leitch brought the packet message to
Tenth and M streets to-night at 8:27,
making his relay of six miles in siow time.
Leitch broke his wlieel at the start and
was obliged to take that of his trailer.
He was in an exhausted condition when
he arrived and was aimost carried into the
Capitol building, where the papers were
signed by*the Governor's private becretary
and the postmaster of Sacramento and de
livered to Jakie Hirsch, who left at 8:31.
A crowd of over 1000 people obstructed
the street and the start was necessarily
sJow.
Dropped Dead on the Street.
Anthony Wanner of the contracting ffrm of
Wanuer & Maddox dropped dead yesterday
afternoon on the corner of Powell ami Market
streets. The deceased lived at 121 Ridley
street and leaves r family.

PICK THEWINNER

It is easy to pick the winner in this
match. On the one hand is manly strength,
nealtn and condition, while on the
other is \ evident < weakness, r loss Â» of â¢ flesh
and the appearance ]of wasted vita! force.
It is easy to tell who , will win. .'So it is in
the e very-day ,. battle \of life; the strong
man is always to the fore, full of vim,
push and energy. Success is always his.'
In these days of business failure men need
nerve power; every man needs some
building up.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT

up of manly vigor. It charges the neryo-
muscular ' and ; other organs J ; daily with
strong vital force, which renews their vig-
orous power. y lt -: checks .all .-: unnatural
waste of power in two weeks, restores
confidence . and makes â  manhood perfect.
It is the basis of all manly vigor. , ,' ;

wag a sufferer from weakness, which debilitated
me tc a great extent, and sup to : the ; time i I

Explanation^
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
It station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, ot melted snow in inches and hundredtlis,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lin-s. connect poms of equal air pressure; iÂ«o
-therm*, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh"' means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low" â ,
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded 1
and accompanied by clondy weather and raini.
"Lows" nsi. ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the press are is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable; 1
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars ol
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warrnei
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 25.â Stock market
movements to-day, as of late, were dull and unin
teresting; the sales were even smaller than on
yesterday, footing up only 94,295 shares, the deal
ings in railway and miscellaneous mortgages,
however, showing a slight increase, aggregating
a little over $400,000. Stocks started off weak,
but the declining tendency was checked by the
announcement that the steamer Teutonic, sailing
from Liverpool to-morrow, will take out $500,000
in gold, consigned to a New York firm, and by a
furihei decline of yjc in tne posted rates of ster
ling exchange. Ihe fact that there has been no
necessity to issue Clearing-bouse loan certificates
as yet and that one of the city banks was the
heaviest lender of money on call to-day assisted
the rec very in prices. The bank In question was
the first to suggest tbe issuance of loan certificates j
and made the application simply for the purpose
of assisiing other institutions In case of need. The
corporation is one of the strongest downtown.
In rcard to gold imports it was stated that tbe
banks and the foreigu exchange syndicate had de
cided to bring $2U,000,000 of the metal from
turope. This report first gained currency when
the banks first restored the Treasury reserve to the
hundred-million mark some weeks ago, and was
denied at that Lime. There has been no new de
velopments since, although it is believed that 1
movements of gold to this country will continue
lor at least a month or six weeks longer. Near !
the close the early rise of yÂ± to % per cent was
lost and report had it that McKinley's letter of ac
ceptance would give more prominence to tariff
than was generally looked tor here. This hud
some influence in certain quarters and accounts
for the reactionary tendency. The selling was of
light proportions and the impression on values ln
sig.iilicuiiL.
Speculation closed weak. Net changes show
losses oi i/i^l per cent. Western I tuon and
bugar made slight gains. In the specialties Min
nesota Iron declined 3 to 47 and Illinois Steel 2 to
40.

CHICAGO AIAIIK.KT4.
CHICAGO, Ij;u, Aug. 25.â Stronger cables were
received from Liverpool and Berlin this morning,
and as they did not accord with the final tone of
our market of yesterday wheat opened firm In re
sponse to the Independence of the foreign trade.
It required something more than the Influence
mentioned to sustain prices, however, and nothing
possessing the proper - merit of value as | a ball ar
gument being received the market ' soon gave way
to moderate selling. Later the announcement of
Brads treet's report giving an â  increase in the
world's stocks of 31 9,000 bushels induced further
weakness. Receipts at Chicago were 306 cars,
and 126,300 bushels were taken from store. The
Northwest had 654 cars against 448 last Monday
and 106 Â« a year ago. " Export clearances were fair
at 275,032 bushels- Closing Paris cables reported
a decline in liour of 2.1 centimes and in wheat of
6to 20 centimes- Antwerp was unchanged, and
Berlin closed 2VÂ» marks higher. December wheat
opened from 6iy 3 c to 618/gC declined tosy%@
tsuc, closing at 6OV4C, %c under yesterday. Esti
mated receipts lor 10-morrow 110 cars.
CORNâ Varied a little if any from the position it
has held for some days. There were reasonably a
few fluctuations, but they were of no particular
consequence, and denoted no material change In
the situation. These slight alterations in prices
were brought about through the medium 01 wheat.
Receipts were 721 cars, and 276,030 bushels were
withdrawn from store. Liverpool cables were 14 d
lower. Hradstreei's reported a decline in stocks of
838,000 bushels. Export clearances amounted to
184.503. May corn 01 ened at J6V2@ a *'% c < de
clined to 25%@-6c. closing at 26c, %We un ler
yesterday. .Estimated receipts for 10-morrow 370
cats.
OATSâ A quiet trade, without special feature or
important happening, was noted in oats. - From
lack of independent motive the tone was more or
less the result 01 sympathy with the greater mar
kets. Receipts were 504 cars, aud 71.628 bushels
were taken from store. Bradstreet's gave a de
crease in stocks of 248,00 d bushels. May oats
closed 6/jjc under yesterday. Estimated receiptr
for to-morrow, 210 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash Northwestern and
Southwestern, 6; VbÂ°: September, 680: December,
. lViÂ®>7l Vjc. Receipts were 94 cars.
S PROVISIONSâ The provision market was al
most a perfunctory affair, the trade having no ele
ments of interest. A fractional advance over last
night's close at the opening was caused by a
slightly firmer hog market, but later the disposi
tion manifested was to sell, and under the pressure
a new record of low prices was established. Janu
! ary pork clo-ed 7y @ioc lower; January lard, lUÂ®
12"i/Â«jc lower, and January ribs, a shade lower.

Editor High's Second Libel
Suit on Trial
To-Day.
SAYS HE FEARS NOTHING
The Real Ownership of the
Times the Chief Point
Involved.
NOT DOWNED BY DINGEE.
The Ex-Editor Got Rid of His Prop
erty to Avoid the Possibility
of Bankruptcy.
Oakland Omci Fan Francisco Call,/
908 Broadway^ Aue. 25. )
There is as much interest being shown
in the change of ownership in the Times
as in a municipal campaign. The mere
fact that a paper that has sunk over $30,000
in five years should revert to the banks
which have owned it for a long time is not
veiy remarkable, but the position of Mr.
Dlsgee, the president of the Oakland
Water Company, who has been abused
by ex-Editor High, invests to-morrow's
trial with marked interest.
Bat neither Mr. Dingee nor Mr. High
is the central figure in the trial, which
will surely be a sensational one. Develop
ments have shown that Mr. High never
really owned the paper, and the purpose
of Mr. Dingee will bs to show that Mr.
High is only partially liable for the
articles to which Mr. Dingee objects.
The methods of the capitalists of Oak
land are about as generally interesting as
those of politicians, and when they fall
out there is likely to be as much
uneasiness.
"It was reported that Mr. Dingee had
bought the Times so as to close me up,"
said Mr. High to-night, "but that is not
true. I threw it up because it was not a
financial success, the same as I would
throw up any other venture that was not
paying. I hear that Mr. Dinpee has em
ployed General Barnes and W. W. Foote
to assist in the prosecution, but I tlo not
think they will do me much harm. It
was not fear of Mr. Dinsee that had any
thing to do with my giving up the paper.
I know Mr. Dingee is considerably rattled,
but I would never have abandoned my
fight so long as I had the paper; but I did
not propose to continue publishing for the
sake of proving that the stand I dad taken
was tbe right one when I made up mv
mind to quit."
The case that will be called in the Police
Court to-morrow is that wherein Mr.
High is charged with libel regarding an
auction sale held by Mr. Dingee. Owing
to the publicity given to the matter there
will be a crowded lobby in Judge Wood's
court.
GUS JACKSON HAS GONE,
His Father Owns He Has Re
signed His Placeâ There Is
a Lady in the Case.
He Said He Would Return This
Week â Hans Hansen Known to
Be an Ex-Convict.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 25.â Gus Jack
eon, the well-Known son of J. W. Jackson,
furniture-dealer on Park street, is among
the missing, and numbers are anxious to
know just where he has gone to. He left
last week and but few persons know of his
whereabouts. They say there is a woman
in the case.
J. W. Jackson, his father, was seen this
evening and he confessed that his son Gus
had resigned his position as bookkeeper
in the firm of Miller, Sloss & Scott, of
San Francisco. "He has not been well of
late," he said. "He went up north to the
mountains a week ago for a change of air.
I do not know all about it, but I know
there is a lady in the reason of his vaca
tion. Ido not see why the matter concerns
any one else. Yes, she lives in San Fran
cisco and that is all I care to say about it,
except that he said he would be home
about the end of this week."
Gus Jackson is a highly popular, good
looking young man. The story runs that
he has been courting a fascinating young
lady in the metropolis. A little more
than a week ago the young lady called on
Jackson at his place of business, and it is
said a date was decided on and a minister's
services were to be sought.
A friend ot Jackson, when told of his
disappearance this evening, remarked:
"So Gus has gone, has he? I thought he
would. Three months ago I saw him with
a charming widow who has plenty of
money, and asked him how things were.
He said that she wanted him to go with
her to the Sandwich Islands. He has been
keeping company with her for the past
three years, and 1 expect that is where
they have gone to."
An Ex- Convict.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 25.â Hans Han
sen, the burglar, whose capture was ef
fected oy Officers Brampton and Moebus,
had his preliminary examination in Jus
tice Morris' court this afternoon.
He has all along strenuously maintained
his innocence, and that his being along
side of the Chines laundry on Bank alley
at 5 o'clock in the morning, where the
burglary rook place, was accidental.
The "Warden at San Quentin has recog
nized Hansen as bein^ a convict who went
by the name of Christian Petersen. He
was released from San Quentin on the 14th
of April last. He was convicted before
Judge Daingerneid in 1893 of burglary in
the first degree.
Hansen has confessed to the truth of the
identification, and will plead guilty to the
charge in the Superior Court.
Matters Political.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 25.â T0-morrow
evening the new Democrats, as J. T. Flem
ing calls them, will unite with thePopu-
Jists to start a silver club a-rolline. They
will meet in Linderrnan Opera-house.
J. T. Fleming, who considers himself
one of the warhorses, a remnant of the
Dageeit end, has a meeting the same
evening in Tucker Hall.
On the other hand, the Alameda Repub
lican Club is holding meetings nightly at
its headquarters in the Peterson bock,
and making all the necessary preparations
lor uniforming its drill corps.
The Regular Republican Club is to hold
a monster meeting at the Linderman
Opera-iiouse on Saturday evening. Among
the J>r>eaker3 will be Hon. S. G. Hilborn
and Colonel Talcott. The Oakland Cam
paign Glee Club is also to be present.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 25.â Veterinary
Surgeon Carpenter has enlisted the assist
ance of a kodak. With it he intends
photograpbins the bad corners and filthy
parts of dairies. that he inspects as cor
roborative- evidence. In addition he

troversy.
A Change of Location.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Auk. 25. â Rev.

in his parish. Rev. Charles McMahon,
who has been his assistant for the past
eighteen months, has been assigned as
assistant to Rev. Father Flood of the Sacre
Cceur Charch, Fillmore street, San Fran
cisco.
Philbrook Beaten Again.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 25.â Attorney
W. H. Philbrook, who is disbarred, was
again defeated in an attempt to get a suit
before Judge Frick in the Superior Court
to-day.
H. P. Huffschnle, an agent who had
been arrested in Berkeley for violation of
the peddlers' license and discharged on
the ground that the ordinance interfered
with the interstate commerce act, had
sued Constable Brotnerton for $5000 dam
ages. He retained Philbrook upon a con
tingent fee of one-third of the amount
recovered. It was understood that Attor
ney Palmer was to appear for Philbrook,
but Hnffschule changed his mind. Palmer
tried to appear, but Judge Frick declared
he had no standing in the case and al
lowed Huffschule to substitute one for
Palmer.

MARRIED A BIGAMIST,
Mrs. Ada More Wants a Divorce
as the Easiest Way Out
of Trouble.
Cornelius Stuart Cou.d Not Get Her
Property, So He Sought Fresh
Pastures.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.J
908 Broadway, Aug. 25. J
Mrs. Ada Sarah More- Seward filed a
oompiaint for divorce to-day. Mrs. More
is the woman who was married somewhat
hurriedly about a year ago to Cornelius
Edward Stuart or Seward.
A few days after the marriage Stuart
went ty the Coanty Clerk's office and, after
being permitted to inspect the marriage
license record, he erased his name and
made it to read Seward. When charged
with the crime of mutilating a public
record he denied having done so, but when
brought to trial he admitted the erasure,
but stated that he merely wisned to cor
rect his name. Mis case was dismissed by
a jury.
A little later information came to his
new wife of another Mrs. Stuart living in
San Jose and later still another report
was received that neither of the women
had a monopoly of the man's name. A
merchant of Tulare also wanted to settle
up a financial transaction with Stuart,
but when he was free of the record
mutilating case he did not stay around
Oakland.
Is her complaint Mrs. More alleges all
the statutory offenses, especially deser
tion, as it will be easier to prove her case
and secure her release that way than by
attempting to convict Stuart of bigamy.
Mrs. More is a wfdow with a snug little
estate and Stuart had already induced her
to give him a portion of it when she dis
covered his perfidy. It is not known
where Stuart is at present.

Rev. C. A. Wooddy is the tallest minis

preacher and journalist whose utterances
are backed by the greatest weight. He is
6 feet 8 inches in height and weighs nearly

300 pounds, and is not a man to take liber
ties with. He is at present the guest of
Rev. C. M. Hill of the Tenth-avenue Bap
tist Church, and is on his way from his
home in Portland to the Baptist Conven
tion in Twin Lakes.
Last Sunday evening he occupied the
pulpit of the First Baptist Church and told
of some interesting times durine the early
history of religious work on the coast.
Mr. Wooddy is the coast secretary of
the American Baptist Home Mission Soci
ety, editor of the Pacific Baptist, the offi
cial organ of the Baptist denomination
on the coast, and a powerful preacher. He
stands 6 feet 8 inches in height and
weighs nearly 300 pounds. As he stood in
the pulpit Sunday beside Rev. C. H. Ho
bart, tbe latter looked like a boy.
He read the evening lesson from the
Scriptures where Joshua was commanded
to go up into the promised Jand and cap
ture it for the children of Israel. Spies
came into the camp and related their ex
perience 3 in the promised land, telling of
the great ciants there. When Mr. Hobart
introduced the gentleman he referred to
the matter and said : "I begin to think
that we are in the land of giants to-day
when I stand here between our Brother
Wooddy and Brother Fleenor. And there
is Brother Smith in the rear of the room."
Mr. Wooddy gave an account of his
early work in Oregon. He is a native son
of that State and can tell many historical
faots concerning it from experience. He
told of a newspaper account of one of his
earliest charges. It related how Brother
and Sister Snodgrass bad moved East,
Brother Henderson had also gone, the
clerk had joined the army, and the dea
con had committed suicide, leaving the
pastor without enough supporters to keep
up an organization. At another time
forty members moved out of the town at
a time. He stayed for a while, but was
finally forced to go, too.

PROPOSED PERMANENT EXPOSITION BUILDING.
OAKLAND, Cku, Aug. 26.â The success of the exposition has caused the director*
of that incorporated body to decide upon the erection of a permanent exposition
building. The above design was prepared by Cunningham Bros, and is now under
consideration by the board, although no action can be taken till the location has been
decided upon.
posed it took four months to get a letter
East and four months to get the paper
back. Then if a man answered the letter
for publication it took another eight
months to get the paper with the answer
into the first writer's hands. By that time
he had forgotten all about his position on
the subject.
He stated that the First Baptist Church,
established in 1849, was the first Protestant
church in California, and in eighteen
year 3 100 Baptist churches had been or
ganized, bat that owing to the migratory
habit of the people ?ixty-five of these had
been disbanded at the end of that eighteen
years, leaving only a small portion of the
field covered with churches.
Daring his stay in Oakland Mr. Wooddy
was photographed for The Call. He said :
"I have been in the newspaper business
six and a haif years. One and a half years
of that time I have been the secretary of
the A. Â±3. H. M. Society, and have traveled

OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 25.â Judge Og

ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to

A GREAT CONTEST OVER
Hundreds of Bound Students

Backstop.
A WAE DANCE OF VICTORY.
The Second Tear Men OIT- Stub
born bat Unavailing
Battle.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 25.â One of
the fiercest and long-contested rushes that
ever took place on the University of Cali
fornia campus was held to-night between
the freshmen and sophomores, resulting
in a victory for the freshmen.
For an hour and a half the struggling
mass of humanity surged and rolled on
the hard earth of the football ground.
Three hundred frosbmen and sophomores
fought a hand-to-hand combat, while 400
upper classmen looked on and gave their
advice as gained by experience in years
past.
From the outset the freshmen were in
the ascendency because of their greater
force of fighting men, though the sopho
mores kept up a stubborn fight from start
to finish. It was not until the last strug
gling sophomore was securely bound hand
and foot that the '99 men gave up tne
phost.
The sophomores, as is the custom in such
combats, made the onslaught from the
eastern slope of the campus. The fresh
men were lined up in double rank to meet
them. The two forces rushed together and
the struggle for supremacy was on. A
number of men belonging to both sides
were carried off the field in a semi-con
scious condition from sheer exhaustion.
The co-eds rendered their services in
cutting loose the bonds that held the
hands and feet of those tied. In two cases
the co-eds missed their aim and cut the
hands of those whom they had hoped to
aid, severely. Having tied all the sopho
mores and piled them up against the back
stop the victorious freshmen and the
juniors joined in c war dance about the
helpless bodies, splitting the air with their
slogans of war.
About 3000 people witnessed the scene,
among whom were numerous professors
and regents.
Fought for Lore.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 25. â A fistic
encounter, a spilling of gore and a knock
out occurred tnis afternoon in the back
yard of J. M. McNulty. The contending
parties were Payson Riggs, a youth of 17,
and Maurice Chick, a young man of like
age, who has won considerable fame be
hind the footlights. A young girl was at
the bottom of it all.
It seems that Riggs remarked a few days
ago that a certain girl friend of Chick s,
who lives in Alameda, was no lady. Chick
told Riggs that he would either have to
take back the remark or take a '"licking."
Riggs would not take it back, so hostili
ties were declared on. The fight was to be
to a finish with eight-ounce gloves. Mc-
Nulty' s back yard was staked out as the
prize-ring.
The young sloggers met this afternoon
with their seconds and proceeded to dive
into one another. They did not keep at it
long, for at the end of three minutes a
crowd bad gathered round about on the
fences and housetops and Chick had reg
istered against himself a knockout blow
between the eyes.
Riggs was declared the winner by com
mon consent, and the crowd parted the
pair.
Chick, though worsted, has the satisfac
tion of doing the best he could to uphold
the hptlor of his fair friend.
Eaniome Talks Football.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 25.â Captain
Ransome of the Berkeley football team
gave the prospective players frofti the
freshman class a talk at the "gym" this
afternoon on what they would be expected
to do if they wished to train for places on
the team under him. He said that by
September 15 nil tobacco and alcoholic
drinks must be laid aside.
"Tnis rule," said the captain, "is to be
vigorously enforced, and all infractions
will be seriously dealt with. What we
need is hard, conscientious work, and we
cannot expect faithful training from the
many if the few are allowed to set a bad
example. Discipline and self-sacrifice are
essential to success, not only at present
but in the future."
About twenty - five sturdy well-built
freshmen were present at the meeting.
At the close Captain Ransome expressed
himself as being much pleased with the
appearance of the men and their evident
determination to go into the work with
vim and energy.
Merchants Demand Protection.

petition, signed by seventy business men
from the Merchants' Protective Associa
tion, was presented to the Board of Town
Trustees last evening, aslcing that licenses
be demanded of all solicitors ami "order

ward of $750,000, and that under the exist

will hold its last meeting for drilling to

lowing circular has been issued and tells
of all their plans:
ALLIANCE, ATTENTION I
Don't get lost in the shuffle. The following
facts should be committed to memory:
Firstâ The Alliance special pulls out of the
Oakland mole at 7 p. m. sharp, Friday, August
28. If you come from the CJty this necessi
tates taking not later than the 6:30 boat
Secondâ An effort will be made to devise a
practicable plan of berth allotments; but the
chances are it will resolve itself into "first
come, first served," so come early.
The special is due at Los Angeles at 8:15
Saturday morning.
Fourthâ Returning, the Alliance is due In
Oakland Monday in time to catch the 8:15
a. m. boat to San Francisco.
Fifthâ The round trip, including sleeper,
costs you but $5. Your meals, etc., are extra,
but with the exercise of reasonable economy
your total expenditures (including fare) can
be kept below $10.
Sixthâ Tickets can be- purchased from any
member of the board, but must be signed at
time of purchase.
Seventhâ Tickets must be purchased in ad
vance and not later than Wednesday evening
(drill night), as there will be no time for
tlcket-seliing at the trainâ so bring $5 with
you that evening.
Eighthâ Rumors have come to the board to
the effect that outsiders will appear in the
uniforms of some of our members. We dis
credit the rumors as unworthy of any mem
ber of the Republican Alliance, but we wish it
most distinctly understood, both as a matter
of principle and in justice to our contributing
members, that none but actual members will
be permitted to accompany us on the train.
Every precaution hns bsen taken, and any in
truders will simply be ejected from the train.
Ninthâ Should you by any chance be unable
to counect with the train at the mole, make a
break for Sixteenth-street depot. The train
will stop there; but we advise you to show up
prompt.y at the mole.
Tenthâ Our list of addresses of members is
sadly defective. If you know of any fellow
member wno does not receive his notices,
please send his ntldress at once to Dr. 11. P.
Carlion, Crocker building, San Francisco, or to
S. D. Rogers, 572 Tenth street, Oakland.
Please don't neglect this. Yours for success,
George P. Morrow, President.

Stole a Ton of Lead.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 25.â 1t is no
easy matter to carry off 1800 pounds of
lead, but the feat was accomplished by a

and that amount of lead carted away.
Owing to the extteme weight of the stuff
it is not thought that it will go very far

SYMPATHIZERS
IN THE FIGHT.
Wheelmen Will Pledge
Candidates to an Arm
strong Bill.
OR FIGHT THEM HARD.
Battle Against the Railroad to
Be Taken Up by the
L. A. W.
TO ORGANIZE IN THE STATE.
Wheelmen Claim 8000 Riding Voters
in the City and as Many
Sympathizers.
The action of the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company in imposing a charge on
the transportation of bicycles has resulted
in cementing the wheelmen of the State
as nothing else to date has ever been able
to do.
There is now no doubt that the scores of
bicyle clubs and the "unattached" wheel
men are going to get together and pull to
gether for the purpose of fighting the
octopus in the legislative campaign next
fall. The wheelmen wane a bill passed by
the California Legislature similar to the
Armstrong bill, which is a law in the
States of New York and Ohio, classing bi
cycles as baggage and requiring railroads
to carry them as such without extra
charges.
Leading wheel men claim that the num
ber of votes they will be able to muster
for the fight with the octop'-s is not
limit d to the 15,000 riders in the City of
San Fra nclsco and the 40,000 riders in the
State. They figure that each owner of a
wheel has a friend to whom be occasion
ally loans his bicycle, ana other friends
who are thinking of taking to bicyciing
and who consult him about it, and that
all these sympathizers will use their votes
and their influence to secure the passage
by the Legislature of an Armstrong bill.
Yesterday it was decided to hold a
meeting of the Cycle Board of Trade at an
early date to consider the action of tne
railroad. The memoers of this organiza
tion comprise all the bicycle-dealers in
the City, a number of wheelmen and
others inierested in wheeling and wheels.
J. S. Conweli, president of the Cycle
Board of Trade, said yesterday: "The
tight will, of course, be a political one.
That is about the only way we can get at
it, and we shall attempt to nave a bill
passed by our Legislature similar to the
Armstrong hill which has become a law
in JSew York and Ohio. In this City we
have between 7000 and 8000 voters, and
each one of these men have sympathizers.
In addition to this the lady riders will
also have tome influence, fevery wheel
man probably loans his wheel to some
body once in a while, and that person may
be counted on as a sympathizer. We have
begun a system of enrollment of all the
unattached riders in the City. I have a
large list of them at my place of business,
and it is growing day by day."
R. C. Lennie, another dealer, said: "We
are going to make a political fight with
the railroad over this thing. Before the
campaign is over we are going to have
a working organization in every dis
trict in the State. The way to do is
to pledpe candidates for trie -Legisla
ture to the passage of a bill like the Arm
strong bill. The real fight should come,
and I understand it will come, through
the State division of the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen. The league made the
fight in is'ew York and Ohio and gained
tiie point. Wheeis are baggage and the
railroads should be coaipelled to carry
them as such. We cannot hardly get out
of town here, even on a wheelj without
paying tribute to the Southern Pacific and
it is time that something was done.
"We are peculiarly situated. Few other
citie> have confronting them an Alameda,
an Oakland and a Berkeley, and now,
after the Ist of September we must pay to
get our wheels out of town in that direc
tion."
E. H. Mohrig, another dealer, said:
"The matter properly^ belongs to the
League of American Wheelmen of the
State. The action of the railroad company
in charging for carrying wheels across the
bay and on the trains ought to be fought
hard, and it ought to be seen that nobody
gets into the Legislature who is opposed
to the passage of an Armstrong bill.
The Wheelmen's Municipal League,
just barely organized, will take up the
matter at the meeting to-morrow night.
i The fi^ht with the railroad ought to be
- carried into the State."
The Wheelmen's Municipal League
j will hold a meeting to-night at the San
I Francisco Road Club's rooms, at 503
Golden Gate avenue, at which some action
is expected to be taken in regard to open
ing the fight.
THE STOCK MARKET.
There was nothing new in mining shares yester
day. Trade was quiet and prices were slightly
lower than on Monday.
Union Con. Is assessed 20 cents.
owing to the low water In the Carson River,
which . prevents the Mexican mill from running,
the extraction of low-grade gold rock from the
Crown Point mine has been discontinued and the
mine has been closed down for an indefinite pe
riod. Out of a force of nineteen men only a day
ana a night watchman are retained. As soon as
the Carson River rises wort will be resumed in ihe
mine. -

Into my own building, at 526 Hayes su,- between
Octavla and Laguna, where I can now - display
over four times the amount of instruments than,
formerly ; as I buy for cash and in carload lots
and have no rent to pay I can offer any one desir-

than any other music house in San -Francisco.

McKINLEY AND AMERICAN LABOR.
ITALIANS AROUSED
AGAINST BRYAN,
Prominent Democrats Go
Back on the Ne
braska Man.
DECLARE FOR M'KINLET
Bryan Reviled Italians in His
Newspaper, the World-
Herald.
"BUT A STEP FBOM BANDITS."
All Over the Country Italian Votes
Will Resent the Unjust
Stigma.
North Beach is full of indignation
against W. J. Bryan and the strong feel
ing against the Democratic candidate
which prevails in the Latin quarter is
spreading among the Italian population
of this and other States. Prominent
Italian Democrats are declaring their in
tention of voting for McKinley and if the
feeling goes on growing, as it is doing at
present, the Democrats will scarcely poll
any Italian votes.
The indignation aroÂ«e from scornful and
insulting comments on Italians, written a
year ago in Bryan's paper, the World-
Herald of Omaha, and recently reprinted
by L'ltalia of this City. Other Italian
papers all over the country are oopyine
L'ltalia's lead and the consequence is a
withdrawal of Italian support from the
Democratic party.
Under the date of August 8, 1895, Bryan
said in an editorial:
As a class the Italian immigrants to the
United States are not desirable. Of all the
nations of Europe they are ihe worst. They
are ignorant, made so by bad government for
centuries which is their m'sfortune, and they
have little or no knowledge of the spirit of our
institutions. Life with them is cheap, and
among the worst and most ignorant it is but a
ttep from their present condition to the bravo
and bandit.
And again, August 12:
Among the most objectionable of the immi
grants are the low-grade Sicilian Italians, the
Huns and Mexicans. These Italians and the
Huns are densely ignorant, and they care
nothing for our institutions. Many are in
worse condition than sen's, if un-contraci. As
soon as they got a few hundred dollars back
the Italians go to Italy to spend what they
enrn here. These Italians regard human life
cheaply, and the stilletto is a ready weapon to
plunge into any one who angers them.
Bryan's editorial was inspired by Prince
town riots, which might have been sup
posed to give him, as a demagogue, an ex
cellent opportunity for preaching a ser
mon against the plutocrats; instead, how
ever, be chose to take the labor troubles
as the text for a tirade against the poor
Italian miners.
"And this is a Democrat, the chief of
Democrats, the sort of Democrat that is
now rilling the ears of our laborers with
election speeches, full of praise and prom
ises," says L'ltalia, in commenting on
Bryan's editorial.
"We wish to consider the words of the
Democratic candidate," continues L'lt
alia, "from a higher point of view than
that of National sentiment.
"On what base has Bryan pronounced
â uch summary judgment agamst Italian
immigration? Perhaps he has consulted
statistics and has learned from them that
Italians are especially prone to become
criminal*?
"No! Because the official statistics com
piled at Washington state that of all the
foreign colonies the Italian gives the small
est contingent to the criminal class. It
follows, therefore, that Bryan has either
willfully lied, or â and thisls more prob
able â he is ignorant of the social condi
tions of the country, therefore he is not a
statesman.
"But the most authentic and complete
lie is given to Bryan Dy the celebrated Dr.
Senner, the Commiesioner of the United
States attached to the Bureau of Immigra
tion. He is an earnest and learned man,
naying no need of cheap popularity, and
he is being continually brought in con
tact with immigrants from all the Euro
pean nations. Dr. Senner, in an article
on Italian immigration, published in the
North American Review recently and
copied in the Review of Reviews, has
words full of praise for the Italian immi
grants, whom he judges to be â in contra
diction to Bryan â 'among the best and
most easy to assimilate elements in the
United States.'
" 'The Italians,' says Senner, 'are not
turbulent, violent and harmful, as they
are often represented in American papers
as being.' He also shows the ignorance
or the unreliability of Bryan when he
hays. 'Italians no longer come to this
country as birds of passage. The later

This preparation is no secret.

BUSINESS DEPRESSION AND BRYANISM.
Strong Evidence That Free Trade is the Cause of Industrial
Disturbances*
immigrants no longer come and go, they
are coming here for good and all.'
"What can one think," continues L'lta
lia, "of this Mr. Bryan who thus
throws insults in our faces, when
the man most competent to pro
nounce judgment in the matter de
clares the exact contrary? We must
conclude that he i? not of tne stuff to be
come President of this great and glorious
republic, that he has not the seriousness
and the culture befitting a statesman.
Our Italian electors possess no small in
fluence in the coming struggle and we
nourish the nope that they will not for
getâbefore votingâ that they are Ital
ians."
It was the publication of these articles
that has aroused a storm of indignation
among Italian residents. Prominent
Democrats, among whom are G. Calegans
and D. Caglieri, have announced their in
tention of voting for McKinley, but a few
devoted disciples still cling to Bryan and
declare that they would never believe him
capable of penning such a tirade. To
saiisfv these doubting Thomases the fol
lowing telegram was dispatched i>y
L'ltalia:
To the Editor of the World- Herald, Omaha,
Xcb.: On the Btn and 12th 01 August, 1895,
Mr. Bryan published in the World-Herald two
editorials insulting to Italinns living in
America. Our daily V Italia is in favor of the
Republican party and we loyally notify you
that as Italians we are fighting against Mr.
Br'-an ; also on account of the unjust insults
hurled by him at Italian immigrants. Should
Bryan oryoursell wish to make any statement
on the matter, we have no objection to pub
lishing it in our paper.
A week has gone by since the dispatch
of the telegram, but no response has come
to gladden the hearts of Bryan's small
contingent. During the week of grace
L'ltalia refrained from all editorial com
ment on the obnoxious editorials, but to
day the tew Italian Democrats who have
not turned against Bryan will again be
urged to do so, and as Italian papers in
other States are following suit the loss of
voters to Bryan will certainly be great.
E. Patriii, one of the editors of L'ltalia,
said yesterday : "Besides the fight on sil
ver, we now, as Italians, have another
fight against Bryan. We do not wish to
judge from a narrow standpoint, but he is
certainly very unreliable, or else he is
icnorant of the social conditions of his
country, and in either case he is not fit to
be President."
T. Almacia, editor of L'ltalia, said: "In
North Beach alone there are over 3500
Italian voters. Three thousand would
have voted the Republican ticket anyway,
but the two editorials published by Bryan
have alienated a large number of the re
maining 500, and are crtain to have the
same effect all over the United States."

Miss Sarah Peters, Seven Years
in the Riot Sections of
China.
Her Story of the Need of Educated
Physicians and of the Progress
of the Church.
Mi3S Sarah Peters of Illinois, who has
been for seven years laboring as a mission*
ary at Nanking, China, under the auspices
of the Woman's Board of Foreign Mis
sions, is at the Occidental. Nanking is a
city of about 500.000, in the province or
Quang Sn, 200 miles up the Yangtse River
from Shanghai. It is there that some of
the comparatively recent riots have oc
curred, but Miss Peters was not injured.
"If they know you well they are not apt
to hurt you," said Miss Peters. "The
Yangtse Valley, where a good many of
our missionaries are at work, is known as
Central China. It is a very rich agricult
ural country, I may say the richest in the
whole of China. Elegant passenger steam
ers traverse the Yangtse River, so that it
is no trouble for us to get about.
"We have our books all printed in the
Chinese and English languages, so that
the natives may make as much progress
as possible. The Chinese are very tract
able, and learn quite easily. Our mission
work is going forward in a very successful
way.
"There is especial need of missionaries
who have a knowledge of medicine and
surgery. Over most all of China if a per
son sustains a severe fracture of a bone
there is no one who can set it. Their doc
tors would know nothing at all about how
to set it. nor do they in fact know any
thing of surgery in any of its depart
ments.
"Going back with my party are Dr.
Mary Stone and Dr. Ida Kahn. both of
Kinkiang, youne native Chinese women
who have lately completed the medical
course at the Michigan State Medical Col
lege, Ann Arbor. They were educated in
English before they "left China. Miss
Stone's mother is a Christian, and Miss
Stone was the first Chinese child in all
that region whose feet were left unbound,
and which grew in their natural way.
They have just completed four years at
Ann Arbor. They will practice medicine
in connection with the other workers in
the Methodist mission."
Miss Ida Deayer of Philipsburg, Pa., is
also at the Occidental, en route to Ching
Kang, and Miss Clara Merrill of Flint,
Mich., who is going to Kinkiang. They
will all sail on the steamer Coptic to
morrow for the mission fields of China.
Attorney Glidden Again.
The case of Attorney Glidden, indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury for having written
Improper letters to Miss Jennie Ryan, has as
sumed, according to reports, a new phase.
The story goes that ' friends of Glidden ap
proached Mrs. Ryan, the mother of the young
lady who accuses :â  Attorney Glidden iof im
proper conduct, requesting that the prosecu
tion be stopped. Mrs. Ryan refused to enter
tain such a proposition, whereupon, she Rays,
her visitors declared that they had friends in
the City who could , and would swear to the
innocence of the accused man and incidentally
make things extremely disagreeable for the
accuser. Mrs. Ryan naturally refused to enter
tain such a proposition, hut instead reported
the affair to Inspector Shrall, who will inves
tigate the matter.. :â â¢ '

In a Critical Condition.
Mrs. Crowle.-, 315 Beale street, who was
brutally beaten and kicked by John Collins, a
longshoreman, was in a critical condition at
the City and County Hospital last night. She
Mas in a high fever, and little hope was enter

Collins, who is in the City Prison, will have to
answer to a charge of murder.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1896.
The masses are beginning to see that
the Democrats are dodging the free trade
question in this campaign and they are
beginning to ask why they hide their
faces in shame when confronted with the
sad record of failure under Cleveland ism.
The crhost of the ruin already wrought by
the Wilson bill will not down, however
much Bryan and his supporters try. to
divert attention from the issue most vital
to the people.
"How will free coinage help the man
who has no bullion?" the workingman
asks as he turns and contemplates the
widespread ruin wrought by, the very
measure advocated by Bryan aa a panacea
for all industrial ills.
Lest it be charged that the present hard
conditions have only lately been attributed
to the Cleveland and Bryan free trade
policy it is well to refer to records that
were extant long before this year's Na
tional conventions made their platforms
and named their candidates.
A careful report on American business
conditions was made by the American
Economist in October, 1894, by which it
plainly appeared that wages were then on
the average, 45 per cent less than in 1892
-that there was no work for 30 per cent of
the people; that the output of the factories
had decreased 44 per cent; that the aver
age earnings feJl off $55 per head, and that
billions of dollars less money circulated
than circulated two years before
The report showed that 320* different
employers of labor were unable to find
work for 20,800 hands in 1894, and that they
paid $8,000,000 less wages than in IS
The report concludes as follows
"There was a loss of $55 for the year
for every individual employed. The analy
sis of the reports, according to sections of
the country, brings the facts learned by
the investigation committee more strik
ingly home, both to the employer of labor
and the employe. The statements pre
sented regarding the conditions that have
recently existed in the different sections
ol the country are also extremely inter
esting. J
"A valuable tabulated exhibit is that
which shows the percentage of business
that was done by each separate industry
this year as compared with 1892. Unfor
tunately there are very few cases where
there has been no shrinkage, and there
was but one showing an increased busi
ness for this yaar.
"The McKinley census that was ta^en
by the American Protective Tariff League
in 1892 proved that over $40,000,000 of
money had been invested in new or en
larged industries within two years. Also
that work had been provided for 37,285
additional hands.
"Now we are under the painful necessity
of showing that 20,800 people have been
deprived of work in 320 different industries.
Also that those who weie at work have re
ceived nearly $8,000,000 less money within
sax months than they did two years ago.
It is shown further that the amount of
business was but 56 per cent of that trans
acted in 1892.
"A. year ago this month we published the
results of our industrial census. This
showed that there had been a decrease in
business within twelve months of 47.2 per
cent, a decrease in wages earned of 69 per
cent and a decrease in the number of
persons employed in factories of about 60J4
per cent.
"We now have to report a shrinkage of
60 per cent in the nnmber of persons em
ployed ; a loss of 45 per cent in the amount
of wages earned and of 44 per cent in the
output of industrial establishments. A
year ago the averas;e|decrease was recorded
as $2 35 per week in the wages of each em
ploye, or $61 10 for the half year's work.
We now record a loss of $55 for each per
son for the six months' wr>rk this year as
compared with the money that he earned
during the same period in 1892.
"If we look back still further and com
pare the present results with the census of
1890, we find on the basis of the reports
that we have received that there were as
many as 1,413,550 idle persons in the coun
try this year who were actively employed
in 1890. We further find that there were
more than one billion dollars less wages
earned than in 1892. We further find that
the value of the product of the factories
has decreased by more than five billion
dollars. Also that three billion dollars
less money has been paid for material to be
used in manufactures.
"We cannot but accept as thoroughly
reliable the information we have received,
and upon which we have based our calcu
lations. It is extremely painlul to us to
record such a distressful condition of
business, which must involve pincning
and poverty in most American house
holds.
"After these facts have been carefully
studied by every reader and thinker in
the country, we should hardly expect to
find one solitary individual to advocate a
policy of free trade as against protection
to American labor and American indus
tries."
The foregoing figures stand in bold re
ply to the oft-asserted accusation of the
popocrats, that the Republicans of 1896
are reviving a cry of free trade and ruin
to divert attention from the money ques
tion. The truth is that the Republicans
of this year, like those of every year, re
fuse to shut their eyes to the fact that free
trade has ruined the wages and the indus
tries of the country. Republicans are not
crying free trade and ruin so much as
they are asking the Democrats to account
for their utter failure to bring prosperity
out of the Wilson bill.
No one who has studied the question
even in the most elementary way will
deny the fact that Bryan was a champion
of the Wilson bill, which he promoted
as a panacea for industrial ills. He was
so full of promises that his lips were as
roses. In free wool, free iron, free lum
ber and free products from afar he beheld
the signs of a coming Eden. While strik
ing down the industries of the country
and reducing American labor to the verge
of starvation he forcibly held out the illu
sory hope that the dagger of free trade
was a magical wand of progress. The
cool man who studies the foregoing re
port will see the extent to which Bryan
has tried to mislead the people.
The disasters that have occurred in the
industrial and commercial world since
1894 have been along the line of those that
began with the iirst threats of free trade.
There is scarcely an industry from one
ocean to the other that has not felt the
blight of the Wilson bill. It has been
shown that the woolen industry has been
hurt in every part, from the shepherd
among his flocks to tne girl at the loom;
that Canadian lumber has hurt the Ameri
can trade; that cheap iron has stopped
hundreds of forges and closed hundreds
of factories, and yet the popocratic cam
paigners persist in saying that there is no
tariff question.
People are beginning to inquire, how
ever, why it is that Bryan is tshiimed of
his party's record on free trade. They are
wondering why the orators sent forth
from the Chicago convention are not
pointing with pride to the record of their
party, instead of covering their faces and
standing mute in the presence of damag
ing accusations.
The efforts of the stump speakers, how
ever, cannot prevent the people from turn
ing to the Democratic record of shame
every chapter of which is a story of in
famy, a record of promises unredeemed.

WOULDN'T DEFEND THEM
Baggett Would Tell the Board
of Supervisors to Come
Out Openly.
Argument in the Geary-Street Fran
cbise Ended and the Case
Submitted.
The Geary-street franchise .matter was
submitted to Judge Daingerrield yesterday
afternoon at the conclusion of arguments
which occupied the entire day. It was in
timated by counsel of both sides that they
desired the opportunity to submit addi
tional authorities within the next ten or
fifteen days, and the court remarked that
proper allowance would be made for
them.
The arguments on the writs of certiorari
and prohibition were concluded with the
morning session, but Judge Daingerrield
announced that he would reserve his de
cision on them until after the third and
last writ, that of prohibition, had been
discussed and would then consider them
all together.
The three writs were issued to George
Fletcher, a private citizen, to restrain the
Board of Supervisors from opening bids on
a Geary-street franchise to run for fifty
years after 1903, the year in which the
Southern Pacific Company's present privi
lege on that street will end. It was that the
alleged peculiar terms of the proposition
and the < arly date at which it is made, were
calculated to give the present owners of the
franchise an opportunity to defraud the
people by making what might appear as
I the largest bid while in fact it would re
sult in an ultimate lode to the City treasurer.
The bids were to be so much money Tor
the privilege and such a percentage- of the
gross receipts of the road.
Mr.Fletcher doubled the purity of the mo
tives of the Board of Supervisors in devis
ing such terms, and he was suspicious of
an innocent looking scheme with C. B.
Huntington behind it. He thought he
saw a plan to handicap the honest bidder.
The railroad might put in the bigeest bid
and offer the highest per cent of gross re
ceipts, hold the franchise simply to pre
vent competition, then run cars at infre
quent intervals and rely upon traffic on
its adjacent parallel lines, and really pay
the city very much less in the long run
than a smaller bid by* an honest bidder
would have amounted to.
To each of the writs the City and
County Attorney, acting in defense
of the Board of Supervisors, yester
day offered these three objections: First,
that the complaint did not furnish suffi
cient facts; second, that the court did not
have jurisdiction in the case; third, that
the plaintiff, being a simple taxpayer and
unable to show that he was to be person
ally injured, had no capacity to sue. He
claimed that the writs were inconsistent,
and that if one of them applied the others
could not. A great many cases were cited
and authorities read in support ot a
lengthy argument against the three writs.
Attorneys Baggett and Samuels for the
complainant denied that there was any
inconsistency. "But we don't care," re
marked Baggett, "under what writ it is
classed, under what bead it comes; if the
Board of Supervisors steals judicially,
legislatively or administratively it makes
no difference, the people who elected them
to the position of trustees should have the
power to restrain them. I tell you, Mr.
Brobeck," he declared, in reply to a ques
tion as to what he would do were he counsel
for the other side, "I would not make a
defense of the Board of Supervisors if I
were City and County Attorney. I would
not interpose a demurrer. I would Bay,
'Show the people that you have nothing to
hide, you are trustees of the people.' If I
were aefending a private individual I
would, of course, make a defense.
"Do you say a taxpayer is not injured
by the difference between $1,600,000 and
$5000 a year in the City's revenues?
"If a wrong be contemplated we think it
should be prevented, arid that this court
has jurisdiction to prevent it. Inasmuch
as there is a charge of fraud on the part
of the Board of Supervisors, that claim is
sufficient in itself to warrant this court in
granting all tnese writs."
Mr. Samuels cited the case ot the Spring
Valley Water Company vs. the Board of
Supervisors, whera the Superior Court
held that the court had power to interfere
if on its face toe contemplated act was
fraudulent and corrupt. The writs fiied
on which the judgment was entered were
submitted by Attorney Herrin, then em
ployed by the water company, but now in
the employ of the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
The citation of that case apparently an
noyed the Southern Pacific attorney, J. E.
Foulds, w(o up to that time had sat si
lently at the table near Brobeck rolling a
pencil between his thumbs and cultivating
a smile bounded on the north by a pair of
gold spectacles, on the south by a shirt
bosom ana on the east and the west by the
walls of the courtroom.
At the conclusion of the argument Judge
Daingerfield, reviewing as is his custom
the points as he understands them, ex
pressed the opinion, liable, he said, to
change on more mature deliberation, that
the bid on the franchise is untenable, and
that the defect, if there be a defect, is ju
risdictional.
P. F. Osborne Attached.
P. P. Osbornc, the Market-street hardware
man, was attached yesterday for $9300 on a
judgment obtained several days ago by J. M.
Master. Osborne's troubles began when he
was attached for a small plumber's bill, over
which there was a dispute, and the second at
tachment was imposed soon after the first
trouble nÂ»d been nettled.

Committee and Mass-Meetings
Next Saturday.
The executive committee of the National
Republican League, together with tne
finance committee â Tirey L. Ford in the
chair â met in their new headquarters
in the Pioneer building last evening, and
made arrangements for the opening of the
league headquarters next Saturday even
ing with a mass-meeting in Pioneer Hall
and also in their new rooms.
The committee of arrangements reported
that they had engaged Cassassa's band
and a glee club to furnish entertainment
for the visitors. Prominent speakers hare
been secured and among them are:
Colonel John P. Jackson, Irving M. Bcott,
General Fredericks, Judge J. A. Waymire,

itors will be made comfortable.
There will be another big mass-meeting
at the Auditorium, corner of Jones and
Eddy, next Saturday evening, at which
M. M. E3tee will speak on "Protection and
the Financial Issue." Mr. Estee's reputa
tion as a logical speaker and as a man
thoroughly informed on the subjects of
which he will speak, will, no doubt, draw
an overcrowded house. Persons wishing
to get seats should go early.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee have made the following assignment
of speakers for the week:
Colonel T. V. Eddyâ San Luis Obispo.
August 31; Arroyo Grande, September 1;

F. P. Wickersnam, chairman of the
Board of Supervisors of Fresno County,
and C. W. Garratt, Supervisor from the
First District of Fresno, paid a visit to the
rooms of the Republican State Central
Committee in the Palace Hotel the other
day and reported Republicanism as boom-
ing in that county. Fresno at one time
was. a hotbed of Democracy, but now all
the offices except Coroner and a Justice of
the Peace are Republican. They are for
protection and a good dollar.
State Senator E. C. Voorhees is spend
ing a few days at the Palace Hotel. He
reports two very successful Republican
meetings in his county thus far. The
siver craze is beginning to die out in his
district, as wage earners are reflecting
upon the meaning of a dollar which
means a dollar.
National Committeeman ~ John D.
Spreckels is in receipt of hundreds of
letters daily from all parts of the coast
testifying to the growing popularity of
McKinley and protection.
Senator F. C. Frank and Senator S. N.
Androus are spending a few days in this
City. They report a growing boom for
McKinley and protection.
S. J. Duckworth of Monterey, who has
been in town for a few days, returned
home this morning. He will take an
active part in the campaign in the way
of making speeches, etc.
George B. Kaizenstein of Sacramento,
treasurer for the Earl Fruit Company, is
visiting friends in this City. He is solid
for sound money and protection. He re
ceived a day or two ago a letter from a
locomotive engineer in Guatemala to the
effect that he was receiving wages of $7 50
a day in free silver, but that everything else
was so dear on account of the cheapness
of the freely coined silver dollar that
he could not savt anything out of his
wages. Butter is $1 50 per pound, a 90
-cent woolen hat sells for $4, board is $15
per week and everything else in propor
tion. Guatemala is an object lesson in
free silver.
The Folsom Club.
The Folsom Club held a meeting last
night at its clubrooms at Fourth and
Perry streets. Speeches were made by Dr.
Heino and Charles O'Brien.
Twenty-five signed the roll, increasing
the membership to ninety-five.
A resolution was passed indorsing J. D.
Spreckels as leader; also W. J. Hawkins
for Coroner. The meeting adjourned with
cheers for McKinley and the ticket.
Alta Republicans.
The Alta Repubiican Club at its meet
ing last night, completed its list of per
manent officers, by electing John Rhodes
secretary, Georee Hunt treasurer, Harry
Edwards, Edward Jones and Robert Kef

weeks.
Mr. Curry was born in England nearly
sixty-three years ago, but came to this
country with his father and mother when
only a child. They settled in Wisconsin
when that State was a Territory. He grew
up there, and was one of the organizers of

taken a prominent part in politics, al
thouph he never ran for office.

the Supreme Lodge and oast supreme sen
tinel. _ " Â
Deceased was one of the corporate direc
tors of the Grand Lodge, Ancient Order
United Workmen, and has attended all
their sessions for the past fifteen years.
He wad one of the best-informed men in
the State in political and fraternal matters,
and as a speaker he has always been in
ereat demand.
As a member of the Howard Methodist
Church he was a good Christian.
Forty-one years ago Mr. Curry married
Miss Emma J. Kirn ball of the family of
that name that settled in Vermont one
century before the revolution. His widow

Butte County Miners.
The Butte County Miners' Association will
meet in the first week in September for the
purpose of reorganizing. The purpose of this
is to allow the association to conform to the
new constitution and by-laws of the California
Miners' Association. Julian Sonntag of the
latter body will assist the Butte miners in re
organizing. From all accounts there is a Gen
eral revival of interest in mining matters in
Butte County and the association desires to
Â»ena a large delegation to the California
Miners' Association Convention, which will
be held in this city on November 10.
Died in Convulsions.
Paul Demartini, manager of Frank and Paul's
Exchange, 224 Montgomery avenue, was sud
denly taken with convulsions at the Grove
Street Theater last night and was promptly
taken to the Receiving Hospital where he died
soon after midnight. His body was taken to
the Morgue and an autopsy will be necessary
to determine the cause of death.
