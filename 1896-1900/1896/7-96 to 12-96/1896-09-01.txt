BAN BERNARDINO. Cal., Aug 31.â
This has been a irreat day for the Republi
cans of this county. Tbe formal opening
of the campaign at the pavilion to-nieht
by Hon. Samuel M. Shortridare marked a
revival oi the oid-fasnioued spirit that
moved men in the days when their liber
ties ai.d homes were assailed by the hordes
of Democracy in the past. People of all
grades of political beliei? poured into town
from workshop and lield and filled the pa
viiion. It was a representative, thought
iul audience, composed of earnest people â
people who came to listen, to reason to
getner and to applaud. When Mr. tshort
rid^e announced that he came to address
the people as Californians, regardless of
their past party affiliations, he struck a
Keynote that met with hearty applause,
i! stated that it was a time for earnest
thought and patient investigation, and
bela it to be the duty of every man to act
at the polls in such a mariner as to pre
serve his country's honor and promote the
general welfare of the people.
It is the opinion oi" conservative Repub
lican- that the meeting will result in great
Republican gains. Editor R. C. Haruison
cf the Sun said: "We have needed just
such an awakening. The reaction for Mc-
Kinley has set in in earnest, and this
meeting cements Republicans and brings
new strength. "
Judge F. W. Gregg said: "I now fee.
sure that McKinley will sweep tho coun
try. Ihe sound doctrines so eloquently
propounded by Mr. Shortridge will do
much to bring every true patriot into line."
Chairman Fleming of the County Cen
tral Committee is hopeful over the out
look. "With a few such rousing m?et
ings," he said, "the people will see where
truth and justice lie, and there will be
little danger of Democratic success."
J. A. Whitmoresiaiu : "Seidom has there
been such enthusiasm here. We need just
such service as Mr. Shortridee is doing for
the party. I think the outlook for Re
publican success is growing brighter every
day."
J. C. Lynch is another hopelul Repub
lican of prominence. He said: "When ;be
masses hear the charming doctrines of Pte
vmblicanism proclaimed thus in a bold
and eloquent way they will not wander
from the fold. This meeting marks a re
newal of the old faithâ thia country is
safe."
in spite of the unusual heat the pavilion
was crowde& at an eariy hour. The fol
lowing vice-presidents occupied the plat
form: T. H. Goff, Arnold Atwood, \V. S.
Hooper, W. C. Fuller, Dr. J. M. Hurley,
C. B. Hamilton, C. W. Allen, J. L. Bat

There was enthusiasm in town long be
fore the arrival of Mr. Shortridge. The
following gentlemen were tha committee
that escorted him from Colton to San Ber
nardino: Hon. J. C. Lynch, candidate
for Lieutenant-Governor; W. S. Hooper,
C. W. Allen, J. A. Whiimore and Coionel
L. F. Eggers. They escorted the distin
guished visitor to the Stewart, where
luncheon awaited the party, and the after
noon was spent by the committee in ar
ranging for the great meeting.
Long before 8 o'clock, in spite of the
oppressive heat of the evening, the great
pavilion was crowded with thousands of
representative citizens, who listened with
patience and applauded with vigor as the
orator scored point after point against the
Democrats.
C. C. Haskell, chairman of the County
Central Committee, called the meeting to
order and intioduced Colonel L. P. Eggers
as chairman. The Riverside Quartet sang
"The Free-trade Mill," whereupon Mr.
Shortridge was escorted to the platform
amid great applause. Colonel Eggers
njade a happy speech, introducing Mr.
Shortridge as one Known throughout the
West "as a student, lawyer and orator fit
to propound the great issues of the day."
Colonel Eggers made a graceful speech on
the issues of the campaign saying:
"The present is an auspicious period in
American history. Within ten years
there have not been such vital issues
before the people as now. Four years ago
the Democrats made rosy promises and
stated their purposes. They have had
control of the Government and, as uÂ«ual.
they have completely failed. [Great
laughter and applause.] The result is
complete bankruptcy and destitution on
every nand."
Following this neat speech, Mr. Short
ridge was presented, the audience ap
plauding for some minutes. He was in
good voice and the multitude was ripe to
he *r him preach the gospel of protection
The San Francisco Call
and prosperity. He held their attention
with frequent interruptions of applause,
for more than an hour and a half, begin
ning as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen of San
Bernardino, fellow-citizensâ all of you Callfop
nians I know, Americans I know, and menaud
women devoted to your city, your county,
your State and your country. It is to me a
matter of pride and a matter of genuine pleas
ure to look into the faces of so many intelli
gi-nt. thoughtful, earnest men and women. 1
beg you to believe t,hat I am here for the same
purpose as you; that I come here for the same
object; that I am not here for any personal
display, not to achieve any temporary
tnumj.h, or to beg from you any temporary
applause; but I am here, as you are, to con
sider wnerein lies your duty to this great
campaign, wherein lies tne duty of the Ameri
can man, and wherein lies the duty of the
genuine American woman, wlierein lies the
duty ot the Californian who loves his State, of
a citizen who is interested in the welfare of
his country; and believe men when I say to
yon that, without prejudice, without affecta
tion, without animosity toward any man, I
affirm as a result of some reflection that the
welfare of California and the welfare of our
beloved country as a Nation depends upon the
triumph of William McKinley. [Applause.]
If there be men here who differ from me; if
there be men here who were taught in other
schools of politics, who worship, maybe, at
other shrines, who were taught to revere the
name of Jackson or Jefferson and the long line
of distinguished Democratic statesmen; if
there be men here who have heretofore affili
ated with other parties, marched under other
banners, listened to other arguments and be
lieved in them, I beg you to give me credit for
the same sincerity which 1 will willingly ac
cord to you. I give you credit for loving your
country, and I should think that if there is a
man in this audience who would not lay down
ho lite for that dear beloved banner of the
American stars he would be unworthy of the
name of an American citizen. [Applause. J
And I know there is no such man here. I
know that though men differ upon political
quej-tions, though they may get heatet in de
bate, though they may differ radically upon
questions of the hour, yet an audience such as
this, men such as are here in your county,
are, after all and above till, devoted to the con
stitution and liberty and to ihe flag. And,
therefore, I know that I may speak to you
freely, sincerely, frankly, in the hope that you
may come to believe, as I believe, that the
welfare of our country, the restoration of busi
ness, the revival of industries, lie in the tri
umph of the Republican party in this cam
paign. [Applause.]
The welfare of our country and the restora
tion of business prosperity and confidence lie
In the restoration of the Republican party to
power. [Ar.plause.] The great trouble is not
that the people lack patriotism; not that they
have drifted away from the true principles of
government, but that they have listened to
false prophets and bad logic. We must brine
back to power the party that has the brains,
statesmanship and business sagacity to con
duct the National Government successfully.
[Prolongt-d applause.]
Would you trust a captain who loses every
vessel ? Would you believe in a man who has
failed in everything ? Yet the Democrats ask
you to do this-â ask you to trust them when
they have failed in all their pledges. A few
years ago the air wus full of Democratic 1 prom
ises â promises free as the air. Their doctrines
of free trade were Fet forth as panaceas for all
our ills. ]Laughter.] But let me say this in
all earnestness: If there is a Democrat in this
audience who is proud of the administration
of his party for the past four years I :~houM
like to have his phot.graph takes: and enlarged
to exhibit to the people of this State. [Great
applause.]
Yet, my friends, it is foolish people that for
get the past, even if the past dies Soon. Each
day dies, each flower fades, yet the experience
of the dead days ought to live as a beacon light
for the future.
But a few months ago no one was so rash as
to suppose that the Democrats had one chance
in forty, much less one in sixteen. [Laugh
ter.] Why? Because the party had cast gloom
everywhere and the people had refused to fot
low more the politicaldoctor who had brought
all his patients to the cemetery. [Gr at ap
plause.] Then why does anybody follow the
Democratic party now? I ask you to apply the
same business sense to politics that you do in
the ordinary affairs of life. Here you find a
party whose promises have ali been ropes of
sand, and If you use your brains, if patriots
everywhere will only think, we will b? saved,
and, thank God, we will have seen the end of
Democracy in this country.
This sentiment met with prolonged ap
plause, after which the speaker hastened
to the tariff question, saying:
The Sate of California has lost more on the
Wilson bill than it would have lost by a blight
or by a total failure of crops. Yet while this
State has lost many millions the New England
States are in sackcloth and ashes, villages
throughout the land are deserted ana the
whole country is psostrated by one brief but
disastrous reign of Democracy. [Applause.]
Fellow-citizens, if you want prosperity, if
you want the factories to start, the products <">[
the farm protected and a general revival of
business vote for McKiniey, who stands for the
American system. [Great applause.]
The speaker next devoted himself to the
attempt of the Democrats to stir up sec
tional strife. Said he:
It;is wrong in this campaign to create tne
Impression that there are classes in this coun
try. What's in broadcloth or in rags? We are
all Americans, and all are equal beiore the
lav. There is do East, no West, no North, no
South. It is all one country, one constitution,
one flag, one destiny. [Great applause.]
Coming to the silver question, the
speaker said many things which met with
great applause. While he persistently
denied that silver was the overshadowing
issue, he admitted that it was an impor
tant question in the campaign. T c
Democrats never discovered it until the
eleventh hour.
But the Republican party has been pre-eml
nentiy the friend oi silver. It nasdone for the
cau>.e of silver more by far\han the Democrats
accomplished from Jefferson to Cleveland.
L'p to 18-11 the whole amount of silver coined
in this country was about eight millions of
dollars, but the amount from that time on runs
bu . oiid $450,000,000. In 1801 there were in
circulation but 13 cents per capita, while to
day $8 circulate for every person. [Applause.]
The Repub.ican party is for honest, genuine
bimetallism. That great party is for conserva
tive money; it favors gold and silver, the ono
uqual to the other. We want a dollar worth
100 cents, so that if you take the wings of
morning and fly to the wave-washed isles of the
distant sea, wnn auy piece of money bearing
the American stamp, it will dc* worth Ks fnce
In sold. [Tremedous applause.]
Why is it that the American silver dollar is
worth 100 cents? Why are ali forms of our
circulating medium kept at par, even the little
nickel? Because the Republican party has
enacted and preserved the true system oi
money, so that all grades of money are redeem
able in coin, in gold. But the Government
cannot keep these forms of money at par if the
mints of the United States are thrown open to
the silver oi the world. If we stay wh^re we
are and follow busi ness lines we are safe, but
if we follow false prophets we will go to' the
wa'.l.
Now I want you to bear in mind that the
Republican party has made a promise to do all
in its power for international bimetallism*!
but that party is not rash enough to oppose
the en'ire commercial world on a scheme that
would bankrupt the treasury of the entire
Nation.
I tell you, fellow-citizens, tins great Nation
mu-i be sustained in its honor and intcgrit.-.
There are gome things more to be desired than
gold and silver. We must uphold National
honor aud bound niouey, must preserve the

constitution and the fiac, emblems of our lib
erty.
Mr. Shortridge discussed the tariff at
considerable leng'h, showing that free
tra'ie had ever brought ruin, and provine
the truth of McKinley's proposition that
open mills are more to be desired than
oppn mints. At the conclusion of the
speech there was great applause.
Republicans feel that the campaign has
Degun in earnest and that McKiuley and
protection will win.
JAPAN MAY LOSE FORMOSA.
European Powers Casting Longing Eyes
Toward the Island That Cannot Be
Fully Subdued.
SEATTLE," Wash., Aug. 31.â Th* steam
ship Miike Maru arrived in port this after
noon trom Yokohama, Japan, with the
following advices: Formosa contiuues in
a state of rebellion acainst Japanese rule.
Japanese forces are kept constantly on the
alert in an endeavor t.o subdue the rebels.
Discussing this state of affairs the Japan
Daily Mail urges the immediate suppres
sion of upri-ings and says: "There are
certain foreign countries that have long
turned longing eyes upon Formosa, and
are most anxious to gain possession of it.
If in view of these repeated disturbances
and failures to administer the island the
world decides that Japan is not competent
to hold it, what a bitter disgrace it will be
to her."
Continuing, the paper says the only way
in which the Government can raise funds
for the suppression of disorder and to
bring about peace is "to take a really bold
step, racing a loan, domestic and foreign,
on security of the island. If Formosa be
placed in pledge there would be no diffi
culty in obtaining 100,000,000 yen, for for
eigners would be delighted to go into such
an investment."
Early in August many papers discussed
the probable resignation of the Ito Minis
try. The Kokumin said: "The Ito Cabi
net is clever in pleasing foreigners, but
unskilled in using them to its own pur
poses. Hence it meets with many contre
temps in its foreign policy. The methods
pursued by the Ito Cabinet suggest that
to show friendship toward the representa
tives of great powers is deemed sufficient,
but we see no evidence of any attempt to
make use of the services of foreigners so
that Japan's interests may be boldly
pushed."
Great damage is being done by floods
to the rice crop and property in Niigata.
The rice harvest has bÂ«en reduced less
than half, and the Prefect of Niigata has
ordered that no rice be exported "until
the misery of poor sufferers has been alle
viated to a reasonable extent."
The western part of Toyama has been
flooded and over 6000 houses inundated.

SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Aug. 31.âTo
morrow is the opening aay of the forty
third annual fair of the State Agricultural
Society. To-morrow the big show at one
of the handsomest and most spacious pa
vilions and at one of the fastest tracks
that was ever pressed by a horseshoe will
open. The crowd is coming, and the
hotels are prepared for the crowd. That a
large representation is expected from some
of the truly rural districts oi the State is
indicated by the enterprising landlord,
who is also in business as a lifetfcaver,
brand new signs reading thus hanging
from some of the chandeliers:
"Please do not blow out the gas. It will
kill you."
Out at the beautiful pavilion everything
is hurry and bustle. A great force of
painters, decorators, carpenters, exhibit
ors and expressmen were rushing to and
fro to-day, bringing exhibits out of boxes
and order out of chaes. The roofs of the
pavilion are one vast spectacle of glowing,
moving colors. Flags and penants and
graceful festoons hang from the ralters.
It at once brings to the memory visions of
the Midwinter Fair.
The exhibits were not all in this after
noon, but the work of arranging them con
tinued with an extra force of men last
night, and they were hard at work until
far into tc-night. In fact it was the inten
tion not to stop work at all until the
pavilion was presentable for the opening.
An idea of the extent of the show may be
had from the fact that in an annex to the
main pavilion there are 1200 coops for prize
' chickens, and every coop is taken. The
chicken show alone will bring procession
after procession of spectators. ?Â£art of the
space of Machinery Hall was given^up"to
the poultry exhibit.
Though all the pictures are not yet hung,
it ia said that the art gallery will present
a greater variety of pictures and be a finer
exhibit artistically than that at any pre
ceding fair. Tnis morning .there were
great piles of boxes and cases containing
rare works ol art on the floor, but they
were being rapidly opened and the pictures
hung by an energetic corps of workers. It
was promised that the art gallery would

The livestock exhibit out at the race
track will be on>: of the finest departments
of the fair. Herds came in on ever\
freight train to-day. It may take this de
partment a day or two to put on its beat
appearances.
Cassava's band will supply the music for
the nineteen days of the fair. There will
be no formal opening exercises. The fair
will just open, the ticke'.-takeis will take
their places, the band will play and spec
tators will be made welcome. Next week
there is to be a big speech by Senator
Henry M. Teller of Colorado and other
prominent Eastern politicians.
Special pride i> taken in the departments
of horticulture and viticulture. Aa these
resources are two of the State's great
specialties, so are they purticu ! arly exten
sive and attractive departments ot the
fair.
The exhibits altogether exceed those of
former years, it is said, and the fair prom
ises to be tie most noteworthy helJ by
the society.

MURDERED IN DEL NORTE
Charles Perry's Body Found by
Sheriff Ferguson Near
Crescent City.
Placer Miners Are Holding Captive a
Man Supposed to Be His
Slayer.
GRANTS PASS, Or., Aug. 31.âInfor
mation was received cere to-day from
Sheriff Fred Ferguson of Del Norte
County, Cal., that the body of Charles
Perry had been found in a well on the old
wagon road between Kerbyville, Or., and
Crescent City, Cal.
Perry had been employed at the Brown
Copper Company's smelter at Waldo, and
when the piaut was closed last spring for
improvements he was induced by a man
named Nealson to go with him to a sup
posedly rich placer claim about twenty
miles from Waldo, in the direction of the
coast. Perry, before starting on the trip,
asKed the advice of W. H. Wood, who had
charge of the smelter, and Wood advised
him not to go, as there were no placer
claims in California or Oregon that wouid
jcive 50 cents to the pan, as had been rep
resented by Nealson, and if a man haa a
claim half as rich he need never work a
/day.-
V "And," added ' Wood, . "I am an old
timer in Oregon, Charley. Beware of that
m!in."
; In spite of Wood's advice and warning
Perry left with his man. A few evenings
after their departure Nealson, it is claimed.
â Jfam'et, ftct /, Scene 4.
9howed up at Payne station and offered
Perry's watch for sale to t!>Â«' storekeeper,
who, luckily for justice, '...tight it and
afterward itloaman named Smith,
who carried it to Hum bold t County, Cal.
Wood, not hearing from his old smelter
employe, reported lii* suspicions to Sheriff
Ferguson of D-l Xorte County, Cal., nnd
also to the Sheriff of Josephine Covintv,
Or. The Del Norte Sheriff (Ferguson)
hearing about tne sale of the watch tol
lowea ap the clew and located the watch
in Humboldt County. Ferguson then
turned hia attention to the finding of
Perry's bi dv, for although the miner sus
1> â < ti d Nealson yet t:;ere was only the evi
dence of the watch against him and to
arrest him might defeat the ends of jus
tice.
In the meantime Nealson went to or
near Cresrent City to see his wife, from
whom he had I een separated. He told
her that his father had died in the Wil
lamette Yailev and iia<l leit him a small
fortune. He bought furniture and other
wise fitted up the house, but never sus
pected that the eyes of Fred Ferguson
were upon him night and day. Time
after time the Sheriff searched for Perry's
body, and after five months' perseverance
tie was rewarded by finding it yesterday in
an old well some distance from the Payne
sta c station.
Whether Nealson has been regularly ar
resied or not cannot be definitely ascer
tained, but word has reached here that
forty p'aeer miners have taken charge of
Nealson at Summit, and he is in danger
of lynching.
FIGHT NEAR CA RUT UERS.
Two Men Engage in a Bloody Combat
on the Plain*.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 31.â Zach D. Baker
and J. V. Clovd were brought to the
County Jail by Deputy Sheriff Timrnins
and Deputy Constabl â¢ Henry from Caru
thers, fifteen miles south of this city, early
thi> morning. The two men had fought a
desperate battle on the plains near Caru
thers, during which Baker almost cut
Cloyd's coat to pieces wih a razor, but
the blude failed to penetrate to the flesh.
Cloyd used rocks in defense, and cut a
severe Â»;ash in his opponent's scalp. He
is much smaller than Baker, and suffered
the most punishment. He was horribly
bruised about the face and his features
were unrecognizaole.
Each m:in claims that the other robbed
him of $80 wi.ile they were driving along
the road. Baker says that he gave Cloyd
the beating and used the razor on him to
get him to give up the troney he had
stolen. Baker had fallen asleep, and
claims that Cloyd then took the money
from his pocket. Cloyd, on the other
hand, says that it was a genuine case of
hold-up. He had $30 in his pocket and
Baker knew this. Baker demanded it,
and upon refusal began beating Cloyd
and slashing at him with the razor. Baker
finally overpowered him and took the
money.
The officers do not know which story to
believe.

IN THE PATH OF AN
AVALANCHE.
Bow'ders Started Down Toward
Them by a Volcanic
Disturbance.
SEVERAL OF THE PARTY ARE
INJURED.
Miss Fay Killingsworth Hurled Into
a Crevasse and Buried Beneath
Rocks and Earth.
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 31.â 1t was only
through mere chance â a miracle, some
might say â that the party of mountain
climbers that made the ascent of Mount
Hood last Wednesday was not buried be
neath an avalanche of rock and ashes.
There was an eruption as the party, of
which Wiliam Killingsworth and his
daughter, Miss Fay, were members, was
making the descent of the mountain, and
the wonder is not that only a few were in
jured, but that the party escaped at all.
The party, which consisted of twenty
one persons, had reached the summit of
Mount Hood in safety at about 3:40
o'clock in the afternoon, and bad started
down again, wlien it met with an expe
rience that none of its members will care
to pass through again. They had come to
a crevasse, some four feet deep, which
about half of their number had crossed,
when they were startled by a rumbling
sound resembling the roar of distant
thunder or artillery. The next instant
the earth trembled, and smoke and steam
were set n issuing from a lowering cliff di
rectly aoove them. The air seemed to be
tilled with flying rocks, and an avalanche
of bowlders came tearing down the moun
tainside directly toward the point where
the helpless little knot of mountaineers
were standing.
There was no time to think, no way of
escape, and no power on earth could stop
the downward flight of those leaping
bowlders. In an instant almost the aya
lanclie was upon them. One of the larg
est bow ders must have struck near Miss
Fay Kil ingsworth, who was stanuing be
tween her sisters Dora ami Nannie, for she
was listed into the air, her body being
twisted into a circle so that her hands and
feet touched, and thrown into a crevasse
some ten feet deep, where she was after
ward picked up unconscious. The bowl
der cleared this crevasse and theu con
tinue! its fisrht down the mountainside.
The rest of the party escaped more for
tunately.
The guide who accompanied the party
at once went to Miss KilJingsworth's res
cue. Upon getting down into the crevasse
into which she ha I been thrown he saw
only a piece of her dress. By dint of hard
work, however, he soon had her body un
covered.
The young lady's face and hands were
brui.-ed and bleeding and ~he was uncon
scious. A small Mask of brandy was the
only restorative at hand, and this was
applied in all haste, with the desired
result. Miss Kiliingsworth had to be
carried down the mountain, and then Dr.
Raffely was summoned by telephone from
Portland, as it was feared that she was
seriously and perhaps fatally injured.
The eruption lasted but a few minutes.
After the rocks and a3hes that were
tiirown up had fallen and the bowlaers
reached their destination at the foot of

the rocks, but none of them were seri
ously injured.
VANCOUVER'S NEW INDUSTRY.
Chosen as the Site for a Mammoth
Smelter, Lost to Tacoma Because
of the Silver Agitation.
TACOMA, Wash.. Aug. 31.â Manager
W. R. Rust of the Tacoma smelter .has
gone to Vancouver, B. C, to meet repre
sentatives of British and American capi
talists who are to locate there large sÂ«nelt
ing works, of which Mr. Rust will be man
ager.
A four-stack smelter is to be built, hav
ing a capacity of 400 tons of ore per day
and giving steady employment to 250 men.
British Columbia, Alaska and South
American ores are to be smelted. London,
Montreal and New York capitalists are in
terested in the enterprise, at the head of
which is C. D. Simpson, a wealthy coal
mine operator of Scranton, Pa.
Work will commence at once, that the
plant may be in operation within six
months.
Manager Rust isquotea as having stated
that the smelter goes to British Columbia
Instead of this State, because the British
capitalists interested would not invest
money in the United States at present
owing to the silver agitation.
Mr. Rust said before leaving that the
American tariff on silver and lead ores
also had much to do with it. Four
months ago it was intended to quadruple
the size of ihe Tacoma smelter at once,
but this improvement will now be delayed
until the currency question is settled.
The Vancouver company will have a
capital of $1,000,000, all of which ia re
ported to be paid in.

Large Crowds Assemble at Stations,

CHAUTAUQUA, N. V., Aug. 31.â Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan left Lakewood at 7:30
o'clock this morning on the little Ch&u
tauqua lake steamer Celeron, accompanied
bj a number of people from Jamestown.
At Beiuus Point the boat made a landing
Jong enough to permit the candidate to
shake hands with about a hundred people.
A crowd of about the same number greeted
him at Chautauqua landing, where the
Celeron arrived at 9:15 a. m. There were
cheers for Bryan and counter cheers for
Me Kin Icy.
Mr. and Mr<. Bryan were takei in charge
by Gay H. Fuller, postmaster, and dritren
around the famous assembly grounds. At
10 o'clock the Celeron with the Bryan
party on board left for Mayville. Before
leaving Chauiauqua Mr. Bryan made a
little speech.
RIPLEY, N. V., Aug. 31.â At Chau
tauqua Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were driven
about the grounds and the buildings
pointed out and described as well as the
system of educaiion. The party stopped
at the residence of Coleman E. Bishop,
former editor of the New York Judge and
ttie Buffalo Express, who is one of the
Chautaaqua liepublicans who will support
Bryan.
After leaving Mr. Bishop's Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan drcve to Prospect Park, where
Mr. Bryan, despite h:s assertion that he
would not speak, made a three-minute
speech to 500 people. He taid his visit
had no political significance. When he
found he was so near Chautauqua he
touid not withstand the temptation of
visiting the place, lie =aid he had a great
regard for the work done at Chautauqua
and that the Chautauqua platform was
broad tnounti to aliow the discussion of
every question. He thank d the people
for assembling. As he drove away he was
p.ven the Chautauqua salute, which is the
waving of handkerchiefs.
Mayville, wh eh is t..e home of Judge
Albion \V. Tuurt'ee, who is at present
stumping for Major -McKinley, was
reached at 10:30 a. m. Mr. Bryan spofce
here from the balcony of the hotel to 400
people, and his reference to Judge Totir
gee's books caused laughter I'rotn the
crowd that heard mm. He said that Mr.
Jefferson had the correct idea when he,
said that governments were founded in!
jealousy, not in confidence â that con
tidence was every where ihe parent of des-,
potism. Mr. Bryan continued:
Show me a people who are so confident in
their leaders that they take no part in the de
tai.s oi government and I will show you a
people who.-c leaders. look out for themselves
ana not the interests oi all the people. .Snow
me a people who, instead of having too much
confidence are jeuious oi their liberties, are
watchiul of their servants and careful as to
the policies proposed by the different varieties
and I w ill show > on a people mat have a good
Government. [Cheers.]
In this campaign' parties come to you with
their plaitorms outlining what they will do,
and Hi this campaign there is one great ques
tion which overshadows ail others â the money
question. On this question the two leading
parlies take positions entirely antagonistic to
each other. 'Ihe Republican pa. 'y declares in
Its platform that the gold standard must be
maiutained umil the leading commercial na
tions join witk us in Kubstiiutiii*; b.metallisru
for the gold standard. They don't say that a
gold standard is eood, but ssmpiy that we
must continue to have it until other nations
help us to secure something which the Re
publican platiorm admits to be better, nameiy,
bimetallism.
Now, the Democratic party takes an entirely
different position, lleretoiore it has been too
much the eus' :u for botn parties to tHke am
biguous positions and to straddle the ques
tion. This year they did not do that. Xne
Republican party has declared for tne mainte
nance of the gold standard until other nations
come to our relief. The Democratic party de
clares for the immediate restoration oi the
tree and unlimited coinage of cold and silver
at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1 without
waiting for the aid or consent oi any foreign
nation on earth. That makes the issue. The.
Democratic i>arty Bays that bimetallism is de
sirable and that it is desirable right now, and
ttiiit it is not only a gooJ thing, but it is a
good thing which cannot come tup high for
toe American people. [Cheers.]
It not only says that bimetallism is a good
thing, but ;iiat we ought to have it right now.
What ei.se does it do? In order that nobody
maymisunderatand.it declares that the peo
ple who are to secure bimetallism, are the
American peopie themselves, and that we are
not justified in waiting one single day for a
foreign nation to come to our help. The Dem
ocratic platform declares that the American
j.ccl>le should restore bimetallism for them
selves, whether other naiions a*d us aud cou
heiittoitor not. [Cheer*.]
I wantyou to tniuk over this money ques
tion and find out how it Â«il"ects you. You have
justaimnch right to find out how it affects
> â  ii a- m.y other class oi our people â as those
who lire engaged in negotiating with the Gov
ernment lor the sale of bonds on whicu the
peopie have to pay interest. The people have
a riphi to protest a^am-t such burdens. You
are lamiiiar with the aid expression oi making
bricks witnout straw.
I want to say to you, my friends, that no sys
tem, no policy lu.s been c nttived by the mind
Of man so calculated to make the toil: ng
mull make bricks without .Mraw as the gold
standard, [cheers] and I want to suggest to
iron that the man who goes to the financiers
und syndicate to secure their aid in restoring
a parly that is good for the American peop.e
g oes on a fool's errand. I thank you.
Mr. Bryan|bowed his (banks. Some one
In the crowd calied for "Tnree cheers for
William McK.nlev." and the cheers were
given with apparent good will.
Sir. Bryan arrived at itipley at 1:30 p. m.
after a rather uninteresting drive across
the country from Mayvilie. The candi
date and his wife took dinner at the house
of Lyman Bennett wi;h Hon. Charles Cor
bmt, a member of the Democratic fetate
Committee and other supporters.
Mr. Bryan made a si>eech to a large
crowd, and left for Cleveland over the
Lake Shore road at 3:05 p. m. His speech
was delivered in Taiimau"s Grove, where
the Knights of Maccabee were holding a
picnic. His audience numbered 2000, and
was fairly enthusiastic. Mr. Bryan wa3
introduced by the chief officer, W. 8.
Striimharn, who took care, however, to
!^y that he did not indorse him, but had
produced him here as an attraction for the
people. As the question was one on
which they desired to hear Mr. Bryan, he
hoped they would give him clone atten
tion. Mr. Bryan said:
I desire to sneak to you for just a short time
about this campaign. But before proceeding
to discuss any political questions I desire to
thank the members of this fraternity .lor the
p rivilege v hici. they have-given to me of meet
ng the people here as/emujed. I shall not nslc
jho members of the fraternity to indorse any
thing that I say. I recognize that the order is
non-partisan, as it must be, and therefore
politics s>hould have no place in its considera
tionâ is, so far as the order Is concerned;
although members of .ill orders must be, as
citizens, interested in any question that is be
lore the American people. Not only do I ap
preciate the courtesy which the .Maccabees
have extenued, but I appreciate the work
which that order and others are doing. I am
myself a member of some of the similar orders,
and 1 speak what 1 believe when I say they are
doing a great and important work among our
people. [Applause.]
Tn s is the last opportunity which I shall
have to say a word in the State of New York.
For the last week I have been traveling and
meeting the people. I am greatly pleased
With the interest which is being taken oy the
people of New York in the issue of this cam
paign. lam able to carry back to the people
of the West the news thai while we have not
met with a very hearty reception in Wall
street, we have met a hearty reception in every
other part of the State of New York. [Cheers.]
And I have come to belipve there is among the
masses of the people of Now York about as lit
tle love for Wull street as you will find in any
Western State. [Cheers.] And as this is my
farewell meeting in the btate for the present, I
desire to suDtnit just a word to the people of
New York. First, to the members of the Dem
ocratic parly: 1 have been gratified to rind
that so tew â few relatively the members of
the Democratic party are going to oppose the
platform and ticket nominated at Chicago. I
desire 10 bay a word to the Democrats ot this
State who believe that the State Convention
ought to indorse not only the candidates of trie
Chicago convention but the platform on which
these candidates btana. [Cheer.v]
If there Is any person here who thinks that
the Democratic party of the State of New York
ougnt not to indorse the candidates and plat
form what 1 shall .say is not addressed to such
persons, but to those who believe that the
State convention to be held in this State in
about two weeks should indorse both platform
and candidates I desire to offer one sugges
tion. We have had a great light in the Demo
cratic party â one oi the most memorable con
testsever waged in ihellnitedSiates â and those
who advocate the free coinage of silver huve
won. oy carrying their cause not to the con
ventions but to the people themselves, the
source of all political power. [Cheers.].
If we h&d waited until the convention as
sembled at Chicago and then made our appeal
to the delegates who hud been sent there unin
structed and without regard to the money
question we should have been defeated, but we
saw that the strength of bimetallism was in
the rank and fiie of the party.
ii you want the state convention to support
the Chicago plniform and ticket there is only
one way to be sure of it and thtt is not to let
any man go to any convention, great or small,
uniil you Know When ne stands on this ques
tion, and know that he stands by you. [Ap
plause.] No man who wants to" uo what is
right will refuse to let the people know what
he will do when he gets to the convention.
The men who assemble at conventions ao not
go mere as individuals. They go to act for
you who send them. And you not only have a
right to know what a man is going to no when
he gets there, butyou have a right to tell him
what 'o do and to bind him witn instructions
to do it. I do not, in making these suggestions,
mean to advise any of you how he shall act in
regard to the indorsement of the action taken
by the Democratic National Convention, but
simply wish to suggest u> you that if you wish
to indorse that convention that Is the only
way you will be sure. That is the way in
which this fight must be carried on ii the
people are to have their wishes expressed in
the convention. 1 have not in this campaign
Insisted that a Democrat shall vote lor me
merely because I was nominated by the Demo
cratic party. I have Insisted that a Democrat
who believes that the success of this ticket
nominated at Chicago would be best for h.s
country, best for himself, best for his family
and best for his neighbor, should regard the
ticket as having such a claim upon him that he
would have to support it. [Applause.]
And 1 have been willing 10 concede that any
Democrat who conceives that the election of
anybody cisc would be belter lor the country
than the election of the Chicago ticket has a
perfect right to make his vote express what he
thinks, but when I concede to the Democrats
the right to leave their party, to desert their
ticKet and to support somebody else, 1 apply
that same doctrine of independence to mem
bers oi other parties, and ii a Democrat who is
engaged in some big syndicate has a righi to
leave the Democratic party because the Repub
lican party is a friend of syndicates, then
members oi the Republican [arty who do not
want the country to be ruinod by syndicates
have a right to aesdrt the publican party.
There are things in our platiorin which are
offensive to some people, They were pui there
on purpose to offend Mine people. There is an
cl i baying: "No thief ever felt the halter draw
with good opinion of the law."
No person who thinks that it is the great
privilege of this Government to turn over the
instrumentalities of this Government to a lew
people in order that they may prosper while
tne masses tell without recompense is not
likely to be pUased with that plank * in the
platforsa which says that the Democratic
part* is opposed to Hie issue of bonds in times
of ptiiCe a..d to trafficking with syndicates
which at a high price attempt to sustain the
treasury of the United States. They were
never expected to like that. It was not put in
to make mem -:!.. l. it was put in because the
Democratic party intends to drive away these
people and to stop the business of legislation
lor their advantage.
The remainder of Mr. Bryan's speech
was devoted to an argument on the silver
question, covering the grounds which his
former speeches have made lamiiiar to
the public.
JOVRA Mil' i> JMO 01110.
Bryan Inflictt I'poit Hearer* His btale
f>ucteen-to- One Joke.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 31.â The
journey made by Candidate Bryan from
Itipley. N. V., to Cleveland was marked
principally hy a fluttering demonstration
at Ashtabula, Ohio, where nearly 3000
â people gathered about his car and cheered
him with a vim. Previous to reaching
Ashtabula the candidate was cheered at
Northeast, Pa., where a number of people
also shook his hand. The hand-shaking
process was repeated in the station at
Erie, Pa., where the train stopped ten
minutes.
At Conneaut the first stop was made in
Major McKinley's Slate, and here Mr. !
and Mrs. Bryan were greeted by Daniel j
McConville, chairman of the Democratic i
Executive Committee of Ohio. There was i
no mistaking the heartiness of the Ashta- !
bula reception. Cheers were continuous !
and they came with increased vigor when j
Mr. Bryan referred to Republicans chang
ing their politics in this campaign. Ash
tabula has been a stronghold of Repub
licanism since the days before the war.
Here Mr. Bryan opened his Ohio cam
paigii. Mr. and Mrs. Bryan went out on
the rear platform of the car, and cheers
were called for and given for the United j
States flag and lor Mrs. Bryan. Mr. Bryan
eaid:
I understand that this is one of the places
where it is not necessary for a Democrat to
speak, as there are Republicans here who are
running the campaign and making the
speeches and they do not need anybody to
come in from the ontside. My friends, I recog
nize your salute to the fl ig, and I stand upon
a platform which declares that the people who
owe allegiance to that flag are the only people
who have a rit?m to say what our policy shall
be. In this country, where you have so many
instances of Republicans who are coming out
for free silver, I want you to ask yourselves
one question: If this lree-sllver sentiment is
a craze; if it has no substantial foundation; I
it, as our opponents say, it is founded on dis
honesty and ignorance, I want to ask I
you how it is that honest - thinking i
Republicans are willing to leave the associa- !
tions of a lifetime in order to stand by the:
free coinage of silver? Why is it that you can j
find any number of men who in the last three I
mouths by study hMve come to believe in that !
to which they were opro'ed? [A voice, "Be- I
cause they nre honest."] And how is it that !
you cannot find a Democrat who was for free '
silver three months ago and who is opposed to I
it now, unless he is a man who hns a pecuniary
reason tor deser.iiiK the Democratic party'?
We have a cause that appeals to the intellect !
of the American people. We have a cause that '
appeals to the hearts of the American people,
and lor every Democrat who goes away from
the Democratic party because of its altitude
on the money question, because of its opposi
tion to bond issues and because it is in lavor
of controlling and suppressing trusts in this
country, we expect sixteen to take his place
[Voice in the crowd, "Sixteen to one."]
Sixteen to one has several meanings; but
one of the meanings of sixteen to one, and the
one which our opponents fear most, is that we
will get sixteen men for every one we lose
[Cheers and laughter.] You people have dis
cussed b nd issues, and i want to ask you my
friends, whether the citizens of this country 1
who moil be taxed to pay every dollar of the '
,000,000 of bonds issued-itlie working
man, the laboring man, the wealth-producing
class, the business menâ not as much !
riant to protest by their votes against bond
issues as the syndicates have to fas:en that
policy upon the Government for another ad
minis-ration. Our platform declares against
these bond issues.
The Republican platform i-? silent on the
subject, and there is not a prominent Repub
lican who dared to raise his vole* against the
financial policy oi the present administration, i
If we must lose the Democrats who have 1
profiled by bond issues, why ought not we to â¢
gain the Kepublicana who We suffered an.d i
THE SAN FRAJN CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1596.
i will suffer by those Issues. Are there any Re
| publicans in this crowd? [Shouts of "No."]
Are there any men in thin crowd whotiave
been Republicans? [?h >uts of "Yes."] If
there are any Republicans here who are going
tot vote the Democratic t'eket, litt up your
I hands. [Laughter and uprising of ha'ids.] I
am R'ftd io know that. Now I commission you
to get out as missionaries mid to bring
this doctrine before nil the people of your
county. This is a political campaign, it is
j developing more public speaking than any
, campaign that we have had since the war.
I Some of our opponents are afraid that if we
have free coinage of silver we are goinic to be
; tioubled with a fifty-cent dollar. It will be a
; new experience to a few people to be troubled
i with any kind of dollars. [Laughter anil ap
; plause.] We do no! expect the silver dollar to
i be a titty-cent dollar. We expect that with
I the opening of our mints to iree silver every
ounce oi silver will be worth $1 29.
S mie one asked the candidate a ques
tion on the silver question when he con
cluded his address, and after Mr. Bryan
answered this a number of other questions
i bearing on the main issue of the campaign
i were put to him by other people, his reply
I in each case bringing clieera from the
1 crowd.
Meanwhile a^ lively scene was going on
around a window of the car out of which
Mrs. Bryan leaned and dLtribut d flowers
; from bouquets that had been presented to
her. Men and women foucht for blos
soms and the sci amble was at its height
i when the train moved out, followed by
J tremendous cheering. The next stou w.is
: at Geneva, where several hundred people
were gathered, and more handshaking and
cheering took place.
Madison had a unique reception which
: Mr. Bryan seemed to enjoy heartily. The
members of the Madison McKinley Club,
bearing their banner and wearing McKin
ley badges, marched up to the train and
gave three hearty cheers for the Republi
can candidate. The train moved out be
fore there was an opp rtunity lor any
thing further, and Mr. Bryan waved his
hat at ins enthusiastic opponents as he
sped on his westward journey.
At Painesville a committee from the
Cleveland Sorosis, headed by Mrs. N. Coe
Stewart, its president, boarded the train,
laden with flowers for Mrs. Bryan, who is
president of the Lincoln branc of
the organization. Ex-Congressman M.
A. Foran and others from Cleve
land aho joined Mr. Bryan there.
The Painesville audier.ee numbered
about 800 and showed much enthusiasm.
Mr. Bryan was called on for a speech
and in reply said: "There is only one
j issue in the campaign which the people
seem desirous to hear anything about.
; That is the money question, and the great
| point that comes into discussion on that
i question is whether this Nation shall
; have its own financial policy and by its
! own people, or whether it will let others
decide for them."
There was a handful of people to cheer
the candidate at the pretty village of
Mentor, famous as the home of Garlield.
Willoughby, farther on, furnished
amusement to the candidate's party by
tiie zeal and activity displayed by the 2tX)
people gattier-d there to get a chmpse of
Mr. Bryan. The candidate's car stopped
j thort of tne station and a rush was made
| to tet to the platform wuere he was
I standing. Unfortunately for many a
I fence was in the way, and over this men,
! women and children scrambled with dis
| regard for appearance. Most of them ac
| complished their ot.j^ct, however, and
shook hands with Mr. Bryan.
GREAT CROWDS AT CLEVELAND.
Jiryan Receives a ltig Send- Off During
Hi* Exhibition There.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, Aug. 31.â The wel
come given W. J. Brvan by the people of
Cleveland to-night was unprecedented in
his campaign tour from New York to his
home in Nebraska. Beyond doubt it was
the most macniheent and most gratifying
reception ever accorded to the young can
didate, exceeding in heartiness even the
greeting of the city of Buffalo last Friday,
and that was an oration of which any man
might well be proud.
Arriving at Lake Shore station, he found
packed as closely as anything short of act
ual suffocation would allow in and about
the station thousands of people whoÂ«e im
pulse seemed to be to cheer and shout
with all the power of their lungs in honor
of the Democratic candidate. All day
long the interest of the va?t crowds that
thronged the streets had been whetted by
po itical meetings on corners, addressed
by regularly assigned speakers, and the
arrival of Bryan contingents from Canton
and other places had augmented the ai
ready overcharged feelings of political in
terests. Fifteen sections composed one
excursion train that brought enthusiastic
bilverite-i to see the show, and it is claimed
that TuOO people came from Canton alone,
and included in this was the Canton
Bryan and Sewall Club, numbering 2000
men. Many other Bryan and Sewall clubs
came from towns In Ohio and Pennsyl
vania, nearly all brineing bands of music.
Ten thousand people had gathered in
and about the Lake Shore station to await
the arrival of the nominee's train, and
when it arrived they shouted with a vim
that showed their earnestness. An open
carriage drawn by four white horses was
in waiting for Mr. and Mrs. Bryan and in
t::is they were conveyed through streets
crowded with cheering people to the Hol
lenden Hotel, followed by more than a
score of other carriages containing mem
bers of the local committee and escorted
by silver clubs from many of the Cleve
land wards. A National salute was tired
by Battery A, Onio National (iuard, as the
train came in and fireworks displayed all
alone the route to the hotel. More than
2000 cheering, yelling men and boys clung
close to the nominee's carriage from the
depot to the hotel. When the carriage
reached the Centennial arch erected in
commemoration of CleveianJ'3 one hun
dreth anniversary as a Settlement, the
magnificent structure burst into a flood of
light, furnished by a myriad of electric
g obes.
Afier a hasty dinner at the Hollenden
Mr. Bryan was escorted by maoy of the
local and visiting silver clubs through
highways packed closely with people to
the Central Armory, an immense struc
ture, capable oi seating more than nOuO
people. But double that number were
crowded in the auditorium. As Mr.
Bryan entered he wus given such an ova
tion as few men rarely receive. Cheer
after cheer went up and the people forgot
their suffocating position in their desire
to shout. After some, time Mr. Bryan
was allowed to speak.
There was nothing new in the address
delivered by the young orator, but he put
a fervor into his words and gestures that
gave the audience every opportunity of
ventine its enthusiasm. The speech
there was the principal one delivered by
Mr. Bryan during tne evening. Most of
the crowd left tiie armory when he had
concluded, leaving a comparatively small
number to hear Hon. M. A. For&n and
Thomas U. Fitzsimmons.
It was tl;e Â«arae scene of enthusinsm
over atrain at Music Hall, where Mr. Bry
and went immediately from the armory.
Ten thousand more people were there aiid
they cheered turn as heartily and as fre
quently as those at the armory had done.
Back to the Hollenden Hotel the candi
date was hurried from Muh;c Hail and
from the balcony he delivered a third ad
dress to the vast concourse of people gath
ered in ttie open streets. When he con
cluded and stepped back the crowd pressed
into the lobby of the hotel and managed
to corral ti:e candidate, who shook hands
with so many that he was fairly exhausted
when he made his escape.

ALL TO BATTLE
AGAINST BRYAN,
Sound - Money Democrats
Gathering for Their
Rally.
TEXAS MEN ARE FIRST
Not Dscided as to Whether a
Third National Ticket Should
Be Named.
KENTUCKIANS EMBARRASSED.
Although Supporters of Henry Wat
terson, the State's Delegates
Cannot Nam: Him.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 31.â The
delegates to the sound-uionev Democratic
convention beuan arriving this morning.
The fir>t to come wa3 that from Texas.
There appears to be among the Texan
delegates some difference of opinion as to
whether or not a National Democratic
ticket should be named. The Northwest
sent its first delegate in the person of
Henry Vellmer, Mayor of the city of
Davenport. Although that city usually
gives a Democratic majority, in the
opinion of Mr. Veller it will this year give
McKinley 20,000 or 30.000. "lowa will not
go for Bryan," sa'.d Mayor Vellmer.
The Kentucky delegation will arrive to
morrow. Members of the delegation are
in a somewhat embarrassing position.
When the Kentucky State Convention
was held about ten days ago the only
ticket talked about was Bragg and
Buckner and the convention adopted an
enthusiastic resolution indorsing General
Buckner for Vice-President. The delegates,
therefore, wiU come to the National Con
vention pledged to Buckfier. They are all
good frienda of Henry Watterson and
since his boom has assumed such larpe
proportions they are said to be disposed to
keep quiet and let matters take their
course. The resolution of the State Con
vention, however, estops them from pre
senting Watterson and his name will
therefore have to be brought before the
convention from another State.
Strangely the Wisconsin delegation
finds itself in a somewhat similar predica
ment. It will come here instructed for
Bragg and find a healthy boom on the
ground for Senator Vilas.
Judge M. L. Crawford of Dallas, Tex., a
prominent member of tiie Texas delega
tion, says there is unquestionably a senti
ment in the State against another ticket.
"The reason for this sentiment," said
Judge Crawford, "is that the sound-money
Democrats of Texas are confident they
can defeat Bryan by being allowed to vote
as they please. Some of them thought it
would be a good idea for the National
Convention to pass a resolution giving
t^is privilege to Texas Democrats, but the
masses think this would be a mistake. If
a man does not want to vote for the third
ticket there is no power to, force him to do
so. There is no doubt in my mind that
the Populists and Republicans of Texas
will luse. The former are as badly dis
gruntled as the Populists are in Kentucky
over the treatment they have received
from Bryan's managers.
'The leaders of the Populist party in
Tex;Â»s say that Bryan, after making a play
for their support, has now turned his baok
upon them, so far as any material recogni
tion is concerned, believing he will get
their votes anyhow. Last year they polled
about 140.0UU votes in the State election.
The Republicans there have never been
well organized, and have never shown
their re;tl strength. With these three
forces aguinst Bryan 1 don't believe he can
possibly carry the State."
The Judge thinks the Texana are for
Bragg first for President. After him they
prefer Vilas. Tor Vice-President they are
for Buckner by all means.
The Minnesota delegation arrived this
afternoon. It is understood they will pre
sent for the Vice-Presidency the name of
1). W. .Lawier, the chairman of the Minne
sota delegation at the Chicago convention
and the Democratic National Committee
man from that State, whose sound money
views, as expressed at Chicago, excited so
much antagonism among the silver men.
This afternoon the members of the ex
ecutive committee agreed to recommend
to the full National Committee the selec
tion of ex-Governor Flower of New York
as temporary chairman, and to endeavor
to have the committee on permanent or
ganization select Senator Caffery for per
manent chairman.
The hotel corridors began to fill up this
evening, and tne town took on an ante
convention look. Ten delegates from
lowa, who arrivpd this evening, favor the
nomination o; Watterson.
The executive committee met to-night,
but took no action, except to allot the
press seats and arrange some minor de
tails iar the convention. The suggestion
has bin made that the platform be con
fined to tne money issue alone, but there
is little doubt that it will be made to cover
the whole political situation. Its chief
feature will be a refutation .of the free
silvor plank of the Chicago platform, and
a strong declaration for sound money and
the preservation of the gold standard.
A reply will also be made to the atti
tude of the Chicago convention on the
constitutional Dowers of the Supreme
Court and the executive. Its tariff plank
will, it is said, be modVlol after that of the
Democratic platform of 1892.
Hon. J. H. Kckels, Comptroller of the
Currency, was one of the arrivals this
evening. He is sanguine concerning the
personnel and resu.ts of the convention.
"lrom what I can learn," he said, "the
convention will fully represent the sound
money sentiment of the Democratic party,
and the attendance will be all that could
be expected. I think the committee on
resolutions will have no easy task. There
will be more suggestions lor planks to go
before it than have been presented to any
committee at any convention this year.
The Illinois convention adopted a "good
platform and our peopie will demand a
strong expression upon the tariff."
When asktd about the situation in Il
linois Mr. Eckels said: "1 believe that
McKinley's majority will be over 100 000.
My own county, La Salle, is a fair sam[ le
of the condition of things. It is the
largest county outside of Cook and gives'
toe largest Democratic majority u-ually.
Of the 8000 voters who cast their baliota
ior Cleveland in 1592, at least iiUO-will not
vote for Brvan. On the other Hand there
are not ->0u Republicans who will vote for
him. The opposition to Bryan among
Democrats is not confined to the Germans
alone, but the old-line Irish Democrats as
well refuse to support him.
Colonel J. M. Martin of lowa, who has
been active in his State in the interot of
tbe sound-money convention, says that
the outlook for the cause in lowa is very
hdglit. The silver feeling, he admitted,
was still strong in certain sections, but he
declared that the tide had chanced and
the t:r>\<i sentiment was gainin-.'. Colonel
Martin said that while the lowa delega
tion presumably had no preference as to
the Presidential candidate for the sound
money Democrats J. .Sterling Morton was
the choice of a number oi" delegates.
Colonel J. B. Falkner of Montgomery,
Ala, said: "The enthusiasm manifested at
our State Convention *to nominate dele
gates to Indianapolis surprised every one
and the silverites who were laughing at us
a week aeo have now become alarmed."
The Cleveland boom received a decided
impetus to-night when Hugh Wallace of
\Y ashinuton, a delegate to tue convention,
reached here. He said that what the con
vention should, and in his opinion would
do, was to nominate Cleveland. "There
are many reasons," continued the Pacific
Coast politician, "for this course. The
convention should be looking for the vote
getter and beyond question Cleveland is
500,000 votes stronger than any man who
can be named. It would be wise policy,
too.
"It would relieve the convention of the
charge now made against it of being bolt
ers. With Cleveland as the candidate this
convention wouid go before the country
a; the regular performance with Mr.
Bryan as the sideshow. I know that the
acceptance of the nomination by Cleve
land would necessitate a sacrifice on his
part, but if there ever was a time in the
history of the country when a man should
make a sacrifice lor its wellare now is that
time."
TO SPEAK ON LABOR DAY
Candidate Kryan Hill Journey to Chi-
cago /or J hat l'tirpoae.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 31.â The trouble
some question whether or not William J.
Bryan will remain in Chicago from Sep
tember 4 to 7 and address the union work
ingmen on the latter day, which is Labor
day, according to a promise he made dur
ing the convention, was settled to-day by
the receipt of a telegram from the nomi
nee stating he would speak here Labor
day. This news was received by Chair
man Jones in response to an inquiring
message. The meeting will be held in
Sharpshooters' Park in the afternoon. Mr.
Bryan will arrive September 4, and no ar
rangements have yet been made for
speech-making iv or out of Chicago be
tween that day and Labor day. The time
will probably be spent at headquarters in
conferences and in resting. Mr. Bryan
has to be in Lincoln, Nebr., September 8,
to be formally notified of his nomination
by the Silver party committee, and he
will leave Chicago the night of the 7th.
Chief McConvilie of the speakers' bureau
left the city to-day for Columbus, Ohio,
where he will meet Mr. Bryan and ascer
tain his speaking plans.
George P. Keeney, president of the Na
tional association of silver clubs and sec
retary of the silver party committees, ar
rived here to-day to open party head
quarters, probably at the' Clifton House,
and to arrange for the National conven
tion of silver clubs which will De held in
Battery D. September 23. He is a member
of the Democratic advisory committee
and will be here almost continuously until
election day. He iaid clubs were sending
in notices of organization at the rate of
100 a day.
Congressman Towne and ex-Lieutenant-
Governor Day, both silver Republican
nominees for Congress in Minnesota,
against whom a bitter light is bein-r made,
were callers at Democratic headquarters
and had short talks with Senator Jones.
They a^ked for a liberal supply of silver
speakers and literature, and both were
sanguine of overcoming their political
foes.
A labor bureau in connection with the
National Committee will probably be
established here this week.
In response to the appeal recently issued
by Chairman Jones for popular subscrip
tions mr.r.y are now being received by
Treasurer St. John at New York hend
quarters. Senator Jones to-day asked for
the announcement to be made that all
weekly and daily papers favoring Mr.
Bryan start popular subscriptions in their
columns. Such editors are authorized to
act as collecting aeents and to forward the
contributions received to Treasurer St.
John, Hotel Banholdi, New York. Edi
tors of all Democratic and free-silver pa
pers are requested to send copies of their
papers regularly to Secretary Adams of
the press bureau in this city.
Senator Teller will make his opening
speech of the campaign in Illinois at Mor-
TiSon next Monday.
GENERAL WEALER'S ID EA
Says Hryan Will /Secure a Hig Majority
in loti.t.
DEP MOINES, lowa, Aug. 31.â General
J. B. Weaver declares in an interview that
lowa will go at least 30,000 to 35,000 for
Bryan. He said:
"There are hundreds of silver Repub
licans in every county in the State. I
found them wherever I have spoken this
fall. In 1892 the vote of the State was in
round figures 219.000 Republican, 196,000
Democratic and 20,000 Populists. Now the
Democrats and Populists have fused. This
win leave 3000 Republican majority over
the combined opposition. There will be
at the lowest estimate 20.000 Republicans
who will so for Bryan. This is a ridicu
lously low estimate. It makes the Demo
cratic total 23Â»i,000. There will not be to
exceed 10,000 McKinley Democrats in the
btate. Add this number to the Republi
can strength after deducting the number
of Republicans who will vote for Bryan
and then deduct it from the Democratic
total of 236 000, and we will hava about
17,000 majority for Bryan. This does not
take into account the Prohibition vote,
which "will be a considerable factor, for
most of it is silver, and it amounts to 12,
-000. The State will surely go for Bryan,
and my conservative estimate of the
majority is 30,000 to 35,000."

SYRACUSE, N. V., Auk. 31.â The con
vention of the Democratic Reform Or
ganization of the State was called to order
in the Alhambra Rink at 11:33 p. K. to
day. Daniel G. Grillin of Watertowu was
chosen temporary chairman. Mr. Griffin
delivered an able address, in the course of
which he praised the conduct of the New
York delegation at the Chicago conven
tion and paid tribute to President Cleve
land, whom he alluded to as ''the bravest
President, and loved ior the enemies he
had made."
The speaker was frequently applauded,
but when he referred to Grover Cleveland
the delegates for the first time forgot
themselves and stood up and gave three
cheers for Grover Cleveland.
When Mr. Griffin had finished the list
of delegates to ihe Indianapolis conven
tion was read. There were no delegates
present from the counties of Allegheny,
Chenango, Essex, Franklin, Genesee,
Green, Livingston, Niagara, Orleans, Put
nam, Schobarie, Sullivan. Tio^a and War
ren. The usual committees were named
and a recess was taken at 12 :30 to 1 o'clock.
The convention did not reassemble un
til 3:42 p. m. Charles S. Fairchild was
chosen permanent chairman, and the fol
lowing delegates at large to Indianapolis
were named: Roswell P. Flower, Edward
M. Shepard, General Charles Tracey and
General G. Magee.
The platform was then read. It is a
lengthy document. It repudiates "the
Chicago platform and its supplement, the
Populist platform, adopted at St. Louis,
because both violate and attack all Demo
cratic principles." It likewise repudiates
the nominations of the Chicago conven
tion. It declares that the "maintenance
of the constitution in its integrity, the
preservat.on of the National credit unim
paired and the National honor unsullied,
the freedom of the individual to engage in
all pursuits of life unhampered by the in
tereference of parental government, and
the right of every citizen to receive
tne reward of his labor undiminished
by a debased standard of value, are funda
mental and essential principles of the
Democratic party."
Mr. Bryan is stated to be standing upon
the Populist platform, and the declara
tion adds: "He actively sought the Popu
list nomination. Having obtained it, he
has never rejected it and be has never re
pudiated the declarations of the Populist
platform."
The outburst of sectional hate which at
tended the adoption of the Chicago plat
form is deplored, and the platform pays:
"Every speech he (Bryan) delivers is filled.
with lnflamm-itory appeals to the poor
against the rich in a basÂ«, un-American
and anti-social effort to obtain votes by
creatinsr and stimulating a passionate
class hatred among our people. 1 '
A strong appeal is made to "our Demo
cratic fellow-citizens to seriously consider
this which is the gravest of pending elec
tions. How long can our Democratic in
stitutions endure this assault upon them? '
Reference is made to the proposition to
change the make-upof the Supreme Court,
restrictions of executive power, etc. The
platform then says: "We repudiate the
Chicago platform because it proposes to
substitute for our present standard of
value, which is equal to the best In the
world, an unstable and depreciated stand
ard, which has been rejected by every
civilized and prosperous and commercial
nation, and which would put us on a mon
etary level with China, Mexico and other
countries where labor is notoriously un
derpaid."
The Chicago platform, it says, declares
against gold monometallism and advo
cates legislation which must inevitably
lead to silver monometallism; itavdocates
a monetary system which would offer an
unlimited field of speculation to the capi
talist, but would materially reduce the
purchasing power of every dollar paid to
the wstie-earners.
The administration of President Cleve
land is heartily commended and the Re
publican system of protection condemned.
The platform further says:
"We believe that the Federal Govern
ment should be directly divorced from the
business of banking, and therefore demand
the repeal of all laws authorizing the issue
of legal tender or treasury notes by toe
Government, or the reissuing of such notes
when tsiey have once been redeemed in
gold. We favor the enactment by Con
cress of such legislation as will permit the
establishment of a banning currency
ample in volume for the need of business,
readily adjusting itself to such needs, ab
solutely securing every contingency and
at all times redeemable in gold."
It is declared that the Indianapolis con
vention should nominate Democratic can
didates ok a Democratic platform, aud
then hearty support is pledged.
The convention adjourned, subject to
meet in Brooklyn September 24 to nomi
nate candidates for State offices and trans
act other necessary business.
SENATOR TELLER ON THE STUMP.
Attempts to Justiftt â¢"*Â« Hotting Act at
St. Louii.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Aug. 31.â
Henry M. Teller, Colorado's veteran Sen
ator, was accorded the biggest reception
here to-day that has ever been sqoymi to
any man in a campaign in the city. With
the exception of Colorado Springs it has
been generally granted that the State is
almost unanimous for Bryan and Sewall,
and the meeting here was made the chief
gathering of the campaign. The address
delivered to-ni^ht is the only speecu tiiat
the Senator i? expected to make in Colo
rado this campaign.
The Senator arrived from Denver at 4
o'clock accompanied by members of his
family, and was met at Palmer Lake by a
reception committee, at the head of which
was Hon. Irving Howbert, late chairman
of the Republican Stat- Committee and
one of the big CrippO Creek gold-mine
owner?. His arrival was awaited by at
least 3000 people, and as the train pulled
in salutes were tired from cannons and two
braÂ«s bands played "Hail to the Chief."
After a parade through the streets the
Senator was driven to ihe Antlers Hotel,
where he addressed an audience of 5000
people from a balcony, lie spoke but
briefly touching the financial question, i
At the Coliseum to-night an audience of
3000 people assembled to hear him speak.
The gathering was under the auspice^ of
the Bryan and Sewall Club of this city,
and Mayor .Plunjb. a Republican, pre
sided. Prominent citizens occupied the
stage, irrespective of old parly lines. The
big building had been handsomely deco
rated for the occasion, aud as the Senator
stepped on the platform he was showered
with bouquets and greeted wit thunder*
ona applause and cheers, which lasted
several minutes. '<â 
Senator Tell >r spoke for two hours, and
at the conclusion of his speech ex-Senator â 
Reap an of Texas made a short talk. It is
estimated that 4000 people were packed in \
the building, while hall of that number â 
failed to gain admission and were turned â 
away. An overflow meeting was held at ; ;
the Courthouse, which was addressed by
local speakers.
Senator Teller announced that his ad
dress was his justification to his constitu
ents for boltiii.;! the Si. Louis convention,
if such a justification is needed. He spoke
of his long connection with the Republi
can party and said that be had stood with
it, because it stood for the best interests of
humanity, that he did not leave it until
his mature judgment so advised him. In
speaking of the demonetization of silver
in 1573 he cited Conkling and Blame to
show that the greatest statesmen did not
know that it had been done until three
ycars'afier. He asked the voters if they
believed s.hat under the Republican party
with such recruits as Whitney, Gray and
others there would be any change from
the present conditions.
In answer to those who believed that
help could come to silver through .McKin
ley he said that he respected him as a
m<to, but that he would have no respect
foriiim if he was elected on a platform
and then failed to carry it out. ' The
chances, ha said, are that' Cleveland, if he
votes at all next November, will vote for
McKinley. In answer to questions the
Senator gave a long discussion to the
standing of the silver-using countries as
against the gold-using countries, showing
that the silver countries are now prosper
ous. He paid a clowing tribute to William
J. Bryan, saying that he was the peer in
personal integrity and intelligence to any
man who has been nominated since he en
tered public life.
Senator Teller's speech aroused . great
enthusiasm among his audience, who were
extremely liberal with their applause and
cheers.

LITTLE ROCK. Auk., Aug. 31.â ThÂ«
State Populist Central Committee issued a
long address to the voters ye>ierd:iy. After
arraigning the Democracy for all the
vices known to the criminal calendar, the
address says:
This question of personal liberty is of more
j importance just now than any question of
j finance or tariff. To be a "free man 1 ' is of
j more importance than baring "free silver."
The Democratic party Is wholly responsible
for the present vicious, barbarous, un-Ameri
can, undemocratic election iaws, and some oi
the leaders, even though they profess to iavor
honest elections, are largely responsible for its
present condition. They oppose any amend
ment looking to any improvement or modifi
cation. Then, if reform is to be had, it will
! not and cannot be had by electine the Demo
i cratic ticket
We appeal to all honest men, whether Demo
crats, Republicans, Populists or Prohibition
ists, to vote for no man who is not in favor of
honest elections. Defeat with your honor un- â¢
sullied is better than success clouded by fraud.
The hope for reform and relief depends upon
our party.

Jourdan, the president of the company,
on the consent of all parties, was named

opportunity to catch up in some slight
measure with t:.c mass of correspondence
which has accumulated since his letter of

delegations were slated for to-day and the
individual callers were few.
The Major is still being overwhelmed
with congratulations on the tenor of his
letter. Among the many opened to-day
was this letter from Senator Allison of
Iowa :
"I want to congratulate you on yonr

FENTILATING THE SE NATE.
Every Seat in the. Chamber to Be Sup
plied With Fresh Air.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 31. -Work
on the new system of ventilation in the
United States Senate chamber is well ad
vanced. The floors of the galleries and
the Senate have been removed, and iron
and yellow pine rafters, under which ven
tilation apparatus is to be located, has
been put in place to receive the new floor
me as soon as the ventilating pipes have
been supplied.
The great ventilating pit, communi
cating through an underground passage
with ihe granite shaft west of the north
wine of the Capitol, is exposed to view.
It was over this pit. sixty feet deep and
twice the diameter of an ordinary well,
that Senator Hill sat until he removed to
a place on the west end of the Democratic
side of the chamber.
R fitting the Senate with a system of
ventilation will probably be completed
before November 1, but time will be re
quired in placing the somewhat intricate
apparatus, which will convey fresh air to
every seat in the chamber, on the floor
and in the galleries.
Perilous Phy?tt of a hake Steamer.
GRINDSTONE CITY, Mich., Aug. 31.â
The steamer Michigan ran ashore one

HIS CLOTHES IN FAMES
A Bridgeport Man Rends the
Early Morning Air With
His Shrieks.
It Is Thought the Unfortunate Was
the Victim of a Fiendish
Practical Joke.
BRIDGEPORT, Cora., Aug. 31.â About
3:30 o'clock yesterday morning cries of
agony aroused the firemen who were
sleeping in No. 5 engine-house. They
sprang from their beds and, rushing to
the street, saw a horrible sight.
A man, all enveloped in flames, was
lying in the gutter a few steps from the
entrance to the engine-house. His cloth
ing was burning fiercely and he was
shrieking in agony..
Before the fire could be put out the
clothing was nearly burned off the unfor
tunate victim, and he was so terribly
burned that he was uncon.-cious.
The victim proved to cc Sydney Wil
son, a young colored man living in Soutli
port. He was at once taken to the general
hospital, but the doctors there, after an
examination, said that there was no hope
for him.
Nothing definite is known as to the ori
gin of the fire. Wilson is entirely uncon
scious and can throw no light on it. The
doctors do not expect him to regain con
sciousness.
The generally accepted theory is that he
was the victim of some practical joker.
It was known that Wilson had been
drinking on Saturday n;<*ht and he was
probably drunk. It is thought that some
of his companions, probably as drunk as
himself and reckless of the consequences,
poured oil on his clothing and set it on
fire, thinking that it would be a joke on
the firemen. The police are making etrong
efforts to discover the guilty parties.
UNIFORMED PI THJAJt'S.
Thousands of Knights Encamped for a
Wt-elt y*ar JUinncapalis.
MINNEAPOLIS. Minn., Aug. 31.â The
inter.-tate encampment of the Uniform
Rank of the Knights of Pythias opened to
day. No finer encampment grounds have
ever been secured in any city than those
of Camp Yale, which this week is the
home of thousands of uniformed Knights.
The tents s.re high and dry above the
ground and furnished with good floors,
each tent being lighted with incandescent
lights. The Minnesota Brigade, Colonel
E. H. Milham commanding, assembled to

RACE WAR IN ALABAMA.
Pitched Battle Between White* and a Mob
of Segroet.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 31.â A Jour
nal ppecial from Camp Hill, Ala., says: A
serious riot is reported near here. Some
country peace officers had arrested ssv
eral negroes and were taking them to
jail when a body of negroes attacked the
oifici r3 and undertook to rescue the pris
oners.
The officers were re-enforced by a num
ber of white residents and a pitched battle
followed, turns, axes and fence rails being
the weapons used.
Ihe negroeÃ finally retreated, but not,
however, until several of their number
were killed and several wounded. One
white man is said to have been killed.
The trouble is believed not to be over.
KIPLING GOING TO ENGLAND.
His Hasty Departure Is the Subject of
Some Gossip.
BRATTLEBORO, Vt., Aug. 31.âRud
yard Kipling has closed his residence here
and has left town to sail from New York
to England, where he will make his home
for an indefinite period.
The reason given out some time ago for
tv departure was that his relations with
hiiL'iish publishers ri-quire his presence on
that Bide of the water, but the suddenness
wit wiiich tie determined on departure
after his trouble with his brother-in-law
and the subsequent appearance in court
which he was requited to make has led to
the opinion that laniiiy rather that lit
erary matters are attributable for bis
going.

LI HUNG CHANG
AT WEST POINT
Continuous Rain Prevents
a Military Display at
the Post.
SCENES ON THE HUDSON
The Viceroy Lost in Wonder as
He Views the Brooklyn
Bridge.
FAST TRAINS ALSO PLEASE HIM
Asks Scores of Questions and Returns
in Every Way Delighted With
His Trip.
NEW YORE, N. V., Aug. 31.â Li Hung
Chang and leading members of bis suite,
accompanied by a distinguished party of
American friends, sailed at 8:30 o'clock
this morning on the United Statos dis
patch boat Dolphin for West Point. In
anticipation of his departure and despite
the early hour a large crowd had assem
bled in the vicinity of the Waldorf.
The start for the pier was made at 7:35
o'clock. The Viceroy walked to bis car
riage, which he shared with General Eta
ger and Interpreter Lo Fung Lub. I>ur
ing the drive he talked with General Ru
ger, and appeared to be asking many ques
tions. On arriving at the pier Li seated
himself in the sedan chair u:id was car
ried to the barge in waiting.
The boat was manned by a lieutenant
aii<l a crew of eight men. Li seated him
self in the stern, General Rueer and Lo
King Shu, the Viceroy's second son, oc
cupying the next seat. The oarsmen
pulled vigorously and were soon along
side the Dolphin, which lay anchored out
in the stream. When Li reached the top
of the ladder he was received by the com
mander, Captain Clover. The Dolphin's
tyro guns boomed out a salute of nineteen
guns and several private steam yachts in
the vicinity dipped their flags and blews
whistles. The otber visitors came on
board in the Dolphin's steam launch.
The Dolphin hoisted anchor at 8:40,
turned round and steamed pa?t the Bat
tery and up the Hudson toward \\ Â»i-tÂ» i -t
Point. The yellow dragon flag of Cuina
floated from her foremast, the Jack at
her tow and the American flag from her
stern.
The proposed inspection of warship- was
abandoned, the Viceroy ueeming it to be
crowding too much into one day. The
piers on both s dcs of the Mast Rivet were
throncod with persons anxious to get a
view of the Dolphin as she forged her way
toward the Battery. The stream was filled
with steam craft, which kept up a constant
shrieking of whistles. When opposite the
navy-yard the regulation navy sulute was
given.
The Brooklyn bridge and Battery were
lined with people scrambling to get good
vantage points. The Dolphin pointed her
nose up the Hudson River at 9:15. All
along the river front she was saluted by
the ferry-boats and stnamers, and in some
instances vessels were decorated in honor
of the party.
After Li Lad boarded the Dolphin and
warmly greetea the others of the party he
went to the poopdeck, where he sat and
chatted pleasantly the greater part of the
journey up the river. He immediately
began to display an Interest in his sur
roundings, and his inexhaustible supply
of questions began to pour forth.
In passing the naw-yard the Chine=e
fiag was hoisted on the old wooden ship
Vermont, while the saluting party on tiie
cobdeck fired a salute of nineteen euns.
The Viceroy then caught sight of the
Brooklyn bridge. He was in the very best
of spirits and kept up a constant run of
queries with those about him.
The entire party became very much in
terested in Colonel Grant's history of the
bridge, and the Viceroy began to examine
the colonel on some points. He asked if
the bridge belonged to a company or to
the municipalities, and what it had cost to
construct it; had it paid for itself, etc.;
finally he wanted to know if New York
city uonds were at a premium.
After all of these que.^tions had been an
swered to his apparent satisfaction he re
marked that it was a. wonderful Structure,
that the Americans were a very ingenious
race, that their ingenuity seemingly knew
no bounds.
A continuous rain to-day interfered with
a big demonstration in honor of Li Hung
Chang's visit to the military post. As
early as 8 o'clock the crowds began to ar
rive at West Point by boat and train, and
by noontime there were at least 10,000 i>eo
ple upon the ground. The rain, however,
precluded any outside military display)
hence the drills and reception at the su
perintendent's quarters were abandoned.
The Dolphin, with Its distinguished
guests aboard, dropped anchor at West
Point at 12:40, about 200 yards from the
landing. Earl Li declined to go ashore
on account of the rain, but permitted his
youngest son to land.
A hurried trip was made around the
post, and the distinguished guests were
then returned to the Dolphin, which im
mediately weighed anchor and started
back to New York.
There was no incident of note on the re
turn trip, although the Viceroy was inter
ested in the sneed of the New York Cen
tral trains. When the Dolphin anchored
Lf Hung Chang thanked the' officers of the
bo;Â»t through his interpreter for their
courtesies', and as he left the dispatch-boat
anotn*r salute was fired and the Chinese
imperial flag was lowered. He was driven
to his hotel at once.
ST. PAUL IS FILLING UP.
Over Eighty Thousand Strangers in the
City to Participate in the
C. A. R. Encampment.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug. 31.â 1t is esti
mated to-night that there are over 80,000
strangers in the city, and they are still
coming. Streets for several blocks around
the Union Depot are crowded with people
who have not yet been assigned rooms for
the night. The crowd is beyond expecta
tions, and it is estimated that there are
40.000 people to come in on the trains to
morrow. There is great delay on all sides
on account of the crush.
To-night several crack posts of other
cities, notably those of Detroit an<l Chi
catro, gave drills in the .-".reels. At 8:30
this evening Commacder-in-Chief Walker
and Mrs. Walker were given a reception
at the Hotel Ryan, which was attended
by several thousand people.
At the same hour at the State Capitol a
general leceDtion in charge of the Minne
sota Relief Corps was given to the Grand
Army proper This was attended by 20 -
000 people.
The Denver people arrived to-day and
began to canvass the situation with a
view to getting the encampment of 18!<7.

RAILROAD ED TO PRISON.
A Kesprctable hex\<lent of Denver Com
milt*a to a Xeur l'orh Jail.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 31.â An elder
ly, well dressed roan, who described him
self as Alfred Sayres of Denver, Colo.,
was arraigned yesterday in the Lee avenue
Police Court, charged with vagrancy.
SayreÃ was arrested late on Saturday night
near the Grand-street ferry by Special
Policeman Craft. He denied that he was
a vagrant and said that at the time of his
arrest he was looking for the Metropolitan
Hotel, at which he was a guest.
"1 am a lawyer, your Honor," said the
prisoner, 'and to substantiate it, here are
.1 number of letters. I came here from
Denver to visit an uncle in Babylon, Long
I. land, a short time ago and stayed at the
Metropolitan before eoing out on the
isisnd. Yesterday evening, when I re
tu.ned from Babylon, I thought I would
stay at the tame place and was looking
for it when a man approached me and
asked me where i waa going. I told him
that 1 was looking lor the hotel and ha
took me to the police station, where they
locked me up."
No attempt was made on the part of the
court to learn whether or not the prisoner
had been a gnest ot tlie liotel, but he was
committed to jail until to-day despite his
pleadings. At the liutel Charles Allers,
the proprietor, said a man named Sayres
and answering tlie description of the pris
oner had been a guest at the hotel.

CONTRACTORS DEM AND GOLD.
How the Von sibil it ;/ of a Hrynn Adinin-
ittrtilion StriL-'M Them.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 31.âAl
ready the menace of a Bryan adminis
tration is observable in the business tran
sactions of the Government. Attention
has been called in these dispatches to the
bad prospects of any bidding for im
portant river and harbor work this year,
in view of the distrust in the financial
integrity of the Government under the
Bryan party.
A bal was received at the Navy Depart
ment Saturday which shows with v.inti a
free-silver administration is likely to be
confronted by those who will accept its
coirracis. Bids were recently invited by
the Bureau <>l Yards and Docks for a quay
wall at the Mare Island (Cal.) Navy-yard,
the contract bein worth, it was esti
niai (i, about $20,00 '. There were six Did
ders, all of the-I'aeilic Coast.
The lowest bidder was an Oakland man,
and one of the other bidders, a well
known Ban Francisco firm of constructors,
named its price $24,94.{, and specified that
it l>e paid In gold. Those who are familiar
with the methods of contractors who deal
with the Government are confident that
bidders under a free-silver system of pub
lic finance will insist on payment in gold.
Very few business houses, it is pointed
out, can afford to accept contracts at a
shifting basis.

SHARKEY SPARS
WITH SULLIVAN,
Pitiable Spectacle Presented
by the Once Famous
John L.
NOW TOO FAT TO FIGHT
So the Ex-Champion Pleads for
Leniency and Exhibits
Himself.
AN EASY MARK FOR THE SAILOR
Scarcely Any Opinion as to the Lad's
Ability Obtained by the
Perlormance.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 3Lâ At Marti- |
son-square Garden to-nu'ht about 4500
sports took their first opportunity of see
ing Thomas Sharkey of California, the ex
sitilor who claims to ha7e bested and j
nearly knocked out James J. Corbett at I
S;tn Francisco. The aspirant for cham
pionship honors sparred four exhibition
rounds with the old Napoleon of the prize- I
ring, JohnL. Sullivan. Of course scarcely 1
any opinion of Sharkey's merits or de- !
merits couid be obtained, as John L. was j
so fat and unwieldy that he was in his j
own wa>.
The Californian is undoubtedly a power
ful man and very fast, but beyond that he
had no opportunity of showing what he
could do. The crowd was perfectly satis
fied to see the man who is matched to
meet Corbett to a finish next December,
and did not expect to see a fight. Peter
Maher and Fitzsimmons occupied seats in
ttie house, and after the bell rang for the
fir^t round Fitzsimmons came down to
the ringside and sized Sharkey up. It was
10:15 o'clock when Sullivan and Sharkey
were coming down from the dressing
room. The big fellow almost hid the ex
sailor who followed behind, robed in a
gray baih robe.
Sullivan was greeted with a terrific
round of applause as usual. He was hog
fat, his abdomeri hanging in a fold over
the waistband of his trunks. Sharkey
was a decided contrast when he threw off
his bath robe and stood attired in bright
green trunks with a belt of the National
colors.
At 10:20 o'clock Charley Harvey intro
duced the men. John L. was again
greeted with a salvo of cheers, while
Sharkey was more moderately, applauded.
The crowd insisted on a speech, and
John, whose voice has grown quite husky,
said : "1 am come here to spar exhibition
only. I have had my day, and tnia young
man is ambitious and trying to reach the
1 top of the ladder. I am only going to
spar friendly. I am almost too fat. I
hope you won't say any harsh things."
Then the gong sounded for the tliree
miniite rounds and Sharkey danced all
around the big fellow, whose attempts at
agility were pathetic. Occasionally dur
ing the bout Sullivan let out with a faint
trace of his former self. But Sharkey
could have landed at will and made little
or no attempt at defense. Sam Austin
was referee, but of course none was
needed. The police were not called upon
to interfere. Four bouts between local
boxers preceded the main event.

AWFUL WRECK AVERTED.
The Engine of a Tourist Train
Rushes Down From Pikes
Peak.
Engineer and Fireman Jump for Their
Lives and the Passengers Escape
Miraculously.
COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo., Aug.
31. â What might have been one of the
most disastrous railway wrecks of the year
was narrowly averted on the famous Pikes
Peak cog road, just two mi.'es above Mani
tou, Sunday alternoon. The engine with a
car completely filled with passenuers left
the summit of Pikes Peak shortly after 12
o'clock.
Everything went well until one of the
stet'ves-t grades of the road above the
Manitou cog station was reached, when
one of the connecting rods of the engine
broke and twisted out a cy!inder-head.
Control of the ponderous piece of ma
chinery was lost ini mediately and it
started down the steep grade with a fright
ful momentum. The engineer and fire
man jumped lor their lives and escaped
with only a severe shaking up.'
The runaway engine remained on the
rails for the distance of nearly a mile,
when just above Shady Bpringa it jumped
the track and collided with a gigantic rock
which it split in twain. The rebound sent
the engine into a ravine 100 feet below.
The engine preceded the passenger coach,
but was not attached to it. When the
danger became apparent the s-ignal was
given for the coach brakes and the car was
stopped before it also got beyond control,
thus probably saving the lives of scores of
tourists.
In the car was a party of distinguished
railway people, including General Manager
Frederick Howard of the London and
Northwestern railroad and General Super
intendent Turnbull of the same road.

TRAPPER FANCHER'S STORY.
Contradicts the Prosecution's Evidence
R garding the Prisoner's
Horse.
WEAVER VILLK, Cal., Aug. 31.â
Round Valley is turning out in force to
save Joe Gregory from death by the noose.
In point of numbers the witnesses for the
defense have the best of it, but much of
their testimony is conflicting, and when
cross-questions extend beyond the range
of former rehearsal there are frequent
contradictions. Round Valley, though, ia
loyal to Gregory, and few of its denizens
fail to recall some circumstance that will
help to prove Gregory guiltless of the mur
der of "Jack"' Lmleneld.
Somewhat of a surprise was sprung upon
the spectators shortly after court opened
this morning, when G. B. Fancher, a gen
tleman of nomadic instincts, was called to
be sworn. As he sat down in the chair,
adjusted his glasses, leaned forward on a
broom handle, which served as a staff, and
began to talk, it was apparent that the
witness' character was as unique as his
appearance.
He stated that he was a hunter and
trapper by occupation, and that he had
resided in California since 1849, and he
could not name one locality where he had
resided in for a period of three months at
a stretch during that time. His present
home was township 13 west. He had
leased the township, which was but hulf
surveyed, from William Thompson as a
grazing range for cattle, in case he should
see fit to accumulate some and place them
upon it. He had some hogs when he left
home, but was not certain that they would
be there when he returned. He had
started his sons in business by presenting
to each of them a sow. A cabin had been
built upon his range, but he did not re
member in what year, as he was not feel
ing very well at the time and took no
notice.
Fancher stated that on the 27th of Sep
tf-mber, while fishing on the north fork of
Eel River, he had seen Joe Gregory and
Fred Radchffe cross at the Wilburn or
lower crossing at sundown, going toward
the Vinton cabin. At the time he was dis
tant from them about fifty yards. There
was a considerable stream of water then
and as Gregory stopped to let his horse
drink, wilh the horse's head pointing
down the stream, he noticed that the
horse was bald faced. He had met no
other persons on the river that afternoon,
thougn he had been in the locality for two
hours. He stated that he had" caught
some fish and cleaned them after dark,
utilizing his sense of feeling in lieu of
light after he got to camp.
Should bis testimony prove true this
witness would be a powerful aid for the
defense, and for this reason a larger por
tion of the day was consumed in cross
questioning him, and it was apparent dur
ing the afternoon session that be was be
coming entangled in the traps set by the
prosecution. At the beginning of his
examination the witness had complained
of being somewhat hard of hearing, until
he chanced to mention that he had heard
Radcliffe and Gregory in conversation
atter they had crossed the river, when
Radciiffe had remarked to Gregory: "Mr.
Gregory, we will go over to Louisey Creek
to-morrow and look tor some cattle."
Upon being reminded of hi.s infirmity by
Deputy Attorney-General Post, the "wit
ness explained that after he had become
acquaint d with the sound of a strange
voice it was no difficulty for him to under
stand, even when spoken in a low tone.
\\ esterman, George Cummingsand Tom
Henley were ajrain called to testify in re
tard to distances measured by them.
"Jack" Weldon of Ukiah was questioned
in regard to a conversation between Peter
ONeil and Peter O'Farrell, and confirmed
none of the latter's statements. Tom
Haydou, at whose house the plot of assas
sination is supposed to have been laid,
and who is charged with complicity in the
crime, stated that he had never heard of
or entered into any plot to kill 'Jack"
Littlefaeld. He had been at home at sun
down on the evening of September 27,
1895. Buck Lacock, Bayiiss Van Horn,
Fred Radcliffe, Joe Gregory, Frank Han
over, Fleetwood and Dr. Joyer had been
at his house that day. Lacock had gone
after Fred Radciiffe and Gregory. Rad
cliffe came unarmed, but went away with,
Vinton's rifle, and the party of six â the
witness, Radcliffe, Gregor}-, Lacock, Van
Horn and Crow â went upon to the hill.
Oregon Sanders, attorney for the de
fense, at this point asked for a recess, as
he was indisposed.

Over Fifty Men, Women and Children
Narrowly Escape an Awful
Holocaust.
POIÂ»LAND, Ore., Aug. 31.â A thrilling
tale is that of the escape of 8. Benson, his
wife and three children, and the four men
' employed in his logging camp, from the
fierce forest fire of Friday last, which
raged between Oak Point and Ka."!e Cliff,
on the Columbia River. Benson's main
camp consists of quite a village, there
being fourteen cabins ana a store in the
clearing. In the center of the little town,
and in front of the store, is a well, fitted
with a powerful pump, while on the edge
of the clearing to the east is a live epring. j
When the fire was seen approaching,
I'.enson gathered his men at the camp and
proceeded to pump water into all the I
impty barrels to be procured, some sixty i
in number. Tnese were ranged about the j
cabins, and the work of thoroughly wet
ting the roofs and logs commenced.
The clearing consists of about ten acreÂ»,
and neverdoubting for a moment that the j
water supply from the well and spring i
would hold out the loggers proposed stay
ing with their camp and saving it from
the flames, which were galloping through \
the forest toward them. A bucket brigade
was formed, and as fast as the water in a j
barrel was emptied against a cabin it was !
immediately refilled, those handling the j
Water going to the next full barrel in the
meantime. In this way some 200 barrels |
ot water had been pumped from the well, j
The lire had "jumped" the camp, and
was reaching down toward the logging
railroad and Eagle Cliff trail. Already
the Oak Point trail to the river bank was
a seething mass of flames, and now the
Eagle Cliff trail was on hre, but with the
well pumping Its powerful stream ol water
the camp could be saved. The lire waÂ»
growing about the edges of the spring, j
cutting off that supply. Stiil there wad
no fear so long as the well held out.
Suddenly there came a shout from the i
"men at the well, "The Dump is suckine I" !
Benson, who was at the rear of th â 
store building, passing water, ran
clown to the pump. It was true. The
well had run dry. "Make for the railroad,
men; drop everything; let the camp go,"
he cried, as he rushed back to the store
to get his wife, baby and daughters Alice I
and Carrie. There was no second bidding I
needed. The flames were eating up
toward the first trestle, the burning of
whicb meant the cutting off of all escape
and a fearful death in a blazing forest.
Gathering his family about him, the
awful run for the first half-mile, wuere the
lire had traversed the Eagle Cliff trail, was
commenced. Everything was left behind, j
The women folk, owing to the intense
h^at of the previous twtnty-four hours,
kid donned light calico wrappers, and it
wis with these they arrived in Portland.
Down the fiery gauntlet of the trail,
through the blinding, suffocating smoke,
the logger, with hi* family and men,
Etarted. So long as human beings had
stayed within the clearing the camp cat
tle, although restive, had also stayed.
Now, with the flight of their protectors,
the poor animals went wild with fright, '
and bellowing dashei down the trail with j
the fleeing people, on through the fierce j
heat, surrounded on each side by racking :
boughs and crushing timber, until at last !
the trestle was reached. Once across this
there was saiety. Already the underbrush
about the underpinning was ablaze. They
came just in the nick of time. Five min
utes lost and the entire party of fifty-two
ruen, women and children would have met
death in an awful holocaust.
Benson piloted his party across safely; '
not so, however, the dumb brutes that had
followed. To them the trestle, with its
open ties, was an impassable barrier. The
cattle tried to make the crossing, only
after a step or two to flounder and fall.
Reaching safety on the other side of the
ravine, the fugitives of the fire turned to I
lootc back. The sight was horrifying, j
â¢ There were the cattle surrounded by flame
and smoke. Eacn minute or so the low- I
hanging pall of smoke would lift and !
they could see an animal reel and fall into i
the abyss of fire beneath. Out on the ties- j
tie were three oxen which had, tie by tie, j
worked their way beyond the death range i
of the fire and, half suffocated, could pro- !
ceed no further. Their efforts but brought !
them death in another form, for as Ben- !
son and his party turned to resume their i
flight down the track the burning trest le I
fell with a crash, currying with it into the
ravine below th<Â» suffering brutes.

LOS ANGELES SHOOTING.

Bullet Fired Through a
Partition.
A Seeming Accident Which Is Be
lieved to Have Been an Attempt
to Murder.
Loe Angeles Offick of The Call )
32s Pouth Broadway, V
Los Anoeles, Cal., Aug. 31. )
L. Rosenberg's pawnshop at 118 East
Fir-t street was the scene this afternoon of
what appears to have been a very peculiar
accident, or what is more probable a delib
erate attempt at assassination where a
great deal of method and clever markman
ship were employed.
A stranger in the garb of a rancher en
tered the store at 5 o'clock and inquired
for a revolver, with a view of purchasing.
Ho was shown a 38-caliber Colt's which he
seemed to admire, and asked permission
to try the fit of a few loose cartridges
which he had in his vest pocket. When
given permission the stranger inserted two
or three, and while attempting to manipu
late the weapon it was discharged. Tne
piece was leveled at a board partition a
few feet away and on a line with the back
of Leonard Feliz's neck in an adjoining
room. Feliz was struck by the ball, it
passing out just below his chin, missing
the jugular by a hair's breadth.
The wounded man was engaged in a
poker game, and it is surmised that the
stranger had been fleeced by Feliz and his
associate and took this plan to get even.
The ballon its way to the gamester's neck
is said to have cutoff a finger belonging
to the shabbily dressed stranger, who,
leaving the revolver behind, quit the shop
and has not been seen since. Feliz, who
is known among iiis associates as "Chile
Con Came," will recover.
FLED OWN HER BABES.
Arrest of a Demented Woman at the In-

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 31.â A sad
story is involved in the arrest to-day at El
Monte, in this county, of the mother of
infant twins, who in a fit of mental aber
ration imagined that her babes and her
â¢eu were in danger of starvation at their
home on Boyle Heights. The distracted
woman is the wife of A. E. Nelligan. Her
story is that .-he felt compelled to quit her
home owini; to harsh treatment, and that
bur object in (earing was to reach a place
of safety and security in the home of her
mother at Cucaniotina.
A Deputy Sheriff returned with the trio
this afternoon, and when the mother vai
cued to appear before Judge Clark to
show cause why she should not be re
lieved of tiie care of her baoies. she re
lused to do so, and the twins were turned
over to their father, who had instituted
habeas corpus proceedings to recover
them. After the proceedings had been
entered on the record the mother went to
the courtroom, and when informed of the
action of the court seemed perfectly satis
fied with the outcome of the case. The
husband alleges that he has, for some
time, seen evidences of a wavering mind
in his wife, and when she left home with
her babes without warning he feared she
might inflict bodily harm to them.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 31.â The San
Jose Turners' shooting section "com
mers" in Turner Hall on First street last !
night kept up until about midnight, and j
Prominent Riflemen at the Turners* Shooting Tournament
at San Jose.
but few of the marksmen left the hall ]
until Master of Ceremonies Zeiler bade
them "Gute nacht." Notwithstanding
: they were all tired from the preceding i
i day's picnic and shooting and the even- j
| ing's pleasure, the riflemen were out at
; the range brignt and early to-day, for all
wanted to secure the red flag for first
bullseye.
Several new faces were noticed in the
shooting stand. F. P. Schuster and D. B.
! Faktor arrived on the early train from
| San Francisco. \Y. Cameron, Dr. Edward
Vlrich, Lj. H. Knoche and other local
marksmen put in an appearance with
their rifles. Mr. Cameron caused a little
astonishment by shooting on the point
target with a heavy Winchester magazine
rifle, but he reached the black without
much trouble.
Kudolph tScherf introduced a novelty in
the rifl hue in the Â«hape of a No. 3 Win
chester barrel on nn old-fashioned Aus.
trian *tock and a Mauser action. In this
he shot the new Ideal 32-25 cartridge,
straight shell. For such light ammuni
tion the bullet holds up well, and Mr.
Rcherf did credit to himself anl his non
descript rifle.
At 10 a. m. sharp the targets ran tip, and
their appearance called lorth a shower o f
lead f n m the six stands. About two
rounds were fired before trie cry of "First
DUllseye" was raised. It was Captain
Fred lucky shot which gave
r him as 25U prize. From that time until
noon the red, wnite and blue flags were
kept on the fly on the point targets.
On the honorary tareets t c wheels were
kept on the spin recording the shots made.
Faktor started out on the honorary with
65 rings, which he increased to 70, on
24 ~ 22â 24, tyint; John Utachig's score
made the day before. During the entire
day there was a hot competition tor high
est score, for the rir*t prize was a beautiful
and valuable table set of silTex kniras,
forks and spoons presented by Hr.n.
Charles M. Shortridite, who is amembtr
of the Turners. Dr. Bangs was determined
to secure the trophy, lor he shot ticket
after ticket to beat 70. At last success
crownt-d bis efforts, for he reached 72 on !
-'4â 25â 23 rings. This was for the :me .
setback to the others, as 72 was a hard
â core to beat.
"Grandpa" William Ehrenpfort shot
under great dirhe-.ilties fora time in tne '
forenoon. His biniets flew right and left, I
to hi* dismay. He could not account lor
the wild sho.s until a.ter two point tickÂ«tn
were spoiled. Tuen he discovered that hi* .
front sight-base u;i* loose in tne barrel- j
Blot and had moved with every shot.
A little before 12 o'ciocK the riflemen
began to warm Dp for the last bullseye I
before noon. The contest lay between Dr. *
Bangs and .-chuster. but the latter polled '
in ah< ad just before the targets closed. !
Captaina ptain Schumacher invited his guests to j
the pavilion, where a fine cold lunch had
been spread by Mrs. Schumacher and the
ladies of the Bchuetzen section. After
justice had been done to the spread tnere
was a rush for the first bullseye in the j
afternoon, which was won by Dr. Banns. |
During the middle of the afternoon tho I
shooting almost ceased owing to the bad
light on the targets, but wuen this annoy
ance passed the marksmen went to work
again with renewed vigor.
Philo Jacoby stated, during the en
forced intermission, th't when the shoot
ing section held its next medal contest he
would have ready the gold medal that ho
promised. Two years ago he offered such
a trophy to the best shot among the active
members of the cluo, which was won by
Captain Schumacher. The same condi
tions hold for the iiext medal contest,
i The last honors of the day fell to Wil
liam Elirenpfort, the veteran rifleman of
the coast. He is now past 70 years old,
but shoots with the champion class. All
were making their best efl its for the last
bullseye of the day when Ohrenpfort was
in the stand on an honor iry ticket. He
had 23â22, nnd his laÂ»t shot was 24, a
bullseye, which .made his score 69. The
aged marksman was picked up and car
ried on the shoulders of his friends, who
cheered him roundly. The last shot let him
in for a cuance tor the fourth prize on a
tie wit!) Strecker, who made 09 yesterday.
As the two could not divide the prize they
shook dice and again tied on 20. A second
shake threw the prize to Sirecker, but it
did not deprive the old sharpshooter of the
honors he had won. And thus this pleas
ant shooting festival closed with the laurel
wreath on the aged marksman's brow.
After the shooting was over Philo
jÃcoby, H. Otter, J. G. McMillan, L.
Weber and Robert Langer returned to
town to measure thu point target bullseyes

IDAHO'S FIVE
STATE TICKETS,
Silver Forces Unable to
Adopt a Plan of
Fusion.
DEFEAT FOR DUBOIS.
The Republican Bolter Finds All
Party Doors Closed Upon
Him.
WHITE METAL MEN AT SEA.
Their Dissensions Are Certain to Give
the Electoral Ticket to
McKinley.
POCATELLO, Idaho, Aug. 31.â The
political situation is the one topic to
night, and is an extremely complicated
situation. Senator Dubois, Congressman
Wilson, Democratic National Commitlee
rnan Johnson of Washington, D. C, and
the advisory board of the Democratic
Central Committee of Idaho, composed
of J.imes H. Hawley and Timothy Regan
of Ada County and Jacob Horn of Canyon
County, arrived this morning, and caused
a meeting of the local Democratic leaders
to be called at the opera-house this after
noon. This meeting was private, but it is
learned that the object was to urgÂ«Â» a unity
of the silver forces of all parties and to
place a silver ticket in the field. About a
dozen prominent Democrats, in addition
to the central committeemen, were
present. Being pledged by the action of
the State Convention at Boise City to sup
port their nominees they were powerless.
The meeting was adjourned to receive
some information from National tiend
quartern. and failing in this Senator Du
bois and his party were informed that
they would be turned over to the Populist
Central Committee to see what conces
sions would be granted by that body, and
it is understood that, if possible, a meet
ing will be arranged.
No attempt was made on the part of the
silver leaders at the Boise convention to
secure fusion with the Populibts and Dem
ocrats, and when Senator Dubois prom
ised to control the silver Republicans ot
Idaho in the interests of the Democratic
party, in exchange for the silver Demo
crats' support, he undertook more than he
could accomplish. There has been *o
much contention that it is certain it is too
late to harmonize the different parties on
a silver ticket, and if so there will un
dcvbtfdly be five tickets to choose from,
with Republican success certain.

noted equal suffragists arrived at head

tee, when it was decided by a large ma
jority that the work of this county should
continue as heretofore â co-operative, but
not auxiliary.

ANCHORED HI SEATTLE.
Arrival of the First Vessel of
the New Japanese Mail
Steamship Line.
Car.noa B^om and Bells Are Rung
When the Miike Maru Steams
Into the Harbor.
SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 31. â Amid
blowing of steam whistles, ringing of
bells and firing of cannon, the Miike
Maru, the maiden vessel of Nipon Yusen
Kabuchiki (Japanese Mail Steamship
Company), which has entered upon a ten
year contract to operate a steamship line
in connection with the Great Northern
Railroad between Japan and the United
States, Seattle being tho American ter
minus, steamed into Seattle harbor tins
afternoon, and at 3 o'clock was made fast
to Scthwabiichcrs dock. It was an evenâ
the beginning of an epoch â so declared
the commercial life of Seattle; and uole?s
than la.OOO people lined the wham
docks in attestation of their appreciation,
and to bid joyous welcome to Miike Maru,
her master, Captain Christopher Young,
and officers.
At 1 o'clock the firoboat Snoqnalniie,
with the Chamber of Commerce reception
committee and ai/out, 2i.D ieu<iii)K citizens
aboard, steamed down Uie bay and greeted
the Maru at the entrance of the harbor off
Magnolia Bluff, the site of the new army
post and fortitication. Small craft of all
kinds and description joined in a triumph
ant water parade back to the city. The
day was not an ideal one, for smoke and
fog dimmed the horizon, but this did not
dampen the ardor of those participating
in the welcome. Durinc a salute of twen
ty-one guns, which was fired by the Miike
Maru in fitting acknowledgment of the
compliment, innumerable Japanese rock
ets were shot skyward, producing a most
beautiful effect.
From the ship the officers, led by James
Griffiths, general agent of the company,
were escorted to a platform on the wharf,
from which formal addresses of welcome
were delivered by Hon. E. C. Hughes,
who spoke for the Stale and Governor Mo-
Graw, the latter being unable to attend;
President Graves of the Chamber of Com
merce and Mayor Wood. Appropriate
responses were made by Miki Saito, Jap
anese Consul; Mr. Griffiths and Captain
Young. Consul Saito closed his weil
cho-en remarks saying:
-This, I imagine' is the very first occa
sion on which a Japanese vessel broke tl>e
foam of the Pacific to find its way to a
welcome in the smiling waters of Pu<*et
Sound."
Tho Miike Maru sailed from Yokohama
on August 5, via Honolulu, leaving the
latter port on August 21. It brought a
fair cargo, and there is more freight piled
upon the wharf than she will be able to

SAN JOSE NORMAL CHANGE.
Miss Mackinnon, Preceptress of the State

Was Reduced.
h^VÂ° 1S"1 S " AU *- 31 - Ml^ Eliza
beth Mackinnon. who has been precep

past four years, has resigned. She will be
succeeded by Miss M. E. Blasdel of Oak
land who for a year has been secretary of
the Board of Trustees and assistant libra
rian.

Sontig's Captor Unrewarded.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 31.â "Jim"
Witty will have to satisfy himself with the
empty glory of having captured Soutag,
the late partner of Chris Evans, for it was
decided to-day that Witty was not entitled
to any part of the $10,000 reward given by
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company.
Witty recently brought suit against the
company in the United States Circuit
Court to compel it to pay him the $10,000
reward. The court decided Witty caught
Sontag only after some one else had shot
him, and was, therefore, not entitled to
the money.

Men! husbands, brothers, fathers I Why
do you let them suffer ?
You do not appreciate the extent of the
suffering. It is of such a nature as not to
alarm you. Pains in the back, weakness,
headaches, nervousness, hysteria, nervous
prostrationâ "oh, well, most women have
ont- or the other â can't be helped I They
get over it in time I"
Otic upon you! You think nothing of
years of snff,erine of those you pretend to
love! LV-r'U
But worseâ they DON'T get over it more
than half the time. Chronic inflamma-
tion and catarrh of the womb, leucorrhea,
etc., with their train of miserable attend-
ants, lead at least half their victims slowly
but straight to an early grave.

CASE AND ILEINOR SCORED.
An Eloquent P:ea for Religious Toler
ationâLocal Application of
the Test.
Father Yorke spoke to even a larger
Â° audience last night at Metropolitan Hall
than that which greeted him last week in
the same auditorium. Every seat was
tilled and advantageous standing room
Â» was a scarcity.' His subject was "The
Little Red School," and incidentally he
â  "took occasion to reply to a lecture deliv
ered a week ago Sunday by Rev. Mr.
, - "Fleenor of Seattle and to pay attention 10
I â¢other A. P. A. speakers. It was the sec
.. pnd of the series of live lectures that the
Â°, "champion of Catholicism has undertaken
" 'Â« to deliver under the auspices of the Ameri
> can Women's Liberal League.
Dr. C. I). Cleveland, a cousin of Presi
dent Grover Cleveland, on behalf of the
league introduced Rev. Dr. Jacob Nieto as
the chairman of the evening. The hand
.pome rabbi's appearance was greeted with
hearty applause, as had been his entrance
o upon the platform, side by side with the
"champion of the local Catholics. The
Blatform was rilled with the local mem
bers of the Catholic priesthood, and a
number of prominent members of the
Protestant faith. Among the latter were
oÃev. Mr. Shaw and Rev. Mr. Moreland.
Dr. Cleveland, in his brief introduction
of Rabbi Nieto, remarked that the latter
"appeared "in the interest of American
toleration and liberty."
*â¢ 'It affords me no small amount of grati
fication," began Rabbi Nieto, "both as
ran individual- and as a representative of
an important section of the Jewish com
"munity to be here with you this evening,
'â¢ to express my condemnation of religious
persecution in any form and all methods
'â¢ employed for its furtherance.
..erf can be no two opinions," he con
â¢. tiaued, "on this point and there should be
J no sort of hesitation in expressing only
. (he oire opinion that can remain in the
mind of man.
'â¢Religious persecution is inconsistent
â witn modern civilization and ruins both
the best interest* of the city and the
country wherein it is permitted.
"Children of. one household, members
of one family, citizens of one State,
brothers at large, instead of working hand
in hand for the welfare of the State, fam
ily and household are made to fly it one
another's throat in the most hideouÃ
cau-e that ever caused man to spill blood.
"A-< a man, as a Jew, I demand religious
liberty and toleration. As a citizen of
this magnificent and august Republic I
â¢ insist that every man be allowed to wor
ship his God as he will.
'The question may be asked of us:
Why. as Jews, do we stand shoulder to
Bhou!der with the Roman Catholic at this
time? We would stand shoulder to shoul
der with any sect that was experiencing
any difficulty in practicing its religious
â  creed in its own way and according to its
â own light.
â¢â¢I will tel! you why the Jew stands by
Â°Â° the Roman Catholic; I will tell you why':
0 Not only from tee pure dictates of his
heart, which will always detest religious
" -persecution. The Jew, I hope, is beyond
.a '- all other things, gratelul."
'â '." He related how in the early portion of
the sixteenth century, when the princes
â¢ "x>i Europe were seeking to despoil and de
. Btroy the Jew, every occupant of the Papal
jjrl cuair had declared "that no Jew should be
persecuted and that his property should |
be- protected. He tolti bow Gregory X
defended the Jew and vouched for the un
truthfulness of the cnarge that the Jews
oÂ° dwint human blood and ate the heart
of a child at the celebration of the Pass
' over feast; how Archbishop Werner of
.. Mayence defended the Jews from the
o. charge of child murder, when no one else
â  : dared raise hand or voice in their behalf;
, . how Innocent IV secured for the Jew the
â¢ â¢privilege of being allowed to retain his
* Bible and Talmud when all the nations
were against him; now Innocent VII
gave a refuge to the Jews when they were
expelled from Spain; how Pius IV re
moved the badge which up to his time all
â¢Jews, as related of Shylock by Shakes
peare, were compelled to wear to indicate
that they were Jews, and how Henry I,
Archbishop of Mayence. and Clement VI
had given protection to the Jews. Con
tinuing he said:
"In view of all these kindnesses show
ered upon our race by the supreme power
of the Catholic church, how can we do
otherwise than stand in and say that there
shall be no religious test in this country."
He referred to the anti-Semitic agitation
in Germany, and remarked: "Those who
o were resi onsible for that were not Catho
lics." After a tribute to the broad spirit
01 deration that he said marked the
treatment of other sects by tne Catholics
he introduced Father Yorke.
The latter announced that on Thursday
evening, in Metropolitan Hail, he would
deliver a lecture for the benefit of the Pre
sentation Convent schools, and begged the
support oi his auditors for the worthy ob
jects of them institutions. His lecture on
that evening will be on the subject,
"Where did you ge: the Bibie?*' He spoke
in substance as follows:
"Before I begin with that interesting object
known as he little red scboolhouse I have one
or iÂ»o prelaae*, One of tliee dealt with the
gentleman who emigrated from Oakland, even
unio Beat tie; and from at tie to n.iÂ» <'i y, tne
Kcv. Mr. Fit en or. [Hisses and laughter.]
And i.at I have to hay concerning l;im is
bin a continuation of the line of thought put
into such beautiful words by the reverend doc
tor utio has Just spoken oefore me in the re
ci anting to you the feelings that stir hi:- heart
and that stirs the heaii <>, every true Hebrew
concerning religious toleration. mid with what
was .said lrom this platform yesterday aft.r
n:>on, v.hen the Rev. Dr. â¢ Flee lor declared,
"that net a wonderful fusion of the Romans
and Jews last Monday night." It carries one
back to the time when tnc Jews and Romans
united to crucify the Savior." [Murmurs of
mingled awe an.i disapproval.]
That is the spirit of the A. P. A.
Two years Â»cÂ« vie man ho began it In this
City declared: The Ouhoiic to-day, the Jews
I â¢morrow. He denied that lie ever said it.
But yesterday the truth came out, and what
Henry said in one way Fleenor said in an
other.
Has it come to this in this American Repub
lic, that we are to look back to the crimes Â«nd
Bins of 1900 years ago and flash them in the
"face of the *pe< pie to-day and demand thai
they be punished therefor?
Has It come to this that the Jew of to-dny
rills' (j.- punished for what was done 1900
, years neo? Is this Christianity? Surely this
Is not Protestantism! Bctpeetaole Protestant*
1 who love their religion. ho love their church,
remember that when the Christ was crucified
prayed, "Father, forgive them, they know not
what tl < â -â  do."
_ And<sc> we Catholics are proud to stand on
<jhe same platform as the Jews in this good
cause of religion and toleration. [Applause.]
As Dr. KieW* -aid, our standing together on
this platform does not mean tli.it we agree In
our religious opinions. It would bu a small
matter for us to stand together if we did agree
in our religious belief; but the American prin
ciple is thisâ that men, thouvh they may differ
in what they believe, yet when i: comes down
to the good of the community and of the body
politic, when it comes down to this great prin
ciple of religious tolerance, stand together as
one man. [Appiause.]
The trouble of religious intolerance Is that
it grows on that on which it feeds. You may
begin to pen cute a small and an insignificant
sect, but by the force of logic you ate bound to
push your persecution lurther. You may
begin to persecute Hie Catholics to-day; you
will surely have the Jews to-morrow, and the
day alter to-morrow you will have every
Protestant sect that does not agree with you
placed under the ban of this organization,
which is the open sore upon our body politic.
And not only Catholics and Jews, but the
Protestant ho has a Catholic wife, (he Pro
testant who sends his children to whatsoever
school he pleas, the Protestant who has a
Catholic friend, aye, and the Protestant who
will not put his neck under the foot of the
paramour of a bad woman and do in politics
what that scoundrel dictates. [Loud applause.]
Whether it was the effect of the early rain or
not [laughter], 1 remark that the Rev. \V. \V.
Case has come out from his retirement. Last
Sunday evening he paid his respects to your
humble servant and lifter declaring that those
other learned controversialists have not left
me a leg to stand upon, be proceeded to try
his own hand at throwing me down. â¢
However, th speaker subsequently con
cluded, Mr. Case was scarcely worth wast
ing their valuable time upon. He humor
ously reminded his auditors of a rather
mysteriously worded advertisement, which
at one time appeared in some of the street
cars and whicn began: "Don't be woozy."
[Laughter.] "Chew somebody's gum." If
they could only induce the Rev. Dr. Case
to chew some kind of gum and if that
gum would only stick his teeth together
for the rest of bis natural life, heâ Fattier
Yorkeâ believed that Dr. Case's own co
religionists would be heartily glad of it.
Father Yorke accused Dr. Case of a dis
honest attempt to foist upon the public
credulity a quotation from a spurious
French translation of Gury's Compen
dium, in which quotation it was asked:
Are Roman Catholic priests subject to the
civil law? Dr. Case gave a negative answer.
He (Father Yorke) finally left a copy of
I (Jury at The Call office, in order to show
j the public of San Francisco that after the
I question was put â "Are clerks or clergy
men bound by the civil law?" â the an
swer was not No, but, in plain terms, Yes.
[Applause. [
He declared last Sunday evening that he had
a document which proves me to be a liar. I
will not return him the word; he may keep it
and use it as often as: he pleases, but I say here
again that the quotation he gives from Gury is
a forger; from top to bottom. And I say to
the good people of the Methodist Episcopal
I church upon whom he is forced for their sins
[laughter], that they are sitting at the feet of a
man who knows not what the truth Is when it
comes to dealing with Catholicity.
I tell â and the responsibility rests upon
their headsâ that they are supporting a man
who hns been shown in the public prints of
this City to have, in questions of fact, stated
the thing which was not and to have made
quotations and given excerpts which never
appeared in the Looks to which he referred
them. I think I can safely leave the Rev. W.
W. Case â¢<> the people of this City, and 1 will
further add that if the Protestant religion has
n-.'ed of such defenders then it is a sad day for
the Protestant churches of San Francisco and
California. [Applause.]
Father Yorke in his third prelude ar
raigned the Rev. Mr. Fieenor once more,
quoting in this connection several extracts
from that gentleman's last public utter
ance, bearing more particularly upon J.
jH. Barry's denunciation of me Rev.
Benjamin Hudelson. This Mr. Fleenor
had characterized as a lie of Rome and
the devil. If so, asked the speaker, why
was not Barry of the Star in jail? [Loud
applause.] The charges had been made
not in genera, terms, but with names, and
unfortunately for the Rev. Benjamin
Hudelson they had been given with date,
and the truth of tne matter was thai R' v.
J Mr. Hudelson was a man who had stepped
I from the trough of sensuality into a Chris
tian pulpit and who stil l recked with tne
' vile smell of the slums.
The charges against Hudelson are no libel;
the charges are mat this man, who hall a dozen
years ago, when he had arrived at the full age
of manhood, had fallen as low as it is pos-ibie
for human nature to fall. The Charges are
that in two or three months he stepped from
this state of degradation into a Christian pul
pit; that he is now at the nead of a society
| which accuses the foreign population oi
; this country with being criiun.a'.s, which
declares that a large section of
this community are unfit to have office;
that they and he have come to save this coun
try and protect our institutions. Barely won
derful saviors. Wonderful protectors are the
Rev. Benjamin Hudel'on, the Hon. Mr. Qnii
zow and all his Kind. [Applause.] Ii the }: v.
Mr. Fleenor remains In the City for a few
months, thereby breaking his record of con
tinuous residence in any city in which he has
hitherto beenâ he may hear something more
about the Hon. and Rev. benjamin Hudelsoii,
and hear it in the courts of this State. [Ap
plause.]
The speaker then proceeded to deal with
the true subject-matter of his address â
the little red scboolhouse, or the public
school system of these States, which he
traced from the earliest times down to the
present day. He pointed out that the
modern non-sectarian system was not in
troduced by the Pilgrim hers, as some
people would lead the public to suppose,
; but was the slow outgrowth of intellectual
i development. He voiced ti e gratitude of
j the Roman Catholic community toward
j Archbishop John Hughes of New York,
| who was primarily responsible for the abo
lition of religious teaching in the schools
of that State.
He outlined his reasons for opposing the
j introduction of the Bible into the public
school, and emphasized tlie fact that the
Roman Catholics rather than risk the
true freedom of education, had pone to
the additional expense of providing
schools of their own, wherein the tenets
of their religion could be installed into
the mind of their children. In Ban Fran
cisco aione 10,000 Catholic children at
tended these schools, at a veariy expense
of $300,000. He remarked upon the in
justice of the sentiment which dictated a
popular outcry about "Rome's- red hand"
whenever a Catholic sought election as a
school superintendent, while the Pro
testant clergyman, on the other hand, in
variably showed himself appreciative oi
ihe spoils of office.
He referre.l in strong language of con
demnation to G. vernor Btidd, whom he
accused of reversing for political motives
the action of the School Board of San
Jose by reintroducin^ the practice of Bible
reading, and further of appointing as
trustee of the Normal School of ban Jose
Henry French, a member of the A. P. A.
He particularly referred to the episode
in Which Trustee Henderson of this City
recently figured when Council 1 of the
A. P. A. placed him upon his trial
because he had dared to vot- lor a Catho
lic as principal or vice-principal of one of
our public schools.
In conclusion he put in an eloquent plea
for the privilege of the parent to teach bis
child as he saw fit. "This," he said, "is
not a country of systems, because we do
not want systems; we want men."
We want men ol honesty, of honor, of In
tegrity. Such men will not be obtained merely
by putting SUCh ami such a law on the statute
book. We can get them only when the citi
zens are raided up to be leal and true and law
abiding, and when they obey the laws not be
cau-e tin are made in sucu a way and by such
a board, but because they believe it is tlielr
duty to do what is right, and Â».s American citi
zens they are going to do their duty. [Loud
applause.]
Alter the chairman had announced that
Father Yorke would deliver a lecture en
titled "The Carpenter's on," in the same
place on September 14, under the auspices
of the American Women's Liberal League

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, IS9G.
Scene From the Drama, "Madame Sans Gene," Presented for .the First Time in This Gty at the
Baldwin Theater Last Night.
PLAYS AT THE
CITY THEATERS,
"Mme. Sans Gene" Makes
a Hit at the Baldwin
Last Night.
MISS KIDDER'S SyCCESS
The Alcazar Opens Again With
a Fine New Stock
Company.
-TURNED UP" A FUNNY FARCE
Second Wee:: of "Social Trust" at
the Columbiaâ New Bills at
Other Places.
Not since the initial appearance of John
Drew as a star has the Baldwin held !>o
bnliittnt an audience as the one that
greeted the opening performance of th*
'â¢Sans Gene" company las*, e v-e : i i :i pr. Scat
tered all over the houÂ«e were handsomely
gowned women, representatives of the
local 400.
As is usual with a fashionable audience,
the curtain had risen on the stirring first
Bcene of the drama and not one-tenth of
the audience was as yet seated. In fact,
the prologue was nearly over before the
fashionable procession down the center
aisle had ende !.
Sardou wrote "Mme. Sans Gene" when
: the recent Napoleon craze was at its
I height, but we are still too near the days
! of the First Empire for a dramatist to pre
j Â«ume to take poetic license with the mem
j ory of le petit caporai, which perhaps ac
â¢ counts for the fact that Napoleon has not
been made the central figure of the play.
Mme. Sans Gene, the wile of one of his
i marshals, appears in that capacity, and
I with her brilliant N'xpn er-nic background
j she quite cap;ured her first Sau Francisco
] audience.
The background had a good deal to do
with last night's success, for "Mme. Sans
Gene" is to a great extent a sories of gor
geous tableaux, with one ficure, that of
the ex-washerwoman, standing out warm
and lifelike among the other somewhat
etilted dramatis persome, v|] U g.va one
the impression of being on a continual
drcrf, parade. One had to look round at
the familiar btalls and boxes to be quite
sure that the house was really the Bald
win and not Drury Lane, in the days
when the late lamented Sir Augustus
Harris spent money like water in mount
ing his productions.
Such velvets and satins, yards and
yards of them trailing over the stage in
regal magnificence. Such jewelry! to look
at it made one wink and blink ! Such uni
forms f and they were not made according
to the eostumer's fervid Imagination, either
they were copies from tho pomp and panoply
of war in which Napoleon decked out is
grande armeeâ lancers, hussars, dragoons
spurred and booted, glittering with gold and
silver, and many of them mi.de up as very
good counterparts of the historic people they
represented.
The staging of "Mine. Sans Gene" was as
gorgeous ah its costuming; indeed, really
beautiful reproductions were given of rooms
in the historic chateau of Compeigiie, and the
stirring scene in'the prologue, with the sol
diers and the singing oi the "kfarseUleue," was
excellently done.
But after all "the play's the thine." id It
seems as though Sardou must have been think
ing, when he wrote "Sans Gene," of tne advice
given by the husband of a great* prima
donna to his wife's impresario: "Get
my wife and a few sticks." Tin- play is
Sans Gene herself and very little else, and that
several of the other performers were any; lung
but sticks is not Sardou's fault for he gave
them very few opportunities for displaying
ta ent.
Sans Gene being the central figure of the
play it follows that the success of the per
formance depended largely upon Miss Khthrvn
Kidder, who played the role.
Her acting was a delightful surprise and the
audience showed their appreciation of it by
repeated curtain calls at the end of each art
s-ne is tall and willowy, with a pleasa-u albeit
penetrating voice, and the charming ease and i
abandon with which Mie played the part of I
the washerwoman Duchess was something
which recalled Ellen Terry's lightness
and grace in comedy roles. She had
to run the gamut of a good many emo
tions, irom impatience at tne annoyances
of a court train to grief at the
Emperor's resolve to have her friend De Neip
perg strangled, but she was always natural
Â« ml delightful in the expression of her feel
ings.
1 he plot of "Mme. Sans Gene" is too familiar
to need lengthy repetition. it shows in a
prologue how the waihcrwomnn Catherine
Hulbscher paves an Austrian officer, De Neip
perg, during the revolution from the wrath of
the Fr< nch populace with the help of her
finncee, Lofebvre. ami later shows how she
rescues hi..* ngain when Lefebvre has become
a Duke mi . 'tun Emperor suspects the Austrian
of being the Ei... reis 1 lover.
The story also s>i.ows how Napoleon trie* to
make Lefebvre divorce his Wile, If me. Sans
Gene, for her free and easy manners and how
Sans Gene herself wins his favor and makes
him her friend.
Several of the supporting characters were
well laved, particulary Augustus Cook as
Napoleon, Harold Russell as. Lefebvre and
Charles Plunkett as the dancing master.
Among those noted in the audience
were:
Mr. and Mrs. J. Downey Hftrvey ana party,

"The Social Trust" began its second â week at
the Columbia last evening, and judging from
the gooil house Mr. Frawley continues to get
on well with the theater-going public. It is a
P".ml play and better ]>lay<>d every night.
Blanche Bates and Landing Rowan aiid lntie
Hope Ross still carry off Lhe feminine honorn,
while Lackaye, Krawley and Arbuckle come in
for the male distinction. "The Social Tiust"
will run this week.
At tlie Orpheum.
Fllson and Krrol, In their comedy, "Men vs.
Women," have introduced an using turn at
the Orpheum this week. They are sup posed to
be an unhappily married couple, who in the
course of their marital discussions introduce
some tart and humorous dialogue respecting
the relative merits of men and women. Th
audience won.d be at a loss to say whether the
husband or wife nagged with the most persist
ency, though both did it with a spirit which
won them plenty ul applause.
Lydla Yeamans-Titus is i laying a brief en
gagement at the Orpheum this week. Her
voice has not lost any of its sweetness, and she
introduces some new songs, though the baby
act is still her most ropulur impersonation.
The Cosman couple, a pair of English music
hall stars, are expected to arrive in a few days
to complete this week's list of new attractions.
Miss .N'cuie Maguire has abando ( l tier char
act<r impersonations and is attempting a
pathetic style of ditty, which does not suit her
ball so well as did the "coster girl." Bioaard
Fltrot rases pandemonium with his living
pictures of statesmen. Some of the audience
now ro armed with fish-horns, in order to bet
ter express their feelings. Albini has some
good new card tricks, ana Favor and Sinclair's
Laughing skit proves as amusing as ever. Jlerr
Techow's cducaied cats are in the last week of
their engagement.

Natal! a-. Elvira, Blgnor Fernando Miebelena
as Ãrnanl, Signor Abramofl Â»^ linn Suva, and

The Grand Opera-Hoaiie.
A play full <f thrilling situations, grand
scenery and strikiu,- table-ux is "Held in
Slavery/ "i nt was presented for the first time
In the Grand Opera-house last nii;ht. The
story is that of a young girl, who is the victim
of a villain. He fir. 's that she is a slave, and
he has her put up at auction and purchases
her nims If.
There is, however, a young sailor, whose
mother the young glri had befriended, and he
after many trims and rights and i arrow
escapes succeed* in slaying the villsin and
rescues the girl from slavery.
Harry Sedley, specially engaged, took tlic
part of the sailor and made most of the char
acter. Helen Foster Vane was the heiress
slave and ','Hve a fairly good presentation of
the part, but the lite of tne piece were Lottie
Williams and E<l J. llorron, who assumed the
comedy parts of the melodrama. In their
work they were very good and exceed-
Ingly appreciated by the audience. One fea
ture in the fiist hci that took well was the
dancing pickaninnies.
Opening of tlie Aloazar.
The AlCHzar awoke last evening from its
long sleep and cave a crowded house an ex
cellent eutertainmoiii in the shape of tnat
very funny affair called "Turned Up " It is a
play often given by Nat Goodwin and was con
sidered by him as one of his best.
Most of the members of the Alcazar stock
company are well known here and have
played leading parts in first-class Eastern
companies, principally those otFrohmanand
Harridan. Mrs. F. M. Hates, the mother of
winsome Blanche of the Columbia, was a star
in the old Baldwin, and Mrs. Vanderboff
played with Kelcey and Effle - Shannon at the
California.
Amy Lee acted a leading role in "Siberia,"
J. B. Polk with "Our Strategist" and Adele
Belgarde was with Fro man for yecrs.
The interior of the Alcazar "has been en
tirely renovated and redecorated by Messrs.
Belasco. Doane and Jordan, the managers, and
j the beautiful new stajre settings show the
work of a muster scenic painter, making it one
! of the handsomest theaters in the City.
J hÂ»Â» opening performance last evening was
somewhat delayed, as tile rehearsals had been
necessarily hurriel, but if the time between
curtains were long the line musical programme
under the direction of Edward Ladu tilled in
the waits.
The play of the evening was preceded by a
curtain-raiser, "The Little Rebel," in which
Amy Lee took the leading part.
"Turned Up" hangs upon an old naval
officer, Captaiu Midway, who is posed to
have become "iood for the mackerels," and
his wife marries again. When he . returns
home there, is fun and tears commingled.

Wonderful bursts of speed were made
during the daylight hours yesterday by

Erswell and Dietrick, famous riders,
who carried the packet from Rawlins to
Fort Steele Sunday night, were precipi
tated into a rushing torrent twelve feet
deep. It is a miracle that they escaped
with their lives. The night was pitch
dark. Ersweli went in first and Dietrick
on top of him. They floundered about
and managed to clamber <mv and save
their wheels. Erswell's head was cut and
lm face bruised by his partner's wheel.

HIS HORRIBLE DEATH.
Patrick Gleeson Insisted Upon
Finishing the Last
Flange
Patrick Gleeson did not take the advice
of the foreman of the boiler-shops at the
Risdon Iron Works last evening, and now
his body is in the Morgue.
Gleeson is a flance-turner in the boiler
shops, and about 5 o'clock be was eajraffed
turninir the fiances on a reuhot boiler-head
suspended from a hydraulic crano when
the horrible uccident Happened that caused
his death.
One of the pulleys became detached and
the boiler-faea 1 swung to one side. Giei.'
son attempted to ri^ht it, but the bolt that
hi i id tlie clutch and chain together brnka.
The biiiicr-head, w ich weighnl ovor IHiXK)
poti'id-", begun to descend, and Qleeson,
comprehending his dancer, turned to run,
but stuniDled over a piece of broken metal
an i fell.
B^f to hÂ° could craw! out of the way
the boiler head was upon him, crushing
his rijrht side and terribly bruising his
i arm, chest and leg. Several of his fellow
workmen \*-ho saw the accident rushed to
<>ie son's assistance. After great diffi
! culty they pulled h m out of his deatli
; trap, and, as he showed sipns of lite, they
j rang for the patrol wair<m, ana Gleeson
| w:Â»> taken to the Receiving Hospit.il. ria
died on the operating t^hle, and his body
! was removed to the Morgue.
' The foreman Â«;aid that Oleeson had, a
few minutes before the accident, been told
to quit work, lie declined, saying h<j had
only one more dance to turn to complete
the job. His u-si-tant had quit when or
ilered, but Gleeson called bim back and
toid him to gee ready to remove the last
flange. A second time he wan told to
Quit work and home, and less than a
minute afterward he was fatally injured.
Gleefton was 47 years of age, and lived at
97 California avenue. He leaves a widow
to mourn his loss.

â â â â â¢
The Bryan party is made up of all kinds
of factions, led by all sorts of cranks, and
if it should get into office it couldn't work
together.
Â° It is hard to find a good Republican
who has left his party in this campaign,
and it is hard to find a good Democrat
who hasn't.
Before we get through with this cam
paign it will be hard to tell whether
Bryan is a Democrat, a Populist, a revolu
tionist or a what is ii.
To old Li Hung Chang the tomb of
Grant was more impressive than the pres
ence of the living Cleveland, and so in
deed it is to most men.
In denouncing wealth the Democratic
organs are consistent with their party, for
it has done everything it could to make
the people poor and keep them so.
The Indianapolis convention can hardly
put together a platform of any value in
politics, but it can make a raft for con
servative Democrats to cling to when the
tidal wave sweeps the country.
As if the Cuban war were not enough
for her 6pain has stirred up a revolt in the
Philippine Islands, and now General
Weyler is likely to have a companion in
misery to sympathize with him.
So long as foreign goods are allowed to
drive American goods out of the American
market, so long will American mills,
money and men be idle and American
homes ftel the pressure of hard times.
The report that Cleveland can have the
nomination of the Indianapolis conven
tion if he wishes it shows that Democratic
leaders never attain to complete R<jud
sense, even when they bolt their party.
The "honest coin Democrats," as they
call themselves, claim they will be able to
carry Alabama, Florida, Kentucky and
Texas, and it will be an interesting feature
of the campaign to watch them try to do it.
One of the notable features of the cam
paign is the active part which earnest
patriotic women are taking on the Kepub
lican side, and there can be no question
that much of the success of the party on
election day will be due to their efforts.
In attempting to make the support of
McKiniey by Mr. Estee and Mr. Â£cott
appear inconsistent with their advocacy
of the remonetizatiou of silver the Demo
crats overlook the broad difference be
tween bimetallism and Bryauism, but the
people won't overlook it.
Every investigation into the alleged re
ports of Republican disaffection among
farmers of the Mississippi Valley dis
closes a much weaker Bryan sentiment
than was supposed. Instead of gaining
anything the Popocrat combination is
growing weaker every day.
The Repnolican pledge to promote the
free coinage of silver by international
agreement offers the only solution of the
money problem which good business men
can accept, and for that reason even the
Democrats among them are working with
the Republican party this year and will
vote for McKiniey.
Even if the Republicans of California
were not pledged to support the woman
suffrage amendment they would find
abundant reasons lor doing bo in recogni
tion of the effective work that iÂ« being
done for the party by women's Repub
lican clubs in various parts of the State.
Those who have deserved the ballot
ought to have the ballot.
A. B. Sheldon of Sherman, N. V., adver
tises fa the .\riig of teat city that for the
purpose of assisting those who believe in
the White metal he will buy all kinds of
livestock and pay extra high prices for
them in Mexican dollars. This is giving
a chance to the Bryanites 01 the State,
but we have beard 01 none of them taking
it. Some may accept Bryanism as poli
tics, but no gne wishes it us a business
0 r. reposition.
WILLIAM M'KINLEY.
Major McKiniey grows in public favor
quite as fast on his personal account as he
does on account of the principles he stands
for as the repre.-entative of the Republican
party. Delegations of workincmen, farm
ers and niana^rrs of great business enter
prises call upon him every 'day, and they
go away impressed by his manliness and
thorough Americanism. He realizes that
he is not only the leader of the Republi
can hosts, but ti at conservative men of
vt her parties are flocking to his banner,
and that responsibilities of great weight
and purport are soon to be placed in his
keeping ; but instead of parading his own
importance, as his competitor does, he
takes the people into his contidenco and
confers with them.
Major McKiniey Las every reason to
believe that so sure as November comes so
sure will the jieople call upon him to
direct the affairs of the country. He is
facing a crave and weighty responsibility,
he knows, and like a true man of the peo
ple, he mingles with the people, that he
may be in touch with them. Major Mc-
Kiiiley dees not speak of "my platform,"
nor say what "I will do"'; nor does he try
to set brother against brother; but the
burden of all his utterances is the good of
all the people. He talks of protection be
cause it is back of protection where pros
perity He talks of patriotism
because he loves the institutions of his
country better than he loves the glory of
being President, He talks of opening: the
shops and mills and factories because he
knows that labor, without reference to
party affiliation, is in need of employ
ment. He talks of the possibilities of
America because America is his birth
place and Americans are his fellows.
There is no pomp or ceremony when the
people cometo Major McKiniey in throngs,
but it is like a gathering together of fel
low-citizens who have come to exchange
greetings and plan for the good of every
man and woman and child in all this
broad land. The people assare him of
their confidence in his high sense of right
and in the integrity of h;s manhood, and
he asks for their moral support in the
mighty work of rebuilding the places laid
waste by a mistaken policy in the conduct
of their public affairs. That honors are
being thrust upon him Major McKiniey
well knows, but he bears them as one who
realizes that they mean duty, and who
will do iiis whole duty. More and more
is his splendid manhood revealed as the
days come and go, and every day is re
vealed more of his lofty Americanism and
his sincere devotion to t lie best interests
of his fellow-citizen 3. The St. Louis con
vention builded wiser than it knew when
it nominated William McKiniey.
Jf we coin a silver dollar of full legal
tender, obviously below the current value of
the gold dollar, we are opening wide our
doors and inviting Europe to take our gold.
With our gold flowing out from us we shall
be jorced to the sinate silver standard, and
our relations with, the leading commercial
countries of the world will be not only em
barrassed but crippled. â James G. Elaine.
SIMON-PORE DEMOCRATS.
The National Democratic party will
meet in convention in Indianapolis, Ind.,
to-morrow to r.ominate candidates for
President and Vice-Tresident. The best
brains and the conservatism of Democracy
will be there and a clear and strong
declaration ot principles may be expected.
The Bryanitoa s^ay it will be a convention
ol bolters, wnich is in a measure true, but
as the managers of the Indianapolis affair
declare that the Chicago convention
bolted the principles and traditions of the
party, the convention to-morrow will be
the only National convention of the
Simon-pure Democrats held this year.
Bryan himself is perfectly willing that his
wing of the party shall be calied '"Bryan's
party," fur that kind of claptrap glory is
quite to his likine. He refers to the plat
form of the Chicago convention as '"my
platform" and to the principles it declares
for as "my principles," ami in many other
way- he impresses the public with the idea
that it is Bryan and not any party or any
declaration of principle that the country
is in need 01.
The fact is apparent, though, that every
Democrat who has become distinguished
by the force of his own character is giving
support to the cause for which the In
dianapoiis convention stands, and would
very much prefer to see Major McKiniey
elected than to see the country turned over
to liryanism. In that respect these Demo
crats are truly patriotic, and it proves that
when it comes to a showdown they are for
the good, peace and prosperity of the coun
try lirst. No doubt they honestly believe
that if the people would elect their candi
dates the country would be very much bet
ter off, but as between A.ltgeldisni and
Republicanism no choice is left; that
Alt^eldism is not to be accepted at aii
under any kind of circumstances, and that
Major McKiniey will at least give the
nation an honest and dignified adminis
tration.
There are very many prominent Demo
crats, however, who will not give aid aiid
comfort to the Indianapolis convention's
purpose â not because they have departed
the faith, but because they believe the
better way to cru>h out Bryanism is to
support M ajor McKiniey. Bourke Cockran
of New York. Charles A. Dana, editor of
the New York Hun, Professor Jones of the
California State University and John Mar
tin of San Fianciscoare among the old
line Democrats who will vote for Major
McKiniey lor "prudential reasons." Of
course there is a bond of sympathy be
tween ail true Democrats and all true
Republicans ju.-Â«t now because Bryan is
threatening interests that are common to
all, and there ia no reason why they
should not work in perfect harmony to
overthrow one who proclaims hostility to
our system of government, as does the
man from Nebraska.
/ have believed, and believe to-day, thnt
any system that maintains the prices of labor
in this country and brings hope into the life of
tlvt laboring man, that enables him to put by,
is the policy that should be our American
policy. I have misted in many campaigns
this idea that a debased currency could help
the workingman. The jGtlf dirty errand that
a dirty dollar dors Â£? to cheat the workimj
man. â Ex-President Harrison,
SILVER AND GOLD MONEY
The supporters of the Chicupo nominees
must be getting alarmed when they try to
strengthen their cause by charging that
the Republican party is the enemy of bi
metallism. Bryan hirust'lf cays the St.
â¢Louis platform declares for bimetallism,
only that it does not provide for a direct
enough way to secure it. The fact Is, the
Chicago platform does not mean bimetal
lism by either a direct or an indirect way.
It means silver monometallism pure and
simple; whereas the declaration of the
Republican party 19 emphatic in its de
mand for the employment of both gold
and silver by commerce.
It may be said without fear of success
ful contradiction that the plan of the Re
publican party to make the silver dollar
the equal and companion of the gold
dollar as redemption money is the only
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTE3IBEU 1, 1596.
feasible solution of the problem. Indeed
it is not a problem at nil if examined from
a common business sense standpoint. It
revives itself into the one proposition of
all parties in interest agreeing upon a plan
for giving the metals a common basis of
debt-paying and purchasing power.
No great amount of common-sensn is
needed to understand tbat In matters in
which two or more are interested all in
interest must agree to any change in
the form of conducting their mutual
affairs. This is the way the Republican
party views the question of bimetallism,
and it proposes to invite ail who are in
terested with us in a commercial way to
join with us in fixing a basis for increasing
the volume of circulating money by giving
the silver dollar the same standing in the
channels of trade that the gold dollar
has.
It is not a question of gold money nor
of eilver money, but a question of money
enough 10 supply tbe demands of com
merce for money, and since silver and
gold possess qualities which no other
metals do for that purpose, the reason
ableness of the proposition to have those
who would employ the additional volume
meet ana agree upon a plan for maintain
ing the new additional issue on a parity
with tne old should bo plain to every
thinking person. The Republican party
ii committed to bimetallism and it is com
mitted to oppose both silver and gold
monometallism.
In my opinion there is no issue presented
by t!u Chicago convention more important or
vital than the question they have raised of
prostituting the power and the duly of the
National courts and the National executive.
The defense of the constitution, of the Su
preme Court of the United States, and the
President's power and duty to enforce all of
the laws of the United States without await
ing the call or consent of the Governor of any
State, is an important and living issue in
this campaign. â Ex-President Harrison.
THE TIDE HAS TURNED.
The convention of conservative Demo
crats called for the purpose of repudiating
Bryanism will find on meeting at Indian
apolis nothing more to do than to provide
a refuge for themselves. Bryanism is no
longer a serious menace to the country.
Republicans have met it so vigorously, in
dependents have denounced it so firmly,
and the common-sense of the people has
so spontaneously rejected it, that nothing
is left for conservative Democrats to do
except to get on the side ol good citizens
and save themselves irom political ruin by
giving notice they are not responsible for
the Chicago platform and ticket, and do
not intend to give them even the support of
silence.
There has been in all sections of the
country a notable failing away from the
Popocrat fusion. Sincere advocates of
free silver coinage and the restoration of
the bimetallic financial system who were
at first inclined to support the Ch'cago
ticket and even showed some enthusiasm
on its behalf have taken a sober second
thought and will no lor.per have anything
to do with it. This diminution of zeal on
the part of intelligent bimetallisms is ob
served in all sections of the Union, not
excepting such strong silver States as
Colorado and Utah. The free-coinage tide
is in fact failing as rapidly as it rose, and
it is now doubtful if Bryan will receive as
many as luO electoral votes.
For the cbanee that is coming over the
advocates of bimetallism many causes are
apparent. In the first place, the Republi
can pledge to promote the free coinage of
silver by international agreement is to
most men a more valuable assurance of a
return to bimetallism than is offered by
the wild pledges of the Chicago platform
and the Chicago candidates. In the sec
ond place, the importance of the tariff
is-ue is growing in the minds of all en
gaged in protective industries, and they
do not care to run the ris-K of free silver
coupled with free trade, closed mills and
id.c men. Moreover, the Chicago plat
form is an open attack upon the constitu
tional powers of the President and the
Supreme Court, and the speeches of
Bryan have exhibited an unmistakable
sympathy with Altgeld, Tiilman and
otters who procured the adoption of the
revolutionary planks by the convention.
Each of these causes taken alone is suf
ficient to turn men of business away from
the Bryan movement, and in the aggre
gate they constitute a force too strong to
be resisted by any save the most hide
bound partisans. Western men who have
been advocating the free coinage of Bilver
for years and Southern men who have
been brought up from infancy in the faith
of Bourbon Democracy are either coming
out openly for McKiniey or are announc
ing an intention to vote for the conserva
tive Democrat to be nominated at Ir.diau
apolis. A poll taken recently by the presi
dent of the Farmers' Association of Indi
ana showed that of the 50,000 members of
that organization abont 40,000 will vote
for McKiniey and sound money. Equally
good reports come from the Southern
States. Kentucky will not vote for Bryan.
West Virginia is sure for MrKinley and
Tennessee is about as sure. The tide, in
fact, has turned. Bryanism will be ex
hausted long before election day comes
round.
Now, I put it to you at men of sense, plain
mm of sense, would yon lend vwtin/ if you
had it to any man or set of men, or arm no

ABOUT THE WOOL INDUSTRY.
To wool, the prodvet of the meat industry
of sheep husbandry, as well as to the finithed
woolens of the mill, we promise the most ample
protection. â L'epublican National Platform.
To this W. J. iiryan says: "Speaking
for myself, it is immaterial in my opinion
whether the sheep-grower receives any
benefit from the tariff or not. I am for
free â wool."
The solicitude of the Republican party
for the well-being of the sheep industry
and the indifference of Mr. Hryan marks
the difference between Republicanism and
Bryanism in their attitude toward all the
American people If Mr. Bryan's utter
ances on the tariff question mean anything
at all, they mean that in his opinion the
citizens of the United States should hnve
no advantage in their own country over
citizens of other countries who would
dwarf our industries that their own might
prosper. Mr. Bryan dees not appear to
be imbued with the spirit of Americanism,
nor does he seem to have pride in the
greatness of the possibilities of his coun
try. Why be should be more solicitous
for the welfare of the labor and the busi
ness enterprises of other countries than
for those in his own land is a question he
alone can answer.
By and with the aid and consent of Mr.
Bryan the Bheep industry of hia fellow
countrymen has been ruined by leeisla
tion which depreciates the value of Amer
ican wool and increases the value of
foreicn wool. Since the Wilson-Gorman
tariff act became operative American wool
has sustained an average decline in price of
42 per cent and foreign wool had advanced
9 per cent. In the great wool market of
the world, London, England, the average
price of wool was about 51 per cent below
the s:irae qualities in this country from
IÂ£b7 to the end of the operation of the
McKiniey law. The Wilson-Gorman act
has not only wiped out ali that, but has,
as we have said, advanced wooi prices in
London 9 per cent and lowered prices of
American wool 42 per cent. In view ot
these facts Mr. Bryan should explain to
American sheep-raisers why he says, "I
am for free wool."
Some idea of the disastrous results of
the operation of Bryan's free-wool policy
will be had when it is said that the excess
in raw-wool imports during the first year
of the Wilson-Gorman act over the last
year of the McKiniey law was, in round
numbers, 190,000,000 pounds. The excess
in imports in rags, waste, shoddy and
similar material during the same period
was, on tbe basis of unwashed wool, 50,
-000,000 pounds. The excess in the impor
tations of wool in manufactured form, ex
clusive of shoddy, etc., in the same period
was 90,000,000 pounds. This makes the
total excess of importations of wool,
shoddy, etc., in raw material and manu
factured goods, for the first year.of Bryan's
kind of a tariff as compared with the last
year of the McKiniey act, 330,000,000
pounds.
Not only has Bryan's tariff policy enor
mously increased wool and wool product
imports, thus bringing our wool industry
in competition with low-wage countries,
but it bas forced a ruinous reduction in
the price of American wool. Then there
should betaken into account the flocks of
sheep that have been slaughtered and
marketed as mutton because prices of
wool under the Wilson-Gorman law do
not justify keeping sheep for the clip. It
would be very difficult to get at the exact
loss the wool and woolen-goods industries
have sustained under Bryan's free-trade
law, because the loss to labor on account
of being forced into idleness could not
well be ascertained but that it may be
counted by the tens of millions there ia no
doubt whatever.

Superior Jndse John M. Corcoran of Mariposa County. Who Has Been on the

[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
He does not seem, howevor, more than fifty
years of age.
He says that Marlposa county Is getting in a
good deal better condition than formerly, aud
that parts of the- county are pretty active.
" I think that for two years pnst," said the
judge, " from 500 to 600 more men have been
employed than formerly. The mine owners
are giving their attention to deep mining also,
and all aioiu' tri<; motner lode in Mariposa
county, in different places, deep shafts are
beins sunk.
"No mines, generally speaking, have ever
paid that were not deep, and experienced
miners who know this are sinking deep. Wnen
mining has been followed as a legitimate in
dustry in Manposa it has always proved suc
cessful.
"I think a great deal of the county an<l of
its resources. Thore are a number of big prop
erties there that have for a long timo been
Idle. Senator Jones, the Hobam and others
have owned some of these.
"There is a general desire to see all the
mines resume work. This would bring about
a more prosperous era, for it is generally con
ceded that the properties are rich, or at least
many of them."
The judge is here on a vacation. He has a
great many friends in this City.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
IS IT A WHAT IS IT?
Do McKinlky Republicans Really Want
International Bimetallism?
To the Editor vj the San Francisco Callâ Stk:
As a plain Populist possessed of faculties
which readily grasp the principle underlying
the construction of the multiplication table
without assistance shall I expose myselt to
contempt it I cuuiess that I need the help of a
good McKiniey Republican to enable me to
understand the logic ol ttie Republican argu
ment made by Major McKiniey, General Harri
son and others of like faith against the free
coinage of silver as a hurtful xueasuruwhiie at
the same time they champion the proposal to
secure international bimetallism?
Let me stale the case in other terms. The
Republican platform expressly Bays: "We are
opposed to the free coinage of silver except by
an international agreement with the leading
commercial nations of the earth, which
agreement we pledge ourselves to promote,
and until such agreement can be obtained the
existing gold standard must be maintained."
Thut is all plain enough with the exception of
the possible Tunic faith implied in making in
ternational bimetallism dependent upon an
agreement with the lcauiug commercial
nations of the earth while they are all opposed
to bimetallism and are all conducting their
business on the bus-Is of the single gold stand
ard. But bow do the ablest leaders of the Re
publican party interpret their platform?
In a brief letter it is not possible to trans
cribe much of what they teach us as to the
nature of the proposed international bimetal
lism. (At this, point I laid aside my pen, and
I have spent an hour in trying to find what
Major McKinley in ids letter of acceptance and
General IlurrUon in his Yew York speech mean
by the term international bimetallism as ap
plied to the ratio between silver and gold,
whether it be 10 to 1 or 31 to 1 or tome point
between 10 and 31.) This is as near as 1 can
come to it: Major UcKinley says: "On August
22, 1801, in a. public address I &aid, 'It we
could have an international ratio, which all
the leading nations of the world would adopt,
and the true relation be tixed between the two
metals and all agree upon the quantity silver
which should constitute a dollar, then silver
would be as free and unlimited in its privi
leges of coinage as gold is to-day. But we have
not beÂ«n able to secure it, and with free and
unlimited coinage," etc.â lie goes on 10 set
lorta 'he evils of free coinage. That is ail
he has to say about au "international ratio"
or "International bimetallism." Satisfactory,
definite, tangible, is it? But whatever illu
sory thing It is we have the assurance thai
he and his party "pledge themselves to pro
mote" it. â.-....',, \-- â¢â _ : \j
As a plain Populist I am trying to find what
Major JlcKinley offers me under the terms
"international agreement," "international
bimetallism," "international ratio" as a good
thing for ail the leading nations of the world,
instead of free coinage, which is a bad thin,,,
and especially bad for the United Mates. Once
more I will try to tind out whet General Harri
son offers me and other Populists In place of
this pernicious free coinage of silver, which it
seems no one found pernicious from the foun
dation of the Government down to 1873, a
period of nearly 100 years; and even when
John Sherman did find it out on that dark
night when it was demonetized it was at a
premium over gold at the dread ratio of 16
tol. ..;--â â¢. â  ;; â  â  -..- â¢ -..
Now let us hear General Harrison, our good
ex-President, who. is conceded to be an able
expounder of international law. tie nays, in
his New York speech in Carnegie Hall, August
27: '-Bui now, friends, there is a great deal of
S. D. C.
! talk about bimetallism, of the double standard
and a great deal oi con fusion in the use of those
terms. Bimetallism is the use of two metals as
money Where they are both used." There now!
! That is a definition for youâ "where they are
; both used." But lie continues: "By a double
! standard they mean that we nave a gold dollar
I ami a silver" wtiica shall be units of value,"
I etr. "Now our fathers thought," and then he
rambles on and tells us how our fathers fixed
the ratio between silver nnd gold, and says:
[ "Xow so nice were our people about this in
i trying to adjust this that they went into deci
| mal fractions. We say 16 to 1. It is 15.938
I plus."
I hope my renders will turn to this remnrk
! able speech and note how (ienerai. Harrison
j then proceeds at great lenath to show up the
follies of the united friends of silver â the
Bryan Democrats, the Bryan Republicans and
| the Bryan Populistsâ for trying to restore
eilver to free coinage on this nicely adjusted
basis of 15.988 plus, which was given us by
the fathers alihougn ho nowhere intimates
that it had failed to prove a blessing to the
country during the eighty-<-.ne years of ittÂ»
coutinuance from 1792 10 1873.
I ask my readers to carefully go through
this great speech by General Harrison to see
it he has one word to say about this matter of
international bimetallism, tnis "international
agreement" wnich the Republican platform
offers the country in place of the long-tried
free coinage of silver; and yet General Har
rison is under pledge to promote this great
boon of an "international agreement." Why
is he so silent about Its merits?
And now what in fact is this "international
agreement," this "international bimetallism,"
wnicn is commended to us by McKld ley Re
publicans? What are its terms, supposing
there is the remoiest prospect that we could
ever secure ii ironi nations opposed to it? Is
it not in fact a financial nondescript, a verit
able "What Is It?" We all know what free
coinage of silver is at the ratio of sixteen
ounces of silver to one ounce of gold, and we
know what it has done for the country; and
we also know to our sorrow what it is to be de
prived of it for the past twenty-three years,
and to be forced to the present hard condi
tions of the slnele gold standard, which Mc-
Kiniey Republicans tell us must be main
tained till ttie leading commercial nations of
UÂ»e earth are willing to abandon it, though
they all favor it and transact their business on
it. Surely it seems very much like a scheme
10 bewilder the poor Populists and if possible
to load ihem into the gold camp.
"Which agreement we pledge ourselves to
promote," says the Republican platform, and
we must assume that it is meant to be taken
seriously, even if Major McKiniey and Gen
eral Harrison, admittedly the highest authori
ties in elucidating its meaning, do fail to tell
us what this "international agreement" or
"international ratio," as McKiniey calls it,
will prove to be, provided these leading com
mercial nations, now all guld-busis countries,
ever should adopt it. If, then, tuis pledge to
promote the adoption of an international ratio
I is to be taken seriously and our votes are to
be given in favor of it rather than for free
coinage we are to rest our faith on the as
surance that it will ao justice to silver and
will benefit the nations that enter into the
agreement. As this ratio can only be found by
taking account of the relative quantities of
gold and silver in the world ana the relative
production of the two metals it cannot vary
inn. h fiom 16 tOl, though the present greatly
increasing production of gold may- fix it at or
below the Europemi ratio, 15}-i tol. But let
ussuppi.se thnt it would prove to be 18 to 1,
or even 20 to 1, wliat would follow?
Do you not see what would follow? Why, all
the evils and disasters predicted by Major Mc-
Kiniey, General Harrison and all the Republi
can orators, nameh , the lo.>s to pensioners,
savings banks depositors, holders of life in
surance policies und wage-earners would just
aÂ» surely follow interuatlonnl bimetallism us
free coinage, with only this difference, that
these disasters would then be universal
throughcutall the leading eommercis! nations
of the earth instead of being confined to the
United Stales under independent tree coinage.
lt> there Â«ny escape from this conclusion?
It must be true that if international bi
metallism U not an unmitigatedsham, a clever
scheme to fool the people and thereby per
petuate the present gold standard, it would be
laden with all the dire calamities attributed
by gold men to free coinage, militated only
by a possible increase in the ratio, aud no in
crease is at nil probable. Ah, these evils are
unsubstantial shadows, affecting only one in
sixty of the people as compared with the solid
and" permanent benefits of free coinage, and
they are conjured up by gold men to terrorize
voters who dn not understand the money ques
tion and load them to rote for McKinlev and
for the gold standard to be continued. Tuink
it 00 1 to the end, render. Then sec where you
stand. Joseph ASBOST Jounson.

WAS THE PENCIL
WILL REVOKED?
Interesting Argument on
Van R. Paterson's Op
position.
CLAIMS OF A NEW WILL.
The Written Statement of No
vember 26 Said to Be
Equivalent to One.
WHEELER STATES HIS CASE.
Only a Testamentary Codicil as a
Destruction of the Later Will
Could Revoke It.
Van R. Paterson and Charles S. Wheeler
had it out yesterday morning in the mat
ter of Mr. Faterson's opposition to the
Fair will of September 24. On Friday last
Mr. Wheeler, having been ruled against in
his demurrer to Judge Paterson's fourth
amended opposition, moved to striKe out
from the opposition ail reference to the
revocation of the will of the 21st. HÂ« took
the position that the two groui^ of con
test â that of forgery and that of revoca
tion â were inconsistent and must be
offered separately.
Judge Paterson asked for time to reply,
and the date was tiled for yesterday
morning.
Judge Paterson, in the course of his
argument, was called upon to distinctly
define his position, and in doing so that
of ail the other contestants to the will of
the 21st, on at least one material point.
Judge Paterson claims that the repubhea
tion, dated November 20, was. in effect a
re-execution ol the will of the 21st, and
gives to that will, in law, the date of
November 26.
In speaking of the matter Judge Pater
son said: "It was claimed here, if I un
derstand counsel, that the two points of
our contest must be settled separately;
that the allegation of republication and
the allegation of forgery might not be
contained in the one contest. This we
deny. We hold that the date of the re-
Eublication is now the date of the will of
eptember 21. If there be any authorities
opposed to tins proposition tney have not
come under my notice. It has been al
leged that a cancellation, revocation or a
destruction by tire of a subsequent will
will not revive a prior will. What then
will revive a prior will? A republication.
We have a will of September 21, a will of
September 24, under the republication a
will of November 26. Does not that settle
the controversy? It has been set up here
that we are compelled to state our two
grounds of opposition.
"I wish to say to the court and counsel
that we are not obliced to do so. If, after
consultation, we deem it advisable we may
do so, out the matter lies with us. Can
we be compelled to go beiore a jury and
say 'his wfll is a forgery, but we are un
able to prove it and so we will now fall
back on the repubiication ?' For myself I
would prefer to contest this will on the
ground of forgery, but i am maintaining
here that I am not compelled to make the
contest upon any sin.-le ground."
Mr. Wheeler in replying said : "Judge
Paterson takes the position that we Lave
no rijjht to compel him to state separately
his grounds of contest. Again he Bays
mat the date of what is termed by him a
republication gives to the will of Septem
ber 21 its own date, but that it is not
thereiore a separate cause of action."
Mr. Wheeler read some authorities in
line with his position requiring that
where two causes of action are united
they may be required to be separated.
With regard to the second point, he said:
"Judge Paterson's position simply is th:it
the will of the 24th is revoked by a still
later will. Hi- argument would be of
great effect if the republication toÂ«'k tne
form of a codicil. All that was intended
by the written statement of November 26
was to revoke the will of ttie 24th. Bui it
was ineffective because the requirements
of the law were not tullil.ed. It makes no
modification of the will of the 21st â does
not alter it nor cancel it. It is sinipiy a
written declaration, signed before wit
nesses, saying in so many words that the
will of the 21st wns his last will."
Judge Paterson asked leave to put the
question: "Suppose Senator Fair ha 1
again written his will on November 26 in
tne language of the will ot the- 21st, would
not that have revoked the will of the
24 th?"
'"Certainly," said Wheeler, "that would
be a re-execution, not a reiviblication."
"It is the .same," said Paierson.
"You do not plead it so. You state it
as a republication."
"We state what was done. The law
does the rest."
In answer to a question from Judire
Slack Mr. Wheeler said: "I do not hold
nor have I yet stated that the two grounds
of Judgo Paterson's opposition are too in
consistent to be joined. What I have said
is that they must be stated separately;
otherwise the court, the jury and the op
posing counsel are unable io determine
the limits of the proceedings or how they
shall meet and answer them. What
would be sufficient to get the will of the
24th out of the way? A codicil making
some modification of the provisions of the
earlier will or a destruction of the late
will. A mere statement declaring the last
will not to be the last will or that ari
earlier will is the .last will is not sulli
cient."
"You hold that the so-called republica
tion is of no effect at all?" asked the Jud c.
"Of no more than would be an oral
statement of mine to my clerk to take a
will out of my safe and burn it and I
should go to my grave thinking it burned
and it should turn up afterward."
"Supoose the will or tht 21<t had been
reattested November 20?" said hi^ Honor.
"That is the distinction I wouid call the
court's attention to. Reatte-tation is one
thin;,', republication is another. To re
attest thr will is to attach the signature
and date at the fool of the will itseU and
it becomes partof the document. It would
then carry the later Hate."
Mr. M> Enerrtey. by leave of Julge Pat
erson, took up the thread, making the
statement that he was no: of record in this
branch of the case. He stated that there
were many authorities to support the
statement that where a holographic state
ment is made referring to a previously
prepared w : ll it makes that will a new
will of the date of the tater writing.
'â¢Well." said Wheeler, "let us get at
what it doer,. Does it artest the will?"
''I don'' know tnat you would call it a
reattestation."
"Is it a codicil then?"
"I can't say we should call it a codicil,
and not a re-executionâ it makes it a new
will. There are a whole group of cases to
support the statement. Sui>j>ose, ' con- ''
tinued tfcEnerney, "that Mr. lair instead
of writing the will, simply had written,
â¢It is ray wish and dejlre that my prop- '
erty be distributed according to the
method set forth in my will dated Sep
tember 21,' and this had b en proi erly
sworn to beiore witnesses, what woulit
you have paid to that?"
"You are coming to my way of think
ing,' said Wheeler. "That would be a re- !
execution, an entirely different natter."
"It would "be a re-execution without j

being attached to the will," said Paterson.
"That beiiip; admitted we do not have to
allege it. We claim there is no material
difference."
"Only that you are trying to revoke a
will in some other manner than i 3 dis
tinctly provided by the laws."
With this Judi;e Slack said he under
stood the relative position of the contend
ing parties ana would decide the matter
next Friday, to which date all other mat
ters wore carried over.
MAY BE RESCINDED.
The Teachers' Council Resolution of
the Board of JKducatiou Under
Consideration.
At 5 o'clock this afternoon the Board of
Education will hold a special session,
called by President pro tern. Clinton, to
reconsider and, perhaps, rescind the action
by the board several months ago in re
questing that the TeÂ«cherÂ«' Council be
formed.
At that time the plan, which was pro
posed by Director Murdock, vas looKed
upon as a good one, and wheD the resolu
tion mentionea was brought up at a regu
lar meeting it was carried unanimously.
Having received the official sanction of
the buard those who had originated the
scheme began work at once, and it re
sulted recently in an election of olticers
and a permanent organization.
For some little time past, however
there has been an under current of dis
satisfaction among certain circles of
teachers, and the murmurs have reached
the ears of the members of the board.
lhose who do not favor the organization
say that its destiny is beinp shaped in
such a manner that a very few wilj con
trol the council, and that if they choose
these few can bring its entire influence to
bear for their own aggrandizement.

ARE NOW BUSY,
The Wynnstay Took In
Stiffening at the
Seawall.
TO LOAD AT PORT COSTA
Accident to the Tramp British
Steamer Linlithgow Near
Acapulco.
TRAMP STRATHQARRY LIBELED
"Tom," the God Cat on the Alamede,
Presented With a Silver
Collar.
The British ship Wvnnstay and the
Stockton steamer Mary Garratt were two
of the busiest vessels on the front yes
terday. The ship is at section 3of the sea
wall and is going to Port Costa to load
wheat for Europe. Every ounce of the
cargo that she brought to San Francisco
was taken out of her and in consequence
she had to be "stiffened" before a move
could be made. In order to get her suf
ficiently deep in the water to make navi- j
gation safe the Garratt brought several
hundred tons of wheat from Port Costa for
the ship. All day yesterday the work of
transferring the grain went on and when
the Wjnnstsy has 500 tons in her hold she
will be "stiffened" sufficiently to move or
be moved anywhere.
A number of other sailing ships are j
loading or taking in stiffening and all in I
all the wind-jammers have been busier
this last two or three days than at any
time sin^e the advent of the tramp !
steamer?. The sailing vessels now load- j
Ing, however, were nearly all chartered j
prior to arrival.
Ihe trump steamers are not having an !
altogether rosy time of it. The Linlith- i
gow, which sailed for Leith on July HI, j
with a carÂ«o of wheat, has broken flown, j
nnd is now driitmg around in midocean! I
The Strathtarry, also loaded with wheat,
has been attached by the United States !
Marshal, and Captain White is discon
solate.
All went well with the Linlithgow until
the coast of Central America was reached,
when the gland of the tail-shaft broke,
and the hie tramp went aarift. She was
near to Acapulco, and Captain Petrie sent
the chief ollicer ashore to ask for assist
ance. The laaer made land and notified
that the Linlithgi w was drifting in north
northeast direction. Tugs were sent out
to look for her.
When the Strathgarry started for Port
Costa one of the river pilots proffered his
assistance, but Captain White declined it.
On the return trip he did his own piloting
again, and when a bill for half pilotage
was put in he refused to pay it. Accord- j
in^'ly the river pilots lil.eled the vessel, I
and a United States marshal was put >
aboard. The chances iire I hat Captain j
White will pay the $100 and proceed on i
h H way a sadder, hut a wiser man.
"Tom," the pet cat of the Alaiueda, has j
a new collar and takes care that every- I
body sees it. He still keeps watch and I
ward over the quarters of Chief Engineer '
Little, but since the new silver collar was
fastened around his neck he has not been
nearly as aggressive as formerly. The cel
lar bears the inscription, "Old Tom. S. S.
Alameda. Presented by his American ad
mirers July 4, 1896." Chief Little asserts
that Tom is a "gold" cat and that a silver
collar has taken all the tight out of him.
The first of the salmon lleet, the
Llewellyn J. Morse, got in yesterday. The
captain reports a splendid catch, and says
that sometimes the runs were so heavy
that the fish could not be handled. The
Morse was seventeen days from Karluk
ana brought down 40,000 cases of salmon.
The Harvester was to have followed her
on the 20th inst. and the James A. Bor
land was in port.
The United States tug Unadilla broke
down on her way to Mare Island last
Friday. The steamer Monticello picked
her up and towed her to the Mare Isiand
lighthouse, where a Government vessel
took her in tow. A subscription was col
lected among the passengers of the Una
dilla to pay the Monticello for towing
them in.
"Jake" Palmer, the Southern Pacific's
spotter, is still at work on the Vailcjo op
position boats. Every day he haunts
Washington-street wharf", and every ounce
of freig;it that goes aboard the Sunol he
keeps track of. Then he reports to Agent
K. A. White, and the latter -ends out his
assistants to the shippers and attempts to
induce them to send their ireiirht by an
old tub called the Herald. In the case of
passengers a list of all business men and
their relatives is said to be kept for use
when the opposition is crashed out.
"The opposition will never be crushed
out," saia A. E. Pryor of Piper, Aden,
Goodall <t Co. yesterday. The Southern
Pacific may at once understand that never
again will the fare to Vallejo be more than
50 cents. Even at 2a cents a steamer will
pay, and there will always be one running
from San Francisco. Our fare is 10 cents
each way, but then we were forced into it,
and I'll swear we'll stay with that fare
longer than the monopoly will keep to its
$1 rate."
The British ship Ross Shire, Captain
Baxter, arrived from Sydney yesterday

BROKE THE ENGAGEMENT.
Why Ycung Sam Price and
Sarah Mills Got Into
Litigation.
He Claims That After J ; !ting Him
She Refused to Rtturn $180
of His Money.
The reason why Sarah Mills broke her
engagement to bam Price did not develop
in the suit that was tried in Justice Car
roll's court yesterday, but the troubles
that resulted from the severed relations
did and they furnished amusement for a
large number of people who filled the
courtroom. It appeared that two days
before the time set for the weddine, when
iven the invitations were out, Miss Miiis
had suddenly broken off the match ana
returned tlie engagement rin^, a pair of
earrings and (120 belonging to Price and
told him that their acquaintanc e must
ce.ise.
The young couple had even gone so far
as to purchase the furniture that was to
urace their little flat, and Price was nat
urally grieved that the girl of his heart
should suddenly throw him aside, par-
ticularly as there was no explanation
forthcoming as to the why.
He brought snit for $180, which he
claims he gave into the keeping of Miss
Milla, in addition to the $120 she returned
to him. It developed in the evidence that
one night while Trice was calling on his
I fiancee he stayed rather late, and when he
was ready to leave she told him that it
was not "safe to take his money home and
that he left her a purse containing Jll.'O,
which was deposited in her name in the
Hibernia Bank. This was the money she
returned, and she swore positively that
she had never received another cent from
Price, and her friends and witnesses,
araonjr them "White Hat" McCarthy,
craned their necks to see what effect this
statement would have on the Justice. She
stated, moreover, that the furniture was
paid for out of Her own personal funds and
no one else's.
Price swore just as positively that he
had Â«iven her $300 in ail and that he had
helned to buy the furniture. Mis<Â» Mills'
trrandfather. who was called, tangled mat
tors still further by testifying that he had
paid the money for the furniture out of
his own pocket, and the plaintiffs attor
ney, George Perry, asked for a continu
ance to permit hiri} to bring the furniture
dealer into court to tell just who did pay
for the goods.
THE STEPLADDER CASE.
Charlie King's 1 all Was Accidental
and McCarthy Is Discharged.
The preliminary examination of Charles
McCarthy, an barkeeper, on the charge
of assault to do grievous bodily harm, was
hold before Judge Joachimsen yesterday
afternoon and the case was dismissed.
Several weeks ago Charlie King, a Chi
nese, was standing on top of a stepladder
cleaning the windows in the Auditorium
saloon on Powell street, when McCarthy
cither accidentally or by design knocked
over the ladder and the Chinese fell to the
sidewalk, striking on the back of his head
and fracturing ins skull. His life was de
spaired of for some time, but he finally
recovered.
McCarthy claimed that he stumbled
against the ladder accidentally, and none
of the witnesses yesterday would testify to
the contrary.

MODEL OF FLYING -MACHINE INVENTED BY DR. C A. SMITH OF SAN FRANCISCO.
o U looks just like the business end of a rocket. It has a conical point, a round
body and at the rear end a brass fan whirrs lustily every time a live vrire i.< hitched on
to the electric motor in the interior of the concern. Two wings, like those of a beetle,
rise and fall from the lop of the cylinder, and a few small windows and three rudders
make up the latest of flying machines. i
Will wort? There is no doubt of it, say the inventors, and they point proudly to
the model as it rests on two stools in a shop on Market street. The model is built of
rinc, aluminum was not available in time, and to serve as a propellor one of those
brass electric fans, a contrivance like a four-bladed ship's wheel, has been attached to
, the main shaft. Inside is an electric motor of one-eighth of one horsepower and that
js calculated to drive the propelling wheel at the rate of 1500 revolutions a minute.
At e o very 100 revolutions of the screw the two wings rise from the sides of the cylinder,
stretch themselves for a second like the wings of a bird in full flight and then return
again to the sides of the machine. In full career these will make between fifteeu and
HAS DUPED MANY
SILLY WOMEN,
Wily Lottery Game Played
by a Sleek China
man.
PEDDLES HIS TICKETS.
And the First Time He Always
Makes His Customers
Win.
INDUCES THEM TO STAKE MORE
"When a Round Sum Is Given Him
the Persuasive Mongolian Is
Seen No More.
A number of ladies in the Western Ad
dition are regretting the disappearance of
8 eleek persuasive Chinaman, who has
been a house-to-house visitor in that part
of town lately. They are al*o bewailing
the disappearance of round, substantial
oolJars, which the Chinaman carried
away with him, under the pretext of in
resting them in a lottery which was a
'dead sure thinj^"
The defrauded ladies know nothing
about playing a Jottery. They say that
they never could have been induced to
part with their substance to a mere coolie.
The missing Chinaman looked like an
attache to Li Hang Chang's suite, at the
very least, and his manners were as per-
Buasfre and courtly as his dress was costly
an*! magnificent.
If the ladies with who se dollars he has
pot avray had known anything about
Chinese lottery gambling they would
easily have detected that the persuasive
Chinaman was one o' the most unblush
ing fakeis that ever handled lottery tick
ets, but they took his bomis tickets in good
iniih and wailed for the fortune which
never came. Ketter-informed friends are
row pointing out to them that the bona
lide Chinese lottery dealer puts the name
of the company, the date and the amount
inveÂ«(ed at the side of the ticket, whereas
the Chinarran who has been beguiling the
Western Addition has only defaced his
tickets with an unintellieible scrawl,
which is neither Chinese nor English.
The faking Chinaman has made no
pretensf at peddling vegetables or selling
notions in order to introduce himself, but
has walked boldly op to the front doors
and, ringing the bell in a lordly manner,
has asked, with a sweet and persuasive
smile, if he might be permitted to sell the
Jfldy a lottery ticket. As a rule the lady
lias replied in the negative in which case
John has made his adieux graoefully and
Jias bobbed up serenely the next day
more bland than ever and more certain of
having a dead sure thing in lottery
0 tickets.
The price he asked has been $1 90, but^
' a 10-cent piece was not scorned by the
I wily Chinaman. When sums of over $1
i were invested in his tickets he- never came
'. back, but the customers for 10-cent and
; two-bit tickets were quite touched by the
i fidelity with which John came back next
I day with their money doubled and trebled.
"How much more money you could
| have made if you had put more in," he
â  has been in the habit of remarking pen
' sively as he counted out three times the
| amount of coin, and then repeated again
what a sure thing hiÂ« lottery was. Struck
by this argument, as well as by the hon
esty and uprightness of John's dealings,
people have in a number of instances been
J induced to give him several dollars. They
I waited for him to come back next day and
line their pocketbooks with coin, and they
are waiting still.
A lady who lives on Lea^enworth street
said yesterday: "Yes, we hayÂ»Â» been vie-
I timized by that Chinaman. Of course I
don't want to give our names; you can
just write down that we were three foolish,
j silly women. We might have known how
i it would end, but the man used to come
' day after day, begging us to buy tickets.
| He said he had a certain way of marking
I the numbers, which was Btire to win, and
; promised to give the money back if we
were unsuccesstul. Ono day, to get rid of
him, my sister gave him 10 cents, and the
1 next day he brought her back 30 cents."
"That was the day we all went into the
â  thing," said the sister mournfully. "He
i said that trie lOcents had been trebled and
that if we would give him $5 he could
bring us back $00, and he vowed that if the
numbers were not successful he would
bring back the money. We had saved %'â ',
\ for opera tickets and gave it to him, and
I that was the end of the money and the
j Chinaman."
Carl Erickson's Flying-Machine, Which Is to Be Shown at the Mechanics' Fair.
The Mechanics' Institute, at a meeting last evening, on motion of P. J. Healy, announced that $1000 -would be awarded to
the successful competitor at a matcb between airmotors during the fair. Carl Erickson, who was present, was introduced to the
members by Mr. Healy, and he stated he was ready to make the trip to Sacramento as announced, but 'owing to the refusal of
Mayors Sutro and Davie to accompany him he would, in deference to the wishes of the board, postpone his flight until others
could compete with him. Mr. Lindsey of the Smithsonian Institution, Washineton, has been written to and a liberal offer made
him. In the engraving here presented the various parts are designated as follows: Aâ Balloon, specially constructed silk- hydro
gen gas. Bâ Wings, aluminum. Câ Cylinder, containing the mechanism that governs the flight of the machine" electricity the
motive power. D-Propeller, aluminum, so constructed that the speed is regulated entirely by the revolutions of the propeller
P:-Steering apparatus. F-Car, carrying twelve passengers; constructed of aluminum and windows of prepared pane/ G-
Kegulators, to regulate the upward and downward flight.
THE SAN FRAXCIRCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1896.
twenty strokes a minute, and borne onward by wing and screw the machine is expected |
to make between 75 and 100 miles an hour.
Figure? so far make up the principal portion of the description of the machine, I
and from the result? figured out the inventors draw much satisfaction. In leneth the !
cylinder will be sixty feet, and the cone, which forms the forward end, forty-five feet, j
making a total length of 105 feet. It â¢rill be thirty-nine feet in diameter, and will
have a capacity of 89,593 cubic feet of hydrogen. Hydrogen at the earth's surface has
| a lifting power of seventy pounds to the 1000 cubic feet, which makes the lifting,power
i of the eas inclosed in the macnine something near tfJ.'iO pounds.
! 4 Aluminum will be the metal used in the big airship. In all there will be 1G.546
j square feet ol sheet aluminum used, and this weighs one pound to sixteen square feet, j
!or a total of 1053 pounds. Then there will be an aluminum engine, braces to stiffen ,'
j the various parts and incidentals to bring the weight up to slightly over 2000 pounds.
This gives a lifting power of about 4100 pounds without the use of either wings or screw.
TWO COMPANIES WEAKEN
The British American and West
ern Assurance Grow
Economical. .
They Consolidate Their Pacific Coast
Business With the Denver
Office.
Ftill another change came 33 r esterday in
the fire insurance business of this City
that is in line with the policy of economy
and retrenchment quite recently intro
duced on '.he I';iciiic Coast When it was
announced on the street the news passed
quickly among insurance men, for they
are each and every one interested in in
novatius in any office, sir.cc these things
affect the general business and indicate an
entirely new trend of affairs.
It was told that two important fire in
surance companies â the British-American
and Western Assurance companies, both
of Toronto, Canadaâ had decided to place
their const business under the jurisdiction
of H. T. Lamey, the companies' general
manager at Denver, Colo., for the "inter
mountain division." This meant that the
Pacific (oast business is to be subordinate
to the Denver office. Mr. Lamey is ex
pected to arrive here to-day, and "until he
announces himself there is no certainty
regarding the change.
T. c two insurance companies have
jointly maintained a large and handsome
office at \L\ California street, with H. If.
Grant and Charies A. Stuart general man
agers for the coast. Their City agents
have been Davis & Watson, on California
street.
Mr. Grant said that the chance had
taken nlace yesterday, and that Mr. Lamey
was on his way to San Francisco to carry
it into effect. The change was made for
economy's sake, and in his opinion might
either result in the consolidation ol the
two divisions, or Lamey might take charge
of the local ofiire. On the street, it was
stated that the San Francisco general
oflice would be abolished and that the
City agents would look after local busi
ness on a commission basis.
Up to the present Mr. Grant reported to
the nome oflice in Toronto and received
all reports from agents in California and
the Pacific Coast generally. In future the
agents must transact business with the
intermountain office.
_ This is on the same line of policy estab
lished by the Continental Insurance Com
pany, which withdrew its general coast
office from San Francisco and thus saved
expenses of a larire staff of clerks, etc. The
next company to fall in line was the Fire
Association of Philadelphia. The British-
American has asset! of $1,180,000, tlio
We- tern $1,651429, and both did a fair
business on this coast.
If all the tobacco smoked in the British
Empire last year were rolled into rope an
inch in diameter it would form a xnake
like roll, which, following the line of the
equator, wculd go thirty times round the
earth.
In the forward end, just where the under side of the cone merges into the cylinder,
the pilot-house is situated, and from it is controlled the three rudders at the rear end.
One of these is a big plane set horizontally and destined to control the elevation ; the
others are vertical planes which will drive the machine to tne right or left. The
wings can be made to remain outspread or folded at the desire of the helmsman, and
arrangements will be made to have the bird-like engine balanced to a nicely.
Its flight, say the inventor?, will be swift and even, like the swoop of -an eagle or
the steady course of a bird of prey. It will soar at a height of from one to three miles,
and will have a grappling-hook to stay its speed when it becomes necessary to alight
and it dives down toward the earth.
A working model, that is so far as the mechanical part is concerned, will be on
exhibition in the Mechanics' Pavilion. The model has just been finished. Its Jirst
long flight will be to New York, and the inventors say that forty hours after it spreads
its wings over the Golden Gate it will alight under the shadow of the Statue of Liberty.
TRYING TO EVEN
UP ON THE DEAD,
Another Scheme to Aug
ment the Railroad's
Revenue.
CARRYING OF CORPSES.
It Will Be Taken Out of the
Hands of thÂ£ Express
Company.
LOWER CHARGES TO BE MADE.
The New Order of Things to Be Car
ried Into Effect To-Day on the
Pacific System.
Having failed in its efforts to add a few
odd dimes and quarters to its revenue by
imposing a transportation tax on bicycles
to near-by places, the Southern Pacific
has now turned its attention to corpses,
thus avoiding all danger of organized re
sistance to its demands and possible po
litical antagonisms.
About five years ago an agreement was
entered into with Wells, Fargo & Co.,
whereby the business of transporting
corpses was relegated entirely to the ex
press company, all agents o* the Southern
Pacific Corrpany being instructed as fol
lows :
"Agents must refer persons applying
for corpse transportation by passenger
train to local points to the agents of Wells,
Fargo it Co. 's express."
Under this arrangement the express
company charged two first-class fares for
each corpse, but no oorpse was carried for
a less charge than |6, and if a person de
sired to accompany the remains another
ticket had to be purchased by the passen
ger. This gave the corpse-carrying mo
nopoly a handsome profit, as its space cost
it no more for corpses than it did for ordi
nary baggage, though somewhat more
care, it was true, had to be exercised in
the handling of these "temples of de
parted souls."
Looking about for some source of in
creasing its revenue, the bicycle tax was
i first hit upon, but "the quick" were too
| much for the corporation, so it turned to
the dead to secureali the tariff would bear.
After due consultation and considera
tion it was resolved a few dai-s ago to re
scind the instructions regarding the trans
portation of corpses and to terminate tie
| agreement on the same matter with the
| express company. The circular convey-
I ing the instructions to agents regarding
the new order of things reads in part as
follows:
1 "Commencing September 1, 1896, we will
resume the carriage of corpses. The
charge for transportation of same, chil
dren or adults, in baggage-car between
any two points on the Pacific system, will
be one lowest first-class fare. Minimum
rate will be $1 50. A passenger holding a
proper ticket must accompany the re
mains: otherwise thpy must be handled
by Wells, Fargo <fc Cos. Express."
By this arrangemont all the big profits
heretofore made by the express company
will revert to the railroad company and at
the same time the expense of transporting
bodies will be reduced, in some cases to a
considerable degree.
Where the express company's minimum
charse was $5 that of the railroad com
pany is but $1 50, and when it is desired to
have a person accompany the remains,
there is no extra charge, as was ft case
under the system of the express company.
DEADLY COLLISION.
Xetcgpaper Train Hunt Into a Freight
With Terrible Jtesults.
ORANGE, Mass., Aug. 31. â A newspaper
train and a freight collided near here on
the Fitchburg Railroad about 5 o'clock
this morning, and Engineer William
Clements wni instantly killed and Fire
man George W. Fowler received injuries
which will prove fatal. One brakeman
was also badly cut and bruised.
The freight train had broken in two and
before the separated parts could be picked
up the passenger train struck it and
plowed through twelve cars, reducing
them to kind line wood and entailing a
money loss of $50,000. Engineer Clem
ent* was thrown backward fifty feet and
wedged between two cars, and it took a
long time to get his body out of the ruins.
The road was blocked for eight hours. A
dense fog was undoubtedly a great factor
in the wreck.
JtabieM J-'rotn a Skunk Bite.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Aug. 81.â A special
to the Mornine News from St. Augustine,
Fla., says: Allen Miller, residing at Moul
trie settlement near here, was bitten by a
skunk on Wednesday and at once gave
signs of hydrophobia.
Before he was secured he badly bit his
stepson anct ran through the woods bit
ing trees and everything coming in his
way.
He was tied to his bed, and to-day in a
paroxysm broke the lashing arid escaped
to the woods, severely biting two of his
keeper?, one dangerously.
Application was made to Judge Cooper
here to-nicht for the Sheriff and a posse to
capture Miller, who is a raving maniac.

IS ARRESTED.
The Young Broker Booked
on the Charge of
Forgery.
PREPARING TOR FLIGHT
Found in a Seventh-Street Lodg
ing-House Under the Name
of John Miller.
HE DOES NOT DENY HIS GUILT
Spejit All the Money Upon His Friends,
Who, He Says, Have Now
Turned Against Him.
Norman Schuller, the young broker who
has been for several weeks wanted for
forgery, was arrested yesterday morning
in the San Rafael lodging-house, Seventh
and Jessie streets, by Private Detective
etiilwell.aud taken to the City Prison.
The particular charge of forgery for
Norman Schnllcr, the Young lirokcr Who Was Arrested Yesterday on a
Charge of 1 orgery.
which Schullerhas been arrested is for ne
gotiating a forced note for $5000 with
o Attorney John C. Hushes, Mills building.
o The note was dated May- 6, payable in
three months, and purported to be signed
by D. B. Murphy of Ban Jose and indorsed
by his brother, P. W. Murphy, and his
sister, Mrs. R. T. Carroll. Hughes dis
counted the note and did not discover the
forgery until July 20. He thai day called
Â° "fecholler to account for presenting the
forged note to him, but Scb,uller persisted
that the note was good.
o Schuller, to back up his assertion, agreed
<* to go to San Jo-e with Hushes to satisfy
o him that the signatures were all ri<r'jt.
They crossed the bay together that after
noon, but Schuller gave Hughes the slip
niter leaving the boat, and since then the
detectives have been looking for him.
.- 'ill well learned a fear days a 1:0 that a
man answering Schuller's description had
been frequenting saloons on Seventh
street, and as Nellie Lenahan, a young
Jady to whom Schuller had been paying
his addresses, was living with her aunt at
Â°333 Harriet street, he suspected that Bchnl
. ler was the man seen in the saloons. He
learned that the man was known as John
Miller and yesterday morning he found
frrat Miller had room 29 in the San Rafael
lodging-house.
The defective went directly to the room
end finding the door unlocked entered.
Miller, whom he at once recognized as
Hchuller, was busily packing his valise,
nnefhewas considerably surprised to see
the detective. Schuller said he was pre
paring to leave the City by the afternoon's
steamer lor Vallejo. From there he in
tended to go to Georgetown and then
strike out for the mines, where he hopÂ»d
to remain for several years at least in
safety.
in a bureau drawer in his room were

found a woman's hat dress, gloves and
heavy veil, which he said belonged to a
lady friend, but the detective believed
they were used by Schuller to masquerade
about the neigh do r hood at night.
On the way to the prison Schuller gave
Stiliwell a gold watch, requesting him to
send it to Misa Lenahan, to whom he said
it belongs. Only 15 cents were found in
his pocket when searched at the prison,
lie said he had expected to receive money
from his father.
Schuller, when spoken to in the prison,
did not feel at all disinclined to unburden
his mind. He said he felt his position
very keenly, and it" he had wronged his
friend Hughes he was prepared to suffer
the consequences.
"If I had got away," he said, "I would
have made it my business to work hard to
earn enough money to pay HuphesLack,
but that is at an end now. 1 had spent
my money recklessly among my male
friends and being short of funds I had to
raise more somehow. These men that I
have led an-i cloihed have now turned
against me, but such is the ingratitude of
this world.
"It is false that I spent my money
among fast women. 1 hate the sex.
There is only one young lady I have any
regard lor and 'Ac is a pure, virtuous trirl
"I have spent my time since July 20 in
this City and in Oakland. Why itneed
not have been difficult to find me, as
nearly eveVy night 1 was in the City Hall
and spent ft "lot of money in saioons on
Market street."
It is said that Scbuller's forgeries will
aggregate $1:2,000.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1896.
CABLE CARS BY
16-HORSEPOWER,
Interrupted Traffic on the
Powell-Street Sys
tem.
ENTAIL TEN DAYS' DELAY
An Accident to the Big Shaft on
the Main Central Wind
ing-Wheel.
IT WAS A VERY BAD BREAK
A Large Number of Passengers Incon
venienced by the Stalling
of the Cars.
The Powell-?treet system of cable-car 3
suspended business yesterday morning.
It was not one of those commercial sus
pensions recorded by Braastreets, but the
absolute stoppage of ihe rollins stock
along the lines of Jackson, Powell and
Sacramento streets. It was not that Mr.
Vining's company is "broke," but rather
that a "break" occurred to clojf the
wheels of transportation.
The entire system is centered at the
Washington and Mason streets power
bouse, where six "winders" or wheels
twenty feet in diameter receive the cables
and disburse them.
As Superintendent Skinner pats it,
"These are tigure-S wheels. The cables
come in, pa?s over one wheel, then
under the other and come back and go
under the first one, making a complete
figure 8."
There are three sets of these wheels, and
the trounle yesterday occurred with the
rear one of the middle set. The eieven
inch steel shaft running through the rear
wheels like an axle snapped off short, and
but for the hold the three iront wheels
had of tLe cables the cars of the company
on the different elevations throughout
their course woula have put in a inos>t
territic run to the level, no doubt resulting
in much injury and death.
There is no telling what caused the
breakage of the shaft. It may have been
the crystalization of the metal, or that a
Haw caused the rupture. This will be de
veloped later on, when the broken parts
will have been removed for examination.
In the meantime the Union Iron Works
have start eel in making a new shaft and
even by working dou We shifts, night and
day, Chief En-ieecr Charles Kaiirhan be
lieves that the system will not be ready
for opera uou in less than ten days.
When tbÂ« % shaft broke yesterday there
were twenty-nine cars running on Jack
son street, twelve on Powell street and
twenty-eight on Sacramento s-trc-t. These
were mostly at the foot of the different
grades and not until midnight were they
hauled back. \o the carahopa by v team of
sixteen horses.
The breakage will not interfere with the
running oi Uie Cliff House cars from Cen
tral avenue, and until the line resumes
operation the company will run cars to
the i-ark every fifteen minutes.
The greatest inconvenience suffered by
the public on account of yesterday's breaK
will bo ielt by those residents on West
Jackson street* ana l'acilic avenue. The
North Beach passengers still have access
to their homed by way of the Third and
Kearney streets electric-cars.
There will also be some I.jO conductors
and gripmen lelt without employment for
two weeks-
CAPTURE OF FISH NETS,
Deputy Commissioner Davis Sur
prised the Fishermen of
Rio Vista.
S:x Laree Nets and Two Boats Cdd
fiscatedâOregon Deer Hides Seized
in This City.
Deputy J. H. Davis of the l'ish Com
mission made a very successful capture of
fishing nets and boats last Bandar morn
in? near Rio Vista. Secretary Fletcher
of the commission received a letter yes
terday from Davis, which stated that on
Sunday morning, while the launch Hust
ler was steaming along the Sacramento
River, near Rio Vista, be spied two fish
ing boat?, the occupants of which made
their escape in the tules when tiey paw
ihe launch steaming toward them. The
boats captured had Elliott's taps on tliem,
and the deputy was greatly surprised when
he discovered t is fact. Last year Elliott,
who resides at Rio Vista, made a special
visit to the Fish Commissioner's rooms,
in the Flood building, where ha made ail
urgent request for the appointment of a
man named Kalber of Rio Vi3ta as a
Deputy fr'ish Commissioner. Eliioit said
that the laws were being grossly violated
in the vicinity of. Rio Vista, and that if
Kalber were appointed an officer of the
commission several arrests would certainly
result.
Tbe commissioners did not follow
Elliott's advice, but instead they detailed
a deputy from this City to look after the
tran?gresFor.Â« of the law in the neichbor
hood of Rio ViÂ«ta and as a result several
nets were captured.
Secretary Fletcher is of the opinion that
if the Commissioners had appointed
Kaiber a deputy Elliot would have a very
good opportunity of catching salmon
during times when their capture by means
ot nets is prohibited.
As Deputy Davis and his crew were on
their way down the river to Collinsville
withtbe'two boats ana nets tney seized
near Rio Vista they picked up a third net
which the owner* left behind in the river
as Boon as they discerned danger in sight.
The confiscated property was given in
change of the Justice of the Peace at Col
iinsville to be held as evidence.
On Monday morning Davis made an
other capture of three set nets in Suisun
Bay which were anchored with railroad
iron. These were also turned over to the
proper authorities. The Fish Commis
sioners are very proud of having such a
fearless and Industrious officer as Davis
unquestionably is in their employ, and as
he understands the language of the fisher
men who ply their vocation on the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin rivers it is expect
ed ttiat many seizures of nets will be re
ported this year.
Deputy Al Wilson returned on Sunday
evening from Rio Vista with four striped
bass which were intended for the fish ex
hibit at the Pavilion. The largest of the
tish, a twelve-pound bass, died on the
journey down, but the others were safely
tanked at the Pavilion. As the striped
bass is a most difficult fish to keep in
captivity the commissioners are hoping
that those now on exhibition will live
until the fair is over.
A deputy of the commission seized five
large bales of deer hides laÂ«t week which
were shipped from Coos Bay, Or., to a
commission-house ia this City. The skins
are of the variety commonly known as the
! mule deer, an animal which is fast disap
pearing irom sight because of the ruthless
slaughter which is being waged on them
by professional hunters.
MR. ESTEE'S WORDS.
"The Examiner" Reproved for Trying 1 to Warp Them From
Their True Meaning.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: In Sunday's Examiner I find the
following statement reported to have been made by me in my speech at the Audito
rium on .Saturday evening last:
"That in this country wealth is kinfj in peace, and in war."
I did not make that statement either in letter or in spirit. What I did say, and
what a copy of my speech which the Examiner had in its possession will disclose, is
the following:
"The Debt-paying Power of This Nation."
All over the world every producer is looking ior a market for his products. Every
human being is looking for something to do. Commercial and financial success is the
highest achievement of this age. And so we must have protection or we will have
cheap labor. Cheap labor is never intellieent labor, and all Americans must be
intelligent or tins Republic cannot stand. This is the price we pay for liberty. Who
can oDject to it?
The strength of a nation in peace and in war is no longer measured by the num
bers of its soldiers. Its debt-payine power is its strength. Wealth is king in peace
and in war. During Mr. Harrison's administration of four years, and immediately
preceding Mr. Cleveland's, we paid on the principal of the National indebtedness two
hundred and thirty-six millions of dollars. Daring the tir>t three years of Mr. Cleve
land's administration the National indebtedness was increased two hundred and sixty
two millions of dollars. This was not an accident." * * *
That is what I said and all I said relative to the power of wealth. The context
indicates that the use of the expression so objected to by the Examiner does not relate
to the point which that journal is striving to make and no intelligent, fair or truthful
criticism of my Epeech could possibly sustain the position taken by that paper.
What T said in words and in spirit was that iv modern times it was the wealth of
a nation and not the number of its soldiers that gave it strength, and none but the
most unfair and untruthful partisan criticism could construe it in any other light.
Yours, M. M. Estke.

thrown violently to the ground. Bottom ly
was badly cut on the head, and Foster is
at the Receiving Hospital unconscious
from concussion of the brain.
The Lot IVn<Â» Mortgaged.
J. A. Miller, 960 Mission street, swore to a 1
complaint yesterday charging M. W. Connor
with obtaining" money by false pretenses.
Miller stated that Connor induced him to buy
Riot in the T.Hkeview Tract.' which, lie Mid,
was unencumbered, and in exchange ho Rave
Connor n. promissory note for $(17 00, a book
case worth (50 and a hatrack worth (90. He
declares that he afterward found the lot was
mortgaged to its full value.
The Bishop of Bedford avers that East
Jjomton district contains a population of a
million and a half, nearly all poor. From
this statement some idea will be had of
iho vastness of the work the clergy aro
called upon to perform. The difficulty of
raising funds for so great a work, is very
great.
ESTEE CALLS IT
A DIRTY METHOD,
Indignant at the Perver
sion of His Recent
Speech. .
IS WORSE THAN A LIE
Had Said That Labor Is This
Country's Only Source
of Wealth.
WAS MALICIOUSLY MISQUOTED
Explains What He Did Siy and How
"The Examiner" Segregated
His Words.
Morris M. Estee is wrath at the way the
Examiner has perverted the meaning of
his recent public speech by singling out,
changing and laying btress upon a partic
ular expression calculated iv its altered
form to mislead the public and injure the
cause of Republicanism.
He characterizes the method employed
by the Examiner as the most dirty,
puerile thing of its kind ever heard of in
partisan politics; worse than a lie, because
it tells a very little truth without the
context in order to present a very big lie
and deceive the public.
Mr. Estee has sent for publication a
communication explanatory of what he
actually did say a :<J what h<* meant.
Asked last night if he had anything to
say in addition to what appeared in this
letter, he said:
"Only thisâ that the whole tenor of my
speech was, so far as protection went to
show it, that in a free country we must
elevate Jabor; and we must elevate labor
in America, because the laborers must be
more intelligent than in any other coun
try, and because labor is our only source
of wealth. â 
"In my speech 1 led up to this subject
by saying that 'labor is our only capital.'
I then said, 'The strength of a nation in
peace or in war is no longer measured by
the number of its soldiers. Its debt-pay ing
power is its strength, that is, its power to
earn, to accumulate.
"And i said we Could have no debt-pay
ing power except from well-protected
labor. I did follow the preceding expres
sion by saying, 'Wealth is k iti in peace
and in war,' but I immediately added
that under Harrison's administration we
had paid $ 236,000,000 of the National debt;
I thai under Cleveland's we hud run in debt
'â  100,000; thus illustrating the thcusht
that under one administration we had
protection, we accumulated wealth, the
people were prosperous and the Nation
great, and under the other the people
were not prosperous, the Nation ran in
debt and thus was incapable of defense in
war or of business success in peace."
Mr. Estee then went on to say that the
thought of the context of that garbled and
maliciously distorted sentence must be
clear to every intelligent mind. "No
listener at my meeting," he added, "mis
understood me, and they hea/tily ap
plauded the sentiment.
"I would not change either the thought
or the expression of that speech if I
, could."

McCALL'S STOLEN
CROWN OF THORNS.
: Massachusetts' Eloquent
Congressman Will
Speak To-Night.
REASON TO THE FRONT.
National Congressional Commit
teeman Apsley Will Ad
dress the Meeting.
THEIR WORK IN COLORADO.
They Bearded the Lion in Hs Den
and Held Overflow Meetings in
Two Places There.
Congressman S. W. McCall of Massa
chusetts and L. D. Apsley of the same
State, vice-chairman of the Republican
National Congressional Committee, will
speak on the issues oi the campaign this
evening at the Auditorium, corner of
Eddy and Jones streets.
Congressman McCall has achieved great
reputation as a speaker. He represents
the Eighth District of Massachusetts, in
Tvliich Harvard College is situated, ana is
the originator of the expression, "press
ing a crown of thorns upon the brow of
tabor," which expression was stolen by
Bryan, and used by him with great eclat
at Chicago.
Mr. McCall is a forceful and logical
Bpeaker, and has but few equals in the
â United states. He and Mr. Apsley
j "bearded the silver lion in his den. and had
overflow meetings in Colorado Springs
mi i Colorado City, at which they were
granted not only respectful attention, but
liberal applause. This arose frutn the
fact, that more than one half of both
audiences were Republicans and snpport
â¢ ers ; oi McKinley and protection to Ameri
can labor.
The meeting to-ni?ht will be held under
â¢ of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee. Geori_-e A. Knight will
le. The gallery will be reserved for
i< s ;ind Their escorts.
i be executive committee of the National
o Republican Leacue will meet this evening
pi Uifijr headquarters. Pioneer building*
1' -mess of importance will be transacted
ai d all the members are requested to
- attend.
Tiij executive cornmit;ee of the Repub
lican state Central Committee will hold
a meeting at tiie latter end of this week
â¢ r the purpose of filling the vacancy on
tne elect or;il ticket.
Francis A. Ti-^, ox- 1") strict Attorney of j
&fadera County] one of the brightest lavr
:i Central California, was in the City j
He expressed the opinion that j
Madera County would give a majority for !
M< Kin ley and protection. The raisin.
. growers, sheepmen and laborers in thar
part of the country have been impover
isfaed by the Wilson act and tiiey declare !
that they cave had enough of Democratic i
Bnancerlng. A few of the gold-miners in
the' mountains in that county are for free '
coinage of silver, and state astheir reason
that the increase in the number of silver I
dollar- will send gold to a premium, and !
that they would benefit in that way.
That explains the paradox of a gold miner
being in favor of the unlimited coinage of '
silver with gold at a ratio which almost
o doubles the value of silver.
AFRO-AMERICANS.
Enthusiastic Meeting: of Colored
Republicans Who Are for Pro
tection and McKlnley.
The Afro-AmVrican League held a spe
cial meeting last n'gbt in California Hail,
and there was a large attendance, a num
ber of ladies being present. T. B. Morton
presided and Abraham Strother occupied [
the secretary's desk. During the evening
there was distributed to those present
some campaign literature.
President Morton stated that on the |
14th inst. there will be a grand rally of
the Afro-American League in the Wig
wam, when the campaign would be !
opened.
W. B. Henderson, who was the leader of
the San Francisco delegation to the con
gress that met in Los Angeles lately, was
presented, and he gave an account of what
was done there, as has aiready been re
ported by telegraph, tie spoke of some
individuals who sought to prejudice the
3 convention against T. B. Morton, and said
they wanted to have the league not dp
claro for any candidate for the Presidency.
Mr. James of Alameda, who was a dele
gate to the congress; who was called "a
black sheep" because he had the manhood
to stand up as an American citizen and
vote and act as he thought was just, maJe
a short address.
The president made an address in which
he reviewed the acts of a certain element
in the Los Angeles congress which was
designated as the "hoodlum element,"
and then called attention to the fact that
one E. J. Jackson had declared that he
(the speaker) was not a leader of the col
ored votes. In refutation of this aceiisa
'ii)ii he read a document, of which the fol
lowing is a copy:
Pan FHANCisro. Aueust 10, 1891.
Tothr J?i-jivbh'can County Committeeââ (Jentle
.vi.v: Hie colored citizens of the City and
County of San KranciM i> in inass-nu-etinK as
tseinbled at Germania Hall, OHO Bush street on

ean managers. Mr. Morton bu been very en
ergetic in conclliatiiifc the indppendentcoiored
voters, as well us a tew Democratic voter*, and
in consideration oi the above we have selected
him a- a leader among our people. We feel
assured that no man among our people could

After the above selection was made T. B.
Morton requested the citizens to organize a
Republican cJub, which at his request was im
mediately done.
ALLIANCE HOME AGAIN.
The President Denies a Story
About the Trip.
OAKLAND, Cal., Ang. 31.â The Repub
lican Alliance is highly incensed at a dis
paich from Los Angeles published in to
day's Examiner. George P. Morrow, pres
Â° ident of the alliance, who is quoted in the
article as> saying that he was so angry that
be would not go into the pavilion, denies
the statement. The Alliance made a great
run back to Oakland and landed this
morning right on time. They wer* de
lighted with their trip, and intend to pass
resolutions thank ing Conductor Lou Mar
tin for his efforts in making the large party
comfortable.
To-night President Morrow sent the fol
lowing dispatch to F. P. Flint, chairman
of the committee at Loa Angeles:
To-day's Examiner has an article evidently
Inspired by the Herald. Not a word oi truth
â¢â  in it. we were nicely treated. We did not
simply lor n rool time. We did go to help
tin; cause of Republicanism. We believe we
have. Get in and work. We believe in the
ultimate triumph of decency, common-sense
and Jove of one's country. Summed up in oue
word, that is McKinley."

A CHILD HELD FOR RENT
Mrs. .lane I>o\v Will Kcpp Mrs. Flora
Boyce'a Baby Until Mie Pays Her
Hoard Hill.
Some weeks ago Mrs. Flora Royce, an
actress in the People's Palace, placed her
two children with Mrs. Jane Dow, 329
Kansch street. She agreed to pay $18 per
month for their board and lodging. All
went well till a week or two ago, when
Mrs. Rovce fell into arrears to the extent
of $â¢;.
Mrs. Dow had been pressing Mrs. Royce
for the money, and Friday night she went
to her and promised to pay the amount in
a few days. Mrs. Dow refused to board
the children any longer, and against the
protestations of Mrs. Royce kept one of
the children and its clothing as security
for the $G.
Mrs. Royce consulted with her friends,
and they advised her to procure a search
warrant to regain possession of her child.
She appeared before Judge Low yesterday,
but the Judge, after hearnii: her story,
told her he very much regretted he could
not oblige her with a search warrant.
SUNFLOWER'S INVITATION
His Audience Asked to Attend
His Trial in the Police
Court.
I The Alleged Obstructor of the Streets
Addresses a Lirge Open-Air
Meeting.
"I invite you all to come and see a free
i man in a free country tried like a criminal
for exorcising his inalienable right of free
speech."
Thus did Charles D. Sunflower address
: a crowded open-air audience last night on
j Pine street, just below its intersection
with Kearny. The sidewalks were kept
clear, but the middle of the street was
i closely packed. Though applause was fre-
I quent and enthusiasm manifest the throng
i was at least as orderly as the average
| audience in any theater or lecture-hall.
I Now and then a policeman would glance
; at the assemblage from an adjacent street
] corner, but the meeting was not disturbed
' nor the speaker in any way molested by
I the minions of the law.
"Yes, gentlemen," went on Sunflower.
; "lam a prisoner at large, so to speak,
simply because I am a Socialist, and be
cause I did what I had a right to do. If !
free speech be a crime, then I am a crim- j
inal. and a self-confessed one; but if Mich
be the case, then let all lovers of freedom I
Â«eek some other land where tr If can ue
free in fact as well as in name. Come on
Thursday, all ot you, and see a free man
i tried for saying what be thought â or
! rather for thinking alone, since 1 was ar
! rested at the 'siJent meeting' last Bator
\ day near the Odd Fellows' hall. Oil that
, this land were truly tree."
Able addresses were also delivered by E.
I. Kingsley, the Socialist nominee * tor :
i Con>;reb3, George Si eed and Mark Leites.
â  The last named speaker took occasion to
dwell at some length upon The Call's im
partial treatment of the recent conflict
; between the Socialists and the police au- i
! thorities.
"I fail to understand the attitude of the j
! other papers," he observed. "The Call
i alone has bandied our late difficulty with
j courtesy and consideration. Its reports of
the various phases of the affair have been
full and accurate, and I have reason and
I authority for 'saying that the Socialist
I Labor party, while not surprised at Thk
Call's dignified and fair treatment, is
j most grateful for it."
Yesterday morning the five Socialists
i arrested on Saturday night came up for
i trial in Judge Conlan's court. The first
i case was that of Sunflower, who de
manded a jury trial. His attorney, Mr.
: Haskell, gave as a reason tor this demand
j the fact that his client feared that if tried
| by the Judge alone he might be acquitted,
; whereas it was desired to appeal tne cases
to the Supreme Court fur final adjudica
tion. The demand was allowed and the
cases continued until Thursday of this
| week.
The campaign committee has made ar
| rangements for meetings every evening
j during each week, as follows: * Sundays,
corner of Market and Dupont and at the
I Pythian Castle; Mondays, corner of Pine
and Kearny streets; Tuesdays and Thurs
days, Sixth and Folsom sire<;i3 and Ninth
and Howard streets; Wednesdays, Fourth
and Jessie streets and at the Turk-street
Temple; Fridays, corner of Franklin and
.fag*- streets; Saturdays, corner of Seventh
and Market streets.
Reports from the various sections
throughout the City and State are must
encouraging. Several thousand sitna
tur^s have been obtained to the petition
asking that the names of the Socialist can
didates be placed on the official ballots,
and the party's prospects seem to be
bright.

Democrat, and Who Delivered a Republican Speech at Lorin
Last Night.
many among the audience beinu ladies.
Addresses were made by Judge William
! Lain Hill. Hon. S. P.Hafl and Town Trus
; tee Martin, whose conversion to McKm
: leyism from the ranks of Democracy was
reported in this morning's Call. The ap
pearance of the now convert upon the
, platform called forth long, loud applause.
At the close of his remarks the hall fairly
rang with cheers.
Trustee Martin gave an eloquent pre
sentation oi his reasons for deserting
Demoiracy and becoming a follower of,
the man of Ohio. He declared that his I
tariff views had not changed, hut added: I
"1 cannot support a party which advo
cates the collection of less revenue than is
necessary to \ny our obligations; that
threatens to discourage and disorganize
our entire monetary system ; that advo
cates the supremacy of mobs and riots,
and that proposes to make our court of
la^t resort a convenient tool to act. in
accordance with every vicious whim or
caprice of our Chief Executive or Con
gress."
Trustee Martin vigorously attacked the
recent course of the Democracy, especially
in the passage of the Wilson bill, and
proceeded to declare against the "free
silver craze."
He declared that free coinage would
make a prolit of $19,000,000 a year for
silver mine owners, giving statistics in
substantiation of his statements.
"I do not concede that there can be any
permanent increase in the price of silver
bullion by the proposed legislation," said
Mr. Martin, "nor is ihere any necessity for
an advance in order that the present silver
mine owners may become the Rothchilds
of the world in a few years."
In conclusion, the sneaker made an
eloquent appeal to his bearers' patriotism,
asking for the support of McKinley in
the^ "battle for freedom from insanity,
socialism and anarchism."

A BURGLAR GETS AWAY.
Schoenau Interprets the Noise,

ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 31.â Officer
Louis Schoenau surprised a burglar at
work last nicht; and though he did not
catch his man, he saved the owner's prop

subsequent identification.
Schoenau was on his beat on Schiller
street, walking toward Railroad avenue
.about 8 o'clock last ni ht, when his atten

residence of John Goldstone. He started
in to investigate by climbing over back
yard fences and found his man. But the
burglar bad heard his movements and cot
away. fa
Schoenau gave chase and fired two shots
after the thief, who passed close to two
young ladies, the Misses Pieiffer.
They scrutinize!! the' fellow and will be

A Memory for Faces.
VAIV A 1 Cal., Aug. 31.-H. K.
iMeld of Paru street, well known on account
of his literary ability, has a retentive
memory for faces that he turned to good
account yesterday afternoon. Twelve
months ago the inhabitants oi that neigh
borhood were much incensed at the inde
cent exhibitions that a man named John
Hall was making of himself en the beach
before the children of that quarter. Three
complaints were sworn against him by E.
A. Allen of 717 Paru street In August of
last year and a fourth by Officer Schoenau
in the next month, but he had flown when
tne arrest came to be made and could not
be located. Yesterday afternoon Hall
happened to strike on his old haunts, and
Mr. field kept him in conversation pend
ing th- arrival of a policeman for whom he
had telephoned. The man turned out to
be Hall and i c was lodged in jail. Hall
will demand a trial by jury.

J. S. STEPHENS' ADDRESS.
Telling Speeches Made at the
Thirty â¢ seventh Dis
trict Club.
"PROTECTION" IS THE SLOGAN.
Graphic Recital of the Atlanta Poli
tician's Plea for Free Coin
age of Pi? Iron.
"There was never a greater American
than James G. Blame; he is recognized
to-day as being the man who was to the
American people what Bismarck is to
Germany and Gladstone is to England."
Such were the introductory words of
Hon. James S. Stephens in his address
delivered before rthe members of the
Thirty-seventh District Republican Club
at Hildebrandt Hail, 430 Hayes street, last
evening.
"And," continued the speaker, 'James j
G. BJaine loved his country. He unoer- j
stood her manifold needs; he knew where !
to find a market for her products, and he j
knew what laws should he framed to place
us in the Lest light befbre the rest of the
civilized world.
"The American people rejected this
noble man for the Presidency and placed
in the executive chair Grover Cleveland,
an owl who has sat on the dried limb of
decadence and hooted calamity from the
morning to the evening of his administra
tion â a man who has oecn rejected by his i
own party and declared to be good for
nothing but fishing for cod or mackerel.
"Yes, and he went in on promises â big
promises, small promises, hoary-headed
promises and promises in the bald-headed
stage. The intention now is to place in the I
seat which he will shortly vacate William I
J. Bryan, who has been on the stump only i
a short time, and yet already has a record j
fur promises that would ti"row Grover's
mt.j the siiade.
"Bryan is not only a promise-maker,
but he is a demagogue, a free-trader, a
Populo-Democrat and the foremost be
liever in the free coinage of silver in the
country. He is a free-silver man, I say,
a free-silver manâ one who is willing to
bring on financial anarchy and consequent
chaos in order |to further his own selfish
aims."
With the remark that he would have I
something further to say on this subject at !
another period in his address the speaker
gave a glowing description of the record of
the Republican party, stating that though
it was conservative yet tne list of reforms
inaugurated under its auministration
would make that ot any other part}- sink
into insignificance in comparison. Alter
a review ot the hnancial policy of the Demo
cratic and Republican parties, the speaker
entered upon the issue between free trade
and protection, which he said is the only
important issue before the people.
"It was free trade," he said, "that shut
up the factories and turned the working
men out of their doors. It was free trade
that brought this country where it is now.
The Democrats know this, and this talk |
about free silver is only a subterfuge lo i
cover the real issue beneath a pile of I
words."
Speaking of the opinions he had heard I
individual Democrats express, the lawyer
said a man told him the other day thut
free trade is a good thing and that miinii- :
facturers. should go to Japan where skilled
labor is cheap in order to manufacture
articles cheaply for the American people, j
â¢Now," he said, "what would the farm- I
ers think of a man who should go to Claus j
Spreckels and tell him that he should not
erect sugar factories in the Salinas Valley
and j,'ive 10,000 farmers employment, but
should go to some other country where
labor is cheap, so that he could sell us all
i cheaper sugar?"
At the conclusion of Stephens' remarks
L. G. Shroeder made a short and fervent
; speech, in which he said the action of the
man who crept behind an umbrella to
avoid a lion formed the precedent of the
i Democrats. All the talk on free silver
,he believed simply a make-believe to
, hide the "abominable failure of free
| traue."
"They had the issue of free trade and
protection in Sweden several years ago
â  and the poor people were for free trade
I because tney believed that tinner protec
i tion flour would be higher. Protection
j won and in three years the country had 37
i per cent more manufactories than they
had before. They were so pleased that
1 they established a protection policy for ten
' years to come."
The speaker then recited with telling ef
fect the argument In favor of the free coin
age of pig iron made by an Atlanta man,
and published in a former issue of The
Call.
E. J. Wolfe then made a few remarks,
after which the following resolution waa
adopted unanimously:
We, the Thirty-seventh District Republican
Club, heartily indorse James Alva Watt and
P. E. McCarthy as County Committeemen
from tueThlriy-scventh District.

Bcyan Has Placed tbe Gold-
Mining Industry in Seri
ous Danger.
HE IS A PURE FREE-TRADER,
Facts, Figures and the Deadly Parallel
All Contribute to Point a
Moral.
There exists a fellow feeling between
men engaged in kindred crafts which is
greatly to their credit, but which some
times leads them to the espousal of causes
not always to ti.e advantage of themselves
or their country. It has been so to some
extent with the gold miners of California.
3 M :.en, in 1593, the closing of the mints of
India to the free and unlimited coinage of
silver caused the price of that metal to fall
so that certain silver mines were closed
down and silver miners thrown out of em
ployment, the gold miners of California
sympathized very strongly with their fel
low-craftsmen of the silver- producing
States and Territories, and many of them
were led to believe that an injustice had
beenÂ«done to silver and the silver miner,
and that free coinage ought to be under
taken by the United .States alone.
There was yet another reason for cham
pioning the cause of the free silver miners.
Some hundreds, and perhaps thousands,
of idle miners flocked to California either
to compete with California gold miners in
their own fields of labor or to be a tax
upon them for assistance while out of
Â° 0 work, and this contributed to the feeling
among California miners that such a
policy ought to be pursued by our Govern J
ment as would tend these silver miners
Lack to work in the silver mines and so
relieve Caiiiom;a miners of this competi
tion or charge upon their incomes.
No one will blame the California gold
miner for looking to his own interest.
That is human, but sometimes there is a
narrow and sometimes a broad way ofcon
pideping self-interest, and it is to abroader
j>elf-inierest that the Republican party
would have the California gold-mincrdirect
his attention. For instance, it is a fact that
the closing down of the silver mines in
1893 did set free a large number of silver
who came to California and either
competed with California gold-miners in
,jold mining or were a charge upon them,
but it is also true that the revival of gold
mining has long since set ail these miners
at work and also found employment for
many more men than have ever before been
employed in mining in the history of the
country. In Colorado, according to a
leading paper of that State and of Denver,
there are now 10 per cent more miners at
work than during the first quarter of 1593.
California maites even a better showing in
this regard than Colorado. According to
statistics furnished by the State Mining
Bureau the number of men ot all colors
encased in all kinds of mining during
Â°1593 94 was 13,107, while during the year
1d94-95 there were 17.550 of white men
alone and 580 Chinese with a number of
camps yet to be heard from. Therefore,
it is plain that t&e revival of gold mining
has already compensated tne miner for
0 any loss sustained by a decline of silver
mini.ng, and so that reason for espousing
the cause of the silver miner no longer
exists.
Nothing could be further from the pur
pose of the Republican party than to be
little the importance of the mining indus
try in America, and especially that of
i mining the precious metals, for there
scorns to be some likelihood that, after all.
tho^e tireless prospectors and hardy
miners,, doggedly digging away in spue of
discouragements, are the men who may
o yej settle tne financial issue by restoring
, lie o.d market ratio between gold and
silver- thioueh an increased production of
gold, and yet there is prevalent among
the people a most exaggerated idea oi the
â magnitude of the mining industry as
'compared with other industries. In 1890,
hen the last, census was being taken,
. "there was mined in the United States gold
to the coining value of $32,845 000 and
silver of the coining value of 170,465,000,
making a total coining value of $103,310,
-000. To produce this metal there were
employed in 4905 mines which were being
worked 57,307 men. In 1892, the last year
of Harrison's administration, there was
"mined in the United States gold to the
' Coinage value of $33,000,000 and silver to
the coining value of 101.000, making a
total coinage value of $115,101,000, and
tais was the largest Output in the history
of the Nation. Therefore an increase in the
"number of men employed in mining the
precious metals proportionate to the in
creased volume ot metal obtained would
place tbe number of miners at work in
1892 (the most prosperous year for mining
in the entire history of tne country) at
63,347.
it 33 no disparagement to the mining of
precious metals to compare that industry
with the ereat manufacturing industry in
this country, or even with certain
branches of it.
There were more wage-earners employed
in the single industry of manufacturing
woolen goods in the United States in 18U0
I than were employed in gold and silver
mining in 1892, when the mining indus
try reached its highest development in the
history of the country and the value of
the woolen product -was greater. The
figures, as taken from the Abstract of the
Eleventh Census, page 157, are as follows:
Employes, 79,351; value of output, $133,
-577,977. . :â¢â¢â â '- â¢, - â  . â¢
In 1&90 there were four-fifths as 'many
manufacturing establishments of one sort
and another in operation in the single
city of San Francisco as there wÂ»,-re gold
mid silver mine-< of all kinds in operation
in the United States, and these factories
employed eight-riinths as many hands and
I paid three-fourths a3 much wages as all
the gold and silver mines in the United
States, thÂ» exact figures (taken from part
11, page 531 of Census Reports Relating to
Manufacturing Industries) arc as follows:
Number of manufacturing places report
ing, 4059; number of employes, 48,440;
I wages paid, $30,979,374.
Compared to the manufacturing indus
tries of the Nation, whose very life Mr.
Bryan and his associates have jeopardized,
the industry of gold and silver mining,
great as it is, assumes almost inaUrnifioani
proportions, as the following comparisons
will show:
Number of jfola and silver mines in opera
tion, 1b00, 4738.
Number of manufacturing establishments,

The foregoing comparisons between the
industry of gold and silver mining and the
manufacturing interests of our country,
while not calculated to belittle the in
dustry of mining for precious metals,
which is very important, is nevertheless
tremendously instructive. Supposing
that the election of Mr. Bryan should re
sult in the passage of a free coinage law
and a marked increase in silver mining,
what would that be to the country com
pared to the wrecking of American manu
facturing industries by the enactment of
free trade-laws, and that Mr. Bryan is a
pure free-trader the following quotations
from his speeches in Congress abundantly
proves. On the 16tb of March, 1592 (page
2355 of the Congressional Record), Mr.
Bryan said:
"I want to say as emphatically as words
can state it that I consider it false in
economy and vicious in policy to attempt
to raise at a higher price in this country
that which we can purchase at a lower
price abroad."
Again, on the 20th of the same month,
Mr. Bryan said :
"I am not at this time complaining of a
revenue tariff. What 1 denounce is a pro
tective tariff, levied primarily and solely
for protection. It is false economy and
the most vicious political principle that
ever cursed this country."
Nothing could be more explicit than
this and, if elected, Mr. Bryan will use all
the power of his administration to put in
effect nis free trade policy as well as his
policy of free silver coinage, and what
though there be a fellow-feeling between
those who mine gold in California and
those who mine silver in Colorado or
Arizona, are not the almost five millions
of toilers in the factories of America
brethren also.
Mr. Bryan is not wanting in any of
those art:tices for getting "next to the
people" which the smoothest of politicians
possess, but his election would be as
disastrous to the minim; indu-try of Cal
ifornia as to the fruit industry or the
manufacturing industry. FuJy GO per
cent of the miners in California are in
teiested directly or indirectly in "pros
pects." Perhaps thousands of them work
down in the valleys during the winter,
but when summer comes they rlock into
the Sierras on prospecting tours. Hun
dreds of others through the min
ing counties are interested in de
veloping individual claims, and almost
all oi these are on a lookout to obtain cap
ital to develop or purchase some of tlie-e
claims, which they themselves cannot de
velop for want of means. Now, the very
capital these men are anxious for and
have been waiting for for years is being
frightened away by this free-silver craze,
and this, too, just as Eastern and other
capital is beginning to be invested in
and loaned upon mining properties; but
no sane man will lend a dollar in gold
when there is a risk that he will be repaid
in a depreciated currency, or tnat an in
dustrial condition will be brought about
which will make it impossible for the bor
rower to repay at all. Tbeae are precisely
the effects now being produced by the
crusade for free silver and free trade now
being waged by the Democratic party.
From IS4S to 1573, inclusive, California
produced an annual average of almost
$38,000,000 in gold, but after 1573 tuere was
a steady decline of mining in this State
until 1893. when ti.e shutting down of
some of the silver mines of the silver
fctates and Territories created a world
hunger for gold that led to a revival of
gold mining everywhere. During these
years tne output Oi gold and silver from
California mines dwindled from $20,000,000
a year to $12,000,000, and the opinion was
generally entertained that California had.
long since seen her best raining days.
The revival of gold mining in this State
began almost immediately after the crash
of 1898, so that by the close ol that year
the gold and silver product for the 3'ear
reached $12,yo'J.!)C8, again of almost $1,000,
-000 over the previous year. For 1894 the
output of gold and silver was $14,220,
-613 44. a gain of nearly $2,225,000 over 1892,
and for 18t>5 the gold and stiver product of
our State reached $15,934,107 39, a gain of
almost four millions over tne product for
1892, and while there are no accurate data
obtainable at this time those conversant
with mining affairs believe that the Cali
fornia output of gold and silver for 1896
will nearly if not quite reach $20,000,000.
Surely California miners have not suffered
by reason of the dosing down of a few of
the poorer paying among the silver mines
of the silver mining States.
Now a greater part of the impetus re
cently given to California gold mining la
because oi the investment of capital which
has come from out>ide of California.
Much of it is borrowed money, and will
California gold miners, by voting for a
depreciated currency, frighten away this
capital just on the threshold of an era ot
great mining development? The great
"mother lode," 120 miles long, has not yet
been half prospected, and oniy a fraction
of the eood prospects hava been worked
at all. If there is to be mining develop
ment there mu9t be capital, and a large
part of this capital has got to be borrowed,
and it cannot be borrowed as long as there
is a danger of the debt being repaid in a de
preciated currency. And it should be re
membered that if the Popocratic party suc
ceeds in carrying out its programme there
will be no such thing as safeguarding capi
tal oy stipulating for payment in ''gold
coin of the United States," for tiie Chicago
platform proposes to have Congress take
away from the people the power to make
private contracts of that kind. The exact
words of the platform are: "We favor
such legislation as will prevent for the
future the demonetization of any kind of
legal-tender money by private contract."
Therefore, the triumph of this free silver,
free trade (but not free contrnct) aggrega
tion would mean the destruction in its
lusty youth of what promises to be an era
01 mining develoDment in California such
aÂ« has not b- en seen since tne days of '49
to 'l>s. Beside-*, if the California gold
miners really wish to aid their brothers
in the silver districts, tuere is no other
way of cloing it so effectually as to safe
cuard in every possible way the invest
ment of capital in the production of pold.
for each ounce of gold that is taken out
of the ground makes room in the mone
tary systems of the world for the circula
tion by its sida of sixieen ounces of silver.
Take that thought with you while you
work.
But a!l this concern manifested for
silver by the Popocraticatrgreeation is the
shallowest pretense. It is a mere beating oi
tom-toms to distract the attention of the
people from the gr^at conspiracy of im
potency which brought upon the country
the crash of 93 and which has kept the
business life of the Nation nailed to the
cross of uncertainty for ranie than tbrea
yt.-a.rs. Every promise made by the De
mocracy four years ago has been violated,
its every prediction has failed of fulfill
ment, and now, in tbe hope of escaping
the drubbing it was and i-s certain to get
in November, that portion <,f the poli
tician 1 * who captured the Democratic man
agement turt-w the party principles to the
wind.s and entered into a conspiracy with
an equally conscienceless clique of poli
t;cian* in control of the People's party.
The purpose of this conspiracy is not pri
marily to secure free coinage or silver, but
four years of office, and to obtain office
there is no prolusion these adventurers
will not make, no prophecy t hey will not
utter, no sophistry they wili not employ,
no prejudice they will not excite, ft <
iu3Sion they will not inflame, and
no nation-destroying spirit of anarchy
that they will not ict loose to ravage their
Country. All, all is chanced in one des
perate effort to gain control of a Nation
whobeailairsareotherwi.se certain to be
committed to the Republican party for a
generation. For the oid Democratic party
of American history even Republicans
cherish respect, though notable to adopt
itÂ« theories of government ; but the states
men of the Democratic party are not in
this unholy aggregation. T:iov have pro
tested acainst n and will vote aguiu-t it.
Nor is tne file of the People's party with
tue movement. They a^so have been do
trayed by their demagogic manipulators.
Principles which Republicans can but
re.L-ard a.-* mistaken, but which were,
nevertheless, adhered to w. ih sincerity,
have been cast away without a pang to
lighten the load for a disgraceful scramble
for uiiice.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1896.
WISE COMES TO
WILLIAMS' RESCUE
His Testimony in the
Chinese Cases Now
Pending.
DEFENDANT IS RETICENT
He Objects to Telling Anything
About His Bank
Account.
ABOUT INSPECTORS' REPORTS.
Difference of Opinion as to How
They Should Be Turned
In.
Collector of the Tort John H. Wise and
Richard S. Williams, ex-Chinese inspector,
occupied the witness-stand in the United
States District Court yesterday. There
JOHN H. WISE, Collector of the Port, on the Stand.
were others, but the evidence offered by
the two named was the principal feature
of the day.
The spectacle of tbe chief Government
officer on the Pacific Coast attempting to
bolster up the cause of a man discharged
from the service for sundry good reasons
and now on trial for extortion, was per
haps never before witnessed in California.
The recital of "Williams' efficiency as an
inspector would probably have been weil
received by the court and jury but for one
unforeseen circumstance.
Three inspectors were called to the
stand, and to a man they swore the Col
lector of the Port was in error. Wise de
clared that prior to six months ago there
was no rule in his office requiring a writ
ten report from inspectors of every case
investigated. They could make oral re
ports if they so desired. In the afternoon
three menâ Lynch, Boiso and Wellerâ
stated on oath that it was the custom of
the Chinese bureau to make written re
ports on every Chinese case. They went
lurther than this In declaring that Wil
liams' reputation for truth, honeatv and
veracity was bad.
The difference of opinion as to facts be
tween Collector Wise and the inspectors
was not the only sensation of the day.
The defendant, Williams, was placed on
the stand, and with charming candor he
denied all the allegations contained in
the four counts". Several days ago he ex
pressed a great desire, end that, too, in
the presence of Collector Wise, to explain
hi 9 big bank account. Yesterday, wnen
Prosecuting Attorney Heniey asked him
to account for $800 deposited on a certain
day in October, 189">, Attorney Mowry en
tered such a clamorous objection that
the point was sustained without argu
ment.
It was brought out in the trial, how
ever, that Wihiunis was very closely re
lated to the ciaÂ»r4 ot persons from whom he
is alleged to have extorted money, iien
le" asked the defendant if he were not a
half-Chine-eâ mat is. if his father was
not a Uelestial and his mother a white
woman. Reluctantly Williams replied in
the affirmative. Some months Jitro the
same question was put to him in Commis
sioner lleacock's court and he denied with
a great show of resentment that such was
the fact. Yesterday the prosecution had
the necessary evidence well in hand, and
there was no attempt to evade the truth.
When court opened yesterday morning
there was the usual crowd in attendance.
The defense made another direct attack
on the cnaracter of Wong Sam. Joha EL
Fairchild, a Cmnatowu guide, John T.
Cusgrovc, wno follows a similar occupa
tion, and Gef Garu, a missionary, testified
that Sam's reputation for truth and hon
esty was very bad. Collector Wise was
then called to the stand. As he passed by
the attorneys he smiled btÃignly on
Coogan and Mowry, gave a curt."good
morning" to Mr. Henley and ignored en
tirely the Special Treasury Agent, Major
Moore.
In addition to the facts already recited
th.c witness said Williams had nothing to
do, so far as i c knew, with tbe landinu oi
eitho-r Wong Ling Cnow or Chin Shee
Huog. Attorney Mowry then endeavored
to bring out the (statement, that during the
time Williams conducted the examination
of the Chinese women cates more were
denied a landing than ever before in the
history of the Chinese bureau.
"I have no doubt," interjected Mr. ilen
ley, "that he returned every woman who
diii not pay him."
This saiiV started a merry war of words,
ar.d in order to quell the disturbance
Judge Morrow suggested that the position
assumed by the defense was somewhat in
consistent. "You undertake to prove,"'
mid hid Honor, "that Williams hud no
authority to land the Chinese. Now you
want to show that he returned or denied a
landing to innumerable Chinese."
After a deal of argument the witness was
finally instructed to answer, whereupon he
j said that he had assigned the investigation
of the Chinese cases to Williams and
Lynch. "In many cases," the Collector
,said, "the reports of the inspectors were
verbally made."
In cross-examination, Mr. Wise said
that frequently many inspectors were en
j-au'ed in the lan lin^ of Chinese, but he
was positire that Williams bad not been
connected with the Wotitt Ling Chow case.
j However, he di i not pretend to know
' whether or not the defendant had induced
any Chinese to believe that he had the
authority to lann the Orientals.
"II Mr. Lvncn testitied that, relative to
the Wong Ling Chow case, Williams in
terviewed the Chinese on board the ship,
would you contradict the statement?' 7
"0h, "n0," was the reply.
This practically concluded the testimony
of Collector Wisp, snd with the introduc
tion of another Chinese witness or two the
deiense rested.
The prosecution then called Chinese In
spectors Lynch, Hoi^e and Weller. They
were asked to state the general reputation
of Williams prior to April 7, and without
exception they pronounced it bad. They
went further than this in declaring that it
was the invariable custom of the inspec
tors to tile written reports on all Chinese
cases investigated. This evidence created
intense excitement, because Collector
Wise had only a short time before sworn
that the custom of written rpports was
oniy established about six months ago.
The prosecution expects to present one
or two more witnesses to-day, nfter which
it is presumed counsel will make argu
ment and then submit the case to the
jury.

CELTIC UNION AT WORK
Over Thirty Societies Have Now
Sent in Their Cre
dentials.
H arty Co-operation Is Urged as the
Essential Element of
Success.
The Celtic Union met last evening at
K. R. B. Kali and perfected an organiza
tion by the election of an executive com
mittee, which, with the officers previotislv
elected, made up the governing board of
the union.
Tbe attendance represented many Irish
societies, and during the evening the
strength of tbe union, which already em
braced about tnirty-rive societies, was
augmented by the addition of the Knights
of the Red Branch, whose credentials were
accepted.
The proceedings were opened with a few
remarks by Colonel T. P. Barry, who has
acted as president of the union during the
preliminaries. Colonel Baary introduced
the permanent president, Jeremiah Dea?y,
who was received with applause and made
a neat speech, counseling co-operation on
the piÂ»rt of nil Irish societies and predict*
ing that much good will come to the Irish
people on the oast from the formation of
the union. The constitution was amend
ed to do away with the ollice of sergeant
at-arms and to provide for an innerguard,
to be nominated monthly by the presi
dent.
'1 lie work of selecting the executive
committee was then begun. Under the
constitution an informal hallot for all
offices must precede a formal ballot and
this made the proceedings long. On the
in formal ballut the following nairn d re
reived votes: Colonel O Byrne, Colonel
Barry, T. Alumi, O. P. Kooney, Dr. Cur
:.i!i. John Oamly, P. 11. Flynn, Jrome

B. Fiamtgau. Chares O'Brien, John C.
Kyan, P. Tammany and J. Broderick.
Several of those who hud been men
tioned withdrew before the formal ballot
whii-h resulted in the selection of the fol
lowing: Colonel O'Byrne, Colonel J'arrv,
Charles O'Brien, Jerome l)eaÂ«y, P. 11.
Flynn, O. P. Kooney and Charles Flan
i;a mi. tiie^e seven leading.
The officen of the union previously
elected are as follows: President, Jere
miah Deasy; vice-president, P. >}. Me-
Qushen; recording secretary, R. J.
O'Reilly; financial secretary, M.Goimau;
treasurer, John Mnlhern.
One purpose of the union is to build a
hall, but plans may not be received
for some little tinie. It is propo-ed to
erect a building worthy of the union,
which includes about all the Irish socie
ties in S.an Francisco.

SCOPE OF THE PUBLICATION.
Demands for the Synopsis of the
New Charter Necessitate a
Second Edition.
Since its organization with forty-seven
members in April, 1894, the Merchants'
Association has made great strides, being
now one of the City's principal commer
cial factors. Any business firm in good
standing is eligible to membership in the
association, each firm having one vote,
though it may De represented at the meet
ings by any or all of its members or by
any employe whom it may designate.
The dues are only $1 a month, and the
advantages of membership considerable.
The official list of members has just been
issued, and from the following table an
idea of the association's rapid growth may
be formed :
Number cf members April 13,1894 47
umber of members .May 3>/, 1&95 'Jl4

The association has just got out a sec
ond edition of its synopsis oi the proposed
n w charter. The edition consists of 10,
-000 copies, and la even now nearly ex
hausted.
A new feature in the work of the or
ganization is the Merchants' Association
Monthly Keview, of which The Call has
received advance sheets. The nrst num
ber will be issued on or about fceptember
L The publication is neat and attractive
in its makeup and interesting in the ruat
tet presented in its columns for perusal.
The scope ol the new recruit in the local
literary army is thus outlined in Us saluta
tory address;
To keep the members of the Merchants' A
ssociation always posted upou its affairs and in
Closer toucn with its work, this .Monthly Re
view is created, The quarterly meetings or
the association are excellent In their way, and
will be continued. Comparatively lew mem
bers, however, attend meetings oi any kind,
but this Review oucÂ« a month will reach all.
Nothing of a personal, political or religious
nature will be admitted to these columns, nor
advertisements of any description. Ii will
contain a monthly suairanry oi the work of the
associationâ accomplished, under way and
coutempla.ed. Its language will be plain and
terse, .tacts, impartially stated, win be itskey
note.
Its main plan â nil! be a record of the Mer
chants' Association, truthfully told by candid
observers. Extracts from the press at nome
and abroad will be a leuture. i redil will be
cheerfully given for every clipping. Commu
nication* upon pertinent questions from the
members of the association as well as me pub
lic Will be welcome. columns will always
be open to an honest expression of public
opinion. Its circulation will depend upon its
demand. No subscription price or charge of
any kind will be made.
Ihis Review will be strictly confined to sub
jects d.rectly affectiug the welfare of San
Francisco and its commercial interests.
bpeciitl attention will be paid to the streets,
hewers, parKs and roads of this county, with
the sole idea of their improvement. Subjects
pertaining to municipal revenue and taxation
I will be considered. A higher standard in the
; public service, as well as a better system of
municipal administration, will be advocated.
In offering this little Review to public recog
nition the Board oi Directors of the Merchants'
Association do not intend to publish a news
paper. The reader must not therefore expect
the many attractive features of a metropolitan
journal. The honorable field of journalism is al
ready ably and ful.y rilled by our public press.
Finally, permit ths assurance to be sincerely
given that the motto of this Monthly Review
will ever be the progress and prosperity of San
Francisco. In the service of this lofty cause,
if this little publication shall accomplish
some humble part the sole aim of its exist
ence will have been realised. Faithfully
yours, Hoard or Directors
OF THE Merchants' association.
AN OLD SUIT DISMISSED.
i>i i <-.toi â¢< of th>- Home ii in-lit i.i r- - As-
nociatiou Freed of Responsibility.
The suit of Daniel Â£L Perkinsand others
against the directors of the Home Benefit
Life Association was yesterday dismissed
by Judge Hebbard. The case has been in
thf courts for four years, but did not come
lo trial until last June.
The history ol the suit is a peculiar one
! and dates back over rf decade. In 1885 the
: company was incorporated to do an assess
j ment life insurance business and got along
| fairly well for a timtj. An epidemic, how
; ever, carried off a number of its pol cy
holi'ers, and the association was forced to
discontinue.
It seems that when the company was
i organized some legal technicalities were
i overlooked, and the persons who had paid
! a number oi assessments were got to
i nether, theii' claims combined and suit
Drought nu'uir.rit the directors lur the
I money paid in. Judge Hebbani. how
j ever, found .hat although tbe association
was not legally entitled to do a lite insur
ance business, the directors were unaware
of that fact and had proceeded in good
i faith. lie, therefore, dismissed the
action.

MERLE'S GA I Bft C OTRACT.
Judge Hebbnnl Grunts a I . -Iwiu mi* of
the Simulate Proceedings.
The fight of L. V. Merle against the
Board of Supervisors has been reopened.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a mo
; tion for a rehearing. Some time ago Merle
' applied for a writ of mandate to compel
the Supervisors to award him a garbage
contract which had been given by the
board to another person, who put in a
percentage bid.
The application was denied not because
! Merle was not the highest bidder but be
cause he had withdrawn his certified
check when tne contract was awarded his
rival. Judge Hebbsurd therefore decided
that the contract, had been let to nobody.
The case has been reopened by consent
of both parties. The Supervisors do not
think that Merle has any chance to win,
and believe that there is & possibility that
they may at another hearing.

NF.W YORK, N. V., Aug. 31.â A more con
fident tone characterized the railway and miscel

The transactions in stocks reach' a a total of 214."

was a slight period of hesitancy, ahles from Lon
don reporting A mer can securities slightly lower to
ri sy. An announcement of further engagement of
$3.600,000 gold abroad for shipment to New York
soon brought about a decided ciiange In sentiment,
and the market ruled strong until li>te in he day.
There was extensive ring of shorts through

The great factor at work, however, was the Im

the arnvasof last week tooting up the large to

lieve, the .fusion in money, and some of the
brokers In consequence were disposed to cover up
their Rhor: contract* and assume risk* on the bull
s de. No tirarins-hoMse loan certificates were
cal ed f r. and irom present appearances it is not
likely that any will be i(-su-d. I bis Is also having

The result was that some of the smaller hulls in

CHICAGO, 111. Aug. 31.â The week In the
wheat market was inaugurated with, an easy tone
and a slight depreciation in values, ascribed pri
marily to estimated liberal world s shipments for
th- week-7, .00.000 bushelsâ and to free North
western receipts, 864 cars against 554 last Mod
day. The business this morning was wanting in
life, however, and when the few minutes trading
was completed a dull and lifeless air took posses
-1 sion of the pit. Liverpool cables afforded no en
] cour semen;, that market being quoted quiet and
1 steady. Receipts at CMcaco new '208 cars and
148.350 bushels were withdrawn from store. The
visible supply statement, giving an increase of
3*5.100 bushels, occasioned disappointment and
moderate weakness.
The amount on ocean passage increased 1,140,
-000 bushels. Liverpool stocks of wheat decreased
223,000 bushels last week. Tne English visible
supply Increased 276,000 bushels, Closing cars
cables were 15 to 2t centimes lower for Hour find
unchanged for wheat. Antwerp was unchanged,
and Berlin i/i m<<rk higher for wheat. Export
clearames na<r.^eÂ«ted 247.753 bushels. Decem
ber whrat opened from 601 8 .0 60c, sold between
60V8@ b01 /ic and 58% c closing at 593,ic, 3/ 8 c un
der Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow,
280 cars.
CORNâ Obediently followed the direction of
wheat, tbe interest in tbe market and the volume
of trade not justifying an exercise of independence
of sentiment. Liverpool cables were lower and
helped 10 depress the market. The Monday- statis
j tics were not reassuring to holders, the amount on
â¢ octan passage increasing 1,600,000 bushels, and
I the vis bits supply decreas us; but 146,0U0 bushels.
Receipts were 864 cars and 648,882 bushels were
taken rom store. Export clearances amounted to
145,619 bu hels. May corn opened at 25 % c, de
clined to 25 1 ,8(gc25 1 closing at 2514 c, s/ 8 c under
Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, --30
cars
OATSâ Were comparatively steady, although
not entirely disregarding the influence of the
weakness of wheat and corn. Trading was not of
importance and consisted principally of local
transactions. Receipts were 46 cars, and 141,661
bushels were tak n m.m store. The visible stij>
p y decreased 172,000 bushels. Export clear
ancrs were 213.970 buehels. May oats closed Vgc
lower. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 470
cars.

NO PENNY PAPERS.
A Publisher Declares TliatJ â¢â¢They
Cannot Bo Blade to Pay in
Alameria County."
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 31. âF. A.
.Leach of the Oaktan i Enquirer conducted
the evening Item just one day, and to
night publishes the fo. lowing statement
concerning the two papers he purchased
Saturday:
It was announced Saturday that the
new proprietor of the Times and Item
would, on account of the many inquiries
as to the disposition of Vie Inner publica
tion, receive Bids for its purchase up to
Monday noon, August 31. It may be in
teresting to know that not a single bid was
received: consequently it will not be sold,
and os the new owner will not advance
feveral hundred dollars per month to keep
it alive, the Item has appeared for the last
time.
'â¢The total receipts for the Item for its
four months' existence were less than
$800, or $200 per month, and the extra ex
i-ense to the Times for producing it wiÂ«.s
double that. So it may be considere i,
with this evidence, that the effort to estab
lish a penny paper in Oakland has been a
" : failure."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1896.
NEITHER SUICIDE
NOR DESERTION,
Mr. and Mrs. Daniels Are
United and Live Across
the Bay.
END OF A ROMANCE.
The Landlady and Others Now
Regret Their Leniency and
Sympathy.
PLAN A SURPRISE PARTY.
Will Congratulate the Danie'ses and In
cidentally Present a Few Bills
With Requests to Pay.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 3L (
Mr. and Mrs. Daniels, late of Thirty
third street, have been located in San
Francisco and a delegation of their old
acquaintances in North Oakland are
arranging to give them a surprise party at
the fashionable boarding-house where
they are now residing.
A few weeks ago Mr. Daniels disap
peared. He left nis wife to go East, at
least so she told her neighbors, and time
passed away and nothing was heard of
him. Although the Danielses lived in a
comfortable furnished home near Tele
gTaph avenue and appeared to be very
prosperous, their neighbors learned with
some surprise that when the husband de
parted he left his wife with just 80 cents,
which of course was soon exhausted. The
charitable neighbors sympathized with
the heartbroken wife and gave her food
and looked after her health.
So deeply was Mrs. Daniels affected
when it was reported that her husband
might have been taken suddenly ill that
for a time she had to be watched night
and day.
One day Mrs. Daniels disappeared also,
ami her many sympathizers thought she
had gone ami drowned herself and her
sorrow in the cold waters of the bay. The
next chapter was devoid of all sympathy.
The landlady appeared on the scene,
and although she had been very sympa
thetic toward the deserted wife, the prac
tical side of her nature asserted itself and
expressed very positive views which were
based on the fact that the family with
aristocratic pretensions had, for quite a
time, neglected to attend to the rent. Other
matters of a similar nature had also been
neglected, and several people regretted
that they had met the man "who was
associated with mines and stocks."
When the landlady inspected her de
serted house she found that her late
tenants had not been any more careful than
aristocratic people are generally and she
would like to meet the Danielses and have
a settlement for damages as well aa rent.
Now the discovery has been made that
Mr. Daniels did not perish on his way
East, and Mrs. Daniels did ncjt court sur
cease from a broken heart off Goat Island,
but that both are enjoying life as much as
ever in San Francisco.
Their neighbors are not at all backward
in expressing their views of the circum
stances and declare that they will at once
advise the present landlord of the Danielses
that their tenants are subject to disappear
ance and other little irregularities not un
common to some people that "are as3o
ciated with mines and stocks."
SHOCKING DEPRAVITY,
Ignorance, Filth aud Crime Vnearthed
In the Tgchlch Family by Mrit
Prescott.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 31.â Mrs. Lydia
A. Prescott was appointed to the guardian
ship of Emma and Frida Tschich, the two
little girls of Mr. and Mrs. Julius. Tne
parents have been parted for years, tbe
mother living at 619 Broadway and the
father conducting a locksmith's business
at 1403 Park avenue, Alameda. The girla
are IS and 11 years of age.
The testimony showed that the children
were kept in a most iilthv place with do<rs,
and were diseased from contact with them .
The oldest girl had been assailed by men
along the wharf. Mr. and Mrs. Tschich
met twenty years ago in New York and
lived together thirteen years without any
form whatever, and there ha 3 never been
any divorce granted them, although Mrs.
Techich appeared in court with an infant
a year old which she said was the child by
Peter Otten, who formerly resided at 833
Magnolia street, but who is now dead.
Tschich admitted to Juiisre Greene that
he had $700 in bank and $1000 loaned out.
NO DEMOCRATS ARE LEFT
Bryan and Sewall Ratification
Ignored in Alameda
County.

Oaxlaxd Office Pan Frakcibco Call,)
808 ISroadway, Aug. 31. J
If William Bryan of Nebraska came to
Oakland he would probably draw a crowd
out of curiosity, but they certainly would
not be Democrats, for so far none have
been heard from since the Chicago circus,
when Pilate's instrument of torture wai
used with success as the key to a Presi
dential nomination.
"When are the Democrats of Alameda
County going to ratify? is the question
asked by everybody, but bo far uo one has
been able to reply.
There are a few Democrats left in the
county, but they have not yet mustered
up enough courage to ratify the Chicago
piatform and nominees, and so with the
exception of one or two, who manage to
keep to the front and would do so* no
matter to what party they belonged, the
voice of the Democrat is heard no more in
the land. The party in this county is
about equally divided between sound
money men and Populists.
Nothing is being left undone by the Re
publican party to win back for Alameria
the banner that was carried to Los An
geles in sackcloth and ashes a couple of
years ago. Next Saturday .night W. R.
Davies and Senator I'erkins will go to
Livermore to open the campaign there.
The vice-presidents for the "occasion are:
K. H. Pitcher, Joseph McKown, Charles
Hadsell, Wendell Jordan, H. p. Chad
bourn, Joseph Wilkinson, Robert Ellis,
Mark Apcers, 81. Moeller, Augustin Ber
nal, Joseph Nevis August Hagerman,

While the campaign committee of the
suffragist of Alameda Coanty have been
preparing its plans for organized pre
cinct work about the bay the county presi
dent, Mrs. Alice M. Stoker, has been busy
in the east end of the county.

OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 31. â Captain
Siebe, lessee of Shell Mound Park, had an
encounter with a pack of three of the most
ferociou 1 bulldogs that he has ever come
in contact with yesterday. He found
thorn in his pigpen, where they had killed
two hogs, and on opening the gate they
made for him, but he was enabled to close
the gate in time to keep them in. He se
enxed his rifle and dispatched them all.
No one appears to know to whom they
belonc or from where they came. On
Saturday they bit a cow of William Witn
row's so severely that she had to be killed.

Trustees of the Mechanics' Insti
tute Whose " Home Product "
Fair Opens This Evening at
the Pavilion.
hibition of home products appeared at the j
Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday afternoon. !
There was hardly a booth that was not
up and finished, ready for the reception of
the articles to be displayed in them, and
quite a number were in that state of com
pletion as to displays as to warrant t c
judges who are to award the prizes for the
best exhibit ready on opening day passing
upon them, but of course that will not be
done until late in the evening. The names
of the judges will not be announced until (
the three prize-winners are named. This
idea of offering cash prizes for best and
most complete displays on the day the i
fair is thrown open has proved a stimu
lating incentive to hurry up matters, and
for this the patronizing public will be :
thankful.
Atonnd the stderloors on Grove and
Polk streets there was all day yesterday a
perfect jam of, deuvery-wagons, loaded
with eoods of all kinds, and there was a
rush of men unloading heavy articles into j
the large building, and active young men, j
women and children receiving and carry
ing lieht bundles and parcels to the va- i
rious points where they were to be plactd '
on show. There was a hurrying to and
fro; exhibitors with goods jostled against
mechanics at work, in their eagerness to ;
deposit their bundles where the}- could be
opened and arranged on tables or shelves
to the best advantage. The superintend
ent, Mr. Gilmore, and his assistant, Mr. i
Clark, were surrounded all day long by
interested parties, anxious to know about
their rights.
A score of workmen were busy putting |
on the finjshmg touches on the miniature j
exhibit of the Union works, placing the I
different imitations of workshops, ship- '
ways, executive buildings, railways and '
storehouses in the relative position they j
occupy in the great yard in ti:e Potrero. !
In the annex in which this Is located there j
will be a fine electric-light display, and
the next most attractive exhibit in the
same room will be that of the Dairy
Union.
In machinery hall there is a very large ,
display of what Calilornia mills and i
foundries can turn out, and a great deal i
of the machinery will be in operation.

DARK RECORD OF ONE DAY IN THE CITY.
SHOT FOUR TIMES
BY HER HUSBAND.
Mrs. Joseph Kilciine Dying
at the Receiving
Hospital.
JEALOUSY THE CAUSE.
They Were Married Two Years
Ago, and She Left Him
Recently.
HE FIRED FIVE SHOTS AT HER
Kilciine W2S for Several Years
Connected With the Fire
Department.
Joseph Kilciine, an ex-stoker in the Fire
Department, fatally shot hi 6 wife Eliza at
MR. AND MRS. KLLCLLNE.
311 Jessie street yesterday afternoon
through jealousy and because she refused
to live wit i Lini any longer.
T^hey were n.arried about two years ago,
but did not live happily together and re
cently she left him. She called upon a
friendâ Lillian. Tiltonâ at 311 Je.-sie street
yesterday afternoon and while they were
chatting Kilciint entered the room. He
had been drinking and was in an ugly
mood. He went up to his wife and asked
her to go back and live with him. She re
fused and he pulied a revolver out of his
pocket and tired live shots at her in quick
succession, four taking effect.
The shots attracted the attention of Po
licemen Farley and T. F. Flynn and they
ran to the house. When the entered the
room where the shooting took ] lace Mrs.
Kilciine was stre;ched on the floor in a
pool of biuod and Kilciine was standing
looking down at her. They asked him
who had tired the shots and he said he did
not know anything about it.
Kiicline v.as placed under arrest and
the apparently dying woman was sent to
the Receiving Hospital in the patrol
wagon^ As Kilciine left the house with
the officers he saw a friend among the
crowd that had gathered and he called out
toohim that he had shot his wife because
she was to" intimate with "that fellow on
Third street."
At the Receiving Hospital Dr. Fitz
gibbon found that one bullet had entered
her right chest and taken a downward
course, piercing the lung; another had
entered her right arm, glanced upward,
and lodged in the deep portion of her
right shoulder. The other two struck her
on the right forearm, inflicting flesh
wounds. The doctor expressed the opin
ion that she could not live.
Chief Crowley sent Police Stenographer
O. H. Heyneman to take the woman's
ante-mortem statement. She made the
statement to him in the presence of Po
â¢ liceman J. C. Laws and Dr. Helms. She
was unable to sign her' name, but with

great difficulty succeeded in niakine a
cross. This is her statement :
My name is Eliza Kilciine. My husband,
Joe Kilciine, shot me four times this morning
in a house at 311 Jessie street, where I was vis
iting a friend of mine by the name of Lillian
Tilton. He shot me because I would not live
with him. He asked me to come back to him
and live with him, nn<i when I said that I
would not live with him h^ deliberately shot
me and I fell down. He stood there uiuii he
was arrested. Joe Kilciine is my husband's
name, and lie shot me without provocation.
Believing 1 am about to die, 1 herewith declare
this to be my last dying statement, and state
the same is the truth, and the whole truth, so
help me t.iod.
While she was making her statement
Kilciine had been taken from the City
Prison by Policemen Farley and Flynn to
the hospital. When she saw him she said:
"Thai's my husband, the man who shot
me." Kilciine did not say a word, but
burst into tears, and as the otlicers led him
away he attempted to get hack to her,
saying he wanted to see her again.
Kilciine when asked to make a state
ment was inclined to be surly. He at first
denied that he knew anything about the
shooting, but finally said: "My wife's
name was Eliza Peterson when I married
her on Ritch street two years ago.
"Last week she threatened to kill me.
She pulled a gun on me but I took it from
her. " I went to her to-day and aske 1 her
to come and live with me again, and she
said with an oath, 'Get out, or I'll shoot
you.' Then I shot her, and that's all there
is about it. 1 don't care if I swing for it.
1 am tired of life anyhow."
Kilciine joined the Fire Department on
September 20, 18S7 as extraman on engine
(j. He was promoted to stoker of engine
8, from there to engine 10, and then to
engine '2. On June 2?), last year, he was
dismissed from the department for im
proper acts and conduct. He ban been
arrested several times for minor offenses,
Buch as battery and disturbing the peace.
He is '26 years of age.
Mrs. Kilchne'fl mother lives on Sher
wood place, and she remained beside her
in the hospital all afternoon and all night.
She was heartbroken over the sad affair.
She said her daughter was "J4 years ot age.
COLIN CHETWOOD'S SUIT.
Struggle Over the "Winding Fp of the
Affairs of tlie California Na
tional 11.-ii.U.
The struggle between Colin Chetwood
Jr. ami the California National Bank etal.
is about to be resumed. A petition was
tiled in the Supreme Court yesterday ask
ing for a rehearing in bank. The language
of the petition is somewhat spirited in
spots. In one place it is asserted:
If tne litigation is not at an end then the
money in court in this proceeding should not
be turned over to Mr. not yet, if at
all. Btateler never had anil never can have a
strict right to these iuiids. He is the appointee
of Thomas, the man most at fault, the man
whose negligence, or worse, ruined thi* bank.
The transfer oi the tunds to him would be not
simply miscarriage, it would baa mockery of
justice.
Thomas has been neither detrauded nor op
pressed. He wrecked the bank but refused to
pay a cent of this loss. This court has not only
relieved nim from n.!l liability by reversing a
judgment of $139,000 against him, but even
actually hands over to him and to agents ap
pointed by him, the funds, 027,500, paid in
by others on account of the very debt he
should have paid. Nor is this all. He has not
only been decreed a share of this very money
paid in to make good the loss he has caused;
ho is actually held entitled to take from the
plaintiff, by Stateler, his agent, the stock of
Thompson and Wilson, presumably to share in
the dividends on that. We submit that the
decision and its results arc contrary to all
principles of equity and justice, and we re
spectfully ask that, this cause be heard in
bank."

The children have been quite ill for the
past ten days and their father, Frank
Lowery, a typs-setter in the employ of
Palmer <fe Rey, and his wife have watched
them almost continuously. The mother,
especially, absolutely refused to take nec
essary rest, and as her system seemed to
give way under the strain .she was forced
by her husband to leave the house on Sun
day night lor a breath of fresh air. The
couple wandered as far as the Orpheum,
and knowing the sick little ones were care

at home, they Btrayed into the place of

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1896.
AN ANGRY MAN'S
DESPERATE DEED.
Fires Five Shots at the
Woman He Loves Best
on Earth.
JEALOUSY THE CAUSE.
The Wouid-Be Murderer Then
Vainly Seeks to End His
Own Life.
WILL NOT DISCUSS THE AFFAIE
The Man's Name Is John Jilek and
That of His Intended Victim Mrs.
Ella Ferguson.
Jealousy, made more intense by an in
sane longing for the unattainable, nearly
caused a murder and suicide last night.
As it was, Mrs. Ella Ferguson suffered a
serious wound in the left arm and the
would-be assassin, John A. Jilek, has a
bullet in his abdomen, the pellet having
been sent there by his own hand. The
marvelous part of the shooting, however,
is found in the fact that five bullets were
fired at the woman at close range, only
one of which took effect. Her escape from
instant death is hardly short of a miracle.
The story is the old, old one of an un
requited love, in which the woman took
the initiative in breaking off the unequal
affection. Mrs:. Ella Ferguson is a petite
woman of the blonde type and her home
is 308 Minna street. Two years ago she
lost her husband, and since that time has
found some consolation in the company of
Jilek. In time, however, his attentions
became a burden and she sought every
reasonable means to rid herself of him.
Last night she called on Mrs. William
Goldsburg, 00:.' Ciotigh >treet, and a few
moments later Jilek put in an appearance.
Mrs. Ferguson requested the lady of the
bouse to withdraw for a few moments as
she desired to have a private taik with her
admirer. Just what passed between the
two is not definitely known, but hardly
five minutes had elapsed before Mrs.
Goldsburg heard a pistol shot, and then
another, and still a third, until five all
told had been tired. She rushed into the
room just in time to see Jilek place the
weapon to his stomach and send the one
remaining ball into his person.
The strange part of ttje whole affair is
that neither of the interested parties will
discuss the matter. Mrs. Ferguson de
clares she does not know who shot her,
while Jilek swears he cannot imagine
who it was who sought to end his lite.
The woman had her wound dressed at a
neighboring drugstore and then disap
pearea. Jilek was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, but later trausferred to the sta
tion.
"1 know nothing of the affair," he said.
"We were in the room and some one shot
a pistol several times, one of the bullets
finding a lodging-place here." and the
speaker pointed to his stomach.
Later it was learned that Jilek is em-
John A. Jilek, Who Last Night At

guson and I hen Sought to End llis
Life.
ployed as a clerk in a Kearny-street shoe
store. He is a German by birth and has
only been in this country about three
years. As neither of the parties will dis
cuss the affair it is that JileK
will be released in a day or so.
CASHIN'S ASSAILANTS.
Dan Ward, the Companion of John
Kelly, Is >on Behind the
Bars.
Dan Ward was arrested yesterday by
Detective T. L. Ryan and Policeman E.
ODea and taken to the City Prison, where
he will be charged with robbery and as
sault to murder.
Ward was the companion of John Kelly,
who broke into a room in the Oakland
House, 664VÂ£ Howard street, early Sunday
morning, August 16, and stole a gold
watch and |!)0 from the pockets of E.
Cashin, who occupied the room.
Cashin chased Ward, who had the stolen
property, and captured him, but Kelly
fired a shot at Cashin, the bullet striking
him in the leg, and he had to let go his
hold o Ward. Ward escaped, but Keily
wns captured by a citizen.
Since then Ryan has been searchinc
for Ward, and he and ODea found him
yesterday morning. He acknowledged
being with Kelly, but denied taking any
part in the robbery. Kelly's case will
come up in Judge Conlan's court this
morning, and Cashin, who lives in the
country, will be present and will have the
opportunity to identify Ward.
WILL BE ARRESTED.
Peter Vidak Charged With Perjury for
False Swearing While Being
Registered.
John M. Chretien and J. Alva Watt
were recognized by the Election Commis

health.
A. Ruef has been acting as Republican
representative since Sruiley's retirement,
but will now nive way to the two new ap
pointees, but may appear for the State
Central Committee.
A number of men who had been cited by
the Commissioners to appear and show
cause why their names should not be
stricken from the registration rolls were
examined. The majority showed that
they were eligible to vote and were kept on
the roll, but some few were stricken off.
The Registrar was instructed to swear
out a warrant for the arrest of Peter Vidak
of 323^2 Minna street, who was refused
registration at the Central Bureau because
lie could neither read nor write, and later
at the registration booth in his precinct
swore that he couid do both, and was reg
istered. He will be charged with perjury.

WILL CHANGE THE FEES
Justices <if the Peace Are Anticipating
the Decision of the Supreme
Court.
In accordance with the wishes of the
Justices of the Peace Cierk Ed Williams
of the Justice Court will begin to-day
charging fees as provided for under the
old fee bill and will continue to do so un
less the Supreme Court declares the new
law to be constitutional.
Under the old law the Justices were paid
out of the fees of the office so much for
eacli case or proceeding. This will not be
put into effect immediately, but the fees
will bn collected and put in escrow in the
treasury to await the decision of the
Supreme Court.
The cost to litiuants is practically the
same under the two bills, some fees beinc
higher and some lower. The main d'ffer
ence lies in attachments and default judg
men's, the cost under the rule that goes
into effect to-day being greater in the
former and less in the Iruter.

HARVEY IS ACQUITTED.
Other Charges Still Pending
Against the Stock
broker.
A Stubborn Jury That Was Not
Inclined to Follow the Juii
cial Advice.
Leroy G. Harvey, the stockbroker, on
trial for embezzlement of seventy-five
shares of Oakland Gas Light and Heat
Company stock, was yesterday acquitted
of the charge, the jury bringing in a
verdict of "not guilty," by instruction
of .Judge Bahrs.
The case has been on trial in Depart
ment 12 of the Superior Court for several
days, and yesterday morning the prosecu
tion closed its case. M. A. Dorn, attorney
for the defense, at once introduced a mo
tion to dismiss, on the ground that the
evidence was insufficient to convict. Dorn
claimed that Harvey was, by reason of the
transfer of the stock to him, its legal
owner, and could therefore not be con
victed of embezzling it. The jury was ex
cused until 2 p. m. to allow his Hunor time
to consider the motion.
When court convened in the afternoon
Judge- Bahrs read his decision. He said
in part:
The defendant cannot be convicted unless
the proof shows defendant to have come into
the possession of the property alleged to have
been embezzled as a ba:lee. This could not
huvt- been the case if the defendant was in
vested with the title to the said property at the
time he received it.
Maude A. *mith testified: "I indorsed the
certificate on the 2d day ol August, 1894, at
Mr. Harvey's rÂ» quest, at ivy house. Mr. Harvey
represented to my mother and 1 thai he had
some large dealings with some Eastern syndi
cate, and that it was necessary for him to rep
resent himself to them as a man of property,
and asked that this stock be indorsed that lie
might show them. An obj.-ction was made at,
the time, but Mr. Harvey said, 'Why, Mrs.
Bmitfa, you know that I have plenty" of real
estate, bat it is much more difficult to show
that as 'collateral,' I think^ou call it, 'than it
would be to show stock,' to we were williug,
and he said 'I a^k this as a personal favor; I
never asked one before, and on that account I
am sure you won't refuse me.'
"The question was asked Mr. Harvey at the
time 'Is that quite f<iir for you to represent
yourself the possessor of our property?' and
the reply was, 'You know that 1 have plenty of
real e.statc, an<l much more than the value of
that, but this was much easier and quicker.' "
The outcome of the transaction was that the
Certificate of stock was. indorsed in blank and
delivered to defendant, which transaction con
veyed title to defendant, according to section
324 of the Civil Code, winch section has iÂ»een
repeatedly construed by our Supreme Court to
nuan that the titie to certificate! of stock are
transferred by indorsement and delivery.
Therefore, according to rule of law furnished
by code, the title passed, and defendant dm
not receive the property us a bailee.
Independently of this rule ot law, the testi
mony clearly shows that the perties contem
plated that the defendant should use the prop
erty a^ if it wore his own; at all events, that
iie was to represent it as his own; thiu lie had
no right to ao unless he was clothed with ih
legal title, (or otherwise to have done so would
have been to commit, a fraud; this the law will
not permit. In law Miss Maud A. Smith must be
presumed to have granted enough to make the
privilege she gave defendant effective.
For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that
a conviction under the indictment upon which
the defendant Is on trial cannot be sustained,
and for that reason 1 advise the jury to ac
quit.
Although instructed to acquit, the jury
could not for a long time make up its
mind to do so. It was out for almost an
hour, and returned to report that it coulu
not agree, one juryman declaring that lie
would never consent to declare Harvey
not guilty.
The twelve good men and true were sent
out again, however, and on their rf-turn a
short time later rendered a verdict in ac
cordance with the instructions of the
Judge.
The threatened disagreement of the jury
caused a passage-at-arms between Judge
Bnlirs and Assistant District Attorney
H inkle. The attorney inquired what
course his Honor would pursue in case
the jury disagreed. The Juds;e was angry
at the action of the jury in debating at all
over his instructions, and replied that he
was as nmca a part of the court a? wns the
jury, and that he would himself discharge
the nnsoner.
There is still pending against Harvey
another charge of embezzlement, which
will in all probability be dismissed, and a
charge of grand larceny substituted. The
latter charge will be harder to dispose of
than that oi embezzlement.

JOHN COLLINS' VICTIM.
Struck Down and Brutally
Kicked During a Drunken
Carousal.
A LONGSHOREMAN'S WRATH.
He Claims the Woman Would Have
Died, Anyhow, as She Was
111 and a Cripple.
John Collins, a bu'-ly longshoreman,
dissipated and brutal in fact as well as in
appearance, occupies a prison cell at the
City Hall.
John Collins, the Longshoreman, Under Arrest for Uaving Caused the Death of
Mrs -Margaret Crowley by Beating and Kicking tier.
He is charged with murder â as cruel a
murder, too, as has ever been committed
in a civilized community.
His victim, a woman of the lower strata
of society, whom he kicfied into uncon
sciousness one week ago, died at the City
and County Hospital yesterday morning
and her remains are now at the public
Morgue.
The story of the kicking and how it
came about was told in the daily papers at
the time of Collins' arrest. He was a
neighbor of Margaret Crowley at 314 Beale
street and had become rather intimate
with her after the death of her husband
some four yer.rs before. Both drank
heavily, and on the evening on which he
beai the woman he had dropped in to
nave a "sociable drink" with her.
Mrs. Crowley had already procured a
pitcher of beer, which ttie couple b"nL>hed,
and Collins wanted some mure. Neither
was in a condition or inclined to visit the
neighboring grocery for the beverage, and
Collins suggested that the woman's little
daughter be sent out.
To this Mrs. Crowley demurred, and
Collins immediately proceeded to belabor
her for refusing to follow his advice.
While the mother was being beaten and
kicked the child escaped and brought in a
policeman, who placed Collins under ar
rest and sent Mrs. Crowley to the Receiv
ing Hospital.
Collins' victim was in such a bad condi
tion that she was conveyed from the Re
ceiving Hospital to the City and County
Hospital, where she died.
Collins has been very penitent since he
has sobered tin, and each day he has been
religiously inquirine as to the condition of
his victim.
"I'm sorry I killed her," he said yester
day. "1 did not intend to." Then, lean
ing his head against the prison bars, he
said: "But 1 don't think anything I did
to tier was the cause. She was a cripple
and all eaten up by disease, and all I did
was to push he r over and she fell. That
wasn't enough to kill her.
"1 have known the woman for a long
time and we lived together after her hus
band's aeath. Her little girl had a silver
ring belonging to me and I went over to
her house to get it. The little girl would
not give it to me so 1 boxed her ears. It
was then that Mrs. Crowley came at me
and I pushed her away. She fell, and I
suppose she hurt nerself, as she was a
cripple and in bad condition.
"I only pushed her away gently and I
didn't punch or kick her, as they say I
did."

V Diversity at Greencastle, Ohio, was in

H. Khara, a Japanese missionary from
Hono.ulu, was also introduced, and spoke

Rev. K. Lyman Hood of the Congrega
tional Monday Club was present, and pro
posed mat two or three times a year the
clergymen of this City and vicinuy hold a
union meeting. Rev. H. C. Harris and
Dr. Filben were appointed a committee to
confer on the subject with committees
from other religious bodies.
At the Congregational Monday Club
Rev. P. B. Perkins read a paper on "Our
Spirituality ami Our Individual Relations
with God." He held that men should
aspire fora mental state inspired by the
Holy Spirit, by which they can look at
and see things as God does. This spiritu
ality would be the uniting of earth and
heaven.
He believed the supreme need of the
church to-day to be a spiritual mind, just
as the apostles and prophets of old were
one with God.
Furthermore, he did not believe the pul
pit should deal with political questions,
but that it the heart were properly edu
cated the mind would soon find itself in a
condition tovotewitn intelligence.
A free discussion followed the reading
of the paper, in which the author was
commended for the thoughts he had ad
vanced.
At the Presbyterian Union H. J. McCoy,
secretary of the main body of the Y. M.
C. A., di-coursed on "Religious Effort for
Young Men." He said it had been author
itatively announced that a sufficient num
ber of young men reached their majority
every four years to control completely
the Presidential election of the United
States. Of these he believed only 2 per
cent were Christians. Dr. Mackenzie and
others believed the percentage was much
larger than tliis.
Secretary McCoy then stared that he be
lieved the conversion of the young men ot
the country would be the solution pt the
social and economic questions of the day.
He urged business men to do more for the
young msn; mothers to open their parlors
to them, and all others to extend the band
of sympathy. Only in this way did he be
lieve the reforms could be accomplished.
The subject for the day at the meeting
of the Baptist ministers was, "Should
There Be Only One Christian Organization
in Every City?" The speaker, the Rev.
M. P. Boynton. being absent, the theme
was talked over in an informal manner
only.
It was announced that a religious con
ference will be held September 14 and 15

Keecn.

blage that in view of the postponement of
