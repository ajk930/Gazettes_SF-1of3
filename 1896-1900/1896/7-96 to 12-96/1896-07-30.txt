The Outrageous Scheme Proposed
â¢ :. . "by Senator Allen of
Nebraska.
SEEKING TO SECURE EASTERN
VOTEB.
Result of a Resolution Rushed
'.-" â Through the People's Party
Convention.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 29.â There
is said to be on foot a project so bold and
audacious that only the desperate deter
mination of the Democratic managers to
win the election next fall by any means,
fair or foul, can furnish warrant for its
belief. The project is said to be nothing
' o elseÂ°than to force" Tom Watson of Georgia
off the -Populist ticket Senator Allen of
Nebraska, the foremost Populist in the
' party, is said to have conceived this
scheme and to have found in Senator
Jones of Arkansas, leader of the Demo-
â¢ cratic campaign, and Senator Jones of
Nevada, the brainiest and most energetic
man in the Silver party, able and willing
allies.
During the Populist convention in 8t
Louis last week Senator Jones of Arkansas
was constantly on the ground and was in
communication with Senator Allen of
Nebraska. Mr. Jones of Nevada was also
Â° . present, attending either the Silver con
vention or seated among tbe distinguished
guests off the platform of the Populists.
The three Senators worked hand in hand.
Their purpose was to secure fusion be
tween the three parties and the indorse
ment of 'the Democratic ticket by both
. Silver men and Populists.. Senator Jones
â¢ of Nevada carried out his part of the pro
gramme. The Silver party indorsed Bryan
â and Se wall. 3 Senator Allan succeeded only
partially. Mr. Bryan was nominated, but
even the influence of the Nebraska Senator
was powerless to force the Maine million
aire and National bank president down
i the throats of ' the Populists, and so the
combination was defeated in that conven
â¢ O tion*
a It was an easy matter, however, to de
ceive by parliamentary trickery the ignor
â¢ ant delegates who attended that remark
-0 able convention. To these people parlia
. mentary law was almost .unknown, and it
was therefore not difficult for Messrs.
Jones and 'Allen, whose experience in the
o United States Senate, aided perhaps by.
'â¢ . Â°sÂ°bre.wd cdunsel from distinguished Demo
crats* who were not in St. Louis during the
.* . convention, to devise a scheme by which
the plan of making the Populist ticket
Bryan and Sewall, instead of Bryan and
Watson, might yet be carried out. In the
1 closing moments of the convention, when
Â° those delegates who were not indulging in
o fisticuff were putting on their hats and
* coats preparatory to leaving, an innocent
resolution was introduced â authorizing the
executive committee to fill vacancies.
. Senator Allen, who was presiding,'
â¢-* changed the verbiage of this , motion so
\ that it authorized the committee, on the
. dissolution of tb^e convention, to exercise
â¢â¢â¢â¢^plenary powers and to all things that the
/ convention might do if in session. Before
any delegate could have protested, even if
â¢*â¢ he had been shrewd enough to discover
the o bidden purpose, Mr. Allen declared
the motion carried.
â¢ The purpose of this resolution now be
;*. comes apparent, it was intended at first
to bring pressure to bear on Mr. Watson
to influence him to resign from the ticket.
Recent interviews with that gentleman
would seem to indicate that he has no
Â° o such intention. His candidacy, however,
is recognized by the three conspirators as
being simply o impossible and his presence
on the ticket would make the Populist
campaign ridiculous, therefore if he can
not induced to withdraw by persuasion
his retirement will be accomplished by
0 force. If will be held that the Populist
convention cave to the executive com
* c mitÂ£ee full power to take any action
Â° which .in the committee's â¢ opinion is for
,the best interests of the Populist party.
â¢ They will hold that Mr. Watson's with
. dVawal is imperative and will, therefore,
officially promulgate the ticket of the
. * Populist party <to be Bryan and Sewall.
o o They know that there will be a howl
Â° from the South, but this is a matter of
indffference to them. The solid South can
be relied upon for the Democratic ticket,
by hook or crook, and no questions asked.
0 Senator Allen himself knows from bis
efforts alt last year to bring about an in
vestigation of .- the methods by which
Democrats in Alameda : carried the ticket
against the fusion of the Populists that
even if questions arc asked they will not
be answered. The Eastern Populists are
those whose votes the combine is plan
ning to secure, and in the West Mr. Sewall.
' in spite of his millions and , his National
bank relations, is much stronger than the
Congressional clown, Watson. ;;
To Mr. Allen will be intrusted the prac
tical execution of ; the scheme. He is an
able rq,an and full of determination, and if
he finds that it is safe to perpetrate this
high-handed outrage ;on the rights and
liberties of the mob that met at St. Louis
, last week he will not hesitate .to carry it
out.
WHA T WALSUS WANTS.
Be Hays That Seteall Should Be With
drawn by the Democrats.
ATLANTA, Ga., July 29.â The Atlanta
Constitution, desiring to learn just what
Hon. Tnomas Â£. Watson, the People's
The San Francisco Call.
party Vice-Presidential nominee, thinks
of the present peculiar situation, tele
graphed him to-day as follows:
"In your letter sent out last night from
Augusta, you say that if the Democrats
are ready for a fair division of electors so
are you, and if not then two sets of electors
will be put in rhe held. Please wire the
Constitution upon receipt of this your idea
of a fair division. On the basis of what
vote do you think apportionment of elec
tors m the several States should be made?
Kindly define your position on this point
in order that we may give it publicity."
To this Mr. Watson replied: "I state
that what I have heretofore said was based
upon tbe idea that your party would show
some patriotism and retire Mr. SewalL If
he remains on the ticket and your party
declines the St. Louis overtures tbere can
be no division on electors. There can only
be a straight fight. The Democratic man
agers must not demand that the Populists
do all tbe yielding. You must do some of
it yourselves. Sewall can come off the
ticket without hurting his party. My with
drawal would kill mine. Our people can
not be led to the support of Bryan and
Sewall. Unless Sewall retires the masses
of our party will, in my judgment, demand
a straightout Populist ticket.
"Thomas E. Watson."
Upon receipt of this the Constitution
telegraphed Mr. Watson again that his tele
gram did not answer the question, and
aoked: "On the basis that neither you
nor Mr. Sewall can or will retire, how can
fusion on electoral ticKets be accomplished,
and on the basis of what vote should ap
portionment between Populists and Demo
crats be made?"
Mr. Watson has not replied to this last
telegram.
CLETELAND'S CA BINET TROUBLES
Speculation as to Whether Secretary
Smith Hill or Will Xot Jtesign.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 29.â One of
tbe most interesting unsolved problems in
Washington to-day is the question whether
Hoke Smith of Georgia has resigned or is
about to resign as Secretary of the Interior.
Tbere i> a widely prevailing impression
that the President's action to-day in select
ing a West Virginia man, at the request of
Postmaster-General Wilson, for Union
Pacific railroad director, an office under
the control of the Interior Department,
was intended as a direct snub to Secretary
Smith and was meant to be so regarded by
him, especially as there does not appear to
have been any pretense made by the Presi
dent of asking the advice of the Secretary
of the Interior on the matter.
Mr. Cleveland's known views against
the free coinage of silver were entirely in
accord with those expressed by his Secre
tary of the Interior in his recent joint dis
cus3ion with ex-Speaker Crisp of Georgia.
But the fact that Mr. Smith's newspaper,
the Atlanta Journal^ has since come out
in favor of Bryan and Sewall and free sil
ver and the further fact that Mr. Smith
himself is advertised to open the cam
paign in favor of Bryan and free silver at
Augus;a. Ga., on the 12th of August next
lias naturally revived the rumors that Mr.
Smith's resignation wilx either be request
ed or enforced within a very few days.
Secretary Smith, being asked this even
ing whether it was true that he proposed
to go to Gray Gables for consultation with
President Cleveland prior to entering on
the Georgia campaign, declined to make
any statement for publication.
NOMINCE B RYAN'S PLANS.
He Will Go to Jew lork on August 12
to Attend the Notification Meeting.
LINCOLN, Nkbr., July 29.â Mr. Bryan
was officially informed by teleeraph" to
day that August 12 has been settfed as the
date for the Democratic notification meet
ing at Madison-square Garden, New York.
This arrangement is satisfactory to him,
and he will make his plans accordingly.
What those plans are Mr. Bryan will not
tell until they are fully settled, but it is
understood that he will make several
speeches at big cities en route to New
York. The Democratic nominee had a
quiet day. He is catching up on his cor
respondence, with the assistance of sev
eral clerks, and now that the letters of
congratulations have ceased to come in
and as much of the mail matter will be
transferred to the National Committee for
reply he will probably have his desk
cleared by the time he starts East.
Among the visitors to-day were three
Mishissippiana, who have been on a hunt
ing trip west of Lincoln, and who stopped
over here to assure Mr. Bryan of their
â npport. They are Dr. W. H. Baird of Ox
ford; J. S. McDonald, president of the
Delta Bank of Greenwood; and Hon. G.
A. Wilson of Lexington, formerly State
Senator. Mr. Wilson has been a gold
man, but be joined with his companions
in promising to work for the Democratic
ticket.
SOUND-MO NEY DEMOCRATS.
Progress of the Movement to Nominate a
Third- Party Ticket.
CHIC*AGO, 111., July 29. â Messrs.
Bynum of Indiana and Robbins of Illinois,
members of the National Executive Com
mittee of the sound-money Democracy,
were in conference at headquarters most
of the day, working on the organization
in numerous States, receiving telegrams
on the subject and sending others to the
leaders who are taking the initiative in the
new-party movement.
Charles H. Baker of Seattle telegraphed
that steps are being taken to organize
Washington in the interest of sound
money, and that a National Committee
man would be sent to Indianapolis.
E. D. McKee of Portiand, Or., who is a
party leader in that State, telegraphed
that he has taken action toward organiza
tion in that State.
Hon. John P. Irish, a prominent Cali
fornia Democrat, wrote: "California will
co-operate in putting a sound-money
Democratic ticket in the field, and will
send a representative to a convention for
that purpose. I regard it as of prime im
portance that every Southern State be rep
resented."
Encouraging telegrams were received
from a number of Eastern States.

Honorable Plaintiff Must Pay
Costs of Action.
LONDON, Enq., July 29âA decision

eral Kirkham of San Francisco. This
dismisses the petition of the husband,
Hon. Walter Yarde-Buller, for divorce!
and orders him to pay the costs of the
action.
Tbe case has excited much interest in
fashionable cirnes, and much sympathy
has been expressed for Mrs. Yarde-Buller,
who, wbile testifying in her own behaif,
told a distressing story of her domestic
life.
The case against Gadesden was dis
missed and he was allowed costs.
At to-day's session Ralph Blair, a lieu
tenant in the Devonshire Artillery Volun
teer and son of the respondent by her first
husband, testified to Mr. Yarde-Buller
striking vis wife. Upon one occasion he
saw Mr. Yarde-Buller knock his wife's
head against a door. Witness added that
he interfered and struck Mr. Yarde-
Buller.
Replying to further questions, Lieuten
ant Blair said that he had lived at Churs
ton while Valentine Gadesden was there
and asserted that he never saw or sus
pected anything wrong.
Valentine Gadesden testified tbat he
went to California from England in 1887
and later engaged in mining, ranching
and real estate transactions. He con
tracted to come to England in order to
attend to the affairs of the respondent.
He swore that he had never been intimate
with her.
Upon cross-examination witness said
that at one time he believed tbat the re
spondent was in danger of becoming in
sane. He had heard her screaming and
raving in abject terror of the petitioner.

A HOPELESS MUDDLE.
Anarchists Continue to Break Up Meeting*
of the Socialist Labor Congress
in London.
LONDON, Esq., July 29.â The Interna
tional Socialist Trades Congress resumed
its session to-day. Up to the present time
the congress bas done nothing but exam
ine the credentials of delegates, and of
those examined thus far only two-thirds
have been passed upon as entitling their
holders to take part in the deliberations of
the congress. Harmony prevailed during
the early part of the day's sitting, but was
broken on the introduction of the question
of admission of anarchist delegates, who
though nominally excluded from taking
part, are actually attending the sittings
and votine as trades unionists. The
whole affair is considered a hopeless mud
dle.
The French socialist delegates to-day
expressed a desire to be separated from
tbe French anarchists, and this gave
rise to an exciied debate which culmin
ated in the spokesman of the American
delegation crying out, "America favors
the separation ot the socialists from the
anarchists."
Immediately scores of opponents of the
separation idea rose to their feet, bellow
ing and shrieking in :ury. Chairman
Hyndman rang his bell and called for or
der amid screams of "Vive l'anarchie! A
bas tyranny !"
These cries were connwred by Saxon ex
pletives and seeing that all attempts to
restore order were useless. Chairman
Hyndman peremptorily adjourned tae sit
ting and the delegates separated amid the
greatest uproar.

SCIENCE STAYS
DEATH'S HAND,
William Young's Lease of
Life Lengthened Just
a Year.
DONE BY AN OPERATION
He Expires Twelve Months After
Surgeons Removed a Tumor
Near His Heart
A TRIUMPH OF ELECTRICITY.
Blood Coagulated Between the Walls
of the Aorta to Heal a
Rupture.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 29.â A wonder
ful surgical operation, which prolonged a
young man's life a year in the face of
death, became known here to-day. Wil
liam H. Young, a barber, aged 36 years,
died late last night of aneurism of the
aorta. In plain English, this means a
rupture of the greater artery leading from
the heart. The aorta is composed of three
layers, and in case of aneurism these lay
ers are so ruptured as to allow the blood
to dilate the outer coat, forming a tumor
which fills with blood, thereby obstruct
ing tbe circulation.
Such was Young's affliction, and he suf
fered tortures from it for several years.
He was then a resident of Denver. He
lost weight and strength, and finally as a
last resort was placed upon the operating
table to undergo the operation that was to
prolong his life or stop it altogether.
On account of the great danger and the
almost fatal result of an anesthetic
Young bravely went through the oper
ation without anything to relieve the ter
rible agony. He was placed upon the
table *nd his breast bared for the knife.
An electric battery of great strength was
at hand, provided with gold wire of thread
like diameter. This was used on account
of its purity and freedom from noxious
elements. Then a surgeon opened Young's
breast, found tbe tunr.or and inserted
thirty inches of gold wire in it and turned
on the electric current. The result was
such an intense heat that the blood in the
tumor was forced back into its proper
channel.
Through all the horrible agony, wit â .
electric tires burning within a few inches
of his heart, Young stood tbe test like a
hero, though he fainted after it was all
over.
So powerful was the electricity tbat a
sponge applied to his back to complete the
circuit raised a large blister. (
Young was treated with great care, and
he rapidly rallied from the shock of the
operation. Thenceforth his health for a
time was excellent. In six months or so,
however, he began to fail again, and last
March he came to San Diego to try the
effect of the climate.
A post-mortem examination was made
to-day Dy several prominent surgeons of
the city, and it was found that the coagu
lated blood had entirely departed from the
tumor. The opinion of the scientists was
that Young's life had been prolonged at
least a year by the operation. It is re
garded as wonderful, and correspondence
will be instituted with tbe Denver sur
geons who performed it, in order to learn
further facts concerning it.
KENTUCET POLITICE.
Congressional Candidates Come to Blows
Huring a Joint ltebate.
BARBOURSVILLE, Kt., July 29.â The
public discussion between the Congres
sional candidates, David D- Colson and ex-
Congressman Jonn D. White, came near
terminating seriously yesterday at Flat
Lick. While Colson was speaking he ac
cused White of planning to assassinate
him, which White immediately answered
was a lie, and tbe two rushed together for
a free fight and were prevented only by
the interference of the enormons crowd
present at the time.
Colson tn en proceeded and challenged
White to fight a duel according to the
code recognized in such cases. This While
refused with the remark that he was not
looking for trouble, but would continue to
make his canvass for Congress.
MARTIAL, LAW AT ZURIVH.
Thousands of Italians Are fleeing from

ZURICH, Switzerland, July 29.â The

still continues and the streets are occupied
by troops. Crowds of Italians are gathered
at the railway station awaiting an oppor
tunity to leave the city, and it is estimated
tbat 6000 are making preparations to de
part. The proprietors of the various
lodging-houses, fearing that their prop
erty would be damaged, turned their
lodgers into tbe streets and 1500 of those
thus rendered homeless were obliged to

Electors in Favor of the St Louis
Nominees to Go on the 0 ficial
Ballot.
DENVER, Colo., July 29.â The Repub
lican State Central Committee, by a vote
of 48 to 37, to-day adopted a resolution in
dorsing the St. Louis platform and McKin-.
ley and Hubart, and urging the State con
vention to select Presidential eiectars
pledged to vote for the candidates of the â¢
Rermblican party. This result, however,
was not obtained until three hours had.
been consumed in the most bitter debate,
replete with personal abuse and displays
of passion. Irving Howbert, chairman,
retired when the vote was announced, he
having previously indicated a desire to re
sign from the office. J. W. L. Hodges was
'elected to succeed him.
The new chairman announced that all
members of the State committee who did
not intend to vote for McKinley and Ho
bart would not be recognized, and ha
asked them to leave the room, adding
that should they decline to do so, he
would neither recognize them nor permit '
their votes to be recorded. This was a
firebrand which caused an instantaneous
explosion, and personal violence seemed
imminent.
A woman member calmed the angry
men by securing the floor and begged the
committee to listen to her. Then she
asked the chairman to give the bolters
time to repent. This sally quieted the
men considerably, and after protests had
been made by many of Hodges' sup*
porters he withdrew the ruling.
A motion to delegate the powers of the
committee to a sub-committee of five, with
full executive power, was presented, but
under protest it was amended to tbe ex
tent that the committee report its action
to the whole committee. A recess was
taken until 8 o'clock.
The indorsement of the platform shows
that Senator Wolcott's friends are in tho
majority and will have their way* A. M^
Stevenson, one of the bolters of the St.
JL<ouiB convention, is leading the minority,
and he boldly asserted in the committee
his intention to support Bryan and SewalL
"We will turn you down when the Stata
convention meets" was his defiance.
McKinley electors now go on the officia
ballot.
After an exciting evening session tt j

for holding the State convention as Sep

issue the call and provide therein as to
who may be entitled to seats in the con*
vention. It is a McKinley victory.
The minority in the deliberations to-day
have sent notice to all absent members,
recommending another meeting of the
committee, when no proxies will be per*
mitted. This meeting is to overturn the
work accomplished to-day. A struggle is
now on for the eagle, the ballot emblem.
COLLEGE MEN CONGRATULATION.
Major McKinley Addresses a Delegation
From Chicago University.
CANTON. Ohio, July 29.â After Majoi
McKin ley returned from Cleveland to-day,
a committee representing the Republican
Club of the University of - Chicago arrived
and presented him with a bust of bimselj
made by Hans Hirsch, a member of thÂ«
club.
In accepting it, Major McKinley said it
was a good omen to rind the young mea
from many colleges of the United State}
joining themselves in Republican organii
zations to sustain Republican principle!
and the National honor, and that there is
no class ,of men more . potent . than tbost
who go out of the colleges to every county
and State of the United States. "I am
clad," he said, "to know that Republican
principles are such that they can be subÂ»
pitted with safety and confidence to thi
intelligence of the educated men of tha
country." . r
POSTAL CLERKS INSECCTED.

WASHINGTON, D. C, July 29.â ThÂ«
Postoffice Department has is.-ucd a circa

Reed since the National convention. The
speakers were greeted with ereat en
thusiasm. Mr. Reed spoke as follows :
â¢ Two months ago no man of an y standing
would have risked hi* reputation as a prophet
by hinting the slightest doubt of Republican
success. Now there are ihiwe who tell us that
all things have changed. Thismar be so, but to
me it doe* not seem probable. It would beun
â wise, =unjust and sent-eless to confound the
Democratic organization with individual Dem
ocrats. When S:ephen A. Douglas declared,
afier Sumterwas fired on, that 'thenceforth
there could be hut two parties, patriots and
traitors," he won the rtspect even of foes, and
an imperiihabie place in history. We shall
certainly welcome all Â«uch men to-day, Hot
that they are to be Republicans, for they will
not be, tut because they are patriots, for that
they must be.
There are some political orators who think
If they draw a rose color in the picture it ought
to convert a continent. What a rosy picture I
we had painted for us in 1892. What millions
*we were to expect. We were to sell in the dear
etVand buy in thÂ°e cheapest market. We took
the;r word for it and here we are. Now, the
Teas: credible part of these same gentlemen
are smearing the canvaÂ» with another picture,
for which they want us to pay auother four
years, or perhaps ten, of this Nation's life.
Men deceived once are" human: men deceived
twice bythe same men are fools. lam bound
to say that the evil which has come to pg by
an unwise revision of the tariff had been
greatly aggravated by one of its consequences
âour loss of revenue. The constant increase of
the deficit (continually confounded witn the
redemption of gold) has so afflicted the imag
inations of the people that confidence cannot
commence to be restored until our revenues
equal our expenses.
Let us see what is proposed by these gentle
men who within tiie last two months have dis
covered a new cure for all the ills that flesh is
neir to. Theis remedy is the coining oi silver
at 16 to 1. What does that me.an? Heretofore,
whenever gold and siiver have stood together
it hu been at the market value. When we
tried to make gqld and silver circulate to
gether we have always married* them accord
ing to their market value. To-day, we find
\hem, not 16 to 1, but 31 to 1, and We are go
ing, they say, to lift silver to twice its value,
not by the universal sense of mankind, which
nlofle makes values, but by the statute of the
United States, single-handed against the civil
ized world. Why should the United States try
to do thia alone? If the demonetization of sil
ver is a disease at all, it is a world disease.
Hew can it bÂ« reached except by a world rem
edy? .
International bimetallism I can understand,
but this driving out of gold and substitution of
silver is only silver monometallism for the
United States. Ir is shifting from gold cur
rency and civilized Europe and going over to
siiver and Mexico, Japan, India and China.
If we "are going to have a dollar inferior to
what we have to-day, what wiil be ihe effect of
it? Higher prices they say. Not for every
thing. If you have $100 in the savings bank
to-day you can get 100 gold dollars from tbe
bank. If this wild project succeeds ana you
are paid in silver you will get the $100, but
they will be flity or sixty or seventy cent dol
lars. If you have a pension,, that must be
scaled down. If you have a bond, that goes
down, too. Wnat you buy will go up. Will
wages go up too? Wages during greenback
times, measured in gold, did not go up as other
o things did. They went part way, but not all
the way up. and were very slow abont that.
What this country needs is capital from
abroad. In the United States are mlllions.of
square miles and 75,000,000 of people and un
developedÂ°riches without stint. Btft there is
not capital enough to keep 75,000,000 of peo
ple at work. We are most prosperous when
the 75,000,000 are all at work, and when that
happens we borrow of the rest of the world
thousands of millions ot dollars. Now Just as
soon as this election is over, and the future po
sition of the United States is assured, both as
to money and to the unemployed oi our peo
ple, capital Is ready to come to us from abroad
o and from our own people, and we shall again
be prosperous.
We have been through all this once before.
The Greenbackers of 1878 were not ba*' men.
They were sincere and had a better case than
tbe silver men of to-day. We must have artifi
cial inflation and cheaper money, they 6*id, or
blackest ruin awaited us. Prices were low and
work was scarce. Taxes were high end debts
hard to pay, but we persevered and resumed
specie payments. From that moment the cap
ital of the world was at our disposal: We had
a eood tariff, whicn made us do all our own
work, and from 1879 to 1893, fourteen years of
prosperity, which placed the United States in
a great position in the world. If we do the
like thing to-day like things will follow. With
revenues equal to our emergencies undue ex
port of gold will cease. With the certainty
that tbe dollar paid will be equal to the dollar
loaned will come credit and confidence. With
that other certainty that we are to do all our
own work will come the earning ot wages, in
creasing steadily, which is the basis of that
prosperity which is alone worthy of this great
Nation, the prosperity of the whole people.
THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN.
Assignment of Speaker â Â» for Duty in the
Western States.
CHICAGO, If.LT, July 29.â For the first
time since the National" Republican" head
quarters were opened all the executive
' committee members assigned to the West
ern campaign were present and in confer
ence. Owing to the absence of Chairman
' Hanna no formal conference was held, but
Messrs. Dawes of , Illinois, Payne of Wis
consin, Durbin of Indiana and Leland of
Kansas spent a busy day in their offices,
either in consultation or transacting busi
ness with numerous callers from different
States.'
The committee has decided to recognize
a committee of .. five, chosen by the State
and National Associations of Republican
.Commercial Travelers, for tha purpose of
> helping in the campaign in their peculiar j
way. The committee will be given space
at headquarters and be supplied with all
the iiterature it wants. In other respects
it wiil be left free to carry out its own
plans.
Mr. Hahn, chief of the speakers' de
partment, made his first assignments to
day, giving to Senator Thurston the fol
lowing appointments to open State cam
paigns: Madison, Wis., July 31; Mil
waukee, August 5; St. Paul, August 7;
Duluth, August 8; Topeka, August 12;
Ottumwa, August Ij. After the Nebraska
orator Das made speeches at the foregoing
places he will go East under the direction
of the New York headquarters, making
several speeches and returning to the
Western department the first week in Sep
tember for further assignments. It is the
policy of the National committeemen not
to send out many speakers prominent in
public life during the early part of the
campaign, but speeches will be made by
the committee's speakers during Augu?t,
in the Dakota*, Nebraska, Minnesota,
lowa and Kansaj. Mr. Hahn has about
150 applications on file from persons of
more or less merit, who want to be en
gaged to take the stump by the National
Committee.
Judge A. A. Post, chairman of the Ne
braska State Central Committee, and Sen
ator Tburston have arrived from that
State and are spending some time at head
quarters. Judge Post said to a United
Pres3 reporter:
"McKinley will carry Nebraska by a
large majority. Bryan's neighbors regard
him as an amiable fellow and clever, but
they do not want to see him President.
Personally they like him, but politically
they are apainst him. I expect to see him
defeated in his own ward in Lincoln, in
his ccunty, his Congressional district and
in the country at large. Nebraska is as
strongly for McKinlt- y as it wap at the
start, and the party is organized as it never j
was before."
Senator Thurston said : "The prospects j
of Republican success seem to crow !
briebter every day. I think Bryan
reached the heigln of his popularity the
day after he was nominated, and he has
been losing ground every day since. The ]
older the campaign grows the more re- :
mote will become the chances of his elec- i
tion. The Nebraska farmers will remain i
true to their party, which they have been
loyal to during the onslaught of Populism
for years."
Cyrus Leland, speaking for Kansas, told
his fellow-committeemen that he was cog
nizant of a revulsion of feeling in favor of
the Republican piatform since the silver
smoke of the last three conventions has
cleared away and he looks for accessions
from the country.
Hon. Roswell Horr of New York bas I
been assigned by Mr. Hahn to Nebraska I
for six meetings and to Minnesota for ten
meetings.
James N. Huston of Indiana, ex-United
States Treasurer, and j. T. Doxey of Ander
son, candidate for Governor at the recent
Indiana convention, called at headquar-'
ters. Mr. Huston said: "Political man
agers must not presume on the ignorance
of the masses on the money question.
Every piece of literature should be care
fully inspected. The average voter knows
as much as the leader did ten years ago."

The only States of the circuit not repre
sented at the conference were Maine,
Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama.
The conference lasted nearly four hours, I
the major portion of the time being taken
up in listening to a statement from ex- '
Postmaster-General Wannamaker, who
told of the condition, politically, of Penn
sylvania and what he expected it would
do for McKinley.
After the conference the executive com
j mittee held a session. Several names
were suggested, but no one was selected i
for the ninth place on the committee, i
Mr. Bius, the former treasurer of the com- j
mittee, who has held over, pending the
election of his successor, was re-elected
and consented to serve. Mr. Hanna was
authorized to name a man to represent
Utah, and he chose a Mr. Rogers, who
was recommended by Senator Brown.
Mr. Hanna, Mr. Quay and Mr. Scott were
the only members of the executive com
mittee at the meeting.

CUBAN EXILES
HARASS SPAIN.
Secret Committees Have
Been Discovered in
Madrid.
PLOTS OF SEPARATISTS.
Insubordination in the Army
Fanned by Incendiary
Literature.
DESERTIONS ARE NUMEROUS.
Reinforcements lor Weyler Will B3
Sent Unarmed as a Precau
tion Against Mutiny.
LONDON, Eng., July 29.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Lisbon says that
private advices received from Madrid
state that the existence of secret Cuban
committees has been discovered there,
and that certain CuDan exiles have van
ished. It has also been discovered, the
Madrid advices say, that separatist
schemes relative to the Philippine
Islands are on foot.
As a result of certain acts of insub
ordination among the last 600 men em
barked for Cuba and the discovery that
secret proclamations were being circulated
among the soldiers, and in view of the
notorious reluctance of the troops to co to
Cuba, the re-enforcements, 40,000 strong,
who will be embarked at the end of
August, will be shipped without arms,
through fear of a mutiny among them,
and their arms will be forwarded by other
vesseh.
The advices also state that desertions
from the army are numerous, especially
in Aragon. Fear is entertained by the
authorities that disorders will occur i.i ;
the dispatching of re-enforcements for tne
Spanish forces in Cuba, and elaborate pre
cautions are being taken to prevent trouble.
Instructions have been given to the Span- j
ish censor to suppress all telegrams relat- |
ing to the matter.
WEFLLE'S TOUCH CAMPAIGN.
Five Thousand Cuban Homes Destroyed
in One Hern.
CHICAGO, 111., July 29.â A special
from Key West, Fla., says:
The situation in Cuba is gTowing worse.
According to advices received here the in
surgents are destroying trains by dyna
mite and burning sugar estates, while the
Spaniards continue to burn the houses of
Cuban peasants. Official reports show the
Spaniards burned nearly 5000 homes in the
lsst week. In many cases these homes
were occupied by women, the men being
in the insurgent army.
This campaign of the torch which Wey
ler has inaugurated is forcing the country
people into the cities, where they are dy
ing by scores of hunger and disease. Many
of the refugees die from exhaustion before
; they reach the cities. The Fernandez fam
| ily, consisting of father, mother and six
! little children, were driven from their
home by Spaniards last week and
the house burned. The family started
for Matanzas on foot. They were
five days on the way, and for
' three days they were without food.
j Four of the children died of hunger and
i exhaustion, and the parents carried the
, little corpses in their arms. On the fifth
| day, when about six miles from Matanzas,
the father, mother and other two children
succumbed and dropped by the roadside.
They were found a few hours later, all
dead save the father, who lived long
enough to tell the story.
Many similar stories reach Havana, but
the above is sufficient to show what hor
rors result from Weyier's policy of burn
ing the homes of the Cubans.
Driven to the cities, the men are com
| pelled to enter the Spanish army. Weak-
I ened by lacK of food these refugees become
eaiy rictims of yellow fever. In the hos
pitals at Matanzas, Havana and Santiago
it is estimated that there are 11,000 yellow
fever and smallpox patients. Of these
about 7000 are Spanish soldiers. The
exodus from the island continues, every
; steamer being crowded.
Official reports show that nearly 50,000
i persons have left Cuba since Weylei ar
â  rived. But these figures do not cover the
| exodus, for hundreds too poor to pay pas
sage have taken refuge on the little Keys
adjoining Cuba, where they are subsisting
on fruit and fish.
CRUSHING SPANISH DEFEATS.
Hundreds Killed and Wounded and a
, . General Taken Prisoner. â 
NEW YOKK, S. ,Y., July 29.â A spec
ial to the Recorder from Key West lays:
The report that reached .here last week
stating that the Spanish forces under Gen
eral Suarez Inclan had been overwhelm
ingly defeated and the general himself
captured by the Cubans under General An
tonio Maceo has been confirmed. Advices
from Havana to-night state that although
the story is still officially denied, there is
no doubt that Inclan is Maceo's captive.
It is stated in Havana that Weyler has
received letters from Maceo announcing
that Inclan is a prisoner . and offering to
exchange him for any prominent Cuban
Weyier may name. Maceo adds : that if
Weyler refuses 'to V make the exchange
Inclan will be held as a hostage, and that
if any prominent Cubans are put to deatn
Inclan will meet with a similar fate.
Inclan's friends are urging Wryler to
agree on an exchange.
' The Spaniards under Colonel Zurgia
have been defeated by the Cubans under
Salvador Rios. The engagement occured
on the Canton - ; River in Eastern Cuba,
The Spaniards lost 130 killed and
wounded. 'Colonel Zugria was among the
wounded. â  Zurgia, in announcing his de
feat, says ,he was â¢ "compelled to retreat
by oTerwhelming numbers." 'V; 5
â¢ At Manzaniilo a bloody riot occurred
because of a Spanish officer's attack on a
city official. Citizens came to the latter's
assistance and the officers called .but the
troops. The troops fired on the civilians,
wounding: fifteen. The feeling is bitter
against the troops and further trouble ' is
feared.

MUST NOT DO IT AGAIN,
Secretary Herbert Disapproves
the Findings of the Webster
Court-Martial.
The Paymaster Will Not Be Removed,
bat Mast Make Restitution
to Tobin.
WASHINGTON, D. C. July 29.âSecre
tary Herbert to-day disapproved, with the
qualification that he must not do it again,
the sentence of court-martial held at Mare
I Island in the case of Assistant Paymaster
j Webster of the navy, who was court
martialed for conduct unbecoming an
officer and gentleman for failure to return
money which he had â  received from his
j clerk, W. J. Tobin, as a bond. â¢ The court
i found him guilty and recommended his
1 dismissal. . â 
The Secretary in reviewing the case
points out the errors of the court in ad
mitting certain evidence, and concludes
as follows:
"If the accused is entitled to every
doubt which may reasonably arise from
! the evidence, and if the benefit of that
doubt in to be accorded him in considera
tion of every portion of the evidence,' then
it is fair to assume that W. J. Tobin and
Paymaster Webster both treated this
transaction as a loan. They are presumed
to have known its nature, and in the
light of these facts and circumstances it
cannot be assumed as proven that when
Paymaster Webster asserted in his letter
to the Navy Department that this trans
action was a loan and was in no sense a
bond he was guilty of a deliberate false
hood.
"The language of the original receipt
given by Paymaster Webster for the $2500.
it is forcibly argued, sustains the conten
tion of the prosecution that the money
was received on account of deposit of W.
J. Tobin. This is undoubtedly the natural
signification of these wordsâ that it was a
deposit for W. J. Tobinâ meaning that it
was security for his conduct as a clerk,
but such a receipt as this is legally ex
plained by parole evidence, and, like every
other contract, is to be interpreted in the
light of surrounding circumstances.
"The receipt given at Shanghai on ac
count of the loan is so strong to show that
two of the parties to this transaction
treated it as a loan that the department
feels impelled to declare that this case is
not made out beyond reasonable doubt.
No matter what the original contract
shows on its face; no matter what may be
its legal significance â the issue here does
not arise upon the tree interpretation of
that instrument. The question is, How
did Webster understand it? If he under
stood it and treated it as a loan, it cannot
be affirmed that he is guilty.
"Toe transaction, however, it mnst be
said in conclusion, is in any sense in
which it may be viewed disgraceful to Pay
master Webster and to the nary. It would
seem to have been a violation of tne spirit,
if not of the le'.ter, of section 1781 of the
Revised Statutes, prohibiting any officer of
the Government taking money or other
consideration for procuring an appoint
ment.
"But however that may have been, it is
scandalous that Paymaster Webster should
fail to pay back at the termination of the
services of Tobin money received by him
in consideiation of Tobin's appointment
aa clerk, and should ha for sny great
length of time in future persist in this
failure, the department may be expected
to proceed further in tnis matter. The
failure hereafter to pay this money will
be a new and distinct offense not covered
by anything which has occurred in the
triaL
"For reasons herein stated the proceed
ings, findings and sentence of the court in
the foregoing case are disapproved.
Passed Assistant Paymaster Webster is
released from arrest and restored to duty."

Concussion of the Brain Caused

Floor.
CLUB OFFICIALS ARRESTED.
A Knockout Stroke That Landed One
Fighter in Eternity and Another
in Jail.
SALT LAKE, Utah, July 29.â Tom Car
ter, colored pugilist of Tucson, Ariz., has
fought bis last battle. He lies dead at the
morgue, the result of a knockout blow de
livered by Bob Thompson at the Salt Lake
Athletic Club rooms last night. Thomp
son is a colored pugilist of local repute,
and was matched to fight Carter to a finish.
The clubroom was crowded with a repre
sentative throng, and tbe fight was a severe
one. Carter told his brother at the end of
the tenth round that he was unable to
finish, but his brother told him to go in
and win.
Near the end of the twelfth round
Thompson had been getting in some
telling blows, which Carter was unable to
ward off. Suddenly Thompson swung his
left and landed with terrific force on
Carter's ri^ht jaw. He fell like a log, his
head striking the floor with great force.
He never rose and never regained con
sciousness. Doctors, sporting men and
his opponent stayed with him all night,
but he died this morning from concussion
of the brain. As soon as the fighter died
the arrests for his murder followed.
Among those taken into custody were
Thompson and the seconds, Bob Houston,
Bud Foreman, Roy Condie and Kia
Smith. Others arrested were James B.
Bloor and Thomas Homes, officers of the
athletic club, and James Dixon referee, all
of whom gave bonds and will be tried on
Monday.
Carter has a record on the coast. In
1890 he whipped Grant Douglass, Jack
Turner, Pat Sullivan and Billy Graham in
Los Angeles. "Happy Joe" Jones went
down before him in San Francisco in 1892
and latter Harry Wood was whipped in
Oakland. He beat Bert Johnson, "Big
Bob" Dodds and Jack Coleman in Sacra
mento.
Bloor, the president of the club, is edi
tor of the Argus ana a well-known news
paper man. The attorneys for defendants
are confident of an acquittai.
The death of Carter is similar to the Dal
Hawkins-Miller fight in San Francisco
some years ago, when tbe latter was
killed.

Make Three Miles in Double SeulU in
Very Fast Time.
HALIFAX, N. S., July 29.-To-day's
aquatic eveDts were even more successful
than the first day of the summer carnival.
The three mile race in double sculls, which
was the most important one of the after
noon, started about 6 o'clock. There were
three pairsâ Gaudaur and Rogers, Bubear
and Barry, Durnan and Hackett. The race
was between two of the pairs and was a
fine spectacle until the turn was reached ;
then it lapsed into a procession in which
Gaudaur and Rogers held first position.
The Englishmen, Bubear and Barry,
caught the water just a little ahead of the
otherH at the start and pushed ahead,
but they were unable to maintain tbe ad
vantage very long. Gaudaur and Rogers
worked hard. They were pulling a 37
stroke and the British pair put In about
one more stroke to the minute, but the
slower stroke was doing the best work, and
inch by inch the Canadian champion and
his American mate were drawing away.
They finished in B:43'Â£ amid cheers of the
spectators and the blowing of whistles.
Ihe Englishmen reached home just 38U'
seconds behind them.

BANDIT'S TRAIL
Outlaw Meyers' Accomplice
Seen Near the Scene
of His Crime.
THE DEAD UNIDENTIFIED
-Officials Erred in Claiming He
Was Theodore Winters'
Stepson.
. SHERIFF DOUGLASS BUHIED
<. Oq Gitixens Will Contribute- to a Fund
for the Brave Man's
Widow.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., July 29.â The
dispatch sent out from here last night
stating that Â«Meyers, the outlaw killed by
Sheriff Douglass, was' a stepson of Theo
dore, Winters, was decidedly erroneous. It
is probably a case of mistaken identity, as
it appeals that Mr. Winters.never had a
stepson. His son, George Winters, is now
about 45 years of age, and has resided on a
ranch near A madee, Larsen County, for
many years. He is highly spoken of by
all who are acquainted with him. If it is
no t, as most persons here believe, a case
of mistaken, identity, the coupling of the
dead bandit with the name of Theodore
"Winters is a most malicious proceeding.
Every eftort is being made to clear away
the mystery and trace the story to its
origin.
It is possible that Meyers had been mas
querading as an adopted son of Theodore
Winters, and that this led to the injustice
to George Winters.
Walter JLOvelady and William Pascoe,
the latter a brother of Under Sheriff Pas
coe, who went out in company to trail the
outlaw supposed to have been the accom
plice of Meyers, and who killed Sheriff
Douglass ofter Meyers was shot, returned
to this cky last night, having been out
since the finding of the bodies Monday
morning.
They had traveled over considerable ter
ritory during the past two days, and-Love
lady t) being an experienced trailer, had not
overlooked anything on his trip that
would assist in the search for the fugitive.
From inquiries made of different persons
he came to the conclusion that the dead
robber had a partner beyond all doubt.and
that the man. bad been seen by several
persons before and since the tragedy.
Ths roah suspected of Deing the criminal
is of .medium size, dark comolexion, dark
hair, father dark mustache and slightly
btoop-shouldeVed.
City Marshall Getchel^while hunting for
tne fu&itiv* bandit yesterday,- met Love
â  lady and Pascoe about three m.iles frem
: town. 'They" had been over the country to
CherÂ«kee and North San Juan in one direc
tion and were coming home by another
rout*. â  â¢
Â°- . Xhe three* men remained together for a
While, and then stationed themselves- at
. ââ¢ points of advantage and watched the sur
" rounding country. They were rewarded
by seeinc, passing through the woods, a
â jjian who resembled the one they were
looking 'for. They trailed him for some
time, and became satisfied that be was
making for the spring near which the
bodies of Sheriff Douglass and. the robber
Meyers'werd found.
It was late when they reached town.
Not Jong afterward, Marshal Getchell
was informed that a man answering the
description of the fugutive ha.d been seen,
passing through the outskirts of town
about, 6 'o'clock that -evening. â  He carried
a roll of blankets, and was evidently avoid
ing the business section. The Marshal at
".once telephoned to the officers at Grass
Valley and other points to be/on the look
out fgr this fellow.
It was learned this morning that a
\ â¢ stranger, -supposedly the same one, was
seen on the Sugar Loaf grade, not a mile
4rom the "scene, of the tragedy, between 5
Â° â¢ and 6 o'fclock last evening. He was sitting
by the roadside reading a newspaper, and
had a bundte of blankets with him, when
. totistable Northup and Supervisor Woods,
both of North San Juan, drove along.
â¢ Northup was so impressed with the idea
that the stranger was the other highway
man that be got out of the Duggy and was
on the point of going back to arrest him.
Woods urged him not to do so, as he said
it was highly improbable that the outlaw
'â¢ would remain so near town after the
crime. Northup then got into the buggy
and they drove on. At the bottom of the
grade Northup determined to go back
anyway and arrest the man. The team
â¢ was turned around and after proceeding a
short distance they met the man coming
. toward kown, with his blankets on his
back. This apparent indifference on the
part o.f the stranger caused the Constable
oto conclude that he was mistaken, and the
team was turned ground again and driven
into town: It is supposed that the man
came down E^st Broad Btreet until
Orchard street was reached, went up the
latterÂ°street to West Broad street and then
to Spring street, down which he parsed
when last seen. An honest stranger
would not take such a round-about way to
get out of town.
Marshal Getchell and others were out
to-day looking for him. It is supposed
that Ire is making for Marvsville, or that
possibly he went toward Colfax or some
other point on the railroad.
Detective Thacker of Wells, Fargo &
Co. and o Sheriff Conroy of Auburn are in
town. They came up to attend the
funeral of the Jate Sheriff Douglass. This
morning, accompanied by Deputy Sheriff
â¢ N eagle and Policeman Gibson of San
-Francfsco. they visited the spot where the
tragedy was enacted. The ground and the
surrounding premises were closely exam
ined for clews and for facts upon which to
baseÂ°a reliable theory. It is the opinion
of the officers that Douglass was killed by
a confederate of the dead robber, who was
in the brush, and, hearing the shots that
killed Meyers, came out and began shoot
ing at the Sheriff; that the officer fired at
the robber, and while his arm was ex
tended received the wound in his hand,
which caused MÂ«n to drop his pistol.
Being disabled and unarmed, Douglass
turned to flee and was shot in the back
and kyied. This is a plausible theory.
The funeral procession that this after
noon " followed the remains of Sheriff
Douglass to their last resting place in Pine
Grove Cemetery was over a half mile long.
More man 500 people were present from
lirass Valley. The funeral address was de-
Jivered by J. T. Howard, a former min
ister and a particular friend of the de
ceased.
A movement has been started to raise a
fund for the purpose of erecting a monu
ment to the memory of the late Sheriff,
and subscriptions have already been of
fered. It is suggested now, in view of the
fact that Sheriff Douglass left no estate,
that a fund be raised to be presented to his
family as a testimanial to his bravery and
efficiency as an officer and his honor and
worth as a citizen. The latter project will
meet with hearty approval.
PECCULIAR IS ASTER.
Electrio- Car Strikes an Oil Wagon With
Serious Jtrstiltt.
DETROIT, Mich., July 29.â A Mount
Clements motor-car struck an oil wagon
on Gratiel avenue this morning, demolish
ing it, and seriously injured the driver,
John Donlon. The oil spread over the
pavement, and the next car which passed
over the spot ignited it. In a second the
street was ablaze. A butcher wagon
standing near was surrounded by the
flames, and the driver was severely
burned before he could escape. The horse
was nearly roasted alive, and had to be
killed. Gertie Young, a 10-year-old girl
who jumped from the car, struck on her
head, and is severely injured and burned.
A boy named Thieifs, whp also jumped
from the car, was slightly injured. Henry
Trapp, a fireman, was thrown off a hote
cart and had his collarbone broken and
was otherwise injured. The flames were
subdned before they could spread to ad

Hare Ao Power to Oire Away Exclusive
nights to Street:
LANSING, Mich., July 29.â A matter of
much interest to citizens of municipalities
troubled with Boards of Aldermen inclined
to be very generous to corporations has
been decided by the Michigan Supreme
Court. The Detroit City Railway Com
pany, several years aeo, was granted a
franchise covering many streets, and, fur
thermore, requiring that all street-railway
franchises should be offered to the before
mentioned company before going to any
other.
The Citizens' Railway Company of De
troit, recently formed, sought to enjoin
the older company from perpetually using
the streets under ihis.francbise. The case
was carried through the lower courts, and
the Supreme Court decides that a common
Council has no power to give away exclu
sive rights to streets.

A THRILLING EXPERIENCE
Sailboat Upsets and a Party of
Five Is Thrown Into
the Water.
All Finally Reach the Beach After Bat
tling With the Waves Over
an Hour.
BT. JAMES, L. L, July 29.â Willie Col
lier, the actor, and three friends, Wi.'l
Warren, John Hines and Thomas Adams,
went on a fishing expedition Monday in
a small sailboat with Dick Mullen, a friend
of Collier. The boat settled pretty well
into the water when the party of five got
on board, but they started nevertheless.
After fishing some time the wind fresh
ened and kicked up quite a heavy sea.
The anchor was raised and the boat's bow
turned shoreward. Tney had not gone
far when a heavy gust of wind struck the
craft and she went over. The five men
were thrown into the water and the boat
drifted beyond their reach.
Mullen, Collier ai.d Warren are expert
swimmers, while Hines and Adams could
not swim. The three swimmers took turns
encouraging and holding up the other two,
and meantime managed to divest them
selves of most of their clothing.
It was a battle for life. Collier, Mullen
and Warren had all they could do to hold
up Hines and Adams. Their progress was
very Blow, and it was over an hour before
the party reached the shore. All rive were
thoroughly exhausted. They lay down ou
the beach to recover their strength. They
were discovered there by a man residing
near by, and he managed to collect suffi
cient old clothes to enable the ship
wrecked fishermen to return here.

WEDDING BELLS
AT SAN RAFAEL
Nuptials of Miss Alice
Gerstle and J. B.
Levison.
PICTURESQUE CEREMONY
A Fete Champetre Elaborate
and Perfect in Every
Detail.
COLTJMHS TRIMMED WITH IVY.
Wedding Breakfast Spread Beneath
the Redwoodsâ Chic Toilets
of the Ladies.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., July 29.â Miss
Alice Gerstle, daughter of Lewis Gerstle
of the Alaska Commercial Company, and
J. B. Levison, marine secretary of the
Fireman's Fund, were married to-day at
noon at the Gerstle place. Rabbi Voor
sanger of the Temple Emanu-El performed
the ceremony.
Picturesque in all the details were the
preparations for the wedding. When
Miss Gerstle set the day that should see
her united to the man of her choice she
decided on an out-of-doors ceremony, and
personally planned all cf the arrange
ments in accordance with her ideas of what
a country wedding should be. The octa
gonal pavilion made an ideal bower for a
wedding ceremony. Pink net studded
with pink geraniums and hydrangeas hid
the rafters. Wreaths of the same pretty
pink blossoms were suspended by long
drops of pink ribbons at irregular inter
vals. From here and there swung rustic
baskets filled to overflowing with fragrant
blossoms. The pillars that support the
bower were twined with pink silk and
wreathed in ivy, thus carrying out the
prevailing taste of all the decorations â
pink and green.
The guests who came from San Fran
cisco left the city by the 10:15 o'clock
boat in the morning, and on their arrival
were met by carriage* which conveyed
them to the home of the bride.
By noon all was in readiness for the
ceremony which was to unite the young
couple. To the strains of the bridal
march, which came wafting in from
around the redwood grove that surrounds
the Gerstle place, the bridal party marched
past the house along a carpeted path to
the flower-decorated pavilion. First came
the bridesmaids, Miss Alice Greenebanm,
Miss Alice Greenwald, Miss Sadie Hecnt,
Miss Alma Levison, Miss Clara Joseph
and Miss Helen Schweitzer. Following
the march came the maid of honor. Miss
Bella Gerstle, who in turn preceded the
bride, who walked to the improvised altar,
leaning on tne arm of her father. The
ushers, Dr. Charles G. Levison, Louis
Greenebaum, Marcus C Sioss, Joseph
Sloss, William Gerstle and Leon Greene
baum, followed in the rear, closing tne
bridal procession.
Mr, Levison, attended by his best man,
A. H. Small, awaited in the floral bower
the arrival of the bride.
After the ceremony the young folks
were immediately surrounded by their
many friends present, who proffered their
congratulations. At 1 o'clock an elaborate
breakfast was served at small tables ar
ranged od the wide piazza that surrounds
the picturesque home. Six persons were ac
commodated at each tab>e, with the excep
tion of the bride's, at which was seated all
of the bridal party.
The bride wore a gown of satin, com
pletely hidden with an overdress of finest
white crepe lisse. The jupe was a mass
of deep Valenciennes insertion edged on
either side with tiny finely plaited
flounces.
The corsage was made with a yoke of
Valenciennes, under which gleamed the
fair white skin. The sleeves were small
and composed of countless, tiny flounces
trimmed with lace. A sash of taffeta cir
cled the slender waist and fell in showers
almoat to the hem of the gown. A wreath
of orange blossoms confined the bridal
veil to the coiffure and lilies of the va'.lev
formed the bridal bouauet.
Miss Bella Gerstle, the maid of honor,
wore a modish gown of white organdie
over white silk. A large white hat with
wuue flowers completed the costume.
The gowns of the bridesmaids were
dainty creations of white mull over green
silk. A taffeta sash and collar of a cor
responding shade finished off the cos
tume. The hats were large legjorn pic
ture hats and were ornamented with white
tulle and American Beauty roses. Their I
bouquets were composed of long stemed I
American Beauty buds tied with long satin !
streamers.
The bridal presents, which were elabo
rate, numerous and costly, were placed on
exhibition in the library. They were
greatly admired, especially the vast
amount of elegant silverware and artistic
and unique articles of vertu.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., July 29.â
One of the tnree men who participated in
the Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek
stage robbery last Thursday was captured
by a deputy sheriff while leaving a Denver
train at this point Monday morning, but
for reasons unknown the arrest has been
kept a profound secret. Immediately

THE IRISH LAND BILL,
Passes Its Third Reading in the
Commons and Its First
in the Lords.
Unsatisfactory to Redmond and Dillon,
but an Improvement on the
Existing Law.
LONDON, Eng., July 29.â The Irish land
bill was taken up on its third reading in
the House of Commons to-day.
Right Hon. Arthur Smith-Barry, a well
known Irish landlord, who defeated the
National League in its great tenant fight
at Tipperary, moved that the measure be
rejected owing to the concessions that had
been made to the tenants by the Govern
ment.
Colonel Saunderson, Conservative, who
is also an Irish landlord, seconded the
motion.
John Redmond, Parnellite member for
the city of Waterford, said that the bill
was far short of granting tenants their
rights, but was an installment of justice.
John Dillon declared that as a settle
ment of the land question the bill was a
failure, but it improved the existing law.
Right Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, as the
Government leader in the House, defended
the bill. He contended that it remedied
admitted defects in the law, and said it
would cut to the roots the agitation in Ire
land. The purchase scheme was intended
to foster a desire in tenants to become
owners of land by lessening the pecuni
ary burdens attached to the acquiring of
holdings.
Mr. Smith-Barry's motion to reject the
bill was then voted on and defeated. The
measure then passed its third reading
without a division being taken. It will
now go to the House of Lords.
The bill was presented in the House of
Lords at 5:30 this evening and passed its
first reading.

SAN LUIS' OLDEST MAN.
Narcio Sebastin, 96 Years of
Age, Travels to Santa Rosa
in a Wagon.
Exhibits a Present From His Mother,
Who Has Seen Six-Score
Winters.
SAXTA ROSA. Cal., July 29.â Karcio
Sebastin, who is 96 years 6f age, but hale
and hearty, arrived in this city yesterday
from San Luis Obispo, traveling all the
way in a one-horse wagon. He was just
one month in making the trip, and says
that the outdoor life makes him "feel like
a young man of 75."
The old man camped along the road
during his long journey, erecting a tent
each night over his wagon to sleep in and
cooking hia meals over a camptire. He
will spend a few days at the residence of
Mrs. Luiu Carrillo, a daughter of the late
Julio Carrillo, and then continue his jour
ney to Healdsburg.
Judge John Brown of this city said to
day that he knew Mr. Sebastin forty years
ago, and , that he was then an old man.
he was, therefore, greatly surprised to
learn that he was still alive and well. To
a correspondent, Mr. Sebastin confided
the fnct that he was born in Canada in
ISOO, and arrived on the shores of San
Francisco Bay when 11 years of age, hav
ing Deen kidnaped lrom his home. He
then startled the interviewer by telling
him that his mother was still alive, at the
age of 120, and was living in a convent in
Canada. He supplemented this by show
ing a pair of woolen stockings that his
mother had knit for him and sent as a
present on his ninety-sixth birthday.
Many old residents verify this statement
regarding the age of the old man's mother.
A KERN COUNTY TANGLE.
Reductions in Southern Pacific Assess-
ments-May Be Proved
Illegal.
BAKERSFIELD. Cal.. July 29.â 1n
making up the records of the Board of
Equalization to-day Clerk Evans made a
strange discovery. Two petitions were
filed before the board for a reduction of as
sessment by the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company and under both certain re
ductions were made. As a matter of legal
fact the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany ownsihelands in this county granted
to it by Congress and that is all. A reduc
tion was made onthese lands.
The second petition was for a reduction
in atseftsmenton certain track mileage and
personal property and this, too, was made
out in the name of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company. But that company is
not the owner of this property.
â¢ The legal owner is the Southern Pacific
Company, an entirely distinct organiza
tion from the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company.
A reduction of $18,000 to $20,000 was
made in the assessment on tUe mileage
under this petition, but Clerk Evans be
lieves that it is not legal to grant such a
reduction to a company on a petition filed
by another company. He has telegraphed
to District Attorney Fay, who will come
home at once to attend to the matter. It
must be settled immediately, as the books
must be in tne Auditor's hands by the Ist
of August.
It is said that Assessor Scott knew of the
error when the matter was being argued,
but did not consider it was his business to
call attention to it.
KINIA CREZ CONVENTION.
Christian Church Delegates Begin Their
Deliberations.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal.. July 29.â The con
vention of the Christian church opened at
Garlield Park tabernacle this rooming
with prayer by Rev. J. W. Kelcey of Loni
poc. The first business of ttie session was
the annual address of 'he president of the
State board, Rev. J. E. Demon, in which
he recounted the difficulties of the year
and the triumphs in the home field. He
suggested a more universal financial
method in the general work and indicated
that the outlook of the cauÂ«e is pros
perous.
R. L. Mcriatten, State evangelist, pre
sented a detailed report of his work in the
weaker churches and the mission points.
Under his own labors alone there had been
239 accessions to the church; 131 pupils
bad been added to the Sunday-schools;
I Endeavor societies organized with a
membership of 122 and 319 sermons
preached. He had raised $C4U3 in the field
for local work.
The 11 o'clock sermon was preached
by Rev. B. B. Butler of San Jose. Then
followed the election of a board of direc
tors to have charge of the missionary
property of the church and control the
State evangalist, Bey. A. M. Elston, Rev.
Joseph Albright, Hon. E. A. Bridgeford,
Mrs. Ada Van Pelt, Lyman McGuire, Dr.
B. F. Clark and J. A. Brown were chosen.
Ihe reports of the financial secretary
and the treasurer showed a Lealthy finan
cial condition.
Sun Diego Warrants Jtrj feted.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 29.â A1l out
standing warrants of the San Diego School
District, aggregating several thousand
dollars, have been rejected by County
Treasurer Thompson, acting upon advice
ot the District Attorney. It is claimed by
the Treasurer that tue legality of the
Board of Education has never been estab
lished, nor has the legality of th* Board of
three Trustees elected a few months ago,
to prevent persons opposed to the Board
of Education from interfering with the
affairs of the district. Suit will probably
be brought to compel the Treasurer to
honor the warrants.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1896.
SALINAS GETS A
SUGAR FACTORY,
Claus Spreckels' Generous
Proposition to the
Citizens.
ASKS FOR NO BONUS.
Will Build the Plant if the
Farmers Will Supply the
Beets.
THEY ARE EAGER TO ACCEPT.
The New Structure to Be the Largest
of Its Kind in the
World.
SALINAB, Cal., July 29.â Claus Spreck
els, the sugar king of the world, has been
here lor the past two days investigating
the beet-sugar industry of this valley with
a view to locating a sugar factory at this
place. Mr. Spreckels never does things
by halves, and he has determined upon
building a factory with a daily capacity of
3000 tons, which will be double the capac
ity of any other factory in the world.
Mr. Spreckels has made a thorough in
vestigation of the sngar-beet industry and
there is no one in this country to-day who
understands the subject so thoroughly as
he. The sugar-beet industry of California
owes its birth and success to his energy
and ability.
Mr. Spreckels assured the people of Sa
linas and the farmers of this valley to-day
that if they would agree to supply the
beets he would build his new factory here.
The citizens have awakened to the im
portance of securing such an enterprise,
and nothing but praise for Mr. Spreckels
is heard everywhere. He asks no bonus,
no land; he will build the factory if the
farmers will raise (he beets, and com
mittees have been appointed to interview
the farmers and get their promise to de
vote the necessary acreage to beet culture,
which they will eagerly do.
Salinas people already feel that the fac
tory is theirs and are willing to do all in
their power to aid Mr. Spreckels in
making it a successful enterprise.
PLAINT OF RAILWAY MAGNATES
Equalizers Asked to Assess the Southern
Pacific for Atlan* : " and Pacific
Property.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., July 29. -The
Southern California Railway and the At
lantic and Pacific Railroad system had
their innings before the State Board of
Equalization to-day. Mr. Holterhoff,
speaking for the Southern California',
claimed that its property valuation should
be determined by its financial returns,
and that the earning capacity should be a
criterion.
Holterhoff held that railroad property
as a rule was assessed too high in compari
son with private property.
The following schedule of 1895 was pre-.
sented and a redtiotion of $318,600 in
aiao unt of taxes a* ked : 491 miles of road
in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, River
side, San Diego and Orange counties "
whole value, $2,621,400; expenses, aegre
gate. $1,911,932 51; earnings. $2,257,058 03
-net, $^61,502 39; interest, $282,720; perm a
nent improvements, $0^,205 07: deficiency.
$90,422 GS.
Judge 0, >\ S terry appeared for C. W.
Smith, receiver of tbe Atlantic and Pacific
system, and stated that it had never paid
beyond expenses. While the system be
longs in fact to the Atlantic and facific
the Southern Pacific Company could not
convey litle, and the ownership is ap
parently in the hands of the old company.
Jud?e Sterry said:
1 Wiiat I want to ask the board is to
assess the property to the Southern Pa
cific of the quasi ownership, because the
Southern Pacific really owns the charter
You have the authority. The statute p...
-vides that h road may be assessed to the
owner or who operates it. We right your
assessment on our roliiug-stock because
we return our entire rolling-ttock in the
Territory of New Mexico; but the com
pany want it segregated, as the Atlantic
and Pacific Company pays the taxes to
the Southern Pacific Company."
WINS A FRESNO SUIT,
The Valley Road Acquires Land
on the Depot Site by
Condemnation.
Price Demanded by the Owner Is
Declared by a Jury to Be
Excessive.
FRESNO, Cal., July 29.â The first con
demnation suit brought in this county by
the Valley road resulted in a victory for
the company. James Sutherland had six
teen lots on Q street, on the site for the
depot and warehouse?. He wanted $8000
for the lots, besides $2000 contingent
damages. The suit for condemnation was
brought, resulting in an agreement of the
jury to-uay which fixed the value of the
lots at $2500. The case was hotly contested.
The next suit will be that against D.
Dismukes, who wants $5500 for seven lots
and improvements where the roundnouse
is to be. An effort was made during the
day to compromise, but no agreement
con Id be reached.
As to Valley road progress outside of the
city, the outlook is encouraging. L. A.
Nares of Liverpool, Eng.. agent for a syn
dicate holding an acreage in tlie Laguna
de Tache district, has offered free right of
way through three and a half miles of
that tract. Frank Wilson of the Oleander
Raisin Packing Company has given $100
toward buying rights of way in that dis
trict, and the Oleander Packing Company
has given $500 for the same object.

of the City's Industrial
Progress.
FRESNO, Cal., July 29.â At a meeting
of citizens to-day it was decided to hold
an industrial celebration in this city on
October 8, 9 and 10. It is intended that
the affair shall eclipse any of its kind ever
held in the San Joaquin Valley. It will
be in celebration of the advent of the Val
ley road, the introduction of electric light
and power from the plant in the mountains
thirty-five miles east of the city, the erec
tion of one of the largest wineries in the
State by the California association and (he
industrial progress of Fresno in general.
It is reported that ex-Governor Foraker
of Ohio and Senator Teller of Colorado
will be in the State at that time, and an
attempt will be made to have them come
to Fresno and debate on political issues.
. The county fair and racing events will
be held at the fair rrounds, and the Board
of Bupervisors to-day made an appropria
tion of $300 to be awarded as premiums
â¢n i lSp u ay of country products. There
will also be a grand barbecue and a carni
val queen will reign over the celebration.
The electric company will make a great
display. The citizens have taken bold of
the movement with a will and it will un
doubted ly be a success.

night of a Sixteen- l ear- Old Miss With
a Xeighboring farmer.
COLVILLE, Wash., July 29. â Rosa
Schuntz, a bright young miss of 16, a niece
of John Leipp, a well-to-do citizen, has
eloped with Ed Brooks, a neighboring
fanner. Brooks is about 40 years of age.
The girl had been in the habit of walk
ing to town occasionally during the week
for mail. Some time'ayo Brooks, in a car
riage, overtook Miss Schuntz on the roau
and invited her to ride to town with him.
The young lady accepted the offer and
this passing acquaintance was the begin
ning of a clandestine courtship, which
grew into a ripe affection. There is likely
to be some shooting when Rosa's brother
and Brooks meet. The couple have
ciossed the British Columbian line.

FIGHTING FLEET FUMES.
A Kiaze in a Spice Manufactory Canses
- Considerable Damage. :
The members of the Fire Department
had ;â¢ a novel ; experience whilÂ« â  fighting a
fire on Davis and- Commercial streets last
evening. At 9:30 o'clock a fire broke out
in the third story of the large building oc
cupied by the Merten Manufacturing Com
pany, dealers â¢in I spices, etc., at 210 Davis
street. It made considerable headway and
worked into the fourth floor. By the time
the firemen reached the place the building
was filled with . the smoke and fumes of
burnine and Cayenne pepper, which
drove them back time and again.
The ! poor fellows ' could not work more
tha*n a minute in this ; atmosphere before
being obliged to rush out to the fresh air.
When this condition of affairs was slightly,
overcome by draughts from broken win
dows a ; new element assailed them. The
heat began to burst a large number of bot
tles of ammonia, and the firemen were
bombarded with " flying T glass and the
gases from the liquid were positively un
bearable. â¢â¢â¢' It took fully an hour to put out
the blaze, and the firemen went home with
red noses and smarting eyes. 3SHNH
., M ,S3J cn Â«* loss - and damage was about
$10,000. : >Veil & Brothers, produce-dealers
on the ground floor, sustained I some loss.
How the nre started is not known.
WHAT WILL THE
RAILROAD DO?
On Its Action Will Depend
the Coming of a New
Steamship Line.
ASANO IN CONFERENCE.
The President of the Japanese
Company Making a Close
Investigation.
FLANS OF HIS CORPORATION.
Ready to Bai!d and Operate a Number
of FiYeÂ«Thousan(i"Ton Steamers
Across the Pacific.
On the action of the Southern Pacific
Company will depend to a large extent
whether San Francisco is to be chosen as
one of the termini of the proposed line of
steamships to be operated by the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha from Yokohama to a Pacific
Coast port of the United Btate3.
There was a conference yesterday at the
Palace Hotel between Sachiro Asano,
president of the Japanese Steamship Com
pany, and W. B. Curtis, traffic manager of
the Traffic Association, at which Consul
Koyo and his American confidential
adviser were also present. .These gentle
men were closeted together for several
hours, the conversation relating to the
commercial and transportation situation
of San Francisco, so far as it related to the
project under consideration by the com
pany ot which Asano is the bead.
The latter gentleman is unable to con
verse in English, and the discussion of the
great question at issue was carried on by
means of an interpreter. President Asano,
by his questions* and general method of
investigation, snowed a remarkable fa
miliarity with the local situation. Many
pointed questions were asked regarding
the community of interests existing be
tween the Southern Pacilic Company, tne
Pacific Mail Steamship Company and the
Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany. President Asano wanted to know
who were the stockholders and otiicer* of
these different Huntlngton properties, and
by what particular interest each was
controlled.
| |He also went thoroughly into the advan
tages ot this port from every standpoint,
and the only serious stumbling-block that
he appeared to perceive was the manner in
which the Southern Pacific Company was
tied up to the steamship lines now operat
ing from this port to the Orient. It seemed
impossible for him to comprehend how
his company could expect any encourage
rcent or fair treatment from ilic Southern
Pacific under the circumstances.
In order to make Asano's mind clear on
this point an early interview is to be ar
ranged between him and one of the traffic
officials of the railroad company. This
will be brought about through the me
dium of Traffic Manager Curtie, who will
also be present during the conference,
and who will do all in his power to have
both parties reach a mutually satisfactory
understanding.
"My interview with President Asano
was more in the nature of an advisory
conference than to come to any definite
condition," said Traffic 3lanager 'Curtis
yesterday in referring to his meetine;with
the Japanese steamship company's chief
officer. "I simply laid the general situa
tion before him as ii exists at this port in
tne matter of San Francisco's many ad
vantages as a terminus for his projected
line.
"I am firmly of the opinion that his
company can get a proper arrangement
out of the Southern Pacific Company â one
that will enable it to do business with this
port. In fact, I don't think the Southern
Pacific Company can afford to put any
obstacles in the way of its coming here,
as to do so would be a direct bid tor the
advancement of San Diego as a competi
tor for Asiatic business. As a matter of
fact there are already too many competi
tors for this business at ports other than
San Francisco.
"It is evident that they have not made
any arrangement or come to any under
standing with any other port and that the
matter is still open for settlement.
"The conversation between Mr. Asano
and myself was pujely as to the induce
ments and advantages that would be held
out to his company to come here. The
question was not asked him whether he
would or would not run his line to this
port. I explained the nature of the ar
rangement existing between the present
steamer lines and the railroad for
handling through business, and before he
leaves for New York, which he will do
after he returns here from San Diego, we
will have an interview with the Southern
Pacific people, so that Mr. Asano may
know precisely what terms they will
agree to.
"He has asked for some information
relative to the commerce of this port,
which I shall prepare for him, along with
other tilings the business througti this
port during the la3t three year-?. He also
asked for information as to whether a line
could be operated between Yokohama,
ban Diego and Ban Francisco, witnout
coming in conflict with our shipping laws.
The idea is not to have the company do
any business between San Francisco and
San Diego, but simply between the Jap
anese port and both these California
cities."
The purpose of the visit to this coast
explained yesterday by H. Kobashi
and A. Okawa, members of the party now
at the Palace Hotel with S. Asano! Mr.
Kobashi said:
"Mr. Asano is president of what in Eng
lish would be the Oriental Steamship
Company. It was recently organized with
a capital of $7,500,000 owned by Tokio and
Yokohama capitalists, all Japanese, for,
according to a law in our country, for
eigners are not permitted to take any share
in such business.
"It is the trade we'want more tban the
fine port. Wberever we can make tbÂ«
most that is the place for our terminus.
Yes, if we could get all the trade we would
take it. We know we would have to com
pete. We are willing xo. But wherever
we land on the coast we must have an un
derstanding in regard to transportation
rates with the railroads. The coasting
trade is not very valuable.
"It is a question of great importance to
us, this port business. We most know
what business, what traffic we are going
to get before we decide upon a place, for
when we once come it is to stay. There
will be no withdrawing then.
"We will consider all the ports care
fully.
"The company has not yet built Â«ny
steamers. The intention is to have twelve
steamers of 5000 tons each. Where they
will be built is simply a matter of where it
Is cheapest. The company intends to run
one line direct to Europe by way of the
Suez canal, and another to some port on
the Pacific Coast of the United States.
"Not over 10 per cent of the commerce
of Japan is bandied to-day by Japanese
steamers. The Government thinks that
the national commerce should be in
creased and it is willing to offer a hand
some bonus to each new company. Then,
too, we want to increase our trade rela
tions with the United States.
â¢ "The Japan Mail Company, which runs
seventy steamers aiready, has made a con
tract, we understand, with the Great
Northern Railroad, and will have steam- !
ers entering Seattleâ not six months from â 
now, but next month.
"Seattle is already a Japanese port. We
have been looking at Portlandâ a very fine
placeâ Dut we have not yet seen San
Diego. San Francisco we know all about. I
It is well known in Japan. Tne bar at the
mouth of the Columbia River is not what ;
we had supposed. At low water there is a j
depth of thirty feet, and that is all right, j
"But it is not the port so much â it is tne j
trade. We will go anywhere if the trade ;
v.ill pay. They will probably tell us in :
San Diego thct they have the finest harbor
in the world. That is not the only thing, j
though. It is a purely money-making
proposition with us.
"We are to have more conferences in ;
this City wit h commercial bodies. Yester
day alone Mr. Asano had about a dozen '
appointments that he could not keep, and i
they were all made in advance of his
arrival.
"We shall be here several days yet.
Then for tian Diego,"

tion Committee.
A protest by Miss Agnes if. Manning
was submitted to the board. She pro
tested against the closing of the Webster
Primary School, provided such closing
would mean her transfer to another school
on a reduced salary. The ground taken
by her was that the board had no au
thority to transfer her from a seven teen
class school to an eight-class school, and
perhaps reduce her salary, when sne had
no charges preferred against her to cause
her to forfeit her rights. The protest was
referred to the City and County Attorney
for his opinion on the point therein con
tained. .
Upon motion of Superintendent Bab

c . Slogan jof the Workers in the
â c o c Cause of Republicanism.
At tbe meeting of the prominent Re
â¢ publicans of San Francisco at tbe rooms
of the Union League Club last night there
was organized "The National Republican
League of San -Francisco" in accordance
with the suggestions and plans published
in The Call of yesterday. About one
hundred and. fifty were present, and the
meeting was a most enthusiastic one.
Dan T. Cole acted as chairman and T. H.
Rush as secretary.
The first business was the adoption of
the suggestions recommended by the com
mittee as already referred to.
; Senator" Tirey L. Ford was elected
president -of the club. He made a brief
address, showing the necessity to the
country of the success of the Republican
party in the coming National election,
concluding as follows:
There is but one great" party in this country
to which a confiding people can- look for re
lief at. this time. I Vis not necessary for me to
name that lJatty. Everyone knows the his-;
tory of that organization and what it -has ac-"
compllsned, and under the leadership of
Ohio's favorite ion we must again place that
party in pawer. ='San Francisco must not falter
at this time. Her wage-earners are equally
interested with the merchant and tbe manu
facturer.
On motion of Judge Dibble the president
was empowered to appoint a committee of
five w,hose duty it should 'be to select
eighteen candidates for Vice-presidents â
one from each Assembly district.
Senator Eugene F. Bert, was elected sec
retary; Albert Castle, treasurer.
The committee appointed to select the
yice-presidential candidates was also in
structed to select six candidates to act as
a committee on finance in connection with
the treasurer.
At this, point a recess of fifteen minutes
was taken to allow those present not
already enrolled to become members.
There were already fifty-four members on
the roll, and when the recess was over this
number had been swelled to 126. The full
list follows :

Chairman Ford named the following
committee on nominations: Judge H. C.
Dibble, Sigmund Patton, T. C. Masteller,
E. I. Wolfe and George E. Moore. Hh
announcement that the last-mentioned
gentleman was a nephew of Major Wil
liam McKinley was received with ap
plause. George Stone, W. E. Fisher and
W. N. Abbott were appointed a committee
to select a place of meeting.
B. Fehnernann, under the head of the
good of the party, called attention to the
fact that hard times and corrupt rule in
evitably followed the election of a Demo
cratic municipal, State and National
ticket. He suggested that tbis idea be
promulgated throughout tbe country by a
committee to be known as the "one- idea
committee."
Judge Dibble asked permisiion to em
phasize the position of the newly formed
club. He declared it was not to aid in the
nomination of any man for office, but to
secure tbe election of the candidates put
into the field by the regularly organized
party clubs aud conventions.
C. W. Kyle advocated a campaign of
education among the working people. He
suggested that committees he appointed
which strould be supplied with the right
kind of literature, and instructed to work
among the shops and the other places
where men earn their living by manual
labor. Converts, \&b said, were not made
by holding love feasts; hard and persist
ent missionary work was necessary. His
remarks met with hearty approval.
Supreme Court Commissioner John
Hayne, after calling attention to the fact
that California has always been a gold
EtPte, stated the banks of San Francisco
bad $130,000,000 in gold loaned out on
mortgages. "Even the prospect of silver
legislation." be said, "will force gold to a
premium, and then all these mortgagors
will have to pay tbis premium to get the
gold to pay off their indebtedness. Thus
the burden will fall on the debtor clasi.
There will be two prices to everything one
wants to buyâ one in gold and another in
silver."
Judge Waymire denied that the Repub
lican party was an enemy of silver. He
declared it was in favor of silver, but on a
logical basisâ by ana with the co-oper
ation of the nations with which the United
States does business.
Other speakers spoke of the benefits of
protection, pointing; out that with the re
sumption of industrial prosperity, brought
about by a protective tariff, there would
be plenty of gold and silver for every one.
Adjournment was taken until next
Wednesday evening.
WOMEN REPUBLICANS.
Enthusiastic Meeting Last Night at
Which Telling Speeches
Were Made.
ThÂ« Woman's State Central Republican
Club met in Justice Groezinger's court
room last night.
Mrs. Ballon, president, read the follow
ing communication from Mrs. J. Ellen
Foster of New York, the National presi
dent:
I write a few lines this morning to ask you
what is the effect of the St. Louis platform
on our woman's work in California. Will the
; Chicago platform get many supporters among
Republican women, or" will dissatisfaction
with the St. Louis platform take courage out
of the women so they will be inactive during
the campaign? The Issue will be sharply
drawn everywhere between the present gold
standard and silver monometallism, which
many believe would be the results of the free
and unlimited coinage of silver. I realize
more, perhaps, than the gentlemen that this
is a critical time among California women, ,
and I do hope they will not "sour" on the
Republican party now.
Committees were then appointed for the
entertainment to be given by the club on
August 12.
Dawson Mayer delivered a brief ad
dress. He said that women as well as
men should study the questions of the
day and fully understand the issues of the
hour. Too many men did not understand
the questions and could not, therefore, ex
plain them to women. He complimented
the club on being able to keep order and
upon the attention paid to the speakers.
Attorney H. W. Hutton said this cam
paign with its issues was more to women
than men, for if the right party did not
get into power it would be hard upon the
women, as bo many men were out of work.
Everybody in the State should vote the
Republican ticket.
. Speeches were also made by "Mr. Custer,
Mr. Leavitt and Mr. Stoner. A rising vote
of thanks was extended to the speakers
and to the press, and President Ballon
urged the ladies to work for their friends.
At tbe previous meeting of the club Miss
Marjory McKinley Morse was made an
honorary member and was named the
mascot of the McKinley campaign. She
is the little daughter of Mrs. G. E. Morse,
a niece of Major McKinley.
REPUBLICANS IN LINE,
The Silver Tide Has Turned
and Brings Estrays Back
Into the Ranks.
Fourth District Republicans Will Soon
Name a Congressman, and Din
kelspiel Leads.
Amid tbe early campaign reports from
all over the State which float into the
Republican 'headquarters in rapidiy in
creasing numbers tbe one that is oftenest
repeated in many forms is the one Repub
lican defections on account of silver are
decreasing ana that everywhere there is
noticeable a general tendency among "sil
ver Republicans" to get in behind the
superb leader McKinley and support the
Republican ticket.
â  S. K. Thornton, who visited the head
quarters in the Palace Hotel yesterday
f jternoon, gave one of the latest of these
reports. Mr. Thornton had just returned
from a somewhat extended business trip
through San Mateo, Santa Clara and Banta
Cruz counties, during which he paid par
ticular attention to the political feeling of
the communities in which be stopped.
"I found everywhere a confident feeling
and bright prospects on tbe Republican '
side, 1 ' said Mr. Thornton yesterday. "The !
most noticeable thing which I observed,
however, was that those Republicans I
who in the first outburst of the silver I
craze thought to betake themselves out i
of the Republican party are everywhere :
getting back into the ranks, as they real
ize what the repudiation of the Republi
can party means."
This word is typical of many reports
which reach headquarters by letter
through the State forces and by observant !
Republicans who call at headquarters.
The silver Republicans, even before the
educational campaign has begun, are real
izing that the truest promise of bimetal
lism and the only safe and possible path
to ie are offered by the Republican party, i
the rule of whicb means so vastly mnch <
be-ides to the Nation, and they are stand
ing by their principles, standing by pro
tection and trusting the grand old party
to find the quickest and safest way to the
best financial legislation that wisdom can
devise.
Bank Commissioner J. B. Fuller, who
has been about the State a good deal with- !
in the past few weeks and who has just
returned from his home in Woodland, i
was at the rooms of the Union League
Club last evening, when be stated that his
observations in Yuba and Sutter counties
showed that there were many more Dem
ocratic voters who would not vote for
Bryan and anarchism than there were Re
publicans who are at this early stage
doubtful about supporting McKinley. Mr. I
Fuller found the Republican outlook
bright everywhere.
"If there have been any Republican
doubts about success they appear to have
been in San Francisco," said Mr. Fuller.
"In the country there are no fears for the
party."
The Republicans of tbe Fourth District
will soon nominate a Congressman, though
no definite convention arrangements have
been made. It cannot be foretoid wbo
will run acainst Judge Maguire during
this campaign, so propitious for Republi
can success, but the leading candidate is
now Attorney H. G. W. Dinkelspiel, the
law partner of H. C. Geslord in the firm of
Dinkelspiel & Gesford.
Mr. DinkeiHpiel is in an especially strong
position, because he is a bright, able and
successful man of high character and
wide popularity and because he appears to
be the man to whose support every party
element in this district would warmly
rally.
This promising candidate was two years
ago elected to the Assembly from the
Thirty-ninth District, and his personal
popularity was shown by the fact that he
secured tbe largest majority received by
any legislative candidate of any party.
He has never been a practical politician,
but in a man of culture and bigh charac
ter. His record in the Legislature was
marked oy its cleanness and by bis cham
pionship of the people's cause at every
opportunity. He fathered in the Assembly
the bill for the regulation of the working
hours of barbershops, and he also cham
pioned other labor measures.
Mr. Dinkelspiel is a Native Son, and is
especially popular in this order, in which
he is a past errand officer and an active and
influential worker. He is now president
of the Library and Reading-room" Associa
tion of tbe order in San Francisco, and is
a member of the ball association of tbe
order, in which capacity be took an active
part in the erection of the new Native
Sons' Hall. If nominated, Mr. Dinkel
spiel will make a hard and aggressive
fiarht. and he and his friends are sure that
he ran win the district for Republi- '
canism. '

members were enrolled, making the mem
bership 325. H. H. Williams spoke in in
dorsement of John D. Spreckels and in
behalf of prompt registration and the
Republican cause. Secretary J. J. Feeley
discussed the financial question ably and
A. B. Treadwell was among the other
speakers. The club will adopt a uniform
and become a feature of campaign life.
INDORSEMENT OF LOUD.
Named for Congress by the Central
Republican Club Last
Nlarht.
The executive committee of the Thirty
fourth Assembly District Central Repub
lican Club met last night at Sixteenth and
Mission streets, Charles Mayer in the
chair.
A committee of five, composed of F. J.
Hurst, E. B. Smith, W. W. Whan, Wil
liam Casbman and C. C. Butt, was ap
pointed to make arrangements for a ratifi
cation meeting to be held next week.
The following resolution was offered
and carried unanimously:.
Whereas, The Hon. Eugene F. Loud n one of
the most influential and active members of
Congress from California, as has been demon
strated by his appointment to the chairman
ship of the Committee on Postoffices and
Postal Roads, one ut the most important posi
tions in the House of Renresentatives of the
United States; and whereas, through his
untiring and successful efforts for the improve
ment of our harbor, his diligent and effective
labor for the improvement of tbe postal sys
tem aud his special and productive work in
procuring an appropriation of $250,000 for
restraining-ttams for the hydraulic mines
have endeared him not only to the people of
his district, but to the whole State as well;
and whereas, it has been shown that the
policy of the people of this district In keeping
the Hon. Eugene" F. Loud in Congress for sev
eral terms has been productive of good results
and beneficial to the people of the State,
therefore be it
Retolved, That we, the members of the execu
tive committee of the Thirty-fourth Assembly
District Central Republican Club do hereby
indorse the Hon. Eugene F. Loud as our choice
for renomlnation for Congressman, so that the
Fifth Congressional District and State may be
represented by an experienced, faithful and
energetic servant of the people.
OLYMPIC CLUB BOXERS.
Pugilists Who Are in Fine
Trim for Friday Evening's
Exhibition.
Joe McAuliffe, Who Is to Fight Slavin,
Is Beducing Flesh Rap
idly.
The Olympic Club is now sanguine of
having a big house on Friday evening,
when it will give its second professional
boxing entertainment in the gymnasium.
Director Bhort said yesterday that the
tickets for the entertainment are selling
like hot cakes and- that the club will cer
tainly realize a nice sum from the scheme
to help along the financial end of this
grand athletic institution.
Van Buskirk and Davis are in the pink
of condition and the big Olympic heavy
weight is very confident of putting the
Omaha champion to sleep in short order.
It will surely be a quick and spirited con
test. What promises to be the prettiest
bout of the evening will be a meeting be
tween McArthur and Green. This will be
four rounds and the spectators can rest
satisfied that they will witness a scientific
contest worth going many miles to see.
Butler and Kochette will have a hot
argument for eight rounds, and it can
safely be said ttat the clever bantams,
Mahoney and Smith, will give a rattling
I performance. The Olympic boys are
backing Smith strongly because he is said
to be stronger and a mucb harder puncher
than the man from Sausaliio. Davis is
favorite over Van Buskirk, Rochette is
favorite over Butler and even money is
being placed on the bout between Mc-
Arthur and Green.
The following circular, which is self
explanatory, has been sent by the Olympic
Club's secretary to each member of the
club:
On Friday evening, July 31, there will be
! held In the gymnasium of this club three
! eight-round professional boxing contests. It '
| has been decided to charge the members of i
I this club $1 for rickets to witness thia exhibi
; tion, and to non-members the charge will be
: $ 2 50. In explanation of our course in this j
I matter we have to say that first-class amateur
! talent is almost impossible to obtain, owing to
the fact that the Amateur Athletic Union will
onftv admit of a $35 prize being given, and we
find it very difficult to induce men to train for
weeks at a time and then to contest for a $35
prize. We therefore have concluded to follow
i in the footsteps of all the large clubÂ« in the
, East and give a gentlemen's night, when all
contestants are professionals. Such an enter
tainment will cost about $1300, and in order
to give it we are obliged to charge as luted
above.
For the accommodation of members half of
; the seats will be partitioned off and members
I will be admitted at the main entrance to the
i club upon presentation of their membership
card, accompanied by an admission ticket No
seats will be reserved.
Should this entertainment meet with the
success anticjt>ated similar ones will be given
in the near future. The world's champion,
James J. Corbett, will act as referee.
On Monday evening, August 3. a general
meeting of the club will be held for the pur
i pose of electing a committee of five, who shall
i nominate candidates for office for the ensuing
: term, and their nominees phall be known aa
the regular ticket. Yours respectfully,
Board or Directoks.
Charles J. Bosworih, Secretary.
George Miehling, the club's wrestling
instructor, returned from the East yester
day after enjoying a very pleasant va
cation. Miehiing says that he had not
seen in his journey through the large
Eastern cities an athletic club that seemed
to compare with the Olympic in any way
Peter Maher and his manager will leave
for New York to-day. Choynsk" was
anxious to fight Maber in this City, but
now that the prospect of a contest is
knocked on the head Joseph says that he
is ready to meet the next best man under
the auspices of any club that will offer a
good purse.
Joe McAuliffe is getting into fine con
dition. He has taken off twenty-one
pounds of avoirdupois since he com
menced training and the obe 2 stomach
which gave him the appearance of a highly
conditioned Alderman is fast disappear
ing. The friends of McAuliffe will be
pleased to learn tbat Professor Farley's
protege has still a good chance of winning
fame and coin by whipping some of the
big fighters who are doing more talicinÂ«r
than actual fighting. c
OLYMPIC DIRECTORS.
Corbett Will Referee the Boxing
Contests With One Exception.
The Olympic Club directors met last
evening and tne sole topic was the boxine
tournament of Friday evening. Director
Bhort said that the outlook for a laree
gathering was excellent, and that the
chairs in the gymnasium will be arranged
in sucn a manner that everybody will have
a first-class view of the contests. James
J. Corbett, champion pugilist, will referee
every contest excepting the bout between
McArthur and George Green, which will
be jU'iged by some person selected by the
participants on the evening of the enter
tainment. It is rumored that McArthur
has not a desire that Corbett should act
because be is a particular friend of Green's'
feteve Cassioy has been selected as tbe
clubs official timekeeper. Nothing was
done regarding the applications from the
rowing aunex.

ness.
There was no meeting of the committee
of the whole yesterday morning. There
were only seven Supervisors present when
the time for the session came around and
their sense of the propriety of legislating
on the tax levy stopped short of proceed
ing without any more than a bare quorum.
Supervisor ' Taylor was not there. . Had
he been present the meeting might have
gone on, and in that case the colonel was
primed for a speech which would have
scared ; his brothers in the board. â  He feels
insultedâ deeply insultedâ by the action
of|the board in placing the duties of the
Finance Committee in the hands of the
committee of the whole. Colonel Taylor
the chairman of the Finance Committee'
has been delving into books and papers in
company with a couple .of ' experts in or
der to be ready with a proper report on
the appropriations for the municipal de
partments. For this reason when the
matter was summarily taken out of the
Finance Committee's hands the colonel
felt he and the committee ' had been in- \
sulted. His wrath has been rising all
these days, and by yesterday morning he
had arrived at a point where he could coin
his wrath into words and pour it upon the
beads of his colleagues. But he was not

there, for after tbe meeting of Tuesday
night he decided he would not take a hand
in the morning's proceedings.
When tbe meetin? opened King, Hirscb,
Dimond, Dunker, Morgenstern, Benjamin
and Wagner were present. The Mayor
called the seven Supervisors to order, and
then Dimond suggested that as there were
so few present it were better to adjourn
the meeting of the committee of the whole
until Monday afternoon just before the
board meeting.
King objected to this. He said the
meeting had been called to transact cer
tain business, and that it should be gone
through witb, but the others wore no such
air of bravado, and Supervisor Dlmond's
motion to adjourn was carried. King.
Benjamin and Wagner voted against Di
mond's motion.
Just after the meeting adjourned
Hughes came in, and at once announced
that had he been there he would have sub
mitted a resolution rescinding that by
which tbe matter of department appro
priations had been taken away from the
Finance Committee. But then Hughes
did not arrive in time to present his reso
lution.
It is confidently predicted that when
the Monday meeting of the committee of
the whole is called the committee will de
cide to adjourn to tbe board meeting, and
then, as a ooard, the Supervisors will con
sider the report of the finance committee.
That committee has done all the work on
the tax levy, anyway, and that may be
made an excuse for allowing the objec
tionable resolution to lapse. The mass
meeting of Tuesday night has had an
effect upon the Supervisors, and an inter
view printed yesterday in the Call, one
in which Colonel Taylor made some sen
sational statements anent bribing and
the Supervisors, also had its weight in
tbe meeting which fizzled out yesterday
morning.
When the Supervisors were leaving the
meeting-room they were met by District
Attorney Barnes, who served each with a
copy of tbe accusation filed against the
seven by the Grand Jury.
THE BOY IN A BARREL.
William Watts lit Discharged Through
Lack :>f .Evidence.
The sensational barrel case of North
Beach has ended in smoke, the defendant,
William Watts, having : been discharged
by Judge Joachimsen yesterday.
It was alleged that Watts gagged and
bound George Walker, the seven-year-old
son of W. Walker, 532 Francisco street,
and put him in a barrel, thereafter placing
the top on the barrel with malevolent in
tentions.
Last Thursday . several witnesses gave
their testimony and the boy's lather prom
ised to have more evidence ready yester
day. When the case was called yesterday
be said he had been unable to procure
more witnesses. . ,
The Judge said he had been satisfied
from _ the evidence that a crime had been
committed, but there was not sufficient
proof to show that the defendant was the
guilty party and he would, therefore, dis
miss the case.

ELKCTIOT* >"6VEMBER 3. 1896.
One word "to Republicans: Organize.
As we resolve at mass-meetings soshonld
we vote on election-day. ,
In making the clean sweep for reform
let us begin with our City.
All good business men will find good
company iri Republican clubs.
Democracy has shaken off most of its
leaders, but none of its barnacles.
There used to be some free-traders among
the woolinen, but it is not so now.
Tbe only sure way to get rid of bad Sup
ervisors is to elect eood ones in their
jiaees. â¢ ' /.
The seven may boast that they art* solid,
but they feel a sense of emptiness some*
v.here.
It is a very narrow Populist platform
that can be built on a Democratic foun
dation.
By this time the Solid Seven have
learned what the people are going to do
about it. . o ' ' o
If taxation without representation is
tyranny, what is taxation wfth misrepre
sentation?
The soldier candidate is the one whom
patriotic young men will support with a
true enthusiasm.
Young business men should take a prom
inent part in the Republican canvass, for
it means business.
â¢ The Republican campaign is to begin at
once. Now is the time to join the clubs
and take part in the work.
It is now tbe time of- the tax-shirkers to
call a mass-meeting to indorse the But>er
visors who worked the big suite.
Ii Cleveland has not sunk into a- state of
total collapse we shall hear him reading
the riÂ©t aÂ£t to his Cabinet before long.
It is. hard to satisfy the morbid Demo
crat, who complains that McKinley doesn't
talk enough and Bryan talks too mucji.
.
Altgeid may have constructed tho '
machine, but it 13 more than probable
that Gorman will b6 given the job of run
ning it.
When assessments are made with fla
prant injustice taxation becomp? a cor
ruption to the rich and an oppression to
the poor.
When one man shirks his taxes another
has to pay them, and that is why just men
protest against officials who allow such
practices.
The Populist National organization at
this time rests on Watson alone, and sup
pose Mr. Watson should decide to step
from under?
Republican organization and Democratic
demoralization are going forward with an
equal rapidity, and the campaign pro
presses beautifully.
No Republican should be content to be
an onlooker in this campaign. There is
â¢work in it for every man who has the
energy to undertake it.
Indignation meetings are excellent
things in a way, but we shall nev.er have
uood government in this City until we
have something more to harmonize on
than indignation.
.The integrity of the credit of the Nation
and the protection of the industries of the
people are the two issues for which Mc-
Kinley stands, and what sane citizen will
vote against them?
Bryan's character was molded in debat
ing societies and McKinley's character on
the battlefields of the war for the Union.
Which is more likely to prove himself in
office a true patriot President?
Despite the kick given at Chicago to the
Cleveland administration most of the Cabi
net will support the ticket, and now we
know just how sincere they were in pro
fessing to think Grover was right.
The conquest of tbe Democratic party
by such leaders as Bryan, Altgeld and
Tillman is a nerions danger to the Republic
and every good citizen should give active
and earnest aid in the campaign against
it.
When we are denouncing Dunker,
Hushes, Morgenstern, Wagner, Scully,
King and Benjamin for betraying the
people to the powers of corruption let us
not forget to give honor to Charles L.
Taylor, Joseph I. Dimond, Adoioh B.
Bprackels and John K. C. Hobbs, who
maintained tbe cause of justice and honest
dealing.
THE WOOL INDUSTRY.
Wool production should be a prominent
and profitable industry throughout the
Pacific Coast country, but it is not, and
for very good reasons. In California alone
the loss is enormous because of the Wil
son tariff act It is estimated that tbe
clip this year will show a decrease of
nearly 6,000,000 pounds as compared with
tbe last year of tbe tariff act of 1890, and
unless there is legislation to put a stop
to importations from Australia and other
countries where the cost of production is
so much less we shall not only not pro
duce wool in California for commercial
purposes, but the question of a sufficient
supply of mutton will become a serious
one.
Wool-growers are so isolated from the
highways of trade and travel that people
generally are unacquainted with the im
portance of the business to the coun
try. Under the operation of the pres
ent tariff law we are importing
nearly 125,000,000 more pounds of
wool annually than formerly, which not
only operates to just about cut former
prices in half, but sends fully $18,000,000
abroad to pay for wool that should go to
otir own wool-producers. There are
grades of wool which are not obtainable
in this country and their importation
does not interfere with our home indus
try, but when it comes to importing say
125.000,000 pounds of the kind we do pro
duce at about 50 per cent of the price
our producers should have to make tbe
business profitable, there is not much to
encourage sheep-raising in this country.
Tbe last year of the McKinley act we im
ported wool, shoddy and woolen goods to
the amount of, in round numbers,
$31,000,000, and the importations of the
same kind of articles last -year aggregated
$94,000,000. This makes a difference
against this country of $62,000,000, fully
$50,000,000 of which was not only a net
loss to us, but we had to send gold abroad
to pay tbe bill.
In 1891 wool-growers realized a good
profit on their clip, while the value of
their sheep was $108,000,000. This is put
ting sheep per head at $2 51, which was
the average price that year. In 1895 the
wool clip had a valuation of $26,000,000,
against "$70,000,000 in 1891, and, mean
while, the total value of the sheep of the
country decreased to $67,000,000. In 1891
the average price of wool was 17 cents and
9 cents in 1895. It i 3 very evident that
unless the cause of these decreases in wool
and sheep values is removed it will be a
ruere question of time when the entire
wool industry of the country will be a
thing of the past. It would seem to De
hoove the people of California to bestir
themselves in the interest of the State's
wool industry. Unless reasonable protec
tion is forthcoming in the near future
there will be no sheep on the coast for any
purpose.
THE MASS-MEETING.
The great mass-meeting at Metropolitan
Temple on Tuesday evening will hardly
have much effect upon the gang of seven
on the Board of Supervisors whose con
duct it so severely condemned. Thatgang
has been condemned many times at the
bar of public opinion and has grown
callous in conscience arjd feeling. The de
nunciation of their practices by honest
men affects them now only in their man
ners and not their morals. They swear,
but they do not repent.
The benefit to be expected from the
mass-meeting will be in the effect it pro
duces upon the popular mind and the
influence" it will have in determining votes
in the .coining municipal election. If it
routes the people to an understanding of
the evils- which result from the election of
corrupt officials to office much good will
have been accom-pliehed. For the punish
ment: of evildoers we must look to the
courts. Mass-meetings, however large or
however earnest, can punish no man who
is carele.ss of fair fame or good repute
among his neighbors. They can serve no
good purpose except the one of making
the people resolve 1 to turn down all rascals
at the ne,xt election and raise to office only
those citizens whose tried and tested
probity in private life makes it certain
they will be honest' and true in official
station.
It should "be borne in mind by every
taxpayer tbat a certain sum of money is
necessary every year for municipal pur
poses. If .one citizen is allowed to shirk
his taxes another citizen must pay them.
If property valued at millions of dollars is
allowed by official favoritism to escape the
common tax, then other property must
bear a heavier burden. Unjust assess
ments, therefore, work a double injury to
the community. They induce the rich to
resort to cor-uption in order to escape tax
ation, and they oppress the poor with an
unjust portion of tbe burden of municipal
government. Where iniquity is permitted
the innocent suffer, and all r.urnan experi
ence proves that wherever this occurs it
is always the strong and the powerful that
escape, while the weak are overwhelmed.
It was not by chance that the property on
which assessments were lowered by tbe
gang of seven was that of rich and power
ful corporations. Only ouch powers can
gain favors at the hands of such men. It
is a matter of concern of every taxpayer,
therefore, to elect just men to office. That
fact should be borne in mind from now
until election day. The indicted seven
can be left to the courts. The thing for
the people to do is to elect honest men
next time.
THE OLD DEMOCRACY.
The announcement that Senator Hill is
for a' ticket that shall represent Demo
cratic principles strengthens tbe revolt
against the acts and platform of the Chi
cago convention, but action looking to tbe
calling of another convention had already
been taken by the old Democracy, and a
convention will 6urely be held early in
September to nominate candidates for
President and Vice-President. Of course
no one expects tbat such a ticket would
stand the ghost of a chance to carry the
country, but with the Simon-pure Demo
crat the next best thin* to enjoying the
spoils of office is the keeping of his parly's
fences in good repair. The Democratic
party has a good many able politicians,
but it does not require a very great amount
of political sense to know that if Bryan is
defeated his wing of the party would go
into oblivion and that if he wins there
would be a permanent fusion between it
and the Populist party.
As a political proposition, therefore, an
other convention will have to be held and
candidates nominated and voted for in
order to have a political- organization in
1900. The work of the Chicago conven
tion was theft, pure and simple. The con
vention was packed with anarchists,
Populists, communists and a few weak
kneed Democrats, who captured the name
and the machinery of tbe Democratic
party, but refused to carry off any of the
principles oi the party. It was a case of
stealing the livery of reputable, though
errinc, principles to serve the cause of re
pudiation, confusion and sectionalism in.
The "true blues" are thus driven into
holding anotner convention to maintain
their self-respect In fact it is either candi
dates of their own or rallying to McKin
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1896.
ley, and while it would go against the
grain to vote the Republican ticket it
would not be nearly so humiliating as it
would be to support the despoiiers of their
own party. By holding another conven
tion two very satisfying results would be
obtained. In the first place, such action
would secure the return of the name ana
the machinery of the party to those who
have stood euard over the organization in
tne past, and in the next place they would
have the opportunity to vote for such a
ticket as they would have nominated at
Chicago had they not been deceived by
Populists and anarchists disguised in
Democratic clothing. In view of the plight
in which the "true blues" lind themselves
they have no other way out of the dilemm a
than to hold another convention, for, after
all, it is more desirable to keep free and
unspotted from Bryan ism than to win a
great victory at the polls.
CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS.
However much importance may be given
to the money question in other parts of
the country, in California the tariff ques
tion will naturally and necessarily take
precedence. The industrial resources of
California are as valuable as they are vast
and the progress of the State unquestion,
ably lies on lines that are in harmony
with snch a policy as will encourage capi
tal to engage in the work of translorming
the various kinds of raw material into fin
ished merchantable commodities.
The State is interested in the money
question, nuite as much so as any other
section of the country, but what is wanted
first is opportunity for new capital to open
up new industries, and by opportunity we
mean such governmental protection as
shall assure capital that it will not be
driven to the wall by unreasonable and
unfair foreign competition. The State
needs a very much larger population, but
there must be something to not only make
it to the interest of home-seekers to come
here, but they must be assured that when
once here they will not be obliged to sit
idly by ana Bee the ships of China and
Japan land goods upon oar docks at prices
to compete with which they would have to
accept a reduction in wages equal to fifty
percent or more.
California is in her swaddling clothes as
to industrial enterprises, but she has
everything that is needed but opportunity
to make her an industrial giantess.
The time has arrived when tbe issue of
whatever protection may be needed to un
fold the State industrial possibilities
should be made not only clear and dis
tinct, but paramount to all other Na
tional questions. California must have a
merchant marine, but first let there be
mills and factories to furnish tonnage for
a merchant marine. California needs to
be gridironed by railroads, but there must
be manufacturing centers in different parts
of the State to give freight to haul. There
needs to be scores of interior manufactur
ing and commercial centers, but capital
must first go and offer employment to
labor. California is rich in everything
that is required to make her an empire
of wealth, industry and commerce, but
wbat is the sense of undertaking tbe de
velopment of her resources if there be no
protection against destructive invasion?
Keep the question of the necessity for
protection prominently to the front until
it is secured.
THE COWARDLY POWERS.
It is hard to understand how Christian
Europe could permit itself to be dom
inated by the Turkish Government when
ever the Sultan concludes tbat he wants
no interference in the work of butchering
his Christian subjects. A Turkish Cabi
net Council has just been held, and Greece
notified that she would be held respon
sible for any assistance that is hereafter
given to Crete in the way of permitting
arms and ammunition to be smuggled out
of Greece and into Crete. A parallel case
would be a threat of Spain to thrash the
United States unless public sympathy and
secret aid to the Cubans quit manifesting
themselves.
Right upon the heels of the Sultan's
bold stand the Christian powers joined in
a note to Greece that she must obey tbe
Mussulman butcher, and moreover the
diplomats of Euroue have suddenly with
drawn their sympathy from the Cretans.
With the news of the cowardly backdown
of the powers come accounts of the most
horrible Mussulman atrocities in Oetfe,
Armenia and Macedonia. To their credit
and manliness, be it said, the Cretans re
sent all overtures for peace on the basis of
submission to the I'orte's authority.
It is to be hoped that Russia, as was inÂ«
mated in dispatches the other day, has and
will continue to refuse to co-operate with
the powers to maintain the Turkish Govern
ment, for it certainly means only hostility
toward the Sultan by the Czar, and as the
outcome of such strained relations could
only be a declaration of war, the end of
the Turkish empire may be near. Never
theless, we permit Spain to do to Cuba
what tbe powers allow the Sultan to do to
his Christian subjects, and just at this
time there are no indications that our
Government is going to change its policy
toward the struggling Cuban patriots.

of eighteen inches across, including its claws.
It ruins a large number of cocoanuts by crush
ing the thick shell between its strong mandi
bles after getting a good hold in one of the
eyes of the nut."
It was G. L. Kennedy, a merchant of Nuki
Hivi, who was speaking.and he was entertaining
a few persons at the Occidental with some of
the peculiarities of the islands where he has
lived for nearly five years, and from which he
arrived yesterday with his wife after a forty
flve days' passage in the brigantine Papeete.
He will remain here about a week purchasing
goods.
"But that is not the only pest," he continued.
"We have rats by the hundreds. They climb
the cocoanut trees and gnaw holes in the
young nuts, letting in the water and ruining
them. But flsn; you should see the fish!
Finest you ever ate and in great variety. Oue
in particular, the vara, a sort of shellfish
looks like a centipede, is articulated, lives in
the shallow water of the coral reefsâ well, it is
the greatest eating imaginable. You boil it
and the meat is as white as drifted snow, and
rich. An ordinary vara is from eight to
twelve inches in length and each joint is about
an inch across, if they ever do bring
any to thiÂ» market the epicures will
go wild over them. The Marquesas group is a
French possession. There are about eighty or
ninety islands in allâ many of them very
small. My experience has been that the na
tives pay their debts better than the Euro
peans. Well, the French Government made
them. The chief products of the Islands are
cocoa, cotton, vanilla and sugar. They export
a good deal of sea-island cotton, copra, pearl
shells and vanilla. The sugar is manufactured
for home consumption. It is a good place to
make money, but a poor country for social life.
There are not over twenty-five Europeans on
the whole island where we live."
"The standing army of the republic of Ha
waii consists at present of two companies of
regulars or one hundred men. They are quar
tered in the basement; of the Government
building which it is their duty to guard," re
marked Captain E. O. White yesterday at the
Occidental.
Captain White is himself a military man at
Honolulu, where he has command of one of the
six militia companies maintained and regu
larly drilled in tho island capital.
"The regulars receive the highest pay of any
soldiers in tho world. Privates get $30 a
month, corporals $35 and sergeants $40 and
jj?so a month. Recently the regular army was
reduced to its present size as a matter of econ
omy.
"There is a salaried colonel in command, and
he is at the head of the regiment of which the
six militia companies form apart. He is on
duty all the time in the Government building.
There are no soldiers on the other islands, al
though each Island has what is called the
home guard. These guards on the different
islands have frequent friendly shooting
matches, the results of the target scores being
communicated to each other by mail. There is
no fear of an attack from the royalists, but of
course there is the same talk that has been
heard for a loug time."
"On the average, five men die in our camp
each day," said D. ifuir, who is in charge of a
big refinery in the new oil regions on the
Isiand of Sumatra, woither he will start to-day
on the China with his wife and family, who
came to the Occidental recently from their old
home in Titusville, Pa.
"The trouble is the land is low and level and
a good deal of it is covered with stagnant
water about a foot deep. The weather is hot, the
average temperature ranging from 80 deg. all
the way to 115 deg. Vegetation is rank. We
have 5000 natives, half-castes and Chinese
employed about the wells, the sawmill, the
box factory, the cau factory and the refinery,
which makeup the complete oilplant. Fever
is common and affects the Chinese the wont
of all. They live in such an unhealthy way
anyhow. But we are getting more Chinese all
the time to take the places of those that die off.
"Europeans can't stand the c'imate very well,
either. They stay six months or a year per
haps, and then they have to get away for a
change. I nearly died when I first went down
there, but then 1 got acclimated. I don't
drink, and that makes it easier to stand the
climate. When I leit there in May cholera
was in the camp, and men were going at the
rate of from eight to twelve a day. Well, if my
family can't stand it I'll send them right home.
Everybody talks Malay down there. It isn't
like Chinese. For instance, you count up to
five; it is: Satu, dua, tiga, ampat, lima. Su
matra is bigger than most people think. It
is about 900 miles long, and comes pretty near
being as large as California."
THE MAN WHO WILL.
Though lowly born and humbly bred
Id Poverty 'â  dominion, -.
The man who will may rear his head â
Onward and upward may be tread,
Despite adverse opinion.
If tricky Fortune seem to smile
On many another brighter,
The man oo whom she spends no wile
Should qulckiier pass ouch weary mileâ
â  His knapsack's all the lighter.
With naught to woo his steadfast will
Astray from his ambition,
Sooner should he ascend the hill.
Prepared to win and ably fill
The coveted position. . ' .
.Let none lament that Fate declined
With plenteous gifts to store him;
The man who will may leave behind
The clay he was and some time find
- Life's joyanca spread before him. "

GIRL'S DRESS TO WEAR WITH
GUIMPES.
There is ud daintier or more seasonable
style of dresses for little girls than those made
for wear with lawn or silk guinipes. This
little gown is made with a plain waist, but
toned in the back, the trimming of ruffles
almost covering the body. The skirt is simply
gathered on the waist, and for an apron
would be open In the back and hemmed,
while for a skirt it is sewed up in a seam, leav
ing six inches open at the top for a placket.
A charming little gown ot French challie, in
gray and pink flowers, had ruffles of pink
chiffon and was worn with a pink China silk
guimpe. A more serviceable dress was of
cheviot, In myrtle green, with ruifles of China
silk to match.
Ginghams this year are of the gayest com
binations of colors suggesting rainbows. A
gingham of pink and blue shading into each
other had ruffles of bine gingham embroidered
in pink. A white guimpe was shown with this.
Ruffles of the same goods are used on other
ginghams and on cbambrays. etc. This design
may also be used for aprons. For aprons the
ruffles are of the same colored material*, and
one deep ruffle Is Rometimes used Instead of
the two narrower ones around the neck.
On aprons of ginghams in checks or stripes
of pink, blue, or any color with white ruffles of
white lawn are very dainty. White lawn
ruffles are also used on apron* of heavier white
MUSIC&
MUSICIANS
Joseph Alfred Novello, organist, composer,
scientist and member of the internationally
known firm of Novello, Ewer <t Co. of London,
died at Genoa on July 17. The deceased, who
wm born in 1810, was the Â«on of Vincent
Novello, who established the important
English publishing-house in the year 1811
when in his thirtieth year. The son
Joseph Alfred, at the age of 19,
entered into his father's labors and main
tained the policy of the firm, which
was mainly characterized by the project of
issuing high-class music at cheap rates, with a
judgment and artistic lioerallty which hAve
had a permanent influence on the progress of
music. Vincent Novello's early works had
been limited to the Roman Catholic ritual and
until the innovation made by Alfred the only
printed editions of Handel's oratorios cost $22
each, and this while oratorio was the form,
of music most in use. "The Messiah" can
now be bought, thanks to the Novellos, for 25
cents. Through long years of usefulness
watching the complete development in cheap
publication, and busy with various labors of
science and philanthropy, as well as with
music as an art, Alfred N'ovello lived, and was
loved and respected, in 1856 he retired from
business and left England to establish him
self in Italy.
John Sebastian Bach is going to have a suf
ficiently original monument at Berlin. Wil-
liam II has conoeivod the idea of ornament
ing the Avenue dcs Victoires in Thiergarten
with thirty-two groups of statuary, each one
representing a sovereign, supported by two of
the most illustrious men of his reign. Now
William II has ordered that the statue of Fred
erick 11, the royal composer and flutist, shall
have a general on one side and the grand
"cantor" of Leipsic on the other. It is evident
to-day that the poor musician is much mora
illustrious than the Prussian general and that
Frederick II cannot complain of hav
ing him at his side. But what is J. S.
Bach going to do In this position?
He was not a Prussian subject, he
owed nothing to Prussia, and his short in
terview with Frederick was quite accidental.
J. S. Bach was certainly contemporaneous with
Frederick 11, but what was there in common
between him and the King of Prussia, and by
what right can he De placed as an illustrntion
of the reign of Frederick II? The Menestrel
awaits a reply.
Portugal is preparing to celebrate one of its
glorious anniversaries. It will be in honor
of the fourth century of the discovery of
India by Vasce de Gama, or, at least, of the
route thither by the Cape of Good Hope.
In 1497 the great navigator was ordered
to take charge of this expedition by
King Emmanuel of Portugal, end it is this
important date which the Portuguese intend
to celebrate next year. For this purpose a
grand central commission is being formed at
Lisbon to invite, on the part of artists and
composers, works of a national and other kind,
among others a commemoration hymn, a
triumphal march, a historic drama upon
a patriotic subject, finally a grand
opera or lyric drama on a national subject,
etc. Besides these there will be organized
concerts of ancient Portuguese music and rep
resentations of the ancient national theater.
Probably among the modern operas Meyer
beer's "L'Africaine" will be produced, a.s it
would be difficult to find anything more suit
able for commemorating the glory of the he
roic discoverer of the Indies.
From a private letter we gather that Mrs. Car
mlchael Carr, tbe well-known pianist who has
done so much to foster the love of good music
in San Francisco, is greatly enjoying her vaca
tion in England. She has been to many very
interesting entertainments,' but tbe one she
speaks of as having enjoyed the most was given
by William Nichols, the tenor singer, at Staf
ford House, the residence of the Duto
of Sutherland, which was leut for the
occasion. Among much high-class music, two
songs by Miss Carmichaei, Mrs. Carr's sister,
were rendered, accompanied by the composer,
who also accompanied the other numbers.
Tho Prince of Wales and his family were pres-'
ent, and Mrs. Carr expresses herself as much
astonished at the extreme beauty of the Prin
cess, beside whom her daughters look abso-'
lutely plain, although they are really not so.
Mrs. Carr purposes returning early in Septem
ber, when the popular concerts will be re
sumed.
Cablegram from Bayreuth: "July 20 â
Rheingold mediocre; Walkyrie tremendous.
Attendance and enthusiasm enormous." The
Bayreuth festival began July 19 under the
direction of Hans Kichter, who twenty years
ago led the orchestra at the first production of
the tetralogy. Twenty yean ago Bay
reuth was unknown, except as a sleep y
place, which gave a title to a Margrave
who possessed a castle there. Richard Wag
ner built himself a home In this little
town and called It "Wahnfried, " and in 1872
the foundation of the Festival play-house was
laid, thanks to the assistance of the late King
Ludwig 11, without whom Wagner might have
remained a mute inglorious Milton. On Au
gust 13, 1876, the first performance of the
tetralogy began, before a gathering of imperial
princes, artists, musicians and the Abbe Liszt.
King Ludwig, in solitary state, attended
the first dress rehearsal, but the effect was so
depressing that on the three following days
invited guests were present. A large propor
tion of the visitors this year are foreigners,
among whom the Americans and the French
arc conspicuous. The first cycle ended July
22 with the Gotterdammerung; the second
cycle began July 26, the third will begin Au
gust 2, the fourth on August 9, and the last on
August 16.
A rather good joke is going the round of the
foreign papers: M. Carl Goldmark, the author
of "Merlin" and "La Reine de Saba," one of
the best known German composers, has also
written several symphonic works, among
them a "suite" for orchestra, which
has inspired him w!th a peculiar af
fection, so much so that he takes
it with him wherever he goes. It is stated that
recently he arrived at Saltzbourg for the Mozart
fetes with Conductor Hellmesberger, who
undertook to inscribe their names in the
register of the hotel. For his friend he wrote
"Carl Goldmark and his suite," and until the
departure of the travelers the host waited in
vain for the "suite," ior whom he had reserved
rooms.
The Government of Maarid has issued a de
cree that all theatrical performances must be
terminated by 12:30 henceforth, and that the
abuse of prolonging them till 2 o'clock in the
morning will no longer be tolerated.
This order has been provoked by a grave
scandal which took place at the Theater Ciro
de Colon, on the occasion of the first per
formance of a new opera, "The Great Fair."
The public having energetically protested
against this very mediocre wcrk, the profes
sional applauders (la claque) offered a turbu
lent resistance, and in the end the police had
to interfere.
From Milan it Is stated that Verdi is hard at
work on "The Tempest," or on "King Lear,"
or on "Cymbeline"â at all events on some
thing from Shakespeareâ libretto by Bolto.
Boito's "Nero" is, as happens every year, again
spoken of. Other works announced are Fran
chetti'B comic opera, "Le Malade Imaginaire,"
a "Tartuffe" by Scarano, a "Tosca" by Puccini,
a Japanese opera by Mascagnl and "The
Boheme" of Leoncavallo.
At the jubilee performance of "The Elijah,"
at the Crystal Palace, was one bass-singer who
had taken part in the nrst rendering of this
work fifty years ago, when Mendelssohn him
self conducted. This veteran, Mr. Pountney,
is still in excellent health, and came from Bir
mingham to London to sing on this occasion
and returned immediately afterward. Among
the 23,000 persons present there were many
who bad witnessed the first performance of
"The Elijah."

SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT MONEY.
, New York World.
A correspondent ' asks â¢us , some , questions
which we print here, with a reply to each:
1. Was silver a legal tender for any amount of
debts, public or private, from the beginning of the
Government until 1873? ,
Yes.
i. Is silver only a legal tender to the amount of
â 5 now? %
. No. The silver dollars are full legal tender for
any amount. The subsidiary coins, being pur
posely made light weight in order to keep
change in the country, have been legal tender
only to the amount of $5 since 18&3.
3. Is a silver certificate only a legal tender to
the amount of $5?
A silver certificate is not legal tender at all
It is merely a warehouse receipt. It certifies
that so many silver dollars have been de
posited in the treasury, payable to bearer on
demand. The certificate is not money and not
a legal tender. But its holder can exchange it
for full legal-tender silver dollars whenever be
pleases. ;J ;,â¢'_â¢

IT WILL BE THE ISSUE.
Cleveland .Leader.
Senator Quay said in an interview the other
day tbat he believed the tariff question would
soon come to the front in tbe campaign. Sena
tor Quay is right.
There are millions of people In the United
States who are still determined that protection
shall be restored to the tariff law of the coun
try. The hundreds of thousands of workmen
employjad in the industries of the Eastern and
Middle' States who have suffered untold loss
because of the inauguration of Democratic
tariff reform; tbe thousands of merchants who
have seen their business nearly destroyed by
the blighting effects of the Democratic policy;
the farmers in all parts of the country from
whom millions of dollars have been taken by
the Democratic free trade in woolâ all these
are convinced that prosperity can return only
through a restoration of protection.
Why should not the tariff be an issue? The
Republican platform adopted at St. Louis con
tains a strong declaration in favor of a return
to the protective policy, while the Popocratic
platform adopted at Chicago insists that the
present tariff law is all right, and that tariff
auties should be levied solely for purposes of
revenue. The two platforms define a tariff is
sue, and when once the people become con
vinced, as they are sure to be, that all they
need is the opportunity to work and earn a
living, they will demand that the orators of
the two great parties explain their position
upon the tariff question. Every man who
votes this year for the candidates of the Chi
cago convention will vote for a continuance of
the present ruinous tariff policy, for a tariff
law which, while failing to protect American
labor, also fails to provide sufficient revenues
for the support of the Government.
Protection is bound to come to the front

A Scheme to Make West
ern Fruit-Packers
Suffer.
EASTERNERS INVOLVED.
Baltimore Packers to Label
Their Fruit as From This
State.
A FEW DISASTROUS BESTJLTS
Their Pians Discovered by an Eastern
Agent of the San Francisco
Fruit Exchange.
News has just been received by the San
Francisco Fruit Exchange of what would,
if authentic, be a gigantic fraud perpe
trated on the fruit packers and growers of
California.
The news is in the shape of a communi
cation sent to one ot the members of the
exefiange by an agent located in one of
the Middle Western States. The honesty
and integrity of the writer are vouched for
by the members of the San Francisco
Fruit Exchange. The names of the par
ties to this scneme are known to the offi
cers of the Fruit Exchange, but for certain
obvious reasons will not be given publicity
at this time.
In order to comprehend the wrong in
tended to be done California peaches by
the Eastern packers concerned in the af
fair it is necessary only to print the com
munication, which follows:
I learned to-day confidentially that the Bal
timore packers intend packing a large quan
tity of peaches this season under California
labels, both standards and seconds. One
broker has already taken orders for 4000
cases, subject to approval of samples and
prices, and the buyers have selected their la
bels.'- The cans are to be labeled in Baltimore
and shipped in plain cases, the packer furnish
ing a stencil and the cases to be branded after
arrival at destination.
From the indifference manifested by the job
bers in this State I am inclined to believe
that the Jobbers' Association here, at a meet
ing held, last month, agreed to refrain from
buying any canned fruit futures from Califor
nia. They all talk in the same vein, and say
they will buy the goods next spring or when
they need them, and that the California
packer must carry the goods.
Baltimore packers are also going to pack
sliced peaches and put them on the market so
as to afford both jobber and retailer a good
profit by selling to the consumer at 10 cents.
Secretary T. S. Taylor stated yesterday
that the- parties to the scheme had been
written to in regard to the matter and the
affair will be probed to the bottom. In
case they deny the report steps will be
taken at once to ascertain. its veracity. If
it is found to be true, the matter will be
given full publicity, and the Jaw will be
invoked to prevent the consummation of
the fraud.
"California Backers," said Secretary
Taylor, "generally bear, in mind the
amount of fruit disposed of the previous
year when engaged in packing. If the
Eastern, market should be flooded with
Eastern fruit, purporting to be grown in
California, the local packers would be un
able to get rid of much of their canned
fruit, and great financial damage would
result.
"Then again, the Eastern packers would
have no freight across the continent to
pay, and consequently could Bell their
fruit more cheaply. This would prevent
competition. Besides, for the same reason,
they could export fruit more cheaply than
we. This would be a vast injury to Cali
fornia packers as well as growers.
"If we can prove that this alleged
nefarious scheme exists there will oe
trouble in store for the parties con
cerned."
FORT MASON MURDER.
Preliminary Examination of Private
James Kelly Commenced Before
Judge Conlan.
The preliminary examination of Private
James Kelly of Battery E, Fifth Artillery,
charged with the murder of Private Jo
seph -E. Quinn at Fort Mason on Friday
night, July 10, was commenced before
Judge Conlan yesterday.
Four witnesses were examined and their
evidence was similar to that given at the
Coroner's inquest. Police Corporal George
W. Russell submitted a chart showing the
location of the murder. Private John P.
Jones testified to an altercation In which
Kelly and Quinn participated, and then
Kelly went Dehind the hose-reel house,
following Quinn up.
Privates John Wbalen and John O'Don
nell gave damaging testimony against
Kelly. The former testified that he heard
Quinn say that his jugular was cut and he
saw Kelly walking away. O'Donnell tes
tified that Quinn fell into his arms, saying
he haa been cut Â»nd he was done for. He
asked Qninn who bad cut him and Quinn
whispered "Kelly."
Further examination of tbe witnesses
will be held this afternoon.
MORE PROOF COMES IN.
Advertising Paysâ Paya Promptly, Pays
Wellâ 'What One Ad. Did.
Last Monday morning the California
Furniture Company advertised a "Red-
Letter" sale, to commence that day. No
mention of it had been previously made,
but before noon tne big store commenced
to fill up, and in the atternoon there were
actually more people in the store than
could be waited on handily.
Of course "red-letter" days are pretty
well known to furniture buyers and full
stores are common enough, but it goes to
show that advertisements are read â and
more, that advertisement reaaers are buy
ers.
"Good furniture, quick prices," is the
"short and sweet" way the California Fur
niture Company tells about "red-letter"
days. These words mean more than you
would think from first reading.

PRECINCT REGISTRATION,
T. J. L. Smiley's Expert Opinion
of Its Theory and
Practice.
He Thinks It Will Result in Fraui.
Election Officers Who Are
Not Voters.
"The theory of precinct registration,"
saia T. J. L. Smiley, the Republican rep
resentative, "is all vety well, but the
practice is essentially different. There are
in this City upward of 900 election officers,
not more than one-fifth of them being
qualified electors. The precinct registra
tion this year will, I am sure, be produc
tive of extensive frauds.
"Why, only a small proportion of the
recently appointed inspectors, judges and
clerks of election haa a legal residence in
the City and County of San Francisco and
is entitled to vote. The greater the num
ber of precincts thp wider is the scope
given to fraud. Registrar Hinton is seem
ingly a fair-minded man, but he cannot
control the political consciences of his
numerous subordinates. They, neces
sarily will be influenced by personal and
partisan considerations. I think that all
registration should be conducted at the
City Hall. This, while it would not alto
gether prevent fraud, would greatly lessen
the chances for its perpetration.
"As I have said, many of the recently
appointed officers of election are not
voters, and besides many more of them
are not even residents of the precincts from
which they make their applications.
"There are several important constitu
tional amendments to be voted upon at
the coming election, such as woman's suf
frage, the exemption of taxation npon
mortgages, etc., and these should be given
a prominÂ«nt place upon the ticket. Thus
far the necessary provisions for bringing
these topics before tbe attention of the
people and giving them their proper places
upon the ticket have not been made. The
registration this year is comparatively
heavy, but this is not necessarily any in
dication of fraud, which may be looked for
later in the precincts.
"It is surprising how many men are
anxious to earn the |40 allowed for service
on precinct boards of registration, and to
what length they will go in securing such
appointments. Political parasites and
men around town without any visible
means of support will file applications for
positions with the Registrar and swear
that they are electors of the City and
County of San Francisco and residents at
the Lick House or some ether fashionable
hotel, when in truth they are neither
one nor the other. I trust that by the ex
ercise of due vigilance we shall be
able to detect and prevent all election
frauds which may be attempted during
the coming campaign, and to secure to
the people a fair count and an honest ex
pression of the public sentiment."

NEWS FROM THE
OVERDUE FLEET,
Several Vessels Arrived
Safely in Port Yes
terday.
LIGHT WINDS DELAYED
The Abandoned British Ship
Gowanbank Sighted by the
Loch Linnhe.
WAS DESERTED MOHTHS AGO
Captain Anderson of the Oceania
Vance Has Been Superseded by
Captain Dart.
Several overdue ships arrived in port
yesterday, and all reported light baffling
winds. The first to get in was"the British
ship Loch Linnhe, 160 days from Ham-
burg. Only one accidentjhappened during
the voyaee. On March 25 last William
Brown, an A. 8., fell from the mizzen top
and fractured his skull. He lived for an
hour, but never regained consciousness.
Captain Cummings spoke quite a fleet of
ships. On April 8, in latitude 39.40 south,
longitude 53 west, the Brituu ship
Lathom, from Swansea for Ban Francisco,
was spoken. The Lathom has since been
reported as having put into Valparaiso for
water. She had on board the crew of the
British ship Gowanbank, which was
abandoned off the Horn. On- April 22, in
latitude 55.50 south, longitude 6J.30 west,
anfabandoned four-masted iron ship,
partially dismasted, was passed. This was
probably tbe Gowanbank. which has now
been drifting about the Horn for months.
On the same date that the abandoned
ship was passed, the ships Fulwood and
Gulf Stream were sighteu oft Staten
Island. They were making good weather
of it and shonld reach purty in safet.
The schooner Martha W. Tuft reached
port soon after the Loch Linnbe. She
was forty-eight days making the run from
Tres Marias, Mexico. About a fortnight
| ago tae vessel began to run out of pro
i visions and everybody was placed on short
i allowance. Fortunately the bark Albert
from Honolulu came along, and Captain
Griffiths supplied the Tuft with eight
days' supplies. Captain Olsen of the
schooner reports that it was nothing but
a drifting match from Tres Marias to San
Francisco.
The barkentine City of Papeete made an
unusually lone passage from Tahiti. She
was forty-five days making the run, and as
she is supposed to leave again on tbe Ist
of August with the French mail there will
be a scramble to unload and load her
i again. Captain Berude reports light
winds throughout. On July 4 dis vessel
sailed over what appeared to be the keel
of a vessel. It was about 100 feet long and
was bolted with four and six inch spikes.
This was in latitude 22.20 north, longitude
153 west. This is probably the keel that
was reported by one of the coasters a
couple of weeks ago.

Alaska excursion steamer Mexico for a

The barkentine Planter, which ran be
tween here and Honolulu until the South
ern Pacific's discrimination drove :he
trade to Portland, has been taken from her
retirement, and will load lumber at Eureka
for Sydney, N. 8. W.
The schooner Oceania Vance, now at
Honolulu, has a new .master. Captain
Dart, late of the schooner Sparrow, went
down to the islands to assume command,
but had to carry the matter to the con
sular courts before he could oust Captain
Anderson. The latter came back to San
Francisco on the steamer Australia, but
he has not so far gone near the owners.
The agent of the vessel says that since the
vessel sailed for Australia" they have never
heard from the master, and learned by the
last steamer, from outside sources, that he
had taken three women with him, as
passengers, from Bydney to Honolulu.
The managing owner would like to see
Anderson. â¢
Plumbers Protest.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald has gent a
letter to the Board of Health requesting that
the board make a few changes in the rules and
regulations, adopted April 15, 1896, referring
to the examination of persons desiring to be
come registered as master or journeymen
plumbers. One section provides that such ex
aminations shall be held on the first and third
Friday of each month at 3p. m. The objection
to this is that the hour will necessitate the ap
plicant losing half a day's work. The second
objection in the assessment of 50 cents npon
each person taking an examination. The Com
missioner's request was made at the instance
of the Plumbers' Union, who wish to have the
hour changed from 3:30 p. m. to 8 p. m. and
who do not think that any charge should be
inaae.
QUADE & CO, MAY SETTLE
The Firm Will Probably Pay
Sever ty-five Cents on
the Dollar.
If Some Agreement Is Not Reached
at Tc-Day's Conference Insolv
ency May Result.
There is a very fair probability that the
assignment made by A. Quade & Co., the
wholesale grocers, at 6.36 Market street,
for the benefit oi their creditors, will be
seltled soon in a way satisfactory both to
the firm and its creditors.
A committee of the Board of Trade re
ported that the liabilities amount to
| $20,000. Ti i assets, they found, would
I fully cover this amount. Quade & Co.
made a proposition to settle for 50 cents
on the dollar, but the creditors thought
that they mieht get more.
It was finally agreed that a proposition
should be made to Quade & Co. to settle
for 75 cents on the dollar. Tne result can
j not be known until after a conference to
be held to-day at 4 p. m.
If Quade & Co. agree to the proposition
of the creditors it is believed that the
affair will be settled to the satisfaction of
all in the near future, otherwise the firm
| will be obliged either to go into insolvency
I or hand the business over to the creditors
and permit the matter to wind up in
liquidation.

TEACHER OF LAW AT YALE
United States District Judge
Townsend Arrives From
the East.
Students Should Spend Two Years in
Class Work and One Tear
in Law Office.
Professor William H. Townsend of the
law department in Yale University, where
he has been teaching for the last fifteen
years, arrived at the Palace Hotel yester
day from the Yosemlte and the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado, two scenic won
ders that were largely responsible for
this, his first visit to the Far West.
Like almost every other member of the
faculty of New Haven, Professor Townsend
is teaching where he himself was taught
years before He was graduated from
Yale University with the class of '71, of
which, he says, Gordon Blanding, ths
attorney of this City, was also a member.
Pour years ago Professor Townsend was
appointed United States District Judge of
Connecticut, a position he still holds. For
fifteen years previous to bis judicial ap
pointment he was a practicing attorney
in New Haven and was for some time cor
poration council of that city. Corporation
law is his specialty.
Comparing Yale of '71 with Yale of '96
Professor Townsend says that in his day a
graduating class of 100 was considered
large, while now 800 men are graduated in
one year from the combined academic and
scientific departments of Yale, which
has a total enrollment of nearly 2500 stu
aents.

HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW FATHER?
So Said Senator J. G. Fair
to Fair Margaret
Craven.
SHE BID NOT LIKE HIM
The Young Actress Tells What
She Knows About the Mar
riage Contract
SHE REBUKED HER MOTHER.
Thought There Should Be No Secrecy
in Such a Matter, but She
Kept the Secret. â¢ â¢
Miss Margaret Cravenâ that bit of re
freshine color in the rust and dust of the
Fair will case â demure," sincere, candid,
the center of a circle. of lawyers, with a
background of leather-bound books, her
firm old friend Mrs. Haskins sitting by in
her widow's weeds, answered and an
swered questions yesterday. She is an
actress, and she had for the day not the
center of the stage alone, for she was the
whole entertainment. . All the rest was
mere "property."
She is an actress, and a fairly good one,
too, but she did not act. She wore the ap
pearance of the reluctant witness, a young
woman who felt the position to be embar
rassing, but who recognized that direct
answers led the way most quickly and
satisfactorily to a conclusion of this
sc ene.
She was dressed neatly and -quietly in
gray with white silk trimmings and white
kid gloves.
The scene op ened in Mitchell A Pier
son's office was tran sferred to the assem
bly-room of the Mills building, and
because of a lack of fresh air was trans
ferred in the afternoon to Garret McEn
erney's office in Nevada block.
Miss Craven was first questioned about
herself â the questions being put with
courteous consideration by McSnerney.
The young lady first went on the stage
in 1891 and had 'since been much over the
road and in New York. She had been in
this City several times since. She came
first as a member of the Empire Theater
stock company. She did not remember
when she first met James G. Fair, it was
so long ago.
"When did yon last see him*'.'
"When we were living at 2007 California
street." .
"Did you know that your mother was
married to him?"
"Yes. Mother told me about tin con
tract in the summer of 1892."
"You visited the City again with a the
atrical company ?"
"Yes, with the 'Comedians.' in Decem
ber, 1892."
"Did you see Senator Fair at that time ?' '
"Yes. He asked me at that time how I
liked my new father.."
"And- what did you say?"
"I said 1 did not like the secrecy sur
rounding the marriage. He answered that
that would be made all right at the proper
time."
"How did your mother come to tell you
about the marriage?"
â¢ "We were talking about some-confiden
tial matters, when she remarked : 'What
would you fay if I was married to the
Senator?' I said I did not know. If it
was true I said 1 thought it ought not to
be kept secret. She then said she had a
contract of marriage with him. I asked
if that formed a legal marriage, and she
said it did. I told her I was not pleased,
for I did not like the Senator personally
very well. Yes, we talked about the mat
ter frequently every time I saw her."
"Did your mother tell any one else
about her marriage ?' : !
"She tola Miss Johnson of the Colonial
Hotel V
"Is the marriage contract in ink or pen
cil?"
"In ink"â very decisively.
Tne witness tnen told about the package
âcontaining the willsâ coming to her at
the Empire Theater from her mother.
She had been advised that it was valuable
and that she must take great care of it, but
not of its nature. She took it home, j
wrapped it in some clothes and placed it j
at the bottom of her strongest trunk. She i
had "studio apartments"â bedroom, sit- I
ting-room and bath â at 116 Forty-first
street. New York.
By degrees the questioner reached the
point where Mrs. Craven came on to New
York to recover the package. She was
very ill. She opened the packet in her
daughter's presence and for the first time
the latter knew of its important character.
"I upraided her for being so careless in
sending such valuable papers to me in
Buch a way and not telling me what I bad
to expect. She said she wanted to get it
out of the State; that she knew no better
way to Keep it from being traced, and that
ene wanted time to think about it; wanted
to avoid the notoriety if she could. I did
not speak at that time of her not being
mentioned in the will, but I did after
ward."
About the deeds the witness said:
"Senator Fair urged mother, who was
ill, to give up her school. He wanted me
to help him to influence her. He said she
was always talking about being indepen
dent. He said he would give her some
deeds to income-bearing property that
would make her independent."
"Did Senator Fair not maintain your
mother after their marriage?"
"I do not know."
"Did he maintain you?"
"No, sir."
'.'Did you never speak to yoar mother as
to whether or not Senator Fair provided
her with money?"
"We never spoke about it directly."
"What did she say indirectly f '
"Well, I know that she never wanted for
money."
"Do you mean to give us to understand
that your own earnings were sufficient, or
that Senator Fair supplemented them?"
"I know that our own earnings were not
sufficient. I know that Senator Fair also
wanted me to leave the stage."
"What did he say he would do for you?"
"He said he would take care of me."
"How often did he urge you in this
manner?"
"He said so several times after the mar
riage; nearly every time I came here."
"Did you ever discuss with Mr. Lloyd or
Mr. Wheeler the matter of your mother's
marriage?"
"Something was said in Mr. Wheeler's
office, by Mr. Wheeler, I think, about the
contract as an existing thing. About the
$500,000, that was mentioned several times.
My mother, I remember, said to them, in
a half-joking way, that they had better
live up to it or they knew what would
happen. Mr. Wilson on one occasion
spoke about a republication of the will of
the 21st. Mother said if they had a re
publication it would have to be after De
cember 10."
"What did she mean by that?"
"1 don't know. She simply said that.
Mr. Wilson said to her: 'If you have any
papers to file it is my advice that you file
them.' Mother said something about pre
ferring to follow her own advice."
Witness said she had seen Senator Fair
MARGARET CRAVEN TELLING WHAT SHE KNEW ABOUT THE CASE.
draw several willsâ the first in 1891 in her
mother's apartments at 2002 Pine street.
"Senator .fair wiote the will in my
presence. It was written in ink. I was in
and out of the room. I was packing to go
away then. When he finished he asked
me to be a witness to it. I said I didn't
like to put my name to a paper, not know
ing what it was. He said it would not hurt
me. I said, ' Very well; in a lew minutes.' I
left the room and when I returned he had
evidently changed his mind about having
it witnessed. There was no one else pres
ent but mother and the Senator. When
the Senator had gone and I saw mother
alone I asked her what it was the Senator
wanted me to sign and she told me it was
a will."
"Did she tell yoc about the will of the
24th of September, 1894?"
"Oh yes, I knew about that,"
"Did you ever correspond with Senator
Fair?"
"No. sir."
"Did you ever receive a letter from
him?"
"Yes, I have received notes of no im
portance â telling me to say to mother
that he was coming up or something of
that nature."
"Can you tell us the contents of the let
ter from your mother immediately pre
ceding the receipt of by you of the pack
age containing the will? 1 '
"Yes, sir; she said she was going to
send me some papers that were very
valuable, and that I must not open the
package and must take great care of it.
She spoke of the Senator's death and
said she could scarcely realize it as yet."
"Did your mother "tell you about the
circumstance when she arrived in New
York on the occasion of her loss of the
will at Denver?"
"Yes, sir. She told me about having
lost it from under her pillow. She also
told me how she believed that she had
been followed from San Francisco."
In the cross-examination by Mr. Del
mas, the witness said she couid not re
me-niber when she first met Senator Fair,
because her acquaintance with him ran
back to her earliest recollection.
"You did not relish the idea of the mar
riage?"
"No, sir; I did not."
"You did not personally like the Sena
tor very well?"
"No. sir."
"Your mother showed you the marriage
contract ana you read it?"
"Yes, sir."
"You asked about the public Sty âif it
was not known?"
"Yes; mother said the Senator wanted
to settle up his affairs so that he might go
away with Her. Then it was to be made
public, she said."
"You asked her what might happen if
the Senator should die in the meantime ?"
"It was not at that time, but I did ask
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1896.
that later. She answed that the Senator
would have provided for her. and she
hoped in that case that the fact of the
marriage would die with him."
"When your mother showed you the
willsâ the pencil and the ink copyâ did
you notice any difference between them?"
"I said that the ink will was not written
so well as the other. Mother answered :
'No, he found it difficult to write in ink' "
"Your mother was very loth to give pub
licity to the marriage contract after the
Senator's death?"
"Yes, sir."
"And you urged your mother to keep
back the facts of the contract and the
deeds if possible?"
"Yes, sir, I did after the Senator's
death."
"You thought that that end would be
secured by the contract by which your
mother was to receive $500,000 for the re
linquishment of all her claims?"
"Yes, sir."
"And your mother only put the deeds
on record when she saw that her expecta
tions in that regard were a delusionâ that
the provisions of the contract were not to
be fulfilled?"
"Yes, sir."
"When Mr. Wilson was about to go to
Alaska there was some question as to who
would look after your interests?"
"Yes, sir, and I remember that Wheeler
threw bis arms around Mr. Wilson's neck
and said: 'I will stand at thy right hand
and keep the bridge with tbee.' "
Miss Craven laughed heartily at this and
the lawyers joined her.
"Did Mr. W heeler say anything about
his reputation being at stake in the matter
of the pencil will?"
"Yes, sir. He said that he had under
taken to see that it was probated ; that he
was a young man yet and that he could
not afford to renounce it. He referred to
the cry of its being a forgery, and laughed
at it, saying that it was ridiculous that
such a claim should be made by men who
bad not yet seen it. He thought it a good
joke."
"Bat what did he do afterward about
the bridge?"
"Oh," said the young lady, with an im
patient BUrug, "he left it He went to
New York."
"Went to guard the New York end of
it. eh?"
"Possibly."
"Did you bare any talk with Mr. Lloyd
as to the genuineness of the pencil will?"
"Oh, yes. He said that will would be
probated ; that they were taking their own
way about it, but tnat it would be pro
bated."
This also caused much merriment on the
part of the lawyers on both sides.
"You have testified as to a conversation
with Colonel Trumbo in New York. Is
that Colonel Isaac Trumbo?"
"Nothing was said as to a conversation â
only that she had been introduced by
Colonel Trumbo," said MitohelL
"That entails a conversation I should
judge. ColouÂ«l Trumbo would not intro
duce a lady by signs."
Mitchell subsided and McEnerney was
much amused. The witness being interro
gated again said it was Colonel Isaac
Trurabo,
McEnerney resumed the questioning,
Delmas having finished.
"You have testified that you were pres
ent when Senator Fair frequently called
upon your mother."
"Yes, sir."
"What time of day was he in the habit
of calling?"
"Sometimes in the afternoon and some
times in the evening."
"Did he ever s'ayat nightf"
"I don't know."
Mitchell asked a few more questions.
"Your mother is still ill?"
"Yes sir."
"Confined to bed?"
"Yes, sir."
"What are the symptoms of your moth
er's illness?" asked Delmas.
"Well, it seems to be a general breaking
down. She has been ill for a long time.
The deposition was finished. It will be
reaa to the young lady this afternoon and
if all is correct she will sign it.

The Grand Lodge of the Pacific Coast
District, Order of the Sons of St. George,

that the City wanted to buy them out, and
yesterday in a communication to the
board offered through Abe Cohen and
Mrs. Carrie Simon to sell out for $20,000 â
little more than half of the original de
mand.
They admit that the reason of their sud
den determination to sell out is that the
removal of the party wall, necessary for
the construction of the new building,
would bring the ramshackle brick struc
tures down about their ears.
Some of the tops with which Chinamen
amass themselves are as big as barrels and
it takes three men to spin one.

Â« Â° & r â¢
The condition of the sheep business and '
of the various woo 4 industries of this State :
and of the Union make a fine object les- '
Fon for tÂ£e advocates of a protective tariff,
for it is an easy matter to show that the
same blow that "killed the McKinley law
laid low most of the industries dependent
on shesp-raising for their prosperity.
It is currently stated in the local San
Francisco marktt that the sheep-raisers of j
this State are liardly making expenses; '
that the only way they survive is by sell
ing many sheep for mutton, and that they
would go out of business but for their hope
of a revival of some such protective tariff 'â â 
as that under which they recently pros
pered.
From all quarters the news comes that
sheep-raisers are not breeding their herds
and that their only salvation is to turn
tbeir s.hjeep into mutton rather than shear
them totwool. The effect of such a.condi
â¢tion is" strikingly apparent In the San
Francfsco market, where nearly all the
warehouses, commission firms and scour
injs-mills feel the depression to the point
of discouragement. A visit to the wool
exchange at Fifth and Townsend streets
and a study of tha inactivity there reveals
the fact-that there is no market. It is for
ttols reason that all the great woolbouses
are practically closed.
Many of the heavy dealers say they
would go out of the business permanently
but for their Belief that the free- trade pol
icy of the Wilson bill will sooner or later
be abandoned, even by the Democrats, as
a worthless system for this country.
Under the McKinley bill, which became
nullified two years ago, Humbolflt wool
brought 20 and 25 centa a pound in the
grease, but under the Wilson bill in effect
to-day the warehouses are full of this
wool, and it does not move at 12 or even
11 cents.
Speaking of the deplorable condition of
the market yesterday, Shoobert A Beale's
manager, fcaid': -'The wool clip here this
year is fully 17.TXX) bates short of normal.
That means 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 pounds,
and it requires no imagination to see that
â¢such a lo^s must be a serious detriment to
the Staje." ..
It has been amply demonstrated during
the two years since the Democrats de
stroyed the dnty on raw wool that Ameri
can growers cannot survive in competition*
with Australia and other great wboi
prowinp countries, where land is almost
free and where labor is very cheap.
Dealers of all shades of political belief
freely admit that Australia can produce
better wool than has ever been grown in
' California, and that the cost of producing
it is about one-filth that which prevails in
this State. Under such a state of affairs
the records of every custom-house show a
ereat importation of foreign wool. This,
has everywhere resulted in ruin to the
home producer. . â¢ *
According to a report recently prepared
oy Worthington Ford, chief of the statis
tical bnfreau of the Treasury Department,
the decline in tbe sheep in iustry has been
marked fqj ten years, jhougtj it revived
â¢wonderfully under the brief protection of
the short-lived McKinley bill.
From Mr. Ford's table it appears that
the number of sheeD in America has de
clined from 48,322,331 in 1885 to 39,372,943
in. 1895, and the scoured wool produced
has declined from 124,945,825 pounds in
1885 to : 101,718,690 pounds in 1895. these
figures showing a decrease of 8,372,943 in
the number of animals, and 23,226,935
pounds of scoured wool.
Of this enormous reduction no less than
3,552,606 head of sheep and 10,373,587
pounds of scoured wool occurred between
1894 ans 1895; but, apart from this, the de
cline was uniform during the whole period.
It is alsp notewoTfetoy that the decline in the
wool-prtoducing districts hasiteen greater
than these figures show, as in a few of the
Western States, where sheep are now kept
primarily for their mutton.
Every, trade circular issued by wool com
mission'merchants for a year has noted a
marked and steady decline of the market,
and every shrewd agent has advised his
correspondents that the outlook must be
steadily; worse under free trade.
The situation to-day is in striking con
trast to the condition of the market even a
year ago, and it is steadily growing worse.
A year ago the Boston market handled
10,000,000 pounds of wool for the week
ending Juiy 6, but this year less than
1,000,000 pounds were handled in the same
market. The total sales from January 1
to June 1 of this year footed 63,030,000
pounds against 98,904,500 pounds during
the same period 'last year, a decline of
35,874,000 pounds, an amount sufficient to
make a general depression throughout the
entire country. â¢
It must be understood, however, that
tne Toliime of business transacted this
year, in addition to being much smaller
than that of last year, has been at far
lower prices than those that prevailed in
an active market under the McKinley bill.
The following quotations from Fenno
Brothers and Childs' Weekly Wool Re
port, under the dates named, is a graphic
picture of the wool market under Cleve-
Jar.dism as expressed by the Wilson bill,
tbe idol of free traders:
June 6â Boston market continues in 'its rut
of dullness and, under the influence of an al
most stagnant demand, the volume of trade
has shrunk to small proportions. The enor
mous imports of woolen goods which still con
tinue to hang as a menace over our home
manufacturers ace in a large measure account
able for this great curtailment In the consump
tion of wool, the consuming power of our i
country in its present condition not being |
large enough to take care of the supply of
domestic and foreign wools now being pressed
tor sale by mill agents, Jobbers and importers.
Continuing, the circular gives the follow
ing discouraeine picture, one of the results
of tbe Wilson bill:
Manufacturers still continue to pursue a
most conservative course in their wool opera
tions and it is only where they are tempted
by extremely low figures that they are in
clined to buy at all. A general feeling of
doubt and uncertainty seems to be spreading
in all directions.
The. report for the week following shows
another picture oi the havoc wrought by
the Democratic policy of free trade and
ruin. It is as follows:
June 13â The volume of trade daring the
past week â¢ again shows a falling off and em
rOiatically attests to the apathy shown by
manufacturers bo far as increasing their sup
ply of wool is concerned. In spite oi the fact
that many holders, in their desire to unload
their stock of old wool, have offered great in
ducements in order to make sales, manufac
turers are little inclined to anticipate their
wants, evidently waiting until an increased
demand for their goods develops itself.
In view of the lesson taught by two
years of free trade the wool growers and
dealers feel that they may well say to the
Democrats, in the language of their own
leader whom Charles A. Dana christened
"The stuffed prophet," "It is a condi
tion, and not a theory, that conft
fronts us." And the condition for which
two years of free trade are
responsible is deplorable in the sight of
men who love their country and rejoice
at the prosperity of its great enterprises.
Under free trade sheep men are discour
aged, wool dealers are going out of busi
ness and factories are idle. Where once
the spindles a.id looms were busy, all is
silence and decay. Industry is paralyzed
and hungry men in the manufacturing
regions walk the streets in search of food.
Such is the verdict of facts. "Sot until
we have protection, again," said a promi
nent wool-dealer yesterday, "can we ex
pect-prosperity again." .

HEW TO-DAY.
AMEMIMENt
AND SUCCESSFUL
SPECIALIST!
Gives His Views of the Care
and Treatment of the
Sick.
There are very few men who have not
suffered some time or other with some
form of disease. Many have been per-
manently cored and others have received
bat a temporary stay of their disease, and
at regular intervals they are annoyed with
the distressing symptoms, if not the
disease itself, with all its setbacks, pain,
anguish and mental distresses.
Very few diseases attack a man alone,
they are invariably complicated or, inter-
mingled with others, and on this account
are very difficult for many practitioners to
cure. â â "â ;*
Take a physician worthy of the care of
your life, be must not merely be a man
holding a diploma from some medical col-
lege; it does not assist the sick man if his
physician should thoroughly understand
all the ancient and modern languages.
No; he must be a man who is endowed by
nature with powers far greater than is
possible to obtain through a course in
Chemistry or Medicine at some college; he
must possess an innate genius to imme-
diately grasp the exact condition of your
system; he must also possess a thorough
knowledge of Medicine; he must be a
man who has had an unlimited and varied
experience in the treatment of all diseases
covering periods of years.

therms, or dotted linen, equals temperature. The \
word "hieh" means lileh barometric pressure and I
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low" '
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded 1
and accompanied by cloudy weather and ' rains. 1
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington |
coast. Wh(*n the pressure is high in the Interior
and Jow along the coast, and the Isobars extend I
Corth and south alone the coast, rain Is probable; j
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of j
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in die vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer *"<! colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition* â 
will produce an opposite result. e>

Financial.
'* NEW 0 YORK, N.Y., July 29âStocTcs at the'
' opening generally lower, the declines In the
usually active list extending to %01% per cent.
London cables were disappointing and local bears
were aggressive at this time, the failure of the New
York City and Brooklyn City gold loans and the
political uncertainty being used against the mar
ket. About 11 o'clock a steadier tone prevailed
and a, sight rally ensued. But subsequently the
entire list weakened on renewed sales for both the.
short and long account. Sugar was hammered
down to 100, a loss of 1% per cent, as compared
with yesterday's final transactions, while the j
Grangers, Manhattan. Western Union, Louisville
and Nashville and Chicago Gas fell anywhere from '
> %*to 1% per cent.
â¢ In the mac tive Issues Lackawanna dropped from '
152 to 1480147, . Lake Shore from 145 to 140@141 i
and Bullman Palace from 147 to 143, all on light
' transactions. During the afternoon session the
room* traders and small bears generally started in
to cover and the market in consequence presented
a firmer front. For some reason, not clearly ex
plained, the trading element was disposed to take
a more cheerful view of the* chances of the sound
money advocates in the coming Presidential elec
tion, and the afternoon advance was attributed to
this belief. In the advance sugar was most promi
nent, rising from 100 to 10-%. . *
The grangers, Chicago Gas, Lake Shore, â¢South
western and Manhattan moved up 14 to 1% per
cent. Near the close sugar suddenly ran off to
101%, checking the rising tendency in the gen
eral market. In the final dealings the market
was barely steady. Net changes in the active
stocks show gains Of Vi@lV& per cent. Sugar lost
Vs and some of the specialties 2S/g@s Per cent.
Total sales were 238. 889 shares, including 63,800
sugar: 43,700 St. Paul: 18.800 tobacco and
14,600 Burlington. .*

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Jnly ; 29.â portion of yester
day's depreciation in wheat was recovered imme
diately upon the opening of the market this morn
ing, a local operator of prominence was a buyer
against sales made yesterday, and the demand for
his account was of sufficient importance to cause
the rally. The Liverpool market, was equ '.ly as
Indifferent to the break of yesterday on this side
as It was to the recent advance. * Bulls found some
consolation in that fact and scattered buying was
influenced thereby. Receipts at Chicago were
105 cars, and 93,725 bushels were w. indrawn
from store. The Northwest had 366 cars, against
490 last Wednesday and 197 a yea? ago. Brad
street's favor cave a decrease in the world's
available supply of 746,000 bushels, which was a
disappointment to holders and resulted In an
easier market subsequently. Closing continental
quotations were all lower. Export clearances were
liberal at 441.029 bushels. During the last hour
the tone hardened, and sellers of calls in endeav
oring to protect themselves rushed values higher.
September wheat opened from 67*4Â« to 58c ad
vanced to 58% c, closing at 59@59Vgc, lÂ»/s c higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row 75 cars. "
â  CORNâ Deprived a species of â  benefit , from the
Improved tone and price of wheat, but it was self
evident that lherÂ» was no confidence existing.
Trade was very dull and the news was of no par
ticular interest. Liverpool cables were steady.
Receipts were 736 cars, and 289.579 bushels
were withdrawn from store. Export clear
ances amounted to 212,307 bushels. Brad
street's gave an increase in available stocks of
811.000 bushels. September corn opened at
24% c; sold between 24Vgc and 34 % c. closing at
I 24!>4c to 24% c, 3/ B cto %c higher than yesterday.
mated receipts for to-morrow, 860 cars.
OATSâ Were quiet with a firm undertone pres
ent. The action of the other grains was not en
tirely disregarded, but there was much independ
ence in the sentiment. Receipts were 77 cars, and
133,611 bushels were taken from store. Brad-
I street's gave a decrease in available stocks of 820,-
I 000 bushels- September oats closed %c higher
j than yesterday. Estimated receipts -for to-mor
row. 120 cars. Â»*Â»-.fcwVr*Vii
FLAXâ Was firm; cash, 72072% c; September.

PROVISIONSâ only sustaining agent in
provisions was the covering by snorts. There was
no comfort to holders to be derived from the hog
I market, where a decline of s@lochad taken place,
{ and the consumptive Inquiry was not great
: enough to stimulate buying of the futures. Sep

COFFEE â C E. Blckford's circular says:
"Markets everywhere have steadily declined dur
ing the past ten days, and dealers use the utmost
caution in their buying: in fact fighting shy to such
an extent that sales have been o( the most narrow
proportions, and these effected with great diffi
culty. Sentiment against the article is predicated
upon the prospect of an Increased output, espe
cially in this season's crop from Brazil, a belief that
U fostered by the weak attitude of the Brazilians,
and in Its effect largely augmented â¢by â  the poor
condition of trad* In consuming countries. With
us values have been lost to a certain extent for the
time being. Inferior sorts are suffering most, and
the drop In these has been severe, fully %@2c ft
ft, owing to the cheapness of relative grades of Rio
and Santos In New York. Other kinds have also
declined, but not to the same extent, the shrink
age being from %@lc, according to the style of
coffee or tbe pressure brought to bear by sellers.
Flue coffees are out of market entirely, and really
good washed sorts bold their own through scarcity
but do not move. To-day's stock consists of 2188
Costa Rica, 122 Nicaragua,' 13,801 Salvador, 14,
-075 Guatemala, 132 Mexican; in all 30 318 bags
against 796 same time last year. The steamer
San Bias is due about the 80th with 350 bags."

Oakland Office Bax Frawcisco Call,)
903 Broadway, July 29. f
The tabernacle and the annex and the
thousands of feet under canvas, where the
exposition is to open next Monday are
busy places. No matter where a visitor
stood to-day he was in the way. Every
space awarded to exhibitors was a scene of
activity. Engines are being set up, booths
erected, reception places built, decorations
were being hung and Superintendent
Sharpe and bis corps of assistants were
dancing around as though they were on
springs.
Last year there was much dissatisfac
tion and discomfort on account of there
being no auditorium from which the visi
tors could listen to the concerts and witness
tbe stage performances. There will be no
causa for complaint on that acore this year.
Tbe immense space added to the tioorage
has permitted of the arrangement of seats
facing the stage and this will be a great
advantage.
The stage has been greatly enlarged at
the east end. It runs the entire iengthof
tbe building and is tweive feet wide.
Thursday, August 6, will be the Asso
ciated Charities Woodyard Fund Day. AH
persons who patronize tbe Exposition on
this day will not only see the exhibits, but
will be putting money where it will be a
means of helpine the needy poor during
tiie coming winter months. Dr. E. S.
Chapman is chairman of tbe programme
committee, and this in itself is a guaran
tee that tne day's entertainment will be of
an excellent character. Tickets bought of

President Eels?y of the Cre-cents
Resignsâ lnteresting News
Notes. â¢
BERKELEY. Cal., July *29.â The stu
dents who have been attending the sum
mer schools ol chemistry and physics
at the State University have passed a sei
of resolutions petitioning the Board of
Regents to broaden the scope of the work,
so as to include more courses, and also to
allow students taking these courses credit
hours toward graduation. About seventy
five etudents, in all, chiefly experienced
teachers in the various high schools of the
State, have been taking the two courses
offered, fifty-four of which number have
been in the department of chemistry.
In the resolutions which they have pre
pared they offer thanks to the faculty and
regents of the University, and express a
desire that "they will still further encour
age the summer school work and increase
its benefits to the teachers of the State by
providing thÂ« funds necessary for the
maintenance of courses in all subjects im
mediately connected with hi;:h-?chool
work, in addition to the course in physics
and chemistry now given." Finally, the
petitioners especially call attention to the
almost universal demand among the teach
ers of the State for summer school courses
in pedagogy and psychology.
The petitioners state that the summer
schools, even in their incomplete state,
have been of untold advantage to them, in
that tbey have been enabled to pursue ad
vanced study in their specialties, which
will be of much service to them upon tneir
return to their respective schools.
"At Stanford," said Vice- Principal Tay
lor of tLe Grass Valley High Scnool to
day, "students taking summer courses
can get as many as eight hours' credit
toward graduation, while at Berkeley they
cannot' get any credit at all for" such
work.
"There are twenty-eight other univer
sities in America where credit hours are
given for summer school work, and we
firmly believe that the University of Cali
fornia should fail in line and do likewise."

the following resolutions were passed, en
grossed and handsomely framed and pre
sented to the faithful office-holder:
\Vhzrea*. Our brother, J. R. Capell, ow'.nz
to advancing years and increasing cares, feels
tne duties ot treasurer too severe a task on his
time and strength, and whereas, our brother
desires to resign his office that ne may be free
from the obligation* and exertions attending
the performance of duties as treasurer in order
to'employ his time in needed rest and freedom;
therefore be it
Resolved, That we deeply regret the seeming
necessity which impels our brother to vacate
the office which he nu so long and efficiently
filled, and be it
JUtolved, That we. his brothers, do gratefully
acknowledge the fidelity, loyalty and fair 1 - fu'i
incy which has characterized the w. :
Brother Capeil through the eleven years as
treasurer of University Lodge No. 144, L O. O.
F. ; and be it
Retolttd, That in our deep appreciation of
our brother's long and loving service many
voices now silent would gladly join ns in ex
tending to him tender sympathy and affec
tionate wishes for many serene and hapDy
years; that the "purple glow" after a long and
busy day may fill with gentle restiuluess the
â¢â¢October" of his life.
Rftolvci. That the heartfelt gratitude of
multitudes whorri he has comforted in sorrow,
visited In affliction and adversity, aided and
assisted to firm footing when life teemed Jbtlc
and hard, should comfort him in knowing
that each gentle deed of mercy blessed man
kind.
JUtoix.ed, Tnat our order crowns him with
Jewels that can never lose their luster, lor love
is eternal, immortal, and its Cowers fade not
away when they bloom in Justice, Mercy,

VACANCY IN COUNCIL.
Mayor Davie Will Dispense With
His Telephone lor Ten
Days.
MUCH HASGS ON THE CHOICE
The Appointment Will Have a Direct
Bearing on Next Year's
Tax Levy.
Oakland Office Sas Fbascisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 29. J
There is a vacancy in the City Council.
A vacancy anywhere in official life in this
city is enough to create a political cyclone,
but at this particular time, when the veto
power of the Mayor depends on one vote,
the matter is of supreme importance.
There is only $40 a month in it, as the
saying goes, but how much can be got
"out of it" is something tbat the public
has been trying to solve, 10, theae many
years.
Mr. Capell, whose death caused the va
cancy, was not one of Mayor Davie's
ardent supporters. He would vote to up
hold the Mayor when he thought he was
right, but as he almost invariably thought
his Honor was wrong Mr. Capell did not
often vote with Mr. Bassect. One vote
more on his side at this time, with a cer
tain fight for a dollar tax levy ahead,
means a great deal to the Mayor, and it is
a foregone conclusion that the man who
fills the vacancy will certainly be a sup
porter of the administration.
The Mayor said to-day that he would
make no appointment for ten days. But
that does not mean that the horde of
hungry politicians will wait that length of
time before they besiege him with applica
tions and petitions. A little anecdote was
told to-day tnat throws a true lizbt on the
indecent baste which politicians show to
fill dead men's snoes.
A man who is supposed to have some in
fluence witn the Mayor was asked by a
would-be candidate to assist his efforts.
"What do you want?" asked the man
supposed to have a "pull."
"To be a Councilman," said the candi
date.
'â¢From what ward?"
"The Seventh."
"What's the matter with Capell?"
"Oh, ne died an hour ago! And the
man with influence was bo disgusted that
ne walked off.
Among those who are anxious for the
honor are A. W. Bishop, Rudolf Crist, W.
H. Watson, W. O. Lindsey, Kowell Capell,
George Kaufman and E. C. Sessions. As
the deceased member was a member at
large, the Mayor need not necessarily ap
point a successor, from the Seventh Ward,
but can pick from any part of the city. It
is reasonably, certain â¢ that none of those
mentioned by their friends will be invited
to the vacant â  chair. Each of the names
so far advanced represents some of the
influences that have not :so far extended
much hearty support to the administra
tion, and, consequently, they cannot de
mand much. - .
It is more than likely that the Mayor
will decide upon a member of the Mer
chants' Exchange, of which body he is a
member. . There is a thorough revision of
the ordinance , regulating licenses and
peddlers in contemplation, and a member
of the exchange will be of great service at
this time. .
The Mayor said to-night that he thinks
he will have his residence ; telephone dis
connected till he has made the appoint
ment. WfjMfeVtBWBBBBBfiI

WAS THE MILK POISONED?

the House Cat.
School Principa s to Be Instructed
in Their Attitude to Pupils,
Teachers and Officials.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 29.â A. E. Mc-
Enerney to the police this
morning that some malicious persons had
tried to poison him.
His story is that the pofson was placed
in his milk. He left the can out on the
gate-post and about 8 o'clock this morn
ing he brought it into tbe house. 'My
wife made tea for our breakfast and we
used some of the milk in it. We had
hardly more than drank it uown when
first my wife and then I was taken vio
lently sick and began to vomit. I knew
something was wrong and we each took
an emetic to get the poison out of our
stomachs. "We could not imagine what
had caused it My wife suggested that
perhaps something had been placed in the
milk, so I gave some to our cat and in a
few minutes she died. I know there was
poison in the can, but I don't know what
kind it was nor who could have put it
there."
The police have decided to wait for fur
ther developments and the cat is put in
evidence.
School Opening;*
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 29.â The public
schools will reopen on Monday, and on
the Saturday before opening the principals
of the schools will meet in the City Hall,
when they will be addressed by Scnool
Superintendent Sullivan in regard" to their
duties. It is expected that he will draw
trie attention of the principals particularly
to the new rule adopted by the board re
quiring principals to devote two hours
daily to teaching where more than eight
classes are under his charge. Most of the
principals have been following thit course
for some time past. The organization of
their classes, the general supervision of
the buildings and yards, and tbe attitude
of principals toward teachers, pupils,
school patrons and officials will also be

S. D. WORDEN MUST HANG
The Supreme Court Denies His
Request for a New
Trial.
His Crime Is Called "Murder of the
Most Aggravated and Shocking
Character."
8. D. \vorden, who was recently con
victed of the murder of Samuel C. Clark
and sentenced to death for the crime, has
gained nothing by his appeal to the
Supreme Court. In a decision filed yes
terday Justice McFarland, with the con
currence of his colleagues on the bench,
affirmed the judgment and order of the
lower court denying the motion for a new
trial.
The circumstances adduced by the evi
dence pointed to murder of a peculiar
character, the deceased Clark being engi
neer of a train which ran off a high trestle
near Sacramento owing to one of the rails
being moved aside by Worden and
others at tha time of the great railway
strike about two years ago. The techni
cal points upon which a retrial was de
manded were decided to be insufficient.
In passing upon the petition the court,
referring to the allegation that the trial
jury was wrongly instructed, makes use
of the following language:
The court fully informed the jury that an in
tent to take human lite is a necessary element
of murder in tbe first degree. They were toid
that in order to convict the defendant of mur
der In tbe first degree they must be convinced
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant
either personally or in concert with others
killed the deceased with malice aforethought.
Dy some kind of willful, deliberate and pre
meditated killing, and that in order to consti
tute murder in the first degree tbe intent to
kill must be the result of deliberate premedi
tation. This principle was given to the jury
In various lorms, and it was beyond question
that the evidence abundantly warranted tbe
jury in finding the d?fendant guilty of mur
der in the first degreeâ murder of a most ag
gravated and shocking character.
Worden is at present in the State Prison
at Folsom, wmther he was conveyed over
a year ago to await his execution.

Out at the Ingleside track is a force
of men at work beautifying the grounds
and making many imnrovements.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club's new house
will be com Dieted by October L ln order
to avoid the possibility of the electric-cars
frightening fractious teams the carriage
entrance has been placed at the corner
near the Ingleside House, and the drive to
tne grand stand will be on the inside of
the inclosure and away from the cars.
For some time past the management has
had a number of landscape gardeners at
work at the track, and before long some of
the prettiest landscape gardening in the
State can be seen there.
Applications for stalls have been com- I
ing in so fast that the management will
be compelled to build several new barns
for next winter. Advices from the East
give the information that all the stables
here last winter will return this year, and
in addition will come many of the large
stables that have never been here. It is
expected that this will be one of the live
liest racing seasons ever experienced on
the coast.
The Market-street Railway Company is
now putting in machinery for much more
power than it had last season. More cars
will be put on the road, and the large
crowds that are expected to attend the
races will be handled with ease and com
fort.
A historic cotton vrood tree in Greeley,
Colo., was blown dowL by a storm the other
day. Susan, the sisternf Ouray, Dead chief
of the Utes at the time of the Meeker
Qiassacre, was once tied to v to be burned,
but she was rescued by a detachment of
United States soldiers from Fort Collins.

CHINESE WILL
PRESERVE PEACE,
This Promise Was Made
Last Night to the
Police.
MEETING OF SEE TUPS.
. Sergeant Price and Attorney
Campbell Frame an Ulti
matum,
FINAL AGREEMENT REACHED.
Millionaire Merchants Smoke and
tâ ' Pledge Co-operation in Return
for Protection.
A great meeting of Chinese merchants
was held laat night in Chinatown at 735
Commercial street. The merchants pres
ent were See Yaps. They were assembled
to consider the recent Chinatown troubles
and with them met representatives of the
Police Department and also their attorney,
J. C. Campbell.
Into a room surrounded by costly furni
ture with figured silk hangings were
.crowded possibly 200 Chinese merchants,
who, according to Attorney Campbell,
'â¢ represented $17,000,000 worth of pro per ty.
: There was one Chinese merchant in the
party who is reputed to be worth $2,000,
-000. They came together about 9 o'clock.
Sergeant Price of the police force was with
them and made a apeecn. Attorney Camp
bell also addressed the assemblage.
! The proceedings were very like what
might take place at a gathering of
white men. Only just outside of the door,
at the head of a flight of stairs, was a joss
outfit. The merchants smoked Sen Yup
made cigars and listened with gravity
until it came their turn to talk. The air
. was blue with the smoke which Mongolian
puffed out with the persist
ence and volume of young locomotives.
The purpose of the meeting was to reach
an understanding concerning the preser
vation of peace in Chinatown. Chief
;Crowley was- determined that there shall
be no more shooting or other violence in
that section without makings some one re
sponsible. His plan carried very well, as
'before tne meeting was over the assem
bled merchants, who represent five, of the
' Six Companies, and, through their socie
. :ties, nineteen-twentieths of the popula
tion of Chinatown, gave predges that they
- would act as one person to put down dis
order;, to prevent meetiags which are
. ! likely to lead to disturbances, to give all
(information necessary, to acquaint the
: police with any threatened disturbance in
ttime to prevent it from comine off. and, in
. brief, to co-operate at all times with Chief
Crowley in keeping Chinatown peaceful.
; With the nineteen-twentieths of China
town thus pledged through their repre*
sentativeq, Chief Crowley was satisfled
Â that a good night's work had been done.
So was Sergeant Price, whoae speech cdi
' ned and delighted the black-capped and
â  pig-taiied merchants. 80 was Attorney
Campbell.
Â° ; Chief Crowley expected to be in at the
opening of the meeting, but was not able
to get there until late. Sergeant Price
told the merchants that the police are de
termined to have peace. The Chief is re
solved that any person guilty of violence
who is arrested shall be prosecuted to the
t full extent of the law.
j "The police," continued Sergeant Price,
''are ready and anxious to co-operate with
Â»the Chinese merchants, and look to the
merchants to furnish information prompt
ly to that end. There must be no more
â  lawless gatherings. Should there be an
attempt to hold one the attendants will be
dispersed very promptly."
' The merchants listened, and as most of
them now understand English very well
there was very little need for the services
of a Chinese interpreter, but the inter
preter of the Police Department was there
and repeated in Chinese what Sergeant
Price said.
. At this point Chief Crowley arrived an d
the merchants asked him if he indorsed
what the sergeant had said and if he ap
proved of the sergeant's drastic methods.
The Chief said that not only did he ap
prove of all that Price had done and said,
but that the police will go even to greater
extremes if necessary.
He is determined that the reckless
shooting and numerous murders must
be stopped, and if this cannot be accom
plished within the Taw he will even go out.
.side of the law to preserve the peace in
the Chinese quarter.
Attorney Campbell, who is employed by
the Bee Yups, also gave them a wholesome
talk. "There must be peace in China
town." he said, "and the See Yup mer
chants are able to preserve peace if they
exert their influence fully and give the
police information." He seconded all
that Sergeant Price said as a matter of
public policy and as good business sense
for the See Yup merchants. He promised
to give information personally to the
police concerning any one whoÂ° took part
In a disturbing meeting or in an actual
disturbance so far as he was able to learn
the facts.
Then the Chinese merchants got the
floor and agreed to meet the police fully
half way. They said they would do what
SEW TO-PAT.
SCRATCH
AND
SCREAM
My baby broke out with a rash. .- He would
â¢cratch and scream. â  It would take two to hold
him, and one to put medicine on him. â¢â¢ We had
to hold him sometimes an hour before we could
get him quieted down. All said that they never
saw such a face or body on any baby at on him.
I had to tie his hands tight In a cloth, night and
â  day. for five months. My sister had used COTI*
CUHA.and I began to use It. ' After only one
application, he lay down and tlept as he had not
for a month, poor little fellow. < He has not a scar
on him now, and is as fair and his flesh is as soft
as any baby, r While bÂ« had this disease I had to
cut th* sleeves out of his clothes, and put gauze '
underwear on him to keep him cool. I had to
keep pieei-s of soft cloth around his neck, it was
M wet with rnoivturo from the sores, and I had to I
change the cloths sometimes ten or twelve times
a day. Mm. A. lIAYKKS, Lisbon; N. D.

was required of them with directness and
at once, it any trouble should occur in
Chinatown hereafter they could not be
held blamable, for they would do every
thing possible to prevent it. At a late
hour Chief Crowley arrived and gave the
merchants a talk, and to him they also
gave assurance that they would co-operate
to prevent trouble.
Several boxes of cigars were smoked dur
ing the deliberations. There were as
many smoker- as Irving told about in his
history of New York. About midnight
the assembled merchants had all gone
home, carrying their good resolutions
with them. All they want is protection
as the price of co-operation with the po
lice.
Some of the See Yup merchants are dis
satisfied with the course of the Chinese
Consul-General, who is a Bam Yup, and
aver that he has by his actions caused
much of the recent excitement.
A FLAT DENIAL.
The Hlbernia Savings and Loan Society
Replies to Complaints.
The following communication was re
ceived yesterday :
San Francisco, July 29, 1896.
To the Public: We desire to make a short re
ply to a malicious and untruthful attack on
the management and conduct of the Hibernia
Savings and. Loan Society, filed with the Bank
Commissioners, and which has been published.
The character and history of the Hibernia
Savings and Loan Society are too well known
to the people of San Francisco to call for a de
nial of the article referred to.
The matter is now in the hands of the Bank
Commission, who promise an early report.
Were it not for the publicity already given it,
we would treat it with the silent contempt it
deserves.

MR. HAMMON'S TANDEM.
With a Kite Team He Hunts
. for a Lofty Atmos
pheric Pressure.
One of the Forecaster's Filers Gives
. an Aerial Acrobatic Per*
formance.
Forecaster Hammon hitched up his
tandem team of bie kites yesterday and
went up into the clouds for a weather
report. The bureau does not provide Mr.
Hammon with a balloon for breeae
cbasing and moisture-measuring in the
upper altitudes; consequently he must
take his lcarian nights in accordance with
the decrees of gravitation and only go
alofl officially. So the forecaster hitched
a mile and a halt of fine piano wire to his
three kites, at the corner of Scott and
Waller streets, and turned them into the
, atmosphere.
The hrst of those odd-looking aerial
contrivances'â a white muslin box with
tfce ends and a portion of the sides left
off â went up through the twenty-nve-mile
wind for about 1000 feet, when a helper
was hooked on. It sailed away, mounting
rapidly .to the same distance, while the
, first kite went perhaps 500 feet hieher. A
third' kite, larger than the other two,.
having on forty-four square -feet, was
added to the team, and soon the three
were pulling with a weight of fifty pounds
on tbe wire reel. The first kite reached
an altitude of about 2000 feet.
"After passing above the 800 or 900 feet
height the kites became steady, proving
that the strong breeze only blew at tbat
distance from the earth, and was a "sur
face wind." Noinstruments were sent up
on the kites/it being only the intension of
MR. HAMMON TESTS HIS TANDEM KITE.
[Sketched by a "Coil" artist.]
Mr. Hammon and his assistants to note
the action of the fliers and the weight of
piano wire they could pull off the earth;
also to test the endurance of a large port
able kite which Mr. Hommon has put to
gether. It floated well aloft at the end of
its mile of wire until one of its arms
slipped out of its fastening and then that
kite's actions were startling. It bucked
and plunged through the air, first over the
Mission, then across toward the Presidio.
It threw handsprings and turned somer
saults in the air in its extravagant acro
batic way. It didn't stop long enough in
one place to record any atmospheric
changes, but acted as if its only desire
was to get away from that piano wire and
lose itself over among the Alameda hills.
The weather office here is desirous of
Getting a system of forecasts on the west

registering machines to record the air
pressure, temperature and moisture, hung
high up among the clouds, the observer
may expert the winds sweeping in from
the ocean. Then the mariner may know
w K en to look for a blow from seaward.
The kites have been experimented with
for some time with gratifying success.
When this simple system of aerial ob
servation has been perfected it will be
generally used by all the weather officials.
For this object Forecaster Hammon will
hitch up his tandem-fliers and hunt for

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 30, 1596.
TAYLOR'S LIPS
ARE NOW SEALED,
His Information Will Be
Given to the Grand
Jury.
ALL IN PROPER TIME.
Denial That the Supervisors
Were Charged With
Corruption.
MASKEY IS LIKE THE SPHINX.
Bat He Says the Grand Jury Will
Continue in Session a Little
Longer.
Supervisor Taylor was a busy man yes
terday. Half a dozen men, including
members of the board and of the Grand
Jury, called on him to bear from his own
lips the discoveries he has made regarding
the bribery of Supervisors by agents of big
corporations.
Colonel Taylor does not intend to allow
the fruits of his discovery to be destroyed
by telling any facts further than those im
parted to Tax Call on Tuesday except to
the representatives of the Grand Jury. To
others he admitted that he had heard of
bribery, but refused to give any definite
information.
He is ready, however, to impart the in
formation in his possession at the proper
time to the Grand Jury or any one who is
authorized to receive it.
The statement made by Colonel Taylor
may cause the Grand Jury to prolong its
session. The finances of the city and
county have been the subject of more
discussion than have all other topics
combined, and this was, in fact,
the matter which .caused the jurors
several weeks ago to decide to keep
at -work until some time in July
at least. They determined to keep an eye
upon what might occur in the direction of
piling up expenses against tbe City and
â County in large estimates and appropria
tions.
One of the leading members of the jury
said one month ago tbat he and also other
members of tbe jury deemed it advisable
to continue their deliberations, that
what moral pressure the jurors have as a
body might be exerted. One development
has succeeded another. Now that direct
accusations affecting the acts of certain
members of the Board of Supervisors,
in connection with the reductions in
assessments of large corporations, have
been made by Supervisor Taylor, on the
authority of an informant, the proceed
ings of the Grand Jury bid fair to be con
siderably prolonged.
Foreman Maskey of the Grand Jury said
last evening that he must positively refuse
to say anything concerning what bas
taken place in the Grand Jury in reference
to Colonel Taylor's statements. In fact
he declined to say that the matter had
been considered, but at tbe same time he
would not deny it.
"I can tell you one thing," said Mr.
Maskey, "and that is all lean say. The
Grand Jury will not adjourn yet, but will
remain in session longer."
Supervisor Benjamin denied that Mr.
Taylor had mentioned the name of any
Supervisor or spoken about specific charges
of bribery at their meeting Tuesday.
"Mr. Taylor said to me he had heard ru
mors that certain members of the board
had been bribed," said Mr. Benjamin last
night, "and also that they had received
money, but he did npt specify amounts
or whom he had heard the rumors
about. He just made the remark to me
that certain members of the board had re*
ceived money.
"He did not say this to me (read
ing from the article in Thb Call
of yesterday): 'I told them that I
knew they were corrupt and tbat I
could prove it, and that if they wanted to
go with me I would take them to a man
who had paid them money, and that I
would show them to their faces tbat they
bad been bribed and how much they sold
out for.' He didn't say it to me. He
only made the remark that he had heard
rumors that certain members of the board
had been bribed. When I saw Colonel
Taylor he was alone. I don't know what
he taid to other We were

was pleasing to him."
Supervisor Hirsch was seen and the
question put to him: "Did Supervisor
Taylor make any accusation to you such
as reported in The Callâ that he could
prove tbat you had been paid money by
an agent of the board or any other person
or persons for protection in business?"
"No, sir; I know nothing of it," said
Hirsch. "I did not understand the na
ture of Wagner's resolution or I would
not have voted for it, and 1 went and toM
Colonel Taylor so. He accepted my ex
planation in pood part, shook hands with
me and we parted on a perfectly friendly
footing. There must be some mistake. I
know nothing about any money transac
tion of that kind."
NO TIME TO LOSE.
However, the Attorney-General Opines
That There \1 ill Be One Extra
Day for Registering.
In answer to an inquiry by the District
Attorney of Merced County, the Attorney-
General has given the following opinion,
of interest to ail voters as well as to the offi
cial to whom it is immediately addressed:
F. O. Ostrander, Esq., Dittrict Attorney of
Merced County. Merced, CaUâ Deab Sir: In re
ply to your inquiry as to whether or not the
time for the registration of voters, under sec
tion 1094 of the Political Code as amended In
1895 (stats. 1895, 228), shall include Monday,
the 10th day of August next, as I the last day
for registration fixed by said section falls on
Sunday, the 9th of August, I am of the opin
ion that, as the last day fixed by the statute
lalls upon Sunday, 11 legal : holiday, it should
be excluded from the computation of the time
within which the registration shall take place,
and that registration may be made during the
whole of Monday, August 10.
Section 1094 of the Political Code as amended
in 1895 (stats. 1895, 228). provides that "Reg
istration shall commence 160 days before â  a
general election, and shall , continue for |
seventy-five days next ' ensuing, when such
registration snail cease "
Section 10 of the Political Code defines holi
days, among which are included "every Sun
day.' By section 12 of the same code it is pro
vided that 'the time in which any act provided
by law Is to be done is computed by excluding
the first day and including the last, unless the
last day is a holiday, and then it Is also cx
ciuded." In other words, it is not to be com
puted as any portion of the time within which
the act is to be performed, but -is a supple
mentary day superadded by law. (Muir vs.
Galloway. 61 Cal., 506.)
<JÂ« ,i ne m Â» l^r of Estate- of Rose, :63 â  Cal.,
34b, it was held, upon the authority of section
12 of tne Code of Civil Procedure, -vhich is
identical with section 12 of the Political Code,
above quoted, that where the last day of the
time within which an appeal can be taken fell
upon a holiday, a notice of appeal given upon
the following day was. in time; and in Jeness
vs. Bowen, 77 Cat, 310, where the last day for
filing an undertaking on appeal fell upon
Sunday, it was held that an undertaking filed
upon me following day was in time. â 
There are many other cases iv the reports to
the same effect, but these are -sufficient to
show that where the last day of the time pre
scribed by laÂ» within which an act may be
done Jails upon a holiday, it, as well as the
first day, is to be excluded : from the computa
â  Respectfully,^
.W.F. FrÂ»GKBALD, Attorney-General.
The Alexandria to Beopen.
The Alexandria, 781 Butter Btreet, one of
Ban Francisco's finest private hotels, re
opens to-morrow under an entirely new

furnished throughout and, with its
sightly and convenient location, superD
cuisine, modern conveniences and mas
terly management, should prove a wel
come addition to the large number of this

ment starts out with every evidence of
permanent success.
Independent Democrats.
An independent Democratic club was organ
ized in the Thirty-second Assembly District
last night. The meeting was held at 831 Bry
ant street. James Bulllvan was selected as
chairman and George L. Manser as secretary.
In two hours 119 names were placed on the
club roll. Permanent officers will be elected
next Wednesday night.
A GARNISHMENT
ON MAHER'S FUNDS,
The Pugilist's Receipts at
the People's Palace
Attached.
JIM CARE'S OLD BILL.
Peter Was Not So Opulent on
His Last Visit to
This Coast.
Â£ QU ARE MEALS SCARCE THEN.
The Irish Champion Hay Have to
Answer an Order of Ex
amination.
The Bheriff, personated by Deputy Dick
O'Connor, took a hand in Peter Mahei's
boxing exhibition at the People's Palace
last evening by p lacing a garnishment on
tbe box receipts, or that portion of them
belonging to the heavy pugilist.
Years ago, when Maher was on this
coast, he was not so opulent as he is at
the present time and it was sometimes big
luck to have comfortable board and lodg
ine. In those days Jim Carr was better
off in the goods of this world than he is
now, and wben Peter's funds ran low and
there was prospect of square meals com
ing with less frequency than before, lie
allowed Maher to eat drinc and be merry
without putting up ready coin that was so
scarce.
When Maher left for the Â£ast after a
season that Jim Corbett would have desig
nated as a "dead cold frost" be owed Carr
$74 70 lor board, money advanced and
goods delivered. Not long afterward Carr
failed, and in bis list of assets filed in his
insolvency papers he included this debt.
As long as Maher was In the East boxing
with more or less pugilistic and financial
success tbat $74 70 was uncollectible, but
when Peter came to this coast and after
failing to get on a match with Choynski
decided to raise funds by knocking out a
few local men in a limited number of
rounds, Edward P. Tobin, n ho was Carr's
assignee, saw a chance to collect the
money for the creditors.
V esterday he filed a complaint in the
Justice Court, in which he demanded
judgment for the amount due, and took
out a garnishment against the box re
ceipts.
When the manager of the People's Pal
ace was served with the papers last even
ing he denied havine any money belong
ing to Maher, which was probably true
from tbe fact that Maber had not given
his exhibition and was not yet entitled to
any of the receipts.
There was no alternative, however, for
the deputy, as the garnishment specifi
cally stated that service should be made
between 7:30 and 8:45 in tbe evening, long
before the pugilists were called o.ut.
It is probable that if the garnishment
fails to land the $74 70 an order of exami
nation will be served on Maher to appear
in the Justice Court and tell something
about his belongings and wby he cannot
pay the bill.
THE BOUTS WERE TAME.
A Slim House at Maher's Exhlbi-
tlon and a Poor Show.
A scant half house full of people sat pa
tiently until 11 o'clock last nighrt in the
People's Palace with tbe expectation of
seeing Peter Maher put local heavy
weights to sleep and then had to be satis
fied with two of the tamest three-round
goes that were ever seen in this City.
No single round of tbe six reached a full
minute in duration and the show was
soundly hissed.
Joe Connelly danced around first, whUe
Maher tapped him at will, and when he
retired amid a shower of hisses, o Billy
Smith; of Australia took his place for
three one-minute rounds.
Smith tried to return Maher's gentle
taps, but the Irisb champion is both quick
and clever, and in sporting parlance "put
it all over him," taking care not to hurt
his opponent.
Shoemakers Organized.
The Pacific Coast Shoeworkers' Union was
organised last night at 915>3 Market street.
P. McKitticfc was selected as president, Lewis
Bailey as vice-president and John J. Bacon as
Bergcant-at-arms. The other officers will be
selected later. A committee was selected to
confer with the Manufacturers and Producers'
Association with the view of cc-operatlng with
the association in fostering the patronage of
home industries. The union will meet on
Saturday night to heur the committee's report.
The organization intends to work on home in
dustry lines.
