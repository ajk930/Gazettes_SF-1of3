TOM REED TALKS
TO CONSTITUENTS,
Republicans of Maine Not
Fighting a Losing
Battle.
IS NOT LIKE ALABAMA,
Where, Says the Speaker, an
Honest Election Is Not
Even a Memory.
SUCCESS OF THE PARTY SURE.
Policy of the Democrats Against All
That Makes Free, Peace, Com
fort and Prosperity.
PORTLAND. Me., Aug. 19.â The Lin
coln Club held an auspicious flag-raising
to-night, opening the local campaign. It
called on Speaker Reed, who spoke as
follows :
â¢'I come to bring you words of cheer,
encouragement and exhortation, in the
political affairs of this Nation Maine is an
important State, and has been so since
1840, and will continue to be so. We are
not like Oregon, the first State to sneak,
which gives forth its utterances before
public opinion has had time to become
fixed; or like Vermont, which is utterly
steadfast; or like Alabama, where a fair
expression of the public mind cannot be
had and where an honest election is not
even a memory.
"Here in this district we have a plain
case. The candidate who has been nomi
nated by the Democratic party is an esti
mable gentleman, and he has stated
plainly where he is, and you know where
you are. I am not personally particular
about a larger majority. [Laughter.] I
hayÂ« in the past been" satisfied with what
you have given me. but the country looks
to you to say the right thing and say it
louder. [Cheers.] We are not fighting
any losing battle. [Cheers.]
"For the cause of genuine bimetallism
there is much to be said, but this thing
which is now proposed is against all that
makes free, peace, comfort and prosperity
of this country.
"The Lincoln Club is composed of earn
est, patriotic and active young men. There
was never a time when the country de
manded greater effort in its behalf than it
demands to-day. Your efforts united
with those of the older veterans of many
other battles will give a great sound
money victory."
CHEERED BY THE CHILDREN.
t.nthutiaatic youngster* Pay Thexr Re
aped* to Major McKinley.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 19.â Major Mc-
Kihlsy worked from naif-past 9 this morn
ing till ,4 this afternoon on his letter of
acceptance. A large part of the letter is
in type ana he spent his time to-day read
ing proof and making corrections.
Ex-Labor Commissioner Lewis of this
State and several men prominent in labor
circles called on Major McKinley to-day.
Scores of children, dressed in dainty sum
mer attire, were driven on big hay wagons
to the McKinley residence this afternoon.
They cheered McKinley with all the vigor
of their fresh young voices, and both
Major and Mrs. McKinley came out on
the veranda and bowed and waved their
handkerchiefs to tie enthusiastic young
ters.
At 4:30 o'clock Major and Mrs. McKin
ley went for a drive with Mr. and Mrs.
George Frease, some of their Canton
friends.
The Populistic ana Democratic parties
of this county held their conventions in
Canton to-day. A conference committee
was appointed and a ticket made up of
Democratic and Populistic candidates.
Carl Browne, Coxey's son-in-law, was a
conspicuous figure in both conventions,
and did much to bring about the selection
of a satisfactory fusion ticket.
Many telegrams of greeting from politi
cal organization were received by Mr. Mc-
Kinley to-night.
Leopold BracoDy, a distinguished French
scuipter, who has been working on the
clay model for a marble bust of Major Mc-
Kinley at the latter's residence here for
ten days, finished his task this afternoon.
M. Bracony has made a very striking and
accurate reproduction of Major McKin
ley's face and head.
JOHN SHERMAN SPEAKS.
Question* Relating to Tariff and finance
Are Set forth. -
CINCINNATI, Ohio. Aug. 19.â The
campaign in this county was opened by
the McKinley Club with an outing at the
Zoological Gardens to-day and to-night.*
At .to-night's meeting the principal
speaker was Senator Sherman. He spoke
in a humorous and at times sarcastic
vein. His remarks were devoted more to
the tariff question than finance and on
the latter question he did not depart from
the line? of his Columbus speech. He
was heartily cheered ; by the 2000 people
present when he arose to speak at 9 o'clock
and was several times interrupted by
vigorous applause. Congressman J. M.
Bromweli and Hon. Fred Speigel also
spoke. , â

WRECKED BY MEN'S RODIES.
A freight Trnin Derailed by Running
Over four 'I ramp*.
TOPEKA, Kans., Aug. 19. â A train
wreck took place this morning at Sugar
Mills, four miles west of this city. Four
men were killed.
The train that was wrecked was an extra
freight on the Rock Island from the south
ern part of the State, carrying stock.
Four men hid themselves in the feed box
under one of the stockcars in order to
steal a ride.
At 5 o'clock this morning, just as the
train was slowly pulling on to a switch at
Sugar Mills, the box in which the men
were dropped to the track. It was at once
crushed to pieces and the six cars at the
rear end of the train were ditched.
The men in the box were instantly
killed. It is thought that they were
asleep when the accident took place.
LI HUNG CHANG'S VISIT,

Arrival.
Will Be Received by the President
at Governor's Island With
Military Pomp.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 19.â The
final arrangements for the reception of Li
Hung Chang during his stay in this coun
try were announced here to-day by Major
George W. Davis, United States army,
who came to Philadelphia and conferred
with ex-Minister to China John Russell
Young, in reference to the entertainment
of the distinguished visitor. The Em
bassador extraordinary with his suite will
arrive in New York on Friday, the 28th

On Monday, the 31st inst., the party will
be taken to West Point. Tuesday, Sep
tember 1, the Chamber of Commerce of
New York will give a reception and din
ner in honor of the great man, and on
Wednesday he will visit the city of
Brooklyn.
Mr. Young will entertain Li as his guest
in Philadelphia on Thursday, September
3. He will arrive here in the morning
and spend several hours in as pleasant a
manner as can be arranged. It is likely
that besides his extensive suite Li will be
accompanied here by the Chinese Embas
sador and suite, General Ruger, U. S. A.,
commanding the Department of the At
lantic, with his staff and a number of
naval officers.
Mayor Warwick has written to Mr.
Young, stating that the city will be
pleased to co-operate in the reception. On
the evening of Thursday Li will leave for
Washington, where he will spend two
days, and from there he will go to Niagara
Falls, afterward traveling by the Canadian
Pacific Railroad to Vancouver, where he
will embark lor China. It is said that
President Cleveland may endeavor to in
duce Li to travel to the Paciffc Slope on an
American transcontinental road and visit
Chicago, St. Louis, Omaha and Minne
apolis.
HOT-HEADED KENTUCKLANS.
Mood May Flow a* a Result of a
Woman's Letter.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Aug. 19.â The fa
mous letter purporting to nave been
written by Mrs. J. Fletcher Johnson of
this city to Governor Bradley, regarding
the appointment of Mrs. Judge Cantrill
and Mrs. S. A. Charles as delegates to the
Tennessee Centennial, is developing one
of the biggest sensations ever known in
Kentucky. S. A. Charles, husband of the
iady who was referred to in the letter to
Governor Bradley as being of no more
culture than a chambermaid, is pushing
the matter to a crisis.
He took a photographic copy of the
Governor Bradley Jetter and a letter
written by Mrs. Eugenia Duniap Potts to
a newspaper office in this city and showed
them to the managing editor. Mrs. Potts
is the society editor of this paper and
Charles expressed surprise to the editor
that he should empioy Mrs. Potts, after
the editor had said that the handwriting
of the Bradley letter and of the one known
to have been written by Mrs. Potts was
the same.
Judge George Denny, the recent Repub
lican nominee for Confess, who is a
brother-in-law of Mrs. Potts, says he will
not allow Charles or any other man to tra
duce any member of his family, that there
is not a drop of cowardly blood in the
Denny and Duniap veins, and he proposes
to defend tht< honor of his sister-in-law,
no matter what the consequences may be.
He does not talk of filing >uit, and the in
dicaiions point toward a personal en
counter between Charles and Judge
Denny. Both men are recognized as pos
sessing the most daring courage, and the
friends of both apprehend a sanguinary
encounter.
A Jtollcr fstentner launched.
PARIS, Feance, Aug. 19.â Irr the pres
ence of numerous foreign engineers and a
large crowd of onlookers, the so-called
roller steamer, the invention of M. Bazin,
a well-known marine engineer, was
launched to-day at the Cail dockyards at
St. Denis. The vessel will traverse the
Seine, cross the English Channel and go
to London.

CAN WE STAND ANOTHER FISHERMAN FOR PRESIDENT?
A FISHERMAN OUT OF LUCK.
Mr. Bryan went on a fishing excursion to-day, but he had
no good fortune. He caught not a fish. â Dispatch from Upper

UNCLE SAM WILL
REMAIN PASSIVE,
An Understanding Reached
With Spain Regard
ing Cuba.
NO ACTION AT PRESENT.
Weyier to Be Permitted to Make
a Final Effort to Crush In
surgents.
BUT THE WAR GOES BIGHT ON.
Patriots Receive Frequent Re-enforce
ments by the Landing of Fili
bustering Expeditions.
WABHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 19.-The
Secretary of State and' the President are
said now to have reached a perfect under
standing with the Spanish Government
relative to Cuba, and from sources be'
lieved to be most trnstworthy it is learned
that no further declaration of policy on
the part of the administration may be ex
pected for a reasonable time.
It can be announced by The Call, on
the authority of an Assistant Secretary of
State, who presumably knows whereof he
speaks, that Weyier would be allowed to
try his hand once more before any action
is taken by the United States looking to
the recognition of the insurgents' bellige
rency or a recommendation to Congress
for some decisive move. The administra
tion has unofficially been made cognizant
of* Spain's intentions and desires to per
form a friendly act in permitting her to
use her best efforts to bring the war to a
close.
SPAIN CAN'T CHECK IT.
Filibustering Expedition* Continue to
Land at Cuba.
HAVANA, Cuba, Aug. 19.âNotwith
standing the activity of the warships en
gaged in patrolinss the coast of the island,
the landing of filibustering expeditions
continues, and within the oast few months
the insurgents have in thia way received
much aid from sources outside the island.
The latest expedition to safely land has
got ashore on the coast of Pinar del Rio,
and the members and the supplies they
brought with them are now with the
rebels. The news of the landing of this
expedition reached here late last night.
It shows that the expedition was an im
portant one, though the place from which
it sailed is not stated.
INSURGENTS ARE ACTIVE.
Several Minor Engagements in Which
They Worry the Spanish.
HAVANA, Cuba, Aug. 19.â 1t is re
ported from Artemisa that a number of
rebels stopped a work train near Baca
nagua and attacked the military escort on
board of it. The latter, according to their
own story, made a gallant defense for
fifty-six hours, when troops who had been
sent to their assistance- arrived on the
scene and drove the rebels from their po
sitions.
The Spanish loss was six killed and
twenty-two wounded, including a lieu
tenant. The rebel losses are said to have
been heavy. The train was abandoned
and was set on fire by the rebels as soon
as the troops receded.
A superior force of rebels under Clotilde
Garcia surrounded a body of Spanish
guerrillas who were employed in protect
ing the laborers on the Guerrero estate
near Banaquises, province of Matanzas,
and attacked them from all sides.
The Spanish force was obliged to re
treat, leaving behind them, according to
the official report, twelve dead, including
the commanding officer. Eight wounded
men were carried in the retreat by their
comrades. Advices from another source
are to the effect that the Spanish losses
were much larger than stated in the
official report.
Witnesses for the Prosecution in the Trial of Jo Gregory for the Murder of Jack Littlefield as They Appeared
While Entering Weaverville After Going Over Trails From Long Ridge to Round Valley,
TO TAMPER WITH
THE WITNESSES.
An Ugly Rumor Concerning
the Trial of Joe
Gregory.
WARNED IN OPEN COURT
Friends of the Slayers of Jack
Littlefield Cautioned by
Judge Jones.
LITTLE PROGRESS IS MADE.
An Important Lesal Point Involved in
the Appearance of Attorney Tur
ner for the Defense.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Aug. 19.âIm
mediately after court had opened this
morning for the trial of Joe Gregory, ac
cused of killing Jack Littlefield, counsel
for the prosecution. C. P. Post, requested
that a further recess be granted till 3
o'clock, as he was expecting information
by wire from San Francesco regardine the
question of whether Judge Jones could
admit Attorney J. W. Turner to the bar
for the defense without the Judge incapa
citating himself in the sight of the law.
The fact that Judge Jones Him Attorney
Turner were married to sisters made
the question very important in reference
to proceeding with the case should Turner
be admitted for the defense while Judge
Jones occupied the bench.
When court reopened at 3 o'clock the
Ju<lge was unable to render a decision.
Ex-Deputy Attorney-General Sanders
suggested that they amicably agree to
proceed with the trial, stating that in his
opinion the two were of no relation, and
even should sucn be the case it would hap
pen only as a remote contingency that
such might come to the knowledge of the
Supreme Court.
Mr. Post objected, saying that as an of
ficer of tbe law he could not consent to
any error that might in the future cause a
reversal of the case. He stated, however,
that in a question of this sort he believed
Judge Jones has the power to decide,
quoting from a passage in the Goldenson
trial, and section 13, article I, of the
amendment to the constitution of Califor
nia, pages 328 and especially 334, which
contained an instance somewhat similar
in effect. It was held by the defense that
Judge Jones could not deny the motion to
admit Turner as associate counsel, which
denial would be to create much greater er
rors.
Recess was taken at 3:35 till 9:30 to
morrow morning.
In dismissing the six passed jurors Judge
Jones remarked that a rumor had come to
his ears that an attempt bad been made to
tamper with certain of the witnesses, and
added significantly that such cases would
be properly attended to.
AVALONIANS IN A PANIC.
Breaking of a Gangplank Throws a
Dozen Excursionists Into the
Water.
AVALON, Catalina Island, Aug. 19.â
There was creat excitement here yester
day afternoon when the gangplank lead
ing from the bathhouse wiiart" to the
swing wharf below collapsed when crowd
ed with people waiting to board the Pa
ioma, lying at the wharf, to go to Camp
Ban nine to witness the football game be
tween the Whittier Cadets and a picked
team from Avalon. The gangplank is
about six feet wide and probably fully
fifty people were crowded on it when it
broke away from the upper wharf.
The crash was heard at the Metropole
and all along Crescent avenue. The fran
tic screams of frightened women caused a
panic among the population and hundreds
of people rushed to the scene of the dis
aster, while scores of rowboats were
pushed rapidly toward the wharf to rescue
the people struggling in the water.
Fortunately only about a dozen â those
standing at the end of the gangplank,
which broke away â were precipitated into
the water, the others clinging to the sway
ing gangplank or crowding into the swing
wharf. A3 the fail from the top of the
main wharf to the water is several feet, it
is remarkable that no one was seriously
injured.
The women were quickly rescued, and
the men swam ashore or were picked up
in rowboats. There were a few slight
bruises and much damaged clothing, but
aside from a thorough drenching and the
nervous shock sustained, no one was the
worse for the accident. The wharf was
speedily repaired, so that by the time the
boats returned from the football game pas
sengers were landed as usual.
Slight Earthquake Shock.
LICK OBSERVATORY, Cal., Aug. 19.-
A slight shock of earthquake was felt here
last night at 11 hours, 0 minutes, 13 sec
onds. Pacific standard time. The shock
was too light to be noticed by parsons in
motion.

TYPESETTERS' WAR
IN SACRAMENTO,
The State Printing Office
Inquiry Causing Much
Trouble.
ALMOST A FIST FIGHT.
Governor Budd's Expert Was
Turned Down by the
Board.
ELY HAD ROGERS ARRESTED.
Difference of Opinion as to Whether
the Investigation Should Be
Made.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., s>ug. 19.â Gov
ernor Budd's appointmeut of C. M. Har
rison as expert to inquire into the work
ings of the State Printing Office has cre
ated a perfect furor of excitement in
typographical circles, has led to wars and
rumors of wars in other directions and
may result in strained relations between
the various State officials who are directly
and indirectly interested in the matter.
At the meeting of the local Typographical
Union last night there was consid
erable trouble, and President Ely was
repeatedly threatened with personal vio
lence at the hands of excited men bera
of the guild.
Ely is the reputed cause of Harrison's
appointment, havJng, it is claimed, car
ried distorted statements to Governor
Budd as to the manner in which the State
printing establishment was conducted,
and thereby induced his Excellency to
demand an investigation. Eventually Mr.
Ely talked himself out of a job, and last
night, by his unfairness in ruling on
questions pertaining to the set of resolu
tions condemning the action of the State
Typographical Union, as published in
The Call yesterday, was by motion re
moved from the chair and Vice-President
Nelson H. Murry substituted.
This morning Charles J. Nangle, who it
is claimed belongs to the opposition and ia
a stanch adherent of President Ely, ap
peared at the police station and swore out
two complaints against H. Kodgcrs, fore
man of the State Printing Office, charging
him with battery and threats to commit
great bodily injury. Rodgers was arrested
and promptly furnished bonds, two of tha
leading business men of the city, George
H. Mott, manager of Crocker & Co., and
John Batcher, as sureties.
At the meeting of the State Board of
Examiners this afternoon, represented by
Secretary of State Brown and Deputy At
torney-General Anderson, Expert Harri
son was coldly greeted when he made bis
appearance, and upon requesting per
mission to examine the bills of the Stata
Printer was informed by Anderson that,
under the opinion rendered by the Attor
ney-General, at the request of Governor
Budd, he could not be permitted by the
board to exercise the functions of the office
to which he had been appointed.
Secretary of State Brown then forcibly
expressed the opinion that there was
nothing for the expert to do, and stated
that he was strongly opposed to the ap
pointment of an expert who was the op*
ponent of the office-holder, both politically
and in business, and who could not help
being prejudiced.
"Mountains are sometimes made out of
molehills,'' contiuued the Secretary of
State, "and a big stirring-up is effected to
create talk. Nothing comes of it, but the
smirch is left on the name of the office
holder."
Anderson sent to the Governor's office
for the opinion of the Attorney-General
wnich barred Harrison. When it came,
Brown read a portion of it aloud, then
stated that it was evident there was noth
ing for the expert to do.
Harrison remained seated for a few mo
ments, then said, "Well, that is satisfac
tory, gentlemen," and left.
Following is the opinion as rendered:
San Fbancisco, Aug. 13, 1896.
Hon. James H. Sudd, Governor of the State of
California, Sacramento, Cal.â Dear Sir: In re
ply to your favor of the 23d ult., requesting an
opinion as to the duties of the printing ex
pert, whom the Board of Examiners is author
ized by section 679 of the Political Code to ap
point, I am of the opinion that the duties of
such expert are those, and those only, pre
scribed by section 679 of the Political Code,
viz: "to examine and report to the board all
accounts for printing presented by tne Stata
Printer or any other person, specifying whether
the work has been executed in a workmanlike
manner or Dot, and the amount for which the
same should be allowed."
In view of the fact that the work in tha2
State Printing Office is no longer done by
piecework, and that the State no longer esti
mates "the amount for which the same shall be
allowed,"that portion of the section which re
quires the printing expert to "examine and re
port to the board all accounts for printing
presented by the State Printer," has, oi course,
been rendered inoperative.
It, therefore, follows that the only duties
which the printing expert is now authorized
to perform are: "To examine and report to the
board all accounts for printing presented by
the State Printer or any other person, specify
ing whether the work ha? been executed in a
â workmanlike manner or not, and the amount
for which the seme should be allowed," and
the only provision in the statutes of the State
which permits the superintendent of State
printing to procure work from, "any other per
son" is that found in section 538 of the Politi
cal Code.which provides that "when any chart,
map, diagram or other engraving shall be re
quired to illustrate any document ordered to
be printed, such chart, map, diagram or en
graving shall berprocured by the superintend
ent of State printing." Respectfully ,
\V. 1". Fitzgerald, Attorney-General.
At the present time Governor Budd is
absent on an outing trip among the
Sierras, and speculation is rife as to what
action he will take on the question upon
his return. In the meantime the matter
is the topic of conversation "in printing
circles and the outcome is being looked
forward to with great interest.
NATIONALITY CONVENTION.
It Is Denounced as a Delusion by Tim
othy Healy's Supporters.
DUBLIN, Ireland, Aug. 19.â At a meet
ing of the supporters of Timothy fiealy,
held in this city last night, a resolution
was adopted denouncing the coming Na
tionalist convention as a mere attempt of
John Dillon to bolster up his own lead
ership and to promote his personal ambi
tion. Another resolution was adopted ex
pressing satisfaction that the Irish land
bill had been passed by Parliament.
Healy declared that so long as Dillon
â¢was at the head of the Nationalist party it
would never achieve success.
Murphy, the chairman, denounced the
convention as a delusion and a snare for
Irishmen in foreign countries.
MORE ARTILLERY NEEDED
Fortifications Tnat Will Neces
sitate an Additional Force
of Caretakers.
Only One Regipent to Man All the
Proposed Defenses of the Pa
cific Coast.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Aug. 19.-The
New York Sun confirms The Call's Wash
ington dispatch foreshadowing many
changes in artillery stations and says:
Portland will be among the barbo'rs de
manding increas-ed defenses, and now it
has only a single Dattery. Boston and
New York, as is known, are to have great
increases in their defensive works, and
must accordingly have more artillerymen.
The approach to Philadelphia is among
the points to be fortified, and it has now
no garrison. The same is true of Charles
ton and Savannah, where guns, it is
hoped, will ere long be in position.
At San Francisco, Point Lobos, Lime
Point, Alcatraz Island, Angel Sound and
Black Point are to be well fortified, while
Puget Sound is an important strategic
area which could easily be commanded
by shore batteries. Of minor importance
just now, yet included in the general
scheme of defense, is San Diege, near the
Mexican frontier, at present garrisoned
by an infantry company.
The artillery regiment now on the
Pacific Coast is the Fifth, and which has
Batteries A, C, I, L and M and Ligbt Bat
teries D and F at the Presidio of San
Francisco, B and X at Alcatraz Island,
E at Fort Mason and H at Fort Can by, at
the moutb of the Columbia. Battery Gis
on the Atlantic coast at Fort Monroe.
But the difficulty is to say how any re
distribution can be made to advantage. It
has been reported that another regiment
is to be sent to the Pacific Coast, but that
would be preposterous, not only because it
would strip existing forts on the Atlantic
and Gulf of garrisons they now have and
certainly need, but also because the pro
portion of two regiments on the Pacific to
three on the Atlantic coast and Gulf
would be absurd. The present ratio of
one regiment on the Western and four on
tue Eastern coast is about right, in view of
the relative magnitude of the interests to
be defended.
When the artillery is increased, as,
sooner or later, it will unquestionably be,
more batteries will be available.
One important matter to be remembered
is that the new batteries thus spoken of
are affairs of the future. A few heavy
guns and mortars have been mounted at
New York, San Francisco and Boston, but
the work of engineers on emplacements
has so far dragged behind that of the
ordnance department in providing guns,
and the work of the latter in furnishing
carriages is so far behind, the turning out
of guns, that Congress has not been with
out an excuse in delaying to increase the
artillery arm. When it sees more new
guns actually mounted it will probably
provide men to take care of them ; but it
is reluctant to increase the army for purely
prospective uses. One of the reasons, also,
why a redistribution would apparently be
out of place now is that barracks and
quarters must be provided in season for
such changes. Such a provision is now
going on, for example, at Sandy Hook.
Another question is as to the manner in
which the artillery arm should be in
creased. One statement is that General
Miles is desirous of having batteries scat
tered among a greater number of points in
order to have more forts garrisoned. But
tbe bill pending in Congress proposes to
increase five regiments to seven, whereas
a former measure was based on the idea of
simply adding more batteries on the
ground that it was additional batteries
that were required and not additional
regimental organizations. Still, these
latter are also advocated on the ground
that they will furnish more promotion,
while preserving the three - battalion
twelve-company idea.
Altogether it would seem that there is
no immediate need of redistributing artil
lery and that the most sensible and
economical plan would be to a>vait tbe
action of Congress at the coming session
on Secretary Lamont's line reorganization
bill.
If that bill, or even the artillery part of
it, becomes a law the assignment of gar
risons to the new batteries hereafter to be
built wiil be an easy task.
Some interesting experiments will soon
be made in the manufacture of ordnance
material. Under a recent action of Con
gress provision was made for the manu
facture and trial of a ten-inch counter
poise carriage, invented by Commodore
Howell of the navy, and of a twelve-inch
carriage invented by A. H. Emery. Still
another provision was that for making and
casting an eight-incfe jrun, to be cast in one
piece, on the plan of R. J. Gatling. As to
the carriages, of whatever their intrinsic
merits, it will be a gain if they serve to
hurry forward the twelve-inch type car
riage now under construction.

SARATOGA, N. V., Aue. 19.âConven
tion Hall was more than comfortably
packed with representative members of
the bar from all portions of the United
States at 10:30 o'clock this morning, when
Hon. Moorfield Storey of Massachusetts
called to order the nineteenth annual con
vention of the American Bar Association.
Just before tne commencement of
proceedings Lord Chief Justice Russell
of England, accompanied by Sir Frank
Lockwood, Q. C, M. P., and Mon
tague Crackenthorpe, Q. C, were
escorted to the platform, the conven
tion rising en masse to give the dis
tinguished visitors an enthusiastic greet
ing. Prominent among the legal lights
present were Francis Rawle of Phila
delphia; James C. Carter, New York;
Charles Clafiin Allen, Missouri; George
M. Sharp, Baltimore; Emlin McLain,
lowa City, Iowa; J. Randolph Tucker,
Lexington, Va. ; Hon. Thomas^ M. Cooley,
Ann Arbor, Mich.; William Allen Butler,
New York; J. M. Woolworth, Nebraska;
Thomas J. Semmes, New Orleans; John
W. Stevenson, Kentucky; Courtlandt
Parker, New Jersey ; Joseph B. Warner,
Massachusetts.
The subject of the address of the presi
dent was, "The most noteworthy changes
in statute law on points of general inter
est made in the several States and by
Congress during the preceding year."
The speaker pointed out that the legis
lation in different States, though widely
separated, strongly showed the essential
unity of this country in dealing with the
same problems that confront all the States.
Another noticeable point is the rapid
growth of a disposition to assert the gen
eral interests of the community at the ex
pense of individual freedom. The statutes
of every State, he said, contain laws that
would have seemed unwarrantable inva
sions of private rights not many years ago.
The most important point of the address
is devoted to railway reorganization, and
is based upon a statute of Kentucky,
which for the first time attempts to deal
with this subject.
The speaker considered thi3 statute a
step in the right direction, as it enables
the courts to protect the interests of the
investors by making every reorganization
of a railway the subject of judicial inves
tigation and securing for every interest a
hearing. It often happened, he said, that
capital stock was issued without payment,
being offered as a bonus to ko with the
bonds. In this way the money of credi
tors has been invested and the control of
the property retained by the debtor â the
railway company.
The managers of railway companies are
generally prepared for an emergency when
it is found necessary to reorganize their
property, but the creditors are scattered,
frightened end wholly unprepared to act.
The managers of the insolvent company
asK the court for a receiver and generally
get one favorable to their own Interests.
Sometimes the receivers resist foreclosure
proceedings, which action results in a
practical denial of justice.
Many a man sees the savings of a life
time swept away by the mismanagement
of a corporation and sees the managers in
charge in spite of all opposition that
creditors can make. It is to the courts
that we must look for protection, the
president continued. Their authority
rests on the respect of the people for their
absolute impartiality, and in the lone ran
they cannot preserve that respect unless
they observe the weli-settied rules of
judicial procedure and unless they respect
and enforce every legal claim. Parties
must be left to determine for themselves
whether their interests will or wi!l not be
served by the assertion of their rights. If
the courts had always refused to entertain
these applications for receivers when
made by a debtor corporation, or even if
they had selected impartial receivers and
facilitated the enforcement of every agree
ment, railroads would have been reorgan
ized more promptly and on a more endur
ing basis than is now possible.
In concluding his address President
Storey said : "Judicial action which im
pairs the obligation of contracts is more
dangerous than any statute which aims at
the same result. When the court, throagh
its officers, undertakes to manage a rail
road for years, and that chiefly without
hearing the questions which arise in its
operation; when it appoints these officers
and in so doing grants the final relief
sought without notice it violates the
fundamental rule of our constitution."
The address of President Storey, which
required an hour and a half in delivering,
was frequently applauded.
The regular business was then taken up.
Upon the report of the executive com
mittee eighty-eight new members from
various States were elected. A recess of
ten minutes was then taken, during which
tima Lord Rusaell, Sir Frank Lockwood
and Montague Crackenthorpe held an in
formal reception on the platform, where
they greeted many members of the asso
ciation.
The convention then proceeded to the
election of the members of the General
Council, among those selected being the
following: California, J. A. Gibjon; Colo- I
rado, C. F. Herrington; Illinois, E. B. j
Sherman; lowa, A. J. McCreary; Kansas,
J. D. Mulligan; Missouri. James Hager
man ; Montana, W. F. Sanders; Nebraska,
J. L. Woolworth; North Dakota, Burke
Corbett; Oregon, C. H. Corey; South
Dakota, J. W. Wright; Washington, C. A.
Snepard; Wyominir, C. Carter; Arizona,
E. E. Elienwood; Utah, S. B. bhepard.
The report of Secretary Hinkiey of Bal
timore for the year showed that there were
1307 members at the close of the last meet
ing. Thirty-five members have been
elected by the executive committee. All

of the States except Nevada and all of the
Territories except New Mexico are repre
sented in the membership. The attention
of tbe vice-presidents and members of the
local councils was again called to the reso
lution charging them with the duty of
endeavoring to secure by legislation the
appointment of commissioners of uniform
State law.
The report of the treasurer for the year
showed tbe total receipts to have been
$6119 62, disbursements $5,756 67, leaving
a balance of $4133 53. The report was re
ceived and , submitted to tbe auditing
committee.
An adjournment was then taken to 8
o'clock.
By reason of the reception given by
Judge Batchelder in honor of Lord Rus
sell the evening session of the Bar Asso
ciation was made somewhat short; The
first speaker, James W. Woolworth of
Omaha, Nebr., discussed the development
of the law of contracts. The paper was a
most exhaustive one, and held the close
attention of the large audience.
At the close Joseph B. Warner of Bos
ton, Mass., spoke on "The Lawyer's Rela
tions to His Client."
The association then adjourqed until
10:30 to-morrow morning.
ON LEGAL EDUCATION.
Chairman McLain Talk* to the "Law
Curriculum."
SARATOGA, N. V., Aug. 19.â At 3:30
the association met as a section of legal
education in Convention Hall. Chairman
McLain delivered an address to tbe "Law
Curriculum." After briefly reviewing the
origin and growth of the section of legal
education and discussing the best methods
to be pursued by the law student in his
legal education Chairman McLain con
tinued:
"It must be admitted that the quickness
of perception and the maturity of judg
ment, without which legal attainments
are impossible, may be strengthened, on
tbe one hand by the studies which are
deemed proper in a broad liberal and
thorough collegiate education, but also on
the other by familiarity with the practical
affairs. Therefore, great as is the advantage
to be derived from college training, we
must notienore the corresponding advan
tage which may have been obtained by
business experience.
"I cannot refrain from saying a word as
to textbooks â for whatever the theory of
instruction may be, textbooks will be
found useful on some topics. We have
special books in abundaace. We have
voluminous collections of cases and brief
synopses of principles. And if lam not
mistaken some of the old-fashioned law
yers' books remain the best textbooks for
students on their particular subjects. In
no portion of the law is the skill of an
accomplished lecturer, or perhaps I should
say expounder, more valuable than in this
beginning work of the student's course.
"Two important topics of the law which
undoubtedly ought to be introduced into
the first year's course, inasmuch as they
lie at the foundation' of so many collateral
subjects, are those of contracts and torts.
Sufficient knowledge of the elementary
principles applicable to the ownership of
real and personal property may be given
in the course of elementary law, to enable
the student without detriment to dispense
with tue thorough treatment of these
topics until his second year. Criminal
law is a subject involving elementary con
ceptions easily mastered by a student, and
both in its substantive part and its proce
dure it is well suited to presentation in
the first year's course. For the second
year's work the more important subjects
are real and personal property law. For
the third year I would propose corpora
tion law and the law cf partnership; also
constitutional law, international law. con
flict of laws and genera! instruction."
NICOLLETTI NOT PROSECUTED.
By the Dismissal of the Vender's Case
His Popvlistic Friends Are
Silenced.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Aug. 19.â Long
before the Police Court opened this morn
ing groups of men wearing long whiskers
and Bryan buttons stood in the corridor
and discussed politics. When Policeman
Mike Flynn arrived be demanded their
business and to a man they replied: "We
are here to defend Stephen Nicolletti."
Nicolletti is the Populistic martyr of
Los Angeles who was arrested Saturday
for obstructing the street with a push cart
containing free silver literature of his
own manufacture, warranted to extermi
nate the gold-bag pest now raging in the
East. When Prosecutor Pugh unrolled his
desk this morning Flyun approached on
tip-toe and asked him to take a peep in
the courtroom. Mr. Pugh looked through
the door and beheld row after row of
bearded men, apparently, from their secre
tive actions, conspiring with each other.
"The silver mm, Pugh," said Flynn, "here
to defind the Eyetallyun Nickerletty."
But, alas, for the eloquence of the hirsute
howlers, Nicolletti has yet to pose before
the public as the new monetary Messiah,
and Push, prosecutor, did it all with an
insignificant little stamp in his otiice
marked "Nolle prosse qui." The Populists
swear that he nolle prossed the case so
they could not make speeches.

the Boy Orator of the River
Platte Region.
UPPER RED HOOK, N. V., Aug. 19.â
New YorK State is to be partly canvassed
by W. J. Bryan before his return West.
His programme is not yet complete ana
may be changed somewhat, but so far as
has been arranged it was summed up in
the following statement, dictated this
morning by Bryan himself:
"We shall leave Tarry town at 6:56 Tues
day afternoon, tne 25th, reaching Albany
at 8:30 p. m. ; leave there at 10 o'clock
that night and arrive at Syracuse
at 2:05 a. m. ; stay until noon Wednes
day; reach Rochester about 2:25 p. M. ;
stop one hour, leaving for Buffalo in time
to reach there at 4:45 p. m. ; take the first
train to Erie, Pa., arriving there early in
the evening. At Erie I will attend a meet
ing of the State Democratic clubs on the
26th. I will return next morning to
Buffalo, and remain the rest of the week
in Western New York. I will spend Sun
day at Chautauqua and proceed west
Wednesday morning."
Telegrams from many places in New
York inviting the young candidate to
make addresses have been received by
Bryan, but he has been obliged to dccl me
many of the requests. What Bryan will
do when in the western part of the State
he is not yet ready to announce, but will
do so within a day or two.
Without expectation or preparation,
Bryan made a speech at Rhinebeck to
night in which he touched on matters of
interest in the campaign. It was the first
political talk Mr. Bryan has riven since
his notification a week ago to-day, with
the exception of a few words at Pough
keepsie.
At 2 o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Bryan and
Mr. and Mrs. Perrine, their hosts, left
Upper Red Hook in a covered wagon to
drive over to Ellerslie, Governor Morton's
home. With them went the Misses Per
rine and a number of friends in vehicles
and on bicycles. Others joined them along
the road, and by the time Ellerslie was
reached the procession was quite formida
ble. The route was tbrougk Red Hook, or
the lower village, past the estates of John
Jacob .Astor, John Armstrong Chanlerand
other persons of wealth, and through
Khineciiffe to Governor Morton's stock
farm.
Mr. Bryan and his friends inspected the
stable and dairy-nouses under escort of
Governor Morton's superintendent, who
had been instructed from Albany by the
Governor's private secretary, Colonel Ash
ley W. Cole, to show the candidate every
attention.
Leaving Ellerslie, Mr. Bryan and his
parly visited the estate of Colonel Jacob
Ruppert, the brewer, and then started for
Rhinebeck, where they were to have sup
per. On the way Mr. Bryan was waylaid
by Rev. Mr. Richard*, pastor of the Hiil
side|Methodist Church, and invited to visit
the church fair in progress in a tent near
by, which lie accepted. Rhinebeck people
were on the lookout for the Democratic
candidate. He had telephoned to have
dinner for himself and friends at 6 o'clock,
and when he arrived he found the ancient
Rbinebeck Hotel, where the meal had
beeu ordered, decorated with bunting in
his honor. Not only that, but a reception
committee was awaiting him, and they
had a brass band and were prepared to do
honor to his present prominent position.
There were Republicans as well as Demo
crats on the committee, and Mr. Bryan
was informed tnat the reception was in
tended to be entirely non-partisan.
Three hundred people gathered in front
of the hotel and appiauded when Mr.
Bryan stepped upon the decorated bal
cony. He was introduced by George LÂ»
Esselstyne, a prominent Republican, who
is sometimes called the "golden-ton gued
orator of Northern Duchess." Mr. Essel
stynesaid: "We appear here altogether
in an impromptu gathering. Many cen
turies ago it was said that to be a Roman
was greater than to be a King, and it can
be said to-day that to be President of the
United States is to be greater than to be
either a Roman or a King. Irrespective
of either party or other considerations we
extend you a hearty welcome."
To this Mr. Bryan replied:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: I
think that I can go farther even than the
chairman of this impromptu meeting. He
says that to be President of the United States
Is to be greater than to be a Roman or a king.
But few can be President, and I rejoice that I
live in a land where to be a citizen is more
than to be a king In any nation on earth. I
rejoice tnat I live in a land where those who,
for a time being, exercise authority and derive
that authority from the consent of the gov
erned and who do not rule by right divine. In
this land, whether we live along the Hudson
or on the Western prairies, we stand upon a
common plane and we participate in a gov
ernment which represents us all.
We may belong to different parties, but I
trust I may be able to express the desire of
each of you as well as myself when I say that
we ought to Delong at all times to that party
which in our judgment will enable us best to
serve our country. Parties are instruments,
not ends. They are the means we use to
secure that which we believe to be best for us,
for our families and for our fellows. Issues
arise from time to time, and it is the duty of
every citizen who loves his country and who
appreciates the responsibilities which rest
upon him to s;udy each Issue as it arises.
I am not here to-night to make you a politi
cal speech. I am in your midst to rest, but I
cannot withstand the temptation at this time
to beg that you will study, If you have not
done it heretofore, that issue which in this
campaign is paramount. 1 know that among
our neighbors in the East there are many who
have regarded our position upon the money
question ; the position taken by the Chicago
convention as entirely wrong, and they speak
of the silver sentiment as a source of disease.
I want to beg you, my friends, to believe
that we who advocate the restoration of the
money of the constitution are not seeking that
policy because we believe thai It Is going to
give us an advantage over somebody else.
We have studied the question as best we
could and we honestly believe that there can
be no permanent, no general prosperity in this
country, until we stop the conspiracy of those
who would make gold the only standard of
the world and make all other thingÂ« depend
upon th&t alone. We believe that while tee
struggle for gold goes on other things must
become cheap; that as we increase the de
mand for that one thing we must decrease the
price of all those things that we change lor
gold, and we believe that this falling of prices,
compelled by legislation, is destructive of en
ergies, the industries and the hope of the toil
ing masses of the United States and all over the
world. [Applause.]
I beg of you, when you are considering this
question, to remember that this is a great Na
tion; that it la made up of 70,000,000 people.
Each is the equal of every other. I have vis
ited some of your beautiful villas along the
Hudson. I have been charmed with the
Deauty that commends them, but I beg you,
when you study this question, to remember
that those who, instead of occupying these
magnificent p:aces, must toil all day under the
summer sun, have just as much interest in the
money question as anyoody else.
Remember that this question cannot be
viewed from the standpoint of any class of
people. It reaches every man, woman and
child in the land, and you should make your
view broad enough to comprehend them all,
because I believe I speak the truth when I say
that the prosperity of the well-to-do rests upon
the prosperity of those who toil and that you
cannot have a financial policy which brings
distress to those who create wealth without in
the end reaching those who rest upon these
toilers ; and more than that, you cannot have
a policy which brines prosperity to the masses
without that prosperity proving of benefit to
all mankind.
I beg you that In your consideration of this
question you will study the interests of all and
not merely the interests of those who may be
permanently benefited by the rise in the value
of a dollar, and when you have made up your
mind I desire each of you to feel that you have
the right to express your view. The ballot
was not given in order that one man should
vote for many or that one man should compel
others to vote with him or purchase their
votes. It was given in order that each might
make his ballot represent a free man's will,
and then, when each one, studying as he will,
voting as he likes, expresses himself, we make
a majority, and then we all support the one
who is elected and hold up his hands while he
administers for us the Government, whether
we agree with his views or not.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan and Mr. and Mrs.
Perrine had an eight-mile ride through the
moonlight from Rhinebeck to Upper Red
Hook. It was late when they reached the
home of the Perrines.
ACCEPTS BRYAN'S WORD.
Thurston Aojp Belieres the -Ne.br ask an
Was Xot Paid by Mine-Owner*.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 19.â Before leav
ing for New York to-night Senator Thurs
ton accepted as conclusive proof of the
falsity of tbe charge the statement made
yesterday by Mr. Bryan that he had never
been in the employ of silver-mine owners
or silver associations. Senator Thurston
at Madison, Wis., recently quoted the
charge as originally made in the editorial
columns of the Chicago Chronicle, and
called on Mr. Bryan to say if the accusa
tion was true or false. The Senator said
to-day :
"Mr. Bryan's word is enough for me
and I shall be glad to say as much to the
people of the country in my next public
address. Mr. Bryan has denied the charge,
which was made by a Democratic news
paper, and I have no hesitation in believ
ing him."
As to Senator Stewart, the Nebraska
Senator said: "Senator Stewart has ar
rived at that state of political second child
hood which entitles him to great consid
eration and sympathy and I don't think
any more need be said on that score."
Executive Conimitteeman Darbin, whose
special work in the National campaign is
to visit Western States and examine the
methods and progress of conducting the
State campaigns, left to-day for Detroit,
where he will meet the chairman of the
Michigan committee and other campaign
officials in that State and report the result
of his investigation to National headquar
ters.
Henry C. Payne received reports to-day
from numerous officers of party organiza
tions on the Pacific Coast, all of which in
dicated a rapid growth of gold standard
and protection sentiment. Wyoming is
also giving the headquarters people some
encouragement.
United States Senator Wolcott of Colo
rado stopped a short time at headquarters
on his way West. He said he was making
no predictions as to his State further than
to say that McKinley would get a safe
majority.
A letter from W. A. E. Debeque of
Debeque, Colo., says that peculiar con
ditions exist in the rural districts of his
State, and that old Republicans are com
ing back as much on protection as the
money issue.
Chief Hahn of the speakers' bureau had
several callers to-day who had been speak
ing in the West, and they reported larger
audiences than they had known in pre
vious campaigns, the chief interest being
to obtain full infoi-mation on the money
question.
WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED.
But That Will Xot Affect Watson's Can-
dldacj at All.
WASHINGTON D. C, Aug. 19.âUn
less the wishes of Chairman Butler and
the members of the executive committee
are set aside Watson, the Populist candi
date for the "Vice-Presidency, will not be
officially notified of his nomination for
that place. Chairman Butler last night,
while declining to make any specific
statements on the subject, said that the
failure to notify would not be unusual,
for the reason that the Populists had
never yet notified their candidates.
Chairman Butler denied that any pool
ing arrangements for circulation of litera
ture had been arranged between the
Democrats and Populists, but intimated
that they would work together in the ut
most harmony. It was decided by the
committee last night that there should be
one head for the Populist Executive Com
mittee and Congressional Committee.
Senator Butler will therefore preside over
all work.

ally devote much attention to the details
of the campaign except on the Pacific
Coast, where he will have sole control of
the canvass. He hopes to come east in
October and spend the closing month of
the contest, a portion of the time being in
this city. Details of the work here, Mr.
Stevens says, have not been fully arranged.
It was noon before the Populist execu
tive committee met to begin the session

of Pueblo, for the purpose of raising a fund
to send speakers into the East to present
free-coinage arguments before labor or
ganizations, the convention took a recess
until 10 p. m., at which time committees
on resolutions and order of business will
report.
The delegates have arrived at nodefin ite
plan for making overtures of fusion with
Silverites of other parties, whose conven
tions meet next month, and they cannot
agree upon a plan in caucus. They are
willing to agree to indorse Senator Teller
and Congressmen Bell and Shafroth for
re-election, but on all other points great
diversity of views are extant. Whether
by a committee with delegated power or
by an adjournment of the convention to
meet again the fusion ticket is to be pre
pared only a vote in the convention can
determine.
The situation of the convention is made
more perplexing by reason of numerous
gubernatorial candidates in the field
whose respective friends are working to
save them in the fusion compromise.
Tn"e two committees will jointly report
indorsing Teller, Bell and Shafroth.
Then a committee of seven will be named,
with full power to act jointly with other
parties, to effect a union of silverites upon
fusion tickets. Before this convention ad
journs, however, a full State ticket is to be
named, from which the committee must
select all candidates given to the Demo
crats upon such a fusion ticket.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions was adopted; but before the report
of the committee on order of business,
which includes the fusion question, was
considered, the convention adjourned upon
arollcall at 11:30.
WORRIES THE SILVER WING.
Preparation for the Convention of the
Rational Democracy Proceeds.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 19.â The
leaders of the National Democracy feel
very much encouraged over the outlook of
the convention of September 22. A strong
evidence of the concern it is giving the
silver wing was contained in a story
printed by the free-silver papers this
morning in a special dispatch from
Canton, declarine that the McKinley
managers were making a strenuous effort
to have the Indianapolis convention in
dorse the Republican nominee, in answer
to a request from a New York paper for
his opinion upon this proposition of in
dorsement, Mr. Bynum, chairman of the
National Democratic executive commit
tee, wired: "The convention that meets
on September 22 will be Democratic. It
will adopt a Democratic platform and
nominate Democratic candidates."
Most of the men influential in the Cleve
land administration have given what en
couragement they could to the movement
and it is said that the money plank of the
platform will be written by Secretary Car
lisle. Nothing direct has been heard from
President Cleveland, but tne attitude of
those near him is taken by tbe leaders of
the movement as a sign that it has his *
support.
Tne local preparations for the conven
tion are going right along without an in
terruption. The local committee has col
lected sufficient funds to meet the ex
penses of the gathering, and the hall com
mittee has completed its plans. Ample
arrangements hare been made by the
press committee and the telegraph com
panies to handle newspaper matter with
facility and dispatch.

MAY FUNE WITH REPUBLICANS,
Populists of Texas Vppoted to the
Tactics of Democrats.
FORT WORTH, Tex., Aug. 19. âThe
State Democratic Convention reconvened
at 9 o'clock this morning. Hon. C. L.
Fotterof Cook County was elected per
manent chairman without opposition.
The convention voted almost unanimously
to abolish the two-thirds rule under which
the party has always worked. It also
voted to nominate the three Railroad Com
missioners at once.
A committee representing the Texas
Populist party called on Chairman Dudley
of the State Democratic Executive Com
mittee and requested that he appoint a
similar committee of his party to confer
on a proposition to fuse on the electoral
ticket, composed of seven Populists and
thirty-eight Democrats. Dudley refused
to appoint such a committee. The Popu
lists now threaten to fuse with the Repub
licans, giving their vote to the Republi
can electors in return for Republican votes
for the Populist State ticket.

The contest over the estate of Mrs.

Judge Clark to-day. There has been con
siderable wrangling between some of the
; heirs of the deceased and several contests
I hare been filed during the past year. It
I was not known until the hearing this
morning whether they would still remain
in the fight. .;- ..'"; . ,';..,-/:â â¢â 
Mrs. Huber was over 80 years old at the
i time of her death, in.Ausust.- 1393, and
j left property Talued at about $50,000. She
was the mother of Mrs. Emetine Child 3,

Having been executed in November, 1894.

A MEXICAN CONSULATE
Suggestion* of the Lâ Angeles Chamber
of Commerce.'.
LOS ANGELES, , Cal., Aug. 19.â The
Chamber of Commerce has issued a re
port to show why a Mexican Consulate
should' *be established in this city. \
Questions have been asked of different
firms engaged in commercial transactions .
between this city and .Mexico.
F. M. Edelston of the Mining and
Metallurgical Journal writes: "We could :
build up a very large business in handling
Mexican mines, which are the largest in
the world, if we had better relations with
Mexico. We nave a large amount of Los
Angeles capital invested in Mexico, 5 and
more would go in if there were means of
gettinÂ» better data about the commerce."
W. E. Harrad writes : "Mexico is the
richest mineral district . on ; the . coast. â¢
They need ; us and we need t!iem, but it
devolves upon us to demonstrate this fact.
However, I am persuaded that they, are
alive to the situation and open to convic
tion. If reasonable inducements were
held out the Lower California Develop
ment Company would' run tfteir boat as
far north as this point, or arrangements
could be made with the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company to make Los An.-eles

Ram-y falling under the horse and being ;
kicked and also run over by the wagon. |
He moved to Los Gatos from lowa about \

Los Gatq6, CaL, Aug. : |
This was "Congress day" for the major
ity of the memÃers of Company B, brt it
did not partake at all of a legislative char
acter. It w*s qnite the contrary, for the
gallant guardsmen and the ladies who are
visiting camp, bat stopping at hotels, took
to the woods and the picnic grounds near
Congress Springs, about five miles west of
Los Gatos; hence the name '"Congress
day."
They started about 10 o'clock in the
morning and drove out in more than half
a dozen three and four-?eated surreys and
other reniclea. One surrey carried four
men in a seat, and there were not less
than three in a seat in the entire proces
sion. They also carried cold solid and
liquid provisions, and plenty of them,
sandwiches, nard-boiled eggs, lemons to
make lemonade with, pie, etc, and for
fruitâ weli. if the plain truth must be told
of a sotdier's outing, they got p'enty of
plums and peaches by the roadside.
The drive was along a beautiful road
through orchards heavily laden with
fruit. The odors of flowers and pines and
ripe fruit tilled the air. Off to the iefi the
vineyards, orchards and wheat fields ex
tended high up tbe mountaid sides. The
company baglersat on the front seat of the
front wagon and trumpeted merrily his
lay, which awoke t. c echoes ia the hills.
It was a delightful drive.
The day under the trees was none tbe
less pleasant. Lunch was served by Quar
termaster Clifford soon after the company
reached the grounds. It was spread on
the broad tables under the trees. The con
versation was merry and the laughter fre
quent as the eatables passed rapidly from
the sceue to the unseen. When the rem
nants were cleared away the picnickers
either repaired to tbe dancing platform,
where the company string band was al
ready getting its instruments in tune or
strolled in couples down the ralley of the
little creek, which purled gently by the
side of the picnic grounds. There was over
an hocf of dancing and then all followed
a shady iane to the springs up
on tbe hill side. The maximum
of mineral water was consumed by Dr.
Sieoerst, Quartermaster-General Clifford
and Guardsman OsthoS. but the minimum
was plenty ior everybody else. Oa the re
turn to toe picnic grounds the stroll had
its romantic as well as its sylrsn side.
The entire company returned to came
about 5 o'clock delighted with the day's
outing. But before tbe start was made in
the morning tbe bo> shad their usual early
morning work at company and extended
order drill from 7 to BJO o'clock. The
drilling is done in the eariy morning so as
to escape the heat of the day. Dress
parade was held at 5:30 o'clock on Rail
road square, with the usual large crowd
of Los Gatos spectators. For these parades
the guardsmen put on their swell dress
coats and tbeir helmets. They are a
handsome body c-f young men. The large
number of Los Gatos young ladies who
look on is mute and beautiful evidence of
tbat fact. In regard to the way the com
pany is drilling Captain Fiimer said to
day :
"The drill this morning was almost en
tirely extended order. Tne boys are doing
finely. When they came off the field they
were* perspiring freely, and still they
wanted more. They advance and retreat
in fine style. At the command 'chare*'
they rush* down the field yelling like a
band of Indians. At the command "fire*
they hare been merely snapping tbeir
gun'i. To-morrow morning I snail give
them a few rounds of blank cartridges and
let them do a little firing. They are all
willing and hard workers in the drill. I
am entirely satisfied. "
Either in the forenoon or afternoon of
Friday the sham battle will take place.
Company D takes as much interest ia this
event as do the people of Los Gatos, aud
their curiosity is far from small. Tbe bat
tle will follow the same general plan as
tbe sham battle had by the company a
few weeks ago at Ingbside. The com
pany will be divided into two platoons.
One will be known as the Reds Ad the
other as the Blues, though there will be
nothing on the uniform to distinguish
tnem. Each man will hare all the blank
cartridges his belt wiii emrrv, and it goes
without saying that there will be plenty
of noise, smoke ana a large crowd of spec
tators. If the battle gets too warm at
close quarters and there is danger of pow
der-burns on tbe faces of the opposing
troops they will be compelled to draw
back. If Captain Fiimer wants the Reas
jb draw back' he will hare a red flag wared,
and if the Blues must go back tne bine flag
will be wared. Tbe battle wiil probably
take place is a Urge field near the El
Monte Hotel. It will be the event of Fri
day. BÂ£HBoSHHQW9ttssp!'
The guardhouse had tenants last nigh;
for the first time during the encampment.
Three members of the company left camp
early last evening and drove to San Jose.
They had a time that was full of joy. ana
reappeared at Camp City Guard about 3:30
o'clock this morning. They attempted to
sneak in past the sentinels, but the picket
saw them and the clarion challenge,
"Halt! WfÂ»o comes there?" rent the early
morning air.
"Friends," responded the trio. *
"Advance, one friend, and jrive the
countersign," commanded the sentinel.
They bad been challenged â  and didn't
know the countersign. They concluded
that there was nothing else to do but to
make a dash for it and try to lose them
selves in the darkness inside the lines,
crawl into their' tents and beds and feign
sleep before the corporal of the guard
could get around in : time 'to find them.
This scheme was concocted while the trio
lay in the Dlackness under a picnic
table, the only tUing visible .to them
in camp being the guard of half
a dozen men as they lay dozing before
the blaze of the wood fire in front of the
guardhouse. So when the command for
one friend to advance came ail three
dashed for the line, but the sentinel was
wary. He dueharged nis piece into the
air and there was great commotion in
carip. Before the belated trio had gotten
feet inside the liae the corporal of the
guard and three or four relief men were at
their heels. All - three were easily cap
tured and they had to stand a good deal
of jibing all day in camp. This morning
they were put to work doing police duty â
that is, cleaning up and doing the dirty
work around the camp, and they were
kept prisoners all day, missing the picnic
at Congress Springs. "One of the prisoners
is well known in the City and has a
brother who is a prominent member of
Company B. In fact, it was , his brother
who ordered him to be punished, which is
an instance of the discipline that prevails
here when it is deemed necessary to use it.
One of the boys stopped a visitor whom he
knew as he was passing through camp
with these words:
"Oh, what if my father should see me
now! I was never cut out for a scaven
ger.' â¢ ; -: ,: â ' ' - '.; â¢ "~ â¢ â â â â¢â â  â  "-;
To-morrow the dencing pavilion will be
decorated, more electric lights put in and a
programme of specialties, including a farce
comedy by members of Company B. will
be given under the trees. , The comedy
has one act only, and it is entitled. "First
Love." The plot and the love are both
said to be thrilling. This is the cast 01
characters: Hugh Livingstone (a wealthy
iron-founder). Sergeant W. H. Sieberst;
Emily (bis daughter). Miss Emily Sieb
erst; Charles Fox (his nephew Sergeant
A. H. Clifford; Henry VanZandt Â«his
neighbor). Sergeant H. B. Sullivan; Per
kins (a groom), .Sergeant H. B. Taylor.
Favored ones who have seen tne rehearsals
say that the comedy will be funny enough
to make "the three guardsmen" in tne
guardhouse laugh.
This was a night off in camp. < There
were no exercises at the campfire, though
many visitors sat ' around it and chatted.
Even the ( 'macaroni string band was off
duty. Everybody was out in town visit
ing friends or otherwise enjoying tbem
selves.
A large party was made up and enter
tained , this evening at the El Monte by a
traveling phrenologist. He ' said Captain
t'iimer was Napoleon returned to earth;
called First Lieutenant Sturdivant Cyrus
the Great, come back once more Second
Lieutenant Ramm Xerxes on his third
trip in the fiesb, and branded Major Hos
mer's as a military head.
DICE AND HIS MESSAGE.
The Carrier Pigeon Safely Ifelivered the
Letter to -The Call."
Yesterday at daybreak the homing
pizeon "Dick" arrived at his loft a: i2r2
Jersey street, in this City, with a message
from Captain Fiimer of Company B. City
Guard, to The CjILL. The message con
veyed the compliments of the captain and
his men, and stated that the bird and his
companion were released at 4:15 p. k. on
August 13.
This is the secpnd attempt Dice has
made to carry a note from tbe militiamen,
who are in camp near LO3 Gatos, to this
City. The bird arrived all right the other
time, bat he had lost the message. The
idea is to demonstrate the feasibility of
carrier-pigeon communication in time of
war wben other means an* cat off.
It is about fifty-five miles from Los
Gatos to San Francisco, and tbe bird
woald have arrived the same evening he
was released had it not been for the fog
and head winds, which greatly retarded
him.
WAR AT SAN BERNARDINO
All About a Right of Way
Wanted by the Southern
Pacific,
Citizens Anxious for the Trains, but
Property-Owners Are Vigorous
in Opposition.
SAX BERNARDINO. Cax., Aug. 19.â
The Southern Pacific . Company has died
an application for a franchise on South Â£
street, or Colton avenue, leading south
from this cry. The petition was accom
panied by an ordinance granting the fran
cnise. When the matter came" up before
tne Board of Trustee it produced such
a Timorous opposition from residents on
each side of the street that the ordinance
did not pass it 3 first reading. The first
section of the ordinance reads as follows:
That there is hereby granted to the Sont&ero
Pacific Railroad Company anil its assigns for
the period of fifty years front and alter the
passage of (his ordinance the â¢ right to cos
struct, tain and operate asingte or doable
track steam railroad, and to operate can aad
trains tbereon and thereover by. means of
steam locomotives, for the purpose of carrying
freizht and passengers. ia tbe city of San Ber
nard! so.
Then follows the description of the rieht
of way from the junction of Mill street
and Cotton arenae to the motor depot,
and in addition the franchise gives tne
company the riÂ»ht to build switches and
such other â  as are necessary in
the operation of the road. It was found
by investigation by residents interested
tbat Id some places tne grade of the rail
road would be more than fire feet above
the official level or the street. This fact
was one of tne main causes of the active
opposition in granting tbe Iran :
abutting property-owners claiming that
tbe grade of the railroad would greatly
injure tbeir possessions. Several residents
interested addressed the board in rigorous
opposition to tbe proposed injury to the
avenue and their property.
Trustees Ham and Rstnbun are oat in
pronounced terms against the passage of
the ordinance. It requires tbe assent
of four members to pass it, and it is very
doubtful whether tbe necessary rotes can
be obtained. The right promises to grow
into one of considerable proportions and
bitterness. Alt citizens are aniloas that
the Southern Pacific shouid run regular
standard trains in and ont of this city, but
at the same time they hold that it should
buy its right of way by mutual agreement
or by condemnation proceedings ami keep
oS the public biehways.

ceived injuries from which he died an

LUST SPIKE OF
THE VALLEY ROAD.
Driven Without Ceremony
on the Outskirts of
Fresno.
ALL PROMISES ABE KEPT
Property-Owners Still Prevent
Active Operation of the
Line.
BELMOHT HOW THE TBRMUrrjS
Tracklayers Will Work Back to tkÂ«
Riyer to Complete the Bal
lasting.
FRESNO. Cai-, Aug. 19.â At ten min
utes of 6 o'clock this evening, without
ceremony, the last spike was driven by
the tracklayers on the Valley road where
the grading ends at Belmont avenue at
the northern limits of^xhe additions to the
city. The construction train ran to the
end of the rail 3, and to-day for the first
time the people of Fresno could hear tbe
whistle of a Valley road train. There was
nothing unusual about tbe driving of the
last spike, and there were none others
present besides the workmen than one or
two newspaper men. During the day,
however, % large number of people from
the city took the streetcars oat to Bel
mont and watched the track-laying. The
manner of the work was watched with in
terest, and the big locomotive with its
calliopic whittle won considerable admi
ration. The last two miles of the track
were laid to-day.
It had been expected tbat the track
layers would reach Fresno by last Satur
day evening, August IS, by which date it
was promised several months ago to have
tbe road constructed into Fresno. The
company kept good its promise, lacking
only four days. Tiiis dels* was caused by
the San Joaquin bridge, for which the
tracklayers had to wait several days.
There have been about 200 men at the
work, and they pushed matters along
rapidly. Two miies a day of tracklaying,
which was their record to-day, is not slow.
Tne railroad company has now kept
every promise it has made to tbe people
of Fresno, and if they had not been ob
structed by the Q and Diana street
property-owners it would be able to begin
shipments of this year's crops. But as
matters now stand there is no telling
when it will be able to begin operations.
It has been definitely announced that no
ess will be engaged in until tbe road
reaches the Q-street depot site in this city.
-â r ports that a temporary depot would
be established at the Belmont terminus to
engage in traffic from that point until the
difficulty with rte property -owners men
tioned is settled have been officially de
nied. For the present all work is stopped
at Belmont, and the tracklayer? will work
back to the river ballasting and finiÂ«hjng
the road.
It is expected that some of the officials
of the road will come down from Stockton
on the new trace. They will be able to
make street-car connections to the city
and will therefore be able to travel to
Fresno by rail and not on those of the
Southern Pacific, either. â¢

INDIAN JIM HASLIFS STORY.
Dime-Novel-Like Tale of a Dead-Shot
Mexican Murderer and His
Followers.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 19.â Jim Haslip,
the Indian murderer who was captured in
the foothills last Saturday by Deputy
Sheriff Beasore of Madera County, is en
joying himself at his quarters in the
county jail in this city.
Haslip was convicted of murdering an
Italian near Raymond over two years ago.
While awaiting sentence he escaped with
Jim Lawson from the frail Madera jail.
The murderej says that he did not want
to escape, but Lawson compelled him by
threats of death to leave. He is confined
in the jail of this county for safe keeping.
He denies that he murdered the Italian he
ig accused of si aying. The principal evi
dence against him was the fact that he
was found with the murdered man's rifle,
watch and knife in his possession. He ex
plains this by saying that he found them
on a trail in the mountains.
The Indian is about 20 years of age and
is a very cunning individual. He does not
possess the reputation of George Washing
ton for veracity and is now telling stories
about all the mountain criminals who are
at large to help himseif in his own case.
He has what he terms a "kick coming"
against Hi Rapelje and Constable Irvine
of Sanger. Tfie officers came upon him at
a rancheria in the mountains and he
barely managed to escape by quickly
mounting a horse and riding into the
brush. They shot at him and he thinks
they had no right to do so. Jim is of the
opinion that the law required, the officers
to call to him to stop before shooting.
Haslip tells an interesting story regard
ing the Re^an gang of outlaws, and seems
to be desirous of helping Sheriff Westfall
to round them up. He is giving the officer
information concerning them and the place
where they ars located. Westfall believes
the Indian is telling the truth in this case,
as he has other information which corrob
orates his t.ile. He says the outlaws have
a fortified camp on the San Joaquin, near
Stephenson Mountain, and that there are
five of them in the pang â Cliff and Tom
Regan, Valentine Diaa and an Indian and
a white man, whose names the prisoner
does not know. The unknown white man,
Jim says, has a bushy beard which nearly
hides his face. Haslip says that he has
been at the home of the outlaws and that
they have a commodious cabin which is
fitted up with many comforts. The house
hold enjoys it, he says, as it is both home
like and secure.
The cabin stands in the midst of a num
ber of bowlder^, and the only approach Is
by a narrow trail, about the entrance to
which rocks have been piled, with several
portholes left open. From behind these
rocKs they have full command of the
trail. Near the camp the trail becomes so
narrow that only one man at a time can
walk in it. The outlaws have taken these
precautions to be ready to resist any at
tack of the officers, and they feel very
secure in the place, beine confident that
they can kill off as many officers as the
trail can hold. The five men are expert
rifle and pistol shots, and are determined
never to submit to arrest.
Haslip visited the rendezvous a few
weeks ago. Every time its occupants
have seen him they have inquired if any
officers were in the mountains looking for
them. When the Indian saw them last
they had near the camp a drove of forty
head of cattle, which they had stolen.
The outlaws are keeping up a continual
thieving business, by means of which they
are living.
Haslio appears to have the profoundest
respect for Valentine Diaz, who is wanted
for murder in one of the coast counties.
He says that the Indians in the mountains
are all afraid of the Mexican, who is the
best pistol shot they have ever heard of.
Diaz can twirl a pistol on bis finger ana
fire it in rapid succession and hit a 50-cent
piece every time at a distance of 100 yards.
He is old and gray haired, but a "bad"
man. Haslip says.
The Mexican does not pay much
attention to the Indians, but he has a
grudge against every white man who ap
pears in his untraveled haunts. He is
afraid that white men will inform the offi
cers regarding him. The Indian says that
Diaz told him that he killed a mÂ»n in the
Coast Range Mountains because his victim
had refused to eat breaktast with him.
Haslip expressed the opinion to a Call
correspondent to-day that the officers will
eventually catch "Tom, Cliff, Valentine
and the other two men," as he familiarly
spoke of thÂ«m. He was equally confident
that the outlaws would fight to the end
before they would give up. They once in
a while make trips to the valley, and the
Indian thought they might be captured
on one of these excursions. They generally
go to Firebaugh, that being a compara
tively safe town. They do all their trav
eling on these trips by night, and always
go armed, each man carrying a rifle, six
shooter and knife.
Sheriff Westfall will in the near future
make a trip to the mountains in quest of
this gang of outiaws, who have been ter
rorizing this couniy particularly for the
past two or three years.
AN INSANE X IRE BUB.
liurncd a Barn Because He Loved Us
: ' Owner. â â  :
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. James
B. O'Rilev was placed in the care lof
Sheriff Johnson to-day on a charge of
arson, in having set fire to a large barn on
the Dixon ranch, near Elk Grove, last
Sunday night. : The man, who is evidently
demented, was a discharged employe and
is claimed â¢to have made the following
confession: ' â¢
"I love Annie Dixon who owns the
property. I have worked 1 far her for two
years and a half and prior to her mother's
death a year ago she gave me reason to
believe that she cared for me. After her
mother died and she fell heir to the
property she avoided me and would have
nothing to do with me. About two months
ago she paid me off and said she did not
want me any more, but I hung around. A
few days ago she got her brother to repair
the old barn and I heard her say that she
wished the old barn would burn down as
she would rather have the insurance
money than to spend any more in repair
ing it. Sunday morning I saw her at
church and I slipped a note to her asking
her to meet me, but she paid no attention
to it. That night I burned the barn.
Maybe it was because she wanted it
burned. I don't know, but Ido know that
I love her and maybe that was the reason.
I am guilty and I suppose I must take the
consequences."
Shortly after the fire O'Riley was sus
pected and a thorough search of the
neighborhood resulted in his capture in
the loft of a barn about a quarter of a
mile from the Dixon place.
A BACRAMEATO TOUGH.
Was a Bad Man, but Knew When He
Had Enough.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 19.âWil
liam Otto, alias "Three-fingered Jack," a
would-be desperado of this city, while en
joying a general good time at an early
hour this morning was overhauled by
Captain of Police Robert Ash and Police
man Douglas. ,
Ash laid his hand on Otto's shoulder
and informed him that he was under ar
rest. Otto immediately drew a large 45
--caliber Colts navy revolver and struck the
captain on the head, smashing his hel
met. Tne captain closed with Otto.
Douglas in attempting to disarm him re
ceived a blow over the eye from the wea
pon. Douglas immediately drew bis club
and belabored the fighter's head. This be
did so effectively that in the space of a
few minutes all his would-be badness dis
appeared and he surrendered his gun and
begged for mercy. After the City Physi
cian got through with him he was locked
up on two charges â disturbing the peace
and assault with a deadly weapon.

IAQUIS CAUSE ALARM.
All Moving Out of Thin Country for
Parts Unknown,
NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 19.â A merchant
who came in to-day from Greaterville, a
Placer mining camp between here and
Tucson, says seventy-five Yaqaiis, who
have been at the young placer mines for
two years making their wa^es, have all
gone, no one knows where. He will not
return and will move his little store, as
they kept him ud. It is now figured that
about 300 Yaquis who have been working
in this country have gone to- parts un
known. Some Mexicans view the circum
stance with alarm, as they fear all have
gone to the Yaqui country in Sonora and
may cause a big uprising.

BALANCE OF PJWER IN IDAHO.
New Clubs Are Being Formed Daily
in the Different Towns on
the Coast
, LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug.' 19.â Three
more sessions ol the Democratic Congres
sional Convention were held to-day, end
ing at 9. The one hundred and twenty
fourth ballot has been cast and no choice
has yet been made, the vote remaining
the same as yesterday and Monday, 36
to 36.
The situation was enlivened this after
noon by a proposition from the Rose men,
headed by John W. Mitchell, who made a
neat speech in behalf of "ending this boy's
play and getting together like men and
selecting a candidate who can defeat Mo
Lachlan." Mitchell was applauded vocif
erously by the lobby and galleries, but the
Patton delegates, led by Senator White,
declined the profcrred olive branch and
balloting was resumed.
After the close of the evening session a
fight took place in the hall between W. R.
Burke, a Jfatton delegate, and Council
man Tom Savage ot the Rose contingent.
Savage, it seems, was casting the vote for
a neighboring county on a call of the roll
on a motion to take a recess until 10 a. m.
to-morrow. The lie was passed over , this
matter, when Burke let go his right into
Savage's face. ; This precipitated a tre
mendous uproar and a free fight seemed
imminent. Senator White mounted a
chair and yelled for order, saying: â  "This
is outrageous and shamefully disgraceful.
If you want to fight leave the hall, every
one of you." Order was finally restored
and the delegates left. This incident has
renewed the most intense feeling between
the factions and more \ serious trouble
would % not surprise those most familiar
with this unprecedented contest.
; Mrs. L. ,G. Riddell, the organizer, who
was sent here from San Francisco, reports
that Los Angeles County is by far the best
organized county in the State. Miss Lucy
E. Anthony, niece of Miss Susan B. An
thony, has just arrived from Santa Bar
bara, where she has been resting for the
last two weeks. She says the prospect
looks very promising for the workers in,
the different precincts, and they " are all
encouraged by the manner in which they
are received when soliciting votes. : Public
opinion has changed in this respect even
during the last year. Women are con
verting many of their male relations, and
in fact all intelligent men seem at last to
view the question with unprejudiced eyes.

COURTING IDAHO POPULISTS.
Both Republican* and Democrats Seek
ing Fusion.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 19.â A special
to tbe Herald from Boise, Idaho, says:
The silver Republicans to-day left the
Democrats and devoted their entire atten
tion to the Populists. They are endeavor
ing by this means to prevent fusion of the
Democrats and Populists, hoping to then
be able to make terms with one or both of
those parties. In the Populist conven
tion to-day an effort was made to secure a
place in tbe order of business for the
nomination of United States Senator, but
it was defeated. #
This move was concerted by the silver
Republicans and middle-of-the-road Pop
ulists, who believed the nomination of
United States Senator precludes tbe possi
bility of fusion with Democrats.
The Populists to-day named Hon. J. W.
Ballantine of Belvue permanent chair
man. The committee on resolutions
unanimously agreed to report a strone
woman suffrage plank. The Democratic
resolutions wiil give recognition to the
principle of political equality, but will not
be as strong as the suffragists urge.

Kaisha Line.
SAN DIEGO, Cal, Aug.' 19.â A tele
cram was received by the Union late last
night from Chicago that the To3 r o Kisen
Kaisha steamship line would make San
Diego its American terminus. It came
from A. H. Butler, who is purchasing
agent in the United States for the OsaKa
Cotton Association. He has been with
President Asano almost constantly since
the latter's arrival in this country. An
arrangement is now complete between
the steamship line and the Santa Fe Rail
way.
The only condition is that San Diego ana
Los Angeles furnish a stipulated amount
of products from Southern California
every month. This was already assured
aiter consultations with Asano a few days
ago. Business men in both LÂ«os Angeles
and San Diego have investigated the re
quirements and possibilities of the matter
with caution and are now ready to bind
themselves. President Asano leaves Chi
cago to-day for London to place the con
tract for the new vessels. There is consid

city and part owner of the Cariboo gold
mine in Trail Creek district, B. C, was
stopped by a masked highwayman in the
mountains a few miles from the mine yes
terday, and at the point of a rifle he was
compelled to hand over a gold brick val
ued at $14,000, which he was bringing to
this city. McCanley was then ordered to
drive on to a point seven miles further
on. When McCauley reached a house he
gave the alarm. Posses are out now
searching the mountains for the highway
man, for whose capture $5000 reward is
offered.
IGNORE CONFUCIUS' LAW,
Another Outbreak of tbe Chinese
Highbinders Is Expected
Daily.
A Friend Warned to Keep Very Close
Watch by a Bo Ling Hong
Hatchetman.
Chinatown is again on the verge of an
eruption. The highbinders, as usual, are
the cause of it. This time, however, Lee
Shung, tbe Sacramento-street merchant,
is in no danger. At a meeting of the high
binders held last week it was decided that
as he had not been proved to have taken
an active part in supporting the Lee fam
ily in their recent trouble with the
Kwong Chow society, the ban of Lee Yip
Duck should be removed and $400 be a
clear loss so far as the hatchetmen are
concerned.
Sergeant Price quit his raids on the
"bad men" of the Chinese quarter some
time ago, and now the almond-eyed gen
tlemen have concluded that they will
cease their idleness and make things
merry again.
For the last two nights the Chinese po
liceman who patrols in the region of
Stockton and Sacramento streets has
been in close touch with bis blue-coated
brethren, simply because he had received
a tip that there was to be another out
break ot shooting and carnage. The men
marked for the bullet or steel are Lee Mcc
Toy, Joe Gar and any other member of
tbe Lee family known to affiliate closely
with them.
One of tbe queerest acts of a Chinese
yet recorded has occurred since the assas
sination of Lee Ti. It is the custom of
the Chinese when oneof their number dies
in a foreign land either to embalm his
body and ship it back to be interred in
Chinese soil or to bury him and after
a while to bring the bones forth from their
sepulcher and in time send them to China
to be again buried.
In the case of Lee Ti this duty devolved
upon tbe Kwong Chow Company, as Ti
was a member of that organization, but
the Chinese state that Lee Yip Duck, the
treasurer, has flatly refused to yield up
any money for that customary proceed

as proof positive that he was at least one
lof the agents in the man's death. As it is

| nese sent home in accordance with the
j time-honored custom.
I Sergeant Anderson, when asked if the
Chiziese feared that the highbinders in
, tended again to renew tueir work of
slaughter, professed entire ignorance.
"Everything is quiet in Chinatown," he
answered, "air" if there is any danger of
:an outbreak I have heard absolutely
j nothing about it."
The proscribed Chinese, however have
again shut themselves up in their homes
at night and will venture forth only in
j the daytime.
One of the most intelligent Chinese in
this City said yesterday that he liad been
warned by a friendly member of t c Bo
ijintr Hong that it is only a question of a
few days till an attempt will be made to
win some of the blooU-money offered for
the murder of some member of the Lee
family.
SHOT A YOUNG BOY.
I Policeman Mulruhey Takes a Drastic
Method to Catch a Lad.
For several nights past Officer Mulai
hey, who lives at Folsom andDore streets,
has been annoyed by persons prowling
around in his back yard. This morning
about 1 o'clock he again heard the tres
passers.
As he opened the door he heard some
one say "Lay low, Bill." and saw a boy
attempting to leave the yard. He called
upon tbe young fellow to stop, but the
j command resulted in a chase, during
| which the officer fired a bullet at the flee-
I ing boy.
The pellet went through the lad's sleeve
and grazÂ°d his right side. This caused
him to hÂ»lt and submit to arrest. It was
a narrow escape from death. He gave the
name of Edward Bond, and said he lives
at 334 Tenth street. He claimed to have
been to the theater and on his return
home sat down to rest his feet. He will
be detained until his case can be looked
into.

A Possible Explanation of
Her Confession of
Guilt.
SHE WAS DESERTED BY
DR. BROWN.
His Financial Support With
drawn From Her About a
Month Ago.
SHELVED FOR TEE NEXT FOUR
MONTHS.
The Bay Conference Will Not Take
the Matter Up Until the Regu
lar Meeting oa Dec. 8.
Mattie Overman's fran"k and full confes
sion of her improper relations with Dr.
C. O. Brown, the deposed Congregational
minister, was the talk of the entire church
world and half of that outside the sanc
tuaries yesterday, the general feeling,
particularly among Congregationalists,
being of relief that the question of Brown's
guilt or innocence had at last been settled.
Tbe general opinion seems to be that
Miss Overman is "getting even" with the
doctor because the financial support that
he accorded her up to a month ago was
withdrawn and she was left to shift for
herself. Mrs. Tunnell says that since that
time she has been on short rations.
Those who are interested in tne matter
are still bothered by two questions, one
being in regard to tne names that Miss
Overman mentions in connection with the
case, and the other where Brown got the
money to send Mattie since being de
prived of his church. It is known t;at he.
has been in straitened circumstances for
several months, and yet up to a month
ago he was making regular remittances to
his ex-charmer. Who furnished this
money?
itev. W. W. Scudder of Alameda is
authority for the statement that Miss
Overman's confession is safely put away
and will not see the light of day until De
cember 8, when the regular meeting of the
Bay Conference will be held.
"In the meantime," ne said, "the inves
tigation with a view to piacing in regular
and authentic shape all of the evidence
that will be presented at that meeting has
been left to a committee consisting of Dr.
McLean and Dr. Mooar of Oakland. Dr.
Sink of Stockton and myself.
"We will look closely into everything
connected with the case and have every
thing in readiness for the meeting of De
cember 8. Dr. Brown will be cited to de
fend himself, and if he does not do so suc
cessfully expulsion from the church will
be his portion."
Mrs.Tunnell is at present in Oakland and
tlie confession of Mattie Overman was not
a surprise to her, as she was aware that; it
was sent to Dr. McLean, although not ad
vised of its contents till after it was re
ceived.
"The real secret of the whole affair is
that Mattie is now converted and is a
good Christian girl," said Mrs. Tunnell
this afternoon. "She felt that she could
. not cany the load on her conscience any
longer, and she has just made a clean
breast of it. I did not know one-half of
what I know now. and I am surprised at
â  many of the infamous things â  done by Dr.
Brown. lam in constant communication
with Mattie, and I have also heard from
her mother. Matties mother thinks that
the matter should not have been revived,
but her child thinks differently and so
do I.
"I really cannot tell whether I met Dr.
McLean after he received the confession
or he met me. We were hunting each
other and we came together. There, have
been several conferences between- a few
of the pastors and myself, but no formal
meeting. It is the opinion of us all that
her confession shall not be made public at
this time, although personally I would be
in favor of having it made public as there
is nothing to fear.
"It is purely a matter of conscience with
the poor girl as she has no feeling of malice
toward any one. Poor Mattie is on short
rations and Brown is apparently doing
well, and it is the basest kind of < ingrati
tude on his part not to do something for
her. She is in a beautiful . frame of mind
now and wishes to live a right life, but un
til she can get something to do she must
have enough to eat and Dr. Brown should
not be so ungrateful.
\ "The matter will be again taken before
the Bay Conference, and Mattie and I will
both make affidavits; but Mattie will not
come here personatly to testify. She has
gone through enough and is now with
good friends. Mattie always manages to
make friends with the better class of peo
ple, and she has done so in Los Angeles,
and it would be a pity for her to break up
the nice connection she nas in that city.
-Â',' l now feel that it is my mission to see
that Dr. Brown is not allowed to preach.
He has found out by this time that Mattie
and I cannot be transported about like
boxes of dry goods, and Mattie has some
claim tnat should be respected. I feel the
" burden laid upon me to prevent such a
wicked man from attempting to teach
morals and religion 'to any one, and I
shall discharge my duty to the best of my
ability. Mattie shall be cared for.
"Now regarding Matties confession. It
is absolutely true. Of course, the greater
part of it has . been . known to me richt
along, but there was much that was a sur
prise to me. Confidential as Mattie and I
have always been she had not told me
everything in, her desire )to shield Dr.
Brown, but now she has omitted nothing.
I did not suggest to her to write to Dr.
McLean, but I approved of it when I knew
of her intention. Dr. Brown is guilty of
everything with which he was charged,
and he stands before me now a much
blacker man than be ever did before.
"It must not be said that Mattie is in
fluenced by spite because Dr. Brown
stopped her remittance, because such is
not true. Mattie is acting from the purest
of motives, and I know well how, the poor
child feels. Her remittances stopped
about a month before she wrote that
letter, and since that time she has been on
short rations.
"The pastors will meet again shortly,
and by tnat time Matties affidavit may
have arrived, and . steps will be taken to
permanently expel Dr. Brown."
When seen this afternoon Dr. McLean
was reading the account of the letter pub
lished in to-day's Call. He said : "lam
Very much pleased with the story as you
-- > nifwramirii i.rtT-m-iTÂ«T-r^ g^i- J ffmnirff-'Tr"mrrft i * n iilrffl-i JTgntTMmriiiÂ¥igÂ»
have published it. I was in favor of giv
ing the letter to the press, but others ob
jected, so I refrained. The letter was re
ceived by me on the 7th of the month,
having been written the day before in Los
Angeles.
"I called a meeting of the members of
the council that I could reach and laid
the matter before them. I told them that
I was in favor of giving it to the public
through the press, but that I would abide
by their decision. I then snowed them
the letter, and after some discussion they
overwnelminely voted not to let the press
know anytning about it or its contents. I
am very much surprised to know that it
has become public matter. I assure you
that the letter will not be given out for
publication, and any purported letter pub
lished will not be the Mattie Overman
letter that was sent to me."
A member of the council who had read
and reread the letter of Matties and is in
a position to speak, but preferred not to
have his name mentioned offing to Dr.
Brown's friends who insist on trying to
injure every one who believes a word of
the charges against him, had this to say
regarding the letter:
"The statements in the letter are gen
eral in character. It was a closely written
letter of ten pages of ordinary letter paper.
The general supposition that the Tunnell-
Overman letters had not been changed
but were true proves to be correct, accord
ing to Miss Overman's last letter. She
makes no mention of any time or place
where improper relations were main
tained, but is positive in the statement
that such relations existed.
"Tne letter is personal and not in any
form to be made public. There are some
things not vital and there are some state
ments in detail that would not be nice to
turn out. The terms used are very mod
est, and on the whole the face of it bears
the impression or sincerity on the part of
the writer. Of course it is not believed by
all of the late council members, but it will
be given considerable attention.
"So far as I have been able to follow
them. Mrs. Tunnell's confession and this
last letter of Matties are entirely in har
mony with each other. Mrs. Tunnell
goes more into detail on some subjects
than Miss Overman, but both cover the
same ground.
"Tne letter carries out the theory sug
gested to the minds of the minority of the
late council by the testimony then pre
sented. There is hardly a deviation from
any point in the conclusion reached by
them at that time.
"It is of some importance to know that
this letter was mailed on the 6th and
reached Oakland on the 7th. Mrs. Tun
nell's confession was published on that
day, which proves that neither had en
tered into an understanding as to what
should be said. Mrs. Tunnell told us
that she had an idea that Mattie wouid
write Dr. McLean.
"These two statements made by Mrs.
Tunnell and Miss Overman will be re
duced to affidavits and filed us a basis of a
complaint charging Rev. Charles 0. Brown
with adultery. He was simply suspended
from the ministry by the council becauso
his character was under a cloud, which he
was unable to remove to tne satisfaction
of the council. Now a charge of adultery
will be filed and he will be given an oppor
tunity to disprove it. If it stands and
he fails to disprove the char.c he will be
found guilty. The conference will then
take action by absolutely expelling him
from the ministry, which will entirely re
move bis ministerial standing. At present
it is simply in abeyance by our former ac
tion. There will be no meeting held at
the present time, but when the affidavits
are prepared and filed the conference will
take action. What may transpire at that
time is too far in the distance to think of or
talk about."
THE OPPOSITION'S COUP.
A Formal Demand on the Trustees
Will Bo Made for the Reopening
of the First Church.
A coup of ecclesiastical diplomacy is
about to be played by the "opposition"
wing of the First Congregational , Society
which seems not to nave been thought of
by the late pastor's friends. A committee
of members in good standing will wait
upon the trustees to-day and make a
formal demand that the church building
be opened for . the holding of a prayer
meeting next Wednesday night. Tnis
move, if successful, will place the opposi
tion in possession, so to speak, of the field.
The plan was arranged at a private
meeting last night. The devotional exer
cises Which 1 preceded tne business meeting
were led by the Rev. Dr. Warren, who
read that portion of the Gospel of St.
John commencing, "Let not your hearts
be troubled." In a brief, informal com
mentary he dwelt upon the necessity for
narmony and peace in the church, and
expressed a hope that it might be brought
about. . The hymn, ''Blest be the Tie That
Binds Our Hearts in Christian Love,'' was
sung, and Mrs. . Cooper made a few re
marks suggested by the evening's lesson.
Others spoke and prayed, and the gather
ing, which numbered about twenty per
sons, united in singing the hymn, "My
Faith Looks Up to Thee."
Then the business meeting commenced.
The grounds of the present controversy
between the two factions of church mem
bers were gone over, nnd many were the
plans suggested. All the proposed bits of
finesse seemed to have some drawback,
until an astute member of the conclave
said:
"We know, or ought to know, that Con
gregational law requires the church trus
tees to open the building for religious ser
vices when such opening may be formally
demanded , by three church members in'
good standing." _ ',
A momentary hush . greated these
weighty words. Here was : the long
sought lead which would force the ad
versary's hand. As this fact dawned
upon the minds of those present a mur
mur of applause made itself heard, and ;
measures were forthwith devised for car
rying the plan into effect.
Meanwhile the subscription list men
tioned in Tuesday's Call will start on its 1
rounds to-day. The document will con
sist of four or five lines, in which the
signers will promise to contribute in pew
rents or donations the amounts set oppo
site their names. Its real object will be
the ascertainment of the opposition's
numerical and financial power.
"The plan of demanding that the church ;
be opened seems to me a good one,',' ob
served one of the leading lights of \ the
opposition after the meeting had closed.
"Once intrenched in .the church, we will
be able to extend the hand of cordial invi
tation to the Sutter street people, which I
hope they will accept It is true they in
vited us to their meetings, and we did not
go; but the case, was different. We had
remained, and still remain, faithful to the
church. They ; chose to 4 stand by an un

"We could not in decency and con
science fraternize with them in their
schismatical antics; but charity com
mands us to invite them once more into
the house of the Lord, whither, let us
hope, they will repair without delay to re
pent and bewail their folly in sackcloth
and ashes/
Meanwhile the pastor's friends would
seem to have a deeper game on the tapis.
Though aware of the proposed measure,
thus far they only smile and rÂ«fuse to
show their cards.
MATTIE IS SILENT.
She Is In Los Angeles and Says She
Win Not Talk.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 19.â Miss
Mattie Overman, whose alleged intimacy
with Rev. Charles O. Brown, late pastor of
the First Congregational Church at San
Francisco, is living a quiet and retired life
at the Florence Home, corner of Santee
and Seventeenth streets, this city. This
institution is one of the many Florence
Crittenton homes in the United States
founded by Charles N. Crittenton, who is
now holding a series of union meetings in
this city.
Miss Overman has been in this home for
some time, and has taken great interest in
a relieious life. For several evenings she
has been attending the revival meetings
conducted by Evangelist Crittenton.
The institution which has been utilized
by Miss Overman for some weeks here is
practically a rescue home for wayward
girls who are supposed not to have reached
the age of discretion, and is managed by
Mrs. M. R. Hilbish. The matron is Miss
Adeline M. Lillie.
The home was visited this evening by a
Call correspondent in quest of a con
firmation of the alleged confession of
criminal intimacy with Dr. Brown, said to
have been contained in a letter of many
pages addressed to Rev. J. K. McLean of
Oakland.
Miss Overman was at the Crittenton
meeting and would not talk. In a con
versation with Miss Lillie, tbe matron, it
was learned that no one at the home
knew anything of any publication of any
al'eged letter of confession. The dispatch
purporting to contain the confession was
shown to Miss Lillie, who said it was oil
news to her.
She acknowledged, however, that Miss
Overman had often aliuded to a great sor
row that was on her mind, and Miss Lillie
conceded that the alleged confession was a
good explanation for these observations
of Miss Overman.
Miss Lillie did not deny that she knew
of the written confession to Dr. McLean,
but seemed greatly surprised that it had
been given to the press. She said Miss
Overman had turned over a new leaf, and
was going to devote herself to religion and
piety.
A second call later in the evening elicited
the response that Miss Mattie was at tbe
home, but would see no one connected
with the press, that she was sick and tired
of notoriety, and only wished to be left
alone in peace.
Miss Lillie's manner, however, left no
doubt in the correspoudent's mind that
she knew all about the confession, and
tbat it was genuine in all essential par-
I ticulars.

TIGHT MONEY
STOPS ALL WORK,
Colonel Crocker Talks of the
Present Financial
Situation.
FEELING OF INVESTORS.
American Securities Being Put
on the Market by Euro
pean Capitalists.
ITS EFFECT ON RAILROADS.
Much-Needed Extensions and Improve
ments Must Be Delayed for
the Present.
American securities of all kinds are
practically unmarketable in the great
money and financial centers of the world,
owing to the agitation in favor of the free
coinage of silver that has been in progress
in the United States for several years and
which resulted in the adoption of a free
silver platform by the Democratic Na
tional Convention and the nomination of
W. J. Bryan on that platform.
This is thÂ« sibstance of a statement
made yesterday by Colonel Charles F.
Crocker, who just returned to San Fran
cisco after a three months' absence, spent
on the Continent, in London and in New
York, partly on pleasure, partly on busi
ness.
Mr. Crocker's three children, Mary,
lempleton and Jennie, had been attend
ing scfiool in Paris in order to receive
tuition in French, and one of the objects
of the Colonel's journey was to bring
them home. Mrs. Eastman, the grand
mother of the children, who had the care
of them while they attended the Paris
school, aiso returned with Mr. Crocker.
The French course of tuition was com
pleted by the three children, and in Sep
tember, Mary, the oldest, who is 15 years
ol age, wiil go East to finish her education.
In speaking of nis trip Mr. Crockei
said:
"I went to France to get the children,
who had been in school there two yearÂ«,
and while waiting for the schools to close
1 made the tour of Northern Europe, trav
eling through Scandinavia and tbe Neth
erlands. Then I spent two weeks in Lon
don and one week in New York.
"Everywhere in this country I noticed
a general suspension of business owing to
the agitation of the silver qui-stion, and
in Europe there are no investments being
made in American securities. We cannot
sell any of our securities here, in New York,
in London or in Europe. We find evi
dences of American securities in general
being put upon the marKet and all such
investments being withdrawn from this
country.
"The indisposition of the European
capitalist to invent in any kind of securi
ties offered by Americans, or those inter
ested in American enterprises, has pre
vented tbe sale of a long line of our bond*
that would have insured the construction
of projected lines and the completion of
the coast line long a-o. But we cannot
build railroads if we do not sell bonds,
and the market will not absorb our bonds
or the bonds of any other American rail
road or enterprise. That is what forced
: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, the
Northern Pacific and the Union Pacific
j railroads into the hands of receivers.
"We cannot continue to invest money
I in the construction of new lines unless we
; sell bonds, and this uncertainty and the
probability of the interest as well as the
principal of bonds being paid in 53- cent
dollars prevents people nere and abroad
from investing in them.
"Now, I do not want to be understood as
â saying that the adoption of a silver plat
form ami the nomination of Bryan on
that platform by the Democrats Is the
cause of this timidity on the part of the
capitalists, for that would not be correct;
it is this agitation in reference to silver
j which has been gome on for several yeart,
and which has produced an uncertainty
: in the financial situation of the United
States.
"The class of people with whom we deal
in borrowing money has never thought
that the American people seriously con
templated the repudiation of contracts
payable in gold, so as to take advantage
of the difference between the value of the
i gold and the silver doilar in the market.
But they are now made to feel that this
is possible by the combination of the
Democrats and Populist parties for Bryan
THE NEW WINDOW.
and the platform on which he was nomi
nated."
"Will t'lis state of affairs also affect
street-railway extensions and improve
ments in this City?" was asked.
'â¢Why, certainly. We authorized the
issue of $18,000,000 worth of bonds on a
blanket mortgage of all the lines of the
Marset-street Railway Company. Ten
million dollars' worth of these were used
to replace the old 6 per cent bonds of the
various roads, and between $3,000,000 and
$4,000,000 were sold and the proceeds used
in the construction of new lines and the
improvement of old ones. You know, we
have recently built the Second and Bry
ant street road, the Mission-street, Fourth
street, Fillmore and Devisadero street
lines.
"We have still between $4,000,000 and
$5,000,000 worth of these bonds in the
treasury to be sold for the purpose of build
ing new lines and making further improve
ments.
"Among the things to be done are the
conversion of the Post-street cable-line and
tbe Montgomery-street horsecar line into
an electric system, and the construction
of a belt line about twenty miles loner.
This would takp in the present Haight
street line, the Park and Ocean line after
its conversion into an electric line, a new
electric line along the beach and then to a
junction with the Mission-street road, and
the Mission-street line back to the ferry.
"All our men, who have until very lately
been employed in building new street lines
and converting the old ones into electric
roads, have been laid off and will not be
put to work again until after the election.
We cannot continue to invest gold when
our earnings are to be silver at a discount
of 47 per cent.
"Now tafce the short bay shoreline be
tween here and San Bruno, which has been
in contemplation for some time. This it
an improvement which we want to under
take very much, but the present line must
continue in use until the present situation
changes.
"The interests of the people of Cali
fornia are more directly in the line of
maintaining the present financial policy
of the Government than any other State
in the Union."
TELEGRAPH RATES CUT,
The Western Union Makes Re
ductions for Its Mes
sages.
Charges Reductd From 40 to 25 Cents
in Certain Parts of California
fe-r Ten Words.
The Western Union Telegraph Com
pany has decided to reduce its rates to a
large number of points in California and
Nevada on its dispatches. This will be
pleasant news to the numerous patrons of
the Western Union Company whose busi
ness occupies the telegraph wires all the
year round. The reductions are to be gen
eral, within certain limits, and will ap
parently meet the rates now charged by
the telephone company.
In California the change will be effective
within points as *ar east as Auburn, Placer
County, north as far as Ukiah and Chico,
and Soledad on the south coast. In tne
San Jonquin Valley tha reduction will ap
ply as far south as Merced and Firebaugh
on the east and west sides respectively.
The standing rate within those points
has been reduced from 40 cents to 25 cents
for ten words. Such towns as Colusa, Col
fax Marysville and other important points
will receive the benefit of the reduction in
both directions of the telegraph service.
In Nevada the old rate of 50 cents for tpn
words nas been cut down to 40 cents, and it
w'll include Virginia City, Reno, Mound
House, Gold Hill, Franklin. Carson and
Candelana.
The reduction is to go into effect at once.
No particular reason is assigned for the
cut other than that it is the policy of the
Western Union Company to reduce rates
wherever practicable.
A NEW WINDOW.
It Can Be Cleaned on Both Sides
From Within the
Koom.
Dean & Williams, architects of this City,
Imv â¢ lately invented and patented a safety
window that appears to be far superior to
any that have been used in the building
trade. It is not only burglar-proof, dust
proof and provided with a neat screen at
tachment, but each sash swings in on
hinges clear of its frame. By this simple
arrangement the glass can be cleaned on
both sides without danger.
Nor is this the sum total of the virtues
of tbe new invention. The sashes are
hinged to a piece of wood that slides up
and down the frame. When the cleaner,
standing on the floor inside of tlie room,
finishes the lower window he pushes it up
and draws the upper one down within
reach. The lock will fasten one or both
sashes in &uch a manner that they can
not possibly v be opened from without.
The importance of a window that can be
handled from wit tin a room in buildings
that lift their succeeding stories hundreds
of feet high cannot be overestimated.
BUCKLEY'S MEN
FOR LAWMAKERS.
A Legislative Ticket Will
Be Named by This Fac
tion To-Night.
FACTIONS WILL FIGHT.
Two Complete Democratic Local
Tickets Will Be Put Forrh
in the Local Field.
THE COURTS WILL SETTLE IT.
Some Legislative Nominees Who Will
Compose the First Local Ticket
to Be Nam?d.
To-nisrht the Buckleyites will make their
nominations for the Legislature at meet
ings of the district clubs of the faction
throughout the City, and this will be the
first irrevocable move in the bitter fight
between the two wings of the local party.
When rival tickets are put up between
two political lections, compromise and
harmony are next to impossible, and these
legislative nominations which will be
made to-night will be a sort of clincher on
the promise that there is no possibility of
compromise between the factions and that
the battle will be fought with long knives
to the end.
Tbe legislative ticket of the Buckleyites
will thus within twenty- four Hours be
plumped into the local political situation
with the rival Junta legislative ticket to
follow at some time and by some process
not vet determined.
If the early bird always really got the
worm and if ihe early worm was never run
over by the milk wagon, the Buckleyites
would seem to be certain of success. They
have several conceded advantages. They
will be first in the fieid; the last mother's
son of them believes that th*- Supreme
Court will give them the party heading,
and then their political institution flour
ishes just now like a large number of
green bay trees under the kind and iiighiy
inspiring beams of Chris Buckley's con
stant presence.
The Buckieyites will name their full
municipal ticKet on September 3, and that
is only about cwo weeks off, so that things
Democratic are about to become very in
teresting.
The Buckleyites are kindly hurrying
things so that the State Supreme Court
may early end the public suspense as to
whether the local Democratic party be
longs to Chris Buckley or to the firm of
Rainey, Lanigan, McNab and Daegett.
The issue will be settled only in the courts,
and the Buckleyites will push the nasty
local mess under the noses of the Supreme
Court Justices at the earliest possible mo
ment.
On September 4 the municipal ticket
I wiil be presented to Registrar Hinton,
with some sort of a dem.-ind that he accept
it as the regular local Democratic ticket.
Mr. Hinton, being affiliated with the
Junta, will refuse, and a writ of man
damus, praying that he be directed and so
on, will be immediately asked of the Su
preme Court. The Junta, which is not
looking earnestly for any court decisions,
will be forced to oppose the prayer, and
then the case will come before the Su
preme Court on matters of law and fact,
one of which will be the issue as to whether
the turning out of the gas in Metropolitan
Hall constituted an adjournment sine die
of the old organization.
The Buckieyites, by Senator M. J. Dono
van, chairman of the executive committee,
have appointed the committee of attor
neys which will fight this political case in
the courts. These attorneys, who will
mass their Knowledge of constitutional
law, their perspicacity and so forth, are:
Peter F. Dunne, Joseph Rothschild, Henr3'
Ach, Mr. Friedenrich of Napthaly, Frie
denrich & Ackerman, Horace G. Platt,
W. P. Humphrey, Carl T. Spelling and
Lincoln E. Savage.
Gavin McNab, Max Popper, W T . P. Sulli
van and the rest of the Junta leaders
pooh-pooh at the case, but the Bucklev
ites are really exuberant in their confi
dence, and the case will be a very inter
esting one as well as an important one in
the field of political jurisprudence.
It is now generally conceded on both
sides that the court case will alone settle
the issue; that the victorious faction will
become tne local party regardless of the
attitude of the State Central Committee
and that the defeated faction will simply
have to quit and get in behind the other
one on the best patronage and other terms
that can be secured when the time for
this play gets around.
The Buckleyites will put forth their
municipal ticket on September 3, the
Junta will hold its convention within two
weeks thereafter, and the two rival local
Democratic tickets will be in the field be
fore the decision by the Supreme Court
arrives. Then the defeated faction will
become a rump independent organiza
tion, which every practical politician will
desert like certain animals do ships in the
process of sinking. That will be a very
amusing mess, and it seems now certain
to come. The way many aspirants for
office are now trying to be happy while
botn dear charmers are near is already
highly entertaining.
To-night the Buckleyites will name their
choices for eighteen Assemblymen and
five Senators, who will help make the com
ing Legislature which is to represent a
free and enlightened people in the process
of making and butchering laws for a great
commonwealth.
.Co start in with the Twenty-eighth Dis
trir.t there is not the slightest doubt that
Lawrence J. Conlan will be named for the
Assembly to-nignt. He is a personal fa
vorite of Mr. Buckley's, has no opposition
that amounts to anything, is good-look
ing, is popular with the boys of all fac
tions down in the Twenty-eighth, is ser
geant-at-arms of the executive committee,
and bis lusty presence has often at pri
mary and other elections in the Twenty
eighth preserved the political rights of the
dominant element of Democracy there.
Over in the Twenty-ninth, on the other
side of Third street, James Meazher,
Thomas Morrish and Maurice Kerwin are
aspirants. In cases like this the judgment
of Mr. Buckley and other wise and patri
otic leaders of the party as to who would
represent the party and the people with the
most ability and dignity will mainly decide
the nominations, but these decisions are
not apt to oe announced, except by the
final ballot at the club meetine, and so
prophecies are as uncertain in the Twenty
ninth as in a number of other districts
where small hordes of citizens are am
bitious to make laws for California.
The two districts just named make up
the Seventeenth Senatorial District, which
is one of the five to elect this year. Thomas
Egan of the Twenty-ninth is the conceded
winner of the nomination, though Law
rence Buckley of the Twenty-eighth has
much strength and works hard. John
RaSerty would like the nomination, too.
In the Thirtieth Bernard Conway is the
probable nominee, according to political
gossip, and in the Thirty-first Joseph
Keating appears to have the inside track.
The Thirty-first District is combined
with the Thirty-ninth as a Senatorial dis
trict and for some time D. M. Gavigan,
the secre:ary of the general committee,
has been the conceded candidate.
"Dan" Gavigan is a university gradu
ate, a young politician of experience and
is so popular and so close to the sources of
influence that nobody has actively com
peted with him for the nomination. Last
night, however, it was reported that Mr.
Gavigan had about concluded to drop out
of the race on account of an ambition for
something else. In that case Thomas
Bnrke will likely set the persimmon.
In the Thirty-second District, fl. Zim
merman, president of the district club,
and James Mooney are rivals for the As
sembly nomination.
In the Nineteenth Senatorial District,
John O'Brien, the butcher; and William
T. Bell, secretary of the executive com
mittee, are looking for the nomination.
John McCarthy, who was elected to the
Assembly two years ago from the Thirty
fifth district, wants to go back, and in the
Thirty-seventh Harry Mulcreavy, sec
retary of the club and of a Native Sona
parlor, is an aspirant.
In the Twenty-first Senatoiial District
Harry N. Kellv "and John T. O'Shea are
rivals for tne Buckley nomination.
Percy Go'dstone would like to represent
the Thirty-eighth in the Assembly, and
in the Tinrty-iunth Lee Bennett has sim
ilar aspirations. Henry M. Owens in tha
Forty-tint, ex- Assemblyman E. J. Rey
nolds and K. W. Lee in the Forty-second
and Gabriel Nathan in the Forty-fourth
are other aspirants for the Assembly.
There are others' looking for legislative
honors on the Buckley side nnd the Junta
provides almost as large a crop.
On the legislative as well as the
municipal ticket two rival sets of candi
date are promised, and what will be done
about it all depends on the future.

ness.
A Circular Letter Asking Subscrip
tions Se.it to Tho^e
Interested
The merchants of this City have decided
to make a united and aggressive move
ment to secure foreign commerce, and to
this end the great mercantile and manu
facturing 6reanizations of the City have
appointed committees and arranged fora
campaign of progress.
The following circular tells its own story.
In brief it means that the Bureau of For
eign Commerce will raise the sum of $15,
--000, to be used in exploiting new fields of
foreign commerce and meeting changed
conditions. The great cities of the East
have already moved in this direction, and
the step San Francisco ia taking has be
come an absolute necessity. The move
ment in the interest of foreign commerce
affects the whole community. Every owner
of business property is more or les3 inter
ested in the success of the new enterprise,
and it is confidently expected that these
men, as indirect beneficiaries of the en
larged trade, will join with the merchants
in subscribing to the foreign commerce
fund. The foreign commerce movement
is really a public affair:
San Francisco, August 20, 1896.
Dear Sirs: â A committee was recently named
to consider the ways and means for develop
ing the foreign commerce of San Francisco,
a:id the possibilities of this undertaking have
been considered and fully discussed at a num
ber of meetings.
It is the sense of the entire committee that
a united, earnest and aggressive effort must be
made to in'luce our foreign nei?nbors, especi
ally the countries of the Pacific Ocean, to
trade with San Francisco.
This is not a pioneer movement. On the
contrary all the leading commercial centers of
the United States have promptly responded to
tne new demands lor the new fields, and are
I already sending representatives to China, Ja
pan. Australia and Central and South
America. These commercial ernbussies have
been favorabiy received and confident reports
have been returned.
If San Francisco is to maintain its commer
cial rank and position among the ixreat cities
of the United States and meet the demands of
modern commerce, we must enlarge the boun
daries of our trade and boldly face the keen
competition in business. To accomplish these
ends Â«nd purposes financial aid, the sinews of
pommen-e as well as war, must be secured.
It ttiu been decided thnt t. fund of $15,000 be
raised. This amount must be subscribed, sub
scriptions to be paid <)i:arturly, the money to
be disbursed by the committee working under
the direction of the Chamber of Commerce,
the Board of Trade and the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association.
Representatives are to be sent from this City
to foreign ports from which, in the judgment
of the committee, the best results may be se
cured in the development and extension of
our commerce.
A representative of the committee, which
has taken the title of "Bureau of Foreign
Commerce," will wait upon you at an early
date (immediately if requested) and will ex
p am the purposes and >cope of the bureau
and ask your financial support and friendly
interest. Respectfully, etc.
The circular is signed by aIL the mem
bers of tne Bureau of Foreign Commerce.

FOR VICF-PKEÂ»IDENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EtECTION NOVKMBKR 3. 189 S.
The country has confidence in McKinley,
New York expected Bryan's oratioli to
Le dangerous and found it to be only a
bore.
About all Bryan will get out of the cam
paign is a vast amount of free advertising
as a lecturer.
If there is no sting in the tariff issue
why does Democracy dodge it as if it
were a hornet?
Business will revive with tne restoration
of the protective system that gave us good
business before.
The gold Democrats are getting vicious,
but the people will not forget that they
have cause for it.
A party that cannot organize for a cam
paign certainly cannot conduct an organ
ized Government.
Bryan is already on the defensive and
the aggressive campaign he promised has
gone a-glimmering.
Cockran's attack on Bryan was very
bitter, but then Cockran is a Democrat
and he knows the breed.
The Democrats may not listen to Tom
Watson, but the Populists will, and what
is more they will heed him.
Wo.rkingmen will remember they were
doing pretty well on the gold standard
until free trade was introduced.
The people of California are for free
silver, protection and prosperity, but not
for free silver, free trade and disaster.
Let us first open our mills to labor and
then when we open our mints to silver the
workingmen of the country can get some
of it.
The workingmen of America never felt
tne money stringency so long as there was
a protective tariff to maintain work and
wages.
It is the soldier candidate whose record
inspires the patriotic youth of the coun
try, and it is for him they will vote on
election day.
A Bryan administration, even at the
best, would be a risky experiment, but a
McKinley administration would be a cer
tainty from the start.
The reason the Democratic National
Committee is so slow about opening the
campaign is because they know there is
nothing in it for them.
Those who think Tom Waisou cannot
pull Sewall down will have a surprise
party when they see how the straight
Populists voted on election day.
It may be questioned whether Cockran
answered Bryan, but there is no dispute
about the fact that he knocked him
down and mopped the floor with him.
All Republicans should join a campaign
club so that they can take an active part
in the work of the campaign and have a
good right to rejoioa In the glory of the
victory.
Republicans will have no fighting to do
in this campaign. They can march to the
music at ease and let the gold Demo
crats fend the silver Democrats mangle one
another.
In all the Democratic camp there is not
one orator or writer to explain to work
ingmen what will be the benefit to them
of the free coinage of silver and free trade
with the world on the Democratic plan.
If you wish to know what the silver men
of this country think of Bryan's chances
of election you can find it in the fact that
no â¢peculator however bold thinks it
worth while to buy silver at present
prices.
A Republican victory will place the Gov
ernment in the bands of a well-organized
party, while a Democratic victory would
place it in the hands of wrangling factions,
whose leaders cannot agree upon a single
measure of National policy.
The Republican pledge to bring about
the free coinage of silver by international
agreement is all that the intelligent advo
cates of bimetallism ask for. They know
that Republican pledges can be counted
on and that McKinley will do all that the
platform has promised.
The rapidity with which Republican or
ganization has been carried on during the
campaign is an unmistakable proof that
the rank and file of the party have confi
dence in their leaders and will support
them with ardor in the great battle lor
sound money, protection sad prosperity.
THE WORKINGMAN'S FRIEND.
One characteristic of McKinley's rela
tions to workingmen is his thorough sym-
I ]>nthy with their work as well as with
j themselves, lie not only makes speeches
I to them during political campaigns, but
i he goes into the shops and factories, talks
with the workers as well as with the pro
prietors, and, making himself directly
acquainted with the men whom he seeks
i to benefit, learns also enough of their in
j dustry to know just how the Government
can aid it aud what legislation is required
! to advance it.
In the practice of this habit of visiting
I shops and factories McKinley has talked
I with more workingnien than any other
i statesman that ever lived in this country.
He is also in all probability more familiar
with the industries of the country tnan
any other man. As a consequence the
workinemen of all our great industries
| look upon him as their special advocate
and champion. They have conversed with
i him about the trades in which they are
â¢ engaged, and they know he is more inter-
I rsted in their wages than in their votes.
i He seeks to build up the industrial system
; of tbe United States, because by doing
i that he can add to tbe welfare of the
people and provide them not only with
homes but with the work and wages
necessary to keep the home in comfort
j and prosperity.
A clear evidence of tbe close, thorough
and mutual understanding there is be
tween McKinley and the workingmen of
the East is shown by the number of dele
gations of workingmen that call upon
him at hi-., home at Canton to pledge him
their support during the campaign. In
j his addresses to these delegations McKin
; ley speaks with the freedom of a man
talking to an audience with which he is in
full and complete sympathy. He uses
I neither the words, the tones nor the man
ners of a demagogue. He tells them of
the inseparable interests of capital and
labor and points out how essential It is to
the Nation that both should be protected
from the strain of foreign competition.
' Tlie keynote of every speech he makes is
sounded in the words, protection, patri
otism and prosperity, and the one prom
| ise he has to make to them is that if they
I will restore the Republican party to power
i that party will restore to the country the
i industry and prosperity it enjoyed before
j the days of Democratic free trade and dis
aster.
This feeling of sympathy and confidence
j which exists between McKinley and the
â  workiugnien of that section of the country
| where he is best known is firmly based
j upon a mutual esteem and respect. The
workers in the field of American industry
and the great champion of that industry
know that each is seeking no selfish pur
pose wnen they unite to re-establish the
protective system. There is as much patri
otism in a loyalty to ihe American home as
in a loyalty to the American Nation.
When the Nation %'as in danger Mc-
Kinley left his home to fight for the pres
ervation of the Union, and now in time
of peace he devotes his life work to pre
serve the American home from every as
sault that may be made upon the indus
tries that support and sustain it.
ONE OF THE FAMILY TALKS.
At a Democratic mass-meeting held in
Madison-square Garden, New York, last
Wednesday evenine, Bourke Coceran, one
of the leading Democrats of the country,
told his bearers and through them the
people of the United States that their
highest duty to the Nation at this time
was to work against and vote against the
Decocratrc candidate for President, AY. J.
Bryan. Mr. Cockran pointed out how the
election of the Democratic candidate would
be a calamity to every business interest in
this broad land, and how his elevation to
the Presidency would be a blow at Ameri
can labor. The speaker analyzed Mr.
Bryan's recent utterances and showed how
the candidate of the Democratic party
meant to drive this country into a revolu
tion and overturn and overthrow every
agency which the people employ in the
conduct of their business concerns.
Mr. Cockran himself being a dyed-in
the-wool Democrat, and in a position to
know the ins and outs and pnrpose of his
party, it will be conceded that he speaks
with an authority which is conferred by a
thorough knowledge of the aims of his
party's candidate, and that what he says
may be accepted as the truth. Had it
been a Republican who sounded this
warning note there would be a suspicion
that the danger to our institutions which
lurk in Mr. Bryan's candidacy bad been
magnified to draw votes away from him,
but the warning comes from a member of
Mr. Bryan's own political household who
sees ana knows whereof be speaks, and the
danger must be alarmingly great when
one Democrat arraigns another Democrat
before the bar of public opinion and
charges him with being a conspirator
against the well-being of his fellow-citi
zens.
In advising his fellow-Democrats to re
bel against the party's chosen leader Mr.
Cockran knows very well that he is en
compassing Mr. Bryan's defeat, but when
as intense a partisan as Bourke Cock
ran calls upon the rank and file to rise in
their might and rebuke the perfidy and
revolutionary intent of the party's leader
there must be something unusually dark
and damnable in the purpose of that
leader. No Republican asked Mr. Cock
ran to point out how Mr. Bryan's election
would be a fatal stab at labor and a death
blow to all business enterprise. He saw
the danger himself, and as between loy
alty to the party's machine and loyalty to
the Nation's institutions he does not hesi
tate to not only throw the weight of his
personal influence against the party, but
to call upon all Democrats who love their
country to dsslroy the political microbes
that have secured a footing in the party's
organization. The information that Bry
an's election would be a National calam
ity comes from members of Bryan's own
political family and hence it must be true.
ON THE DEFENSIVE.
If Bryan were a good political general
he would not have allowed himself to be
put on the defensive before a half-dozen
shots had been fired. He started out bold
and defiant enough, but for a fortnight
nearly all his speccnes have been efforts
to explain that the Chicago platform is
not hostile to the business interests of the
country. He appears to be desirous that
the country should not have any anxiety
on account of the radical departure his
declaration of principles takes from the
old beaten path.
But, unless his platform does mean dan
j ger, why should he feel called upon to as
sure the country that he would be a con
servative President ? The fact of the mat
ter is the Chicago platform means Alt
geldism, and Bryan" now sees that expla
nations and apologies are necessary to as
sure the people that he ia not nearly so
bad as the platform pictures him. He
should have so announced himself before
he started East â "to the enemy's coun
try/ as he put itâ for it will be hard for
him to make the people believe that he is
friendly to all sections of the country.
But it is too late now. He may explain
and apologize until doomsday., By his
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TMUKSDAY, AUGUST SO, 13i>6.
own utterances he has convinced the peo
ple that be is a shallow sectionalist, and
that he regards all as enemies who are not
for him. No doubt he looks upon Califor
nia a3 the "enemy's country, 4 ' and if be
cause the people of this State are not will
ing to indorse his wild and reckless theo
ries of government they are his enemies
then indeed is California the "enemy's
country." Mr. Bryan should get it out of
bis head that he is specially appointed to
rule over the United States and that who
ever is not for him is an enemy of his
conntry. _______________
THE AMERICAN FARMER.
The reasons why American farmers are
making no money are not many. In fact,
there are just two reasons. In the first
place the production of wheat in Russia,
rose from 1ti9,000,000 bushels in 1891 to
3tiG,000,000 in 1894, and wheat production
in Argentina increased in tne same period
from 32,000,000 to 80,000,C00. In the sec
ond place, in ratio to the increase in wheat
production in other countries have our
farmers met with competition in the food
markets of Europe; that is to say, Russia
and Argentina have a large surplus of
wheat every year which they throw upon
the markets of the old country, and the
cost of production being less in these
countries and the anxiety of their farmers
to mace prompt sales inducing them to
secure the preference by lowering prices,
it results in keeping values down to
their profit line, which is below what
American farmers can sell at to return a
profit.
Now, the American farmer has two rem
edies for the disadvantage under which he
labors. He can successfully compete with
Russian and Argentina farmers by con
forming to their way of living and reduc
ing the wages' of the farm labor to the
schedule of those countries. As for him
self he will have to scorn all social rela
tions; make it the duty of his life to devote
all his time between daylight and dark to
his fields; have no horses or vehicles on
the farm other than those required to till
the soil; have no clothing other than
"work clothes"; have no "day off"; have
none of the modern house conveniences;
have, in fact, nothing but a life of toil and
coarse food. That is the only way he can
successfully compete with the farmer of
Russia and Argentina in the markets of
Europe, and in this connection we desire
to remind the American farmer that he has
no market other than the European mar
ket to seek buyers for his surplus.
The other remedy the farmer has for the
disadvantages under which he labors is
to help the wage-earner establish a sys
tem of customs duties which shall increase
tbe number of home industrial plants to
the point where it will require all the sur
plus of his farm to feed the producers of
goods and wares. If he shall do that the
farmers of Russia and other countries will
not bother him in the markets of Europe,
for he will have no occasion to go abroad
to find buyers. In other words, the des
tiny 6f the American farmer is a condi
tion of degradation and poverty or of
affluence and independence. If he con
tinues in the unequal struggle to com
pete with Russia and Argentina in tbe
food markets of Europe he will drift into
conditions such as environ the farmer in
those countries. If he "'stands in" with
American labor in its effort to secure con
tinuous employment at good wages, labor
will take all the surplus products of his
farm and pay him highly remunerative
prices for them. These are the two reme
dies, and there is no half-way place be
tween them. i
FOR A MERCHANT MARINE.
One of the gieat needs of California is
lines of ocean craft sailing between San
Francisco and the coast trade centers of
all countries. Next to the kind of protec
tion that would encourage capital to un
dertake the development of the vast re
sources of the State, a merchant marine
service equal to the demands of commerce
is wanted. There is no doubt at all that
California is badly Handicapped by inad
equate ocean transportation facilities, but,
on the other hand, it would be impossible
to persuade capitalists to put lines of
ships in service unless they were assured '
of reasonable profits, bat that commerce
could not alone guarantee for many years.
The next best thing then would be for
the General Government to make It to the
interests ot capitalists to undertake the
enterprise by giving financial aid, and that
the Government will do if Major McKin
ley is elected, but that the Government
will not do if Bryan is elected; besides, if
the Nebraska man is elected there would
be no use for a merchant marine, because
China and Japan would supply our mar
kets with manufactured goods and nat
urally enough they would want to employ
ships of their own.
Concerning the question of building up
lines of American ships the Republican
platform is very clear, and the promise
there made will be carried out to the last
detail if Major McKinley is elected. The
Republican party's declaration is tins:
"We favor restoring the early American
policy of discriminating duties for the up
building of our merchant marine and the
protection of our shipping in the foreign
carrying trade, so that American ships â
the product of American labor, employed
in American shipyards, sailing under the
Stars and Stripes, and manned, officered
and owned by Americans â may retrain the
carrying of our foreign commerce."
The Democratic party is opposed to all
that sort of thing because, so iisays, it
"smacks of protection; besides, discrim
inating duties would not tuild up a mer
chant marine."
The Seaboard gives some figures on that
question which Democrats might study
with much profit to themselves. Under
the discriminating policy American ship
ping grew as follows:

No better proof than these figures is
needed to show that the Republican theory
of discriminating duties is the correct one.
Let California Republican speakers keep
the merchant marine question prom
inently before the people.
A PILLAR OF STRENGTH
Berkeley Herald.
The San Francisco Call, which has, during
its present management, made its way to the
front rank of metropolitan journalism, is do
ing very effective work seven days in the week
for the Republican cause. This excellent news
paper is a very pillar oi strength to the party,
and should have its deserved reward in the
support of every true Republican on the Pacific
Coast who is able to afford a daily or weekly
paper.
What Might Have Been.
Tulare .Register.
Had Democratic newspapers thought of it
two years ago when their party was' in full
control of the executive and legislative
branches of government they might have had
a few trusts smashed just for samplesâ but that
would have deprived them of much of their
sheet-iioii thunder this trip.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The Bayreuth performances terminated July
22, having- been entirely successful. They
commenced on the 19th with "Das Rhein
gold." A fanfare of trumpets assembles the
public in the hall with a short and incisive
blare, which forms the motive of Dormer, the
god of the elements. A second blast is
sounded intended to stimulate the laggards,
but there are none; every one is in his place
silently seated, and a little shiver, which
always precedes great expectations, runs
through the audience. It is night; the cur
tain opens, and one sees the bottom of the
Rhein, with the three nymphs swimming, and
singing their rhythmic chant. The light is
perfect, and the movements of the swimmers
managed in a ntanner to produce the most
complete illusion. The voices are- beautiful
and harmonious; the gnome, Alberich, replies
to them -with rude energy, and this is the first
scene which introduces the audience into the
middle of the mystery in which the work is
enveloped for four days. July 20, "Die Walk
ure." The scenes in this piece are perhaps the
most touching and exciting of the whole play.
They represent the loves of Siegmund and
Sieglinde, and the punishment of Brunhilde.
M. Piancon, Who Says That an American Cannot Be Taught to Sing.
July 21, "Siegfried." This Is the bit of comedy
which lightens the whole wort. It is a streak
of light across the middle of the most tragic
drama; it is, in the immense four days' sym
phony, a scherzo between the profound adagio
of the Walkure and the powerful finale, which
which is called "Goetterdaemmerung." The
free and exuberant nature of the hero gives to
the first act an extraordinary life and anima
tion. The second act is a scene of marvel
ous poetry, to which the music lends the
most subtle elements of color, and the
most varied. Occasionally the mighty figure
of Wotan, the traveler, the god, conscious of
his undoing and knowing that the end of
the gods approaches, passes with a sau and
melancholy grandeur across the scene. But
above all, in the last act, where the human
element retakes its supremacy, the music ac
quires an incredible richness and power; noth
ing could be more warm, more vibrant, more
passionate than this long duet of loveâ this
call to the light, to the joy of living, where the
most ardent melodies, with an infinite variety,
take turn and turn between the voices and the
orchestra, and achieve, in a fanfare of triumph,
a passion almost savage in its intensity. July
21, "Goetterdaemmerung." On this, the last
day, is resumed the tragic sentiment which
dominates the work, less mythical, however,
since the gods no longer appear as acting per
sons, and the principal actors of the drama be
long to an epoch less distant from our own.
already historical. The music and the dra
matic form are modified, and (he second act
approaches in many ways the usual style of
opera. There are choruses, ensembles, proces
sions, all of which have been entirely absent
on the other days. The privation was not
â¢feltâ in fact, the second act was far from leav
ing the best impressions. But the entire third
act is a sublime chef d'ceuvre, and attains at
the end to the highest summit which it has
ever been given to a human mind to reach.
First, the ravishing tableau of the daughters
of the Khein, so difl'erent from the first day
sunlight, clear, delicate and harmonious, then
Siegfried's recital, afterward his death; then
that sublime scene, the death of Brunhilde,
by which is achieved the fall of Walhalla. At
the end the music resumes, with astonishing
clearness, the whole idea of the work, the three
motifs; of the gods, of the heroes and finally
of human love, which henceforth should be
the sovereign ruler.â Le Menestrel.
The great singers, instead of accepting less
pay, have formed a ring and are demanding
higher salaries than ever. Poor Mr. Grau finds
his position anything but a bed of roses. The
Musical Courier, however, says that "sooner or
later he will be relieved from this terrible
strain. It will be the usual simple remedy
which the American people have been in the
habit of resorting to on many previous occa
sions, when National impositions succeeded in
tiring their patience. They will cease altogether
attending the opera." All Americans are ostra
cized by these foreigners, and it is impossible
for a native to get a hearing. Grau would be
williug to do everything in his power, but he
is helpless in the hands of the ring. "The
Prejudice against American artists," says the
Courier, "Is so thoroughly deep-seated that its
eradication is impossible. M. Plaiicon, one of
the ring, is of opinion that there is not one
American who can sing, or who can be taught
to sing, simply because he is an American, and
that is Pluncon's one and fundamental reason.
He believes this on the grounds of birth, cli
mate, temperament and environment. Argu
ment is useless with such people; facts are not
recognized by them."
Announcing recently the visit to Antwerp of
Li Hung . Chang,'! the Matin of Antwerp \ says
that the garrison bands were detailed to study
the i national ; Chinese | hymn. ,: Then : it adds:
."This 5 Chinese hymn ,is , not without value,
although the principal melody is repeated too
often. Our orchestras cannot always play it
as it is written, for. Chinese music allows of
quarters and "eighths of i a', tone,'; so { that not
only our brass instruments cannot play it. but
even violinists would ? : find it very hard to
render, for our ears,} insufficiently exercised;
cannot perceive such slight shades of sound."
A Brussels i paper, ; remarking lon this, says:
"This Chinese hymn, for which our poor mili
tary orchestrasâ evidently inferior to Chinese
musiciansâ cannot execute the eighth of i a
tone appears to us rather amusing." It would
be very amiable of the Matin if it would kindly
indicate the Chinese instrument which can ex
ecute the quarters and eighths of the tones in
question. .;" \; .(
July 29, M. Andre Lebon, the Colonial Min
ister, inaugurated the Exposition of Music and
t Drama at the Palais d/Industrio, mil, Ite^
Minister and his cortege approached by the
antique pathway and went first to the Pom
peiian Theater, where M. Silvain recited a com
position called "Paris-Athenes." Mile. Mo
reno of the Comedie Francaise, surrounded by
< other actresses looking very beautiful in the
costumes of the ancient flute-players, recited a
! poem entitled "LAme Antique." The cortege
then re-formed and visited the Notre Dame
Porch, and afterward went through the vari
ous sections where numberless curiosities of
musical and dramatic interest are gathered
together.
Arthur M. Abell, writing from Berlin about
the exposition of stringed instruments, says:
"I was much interested in the Egyptian band
in the special Cairo Exposition. I ivai not
aware that tbe land of the Pharaohs could
produce among its dusky inhabitants musi
cians who could play so well. I marveled all
the more at this after witnessing a perform
ance in the Arena by the Arab caravans and
listening to the hideous noises that they con
sider music Those fellows in the Khedive's
band play like real musicians, with trne in
tonation, good rhythm and intelligence. To
be sure their programmes are rather light in
character. It is universally admitted that
tnis special Cairo Exposition is far ahead of
any oriental display ever yet exhibited at any
European or American world's fair."
Mme. Duse, the Italian actress, has just been
condemned by the Milanese tribunal to the
payment of 80,000 francs. The plaintiffs were
her Impresarli, MM. Cracchi and Moreno, who
had engaged her for a dramatic tour in South
America. At the last moment Mme. Duse re
fused to set out under the pretext that "the
political horizon had become too menacing in
those countries whither they wished to take
her." The tribunal of Milan decided that the
reason Mme. Duse alleged was not â ufficient
and decided in favor of her impresarii.
In the Wilder-Wagner case, tried in Paris
July 30, the judge substitute, Seligmann, gave
his decision the next day. He first regarded
it from a moral point, and said be was sur
prised that, after all that Victor Wilder had
done for the Wagnerian cause, as well by his
articles of musical criticism as by tbe enor
mous work of translation, Mme. Wagner
snould have treated him as she had done.
But the tribunal was forced to judge from a
purely judicial point of view, and he was of
opinion thet the Wilder heirs had not the
right to prevent .Mme. Wagner representing
the works of her husband in France in any
other than the Wilder translation, no priv
ilege having been conceded. A week was
given before judgment.
A French paper, Le Temps, gives an ac
count of how, lately, Mme. Adelina Patti
promised to sing at a concert for the benefit of
the poor at Swansea, South Wales. Upon
hearing that the tickets were being sold for
10 shillings and 6 pence each, she wrote to
the promoters declining to sing at all, as she
refused to appear before an audience who had
paid less than 1 guinea each to hear her.
Tickets had been sold to the amount of 125,

years ago and every year since. ;.*:.7;v;;;i;
It was for the special* benefit of all straight
Populists that the four money planks were
placed â  before the - readers of , The 1 Call" this
morning. 1 ' trust they have cut them out of
the paper I and preserved them, for I now wish
to. show these readers the large significance of
these money planks and how far they reach
into the future. With the election of Bryan
and a Coneress oa silver issue alone the
moment that issue. became a law by enact
ment and the signature of : Mr. Bryan as Presi
dent, tne party would fall to pieces' and leave
the administration without a party to sustain
: ilâ a pitiable spectacle to gods aud men
Refer now to your money planks. Note how
small a space the silver plank occupies in the
People* : party platform. . ,It is about three
lints and y is placed "second." % The first de
mand is for "National money." ; It is to be "is
sued by the General Government only." i That
cuts off all issues by our so-called "national"
banks or any other banksâ "issuea by the Gen
eral Government only." As our private "Na
tionai" : banks.in.no , true i sense national ex
cept in v name, â  cannot issue ' gold and ; silver
coins, this '-national money 1 " demanded by i
the Populists refers to paper money, the second
Plank demanding the free and unrestrained
"coinage 1 of both silver and gold. The third
â¢plank relates to the volume lof "the circulat
ing medium." meaning gold, stiver and paper.
This is to be increased speedily to meet the de
mands ot business and population. When that
is done, the business |of the country will I not
be done on "confidence" and "credit," the
capital of bankers, as it is now; that is, so far
as there is any -business done in these dull
â  times. '.:.;. -.yi:..^.. 'â -..'. r ';;. ... -â  v, â¢ -.-s-~J '^,-.;-.
.Now let us compare the money plank of the
Silver party," supposed to be silver Republi
cans, with the Populist plan*. "We hold that
the power to control and regulate paper cur
rency is inseparable f. rom tilt jower to coi^.
money, and hence that ail currency intended
to circulate as money should be issued and its
volume controlled by the general Government
only and should be legal tender." That is the
language of the "Silver party." It is pretty
fair Populist doctrine, for it is to be issued by
the General Government only and is to be legal
tender. They call it "currency," which "circu
lates as money," and is a "legal tender." That
makes it pretty good "money," especially as it
is not issued by any private, "national" or
other kind of bank. In a word, the Silver
party declares war on the- "national banks"
just as the Populists do.
We come now to consider the position by the
"new" or Bryan Democracy on the issue of
paper money or currency. They declare that
"Congress ulone has the 'power to coin or issue
money." That is pure Populism. They quote
President Jackson and say he "declared that
this power could not be delegated to corpora
tions or individuals." That, too, is rank Pop
ulism. Tnen they proceed to say, "We there
fore denounce the issuance of notes as money
for the national banks as in derogation of the
constitution." That is a trifle mixed. The
national bank notes are not "legal tender,"
are already at a discount aud are poor
"money"; but they add, "And we demand
that all the paper money which is made legal
tender for public and private debts, or which
Is receivable for dues to the United States
shall be issued by the United States and shall
be redeemable in coin." That is decidedly
mixed and is repugnant to Populism so far as
it is "redeemable" in any other kind of
money.
Of course, it would be too much to expect
Democrats â even the "new" kindâ to make a
clear and sharp definition of a "National
money" aftet the manner of the Populists,
and hence, after declaring in plain terms that
"Congress alone has the power to coin and is
sue money," and that they "denounce the is
suance of notes as money for the national
banks as in derogation of the constitution,"
they hedge a little and try to explain what
they mean. The one point of vital importance
to Populists, however, is that they, in com
mon with Populists and the silverites, openly
declare war upon the "national banks" as
banks of issne. Thus it is seen that this tri
partite alliance of Populists, Democrats and
Bilverites is fully agreed that the gigantic cor
porations known us the "national banks,"
which, with their confederates, mean the
"money power," must cease to own and oper
ate the Government and must yield ud their
unconstitutional exercise of power to oppress
the people. Thus, also, the silver question is
but the initial step in the overthrow of the
"national bank" iniquity and the final de
struction of the predatory corporations and
trusts which now rule the country. I say,
therefore, to straight Populists that the whole
money question is necessarily and specifically
involved in the fight to elect Bryan and Wat
son. JosEru Asbury Johnson.

SONG.
The world's applause is a draught divine,
Its love is a precious prize;
But dearer than both are the vows that shine
In the deeps of my lassie's eyes â
Far dearer than all is the true-love sign
In the deeps of my lassie's eyes.
We twain stray on with but empty hands,
Yet our hearts with Joy o'erflow;
The gold that the spirit of youth demand!
Is affection's ardent glow-
On, youth, aa ever, to-day demands
But affection's fervent glow.
What matter to me that far away
Tbe wealth of tbe Indies UesT
A fig for It all ! I'll watch the play
Of the light in my lassie's eyesâ '
I'll bow my bead to the potent away
Of the love in my lassie's eyes.

THIS IS NOT A

Three Vessels to Be
Equipped Out of the
Eastern Oregon.
TWO OF THEM STEAMERS
The Hull Will Be Turned Into
a Schooner and Will Carry

FRUIT CABRIEKS QTJAERELING
Owners of Vessels That Dock at
Jackson-Street Wharf Refuse
to Hove.
The main attraction on the water front j
nowadays is the steamer Eastern Oregon.
She i* tied up at section 3 of the seawall,
and men are busily engaged in taking out
the engines and boilers. When tbis work
is accomplished the vessel will be stripped
and moved to the dry-dock, where she will
be thoroughly overhauled and turned into
a four-masted schoober.
Captain Charles Nebon, who purchased
the steamer, intends extending his con
nections. The Eastern Oregon was a twin
screw steamer, and with the machinery he
intends fitting ont two steam-schooners.
These wiii be put in the coasting trade,
and the Eastern Oregon will carry lumber
from Puset Sound ports to Australia.
The steamer was sold for $5000, but the
expense of dismantling and rebuilding
will cost considerable money. Neverthe
less when Captain Nelson has his three
vessels in running order he will be away
ahead on the deal.
The Harbor Commissioners and the
fruit men have not settled their diffi
cu.f.es. At the meeting of the board last
Tuesday it was decided to {rive the steam
ers of the California Transportation Com
pany the exclusive use of Jacfcson-street
wharf. The chief wharfinger was given
power to act, and accordingly notified the
steamer Caroline, the Napa boats Zinfan
del and Napa City and the Sacramento
Transportation Company that tney would
have to move to Pacific-street wharf. One
and ali refused to male the change, and
affairs on Jackson-street wharf are un
changed.
"I have been docking the Caroline at
Jackson-street wharf for nearly a genera- :
tion," said Captain Lesle yesterday. "My
boat has run regularly between San Quen
tin and Baden and "San Francisco, and
whenever requested I have always given
way to the river steamers. For ten years
mv ratrons have found me at the Jackson
street bulkhead and I am not going to
mate a change."
"The Napa City and Zinfandel will not
move,' : said Agent Wolf. "Our ve?sels
have been docking at Jackson-street wharf
for twenty-five years and we don't propose
moving to Pacific street jnst to please the
Sacramento River men. Let the Harbor
Commissioners provide accommodation j
for the California Transportation Company \
somewhere else; we don't propose.movmg. j
Our claim is paramount, as we have been j
in possession for years."
"Of course the opposition wants a wharf !
to itself," said Major P. J. Harney, agent
tor the Sacramento Transportation Com
pany. "It is just twenty-six years aao
to-day since we starte i running steamers
from Sacramento to San Francisco, and if
the Harbor Commissioners think we are
going to give up the docks we have been
using all those years they are very much
mistaken. We* intend remaining where
we are, and nothing but a mandate from
the Supreme Court will cause us to move.
Let the other people move if they want to.
Why, inside of a month they won't be run
ning more than a boat a day on the Sac
ramento."
Instead of the matter being amicably set
tled as was thought the Harbor Commis
sioners have the difficulty still on their
hands and the fight will be renewed
again to-day. One thing is certain, ac
cording to the fruit men, and that is that
there is no room on Jackson-street wharf
and that better facilities must be provided
at once. It was tnought that by sending
the Napa and other" steamers to Pacific
street tne difficulty could be overcome.
The owners of the -essels now refuse to
move and the iruit muddle on Jackson
street wbarf is just as near a solution as it
was ten days ago.
The American ship Santa Clara is to
load wheat for Sydney. N. S. W. Captain
Anderson has assumed command of her
and is confident that he will make a rec
ord-breaking run.
The old Sharpshooter has reached Aus
tralia after a. -mart passage, for this time
of theyear. of fifty-nine days. After being
dismantled in tae Gulf of California sne
was jid in San Francisco and re-rigged 3S a
barken tine. On leaving port her decks
began to leak, and Captain Kustel had to
put back to port. Following the sugges
tion of A. P. Lorentzon, the vessel's decks
were cemented by a relative of his, but the
new departure proved a failure, and some
of the Sharpshooter's new fittings were
rained.
After getting away the second time the
barkentine's ill luck deserted her and she
made a smart run to Sydney. The Ha
waiian Isles, which left five days before
her, has not yet been reported, so the spell
of bad luck which followed the vessel may
now be said to be broken.

â  speakers will be "Sixteen to One," "The j
' Crime of 1873," "The Republican Party on i
Silver," "Interest of California in the
[ Tariff." "The Grand Old Party," "The
' Candidates.'' There will be songs, dueta,
\ trios ana quartets, and instrumental
: music to add to the attraction of the
' meeting.
The Phoenix Club will meet to-night in ;
' Scottish Hall, on Larkin street, and will j
; be addressed by Hon. William H. Schooler.
. 3jjusic and recitations will enliven the
programme.

eloquent speech delivered by Hon. Thomas j
j Fitch at the Arizona convention for the j
selection of delegates to the Republican
National Convention at St. Louis.
"I belong to the Republican party be
cause its history is the history of the
growth, the greatness and the freedom of i
this Nation; because its purposes are
patriotic: because it is the friend of labor i
without being the foe of thrift; because it !
jis wise, because it is just, because its I
; restoration to complete power will re- I
j kindle the furnace and start the tur- j
' bines and fill the land with the music of
| contentsd and well-paid toil and put
; bread into men's mouths and hope into
j their hearts.
"I belong to the Republican party be
j cause it is the grandest political organ iza- i
tion of free men that the world has ever '
; known; because under its wise guidance '
i star after star has been added to our flag, !
j ship after ship has been added to our
; fleets, factory after factory has been added
! to our resources, millions upon millions
i have been added to our wealth, city after
city has been developed from our villages
and the land has been laced with a net
work of iron rails, and furnace fires have
I illuminated the night and the grand
diapason of labor has been made to sound
throughout the continent.
"I belong to the Republican party be
cause under its inspiration these United
States, once a wrangling and discordant â¢
commonwealth: these United States, once !
shamed with slavery and decrepit with I
the disease of secession â these United j
States huve become a country where no j
slave's presence dishonors labor, where no j
freeman's utterances are choked by the
hand of power, where no man doffs his
hat to another except through the cour
tesy of equals, wbere education is free,
where manhood is respected and where
labor is protected.
"Under the patriotic rule of the Repub
lican party these United States have be
come a Nation whose credit reigns at the
head of the world's- finances, whose flag j
floats proudly upon every sea and whose j
armies would come at the drumbeat out of j
the hives of industry to swarm in defense
of the country on every shore.
"Under the rule of the Republican party !
these United States have become the jireat- j
est, freest and most prosperous Nation un
der the lig tof the sun.
"I belong to the Republican party be
cause it gave land to the landless, because
it gave work to the industrious, because it
gave freedom to the slave, because, vhen
the Nation was in peril, it gave armies and '
treasure to her preservation.
'Forty years ago, then a lad of 18, I I
ioined the Republican ranks, and, too
young to vote, I flung my blazing banner !
aloft for Fremont. I was present as a j
newspaper reporter at the Chicago conven
tion in 1860, when ail Illinois shouted
Abraham Lincoln into the Presidency. I
heard the song of John Brown's soul I
sung in bated breath and in secret gather- !
ings of his sympathizers, and four years :
later on these distant shores I almost :
caught the echo of its refrain when armies ;
chanted it for their battle anthem. I en-'
joyed the eloquence and friendship of i
Baker and Starr King, and Butler and '
Garfield and Conkiing, and that noblest
Roman of them ail, James G. B'aine.
"Who, then, ia there in ail this land that
shall dare ask me to betray these memo- \
ries because ot the difference of opinion ;
concerning the conditions under which
silver dollars shall be coined?
"Who shall dare tell me it is my duty to
leave the path along woieh my youth and j
my manhood marched, and where, when
the evening bugle shall sound the final re- i
yeille, mv agp shall be found stiil march
ing? Rather will I turn to the Republi
can goddess the same steadfast face that I
bore when my locks, now whitening, were â 
black as the raven's wing, and say to her
as Ruth said to Naomi: 'Whither thou ,
goest 1 will go, and wnere thou lodgest I
will lodge; ttiy people shall be my people, !
and thy God my God ; where thou diest I :
will die, and there will I be buried.' "
National Republican League.
The Executive Committee of the
National Republican League neid a meet
ing last night in their new quarters on i
the first floor of the Pioneer building, 24 '
Fourth street. Tirey L. Ford wa3 in the
chair and considerable business was trans
acted.
Colonel Dibble on behalf of the Bear I
Uniformed Club offered the services of j
the club to act as escort of the National i
Republican League at all their meetings. !
This and other propositions were re- j
ferred to a committee consisting of Messr3. |
Castle, Backus and Bert.
Eugene F. Bert was appointed a com
mittee of one to have the banner of the
league stretched across Fourth street.
The following were appointed a com
mittee for the purpose of decorating the
new quarters with flags, bunting, etc.:
George Walker, D. J. Crowley and John D.
Daly.
A communication was read from Frank
R. Handley suggesting the formation of a
drill corps regiment divided into companies
and headed with a grenadier company of
forty or fifty picked men.
It was decided that the new quarters of
the club should be formally opened on
Saturday night of next week. And in
speaking of this hilarious event Chairman
Ford, who used to live in the wild moun
tains of California where they do those
things, suggested that a big punch
bowl should be procured and ap
propriately filled for the entertain
ment of the guests. When this sugges
tion was made, Harbor Commissioner
Daniel T. Cole, with an expression of
horror on his face, arose and opposed the
punchbowl proposition. People would
drink too much punch and would get
drunk, said Mr. Cole, and that would not
be desirable. It would be too expensive,
besides. It was decided to keep sober and
rule out the punch.
It was decided to bold the regular meet
ings of the club on Tuesday evenings, the
first regular meeting to take place on the
second Tuesday after tne opening, which
will be on Saturday night, August 29.
Vacancies in the list of vice-presidents
were filled as follows: %
Twenty-ninth Assembly Districtâ James
Forbes, 15 Alice street.
Thirtieth Assembly District âE. B.
GrifiÃth, 1035 Howard street. \
Thirty-first Assembly District âJ. T.
Munn, Spreckels building.
Thirty- second Assembly District â A.
Heyer, "501 Bryant street.
The executive committee will meet next
Tuesday evening. The vice-presidents
wiii also meet at the same time.
An evening newspaper contained in its
last night's issue an article to the effect
that Edward Donnelly, cattle-dealer, had
assaulted Alva Watt. Mr. Watt said last
night that no such event as that had taken
place.
The work of enrollment in the Republi
can clubs of the various Assembly districts
was continued last night,* and will be re
sumed this evening and to-morrow even
ing. There were almost as many signers
as there were at the previous night.
The Forty-First Club.
The Young Men's Republican Club of
the Forty-first District met last evening.
E. J. Wilkinson was indorsed as a can
didate for Supervisor from the Twelfth

Blackburn, president, in the chair, and 275
members â  present. Hon. John T. Dare

cal campaign. Hon. O. R. Kawag.i ad
dressed the camp, and spoke with much
ability on the tariff. Captain Leon E.

tant-General James Kip also spoke in the
same strain.

YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
Important Meeting of the Execu-
tive Committee of the League
Last Night.
A rousing meeting of the executive com
mittee oÂ£ the Young Men's Republican
League was held at 220 O'Farrell street
last night, President Frank K. Spencer in
the chair.
A communication was read from Gar
rett A. Hobart, Republican candidate for
Vice-Presideni;, urging the boys to stand
together and work for the success of the
cause of Republicanism and protection.
Supplies of campaign literature were
received from the National headquarters
in Chicago and 200 "McKiniey" buttons
from the state Central Committee for dis
tribution.
Dr. Clement, formerly chief petty officer
of the Second Division, Naval Reserve,
was elected commander of the drill corps.
Tue corps is largely composed of young
men belonging to the militia, and will
make a fine appearance.
A large number oi applications for mem
bership were considered, and out of the
number twenty-five were rejected.
It was decided to hold tbe league meet
ings in future on Wednesday evenings
instead of Thursday evenings, and the
next meeting will not take place until the
night of August 26, when a club badge,
which was adopted last night, will be dis
tributed to the members.
PRIMROSE CLUB.
A Good Meeting at Cambrian Hal!
and Stirring Speeches.
A meeting of the Primrose Republican
Club was held last evening at Cambrian
Hall, 1092 Mission street, with 125 mem
bers present. Speeches were made by
James Harrison and Patrick McLaughlin
on the issues of the day, particularly the
false one of free silver raised by the Democ
racy in their endeavor to draw the atten
tion of the voters away from the neces
sity for protection.
Patrick McLaughlin addressed the mem
bers of the club, speaking of tne evils
wrought by Democratic misrule, ani cu
ing the condition of the wool market at
the present time as" an example ot the
depreciation of the value of American
products under the Democratic regime.
Judge G. C. Groezinger was indorsed for
Police Judge and Patrick McLaughlin for
State Senator. The Primrose Republican
C:ub intend to take an active interest in
the coming campaign. The club ad
journed with three cheers for John D.
Spreckels. ______^_^^_____
CHOYNSKI AFTER CORBETT
Thinks Jim Made a Match With
Sharkey Only to Bar
Him Out
Van Buskirk Is in Need of a HÂ°avy
Man to Box With While in
Training.
Now that Choynski has managed to se
cure a fight with McAuliffe it seems that
he is yearning for yet more gladiators to
conquer. Choynski says that after his
battle with McAuliffe, on August 28, he
intends going East to challenge Corbett at
the time the iatters contest with Sharkey
is declared off, for the "Chrysantnemum"
is confident that such wiii be the case.
Moreover, Choynski says he will agree to
put Corbett out inside of eight rounds.
In fact, be believes and many of his
friends go so far as openly to avow that
the erstwhile champion signed articles of
agreement for a nnish-rignt with "Sailor
Tom" in order to prevent Choynski from
meeting him in a finish-fight.
The demand for tickets to the McAuliffe-
Choynsfci contest is very lively and when
the box sheet opens to-day the sale will
certainly be spirited. Many applications
for tickets have beep made oy women, but
their admittance will be discouraged by
the management. It was decided yester
day that Barney Farley's wish be gratified
and the fieht be for a decision.
According to the reports given by Wal
ter Watson, Van Buskirk's trainer, the
latter is rapidly acquiring lie finer scien
tific points of pugilism, but the need
of some large man to box with him ia
badly felt. Many clever men box with
him daily, but they are not of sufficient
weight to make him dnstle.
Watson will probably De in Van Bus
kirk's corner the nigbt ne meets Stelzner.
If the compliments paid bteizner by Fitz
simmons are taken into consideration he
will evidently make Van Buskirk hustle
ail he wants at least one evening.
DR. CAMPBELL'S CRUELTY
It Was Unbearable, so His Wife
Secured a Divorce From
Him.
Fifty Dollars Per Month Alimony
Was Allowed the Plaintiff
in the Case.
Jndge Daingerfield has granted a di
vorce to Mrs. Mary P. Campbell from
Dr. Joseph H. Campbell of 427 Twenty
fourth street on the ground of extreme
cruelty.
The story of the infelicity of the couple
dates back over a year. They were mar
ried on November 25, IS9O, and lived
happily together until May 20, 1895, when,
after a family jar. Mrs. Campbell says the
docror struck her with his nst. On this
occasion it is alleged that the physician so
far forgot himself as to designate his wife
as a "dirty, stinking liar."
In March, 1896, it is alleged that Mrs.
Campbell's face was bruised and rendered
black and blue by blows from her husband's
fists. On April 19 he threatened to kill her,
t is in tbe presence of a fellow practitioner.
On August 1 the final flare-up occurred,
and Mrs. Campbell packed her grip and
left her home. She did not escape un
scathed, however. Before she got out of
the house, she says, the doctor knocked her
down, twisted her ear until the torture
was almost unbearable, and wound up by
violently snatching her valise from her
hand.
Judge Daingerfield granted Mrs. Camp
bell a divorce and ordered Dr. Campbell
to pay her $50 per month alimony for the
next six months and $30 per month for
the eighteen months following.
Judge Murphy yesterday granted Elena
E. Lester * divorce from Warren G. Lester
on the ground of desertion.
Emma Pontet was freed from the bonds
of matrimony connecting her with Albert
Ponte: by Judge Troutt. Extreme cruelty
of the defendant was the cause.
Catherine Keller, wife of a Mission
blacksmith, has sued fora divorce from
John W. Keller, because of the husband's
extreme cruelty.
Kate McCaughey brought suit against"
James McCaughey for maintenance.
The Police Tribunal.
Six patrolmen appeared before the Police
Commissioners last night, and tbe result
snowed that the leniency which marked the
previous meeting was lacking. Thomas O'Con
nell of the Mission district and Charles Calla
han of the Harbor district were each fined
$100 for violating the rules of the depart
ment; Dennis Couvreen of the Harbor district
was tried $50 and Tnomas P. Gibbons of the
Southern district $20 for a similar offense.

3. No need of samples

SOCIALISTS IN
PUBLIC PROTEST.
An Enthusiastic Mass-Meet
ing Held at Metropoli
tan Temple.
ARRESTS DENOUNCED.
Audience Cheers a Declaration
in Favor of Continuing
Street Meetings.
POLICE ARE NOT TO BLAME.
They Simply Obayed the Orders of
Monopolists Opposed to Social
istic Principles.
The auditorium of Metropolitan Temple
was crowded last evening and the gallery
reasonably well filled in answer to the call
of tbe Socialist Labor party, to enter pro
test against the recent arrests of the
speakers of that party on the streets.
G. B. Benham presided and called the
meeting to order. Mr. Benham said:
"For several years the most outrageous
arrests of street speakers have been made
in this City. It is for the purpose of call
ing your attention to these outrageous ar
rests and of giving expression to our con
demnation of them and of setting up our
rights under the constitution of the United
States that we have come together here.
A few evenings ago a speaker at the cor
ner of Sixth and Folsom streets was dis
cussing before a small crowd some of the
most absorbine questions of the time. A
â policeman heard it above the swash of
steam beer and arrested the speaker.
Other men similarly engaged have been
arrested on tbe water front and others
taken from tlieir homes on Sunday morn
ing. We feel that it is time that we should
make a protest. Members of the Free
Press Defense Association and members
of the Trade and Labor Alliance, have of
fered to lend us their aid."
Miss Aspben, accompany ing herself on the
violin, sang "Tbe Song that Reached My
Heart," which was loudly encored. George
Aspben, one of the men who were ar
rested on the street for speaking, gave a
recitation from Pope's "Essay on Man.'
George Speed, one of the men under arrest,
was introduced and said: "I will not
speak to you on the legal phases of the
case, as 1 know nothing of it What I
know is that the constitution of this coun
try guarantees to every American citizen
the right of free # speech. Every other
party is granted every privilege in this re
gard. Merchants ring bells and beat pans j
to attract customers into their stores and j
there is no protest. In Rnode Island I
notice that the officials take particalar
pains to arrest the single taxers. Here
they single out the Socialists. The police
force is employed to see that the law is
observed.
"The fact is they are the first to break
the law. I wish to say as one who was
arrested that I propose to speak on the
street; it is the duty or every man to do it.
[Applause.] On that Saturday night at
Seventh and Market .-treets, when we were
getting ready to erect our platform, a
policeman came along and asked us what
we were going to do there, and before he
got his answer he said we had better move
on. I told him we were going to meet
right there. He said, 'We'll see,' and he
ran away and in a few minutes the patrol
wagon came along and hustled us to the
lockup. But we are going to speak again,
and speak again on the street. It is in
sult to injury to tell us to hire a hall. We
have no money. They won't let us work
and earn money and we can't hire a hall.
"The police are a lot of blackmailers.
At a meeting the other night a lady heard
a policeman say: 'Here comes the
bomb-throwers.' She said: 'If there are
any bombs to be thrown it is you and the
likes of you who will throv them.' No,
my friends, the public-street meetings of
the Socialist Labor party will continue."
[Applause.]
Chairman Benham next introduced G.
Haskell, the attorney who is engaged in
the defense of tlie men arrested. He said
he was not a Socialist, but was in the half
way houseâ a Populist. He declared he
was going to win this caseâ there was no
doubt cf it. He had all the law â and more
than that, tbe constitution â on hi 3 side.
He did not believe the police officers
were to be condemned individually; they
were wage-earners and brave men, ancl
were in makinz these arrests simply doing
what they were ordered to do. As for
Chief Crowley, he also, he said, was an
honest man ana a waee-earner, and in
ordering his men to make the arrests he
was simply doing what he himself had 'â¢
been ordered to do by the millionaires who ;
own the whole outfit.
The speaker read the constitution guar
anteeing free speech at all times ana
places, and forbidding forever the enact
ment of any law restraining, limiting or
abridging that right. He also read the
City ordinance touching the subject, re
quiring: men to "move on" when at any
time they obstruct traffic, "except it be a
public meeting."
The speaker said the information under
which the arrests had been made had de
clared that the gatherings which the men
were addressing were not "public meet
ings." This, he said, was too ridiculous
to dwell upon. [Laughter.] The fact is,
when the people assemble to express their
sentiments upon any subject the Market
street cars must stop and wait if they are
in the way. [Applause.] The police say
they would not interfere if the meeting's
were held at some place where it would
not interfere with other people. Well,
the police nor anybody else have to be con
sulted as to where public meetings are to
be held. If it was held in a loft, where,
possibly, it wouid not interfere, it would'
then not be a public meeting. [Laughter.]
â¢'We had to bring suit against the offi
cers," said the speaker, "because we could
not get at the real power behind them.
We will convict the policemen, and then
a"sk the Judge to fine them four bits, just
as a lesson, teaching them not to interfere
again with the peoole when gathered in
public meeting. Just watch the papers
to-aiorrow and see how we do 'em up."
[Applause.]
Chairman Benham now announced that
gtreet meetings would be continued, as
follows, "until the doctrines of the Social
ist Labor party should be adopted in the
United States or until the socialists had
all died off ":
' Monday evening, at Pine and X streets.
Tuesday evening, at Sixth and Folsom streets.
Wednesday evening, at Fourth and. Howard
streets. "

position to the'arrests were invited to be
present at the hearing in Judge Conlan's

ACKNOWLEDGED HER SHAME.
Suit for Divorce by a Husband Whoso
â Wife Boasts of Her Wrongdoing.
Three months ago Oscar F. Bernard, a
conductor of the Mission-street electric
line, tried to kill S. A. Erwin, a motor
man of the San Mateo Eiectric Railway.
He shot at Erwin ag he sat in a Mission
street restaurant, but failed to inflict a
serious vound. Bernard claimed that his
intended victim had alienated the affec
tions of his wife, who was employed as a
typewriter by tbe Revere Rubber Com
pany. Yesterday Bernard filed a suit for
divorce, aliening infidelity on the part or
Mac W. Bernard, and naming Erwin as
co-respondent.
Behind the suit there is a tale of shame
lessness that is not often evidenced by
even a thoroughly depraved woman. After
the encounter between her husband and her
companion in crime, Mrs. Bernard refused
to live with the former, although he was
willing to forgive her indiscretions. She
left her home, lost her position, and has
since written to her husband acknoffledg
iug her shame and advising him to get a
divorce.
In her letter Mrs. Bernard not only
acknowledged having been unduly inti
mate with Erwin, bnt told him of other
times and places at which she had dis
honored him, and gave him the names of
her companions.
Bernard has taken his wife's advice and
made application for a divorce.
ABOUT THE NEW CHARTER
John M. Reynolds Expresses
Himself in an Open
Letter.
It Should Not Be Accepted Simply Be
cause the City Government
Is Bad.
The following communication anent the
new charter has been submitted for pub
lication by John M. Reynolds:
Every citizen should thoughtfully consider
laws that are presented to him for acceptance
or rejection. The proposed new charter is now
one of the most important issues before the
people of this City. It should not be accepted
as a good thing simply because the City gov
ernment is not now satisfactory and it should
be rejected it it, in itself, is bad.
Frank McCoppin very recently clearly out
lined the methods adopted in medieval times
of selecting officers for towns. He said In his
speech before the Richmond District Improve
ment Club: "An accept able system of town gov
ernment was practiced in a way that we might
upon occasion imitate with profit to ourselves.
Upon an appointed day each year the electors
of towns were summoned by the tolling of
Dells to a place of meeting where they elected
their officers to serve one year. If at any time
the representatives so chosen happened to go
wrong the bell rang out again, and the recalci
trant magistrates were deposed and their suc
ceÂ«ors chosen upon the spot."
The above description oi a simple and effec
tive manner of controlling public servants ii
a vivid, exposition of what we (who oppose
the new charter) want for San Francisco. We
want a charter that will enable the people to
discharge officers who prove unworthy of the
trust imposed in them. The proposed new
charter does not give the people any right to
depose bad men who may get into office, and
the experience of all American cities demon
strates that mayors, aldermen and magistrate*
go wrong under charters similar to .he <\\p
proposed here. The public good is nmde sec
ondary to corporate greed in all our cities, and
the advocates of the new charter cannot au
thenticate their false promises of good gov
ernment from it. They give no precedents
where good"government has resulted in any
city from similar charters, while we have
quoted the highest authorities, who disprove
of the system incorporated in the proposed
charter.
Mr. Frank McCoppin quotes from Lecky's
"Democracy and Liberty": "There can be no
question that one of the most prolific sources
of official corruption and incomnetency lies in
the multiplication of elective offices."
Mr. McCoppin selected a very unfortunate
authority, since it is well known that Lecky
declares against a government of the people,
claiming that popular government is a failure,
and in support of his contention he cites the
many instances of flagrant corruption in
American cities. It is to be expected that the
conclusions of a cynic would be opposed to
the ideas of a :ree people. Such is the author
ity used to lead tee people into a scheme for
the overthrowing of their dearly bought lib
erties.
Undoubtedly the sentence quoted is partially
correct. The opponents of the proposed charter
acquiesce in the proposition of curtailing the
number of candidates for office upon the bal
lots. Most of us agree that because of this
men who are incompetent and possibly un
worthy are likely to succeed. We do not ar
gue that more men should be elected in order
to get good government, but we do insist that
ail those who are elected shall be always sub
ject to discharge oy the people when they go
wrong. The men who are elected under the
new charter can be just as corrupt us men who
are now elected, and the charter gives the peo
ple no redress.
To prove that the mayors, supervisors, etc.,
are likely to be corrupted under the new char
ter, we need not go outside of the volume
quoted (Lecky), who portrays the venality of
American officials. To prove further that th?
system found in the proposed charter is not
effective, let me quote L-slie's Weekly of July
23, 1890, which shows how similar charters
are operating. Itsays: '-It is stated by one of
our newspapers tnat in a single week recently
the trol ey cars of Brooklyn violated the city
ordinances more than 600 times. It is added
that these corporations pay no sort of atten
tion to the ordinances; â¢ â¢ â¢ and this in
fact, maybe said of similar companies in'all
our large cities. â¢ â¢ * The corporations are
coming to own most of our municipalities.
â¢ * * As a rule, no municipal administra
tion undertakes to enforce existing Jaws
against these defiant corporations."
i?o it seems the system which Mr. McCoppin
attempts to defend is discredited by the testi
mony of his own authority, who declares the
cities are corrupt, and by a conservative jour
nal which uin a position to know the condi
tion of affairs in the larger cities.
It wo'iia be difficult to bring stronger proof
in tavor of our contentipn that one of the
things needed is that the officials sha'.l truly
be made responsible to t he people ana that the
people shall have the power to depose the men
who are unsatisfactory. It Is because the pro
posed charter is based upon the contrary prin
ciple of one-man power (irresponsible as we
have now) that the charter is opposed.
We also point to private corporation?, and
contend that they show that whenever the
private corporation is dominated by one man
or a few men then the interest of the average
stockholder is unsafe. So it would be with
ban Francisco. One-man power or representa
tive power when not subject to the power oi
dismissal cannot be trusted, and It is one of
the faults of the proposed charter that it con
tains no such provisions; and it is made al
most impossible to change it by the terms of
the State constitution. John M. Reynolds
Plaint of the Shoeman.
"Talk about the street railways losing by
the advent ot the bicycle," says a shoe
salesman, "I think it is the shoe manu
facturers. Of course, there is a demand
for bicycle shoes, and that practically
opens anew market; but it must be a
limited market when it is considered that
one pair of such shoe* will outlast three
pain of ordinary foot-coverings, not be
cause the shoes are better, but because
they are not subjected to tbe scuffling
wear of the others. People ride to and
from their work all the time now where
they formerly walked, or on bud days roae
in the cars. If a person wants to co around
the corner he will gut on his wheel instead
of walking, as he once did. It is these
thousands of steps that ho ?aves that save
the shoes and make the shoenian's heart
sad.â New York Tribune."

WHAT THE MAKER SATS
Rendered Buoyant With Hydrs
gen Gas It Will Soar
Aloft.
DRIVEN WITH A PROPELLER.
Wings and a Tail Will Help to Steer
It Against Contrary Winds and
Enable It to Land Safely.
Tbe Atlantic and Pacific Aerial Naviga
tion Company has been incorporated to
navigate the air and to carry mail, freight
and passengers between San Francisco and
New York in thirty hoars.
The capital stock of the company is
fixed at $1,000,000 or $1 a share, to make it
popular- The inventor, Dr. C. A. Smith
of this City, is the president; I. J. Tru
man, vice-president; Edward Foster,
treasurer; M. A. Terry, secretary, and G.
T. Gaden. These constitute the board of
directors.
Dr. Smith stcdied the flight of seagulls
for a long time before he conceived the
idea of his machine. The motive power
will be gasoline or electricity working a
rear vertical propeller and a pair of wings.
The body of the airship will be of alumi
num and will be rendered buoyant by an
air-tight chamber of hydrogen gas. The
'machine, as the illustration shows, will
have a conical bow and a cylindrical body.
It is claimed by the inventor that tbe
ship will have a velocity of 100 miles an
hour in a calm or 40 miles against an av
erage wind. It will be anchored to the
ground, and it will be so buoyant that

when the anchor is cast off the ship will
rise. Similarly in descending, it will not
sink of its own weight, but will be driven
to the earth by tbe power of the propeller,
and can land as lightly as a feather.
The machine will be furnished with a
tail like that of a dove, which will guide
the vessel in rising and falling. It will
weigh 2000 pounds, and will carry 4000
pounds net freight.
Work will be begun at once upon tlie
construction of the new airship. It will
be built in this City.
KNIGHT TEMPLARS FEAST
California and Oakland Fraters
Help Golden Gate Confer the
Red Cross.
Prominent Officials Lend Their Pres*
rnce and Help to Make the 0c
casion a Notable One
Something that never before happened
in the history of Templar Masonry in San
Francisco took place in the asylum of
Golden Gate Commandery No. 16 on Mon
day evening.
In response to a courteous invitation of
Golden Gate Commandery the fraters of
California Commandery No. 1 and Oak
land Commandery No. 11 assembled to
the number of more than 100, and with
about twice that many Sir Kn ights belong
ing to Golden Gate Commandery partici
pated with the latter in conferring the !
order of the Red Cross on three "Zerubba
bels" who haa passed the necessary pro
bationary period as exalted Masons, which
admittei of their commencing a new pii- j
grimace into the mystic rites created from
the Christian crusaders of the time of
Constantine.
The red counoil chamber of Golden
Gate Asylum, on Sutter street, was bril
liant with emblems, banners and trap
pings appropriate to the -occasion, and
the officers and Knights were in full uni
form, adding splendor to the beautiful
surroundings.
Golden Gate Commandery opened for the
transaction of business, after which Cali
fornia and Oakland commandenes ar
rived and were welcomed with knightly
courtesy. When all were assembled Emi
nent Grand Commander Trobridge H.
Ward, accompanied by hi 3 staff, number
ing about a dozen officers in brilliant uni
forms, was received, anil in the subsequent
proceedings occupied a prominent posi
tion. The beautiful and impressive work,
which was divided into three sections, was
then commenced, the first part being as
signed to Oakland Commandery under
Eminent Edward H. Morgan. California
Commandery took up the second part and
was in charge of Eminent E. C. Martin,
while Eminent C. H. Murphy with Golden
Gate Commandery finished the work. It
was a most unusual proceeding for three
bodies to thus work at one time, but the
results proved most favorable, as the mem
bers of each commandery carefully noted
tbe work of the others, and as all were
placed on their mettle the esprit de corps
that prevailed produced a character of
work seldom seen, the ritual being letter
perfect and the efforts of all contributing
to make the ceremonies throughout dis
tinguished for the superior manner in
which they were rendered.
When the feast was announced as being
ready the Red Knights marched with
.military tread to tbe banquet hall, where,
with the courtesy that distinguishes every
true knight, the members of the Golden
liate Commandery remained standing
until every guest had been comfortably
seated, and when this was done nearly
400 knights were gathered around the
tables. During the feast, which was as
dainty as Epicurus himself could have de
sired, and which was accompanied by
generous libations of Roderer and other
vintages, addresses were made and toasts
offered and responded to in bright and
sparkling words. Eminent Commander
Murphy of Golden Gate welcomed with
warm phrases and in a knightly manner
the guests from California and Oakland
conimanderies, to which Very Eminent
Reuben H. l^loyd, deputy grand master
of the Grand Encampment of the United
States, responded, paying a high tribute
to Templar Masonry, its noble aims and
the great good it had accomplished by
I exalting the character of every true knight.
i Sir George D. Metcalf, deputy grand com
mander of California and Mayor Davie of
Oakland, Captain Martin Jones and others
followed with remarks, and it was iong
after the hour of midnight before the
banquet and toasting came to an end.
The officers of Golden Gate Com
mandery, who so lavishly entertained
their visiting fraters, are: Sir Charles
Henry Murphy, E. C. ; Sir Jonathan Morf
few Peel, G. ; Sir Charles Lewis Patton,
C. G. ; Sir Robert Ash, P. ; Sir John Gil-

Among the Local So
cieties.
REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON.
Speakers Will Tell of Their Expe

Meeting.
The United Society of Christian En
deavor, with a membership of over two
and a half millions, will hold its next
annual international convention in San
Lester B. Smith, Who Will Preside at
the Mass-Meeting.
Francisco next July. Such was tbe news
which tbe delegates to the International
Christian Endeavor Convention held at
Washington, D. C, last month, brought
back to the Golden Gate Union of Chris
tian Endeavor.
The Endeavorers of San Francisco and
Oakland held one mass-meeting to cele
brate the bringing of tne great convention
West on August 6, in the Central M. E.
Church, and the enthusiasm which was
manifest there gave full evidence of tbe
intense interest which the Endeavorers
have in the coming convention.
As all the delegates attending the Wash
ington convention have bow returned,
arrangements have been made to hold a
stiSl larger mas s-meeting to accommodate
the hundreds who were unable to attend
the previous one and to give the Endeavor
ers a chance to hear reports from the dele*
j gates who have since returned.
Great preparations are being made by
Lester B. Smith, the chairman of the
mass-meeting, to have this the largest and
best meeting which the Endeavorers have
held.
The mass-meeting will be held at Ply
mouth Congregational Church to-morrow
evening at 7:45 o'clock and will be under
the auspices of the Young People's So
ciety of Plymouth Church. One of the
special features of the evening will be an
address on "San Francisco, '97," by J. 8.
Webster, vice-chairman of the conven
tion committee of '97. Mr. Webster will
tell what will have to be done in the wav
of preparing for this convention and what
the convention will do for the City.
Rev. William Rader, pastor of the Third
Congregational Church, will give a bright
address on the Washington convention
under the title of "Washington Sparks."
Rolla V. Watt, the chairman of the '97
convention committee, to whom much of
the credit is due for bringing the conven
tion \vest. will tell briefly how the Wash
ington convention committee took care of
the vast numbers who attended and how
San Francisco won the convention. An
other report of the Washington conven
tion will be given under the title of
"Washington Impressions." Dr. E. E.
Kelly, who will deliver the latter address,
is an ex-president of the California En
deavor Union, and has done much toward
raising the funds for the coming conven
tion.
The mass-meeting will close with a con
secration address by tbe Rev. W. D. Wil
liams, D.D., pastor of Plymouth Congre
gational Church.
The Christian Endeavorers both in Oak
land and Ban Francisco are fully alive to
the work which is before them in the way
of preparing for the convention. The
Golden Gate Union of Christian Kndeavor
has pledged $.5000 of the $25,000 guarantee
which was necessary in order to bring the
convention out here. Each society in the
union has been assessed its share of the
$5000, and already many of the societies
have paid to Charles Whitney, tbe treas
urer of the union, large portions of their
pledges.
T lie Oakland Endeavorers have promised
to raise $4000 for the convention, $1500 of
which will be kept to be used as a special
fund for an Oakland day in the convention.

BALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 18.â A special
to tbe Herald from Boise, Idaho, tays:
To-night there is weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth in the ranks of the silver
Republicans. It was caused by the action
of the Democratic convention, by a vote of
108 to 31, instructing the conference com
mittee on fusion to deal exclusively with
the Populists. This shuts Dubois and his
following of Republican bolters out. Tbe
conference committee will meet in the

LOCATED ON THE FRONT
Many Eastern Capitalists Are
Interested in the
Scheme.
THE CARNIVAL IS BOOMING.
Votin? Contest Goes on Merrily With
Miss Amjornson in the
Lead.
A big scheme Is rumored about the water
front of Sausalito. Lieutenant-Colonel
William St. Paul Seitz, the former lessee
of the Sausalito Hotel, is in the East inter
esting Eastern capitalists in building an
immense floating bathhouse in front of
Sausalito. Colonel Seitz is forming a stock
company of Eastern capitalists. This
proposition has been in quiet agitation for
over a year. It is now coming to a head.
Colonel Seitz will return to Sausalito in a
few weeks.
The plans have already been drawn up.
The floating bathing resort will consist of
hot and cold water baths, a restaurant and
theater combined, making Sausalito the
pleasure resort par excellence of the Pacific
Coast.
The plans have already been drawn up
and are in the possession of Lieutenant-
Colonel Seitz.
It is stated that everything will be on a
grand scale and be superior to anything on
this coast. The building already planned
wiil be flanked by four high towers and the
architecture willbe the modern Gothic.
Lieutenant- Colonel Seitz, who will
return in a few weeks, was last year tbe
lessee of the Sausalito Hotel. He held an
important position in the last Miawinter
Fair, and from there went to Montreal,
Canada, where be held a like responsible
position in an exposition in that city.
From that city he' went on to Eastern
cities and has got Eastern capitalists in
terested in the construction of an elabor
ate bathhouse near Sausalito.
The location of the floating bathhouse is
stated as being between the Pacific and
San Francisco Yacut clubhouses on the
Sausalito Bay Land Company's property.
For three weeks tbe Sausalito Electric
Light Company, under the proprietorship
of T. J. Frost and Tom Scully, has been in
full blast. Fifty houses on the hill are
illuminated by incandescent lamps. The
company is stretching wires as rapidly as
possible.
It is proposed to have during the carni
val the legend "Sausalito" suspended near
the depot composed of at least 250 electric
lights.
The plant has been adjudged as the
most complete on the Pacific Coast for it*
sizs. Enough power is generated there to
supply all the house and street illumina
tion of Sausalito.
Fifty houses on the hill are already il
luminated by incandescent lights, and
orders are out for 100 more.
The dynamo was got from the Fort
Wayne Electric Light Company and the
power engine from A. L. Fish & Co. This
is an 85 horse-power engine.
It is expected that at least fifty lights
will be erected for the illumination of the
streets of Sausalito on the hill and down
on the front.
When this is accomplished Sausalito
will be visible like a brilliant constellation
of u tars from all the bay cities.
Tbe carnival preparations are progress
ing rapidly and successfully. Nothing
definite will be determined, however, be
fore the meeting on next Monday night,
when the committees will report.
General Dickinson states that there is
j much money in sL-ht â enough to make
the carnival au assured thing.
Commodore Bruce says that every thine
on tbe bay at the festivity will be splen
didly illuminated. Nothing, however,
will be definitely decided until the meet
ing on Monday night.
The votine for the carnival queen is go
ing on merrily. The record stands as fol
lows: Miss L.- Amjornson 129, Miss K.
Becker 125, Miss R. Miller 89, Miss Licht
enstein 80, Miss K. Forman 57.
Yesterday afternoon it was doubtful if
anything would transpire at the trial of
1 William Cohen, arrested as being a seller
of pools under the management of Har
rison & Co.
Commission Broker or Pooiseller Har
rison said yesterday: "1 am not a pool
seller; I am a commission broker. My
fight will be on these grounds. I receive
a 5 per cent commission from every buyer,
and a commission from the Bookmakers'
Club of New York. Ido not run a pool
room â simply a commission house, and I
am licensed as such. The money made
here does not remain with me, but goes to
the East to the parties who employ me. I
am the ffrst man to run an establishment
of this kind on the Pacific Coast, and 1 do
not come under the poolroom law. I run
a legitimate poolroom business."
The case against William Cohen will be
prosecuted by A. Silva, prosecuting at
torney, and the defense wiil be represented
by James W. Cochran, ex-District Attor
ney of Marin County.
A. Silva said: "1 shall try this case
under Penal Code section 32, making it
utterly Immaterial whether a person is
agent or proprietor of a poolroom, so long
as he sells pools on a race or aids or abets
a hazard on an event."
Judge Pottrell of Mill Valley will try
the case in question.
The case is designated as "People versus
W. Cohen," and was instigated on a ticket
bought by Marshal Creed.
Marshal Creed says be bought the ticket
for $1 10 and lost on the proposition. This
was about tbe Ist of July.
Monday the trustees passed an ordinance
forbidding the purchasing of pools. "The
trustees have put too much upon me,"
said Marshal Creed. "It is a very difficult
matter to decide who are poolsellers and
who are simply visitors. Consequently I
have made no arrests. I notified all pool
buvers that if they continued to buy I
would arrest them thirty minutes after
notification. But I was unable to find any
who bought after my warning.
In the meantime Harrison's poolroom
or commission-house goes on at full blast
and unmolested. Harrison says if de
feated in the courts at Sausalito he will
immediately appeal to the Supreme Court
and there is sure of victory.
"I shall continue to run here," said he
' as long as I wish-as long, in fact, as I can
make money. I know it, because I have
the law on my side. lam not a poolroom
man, simply n commission broker "
DID NOT HEAL THE BREACH.

the breach between the two wings of the
Prohibitionists by nominating the Prohi

The tight between the two factions of
the party came up over the nomination
of a candidate for Congressman at large.
The fusionists wanted Rev. J. D. Botkin,
the nominee of the Populists and Demo
crats, and he was nominated by a vote of
21 to 19. The middle-of-the-road men
then said that if Bryan electors were nom
inated they would bolt the convention
and have nothing more to do with the
party. To prevent this, the Bryan men,
who apparently were in the majority,
made no opposition to the nomination of
Bentley electors, but declared openly that
they would vote for Bryan and Sewall.

11 Pounds in 28 Days.
< ANGELS CAMP, August 7, 18!)Â«;.
Dr. A. T. Sandenâ Dear Sir : It is over a month
since I commenced to wear your Belt, and it has
made a great change in my condition. 1 have
gained eleven pounds in twenty-eight days.
When I started to wear your belt I was so run
down that I had to give up work. The belt
stopped the weakness in four days, and I
have had none since. I took up my duty at the
engine after wearing the belt a week and have
not lost an hour since. My father has been
wearing the belt from three to four hours a
day, and !is now able to put bis hands above
his head, something he has not been able to do
for fony-five years, and he never tires of tell-
ing the people of the good the belt has done
for him. As for me, I would not take all the
gold in the country for my belt and go back to
the condition I was in two months ago, If I
could not get another one like it. I cannot
speak too highly of your belt and the good it
has done me. 1 remain yours gratefully.

No man can attain physical or muscular
perfection while there is any want of vital
force. It is the grit, the vim, the "ginger"
which supports the powers of endurance,
and the . command of latent physical
Strength. ; '.â !'.'.'.
' Every man knows himself. He knows,
where he is weak. Knowing it, if he is
true to himself, he will try to recover the
vital power he has wasted. â .'.
The source of all t physical power is in
the nerves. The life of the nerves is elec-
tricity. So says science. Man, if you lack
any of the elements of manhood, will you
barter your future happiness any further

new life to the nerves, and from them to
the whole body. The brain will be re-
freshed, the nerves strong quick and ac-

expand and develop in force and vitality.
It will, In . three ' months, renew perfect

KARE BEAUTY OF THE BRIDE.
Six Bridesmaids in Dainty Green and
White Attend the Bride to
the Altar.

H was then sne met the fortunate man
whose wife she became yesterday.
The announcement of the engagement
was rather a shock to the Oakland beaux.
Miss Ralston's rare beauty and charms

hosts of friends, and her admirers were
many.
San Francisco society, as well as the best
of Oakland, was weil represented at the

little flower girls, Carmeiita Selby and
Taxito Atherton, who in turn preceded
the bride, who entered leaning on the arm
of her fattier.
Dr. Bullitt and his best man, Louis Ral
ston, met the bride at the altar, where
Bishop Nichols, assisted by Dr. Ritchie of
St. Paul's, read the impressive and simple
Episcopal service.
The bride wore an elegant gown of
cream white satin, made exquisitely sim
ple. The corsage was trimmed with rare
old lace, and the demi-train jupo per
fectly plain. The bndai veil was fastened
to the coiffure with a wreath of orange
blossoms.
The bridesmaid and maid of honor were
Miss Claire Ralston.

EDITORIAL AMENITIES .
The Supreme Court Has a Chance to
See How Country Newspaper Men
I-otc Cne Another.
L. R. Leonard, a former resident of Hol
lister, and for some time business man
ager of a newspaper in that town, got into
trouble with A. D. Shaw and George E.
Shaw, editors and publishers of the San
Benito Advance. The little misunder
standing resulted in the publication of the
following article in the Advance of January
12, 1894:
"GONE TO FKEBH PASTURES."
L. R. Leonard, the erstwhile manager of an
industrial publishing company that never had
a legal existence, has gone where the wood
bine twineth, and the Nash Brothers, who in
dulged in the luxury of running a newspaper
to vary the monotony of farm life, mourn as
tbe whangdoodle over its first-born. As man
ager of the semi-weekly Wet Hen, Leonard
made the ghost walk longer than any of the
journalistic pirates who ever located in Hol
lister, and he left a deeper hole in the pockets
oi his backers. Leonard hart been getting
ready to skip for some time past, but he staved
just long enough to gel a hide-bound Board of
Supervisors to fix county printing rates ac
cording to his starvation schedule, and then
skipped off to pastures new in search of
another batch of suckers.
In the Superior Court of Pan Benito
County, Leonard sued for $5000 damages
for libel, which amount he did not get.
-He then appealed to the Supreme Court,
but with no better success, the court deny
ing the petition for a new trial on the
ground that no specifications of error ap
peared.
SAILORS' HOME AFFAIRS,
The Annual Meeting of the
Ladies' Seamen's Friend
Society.
Reports of the Secretary acd Treas
urerâElection of New
Officers.
The Ladies Seamen's Friend Society
held its fortieth annual meeting at the
Sailor's Home yesterday afternoon with
Mrs. W. B. Ewer, the president, in the
chair. There were present: Mrs. S. B.
Cooper, Mrs. A. McAnney, Mrs. W. H.

Pierre, Mrs. H. R. Boyntcn, Mrs. Paris
Kilburn, Mrs. E. S. BaVcley, Mrs. A. C.
Wright, Mrs. M. E. Leilich, Mrs. A. L.
Brannan.
The report of the secretary, Airs. A. Mc-
Anney, for the year ending August 1, 1896,
was devoted to tne work of the society
among the seamen of this port and to the
management of the Home. The building
being so old repairs have been made to the
extent of about $2000, which includes a
new range in the kitchen at a cost of
$1400, a new roof and plumbing and car
penter work in the rooms.

Superintendent Staples retains all the
receipts of the home less 5 per cent, with
which the society keeps the building in
repairs. As a large number of the in
mates are sailors unable to set a ship and
other seamen sick and destitute, sent to
their homes and to snug harbors at the
society's expense, there is little surplus
left at the end of the year either to the
superintendent or society.
The superintendent makes his annual
report as follows : .
To the Board of Managersâ lndies: When I
made my ; report for the year 1895 I was in
hopes, by â¢ the appearance of things, that we
should be able to do more business, but ship
ping has not improved and consequently the
amount of business done by the Home has not
exceeded last year's work. , . .
We expected much from coasting ships, but
on account of foreign tramp steamers coming
here and monopolizing ! most of the coal car
rying trade from British Columbia, which was
formerly done by our coasting ! ships, many of
which were forced to seek off-shore charters,
therefore a large number of coasting sailors
have been thrown out of employment. â 
Deep-water , shipping has been very dull
during the year, most of the men shipping in
English ships.
Seamen's wages have been from $17 50 to
$20 ncr month on deep-water ships, coasting
wages from $25 to $30 per month.
There has been no complaint from sailors as
to their treatment. They seem to understand
that the ladies are doing all in their power for
their comfort.

GOODWIN WANTS A DIVORCE.
The Weil-Known Comedian Says His
Wife I<t Habitually Intemperate.
The fact that the well-known comedian
Nat C. Goodwin is suing for a divorce
came to light yesterday. The suit was
filed in this City on July 13, but, owing to
the efforts made to keep the matter quiet,
very few persons knew of it until the sum
mons was published.
Mr. Goodwin claims to have been a resi
dent of California for over a year preced
ing tbe filing of the suit, and asks for a
divorce from NelJa R. Goodwin because of
her alleged habitual intemperance.
Tbe Goodwins were married in Chicago
in October, 1888. Mrs. Goodwin being a
Miss Baker. In 1891 she secured a separa
tion from the comedian, and until now
most people who knew the pair thought
them divorced. Their domestic infelici
ties before the separation had for some
time been matter of public comment.
Goodwin is now in Australia and hia
wife in New York. While here on his last
visit the former was very attentive to Miss
Alaxine Elliott, then of the Frawiey Com
pany, who has since joined the Goodwin
Company in tbe Antipodes. Rumor says
that it is Goodwin's desire to marry again
and that Miss Elliott is tbe lady of his
choice.
AN ENEMY OF CORPULENCE.

Remedy "Sanicult. "
Professor William Manning is in the
fiela with a new remedy for corpulence.
He claims it will take the fat off the bones
of any man, if it be used properly, and is
an excellent thing for athletes to train on
and to bring pugilists down to weieht.
A dose in the morning and a few moments
witb the dum-bells is all that is necessary,
and he says tbat in a week a man can
bring himself down more than in a month
of steady training. He calls his new rem
edy "Sanicult" ana he intends soon to put
it on the market. . ]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 1896.
EULOGY ON
AUGUST HELBING
Funeral Services in the
Temple Emanu-El
Yesterday.
A LARGE ATTENDANCE.
His Career Was a Very In
spiriting Example to the
Young.
SERMON BY DR. VOORSAMGER.
Words of Appreciation for the
Founder of the Eureka Benev
o'ent Association.
The funeral of August Helbing took
place at the Temple Emanu-El yesterday.
There was present a large assemblage of
friends of the old pioneer merchant,
AUGUST HELBING, WHOSE FUNERAL TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY.
among them being some who had known
him when he came to California in 1850
from New Orleans and when he estab
lished the dry-goods house of Meyer,
Helbing & Co., and subsequently when
he was the leading partner in Helbing,
Strauss & Co. There were many middle
aged people present. Rev. Dr. Voor
sanger in his sermon spoke of the ripe
age which Mr. Helbing reached â 73 years
â and alluded to his birth in Munich, to
his coming to the United States with the
late Moritz Meyer as the result of the
political agitation in Germany in 1844, and
dwelt on the fact that he was the founder
of tbe Eureka Benevolent Association, of
which he was the first president Rev.
Dr. Voorsanger also spoke of August
Helbing's father, who was court jeweler
toLudwig I, King of Bavaria, and also of
his mother.
Most of the leading points in Mr. Hel
bing's biography were mentioned. He
reached New York in 1844, and a year later
went to New Orleans wilh Moritz Meyer,
where, a year later, they were joined by
Auenst Wtreserman. They engaged in
business in New Orleans, and continued
tnere until the discovery of gold in Cali
fornia became known. Mr. Helbing in
1858 married Miss Francisca Koenigaberger,
a niece of Cantor Sulzer of Vienna, He
met with financial reverses in the mining
stock business after he had retired from
the firm of Helbing, Btrauss & Co. He
was president of the People's Institute
wnich preceded the Mechanics' Institute.
In many directions he was active and
useful. Four children survive him, David
A., Carrie, Lillie and Jacob A. Helbing.
"Hia was a life," said Rev. Dr. voor
sanger, opening the funer. ' sermon, "to
serve as a lesson to fit into the lives of
others. He was opposed to ostentation.
He was, so far as I Knew him, a man of
eminently retiring disposition, and his
chiet joy was in his home wbich his
character and love had made so beautiful.
He would have taught that the ostenta
tion and extravagance which so often
mark the last services for the dead
would be better replaced by gold pieces
for the poor. The true offerings of the
living to the dead are not floral pieces but
tears.
"It would not be proper for me to stand
here to-day, in view of his character,
merely to speak words of eulogy over a
friend without enforcing the lesson of his
life. He was one of the gifted of God;
one whose greatest endowment was his
character, which we have so much ad
mired. He came from the country which
has given the United States so much of
good, and one of the most important at
tributes of that people is obedience to the
law. He was reared in a land where his
surroundings gave him a high conception
of duty. His lather was the favored com
panion of princes. His mother possessed
a high character, and one of the lessons
she taught him was liberty, that lesson
wbich has always been in the hearts of
Israelites.
"That spirit of liberty abided in Prussia
during the iateful days when August
Helbing was a young man, and with that
spirit in him he came to America. When
a new commonwealth was created of Cali
fornia he became a great man, for the
goodness of his character was better thaD
the shrewdness of the mind which enabled
others to amass money. He saw the
necessity for a good government for the
commonwealth, and be did good work.
He took from the incoming ships bring
ing emigrants the sijfc and the poor to
his own room and to the rooms of his
friends and cared for them, exemplifying
the highest form of religion. This is a
historical day, for it marks the passing
away of one who was the founder of one
of the most remarkable societies
ever organized in the United States,
the Eureka Benevolent Association, which
starting with a membership of thirteen in
a Kearny-street room in the 50's has now
1000 members, with funds amounting to
$200,000 and witb an expenditure of from
$20,000 to $25,000 per' annum. No one
could fail to Bee that his life taught ihe
lesson of religion and patriotism. He
was an nrdent American.
"Was there a man acquainted with him
who when the terrible misfortune iell
upon him could have stood as firmly as he
did? He in the sanctity of his home
spoke no word of discontent. He was
noted for integrity, probity and patriot
ism. Here was one of whom nature could
say, 'He was a man.' " Rev. Dr. Voor
sanger spoke at length.
After the sermon those present passed
in front of the casket, be stowing a last
glance. The pallbearers, who represented
the Eureka Benevolent Association, Pa
cific Lodge, F. <fc A. M., the San Francisco
Stock and Bond Exchange and the friends
of the family, were: S. W. Rosenstock,
Aaron Conn, John Perry Jr., R. G. Brown,
Louis Gerstle, Philip Lilienthal, M. H.
Hecht. A. Godchaux, Ben Schloss, Mat
thias Meyer, J. Greenebaum, S. Koshland,
A. Wolf, L. Dinkelspiel, P. Berwin, L.
Meyerstein and A. Anspacher. The in
terment was at the Home of Peace Ceme
tery in San Mateo County.
BURGLARY IN A CAMP.
John McGinniss, a Laborer, Caught
Stealing Sacks of Barley Early in
the Morning.
John McGinniss, a laborer, was arrested
early yesterday morning by Policeman
Durkin and booked at the City Prison on
the charge of burglary.
Sacks of barley and oats had been stolen
from Tuttle's camp on Seventh avenue
and B street, and the men decided to fceep
a lookout for the thief. About 2 o'clock
yesterday morning McGinniss was ob
served to walk stealthily to where the
grain was stored. He lifted up a sack of
barley and carried it to a bugt;y he had in
waiting. He was returning, evidently for
another sack, when tne men made a rut,b
at him. McGinniss jumped into his buggy
and whipped up his horÃe, but the animal
balked, and he was pulled from the buggy
and detained till Policeman Durkin was
notified.
The police took possession of the horse
and buggy and the stolen sack of barley,
which will be used as evidence against
McGinniss.
TUBERCULOSIS IN DUCKS
The Board of Health Doesn't Yet
Know What to Do
About It
An Inspection of Duck Ranches and
a Test of Live Fowls Will
Ec Made.
The Board of Health is confronted with
the problem of apprehending poultry mi
i fected with tuberculosis, and it is at a loss
| what course to pursue.
It was learned recently that ducks are
sometimes victims of the disease so much
dreaded by humanity. Ducks' livers,
white-spotted with tuberculosis, were
shown to the board, and the doctors
opened their eyes in surprise both at the
fact and at the lurking danger they saw to
the consumers of tame fowls.
Infected beef, mutton and pork can be
condemned at the slaughter-houses after
an examination of the lungs from the
carcasses shows that tuberculosis exists in
a particular instance. Milch cows can be
tested for the aisease by the injection of a
little tuberculin, followed by the applica
tion of a thermometer to ascertain if the
temperature has suddenly risen. But
ducks and chickens â they are not killed
at slaughter-houses. Tney are sold with
the entrails unremoved.
Livers and gizzards tnat so often consti
tute the principal part of dainty dishes
may be pregnant with the germs of con
sumption, and yet at present the board
sees no way of checking the traffic in con
taminated fowls. The existence of tuber
culosis in one ducK examined in a market
would not warrant the destruction of the
whole lot. Each fowl would have to be
opened and examined. Such a tedious
undertaking is not possible of perMpni
ance by one market mspector.iflwho
must also inspect beef, mutton and pork,
the output of over a score of big slaughter
houses.
What the board intends to do is to send
Market Inspector Davia on a tour of the
duck ranches that supply the City mar
kets. If some of them are maintained
under particularly unhealthful conditions,
or if a test of some of the ducks discloses
the existence of tuberculosis, then some
thing uerinite will be known as to the
I doubtful sources and where to be suspi
cious in future.
It is known that many of the duck
ranches are supplied with offal and en
trals from slaughter-houses, and in this
way the disease may have been contracted
by the fowls. But the duck will eat any
thing, and there are numerous ways in
wbich the infection may have spread.
Market Inspector Davis said yesterday
that he will probably try the injection of
tuberculin when he visits tbe duck
ranches, although he does not yet know
just how little might prove fatal to so
small an animal.
Ran Over a Bicyclist.
Robert McCullough, driver of a soda water
wagon, knocked over* E. M. Cushman, a boy,
who was riding a bicyle on Market and Powell
streets, yesterday morning. The boy was un
injured, but Detective Silvey, who saw the
affair, placed McCullough under arrest on the
charge of battery. Silver said it looked to
him as if McCullough had deliberately run
over the boy.
In Prussia the price ot medicine is regu
lated by the State, and a new price-list is
issued annually.
RAILROAD ECONOMY
SICKENS PATRONS
Bitter Complaint of the Oak
land Ferry Passen
gers.
DRIVEN FROM THE CABIN
Nauseating Odors Overcome the
Ladies on a Ferry-
Boat
CAUSED BY CHEAP FLOORING.
Linoleum and Linseed Oil H;ated by
the Funnsl Empty the Salon
Daily.
The passengers who are so unfortunate
as to have to travel across the bay on the
ferry steamer Oakland complain louldy
against the latest evidence of Southern
Pacific economy. This sign of frugality,
or worse, is brought to the attention of
patrons of the ferry-boats in a most in
sistent and obnoxious manner. And the
result is that people are driven out of the
cabin to parade the upper decK or suffer
the multitudinous odors of downstairs.
But even the outer decks, unprotected
as they are aeainst tbe winds and cold, or
the lower half of the boat with its oils and
kitchen smells and all its other discom
forts, is said to De a decided relief in com
parison with five minutes' experience of
the interior of the Oakland's cabin. For
within the glass doors there is an over
powering, offensive effluvium of a charac
ter wholly indescribable, tnough, indeed,
the periume of burning fish oil in an ad
vanced stage of putrefaction might sug
gest its peculiarity.
It is certain that the ladies cannot bear
the stench, and that men evade the Oak
land's cabin. In more than one instance
when tbe elements compelled ladies to
seek tbe shelter of the cabin they became
nauseated and remained sick for hours
afterward. Such is tbe testimony of some
young women who cross the bay daily in
pursuit of their business in San Francisco.
Should they go aboard the Oakland they
now remain downstairs or seek a shel
tered spot in the open, where passengers
crowd to avoid the cabin. And this ex
plains why so many ladies are seen on the
lower deck among wagons, baggage and
undesirable fellow-passengers.
The cause of it all is an "improvement"
recently added to the Oakland. When the
carpet wore out in the cabin it was not
replaced as usual by another one. In
stead a cheap kind of linoleum was laid
down. The next step was to give it a coat or
two of boiled linseed oil, which, it appears,
has the effect of preserving the pattern,
and also the linoleum itself. It was all
very well until the boilers began to give
up their heat through the great lunnel
running through the cabin. Then a new
and an altogetner original and noisome
smell filled the ladies' salon â the odor of
heated linoleum of shoddy quality, mixed
with that of "sweating" linseed oil.
As the funnel continues to give out heat
sufficient to keep up the sickening stench,
the comfort of the ferry patrons is still
seriously disturbed.
"It is awful; it is terrible; it makes
my head ache and then I feel sick," one
young lady was heard to exclaim. "Worse
than fish oil and positively unbearable. I
never go into the cabin of the Oakland
any more. Ido wish the company would
do something to stop the smell, or, if not,
throw out that frightful stuff."
She spoke the sentiments of many of
the regular travelers over the bay, who
are one and all loud in tneir demands for
a change that will permit them to sit in
the cabin of the Oakland ferry-boat.
Feddlers' Assistants.
Judge Conlan decided last week that a
licensed peddler might employ men to as ist
him without the men being required to take
'out a license. Justice of the Peace Carroll,
who is acting as a Police Judge, yesterday
coincided with that decision and dismissed
the cases against Henry Hentzell, Gus Lin
stead, Louis Matzoll, Charles Kehnsand Philip
I^eviskey, who were represented by Attorneys
Mc-Ciresor and Kenuy. The Justice said he
could not underfltand why a peddler's assistant
should be required to have a license any more
than a bartender who sells liquor in a saloon.
The smell of finely scraped horseradish
is said to be an effectual cure for head
ache.

DEMOCRATS WHO
OPPOSE NEW GODS
The Anti-Bryan Democracy
of California Is Now
Organized.
THOUSANDS ARE IN LINE
The Parent and the Directing
Sound-Money Democratic
Club.
WILL MAKE THINGS LIVELY.
Election Laws May Prevent an Eleo
toral Ticket, but They Will
"Go a-Fishing."
The leading sound-money Democrats of
San Francisco who are inclined to stand
by the basic principles of the Democratic
party, and who will not lend their support
to Bryanism and the present Populistic
platform of the party, have started, under
promising auspices, their organized effort
to express their political beliefs, amd to
co-operate witn the strong and widespread
sound-money and anti-Bryan movement
in the party, which will result in a Na
tional convention at Indianapolis in Sep
tem t>er 2.
The Sound-Money Democratic Club of
San Francisco was organized day before
yesterday at a conference held at the Pal
ace Hotel by thirty-two leading and influ
entialjmembers of the Democratic party.
This form of organization was decided
upon instead of that of a "State Central
Committee" and the other forms of regular
party organization. This club will, how
ever, be the leading and directing power
in this political movement in California,
will actively enroll the many thousand
conscientious and clear-headed Democrats
who are in sympathy with the movement,
will encourage the formation of other
sound-money Democratic clubs through
out the State, distribute campaign litera
ture extensively and generally co-operate
with the National Committee.
This meeting was a voluntary getting
together of representative men with a
common purpose ana a common political
conviction. The temporary organization
of the club named was decided upon and
Edward R. Taylor was made temporary
chairman, Elliott McAllister temporary
secretary and A. A. yv'atkins temporary
treasurer. John P. Irish, wno has been
especially active in promoting the move
ment, read letters and telegrams from
leading Eastern Democrats asking and
urging an organization in California.
Those who attended tbe meeting and
before adjournment signed the roll of the
new club were the following: Edward R.
Taylor, A. A. Watkins, T. C. Van Ness,
John Rosenfeld, Charles Page, Henry F.
Fortmann, Charles Colman, R. M. Welch,
N. Goldtree, John Heenan, John P. Irish,
J. W. McDonald, John J. O'Farrell, W.
W. Arnmrone, E. B. Pond, Â£. S. Heller,
Robert Y. Hayne, William Thomas, H.
Stephenson Smith, J. H. Meredith. T. B.
Berry, Jeremiah Lynch, R. T.Van Norden,
Curtis Hillyer, Charles P. Eells, M. F.
Michael, Colin M. Smith, Walter Perry
Johnson, George Davis. Boyd, Elliott Mc-
A.lister, Alexander Boyd, Emil Pohli.
The constitution adopted for the club
provides for the usual officers and an ex
ecutive committee of twenty-one mem
bers to be appointed Dy the president,
said committee to be divided into sub
committees on headquarters, finance, lit
erature, publication, distribution and
membership, to be appointea by the chair
man of the executive committee.
Articles 111, IV and V of the very brief
constitution are as follows:
Membershipâ Any person who voted for the
National Democratic ticket of 1892 may be
come a member upon payment of a fee of $1.
Declaration of Principlesâ This club is op
posed to tbe free, unlimited and independent
coinage of silver at the r.-itio of 16 to 1.
Objectsâ The objects of the club shall be:
First, to purchase or print and circulate
among the people of the State such literature
as may in the opinion of the executive com
mittee be useful in maintaining the cause of
"sound money"; second, to take such further
steps to effect the same object as may be deter
mined upon from time to time by the club.
The executive committee of the club
will perform in a general way such duties
as would have devolved upon a State Cen
tral Committee had such a form of party
organization been decided upon.
The main reason why a party organiza
tion was not adopted was that under the
election laws of this State nominees would
have to go on the ballots as independent
candidates backed by the necessary peti
tions, as the heading, "Democratic, Re
gally belongs to the Bryan cud of the De
mocracy.
This complication, it is more than
likely, will prevent the nomination in this
State of sound-money electors in support
of General Bragg or whoever may become
the Presidential nominee of the National
Bound-money Convention.
To get such electors on the official gen
eral ballot throughout the State as inde
pendent State officers would reauire the
riling at Sacramento of a petition signed
by about 8500 voters. While there are
several times that number of Democrats
in California who will not vote for Bryan,
and who are in sympathy with the heroic
Btand of the best elements of the party in
behalf of Jeffersonian party principles, it
is yet doubtful whether or not there will
be made the effort to get the necessary
signatures to make an electoral ticket of
practical effect. When Secretary Elliott
McAllister was asked yesterday what the
Bound-money Democrats of California
would be able to do for the prospective
Bound-money Presidential candidate, he
said: "We will probably go fashing for
him."
While the sound-money Democrats here
and elsewhere expect to win nothing,
their motives being purely patriotic ones.
they promise to make an enormous hole
in the Bryan vote in this State, and the
party leaders are greatly alarmed at the
rise of the organization, the strength ofthe
movement and tbe certain effect on the
Bryan campaign of the extensive literary
md stump campaign work which will be
Jone by the earnest sound-money Demo
:rats.
Thousands of the Democrats in this
State will vote for McKinley and thou
sands more who put party principles and
iheir consciences on a higher plane than
;be temporary winning oi a few offices by
!he allied Populists, will in effect vote
igainst Bryan by "going a-fishing" on
slection day.
Yesterday the circulation of blank mem
bership rolls by ail members and friends
>f the new club was begun, and the total
jnrollment promises to reach into the
thousands.
The club will meet again at the call of
-he chair on either Saturday or Monday
lext. At this meeting permanent organ
zation will De effected. Then or soon
.hereafter the executive committee will
te announced, and this executive com
nittee will at once decide on the plans,
cope and methods of the campaign work
hat will be at once instituted.
The most notable of the letters read at
â he initial meeting was a long one from
Utorney John T. Doyle, in which he ex
messed his regrets at not being able to at
tend the meeting, gave his hearty support
to the, movement and ably and vigorously
expressed his opinions on the present-day
position of his party and on the financial
question. Mr. Doyle's interesting letter
was as follows:
August 15, 1896.
Secretary Sound Money Democratic Club of
San Francisco â Dear Sib: I shall be absent
from the city on Tuesday, and cannot be pres
ent at your intended meeting, but I am thank
ful to Mr. Galpin for suggesting my name as a
member of the proposed organization, as I am
to any gentleman who affords me the oppor
tunity to testify my opposition to any kind of
fiat money, of whatever material made, and to
unite in an effort to avert from our country
such a dire calamity as c change in our stand
ard of values would entail.
My first earnest interest in politics, or in
public affairs, was in the Presidential election
of 1832, when "Old Hickory" stood like a lion
against the United States Bank on the issue of
hard money, against bank paper. Ever since
that time the party that elected him hag stood
for hard money; that is, honest money, or
mo^ey worth its face in value, the world
over. The National Convention which lately
assembled at Chicago has abandoned this car
dinal doctrine of the Democratic faith, and
adopted a platform of brand-new principles
subversive of those that have guided us for
seventy years back, and which ignores the
experience of all nations (including our own
on a question deeply affecting the interests of
every man in the community, whether poor or
rich, gentle or simple. Having abandoned
the principles of Democracy it has no claim to
the allegiance of Democrats. I for one spit it
out, and refuse to accept this crazy fad of tree
silver at a lying ratio of sixteen to one at the
dictation of any body of men, however numer
ous or enthusiastic they may be. This aban
donment of principle is the more base, be
cause obviously made only to catch votes
and obtain office and power. The abasement
of the party was the price for the
promise ot support from a horde of Adul
lamitesof which Coxey's army that marched
to Washington a couple of years since was
fairly representative. The demand for free
silver originates with men who own silver
mines and want a customer for their wares,
of which they are producing more than the
market will take and which have consequently
fallen in price. The rank and file of their fol
lowers are, in part, ignorant people who, like
their candidate, Mr. Bryan, believe that prices
can be regulated by act of Congress, and in
part of unthinking ones who accept blindly
the political teachings of some clique or
committee merely on the strength of its name.
The coinage of the precious metals is abso
lutely nothing more nor less than the certifi
cate of the Government that the particular
piece of money contains a particular quantity
ot silver or gold of a certain fineness. The
American gold dollar contains 25 8-10 grains
of standard gold and our silver dollar 412 8-10
grains of standard silver, being just sixteen
times as heavy as that made of gold. For
eighty yeÂ»rs after the foundation of the
Government the two metals bore to each other
a value so nearly in this proportion (16 to 1)
that no inconvenience resulted from the two
dollars being called by the same name and in
domestic and retail transactions they became
interchangeable. The relative value did, how
ever, vary from time to time, as is known to all
who have had any occasion to study the subject
and in large transactions and in foreign tnide
their market value always controlled. As an
instance of this, I may mention that in 180 l
and 1852 I was in a position requiring me to
use considerable sums of silver, amounting to
between $200,000 and $300,000. I had to
pay a premium of never less than 4 percent
for every dollnr of it, because at that time sil
ver was worth a little more tnan one-sixteenth
of its weight in gold. The discoveries in
Washoe reversed this state of things, and the
opening of the new mines in the Sierra
Nevada and Rocky Mountains, with improvec
methods of reducing ores, has deprecialed
silver so that it now tekes over thirty ounces
of silver to buy one of gold, and we realize the
mistake of having called the two coins by the
same name without any legal term to distin
guish them apart; for people are thus led to
assume that there is some natural equality be
tween them, which has been improperly de
stroyed by legislation. If one of them had
been called by another name, as a peso, or a
piastre or a ducat, ihe case would have been
quite different. If Congress would now enact
that the gold dollar shall be stamped and
named as such, aud the silver doliar stamped
and named as a silver one, and that contracts
may be expressed and enforced in either sort
of money at the option oi the parties, there
would be no opposition on the part
of the advocates of sound money to
the free and unlimited coinage of both
metals. That would be real bimetallism; both
silver and gold would be used for money, and
contracting parties would be free to choose to
suit themselves; their relative values would
vary with that of the metals, but they would
circulate side by side. But the bimetallists of
the silver school will never agree to that.
What they want is to substitute a silver stand
ard for the present, which is confessedly a
gold one, and such substitution, wnile prob
ably profitable to the owners of silver mines,
will certainly entail on the people an amount
of financial "suffering and ruin beyond any
thing that the country has ever yet experi
enced since the foundation of the Government.
The limits of a letter forbid any adequate
discussion of these results in detail, but let us
take the case oi depositors in savings banks as
an example. The Commissioners' official re
port shows that there are in our California
saviugs banks over $130,000,000. These
funds are the savings of the industrious
poor. They represent the economies of
laborious and frugal people, who are striving
to lay up from the wages of honest toil some
little provision for old age, or for dependent
children or relatives. They are peculiarly
sacred against spoliation, and the church ex
pressly denounces as one of the sins that
cry to heaven for vengeance that of "defraud
ing laborers of their wages." These hundred
and thirty millions are almost entirely the
wages of labor, and the proposal to confiscate
or depreciate them or to pay them in any
money less valuable than gold is distinctly a
proposal to defraud laborers of their wages
They have been all deposited in those banks
in gold coin. Any small sums that were in
other currency had the promise of the United
States Government behind tnem to redeem in
gold and so were equal to it. These moneys
had to be lent out, to eafrn interest for
the depositors, and they are represent
ed by mortgages on real property and
by bonds of the Government and of municipal
ities and corporations. Twenty-four millions
are invested in "stocks and bonds," of which
probably more than one-half are bonds of the
United States, once deemed the best security
in the world, now unhappily no longer so.
What will be the effect on these securities of
the election of Mr. Bryan on his Iree-silver
platform? It is very easy to foresee. If elected
he will take office on March 4. On the follow
ing Ist of April a quarter's interest on the
United States five per cent? will become due.
Either he will be false to all his principles, to
his party pledges and platform, and to his own
manhood, or he will p*y that interest in silver,
and the United States bonds, which now sell
at 109, will go down immediately on his elec
tion in anticipation of such action, to some
where below 90. All other American stocks
and securities will go with them, and by this
tumble alone the depositors of California sav
ings banks will lose at a single blow from
$6,000,000 to $10,000,000.
This, however, will be but the smallest part
of their losses; they have invested on mort
gages on real estate $102,000,000, all of which
are doubtless promised in gold coin, as Lovell
White's card has informed us. But supposing
this mongrel candidacy, begotten by Populism
on Democracy, should succeed at the election,
who can believe that the men who have so lit
tle National pride or regard for the honor of
their country as to pay its debts in depreciated
coin will have any more respect for private
debts than tor those of the public T How can
they justify insisting that the farmer shall be
held to pay in gold when the Government of
the United States, administered by themselves,
takes advantage of a quibble to pay in silver
worth 53 cents on the dollar? Talk about
specific contracts and decisions of the Supreme
Court! It will not take those gentry, if they
get control, three weeks to wipe them all out
of the statute-book like so much mere rubbish.
Are people who talk of relying on specific-con
tract laws aware that they have already smug
gled on the statute-book of this State a law in
tended to frustrate our own specific-contract
law, and which, if it has failed to accomplish
its purpose, has only failed by reason of the
ignorance of the people who got it up? 'Laws
1880, page 8.)
But suppose I am wrong in this forecast and
that conservative men may be able to avert
any Immediate change in our laws or in the
organization of. the courts, is that good fortune
bo plainly in sight that can expect prudent
bankers like Lovell White and other gentle
men who for thirty years back have managed
so wisely the savings banks of the City to trust
to it ano allow loans to run on unpaid and
overdue, simply because they believe the gen
tlemen Populists who control the new party
will not respond to the demands of their fol
lowers and paBS any of the radical legislations
demanded by them ? That would be to ask
them to renounce the lessons of prudence and
the honortble name which they have deserved
by a lifetime of successful financial manage
ment. And they will not do it. The an
nouncement of Mr. Bryan's election will be
the signal for the calling in of loans and the
foreclosure of mortgages on a scale never before
witnessed in California. No new loans will be
made, for the same reason that very few are
made now, viz. : that no one knows what will

lor the usurer will tell them that he has no
sort of certainty, but that the dividend, when

If you trace this business out to ultimate re
sults you will see that it leads directly to dis
tress and calamity to California deeper and
worse than all the losses the State has sus
tained from all the destructive fires and floods
of the past forty years put together. All hon

CHEATED A LOAN ASSOCIATION
Conning Scheme of a Husband Who
Claimed to Be a Widower.
The San Francisco Mutual Loan Asso
ciation has sued William Eowden and his
wife, Caroline Bowden.foran accounting on
certain promissory notes, secured by mort
gages on Hayes and Haven streets prop
erty. It is claimed that Bowden secured
a loan on a homestead by representing
that his wife had died, and that he was
sole owner of the property.
It seems that Bowden originally bor
rowed $1000 from the building association,
and took several shares of its capital
stock. He then borrowed $600 more, giv
ing as security mortgages on a homestead
property on Hayes street. Mrs. Bowden
joined him in giving the mortgage. Later
Bowden borrowed $700 on the Haven
street real estate, He took out capital
stock of the association equal to the
amount of the loans.
Bowden subsequently made payments
which reduced tne amount owing to the
association to about $1400. He then rep
resented that his wife bad died and had all
his promissory notes and mortgages can
celed, received overs3ooin money and gave
the association a new mortgage for $1800
on the Hayes-street homestead. It now
transpires that Mrs. Buwden is alive, and

SWEENEY HAS HIS INNING
He Declares That in No Way
Was the Jury
Bribed.
He Says He Did Not Meet J. L
Salomon Downtown Alter the
Verdict Was Rendered.
Judge Daingerfield occupied himself
mainly yesterday In sifting out the truth
in the story of jury bribing in the case of
the Lombard Loan Company against R. I.
Whelan and others, Judah Boas being the
"and others" on the side of the defense.
The affidavits filed by Boas bolstering
up his plea for a new trial were fully
quoted in yesterday's issue^f The Call.
Foreman J. F. Sweeney of the jury
called on Judge Daingerfield yesterday to
make a voluntary statement which be sub
sequently made to a Call reporter, relat
ing incidents that occurred in and out of
the jury-room during the trial which co to
disprove the story of bribes being offered
or accepted.
"I was one of those who voted for a ver
dict in favor of the plaintiff. I did it be
cause I regarded the incorporation papers
of the Lombard Loan Company as being
legal, and that the defendants had no right
to attach the property on the supposition
that It belonged to another institution
owing them certain amounts.
"At the dinner table, prior to rendering
a verdict, Mr. Toboas and I sat apart from
the others, and he certainly never hinted
in any way that there was money in it for
my vote, either on one side or another, as
Mr. Dolan claims he spoke to him in the
affidavit just filed.
"When it came to a vote Toboas was
against a verdict, first and last. This is a
fact, even if Dolan does say in his affidavit
that he switched three or four times.
Juror Baum and another both voted the
same as Toboas, and Dolan voted as I and
seven others did, in favor of the plaintiff.
I do not see, therefore, where any bribery
could have taken Dlace.
"Now, as to this man Crawford, he of
tbe black mustache, who is said to have
been hanging about the courtroom and
the corridors during the trial, I do not
know, nor do I remember seeing any such
person. There was a photographer named
E. Isaacs, a friend of mine, with whom I
do politics, who used to call out and see
me frequently. He has a dark mustache,
and I really believe he is the man they
call Crawford. His calls upon me were
purely out of friendship and for socia
bility's sake; nothing more."
Mr. Sweeney's attention was called to
the affidavit made on the strength of a
orivate detective's report to the effect that
after the $2000 veidict was rendered he
met J. L. Salomon, one of the parties
benefited, in a cigar-store at Ellis and
Market streets. This affidavit relates also
that Crawford and one of the attorneys for
the plaintiff wsre present.
"This is absolutely false," Mr. Sweeney
stated. "I never met Mr. Saiomon before
or after the verdict at this or any other
cigar-store or saloon. In leaving the
courtroom, in the corridor of the City
Hall, Mr. Salomon thanked me for the
verdict, and I told him there was no need
of his thanks â I had done my duty, and
that was all. No other words were passed
between us, and I 'never have spoken to
him or seen him since."

Mary's to be pronounced man and wife.
Archbishop Riordan will officiate at the
ceremony that is to unite "for better or

The wedding of to-day will be the happy
culmination of a romance begun in child
hood's days. It is an old story of childish
friendship ripening into the mature love

his abilities as an. attorney, tbe brilliant
qualities of his mind and the many ster
ling traits that make him a worthy citizen

lady who has been wont to hide her many
attainments. She is an admirable musi

Napa. She is the sister of Mrs. J. B. Hop
kins and Mrs. Hilaire Belloc, wife of the
well-known English lecturer on political
economy. Henry Hogan, the attorney, of
Napa, is her brother, and Walter Bartnett
of the firm of Gunnison, Booth & Bart
nett, is a cousin of the lady.
The cathedral on Van Ness avenue,
where the ceremony is to be performed,
will be elaborately decorated with flowers â

TWELVE YEARS IN COURT
A School-Teacher's Struggle to
fe Recover Her Prop
erty.
She Invests in a Patent That Was to
Revo utioniz^ the Metallurgi
cal World.
After a twelve years' struggle in the
courts Mrs. H. S. Kelly of Martinez will,
in a few days, no doubt regain possession
of a valuable tract of land which she was
prevailed upon to deed away for no vnin
able consideration.
D. M. Delmas, in a telling argument, has
presented the facts before the Supreme
Court for the second time that the case has
been there.
E. M. Gibson, for the appellant, William
Owens, executor of the estate of H. K.
Owens, proposed to submit the matter on
briefs; but Mr. Delmas opposed it. He
wanted to tell the facts he said.
About the beginning of the year 1884, he
said, Mrs. H. S. Kelly, a widow, employed
at teaching school, was the owner of three
quarters of a section of land in Contra
Costa County. There lived in the neigh
borhood at the time two individuals, Dr.
R. H. Lee and one fl. K. OwenÃ. They
represented that Dr. Lee was the discov
erer and inventor of a new method of
mating a superior quality of fine steel
and merchantable iron from pigiron or
iron ore direct. They declared tbe dis
covery would revolutionize the metallurgi
cal world, and promised big returns to all
who would buy tne stock of the proposed
company. Â»
The poor people about Martinez were
fascinated with the prospects held oat and
mortgaged their property and borrowed
money to buy stock.
Mrs. Kelly transferred her property out
right to Owens on a basis of a valuation of
$20,000, receiving in return 55,240 shares of
stock, worth just the value of tbe paper it
was written on.
Ten days afterward Owens transferred
the property to his wife. An exposure
soon followed and Mrs. Kelly sued to re
cover the property. She employed at first
Judge Catlin of Sacramento.
She won a verdict in the Superior Court,
but the Supreme Court reversed the judg
ment and ordered a new trial. Again the
lower court gave her judgment, and again
it was appealed. It was on this second
appeal that the case came before the Su
preme Court, Mr. Delmas presenting it
this time. Mrs. Kelly confidently expects
a confirmation of the judgment of the
lower court this time, and that after
twelve years of failure and struggle her
own will be returned to her.

NAGLE AS A SLOGGER.
The Heavy - Weight Lawyer
Knocks Out A. R. Smith on
Market Street
Difference of Opinion Led to the Un
pleasant Denouement of Calling
a Man a Liar.
Two "biffs" with the right hand, pro
pelled by the muscular power of Charles
j Grant Nagle, the attorney, had the effect
of glueing the 6 feet high and the 220
pounds in weight of human flesh and bone
of Adrian R. Smith, the late secretary of
tne Fotrrth of July celebration, against
the front ot the building at. 632 Market
street on last Friday afternoon.
Not content with flattening the burly
form of the handsome Smith against the
wall, Nagle brought a stream of crimson
fluid down his opponent's face by cutting
a gash over the left eye tnat required a
few stitches ot the surgeon's needle to
close.
Nagle has not stood very high in the
opinion of Smith for some time past, but
they had not met in such close quarters
as to permit the late secretary of the Na
tion's anniversary to tell what he thought
of him until Friday afternoon, when
Nagle waa engaged in conversation with
his brother lawyer, Henry C. Schaertzer,
on Market street in front of his (Nagle's)
office, when the ponderous form of Smith
hove in sight.
It did not take long for Smith to tell
Nagle that he was a liar, and it required
less time for Nagle to send his right hand
and arm against Smith's head. A second
blow followed the first in such rapid suc
cession that Smith saw the stars over the
Palace Hotel.
In the meantime Schaertzer got between
the two men and held Nagle bac* until
other charitable friends interfered and
took the late secretary off to a friendly
drug store, where a patch of oourtplaster
was spread across the gap on the side of
his head.
The fighting attorney who objected to
being called a liar retired to his office and
narrated the encounter to some friends
whom he met.
Since the unpleasantness the ex-secre
tary has not taken his usual afternoon
walks on the fashionable promenades of
the City. v
CHILDREN EVICTED.
A Compassionate Aunt Promises to Care
for Them and Takes Them From
Their Mother's Charge.
A day or so ago Mrs. Mary McCarthy and
her four children were evicted from their
late lodgings at 26 Harriet street for sev-,
eral months' non-payment of rent. The
children were taken in charge by a Mrs.
Roach, a sister of Mrs. McCarthy's de
ceased husband, who promises to
care for their maintenance and education.
Mrs. Roach, who lives at 1313 Minna street,
seems to heve an indifferent opinion of
her sister-in-law, with whom shs has had
no dealings for years. The neighbors re
fer to Mrs. McCarthy as being unfit to
have charge of her children, owing to her
alleged fondness for low company. The
woman's present whereabouts is un

GREAT VICTORY ?
Disease is the enemy of those attributes which make the
great, noble and successful man. It insidiously creeps upon
him so stealthily that at first he is hardly aware of its presence,
and it seems of so little consequence that it is often neglected
until it becomes so well established in the system that it reÂ«
quires the utmost skill ofthe most competent and experienced
physician to dislodge it. DOCTOR SWEANY, acknowledged as
the leading specialist of America, has been fighting the bat-
tles against this arch enemy of mankind for the last twenty-
five years with that courage and determination which have won
for him a great and
POSITIVE VICTORY
Which has placed him foremost among the most noted and
successful physicians of the age, and heralded his fame to the
four corners of the earth.

the healing art, but cover the whole field of medicine and dis-
ease. Chronic and lingering diseases have received his spe-
cial study, and his success In effecting cures has stamped him

skill. If you are afflicted with any disease you are indeed un-
fortunate, for with ill-health all the pleasures of life are lost.
If such Is your condition you owe yourself a duty, and that
duty is to get cured. The time to see the Doctor is the moment
you realize that you are paying the penalties for the violation of

the clouds were heavy and a pall hung
over the cities. Half an hoar later, when
everything was sunshiney and without a
moment's warning the rain began to fÂ»ll
in great big drops.
There was one peal of thunder and a
flash of lightning, but no one paid any at
tention to them, and it was only when the
rain began to fall that anybody thought
there was a summer shower in progress,
and that the garden hose would not be re
quired for at least twenty- four hours.
Out at Point Lo bos the storm had full
sway and John Hyslop, the Merchants'
Exchanee observer, had a narrow escape.
The lightning struck the flagpole which
adjoins the signal station and split it from
cap to base. The electric spark flew along
the guys and communicated with the ob
servatory. Hyslop was on watch, how
ever, and before any damage was done be
had all the wires under control. His con
nections with the Merchants' Exchanee
were all burnt out and it was late in tne
evening before he could secure direct com
munication.
The public did not suffer, however, as
John made regular trips to the Cliff House
and from that point sent in his dispatches.
It was the hardest day's work tne clever
observer has put in in years, but Hyslop
doesn't mind so long as the Exchange gets
the news in time.
The storm struck San Rafael, Tiburon
and Sausalito also. Rain fell steadily in
those places for ten minutes, but the elec
trical display was absent. In fact, the
only point at which the lightning struck
was Point Lobos and the only sufferer waa
John Hyslop and the Exchange.

attracted the attention of the postal au

swipe," was addressed 10 Uncle Sam's
mail-handlers and was intended to bid
them not to burglarize the envelope. The
letter was addressed to Attorney L. E.
Phillips, whose office is at 405 Montgom
ery street, and there is a long story con
nected with the letter and its author, for
the latter bade Mr. Phillips an adieu
which was more sarcastic than affection
ate.
Some six or seven months ago a medium-
Bized, well-built young man, whose man
ners were polished and insinuating', vrhosa
voice was smcoth, soft and well modu
lated and whose dress was stylish and un
exceptionable, came into San Francisco.
He gave the name of Cyrus D. Noble, and
his occupation was that of agent for the
Dcs Moine s Life Association. He had no
difficulty in ingratiating himself into
the favor of many men around
town, professional and other*. He
speedily knew physicians, lawyers, den
tists and others, and was a prime iavorite
with many young ladies He was duly
commissioned ny D. R. Hubbard, the su
perintendent of agencies, who has his of
fices at Dcs Moines, to get business for
the company, and he proceeded to do this
with vigor and success. He did business
in Los Angele?, Stockton, Sacramento,
Fresno. San Jose, and, in a word, in about
all the towns and cities of any size in Cal
ifornia. The home office at Dcs Moines
seemed to be thoroughly satisfied with the
outlook, and for a period of about six
months Mr. Noble, natty and self-con
tained, was a familiar personage on Mont
gomery and Market street"-.
When Attorney L. E. Phillips opened
his letter yesterday, which on the exterior
bore the "Don't swipe" injunction, his key
feil out. It was the key to his office,
which has for some lime been in the pos
session of Cyru3 D. Noble. Some time
last February Cyrus D. Noble invited At
torney Phillips to be attorney for the Dcs
Moines Life Association. He made a nice
little speech in which he asserted that he
had heard very favorably of Mr. Jfailiipi
as a corporation lawyer. He closed with
the offer of Â» salary of $500 per annum, to
be payable semi-annually in installments
of $250. Not long after that Mr. Noble su^
pested that if Mr. Phillips were only
nearer the place of business which Mr.
NobJe desired to occupy, it would be much
more convenient for purposes of consulta
tion, if legal questions should ari?e, wh'ch
Mr. Noble said, might be expected to be
frequently the case."
Before this interview was over Mr.
Noble had eneagcl Mr. Phillips' outer
office at the rate of $10 per month. Di
rectly thereafter Mr. Noble was installed
at 405 Montgomery street, put out his sign
on the outer hallway and on the door of
the office, and with his customary vigor
and adroitness invited the public to come
in. The people went in. There was a
continual procession of young women.
"My one fault," said Mr. Noble to Mr.
Phillips, "is that I am a lady killer."
One day .a young woman, who is en
gaged in a Montgomery -street office, went
to an attorney and wanted to know what
she could do to make Mr. Noble fill an
alleeed promise to marry her. She is a
handsome brunette, witn snapping black
eyes, petite, with regular and attractive
features and vivacious to a degree. She
paid that Mr. Noble had promised to marry
her on the occasion of their second meet
ing, but he seemed to be a little backward.
In the meantime Mr. Noble's clientele of
ladies appeared to be on the increase.
Just about as Mr. Phillips' first install
ment of salary was due from Mr. Nobie as
attorney for the Dcs Moines Life Associa
tion, Mr. Noble dropped out of siebt.
There were at that time, and, in fact, still
are, several months payments for office
rent cue to Mr. Phillips in arrears, and
with the six months salary due, Mr.
Noble had quite a score against him alto
gether. Mr. Phillips did not know until
yesterday where Mr. Noble had gone; not
until he received the letter before men
tioned, which was dated at Portland, Or.,
and was written on a letter-head of the
Portland Hotel. A part of the letter was
as follows :
"I am sorry that I did not see you be
fore leaving the City, as I wanted to see
you very badly. Good-by. You should
be very much obliged to me for obtaining
for you the position of attorney for the Dcs
Moines Life Association. It makes no dif
ference what occurs in the future or what
changes come, for if you stick to the Dcs
Moines Life Association you will have
money to born."
Mr. Phillips was not greatly
assured by this letter for he had already
received a letter from Mr. Hubbard of Dcs
Moines, in which the last named gentle
man said that Mr. Noble had no authority
to make any contracts on behalf of the
company. This letter also contained the
information that prior to his engagement
the company knew very little about "Mr.
Noble, but that his address and manner
had inspired sufficient confidence in Nobie
to secure for him the agency which he filled
in San Francisco.
While Attorney Phillips does not quite
nee how be is going to gÂ»Â»t even if Mr.
Noble does not return, and the letter from
Portland is interpreted to mean a final
adieu, there are others in the City who
would also like to interview Mr. 'Noble
and receive from him some of the good
hard coin of the realm.
One of these is John Barduhn, tailor,
who does business on the east side of
Kearny street, near Market. Mr. Bar
duhn told bis story last evening. He says
that be first made a suit of clothes for
Noble which was not paid for. Noble
persuaded him to have his life insured to
the amount of $1000 in the Dcs Moines
Life Association. Noble said that he need
not put up any cash, but that he would
bring around people to trade enough to
pay the premiums as they fell due. Mr.
Barduhn was persuaded to put np $10
cash for; insurance, and that left $31 due
for insurance which was to be paid in
trade. The clothes made for Noble not
beiue paid for, Barduhn grew uneasy and
finally secured in part payment a note for
$20, which had been given by Dr. Alex
ander McNeil, whose residence is on Van
Ness avenue, to Noble.
There is another story growing out of
this note according to Dr. McNeil. This
is that Noble came to him saying that be
desired to secure the services of a homoep
athic physician to examine applicants
for insurance. He requested Dr r McNeil
to take out an insurance policy, which Dr.
McNeil did, paying some cash and giving
the note of $.0 for the remainder with the
understanding that this note|could be paid
by services supplied in medical examina
tions. When Noble was pressed by Bar
duhn for payment for clothes supplied to
him he handed over this McNeil note as
casn.
Dr. Thomas L. Hill, who nas offices in
the Odd Fellows' building, is another San
Francisco citizen who desires to see Cyrus
D. Noble. Dr. Hill was persuaded to take
out a policy for $5000, so he says, which he
was to pay for in dentistry. The amount
of the premium was about $90. Dr. Hill
bas been surprised to find that hfi was
credited only $40 on the statement which
the Dcs Moine3 Life Association has trans
mitted to htm, whick leaves him liable to
pay $50 to square the account for insur
ance, where he had expected to put up no
cash, according to his understanding of
the verbal agreement had by him with
Noble.
Dr. Bryant, who is in the Flood build
ing, has a complaint to make, and so have
the peopie, according to Attorney Phil
lips, to whom these persons have come
for information. All the return tnat At
torney Phillips has received for rent for
his office and for legal advice is a credit
of $43 75, indorsed on a life poiicy which
he took out upon the representation that
the attorney of the corporation ought to
show his confidence in it by becoming one
of its policy-holders. The expectation is
entertained by Attorney Phillips that the
term of six months having expired, there
will soon be other persons heard from who
have been asked by the Dcs Moines .Life
Association to pay for premiums which
they expected were to be turned against
trade.
The signs which Mr. Noble caused to be
put up remain in their positions at 405
Montgomery street.
IS NOT LEGISLATIVE.
Crty and Connty Attorney CreÂ»weirÂ«
Opinion on the Power* of the
Board of Health.
City and Connty Attorney Cre?well has
rendered an opinion to the Board of Su
pervisors that the Board of Health has no
legislative functions, and that it mast ap
peal to the Board of Supervisors when it
desires the passage of legislative acts.
The communication is as follows:
To the Honorable, the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of San Francisco: I am iv
receipt oi a communication from the Commit
tee on Health and Police of your body, of
which the following is a copy, viz.: "The
Board of Health udopted an order entitled.
â¢Plumbing Rules and Regulations,' submitted
it to this board, requesting that it be consid
ered, adopted and incorporated in the general
i orders of the Board oi Supervisors. Your opin-
I ion is respectfully requested as to whether it
â  is necessary for this board to pass the &bove
| mentioned order, to the end that power may
i be conferred upon the Board of Health."
Under the constitution of the State the
Legislature ol the State and the Board of Su
| pervisors are clothed with legislative func-
I tions. The Legislature cannot constitution
ally delegate the power to legislate to any
! other authority or body. The Board of Health
has rio legislative functions. Hence, before
! anything of a legislative character in the
' plumbing rules and regulations can be made
landing it is necessary that the Board of Su
pervisors should put them into the form of,
and pass them as, air ordinance.
Everyihingin them will thereafter be binding
except such parts as may be in conflict with
some constitutional or statutory grounds.

CHARGES WITHOUT PROOF
Th?y Caused a Great Sensation
Among Local Stamp Col
lectors.
Georges Carion Has Received a Letter
of Exoneration From New
York.
A bout two weeks ago one of the greatest
sensations in the history of the local
philatelic, or stamp-collecting, fraternity
was produced by the publication of cer
tain charges made against Georges Carion
by his ex-clerk, George M. Schiller.
The latter claimed that be had intrusted
to his former employer a consignment of
French colonial stamps valued at $400,
and that Carion had taken certain valua
ble stamps from the books in which they
were fastened and bad substituted coun
terfeits and inferior specimens.
Schiller followed up this remarkable ac
cusation by securing a search warrant for
Carion' s presence with the object of re
covering the alleged missing stamps, but
the search was without result.
Meanwhile Carion, in the presence of
reliable witnessed, sealed the stamps,
among which were alleged to be the coun
terfeits, in an envelope and forwarded
them by registered mail to the consignors,
the Scott Stamp and Coin Company (lim
ited) of New York City, with the following
letter:
San Francisco, August 5, 1896.
Dear Sir: 1 have sent by registered mail tho
four books of French colonies, which you had
sent on approval to George M. Schiller, and
from which I have retained stamps to the
amount of $14 91, which amount I will remit
by next mail.
Please axamine the stamps very carefully, as
Mr. Schiller has insinuated that some of them
have been sal/Stituted or replaced by poor and
less valuable specimens. Please acknowledge
receipt of sumps to Mr. Schiller and let me
know at once about the matter.
This brought forth a prompt reply from
the New York firm, and one which Mr.
Carion and his friends consider a complete
refutation of the charges made by Mr.
Schiller. This communication follows:
New York, Au-rnst 11, 1896.
Georges Carion, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear
Sir: We have received your letter of the stti
and also the four approval books of French
colonies" stamps by registered mail. We find
your statement of account is correct, the net
amount of $14 90 having been removed.
We have looked through the books, and. so
far as we can remember and to the best of our
belief, the stamps remaining in the books are
those whi<h were originally there. Ag re
questtd, we shall write Mr. Schiller to this
effect.
In view of this exoneration of Mr. Carion
mystery shrouds the motive which
prompted the charges made by Schiller
and leaves the latter in a rather peculiar
position. Mr. Carion is inclined to looK
upon his ex-employe's action in a char
itable manner and attributes it to a hal
lucination.
MRS. LUX'S ALLOWANCE.
The Supreme Court Confirms Her
Title to the Monthly
Payment.
Two Supreme Court decisions were filed
yesterday, both having reference to the
allowance of $2500 a month awarded to
Mrs. Miranda W. Lnx after the decease of
her husband in 1883. The allowance was ob
jected to by the next of kin, generally re
erred to as the "German heirs," as being
excessively large. Mrs. Lux's death fur
ther complicated proceedings in the settle
ment of the estate. Meanwhile the
monthly payments of $2500 from the estate
have been accumulating and now sum up
quite a snug little fortune, as fortunes go
in these hard times.
Yesterday's decisions sustain the order
of the Superior Court, fixing Mrs. Lux's
allowance at the amount stated, though
the judgment is not unanimous, Justices
Henshaw and Temple signing a dissent
ing opinion. The accumulation of the de
ceased Mrs. Lux's pin-money will hence
form a portion of her estate, it being sug
gested by the court that her personal rep
resentatives and heirs have, succeeded to
her rights. The second decision further
confirms the allowance to the widow's
estate and sets aside the objection of the
German heirs to a final accounting.
THE SAN JTKA.MUISUO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 1896.
DEFENDANT RICHARD WILLIAMS AND HIS ATTORNEYS.
DICK WILLIAMS
FACES THE LAW,
His Trial Opens in the
United States District
Court.
CHINESE AGAINST HIM.
The Ex- Customs Inspector's Fate
in the Hands of Judge
and Jury.
ACCUSED ON FOUR COUNTS.
His Attorneys Contend That He Is
Not Guilty of Extortion and
Corruption.
Richard S. Williams, the ex-Castom
house inspector, accused on four indict- !
ments with having extorted money from [
Chinese and assisted in landing Chinese
at this port, was placed on trial yesterday
in the United States District Court before
Judge Morrow.
Williams was defended by Lyman I.
Mowry and T. C. Coogan, while Barclay
Henley appeared as special counsel for the
prosecution, with Assistant United States
Attorney Slessinger assisting him. Treas- !
ury Agent Moore and United States Mar
shal Barry Baldwin occupied chairs near !
the prosecuting attorneys. Williams him- i
self sat at one end of the long table beside
his counsel and appeared the least con
cerned man in the courtroom.
The morning session and part of the af
ternoon were spent in impaneling a jury, {
though there was little difficulty in find
ing men who knew nothing about Wil
liams and had no prejudices aeainst
Chinese as witnesses under oath. Every
man examined declared he was willing to
analyze the testimony of a Mongolian and
place it on an equal footing with that of a
Caucasian. The jury chosen to try the
case consists of C. S. Benedict, Joseph
Simonson, Henry J. Crocker, J. P. Cun
ingham, H. N. Tilden, Anpust F. Lawton,
Orlando Boeart, W. B. Bradford, P. 8.
Teller, W. T. Y. Schenck, Benjamin F.
Harville and Christian Englebretsen.
Barclay Henley, in his opening state
ment, claimed that the testimony would
show that Williams, while acting as
Chinese inspector for the purpose of as
sisting the Collector of the Port in 1895,
was guilty of the several acts with which
he is charged in the indictments from the
United States Grand Jury.
The first indictment is that of the land
ing of Ah Moy, a Chinese woman, in No
yeber, 1895. For $100 it was alleged Wil
liams landed her. The next charge is that
on September 18 last Williams secured the
landing of a Chinese named Wong Ling
Choy for a stipulated sum. A third in
dictment accuses the ex-Chinese inspector
of entering into another bargain with his
Chinese agent, this time to land Ching
See Hung for $85. The last accusation is
that of landing Wong Quock Flow for $90.
In each and every case it is charged tne
bargain was made and carried out success
fully.
"The proof," added Mr. Henley, "will
be to a large extent from the testimony of
Chinese, but it will be of such a character
that we shall expect of you, gentlemen of
the jury, a verdict of guilty."
Lyman I. Mowry asked that the indict
ments be taken up one at a time, so that
the jury could intelligently follow each in
dividual case. To this the court replied
that the testimony would be made appli
cable to each count.
The first witness called was John Lynch,
for the prosecution. Mr. Lyncb is a Chi
nese Inspector in this port. He had
known Williams for the past three years.
In September and November, 1895, there
were five inspectors in the Chinese Bu
reau, and at times extra men were em
ployed by the Collector to assist the bu
reau.
"W T hen Inspectors made investigations
they presented reports to the Collector?"
said Mowry.
â¢â¢Through the head of the bureau," re
plied the witness.
"An Inspector could not land a Chinese
himself?"
"No, sir."
"Nor the head of the bureau nor any In
spector without the order of the Collector
of the Port?"
"No, sir. Either the Collector or his
chief deputy, Mr. Tobin, should give per
mission."
Barclay Henley took up the case of Ah
Moy, who, the witness said, made appli
cation to the Collector of the Port to be
landed. Records of the landing of the
four Chinese were introduced in evidence
identified by Lynch as the official docu
ments of the Custom-bouse.
"Mr. Lynch, was there no farther evi
dence in the case of Ah Moy?" asked
Mowry.
"I don't know, sir: I presume it is all
there."
"Before you file a record in your office
all the evidence is there?".
"Yes, sir."
"In each of these cases?"
"Ye* sir."
"Then in each of these cases the testi
mony is all tiled here?"
''Yes, sir; it is supposed to be."
'â¢Ah, supposed to be. That's all," and
Mr. Mowry took his seat.
Then Mr. Henley questioned the witness
to bring out the fact by way of explana
tion that the documents contained all
documentary testimony, but did not
necessarily include oral testimony.
Donjr Tang testified that he lived at 737
Washington street when Ah Moy was
landed. He knew ber, and came from the
same family and province. He was a wit
ness for her when she applied for landing.
Two or three days before the woman was
landed he saw Williams with Tong Chee,
who is alleged to have raid Williams $100
for passing Ah Moy. Williams and Chee
spoke in a low tone, which the witness did
not hear.
"I saw Tong Chee eive $100 to Wil
liams," added the witness. "This was in
the general store of King Lung Chong on
Dupont street at 8 p. m., when Chow Sun,
the husband of Ah Moy, was present."
The defense contended that as the docu
mentary testimony of the prosecution, in
troduced as official records of the Custom
house, proved that Ah Moy was a citizrn
of the United States, she having been born
in San Jose and taken to Cuina at 8 years
of age, tnere could be no corruption or
offense against the laws for landing her.
Indeed, as a citizen of the United States
she was entitled to the right of landing.
The court overruled the objection, and,
after some unimportant evidence was
taken, adjourned till to-day at 11 a. m.
THE MAGIC FOOTLIGHTS
And the People Who Are Stand
ing in Front of Them the
Present Week.
Fun Galore and an Assorted Lot of
Attractions of Enough Kinds
to Please All.
"The Great Unknown" will continue at
the Columbia Theater as given by the
Frawley Company during the remainder
of the week. The long run of this play ,
and the continued attendance has attested
to its popularity. It is now announced
that the newplay,"The Social Trust," will
be put on next Monday evening. The
sale of tickets will begin to-day.
Chauncey Olcott is in his final week at
the California Theater, so that the oppor
tunities for hearing him sing, Irish songs
and ballads now remaining are few. "Love
Remains the Same," "The Minstrel Boy,"
"Roy Darling," "The Young fiose" and
other songs are sung nightly, incidental
to the production of "The Minstrel of
Clare."
"The Gay Parisians" is doing the ban
ner business of the season at the Baldwin
Theater. The comedy is certainly the
greatest laugh-provoker that has been
sent this way in many moons, and at no
time have we been favored with a more
clever comedy organization than which
in appearing in the piece nightly to
crowded houses at the Baldwin, where it j
will be seen for the remainder of this and j
next week.
In "Madame Sans Gene," Sardou's latest
European success, the humor of the play
consists in the transference of the Duchess
of Danzig's laundry manners to the new
imperial court, which Napoleon wishes to
make as dignified as possible. The scene
of the second and third acts is Napoleon's
library at Compeigne. A very amusing
quarrel in the imperial family is enacted.
Napoleon orders Mme. Sans Gene to get
divorced from her husband, as she is a dis
grace to the court. In the last act she re
trieves her position by proving to Napoleon
that the Comte de Neipperg, who has been
prowling about the court, has no intrigue
with the Empress. The ex-wasnerwoman
comes out triumphant. This production
comes to the Baldwin after "Tke Gay
Parisians."
The Orpneum continues to do a "land
office business" every evening, furnishing
a variety of attractions which are up to
the standard established at that house.
The list of people embraces Edward Favor
and Edith Sinclair, Sydney DeGray,
Mildred Howard, T. A. Kennedy, Biondi,
the four Nelson sisters and the vaudeville
combination.
Every evening this week "II Trovatore"
will be sung at the Tivoli. The attraction
is considered to be excellent, judging by
the audiences and the applause. The
favorite operatic work is well handled by
the soloists, chorus and orchestra, and the
ensemble is effective and pleasing. Next
week "La Traviata," "Cavalleria Rus
ticana" and the balcony and marriage
scene from "Romeo and Juliet," will be
given.
Crowds v itnesji nightly the performance
of "The En?::-'u" at Morosco's Grand
Opera-house. This is the last week at the
Grand of J#mes M. Bropby, who has a
star part in "The Ensign, I ' m which he
has played extensively throughout the
East during the past two years. Popular
prices, coupled with an attractive play,
makes a strong drawing card.
The Chutes are open every day from 1 to
11 p. M.. *iith performances every evening
and Saturday and Sunday matinees. Joe,
the ourang-outang, is there.
The concerts at the Sutro baths continue
every afternoon and evening. The baths
are open from 7 A. M. until 11 p. m.
Illegal Detention.
R. F. Mogan, administrator of the estate of
George J. Lawion, has sued George H. Joost
for alleged illegal detention of premises on
Jackson street, near Mason.
Suit on a Note.
J. J. Lerman has sued Fay & Shoaf for $5000
due on a promissory note drawn In ftvor of
Pauline C. Bui lard.

dition .
JANITORS ARE BLAMED.

Hospital.
OUT CLINIC TO BE ABOLISHED.
Contractor A. E. Buckman's GradiDg
Camp Again Comes Under In
vestigation.^
Inspector Patten ol the Health Depart- |
ment struck a popular strain yesterday ;
when he complained at the meeting of the
| board oi" the filthy condition of the corri
dors and stairways of the New City Hall
and incidentally demanded to know why
when $25,000 a year is paid for janitors
such a state of affairs exist.
The board, in the capacity of an echo, j
answered "why," and togetsomeinforma- i
tion on the subject ordered a copy of the i
communication sent to the Board of Su- ]
pervisors. Inspector Patten said that be '
j had not investigated the interiors of the '
j offices, but that he had paid some atten- ]
tion to the corridors and stairways and
that the janitors seemed to think that
merely throwing water on the floors and
sweeping it up was all that was necessary
for cleaning purposes.
He stated that dust, tobacco juice and j
other filth were so thicK on the railings
and stairs as to make them an eyesore as
well as a menace to the cleanliness of
linen and hands and that the corners of !
doorways were never cleaned out. He |
sugnested that the board take some meas- '
ures to have the hall cleaned thoroughly, I
at least occasionally.
Dr. Stahle, superintendent of the City
and County Hospital, in a communica- |
tion to the board, stated that in view of
the action of tne Board of Supervisors in
cutting down the annual appropriation
for ihe hospital from $80,000 to $75,000 it
will be necessary to abolish the out clinic
i and some of the wards, consolidate other
I wards and limit the number of patients to
be cared for at the institution to 300. The
matter was referred to the Hospital Com
mittee'and a copy of the communication
was ordered sent to the Board of Super
visors.
Secretary Godcliaux read a letter from
the Bureau of Animal Industry at Wash
ington stating that the local representa
tive of the bureau had reported that Miller
& Lux had defied his authority in relation
to two carcasses of cows that had been
found to contain traces of a disease that
brought them under the ban of the law.
The nrm had declared its intention of
doing as it pleased with the beef, the local
inspector having no power to order them
destroyed. The co-operation of the board
in the matter was asked.
The communication was placed on file,
it being known to the board that Meat In
spector Davis had taken possession of the
carcasses and had them removed to the
fertilizing works.
The Chinese Consul sent in a communi
cation stating that he had notified the
Chinese occupying the buildings recently
condemned by the board to vacate at
once and that he would be willing to use
every means to aid the board in cleansing
the Chinese quarter.
The matter of A. E. Buckman's grading
camp was taken up, a communication
from the German Savings Bank, owner of
the property on which the camp is located
being read. It stated that Buckman bad
been ordered to vacate by September 16.
Contractor Buckman also sent in a let
ter stating that it would cause him a ereat
loss of time and money to move his camp
at the present, but he had done everything
possible to get the camp into a sanitary
condition, and asking the board to recon
sider its action in condemning the place.
The matter was left to the discretion of
the Health Office.
At the request of the Health Officer a
resolution was passed asking the attorney
of the board to render an opinion on the
liability of tne street railroads to keep the
streets on which their tracks are laid in
repair, and as to their liability to repair
streets after tney have torn up their tracks.

Melons lower.
Provisions unchanged.
Coal offered very low.
CANNED AS *> DRIED FRUITS.
Business In Both Lines Is Inactive at
Kasy Prices.
The circular of the Cutting Packing Company
says of Canned and Dried Fruits:
CANNED FRUITSâ Apkicotsâ The season Is
' over and packers are figuring for an outlet for sur
plus standards and seconds. Pack is not over 60
per rent of an average. There is an opportunity,
flnallv, to clean up, if the distributive trade is at
alt ac ive Extras are already at a premium, and
a- Dried Aprico.s are very firm there is a good
fiuhtl chance for the long-suffering canned.
â¢ Peachesâ Frees arc- in much better supply than
anticipated, but the quality Is very poor. Choice sell
freely at good prices, but there is ft great surplus of
poor"quality at buyers' prices. Clings are of cx
cell-nt quality but scarce, and prices for extra
canning stock have advanced. Altogether the
packing of Frees ill be large and of poor quality,
while there will probably be a large pack of Clings,
a iarge portion of which will be extras.
Peaksâ is probably the largest crop ever
grown in the State, and the poorest ever known
as to quality: winds and hot weather have sup
plemented the work that was begun by over
-1 crowding and lack of thinning by the growers: re
ceipts are now at their height and there is a very
large pack, the largest for several years, of poor
standards and seconds; doubtless every contract
for extras will be filled short, as it is not possible
to procure any large proportion of good stock; we
look for buyers' prices for low grades.
Plumsâ lightest pack known for years:
crop is very short, but of good quality; prices of
canning stock are very high: most packers are too .
bus â¢ on peaches and pears to bother with them.
small Fruitsâ ln the dumps, but as there was
a very light oacfc, present stocks are not worrying
holders.
Tomatoesâ There is little change: there will be
un ample crop if present conditions prevail.
Business as a whole is at a standstill, especially
in the territory between the Rocky Mountains and
the Atlantic coast There is little hope of any
change for the better at present, except financial
centers lake hold and regulate the currency, ex
change and other conditions affecting manufactur
ing. The total lack of confidence has apparently
extended to caunera, and we look for a limited
output
1- xport demand seems to be large for a poor
itv or standards and an unusual portion of sec
onds. Several large parcels have already gone
forward, and we look lor the usual disastrous re
sults in foreign markets that we have experienced
in the domestic trade for years from their being
flooded with low-priced goods of doubtfu quality,
DRIED FRUITSâ There has been an almost
entire stagnation in business during the past three
weeks, due, no doubt, to the extreme heat prevail
ing throughout the i as;, as well as to the conserva
tive feeling of buyers. There has been some
speculative buying of apricots at 6 cents per
. po.ind 011 the part of local shippers. This buying
ha- now ceased, and the market is easy at the
same price, There have been but few if any
recent sales for account of Eastern jobbers.
Peach market opened at 4 Vie. and quickly de
clined to ;-(%c, with but few transactions at either
â  fitrure. The output will be considerably below
1 hat of last year. With cooler weather there will
doubtless be a demand that will ho.d the market
at Khou: present prices.
I'lirNKSâ Opening price of 3 1 .4 c attracted no at
tention; this price was followed by declines until
the 3c price was reached, at which ful.y 100 car
loads were sold. There are now but few offered at
3c. and an absence of much demand at that figure.
Raisiksâ There has been an active demand for
high grades; numerous sales of 4-crown were made
he li-Â±c, and subsequently equally large sales at
4c. Large orders for 3-crown have also been booked
at 3Vic, an 1 2-crown at 2%c. The ctod, besides
being considerably short of last year, will average
very poor In quality, a large percentage being 2
and 3 crown.

Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and - accomp by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
roast. Whrn the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north :iiid south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Or* Ron is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmei
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
ill produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO .UAUKEri.
CHICAGO, lix.. Aug. 19. âThe inclination
among local traders In wheat was to look for a
rally to-day and prices responsive to fair buying
displayed a better tone and advanced a little dur
ing the morning hoars. A number of purchasing
orders which appeared at the opening were for
foreign account and New York reported that there
was some of the same kind in that market This
indicating as it did a disposition on the part of
Europeans to take hold inspired the home trade
with greater confidence. Receipts at Chicago were
146 cars and 191,203 bushels were taken from
store. The Northwest had 346 cars against 206
last Wednesday and 218 a year ago.
Liverpool cables were steady. The posting of
export clearances of wheat and flour aggregated
680.929 bushels, and was the occasion of tempo
rary firmness, which disappeared upon the an
nouncement by Bradstreet's of a decrease in the
world's stocks of only 516,000 bushels. Closing
Paris cables were 20 to 35 centimes higher for
flour and unchanged for wheat. Antwerp was un
changed and Berlin 1% to 2 marks higher. Re
newed strength, which was ascribed to a better
New York stock market and to a heavy Importa
tion of gold, appeared in the last half-hour, the
best figures of the day being then established.
September wheat opened from 55i /e ctosf>@'>sVÃC-,
alvanced to %c, closing at (g>os%c, V:>c
over yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
116 cars. : . ' ;
CORNâ Business in corn was slow, as compared
with that of wheat and oats. It was a case where
both sellers and buyers lacked the necessary
nerve and confidence, and in consequence the mar
ket remained dull and listless, as to tone and di
rection they were regulated by the prevailing ten
dency of wheat â  Receipts were 697 cars, and
470,073 bushels were withdrawn from store.
Liverpool cables were firm. Bradstreets reported,
an increase of 1,427,000 bushels, Export clear
ances were 241,609 bushels. May corn opened l /!
263,4 c advanced to 2714 c, closing at 27JÂ£c bid at
(Â§,s/,c higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts
lor to-morrow 440 cars.
OATSâ A steady demand for oats existei all
through the session, the inquiry being principally
by shorts, who displayed no little uneasiness.

I COALâ a' local circular says: " Although It Is six
weeks sinee 1 the collieries recommenced work at
Newcastle, only five vessels' have been loaded for
this port, thus demonstrating it will yot take sev
eral months before the present | engaged list will
get their Coal cargoes. The delay is caused by tbe
intervention of steamers I and furnishing , the local
requirements. There are at present six vessels en
route from Newcastle with about 18,000 tons, and
four vessels from Sydney with about 10,000 tons.
This is all that can possibly I arrive here before the
commencement of . November, and --. as about . all
now afloat has been disposed pf, and the quantity,
is :â¢ not - excessive, present prices i should sustain
themselves within that time, -f Importers : are so
liciting to make contracts for loading at tbe lowest
prices ever , before known to - the trade. ! Colliery
owners are making concessions and vessels are so
licitous to get here, hence the delivery price here
Is cut - very = low. It Is ' a great advantage to our
manufacturers to secure low-cost fuel, but it Is a
hardship on our Coast Coal producers to meet with â 
such competition, where their output costs them so
highly for labor, etc., as against the prevailing
rates for hewing, etc., now existing In the Colo

THE STOOK MARKET.
The ComatockÃ were firmer on the afternoon
call, as will be seen by the sales, which, however,
did not increase in volume on account of the im
provement In values.
There was a rise in the Bodie stocks upon nÂ«ws
j of several strikes of ore In the Glldea and Fortuna
veins in the Bodie Con. and a general improve
ment in the Balwer Con.
The close was still firmer.
H. M. Gorham has been appointed superintend
ent of the Savase mine to flll the vacancy caused
by the death of R. P. Keating.
The Hutchinsou Sugar Plantation Company will
pay a monthly dividend of 26 cents per share
to-day.
About 1000 tons of ore from the Con. Cal. A. Va.
mine having accumulated Id the surface bins the
shipment of the same to the Morgan mill began j
Tuesday, and the mill began crushing yesterday.
This ore was extracted from the north part of the
mine, between the 1600 and 1650 levels, In and
around the old slopes.
In tbe Bodie Consolidated mine, on the 200
level, the long east crosscut was advanced nine
feet in rather heavier rock and stopped. North
drift from the same crosscut on a small seam near
the face was started and driven four feet with no
improvement. The raise through the Glldea old
stope is up twenty feet, showing sixteen Inches of
solid ore fn the top which promises to be of (,'ood
value. 350 levelâ Are preparing to work old fill
ings from the Fonnna vein just west of the shaft.
400 levelâ Fortuna vein raise in old fillings Is up
SO feet. The material In the top Is rather poor. :
550-iucline levelâ North drift from Fortuna winze |
was advanced 6 feet, the ore becoming somewhat !
better again, but very narrow and hard. Are work- I
ing under great disadvantages here and have I
stopped for the present.
In the Bulwer Consolidated mine on the 200 !
evel the stope above No. 2 south crosscut east has
been opened to the old ground toward the south.
Nos. 9 and 10 are now being driven, showing 5 or
6 inchei of ore. On the i unnel level in raise 1 the
quality of the ore is better, but the seam is small.
No. 2 raise shows a small seam of high grade ore.
East crosscut from south drift was driven 5 feet,
cutting a smali seam of $15 to $20 rock. An Inter
mediate drift from raise 1 was started from the
old slope and advanced 6 feet, showing 6 inches of
$50 rock. Extracted during the week a total of
14 2 tons of ore, assaying frm $15 to $82 per ton.

Sheep delight in the short grass and
peculiar herbage of hill pastures and bare
downs, and tlie mutton produced in such
pastures and by the breeds most suitable
to tnem is ol superior quality to that of
the lame, fat sheep fed on richer soil. The
multitude of tiny shells so often found on
every foot of down turf is also very effica
cious in fattening and nourishing the
animal.

favor to any party; but we are out for the
privilege of the franchise. The ladies in
other parts of the State ha?e complained
because I did not organize the campaign
earlier, but I think it is better to wait until
the public pulse is beating high, and then
more effective work can be accomplished.
We are, of course, very enthusiastic, and
we feel that we will have great influence
toward accomplishing needed reforms if
we win our fight. The rest of the State is,
pernaps, not working nearly co hard for
suffrage as Aiameda County.
"I inherit politics. I come of a political

but, of course, in her time it was very dif

The Berries Were Sour.
The Washington Post says that a Wash
ington phy.sician owns a cranberry bog at
Cape Cod. Two or three years ago he en
tertained an Enelisn cousin, and at din
ner one night there was cranberry sauce.
The Englishman was delighted with it.
Indeed, he expressed bis pleasure 1 so much
and so often that after he had returned to
London the doctor sent him over a barrel
of fine Cape Cod cranberries. A month
or so passed and then came a letter from
the Englishman. "My Dear So-and-So,"
it uaid, "it was awfully good of you to
semi me those berries, and I thank you.
Unfortunately, they all soured on the way
over."

A BURGLAR SHOT AT.
Speedy Capture Made After a
Chase This Morning by
Two Officers.
The Superintendent of Schools and the
Board ot Education Disagree.
One Cent Pieces.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 19.â A Dane
named Hans Hansen, intent on burglary,
started at 5 o'clock this morning to go
through the jeans of six laundry China
men living in a tenement at the corner of
Bank alley and Oak street, and almost op
posite the police station. He awoke one
of the celestials, who made an outcry, and
the boss Chinaman, Sine Lee, fired a re
volver at him. Officers Brampton and
Moebus gave chase to the robber down
Bang alley, across Park street and into
Webb avenue. Another shot after him
only increased his speed. The fire brigade
boys headed off his flight, so he broke to the
left through two vacant lots, scaling a six
foot fence, and got on to Lincoln avenue.
He then doubled back toward Park street
and ran into an alleyway alongside of Ger
mania Hall. The officers after a search
found him concealed in the gutter of two
low roofs at the rear of another Chinese
laundry.
Unanimity Broken.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aur. 19.â The first
sign of friction in the doings of the Board
of Education was exhibited last night,
when the School Superintendent read out
the timetable of the principals' duties.
Hitherto everything has been smooth
sailing, the board doing all the discussion
and arranging before the meetings.
The Superintendent's timetable as ar
ranged last night showed that the princi
pals bad chosen special subjects to teach
and would be held accountable for the
results. This, he contended, was in ac
cordance with the new rule. The mem
bers, on the contrary, held the opposite
view, and all took a general band in the
discussion against the Superintendent,
who stoutly maintained his ground. Chair
man Tisdale at last suggested that the rule
be referred to the Committee on Rules and
Regulations, and it was so decided.
A Racial Difficulty.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 19â Shall Chi
nese and Japanese children be allowed the
right of attending the public schools is an
other question that the Board of Educa
tion is wrestling with.
"I do not think these Japs have any
right to come here and have the benefits
of our schools without paying for them,"
said Director Brown. "We complain that
our classrooms are crowded, and that there
is no room for children whose parents are
actual residents. Nearly all of these
Japanese pupils may be classed as non
residents and many of them are over
school age."
Chairman Tisdale said it was a fact that
there are a great many Japanese attend
ing our schools, to which he is heartily
opposed when they are not residents.
â¢'A few days ago a Chinaman called on
me and asked whether he might attend
our schools. I told him he had better go
to school in China, where he came from.
The Chinaman stated that he failed to see
why any distinction should be made be
tween his race and the Japanese."
The matter is to receive attention at the
board's next meeting.
The 1-Cent Piece.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 19.â G. A. Blank,
a confectioner living here, has a hobby.
The South Pacific objected to his exercise
of it and he has a suit pending against the
company. His hobby consists in tender
ing lucent pieces or copper pennies as rail
road and car fare.
The other day he tendered five pennies
to the conductor on the local electric line,
who exclaimed: "This is the second time
you've sprung this on me. I'm not going
to turn such trash in to the company."
He rang the fare up and threw the pennies
on to the street. Mr. Blank says every
time he rides on the cars in future he is
going to find that conductor and make
him throw the pennies away or adopt the
penny idea.
The Settling Up.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 19.â Alameda
day committee held a meeting last night
to estimate expenses in connection with
the celebration at the Oakland Exposition.
Liabilities were stated ito be $79, receipts
I $68, leaving an indebtedness of $11, which
is to be met among the members of the

TO DO AS THEY PLEASE
Freshmen, Conscious of Their
Strength, Defy the
Sophomores, i
They Will Refuse to Recognize the
Supremacy of the Second
Year Men.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 19.â The new
freshmen of the university have made a
threat that opens out a prospect of the
biggest year of rushing that was ever ex
perienced at Berkeley.
Flushed by their successes in the small
preliminary contests that have so far
taken place the '00 men declare that they
can do what they please in college thifl
year and will not acknowledge, e7en par
tially, the sophomore rule that has laid
down the customs for freshmen of the
past. The class of '00 is a large and strong
one, adding 250 "soldiers" to the Univer
sity Cadets, and it is believed to be the
most powerful "rushing" class that ever
entered the university.
But if the freshmen should decide to
carry canes they would be introducing an
innovation which would sorely trample
upon the dignity of the sophomores.
The latter declare that they will never
allow the "men of nit," as '00 stu
dents are called, to carry canes during
their first year at college. They will way
lay all freshmen with walking-sticks and
take away the disputed sign of advanced
coilege standing, and if the freshmen
should unite in carrying out their now
whispered threat to carry canes it is safe
to say that a large number of the latter
will be broken before the year ends, and
there will be a long succession of rushes
before the point is settled.
The freshmen will hold their first class
meeting next Friday in Stiles Hall. They
will organize -and elect officers and.it is
expected, issue a challenge for the sopho
more class to meet them in a rush.

CAKEWALKS ARE
SCIENTIFIC SHOWS,
Champion Milton Johnson
Repents the Use of a
Word.
DEFENDER OF HIS ART.
Denies That He Is Not the Peer
in Society of Any Colored
Citizen.
IS PBOUD OF HIS PARTNER.
If Thera Were More People Prac
ticing Cakewa'king There Would
Be Less Waddling.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,^
908 Broad>ay, Aug. 19. )
Colored society is considerably stirred
up over the subject of cake walks. There
will be another before long and already a
personal combat is being waged.
Milton Johnson, tne champion cake
walker of tne coast, is very sorry for his
little outburst of bad oratory at the expo
sition two nights ago and now he wishes
he had not done it. It was all the fault of
his memory. He wanted to use the word
"paltry," but it would not come to him
and he said something else.
"All that trouble was caused by one
single word," said Champion Johnson to
day. "I was feeling so badly over the deci
sion of the judges at the Macdonough two
weeks aÂ»o that I feit I ought to say some
thing. I intended to say that they sold
their principle for a few paltry dimes, but
I said â well, something else about the
nature of the dimes, and people turned
their heads.
"Now about cafcewalking. It is a fine
art ana tnere is considerable science in
it. There is certainly nothing demoral
izing about it, and I dispute the word of
everybody who speaks disparagingly of it.
If everybody would attempt to walk as
poetically ana gracefully as a good cake
walker does there would be a big im
provement in the general appearance of
the majority of people.
"The lady with whom I am at present
walking is Miss Jennie la Curtiss, who has
had very little experience so far, but who
is improving wonderfully. I hay* several
elegant scientific movements in reserve,
and when Miss ia Curtiss has practiced
some more we will surprise people. She is
doing very well at her lessons.
"VVher*vor I have walked I have always
taken first prize except at the Macdon
ough, and I consider I am quite as respec
table and useful a member of society as
any of those who are talking about me.
If some people that I know would talk
less and play less poker they would be
more respcted. Whatever I win at a
Cakewalk I use for the benefit of my fam
ily, and they get the use of all my wages,
and I want everybody to understand that
1 am just as respectable a colored citizen
as there is in the county and I am proud
of it."
When not engaged in cakewalkine Mil
ton Johnson works as a barber on Wash
ington street.
Misquoting Scripture.
The Watchman of Boston says that
some of the prominent managers of the
International Sunday-school Convention,
which met in Boston the other day, failed
to auote the Bible correctly, though tney
advanced the most extreme theories of
verbal inspiration. Among those who, it
says, misquoted the Bible, were the Rev.
Dr. David J. Burrell of this city, the Rev.
Dr. Tyler, a member of the lesson com
mittee, and B. F. Jacobs, a member of the
same committee. The Sunday-school
also tells of a member of the lesson com
mittee who quoted the declaration, "All
that a man hath will he give for his life,"
as a Scriptural statement of truth, whereas
it was uttered by Satan, and is simply
quoted in the Bible. The Watchman men
tions these incidents to show that there is
a widespread ignorance of the Bible, even
among Christian preachers and teachers.

sulphides, which is regarded as a most un
usual occurrence, but similar conditions
exist in other Bingham mines.
Two mills are running regularly at
Quartz Mountain and the town is on the
boom. At the App mine ten more stamps
will be added to the twenty already run
nine and the same will be done at the
Dutch mine.â Angels Voice.
Miss Jennie Hilton, formerly a school
teacher in the Pomona Valley, California,
turned prospector and took to the moun
tains in genuine prospecting style. For
the past year she has been engaged in
mining enterprises, together witu her
brother and uncle, near Harquahala, Ariz.,
and a few weeks ago she sold her interest
in the Kansas mine in that district for
$35,000, of which amount she received
$20,000 in cash, the balance to be paid in
sixty days.
Quigley, Mont., is getting quite a boom.
The principal mine is the Jumbo, which is
claimed to be the greatest gold proposition
on the continent. The lead is 236 feet in
width and carries an average value of $5
to $25 per ton. They employ 450 men, the
payroll being $50,000 per month. Miners
get $3 50 per day and laborers $3. So says
the Rock Creek* Record.
A big strike of free gold has been made
in the Little Giant, situated in the Pierre
Lake camp, which surpasses anything yet
developed in the reservation country. The
yellow metal exists in a well-defined vein
of ledge matter about two feet or mo:e in
width, and is free milling. Tbis discovery
is near the big copper lead, and practically
settles the question for a brilliant future
to the Pierre Lake country, which is only
twenty-two miles irom Marcus. Speci
mens weighing fifty pounds, taken from a
depth of twenty-four feet, will assay $20,
--000 to the ton. â Mining Industry.
"Very little quartz mining has been done
In Eastern Oregon, but that little has pro
duced wonders. Wherever a reasonable
sum of money has been expended in de
velopment and machinery the yield of
gold has been enormous. For instance,
look at the Virtue mine with a twenty
stamp mill producing nearly $40,000
monthly; the Bonanza, the E. & E. mines,
the Cornucopia and many others produc
ing from $10,000 to $30,000 per month. Yet
with this magnificent showing the district
is comparatively unknown to the cutside
world. In Chicago I have been asked,
'Does Oregon produce gold? We didn't
know it was a mining State.' This district
wilj be second to none when known." â
Mining Industry.
About fifteen miles from Alamos, So
nora, a very rich mine has been discov
ered, with copper ore, some of which
yields 30 per cent copper and which also
shows an admixture of gold. A company
has been formed to work it.
One day the widow of a deceased Judge
in the State of Utah began an inventory
of the pockets that bad been left, by the
lamented, and in them found 40,000 shares
of stock in the famous Portland mine at
Cripple Creek, 1 which bss already paid
$745,000 to its stockholders, of which sum
$120,000 has been paid the present year.
At the present market value of Portland,
with dividends being repeated each
month, the lady should never know such
a thing as want. That wa3 a pretty rich
pocket of ore for the poor widow.
There are no statisticts to prove the
aggregate wives have bagged by indus
trious searches of husbands' pockets, but
we doubt if ttiere has ever been an in
stance of such a find. It is to be hoped
that the above piece of good luck will not
give an impetus of tbis industry in the
hope of a similar one.
A Port Townsend paper says it has
been found that the richest placer mines
of the north, on Glacier and Miller creeks,
heretofore supposed to be upon Alaskan
territory, and therefore within the United
States, are inside the boundaries of British
Columbia, and they are therefore subject
to tax by the Dominion Government.
The old Pittsburg mine on Gold Flat is
again comine to the front. A gentleman
informed a Union reporter last night that
the mine is looking very favorable indeed,
a ledge of high-grade ore having been
struck in the 600-foot level. The mine is
being worked by tributers, who have been
making wages for some time past.
The Nevada Transcript says splendid
quartz has been struck in the Summit
mine, and the prospects are very encour
aging. If the developments continue as
tuey have of late it will not be a great
while before the company will find it
necessary to put up a mill. Superintend
ent Nihell is to be congratulated upon the
success that is attending his management
of the mine.
According to an article in the RepublK
can the Golden Ajax mine (Colorado) is a
bonanza. They clam to have a vein 150
to 200 feet wide, which runs from $8 to $45
in gold per ton.
The Colorado Mining Exchange has ex
pelled several members for violation of
the rules.
A clean-up of eight loads of ore from the
I Indiana mine has just been completed at
the Electric mill. The mine is located on
almost the top of Osborn Hill and is
owned by Michael White and sons. The
ledge is a good-sized one and is in a re
gion famous for rich quartz veins. The
result of the crushing is not made public,
but it was more than satisfactory to the
owners.â Grass Valley Telegraph.
Sit down on all booms. If big strikes
are made and paying mines are opened
there will be no trouble in disposing of
them to men of wealth. Money will de
velop the camp and its inhabitants, not
th* rabble who follow a boom, will reap
the benefits.â Alaska Mining Record.
The above advice is very sensible, but is
not Alaska mining at the present moment
no small proportion of its prosperity from
its "boom" in its mines? What else has
| sent the hundreds of miners to the coun
try and created business in the com
| munity? The mining papers there have
done their share in promoting the boom,

and are responsible for a good deal of the
suffering that has followed the rush of the
ever improvident miner to the country to
be disappointed in their expectations.
At a meeting of the directors of the Iron
Mountain mine at Helena, Mont., it was
decided to run a tunnel 5600 feet in length,
to tap the mine at a depth of 1600 feet.
The worK will require one year's time, and
cost $70,000.
A company with a capital of $2,250,000
has been formed in New Zealand to work
the iron sands of the beach near New
Plymouth.
During a storm in Chihuahua, Mexico,
recently, an enormous meteor fell from
the sky, striking the side of a mountain,
bringing down a large mass of the cliff,
burying itself in the ground, destroying
the house of a miner and killing two chil
dren. The steam is still issuing from the
hole.
Professor Blake recently wrote and de
livered a lecture on meteors at Tucson,
Arizona, since which meteors have been
falling all over Arizona and Mexico,
more having fallen within the last six
months than for years previous. The
professor's lecture seems to have aroused a
spirit of rivalry among the meteors to
come to the front and be noticed. We
earnestly beg the professor to hold up, or
we shall have meteors falling all around
us, and possibly get one on top of our
heads. We have had all sorts of calami
ties already, and draw the line at meteors.
Owing to the fall in the price of copper
the mines of Lake Superior and Lake
Michigan have rushed the shipments of
the metal this last year, exceerling the
shipments of last year by 5,000,000 tons.
Ail the copper mines are reducing forces
and in every possible way economizing,
and the bis mines are practically closing,
throwing 3000 men out of employment.
Another quartz mill is being erected in
the vicinity of the Tubbs mine in Placer
Connty. The remarkable success of the
latter property has attracted considerable
attention to the quartz ledges of the vicin
ity.
The Bald mine, the property of Fred
Brunner St., has been bonded to William
Cleary, formerly of the Sheep Ranch
mine, for $25,000.
The work of erecting machinery on the
Carley gold quartz mine, situated in Alta
viile mining district, is going on actively.
As soon as the machinery is all in position
the work of developing the mine will be
commenced. Thi.s promises to be a valu
able mining property.
It was reported during the week that a
large block of gold, estimated to weigh
about 1500 pounds and of the value of
$295,643 73, was found in the last crosscut
of No. 10 tunnel of the DeLamar, and was
imbedded in a rock of somewhat different
character and hardness known to mining
men. They are trying to get it out whole,
and dare not blast on that accouut. Hard
ened chisels, tempered with machine oil
make but little impression on the rock,
but it is the only tool that any Headway
can be made with. â DeLamar (Nev.) Lode.
Mr. Brown of Tulare has struck $45 ore
near Summit station, four miles east of
Goler, in the Randsburg district.
News comes from the Panamint coun
tty. over in Inyo County, fifty miles
northeast of Randsburg, that George
Cruise, Bady Creamer and Bob Avery
have struck a ledge that will run from $15
to $90 a ton.
P. Frefield, who has been looking for
a mine ever since last November, has dis
covered a paying claim within two miles
of Randsburg! It will go $80 to the ton.â
Californian.
The Needles Gazette says: James Mc-
Clintock, who has been working a dry
washer in the Chemehuevis Mountains,
arrived in Franconia a few days ago with
a $32 nueget an many others that weighed
from $2 to $6 each. Besides these he had
with him a nice little sack of gold dust.
If a stranger visits your camp looking
for investment don't frighten capital away
by asking a dozen prizes. â Exchange.
This paragraph affords a text from which
a sermon might be preached to the benefit
of the mine-owner, if they would read,
learn and digest it, which they won't,
nevertheless we will give them a little
piece of advice, which is, do not get the
"big head" and imagine because some
mines have been sola at prices much
higher than would have been taken for
them a year ago, you can get four times
as much now. It holds to reason that
when an article is dull of sale it can be
bought cheaper than when in better de
mand.
A reasonable advance is all right, but
when as an instance within our know
ledge, where a man owning a group of un
developed mines would have been ?lad to
have had an offer of $20,000 and would
have taken it quickly a year ago, has
raised his price to $150,000, it is absurd
no doubt but what be could sell for double
the value of twelve months ago, but what
folly to raise to $150,000! It simply
scares away honest seekers for min
ing property, it being a great mistake
on the part of the mine owner to sup
pose that a competent mining expert
is not a very good judge of the value of a
property, and is not at all influenced in
his estimate of it by the price asked, when
he comes to examine it, and will advocate
its purchase at such a fancy price. It
must be remembered that there are mines
and mines for sale in the State, and no one
owner has the monopoly of the business,
hence we quote the language of the text
and don't inghten investors away by ask
ing ridiculous prices for your properties.

ONCE WERE POOH
BUT NOW ARE RICH
Rejoicing Among the Mar
guerite Mine Stock
holders.
MINING MEN EXCITED.
Placer County's Wealth of Gold
Ore Believed to Be
Fabulous.
TEE OLDEST AND YOUNGEST.
How the Shareholders Received the
News of Their Good Luckâ Their
Future Plans
The remarkable discovery of gold in the
Marguerite mine near Auburn, Placer
County, as published in yesterday's Call,
caused great excitement amonc the min
ing men, not only in this City, but
wherever the news was spread by the pa
per.
Hundreds remarked that they knew sold
would be struck in great quantities in that
section. Among these was J. A. Filcher,
manager of the State Board of Trade,
whose home is in Auburn. "I have
known for years," aaid be, "that there
would be a big strike in Placer County one
of these days.
"The county is marked in all directions
by rich quartz ledges and those who have
stayed right by the business have made
lots of money. The trouble with the
majority is that they have done too much
'coyote mining.' That is, they would dig
for a short time in a place, get out fair ore,
have it milled and with the proceeds go
out and root around and find another vein.
These coyote holes are all over the county
and there is no doubt that dozens of them,
if mined properly, would yield good re
turns.
"As for the Marguerite mine, lam fa
miliar with every foot of the ground. I
am glad that this rich find has been made,
for it will induce a more systematic plan
of mining in that section in the future.
There is more gold in Placer County's hills
than has ever been taken out by pick or
pan."
Mr. Filcher's belief is shared by all who
have any knowledge of the county's re
sources, and particularly by those who are
so fortunate as to hold stock in the rich
Marguerite mine. These shareholders are
about 100 in number, and they are scat
tered all the way from the Golden Gate to
New York.
The principal holders are Directors
George Schafer, F. M. Freund, H. Helfrich;
H. Gumbel, the treasurer; Charles Peach,
the secretary; George Schmitt, ex-presi
dent; Charles Winters, the ex-secretary;
G. Gall and Charles Lotz, vice-presidents;
Max Schwab, G. Schafer, J. Engi^h,
C,hailes Martin, A. Wirtner, Fred A. Brit
ten, C. Reittig, J. Winkler, H. Mettmann,
G. Britten, Gus Ungermann.
As stated in The Call the strike was
made last Friday and the majority of the
stockholders went to bed Thursday night

and woke up to find themselves wealthy
on tbe following day. Many never knew
what it was before to have a dollar not
earned by hard work, and it is safe to say
that they scarcely realize their position in
the community. While among them there
is a feeling- of exhilaration and rejoicing,
and to a certain extent suppressed excite
ment, still all preserve a quiet demeanor,
and they receive the congratulations of

their friends with pleasure. None have
yet had time to become haughty.
At 427 Hayes street there was a small
gathering of stockholders last evening.
This is the little pork store owned by
Charles Peach, the secretary of the com
pany, and the promoter of the enterprise.
Ccarles Peach, retailer of pork, sausages
and such delicacies, did not present the
least appearance of a wealthy mine owner.
He still wore his snow-white apron, soft
shirt and skull cap, and he was as willing
as ever to weigh out 10 cents' worth of
leaf lard to a customer. In this there was
a moral â wealth has not spoiled him.
Near by was his wife beaming with the
happy thoughts that went through her
mind. "We will stay by the pork store,"
said she with a laugh, "until the mine
begins to make returns, then the sausages
may go to the dogs."
Cleaning the counters and waiting upon
customers was another whom no one
would suspect of being wealthy. He was
Charles Martin, one of Peach's employes.
Martin, too, carries a neat little bit of
Marguerite stock in his inside pocset.

Who Is Now a Rich Man.
"I have scratched a poor man's head for
many years," he remarked, "and now I
do not propose to lose that head. I don't
expect that I will get enough to spoil
me."
G. Britten, the youngest stockholder in
the company, is another who does not in
tend to go wild with the acquisition of
wealth. He is only 18 years of age and is
attending the San Francisco Business
College. His little bunch of stock will
assist him to secure a most thorough edu
cation, which has been the aim of his life.
So far the young man has bad to mind
his p's and q's in order to advance as far
as he has on the oath of knowledge. He
blesses the day be put his small savings
into Marguerite mining stock. His
brother, Fred A. Britten, now in the East,
also has a slice of the same source of
wealth.
The little party listened with interest to
Peach, who told the story of the recent
history of the mine, a story they knew by
heart, but still loved to hear. Peach had
been in the mining business before and
once owned an interest in the well-known
Spenceville copper mine, in Nevada
County. He now owns a small mine, also
in that county. During the Midwinter
Fair he met Professor G. F. Deetken, the
owner of the Marguerite, then called the
Saizac.
Deetkin wanted to sell, and Peach at
once went to Auburn to inspect the mine.
He found it filled with water to within
forty feet of the surface. He went down
the shaft and his inspection of the ledge
of quartz showed him that it was a good
property. At forty feet he found excel
lent pay ore, and in a short time the com
gany he formed purchased the Balzac and
the improvements for $30,000.
The next move was to purchase five
acres of adjoining land so as to be able to
run a tunnel for ventilation and explora
tion of the five well denned veins that
showed on the surface. The sinkine!ofthe
shaft, the 450-foot drift, that cost $20,000
was mentioned in yesterday's Call, but
the tale was listened to with interest.
;â  It was the description of the ledge of
rotten quartz, rich with sparkling cold
that interested them the most, and from
all accounts it contains untold wealth, for
it is known to extend from the surface 300
feet into the earth.
Peach says that there is now over 3000
tons of nrst-class ore piled on the surface
taat has been taken from various parts of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 1896.
the two shafts and the connecting drift.
The first move will be to put up a small
mill and go to work extracting the gold
from the quartz. In time a larger mill
will be erected. He said: "We will have
but little trouble to work our ore. The
mine is close to the railroad station and
the annoyance of long-distance hauls is
thereby avoided."
In contrast with young Britten, who is
so favorably beginning his life, there is
another stockholder wjio has seen his
best days. F. M. Freund of 1135 Shotwell
street is now 70 years of age. It was the
ambition of his life to ba wealthy some
day. In his old age that day has come.
The dream of his life has been realized.
One of the largest stockholders in the
company is George Schafer, a capitalist.
He holds 3000 of the 50,000 shares. Yester
day, after the news of the strike was pub
lished in this paper, Mr. Schafer was
offered $20 a share for all he had. Al
though the par value is $10, he laughed at
the offer and said that he would rather
buy than sell stock, Mr. Schafer has re
sided twenty-two years in San Francisco.
He lives at 14 Shotwell street, is married
and has an interesting family.
Good luck has been known to cure sick
ness. Here is a chance for the remedy to
be .fried. Charles Winters, the former
secretary, is lying ill with typhoid fever
in his home on Sanchez street. His friends
believe that the news of the strike will
bring him out in a very short time.
One of those most excited by his good
fortune is Charles Lotz, who conducts a
bakery down at 344 Sixth street. When
told of the strike he is said to have ex
claimed, "Well, for once my cake is not all
dough."
G. Gall, the proprietor of a large coffee
saloon under the Pioneer building, on
Fourth street, came in for bis share of the
great, but as yet unknown, riches. He is
not sorry that he went into the company
two years ago. Neither are any other of
the stockholders, although at times in the
past they wondered when the tide would
turn and money come in from the mine.
They will not have long to wait.
[ James Everard, the Millionaire Brewer
of New York City,
Has revolutionized the Beer and Ale industries
of the United States from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. Mr. Everard's 'Alf and 'Alf is half ale
and half old English Stout, put up in one bot

maker aud the best tonic In the world. James
Everard's pure Canada malt lager beer is dif

When we say pure we mean unadulterated;
that is, pure Caiiadian malt and hops properly
brewed and aged belore being placed on the
market.
Messrs. Goldberg, Bowen & Co. of this City
have secured the distributing agency for the
Pacific Coast and ordered five carloads, which
part of the same is being delivered.
We invite the public to test our 'Alf and 'Alf

Fred Dingle's Downfall.
The case of Fred H. Dingle, the assistant sec
retary of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, who was accused of embezzle
ment, came up before Police Judge Joachim
son yesterday and was continued for a week.
Dingle is accused of appropriating about $700
of tue association's funds to his own use. Ex
pert Accountant Peterson, who discovered the
shortage, filed a complaint charging the young
mail with having embezzled $100. Dingle's
bonds were set at $ 1000. It is stated that Din
gle's downfall was caused by his association

young lady.

SENATOR FAIR'S LETTERS
Charles Refused to Produce
Them Without a Compel
ling Order.
The Taking of the Deposition Ad
journed Until Judge Slack Says
They Are Material.
Charles L. Fair came before the notary
yesterday morning according to the terms
of the adjournment of his deposition, but
he did not have the letters with him that
he was expected to bring. The letters
were some that had been written him in
1894 by Senator Fair, and upon which the
lawyers based their belitf in the pencil
will when Charles himself swore by that
document. The handwriting itself was
convincing.
Mr. Del mas had called for the produc
tion of the letters under the subpena or
order of court requiring the witness to
bring all papers touching the matter at
issue.
The witness, in answer to the question,
said he did not have the letters.
Mr. Heggerty, his counsel, explained
that after consultation it had been decided
not to produce these letters until the
court had decided tnat they were material
and relevant to the issue.
"Why have you not produced these let
ters? " inquired Mr. Delmas of the witness.
"We object to the question as calling
for the conclusion of the witness," said
Mr. Heggerty. The witness refused to
answer under advice of his counsel.
Mr. Delmas said there was nothing
further to be done then but to go to court
and set an order requiring the production
ot the papers. An adjournment was there
fore taken.
