Governor Altgeld the Boss at Chicago,

Bland.

Chicago, m. ( June SO. >
The first ripple on the political wave
was observed here to-day when the Bi
metallic I<eagne and the Illinois delega
tion held meetings in the Sherman House
and took steps for the protection of
silver* interests in the convention.
Governor Altgeld uÂ»s the principal
figure there and hii advice was that
Illinois and the silverpeople should take
the reins and drive the convention their
own way.
It was decided not to allow the National
Committee to unseat any silver men or
fill their placet with friends of gold.
Bland is gaining strength in the lead,
while the Teller bnom is getting out of
wind. If it should be necessary to re
acind the rule requiring a two-thirds
vote of the convention to nominate a
President it will be done. The friends
of free coinage have the convention in
the hollow of their hands and they
can do with it as they wish.
Governor Altgeld .if Illinois is the
man of the hour. He has now the mar
shaling of the bimetallic forces and In
tends to be the fl or manager of the
whole affair.
The gold men will hm sat down upon
,yrj hard. There . â  ..r-".iiÂ»r hopi. nor

SILVER CRUSADERS RALLY.
From All Sections of the Union
the Leaders Are Marching:
Upon Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â The silver
crusaders are marching on Chicago. . The
advance guard reached the city early this
morning and established headquarters ai
the Sherman House, where the scene
during the day was one of great activity.
It was the annual gathering of the Demo
cratic Bimetallic National Committee.
There were present silver leaders from ail
parts of the country- They came from
the North, South, East and West, all sur
charged with bimetallic doctrine.
Governor Stone headed the Missouri
delegation. He is a tall, active Missourian
and is championing the cause of Bland
for the Presidential nomination.
Senator Jones of Arkansas was on the
ground early. So was Senator Harris of
Tennessee.
Governor Stone chatted pleasantly about
the political situation. He said the Dem
ocrats in his State had yon a great victory
for the party in declaring for silver, and
he thought if the National Democracy
would adopt a like platform and set Bland
upon it they would sweep the country.
â¢'We want a platform," said the Gov
ernor, "that will clearly and absolutely
declare for free silver coinage of both gold
and silver at a ratio of 16 to 1. Such a
platform will satisfy the Democrats of
Missouri. They ask nothing more, they
will accept nothing less. Mr. Bland is tbe
most conspicuous candidate for the Presi
dential nomination at this time. Ido not
sar that we will succeed in nominating
.-, but we will do all we can to accom
plish that end."
Senatoi Dubois of Idaho arrived here
last night to freshen up the Teller bomb,
which seems to have petered out, though
Lee Mantle of Montana has been in town
for the last week looking after the candi
dacy of the Colorado statesman, whose in
tention is to place the name of Teller be
fore the convention if a delegate can be
found who will Dominate him. Teller,
however, was not mentioned at the meet
ing of the Bimetallic Le agne to-day. That
1p an indication that he :8: 8 not looked upon
with much favor by tbe Democracy# On
the other hand, the merits of Bland and
Boies were generally dossed They are
v the leaders in the race at this time
A brief session of the bin. etallic commit .
tee was held during the morni d ,
(L was decided to take a firm Btand on th<s
question of temporary orgtnization The
sentiment of tbe committee Was for ha
mony, but if Chairman Harrity should
appoint as temporary presiding officer of
Pf the convention a delegate unfriendly to
."the gilver interest the members of the
league, the great majority of whom are
fc delegates to the convention, will unhesi
ftatingly spring a silver man for the posi
ftion. A committee consisting of Senator
? Jones, Governor Stone, Senator Turpie,
I Governor Altgeld and Senator Daniels
was appointed to confer with the Execu
tive National Committee relative to the
chairmanship.
It will be readily seen that this commit
tee,-As composed of men of on" purpose,
arid that is to direct the thought and ac-
Jwon of the convention. They are de
jttermined that the platform shall contain
la declaration for the unlimited coinage of
fcilvf r at a ratio of 16 to 1.
f Senator Hill ol New York would be ac
ceptable to many of the silver men as
temporary chairman of the convention.
Kle is probably the only goid man whom j
The San Francisco Call
UNCLE SAM-" IT'S NO USE, GENTLEMEN. SHE WON'T LIVE TO TAKE EITHER?^
tbe white metal adherents would accept.
Even Governor Altgeld said to-day that
while be did not want to discuss person
alities, Hill would in a measure be accept
able.
"If the National Committee attempts to
force on the convention a Democrat who
is antagonistic to silver," said Governor
Altgeld in disenssing the situation with
me to-day, "the delegates will simply take
tbe matter in their own hands. It is tbe
privilege of the National Committee to
recommend a temporary chairman. It is
not its duty to force any particular man
upon us. While the silver men will nave
control of the convention, we would be
willing to accept a man for chairman who
has not taken an active interest in check
ing this wave of popular sentiment that is
now sweeping over the country. But we
hope that the National Committee will
appreciate the fact that silver men will
have more than a two-thirds majority and
therefore should have a voice in the selec
tion of a chairman.
"As regards the two-third rale," contin
ued Governor Altgeld, "we propose to
have it expunged from the rules of the
convention. It worked its way into the
regulations of the party through the efforts
of schemers and plotter?, and is absolutely
foreign to Democratic discipline and doc
trine. Why, in the convention of 1860 it
was the cause of all the trouble. Douglas
had a majority of the votes, but he failed
to get two-thirds of the majority and there
was a split in the convention, and history
tells the story of a party almost ruined.
Now the Illinois delegation proposes to
fight the two-third rule from this hour.
That action was decided upon at a meet
ing to-day. We want the wishes of the
people free from all hamperings, so that
wnen the issue goes out before the country

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JULY 1, 1896.
WHO THREW THAT BRICK?
A Conundrum That Caused a Hot
Fight Between Strikers
and Policemen.
Fifty Union Men Bad y Clubbed and
Sent to the Hospita at Cleve
land, O:iio.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 30.â The big
gest row which has yet occurred at the
Brown Hoisting Works took place this
afternoon, when the men quit work. The
non-strikers, who are also non-unionists,
marched out as under police protection to
the streetcars. When the cars came along
they refused to stop, although commanded
to do so by the police, the motormen being
presumably in collusion witn the strikers.
Meantime a mob o'. at least 5000 men
were surging all around the band of police
who were guarding the workmen. When
it became evident that the streetcars
would not stop it was determined to march
to the Fourth Precinct for safety. A start
was made in that direction, the mob grow
ing more noisy and violent every moment.
Finally the police could stand it no
longer. Drawing their clubs, they charged,
scattering the strikers right and left and
knocking them down by the dozen.
Twenty men were seriously injured and
taken to the hospitals, while many others
received scalp wounds and bruises. Fully
fifty people were injured by the police.
All the ambulances and all the available
police force of the city were called to the
scene.
The immediate cause of the charge was
a brick thrown by a striker, which bit
Officer Siddeil on the head. The police
made a second charge, chasing tiie strikers
across lots and hitting everybody in signt,
and the tight was over for the day, but
threats oi vengeance are made, and the
police are preparing for a big fight to
morrow.
INFORMATED POLES.
Raid the Beres tttoni Quarries and Defy
the Authorities.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, June 30.â The em
ployes of the Cleveland Stone Company,
who have been on strike at Beres since
June 11, made a raid on the quarries there
this afternoon and drove out some twenty
men who were at work. The men took
refuge in a blacksmith shop and were res
cued with difficulty from the mob of 300
infuriated Poles. Mayor Cnristian tried
to persuade the strikers to disperse, and
failing, sent to thiÃ city for Sheriff Leek,
who, with fifty deputies, hurried to the
scene.
President Wortbington asserts to-night
that the men will return to work to-mor
row despite the strikers, and the strikers
say they shall not. A meeting was held
in the Polish schoolhouse, to which none
but strikers were admitted, and so critical
has the situation become to-night, with
officers and strikers patrolling the streets
of Beres, that the Mayor will probably
ask for troops if there is further trouble in
the morning.
GERMAN ARSENAL ON FIRE
People in the Neighborhood Are
Fleeing for Their
Lives.
Troops Fighting the Flames, With
Only Seven Men Killed at Last
Accounts.
BERLIN, Germany, June 30.â An arse
nal near Fort Mosel, one of the forts in the
vicinity of Metz, the capital of Lorraine,
was discovered to be on fire to-night. The
discovery caused consternation among the
people in tbe neighborhood for the reason
that there is an immense amount of ex
plosives in the arsenal. The garrison
troops were hurriedly turned out to fight
the flames and prevent, if possible, an ex
plosion, which, should it occur, would be
disastrous. While the soldiers were at
work there was an explosion of a compara
tively small quantity of ammunition,
which killed seven men and injured a
numoer of others. This caused much ex
citement, but the troops bravely resumed
their work. Large quantities of gunpow
der and shells were hastily removed to
places of safety, but there yet remains
enough to blow the arsenal to atoms,
should the fire reach it.
Shortly before midnight the fire was
still burning, but was thought to be under
control.
Steamer Sunk by a Collision.
LONDON, Enq., June 30 .âThe British
steamer Santaronse, from Penartn June 2
for Para, was sunk by a colli ion witn the
British bark Dundonald, from Ban Fran
cisco March 10 for Hull. The Dundonald
proceeded in a leaky and otherwise dan
gerous condition with the crew of the
Suntarenseon board. The passengers of
the Santarense were landed at Para by
the Norwegian bark Hiawatha.
JAY GOULD'S FIRST WIFE
Affidavit of an Aged Minister,
Who Performed the Mar
riage Ceremony.
An Examination Conducted Privately,
All Present Being Pledged to
Secrecy.
TUNKHANNOCK, Pa., June 30.â 1n
pursuance of a commission issued on June
19, by the Supreme Court of the city of
New York, Judge Mills, Beach M. Smith
and Joe Kelly, acting as official stenogra
pher?, and F. F. Drake and H. Harding,
as Commissioners, at the home of the Rev.
Nathan Leigbton, at this place, took Mr.
Leiph ton's testimony and that of his blind
daughter as to the alleged marriage of
Sarah Ann Angell to Jay Gould.
George S. Coleman of New York and
Walter E. Ward of Albany represented
the interests of Mrs. Anpell and ex-Judge
John F. Dillon of New York City repre
sented Helen Gould and Edwin Gould.
Elihu Root of New York was joined also
with the Gould interests.
The matter to be determined was
whether or not Mr. Leighton, who was a
Presbyterian minister, located at the little
village of Champlain, N. V., in April,
1853, united in marriage the plaintiff, now
Mrs. Ssrah Ann Angell, and Jay Gould,
then a struggling young engineer.
Early in the year an aunt of Buffalo
Bill came on here in the interest of Mrs.
Angell and interviewed the old minister,
now 85 years old and retired, and as a re
sult of that Interview an affidavit was
drafted and he accompanied Mrs. Cody to
a local Justice of the Peace and make oath
to it. In that affidavit the man was
described as Jason Gould.
The examination was conducted
privately, all present being pledged to
secrecy.

by the Turks.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â The secretary
of the Armenian Relief Society in this
city has just received a letter from S. M.
Moore, chairman of the society, who is
now in Turkey. Moore makes the as
touudiiig statement ihat since the troubles
began over 50,000 Armenians have been

New England, is said by Moore to be far
from hopeful.
ANOTHER MINE DISASTER.

explosion of mine gas occurred and Ba
rabaras and Deresti were instantly killed.
The fate of their companions is not known,
but they are also believed to be dead. The
explosion caused considerable damage to
the mine. Owing to the presence of gas
the interior cannot now be explored.
PRICE FIVE CENTS,
POPULISTS
ARE ALERT,
Are Not Pleased With the
Probable Action at
Chicago.
MAY ACT INDEPENDENT
OF DEMOCRATS.
Butler Sounds a Warning Note
Against the Schemes of
Whitney.
WILL NOT BE THROWN DOWN
IN THE STRUGGLE.
Leaders of the People's Party Prefer
to Name Their Own Candidate
for President
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 30.â The
improbability that Teller will be nomi
nated at Chicago and that a thorough
Democrat will be selected, leaves Populist
leaders to carry out their threats to nomi
nate a man of their own at St. Louis.
The attitude of most ol the Populists is
strongly suggestive that what Democrats
do will cot De pleasing to the Populists
and that they will travel the rocky road of
politics alone.
Senator Butler of North Carolina is as
suming a must independent attitude
toward the Chicago convention. In a
letter to his paper, the Caucasian, the
official Populist organ of North Carolina,
be shows his position clearly. The letter
has not yet appeared, but an advance copy
of it is in the hands of Thb Call corre
spondent. After eulogizing Senator Tel
ler's course at St. Louis, Senator Butler
writes as follows of the political situation
and of the bolt at St. Louis: "A number
of Democrats are now predicting that
Teller and his friends will jro into the
Democratic party. Of course this is idle
talk, for he will do no sucn thing. What
a grievous blunder it would be for Teller
and bis friends to leave one old t>arty and
go into another one with equally as bad a
record, simply because it is making more
fair promises at this time. There is but
one hope for silver and the people, and
that iÂ» for every man who opposes the
gold trust and monopolies to rally to
gether under the people's banner at St.
Louis on July 22.
"The announcement that ex-Secretary
Whitney would hold up on his European
trip, and that he and a uumber of other
prominent gold men would go to the Chi
cago convention, has been seized upon by
silver Democrats for party advantage.
These silver Democratic leaders who have
so long deceived the people and kept the
financial question in the background when
they knew i: was the overshadowing ques
tion. but who are now trying to hold the
honest rank and file of their party in line
when they can no longer fool them by de
claring for silver, are busily engaged in
putting up a man of straw and knocking
him down to show their courage and pat
riotism. They cry out that Whitney is
going to Chicago to get the Democratic
party to declare for the gold standard, and
that if the people will put faith in them
they will show how they will defeat Mr.
Whitney and his evil schemes at Chicago.
Now, the truth about the matter is, that
neitherWhitney nor any of the gold men
are going to Chicago for the purpose of get
ting a gold plank. The gold wing does not
want two candidates for President this
year. He is going there for quite another
purpose. It is to prevent silver men from
uniting this year.
"It is true that when Mr. Whitney gets
to Chicago he will urge Southern dele
gates to agree to a gold plank. When
they decline he will urge them to accept
a compromise plank. When they decline
he will agree to a straight free-coinage
plank, on condition that the silver men
will agree to a compromise candidate for
President, and here is where the deal will
be made. Whitney will say to them: 'II
you taKe Mr. A as your candidate the East
will not furnish any campaign funds, but
if you take Mr. B, who also claims to be
a silver man, the East will put up the
money for your campaign.'
"The thing that Mr. Whitney and the
gold men fear most is that the Democratic
National Convention might indorse Teller
for President, and they fear that if this
were done the St. Louis convention might
also indorse him, and thus the silver force
might be united. But, even if Mr. Whit
ney fails in everything else, his last card
will be to have the gold men apparently
indorse or submit to the action of the
Democratic convention, in order to
discredit it and make the union
of the silver forces impossible.
Whitney knows that the Democratic
party is so odious on account of its falsa
promises and treachery to the people that
any candidate and any course that bears
only the Democratic label is doomed to
defeat in the coming campaign. He wants
the Democratic party to run a free silver
candidate and to be defeated in the com
ing campaign, but he wants to hold the
party together, to keep Southern Demo
crats bound to Northern Democrats, be
cause in 1900 it will be necessary for the
gold men to control the National Demo
cratic Convention, put up a goldbug foi
President, and elect him through the maÂ«
chinery and by the help of the Demo*
eratic party, including the South. This it
Mr. Whitney's scheme, and for this, and
for this only, he goes to Chicago.
"Those who doubt this will learn to theii
sorrow that it is true when it will be too
late, and we predict in addition that sil
ver Democrats will be caught in his trap,
either knowingly or unknowingly."
The fear of Populist leaders is that ii
their convention should indorse the Demo
cratic nominees their party would be for.
ever swallowed up in the Democratu
party.
It would lose its identity in all futun2
contests. It would not be surprising now,
considering the positions of so many Pop
ulist leaders, to see .a nomination made at
St. Louis. The Populists will tell the
people that the Democrats did not concede
them anything, and that they could not
afford to be treated as if they did not have
any influence. After the nomination is
made, and for fear that they will be ac
cused of dividing the silver vote of the
country, Populists will spring the plan of
Briedenthal or some other scheme, that is
to have fusion electoral tickets put in the
field in Western si'ver States and in the
South, the electors to vote for whoever they
please in the electoral college when it
meets.
The Populists look upon this plan as
being the ouly one on which they can
come to an understanding A'ith the Demo
crats. The attitude of the leaders, bow
ever, may not control the convention.
Several Populist State conventions have
adopted resolutions favoring the support
of the Democratic nominees.

SENATOR TELLER GREETED.
Says the People Should Not Be De-
prived of a Meta! Intended for
Money Purposes.
OMAHA, Nebr., Jane 30.â 1t having
been announced that Senator Teller
would be at the depot this afternoon for a
short time while on his way to Denver a
large number ot people assembled. Men
crowded around him in an earnest wny to
see and talk to the man, and in response
to requests for a short address he mounted
a box on the depot platform and made a
few remarks to the friends who assembled
there.
He said the free institutions in this
country could not exist unless the United
States had acontented and prosperous
people and this latter condition could not
exist while the people were idle, hungry
and without money. This country bad
been blessed with more gold and silver
than any other country in the world and
he considered it a crime that the peo
ple should be deprived of the use of one of
those metals by legislation, which the Al
migiity undoubtedly intended to be used
for money purposes.
He considered the money question the
greatest one before the people to-day and
he said the settlement lay with the pro
ducers. There are 68,000,000 producers
who have products to sell and they were
virtually interested in the financial ques
tion and he did not think they would be
content to follow the 2.000,000 bankers and
money-changers who sought to set the
pace in this matter.
After the Senator concluded his re
marks the crowd gave him three cheers.
Senator Teller will not be present at the
Chicago convention.
ALL READY WITH A YELL.
Denver Will Give Senator Teller a
Great Ovation Upon His
Return To-Day.
DENVER, Colo., June 30.â The city be
gan to blussotu forth with decorations to
day in preparation for the great public
ovation to be given Senator Henry M.
Teiler to-morrow upon his return to his
devoted constituency. Ail classes and
men of all political faith heartily indorse
[this public demonstration, and in all the
days of planning for this event not a word
of criticism has been beard. This out
burst of enthusiasm will be practically
unanimous and it will be without let or
hindrance. Special excursion trains from
every section of the State are billed to ar
rive in tiie morning, swelling the crowds
that will fill tne streets at an early hour.
Business will be practically suspended
during the morning hours and a monster
parade of all the labor, civic and military
orders of the city will close the day's cele
bration. A beautiful reviewing stand has
been set ud at the Seventeenth and Broad
way corner of the Brown Paiace Hotel,
where Senator Telier will receive the
plaudits of marching columns. There is
no doubt about the affair being a noisy
one. The public has been advised by the
press to practice the "Teller yell," and it
will be well done.
A special car containing prominent citi
zens will meet the Senator 100 miles out
of the city, and these favored persons will
be the guard of honor to the welcomed
guest. Senator Wolcott has signified in
no manner tiiat he wiii participate in the
ovation in any way, although he has been
invited to take a prominent place.
MORETON FREEMAN WRITES
Says Crover Cleveland Has Done
Much to Retard the Cause of
Bimetallism.
DENVER. Colo., June 30.â The follow
ing letter from Morton Freeman, the
noted English bimetallist, has been made
public:
25 Chesham Place, )
London, June 17, 1896. )
Pear Mr. Mtrrttk: Thank you for your letter
and for your book, which 1 shall read with
Interest. You in toe States have at last arrived
at that currency crisis which every intelligent
student has seen so inevitably aOvncing. I
affirm with strong conviction that the way
would have been prepared during the past
three years for an International settlement of
this great difficulty, had it not been for the
attitude of just one man, your President, Mr.
Cleveland, in paying the penalty for the obsti
nate determination he has evinced through
out to thrust your country into not merely the
gold standard, but the straightest gold mono
metallism.
Those ol us who have been ardent workers
here for international bimetallism have found
ourselves at all points crossed and defeated by
Mr. Cleveland's actions aud Mr. Cleveland's
emissaries. He aentMr. Atkinson over here on
a special mission to try and persuade those in
the present Cabinetâ such men as Mr. Chaplin
and Mr. Balfourâ tbat they were "cranks";
that the concurrent legal tender of the two
metals was impracticable. Mr. fialfour's diffi
culties within Lord Salisbury's Cabinet were in
any case very great; they were made infin
itely greater by the^iidicule poured upon the
whole project of currency reform by Mr. Cleve
land, Sterling Morton, Hoke Smith and others.
The speeches and absurd letters of these gen
tlemen were six months ago to be found In
many of our daily newspapers.
So impossible had become this position (and
in this connection it was of that I am writing)
oi those members of our Government who
were pledged to currency reform because of
the attitude of the Government at Washing
ton that last year we for the time gave up the
struggle. I rejoice, then, In the revolt of the
Democratic party, and I venture to say also
that should that party be successful In electing
a free-coinage President and Congress, that
then, before Mr. Cleveland goes out of the
White House, an international arrangement
will have been secured. The T^thsrhilds
here â the wealthy investors in eve vy capital in
Europe, could not afford to Bit still and see
jour country "go it alone." Europe will re
spond to your spirited initiative. If the United
States pledges Itself to immediate free coinage,
I emphatically believe that M. Melioe, on be
half of France, will offer free mintage. We
here are pledged to reopen the Indian mints,
while the delegates to the recent conference at
Brussels, which I attended, gave us every en
couragement to nope that Germany, Austria
and Russia would, in the event of free coinage
in the United States and France, agree to pur
chase a large quantity of silver annually to
swell their legal- tender money; to purchase
it, I may add, if they can get hold of the metal
at all. Believe me, with much regard, yours,
very faithfully, Moreton Fee em am.
Hon. G. Mcrrick, Denver, Colo.

it may be truthiully Raid to represent the
sentiment of un: ..mmeled Democracy."
Governor Altgeld was made chairman
of the Illinois delegation to-day. He will
also be chairman of the committee of reso
lutions of the National Committee of the
convention, and if the silver plai.k is not
strong enough for all the Southern and
Western delegates to walk n\>on it will be
because the old man has suddenly lost the
power of expression.
Governor Altgeld was the central figure
of the silver forces to-day. Everybody
took their bats off to him. Managers of
the different candidates paid homage to
him. Political bosses sat at the foot of his
throne. He seems to be the man of the
hour. My personal opinion is that Gov
ernor Altgeld is a cunning man. He is
not great.
The silver Democrats are jubilant to
night over the prospects of controlling the
National Convention. They declare that
they will at least have a two-thirds ma
jority of the delegates and can afford to
give New York the marble heart. And
tbat is what they propose doing. They
are anxious t& demonstrate to New York
that the Empire State can no longer con
trol tne country, and will unquestionably
carry out their good intentions.
The feeling among the delegates toward
Whitney and his followers is one of re
sentment. The New Yorker has been talk
ing a good deal, as outlined in the news
paper dispatches, about the silver men
combining in a movement looking to the
violation of National honor. The dele
gates emphatically deny that such is their
intention and declare that the criticism is
unjust.
About the hotel corridors aud at the
little Democratic conferences which are
now being held daily Whitney's attitude
toward silver is the theme of discussion.
Of course be is denounced and in strong
language, too, but the old heads are will
ing to allow Whitney to have his soy,
while they manipulate the machine to
their own satisfaction. Whitney will leave
New York to-morrow and he will be fol
lowed by the New York delegation on
Tuesday.
The silver men are busy to-night mak
ing a poll of the gold and silver States.
The sound money men are in the majority
in the following State delegations: Con
necticut, Delaware, Florida, Maine. Mary
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minne
sota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washing
ton and Wisconsin.
A majority of the delegates from the
following States are claimed by the free
silver managers: Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illi
nois, Indiana, lowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Mon
tana, Nevada, North Carolina, North Da
kota, Ohio, Orepon, South Carolina, Ten
nessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,
West Virginia and Wyoming.
All the Territorial delegates are counted
in the silver column. The siiver men
have sent contesting delegations from
Michigan, Nebraska and fcouth/ Jtekoti,
Indian Territory, Arizona, New Mexico,
Oklahoma.
Delegates are pouring into the city to
nignt from different parts of the country,
and by the end of the week there will be a
great rush. Three thousand Bland boom
ers are coming on a special train from St.
Louis to-morrow, and the Boies forces,
10.000 strone, will coiie in on fast trains
from lowa on Monday and Tuesday.

ALTGELD THE BOSS.
But His Assuming the Whip Hand
May Cause Considerable Trou-
ble In the Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â The Sherman
House was the center of activity to-day.
it was in possession of the silver men,
and the great star around which they
moved in their orbits was Governor John
P. Altgeld of Illinois, who is credited with
carrying the State of Illinois in his right
hand vest-pocket. Altgeld is as shrewd a
politician aa there is in the United States.
He is a man who has his own way and
who cares nothing for criticisms, whether
from the press or from individuals. The
Governor looks like a man of that kind.
He is about 5% feet tall, broa J-shouldered,
with a decided stoop and built like a
heavy-weight prize-fighter. His compact
round bead, thick neck, aggressive Roman
nose, determined mouth and chin ami his
closely cropped hair, beard and mustache
give nim the appearance of an athlete or
aÂ» anarchist. He has taken control of
the Illinois delegation, and through them,
with his own personal influence and fol
lowing on the outside, be intends to be
dictator of the convention. As he is
known to be a firm and pronounced friend
of silver there is every livelihood that he
will succeed in his ambition.
His shrewdness, his audacity and the
irresistible energy of the man have given
the silver people the greatest confidence
in his ability to guard the interests of the
white metal, and that is the issue for
which they are here. In fact, no other is
sue is even thought of except the financial
one. Yet among the business portion of
the community Governor Altgeld is not
popular because of his outspoken sym
pathy with the railroad strikers of June
and July of last year, and because of his
having turned loose the Haymarket an
archists, who had been sentenced for life in
the Joliet penitentiary for the murder of
several Chicago policemen on the occasion
of the bomb-throwing at the Haymarket
meeting. I saw the Governor to-day and
tried to get him to commit himself on
politics or on the financial issue, but he
declined at that time to say anything
whatever upon any Bubject, but changed
his mind later when in better humor.
His thoughts are now wholly occupied
with Governor Altgeid's battle for politi
cal supremacy, and he does not wish to
jeopardize bis chances or to give his ene
mies any material for attack through the
columns of the newspapers or otherwise.
He was the leading speaker at the
executive session of the Illinois delegation
in the Sherman house this forenoon and
part of the afternoon. Tne meeting had
been called for the purpose of laying out a
plan of action to be adopted by the Illinois
delegation during the sessions of the con
vention. The proceedings were kept very
close, but I learned that Altgeld, in a fiery
speech, urged that the Illinois delegation
and the other friends of silver should as
sume control of affairs from the very start
and tiii all the convention offices with
their friends.
There is to be no compromise with the
enemy. He roust be ridden over horse,
foot and dragoons. Altgeld pointed out
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1896.
that the silver men were largely in the
majority and could do what they pleased,
therefore they should do politics and take
everything in sight. Besides he argued it
would be very bad policy and eveu danger
ous to allow tne gold men to have any
voice or hand in the affairs of the conven
tion at all. The Governor's speech seemed
to be in accord with the feelings of the
delegation and his suggestions were
formally adopted as their plan of action.
It is believed, however, that the conven
tion will not allow Illinois and Altgeld to
run things with a whip hand as they pro
pose to do. There are other ambitious
men and ambitious delegates who will
claim an equal voice in tne management
of affairs. There may be friction enough
in the convention on this subject to cause
considerable smoke and tire. A large
number of the delegations do not believe
that the Altgeld method of running a
State, a nation or a national convention is
the proper one, or one likely to meet with
the approval of the conservators of the
country, and this nice little programme,
pushed through behind the broad shoul
ders of the Governor of Illinois, will be
very likely to run up against a snag.

"SILVER DICK" LEADS.
Bland Said to Have Been Favored
at a Conference Between Stone
and Altgeld.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â A week in
advance of the date set for the opening of
the Democratic National Convention the
leaders of the silver element have donned
their armor and girded themselves for the
coming fray. To-day the Sherman House,
where the white-metal headquarter? have
bern located, resounded with the shouts
an: yells of its advocates, resplendent in
16 u> 1 badges, buttons and other insignia,
while its register bore more distinguished
names than have been inscribed in the
books of the hostelry for a quarter of a
century.
So far none of the principal advocates of
the gold standard have put in an appear
ance, and consequently the silver people
have undisputed possession of the field.
From to-morrow, however, the former will
begin to be in evidence, and from then on
every day will witness some new phase of
a battle royal between the majority and
the earnest, aggressive and unconquerable
minority.
The conspicuous features of the opening
of the war to-day were the conference be
tween the tJimetallist Democratic National
Committee and out-and-out silver men,
the meeting between Governors Stone of
Missouri and Altgeld of Illinois, and the
declaration of the Illinois delegation in
favor of tha abrogation of the two-thirds
rule as essential to a nomination. As to
the first it was much more largely at
tended than had been anticipated, in view
of the fact that it was simply a prelimin
ary meeting. Among those that responded
to the rollcall were: United States Sena
tors Harris of Tennessee, Bates of Tennes
see, Turpie of Indiana, Cockrell of Mis
souri, Daniel of Virginia, Senator-elect
Money of Mississippi,. Governors Stone of
Missouri and Alttreld of Illinois, Secretary
of State Henrichsen of Illinois, John W.
Tomlinson of Alabama, ex-Congressman
George W. Fithim of Illinois. B. F. Shive
ley of Indiana, S. B. Evuns of lowa, Judge
Shackleford of Missouri, ex-Congressman
W. J. Bryan and W. H. Thompson of Ne
braska, John Welch and Judge VV. Mul-<
lane of Oregon, O. \V. Powers of Salt Lake
City and Wiley E. Jones of Arizona.
The preliminary meeting lasted less
than an bour. The situation was infor
mally discussed and it wa9 agreed that
the silver forces need only to work har
moniously in order to insure tne adoption
of an out-and-out 16-to-l platform. What
gave the conference the most concern was
the matter of temporary organization of
the convention. The fact was dwelt upon
that the sentiment of the National Com
mittee was opposed to that of the ma
jority of the elected delegates, but on the
other hand it was insisted that it did not
necessarily follow tbat the committee
would go so far as to attempt to gain any
advantage or attempt to consummate any
strategic stroke in the exercise of the
authority vested in it.
In order to be on the safe side, however,
it was finally determined to appoint a
committee of live to wait upon the execu
tive committee of the National Committee
and, as the resolution put it, "to confer
with that body in reference to all ques
tions and matters affecting the temporary
organization and proceedings.''
The conference between Governor Stone,
the leader of the Bland forces, and Gov
ernor Altgeld was held behind double
closed doors in the latter's quarters at the
Sherman House, Colonel Charles H. Jones
of St. Louis being the only outsider pres
ent or within a hundred yards of them.
Nearly an hour was consumed in the con
ference, and at its conclusion not one of
those would say a word or breathe a sug
eestion concerning its import. Governor
Stone, however, appeared to be in particu
larly exuberant spirits, and insisted that
Bland could not oe kept out of the nomina
tion. Sixteen to one, he said, meant Bland ;
Bland meant sixteen to one; both meant
free silver, and that wag the issue of the
day. The news of the conference spread
quickly around town, and it waa at once
taken for granted that the Bland leaders
had made some kind of an alliance with
Governor Altgeld.
Tne conference created considerable un
easiness among the supporters of Gov
ernor Boies and some decidedly bitter talk
was indulged in concerning the aileeed an
tagonism of Governor Altgeld toward the
"Grand Old Man" of the lowa Democracy.
At the Boies headquarters, in the Palmer
House, it was said this evening tbat, if al
lowed to use their own inclinations, two
thirds of the Illinois delegates would vote
for the lowa man.
"We have assurances of sympathy from
a number of delegates that they would
vote for the lowa man," said a member of
the Boies committee, "but it is evident
that they are tied to the machine. What
ever the object of the Stone- Altgeld con
ference, however, we are not going to be dis
heartened by a single rebuff. Boies will
be the nominee of the convention despite
the underhanded schemes tbat the gold
men and others have resorted to. The first
named knows bis strength and they fear
him more than any other candidate that
nas been mentioned."
The meeting of the forty-eight delegates
from Illinois called by Governor Altgeid
was as lively as it was short. Governor
Altgeld made a strong speech against the
two-thirds rule, insisting that, independ
ent of present conditions, the time had ar
rived in the history of the Democratic
party when it should be abolished for the
reason that it was undemocratic It was
a basic principle of Democracy, he said,
that the majority should govern and a
two-thirds rule simply meant tyranny. It
was decided tbat the delegation, in com
mon with others, should exert its influ
ence to secure its abrogation.
JONES OF ARKANSAS.
As a Leader Among Bimetallists He
Will See That Stiver Men Are
Not Shut Out.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â Among the
more noticeable members of the Bimetal
lic League, which met in the Sherman
House to-day, was Senator Jones of Ar
kansas. He is a big man in gray clothes
with gray mustache and chin whiskers
and a forebead which by the evolution of
deep thought has been extended to the
top of his head on a line with bis ears.
He explained the reason of the meeting of
the league to be the necessity of devising
a mode of procedure, laying out a plan of
attack and defense in the interest of sil
ver, should such a course be deemed neces
sary. The Bimetallic league is an inde
pendent organization of silver men, and
therefore the results of its deliberations
will not be binding in any manner upon
the convention, but whatever there may
be of good in its suggestions will doubt
less be followed. In reply to a question as
to what the league proposes to accomplish
by its sessions Senator Jones said:
"We are not in a condition Jto sit down
and allow ourselves to be walked upon.
We understand that a majority of the Na
tional Committee are in favor of gold, and
we propose to have our forces united and
to raise a vigorous protest in case the com
mittee attempts to unseat auy silver dele
gates. A false report has been circulated
to the effect that we are here in the inter
ests of some particular candidate. We are
not here in the interest of any candidate,
person or clique. All the candidates who
have been mentioned thus far have their
friends in the league, and we have always
refused to discuss the candidacy of any
particular individual. We want the strong
est man nominated, and there will be no
effort made to advance or retard the can
didacy of any one. Here are representa
tives from every silver State in the Union,
and there is no doubt that every candi
date will have his friends present at the
meeting."
The Senator said also that the local re
porters who bad interviewed him yester
day had misrepresented him most outrage
ously when they quoted him as intimating
in any way that the meeting was to be in
the interest of some one candidate.
"A sort of suspicion has been created by
the papers," continued the speaker, "tbat
the gold men are trying to take some un
derhanded advantage of the silver men in
the convention. We will see that such
will not happen. If they give us fair
treatment without any compulsion on our
part we will be satisfied, but if they don't
do it," added the Senator with a deter
mined pressure of the lips and a dark
frown tbat had no silver lining to it, "we
have GOO delegates who will see tbat the
cause of silver will ha7e a fair show. But
if the committee does not act fairly my
idea will be to take the matter in our own
hands, nominate a temporary chairman
and elect him."
"How about the two-thirds majority
rule?" I asked.
"The two-third majority rule does not
affect anything except the nomination for
President. We have got a large majority
of the convention and they have a large
majority of the National Committee."
"Has any gold candidate been men
tioned?" was asked.
"I have not beard of any jrold candi
date," replied the Senator. "There is one
danger that the gold men may unite on
some candidate who is the least objection
able to them and the most objectionable
to the silver men."

UTAH FOR SILVER.
Powers of Salt Lake Predicts the
Success of the White Metal
Men in the Struggle.
CHICAGO^ Ill\ Jun? 30 -The T'tah
delegation will not be here until next
Sunday morning, but one of its members,
0. W. Powers of Salt Lake, has arrived
early in the lignt, and attended the meet
ing of the Bimetallic League to-day. In
the brief conversation which I had with
him I discovered that he was one of the
most enthusiastic advocates of the white
metal. He said tnat was the only issue
before the people of Utah, as well as be
fore the people of the whole country. He
expressed the opinion that even if every
member of the National Committee were
a gold man the committee would be un
able to undo the work of the people and
to disregard their wishes as expressed in
the platforms and instructions of the ma
jority -of States, which had declared for
free coinage. He did not think that the
committee would dare to unseat silver
delegates and give their places to contest
ing delegates who favor gold.
"The work would have to be too coarse
and the convention would not stand it,"
added Mr. Powers. "The National Com
mittee would have to change more than
100 votes in the convention and they will
not dare to attempt it. There would be a
tremendous row if anything of that kind
was tried. The silver men are here with
blood in their eyes and will not stand any
foolishness. McKinley has not a ghost of
a show. The leading Republicans over in
our country are going to vote for the
Democratic Presidential Electors and they
will send silver men to Congress because
that is the only kind of men tbat will run
for Congress over in Utah.
"The gold men are mistaken when they
say that the people of the East are opposed
to the free coinage of silver," added Mr.
Powers. "Louis County, N. V., Governor
Flower's own county, instructed its dele
gates for silver,and Medina in Western New
York did the same. There was no discus
sion of this question either in the press or
public meetings, but it bad broken out in
that great city of New York in spots, so
you may have an idea of what it will do
when it is going to be talked among the
people during the campaign. A most
wonderful tidal wave in favor of free coin
age is sweeping over the country. One of
the best arguments in favor of free coin
age is the fact that at the time silver was
demonetized silver was Scents above par."

PENNOYER'S BOOM.
It Will Be Unchained Soon by Silver
Champions From the Web
foot State.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â With the ar
rival of the silver champions to-day came
a little Presidential boom all the way
from Oregon. It was in the interest of
Sylvester Pennoyer, ex Governor of the
State and esteemed throughout the Nation
as one of the most eccentric characters
that the Pacific Coast has produced. His
versatility as an essayist, however, is uni
versally admired and it is conceded that
if heaven should so rule that Pennoyer
became President of the United States he
would send forth from the White House
Thanksgiving day and Bthtf messages
that would stand aa models for Presidental
successors in generations to come.
Sylvester Fennoyer's little boom was
started by a delegate to the National Dem
ocratic Convention. His strong argument
is that with a silver platform and Pen
noyer as the candidate the populace of the
country would scramble into the Demo
cratic band wagon and follow the leader
ship of the eccentric statesman from t ie
beautiful land "where rolls the Oregon."
Dr. John Mullinix and John R. Welch
have the Pennoyer boom boxed up in
their room at the Palmer House. They
will probably oat the chains that bind it
in a few days, and then keep your eyes
riveted on the ex-Governor of the webfoot
State. Fennoyer is the choice of the Ore
gon delegation for the Presidential nomi
nation, and Dr. Mullinix will probably
present his name to the convention. Says
the doctor:
"We shall present to the convention the
name of ex-Governor Pennoyer of Oregon,
and we have every confidence tbat other
States will support him. Governor Pen
noyer is for many reasons the most logical
candidates for the Democrats to put up on
a 16 to 1 platform. He served two terms
as Governor of the State, both times over
coming large Republican majorities, and
is the first Governor who broke with the
present National administration on the
question of finance. He is a man of fine
education, great personal magnetism, ad
mirable executive ability, and is an excel
lent speaker and writer, mentally and poli
tically head and shoulders above many of
th men who are being pushed forward for
the nomination, and there is no question
but if he should be nominated the Popu
lists would ratify the nomination. Of
course the fact that he comes from a State
clear at onÂ© side of the country may mili
tate against his chances, but yet it seems
appropriate that a silver man should be
from a silver-producing State, and nearly
all of the silver is mined west of the Rocky
Mountains.
"In case we are unsuccessful in securing
the nomination of ex-Governor Pennoyer,"
added Dr. Mullinix, "we shall gladly and
cheerfully support any free-silver candi
date whom the convention may see nt to
name. We in the West think that free
silver is the only question before the pub
lic. Protection and free trade v.ill cut
very little figure in the campaign. The
maiu issue is the money question, and to
it wÂ« must first pay attention. Any good
free-silyer man will receive the votes of
Oregon Democrats, and I cannot say that
we have any decided preference between
Bland, I'oies or the other prominent can
didates, We are going into the conven
tion to nominate Pennoyer. Failing in
this, we have no plans except to lend our
heartiest support to the ticket which may
be nominated."
The other members of the Oregon dele
gation will reach Chicago not later tbat
July 5, and will be accompanied by a
number of politicians from the Western
State. The headquarters of the delega
tion will be at the Palmer House. The
California delegation will be quartered at
the Sherman House. .Frank McGtjire.
D. R. BRANT'S CIRCULAR.
Views on the Money Question That
Meet the Approval of the Sil
ver Champions.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â One of the
most noticeable local silver advocates in
the lobby of the Sherman House this
morning was D. R. Brant, who has been a
resident of Chicago for thirty-hve years.
He was industriously engaged in circu
lating a printed folder containing his plat
form of principles. When asked as to his
opinions on the financial questions he
said :
"I don't believe that there is a strictly
honest man in tiie world. There never
has been and never will be; but I believe
that I am about as honest as they make
them, and I say that the man who will be
for gold is either a blank dasbed fool ox a
traitor to bis wife, his children, his friends
and his country.
After announcing tbat potatoes are sell
ing at from 10 to 17 cents a bushel, oats at
16 and 17 cents, corn 28 cents and wheat at
56 cents, Mr. Brant's circular went on to
say :
"Now, therefore, we, the Democrat^!
party, hereby declare: Firstâ That Cofi-*
{rress, as soon as it convenes, shall appoint
a committee of, say five, of its ablest mem
bers, irrespeciive of party to draft and
create a tariff bill, sufficient with the other
income of the Government to defray every
dollar of the current expenses of the Gov
ernment and pay the interest on their
public debt, and also to set a?ide for that
purpose or pay in the original public debt
at least $100,000,000 a year until it is all
paid off and out of the way, as we don't
want to leave that old debt as a heritage
for our children. And to this end and for
this purpose we suggest that a graded
income tax law be enacted, but taxing
none on an income who has not made
and cleared $3000 a year, and on that
amount 1 per cent, and from 1 per cent up
to as much as 10 per cent on their annual
incomes. This would give the Govern
ment annually probably $150,000,000, and
it would collect it from sources and par
ties who could pay it without feeling it,
and would tend to lighten the burdens of
the poor.
"Next, instead of retiring the few green
backs now left in circulation in the coun
try, as the Republicans want to do, we are
clearly of the opinion, and we urge and
insist on it, that the Government issue
forthwith and keep on hand a very
large amount of greenback Government
money, fully sufficient for any and all
emergencies, and every dollar of it a full
legal tender for all debts, public or pri
vate, and redeemable in the coin of this
country; ana any man or party in the
United States o* America refusing to take
it, or in any way dishonor It, shall be
deemed guilty of a penal offense and pun
ishable by heavy fine or imprisonment,
und no bills less than for $5. Next, and
chief of all, we urge and insist and de
mand, to ali intents and purposes, that
every dollar of gold and silver found any
where in the limits and confines of the
United States of America shall be imme
diately coined into the dollars of our
daddies, just a3 they are nowâ l 6to Iâ and

or paper issued by the Government of the
United States, and containing the siamp
of the United States as money, shall be a
full legal tender, without any discrimina
tion whatever.
"And, in this connection, we may say
we read with horror and amazement that
the Republicans at St. Louis, in their
platform, have declared against the un
limited coinage ot silver and in favor of
gold alone, thus making the rich richer
and the poor pocier, for it cannot be
v'ewed nor explained in any other way,
but that would surely be the result, ana
it looks to us, from the fact that the few
isolated rich goldbugs, who now own 95
per cent of all the money in the land, and
especially so of goldâ for that article don't
circulate at allâ that, by their infamous
and wicked attempt to demonetize silver,
they are seeking to double the value of
their money, and thus make every dollar
worth two dollars, and, indeed, as already
shown from tne depressed markets of the
land, all dollars are now worth about two
dollars or more, and so far as the word
'sound mom-y 1 is concerned, as used by
Cleveland and others, of the one species
alone of money (gold), we regard the
word 'sound money,' as thus used by
them and thiown at us (silver and gold),
as a direct insult, as though we, the Dem
ocratic party, always and for all time
since the foundation of this Government
the advocates of gold and silver as the
basis of all money, did not now want
good money, and gold and silver, as they
now are and always have been at the back
of all money. Shame on such an infamous
idea and insult.
"So far as tne wants and needs of the
Government (for gold) is concerned, if a
sufficient tariff is enacted at once so as to
always turn the balance of trade in our
favor, and such other legislation as can be
easily enacted is adopted, together with
all the safeguards referred to already, the
Government will not be subjected to any
ereat strain for gold for its needs, except
possibly to pay any of the gold-bearing
bonds recently very foolishly created, as
of course all debts must be paid according
to aereement; but so far as a single gold
standard is concerned we are utterly op
posed to it, and always have been and al
ways will be, as the Democratic creed
always has been.
"Gold and silver as they now are, 16 to
1, at the back of all money without any
discrimination whatever, and as has been
already shown the country generally is in
the deepest possible distress fur more good
money â not wildcat money such as we
had before the war, nor 50-ccnt money as
our enemies and the enemies of our com
mon country pretend to charge to us as
Democrats.
"Is there a man in his senses in the
world who will say it is best to strike
down and take out of use and refuse to
coin any more silver for use as money in
this or any other country ? Surely such a
consummate fool as that ought not to
live. Does not every man know that it is
not possible to do the business of this or
any other country as successfully on half
enough money as they can if they have
plenty of money, and is not the scarcity
of money now the cause of all the distress
and low prices and staenation in business
in this country (and that, too, with ali our
money in use, gold, silver and paper)?
And it has been â and is now â growing
worse ever since the law for the coinage of
$4,500,000 worth of silver a month was un
fortunately repealed and abolished (what
a pity !) and it is indeed strange that such
cruel errors and wrong should obtain in
the Congress of our country.
â  "And hence we here and now say, give
us plenty ol greenbacks of the denomina
tion of $5 and upward (that don't bear
any interest) and every dollar a legal ten
der and redeemable in the coin of this
Government, and the full, free and unlim
ited coinage of every dollar of gold and
silver found in this country exactly M
they are now, 16 to 1, and let this money,
gold, silver and greenbacks be the money
of the country (in the main), and all
equal and upon an equality with gold, and
give us Horace Boies for President, and we
promise you that these cruel and terrible
times will very soon give way and disap
pear and a season of the best times this
country has ever had and enjoyed since
the foundation of thu Government will be
the result sure, etc."
Mr. Brant had a fine voice and held
forth for an hour in the lobby to-day. He
received an order from the silver men for
several thousand copies of pis circular for

TELLER NOT FAVORED.
Altgeld Men Want a Democrat Who
Will Be Supported by the
West and South.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â Secretary of
State Henrichsen, who is one of the Illinois
delegates at large and chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee, said
after the Altgeld-Stone conference, when
asked if the Illinois delegation was favor
able to Boies: "Well, we want a man who
is a friend of labor."
When Teller was suggested the chief
lieutenant of Governor Altgeld remarked :
"Not in a thousand years. We want a
Democrat who will get the support of the
Populists and Westerners generally."
It is reported tbat Altgeld is to bo sup
ported for permauent chairman by the
lull Bland strength. In support of this
report Senator Cockrell and Colonel
Charles H. Jones, after a meeting, de
clared their preference for Altgeld, al
though Senator Harris is the choice of the
I bimetallic committee.
The Bland headquarters were thronged
with more ;allers ail day than were at the
smaller Boies quarters, and several silver
Republicans came to express their Bland
preferences.
The sut>-committee of the National
Democratic Committee having charge ,of
the distribution of convention hall space
and seats among the newspaper appli
cants finished their arduous work to-day
so far as to prepare a report of their rec
ommendations, to be acted upon to-mor
row by the execntive committee. The
members think that a lot of applicants
can get along well enough without table
seats by bein? provided with seats else
where- than in the press gallery and by
depending on the press associations.
Colonel Martin, the sergeant-at-arms,
wa3 missed to-day at his headquarters by
hundreds of callers, who wanted to know
about tickets and appointments of assist
ants of various kinds He spent the day
in St. Louis, attending chiefly to the selec
tion of numerous trusty men of his ac
quaintance to keep the licketless crowd
out of the Coliseum.
Ex-Governor James E. Boyd of Nebraska
was an arrival at the Auditorium to-day.

ILLINOIS IS FOR BLAND.
Governor Stone of Missouri Se- .
cures the Pledge of Support
From Altgeld.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â The indica
tions late to-night are that the forty-eight
votes of Illinois will be given to ex-Con
gressman Blan 1. This pledge of support,
it is reported, : s thcoutcome of the secret
meeting of Governor Altgeld of Illinois,
Governor Stone of Missouri, the com
mander of the Bland campaign, together
with a few trusted mtmbers of the Illinois
delegation.
Thomas Gauan, chairman of the Cook
County Central Committee of the Demo
cratic party and slated to succeed Ben
Cable on the Jiational Committee, said to
night: "It's going to be Bland. He will
get the Illinois vote." Mr. Gahan day
clined to enter into further details as to
the meeting.
Governor Stone did some ouiet but ap
pareptly effective work among his politi
cal acquaintances until a late hour to
night. He said to the United Press
reporter:
"The prospects or Mr. Bland's nomina
tion are excellent. I believe he will be
nominated and elected. I have been
among my Congressional and Se atorial
friends most of tha evening and meeting
other eer.tlemen waom I wanted to know.
I think it is a little early yet to give any
figures as to Mr. Band's strength, but the
developments of tie day have been very
satisfactory to us."
As to the latest intimation of a bolt of
the gold men, Governor Stone Baid:
"There is no string tied to the gold dele
gates and we will not make any move to
prevent their bolting, but I should pre
sume from the fact that Mr. Whitney and
other gold gentlemen from the East in
tend to take part in the convention that
they should not bait."
A. S. Trude, 03 behalf of the Illinois
delegation, will appear before the execu
tive committee of the National Committee
to-morrow and a:k for the selection of a
free silver Democrat as temporary chair
man. It Is und< rstood among the party
machine men hen that if the demand for
Illinois doorkeepers is refused the silver
delegates in the convention will move to
have another man elected to the position
of sergeant-at-Â»rms of the convention.
The only arrival of importance to-night
was tbat of Benator Blackburn of Ken
tucky, ;hu victorls"-'S silver advocate. ' 'â *

P lido, a baker, 22 years old, residents of
JÂ»rnce, Havana Province, were taken
from their homes recently to the outskirts
o; the town and shot by the Spanish civil

schooner sailed from Havana despite the
vi.-H&nce of the Spanish authorities.
On the night of June 26 the inhabitants
of Mordazo, province of Santa Clara, were
surprised by the presence of rebels, who
had entered the town without arousing
tiic troops, who were supposed to be de
tecting the place. The insurgents looted
a st re and killed a clerk and cousin of
the owner. The parrison, finally learning
wh:.t was going on under their very noses,
rushed to arms and attacked the invaders,
who were, according to the Government
repcrt, compelled to retire with the loss of

CONFLICTING REPORTS.
But the Filibusters Undoubtedly landed
Their Cargoes.
>V YOKK, N. x*., June 30.â The Re
" â¢ der says Senor Dupuy de Lome, tLe
r-anish Minister to Washington, has re
ceived tne following cablegram from the
Duke de Tetuan, Spanish Secretary of
State:
"According to advices from the field the
Spanish troops have captured the Ameri
can filibusters who recently landed in
Cuba, after a sharp fight, in which many
rebels were killed and wounded."
Senor Enrique Trujillo, editor of the El
Porvenir, tne New York organ of the
Cuban revolutionary party, yesterday re
cei-ed confirmation of the report that the
expeditions taken to Cuba by the Commo
dore and the Three Friends were safely
landed.
The expedition on the Commodore con
sisted of eighteen men under the leader
ship of Ricardo Trujillo. They took with
them 400 Manser rifles, 385,000 rounds of
ammunition and 2-5 cases of explosives and
medicines.
Or. the Three Friends were Senor Julian
Sarraga, a lawyer, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Francisco Leyte Vidal, with 41 men. They
bad charge of 600 Manser rifles, 480,000
rounds of ammunition and 50 cases of ex
plosives and medicines.
Senor Trujillo said yesterday that the
outlook was brighter than ever for the
Cubans.
"The invasion of Las Villas," he said,
"has been most successful, and there is
no necessity of mere troops from the
Kastern provinces. The safe landing of
the expeditions sent to the coasts of
tamaguay and Santiago have supplied
J se Maceo, ltabi, Garcia and Gomez with
ell the war material they require for the
present, and they have been engaging the
Spaniards very briskly. Antonio Maceo
is also well provided tor. As to the in-
surgents near Havana, they may be ex
pected to give a good account of them
.selves."
TO DYNAMITE HAVANA.
Proper Horning Will Be Given Friends
of the. Insurgents.
NEW YORK, N. V., June SO.^Tomas
Etirada Palma, the Cuban delegate, yes
terday received from Cuba one of the cir
cular which have been distributed in the
city of Havana by the insurgents, telling
of their intention of blowing the city to
pieces by the use of dynamite in the cause
of independence.
"It is not the intention of the Cubans
to blow up the City o! Havana at once,"
Mr. Palma said. "There are too many
good and loyal advocates of our cause in
Havana who might be annihilated by a
simultaneous blowing up of houses. Great
care in respect to Cuban Bycirmthizeis will
be employed.
'â¢It is also intended to discriminate in
regard to American citizens and in regard
to persons who are supposed to be neutral.
It is certain that the first structures that
will suffer will be the public buildings that
are now in control of the Spanish authori
ties."

MONTREAL, Quebec, June 30.â 1t is
stated here on good authority that Lord
Aberdeen has recommended Hon. Mr.
Laurier to her Majesty for knighthood.
Laurier's policy, outlined by tne Toronto
Globe, will include a new franchise act,
a new rearrangement of the constituencies,
retrenchment in public expenditures, de
velopment of Canada's mining resources
and booming immigration by calling at
tention to Canada's opportunities in an
intelligent, truthful, discriminating way,
and tariff reform. The latter will n"t be
on a basis of free trade, but half way be

THE TREASURY DEFICIT.
Uncle Sam Suns Behind $137,500,000
in Three Hears.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 80.-The
treasury official statement to be issued to
morrow will show that tbe receipts from
all sources for the fiscal year 1896 approxi
mate $326,500,000 and the expenditures for
the like period $352,000,000, making the
deficit for the fiscal year $25,500,000. For
1895 the deficit was $42,000,000, and for 1894
$70,000,000, so that the deficit for th 9 past
three years aggregates $137,500,000. For
the mouth of June, which closes to-day,
the receipts I'ave beon $26,500,000, and the
expenditures $25,000,000, making an ex
cess of receipts of $1,500,000. Because of
the heavy interest payments in July, the
payments of the sugar bounty claims,
which will be commenced in that month,
and also because of appropriations made
available by Congress, ft is estimated that
the deficit for July will foot up nearly
$10,000,000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1896.
DIGGING THROUGH
THE LONG DRIFTS,
Heroic Efforts Are Being
Made to Rescue the
Entombed Men.
GAIN LITTLE PROGRESS
Those at Work Must Yet Pene
trate a Long Distance to
Reach the Victims.
SMALL HOPE NOW REMAINS.
At Least Fifty-Eight Men Perished in
the Twin Shaft at Pittston
Jnnction.
WILKESBARRB. Pa., June 80.â
Another twenty-four hours have rolled
away and still the men at Twin Shaft,
Pittston Junction, are making heroic
efforts to reach the men entombed, and
more progress was made this afternoon
than has been made since the work began.
There was no further squeezing in the
gangway or slope, and the men were not
interfered with in placing timbers aud*
feeling their way cautiously alo.ig.
On account of the favorable conditions
to-day the men have gone about 200 feet
farther into the slope than they were the
night previous, and reached the edge of
the cave. It is presumed that the en
torn bed are about 700 feet from the edge of
the cave, and in order to reach the bodies
digging wis begun with all vieor.
The timbers behind the workers showed
no signs of bending, and all the officials
are agreed that everything was in eood
condition.
To dig away the full 700 feet and reach
the bodies will take twelve or fifteen hours
longer, if everything continues favorable.
But the officials and rescuers think there
are open spaces beyond the edge of the
fall, which, of course, would not have to
be dug, and in these places the men would
only >,aye to secure the roof. If the slope
is solidly choked up the digging would
take a couple of weeks, but if the fall is
not heavy and there are open spaces the
men may be reached any time within the
next fifteen hours. This refers to the
main body of men entombed.
It was known that Mayor Langan and
some of the other men were not as far in
the slore as the others, and to-day it was
j thought probable by the officers that their
bodies might be reached at any time dur
; ing that time. The air is cood and it still
freely circulates among the rescuers.
The company has completed a careful
and systematic canvass of the names and
the number of men who have perished in
the ill-fated mine. This list sbows that
there are but fifty-eient men all told.
REED CALLS ON PLATT.
The Maine Statesman Will Go on
the Stump In New York Jn the
Interests of McKinley.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 30.-The
Herald says this morning: Speaker
Thomas B. Reed came to the city yester
day and called on Thomas C. Platt.
Speaker Reed and Mr. Platt had a iong
conference, during which the man from
Maine told Mr. Platt that he would take
the stump for McKinley in this State
under the auspices of the regular Republi
can organization. He has not been asked
by the McKinley manager yet to speas for
McKinley, but Platt has asked him, and
Reed will De heard from the stump.
Speaker Reed agrees with Governor
iiushnell of Ohio that the Republicans are
not going to have a walkover in this cam
paign. He is surprised at the growth of
the silver sentiment, and he thinks the
McKinley managers *ould do well not to
alienate the politicians who are anxious to
get votes for their candidate. f
Reed quite warmly syrnpatbizeo with
Platt in his struggle to stay in the McKin
ley ranks, nnd he expressed the opinion
yesterday that there would be no trouble
from the McKinley managers as soon as
they understood the situation. In this
connection it may be said that Reed has
quite forgiven Joseph Manley for his ac
tion at St. Louis, and has told Manley
that he is satisfied that his declaration
tbat McKinley would be nominated
was merely bad judgment and not treach
ery.
The gossip about Reed's retiring from
Congress and coming to this city to prac
tice law is revived. It is said that he is
now considering a proposition to visit
Germany before the reassembling of Con
gress as the attorney for the American
insurance companies now shut out of
Prussia.
Reed and Platt bad a talk about the
financial plank at St. Louis and the
Speaker congratulated the New Yorker
on the part he played.
CALIFORNIA IS SAFE.
Ex-Senator Felton Says the Elec-
tlon Will Be Fouarht Out on the
Tarlff Issue.
CHICAGO, 111., June 30.â Ex-Senator
C. N. Felton of California is at the Audi
torium. "California will cast her electoral
vote for McKinley and protection, " said
the ex-Senator. "In the first place, Cali
fornia is a Republican State, anyhow, but
if it were a Democratic State it would go
Republican this year. What tbe great
mass of people want now is work. They
want employment, an opportunity to earn
a living. I do not think tbe silver ques
tion will cut much of a figure in the cam
paign after it is started. Of course, they
talk of silver, but when the question is
laid before them there is no doubt as to
the result. The election will be fought
out on the tariff issue."
NEBRASKA REPUBLICANS.
Considerable Uncertainty Sur
rounds the Probable Action of
the Convention.
LINCOLN, Nebr., June 30.â More of the
element of uncertainty surrounds the ac
tion of to-morrow's Republican State Con
vention than at any similar gathering in
the history of the party in the State. In
terest centers largely the gubernatorial
nomination, for which there are five can
didatesâJack Mac Coll of Dawson County,
Congressman John D. Meikiejohn of
Nance, M. L. Hayward of Otoe, C. M.
Adams of Nick oils and Elijah of Gage,
their comparative strength being probably
in the order named. The contest for
Treasurer and State Auditor is almost as
tierce as that for first place, with an even
greater number of aspirants for each. The
platform will probably be short and to the
Doint. There is little question of its
declaration for sound money and distinct
disavowal of anything that savors of
Populism in the slightest degree.
The convention will be called to order
shortly before noon, with G. W. Collins of
Pawnee County : as , temporary chairman.
Many of the delegates think it Will re
quire two days to complete the work.

BRINGS A BRIDE
TO SAN JOSE,
Capitalist Murphy Surprises
His Clubmates in the
Garden City.
RETURNS FROM MEXICO.
He Was Married Over a Year
Ago to Katherine Martin
of Oakland.
RICHES GAINED IN DURANGO.
Has Become the Owner of Nearly a
Million Acres of Timber
Land.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. June 30.â Dan M.
Murphy, the popular young society and
club man ana land king, has returned
from a trip to Eagle Pass, Mexico, where
he has extensive enterprises under way.
Mr. Murphy owns a large portion of the
State of Durango, the most fertile section
of tbe southern republic, mid there is a
prospect that when the work now in hand
is accomplished there will be in si^ht, on
land of which he is the sole owner, about
$100,000,000 worth of material for which
there is a ready market. A large force of
men is now making a road and when this
is completed to Durango lively times will
be inaugurated in that region. Sawmills
are to be erected and teams and men by
by tbe hundreds given employment put
ting lumber into a market which cannot
be fully dupplied for years.
In talking of the prospe cts for the im
mediate future Mr. Murphy appeared to
be very much elated, and when it leaked
out that he had returned with a wife his
friends had occasion to doubly congratu
late him, and also tbe young lady, on tbe
prospect of such a bright future. Although
the marriage occurred over a year ago few
other than intimate friends were aware
that Mr. Murphy was married at Los An
geles in March, 1895, to Miss Katherine
Martin of Oakland, a beautiful and tal
ented young lady. Tbty are now the
guestÃ of his mother, Mrs. Murphy-Colum
bet, at her elegant residence at the corner
of Fifth and William streets. When
questioned by a Call represenative to-day
Mr. Murphy said:
"There are bright business prospects in
Durango and otner parts of Northern
Mexico. It is a rich country, and its
growth is steady and certain to continue
for years to come. The greatest single in
dustry, present and prospective, is that of
lumber.
"There is a demand for lumber that can
not be fully supplied for some time to
come. The business is ahead of mining
and everybody is anxious to engage in it.
At present the source of supply ia Eastern
Texas, and building material is high Iq
consequence. I have 800,000 acres of fine
timber a short distance from the city of
Durango and situated so as to control the
trade of Northern Mexico.
"The preparations for getting out this
lumber are now under way. I am having
a road constructed from the city of Du
rango, a distance of eighteen miles, which
will be the tinest wagon road in Northern
Mexico.
"When this is completed the hauling of
ties will begin. I have made arrange
ments to deliver at Durange 200,000 ties a
year, which cost but a few cents each to
get out, and will sell for 70 cents a piece.
Aside from the railroad ties, telegraph
poies, wood and charcoal, there is $96,000, -
-0W) worth of sawmill lumber in sight on
my ranch, according to the estimates of
two civil engineers. It is my purpose to
erect sawmills and get out lumber as
rapidly as possible.
"Yes," said Mr. Murphy in conclusion,
'â¢the prospects in Durango are very bright
indeed, and I am well satisfied."
PRINDLE-PAY COUNTEST.
Judge Lorigan Allows an Extension of
Time in the Injunction Case.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 30. â Judge
Lorigan this afternoon made an order in
the case brought to dissolve the injunc
tion restraining J. P. Fay from taking the
seat in the City Council from the Second
Ward occupied by Homer Prindle allow
ing Fay to file a new statement of election
expenses, as required Dy law.
The returns from the Second Wavd at
the city election in April gave Prindle
(Ind.)a majority of thirteen over Fay (R.).
Fay contested the election, and on a re
count of the ballots was found to have a
majority of four votes. He was declared
elected and entitled to Prindle's seat, and
was given a certificate of election. Prindle
then procured an injunction restraining
Fay from taking hid seat in the Council
on the ground that Fay's statement of
election expenses had noi been properly
tiled. The testimony taken showed that
the error in the filing of the statement
was not Fay's fault, but was the fault of
the clerk who took the statement to tile.
The matter of dissolving the injunction
will be argued on Friday.

NAVAL COURT,
Witness Tobin Attempts to
Strike a Lawyer for
the Defense.
STUNG BY A QUESTION.
Is Asked If He Did Not Threaten
to Take the Life of His
Mother.
WEBSTER' 3 UNIQUE DEFENSE i
Trying to Prove That He Accepted a
Personal Loan, but Not a
Tithe.
VALLEJO, Cal., June 30.â The court
martial of Assistant Paymaster Webster
oi the Yorktown developed several sensa
tional incidents to-day. The accused man's
attorneys are endeavoring to prove that
the $2500 paid to him by W. J. Tobin was
a personal loan, and that he was not com
pelled to advance this sum as a tithe, or
so-called cash bond, in order to secure a
clerksbiD under Webster. During the
cross-examination of Tobin this afternoon
Lawyer Haymond asked a question which
caused Tobin to leap toward him with fists
clenched and eyes aflame. The enraged
young man was with difficulty restrained
and induced to resume his seat.
Before the record of the preceding day 'a
proceedings was approved by the board
this morning Attorney Haymond moved
to strike out certain portions of Edward
McGettigan's testimony on tbe ground
that it was hearsay. Haymond argued his
motion at length and Lieutenant Lochei
mer, the judge-advocate, responded. The
argument on the point consumed more
than an hour. Then the courtroom was
cleared while the court deliberated, and
after a full consideration the motion to
strike out was denied.
The cross-examination of Tobin was
postponed Dy consent of counsel until the
testimony of District^Attorney Frank R.
Devlin, who is attorney for the Tobin
estate, was taken. Mr. Devlin told of cer
tain advances made by Webster looking
to a settlement with the late Mrs. Tobin
of the indebtedness, both before and after
the court of inquiry had been ordered.
Counsel for the accused was apparently
anxious for this to appear as tending to
show a disposition on the part of Webstar
to settle before the present proceedings
were instituted.
Tobin was cross-examined this after
noon, the object of the defense evidently
being to prove that the sain of $2500 was
advanced as a personal loan from Yv. J.
Tobin to Webster, and was not in tbe na
ture of a bond. For a moment there was
much suppressed excitement through the
courtroom when Lawyer Haymond asked
if he (Tobin) had not demanded tbat his
mother pay the $2500 to Paymaster Web
ster, and if be did not threaten to shoot
her if she did not give the money. The
words were scarcely out of the attorney's
mouth before Tobin had jumped to his
feet and was about to make for the ques
tioner. He was restrained by the court
and judge advocate and then gave an
emphatic "No, sir!" to the question.

OOVERNOR McG RAW'S VIEWS.
Certain That McKinley Will Carry the
Pacific Coast State:
SEATTLE, Wash., June 30.â Governor
McGraw, who attended the St. Louis con
vention with the Washington delegation,
returned home this afternoon. Fiom the
convention city the executive journeyed
to Canton, where he had an interview of
several hours' duration, as well as a drive
about the city with Governor McKinley.
Governor McGraw said McKinley ap
peared to be averse to traveling about
the country making campaign speeches,
but that he would do so if requested by
the National Committee.
yr ".Major McKinley regards the tariff as
' the paramount issue in this campaign,"
Washington's chief executive observed,
in discussing his conference with the
National standard bearer, "and, indeed,
that seems to be the opinion . of leading
Republicans throughout the East. , I may
also add that 98 per cent of the people,
regardless of politics, believe in interna
tional bimetallism. Only about 2 per cent
of the population of this country want free
and unlimited coinage of silver."
In discussing party disaffection and es
pecially the St. Louis bolters Governor Mo-
Graw styled Senator Teller a "silver mono
metalhst." He does not believe the Demo
crats and Populists will fuse, and when
asked if, in such an event, the fusion
leaders would carry the Pacific Coast
States, the Governor with emphasis de
clared that thsy would not. v :. >
"I am certain," he said, "that Washing
ton, Oregon and California will cast their
electoral votes for McKinley."
NETADA POPULISTS.
Delegates to St. loulj yarned by the
Central Committee.
RENO, Niv., June 30.â The Populist
Etate Central Committee met here to-day.

J. B. McCulloch, B. F. Curler and Will
iam Thompson of Washoe, W. VV. Dunn

ecutive committee to look after campaign
affairs. In their hands the selection of

Burke left to-nicht for Chicago to attend

Chicago in order to manufacture a boom.
I am "naturally proud of my State's in
dorsement â not that I am an avowed can
didate for the high office, but as an ex
pression of approval by the peoplo of my
own State of my course in the Senate of
the United States. Further than this I
have nothing to say."
SAN DIEGO WATER WAR,
The City Enjcined From Selling
the Bonds for the New
System.
Charges of Fraud. Preferred by the
Csmpanv Vot?d Out of a
Mcnopo'y.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., June 30.â The San
Diego Water Company to-day instituted
an action against the City of San Diego,
, tbe Common Council and the Southern
California Mountain Water Company In
the Superior Court praying for an injunc
tion to restrain the city from signing,
issuing, selling or executing bonds f~r con
structing the water system voted upon by
the people last Saturday.
It is alleged in the complaint that the
declaration of tne City Council on Mon
day night last that the bonds had carried
was la!so; for the reason that two-thirds of
the qualified electors of the city did not
vote for incurring the indebtedness; that
the election was fraudulently carried on;
that more than two hundred persons vot
ing in favor of the bonds were not quali
fied electors of the city, and that more
than a hundred persons who voted in
favor of the bonds were challenged at the
polls, but were allowed by the election
boards to vote without being sworn In.
The complaint also alleged that more
than 300 persons were influenced to vote for
the bonds by means of bribery ; ttat more
than 200 voters had no right to be on tbe
great register, but had registered in the
name of other persons, dead or removed;
that more than 700 were registered in the
supplement to the great register, instead
of the great register itself. It is alleged
that the city is using only about 160 inches
of water, and the remaining 840 inches
voted for cannot be used by the city, and
that the sole reason of its acquisition is for
the purpose of subsidizing the Southern
California Mountain Water Company and
aidinz the construction of a dam, reser
voir sites, etc., to be used for irrigating
lands outside the city.
In accordance with the prayer of the
complainant. Judge Tor.^nts granted a
temporary injunction, restraining the de
fendants from issuing, selling or signing
or executing the bonds. The sureties on
the injunction bond for $5000 were L. F.
Doolittle and Heber Ingle. The case will
be heard at once. It will not retard the
construction of the new system, which
was begun on Monday with a large force.
President Babcock of the Southern Cali
fornia Company says the injunctions
against the bonds will not stop him one
minute and that by the time the bonds are
needed the injunction suits will be dis
posed of. The friendly suit begun Mon
day has precedence over the suit brought
to-day, and if the parties to the first acree
to submit this one at once to the Supreme
Court, the San Diego Water Company can -
not prevent it. The charges of fraud and
bribery are indignantly denied by the elec
tion officers and by the Council.

teresting case against Police Justice Mor
rison was decided this forenoon by Judge
Smith of the Superior Court. Juotice
Morrison was charged with neglect, and
his removal from office demanded, be
cause he failed to send papers to the
County Clerk's office in an appeal case.
Judge Smith dismissed the action. He
said the accusation against the Justice
was in the nature of a penal charge, and
must be judged on tne same basis as a
criminal proceeding.
There was an absolute failure to show
any willful misconduct by JusticeMorrison
or anything approaching corruption. The
element so necessary to sustain such pro
ceeding â criminal intent â was entirely
lacking. To say that for a mere mistake,
not of far reaching consequence, the Justice
should be removed from office and fined
$500 seemed to him a monstrous proposi
tion. 1
ATTACKED BY A ROBBER.
Bold Assault Committed in the Hallway
'â  "' of a Saloon.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 30.â A bold
attempt at robbery was made this morning
in the rear of a salobn at the corner of j
Commercial and Wilmington streets. Tom
Martin, a railroad man, was walking along
Commercial street, between 5 and 6
o'clock, when he was approached by
George Davis, who remarked to Martin
that he was very thirsty. Martin replied
that he would not object to a "bracer," so
they repaired to the saloon.
Davis informed the railroader thai; he
was a miner in hard luck, and Martin
finally invited Davis to accompany him to
a restaurant on the opposite of the street.
They partook of a meal, and then re
turned to the saloon.
' Martin, upon entering the saloon, start
ed for a rear room. He was passing
through a narrow hallway, when Davis,
who had followed him, ordered him to
halt.
As he turned Davis se^ed him by the
throat and struck aim a heavy blow with
his clenched fist on tbe left eye. Martin,
who is a small man, defended himself as
best he could, but was no match for Davis,
who succeeded in snatching his watch
and chain. He then ran his hand into
Martin's pocket to relieve him of what
change he had, but on hearing some one
coming broke and ran.
Martin followed, yelline "Stop thief!"
Davis managed to elude his pursuer for
several blocks, but fortunately he ran into
Officer Johnson, who nabbed him just as
he was about to scale a fence in the rear
of a building on Wilmington street.

tion for a new trial was made in the Su
perior Court this morning in the case of
James McGinnis, convicted of manslaueh

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1896.
SANTA CRUZ TARS
MAN A MONITOR,
Naval Reserves Cruise Out
to Sea on the Fighting
Monadnock.
DRILL IN ROUGH WATER
High Waves Repeatedly Sweep
Over the Rakish Warship's
Low Deck.
AMATEUR SEAMEN KEPT BUSY
All Hands Startled by a Groundless
Cry of "Man Overboard!" When
Far From Land.
BANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 30.â The
Naval Reserves of this city learned to-day
something of a warship's discipline in a
cruise on the Monadnock, and they
learned also that it was not a mere outing
they were taking on the high seas, for the
thirty-three able seamen of the Fourth
Gun Division, N. G. C, had hardly
boarded the ship before they were ordered
to stow their rations and appear on tbe
forecastle to lend a hand in the weighing
of the anchor. There was not a second of
time to spare after they had saluted the
flag. But they went to their duty will
ingly, ard bore the labor of the day un
flinchingly. Of course, there was a good
deal of instruction that had merely to be
listened to and not put into actual demon
stration by imitation. That gave them a
respite from tha manual labor and an in
sight into the duties that devolve upon
enlisted men in the navy.
The bluejackets received them kindly
and readily gave them such information
as they asked when tha duty of the hour
was not upon them and made their stay
aboard ship as pleasant as possible. The
officers, in the strict line of duty, gave
their orders in courteous tones and kindly
suggestions.
The cruise began at 9 o'clock and lasted
eight hoursâ a day's work. It included a
run out of the bay direct to sea, thence
northerly up the coast for fifteen miles
and out to the high seas, where the waves
ran high over the lower deck of this fiat
looking vessel and occasionally washed the
upper deck. Once, indeed, did tbe briny
sweep so high and fall In such volume on
the upper deck that the cry of "Man
overboard !" rang through the ship. But
the "man overboard" did not go over,
though there wasn't a dry spot on him
when he shook himself free from the sud
den ducking he had received. This little
incident interested the naval reserves, who
were not so quick as the bluejackets to
perceive that the alarm was causeless.
After a few hours of running through a
heavy sea the Monadnock had reached a
point off Monterey and turned its nose
airain into the bay and headed for Santa
Cruz. All on board were surprised to find
the Philadelphia still lying to, as they had
suDposed the cruiser sailed for Monterey
at 4 o'clock, an hour and a half before the
MonadnocK was due in the harbor. The
Philadelphia, although having received
last night sailing orders that would have
put it into Monterey harbor this evening,
was ordered to await the arrival of six
cadets from Annapolis, who did not ar
rive to-night, but who are believed to have
gone direct from San Francisco to Del
Monte.
Both ships will sail for Monterey at 10
o'clock to-morrow morning, there to par
ticipate in tbe semi-centennial of the
raising of the American flag.

party lunched with the officer*, and a
pleasant farewell was said.

Smith repeatedly landed uppercuts and
red-hot swings on Lavacke's jaw and neck. ;
This he kept up all through. When time I

to go to San Luis Obispo. When found

ALASKA'S ERA
Of PROSPERITY,
Judge Hannum of Juneau
Says the Boom is
Growing.
WORK FOR THE MANY.
He Denies the Published Stories
of Suffering at the
Mines.
FAIR WAGES TO LABORERS.
Thoss Who Seek Employment Do Not
Go Hungryâ Growth of
Juaeau
PORTLAND, Ob., June 30.â Judge C. S.
[annum of Alaska, who arrived here to-
day from St. Louis en route home, says
that the great rush of immigration to
Alaska has been taken care of, and that
every man who has sought work has got it
at $3 50 per day, seven days a weet.
"The people of Alaska are doing well,"
remarked Mr. Hannum. "I do not con-
sider the prosperity they are experiencing
as a boom, but everybody is going to work
and making money. The merchants are
selling lots of goods, and, although it is
iate in the season now for newcomers to
the mines, there is something going on.
The activity in minine gives an impetus
to all trade. One hundred and sixty stamp
mills have been established very recently
within a radius of twenty-five miles of
Juneau. We have eight steamers a month
now at Juneau, and they all do an enor
mous trade with Tacoma and Seattle.
"I have read the stories of destitution
printed in different coast papers, and they
are all nonsense. I have not seen a man
ask for a meal or for help, and every labor
ing man at Juneau in search of something
to do got work. The mining camps want
men to work, but of course it is a little
late in the season for men to go up there,
as the mines are pretty well filled up. Re
cently some valuable new leads have been
discovered, and the industry is being ex
tended all the time.
"Houses can't be built fast enough in
Juneau, and a new building is scarcely on
its foundation until every inch of space is
contracted for. Part of the lumber comes
from Puget Sound, and the overcrowded
vessel on which I made the up passage
carried 14,000 feet of lumber on the deck
on the deck, mind you, for the hold was
so full you could not get your hat in it.
And such a fight for room ! People were
laid out all over the decks so you could
walk on them; that ia, if you cared to
risk the attempt.
"A word about the Indians of Alaska.
They are a race that is fast disappearing
and soon will be extinct. There are about
30,000 of them left. They are au indus
trious people. They are to the poople of
Alaska what the Chinamen are to Port
land. They do ail the slavish work. A? a
rule they have more money than the
ordinary laborer. They are peaceable and
well-disposed and are self-sustaining, ex
cepting tha local government schools,
which are established for their benefit.
"How about living in Juneau? Well, I
suppose it will cause surprise, but a man
can get board and lodging for $25 per
month, and it is good board and lodging
at that. So, you see, it is not as high as
you would suppose."

An Innocent Man Falls in. an Epileptic
Fit in Court.
PORTLAND, Ob., June There was
ah exciting scene in United States Judge
Bellineer's court to-day during the trial of
L. J. Marck, Postmaster at 2EUna, Jackson
County, on a charge of abstracting a reg
istered package from the mails. During
the argument of the . prosecution a lawyer
rose to a fervid pitch of eloquence. Marck,
the prisoner, sat with clenched hands and
rigid face, his very soul dwelling on the
burning words of the attorney.
"\Vhere was that package when it was
missed? Who had it?" the counsel
shouted.
Marck bad slowly risen from his seat as
the attorney, reached the issue of his guilt,
and as the words denouncing him came
from Lawyer Leusure's lips, with a pierc
ing shriek the prisoner threw his arms
into tne air. and, falling backward, lay
writhing and frothing in an epileptic fit.
The courtroom was. turned into a scene of
great confusion.
Marck was acquitted this . evening on
proof that an JEtna postman had received
and receipted for the package and sent it
on to the Trail Postmaster.
SEATTLE'S DIVORCE CASE
Dr. Dawson Tells of the Strange
Whims of a Jealous
Wife.
Declares That for a Long Time He
Believed Mrs. Dawson Was
Insane.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 30.â The plain
tiff's side in the Dawson case created a
sensation in Judge Hume's court to-day
when Dr. Dawson went onto the stand,
testified as to bis wife's jealousy and
swore that for a lone time he forgave her
because he believed that she was insane.
He told, also, of her attempt to commit
suicide.
From the time of their marriage, in
1888, Dr. Dawson said, Mrs. Dawson was
jealous of him, charged him with being
intimate with his lady patients and
threatened to shoot several of them. One
night, when Mrs. Dawson had been
making insinuations and Dr. Dawson had
threatened to leave the house, sne took a
revolver, placed it against her bead and
threatened to kill herself. She did the
same thing at another time, but on both
occasions Dr. Dawson snatched the re*
volver from her hands.
Ont. night Dr. Dawson received a pro
fessional call to another part of the city.
Mrs. Dawson did not want Him to go. He
said that he would have to. and as he
started toward the door Mrs. Dawson
called him back and said that she had
taken a large dose of morphine. He gave
her medical attention and afterward was
satisfied Mrs. Dawson had taken but a
small dose. After that Mrs. Dawson
would take morphine in small doses,
"simply to annoy him," he said.
Dr. Dawson found a letter addressed to
him one night in which Mrs. Dawson
urged him to give up his practice and go
to California, explaining that whenever
she aaw a revolver or a drug which would
prove fatal, if sufficient of it was taken,
she thouÃht of suicide. She feared she
would kill herself some day or go insane.
Dr. Dawson went to his bedroom and
talked ihe matter over with Mrs. Dawson.
She repeated what she had written. Dr.
Dawson believed she was insane and
talked to some of his colleagues about it.
They were of the belief that it was only
jealousy, bur expressed the oplnioD that
it might benefit Mrs. Dawson if he would
consent to leave the city. Later. Mrs.
Dawson thought that she" would just as
soon move to the family ranch in Mason
County.
That was in 1890. Dr. Dawson at that
time had a large practice, but he gays it
up and he and Mrs. Dawson, the children
and the nurse went to Mason County. A
neighbor wanted him to give professional
treatment to a member of his family. Dr.
Dawson consented and Mrs. Dawson was
very much incensed because he had gone.
She made the same old insinuations
against him.
General Carr, chief counsel for Dawson,
pleaded guilty in the Municipal Court to
day to righting. Sentence was suspended
until Friday, when bis antagonist, Co
respondent Esplin, who pleaded not guilty,
will be tried.
Love letters, not signed bat alleged to
have been written by Frank Carroll to
Mrs. Dawson, were read in evidence by Dr.
Uawson's counsel to-day.

affections of Mary Walters, better known
as Marie Fately, of Oakland, against Louis
Thannhauser, a prominent Front-street

State Circuit Court to-day, but after a
failure to secure a continuance the plain

claimed they could not get witnesses from
San Francisco in time to attend the trial,

Thannhauser, who was formerly in busi

MARK WEST ADVENTURE.
A Mad Bull Slain After Fatally Wound-
inn a Horse.
1 , SANTA ROriA, Cal., June 30.â J. H.
Freese of Mark West had a experience
with a mad bull last nierht that he is not
likely to soon forget. He was mounted on
a horse and leading the bull, which is or
dinarily quite tame. Suddenly the animal
charged at the horse, sinking his long
horns deep into the flesh.
Frepse dismounted rather hastily over
j his horse's head, and at once Bought safety
lin an adjacent house. Here he procured
j a rifle and hastened out to save, if possible,
the life of his valuable horse. The now
thoroughly maddened bull saw him com
ing, and at once charged straight at him.
Freese fired and t.e animal rolled over
dead, with a bullet in bis brain. The
horse was fatally wounded.

HORRIBLE CRIME
OF A YUMA GIRL,
Maria Moreno Kills Her
Brother After a
Quarrel.
ENRAGED AT A REBUKE.
Takes Deliberate Aim and Fires
Two Charges of Shot at
His Head.
BOTH LOADS TAK3 EFFECT.
The Murderess Becomes a Raving
Maniacâ Story of a Wayward
Career.
YUMA, Ariz., June 30.â Miss Maria
Moreno, 17 years old, shot and instantly
killed her fourteen-year-old brother here
this afternoon. The boy was chiding her,
and she became enraged and struck him.
He returned the blow with a shoe. Then
tue girl went into another room, soon re
turning with a .shotgun. She took delib
erate aim and pulled the trigger. Tbe
charge of shot carriea away the top of her
brother's *cad.
When the girl saw the fatal conse
quences of her awful actshe fell in a faint.
To-night she is a raving maniac, and it is
likely that she will be confined in an asy
lum at once.
It is said that in the lifetime of Miss
Moreno's father he had some trouble in
keeping his daughter from going astray.
Finally he became involved in a difficulty
with a man against whom he was en
deavoring to protect her honor and was
wounded. This wound caused his death
some months ago. Since then it has been
hard for her mother and young brother to
keep the girl within proper bounds.
Tbe brother, though younger than Miss
Maria, took upon himself considerable re
sponsibility, and this mornine; he chided
her for keeping company with one or two
objectionable men with whom she lately
attended several questionable dances, and
for otherwise improper deportment.
After blows had passed, the boy, wish
ing to avoid further trouble, turned and
walked away, but the girl, securing a shot
gun, stepped to the door and called him.
As be turned toward her she pulled the
trigger of botn barrels, both charges take
ing effect. He was thirty feet or mor
from her at the time.
It is believed tbe girl's mind has long
been weak. Several <imea she has at
tacked schoolchildren who were passing
and chased them with a butcher Knife.
She does nothing now but wring her hands
and cry.
CHEERED BY SACRAMENTANS.
Elks Give Secrete i a Brown a .Farcwuil
Ovation.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 30.âSecre
tary of State L. H. Brown was given a
parting ovation this evening when he
boarded a train for the East. The local
lodge of Elks with visiting brethren
headed by a band of music escorted the
Secretary of State and his wite to the
depot. As the train started the crowd
cheered and they continued until the
tourists were out of hearing.
Mr. Brown will go direct to Cineinnsti
to attend the meeting of the Grand Lodge
of Elks, which convenes on July 7. From
there he will visit Eastern points and all
State institutions en route.
The farewell greeting was an entire sur
prise to Secretary Brown, and, with the
exception of the Elks, entirely impromptu.
As soon as the train arrived in this city a
party of ladies invaded the Pullman sec
tion to be occupied by the secretary and
transformed it into h bower of roses.THE FIRST IS
ALL FOR BARHAM,
McKinley, Barham and
Prosperity Is the Slogan
There.
ALL RIVALS WITHDRAW
The Man With a Bright Record
Is Wanted by Fourteen
Counties.
THE BUSINESS QUICKLY DONE.
Barham Is Named by Acclamation by
the Repub icans of the First
Distr.ct
The re-election of J. A. Barham to Con
gress from the First District was yesterday
made one of the certainties of this cam
paign, as far as certainties may appear
amid the manifold exigencies of the issues
of 1896.
The Republicans of the First District
unanimously and enthusiastically named
him yesterday at their Congressional con
vention'as their candidate for Congress.
"McKinley and Barham, Protection and
Prosperity" will, during the ensuing cam
paign, be the slogan that will be most
loudly heard throughout fourteen counties
of this State and if there be a Congres
sional Districl in California in which Re
publican success is assured in advance
that district is the First.
In none of the seven Congressional dis
tricts of California has the Wilson-Gorman
tariff bill wreaked greater economic dis
aster and few other sections of the Golden
Etate present such pitiable examples of
the ruin wrought by Democratic free
trade policies or afford more potent argu
ments in favor of the Republican doctrine
of protection to American industries.
The First Congressional District, com
prising a vital portion of the wool, lumber,
iruit and wine industries of California,
which now lie prostrate as a re
sult of Democratic economic legislation,
yesterday declared ti.at protection was
the issue in California during the
campaign of 1896, and after a whoop for
McKinley ciieered the name of James A.
Barham of Santa Rosa, who will in that
section of the i;iatÂ« share this year the
support of every citizen who realizes the
disastrous results of Democratic rule, and
who has the plain, every-day sense to
realize what path leads to the remedy.
The name of Barham was the only one
mentioned in connection with the Con
gressional candidacy in that district at
the convention held at the rooms of the
Union League Club yesterday forenoon.
As told in Thk Call of yesterday Judee
Spencer of Lassen and Mattock of Tiha
ma withdrew from the race several days
ago. State Senator Frank McGowan of
Humbolt, the only remaining rival to
Barham, realized night before last that
Barham had a clear majority in his favor,
and his name was not presented to the
convention.
When the convention assembled at
10 a. m. there met as intelligent and repre
sentative a body of men as any party has
afforded in California. All knew whom
and what they wanted, the business was
Boon disposed of, and there was no boss
rule or wire-pulling in that convention
either. The nomination went to Barham
with unanimity and spontaneity.
A. B. Lemmon of Santa Rosa, chairman
of the Congressional committee of the
First District, which ordered the conven
tion, called it to order, saying in a few
words that besides the nomination of a
Congressman the convention might be
called upon to nominate a Presidential
elector, owing to an uncertainty about the
regularity of the nomination of Mr. Fran- ,
cis at the convention held in May.
T. L. Carotbers of Mendocino and D. D.
Dodson of Tehama became the chairman
and secretary of the convention.
Mr. Carothers, in accepting the chair,
recalled the fact that the district bad for
many years gone Democratic until it was
carried by Judge de Haven, and that 'it
had again gone Democratic until it was
carried by J. A. Barham.
When the committee on credentials,
composed of R. H. DirlinÂ»of Nairn, Robert
Nixon Jr. of Siskiyou, A. Putnam of Hum
bold t, G. N. Sturtevant of Mendocino and
J. W. Borrie of Trinity, had reported after
a recess the nomination of a Congressman
was proceeded with. . ' .V,
Barham was placed in nomination by
Frank L. Coombs of Napa, whose first
mention of Barnaul's name was greeted
with enthusiastic applause.
"He has not pleased all men," said
Coombs, "but he has so directed his course
that he comes back to us with a name; a
character and a record that give to us
more assurance of his future actions than
a thousand declarations and platforms."
Nixon of Siskiyou and then Cone of
Humboldt, the stronghold of McGowan,
seconded the nomination, and J. A. Bar
ham was nominated by acclamation amid
rousing cheers.
Barham was brought in from the vesti
bule, and he spoke a few brief . words in
expression of his thanks ana appreciation.
J. L. Childs of Del Norte offered the
following resolution, which was unani
mously adopted:
. w , HER The record of Hon. J.A. Barham
during his Congressional, career has been that
of an honest, upright and untiring champion
of the hts of the people of California and
thoroughly consistent with true Republican
ism: therefore, be it ,
~Â£ c l ol % d \ J hal we, the Congressional dele
ft \ ifnrii' First Congressional District of

< i?Â«J L ![t t , c obsessional District of Call

esteem and support of all his constituents/
On motion of a. G. Meyers G. M. Francis
was unanimously nominated as Presiden
tial elector for the First District.
Coombs brought up the doubtful ques
tion of how and when, under the purity of
election Jaws, the Congressional Finance
Committee should be appointed, and it was
decided that the convention and the Con
gressional Committee should both appoint
the same committee. The result was the
joint appointment of the following com
mittee: I. W. Ragsdale, A. B. L rumon.
Santa Rosa; W . A. Mackinder. Nana- A
W. Hill, Humboldt; D. D.' Dodson
Tehama. . '
On motion of Senator Gleaves 'of Shasta
the Congressional Committee was au
thorized to rill vacancies, and then, after a
vote of thanks to the Union League Club
for the use of its rooms, there was an ad

McKinley and Barham; ,

The revolutionists, it is said, have al

SETBACK TO COMMERCE.
Why a Japanese Steamship Line
Has Not Been Established
to This City.
WAITING FOR ENCOURAGEMENT
Suitable Arrangements Could Not Be
Made With the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Collis P. Hintington has now added to
his unenviable lecord the distinction of
having driven from this port a proposed
line of steaners to and from Yokohama.
If he has not done this personally he is at
least responsible for it, for to the inability
of the projectors of this tranc-Pacific line
to secure a suitable arrangement with the
Southern lacific Company for through
Eastern freight is due toe failure to estab
lish this importantm portant enterprise.
Rumors iave been current for several
months that the Usen Kaisha, the largest
and wealthiest steamship company in
Japan, witli lines plying to ail ports of
Asia and Europe, was about to make a
connectioi. with one of the Pacific ports of
the United States, Portland, Tacoma,
San Diegc and San Francisco were each
mentioned as the possible terminus on
this side <>f the ocean, but up to date the
project Ikis shown no real signs of exist
ence so ar as the general public is con
cerned.
Broad hints have come from apparently
reliable sources that the matter was in
contemplation, but facts were unobtain
able. Recently these rumors have boen
revived Â«vith more vigor than ever. The
Japanese Consul, Sabura Koya, went so
far as to say be had learned of the project
being in contemplation by the l T sen
Kaisha through the Japanese papers, but
heretofore would have nothing further of
a committal nature to say on the subject.
In the course of an interview ysterday,
however, he inadvertently disclosed the
secret of why the proposed new Yoko
homa-San Francisco line is not a fait
accompli.
lit- stated that about six months ago the
Japanese corporation made an investiga
tion of the situation on this side of the
Pacific, and decided that San Francisco
was the best, and in fact the only port for
it to make connection with. Accordingly
negotiations were were opened with the
Southern Pacific Company, lcokinn to an
arrangement whereby the proposed line
would be given the same advantages so
far as through freight for the Kast is con
cerned as are enjoyed by the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company and the Occidental
and Oriental Steamship Company.
But no satisfactory agreement could be
reached, tot a surprising result when it is
considered that C. P. Huntincton. the
president of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, is also in control of the two steam
ship companies to which the proposed new
line would be a powerful competitor.
Discouraged in this direction, the Usen
Kaisha turned its attention Englandwurd
and established a line via the Suez canal
from Yokahoma. A fleet of six steamers
was put on about half a year auo, and ad
vices just received by the Japanese Consul
state that this fleet has now been increased
to an even dozen vessels, with every indi
cation that additional vessels will be re
quired in the near future.
It has been further learned that this
corporation is still ready to come to San
Francisco, and wiil do so as soon as it re
ceives the desired and necessary encour
agement.
GOING OVER ESTIMATES,
The Grand Jury Trying to
Reduce the Tax
Levy.
Heads of Municipal Departments Sub
mit Statements of Ex
pense.
The Grand Jury has finally resolved to
consider no more criminal cases â in fact
nothing else than the municipal estimates j
will be discussed. It was thought that '
some consideration would be given last |
evening to the suggestions that Mrs. I
Nettie Craven should retire froia the
School Department, but the jury has de- ]
cided to refer this suggestion and all other
complaints of a personal character to the
next Grand Jury,
A resolution was adopted at the session
last Friday which instructed the jury com
mittee on municipal departments to ob
tain from the head of each department a
list of men employed, the salary paid to
each and a statement of expenses for the
past year, together with an estimate of
forthcoming requirements. The resolu
tion also requested the heads of depart
ment? desiring an increase in the allow
ance to state what reasons existed for de
manding an increased sum of nionev'.
Last night the jury heard Harry Piper,
chief deputy of the County Clerk; V. F.
Northrop of the probate department. Dr.
Luvelace, Health Officer, and Mr. God
chaux, secretary of the Board of Health.
J. B. Reinstein, legal adviser of the
Health Board, also attended, bui owing
to the lateness of the hour he was not
called into the jury-room.
Diligent inquiry was made by the Grand
Jury to ascertain Â»f the number of clerks
in the County Clerk's officeâeighty
fourâcould not be reduced without detri
ment to the service, but Messrs. Curry
and Northrop insisted that all of the men
on the payroll were authorized by law
and were necessary to perform the work
which the law required of the office. The
jurors seemed to adhere to the opinion
that a reduction in the force might be ef
fected.
The representatives of the Board of
Health sought to convince the jury that a
larger appropriation was needed for food
inspection.
The Grand Jury is determined to go
ahead in the consideration of estimates,
and if the inquiry results in ascertaining
where proposed allowances are extrava
gant a vigorous remonstrance will be made
to the Board of Supervisors against per
mittinc the extravagance. It is well un
derstood that the Finance Committee of the
Supervisors has the estimates under re
view at present, but the Grand Jury ex
pects to be ready to report the result of
observations before the board finally
passes upon the allowances.
Another session of the Grand Jury will
be held to-morrow evening. Then the
Assessor will be able to state the valua
tion of property for purposes of taxation.
It is predicted that the valuation will ex
ceed $340,000,000. Should the assessment
reach this ligure the tax for local pur
poses should not exceed $1 10.
COONEY IS OUT OF TOWN.
An Important Witness in the Matter of
the Craven Deeds.
James J. Cooney, the notary, before
whom James G. Fair is said to have ac
knowledged the deeds by which he trans
ferred the Pine and Mission streets prop
erties to Nettie R. Craven, left the City on
Saturday and had not returned yesterday.
It could not be learned just where he had
gone nor exactly when he would return,
and this fact caused some speculation
among parties interested in the suit.
It is for Mr. Cooney to say whether or
not James Q. Fair came before him per
sonally and acknowledged those deeds â
that is, it is for him to say it in court. He
has already .said so out of court and his
acknowledgment is written on the deed.
The presence or absence, therefore, of
Mr. Cooney is not considered vital for the
attorneys for Mrs. Craven-. "The docu
ments speak for themselves," they say.
"They say that James G. Fair wentoefore
Mr. Cooney and acknowledged these
deeds. This is the best evidence."
The Fair will just discovered to the pub
lic in British Columbia bears a date that
materially interferes with any disposition
it might have to impinge upon the current
controversy. It was executed away back
a year before Senator Fair's death.
It is interesting, however, as throwing a
side light upon the Senator's state of mind
with regard to his children and heirs.
"Why should he take the trouble to go
to British Columbia, buy land and stocks
in order to be domiciled under the law,
and there make and leave for probate his
will?"
"Because he had reason to believe his
will would be contested. Probated in a
foreign country it cannot be contested in
this country. In British Columbia or in
any British court it is a very diflicult un
dertaKing to break a wiil. Only the
strongest evidence will do it. Given in
charge of Chief Justice â then Attorney-
General of the Province â Darie, it would
j have been next to impossible to do it. Oh,
I it was a very good plan for securing the
integrity of liis will."
Tho question was so answered by a law
yer well acquainted with Mr. Fair and
his affairs before his death.
"But after all this precaution Mr. Fair
made another will and other wills after
ward and Jeft them in this country subject
to the very dangers he so much feared?"
"Oh, yes. He changed his mind, it
seems, and could not go away up there to
make the changes. The result is as he
feared it would be. This much is certain,
however: That Mr. Fair went up to
British Columbia for the purpose of mak
ing a will, made it and left
it in the hands of the leading lawyerof the
I provinceâ now Chief Justice. It can have
no effect, however, except the wills now
offered for probate shall be invalidated by
decree of the court."
"Do you know the provisions of the
British Columbia will?"
"I do, but I am not at liberty to say."
Mrs. Craven is still kept close to her
home by illness. The hearing will be be

HE REMEMBERED THE GAS
C. J. Miller Commits Suicide,
but Pays fcr Its
Agent.
He Left His Landlady One Dollar to
Remunerate Her tor the Waste
of Deadly Fluid.
Driven to the last ditch by a long run of
hard luck, C. J. Miller, a barber, quietly
turned on the gas in his room at 229
Kearny street, yesterday morning, and
then disrobing stretched himself across
the bed and awaited death's summons, it
came. Just when, nobody knows, but his
body, cold and stiff, was found in room 30,
by Officer Burnett, about 11:30 o'clock.
Whatever Miller might have been in
Mfe â that is, his contact with ;the hurly-
C J. Miller, Who Paid for the Gas
Which Kndcd Ilis Life.
burly worJd â his last few hours on earth
showed that he possessed a peculiar re
gard for the financial welfare of those
with whom he came in direct contact.
The last dollar he had on earth went to
pay for the ga=< which finally extinguished
liis life. For his landlady he left the fol
lowng pathetic note:
Sunday, June 28, 1896.
Mr*. Fchulz, Landlady: I em very sorry, but
it is done. 1 leave $1 for gasâ the last one I
nave on earth. Too much hard luck. I nave
tried to keep up, but everything goes against
me. I would rather be dead. My few little
things I have in this room you can keep what
you want or give them to the .Tap. Landlady,
please mail the two letters I leave. Miller.
It is evident from the above that Miller
had contemplated the desperate deed for
several days. The note was written on
Sunday, but his couratre either failed him
or he hoped, like Micawber, that by wait
ing a day or two something micht turn
up. If there is any truth in the old adage
about "the ruling passion strong in
death," then the barber was an honest if
unfortunate man. In addition to the let
ler left for Mrs. Schulz there were two
others, one for Miss Rebecca Hening, 703
Stockton street, and a second for Robert
Driceback. 200 Market strict.
Miller had at one time worked for
Driceback in the shop owned by the latter.
During the last few months he drank
heavily, and some weeks ago was forced
to give up his position. In consequence
of this he grew despondent, finally spend
ing the last doliar he had for gaa with
which to end a miserable existence.
Ocean View Improvement*
The Ocean View Improvement Club met
last Sunday evening at Taylor's Hall and
voted in favor of the establishing of a hi^h
school for the Mission district. After a
spirited discussion it was also unanimously
decided that the Club co-operate heartly with
the other Improvement clubs of the district in
securing red, or other rock equally as good,
at such figures as will allow the property
owners to have their grading done at a reason
able price.
While the improvement of their property
was looked aft"-r, the intellectual welfare of the
residents of the district was Dot neglected.
To this end a resolution was- parsed favoring
the opening of a branch free library In tliis
section of the City. The delegates to tnÂ» asso
ciation of improvement clubs are: M. F. Taylor,
David Hughes, William C. Fisher, Louis Ishim
and J. R. Blancbard. The roll of the club was
increaÃed by a large number of signatures.
The club will meet again next Sunday night at
8 o'clock at the same place.
STRATHMONT WAS SPEEDY
Outpaced a Large Field of Green
Ones and Took a Low
Mark.
DRIVER ALBERTSON IN TROUBLE
After Losing One H?at the Three-
Year-Old Event Proved Easy
Game for Claudius.
The attendance at Ingleside track yes
terday to witness the second aay's trotting
and pacing events decided under the
auspices of the Pacific Coast Trotting
borse Breeders' Association was fair, and
the character of the sport furnished war
ranted a much larger crowd. The card
was not a lengthy one, a 2:40 pace and a
stake for thr.e-year-olds making up the
programme; hut so stubbornly contested
was the pacing event that night was draw
ing nigh as the crowd left the course.
Ladies' day on Saturday proved so popu
lar that the osiociation decided yesterday
to allow the fair sex to pass through tt.e
turnstile without charge during the bal
ance of the week.
The strong breeze from the ocean again
proved a great detriment to fast time.
While the horses went down the back
stretch as though speeding down a tobog
gan slide, they tired perceptibly as they
made the tack into the homestretch and
had the wind aeaint>t them.
The bell tapped the ten starters in the
2:40 pace out first, and inStrathmont, who
finally proved the victor, about as good a
preen horse as has been seen around in
this section for some time, was uncovered.
A horse with no record that can step a
heat in 2:Vi\t^ on a track considered at least
four seconds slow to the mile would cer
tainly do to co bushwhacking with. The
Fresno County horse's party made a sÂ»ad
mess of the whole affair, however, and as
a consequence Driver J. R. Albertson finds
himself ruled off the turf for a period of
two years.
so strongly touted was Slrathmont that
in the opening pools sold he brought $1.0
against $6 for Kate II and $3 for the field.
A disastrous break at the first turn ruined
his chance for the opening heal and he
finished up eighth. Meridian, againsc
which the books laid 15 to 1, jogged in
very comfortably in 2:20, with Adele sec
ond and FJoraline third. The closing
pools on the second heat were: Meridian
$10, Strathmont $10 and the field $o.
Agnin the Fresno horse finished eighth,
i Meridian placing another heat to his
crtdit in 2:23^, with Kate H, who came
like a streak, second, a neck away. Pools
now sold : Meridian $10, the field' $7. The
judges apparently did not fancy Albert
! son's efforts in the sulky behind Stratti
rnont, and when the horses came out to
score he was removed and Jim Dustin sub
stituted.
The change worked wonders. Dnstin
| gained the pole at the first turn with his
I horse and he kicked dust in the faces of
,the field the balance of thÂ« journey, pass
ing the stand two lengths in advance of
Kate H in 2:16K- Meridian, outpaced
from the jump, finished fifth. There was
now another shift in the betting, Strath
mont bringing $10, with the field going at
$3. The lavorite went in the air turning
into the back stretch and lost several
lengths. When finally settled down to
work he made up a deal of lost ground,
but could not catch Kate H, who won the
heat by five lengths in 2:25. There was no
pronounced change in the betting, and the
fifth heat found Stratbmont himself again.
Securing the pole at; the first turn, he
paced the mile without a skip, finishing
! five lengths before the game Kate 11 in
2:24. All now went to the stable but
Strathmont, Kate H and Meridian, having
failed to take a heat of the rive decided.
There was no betting and Strathmont,
never pressed, took the heat and ran as he
pleased, leading Kate Hout two lengths
I t02:23&
The trotting stake for three-year-olds
I vas something in the. nature of a gift
for Claudius after the Palo Al'o stock
farm entry, Hunyadi, had taken the first
heat. In the auction betting Claudius
went for $10, with Hunyadi bringing $8
and the field $. Don Roberto and the
first choice both broke at the first turn in
the opening heat, and Hunyadi, who ap
peared to be a very level-headed sort of a
youngster, placed the heat to his credit in
2:26J^. Claudius, who was second, fin
ished so strong that after the heat he was
a hotter choice than ever. The following
three heats went to him without effort in
2:28. 2:28% and 2:29. Second money went
to Hunvadi, who finished second in the
deciding heat.

PRICKLY HEAT.
Tory proved a most expensive one, for, be
sider ruling Driver Aibertson off for two
years, the judges decided to take ad
vantage of ti;e rule, and allowed James
Dustin, who drove the horse in the last
four heats, 50 per cent of the purse. Iv
connection with the ruling the point was
raised by the friends of Air. Albertson that
the decision was void, as A. H. Cohen, ono
of the judges officiating in the stand, is in
eligible to occupy that position, as his
name appears on the suspended list of the
National Trotting Association. This ques
tion will be decided at a meeting of the
local association.

CALL IT A GREAT STATE.
That Is the Decision of the
Visiting Civil Engi
neers.
Metcalf's Resolutions That Only the
Numerical Population Is Small
Are Indorsed.
The closing meeting of the twenty
eighth annual convention of the American
Society of Civil Engineers was called to
order last night in the assembly hall of
the Academy of Sciences by Joseph M.
Knap.
The only purpose of the meeting, as
scheduled, was to bear the annual address
of President Thomas Curtis Clarke.
That gentleman being absent, and, as
the chairman stated, "somewhere in New
York or its environments," the printed
address was read.
William Metcalf closed the meeting with
a few pleasant words regarding the State
in which the organization had been so
pleasantly entertained. He aaade com
parisons showing the vast amount of ter
ritory in California, which is equal to the
area of half a dozen Eastern States, and
concluded by saying th3t "with all this
vastness, which is in keeping with the
products of the soil and the hospitable
temperament of the people, the popula
tion was small. In feet," emphasized the
speaker, "this is the only small thing so
far apparent in California."
The following resolutions were pre
sented :
Resolved, That California is great and that
the wtiole Pacific slope is greater.
Resolved, That the products of her soil are
groat anrt nor people are much greater.
Renolvtd. That her flowers and fruits are lus
ciousau<i beautiful Â«tr.d her women excel them
all so greatly that we must say they are most
beautiful and lovely beyond compare.
Rcsotv'd, That m find ourselves unable to
express ourselves and, therefore, we give it up
and consign ourselves without further thought
to the inexpressible delights of our visit.
Mr. Metcalf called for a vote, which,
from the volume of "ayes," sounded as a
unanimous expression, and then called for
the "noes," supplementing the call with
the admonition that if there were any
they had better retire.
The delegates to the convention will be
treated to an inside view of the fortifica
tions of the Presidio this morning.

ATTAR OF ROSES.
The Firrt Shipment to This City Is
Seized for Duty.
There seems to be a perturbed state in
the mind of Collector John H. Wise
in the matter of the duty on attar of
roses. The schedule aa made out by the
Government for the collection of duty on
this article ia litely to mix up almost any
one for the reason that this particular lux
ury may be taxed or not according to the
way one looks at it.
Attar of roses is acknowledged to be an
essential oil which should pay 25 per cent
ad valorem duty. Yet the Wilson act pro
vides that attar of roses must be admitted
free of duty. Hence the conflict.
Thore never has been much of this per
fume imported iuto America via San
Francisco, this being probably the first
experience. As a rule it has come via
New York. It cost all the way from $3 to
$23 per ounce.
M. B. Mehran of this City had some of
it shipped to him from Constantinople,
and the customs have prevented it laud
ing without the 25 per cent ad valorem
duty.
.Attorney J. F. Evans, for the importer,
has entered a protest, and the matter
must now come up before the board of
general appraisers in New York for de
cision.

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EJECTION NOVEMBER 3. 189Â«-
The Pattison boom has evidently been
pat in cold storage.
About the only thing Grover declines is
a request to decline.
Democracy Knows not what to do, where
to go nor whom to follow.
Free trade is the bucket which Dem
ocracy is getting ready to kick this year.
Now is the time to cultivate the Fourth
of July enthusiasm and make ready for
the great day.
The ring in McKinley' s speech of ac
ceptance was the kind that takes in the
whole country.
Now that fishing seems to be the only
pursuit open to him, Cleveland has lost
his taste for it.
After you have provided for your own
registration see to it that all your Repub
lican friends do likewise.
Altgeld pardoned the anarchists, but
would he pardon the Chicago convention
if it broke away from him?
In the great circus of the campaign
Democracy will be the worst demoralized
trick mule ever seen in any ring.
The Republican party is known as the
party of prosperity and there is a good
campaign argument in that fact alone.
If there is anything can cool the tem
perature of Chicago next week it will be
the frigidity that prevails between Bland
and Boies.
For a man who recently declared he was
not a candidate lor the Presidency, Mr.
Boies seems to be fighting very hard for a
nomination.
Whitney has pointed out what he calls a
safe path for a Democratic candidate to
follow this year, but he is not willing to
walk it himself.
Mr. Huntington is now aware that Cali
fornia is camping on his trail and he can
never carry out his funding scheme with
out a hard fight.
It will be a benefit for Democracy to cut
loose from Tammany ana Wall street,
even if it does not gain a vote in the West
to make up for ie
Now that we have made a thorough ex
periment of free trade in wool, ask the
wool-grower what he thinks of it and how
be ia going to vote.
Democracy cannot find a leader, but if
she wishes a Comptroller after her own
heart she has choice of Eckels and Bowler,
and the pair would make a ticket.
The business interests of the country are
on the side of the Republican party and
that is the reason why all men of business
sense are going to vote for McKinley.
People in the interior who wish to
recreate themselves witn ocean air and
patriotic enthusiasm should come to tbe
City and help us celebrate the Glorious
fourth.
Harrity has appeared in public several
times of late without the Pattiaon boom
and it begins to look as if the Pennsylva
nia Democrats had decided to draw out of
the game and play solitaire.
Benator Palmer has discovered au old
Illinois farmer Democrat who says he is
going to "winter his vote" this year, but
he would do better to put it in the sun
shine by casting it for McKinley.
The assurance of a speedy and perma
nent return to the protective system has
put everybody in a good humor and the
campaign will be a good deal like a Na
tional festival when the bands begin to
play.
When we have revived our industries so
that capital can find profits and labor can
obtain wages, it will be easy to promote
the re-establishment of bimetallism, and
the Republican party can be counted on
to do it.
One of the significant features of the
campaign is the rapidity with which the
ripple caused by the free silver bolt at St.
Louis is subsiding. In a little while people
wno talk about Teller, Dubois and Cannon
may have to explain who they are and
what they have been doing.
Senator Thurston uttered the general
sentiment of all loyal hearts when he said
to MeKinlev : "Your nomination means
on indorsement of your heroic youth,
your fruitful years of arduon* public ser
vice, your sterling patriotism, your stal
wart Americanism, your Christian char
acter and the purity of your private life.
In all these things you are the typical
American, for all these things you are the
chosen leader of the people."
OFFENSIVE PARTISANSHIP.
It is difficult for an intelligent Ameri
can to believe that Cleveland hns any
serious idea of seeking a renomination
from the Chicago convention. Every sign
of the times and every aspect of the sitna
ation combine to show that such an idea
would be so foolish and futile that even
the most besotted office-seeker could
hardly entertain it so long as he retained
a fair degree of political common-3ense. In
spite of all this, however, there are not
lacking evidences that Cleveland does
really cherish some idea of this kind and
is not in any way backward about working
to carry it out.
Tne strongest evidence of this Cleveland
lunacy is to be found in the activity dis
played by Federal office-holders in their
efforts to obtain power in the Chicago
convention. Having been beaten in
nearly all the Democratic State conven
tions, the administration forces have
not lost hope. They see in the prevailing
corJusion in the party a chance to split
tlje National Convention and obtain for
Cleveland a renomination from tne gold
bug faction. A great crowd of Federal
officials will be on hand at Chicago when
the convention opens, and quite a number
are already there. They are fighting nomi
nally for the gold standard, but it is not
difficult to see whom they wish to nomi
nate on that platform.
It will be remembered that Cleveland
when posing as a civil service reformer
issued an order forbidding Federal officials
to display what he called '"offensive parti
sanship." .Perhaps he does not consider
the partisan activity of his officials to be
offensive. The work done by Daggett in
this State and by men in similar positions
in other States is, however, to the popular
mind and to the common-sense view about
as offensive partisanship as political bosses
who are also office-holders can be guilty
of. Cleveland, however, approves it all.
Official after official leaves his duties at
Washington and hastens to the place
where he can do most to help in making
something like a Cleveland victory at
Cnicago, and the great hypocrite of civil
service reform sees it all and secretly en
courages it. He has told his followers
that "a cause worth fighting for is worth
righting for to the end," and in this con
test he is setting the example of using all
the power of official patronage to obtain a
renomination lor himself or make it
worthless for any one else.
WITHOUT A FRIEND.
The people are unconsciously adminis
tering a telling rebuke to the Democratic
party. Ever since the first struggle for
tbe Presidency, dull times, or rather a
slacking off of business activity, has been
the rule in Presidential years. When the
struggle was between the Whig and Demo
cratic parties people neglected business to
participate in the campaign, but, aside
from that, there was nothing to prevent
the usual flow of transactions. When the
Democratic party got in line after the war
to renew its fight for supremacy, business
of all kinds grew inactive and hesitating
about one-haif of the year in which the
National election occurred, but it was be
cause of a suspicion that by some strange
change the Democracy might win. Dur
ing the campaign of 1876 business was at
a standstill because of the fear that the
country might fall under Democratic rule,
and in every subsequent campaign mana
gers of business enterprises gathered their
affairs well in hand. In fact, for twenty
years the business world has dreaded the
Presidential year because of the necessity
of the withdrawal of every iron from the
tire, so to speak.
But this Presidential year â especially
since the St. Louis conventionâ the dispo
sition has been to plunge into new enter
prises and enlarge old ones. Every line of
business feels that it can expand and be
safe, and capital is looking about for em
ployment. In fact the world of trade and
traffic seems to have forpotten that this
is a Presidential year. There are two
reasons for this. Commerce feels that
Democratic methods and policies have run
their course, and th*y are no more to be
feared. Tbe Su Louis convention pledged
the Republican party to apply certain
economic principles in the conduct of the
affairs of the Government which will give
commerce and all lines of industry ex
actly the encouragement and protection
they need. And 6O the businessdnterests
of the country are paying no more atten
tion to what the Democracy may or may
not do than if it were not on earth. In
fact, no line of trade is interested enough
in the Democracy to inquire -when the
funeral will take place. They know it is
powerless to injure them again, and that
is enough.
REPUBLICAN CLUBS.
The call has bean issued for a National
Convention of Republican clubs to be held
at Milwaukee, beginning August 25, and
all the clubs of the party in California
should make preparations to be repre
sented at it by strong and earnest delega
tions. The convention is to be composed
of two delegates at large from each State.
two from each Congressional district in
which there are one or more Republi
can clubc, and the president and secretary
of each State League.
A. W. Kinney of Los Angeles, president
of the California State League, has re
cently issued an address urging Republi
can clubs throughout the State .to organ
ize district leagues according to the Na
tional plan. In the course of his address
he lays especial emphasis upon the need
of such action by the clubs of the Fourth
and Fifth Congressional districts. Such
urging ought not to be necessary at this
stage of the campaign. All Republican
clubs of San Francisco should co-operate
heartily with the National League and
help to give California a strong represen
tation at the Milwaukee convention. We
must put our State in the list -f those that
stand for patriotism, protection and pros
perity, and the way to do it is to organize
ana work toeether from the start.
HILL'S COLLAPSE.
In the burly burly of the forefront of
the Democratic battle, where the contest
between the gold faction and the silver
faction rages fiercest, one form is missed,
one leader is lost, one mighty champion
strikes no blow, and friend and foe alike
wait in vain to see the coming of his wav
ing plume or to bear the sound of a iarring
blast upon his bugle horn.
No part of all the strange medley of
Democratic politics this year is stranger
than the almost complete elimination of
David Bennett Hill from the coun
sels and the strifes of hia party.
His collapte has been even more
complete than that of Cleveland. Four
years ago he, with his Tammany
braves, went down in the convention
fiercely fighting, but this year he can
hardly be said to be in the ring. He will
be at Chicago, of course, but he will
hardly be accounted a leader on either
side. He will stand with the Democracy
of New York, but he will stand in the
â¢hadow of Whitney, discredited and no
longer capable of rousing enthusiasm by
declaring. "I am a Democrat!"
Hill's thoughts of the situation and of
TIIE SAN FfIAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1896.
his position in it can hardly be pleasant.
But for a lack of Courage on his own part
he n.ight; to-day have been the idol of his
party and had the Presidential nomina
tion by an almost unanimous voice of New
York and the West and tbe Bourn. A few
ypnrs ago he made a speech at Elmira,
taking advanced ground for the free
coinage of silver. Had lie stood by
that speech and defied the powers
of Wall street and Tammany he
would assuredly have been defeated for
the Senate, but he would have been in
reasonable distance of the Presidency
now. He is another warning to those
politicians who sacrifice conviction to ex
pediency. He stands in marked contrast
to McKinley, who was true to the great
principle of protection even in its hour of
defeat, and the people who delight in true
manhood will turn from the discomfited
politician to give their highest honors to
the steadfast statesman who is true at
once to himself, his country and the ever
lasting right.
BOIES AND WHITNEY.
In his reply to Mr. Whitney Mr. Boies
falls very far short of what should be ex
pected of a man who aspires to the Presi
dency. But Mr. Boies labors under the
disadvantage of not knowing much about
the Democracy. Until a few j-ears ago he
was an uncompromising Republican, and
since he went over to the opposition his
time has been occupied for the most part
in seeking office. Then, again, He does
not seem to be able to grasp the money
question. To be sure, he is trying to get
the Chicago nomination on the money
issue, but he does not appear to know how
great tbe difference is between silver
monometallism and bimetallism, and in
drifting from one to the other he does not
touch a point in Mr. Whitney's letter.
Mr. Whitney is a representative bimetal
lic Democrat. He favors a monetary sys
tem based upon gold and silver dollars.
In that he is a good Republican. For
that matter, the money plank of Demo
cratic platforms for nearly forty years has
been taken from tbe Republican party's
declarations, and all sensible Democrats
still adhere to it. When Mr. Boies tells
Mr. Whitney that the Democratic party
wants such legislation as will establish
silver monometallism he only amutea ben
sible men of all parties. The Wnitney
wing of the Democratic party is standing
upon the St. Louis platform as to the
money question, and, no doubt, all that
following will vote for McKinley. Mr.
McKinley stands for tound and perma
nent redemption money which shall in
clude gold and silver upon the basis of
parity. There is no difference of opinion
among business men anywhere on that
question.
The burden of Mr. Whitney's letter was
fora bimetallic currency, but Mr. Boies
talks about something quite different,
hence he does not answer tbe New York
gentleman at all. In this, however, there
is great harmony between Boies and Whit- |
ney. Neither one of tl:em can be induced
to refer to the tariff question. They are
in accord on the proposition that no wing
of the party could afford to permit that to
be an issue. But Mr. Boies cannot divert
public attention wholly from the tariff to
the money question, and he certainly can
not interest the people in his scheme to
make silver the standard dollar and gold
a thing to be ignored. However, Boies
changes his mind so often on the money
question that it is just possible that he
may project an entirely new proposition
before the convention meets. Mr. Boies
is a nice old eentleman, and will do for a
"big man" at his home in Waterloo, but
out in the big world of politics he is lost,
and when Tammany reaches Chicago he
wUI be amazed to know what a very small
hole he can crawl into.
A CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION,
Chairman Hanna of the National Com
mittee favors an educational campaign
upon the broadest lines possible. There
are others, however, who cling to the old
"still-hunt" fashion, but the people do
not want it that way. An educational cam
paign would be a very wise thing. There
has been so much said and written about the
failure of the Wilson-Gorman tariff act to
provide sufficient revenue to maintain the
Government, and also that it has caused
the suspension of so many of our Indus
trie-, it would be well to give the facts
and figures in detail. In a general way
the people know that the administration
of Cleveland is an utter failure, but they
ao not know where all the weak spots are
located. They should have full informa
tion concerning the result of the tariff act
of 1890 and the act now in operation, not
only for their benefit in this campaign, but
for all time to come.
There never was a better opportunity to
educate the people in political economy.
They are deeply interested and they want
to know more of why protection is helpful
and free trade is injurious to their interests.
As the tariff question is the leading issue,
and as the country's prosperity is
dependent upon t'e enactment of laws
that shall protect from laborer to the most
extensive industrial plant, it is proper and
right that the Republican party should
supply the people all needed information
concerning the importance of protection
to them.
"THE WEEKLY CALL."
Every newspaper has a duty to perform
in addition to its mission a? a medium of
news. No land can prosper which does
not progress, and in order that the way to
prosperity may be paved it is necessary
that the resources of the country be devel
oped. To this end The Weekly Call de
votes considerable space to the gathering
of data tending to broaden and develop
agriculture, horticulture and all kindred
interests. The result of the experiments
being carried on in the soverai States at
the agricultural stations are shorn of tech
nical and tiresome detail and placed be
fore our readers in a practical manner.
Developments in cold-mining are also re
ported, and in fact, improvements and re
sources of every kind are searched out and
described.
The news department is not neglected,
telegraphic reports from the world around
Deing printed in every issue. There are
also departments devotad to the markets,
the fraternal orders, music, politics and
questions of the hour.
The Weekly Call which appears to-day
is unusually interesting, and may be had
at the business office, in wrappers ready
for mailing, at 5 cents per copy.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
O. B. Stanton, who, until June 1, was one of
the proprietors oi the Baldwin Hotel, came to
town yesterday from Ker:i County, where he
is part owner of several promising mines that
have very recently attracted considerable
notice.
But that is not why Mr. Stanton smiles. He
has struck a great flow of artesian water on
the Mojave desert. It was all the more pleas
ing to him because he was not expecting any
thing of the kind. Now he wonders If his con
nection with the hotel resulted in his becoming
the unconscious possessor of the charm that in
other days gave the great breach-of-promlse
man his title of Lucky Baldwin.
"Tho well," said Mr. Stanton, as he stool
before the Baldwin bar and sipped leisurely at
O. B. Stanton, Who Has Struck Artesian Water in the Mojave Desert.
a refreshing beverage, "is near Koehn post
office, twenty-seven miles north oi Mojave, on
the old Searles borax road to Death Valley."
"Is it in the desert?" was asked.
"Desert nothing! I'm tired of hearing that
country called a desert. It's just like the San
Joaquin, and the climate is a darnea sight
better.
"Where we struck the flow, the land is
covered with little knolls on a country
gradually rising toward the mouutains. All
about those mounds there was a little surface
seepage, and I thought that by digging reser
voirs at intervals along the elope the water
might be causjht so that it could be pumped
when needed from the different reservoirs.
The first hole, however, was the last. The idea
was to cut them six feet square and twenty
feet deep. Well, when the men got down about
eighteen or nineteen !eet, the bottom burst
right up, and the water poured in so fast that
they had to get out in a hurry. In less than
forty minutes the reserroir was overflowing.
"There is plenty of water for 100 stamps if
necessary. Tne flow is six inches. The well
ia on C. A. Koehn's homestead, but I have the
privilege of using the water, and it is the only
flowing water in the whole region.
"We are using the water now for our mill,
only 250 feet distant. There are mines all
about there. The Ked Rock is four miles to
the west; that's where they found that big
nugget a little while ago. Eleven miles to the
eaet is the old Golder district, and thirteen
miles to the southwest is the Randsburg dis
trict. The output of all these mines is limited
to-day to the very richest ores, which alone
can be profitably handled, the rate for trans
portation is 80 high.
"We are putting in oil tanks, and will use
petroleum for fuel, so, with that innovation
and the artesian water, conditions are some
what improved.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
OUR POLITICAL PROBLEMS.
Solutions Peopobed by Lecky and the Re-
fcslican Party.
To the Editor cf the San Praneinco Callâ Sir:
Mr. John McNaught is fairly entitled to the
thanks of all thoughtful readers of The Call,
numbered as I believe by tens of thousands,
for his contribution in Sunday's issue on
Lecky's "Democracy and Liberty," a history
of our own time. Mr. Lecky has no living
superior in historical work except John Clarke
Ridpatb. Both are masters, but Rldpath
moves with his age and interprets it with his
face to the future, while Leckyâ with equal
ability and attainments, with as good a con
science and as fair a mind, noting and placing
all recordable facts which encage alike the
alert attention of Kidpathâ interprets the ago
out of sympathy with it and regrets the trend
and spirit of it.
Mr. McNaught gives us a a brief but search,
ing and full-grasping iudieial review of this
important book, and while many were at
church this morning seeking inspiration for a
better and higher life, as was my own assidu
ous cu.-tom until recent years, I sat reading
the review of this timely book and meditating
on the problems whtcb it stales with so much
ability, and for which, as the reviewer tells us,
he fluds n partial solution at least "in a
limited form of tne referendum," even for
England. "He would allow an appeal to
society at large in order to save society from
the representatives of its lower eh-uients,"
according to our reviewer, who regards such a
safeguard as "strange," fcince Mr. Lecky favors
the ilamiltouiii.il theory of "a strong "govern
ment" of v monarchical type, and not the gov
ernment of pure democracy, as held by Jeffer
son, and so ably and zealously defended by
Rldpath. Indeed, Mr. Lecky pronounces
Hamilton "the greatest politicnl thinker
America has produced," and claims that
"he never concealed his preferences for mon
archical institutions," and "believed that
democratic government would end in dcs-
Cotism," a view which many think Is shared
y President Cleveland since his conceded
alliance with the predatory gold barons,
known as the money power, who are at pres
ent in control of the Government, and who to
ream that control now dominate the great
newspapers, the telegraphic news agencies,
the commercial bodies, the churches, the re
ligious press, the farmers' journals, the maga
zines, the universities and colleges.
While meditating on theao things and try
ing to realize what is certain to befall our
country unless a great change comes soou my
mind reverted to a powerful plea mude l>y
Benjamin G. Wright, five columns lone, in the
mii Francisco Bulletin of Saturday, June 20,
in behalf of the policy set forth in the Repub
lican platform recently adopted at St. Louis
for the management of our Government and
the promotion of the general welfare. Mr.
Wright merits the compliment I i>ay him in
saying that he has made the ablest plea I have
â een in favor oi the gold standard of values,
and I will add that my copy of it is covered
with blue pencil marks for convenient refer
ence. Perhaps I may claim that I am a some
what competent judae of ins plea, since I am
a close reader of a score of dally newspapers,
besides weeklies and magazines, most of which
advocate the views so forcibly presented by
Mr. Wright; but the one declaration to which
my mind reverted with much solicitude will
be found at the close of his paper, "the con
clusion of the whole matter," winch is stated
in these plain terms:
"The triumph ot the Republican party next
November will inaugurate a new era of the
most prolonged and the highest type of pros
perity which this country has ever witnessed.
The triumph of sound money will unlock
European vaults of the idle gold now there to
the general revival of industries throughout
the United States. Foreign capitalists will
wait the outcome of the pending general elec
tion with anxious hope
"If the result of the election proclaims that
the people are for money the equal of that to
be found anywhere, we shall find a friendly
and liDeral ally in Great Britain to neln in the
development and prosperity of this country.
Money is a drug iv Europf, The banks there
are teeming with idle gold. Give the owners
of this id.c money the assurance thai they
will benald back in money of equal value mid
the wheels of commerce will revolve with old
tiine prosperity."
Presumably Mr. Wright is an American. Pos
sibly his ancestors took part In tfte War of In
dependence and helned establish the Amen
can Nation, "free and independent." Now he
bids us vote to assure the owners oi British
gold that we will pay them back ingoldsnd
we can secure their help in the development
and prosperity of this country. We pay back
that which we borrow. But how shnll we bor
row it? With our securities? Yes? Good as
gold, are they ?
Better than gold, eh, becauss gold is "Idle,"
and "securities" carry interest? Our credit is
still good, then, if it is better than the bank
ers' gold in England, even if we have sunk a
nation so low in our own estimation as to be
dependent for money to start the wheels of
commerce to revolving with old-time prosper
ity upon the pjold which we can borrow of
these British bankers if we will vote for the
gold .standard. Both my paternai and mater
nal ancestors fought in the Revolutionary
War in Virginia and the Carolinas, and I wa6
made a Republican in my native State of Illi
nois in my youth by Abraham Lincoln's con
versation and speeches, so I confess that my
indignation burns ;as I contemplate Mr.
Wright's abject dependence on English gold.
As a Lincoly Republican I scorn hia plea. I
prefer American independence, although I
may have to use full legal tender paper money
made by my own Government instead of Brit
ish gold, and *yen if it stays at home and is
not "the equal of that to be found anywhere"
in Europe. Paper money made the Nation in
the war for independence and saved it under
Lincoln in the late Rebellion.
But let me ask this simple question: If our
credit is bette' than British gold, will buy it,
and the gold owners prefer it, way not coin
it into good Government paper money and
use it a; home? If our credit, to put it in an
other way, is so good when It is impaired by
bearing interest payable in gold, why is ft
not good as a basis for paper money, full legal
tender money, when it bears no interest?
Perhaps Mr. Wright does not know how
much English gold Is now invested in Ameri
can securities. The New York World recently
gave a list of twenty-two classes of invest
ments, with the amount in each. I have not
room tor it here, but tne sum total is $3,193,
-500,000 âover three thousand million dollars,
every dollar of it drawing a pold tribute in
the form of interest from this country, amount
ing at 4 per c.ni to $127,740,000 a year, and
yet he pleads with me to vote his ticket to bor
row more gold and pay more interest.
I suspect that Mr. Wright did not hope to
win any votes for his party, but only to hold as
many us he could In it.

SILVER FLUCTUATIONS.
John P. Irish Quotes Its Relative Valpeb
to Wheat in Reply to Nelson.
To tne Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir :
Your correspondent, Henry Kelson, says
that silver now at 67 cents an ounce will buy
as much wheat as when it was $1 29 an ounce.
Wheat is quoted in New York at about 67
cents a bushel; so an ounce of silver buys a
bushel of wheat.
Silver wns $1 29 and above per ounce from
1833 to 1873, and wheat during that time
fluctuated between 95 cents and $2 46 per
bushel.
Mr. Nelson asks when was silver known to
fluctuate in price prior to 1873?
In the forty years between 1833 and 1873
silver fluctuated in price just thirty-nine
times, dodging hack aud forth bi tween the
extremes of $1 '29 and $136 per ounce. Very
truly, John P. Irish.

MR. McKINLEY ACKNOWLEDGES A
PROMISE.
Cleveland Plain Dealer.
PITTBBURG, June 21.â A ptrty of Pittebur*
men, warm frieuds ot Major McKlnley, spent
most of last week in Canton. They returned
home to-day aud tell Â» story of a meeting be
tween old college chums, the revival of a
promise given by McKinley when a boy study
ing law at Poland, Ohio. *
Among the first to hasten to congratulate
â¢Billy, do you remember a promise you
said 16 : Presideailttl candidate laughed : and
liv e8; d ? T Â» Oa , COI 5^ to claim Its fulfillment?"
'^o. not at all That promise wÂ«s â¢ canceled
long ago. I came to congratulate you. You
can t say that you never promised a man a
job when you got to be President, though."
Later the story of the afl'air came out. Mc-
Kinley and Arrell were students together, and
one day Arrell solved a difficult legal prob em
for MeKinlev. The Canton lad said : "Thanks,
old man. When I get to be President I'll
make you Chief Justice."
Arrell never gave the matter another
thought until many years had passed aud he
was a Judge himself and hnd married a daugh
ter of ex-Governor Tod of Ohio. McKinley
was becoming famous, and then frequently in
jest, when they would meet, Arrell wouid re
mind McKinley that he must hurry up and be
come President, as he wanted that appoint
ment.
ENTERPRISING AND RELIABLE.
Translated from tbe Arauto.
My most sincere thanks to The Call, one of
the most serious and important dailies of San
Francisco and the one that, 1 am told, is the
most read by the Portuguese of this State,
especially of Alameda County. Indeed Ths
Call, putting aside its kindness for the
Arauto, is the paper that the Portuguese
ought to read, because it is one of the few
papers that respect us and give us due con
sideration. Not long ago, in the list of San
Francisco papers that tried to insult us, there
was not The Call. Last week durintr the two
conventions, the St. Louis and Sacramento,
The Call was the best informer and it was the
first read in Sacramento, taking for that pur
pose a special tr&in. Labt week yet the Chron
icle gave us the news of the death of Hintze
Ribeiro, which wm false, while The Call gave
us the sad but tiue news of Thomaz Ribeiro's
death.
SILVER QUESTION IN KENTUCKY
Pittsburg Dispatch.
The silver question, as it is understood in
some parts of Kentucky, is graphically illus
trated by a letter which one of the statesmen
at the capital received from a correspondent
in that State. It appears from the epistolary
evidence that a controversy was being waged
between a sound-money man and a silver
champion. The gold man thought he had the
best of tbe argument, lie asked his adversary
why he thought the free coinage of silver
would make times better.
"Simply because it would cut more money
in circulation," said the champion of the white
metal.
"But how will it put more money in circula
tion ?" demanded the gold man.
"How?" asked the silver man, with a smile
of contempt at his opponent. "How? Why,
you blamed fool, if you can take one gold dol
lar to the treasury and get sixteen dollars fur
it, won't that increase the circulation?"

LONG PASSAGES
NOW IN VOGUE,
Many Vessels of the Over
due Fleet Are Com
ing In.
ALDEN BESSE THE LAST.
It Took Her Thirty-Five Days
to Make the Run From
Honolulu.
ALL DELAYED BY HEAD WINDS.
Narrow Escape of Captain Johnson of
the Steam Schooner
Sc tia.
Long passages are not uncommon, but
the South Sea Island fleet has broken the
record. Barks, barkentines, brigs and
schooners that have made the run in from
eleven to fourteen days have on thia oc
casion been out all the way from three
weeks to a month and a half. Ai: tell the
same tale, "light winds and calm," and in
many cases tae vessels ran out ot provi
sions and others more fully supplied had to
help them out.
Of tne overdue fleet tbe Andrew Welch
made the best run. She came here from
Hawaii in twenty-three days. The Mo
hican was twenty-eight, the clipper
schooner Murial twenty-six, the Lurline
thirty, the Archer twenty-eight, Annie
Johnson thirty-seven, Aloha thirty-four,
Jennie Wand thirty-one and the Alden
Bease thirty -five days.
Apart from these it took tbe Tropic Bird
forty-four days to get here from Tahiti,
while the average passage is less than a
month.
The vessels due from Australia, from
the Orient and from Europe are all mak
ing long passages, ami, like the sugar
; fleet, are probably delayed outside. The
City of Philadelphia, now out 150 days
from New York, is posted as missing and
60 per cent reinsurnnce is paid on her.
The Undaunted is 160 days out from Balti
more, Ederbank 164 days from Antwerp,
F. S. Ciamoa 132 lroni Caraiff. Cumbus
kenneth 158 from Hamburg, Blackbra> s
161 from Liverpool, Ravenscourt 138 from
London, and Latham 140 from Swansea.
Many of these vessels have been in
more or less trouble, so the long voyages
cannot be wholly attributed to adverse
winds. For instance, the Blackbraes was
j compelled to return on account of the
weather; then she was in collision, and
I finally last May she put into Montevideo
leaking and with he** rudder damaged,
while the Wederland had to put into Port
> Stanley with ncr cargo shifted. She also
j lost many of her sails, the rigging '.vas
damaged, and in order to save the ship
considerable of the cargo had to be
| jettisoned.
Of all tbe vessels that have made long
runs that of the Alden Besae has been lbs
most exasperating. When Captain Pottef
was making his adieus to Captain WiÂ«
liams of the W. G. Irwin, he said: "Good
by, old man; I'll be on the wharf to nieet
you in San Francisco." The Irwin has
been in port six days and has not ou'.y
discharged but is now loading for Hono
-1 lulu. Captain Potter had more than his
i share of head winds, however, so it is no
fault of the vessel that she did not make
better time.
On the 20th inst. the monotony of daily
life on the bark was broken. The British
ship Clackmannanshire hove in sight, and
j the signal "short of provisions" was
hoisted. The Britisher was bound for At
j toria and was clean out of fresh-canned
meats. The vessel had called in at
Pitcairn Island and there had obtained
a supply of vegetables, but these did not
last long, and when the AJden Besse hove
: in sight the crew was on "short allow
ance." Captain Potter was well-provi
sioned, and he willingly gave the Britisher
all the supplies be required.
Anent the loss of the bark John Baizley
the Bulletin has this to say :
Ships, like cats, often have nine lives. The
bark John Baizley, that one year ago lay
at section 3 of the seawall of this City, i- a
vessel that has been abandoned more tl.an
once, but when she went ashore at Macuo,
south of Hongkong, some weeks ago, it was
thought in nautical circles that she was
wrecked for all time. But the Baizley doe^ not
die so easily. On the afternoon of May 29 she
came into Hongkong harbor, towed by a mite
oi a tug, looking as ii she had iiiterfere'l \rith
the progress of a typhoon. She was minus
copper sheathing, sails and run ninj gear, for
the pirates of Macao had sacked her like a
Cuban town, leaving nothing but her hull and
cargo. The latter-being hardwoods from India,
wa> too heavy and awkward to carry. The
galley stove, however, was neither too hot nor
: too hefty to discourage the rot)berÂ§, and that,
| too, went with the rest of the booty secured by
j the marauders.
The Harbor Commissioners !et the rs
pa'ring of dredger No. 2 to John Twiggs 4
Son yesterday. The meeting of the board
was short, as Commissioner Chadbourne
had an engagement to meet S. S. Green
Jr.. Chief Engineer of the Department of
Docks of New York. When the El Capi
[ tan got in from the excursion around the
bay with the civil engineers Mr. Green
was taken in charge hy Colonel Chad

POISONED BY LAUDANUM.
It. G. Dormsn, a Collector, Found Dy
ing on the Street.
A man about 50 years of age was found
dying on the sidewalk at Sixteenth and
Sanchez streets last night. As it was sup
posed, he was drunk he was taken in the
patrol wagon to the Seventeenth-street
station.
Alter being in the station for a few min
utes, Corporal Heggerty saw that the man
was in a comatose condition, and a boitle,
marked "laudanum," about naif empty,
which was found in bis pockets, led him
to suspect that the man had poisoned
himself. He was sent to the Receiving
Hospital, and Dr. Fitzgibbon expressed
the opinion that he could not live many
hours.
From papers found in tbe man's pockets
he is supposed to be R. G. Dorman, a col

The comine Home Industry Exposition
to be held in the Pavilion this fall was the
principal subject discussed at the regular
meeting of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association yesterday. There were
: present Directors McLaughlin, Bowers,
Currier. Crccker, Keller, Mead, Kerr,
Manager Tacy and Assistant Secretary
I Dingle.
S. H. Tacy, wuo is actively engaged with
the special committee in working with the
The Association's Silk Badge for Those
fledged to Home Industries.
directors of the Mechanics' Institute in
arranging for the coming fair, presented
the following report, which was adopted:
Inasmuch as it is expected that the forth
coming "Home Products Exposition" to be
held in September next will attract wide
spread attention and be very largely attended
it will afford this association an excellent op
portunity to do a great deal of good mission
ary work among the people for the cause of
home industries, and in order that full advan
tage may be taken of the event I would sug
gest to your board that arrangements be made
for the erection oi a booth In the Pavilion to
be maintained and known as the headquarters
of the Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion of California. It should be about 10x12
feet in size and be erected in an attractive and
pleasing style, with the California trademark
in electric lights displayed over it. It should
be fully supplied with literature pertaining to
the subject of "Keeping the Money at Home,"
and also provided with silk badges for the la
dies signing a pledge to give the preference to
articles of California manufacture or produc
tion. An attendant should be there at all times
to receive the pledges and see to the distribu
tion of the bailees and literature.
Over one thousand pledges were signed and
badges distributed at the Oakland Exposition,
and it is my opinion that fully ten thousand
pledges would be signed at this exposition. If
the result would Drove as satisfactory here as
it did at Oakland the benefit that would ac
crue to our members would amply repay the
outlay it would entail.
Manager Tacy dwelt particularly upon
the importance of having a small booth
for the association's headquarters, and he
said it is surprising how enthusiastic tne
public in general and the women in parti
cular become in such movements. The
distribution of badges to the ladies who
agree to patronize home products was a
taking feature in the AlameJa County
Exposition and it should be here. Mr.
Tacy presented a beautiful badge of orange
colored silk, to be given away, which was
adopted. The obligation of those who
receive these souvenirs reads as follows:
"No community is prosperous whose people
are not employed." I hereby pledge myself,
price and quality permitting, to give the
preference to articles of California manufac
ture or production in everything that I pur
chase or use, and will endeavor to induce
others to do likewise, and thus assist home
industry. (Name, address, date, etc.)
By purchasing articles of home production
you assist in the employment of home labor.
Keeping the money at home means prosperity
to the community in which you live, your
neighbor and yourself as well.
It is expected that many thousands of
these pledges will be taken at the exposi
tion.
The matter of making rules to govern
the issuance of the new association's trade
mark was discussed and laid over for con
sideration at a special meeting.
In response to a communication from
! the Alameda County Home Product Expo-
I sition committee the association passed
! the following resolution:
Whereas, The citizens of Alameda County,
State of California, are about to hold a home
industry exhibition of manufactures and
products of A'umeda County, similar to the
one held in that county last year, but on a
much larger scale; aud whereas, the exhibi
tion of 1895 has proven to be of incalculable
benefit to the people of said county; and ]
whereas, the holding of such exhibitions is di- j
rectly in line with the work being prosecuted
by this association; and wherpas it is the be
lief of this association that such exhibitions
must of necessity be productive of much good
to the manufacturer* and producers of the en
tire State; be it therefore
Bt*o;ved, By the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association of California that the Oak
land Exposition is deserving of encourage
ment and support; and be it further
Resolved. That this association extends to the
Oakland Exposition it* hearty congratulations
for its success in the past, and Its wishes that
the same or a greater measure of success will
att end its present and future efforts in the
same direction; and be it futher
Resolved, That this association offers to the
I management of the Oakland Exposition auy
I and every assistance that may be in its power.

BANK FORGERY
AS A HIGH ART,
A Jury in Judge Wallace's
Court to Try Creegan
and Becker.
PROSECUTION'S THEORY.
Graphic Outline of the Secretive
Course Pursued by the Sus
pected Criminals.
STRONG EFFORT TO CONVICT.
Attorney Dunn Objects to T. V. Cator's
Testimony as to Becker's
Former Record.
The work of securing a jury to try Cree
gan and Becker, charged with the Nevada
Bant forgery, was begun and ended yes
terday in Judge Wallace's court.
In the forenoon eight jurors were ob
tained, and in the afternoon when eleven
men had been accepted the original panel
was exhausted, and the court bad to take
a recess until the Sheriff got a trial jury,
from which the twelfth man was soon
selected. Following are the twelve men
who will decide the guilt or innocence of
the defendants: Joseph I. Twohig, Milton
Lambeth, Michael Flood, W. Y. Kellogg,
Charles Wollpert, Julius E. Klemm, E.
W. Scott, W. Hobson, W. E. Balcom,
Harry Heacock, W. W. Dooiittle and H.
C. Bennett.
The Assistant District Attorney, in his
opening remarks, went over the main
facts of the case and outlined the proof he
would offer.
"We will show," he began, "that a
conspiracy to commit this forgery was
hatched at New York in November, 1894,
and that by this conspiracy A. H. Dean
was to come to California and select a
bank upon which to pass a raised note.
Creegan suggested that Dean first open an
account with some bank, and that later he
(Creegan) would come on to California
with Becker, an expert forger, who was
known variously as 'Scratch' aud 'The
Dutchman.' Creegan also made arrange
ments with another of the gang, Joe Mc-
Cluskey, t i meet him in this City.
"Dean opened an account with the Ne
vada Bank,'' continued the District Attor
ney, "on December 4, 1895. He went to
Woodland and bought from the Woodland
Bank a check for $12 on the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank. On his way back Dean un
expectedly met Creegan on the boat and
gave him the $12 check, which Creegan
raised to $22,000 and returned to Dean a
few days late r. He deposited tbe check to
his credii in the Nevada Bank. Two days
later ue withdrew $20,000 from the San
Francisco bank in gold done ud in four
Mint sacks.
"Dean and McCluskey divided the
money between tnem ttnd then both left
for the East, Dean going a day later than
McClusKey because as he was on his way to
the ferry with him he met the cashier of
the Nevada Bank and feared that he was
looking for him.
"Creegan and Dean met later in New
York by means of personal advertise
ments in the New York Herald. When,
shortly afterward, Creegan and Becker
were arrested in Philadelphia a number of
new $20 pieces, bearing the mark of tbe
San Francisco mint, were found among
their baggage.
In Becker's trunks was also found a
complete forger's outfit, which he claimed
he intended to use to alter playing cards
in connection with a gambling house he
intended to open in South Africa. As soon
as he was released by the Philadelphia au
thorities, however, he threw this forger's
outfit into the Schuylkill River.
"All this," concluded the District Attor
ney, "we will prove beyond the peradven
ture of a doubt. We will establish a con
vincing chain of facts proving that these
two men are at the bottom of this whole
forcing scheme, and w*> will accordingly
ask you to render a verdict of guilty."
Thomas V. Cator was the first witness
called. He knew Becker and had seer,
him in New York in 1878 or 1879. Attor
ney Dunn objected to tne District Attor
ney's question as to whether Becker had
admitted to Cator that he had been
engaged in a forcerv, on the ground
that anything that be saia bud hap
pened eighteen years ago was not
admissible in evidence. Judge Wallace
sustained Attorney Dunn's objection and
witness Cator was allowed to depart.
Belore adjournment Attorney Dunn
made a demand upon the prosecution to
produce certain documents in their pos
session, including statements made by A.
H. Dean, Joe McCluskey or Wiley Lytle
to Captain Lees. The court then ad
journed until 10 o'clock this morning.
A letter has been received by F. J. Le
Breton, President of tt:e French Savings
and Loan Society of this City, from Joseph
C. Hendrix, Chairman of the Executive
Council of tbe American Bankers' Asso
ciation in New York, urging him to take
energetic steps against the forgers now on
trial. In the letter Chairman Hendrix
says:
"The association has been at heavy ex
pense in this matter, and it has spared no
efforts, realizing that this is probably the
most dangerous gang of forgers in the
world. It is to the interest of all banks
that they should be thoroughly prosecuted
and, if possible, convicted and imprisoned
fora long time."

BEAUTY WEDS
WITH SCIENCE,
Marriage of Prof. Hengstler
and Miss Helen
Andros.
THE BRIDE IS A BELLE.
The Groom Is a Professor of
Mathematics and Juris
prudence.
A UNIVERSITY CLUB SUPPER.
Bridesmaids Attired in Dainty Pink
Gowns Escort the Bride to
the Altar.
Professor Hengstler, professor of mathe
matics in the State University and of
jurisprudence at tbe Hastings Law Col
lege, yesterday laid aside all intricate law
and mathematical problems for the more
alluring one of matrimony.
At 8 o'clock last cv ning, Rev. Dr. Steb
bins read the service which united the
learned gentleman and Miss Helen Milton
Andros, a prominent belle and beauty.
Long before the hour announced for the
ceremony, the church was crowded with a
large and fashionable assemblage. The
out-of-town contingent was well repre
sented. Heads grown gray in the pursuit
of scientific lore, mingled with the sci
ence of the future and the exponents of
fashion.
Pink hydrangeas and potted palms were
effectively used in decorating chancel and
altar.
As the City clocks chimed tbe hour of 8,
tbe strains of the bridal march announced
the coming of the bridal party.
From the door to the left of the chancel
advanced the ushers, Messrs. Hubert
Mcc, John S. Merrill, George Whipple and
Clarence Doane, followed by the brides
maids, Miss Gertrude Church, Miss Mary
Eyres, Miss Elisabeth Sanderson and Miss
Elizabeth Moffatt. The ushers, walking two
abreast, followed by the maids, proceeded
half-way down the main aisle. Here they
parted, lining up on either 6ide, thus form
ing a guard of honor for the handsome
young bride, who marched slowly to the
altar, preceded by her maid of honor,
Miss Blanche Baldwin, and followed by
her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Milton Andros.
The happy groom, attended by his best
man, Professor Clarence Cory, met his
bride at the altar.
Tne sown of the bride was elegant, yet
simple. It was fashioned of white crystal
silk. The jupe was cut demi-train and
was destitute of any trimming. The cor
sase was rut square in the neck and filled
in with a yoke of white crepe lisse laid in
tiny tucks. A wreath, composed of sprays
of lilies of the valley, confined the bridal
veil to the coiffure. The bridal bouquet
was composed of bride's roses.
Miss Baldwin, the maid of honor, wore
a modish gown of pink satin, tne corsage
of which was elaborately trimmed with
mdeacent passementerie.
The bridesmaids were attired alike in
dainty gowns of pinJc organdie over pink
silk. Three accordion-pleated ruffles fin
ished off the hem of the full skirt. The
square cut n*eck was outlined with a
bertha of accordion-pleated organdie and
finished off with knots of pink satin rib
bons. The young ladies carried bouquets
of pink carnations tied with long ends of
tulie.
After the ceremony the bridal party,
Mr. JÂ»nd Mrs. Andros and Rev. Dr. and
Mrs. Stebbins, were driven to the Univer
sity Club, where an elaborate supper was
served.
Professor and Mrs. Hengstler will pass
their honeymoon at Lake Tahoe and on
their return will take up their residence
at Berkeley.
The many friends of Colonel Thomas
McGregor and family, who, while stationed
here at the Presidio post a few years ago
entertained most royally, will be interested
to hear of the wedding of their second
daughter, Miss Apnes. The colonel is now
stationed at Fort Meade, S. D.
The wedding of Miss Agnes McGregor
and Captain Paul Shillock, assistant sur
geon U. S. A., was celebrated on the 10th
of June at tne Chapel at Fort Meade. Arch
deacon Ware of Deadwood performed the
ceremony. The bride was attended by
Miss McGregor, Miss "Wells, Miss Editn
Wells, Miss Goodwin, Miss Fountain and
Miss Ellis, wno officiated as bridesmaids.
Lieutenant .1. T. Crabbs was best man.
Miss Jean Davidson of this City was
pillow- bearer. Cnptain and Mrs. Shillock

with obtaining money by false pretenses. The
complaining witness is J. Stein, a dairyman at

In view of the approaching celebration
â >f the fiftieth anniversary of the conquest

vill be observed at Monterey on the 7th of

"ity, on the 9th of the same month, in

3uena, it may be interesting to many to
enow that there is resident in this City a
rent grandson of Rear-Admiral John
Drake Sloat, who in the name of the
LTnited States took possession of the
;ountry.
His name is James Bayard Whittemore
It. He resides at 916^ Oak street, is a

mve had an interest in the preparations

elics that 'had at one time belonged to
heir grandfather, with the idea of having
uch placed in the cornerstone of the
r.onument that is to be erected to the
nemory of J. D. Sloat and in honor of the
reat event his act on the 7th of July, 1846,
narks in the history of this State.
The ladies, however, were not as suc
:tb 3 ful as they expected they would be,
or when they made inquiries they discov
â¢red that all or nearly all had disappeared.
Phey did succeed in securing a picture of
heir grandfather a3 a civilian, and

ueces of wood from the British frigate
Jacedonian, captured by Sloat, then sail
ng-master of the United States frigate
Jnlted States. In a letter to their nephew
he ladies write:
Imiral John Drake Sloat, we wisl

ured by our grandfather, a history of which
ccompanits it. That, you might read aloud,
I permitted, as we are both anxious that you
houla have r voice in the proceedings. We
egret our inability to be present.
The history of the desk referred to in
he letter is as follows:
This desi was madÂ© on board of the United
'tates frigate United States for Lieutenant
ohn Drake Sloat from material collected on
/oard of the British frigate Macedonian, Cap
ain Carden, immediately after her capture on
he 23th of November, 1812, by the frigate
'nited States, commanded by Commodore
Stephen Decatur. The mahogany is a part of
l .bureau which belonged to one of the lieuten
ints of the captured ship, who broke it in
lieces to prevent its being nsoful to the cap
ain, declaring that "the Yankees should not
lave it." The ebony is of the sextant belong
ug to another of the officers, who destroyed it
or the same reason. The oak was taken from
l plank which had several shotholes in it. It
ormed a part of the aide of the Macedonian,
["he Bilver clamps and plate were made from
ome of the silver dollars received by Lieuten
int Bloat as prize money for the capture of the
hip. The desk was afterward presented to
tfiss Abby Gordon, who became Sloat' s wife
>n the 27th day of November, 1814.
John d. Sloat.
Mrs. Sloat, on this anniversary of her birth,
he;6th of November, 1859, delivers this desk
o her daughter Jeannette, the wife of John
tlcKeon, in trust for her granddaughter, Mary
Inn McKeon. Mrs. Sloat, now the wife of
'ommodore John D. Sloat, attained the age of
>4 years this dey. Abby Sloat.
The attention of Major E. A. Sherman
vas called some time since to the fact that
roung Whittemore was in this City, and
ie intimated that he would make arrange
nents to have him take part in the pro
:eedings of the day at Monterey, but the
jrogramrae of that event, as printed,

Should the great-grandson not be in

16M. John Drake Sloat, who be- i t
came rear-admiral, was born in Goshen, â  \
Orange County, N. "Â¥., in 1780. He I i
was the posthumous son of Captain i <
John Sloat, who was accidentally shot by ]
a sentinel in Rockland County shortly be- i
fore the close of the War of Independence, j <
After the death of her husband Mrs
Sloat, who was a Miss Drake at the time :
of her marriage, removed to Goshen, !
where the future hero of Monterey was j
born. She, however, did not long survive j
her husband, and her sou was taken care j n
of by her parents. His grandfather Drake j j
gave him such education as the schools of {
the time provided and instilled into his
mind the necessity of becoming an active
ana useiui man. >vnen .^u years ot age i
SlnÂ»t went In Wnehlnrrfnn - inn^hl on in' I
terview with President Jonn Adams and !
without much parley Cold him that he
wanted to be appointed a midshipman in
the United States uavy. The oft-handed E
manner in which he made the demand so \
impressed the President with the idea that c
the youth would make a good one at sea
that he had him appointed a midshipman â¢
on the 12;h of February of that year. He t
was ordered to the frigate President, un- '
der Commander Truxton. Then he *
served under that strict disciplinarian,
Commander Chauncey, and from him \
learned much that was of service to him
in the future. In 1801, when President '
Thomas Jefferson, for reasons of economy, '
reduced the naval force, young Sloat took ,
a furlough, ilia grandfather Drake nay- j
Ing died, left him quite a fortune, includ
ing a dozen slaves, but being opposed to |
slavery he immediately gave them their j
freedom. He then disposed of his recently j
acquired property and took command of a i ,
merchant vessel, which did not prove a :
successful venture.
The war of 1812 with England forced
him out of business, and be accepted the '
offer of Commndnrp DppiHiir in mak-o him
sailing master of the frieate United State
with a promise of rising in the ranks. On | c
the 25th of October. 1812, he managed, by t
skillful maneuvering, to get into close | '
quarters with the first-class frigate Mace- *
donian, and captured her. During the \
action he was wounded in the face, but re- <
mained at his post. For this capture he l
was promoted to the position of lieutenant, <
!
was publicly thanked by Congress and
voted a medal. It was after that
shortly
that he married Miss Abby, the daughter 4
of James Gordon, a prominent merchant <
of Norwich. After the close of the war, <
he took command of the schooner Transit J
and loaded with merchandise for France.
He was at Nantz when the great Napo- j
leon's power came to an end, and it bad i
been arranged that the little caporal was 1
to be placed on his vessel and taken t.n tim I
United States, but the whole nlan fell h
through by reason of the indecision of '
some of the friends of Napoleon, and the â 
once conqueror of the world was forced to '
surrender to the British squadron.
After that he served as first lieutenant ]
on the Franklin and from 1820 to 1822 he
was first lieutenant on the frigate Congress, I
which ob one occasion lay in the port ol
La Guayra when an earthquake occurred i
and a tidal wave drove twenty-three yes- I i
sels on shore. Commodore "RliiH 1*Â» wna r>n I 1
shore at the time and Lieutenant 81oat, 1
who was m charge, managed the frigate in '
such a manner that she was saved. After <
the blow was over Commodore Biddle I
came on board and paid a high compli- i
ment to the lieutenant for his manage- 1
ment of the vessel. After that Sloat took 1
command of the Grampus, and while sail
ing in West Indian waters captured the !
pirate ship Palmyra, and when off Bt. I (
Thomas, with his men, saved that town i
from destruction by fire. The people In I
recognition of the service rendered sub-
Bcribed a large purse which was offered '
him, but he declined it. After that he was ]
master commander and went on a cruise j (
on the Pacific in the St. Louis. In 1837 he j
was promoted post captain, then the high- ]
est position in the navy, and took charge
of Portsmouth Navy - yard, remaining |
there until 1844, during which time he I
superintended the rebuilding of the frigate 1
Congress.
He was then placed la charge of tbe
Pacific squadron, and it was while in that '
position that he, took possession of Call- I <

smbly district club of the Thirtieth Dis-
The socialists long ago determined to
nter politics as a party this year, and
nuch of their efforts for months past has
een directed to this end. The plan was
o begin in the districts south of Market
treet, where the laboring element pre
ominates and where the roots of social
!tn have secured a strong hold in the soil
f discontented society.'
The meeting last evening was held at
70 Folsora street, at the headquarter* of
he Jewish Branch fof the Socialist Labor
>arty. State Organizer E.T. Kingsley
alicd the meeting to order and explained
?hat was expected to be accomplished.
Ie spoke of similar small gatherings that
fere held in the various countries of
Europe a few years ago, and how they
ad increased in size and number until
he socialists were represented in the hals
f state. He spoke of the progress the
>arty had made in this country, and urged
is hearers to carry on the work.
Nearly thirty people signed the roll,
nd the club, when permanently organ
ted, will be known as the Thirtieth As- ,
embly District Branch. The following
ilicers were elected : William Edlin, cor
es-ponding secretary;- William Lewis,
mancial secretary; B. Gold and D. Rat
ier, . librarians. To-morrow night the
'hirty-second Assembly District will be
rganized. .
The State executive committee of the
ocialist Labor party met last night at the
'urk-street Temple. Leo Gasser was
hairman. The committee received en
ouraging reports from the various sec
ions throughout the State urging a vigor
us campaign "against the forces of
ompetition and monopoly," and request
ng the State executive to challenge the
Id party leaders to a discussion of their
lolitical hobbies on the stump during the
oming campaign. It was decided to do
o, and a committee consisting of G. B.
tenham and Theodore Lynch was elected
o formulate a challenge to the State ex
cutive committees of all existing parties,
hallenging them to debate the economic
[uestion or the dominant planks of their
espective platforms.
The secretary was instructed to notify

The publication in yesterday's Call of c
the story of the surprising changes at the V
Cogswell Polytechnic College and the Me- *â 
:hanics* Institute caused a general com- '
motion among the. officers and employes o
if these two establishments. . p
Early in the afternoon Dr. Cogswell C
strolled down to the library building on I(
Post street to talk over -the business with *
Secretary Culver. Professor Buchanan and f'
Prustee Ewing were also on hand. S(
ut. uogsweii, tne iounder of tbe college, Â£
hought it was very presumptuous in Pro- v
lessor Buchanan to criticize him or the P
policy of the trustees in the management n
>f the school. ";
The professor himself was as smiling
md serene as usual and said that he
liould soon leave the City for f.ns Anp-nlf>Â«
o accept an appointment in the Throoo
institute. "If Ido not find the surround-
iirs there congenial," said the professor,
'I shall return to San Francisco and enter
nto the service of the Public School De
partment. The university diploma which Â£
l hold exempts me from any preliminary
examination."
The college, with an enrollment of 300
itudents, will be reopened Monday, the
!7th of this month. The trustees are
liighly pleased at having secured the ser
rices of James H. Culver. He will be the H
manager of the college ' and exercise a
general supervision over both the business
md scholastic departments.
"For these duties," said Trustee Ewing,
'he is peculiarly well qualified. A pattern
maker by trade, an expert bookkeeper and
accountant, an experienced business man a'
)f rare executive ability, who is thor- g
oughly familiar with the'modern methods
af conducting a manual training institu
tion. What more could we desire? He will
nut personally teach a class in the f<
academic department, bnt will oversee the o
ssiop work, serve as the secretary of the
trustee*, look out for the receipts" and ex- â
penditnres, so that there will not be any T
waste of the finances, and see that the
teachers preserve a proper discipline and *'
do their duty to the school and the stu- g
dents. v
"There will be some changes in the I
course of study at tbe opening of the term.
Clay modeling will be dropped and black- d
smithing will he taken up. Later on we n
shall have a foundry in operation and a
other practical features will be added from p
time to time. Our aim will be to fit p
students to battle with the world. The o
foundation for this is an ability for them t
to make their bread ana butter. With i<
this idea we teach millinery and dress- c
making to the girls, carpentry and iron-
work to the boys aud typewriting, stenog- b
raphy, etc, to" both sexes. Nearly all of i:
tne old teachers have been re-engaged and d
the few new ones will be employed in
speiim ucpsriineniÃ. . . c
The presence of Secretary Culver will be t
generally missed from the library building t
on Post street and the Pavilion, where be c
has been a prominent figure for .so many 1
years. For his position there are already
numerous applicants, but Robert ' Cash' is
not, as was inadvertently ; stated, one of =
the number. -.
PEERLESS ATHLETIC CLUB.
A. First- Class Entertainment Given by
- the Mission Athletes.
â  The Peerless Athletic Club gave Its first
athletic exhibition last evening at its club
rooms, 2523 Howard street. -.
Long before the hour appointed for the
inaugural exhibition ;â¢ of the evening, the
gymnasium was packed with members Jof
the club and invited friends. ', In the cen- ;
ter of the building was erected an eighteen
foot ring, within which the wrestlers and
boxers contested. .: Edward Broad, the
president, made a few brief remarks, intro
ductory to the sports of the evening, dur-
ing which he said that the Peerless Clab
represeniea me oetter class oi people in I
the Mission who bave a predilection for
athletic sports.
He hoped that members would stanchlv
support athletics, and judging from the
rapid increase in membership he had no
hesitancy in stating that the Peerless Club
is destined to remain a permanent fixture,

8FORESTERS WILL
SEEK THE WOODS
A Picnic at Glen Ellen on
the Fourth of
July.
PLANS FOR THE AFFAIR.
An Event in Forestry Looked
Forward To by Many
Members.
COMPANIONS OF THE FOKEST.
The Ladies of the Order Will Lend
Ma'erial Aid to Make the
Day a Success.
Inspired by patriotism, the Foresters
have concluded that the Fourth of July
would be the proper day on which to hold
their annual picnic. The particular picnic
in this instance is not one in which all tne
members of the order of the State will
particiDate, but one in which the members
of the many courts in this City, in Ala
meda and Contra Costa counties and the
counties bordering on the bay will take
part in this outing they will have the
companionship of tbe circles of the ladies'
auxiliary known as the Companions of
the Forest.
Some time in March there was a meet
ing of the various courts and councils,
some sixty in number, each being repre
sented by properly accredited delegates.
The delepnto~ resolved to hold si picnic
and organized for that purpose, electing
the follow ing-named officers to carry out
the objects of the meeting: J. G. Florence,
president; Mrs. L. Ticoulet, first vice
president; Emmet Hayden, second vice
president; C. H. Bremer, treasurer; W. H. j
Logan, recording secretary; and J. J.
Cordy, financial secretary.
J. J. Cordy, E. Hayden, Mrs. Attwater |
and J.G. Florence were appointed a com- i
mittee on ground? and transportation, and
that committee, after visiting a number of
pleasure resorts, decided that Glen Ellen,
Sonoma County, was the most desirable
jlace for the purpose of the outing, and I
that is where it is going to be on the anni- |
versary of the independence of the United I
States."
The committee having general charge of
the affair has had several meetings, at '
which all arrangements for the event have
been discussed and adopted. There will
be a number of games, for which prizes
will be offered, and these will be awarded
to the successful competitors. There will
also be music for those who may wish to
dance.
The order of Foresters has_courts all
over the State of California, forty-two of
which are located in this City. Of the
many circles of tbe Companions twenty j
are located in San Francisco.
The order was originally instituted in
England in the middle of the eighteenth
century, under the name of the "Royal
Foresters." This organization continued
until 1534, when on account of the arbi
trary measures adopted by the supreme
officers a secession took place and a new
organization was formed under the name
of the "Ancient Order of Foresters,"
â¢ vhich order was introduced later on into
the United Stat6s. Up to 1889 about 500
courts had been established, with a mem- j
bership of about 50,000, when another se
cession took place, in which nearly all the
courts of the United States took part and
reorganized under the principles of Ameri
can fraternal societies under the name of
"Ancient Order of Foresters of America."
This secession was caused in part by
arbitrary measures adopted by the Su
preme authorities located in Great Britain.
Tbe immediate cause, however, was what
is known as the "Color Question." The
Foresters of America, having refused to
strike out the word "white" from their
constitution, the various courts were sus
pended and remained so until August 15,
1889, when, at a meeting held in Minne
apolis, Minn., the order was reorganized
under the name above stated and thereby
severed all connection with the old order.
At the session of the Supreme Court held
in Cleveland, Ohio, in September, 1895,
the name cf the. order was changed to
Foresters of America.
The purposes of the organization, among
others, are: The mutual protection and as
sistance of its members in sickness and
distress; the burial of members and mem
bers' wives, and the relief of relatives left
unprovided for by the decease of a mem
ber.
Tb,e primary object of a court (by which
titta lodges are named), is to guarantee its
members:
Firstâ An allowance to members m sick
ness not exceeding $7 50 a week.
Secondâ To furnieh medicine and the
services of physician without cost.
Third â To seek the comfort of members
when sick or in affliction.
Fourthâ To provide relief in time of ad
versity and distress.
Fifthâ To sut.i.ly specific sums for the
burial of member- and members' wives.
The Companions of the Forest, or ladies'
degree of the Foresters of America, was
originally organized in California, and is
now established in eighteen of the differ
ent States in our Union. In California
circles are located in Alameda, Chico,
Fresno, Golden Gate, Grass Valley, Los
Anpeles, Marysville. Mountain View,
Nevada City, Oakland, Ocean View, Oro
ville, Petaluma, Ban Kafaei, San Jose,
San Pedro, Santa Ana, Santa Barbara,
Sonora, Stockton, Watsonville, Woodland
and Yuba City. This branch of the order
is rapidly growing, and its membership is
composed of Foresters of America and
their lady relatives and friends.
legalized Bond, Issue.
A certified copy of the proceedings of the
board of directors of the San Francisco and

regular meeting held June 10, 189G, was yes

At the meeting specified the board author

DROPPED HIS GRIP
AND OPENED FIRE,
Exciting Scene at O'Far
rell and Taylor
Streets.
THERE WERE FOUR SHOTS
Gripman Isham Wounds His
Brother-in-Law, E. C.
Plume.
THE WOUND NOT DANGEROUS.
Isham Arrested and Bcoked on tbe
Charge of Assaa't to Commit
Murder.
The strained relations which have ex
isted for some time between W. Isham, a
gripman on the Hyde-street line, and Ed
ward C. Plume, a conductor on the Geary
street line, ended in a shooting affray yes
terday afternoon.
Ishaia and Plume married sisters. Isham
and his wife did not live happily together,
and about two weeks ago they were di
vorced. Since they separated, some
months ago, Mrs. Isham has been living
with her sister, Mrs. Plume, at 295 Parker
avenue.
Yesterday was Plume's day off and he
went downtown with a friend, Thomas J.
Blight Jr., who lives at 24 Ferric Street.
Plume made a few purchases and was car
rying a parcel in his hand when he and
Blight took their seats on the dummy of a
cable-car at O'Farrell and Stockton streets,
of which Ishara was the gripman.
After the car started Plume made a re
mark to Blight which Isham overheard
and resented. A hot exchange of words
followed till finally Plume called Isham a
liar. Isham retorted by calling Plume a
cnr. By this time the car had reached
Taylor street and Isnam stopped it and,
I rabbin;; Plume by the arm, tola him to
get off the car.
There was a brief struggle, and as Plume
was stepping off Isham pulled a revolver
out of his pocket and fired a shot at him?
The bullet grazed Blight's left cneek,
which was slightly powder-burned try the
discbarge, and lodged in the caff of
Plume's left leg.
Isham fired three more shots, but Plume
dodged behind an iron post in front of a
grocery and none took effect. Ed Cun
ningham, who is connected with the Over
land Monthly, appeared on ihe scene at
this time, and seeing Plume staggering
around took hold of him and kept him
from falling. Isham then boarded the
car again and proceeded on his trip.
Policeman W. Coleman was standing at
Taylor and Geary streets when he heard
the shots. He ran toward O'Farrell street
and was told about the shooting. He
chased after Isham's car and, overtaking
it at Jones street, placed Isham under ar
rest. T. c patrol wagon waa summoned
and Piume, Isham, Coleman, Cunning
ham and Blight were driven to tho Receiv
ing Hospital. Later Isham was taken to
the City Prison and charged with assaut t
to murder. His revolver was booked as
evidence against him, and a revolver
which Plume bad in his pocket was also
held by the police.
Dr. Thompson extracted the bullet
from Plume's leg. It had passed almost
clean through, and fortunately had not
touched the bone.
Isham blamed Plume for his domestic
troubles. "Plume has been looking for
trouble for a long time," said Isham, "and
he has got it now. Every day he was off
duty he would come on my car and nag at
me about my wife, but he went too far to
day. I did not shoot at him till I saw him
put his hand behind his back and begin
pulling out his revolver.
"Then 1 got mad and fired at him.
There was only one other passenger on
the car besides Plume and Blight, but I
don't know who he was. He could prove
that Plume attempted to pull his gun be
fore 1 fired."
Both Piume and Blight denied that the
former attempted to pull hia revolver.
"Why," said Plume, "1 had the parcel on
my knees holding it with both hands,
when Isbam grabbed hold of me to put
me off the car and then fired at me.
"He has no cause to blame me for his
domestic troubles. He had himself to
blame. She was a good wife to him, but
he treated her brutaliy until she was
forced to get a divorce Irom him. I took
his wife's part and that is why be has had
It in for me."
Plume, after his wound was dressed,
was driven home in a hack.

GLIMPSES OF ARCADIA.
Witness Anderson on the Stand
in the Ashley-Baldwin
Case.
His Ineffectual Struggle With Dates.
The Trial Must Closi To-
Day.
All day yesterday in Judge Slack's
court Andrew Anderson, witness for Lil
lian Ashley in her suit against E. J.
Baldwin, was on the stand.
Anderson was not a good witness, at
least for the defense, which was cross-ex
amining him regarding his knowledge of
events on the Santa Anita rancho when
Lily bloomed there.
Most all of the long hour 3of the day
were passed by the witness in trying to
grapple with dates. He had single-round
contests with the year, month and day of
almost every occurrence he mentioned in
his statement.
Occasionally the wearing monotony of
! the long questioning and answering
\ was broken when the witness got away
! from his unequal struggle with a date and
: told of some event. Then his hearers
| would get a peep into the Arcadia where
i Lucky and Lillian roamed amid the orange
\ groves. The bucolic beauties of Santa
I Anita would swing into view like a mirage
' above the desert wastes. The tree-crowned
; hills, tne green slopes, the adobe ranch
! house, the cottage where love was ten
! anted â according to Witness Anderson â
and the lakelet rippling over its silver
I sands.
But the defendant's counsel would call
: witness back to the eternal dates, and the
: picture would dissolve, leaving again the
, wastes. The other side would never let
| him stray around that cottage with its oc-
I cupant. Once he read from his memo
: rasida a note to the effect that he knew
; things ot the defendant's dolce-far-mente
life at Santa Anita, but his knowledge was
stricken out, and he was tolH to tax his
j recollection only with dates. lie had testi
fied that Baldwin had told him it would
be a good joke to bnrden Felvey, the ranch
! overseer, with the fatherhood of Miss
! Ashley's child, but he was unable, even
: with two journals to tell when the cunvcr-
I sation took place.
He also testified that he had had a law
suit with Bal iwin over his wages, and
while his claim amounted to $<X) ohe had
been obliged to take $300. He had for-
I merly been assisting Jibs Ashley in her
i suit and had a contract from her promig
| ing him 10 per cent of whatever she won.
However, he had surrendered the contract
and all claims upon her upon the payment
of $5.
And so the examination of the witness
went on with objections from opposing
counsel until the closing hour. The court
notified the attorneys in the case that the
trial must close to-day without fail. Mr.
Critteoden stated that the plaintiff de
sired to put on several more witnesses and
he could not possibly finish in that lime.
He was informed by Judge Slack that
there would be an evening session to-night
and the case must close then.
The trial will be resumed at 11 o'clock
this morning.

Order Made Yes

THE NINETY DAYS' LIMIT.
The Board Resolves Not to Tax
Nickel-in-the-Slot Tele*
phones.
The Supervisors have passed the resolu
tion providine for the submission to pub
lic competition of the application of the
Gear y-st reel, Park and Ocean Railroad
Company for a street railroad franchise.
Tiie resolrtion provides that bids shall
be received for the franchise in open ses
sion of the Board of Snpervisors Monday,
Aucust 3, 1896, from 2:30 to 3P. m., and
that no proposal for said franchise in any
sum less than $5000 will be entertained by
the board.
In the session of the board held last
Monday afternoon the resolution was
adopted, but Supervisor Dimond voting
in the aflirmative nave notice that he
would move for a reconsideration at the
next regular meeting.
It wan supposed that the resolution to
reconsider would so delay the advertising
ol tLf franchise that the privilege could
not be iesally advertised and sold ninety
dava before the general election. The law
I does not permit the grant of a franchise
Tiituin ninety days before a general elec
tion, and it is eu open question whether
! the right to soli a franchise within that
limit of time exists.
'Ihe Supervisors favoring the sale of the
privilege decided to take no chances, so
the board adjourned Monday afternoon to
meet Tuesday at 9 a. m.
When tne board met yesterday morn
ing, Supervisors King, Scully, Benjamin,
' Hirscb, Dimond, Hughes bunker, Tay
lor, Morgenatern, HobOsand Wagner were
present.
Supervisor Benjamin was called to the
chair. After the disposal ot some unfin-
I isi;ed business in committee of the whole,
I Mr. Wagner called up the motion to ro
; consider the vote by which the franchise
j resolution was adopted. The members
voting to reconsider were Hirscn, Di
mond, Taylor, Hobbs and Wagner â 5.
Those voting against reconsideration
were King, Scully, Benjamin, Hughes,
I Dunker and Morgenslernâ -6.
Tne adoption ot the order was therefore
i announced. The first official publication
] was made last evening.
The Supervisors in committee of the
i whole, Mr. Dimond in the chair, beard
\ John I. Sabin of the telephone company
I in regard to a provision in a pending ordi
i nance requiring license to be paid for
j maintaining nickel-in-the-slot telephones.
Mr. Sabin asserted that San Francisco
was suuplied with superior telephone
equtpment and that the service was
cheaper than in New York, Chicago,
I Boston or Bt. Louis. The system here
' was first class. Ho remarked that 2000
i subscribers depenued on the nickel-in- the
slot machine. The license of %i proposed
to be levied would set the service back one
year and deprive many people of facilities
which they can now afford.
Mr. Sabin held that it was not necessary
for a monopoly to be unpopular and cited
! the good feeling which existed between
j his company ana its customers. He con
; tended that no community would support
1 two telnphone companies.
Mr. Taylor moved to strike out the
charge to nickel-in-the-s!ot telephones and
i the motion prevailed. The ordinance thus
amended whs passed to print. The board
! heard J. Â£. Hull, an inventor, and M.
! Clayton, secretary of the Sutter-street
Railroad Company, on the merits and
demerit* of vrrious appliances known as
! car-fendtrs, but no action was taken. The
j subject was deferred on motion of Mr.
| King.

Louis Loup, Chief Deputy Internal
Revenue Collector, will soon have his
hands full, although that is not saying he
has not had his full complement of work
heretofore. As a matter of fact he has for
months been the executive official in his
department, as Collector Welburn, its
head, is obliged to devote most of his
time to outside business, and is seldom
seen in the Appraisers' building.
The particular business which Is to add
considerable to Mr. Lonp's duties will be
the outcome of instructions received from
Washington in regard to the distilling of
brandy from fruits. The coming of these
instructions was heralded last Friday in
an article published in The Call.
The instructions in full read :

Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary
of the Treasury, may exempt distillers of
brandies made exclusively from apples,
peaches, grapes, pineapples, oranges, apricots,
berries or prunes from any provisions of this
title relating to the manufacture of spirits,
except as to the tax thereon, when in his
judgment it may seem expedient to do so.
Approved June 3, 1890.
In addition to his other duties Chief
Deputy Loup is also United States Sur
veyor of Stills, the only one in this dis
trict, which extends for 700 miles from
Contra Costa County to beyond the Mexi
can line, south of San Diego.
Speaking on the subject Mr. Lonp said
yesterday:
"This new order will be of incalculable
benefit to Central and Southern California.
There are thousands of tons of apricots,
pears, oranges and prunes as well as
berries that have gone to waste for years
each season, simply that they could not
be dried and went to rot.
"It has always been considered illicit to
make brandy from these, and now the
embargo is raised. Heretofore the only
brandy distilled was from apples, peaches
and grapes.
"The duty of the fruit-growers desiring
to take advantage of the concession made
to them by the Government is to file new
notice and a new bond with this office,
and get a resurvey of their distilleries.
This latter work will keep me going for
many months beginning at the end of
July.
"You see, this resurveying is necessary
for the reason that each fruit has a differ
ent producing capacity, and the old sur
vey on the producing capacity of apples,
peaches and grapes must necessarily be
upset where prunes, apricots and pears
will be utilized in Central California and
oranges in southern counties."
One hundred thousand tons of apples
are raised on English soil yearly.

FIGURING ON THE
NEXT TAX LEVY.
Estimates of Cash Required
for the City's De
mands.
THE YEAR OF 1896-97.
Finance Committee Considers
Recommendations of the
Auditor.
SOME SLIGHT REDUCTIONS.
Several Big Items Pasred Over for
Further Discussion by the
Committee.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors held a session yesterday to
consider the estimates for maintaining the
various departments of the municipal gov
ernment for the fiscal year ending June 3o,
1897. The Supervisors attending were:
Messrs. Taylor. Benjamin and Hobbs.
In considering the amounts estimated by
the Auditor, as before published, the com-
mittee took into consideration the amounts
allowed for the fiscal year of 1895-96, now
closed.
Many important items were passed over
for future discussion, and among the items
so deferred were the salaries of the Health
Department, $23,640; reporters' expenses
in criminal courts, $40,000; deputies and
copyists of the County Clerk's office,
|126,OO0; extra deputies for the Assessor,
$65,000: janitors City Hall, $24,720, and
Gulden Gate Park, $250,000.
The work of the â¢ Finance Committee is
not by any mean? final, as the estimates
must go to the Board of Supervisors for
adoption. The pressure for an increase
generally comes after the. Finance Com
mittee revises the Auditor's recommenda
tions. The reductions and increases sug
gested by the Finance Committee yester
day were slight, and will not materially
change the aggregate published in The
Call when the Auditor's figures were sub
mitted.

mittee are:

a reduction of/ $51,000. A reduction of
$2000 : in extra deputies for the Tax Col
lector and $2500 for extra deputies for the
Auditor were recommended...
The allowance of $180,000 for election ex
penses - was deemea necessary. " City and
County Attorney ' Creswell expressed this
opinion to the committee and the fact
was -considered that the Auditor, who
made the estimate, is ! a member of the
Board of El-ction Commissioners. < It
was assumed that the Auditor and Regis
trar made the calculation. ;
- Not a word was said against the allow
ance of $200,000 for water for municipal
purposes. . There was a slight kick against
$300,000 for lighting the streets, but the
subject y was dismissed when it was :re
called that the amount, was fixed by law.
The chairman, Mr. Taylor, said gas and
electric lights were often placed together,
probably because the gas was so dim that
an electric light was needed to see it.
AN ESCHEATED ESTATE.
The State Has Fallen Heir to Over
Three Thousand Dollars.
Information has been tiled in the County
Clerk's office by W. P. Fitzgerald, State
Attorney-General, that the estate of Pat
rick Moran is escheat and claiming the
money in behalf of the State of California.
Patrick Moran died intestate in this
City in 1877. At the time of his death he
had on deposit in the Hibernia Bank
$2000, which has since by reason of com
pounding of interest increased to $3500.
Eight months ago B. P. Oliver was ap
pointed administrator of the estate, which
lias now been escheat for over twelve
years and is therefore legally the property
of the State.
A claimant, named Martin Moran. has
however appeared, and now application is
made for the issuance of a summons re
quiring all persons interested in the estate
to show cause why the money should not
be turned over to the State Treasurer.
GILL IS INDIGNANT.
Claims the Olympic Athletes Were Not
Fairly or Courteously Treated
in Portland.
Captain Leonard Gill of the Olympic
athletic team returned yesterday morning
from Portland. He spoke in terms of the
highest- praise of the performances of the
Multnoraah Club's athletes, especially of
Gallant, their mile runner, who, Gill says,
can run the mile in 4:31 1-5.
"While I cannot commend too highly,
with one or two exceptions, the deeds of
the athletes who competed against us,"
declared Gill, "the conduct of Gilsan, pres
ident of tue club and referee, and Gold
smith, chairman of the outdoor athletic
committee, was reprehensible to amateur
sports on this coast. Gilsan's refusal to
recognize my protest in the 220 hurdle I
shall carry up to the Pacific Amateur
Athletic Union. Look at this! We were
the visiting club. I protested against the
placing of the hurdles. The inside and
outside hurdles were put at the same dis
tance. Peterson, onr runner, was given
the outside. This required that he should
run eight yards in excess of Morgan to tie
him. I protested, Gilsan disallowed the
protest, and Patterson wouldn't run. We
lost three points.
"We were defeated by crowding a few
men into the events, by an incompetent
referee and the chairman of the athletic

LEES WANTS HIS REWARD
He Claims the State Owes Him
$1000 for Capturing Ivan
Kovalev.
Judge Troutt Issues a Writ of Man
date, but the Case Gees to the
Supreme Court
Captain I. W. Lees has applied for a writ
ot mandate compelling State Controller E.
P. Colgan to pay him the $1000 reward of
fered by Governor Markham for the arrest
and conviction of the murderer or mur
derers of the Weber family in Sacramento
in December, 1894. Tbe detective says
that his claim has been duly audited, al
lowed and approved by the State Board of
Examiners, but that payment is refused
by Controller Colgan.
The Controller refused to draw the war
rant because there is a doubt in law as to
whether a police officer of any department
of this State is locally entitled to such a
reward for the arrest of any person on a
charge of crime committed in this State.
He therefore desires to have the matter
settled by the courts before drawing the
warrant.
The case came up in Judge Troutt's
court yesterday, and, as it was agreed that
no matter which side won it would be
taken to the Supreme Court, the attorneys
agreed to make no fieht in the Superior
Court.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald had en
tered a demurrer asking that the petition
be not granted because insufficient grounds
for a cause of action had been given. Judge
Troutt overruled this demurrer. In order
to hasten matters the defense then refused
to put in an answer to the petition, and
his Honor then issued the writ as prayed
for by Captain Lees because of the default
of the defendant.
The matter will soon be heard by the
higher tribunal.

BARNEY FARLEY'S GREAT FEATS
The New Occidental Club Endea 1
ing to Match Frank Slavin and
Joe McAuliffe.
Through the courtesy of "Young"
Mitchell a Call reporter and an artist
were permitted yesterday to beard two of
the shining lights of pugilism in their
dens, to view the process by which they
acquire the muscle, agility and science to
battle for purse and reputation in the ring.
It was early in the afternoon when the
party started for Barney Farley's training
quarters, where "Mysterious" Billy Smith
is in training for his contest with Billy
Gallagher. Mitchell acted as the Jehu of
the trip and Billy Daly sat directly behind
him, where be remarked he could keep
good watch to see that no electric-cars
were derailed.
When Farley's was reached a motley
throng was in waiting. There were large
men, small meu, sports attired in sweaters
of rainbow hue, bicyclists who had strug
gled over tbe sandy hills to get a glimpse
of the champion welter-weight at home,
pugilists full of admirationat the Great
fi rm in which they found their brother in
tbe profession, and last but not least old
Barney Farley himself.
After all hands bad partaken of the
hospitality of the house they segregated
into croups and tell to discussing tbe
merits of the fistic carnival slated for
Thursday night, and tbe late little set-to be
tween "Sailor" Sharkey and Jim Corbett.
It is worthy of remark that in the wh ole
assemblage there was not one man but
that was imbued with the idea that the
lines of the champion's life had led into
thorny places, and that he had imitated I
the foolish virgins in neglecting to keep
his lamp filled and polished.
They are all against Corbett, these men
of the sporting fraternity. Even a tyro
could see this. It showed in the tone of
contempt with which his name was
mentioned. It manifested itself En the
mocking laughter with which each joke at
his expense was greeted. And then, when
some person, it anything more heavily
charged with indignation than the reÂ«t.
would lift up bis voice and make audible
demonstrations of the same, how the
frightened air would quiver with exple
tives and anathema.
"I don't want to throw water on a
drowned rat," said old Barney Farley,
"but there are a few things concerning
Corbett that I believe it mv duty to draw
attention to. Here lately" he has made
some statements against McAuliffe and
Choynski that are as false as they are un
called, for. His language, too, was such as
no gentleman would care to use.
"McAuliffe nas been whipped, I am
willing to admit, but it was by men who
are generally regarded as experts in their
line. He has never yet shirked a fight.
That is something James J. Corbett, ex
champion of the world, cannot say. You
may give it as my belief that Corbett de
liberately sought to avoid Filzsimmons at
Hot Springs, Arkansas, and sent that let
ter signed "Citizen," protesting against
the right as a disgrace to a civilized coun
try, that got him under arrest.
"Take John L. Sullivan, that poor old
physical wreck whom he bested. Did you
ever hear ot his getting arrested before a
fight? Nit! John always fought and was
arrested afterward.
"After the Sharkey-Williams contest I
proclaimed that Joe McAuliffe could thrash
Corbett in ten rounds. You doubtless re
member that tbe latter didn't jump at the
offer, as it was expected he would. My
friends came to me and said I was making
rash prophecies and was away oft in my
little talk, but here lately they have come
to me and said they guessed I knew what I
was doing. Yes, sir; I haven't been in
this business forty-six years for nothing.
"The championship lias been in the last
stages of consumption ever since Corbett
defeated Sullivan. That fellow ought to
be egged off the stage every time he ap
pears."
Witd these words the disgruntled old
warhorse led the way to Smith 's training
quarters, followed by a few of tho elect.
Arrived there, the pugilist stripped for the
bag- punch ing exhibition his admirers ex
pected. When he appeared, attired in
black tights with red trunks, his skin
from the waist up shining like ivory and
the effect of judicious training manifest
ing itself in his bright eye and ruddy
cheeks, a spontaneous burst of applause
welled forth.
"Ah," said Barney, rubbmgl his Hands
together briskly, while his face was all
smiles, "that boy is the pride ot ray heart.
Did yon ever see any one in better condi
tion than that? Look at his eye â no over
training there. McGrath has put him in
tiptop shape."
Certainly Smith possesses a wonderful
physique. His shoulders are just Droad
enough to sugirest immense striking abil
ity, without that undue width so fatal to
grace and symmetry. His waist is per
fectly proportioned to his chest, and his
legs taper very evenly to his feet, which
are almost as small as a woman's.
Stepping to the bag, which was sus
pended from a small platform, Smith hit
it a brisk tap to set it going and then tbe
fun began. Quick as a flash he caught it
on the rebound and sent it against the
platform like a cannon ball. The siignt
frame building trembled withj the con
cussion. Fast and furiously blows were
rained upon the leathern sphere. Any
one of them was enough to put a pretty
good man into dreamland. He caught the
bag now from this side, now from that,
varying the exercise by hammering it with
one hand and driving it back with the
elbow. Then he would dexterously duck
the fast-swinging pendulum and hit it on
the opposite side. During the whole per
formance, though the bag was executing
every kind of geometrical figure in the
air round about Smith's head, in no in
stance did it hit him.
After some hopping and skipping
around to gain in suppleness and wind
Smith was given a good rubdown, and
donned the clothes of the layman. At
present he weighs 143 nounds. This is one
pound less tban be will bring into tbe
ring. He is undoubtedly a most supple
limbed and graceful boxer, and the unani
mous verdict of the experts is that he is a
safe man to wager on.
Once back at Barney Farley's resort,
and while a deal of discussion anent
Smith's skill and physical condition was
on, some one bantered the veteran sports
man on the fact that his hair is getting
very gray.
"Well," said that celebrity laughingly,
"maybe it is, but I can do things now that
you younger fellows can't do. I am 56
years old, but the old man is all there
yet," and after some coaxing Barney
agreed to show them what be could do.
Divesting himself of bis hat, coat, waist*
coat und snoes, he tied a string into so
small a circle that just the tips of his fore
finger could be inserted. Then he placed
each forefinger in tbe noose and jumped
back and forth over Ins hands. This act
bronght forth generous applause and
"Young" Mitchell offered a present of a
brand-new hat, to anybody that would du
plicate it. Several tried, but none won
the hat.
Farley then went into a room near by
and brought forth a handsome blackthorn
cane. It was bequeathed to him by Jack
Dempsey, and nothing could induce the
old sportsman to part with it. Placing
the end of the cane on a ten-cent piece,
Farley caught bold of each end and then
drawing his head between bis arms he
turned completely round without moving
his hands from the cane or the cane from
the piece of money on the floor. The offer
of a new hat was also made to duplicate
this, but no one succeeded.
"Now," said Barney, â¢'! am going to do
something that I haven't done for ten
years. Newspaper men have tried to get
me to do it for years to afford them a
write-up, but I have refused because my
wife is opposed to it. I'll do it now to
show yon ybnng bloods that the old man
hasn't lost his grip."
Taking a razor, he opened it and, hold
ing a tip of tbe blade in each band, fre
jumped back and forth over it as he had
with the string.
"For heaven's sake, Barney, quit that,"
said Daly, his face pale as a sheet.
Barney quit with a laugh, carelessly re
marking that he wasn't what he used to
be, but was still '.n the ring.
The irrepressible Mitchell here came in
with his little offer of a new hat to any one
that would duplicate tbe trick, but amid
an anxious silence nobody essayed the
feat.
A visit was next made to Gallagher's
training quarters at Blankin's Six-mile
House. There Gallagher, who is also in
the pink of condition, did some more bag
punching. He has a large coterie of fol-
Jowers, who are perfectly willing to post
their money on him.
Here, also, Jeffries ia in training, and is
is confident of victory over his brawny op
ponent, Dan Long.
The next place visited was Long's train
ing-quarters at Ocean Beach. Long ap
pears to be in fine condition and will put
up a sharp light. One remarkable thing in
connection with Long is his reach. He
can stand perfectly erect and touch the
tops of his kneepans with his middle
fingers.
"Now," said Mitchell, on rhe homeward
trip, "you have seen a man in training for
a contest in each of three different places,
and you see it is no fun." Nobody disputed
this. Why should he? Mitchell is the
winner of every contest in which he en
gaped and oueht to know.
The new Occidental Club is now nego
tiating with Slayin's manager for a fight
with Joe McAuliffe. McAuliffe is said to
be willing to make a match.
AT CRIPPLE CREEK.
Rapid and Substantial Growth Has
Followed the Fire.
D. William Douthitt, son of the late
Judge D. William Douthitt, has just re
turned from Colorado, ana while there
made a tnorough investigation of tbe
Cripple Creek district.
The town of Cripple Creek, he says, now
presents an appearance of great activity.
The frame shacks which were destroyed
by the fires are now being renlaced by
substantial bricK buildings, and the busi
ness of the district has received a new
impetus. Mines are being developed
rapidly and money is plentiful. Gillette
is the best laid out town and enjoys the
best climate. A company has been'orean
ized which proposes to build an electric
line to connect Victor. Cripple Creek and
Gillette and outlying districts. Of course
the towns in the vicinity of Cripple Creek,
especially Colorado Spri igs, are prosper
ing wonderfully in a business light.
Gillette is now the central point of in
terest in the Cripple Creek District. New
discoveries are being reported every day.
Some exceptionally fine properties have
been recently opened, and the town has,
since the fire, been receiving considerable
attention.
WILL PUSH THE CARNIVAL
The Executive Committee De
vises a New Plan of
Campaign.
Preliminary Steps Taken to the Call.
ing of a Monster Mass*
Meeting Soon-
The executive committee of the Carnival
of the Golden Gate met last night in a
parlor at the California Hotel, took hold
of the carnival proposition with renewed
vigor, and a committee was rppointed to
get out among the "big wigs" of the City
and nush the thing along.
In addition to General Warfield, presi
dent of the committee, the other members
present were: General Backus, secretary;
Dr. Devlin, Colonel John O'Byrne, J. L.
Rosenthal, R. P. Doolan, K. B. Soule and
F. A. Haber.
A letter from William H. Mills wÂ»s read
stating that owing to absence and illness
he could not meet with the committee
last night, but that after the Fourth of
July he expected to call a meeting of the
committee on decoration and otherwise
co-operate in carnival work. Mr. Mills'
letter stated that his committee expected
to secure the assistance of the Park Com
missioners in decorating the park.
Mr. Rosenthal said he bad been out
among business men and found that
there was considerable interest in the car
nival.
Upon motion President Warfield ap
pointed Messrs. Rosenthal, Haber and
Colonel George Stone a committee to call
upon the presidents and prominent mem
bers of the Chamber of Commerce, Board
of Trade, Merchants' Association and
Manufacturers' Association, talk carnival
and try to interest them in the project.
Those interested will then hold a council
of war on a plan of campaign to awaken
the interest of San Franciscans in the car
nival project, with the idea of calling a
mass-meeting or something of that sort to
whoop it up.
It was also decided that invitations
should be sent out to from 150 to 200 prom
inent business and professional men to
participate.
Buttons of the carnival colorsâ blue,
gold and cardinalâ will be sent to all the
editors of California.
The Geographical Bociety of California
will meet next Friday evening in their
rooms to decide what action they will take
on the carnival.
There will be an elaborate system of re
ception and entertainment of visitors from
subdivisions to entertain the dignitaries of
the State down to that class of people
from the hills who blow out the g&Â«. The
Press Club has promised to look aftÂ«r the
editors who come and keep them out of
the hands of bunko steerera.

DUPONT STREET BONDS,
High â¢ Priced Tenders to Ex
change Securities for
Coin.
Entire Offering Little More Than the
Available Moneyâ The Suc
cessful Bidders.
Treasurer Widber yesterday noon opened
bids for the surrender of Dnpont-ntreet
bonds. He had a sum on hand slightly
in excessÂ»of $375,000 for the redemption of
bonds, and under the provisions of the act
of tbe Legislature of 1876 invited the hold
ers to name a figure at which they would
exchange the securities for coin. Each
bond is of the denomination of $1000 and
the lowest figure offend yesterday was
$945. The prices ranged from this figure
to par. Under the advertisement the
Treasurer could not entertain a bid above
par. The number of bonds tendered was
410, and the money on hand was sufficient
to pay lor 384 and also to provide for the
payment of $34, the coupon of each bond
for tbe last six months' interest.
The following tabulated statement gives
the name of each bidder, the price bid and
the total amount received for surrender of
the bonds:

tended the session. It was a common re
mark that the figures were high, and it
will be observed that the leading bankers
put the highest values on the securities.
The highest figure made in any accepted
tender was $999 40. The First National
Bank tendered seven at this rate, but the
money remaining was not sufficient to
take the whole, so only five were taken at

SOME SHARP CRITICISM.
The American Women's Liberal League
on the Fourth of July
â¢ Committee.
Some representatives of the American
Women's Liberal League were refused ad
mittance to the deliberations of the Fourth
of July Committee last Monday, and in
consequence the league has adopted the
following resolutions:
Resolved, That this American Women's Lib
eral Lengue condemns the action of the Fourth
of July Committee in refusing to admit the
representatives of this league to its delibera
tions, thereby depriving them of their rights
as citizens and taxpayers to know how public
funds are distributed and contracts awarded;
and be it lurther
Eesolved, That we condemn the Fourth of
July Committee for transacting public busi
ness after the manner of a secret society.
The league further charges that the posi
tion of chaplain was refused the grandson
of a Revolutionary soldier because he was
a Catholic priest, and a denunciation of
this course as being one of narrow-mind
edness and bigotry is included in the reso
lution.

AS THEY CAN BE,
Looking Longingly for the
New Panacea From
Japan.
A TON OF IT FOR THEM.
The Course of Treatment Will
Begin To-Day at the
Festhouse.
EXILES EAGEK FOR RELIEF.
Frank Bindt, Who Has Been Ten Years
a Leper, Has Tried the
Meiicine.
The $40 25 of duty on the ton of Dr.
Goto's Japanese anti-leprosy specific was
paid yesterday by Supervisor Benjamin.
To-day the medicine will be carted out
to the Pesthouse, where the fourteen
lepers are awaiting its arrival with anxious
Patients Awaiting the Coming of tbe New Kcmedy in the Corridor of the
Pesthcusc
eyes and pitiful expectancy. They look
for it with that emotion with which a
drowning man going down the last time
in the current suddenly finds the earth
under his feet and his head above water.
They look upon it as a current of discovery
flowing from the mysterious land of
scientific research which may carry them
out again into the world which they can
6ee over the high board fence and through
the waving tre^s of their environment,
but from which they are as mucn exiles as
though confined on an island in the 6ea.
The fourteen lepers in the Pesthouse are
in various stages of the disease. There is
â¢he new comer, whose eyes are stiil bright
with hope and whose step is light; while
kept from sijrht, even as much as ] ossible
irom his fellow -sufferers, is the miserable
creature held together by bandages,
almost too weak- to move, and waiting
I atiently for death. Who knows that the
medicine may not be a panacea for him?
Science b doing more every day for
humanity. It now seems to have extended
the welcome hand of relief to a disease
whose birth dates from 1500 B. C. and
whose cradle was the valley of the Nile.
In those days lepers were permitted their
ireedom, but they went aoout clothed in
long pray robes, with hoods concealing
their faces, and wooden clappers in their
hand to warn all of their approach. It is
still generally supposed that contact with
lepers breeds the disease, but the latest
researches of science indicate that leprosy
is a constitutional disease and is not con
tagious.
But while they conversed to a Call
reporter at the Festhouse yesterday after
noon the score and more of lepers, foliow-
A GROUP OF LEPERS AT TUE DOOR OF THE PESI HOUSE.
â ng the custom that is almost as old as the
syratulds of Egypt, stood around with
(heir hands in their pockets. They shrink
!rom contact with visitors, knowing well
;bac tne world fears to touch them.
But there were several to whom it would
save been physically impossible to put
:heir hands in ttie pockets of modern
;rousers unless they were specially en
larged. Tbeir hands were swollen from
ili semblance to their natural shape and
ilze.
Superintendent J. P. Keating was down
â¢own seeing about the transportation of
â¢he medicine from the Custom-house to
he Pesthouse and P. D. McMillan, the
issistant superintendent, called out Frank
Bindt, who has been a leper in the institu
ion for ten years.
Bindt is an intelligent young man on
Thorn the disease peeius to have touched
ightly. His appearance, to all except the
experienced eye of a physician, does not
how leprosy. Bindt it was who first
ailed the attention of Supervisor Benja
nin and The Call to the Japanese cure
for the disease, with the result that almost
a ton of it is now practically on the way to
the relief of himself and associates.
The fourteen patients comprise a Mcxi-
I can, Pedro Pindora by name; two Russian
I Finns, one of whornis quite cheerful and
;is familiarly called "Big" Bruce; two
i Americans, and the remaining nine are
Chinese. There are no Japanese lepers
there. Frank Bindt ha* a brother, Ernest,
in the institution. He has tried the Goto
remedy before ai.d srjeaks highly of it.
Be said :
"At the island of refuge for lepers in the
Hawaiian croup the medicine has been
tried, and according to report it has suc
ceeded in making a number of cures.
â  Several lepers who claim to be cured have
appealed to the Government to release
them, but the Government has not
| done so. Ido not know whether they arc
j cured or not, but if they are no longer
lepers they should be allowed to go."
"From your experience with the medi
cine do you think a cure is possible? 1 ' was
asked.
"In cases where persons have been found
to have the disease in its early stages I
think it altogether probable. The medi
cine did me goo'iâ a good doal of good. 1
can't say jusi why I irave it up, but it it is
taken regularly and faithfully I think
those who are not in the last stages of
leprosy may be cured.
"The trouble is," he continued, "in get
tine those who have the disease to keep up
the treatment. Tnis may be owing to the
natural lassitude of lepers. For instance,
it is difficult to get a Chinaman to take
medicine. lie may try it for a week or
two. but if hÂ« does not see or feel any im
mediate improvement he will stop it."
Describing the treatment Frank Bindt
continued: "The medicine comes in three
forms'. There are little pills, a powder
which must be drunk in water and there
are medicated baths, to take two or three
times a day. So you see that, while we
â¢ have plenty of time and not much to do,
] it requires some effort and determination
i to keep at the treatment."
"Are you going to take the treatment?''
"Certainly !"
t "And your brother and the others?"
THE NURSE AT THE PESTUOUSE.
"I suppose so," he replied.
The first dose of the medicine will be
given this afternoon. Superintendent
Keating, and probably City Physician
O'Brien and Supervisor Benjamin will be
present when the treatment is begun.
The action of the great Japanese specific
will be watched with great interest by not
only the physicians of San Francisco, but
of all other cities in the country. ThiÂ« is
the first use of the medicine on the Pacific
Coast, and, according to report here, also
in the United States.
The Bindt boys* and several of the others
have friends on the outside who visit them
occasionally and give them money. Their
clothing and food is Drovided by the
County and City, and beyond that their
needa are small. The Bindts buy books
and newspapers and keep themselves
pretty well informed on what is going on
in that world whicn they see but cannot
mingle with. Others smoke and chew
tobacco, out it is a singular fact that not
one leper among tne fourteen is fonu of
intoxicating liquor. Their money is
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1896.
Governor James 11. Budd and Party at Hazel Green, Near Yosemite. The Vehicle Represented Is the
First of a Line of Stages Recently Put on the CoulterviHe Road From Merced to Yosemite.
It is Due to the Inauguration of This Line, According to N. H. Wilson, Its Manager, That
Fares to Yosemite Have Been Reduced. Mr. Wilson Denies That the Governor's Trip Had
Anything to Do With the Reduction.
passed from their hands into the hands of
tradespeople.
Assistant Superintendent McMillan says
he thinks there is no danger from this.
He has mingled with the lepers for a long
time, but he loes not fear taking the
disease. He Las had the Pesthouse im
proved and cleaned in various ways. Tne
roof of the lepers' ward still lsaks a little
over the hall.
Frank Bindt said they were well fea and
quite comfortable. He had another
brother in the Pesthouse up to about six
years ago, but one night he climbed over
the tall fence and ran away. He has uot
been seen since. It is reported at the
Pesthouse that he is in the country some
where working under an assumed name
as a farmhan 1. His was a light case. All
three of the brothers were apprehended
and sent to the Pesthouse soon after ar
rival here from Honolulu.
When asktl if there was not still dan
ger in the lepers escaping over the fence,
Assistant Superintendent McMillan said :
"No. You couldn't drive them awar from
here with a Gatling gun. lhey are too
well fed and cared for."
One of iht lepers is a Chinese woman.
She said: 'Me want medicine." Her
name is ".Annie." This poor creature is
a sight. Si c has a little room all to her
self in the main building awny from the
men. Formerly "Annie" did the washing
foi the leper men. Lately she has been
growing t< o feeble to work. She was paid
$2 50 for each washing by the City and
County. Annie saved her money and
bought one of those little organette* such
as blind men are heard grinding on the
streets. There is a slip of paper for each
tune, and "Annie" has a large number of
tunes, which she keeps in a box at her
side. The organette sits on a bmail table
before her.
The music which she grinds out is her
only amusement and consolation. She
Dlays often during the day. She played
for visitors yesterday and seemed pleased
at the opportunity. Sometimes visitors
!e:ivo her a few cents.
Often in the middle of the night that
doleful little wooden box may be heard
playing, while the wind whistles an ac
companying requiem in tbe big trees over
the roof. Her favorite tunes are: "Little
Ola Los Cabin in the Lane" and "The
lighthonse hy the Sea." Annie has some
newer music which the contributions of
visitors have enabled her to buy since ene
became too feeble to work. When she
feels more cheerful she can play "Fifteen
Dollars in My Inside Pocket" and "My
Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon. '
Annie's latest wish is for "Ma Angeline."
A lady visitor, one of that kind of women
who cannot look upon misery without
feeling a touch of sympathy and com
passion, sang "Ma Angeline" for her not
long ago, and now, il there is anything
that poor "Annie" wants next to the "big
medicine" that has come from far-away
Japan, it is that little gem of melody.

WHO SMOTE THE
YOSEMITE FARES ?
N. H. Wilson Says He Did
It With His New
Stage Line.
MAY BE ONLY A BLUFF.
J. H. Hutcbiogs Says the OW
Companies Have Not
Reduced.
WHAT GOVEKNOR BUDD DID.
His Excellency's Visit Declared to
Have Affected Only Hotel
Rates.
N. H. Wilson denies that Governor
Budd is the Mo.Â»es that struck the stony
hearts of the Yosemite stage companies
and brought forth a stream of grateful
reductions. Mr. Wilson is willing and
eager to admit that his Excellency did a
little successful smiting in the valley
itself, but that stage fares came down be
declares to be coincident wit . and not re
sultant of the Governor's rieit. Accord
ing to Mr. Wilson, and his statement is
corroborated by J. H. Hutchings, the
father of Yosjemite, it was Mr. Wilson
and his new stage line which brought the
established transportation company to a
realization of the desire of the poor man
to see nature's wonderland. This realiza
tion, Mr. Wileon declares, has resulted
not in lower rates being conceded by the
Raymond company, but in their skillfully
juggling with lieures and facts to make
reductions apparent where none exist.
"When it was announced that Governor
Budd was going to Yosemite," said Mr.
Wilson, "I visited him at Sacramento and
induced him to go by our road, that is
from Merced via Coulterville, Bowers Cave
and Hazel Green.
"On the :>7th of May he started and that
was the initial trip of crur stage company.
Governor Budd made the entire trip, as
he testified in an interview upon his re
turn to Sacramento, for $27 50, and that
is our regular charge from Sacramento.
His trip had nothing whatever to do with
our rates. We charge $25 for the round
trip from Merced and ttie fare from here
to Merced is $8 50. It makes no difference
whether we buy the tickets or the passen
gers procure their own, it is all the same,
as the Southern Pacific refuses to give us
a cent reduction. It is in no wise due to
any expose that the other company is an
nouncing reductions. They are simply
afraid of my road. I am known in that
country as a rustler and a fighter and they
are becoming alarmed."
J. H. Hutchings, who knows more
about Yosemite than the old Indians who
were born there, and who has spent the
f renter portion of his life in making
nown the beauties of the valley, was
indignant at the statements of the Wash
burn Stage Company iv regard to their
rates.
Referring to a statement of reduced
rates in a morning paper he said : "It is
untruthful, deceptive and misleading.
The entire Btatement i* merely to cover
| up their movements and keep the same
'. condition of affairs that has been in vogue
: all the time. For instance, they state the
! fare v a Raymond and Beresida is $40.
whereas they still continue to charge $50
| for the round trip. A Bpecial rate has
| been made of $33 50, but this applies only
to teachers, pupils and ministers. It is
true they have a round-trip rate of $25 by
way of Big Oak Flat, but they take care
that very few travel this route. Their
every effort is to discourage travel over
this road, and the sta^e U so timed that
it reaches stopping-plates about midnignt.
> Inquirers are told that the road is dunger
ous and are so strongly advised against it
that very few care to risk their lives for
the $25 saved.
"The stage line over the Big Oak Flat
road is not owned by the Raymond and
Berenda people, but the latter practically
control and suppress it. In consideration
I of the Big Oak Flat road not entering into
| active competition with the Raymond and
Berenda road A. H. Washburne, pro
i prie.or of the latter road, pays the pro
| prietor of the former road a bonu.s of from
' $5 to $7 for every passenger carried by way
[of Raymond. The same arrangement was
entered into with Mort McClenathan when
! he ran a stage over the Coulterville route.
j McClenatban received |9 for every pas
â  ssenger whicn the Raymond people carried.
i They so successfully prevented him from
getting any passengers of his own, how
ever, that he was glad to sell out to the
: Kavmond road. He was then given a
! position as driver for them.
"That was ten years ago. Since that
time there has been no stage run over tne
Coulterville road and the Raymond road
has practically monopolized the traffic.
The stage 1 ne which Mr. Wilson now
represents has made a bona fide reduction
to $33 50. I Lave no intereet in the road
financiully, but because of my interest in
the valley I would like to have the people
know the facts in regard to the matter.
"Ah an alleged insianceof magnanimous
reduction it is announced that hereafter
coupons will be issued with tickets sold in
San Francisco, allowing three uays horse
back riding in the valley for from $8 to $10.
The commissioners allow the stablemen
to charge only $3 a day under any circum
stances, so it is difficult to see where there
is any concession in allowing three days'
riding for from $3 to $10, which would
probably be $9.
"Governor Budd has succeeded in get
ting the hotels to make some reductions.
Formerly board and lodging were $4 a day
uniformly. Now it ranges from $2 to $4,
according to the location of tbe room.
Rooms may now be secured without board
and meals may be ordered a la carte. I
was in the valley last week and I saw
no other results of the visit of the Gov
ernor and the commissioners. Tde valley
is still a stock rancho, horses were running
at large and cows were playing havoc with
the outfits of campers."
Mr. Wilson says he expects to carry the
bulk of travel in 1897.
FRANK M'SLYNN' S BANQUET.
A * are well Occasion When He and
Other* Accepted Gold Watches.
A reception and banquet was given at

F. Smith responded to the toast, "The
State of the Order," and Rev. P. Mulligan
to "The State oi the Church." John J.
McDade replied to she toast, "Our Order."
Music enlivened an excellent menu.

All Quiet in Chinatown.
The prompt action of the police in regard to
the trouble brewing in the See Yup Company,
between the eleven families of that company
and the powerful Wong family under the
leadership of Ahee Tong, has effectually
quelled any outbreak on the part of the ex
cited Mongolians. An extra squad has been
on duty constantly since Monday under J.
Harper, sergeant ot tne Chinatown squad.
No more posters have been put up or torn
down. At a late hour last evening an oc
casional kettle-drum was all that disturbed
the quietness.

VARIGOGELE.
The Most Weakening of All the Bad
Effects Following: Excesses and
Indiscretions.
pEN CANNOT DESCRIBE THE TOR-
â *- ture inflicted upon the victim of Vari-
cocele. This disrase is a swollen condition
of the veins,' which' become weaK und
flabby, get blue, ropy, causing impure cir-
culation, unhealthy perspiration and ex-
treme weakness. It drains and drags. the
vital energy from the body. It destroys
strength; it ruins the nervous system, and
makes men unfit for society, business or
pleasure.
Do you suffer from it? Watch yourself
carefully. It "creeps upon its victim
quietly, like the serpent, and if you do not
strangle it upon the appearance of the first
symptoms it may sap the foundation from
your structure.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT
cures Varicocele. It give 3 Jife into the
veins and nerves, removes the stagnant
blood and Beta up a healthy circulation.
It cures in three months.
"The swollen "veins are gone and. mv
strength has all returned," says N. Da-

This disease destroys your nervous sys-
tem. Drive it from your body by Dr. San-

the same time in 1895.
Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
â¢t station indicate maximum temperature for the I
fays; those underneath It. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*, '
anring the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid I
lines, connect . points of equal air pressure; iso- i
therm v or. dotted lines, equal temperature. The [
word "hiith". means high barometric pressure and
usually accompanied by fair weaihe?: "low"
refers 10 low .' pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain*.
"Lows ' .usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interioi
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alonir the coast; rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb- !
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
â  will produce an opposite result. .

NEW YORK. N. V.. June SO.â ln Wall street
to-day there was a complete reversal of specu
lative sentiment. According to cable advices the
utterances of Mr. McKinley on the curency ques
tion led to a much more confident feeling in Lon
don and on the Continent, and the change was
reflected in buying orders for nearly 40.000 shares
from abroad. The result was a decidedly higher
opening, the gains varying from Vi to 1 per cent
at the sart. The local bean attempted to check
the rising tendency by putting out fresh lines of
shorts, but as the foreign demand continued and
there was a considerable inquiry for the long ac
count here the upward movement made a further
progress as the day advanced.
The silver question was relegated to the rear for
the time being ana the probable action of the Chi
cago Convention on the money plank excited less
Interest than of late. The fact that there were no
further engagements of gold for export and that
the local money market was undisturbed, as well
as the announcement by the Reading Company of
an advance in the price of coal, all exert, d a
favorable influence. The- rise in quotations was
equal to 2s/a p â¢â " cent and the net changes showed
gains of ]^@1% per cent. The conspicuous
features wife the grangers,' sugar, LoulsvMe
and Nashville and gome of the specialties.
Tobacco and sucrar were heavy at one time, the
former declining tram 63% to 61 V2. and the latter
from 111 to 109%, but subsequently, under pur
chase* ' supposed to be lor Inside account, tobacco {
got back to 63 Â»nd suirar to 1121/g Speculation
left off firm in tone. Total, sales were 251,100
shares. -."* â¢

CHICAGO "MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lix, June 30.â Wheat displayed un
expected vigor this morning ana "shorts" were
worked into a degree of nervousness such as they
have not experienced very recently. The declin
ing markets, which cave been the general rule of
late, caused the development of quite a fair-sized
short interest, and, naturally, any bulge would he
expected to create a demand for covering pur
poses. The approaching holiday afforded an op- |
portunity for evening up trades, but. in addition
to that, there were bullish reports by Tboman mid
by the Illinois Agricultural Bureau to stimulate /
buying.
The New York stock market was firmer, that
fact conveying a little more confidence to the
minds- of trader-). â¢ Liverpool â  cables were quiet
and i,4d lower. Receipts in the Northwest were
tree at 710 cars against 820 last Tuesday and 406
a year ago. Chicago bad 17 cars and inspected
out 45,300 bushels. Brad.street's reported a de
crease in 'the world's visible supply of 3,823,000
bushels. Closing Continental cables were irrccu
lar. â  Export 1 clearances were large at 601,913
bushels. September wheat opened from !>&i4@
5.16-gc, advanced to 67c, closing at 56% c, iy>c
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts lor
to-morrow. 14 cars.
COKNâ Obeyed the influence or a stronger eat
market, although at the immediate start there
seemed to be some hesitation, first quotation being
sliphtly below the final ones of yesterday, Re-
I ceipts were good at 650 cars and 454.599 bushels
were taken from sior<>. Liverpool cables were
quiet and i.4d lower. Thoman's report on the con
ditions oi the corn crop were less favorable than a
month ago. > Bradstreet's reported a decrease in
stocks of 284,000 bushels. Sep' ember corn opened
at 27Â»/g@^7%c, sold between 273/ 8 and 27%@28c,
closing at 2 7 % c bill, Vi@ 3 /gc higher than yester
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 600 cars.
â  OATS â \V ere benefited by the better feeling in
Other, grains, but further ihau a slight gain in
sympathy there was no evidence of individual
improvement. Thoman gave a favorable report
on this grain. â¢ Receipts were 405 cars, and 90,000
bushels were taken from score. Export clearances
were large at 455,086 bushels, madstreet's re
ported an increase in available stocks of 124,000

' Twins.
All the world likes to see a liar caught in
the lie. No one regrets when the parent
who tries to palm off a ear-old child as
only 9, in order to escape paying a full
fare, is corrected by the child himself. In
the following case, which a London paper
relates, it was the mother herself who be
trayed the truth:
It was at the railroad station, and she
was trying .to buy half-fare tickets for. her
two children.
"How old are they?" asked the ticket
seller. - : â¢
"Only 6." ,
"Both of them?" ,
r "Yes; they's twins."
"Ah!" said the man. He eyed them a
moment and then said: "Pretty children.
Where were they born ?"
"This one in London," answered the
proud mother, "and the other in
.Brighton!"â Youth's Companion.

tails of the Railroad
Compromise.

What the Company Will Give
and Do in Return for Other
Favors.
OPEN STREETS TO WATER FRONT
Rights of Way Will Be Given to
Some if Others Are Kept
C'csed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June M. |
The Southern Pacific is anxious to make
a compromise with the City oi Oakland in
recard to the opening of streets to the
water front.
The extension of these streets is of the
greatest importance to property-owners in
tho neighborhood, and the result is being
eagerly watched. Councilman Towle. who
â was appointed chairman of the special
committee appointed to confer with the
railroad officials, has. received the follow
ing letter, which will be openly discussed
at the next meeting of tne City Council:
To the Hono-abU Special Street Committee of
the Oakland cry Councilâ Gentlemen: Acting
upon ycur p â¢.-. si i i ihe 27tn inst., at our in
terview-in nation to street-opening in the
city Cf Oakland, through property owned by
cur various railway lines find the Pacific Im
provement Company, we bt g to resp ctfully
submit to you and through you to ihe City
Council oi your tilv the following offer by
way of compromise torexlsting differences be
tween ourselves and the city upon this sub
ject, with the hope that it will be received
by you in the same iriendly spirit in which it
Is made.
We most unhesitatingly affirm that the in
terests of the city of Oakland and our railway
companies, located within iis limits, are iden
tical, and any line of action which will result
in the injury to the one will unfavorably affect
the other, and hence ordinary business pru
dence would suggest that the railway compa
nies should not interpose any objection to ihe
upbuilding of the city, and the opening of her
streets to the waterways which surround her,
nor should the officers of the city government
lay unnecessary burdens upon the city's rail
way traffic by opening streets through the
railway yards or depot grounds, unless such
openings are absolutely necessary In the inter
est of public travel and commercial iuter
course.
In order to correct an impression which
Eeems to have gained some currency in your
city, that these companies and their allied in
terests have been attempting to maintain a
"Chinese wall" upon the city's boundaries, we
hereby offer to deed to the city of Oakland for
the consideration of $1 a right-of-way across
our grounds and tracks, commencing at and
Including B street on the northeast, together
â with Twenty-sixth street, Twenty-fifth street,
Twenty-fourth street, Twen<y-third street,
Twenty-second street, Twenty-first itreet,
â¢ Twentieth street, Fourteenth street. Thir
teenth street, Twelfth street, Eleventh street,
and what we believe is called Lincoln street,
â which comprises every street on the north
vest shore of the city, except Seventeenth,
tlehteenin and Nineteenth streets.
Seventeenth and Eighteenth streets run
risht through our depot grounds at Sixteenth-
Btreet station, and the opening of the latter
street would require us to move our freight
depot. The opening of Seventeenth street
across our network of tracks and freight yard
would seriously discommode the handling of
our trains, both freight and passenger, at that
point, and in no apparent degree tnat we can
discover would it conserve the public interest.
So far as Nineteenth street is concerned, we
do not seriously object to opening this street
also. If, in the opinion of the Council, this
street should be incuided, although many
â  trains reaching Sixteenth street extend across
Nineteentn street as projected. It may there
fore be considered that upon the north side
we only object to the opening of Seventeenth
and Eighteenth streets. We also wish to add
and hereby offer wheuever either the city or
adjoining owners desire to open Seventeenth
street to our depot grounds, which are in fÂ«ct
devoted to a public use ana used by the public
in hauling freight and passengers to and from
onr depot, that we will at our own expense
and without charge to the city, fill in and put
Nineteenth street in good order from our
depot grounds to Wood street. It will also be
bor.ne in mind by your honorable body that in
the projection of Fourteenth, Thirteenth,
Twelfth and Eleventh streets to the Peralta
line westerly, a very serious Impediment is
now about to be filled by us without any cost
to the city, which will render these streets ac
cessible to travel without the use of any money
by the city.
We also offer to deed the right of way across
our grounds for Market street on the south, at
the er.d of which is now located a very com
modious wharf, but we object to the opening
of Castro and Brush streets for the following
and no other reasons: Brush street is only
about 100 feet from Market street at the inter
action of Firit street, and if opened from that
point to the Peralta line would necessitate the
removal of our depot from there to some more
remote quarter of the city, which would se
riously inconvenience both the railroad com
pany and its patrons. The piece of ground
through which Castro and Brush street would
run it opened as projected, lying between
First street and the Peralta grant line, is fitted
lor & freight depot ot some considerable mag
nitude whenever the necessities of the city re
quire an extension of her freighting facilities
Â»t that point, and to open these two streets or
either of them through this tract, which Is al
ready too small of itself, would entirely de
stroy it lor the use contemplated.
>\e be? also respectfollv to suggest that
with Market street opened to the water-front
on the west and the other streets to ihe" eaÂ«t
\iard.no serious impediment can possibly be
Buffered by th u public ct all comparable with
the injury which the opening of these two
(streets wouia inflict upon the railroad com
pany ; and it is confidently believed by us that
it le tneearr.tst desire of your honorable body
not to unnecessarily nflict hardship upon
either persons or corporations within your
jurisdiction unless public necessity demands
Bucn act.on ana then only that such demand
is urgent and pressing.
We believe tntg offer covers the subject-mat
ter of our discussion upon Saturday, leaving to
future negotiation, and adjustment some un
opened streets which involve the territory now
!n litigation between the city and the water
front company, which were not embraced
â¢within the range of our present negotiations.
We trust, however, thm those streets also may
be subject of adjustment upon the same lines
which have thus far seemed to actuate all par
ties to the present controversy.
We wish to. add, in conclusion, that the of
ficers of our company upon whom devolved
the duty ot seeking a settlement of the street
matters in issue were highly gratified by the
spirit of candor and fairness which wns t-'xhib
ln-d by your committee in seeking an amicable
adjustment of this matter, arm only regret
thut through pressing businc-s engagements
H. E. Huntington and Julius Kruttschnltt
were prevented from being present In person
and taking part in the proceeding". Very re
spectfully, W. Â«... Curtis.

Â§08 Broadway, June 30. )
The Oakland City Christian Endeavor
Union has jus. completed its first year of i
work and has prepared a very interesting '
. i
i report. The chapter of greatest interest
is that relating to a branch of work which
ha 3 been made successful for the first time
in the State â the Endeavor working
, amoug electric road carmen.
In this regard the greatest progress has
been made with the employeÃ of tne great
j Oakland and Berkeley consolidated sys-
I tern. Part of the success is due to the
sympathy shown in the woric by the
| officials of the road. The directors of the
j road have rented rooms near the power-
I house: and fitted them up for tha use of
i the employes of the road. This has been
i done under the direction of Assistant
! Superintendent Gilbert Robertson, who
j has been elected treasurer of the city
| union.
The carmen gather in the reading-room
every Tuesday afternoon and Thursday
evening, and addresses are made by both
I pastors and laymen. The iilndeavorers
, take charge ana the railroad is certainly
I fortunate in Having so many men in their
employ who are pledged to lead Christian
lives.
There is also a reading-room in connec
tion with the work, which is supplied
i with up-to-date literature and periodicals,
I and is largely patronized. Chess, checkers
! and dominoes are also supplied and many
carmen who are not Endeavorers visit the
place and naturally are influenced by their
surroundings.
During the coming year a special effort
will be mads to organize a work among
I the employes of the Piedmont, Telegraph
! avenue. San Pablo-tvenue and Twelfth
, street lines.
"Our first year of work has been a great
! success," said H. J. Waters, the newly
elected president, to-day. "It is the first
time the Endeavorers have inaugurated a
wort among carmen, and the result shows
that it was justified. I have just returned
from an Eastern trip, and have gathered
j many new ideas which will soon be put in
use. The Berkeley road is very fortunate
, in having such a lot of men who show an
interest in Endeavor worn and who help
it along and make it the success it deserves
to be. We are going to take up several
i fields of work that have been neglected,
THE NEW EXPOSITION BUILDING AND THE OFFICERS IN CHARGE.
and shpll take an active part in city evan
gelization during the coming year."
About forty different societies represent
ing a membership of about HOOO, constitute
the City union which is one of the largest
and most progressive in the State. The
officers for the year now commenced are,

HE WAS WORKED NICELY
City Attorney J. C. Brainard of
Redding in a Bad
Light.
The Footrace Sw'nd'e at Shell Mound
Was Worktd by Friends cf
Goldbrick Gordon.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 30. )
The men under arrest for working the
footrace swindle at Shell Mound Park
last Saturday on O. H. Williams, a Red
dine mining man, to the extent of $500,
were arraigned before Justice Clift this
morning. Their attorneys were very
anxious to have the caic postponed until
August 4, but Deputy District Attorney
Carl Wood refused to let them go over
later than July 22.
Accordi ng to the story of Williams the
scheme was wonted very Bmoothly upon
him, and he accuses City Attorney J. C.
Brainard of Redding, who was his par
ticular friend, with aiding the sharpers in
their scheme to fleece him and has sworn
to a complaint for bis arrest and also for
one Charles Ryan, who is wanted for com
plicity in the affair. Williams tells the
following story:
"Brainard and Ryan came to me regard
ing a footrace between the latter and a man
whom they called Mill?, but is now
known as McDonald. I did not want to
iÂ»ut up any money, but they insisted that
I back McDonald, as I c could easily de
feat Kvan and the money was needed to
be 'P.ns'heil.' As I had perfect colidence in
Brainard, who had been my attorney in
several suits at Redding, 1 agreed to put
up the money in his hands. Walter Rob
inson and another Redding man were to be
referee 5 . When they first started Robin
son called them back, sayin t it was a
(Msa stnrt. McDonald stopped, but Ryan
went on and completed the race. He re
turned and claimed the money.
"Schaffer came up and took the money.
Brainard claimed that Schaffer grabbed
it out of his hand and he (Brainard) pulled
out iiis pistol, but put it back when Rv?.n
sairl that it was all right. Brainard told
me that he would have tne man arrested,
and he made an appointment with me
about the matter, but I could not find him
afterward."
Ryan, the missing footracer, is said to
have only just b?en released from jail for
a similar muddle in San Francisco. He
has been a regular caller on "Big Foot',
Dave Gordon of gold-brick fame, aud it Is
believed that they all belong to one gang
of s>ure-thing swindlers. His description
will be forwarded to all officers in the
State.
Attorney Brainard, who is accused
with the others wit^h Dunkoing Williams,
obtained sonic notoriety some years ago
by shooting another attorney by the name
of Nagle. during the trial of a case in Red
Bluff. The two men were relatives, but
nevertheless quarreled, ami Brainard
claimed that Nagle attacked him with a
chair. He was acquitted by a jury. The
Nagle, who was killed, was a brother of
Charles Nagle, who defended Louia Muhl
ner in his trial on the charge of murdering
Jennie Lewis.

GAVIN DHU HIGH
GUILTY Of LIBEL,
Verdict Reached in the Sen
sational Suit at Mid
night.
AN INFLUENTIAL LOBBY
Attorney W. W. Foote Explains
Why He Went Into the
Case.
LIFELONG FRIEND OF DINGEE.
The Editor Is Dissatisfied With the
Verdict and Wants a
New Trial.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 30.â A little be
fore midnight Gavin Dhu High, editor of
the Times, was found guilty of criminal
libel. The jury was out two and a half
hours and when they agreed on a verdict
it was "guilty as charged."
When court assembled Attorney W. W.
Foote stated that he had been unable to
secure the attendance of Major Loucke,
whom he had hoped would impeach
High's testimony, and said he would pro
ceed without it.
District Attorney Church addressed the
jury and reviewed the evidence for the
prosecution. He referred to High's
record and to the apparent unreliability
of his testimony, which he claimed was
entirely unsupported, and said that the
article was a positive libel on Mr. Dingee.
Attorney Heatty address d the jury on
b half of High and carefully went over
each of the facts. He referred to High as
a youth who was likely to make mistakes
and argued that the statements in the
article were substantially true. He con
cluded by advising the jury not to be led
away by the sophistry and eloquence of
Mr. Foote.
W. W. Foote made the closing argument
for the prosecution. He made particular
reference to the personal character of the
defendant. "Counsel for the defense,"
said Mr. Foote, "cast aspersions on my
motive for being at this trial. I am here
out of friendship for Mr. Dingee. I have
known him for twenty-five years, and I
have admired him all that time. I would
anpear for any friend who was so mali
ciously slandered.
"Mr. Dingee has been called a thief by
a professional blackmailer. He has been
forced to go to his home and be met by
his wife and children after being branded
â¢s a thief. We must be protected from
this. The only protection is with a jury.
Formerly when a man was treated in this
way he vindicated his character with a
shotgun. That age is past and we now
resort to law. If Mr. Dingee cannot get
redress from a jury of men who have
known him for twenty years, where ia he
to get it? By a shotgun?"
The jury returned into court twice for
instructions, but at 11:45 agreed on a ver
dict ot guilty.
The trial has caused more excitement
than any tried in the Police Court for
many years on account of the prominence
of the men involved. At to-night's session
the lobby was as influential as any that
could be gathered from the banking, com
mercial or legal circles in Oakland. Many
came on purpose to hear Mr. Foote's argu
ment, but he was very moderate and spoke
only fifteen minutes.
Durin.' the recess Mr. High showed a
dispatch that he had receired from T. H.
Goodman, stating that Major Loucke was
with an excursion in the interior of the
State, but that he (Loucke) had stated
that he had no criminal charge to press
against High and would not aid in any.
The dispatch was shown to Foote, who
said: "Well, there's no denial of the
facts. Loucke don't believe in suits for
the infamous crime with which I charged
High. He told me that if lie ran across
High he would shoot him."
After the verdict bad been rendered
Judge Wood said he would pronounce
sentence on Monday next High will
apply for a new trial.

IS YOUNG, BUT A LEADER,
T. G. Brown sod, the New Presi
dent of California Col
lege, Arrives
His Policy Will Be Aggressive.
Something of His Cireer Starting
From the Soil.
EAST OAKLAND, Cal., June3o.âPresi
| clent T. G. Brownson arrived from Oregon
j yesterday. He lately resigned the presi
dency of McMinnville College in that State
to take the position of president in the
Baptist College " here in East Oakland.
T. Q. BROWNSON, PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE, EAST OAKLAND.
I Professor Brownson is Jcomparatively a
j young man. He is nbout 45 years old and
I must tip the scale at something over 200
pounds. A characler-reader would size
him up as a man of keen business ability.
! a born leader, and a man of strong will
! and unflinching determination. Coupled
; with these sterner qualities there is a quiet
twinkle in his eyes at times showing his
ability to appreciate the humorous, and
withal is possessed of a power of mak-
J ing himself appear interested in those
| with whom he talks. It is safe to predict
that it will not be long after the college
opens in the fall till the sympathies ot the
students are with him.
Professor Brownson was born in Afton,
! Broom County, N. V., in 1851, where he
j spent his early life on a farm. After
I leaving the public school he went to Dela- j
ware Literary Institute, Franklyn, N. Y.
j From there he went to Colgate University,
j and while there took two first prizes for j
i essays in English composition. Besides j
this he took second prize with an essay in
tha intercollegiate competition. Two
years were then spent in Hamilton Theo-
I logical Seminary. Receiving a call to
! preach in Three Rivers, Mich., he went ,
j there and was ordained. It was during :
i his three years' pastorate in this place that ',
! he married. His wife's maiden name was
! Miss M. Franc Havden. She was born In
i Port Byron, N. Y. From Three Rivers
Professor Brownson entered the Baptist
Union Theological Seminary of Chicago
and was graduated from there in 1883, but
pursued post-graduate studies for some
time afterward. In 1884 he became pastor
of the Baptist church in Albany, Or.
Three years later he was called to the j
j presidency of McMinnville College. Dur- j
( ing his stay there the income of the college :
: was increased nearly 200 per cent. There |
| was also a large increase in the number of
! books in the librnry and observatory and
gymnasium buildings were erected. The
observatory contains the finest telescope
north of San Francisco. The permanent
funds of the college were also largely in
creased during his presidency. President
! Brownson has contributed largely to the
I Baptist papers in the East, and while in
MoMinnville he wrote an e3^ay on "The !
Duty of Yo.ing People to Obtain the Best
Education Possible." This was in com
petition for a prize offered by the American
Baptist Educational Society, which he
won. He has held a prominent place in
all educational phases of Oregon State
work, and very few men havevi-ited more
of the educational institutions in the
United States than he has. He has left j
McMinnville College in an excellent con- j
dition.
His conviction is that California College
has an admirable location, and one of tbc
things which led him herÂ© is tne firm j
belief which he possesses that California
College has a large future before it. Pro- i
fessor Brownson enters into the labors of j
Dr. Morse, and his record at McMinnville
assures that he will place a superstructure
upon the foundation so excellently laia by
Dr. Morse that will be permanent and
lasting. Mrs. . Brownson, his wife, has
taught French for a number of years at
Albany, N. V., and will take up the classes
in French and German. Pr sident
Brownson will teach the advanced Latin.
The disposition of the trustees is to
secure as strong a faculty as possible so
that the college will be bstter equipped for
teaching than ever before. President
Brownson's financial policy will be an
aggressive one and from his past record no
doubt need exist but that It will be a
successful one.

YOUNG MEN JUBILANT.
Progress Toward Drmoli*hlng the As
sociation Building Debt
Celebrated.
The members of the Young Men's
Christian Association held a jubilee social
in the parlors of their building last even
ing to express their joy at the progress
made so far in paying off the building debt.
J. L. Spears, the State president of the as
sociation, was present and made a brief
address of congratulation and admoni
tion. Secretary McCoy and other promi
nent members of the organization made
remarks.
An informal programme was enacted,
after which the evening was spent in so
cial conversation.
CERTIFICATES POSTPONED.
Inspection of Meat for Export Kxtended
"â¢ Another Twelve Months.
The act recently passed by Congress re
quiring Government inspection of all meat :
intended for export, and which was to
have become generally operative to-day,
has been extended in part at least until
March 15, 1897. The Federal authorities
have found it impracticable for the present i
at lea<t to extend the service to all cities, !
and accordingly they have issued the fol- i
lowing circular, which was received by
Collector Wise yesterday :
It is ordered that the requirements of cer
tificates shall be postponed until March 15,
1897. All orders and regulations of this de
partment inconsistent with this order are
hereby repealed.
The greater part of exported beef Is now
in-pect>:d and will be certified, and any Gov
ernment desiring to secure inspected beef ex
clusively may ao so by mnking the proper i
regulations. It is not, however, deemed prac- i
tioftble to exclude from exportation to coun- I
tries which gladiy accept itthe beef which the \
retail butchers find unsalable because it is cut
from inferior portions of the carcase. Much of
this beef has been inspected, but there is no
\fay of identifying it after the carcase has been '
cut.
As a considerable number of firms collect
these special cuts from the retailers and pack
them tor exportation, to enforce the statute as
It stands would destroy their business. An
amendment to tlie law which will avoid this
undesirable result has been favorably reported
from tlie proper committee iv each branch of j
Congress and I deem it my duty to postpone ;
the order requiring certificates until this bill i
has been duly considered and acted upon by
the law-making power of the Government

HIS WHITE HAT
WAS A HOODOO,
D. J. McCarty Files a
Petition in Insol
vency.
FOR TWENTY THOUSAND
Has Not a Dollar With Which
to Reimburse His Cred
itors.
PRISE CAME BEFORE A FALL.
End of a Bitter Struggle With Fate
Which Continued Through
Many Years.
"The King is dead! Long live the
King!"
He was not a real king and is not really
dead, but he is deceased financially, which
fate all men acknowledge is almost as un
welcome as the advent of the reaper.
During his financial life he was "king of
the turf" ana proudly wore his letters
patent on the lapel of his vest. "White
Hat I," he was surnamed McCarty;
founder of a house of cards, progenitor
of a line of sportsmen, owner of an Ameri
can derby-winner, friend of a psuedo lord
of England's iealm. Who knew him not?
Certainly nobody who is anybody in the
world of sport.
And now he is a dead one. For years
he battled against fate. He paid no man
his due excepting the hard-hearted but
aitute one who obtained spot-cash for
goods delivered. Judgments he feared
not. Sheriffs officers were as children in
his hands. His silvery speech coined gold
for him and his Irish wit cajoled dollars, as
if by magic, from the pockets of all manner
ot men.
But all thiDgs must have an end. In an
unguarded moment Dan proclaimed him
self the owner of a coach, presented to
him by his titled friend.
McCarty's lips had hardly ottered the
words before an army of nis creditors were
on their way to the Sheriff's office to attach
the only valuable McCarty asset heard of
in years. Within a day the polished sur
face of the "Meteor" could hardly be seen
foi the attachments plastered on it.
Dan at once hedged, but aias, too late. A
visible asset had been discovered, and the
cries of clamoring creditors rose so loud
that he was forced into bankruptcy, and
yesterday D. J. McCarty's name appeared
on a petition in insolvency.
The horseman acknowledges that he
owes $21,762, and is equally frank in stat
ing that his assets are well represented by
a cipher. The principal creditor men
tioned is the Bank of California, from
which institution McCarty borrowed
$3000 on a promissory note.
The transaction took place so long ago
that the exact date is forgotten, but Dan
confidently states that it was in '91 or
'92. J. W. Bradbury is a creditor to the
extent of $1500, for which he obtained
judgment. Another judgment for $1500 is
held by J. E. Snain.
Irwin C. Slump loaned the petitioner
$3500 on a promissory note which has
never been taicen up. Gilbert Tompkins
parted with $6000 for a similar bit of paper.
C. H. King also accepted a written prom
ise to pay in lieu of $2500. Smaller suras
amounting to about $3500 are a-so men
tioned.
All that MoCarty claims to own is
about $300 worth of furniture in his home
on Harrison street, waich is exempt from
execution.
CONSUL SERRA ARRIVES,
Prominent Italians of This City
Welcome Grimaldi's

Regarded as One of the Brightest Men

Service.
Chevalier Avocato Carlo Philip Serra,
the newly appointed Italian Consul-Gen

mieri. Chevalier G. Calegaris, president of
the Italian Chamber of Commerce.
Chevalier Serra is a comparatively young
man, being about 40 years of age, and is a
native of Genoa. He has held the posi
tion of First Vice-Consul at Philadelphia,
and was appointed to the consulate in this
City while on a vacation trip to Rome.
It was intended to appoint him to the
consulate of New Orleans, but the position
of Consul at San Francisco becoming va
cant, he was appointed to that position.
Cb-valier Serra and his wife, who is an
American !ady from Baltimore, will re
side at the Occidental Hotel.
The new Consul is considered one of the
brightest and ablest men in the Italian
consular service. In the local consulate
he succeeds Chevalier Bruni Grimaldi,
who left twenty-two days ago for Guate
mala. Since his departure Dr. Pescia has
occupied the petition of acting Consul.
Chevalier Serra will take his seat as Con
sul this morning, and will enter upon his
consular duties at the old headquarters of
the Italian Consul at Washington and
Battery streets, in the same building with
the Italian Chamber of Commerce.
THE ENDEAVORERS.
Exhibition of Professor Kelchner's
Model I. ait Evening for the Ben
efit of the Organization.
A novel and most interesting entertain
> rueut came off at Calvary Presbyterian
Church, at the corner of Powell and Geary
streets, last evening. It was tne pxhibi
tion of a beautiful miniature of the Mosaic
tabernacle as carried by the Israelites in
their wanderings through the wilderness.
The model faithfully represents its orig-
I inul, and is said to have been constructed
at an outlay of $15,000. Gold and silver,
silk and costly linen were plentifully used
in its construction, and some of the pre
j cious utensils and rugs were made in Pal-
I estine. The model contains 1700 pieces
and weighs 1200 pounds.
Back of the Tabernacle stands a large
painting of Mount Sinai, the great peak
lining out in bold relief, and on the plain
iat its Dese are tne tents of Israel. The
I whole structure is about one-eleventh the
size of the original.
It is the work of Professor J. W. Kelch
ner, who lectures upon the history of the
first Jewish temple of worship. He is ex
! hibiting the model throughout the State
! for the purpose of raising money to pay
the expenses of the National Convention
of the Christum Endeavor Society, which
will meet in San Francisco next year.
After the exhibition the Endeavorers
held a meeting and a number of speeches
were made by members of the society upon
! the future work of the organization. The
I National Convention next year, which
would bring a large body of the member
ship of the order to this City and the ex
penses of that gathering must De met.
The meeting was an enthusiastic one, and
many pledged their personal assistance to
I the cause.
GAY BOBBY MITCHELL
He Will Be Given a "Send-Off"
by His Numerous
Friends.
"The Father of Frisco's Orphans"
Met With a Severe Accident and
Will Be Cared For.
Trie Olympic Club boys, joined by the
Bay City Wheelmen, Olympic Cyclers,
Stanford and Mission parlors; N. S. G. W.,
the Y. M. I. and the members of the Cor
inthian Yacht Club, will give "Bob"
Mitchell a great "send-off" to-night at Na
tive Sons' Hall, on Mason street.
"Bob" Mitchell is known just as well by
the title of the "Chinese prima donna,"
whose shrill notes, clever dialect and ele
gant Chinese costumes have been heard
and seen on every stage in this City where
performances have been given for chari
table purposes.
As chief end-man of the Olympic Club
minstrels, he contributed his share of
mirth to the peoole who paid in their
money for the benefit of the Children's
Hospital. In some other role be did as
much for other deserving causes, and, so it
baa been for years, until good-natured
"Bob" has been saddled with the sobriquet
of '"Father of Frisco's Orphans."
"Bob" met with an accident so:ne time
ago and the send-off alluded to is simply
paving the way to the hospital, where he
is to be operated upon.
He fell down a rickety flight of stairs
when he and a remainder of a relief com
mittee of Good Samaritans were taking
provisions to a sick mother and dying
child, and be injured his spine.
Tne artists who will assist to-night in
making enough money for the "Father of
Frisco'? Orphans" to go and be cut up by
the doctors are :
Miss Don Cann, late ot the Jerry Com
pany; Pearl Ladd, the cnild prodigy and
piano virtuoso; James Swinnertoui char
coal sketches; Baltian Quartet (Flood,
Orcott, Hamburger and Duncan); W. H.
Hallett and Ben Tarbox, barytones; Billy
Hynes, Alex Rosborough and Jack Cath
cart, comedians. As a wind-up, George
Green, better known as "Young Corbett,"
the champion welter-weight of the Pacific
Coast, will spar three rounds with Jack
Seidman of Boston.
One feature which shows the popularity
of "Bob" Mitchell and bow he has en
deared himself to everybody is that the
Musicians' Union has broken one of its
cardinal rules and J. M. Blancbard will be
leader of an orchestra playing purely for
friendship.

Garret McEnerney Engaged to
Miss Elizabeth
Hogan.
The Attorney's Prospective Bride
Well Known Here and in
Napa.
Garret McEnerney, one of San Fran
cisco's brightest and most successful at
torneys, is soon to take unto himself a
wife. The story of Mr. McEnerney's en
gagement to Miss Elizabeth Hogan of 700
Jones street has been whispered among
the friends of the young people for some
time, but it was not until the last few
days that rumors of an early marriage
transpired.
At Mr. McEnerney's residence it was
declared that the time and place of the
ceremony have not yet been decided upon,
but it is known that it will be a matter of
a few weeks only.
The prospective bride, although at pres
ent a resident of this City, is well known
in Napa, where she previously resided.
Her relatives are prominent in that local
ity, and Miss Hogun was one of the most
popular young ladies in Napa society.
Mr. McEnrrney is well known socially

Daniel Defoe Jr., the great-great-preat

character Robinson Crusoe, is dead. The

famous by reason of the stirring trials and
privations encountered by the monarch of
DANIEL DEFOE JR. AS HE APPEARED ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THIS CITY.
the sea-girt isle, along with his man Fri
day, passed away at the Receiving Hos
pital yesterday morning at 1 o'clock.
Defoe's principal trouble was consump
tion, though be might have lived to a fair
a?e, but for his love of strong drink. He
arrived here April 10 as an apprentice boy
on board the British ship Bass Rock. He
liked San Francisco, and at the first op
portunity left his ship. Since that
time he bas been known as John Harris.
Under the latter name he was carried to
the Receiving Hospital Monday after
noon, death relieving his sufferings some
hours later. At the Morgue yesterday
afternoon be was identified by James
Hunter and Charles Rogers as Daniel De
foe, the ex-apprentice boy.
The young sailor was 20 years of age and
the lact scion of the family whose name
was made illustrious by the great political
writer and novelist. So anxious was his
father, who Was also christened Daniel, to
perpetuate the name that the oldest son

f hutcgraph Presented to Tom Gregory.
was given it. Nor did the effort stop at
that, for the second boy was called Daniel
Defoe Defoe. And still the name went on,
for the third son was christened Daniel
Defoe.
The spectacle of three living brothers
bearing almost the same name was a re
markable one. However, they died in
their early childhood and the family title
was again in jeopardy, as the remaining
three children were girls. In their old age
a fourth son was born to the Defoes, and
he was given the name of his great-great
great-grandfather, oi his father and of his
dead brothers.
Daniel Defoe â many times â Jr., being
left an orphan at an early age, was edu
cated at the celebrated "Blnecoat School"
at Christ's Hospital, London. He re
ceived the warrant of an apprentice in the
merchant service, and visited thin port in
the British ship Prior Hill in 1890. Dur
ing his five or six years of sea life young
Defoe has been in many parts of the
world, and has become personally known
to the readers of his celebrated ancestor
wherever the English language is spoken.
â¢'The press, both in England and
abroad, have written me up pretty thor
oughly," said he to a Call reporter a day
or two after his arrival.
"A year or two ago, when I â¢uime home,
I saw on London Bridge a big handbill
stating that Daniel Defoe, the grandson of
the threat novelist, like Robinson Crusoe,
had returned from foreign lands and would
appear In some entertainment. Some
shrewd fellow was evidently faking my
name for his show.
"I once visited San Juan Fernandez
Island, and while ashore on that almost
barren place tried to understand what my
great-great-great-grand-dad found in Alex
ander Selkirk's adventures to inspire the
Robin3DU Crusoe yarn. I read the book
once, and I can't say that I admired it
much. No, that novel didn't send me to
sea. Captain Marryatt did that for me.
His characters are much more to my
taste than 'Man Friday' and the goats and
parrots of my relative.
"Chopping out canoes from tree-trunks
and raising nelas of bai-lev from a few
seeds is hardly to my taste. 1 would
rather read 'Peter Simple,' 'Midshipman
Easy' and 'Jacob Faithful.' However, it
isn't quite in good taste and is rather a
family disloyalty for Defoe Jr. to speak of
Deioe Sr. in this style."
Young Defoe is said to have rich rela
tives in England. They were notified of
his death by the British Consul of this
port yesterday.
Fractured His Nose.
James Kidd, a Jockey at the Ingleslde race
tracic, has been seized with the pugilistic
fever. Last night he put on the gloves to have
a friendly set-to with a friend, and the friend
punched him fo hard on the nose ihat he
fractured it. Kidd went to the Receiving
Hospital and Dr. Fitzgibbon put his nose in
shape again.

J D. Sprfckels, Delegate at Large, and
Samuel M Shortridge Return
Home.
Joseph S. Spear, who returned from his
political pilgrimage to Mark Hanna at
Cleveland, William McKinley at Canton,
Ohio, and the Republican Convention at
St. Louis Monday night, was enjoying the
congratulations of his numerous political
and business friends at bis office all day
yesterday, and when seen at the Palace
Hotel last night was recuperating from
the fatigue of the dsy in the comforts of
his room.
What most impressed on his return, he
said, wa3 the way in which his Democratic
friends of downtown â his business neigh
borsâgreeted him and promised him their
support for McX nlay and protection.
Briefly he outlined his journeyings
while away, his wife being his close com
panion everywhere.
"When we left here,' 1 he said, "we went
direct to Cleveland. Ohio. While we were
there Mrs. Spear and myself were enter
tained at the home of Mr. Hanna. When
Mr. McKinley heard we were there he sent
a telegram asking us to come and visit
him at his home in Canton. So we went
down and remained with him two days.
"Politics were only talked of in a gen
eral way at both tne home of Hanna and
of McKinley. We knew at that time from
the statistics that we had that McKinley
would be nominated on the first ballot,
though we did not look for so large a ma
jority as he subsequently received.
"We discussed the monetary situation
of course, for that subject was discussed
everywhere we went, and our talk ended
in favor of a plank exactly like the one
that now appears in the platform of the
Republican National Convention.
"From Canton we went on to St. Louis,
so as to be there when ihe National Com
mittee met, because we wanted to spo
about our contest. We were successful,
as was telegraphed out here at the timeâ
that is, Mr. Kowalsky and myself were
seated.
"As far as the silver question is con
cerned." said Mr. Gear, "I don't think it
will affect the election of McKinley in the
least. 1 have talked with prominent peo
ple all the way from Cleveland to San
Francisco, and as the results of these con
versations 1 think the silver question is
only a dodge of the Democrats to try to
beat McKinley and protection, as tney
have fouii'l that a free-trade light would
be a sure losing proposition,
"Colorado, in particular, and all the sil- |
ver States are of course for silver, but their i
course is actuated by pure selfishness. |
This State will be for McKinley as sure as
the sun rises. Caliiornia is not a silver
State in any sense of the word, and I find
that the more the question is discussed
the more people see the illogicality of a
double standard.
"I stopped in Colorado Springs on my
way West and met several of tne promi
nent people of that place. They assured
me ti.at El Paso County, Colo., the county
in which are located Colorado Springs,
Manitou Springs and Cripple Creek, will
go for McKinley. 1 found any quantity of I
men there who wore McKinley buttons,

ton I spoke to in order to ascertain

in nearly every casÂ»- he pro\ed to be a resi
dent.
"An incidenr in Colorado that greatly
amused me was the lament of Senator
Wolcott, who had just returned home and
whom I met in Denver. Relating his ex
perience to me he said: 'I suppose the
aight Senator Teller gets home he will be
met by three-fourths of the State. When
I got home tnere was no one to greet me
tut the colored porter.'
"After the convention we remained in
Si. Louis a couple of days to see the ruins
in the cyclone district. It was a horrible
sight. Blocks on blocks of brick and
stone buildings razed flat to the ground as
if they had been made of cardboard. We
spent a whole day going through the dis
trict.
"Thence wa returned home in easy
stagss, stopping at Kansas City, Denver,
Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs and
Sait Lake. We also went to the top of
Pikeb Feak.
"All Denver is nearly insane on the sil
ver proposition, yet I noticed that siiver
was vÂ«ry scarce .there. I bought some
cigars and tendered a $10 bill in payment,
and the man had to send out for silver to
make tie change. This suggested an idea
to me. I asked my wife to take a walk
with me down Sixteenth street, the main
artery of the retail section. We entered
thirty-six stores and tried in each to get
silver in exchange lor a $10 bill. In only
two place? could we be accommodated.
From this I judge that even the silver
maniacs are averse to the actuai use of
silver in large quantities as a medium of
commercial exchange.
"If there is a sincere desire to appreci
ate the value of silver its vociferous friends
should seek to have all DanK notes under
the denomination of $10 withdrawn. This
would create a demand for silver that
would quicKly absorb all tne builion now
lying idle and useless in the vaults of the
treasury and cause the price of the white
metal to go up with a jump."
John D. Spreckels, one of the California
delegates at lareef to the Republican Na
tional Convention, returned home last
night. He was too wearied by his long
railroad ride to talk of his experiences and
impressions while away.
Samuel M. Rhortridge returned in com
pany with Mr. Spreckels. and he, too, was
too fatigued to be interviewed.
Hl* Bonds Forfeited.
Levi R. Gordon, ex-policeman, charged with
petty larceny in stealing milk in the Western
Addition, failed to appear when his case was
called in Judge Con Inn's court yesterday
morning. Gordon was out on $200 bonds and
the Judge declared the bonds forfeited and
issued a bencu warrant tor his arrest. The
bondsmen are W. A. McKenzie, '207 Eddy

John T. Bigelow, 813 Bryant street, swore to

Leonards on the charge of grand larceny.
Bigrelow alleges that Leonards called at tils
