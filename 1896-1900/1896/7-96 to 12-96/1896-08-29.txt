Met by General Ruger and Escorted

York Streets.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 28. -Li Hung
Chang, Viceroy of China, Embassador
Extraordinary to Russia and world-re
nowned diplomat, arrived in New York
to-day and became the guest of the Na
tion. The stately St. Louis passed Fire
Island at 10:33 a. h. with the distinguished
Tisitor on board. The steamer made the
trip from Southampton in six days and
three hours. She was saluted by the
tooting of whistles, tugs and steamers as
she passed up the lower Day and entered
the Narrows.
The day was ft perfect one. Bright sun
light overhead, an atmosphere clear as
crystal with a tinse of autumn coolness in
it and a light breeze that ruffled the sur
face of the bay combined to make the first
view that Li Hung Chang had of the har
bor of the metropolis a pleasant one.
Added to its natural beauties was the im
posing spectacle furnished by the pres
ence of the finest fleet of warships Uncle
Sam has ever gathered together. They
were the best of the new navy and every
vessel was polished and painted and made
ready in Bristol fashion for the reception
of the honored guest.
There was the fine cruiser New York,
flagship of the fleet, with Admiral Buuce
on board ; the cruisers Cincinnati, Colum
bia, Raleigh, Newark, the battle-ships In
diana and Massachusetts, peerless in their
olaft] the Maine, the Texas, the monitors
Amphitrite and Terror; the ram Katahdin
and the dispatch-boat Dolphin, with the
reception committee on board. The men- '
of- war formed in double column, and as
the St. Louis passed between the line sa
luted in turn with the roar of their bat'
teries.
The committee from the Dolphin boarded
the St. Louis off Quarantine and accompa
nied Li Hung Chang to the pier of the
American line at the foot of Fulton street,
where the landing was made.
Preparations for the reception of the fa
mous diplomat had been carefully ar
ranged. Major-General Thomas Ruger,
commander of the Department of the East,
as the personal representative of President
Cleveland, with nis two staff officers, Ma
jor George W. Davis and Captain Mills;
William Rockhill, First Assistant Secre
tary of State, representing his depart
ment; the Chinese Minister, Yang Yu, and
secretary; the Chinese Consul Sze, and a
representative of the United Associated
Presses boarded the United Stales dispatch
boat Dolphin early this morning and
Bteamed down the bay to meet the Em
bassador.

luarantine along the rail of the hurricane
leek could be seen a row of strongly
narked Chinese faces, all eagerly noting
he different objects of interest in tne
larbor. They peered out of their slant
jyes with a look of wondering astonish
ment at the impressive fleet lying idly at
inchor. They talked hurriedly to each
ather and kept continually pointing at the
ieath-dealing naval machines.
At thf; masthead of the St. Louis floated
the imperial colors of China, the yellow
Hae with an immense dragon Doldly out
lined in the center in natural colors, blue,
red, green and yellow.
When the St. Louis came to quarantine
a steam launch was lowered from the
davits of the Dolphin and the receiving
party conveyed over to the big liner.
A score of steam yachts and a dozen or
more excursion steamers passed in and
out among the war vessels and proceeded
down to the Narrows to meet the St. Louis.
From the arrival of the St. Louis in the
upper bay the journey to her wharf was
among a fleet of tugs, steamboats and
yachts filled with people anxious to get a
glimpse of the Chinese EmbassaJor and
suite. At quarantine the health officer's
boat went alongside the St. Louis and Dr.
Boty boarded her immediately after she
passed the Narrows.
It was 12:45 when the launch from the
Dolphin got alongside the gangway and
the reception committee went aboord.
The revenue cutter went alongside and a
detachment of police from the poiice boat
also boarded the steamship. The excur
sionists on the steamboat saluted the dis
tinguished traveler by discharging hun
dreds of packs of firecrackers.
At 12:55 all the steamboats and accom
panying fleet blew a united blast on their
whistles.
At 1 p. m. the St. Louis started up the
bay for the city. The flagship saluted as
the steamship passed her. The guns of
the other warships remained silent.
After General Ruger and party stepped
aboard the St. Louis they went imme
diately to the after drawing-room, where
they were met by Vice-President Wright
of the American line. Li was in his state
room and word was sent to him that the
Government representatives were ready to
meet him. About the big liner were gath
ered craft of every description crowded
wiih people anxious to get a glimpse of
the celebrated visitor. Whistles were
kept going, yachts boomed cannon and on
some of the tuns firecrackers were set off.
Coming by Fort Wadsworth a salute was
fired. As the St Louis passed through
the warships the flagship New York fired
a salute of nineteen guns, which is the
English Lord High Admiral .â â¢ acial rec
ognition.
Li Hung Chang, after a delay of fifteen
minutes, was conducted to the drawing
room by Vice-President Wright and his
interpreter and secretary. He was at
once presented to General Ruger, who
said: "I am directed by the President of
the United States to meet you and extend
to you the freedom of the Nation. I bid
you welcome."
The Viceroy bowed his head and said,
"I thank you for the courtesy."
He wore a dark- blue brocaded surcoat,
opening on to one of paier blue, which
was turned aside to display the yellow rid
ing- jncket. T<i is was completed by a
crimson skirt, which was profusely cov
ered with floral designs. The peacock
feather hung from a red-topped button
crowned mandarin hat and dropped down
to the back of his neck.
Li was formally presented to all present
in the room, some dozen or more. He
shook hands with them all. He was asked
if he would like to slip out on the deck
and look at the harbor as the ship sailed
up, but he motioned that he preferred to
Bit down and talk with those present.
General Ruger took a seat to his left and
the interpreter to the right. The Viceroy
then began to ask questions. He would
like to know if the President of the Re
puollc was in New York. He was told
that he was aDd that he would see him to
rt orrow. To this the Viceroy bowed his
head in acknowledgment.
''The French people," said Li, suddenly
changing the subject, "tried to influence
me to go home by way of Marseilles and
the Suez canal, but I declined, telling
them I wanted to visit the United States."
When the steamer came to Castle Wil
liam a salute was tired. The envoy asked

what it was, and seemed pleased when
told it was in his honor. All along the
water front growds had gathered, and
cheer after cheer went up in honor of the
great Li.
It was 1:20 p. m. when the steamer
touched the pier. Li's sedan chair was
got ready for him, but he turned to the
men and said : "I do not need it I prefer
to walk upon American shores."
At 1:30 p. m., accompanied by the
official party, he left the steamer by a pri
vate gangway and was greeted by the
navy militia, who beat a welcoming tune
upon drums. The party descended from
the upper pier by an elevator, which was
elaborately decorated with Chinese colors,
to the floor below, where another com

WILL SEND A SHIP
OF WAR TO TURKEY.
President Cleveland Decides to
Dispatch the Bancroft to the
Golden Horn.
NEEDED AT CONSTANTINOPLE.
Required to Do Similar Duty to That
of the Guardships of European
Powers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Ang.', 28.â The
President has decided to send a warship to
Constantinople, and the little cadet prac
tice ship Bancroft has been selected as the
first American naval vessel since the rati
fication of the treaty of Paris to pass the
B sphorus and anchor in the Golden
Horn opposite the gardens of the seraglio.
The administration having reached the
decision that the presence of a United
States war vessel was imperatively de
manded at Constantinople to perform
duty similar to that of the euardships
maintained there by England and France
and other European powers, and the
Turkish lawn resting on the treaty of
Paris forbidding a vessel of over six guns
to enter the Bospborus, the Bancroft
alone was found available for the service
required.
It is impossible to learn to-night whether
any assurances have been received from

44 No one has come to ask me for an office/âF rom a
press report of Mr. Bryan's speech at Erie, Pa.
Turkey that Minister Terrill will be per
mitted to have the naval support of a ship
flying the stars and stripes near his lega
tion. It appeared, however, that the ad
ministration has contemplated for some
time the dispatch of the Bancroft to Con
stantinople, as shown by a letter addressed
by Mavroyeni Bey, the Turkish Minister,
to Secretary Olney last January, in which
Mavroyeni says:
"His Excellency, Tewfik Pasha, has just
informed me that the Sublime Porte re
grets that it cannot comply with Mr. Ter
rill's request for permission for the Ban
croft to pass through the strait, that vessel
having been authorized to remain at the
disposal oi the United States legation at
Constantinople.
"Your Excellency knows perfectly well
the earnest and sincere desire of the Im
perial Government to do all in its power to
strengthen, if possible, the ties of friend
ship which unite the two countries, but in
this case a certain fact is involved, to wit:
that only signatory powers of the treaty
of Paris enjoy the right to have vessels of
war permanently at Constantinople at the
orders of their respective embassies. Now
the United States Government does not
appear in the number of signatories of
that treaty. I am, consequently, sure
that your Excellency will be leased to
take the foregoing into consideration.'*
If any reply was made to this letter or if
any correspondence followed or preceded
it that correspondence isnotobtainabbe.
It is believed in naval circles here tbat
the preliminary orders sending the Ban
croft to Constantinople constitute the
first step in the administration programme
to compel Turkey to respect the peremp
tory demand for full and immediate satis
faction for $100,000 indemnity made last
November for the destruction of the
American College and other property at
Harpoot, and a similar demand for the
burning of the college at Marash. It is
believed this will be enfoiced before the
close of the present year.
The cruiser Bancroft's main battery
consists of four 4-inch rapid-fire rifles and
a number of small secondary weapons
and two torpedo tubes. She carries ten
officers and 120 men. In all respects she
is a warship of the highest class in minia
ture, equal in appearance to the finest
vessels in foreign navies. For her size
she is probably the most formidable of
United States naval vessels.

LENCHING OF SICILIANS.
Governor Foster of Louisiana Reports to
the stnfe Department.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 28.-Tbe
report of Governor Foster of Louisiana
upon the lynching of three Sicilians
charged with murder and confined in the
parish jail of Hahn, in Bt. Charles Parish,
just below New Orleans, in respect to
which Baron Fava, the Italian Embassa
dor, in the name of his Government, has
asked reparatiou from the United States,
has just been received at the State Depart
ment. The Governor makes the customary
reply in such cases, that the perpetrators
of the deed are unknown to the authori
ties, who are taking all possible steps in
the matter. This reply was communi
cated to Baron Fava, with an expression
of regret on the part of the United States
Govornment that a subject of the King of
i Italy should have been dealt with in this
> lawless manner.
San Francisco favored.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 28.â 1n the
morning session of the Supreme Lodge of
the Knights of Pythias Representative
Crowley of California introduced a resolu
tion to hold the next biennial conclave at
San Francisco. The name was received
with applause, and referred to the com
mittee having the matter in charge.
While San Francisco is the favorite city
thus far tne feeling of the Supreme Lodge
is that it cannot aftsrd the expense in
cidental to holdincr the conclave bo far
from the center of population. Indian
apolis seems to have tne call among the
members of the outside committee.

ZANZIBAR, Aug. 28.â During the bom
bardment of the palace by the British
warships on Friday the forces of Said
Khalid, the self-proclaimed Su l tan, in and
about the palace numbered 3000. Of this
number it is estimated that fully 500 were
killed or wounded.
The British Consul has asked the Ger
man Consul here to surrender Said Khalid,
the usurper, who took refuge in the Ger
man consulate yesterday after escaping
from the palace during the bombardment
of that building by the British warships
in the harbor.

OAKLAND. Cal., Aug. 28.â While a full
brass band played patriotic music the en
'liusiastiC Republican Alliance of Oakland
iÂ«.ft the mole to-night for Los Angeles in
its special train. A large crowd gathered
to see the stalwarts depart, and it was
even money as to whether the band or the
crowd made the most noise. It was a
glorious sendoff.
The train is a study of tariff and finance,
and it is almost a pity that its speed will
not be slow, so that he who runs may read.
Along the cars were stretched huge ban
ners bearing the words, "The Republican
Alliance of Oakland." These were caught
up with flags and bunting. On the bag
gaee-car and the rear end of the sleeper
large two-sheet l.hographs, mounted on
canvas, were fastened. These are of artistic
pictorial design and at the top a life-size
portrait of William McKinley rests be
tween crossed flags emblazoned with the
words :
.: WILLIAM rHcKIXIJET, \
â¢ The Advance Agent of :
: Prosperity. :
Beneath this picture are quotation!
from the great protectionist, ouch as:
"The Republican party stands for hon
est money and a chance to earn it."
"I believe that it is a good deal better to
open up the mills of the United States to
the laborers of America than to open up
the mints of the United States to the
silver of the world."
Below thio is a comparative table, &i,ow
ing the price of wheat under Republican
irotection as against Democratic free
trade, which is comprehensive.
On either side of the reading matter sym
bolical pictures of labor under protection,
showing the forge fires burning brightly,
tne mechanic, farmer and miner at work
and the factories in full blast, stand
out in striking relief to the pictured re
sults of Democratic misrule, where the
laborers are shown to be idle and hungry,
while a train wreck has killed the farmer
and ruined his business.
Below all this is a shield surmounted by
flags. Inside tne cars bunting, flags and
appropriate emblems are much in evidence
and certainly the display is calculated to
arouse the patricti?:a of the most dormant
nature. All the bertha weie taken and
141 people will be on the train, exclusive
of employes.
When Los Angeles is reached the train
will be met by a special committee com
posted of James Cuyner, R. A. Ling, J. T.
Martin, G. H. Stewart, E. T. Johnson, J.
S. Slausson, J. W. Hinton, C. E. Decamp,
S. C. Hubbell and others. Hazard's Pa
vilion in Los Angeles will be the scene of
to-morrow evening's exercises. It is the
largest hall in the city and though its
capacity is estimated at 6000 it is ex
pected that an overflow meeting will be
necessary.

It is the general opinion that a more

the Golden West Judge Henshaw, W. S.
Barnes, Judge Carpenter and Samuel M.
Shortridge and other detailed speakers

COLORED NAVAL OFFICERS.
A Prospect That Stirs Up the Department
and Creates Consternation at
Annapolis.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 28.-The
Navy Department is stirred up over the
prospect of having two colored naval of
ficers. It has just been learned that
among the young men wbo will present
themselves at the naval academy at An
napolis next week for physical examina
tion as to their fitness to enter the
academy are two very bright young col
ored men. One of them is from Califor
nia, while the other represents a Chicago
district. Nothing was known as to their
color or antecedents until a day or two
ago, because eacn of them received his ap
pointment from his respective Congress
man after having passed at the head of
the list in a competitive examination.
Several years ago a colored youth was
appointed as a cadet to Annapolis aud the
authorities of the academy compelled bis
white associates to treat him with every
courtesy. On one occasion a white cadet
from the South was ordered to fence with
the colored youth. He threw down his
ioil and indignantly refused to "cross
swords with a nigger." The white cadet
was promptly dismissed from the acad
emy. The colored cadet, whose name was
Conyers, was only of ordinary intelligence,
however, and at the examination in 1876,
when he was in his second year, he was
"thrown," and since that time no colored
boys have been at the academy.
The two candidates who will report next
week are not JikeJy, however, to fail at
any of the mental examinations which
they must undergo during their stay at the
academy, because of the remarkable in
telligence they displayed at the com
petitive examinations, where they fairly
won their appointments. If they are
graduated â as there is every probability
they will be, unless tney a~e found
physically deficient next weekâ the young
naval officers of four years hence are con
fronted with, the possibility of bunking
with colored roommates. The accommo
dations for the younger officers on tin.
new warships are circumscribed, and un
less the two colored cadets, when assignee
to tbeir naval stations, can be detaled to
the same ship, there is apt to be some in
teresting developments in the future be
fore the two colored cadets fly the ad
miral's pennant.
ALTGELD TO FORMAN.
Declares the Charges to Be Made
Up of False and Slan
derous Trash.
But the Dictator of the I linois Silver
Democrats Does Not Go
Into Details.
. SPRINGFIELD, 111., Aug. 28.âGover
nor Altgeld last night gave to the press his
answer to the open letter recently pub
lished by Hon. William S. Forman at
tacking his administration and charging
him with converting State money to his
own use. Among other things he says:
My attention has been called to the fact that
while I was away from home you emerged
from the brush and made some insinuations
against me, and also made an attack upon two
dead men. While your entire article is made
up of malicious, false and Blanderous trash
that has been repeatedly published in partisan
newspapers, and while all of it that any liv
ing man may know anything about has by
them been branded false and malicious and
does not call for any further notice, it is
urged by prominent Democrats that as you
are trying to pose before the people of this
State you should be asked to step out of the
shadow into the sunlight and experience a
new sensation.
Why did you write that letter at this time?
Everything in it was old and you simply re
hashed a slander. Every insinuation and
allegation you made is false, and if yon knew
anything about the facts, then you knew you
were making false insinuations. If you knew
nothing about the facts, that is, simply al
lowed your political disappointments to lead
you into this step, then you did a thing that
was cowardly.
The Governor goes on to show that
Forman had been turned down by his
neighbors in town and county conven
tions and that he was sore against the ad
ministration because be believed them fo
be instrumental in his discomfiture. He
closed by saying :
If you want to destroy the party which once
honored you would it not be more manly to
get out in front and Join the Republicans
rather than to stab it while professing to still
love it? You say at the beginning of your let
ter that you suppose it makes no difference to
me what yon do in the coming election In re
gard to my candidacy. Here you are mistaken.
If I cannot look with respect on the commis
sion by virtue of which I exercise the functions
of office, then I do not want to hold it, and if I
cannot look honest men in the face then I do
not want to be Governor of Illinois, and there
fore repeat what I have said on a number of
previous occasions, that if my election de
pends on your vote then J do not want It
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 28.âEx-Con
gressman William S. Forman was seen in
his office in East St. Louis to-day and
asked what he had to say to the reply of
Governor John P. Altpeld* to the charges
that he made against him of using State
money without interest. "I prefer to
answer them by another letter, which I
will have ready for the press in a day or
two. Before I wrote the letter to Gov
ernor Altgeld I fully considered tbe
charges I made and was anxious for him
to answer them."

NIAGARA FALLS, N. V., Aug. 28.â
That wonderful voice of W. J. Bryan was
in bad condition for oratory this morning
at Tonawanda, twelve miles from Buffalo,
where he had the first opportunity of
using it. He spoke with an effort and
showed plainly the effect on his vocal
organs of the last few days of long
speeches. The Democratic candidate, Mrs.
Bryan and a party of Erie County sud
porters, left Buffalo shortly after 8 o'clock
on a special car of the Buffalo and Niagara
Falls Electric Railwny.
KXOWLE3VILLE, N. V., Aug. 28.â
Just before the train left Niagara Falls
Mrs. Bryan was handed an immense
bunch of chrysanthemums. On the way
to the next station, Medina, the chrysan
themums, one by one, were presented by
Mrs. Bryan to every one within her
reach, and when the train beld up at
Medina the lady stood with her husband
on the rear platform and there resumed
the work of distribution among a large
crowd of persons who had assembled near
the tracks.
Many ladies were in the crowd and
strove with the rest for the coveted flowers.
Mr. Bryan excused himself from speak
ing. He said he had to save his voice for
tne next station. Knowlesville.
Arriving at Knowlesville at 1:10 p.m.,
Mr. Bryan was received by a large gather
ing, Mr. and Mrs. Bryan took seats in a
carriage drawn by Bilver-gray horses and
were wheeled away to the home of Mr.
end Mrs. Eugene Woodford, where they
were entertained at lunch with Mrs. T.
Morey Hodgeman, a Lincoln neighbor of
tbe Bryans, and Mrs. Woodford's sister.
Mr Bryan then proceeded to Slawson's
Grove, wbere the Farmers' Alliance picnic
of Orleans County was in progress. Here
Mr. Bryan addressed a large audience.
He said :
This is a very unusual spectacle. I have met
immense audiences in the cities where a
great many people live in small territories,
but this is tne largest audience I have ever
seen assembled in the middle of an agricul
tural country. lam glad to notice here the
mothers and wives, us well as the sons and
husbands, because, my iriends, our cause is
the cause in which the whole family is inter
ested. [Applause.] I am glad that at this
meeting we are having as the presiding officer
a man who, until this year, voted the Re
publican ticket. lam glad, because some of
the newspapers parade before the public the
names of prominent Democrats who are
going to desert the ticket, and I am glad that
for every Democratic deserter we are to have
accessions from the Republican party more
than enough to make up the difference. [Ap
plause.] Politics is a practical question and it
is so simply because it can be comprehended
by our people. Neither my time nor my phys
ical strength will permit an extended discus
sion of the issues of the campaign. But I de
sire to suggest some thoughts which may help
you in your study of the issues and in your de
termination of the part which you should take.
Here Mr. Bryan read an extract from
Mr. Carlisle's speech of 1878 ana comment
ing on it said:
John G. Carlisle divided society into two
; classes. On the one side he put the idle
holders of idle capital; on the other he put
the struggling masses, who product) the
wealth and pay the taxes of the country. *. [Ap-
I plause.] If that ; division existed then it
exists to-day. More that that, John G. Carlisle
| said that a public officer sworn to do his duty
i would be controlled in his official conduct by
his sympathies, and if his sympathies were
with the idle holders of idle capital he would
coin as little money as possible, whereas if
his sympathies were with the struggling
masses he would coin as much as the law
would permit. [Applause.] I believe he spoke
the truth when he Raid that society was
divided into these two classes upon the ques
tion involving money. I believe he was right
when he said that if a man's sympathies were
with the struggling masses <he would favor a
larger amount of money than he would if his
sympathies were with the idle holders of idle
money. Â«
Mv friends, the issue to-day is between the
idle holders of idle money and the struggling
masses who produce the wealth and pay the
taxes of the country. â  [Applause.] And when
this is understood, when men find out about
the money question, you will find out if there
is a man in your community whose interests,
whose sympathies are with the idle holders of
idle money he will be in favor of a gold stand
ard, and not daring to say so he will talk
about "honest money" and a "sound dollar."
[Applause.] But if his sympathies are- with
those who produce the Nation's wealth he will
be for the gold and silver coinage of 'the con
stitution, no matter how- many times you may
call him an anarchist. They tell us that these
prominent financiers are â¢ going to leave the
Democratic party because it declares for the
restoration of silver. We shall . not go into
court to secure an order to prevent their go
ing. [Laughter.] The Democratic party has
been weighed down by those millstones long
enough. 1 am glad to get rid of those who want
to use the party organization for private gain
and their country for public plunder. [Ap
plause.]
Let me read a little from Mr. Carlisle's
speech. [A voice. "Why do you read from Mr.
Carlisle's speech?"] ; Why? Because no man
has presented: a more â¢ forcible - argument in
| favor of bimetallism than Mr. Carlisle has.
j [Goeat applause and cheering.] Let me read
; now what he has to say of the bill: - "But it
I will certainly offer some relief. , It will reverse
the grinding process that has been going on
for the last few years." -Away back, eighteen
years ago, he spoke of this as the grinding
process ; and, my friends, it does : not lighten
the effects of the grinding process to call it a
temporary embarrassment. [Applause.] *
Again quoting Mr. Carlisle, Mr. Bryan
continued as follows:
He understood the laws of finance. He un
derstood what would be the effect of adding
this /money to the circulation, and, my
mends, if he stated the truth then that truth
has not changed since then, nor can it be
changed, though every one. who spoke for it
has turned his back upon it. [Applause.]
Truth lives; it is the one thing that will not
die. > I quote these words to you to show that
by the increase of the volume of money we ex
pect to stop the v constant .appreciation of
money and the constant depreciation of prop
erty. There is a difference between: the own
ers of money and the owner or. producer of
property. Let me illustrate: - ; Suppose a man

twice as much. It mean s that it ; will -â  take

much to pay the taxes and twice as much to
pay tne debt; the roan rinds out tbat he Is not
able to pay that debt as he agreed to do. What
then? You say, extend the mortgage. Why,
they will tcli him that the land has gone down
in value now, and that the farm is not worth
enough to be good security lor the thousand
dollars.
Then what? There is one thing. He can
turn the farm over to the man who holds the
mortgage. That he can always do. What is the
result? He and his wife have lost $ 1000 they
had invested in the farm. They have lost the
labor they put forth in trying lo pay the mort
gage, and then they lose the farm and start
outin life again. How about the other man, who
sold him the farm and got the thousand dol
lars down? If he loaned that thousand dollars
he got security on his thousand and he has the
thousand within his reach, and then he gets
his farm back. I ask you i( there is any differ
ence between the holder of capital and the
owner of property in the appreciation of the
dollar. The man with the money is twice as
well off as he was before, and the. man who
tried to own property loses all he has and has
to begin again. You find the mea who hold
the notes meeting in convention anddeclarintr
that the gold standard is the best system of
money that was ever Invented. But will these
people who have lost their homes, will they
meet together and indorse the system that is
destroying them?
My friends, this is a practical question that
confronts the farmers of the United States and
not of the United States alone, but the farmers
of Ireland, the farmers of England and the
farmers of Germany and the farmers of every
nation in the world that have the gold siand
ard to-day. I assert that the gold standard
could not live lor one day in any nation under
the sun without the aid of money-owners and
the money-cnangers to keep it In existence. I
assert that the gold standard has never re
ceived the indorsement of any ciass of people
except those who prosper most as society is
destroyed by arising dollar.
Now, I want to say to you that my denuncia
tion of the gold standard is sustained by even
this which you can see. Let me give you a
proof. If a man.tells you the gold standard is
a good thing, you ask him why it is that no
party in the history of the United States has
ever declared for a gold standard in its plat
form.
Isn't it strange if the gold standard is a good
thing that no party has ever seen fit to say so
in a platform? And yet that is true. Itistrue
no National party has ever indorsed a gold
standard, and yet there are people who favor
it. Why don't they have tne courage to write
a platiorm and risk an issue before the people?
But no, they don't do that. They gu to St.
Louisand write and adopt a platform which
says the Republican party pledges itself to
bimetallism, which of course Is a denunciation
of the gold standard. (Laughter and applause.]
If the gold standard is good why should we
try to get rid of it, my friends? [Applause.]
If tho gold standard is good, why did the Re
publican party pledge itself to help keep a
gold standard; but no, it pledged itself to get
rid of the gold standard just as soon as other
nations will help us. [Laughterand applause.]
That is not my language, my friends.
That is the language oi the Republican plat
form and that is the construction placed upon
it by the candidate wlio runs upon in its ac
ceptance. He says in his letter that the Ameri
can people cannot enter upon bimetallism
without the concurrent action of other na
tions. Does he say we shall maintain a gold
standard for one year? No. For four years?
No. But the conclusion Is that we must main
tain it forever if other nations say we must.
[Applause.] It is not a question of politics, my
iriends. Whole parties are divided on this
issue. It rises above the question of politics.
They have declared" against the right of the
people of the United States to govern them
selves. They have declared that while we
want to get rid of the gold standard we must
keep the thing which we don't want until
aliens shall bring us the relief which we should
achieve for ourseli. [Applause.] In my humble
judgment the American people are the only
people who have a right to say what the
American people need in legislation.
They have driven down the price of your
products; they have increased the burden of
your debts; they have foreclosed your mort
gages; they are degrading and lowering the
standard of civilization by driving people who
whuv to work out upon the streets, and then
idleness breeds crime and crime menaces the
safety of every citizen of the land. [Applause.
A voice, "How about free trade ?''J It is not
more taxes tne people want, but more money
to pay taxes with. [Applause.] If there is any
farmer here who has not taxes enousn to pay,
I beg him to go to his county treasurer and
pay enough to satisfy his conscience and not
try to tax all the rest of the people. [Ap
plause.]
The subject of taxation is ever present with
us. We can change our tariffsystem any time,
but we have reached our crisis in monetary
affairs and we have got to decide whether the
American people will run our finances or turn
our Government over to syndicates to take care
of for us.
This question is of much importance to those
who are seeking to raise the value of gold oy
legislation, and should it not be important to
those who lor twenty years have suffered from
this financial legislation? I met a farmer
over in Illinois. He was a schoolmate of mine
in college, a graduate from college. He is a
man of exemplary habits, honest, frugal and
industrious. He had his throe children wiih
him in the room and the tears rolled down his
cheeks as he told me that if conditions re
mained as they were it was the saddest thing
he had to contemplate that he could not give
to those children the educaiion and advantages
he wanted to. That home is multiplied by
thousands and tens of thousands in this laud,
and you tell me that it is just to have a system
of legislation that takes away from the parent
the possibility of educating his chidren as
he would, and is compensated for it by giving
money undeserved into the hands those who
by machination corner the money market and
spend the money by buying foreign titles for
their daughters. [Long and continued ap
plause.]
My friends, civilization is wrapped up in
the solution of the money question. It is the
main question involved in this campaign. The
right of self-government and the existence of
republican institutions is involved in it. If
foreign nations can force a financial policy
upon the American Nation they will want to
enforce their system of governmentâ a sy:-t*-m
which. brings distress to the people, a system
which is a monarchical 6ystem and which
maintains itself by standing armies. Even
now, my friends, when we speak out against
unjust legislation they say we are disturbers
of the public peace and a menace to law and
order. Do you mean to say that the farmers
gathered here and the laborers who are con
gregated in our cities are enemies to our coun
try? No. They have earned the epithets of
our opponents, not because they menace law
and order, not because they are going to in
augurate injustice, but because they say
"Thou shalt not steal" shall apply to the great
corporations as well 8s to the highwayman
and burglar.
It is because they declare that this Govern
ment was not instituted in order that its in
strumentalities should be monopolized by
those who use the Government ior their own
ends and put it in distress. [Applause.]
But I cannot talk longer. [Cries of "Go on,
go on."] No, I have to go back to speak at
another town to-night. 1 would like to talk to
an audience like this until I could say many
more things which, to my judgment, are
worthy of your consideration, but I shall have
done all I hope to do now if I could impress
upon you the importance of studying this
money question, as it relates to you. If some
body cries "Fire" and you don't know where
the fire is, you may seem little concerned; but
if a man tells you your house is on fire, you
become interested. The promulgation of the
gold standardiÃ an attack upon your homes
and your firesides and you have as much right
to resist it as to resist an army marching to
take your children captive and burn the roof
over your head. [Applause.]
I have simply told you what I believe. I
speak the sentiments that lie deep down in my
heart. I used to be indifferent to the money
question, and until six years ago I thought
anybody was a crank who talked about money
but when I got to study the money question I
found that it overshadowed ail other queÃ
w^i 81 it ,, WHS deeper and greater and
higher than all other questions we had to
deal with, and when I read in the address of
Mr. Carlisle that the consummation of this
scheme meant more misery to the humau race
than our worst pestilence that ever oc
curred in the history of the world, I
began to realize the importance of the
money question. I believe Mr. Carlis'e
spoke the truth, and it is because I be
lieve that the gold standard hns made more
misery fci- the human race than wars and pes
tilence and famines, more misery than human
mind can conceive or human mind can tellâ
it is because I believe that prophecy, that Is
ever since I became convinced of it, that I
have cried out against tbe conspiracy, and I
shall cry out against it as long as God gives me
tie voice to speak. [Applause aad cneers.]
TO ASSIST THE DEMOCRATS.
Jones Appoints an Advisory Committee
of Silver Advocates .
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 28.â Senator
Jones this evening appointed the advisory
committee among the silver advocates and
organizations outside The Democratic
party to act as advisers to the Democratic
National campaign committee in its man
agement of the cam paign. The following
have been asked to serve as members of
this committee: Senators Henry M. Teller
of Colorado and Fred T. Duuois of Idaho,
representing the Silver Republicans; Sen
ator Marion Butler of North Carolina,
chairman of the National Populist Com
mittee, and C. T. Washburn of Massa
chusetts, representing the People's party ;
I. N. Stevens of Colorado, chairman of the
National Silver party committee, and
George P. Keeney of California, chief or
ganizer of the Silver party, as representa
tives of that organization.
Senator Jones said these appointments
were "for the purpose ot prompt unity
and entire harmony among theee various
political organizations in the management
of the campaign." The members will be
frequently at Democratic headquarters in
this city and will aid the Democratic cam
paign committee with their counsel on all
questions
Mr. Stevens, one of these official cam
paign advisers, has been in Chicago a few
days, and left to-night for his home in
Denver. He will return September 1 and
formally open headquarters of the Silver
party at the Clifton House or the Audi
torium Hotel.
Senator Jones received the following
telegram to-day from Lincoln, Nebr., the
author being Known to Secretary Walsh
as a prominent citizen: "Large hanging
picture of Mr. Bryan burned on Eleventh
street last night by persons marching in
Republican rally. We have positive
proof."
Commenting on this alleged act Chair
man Jones said: "They have charged us
with being incendiaries, but they have not
charged us with burning anything that I
know of."
Mr. Walsh has received a voluminous
and detailed report of the situation in
lowa from Chief Wells of the State Liter
ary Bureau and Chief O'Meara of the
speakers' bureau. The figures from the
county committees, clubs and editors give
a much greater gain of Republican voters
than losses from gold Democrats; the or
ganization of big Bryan clubs in former
Republican strongholds and an estimated
Democratic gain of 33% per cent in the
State at large.
A MOST EXCITING CAUCUS.
Ex- Governor Waller Howled Down 6y
Former Constituents.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Aug. 28.â The
most exciting caucus ever held in this
city was conducted at the courthouse to
night, where delegates to State, Sena
torial, Congressional and probate conven
tions were chosen. It was a babble of con
fusion, fierce animosity being shown from
start lo finish. Ex -Governor Waller, who
led the opposition to the silver advocates
of the Democratic party, was hissed down
and literally driven from the building.
He was never so humiliated before on
his own stamping ground, where he had
been the guiding hand of the party for a
generation. He declared the caucus ille
gally called, illegally held and refused to
abide by its decision.
Waller began the contest at the very
opening of the meeting, but the caucus
was against him and would not give him
a respectful hearing. Mr. Waller said suf
ficient notice of the caucus had not been
given. He was thereupon called a "gold
bug," "traitor" and a "rat."
He fought the organizing forces from the
time the meeting was calied to ordÂ«r until
after Chairman Jonn C. Geary was in
structed to appoint a committea to name
delegates. He was beaten and left ibe
hall, going outside where he spoke from
a coach bareheaded in the open air to
probably 2000 people. Ho riddled the sil
ver candidates and platform, censured
those who had howled him down and de
clared his purpose to take the stomp in
his own city and throughout the State
against the ticket.
ELLIOTT ASKED TO RESIGN,
Wheelmen Make Objection to His Views
on Sound Money.
BOSTON, Mass., Aug. 28.â Sterling El
liott, president of the League of American
Wheelmen, has been asked to resign be
cause of his sound-money views recently
expressed in the L. A. W. Bulletin. The
demand comes from the members of the
Utah Division, L. A. W., the officers of
which have mailed a circular to every
chief consul, secretary and treasurer in the
country, which says:
"We earnestly request that you will be
instrumental in getting your division to
take such action as will prevent a possible
disruption of our league by making of It a
political organization, with the avowed
intention, as expressed by Sterling El
liott, of upholding certain financial
views."
The Utah cyclists have been backed up
by members in Colorado, Minnesota and
other Western States. Mr. Elliott said:
"I presented a single article on one side
of the question, and the column 3of the
Bulletin are free to those who wish to re
fute it. The question whether that paper
may properly aiscuss the leading topics
of the day is hardly debatable, although I
do not intend to follow the subject up in
any offensive fashion. Of course I have
absolutely no authority to represent any
one besides myself in this matter and no
importance should be attached to what I
say beyond what might properly belong to
the opinion of the individual."
The Indianapolis Convention.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ikd., Aug. 28.â The
advance guard for the National Demo
cratic Convention, in the persons of the
newspaper correspondents, has begun to
arrive, but no arrivals of delegates are
looked for until Sunday evening. The de
mand for quarters at the hotels and for
tickets to the convention continue to grow,
and it seems now certain that the conven
tion will attract at least 10,000 and pos
sibly 15,000 visitors.

DEATH OF HARRY HILL.
At One Time a Wealthy Sport, but Dies
in I'oreriy.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 28.-Harry
Hill, the veteran sporting man, one of the
best known New Yorkers of his time and
well known throughout the country, died
at his home in Corona, Long Island, at 9
o'clock last evening.
Harry Hill had the reputation, of which
he was proud, of being "the sqnarest
man" who ever owned a sporting resort in
New York. A decade and a half ago his
report at Houston and Crosby streets was
Known all over the country.
Hill, who was at one time reputed to be
worth $500,000, died in poverty. In the
height of his prosperity the police drove
Harry Hill out of his place, arid his finan
cial downfall began at that time. He was
one of those who backed Billy Edwards in
his fight with Sam Colyer at Cone River,
Virginia, and he was stakeholder when in
1870 Jem Mace signed articles for a fight
with Joe Coburn. Fully $25,000 in stakes
wns deposited with Hill when Sullivan de
feated Ryan at Mississippi City.

AWFUL TRAGEDY
AT KANSAS CITY.
A Mother Kills Her Three
Little Children and
Herself.
DEAD FOR SEVERAL DAYS
Strange Stillness About the House
Leajds to the Horrible
Discovery.
HUSBAND AND FATHER AWAY.
Evidence That the Mother Committed
the Terrible Deed at Night
While Tnsane.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 28.-This
community was horrified to-day by the
discovery of a dreadful tragedy in what
had always been regarded as one of the
happiest families in this city.
For Beveral days people living in the
vicinity of tbe residence of Charles W.
Green, traveling passenger agent of the
Big Fonr Railway, had noticed that there
was no appearance of life about the nouse,
but that fact caused little surprise. Fi-
ally, however, in some way an investi-
gation came to be made to-day and a hor
rible tragedy was discovered. It was
found that every member of the family
except Mr. Green lay dead in the house.
The bodies were already beginning to
show signs of decomposition, showing
tbat death must have occurred some con
siderable time before. Neighbors remem
bered that about 2 o'clock Wednesday
morning pistol shots had been heard, and
it is now believed that the deadly work
took place at that time.
The body of Mrs. Green lay on the floor
in the doorway of the bedroom with a
ghastly wound in the head. The bodies
of tbe three little children were all in bed.
Mrs. Green was fully dressed and near
her hand lay the revolver with which the
work had been done.
All the appearances indicate that Mrs.
Green committea the deed. She evidently
put her three children to bed and then re
mained up waitine for the time to kill
them. She must have waited until 2
o'clock, the time that the shots were
heard. Then she stole into the bedroom
and shot them as they lay asleep, ending
the tragedy with her own death.
The only possible explanation of the af
fair is that Mrs. Green must have been
crazy. Her home life was a peculiarly
happy one. The bereaved husband and
father went to Salt Lake on a business
trip a week aso and is now on his way
home. The three children who were
killed were a boy of 13, a girl of 9 and a
girl of 61
SHE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
On His Way Botne Oblivious to His
Great Bereavement.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 28.â C. W. Green,
traveling passenger agent of the Big Four,
has been in Colorado for some time and
spent last night in Denver. When he left
for his desolated home this afternoon he
had not yet been apprised of the dreadful
tragedy.
A telegram reached the Rio Grande and
Midland oftices here this morning, con
taining the news of the finding of the
bodies of the dead mother and her three
children. Jfas3enger Agent Bailey of tLo
Midland and Assistant Passenger Agent
Swan of the Rio Grande at once hunted up
Mr. Green.
This afternoon at 1 o'clock they saw him
aboard a Union Pacific train for Kansas
City, not having told him, however, the
horrible news of his affliction. Several
times while in Denver Mr. Green spoke of
his family, and said that he was surprised
at not hearing oftener from them. These
complaints have been more frequent within
the past few days.
RAILROAD TIED UP.
'he American Manager in Conflict With
the Colombian Authorities.
PANAMA, Colombia, Aug. 28.â The
Star and Herald says: The inhabitants of
the city of Carthaeena are greatly excited
over differences which have arisen in re
gard to the contract of the Carthagena
and Magdalena River Railroad, which is
American property, constructed by Boston
capitalists and costing $5,000,000. Senor
Gerling, Governor of the province, has or
dered Manager Ford of the railroad to re
ceive and transport freight by weight,
threatening to fine and imprison him
should be fail to comply with the order.
Manager Ford made his reply on August
24, refusing to obey the order, and it is
possible that he is under arrest at the
present moment, and the railroad shut
down. The Governor may seize and un
dertake the management of the road, as
by the manager's arrest the road would
have to suspend all operations, since there
would be no legal representative nor any
body else to look after the property.
Two thousand tons of freight are now
awaiting transportation, and more is ar
riving daily. The damages resulting
from the suspension of the operation of
the road will be very heavy.
A FANAMA SENSATION.
Capture of n Box Containing $600,000
Worth of Forged A'otes.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 28. âThe
Herald's special cable from Panama says:
Yesterday a sensation was caused here by
the seizure of a box containing $600,000
worth of forged notes on the National
Bank of Colombia. The money is mainly
in $50 bills.
The person in whose possession the box
was when seized was Hernando Villa, a
prominent and wealthy Colombian. He
has been arrested, and is now in jail in
Ambalema.
It is thought that this id only a portion
ot the forged notes. Sensational disclo
sures implicating many others hieb in
social and political life are expected to
follow soon.

CURIOUS CRIMINAL CASE
A Counterfeiter So Affected by a
Religious Revival That
He Confesses.
As a Result Hi and Hs Accomplices
Are in Jail and Their Tools
Are Capture:!.
WACO, Tex., Aug. 28.â One of the most
curious cases in the criminal history of
Texas has just come to light The Fed
eral authorities have discovered a gigantic
system of manufacturing counterfeit coin
in imitation of silver dollars of United
States mintage, and have captured several
equipments and three prisoners.
The discovery was the result af a relig
ious revival tbat has been in progress for
some time in this part of the State.
Among those attracted to one of these
meetings in this city was Edward Daniel
Enms. He became so affected that he
finally arose and said that he had a con
fession which he felt he must make.
He said that he had been a theological
student, but bad fallen into bad ways and
was now engaged in counterfeiting. He
told where the crucibles, base metals,
molds and rollers for milling tbe bogus
dollars were to be found.
The deputy Marshals captured the
equipment and arrested two other men â
John Mitchell and H. S. Hanner. Yester
day Ennis, Mitchell and Hanner were
arraigned before United States Commis
sioner Finks. In default of bail they went
to jail.
The bogus dollars are made of one part
of silver ana four parts of alloy. In his
confession Ennis, who is an educated man,
said that tne counterfeiting syndicate was
called the Royal Manufacturing Company
and bad plants at El Paso, Birmingham,
Ala., and other places. It appears that
the bogus dollars were sent to Mexico and
exchanged for genuine Mexican silver.
WAR IN INDIAN TERRITORY.
Squaw-Men and Full-Blood Setninolet in
J>nadlti Strife.
WICHITA, E.AN3., Aug. 28. -There is
serious trouble between the squaw-men
and full- bloods of the Seminole nation in
the Indian Territory, and troops from the
First Cavalry reached the scene to-day
barely in time to avert a general fight.
Tbe full-bloods and squaw-men had a
desperate battle yesterday, in which three
full-blonds were killed and several squaw
men seriously injured. The trouble broke
out at the little village of Wewoka, where
about 200 squaw-men made an attack on|a
much larger number of full- bloods, and
tne latter fled panic-stricken through the
streets. The full-bloods are in control of
the counci!, the law-making of the Semi
noles, and becoming alarmed at the en
croachments of whites who have inter
married, thus acquiring valuable property
rights and gohbUng up the best tracts of
land, they passed a law a few weeks ajjo
expelling all white men from the nation.
The whites resisted, and there has been
continuous turmoil. The Indian police
were ordered to clear the country of
wbites, but tbeir efforts have been inef
fectual. The militia may quell the dis
turbance, but the squaw-men will make a
stubborn fight for their homes.

IN DANGER OF BEING LYNCHED.
Three Masked Robbers Held on a Charge
of Committing a Cruel Crime
in lowa.
OTTUMWA, lowa, Aug. 28.â Miss Nel
lie Warner, 20 years of age, is lying at the
point of death at Libertyville, lowa, tbe
victim of an assault committed yesterday
by three masked men, and in the County
Jail are confined three yonng men cnarged
with the crime. They are being carefully
guarded to prevent lynching, which seems
most likely. The victim was alone at the
home of her parents, when three masked
men entered and committed an assault
after binding and Ragging tbe girl. They
then ransacked the house and carried
away all the valuables they could find.
The young woman freed herself, and
crawling to a neighbor's told the story
and gave a description of the assailants.
Posses were sent out and in tbe evening
three men were arrested at Bladensburg.
They were jailed at Fairfield until to-day,
when they were taken before the girl.
After she gave the alarm she fainted and
revived only at times. It was when she
was half conscious that she looked at the
men brought before her, and she failed to
identify them. They were rejailed to
await developments. The men fit the
description given and also tbat ol three
men who were seen to drive to the Warner
home in tbe morning. The citizens of
Jefferson County are excited and lynch
ing is looked for to-night.

SHOET BUT TELLING SPEECHES
MADE AT CANTON,
The United States, Says the Standard-
Bearer, Wi 1 Not Change Its
Sound Financial Po icy.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 28.â Major Mc-
Kinley made tyro speeches to-day, and
they were both short. His first visitors
were a committee representing the exec
utive committee of the National Repub
lican League. They came fresh from the
enthusiastic meeting at Milwaukee. The
members of the sub-committee and their
residences follow: Colonel George Stone,
California; B. G. Dawes, Nebraska; John
Goodnoe, Minnesota; O. S. Glicb, Wis
consin; T. L. Edinborougb, Michigan;
Luke F. Walker, Wisconsin; T. T. Meier,
New Jersey; W. F. Poucher, New Jersey;
George W. Such, Pennsylvania; Frank J.
Higgins, New Jersey; L. J. Dowimg, Mis
souri; Congressman Howell, New Jersey;
Congressman McEwans, New Jersey; T.
F. Barrett, West Virginia. B. L. McElroy
of Mount Vernon and Charles Leach,
president of the Ohio State Republican
League were also with the committee.
The committee gathered in Major Mc-
Kiniey's library, and after they had
been presented to him John Goodnoe
of Minnesota, the spokesman, assured
Mr. McKinley of the loyalty and
support of the league's members, num
bering over 2,000,000 voters. It had
been the method of the league clubs'
the speaker said, to present Republican
doctrines to yonne men about to cast their
first vote and to new voters at the time
when they nave leisure to study dispas
sionately. It has ever been only for the
success q\ the party and its principles and
has never attempted to interfere with
nominations and appointments.
"In that sense," he continued, "we are
not 'practical politicians.' The league is
formed on the fact that it is the duty of
every citizen to study public questions,
and having so studied them it is his privi
lege to assure, in the most effective way at
bis command, the practical success of the
policies and principles he deems best for
the good of the whole country. Our motto
is, 'Educate and organize.' It has been
the method of the clubs to study and dis
cuss public questions between campaigns,
to present Republican doctrines to young
men aDout to cast their first vote and to
new voters at the time when they have
leisure to study dispassionately."
In response Major McKinley made one
of the most impressive little speeches to
which he has given utterance this cam
paign. He said :
Mr. Goodnoe and Gentlemen : It gi res me great
pleasure to greet at my home this large com
mittee representing the Republican clubs of
the United States. I know something of your
worth and work. I know how in former cam
paigns the splendid services of the young Re
publicans of the country have contributed to
bring to us most signal triumphs. I am glad
to hear from your spokesman, fresh from your
National convention, that the- Republican
party and the Republican cause this year are
to have your united, aggiessive and unfalter
ing support, and I am sure with that support,
connected with the support which will come
from all classes of your fellow-citizens every
where, will give to the National ticket and to
our party a triumph the like of which we
never have had for many, many years. [Ap
plause.]
Gentlemen, you never had a worthier cause
to strive for than you have this year. The
financial honor of the country and the pros
perity of all its people are enough to inspire
every American heart to the best possible
effort. [Applause.] I have seen somewhere an
inquiry: "Cannot the United States establish
a financial system of its own; is it too weak
and defident to do that?" I answer: -The
United frmtes now has a financial policy which
in the main it has been pursuing since the be
ginning of the Government, and which it does
not mean to change until it can find a better
one." Those who make the inquiry are usually
against our American policy of finance, and
they are insisting that we shall adopt the
financial policy of China and Mexico. I hope
it will not be thought an evidence of lack of
National spirit or National iDdependence that
we decline to adopt their proposition. [Ap
plause.] I thank you for this call and for the
message of goodwill and greeting which you
bring to me from your great National body.
[Applause.]
At 4 o'clock a large delegation of United
Brethren clergymen who are attending a
conference here called on Major McKinley.
Bishop J. H. Mills of Oregon spoke in be
half of the ministers and Major McKinley
in response said :
Bisbop Mills, ladies ana gentlemen of the
East Ohio Conference of the United Brethren
church: It gives me sincere pleasure to re
spond to this call of greeting ana congratnla
tion. I duly the message of good
will which you so kindly bring from the re
ligious body which you represent It is a good
omen when religious teachers are alive to the
questions affecting the public welfare. Notn
ing is more worthy of your study and consid
eration than those questions which tend to
make the country great, prosperous and right
eous. Civic virtue is a good thing for the
preacher always, but a better thing for every
citizen to guard in his daily life. Good citi
zenship lies at the foundation of our true
greatness as a free government Those who
proclaim it are indeed Christian teachers and
public benefactors.
Tlie better the citizen the better a free gov
ernment and its laws. It is a gratifying fact,
as you stated, that in our form of government
character counts for so much. The lack of it
amounts to almost disqualification for public
trust. Whatever men's individual opinions
on moral questions are or may be, what good or
bid, whatever may be their party affiliations,
all prefer that public officials rhall be of high
character and worth. They may be heedless
of virture and careless of their own lives, but
they insist that those who are to execute the
public will fchall be men of unquestioned in
tegrity. Public opinion demands this and
happily all political parties respect it. I wish
for every religious body and every other body
whose object is to elevate mankind, the fullest
measure of success. No nobler cause could en
gage your faculties. I trust that your annual
conference here will be productive of good,
and that your stay here will bring pleasure to
you, as I am sure it has brought pleasure to
our people and to our city. I will be glad to
meet and greet each one of you who have hon
ored me to-day, and I thank you over and
over again for the courtesy and compliment
of this call. [Great applause.]
Major McKinley received even more
messages of a congratulatory character
concerning his letter of acceptance to-day
than yesterday.
Among the several hundred received to
day and this evening were the following:
COLUMBUS, Ohioâ Have been out of the
city, so could not communicate with you
sooner. Permit me now to offer my hearty
congratulations on your magnificent letter of
acceptance. Asa S. Bcshnell.
LEXINGTON, Ky.â Your beautiful recogni
tion of the obliteration of sectional lines
struck a responsive chord in the South. The
letter was perfect S. J. Roberts.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.â Your letter has con
verted thousands of Democrats in California.

Break of the Montana Boycott Against
McKinley Republicans.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 28.â Ex-Senator
W. F. Sanders of Montana, who is in
charge of the distribution of Republican
literature in that State for the National
Committee, in a letter received to-day by
Chief Perry Heath, states that tbe Repub
licans will hold a State convention Sep
tember 9 and organize a State Committee
beyond doubt for "sound money, protec
tion, McKinley and Hobart."
The ex-Senator adds: "Upon the whole
the outlook in Montana is encouraging.
The struggle for the next two weeks will
be for control of the State convention.
There is a law governing primaries, which
if enforced will enable the true Republi
cans to control the convention. Confiden
tial friends oi Senator Carter assert that
he will make a speech September 9 declar
ing his support of McKinley. The boycott
of McKinley Republicans into which
Democrats and Populists entered a month
ago has been broken down and proved a
boomerang."
Governor Hastings has been assigned to
speak in Detroit September 3 ana Senator
Thurston in Elgin, 111., September 16.

CHICAGO, 111.. Aug. 28.â A special
train of seven Pullman sleepers left
Chicago to-night over the Pennsylvania
for Canton bearing not quite 300 commer
cial travelers and their wives and a few
other Republicans who joined for the oc
casion. The trip to see and hear Major
McKinley is under the direction of the
National committee of the Commercial
Travelers' McKinley Club. Most of the
party was composed of members of Com
mercial McKinley Club 1 of Chicaco.
George J. Corey, the president, will make
the speech of presentation. Similar dele
gations are expected to come from Cleve
land. Detroit, Cincinnati, Indianapolis
and Grand Rapids and meet in Canton to

and visit to the major 2000 strong.
UNCLE SAM'S GUEST.
[Continued from First Page.\
pany of the naval reserves formed a cor
don. Here eight carriages were in waiting
for the foreigners. There was a delay of
half an hour in getting away. In the
meantime an Immense crowd had gath
ered outside the American line dock at
the foot of Fulton street. A large force of
police was on hand and they had all they
could do to r%strain the throng.
A detachment of the Sixth Cavalry,
U. S. A., was in waiting to escort the
envoy and his suite to the Hotel Waldorf.
A start was made at 2 f. x.
About 100 leading Chinese merchants
were in attendance. Their faces, usually
expressionless, fairiy beamed with joy at
the prospect of welcoming their great
countryman. In the first carriage was Li
Hung Chan;:, his secretary and interpreter,
General Ruger and Mr. Rockhill, Assistant
Secretary of State. The rest of the suite
followed in other carriages. As soon as
Li's carriage came off the pier into West
street half the cavalry detachment fell in
and preceded the procession. The other
half joined in behind the last carriage,
and in this order the march to the Waldorf
Hotel was begun. All along the route the
large crowds had gathered. The name of
Li Hung Chang was upon every one's lips,
and be received a great ovation, probably
the like of which was never tendered a
foreigner in this country. The streets
were jammed all the way with a cheering
multitude.
The procession np Broadway from the
Battery to the Waldorf was uninterrupted
by an unusual incident until Nineteenth
street and Fifth avenue was reached.
There a little ragamuffin threw a dried
lemon peel at the Embassador's carriage.
It made a curve in the air and General
Ruger and Li had to dodge so as not to be
hit by it. There was an immense croard
at Thirty-third street and Fifth avenue,
but Li entered the hotel quietly. The
cavalry lined up on the south side of
Thirty-third street, saluting him as he
passed in.
As Li Hung Chang was about to enter
the Waldorf he saw standing on the st ep
the Hon. John W. Foster, ex-Secretary of
State. They shook hands cordially. Mr.
Foster, it will De remembered, acted as
adviser to the famous statesman during
the negotiations for peace between China
and Japan in the late war.
The Viceroy did not register. Accom
panied by Mr. Foster, Mr. Rockhill, As
sistant Secretary 41 State, and General
Ruger, he ascended to his apartments,
which embrace the entire first floor. The
sleeping apartments are on the corner of
Fifth avenue and Thirty-third street. The
distinguished Chinaman was left alone
for a few minutes.
At 4 o'clock he gave audience in the hall
to the 100 or more silken robed Chinese
merchants of New Yoric.

WOODLAND, Cal., Aug. 28.â The trot
for the 2:24 class to-day was considered a
gift to Laurel, and she was barred in the
pool-selling. For second place the field
sold for $10, Alias for %1 and Winchester
for $5. The horses were sent away to an
even start on the third attempt. Laurel
at once assumed the lead and was never
headed. The fight for second place was
between Twilight and Auditor. Near the
three-quarter pole Twilight broke and lost
all chance for the place. Laurel was not
even crowded, and passed under the wire
in 2:l6}^. Letter B and Lena Hawley
were distanced.
The fight for place was again between
Auditor and Twilight in the second. As
before, a disastrous break decided the re
sult. On the homestretch Auditor broke
and fell back to seventh place, Twilight
taking second place.
In the third heat there was a fight
between Winchester and Alias for second
place, and the former won.
Following the trotting race, the cele
brated trotting dog Blucher was brought
on the track and speeded a quarter. He
was paced by a running horse and
made the quarter in one minute. The
dog was bitched i-> a pneumatic sulky,
and his driver weighed 100 pounds.
His performance was considered little less
than marvelous. The crowd made up a
generous purse for the boy owner of the
doe.
The five fnrlong running race, in which
there were five starters, proved to be a
surprise to the talent and tne short enders
had an inning. In the pools Reddington
sold favorite for $15 to Sea Spray $6 and
the field $5. Leon L and Sea Spray were
scratched. The. horses were sent away
without much difficulty and ran well
bunched until the homestretch was
reached. There Ricardo was let out a link
aud challenged the leaders. It was a close
finish, but Ricardo won from Howard by a
half length. The favorite was close up.
There was considerable betting on the tour
and a half furlong dash for two-year-olds
and Lost tiirl was installed as favorite at
$10 to $5 for Seven Up and $5 for the field.
The horses eot away the first trial. Gran
dezia took a slight lead and was never
headed. The others ran well bunched to
head of the stretch. Lost Girl made ber
run down the homestretch, but could not
overhaul the leader. Grandezia won and
the best the favorite could do was to get
place.

championship season to-day, and the former
won an interesting game by a score of 8 to 6.
Pond was in fine fettle and kept the hits of the
ylsitors scattered, but the team behind him
bunched their misplays in the second and
ninth innings and gave the Obioans five of
their runs. Johnny Foreman was batted hard
and was unsteady. Tne fielding of the visitors
was sharp. Attendance 4275. Score: Balti

BROOKLYN, N. V., Aug. 28.â Hill out

land this afternoon in the closest played game
of the series. Gumoert started to pitcn for
Philadelphia, but strained his back and re
tired at the end of the second inning in favor
of Keener. The latter lasted until the sixth,
when, base hits became too frequent and he
gave way lo Ortb, who held Cleveland down
in good style. Cuppy got such a drubbing in
the third inning that Tebeau substituted Gear

boys. Hughey, who took Killen's place in the
fourth, was an enigma to the Washington*.

OREGON FOREST FIRES,
A Fish Lake Camping Party's
Fight for Life With the
Flames,
Women Imperil Their Lives to Pre
vent the Destruction of a
Bridge.
SALEM, Ok., Ang. 28.â L. S. Winters of
this city, his daughter, Miss Minnie, bis
three sons, May Stabley of Mehama and a
Mr. Spalding, who have been camping in
the uplands near Fish Lake for the past
ten days, broke camp on Wednesday last
and started for Salem. On reaching what
is known as the Seven-mile Hill the forest
was found to be a mass of roarinp flames,
thousands of acres in extent. The road
runnine through the woods at this point
was impassable, though some teams just
ahead of Mr. Winters succeeded in get
ting through the fire belt by dint of hard
running, all the persons on the wagons
being badly scorched about the hands and
face and the dorses burned so badly that
some had to be killed.
Seven teams congregated on the hill
where the Winners party was halted and
the men and women worked desperately
and successfully to save a bridge ahead of
them. Before finishing the fight against
thÂ« fire the women's overdresses were
burned off and they were almost dead
from exhaustion.
After this delay the whole party pro
ceeded over hot coals and embers and
through dense and suffocating smoke to
ward their several destinations. The
ladies involved in the adventure were
badly freightened during the conflict with
the fiery element, but this wore off when
they were once more started on the home
ward trip.
The track of the fire trended north and
east toward Clear Lake, and Mr. Winters
says he never saw a forest fire of such in
tensity and rapidity of motion as this one.
RACING NEAR OAK POINT.
Million* of feet of Timber Destroyed by
a Conflagration.
ABTORIA, Ob., Aug. 28.â One of the
most extensive forest fires that ever raged
in this State is dealing destruction near
Oak Point, forty miles up the Columbia
River. With a wall of tlames three miles
wide it is sweeping 'through one of the
most valuable timber districts in Oregon.
Several camps have been destroyed and
many cattle have perished. So far no
human lives have been lost, though many
narrow escapes are reported. It is impos
sible to estimate the loss, as there is no
present prospect of the hre abating. Mil
lions of feet of timber have already been
destroyed. Several hundred men have
been tignting the fire all day without
making any headway against it."

Seldom has a preliminary examination

in Los Angeles taken such a hold upon the
DR. ANDREW S. SHORB of Los Angeles, Held for the Murder
of Mrs. Jennie Snyder, Late of Seattle, Wash.
public mind as that which ended to-day,
when Dr. Andrew S. Shorb was held in the
Superior Court on a charge of murdering
Jeunie R. Snyder, late of Seattle, Wash.
Mrs. Snyder, who had deserted her hus
band and was living under an assumed
name with a scapegoat named Relland,
died several weeks ago in East Los Angeles
as the result of a criminal operation. The
jury holding tbe inquest attributed the
death to Dr. Shorb, who had been called
in by Relland, who, soon after her death,
committed suicide. Shorb's preliminary
examination had been continued three or
four times. Senator White was his law
yer.
The accused is an old and wealthy
physician. Justice Owens' decision hold
ing him for murder produced a sensation
throughout the city.
When the case was called there was
much excitement in the courtroom. Tbe
commotion was so great that the court
was compelled to ask the bailiff to restore
order. When quiet was restored Justice
Owens announced that he had given the
matter careful consideration and had
perused the evidence thoroughly, and had
concluded to deny the motion to discharge
tbe defendant. The decision nad a very
depressing effect on the defendant, as be
was confident that the motion would be
sustained. Senator White then held a
hurried conversation with his client, after
which he announced that tbe defense had
no evidence to introduce at that time.
Thereupon the court ordered that the de
fendant be held to answer to the Superior
Court on the charge of muruer, under
bonds of $15,000.
BISHOP TATLUR'S PROJECT.
LoÂ» Angeles Business Men Working to
Serure a Utah Line.
LOS ANGEJLES, Cal., Aug. 28.â Great
interest is being taken in the proposition
of Bishop Taylor of Utah looking toward
the construction of a direct railway line
j from Cedar City, Utah, to Los Angeles.
The Merchants' and Manufacturers' Asso
ciation has interested itself in this,
project, and there is active skirmishing
among the business men of the city with a
view of encouraging Bishop Taylor. At
an executive meeting of the directors of
I the association to-night a committee was
appointed to confer with the Bishop, ee
cure his references and plans and investi
gate them thoroughly.
The report of this committee will be the
basis for future action.
This is the second time JJishop Tay'ol
ha 3 interested himself in behali of this
railroad enterprise. Three years ago a
proposition to raise $1,000,000 to carry for
ward the work was under consideration,
and it was in a fair way toward accom
plishment when the Union Pacific notified
the commercial bodies here that it would
build the road on a guarantee of half a
million. This proposition was taken up,
and Bishop Taylor went home. Having
defeated the enterprise, the Union Pacific
was never heard from again on the ques-
GLEN ELLEN ENCAMPMENT.
Father o'Ryan Welcomed to the City of
Tents That Bears His
Name.
GLEN ELLEN, Cal., Aug. 28.â The
morning and evening trains from San
Francisco brought heavy re-inforcements
to the camp of the League of the Cross
Cadets, and also many visitors. The Rev^
Philip O'Ryan< in whose honor the camp j
was named, was met at the depot of the ;
San Francisco and North Pacific Coast j
Railway by all the cadets m camp. He .
was saluted with drawn sabers and a rartle i
of drums, but the boys could not contain
themselves within strict conventional
limits so they yelled and cheered. Father
O'Ryan thanked them and then the cadets
cheered again as he left them at the Mer
vyn Hotel.
The spiritual director of the League was
the lion of the hour, an hour it really
seemed after all, for after taps sounded
and Father O'Ryan attempted to leave
camp without the password the guard sur
rounded him and threw him into the ,
guardhouse. At the solicitation of Father
Yorke, who knew the password, he was re
leased.
The baseball game between picked teams
from Companies H a.id C was the chief
feature of the morning. Company C was

In the afternoon tbe cadets marched to
the Home lor Feeble-minded, about a mile
and a half from camp. They were
cordially received by Dr. Osborne, who
escorted them through the buildings and
magnificent grounds. An entertainment
was provided by the feeble-minded chil

proved a genuine surprise, as the children
had their own band and sang and gave
other exhibitions of intelligent training.
This was one of the most interesting ana
enjoyable experiences of the cadets and
they all returned well pleased with it.

SAD TRAGEDY IN
STOCKTON ASYLUM
While Tied to a Tree, Mrs,
Casey Kills Another
Inmate.
DEATH FROM A KICK.
Her Victim a Mrs. Rossi, Com
mitted Under Another
Name.
ATTENDANTS NOT AT FAULT;
Had Taken Precautions to Prevent
the Maniac Frcm Doing
Violence.
STOCKTON, Cal., Ang. 28.â Tied to â¢
tree in the yard of the female department
of the State Asylum, and with her
hands encased in leather straps, Mrs.
Katherine Casey injured Mrs. Maria Baci
galupi, another patient, so badly that she
died tiii a morning.
Mrs. Casey, who was sent to the institu
tion from Alameda in October, 1894, was
taken by the attendant oat into the yard
connected with the female department
yesterday morning. She is constantly
watched to see that she does herself no
injury, though she has njver been con
sidered violent. Her hands were encased
in leather "muffs," like wristlets, and
these were strapped to a belt about her
body. To make sure that she would not
attempt to get away, Mrs. Cooper, who
had charge of the yard, took the addi
tional precaution to pass another strap
around a tree in the yard and fasten It to
the belt about Mrs. Casey's waist. Think
ing that there was no possibility of her
injuring herself or anybody else, Mrs.
Cooper turned ber back for a moment to
attend to some other patients, and at this
time Mrs. Casey gave Mrs. Bacigalupi the
fatal kick.
Mrs. Bacigalupi thought she saw some
thing disarranged about the Casey
woman's clothing, and went up to her to
fix it. As she did so, Mrs. Casey lifted her
foot and kicked Mrs. Bacigaiupi in the
stomach. Tbe latter was immediately
taken sick, and despite the efforts of the
asylum physicians, died this forenoon at
10:45 o'clock. Soon after receiving the
blow, the unfortunate woman had a nnm
ber of vomiting and these continued
at intervals until she died.
The deceased has been known at the
asylum, where she was committed on De
cember 27, 1889, as Maria Bacigalupi,
having been committed under that name.
Her son, who lives in San Francisco and
visits her frequently, informed Dr. San
derson that ber true name was Rossi. She
was subject to "spells" of insanity, and
had spent much of her life in the asylum
here and that at Napa.
When these fits were not on she was
very docile and sympathetic, and was in
one of these moods when sho went up to
Mrs. Casey to rearrange the latter's dress.
She was committed to tne asylum by
Judge Ellsworth of Alameda County.

STAGE ROBBERY
NEAR HAVILAH,
The Kernville and Caliente
Coach Halted by a
Bandit
TREASURE -BOX TAKEN.
Several Thousand Dollars in
Gold Bullion and Coin
Secured
PASSENGERS LOSE NOTHING.
The Road Agent Believed to Be
Crowley, the Alam;da County
Fugitive.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal.. Ang. 28.â A lone
highwayman stopped the Kernville and
Caliente stage this afternoon at a point
four miles this side of Havilah, relieved it
of Wells, Fargo <fc Co.'s strong box, and
then coolly ordered the driver to proceed
on his way to Caliente. The hoUi-uo oc
curred about 2:30 o'clock, shortly after the
stage had turned over the divide going
down into Walkers Basin, in a little sag
well sheltered by trees and underbrush.
The first intimation of trouble came
when a masked man stepped from behind
a lar^e oak tree, within a few feet of the
road, and leveled a pistol at the driver,
commanding hici to stop the outfit, and
stop it then a:ui there. The driver, obeyed
and brought the team to a sudden stand
still.
'â¢Throw out that box and be in a hurry
about it. Time is precious with me,'' was
i he outiaw's command.
"All right," responded the boyish driver,
"William Sweet.
"Then be in a hurry about it."
By this time the masked bandit had got
on a little rise near the stage, where he
tould better superintend the job. There
were three passengers aboard â Dan Doh
erty, a saloon man of Kernville, Ernest
Brantiheidt and a raining man from Los
Angeles. They were asked if they were
armed, and quickly came a negative repiy
from each. Brantiheidt, who was sick,
added:
'1 have no gun, but you can kill me if
you want to, because I have been thinking
about doing it myseJf."
The box was bolted to the bottom of the
â tage, and when the driver went to throw
it out he informed the highwayman that it
would take some time to get it out.
"Well, then," said the man with the re
volver, "you had better get a crowbar I
have here behind these bushes," pointing
back behind him, "and tear it out, for I
have but little time to fool here."
After about ten minutes, which seemed
to driver and passengers more like ten
hours, the box was torn away, and then
the stoutest looking passenger wasdirecied
by the robber to throw it on the bank
where he was standing. This the pas
senger said he could not do, as it was too
heavy.
"Then drop it out into the road and be
in a hurry about it."
Out it went.
"Drive on now!" was the lastcommand.
The driver did not have to be told twice
to do this. After having gone a short dis
tance Doherty looked back to see what had
become of the robber. He saw him stoop
down ana pick up the box and walk off
with it into the thicket. This was the
last seen of him. The box when empty
weighs about sixty pounds, and it is said
to have contained about $2000 in bullion,
besides sortie coin.
The outlaw wore a mask apparently
made of a flour sack. He was about 5 feet
10 inches high and woald weigh about 160
pounds. He appeared to be about 35 years
of age. He was dressed in a suit of duck,
wore a white felt hat and was clean shaved
and of sandy complexion. He was very
cool and deliberate about his work.
The officers here are notified and will
leave by the first train in pursuit. They
believe that the robber is Bandit Crowley.
REDWOOD CITY NATIVES,
Extensive Preparations for the
Next Grand Parlor
Meeting.
By Giving a Concert San Francisco
Talent Will Assist in Raising
Funds.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Aug. 28.-
When in April last the members of Red
wood City Parlor, Native Sons of the
Golden West, received the news that the
next Grand Parlor was to come to this
city, its members realized that it meant
work and plenty of it for the Native Sons
in this county. A committee of seven of
their ablest workersâ Sheriff W. P. Mc-
Evoy, W. J. Plump, City Clerk D. R. Staf
ford, County Assessor C. D. Hayward, L.
J. Frank, H. W. Schobergand Gny Phelps
Hallâ was appointed to at once begin plan
ning the details for raisins the necessary
funds and securing the good will and co
operation of the citizens of this city ana
vicinity. The nucleus of the fund was ob
tained by giving a ball at the Alhambra
on July 4, which was a financial as well as
social success.
Next Monday evening a concert and en
tertainment will be given at the Alhambra
by some of San Francisco's best-known
artists. Amone them will be the Cliicker
ing quartet, composed of Frank Coffin, P.
M. Ward and 8. E. Tucker of Grace
Church choir and R. F. Tilton, organist at
St. John's; William McDonald, the basso
soloist of Grace Church choir; Miss Mabel
Love, the noted soprano, and Sheriff
Whelan of San Francisco. An overture
will be rendered by the local orchestra.
A fine programme has been prepared
fqr Admission day. Finger's grove has
been secured for the occasion, and at that
place a clambake will be given at noon.
The. afternoon will be devoted to ad
dresses, races, games, athletic exercises
ana dancing. In tne evenipg at 6:30
o'clock a firemen's tournament and open
air band concert will be given in town, the
festivities of the day to close with a ball at
the Al bam bra. From the fact that the
proceeds of these entertainments are to be
devoted exclusively to the "Grand Parlor
fund," and from interest manifested by
Redwood City people and those of neigh
boring towns, it gives promise of being
one of the largest gatherings in the history
of San Mateo County. The parlors at
Mayrield, Menlo Park. Halfmoon Bay and
San Mateo have signified their intention of
joining the local parlor in a parade.
The interest which has been shown in
the success of the Grand Parlor by neigh-
Dcing parlors is most encouraging to the
members here. For instance, Menlo Par
lor has voted to hold its anniversary ball
on Friday, October 23, and devote the pro
ceeds to" the fund. Seaside Parlor will
also give a ball and bold a day of outdoor
sports for the same purpose. San Mateo
Parlor has gi7en notice that "they are
with us to a man." The Native Daughters
of the Golden West are equally as en
thusiastic and will render material assist
ance.

dered to Esquimalt to report to the ad
miral of the British fleet. No other par
ticulars were learned, but it is probable
that the two sealers, if seized, are not far
behind the Jessie.
The Victoria Beatrice belongs to Captain
W. Grant, one of the oldest men in the
sealing business in this city. The schooner
is a 66-ton vessel and is commanded by
W. Peter, a very skilled navigator. Tne

A. P. Jones, and is of 49 tons register.
GAYETY AT DEL MONTE,
Walter Hobart Leads a Charge
Against the Frigidity of
Buriingame.
Mirth and Good Hnmor Now Prevail
Where Bef re Was Conven
tional Iciness,
DEL MONTE, Cal., Ang. 28.â 1t has
been decreed that no more shall Buriin
game be bedecked with icicles here at Del
Monte, and every one seems waking up
and meeting the emergency grandly. The
beautifully illuminated grounds have at
last attracted the notice of the guests of
the hotel and gained well-deserved praise,
and the inhabitants of neighboring towns
were not the only persons who enjoyed
their charming arrangement. To young
Walter Hobart is largely due the change
in the social atmosphere, for his vigorous,
jovial personality makes its effect appar
ent upon those he meets. He laughs and
the world â as represented at Del Monte â
is laughing with him and is happy.
Ed Greenway came down last night, the
first of the old-timers to give Buriingame
the sanction of his presence. Burlingamo
should be duly grateful.
Music divides the hours with light this
year, for what with Huber's orchestra and
Cassasa's band, not to mention the sono
rous tones emitted from Hobart's tallyho
bugle, the air is full of sweet sounds both
day and night.
Mme. Modjeska, the distinguished act
ress, and her husband, Count Charles Bo
zenta Chtapowski, will arrive to-morrow,
and though still much of an invalid, the
famous tragedy queen will greatly enjoy I
the closing events of the meet.
This was polo day, and in the morning
nothing else was talked about. The game i
was to Degin at 3 o'clock on the polo
grounds at Del Monte Park. It was be
twee Buriingame reds and whites, A. F.
Wainwriglit, J. S. Tobin, C. A. Baldwin
and J. Tobin Jr. for the former color, and
W. S. Hobart, R. M. Tobin, J. Lawson and
Cyril Tobin representing the whites.
It was lone before 2 o'clock that the
town spectators arrived to see the game,
but it was 3:30 before any Del Monte rig
came to the grounds. The first to appear
was Baldwin's coach, drawn by his favorite I
four-borse team â two iron- gray wheelers
and a black and a gray as leaders. Mr.
Baldwin was at the whip, with D. O. Mills' I
daughter by his side. On the second seat
were Mrs. J. Donohoe and Miss Tobin !
with Baldwin's pretty bride between them, j
On the rear seat Joe Donohoe and Mr.
Wallach were seated.
Tobin's trap was next, with the two
Misses Tobin and Mr. Francis from Lon
don. Captain Payson and family were
next to arrive, in their pretty private car
riage. F. S. Douty and family soon fol
lowed in one of Del Monte's finest equip
ages. Douglass Dick and family were
close behind. Perry Tarbutt Sr. and Miss
Tarbutt came in their private trap. Then i
Hobart's bugle was heard, and he soon j
drew rein by the polo grounds, driving
his drae, drawn by his favorite four-in
hand team of bays.
J. D. Grant's trap was the next, with
Mr. Grant and Mrs. Gus Spreckels on the
front seat. Mr. and Mrs. Alexander,
uount Cesare Boma, Mrs. Frank Carolan I
completed their party. Mr. and Mrs. Me- j
Calmont, Mr. and Mrs Rawlins and Mr. I
and Mrs. Robinson were in another Del i
Monte rig. Mrs. Easton came out in her '
victoria, with Miss Stowe at her side. In !
another rig were Lord Sudeley, Mr. Wilt- â¢
see and Joe Redding.
The two polo captains decided to have j
three periods of twelve minutes, and two i
minutes' rest between each. "Jack" Cas- i
serley was the timer, while Ed Tobin j
acted as umpire. The game was a dashing i
one from the start. At th* end of the !
third period the score was a tie â two each. '
The whites wanted to play another period,/
but the reds demurred, as their ponies
were exhausted. The whites claimed the
game, and the umpire reserved his de
cision.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 1896.
PYTHIAN HOME
FOR SAN DIEGO,
Infirm Knights Will Find
Rest and Plenty in
the South.
OPEN TO THE WORLD.
California Grand Lodge to Pos
sess the Park Tract and
Buildings.
GIFT OFFERED BY THE CITY.
Funds Now B'ing Raised to Beautiiy
the Structures and
Grounds.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 28.â A fine
home is all ready for the Knights of
Pythias of the State if they wish to take it.
There is considerable evidence that they
are only too glad to eet it. so the prospect
is flattering for the early establishment of
the World's Pythian Home at San Diego.
THE PROPOSED WORLD'S PYTHIAN HOME AT SAN DIEGO.
The perfect climate, fine surrounding
grounds and elegance of the home itself
I will make it a paradise for the aged and
infirm of the order who will enjoy its
shelter.
The proposition on foot is for.the city of
San Diego to give a deed in trust to the
State lodge of the Knights of Pythias for
I the house, outbuildings and grounds
known as the Children's Home in the City
Park. How the city acquired this property
is an interesting story.
About seven years ago when Bryant
Howard was a pillar in the financial
structure of San Diego as president of tho
Consolidated National Bank (since de
funct) he secured from the city, by special
act of the Legislature, 100 acres of the City
Park, under an agreement whereby him
self, James M. Pierce and O. S. Witherby
were to maintain perpetually an orphans'
home, old women's home, school of tech
nology and 3everal other eleemosynary in
stitutions. Bryant Howard was the chief
figure in the deal and when Pierce died he
left a will directing the expenditure of a
large sum in the buildings and grounds.
Witherby did not make much noise, but
in the course of a lawsuit after the suspen
sion of the bank it developed that he was
putting up the larger part of the cash and
giving Howard the credit for it until after
his own death when the world was to be
made acquainted with the fact that
Witherby was the principal benefactor to
the widows and orpnans. Bryant Howard
calmly appropriated all the glory to him
self.
After the failure of the bank Howard
dropped the "park tract," as it is called,
and since then the buildings have been
vacant. Howard testified atone time that
he and bis associates had expended $175,-
000 on the groun ds and the two buildings}
the larger and mo re expensive building;
being the one offered to the Pythians.
This building with one or two outbuild
ings cost $65,000 and ia admirably adapted
to the purposes of a world's home for
Pythians. It is constructed in a summer
like, breezy style of architecture, but at
the same time is a solid and substantial
structure. The grounds were laid out on
an elaborate scale by a trained landscape
gardener and carefully attended for five or
six years.
T.ie whole 100 acres did not receive this
costly treatment. About twenty acres
surrounding the building, however, are in
splendid condition. All kinds of rare
trees, shrubs and semi-tropical plant life
are to be found there. The topographical
character of the ground? is especially
adapted to beautiful adornment. Gently
rolling slopes, stretchine away to an up
land behind the home and down to a deep
ravine to the left, admit of picturesque
grouping of trees and shrub*. On the
sunny south slope of the canyon, running
along the edge for several hundred feet,
are rows of evergreen shrubs laid out to
snell tne word?, "A, sound mind in a
sound body." A mile distant, along the
principal streets, these words can be made
out, spelled in living letters. The heights
are crowned with forest trees planted in
discriminately, affording pleasant shade
and a touch of wildness so much desired
by true landscape artists.
The two Pythian lodges of San Diego
have been working on the plan to secure
this home ever since there was a prospect
of the property reverting to the city. Last
week Judge Putcrbaugn of the Superior
Court rendered a decision giving the city
the 100 acres and all improvements, on
account of the failure of Howard and his
associates to perform their coutract. The
matter is now entirely in the hands of the
iity, subject to approval? by the Legis
lature.
Harry W. Vincent, assistant city clerK,
is secretary of the Pythian Home commit
mit tee of the Grand Lodge. He is actively
working to secure the magnificent prop
erty for the Pythians. A canvass of mem
bers of the City Council resulted in a vir
tual promise of united support in the
undertaking. Judge Stanton L. Carter of
Fresno is chairman of the committee, and
he will prepare the legal documents to be
submitted to the Council. It is not ex
pected that there will be any strong oppo
sition to the plan, as the city has no use
whatever fur the building, ana would be
put to continual expense to keep it up.
The Pythiaiife propose to secure a trust
deed conditioned upon their keeping up
the building and erounds iv perpetuity.
They will ask for~not more than thirty
acres, and probabfy only twenty, but these
wilJ be the highly cultivated lands sur
rounding the home.
After the Council has by ordinance done
all it can to give the deed the matter will
go to the Legislature for approval. There
fore the Pythians do not expect to be able
to establish the home until next year.
But they are gathering funds in the mean
time and working in every way to bring it
about. The State lodge has now $5000 in
the fund, and will have $15,000 to $20,000
when needed to put the home in fine con
dition and buy furniture.
The home is intended to be open to all
aged and infirm Pvthians in the world,
but will be subject to the absolute control
of the California Grand Lodge.
SUICIDE AT SAN JOSE.

Ailments, Ends His Life With
a Bullet
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 28. -William
Gardner, who was formerly prominent in
this county as a dealer in fruit lands and
a handler of fruit, committed suicide tnis
afternoon at Dr. F. H. Bang's sanitarium.
He was a native of New Hampshire, 68
years of age. For some time he had been
suffering from chronic ailments.
Gardner shot himself through the head
with a British bulldog revolver. The act
was not unexpected, as he had often
threatened to take his own life. He was a
man of considerable means, but he had
recently deeded his proper^ to his three
children, Arthur and George Gardner and
Mrs. Ida Lowden.
CAMPBELLS WAIF CARED FOR.

RALLY AT TULARE.
Enthusiasm Suns High at a Gathering
of Republicans.
TULARE, Cal., Aug. 28.â The campaign
for McKinley and sound money was fit
tingly opened here last night. The Visalia
adherents of (he Republican doctrines
came over on a special train and were
greeted at the depot by the Tularo Silver
band and escorted to the outdoor stand on
X street, where an audience of 2500 people
was in waiting. Three cheers and a tiger
were heartily given for McKinley and Ho
bart, also cheers for W. W. Bowers as the
next Congressman from this district.
The speakers of the evening were Colonel
J. P. Jackson of San Francisco and Mrs.
Nellie HolbrookÃllnn of San Jose. Colonel
T. V. Eddy was billed to open the cam
paign here, but arrangements failed and
Colonel Jackson and Mrs. Blinn came on
instead.
They were given a kindiy greeting, and
Tulare gives them a hearty recommenda
tion for the future. Colonel Jackson dis
cussed the money question in a masterly
manner, ana by homely and timely illus
trations snowed clearly the fallacies of the
opponents of sound money. His discus
sion of the tariff question, though brief,
was given close attention and hearty ap
plause. The speech of Mrs. BUrtn was re
plete with burning sarcasm and convinc
ing logic. The first gun of the campaign
was a conspicuous success, and has an ef
fect which will not be lost upon the sov
ereign voters.

THE STOCKTON SITUATION.
The .itnerlcnn Protective Association
Will dominate a Ticket.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 28.â The Amer
ican Protective Association will endeavor
to make itself felt in the November elec
tion either by indorsing candidates nomi
nated by the other parties or putting up a
ticket of its own. The organization will
hold a mass-meeting to-morrow night to
decide whether to adopt the indorsing
plan or to corns out boldly and put up a
ticket. According to a man prominent in
American Protective Association ranks it
s almost certain that the latter plan will
be adopted, but some of the nominees on
tne other tickets maybe put up among
the others.
The organization has already shown
that it proposes to take an active interest
in the campaign and for the past week it
has had two men at work in the County
Clerk's office copying names from the
great register. The names of the Ameri
can Protective Association voters wilt be
arranged according to precincts. In that
way the association can keep track
of its members and see that all have voted
on election day, as well as known just how
many names are on the great register that
are also enrolled in the rosters of the two
councils.
PORTLAND POLITICAL FEUD.
Mayor Pennoyer and li. D. Intnan
Carry Knives for Each Other.
PORTLAND, Or.. Aug. 28.â R. D. In
mau, chairman of the Board of Fire Com
missioners, has resigned because of the
determination of Mayor Pennoyer to
manage the fire department instead of
permitting the Commissioners to do it.
As lnman is a very popular member of
the silver Democracy, his resignation has
caused friction in that party.
Mayor Pennoyer and lnman have been
the two shining lights of the Bryan forces
in this city, the latter having been the
fusionist candidate for Mayor two years \
ago and Pennoyer being the presnt Mayor, j
elected by the same combination. The j
Mayor refused to let the Commissioners
discharge Harry White, a fireman, who
had spoken maliciously of lnman two
years ago in the campaign.
Some weeks ago Paul Wessinger re
signed from the commission because of
the Mayor's statement that every official
under him must vote tor Bryan.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 28.â fbe
delegates to the Gold Standard Democratic
Convention at Indianapolis Jeft for that
city to-night. Tliey are: Will A. Harris,
George J. Lovey and I. H. Johnson. Mr.
Harris before i c started said:
"It is not defiuitely decided that a ticket
will be placod in the field tot represent the
gold Democracy. Personally I favor such
a ticket with Carlisle at its head, if he will
accept. Next to Carlisle my choice is
Henry Wattersou of Kentucky or John
M. Palmer of Illinois. If Watterson does
not have the first place I favor Buckner of
Kentucky for Vice- President."
He believes the effect of the convention
will be to restore to the Democratic party
its time-honored traditions, though by so

"Well, it is all guess work, but I think

telling. Cleveland may get up a war with
England, and an election would be an un
certain thing."

had depreciated. He acknowledged that
he had made mistakes, but stated that they
were on both sides of the line.
Beamer called attention to property
bearing mortgages, stating that there were
219 mortgages in the city, representing
$778,222, that were assessed only $512,125.
Dalton said that there were circumstances
attending these loans that caused more
money to De loaned on lands than they
were worth. As an example, he cited the
Centennial Hotel, on Fourteenth and
Washington streets, which was accepted
as security for more than it was worth at
the time when the Blaira were building
their cable road.
Beamer asked in regard to a large list
of mortgages which were assessed below
their face value. He did not have de
scriptions and locations of the property.
Dalion protested that he was unable to
judge of instances when he was not fur
nished with information sufficient to give
him an idea of tne location of properties.
The discussion of property values in
Murray township was entered into, and
Deputies Winegar and Chadbourn as
sumed the defense. They stated that
assessments had fallen about sss,ooo. Most
of the loss was on vineyards. Landwortn
$100 an acre three years ago could now be
bought for $30. The grape crop was a
failure this year and had failed last year.
Beamer presented data showing somevery
low assessments compared with mort
gages. It was explained that the mort
gages were taken when prices were high,
and were renewed from time to time.
Far into the night the board was en
gaged in making comparisons in mort
gage and property values in Alameda
County real estate, and Assessor Dalton
demonstrated the fact that he was per
fectly cognizant of the art of "standing
pat" on all questions. Forinstance, when
the mooted question as to why he had as
sessed the Oakland Water Company for
the sum of $614,175 only, when the sworn
statement before the City Council placed
the valuat ons on the property at over
$5,000,000, Mr. Dalton retorted:
"The sworn statement has nothing to
do with me. I simply assess the property
as I find it."
Then Equalizer Beamer produced list
after list of individual a r 3essments of
private holdings, showing that they were
hot assessed within 50 per cent of their
appraised values. The following table of
mortgaged property in various portions of
Alameda County was then produced by
the board, showing that the property was
not assessed for the amount of. the mort
gage upon it:

His Fender a Success.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 28.â Ira P.
Clarke of Alameda made a remarkable
test of his car fender in the presence of
the City Trustees and streetcar officials.
After it had picked up a dummy several
times, Clarke lay diagonally across the
rails and told the motorman to go back
fifty yards and "turn her loose." Friends
and strangers tried to dissuade him from
making such a test, but he insisted on
it. He lay face downward putfing a cigar,
and the car came on and the fender
picked him up so gently that the only
damage done was to remove a button
from the jumper he wore.

AT SAN JOSE,
Hale's Hall Is Crowded and
Hundreds Are Turned
Away.
POLICY OF REPUBLICANS
The General Compares Records
of the Two National
Parties.
DEMOCRACY'S PAST MISRULE.
Failing in All Else, It Now Seeks
Victory Upon a Dishonest
Platform.
SAN JOSE, Cax., Aug. 28.â The meeting
held this evening under the auspicee of
the Santa Clara County Republican Club
was a great demonstration of approval of
the Republican standard-bearers and the
policy of the party of patriotism, protec
tion and prosperity. General W. H. L.
Barnes received an ovation. It seemed as
if all San Jose wanted to hear the great
California orator. Hale's Hall was
crowded to its utmost capacity, many be
ing compelled to stand and hundreds were
turned away.
The hall was well tilled long before the
speaker of the evening arrived. As a large
delegation of the Union battlefield veter
ans, headed by drum and fife corps,
marched into the hall the crowd greeted
the old soldiers with salvos of applause.
General W. H. L. Barnes was escorted
to the stage by E. A. Hayes, president of
the Republican Club, and William Mair,
and was given a rousing reception. The
auditors included many ladies, ail of whom
manifested decided interest in the address.
There was a large delegation present
from the Santa Clara County Republican
League and the Republican Club of the
University of the Pacific was out iv force.
There were sixty students iv all and after
a rousing demonstration on the outside
they marched into the hall and made
their presence felt whenever the oppor
tunity for a demonstration arose.
President E- A. Hayes called the meet
ing to order. Otis Harreil sang "The
McKinley Song" and was compelled to re
spond to an encore. President Hayes
then introduced General W. H. L. Barnes,
the speaker of the evening. This was the
signal for another demonstration. The
address of General Barnes was eloquent,
logical and convincing, and at times had
an electrical effect on tbe vast audience.
He said in part:
My friends, experience has taueht me one
thing about which, in this doubtful world of
ours, tnere is no doubt whatever. I am always
prepared to support wnat the conservatism of
thf Republican party in National Convention
assembled decides is the best lor our country
at home and abroad. Twenty-seven years of
power proved the capacity of the .Republican
parry to successfully conduct our Government,
and s-.ven years of ihe Democratic party shows
that it is only qualified for misrule.
Thf Republican party alone saved the Union
and by wise legislation reconstructed the re
bellious States. It has always protected our
Industries and has been a consistent advocate
nt a welt-devised scheme of reciprocity In
order to secure a foreign market for our sur
plus products. It has always favored a free
ballot and an honest count, and to-day it
stand for sound money. [Applause.]
With such a record it may well be asked why
the Republican party should .have ever been
defeated.
In 1884 the Democratic party raised a gen
eral howl of dishonesty. They wanted to see
the books. The people granted their wish,
but the Democrats found that, although the
Republican party had expended enormous
sums in building up the Nation, not a single
dollar had been stolen, misappropriated or
lost. [Applause.]
In 1t?92, the Democratic party assailed the
protective policy. The people, for the moment,
were induced to believe that free trade would
beneiit the workingmen, but three years oft
Grover Cleveland's second administration '
proved their mistake. To-day the Democratic
party is shirking the issue of the tariff, and
puts out free silver as its platform.
The Republican platform is for sound money.
It is not in favor of allowing owners of silver
bullion to deposit it at the mints and have it j
coined into alleged silver dollars, compelling !
the people to accept such dollars as a full legal j
tender.
It is not in favor of allowing people to settle j
their obligations at 50 cents on the dollar. It
is not in lavor of the free coinage of silver at a
ratio of 16 to 1, which means simply that an
ounce of silver is to be $1 29 by law, wnen its '
commercial value is but 68 cents. I read to- â 
day that silver was quoted at 66 y t cents.
The Republican party believes in gold and j
silver, maintained at a parity, and seeks an in- I
ternational agreement that will make our sil
ver acceptable ail over the world for all trans- I
actions. The Republican plan is plainly hon- j
est; the Democratic plan is plainly dishonest. |
One is founded on the experience of ages and
the other is a new-found theory.
One is a safe reality, and the other a
dangerous dream. The Republican party is I
right, and the silver wing of the old Temo
cratic party is wrong, as It always has been.
[Applause.]
The address was well received through
out, and the meeting closed with three
cheers for McKinley and Hobart, ana
three cheers and a tiger for General
Barnes.
THE WEAVERVILLE TRIAL.
Joe Gregory's Friends Attempt
the Impeachment of Two
Witnesses.
Gun-Fighters Are Numerous in the
Town and a Clash of Factions
May Occur.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Aug. 28.â The
trial of Joe Gregory for complicity in the
murder of "Jack" Littlefield last Septem
ber is drawing to a close. To-day the
prosecution rested and the taking of evi
dence for the defense began. The presence
of "Cattle King" George E. White in the
courtroom added to tbe interest in the
case.
On the streets to-night there was little
outward demonstration, but the most
desperate gun-fighters of Northern Cali
fornia are in Weaverville at present, and
it would need but a spark to bring on a
bloody conflict between the faction?.
One of the first witnesses this morning
was J. M. Kelley. a vaquero, one of tbe
three who made the midnight ride from
Covelo vith a Call reporter, who gave to
the world the first authentic news of the
dastardly killing of poor "Jack" Little
field. He stated that on the 28th day of
September, 1805, he had visited the grave
of Littleneid. Unon examiningclosely the
ground in the immediate vicinity he came
upon the tracks of two horses and a bare
footed mule which had been tethered in a
near-by ravine to some saplines. One of
the horses bad palled back upon his
tether as if frightened. This was shown
by the tracks and the lacerated bark on
the tree. He then followed the tracks
down the ravine to a small fork of Red
Mountain Creek, where they disappeared
in the water. One of the tracks was large
and had been made by a newly shod horse.
When Gregory left Haydon's house he
was mounted on a uor>e newly shod.
Deputy Attorney-General Post an
nounced that the people would rest their
case, with the privilege of introducing one
other witness when he should arrive. To
the surprise of all he stated that the wit
ness was Gordon Van Horn, who has been
widely sought for throughout Norttern
California since the Van Horn and Crow
trial, and who was at last located at Whit
ney, Mendocino County. Gordon Van
Horn, the brother to the sentenced Bayles
Van Horn, arrived in Weaverville to-night
with his father on the stage.
Oregon Sanders, before examining his
witnesses for the defense, arose and said
that he would make no opening statement
to the court except that Gregory was not
guilty. A number of witnesses were put
on to impeach the testimony of Frank
Doolittle and Frank Hanover, who were
said by the "good" people of Round Val
ley to be "bad men."
Among those to make this declaration
was Thomas Henley, a brother oi ex-Con
gressman Barclay Henley. When asked
upon what ground he based his assertion
he stated that Hanover once tried to get
up a boxing-match in Covelo with Frank
McDonald, which shocked the moral
sensibilities of that virtuous community,
whose gentle pastimes have been occa
sional hanging bees and the shooting of
men in the back. That the witness nad
even gone to the exertion of circulating a
petition to the authorities that it be
stopped. One Rohrbough, George White's
partner, also said that it was a disgraceful
affair and a blot on the community, and
should be suppressed.
"Then a prizefighter is a bugaboo to the
people of Round Valley?" asked Post, and
Henley admitted that he was.
"Their taste goes more to lynching and
shooting," remarked Post.
Mr. Post asked the witness why he in
terested himself in the defense of persons
charged with murder who were not his
friends and not even intimate acquaint
ances. Henley replied that he considered
Littlefield a very bad man. He was steal
ing from everybody, indiscriminately, and
his reputation was as bad as a man's
could be.
The witnesses for the defense contra-
dieted the evidence of Doolittle and
Hanover, and by way of variety contra
dicted themselves. But all laid stress up
on the fact that Hanover was a "bad man
who promoted prize-fighting.
LOS ANGELES CLUMN UNITE.
A Federation of Republican Organ
ization* Effected.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 28. â A
meeting of the Republican clubs of the
city and county was held in the parlors of
the Westminster Hotel yesterday to
perfect an organization to be known as
the Federation of Republican Clubs of Los
Angeles County. The object of the federa
tion is to \ secure unity of action and to
more thoroughly and effectively distribute
literature and "i send speakers to needed
points. Nearly all the clubs in the county
were represented by the presidents, secre
taries or proxies. Owing to the short
time elapsing between the call and the
meeting, some of the wards of the city
were not represented, but they have all
signified their intention to co-operate.
Frank Dominguez extended an invitation
to the new organization to make its head
quarters with the Young Men's Republi
can League in the Stowell block. ' The in
vitation was accepted and a vote of thanks
extended to the league.
Mayor and Aldermen Go to Jail.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Aug. 28.â Judge
Hazelrig this morning reinstated the in
junction against the Mayor and the Board
of Aldermen, restraining them from pro
ceeding in the impeachment proceedings
against the Board of Public Safety, Judge
Tonev having dissolved the injunction
soon "after granting it. This means that
the Mayor and Aldermen will be sent to
jail to-morrow for contempt of court, and
knocks out all impeachment proceedings.
COURSING MATCHES.
Secretary Hulbrook Will Keep His
Weather Eye Open for Scenes
of Cruelty.
Despite the fact that the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has de
cided to taKe no immediate action in rela
tion to the rabbit hunts at the Presidio
athletic grounds an eye will be kept upon
the place to see that no cruelties take
place there under the name of sport. The
society found no fault with Secretary Hol
brook's action in stopping the coursing
matches, and he will abide by the line of
procedure which he has marked out for
himself and his assistants.
''I don't like to break up men's sport,"
said Mr. Holbrook yesterday, "but cruelty
caunot be tolerated. If I were convinced
that tuese coursing matches were not
cruel my attitude toward them would be
different. As it is, I see no reason for
changing ray tactics."

The Decision of the Referee in This
Latter Case Gives Some Dis

At 8 o'clock last evening Woodward's
Pavilion was the scene of as wild and surg
ing a mob as ever assembled to witness a
prizefight in the history of the City. A
political mass-meeting would have been
The Scene in the Pavilion at "Woodward's Gardens When Choynski
and McAuliffe Shook Hands in the 24-Foot Ring.
consigned to the shades of oblivion in
comparison.
Captain Withman, as usual, had a large
cordon of police officers on hand to keep
the crowd in order, both inside and out
side the pavilion. It required all the
strength and patience they possessed to do
their duty, and as the last straggler passed
in at the gate every man of that cordon
drew an immense sigh of relief and mopped
the perspiration from his dripping brow,
something be had no time to do before.
On the inside as exciting scenes were
being transacted as in the open air. Billy
Daly, to whom is due the chief credit for
putting the pavilion in order for the series
of contests, together with a large staff of
assistants, was kept busily engaged in
directing holders of slips to their seats.
â¢â¢Youne Mitchell" was omnipresent, look
ing first to the comfort of the most <lis
tinguisbed auditors and then to the ring
arrangements.
A i: lance around at the assembled
human mass showed a most curious spec
tacle. The vast pavilion, both gallery,
balcony and main floor, was jammed with
people. They were crowded together as
thick as sardines. Men stood up in the
aisles, clung to the posts, crowded the
walls behind the seats any anywhere they
could find a foothold.
The most curious spectacle of all was
the sight of the Chinese Consul, who Kit
close to the stage in company with nine of
his brethren from the Flowery Kingdom,
and paid strictest attention to everything
that passed. Those Chinese were the
most orderly people in the house. The
grave taciturnity for which the yellow
race is noted never deserted them, and
they might have been graven images
for all the emotion they manifested.
Their interest, however, was evinced by
the steady and unflinching gaze they kept
on the stage.
The (.Teat audience howled and yelled
itself hoarse at various events of minor
interest even before the battles began.
And when the fighting commenced the
pandemonium reigned supreme.
THE FIGHTS.
A Technical Description of the Con-
test by Rounds.
The evening's fistic entertainment
opened with a six-round bout between
Cuoeo and Fowler. The contest can be
summed up in a very few words. Cuneo
led from the start and made a chopping
block of Fowler, who has much to learn
yet of the art of fisticuffs.
Gub Herget and "Spider" Kelly were
the next brace of pugilists to appear.
Herget was 'squired by Jimmy Carroll,
Billy Dunnigan and Alf Walker. Kelly
was looked after by Billy Akers, Jim Gal
lagher and Jerry Sullivan. The betting
was $10 to $7 in favor of Herget. The
fighters appeared to be in good condition
and pave promise of "putting no" a slash
ing mill.
There was considerable difficulty in the
selection of a referee. Several names were
proposed, but from some unexplained
reason tie parties selected by Hie fighters
refused to act. Finally at the immediate
request of Billy Jordan, the master of
ceremonies, "Boey" O'Donnell, a prom
inent sporting character who is known to
all of the local sports, agreed to enter the
ring and decide upon the merits of the
mill to his best knowledge. Just before
the men stepped to the scratch the master
of ceremonies delivered himself in this
wise: "Gentlemen, please stop smoking
and give us a little fresh air." His request
was granted.
At the tap of the bell the fighters got to
work. The "Spider" landed on Herget's
nose. Kelly had the best uf the early part
of the round, but Herget "got a move on"
toward the finish and landed several
straight lefts on Kelly's face.
In the second round Herget ducked
cleverly from left swings, and a very
lively exchange of blows followed. Kelly's
nose was oleeding and he rubbed the
organ at every chance on Herget's shoul
der, giving some people the impression
that he was biting Herget. Gus had
much the best of the round, although
Kelly was fighting gamely.
Third round â Kelly caught Herget a
sharp left swing on the jaw, but he re
ceived a body punch in return that
evened up matters. Herget was smiling
blandly, but a few stiff blows brought a
determined appearance on his face. Kelly
was devoting considerable attention to
Herget's short ribs, while the latter was
seemingly satisfied to keep planting his
left in Kelly's face.
Fourth roundâ This was a hot give-and-
take round, with Kelly in the lead. He
kept Herget on the move and landed the
most blows.
Fifth roundâ Kelly started in wickedly,
and it was biff, bang from start to finish.
The excitement was intense as the figtit
ers pummueled at each other with right
and left. Kelly was growing weak toward
the close, while Herget seemed strong and
able to go the distance. No very punish
ing blows were delivered, however. It
was more a test of endurance, as several
wild blovs were struck.
Sixth roundâ Both men tire.l after their
fifth round and the exchanges were not so
rapid. Herget waa constantly shooting
his left over Kelly's shoulder and missing
the "Spider's" nose. Keily was weak, but,
nevertheless, he did not fail to get home
some hot ribroasters.
Seventh roundâ Nothing of a very ex
ing nature occurred. The fighters were
tired, and with the exception of an oc
casional rally at close quarters the con
test was comparatively uninteresting. It
was give arid take, neither having ap
parently any advantage.
Eightn nund- Uninteresting â tip- tap
and go to your corners.
Ninth round â The same as the round
preceding, with some good ducking on
Herget's part.
Tenth round â This round was hammer
and tongs from gong to gong, and as
Herget was ttie aggressor it was certainly
nis round. The referee decided in favor
of Kelly, but good judges of pugilistic en
counters thought that Herget had done
the cleanest hitting and stopping and
should have been declared the winner,
but referees have their own opinions.
THE BIG BATTLE.
McAuliffe Lasts Three Rounds and
Is Put to Sleep by Choynski
In the Fourth.
At 10:20 o'clock, immediately after the
finish of the Herget and Kelly fight, Joe
Choynski and his seconds, Eddie Graney
and E. Tillson, appeared and selected the
southwest corner of the ring. Joe smiled
lovingly at his frieads, and looked con
fident as he glanced at his big opponent,
Joe McAuliffe, who took a position in the
opposite corner. McAuliffe was looked
after by Professor Barney Farley, Vincent
White and Alexander Greggains.
Australian uilly Smith, who was se
lected as referee of tbe match, took an
easy position, reclining against one of the
ropes while the fighters were making
ready for action.
Professor Farley was in the meantime
instructing his boy what to do and how to
put i is big right duke on Choynski's jaw.
Smith finally called the fighters to the
center of the ring and imparted to them
some little advice as regards clinching and
foul fighting, after which he called time
and tbe gong sounded the pugilists to the
scratch. McAuliffe looked liice a moun-
( tain of beef when he placed himself in
front of his muscular ami ar tive opponent.
Choynsfci fiiMJe I and foo c.l around big
Joe.'and the y>ebp <â¢ smiled at tbe tactics
of the clever prolesMimal who has been
through many harti mills.
It would bean injustice to the readers
of The Call to give a technical description
of the tight by rounds, as McAuliffe did
not display a particle of science and relied
entirely on his push-blow system of fight
ing to win him a victory. He appeared to
be clumsier than ever on bis feet, and
some of the reaches he made at clever Joe
were quite amusing because of their un
couthness.
The hrst round was not in the least bit
interesting, as Choynski did not make
any attempt to mix things with his big
opponent. In the second round McAu
liffe managed, by stiffening nis left hand,
to keep Choynski at a safe distance, but
little Joe warmed big Joe's ribs with right
hand jabs until near the end of the tounk
when McAuliffe happened to catch Choy"
ski a good stop on the nose.
In the third round Choynski discovered
that McAuliffe's push blows were not
dangerous and he mixed things up a lit
tle by way of experiment. He found that
he could smash his big adversary at short
range and evidently decided upon giving
the tanner a cocktail or in other words a
mixed rally in the fourth round. When
the gong sounded the men to the scratch
Choynski fiddled around his big and awk
ward opponent Jike a cat playing with a
mouse, occasionally tapping McAuliffe on
Ihe nose to draw him out.
Finding that this system would not
work satisfactorily, Choynski dashed in
side of the big fellow's guard and a mix
up followed, out of which the bin giant
came a whipped man. As he stumbled
backward in an awkward manner against
the ropes near his corner, Choynski
leaped at him, and as quick as a flash he
sent his left across McAuliffe's cheek and
the right followed on the jaw, but it was
not hard enough to knock McAuliffe out.
The big fellow had had enough of the
game, however, and dropped to the floor
like a sack of sand, where he remained
until counted out.
There is no use in kicking a dog when
he is down, but suffice it to say that Mc-
Auliffe is about the poorest specimen of a
fighter that ever entered a ring, and his
friends are in hopes that he will show
sufficient judgment to get back to a tan
nery as quickly as possible and give up
future hopes of ever attaining success in
the prize ring.
AFTER THE FIGHTS.
Stelzner and Peppers Will Box
Next Wednesday Evening at
the Pavilion.
As McAuliffe fell and was counted out
pandemonium reigned. Everybody jumped
into the air and yelled; hats were waved
and canes flourished. To add to the con
fusion the chairs in many parts of the
building broke and precipitated their occu
pants among those lower down. Several
free fights were narrowly avoided, but the
unruly element was quelled by the police.
The general trend of opinion as gleaned
from the grout>B collected here and there
as the crowd slowly filed <Â»ut of the build
ing was that McAuliffe will never be heard
of aeain. Words of admiration for Choy
nski's wondrous coolness and speed were
hoard on all sides.
Dissatisfied expressions as regards the
decision in the Kelly-Herget contest were
heard. The belief generally prevailed
that Herget should have had the decision,
as he forced the fighting, or the event, at
most, should have been declared a draw.
Billy Jordan, master of ceremonies,
climbed upon the platform immediately
before the last of the rounds, and an
nounced that owing to sickness Gallagher
would not meet George Green before the
Colma Club at Grove's Theater next
Wednesday evening, but that a fight be
tween Peppers and Stelzner had been ar
ranged, and would take place at Wood
ward's Pavilion on the foregoine date.
This statement was greeted with cheers.

Expected to Win or He Would Not
Have Entered the
Fight.
Joe Choynski was seen in his room im
mediately after the fighters had retired
from the ring. He had just been rubbed
down by his attendants and appeared in
fine form, not a scratch showing on
his face or body. He was in the best of
humor, but did not appear inclined to do
much talking.
"You may simply say for me," he said,
"that I expected to win this fight or I
should not have entered it. As regards
the time 1 believed it would take me, tbat
is nard to answer. I might have got an
opportunity to do him up in twenty sec
onds and it might have occurred in the
last round.
"But I entered the fi-jrht to win. The re
sult you see. McAuliffe personally is a
fine fellow and I like 1 im very much, but
for a prize-fighter he's entirely too slow.
I kn^w in the third round when he ap
peared almost dazed that I had him, and
made up my mind to go in tÂ»nd finish him
in the fourth."
McAULIFFE'S VERSION.
Says He Had No Idea Choynski
Is So Good a
Man.
Immediately after McAuliffe entered
his dressing-room the door was closed,
and admission was secured with much
difficulty. After the fight the "Mission
Giant" was rubbed down by his> attend
ants, and the effects of the punishment he
had received from his hard-hitting oppo
nent were made more manifest in his
bruised face and swollen eyes. Directly
under his left eye was a deep cut, from
which the blood had hardly ceased to
flow.
Off to one side Alex Greggains, one of
McAuiiffe's seconds, was donning his coat,
while old Barney Farley was standing to
one side regarding his protege with a look
of mingled sorrow and commiseration.
"I never had the least idea that Choyn
ski was such a magnificent fighter,"
mournfully admitted McAuliffe, "or I
should for no consideration have met him
with only live weeks' training. Choynski
is the hardest hitter I ever went up
against.
"One thing is certain â I would have re
quired fully six weeks more to have got
into sufficiently good form to meet him.
I have entered the ring for the last time.
No more of it for me; it takes too long to
get into condition. But Cboynski is a ter
rific fighter."
OTHER IDEAS.
Barn&y Farley, Alex Gregrgrains,
"Young Mitchell" and tho
Chinese Consul.
"Well,' 1 said "Young Mitchell," "as re
gards the outcome of the series of fights I
have nothing to say. You could not ex
pect me to say anything in the case of my
brother, anyway.
"But there is one thing I want to men
tion. That is, the hall is the most nearly
perfect of its kind in this country, and
every man was able to get his seat in short
order.
"Gus Bays he is contented now to go
back to his stand behind the bar and is
perfectly cheerful over the outcome. We
have rented tne Pavilion to the National
Club for their series of contests next
Wednesday evening."
Poor old Barney Farley was almost over
come. It seemed as if he could hardly
realize that all was over and his pride
sent into the darkness of forgetfulness.
"Choynski is a good man," he admitted,
"and Joe was not in condition to meet
him. He ought to have had longer train
ing, but still I did think he was in fine
enough form to last the eight rounds."
Joe may be a defeated pugilist, but Bar
ney will not forsake him. His was the
first hand to greet him when he was led to
his corner and the one that held tbe
giant's hand the last as they departed
together.
Greggaina said the outcome was exactly
what he in common with the others looked
for.
As ail emerged from the dressing-room
the Chinese Consul and his staff were still
lingering outside.
"Don't want to get caught in big crowd,"
he explained. "Velly fight. Big
man he too slow. Little man he hit heap
hard."

Jacobson for All His
Ready Money.
The Dramatic Effect of a Fail
ing Memory Properly
â â  Treated;
Mr. Jacobson Got Jobs by Advertising
in â¢â¢ The Call," but Never This
Kind of One.
Wben A. Jacobson of 409 Pacific street
advertised yesterday morning for a posi
tion as an experienced winemaker he did
not dream that he would receive a caller
in answer to it by 9 o'clock, but he did.
At that hour a very elegant, smooth
and clean-shaved young man about 21
years of age appeared and told Mr. Jacob
son that his employer had a ranch up in
tbe Sonoma Valley and desired to employ
a winemaker. He was rather critical and
indifferent in las questions, which had
the usual effect of making a man out of
work more anxious for a job.
The young man said his employer was
the manager of the Pacific Fruit-packing
Company at 804 Stockton street, which is
some distance in the realm of Chinatown.
Would Mr. Jacobson travel up there with
him and see the boss? Mr. Jacobson, of
course, would, and up they went.
No. 804 Stockton street is a large brick
building, with a business-looking front.
Inside also it is full ot fruit and business
and girls. The name of the boss was
given as Mr. Cook. As soon as tbe nice,
smoott -shaven young man and Mr. Jacob
son appeared tbe boss stepped briskly for
ward from the office.
He greeted Mr. Jacobson with the
warmth and cordiality of a long -lost
brother, and after somebrief conversation
told the unsuspecting Jacobson that he
was just the man ha was looking for.
Jacobson was engaged on the spot at $45
per month, with board. Mr Cook told Mr.
Jacobson that they would sail over to Tib
uron on the ferry and take the afternoon
train for the valley. He told him, also, to
come back to the office at noon as he might
think of something else to talk to him
about.
During a portion of this time Mr. Jacob
son said the nice, smooth-faced and well
dressed young man went back and chatted
pleasantly with the young ladies who
handle the juicy fruit with knives and
dainty fingers. 'He said the young man
acted as though talking to girls was an
everyday episode with him.
Suddenly "the boss," Mr. Cook, brought
himself up with a jerk like a man who had
been suddenly prodded with a pin. His
memory had jarred him. Mr. Cook said
something about having taken treatment
for failing memory and that it did him so
much good tnut when be did remember he
remembered powerfully, suddenly and
with great effect. He had just recollected

FOUR GOOD~SHORT STORIES
S HARPER & BROTHERS, Publishers, New York
that ho wanted to see a Mr. Kohlbeck, an
old and very dear friend of His, who had
been a wine-broker for the Doge of Venice
or some other distin_'iiisliel;European per
sonage whose name Mr. Jacboson dad lor
jrottenin the rapidity of subsequent events.
This Mr. Koh beck, who seems to be a
creation of Mr. Cook's revived memory,
was said by the boss to live near the
corner of Van Ness avenue and California
street. He was desirous that Mi. Jacob
son should go up there with him and have
a chat with the venerable and retired
winemaker of Van Neas avenue. Pos
sibly he could pick up a few European
ideas with which to flavor the wine of the
Sonoma vineyard.
The boss left Mr. Jacobson af the corner
while he strolled down Van Ness avenue
to see if Mr. Kohlbecic was at home. Mr.
Jacobson said he did not notice where
"the boss" went, but in a few minutes he
returned expressing great regret that Mr.
Kohlbeck had gone downtown.
Here the scene of a common drama of a '
great city changes. Not a hired assassin
comes on tne stage with a knife in his
teeth, but a second villain steps nimbly
across the street, and is so Rlad to see Mr.
Cook. The stranger is in such a hurry to
tane a tral.i out of tne Â«'ity that he
scarcely has time to be introduced to Mr.
Jacobson. The stranger is also unfor
tunately short of cash, and flashing a
check Degs Mr. Cook to cash it. "The
boss" is short of the amount of money
called for by the face of the check, and the
two are in a quandary until "the boss' "
revived memory comes to the rescue, and
his face is as benign and radiant as a har
vest moon.
He asked Mr. Jacobson if he had any
money.
Mr. Jacobson dad every cent of $18.
Would Mr. Jacobson loan it to him 80
that he could accommodate his friend?
Every cent of Mr. Jacobson' s $18 went
into the open palm of the boss and a mo
ment later dropped with a pleasant jingle
of about the ratio of 1 to 16 into the
pocket of the stranger, who was in a
hurry.
A car happened along just then, bound
down the MIL "The boss" and the
stranger made a dash for it, the former
shouting to the accommodating Mr.
Jacobson to be sure and call at the office
at noon. Waiving a pleasant adieu to Mr.
Jacobson "the boss" and the stranger and
the streetcar soared over the brow of the
hill and disappeared.
Then Mr. Jacobson stood alone and re
flected. Then he began to realize. Then
he walked to the brow of the hill and
gazed sadly after the car and his $18.
"I've got jobs through The Call be
fore," said Mr. Jacobson yesterday after
noon, "but I never got jobbed like that.
The boss being in the fruit-packing com
pany's office is what fooled me and threw
me off my guard. He acted as though he
belonged there. The manager of the
fruit-packing company told me that he
saw me talking with the man, but said he
supposed we had business together. He
said he did not know the man at all, nor
the young fellow who called on me. The
boss was about 5 feet 2 inches tall, dark
complected and my first Impression on
seeing him was that he was not to be
trusted. The stranger who came across
the street was of middle size. He had a
black mustache, side whiskers, close
cropped hair and wore a dark suit. He
looked like a Jew."
The manager of the Pacific Frnit-pacfc
ing Company is Lew Hing, a Chinaman.
His principal assistant is a Chinaman,
and there are other Chinamen around the
place. It appears to be a Chinese institu
tion.

FOB PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM HcKINLET, of Ohio
rOK TICF-FRHSIDI-NT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
Cleveland 19 certainly not saying any
thing, but is he sawing wood ?
As the Republican platform is a guar
antee of prosperity every citizen should
indorse it.
The people wish silver and gold, not sil
ver only, and that is why they will vote
for McKinley.
No law-abiding Democrat will support
an attack on the Supreme Court, in order
to please Altgtld.
In practical politics the only way to up
hold Republican principles is to uphold
Republican leaders.
There is no interest of this country that
isn't threatened in some way by the
declarations of the Chicago platform.
A short time ago the Democrats were
mocking at McKinley because be did not
talk, and now they are howling that he
talks too much.
Before we trust Democrats with the
task of revising tbe currency we had better
consider a little what success they had in
revising the tariff.
When the bay orator started on Lis
career the people put the emphasis on the
orator, but they are now putting tne
emphasis on the boy.
The aim of all true Republicans at this
time is to solidify tbe party, and those
who have any other aim are not worthy
to be called Republicans.
More money in circulation, and not
more money in the mints, is what is needed
to make business good, and so all the busi
ness men of the country are supporting
the Republican ticket.
We do not mean to say that all su
ers of Bryan would like to see serious dis
turbances in this country, but it is certain
that all who are seeking to make disturb
ance are supporting Bryan.
Ko one can read the Chicago platform
without seeing how grave is the crisis the
party behind it has forced upon the coun
try, and the candidate is every bit as radi
cal and dangerous as the platform.
McKiniey stands on the money question
to-day exactly where he has always stood,
and his attitude on that issue as on the
tariff has always been consistent with it-
Belf at every stage of his political career.
"The future is written in blood crushed
out of you by gold," said Bryan in a speech
at Erie; and now the people have to con
sider whether a man who talks like that
Is fit to be President of a well-ordered re
public.
Don't forget that this is tbe day to leave
orders for The Sunday Call, and make
Bure of good reading to-morrow. It will
be found to contain matters of interest to
every member of the family, including the
children.
The people have begun to see that Bryan
Is supported by the worst element of the
Democratic and Populist parties; and it
appears that Bryan sees it also, for it is to
those elements he appeals in ail his
speeches.
Major McKinley's letter of acceptance
put all the issues of the campaign so
clearly and so strongly that the voter
needs no other campaign document. It
points to prosperity and shows the way to
get there.
"My friends," said ex-President Harri
son, "as a Republican lam proud of many
things, but I can sum tip as the hignest
satisfaction I have had in the party and
Us career that the prospect of Republican
success never did disturb business."
By the time the people begin to under
stand that tbe Republican party stands
(or cenuine bimetallism as opposed to
the Bryanites
begin to dodge tbe money question as
eagerly as they now dodge the tariff.
The gold Democrats who wish the Rer
publican party to drop the tariff issue in
this campaign have been well answered
by President Harrison in the declaration:
"They must not expect that the Republi
can party will reorganize itself because
the Democratic party has disorganized
Itself.' 1
In 1892 when workingmen had good
(cages under the McKinley tariff the
people of the United States consumed
Â»ver 386,000,000 bushels of wheat and over
1,983,000,000 bushels of corn, and the
farmer was prosperous, but in 1895 under
Democratic conditions the people con
lumed but 315.000,000 bushels of wheat
md 1,184,000,000 bushels of corn, and the
armer bad hard times and a lesson on the
jariff question.
THE PEOPLE AROUSED.
More than 30,000 people applied for ad
mission tickets to Carnegie Hall, New
YorK, Thursday night, to hear ex-Presi
dent Harrison discuss the political issues
now before the country. It could not have
been mere curiosity to see and hear the
speaker that prompted so many to want
to participate in the meeting, for Mr. Har
rison has talked to New York audiences
many times and he is by no means a
stranger to the people of that city. He is
a good platform speaker, but not nearly so
pleasing and interesting as Depew,
Cockran and a dozen other citizens of New
York. It must be, then, that Mr. Har
rison would have something to say which
the people were particularly anxious to
hear that caused so gtvat a demand for
admission tickets.
It was known that Mr. Harrison would
analyze the platform of the Bryanites and
point out where and how it made war
upon thÂ« fundamental principles of the
Government, and how tbe social and in
dustrial Btrength of the country would be
weakened if Bryanism prevailed at the
November election. The people of New
York feel, as the people everywhere feel,
that the country is approacning a crisis
almost as serious as tbe one which con
fronted it in 18C1. and it is but natural
that they would want information and
advice from such a conservative and wise
statesman as Benjamin Harrison.
The ex-President is never an enthusiast,
nor is he ever blinded by prejudice, but
he is always a cool, level-headed, logical
reasoner who places the general good of
the country above everything else.
In reading Mr. Harrison's speech the
people will know that it he sees danger to
our institutions in any of the declarations
of the Bryan party it may be taken for
granted tnat there is danger. If he sounds
the alarm it is not because he is an alarm
ist, but because there is cause for alarm.
If he warns the people that their institu
tions are threatened the people may rely
upon it that they are threatened. When
it comes to an issue such as is now before
the country, Mr. Harrison reasons along
the cold and exacting lines leading from
cause to effect, and his deductions may be
accepted as economic truths.
Perhaps no man in tbe United States
watched with keener interest the proceed
ings of the Chicago convention than did
ex- President Harrison, and this is his con
clusion: "The atmosphere of fhe Chi
cago convention was surcharged with the
spirit of revolution. This platform was
carried and its nominations made with
accompanying incidents of frenzy that
startled the onlookers and amazed the
country.
"The courts and the President were ar
raigned for enforcing the laws, and gov
ernment by the mob was given preference
over government by the law, enforced by
the court decrees and by executive orders.
â¢'The spirit that exhibited itself in this
convention was so wild and strangely en
thused that Mr. Bryan himself likened it
to the zeal that possessed the crusaders
when they responded to the impassioned
appeals of Peter the Hermit to rescue the
sepulcher of our Lord from tbe hands of
the infidels.
"His historical illustration was more
potent and more forcible than he knew,
for the zeal of the crusaders was a blind
and ignorant zea.l; they sought to rescue
the transient and ineffectual sepulcher
that had held the body of the Son of God,
while they trampled upon the precepts of
love and mercy which he had left for their
guidance in life.
"rie told us that the silver crusade had
arraigned father against son, and brother
against brother, and severed the ties of
love.
"Senator Hill, watching the strange
proceedings, bad to extend that brief po
litical code from which he has gained so
much renown. He felt compelled to say:
'I am a Democrat, but I am not a revolu
tionist'
"Senator Vest, realizing that they were
inaugurating a revolution, reminded tbe
convention that revolutions did not begin
with the rich and prosperous.
"Mr. Tillman felt that the change in
the management of public affairs was to
be so radical that he proposed sulphur
fumigation for the ship before the new
crew took possession of it."
M'KINLEY AND BIMETALLISM.
It is dishonest of the Bryamtea to
charge Major McKinley with being a gold
standard man, for they know they do not
tell the truth. There never was a time
when Major McKinley was not a bimet
allist. No one can point to a public utter
ance of Major McKinley that could be in
terpreted to mean that he was for a simple
gold standard monetary system, and wben
he is charged with being an enemy of
silver be is grossly and wickedly misrep
resented. In an addres9 in August, 1891,
Major McKinley said : "If we could have
an international ratio, which all the lead
ing nations of the world would adopt, and
the true relation be fixed between the two
meials, and all agree upon the quantity of
silver which should constitute a dollar,
then silver would be as free and unlimited
in its privileges of coinage as gold is to-day.
But that we have not been able to secure,
and with tbe free and unlimited coinage
of silver adopted in the United States at
the present ratio, we would be still further
removed from any international agree
ment. We may never be able to secure it
if we enter upon the isolated coinage of
silver. The double standard implies
equality at a ratio, and that equality can
only be established by the concurrent law
of nations. It was the concurrent law of
nations that made tbe gold standard; it
will require the concurrent law of nations
to reinstate and sustain it."
In his letter accepting the nomination
of the Republican party for President
Major McKinley says: "The Republican
party has not been and is not now opposed
to the use of silver money, as its record
abundantly shows. It has done all that
coula be done for its increased use, with
safety and honor, by the United States
acting apart from other Governments.
There are those who think that it has
already gone beyond the limit of financial
prudence. Surely we can go no further,
and we must not permit false lights to
lure us across the danger line.
"We have more silver in use than any
country in the world except India or
Chinaâ ssoo,ooo,ooo more than Great Brit
ain, $150,000,000 more t ban France, $400,
--000,000 more than Germany, $325,000,000
less than India and $125,000,000 less than
China. The Republican party has de
clared in favor of any international agree
ment, and if elected President it will be
my duty to employ all proper means to
promote it.
"It ia not proposed by the Republican
party to take from tbe circulating medium
of the country any of the silver we now
have. On the contrary, it is proposed to
keep all of the silver money now in circu
lation on a parity with gold by maintain
ing the pledge of the Government that all
of it shall be equal to gold.
"This has been the unbroken policy of
the Republican party since 1875. It has
inaugurates no new Dolicy. It will keep
in circulation and as good as gold all of
toe silver and paper money which, are now
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 1896.
included in the currency of the country.
It will maintain their parity. It will pre
serve their equality in the future as it has
always done in the oast."
If the above quotations from Major Mc-
Kinley's public utterances are not satisfy
ing then nothing that he could say would
satisfy, for words could not be employed
to show any clearer that he has been
a consistent bimetailist throughout hU
public career. But it is not the pnrpose
of the Bryanites to quote Major McKinley
correctly. They want to misrepresent
him and weaken him with wage-earners,
but labor knows where he stands. It
knows he wants the industries of the
country opened for the employment of
labor first, and the mints opened to silver
when labor begins to earn wages.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
Every day furnishes new evidences that
tbe men who are supporting Bryan in this
campaign are not seeking the remonetiza
tion of silver as a means of restoring bi
metallism, but for some other and far dif
ferent purpose. What that purpose is has
never been expressly stated, but it seems to
be the payment oi debts and wages in dol
lars having about half the purchasing
power of dollars on the present standard.
The fact that some such object is in view
is made evident by the refusal of the
Bryanites to accept a 9 satisfactory to them
any argument in favor of true bimetal
lism.
A sufficient illustration of this charac
teristic of the Bryan party is to be found
in the Examiner of yesterday in an edi
torial commenting upon the recent debate
on the money question by John P. Irish
and Edwin F. AdamÂ» before the Political
Economy Club of this City. The club is
not a political organization and party poli
tics has no part in its debates. Mr.
Adams.' argument was a scholarly, able
presentation of the defects of the single
gold standard as an equitable measure for
the settlement of deferred payments, and
in the opinion of all genuine bimetallists
amply justified the reputation Mr. Adams
enjoys as a writer and speaker on
economic topics and as the founder and
one of the managers of the Grange Sum
mer School of Economics at Camp Roache.
Moreover, it seemed to many, if not most,
who heard the discussion that Mr. Adams
had the best of the argument and thtt Mr.
Irish evaded rather than answered him.
Bimetallism baaed on sound economic
ground, however, is not favored by the
extremists, and accordingly we find the
Examiner declaring the debate to have
been "a political bunko game" and sug
gesting that it was arranged for the pur
pose of allowing the advocate of gold to
win a victory over "a dummy" champion
of silver. It asserted that Mr. Adams
had made himself "the tool of a shabby
political trick," and for half a column de
rided in cunning form of speech the whole
of thif discussion, arranged by one of the
most thoughtful and earnest clubs in the
City.
gmall as this incident is in itself it
serves as one of the illustrations of the
tendencies of those who are supporting
Bryan. To them a conservative, thoughtful,
fair-minded, studioxis bimetallist is more
objectionable than the advocate of the sin
gle gold standard. They care nothing for
bimetallism on economic grounds. Their
delight is in Bryan when he talks of cruci
lying mankind on the "cross of gold,"
or when, as at Erie on Thursday, he told
a mob, "The future is written in blood
crushed out of you by gold." Any man
who does not discuss the money question
in that lurid style is denounced aa an op
ponent of silver, though he may be among
the most earnest in seeking to restore it
to its proper place as money metal by en
lightened statesmanship.
Fortunately for the cause of good gov
ernment, 6ound business and genuine bi
metallism, evidences of the kind we have
pointed out are occurring so frequently
and so glaringly in all parts of the Union
that the people cannot fail to see what is
the purpose of those who are supporting
the Bryan ticket. It is not bimetallism
they are after. It is not the concurrent
use of gold and silver. It is not any mea
sure of conservative or constructive states
manship. It is not anything the intelli
gent student of finance, whether a banker
or a farmer, can support. It is something
that is to array one section of the Union
against another, one class of the people
against another; something that can be
advocated only by threats against capital
and by schemes that menace every indus
try of city or country.
THE WOOL INDUSTRY.

and the field, as well as those of the shop and
the factoryâ to hemp, to wool, the product of
the great industry % of sheep husbandry, as well
as to the finished woolens of the mill â we
promise the most ample protection.
Contrast this declaration of the Repub
lican platform with a speech delivered
upon the floor of Congress on the Wilson-
Gorman bill by W. J. Bryan, who said :
â¦'Speaking for myself, it is immaterial, in
my judgment, v/bether the sheep-grower
receives any banelit from the tariff or not.
Whether he does or does not, whether the
wool manufacturer collects a compensa
tory duty from the consumer of woolen
goods and pays it over to the wool-grower,
or collects it and keeps it himself, or
doesn't collect it at all and therefore does
not need it, I am for free wool."
On that occasion Mr. Bryan not only
objected to a tariff on wool, but he ob
jected to the Wilson-Gorman bill through
out, and said concerning it: "I think the
duties all the way through this bill are
higher than necessary, and I favor the
bill not because of its perfection, not be
cause the duties are brought down as low
as they might be, but because the bill is
infinitely better than the law which we
now have, and is a step in the right direc
tion."
Mr. Bryan can be relied upon from his
own testimony to fasten absolute free
trade upon the country if he is elected.
Why be should have so little interest in
the welfare of American labor, and why
he should want foreign pauper labor to
supply this country with all the manu
factured articles that are consumed by our
people is a mystery. Is W*. J. Bryan an
American at heart? It does not look so.
INCENDIARY SPEECHES.
It certainly is unfortunate for the peace
and dignity of the country that Mr. Bryan
should employ such incendiary speech.
The people do not want to hear anything
of the kind, and he mistakes their temper
very much if he thinks they do. There is
an element in every community that can
be relied upon to applaud any one who
makes a "spicy speech," but very many of
even that class would repudiate the
speaker if be were to ask them to commit
an overt act against law and order. Mr.
Bryan is a sensible man, or is supposed to
be, but he shows very little judgment in
framing sentences when on the busting.
At Erie, Pa., he told the people "not to
let the Republican party beguile you
about the future." "The future," he said,
'â¢is written in blood." "It is going to be
war, and if we lose this time we are going
right along and keep up (be war until we
win." In the same harangue he said, "It
is not for amusement that we are engaged
in this contest." It is not likely that very
many of our people will take the man seri
ously, but what will the people of other
countries think about i f ? It makes a
good deal of difference to us what they
think. Our trade relations with other
countries ana the thousands of millions of
foreign money that is invested in Ameri
can industries and securities makes it
highly important that we do nothing to
cast a suspicion upon our business integ
rity. As a cold-biooded business proposi
tion, based upon our own greed and self
ishness, it is to our inteiest to do nothing
that would create a donbt concerning the
stability of our institutions and the hon
esty of our purpose to keep our business
engagements.
As we have said, Mr. Bryan cannot pro
voke the people of the United States to
make war upon one another, but the moral
influence his wild and foolish threats
exert is altogether bad; besides, they
create a degree of restlessness in the minds
oi the people that is well calculated to
seriously binder all commercial operations
and make people lose respect for them
selves. Of course Bryan does not want a
war of classes, and he knows that he is
talking through his hat, so to speak, when
he warns his hearers that "it is gome to
war," but he knows, too, tnat he is light
ing tbe fires of hatred and sectionalism,
and that if he keeps it up long enough he
wi" at least cause a great deal of rioting.
It is time Mr. Bryan was thinking of
himself as something other than a divinely
appointed agent to overturn the world.
He should try and maice himself under
stand tnat he is an accidental candidate
of the Democratic party for President,
without the ghost of a chance to be elected.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
To-morrow'g edition of Thb Call will
contain many interesting and novel fea
tures in the way of reading matter and il
lustrations, aside from the regular daily
record of all the news of the City, State,
Nation and world. Most of the special
features will treat of California or San
Francisco topics aud men, and all will at
least be written by the men and women of
this State. The Call is pre-eminently
the I'acitic Coast newspaper, and prides
itself upon being not only a great news
paper, but the family newspaper 01 the
coast. While its features are attractive
and full of human interest they are yet
clean and wholesome, and there is also â
particularly in the Sunday edition â a
large profusion of what may fittingly be
styled the better class of literature. Good
literature is not necessarily dull reading,
as The Sunday Call readers know full
well. This will be found especially true
of the coming issue, as a glance at but a
partial list of the contents will show:
Some pictures of the Bolters of San
Francisco, every one of which you will be
sure to recognize.

LADY'S BICYCLE COSTUME.
The most appropriate suit for bicycling,
which is at the same time comfortable and
not conspicuous, is shown here. It consists of
knickerbockers, with which leggings should
be worn, a skirt to the shoe tops, and a Nor
folk jacket. The skirt is gored aud sufficiently
wide not tooling ungracefully.
Materials of wool only should be used. Dust
color or dull tans are found most serviceable.
The entire costume may be made of one fabric,
or if that is too heavy, the knickerbockers
may be made of satin or satinp. The leggings
maybe of leather, but if made to match the
skirt are less conspicuous.
A binding or facing of leather on the skirt is
to be recommended, as it keeps it from cling
ing to the figure and maxes it leas likely to get
caught in the wheel.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
FOR BETTER TIMES.
THAT 18 THK CKY OF THOSE WHO RALLY AROUND
BRYAN'S STANDARD.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sin:
Four years ago the Populists were called
"calamity howlers" because they said the
times were Dad : all parties now agree that
times are bad, and especially our Republican
orators, notably those who depicted our condi
tion as a Nation at the St. Louis Republican
convention. But times were bad enough four
years ago to induce the people to turn down
McKinley, Harrison and the Republican party
and install Cleveland and a Democratic Con
gress to sustain him, that we might have
better times. Then the hard times were
laid to the McKinley tariff and the people
voted to have the tariff reduced by the
Democracy; but it was not done till after Con
gress in extra session had repealed tlie silver (
law which added fifty millions a year to the
amount of money in circulation, both Repub
licans and Democrats voting toaether, led by
John Sherman, to repeal v. H"as the reader
forgotten the reasons given by these Repub
licans and Democrats for sto aping the coinage
of sMver? Was it not, as they claimed, tne
first and necessary step to prosperity and to
keep the gold at home? Look up the old
speeches and see. Well, the law was repealed
and they stopped coining silver. But what
happened? Did Sherman's predictions of pros
perity come true? Did gold stay at home?
But the issue four years ago between the
Republicans and Democrats was the tariff,
and the people voted McKinley and his tariff
and his party out of rower because they
thought his tariff too high and voted to have
it reduced, and returned the Democrats to
power in order to get it reduced, and it was
reduced, but not so very much. How much â
rather how little? Reader, dear reader, do
you know? Can you find out? If so, how?
Who wiil tell you? Has any Republican
speaker told yon that the McKinley tariff was
based on a scale of 48.00 per cent and the
Wilson-Gorman tariff is 41.75, or only 6.91 per
cent less? As "the tariff is a tax," how
much has it reduced your taxes? Is any busi
ness better for it except that of loaning
money? Has the tariff, as a matter of fact,
judging by your own personal experience,
anything tangible to do with present condi
tions? You were taxed too much under the
McKinley oill, as you thought, or as a majority
thought, including a good many thousands of
Republicans, enough of them Uf turn the gov
ernment over to tne Democrats, aud so it was
determined to reduce the tariff, and now, after
it was reduced a very little, and as times got
worse a great many people who have not yet
learned to mink, and investigate for them
selves are inclined to go back to McKinley
and his tariff, hoping that times will at least
be as good as before his bill was repealed. Let
me write down here that they will be disap
pointed, again, and as an old - time Lin
coln Republican 1 think I can tell them
why. Let me first appeal to the intel
ligence of my reader ana ask if he
knows that during tbe last four months
of Harrison's administration even the Mc-
Kinley tariff fell short a million a month of
paying Government expenses? And why so?
ilcKiniey's letter of acceptance quotes from
Harrison's last message to Congress to show
that great industrial developments, were made
under his administration, as a broad hint to
the American people that he should have been
re-elected. He said:
"The new industrial plants established Octo
ber 0, 1890, and up to October â¢!â¢!, ltfyj, num
ber 345, and the extension of existing plants
108. The capital invested amounts to Â£40,
--440,070, and tbe number of additional em
ployes 37,285. 1 Miring tbe first six months of the
present calendar yenr 135 new factories were
Duilt, oi which forty were cotton-mills, forty
eight knitting-mills, twenty-six woolen-mills,
til' tee u silkruiils, four plushmills and two
linen-mills. Of the iorty-t\vo mills twenty
one have been built in the Southern States."
Now any reader of ordinary intelligence
knows tnat the more we manufacture at home
the less we import trom Europe, and hence the
less revenue from tariff, li is oniy a few years
since we imported shiploads of rails lor our
railroads, and we import none now. Raising
the tariff will not raise the revenue; it will
then become prohibitive. An income tax and
an inheritance tax such as they have in Eng
land will raise enough to supplement the tail
ing revenues from imports aud will fall alone
on those who are best able to pay it and have
most need of government to protect their
great properties.
What the country needs to restore prosperity
is more money, and as the first means to that
end we must restore silver to free coinage.
But says General Harrison in his great speech
in New York yesterday, >l that will drive all
the gold out of the country" and reduce the
money we have by one-naif. That is an old
cry long since discredited by the Sherman
law, anu it did not have that effect during the
eighty -three years ia which we had free coin
age, and was not doing it in 1873 when silver
was demonetized, and there had never been
any "dump" of silver during that period of
nearly a century. But let us admit that all
the gold will go abroad as it did during
the war, for gold is a coward and always
deserts the country in time of need; is there
one reader oi Ihe Call who does not know
that the Government will immediately issue a
patriotic paper money and back it by the same
authority and power which defends the flag?
But what will tbe gold men do with their gold
abroad? Where can they invest it to a belter
advantage than ia the United States? It is an
empty threat that gold will leave the country.
But ii it goes the country will not suffer as it
does now under the rule of gold. Bryan's sup
porters want more money and better times,
and they know how to secure what they want.

Mexican dollars are quoted daily in Saa

they were down to 47 cents. The American
dollar is worth 100 cents to-day and was worth
it two years ago. It does not fluctuate, be
cause it'passes and is kept as the equal of the
sold dollar. It holds that value in Mexico as
against the dollar of that country, and yet the
Mexican dollar contains more silver.

GOVERNOB ROMUALDO PACHECO
Branches of the League Are to Be
Established in Every County
in the State.
One of the leading and most important
political organizations in this City is the
Spanish-American Republican League of
California, of which R. R. Duckworth is
president and A. de la Torre Jr. is secre
tary.
About two months ago some of the lead
in? Spanish-Americans of this City held a
! meeting in Judge Groezinger's courtroom
for tne purpose of organization. The
Spanish-American voters of this City have
\ not taken an active part in politics in the
i past, but from the large number that have
j enrolled since the organization of the
R. R. DUCKWORTH, President of the Spanish-American
Republican League.
league they will prove a leading factor in
the politics of the City and County o? San
Francisco. They have organized a drill
corps, of which A. de la Torre has
been elected captain. Mr. de la Torre
has for many years been an officer
of the Juarez Guard, a local mili
tary company. A drum corps com
posed of members from the club will also
be one of the features of the organiza
tion. Governor R. Pacheco is an active
member, and as he is a great favorite with
the Spanish-Americans of this State he
will do much to make the Spanish-Ameri
can League a power for McKinley and
Hobart.
Among some of the leading members
who are taking an active part are Hon.
Valentine Alviso, E. Moreno, Profess-or
R. A. Martinez, D. Espinosa, Professor
Mojica and many others. The league has
engaged California Hall, on Bush street,
as their meeting headquarters and from
this on will take an active part, making
the drill corps one of the features of the
campaign.
The league made a wise selection in R.
A. DE LA TORRE JR., Captain and Secretary of the
Spanish-American Republican League.
R. Duckworth for president. Mr. Duck
worth is a young man and was born and
raised in Monterey County, where for
many years he took ?.n active parCin Re
publican politics. He came to this City
about five years ago to accept a position in
the United Statf-s Mint, where he remained
during Harrison's administration.
He was connected with the admission
department during the life of the Mid
winter Fair, and in every position he held
lie has proved his ability.
Since coming to this City he has taken
an active part in every campaign, and he
is recognized as a leader among the young
element of the Republican party. It is
his ambition to have a branch of the
league in every county in this State, and
under bis leadership it is safe to say that

BUCKMAN'S CAMP MAY GO.
An Agreement Made With the Health
Officer to That Effect.
The removal of Buckman's camp was
vigorously discussed last evening at a
meeting in the grammar school, in tbe
vicinity of the camp, by the members of
the local improvement club. E, C. Priber
presided and Charles 8. Perkins was
secretary. One of the first acts of the
meeting was to extend a vote of thanks to
the Board of Education for tendering the
use of the schoolhouse for the meeting.
Frank Bragg reported that a large number
of names bad been enrolled in the club
membership. W. L. Williamson, chair
man of the committee to interview the
Health Officer, reported that a determined
stand had been taken for the removal of
the camp.
After the interview with the Health
Officer Mr. Williamson went around the
neighborhood and in a radius of eight
blocks counted 281 vacant houses. Thi3
he attributed to the camp, for on Golden
Gate avenue, which is out of the camp
district, he found only eighty -one vacant
houses in a corresponding area. J. P.
Dockery, Milk Inspector, addressed the
meeting and promised to do what hecould
to lead to the removal of the camp.
A. Hochstein reported that the German
Savings Bank owns the site of the
camp, and tbat the bank had ordered the
removal of the camp. Vice- President
Hugh Keenan bad the report of the even-
l ing, for he said that he had seen the
Health Officer and that Mr. Buckman has
executed an agreement with tbat officer,
under bond and foifeit, to remove within
thirty day?. Mr. Abbott reported that he
had visited the camp and that he bad
found it in very bad condition. The prob
{ ability is tbat tne camp will soon move,
under the agreement reached with the
Health Officer.

Tramp steamers are running the sailing
vessels out of the carrying business. The
latter are tied up, awaiting charters, in
every port in the world, while the tramp
makes time and money for her owners.
The East Indian trade, the commerce of
Australasia and the grain of California is
now carried by the steam tramps, and it
looks as though the final disappearance of
the "wind-jammer" had come.
At the present time the British tramp
steamer Cedar Branch is loading barley at
Long Bridge, and the Stmthgarry wheat
at McNear's, while the Annandale, Cap
tain Mine, arrived last Thursday uight
from Tacoma; the Aggi, CaDtain Hatte
burg, yesterday from Nagasaki, via Vic
toria, B. C, and the Lonjtships, Captain
Millons, from Yokohama. All three ves
sel? came here in ballast and are under
I charter to carry grain to Europe. In the
I meantime the disengaped tonnage in port
I is 29,174, or nearly three times as much as
lit was in 1895 at this time. Nearly ali the
vessels are under the British flag, ancf* the
majority of them aie now at anchor in
Mission Bay or at Sausalito.
The "tramp" is not a friend of the
"tug," and in consequence the two are
always at war. So far the "tramp" has
the most points to its credit, and many
"tugs" are idle in consequence. Two of
the most powerful tugs in the world are
the Retriever and Rescue, employed on
i the Hoogley River. Since tue "tramps"
have pone into the Indian trade the sail
ing vessels have withdrawn, and the tow
boat business has fallen away. Both the
tugs named are for sale, and the "tramp"
reigns supreme in the Orient.
The tug Vigilant will make an excursion
to the FaralTones and Cordell Bank* next
Bunduy morning. Captain Clem Randall
will be in command of the steamer, and
his youngest brother will have charge of
the party. The start will be made from
Folsoin -street wharf at 1 A. m.. and, as the
moon will be in its last quarter, the catch
of fish should be a good one. Over sixty
passengers are expected to go out on the
tug, and Captain Randall asserts that all
will nave a good time.
The United States gunboat Bennington
started for Port Los Angeles yesterday at
11 a. m. At that place she will join the
Philadelphia, Monadnock ana Monterey,
in order to take part in the annual target
practice. After the exercises the vessels
will return to San Francisco.
For a month past youngsters have been
robbing vessels that have happened to
dock north of Market street, xesterday
little Willie Pliillips, who lives at 222
Broadway, was turned over to Captain
Dunleavy by his father, and as he proves
to be one of the ringleaders of the gang,
he will be sent to Whittier. He has given
the names of the other boys who assisted
him in his depredations, and the other
members of the gang will be arrested to
day.
The tug Fearless did considerable dam
age to the gasoline schooner Newark
yesterday. The tug was entering the alip
between Mission 2 and Howard 2 when
she ran into the schooner and car
ried away the latter'a mainmast and main
boom.
The mast was snapped in two places
and the schooner was otherwise damaged.
The Newark was from Bowens Landing,
and while awaiting a berth the captain
tied up alongside the foot of Mission
street. Captain Dan Haskell of the Fear
less was attempting to enter the slip in
order *o secure the Cedarbank and to.v
her to Port Costa to load wheat. While
making his landing the tug ran into the
schooner and did the damage mtntioned.
Chief Engineer Holmes of the Harbor
Commission has been reappoin ted by the
members of the board. He has all the
worlf of the new ferry depot at his fingers'
ends, and the Commissioners were anxious
to hold him in his position until the work
is finished.
The steamer Australia will sail for Hon
olulu to-day and the Zeaiandia will take
her place at tne wharf. The latter has
just completed a run to Central America
for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
but as the corporation has nowanurrber
cf spare boats the Zeaiandia will be re
turned to the John D. Spreckels & Bros.
Company and the old schedule will be re
sumed on the mail company's route. The
Zealand,ia will be overhauled and aent to
Martinez, where she may lie at ancnor for
another six months.
J. Sennett of the Golden Shore Market
had a narrow escape last Friday morning.
I His boat capsized outside the heads and
i lor twelve hours he drifted around at the
mercy of the wind and waves. He saw
three tramp steamers pass iD, but could
attract no one's attention. Finally he
was picked up by one of the pilot- boats
and broueht into port. Sennett was
picked up only just in time, as a few min
utes after he was in the pilot-boat's dingy
his Whitehall sank.
OCEAN VIEW ROUSED.
Residents Protect Against Supposed Mis
representation and Corporation Rule.
Recent published accounts of malaria
and other undesirable things at Ocean
View have caused some of the most prom
inent residents of that suburb to protest
against what they consider misrepresenta
tion. Among others William N. Cook, A.
Haring and George R. Moore have taken
the matter deeply to heart. In a commu
nication to The Call they thus detail
some of 'heir grievances :
Are the people of Ocean View to be taxed for
the purpose of protecting the property of a
monopolistic corporation like the Spring Val
ley Water Company, even it it were true that
the refuse from the dwellings, stables, etc., of
this portion of the City finds its way into Lake
Merced, which it does not? Is it not a fact
that ioug before the Spring Valley Water Com
pany owned Lake Merced ranch, and at the
time Mahoney wanted to sell the property to
the City for the City's water supply, that com
pany denounced the waters of the lake as
unfit for household purposes on account of its
being brackish (mixeawith sea water), but di
rectly after the Spring Valley Company had
taken the property off the hands ol the Hiber
nia Bank tbe water was found to be exoellent?
The cattle and dairy ranches of San Mateo
County in the immediate neighborhood are
j the principal source from which Lake Merced
I receives its objectionable drainage.
If any people are to be taxed for the tunnel
which tne water company is bnilding, it
shonid be those residing in San Mateo County,
and not the poor inhabitants of Ocean View.
The lake is too remote to receive any of the
sewage, and the company itself did not ,
think of contaminating environments when it
rented the lake's contiguous lands to Bill Hall
for pasturing his thousands of cattle.
Through Islais Creek and into the bay is the
natural drainaee outlet for this portion of the
City, when sufficiently populated, and not
into the ocean by way of Lake Merced. It is
the duty of the Spring Valley Water Company
to protect its source of, supply, instead of its
endeavoring to tax the'people -of this section
j $40,000 to $50,000 for the purpose of con
i structing an outlet udoii the company's land.
But this is not all. There is to be run a
I central sewer of about half a mile in length,
1 the cost of which they wisely do not state, and
I without the cross-street sewer-pipes and their
I connection with the dwellings the outlay for
! central and main sewers would be thrown
â¢ away and benefit only the Spring Valley Water
I Company and the contractors. Then the grad
\ ing and macadamizing, according to the offer
â  of one of the pubiic-splrited friends of the
I property-owners, would be 70 cents per front
I toot, or"sl7 50 per lot, making for the whole of
I Ocean View the snug sum of $88,000, exclu
j sive of the Sf wer-laying, while the streets
I around the Masonic Cemetery were macadam
ized for 40 cents a front foot.
But would tliis enormous outlay prevent the
' contamination of Luke Merced? Certainly
not. The racetrack, with its great numbe.- Â1
! horses and their attendants aud the multitude
j of people congregating there daily, does more
I harm to the lake waters than the inhabitants
of Ocean View could do in decades to come.

FLYING-MACHINES
MAY HAVE A RACE
Odd Tourney Suggested for
the Mechanics'
Fair.
PRIZE FOR A WINNER.
Chairman Doolan of the Enter
tainment Committee Is
Interested.
WOULD BE A DRAWING CARD-
Mr. Erickson of Oakland Invites Mayor
Sutro and Mayor Davie to
Fly With H.m.
It is barely possible that a competition
between tiying-machines may be made
one of the features of the Mechanics' In
stitute Fair. Chairman Doolan of the en
tertainment committee has corresponded
with inventors ot aeroplanes and flying
machines, and last evening Mr. Doolan
said:
"There has been a great deal of talk re
cently about flying-machines, and you
would be surprised if you could learn the
amount of interest which propositions to
navigate or fly tnroi'gh the air Lave called
into existence. A proposition has been
made by Charles Erickson of Oakland to
fly from the Mechanics' Pavilion to the
State Capitol at Sacramento during the
progress of the fair. Now, in my opinion,
it would be better, if Mr. Erickson desires
to give an exhibition of his machine by a
long-distance fly to Sacramento, that the
test should take place toward the end of
the season, which would permit the enter
tai nment committee, possibly, to get other
flying-machines here and so institute a
competition which would prove a draw
ing card if thu- tests were attended with
any degree of success.
"Not little scientific interest would at
tach to such an exhibition. If it succeed
ed the name of the Mechanics' Institute
would be coupled with it. Ido not know
what any of tnese inventions can perform.
There are possibly three sorts of ma
chines that might be entered. The first is
Mr. Erickson's. Possibly Dr. Smith, who
has an aluminum cylinder deyice may
compete, and then there is Professor
Langley of the Smithsonian Institution at
Washington. Dr. Smith tells me that he
saw Professor Langley fly half a mile re
cently. Part of the aim of the Mechanics'
Institute is to encourage inventions. I
think that we could afford to offer quite a
large prize, perhaps as much as $1000, for
the successful competition in a flying
match, under certain conditions to be
specified."
Carl Erickson of Oakland has invited
Mayor Sutro to go with him in his air
ship Christopher Columbus on the after
noon of September 1, when he "will at
tempt to saii from the roof of the Mechan
ics' Pavilion to the dome of the State Cap
itol at Sacramento. In his invitation to
Mayor Sutro Mr. Erickson reassuringly
says: "Do not be alarmed in the least, as
1 guarantee a safe trip. I have asked
Mayor Davie of Oakland to accompany us.
I trust I may have ycur presence at an
event which will go down into history as
one of the greatest achieved wonders of
the nineteenth century." Whether Mavor
Sutro and Mayor Davie will make a flight
â¢â¢ltti Mr. Erickson from the Mechanics'
Pavilion roof tne officers of the Mechanics'
Institute do not know. There is- no doubt
that the presence of the two Mayors of
the bay cities wonid lend distinction and
enhance the value of the drawing card.
Little is known about Mr. Erickson's ap
paratus. The tone of his letter to Mayor
Sutro indicates that at least he has confi
dence in his invention in its practical ap
plication.
Dr. Smith of this City, who has an in
vention which has already been described
in The Call, said Jast evening that he
would not be able to have his apparatus
ready for competition during the fair sea
son. He will enter a model in the fair,
which will be on exhibition. He will not
be able to get aluminum enough to make
a machine for an out of door test in the
time allotted. The aluminum has to be
brought from Pittsburg and it is very
difficult to procure much. As a matter of
fact, when he was making his model he
was unable to get the aluminum he
needed, and consequently the gas cylinder
wnich will lift his apparatus had to be
made of zinc, which is heavy.
The exhibition of Professor Laneley's
flyinc-machine, which Dr. Smith wit
nessed, took place a few Sundays ago on
the Potomoc River, a few miles below
Washington, D. C. Dr. Smith went with
Professor Langley at the invitation of the
latter. They took a scow and dropped
down the river some distance, and then
Professor Langley flew with his machine.
First he rose about 75 feet and then he
sailed off against the wind and came
down when he wished into the river.
Professor Langley's apparatus consists of
a propeller, which he treads with his feet,
and the motion of the propellor shoved
him*ap against the wind. Dr. Smith ex
pressed doubt whether Professor Lang
ley's contrivance would do so well going
with the wind, the tendency of coinciding

THEIR SLOGAN
STILL SOUNDS,
Wheelmen Rejoice Over
the Backdown of the
* Southern Pacific.
THE BATTLE STILL ON.
Will Not Rest Till Bicycles as
Baggage Becomes a
State Law.
COLONEL CKOCKEE DID IT.
Candidates for the Assemb'y Already
Bjgin to Court the Many
Wheelmen.
Freedom for wheelmen of this section of
the State was officially proclaimed yester
day by the Southern Pacific in accordance
with the announcement made by The
Call yesterday.
To many of tne cyclists the news as pub
lished in Ihi Call appeared to be too good
to be true, coming as it did so soon after
tde opening of the campaign in opposition
to the proposed course of the railroad, but
when its full import was fairly realized
there was joy and jubilation at the head
quarters oi every club and wherever
wheelmen are in the habit of gathering.
From the office of General Passenger
Agent T. H. Goodman instructions were
sent out yesterday to every railroad agent
in the territory between San Francisco,
San Jose, Yallejo, Martinez and Benicia
informing them that the order imposing
a charge on the carriage of bicycles was
canceled and that bicycles were to be
transported between the points named
free oi charge as heretofore.
Wheelmen owe their thanks to Colonel
Charles if. Crocker for the ..withdrawal of
the obnoxious order. There was long and
interesting discussion in his office on
Wednesday. In the course of this Traffic
Manager J. C. Stubbs argued in favor of
the order beins; made effective, on the
ground tnat the Southern Pacific Com
pany, as a member of various railroad as
sociations, owed it to the other members
of these associations, and to consistency,
to impose a charge on the transportation
of wheels everywhere within the State.
He referred to the fact that all other roads
are making such charges, and argued that
there was nothing unfair nor unjust in
such a cour-e.
Colonel Crocker listened patiently, and
then spoKe of the feeling that had already
been aroused and snowed his inclinations
generally to be in favor of the abrogation
of ;he order under consideration.
The conference ended without any de
cision having been reached. Late Thurs
day afternoon Colonel Crocker had an
other short consultation with Mr. Stubbs,
and the outcome was the determination to
recall the objectionable order from motives
of policy as well as of profit. But this de
cisive victory has but whettea the appetite
of the wheelmen for war, and it will be
waged unceasingly and unrelentingly un
til the day the ballots are cast in the No
vember election. It is the confident hope
of the wheelmen that on that day will be
elected oniy such members oi tbe Legis
lature as have pledged themselves to tne
wneelmen's cause. Bicycles as baggage,
and good roads, will be their slogan dur
ine the campaign.
Where the day before Traffic Manager
Stubbs of the Southern Pacific Railroad
was the Banquo's ghost which would not
down, yesterday the wheelmen, subse
quent to the announcement in The Call
that the order fixing a charge for the
transportation of bicycles would be re
scinded, would have extended the traffic
manager the giad und apologetic band if
they bad collided with him on the street.
but though the late order, which created
jo mucn commotion, is off, the agitation
lor an Armstrong bill will not die. Wheel
men said yesterday that it will be con
tinued and carried with a whoop into Sac
ramento next fail. The agitation has
gone too far to be stopped. The wheel
men of the State will see that it gathers
strength steadily till election day.
Would-be candidates for the Legisla
ture do not underrate the strength of the
wheelmen in San Francisco. Many of
them have sought out leading local wheel
men, stated that they are in favor of an
Armstrong bill, and expressed a willing
ness and desire to meet- the executive
committee of the Wheelmen's Municipal
Leaeue. The executive committee will
meet candidates. . The battle is not yet
over. The wheelmen ~i!l not be caught
napping.
"I am so glad Mr. Stubbs has rescinded
the order, and now we won't have any
more trouble about it," said Miss Mamie
Â£. McCarthy, president of the Alpha
Cycling Club, who is a clerk in the office
of R. G. Dun & Co. "I was surprised when
I read it in The Call this morning, and
now we won't have to hold an indignation
meeting. They charged me fifty pounds
baggage {gf my wheel several weeks ago
in Southern California. Ido npt think
that was fair. I have taken my wheel out
of the car with the tire punctured and
collapsed. They stuck pins in it. How
do I know it was a pin? Well, don't 1
know a pin-hole when I see it! The holes
were too small to be made by anything
else. Ido not know who did it, but it
couldn't have been done except throuen
meanness. From wnat other motive would
any one stick pins in a tire? 1 think the
hoys bad better keep up the agitation
though till we get an Armstrong law
through the Legislature, and then we will
be on the safe side."
AJlen Jones, a local racer of prominence
in the employ of T. H. B. Varney, said:
"The Call did it and I am glad of it. I
aid not think the charge would create
such a breeze. All the wheelmen whom I
have berrd speak about it are delighted.
The rescinding of ttie order may be a
scheme to throw us off the tract until
after election and it may be permanent;
but we can't tell. Therefore tue wisest
thing to do is to have an Armstrong bill
passed by the Legislature anyhow, ana
then we shall be on the safe side. If we
don't get the bill passed this winter we
can't do a thing for two or three years.
The L. A. W. and the Wheelmen's Muni
cipal League should keep right on work
ing up the Armstrong bill."
"I was surprised to read in The Call
that the order would be rescinded," said
J. S. Con well, president of the Cycle Board
of Trade. "We owe it to tne newspapers,
and The Call in particular. It is a great
victory. I think the Southern Pacific will
lose nothing dv it. They will gain in
good will if in nothing else. But an Arm
strong bill should be passed notwithstand
ing the rescinding order. We had a cer
tain free zone oi twenty- five or thirty
miles before, but as far away as San Jose
and Santa Crut we had to pay for wheels.
The free zone should include the entire
State. If you put a bicycle in a trunk and
lock it up the company carries it and
handles it as baggage, but for the naked
wheel they charge. If a man has two
pieces of baggage, both inside tne limit
weight for baggage, why should one piece
be inclosed in another?
"In New York the railroads have hooks
in the top of the baggage-cars, on which
wheels are hung by the frames with saiety
to the wheels and without inconvenience.
1 say, keep up the fight for an Armstrong
Dill. Certain railroads running out of
Chicago are bidding for the trade of cy
clists. Candidates for the Assembly want
to meet us. I have beard from several of
them. The aqtual voting strength of
wheelmen in San Francisco is 7000. In
addition to these every wheelman has a
friend, almost without exception, to whom
he loans or rents his wheel for occasional
trips, and all of these riders are for good
roads and free transportation of wheels as
baggage and are entirely in sympathy with
us. Anybody who has ridden down Mar
ket street and had his teeth nearly jarred
out is in sympathy with us."
President C. E. Adams of the Olympic
Bicycle Club says be does not understand
why the Southern Pacific with the knowl
edge its officials must have had that wheel
men were alive in the interest of an Arm
strong bill in this State, and in the face of
the organization of a Wheelmen's Muni
cipal League.should have imposed a charge
on bicycles. "We are all pleased," he
said, "that the order is to be rescinded. I
say Keep up the agitation till a law simi
lar to the Armstrong bill is passed by our
Legislature. Ido not want to suspect the
Southern Pacific of any ulterior motive in
rescinding the order, but that would be
the best course to pursue. But it is as
Mr. Stubbs saysâ they have furnished us
with accommodations sometimes when we
have asked for them. However, I do not
see that bicycles are any harder to bandl?
or more undesirable to handle than milk
cans which the company carries on its
passenger trains and which frequently
delay the train in the handling. lam not
in favor of wheelmen entering politics as
a political organization with candidates of
their Own for various offices, but let them
rally to the protection of their own in
terests. Developments have shown the
wheelmen that they have political
strength. >r
Bicyclists on the wing on Golden Gate
avenue last evening paused to express
their gratification at the retreat of the
Southern Pacific Railroad from its impo
sition of the charge for the transportation
of wheels on ferries and trains. A group
of cyclers of both sexes expressed almost
I in chorus very candid opinions of the
order, and their joy at its withdrawal.
J. F. Morris, past president of the San
Francisco Road Club, was encountered as
he was coming out of that club with his
wheel. He said : "We naturally feel much
elated at the rescinding of the order.
However, we shall keep *ap the battle for
the passage of a bill by the Legislature
i classing bicycles as baggage and requiring
jail railroads in the State to cat ry them
free as baggage. We alpo want better
streets and roads. We will not attempt
to interfere in the nomination of a Street
Commissioner, but we will support only
the Street Commissioner who will give us
improved streets. lam in favor of Keep
i me at it till an Armstrong bill is passed."
Harry Larkin. secretary of the Bay City
; Wheelmen, expressed original and some
; what divergent views. He said: "Many
members of our club did not look upon
the 10-cent charge for carrying wheels on
i the ferries with so much disfavor as some
'of the other wheelmen. We thought it
would have a tendency to keep off the
the boats the hoodlum element among
| wheelmen, who often make things so dis
agreeable on the boats. The members of
i this club will take no active political part
iin the campaign. The L. A. W. does that
| sort of business. This is aL. A. W. club,
I and we will stand behind the L. A. W. If
this club had among its members a candi
date for office we would get out and work
for him. But it's the L. A. W.s duty to
look after politics. Our members favorrhe
passage of an Armstrong bill, but vre are
not going actively into politics."
ON THE OTHER SHORE.
Oakland Cyclers Indignant at the
Order and Glad It Was
Rescinded.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 26.â The order
of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
to charge for bicycles caused a storm of in
dignation here, and the news that it had
been rescinded was received with expres
sions of gratification.
Mayor Davie said: "The effort of the
Southern Pacific Company to charge for
carrying bicycles in this vicinity is fully in
accord with its well-known poJicy to get
'all the traffic will bear.' The officials of
the company seem to think that every one
should contribute to its coffers for dar
ing to breathe, out the efforts of The Call
in aiding the bicyclists to make their li^hi
ha 3 shown the company that there are
others besides themselves in this State.
Nothing should be Wt t 'one to get the
next Legislature t c law requiring
all railroad compa; ".arry wheels as
baggage free of char^
Councilman Basseti â¢ x.ie effort of the
railroad to cinch bicycle riders by charg
ing t .em transportation for their wheels
is an outrage and a disgrace. Every man
should arise in his indignation and force
this question to a final settlement. Not
only should wheels be carried free about
the' bay when the rider pays his fare, but
that privilege should extend to all parts of
the State.
"The backdown by the withdrawal of the
obnoxious order shows that they have
little faith in the effort to bleed patrons
for every cent within reach. It may not
be, but it looks very mucn as if the com
cany wanted to get even for the loss of
carfare."
Captain Harry Williams of the Oakland
Cycling Club: "It was small business for
; the railroad to attempt to force bicycle
I riders to pay for taking their wheels
i across the ferry. They occupy very little
room, and are not bandied by the com
pany's employes at all. Even the matter
of charging anywhere in the State is un
| just, as a patron of the road has the right
i to a certain amount of baggage, and no
one has a right to dictate in What shape it
shall be any more than they have as to
what it shalt.be. All riders and lnends of
riders should unite in forcing the com
pany to remove all restrictions regarding
the transportation of bicycles."
President George F. Neese of the Acme
Athletic Club: "Our boys are a unit in
! declaring the attempt to collect on wheels
taken across the bay an outrage, and
would refuse to make any club runs to San
Francisco or go anywhere and take their
wheels as long as the rule was enforced.
The company would then not only lose its
anticipated revenue, but also that which
it is now assured. I believe they saw this,
and revoked the order, as announced in
Thk Call to-day. Cyciers are a power
now, because they are united, and will
stand for their rights regardless of party."
None of the officers of the Reliance Ath
letic Club could be found to-night, but a
prominent member said: "The boys all
declare it a rank outrage for the railroad
i to attempt to charge for carrying wheels
in the territory about tne bay and would
do anytnine necessary to resent the act.
If it becomes necessary they will call an
I indignation meeting and express their
| sentiments in no uncertain manner. But
we believe the company has seen the error
of its way and recindeo the order before
it went into effect as a matter of justice to
their best patrons. If they had not it
would have resulted in a heavy less of
traffic, as all runs would have been made
on this side."
Members of the Oakland Y. M. C. A.
Cycling Club have discussed the new
order and felt greatly aggrieved, as they
have interclub runs with the San Fran
cisco boys once a month. The news in
Thk Call to-day was received with many
words of pleasure. They now feel that all
danger in' that line is not yet past.

VESTED RIGHTS
OF PROPERTY.
Arguments in the Spreckels
Case in the Supreme
Court.
AN INTERESTING POINT.
D. M. Delmas on the Responsi
bility Regarding Community
Estates.
ELEMENTS OF A TRANSFER.
Husbands May Not Disburse Com*
mon Earnings at
Will.
The case of Spreckels vs. Spreckels came
before the Supreme Court on argument
yesterday morning. Henry Ach for the
respondents and D. M. Delmas for the ap
pellants were the only speakers, but they
went over the case so thoroughly there
was nothing left to be said when court ad
journed.
The case is before the Supreme Court on
an appeal by Claus Spreckels from an ad
verse judgment by Judge Slack, in
his suit to recover possession of 5000
shares of stock delivered to the de
fendant, Rudolph Spreckels. It was
contended by the plaintiffs that the trans
fer of stock was invalid because it was
done in violation of the law requiring the
consent of the wife to all transfers of com
munity property. The defendants claimed
that the law making such requirement
was unconstitutional, as interfering with
one of the vested rights of the husband.
Mr. Delmas' argument before the Supreme
Court was along the line of that conten
tion. In brief he said:
On the 31st of March, 1891, the Legislature
of this State adopted airfTmendment to the laws
regulating the rights of husband and wife in
the community of the marriage, by which the
absolute right of disposition which had been
theretofore granted as early as the statutes of
1850, and had been perpetuated by the codes,
was modified to the extent of requiring to the
validity of any gift of the community prop
erty the written consent of the wife. That
amendment, wnen added to the statute as it
then existed, would make section 172 oi the
Civil Code read as follows:
The husband has the management and control
, of the community property, with the like absolute
Sower of disposition other than testamentary as
c lias of bis separate estate, provided, how
ever, that he cannot inane a gift of such commu
nity property without a valuable consideration
unless the wife In wilting consents thereto.
The only question presented by the record
which is now before your Honors on this ap
peal to which I desire, for the present, at
least, to address myselt, is the question de
cided by the court below relating to the con
stitutionality of this statute. To state in their
broadest terms and most general comprehen
siveness the facts upon which that contention
was made and decided, I would state them as
follow?:
The husband and wife were married before the
adoption of this amendment, and before the
adoption of the amendment had acquired the
community property under discussiou. After
the amendment the husband undertook with
out the consent of his wife to make a gift of
the community property thus acquired, and
the question presented upon those facts is
this, Is that gift valid? It was held by the
court below that the gift was valid because the
amendment, in so far as it undertook to oper
ate upon the community property acquired
before the amendment, was unconstitutional.
The broad ground upon which that decision
la placed, as we understand it, is that under
the laws as they existed before that amend
ment, the husband was the soie owner, and
bad the sole and absolute and unqualified
right to dispose ot the community property aa
he pleased, to give it uway as he pleased. The
wife had no rights whatever in the community
property, except a mere hope or expectancy
that some of it might be leu at her husband's
death which she might then take, and, that
being the condition of the relative rignts of
the parties, the statute which undertook as to
that property to impose any conditions upon
the absoluteness of the right of the husband
theretofore existing under the law, was an,
abridgment oi a vested right, impairing, there-'
fore, the simplest and m.ost elemental prin
ciples which underly all our constitutions.
As I have stated to your Honors, that ques
tion is squarely presented by the record here,
and very nakedly, because it arises Upon a
demurrer to a complaim brought by the
husband and wife to recover the property, and
upon which demurrer a ruling sustaining it
was made. The plain tills, declining to amend
have appealed to your Honors.
Now, we were favored in the court below by
a learned and lengthy opinion ol the learned
court, in which the grounds upon which tho
decision was placed are very iully and very
clearly stated. This is the fundamental prop
osition which underlies the decision. After
slating what the condition of the law was
before 1891, and what the relative rights of
the parties were, as understood by the learned
Judge, he says it is evident that the interest of
the wife in the community property has been
enlarged by the amendment of 1891, in so tar
as the amendment extends, since the power of
the nusband to dispose of the property by 'gift
is subject to the wife's written consent, and to
that extent the interest of the husband is
lessened, and his vested rights in the com
munity property acquired belore the amend
ment became a law are impaired. If the
vested right of the .husband to dispose of the
community property is interferred with by
legislative enactment, the law in that respect
is unconstitutional.
This position of the learned Judge is illus
trated and amplified by the argument that
under the statute as it stood before the amend
ment, the husband had been given the abso
lute management and control of the com
munity property; that, as a result from that
grant of absolute dominion over the property,
the wife had no estate or interest, legal or
equitable, in the property, and was in no sense,
to no degree the owner oi any interest in such
property, and as a further result that the title
to the property was in the husband, and he
was in law the sole owner thereof.
The question then presented at the very
threshold of this discussion is: "Is the funda
mental proposition which undorlu-s the whole
of this opinion true? Is it correct, or was it
under our system of laws from 1849 up to
1891, that the right, or power rather, which
the husband had, to manage and control the
community property, was a vested right la
such a mauner that the grantor of that right
the Legislature of the State, could not itself
thereafter limit or circumscribe; or take away
its former grant or delegation ot authority?" '
The constitution of 1849, article XI, tection
14, is in these words:
All property, botb real and personal, of the wife'
owned or claimed before marriage, and that ac
quired afterward by gift, devise or descent, shall
be her separate property, and laws shall be passed
more c early defluinj? the rights of the wiJe in rela
tion, as well as io her separate property, as to that
held In common with her husband.
In obedience to that direstion, the legisla
ture, at its session in 185U, did enact a statute
by which it undertook to define more clearly
than the constitution had attempted to do the
rights of the wife and thÂ« rights of the hus
band in the community property, viz.: that
the husband shailhave the management of the
separate property of the wife, but no sale of
such property or lien thereon should take
place unless by an instrument in writing
signed by both husband and wife and ac
knowledged by her upon a separate examina
tion.
It has never been contended that that right
of dominion over the separate property of the
wife whs a vested right in the husband which
the Legislature could not impair. By the
codes of .his State in 1873 the Legislature
took away from the husband the right to con
trol the separate property of his wife. To con
tend that this amendment of the law giving
the husband control of hia wife's separate
property was unconstitutional, because it de
prived nim of a vested right, is manifestly
untenable.
The Supreme Court of Washington decided
in an exactly similar case that an amendment
to the law by which tne power to contiol
formerly possessed by the husband over the
community property was taken away was not
an interference with any vestea right.
la it true that under the jurisprudence and j
under the legislation of our State the wife has
no interest in the community property which
the Legislature in its wisdom may protect.'
Is it true that the husband is the sole owner of
that property as he is of his own? Is i it true
that these delegations of power which have
been conferred upon him are simply tne enun
ciation of elemental rights of property of his
own, and that they are not powers conferred
upon him as an agent or trustee to control and
manage the property for that entity composed
of himself and wife, which in the language of
the constitution holds the property in com
mon ? Such a construction as that merely
springs from loose dicta made by the Supreme
Court at an early day, and has no more foun
dation iv souna jurisprudence than it has in
natural justice. , .
What is this community of which we speak ?
The husband and wife after their marriage, or
upon their marriage, constitute in the body
politic a new unit different from their own
separate entities, a new unit which is a germ
of that other and broader unit of society called
the family. So far as this new unit or associa
tion is concerned it starts out, in the world
without any property of its own, because the
property which has theretofore belonged to
each one of the component parts of the unit is
and continues to be their separate property
and does not form any part of the fund, treas
ury or property of this new compound unit.
The husband and wife, constituting this new
community, this new association, are charged
by the policy of our law with the equal duty
of laboring with industry and saving with
frugality property for the perpetuation of the
purposes of that union, and the education,
sustenance and protection oi offspring. The
wife equally with the husband toils, equally
with the husband saves and economizes in
order to swell the growing heap of this com
munity.
The fruits of her labors equally with the
fruits of ihe labors of the husband belong to
the community, and your Honors and your
Honors' predecessors have carried the doc
trine still farther . when you have decided
that compensation made to the wife for in
juries which she had sustained are also com
munity property, so that, If the wife in an
accident shall be crippled and mangled out of
shape, shall be made a sutterer for the balance
of her days, the price that ib paid by the
wrongdoer to restore to her as far as money
can do that peace and happiness and health
which has been destroyed, becomes com
munity property. If she loses an eye, if she
loses a limb, aud she is awarded $10,000 or |
$20,000 by the law, the justice of the law in
compensation of her loss belongs to the com
munity. And shall we be told at this day that
the money earned by the wife by the sweat of
her brow, the economy wiiich has anabled her
to protect her own offspring, it may be to in
sure her peace and comfort in old age, the
very money which slu> may have re
ceived for her own physical impairment,
maiming and suffering â is it such that
slie has no proprietary interest in it? That
the husband has an absolute constitutional,
vested and inalienable right to do with that
money as he pleases, to give it to whom he
pleases, to squander it as he pleases, and the
wife cannot De heard in a court of justice to
complain? That he can bestow it upon such
objects of his bounty, charity or caprice as he
pleases, and she has no voice in a court of
justice to be heard to complain?
Whatever may have been the absolute power
of disposition of the husband in the com
munity property, it was not certainly so far
reaching as that which he had of his own, for
of his own he could dispose as he pleased,
and could defraud no one, however foolish or
improvident the gift might be. But it was set
tled in the jurisprudence of this State that as
to the community property the husband could
not dispose of it with intent to aefraud his
wife ot her just rights. The Legislature would
have had the undoubted power to enact the
substance oi those decisions into a statute, and
to any as an amendment to this section, pro
vided that a husband shall make no disposition
of the property with intent to defraud his
wife, and we wonld then have a statute simi
lar to the general one which has existed, the
statute of Charles, that no person should
make a conveyance with intent to defraud his
creditors.
Go one step farther, and as under the statute
of Charles the courts had repeatedly held that
there were certain badges which accompanied
fraudulent transactions, and which were con
clusive evidence of intent to defraud, the Leg
islature might by statute have said, taking up
the wisdom of the courts and crystallizing
these decisions into a statute, that certain
acts, or the abser.ee of certnin formalities, in
the transfer of property, should be held con
clusive evidence of the intent to defraud cred
itors.
The Legislature did so, and we have the
statute that a conveyance of that kind or a
transfer shall be conclusively deemed to have
been intended to defraud creditors, unless it
be followed by an immediate delivery and a
continued change of possession.
Assuming it to be established as a part of the
law of this State that the husband has no right
to transfer community property, with Intent
to defraud his wife, assume a statute of that
kind enacted, and the decisions are equivalent
to a statuteâ it was perfectly competent fpr the
Legislature as a rule of evidence to prescribe
that certain things done, or the absence of cer
tain things undone, should be conclusive evi
dence of intent on the part of the husband to
defraud the wife. Now the power of the hus
band to give away community property, the
right, assuming the equal proprietary right of
the wife, was never based upon anvtning but
the presumed assent of the wife and could not
be, justly or philosophically. The statute has
but enacted a rule of evidence upon this sub
ject, when It has Raid in substance that tbe
gift of the community property by the hus
band shall be conclusively presumed to. be in
fraud of the wife, unless her written assent
there Â«o has been procured.
In answering Mr. Ash contended that it
would be impracticable as well as impos
sible for a man to secure the consent of
his wife to all transfers of property. Buch
a law or such a construction of the code,
he said, would seriously interfere with
business and create endless trouble. At
the close of his argument the case was
submitted.

The fish, with four others of its kind,
all weighing in the neighborhood of five
pounds, will swim in the aquarium at the

"The fish," said Mr. Babcock, "came
from a lake in the woods in Sierra County.
They were planted there in 1891, having
been taken from Eastern waters.
"Sportsmen and people interested at
all in fish should snrely go and look at
them. They are simply marvelous for
size. I never saw, except in the Smithso
nian Institution, a fish of this kind larger
than two nnd a half pounds. The biggest
specimen I saw in U:e Chicago aquarium
weighed on* pound and a half.
"This fish is very much like a salmon,
although it doss not belong to the salmon
class at all, and is usually a small fish.
"They were shipped down by Captain

SENT TO STATE
PRISON FOR LIFE,
The Destiny of Becker and
Creegan, the Celebrated
Forgers.
NEW TRIAL WAS DENIED
Prior Convictions Seal the Fate
of the Nevada Bank
Swindlers.
STAY OF EXECUTION GRANTED
History of the Crime of Which the
Two Notorious Rogues Were
Convicted.
To Btate prison for life. That is the
sentence Judge Wallace imposed upon
James Creegan and Charles Becker, the
convicted forgers.
The crime for which the "Prince of
Formers" and his "pal" will in all proba
bility spend tbe balance of their lives be
hind prison bars was one of the most sen
sational bank swindles ever perpetrated
in California. In December last Frank
beaver, alias A. H. Dean, deposited a draft
for $22,000 at the Nevada Bank. Dean
already had an a ccount there, having es
tablished it a short time before. The draft
was on the Crocker-Woolworth Bank and
was drawn by a financial institution.
The Crocker - Woolworth Bank ac
knowledged the draft to be all right, and
two days later Dean drew $20,000 from the
Nevada Bank.
It was subsequently found that the draft
had been raised from $12 to $22,000.
Becker, Creegan, Dean and others were
suspected of complicity in the crime, and
after a long chase were arrested, Becker
and Creegan being the last of the opera
tors to be taken into custody, and that on
the eve of their departure for Guatemala.
Great interest has been taken in the
case by banking authorities all over the
country, and a determined effort was made
convict Becker and Creegan, the former to
being regarded as tbe penman and the
latter as the general manager of number
less clever forgeries whicn have Deen suc
cessfully carried out in recent years.
Captain .Lees was the recipient of much
congratulation when he arrested his men,
and personally interested himself in the
trial which, through the turning of State's
evidence of Dean, alias Seaver, resulted in
the conviction of the accused several
| weeks ago. Sentence has been put off a
number ot times to allow counsel to pre
pare arguments for a new trial.
The celebrated swindlers were again be
j fore the court yesterday for sentence, but
I It was hardly expected that the penalty
I lor having repeatedly broken the law of
the land would be meted out to them. It
was rather supposed that the eloquence of
their attorney, Peter Dunne, would secure
to the forgers a new trial.
During the trial which resulted in tbe
conviction of the Eastern crooks, the
attorneys for the defense noted over 100
exceptions to the rulings of the court, and
it was confidently believed by the prison
ers that one or more of the legal tech
nicalities would be made to stick, and in
] consequence, a rehearing be allowed.
Mr. Dunne, in his argument for a new
trial, was rather severe in his remarks as
to tne rulings of Judge Wallace, and did
not hesitate to score his Honor, particu
larly as to the admission of the evidence
of McCloskey. He claimed that tne ques
tion, "Were you arraigned on a charge oi
being an accomplice of these men?"
should not have been allowed, and that
the effect of tbe question and its answer,
"Yes," was highly prejudicial to his
clients.
The query, "Were you tried and ac
quitted?" was also put to McCloskey, and
to this Dunne objected but was overruled.
It was also made a subject of comment in
the argument.
Dunne vigorously attacked the Judge's
charge to the jury, making that portion
which referred to the facts in the case the
point of assault
Judge Wallace said to the jury that the
evidence tended to show that Becker com
mitted the forgery in Oaklaud, and there
fore the courts here had no jurisdiction
over the actual charge of forgery, but
could convict him of uttering the forged
draft in San Francisco. Dunno claimed
that the charge in this part decided upon
a question of fact instead of law, and that
tbe court had no right to make such re
marks to the jurymen.
Judge Wallace in summing the matter
up said that he bad been very careful dur
ing tne trial and had looked after the
interests of the defendants equally with
those of the prosecution. There had been
a number of objections taken on techni
calities, but he was satisfied that the ac
cused had had a fair and impartial trial
and did not think they should be per-
raltted another on purely technical points.
Their rights and chances of acquittal had
in io way been infringed on and he did
not think it was tbe idea of the law that a
man should be indulged, simply because a
technical point had been violated.
In conclusion Judge Wallace announced
that because of the prior convictions
against the prisoners he would sentence
them to State prison for life.
Creegan never flinched when the words
forever depriving him of his liberty were
uttered, but Becker shuddered and his
pale face became whiter. He lias not the
nerve of his accomplice, who is as stoical
as an Indian.
ZThe matter will now in all probability
be carried to the Supreme Court on an
argument for a new trial. A stay of exe
cution was granted for ten days.

hurriedly, and the pickets were painted a

the color, shoved their noses between

like a St. Patrick's day celebration.
Not content with decorating their funny
little nasal appendages, they commenced
to lick off the paint, ana had been at work

by an attendant on the grounds. They
manifested violent symptoms of intoxica

The Wanp's Crowning: JSffort Flctorially
Conies Out This Morning.
A copy has been received of the Wasp's
pictorial edition which is given to the
public this morning. It will be perused
with much interest by all who are anxious
to get a glimpse of San Francisco in its va
rious stages of advancement during the
past fifty years. It is a work of art, and
on a scale never before attempted in the
West. The old landmarks and vacant
sites of the early days are contrasted with
the imposing structures of the present
day. Streets which were at one time im
peded here and there with hills of sand,
rickety fences and shanties are presented
as busy thoroughfares with a system of
cable and electric cars unsurpassed in the
world. In short, it is an edition which in
after years will be invaluable.
Among the literary features are: The
Transformation of Yerba Buena; Impres
sions of Vigilante Days; Architectural
Transformations; They Come Like Shad
ows, so Depart (history of the drama);
Society in Early Days; The Rise of Ship
building on the Coast; Our Moneyed Insti
tutions; Needs of San Francisco, and
many minor contributions.
The San Francisco Call and its future
home, together with a review of Mr. Short
ridge's broad-gauge policy and his stand
ing in the newspaper world, are impar
tially but fairly criticized.
The edition is bound to be popular.

The Chronicle is sending out its wild
campaign stories in relays. When one
gets out of wind and sits down by the
roadside to rest on its lyre, others are sent,
after it in relays to keep it company down
the straight path that leads to political
perdition.
The Chronicle announced the other day
that County Clerk Curry and John D.
Spreckels had quarreled and that Mr.
Curry was about to discharge from his
service all the friends of Mr. SprecKels
and of A. J. Martin. This was disproved
emphatically by both parties.
The relay lie was started on his mission
by the Chronicle yesterday morning.
The statement was made that Oscar S.
Tolle had been appointed a member of tha
finance committee of tbe Thirty-ninth
District Republican Club, an anti-Spreck

Mr. Tolie came to The Call editorial
rooms last night and stated that his name
was not on the roll of the club and never
would be and that any statement to the
contrary was a falsehood.
"My name is No. 1 on the rolls of five or
six political organizations friendly to John
D. Spreckels," he added. "I am secretary
of the Republican Executive Council of
California, of which Mr. Spreckels is vice
presideiit. I am treasurer of the Bear

KISSED MRS, CRAVEN
The Lady's Nurse Tells
of Several Tender
Passages.
HIS MANY INTERVIEWS
He Told the Attendant That
They Were Betrothed and
Would Marry.
ALSO CALLED HER "DEARIE"
Once He Said That He Would Build
Her a Fine Mansion on His Lot
on Nob Hill.
The deposition of Mrs. Margaret S.
Cosack, a professional nurse, in reference
to her knowledge of th*Â» relations of Sena
tor James G. Fail and Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven, was taken yesterday in the office,
of Delmes <fc Shortridge. Mrs. Cosack tes
tified that in her presence Senator Fair
said in 1891 that Mrs. Craven was be
trothed to him, and that he was going to
marry her, and that on several occasions
Senator Fair kissed Mrs. Craven. He also
expressed concern for Mr?. Craven re
peatedly, asserted his right to look out for
her, because they were betrothed, and
Mrs. Craven, in the presence of Mrs. i
Cosock, confirmed what Senator Fair had
said concerning the betrothal.
In addition to kissing Mrs. Craven be
fore Mrs. Cosack Senator Jf'air habitually
addressed her as "Dearie" whenever they
met. Only one deposition was taken yes
terday, but that one was quite interesting.
The substance of Mrs. Cosack's testimony
is triven below:
Margaret S. Cosack deposed that she
has lived in San Francisco twenty-two
years. Her business is that of a profes
sional nurse and this has been her busi
ness ever since she came to California.
She nursed Nettie R. Craven once. That
was in 1891, about the first of September.
She nursed Mrs. Craven taree weeks at
the Colonial Hotel, at the corner of Jones
ana Pine streets. Mrs. Craven's room was
at the head of the stairs on the Jones
street side on the first floor. While she
. was sick the room was changed to the
second or third floor on the other side of
the building.
The witness knew Senator Fair and
met him at Mrs. Craven's room. She saw
him several times in Mrs. Craven's room.
He was always very affectionate toward
Mrs. Craven. * He spoke to her in affec
tionatt terms and called her "Dearie," em
bracing her at her bedside.
Once Mrs. Craven was so sick that she
sent for Judge Sullivan to make her will.
He drew her will. Senator Fair was there.
After the will was drawn Mrs. Craven was
much excited â so much so that after the
will had been drawn she grew wor?e and
was in a critical condition and like y to
die during three or four days. Concern
ing the drawing of the will and what fol
lowed Mrs. Cosack said:
"Senator Fair went for me and said that
I was tbe nurse and that Mrs. Craven was
in my charge and 1 had no -igh. t to pei
mit her to have the will drawn. I did not
recoenize his right to speak so to me and
t od him so.
'â¢Senator Fair said: 'I have a right to
protect this woman. She is my betrothed.'
Tnen he turned to Mrs. Craven and asked,
'Is not that so, dearie?' Mrs. Craven said
'3'es' to this- Senator Fair told me to take
particular care of Mrs. Craven and said
that he could not afford to take any
chances, and he save me $20 to get any
little delicacy Mrs. Craven might need, bo
that she need not wait for meals."
"Did he say anytning about his rela
tions toward Mrs. Craven?" asked Mr.
Del mas.
"Yes; he said that he intended to marry
her. He also said that he intended to give
her something more cheerful to think
about than wills or dying and that he
meant to build a house for her on his
California-street lot, and sne would have
the finest mansion about there."
Mr?. Cosack also testified that Senator
Fair gave her $20 at another time and
told her to go to the restaurant at any
time to get delicacies for Mrs. Craven.
He caused Mrs. Craven's room to be
changed. One afternoon, when he was
present, the elevator was running very
rapidiy. The elevator was next to Mrs.
Craven's room. He said that this would
not do, and he ordered tuat her room
(â hould be changed and that she should
have the best room in the house.
After Mrs. Craven was moved upstairs
Senator Fair said one day that be mipht
be gone for a few days. He told Mrs.
Cosack on several occasions to take the
best care oi Mrs. Craven and not to let any
one see her.
He said that he was going to marry Mrs.
Craven and he had a right to look out for
her. He objected one afternoon to the
mufic of a piano in a room near by, upon
which a young lady was practicing, and
said that it must be stopped. It was
stopped and the piano was moved away to
tue children's room of the hotel.
Mr. Pierson cross-examined. The wit
mtt did not know exactly when she was
at Mrs. Craven's room â that is, not tbe
exact date. She kept no books. She was
three weeks constantly witn Mrs. Craven.
All the time Mrs. Craven was very sick,
but sat up the last three or four days that
tne witness was there. Mrs. Cosack never
knew Mrs. Craven prior to that sickness.
She has seen Mrs. Craven since, and once
was about three weeks aeo. Mrs. Cosack
did not at that time tell Mrs. Craven what
she would testify to, and Mrs. Craven did
not ask. Mrs. Craven knew, of course,
what the witness must have overheard
during her sickness.
Mrs. Craven asked several questions.
Mrs. Johnson asked more questions. Mrs.
Johnson came to Mrs. Cosack in last July
and asked concerning her memory. Mrs.
Johnson keeps the Colonial. Mrs. John
son said that she wanted to know what
Mrs. Cosack knew, "and I said that I did
not want to be in the case or have any
thing to do with the case." The witness
had talked only with Mrs. Johnson and
Mrs. Craven and Mr. Foley. who ia her
lawyer.
Mn>. Cosack continued her statement to
the effect that while Mrs. Craven was very
ill Senator Fair called every day. She
made her will in the evening at 8 o'clock.
Senator Fair was not there when the will
was made. He never called in the even
ing, for the physician, Dr. Reynolds of
Alameda, came in the evening. The room
which Mrs. Craven occupied in the Colo
nial when she was first ill had an alcove,
but it was all one apartment. Senator
Fair generally came between 4 and 5
o'clock in the afternoon. He did not send
his card up, but came up and knocked at
the door and the witness let him in.
"Senator Fair said that she should
make no will without his consent. She
was his betrothed and he had a right to
look oat for her. He always stepped up
to the oedside when he came and embraced
her." . , ,
'What do you mean by 'embraced
her'? "asked Mr. Pierson.
â¢'He kissed her," answered the witness,
with sharp emphasis.
Tbe depositions will' be continued Sep
tember 11 in lhe case of Angus et ai. vs*
Nettie R. Craven et al. Next Friday after i
noon the deposition of Charles L. Fair
will be continued, and the depositions of
Attorneys Lloyd and Wood and Charles
S. Neale will be taken.
CASE IN THE COURTS.
Attorney Wheeler's Latest Demur-
rÂ«r Overruled by Judge Slack.
The latest of Charles S. Wheeler's de
murrers in the Fair case was overruled by
Judge Slack yesterday after an interesting
little dialogue between Mr. Wheeler and
Van E. Paterson and the court.
Mr. Wheeler objected to Mr. Paterson' s
fourth amended opposition on the ground
that it was uncertain in that it opposed
the will of September 24 on the ground
that it was a forgery and again on the
ground that the earlier will had been sus
tained by a repubiication. He remarked
that they were all very desirous of expedit
ing the litigation.
Judge Slack in some astonishment re
marked that it would be as well not to
speak of expedition in regard to this case,
at which all the lawyers, including Mr.
Wheeler, smiled broadly.
The court inquired of Mr. Paterson if
his position was not a little inconsistent.
"Not at all," said Judge Paterson. "All
through our opposition the ground taken
is that the later will is a forgery, and I am
amazed that the point should be raised
by counsel. The statement as to the re
publication is simply one of fact to sup
port the other. In case any other wills
should be found bearing date between tbe
21st and the 24tn that statement would be
most material.
"It seems remarkable to me," continued
Mr. Paterson, "that such stienuous efforts
should be made to deprive these babes
wtiom I represent and who have no money
or standing in court, especially in view of
tbe fact that Charles L. Fair, the only
other contestant, takes more under the
pencil will than he does under the earlier
will." He desired to be informed as to the
reason. He suege^ted that Fair could not
be serious in his contest, and was only de
sirous of getting the children out of the
way.
Wheeler did not vouchsafe an explana
tion, but said that if the allegation of re
publication was not an issue it should be
i stricken out.
Paterson objected. "I wish to be can
did with tbe court," be said. "I may
wish to make claim to that ground later."
The court decided to overrule the de
murrer. Mr. Wheeler then entered into
an argument to strike out the reference to
tbe repubiication. He attempted to show
that a mere statement of the legatee did
not amount to a rtpublication â that it was
necessary that some additional provision
of the will be made in order to bring it
within that category.
Judge Paterson will reply next Monday.

TWO KITES FLEW

Weather Forecaster W. H.
Hammon Scores a
Triumph.
BEEN BEATEN BUT ONCE
The Most Successful Experiment
Ever Made on This
Coast.
SOAR HIGH ABOVE THE CLOUDS
Enough Electricity Runs Down the
Wire to Knock a Man Off
Hs Feet.
Yesterday afternoon Weather Forecaster
W. H. Hammon and Assistant Alexander
McAdie conducted the most successful
Rite-flying that has been done up to this
The Cellular Kite in Midair, and the Same Kite Collapsed, Showing the
Inge nions Invention of W. 11. Hammou.
time west of the Rocky Mountains. In
fact, it came next to the most pnccessful
in tLis line that ' has occurred in the
world.
Two large kites were given to the fresh
breeze blowing over the Mills building
about half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
One was the immense 84-inch cellular
kite, the invention of Mr. Hammon, and
the other was 67 inches from top to bot
tom. The kites were held by piano wire
let off from a large reel.
The wind was blowing about twelve
miles an hour, coming from the southwest.
The kites rose steadily and without acci
dent until the smaller kite reached an
elevation of 4100 feet above the roof of
the Mills building, or 4275 feet above sea
level. The length of wire unreeled was
6656 feet.
At this height the kites made an angle
with the surface of the earth of 33% de
grees. In bringing the kites back an
angle of 60 degrees was obtained.
The huge niers looked like small white
specks aeainst the sky. At times big
patches of white clouds between 3000 and
4000 feet above the City passed between
the kites and the observers on the roof of
the building. When 2500 feet of wire had
been let out the kites began moving to the
north, showing that the wind at that ele
vation came directly from the south.
Cominz down they twisted around to the
northeast again, as they became influenced
by the lower ccrrents. .
The electrical current generated on the
wire was sufficient to give a sharp shock
without a condenser. With a condenser
an amount of force was generated suffi
cient to knock a man down, and a large
spark was produced.
The kites soared out it seemed clear over
Goat Island.
Professor Davidson was one of the party
and he was enthusiastic over the results
obtained. "This beats," said he, "any
thing this side of the Rockies, and is
nearly as good as has ever been done."
"We have been wonderfully successful,"
said Mr. Hammon. "If we had had in
struments we would have made some very
valuable experiments. The cellular kite
was the invention of Hargrave of
Australia. He designed it while working
out a flying machine idea.
"Hargrave's cells were rectangular.
Potter of the Weather Bureau in Wash
ington, D. C, changed tbem to diamond
shape. These kites are almost the same,
with the exception of an invention of my
own, whereby the itnes become collaps
ible and therefore vastly more convenient
to handle. It only takes live minutes to
unfold my kite or to fix it up.
'â¢We have been flying kites since last
February, but with varying success. The
surface winds are generally too shallow.
To-day there were moderate storm con
ditions. The atmosphere was in an un
settled condition, and there was this same
moderate wind to a very high altitude.
This has been a great triumph. With in
struments it would have been fraught with
valuable results."
Professor Clement L. Wragpe, who has
charge of the weather department over all
of Australia, with headquarters at Bris
bane, paid the Weather Bureau here a
visit yesterday, and expressed great Won
derment at the extreme rapidity with
which a forecast was published from the
time tbe observation was taken.

HASKELL NOT DISBARRED.
He May Be, However, if He Doei not Pay
a Certain Note.
Judge Slack yesterday dismissed the dis
barment proceedings pending against
B. G. Haskell. In dismissing the matter,
his Honor remarked that the reason for
dismissal was that the evidence produced
did not substantiate the complaint.
Haskell is tbe attorney who gained a
damage suit from the railroad company
in behalf of Charles Yonng. Young
claimed that Haskell appropriated the
money. It was developed during the dis
barment proceedings that the attorney
had given his client some sort of a note in
lieu of the money, and he therefore could
not be convicted of embezzling it.
Judge Siack, in delivering his decision
as to the matter, advised Youns to bring
civil proceedings against Haskell to re
cover the money due on the note, and
added that it it was brought to his atten
tion that Haskell sought to evade pay
ment of the note, be would then be pre
pared to listen to proceedings for disbar
ment.

Inspectors Dockery and Davis Are
Visiting the Dairy Ranches
Dai y.
Milk Inspector Dockery and Market
Inspector Davis of the Board of Health
spent yesterday in visiting a number of
milk ranches at Bay View and along the
San Bruno road, with a view to ascertain
ing their condition aa to sanitation and
cleanliness.
Seven ranches were inspected and in
nearly all orders for changes, increased
ventilation and other improvements were
issued. "Clean up" was the general order
and in all cases the dairymen promised to
do so at once.
In future all ranchers will be asked how
long it will taKe to place their dairies in a
sanitary condition, and will be given from
ten to twenty day* to make such improve
ments as are directed. In case thty fail to
comply with the orders they will lay them
selves liable to revocation of their milk
permits, ai Inspector Dockery will rec
ommend such a course.
Mr. Dockery will, during the progress of
his investigations, which are to be carried
on now from day to day, collect data to
hack up certain recommendations to the
board which he is now preparing. These
are intended to improve the general con
dition of the ranches and force sanitary
arrangements on all.
Another important object that is being
served by his visits to tbe ranches is the
detection of suspected cases of tuberculosis,
pending tests with the Government tuber
culin. â¢
The herds of every ranch visited will be
inspected, and all cows giving evidence of
the disease will bo singled ont and the
owners warned not to sell tbem until the
regular test has been made, t-ome dis
tinguishing mark will be put on them and
a record kept of the matter, so that when
tbe testing visit is made the inspector can
be sure that they are all there.

BEDLAM BROKE
LOOSE IN COURT,
Two Fierce Fights Between
An Attorney and
Detectives*
JUDGE LOW INDIGNANT.
Lawyer A. B. Treadwell and
Sleuth Curtin Have the
First Set- To.
HONORS WERE ABOUT EAST.
Then Treadwell Got Mixed Up With
Cnrtin's Assistants, and Was
Arrested for Contempt.
A violent scene was witnessed in Judge
Low's courtroom last night during the
preliminary examination of E. E. Dunn,
charged by the Merton Manufacturing
Company with grand larceny.
Dunn was arrested by Private Detective
Curtin and Detective Cody, and Curtin
and two of his men were in court. A. B.
Treadwell appeared for the defendant and
Reel B. Terry acted on behalf of the prose
cution.
When the case was called Attorney
Treadwell asked for a continuance, as he
was not ready to go on, but after argu
ment it was decided to proceed. Tread
well then asked that all tbe witnesses in
the case should be excluded. Tne Judge
made the order. Curtin and his two men
remained in court.
President Albert N. Bailey of the com
pany took the stand, and his examination
was going on when Treadwell, noticing
Curtin and his two assistants, said he
thought that all witnesses had been or
dered out of the court.
"These men are not witnesses," said the
Judge.
"They are worse," said Treadwell.
"They are detectives, and have been
bounding my client to death."
"You are a liar," retorted Cur
tin.
Tread well's faceÂ«flushed with passion
and he strode toward Curtin arM struck
him a blow over the left eye with his fist.
Curtin shot out his right and caught
Treadwell on the chin, and it was give
and take till one of Curtin" s men caught
Treadwell on the chin and knocked him
down.
The Judge had been yelling and rapping
for order, but no attention was paid to
him, and finally he ordered Policeman
Wallace, who is attached to the court, and
Policeman Livingston to see that order
was kept, otherwise he threatened to com
mit the fighters for contempt. This had
the desired effect, and both Treadwell and
Curtin regained their composure.
The examination of Bailey was con
tinned and Tredwell persistently inter
jected objections. He had got to near
where Curtin and his assistants were
seated and seemed to be in a nervous and
excited state. One of Curtin's men, think
ing that Treadwell intended to renew the
fight, struck him a blow in the face. They
fougiit for a minute or two till Treadwell
was knocked against the steps leading to
the witness-stand and Bailey took him by
the coat collar and pusbed him down.
Both of Curtin's men jumped on top of
Treadwell pounding him and Bailey was
holding him down. Policemen Wallace
I and Liviucston jumped in and pulled
them off Treadwell. Everybody in the
court was excited and the Judge was stand
j ing up and rapping londly for order.
After quiet had been restored the Judge
ordered Treadwell into custody for con
tempt of court and adjourned court till
this morning. Treadwell protested vie
orously, asserting vociferously tnat Cur
tin struck him first, but bis protests were
unheeded. Policeman Wallace left with
Treadwell for thep City Prison, but they
had only gone along the corridor a few
yards when Treadwtll changed his mind
and insisted upon returning to the court.
Wallace tried to pall him along and a
struggle ensued. Treadwell, who is a
powerful man, threw Wallace, but Wal
lace clung to him and got onto his feet.
Then they wrestled along the corridor,
and while a few men were discussing tbe
fracas in the court the glass of the court
room door was smashed in and Treadwell
and Wallace, locked in si deathlike grip,
cams staggerine in. They wrestled along
the floor till Wallace jjot Treadwell into a
scat and held him there. Both were blow
ing like porpoises.
Treodwell positively refused to be locked
up and denied that the Judge had so or
dered. Word was sent to poiice head
quarters and the Central police station
and Sergeants Bethel and Green, Detec
tive Reynolds and Policemen Irvine and
Rooker "made their appearance. They did
not know what to do, as Treadwell pro
claimed himself an officer of the court
and denied that the Judge would cast such
an indignity upon nim.
The Judge bad left the courtroom, but
returned at this moment and ordered the
officers to arrest Treadwell for contempt.
Treadwell resisted and it took every one
of tbem to drag him out of the courtroom
and along the corridor to the City Prison.
He fougnt all the way and gave angry
voice to his feelings.
He calmed down when in the prison,
but was loud in hie denunciation of the
Judge for not committing Curtin and his
men for contempt also.
Judge Low left an order for Treadweil to
be released at 11 o'clock, and at that hour
he got his liberty.
Attorney Reel Terry, who happened to
be in tbe courtroom, said afterward that
he felt thankful to have escaped without a
scratch. He and Judge Low later at
tended the Choynski-McAuliffe set-to at
Woodward's, and agreed that it was a
much tamer affair than the courtroom
contest.
SET THE DECREE, ASIDE.
Judge Troutt Reopen* the Divorce Case
of Margaret L,. Horton.
Judge Troutt yesterday set aside the
decree of divorce in the case of Margaret
L. Horton, whose husband, an Australian
physician, obtained a divorce from her by
means of fraudulent representation. At
torney Harris, who filed an appearance
for Mrs. Horton, was only reprimanded
by Judge Troutt. it being shown tnat he
acted in the matter in behalf of a disbarred
attorney named Howe.
The decision leaves the matter still
open, ana Mrs. Horton has ten days in
which to tile an answer.
Dr. Horton now has tiro wives, as im
mediately after securing thÂ« divorce he
married Miss Louisa Martin, the woman
with whom be eloped from Australia.

Entries and Handicaps of the Lib-
erty Cycling Club's Road Race.
Club runs are becoming less freauent
as tbe Sundays pass by, owing to the dusty
condition of the roads and the heat of the
country. After the first rains, however,
touring will be renewed one might say,
for in California the best time for riding
is in the fall months.
There is one road race scheduled for to
morrow, that of the Liberty Cycling Club,
which will be held over the San Leandro-
Haywards course at 2p. M. The entries
and handicaps are as follows: Albert
Shieb, F. R. Haley, F. Struven, scratch ;
Thomas White, H. Wahnig, 30 seconds;
Ben Muller, Charles Lieb, Fred Rusher,
1:00; M. Kielberg, Charles Barnes, 1:30;

have a run to the park to-morrow, leaving
their clubhouse at 10:30 a. m. under Cap

George E. Sheldon of the Bay City
Wlaeelmen has returned from an extended
trip to the north. Victor A. Hancock of
the same club left Stockton Wednesday
morning en route to Lake Tahoe in the
interest of the league road book, a new
edition of which will be issued about
September 15. The Tahoe trip has never
appeared on the road maps of former
editions, and Mr. Hancock makes the trip
for that purpose.
David Marshall of the Bay City's has
returned from Stockton, where he has
been for the past week on a business and
pleasure trip.
If W. A. Terrill, the champion profes
sional rider of the coast, cannot get a
match race with Downing of the Garden
City Cyclers, or does not care to ride
against Downing, he can have a match
with Oscar Osen at Stockton on September
9, and the athletic club there will put up a
good-sized purse for the event. The
Stockton half-mile track is being watered
and rolled daily and will be a fast course
on the day of the races.
There are a number of the cracks now in
training on the Kan Jose three-lap track,
and the Garden City Cyclers meet on the
9th Drox. will draw a large number of en
trants and the usual crowds of spectators.
Ed. Chapman, one of the Olympic
Wneelmen's promising amateurs, has
joined the professional ranks, more at the
suggestion of the racing board than of his
own volition. He should do well in handi
cap events.
J. L. Bothwell, a prominent member of
the Garden City Cyclers, is in the City on
a visit. Bert Tnorndyke of the same"club<
is also here on his return from Stockton,
where he has been visiting relatives.
The Eintracht Cyclers will have a club
run to Camp Taylor to-morrow under
Captain Frank, leaving on the first boat.
The women rider* of the East have ef
fected a pretty combination for tbe warm
days. The hot and cumbersome leather
and canvas leggins are not worn so gener
ally as they were earlier in the year. The
skirts have been lengthened slightly and
ordinary stockings are worn. These look
neat and comfortable. The women are also
wearing a fetching shirt waist in pleasant
colors wit h^ very wide sleeves. The effect
is pretty. As they skim by with these X
ray sleeves fluttering' in the wind they
look not unlike gigantic butterflies.
The North California Division, League
of American Wheelmen, has issued the
following circular to ail local consuls,
league hotels and representatives, which
explains itself:
San Francisco, August 20, 1896.
Dear Sir: I beg to advise you that certain
parties, professing to be connected with the
North California Division, League of American
Wheelmen, are soliciting advertisements for a
road book, announcing that it is the official
League of American Wheelmen road book.
Such statements are false, and you are urged
to use your power among your townspeople,
informing them of this fact.
The official league road book of this division
is now being completed, and will be issued
about September 30, and the only advertise
ments to be found therein are from the trades
people of San Francisco.
Kindly give this the publicity which it de
serves, thereby aiding the board of officers of
this division. Fraternally yours.
North California Division, League of Ameri
can Wheelmen.
Fkank 11. Kerrigan, Chief Consul.
Stanley G. Soovern, Secretary-Treasurer.
The San Francisco Road Club will have
a run to-morrow to Mill Valley und Lark
spur, under Captain Pixley, taking the 9
o'clock boat from this side.
President Con well of tne Cycle Board of
Trade has appointed J. W. Maguire, I.
Schwartz and James M. Hamilton a com
mittee to arrange a banquet of the board
with the South Side Improvement Club, a
iittle feature which has been on the tapis
ever since the big parade on July 25.
Walter B. Fawcett has resigned the cap
taincy of the Olympic Club Wheelmen,
but this fact has created little surprise, as
he has been so employed of late in the
conduct of race meets that he has had little
chance to give any attention to the club,
and T. G. Spillane has been acting as cap
tain in his stead. Mr. Spillane may now
be honored with the captaincy, or the
honor may fall upon Lieutenant Plage
man.
M ssrs. Stratton, Cosgriff, Edwards,
Ravlin and Hadenfeldt of the Olympic
Club Wbeeimen will ride to San Jose to
day, returning to-morrow. They compose
a committee from their club to arrange for
a joint road race with the Garden City Cy
ciers at five miles, to take place about Sep
tember 20. Such an event should be of
considerable interest.
Chief Consul Kerrigan bas called a meet
ing of the North California Division,
League of American Wheelmen, for Satur
day evening, September 5, at/the rooms of
tbe Bay City Wheelmen, and all delegates
and representatives are requested to be
present.
The Raisin City Cyclers of Fresno have

The club starts under auspicious circum
stances, having a charter-roll of eighty
four members. Besides these, twenty
eight more were elected at the last meeting.
R. M. Thompson is the local consul of the
league at Fresno and will do all in his
power to have the Raisin City Cyclers
made a league club. Mr. Thompson is in
the cycle business there and is very popu
lar with all the riders.
The entries for the race-meets at Stock
ton and San Jose on September 9 (Admis
sion day) will close next Wednesday with
the secretaries of the Stockton Athletic
Club and the Garden City Cyclers respect
ively. The handicaps will be announced
a few days later.
The brake is bound to grow in favor.
Circumstances during the last few .veets
force this conclusion upon the students of
the cycle trade. Accidents, several fatal
ones among the number, have occurred in
the East lately and it has been shown that
in each case a brake, had there been one
attached, could doubtless have averted the
fatality. It now apparently remains for a
really clever device to be placed upon the
market for it to score a great success. A
good brake is really wanted. The cyclists
realize it and eack day they are becoming
more and more convinced of its necessity.
An expert rider has said: "If brakes were
in universal use the number of accidents
would be decreased nearly 50 per cent.
Even the dreaded and universally con
demned scorcher would not be so terrify
ing if he had a brake on his wheel. It
would be of decided benefit even on level
places where a stop could be made quickly.
No one needs to be told that it would be a
decided advantage on hills.
"The novice, above ail others, snould not
' attempt to ride in a hilly country without
a brake. The art of back-pedaling is an
accomplishment which should be acquired
by al!, but there are times when even that
does not avail. The foot may slip at a
critical moment, or any one of a dozen
minor accidents happen, which makes it
imperative that the speed of the wheel be
checked at once. That cannot be done
successfully and without risk of injuring
the rider or the wheel without a brake, ail
assertions to the contrary notwithstand
ing."
Entry blanks are out for the road races
to be held over the Ross Valley course,
from Tamalpais to San Rafael, Sunday,
September 13. There will be a five-mile
handicap, starting at 11 a. m., and a mile
handicap, starting at 2:30 p. m. Entries
should be sent to Frank M. ByrnÂ«. box
715, San Rafael, not later than Thursday,
September 10. The events are open to
amateurs oniy, and will doubtless attract
a large number of riders if the prizes are
at all valuable. The prize list has not yet
been given out, however.
The annual meeting of the Bay City
Wheelmen will be held next Tuesday
evening, September 1, at the clubrooms,

Fred C. Chandler, who manages the in
terests of tne Lozier people on this coast,
LEONARD GILL, Captain of the Olympic dub Athletes, "Who
Will Retire From Duty on September 7.
returned ' from his Australian trip, via
Honolulu, Thursday. He reports the
cycle trade as brisk in Australia, but there
are any number of different makes of
wheels, agenciesiand rental piaces, and the
business is likely to be overdone, as it was
here a year or so ago. There will always
be a demand for high-grade American
made wheels there, however, and Austra
lia will hereafter cut a large figure in our
bicycle exnort trade. The riders there
prefer wheels somewhat heavier than those
in use in America. Bicycle races are
largely attended, it being the reigning
sport. It is nothing to see from 30.000 to
40,000 people at a meet, the grounds being
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AtTGrTTST 29, 1896,'
always built with a view to accommodat
ing that number. To them 10,000 would
be a poor crowd ; to us it would be an im
mense mob. Professional racing is the
proper thing, of course, and there is a
great deal of betting on the results. The
sport is squarely conducted, there seldom
being any crooked work heard of, which
probably accounts for the support it re
ceives from the public. Spalding.
Neat cards are out for the twenty-eighth
annual outing of the Red EocK Juveniles

The Red Rockers never do anything by

c&sional events. On this occasion there
will be\a 100-yard race between Officer Bill
Harrison and Henry Hart and fancy bicy
cle riding by Captain Rome Harris and
Billy Driscoll. The ladies will sing and

ATHLETICS.
The Captain of the Olympic Club
on the New Football Team.
Leonard Gill, the present captain of the
Olympic Club athletes, who will retire
with the old board in September, sends
the following letter to The Call, which
should interest the officers of the new
board, and especially the football team.
Gill says:
If the coming board of directors of the
Olympic Club will give the football team
proper support this fall tne Olympic Club will
have by far the best team in its history. The
main fault last season was that the formation
of a team was left to such a late period in the
season that the team did not have the neces
sary time to properly organize and condition
itself. This year both of these drawbacks have
been overcome, and at the present time suf
ficient work has been accomplished to insure
a first-class eleven, and all thut is needed to
put a first-class team in the field is substantial
support from the incoming board of directors.
Percy Morse, an old football player and a
star at that, will be the club's new captain, and
as he is an enthusiast on the game, the team
will no doubt be given due recognition.
At a recent meeting "Pete" Smith was again
elected captain of the team and the selection
was undoubtedly a good one. He Is a hard
worker, plays the game for the -love of it and
has not a superior in has position as guard.
Pete weighs over 200 pounds in his football
clothes and was a protege of Heffelfiuger's.
It is not exactly known at the present time
who the club has to draw from for the other
guard; possibly Plunkett might be induced to
till this position on the team, and should he
not play wilh Berkeley this season in all prob
ability he will play with the Olympics.
Middlemass and a new aspirant by the name
of Mason will also try for guard. "Mason has
had experience on minor elevens, and as he
strips at 190 pounds and is willing to iearn he
will no doubt be a great acquisition. Frank
Kington will be again found at his old position
at center. Kington is bigger than ever, as well
as stronger. He has been putting in his spare
moments of late boxing wilh Choynski,
Stelzner, and wrestllni; and boxing with Van
Buskirk until he has become already in excel
lent condition.
Billy Sexton will again be fonnd at tackle,
and from present indications Douglass, one of
last year's Varsi'y Berkeley tackles, will play
the other tackle Virgil Nahl and Mclsaacs,
a last year's St. Mary's player, are probably the
strongest ends the team has this early in the
season, but we may possibly be able to induce
Abe Lewis to join the team, in which event the
team will be particularly strong at end.
Tommy Codey will play quarter, and with his
four years' experience with Stanford he will
strengthen the team in more ways than one,
and should prove a great assistant to its
captain.
The eleven at the present time has Percy
Morse, Fred McNear, Fred Butz, Stow and Roy
Weldon a? backs. Weldon as a punter has not
a superior on this coast. His kicks have al
ways been sure and accurate, and he will
greatly strengthen the team. The Olympics
have always been handicapped by not having
a fullliack that was a first-class kicker, but this
year this will all be obviated by the presence
of Welaon back of the line.
Last season the team had training quarters ;
a house was furnished them, and the men
were supplied with three meals per day.
This was expensive and the results were not
altogether satisfactory. This season it is pro
posed to simply furnish the men one mem.per
dayâ dinnerâ and do away with the house and
the breakfast and the iunch. The men can
then go to their peaceful homes and enjoy a
good night's rest. The noise, the trouble and
clothes that were stolen last season at the
Olympic training quarters kept the manage
ment in hot water continually.
I see by the papers that the Reliance team
cost its club $3200 last season, which is, by the
way, rather expensive. The Olympics cost
th%ir club something in the neighborhood of
$500, counting their trip to Butte and mci
dentals. This season by judicious manage
men t the team will probably come out pretty
nearly even. What tbe board should do is to
appropriate at its first meeting a sufficient sum
to put the team on a good sound basis. Games
will then be arranged with Reliance, Berkeley
and Stanford, and as ihe Indications are that
the public will patronize the game more than
ever this season the club stands a sood chance
of making money out of it. What the team
needs most is proper support and encourage
ment from the new board, and it will undoubt
edly receive it, as I understand the new
directors intend to liven up matters athletic
ally. Leonard Gill,
Manager Olympic Football Team.
Copies of the following letter have been
mailed to the amateur athletic clubs of
the coast :
San Francisco, Aug. 27, 1896.
To the Menders of Athletic Clubs on the Pacific
Coastâ Gentlemen: For the purpose of protect
ing amateur sports, particularly scientific box
ing, a meeting will be held to formulate some
plan of action, which meeting will talte place
at the rooms of the Manhattan Athletic Club,
1749 Mission street, corner of Erie, on Wednes
day evening, September 2.
The principal object of the meeting will be
â  to have advice from members of the different
clubs in regard to the license ($100) which is
exacted from cludb giving boxing exhibitions.
The license, of course, discourages athletic
sport, and if we can devise a way to avoid it
we will encourage the sport and give better
opportunities to the promising athletes of our
coast.
Hoping you will give this your earnest at
tention and consideration and that you will
be represented at the meeting, we remain
yours respectfully, "^
President Manhattan Athletic Club.
THE ANGLER.
Latest Reports From the Truckee
and Eel Riversâ Sonoma
Creek Trout.
Although several lovers of the angle
have put away their rods for the season,
the best of sport is now at hand, but suc
cess is guaranteed only to those who have
profited by experience. In some of the
coast streams trout-fishing is now first
class, but as the water is very clear and
low the trout are wary, and as a conse
quence the morning and evening fishing
are best.
Latest reports from the Big Sulphur
Creek, near Cloverdale, are favorable, and
good sport awaits the angler who under
stands the proper way of presenting a fly
or spoon to the denizens of the deep pools.
John Butler is in receipt of a letter from
Mr. Monroe of the Eel River which says
that first-class steelhead fishing is now in
order, but that the cream of the fishing
may be expected during tne latter part of
this month.
John Gallagher, the champion angler of
Oakland, will leave for the Eel in a few
days.
Excellent black-bass fishing is reported
from Duncans Mills. Mr. Morgan writes
that Charley Green and a party of friends
caught several bass in the Russian River
near Moscow Cottage recently that aver
aged in weight from two to five pounds.
Minnows and grasshoppers are the most
enticing baits for the lordly bass.
The attention of the Fish Commission
ers has been called to the fact that poach
ers are killing hundreds of bass in the
Four Clever Boxers Who Will Appear at the Colma dub

Russian River by means of giant powder.
It is presumed that arrests will follow.
The Truckee River is rapidly rounding
into form, and anglers who are conversant
with it and the peculiarities of the trout
are sanguine that grand sport will be en
joyed next month. Up to the present the
Truckee has not been a success, from an
angler's point of view, as the fishes have
been feeding on grubs and snails, which
were very prolific in the river owing to an
unexpected appearance of drifting moss
which evidently came from the dams that
were cleaned out this summer. The moss
is now rapidly decaying, and as a conse
quence anglers look forward to line fishing
in September. Among the anglers who
visited Boca during August for the pleas

Thomas Prendergast, a famous "var
mint' hunter and rattlesnake extermin
ator, writes from Glen Ellen to the sport
ing editor of The Call the following letter
joncerning the trout fishing enjoyed by
some of the local Waltonians on the
Sonoma Creek:
Cbarles Precht whipped the quiet pooli of
Sonoma Creek last Sunday above Glen Ellen
and returned early in the afternoon with a
fair basket. On his return to the Mervyn
Hotel at Glen Ellen he wÂ«s surrounded by
summer visitors who looked surprised at a
fine ness of steelheads that he displayed on
a large dish. The catch waÂ» made between
Kenwood and Glen Ellen.
"There was good sport along the creek." said
Precht. "I hooked a great many little fellows
that were game fish, and I threw tnem back
into the stream. The big ones gave me a hard
battle. I iost some of them on account of the
many snags in the deep pools."
Mrs. a Coppin and Mrs. John C. Liebert are
two very enthusiastic anglers. They leave the
Mervyn Hotel at Glen Ellen almost every
morning and return invariably with nice
messes of trout. One day they caught eleven
trout weighing four and a half pounds. The
League of the Cross Cadets have disturbed
Sonoma Creek in the vicinity of their camp so.
the fish are cautious for a short stretch, which
compels the anglers to go further up the
stream.
The Rev. James McDonald of St. Peter's
parish, who is visiting Glen Ellen, is delighted
with his success in the hills after game. He
uons the garb of a hunter and travels with his
favorite dog through brakes and canyons. The
hills are alive with doves and Father McDon
ald finds them out, with the result that he
brings many a bulging oag into camp. In ad
dition to doves he gathers in many Dlump
cottontails. To judge from appearances there
will be great sport in the hills around Glen
Ellen when the quail season opens, for one
comes across bevies ol quail repeatedly in a
short walk over the country in that neighbor
hood.
COURSING.
VaUey Queen Whelps a Big Litter
to Rossiter's Emm Pasha.
The sport of coursing that has taken
such a firm hold in the Middle and West
ern States is gradually growing in favor
in California, and each {succeeding meet
sees new faces on the field and increased
interest in the dogs.
Last Sunday's running at Ocean View
and lugleside brought out qeyenty-six
hounds, a showing for a single and regu
lar every-week meet that could hardly be
made by any city in the Union.
With increased interest and greater fa
cilities the sport can hardly fail to go to
the front and moroever remain there, for
it seems to be the rule that once a cours
ing man always one, and even though no
longer owners veterans of the field turn
out Sunday after Sunday to see the de
scendants of their old favorites run, and
tell of the days when they saw Fullerton or
even the great master McGrath run.
On Wednesday last J. J. Edmonds 1 game
campaigner, Valley Queen, whelped to J.
ttossiter's Emm Pasha ten as line pups as
ever saw the light of day. Five of the
pups are dogs, and already there is a great
scramble among coursing men for repre
sentatives of the litter. However, as Mr.
Edmonds makes a practice of never selling
any of his stock it is probable that, aside
I from the owners of the two dogs and a few
of their personal friends, the enthusiasts
will be disappointed.
This is Valley Queen's third litter since
her retirement from the turf, where she
made a record second to no dog that ever
chased a rabbit in California. From the
day she started as a sapling, six years ago,
up to the day that her owner decided that
her time for retirement had come she won
money â including many firsts â in every
stake in which she was entered. She is by
Stranger, a dog that never performed in
public, out of Jersey Lily, a splendidly
bred bitch. Stranger was bred by a well
known sporting man of Liyermore.
Rossiter's Emm Pasha is by imported
Major, out of imported -Daisy, and has
shown his quality by running* a number
of important stakes. He has a wonderful
turn of speed, ana the pups out of grand
old Valley Queen should be hard to beat,
both for speed and cleverness.
The accompanying illustration shows
Mr. Edmonds, who is one of the stanch
est friends of coursing on the coast and
who has done as much for the sport as any
follower of the leash now living. He is
holding by cords his brood bitches Valley
Queen and Vida Shaw, the latter being a
royally bred hound by Major Glendyne.
out of Lady Alice, and tracing her pedi
gree back to the great Master McGrath.
Tommy Brennan.the well-known trainer,
has just received from G. H. McDougallof
Butte, Montana, three splendidly bred
two-year-old hounds that he will pnt in
condition for this wint r's racing in the
parks and on the plains. The dogs are by
Royal Cr st, an Eastern dog well known
on this coast, out of Wasting Time, and
should prove great performers in the com
petent hands where they have been placed.
Mr. Brennan will also train Royal Time,
a Royal Crest-Dry Time pup belonging to
H. H. Devine, one of the best known cours
ing men of Sacramento.
The drawing for to-morrow's coursing at
Ineleside took place on Thursday evening
at Delta Hall, thirty-two well-known local
aogs being entered. First prize is $33.
Following is the result:
J. Woods' Mohawk vs. M. Traynor's Climax,
Cronin & McDonald's Rosa B vs. T. Brennon's
Gold King, D. Tweedies' Dublin Stout vs. S. C.
Cumjnings' Foxnall, Portal & Haggerty's El

Twenty-rive hounds are entered for to
morrow's coursing at Ocean View, and
some good sport should result. The $25
added by the management furnished live
prizes worth winning, and in consequence
J*J. EDMONDS and His Two Crack Greyhounds, Valley
Queen and Vida Shaw*
a number of crack dogs that have not
been seen on a coursing field for some
time were represented at the drawing that
too* place at Delta Hall last evening. The
last match in the run down, when Tom
Hayes and Captain Morse meet, should be
particularly interesting. Following is the
result of the drawing:
M. Tiernan's Flashlight vs. T. Cooney's Her

RIFLE AND RANGE.
A Number of Interesting Eventsfor
the Near Future.
The new rifle range and park of the San
Jose Turn Verein will be opened to-mor
row with a grand shooting festival and
picnic. Marksmen from all over the coast
have been invited to attend and many in
vitations have been accepted. San Fran
cisco clubs will be well represented. A
large number of cash and honorary prizes
will be contested for. When the train
from this City reaches San Jose, a little
after 9 o'clocK in the morning, the visitors
will be met at the depot by the Turners
in full uniform and escorted through the
principal streets to the park. The Turn
ers of San Francisco will go to the Garden
City in full uniform. The shooting will
last two days, to-morrow and Monday.
On Monday evening tnere will be the dis
tribution of prizes followed by a grand
ball.
The Eintracht, San Francisco Turn
Verein and the Deutschen Krieger shoot
ing sections of San Francisco are prepar
ing for a big joint picnic and prize shoot
ing festival, to be held in Schuetzen Park,
near San Rafael, on the first Sunday in
October. On Monday night representa
tives of the three organizations met and
made the preliminary arrangements for
the event.
In order to carry on the work system
atically, they formally organized with the
following officers and committees:
Robert Wieneke president, F. Attinger
vice-president, O. Burmeister secretary,
Captain F. Kuhls treasurer. Press com
mittee â 0. Burmeister, F. Kaiser. Shoot
ing committeeâ Captain Kuhls, Captain
Attinger, Captain Wieneke. Music com

Maritzen. Park and railroad committee â
Captain F. Kubls, Joe Straub, C. Maritzen.
Committee for bowling alleyâ J. Young,
C. Rudolph, A. Franke. Raffle com
mittee â L. Schmidt, J. Straub, F. Kaiser.
It was decided to offer a large number
of valuable honorary prizes. At present
all of the events have not been decided
upon. An invitation will be extenJed to
ail rifle clubs and marksmen to attend the
shooting festival and merrymaking.
For several days past Captain Siebe of
Shell Mound has been putting the rifle
range in order for the thirty-eiehth an
nual festival of the San Francisco Schuet
zez Verein, which will be held on Sunday,
September 6. About $400 in cash will be
shot for, The usual range rules will gov
ern. On the point target there will be
20 cash prizes, from $25 to $2. for the best
centers, and 20 prizes, from $25 to $2, for
the most points. Besides these $60 will
be divided into 15 cash premiums, from
$12 to $1, for the most red flags in 30 shots ;
tickets, $5, unlimited. Ties will be de
cided by the most blue Hags. The distri
bution of prizes will be held on Thursday
evening, September 10, at California Hall,
620 Bush street. The distribution will be
followed by a social.
On Thursday evening at the California
Schuetzen Club's distribution of prizes
the question of superiority among the
champions arose, and the subject nar
rowed down to the qualifications of A.
Strecker and D. W. McLaughlin. This
question will be decided on the third Sun
day in September, when these two marks
men will shoot a 100-shot match for $20 a
side. The match is looked forward to
with great interest by local marksmen,
and some interest in the event wiil surely
be felt by Eastern riflemen, to whom
Strecker and McLaughlin are known per
sonally and by reputation.
California is noted all over the United
States, and in fact all over the world, for
the number of her expert marksmen who !
have won honors and prizes on every range
and under every sun. Tnis is not to be
wondered at considering the large number
of riflemen in the State, and particularly
in and around San Francisco. Within the
past few months interest in rifle and re
volver practice has been increasing and
the local clubs' membership rolls are con
stantly growing larger. In the interior of
the State this interest has been marked by
a number of new clubs springing into life.
These clubs it seems are being lormed by
the younger generation, guided to some
extent by the older marksmen, men who
have "seen their best days" as rifle and
pistol shot 3. The young marksmen, how
ever, desire modern methods and ideas for
their guidance, ns indicated by several let
ters of inquiry that huve come to hand.
These inquiries are for information as to
how to construct rifle ranges, targets the
best firearms, both large and small 'and
tne best ammunition and the methods of
loading the same.
Lack of time has prevented the answer
ing of all of these letters at length, but a
few suggestions can be made here that
will place many of these inquirers in the
right direction for obtaining the informa
tion they desire. There are several well
written works on rifle and revolver shoot
ing and the proper firearms to select for
special purposes. Two are by A. C. Goukt
of 293 Broadway, New York, entitled "The
Rifle" and "The Pistol." Mr. Gould is
recognized all over the world as an author
ity on all such subjects. The "Ideal Hand-
Book" and the Stevens Company's book
on these matters also contain much valu
able information. The two latter are for
warded gratis.
One of tbe worst difficulties for young
marksmen to overcome in either rifle or
pistol shooting is "flinching." Many
older men, too, aro afflicted in the same
way, but they will not acknowledge it. It
is not that they are "powder shy." It is
unconscious nervousness. The question
bas been frequently asked, How can flinch
ing be overcome? It is simple enough.
Practice with an empty gun. An old one
is the best, as it is not necessary to spoil a
good firearm by constant snapping.
Aim an empty revolver or rifle at some
small object on the wall of your room or
on an adjoining building and pull the
tneger steadily until the hammer falls.
Your very first efforts will clearly proye
that you flinch, but a few efforts will over
come this fault. Even after the flinching
habit is overcome, the practice is good for
it steadies the nerves and it is just as good
for the beginner as actual shooting. F.re a
thousand shots a week, so to speak, in
this way, and when on the range the shy
ness first felt disappears when powder and
Du4!ets are actually used. Some of tbe

THE GUN
Crouse and Mountain Quail Shoot
ingâlnanimate Targets.
The Pacific Tournament Association
will meet to-morrow at the shooting
grounds, Alameda Junction, where inani
mate targets will be used.
On September 6 the California Wing
Club will shoot at San Bruno; September
9 the Fresno Gun Club will hold a tourna
ment at Fresno, and on the same day the
Reliance Gun Club of Oakland will have a
free-for-all shoot at its grounds in Ala
meda. September 13 the Olympic Gun
Ciub will meet at Alameda Point, and on
the 19th the Alameda;County Sportsmen's
Club will hold a snoot at Alameda Junc
tion. On the 20th the Golden State Gun
Club will smash clays at Alameda Point,
while the Reliance Gun Club will bold
forth at the Webster-street grounds.
Sportsmen will be pleased to learn that
occasionally a Deputy Fish Commissioner
pays some attenaion to the game inter
ests. Recently John H. Sammi, a popular
sportsman, received at his place of busi
ness on Sacramento street a bunch of
grouse from a friend who is enjoying a va
cation in tbe mountains. As a messenger
boy was on his way to Mr. Sammi's resi
dence with the game in question a Deputy
Fish Commissioner intercepted him on
Davis street and inquired of the boy
where he was going with the "quail."
The lad at first reiused to be interviewed
but when the deputy displayed his badge
an answer quickly followed which was
not sa.isfactory to the game warden, who
marched tbe boy to the headquarters oi
tne Fish Commission, which is in the
Flood building. Chief Deputy Babcock
explained to his assistant that the birds
which the messenger-boy had in his pos
session were grouse, and that the season
when those birds can be lawfully killed
opened on t^e 15th mst. and will close on
February 15.
The deputy proved, however, that he
had an eye out for business, and in case
the messenger-boy had been engaged by a
commission-house to deliver the birds to a
purchaser the evidence of conviction wouid
be sufneient â that is according to an act
relating to the sale of grouse, which reads
as follows:
Every cold-storage company, and every per
son keeping a cold-storage warehouse, tavern,
hotel, restaurant or eating-house, and every
marketman or other person who shall buy,
sell, expose or offer for sale, in this State, any
quail, bob-white, partridge, grouse, dove or
wiW dnck, whether taken or Killed In the state
of California, or shipped into the State from
any other state, Territory or foreign country,
except between the fifteenth day of Xovembtr
and the fifteenth day of January of the follow
ing year, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
But there is another section of the game
law that refers specially to cold-storage
hotel-keepers and marketmen which some
what tangles up the meaning of tbe law,
that is, so far as the season for the sale of
grouse is concerned, and it is as follows:
Every cold-storage company, person keep
ing afcold-storage warehouse, tavern or hotei
fceeper, restaurant or eating-house keeper,
marketman or other person, who shall buy,
sell, expose or offer for sale, or give away, or
have in his possession in this State, any q'uaii,
bob-white, partridge, pheasant, grouse, dove
or wild duck, during the time it shall be un
lawful to kill such birds, vrhetner taken or
killed in the State of California, or snipped
into the State from any other State. Territory
or foreign country, shall be guilty of a misde
meanor.
It will be noticed that in this section
the words, "during the time it shall be
unlawful to kill such birds", would infer
that grouse can be sold now, as the grouse
season opened on the 15th inst. Evidently
the game law is in a very tangled up state
and it is no wonder that Judges and jurors
are puzzled when they are called upon to
decide questions which the framers of the
law are themselves unable to answer.
Mr. Sammi got the birds all right, but
he had to pay tbe messenger 70 cents over
time, a bill for which he proposes forward
ing to the honorable Board of Fish Com
mfssioners â Messrs. Emenc, Murdoch,
Morrison and Babcock.
Billy Murdock of tbe Lincoln Gun Club
has built a very comfortable naming ark,
which will be anchored in Midshipmans
slough* Sonoma marshes, during the duck
shooting season. Murdock will have as
his snooting companions two members of
the Lincoln Gun Club.
Donald McÃae is making very extensive
preparations for the duck-shooting season
in the Suisun marshes. He has engaged
one of the most commodious and comforta
ble arks on the bay for the season and wiJl
be glad to have many visits from his j
friends and sportsmen when the season j
opens. There are sleeping compartments i
in the ark for ten persons and it goes with- !
out saying that every "bunk" will have a
hunter on the opening day of the season.
McÃae is thoroughly conversant with the
best shooting ponds'of the Suisun marshes.
Cliff WiegeLwho returned recently from
the McCioud River says tbat trout tisning
is good and that durlns his outing in tne
mountains with Sam Esiman eleven deer
were killed and one large brown bear.
THE OARSMEN
Clubmen Are In Readiness for the
Great Stockton Regatta.
The past week has been an exceptionally
busy one in local boating circles arranging
for the great rowing regatta to be held at
Stockton on Admission day.
The oarsmen, who have been faithfully
training for the affair for two months, are
now In the pink of condition.
The training next week will consist of i
try-out race* each evening.
The races on the 9th should not be of 'â 
'.lie funeral procession order, as the time j
of nearly every single-sculler, outrigger
ykiff oarsman * and barge crew now in
training lias been caught during practice
*pins over the course, and in each in
stance the time taken-ahowed that all the
local oarsmen are very eVenly matched.
At Stockton the oarsmen are training
faithfully, and according to Gus Grant, [
the genial secretary of the Stockton Ath- i
letic Association," who is in town, the ,
Stockton people will be greatly disap
pointed if they fail to win both the junior
and senior barge races.
The entries in the different races will i
be as follows:
Pioneer Club, senior crewâ Fred Orr, bow
and captain; Coney Ochs, forward waist;
George Collopy, aiierwaist; John Clifford,
stroke, and George Fitzsimmons, coxswain.
Junior Crew â Dick Collopy, bow and cap
tain; Thomas Faulkner, iorwardwaist: Phil
Tui'-hs, after waist; William St. John, stroke,
and Georze Fitzsimmons, coxswain.
The Pioneers will make no entries in i
the shell races or outrigger skiff events, I
owing to the lack of suitable boats.
Entries from the Ariel Rowing Club
will be as follows: William McCansland, j
the junior champion single sculler, in j
the senior single-scull event; Frank Wil- i
son in the junior outrigger skiff race, and ;
Jim Wilson and George Pnelan will row i
under the club's colors in the senior out- !
rigger skiff event. Andy Carroll, who !
has so long and successfully acted as the
club's coxswain, will row for the club in
the junior single-scull event. He has
bought McCausland' soldi shell, and,
although he is little more than a boy,
he is looked upon as the worthy opponent
of any of his competitors.
The Dolphin Club will enter William
Patch in the junior outrigger skiff race, !
Jack Caughlin in the senior outrigger j
event and Thomas Keenan inÂ» the junior
single shell.
Caughlin is in great form. From 200 \
pounds he has trained down to 185. He j
succeeded the other evening in leading j
the speedy . South End junior crew from
the foot of Third street around the sugar
house buoy and return, a distance of three j
miles.
From the South End Club the following I
will row at Stockton :
Senior crewâ Henry Bode, bow; Bob Mc-
Arthur, forwardwaisi end captain; Gus Car
son, afterwaist; Frank Daplissea, stroke;
George McGrill, cockswain.
Junior erew â Joe Foley, bow and captain ; G.
Fox, forwardwaist; Hugh afterwaist;
Tim Fitzpatrick, stroke; George McGrill, cock
swain.
. Intermediate crewâ Ed Tobin, bow and cap
tain; Matt Breen. forward waist; James Pallas,
afterwaist; Ed Scully, stroke; George McGrill,
cockswain.
Junior shellâ Foley, and probaoly Mc-
Arthur and Charles Cutter. ' In the senior
shell race, Frank Dnplissea, the coast champion,
â¢will row.
The South Ends would also make an
entry in the outrigger skiff events, but
their boats will not be completed in time \
for the regatta, owing to the late arrival |
of some of the building material from the
East. The club's junior crew, which is
made up of comparatively new men, is j
improving wonderfully under the tuition j
of William Thomas, the coach of the club.
The entries from the Alameda Club will
be decided upon Sunday, when try-out <
races will be held on the estuary, and the i
winners of first and second places wiil rep
resent the club in the Stockton regatta.
Those that will row in the try-out -races
will be: S. J. Pembroke, Dr. Cecil Dennis,
Fred Avers, A. Webb, Victor Hadcock
and Charles Hansen.
An entry will also be made from the
University Boat Club." William Cole will
represent them in the junior outrigger
skill race of the regatta, and he is now in
regular training from the South End boat
house.
Stockton will in all probability be rep
resented in four events as follows:
Senior bargeâ Tom Carkeek, bow and cap
tain; Charles Spencer, forwardwaist; Denny
Chapman, afterwaist; Carl Davis, stroke, and
Will Dolan, cockswain.
Junior bargeâ John Perrott, bow and cap
tain; F. Butler, forwardwaist; Al Brown, aft
erwaist; Harry Swift, stroke, and Will Dolan,
cockswain.
The intermediate crew will probably be: W.
Bates, James Burns, John Suva and . George
Brownfleld, and James Linn will row in the ju
nior single scull event.
A most unfortunate accident befell
young Frank Duplissea of the South End
Club while out rowing last evening and by
it he may be unable to enter the regatta.
He was having a trial with Gus Carson,
who was rowing a wherry, and while rac
ing down Mission Creek at a terrific pace
he ran into a small skiff which suddenly
darted out in front of him. :
The shell in which he was rowing and
the one he was .to use at Stockton was
damaged almost beyond repair.
At a meeting of the South End Club
held the other evening Al Fritz and John
D. Maboney were appointed to secure
transportation accommodations for South
End members. John D. Mahoney was
elected as the Soath End judge of the re
gatta and Edward P. Shorthall was given
John Lenahan's position as j club delegate
to the P. A. A.

LAWN TENNIS.
Annual Doubles and Ladles' Singles
Championship Tournament to
Be Held September 8.
The long-expected boom in tennis now
seems to have somewhat materialized in
the shape of the annual doubles and
ladies' singles championsnip tournament,
which will be heid at tbe Hotel del Monte
this year under the most auspicious cir
cumstances. This will be a marked
departure from previous tournaments, as
heretofore they have all without exception
been held at San Rafael since the years of
1888 and 188y, when Del Monte was the
favored spot.
Old-time devotees of the game will
readily recall the tournament of the latter
year, when W. H. Taylor so easily proved
his superiority at the time, and also the
winning of the first annual double cham
pionsnip by Messrs. Tobin and McGavip.
Unusual enthusiasm is being shown in
preparation for this event, and the courts
of the California Club are crowded daily
by players in faithful training.
Whitney and Whitney are the favorites
at present by a slight victory over Hardy
and Driscoli last week, but the ultimate
result is most uncertain, as so many teams
of new players have come to the front so
rapidly, anione these being Weihe and
Suyda'm, and Eckart and Upham and Al
lison and Allen, all of the California Club;
Dr. Decker and Dr. Rothganger of the
United States navy.
From Oakland comes the news of
some very strong teams, Hardy and Dris
coli and W. and T. Magee being closely
matched. Randsome and Kinzie, the
former player being also prominent in

football as captain of the Berkeley
football team, and several others are also
heard of.
The ladies' tournament will also show
an increased entry list, and Miss Jones of
rtanta Monica will undoubtedly enter the
lists with the hope of ultimately wresting
tne championship from Miss Bee
Hooper of St. Heiena, who has held the
same for three years, but so nearly lost it
last year to Miss Jonea at San Rafael.
Tbe outlook for a brilliant tournament is
most promising, and preparations are in
rapid progress. September 8 and 9 are the
dates set. Following is the official an
nouncement:
The seventh annual championship tourna
ment of the Pacific States Lawu Teunis Asso
ciation for ladies' singles and gentlemen's

tinuing September 9, under the auspices of
the United States National Lawa Tennis As
sociation.
Miss Bee Hooper, the present lady cnam
pion, will be called upon to defend her title
against the winner of the all-comers in the
ladies' singles. Messrs. Hardy and Hardy, the
present doubles champions, wiil be called upon
to defend their title against the winners of the

YACHTING.
Preparations for a Bij? Regatta and
for Minor Cruises.
Local yachtsmen are evincing an ani
mated interest in the interclub regatta, to
be held on the bay on Admission day, and
judging from the activity and enthusiasm
that the amateur Jack Tars are showing
over the affair it wiil be a great success.
A regatta committee, consisting of the
following, was appointed to arrange the
details of the race: Charies G. Yale of the
San Francisco Yacht Club, Alec Swanson
of the Pacific Yacht Club, \V. A. Barlage
of tbe Corinthian Yacht Club, H. Lands
berger of the Encinal Yacht Club and M.
Cam bell of the California Yacht Club.
It has been decided to hold the races
over the channel course. A large entry
list is anticipated, and yachts are now be
ing thoroughly overhauled for the occa
sion.
On September 25 the Encinal Yacht Ciub
will hold a club smoker, when the yacht
Fawn, which is at present owned by a syn
dicate and which defeated the speedy
Catherine for tne perpetual challenge cup,
will be sold at auction.

HANDBALL.
Interesting Letter From Champion
Jones of Australia.
John Jones, the champion of Australia,
who loft here several months ago for Syd
new, N. S. W., has written an interesting
letter to a friend in this City. In it he
says: "I have got a big match on with
Oughton, a Newcastle man. lie chal
lenged me in the Newcastle paper, and as
soon as my backer, Mr. O'Farrell, saw it,
ne accepted it at once on the conditions
mentioned by him, the stake to be Â£100. A
reply was promptly sent to Oughton and
Â£10 was posted in the hands of tbe editor
of the Referee, Sydney, the rest of the
money to be put in the hands of the stake
holder the day before the match.
"The conditions of the game are 51
points, to be played in Newcastle wi:n
the rubber ball on September 12, and 51
points to be played in Sydney on Sep
tember 25 with the hard ball. Both scores
will be added together, and the man that
scores the most will win the match.
''There is great excitement here as to
who will win the match, and several bets
arc being made about town. I will send
yon all particulars of how tbe matcn goes.
I have never seen Oughton, but I am told
be is a wonder with the rubber ball, and
plays very well with tne hard balL
'â We had an interesting game ; ere which
I know you would have liked to see. It
bad to be kept private. The contestants
were two ladies. Miss Katie Cooper, one
of my pupils, played another young lady,
Miss Nellie Sweeney. The way they played
surprised the few who were present. The
game was the first fifteen aces, and Miss
Cooper won alter a close game by the score
15 to 10. Mias Cooper will play any lady
handball player in the world, and you can
put that in your paper."
A number of good games have been ar
ranged for to-morrow in the local courts.
At the San Francisco court the following
games will be played:
J. Lawless and D. Connelly against P. Hutch

McGrath and Daly of the Eureka court,
on Eighteenth street, and two plsyers
from his court, and it may come off to
morrow afternoon. McGrath and Daly
claim the championship of the Mission
and issued a challenge last Sunday to
play any two players for the amateur
championship of tbe coast.
FOOTBALL.
Stanford and Barkeley Prospects
a Standoffâ Olympic and Ra-
liance Promising.
Football prosDects with tne various clubs
are beginning to assume tangible shape,
and the practice season with all of them
will open within tbe next three weeks.
Stanford and the University of California,
each with six vacancies to fill on the team,
will start so nearly upon an equal footing
that should there be no great advantage
for either in new men another Thanksgiv
ing tie may be the result.
It promises now to be a contest between
Stanford's powerful line and Ranso rue's
remarkable punting for Berkeley. Stan
ford's plan will probably be to strengthen
her heavy center and rely upon the ex
perience and force of the men in that po
sition to break down the less experienced
Berkeley defense and prevent, if possible,
the effectiveness of Ransome's kicks.
To this end a suggestion has been made
by ex-Captain Downing of the Stanford
team, wno will help coach tbe Palo Alto
men. His idea is to play Cotton, who
weighs over 180 pounds, at quarter, in
order to fortify the center with heavy
backing. This was Camp's plan last sea
son and in 1894, wnen be wanted Downing
himself to train for quarter. He said it â 
was all a mistake to suppose that quarter
must be a small man; quickness was the
chief requisite.
â \Vith the exception of Anderson, a half
back from the Oakland High School,
Berkeley has no men of known football
ability in the new fresnman class, but
there is some likely looking heavy mate
rial that may develop into just such men
as are most needed for the Varsity line.
An upper class man from the University
of Chicago, where he was a substitute, is
an addition to tbe large list of candidates
.'or back-of-the-line positions. Stanfordis
possibly more fortunate in getting new
men. No less than eight prospective fresh
men of more or less inflated reputation j
are reported from different parts of the i
coast.
The Olympics should have a team of
club champions with the material in sight.
Their prospects are the best in years.
Nearly all of last season's players will be
in the field and in addition there are such
men as Code, quarter, and Weldon, full
bacir, two old Stanford players. Frank
enheimer, Stanford's veteran halfback,
now a student in Cooper Medical College,
can hardly refrain from playing football,
and as toe trip from here to the Reliance
grounds occupies three Hours it is thought
tbat he will rind the Olympic team more
convenient for his favorite sport.
Manager Giil has received a letter from
Douglas, tackle last season for Berkeley.
He wants to give up his work at Angels
Camp and get employment in this City,
and will if he comes here try for the
Olympic team, though it already has Sex
ton and Porter for tackles. Madtfen, end
for Olympic last season, is going to Stan
ford, and his old position is to be tried for
by Sherman Stow of Santa Barbara, who
was injured and handicapped in practice
for the Berkeley team last year.
The Reliance Club has good material,
but some of it is in doubt. Walton, elected
captain Thursday night, has not yet ac
cepted, nor will he during the next few
days of uncertainty attached to the ques
tion of his future employment. On the
first of the month his present position
with a bicycle company la this City will
become vacant.
If the Reliance Club members can secure
him employment somewhere he will play,
buthe is not at all eager to go into the
game again, for be declares mat he has
had enougb and thinks that after a man
leaves college he should let football alone.
Middlemas, mentioned in one of the
morning papers as a Reliance possibility,
will not leave the Olympics, so Captain
Smith and Manager Gill positively as
serted yesterday. Frankmheimer, another
prospect, is doubttul. Harrelson, the old
Stanford quarter, will, it is believed, piay
quarter for Reliance. Sherman, the
Berkeley end, will also play. And in ad
dition to the well-known old players and
such other new ones as were mentioned in
these columns last week Reliance will
have Wagner, guard on the Cornell Varsity
for the last turee seasons. He is now in
Los Angeles, but hopes soon to come to
Oakland. He is a bijr. powerful man 'and
has faced all the >- : t puards of the East.
BASEBALL.
Oaklands Have Strengthened Their
Team and Will Meet Imperials
To- Morrow.
Following is the make-up of the two
teams that will play at the Sixteenth and
Folsom street ball grounds to-morrow :
Imperials. Positions. Oaklands.
Warri... ..Catcher Hardie
Joe McCarthy Pitcher she%
Wilds First base Donavan
Creamer Second base Walters
Miller Third base Pequlgney
TUlson Shortstop Arlett
Crowiey K.ght n>ld KeacinÂ«
J. Nealon Center field DavU
John McCarthy Left field Agnew
The San Franciscos have apparently as
sumed the position of popular favorites.
They have many crack players in the
team. Iberg and Cooney are two skillful
pitchers. Cooney seems to be regaining
his form of late. Pete Sweeney, the old
time favorite, seems to be more than hold
ing his own at third base, scarcely a Sun
day passing by without his making a sen
sational play.
Captain Donovan of the Oaklands will
j^iay his old position at first baw to-mor
ow. His ankle has entirely recovered.
Lou Hardie will, in the future, do the
catching for the Oakland?.
Manager Roberts of the Imperials has
materially strengthened his team since
the last game and there shouid be a lively
contest with the Oaklands. He has sipned
as^ catcher Matt Stanley of the Fort
Worths of the Texas League.
In a game of baseball played in Oakland
last Sunday between the Pioneers and the
Grove Btreets, the Pioneers won, with the
following score :
Grove Streets 0 0 0 2 11 0â 4
Pioneers 5 710 211 1 â¢â 36
Batteriesâ Pioneers, Jury and Whimes; Grove
Streets, Britton and Croniu.
The Pioneers wish to play ou their
grounds in Oakland any team under 19
years of age, and will receive communica
tions addressed to 817 Oak street, Oakland.
There will be a game at the Presidio
grounds to-morrow between the Famous
team of Oakland and the Osobrightg of
San Francisco.
CRICKET CHIRPS.
Abandonment or the California-
Australian Match.
In spite of the untiring efforts of a spe
cially appointed committee the contem
plated match with the Australian eleven
will not come off. This regrettable result
is due to the large number of Eastern fix
tures made by the visitors, which limited
the one or two dates still at their disposal
to midweek days. Anything but a Satur
day and Sunday match in San Francisco
would, even if the necessary team could
be got together, be a sure financial failure,
so the project was abandoned judiciously-
There was great excitement shown by
the Portland people in the All-Oregon vs.
The Next Eighteen match, played at the
Multnomah grounds last Saturday. The
All-Oregon team was made up oi candi
dates for the representative State team
that will go to Vancouver for the forth
coming carnival. It was captained by
Charley Lawrence. Tbe match was as
close as possible, being won by the eleven
by just one run amid the wildest enthu
siasm on the part of the attending crowds.
Tde Penryn Club team is making ar
rangements for a fall tour that will in
clude Lake County and possibly Bakers
field. They will make a stay iv this City
long enough to meet the several ciubs of
tbe association.
The final Anglo-Australian match,
finished at the oval on the 12th inst., re
sulted in a win for England by 66 runs.
This makes the twelfth inter-country
match that the Britishers have won since
1880 on their own ground. Tbe Austra
lians have won three and four have been
drawn.
The order of the first-class counties to
date is as follows: Yorkshire, Lancashire,
Surrey, Mi Idlesex, Essex. Surrey has just
defeated Kent by ten wickets and Glouces
tershire worsted Notts by 307. Sewell of
the conquering team made 104.
The local cup matches for to-morrow
are Alameda vs. Pacifies at Alameda and
Bohemias vs. Californias at Golden Gate.
Umpiee.
Bay Fishing.
The Call's Sausalito correspondent
sends the following report of catches
made during the past week:
Bay fishing has been good during the past
week, although the tides have not been favor
able. We have now passed the last heavy
spring tides for the season, and the best salt
water fishing In the bay is to commence and
will continue until the heavy rains lall. The
summer winds are about to cease, while the
water being at its greatest degree of saltness,
the larger fish which frequent the ocean
shores are coming into the bay in pursuit of
smelt, sardines and other email iisf., their nat
ural iood.
On Monday last Thomas Brennin, the well
known angler, with two companions, caught
eighty-three pounds of red and blue rockfish
at Point Cavulo. the largest a biue rocKcod
weighing 3}Â£ pounds.
On Tuesday Joseph Hawkins and friend
caught a large string of red rockcod and one
eleven-pound green codfish ac Lime Point fog
whistle.
Smelt have been more plentiful during the
week and some good catches have been made
near Sausalito, but the largest have been
caught at Target Bock Dear Belvedere. On
Sunday last Al Thomsen and friend caught
115 of these fish in a lew hours.
BELASCO'S ABSENT WIFE
The Actor â¢ Manager Seeks a
Divorce From His Missing
Spouse.
Married Threa Years, Daring Two of
Which the Conple Have Been
Separated.
Frederick Belasco, actor, playwright, in
structor in histrionics and manager of the
Alcazar Theater, has sued his wife, Grace
Belasco, for divorce. Belasco's real name
is Isaacs and it was under this rathercom
roon cognomen that he was married, and
consequently under this that he sought a
separation. As a result, the fact of the filing
of the suit has only recently become pub
lic.
Toe Belascos have only been married
three years, having been joined in wed
lock in Wisconsin in 1593 while both were
members of a traveling company. They
lived together only a year, when Mrs.
Beiasco went to New Ifork and left her
husband here. Hence the suit for divorce
on the charge of desertion.
Frederick Beiasco is a brother of Davi 1
Beiasco who gained fame as a playwright
and subsequently as the athletic instructor
of Mrs. Leslie Carter, for whose tuition as
an accress he secured $25,000 from N. K.
Fairbanks, the Chicago millionaire.
The local Beiasco is a well known andl
clever actor and has for some time con-l
ducted a school of acting in San Francisco. l
Recently he assumed charge of the Alcazar, l
which resort is to be reopened underliisl
management in a short tiiae^^H

An adjournment was taken until next
Tuesday. At that time a decision may be
reached for an adjournment sine die. The

Tne Grand Jury is advised that a
scheme has been devised for the re
occupation of Morton street by dissolute
women immediately on the final adjourn
ment of tais jury. Chief Crowiey is
aware oi' tbe fact that a man calling him
self an attorney recently collected money
from t^ie expelled tenants on the repre
sentation tliat lie cculd reopen the houses
lor tbe purposes for which the apartments
were formerly used. A petition to reopen
tbe houses was recently "signed by several
iirms on Grant avenue. Members of the
Grand Jury are positive that a scheme haÂ»
been concocted to restore the banished
tenants.

PREPARING TO RESIST,
The Board of Health Will
Have Legal Trouble Over
Chinatown.
Tenants and Property- Owners Are
A'ready Consulting Their
â¢ Attorneys.
The indications are that the Board of
Health will have a healthy job on its
hands before it succeeds in ousting the
tenants of the Chinese dens that were re
rently condemned as unfit for human hab
itation.
The ten days that were given those who
live in the hovels that were first placed
under the ban have elapsed, but tbe board
has taken no steps to enforce its orders,
probably because rumors have reached tbe
members that at the first move toward on
eviction injunctions will be taken out to
prevent such procedure.
The first direct intimation that legal re
sistance was intended came yesterday,
when a communication was received at
the Health Office from M. Schuppert, who
owns the building at 832 Jacsson street,
protesting against the condemnation of
his property.
The document from its form and legal
phraseology was evidently made up by an
attorney and appears to bÂ« intended as a
foundation for court proceedings in case
the building is torn down. The Chinese
tenants as well as the owners of the prop
erty they occupy, are getting nervous over
tbe condemnations and are preparing for
a legal battle.
Those wbolive in the lodging-houses ap
parently do not care about the edict of the
ooard, but a number of merchants whose
places of business have been condemned
are worried and have already consulted
attorneys. A number of them called on
Attorney John Sullivan yesterday and
asked him to interpose should the attempt
be made to drive them from the reeking
structures they now occupy.
Health Inspector Kinne will soon have
a new lot of buildings to recommend for
condemnation.
Sirs. Hume Injured.
Mrs. Hugh Hume was oat driving yesterday
and was thrown from her buggy, sustaining
the fracture of several ribs. At last accounts
sne was resting easily. Mrs. Hume is the
niece of Mrs. Volney Spalding.

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 28.â Stocks to-day
showed some slight improvements both in volume
of business and in price. The transactions in
stocks aggregated 130,764 shares, an. ; in railway
and ' miscellaneous mortgages $927,000. These
totals in ordinary times would be considered of
insignificant proportions, but they make quite a
comparison with the dealings on previous days of
the week ' and gave the broken hope for better
things. The influx of gold was the dominating
influence, the engagements since the import move
ment started about ten days ago footing up nearly
$12,000,000. Better still, the foreign exchanges
are demoralized and everything points to a con
tinuance of the movement of the yellow metal
â  from Europe.
Discounts in the open market In London. it is
true, have been advanced, and the Bank of Eng
land has raised the price for bar gold, but this has
been offset by a further reduction in posted rates !
for foreign exchange. To-day sixty-day bills were i
quoted at $4 82% and demand $4 85, against
$4 83% and $4 85 yesterday. Actual business.
however, in transacted at $4 81% and $4 82% for
bankers' sixty days and $4 83V-2@4 83% for de
mand, the lowest touched since the current down
ward movement set in. Predictions of lower
rates for money next week were current and they
seem to have some basis. To-day the rates
ranged from 6to 10 per cent, but the bulk of the
business was transacted at 7 per cent and under.
With gold coming ibis way and money less
stringent ODerators were inclined to branch out a
little on the long side of . the account, while the
bears were disposed to cover their short lines.
London also took more interest in our mar
ket and bought &U Paul and Louis
ville and Nashville. The advance in the
general list was equal to i/i@'i% per cent, Jer
sey Central, Manhattan, Western Union, the In
dustrials, the Grangers and the Internationals lead
ing. : The Grangers were strencthed by the unex
pectedly good showing of the Burlington and
Quucy for July. For the period named the com
pany reports a surplus of $93,323, against a de
ficit $10,360 In 1895. "* â¢ t

CHICAGO, Iv. t Aug. 28.â A cable from Bnda-
Pesth giving the Austria-Hungarian Agricultural
Minister's estimate of the world's crop of wheat
and rye led In interest and importance in the
wheat market this.moming. The estimates made
the crop of wheat approximately 140,000,000
bushels less than in 1895, and of rye 160,000,000
bushels less. Before the market : opened prices
were already up almost a cent from yesterday's
close, but that premium was thought to be suffi
cient acknowledgment of the figures mentioned,
for only insignificant advances succeeded the
opening, and before the morning hours had ex
pired the tone wavered and prices gradually
dropped lower. â  â  Receipts at Chicago were 170
cars, and 279.987 bushels were . withdrawn from
store. The Northwest received 634 cars, against
488 last Friday and 713 a year ago.
Liverpool cables were i^d higher. The strength
revived on a published statement by the Liverpool
Corn Trade News that >.urope will require from
America 3,200,000 bushels of wheat weekly from
now until the end â of December. Following this
sales of 300,000 bushels in this market for direct
export and seaboard clearances of 613,906 bushels
further stimulated buying and material advances
resulted. Paris cables were 15 i entimes lower to
65 higher for flour and '20 centimes higher to 10
centimes lower for wheat. Antwerp was un
changed and Berlin %to 1% marks lower. De
cember wheat opened from i>9ysc to 60ygC. sold
between 59% c and 60% c, closing at 60^(0.60 "g (i >
iy2@l%c higher than yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 175 cars. >
CORN â The io v price of corn, without reference
to the conditions causing it. seems to be the main
boll argument in this market. Many influential
traders buy on the theory that they certainly can
not lose much, while they stand to win something.
The strength or wheat helped prices of corn this
nrorning, but the subseauent cooling of the bull
enthusiasm permitted them to sag. Receipts were
528 cars, 177 less than estimated, and 624.132
bushels were withdrawn from store. Liverpool
cab.es were quiet and steady. Ultimately corn
became firmer with wheat. Export clearan-es
were 227,876 bushels. May corn opened at 253/ c,
advanced to 25% c, where It closed, s/ 8 c higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row, 600 cars.
OATSâ Firmness, Independent of the tone of
wheat and corn, was still the notable characteris
tic of oats. Of course, there was a certain amount
of speculative sympathy which checked the ad
vancing tendency early, but nevertheless the un
dertone of strength was distinct and well defined.
Receipts were 369 cars, and 108,709 bushels were
taken from store. Prices rallied with those of
wheat later In the session. Export clearances
aggregated 167.575 bushels. May oats closed 3/ 8 c
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow, 330 cars.
FLAX -Was weaker. Cash. 65%@66c; Septem
ber. 65 %@d 6c ; December, 7Oc Receipts were 97
cars.
PROVISIONSâ An irregular hog market with
some grades steady and others weak was reported
at the yards this morning. The latter feeling car
ried the most weight at the opening of the provis
ion market, but. the demand for product became
better as the session progressed and a steadier
tone developed. The early strength of wheat was
a benefit as an influence. January pork closed
12% c higher. January lard 5c higher and January
ribs 7 %c higher.
BUTTERâ The butter market was steady to
day, the extreme firmness having disappeared.
Extra grades were still In good demand, but other
sorts were Inclined to drag.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 28.â R. G. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow In their weekly review of trade:
Failures for the week have been 288 in the United
States, against 186 last year, and 33 In Canada,
against 42 last year. Clearing-house certificates
have not been issued, but Instead gold is coming
hither largely on the swiftest steamers, about
$10,000,000 being already on the way. Higher
lending raes bring It, notwithstanding foreign
events which disturb London markets and grow
ing (onfidnce in the monetary future of the
country helps. The shrinkage of merchandise
Imports and the Increase of exports also help.
These tendencies all help to lessen the strain.
Liabilities of failures for three weeks ending
August 20 were $20,932,285. agains: $6,519,366
last year and $8,214,470 in 1894. The stoppage
of Hilton, Hughes <fe Co. this week Is of course not
Included in these figures. The stoppage of works
also continues, inciudiue among other Iron con
cerns the Illinois Steel Plant at Hammond. Ind
and the Lakeside Nail Works there. Disruption
of the tin-plate association results from inability
of many concerns to go on paying wages de
manded, and will presumably be followed by the
stoppage of some, i .tner Ironworks are getting
very litlte new business, and there is so little do
inK that quotations are almost nominal.
Boot and shoe shipments continue large. New
business is scarce. Quick deliveries are urged but
advance in price deters buying beyond actual
need. Leather is a shado weaker and hides again
lose about 2 per cent for the week. Sale* of wool
have been In four weeks only 9, 695 300 pounds
ajralnst 23,v00,400 last year. Actual quotations
are hard to get, but sales to realize are at bargain
prices and domestic exports and shipments of
torelgn in consiaerable quantities. No gain is
seen in the demand for woolen goods.
Cortons show a stronger tone and in a few quali
ties slightly better prices, but the change has been
selling from store without disposition to order
ahead of current wants. Speculation in products
cauicd an advance of 1.62 cm wheat, but by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 1896.

8.62 c and 8c is now quoted with little demand. A
large estimate by Neill is said to be forthcoming.
Latest reports are somewhat more favorable, and
the narrowness of demand with many mills closed
has an influence, >. but stocks of goods in " some
branches are getting low. Domestic business is
slow for the week, 15. 7 per cent less than I last
year. The railroad earnings for the last week re
ported are slightly more favorable than â¢ for tne
second week, and the month's returns thus far 3.1
per cent less than last year, and 14.5 per cent less
than In 1892. . ___L__^il''

OF HIS CRUELTY.
The Man Who Drove a
Woman to Suicide Is
Not Yet Free.
GUILTY LETTERS FOUND
Uncle Sam Steps In and Ed
Marks Is Once More
Under Arrest.
VIOLATED THE POSTAL LAWS.
H s Abusive Letters to Mo'lie Traynor
Were brought to Light by the
Young Woman's Death.
Oakland Office Sa?j Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Aug. 28. )
Ed* Marks, the Bill Syfces of Oakland,
whose letters to Mollie Traynor drove that
young lady to suicide a month ago, snould
have been a free man to-day. But he is
stiil in jail and although no moral law
can reach him for his responsibility in
the death of the girl, by an indirect
method he will probably receive a portion
of his deserts. â 
Marks stands convicted in his own hand
writing of sending vile and obscene litera
ture through the mails. When he wrote
the letters from the County Jail to the
â woman who was generally supposed to be.
his wife. Marks had no idea that they
wouid ever be seen by the public. Neither
would they if Molly Traynor had lived,
for she prized them for the one suggestion
of hope that they contained that Marks
might reform and rejoin her. But when
their conteuts were so heartless, so cruel,
so selrish tnat even the soul of a depraved
woman could not bear up against them,
then she sought the deadly bottle and
Marks might be said to be morally re
sponsible for a murder.
While every body was regretting that the
man who smiled" at the inquest of the
woman he had driven to suicide could not
be reached for the share he took in the
tragedy, the United States Postal Inspec
tors took a hand in the case.
The inspectors wen: through the cor
repondence of the dead girl and found
enough indisputable evidence to convict
as many men as there were letters. All
the depraved man's threats, desires, self
ishness and brutality were carefully read,
and no trouble was experience-i in pre
paring a complaint in the Federal courts.
Ifarca 1 name appears to all the letters,
and there are about fifty of them. They are
all of a nature that Uncle Sam refuses to
carry, and any one wou!d be sufficient to
secure a conviction. Some were written
to the girl from the County Jail, and oth
ers were written to her while she was in
jaiL but all are of the same nature.
"I suppose it will co hard with me,"
said ila r Â£s, as the Federal warrant was
served ou him, "but it can't be helped.
Those letters were never intended for any
body but Mollie, anyhow, but I suppose
it's all the same. It was a surprise to me
when I heard that I was to be rearrested,
bat I don't care much. It would seem
strange to stay in Oakland without Mollie."
The officials will place Marks' record be
fore the Federal Judge, and as there is
practically no defense, it is thought Marks
will not be free for quite a while.

ASKS ANCIENT ALIMONY.
Since It Was Granted Mrs.
Martin Has Outlived a
Second Husband.
Revival of a Chapter of the Early
Life of Old Moses Varney,
Who Died Rich.
Oakland Office Sas Francisco Call,}
903 Broadway, Aug. 28. \
â¢ A suit for divorce, which had its origin
twenty years ago, came up before Judge
Frick this morning. The widow of the
late Moses Varney is suing for $10,200 from
the estate of her late husband, whicn she
claims is delinquent alimony at the rate
of $50 per month granted many years ago.
Many years ago. Varney, who was a
brother of the late Thomas Varney, a mil
lionaire of this county, and who was also
a millionaire, left his family and disap
peared. His wife tried bard to find him
but was unsuccessful and obtained a
divorce. She was also allowed $50 a month
alimony. Varney's attorney now claims
that as no personal service had been made
on Varney, there had been no legal per
sonal judgment. When fonud eventually
Varney had evidently heard of the divorce,
for he had remarried and had two chil
dren.
When found Mrs. Varney tried to col
lect the alimony, but Varney eluded her
and came to reside in Alameda County,
where he acquired property.
Mrs. Varney also remarried and is now
Mrs. Martin. Some time ago Varney's
second wife died. Later, Mrs. Martin's
husband died. Later still, Varney went
to Vermont and died, leaving a snug es
tate.
Now Mrs. Martin- Varney wants $10,200
for alimony. The case will be submitted
on brief and a decision rendered in fifteen
days. â

A Slave From Zanzibar

FOEGOT HIS SUNDAY-SCHOOL.
Juma's Story Was Not Tro?, and H^
Was On'.y Punished for Un
warranted Insolence.
Oaklasd Otttce Sas Feaxcisco Call,}
908 Broadway, A uc. 28. f
The news from Zanzibar had a disas
trous effect on a Zanzibar boy, who is
Jnma of Zanzibar as He Appeared When Dr Jones Befriended Him.
[From a ghap^hot taken by the doctor in Africa.]
|at present In this city. He became so ex
cited when he heard that the British gun
boats had taken a hand in sinking the late
Suitan's yacht that he lost control of him
self and tried to run the house where he
was employed.
Three years ago, when Dr. 0. L. Jones
'. of this city was in Zanzibar, be found a
1 poor little slave who was being kicked
from one street to another, whose clothes
amounted to about as much as a flour sack,
and for whom nobody had any use except
- to abuse. Dr. Jones acted the part of tbe
i Good Samaritan to the boy, and literally
i poured oil on his wounds, and put clothes
; on his back and attached him to his cara
: van.
The doctor took the boy all over Africa,
up tbe Nile and then to Europe, and
finally brought him to his home in Oak
land. Since coming here the lad, whose
name is Juraa, has made great progress.
: He has learned to read and write and is a
! member of a Sunday-school, and also
! marches in the boys' brigade.
Last night Juma forgot himself. He
' read the news from Zanzibar, and as he is
acquainted with every nook and corner of
that country and still feels a great interest
jin its welfare, he became excited. He re
i fused to do his work, refused to be ad
vised or calmed, and finally insulted the
doctor in the presence of several ladies. :
! Dr. Jones says he punished the boy and !
thought no more of it.
This morning Juma appeared at the of
| fice of the Society for the Prevention of \
i Cruelty to Children and told the Secre- !
I tary, Mrs. Lydia Prescott, a harrowing '
tale of slavery and cruelty that he bad :
! suffered at the hands of his master.
Mrs. Prescott made a very thorough in
: vestieation, and was forced to admit that ;
I Juma'3 Sunday-school training bad not
been sufficient to overcome his powerful 1
I Oriental imagination. It developed that
i Juma was well looked after, was well I
' dressed, well fed, and had considerable lib- '
erty. His tale of woe had no foundation
in fact.
"The boy was simply uncontrollable," â .
said the doctor, "when he heard that there
'. was rioting at his old home. W 7 hen one I
Sultan dies there is always an interval j
I before another one is placed in power, j
! During this interval there is no law in the j
\ land, and no one is held responsible for
â  what is done.
"Murder, robbery and all kinds of law- \
j lessness prevail, and order is not restored ]
! till the new Suitan enforces it. When \
j Juma heard how things were he at
; tempted to be as lawless as he could be in j
Zanzibar, and he did not seem to under
stand tnat this is not Africa. He got very
mad because . I cuffed him before some
j ladies, and this morning he went oat and
told a fearful story of his wrongs.
"I hope there will soon be another
I Snltan appointed, because Jnma will not
be of any more use till then."
Probably a Myth.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Aug. 28.â The sensa-"
tional letter injected into the probate case
of the Twombley estate is proved to be. the
work of some one who is interested in cre
ating trouble and profiting by it. The ex
istence of "Miss Hawks' is denied by Mrs.
Josepnine Powell, and Attorney Roths
child, to whom she refers, declares he
never heard of her.

from the railroad track and make a cut
off via Salt Lake, leaving Ogden, bo to
speak, in the shade.
A mass-meeting was called at Ogden
and a committee was directed to wire Mr.
Hearst in New York that the agent ap
pointed to egtabiish and define the course
ot the relays through that region of the
country was prejudiced iv favor of Salt
Late, and in order to carry out his plan to
place Salt Lake on the line had increased
the distance to be traversed. It was set
forth in the dispatch to Mr. Hearst that
the Ogden people bad been earnest and
active supporters of the great wheeling
event long before the residents of Salt
Lake had appreciated the enterprise.
Feeling reached that pitch that there was
talk of sending out armed couriers to
seize tbe packet and bring it through
Ogiien.
While negotiations to adjust the differ
ences were in progress over the wire the
elements intervened and settled the dis
pute in favor of Ogden- A cloudburst
occurred on the desert, which rendered
the cut-off route from Terrace to Salt
Lake impassable. Later on good feeling
was restored by an arrangement to double
up relays and run from Ogden down to
Salt Lake and back again to the Union
Pacific iins.
According to the echedule the riders
should reacn Ogden at 4 o'clock this morn
! ing, but as time was lost on the desert
I Thursday night and only partly retrieved
! yesterday the wheelmen of the relay will
i be four or five houas late on arriving at
i Ogden.
When tbe couriers left Beowawe, Ner.,
Sat 6:35 Thursday evening they were two
I hours and thirty minutes late. At Hal-
I leek, which was reached at 5:25 o'clock
i yesterday (Friday) morning, two hours
i more had been lost. Passing throogti
j Halleck, Toano. Tecoma am Terrace, the
I riders reached Keiton at 9:10 o'clock last
night. The schedule caiiea for arrival
there at sp. M. yesterday. It is not prob
! able that any lost time will be made upon
j tbe run through Promontory, Blue Creek,
Corinne ana Bineham to Ogden, as the
country is mountainous.
Oaden, however, should be reached at 8
| o'clock this evening. The divergence
i from the main line to embrace Salt Late
' in the course may render the arrival at
Evanstoh late. The wheelmen are due at
\ Evanston at 10 A. st to-day.
Among riders who wired arrival on their
respective relays to the Examiner yester
day were: Sibley, Rese, Barnes", Gill,
Hailstrom. Petty, Karris, Magee and Rus
, selL
So far the weather on the course has
been highly favorable. Flurries of snow
may be encountered on the summit of the
Rocky Mountains, but there is no danger
that travel will be impeded by tbe flakes.
After crossing over the Wahsatch Range
of the great continental divide the reiay
riders will have a smooth cour-e on the
Laramie Plains for a long distance before
beginning ascent of the main range of the
Rockies.
Denver is 100 miles south of the adopted
course. There is great anxiety in that city
for the riders to go that way, but the di
version would greatly increase the running
time to the Missouri River.
From Sherman, tbe summit of the main
range of the Rockies, it is down grade all
the way to Omaha, following chiefly the
waterconrse of the >'ortn Platte and
Platte.
At Ogden one hour's time, by reason of
traveling east, will be gained. At Omaha
another hour will be gained.
EQUAL SUFFRAGE NEEDED
Woman Objects to Share Her
Pedestal With Lunatics
and Felons.
Giving the Ballot to the Fairer S:x
Will Remedy Existing Poli
tical Evils.
A large and appreciative audience
greeted Miss Anna Shaw last nieht at
Simpson Memorial Methodist Church,
where the eloquent lady orator delivered
an address on woman suffrage.
"History tells us," said Miss Shaw,
'that republics great ip territorial extent
have not been of long duration. We are
citizens of a republic that is great
and are prone to dwell upon our
wide boundaries, but let as recollect that
the oldest two republics in the world com
prise respectively sixty and twenty-two
square milet. Since the larger of these
was formed, over 1400 years ago, hundreds
of greater republics have risen and fallen.
In the lall of these nations one cause is
distinctly traceable. Lack of money has
never caused the decay of a nation, but
the fall of every government that now
exists only on the pages of history can
be traced directly to corruption of the
moral and spiritual nature of its people.
This is the evil which loyal citizens must
make it their duty to avert.
"Tne republic of to-day is not guaran
teed a.-ainst the dangers which have men
aced and destroyed its predecessors. In a
republic every class that votes affects the
Government along the lines of its nature.
This is a proposition which I desire to em
| phasize, as from it I intend to deduce a
I conclusion from which you cannot escape
i unless you can crawl off like a crawfish
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
Prize-fighters and gamblers, since they
vote, ;ave power to affect the Govern
ment. Good men have the same power,
but the trouble is that sjme good men are
so awfuilv good that they are good for
nothing. This explains the" state of poli
tics in many largecommunities.
"Now, if it be true that men who vote
affect the Government along the iine of
their nature, it follows that women, could
they vote, would affect the Government
along the line of their nature. How wouid
this work ? We hear that women want to
vote in order to be like men. This is non
sense. No women would care to resemofe
most men. hut men have qualities which
distinguish them from women and vice
versa. Men are the stronger in mental
and material force, women the stronger
morally and epiritually. I recollect once
seeing five men and one woman all drutik
as lords and swearing at each other in the
most cheerful fashion. Everybody stared
at the woman, and a gentleman near me
exclaimed :
" 'What a horrible creature! 1
"'Yes, sir.l exclaimed, 'six horrible
creatures.' Nobody seemed to notice the
drunken, profane men, but the woman
was singled out for condemnation. What
a tribute to womanhood ! What an invol
untary confession of woman's moral
superiority! They expected something
better from a woman. As a woman I bow
my acknowledgments.
'â¢Woman, they say, should Â«tay upon
the pedestal where man has placed her.
But man has placed some others
beside woman on the non-voting pedes
tal. There, perched above the politi
cal arena, woman may enjoy
the congenial company of male lunatics,
male criminals, male "traitors, male pau
pers and baby boys. Do you blame her
for wishing to come down to the society of
reputaDle men? No less t; an 260,000 wo
men in England have petitioned Parlia
ment to help them down; in a few short
weeks 25.00U women of California have
signed a similar petition.
"It is objected that women are so relig
ions that their enfranchisement would re
sult in a union of church and state. This
objection ia the weakest I have ever had to
answer. Women are readers, now that
men let them learn to read, and have read
history.
"History tells them the disastrous con
sequences of politico-religious combina
tions in other lands, and they know that
such unions bring about the ruin of the
state and cause decay in the spiritual life
of the church. Women love both church
and country too well to work so grave an
injury to both as to harness them together
in a calamitous union.
"We are told that taxation without rep
resentation is tyranny. We know no
words more true than these. Yet women
are taxed without representation. I have
some experience in paying taxes, and I
take good care that my tax collectors snail
. have an experience with me each time I
pay ti.em, tor I never let them escape
without giving them a redhot woman suf
frage lecture, concluded with a protest
against tbe injustice to which our fore
fathers refused to submit.
"In conclusion, I contend that the best
interests of the Nation would be sub
ser\ed were woman admitted to the right
of suffrage. Deep thinkers have assured
me that it is far more difficult to find
reasons to allege against woman suffrage
than in its favor. I will co a step further,
and challenge a denial of this proposition :
It is impossible to allege one valid argu
ment apainst woman suffrage."
Tbe lecture was enlivened by a number
of sparkling, po-nted annecdotes, admir
ably told, which added greatly to its inter
est and called forth much merriment,
generally at the tyrant man's expense.

SOUND-MONEY DEMOCRATS
The New Executive Committee
Holds a Brief Initial Meeting:.
The new executive committee of the
Sound-money Democratic League of Cali
fornia, appointed day before yesterday by
President E. R. Taylor, held a brief initial
meeting in the assembly-room of the Mills
building yesterday afternoon, but nothing
was done beyond confirming, by vote, on
motion of Attorney William Thomas, tbe
appointment of E. B. Pond as chairman.
Elliott McAllister, secretary of the league,
acted as secretary of the executive com
mittee.
Among the twelve who answered the
rollcallwere E. B. Pond, Elliott McAllis
ter, Christian Reis, William Thomas, Wal
ter P. Johnson and others.
The name of A. A. Watkins was substi
tuted for that of J. W. McDonald on the
committee. It was decided to adjourn
until next Monday afternoon at the same
place, when Chairman Pond will name
the working sub-committees, and when a
selection of permanent headquarters will
probably be made and some definite plans
of work adopted, although active cam
paign operations will not begin until after
the meeting of the National Convention at
Indianapolis next week.
Buckley's Supervisors.
The headquarters of the Buckley Demo
cratic General Committee were rife last
evening with quiet talk about nominees
for Supervisors and School Directors.
- There wars a carefully guarded executive
meeting of the committee appointed ten
days ago to consider names for these
offices and to recommend to the coming
municipal convention a ticket for Super
visors and School Directors. The utmost
secrecy was preserved and no names of
aspiring candidates were given out.
'There was a host of candidates reported,
however. In no ward were there less than
three aspirants, and in the Eleventh and
Twelfth warns there were about a dozen
reported to be seeking a place in the
Board of Supervisors from each ward.
The committee, however, decided on
nothing, and adjourned . to meet next
Monday evening.;

WOMEN'S LIBERAL LEAGUE,
It Does Not Oppose the Saturday
Closing Movement.
Some unscrupulous persons have, with
out warrant of truth, given to the press of
this City the idea that the American
Women's Liberal League opposes, the
attempt of the dry-goods saleswomen to
socur i the closing of the large dry -goods
houses on Saturday evening.
The league would respectfully call the
attention of the public to the fact that it
is organized for one pumose only, namely,
that of defending religions and political
liberty, and cannot, as a body, take cog
nizance officially ot any other public affair.
The executive committee, however,
wishes to emphatically deny that it op
poses any such humane measure as that
advocated by the saleswomen, and would
also say that the ' members * individually
are in thorough sympathy with the move
ment, and are using their best efforts to
circulate petitions and secure signatures
to help the cause.

WHERE HAS ALL
THE MONEY GONE?
Startling Developments Ex
pected in the O'Farrell
Failure.
Assets Estimated at $30,000, or
About One-Third of the
Indebtedness.
MEETING OF THE CREDITORS.
G H Umbsen Appointed Temporary
Receiver â Will at Once Prepare
a Statement
There promise to be some unusual de
veloDments in connection with the failure
of the real-estate firm of O'Farrell & Co.
It will even have something of a romantic
phase.
About fire or six years ago O'Farrell was
presented with the entire business and
good will of the real-estate firm of F. 8.
Wensinger, his uncle, who at that time
retired from the business, having accumu
lated byhis financial acumen and energetic
business met hods a fortune estimated to ex
ceed a million dollars. When O'Farrell
came into the business it was returning,
it is said, a net monthly income of $600.
Shortly after Lang entered the business,
and the tirm name was changed to O'Far
rell _ Lang. Lang, however, did not re
main long with the firm, and from the j
date of his withdrawal, a few years ago, is I
reported to date the retrogression of thÂ«
business, which culminated in the assign
ment ot several days ago.
Some idea of the rapid manner in which
affairs followed a tide of misfortune is
indicated by the fact that the estimated
liabilities of the firm are nearly $100,000,
while the assets are not likely to exceed a
third that amount.
The liabilities are said to consist of
about $45,000 due to people with whom
and for whom the firm did business, and
in the neighborhood of $55,000, moneys
borrowed from Wensinger and other rela
tives.
The assets comprise about $10,000 in bills
receivable and about $20,000 worth of prop
erty, mostly in Oakland.
Just how the great discrepancy In the
firm's assets and liabilities occurred, and
into what channel the great losses thereby I
indicated flowed, is as yet a mystery, and
before the matter is thoroughly investi
gated one or more sensations are likely to
evolve.
It was expected that at the meeting of
the creditors called for yesterday, and !
which was held in the office of the insol-t |
vent firm, prompt measures would be j
adopted to settle affairs, but things were I
found in such a condition that only pre
liminary steps could b e taken.
John T. Doyle, the confidential adviser
of Annie Donahue, representing the larg- '
est creditor, called the meeting of the
creditors to order, and on his suggestion a !
committee of five members was appointed j
to determine upon the best mode of inves- I
tigating the affairs of O'Farrell &Co. and
ascertaining the reason of the failure.
This coininfUee consists of J. D. Sulli
van, J. J. Raver, John T. Doyle, J. Ma
honey and W. B. Zeigler. It was decided I
to hold the next meeting at 11 a. m. Mon
day, in the assembly room of the Mills
building. At this meeting the committee
of five will report the result of their labors
and will also recommend what in their i
opinion is the most advantageous way of j
disposing of the business of the involved
firm.
G. H. Umbsen was chosen receiver pro
tern., and when asked if he would serve
assured the creditors that he would and
wouid give the affairs placed in his charge
the very best of his attention until he was
relieved of the responsibility. In view of
Mr. Umbsen's peculiar knowledge of such
matters it was conceded that no better
choice could have been made for receiver.
He will probably serve until an authentic
and accurate statement can be presented
of the firm's business. Mr. Umbsen has
placed his bookkeepers at work in con
junction with these of O'Farrell in pre
paring such a statement, but does not
expect to have it ready until Monday.

N ACCOUNT OF THE INCREASE IN MY
ON ACCOUNT OF THE INCREASE IN MY
p ano business, my old quarters on Market
st are entirely too small ; I have therefore moved
Into my own building, at 626 Hayes st, between
Octavla and Laguna, t where I can now display
over four times the amount of instruments than
! formerly ; as I buy for cash and in carload lots
I and have no rent to pay I can offer any one desir-
I ing a piano or organ better value for less money
than any other music house in San Francisco.

COL. CROCKER OUT
OF THE FIGHT,
Has Resigned as a Candi
date for Presidential
Elector.
SO HAS W. W. MONTAGUE
The Former Ineligibleâ The Lat
ter Makes a Patriotic
Sacrifice.
BY ADVICE OF MB. SPBECXELS.
Harmony in the Party to Be Regarded
Above All Other Consid*
erations.
W. W. Montague, Republican nomine*
for Presidential elector from the Fourth
Congressional District, sent the following
letter to the Republican State Central
Committee yesterday afternoon as the re
sult of a conference with John D.
Spreckels:
San Feancisco, Aug. 28, 1896.
Major Frank McLaughlin, Chairman Republi
can State Central I ommitteeâ Dear sir: I recog
nize your committee as the only authority
and power in the management of the affairs of
the Republican party in this State. I know
that your committee has been greatly exer
cised over the contention for Presidential
elector in the Fourth Congressional District.
The political issue is too critical to the pros
perity of our Nation and I am too pood a Re
publican and citizen to be a party where such
a condition, if continued to an issue, might
lose an elector for McKiniey in that district,
therefore I tender you my resignation as a
candidate for Presidential elector in the
Fourth Congressional District.
For forty years I have been a Republican,
and you may rest assured that I shall do all I
can for the success of the ReDublican party,
as I have dore in the past.
Hoping that this will meet with the unani
mous approval of your committee, I remain,
yours truly, w. W. Montague.
Mr. Montaeue acted UDon the advice of
John I). Spreckels that it would be better
for him to withdraw in order to secure
harmony in the party and in order that
the prospects of the certain victory for
McKinley and Hobart in California might
not beclouded wi.h two opposing candi
dates for elector upon the ticket.
Colonel Charles F. Crocker also tendered
his resignation as a candidate for elector,
for the reason that his name not having
been placed on the great register he would
not be entitled to vote at the next election
and would therefore not be eligiole as a
candidate. His letter is as follows:
San Francisco, Aug. 28, 1896. I
Hon. Frank McLaughlin, Chairman Repub ican
State Central Committeeâ Be a.r Sib: 1 hereby
tender my resignation as a candidate of the
Republican party for Presidential elector of
this Btate. Being absent from the State during
the tim>; allowed for registration of voters by
the present law, I faiied *o secure my registra
tion, although my return was almost three
months prior to the election, and was very
much surprised to learn that the law nad been
amended so as to close the time for registra
tion on the 9th of August, although in former
years registration had beep allowed up to
within a month of the election. lam advised
that the fact that my name does not appear on
the great register renders me ineligible for the
office for which 1 am nominated, or at least
raises a serious question as to such eligibility.
While I deeply appreciate the honor con
ferred upon me by this nomination the ques
tion of niy eligibility raised above might pos
sibly obstruct or embarrass the success of our
party, and I therefore forego my candidacy. I
feel a deep personal interest in the result of
the ejection, and was proud to be so directly
connected with establishing In this State and
in the Nation the principles for which the
Republican party stands.
I wish to assure you that this action will in
nowise diminish my earnest personal efforts
throughout this campaign to promote the elec
tion of the Republican ticket, and thus secure
the prosperity and welfare of all the people.
Yours very truly, Chableb F. Ceockek.
Colonel Crocker said to a Call reporter
shortly after he had sent his resignation
to the committee that he had been actu
ated solely for the good of the Republican
party. If he remained on the ticket and
the Supreme Court should decide that he
was ineligible one electoral vote would be
lost to Major McKinley. He said that he
has as strong a personal interest in the
election of Major McKinley as any
citizen could have, and for that reason he
did not wish to injure Major McKinley's
chances. He added that he had given bis
reasons fully in the letter of resignation,
and there was nothing that he could add
to them.
The State Central Committee will meet
in a few days and will fill the vacancy.
BRYAN'S CROSS OF COLD
J. A. Stephens Declares the Demo
crats Are the Cruclflers.
The James G. Blame Republican Club is
one of the most enthusiastic of the many
local clubs loyal to patriotism, prosperity
and protection. At the meeting held in
Knights of the Red Branch Hall last
night Thomas Desmond presided and Mi
chael McCormick acted as secretary.
J. A. Stephens was the speaker of the
evening. Mr. Stephens prefaced his remarks
with a glowine tribute to James G. Blame.
After recounting the disastrous eflects of
Democratic policy, he said:
"If Mr. Bryan can convince you that if
he be elected he can change the laws of
nature and make water run uphill then
believe him on this silver question. But
if Daniel Webster and Lincoln and Grant
couldn't do it I don't believe this young
man from the Piatte can do it. It has been
said the gold-miners are willine to sacri
fice themselves in favor of tne silver
miners and of the country. I don't be-
kewjto-pat; _

lieve mine-owners are worse than any
other millionaires. They think just as
much ol their country as any other mil
lionaires, but when they get a million
tbey are always figuring on how to get
another million.
"When Mr. Bryan made bis famous
speech in Chicago he said: 'You shall
not press the crown of thorns upon the
brow of labor; you shall not crucify hu
manity upon a cross of gold.' We ask
him. Who pressed tne thorns upon the brow
of labor? Who crucified humanity upon
the cross of gold? It was the Democratic
party by its policy of free trade. It was
William J. Bryan, who was the most elo
quent advocate of this policy. The Amer
ican people are going to say to Mr. Bryan,
this worshiper of the chimerical goddess
silver; that hero ol the will-o'-the-wisp
financiers of America: 'We are will
ing to bear* your crown of thorns if we
must; we are willing to be crucified upon
a cross of gold if we must, but we will not
allow him to stamp upon tiiis /air country
the damnable word 'repudiation'; we will
not let him stain the nag of this great Re
public in dishonor."
Frank Davey made a brief but eloquent
address in favor of McKinley and the Re
publican platform. A resolution was
adopted recommending Thomas Desmond
for tne nomination of Superintendent of
Streets. Mr. Desmond gracefully ac
knowledged the compliment.

TO-NIGHT'S MEETINGS.
Mr. Estee at the Auditorium and
the National League.
All arrangements nave been perfected
for the big Republican mast-meeting at
the Auditorium, corner of Jones and
Eddy streets, to-nieht. There is wide
spread interest in the speech to be made
by M. M. Estee ou protection and the
financial Question. Mr. Estee has de
voted many years of study to the subjects
of protection and finance. His address, or
rather talk, will not be garlanded with
the flowers of rhetoric and framed with
those Delsarte gestures in which boy
orators are wont to indulge, but will be a
plain, logical statement of the issues now
before the people.
The gallery will be reserved for ladies
and their escorts.
The opening of the new headquarters of
the National Republican League will take
place to-night in Pioneer Hall with a
maas-raeeting, at which the following
named will speak: Irving M. Scott. Rev.
Anna Shaw, Hon. Frank L. Coombs, Gen
eral Robert A. Friedrich, Z. U. Dodge
Judge Henry C. Dibble, William F. Gib
son, Judge M. J. Waldheimer, Louis
Titus, James A. Stephens and A. R.
Kanaga.
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.
Veterans True Blue for McKinley
and Protection.
The McKinley Veteran Boldiers and
Sailors Republican Club was gratified
last evening when Secretary E. P. Morey
read two autograph letters, one from
Major McKinley dated Canton, Ohio, and
one from Garret A. Hobart, dated at Pat
erson, N. J., thanking the club for the
preamble and resolutions sent to the dis
tinguished gentlemen and the assurance
of their support.
The club passed a resolution to attend
in a body the Republican mass-meeting at
the Auditorium this evening when M. M.
Estee will speak.
Stirring addresses were made by Andrew
Branch, Charles E. Wilson, W. B. Mayd
well and Chairman Fergus Hansen, after

GOLD MINING AND
THE SILVER WAVE
Bryan's Election Would
Cause Capital to
Withdraw.
PROSPECTING NO MORE.
Colonel Malcolm D. Calkins Fur
nishes Some Interesting
Facts.
MINERS SEEING THE TRUTH.
_ ââ
They Do Not Want to Be Paid in
Fifty-Cent Dollars and Will Vote
for McKinley.
Colonel Malcolm D. Calkins of
the Amador Record, is in the City. He
nas talked with many miners from all
COLONEL MALCOLM D. CALKINS.
parts of California during the pa3t few
months; in fact, since the National polit
ical conventions. What Colonel Calkins
had yesterday to say to a reporter for The
Call was of more than common interest.
Colonel Calkins has been in California
many years, having first come here in
1850. and during the long period elapsing
since that date he has been familiar with
the mining interests of the State.
"California is a gold State naturally,"
said Colonel Calkins, "and the miners are
aware of this. The preponderance in gold
production In California aboye the silver
production is an annual object lesson upon
this point. Last year California produced
upward of $15,000,000 in gold, according to
the official figures, while the production
of silver in this State was relatively very
small. This is, however, only one view of
the case.
"A large amount of capital is concerned
in prospecting tor gold and in opening up
for exploitation new gold mines in this
State at this time. Take, for instance, Ama
dor County, which is illustrative, as the
same general conditions exist in the other
great gold-producing counties of Califor
nia. In our one county of Amador gold
mining enterprises are under considera
tion, K'hich in twelve or in eighteen
months at the outside will involve an ex
penditure of $500,000 at least. This de
penas, however, upon Republican suc
cess, for if the silver craze has its way
these enterprises will be discouraged.
"The Oneida mine will put $200,000 into
preliminary work alone. I have no pa
tience with the people who are fomenting
this silver craze. But," said the colonel,
"Bryan stands a much poorer chance of
carrying California than he had jusi after
he was nominated. At that time there
were a great many miners who thougbi
that the free coinage of silver would be a
great benefit to them by increasing their
wages. They figured it out in this way:
That the demand for labor in the silver
mines in other States would take out all
the idle miners from California and so
make a demand for those that remained.
Now, when it occurs to them that they
may have to accept 50-cent silver dollars
in payment for their wcrk their ideas have
changed somewhat, and they are coming
over to vote for protection and an honest
dollar.
"We clearly see in the interior of Cali
fornia that protection is the real issue of
this campaign. The free coinage of silver
would not help us. How can it help any
one to be paid in 50-cent dollars? The
Populists in Amador County are very sore
at the way they have been goDblod vp â
bagged, so to speak. There is no doubt
at all that the silver craze, if Bryan should
be elected, would proved isastrous to pros
pectin? for mines throughout the State.
There is not any Republican paper in the
interior which is not standing up for Mc-
Kiniey and honest money, with the excep
tion of the Sacramento Bee. The real
secret of the silver agitation is the great
combination of capitalists owning Ameri
can silver mines and hoping also to own
all the Mexican silver mines which are
not already in their possession or under
their control. This immensely rich silver
mine syndicate is not making a poor
man's campaign. On the contrary, it is
a rich man's campaignâ a campaien in
the interest of one of the greatest com
bines of capital that has ever existed in
the United States."
THEY SLEEP IN BUNKS.
Why Eleven Men Registered From
One Room of the Crystal
Lodging-House.
The Election Commissioners thought
they had struck a lead in their search for
stuffers yesterday when, in their investiga
tions, they came to the Crystal House, a
10-cent lodginn-house in the basement of
the Koster House at 675 Howard street.
It appeared that eleven men were reg
istered from one room and the Commis
sioners wanted to know how this came
about. The proprietor and his clerk were
both present and swore that the men
roomed in tho house.
They explained that a genuine bed was
not given for 10 cents, but that the one
large room comprising the "house" con
tained a large number of bunKs, and that
each of the eleven alleged stuffers Joccu
pied one of these.
Though the explanation seemed plans-
ible, the Commissioners desired to in"
yestigate further and continued the hear
ing for one week.

ON PRESIDIO HEIGHTS.
The Sterling Republican Club of That
Locality Has a " Ladies' Night."
Tne Presidio Heights Republican Ciub
held a meeting in its new wigwam on
Maple street, between Clay and Washing
ton, last evening. It was a ladies' night
as a large number of the fair future voters
were present.
The meeting was presided over by Dr.
Regensburger.
William H. Schooler and School Di
rector Thomas Knox addressed the audi
ence in pithy and entertainig speeches,
scoring the Nebraska man and his Demo
cratic-Populisi-silver following unmerci
fully.
Mr. Knox said the silver dollar is worth
53 cents, and who is goinir to back and be
responsible for the other 47 cents.
"We are a borrvwing nation," said he,
"and borrow largely from England, who
exacts the gold dollar in return. Who is
to pay that extra 47 cents when we get to
silver exclusively? And how can we
borrow money if we give out in advance
that we intend to repudiate' the difference
between a gold and a silver dollar? This
is a silver miners' campaign against the
sound-money Republican party â a cam
paign of the people who have bullion to
sell, and the Government will be asked to
put a high market price on the output of
the Colorado mines."
Miss Shaw stepped on the platform
amid prolonged apolause and went
directly inlo the subject of her speech, as
follows:
I can't say I am a Republican or anything as
yet. lam not goo<l enough to be v Repub
lican, not free enough to be a Democrat, have
not suffered enough to be a Populist and am
I not sober enough to be a ProhibUianist. But if
! the Republican party be true to its promises,
I to its glorious past, we will be good enough
for its ranks. The Republican party put that
suffrage plank into its plaiform because it
thought the time was ripe for the emancipa
tion of the ballotless pan of the people, and
that women, who bear part of the burdens of
taxation, should take part in the government.

LADIES APPLAUD
McKINLEY'S NAME

to the Republican
Nominee.
ALL FOR PROTECTION.
Ladies' Night of the Continental
League a Brilliant
Success.
SLENDEE HANDS GIVE PRAISE.
Senator Perkins and Congressman
Loud Deliver Timely and Pa
triotic Addresses.
Youth and old age, wit, wisdom and
beauty, were common companions at the
"Ladies' Night" meeting, held under the
auspices of the Continental League at Sar
atoga Hall last night.
It was a rarely intelligent audience, the
gentler sex largely predominating. They
were extremely liberal in their applause of
the patriotic utterances, evidencing the
fact that the women of the land are taking
a keen and lively interest in affairs polit
icaL
The evening's entertainment opened
wiih an overture by an orchestra, followed
by a few remarks from Frank D. Worth,
president of the league. He said the
gathering was intended particularly for
the entertainment and benefit of the
ladies, but he expected they would take
such a lively interest in the league +hat
they would find it convenient to work for
McKinley and Hobart, the Republican
nominees for President and Vice-Presi
dent respectively.
The league was organized less than six
months ago, he said, with a membership
of only seventy-five. At this time the
membership was considerably over 1300,
and he hoped that within a few months it
would swell well into the thousands.
Senator George C. Perkins was the first
speaker of the evening. After paying a
neat compliment to the ladies, ti.e Sena
tor among other thing 3 said :
"We come before ti.e people and ask
what are the issues of the day? We
know that most of you ladies are Repub
licans because it is the party of progress,
of enterprise and prosperity. Has the
present administration done anything for
the good of the country? The record
shows that it has not. Four years aeo
this land was happy and prosperous.
Every man or woman wl>o wanted to make
a living was enabled to do so. There have
been no disasters, no scourges, yet no
sooner were the ballots counted three
years ago than the trouble began. There
was a general distrnst.
"The manufacturer said he would run on
short time, and that feeling prevailed in
all business. When Harrison delivered
his final address in 1893 he congratulated
the people on the prosperity of the coun
try. No sooner was Cleveland inaug
urated than an unheard-of thing occurred.
An army of tramps, which increased with
each day. began a march toward Wash
ington. It was a sad spectacle, but there
was no remedy."
Senator Perkins then in a general way
called attention to the first act of Cleve
land in calling a special session of Con
gress to repeal the purchasing silver
clause. The disaster that this act had
brought about needed no comment. He
referred incidentally to the fact that a
duty should be placed on all foreign goods
which compete with home productions.
Congressman Loud and Hon. H. C. Dib
ble followed in brief addresses in which
tliey predicted the utter rout of the Dem
ocratic party in November and the conse
quent return of an era of prosperity.
The officers and vice-presidents of the
Continental League are as follows:
Frank G. Worth, president; Will E. Fisher,
first vice-president; William T. Kibbler, second
vice-president; Maurice L. Asher, secretary;

What the Jeople Think i. hey See In
Silver.
This is the heading of an able argument
in this week's News Letter, wherein the
writer shows up the free-silver fallacy
clearly and indisputably. Tne general
argument that times are so bad that they
cannot possibly become worse, and that
therefore any change will surely be for the
better, is disproved in a logical manner.
People who imagine that iree coinage of
silver would make its general circulation
any tho easier cannot do better than
study this article. It will change their
views.

Uniformed Health Inspector*.
Uniformed employes will be the next inno
vation of the Board of Health, and within a
short time the inspectors and messengers will
be wearing blue suits with brass buttons and
a suitable badge of office. The idea is that
of Dr. Fitz-gibbous, who saw such uniformed
inspectors in other large cities and was struck
with the feasibility of it. The style of the
suits has not been decided on, but will be
taken up at an early meeting.
