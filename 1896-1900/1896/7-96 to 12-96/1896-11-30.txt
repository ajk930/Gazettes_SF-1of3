Aerial Lights Seen Flitting
in San Fernando
Valley.
SIMILAR PHENOMENON
SEEN IN ALAMEDA.
Brief Review of the Remarkable
Developments of the Past
Week.
J'SAGE REFLECTIONS MADE BY
MAYOR DAVIE.
S es No Cause for Surprise in the
Cam That A?rial Navigatioa
Is Possible.
It i* now about ten days since the hrst
report regarding the elusive and mysteri
ous aerial lights came from Sacramento.
>;m:e then developments in reference to
them have been rapid and sensational, but
mystery still surrounds the object and the
human agency that are said to be respon
sible for ther appearance.
At this time tne history of the myth,
phenomenon, airship or whatever it may
prove to be, will beÂ«r a brief review.
Tnis is given that the readers of The Call
may the more readily and intelligently
graÂ«p the present situation.
Incredulity, deep and general, greeted
the first report which credited the lights
to an aerial voyacer. Next it was an
nounced that George D. Collins, an at
torney of this City, was the legal repre
sentative ot the inventor ana manipulator
of the wonder of the starlit sky. This
honor Mr. Collins did not disavow, but
wjis unconquerably obdurate when it came
to a question of disclosing the name of hia
c client, the location where the marvel was
put together, or the place where it found
exemption from the eyes of the curious.
The knowledge that this interestingin
formation was lodged in irs legal custody
= caused him to be besieged by newspaper
reporters, speculators, invc-stoi*. cranks
aEKi a horde of curiosity-seekers. Under
'th-e. pressure thus put upon his time and
patience, be made numerous statements
relative to the matter that was absorbine
; public attention and his connection there
â¢ with.
Unfortunately these statement?, as pub
lished in the various newspapers, did not
Â°lit?together quite as accurately as a scien
tifically constructed edifice should. Among
otner things he allowed it to be inferred
that a Dr. Fi. H. Benjamin had aided in
the construction of the invention.
â¢ Meanwhile reports continued to come
to hand daily of strange and luminous
visions. Men well and most favorably
known in scientific, official, professional,
business and educational circles claimed
to l*ave seen these nocturnal visitations of
moving lights at great altitudes. None,
however, appear to have secured a clear
vie.w of the body to which it was sup
posed these aerial lights were attached,
though most observers of the phenom
enon stood ready to assert that they were
guided in theircourse athwart the horizon
by human power. Sacramento, Oakland
and San Jose furnished the most frequent
and startling descriptions of the mystery,
I Suddenly came the news that ex-Attor
ney-General W. H. 11. Hart had been sub
stituted for M.r. Collins as the legal cus
todian of the secrets and destinies of the
reputed airship.
This was followed by the announcement,
on the authority of General Hart, that the
airship mystery was only incidental to a
full-fledged and extraordinary filibuster
ing scheme for the capture or destruction
of Havana, the stronghold of the Spanish
authorities in Cuba, by the use of dyna
mite. He further informed the startled
public that the aerial warship to be used
in this enterprise wouiu be designed to
carry half a tun of dynamite, in addition
to its necessary appurtenances and crew.
He also, over his own signature, averred
that two airships were now in readiness
to sail the ethereal blue, and that another,
on modified and improved plans, was in
course of construction. As soon as this
last-mentioned crafl was completed and
the crew made thoroughly acquainted
with its handling it was to take flight, he
said, to Havana, there to aid the Cubans
in their struggle for independence.
For his advÂ»cacy 6f the use of dynamite
General Hart was taken to task by the
Bulletin, which was tentatively abetted by
tbÂ°e Examiner. This attack elicited a
spfrited and martial-toned rejoinder. The
ftar in the public mind now is that the
scene of war *^ay be transferred from the
carnage-stained fields Oi Cuba to the un
offend nÂ« co:unins of the local newspa
per*.
Shortly after the name of Dr. E. H.
Benjamin appeared in connection with
the mystery of the air he disappeared
from his lodgings at 633 Ellis street, where
liy had l:ved lor two years, leaving noth
ing more than a carefuiiy locked trunk
Vfehind. Yesterday morning he called, for
his bag aire and then "flew the coop," as
the detectives phrase it, leaving no trace
aa to nis future movements, but on the con
trary taking precautions to cover his
tracks.

lights, and an electrician states it bore all
the characteristics of an eiectric light.
Anderson, a town about ten miles soath
of Redding, lays claim to the honor of a
visit from the aerial nondescript on Satur
day niglit.
Mayor Davis contributes some pertinent
philosophical reflections to the literature
of the topic of the day.
Dispatches from Los Angeles last night
state that the sirange lights have been
seen in the neighborhood for the past few
days.
General Hart had something further to
say yesterday on the use of dynamite in
war.
"In the event that an airship could be
made to destroy a city," he said, "that in
itself would firmly establish the peace of
the civilized world. It would be realized
that it would be no use to light against
such means. The very fact thai such a
thing could be done would bring about uni
versal peace. The result would b3 that
the nations would resort to arbitration in
all matters of international differences. It
would no longer be a matter who has tne
biggest cannon and who can shoot the
farthest. There would be no use lor
navies or fortilications, and thus would be
brought about absolute peace."
He also took occasion to explain that
the 120- mile flight referred to in yester
day's Call was made with the larger air
ship. The smaller one, he added, is capa
ble of moving much more rapidly, By
going with the atmospheric currents and
using the electric power at the same time,
he claimed, it can attain a speed of forty to
lifty miles an hour.
One point that has been noticed is that
Attorney Hart intimated several days ago
tUat the course of tue airship would be
southerly and dispatches confirmatory of
this were last night received from Los An
gles.
OVER ALAMEDA.
The Mysterious Lights Made Their
Appearance on Saturday
Night Last.
Alameda had another spell of excite
ment over the airship on Saturaay night,
when the mysterious light that has been
puzzling residents of the towns about the
bay made its appearance over the south
ern portion of the Enciual city.'
Shonly after dark the family of a gen
tleman living at Versailles station, while
observing the heavens from the southern
windows of the house saw a big white
light suddenly appear high in the air
about over Bay Farm Island. It seemed
to flare out in a second as though some
thing that had obscured it had suddenly
been removed. All watched with breath
less interest while it rose, passing rapidly
westward meanwhile to a greater height,
where it seemed to pause for an instant.
It then turned toward the south and
pas?ed on in that direction.
It appeared about the size of a man's
head when first seen, but grew smaller
and smaller until it passed out of eiyht.
The time that elapsed between the first
appearance and the disappearance was
aboui twenty minutes, and all agreed that
it seemed to urch from sidp to side aa it
went southward.
A gentleman visiting at the house, who
hns had considerable to do with electric
light power, and who saw the aerial
mystery, is convinced that it could heve
been nothing else than an electric light of
great power.
ANDERSON IN LINE.
Her Citizens Claim to Have. Saen
the Aerial Mystery In Its
Flight.
REDDING, Cal., Nov. 29.â Anderson,
located about ten miles south of Redding,
is either in line with other cities of the
coast or else her citizens have the same
"night owl" proclivities, for it is current
talk that the aerial monster passed over
Anderson last evening about 20 minutes
past 8. Her citizens claim to have seen
the stranger in its flight.
It was first observed from the corner of
East Center and Ferry streets by a re
putable citizen noticing a peculiar light in
the westward. He called the attention of
others to the seeming phenomenon, and
quite a crowd collected. It was generally
conceded that this must he the long
ta!Ked-of airship. Its course was south
and west, and the lights ioon disappeared
in the south. The light was large and
brilliant and seemed to move in a steady
course.
AN ORAL REVERIE.
Mayor Davie Says Some Pointed
Things About a Current
Topic of Interest
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 29. â Mayor
Davie has seen a phase of human incon
sistency during the past week that has
amused him. It is best told in his own
words:
"Whether there be an airship cruising
nightly over this neighborhood," said his
Honor to a little group of friends yester
day, "is only a secondary matter with me
at this time. If there be not one now, I
am convinced that the problem of aerial
navigation will soon be solved. What is
now interesting me is the peculiarities of
some newspapers and some newspaper
readers.
'â¢Early Sunday, as you all know, we find
on our doorsteps small libraries which are
called daily newspapers. We look through
them and find that a good portion of them
Js occupied wit h the marvelous things that
scientists perfect and prophesy. During
the past few months this has been more
the case than ever before. The newspapers
publish all these things as facts, prof ess to
believe them, and the majority of their
renders accept them as truth. Being some
what of a scientist myself, I am led to be
lieve in many thing? that now appear im
probable. But I have a precedent for it.
"A year ago if any one had told me that
they could produce a ray of li-jht that
would photograph my watch through a
wooden box wouid I have boen called an
ass for doubtin.' him? Yet I have seen
this very thing done. Wo have all read
of the progress of aeronautics, and yet
when a thousand reputable citizens de
clare that they have seen some kind of a
machine navigatirg the ssies, and believe
their eyesight as proof that some one has
done what the newspapers have told us
for years is only a matter of time, most of
those papers try to make us believe that
they have been fooling us with their prob
abilities, and that their stories of scientific
prophecies are all fool stories.

ventor named Dr. Secring who lived in
this city. One day I hear! a conversation
between him and the late Walter Blair,
who built the Piedmont cable road. Seer
ing told Blair not to think of putting his
fortune into an expensive trench in the
ground as in a short time electric-cars
would be running all over Oakland. Blair
laughed at the idea, put his trench in the
ground and put his foitune into it, and
electricity was substituted on his system
after the road dad been sold by the Sheriff.
Dr. Seering fell dead on the street here
about two years aeo, but a few weeks be-,
fore his death he told me that with nlumi-Â«
num and electricity an airship would soon
be a certainty. I don't say this as proof
that there is a successful airship now in
use, but I will say that if I were to read in
to-morrow's paper absolute proof that onÂ«
has been constructed, I should not be any
more eurprised than Walter Blair was
alter he saw bis mistake."
SOUTH OF TEHACHAPI.
The Aerial Wonder Appears to the
People of San Fernando
Valley.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 29.â The
operator of the California airship seems to
find the climatic conditions soutn of
Tehachapi very favorable for the evolu
tions of his bird-like machine.
Persons whose occupations keep them
up late into the night relate experiences
of having seen strange and peculiar lights
during the past three nights moving about
near the summit of the mountains or
crossing the valleys at a rapid rate.
These visitations have heretofore been
witnessed by only a few persons, but to
night scores of residents of East Los An
geles saw the flitting light in the direction
of Pasadena moving along the foothills
toward Santa Monica.
A Call correspondent took great pains
this evening to verify thÂ« reports about
the lights, and is now thoroughly satisfied
that some very unusual spectacle was seen
by a large number of persons, all of whom
gave substantially the same description of
what they saw, and there can no longer be
any question but that some figure of huge
outline and carrying a light has been seen,
in the San Fernando Valley and along the
foothills extending from the valley to
Santa Monica.
Motorman Millsap of the Downey
avenue car line, which runs into East Los
Angeles, gave the best description among
the many interviewed. He is quite sura
that what ne saw is an aerial machine
operated by a human being. -

Senator Mantle of Montana Earnestly Favors the Recognition of a Great
Industry. ' .
TO THE EDITOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL--Sir: Replying
to your favor inquiring as to my opinion regarding the cre
ation of a â  'Bureau of Mining" by Congress and a â¢ 'Secretary of
Mines and Mining" to be a member of the Cabinet, permit me to
say that the subject is one which has my active sympathy. I
quite agree with you that the mining industry of the Nation
has now assumed such immense proportions, and has become such
an important factor in the growth and advancement of the coun
try, that it is entitled to this recognition.
I shall take especial pleasure in giving my earnest support
to the movement and in co-operating with those chiefly concerned,
and especially with Western members and Senators, in the effort
to secure this just and necessary legislation.

PICTURES IMPRESSED UPON THE BRAIN.
BOSTON. Mas? , Nov. 29. â An experiment, the result of which delighted and surprised the scientists present, was
made with X-rays to-day at the Crystal Maze, which tended to prove that Roentgen's light impresses pictures on the brain
independent of the eyes. The subject was Dr. James Richard Cooke, a regularly graduated physician, now practicing in
the Back Bay.
The experiment was conducted by Professor Sutherland of Boston University and Mr. yon Palm. Cooke became
blind when three days old. He was placed in the cabinet with -Dr. Sutherland and fluoroscopic screens placed in front of
his sightless eves. When the current was turned on he distinguished the ray's and experienced a painful sensation. Then
the top of his forehead was placed against the screen and a block of wood thrust before the glass. Immediately he stated
that something resembling a slab, but seemingly of no density, appeared on his brain. â 
Finally a screw-driver was placed before the screen ana Dr. Cooke placed his finger on the glass and cried out that an
elongated object had appeared on his brain. When the screw-driver was placed in front of his eyes and the current
turned an, Dr. Cooke could not distinguish it, but when it was placed in front of the forehead he immediately distin
guished it.

The house was discovered in flames by
Mr. Thompson at 6:45 a. m. He rushed
for the building and burst open the front
door but was driven back by the' fin roes,
which seemed to be in possession of the
whole interior. He then knocked opeji a
room window and took hold of Mr. Green
man, who was burned so that the flesh
came off in Thompson's hand, and it was
all he could do to drag out the corpse.
He was then compelled to flee from the
house, the flames which came from the
window almost burning him. The house
was quickly destroyed.
, Comner Matson arrived and the horri
bly charred remains of the family were
.taken from the' smoldering ruins. An
inquest will be held in the morning. The
fire was undoubtedly the result of a defec
tive stovepipe. Greenman and his family
were burned out two years ago, barely
escaping with their lives.
INTENSELY COLD WEATHER.
Gnat Suffering in the Far North and

ST. PAUL. Mix*.. Nov. 29.â The in

storm-swept districts of the Northwest
has brought on intense tunVrine, and the
death list of four is expected 'to be in
creased unless milder weather sets in.

The weather, however, is very severe, tne
temperature being below zero all over
Minnesota and the Daketas.
The thermometer registered 12 below

NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 29.â The first
real snowstorm of the season in this city
made itself felt to-day. The promised
cold wave was also on hand, although the
temperature was not low enough to have
been disagreeable if the. weather had been
clear.
At about 3 o'clock this afternoon bail
began to fall and continued for about half
an hour. Then cams a light, misty rain,
which continued intermittently until
about 7 o'clock, when it changed to snow.
At first the flakes were light and hardly
distinguishable from a heavy mist. But
soon they grew larger, and at 8 o'clock
quite a respectable snowstorm was pre
vailing. At 11 o'clock the ground was
white. By midnight the aspect was de
cidedly wintry, and at 3 o'clock in the
morning a heavy snowfall continued.
EDISON GIVES HER SIGHT.
Objects Seen and Distinguished by the
Aid of X-Ra/s by a Child Blinded
Several Years Ago.
NEW YORK, N. V., No*-. 29.â With the
.aid of X-rays, Thomas Edison has enabled
nine-year-old Kittie Schoellner of Newarlc,
N. J., to see after having been blind for
two and a half years^s the result of a fall,
which crushed one of the bones of the
skull, and it is thought, caused a pressure
on the opttc nerve, paralyzing it.
The child was taken by her father to the
laboratory 1/.. Tuesday, and Mr. Edison
consented to see if the X-raya would en
able her to see. Ho says:
"When the little girl arrived I asked her
if she could see anything. She said 'No.'
I placed her in front of the lamp and she
â¢told me she saw light
"I then, ran my hand in- between the
light and! her eyes. She Â«aid: 'There is
something in front,' and then said it was
a hsnd. One of the boys at the laboratory,
Ned Daily, then placed a piece of brass,
cut. circular, in front of ner. and she said
it was a plate. A little while later she
said it was a yellow plate.
"I asked her father if he was positive
she was blind. He said he was. I then
took the lamp and moved it from side to
side, and her eyes followed it and she told
me just where I stood.
"The next night we tried to discover
the location of the bone pressing down on
her optic nerve. The doctor said he was
not able to see it, although we expect we
will be able to take a pboiograph showing
the bone. The remarkable thing to me
washer ability to distinguish colors. " I
believe this is a new feature.
"This experiment was not made with
the fluoroscope. It was made with the
cild looking directly at the lamp. The
reports that the fluorescopo will aid the
blind to distinguish articles is all wrong.
No X-ray gets through the fluoroscope. In
a rluorofcone is simply light."
Mr. Edison said he did not think the
X-rny would enaole the blind to read, be
cuuse the article to be seen must be of
metal.
BAD BLOOD AT A BALL GAME.
Indians cf the Choctaw Nation Show Their
Bitter Rivalry by Using Bats With
Deadly Effect
PARIS, Tex.. Nov. 29.â For some time
the Indians of Red River and Eagle coun
ties, Chcctaw nation, have been playing
match games of ball and the rivalry be
came so intense that bad blooa was en
gendered.
Last Thursday at Good water the antag
onism between the two counties culmin
ated in a cenenii fight, in which the butt
ends ot their ball sticks were ireely used
and men wire knocked down all over the
ball field, some twenty or thirty being
more or less iniured. Will Goings had
his ?kull crushed and died in a short time.
P^astnian Battise received injuries from
which he died. John Billy waa seriously
wounded.
Sheriff Huston 01 Eagle County was so
badly injured, it is said, he cannot pos
sibly recover. No arrests will follow, as
the Indians have no law to punish a man
for killing another in a ball game. No
firearms or knives were used.

HUNDREDS OF OLD MEK, WOMEN

Terrible Massacre of Those Who
Surrendered in the Province

KEY WEST, Fla., Nov. 29.â Late Ha
vana advices say the extermination of
pacilicos continues by Weyler'a special
orders. All commanders are ordered to
clear the country of all non-combatanta.
This is done silently.
Communication with the country is
difficult and it is hard to obtain details.
The massacres only become known through
the confessions of officers and soldiers in
some cases. Colonel Struch, it is said,
openly boasted in Havana of killing over
"jOO old men, women and girls, who sur
rendered in Pinar del Rio Province.
Many have btea also killed in other
provinces. It is also reported that Colonel
Struch, while in his cuds, gave r volting
detaiU of the Pinar del Rio massacre.
On the night of November 2J Colone
Struch and his men drank heavily and
then followed one of the most horrible oc
currences of the war. Inflamed by drink,
the Spanish soldiers ru-hed upon their
helpless prisoners and subjected them to
.treatment which cannot be described in
print Finally Colonel Struch significantly
told his men that "it wai no use to bo
longer bothered by the Cuban cattle."
The soldiers took thÂ» hint and immedi
ately began firing on the old women and
girls. Volley after volley of lead was Sred
at the cowering and shriekiug creatures
who had so lately been the victims of
Spanish cruelty until not one was left
alive. The- bodies of the victims were left
to ths vultures, and; Colonel Struch
marched his command bacli to headquar
ters and reported to Cap.tain-General Wey
ler that several insnrgent Â«camps had been
"raided and about 300 rebels killed."
Colonel Slruch and many of his officers
were eiven furloughs iii consideration of
their services and returned to Havana.
Since going to Havana Colonel Struch
has been drunk all the time and has
openly boasted of the awful slaughter of
innocents. This story is not in the least
exaggerated, as it is made upon official
statements which have fallen from the
lips of Colonel Struch as he staggered out
of the cafes of Havana.
From other provinces come stories of
massacre of innocents, but none so well
authenticated as the one related above.
Weyler's edict offering pardon to those
who surrender is proving to be simply a
dev'fee to lure Cuban's to death.

TRAMPLED TO DEATH BY A CROWD
Great Crowds of People Who Turned Out
to Welcome the Viceroy of India
Become Stampeded.
BOMBAY, India, Nov. 29.â A dispatch
from Kasoda, capital of the State of that
name, gives the details of v fatal accident
which occurred there to-niglit. The Earl
of Eigin. Viceroy of India, arrived at
Baroiea this evening on a visit to the
Gaikwar, or native ruler of the state. The
inhabitants turned out en masse to wel
come the Viceroy and to see a display of
fireworks in his honor. The dispiay was
given in the park of the Gaikwar, which
was open to the public.
Everything t assed off without incident
or note until the end of the ceremonies.
Then the crowd made a rush for the park
gates, which were so narrow that they
L - soon became jammed with people. Those
behind, not knowing the cause oi the de
lay at the exit, pressed forward until the
crush at the gates was terrific. A num
ber of persons were squeezed to death,
while others who lost their footing in the
surging mass of humanity had the life
trampled out of them or died from suffo
cation. When the crowd was finally
cleared nway it was found that twenty
nine persons had been killed and thirty
five others more or less seriously injured.
UNCLE SAM SHOULD ACT PROMPTLY
Foster Says That Unless This Country
Annexes Hawaii Some Other Power
Will Step In.
CHICAGO. 111., Nov. 29.â John "W.
Foster, ex-Secretary of State, and Mrs.
Foster arrived in Chicago yesterday on
taeir way to their home in Washington
from Honolulu. They spent a little more
than two weeks on the islands, and Mr.
Foster's observations continued the belief
which he promulgated as premier of
President Harrison's Cabinet that annexa
tion by the United States is the duty of

"The present Hawaiian administration
is waiting for the inauguration of Presi

have the islands annexed." sai i Mr. Fos
ter. "Tne constitution under which the
people of the islands are livine: at present
has annexation as one of the main things
to be striven for. The islands were never
in a more prosperous condition than at
present. They are prospering in a busi

.an exceptionally good one, and the ad
ministration of President Dole is the best

"It is recognized that the ultimate fate
of the islands, if they are not annexed by
the United States, is that they will be
annexed by some other of the great
powers. It will be impossible for the

UNION OF RAILWAY TRAINMEN.
A Movement on Foot to Have the Members
of All Branches Join in a
.o Common Cause.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 29.â A mass
meeting of railway trainmen was held
here this evening at Druids' Hall. The
meeting was called by five local lodges of
thd Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.
W. C. Pierce, secretary of the Trackmen's
Union, presided aud explained that the
purpose of the meeting was to discuss the
feasibility of uniting all organized bodies
of : rai!road workmen.
Second Vice-Grand Master T. R. Dodge
of Chicago was the first speaker. He ad
vocated a general unionâ not for strikes
and boycotts, but to secure compulsory
arbitration and the enactment of Jaw
lending to better the workers.
T. E. Merriweather, State Labor Com
missioner Â»f Missouri, m:de a stirrintr
ten-minute speech that aroused the 500
auditors. Oihers made short speecnes and
6 recess was taken.
Upon reassembling at 7:45 p. m. Chair
man Pierce dispensed with ceremony and
calied for short experience talks.
A committee of one from each of the
five branches of the Trainmen's Brother
ho' d was appointed to meet any author
ized body of railway workmen to work
upon a plan of union.
Like meetines were held to-day in JÂ»ud
bury. Pa., and Columbus, Ohio. The plan
most favored for union is for each orancn
of railroad service to maintain its separate
organization, but to send delegates to a
fceneral congress of all railroad labor
unions. This congress should only
assume to deal wit > questions that inter
ested all the workers, such as the secur
in-r o; arbitration Jaws and laws punishing
black-listing, e:c, and should have no
power to order strikes or boycotts.

f Copyright/1896, by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 29.â Tbe very
latest advices received here from St. Pe
turg through official channels confirm
the reports contained in yesterday's dis
patches of the United Associated Presses
oi coming changes in the administration
of affairs of the Russian empirÂ», and at
test the correctness of the appointments
mentioned as about to be made. The ad
vices, however, discredit the reports of an
Anglo-llussian i-nientc. The view of the
situation in Russia most generally taken
in official quarters here is that the Czur
has not yet acquired confidence in himself
or in any particular Minister sufficient to
warrant him in venturing upon a change
in the loreign policy established by the
late Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince
Lobanoff, and that for some time to come
the foreign policy in force in Russia mnst
necessarily be tentative.
In tiie meantime the inliuence of M.
Nelidoff, tie Russian Embussador to Tur
key and aspirant to the Foreign Ministry,
is dominant, which is regarded here as
implying a continuation of Russia's pro
tection of the Sultan, her absolute rejec
tion of ail schemes for European interfer
ence in Turkey, financial or otherwise,
and the action of Russia in the capacity
ot tutor to the Sultan to the end of his
reliance upon Russia until the Sultan ot
the Ottoman Empire shall become practi
cally a vassal of the ( zar. This view is
taken as an explanation of the fact that
the scheme of M. Hanotaux, French Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, for the adjustment
of Turkish nuances has been rejected by
Russia. Concerning this scheme the in
spired St. Petersburg Viedomosti iraukly
says:
"The French proposal to add a Russian
representative to the board cl commis
sioners of the Ottaman debt would be
dearly bought by the sacrifice of Russia's
present exclusive control of Constan
tinople. Ti.e lead taken by tbe late
Prince Lobanoff has been followed by M.
Nelidoff, who has succeeded in wiping out
every European influence ia Turkey.
With England set aside, the Dreiband
now here and the Czar lord paramount at
the Yildiz Kiosi:a, why should Russia do
anything except waits. Instead |of ventur
ing unon war she will be able to dispose at
her pleasure of all tbe resources of Turkey
and garrison the forts of tue Dardanelles
at will and use the name of the Sultan as
Caliph in operating upon ihe Moslems in
Egypt."
TueNovo Vremya, another inspired St.
Petersburg journal, in an article express
ing similar views, says:
"The policy of Russia is not to support
the action of the other powers, but to en
force her own wiil. No matter what
massacres of Armenian and other Chris
tians may occur, the isolated action of
Russia is a practical reality."
The Berlin Government is fully aware
that thiÃ is the policy of Russia, and is
holding aloof while awaiting develop
ments, Germany well knowing that Aus
tria is ready to strike at an opportune
moment to check the ascendency of Rus
sia in Turkay. The sum of the prc-seut
position is that the Porte, backed by Rus
sia, will continue to play its old game of
de.irsive reforms with impunity.
Commenting upon the enormous ex
ports from Germany to the United Stat s
of artificially prepared wines and inferior
spirits and beers, the Berlin Neuste Nach
richten says that since the passage of the
wine act by the Reichstag in April, 1892,
in regard to the adulteration oi wines and
alcoholic beverages, immense quantities
of liquors have been brought into the
market under the name of wines at such
low prices as to prove it impossible that
they could have been prepared in accord
ance with the law.
"A certain Rhenish firm," the paper
says, "sells annually thousands of casks
of wine in the composition of which there
cannot possibly be anything beyond a
nominal percentage of grape wine, and
other instances of the production of abso
lutely artificial wiaes might be given to
the exhaustion of tue capacity of our
columns."
Tbe Nachricl:ten demands the enact
ment of some remedial legislation imme
diately, and suggests the passage of a law
imposing a heavy tax upon wine manu
facture.
The congress of the Christian Socialists,
which has been in progress at Erfurt for
several.days, attracted considerable atten

the del';gat a s b.came apparent. Pastor
Nauman, who has now entirely disasso
ciated himself from Dr. Btoecker, formerly
court chaplain and the head and front of
Cm ist.an socialism, delivered a Jong and

ct a new church, which should be free
from dogma. The Christian Socialists:, he
said, w,;uld yet march shoulder to shoul
der wiin the Social Democrats in support
ot a svscpm of universal conscription, an
increase : of the German fleet and the pol
icy of German colonial 'â xp.insioii. Th;
impressiun left by the congres< is that the
Christiaiii Socialist party will ni'ver attain
politica. importance, there being no unity
of opinion within its ranks. Mo^t of the
resolution! adopted were passed by the

WITH "TYPHUS ANTI-TOXINE."
Experiments That Reveal Some Valuable
Discoveries in Reference to In
fectious Diseases.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 29.â
United States Consul George Sawter at
Glochau sends to the Department of
State the following account of a report
soon to be published in a German medi
cal journal ijy Professor R. Pfeipper and
Dr. W. Kolle, two well-known bacteriolo
gists of B rlin, giving the effect oi" a num
ber of experiments they have made with
a "typhus anti-toxine."
"If their hopes are confirmed," says the
Consul, "the science of therapeutics in
infectious diseases will have received an
other valuable accession in this new dis
covery. The two experimenters believe
that exemption from typhus germs, like
immunity from cbolera germs and other
contagious diseases of like character, may
be traced back to the existence in the
blood of anti-typfioid substances, and
from this standpoint the very successful
results of the investigations have been
gained.
That this theory is most important and
practical is realized when the vitality of
the typhus bacillus, as discovered by
Koch, Eberth and Klebs, is given consid
eration. The typhoid bacillus is known
to exist largely in well nnd sprinc water,
and the fact that they aro frequently the
direct cause of infection is widely rrcog
nized by authorities on bacteriology.
Consequently this latest very important
discovery is to be greeted with j>>y, as it
may prove in the future tbe means of pre
servine numberless lives from untimely
demise, particularly as man is susceptible
to attacks irom the bacilli during the best,
years of his developmentâ 2o and 25 years.
The inoculations of typhus antf-tox:ne
can be easily and quickly executed and
will prove of great value and benefit, espe
cially in times of epidemic, when the need
of a prompt efficacious life-saving remedy
is most urgent. The entire fruits of the
experiments will soon be published for the
benefit of the medical world.

Poison id g.
Mrs. M. H. Carew Accused of
Causing Her Husband's Death
With Arsenic
If the Clnrga is True the Woman
Must Have Plotted With
Marvelous Ingenuity.
TOKIO, Japan, Nov. 16.â Baron Iwa
saki, one of the wealthiest Japanese mil
lionaires, has accepted the position of pres
ident of the Bank of Japan, in succession
to Baron Kawada. who died quite sud
denly in Osaka. Baron Iwasaki is well
known to all foreigners in Japan and to
many outside Japan, especially Amer
icans. He owns coal ininps, dockyards, a
bank, extensive house property and some
6,000,000 yen worth of the Japan Mail
Steamship Company's shares, besides
beinjr actively engaged in many other en
terprises. His acceptance of the presi
dency of the bank has surprised tbe pub
lic and is universally regarded as a fresh
proof of the cloie relations existing be
tween the present Prime Minister, Count
Matsukata, and the principal business
| men in the country.
Mrs. M. 11. Carew has oeen arraigned in
Yokohama on the charge of poisoning her
husband, who died recently from the
effects of arsenic. The case promises to be
one of the most sensational on record, un
less Mr. Carew poisoned himself, an al
most untenable hypothesis. For if the
defense set np he proved false, and if Mrs.
Carew be found guilty, it will follow that
the crime was plotted with marvellous in
genuity, and that before the poison began
to be a<! ministered, measures to cover up
the tracks of the criminals had been fully
planned and put into operation. Opinions
arc divided in Yokohama, but many re
fu.e to believe in the widow's guilt, and
two of the mo 1 prominent British resi
dents have appeared as her sureties. Mrs.
Caraw'a family occupy a hij;h position in
Glastonbury, Somersetshire, of which
place her father is Mayor.
She has shown remarkable self-posses
sion" throughout nh the painful incidents
since her husband's death, and has sub
mitted with much fortitude to long and
painful examinations and cross-examina
tions. But during the proceedings in
c urt on the 14th in3t., an incident oc
curred that has produced an impression
very damaging to her. A number of
documents that had been received in evi
dence at the inquest and subsequently
transmitted to Ihe court, were hatultd to
her counsel, at his request, for examina
tion. This waÂ« during a brief recens taken
'by ihe court. When the Judjre resinned
hispince on the bench, the clerk ot the
j court stated that one of the documents
was miasing. Thereupon the doors wenÂ»
closed, and ufter various inquiries here
and tbere. Mrs. Carew was finally
searched, when the document was found
between the cloth sleeve of her dres3 and
the crape cuff.
A resolute attempt has been made by
certain Japanese publications to discredit
the Minister of the Imperial Household.
Their object is to brine about his
resignation, for they believe that a
great part of Marquis Ito's politi
cal influence is due to the facil
ity with which he obtains audience of the
Sovereign, and much of that facility they
attribute to the connivance of the Minis
ter of the Household. Tiiey have not hes
itated to charge the latter with corruption,
abuse of power and successful attempts to
hoodwink the Emperor. This campaign
has failed almost completely, but has been
the means of eliciting some interesting
facts. For example, it appears that rix of
the Meiji statesmen have attained posi
tions carrying with them the privilege of
being received in audience whenever they
visit the palace; that poliical topics are
tabooed at these audiences, except on
very special occasions; that every
peer has the right of memorial zing
the throne, and that, if so de
sired, his memorial must pass sealed into
the Sovereigns-hands; that His Majesty
has eighteen -n. wsprrpers submitted daily
for his ins|>ectionâ among which the only
English joiunal is tbe Japan Mailâ and
iha: the Empress peruses 8; that two
Chamberlains always attend the debates
in the Diet and carry reports direct to the
Sovereign; and that, in consideration of
ins splendid services during the war,
M:\rq.iis Ito received a donation oi 100,000
yen irc-m the Imperial pnrse.

Some embarrassment exists with regard
to the revised treaty between Japan and
Germany. The treaty provides that, from
the dare of thf> exchange of ratifications,
German subjects in Japan shall enjoy the
privileges conferred by the Japanese law
of patents, trade marks and designs. But
no provision has been .made with reference
to the administration of the law. Punitive
clauses are, of course, rmtoilied in the
law, and should be inticte I azainst any
one guilty of infractions. But the Ger- !
man rons. Uar courts lyive no competence
to enfone the observance of such a law,
and the J ipanese courts will n<>: acquire
jurisdiction ovr Germans until 1899. 1 hen
the revised treaties are to go into opera
tion. In practice the omission is of no
great consequence, since German subjects
are most unlikely to violate' Japanese
patents or trade marks. But the affair
will probably involve the resignation or
recall of Viscount Aofci, the Japanese
Minister in Berlin, who negotia ed the
treaty.

A>. the text of Japan's new commercial
treaty with China contains nothing relat
ing to the former's abandonment of the
manufacturing privilege secured by the
Sbioiouoseki treaty it was at xirst supposed
that the Shimonoseki treaty would hold
a ter all and that articles manu.actured in
China by Japanese or other loreigners
wouid- rank with imported goods, and
would constantly be free from any special
taxation. But a protocol has now been
published in which the Japanese Govern
ment distinctly concedes China's rich lo
ta * articles manufactured by Japanese
subjects in China provided only that such
tax shall not differ from or exceed the im
post paid by Chinese manufacturers.
Ihu- Japan has explicitly renounced that
particular privilege. Had she not done so
a nice question migut possibly have
arisen.
It might have been claimed that Japan's
failure to avail herself of ail the provisions
of t c Shimonoseki treaiv did not disqual
ify other powers from taking everything
that the treaty gave, such action being
based on their most favored nation right.
But the protocol jus; concluded in Peking
virtually abrogates the free-manufacture
clause and dispose* finally of any question
in that sense. As for the compensation
obtained by Japan â namely, special' sites
for Japanese settlements In Shanghai,
Tientsin, Amoy and Hankowâ it is evi
dently viewed by the Japanese with
much satisfaction.' Until quite recently,
the only powers having settlements
of their own at Chinese open ports were
England and France. Germany made a new
departure last year by applying for aud
obtaining a site for herself in Tientsin,
the success of her demand beinc attributed
by many persons to the service she had
rendered to China in assisting to drive
Japan. out of Liaotung. But Japan will
now stand on the same level as these
creat powers in the matter of settlements-
Ihere can be no doubt mat her position
will be greatly improved in Chrie?e eyes,
and that her commercial opportunities
will be increased.
Some American newspapers appear to
be provided, just now, with correspond
ents in Japan, who forward information
manufactured out of whole cloth. Re
cently the American pub.'icwpre informed
that the town of Kobe had been wiped out
by a confljgration, but Kobe stands to
this day, unharmed by an such catas
trophe.
A later tale represented Japan in the
clutchcb of such a terrible latnine that the
Japanese Government had i-sued permis
sion to destitute parent* to sell their
daughters. The fabricator of this vil
lainous lis wen ton to detail the provisions
Â«f a law said to have bÂ°en enacted on the
subject, and cave the prices for which
eir.B were selling, with various other de
tails equally false. Thy only way of ac
coumine for this extraordinary series of
falsehoods is that their concoctor con
founded Japan with a province of China,
where the sale of girls is said to have been
resorted to recently by parents reduced to
the verge of starvation. Even that hy
pothesis, however, does not cover the cor
respondent's deliberate inventions about
the aelails of the so-railed law.

STRIKE OF THE
DOCK LABORERS
Employers and Employes
Are Both Confident of
Success.
Warehouse Workers at Ham
burg Join the Men Who
Are Battling.
There Has Been a Griat Delay to
Chartered Vessels, and Demand*
for Damages Will Follow
HAMBURG. Germany, Nov. 29.â The
strike of the dock laborers and others era
ployed in the shipping trade continues,
and both employers and men express
themselves confident of success. There is
no sign of a break in the ranks of tbe
strikers, notwithstanding the importation
of foreign labor.
The leaders of the strike are working
hard to secure the adhesion of all tho
dock, harbor and warehouse employes,
and huve succeeded in gaining many ac
cessions to their number?. The ware
house men and the men employed in the
granaries decided at meetings held to-day
to join the strike in order to procure bet
ter wages fcf themselves and incidentally
to help the men already out.
The strike is causing much delay in the
shipment of water-borne freights. The
sheds are mon- than full of goods await
ing shipment, but there is no telling when
the accumulation will Â«o forward. Many
of the new men that have been employed
are not at all skilled in tho work, and this
adds very materially to the delay in load
ing and discharging vessels.
It is believed that the claims of chartered
vessels lor damage wiil be large, and if
these are conceded or enforced a heavy ad
ditional expense will be entailed by the
shipping men.
The Hamburg Nachrichten accuses En
glish influences with causing the strike,
and asks the members of the various ath
letic unions to take the places of strikers.
A dispatch received here from Stock
holm says that the dock laborers' union
there held a meeting to-day and decided
that its members should not discharge
cargoes from Hamburg that are loaded by
black laborers.
Emperor William has ordered that a
detailed report be made to him of the
causes and extent of the strike.
Thus far the men on strike have be
haved in an orderly manner, but it is evi
dent that the ship-owners anticipate
trouble of some kind, for they have re
quested the naval authorities at Kiel to
send marines here.

"I don't know just how to turn at this

the contest off at Coney Island, and I shall:.

matters up and show the police we do not

"However, I have every hope of meet
ing Fitzsimmons in this vicinity. Why,
I was offered a $27,000 purse to-night to \
box Fitzsiiumons on Broadway, and later j
lia<i an increased offer from another or

think we are worth more than that, and I
propose giving other people a fair chance

fore Stuart's club as a last resort.
"Just to show Fitzsimrnons I have no

DESCRIBES THE
DYING SYMPTOMS
Strange Suicide of a Young
Man in a Chicago
Hotel.
Takes an Ounce of Laudanum
and Then Writes About
Its Effects.
First Destroys All Marks on His
Clothing That Might Lead to
Identification.
CHICAGO, Ixx., Nov. 29.â After de
stroying all marks on Mb clothing which
could in any way lead to his identifica
tion, a well-dressed man about 30 years
old committed suicide at the Kimball
Hotel, 262 Clark street, last night, by tak
ing poison. He described the effects of
the drug in writing until his hand could
no longer hold the i>encil. The body was
not 'found until late this afternoon, death
having resulted some time previously. In
his efforts to destroy any clew which
might lead to his identification he forgot
two articles which indicate that he was
from the East. A small mirror found in
the hand of the dead man bears the stamp
of a firm in Rochester, N. V., and the
memorandum-book In which he described
the manner of his death contains the
trademark of A. W. McCloy & Co., 443
Wood street, Pittsburg, Pa.
The police believe that he has lived in
one or the other of these two cities and
that the existence of the two articles will
eventually lead to his identification. The
trademarks on his clothing, even to his
hat and shoes, were effaced. He engaged
a room at the hotel last evening and regis
tered as E. L. Bryan, although the po
lice are of the opinion that this is not his
name. When found the body was lying
diagonally across the bed and the mem
orandum-book and pencil were near by,
having evidently fallen from hiÃ hand.
Before taking the drug he wrote a let
ter to the hotel proprietor and another to
the press, in which he gave no cause for
his act other than that bis life had ter
minated in failure. In both those letters
he had some humorous remarks.
He continued his description of the ef
fects of the drug until his strength bad
failed him and some of the last of it could
not be deciphered. As much of it as could
be made out is as follows:
'â¢To M. D.^Drank one ounce of laud
anum. After five minutes feel little or
no pain. Heart action now pronounced.
A slight pain in stomach.
"(Note) â My stomach is very week; hav
ing suffered for years from actue dyspep
sia.
"Ten minutes â Condition alicut the
satfne. Pulse rapid and pains in wrists
and slight pain in region of heart. Hand
trembles. A feeling of dullness with more
pain in all parts uf the budv.
."(Note) â Will keep up this description
o\ effects as long as possible. Hope it will
be of use to medical science. Eyes show
change. A feeding of drowsiness corning
on. A sort of a feeling of intoxication ac
companied" by slight fever.
"20 rain. âPain increasing. A slight
perspiration started. Am getting sleepy.
Have a sort of numb feeling and no pain."
The last few seritences were scarcely
legible, so unsteady had the writer's hand
become, and although he attempted to
write a few more lines it could not De made
out.
The clothing of the dead man was of
good material and the police think that
he may be well connected. No money
was found. He was about 30 years of age,
5 feet 9 inches tall and weighed about 150
pounds. He was smooth shaven and had
brown hair and blue eyes.
The words of the final bulletin became
larger as the end of the bulletin was
nearert. They were scrawled so as to be
almost beyond deciphering, and their
completio.n was evidently tue final effort
of the fiuicide. The other statements
which weie in the memorandum were un
doubtedly written before the drug had
been taken, as they were in a clear, bold
hand. The letter to the hotel proprietor
reads: . â¢
"7\> the Man thai keeps the hotel â Dear
Sir: I am awfui sorry to cause you this
annoyance. You will get some undesira
ble advertising out of it, and upon the
whole it won't pay you. Still such things
must occur sometimes. In o all sincerity I
hope you won't think I would nave
harmed your hou<e forÂ«any motive except
accident. Regretting the trouble I cause
you and trusting that you will regard the
incident as trilling, I am, sir, with deep
regrets, no more. E. L. Bryan.
'â¢No relation of W. J."
THe man started lo write a second letter
In the notebook, but changed his mind
after starting it, scratched it out with his
lead pencil and recommenced on a hotel
letter-head. The letter is as follows :
"7Vj cji.v Old Authority, Newspaper, (kro
ner, etc. : Tllis is just a case of â¢shuttling off
this mortal coil,' or attemptine to do so,
for one can never be sure* that the most
carefully laid plans will be successful and
this, like almost every act of myiife, is
carpiÂ»ss and bundling so far.
"Who ami? My name is on the regis
ter downstairs. I have no friends. â¢ lam
glad of that, for there will be .no mourners.
Byron said his one regret was that he left
nothing that caused a tear. My case is
the same, but I don't regret it at all.
People die sometimes atid others are glad.
Well, I am glad that in my case nobody
will be made either happy or unbappy .
"Do with meâ oh, most anything. Just
don't bother to look for .'rienda. You
could not find any with a searchlight or
microscope. Of course the reason I haveirt
any friends is because I've been bad.
Well, maybe so, maybe not. The world is
a big place. Students of right and wrong
are different. Circumstances often com
pel action without consulting diseases. I
have known both success and failure,
tasted life* sweetest and bitterest -portions
and drained them to the dregs.
"The rap of life at the threshold of ex
istence, hopelessly handicapped by bad
health, by injustice and by disappoint
ment, I give up the struggle. I die be
cause I cannot live. Please leave me alone
just as I am. 1 have drunk* one ounce of
laudanum. I presume this will be
enough." â¢
On the cover oT tne memorandum book
was fcund the name of the firm of A. W.
McCloy & Co., PiUsburg, from whom it
had been purchased. From this it is
thought by the Central police that the
man may have come from Pittsburg. This
is the only clew to his Lome, as he came
to the Kimball Hotel on Saturday after
noon at 5 o'clock and registered as E. L.
Bryan, giving his address as Chicago.
He was shown to a room on the second
floor. This was at 5:30 o'clock on Satur
day evening and he was not seen alive
after this.
The man appeared to Clerk Cathcart to
be nervous, but nothing was thought of
his manner. He was well dressed, wear
ing a black diagonal suit. The first sus
picion that something was wrong was
raised when the housekeeper noticed the
light burning in his room.
She notified Manager E. F. Sweet, who
went to the room with a porter. The door
was locked. As it was next to the fire
escape the porter was directed to climb to
the room by this means.
Lying stretched out on the outside of
the bed was Bryan, dressed. The body
was taken to Robinson's undertaking
rooms on Adams street.
It is now thought the suicide's name
waa Edgar Lytle, supposed to be from
Pittsburg. To-night an express receipl
was found which showed that E. L. Bryan
had shipped by the Adams Express from
Pittsburg, Pa., November 18, one telescope
valise to Chicago.
The Adams Express office in this city
was visited to-night and the valise be
longing to the dead man was found. It was
opened and found to contain, beside a
quantity of clothing, an excellent photo
graph of the dead man and a number of
visiting cards engraved "Edgar Lytle."
One suit of clothes was made by Pitts
burg tailors and another by Burton C.
Stout, Wheeling, W. Ya. Both coats bore
the name of Edgar Lytle on a tab under
the collar.
While there were no letters or papers of
any kind in the valise tbe marks on the
clothing ana the photograph and cards of
the dead man made it apparent that he
was Edward Lytle, and not E. L. Bryan,
as his- signature on the hotel register
would indicate.

say, Miss \Virt was unhurt in falling.
Upon returning to the surface of the water
she clung to the sides of the well for
nearly a half-hour until help arrived,
when she was quickly hoisted to tlie sur
face.

STONED TO DEATH
BY HIGHWAYMEN
Louis Maverick Slain by
Two Negro Desperadoes
for Robbery.
Capture and Confession of One
of tbe Criminals Cause
Wild Excitement
Strategy and Prompt Action by Officers
Prevents a Storming of the
Jail and Lynching.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 29.â Louis Maver
ick, the proprietor of a boarding camp on
the drainage canal near Lemont, was
attacked by two colored highwaymen in a
deserted portion of Summitt, soutnwest of
this city last night, robbed and stoned to
death.
The crime resulted in the wildest excite
ment at Lemont, and hundreds of citizens
started out to assist the police in capturing
the men. This afternoon Henry Rooker
and John Lattimer, both negroes, were
arrested on the drainage canal not far
from Summitt and lodged in jail. Rooker
afterward confessed, and when this was
rumored about, a mob collected and it
was with difficulty that the authorities
protected the prisoner from violence.
The excited citizens threatened to force
an entrance into the jail where the two
men were locked up and lynch them. The
streets in the vicinity of the jail
growing crowded with excited men, and
the authorities fearing that violence
would be committed, separated the two
prisoners. Rooker was hurried out through
a rear way and taken to the Willow
Springs jaii, and in order to quiet the mob
it was aiven out that there was no certainty
of the guilt of the prisoners. By 10 o'clock
the crowd bad dispersed.
Last evening Maverick, accompanied by
his nephew, was walking along a tow path
in Summitt. Rooker ana Lattimer, who,
i.t is claimed, were concealed behind some
shrubbery, attacked them- and began beat
ing them with stones. Maverick r s nephew
fled, but the latter received a blow on the
bead which rendered him senseless. As
soon as the police were notified of the
assault they went to where Maverick was
wbeu the attack was made and found his
body lying across the path. His head
and body were severely bruised where he
had been peijed with the stones. Officers
and citizens were sent in every direction
and Rooker and Lattimer were captured.
The nepnew of the dead man identified
them and when Roofcer was confronted
with this he gave up and made a full con
fession. He charged Lattimer with hav
ing killed Maverick, and admitted that
they divided $30, the proceeds of the
robbery.
LIME POINT BATTEEY.
Inspection of the Works by General
Forsythâ Another Fort on Tn.it
Side of the Channel.
General James W. Forsyth, TJ. S. A.'
(commanding the Department of Cali
fornia), Colonel A. S. Kimball (quarter
master), Major Davis (Engineer Corps)
and Lieutenant J. l-'ranklin Bell (staff of
General Forsyth) boarded the Govern
ment "steamer McDowell' yesterday and
paid a visit to the new fortifications at
Lime Point. One twelve-inch breech
loading rifle is already mounted there,
on.l another gun of the same pattern is on
the ground and wiil soon be placed in
position. The subject of caring for the
fortifications in the absence of a regular
garrison was considered.
The engineer examined and selected the
ground for two more forts on that side of
the channel, but lor good and sufficient
reasons it is deemed best to keep the exact
location a secret at the present. It is pro
posed, however, to carry out the vast
scheme of harbor defence as adopted by
tue War Department and render San
Francisco impregnable from attacks by
sea.
The Army and Navy Journal is informed
that the jeasons for sending artillery to
Angel Island and infantry to the Presidio
were personal ones. It is observed by the
same paper that there was not the slight
est military necessity for the change.
Officers stationed at San Francisco do
not care to discuss the subject. Reference
is" made to the fact that the order direct
ing the change came from the War De
partment. The personal reasons sug
gested by the Army and Navy Journal
are not explained. It is surmised that
General Miles, commanding the army,
desired to make Colonel Shafter's posi
tion as pleasant as possible, hence the
transfer of infantry companies to the Pre
sidio. Colonel Shatter therefore, by vir
tue of his rank, becomes post commander.
An officer who is weli posted says that
tlie department ha 9 decided to fortify
Angel Island and place there the largest
of modern guns. Should this scheme be
carried out reasons for sendiing artillery
companies to the island would ba obvious.
Last Saturday Colonel Shafter occupied
the house 'at the Presidi6 in which Gen
eral Graham lived for so many years.
Mrs. Shafter was conveyed irorii "Black
Point to the Presidio on tnat day. The
new post commander is therefore duly
installed.
Lieutenant Sydney A. Clornan, U. S. A.,
who was recently promoted and trans
ferred from the First to the Fifteenth In
fantry, left for Zanesville, Ohio, on a three
months' leave of absence last (Saturday
evening. Mr, rioinau received a memo
>able "send off" at the Presidio Club.
Songs of the service of cadet life and of
Bohemian Club jinks were aung. The
Bohemian Club sent out M. 11. .Weed,'
Laurie Bunton, Clarence Bickford, Thomas
P. Ruhm, IT. Bi N., and W. B. Hopkins to
bring the young officer to the Owl's sanc
tuary before he left California. In front
of the Presidio Club the First Infantry
band played, and in the ciubroonis Mr.
Cloman's fellow-officers of the First gave
him many pledges of good will. Colonel
Shafter spoke some kind and eloquent
words to Mr. Cloman, referring to the
latter:* meritorious service at Pine Ridge.
The friendly rivalry existing between
the companies of the First IntarUry and
the batteries of the Third Artillery will
give special interest to the events of the
field day at the Presidio next Friday.
The exercises will beuin at 9 a. m. and
close at 4 r. m. Among tha scheduled
events are: IOU-yard dash, 220-yard dash.
440-yard running race, pole vault, putting
the shot, hammer-throwing; tng-of-war,
two infantry and two artillery teams, win

SELL CHILDREN
INTO SLAVERY
Manchuria's Starving Peo
ple Trade Their Young
for Food.
Poverty and Famine Cause the
Revival of an Inhuman
Practice.
Brokers Grow Rich Through De
testable Trafficking in Human
Sou's.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 29.â The steamer
Howick Hali has arrived from Shanghai
bringing news of the revival of a terrible
practice by farmers inhabiting tbe plains
region of Manchuria. Their poverty was
greatly increased by the Chino-Japanese
war, and Liter tribal wars buve decimated
their numbers and reduced them to posi
tive want. The .result has been the re
newal of the ancient custom oi selling
their children to slave brok rs.
. "In the original purchase girls from sto
12 years of age are sold for sums equiva
lent to one or two shillings each. By the
brokers they are resold for from four to
eight shillings. The experiences tbat be
fall the children at the hands of the tiad
ers cause them to live in imense dread of
their owners, so that whenever they are
disobedient the threat that they will be
handed back to taeir brokers is sufficient
to render them entirely docile. The
money "which the farmer-* receive for their
children is spent for foou or seed grain.
The children are taken off to town's
where scores of Uiem ara collected and
trained to sing and dance. The prettiest
girls are taken in small parties to seaport
cities of China, where vigorous efforts are
'made to keep secret the nefarious traffic.
Some of these girls, it is learned, are.
taken to India and as far as Constantino
ple. As a rule they are pretty, having
oval faces, large bodies and fair complex
ions. The plainer girls and boys are
trained to work and sold to wealthy peo
ple in Manchuria and surrounding prov
inces.
Many heartrending scenes are reported
from ttie slave markets. Mothers plead to
be sold with their children, and there are
;â¢ girls who prefer death to the life they
know ia in store for them. Others take
their Jsellin-j into siavery as a matter of
course and make no complaints. They
are better fed and dressed by the slave
brokers than by their parents.
Missionaries in the coast provinces have
recently received detailed reports of the
detestable traffic. They a r e preparing to
send some of their members into Man
churia to aid in suppressing it. It is the
general opinion umorg thorn that radical
measures must be taken to induce the
Chinese Government to aid the Manchur
ian farmers.
SAN BERNARDINO ACCIDENT.
J. W. Harris of Co/ton Fails Under the
Wheels of a Wagon and Is Crushed
to Death.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Nov. 28.â
J. W. Harris of Colton was thrown from
his wagon last evening as he was driving
homeward from this chy and killed. The
accident occurred a lew Hundred yards
â  Delow the E-street station of the Santa
Fe, about 6 o'clock. T:tns driver of a deliv
ery wapon was delivering groceries when
he discovered the body of a man lying on
the motor track. Thinking that the pros
trate man must be intqxicated, and Know
ing that the" motor train was almost due
. he stopped his horse stnd stooped over to
lilt Harris from the rails when he discov
. ered that instead of being intoxicated he
was seriously hurt and unconscious. He
placed the injured man in the wagon and
drove at once to the City Hall, where an
improvised bed was 'made for the injured
man.
Physicians were summoned, andan ex
amination showed that the wheel of a
heavily loaded wagon nad passed across
Harris' chest, crushing the ribs and spine.
Not from the time of discovery until he
breathed his last, at 9:30 o'clock, did Har
ris regain consciousness. A hack was sent
to Colton for his wife, daughter and son,
and they remained at the stricken man's
side until the la t watching his labored
breathing and hoping for some sign of
recognition, which never came.
A short time before 6 o'clock Harris was
seen driving from this city with a heavy
load of lumber. It is supposed that he
fell from the wagon at the place where
found and that the rear wheel passed over
him. In a few minutes more the motor
tra r in would have passed over him, and
the real cause of his death would probably
nsver have been known.

CLAKAMAS FISH EXTERMINATED.
Hundreds of Thousands of Young Salmon
in the Hatchery Die in Poisoned
" . Waters'
OREGON CITY, Ok., Nov. 29.â While
the workmen at the Clakamas hatchery
were ai supper to-night all of the live
salmon that were in the hatching trays
were killed. About 600,000 were destroyed,
but how or by whom is unknown. It is
suspected that the water was poisoned.
Some of it has been saved for an analysis,
though most of the water in which the
lish died had escaped before the sample
was taken. A few tests have been applied
to the water that was saved without dis
covering the nature of the poison.
These make 1,600,000 young salmon that
have died at the hatchery this month.
About a month apo several hundred thou
sand young fish were killed in a rnysrerous
manner. Superintendent Hubbard pro-
Jesses to ba in ignorance of the cause of
killing of the fish. An investigation may
be instituted by the United States au
thorities.
NEW EPISCOPAL YEAR.
.Confirmation Service* Yesterday at the
Church of the Advent.
Yesterciay, the first Sunday in Advent,
was the beginning of the new year in the
affairs of the Protestant Episcopal denom
ination, and the occasion was observed in
all the churches of that faith.
In the Church oi the Advent, on Elev
enth street, near Alark'et, a number of
young people were confirmed at the close
of the morning services. The rites of con
firmation were celebrated by Right Rev.
William Ford Nichol?, Bishop of the dio
cese, assisted by Rev. James A. Emery,
the rector. Rev. Hobart Chetwood, Rev.
Henry B. Menses and Rev. K. N. Mikami
of the Episcopal Japanese Mission.
There were twenty-one persons of both
sÂ«xes confirmed, among whom were five
young Japanese irom the mission.
The services, whicii were very impres
sive, were opened by the rector, Mr.
Emery, followed by a full sarpliced choir
of thirty-eipht male voices in the hj run,
"The Lord i-s in His Holy Temple." Then
followed the lesson by Rev. Mr. Chetwoud,
and the prayer by R*v. Mr. Menses. The
obligations aud "invocations of tbe con
firmation were administered by Bishop
Nichols to the candidates kneeling at the
chancel rail. In his eloquent address he
spoke of the necessity of their vigilance
In the new line as neophites in the church
that they might live conscientiously.
â¢'Conscience, however," said he, "will
not exist without effort any ruore than the
mind will expand without proper train
ing. As the mental is nurtured in tbe
school, so is the conscience nurtured in
the church. In unholy environments
conscience becomes weak and speaks
faintly to the wrongdoer. So, in the be
gin siing of this, our new church year,
start forward to a richer and higher Chris
tian experience. "
At the close of the ftymn, "My Faitn
Looks Up to Thee/ the benediction was
pronounced and the congregation was dis
missed.
THE FEAST OP DEDICATION.
To Be Observed by the Jewish Congre
gations During the Week.
Yesterday was the first day of the He
brew-Chanucha festival, or, as it is freely
rendered in English, "The Feast of Dedi
cation," and sometimes "The Feast of
Lights." It will oe observed throughout
the seven days of the week.
The Chanucna festival is not properly
religious in character, and has the very
reverse of a melancholy signification. It
is, in fact, the commemoration of an
eyent in Jewish historyâ the victory of
Judas Maccabeus over Antiochus, Kin<*
of Syria. That autocratic monarch deÂ°
fired the Jews to worship his* favorite god
Jupiter and sought to desecrate the Jewish
temple at Jerusalem by removing the
symbols of the Hetrew faith" and substi
tuting therefor a golden image of the
Grecian deity.
Judas Maccabeus, the valiant champion
of the Jewish people, resorted to the ar
bitrament of battle and overcame Antio
chus. The temple was subsequently re
dedicated on tiie 25th day of Kislev, as it
is called in the Jewish calendar. The
holy oil was replaced and the lights re-lit,
and hence the name the anniversary of
that occasion bears.
The observance of the Chanucha festival
assumes a simple but poelic form. , Every
household is illuminated throughout the
week, commencing with one light the
first day, until on the seventh and last
thert. are *eve:i lights burning. Apart
from this peculiar ceremonial the week is
given up to the pleasures ol social inter
course and reciprocal hospitality. In ad
dition to the regular services next Friday
the Ciiy synagogues will present specially
prepared programmes during the week in
which the children of the congregations
will take a prominent part.
At the Geary-street Temple, of which
Dr. M. S. Lsyy is the rabbi, the annual
exhibition will be heid. commencing at 7
o'clock. Tbe Chanucha hymn will be sung
by the congregation; a farce entitled
"The Masked Ball" will then be pre
sented, followed oy the children's doll
drill and a tableau vivant entitled
"\Y omen of Israel." The annual distribu
tion of medals and prizes will afterward
take place. Dr. Levy has chosen for his
lecture "The Jew as a Soldier," in which
Judas Maccabeus will be referred to as the
ideal type. At the Te,mp!e Emanu-j-a on
Friday the children will be present aud
w.ll join In the singing. Rabbi Voor-
s nauress is entitled: "Maccabee
and Swords and the American Ballot."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1896.
VENTURA COUNTY'S
PRODUCTIVE SOIL
Grows Anything From the
Humble Bean to the
Banana.
Backed by a Climate Adapted
to ths Raising of AH
Kinds of Fruit.
Picturesque Beauty of San Buenaven
tura, the County's Seat of
Government.
FAN BUENAVENTURA, Cal., Nov.
28- â Ventura County has a frontage on the
Pacific Ocean of about seventy-five miles.
It is bounded east by Los Angeles County,
west by Santa Barbara County, north by
Kern County r.nd south by the Pacific
Ocean. There is perhaps no county in
the State that has so great a variety in soil
and climate. In the little valle} T s bark
from the coast it is both warmer and
colder than near the coast. These valleys
have the very best coil for oranges and
lemon*, while olives, â  prunes, grapes,
apricots, apples, peaches, walnuts and
pears flourish in the footnills. The
rich loam of the valleys near the ocean is
what has made Ventura County known as
the best section in the world for- beans.
Within the county lines are included
San Nicolas and Anacopa islands. Ana
copa is small and picturesque. It rises
sheer from the blue waters of the ocean,
and is crescent shaped, forming a beauti
ful harbor on the inner Bide, where the
waters gently wash the rugÃed walls and
fill the numerous coves that are the abode
of seals and sea lions. There is a sma;l
beach where pleasure parties are landed.
This island will soon become one of tbe
most popular pleasure resorts on the
coast. When the railroad to the cele
brated Ojai Valley shall have been com
pleted it is proposed by citizens of Ven
tura to build a hotel on Anacopa and run
a steam launch from Ventura and Huen
erne to the island.
All of the best food fishes are found in
abundance in the channel off Ventura,
Hueneme and Banta Barbara. The de
licious pompano is caught by local fisher
men and shipped to Los Angeles and San
Francisco. The establishment of can
neries iaan inviting field for capital.
Ventura County is one of the best
watered counties in the State. The
Santa Clara River traverses the entire
county from northeast to southwest and
is fed by numerous streams, chief of
which are the Sespe, Santa Paula and
Pira. The Ventura River, a beautiful and
rapid-flowing stream, noted as one of the
beat trout streams on the coast, rises in
the San Rafael range and flows nearly
due south to the ocean. The scenery
along the upper portions of this river is
grand. The water is pure and sweet and
in quantity sufficient to Bnpply a city of
75,000 inhabitants. It enters the ocean at
Ventura.
The soil of o Ventura County is very rich
and will grow anything from beans to
bananas. We raise wheat, corn, barley
oats, potatoes, and in beans 'we beat the
world. Our honey is unexcelled, and in
fruits .we raise oranges, lemons, limes,
apples, peaches, a pears,* prunes, apricots',
plums, olives, grapes, walnuts and all
berries.
Statistics of Droducts are tiresome and
cannot be given i n a short article. T-he
topography of the county is such that we
hnve climate suited to all kinds of fruits
Our oil fields are well known-and the yield
is enormous. We have a vast amount of
asphaltum of the best quality, gypsum
and an oil stone from which a fine quality
of toilet soap is made. Our. sandstone is
excellent for building purposes and in un
limited quantity.
Mr. CJaus Spreckels having received
samples of sugar beets raised in the Santa
Clara Valley came down la'ely to look the
field over and was so well pleased that he
proposes soon to erect a sugar factory in
or near Hueneme. When that industry
shall have been established no section of
the United States will offer greater in
ducements'to the farmer than Ventura
County, for with beans and sugar beets
he will grow rich.
When the South Pacific Coast Railroad
is finished 90 per cent of all the travel
from Los Anreles and tae southern
counties to San Francisco will be over that
route, for who will travel over interior
plains when they can breathe the sea air
and look from a car window out over the
ocean aud see the panorama of islands and
ships?
San Buenaventura, the county seat of
Ventura County, lies on a gentle blope
close to the sea. Protected from the
north winds by the mountain range and
facing the ocean, it looks off at the islands
that seem to float as in a mirage. The
Â»ea air is never hot and never cold. When
Cabnllo dropped anchor in the channel in
front of where Ventura now stands he
counted twenty-five Indian villasjes scat
tered alonj,' the coast foothills. Those old
time people knew a good thing when they
found it, and lived and died in this fa
vored spot. The town of San Buenaven
tura has about 1000 inhabitants, moÂ«tly
from the Eastern States. The old Mission
churrh is much tbe same to-day as when
the Indians came at the call of " the chime
of bells to receive blessings from the good
fathers.
There are two Methodist, one Presby
terian, one Congregat onal and one Chris
tian church, all in a flourishing condition.
The town has two tine public halls, three
excellent hotels, two fine public school
>uilding?, one small primary school build
ing, and plans are now beins drawn for a
?r.',000 or $15,000 high school building,
rhe town ewni its city hall and library
building, ana maintain! a free public
library of about 5000 voiumes. The reve
nue to support tLe library is derived from
taxation. There are four excellent news
papers, two banks, and all lines of mer
cantile houses where goods can be boueht
at Los Angeles prices. The streets are
lighted by arc light lamps, and offices and
residences with incandescent lamps.
There is an abundance of prsre water at
reasonable rates. All the principal streets
are graded and sidewalked. The public
sewer system covers most of the town
and is being exteuded yearly.
The assessed valuation of the town for
1898 is $1,272,407; the tax rate, 63 cents;
the bonded indebtedness is only $20,250.
The Ventura Agricultural Association has
an excellent mile race track with ample
box stalls and :.ne grand-stand in the
lower part of (fee town. The sea bathing
Is not equaled by any town on the coast
except Santa Barbara. In fact San Buena
ventura is strictly an up-to-date town
with all accessories to luxury and ease
and a climate unequaled even in Italy.
Santa Paula, the second towu of the
county, lies on the railroad sixteen miles
eastot Ventura. It is in the center of the
best farming land In the county and of the
oil and petroleum region. Santa Pauia is a
lively town, and is growing rap'idiy.

WAS JEALOUS OF
HIS YOUNG WIFE
Mrs. Kelly's Jovial Nature
Aroused Her Husband's
Suspicions.
Convinced That the Woman Was
Deceiving Him, He Fired
to Kill Her.
The Victim of the Sm Jose Tragedy
Is Recovering, but Her Assail
ant Will Die.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 29.â J. P. Kelly,
who attempted to kiil his wife and then to
end his own life when the police appeared,
is still alive at the Receiving Hospital,
despite the fact tbat the physicians state a
builet is embedded in his brain. Mrs.
Kelly is beinc nursed at her room in the
Raymond over the store whero the tragedy
took place, and in all probability she will
recover. She rested easily to-day. She
inquired about the condition of her hus
band and her children. Kelly was con
scious all day and also inquired about Irs
family. He was restless at times. He
took some nourishment, it is believed he
cannot live.
Jealousy was what caused Kelly \o at
tempt to kill his wife. He accused her of
being on intimate terms with other men.
Kelly v.as double the asre of the woman,
he being 54 years old and she but 25. The
woman was of a jovial disposition and had
a pleasant word for everybody and this
aroused Kelly's jealousy. Keliy was
morose and quiet. He treated the woman
cruelly. When he heard that she was
about to apply for a divorce the news so
enraged him, it is thought, that he
planned to kill her an d himself.
Kelly's story about the wealth he pos
sesses is believed to be imaginary. He
claims to own shares in the California
and Colorado Consolidated Tuixnei and
Mining Company of Leadville, Colo.,
valued at $175,000, and other mining stock
and real estate in this country and Aus
tralia, which would bring his wealth up
to $500,000. No credence is given to the
btory.
Hreamen an' Jn*ole*nt.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Nov. 29.â William
Peacock, a contractor and builder at Palo
Alto, has filed a petition in insolvency.
The liabilities aggregate $1653. Thera are
no available assets.
FALLS TO HIS DEATH.
George 31. Snaman Haiku Into an Open
ing in a sidete.ilk.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 29.â George M.
Seaman, who has been living at 105 Grant
street, was found dead in a basement of
the new Baker building, on the corner of
Third and Santa Ciara streets, about 12:30
o'clock to-day. He had fallen about
twelve feet onto a cement floor and his
neck wasbroken.
The opening through which Seamas fell
was right on the edge of the sidewalk and
was unguarded. It ia supposed he in
tended to emer the building. That he
was not held up by footpads and thrown
into the cellar is evidenced by the fact
that a watch and some money on his per
son were unmolested. He was a sober
and industrious man and not addicted to
drink.
The deceased was a native of New York,
aged 59 years. He leaves a widow in this
city. Seaman came to San Jo*e from San
Francisco about a year ago, and had been
liv.ng with and nursing George W. Lewis,
an old friend.
ROWING REGATTA.
SlcCausland , Defeats Dennis in the
. Senior Skiff Kneeâ South Ends'
. Reasons for Not It owing. .
A large crowd witnessed the postponed
races of the rowing regatta yesterday at
Long Bridge. \
The races 'to be ' contested were the
senior -four-oared : barge, the senior shell
and the race for old-time oarsmen.
1 The : South Ends declined to row the
Stocktons, and the Ariels, out of. courtesy
to the visiting oarsmen, paced them over
the course in 11:21. .
:i In the senior skiff race McCausland of
the Ariels defeated Dr. Dsnni3 of the Ala
medas by about six lengths. Their time
for the distance whs 11:37.
When asked after the race by the referee
if he r.ud any complaint to make Dennis
said, "Yes, the other fellow rowed too
fa3t."
McCausland is now the possessor of the
beautiful silver cups offered by Air. Brod
erick and Air. Phalan, having won the
senior scull from .Brown of Stockton and
the senior skiff from Dr. Dennis.
The old-timers' skiff race was a disap
pointment. Captain Thomas and Sullivan
withdrew, leaving Leander Stevenson and
Air. Grownej as the contestants. Grownev
won by two lengths in 13:04.
Stevenson complained that Growny
fou.ed;him in turning the stnkeboat. The
foul was not allowed, and as bo:h men
won prizes there was no ill fÂ«e.ing.
The recatia committee decided that
Captain Will Pate was justly entitled to
the gola medal offered by Roihkoph. as
he defeated bode and Breen on Thanks
giving day.
The following acted as officials: Referee
J. D. Gr.Uin; judges, Henry Hencemann
and W. B. Henchman; timekeeper, W.
Blake.
Captain Thomas when asked why his
cluo did not rr.ee, said:
"The South Ends have always done
their utmost to make regattas a success.
The club has always had a large number
of entries in tiie different events and I
might say. more thaa any other club.
We were ready to row on Thanksgiving
day and were very much disappointed
that the race waa put off. Tbe Stocktons
were certainly prepared ior rough water,
having had a washboard put on their new
boat, and as for our boat it is adaptable to
stnootli or rongli weather.
'"Then other clubs have abused tbe
South Ends and stories are in circulation
whicu are detrimental to the good oi the
club.
"The South Ends feel sore over the
charges made by the Stockton papers at
the time of the Admission day regatta
charirinc us with attempted bribery and
other terrible crimes in which there was
no truth.
"And on account of the abuse the South
Ends decided not to row. We are not iooÃ
ing for prizes, but we are looking out for
the reputation of the club.
"The club is ready at any time to meet
the Stockton crew or any other crew in a
match race.
"One ol the morning papers charges the
delay of the Thanksgiving races to the
regatta committee.
"It is an unjust charere as the committee
were at the starting point at 10:15 a. m.,
the time set for the regatta.
"The delay might be attributed to Mr.
Pembroke. He erred in taking too much
on liis own shoulders."

JUNIOR PATRIOTS 1 D.Y.
Rev. Frank Ford Talks to the
Young Men of the (Xd^r
of Mechanics.
Their Purposes Said to Conserve tbe
I Highest Ambitions of True
Am ricanism.
There was a Thanksgiving service of the
Junior Order of tbe United American
Mechanics at the First Chri-tian Church,
Twelfth and Howard street", last night.
The exercises consisted of singing and
an address by the pastor, Rev. Frank
Ford, whose text was "Watch Ye; Stand
Fast in the Faith," from the sixteenth
chapter of Corinthiana I.
The speaker surveyed in a general way
the great landmarks of American history,
concluding that the present generation is
rich in a great measure by reason of
heredity and environments. Conditions
of education, he held, were greatly re
sponsible for the progress of the age.
"The principles of the Junior Society."
said the speaker, "are such that any
thorough-going American can indorse
them. Tuese principles are concisely
and beautifully stated by the society it
self, and they embrace the widest ideas
uf liberty consistent with edacation, true
progress and the American idea of reli
gion. We believe in the.reading of the
English Bible in the public schools and
we believe in fostering American religion,
which is free. The Junior Order demands
the protection of children by just laws,
and is opposed to anything that tends,
even remotely, to warp the best ideas of
Americanism."
The speaker concluded by referring to
the creat and brilliant part played in
American history by young men and pre
dicted great success for the Junior Order.!

Major-General James, Adjutant-General
Barrett and Colonel Currier, division ad

and talked about " appropriations. The
Â». Legislature will be asked to appropriate
\ 578,000 for encampment expenses for two
years. It c m;y be deemed advisable to
consolidate; the allowance for two years
and expend tne entire sum in one division
encampment. Since the early "sixties"
â¢â  there has not been an encampment em
" bracing ail the troops of the State. During
Governor Markham's administration an
-.allowance of $70,000 was obtained for that
purpose, but the adjutant-general per
mitted' the brigade in Southern California
.- to draw its pro rata from the allowance
and iiold a= brigade encampment south of

Third Brigade. Â»
CHICO, Cal., Nov. 25. -Company A,'.
Second Regiment, held an election at the
armory this evening, in which ex-Captain
J. J. Cahill was elected. Captain Cahill
was in command of Company A some five
or six years ago and was then recognized
as one of tie ablest military men in the
old Eighth Regiment. After having
servpd in the capacity of captain for two
years he resigned and has since been dis
connected with the guard. Company A
is to !>e congratulated on the election of
Captain Cahill, for under his command it
will undoubtedly progress with great
rapidity. After the election the boys
assembled at Cooley's restaurant, where
an elaborate banquet was spread.
To-rnorrcw a team of thirty-one men
will go to Marysville to compete with an
equal number of men in that company.
Every one acquainted with the ability of
both companies anticipates a close contest
with a very high average to the man.
Company Cholds the championship over
the northern companies as a cract com
pany, but the A boys have been doing
'some hard and faithful practicing for the
past month and will undoubtedly do good
shooting.
WOODLAND, Cal., Nov. 27.âExcite
ment in military circles will be on the de
crease from now until the fifst of the new
year. The last drill of this year took place
tast Wednesday night. The last regular
business meeting will take place the last j
Wednesday of this month. The drill last
Wednesday evening was followed by a
grand Thanksgiving ball, given by Com
pany F, and was very well attended, when
ta&ing into consideration that several
other attractions were going on the same
evening.
The alterations in the armory that â¢were
spoken of some time ago are completed
ana add very much to the appearance of
the hall. Company F will soon be the
I most thoroughly equipped and comforta
bly housed company in the State.
The flagpole will be put up in a few days
and then Old Glory will be flung to the
breeze to wave over Company F's armory
for all time to come. "Captain Tommy,"
the company's eagle, takes as much in
terest in the improvements as any
member of the company.
Captain Prindle is out again and doing
his regular rustling to keep everything
j running smoothly for the company. Sev
! eral visiting members of N. G. C. have
| Deen here during the last weeK and were
i loud in their praises of the armory and
everything connected with it.
The recent emergency call of ere-
I ated no little excitement among the boys
las wcil as the public in general. The call
â¢ came at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and at
j 8 o'clock in the evening, when the roll
was called, 52 men out of 57 members
answered to their names. This is a grand
showing when taking into consideration
the fact that It was raining and blowing
and that not a few of the boys were work
ing out in the country.
The boys were ail ready to go on a
tramp, but were a little disappointed
when they found out that on!y an inspec
tion was on tap. The inspecting officer
was Lieutenant J. G. Lee of the colonel's
staff. : . . â¢:'
He gave the company a thorougn
overhauling and his report ought 10 go a
long way toward having this" company
thoroutrhly equipped for any kind of ser
vice, which at present it is not. A num
ber of guns were condemned and the
coofcing utensils were found short; also
blankets, xhe company will be lound
ready at any time lo anawer any and all
calls that may be made.
At the target practice several of
ihe boys made scores of from 4'J to4H.
The armory target is attracting considera
ble attention Jrom the boys at the pres
ent. The captain has had a 22 caliber
barrel put into a regular musket barrel,
and during the winter months target prac
tice can b? had in the morning. The gun
is the same weight ana has a six-pound
pull, the same as the other guns. Last
Wednesday evening private Capelle, while
shooting at 30 paces, snuffed a candle out.
WITH THE IR OWN PISTOL
Police Divisions Now Competing
for Three Valuable
Priz?s.
The Weapon Used Is the One the
Men Carry Daily in Their .

For several months pistol practice at
the police range in the basement of the
City Hall was stopped, but it has been re
sumed during the past week.
The reason is that a competition is now I
on in which every man in the department
is interested. Tiie prizes nre valuable and
there is the keenest rivalry amcug the
men to win them.
The former competition, which took all
last winter to decide, was among the men
of Captain Wittman's division. The
weapon used was the regular Smith &
Wesson .45-caliber. The prizes were a cold
medal for the highest scorer, a silver
medal for the next highest scorer and a
gold and silver medal for tne man wbo
showed the createst improvement during
the competition.
Policeman Smith Carr won the gold
meial with the highest score, Policeman
W. H. Hanley the cold and silver medal
and Policeman W. D. Scott the silver
medal.
The competition which is now gojng on
includes all the divisions. The weapon
used is. the pocket revolver carried by each
officer, and it will therefore be seen that
Hie result is being watched witn much
greater interest than the preceding one,
Irom the fact that the men are firing with
the revolvers they carry with tnem every
dny, and the whole department is compet
ing, with the exception of Smith Carr,
who is barred, as hu- is one of the best
revolver shots in the country and the
otberj would have in* chance aeainst him.
*or this competition the men are di
vided into sections. Each section com
petes at the range and tie highest scorer
is selected to compete in the final shoot
for the prizes. There are nineteen sec
tions altogether, ten in Captain Witt
man's division, four in Captain Spillane's
three in Captijn Gillen's and two in Cap
tain Dunlevy's. There will bo thus nine
teen men to compete in the final. Each
man will nre ten shots, the highest dos
sit'l^ score to be 50.
The prize* are a magnificent gold star
presented by Colonel Beaver of the Bank
of California; a magnificent revolver, pre
sented by General Wall, and another re
volver, presented by John Â£. Klein.
Two of the sections have already com
peted, und it is expected tliat the competi
tion will be closed in about two weeks,
when the hinlie-u nineteen scorers will
shoot for the prizes.
Saturday evening Sergeant Blank's sec
tion competed. There has always been a
keen rivalry between Policemen Cauipbeil
and Coogan in this section, and it was
conceded that either one or the other
wou.d be the lucky man. Coogan with
his first five shots made 21, one less than
the possible. He seemed to lose his nerve,

A Million Acres of Kich Soil to Be
Irrigated and Sold at SIO an
Acre.
John C. Beatty of Los Angeles, presi
dent of the Colorado Irrigation Company,
arrived at the Palace Hotel yesterday
with Mrs. Beatty. He will remain hero
several days on private business uncon
nected with the gigantic enterprise con
templated by his company in tne irriga
tion of an enormous area of arid but very
fertile land in the southeastern part of
California.
In September, 1894, just as all necessary
legislation had been granted to the com
pany by Congress, permitting them to tap
the Colorado River and to cut their pro
posed canal across an intervening Indian
reservation, discussion arose in the com
pany and some of the stockholders, to
gether with the former chief engineer,
began a suit in New York against tbe
president, virtually for tne control of the
enterprise. That suit at once put a stop
to all preparations for the actual work of
| construction, to be begun the following
month along the course of tbe big canal
I previously surveyed at an expense of
â  thousands of dollars.
The litigation nas been in progress ever
I since with a formidable array of attor
neys on both sides, the president of the
| company alone having no Jess than
I eighteen lawyers employed to offset an
' equal number at work for the opposition.
The case will come up for trial in New

York tin December 15, and it is expected
' willsobn alter be settled.
..The country to be irrigated by the enor
mous canal constitutes a great inland
sunken plain in the eastern part of San
Diego County. It is the property of the
irrigation company and includes .about
1,000,000 acres of lan.d much of which is
below the level of the sea. It is said to be
formed of the deepest and richest alluvial
deposits of any valley In the world, that
of the Nile not unexcepted, but is without
water.
In ages pnst it was the upper end o!
the Gulf of California, which is still reced
ing many feet annually. The Colorado
River, filled with surface washings fai up
its course, had, until some great eruption
cut off and caused the present desert,
emptied its rich sediment-bearing waters
into the oricinsil head of the gulf, until
now in some places the alluvial soil ex
tends down to the remarkable depth of
over ICO feet. What was at first, subse
quent to some geological change, an in
land sea became after rapid evaporation
of its fresh waters a sunken, waterless
plain, covered witn rich soil that to-day
produces unusual growths wherever irri
gation has been tried upon it.
The plan of the company is to snrround
this region by two main branches of
the canal running from the southeast to
the northward and also to the westward
of Salton Sea, one 125 miles In lengtli, the
other about 75 miles long, ana both sup
plied with numerous lesser branches, form
ing a network over the whole region. In
order that they might realize promptly on
the enormous investment or capital neces
sary to the expenses of building the canal
tl.e company would sell land, with water
rights included, at $10 an acre, and open
up the vrhole country to the culture of tne
sugar beet, for which it has been proved
particularly fitted, and for citrus and other
fruits.

AN ARTIST IN
SUNNY HAWAII
Hugo Fisher's Impressions
of the Beautiful
Islands.
Sketching Under Difficulties in
a Surf Canoe and in a
Wnirlw.nl
The Painter Was Enamored of the
Tropical Scenery in Which He
Worked for a Y.-ar.
Hugo Fisher, the well-fenown artist, has
returned from the Hawaiian islands,
where he spent a year sketching and
enjoying the dreamy life of the tropics.
While the temptation to take things' easy
was strong enough, Mr. Fisher never .for
got his work; but on the contrary, he
sketched and painted incessantly and
studied nature in her fairest and sunniest
moods, that are to oe seen or felt only in
Hawaii. Wherever there was any
! peculiarly interesting scene, or any char
acteristic bit of island landscape or bay,
â  lie visited that spot and recorded his im
pressiond in color sketches, so that Mr.
I Fisher returns with a bulging portfolio of
f beautiful subjects for pictures. And now
admirers of his work may lcok for tropical
pa:ntings from liis brush â a decided
change from the snow-dad Sierra pictures
which he liked so well to paint.
In more than oire place he had to. work
under ereat difficulties. Sketching in a
Kanaka canoe in the surf, and at another
place, where a man could not stand against
the whirlwind, caused him to imagine
that all was not dreamy in "the i*land of
dreams." However he found Hawaii a
better place for artists than San Francisco,
and he did not object to the risk of being
blown over a precipice or toppled out of a
canoe when making sketches for pictures
ordered by wealthy men in the islands.
"I bought back with me but one paint
ing," said Mr. Fisher. "Ail the rest I left
behind in Hawaii. I sold them. 11l had
twenty-five more painted I could have sold
them also."
In his studio at 319 Suiter street Mr.
Fisher is busy arranging his sketches and
painting pictures, as he intends to have
some of the most attractive island 'scenes
on exhibition at au early date. He likes
to go back over the paths he traveled in
the past twelve months and to tell now
Hawaiian scenery, people, climate- and
natural curiosities impressed him.
"Oh approaching Hawaii, the first feat
ure is Diamond Head, a bold, majestic
mountain," he began. "Cocoa Head
looms up next, and you find yourself near,
a tropical country with a background of
hish mountains all covered with verdure
and the most beautiful cloud effects I ever
saw. You pass Diamond Head and then
come in lull view of the celebrated Wai
kiki beach and Nuuanu Valley, beyond
Honolulu, a wonderiu! bacuground for the j
crty. Mount Tantalus looms up in the I
iar distance. Everything is green in the j
landscape â palm tree*, cocoanut trees in
the foreground and dense vivid verdure
beyond. The scene "is most enchanting,
the mountains veiled in a kiud of pur
plish, bluish haze with beautiful clouds
stretched aiong their tops, and a deep blue
sky over all. At vVnikiki beach the won
derful colors of the water are like the in
side of the abalone shell, opalescent and
constantly changing;. The beach is a
brok n line of gray sand bordered with
palms and cocoa tree's waving and nodding,
and beyond the scene is a mixture of blue]
purple and emerald. For life there are
the bathers and snrf- riders, who go
through the surf as fast as a locomotive.
"I had a novel experience in sketching
there. Mr. Peacock of Honolulu gave me
a commission to paint the beach. He
wanted a view from the sea, so I had logo
out in a native's little canoe and sketch in
a hiÂ«h sea. The natives were naked and
seemed quite at home, but I feared the
canoe would turn over. While I was
sketching oiip of the boatmen dived into
the water. He stayed down for a long
time and then camo' up with a sort of star
fish. With spikes like a porcupine. The
two men had a great feast and offered me
some of the star-fish, which tasted like an
oyster. W: en I world say go ashore the
boatmen would let the boat go on ton of a
big wave and we would shoot through the
surf at such a terrific rate it made my hair
stand on end, but 1 clung to the canoe and
landed safely each time.
"One of the most entrancina views is
that at Pali at the end of Nuuanu Valley,
about four miles from Honolulu, There
are great mountains to the right and left
ana through an opening you get one en
chanting view of a valley covered with
pusar plantations and bananas and in the
far distance a range of mountains and
still farther off the blue Pacific looking
like a painted sea. Pali is over 1400 feet
high. I painted a picture of the Pali,
which was bought by Mr. Peacock. At
the summit where I had to paint there is a
whirlwind blowing at the rate of fifty
miles an hour, sometimes more than that.
A native on horseback was blown over the
cliff. When I first went there my paints,
paper and traps were blown into the air
far above my head. Before I could get a
good sketch I had to go six or eight times
to Uie tame spoi. Even then I could use
only .n small bit of paper and had to take
in the scene on separate pieces in the face
lof tbe gale. Au easel was cut of the
question, and it was hard work to hold
tbÂ« paints down.
"On the trip- to the island of Hawaii I
was treated to a most magnificent sunset;
it was tropical and glorious. The ride to
the volcano, or mountain of fire, I found
to be one of the most interesting exposi
tions, thc'irnil passing through tut virgin
forest ar.d every turn in the road finding
a new scene. All about us were wild ba
nanas, palm trees, fern trees, creeping
plants â a picture of tropical glory, with
here and there a coffee plantation peep
inc through ttie forest, each vista a beau
tiful sight. Farther up the mountain the
flor;i takes on the character of the tem
perate zone, and at '.a t there is nothing
but lava. My party took no guide to the
crater. As we stood beside the cavern of
fire i felt the ground tremble and a sick
ening sensation came upon me. 'For
heaven's sake let us get. out of this,' I
said, and we walked back from the verge
ot the ciiff. One minute later the spot'
where we were standing crumbled away
and fell into the fire with a roar; one
minute later and had we remained there
would be no more artist.
"There is a strange bird that makes its
home at this volcano, the boatswain bird.
It has its young about the cliffs and flies
to the sea a distance of Iwenty or thirty
miles for fish to feed them.
"The coffee and sugar plantations make
pretty landscapes with a background ol
purple mountain", an intense blue sky
and some touches of bright green palms
and banana trees. The harborof Waienai,
m which are many of these nlantations,
reminds one of the bay of Naples, and is
certainly wortny of a visit by tourists."
The waterfalls of Hawaii, where a
hundred streams tumole down the moun
tains and eventually over a cliff into the
ocean, were seen and sketched by Mr.
Fisher; and also the famous rainbow falls,
where the prismatic arch dances eternally
in the sunshine. The natural bridge at
Onemca was not missed, for it appears in
the portfolio as a wall of purple rock
jutting into the sea and clad with tropical
shrubs. It has a picturesque appearance,
this bit of island coast scenery, thoueh the
colors to one who huÂ«' never seen Hawaii
are certainly startling.

DISCUSSED THE
LIQUOR PROBLEM
Rev. Dr. Dille Takes Up
the Subject at the Cen
tral Church.
Work of the American Ant;-
Saloon League as a Factor
ot Reform.
R.v. Dr. Adams' Address Up.n the
Evils of Modern Civilization and
Their Remedy.
At the Central Methodist Church yes
terday Dr. Elbert R. Dille discussed the
liquor problem, devoting particular atten
tion to the American Anti-Saloon League
as one oi the most important factors con
tributing to reform.
He traced the history of this institution
since the date oi its inception at Washing
ton, D, C., a little less than a year ago and
described the good work already accom
plished through its instrumentality. The
great object of this league is to federate
and unify the scattered forces of reform so
that they may present a united front to
the organized ranks of the liquor-dealers.
"The Anti-Saloon League," said the
speaker, "affords common standing
ground for all shades of political and re
ligious and temperance faith so long as
they are opposed to the saloon. It does
not ask a man whether he is for high
license or prohibition ; whether he is a
moderate diinker or a total abstainer; it
doe 3 not concern itself whether he takes a
glass of wine or a dass of bser nt his
meais; it says 'whatever your faith or
practice, if you believe that society and
the Slate would be better without the
saloon give us your hand.' "
"The Anti-baloon League takes the
saloon out of politics and deals with it
not as a political but a moral question.
The saloonkeeper has no politics but the
interests of his business. His voting
number is No. 1. When Jay Gould was
belore the Senate Committee on Railroads
they asked him his politics. He said, 'In
a Democratic county I am a Democrat, in
a Republican county a RepuDlican, in a
doubtiul county 1 am doubtiul; but
always and everywhere 1 am for the Erie
Railroad.' That is the way with the
saloon."
The league proposes to work for and
secure the passage of a law that shall put
the question of saloon suppression upon
the ballot at ever 3' election. To the ques
tion how has the league worked so iar,
Dr. Dille replied:
"It has united the temperance forces as
nothing else has ever done.
"In its great conventions Catholic and
Protestant Bishops and clerey, Republi
cans, Democrats and Prohibitionists have
sat tide by side. In ;his State every re
ligious body to whom it has so iar "been
presented has adopted it with hearty
unanimity, and so have all the temperance
organizations. Already a provisional
State committee has been formed, and it
is expected that a State convention will be
held in the near future. It has aroused
the enmity and alarm of the liquor power
as has no other movement of the century.
The Wine and Spirit News says 'the Anti-
Saloon LeaÂ«ue will capture the church and
the cnurch will capture the State, and then
God have mercy on us poor liquor men
wfio won't be allowed to live at all.' It has
won many victories in States North and
South."
The speaker then by a series of charts
illustrated its work. They showed that
40 per cent of the territory "of this Nation
has driven out the saloon. In Georgia 88
ou t of 137 counties have "gone dry" â that
is they have not a single saloon. In Ar
kansas at the recent election 44 counties
went dry to 31 wet, and the State gave a
majority against the saloon. In Ohio, 51
counties drj\ 36 wet; in Mississippi, 61
dry to 14 wet.
"But," he asked, "how can local option
reach our cities, rum-ruled as many of
them are? Well, about one-fourth of the
territory of this State is now without
saloons under the operation of local
option; when all the interior counties are
freed from the saloon and they are all con
verged in this City, then by local option
we will drive it into the downtown wards
and into the lowest streets. Then when we
have it isolated and segregated into one
cesspool of corruption whose stench and
fumes shall appear to rise frem hell itself,
the people educated a* they will be by
that time will, with the surcery of the
law, cut out this cancer â this malignant
ulcer upon our civilization."
BETTER THAN IT WAS.
In Speaking: of ''National Ills," Dr.
Adams Thought Excess In Liquor
Drlnklnjf Was Waning.
Dr. George C. Adams, the new pastor of
the First Qongregational Church, preached
a sermon to a large audience yesterday
morning. The subject was "National Ills,"
but the speaker dealt more with the
.methods of curing national evils than with
the enumeration of them.
He taKes a hopeiul view of the situation,
and would have the pessimist Ircep silent
and go to work.
He took his text from Isaiah, xi, 10
and 5 11, and explained that the isles of
Kedar and Kittim, mentioned by the
prophets, were the farthest west and
the farthest east known to the Israelites
at that time. Isaiah asks if they can find
a nation o: the heathen who had changed
then goda. And yet Israel, who had the
living and true God, was turning away
from him. This turning away from God
was the root of national ills, and no
remedy will be efficacious which does not
reach down to the starting point of a
country's misfortunes.
The doctor quoied the saying of Aristo
tle that "'mail it by nature a political
animal," and said perhaps this was the
reason people look for a political curj for
every ill. This, he think-, is a mistaken
expectation. It is not by party vote tbat
great reforms are likely to be bi ought
about. He elaborated this thought and
mentioned the many parties which had
made futile attempts to carry needed re
forms. But nevertheless he believed that
attention to politics is a necessary part of
practical Christianity. No man has a
moral right to shirk this civic duty. He
knew of some men who would pray fer
vently for the country, but would not go
to the polls ana vote.
The second t ought Dr. Adams sought
to impress upon his hearers was that men
must not become pessimistic because of
the new problems which are now pressing
for solution. We dwell in a transition
period and evils seem fearful mainly be
cause they are new.
We are facing the mo<t tremendous
problems of any age. Tnere is no great
danger that we cannot solve them.
Speaking of the modern l.ouor traffic
being such a bugbear to many "people Dr.
Adams claimed that in the matter of
liqnor drinking the world is not nearly so
bad as it was in the time of our fathers.
In New England a hundred years ago at
every conference of ministers they bad
New England rum to regale them.
In those old days pious men used to
sell Bibles and keep liquor and hops at the
same time. In 1835 an advertisement ap
peared in a Salem paper, signed "Enquire
at Deacon Giles' Distillery." ThÂ« Rev.
G. B. Cheever published a pamphlet satir
izing the" idea of deacanap having distil
leries. He was convicted of libel and im
prisoned 30 days. We are distinctly in
advance of that: estimate of liquor mak
ing. ' o
As to remedy for national ills, the pas
tor said: "Social reform can only be made
by work on individual, souls. Uselessnesa
rather than poverty is the chief evil of
human life. Work needed" to-day is not
that of a party, but the deepening of
respect for law." Enthrone God cm the in
dividual heart and the Nation will be
safe."

THE HOLIDAY TEADE.
There can be no doubt that the spirit oi
confidence in returning prosperity which
followed the election eof McKinley will
show itself to a marked decree in the holi
day trade of all parts- oi the United
States. We may look forward, therefore,
to livelier and better business this season
than we have known lor several years
past.
When workinpmen are employed they
make good trade for merchants of all de
scriptions. In the aggregate the trade of
what is known as tue working class is
worth more to every ce/umunity than the
trade of millionaires. When labor is fully
employed and well paid a general pros
perity infuses iueif into evwy line of
business, and there are profits lor all.
Jt is true that we cannot expect a res
toration to a degree of prosperity equal to
that of 1892 all at once. Nevertheless we
have made a good beginning. Mills and
factories have opened up in all pans of
the country, and hundreds of thousands
of meu are now receiving good waaes and
have the prospect before them of steady
employment who at this time last year
were either out of work or were living in
fear oi losing their jobs.
In California we have additional rea
sons for expecting a lively holiday trade.
Not only has the election assured us of a
speedy return to a system of protection,
but ail our rural industries have had a
season of more than ordinary prosperity.
Crops have been fairly large, prices have
an upward tendency, and, while it is true
the greater portion of the grain crop was
out of the hands of farmers before the
rise came, even in this case there has been
a considerable gain to the producer over
the conditions of last year.
The growers of fruits, nuts, grapes,
raisins and the producers of wine are con
siderably better off than in late years.
While in several of these industries the
output was not so large as it would have
been had the spriug season been more fa
vorable, the losa in quantity was largely
made up by the increased price, and, as a
whole, the income to the State from these
industries will be satisfactory. The out
look for the oraDge crop is exceptionally
good, both as regards the quantity of the
crop and the price, so that in the orange
growing districts the era of prosperity
may be said to have begun.
All of these things will tend to increase
the trade of the holidays and to put
money into circulation. With improved
trade there wiil come mor<j cheerful and
sanguine feeling among merchants, and
this, in turu, will lead to enlarged orders
from manufacturers. The trade of the
cominÂ» month, therefore, is likely to
prove beneficial in more ways than one.
It will give a stimulus !o industry and en
terprise, and help on the coming of better
times for all.
PROGRESSIVE MERCHANTS,
The activity of merchants on some of
the leading thoroughfares, of the City
gives promise of a vast improvement in
our streets as regards both lighting and
paving. Progressive men have succeeded
in arousing their neighbors to the impor
tance of improving the streets on which
they do business in order that the busi
ness itself may be improved, and such is
the ardor with which the new movement
has been undertaken that there is good
reason for believing we shall see impor-'
tant results- attained- in this work in all
quarters of the City.
The success achieved by the business
men. aud property-owners in advancing
the trade of several streets by improved
lighting has not been lost upon the mer
chants and property - owners 1 of other
localities. What has been effected in one
place can undoubtedly be effected in
others by the same means, and as a con
sequence the new plan has been taken r.p
elsewhere and is being vigorously pushed
forward.
There can be no question bnt that a
large number of the principal thorough
fares of the City are in great need of im-.
provement. The condition of our streets
is in fact one of the greatest defects of our
municipal iife. We hay* hardly a good
street in the City. Scarcely a sinele thor
oughfare of business is either paved or
lighted in a way to make it comfortable
to residents or attractive to visitors. Any
movement, therefore, which tends to im
provement in these respects is one which
deserves the commendation of popular
opinion and the support of public spirit.
San Francisco will not fail to cive due
credit to her progressive merchants and
property-owners who are now doing co
much to advance the streets in which
they are interested. They Have set an
example which sooner or later will be fol
lowed even by men who up to this time
have hesitated to spend a dollar for the
improvement of their property. More
over, the influence of the example set in
this way will have its effect upon the mu
nicipal government and the people at
large, so that within the near future we
may look to see a new era in street work
begun which will result in providing San
Francisco with streets and highways com
mensurate with her position among the
cities of the United States.
THE DAIRY .INDUSTRY.
During the coming week there is to be
held in Ban L<u!s Obispo an institute for
the consideration of the industries of
farming and dairying, which lias attracted
considerable attention from the people of
that section and promises to be of no little
benefit to them.
From the proeramme arranged for the
meeting, as published by the San Luis
Obispo Breeze, it seems the principal in
terest in the institute will be that of dairy
ing. The chief papers to be read at the
meeting will deal with some phase of that
industry and are to be read by men who
are thoroughly competent to deal with-it.
There can be no question of the impor
tance of developing this industry to a
much greater extent than it has at present
in California. The report of the State
Dairy Bureau, just issued, says there has
been imported into our market from the
East for the year ending October 1, 1896,
608,200 poundÃof butter, and during the
same time 639,840 pounds of cheese. It is
certainly strange that in a State so well
adapted to the dairy industry as ours,
such a large importation of dairy products
should be needed to supply the demauds
of the people.
Even in its present condition, however,"
California dairying is a considerable
source of wealth, and occupies an im
portant position amon? the industries of'
the State. The Dairy Bureau reports that
the value of the products of our dairies for
the year ending October 1 was in the ag
gregate $12,331,000. The industry is car
ried on mainly in the counties of Marin,
Humboidt, San Luia Obispo, Sonoma,
Monterey, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, San
Mateoand Los Angeles, the* three last
named counties being the largest manu
facturers of cheese.
It is noted in the report of the State
Bureau that the operation of the law
against the sale of oleomargarine and
bulterine as butter has proven very ef
fective in promotine the welfare of the
industry. In a period ol fourteen months
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 30. 1896.
before the new law went into effect
over 450,000 pounds of oleomargarine and
butterine were sold in the State, entailing
a loss to the d.airy industry of about
?100,000. The benefits of the law have so
much encouraged the dairymen that they
propose to ask for further legislation in
the same direction. The industry there
fore seems to be in a fair way of improve
ment, and, no doubt, the coming institute
at San Luis Obispo will do much to pro
mote it in many ways.
CALIFORNIA MINES.
The Redding Free Press gives a carefully
considered review of the mining outlook
for Shasta County, which in its main lines
will apply equally well to almost all the
Â«nining districts of the State. It not only
shows the brightening prospects of the
miners, but gives the reasons why the
new prosperity is coming.
After referring to some mines in Shasta,
which heretofore have been considered of
small value, it goes on to say:
These same properties are now being worked
to a profit, simply because the work is being
done on business lines and es legitimate busi
ness enterprises. New and improved ma
chinery aud methods are being employed,
and success is. now the rule where formerly
failure and financial disaster were the com
mon results of mismanagement and wildcat
specu:atiou. The sensible business methods
adopted and the solid work done in explora
tion have fully demonstrated the permanency
and great extent of our mineral deposits.
The same reasons which are bringing
the mines of Shasta to the favorable con
sideration of capitalists are operating
throughout all the mining counties of
California. The new era in mining is to
be an era of legitimate business aided and
aumnented by improved processes, better
machinery and larger capital. These
forces working together cannot fail to
produce great results, and not in Shasta
only, but throughout the State, can there
be found many mines which were form
erly considered of small value, but are
now either yielding good profits to the
workers or else revealing evidences of ore
which will largely repay the capitalists
who furnish the machinery and the skill
to develop them.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Sir William Armstrong's company at Els
wick obtained a contract October 17, through
their resident agent in China, J. J. Bucheister,
for the building of two cruisers for the Chi
nese navy.
The total number of torpedo-boat destroyers
In the British navy built, building or ordered
is ninety and it is expected that orders lor ten
more, of five knots greater speed ihr.n the
fastest yet built, will be ordered given the
end of the fiscal year, making 100 altogether.
Sir Edward Reed, ex-chief constructor of the
British navy, has been engaged by the Chilean
Government to superintend the construction
of a battle-ship of 8500 tons and a cruiser of
4500 tons, the latter to -have a speed of twenty
three knots. Both vessels are being built at
Elswick.
Drydock 15 In the Pembroke dockyard has
been practically completed and water.let into
it. In ease of emergency the dock is ready for
'use, but as no ship is likely to want it the work
of finishing will not be hurried. England is
steadily adding to her docking facilities in the
dockyards, a policy which has been partly
followed" in this country, with this notable
difference, that docks have been built here
where there are no repairing facilities and
where vessels can only enter when the mooÂ«
is full.
There is considerable activity in navy build
ing in Russia. An 8800-ton battle-ship of the
Rotislaw type is to be laid down at Nikolaieff.
The gun vessel Uilyab of 900 tons will be
launched during this month from the .new
Admiralty yard to make room for the Pa 11 ad a,
a cruiser of the British Diana type, to be built.
At the Baltic yard an enlarged Russia oi
14,000 tons hns teen begun* aud several tor
pÂ«do-boats are under construction. Tne bat
tle-ship; Oslabga and Peresriet are to be
launched next spring. At St. Petersburg a
coast defence armorclad of the General Ad
miral type is also to be laid down.
The Loire, a French steam transport of 1200
'tons built in 1855, and for many years laid
up at Saigon as a hulk, was recently sold to
ship-breakers. Lee Sing Yee, a Hongkong
Chinese, bought her for $9025 and will tow
her to Hongkong. This will cost $4000. but
still the purchase is a very profitable oue, as
the copper in her hull is worth over $12,000,
her oak frames and planking may bring
$12,000 and the fittings $0000. Old-time
snips of the navy oi merchant service' are
vastly more valuable than metal chips of the
past twen.y years, the material of which all
goes in the scrap heap and brines but a beg
garly amount after a heavy expense in break
ing up the ship. #
The armored cruiser Carlo Alberto, a sister
ship to the Veita Pizani, was launched at
Spezzia on September 23 in the presence of. the
King of Italy. The *hip is of CSOO tons dis
placementâ about 2000" smaller than our New
Yorkâ but much has been i.cco'mplished on
this small displacement, She has an all
around belt with additional plating in wake
of the battery, the- maximum thickness of
steel being 6 inches. Tne battery is case
mated; the' guns are separated by bulkheads,
protected overhead by. 2-inch steel, and the
armored deck underneath is 1.4 inches in
thickness. The main battery consists of
twelve 5.9-inch quick rirers.of whloh eight are
on broadside aud four in the corners of the
casemate. She carries also six 4.7-inch, ten
2.2-iucn, eight 1.4-incU quick -firers and has
five torpedo-tubes. The machinery is triple
expansion, calculated to develop 13,000
horsepower and give a speed of twenty knots.
The coal supply will bj 1000 tons aud the ship
will also have arrangements for carrying
liquid fuel. Her complement will number
4J30 officers and men. The New York of the
United States navy displaces with 1300 tons
oi coal on board about 8740 tpns, at which
her sea speed may reach 2J knots. Her belt, 4
inches thick, extends along amidships for
about 160 feet, but there is uo further protec
tion to h r battery than of the six 8-inch
rifles in turrets, while the twelve 4-inch rapid
flrers have only the usual shield protection.
Her secondary battery consists oi eight
6-pounders, four 1-pounders and four gat
lings. The New York is capable of attacking
armorclads with mouerate protection, but the
Carlo Alberto is more competent to deal with
cruisers.

REVIVAL OF BUSINESS
Dun's I'.eilew
The pain in volume of business continues
entirely without precedent. More than 390
establishments have started work since the
election which were idle, and at least 300
have Increased working force, making 030
concerns which are known to have added
largely to the number of hands at work, and
these are only part o,f the" whole number.
Every day thus *ilds thousands to the number
of those who are able 10 t. uy a week's supplies
and to make up gradually lor many months of
enforced economy. Already this brings great
increase in the volume of business, and the
clearing-house exchange*, for the first time in
several years, not only exceed those of last
year by 10 per cent, but al-o exceed those of
the same week in 1B!>2 by 0 per cent. Busi
ness men are all anxious to prevent anythin g
like the fictitious exci:onient of la"st summer,
ami In nearly all branches an excessive rise in
prices is prevented. But with more hands at
work there is inevitably a greater demand for
supplies, materials and products.

STORY OF THE ELECTION.
Comparison Btwn the States ; Which
toted for llt.Kiuley and for Bryan.
'" Providence Journal. :
Here Is the story of the election as figures
from the last United States census tell it. In
round numbers twenty-five States with a popu
lation of 45.500,000 voted -for JlcKinley, and
twenty States with a population of 25,000,000
voted for Bryan. In other words, almost two
thirds of the population are in States that
repudiate iree silver. The total industrial
wealth of those twenty-five McKinley States is
$47,384,717,970, while The twenty Bryan
States have but $16,650,354,934, or about one
third as much, an average of ?834,010,.249 to
theMcKinley States' average of $1,893,388,
-719, more than twice as much.
But when educational statistics are taken,
then is the contest best shown, perhaps. Just
22 per cent of the silver States' population is
illiterate (unable to read or write), wliiiebut
7.5 per cent of the sound-money States' popu
lation is thus deficient. Briefly, there are
three times as many illiterates in the silver
States as in sound-money States. Figured out,
though the McKinley States are nearly twice
as populous, they contain but 3,406, 9 I.lit
erates to 5, 215 in the Bryan Slates. One
or two 01 the ilcKinley States may yet be
transferred 10 the Bryan column. Ii so, it
would only serve to make the contrast greater.

A NEW SACRED EDIFICE.
St. I'aul's Protestant Episcopal Church
Was Dedicated by Bishop Nichols
Yesterday.
The nandsome new St. Paul's Protestant
Episcopal church, at the corner ot Cali
fornia and Fillmore streets, was dedicated
yesterday by the Right Reverend Bishop
Nichols.
The building, which is an imposing
structure of English Gothic architecture,
stands on the site of the old wooden
church, which' was removed to make way
lot a more commodious place of worship.
It was commenced just 120 days ago, and
hurried forward to completion that it
might be dedicated on the first Sunday in
Advent, the beginuing of* the new year in
the Protestant Episcopal church.
The Bishop in the dedicatory services
was assisted by the Rev. W. M. Rielly,
the Rector of St. Paul's, Rev. R. C. Foute
of Grace Episcopal Church, Rev. W. H.
Morelami oi St. Luke's, Rev. J. A. Emery
of the Church of the Advent, Rev. Hoburt
Chetwood of St. James' Mission, Rev. W,
I. Kip of the chapel of the Good Samari
tan and Rev. Mr. Mynard.
The music was rendered by a full sur
pliced choir of young gentlemen and
ladies, the latter in white gowns and
black mortar-boards, and a qdartet, con
sisting of: Miss Mabel Love, soprano;
Mrs. Homer Henley, contralto; J. Des
mond, tenor, and Harry Melvin, basso.
The entire force of twenty-four voices was
under the direction of Professor F. Katzen
bach, the orcanist. An offertory solo was
grandly sunÂ» by Homer Henley. The
beautiful anthem, "I Waited for the
Lord," was rendered by Mrs. Homer Hen
ley and Miss Mabel Love.
During the services addresses were made
by iÃishop Nichols and Rev. Mr. Foute,
in which they spoke of the difficulties
that D^set the builders of the splendid
edifice at the beginning of their labors.
But so energetic and rapid had been their
work that only 120 days elapsed while the
structure was buiit from foundation to
steeple.
The building cost $15,000, of which $5000
has not been raised. The friends of the
church have been liberal in their dona
tions, and the present indebtedness will
doubtless soon be cleared off.
.â  The heating apparatus was provided
gratuitously by J. B. Sietson and the elec-
I triclignt system by John I. Sabin. The
church will be consecrated when free of
debt.
Throughout the interior the woodwork
is of solid oak. The main front of the
building is in light red sandstone with a
handsome tin kali.
ST. ANDREW'S DAY.
I.ei-oM* lininn by R-, v . Dr. Spalding
From the Life of the Saint. ,
Yesterday being St. Andrew's day the
Rev. Dr. Spaiding ot St. John's Episcopal
Church took for his text the words of the
Lord, "What seek ye?" spoken to that
apostle when, with a fellow-disciple, he
first sought him.
He first pave an outline of St. Andrew's
life, of how he was converted by the
teaching of St. John the Baptist and im
mediately sought the Lord and, having
found him, was not satisfied until he
brought his brother to him a;so.
From this life Dr. fcpaldingdrew several
beautiful lessons, lirst that o? repent
ance â bow every one must -eeek the
Savior through tiie experience of reient
ance, which does not mean simply beinir
sorry for wrongs done, but also a ttii-rough
giving-up of self and living lives 1 tor
Ofarist. The next lesson was that of the
utter unselfishness ot St. Andiew'sjife.
He did not a?k for position or wealth.
He slmpiy wanted Jesus, and when he
found him he wanted to work for him a::d
wanted others to share in the happiness
which he foi.nd in that work. His death,
as his life, teaches the beautiful lesion of
uuaelnshuesa.
A MINING BUREAU
FOR THE PARK
A Proposition to Have It
Maintained Where Peo
ple Can See It.
A Test to b9 Made With a
Vapor Lamp ior Park
Illumination.
The Park Force of Laborers to be
Reduced by Forty To-dayâ Attrac-
tions at B.ach ani Chutes.
Parties who desire to advertise the in
dustry to the fullest will at the next ses
sion of the Legislature endeavor to have
that body pass an act authorizing the ap
propriation of a sum sufficient to estao.
lidh the State Mining Bureau in Golden
Gate Park, and if possible to enlarge its
scope. It is also proposed to have located
within the same grounds an institution
to be maintained at the expense of the
State in which shall be exhibited pro
ducts from all parts of California, in
onler to show its resources, something
after the exhibit" of the State Board of
Trade, and make it also a bureau of-in
formation.
President Austin of the Park Commis
sion, when asked if the commissioners
had any knowledge of these propositions,
said :
"I am of the opinion that they would
be extremely useful exhibits and if they
could be seen by thousands oi people -who
visit the park they would prove the great
est kind of an advertisement for the State.
Everybody in the City and every stranger,
whether from the interior of the State or
from abroad, comes out here, and they
would be great attractions which they
would not miss seeing.
"If the State will authorize such exÂ«
bibits in the park we will give all the
room required. Where could they be es
tablished ? Well, they will be put up near
the museum. The three, in close prox
imity to one another, would form interest
{ in c educational exhibits.''
To-day between forty and fifty of ibÂ«
laborers in Golden Gate Park will" be cHs
rais s ed. The reason for this," said Su
perintendent McLaren, "is that nearly all
the work that was laid out has been al
most liinsheu, and what remains to be
done can be accomplished with a much
smaller force than we have had. At this
season, for instance, there is no need for
men to water the grounds."
On the subject of lights with which to
illuminate the park Superintendent Mc-
Laren stated he had received some re
plies to his questions sent to park officials
in the East, prom these it appears that
in St. Louis the parks are not lighted all
night; in New York arc lignts and vapor
lights are used; in Fairmount Park, Phila
delphia, gas is the illuminator; in Cleve
land, Ohio, vapor lights are used, and
Chicago, which has been using electricity,
is substituting tbe vapor lights.
One of the lamps, such as are used in
Cleveland, has been received by the Com
missioners, who will put it in operation
to compare it with an arc light. It is very
similar to the lamps used by the gas com
pany of this City, but in one corner there
is a small tank which contains a special
liquid that runs into an arrangement at
the bottom of tho lamp, where it is con
verted into an inflammable gas, said to be
equal in illuminating power to electricity,
and but one-third the cost.
Ttie grading of the grand court has been
completed except at the southern end,
where the bandstand will be located. The
contract for the stand wili not be let this
winter.
Reuben H. Lloyd has donated to the
park museum two pieces of tappa from
the South Sea islands. Tappa was the
substitute of the ancient natives for blan
kets and is extremely rare, as none is made
now.
The most attractive feature presented to
the audience in the Stitro Baths yesterday
was the swim of J. C. Saxton under the
surface, he swam from one end of the
long tank to within a iew feet of the other
end, breaking the world's record of 248
feet.
Arrangements are nearly completed for
the international tug-of-war, which will
commence December 13 and close Decem
ber 20. There will be twelve teams, repre
senting America, Ireland, Scotland, Ger
many, Norway. Sweden, Denmark, Italy,
England, Canada, Blavonia and Portugal.
The Chutes were crowded all the after
noon, and toward evening C. W. Vosiner
made a very tine ascent with his balloon
rising higher than any aeronaut who ever
left the grounds. After remaining up nine
minute? he cut loose and came down with
his parachute near Lacuna Honda, the
time of his descent being three minutes
and a half. Ujually the moment a para
chute is cut loose the balloon turns, col
lapses and reaches the ground before the
aeronaut, out yesterday the sphere re
mained stationary for four minutes after
Vosmer cut away before it turned.
An exciting event at the grounds was a
potato race for boys with toy wheelbar
rows. TherÂ« were six entries and three
prizes, $3. $2 and $1. The winners in
onler were: George Simmons, Ed White
and Joe S rnraons.

SHIPS FOR HAWAII
BEING BUILT HERE
The Manna Loa Will Sail
fcr Honolulu To-
Day.
She Will Take Pack a Number
oi Kanakas Who Are
Stranded
They Shipped as Wha ers cni Werj
Paid Off at the End cf the Trip
With a Dollar.
Hawaii is sending considerable work to
California shipDuiluers. The Inter-Island
Steam Navigation Company is replacing
nearly all its steamers and the Hails were
selected to do the woric. Every vessel
turned out by the firm has proved a &uc
cess, and in consequence the representa
tives of the Hawaiian firm were not sur-
Drised when the Mauna Loa exceeded
expectations on her trial trip.
The new steamer is now lying at Pacific
street wharf, and will probably sail for
Honolulu this afternoon. A picture of
the vessel ano her description have al
ready been civen in The Call. Captain
Godfrey, the superintendent of the Inter-
Island Navigation Company, and his
family, will go down on the vessel. Cap
tain Fitzgerald, however, will be in com
mand. Captain H. Johnson will be chief
cilice r and A. Bromley will be chief engi
neer. C. Keacti. the supervising engineer
of the company, will remain In San Fran
cisco to look after anotiier steamer that is
now having her engines put in by the
Fulton iron Works. Both vessels were
built by Hall Bros., and they are a credit
to San Francisco.
The Mauna Loa's steerage will be well
filled. Whalers tnat leave here in the
winter make for the Southern seas short
handed. When they reach Honolulu they
ship a Kanaka crew for a cruise to tne
Arctic. When the vessel got back last
month almost all bands were paid off
with fl. The catch was a poor one and
all and sundry had to suffer. Tne Ha
waiian? were in a predicament and they
appealed to the Consul. The latter has
been paying their expenses for several
weeks, and now he has secured a passage
for them to Honolulu on the Mauna Loa.
Each man has been an outfit and
will be taken better care of than when he
was in the Arctic. Outride of the United
Kingdom there is no country on earth
that taKes be.ter care of its citizens than
the Hawaiian republic.
The whalers who are to leturn on the
Mauna Loa look with envj r on the whale
bone brought up from Honolulu by the
Australia. There is nearly $10,000 worth
of the stuff, and the vessels that put it
ashore will continue the cruise in the
South seas. The chances ere that some
of the men who are now being sent home
by the Consul will risk another cruise in
the Arctic, but on tbe next occasion their
ship may take eiuht or ten whales and
then their "lay" will amount to enough
to keep them for several years in their
island home.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Pomona sailed for Eureka yesterday.
Among the passengers were J. Campbell,
tue well-known attorney. He has to ap
pear in a suit against the railroad com
pany in the Superior Court of Humboldt
County to-morrow, so in that event ha de
cided to travel by water. Chief Steward
Curtis of the Umuti.ia also went out in
command of his own particular depart
ment on the Pomona. Chief Sieward
Seeley has transferred his allegiance to
the Oceanic Steamship Company, so the
Pomona was left without one of her heads
of departments. A3 the I' mat ilia was laid
up for repairs and Chief Curtis had prac
tically nothing to do the company sent
him out on the Eureka boet.
The only place on the water front yes
terday that presented a busy appearance
was at Howard 3. There a aouble gang of
men were at woric trying to get tne coal
out ot the Truckee. It is from the Beaver
Hill mine ard latterly the steamers have
been unable to bring the coal quick
enough to supply the demand. When the
Czarina is put on the run next month the
chances are that the supply will be equal
tothe demand.
The tug Hunter arrived here a few days
ago from Coos Bay. She wants a bor

the steel tugs oi the Spreckel* fleet.
The San Francisco Laundry's gasoline
launch was carrying passengers to the
Jiennington yesterday, but did not do
much business. As no passengers could
be secured at Clay street the boat was
moved around to the footol Folsom street.
When the captain attempted io tie up at
the slip the boatmen objected and a iree
light ensued. Finally the laundry boat
was driven away and went back to Clay
street. It was too cold for travel, and in
consequence none of the excursion boats
did any business.
The whaleback Progressist is now load
ing wheat at Port Costa. She came here
in June, 1895, and ever since has been car
rying co:tl from Nanaimo for Dunsmuir &
Co. The contract expired a few weeks
ago. Beiore loading at Britis . Columbia
the 1000 tons of ballast that was put in her
was taken out, and she brought down an
extra 1000 tons of coal. When all the
cargo was taken out the owners decided to
buy wheat and load the ship.

South Wales, but since the Linlithgow

Norton says there is no doubt but what
the Progressist will reach her destination
without any trouble, and has money to
wager that the whaieback will make
nearly as time as the M dl boat?.

IS MINISTER TO JAPAN.
K.W. Irwin, Hawaii's" Representative
for Seventeen Yean, Here on His
Way Unit.
R. W. Irwin, Hawaiian Minister to
Japan now and continuously since 1879,
arrived at the Palace yesterday from
Japan on his way 'East. He says the
American influence is pre-eminent in
Korea as applied to all other foreign pow
ers. As for San Francisco, he believes that
this City is destined always to be tbe great
entrepot of the American Pacific Coast,
and never Seattle or San Diego. Fast
steamers of large capacity, similar to
those on the Atlantic, should he thinks be
built and put upon the Pacific trade in
order to build up international commerce
on this coast.
His idea is that the terminus of the
Russian Trans-Siberia Railway will bo a
port on the Yang-tse River, which is
easily navigabie for seme distance from
its mouth. From Peking to the Yang
tse River the railway will probably be
controlled by the English, and possibly in
connection with the Germans; but from
the Mongolian frontier to Peking the rail
way will be run by Russian and French
capital. This road completes through
communication from Europe to the Pa
cific. It is will be completed, he thinks,
in from three to five years, provided tbe
tariff question be settled.
The Chinese idea is to apuble the duties
in order to give security for the construc
tion of the railway.
Japan is quiet. The soldiers and sailors
have taken the ending of the war as quiet
ly and philosophically as did the Ameri
cans of the Civil War and nave resumed
their former vocations. Japan's aiubi-J
tion and the feeling among her people is,
he declares, to develop in a material and
industrial way without external ambition
of any kind whatever.
Mr. Irwin will return to his post and
his family next May. It is bis sister who
is the dean of Radcliff Hall, tbe woman's
annex to Harvard University, where over
600 women are students. Mr. Irwin will
visit hrs sister while in the E.vt.
FIRE ON JACKSON STREET.
A Defective Flue Caused Damage to J.
C. Wilson's Houic.
A defective flue caused an early morn
ing fire in the residence of J. C.Wilson, on
Jarkson street, between Lacuna and Bu
chanan, yesterday morning, at 5:30
o'clock.
The department promptly responded
and succeeded in subduing* the flames,
not however until considerable damage
was done to the furniture and cartvts.
T c loss is estimated at between $2;30u and
$3000 of damage.
The Bu*h-Street Theater.
At the Bush-street Theater Kennedy, the
hypnotist and laugh-maker, will hold another

performances make the people smile.
W. S. HOBART'S PONY, TADPOLE.
This stunted scion of aristocratic equine stock is but ten bands high, or about to a

He was imported last week from New York &t a novelty, and his owner, who is proud
of Tadpole, has entered him in ail the jumping events in the comin: horse show.
Though little he will surprise many of the swell hurdle-jumpt?rs, and at the same time,
by h:s funny antics, add much to the amusement of the spectators. Tadpole'ia of

FITZ IS THROUGH
WITH HARD WORK
The Cornishman Looks Fit
to Fight to a
Finish.
He Hopes Sharkey Is So That
There Can Be No Com
plaints Made.
The Sailor Rested Yesterday, but
Will Work To-Day and
TcMorrow.
Long-legged, loose-jointed Bob Fitzsim
mons, who on Wednesday evening will
use his utmost endeavors to punch Sailor
Sbarkey into insensibility before the ex
piration of ten rounds, finished hia hard
training yesterday.
The final preparation consisted of the
usual spin along the roads, the bout with
the ba.' and the rattling rounds with his
sparring trainers, who were liurder worked
than on any day since the training of the
lanky Australian began.
After the windup with his hired men
Bob drew a satisfied breath, stretched his
sinewy arms to their fullest extent and
said:
"There, I guess that will do."
He looked fit to light a finish battle with
a longdistance man instead of the ten
rounds which many think will never be
completed. The stooping shoulders are
not so manifestly muscular as those "f
the sailor, Oat the sinews play beauflfuliy
beneath the skin and there are just enough
lines in the ruddy face to suit the judges
of r>rize-ring Mesh.
Munv of these visited Sausalito durinz
the day to ize up the Cornithnian with a
view to betting* their money on the right
end, but few saw ihe lengthy one.
knew the crowds would come and hied
himself to his cottase, where admittance
was denied to all but a favored few. Bob
said he felt fii and had no misgivings in
regard to the outcome of Wednesday
nijrlit's battle.
"They tell me Sharkey is in fine con
dition," he said, ''and I hope he is, for in
thut case neither of us will have any cause
to complain, no matter who goes down."
Those who could not get into the cottage
wandered down to the boathon^e where
Manager Julian was lounging about and
many asked for a look at the famous
punch ing-bag. Julian, with character
istic incivility, answered that it was
locked up and that any one who wanted
to do so could peek through the window.
Durinc the aiternoon, after calling the
nurse who attends to Bob Jr. and telling
her to take the little fellow into the house
out of the cold. Fitzsimmons sauntered
downtown, wearing sweater, cap and house
slippers, with a couple of friends and
escorted them to tho ferry.
Clad in everyday costume he looked far
from formidable except for the massive |
shoulders that showed through the loo>-e
coat, a suggestion of ihe tremendous
driving power that has won him most of
his battles.
Only light exercise will be taken dur- I
ing the time that elapses bsfore the light j
and Fitz- immons expects io gain five to
ten ponmis in the meantime, going into
the ring at about 172 pounds.
Tom SiiarKev remained around his j
headquarters all day yesterday, the only j
exercise he took being short walks at slow- I
measure pace on the boulevard that faces j
the ocean, and using his jaws very freely
answering the hundreds who approached
with words of encouragement. "If Tom
Sbarkey works his arms and fists as effect
ively on Wednesday night as he worked
his jaws to-day he'll make short work of
big Bob" was the remark of a bystander j
of tbe pugilistic stripe yesterday, who |
added, "I've been waiting for an hour to
have a word with him, and all that time
he's been doing nothing but chinning."
Notwithstanding the ordeal he had to
undergo, he looked fresh and chipper late
in the afternoon. As usual, he did not I
train yesterday because it was Sunday,
but to dny he will entiaaein some exercise,
just to ke*p himself in condition, and pos- ]
sibly to-morrow he may do a little work, j
but the whole of Wednesday he will re- j
main quiet and nurse bis strength for the '
event in the evening.
Though the big betting on the coming
contest will not begin until to-night, a
number of wageri were laid last evening
by sports who had been at the training
quarters of the men during the day and
had become enthusiastic over their looks.
One wager of $200 to $175 was made that i
Sbarkey would stay ten rounds and an- j
other of $100 to $90 on the same proposi
tion.
On the question of rounds the bettine
ran $50 to* $40 that Fitzsimmons would!
last eight rounds and $20 to $10 that he
would last six.
Â£harkey and Fitzsimmons were exam
ined by a physician yesterday, and the
following report was sent to the National
Athletic Club:
Gentlemen: In compliance with your instruc
tions, 1 have ;his day made a thorougn exami
nation oi the pliyxical conditon of Kobert
Kitr.simmons and Thomas Sharkey. I find
both men to be in tbe pink of condition and
competent to undergo any test of physical en
durance without harmful results. Respect
fully yours, . Dr. D. D. Lvstig.
A measurement of both men's cbests
showed th.Â°.t SharkeyN chest when ex
panded exceeded Fitzsimmons' by half
an inch. Fitz^immons was, normal, 39,
expanded. 44. and Sharkey, normal, 41,
expanded, 44)2.
Mr. Gibbs, manager of the National
AthJetic Club, when seen last evanine,
spoke of his visit to the men's training
quarters. He said:
"I went over to see Fitzsimmons at Sau
sahto vi-sterday, and I asked him how he
felt. He replied: 'I k-el confident of
knocking thut tellow out in two rounds,
and it I aon't 1 will never enter the ring
again.'
"Sharkey also expressed his determina
tion of knocking 'that fellow' out In five
rounds, or he 'would not right again.' "
A dispute arose over the gloves to be
used on th- night of the h\'ht. Fitzsim
mons wanted to use a pair of gloves made
for him in the East. The gloves were
shown to Sharkey and hs objected to their
use. When Fitzsimmons was informed of
Sharkey's refusal, he immediately said he
would no' fight.
Julian then said that snch a
small matter as that should not
be an obstacle, and he notified Sbarkey
that he would get a set of gioves made
here and the gloves could be thrown in
the middle of the ring and after Sharkev
had taken his pick Fitzsimmons would
take what was left.
Preparations '"ill begin to-morrow at
the Pavilion. Seats will be arranged for
10,000. So f;ir a large sale l.as been made ;
it already exceeds the number sold for the
Corbett ligiit.

CANNED MILK
CARRIED DEATH
Little Ethel Kane a Vic
tim of Poisoned
Food.
Partook of Her Evening Meal
and Died in a Few
Hours.
H<t Father and 0 der Sister Also Vio
lently 11] From the Focd but
Recover.
Ethel Kane, a pretty baby girl five years
of age, daughter of John Kane, who is
employed in Nolan's California-street
stables, died yesterday afternoon in her
home. 147Tehama street, from the effects
of poison, supposed to have been con
tained in a can of condensed milk, some
of wnicn the little etiild ate at her evening
meal. The poison was a most violent one
and the baby suffered hours of agony be
fore she finally collapsed and died.
The case was a peculiar one. Mr. Kane
left the stable where he is employed
early in the evening and went to his
home. Supuer was prepared and all but
Mrs. Kane, who was indisposed, dined.
Condensed milk was used in the tea;
Florence Kane, 13 years of age, fed tbe
baby girl, and the father, after having
completed lib meal, put his children to
bed and retired soon alter himself.
At 1 o'clock yesterday morning Mr.
Kane was taken violently ill. He arose
and in looking for a remedy discovered
that his daughters were both in spasms.
He sent tor Doctors Rottanzi and Grunig,
wlio, when they arrived, diagnosed the
cause of the trouble as voisnn. Medicine
was administered to Mr. Kane and bis
oldest daughter and they were soon out of
danger.
Ethel, the baby, however, did not re
vive under the action of the drugs admin
istered. She went from spasm into spasm
and grew weaker with every passing
hour. The physicians remained by the
little sufferer's bedside, but their labors
proved useless. If the exact nature of the
poison had been known the child's life
could have in all probability been saved.
Slie lingered between life and death, un
conscious most of the time, until 2 o'c'ock
yesterday afternoon, when death took
place.
The case was reported at the Morgue
last evening and Deputy Coroner O'Brien
took charge of the body. The iemaining
milk in ttie can and the tea were taken for
chemical analysis. An autopsy will be
held to-day to determine the exact cause
of death and the nature of the poison that
caused it.

MOVEMENT FOR
CIVIC REFORM
A Growing Sentiment in
Favor of Better
Streets.
Shown by the Increasing Num
ber of Street Improve
ment Clubs.
President Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association Discusses the Ques
tion of Better Paving.
The BiKnificance of the present impetus
given to street improvement by the
recently formed organizations among the
residents and business men chiefly
interested therein, and the question of
civic reform generally, were discussed
yesterday by A. C. Dohrmann, the able
president of the Merchants' Association.
In Mr. Dohrmann's opinion, this move
ment on the part of our principal citizen?,
though not altogether without precedent
in the past, is an unmistakable indication
that the apathy which has too longexisted
in matters municipal, has almost disap
peared, and that henceforth wo may look
forward to continually increasing ameliora
tion. The remedy for present discontents,
he insisted, lies with the citizens them
selves, among whom intelligent co-opera
tion can accomplish much.
"The Merchants' Association," he said,
"has directed its attention to street im
provement since its inception, but these
local improvement clubs which have been
formed by the residents of Potk. Fourth,
Sixth, Fourteenth, Mission, Fillmore, De
visadero, Larkin and Kearny streets, etc.,
are comparatively new. The association
of improvement clubs seeKs to improve
realty, mostly in ibe suburbs, by putting
in sewers, opening up streets and so forth,
while the individual street-improvement
clubs are principally concerning them
selves wun the question of better lighting.
In other words, their standpoint is a com
mercial one. Tho former, with which our
association is aifiliated, will also make it
an object to guard the interests cf the
districts represented, initiate necessary
legislation and molÂ«i public opinion.
"It is well known that the Merchants'
Association has al! along agitated for
better pavements and tne removal of the
unsightly couble-stones in the downtown
portion of the City. We made a definite
attempt to accomplish this object two
years ago, but unfortunately the property
owners refused to come into line, contend
ing that this work properly belonged to
the City. The idea was then entertained
that a new charier would ultimately be
adopted and that better facilities for a
general scheme of improvement would
thereby be afforded. Now, however, that
the charter has been defeated. ,we are
renewing our efforts and hope to succeed.
No doubt the majority stiil adhere to the
principle that the City kselt should attend
to all such matters, but propert3*-owners
begin to rea.iize that if their property is to
retain its value they must do something
for the streets.
"lam satisfied that the present move
ment is the awakening of a better feeling
of citizenship and civic patriotism. Wiien
ever people try to improve their own im
mediate surround'ngs they are doing
something which helps the City as a
whole and creates a healthy sentiment,
which is sure to prow. So that the Mer
chants' Association has watched these
separate efforts with very great satisfac
tion, inasmuch as it enjoys the honor of
being the pioneer of reform.
"There are two theories concerning the
question of better paving. The advocates
of tne one urge that the citizens paid for
cobbles in the h'rst pluce and that the City
undertook to maintain them; it is, there
fore, so they say, tbe duty of the City to
substitute any other form of pavement
without extra assistance from the prop
erty-owners. The advocates of the second
theory hold that as the C.ty only asreed
10 maintain cobbles those who expect to
be benefited by new pnvemeuts should
help the City to "pay for them.
"We are now experimenting with
various kinds of paving material and be
iieve that thewooien pavement composed
of the Australian eucalyptus is the ideal
one for heavy traffic. Unfortunately the
present regulations permit basalt and
bitumen only, but sooner or later we shall
submit a proposition for the acceptance of
eucalyptus wood."
In concluson, Mr. Dohrmann expressed
!iis conviction ihat the various improve
ment cubs were all in touch with the
Uwditton and niiL'tu be relied on to sup
port any reasonable measure which the
.atter might see lit to propose in the near
future.

AT BETH JACOB
Dedication of Lights Cele
brated With Special
Services.
Rabbi Linezner D monstrates the
Frogress Made With the
Young Members.
Many Parts of the Festiva' Were
Rendered in Both Hebrew and
English Tongues.
Oakland Office San Fraxcirco Call,)
Â«08 Broadway, Nov. SB. i"
Beth-Jacob congregation commenced
the celebration tins evening of the festival
of Chanuka, or the dedication of the lights.
The festival lasts eight days, and each
evening a new lamp is lighted with great
ceremony.
Eubbi M. Linezner, although only a few
weeks with Beth-Jacob, has already
in igurated an active educational system
for the children ol its members, the object
being to familiarize t*iem with the history
of their race. The study of the German
and Hebrew languages is undertaken in
connection with the historical lessons,
but all other studies are left to the public
schools. The pupils of the school opened
to-day's proceedings with a. song.
Rabbi Linezner and pupils rendered
the manrive or evening service, and then
the rabbi performed the ceremony of dedi
cating the lights, and in this he was also
assisted by his pupils.
The ceremonies were made very inter
esting to all present. For ihe benefit of
those who did not understand the He
brew language Miss Sarah White gave
the English translation of the most inter
esting numbers. Gus Kingobky gave ti.e
Hebrew reading of Chanuka and also the
address on the dedication. 1. Buchman
read the history of the festival, and was
followed by an English >ong by tbe pupils.
From the remarks of H. J. Landers it
wbb learned that the school was in a very
flourishing and progressive condition and
was a very useful addition to the syna
gogue. Miss Jennie Buchman nad a
paper explanatory of the day and tbe
Mi-ses Sarah White. Augusta White and
.Martha Si verstein sang a trio.
Since Dr. Linezner's arrival at the
church marked progress has be> n made.
For some time Drior to his coming the
church had run down on account of hav
ing no permanent pastor. The 10-t ground

BERRY ROBBED AGAIN,
Two Bold Men Succeed in Se
cunng Forty-Five Dollars
in Gold.
The Bcdy of Harry Lomax Recovered
After Being in the Water Over
Four Months.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 29.â One of the
boldest and most successful robberies ever
perpetrated in this city occurred at an
early hour this morning, when two un
known men called Chariie Berry from his
house and relieved him of $45 in gold five
doiiar pieces. Berry is commonly known
as "Deaf Charlie," and resides near the
foot of Park street, opposite the electric
ii^ht station. He is considered to be in
good circumstances, and the victim of
eimila work several months apo.
Mr. Berry went home late last night,
and thinks now that he was followed by
the robbers. Out did not know it at; the
time. He was called to the door by re
peated knocltings, and as he opened it he
was grabbed by two men. His mouth was
closed by one and the entire pocket cut
by the other from his pants, in which he
carried the money. The men then made
their escape in the darkness. The officers
were notified ana a fairly good descrip
tion given them by Berry, but they refuse
to divulge the latter at present.
Berry has been very unfortunate of late.
Besides being robbed before he had an
accident wfth a buggy, and nearly lost his
life.
Harry I.omax's Kodjr Found.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 29â The body
of Harry Lomax, the 13- year-old sou of
K. R. Lomax, the blacksmith, who was
drowned on July 15, was recovered to-day
and brought into Weaver's undertaking
apartments. An inquest will be held at 9
o'clock to-morrow morning. The acci
dent occurred on the Hay Farm Island.
Daisy Lomax. accompanied by her brother
Jlarry. agei 16 years, left the Park-street
Station on the loth of July, by the narrow
gaune train, 'or High street on n fishing
excursion. They walked to the bridge and
sat down on a platform under the string
ers of the drawbridge, where they fished
for some time. In gome back home the
boy suddenly fell into the water and w.i.s
drowned. It is thought he was seized
with a cramp in the chest, and this cau ed
him to fall backwards into the water, or he
might have lost his foot in sr.
The girl screamed for help and was
aboutto jump into the water, but some
men who had heard her cries caught hold
of her jtist in time. The boy was not seen
U? the men. and as a strong tide was com
ing in they could do nothing. Searca was
m;id^ for the bo ly and a number of per
hon.i dragged about the spot where he fell
into the water for the balance of the day.
The remains were located near San Lo
renzo ijindini; last evening. The boy's
mother has been seriously ill for several
weeks and it is leared tnai the shock will
be more than she can bear.
Donated to the Library.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Not. 29.â The public
library, claimed to be the beat of any of
its class uj on the coast, was tv-day pre
wnted witli a full set of the ''Tiouveiot

Brothers of this city. The books are valued
at $100.

the public, with the utmost accuracy,
minuteness and beauty, the chief eeleaital

wonderful progress of modern research and
the power of moiiern instruments now
present them to the trained eye of the as

THE LADY AND THE DRESS
Pertinent Comments on a Recent
Masquerade Seguel â The Â£s
tuary Uridge.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 29.â The man
agers of the masquerade balls that have
been held up to th;s part of the season re
gret that they have departed from their
usual custom of naming committees of
awaras. This city has three daily papers,
and the custom has been to appoint their
representatives on the all-important com
mittee Â£t a mask ball. There has never
been any appeal from their judgment and
all were satisfied. When the Merry Mon
archs held their ball a few nights ago a
committee acquainted with the maskers
was appointed and the result may yet be
tragic. The whole of the Bay District has
become interested in that ball, and Mis*
Minnie Riley and Mrs. Diilingbam have
been forced to deiend tnoir respective
types of beauty, their tastes, their honor
and truthfulness und also their financial
condition through the press. All this has
been very humiliating to Golden Gate and
Emeryvillp society and more sensational
developments are yet expected.
"We've had lots of trouble," sajd a
manager this week, "that we didn't have
when we let the reporters have the choice,
and I guess we'll have to go back to the
old order of thing?. You see a reporter
never has any lady friends, and he don't
pay any attention to masked faces, and
so he passes an opinion solely on the
costumes, and that's what we want. Then
again, a newspaperman doesn't pass half
bis time ai the bar, and co he is not l.fcely
to get muddled, and altogether they make
thf best judges."
This masquerade manager is to be con
gratulated on his correct conception.
If the best interests of Oakland harbor
are consulted there will be but one bridge
across the estuary in the future. There is
no traffic that requires two bridges, and
the increasing shipping in the harbor and
the projected improvements make it im
perative that there shall be a minimum ot
obstruction across the estuary. It is a
very difficult matter to tow a bi^ ship
through two drawbridges unless both are
opened at once and the tug can have a
clear passage. For^years shipping men
have been complaining of the delays oc
casioned by the two drawbridges, and to
sailing schooners that have to beat up or
down the channel the loss is very great.
Within the past month some large bunk
ers and wharves have been opened in the
upper harbor, and tne contract for others
was only let a few days ago. , This means
that the largest class of vesseis will soon
be navigating the upper harbor, ana to
have to pass two bridges, when but one is
necessary, :s only a needles increase of
danger. fcTUABT W. Booth.

Three Kojg and a Hun.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. Three boys
with a sun met with a serious accident
this afternoon, ami it is thought one of
uie:n will die. Jonn Donovan, Harry
Canty and John Strisch, all lads about 12
years of age, went out on the Alanuda
marsh this afternoon to shoot rail. They
nad with tnem one 'ordinary" shotgun
They were crossing a. creek, and were
passing the gun, which was cocked, from
one to the other, handling it carelessly
from stock to muzzle. The gun went off
just when, all the three lads were in the
j.ne of tire. Canty, received nearly the
whole charge in his breast arid face, and
some of the shot entered his lungs. He is
very badly injured, ana is suffering from
internal hemorrhages, and it is' thought
he cannot recover. Donovan's : little
and third fingers of one hand "were; shot
off, and Strisch received a few shots in the
face,, hut the injuries of the two last na m.-d
ire not serious?. The boys were so badly
frightened . that they V cannot remember
who held the gun when it went off. The
lads were treated by i Dr. Hamlin- at the

STUDENTS MUST
MAKE MUSCLE,
Physical Culture to Form
an Important Factor
in High Schools.
Well- Trained Athletes May En
ter College in the
Future.
Professor Magee of Berkeley to
Deliver Four Lectures on
"Physical Culture."
BERKELEY, Cau, Nov. 28. â Gym
nasium work bids fair to become a part of
the curriculum of every Higti School in
the State. Well-trained track athletes
and sturdy football men may soon be de
veloped outside of the university. The
time may not be far distant when mile
runners, sprinters, hammer-throwers and
halfbacks will enter college with records
equal to any held by the best of ou-r uni
versity athletes of to-day.
The tirst step in this direction was taken
to-day when Profee^or Walter E. Magee
of the department of physical cuitur at
the State University left for Southern Cali
fornia to deliver a coarse of four lectures
W. E. Magee, Professor of Physi
cal Culture.
on "Physical Culture" before the annual
session or the Southern California Teach
ers' Association. Never before in tho his
tory of education in California have lec
tures on the development of the physique
been given by a professor from the uni
versity o-.ilsidfc of the college walla.
Immeliatflly npon his election to a pro
fesaorship Mr. Muget- set about to prepare
a course of lectures on physical culture,
to be delivered to the hi K lj school students
of the Stitte. The data on the training
and development of the human body,
which he baa been ga hering ever since
becoming connected wi h the university
eight years ago. has he en arranged ami
compiled, together with a quantity of
notes w .ich he has recently taken espe
cially for tne purpose.
The lectures by Professor Magee at the
session of Southern California teachers
are considered as the forerunners of a
coarse of prescribed work in physical
training in every preparatory school of
the Slate. The interest along that line in
the secondary schools has been rapidly in
creasing for several year* p:ist. As a re
sult of this precollefiate training the stu
dents who have entered the university
within the last two years have been much
belter developed than their predecessors
of four or five years act).
It is the purpose of the university to
still further* encourage this systematic
exercise in the public school.*, and to tliat
end Professor Maeee will work at such
tiniea as he can get away from his duties
at Berkeley.

ALLIANCE DISAPPOINTED.
Xot Chosen aa Guard of Honor to the
President-Klect.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 29.â The dis
patch from Canton, Ohio, relating to the
personal escort of President-elect McKin
ley came like a thunderclap to the Repub
lian Alliance of Oakland. It stated that
the Eighth Regiment of the Ohio Na
tional Guard has been selected to act as
Major McKinley's personal escort to
Washington from Canton.
Since the election the alliance has hoped
that it would be accorded the honor of be
ing Major McKinley's personal escort.
They had some ground for their hope.
Alameda County suved California for Mc-
Kinley, and the alliance worked ao hard
during the campaign that it naturally
considered it had some right to recogni
tion.
The arrangements for a trip to Canton
for the purpose of escorting th President
elect to Washington were taken up m
earnest, but were h eld in abeyance until
it w<:b known whether the Alliance would
be chosen or not.
The news of to-day has proved a big dis
appointment to the crack political regi
ment of the State.
MARRIED FIFTY YEARS.
Four Generation* Attend the Edwards

wards came to California to prospect in
the mines. He was lucky and when he
quit uiininp he came to Oakland to live
and has since made his home here.

PALO'S SIGN OF SILENCE
The Accused Murderer Signaled
Mrs. Parenti After the
Style of Italy.
Quick M^vem nts of the Hand Over
the Forehead a Solemn Re
quest for Siii nee.
There has been a great deal of curiosity
in Italian quarters and elewhere aÂ« to
what L. J'alo, charged with the murder of
Agostino Parent!, meant in the Coroner's
office on Saturday when, during the testi
mony, he suddenly aro;-e and sought to
quiet Parenti's widow by a few mysteri
ous words and signs that none of the Ital
ians present under>tood.
Mrs. Parenti was almost hysterical dur
ing the giving of evidence bearing on her
husband's death. She wept aloud and
ejaculated many strange sentences in Ital
ian during the progress of the case.
Suddenly Paio, the accused man, arose,
spoke one or two commanding words of so
cabalistic a character that none of the
Italians understood them, made a ruvs
terious motion across his forehead and sat
down.
Coroner Hawkins was angry over the
proceeding, but the woman was effectu
ally quelled. When her eyes met I'ulo's
she ceased her noise ami went to the next
room, where she speke no more, but
sobbed quietly during the entire proceed
ing.
There were rumors yesterday that the
liana were those of La Mafia, but lialians
do not credit the story. Speaking of t;e
â¢igO* yesterday Joseph Marini, who has
traveled widely over Itaiy, said: "Some
suca crossing of the head as is reported to
have occurred during the trial is the super
stitious and somewhat solemn warning
resurtfd to by peasants in Southern Italy
when they desire to impress upon a Iriend
the idea ihat speech may be followed b/
dire disaster. I might say it is a prayer or
imprecation, invoking God to make i lie
person addressed remain quiet. Why
Palo wanted the woman to remain quiet I
do not know, but I believe the sign was
nothing but a solemn injunction to keep
still."

HOW POOR LO
CAME TO AMERICA
Learned Theory That the
Indian Race Originated
in Asia.
Led Here From Jerusaien and
Later Cursed With a
Red Skin.
E. H Nye, President of the California
Mormon Mission, on th? S iution of
a Great Problem.
E. H. Nye, president of the California
Mormon Mission, preached yesterday at
9i.Â»9^ Market street on the origin ol the
American Indian. He said substantially:
From the time the Americas have been re
garded as a continent, separate and distinct
irom the Old World, and more especially since
immigration from the Eastern < ouilnent has
developed here the mighiy Nation' of the
present, the question which perhaps above all
others has perplexed the mind of every histo
rian, archseoiigst and thinking man, who has
given the matter serious reflection, is:
Who is the American Indian? Whence came
these dusky braves, whose council tires, two
centuries ago, rose i i every valley from Hud
sou's Bay to farthest Florida and from ocean
to ocean? .
Historians agree that, notwithstanding the
central nimuarity of the native American
nations In form, feature, color, hair ana
speech they were widely separated in culture.
On the table-lands of Mexico, Central America
and Peru lived nations which, as compared
with the rest of the world, may be proucrly
termed civilized. Indeed, tue archaeologists
of the pres nt in their very recent discoveries
in those districts are proving beyond the
question of a doubt that they were once the
homes of a people highly cultured and highly
civilized.
In Bancroft's "Native Races" that locality is
referred to as the seat of a mighty empire
which grew and flourished until it reechea
the zenith of its power, then became corrupted
and fell, leaving only its mighty ruins to mark
its glorious past.
Large cities have been unearthed, revealing
ruins of great worKH of architecture, master
pieces oi art and science, demonstrating the
fact that those districts were once the Seat of
a wealthy and powerful people. Different
theories are extant an to their origin and his
tory. -Some contend that America was peo
pled from Europe, some from Africa, some
irom Asia. Many believe thai the Mexicans
were originally Jews, or descendants ot the
ten tribe* of Israel. Yet none of these differ
ent theories seem to satisiy even the men who
advance them, and after a research of nearly
four hundred years they almost unanimously
agree that they are as far from a. satisfactory
conclusion as in the beginning. It seems that
an impenetrable veil has been stretched before
them by an omnipotent hand, beyond which
science has not had power to pass. Why fur
ther^pursue these unsuccessful attempts to
fathom these mysteries by means of science?
Why not turn the full rays of light upon the
subject, solve the problem and put an end to
these vain attempts?
Tne Book oi Mormon', purporting to be a his
tory of the predecessors of the American In
dian, offers, among others, the 'following' evi
dences corresponding with the discoveries of
the age: On pages 302 and 303 may. be found
an accurate description of the country now
known as Guatemala and Yucatan. This
country is therein represented as the grand
center of civilization of a mighty nation. An
account is also given of the destruction of
many of those large,' flourishing cities, viz.:
"And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths
of the t-ea and the inhabitants thereof were
diowned." That city now lies beneath the
ocean waves between the mainland lAt Vera
Cruz and the Han Juan de Ulloa. (See Ban
crott's Native Races.) - â¢â â â â¢.. .
â¢â¢Yea, and the city of Oulhah and the inhab
itants thereof, and the city of Mocum and the
inhabitants thereof, and the city of Jerusalem
and the inhabitants thereof; and waters have
I caused to come up in the place thereof to
hide their wickedness and abominations from
before my face, that the blood of the prophets
and the saints shall not come up any more
unto me against them." In the locality some
times called the "Lake District," in the prov
ince of Petin, between Guatemala and Yuca
tan, in two of the lai.es are unmistakable evi
dences of cities having been sunk beneath
the waters (Bancroft). , â¢â¢
â  "And behold that great city Jacobugath,
: which was inhabited by the people of Jacob,
have I caused to be burned with fire. And
behold the city of Laman, and the city of
Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kish
kimmen have I caused to be burned with tire
and the inhabitants thereof, because of their
wickedness in casting out the prophets and
stoning those Whom I did send to declare unto
them concerning their wickedness and t&eir
abominations.' ' ...
The cities of Copan, Uxmal, Ococuigo, City
of Palaces, Chichen, lisa and Palauque are
among the number now known to have been
discovered. I'alauque is accredited as being
the oldest city oi America. Great massive
ruins of stonework, palaces, castles, aqueducts
and other skillful works of masonry, home of
which are imbedded with a heavy growth :o
huge timbers, now mark this {civilization of
the past throughout- Yucatan und adjoining
country. La Plonjon is authority for the state
ment of upwards of fifty such cities Laving al
ready been discovered in Yucatan. 'â 
The sacred resting pla".e of the golden treas
ure containing the records of the piedecessors
of the American Indian was revealed to Joseph
Smith as follows:
In the year 1824 Smith received a visitation
from a.â¢ heavenly messenger, who directed
him to a place now known throughout the
State of New York as . Mormon Hill, and
pointed out to him the sacred spot where the
plates were concealed. He was permitted to
take them fortn, and by the power of God he
was enabled to translate the reformed Egyp
tian and Hebrew characters thereon engraved
into the English . language. Tne work was
given to the world id 1827 under the title of
"The Book of Mormon." This was years be
fore any of the discoveries her in mentioned
were made. It purports to be tie history of a
' race of people who sprang from one Lthl, to
whom a heavenly mess .tiger appeared in Jeru
salem about fourteen years prior to the ' de
struction of that city in the days of Zedcktab,
KingofJudab. According to his instructions
Lehi fled' from the city and was miraculously
led by the hand of God through a wilderness
to the sea, where his people were commanded
to build a ship. Having accomplished this* tusk
they embarked for the promised land, trust
ing the Almighty to guide them to their desti
nation.
They. landed, as near as can : now be told,
on the const of Guatemala, Here they built
them cities, founded empires, grew, prospered
and spread, over all adjacent country and
ling up to the time o> the coming, of the
savior became very- wicked.' At the time of
.the (k'sith of our; Lord at Palestine there were
three diys of total darkness in this- land.
Earthquakes, tempests, tornadoes, etc., swept
over v.ie lÂ«nd, destroying many cities of tne
wicked, as. before referred to. (See Book of
Mormon, paces ' 495-7.) Jesus said to his
Apostles in Palestine. juÂ«t prior to his ascen
tibn: "Other sheep have 1, which are not of
tnis io'.d. 'lh , too, 1 must visit, teat there
may be one to; and one shepherd"
(John x:16). ) -. "-â '-- .'.,,â  -â 
In accor.iap.ee therewith, at the close of the
three* days' darkness, , he appeared to -. the
people on . this continent," taught them his
gospel, selected and. ordained ; twelve apostles
and organized his churcu as he had done in
Palestine. ' . â¢ ..-â¢
This church and organization continued in
its perfection for 300 years and the people
were righteous.' At about ; that time they
began to: drift; away from ' tho doctrines of
Christ into .wickedness . and. abominations,
until the white race were totally destroyed as
a people. -The lust greet battle was tooxDt
near the place before, referred 'to as Mormon,
Hill, where the records were deposited at that
time by the last writer. Moroni. 'â¢Â£t9Â£SsMgnsK
â¢ Lehi was a -descendant .ot " the tribe of
Jos .-ph. through Ephraitn. .Shortly after their
arrival in the promised land two of ; the sons
of Lehi rebelled against their father : and
brothers, ..became, a ; separate . people and
finally made war against them.
The Lord revealed the fact to Lehi'-j people
that their enemies were coining against' them
in war and had 'pain themselves red to ap

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Property Interests Develop
ing an Upward Ten
dency.
Two Lccal Auction Sales Sched
uled for This
Month.
Matters in the Building Line Promise
a Large Increase by Next
Spring.
Among the real estate agents there Is a
growing conviction that thoir business is
tending upward, and the market hits assumed
a more satisfactory tone. And yet it cannot be
conceded that the slight improvement is suffi
cient to induce owners to stiffen pr^os n .be
cause the demand must be very mucti.'better
than it is now before values can be materially
affected. It is well to know, however, mat the
real estate business shows signs of the ap
proach of prosperous times; or, rather, that
the worst is past, and San Francisco is
steadily, if slowly, improving. Many prop
erty-owners are obtaining loans on their
possessions, ana an analysis of â  the. applica
tions reveals the fact that the mortgagers are
not compelled to borrow money, but, ou the |
contrary, are seeking loans with which to im- j
prove their property.
This is at least taken as an Indication of en- \
terprise, and one that promises a great deal.
It touches .slightly on the speculative, though j
lacking the essential qualities of speculation, :
inasmuch as the land offered as security is re- .
garded with absolute good faith as more than '
enough reason for expending money in im
proving it. From such a condition real estate !
men argue that confidence is returning to
people interested in realty.
The nistory of the different periods of de- i
pression in" business which have occurred
within the history of this City would afford!
an instructive lesson upon the stable condition I
on which San Francisco business rests, and the I
causes of lecovery which have to c. early ,
manifested themselves during the past few j
weeks. .
Proppfty value?, especially in growing
centers of trade, are not an accurate index of
the degree of prosperity such a place may
enjoy. In but few cities of the United States j
are property values tjxed. There is the specu- i
lative features of buvlng and selling property |
which too often eitner leads the investor to j
pay more than the property is worth from the i
standpoint of a â  business investment, or to j
undervalue the property and make an offer i
that is considerably below what it actually i
<ju','ht to sell for.
In one case he makes the investment on a :
prospective valuation thtit the property will
attain at some time in the near future, and in
the other instance he considers the actual
conditions as they may , exist during some
period of great depression, and places a value '
on the property which is fit* below the amount '
represented by its actual intrinsic worth. â 
The general rule, however, that investments ;
in property are safe, has been exemplified in j
San Francisco just as it has in every other;
prominent city of the United States, and the j
person who makes a judicious investment in i
San Francisco property to-day will realize the j
fame returns on this Investment as the
thousands of people who nave already made
fortunes out of San Francisco realty.
There is some property in .San Francisco 1
that has been sold on a speculative basis; the i
large amount of property, however, included I
within the thickly settled pait of the City '
may at this time be considered, as possessing a i
value that has all the element.- of stability.
The desirable property of San Francisco has j
always formed a basis of credit which has pre- '
vented anything like a crisis in ihe finances of
the City. It is probably a safe prediction that
should* the occasion require it â en issue that
has never been brought before the San Fran
cisco people an amount of money could De
secured by "San Francisco's wealthy property
owners that would carry this City safely
through five or six years of as great a depres- ;
sion as was experienced in this country in
1803.
Aside from San Francisco's assets in income
producing property, however, this City, as the
financial center of the Pacific Coast, has a 1
fund set aside for a rainy day that has not
only carried San Francisco, but a large part of
the Pacific slope, through one of the most
disastrous panics the country ever witnessed.
San Francisco's representative banks, with
one or two exceptions, have always been safely
managed, and these banks to-day are among
the strongest In the country.
It is no idle boast to say that in point of
commercial stability San Francisco ranks with
any city of the United States. This fact is rec
ognized all over the Union as well as in every
financial center in Europe. San Francisco's
wealth was won in legitimate tiade and man
ufactures and, being based on the ; natural re
sources of the country, grew in proportion to
the development of the agricultural and min
eral resources of the region for which she was
the mart. These agencies have contributed to
the building up of a substantial city of 350,
-000 people, with the most extensive jobbing
trade, the leading manufactures and the
largest shipping interests on the Pacific Coast.
The average Eastern man familiar with the
methods of "boomed" cities of the far West,
when he visits San Francisco, is usually sur
prised when he finds here not only extensive
commerce, but so many large financial institu
tions, business-houses and manufactories es
tablished on an absolutely sound basis and
conducting their affairs on sound business
principles, which more than one Western City
could adopt with profit.
PROSFKCTS FOE BUILDING. -
The following extracts on the building busi
ness for the past mouth and the prospects of

King it McNally and have located a real estate
I office at 030 Market street. Mr. King has lor
| many years been prominently identified in
the real estate business in this City and Mr.
! McNally until recently was a member of the
lirni of "Tobin & McNally, real estate gents.
For the purpose of formulating a Ulan to se
cure better pavements on a few of the down
town streets, the Merchants' Association has
called a meeting of property-owners on Post
street, irom Montgomery to Stockton; Geary
street, from Kearny to Powell, end Stockton
street, from Market to Suiter. The meeting
will be held on Wednesday afternoon at 3
o'clock, in the assembly-room of the Mills
building.
Property-owners on Seventeenth street are
ngain discussing the advisability of extending
that thoroughfare from Uranus street west to
the park, wnich will give the Mir. si on district
a direct outiet to Ashbury Heights and the
park. The street is now blocked at Uranus
street by a bluff some fifty feet in height.
Several of the legislators have been inter
viewed by the property-owners in reference io
the proposed extension, nnd there wiil prob
ably be a biil introduced at Sacramento at the
next meeting authorizing the City to form an
assessment aistnet to extend the street.
There wiil be a meeting of the airectors and
members of the Pacific Union Club this even
ing to ratify the purchase of the property at
the northeast corner of Bush street and "Van
Ness avenue. Subscriptions for the bonds,
amounting to $250,000, to pay for the lot and
building are said tv have been raised. The
club's lease of its present quarters at Post and
Stockton streets will expire in about four
months, but it is likely the rooms can be re
tained until the new home is completed.
The action of the Supervisors in allowing
cobblestones to be replaced with basalt blocks
and bitumen, the City to stand half the ex
pense and the proDeTiy-owners the other half,
should have the effect of better pavements on
many of the City's btreets which are at pres
ent a disgrace.
There will be a meeting next Thursday
evening of property-owners and merchants
ulong ihe line of Fillmore street, between Sut
ler and Washington, for the xmrpose of
forming a permanent organization to be
known as the Fillmore-street) Improvement
Club. The moving spirits in the formation
of the club are determined that Fiilmore street
shall be one of the most attractive and bril
liantly lighted thoroughfares In the Western
| Addition.
Tne time for paying the first installment of
I tuxes expires to-day at ti p. v.. and to-morrow
115 per cent will be added to the amount. On
, the 4th of next January the next installment
i will become due and payable, and if not paid
] by April 20 a penalty of 5 per cent will be
i added. If the first installment will become
due and payable 5 per cent will be added to
the previously imposed fine of 15 per cent.
All of the taxes may be paid at once at the
time of the first payment.
Persons who have paid personal property
taxes at the rate charged last year will have
the difference between this and last year's rate
refunded to them.
The Panhandle Imprdvement club will hold
its annual meeting to-morrow evening at the
â  Columbia Cyclery Hall on Page street near
: Stuuyau. During the pÃst year this club has
j done much toward advancing the interest of
I property matters south of the Parlc and west of
: Baker street, ana to the untiring efforts of its
president, C. I). Salrieid, is due niucn of the
: progress made in improvement* brought
I about by the club. To this gentleman the
! property-owners in the district have much to
| be thankful for, and in recognition for his ser
i vices will probably so express themselves At
i to-morrow's meeting.
The club has petitioned the Supervisors to
j have Haight and Page streets, from Baker to
I Stanyan, curbed, and also to have sidewalks
j laid.
The club is anxious to have the unsightly
| fence which surrounds the railroad depot at
| Sianyan and Haight streets removed, and have
: already petitioned the Board of Supervisors to
; order it taken down.

PETER VAN CLIEF
AMONG THE DEAD
Sketch of the Life of an
Eminent Citizen and
Jurist.
High Testimonials to the Char-
acter of Another '40,21-
Who Is Gone.
The Creation cf an Intermediary
Court May Prevent the Appoint
ment of His Successor.
The State of California has lost another
honored citizen and an eminent jurist
from the roll of its pioneers.
At 1:30* o'clock yesterday afternoon
Judge Peter Van Clief, Commissioner of
the Supreme Court, after a lingering ill
ness of two months, died at the residence
of his son-in-law, W. F. Herrin, the prom
inent Southern Pacific Company's attor
ney, at 2530 Broadway.
Many old friends at Downieville, where
ihe Judge practiced law in â¢ his earlier
days, heard of his death later in the alter
noon, and the fact that the flags ot
Downieville are now flying at half-mast
snows the widespread esteem in which he
was held in that city. A telegram re
ceived by Mr. Herrin last evening notified
him that the flags had been lowered out
of respect ior the dead jurist.
The ran^e of Peter Van Cliefs life shows
a broad experience aDd a self-reliant char
acter. There is no better illustration of
the latter fact than a little episode in his
career which occurred at the Platte River,
where he was one man among many who
came in a flock of prairie schooners which
left Ohio for California when the flow of
people first began to follow the setting
sun.
The party arrived at the Platte River,
which was then greatly swoilen by rains
or thaws of mountain snow. They were
afraid to ford it, and decided to camp on
the banks until the volume of water sub
sided. Young Peter Van Clief dissented.
He "warn the river with his gun, and
alone across the wilderness made his way
to California. He claimed to be the first
white man who saw Lake Tahoe.
hie first went into Nevada, Piumas and
Sierra counties, where he followed the oc
cupation of a miner for a whi!e. Then he
took up the practice of law with consider
able success, having read law in Ohio be
fore he started West, his headquarters
being in Downieville. In 1853 he was ap
pointed Judge of the old Seventeenth Dis
trict Court, including the counties of
Sierra and Piumas, t>y Governor Welier.
After his term expired he praciiced law
in and about Downieville from about l#JO
to about 1870. Then he went to Marysviile,
where he continued in the practice of his
profession till about 1877, when he came
to San Francisco and here he has since
resided.
There was no better legal talent on the
coast in those days than was found at
Downieville, and Peter Van Clief was one
of the most prominent in hia profession.
He was interested in every case* of impor
tance which came into court.
From 1852 up to about tne date of the
Civil War there were in practice In
Downieville, in addition to Judge Van
Clief, such nonor^d moi 33 Airon A. Sar
gent, Niles Scnrles, Harry I. Thornton,
Senator W. A. Stewart and Judge McFar
land.

Van Clief usually spent his summer* in
Downieville and his winters here. In
May, 1889, he was appointed one of the
Commissioners of the Supreme Court by
the court, and he continued to be a com
missioner up to the t:me of his death, lie
was born In the State of Ohio, January 26,
1818â78 years of age.
Judge Van Clief wrote a number of
sound articles for newspapers on the con
stitutional amendment in 1863, and a
Fourth of July oration which he deliv
ered in Downieville in 18U5 is another in
dication of his interest in public and Na
tional affairs. Many other articles of a
political nature were written by him and
published, but the fact that he seldom
signed them is an illustration of his
modest personality. He was a man who
did not seefc notoriety.
He took a prominent part in the noted
debris ca~es in 1577-78. The first action in
that case, the title of which was Keys vs.
The Little York Mining Company, ;vas
brought by Jud^e Van Clief, and he may
be said to have initiated this litigation.
The Judge leaves several children and a
widow. By his first marriage he leaves
two dauehter â Mrs. Hiram L. Gear of San
Francisco and Mrs. Cowdeti of Phoenix,
Ariz. The only child of his second mar
riage is now Mrs. W. P. Herriu.
Judge Van Clief was a man of the high
est integrity and a fast friend whose char
acter was unfolded the fullest only to his
intimate friends. He has been suoken of
as a man of "impracticable honesty." He
had a judicial mind, was a man of wide
learning and thoroughly fitted for the re
sponsible position he held.
Judge Thomus B. McFarland, Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of California,
has known Judge Van Ciief for many
years. He said last evening: "I am sur
prised to learn of his death. Peter Van
Cliei was a man of much ability and
learning. He was thorough-going and
nad a laree practice before lie went on the
bench. I have known him since 1855
or '50."
Judge Niles Sear! es, an associate com
missioner, has known Judge Van Clief
since 1852. He was seen last night at his
apartments in the St. Nicholas Hotel. He
said: "I have known Peter Van Clref
intimately for over forty years. He was a
good lawyer, had a thorough and logical
mind, a fine constitution, and had won
derful industry. He was not a great jury
lawyer, but in the argument of Taw ques
tions and the preparation of briefs for the
court ot last resort he had very few supe
riors. He understood words and their
meaning and the English language thor
oughly.
"He left in August, I think, on his
vacation. He returned from a stag?
ride down the mountains, where he
hid mining claims, strained in his right
shoulder'and side. This extended to bis
stomach and for weeks be realized he was
on his deathbed. Judge Van Clief has
lived a useful life. He did not make as
much noise as many men o< half his abil
ity. He was thorough, able and an honest
lawyer."
Tiie question of Judge Van Chef's suc
cessor has already arisen in those circles
which realize the importance of the posi
tion. The salary of Supreme Court Com
missioner is $tiooo a yeur, as much as the
Justices of the Supreme Court. The legis
lative act creating the Supreme Court
Commissioners will expire next May, and
the question has arisen as to whetlier the
Legislature this winter will continue the
commission.
There has been a feeling among the
attorneys of California for several years
that an appellate court, which shall have
final jurisdiction and power in cases of a
certain class, should be created, and if
such action be taken this winter by the
Legislature the Supreme Court Commis
sioners will be abolished. This feeling is
said to be widespread, and, under the cir
cumstances, it is considered doubtlul that
the Supreme Court will make an appoint
ment to the vacancy, or that any compe
tent lawyer would accept an appointment
for so uncertain a term.

RACING AGAIN
ON THIS SIDE
Ingleside Furnishes a Great
Card of Running
Evsnts.
A Number of Eastern Horses at
the Barrier ior the First
Time.
Damien and Salisbury II Will Try
Conclusions Over a Mileâ The
Coming Winter's Sale.
By far the most attractive card of the
season is the one offered race eoers to-day
at Ingleside, the opening d.ty of the semi
monthly meeting. The good horses who
have gradually been "keyed up to it" are
beginning to make their appearance and
the splendid lot of entries in the different
events to be decided this afternoon has
awakened renewed interest in the game.
The action of the Incieside Association
in offering a $.">OO purse each day for a race
over a distance of ground, meets with the
hearty approval of all owners and the
Pacific Coast Jockey Ciub is to be con
gratulated for its enterprise. Too many
"dog" dashes work a detriment to the
sport and are not popular with the public.
Among the starters which will face the
barrier to-day for the first time on either
of the local courses are: Tom Elmore,
Morte Fonse, The Dragon, (Salvation,
Woodchopper, Clisse B and Gutta Percha,
all very cood performers. In the mile
dash Salisbury 11, who was worked on a
full mile, which he finished in l:40lÂ£ at
the conclusion of his winning race at Oak
land on Saturday, will Jock horns with
Pat Dunne's Damien, and it will not be
surprising if the track record of I:4l}^ is
lowered.
Charles Carmichael, owner of the well
known racehorse, Cash Day. registered at
a downtown hotel last evening from Chi
cago.
Ab Etemler has been obliged to retire
some of the El Primero stable horses
temporarily on account of various ail
ments. The speedy Fleur de Lis broke
down and Lodestar is also in a bad way
from lameness. I'ueno, the black horse,
is not doing well, and altogether the
string is in a badly crippled condition.
Marty Bergen, the quiet and gentle
manly jockey froiu New York, is back
with us again this winte-. Marty may
possibly not ride with the same dash anS
vfgor of former days, out he is honest and
his mounts always come in for substantial
backing.
Reports from New York say the popu
lar trainer James McCormick is not
mending very rapidly. His little son and
daughter will leave here for home on Sat
urday next and rumor has it that the
trainer's condition is very precarious.
The yearlings from Theodore Winters'
Rancho del Sierra â twenty-one in ail â
will pass under the hammer on Wednes
day evening, December 3, at Killip & Co.'s
salesyard. Market street and Van Ness
avenue, and a superb-looking lot they are.
James Grant, manager for Mr. Winters,
has charge of the youngsters, and with a
great deal of pride shows the racy-looking
sons and daughters of El Rio Rey and Joe
Hooker to visito s. Among those to be
sold are a brother to Belle Boyd, a full
brother to Bonanza and a brother to
Quantreil. In alluding to the latter hand
some colt, Mr. Grant says if he is not a
racehorse he will quit guessing. A filly
by El Rio Rey from the great mare Louise
M is considered one of the stars of the
sale. In 189*2, at Chicago, Louise M
showed the way to Racine in a mile and a
furlong stake event, the first mile of which
was covered in 1 :38}/Â£.
Speaking of El Rio Rey, who swept
everything before him as a two-year old
and was the idol of American racegoers,
Manager Grant says the big chestnut
looks in grand condition and acts as
though he would like ones more to an
swer the post call. What a rare drawing
card he would be if Mr. Winters could be
indnced to exhibit him at the coming
Horse Show.
The California Jockey Club will put a

FITCH IN THE FIGHT.
Chief Crowley's Old Opponent Looking
for the Superintenclency of
MiDiii Buildings.
The Board of Education-elect is caucus
ing now and apportioning out the patron
ag ' to the lucky ones who are able to get
chairmanships.
The main purpose of the next meeting
j is supposed to be the appointment of a
| Superintendent of the Building of Schools,
one of the most important positions in
the department, in view of the fact that
the board must rely upon that official's
I report in all matters pertaining to build
j ins; and remodeling.
Superintendent Kincaid, who is the in
cumbent, runs a strong fi r st in the fight.
There are numerous other candidates â
O'Brien, Casey, McNamara and Con
nelly â who have never figured before the
public in search of the appointment, so it
is to b<Â» presumed that Kincaid. will have
a walkover against them.
It is not so, however, with Ben Fitch, a
first-class mechanic of the old school,
whose claim for precedence is getting a
j strong backing.
Fitch is part of the history of this State
and Nevada. He was the foreman in the
building of the Montgomery block, one of
the iew remaining landmarks of pioneer
days. He built the courthouse, jail and
State University at Eiko, .NVv., where he
| was Sheriff in 1868-72 and in 1880-84.
But the most interesting part of Ben
Fitch's career is when, in the 70s. he was
a candidate ngainst Patrick Crowley, the
incumbent, for the position of Chief of
Police of this City ana County.
W. C. Ralston, the Jim Fisk of Califor
nia, was then in his plory, and he favored
Crowiey, and that settled Ben Fitch's
chances. He was defeated an. l went back
to Â£!ko. He has been a resident of this
State for more than five years, and he
hopes to be seen at work again building
the public schools.
PAUL BREON 'S DEATH.
The Commission Merchant Succumbs to
a Strake of Paralyais at the
Baldwin Hotel.
Paul Breon, a prominent merchant of
the firm of Wheaton, Breon <fe Co., died of
paralysis at his apartments in the Baldwin
Hotel yesterday morning. He was pros
trated by a paralytic stroke two weeks
ago. and since that time the attending
physicians had little hope of his ultimate
recovery.
Mr. Breon was an active and auccpssful
merchant. As a post trader at Fort Yunia
and in general merchandise business on
the frontier he acquired considerable I
money. About eight years ago he bought !
an inteiest in the firm of commission mer- i
chants, of which George H. Wheaton is
the senior partner, and since devoted him
self diligently to business.
During the" World's Columbian Exposi
tion at Chicago Mr. and Mrs. Breon lost
their only son. a young man 'M yeare of
age. The snock was so severe that the
mother's life was in peril for some mouths.
Mr. Breon was a companionable and
genial man, but his sorrows drew him
closer to his business in tne day and to his
home circle in the evening. So he was
not as widely known as others of less force
in the mercantile community. He w:is a
member of the Bohemian Club and very
highly regarded by his fellow-members.
Mr. Breon was born in Lorraine and was
53 years of age.
WILL HAIR GROW
ON BALD HEADS?
Benefits of Professor New
comb's Efforts in
Massachusetts.
Douglass White and Others Most
Interested Are Very
Hcpeiul.
A Discovery That May Change the
Appearance cf the Front
Row at a Ballet.
Again comes a remedy for bald head?.
Like the cures for colds, rheumatism
and every other ailment, a panacea blos
soms on ihe twigs of every tree; humani
tarians pluck and hand it around.
It is different this time in one respect,
for it is allied in a way to the mysterious
X rays.
Professor George Newcomb, demon
strator of physics at the State Normal
School of Salem, Mass. , is the discoverer
of the new process that is likely to turn
the front rows of a ballet dress circle into
the strong hirsute vegetation of a football
team.
Edison seems to have caused the blind
10 see by means of the X rays, ana New
comb believes he can make dead, decayed
or lethargic hair bulls come to life,
fresh or vigorous, by means of the high
induction coil.
Professor Newcomb gives it out to the
world that hjs fingernails and skin
dropped off with pnin excruciating during
his experiments with the rays, but wheu
he desisted both returned in due time,
and with an accompanying growth of huir
"unnsual and surprising."
The physicians of this City are not pre
pared at this time to give an opinion as
to the possible merits of Professor New
comb's alleged discovery; still they are
not inclined to doubt anything advanced
by so distinguished a professor.
It therefore leaves the bald-headed
men, who are most interested in the
weather, to sit and ponder whetner "it is
the same old gag."
Dou>; White, the best story-teller in this
City, not to talk of the State, never takÂ«s
his hat off when entertaining his friends.
He fears, somehow, that the luster of his
high forehead might add age to his anec
dotes. He is a siceptic on hair invigor
ators, whether they be scientific, natural
or otherwise. Some five years aÂ«o his
friend \V. J. Ritchie, now almost a mil
lionaire in London, discovered a wonder
ful spring in Southern California. Whi;e
was asked to interest himself in placing
the water before the public, as it was not
only a healthful beverage but it had a
wonderful power of restoring hair. A
man named Phil Montague was the local
agent, and he and White went to the
springe on a tour of inspection. With
him White had his little hairless Japan
ese dog, which tripped along merrily,
sniffing around the brush until a work
man yelled:
"The dog is in the creek !"
Sure enough, Fido came floating down
the stream and Montague rescued him
after having waded up to his knees in the
water.
Doug White was as excited as a mother
might have been over a similar predica
ment in which her child was the main
actor. He grasped Fido to himself and
nestled him closely unaer his warm coat.
A half hour later, when the dog ceased
shivering, he dropped him to romp on the
sward.
It was no more the Japanese hairless
dog, but an ugly Dewbiskered pup that
gamboled about, with long hairs like
those of King Charles drooping over his
eyes.
The little fellow jumped all around
While and sniffed at Him with a vim that
indicated he knew his master.
It may be sia'ed that White was un
aware that Montaeue had pinned a bit of
meat on his coattail and the hungry hair
covered Jap was after it.
Montague explained how beneficial the
Waters from the spring were if they could
grow hair on a dojr in a few minuter.
\V hite was dubious and as a master
stroke, he asked Montague to show him via
calves.
"You were in the creek after the dog;
let's see what effect the water has had
upon you."
"That's so," said Montague, as ho
raised the bottom of his trousers, and
there, sure enough, were Jong red hairs
plentiful enough lor a wig, but they were
damp and soaking, making tnem lose
much of their bushiness.
White says he thinks he was taken for a
good thing down south on that spring
water for Bald people, and he doesn't be
lieve in the Massachusetts genius.
While White is a skeptic, he is hopeful
thai science will so advance as to add to
his otherwise handsome head.
"And there are others."
Take Tom Shaw, for instance. He it is
whose friends are mostly found among
tbe railroad agents. There is a threaten
ing bald spot on t tie apex of a level head.
"I've been wasting Old Tom Gtu morn
ing and night on that one spot for nearly
five years." Tom stated yesterday. Then
he showed the piace, which looked like a
well swept tennis lawn.
George H. Sil! ol : San Jose, Joe Parker
of this City, HarrY Collins and a lot of
other prematurely bald are on the anxious
seat.
Police Judge Campbell takes a contrary
view of tne whole matter. He looks upon
the new discovery somewhat in the light
of a Delilah. His whiskers carried him
through to election in the last campaign
and he fears that next time others may by
trying the new remedy on their chin come
forth with an equally luxuriant growth.
The hairdressers of the City are not very
anxious. Since an authority on high art
has established a fad to have mansard
roofs made in Paris there has not been
innch demand for the like in this country;
hence there can be little lost.
UNDER ROLLING WHEELS.
A Switchman Seriously Injured by a
Train on .Kentucky Street.
John Flahiss, a switchman employed by
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
met with a serious accident at 5 o'clock
yesterday morning on the company's Ken
lucky-hireet track. It was Flahiss' duty
to open and close the switches on this line
as tlie yard engine passed and repassed
while sidetracKine and making up the
freight trains which go from the Long
bridge at the foot of Fourth street.
In performing h;s duties Flahiss was
thrown or fell under the wheels of a train,
and had his left leg badly crushed at the
knee joint. Policeman J. M. Lewis, who
was on duty in the vicinity, tel> phoned to
the Southern police station for the patrol
wagon, and tne unfortunate switchman
wa.-> taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where
the crushed and mangled limb was ampu
tated at the hip joint. Ihe physician who
attended him gave it as his opinion that
the injuries will prove fatal.

KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.
Rev. W. A. Gardner Declares
It Is the High Law of
Heaven.
He Ana'yz s It fjr the Benefit of His
Congregation in the West-Side
C urch.
The Rev. W. A. Gardner preached an
interesting sermon at the West Side
Christian Church. Bush street, near Devis
adero, last night, on "Kindness to Ani
mals." His audience was so large that
not a seat was vacant in the church and,
besides, many chairs were occupied in the
rear.
Mr. Gardner said that men are often
cruel to animals while kind to people
about them. The man who keeps the law
of kindness will be kind to children and
to beasts of all kinds that God has given
him dominion over. God has not given
man dominion over animals to do as one
pleases with them. There are cretain
rights which men have over animals, the
right to use them for food, for instance,
which is given by the Jaw ot Moses and of
Christ. He continued:
"Christ cooked ti.Â«h for his disciples, but
I don't think he cooked them as fish, are
cooked for you now."
Then the preacher narrated an instance
that came under his notice, where a
lobster was boile<l alive to give it a nice
red color. He also knew of a woman on
the plains who put live fish on the coals
and watched them squirm in their agony,
and then ate them.
"God has created scores of animals," he
said, "for us to domesticate for our own
uses. There are certain cirrum stances
where a horse may suffer righteously
for the benefit of man. I can con
ceive of a circumstance where a horse
may be ridden to death and not against
the law of kindnessâ :o save a human life.
"But the terrible driving and riding for
sport are evidence that the driver is under
the influence of Satan, and not only a
violator of the laws oT California, but of
the higher law of heaven. We do not
violate the great law of kindness when we
u<e animals for our legitimate purposes.
"I can see no violation of the law of
God in keeping pets in the family, yet
sometimes we violate the law of Christ
when vÂ« turn children over to the nurse
and let the dog take their place. When
the mother does to she 13 violating the
great law of kindness. If a man will
abuse animals he will sometimes
abuse his children. One of the things
God requires of us is to furnish animals
around us with good food aud with shel
ter.
"The great law of heaven, this law of
kindnofs, is higher than the law of
honesty, and tho man who is violating
that law is breaking that which is uigher
than the law, 'Thou shalt not steal.' I
believe it is right that animals should be
protected irom beintr wantonly and waste
fully destroyed. In this country to-day
thousands of birds are wantonly slaugh
tered for decorating women's hats. In
one year in Missouri 500,000 red birds were
ki.led for trimming of bats. They were
caught ia trans and skinned alive. God
has not created birds for that purpose. I
don't think women are cruel, but merely
forgetful and I hope that in luture some
of the ladies present will wear something
cisc in their hats."
An experienced farmer asserts that if
one-half of the fruit of a heavily laden
tree is removed by picking the remainder
will be ot" better quality. The product wilt
also be as many bushels as though all of
the fruit had remained on the trÂ«e.
