MOVING LIGHTS ONCE MORE
MYSTIFY THIS CITY.
Dr. Benjamin Disclaims the Invention â Mayor
Sutro's Testimony and That of Other
Reputable Citizens Offered.
.'. Testimony concerning the existence of an airship which is supposed to be navigat
ing the air over the bay cities by night and hiding from observation in some secluded
. .place before daybreak came in yesterday from many sources. Many persons saw
mysterious lights moving overhead. But the projectors of the phenomenon which
has caused intense and general interest seem to revel in mystery.
Among those who yesterday told of seeing the lights carried about by an aeria
visitor were Mayor Sutro. Colonel Menton, the excursion agent of the Southern Pacific
Company; Samuel Foliz, advertising manager of The Call; Professor C. H. Murphy
of the Polytechnic High School, also many others.
What they saw or heard from other 3 who saw the moving light is told in the sub
joined account. They all lell practically the same story, which is that the light ap
peared quite high overhead and that it moved very fast. They did not all observe it
to be moving in the same direction.
Dr. Benjamin, who has been supposed to have invented a flying machine or air
â¢â h!p, ir&ich la supposed to be tbe cause of the phenomena observed overhead during
th-e past few nights, was in the City yesterday, and last evening was interviewed by
The Call. Dr. Benjamin said that Le did not know anything about the airship. At
the same time he conceded that if he did know of such an invention of bis own, he
would consider it wise not to give any in ormation concerning it until he had secured
his patents. Dr. Benjamin said that Mr. Collins is his attorney, and admitted thnt
he visited Mr. Collins yesterday afternoon. This, in connection with the fact that Mr.
Collins admitted that he is attorney for a man who claims to have invented an air
ship, must be takeu for what it is worth.
Concerning this mystery it thould be clearly understood that The Call does not
aver that an airship has been invented, nor does it deny that such is the fact.
' There is no intention on the part of The Call to deceive its readers. The state
ments which have been made by reputable citizens are given, and these will un
â¢ doubtedly be carefully considered and the consensus of public opinion will place
jhe true value upon the different circumstances. There are several theories to ac
count for the mysterious moving light, which do not necessarily imply the existence
of a flying machine or airship.
There is no doubt that many people firmly believe in the airship. There were
many such who sat up late last night to watch for the appearance of such a vessel.
Many stood on roofs and in other elevated places, in the rain, until late, hoping to get
tt glimpse of it. At the hour of going to press the whole matter remained a mystery.
' Henry W. Bradley of the law firm of Stanly, Hayes A Bradley made a very inter
esting statement which will be widely read.
The most circumstantial story yet told rame from Oakland last night. Passengers
on a streetcar claim to have been attracted by the light overhead and looking upward
'Xhey saw distinctly the outlines of an airship, which resembled a huge bird in its out
. lines and which seemed to rise ana fall in its course. Many residents of Oakland say
that they, also, discerned the outlines of the vessel.
BODY LIKE A BIRD.
What Spectators Across the Bay
Say That They Saw.
â¢ â¢ OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 23.â There is a
general impression in this city that the
airship which has been seen so often re
cently is being housed somewhere in Ala
meda'County when it is not being tested
by ite inventor.
The whole population is about equally
engaged between discussing the qualities
of airships and looking at the sky expect
ing to see the winged machine parting the
<c.lo*uds Reports are continually being
received of its beta' seen in the neighbor
hood of Berkeley and Haywards, as though
the inventor were confining his experi
ments to the low land between the hills
. that skirt the northern boundary of the
county and the bay. Several people saw
..the light over Haywards last night, and
the number of people who have seen it in
North Oakland is constantly increasing.
Last evening the conductor wearing
badge No. 26 of the Alameda eiectric line
reported seeing the affair over Fruitvale.
He says it had a powerful headlight and
there appeared to be several smaller liehts
on board.
â¢Mayor Davie is a firm believer in the ex
istence of the airsnip. *'I doubted the
story of those who declared they had seen
it," said the Mayor to-day, "but when I
looked through the names of the rep
utable people who unhesitatingly assert
that they have seen it I doubt it no
longer.
"I have always believed in the practica
bility of airships, and a few years ago old
Dr. FreelinL' had a model that closely re-
sembled the picture published of this in
vention, and he told me before he died
. . teat when aluminum was broueh' into
use the secret of air-flying would be solved.
. I have no doubt that some one has built a
machine, because many of those who have
seen it are certainly entitled to credit."
IL Attorney A. A. Moore heard the story
; of the airship a few days ago. "I did not
talk with Mr. Collins," he said, "but I
was talking with a friend, an attorney,
who toid me that Collins had talked with
him about a client who had invented an
airship."
Last evening at about 7:80 o'clock the
passengers on an Alameda car were
Btartled by the sight of a brilliant stream
The San Francisco Call
of light high in the heavens off in the
direction of Haywards. The passengers
distinctly saw the outlines of an airship
and watched its maneuvers high in the
skies.
The ship resembles a huce bird in its
outlines and seemed to rise and fall in its
course. A light streamed from the head
of the ship, throwing a white stream of
light for several hundred yards. As the
outlines of the airship were plainly dis
cerned the passengers in the car became
greatly excited. The phenomenon bad first
been noted by a man who had been idly
watching the heavens. As soon as he per
ceived the light he attracted tue attention
of the other passengers and all intensely
interested watched the peculiar machine
as it made its way through the skies.
It was high in the heavens and ap
peared to be of huge size. When first
seen it seemed to be floating over San
Leandro. It moved rapidly, going at
least twenty miles an hour. It shot across
the skies in the northwest, then turned
quickly and disappeared in the direction
of Haywards. Not only was the airshiD
seen by the passengers, but many other
residents of tds city distinctiy saw the
brilliant light and the huge, bird-like body
floating in midair. None of the spectators
were acquainted with each other, and yet
their stories are startlingiy similar, agree
ing as to time, direction of the airship and
description. These facts leave little doubts
in the minds of many people that a suc
cessful airship has been invented, and is
navigating the heavens.
Mias Wilson, a daughter of Captain
Wilson of the police force, and her friend,
Miss Hunter, are among those who
viewed the strange sight. The two friends
accompanied another young lady to the
streetcar about 7 p. m. yesterday, where
their attention was attracted by the pecu
liar light in the skies. The huge bird
like body from which the light emanated
was clearly visible, and both youn? ladies
are. positive it was an airship. It followed
the same course as described by the pas
senger on the Alamedacar. Police Officer
Carson and John Striekler, the flagman at
Fourteenth and Broadway, also declare
.that they saw the airship.
"Tbe representatives of tbe alternoorij
papers were almost hysterical in their de
mands that I disc-edit The Call's inter
view. I wish to say right here that I have
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 24 1896.
IRVING M. SCOTTâ "An airship? Of course not. That's the last cruiser I bid for and lost.
I've been wondering ever since what became of it."
not a word to take back of all that has
been reported. It was a truthful, reliable
interview and The Call is ihe only paper
that has reported me correctly. The
stories in the evening papers that I had
denied the interview were false and the
writers actually told me that they were
going to write such stuff before they left
my office.
"Since the fact was published that lam
the attorney for the inventor I have not
seen my client. We ma led the papers re
yarding the patent to Washington last
week and expect to hear soon of their ar
rival. Ido not know when I shall see my
client again, but I expect him any day.
He is a man that impressed me with the
idea of being perfectly able to ma nage his
own affairs, and I have no doubt he Knows
what he is doing.
"I wish to correct one idea that seems
to be prevalent. Some papers have pub
lished the fact that the inventor is an
Oroville man. I have not said so. He is
a San Francisco man, but he has con
structed his machine near Oroville. I aid
say this afternoon to the reporters of the
San Francisco evening papers that the
story as published in the Chronicle was a
fake. Not only that; I told the young
fellow from the Chronicle that he had
grossly misrepresented me in his inter
view where he quoted me as having said
I saw the airship work, the inventor hav
ing come here, and, after talking to me
a while, getting into it and moving away.
The statement that I had seen it working
at all is false.
"As I told you before, as I told him, and
as I now repeat it, all I know is that I
have been appealed to by a man who ap
pears perfectly sound to act as his attorney
in securing for him a patent on his inven
tion. It would be presumptious for me to
say the Btory that an airship was being
worked about the bay was a fake, when it
is taken into consideration the number of
people who stake their reputation on
having seen one. Even if it was not the
ship of the man who came to see me, it is
not for me to say that these people have
not seen an airship. There is more than
one man at work on the question of aerial
navigation, and some one is bound to
solve it as they did the steam-engine and
the electric-car. lam as skeptical regard
ing the actual working of the craft as any
one, but am not such a fool as to say that
it is an impossibility.
"I was told in this city to-day that the
Chronicle had secured a man â one Dr.
Benjamin, I believe âto maintain
throughout that the invention is his and
that he is the one who has been going
about the heavens at night. He is to say
that he has paid me $500 as a retainer and
that I am to have $1500 when the patents
are issued. This is along the line of their
story as first told, and it must be kept up
at any cost. I desire to denounce the
whole story in advance as a pure fake to
support the wild imagination of one of
their reporters. It places me in an unfair
light before the public and injures my
business to have such stories set afloat
when there is not the least foundation for
them.
"When the Examiner man came to me
Sunday afternoon he told me that his
paper had the whole story and knew the
inventor and would publish it this morn
ing. They did not particularly care, he
said, for my version, but would like to
have it just to verify what they knew.
The bold biuff did not work and the story
in to-day's Examiner trying to ridicule
tbe affair, but at tbe same time leaving
loopholes to escape, was the result
"There is no denying the fact that the
public has been aroused to a hi h pitch of
expectation by the reports published. The
Examiner sent a man to me to-day who
said they bad treated the whole affair as a
huge joke, but found that tbe people were
looking at it in a serious manner and they
were ready to give the news as received,
regardless of how improbable it might
look. He asked me to give a true account
of the matter as far as I knew anything,
but when I denied having seen the ma
chine work or naving ridden in it he
laughed and said I was hedging."
KNEW OF THE AIRSHIP.
Attorney H. W. Bradley Was In-
formed of Interesting Facts.
"I am at a loss to know how you
could have ascertained that I know any
thing about the airship," said Henry W.
Bradley of the law firm of Stanley, Have
j & Bradley, of this City, yesterday, to a
i representative of The Call
"Do you know anything about it?"
Mr. Bradley hesitated a moment, then
said: "The man you want to see is
George A. Collins, the attorney. All I
can say is that if Collins said what is
accredited to him in a published interview
this morning, Collins knows what he is
talking about, and I will say, further, tbat
Collins would scarcely take part in a fake
story, because he would have more to lose
than to gain by so doing.
'â¢Now, there is that first publication in
The Call about ( hÂ« airshir. That vn
doubtedly was sent by telegraph from Sac
ramento after 1 o'clock in the morning, for
it states it was after midnight that the
object was seen over tbat ctty. Then there
is McGovern at t!:e California Hotel, who
told me Saturday night that be saw it
between 2 and 4 o'clock in the morning.
I know tbat it landed at 3 o'clockâ
"Where?"
"You have made me say more than I
intended to," replied Mr. Bradley, with a
look uj on his countenance which seemed
to say that he wished he had remained
silent; then as a faint smile lighted up his
features: "I cannot tell you where it
landed; that is, I do not feel at liberty to
state where. The man you want to see is
Collins.
"You must understand that I cannot
speak about this matter, but will say this:
The Call has been consistent in this mat
ter. It is on the right track and it must
not back water; and then it got ahead of
all the other papers on a big piece of
news.
"Then there is A. L. Hart of Sacra
mento, who stated that if certain parties
of that city declared that they had seen
the object he believed what they said."
"Where is that wonderful and much
talked-about airship now?" was asked.
"That I cannot tell you, but I will say
this: I was to have inspected it to-day,
but for some reason the invitation I ex
pected did not reach me; possibly be
cause tbe premature announcement in
The Call has interfered with projected
plans, or it may be the weather.
"I wish to place myself right in this
matter. While in conversation with a
gentleman three or four days before the
first publication of the airship story in
The Call I was told that such an inven
tion was In existence and the difficulty of
navigating the sky would soon be over
come. The gentleman who gave me this
information did so in confidence, a con
fidence that I will not betray. As an at
torney I could not afford to do so and as a
man I would not.
'There is another reason I have for not
wishing to give expression to my Knowl
edge or views, which is this: Several of
the newspapers have published interviews
with Mr. Collins and other papers have
asserted that he denied the truth of the
statements attributed to him. Now, it
would not look well for me to make state
ments contradictory to his or have him
deny statements that I made. Therefore,
I will keep silent."
Mr. Bradley stated that be is in no way
connected with the airship ccheme, either
as an attorney or as a friend to the parties
most concerned.
"Do you believe that the existence of an
airship at the present time is possible?"
was asked.
Mr. Bradley smiled and cautiously an
swered: "Was the airship not seen by hun
dreds of respectable citizens in Sacra
mento. San Francisco, Oakland and other
places? I would not presume to dispute
their statements."
"Then you believe that we have such an
invention that has proved a success?"
DEATH OF ITALO CAMPANINI, THE GREAT TENOR.
ROME, Italy. Nov. 23.â 1ta10 Campanini, the singer, who was known in the
[United States, died at Parma to-day.
Italo Campanini was born in Parma in 1846. He enlisted in the army of Garibaldi
when 14 yeats old, and took part in the fight before Milazzo. Having discovered dur
ine the campaign that he had a wonderful voice he studied singing for two years at
the Conservatory of Parma, and made his first appearance as tbe notary in "La
Sonnambula," at his native town. In 1869 he went 10 Milan and placed himself
under the tuition of the celebrated teacher Francesco Lamperti. In 1872 he made his
London debut as Oenaro in "Lucrezia Borg.a," and in 1873 sang with Christiue
Nilsson in New York. He returned to America during the season of 1879-80. Besides
being the greatest tenor living at that time he was remarkable for the immense scope
of his repenoire, which included nearly eighty operas, the tenor role* of which he
could sine at a few hours' notice.
"Yes. I believe what my friends tell
me. However, I am not an authority. All
I know, that is, all 1 think I know, is from
hearsay testimony, and I do not intend
to commit myself upon hearsay testimony
alone. I have never seen it, and Ido not
expect to make a trip in it as it has been
reported."
SEEN LAST NIGHT.
Many Persons In This City Gazed
Upward and Wondered.
The mysterious light was seen last night
in this City by a gentleman of undoubted
practical experience. Samuel Foltz, ad
vertising manager of The Call, was look
i.'il. oat irorn his residence at 1157 fctanyan
street about 9:15 p. m., wben he noticed a
light traveling in the direction of Berke
ley. He at first thought he was dreaming,
but looking again he called out the people
residing in tbe house and all agreed that
the light corresponded in appearance with
that attiibuted to the mysterious flying
ship.
Mr. Foltz said that the light was appa
rently that of an ordinary lamp; that it
was located about 300 feet above the earth,
and was, when sighted, above the locality
of Van Ness avenue, and that it was trav
eling direct and with tremendous velocity
toward Berkeley. Tbe light remained in
sight about four minutes, when it passed
out of view.
C. H. Murphy, a teacher at the Poly
technic High School, told an interesting
story last evening: "I was coming down
Valencia street about 9:15 to-night," said
Mr. Murphy, "and I noticed the phe
nomenon. Above, at an elevation of possi
bly 4000 feet, was an electric glow, which
was moving toward the park at the rate of
one mile per minute. This was observed
by hundreds of pers6ns. Every one on
Valencia street might have seen it. There
was only one light. This had a vibration
or wave. There was no fake about this.
When I saw the light I was on the south
side of Valencia street."
OVER SUTRO HEIGHTS.
Airship Scan by the Mayor's Em
ployes a Few Days Ago.
None of those who have seen the mys
terious moving lights in the heavens that
are believed to be those of an airship is
more firmly convinced that a flying ma
chine hovers nightly over the bay cities
than Mayor Sutro, and the story he tells
to support his expressed belief is vastly
interesting.
The Mayor is nothing if not practical,
and he says that there is not the faintest
doubt in his mind that the aerial courser
passed over Sutro Heights a short time
ago and that it was a genuine airship and
doing a very fair job of air-sailinfe.
"I have not seen the ship myself," said
the Mayor after the meeting of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday, "but some of
my people at the heights have, and their
stories leave no doubt in my mind as to
the truth of the stories The Call has pub
lished on the subject
"Their narratives were not given me
after the paper got hold of the matter, but
were told several days ago when no such
thing had reached public print.
"When I reached home one evening,
about the length of time ago I mention, I
found them in a great state of excitement,
and wben I inquired the reason of tbe
agitation they told me of a strange spec
tacle they had witnessed a short time be
fore. They told me that shortly after
dark they had seen a strange, brilliant
light coming in from the direction of the
sea.
"At first little attention was paid to it,
but as the light drew nearer all became
very much interested and watched the
brilliant spot closely.
"As it approached tbe heights they saw
that it was not over 500 feet al-ove the
ocean and was movin swiftly and with a
slightly undulating motion.
"When almost over the beach two lights
were discernible, one apparently being be
low a misty-looking mass and the other
behind it.
"They paid particular attention to the
latter, as it threw a long ray of light,
similar to that cast by a searchlight, far
out into the darkness. They told me that
this stream of Light was 500 f >-et long, but
I presume that, while it seemed that long,
it was in rea.ity much shorter.
"They wa tched it until it disappeared
in the direction of the City and saw it
turn toward tne north just before it passed
from view. Now, these people would not
try to tell me ghost stories, and I know
that they saw just what they described.
"I certainly think that some shrewd
inventor has solved the problem of aerial
navigation and that we will hear all about
it within a short time. It would not be
any more wonderful than the invention
of the telegraph, the telephone, the phono
graph or the X ray, and it would seem
that some one must hit on the proper
appliances when so many smart men have
been working on the problem."
It has been stated that the airship
passed over the Seal Rocks a short time
ago and played its light on the seals, and
it may be that this was the occasion when
it was seen from the heights.
COLONEL MENTON SAW IT.
Three Lights in View as the Mys-
tery Sailed.
Colonel W. H. Menton, the excursion
agent of the Southern Pacific Company,
lives in the Supreme Court building at the
corner of. Larkin and McAllister streets.
He is confidnt he saw the mysterious
aerial peregrinator Sunday nignt This is
his story as he told it yesterday:
"Last night, at about 20 minutes of
8 o'clock, the elevator-boy came to my
door and told me if I wanted to see the
airship to go to the window. My wife and
two lady friends went at once to the win
dow, and looking out toward the park, say
at an apparent height of about 100 yards,
saw three lights. One shot its rays toward
the northwest, another toward the south
west, and one, the most brilliant, poured
Its light directly toward the earth. These
lights had the appearance and intensity
of searc i lights.
"I am sure," continued Colonel Men
ton, "that it was neither a star, meteor
nor any other wanderer of the heavens.
The light was far brighter than any of
the electric lights I saw just below, in and
about the park.
"It was traveling toward the west, and
we saw it distinctly for ten or fifteen min
utes. We all gazed at it until it disap
peared in the distance. It neither rose
nor fell, but maintained an even course
parallel with the earth."
CROSSED THE GATE.
And Some Time Later Was Seen
Over the Twin Peaks.
M. H. Cohen of 510 Baker street, a con
ductor on the Hayes-street car line, saw
an object in the sky at 7:05 last Sunday
evening, which he believes was the airship.'
The object seemed to be 300 or 400 feet
above the earth. Speaking of the sight
yesterday he said: "I first saw it at Mar
ket and Eighth streets. It seemed to be
moving across the Golden Gate and a
flash was occasionally displayed. I called
the gripman's attention to it, and he
looked and said, "It might be the airship."
Two gentlemen on the rear end of the car
saw it I told the receiver and the night
watchman about what I bad seen. The
car left the ferry at 7:13 o'clock, and at
First street I saw the object again directly
over the Twin Peaks. Tne forward light
seemed to be steady. I informed i*'rank
Allen, the machinist at the cai house, and
he remarked that he had seen a similar
object and called the attention of two
ladies to it.
"I did not see the object again until I
got to the top of P:erce-street hill. Then
it seemed to be coming back again from
Twin Peaks. "We left the park at 7:51,
and looting back from Ashbury street pot

downward for a few minutes. Tte night

HEAVY SEAS.
Stories of Awful Saff ring Told by
Those Who Escaped With
Their Lives
POINT ARENA, Cal., Nov. 23â Thirty
one survivors oi the San Benito ditaster
were tafcen from the wrecked steamship
at 7 o'clock this morning by re-cuers sent
in boats from the steamship Point Arena.
Since 1 o'clock yesterday morning some
had been hanging to the wave-swept rig
ging ami others tenanting a small apart
ment in the hold, which each high sea
almost filled with water. Tbe men were
benumbed and exhausted, and a half
dozen of them had decided to plunge into
the sea and make a last attempt to reach
shore when the boat from the Point Arena
stood in and they saw rescue at hand. It
is now certain that only six of the crew
were lost They were:
O. W. SCOTT, first assistant engineer.
C. COX DON, second assistant en*
gineer.
I. W. WILSON, chief cook.
JCHXSHEE. AN, forward meiimsn.
CHARLES BROWN, coal passer.
NICHOLAS FITZGERALD, coal
passer.
Those who reached shore \ from the
wreck by swimming, or on. the , boat that
capsized when near the beach, were: ; F.
Â£. Foster, quartermaster; Charles Janson,
seaman ; - Harry -\ Jackson, donkey man;
Harry, _ Faehn. â  seaman f George
Christopher,, fireman, and Â Narciso
Lyva, , coalpasser. The rest of the
crew are aboard j the Point Arena, which
steamed . for Eureka after taking them
aboard.,:. _ ; ,
The San Benito lies as it did yesterday,
the forward half about 100 feet from the
balance of the vessel. Much of the pro
visions and canned goods in the store
rooms can be saved if the divided nail is
not pounded to pieces by the seas.
All night long efforts had been made to
rescue the men from the wrecked steam
ship. At midnight men were sent to the
town of Point Arena to make some bolts
to be shot from the steamship Weott's
gun. Unfortunately the steamer sent only
one bullet with the gun and on the first
trial the line was too tight and it broke.
It was nearly morning when the men
from town returned with bolts and a new
line. Meanwhile those on tbe beach hart
made two large kites and had them flying
over the wreck when it was light enough
to see her; but at this time the boa.s from
the Point Arena and Weott bad reached
tbe San Benito and soon every man on the
wreck was rescued.
A mighty shout went up from the shore.
The men yelled and danced for joy and
the women, many of whom had patiently
witched on the beach all night in the rain
and cold, cried and laughed alternately.
The whole country was soon notified of
the rescue, messengers starting for town
as fast as horses could run to carry the
glad tidings.
The six men who reached shore yester
day tell substantially the same story.
Harry Faehn, the last man who was
washed overboard and pulled out of the
breakers exhausted, and who required the
doctor' 3 attention for two hours before
consciousness was restored, is still in a
critical condition. A Call correspondent
found him at tne house of Thomas Ken
ney, who lives near the scene of the disas
ter, whither laeun was taken as soon as
he could be moved. He is still dazed and
believes he is on the wreck, and the doctor
is afraid he will not survive.
Harry Jackson, donkey man, and Charles
Janson, seaman, say that it began blowing
a gale Saturday afternoon, with a heavy
shower of rain, and at times nothing
could be seen a ship's length awcy. The
deck was washed by the waves every few
minutes, so that the lookout had to stand
on the bridge for fear of beiug washed
overboard.
After dark Saturday night no lights of
any kind were seen, and as the ship was
being worked by dead runninc the log
showed that she was or should be four
miles off and below the Point Arena light
house. A few minutes past 1 o'clock
breakers were seen dead ahead, and, al
though going very slowly, before she could
be stopped or her course changed the San
Benito ran bow on the beach and
stuck fast.
The heavy sea broke over her every mo
ment, and each wave lifted her stern high
and brought it down with a thump that
shook her from end to end. Soon the ves
sel broke in two just aft the smokestack
and the stern parted and went back on
the beach about fifty feet south of the for
ward part, which stuck fast.
As soon as she struck the whistle was
blown for any assistance that might be at
hand. The whistle was kept gome until
she broke in two. When the vessel
crashed into shore both the forward and
after port boats were wrenched from their
davits and crushed. The forward star
board boat, with First Assistant Engineer
Charles Jansen and three others in it, was
sent away to attempt a landing and get
assistance.
It was capsized in an instant, and the
crew left struggling in the angry waves.
Jansen and one other reached the beach2
after a hard struggle, where they lay for
some time unable to move.
Tbe after starboard boat was then
launched, with Second Assistant Engi
neer Harry Jackson and two others in it.
Before it had gone twenty feet it was
thrown over several times and the crew
hurled out. Jackson says it was capsized
nine times before be got loose from it.
Three men managed to reach tbe shore,
and found the others on the beach. Then
they started for assistance.
T. E. Foster, who was acting quarter
master, and was at the wheel, says it bad
been blowing a gale all Saturday after
noon, and the sky became totally obscured
when nigbt came on, and the rain fell in
sheets. No lights were seen in any direc
tion> He had just besn given orders to
change the course one ana a half points
as usual after passing the Point Arena
Ught
Soon after "Breakers ahead !" was
shouted by tbe lookout and the wheel
was put hard over and tbe bell rung to
back the engines at full speed, but in an
instant she struck, head on. The waves
were high and breaking continually, so
that it looked, when they could be seen,
as though the ship was going right into
the breakers all the time.
As soon as the San Benito struck, he
Bays, tbe whistle was blown continuously,
until she broke in two and the steam
pipes were broken. The sea was breaking
over her constantly, and all hands got
into the rigging forward as soon as possi
ble. The men in the rigging expected
every moment to be thrown into the
seething sea, as the masts toppled and
snapped and seemed to be going by the
board witn each sea.
Those of the crew who had turned in
rushed on deck when the crash came
without waiting to put on any of their
clothing, and they were compelled to
I ass twenty-eight hours in that condition.
No personal effects were saved, out it is
believed that the wrecker Whiteiaw saved
all the papers, instruments and most of
the valuables in the cabins not dam
aged by water, as that part of the wreck
â was least exposed after breaking and
drifting around on the beach.
Owing to the darkness while launching
the boats the survivors who got ashore
made some mistakes in the names of men
who got into the boats. Michael Pende
gast did not start, but remained on the
wreck and was taken off by the steamer
Point Benito's boat.
None of the bodies of the drowned have
been recovered, and it wi;l be some time
before they will float, as the thin clothes
covering them are undoubtedly filled with
t-and. Some may never come ashore. It
it said one body was seen floating two
miles north of the wreck to-night.
Tne gallant captains and crews of both
the Point Arena and the Weott cannot be
too highly praised, and ail those who
risked their lives in the glorious work of
trying to succor their suffering brethren
deserve great reward. Those who watched
on the beach and saw everything say they
would not again experience the awful
suspense for any sum of money.
The wrecking steamer Whiteiaw was at
the wreck this afternoon and took a few
valuaole articles that were in danger of
being lost, but at 5 p. m. she suddenly
whistled for her boats and disappeared in
the heavy rain that came up suddenly.
The lifeboat belonging to the San Benito
was taken by some of the ranchers to-day,
and they went on a foraging expedition.
Although the sea was very smooth they
managed to capsize the boat twice and had
a narrow escape from drowning.
They finally reached tne wreck and re
ported the storeroom full of valuable pro
visions and canned goods which could be
saved; but, tbe steamer Whiteiaw coming
up, they got ashore as quickly as possible.
No communication could be had with the
wrecking steamer, so her intentions can
not be learned. If the weather continues
good her machinery, anchors and chains
will be removed.
SURVIVORS BEACH MENDOCINO
Story of the Disaster Told by the Rescued
Seamen,
MENDOCINO, Cal.. Inov. 23. â The
steamship Point Arena arrived here this
afternoon, having on board the survivors
of the Ban Eenito disaster. After inde
scribable suffering these menâ thirty-one
In number â were rescued from the doomed
vessel when the sea had calmed down
sufficiently during the forenoon. They
ate nearly worn out from exhaustion, but
here they have been given comfortable
quarters and are in a happy state of mind
Because their troubles are at an end.
Those who were taken from the San
Benito this morning are: Captain \V.
Smith; Richard Zolling, first officer;
James Swan, second officer; Charles Bile,
third officer; W. Wood, cnief engineer;
Peter Cleary, third assistant engineer;
Gus Johnson, quartermaster; F. Nelson,
carpenter; James W. Stewart, seaman;
Nicole Nelson, seaman; John Benson, sea
man; J. A. Barclay, seaman; O. Simmons,
seaman; Arthur Wnite, seaman; John
Jt'erry, lamp-trimmer; William Sloan, en
gineers' storekeeper; James J. Riley, fire
man; James Keboe, fireman; James Me-
Daid, fireman; Barney Fahey, fireman;
Edward Fahey. fireman; M. Pendergast,
fireman; William Sheehan, coalpasser;
Manuel Fernandez, coalpasser; Michael
KeHy, coalpasser; W. H. Jeffs, water
tender; John Keen, water-tender; James
Ward, water-tender; John J. Wilson,
second cook* C. Meyers, saloon man;
Frank Dean, messboy.
Six more of the survivors are at Point
Arena. Captain Smith, worn out with
hardships and sad at heart over the loss
of his ship and men, declined to give any
details, and beyond giving the names of a
few men who left tne Ban Benito, either in
the boat that got off or by swimming, he
made no statement. Martin Kelly of the
engineeps department gives the following
accyunt of the disaster:
The San Benito struck about 1:15
in the morning and broke in two in
twenty minutes, parting through the en
gine-room. The bow of the ship was
thrown northeast toward the shore and
the stern lay due east, about fifty yards
distant. When the ship struck the two
port boats swung out seaward. A terrible
sea was running and as the ship swung
around these boats were rendered useless.
The men went to the lee side toward the
shore and launched the forward boat.
Captain Smith asked the mate what he
thought about getting into the boat and
the mate replied:
"We don't know where we are."
The mate said, further, that he thought
there were rocks all around them, as the
surf was breaking high on all sides, and
be advised everybody to stand by the
ship. Probably some did embark in this
boat, bnt because of the confusion that
followed Mr. Kelly does not know to a cer
tainty.
Just at this moment there was an awful
crashing of timbers and the mate called to
the crew to look out for falling masts.
The masts, however, stood intact, but the
gallant ship broke in two pieces. As soon
as the forward part of the ship became so
placed that the men could do anything
they launched starboard boat number two.
The captain said to his men, "We might
as well stick by the ship." He advised all
tj stay on tiie yesÂ»el, bat allowed those
who thought it tended to their safety to
go in the boat. He told them they could
not get to the shore through the break
ers, and advised them to keep out to sea.
In this boat went O. W. Scott, first as
sistant engineer; C. Condon, second as
sistant engineer; H.Jackson, fireman ; N.
F. Fitzgerald, N. Ly va ana C. Brown, coal
passers; F. Fuster and C. Jansen, seamen,
and J. Shreran, messnian.
It was very daik ar.d hazy and after the
boat pushed off it was not seen again by
those left on the wreck, but later it wa&
learned that four of these men reached
the suore.
Of those who left the ship some time
after this boatload, George Christopher
swam to the shore and was saved. I. W.
Wilson tried to swim to the shore, but the
ebbing tide carried him out to sea and he
was drowned. H. Feben was washed off
tbe ship, and although unable to swim
was thrown up on the shore and saved.
After the boatload of men left tha ship
the remaining men and officers took to the
foremast rigging, and stayed there until
they were rescued. Even after the sea
had become somewhat calmer, the waves
still dashed over the deck. The only ones
who were not in the rigging were Third
Assistant Engineer Peter Clary, Chief
Cook I. W. Wilson, J. J. Wilson, second
cook, and three or four others. They
went under the gallant forecastle head,
aud locked themselves in to keep out the
waves that swept over the helpless wreck.
At 2:45 o'clock a cry was heard from
the shore, and the crew, rejoicing in the
safety of their comrades, responded witti a
cheer. Thpy felt sure it was some one
from the ship, as up to this time they had
neither seen nor heard anything on
shore, although as long as the engine
would work a constant whistling had
been kept up. Soon after this fires were
built on the shore and they could Bee
people moving about. Had there been a
life-saving service or a rocket-gun at the
lighthouse it would cave been easy to
have sent a rope to the wet and freezing
men hanging in tbe rigging and all
might then have reached the shore in
safety. No effort, as far as the men on the
wreck knew, was made to save them by
the people on shore, and they remained
in their terrible position until the steamer
Point Arena's boat arrived at 6:45 o'clock
this morning.
The men from the unfortunate San
Benito cannot praise the Point Arena's
captain and his gallant crew enough for
their humanity and skiii. As soon as
possible a boat was sent to them and six
men were carried to the deck of the Point
Arena. The boat returned, but the tre
mendous seas nearly carried it onto the
deck of the wreck, and with difhculty the
crew saved their craft from being stove in.
Reluctantly they went back to their own
vessel and waited for a chance to aid the
shivering men, over whom the spray con
stantly fell.
The Point Arena stayed by the wreck,
and at 6:45 o'clock this morning, when the
sea had grown calmer, the men were taken
from the rigging and landed on board the
steamship. Then they looked back upon
the terrors and sufferings of the iast
twenty-nine hour*. They had not fled to
the rigging without making a gallant
attempt to help themselves. As soon as
the ship parted they threw hatches into
the sea with ropea attached, hoping they
would drift to the shore and afford them
the means of saving themselves. These
hatches, however, were carried out to sea.
Martin Kelly put on tj life-preserver
with a line attached and tried to swim
ashore, but the tide set off shore and the
line was heavy and he soon returned to
the ship and was drawn to the deck. After
that they waited for help or death, more
in expectation of the latter than the
former. While in the rigging they had
no food until 10 o'clock last nigbt, and
only a quart bottle of water that Kelly di
vided with his suffering shipmates.
About 10 o'clock it became calm rnough
so that the carpenter could cut through
the deck into the storeroom and get some
crackers, cheese and canned goods, which
he and some of the men who were least
benumbed aud chilled passed to the men
in the rigging.
Captain Strand of tbe Point Arena.when
he found a boat could not reach the San
Benito, sent a boat to the lighthouse with
the Point Arena's lifeline and rocket-gun.
These were hauled to a point opposite the
wreck and the lifeline was thrown by the
gun toward the wreck, but it fell short.
The second time the line broke and the
weight whirled over the unfortunate men.
Fireman Ehiun said the ship struck at
about 1:30 o'clock. He was in the fire
room- at the time. When she struck he
called out to liis comrades and then
climbed for the deck. Tne engineer blew
the whistle repeatedly for assistance,
but none came, and there were no signs
that any one on sUore, at tne lighthouse
or anywhere else paid any attention to
their signals of distress. Of course this
may not have been the case, but in the
darkness tbe men couid not learn whether
or not assistance was near.
CAPTAIN SMITH'S PREMONITION
Bad a Presentiment of JHtanter to the
San Benito.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 23.â Captain
Smith of the unfortunate San Benito had
a strong presentiment that his ship would
be wrecked this winter, and, further, that
she would split in two, just as she after
ward did. He has numerous friends at
the City Hall here, and always called on
them on tbe occasion of his semi-monthly
visits. One of these is Chief Clerk Jackson
of tbe Controller's office, who said to
day:
"I know Captain Smith had a dread of
just what happened to him, and not once
but on numerous occasions bas he talked
of having a feeling of disquiet and fear of
bis vessel being wrecked. Smith on bis
last trip was especially impressed by the
premonition that something was about to
happen to his vessel. I don't suppose he
talked in public as be would to us, who
were his friends, but the day before he
left be sat with us the greater part of the
afternoon, and during that time often
made reference to his queer feeling that
bis run would soon be ended in the wreck
ing of his Vesiel.
"The truth is that he feared the San
Benito. He explained to me that she
was long and slender; that when her
ordinary winter cargo of coal was on board
she was really dangerous. He said that
about 4500 tons of coal would be put on
board, divided into two lots, one at each
end of the vessel, leaving nothing but the
weight of her machinery to balance the
ship. He feared that in rough weather
she would begin pounding on tbe waves
up and aown, and that the sheer weight in
the ends of tne vessel would simply break
her in two and the ship and crew would go
to the bottom.
"While here he also hinted that he was
arranging to give up seagoing and get into
something else for a livelihood. He bas
long had a feeling of impending danger,
but it was especially noticeable last week.
While he never flinched his duty, I am
sure he often left here with anxious mis
givings. When the Keweenah was sup
posed to have foundered Captain Smitb
remarked that sooner or later his ship
would meet with a similar faie."

FRANK P. SLAVIN'S
CAREER CLOSED
Beaten by a Negro Boxer,
Who Is by No Means
a Star.
Bob Armstrong of Chicago Has
the Australian at His
Mercy.
After Baiag Sent to Ground Several
Times Slavin Giv.s Up in the
Fourth Round.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 25.-Frank
P. Slavin of Australia wound up his
career of defeat in this city by quitting in
tbe fourth round of his battle with Bob
Armstrong of Chicago belore tbe Park
Athletic Club to-night. Armstrong was
by no means a star, and if Slavin had
been a good second-rater he could have
disposed of the colored pug. The Austra
li n has seen his best days and was by no
means entitled to make the demand he
did before he went. Having signed for a
percentage, be was dissatisfied with the
house and endeavored to back out.
Hugh McWinters of this city and Andy
Watson of Boston, both colored, boxed ten
rounds at 135 pounds in the opening bout.
McWinters won.
Patsey Broderick of Providence and
Jack Madden of Brooklyn were tbe next
pair. They went ten rounds at 160 pounds
and were evenly matched during the first
six, but in the seventh and eighth rounds
Broderick cut loose and punched his man
bard. They mixed things up at short
range in the ninth and the honors were
even. In the tenth boih landed hard
lefts, but Broderick wus a bit stronger
when the bell rang. The referee decided
tbe bout a draw.
Rumors of a disagreement about the
principal "go" then grew rife. It ap
peared that Slavin and Armstrong bad
signed articles to box for a percentage,
but that Slavin was not satisfied with the
size of the house and flatly refused to go
on. Armstrong expressed himself as
ready to box. Afterward some of the Aus
tralian's friends induced him to stick to
his agreement, and he entered the ring at
11:15, where Armstrong had been waiting
for him nearly fifteen minutes. They
shook hands at 11 :2 Q. Armstrong weighed
185 ana Slavin 118 pounds. Sam C. Mus
lin was referee.
Round one â After a moment's sparring
Slavin led with the left, but was stopped
and countered on the mouth. Every time
Slavin tried to land he was stopped by
Armstrong's left. Tbe colored man put
a right on the body and left on the neck,
and sent his man to tbe floor with a right
on the neck. Armstrong punched tbe
Australian right and left and bad him
against the ropes when the bell rang.
Round two â Armstrong shot his long
left to the jaw and easily avoided Frank's
awkward rushes. Armstrong rushed and
had Slavin against the ropes punching
him, while the referee seemed unable to
break the men. At last, having tired of
ti.e hammer and tongs fight, tbey broke
away, ana Slavin landed on Armstrong's
j^w. Both were in distress when the ball
rang.
Round three â SJavin rushed, but got
one on the neck from Armstrong's right.
B>avin was groggy, but foutcht back
gamely. Armstrong swung right and
left on the jaw, and Frame clinched to
save himself. Slayin then came in with a
couple of hard rights on the neck and
jaw, and Armstrong was groggy when the
bell rang.
Round fourâ Armstrone opened with a
left on the nose, bringing blood. Slavin
got in a hÂ»rd body blow, but a left on tbe
neck sent him 10 the flocr. He got up
and shoved his left three times on the ne
gro's wind. Armstrong then landed
some terrific punches and Slavin threw up
bis bands and quit after 2 minutes and 56
seconds.
ALL PRINCETON CELEBRATES.
Oreat Jnv Vrer the limning of the
JJouble Championship.
PRINCETON, N. J., Nov. 23. â All
Princeton was out to-mghtand ceiebratine
in earnest. A baseball championship and
a football championship both in the same
year has filled the undergraduates with
enthusiasm, and every one from tbe green
est freshman to tbe gravest sophomore
felt himself in duty bound to-night to
make as much noise as possible in honor
of the occasion.
Early in tbe afternoon tbe bulletin
board bore tbe notice, "Everybody get
wood," and it was not long before the first
load of boxes ana barrels arrived at the
old cannon. As soon as it became dusk i
whole sections of fences, together witn I
ash-boxes and other property which it was
not convenient to get in broad daylight
began to come in. By 8 o'clock the pile .
bad assumed mammoth proportions, be
intf over fifty feet in diameter and nearly
as high.
At about this time pandemonium broke
loose. The bell in the "Old North Tower"
was kept constantly rinsing, and shot- {
guns, revolvers and firecrackers added to !
toe medley, while lrom the region of the
new library building came the surill notes
of the gleam whistles ou the hoisting
engines,
A brass band then came on the campus
playing the "Triangle Song," and the re
irain was caught up by over 1000 voices.
All the students formed, in line and
marched about the town, fifty of them
drawing a coach decorated in orange and
black in which were the victorious tiger
footbail team, ihe champions of '96. At
exactly 9 o'clock Captain Garrett Cochran
applied the match to the big pile of wood,
and in a few seconds names shot up to a
dMance of nearly 150 feet.
So intense was the heat that it set on
fire the trees surrounding the quadrangle,
making it necessary to turn the hose on
them. When tbe fire burned the students
gathered about the steps of the Clio Hall
and each member of tbe team was dragged
to the front and cheered heartily, and
each one spoke a few words telling how
Yale was defeated on Saturday. Alex
ander Moffatt, Frank Moore and Scotty
McM&fiters also spoke, and all declared
that Yale must be beaten again in 1897.
The hilarity continued late into the night,
and the undergraduates worked off ineir
exuberance of joy by dancing about the
glowing heap as long as it continued to
blaze.

BENJAMIN TALKS.
Is Inconsistent, but Refuses to
Father the Invention.
Dr. E. H. Benjamin, the man who
has either by chance or for a pur
pose been suggested as the inventor of the
airship, was seen at 633 Ellis street last
night by a Call reporter. Hu had retired
and was asleep, but arose, partly dressed,
and cordially invited bis late vis. tor into
bis room, a large single bedchamber at the
front of the boarding-house and with a
bay-window overlooking Eliis street. Dr.
Benjamin is a sinewy built man above the
average height, and with a large mustache
and brown hair and gray eyes.
He frankly denied having any connec
tion with or personal knowledge of an
airship, but his avowals of willingness to
impart the information were it his to give
were not consistent with hi 3 acknowledg
ments tnat a man with so very valuable
an invention, not completely perfected
and not yet securely patentable, would be
justified in lying in a straightforward
manner in order to divert from himself all
attention that might result in his being
persistently followed and the whereabouts
and desigu ot the Hying device made
known.
During a long conversation he said in
part:
"I am a dentist and have been for
twelve years. I am 34 years old and a
bachelor. 1 have a married uncie in
Placerville; his name is F. W. Benjamin
and he is a practicing physician of some
means. George Collins is my attorney,
for I have known George for a long time
and whatever little law business I have
wanted done I have had him do it. I Â»aw
him to-day and he laughed heartily when
I told him that they had me the inventor
of the airship. He is a shrewd fellow.
Well, I only wish I was the inventor.
But I am inclined to think I would be
afraid to go up in it.
"It is true that I am an inventor, but
along other lines. My inventions have to
do with dentistry, and consist in patented
crowns and bridges for teeth and a re
dacer to draw the gold bars in making
gold caps without seams. Then I have a
number of other little dental inventions.
Since my name appeared this moraing in
connection with this affair my friends
have joshed me a good deal about being
the inventor, and I have told some of
them that they may have a ride with me
to-morrow if the night is favorable. I
have given some thought to the possi
bility of inventing an airship.
"I firmly believe that there is an air
ship somewhere near here, and that it will
not be long before the public sees it, for as
yet, as I understand the newspaper ac
counts, no one has really got a good
view of an airship so much as of a bril
liant, moving searchlight. I expect to be

followed for a while and given a warm re
ception until people are convinced that I
am not the man they are looking for."
HE IS WELL KNOWN.
The Alleged Inventor Recently
Visited In the Interior.
Dispatches were received last night from
Woodland and Oroville concerning Dr.
Benjamin. The list of towns claiming
him while he has been supposed to be the
inventor of an airship is lengthening, like
the list of towns that claimed Homer.
A Woodland dispatch claimed that Dr.
Benjamin visited Woodland first about
eight years ago, when he was traveling
for Sherman & Clay.
He became acquainted with Dr. L. B.
Holmes and many others, and treated pa
tients in the office of Dr. Holmes, who con
sidered him a proficient workman. He
has not been in Woodland for about a year
and a half. He tdd some friends that he
would soon complete an invention that
would revolutionize the world. The fact
that he has a wealthy uncle in Orovilie
probably gave rise to the rumor that an
Oroville millionaire had built the airship.
A dispatch from Oroville alleges that
Dr. Benjamin in a native of Carmei, Me.
He was in Oroville November 15 visiting
his uncle.
READY TO SAIL IN AIR.
Court Judges Asking for Passes
and Others Seeking: Positions.
George D. Collins, who claims to be the
attorney for the inventor of the airsbip,
has evidence that there are persons who
believe that there is a real airsbip afloat.
One of these, a boy who has been in the
navy, has written to him making applica
tion for position of cabin-boy or deck
hand. A large part of his time is takeo
up answering questions. Judges of the
courts have already made application for
passes, he says, and he haa no end of
chances to discuss the mechanism of the
vessel. With all this, Mr. Collins throws
a dash of cold water on some enthusiasts
who base their theories upon alleged ut
terances of his.
"I am sorry to see," he said yesterday,
"that the newspapers have been attribut
ing to me such an extensive knowledge
relative to this airship. In truth I know
very little about it.
"On Thursday last there came to my
office a former client of mine for whom I
had prosecuted a claim against the Crocker
estate about six months ago, and asked
me to get gut a patent for him for an air
ship he said he had invented. I said I
could not do anything unless he produced
a model, and he said he would have one
made at once. He attempted to give me
a description of tbe invention, but I told
him it would be of no use to me. lam
now awaiting his return with the model.
He may call any day. When he brings
the model I will make application for his
patent.
'â¢I know nothing about the airship. I
do not know what it is made of, what
power propels it, nor where its inventor
now is. lam just as skeptical and in
credulous regarding it as anybody can be.
"The reason I believe this airship that
people claim to have seen is his invention
is that on the day he called he remarked :
" Did you see an account of my airship
passing over Sacramento in the newspaper

Balloon In the Sky.
OROVILLE, Cal., Nov. 23. â Several
people in this vicinity saw a moving light
jin the heavens Sunday evening. To-day's
i investigations result in learning of a Por
tuguese, living . in Cherokee, who sent up
an experimental balloon last evening in
flated with gas from a fire attached to it
in which turpentine and resin are the
principal parts. There is no doubt tnis is
the light seen here. The Portuguese says
he does not think his balloon sailed more
than twelve miles. It was his intention
j to send up another to-night but rain pre-
I vented it. _^,^^^^^^^^^ ;
Spun let Highly of the Army.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 23.â The
: report of General J. C. Breckinridge,
I inspector-general of the army, was pub
! hshed to-day. It speaks highly of the
army as being in as good condition in
respect to inÂ«truction, discipline, equip
ment and supplies as ever before in its
history. Considerable attention, he says,
has been given to minor tactics and traiu
ing in the field, which under the present
I short service term have become more
pressing. He states his opinion that tbe
growing improvement in the quality of
tbe young men entering the army has not
abated in the least. Much of the rest of
the report consists of details not mani
festly interesting, but he especially notss
the adyance made in the new cavalry drill.

FOR INAUGURATION
Already the Hotel Business
in Washington Is
Booming.
Portions of Three Floors of the
Ebbitt House Secured for
Major McKiniey.
Merchants at the Capital City Sub
scribe Libera ly for the Ex
tensive Festivities.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 23.âEx
tensive and elaborate plans for the in
auguration of Major McKiniey as Presi
dent are already under way. The selec
tion of rooms at a hotel for the President
elect was left to Abner McKiniey, a
brother of the President-elect Mr. Mc-
Kinley's party will occupy portions 'of
three floors of the Ebbitt House. On the
second floor there will be reserved for Mr.
McKinley's own use three suites of rooms,
two double bedrooms and a large private
parlor, ail overlooking F btree't. On the
third floor all the rooms on the Four
teenth-street side of the building will be
occupied by the party and similar rooms
on the fourti. floor will be reserved for
their use. These rooms include the mite
that was oc upied by Mr. McKiniey when
he was a member of Congress. The rooms
which were occupied by Vice- President
Stavenson when he came to Washington
. four years ago are also included in the
suite.
Eight hundred applications for rooms
had been received up to Saturday night at
the Ebbitt House. At the Arlington,
Manager Bennett said the number of ap-
plications is greater than was ever known
here at this period of the year, and leads
him to the conclusion that the number of
persons who will visit the city to witness
the inaugural ceremonies will be unpre
cedented.
As soon as the committees who will
- have charge of the inausrural ceremonies
have been organized, an effort will be
made to secure an agreement from hotel
men regarding rates and accommodations.
So far there have been no steps taken to
secure anything like unilormity of prices,
and several ol the hotels, it is alleged, are
not advancing rates, but. are insisting that
rooms be engaged lor a period of a week
or ten days.
Every Washington business man ex
pects an enormous crowd of visitors, and
'â¢ arrangements for their reception and en
tertainment will undoubtedly be more
elaborate than ever before.
The announcement that S. W. Wood
ward is to be placed at tbe head of the in
aucural committee while occasioning some
surprise, because Mr. Woodward is a
sound -money Democrat, has generally
â¢ elicited favorable comment. Mr. Wood
ward is a well-known business man and
has had a great deal of experience in con
nection with the work of former inaugural
: committees.
In all recent inaugurations expenses
â¢ have been paid by the receipts from the
sale of ball tickets and privileges. The
'Â forthcoming event will be no exception to
tile rule.
The business men of the city are so cer
tain of getting their money back that
there is seldom any trouble in securing
generous contributions. It is probable
that the fund raised to defray the ex
,* penses of the coming inaugural will be
larger than ever before and that the pro
gramme of entertainments will be at
tractive to an unusual degree. There is
â already some talk of holding the inaugu
ral bail in the rotunda of the new library
building, instead of in the court of the
pension building. The rotunda, however,
would hardly be larg* enough to bold the
crowd, for the reason that the proceeds of
the ball will be used to refund all contri
'butiona to the inaugural fund. There will
be no desire upon the part of the man
ager 8 to limit the number of the tickets.
JONES TAFURS A TAX ON BEEN
Say* Nothing (Till Pan at the Short
Session Except Appropriation Sills, â 
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 23.âSen
* Â»tor James K. Jones, chairman of the
National Democratic Committee, reached
â¢ Washington this afternoon, and will re
" main here until Congress adjourns. A
.representative of the United Associated
Presses saw him at his home shortly after
his arrival, to whom the Senator talked
frankly and entertainingly upon several
-matters of current interest. He is look
ing remarkably well. He had just come
from his hunting trip in Southern Mis
souri, in company with Mr. Bryan and
Governor Stone of Missouri.
"The weather was too dry," said the
Senator, "to bag much came. The leaves
were so dry that it was impossible, owing
to the noise of the rustle, to get within at
quarter of a mile of a deer.
"i have no idea," said Senator Jones,
answering a question in regard to the
probable legislation of the appioaching
session of Congress, "that anything will
be done aside from passing the usual ap
. propriation bills. As to the Dingley bill,
what is there in the present condition to
make it any more acceptable or necessary
than it was last session?"
Discussing plans lor raising revenue Sen
ator Jones advanced several interesting
propositions.
"Many of the manufacturers," he said,
"who supported McKmley will doubtless
be surprised at the character of the bill
that will be presented to the country. The
conditions that existed when the McKiniey
bill of 1890 was passed were very different
from those that will confront Congress
when it comes to deal with the question.
Then there was a surplus to be disposed
of; now there is a formidable deficiency to
be considered. That will make necessary
a radically different sort of measure.
"For myself," said tne Senator, "I
should support a bill to increase the tax
on beer by $1 a barrel. In the first place
' the alcohol in beer does not pay an equal
tax with that in whisky, and in the sec-
ond place it is a tax that can be easily
â¢ borne. Ido not think that tobacco should
be taxed to any ereater amount than is
now levied.
"It is the one thing that the poor man
almost universally uses, and he should be
-spared an additional impost. The same
tiling is true of coffee and in a less degree
of tea, and for that reason I do not favor
taxes on them. The beer tax should be
an independent proposition It will add
â¦30,000,000 to the revenues, and if it be put
in a bill by itself the money would come
in at once.
"As to the income tax, I have not ex
amlned the decision of the Supreme Court
with a view of determining whe'.her or not
a measure could be passed which would
produce revenue from that source without
waiting for an amendment to the consti
tution. A per capita tax might be ievied;
but I am opposed to taxing poverty. I
think the property and wealth of the
country should bear the cost of govern
ment. Of course the poor man receives
just as much and the same benefits from
our institutions as the rich man, but they
shuuid be given just as public tchools are
given to him."
"What will be the policy of the Demo
cratic committee â will it continue the
fiuht as tbe Republican committee has
been reported as having decided to do â
by maintaining headquarters in the in
terim between campaigns and educating
the people by the issue of literature? "
"That has not been officially decided,"
Senator Jones answered, "and it will not
be until after consultation, the date of
which has not been settled. It will prob
ably not be until after Congress meets,
but I think you can say that the fight
will be kept up until the issue has been
fought out."
"When will that be?"
"When the peoi le of the United States
have expressed their opinion directly
upon the question of restoring siiver to
the position it occupied prior to 1873. The
platform of the Republican convention
was a straddling one; it did not declare for
the single gold standard, but only for its
maintenance until birnetalism could be
secured by international agreement.
"I have been assurred since tbÂ« election
by Republicans, some of wide reputation,
that thousands of them voted for Major
McKinly because they believed h:m to be
a bimetallic and that as much more
would be done for silver under his admin
istration as could be accomplished were
Bryan elected. And it would be done,
too. without the danger of disiurbances
that were feared inconsequence of Bryan's
election. There were behind Major Mc-
Kmley a large element who distrusted the
radical supporters of Bryan, afraid to
trust them with the administration of
affairs. But the Republicans are not
united in tins question, and they will have
to settle the matter for themselves between
now and 1900.
"I am nrmly convinced," added the
Senator with great serioutness, "ihat a
vast majority of people in this country
desire bimetallism, and if the Republicans
place themselves squarely in line for the
gold standard and the use of silver subsi
diary coinage there ran be no doubt of the
result of the contest. We failed to elect
Mr. Bryan this year because the Republi
cans had the bulk of the artisan vote and
we failed to convert enough of the farmer
vote to offset it. But they are coming our
way, and if Mr. Hanna is proceeding upon
the theory thai the farmer vote is lost to
the Republicans there can be no doubt of
the issue."
SOUND-MONEY DEMOCRATS
They Contemplate Keeping Tip a Perma-
nent Organization.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 23.â William
D. Bynum, chairman, and J. P. Frosda,
treasurer of the National Sound-money
Democrats, arrived in town yesterday for
the purpose of discussing plans for future
organization with tbe National Demo
cratic leaders in this State.
"The National Democracy will still con
tinue as a National party," Mr. Bynum
said to a reporter. "Nothing but a per
manent organization was ever contem
plated from the outset. We are the only
true Democrats, guided by the genuine
principles of the Democratic party. If
the current resolution should be an issue
four years hence and the free coinage of
silver should be advocated we surely would
nominate a Presidential candidate.
"The question now is how best to con
tinue our work, how extensive it shall be
and what shall be its general character.
In the most of the Western Slates, as in
New York, steps have already been taken
to place the organization on a permanent
footing.
"There will be a meeting of the Na
tional Executive Committee either in In
dianapolis or Chicago before the Ist of
January. Our plans for the immediate
future will then be agreed upon, and prob
ably an address to the people will be is
sued. I think that of necessity we shall
participate in State and local elections, as
we could not act with an organization
with which we are at variance in matters
of principle.
"I do not think tbe issues in the Chi
cago platform, other than that of free sil
ver, to which we were antagonistic, will
survive four years. The free silverites
will not again champion opposition to law
and order or attack the Supreme Court.
If the incoming administration effects
satisfactory financial legislation tbe
money question will amount to very little
four years from now, but if hard times
continue we shall have the fight of this
year over again.
"I do not regard the tariff issue as im
portant. All we need is a tariff bill which
will raise the revenue required. I know
the present tariff law is, in general, satis
factory to the manufacturers. Tne pas
sage of a high tariff bill would be disas
trous, and it is not needed, because of the
fall in prices. Unquestionably the public
mind is set on reform in the currency.
We in the Went believe in that as the
cause of all our troubles.
"The Indianapolis Board of Trade has
issued a notice to boards of trade in
Western cities to join with it in calling: a
National convention to consider what
should be done. This convention will un
doubtedly be held."
Mr. Bynum expressed himself as op
posed to any movement to assist sound
money Democrats to secure a place in Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet.

CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 23.â Major Me-
Kinley's most prominent caller to-day

Hills of Rubi.
Contradictory Statements About
the Failure of the Campaign
in Pinar del Rio.
By the Use of Dynamite Cuban In
surgents Wreck a Passenger
Train Near Carsinas-
HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 23. -Captain-
General Weyler arrived here this evening
from the province of Pinar del Rio. His
return has caused much comment, but as
yet it is impossible to learn the true rea
son for his leaving his command and re
turning to the capital. The military
authorities vouchsafe no information on
the subject.
The official reports concerning the move
ments of the troops in the field give only
accounts of skirmishes, with trifling losses
on either side. No news of any moment
has been received from Pinar del Rio.
By an explosion of dynamite a passen
ger train was wrecked to-day near Car
sinas, province of Matanzas. The en
gineer and fireman and two passengers
were hurt. The six cars composing the
train were set on tire by the rebels who
caused the explosion.
As is customary, a pilot engine was run
ning in front of the passenger train. This
was allowed to pass the point where the
dynamite was placed, but a little further
on a rail had been loosened, and when the
pilot engine struck it ths engine was
thrown into a ditch.
Counsel for Lewis Someilan, a natural
ized American citizen, who was arrested
some time ago on the charge of being a
rebel and conspiring against the Spanish
Government, has petitioned the court for
the release of his client on the ground
that there is no evidence to convict him.
Thirty-eight political suspects and
prisoners convicted of ordinary crimes
were sent to the penal settlement on the
Isle of Pines to-day.
MADRID, Spain, Nov. 23.â Many con
tradictory statements have been received
regarding the intention of Captain-Gen
eral Weyler, who is leading the campaign
against Maceo in the province of Pinar del
Rio, Cuba.
It was stated some time ago that the
campaign had resulted in failure and Gen
eral Weyler proposed returning to Havana.
This was denied and later the statement
was made that the Government had in
formed General Weyler that owing to
questions of international and domestic
politics it would not be expedient for him
to return to Havana until he had won a
decisive victory over thÂ» rebels.
On top of the conflicting statements a
dispatch to-day from the Havana corre
spondent of the Imparcial, who is gener
ally well informed, states without reserve
that General Weyler will arrive in Ha
vana this evening from Pinar del Rio. Re
liance is placed upon the dispatch here,
it being held that if it were not true it
could hardly have passed the censor at
Havana.
OTTAWA, Oxt., Nov. 23.â The Minis
ter of Marine was advised to-day that the
steamer Bermuda, the suspected filibus
ter, was reported to be at Halifax, tak
ing on arms and ammunition for Cuba.
Tbe report is said to have come through
the Spanish Consul. The Canadian Gov
ernment always investigates Mich re
ports, but they have generally turned out
to be groundless.
NORFOLK, Va., Nov. 23.â The activity
in mounting new euns and makine other
improvemsuts at Fort Monroe has excited
great interest in view of the war rumors
now prevalent. Colonel Royal Frank,
commandant of Fort Monroe, in an inter
view to-day disclaims any knowledge that
these improvements indicate trouble with
Spain, and declares to be without founda
tion tbe report that he has been ordered
to have the fort in readiness for defense
by December L
By that date, however, the new battery
of three ten-inch disappearing rifles will
have been completed, and a month later,
by order of Secretary Lamont, one of the
most formidable batteries on the coast
will also have been completed. This will
make this fort modern in all respects, and
especially impregnable to any such fleet
as Spain might bring against it in the
event of a war with that country.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 23. -A Jack
sonville (Fla. ) dispatch says: A cipher
message from Havana to a Cuban leader
here says that General Weyler has deter
mined to return to Havana, and the city
is in great confusion. vVeyler gives no
excuse, it is said, except that it is too hot
and unhealthy to do any fighting.
It is openly asserted in Havana that
Weyler became frightened because Maceo
had set a price upon his head or his
capture.
Wevler's scouts informed him that
Maceo might mate an attempt on Ha
vana, and the Spanish general retreated in
hot haste to tbe safety of his palace.
PLEADS GUILTY OF LARCENY.
Ex-Banker Anthony Kozel Will Serve a
Long Term in the Illinois
Penitentiary.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 23.â Ex-Banker
Anthony Kozel, who failed last May for
1114.000, was locked up this afternoon and
to-morrow will go to Joliet Prison on an
indefinite sentence, having confessed to
fraudulent practices in handling funds en
trusted to his care, and asked for an im
mediate sentence. It was quietly agreed
that Kozel will to-morrow morning plead
Kuilty to larceny and be sent to the peni
tentiary. In the transactions covering
Kozel's shortage some $8000 is involved.
He was indicied on three cbarees of lar
ceny, two of obtaining money under false
pretenses and one of forgery.
Kozel is the first bunker to go to the
penitentiary in this State for the misuse
of funds entrusted to via care. The fa
mous Meadowcraft cast is still hung up in
the United States Supreme Court, and the
cases against Keene and Niehoff are
pending. ,
Kozel's Dank was one of the oldest on
the West Side, and at the time of his
failure was regarded as a model of finan
cial soundness. Investigation showed
that aJI tna while Kczel had been doing
business in gross violation of the banking
laws. In many instances it was found
he had dealt in securities that had been
incuiubered for more than their original
value. While Kozel's liabilities footed up
$J 14.000 his assets brought only $2000â
hardly enough to pay the expenses of the
investigation. It was agreed to let Kozel
plead guilty to larceny rather than a
graver charge, as he is over 50 years of age
and broken in health.
SWINDLED BY AN OLD TRICK.
Spicer Berry, Once a Well- Known Cali-
fornia Miner, the Victim of Two
Clever Sharpers.
CORNING, N. V., Nov. 23. â Spicer
Berry, a retired business man and a Targe
real estate owner, was the victim of ,an
old-time swindle of the tin box and three
card trick to-day. For several days a
well-dressed man has been trying to ar
range for the purchase of one of Berry's
lots at Canton, near here. To-day Berry
and the supposed land-purchaser started
out to drive to see the farm, and met a
poorly dressed man, who said he was from
the South and had lost a sum of money
at cards in this place last night. The
Southerner did not mourn much, as he
displayed a large roll of bills and had
money in every pocket. He began to show
the three-card trick, at which he lost his
money last evening. The well-dressed
swinder and Berry became interested and
theformer oet $5 with the second stranger,
which be won. Then he suggested to
Berry that they play for a stake of $5000.
of which the well-dressed stranger was to
f urniÃh $2200 and Berry $2800. Berry con
sented and came to the city and drew the
money out of the bank. They returned
and found the poorly dressed stranger
was asking for them. The money was
placed in a tin box, and the man said he
would have to go to Elmira to get the
$2200. Both the swindlers consented to
aliow Berry to take care of the box and
they started off. When Berry opened the
box he found it contained nothing but a
stone and some paper. Berry made con
siderable of his money digging gold in
California.
HEBREWS TAKE EXCEPTION.
They See an Intended Slur in the Lan-
guage of the President's Thanks
giving Proclamation.
BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. 23.âConsider
able interest has been aroused in Hebrew
circles here by the language used by Presi
dent Cleveland in his Thanksgiving proc
lamation. The particular words are:
"Asking a continuance of heavenly favor
through the mediation of Him who taught
us how to pray."
Rev. Dr. A. Guttmacher of the Balti
more congregation, who is to deliver the
Thanksgiving address next Thursday at
the union services in Har Sinai Temple,
said to-day: "1 cannot bring myself to
believe that a slight was intended. Presi
dent Cleveland is too broad-minded a
man to stoop to sectarian prejudices."
Rev. Tobias Scho/arber, rabbi of the Har
Sinai Temple, said: "The President made
a big mistake. His meaning is plain and
1 do not see how it could have been other
wise than intentional. The Government
of this country has nothing to do with
any one's religion. It is questionable
whether any Thanksgiving proclamation
should be sent forth by any President.
Jefferson refused to issue a proclamation
on the eround that such matters bad
nothing to do with the government of the
country."
BRYAN'S HOUSE IN QUARANTINE.
Diphtheria m the Family of the Late Can-
didate of the Divided Silver Demo
crats for President.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Nov. 23.â Health Offi
cer Rhode this morning went out to 1625
D street and tacked a quarantine card
upon Hon. William J. Bryan's house.
Ruth, the 11-year-old daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan and the eldest child in tbe
household, is afflicted with diphtheria,
and the usual precautionary measures
had to be taken by the authorities to pre
vent the spreading of the disease. The
doctors in attendance pronounce the at
tack to be a slight one and have hopes of
a speedy disappearance of the malady.
The quarantine will not materially affect
Mr. Bryan's movements, nor did it pre
vent his departure for Denver at 6 o'clock
this evening. He expects to return
Thanksgiving day, and, if possible, will
begin active work on his forthcoming
book. His publisher, W. B. Conkey of
Chicago, is in the city conferring with Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan as to its publication.
H ARRISO N'S HOUSE LOOTED.
JcxioeU Carried Off by a Bold Porch-
Climber.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 23.âGen
eral Harrison was made the victim of a
burglar to-night and the gold watch that
Mrs. Harrison has carried for years is
among the missing valuables. The work
was done by a porch-climber during the
early part of the evening wlrle the
servants were out and General and Mrs.
Harrison were entertaining ex-Attorney-
General Miller, who had dropped in for a
call. When they went to retire about 10
o'clock Mrs. Harrison missed the watch,
which had been lying on her dresser, and
her purse was found lying open with a
small amount of change missing. General
Harrison began an investigation and
found that an entrance had been forced
from the roof of the veranda above the
front door into the study upstairs by pry
ing the lock from the window. The thiÂ»f
bad eventually gone from this room across
the hall to Mrs. Harrison's room. He nad
climbed one of the pillars of the veranda
on the south side and walked around to
the front of the roof. No trace of him
could be found.
NO COMPLAINT TO BE MADE
Destruction of a Spanish lag in Dela
ware MM Officially Acted Upon.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 23.â The
Spanish legation is not likely to ' make
any complaint to this Government with
reference to the action of the students at
Newcastle, Del., a few days ago, who de
stroyed a Spanish flag. There is no Span
ish Consul at Newcastle i and i he: incident
to that extent was robbed of any official
character. Moreover, both the Spanish
and American Governments have reached
so perfect an understanding with refer
ence :to i circumstances of this character
that little if any importance, is attached to
them. It was said at the State Depart
ment to-day that if a Spanish flag dis
played from a Spanish consulate or war
ship had been offered an indignity the at
tention of the State Department would at
once be directed to the matter anil a suit
able apology demanded. ;; It is regarded as
not unlikely, that the "jineo" press of
Spain may attempt to magnify the inci
dent, but there is excellent authority for'
the statement that 1 : it will receive: no of
ficial attention either at the hands of the
American or Spanish authorities.

LADY SCOTT IN
A CRIMINAL DOCK
Prosecution of Earl Rus
sell's Mother-in-Law
for Libel.
Allegations That a Bold Attempt
Was Made to Collect
Blackmail.
An Outline of the Case Made by Sir
Francis Lockwood to a
Crowded Court.
LONDON, Esq., Nov. 23. -The trial of
Lady Tina Scott, the mother of Countess
Russell, and the other defendants, Cocker
ton, Kast and Aylott, upon the charge of
libeling Earl Russell, Lady Scott's son-in
law, began in the Central Criminal Court,
Old Bailey, this morning. The courtroom
was crowded, most of the spectators being
persons well known in fashionable circles.
Sir Francis Locuwood, Q. C, for the
prosecution, stated that Kast and Aylott
were cabin-boys on board Earl Russell's
yactu in 1858 and that Cocke^ton was tne
engineer of the vessel. Since that time,
he said, the Earl had never seen any of
them. Counsel then referred to the Earl's
unhappy marriage and the disgusting
charges which had been brought against
him by Countess Russell at the instance
of her mother, Laay Scott, upon the re
ported statements of the other defendants,
Kast, Aylott and Cockerton.
Sir F. Lockwood called attention to the
action at law which Countess Russell
brought against her husband, Earl Rus
sell, more than a year a^o, for the pur
pose, as alleged, of obtaining a restitution
of her conjugal rights. This litigation, he
said, had been incited by Lady Scott, and
though its ostensible object was the res
toration of Countess Russell's marital
rights, the real object was to extort money
from the Earl.
At this point in the argument of the
counsel for the prosecution Lady Scott be
came greatly agitated and smote the front
of the dock violently with her hands.
Continuing his remarks counsel declared
that no woman could be so base as to de
sire her daughter to resume cohabitation
with her husband if she believed that the
charges of immorality and cruelty which
Countess Ru3sell had brought against the
Earl and which bad not been supported
by the evidence in the Countess' original
suit for judicial separation were true.
Sir Francis Lockwood then read state
ments made by the prisoner, Kast, alleg
ing the commission of an indecent act by
Lord Russell on board his yacht on the
night of June 19, 1888. Earl Russell, he
said, could prove that on tbe night in
question he had slept in Winchester and
did not go on board his yacht until June
20. Proof of Lady Scott's animus and
tendency toward blackmail, he said, was
shown in the fact that circulars contain
ing the terrible charges against Earl Rus
sell were sent to the masters of the schools
in which Lord Russell was educated.
Counsel gave another instance oi the
falsity of the charges by showing that
when Earl Russell took measures to bring
Kast and Cockerton to justice they were
examined privately as to the time and
place of the alleged acts, and they w re
obliged to withdraw their accusations. Sir
Francis Lockwood concluded by saying
that the whole affair was a horrible con
spiracy.
At this point in the proceedings Lady
Scott was permitted to leave the dock
upon the understanding that she should
not be permitted to communicate with
any of the witnesses in the case.
Sir Francis Lockwood. resuming his ar
gument, said that Lady Scott first came
into communication with Cockerton, Kast
and Aylott in November, 1895, when
blackmailing designs were arranged with
Countess Russell. Then, be said, Kast's
brother wrote to the Earl, saying that an
agent of Lady Scott was searching for his
brother, who was in the army in India,
witn a view of getting his assistance in
making charges against his lordship. Earl
Russell immediately consulted his solic
itors, who wired Kast, warning him that,
he was being made a catspaw in the con
coction of filthy charges.
it was eventually ascertained that Lady
Scott's agents bou.ht Kast out of the
army in India and supplied him with
money. While in Bombay Kast wrote to
a private in his old regiment, saying that
he was staying at the best hotel in Bora
bay with 7 rupees a day md everything
found except strong drinls. In fact, he
was "doing the heavy" at i.o expense to
himself. It would be proved, Sir Francis
Lockwood said, that Lady Scott's de
tective, Smith, had supplied Kast with
money.
Calling attention to the assertion of the
defendants that after Kast had left Earl
Russell's yacht his Lordship had seni him
a postal-card, addressing him as "Dear
Fred," inviting niin to join the Earl's
yacht as cabin-boy, Sir Frank said:
"I shall call as the first witness Earl
Russell himself, who will show that the
dates involved in the accusations are im
possible and the facts alleged Jmprobable.
Meanwhile I ask your Worship to hold the
defendants hand and foot until this case is
fully heard."
The male defendants were not allowed
out on bail, but Lady Scott was permitted
to go out on bail, with the understanding
that she was to have no communication
with any oae connected with the case ex
cept her counsel.
The greatest interest is being taken in
the case and crowds of people sought ad
mission to the courtroom to-day in vain,
the court being packed to the extreme
limit of its capacity.
To As*iat the Strikers.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 23.â The executive
committee of the London dock-laborers'
union has received a dispatch from the
leaders of the strikers at Hamburg asking
them to do all in their power to prevent
steamers from Hamburg seeking coal from
procuring it. Tne coal-heavers at Ham
burg yesterday decided to join the strike
of the dock-laborers, and tiii.i action, it is
believed, will compel steamers accus
tomed to coal at Hamburg to seek their
fuel elsewhere. Should the London men
refuse to coal steamers putting into the
Thames to fill their bunker* their action
would, it is thought, tend to greatly
strenptnen the cau-e of the Hamburg
strikers.
Emerson to Succeed Winter.
ST. JOHNS, N. F., Nov. 23.â The Hon.
George Emerson, a member of the Cabinet,
will succeed to the vacancy on the Sn
preme Court bench created by the resigna
tion of S:r James Winter, owing to a
reduction in hiÂ» salary through the Gov
ernment retrenchment policy. Mr. Emer
son's appointment is a personal defeat for
Premier Whiteway, who sought the
position for his law partner, Mr. Johnson.
WALES VISITS BLENHEIM PALACE.
Royal Guests to Remain a Week at the
Home of the Former Miss Consuelo
Vanderbilt.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 25.â The Prince
and Princess of Wales came to Woodstock
this evening to pay a visit to the Duke
and Duchess of Marlborough at Blenheim
Palace. Their royal Highnesses were ac
companied by their daughters, Princess
Victoria of Wales and Princess Maude of
Denmark, and Prince Charles of Denmark,
husband of Princess Maude. The special
train with the royal visitors was met by
the Duke of Marlborougb, who was await
ing at the station. A large crowd of peo
ple assembled outside. The royal party
were greeted with cheers as they made
their way to the carriages in which they
were driven to Blenheim Palace.
The carriages were escorted by the Mayor
and the Town Council on foot, and the
Woodstock Fire Brigade acted as a guard
of honor, marching behind the carriages
to the gates of Blenheim Park. The
Prince and Princess of Wales were en
thusiastically cheered by the people who
lined the roadway.
Among the guests other than those of
the royal party were Lady Randolph
Churchill and Mr. and Mrs. George N.
Curzon. The town of Woodstock was
beautifully decorated with flags, banners
and triumphal arches, in their honor.
The Prince and Princess of Wales and
the other guests will remain a week, dur
ing which time there will be a succession
of fetes, torchlight processions, etc. In
addition to this the Prince will <nake
shooting excursions into the Blenheim
game preserves daily.
Owing to the recent death in New York
of Mrs. W. H. Vanderbilt, grandmother of
the Duchess of Marlborough, the annual
ball will be abandened, but public cele
brations will continue throughout the
week, including a grand reception given
by the Duchess of Marlborough oa Friday,
at which most of the leading aristocrats
will assemble.

WAS IT STOLEN BY THE SENTRY?
One Thousand Mexican Dollars Boldly
Carried Away From the Cruiser
Boston.
CHEEFOO. China, Oct. 2(s.â The United
States cruiser Boston, Captain Frank
Wildes, is here at this writing, but at this
season of the year Chpefoo offers few at
tractions to naval officers, and the officers
of the Boston are very little in evidence.
The naval sensation just now is the loss of
1000 Mexican dollars from the Boston,
which Mexican dollars were taken by some
person or persons, who, if the necessity
arose, would carry off a hot stove. The
dollars disappeared from a box outside
thÂ° cabin door. This statement may strike
the uninitated as a trifle odd, but, in the
language of the poet:
â¢Tis true, 'tis pity,
And pity 'tis 'tis true.
Paymaster Martin found that he could
not store the box's contents, 4000 Mexican
dollars in his safe, so Captain Wildes gave
orders that the box. which is iron -strapped,
made of inch boards heav'ly nailed and
ntted with two rope bandies â the regular
box in which all silver comes from the
banks here, weight about. 250 pounds
should be placed outside the cabin door,
under the eye of the orderly. One night
the orderly and another man disappeared
and by coincidence one of the straw mat
ting bags of coin, of which thÂ«Â»re are four
in each box, was missed next day. There
is no doubt that the two and some accom
plices carried off the money. To prove it
is another thing. A court of inquiry has
been sitting here for a week, but thus far
the evidence necessary for a conviction is
said to be wanting.
The robbery is one of the most remark
able in the annals of naval history and
there are those who do not hesitate to ex
press surprise at the moderation of the
thieves who, had they been so disposed,
judging by the evidence of their ability,
might just as well have carried off the
safe and a portion of the ship's arma
ment, or even the ship herself.
Drowned in Jamiica*a Floods.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Nov. 23.â Advices
received here from Fort de France, capi
tal of the island of Martinique, say that
heavy raics .throughout the island have

immense damage has been done. A num
ber of persons in the interior, all of whom
are believed to have been negroes, have
been drowned.

HUSBAND AND WIFE
FOULLY MURDERED
Three Hungarians Commit
a Fiendish Crime in a
Mining Town.
Robbery the Motive of the Deed,
but the Perpetrators Fail to
Secure Booty.
Quick Capture of the Assassins, Who
Narrowly Escape Lynching at the
Hmds of Citizens.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., Nov. 23.â The
mining town of Nesqueherlng, in Carbon
County, was the scene of the wildest ex
citement yesterday when it became known
that a terrible murder had been com
mitted, the victims being Mrs. Caspar La
Boye and her husband.
The former was instantly killed and the
latter fatally injured. The perpetrators of
the crime are three Hungarians, who were
arrested by a number of men while at
tempting to make their escape, and had it
not been for the interference of the police,
all chree would have been lynched. The
prisoners were taken to Mauch Chunk and
are now in jail awaiting a hearing.
The La Boyes have always been looked
upon as upright, hard-working people,
and during the past ten years have ac
cumulated quite a snug sum of money.
To secure their hard-earned earnings,
which were supposed to be hidden in their
home, tbe murderers entered the house at
an early hour in the morning.
On hearing their footsteps Mrs. La Boya
became aroused and awakened her hus
band. A moment later and at the sight of
one of the intruders. La Boye jumped
from his bed ana a scuffle ensued, but be
fore he could do anything the three
grabbed him and in an instant be lay
prostrate on the floor.
Mrs. La Boye started for the street to
give an alarm, but before she- had reached
the foot of the stairs she was overtaken
by one of the Hungarians, who buried the
blade of a stiletto deep into her breast,
causing almost instant death.
The robbers then became alarmed on
hearing a noise on the ouiside, but before
escaping from the residence they slashed
La Boye with their knives in a most hor
rible manner, leaving him, as they sup
posed, dead on the floor.
When it became known that a murder
had been committed a posse of citizens was
formed and a thorough search was made
for the assassins. Every foot of ground
was gone over in the neighborhood, and
on reaching an old shanty near the rail
road station they found three burly Hun
garians.
They were spattered with blood, and
each had the appearance of having teen
engaged in a struggle. They could give
no account of themselves, not being able
to speak English, and it was all the^offi
cers could do to keep th<Â» people from
stringing them up to a tree.
As to the Sugar Industry.
LONDON, Erg., Nov. 23.â A representa
tive of tbe United Associated Presses
obtained an interview to-day with Neville
Lubbock, who is at the head of the Colo
nial Company, the leading West Indies
sugar firm, upon the subject of the neces
sity of sending a commission to British
West Indies to inquire into the critical
condition of the sugar industry, the ad
visability of which the Colonial Office is
now considering. Mr. Lnbbock said that
the present indications were that a con
ference of some kind on the situation
would be held shortly, as the question
was becoming very acute. Germany and
Austria, he said, were quite prepared to
enter into an international agreement to
regulate the product of suear, but in the
meantime the British Government, main
tained its old attitude. The proposed
commission, Mr. Lubbock thought, would
have no effect.

PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 23. â Dudley
Evans, champion middle-weight of the

STATE EDITORS
INVADE VALLEJO
The California Association
and Sacramsnto Valley
League Meet
Officers of the Former Organiza
tion Re-elected for the
Ensuing Term.
Colonel Irish Denounces Journals That
Sacrifice Character for
Gain.
VALLEJO, Cal., Nov. 23.â The rain
fairly poured down in torrents in Vallejo
to-day. It seemed as if the city had been
selected by nature as a funnel for tbe con
tents of the clouds. But the dampness
was not everywhere. That is impossible,
according to Charles A Carroll, the
youthful editor of the Calistogian, so long
as a body of journalists are anywhere in
sight.
For the rural editor reigned supreme in
Vallejo, for the time at least, it being the
occasion of the annual session of the Cali
fornia Press Association. The morning
trains and all the boats coming into the
town numbered among their passengers
editors from every part of the State.
Not a man brought a pencil, such a
habit being against the unwritten rules ot
tbe association on the occr.sion of its an
nual festival. Even the man who drafted
the resolutions had to go forth and borrow
the graphite wherewith to perform his
duty.
Happy-mannered A. J. Wiley of the
Eureka Times was one of the first to be
washed into the town by the flood. As he
walked up the street toward a hotel ex
haling the pleasant odor of the Humboldt
County redwood forests the street urchins,
anticipating the lively times in prospect
for the day, gathered on the corner and
whispered, "Here comes the first one,
boys," in so audible a tone that Editor
Wiley turned and grinned bis appreci
ation.
Then there was Scipio Craig of the Red
lands Citrograph, who was a marked man
among his brethren by the redolent odor
of citrus fruits which pervaded the at
mosphere about him. When he and
Brother Wiley were introduced Craig
said:
"I would have known you were from the
north."
"Well," answered Wiley, with a laugh,
"1 would have bet my hat you were from
the south."
The oldest editor present was the vener
able scribe of the Selraa Enterprise, V. I.
Willis, whose hair bore mute testimony to
the whitening effect of the snows of sixty
two winters. In strong contrast to Editor
Willis was George W. Filcher, associate
editor of the Placer Herald. His life's
journey had seen on'y twenty-two mile
stones fade from tight, but that he was
happy in his chosen vocation was evident.
One remarkable thing in connection
with this year's meeting of the association
was that instead of a tele of woe as regards j
the condition of the various sections of the j
State everybody had cheering news of a !
revival of business. Even Democratic cdi- j
tors of the most pronounced type ad- I
mitted that McKinley's election seemed |
to augur better limes.
At \1 a. m. the Sacramento Valley Press
League convened in San Pablo Hall, forty
members being present, most of whom are :
members of the State association. Presi- ;
dent Raleigh Barcar delivered a short ad- |
dress, expressing his pleasure that de- i
spue the inclement weather so many
members were present.
The executive committee reported that !
no report had been prepared. This was
followed by the reading of tbe minutes of
the last meeting by the secretary.
H. A. McCraney of the Sacramento
County Ledger and T. G. Springer of the
Butte County Pendulum were admitted to
membership in the league. Later W. C.
Brown of the Martinez Gazette was
brought forward as a candidate to settle
the mooted question of whether a man
living in the San Joaquin Valley couid be
admitted to membership. There were no
dissenting voies and Mr. Brown was duly
admitted.
Editors McCraney. Morris, Bessac and j
Willis then took active part in a discus- j
sion of the question of whether a legisla- i
tire committee should be formeJ. It was I
finally decided that the interest of the!
league required such a committee, and j
President Barcar appointed G. A. Morris j
of the Marysville Appeal and E. li. Willis
of the Sacramento Record- Union as two
of the members, himself constituting the
third.
H. A. McCranev of tbe Sacramento '
County Ledger. L. B. Littlerield of the !
Honcut Pendulum and L. H. Woodworth !
of the Yuba City Farmer drew up resolu
tions of respect to the memory of the wife '
of A. H. Downer of the Crockett Record I
and George Ohieyer, an honorary member. !,
Editors Dinkelspiel. Woodw'orth and â¢'
Dodson were appointed a committee to !
draw up resolutions thanking the people 1
of Vallejo for their hospitality. The meet
ing then adjourned, with the understand
ing tbat tbe spring convention would be â 
held at Oroville in May.
Promptly at 2 P. M. the California Press
Association opened its session. President
E. B. Willis introduced Colonel John P. !
Irish, who had been invited to address the '
meeting. Despite tbe fact that Colonel
Irish had got up in the senii-darjcness of
the early morning and made the mistake
of putting on one black and one tan ehoo,
had broken the handle off his cherished
umbrella on the trip to Vallejo aud fallen
in love with a swarthy deckhand on the
boat, who he thought would have made
an ideal pirate, he came forward in great
good humor and maie a telling speech.
He also chose the occasion to make a furi
ous onslaught on the San Francisco Ex
aminer. In part he said :
I don't intend to talk to you to-day about
the businefi* of manufacturing newspapers, for
that is what it is. Man who have more naoney
than they know what to do with nowaday*
seem to have gone into the newspaper busi
ness, lhe men who really make them are
really so many operatorsâ nothing moreâ and
there it nothing ol individuality in them.
Nobody seems to be responsible for anything
tbat appears in a metropolitan journal". Th-e
man who owns the paper may really live in
tome other State than that in which it Is pub
lished. He may even live in Egypt. With a
country paper It is different. There the pages
are generally clean, because everybody knows
who ii responsible for what appears therein.
Every page is marked by the individuality of
the editor.
Here lately there has appeared an editorial
in thu Portland Oregonian aaeut the people oi
Scene *t the Reception to the California Press Association in the Parlors of the Bernard House at Vallejo.
this State that seems to have aroused almost
universal antipathy. Let me say before I go
further that to my mind the Portland Orego
nian is one of the best edited papers in the
country.
People of other States take a community to
be what is reflected In the columns of its
daily press. If the news In the metropolitan
journals is of nothing but crime and scandal
necessarily tbe people take the community to
be degraded. Let me give you an iustance.
Not long ago au Eastern gentleman was at my
table to dinner. He had in his hand a copy of
a San FranciÂ«co morning paper, and after pe
rusing It diligently for a few moments he said:
"Irish! I wouldn't live in your State for the
world."
"Why?" I queried in surprise.
"Well," he answered, "simply because tbe
life of the people of any section of the couutry
is reflected in its daily press. I have been
reading this paper very carefully"â and now,
my friends, listen carefully to what I am go
ing to state, because the paper that Eastern
gentleman held in his hand was a copy of the
Baa Francisco Examinerâ "and It is four-flithi
full oi crime aud scandal and vicious insinua
tions and rottenness and filth of the worst do
scriotion.'*
What do you think of that? And yet the
very paper that gave the Portland Oregonian
cause for making a justifiable attack upon the
good people of this State was the very loudest
in its denunciation of the editorial to which 1
have referred.
What I wish is that this association could
go East once a year and show the people there
what kind of civilization we really have here.
I want them to see our local press held up as a
mirror to the world oi what we really are.
Mexico and the Sandwich Islands, which I
bar* understood have been mentioned as !
destinations for trips in the luture, are all I
well enough as places to enjoy yourselves, but I
what would do you and the country in gen
eral more goodâ l might say the most goodâ |
would bÂ« & trip to the East.
There is one thing which makes look
npou the professioa ot journalism with hope,
and that is the entry into the profession of:
woman. I believe that woman is always en- j
nobhng in her influence, and that she is, at j
least in this one instance, is already proved by j
tbe higher moral tone of tbe press whero !
woman is concerned.
I am glad that the country press of this State
is banded together In tills organization. It
will in time be productive of excellent results.
] Lave not tried to Hatter you. I never try to
flatter intelligent men, because it does no
good, and I never try to flutter lools, because
it does them no good.
At the conclusion of Colonel Irish's
address, which was greeted with great
applause, especially his caustic comments
on the San Francisco Examiner, G. M.
Francis of the Napa Register moved that
a vote of thanks be extended to him.
This was done unanimously, the speaker
riiing and bowing hia thanks.
Nor was tbe assemblage satisfied with
this action. J. A. Filcher, president of
the State Board of Trade and proprietor of
the Placer Herald, rose and said:
"Gentlemen, Colonel Irish has not only
sustained nis reputation as an orator and
a journalist, but he has driven home to
our minds a realization of the fact that the
action of certain newspapers in giving
filth instead of news to the public i 3 what
has brought condemnation upon the State
by outsiders, something we have not given
the thought it demands. I move ttiat we
show our appreciation by making him an
honorary member of the California Press
Association."
This motion prevailed without a disient
inc vote.
A legislative committee was appointed,
in the persons of R. V. Robertson. H. A.
McCraney, W. F. Prisk and W. S. Mel
lick. Mellick, who is Representative,
elect from the Seventieth District as well
as editor of the Lancaster Gazette, made
an earnest speech on the subject of libel,
stating that if he carried any hobby into
the Legislature it would be lor the good of
the journalistic profession.
.J. A. Filcher. introduced a resolution
which was adopted, asking all rural edi
tors to use* their influence in securing an
appropriation of $10,000 from the next
Legislature to exhiDit California resources
at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.
The report of the president and secre
tary showed i the ; association to be in a
flourishing condition, botn,as regard
membership and finances. The by-laws
were amended to * make, honorary mem
bership possible only on recommendation
of the executive committee. Several other
trilling amendments were also made.
An accredit of nineteen was made in
membership. This brings the total up to

FRESNO COUNTY'S GAIN.
Promised Development of Vast Lumber
Interests by a Michigan Syn
dicate.
FRESNO, Cal., Nov. 23 âOne of tne re
suits of the election of McKinley will, in
all probability, be tbeÂ«early beginning of
operations by the Michigan syndicate
which has vast lumber interests on tbe
North Fork, Whisky Creer and Rock
Creek, in the mountains of this county.
Over four years ago the syndicate started
in to develop that region, but the election
of Cleveland resulted in the sudden
abandonment of all development work.
it was stated several months ago by a
person interested in the enterprise that if '
McKinley was elected it would not be '<
lo.ig before the syndicate resumed opera- |
tions, add those who beard the remark
are waiting confidently for tbe syndicate '
to make good its promise. There is no i
doubt but that it will do so, and the in- !
portar.ee of it to Fresno can hardly be told. '
There are no finer forests of sugar Dine â 
| anywhere in the country than are to be
found in the 20.000 acres of timber land '
| owned by the syndicate on the north fork !
j of the San Joaquin, and tbe development
of that region will open what those who '
have visited it term a sportsman's Dara- |
disc. The hunting and fishing are said
to be unexcelled, and it will probably not I
be long before a summer resort is estab- !
lisbed in the neighborhood.
It is part of the plans of the syndicate j
to establish its mills in Fresno, connecting
them with the logging camp by means of
an electric railway. Tbe advantage of
having the mills located in this city is
that the company can in that event dis- .
pose of the great amount of refuse of such !
a lar>;e concern. Slabs could be worked
into boxes, pickets and laths, and the saw- '
dust could also be disposed of profitably, i
The railway would be from fifty to sixty '
miles in length and the syndicate could !
j either develop its own power or obtain it
from the San Joaquin Electric Company.
Some of the wealthiest men of the coun- I
try are interested in the syndicate, among !
them being General Alger. But while i
wealthy they are not the kind of men who
are willing to endeavor to promote enter
prises under a disadvantage, which ac
counts for their suspending work under j
the Cleveland regime. With a good pro- I
tective tariff, however, they could well af
!-ford to carry out their early plans.
The prosecution of the gigantic enter- |
prise will give work to hundreds of men i
and add uiuteriuliy to the wealth of the '
county:

ASSESSORS MEET
AT SACRAMENTO
Gather in Convention to
Arrange a Uniform
System.
Defects in the Assessment Laws
Will Receive Needed
Attention.
Nearly Evitj C;unty in the State
Has a Representative at the
CoLf jrence.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Nov. 23.â For I
the first time in the history of the State
the Assessors of the various counties met
in convention to-day, nearly every Asses
sor in the State being present. The con
ventioa met at 10 o'clock this morning in (
the State Capitol building, but owing to i
the fact that Winfield Scott of Kern i
County, the originator of the convention |
idea, was numbered among the absent '
few, it wa9 mutually agreed to make no
move toward organisation until his arrival. '
At 2 o'clock, Scott having arrived, the !
convention was called to order and a tern- !
portry organization was effected, with !
Scott of Kern as temporary chairman, and
A. C Richards, Deputy Assessor of Ala
nieda, as secretary.
The roll was called, the following-named
Assessors and deputies being present: T. |
H. Berkey, Sacramento; John Adams, j
Placer: C. D. Hay wood, San Mateo; Wil- !
:iam M. Nuner Jr., Calaveras; S. S. Rus

G. v 7. Follett, Kings: Charles Schirmer.
Solano, and W. A. McÃaeâ a total repre
sentation of thirty-six counties.
It was resolved that ail the chief depu
ties having credentials De admitted to the j
convention on the same footing as tha
Assessors, and an adjournment of ten
minutes was taken for the purpose of
tllowing the chair to select a committee
of five on permanent organization and
order of business. When the convention
was again called to order, the following i
committee was announced: Spitzer of I
Santa Clara, Summerland of Los Angeles,
Ortman of San Joaquin, Siebe of San
Jrrancisco and Meacham of Napa. On
motion. Winfield Scott was added to the
committee.
The chairman also appointed the fol
lowing committee on credentials: Bar
ham of Tehama, Donlan of Ventura, King
of San LuisObiipo, Vincent of Fresno and
Ludwig of Shasta. Then the convention
adjourned until to-morrow at 10 o'clock.
lhe purposes ot the convention are
manifold and are deemed of great ad
vantage to the State at large. There are a
great many defects in the assessment laws,
and it is intended to agree upon some
plans to remedy them. In many in
stances Assessors have to do a great deal
of unnecessary work, which involves
waste of time and labor. The "field en
rollment-book" is an instance of the kind,
and seems to have gained the ill will of
nearly every Assessor in the State.
Another thing that will receive atten
tion is the method ot collecting personal
property tax. It is believed tbÂ»t under
the present system a large amount of per
sonal property escapes taxation. The
reason for this is that the law holds an
Assessor personally responsible for the
personal property tax. so the Assessor will
not assess where he has any douot of
being abie to collect the taxes. As one of
the Assessors put it, "We would be re
quired to sell a poor family out of house
or home, or else pay tbe tax out of our
own pockets." There are bank assess
ments and methods of making up the roll,
the treatment of delinquents and scores of
other matters to be considered.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion and order of business met in tbe office
of Assessor Berkey of Sacramento, Spitzer
being selected as chairman aud Herzer of
oan Franchco secretary. A number of
resolutions were drafted, to be presented
to the convention to-morrow. Among
these was a resolution to declare the tem
porary officer j permanent; another the
election of a vice chairman and assistant
secretary, and a Una nee committee to
consist of three members, and a recom
mendation that the convention be de
clared a permanent fixture, to convene
every two years, with an appropriate act
to be drafted and presented to tbe coming
Legislature, making it incumbent that all
Assessors attend the convention.
It was al-o recommended that three
committees be appointed, one on banks
and banking, to be empowered to inquire
and report on the subject of assessing
national banks stock. This committee
will also probably recommend that all
State banks be required to make out a
statement of their assets and liabilities on
lhe Ist of March, and forward a copy to
the Assessors as well as to the Bank Com
missioners.
The second committee is to be known as
the revision committee, and the third as
the new legislation committee.
It wag agreed tbat all of these resolu
tions be submitted to the convention in
writing, and after lengthy discussions on
various subjects the committee adjourned.
ENDS LIFE ON THE DESERT.
Suicide of a Weary Traveler Near Yuma
by Jumping Into the Colorado
River.
SaN DIEGO, Cax., Nov. 23â Joe Carter,
the well-known trapper and guide of the
Colorado desert, was on his way to Yuma
last Friday from Hall Hanlon's, south
west of that place, when, on rounding a
pile of bowlders on the road, he was horri
fied to see a man a short distance ahead
with only his back visible bending over
and hacking at his throat with a short
kn.fe. Blood was streaming down over
hi 3 wrist to the ground. The stranger ap
peared to be about 5 feet 6 inches in height,
of dark complexion and with a dark mus
tache. Jagged rents were visible at the
side of his throat.
Carter hurried forward and drew his re
volver with the words, "Drop tbat knife,
or I'il put a hole through you." The man
looked up in a dared manner, and an
effort on his part to speak resulted in oniy
a raspinr noise that was unintelligible.
Carter hurried to the cyanide plant of Mr.
Lnce, and securing tbe assistance of Luce's
son they returned as fast as possible to
the spot where the would-be suicide had
been leit. He was not to be eeeu. how
ever, and the closest search in the vicinity
failed to disclose his whereabouts.
Carter and three Indian trailers spent
the greater part of the remainder of the
day searching for the man, but although
his tracks could be traced in the imme
diate vicinity, as they led here and tnere
in a zigzag manner, the man could not be
found. The only solution of his remarka
ble disappearance was that the man
jumped into the Colorado River a short
distance away, and thus ended an exist
ence that was evidently irksome. A man
answering the description of the one
seen by Carter was seen tbe previous day
at the Lagr ranch, below Yuma. No clew
to his identity can be given.
FRESNO'S JUDICIAL MIX-UP
Doubt a* .to,. Whether < .- Judge Church
totally Holds Office.
FRESNO, Cal., Nov. 23.â George E.
Church, who was elected without opposi
tion at the recent election to serve the un
expired term of Superior Judge 6. A.
Holmes, deceased, qualified to-day and
will open . court to-morrow morning.
Judge Stan ton L. Carter, who was an
pointed by Governor Markham nearly two
years ago upon the death of Judge Holmes
to serve until a successor could be elected,
stepped down and , out to give way to
Judge Church. Judge Church will have
only i_ five weeks to serve, however, as the
term of the judgeshio expires in January
and : the last Legislature . passed an act
abolishing it at that time.
There are some â among them Judge
Carterâ who think that when Mr. Church \
qualified for the judgesblp it was abol- '
ished according to the act passed by the
Legislature. The law. reads that which
ever of the three courts of which the
term shall first expire shall be abolished.
It is claimed that when Judge Carter's
term expired, which was upon the quali
fication of Mr. Church, the judgeship was
therefore abolished. . -. v
In order that no complications might
result Judge Carter transferred all the
cases before him to the other two depart
ments, so that Judge Church would have
no business, it is said that the personal
feeling existing between the two men was
in great part the cause of these transfers.
This afternoon Judge Kisley transferred
one of his cases to Judge Church's court.

SEATTLE'S COSTLY
WATER SYSTEM
Plant Bought by the City
Found to Be Heavily
Incumbered.
Californians Hold Bonds Worth
a Third of a Million
Dollars.
Were Believed to Have Been Taken
Up Before the Property Was
Acquired.
SEATTLE, Wash-. Nov. 23.âCaiifor
cians who bold $50,000 worth of bonds of
the Spring Hill Water Company, a corpo
ration which in years gone by did a big
business in this city, sprang a sensation
to-day when they gave the city of Seattle
notice that the bonds are now due and
owing and that they have a trust deed to
the city's water plant to secure them.
To-night the City Council discussed the
matter, but was unable to reach any con
clusions, and what the outcome wiil be it
is difficult to say. The Californians hold
another issue of tbe Spring Hill Com
pany's bonds, amounting to $250,000.
These do not fall due until 1908. but when
tbat time arrives it ia expected that they
will call on the city to pay them also.
The Californians who hold the $50,000
issue and who created the sensation today
by demanding payment are Myer Lewis,
Hattie Heller, Leopold Uachman, E. and
S. Heller and Herman Alexander. Lewis
holds $20,000 worth of the bonds, being the
heaviest involved. The city supposed that
these bonds had been taken care of by the
Spring Hill Company.
Tne water snpply of Seattle was origin
ally controlled by several gentlemen
known as the "Spring Hill Water Com
pany." To increase its facilities as the
city urew the company in 1886 bonded tbe
property for $50,000, issuing ten-year
bonds and making the Puget Sound' Na
tional Bank trustees of the property to
secure the issue. On May I, ISBB, a second
issue of bonds was made, amounting to
$250,000 and running lor twenty years.
T ese bonds are still out and unmatured.
This made an aggregated indebtedness of
$300,000.
In October. 1890, the Spring Hill Water
Company sold its entire plant to the city
of Seattle for $352,265 67, executing to the
city a warranty deed of all its property,
which of course conveyed the property
"free and clear of all incumbrances."
Nevertheless these trust deeds were still
out, and the bonds were unpaid and un
canceled. The h'rst issue of bonds was
sola in California. They fell due on No
vember I, 1896, and demand was made on
the Spring Hill Water Company for pay
ment, but refused. Now the bondholders
in California have served notice on the
city, the iawiul ownersbf the equity of the
water company's property, asking that
tbe same be paid.
The transaction whereby the city ac
cepted this property and paid out over
$362,000 while these trust deeds were still
uncanceled shows a laxity on tne part of
the city officials of 1890 scarcely paralleled
in -the history of municipal purchases. It
Is claimed by the city that when it bought
the company's water plant the under
standing was that the company should
take care of the bonds. But there was
not, it is said, any written contract, ana
the Spring Hill Company ia now defunct.
The president and vice-president are dead.
Jacob Furth, president of the Puget Sound
National Bank, said to-day that the com
pany would take care of the bonds, but
the fact remains tbat the demand for
$50,000 has been made and refused.
The bondholders have trust deeds on the
plant now owned by the city, anu the be
lief is that the city, before it can get a
good title to the plant, will have to pay,
in addition to th j sum already paid.
$00,000 for the one bond issue and"s2so,ooo
for the issue falling due in 1908.
All day lone the city officials have been
in consultation over the matter, but to
night they admit they are still at sea.

' These are all different? ways of describ-

Stanford Men at Congress
Springs Are Kept
Indoors.
Light Exercise and Rehearsing
of Signals Will End the
Training.
. Students at Palo Alto Confident That
Berkeley Wi 1 Be De
feated.
CONGRESS SPRINGS, Cal., Nov. 22.â
To-day was put in very quietly by most of
Stanford player?. Some studied aud some
' read, while a few braved tne rain and
. 5-tarted out aa.ong the hills. If the
â¢- weather bad been pleasant all the men
would have taken a tramp in the moun
tains, as that was the plan.
Yesterday was a busy day for the play
ers. An hour and a half in the forenoon
was devoted to signal practice and in the
afternoon the men lined up for thirty
minutes' hard playing, the last of the
.season until the match with Berkeley.
f The rest of the time from now on will be
r devoted exclusively to light practice and
\ â¢ signal work.
Considering the condition of the field
ths practice was fair. Burnett '00 took
Fickert's p. ace temporarily at guard and
distinguished himself by getting into
every play and tackling all over the field.
â¢ . During the second half of tiie practice
''. , came he was tried at tackle and continued
his work there. Tross says that if a week
" or two remained before the game Burnett
would certainly force one of the other
Varsity players to surrender his position.
The greatest misfortune since the team
arrive! here is the severe injuring of
\V. A. Hurrini.'ton, Varsity left tackle.
V. ,-Jlis accident will make it impossible for
.lumto play on Thanksgiving and J. B.
' Rice '97 has been substituted. Rice has
[ â¢ been putting up a very strong game up
! iiere â stronger than at any previous time
â¢ this season. He has also developed greater
"speed and aggressiveness.

X.l Cojtton is playing his usual good game at

of the absolute stillness which prevails

: season caused tne utmost rc-joiciDg. Â£n
â â â  thusiasts feel more and more confident
*â¢ that Berkeley's boast of a few weeks ago
.. that Stanford wouldn't be in it will prove
â¢a most distressing disappointment to the
â â boasters.
.: It is calculated by those here who think
they Know something of the two teams
â¢that Berkeley wiil be outclassed in the
line. Simpson, the Berkeley tackle, will
fin-d his hands full with C. Thomas, who is
V an aggressive player and especially strong
. . ;*t stopping any attacks en masÂ«e on his
} '.position. In case Jack Rice takes Har
â¢" . rinpton's place, his lighter weight is a dis
. . advantage, but no man more thoroughly
understands the work of a tackle than
. Rice or uses his weight and his unusual
strength to better advantage. He tackles
â¢ much better than Harrington, but is not
. -so strong a runner with the ball nor so
effective in interfering.
The ends of the two universities are
probably evenly matched and Berkelpy
â¢ has' the advantage back of the line.
Whether that advantage is as great as her
ad"mirers think remains to be seen. One
â¢ ' thine is certain, in backing qualities the
â¢ "Berkeley backs are no better, and if they
â¢ excel at any other point, it must be in
end running, in tackling and in punting.
â  any of the Stanford backs be laid
. oft', they could be replaced almost without
exception by playerÃ who are but slightly
- 'their inferiors.
. " College songs and college yells are taking
up the evenings now. After the evening
meal the students gather in thedormitory
to practice songs and yelling lor an hour
or so. Some of the yells this year should
-be most effective.
RAIN DAUNTO THEN NOY
Jierkelejf Football Men Practice in the
Â§j?SÂ§ Muddy Street.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 23. â The
' â¢ Berkeley football men are practicing for
â¢ their Thanksgiving game with Stanford
.. â¢ ' rain or shine, and will continue to do so
up to the very last moment. Notwith
. â¢ "standing the torrent which fell all after
â¢ noon and the wet and slippery condition
â¢ ".: of the ground the Varsity eleven came out
Â° ; and went through a seVies of evolutions
:.with the ball which extended over an
-.iio'ur. The practice field being *o very
..muddy the roadway to the rear of Nortn
â â â  and South halls was selected for their
: jnaneuvers.
: . .T"he heavy pounding work of the season
; â 'Having already been finished, the men de
". ':voted themselves to sharp, snappy signal
â¢ practice, and to the perfecting of several
. .new plays which will be sprung on the
â  Palo Alto men in the intercollegiate. The
players seeme<l to put enough energy and
.dash into their work, but the inattention
...to. signals was a marked defect in their
iplay. On account of his not making the
play as indicated by the signal, Captain
â¢-.Ransome received an ugly gash over the
right eye by colliding with one of the men
.in.front of him. While the wound will not
; disqualify him from playing in the
. Thanksgiving game, it will be a source of
"â¢ ."much discomforture to the great fullback,
' and will probabiy prevent nim from do
â¢ ing as effective kicking as he might under
other circumstances.
; ' .Eddie Sherman was not well enough to
practice this evening, and Whipple was
â¢ .put in- his place at half.
â  * Almost at the last moment fortune
seems to have turned against Berkeley,
o for both of her star players â Sherman and
. Ransome â have had their injuries and
ailments redoubled, and, though both will
enter the game, they will not by any
means be up to their normal form. The
disabling of some of the best men on the
. team almost on the very eve of battle has
. ever been Berkeley's misfortune, for it
â¢.h.appened last year and the year before
â¢_ krid still the year before that.
Though it will not be definitely known
.â¢ until a lew hours before the great game
.who will constitute the team, yet from a
: Study of the men and their ability a rea-
V sonably accurate conclusion can be
â¢reached. The following men lined up to
day on the Varsity eleven, all of whom
wi] probably play in the team, excepting
Whippie and Wallthail. some doubt ex
isting aa to the putting in of the latter on
account of his comparatively poor condi
no": Center, Carr; guards, Wallthail
â¢ud Greisbergi tackles. Ludlow and
Simpson; <>nds, McNutt and Craig; quar
ter. Kennedy; halves, Whippie and Hall;
full, Ransome.
Whippie was taking Sherman's place at
half, on account of the temporary indis
position of the latter.
A big rally of students will be held on
Wednesday night in front of the training
quarters, similar to the one held last sea
son, at which songs will be sung, yells
will be practiced and a general send off
will be given the boys.
PORTLAND'S POLYGAMY CASE.
Romance Back of a Suit Brought by a
Man Against His Wife and Her
Former Husband.
PORTLAND, Ob.. Nov. 23.-A some
what romantic story of the supposed dead
returning to life again came to light in
Justice McDevitt'i court to-day when
Henry Doidge of Woodburn Woodlawn
caused the arrest of his wife and her
former husband, T. Stephenson, on a
charge of polygamy. A curious combina
tion of circumstances will be unfolded
when the tale is told in court to-morrow.
Henry Doidge, the complaining witness
and husband of the woman, Mrs. S. R.
Doidge, wants to know who his wife's
rightful husband is. According to her
story she has been Henry Doid^e's wife
for nearly twenty years, supposing all the
time that her first mate, Stephenson, was
dead.
Twenty years ago Mrs. Doidge was Mrs.
Stephenson. Siephen^on was in poor cir
cumstance? and he decided to go to Texas
to make his fortune. Husband and wife
corresponded resularly for a while. He
fell ill among strangers and in course of
time, hearing nothing niore of him, Mrs.
Stephenson believed him dead. From
that day husband and wife were lost to
one another. Finally Stephenson drifted
back to the north and went to work on the
Astoria-Goble Railroad.
One day a woman came to the camp to
cook for the railroad nands. She formed
Stephenaon's acquaintance and told him a
story of the wrongs and abuse inflicted
upon her by Doidge, who, she said, neither
supported herself nor her six children.
This woman was his first wife. Stephen
son came to Portland and began to pro
vide for his former wife and children.
Doidge could not be expected to like this
state of affairs very well, and so he had
both of them arrested, partly because of
resentment at his wife's former husband
assuming to provide for his neglected
family, and because, also, he would like to
know whose claim is valid.
WORKING FOR SAN PEDRO.
Los Angeles Citizens Attach Their Signa-
tures to a Petition for a Free
Harbor.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Nov. 23.â Ever
since word name from New York that C,
P. Huntington had a conference with the
National Harbor Commission the free
harborites here have been on nettles.
Prominent business men, who believe San
Pedro is the proper site for the deep-sea
harbor, got together several days ago and
decided that something had to be done to
checkmate Huntington 's scheme. Chief
Engineer Hood's temporary presence here
added to the uneasiness atid spurred the
friends of San Pedro to action.
Accordingly a petition in favor of San
Pedro, because of its natural advantages
and accessibility, was started in circula- '
tion this morning. Nearly all the promi- j
nent wholesalers and shippers signed it
without a murmur. Oniy about a half- !
dozen refusals were met with, the dissent- j
ers being avowed Santa Monica men. Tne '
circulators of the petition at first moved!
with the greatest secrecy, but after they
encountered a few Santa Monica adher
ents the cat was soon out of the bag. It
is understood that the petit. on is not to be '
presented to the commission unless it be- !
comes manifest that Huntineton has been â 
trying to exercise undue influence to de- j
lude the commissioners with the idea that i
the majority of the business men here !
favor Santa Monica.
TRAGEDY AT VENTURA
William Green Wound* Antone Klrment
and Kills Himself.
VENTURA, Cal., Nov. 23â William
Green, a tailor, shot Antone Klement, his
employer, inflicting an ugly wound, and
then put a bullet through his own brain,
dying in less than an hour. The tragedy
occurred in Klement's tailor-shop this
morning at 11 :30 o'clock. Green had been
working for Klement for nearly two years.
He had some trouble with Klement about
taking goods from the shop. The two men
were alone when the shooting took place.
Green fired three shots, two at Klement,
one taking effect in the left cheek and
coming out under the jaw. He then put
the revolver in his own mouth and nulled
the trigger. Klement is not dangerously
hurt, but has a bad wound. Green was
about 25 years old and a native of Rou
mania.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1896.
The Old Steamer Emma in Saturday's Storm and the New Emma That "Will Be Ready for Business
Next March. The New Boat Will Have Her "Wheel Amidships and on the Lower Deck
Will Have Space for Twenty-Six Teams. She Is Expected to Make at Least J2 Knots.

AND THE NEW ONE
One Was in the Gale Satur

Is in Embryo.
With Her Propeller Amidshi

a Sensation.
More S. earners Are Wanted on the
Stockton Route to Carry Valley
Road Freight.
question as to the date of the heavi
lest southeaster that has made trouble on
I the bay during the past week ha- often
arisen. In regard to the matter the ferry
boat captains seem to be in doubt. Some
say it was last Thursday and others assert
that last Saturday was the roughest occa
sion on which any of the boats have had to
cross the bay. Captain Johnson of the
steamer Emma says that never in his
experience did he see as heavy a sea as
then raged on the bay. During her last
trip from Oakland Creelt to San Francisco
the little stern-wheeler was almost en
j gulfed, and one of Piper, Aden, Goodall <fe
j Co. '3 schooners appeared in the distance
I as though she was going out of sight.
Chief Engineer Roland of the Emma is
j an old-timer on the Stockton route, but
! nevertheless the weather was too much
j ior him, and, stranee to say, be was sea
sick. Yesterday he was explaining to
his friends that it was a case of bilious
ness, but all and sundry accepted the expla
nation with a credulous smile. Roland it
an old-timer, but when the Emma struck
the heavy swell that came in from the sea
he had to cry "peccavi," and the first as
| sistant took his place. Roland is certain
I that never in the history of the bay has
â¢ such a heavy sea prevailed as that which
j rolled in last Saturday night.
The old stern-wheeler will not remain
on the Oakland route many months. A
new Emma is to take her place, and she is
expected to make at least twelve knots an
hour. The new boat is a departure from
the style of craft now plying on the Stock
ton and Sacramento route, and, in fact,
will be the only vessel of her class in the
world outside of those plying on the
Mississippi. Her propeller will be amid
ships, and when completed she will be one
of the strongest vessels in the bay. The
present Emma with a southeaster almost I
rolling her gunwales under and the new
Emma with her wheel amiuship make a
pretty picture of the past and the present.
Many moons ago Chief Engineer Ro
land, then of the Stockton boat T. C.
Walker, A. B. Darrell of the Stockton
steamer J. D. Peters and P. A. Johnson,
cantain of the Daisy Kimball, combined
and started an opposition freight boat to
Alameda. The new boat was the old
Emma, and for three years they have
kept up the tight and made a living. Now
business has improved to such an extent
that a new Emma is required and the ves
sel is to be built at once.
"How can I explain the plan on which
ttie|new vessel is to be buili?" said Chief
Engineer Roland yesterday. ' 'There is
the model and ;rom it you can see what
we expect to make. The propeller will be
amidships and will not take up more room
than the walking-beam on a ferry steamer.
"Just imagine two separate ships joined
together. They lie side by side, and there
is of course considerable space between
the two halls. Make those two hulls tast
toeether and put a big paddle-wheel in the
intervening space and then you have an
idea of the new boat.
"It our idea be correct, and we are all
old Mississippi men, the new boat should
make about twelve knots an hour, and
thus beat any Southern Pacific boat on
the bay. She will be 150 feet long. 42 feet
broud on the floor and 44 feet beam, and
10 feet deep.
The old Emma is only 85 feet long, 22
feet 6 inches broad and 4 feet 7 inches
deep. We expect to have the new Emma
running on the route between thefoot of
Washington street, San Francisco, and the
foot ol Franklin street, Oakland, next
March. In that event we will carry both
passengers and cargo.''
When completed the new Emma will
look like the Piedmont, only she will
have no sidewbeels, and in the place
where is the Oakland's walking-beam
will be a plain, ordinary house, which
will keep the spray thrown up from the
wheel away from the upper deck. When
completed the new steamer will have ac
commodation for at least twenty-six
teams on the lower deck, and all the gen
eral freight that comes along will be put
on the upper deck. Cabin accommodation
will be ample, and when ready for ber
trial trip the new Emma should attract
universal attraction.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamers are having a
bard time of it carrying the Valley road
freight. Hundreds of tons of general
merchandise are left over every night,
and although four steamers are running
where two used to fill the bill, still they
cannot carry all the goods, and in conse
quence the company's towboat has been
pressed into thÂ»Â» service. At the present
time the T. C. Walker, J. D. Peters, Mary
Garratt and the City of Stockton are ruii
ninjr night and day, and latterly the
Leader has been taken off the barge route
and is now carrying cargo for the Valley
road. In consequence the navigation
company is very short oi steamers and
some of the old-timers will ba pulled out
of the slough and put in commission be
fore the month i-> out.
Yesterlav the City of Stockton brought
down 200 tons of wheat for the Generai
Millenet. The ship was not ready to re
ceive it, and even if sbe had been the rain
would have prevented the unloading.
Consequently the Stockton had to go to
the seawall and unload there. Eppinger
& Co. will thus nave to pay double wharf
age, and to say that the head of the firm
was angry does not adequately describe
the scene.
Tne Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Orizaba has more freieht offering than sbe
can carry for Mexican port?. In conse
quence Goodall, Perkins & Co. will put an
extra boat on, and all the Christmas goods
Â«lne in the Gulf of California next month
will get there on time. The chances are
that the Coos Bay will make another run
on the southern route.
Piper, Aden, Goodall Â«fc Co.'s steamer
Sunol has received a thorough overhaul
ing and is again on the Vallejo route.
Chief Engineer Pryor saw to it that her
engines were in thorough repair, and he
is now willing to bet dollars to doughnuts
that the Sunol can beat the Herald twenty
lengths in a straight mile run.
The Spreckels tug Reliance, with her new
"corrugated" propeller, had a brush with
the tug Active last Sunday. John D.
Spreckels was on the Active, so it goes
without saying that both vessels did their
best. The Reliance started about three
boats' lengths behind the Active and beat
her out a boat's length in the run to
Sausaiito.
Iv consequence Mr. Spreckels ordered
one of the new wheels put on the Czarina
as soon as the is ready for it on the dry
dock. The nev wheel takes the water
quicker and makes more revolutions going
astern than any propeller that has yet
been fitted to a tug. Captain "Gill"
Brockaw is enthusiastic in his praise of
the invention, ami says that now the Re
liance can beat any tujc in the bay, either
in speed or towing.
Captain "Pete" Ott, one of the pilots,
reports the loss of the whistle from the
whistling-buoy, and the Lighthouse in
spectors have sent out the following:
Notice to Mariners, San Francisco Bar, Cali
forniaâlt in reported that the whistling buoy
outside San Francisco Bar, California, is not in
working order, the whistle having been
broken. This buoy will be replaced at the
earliest practicable date.
This notice affects the List of Beacons and
Buoys, Pacific Coast, 1895, page 18.
The steamer City of Sydney was to have
sailed lor Central American ports on the
28th inst., but owing to the amount of
freight offering, the date of her departure
has been postponed to December 1. Cap
tain Frank Johnson is more than thank
ful, as he will now be able to thoroughly
digest his Thanksgiving dinner before he
again goes to sea.
IN VOLVES MANY MILLIONS
Beginning of Arguments on a Claim of
Great Magnitude.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 23.â Before
Commissioner of the Laud Office Lamo
reaux to-day began a case which will be
argued during this week, afterward going
before the Secretary of the Interior, and
will finally find its way to the United
States Supreme Court It is the claim on
one side of William H. Cox to about
$10,000,000 or $15,000,000 worth of property
in Chicago, north of the Chicago River to
North avenue and east of tne Hail survey
to the lake, embracing about 163 acres of
land.
Another set of claimants are H. M.
Lafelette and Matthias Bouner, who claim
to be purchasers of scrip issued to the
heirs of Captain W. H. McKee, a veteran
ol the Mexican War, by acts of Congress.
The land is now occupied by railroads,'
business bouses, a canal and about ten
streets, and among those owning improve

SUSIE B. MARTIN
ONCE MORE FREE
A Jury Decides That She Is
Not Insane at
Present
She Killed Her Husband in a Fit
of Temporary Mental
Aberration.
Arguments by Attorneys Eddy and
Hink.eâ Judge Wallace's Charge
and the Verdict.
Mrs. Susie B. Martin, who shot and
killed her husband in the new City Hall
on the 30th of last March, and who was
acquitted on the ground of insanity, is at
last a free woman. A jury in Judge Wal
lace's court yesterday declared that she is
not now insane, and she was at once dis
charged from custody.
When Mrs. Martin entered the dark
courtroom yesterday morning sne was
looking more cheerful than at any time
since the day of her arrest, when she
stood over the lifeless foim of her hus
band, John F. Martin, and assured her
captors that she had killed him because
he had left her and she loved him too
much to live without htm.
Ned Fester, a brother-in-law of the ac
cused woman, retold the story of her
miserable life with Martin, how he abused
his affectionate wife and neglected her to
consort with the worst kind of men and
women in a disreputable quarter of the
City.
He thought this had unsettled Mrs.
Martin's mind and that she was not re
sponsible for her act when she shot her
husband. Mr. Foster gave it as his opin
ion that Mrs. Martin is at present of
sound mind and not dangerous to be at
large.
After the testimony for the prosecution
was in, Attorney Kowalsky arose to make
an opening statement for the defense, but
he was checked by Judge Wallace, who
told him his remarks were not properly
framed. When he persisted in his course,
the court ordered him to sit down.
Dennis Boyle, who had charge of Mrs.
M;irtin for some time while she was in the
branch City Jail, said he considered her
perfectly sane. This view was coincided
in by Miss Minnie Boyle, Mrs. Ellen
Boyle, Archie Levy, Mrs. Kitty Tracv
Dr. E. D. Lustier, Dr. C. W. Card, Meyer
Lindheimer and L. G. Busante.
Arguments were made by Attorney
Eddy and Deputy District Attorney
Hinkie. Mr. Eddy said the prosecution
had failed to make out a case, and that
even if he and Mr. Kowalsky had not
promised any affirmative testimony to
show that Mrs. Martin is sane she would
be entitled to a verdict establishing her
sanity. He contended that the testimony
shows conclusively that she is of sound
mind.
Mr. Hinkle took a different view. He
said it had been proved that Mra. Martin
was insane when she fired the fatal shot.
It was on that point an acquittal had been
based. Did she remain insane just long
enough to pull the trigger and kill her
man and then become insane again?
Wouldn't it be fair to presume that she
might go insane that way and kill some
bony else if she felt so disposed, and then
seek another acquittal on the ground of
insanity?
In Mr. Hinkle's opinion the jury ought
to put Mrs. Martin in a place where the
public safety would not be endangered.
Judge Wallace charged the jury to the
effect that when the trial opened the pre
sumption was in favor of Mrs. Martin's
sanity, and that the burden of proof of in
sanity rested upon the District Attorney.
After he introduced the record of the
murder trial and the verdict of the jury
that Mrs. Martin was acquitted because
of her insanity, then the burden of proof
shifted, for the verdict of that jury must
be accepted as true, and ber insanity
must be conceded. Jt therefore devolved
on her to prove by a preponderance of
testimony thxt she has recovered her men
tal balance and is at the present time in
a sane condition.
The jury took half an hour to agree on
a verdict, but finally decided that Mrs.
Martin is of sound mind.
When discharged from custody Mrs.
Martin received the congratulations of
her friends in a quiet manner, and at once
left the courtroom with her sister and
other relatives.
It is stated that Mrs. Martin will resume
her vocation as an actie*s.

NO MORE FUSION
FOR POPULISTS
They Have Renounced the
Works of the
Devil,
And Therefore Are Divorced
From the Bedridden
Democracy.
Other Great Issues Besides Finance
That the Bourbons Cannot Handle
to Any Practical Advantage.
The executive committee of the State
Central Committee of the People's party
held a secret session in the State House
in Sacramento last week to bury the dead,
to care for the wounded, aud to discover
what it was that had knocked the party
and its Democratic rider to smithereens.
The situation was exhaustively dis
cussed by the gentlemen present, namely;
E. M. Wardall, chairman; R. E. Bush,
secretary; S. C. Houghton, Assemblyman
elect from Tehama and Trinity counties;
C. A. Barlow, Congressman-elect from the
Sixth District; T. V. Cator, M. E. Dittmar
of Redding, J. S. Barbes of Los Angeles,
L. M. Landsboroueh and J. E. Camp of
Sacramento.
But one opinion was expressed, and that
was that the People's party had gone and
made a fool of itself by marrying tne relict
of the Democracy ; that many of the so
called Democratic newspapers of the
State bad not made a faithful and sincere
tight for the fusion candidates for the
Legislature, and ti.at the People's party
and its principles had suffered rather than
gained by reason of tne political miscege
nation during the recent election cam
paign.
It was decided to issue a manifesto to
the members of the party throughout the
State. In order that the executive com
mittee might test the statement that the
San Francisco Examiner was not sincere
in its pretended tight for the fusion candi
dates, a copy of the manifesto was sent to
that peculiar paper, and, as had been ex
pected, the Examiner refused to publish
it.
The following is the manifesto:
To the People's Party of the State of Califor
nia: Our party sprang into existence a child
of necessity, it will remain the champion of
our demands on the great questions of finance,
transportation and land until the reforms we
advocate shall have been prosecuted to a suc
cessful issue and the (treat strnggle now pend
ing becomes a matter of history.
The great campaign just closed has suc
ceeded apparently ia crushing out hope in the
heart of the people. The success is more ap
parent than real, for a policy that menaces
human liberty cannot be permanently sus
tained in a land where liberty is an inborn
right. Bunker Hill had its Yorktown and
Bull Run its Appomattox. So surely as right
will finally prevail, so surely will the cause of
humanity be eventually sustained at the bal
lot-box. It therefore becomes a positive dnty
to close ranks, align ourselves anew and be
prepared not alone to check luture onslaugnt,
designed to further entrench class privileges,
but to take the aggressive in the struggle that
has for its final object a broader recognition of
the brotherhood ot man.
The object of the People's party was not ac
complished when one of .ts demands was made
the cardinal principle of another great party.
Great as is the silver question, it is not as
great as the whole money questionâ a question
that involves the abolition of the bank of issue
and the establishment of a postal savings
bank. Great as is the money question in its
entirety, it does not overshadow the issue that
involves Government ownership of our trans
portation monopolies, direct legislation and
the destruction of land monopoly.
These demands are all near and dear to
Populists; and while one oi the great issues
that we have contested for this campaign was
not accepted at this time, if we do our whole
duty not alone will monetary reform be car
ried to a successful issue in the next cam
paign, but other demands will also receive the
favorable consideration that their merits will
command.
Our party in 1896, by reason of the action of
the Chicago convention, lelt it a duty to re
spond to tne demand that we support William
J. Bryan and unite all reform forces in an
effort to defeat the gold power. We cannot
complain of the action of our National con
vention.
By fraternizing for this campaign with the
silver forces we have widely extended a knowl
edge of and belief in our principles. We have
also, by honestly supporting Mr. Bryan, placed
the Democratic party in & position where it
cannot attribute defeat to our party. It is
now plainly seen that the reason the Demo
cratic party did not succeed was because that
party could not be held" together in a contest
against plutocracy. We have done our whole
patriotic duty in the demand for our alliance,
and the event proving that Democrats cannot
attract Republicans in sufficient numbers to
fill the gap made by the wide desertion of gold
Democrat!.
We are forced to conclude that the future
maintenance of a National struggle for relief
against Republican plutocracy requires a com
pact organization within our party of all who
would rescue the Nation from industrial ruin.
To the end that there may be harmony in
our policy and purpose and uniformity in the
action of the party in the several States, we
request that the National Committee call a
National convention of our party lor such pur
pose, to be held before April, 1898.
In the meantime let us begin the next cam
paign now. ready to accept any aid that is
offered with an honest motive to accomplish
our objectâ the amelioration of the condition
of the wealth creators of this land.
With unlagging zeal every voter who holds
allegiance to the People's party should at
once gira his loins and face the foe. An or
eamzation that will command the respect will
also command the support of the people. We
will command the one and achieve the other.
What the future may have in store for the
country in the way of political alignment none
can foretell. In the meantime I*. will be the
purpose of the young political giantâ the
party of the peopleâ to organize and educate
nationally, State and local, all along the line,
to the end that none in a receptive mood can
go astray through lack of opportunity because
of the inactivity of those charged with the
duty of directing the forces.
With courage and hope inscribed upon our
banners we will press forward battling for the
right, knowing that truth is mighty and will
prevail.
J. L. Gilbert (chairman), M. E. Dittmar (sec
retary), Thomas V. Cator, C. A. Barlow, C. H.
Castle.

United States and Cuba,
SECRETARY MORTON'S REPORT.
The advance information given of the
annual report of Secretary Morton shows
that he covers a large variety of subjects,
some of which are of value to our farmers
and others are no more than a restatement
of his well-known opinions in favor of the
gold standard and free trade. It will be
left for the people themselves to gather
from the report all which concerns them
and throw the political passages to tbe
waste basket.
The first subject of Importance in the
report is that calling attention to the need
of a scientific director in charge of the
Bureau of Scientific Investigations, who
shall serve as acting Secretary of Agricul
ture in case of the absence of both the
Secretary and Assistant Secretary. Mr.
Morton recommends further that the
chiefs of the scientific bureaus should
have larger compensation, iuasmucn as
they do most of the actual thinking and
reasoning for tbe department.
The Secretary urges that Government
inspection should be extended to all
animals intended lor human food, whether
for consumption in the United States or
abroad. This recommendation is in line
with the growing public sentiment in
favor of pure food laws, and will, no
doubt, receive cordial support from the
people generally.
With reference to our foreign trade in
meats, attention is called to the fact that
wbile reports from abroad show that
American cattle and beef are well received
in England, our packers are not partici
pating in the profits of the growtn in the
consumption of hog products in Great
Britain as they should. Danish and
Canadian packers are increasing their
shipments every year, while the Ameri
cans are comparatively remaining station
ary. This condition of trade is attributed
to the fact that the American pork pack
ers do not cure their meats to suit the
British demand.
One of the notable features of the report
is the showing made of the rapid increase
in the export of American horses to Eng
land. The report says: In 1893 Great
Britain took 13,573 American horses, near
ly 23,000 in 1894 and 34,000 in 1805. but dur
ing the first nine months of 1896 more
American horses were .shipped into Eng
land than in any previous twelve months.
The remainder of the message is largely
taken tip by the Secretary in fighting his
political battles over again. He renews
his old controversy with Congress on the
subject of the free distribution of seed.
He points out that during the present j
fiscal year enough free seed was sent out
to plant 115 square miles of garden, that
each Congressman received enough to
plant over 163 acres, and that the cost of |
carrying the seed through tho mails re- I
quired an outlay from the Government of
over $70,000.
After reviewing the condition of farm I
mortgages and the rates of interest on [
farm lands, the Secretary concludes the I
American farmer is not so badly off as has j
been represented. With the moat favor
able conditions for varied and success
ful agriculture and the lightest burden of |
National taxation, what country, be asks, I
can compete with this in developing the j
best resources of human toil with the
minimum of human effort.
AERIAL NAVIGATION.
The manner in which the Sacramento
story of an aerial ship has been received
strikingly illustrates the condition of tbe
public mind in regard to the possibility
of an early accomplishment of success in
navigating the air. The story came upon
us so unexpectedly that comparatively
lew people believed it, and yet the con
sciousness of the great strides that have
been made toward success in this enter
prise was such that very few were found
to declare an absolute skepticism con
cerning it.
It is beyond question that we have been
for some time on the verge of success in
this much sought after system of naviga
tion. The project has long since passed
from the hands of quacks and eccentrics
into those of learned scientists and accom
plished inventors. What has been done
by Maxim, by Langley and by Lilienthal
is sufficient to make it evident that hu
man ingepuity is capable of dealing with
the problem and successfully mastering it.
The strange part of the story from Sac
ramento is that it brings the airship home
to us in California when we were looking
for it in the East or in Europe. Models of
airships have been on exhiDition in nearly
all the great cities of the world and some
of them have shown remarkably good re
sult?. Had the story of the airship come
from London, or even from Chicago, it
would have been much better received.
It was too much of a surprise, however,
for Jhe general public to learn that the
great ship had been built and had sailed
forth from Oroville.
We have in this another illustration of
the old question, "Can any good come out
of Nazareth?" It is hard to believe in an
airship coming from a place where no
body expected so much as a balloon.
Nevertheless, if it proves true and the air
ship shows herself visibly to us all it will
then be remembered it is not the first
time that great discoveries have come
from places whence they were least ex
pected.
It war from the litile obscure village of
Philadelphia, in the wilderness of Penn
sylvania, more than a century ago, that
came the discovery of electricity and tbe
invention of the lightning-rod. It was
from a poor barber-shop in a British vil
lage came the invention which enables sea
captains to determine with accuracy their
exact location upon the ocean at any hour
of the day or night, no matter how far
they may have been drifted from their
course by winds and waves. A hundred
instances of a similar character could ba
cited. If therefore the airship has come
forth from Oroville it will not be an extra
ordinary thing in the history of invention.
THE NAIL TRUST.
The collapse of the nail trust will not be
accounted as an offset to any part of the
revival of industry which began immedi
ately after the announcement of tne elec-
tion of McKinley. On the contrary, it is
one of those failures which tend to pros
perity rather than disaster, and the news
will be well received in all parts of the
country.
The trust was one of the most powerful
and apparently one of the most avaricious
of the time. It undertook to levy tribute
upon every industry that uses nails, and
for a long time was successful in doing so.
Like every other monopoly, however, it
overreached itself at last and raised prices
so high that it defeated its own ends and
failure was inevitable.
The report from Chicago giving an ac
count of tbe failure stated that the last
advance ordered by the trust raised the
price of nails to Western consumers so
high that an immense curtailment of the
demand resulted. In consequence of the
falling off in the demand the trust was
compelled to close up 90 per cent of its
mills and throw its workmen out of em
ployment in order to reduce the output
to tbe limit of the demand. The extent
of the falling off is shown by the fact that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1896.
while the trust had arranged for an out
put of 00,000 ke;;s in August it was able tc
sell only 20,000 kegs, whereas in March,
before the advnnee was made, the output
reached 950,000 kegs and the demand con
tinued good.
In order to maintain the cinch which it
had upon nail consumers, and to prevent
members of the trust from breaking their
agreement, it is said the managers were
compelled to maintain a force of inspec
tors almost as large as the secret service
of the Government. To defray the cost of
this enormous inspection the trust im
posed a tax of $1 50 per keg on all the
nails sold by its members, and then re
bated the difference after the objects
â ought were accomplished.
It is not likely that this trust is much
worse than some others organized on
similar lines and pursuing similar objects.
It is clear, therefore, that in such organi
zations there is an inherent weakness
which sooner or later causes them to col
lapse and relieves the people from the
cinch. Unfortunately, however, the col
lapse does not come until great injury has
been inflicted upon the consuming public.
For that reason we cannot rely altogether
upon the weakness of trusts for our de
fense, and some form of governmental su
pervision is clearly necessary to limit the
injurious effects of such organizations.
TARIFF REVISION.
From the tenor of the discussion con
cerning the possibility of passing the
Dingley bill this winter it seems clear
that such an attempt would not succeed.
The advocates of the measure are few.
The great majority on both sides seem
opposed to any compromise, and it is
probable that nothing will be done to
forestall the action of the coming Congress.
Senator Chandler very clearly expressed
the sentiments of a large number of his
colleagues in saying: "I am opposed to
hurrying through any imperfect tariff
measure. Better take time and pass a
bill that will give general satisfaction."
This view of the case will probably be
adopted by the Republican majority in
Congress when the time comes to take
action on the issue. The need of more
revenue is fully recognized, but there
seems no reason for attempting to pass a
purely revenue bill on compromise lines
this winter, when an extra session of Con
gress could assemble in March and make
a complete and final revision in accord
ance with the principles of protection.
A compromise measure enacted this
winter would be only temporary. It
would change tariff regulations which
now exist and yet would offer nothing
permanent on which merchants could
base their arrangements for trade. An
other change would certainly take place
when the next Congress sets about the
task of establishing a comprehensive pro
tective measuie, and this would make two
changes in the tariff system within the
year. To that extent, therefore, the pas
sage of the bill this winter, even if it were
possible, would be unadvisable.
It is well understood that the country
needs protection to its industries as well
as a revenue for the National treasury.
A protective measure, therefor*, in the
near future is absolutely essential, and a
consideration of that fact seems to be
weakening the popular demand for the
Dingley bill and inclining public senti
ment more and more in favor of an extra
session in March.
WHERE PEOPLE LIVE TO BE OLD.
A German scientist and statistician lim been
looking over tne census report of Europe
and has learned a few things from the records.
He finds among other things that high civili
zation does not promote long life. The Ger
man empire, with a population of 55,000,000,
hss Dut 78 subjects who are more than
100 years old. France, with 40,000,000 people,
has 21ii porsons who have passed their one
hundredth birthday.
England posÂ»esses of centenarians, 146; Ire
land, 578; Scotland, 40; Denmark,?: Belgium,
5; Sweden, 10; Norway, with U. 000,000 In
habitants, 23.
Switzerland cannot boast a sin pie man who is
100 years old. but Spain, with 18,000,000 pop
ulation, has 410.
The most astonishing figures come from the
troublesome and turbulent Balkan peninsula.
Little Servia has 575 persons more than 100
years olU ; Iluumania, 1084; Bulgaria. 3889.
Bulgaria nas a centenarian to every 1000 in
habitants aud holds the international record.
In 1892 alone there died in Bulgaria 350 per
sons of more than 100 years.
In the Balkan peninsula, for instance, a man
Is not considered ou the verge of the grave
when he reaches a round century. This Is be
cause a year or so ago in Servia there were 126
persons between lOti and 115 years, 123 be
tween 115 and 125 years, 18 between 125 and
135,3 between 135 and 140. The (scientist
does not credit the story of tne Russian who
Is said to be 160 yea-s old and, in his opinion,
the oldest man in the world is Bruno Cotrim,
a negro, born in Africa and now a resident of
Rio Janeiro.
The statistician says the oldest woman ia
the world is aged 130, but does not tell where
she lives or wno she is. Perhaps he thought
her unworthy of special mention after the
surprising figures obtained from Servia in re
gard to age. ____^^___^_^^__
THE DINGLEY BILL.
A -t'KM ART OT THK PROVISIONS OF THIS FAMOUS
Document.
New York World.
Most readers have forgotten what the Ding
ley Dill provides. Now that there is a prospect
of its passage a summary of its provisions
seem desirable. It is a temporary revenue
bill. It would expire by Us own terms on
August 1. 1898. What revenue it would yield
it is difficult to say. Mr. Dingley expected
$40,00,000 increase from it; treasury experts
put the gain at a lower figure.
It t ik.'s wool cf all kinds off the free list
and puts upon it a duty six-tenths as great as
that of the McKinley tariff. To the present
duty on woolen goods it makes a like addition.
It does precisely the same for lumber In all
forms. It adds 15 per cent of the McKinley
rates to the present rates in schedules A to N.
including chemicals, earthenware, glass,
metals, manufactures of wood ana metals,
tobicco, agricultural products, wines, spirits,
cotton goods, flax, hemp and jute, silks, pulp,
papers, books and sundries.

"THE CALL" AND THE MINERS.
From the San Francisco City Argus, November 21.
The Call has taken up with its accustomed vigor the matter of securing an in
crease in the Cabinet by appointment of a Secretary of Mines and Mining. The idea
is a most excellent one and ought to meet with the same favor at Washington which
it is finding here. The mining interests of the Pacific Coast owe a large debt of grati
tude to The Call for its earnest and powerful advocacy of this matter, as well as for
the constant and careful attention which has been accorded to the subject of mines
and mining in its columns during the past two years. The journalism which devotes
its daily energies to the encouragement of such industries instead of to the booming
of follies and fakes and fads deserves the largest measure of public support and re
spect. In this particular '-The Call has gone far toward attaining the eminence of an
ideal daily newspaper.

Letters From the People.
TO POPULISTS.
Views of the JUitsouri World on the Duty
of J'opulint*.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: In confirma
tion of the statements made in Thk Call of
this morning on "The End of Fusion," it will
be of interest to all your readers, Republicans,
Democrats and Populists alike, to know the
position taken by the Missouri World, since,
in a large sense, it is perhaps the most truly
representative Populist newspaper in the
Union, having a larger circulation in the
several States than any other newspaper of ita
clsss, owing to the fact that it is a very able
paper, of unusual size, and is publishsd at the
extremely low price of 50 cents a year, and
contains more newu.wiin brief letters from the
people, than any other publication of its kind.
In the issue of November 11 the leading edi
torial was addressed "To Populists." The
spirit of this editorial is quite as notable as its
purport. These are the opening words: "We
ao not call in question the acts of any earnest
Populist in the recent campaign. Whether he
voted the Populist ticket, the Democratic
ticket, the Republican ticket or some other
ticket, or took.no part and did not vote at all,
the honest reformer should not be questioned
by reason of his action on November 3," add
ing that "the action of our National Conven.
tlon at St. Louis was looked upon in different
ways by Populists." Then follows a brief re
view of the political situation at that time.
We are reminded that "the time between the
adjournment of the Democratic convention
aud the assembling of ours was short; excite
ment over the change ot front by the Democrat
ic party was running high; Bryan, the Demo
cratic nominee, was pretty well known as be
ing an advocate of some of the Populist prin
ciples and uot known to oppose any of them.
There was no time for calm and deliberate ac
tion either by the masses o: the Populists or
the delegates. Under these circumstances the
Populist convention nominated Bryan."
Reference is made to "the bulldozing tactics
of Chairman Allen and other unfair means
used in securing the indorsement of the Dem
-1 ocratic nominee," and then we are told that
"as a delegate to the convention the editor of
tne Missouri World voted foi a straight nomi
nation, ana at no time since has be thought
he was wrong in doing so. He had had many
years of experience in the third-party move
ment; had seen the Missouri Democrats check
the advnnee of reform by adopting the plat
i form of the Greenbackers In 1878, and had
> seen them afterward as a unit for Urover
Cleveland after he had proven himself worse
than John Sherman. This Missouri Democratic
policy was being played in our Populist Na
tional Convention, as it appeared to him.
"But, under all the circumstances, the Mis
souri World finally thought it best to support
the nominees of the Populist convention â
Bryan and Watson. A large majority oi the
Populists came to the same conclusion. A
large number, however, demanded a new head
to the ticket, and, failing to get it, they either
wintered their votes or voted some other
ticket. Whatever action Populists took on
November 3 they are certainly wedded to the
People's party, and are willing to march for
ward now that the policy of our National con
vention has seen its course. Those who fa
vored Bryan's indorsement and making the
campaign on one issue did so with the under
standing that the light would be reopened for
the Populist party and its full platform imme
diately after the election."
So far as I know, and I was also a delegate to
the fct. Louis convention, this Is a perfectly
fair and truthful statement by the Missouri
World, and I Delieve that all who have a right
to be known as Populist* so understand it.
But let us hear the conclusion arrived at by
this fair-dealing Populist journal as to the
present attitude of our party toward the move
ment for which it stands:
"Now, with charily for each other and a
sharp eye on the place-hunters, let us unitedly
and vigorously push the grand work of edu
cating the peopleâ not in bimetallism, for the
double specie basis is only a lesser fraud than
the single gold busts, out in the true science
of money; money the creation of law; paper
money, tue mouey of progress and intelligence.
Let us show what a great blessing Government
railroads would be, and how they would cut
the claws of plutocracy. Let light shine upon
the land question. Land monopoly is already
Casting its blight in several partsof tne Union,
and only waits for the time when large bodies
of land will be more profitable than mortgages
to make land monopoly the greatest curie of
the Nation."
Then lollows this stinging sentence: "The
campaign just closed proves that the people
cannot be united under Democratic leader
ship." Probably nine-tenths of the Populists
absolutely agree with that declaration, and
will give an affirmative answer to the question
put by the Missouri World: "Are you ready
to lake uptne tight where it was left off last
year?" Joseph Akbury Johnson.

FINDING A NEW
MERIDIAN HERE
The United States Geodetic
Survey Relocating
Itself.
The Observatory on Lafayette
Park Being Moved to
the Presidio.
Professor Davidson Must Find An
other Building as the 0:d One
Will Be Demolished.
There will soon be a new meridian for
the Pacific Coast and from it all lines of
longitude will be measured and all scien
tific wore of the United States Coast and
Geodetic Survey will have its base. This
much is a certainty from the fact that the
Geodetic Survey Observatory in Lafayette
Park at Laguna and Washington streets
is being moved to the Presidio reserva
tion.
The change has a double significance,
so it is claimed by those who know all
about the matter. So far Professor George
Davidson has entree to the station on tbe
Lafayette Park hill, where he has an
astronomical telescope and other instru
ments in a house of his own within the
Government fence. Now, however, he
may have to find another spot for his
observatory, as the geodetic people are
about to abolish the station. The propo
sition is to raze the Government buildings
and fence' and give back the site to the
City. This will be aone immediately the
new observatory at the Presidio has suf
ficient data to define its exact position.
Ana then Professor Davidson will be left
alone in his little observatory in Lafayette
Park at the mercy of the Supervisors.
The station at the Presidio is finished
and has just been fitted up with necessary
instruments and accommodations for the
observers who have commenced their
scientific work there. The old and new
stations are connected by a telegraph wire,
which unites two transits and break cir
cuit chronometers used in the present
observations to determine the difference
in longitude between the stations. Two
officers are assigned to this work, with
transmitting signals and observing tran
sits.
Just as soon as the longitude of the new
station is determined the old one will be
abandoned, but then the precaution will
be taken to mark its exact site with a stone
monument so it can be used as a scientific
record at any other time. And should the
City hereafter lower the grade then the
monument will be lowered under the di
rection of the proper authorities to the
new surface.
The observatory in Lafayette Park was
established in 1879, and has since been
used as the primary station for telegraphic
longitude and latitude and specific gravity
observation?. From it all other stations
on the Pacific Coast and in tbe Pacific
Ocean have been connected. It had its
bearings directly from Greenwich Observ
atory although in a rather circuitous man
ner. The former observatory on Wash
ington square, established by Professor
Davidson 'in 1867, was connected by tele
graph with Greenwich through the ob-
Bervatory at Harvard University. When
the change was made from Washington
square to the more satisfactory one on La
fayette Park hill a series of observations
were made similar to those now being con
ducted between the latter and the Presidio
station. la this way the Presidio Observ
atory can claim connection with Green
wich.
Tbe instruments in the old station will
soon be moved to the new one. They com
prise a transit instrument for obtaining
time for longitude work, a telescope for
latitude observations, a large sidereal
clock and chronometers for longitade
work, with a break circuit for the chro
nometers. In addition to these Professor
Davidson has his own instruments, in
cluding a large telescope and an observa
tory building, all of which have been at
the service of the Government free af
charge since 1880.
There exists some difference of opinion
regarding the advisability of the change.
Those who have had experience with the
fogs of San Francisco and other climatic
peculiarities of the City claim that it will
not be possible to do the same wort at the
Presidio as on the hill. Professor David
son was asked for his opinion. lie said :
"They cannot make good observations
there. Tbe station is near the end of the
Union-street Railway, in a place where
fog obscures the view. During fifteen
months in 1891 and 1892, while I made
continuous observations on the hill, I
used to see the fog over the Presidio four
or five nights at a time in succession, and
hear the fog siren blowing steadily. In
such a fog it would be impossible to get
an observation. Also, the mixture of hot
and cold air down there beside tha water
will disturb observations."

The Mexican Warâ Constant Reader, Oak
land, Cal. The Mexican War grew out of
the acquisition of Texas by the United
Btates. Texas claimed the Rio Grande
aa her southwestern frontier aud Mexico
insisted on the Nueces River. The United
States supported the position taken by Texas,
and in consequence. of this diplomatic inter
course was broken off between the United-â.
States and Mexico in"1843 and General 'lay- '^*!
lor of, the United States army was ordered Into ]
the disputed ' territory. >In v - obedience to /
further - orders he advanced to the Rio
Grande in the spring of 1840. On April 26
of that year the first blood was shed in
an off my which resulted- in the capture of
United States troops ou tho eastern
side of the Rio Grande. President Polk an
nounced to Consiress that Mexico "had invaded
the territory of the United States and shed
the blood of Tom fellow-citizens on our own
soil." â¢ On the 11th of May Congress declared
that "by the act of Mexico a state of war ex
isted." and authorized the President to call for
50,000 volunteers and voted $10,000,000 for
expenses. In the peace negotiations that fol
lowed the war CaUiornia was ceded to the
United States, as was also Utah, Arizona and
New Mexico,- in consideration of the- United
States paying $15,000,000 ana assuming $3,.
000,000 of unsettled cairns against Mexico,
which was paid by the United States Govern
ment in 185 1.
The Thine .Scared Ofl" by a Doll
A little rubber doll with a whistle ia its
stomach was all that saved the residence
of Frank Steubling, who lives at 1313
Quincy street, from being ransacked by
thieves at an early hour this morning.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Steubling came
to town and bought the little indiarubber
hero and took it home for her three-year
old child. The little girl played with the
article all day long, and last night when
she retired the doli was left lying upon
the floor.
At about 2 o'clock this morning M r Â».
Steubling's son, Jacob, who was sleeping
in the room where the aoll was lying, wa-j
abruptly awakened by a loud whistle. He
jumped up and saw a negro glide hastily
out of the room. He had awakened Mf.
Steubling by stepping upon the whistle in
the doll's stomach. The thief was followed
to the back yard and then chased over thy
commons for several squares, but finally
outwitted his pursuers. Had Mr. Steub
ling not been awakened the thief would
have carried away all the valuables in the
house. He had already packed a basket
with table silverware and had it near the
door. â Louisville Evening Post.

Association, and prominent officials, in
cluding Governor James ri. Budd. The
president of the Board of Health set forth
that the banquet was given as an appreci
ation of the establishment of a fitting

Around the walls of the banquet-room
were large framed sentiments nf the
Board of Health as uttered by resolutions
at regular meetings. One of these read :
The board will see to it that lightâ sunlight,
if possibleâ and pure air shall permeate the
habitation of every human being in San Fran
cisco, and that the dark, damp, foul places be
low and above ground which breed and em

shall do so no longer.
The room was handsomely decorated
and the repa&t an elaborate one. There

ILLEGALLY HELD
IN BROADWAY JAIL
Judge Hunt' s Order for G.
Kentras' Release Not
Honored.
Jailer Dunn Claimed Lack of
Authority to Liberate
the Prisoner.
Friends of the Accused Are Angry
and Will Carry tbe Case to
the Courts.
G. Kentras, arrested a few weeks ago on
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon,
was tiieri before Judge Hunt yesterday
afternoon. The case was closed and the
jury was locked up to deliberate on a ver
dict After an hour or so Judge Hunt was
informed that a verdict could not be
reached. Some were for conviction, some
for acquittal, while others believed the de
fendant guilty of simple assault.
This being the case the Judge dis
charged the jury, and on motion of de
fendant's counsel, J. N. E. Wilson, or
dered the bond, on which Kentras had
been enjoying his liberty while nis case
was pending, removed. This was done.
Deputy Clerk Harry Piper acknowledged
the court's order and affixed the seal.
B. M. Gopchevitch, editor of the Srbin
Amerikanic, a friend of the accused, took
the bond and order of release to tbe
Coontv Jail last evenine at 8 o'clock, but
was disappointed in his endeavor to se
cure his friend's liberty. Deputy Jailer
James Dunn, who was on duty at the
time the order was presented, refused to
release his prisoner.
"I have received orders not to release
any prisoner," sÂ»id Mr. Dunn, "unless the
chief ja:ler or bookkeeper is present."
Expostulations were useless, and Ken
tras' friend was in despair. He was in
formed by the jailer that in case he called
on the Sheriff and he ordered the }>ris
oner's release the order would be obeyed,
but otherwise be would have to respect
his instructions.
Gopchevitch then called on Attorney
Wilson and explained the situation, ami
the latter addressed a note to Sheriff
Wheian requesting Kentras' immediate
release. Gopchevitch, the note in his pos
session, went in search of the Sheriff, out
failing to find him returned to the jail.
Dunn, however, was obdurate and Keniras
was forced to remain in jail twelve hours
longer tban tbe law demanded.
Now the question arises what will be
the outcome of the jailer* refusal to re
lease the prisoner when a legal order of
release is presented to him?
Is the Sheriff liable for false imprison
ment? Is the deputy jailer in contempt
of court, or the man wno issued ths order
commanding jailers to releasÂ« no one un
less the chief jailer or the bookkeeper are
present?
Does the law allow a Sheriff to pass an
order of release issued by a court and obey
it at his pleasure.
The questions will in all probability be
answered before the culmination of the
present case, as the friends ot the impris
oned man intend to carry the matter to
the courts for settlement.
AN OPIUM SEIZURE.
Customs Inspectors Capture a Smuggler,
but Two Others Make Their
1 gcape.
There was an exciting scene on Twelfth
ana West Mission streets between 7 and 8
o'clock last night, in which several cus
toms inspectors and three opium smug
glers participated.
Inspector E. A. Holmes headed a party
of customs officers who were in search of
three smugglers. They came acro-s them
at Twelfth and West Mission streets while
they were apparently making for Brady
street.
As soon as they saw the customs officers
they made a break for liberty, dropping
the sacks and basket they carried.
One of them was seized by the officers
and held. Inspector Holmes fired two
shots at the other two to intimidate them,
but they were not to be intimidated and
made their escape.
The prisoner was taken to the Seven
teentli-street station, where a charge of
having smuggled opium in his possession
was entered ncainst him. He gave the
name of Sam Brown, but as he is a native
of Greece that is believed to be an assumed
name. He positively refused to say any
thing, and pretended not to understand
the English language.
The sacks and telescope-basket con
tained altogether about 200 pounds of
opium.
KICK AND FIGHT.
Indian Football Players May Journey
to the Westâ The Pugilists
The Olympic Clab directors met yester
day and discussed at length a proposition
submitted by Leader Taylor of having the
great Indian football team Journey (o this
City for the purpose of playing a series of
intercollegiato football games. The di
rectors thought very favorably of the
proposition and may possibly arrive at
some definite conclusion at their next
meeting.
The handball tournament is progressing
slowly, but much interest is centered in
the result of the fir.it-class contest.
Superintendent Kennedy is negotiating
with several Eastern pugilists, with the
view of matching George Green, the club's
favorite, against some good man. When
the name of Jack McAuliffe was men
tioned by some member Kennedy smiled
blandly and jocosely remarked that Jack
carries too much weight.
D^n Lynch, iho manager and confiden
tial adviser of Tom Sharkey, when spoken
to last evening concerning the referee who
is to decide the coming contest between
Fitzsimmons and Sharkey, said that he
had not the remotest idea who the man
would be, but that he will have some idea
in a week or so. *
"I am ready to confer with Mr. Julian,"
said Lynch, "at any time that he is pre
pared to talk business in that particular."
In case tlie pugilists cannot decide upon
a referee the club will select some man
from among the sports of this town. Both
fighters are feeling first class, and will be
in good condition to enter tho ring ou the
evening of December 2,
The managers of the Golden West Club
expect a lame crowd to witness the Ryan
and Tracey fight, and Harry Lask, the
club's director-general, will be very much
disappointed if the house is not packed.
It is said that the pugilists are now in
first-class shape and will make a hot fight
from start to finish. They have been in
structed not to talk while they are en
gaged in actual warfare.

MANCHESTER MARTYRS.
T heir Anniverimry Fittingly Celebrated
by St. Patrick's Alliance in Metro-
politan Hall.
In commemoration of the anniversary
of the Manchester martyrsâ Allen, Lar
kin and O'Brienâ Unity Alliance No. 14,
St. Patrick's Alliance of America, held
appropriate musical and literary exercises
last night in Metropolitan Hall.
The Alliance is purely a fraternal
and benevolent organization. It has
been eataDliÃhed for thirty year*
and is strictly non-sectarian " and
non-political. Robert Emmett(rrotestant)
were he alive to-day could join it, as well
as Daniel O'Conneli (Catholic). Member
ship is open to all Irishmen and thetr
descendants of sound physical condition
between the ages oflÃand4s. Its branches
exist in all the States and Territories of
the Union. It is not oathbound and its
laws require ail members to live up strictly
to the constitution of the United States.
The programme of last night had been
very well arranged and the numbers were
so well sung and played that every one
was persistently encored.
The instrumental selections consisted of
a mertley ol Imn airs on the grand organ
by Miss Marie Giorgiani; a cornet solo,
"Killarney." and Fa ure's "Les Rameaux,"
by M. Grennan; a harp solo, "The Harp
that Once Through Tara's Halls," and a
medley of Irish airs on the piano, by Mrs.
S. J. Tully.
The vocal numbers were "Tbe Last Rose
of Summer " and "Tue Low Backed Car."
by Miss Kitty Black; "The Heart Bowed
Down," by William T. O'Brien; "The
Meeting of the Waters," by Lottie Craw
ford; tenor solo, "The Shamrock," and
"Silent. O Movie, Be the Roar of thy
Waters"; "Kathleen Muvourneen," by
Miss Anita L. Roney and a trio; "Come
Back to Erin," by Miss Kitty Black and
Messrs. D. Manlloyd and G. W. Woods.
The oration by Colonel John O'Byrne,
the hero of 1848, was as flowery as Moore's
description of the Vale of Cashmere and
alive with patriotism.
Colonel O'Byrne j;ave a graphic review
of Ireland's history under British domi
nation, an<J in support of his assertions
quoted liberally from well-known Eng
lish historians. The cruelties of Strong
bow and Cromwell, the devastation and
depopulation of the fairest island in tho
Northern Hemisphere by its English con
querors, as well as the unconquerable
V-atriotihiu and heroism of Ireland's gai
laut sons and duugh:ers, were depicted by
the speaker in a most telling manner.
From these bloody events down to those
of 1793, 1348 and 18U7 the speaker led bia
fasc<nated hearers, and when he had done
they were loth to leave the hall.

THE RESULTS OF
THE CAMPAIGN
Prof. Howison and J. G.
Maguire Tilt at the
Unitarian Dinner.
They Agree That the Contest Is
Probably by No Means
Ended.
Colonel Irish, Senator Perkins and
Others Talkâ A Banquet Attended
by Many People.
Over 100 members of the Unitarian Club
attended the regular quarterly dinner of
the club given last night at the California
Hotel. Warren Olney, the president of
the cluD, occupied the seat at the head of
the board. Hon. John P. Irish and Con
gressman James G. Maguire sat at his
immediate right and Professor G. W.
Howison at his left. The president an
nounced that at the last dinner tbe cam
paign was discussed, and it now seemed
fitting to discuss the reaults of the cam
paign. He therefore called on Professor
Howison of the State University, a prom
inent gold man, to open the discussion.
The profe>sor was not long in coming to
points of issue. He told of the earnest
work that had been done in the campaign
and added that the right had triumphed,
at least he so believed.
"Tue truth is, :> said the professor, "that
j we have probably passed through the
i greatest crisis in the history of our coun
j try. But as a student of human affairs I
cannot share the opinion of the New York
I Nation that we have buried free silver out
;oi sight. I sincerely wish we have, but I
: am afraid not."
President Olney said that at the previ
ous dinner it had been found that titere
were seventy gold men and seven silver
men present. Among the silver advocates
; he spoke of Congres-man James G. Ma
guire as an honevt, able and conscientious
| gentleman, whom many men of opposite
i political faith supported. He called on
mm fora speech. Congressman Maguire
I made a happy introduction and then said : I
"The money question was not the great |
: issue of the enmpaign. I do agree with ]
Professor Howison that the campaign is
not over. Both the leading parties are
â  pledged to the free and unlimited coinage
of both gold and silver. The one which
j pronounced for gold received but the
merest frÂ«^ tion of the votes ofj the United
States. What is 'sound money?' Forty
seven cents of the silver dollar we now \
have is fiat. The proposition of the D-Â»moc- j
racy was to restore the value of silver."
Colonel John P. Irish, Senator Perkins, !
Dr. Stebbins and other speakers followed, j

WHY DID NOT SHERIDAN EISE?
No Plausible Reasoi} for His licing
Kept Out of the Cabinet,
The case of Sheridan, as we now have it
before us, appears to give some additional
pungency to the question how it was that
he did not rise higher upon the ladder of
official preferment. I remember convers
ing forty or more years ago with Lord
Lansdowne (the Lord Henry Petty of All
the Talents) on the subject of the tradi
tional imputation on the Whigs that they
would allow no one to enter the Cabinet
unless qualified by some nobility of origin.
I observed that tbe name of Burke was
tbe mainstay of the imputation.
Lord Lansdowne replied tual Burke was
an impossible colleague in a Cabinet, by
reason of his fractious and ungovernable
temper. But there was no mention of toe
case of Sheridan, who presented, together
with Fox and Lord North, an example of
gentleness and equability never surpassed
in that best of all schools for temper, the
House of Commons. I urn at a loss to
conceive what, had tbe case of Sheridan
been put to him, would have been Lord
Lansdowne's answer. He was a most fair
minded and appreciative man. Why,
then was Sheridan, who stood so high in
all the great public qualities of a pohti- I
cian, always relegated to a secondary po
sition? Gambling ought not to have dis
qualified him more taan Fox. But, much
to his credit, he never gambled, and he
condemned the abominable practice.
Witu respect to wine, it may be said that
there was nothing in his habits down to
the latest of his opportunities of taking
office (in 1806) which could constitute so
much as a pretext for it. The cause could
not lie in his debts; his trespasses upon
others were trilling in comparison with
the liabilities of otlier foremost men. In
the early days the presence of a Burke
excluded might have been a bar to the
inclusion ol Sheridan in the Cabinet, but
Burke was dead and gone long before the
latest and best of these occasions.
He felt it acutely ; a worse man would
have felt it vengefully. It is no wonder
that, when accepting the office of treas- i
urer to the navy, he should have written
to Fox and said that he accepted it with
out the smallest sense of obligation to
anybody. It is possible tuat bis immer
sion in the affairs of the theater may have
been deemed an objection. But if this was
so, ought he not to have had an oppor
tunity given him of removing the impedi- ,
ment by finding, if he could find them,
means for releasing himself from that con
nection? There is no parallel case in our
political history, and happily, it may now
be assumed with confidence that there
never will be. â Nineteenth Century.
. One I'nit Garden.
Japan is one vast garden, and as you
look over the fields you can imagine that
they are covered with top farms where
children are playing with the laws of na
ture and raising samples of different kinds
of vegetables and grains. Everything is
on a diminutive scale and tbe work is as
tine and accurate as that applied to a cloi
sonne vase. What would an Illinois or an
lowa farmer think of planting his corn,
wheat, oats and barley in bunches and
then, when it is three or four inches nigh,
transplanting every spear of it in rows
about as far about as you can stretch your
fingers? A Japanese farmer weeds his
wheat fields just as a Connecticut" farmer
weeds his onion bed, and cultivates his po
tatoes and barley with as much care as a
Long Island farmer bestows upon his as
paragus or mushrooms or his Mowers.
TO SAVE HALF A
MILLION ON BONDS
Indian War Claims Being
Pressed in the Su
preme Court.
The Interest Is Heavy and
the State Is Largely
Concerned.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald Says
That the Sate May Escape
a Big Loss.
The case of Davis against the State of
California is liable to come soon to a
hearing in the Supreme Court. This is
one of what are known as the Indian war
bond cases, and therefore the Davis case
has a peculiar interest. Eight similar
cases have been instituted under the en
abling act of 1873. The Molineaux and
Bates cases were begun in the Superior
Court in Sacramento County in 1894.
These were the first of the series.
The Superior Court gave judgment in
full for the amounts asKed for. Attorney-
General Fitzgerald argued the Molineaux
case before the Supreme Court, and that
court disallowed the interest by which a
saving in two cases of $24,85140 was ef
fected, which was about three and one
half times the value of the bonds and cou
pons sued upon. Since these two cases
two others have been brousrht, one of
which, is tbe Davis case, for $32,260 face
value and for interest. The other is Scott
against the State for $1600 face valus and
for interest. Judgment was rendered in
conformity with the Molineaux decision
for the face value of the bonds and cou
pons in each case, but judgment for in
terest approximating $125,000 was denied.
The Dans case has been appealed to the
Supreme Court for the purpose of again
testine the question of interest. The face
value of bonds and coupons sued upon in
the cases of Reis, Baldwin, Mea i and
Davis against the State aggregates $80,
-342 17. The cases have been tried and sub
mitted to the court on briefs. The Davis
case has given evidence of being alive
during the past few days.
Concerning these caÂ«es Attorney-Gen
eral Fitzgeral'i wrote recently in an official
publication: "The liability of the State
upon these outstanding bonds and coupons
of 1852 has not been determined. The
question is an extremely close and doubt
ful one. However, should judgment go
against'the State tbe Molineux case must
asain control and judgment can be given
for the face value of the bonds and
coupons only. This will result in another
saving to the State of interest approxi

mating $265,000. It will thus be seen that
the ultimate result of the Molineux de
cision is to save the State about $415,000."

RECEIVES A CALL
TO INDIANAPOLIS
Rev. J. dimming Smith
May Leave Trinity-
Church.
He Has Been With His Present
Congregation for Nine
Y:ars
Presbyterian Pastors Trying to Ar
range lor a Series of R- v.val
Services.
Rev. J. Cumming Smith of Trinity
Presbyterian Church has received a call to
the Tabernacie of Indianapolis, which is
said to be the finest church in Indiana.
The reverend gentleman has not yet de
cided whether he will accept the call, but
it is generally understood that he will
prefer the wider sphere of usefulness
which it offers.
It is only a short time since Rev. J.
Cumming Smith returned from a three
Rev. J. Cumming Smith, Pastor of
Trinity Presbyterian Church.
months' tour in the East, and during his
absence he preached in Indianapolis. A
unanimous telegraphic call from the
Tabernacle reached him here on Satur
day. On Sunday he gathered his elders
together and laid the telegram before
them, stating that he had not yet decided
to accept it.
It is generally understood by members of
the Trinity Church flock that the pastor
will go to Indianapolis, and when ques
tioned on the subject yesterday Mr.
Smith did not deny that .there was a
strong probability of his deciding to go to
. the wider sphere of work. His loss would
be quite a blow to his congregation, as he
has been their pastor for nine years, and
during that time parochial affairs have
worked smoothly and harmoniously.
Eev. J. Gumming Smith is a native of
Toronto, Canada. He graduated at the
Toronto University and for a time held a
professorship there for science and the
dead languapes. Afterward Mr. Smith
came to vi*it his father, who was pastor
of St. John's Presbyterian Church in this
City. He was a licentiate at the time and
secured a call to officiate temporarily at
tne Howard-street Presbyterian Church.
Tha congregation was so pleased with hi s
ministrations that he received a perma
nent call and was ordained in order to
accept it. Three years ago the flock
moved to a new church on Capp street,
which was known as Trinity Presby-
I terian. If Mr. Smith accepts the
I call to Indianapolis he will leave directly
1 after the new year. The Tabernacle is the
; church whioh recently extended a call to
j Rev. Dr. Coyle of Oakland, but after tak
inz Bonie time to deliberate the doctor
declined it.
Rev. Dr. Mattiena read an interesting
paper on the Young People's Christian
Endeavor at the meeting of the Presbyte
rian Ministerial Association yesterday.
He spoke in the highest terms of the con
stitution of the society and of the great |
work whicn it is achieving. In discussing j
the paper Rev. E. H. Jenks said that an
important questi n was the consideration j
I of what the churches could do to get the j
greatest blessing from the convention of j
'97, ami added : "Would it be better to i
have union services or groupings of Chris- j
tian Endaavorers?" Rev. Dr. Miller sug- j
gested pentecostal meetings.
Dr. Mathcna introduced a resolution for
the appointment o.' a committee to confer
with the other evangelical denominations
to inaugurate a series of evangelical re-
Vival services in San Fiancisco on the
linea of those already being held in New j
York. The resolution was carried, and ]
Rev. Dr. Mathena and Rev. E. H. Jenks
were appointed acomroittee of two to con
fer with the pastors of other denomina
tions.
Professor Searby read a paper before the
Congregational .Monday Club on the
service of the sanctuary and its outward
; forms. He did not consider the present
I system of service to be as uplifting a 9 it
j ought to be. For one thing, too much
wa> made of the sermon. The professor j
I suggested more congregational singing
and more responsive readingas means for
making servicesjmore uplifting.
Tne following officers of the Congrega
tional Monday Club were elected yester
day: Rev. L. H. Halock, chairman; Rev.
I J. B. Orr (re-elected), treasurer and secre
tary; executive committee â Rev. W.
Rader, R-.v. G. B. Hatch and Rev. C. R.
Brown.
Rev. Frank K. Baker addressed the
Methodist Episcopal preachers' meeting
on "National Perils." A number of sub
jects for discontent among various classes
of people were alluded to. Drink, pov
erty, anarcny, the worship of mammon
and social evils all received their share of
attention, and The speaker gave a higher j
moral standard as the panacea for most of i
these perils. In the discussion the paper
received a large share of praise from most
of the speakers.
A meeting of the Congregational Church j
Extension Society was held yesterday at
which it was resolved to authorize Rev. j
William Tubb to continue the improve- I
ments at Bethany Congregational Churcn j

Rev. Dr. F. D. Bovard, Rev. Dr. Ketcham
and Rev. G. Hatch, representing the Bap- I
tists, Methodists, Presbyterians and Con
gregationali^ts, respectively, held a meet
ing yesterday afternoon to consider the
best means for stopping pool-selling at
the Emeryville track. No action was !
taken, as the meetmc was merely prelim- i
inary.

HOME OF REFUGE OPEN.
Federation of Women Takes a Little
Arabian Girl as the First
Inmate.
The Federation of Women for Public
Good has just opened the Home of Refuge
at 1057 Golden Gate avenue for ihe tem
porary shelter of destitute women and
children.
The first inmate is a little Arabian girl
known by the name of "Jennie," and the
ladies have already decided that the five
year-old child is a mascot. Jennie was in
a deplorable condition when she was taken
into the home. Almost her only clothing
consisted of a thin cotton frock which was
torn and dirty, and ;he child was gener
ally in a very neglected condition. How
ever, a bath and a new suit of clothes ef
fected a great transformation, and Jennie
has been found to bB such a bright, intelli
gent child that it is the desire of the ex
ecutive board to briim her up in the shel
ter as a mascot. The child's parents
brought her about a year aÂ«o from
Arabia. Soon after reaching this Cily she
was deserted by her mother, ana her
father, who is very ill, is quite unable to
do anything for the child.
At present there are beds in tfoe shelter
for six destitute women or children.
When the place is more fully furnished
there wiK be room for twelve. Mrs. Tru
worthy, the matron, is authorized to take
in women and children who are without
shelter, and though the ladies have not
supplies in hand for very far ahead, they
say that they intend to keep up an active
canvass for ways and means to carry on
the wore.
Municipal Printing Contract.
Robert A. Crothers, editor and proprietor of

prietors of the Report and the members of the
Board of Supervisors in the list ot defendants.
He alleges mat his was the lowest bid and'
that lie is entitled to the contract. A writ of
mandate has been asked for to show why the
contract should not be taken from the Keport
and given to the Bulletin. The hearing is to
be held Defore Judge Murphy on December 4.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1896.
FORBES' HEAD IS
IN THE BASKET
Supervisors Decapitate One
of the Prosecuting
Attorneys.
Mr. King Would Not Assign
Any Reason for the Sud
den Removal.
Special S ssion to Be Held Wednes
day to Investigate a Telephone
Company Bond.
The official head of Charles H. Forbep, |
Prosecuting Attorney of Police Court 1, J
was dropped into the basket at the meet- j
ing of the Board of Supervisors yesterday
without any reason lor the decapitation
being publicly assigned.
The matter came up in the form of a
resolution from Supervisor King, sum
marily dismissing Forbes and filling the
position by the appointment of Thomas
Quigley.
Supervisor Hobbs rose to inquire what
it was all about, saying that he had been
away and knew nothing of the contem
plated removal.
"I don't care to explain," said Super
visor King, "the man next to you will tell
you all about it."
"The man next 1 ' to Mr. Hobbs was Su
pervisor Wagner, who is known to enjoy a
large measure of Mr. King's confidence,
and he leaned over and whispered in Mr.
Hobbs' ear. The Supervisor from the
Eleventh seemed satisfied and there was
no further opposition to the removal.
Mr. King would not tell why he had
caused the removal of a man for whose
appointment he was responsible, but it
was rumored that he had been in a fistic
encounter with Forbes or some of his
friends, over transactions that took place
during the recent campaign, and that he
had rather the worst of the argument. A
few scratches across his right cheek &id a
somewhat lacerated nose gave color to the
report.
Another rumor connected Forbes with
the recent investigation of Head Janitor
Murdock. Whichever surmise is correct
matters not, for Attorney Forbes is among
the "outs."
The bond of the People's Mutual Tele
phone Company to cover damages to pub
lic streets while erecting its poles and lay
ing its conduits was presented and laid
over until Wednesday morning, when a
special meeting will be held to hear the I
City and County Attorney's opinion on I
the document. In the meantime the |
sureties named, who qualify in the sum of '
$10,000 each, will be investigated.
By resolution the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company was instructed to
place telephones in the residences of Po- I
lice Captains Gillen and Spiilane and in i
each oi the new food inspection stations. I
The bond of the same company to cover I
damages to streets while laving under
ground conduits was approved in the sum
of $10,000, with Oliver Eldndge and Wil
liam F. Goad as sureties.
The communication of the Grand Jury
raising objections to the condition in
which the corridors and some of the offices
in tne hall are Kept, and recommending
the immediate dismissal of Head Janitor
Murdock and two of hi-* subordinates, was
referred to the Municipal Buildings Com
mittee.

FOR CITY WAIFS.
Another Meeting to Be Held To-Horrow
at Mm. John Pettee's Resilience.
Objects of the Plan.
Mrs. John Pettee and her friends are
anxious to press forward their plans for
the provision of little homeless City waifs.
A friend of the cause said yesterday:
"The intent of the promoters of the pro
posed Children's Emergency Hospital and
Receiving Home enterprise in connection
with and as an adjunct to the Society for
the .Prevention of Cruelty to Children is to
have a place available at any and all times
where children suffering from disease and
injuries wno may be taken in charge by
the society can be received and given the
necessary medical or surgical treatment
free of charge. In many of the existing
institutions for the care of children it ia
very undesirable to admit such as are
suffering from contagious or even cuta
neous diseases, as no facilities are at hand
for their proper care.
"In others the free wards may be over
crowded and several days must elapse be
fore a new applicant can be admitted, or
a child may be suffering from neglect,
starvation and filth and require careful
nursing and the doors of the established
institutions perforce closed against it on
account of some disease as scarlet fever
racing within their walls.
"It is not the intention to antagonize or
supplant any established hospital or insti
tution. On the contrary it is hoped that
all such will open their doors for the poor,
neglected and distressed little charges of
the society as freely in the future as they
have in the past.
"The prime object of this hospital and
home is to provide proper shelter and care
for all little ones who may be sent from
the society for one or more days until
arrangements can be made for placing
them permanently in some established
hospital or institution.
"With this object in view it is deemed
advisable to secure in some healthy and
central locality a small building which
can be utilized for the purpose.
"We desire to equip this building in the
proper manner, with cots and other neces
sary furniture, a small range, a sufficient
supply of needful drugs, medicines, ban
dages, etc. All this should be placed in
charge of not less than two competent
women, who for the present would be
nurse, housekeeper, cook and matron.
"To accomplish our aim funds are re
quired, and the entertainments given and
to be given by Mrs. John Pettee are for
the purpose of acquiring the needed
amount.
"At a meeting to-morrow at 2505
Leavenworth street the hail and pro
gramme will be decided upon. AH inter
ested in the proposed enterprise are in
vited to attend."
Mrs. Hate's Allowance Decreased.
Jud^e Coffey has signed an order reducing
the family allowance of Mrs. Anais Hale,
widow of the late Joseph P. Hale, from $550 a
month to a month. The application lor
this reduction was made on behalf of Margaret
Ryan and certain creditors of the estate.

FORCED TO STEAL
A Boy Who Ran Away
.From His Home in
â¢â¢â¢ Puehio, Colo.
Ctfar-ges His Stepfather, James
Morrow, With Cruelly
/ Treating Him.
â¢ After Arriving Here He Fell Into
.the Hands of a Criminal and
Was Arrested.
â¢ Curtis Cox, a bright, innocent looking
boy, 15 years of age, as a result of falling
.into the hands of a criminal is now held
. in tbe City Prison on a charge of burglary.
The boy on Sunday afternoon went into
the- fruitstore of Bazbuke & Currie, 38
Market street. He told Currie that he
was hungry and Currie gave him a nickel.
About 6 o'clock that evening the boy re
â¢ turned to the store and stole $4 05 from
the till. In a few minutes he again went
. back to tn_ store and gave Bazbuke the
money he had stolen. Be told Ba.buke
that a man had instigated him to steal the
. money and he had repented.
Bazbuke detained the boy and notified
Policeman C. Donobo*. The boy told the
same story to the policeman and said that
the man had arranged to meet him at the
â¢ ferry at 7 o'clock. Tbe policeman went
with the boy to the ferry and waited for
the man, but he did not turn up. and t c
boy was taken to the Harbor station,
where a charge of petty larceny was booked
against him.
Yesterday Curtis was taken before Judge
JoacbimseD. who, after hearing his Btory,
held him to answer before the Superior
Court in $1000 bonds on the charge of
burglary in the second decree, so tbat he
could be sent to tbe Whittier reformatory.
It is possible that something else will
â¢ .be done with the boy if his story should
prove true. H* has apparently none of
tiie criminal instincts in him.
"I belong to Pueblo, Colo.," he said yes
terday, "and ran away from home on
September 5 owing to the cruelty of my
stepfather, Jim Morrow, who works I ; i a
foundry. He has always treated me cru
elly. He would thrash me and roll me in
. a barrel and often for-days he would give
me nothing but bread and water for my
food. I could not stand it any longer, so j
1 ran away.
"I t?ot on a passenger train and beat my
way to Streator, IU. For v few days I
tried to get work, but failed, and again !
â¢ Beat 'my way bac_ on trains. I stopped)
off at Foit fccott. Kans., for a day and I
then got as far as La Junta, where I
boarded a train tfoin^ this way. 1 got as
lar as Albuquerque, N. Mex.. "where 1 was
thrown off the train. I stayed there for a
hay or two and as I could net nothing to j
eat I stole a toy watch from a man and !
"â old it for 2 cents to net food.
"I'got here aoout a month ago, and tried
to. get work. I -ot something to do occa- j
â¢sionally at the Oakland racetrack. Five 'â 
days'ago I got on a train to go to San !
Jose, but was thrown off at San Leaudro.
â¢ There I met a man Â«bout 39 years of age.
He was short and stout and had a sandy
mustache, and toid me to call him Jim.
. "He wanted me 10 go wiih him and
eteal, but I refused, i tried to fret away
.from him, but lie always found me out.
c He wq,uld be away at nisbts, and I slept
in a farmer's barn, but In tne mornings, j
â when I tried to leave 6an Leandro, he al- |
. ways turned up. He showed me things j
that he said he had stolen.
"Sunday he made me come to the City I
with him, and he pointed out tbe fruit- I
store to me. He told me to rob the till,
and he would meet me at the ferry at 7 |
o-'clock and get the money from me. 1
didn't want to steal, but I was afraid of
him. After I stole the money I saw him
''.going down tbe street, so I turned back
-n.i gave it to the fruit man.
"{ hope they won't send me to the re- i
form school. I would like to eet work
here, but if they want to send me back I
hope they will send me to my married
lister, who has a ranch in Garden City,
Kans.- 1 would not live with my step
father again."
Ttie following regarding the lad ap
peared in last night's Oakland Inquirer:
Curtis Cox. the young boy who declared
that he was going to tramp to bis home in
Colorado, but who was picked up by ttie police
at Seventh and Broadway tome days after
. ward, was befriended by a Mrs. Smith, re
. s idiuÂ« in tae vicinity of East -ixuteuth and
. Tenth avenue, but the lady nas now reported
- ttiat the boy has run away. A Contra Costa
farmer by the name of Rutherford called at
tne police station to-day and also offered to
lake the boy and give him a home and educa
tion.. The youngster, however, evidently likes
a roaming Hie better than a comfortable
'home. He has probably left the city this
time.
- Captain Robinson will to-day communi
cate Â«^nih Superintendent Carman of the
Newsboys' Home on Taylor street so that
he can have a talk with him and probably
take charge of him.
Waltz Admitted to Bail.
William Waltz, one of the striking lathers I
accused of causing the death of a non-union I
workman, ana who was sentenced to San J
Quentin for one year, ha* been admitted to
btii! by Judge Wallace, the bond being fixed at
Â¥_000. The companions of Waltz in the al
iened crime wfH apply to be also admitted to
bail.
A SOCIETY TRAGEDY.
Fashionable "Functions" Proved Dis
astrous to the Natural Jce
Skatiug Rink.
When the Natural Ice Skating Company
opened its entertainment at the Mechan
ics' Pavilion two years ago there was ,a
great rush of people who wished to enjoy
the pleasure of gliding over the glassy
surface. Natives of northern climes
wished to renew the joys ot their child
hood, and as a consequence of their per
sistent enthusiasm the venture gave
promise of yielding satisfactory dividends
for the stockholders.
That this desirable condition did not
long prevail is shown by a suit just filed
by Crane & Co. against the Natural Ice
Skating Company for $2324 43 balance due.
The original projector of the scheme
found that it cost a great deal to start the
enterprise and was surprised to see the
affair nipped by a killing frosl, more
frigid than the pond over which his
patrons were invited to "skim like swal
lows o'er the smooth lake's brim." His
explanation for the failure is unique and
is an illustration ot one of the idiosyncra
sies of Pacific Coast civilization.
Failure of the novel entertainment,
which at first promised so much and which
flattened oat so quickly, is attributed to a
blunder of the manager of the affair, who
was described as a ''society duck" by the
leading capitalist who staked and lost his
money. Just as the boom of prosperity
appeared to be so high that nothing could
stay its progress, the manager conceived
the idea of making the skating rink a
fashionable lad. He had secured the
patronage oi the common people, and he
CURTIS COX.
1 was ambitions to number the members of
I the local 400 among his clientele. With
| that object in view he proclaimed that the
rink should be the scene of a â¢'society
function" each Tuesday and Thursday
afternoon, on which occasion admission
should be by invitation only, and that
only the Nob Hill element would be
deemed eligible for participation in those
revels of the gilded youth and fashion of
the City. .â¢; . t \
For two weeks those "functions" were
. very successful, but society soon tires of
I anything, and so thÂ« attendance from the
I Western Addition fell out of sight.
In the meantime some of the folks who
j felt slighted took to discussing the sub
j ject. . , "â - . .... .-.'.-â,-,,
"We won't do a thins; to that ice-skat
| ing joint but just let it alone," said a
young man at a Bouth-of-Market social
reunion one evening.
And so it turned out. The rink was de
serted by all except a few old gentlemen
who tried to ima. ine themselves as spry
as they were in their youth, and the
; omnipresent small boy of the newspaper
selling guild. Therefore, the doors were
quickly closed and a balance of $2324 43 is
still due to the machinists who did the
work. ;7, '}â ;â â :--

DIPHTHERIA GAINING.
Six More Cases Importedâ X Special
Meeting of the Board of Health
to Be Held To- Day.
Diphtheria has made another bound for
ward in its devastating progress, and
should the present bad weather prevail
the Board of Health is anticipating a still
further increase in the number of cases.
Six cases were reported at tbe Health
Office during the forty-eight hours ending
at 5 o'clock last evening, making eight
since the first of the month. They were
located as follows: 1875 Fifteenth street,
10 Beaver street, 4214 Nineteenth street,
215 Eureka street, _2 San Carlos avenue
and 1519 Buchanan street.
There is some doubt about the latter
case being one of genuine diphtheria, but
the doctor iv attendance reported it as
suÂ»*h.
The Beaver-street case is the tecond that
has occurred in the same house.
The board will discuss the closing of the
schools that were investigated on Satur
day last in bpecial session to-day, and
there is every likelihood that two or more
of them will be closed.

Little Mamie Kelly, who lives some
where out in tbe Mission, has narrowly
eÂ«cape<i being a bride at the tender age of
16 years. Tbe girl is bardiy out of short
dress s, but she foil violently iv love with
Dillon Lefe'ovre. The possible groom is
only a boy, barely 19 years old. He deter
in i ned to marry the giri and act about it
systematically. The girl's mother vio
lently opposed the proposed match. The
girl's father was in Los Angeles. Le
febvre having been repulsed by the
mother, appealed to the father, who tele
graphed as follows:
Dillon Lefebvre, 978 Howard street: Telegraph
$15 to-day. Got j >b in O&kland. What you
a.-._ed me for Is O. K.
About this time Frank J. Kane became
interested in the case, which was brought
to his notice by the girl's motner. He
succeeded in getting the dispatch which
the father had sent from Los Angeles from
LÂ»febvre, and it appeared to him that the
$15 mentioned was a consideration. Le
leovre said that he was working, but Mr.
Kane found out that this was not true.
Then there was a scene, in which the boy

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1896.
POLICE RAIDING
THE POOLROOMS
Three of the Police Judges
Are Not Backing
Them Up.
Cases Are Always Dismissed
as Soon as Brought
Into Court.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare Raises a
Nsw Point Which Judge Joachim
sen Will Decide To-Day.
The poolroom ordinance formed the
subject of able arguments 'in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday afternoon
and cansed a sharp interchange of words
between the Judge and Prosecuting At
torney Dare.
There are a number of cases on the
calendar in this court against the pro
prietors of poolrooms for violating the
ordinance, and yesterday afternoon was
set for the trial of the first on the list
The police have been raiding the pool
rooms since they opened concurrent with
the opening of the racetrack last month,
but every case that has been taken before
Judges Low, Campbell or Conlan has
been dismissed on the ground that the
poolroom proprietors were simply acting
'as commission-men by sending the money
to the track, in accordance with the re
cent decision of Judge Wallace. Still the
police kept arresting them, to be followed
by another dismissal.
Tbe case that came before Judge
Joachimsen yesterday afternoon was that
of George F. Tuttle, 20 Leidesdorff street.
Policeman Francis, who made the arrest,
testified in effect that on October 28 he
purchased a pool ticket for 25 cents from
Tuttle, playing Caliente for a piare. No
mention was made of any commission.
The pool ticket was submitted, and there
the case rested.
The defense was represented by Attor
neys Joseph J. Dunne and S. H. Begens
bureer. Attorney Dunne moved for a
dismissal of tbe case on the ground that
the defendant, by sending the money to
the track to be wagered, was simply act
ing as a common carrier, for which he
could not bo punished under the ordi
nance.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare, in a long
and able argument, contended that the
ordinance covered the case in point. It
had been prepared by a learned ex-Judge
and revised by some of the leading law
yers in the City, and its preamble showed
how essential it was for the protection of
boys and young men. He contended that
they had proved their case, inasmuch as
subdivision 2 of section 1 say s :
No person upon any trial or contest of skill,
â peed or power of endurance between Dorses,
except within tbe inclosure of a racetrack
where (>uch trial or contest ia to take place,
shatlsell, issue or dispose of any ticket, certifi
cate or other evidence of payment on which
shall be inscribed, written or priuted any
number, name, word or mark or anything to
designate the choice selected, received or ac
cepted by anyother person to entitle or enable
the said person holding the said ticket, certifi
cate or other evidence of payment to gain or
lose on any contingent issue.
He contended that it did not matter
whether or not the poolseller sent tbe
money to tbe racetrack or what became of
it. They had the evidence of the pool
ticket and that was sufficient.
The Jud_e said that the other three
Judges had dismissed similar cases and
they would not have done so unless on
good grounds.
"Simply because the other Judges have
done a certain thing is no reason why you
should follow their example without tak
ing into consideration the law and the
evidence," said Prosecuting Attorney
Dare.
The Judge, with some asperity, retorted
that he did not require to be instructed as
to his duty. He said he would render his
decision on the motion .or dismissal on
Saturday.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare objected
strongly to such a long delay. The police
would continue to arrest people and the
calendar was already clojrged. He saw no
reason why an earlier decision should not
be given.
The Judge insisted upon Saturday and
asked Attorney Dunne if lie had any evi
dence to offer.
"None," replied the attorney.
'â¢In that case," said tbe Judge, *'I will
give my decision in two minutes."
Attorney Kegensburger said he would
have some evidence to offer, which angered
Attorney Dunne, and he said Jie would
have nothing further to do with the case.
Finally the Judge advised Kegensburger
and Dunne to settle their differences De
fore this morning, when he would give his
decision. The other cases were continued
till Saturday.
DIVES AND SOCIAL EVILS.
Police Commissioner!) and Chief of Po
lice to Be Heard by tbe Grand Jury.
The Grand Jury will hold a special
meeting to-morrow to consider some im
portant business touching the unrestrained
and open methods employed by the keep
ers of dives in this City. The committee
on dives and social evils is composed of
E. U. Cutter, M. Spiro and Harry Dur
brow. The committee on gambling, opium
dens ana lotteries consists ol C. C. Burr,
Harry W. Goodall and A. E. Drucker.
These committees have presented their
views to the Grand Jury, and it has been
decided to invite the Police Commission
ers and tha Chief of Police to meet the
jury.
The Grand Jnry to-morrow may take up
the question ol the purchase of land ior
the High School at tne Mission. On this
point some expert testimony as to the
actual value of the lot may be heard.
The committee on Fire Department.
Fir* Alarm and Fire Marshal, consisting
of B. P. Farnswortb, W. L. Ashe and D.
B. Faktor, recently made inquiry regard
ing the inadequate equipment of the fire
boats. Statements made to members
of the Grand Jury are to tbe effect that
Harbor Commissioner Chad bourne fancied
that the fireboats ought not to respond
to alarms from certain boxes, and
so he marked out quite a number of boxes
on tbe list, This order led to a reduction
of the force manning the boats, as the
Chief of tbe Fire Department deemed a
full force unnecessary if the alarms were
not to be responded to.
How Nails Are Xained.
Two accounts are given of the oriirin of
the terms "sixpenny, " "eightpenny," ten
penny and so on, as applied to the vari
ous sizes of nails. According to one state
ment, when nails were made by hand, the
penny was ta_en as a standard of weight
and sit were made to equal the weight of
a copper penny.
This explanation is open to criticism on
account of the very small size of the nails
of which six were needed to balance even
tbe large-sized old-fashioned copper
penny, others are much more probable.
One explanation holds that tenpenny
nails originally sold for tenpence a hun
dred, sixpenny nails for sixpence a hun
dred and soon, the smaller nails selling
ior the lower price. Another explana
tion is that 1000 nails of the tenpenny
size used to weigh ten pounds, 1000 of the
sixpenny size six pounds and bo for other
sizes.â Louisville Star.

BEARDS OF STATESMEN.
BfcKinley aud Bryan Are Like Many
Famons Old-Tiiners.
Both Major McKinley and Mr. Bryan
are smooth shaven, like the beardless
statesmen of tne olden time. Still, the
old-timers were not all smooth of face, no
matter how smooth they may have been
in conic airections. There were some very
smooth articles of politicians among those
old fellows, as witness the little deal be
tween Hamilton and Jefferson, which re
sulted in Hamilton getting bis financial
bill through the House and Jefferson get
ting the National capital located on the
Potomac River. Washington, our first
President, was smooth oi face, but John
Adams wore short side whiskers, but no
mi; si ache.
Jefferson, Madison and Monroe were all
smooth of face as well as smooth articles
all round. John Quincy Adams wore
short side-whiskers like his distinguished
sire. Jackson, who twice contested the
Presidency with Adams, the second time
successfully, also wore short side-whis
kers, a mere tuft to the point of the ears
in his case. Clay, another with whom
Jackson twite contended for the Presi
dency, in 1824 and 1832, neither getting it
the first time, Jackson winning the sec
ond, was smooth of face. So, too, was
Frelinghuysen, Clay's running-mate in
1844.
Van Buren had bushy side whiskers,
which nelped to make him look foxy, and
to give him the reputation he long en
joyed of being the sarewdest politician of
tiis time. William Henry Harrison, who
twice contested the Presidency with Van
Buren, losing in 1836 and winning in 1840,
was smootn shaven, as was Tyler, his run
ning mate, who succeeded * him in the
White House. Colonel K. M. Johnson,
who kiiled Tecumseh and who was Van
Buren's partner on the ticket both in 1836
and 1840, was smooth of face. He is also
the only man ever elected Vice-President
by the Senate. In 1844 Polk nnd Delias,
the successful candidates, were destitute
of mustache or beard, and so were Clay
and Frelingbuysen.
James G. Birney started the Abolition
ists to running candidates for President,
who had no chance of election in 1840, and
ran again in 1844. He wore side whiskers
of the pattern called mutton chops. Gen
eral Taylor wore short side whiskers.
Fillmore, Taylor's second on the ticket
and his successor, was smoothfaced.
Lewis Caa~, who was defeated that year,
waa smoothlaced, but his running mate,
W. O. Butier, of Kentucky, wore little
snort side whiskers. This was the year
when Van Buren ran as a Free Soil candi
date and evened up with Casa. He still
wore his bushy side whiskers, but his side
partner, Charles Francis Adams, was
smoothfaced. FranKlin Pierce was smooth
of tace. General Scott, wno ran against
his subordinate of the Mexican war, wa->
just beginning to wear meager side whisk
ers. â Washington Post.
The Invention of Envelopes,
An English paper journal says that the
invention of envelopes is within the mem
ory of middle-aged cersous, and was t c
re-ult of a Brighton (England) stationer's
endeavor to make his store look attractive.
He took a fancy for ornamenting his store
windows with high piles of paper, gradu
ated from the largest to the smallest size
in use. To bring his pyramid to a point
he cut cardboard into very minute squares.
Ladies took these cards to be small-sized
note-paper, and voted it "perfectly love
ly." 80 great was the demand that the
stationer found it desirable to cut paper
tbe size so much admired. But there was
one difficulty. Tne little notes were so
small that when folded tbere wai no space
-for address, so after some thought the idea
of an envelope pierced the stationer's
brain. He had them cut by a metal elate
ana soon, so great was the demand, he
commissioned a dozen houses to manufac
ture them for him. From such small be
ginnings came this important branch of
tne stationery business. â Chicago Tribune.

A-fter an Adventurous Cruise They

" Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call,)
:. . 908 Broadway, Nov. 23. J
. o Up to a late hour to-night it was
thought that City Attorney Peirsol aud
â¢ City Engineer Wilson had gonÂ« down
with the letter's yacht in last night's gale.
Their families were in a state of great ex
citement, as tbe two Commissioners of
Â° Public Works should have returned home
fast oighu
The two officials were not missed from
â¢Â° \ tbÂ°Â«ir offices till this afternoon, at which
â¢. .j*me a special meeting of the Board of
J. irks was cal lea. Mayor Davie was the
Tody attendant, and then the fact became
â¢ A:iown that the other Commissioners were
jiot to be found. Messages were sent in
all directions, and at the Wilson and Peir
.-ol homes the statement was made that
neither of the missing men had been
home s"ince Saturday.
Telegraph and telephone were put to
vjork, but nothing was learned, and the
â  report was circulated that the two officials
had surely succumbed to the storm. En
gineer Wilson is an enthusiastic yachts
man and has won several prizes, but yes
terday was not a day to exert either en
thusiasm or rowing qualities, and there
.were many who wondered whether Mr.
"Wilson had not p.ttempted too much.
'The two men left Oakland last Saturday
afternoon and stated that they would be
back last evening. All day yesterday
their relatives were anxious on account of
the storm, and when night came and no
word was received the anxjety increased.
Ai! to-day their families were mating in
quiry, but no one had teen the yacht or
us occupants since sailing out of the
creek.
â¢To-night Mrs. Wilson received a tele
phone message from Vallejo stating that
tbe two voyagers had been at the mercy
. of wind aud tide, but had succeeded in
reaching Vallejo.
Mrs. Peirsoi also received woid that all
was well and that Mr. Peirsol will be home
to-morrow morning. It is not thought
that he will return on the yacht, but on
something that runs according to schedule.
Neither_of the Commissioners sent word
to the # Mayor, and after waiting a reason
able time he adjourned himself aud went
home.
NO MATCH WITH BUTTE
They Accepted the Terms of the

= "OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 23.â There will
beÂ° no football match between the Botte
â¢ . and Reliance football teams this season.
The letter Irom the Butte men accepting
a the terms offered by the local club was re
| ceived to-day, but too late to be acted upon.
Manager Ewing would have to leave with I
his team to-night to meet the northern
men on time, and this would not permit
of his even notifying them.
â¢ Much disappointment is expressed over
the'result, as the games last year between
the teams were the most exciting of the '
'season. At tbe beginning of this year the '
Butte captured the Reliance captain, J
G orge McMillan, and gave him a deputy
clerkship in the county offices to hold |
him. Everybody looked forward to the
â¢me,eting of t c teams, but it will not take
â  - place this year.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Nov. 23. f
Mayor Davie stated positively to-day
that he had not decided upon anything in
regard to the appointment of Police Judge
next term. He declares that he has been
considerably amused by the publicity
which has been given to his intentions.
"There surely must be great honor in
being clerk of the Police Court," said
Mayor Davie to-day, "for there is evi
dently more interest in tnat appointment
than in the Judge. Everybody is wonder
ing who will succeed Mr. Crawford, while
nobody with any authority has yet hinted
that there is to be a vacancy. Councilman
Bassett is said to be a candidate, but if so
he has not mentioned it to me. Nobody
has yet said anything about the impor
tance of the change of Judges, but I have
read a great deal of the change of clerks.
I have only this to say: That the appoint
ment of Police Judge will not be condi
tional on the appointment of any particu
lar man as clerk. Whoever I appoint will
be left at liberty to appoint his own clerk
and bailiff."
Secretary Will Powers of the Young
Men's Republican C!ub says he was mis
| represented in regard to the action taken
' at tbe meeting last Thursday at which an
election for officers was to rmve been held.
"1 desire to say," said Mr. Powers to-day,
"that the door was not locked. It may
be that the spring lock closed accidentally,
but I am positive that no one locHed the
i door intentionally. It was well under
stood that no notices were to be sent out,
aa the club was in debt and I would not
incur any more expense. Friends of both
the candidates for the presidency agreed
with President Walsh that tbe meeting
could not legally elect officers.
"The real story has not yet been made
public. The fight is realiy for the sup
port of a candidate for Mayor. If Stetson
be elected bis influence will certainly be
exerted in favor of Councilman Towle for
Mayor, while Pulsifer's success means
| strong support for W. V. Witcher for the
mayoralty. That is the real point. There
| is no doubt that Stetson has at present
more votes in the club than anybody
else."
Considerable interest is now being
shown in the chairmanship of the next
Board of Supervisors. On the first Mon
day of the New Year a majority of the
toard will go out of office. The retiring
members are Bailey, Pelouze and John
ston.
Messrs. C. Roethe, Joiin Mitchell and
Thomas Wells will take the empty seats.
Hiram Bailey is at present chairman, and,
according to precedent, his successor will
be either Talcott or Church, the old mem
bers of the board. The position is one of
much importance, as it carries with it
the appointment of several committees.
None of the new members have so far
announced their preference, bat it is
stated that an effoit will be made to elect
Thomas Wells. As Wells is the only
Democrat, while there are four Repub
licans, it in not likely that the vote on
chairman will be unanimous.
Klein Exonerated.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 23.â An inquest
was held to-day at Alvar.ido to inquire
into the death of Mathew Petersen of
San Francisco", who was killed yesterday
near the Piummer Salt Works by the acci
dental discharge of his friend's gnn.
Last Friday afterncon Petersen left
home with Harry Klein, an intimate
friend, to bunt ducks on the marshes.
They were seated side by side when a
flock of ducks arose. Mr. Petersen
called "MarK" His friend's gun was
lying across his arm, and in the excite
ment the jjun was nischarged, and Mr.
Petersen, it is thought, leaned forward at
the same moment, receiving .the charge in
his side. From the effects of the wouud
he died.
The injured man was conveyed as soon
as possible to the house of Mr. Robie the
manager of Plummer's Salt Works, and
everytning was done for his comfort pend
ing the arrival of Drs. Allen and Emer
son. An examination showed that recov
ery was impossible, the liver being torn
and shattered by trie shot.
The jury returned a verdict of accidental
death and exonerated Mr. Klein from all
responsibility for the accident.
Mathew Petersen was the son of H. M.
Petersen of 313 Montgomery street, San
Francisco, and was 25 years old, having
been born in San Francisco in 1871. He
was a member of Golden Gate Parlor,

John P. Irish will lecture to-morrow even
ing at Shattuck Hall on "Reminiscences
and Personal Experiences of the Recent
Campaign." He will dwell particularly
on his lecturing work while following up
Bryan on a special train.
The burlesque, "The Maebeths of Berkeley,"
which the Stanford students will produce at
the California Theater on Thanksgiving night,
was written by young Fields, one of the bright
est of the senior class. It is pronounced an
exceedingly clever travesty, and there are
many original hits in the play. The entire
programme ior Thursday night is an excep
tionally good one, and a large crowd is an
ansured (act to judge from the advance tale of
seats at i'aio Alto.
TENDERED A RECEPTION

Touunl t yitnrtainxd.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov. 23.â The
local section of the National Council of

REDUCING THE COMMISSIONS
The Southern Pacific Come* to an Agree
ment fTith Western Line*.
CHIGAGO, 111., Nov. 23. â Western
railways have secured from the Soutnern
Pacific an assurance that on December 1
it will join them in a reduction of com
missions on California immigrant busi-
ness to a normal basis. For months there
has been no profit in this class of trans
portation because of the excessive com
missions paid, amounting in some cases
to $16 a ticket. The Canadian lines have
also expressed their intention of doing the
same. This will mean a gain all around
of about $10 a ticket on all immigrant
traifiu to California, the normal commis
sion being $5.
A new ngreement respecting excess bag
gage carried by theatrical companies has
been made by the Western Association
lines through the efforts of Chairman
Catdweli. Special cars containing bag
cage or theatrical property will be charged
for at the rate of not less than 15 cents a
mile for any distance, with a minimum
charge of $10 a car. The lines moving are
to use their discretion in making addi
tional cnarge where the service involves
intermediate stops. For pnrties of ten or
more 150 pounds will be carried free and a
special car provided if the revenue from
the tickets is not less than $25, with an
extra car for every additional twenty-five
passengers.

NAT C. GOODWIN
IN A NEW PLAY.
A Crowded House Greets
Loie Fuller in Her
Mystic Dance.
The Alcazar Company Opens the
Week With a Well-Staged
Piece.
"Humanity" at the Co'umbia and
"Hearts of Oak" at the Grand
Opera-House.
Despite the rain and the fact that Loie
Fuller had 'drawn away a large following
to the California Theater, there was a
good-sized audience to greet Nat C.
Goodwin and Maxlne Elliott at the Bald
win Theater last night.
The play was Madeline Luce'tte Ryley's
new comedy, "An American Citizen,"
which has hitherto been heard only in Aus
tralia. The piay, Goodwin himself and Miss
Elliott were all most warmly received;
indeed at the end of the third act Goodwin
was called five times before the curtain and
finally made a speech in which a great
deal of gladness was expressed.
"Believe that nothing I can say," he re
marked, "can express the delight and
happiness I feel. It is a joy indeed to feel
ourselves once more among friends. We
had one of those 'artistic' triumphs in
Australia, but there is one thing to look
back to â that they indorsed an American
play, played by American actors, and
written by an American authoress â Mrs.
Ryley."
Mr. Goodwin went on to say that be had
other new plays with him, including one by
Mrs. Ryley, and that he hoped to come to
San Francisco every year and play some
of them. He concluded by invoking a
Lie-sing on the audience, and was fran
tically applauded.
"An American Citizen" is a decided im
provement on "Christopher Jr." It is
well constructed. Unlike most light
plays, it keeps up the interest to the last.
That last was rather late, for the audience
did not leave the theater till 11:30, which
shows that "An American .Citizen" needs
some cutting. This is a fault that can be
easily remedied, however. There is real
wit in the play, and some of the repartee
is most original. The plot resembles
"Christopher Jr.," in that it tells the
story of two people who are married sud
denly by force of circuiiistances, and who
afterward fall in love with one another,
and who go through a good many triais
and tribulations before they arrive at the
condition of living happily ever after
ward.
The development of the plot bears no
relation to "Christopher Jr.," however,
and the trials and tribulations in "An
American Citizen" are most comically
pathetic.
Mat C. Goodwin had a thoroughly con
genial role in the part of Beresford Cruger,
the American who married his cousin on
first sight and became a Britisher in order
to prevent his uncle's money from going
to found a museum of antiquities. The
semi-pathetic, semi-comical love troubles
which afterward befell him were thor
oughly in keeping with his line of work.
As the English cousin Maxine Elliott
looked handsome and acted with a good
deal of impressiveness, though her ren
dering of the role lacked tuose subiie
touches of which it would have been capa
ble in hands like those of Maud Auairs,
for instance.
The rest of the cast showed that the
company has improved somewhat since
Goodwin was here last. Neil O'Brien was
excellent as Simms, the English valet,
and the other men did their parts satis
factorily, though Frazer Coulter's elderly
make-up as Brown was abÃurd under the
circurcsances and his acting wasno more
satisfactory than his make-up.
Miss Estelie Mortimer was excellent as
the elderly coquette, and the girls' parts
were well acted by Gertrude Elliott, Ethel
Browning and Isabel Haskins.
California Theater.
Standing room was at a premium to see Loie
Fuller's dances at the California Theater last
night. The star had been put late on the pro
gramme and people were getting a little im
patient, when about 9:45 o'clock the house
was plunged into Egyptian darkness and ail
eyes were turned toward the stage for the first
sign of La Loie's appearing.
She did not gladden the audience by an im
mediate apparition, however, and a few en
terprising spectators began to strike matches
and were applauded by their neighbors. At
last, however, Miss Fuller was seen dimly
outlined against a dark background, and im
mediately after a flood of electric light re
vealed her in all the glory of endless yards of
blnck draperies, stud. ted with glittering stars,
to represent Night.
The dances were five in number and no en
cores were given, nor indeed exiiected, for the
programme must have been fatiguing enough
as it was. Ot course ail the dances had the
tame general features. Miss Fuller kept yards
and yards of draperies in constant and grace
ful motion, while her electrians threw com
plicated and beautiful combinations of light
upon them. With every dance the draperies
seemed to grow longer and more voluminous
and the combination of color more gorgeous.
In the White Dance Miss Fuller received a
good deal of colorless light from her elec
tricians, but she had rainbow tints also. The
Firmament showed a number of tender colors,
as well as vivid tints. In Fire white draperies
wert> dettly manipulated under the glare of
brilliant reds, and in the Nile Lily a mam
moth lily was formed from draperies of great
length.
The art of the dances, of course, consisted in
the management of draperies and the ex
quisite arrangement of colors in ths lights,
which came irom below through glass let Into
the stage, as well as from above.
Miss Fuller is a graceful, winsome-looking
young woman, who trips prettily about the
stage and bends with ease and grace. Her
skill in manipulating the filmy fabrics she
wore was remarkable, but of dancing, in the
ordinary acceptation of the word, she did little
or none. Her exhibition was an artistic treat
of color and graceful motion, however, and,
though there was not very much to distinguish
it from the dancing previously given here by
Mrs. Herrmann and I'apinta, Miss Fuller fully
deserved the recognition she received last
night, for it was her brain that originated
the exhibition that has found so many imi
tators.
A great deal of applause and a few cries of
"braval" were given the dancer. In the dark
ness people in the front rows and the boxes
must have hurled bouquets on the -stage, for
when the lights were turned on it was seen to
be incumbered with flowers, which must have
interfered a good deal with La Loie's gyra
tions.
The programme which preceded the dancer's
appearance consisted of local talent. Bern
hard Mollenhuuer, who played a violin solo, a
grand fantasia by Vieuxtemps, was well re
ceived, and so was the Treble Clef QiÂ»*jtet.
Professor Charles F. Graeber's tan jo, mando
lin and guitar club played. F. K. Tobin and
Mrs. Lotta Navarro Tobin gave a trombone
duo.
The programme will be repeated to-night
and to-morrow.

and party; box B â General and Mrs. War

At the Alcazar.
Those general favorites of the Alcazar Stocfc
Company opened their thirteenth week at
the pretty O'Farrell-street theater last night
to a good house, notwithstanding the rain.
The play was "The End of the Century," for
the first time produced on this coast. It is
Russian, with the glory of imperial St. Peters
burg in the foreground and cheerless Siberia
in the distance. The staging of the piece and the
costumes of the players were ricn and appro
priate, especially the court robes of Miss Lieb,
the Princess Kostoi of the story. John T. Sul
livan is confined to his room with a wound in
his left arm, received in the stage duel last
week, and Francis Powers memorized the
sixty paces <>f his part in twelve hours and
played the difficult role without a rehearsal.
May Buc'.dey, the star ingenue of the first
plays, had a more serious par*, as Fanny Lar
key, which wÂ»s not the sprightly little lady's
natural role. The other characters were satis
factorily acted, and a number of curtain cal>s
were accorded the players. The piece will be
played all the week, with Saturday and Sun
day matinees.
Bush-Street Theater.
Kennedy and his hard-working set of come
dians manage to attract good audiences at the
Bush-street Theater. The mesmerist varied
his programme last night to the extent of hyp
notizing a lew women, who quite coyly were
induced to accept seats on the stage.
Kennedy was somewhat at a disadvantage
in handling the ladies. The laugh-making
rough-and-tumble of the men had to make
way to plain mesmerism when the females
were in evidence, and the fun was tame.
A few ludicrous situations, such as love
making and frenzied waltzing by those under
hypnotic influence, helped to while away a
couple of tedious hours. The redeeming feature
was when an apparently consumptive woman,
weighing hardly 100 pounds, was made to
show the strength ot an ordinary man. She
was in a state oi catalepsy and performed the
bridge act, with her feel on one chair and her
head on another, as cleverly as the robust hire
ling who preceded her.
At the Orpheum.
Quite a hit was made at the Orpheum last
night by the new Orpheum polkn, which
was cleverly played by the cornetists, A. H.
Knoll and Marie McNeil.
Eriward Heffernan, a new-comer, gave some
amusing Irish songs and monologue work,
and George Thatcher and Ed Marble, two
other additions to the bill, did some excellent
minstrel work, which won several encores.
The Hengler sisters hare returned for one
week only.and Lewis and Elliott have arranged
a new and amusing act, in order to add to the
attractiveness of Thanksgiving week.
The rest of the bill cousists of Lavater'sdog
orchestra, Howard and Bland, Burt Shepherd,
the twentieth century comedian, and the
Quaker City quariet.
"Hearts of Oak."
The Grand Opera-house began the week last
eveniug with James A. Herne's old successful
play, "Hearts of Oak." The piece hag always
been a iavorite here, with its vivid shipwreck,
its homelike country-house kitchen, and Crys
tal and the real baby. Howard Kyle was
Terry Dennison, the sailor, who comes back
Enoch Arden-like to contemplate his wife as
belonging to another, and his own tombstone
â a dismal welcome truly for the dying wan
derer. Victory Bateman played her role of
sweetheart and wife quite feelingly. "Hearts
of Oak" will be given all the week.
At the Chutes.
The wet weather only temporarily casts a
damper on the Chutes, and the roller-skating
rink is iv operation rain or shine. This week
will be a gala one, as every schoolchild has
been presented with a ticket good for Thurs
day. Friday or Saturday afternoon. Thanks
giviux day Emil Markeberg wi.l make one of
his wonderful balloon ascensions and iv the
evening there will be an elaborate display of
fireworks. "Arion" still rides his bicycle on
the high electrical wire, and Pirri coasts down
the chutes on his wheel every night.
Tivoli Opera- HÂ«.uÂ«e.
The pretty performance of i: Donna Juanlta,"
which began its second week at the Tivoii last
night, suffered, as did several other attrac
tions, from the rain, and the new bllis which
were being exploited elsewhere. The house,
although small, was liberal with its applause,
however.
Columbia Theater.
The second week of "Humanity" opened at
the Columbia last night to an audience which
no doubt owed its meager proportions to the
rain and the counter attractions elsewhere.
The play will run for the rest of the week.
The popular Zeisler orchestral concert takes
place next Sunday evening at tne Baldwin
Theater.

SIMILAR TO ACTUAL WARFARE.
General Ruger Has a Plan for Extending
the Scope of the Field Practice
of the Army.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 23.-A Herald
Washington special says: General Ruger
has suggested plans for the extension of
field practice of the three arms of the mil
itary service. He advocates the acquiring
of suitable ground of small value for agri
culture or other use convenient to the sta
tions of military companies in the Depart
ment of ihe West and throughout the
country where target practice may be had,
the land being of such variety of surface
as to admit of free movements and tiring
without concern as to limit, to simulate
ligat artillery action in battle.
The ground might also t>e used for a
large garrison, to which several regiments
of infantry, one of cavalry and light bat
teries might be sent in turn one or two
years, to constitute practically a training
school for young officers for duties of com
mand. In a comparatively short time
there will be no officers on the active list
of the army who have bad opportunity
for command or of observation of military
exercises of considerable bodies of troops.
Appropriations will be asked for tbe pur
pose of this proposition and tor massing
bodies of iroops for exercises similar to
actual warfare. These assemblages are to
take place frequently, and it is intended to
join with them the organized forces of
the different States ior instructions. The
proper arming and drilling of militia is
one of the cardinal components of the
plans proposed for the extension of the
military strength of the country.
The passage of the pending bill for the
increase of the military force of the regu
lar army is to be strongly urged by the
Secretary of War in his forthcoming an
nual report, and it will be strenuously
urged in the next Congress along with
other pending legislation "tor the increase
of the army in efficiency.
The army is unquestionably in a better
condition in every respect than ever be
j fore in its history. The officers are better
equipped for their duties, both theoret
ically and practically, and the men are of
a better class morally and physically and
are better housed, armed, instructed and
drilled.
It is unlikely that the United States will
establish a military post iv Alaska for the
present. General Â£. S. Oti?, commanding
the Department of the Columbia, in his
annual report to the general commanding
the army, says that under tne existing
conditions no benelicial results could be
expected from the services of the troops in
the Territory, and as the civil officars do
not need their aid in the southern and
more populous sections, their presence in
the Territory is not required.
Clears up a Myiteriou* Theft.
KEWANEE, 111,, Nov. 23.â The con
fession of Charles B. Bull to the robbery
of $4800 from his employers, Otto and
Henry Rastede, clears up a mystery
which has puzzled the Sheriff of this
county and his deputies for three weeks.
Bull's employers kept their valuable pa
pers and money in a tin box whicti was
b'-iricd under the front porch because
Henry Rastede's wife objected to so much
money being fcept in the house. Bull saw
him come from under the porch, stole the
treasure when his employers were absent
and buried the treasure in a corn field.

GRANNAN HAD HIS
"DOPE" WITH HIM
The Plunger Took Nearly
$10,000 Out of the
Ring.
Had His Coin on Every Winner
With the Exception of Shield
Bearer.
Palm?rston Scored the First Time
Outâ The'ma Beat Kamsin in a
Hard Drive.
When Riley Grannan, the plunger, arose
from his couch yesterday morning he
must have taken down from his shelf of
turf "dope" books one labeled "Mud,"
for the slim young man from Kentucky
was in high-class form. He began the
day by backing Palmerston, who captured
tLe opening race, and followed it up by
playing the succeeding three winners. He
went astray on Shield Bearer, who finished
third in the final race on the card, but is
accredited with removing to his inside
pocket between $8000 and $10,000 of the
ring's surplus cash.
The track was in a fearfully slushy con
dition from the continuous downpour of
rain, and of course the mudlarks were in
demand. The crowd was quite successful
in picking them, as three well-backed
favorites splashed in ahead of their fields.
W T itn one exception the finishes were
close, being won in hard drives.
Palmerston, an Eastern horse running
in the colors of L. H. Kline, took the first
race of the day, backed down from 6 to 5
to 9to 10. Passing Jack Atkins and Nic
Nac opposite the paddock he beat the
first-named gelding out a neck in 1:05.
Kanisin, the homely son of Blazes, came
very, very close to landing the purse in
the event following, over seven and a half
furlongs. Backed from 7 to sto 13 to 10
he had the 11 to 10 choice, Red Glen, in
difficulties at the head of the stretch, and
soon assumed the lead. The last furlong
young DenniÂ«on on T' elma got a great
move on, and catching Kamsin at the pad
dock the pair indulged in a hard drive,
which resulted in the brown mare getting
the verdict by a short head. The winner
was as eood as 8 to 1 in the betting.
The Iml* midget jockey, Johnny Woods,
rode the Bto 5 favorite Ricardo in the
next raceâ :i five and a half furlong dash,
decided under selling conditions â with the
skill of a veteran. Getting the geldinjr
away from the post second, he fell back to
lifth position and then making his run
through the stretch reached the stand two
lengths before Petrarch, which horse came
last at the end. Hueneme finished in the
show.
Although an unknown quantity in the
mud, Osric II was made a 3 to 5 favorite
for the six furlong selling sprint for two
year-olds. Principe had taken the lead
from Lady Looran by the time the bend
for home was reached, and in a furious
drive with the first choice the last six
teenth beat him out a half length. Lady
Looran was a good third.
Eight fast sprinters went to the post in
the final five and a half furlong spin.
Both Babe Murphy and Shield Bearer
were backed down from threes, the former
closing a slight favorite at 2to L Sport
McAllister and Banjo were aiso accorded
considerable support. As usual, the
speedy Quicksilver showed the way to the
stretch, where he blew up. Shield Bearer
later took up the running, but was passed
by both Babe Murphy and Sport McAliia
ter, the former winning in a fierce drive by
a scant head.
Notes.
The programme for the first week's rac
ing of the next Ingleside meeting was
issued yesterday. A most commendable
feature of the programme is the fact that
two events at a mile or over will be de
cided each day, for one of which a $500
purse is hung up.
Charley Thorpe, who will ride for Burns
& Waterhouse, arrived from the East yes
terday.
Pat Dunne disposed of Petrarch for $300
to Eugene Leigh prior to his race yester
day.

RODE ON A BUCK'S BACK.
An Adirondack Hunter Meetg With a
Thrilling Adventure.
Jerry Thompson is an excellent trapper
and a man of great fearlessness, but he
doesn't particularly care to repeat the
adventure that recently befell him. When
a man plunges through a wild and rugeed
region on the back of an infuriated deer,
he is having an experience which falls to
the lot of few, if any, men, and which
they, it may be safely assumed, little care
to have happen them, says the Philadel
phia Times.
That was Jerry's experience recently.
The fact that he was not killed by the
deer was due to his quick wit and extreme
agility. Jerry was wandering about the
Adirondacks in search of game, when he
suddenly encountered a big buck. Tne
meeting was so unexpected that both man
and animal were for the moment too sur
prised to act. Quick as was Jerry the
buck was quicker and before the luckless
hunter fully realized his position he was
rolling over and over on the ground with
the raging animal stamping furiously at
him.
Jerry struggled to his feet, but before he
had regained an upright position the buck
came at him with lowered head. It tossed
its huge antlers wildly about, and had it
not been for a sudden resolve that flashed
across his mind Jerry would have been
impaled upon the sharp prongs. When
the buck was just about to spear him
Jerry clutched the animal's antlers, and
in another moment he was astride the
much-surprised buck's back. Then came
a series of snortings, buckings and kick
ings which discounted the antics of any
bucking bronco that Jerry says he has ever
seen.
Half a mile was traversed before any
thing like a low tree came in the direction
of the buck's mad chase. Jerry braced
himself; he felt sure that if he were struck
by the lower limbs of the tree nothing
short of a miracle would save him. The
tree, happily, was not a young one, but
one that was stunted, and had poss.bly for
many years withstood the furious blasts
of wind tnat had howled through that
wild and desolate region. Its limbs were
stout.
On flew the deer. Nearer and nearer
came the tree. Jerry in his furious race
imagined that it was racing toward him,
eager to lay him low at the buck's feet.
When almost directly under the limb
which projected across the deer's pathway
Jerry by a powerful effort raised himseif
up and with a clutch of steel grasped the
friendly limb of the tree and swung him
self clear of the buck's back. In another
moment he had drawn himself up into the
tree. With an angry snort the buck
turned and charged at the tree. Stout as
was the tree, Jerry felt the impact dis
tinctly when the maddened head of the
deer struck.
BICYCLIST AND THE SNAKE
A Story Full of Details That Could Be
Scarcely Called Corroborative.
When a story about a snake is told it is
always taken with a grain of salt, but thÂ»
following is told by a man whose veracity
I has never been questioned, and that every
word is absolutely true there is no doubt.
A half dozen wheelmen were sitting in
the shade of a tree on the Mendham pike,
between Mendnam and Morrisiown, N. J.,
wnen a man was seen approaching, push
ing a part of his wneel in front of him
and carrying the handle bars across his
shoulders. The wheel and rider both
looked dilapidated.
"You seem to have had an accident,"
said one of the party, addressing the man.
"An accident!" returned the stranger;
"I should think I have!" and he dropped
the broten wheel and staggered over
toward the shade. He was paie, and there
! was a haunted look about his face that
i made the other men think that he had
suffered some bodily injury in the acci
dent.
"I hope you have not hurt yourself,"
said the first speaker.
"No," answered thÂ« man, "I am not
hurt physically, but if you fellows could
I have seen what 1 saw a mile back you
wouldn't feel quite chipper, either."
"What was it?" asKed one of the men.
"Tell ns about it."
"It was awful," said the man, and he
looked as though he were about to faint.
I "It was a snake â a great, big, poisonous
reptile. I saw him on the road and
thought I would run over him for fun.
When my wheel touched him he raised
his head and ran his fangs into the tire.
The tire exploded like the sound of a gun,
and, would you believe it, it blew that
snake's head clear off his body. I had a
puncture, but punctures are common with
wheelmen, and I was preparing to mend
it when 1 saw the links on the chain
break one by one and fail to the pround.
Then my handle bars began to change
color arid turned jet black. "I couldn't im
agine what it was for a time, but when I
saw the rest of the wheel begin to turn
black and shrivel up I realized that the
snake s poison had gone all through the
wheel."â New York Evening Sun.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1896.
REV. R. V. BOWEN, the New Pastor of the New Jerusalem
(Swedenborgxan) Church.
WILLIAMS MUST
MAKE A DEFENSE
Judge Daingerfield Refused
to Instruct the Jury
to Acquit.
Witnesses Tell of the Circular
That Criticized Judge
Hebbard.
Mysterious Order for Printing Thou
sands of the Document â Array
of Legal Talent.
Lawyers, witnesses, jurors and inter
ested spectators thronged Judge Dainger
field's courtroom yesterday to participate
in the opening of the trial of Thomas S.
Williams Jr., who was indicted by the
Grand Jury on a charge of libeling Judge
Hebbard during the recent political cam
paign.
Judge Hebbard was a candidate for re
election and Williams was one of his most
active opponents. In company with
Beveral others, all depositors in the ue
funct Home Savings Bank, he issued a
circular charging Judge Hebbard with
being an unfair man in handling the
affairs of the bank, alleging that he un
justly dealt with the depositors, that he
allowed excessive compensation to John
F. Sheelian as receiver and manager of
the depleted institution, and that he per
mitted Attorney James Aiva Watt to
draw exorbitant fees for legal services.
When court opened Judge Hebbard was
seated with District Attorney Barnes, and
while the selection of the jury was going
on he displayed much, activity in
scrutinizing the names drawn from the
box and in suggesting questions durimr
tne examination of the talesmen. W. W.
Foote and Julius Kahn are associated
with the prosecution, while the defense is
represented by Henley & Costello, George
W. Baker, Crittenden Thornton and
Charles B. Darwin.
District Attorney Barnes, when inquir
ing into |the qualifications of proposed
jurors, was careful to ascertain whether
any of them are acquainted or friendly
with Judge Hebbard. John F. Sheehan
Alvinza Hayward, Rolla V. Watt, Jaraes
Cross, James Aiva Watt, George Stone,
Henry Eickhoff, Jeremiah Lynch or W.
T. Baggett, it being understood that the
acts of those gentlemen in connection
with the wrecked bank will be closely scru
tinized during the trial.
Following are the names of the jurors
impaneled to try the case: John D. Rob
ertson, John Riordan, T. R. Horton, John
M. Donlon, Adolph Tacksher, Orri'n Bai
ley, Meyer Cahen, Alfred Eis-len, Charles
M. Christopher. M. H. Gaffney, John
Percy, John M. Mehrtens.
Thomas Curtin, a detective, testified
that he has known Williams for sixteen
years. He met Williams in his tailor
store a few days before the last election.
He went into the store to have a suit of
clothes fitted. While he was putting on
a coat Williams handed him a copy of the
circular on which foe charge oi'libel is
based. The witness did not see any other
copies of the circular. At this point a
copy of the circular was introduced in ev
idence and identified by the witness.
Mr. Curtin said that when he first went
into Mr. Williams' store they began to
talk about the clothes, and soon after he
handed the circular to the witness, who
said he read it and remarked that it was
pretty hot stuff. To this McCarthy replied
that tnere was something more coming
that more circulars were being printed.
Mr. Curtin admitted that he was subse
quently employed to do some service in
the case. He was employed by Henry
Eickhoff, and some of his (Curlin's) em
ployes shadowed Williams alter the print
ing of the circular.
On cross-examination Attorney Barclay
Henley secured an admission by Mr. Cur
tin that he was not sure that the circular
introduced in evidence was the same as
the one shown him by Mr. Williams. He
had not read over the paper just sub
mitted to him, but from what examina
tion he had made he thought the two
documents were identcial. He would not
undertake to repeat the substance of the
charge against Judge Hebbard, beyond
the fact that it said the Judge had ap
pointed John F. Sheehan receiver of tne
bank, for which the latter had drawn
down $500 a month. He explained that
Mr. Williams refused to let him lake the
circular, saying that it was the only copy
he had.
Frank Cowles, a tailor, testified that
Williams handed him four copies of the
circular on October 27, telling him to dis
tribute them among his friends.
Attorney Henley objected on the
ground that this related to the 27th of
October, whereas the indictment was
found on October 24. This objection was
overruled.
"Did Mr. Williams tell you anything
about the printing of the circular?" asked
,Mr. Foote.
The witness answered: "Williams told
me that he had a few of tne circulars
printed and that somebody else got in and
got a lot more printed, something like
70,000 or 75,000, he didn't know exactly
which."
This was regarded as important by the
friends of Judge Hebbard as it is intended
to make a further inquiry as to the iden
tity of the persons who manifested such
unusual interest in the defeat of Judge
Hebbard.
At the conclusion of Mr. Cowles' testi
mony the prosecution rested its case,
whereupon Attorney Henley moved that
the court instruct the jury to bring in a
verdict of acquittal.
In support of his motion Mr. Henley
contended that the publication of the circu
lar, even if proved, was a privileged com
munication because it was addressed to
voters touching a person who at that time
was asking for the suffrages of the electors
of this City and County. Malice, he said,
could not be presumed, and aa the exis
tence of malice had not been proved
ainrmatively the j lry oui:ht to acquit.
Attorney Foote replied that the bare
circumstances showed malice; t!>at it was
established by testimony that VN illiams
distributed the circulars after his atten
tion had been called to the matter by an
indictment; thatt he circular bore intrinsic
proof of malice on its face, because it was
apparent on the reading that the words
were clearly outside of legitimate criti
cism even of a candidate for public office.
Judge Daingerfield took Mr. Foote's
view of the case and refused to instruct
the jury to acquit, and the taking of tes
timony for the defense will begin at 10
o'clock this morning.
JOKE ON JAY COULD.
Hia Wicked Partner, Jim Flak, Checked
Out Mi- Bank Account.
Fisk liked a joke on bis partner better
than anything else in the world. Gould
kept a balance of some $30,000 in the
Tenth National Bank for his personal ac
count, household expenses, etc. Being
called West on a mission that lasted sev
eral weeks, he left his checkbook locked in
the safe drawer, to which Fisk i.ad a key.
In the office was a clever young clerk
whom Fisk had causht in the act of imi
tating his and Gould's signatures, the
imitation of Gould's being a facsimile.
Within an hour after cne Wizard's de
parture checkbook and clerk were to
gether under Fisk's supervision, and at
nis instigation more than a dozen blank
checks were signed with the name of Jay-
Gould, and in the course of a month the
$30,000 ha<i disappeared, Fisk being att'iat
time in the clutches of Josie Mansfield.
On the very day of Gould's return the
bank sent a notice of overdraft. The little
man nearly fainted. He had several fits.
His excitement was intense. He declared
that there was a conspiracy to ruin him.
He hastened to the bank and they
showed him the checks, signed by himself
tliey did not doubt, and he raved and tore
his hair. Nor could he doubt the signa
ture. It was genuine, even in his own
eyes. A rigid investigation was started,
which Fisk put an end to Dy informing
Gould, with many a poke in the ribs, that
he had drawn and used the money.
"Did Fisk make it good?" an innocent
asked when the story was told.
"Return the $30,000?" was the reply.
"If Fisk had returned it Wall street would
have cried."â New York Press.

SOME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
IN JAMES G. FAIR'S LIFE
His Likes and Dislikes, Cunning, Caution and Love
of Small Talk Shown in His
Letters.
A Queer Custom of Signing All
Kinds of Odd Names Save
His Own.
CONTEST FOR THE LETTERS.
Revelations Mad; Public in a Suit by
Jerome Caidwell Against
Charles L. Fair.
A suit filed by Delmas & Shortridge yes
terday in a case where Denson &De Haven
are of counsel throws more sidelights on
the character of ttie late James G. Fair
than anything that has ever yet been
printed. The case is that of Jerome
Caldwell vs. Charles L. Fair to compel
the delivery of many of the late Senator
Fair's letters.
The lights and shadows in the public
and private life of the Senator, his man
ner of corresponding and his methods of
judging men and things appear quite
fully in ninety-four letters, which are the
subjects of the sait.
The letters were written to Jerome Cald
â well, Senator Fair's trusted aerent and per
sonal friend, during the period from No
vember, 1858, to Junf, 18JM.
The suit is by Jerome Caldwell, now of
Los Angeles, against Charles .L. Fair. The
petition alleges that the i lain tiff is the
owner cf the letters in question, copies of
which are set forth in a schedule attac ied
to the complaint; that between Janu
ary 10 and July 1. 1595, tne plain
tiff, at the reque.-t of Charles
L. Fair, intrusted the latter with
the care and custody of the letters, un
der defendant's promise that he would
return the same on request. The object
of the loan was to make a comparative
Btudy of "the pencil will," and it was after
an examination of these letters that the
authenticity of the pencil will was ad
mitted.
On the 23a of November, so the allega
tions run, the plaintiff demanded of de
fendant that he return the letters, bat he
refused to do so, "and in violation of his
promise retains* possession of them." It
is further alleged that the ietiers are of a
private character, for which reason it is
hard to ascertain their pecuniary value.
The complaint, therefore, prays that spe
cific delivery of the letters oe compelled.
Many of the late Senator's epistles treat
of matters not discussed in polite society,
the language being coarse and often posi
tively vulgar. In moments of autrer, or
when discussing persons whom he did not
like, the millionaire Senator [at none go
unwhipped of what he considered justice,
though it was often a rude justice he ad
ministered.
The writer loved small gossip, and
listened to scandals with an eager and a
hungry ear â if they affected people he
knew. He often discussed family matters;
often inquired for small gossip of people's
doings and sayings, and was conning
about divulging facts about his own move
ments and intentions.
Of punctuation and capitalization the
stern millionaire knew nothine, though his
spelling was usually correct. A peculiarity
was the absence of almost every punctua
tion mark except the dash, but he used
that in few instances, his sentences run
ning along for great lengths without the
ign of a stop for breath, or a fall of the
Voice.
Another peculiarity is seen in his use of
strange nicknames or nons de plume for
himself, many of the epistles being signed
"Shaw's Flat," or "Whimtown," and one
or two "Fawning. 1 ' The name "Whim
town" was one ol his favorites, as was
"Shaw's Fiat."
It is hardly probable that the writer be
lievea such signatures would hide his
identity, but he took a strange delight in
designating himself in this odd way.
Taken as a whole the letters show a
stern current of common sense, but a
marvelous littleness in many thine;*, or a
love of studying small things. Even in
matters political he inquired lor trie opin
ion of "old Smith, the blacksmith," or of
some equally unimportant political fac
tor, and often asked his correspondent to
kÂ«ep him informed about small t ings.
Thi Call presents a number of the let
ters complete, and the reader may learn
from them many peculiarities of the man
ofvast resources and many millions.
The following letters, partially corrected
and punctuated sufficiently to make them
plain, a tning Fair did not think
worthy of attention, show some of
the late Senator's characteristics in treat
ing of matters affecting his political inter
ests. They show a minute study of small
local situations, a great desire" lo know
tne attitude of men of small influence in
politics, and a memory for wrongs. Tnese
two are typical of many and are sub
mitted as fair samples of a correspondence
that extends over many years :
Palace Hotel, )
San Francisco, Oct. 10, 188O.J
Jerome Caldwell Esq.: I received your Letter
but It diU not contain the information de
sired. I am aware smith is not a Democrat
but desire to know it he was friendly outride
of politics you should have wrote more

what did he say? Spend a few moments in
â¢writing. I have spent many hours in your In
terest when hard pressed for time. Yours in
haste, J. G. Faie.
7 Nevada block, San Francisco.
Pan Francisco, October 6, 1880.
Jerome Caldwell: I wish you would make a
friendly call on Joseph Smith, the biacksmith
near the Ophir, and see if he is friendly to me
in the coming election, then drop me a line to
No. 6 Nevada block, San Francisco, when I
return, then call and see me. Yours.
J. G. Fair.

way of referring to some conduct of his
correspondent that pleased him:
Angeles, Nov, 25, 1858.
My Dear Friend: I want to write, but I
scarce know what to say by way of condolence
for your bad lucic, and doubly so from drag
ging my debts along with you in these hard
times, but if years of attention will earn
enough to repny you you will find I "ill act
the part of a man with you for your noble con
duct with me. I saw Hunter here on yester
day, he soid us without a doubt, his own
story would convict him. â¢ â¢ â¢ J. G. F.
Next in the exhibits comes a quaint ref
erence to matters known only to the cor
respondents. There is a strange reference
to "b:ood drying up" and a reference to
the safety of letters put in the United
States mails. This letter shows in a strik
ing way how the man's caution and sus
picion blended in his transactions. He
often signed himself "Whimtown."
Christmas Day, 1884.
Dear Whimtownâ Monogue may be the manâ
of course, such a thing must exist in super
stition only. The Idea of blood drying up.
Then as to H., I am unable to guess who it
mny be.
There is no risk in the mails. Letters
dropped in the cars on leaving never go
through postofiices, and are not handled.
Men never undertake to open sealed letters
without wax. The latter the best.
I said i.oihiHfc to Lyman, but he is honorable
and trueâ any lilnt you give him that I was
always kind to you. Father and your mother
in need would place you right. Stone is my
lawyer and anything you learn about Dick
Deys' sayings and doings he would be glad to
know. â¢ â¢ â¢ I hear Fanny will marry soon.
Whimtown.
I hear old Joe Smith, the wagon-maker and
blacksmith was a great enemy of mine. Is it
so? Also that he was in DickDeys 1 employ.
The man of many millions, the king of
large estates, had little use for men who
talk too much. The following throw
light on this phase of his character:
February 1, 1884.
I have yours ol the 21st. I intended to tell
you to send me back my letter after you had
jotted down certain things in it. Such things
might fall into the hands of someone who
talks. You must work slowly and with great
care. It will turn up to you quite easy after
you get a start. I know La b knows all,
but you have little hope thereâ he is so
cunning. Fitzgerald and perhaps Prentice, or '
one of them, it has been told i> me, were to
do the work don't let any one mail your
letters. Do your letters couie to the Con. Va.
offices? lam gicd thai it is the impression
that I will not return to the coast.
What reason do they assign? Was it Tom
thnt your man saw below that looked so con
tented and was lining on the fat of the laud
or some one else?
I hope you are getting along smoothly. I
had a letter from your brother Charles and
am trying to get him a place. He writes a
good letter. Yours, J. G. F.
Under date of May 6 the wrfter mys
teriously hints that somebody was once
hired to kill him, discusses his wife's af
fairs and inquires for current gossip:
May 6, '84.
Dear Fay: 1 have two letters from you, he
last April 29. In the former you said that
Fannie had given Patton a hard talking to. I I
do not know who tlii-, Fannie is. but suppose I
it was the old madam. If so, what had she to
complain of. P.Â»rt of your last letter 1 cannot
guess. I was aware Rooney sent letters to his
sister through the servant girl. I have 25 of
them.
I know nothing of the Fitzgerald you speak
of. I have never given him auy coin" or caused
it to be given. I know of do papers he had or
aught about what suggested there. I always
thought Rooney hired him to kill me. I know
nothing of the great crime you refer to. I
guess that there is no one afraid io go to Vir
ginia; they will find this so when I return.
I have heard nothing of tne second boy going
to the bad. Tell me all you hear about it.
Why should Lamb hate F. so? I don't beileve
It. I wish you to report that you heard I was
going to Europe soon. Yours, in g'eat haste,
Shaws Flat.
Correspondent Caldwell is next in
structed on the methods of penmanship
that best pleased the Senator. Incident
ally he discusses many Dersonal and
minor matters:

note all saidâ l now understand who Fannie

I am glad you reported me'going to Europe.

what his wife knows about Fannie.
What has Charlie been doing? Find cut all

I wish I knew shannon's reasons for being
disappointed at my trip. It may be he is em

Try and write smaller, more fully and with

', believe Lamb is down on you. Ycurs, truly
! yours, Shaws Flat.
While in the halls of the United States
Senate the busy statesman of many mil
lions found time to write many letters,
marked by a style wholly their own.
The following abounds in expressions
which will be recognized as characteristic
of the man:
United States Senate, j
Washington, D. C. June 16, 1884.)
Dear Jail, C. (,'.: 1 hove yours of May 19th <fc
Juue 2d &. 3dâ l am in my seat and cannot
writ** much I have Deen to N "York twice
in West Va. five days or I would have
wrote you oftener â It's a shame Jim did not
kill himself with either Pistol or Poison he
and Tom are terrible fools.
The madam has gone to Madam Mackay in
Europe. Tne children came here all they
could before leaving for Paris. They had but
one friend to go to the ship with them &
that a rough one. Your statement thatShaws
Flat killed i-ome one is absurd. Jim said he
spoke very fully. If so, in God's name why
did you not say what he said?
Thomas is all wrong in his statement. She
had $7000 to come Dack with, but played this
as a trick and succeeded; even Taylor now
knows this. The report of old Shannon that
we would disincorporate the mines is all bosh.
Pat Cotter is an honest boy and tells only the
truth. He is simple-minded.
It is impossible lor me to write much. You
are very faithful and collect a great deaL In
time I may be able to assist you if things give*
out in Virginia. Keep on the run of your
brother, as I may want him before long.
Yours, Shaws Flat.
On Jun6 28. 1884, amid the noise and
bustle of legislation, the Senator found
time to discuss loafers and men wbo stand
on the street corners and watch women:
United States Senate, (
Washington, D. C, June 28, 1884. J
Dear Jerome: I nuve your kind letter of the
20th of June & note all you say â I can reply
to but little of it as I am in my seat <fe talk
& noise is loud and thickâ Things must be
thinned out very much now as all the mines
are stopped or about soâ it looks to me as
though that crowd had about got through
with Patton â Lyman is a good & faithful
man and will probably get Xiis place. If the
madam should Dfe angry witn any one It
Should be Taylor Curly Bill and Patton but
there Is still Enough that she never suspected.
When you see au^ht in the papers about me
cut it out, with the date of the paper, and in
close it. The article referred to I will hunt
for. as I take the Chronicle.
Jimmy will be here to-morrow. Poor boy
he is drinking some; I may be able to control

TIE COOS STOLE
THE CHICKENS
Exciting Experience of Po
liceman J. J. Crowley in
the Mission.
ent to Arrest a Thief Who
Was Locked Up in a Hen
house.
Toe Thief Prov d to Bs a Coon, Which
Was Killed With an Ax Wielded
by the Owner.
Policeman J. J. Crowley has had an ad
venture that has nearly turned his hair
Cray.
About 9. o'clock Sunday night George
Terrill, 3627 Seventeenth street, sent a
message to the Seventeenth-street police
station that a thief was locked up in his
Henhouse, and to send an officer at once to
arrest him.
Crowley, who is a recent addition to the
force, was on station duty, and Lieutenant
Burke instructed him to go with the
patrol >vagon and bring the chicken-thief
to the station.
"You will have to be careful," said the
lieutenant, "and keep your head cool, as
the thief may be armed and offer resist
anc."
Crowley smiled grimly, and after care
fully examining his revolver took his seat
in the wagon and in a few minutes reached
Terrill's house. Terrill told him that for
weeks past valuable fowls had been stolen
from the henhouse, but the strange thing
about it was that only one was taken at a
time. A lew minutes before he sent tlie
message to the station he heard a commo
tion among the fowls, and knew that the
thief was there again, so he quietly
slipped up to the henhouse and locked the
door.
Crowley and Terrill held a consultation
of war and decided upon a plan ot opera
tion. Terrill armed himself with an ax
and Crowley pulled out his revolver and
lighted a stub of a candie he had in his
pocket.
Terrill held the ax in his right hand and
inserted the key in the lock with hiÂ«i left
band. Just as he threw open the door
Crowley was to level the revolver at the
thief and order him to throw up his
hands.
When all was in readiness Terrill un
locked and threw open the door aud
jumped aside with ax uplifted, while
Crowley leveled his revolver and had just
got the words "Throw up out of his
mouth when something dashed out of the
henhouse and rushed between Crowley's
le^s, tripping him up ana throwing him
on his back.
"What is it?" yelled CrowJey.
"It's a coon," yelled Terrill, who aimed
a blow at it with the ax and split its head
open. It had a hen in its mouth. The
coon had been the thief, but how it si
ways managed to get into the henhouse
as it was always locked at night, is a mys
tery. J
Crowley had to return to the station
without a prisoner, but it will be a long
time before he recovers from the scare the
coon gave him.

BRIGHT LIGHTS WILL SHINE
ON SIXTH STREET'S PAVEMENTS
A Progressive Movement Inaugurated by the Mer
chants of the Northern End of
That Thoroughfare.
A Demand for the Withdrawal
of Bobtail Cars Will Soon
Be Made.
AN ELECTRIC LINE WANTED
The Street May Be I laminated Next
Saturdayâ Preparations for a
Grand Celebration.
"We are going to whoop up Sixth
street." That waa the announcement
made last night by one of the prominent
merchants doing business on that thor
oughfare.
The storekeepers on Sixth street, follow
ing the example of those on Polk street,
have decided to erect electric lights on
Sixth street, from Market to Folsom.
Joseph L. Jacobs, and L. G. Jacobs, his
brother, a clerk with Mrs. Harriett Jacobs
of 26 and 28 Sixth street, went on Poik
street a few nifhts since, and, noticing
the improved condition of that thorough
fare, wondered why Sixth street could
not be made attractive. They consulted
with L. V. Merle, B. B. Duncan and
George B. Starr, wno are interested in the
first block south ol Market street; with
H. Elibach, who does busintss in the next
block south, and H. Woiff, who is in busi
ness on the block between Howard and
Folsom, and the result of the consultation
was a determination to interview the
electric lignt company and obtain rates.
These were rixed at $6 50 for six months
for each storekeeper in advance, six li?nts
to a block, providing a stated number of
individuals in each block would pay that
amount. Then followed a canvass of the
people, Starr, Merle, Duncan and L. N.
Jac"bi doing the work in the first block;
H. Elsbacli, H. H. Plant, John Moore and
8. liosenthal in the second block, aud
Herman Wolff in the third block.
Each committee met with a great deal
of success, and by 6 o'clock last night had
received sufficient signatures to warrant
the ordering of the lights placed in posi
tion. In the first block thirty-ight signa
tures were obtained, in the second block
forty-five and in the third thirty-seven.
The number necessary to make up the
requisite number will be obtained to-day
or to-morrow, as the property -owners will
be called upon to <-onirit>nte.
"Not on y do we want more light," said
J. L. Jacobs, "but we propose to organize
a permanent improvement club and de
man-i that the three blocks be bitumen
izeu, and that a better car service be put
on. We shall ask the railroad company to
withdraw the bobtail rattletrai s a:id sub
stitute an electric line to connect with the
San Jose depot. In this we will enlist the
property owners and storekeepers south of
Folsom street.

"OF A CRIMINAL CHARACTER."
Peculiar Arguments Made by Attorneys in
tfte Santa Fe Receivership
Case.
TOPEKA. Kans., Nov. 23â In the
United Slates court here this morning tho
deposition of A. W. Oliver, Ira Welch, W.
A. Thomas and Frances Q. Flannagan of
St. Louis were filed by the Santa Fe rail
road attorneys to substantiate their charge
that the recent receivership was brought
about for stock-jobbing purposes. The
story alleged in these depositions is to the
effect that A. E. Pinkney of Kansas City
knew when, where and how the receiver
for the road was to be appointed, and he
so informed the parties. When the case
was called this morning a postponment
was asked until 2 o'clock and was granted.
When the case was called at 2 o'clock
Judge Foster decided to hear first the
motion to remand the case to the District
Court of Jefferson County. Judge Henry
Keeler opened with a statement of the
j points involved. The non-federal ctiarac
er of the suit was presented as an argu
ment for its beins remanded to the Dis
trict Court. He sustained aia claim with
rather exhaustive references.
Civil cases alone, he maintained, could
be removed, and this case was of a crimi
nal character. The suit was brought, he
asÂ«ert d, by authority of the State and
under a statute which imposed a penalty
in the name of the State.
Judge Horton opened his arguments for
the Santa Fe, but he had only spoken a
few minutes when adjournment was taken
until to-morrow morning.
DEPEW'S PATRIOTIC TALK.
Interesting Anniversary Exercises of the
Vermont Society, Sons of the Rev
olution.
MONTPELIER, Vt, Nov. 23.-The an
niversary exercises of the Vermont So
ciety, Sons of the Revolution, were held
in Armory Hall this afternoon, the chief
feature being an oration by Chauncey M.
Depew. At the armory fully 3000 people
assembled, including delegations from
Bu Hngton, Rutland, St. Albans and other
places.
The hall was divided into sections and
the guests were seated by a detail of
twenty-four members ol the Vermont Na
tional Guard acting as ushers. The exer
cises opened with prryer. Ex-Governor
Dillingham then, after a felicitious ad
dress, introduced Mr. Depew. Mr. Depew
devoted the major portion of his remarks
to a sketch of colonial history of the
Green Mountain State, its part in the rev
olutionary war with the glorious incidents
like Bennington, Ticonderoga and Crown
Point until in 1791, when Vermont added
another star to the flag of the Union.
Then after an eloquent extolement of the
principles of our Government and the
duties of patriotic societies to educate the
people, he said:
"The shifting standard of value is not
American. A paternal government is not
American. Any effort to array the people
into classes, when employers and em
ployes are constantly changing places, is
not American. An assault upon ths im
portance of the judiciary is not American.
American liberty is the liberty of law and
order."
He concluded:
"Gentlemen, let us learn and teach the
principles upon which our Government
has grown to its great and beneficial prD
portions; let us enforce the lesson that
American liberty is the. preservation of
American opportunity for a man to rise
above the condition in which he was
born, and win honors from his fellowmen
and protection from his country, the re
sults which have come to him by his tal
ents, his industry, his wisdom, his pru
dence, his thrift and his good citizenship."
A reception was given Mr. Depew after
the exercises.

Under Official Surveillance.
LEBANON, Pa, Nov. 23. â John H.
Hoffer, cashier of the First National Bank
of Lebanon, is under official surveillance.

counts over $100,000. The shortage was

ered a period of six years.
