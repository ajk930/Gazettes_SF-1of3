; - Chicago, July 2. )
A silver ground-swell is bearing down
on Chicago. It threatens to submerge the
Democratic party and leave intact only
that portion of it that stands for the white
metal. The gold men are fighting harder
than ever, and when the reserve force from
New York reaches here by special train to
morrow afternoon this bitter factional
war will be fought to a finish on the lines
already mapped out, even if, in the lan
guage of the silent general, it takes all
summer.
There are only four days intervening be
fore the date on which the Democratic
braves of the country will gather in Na
tional conclave at the Coliseum. Up to
two weeks ago the great issue was the
platform, and the gravest point the char
acter of the currency plank. All other
questions were overshadowed. Candi
dates were not considered, the more com
plex problem being whether the conven
tion would declare for sold alone as a
monetary standard or whether it would
speak out boldly for the free coinage of
both gold and silver at the ratio of 16 to L
The developments of last week have set
tled the question. The platform of the
Democratic convention is already written.
It will declare for the free and unlimited
use of silver as money. There will be no
compromise. The silver men are masters
of the situation. They will run things
next week to suit themselves, even if the
party should forever split on the rock of i
financial discord.
The plan of certain silverites is to hold a
big caucus on Monday next. This move
ment originated with the Bland mana
gers. They believe that their candidate
would stand a better show before such a
gathering than he would in a convention
where a two-third rule governs. Governor
Stone of Missouri is pushing this proposi
tion and has the support of Governor Alt
geld and the Illinois delegation, but the ,
Wharton Barker, a Noted Philadelphia Banker and Editor of the "American,"
Who Is a Silver Candidate for the Democratic 1 residential Nomination.
Boies contingent does not take kindly to
it, and there are others who think it
would be better to have the convention as
a whole 3elect a candidate. Th*y hold
that in this way they will be able to
soothe the ruffled temperament of the
sold men, who would otherwise sulk in
the harness and probably openly rebel
against the dictation of the solid South
and West. The disposition of the Boies
people to go before the convention is
probably encouraged to some extent by
the belief that they will draw considerable
force from the Eastern States. In fact the
rumor was in circulation about the head
quarters of the different candidates to-day
that New York would in the event of not
being able to secure a gold man at the
head of the ticket throw its 72 votes for
Boies. The Bland men were very much
alarmed over this rumor and consequently
are working with renewed energy to have
the caucus plan carried into effect. It is
doubtful if the other candidates apart
from Bland would agree to such a bargain,
as they realize that their chances would
be very much better before the general
gathering.
J. W. Farras, who is the original Bland
boon>er, and also the personal representa
tive of the Missouri farmer, and who first
nominated Biand for Congress in 1872,
told me that be did not thinic the New
The San Francisco Call
York; delegation would accept Boies as
tbeir candidate any quicker than they
would Bland.
"It should be a matte? of indifference to
New York who the convention will select
as its candidate," says Mr. Farras, "since
he will stand upon a silver platform, while
the Empire State is solid for gold. Of
course, if New York has decided to throw
its seventy-two Totes for Boies, it would
give him about 140 votes on the first ballot,
and eventually he might get the nomina
tion. But I am not prepared to say that
the story is true. It came to us from an
unsolicited quarter. Anyway, we are not
worrying very much about our candidate.
He is leading in the race now, and we are
hopeful of nominating him."
It is generally believed that Altgeld has
thrown the influence of Illinois to Bland.
His many secret conferences with Gov
ernor Stone would lead the onlooker to
such a conclusion, since the former has all
along held aloof from the managers of any
particular candidate. Chairman Furgeson
of New Mexico called at the Bland head
quarters to-day and said that his delega
tion vras for the Missoarian. Alabama
was also counted to the credit of "Silver
Dick" by the young man who makes up the
returns at the headquarters. Judge W. H.
Barnes and Wiiey Â£. Jones, delegates
from Arizona, who had just arrived in the
city, say that the delegatiou leans toward
Bland, but any candidate will be accept
able as long as the platform declares for
silver. Judge Barnes is an old-time resi
dent of Illinois. He was appointed to the
jndgeship in Arizona under the first
Cleveland administration, and has sine*
been a resident of that Territory. Judge
Barnes is after the scalp of William C.
Whitney of New York.
"I just want to meet that fellow Whit
ney," said Judne Barnes. "I just war.t to
meet that fellow," said the Arizona Judge,
as he quaffed a few paragraphs of red
liquor in the cafe of the Auditorium
annex to-night, "and I wili make him

South and the West combining to repudi
ate the National debt. I want to tell him
to his teeth that the people of tl-.e South

8T. PAUU Minw,, Jnly 2.â The most
sensational manifesto in Minnesota's his
tory was that issued this afternoon by the
silver Republicans, who refuse to support
McKinley for President, dough for Gov
ernor or any of the Republican candidates
for Congress. The prominence of the men
signing it attracts widespread attention.
Among them are Lieutenant -Governor
Frank Q. Day, Congressman Charles A.
Towne, ex-Coagressman John Lind, State
Senators Morgan, San born, Howard and
Smith. The address is issued to the Re
publicans of Minnesota and says:
The greatest Issue which has arisen In this
country since the abolition of slavery now con
fronts the American people. The common poo-
Senator leorgc Giabam Vest of Mi- souri, Who Will Labor for Silver in the
Councils of liis Party at Chicago.
pie have viewed with increasing alarm the
effort of a foreign money aristocracy to fasten
upon this Nation the single gold standard of
value. In the past they turned with the in
spiration of faith to the Republican party for
protection against that power which seeks to
strike down one-half the redemption money
of the world that the other half may purchase
double the amount of products of toil.
They had' a rich t to expect such protection.
From. the day: of the â  party's ivlrth until the
present time no article of KftpuiJiican - faith
has been more pronounced tnnn the belief In
bimetallism. , It has been written in its plat
forms and taught by all Its great leaders.,. In
the National Convention in 1868 it con
demned "the policy of the Democratic admin
istration in its efforts to demonetize silver." ' â 
In 1892, in its platform adopted at Minne
apolis, it declared in favor of icolci and silver
as standard money. In 1894 the Republican
party of Minnesota reaffirmed Its belief in
bimetallism.
The action of the National Republican Con
vention at St. Lonis has repudiated a funda
mental doctrine oi our party, t'ne single gold
standard has been indorsed. The Republican
party no longer stands for both <?old andsUver
as primary money, but for sold only. We can
not accept the new faith and vro will hold
steadfastly to the old. The policy of gold
monometallism means prolonged and intensi
fied depression ; an endless and hopeless era of
falling prices for our farmers and other pro
ducers; continued uncertainty of employ
ment lor our womingmen, with lessening
wages following the fall in prices of the prod
ucts of labor; discouragement of all enter
pri-vs and in tne end universal bankruptcy
and gravitation of all money into the hands
of money brokers.
Everyfman who places country above party
and whose sympathies are with the producers
as aj-ainst the money brokers and bondholders
oÂ»ves a duty to his conscience aad to his coun
try which can only be discharged by putting
forth every effort in his power that the slight
of the single gold standard may not be fast
ened upon this people.

WELLS. Nev., July 2.â This has been a
quiet day with the delegation. The dis
cussion of platform and candidates was
postponed by common consent until to
morrow. The chairmanship of the dele
gation, National Committeemen and com
mittee assignments will not be considered
until we reach Chicago. Tarpey and Dwyer
are most talked of for member of the Na
tional Committee.
Harry Wise is trying hard to convince
us that a tariff on raw wool should be
made a part of the Democratic platform,
but we persist in loosing at the question
from the standpoint of the people who
wear woolen goods. He is not discouraged,
however, and will present the matter to
the committee on platform.

BEATRICE, Nkbb., July 2.â The Blue
River, as a result ot the heavy rainfall of
yesterday morning, has reached the dan
ger stage, and is within a foot of the high
water mark of 1892. Residents of the west
side were obliged to vacate their homes,
and during the night men in boats were at
work rescuing those who could not get
away. Dana Slee.th was drowned. This is
the only fatality so far as known.
At Wymore twenty-five families are
homeless, water surrounding their houses,
which are flooded. The water is thought
to be receding, and train service to the
north, which was abandoned last night,
will be soon resumed. In the farming
districts crops are submerged and some
livestock drowned.

The Illinois Governor and Dictator of the
Solid Silver Element Induced to Curb
His Ambitions Because of a
Rabid Record.
No new or startling developments have been noted up to midnight in the
political situation. Boss Altgeld has given ordera that the work of the conven
tion shall be rushed through in one day if possible. He fears that delay may give
the enemy time to muddle the financial issue, and aa this is a silver convention,
with no Democratic principles to be reaffirmed or pointed to with pride, the job
might as well be done with one sweep of the knife.
In view of the scandal which might be caused by the selection of Altgeld v
chairman of the convention, the Governor of Illinois has accedVd to the request of
the Governor of Missouri and has withdrawn. He will content himself on the
floor of the convention in directing the plans laid by him and hi* friends.
The gold men are to be assisted by Federal officials from Washington, and If
they cannot succeed in nominating a inure conservative man than Blnnd they will
vote for the Republican candidate. JOHN PAUL COSGRAVK.
"Thb Caix's" Heatjqpabtebs, )
The Auditorium, >
Chicago, July 2.)
The Democratic party is like the hero in a
political opera bouff c. The old Greek adage,
"Whom the gods wish to destroy they first
make mad," needs an addition in their
case of the word ludicrous. The Democ
racy is not only mad, but even funny. In
the desperate straits to which it has been
driven it has cut loose from its old-time
moorings and is drifting on the silver seas
toward breakers in the misty unknown.
Democratic principles have vanished from
discussion. They appear neither on the
stage nor behind the scenes.
In fact, it has ceased to be a Democratic
convention. It is a convention of siiver
ites pure and simple. An old-time Demo
crat surveyed the crowd in the Palmer
House to-day, listened to the extempo
raneous debates, looked up and down and
around the room as though he had missed
something, and, turning to a bystander,
inquired with a bewildered air: "Where
is the Democratic party? I don't see any
body here but silver men and Populists
and cranks. I thought tie silver men and
Populists were going to meet in St. Louis
on July 22." Then the old man, shaking
his bead and squirting some tobacco juice
on the boot of a gentleman trotn North
Carolina, walked out of the hotel. No
wonder that the old man felt lost in that
crowd.
While the vase has been shattered, the
scent of Democracy does not hang around
it still by any means. It is apparent now,
and it is not contradicted, that the silver
men have captured the National Demo
cratic organization, and that they propose
to conduct it in their own interests with
out reference to those principles which
made the Democracy one of the stable
parties of this great Nation.
Anarchist Altgeld raised the black flag
with the death-head and croas-bones this
morning in Springfield, to which place he
had gone after having laid the mines and
set the electric wires with Governor Stone
of Missouri for the destruction of the
Democratic party and the resurrection
from its ashes of a silver phenix. The
Governor said that the silver men wanted
a one-day convention, and that he was of
the opinion that a one-day convention
would be all that would be required to ex
plode the mine. He and his friends did
not wish to take the risk of a delay, ad
vantage of which might be taken by the
gold men to muddle the platform and to
hamper trie adoption of an out-and-out 16
to 1 free-coinage plank.
This is a sufficient intimation to all par
ties concerned that the silver programme
has been completed, and that the work of
the convention will be rushed through in
one or two days at most. There was only
one erasure on the slate as originally pre
pared by Altgeld and Stone, and that was
the wiping out of Aitgeld's name as chair
man of the convention. It was found that
Aitgeld's record was so loud that the De
mocracy or the new party to which it has
given birth would not be able to run a
good race with Altgeld astride of its neck.
The leading Democrats, many of whom
were personal Iriends of the Governor of
Illinois, called upon him and succeeded in
persuading him to relinquish the honor?
of the chairmanship. This was a very
difficult task, and the gentlemen who
accomplished the feat are being warmly
complimented upon their success, for it is
easier to pet to heaven than to persuade
Altgeld to change his mind or to be politi
cally decent. The saying is abroad that if
Governor Altgeld saw anything to dis
please him in the appearance of Peter he
would hurl defiance into the teeth of the
venerable doorkeeper and would go around
the back way and climb over the wall.
The men who are in the minority â
those who are opposed to the free coinage
of silverâ have given up all hope and are

now sharpening their knives upon the
grindstone of revenge. They declare sub
rosa that if they cannot win the fight they
will do everything possible to prevent the
silver cause from triumphing next No
vember. It is understood that they would
be favorable to the nomination of Vice-
President Stevenson for the Presidency
because it is said that his veto could be re
lied upon to stand between the gold men
and their enemies. In the contingency
that they should not be able to procure
the nomination of Mr. Stevenson or some
other candidate equally acceptable to
them they will do all in their power to
prevent any re-enforcements from joining
the Democratic party, and with this end
in view their agents have been already at
work among the Populists for the purpose
of preventing any fusion between the two
parties.
Teller of Colorado would be acceptable
to the Populists because he would not be
in the camp of either of the two great
parties. But the gold men have taken
pains to insure the defeat of Teller before
this convention, and this was not a hard
matter to accomplish, because the argu
ment "to the Democrats belong the spoils"
has apnealed irresistibly to the great bulk
of delegates out of a political job.
A straight Democrat will be nominated,
and there is every indication to believe
that one will be silver Dick Bland of Mis
souri. In that event the Populists will
put up Teller of Colorado, and in this
they will be assisted by the gold men, or
they will nominate some well-known Pop
ulist. The gold men prefer that Teller
should be the nominee, because he would
be able more successfully to divide the
silver vote than any other man now above
the political horizon. Even if a Populist
should be chosen as the standard- bearer
of the third party he wonld swing away
from the Democracy the vote of the Pop
ulists who are committed in their national
platform to bimetallism.
In either event the ranks of the silver
iti-s will be wedged in two. As the canse
now stands it is simply a matter of the
supremacy of brains and superior organi
zation. The gold men having succeeded
in dividing the enemy according to the
ancient rule of war, "divide and conquer,"
will throw their influence for McKinley
and protection and will join the conser
vative sound-money army now marching
under the banner of Republicanism to vic
tory and to the prosperity of every man,
woman and child in the Nation. Presi
dent Cleveland, the head of the Demo
cratic party next to Governor Altgeld and
the logical exponent of its so-called glor
ious principles, has not yet spoken his
mind as to the beauty of Democracy in
tnis its most trying hour since the stormy
days of 1860. He has gone into ambush
at Gray Gables and will appear upon the
scene of public life as soon as the smoke
of the convention has been blown away

He will, however, be well represented in '

Washington, some of whom are here al- J .
ready, and the remainder of whom are ex- :
pected here by Sunday. They will assist i
the cold men in whatever proÃrarnme

that the gold men, even if they do not !

will desert tbe Democracy, and will unite !
their fortunes for weal or for woe with the '
Republican party, which is marching for- '
ward in line of battle with banners proudly
waving and with a solid front.
A story has been afloat for two or three
days to the effect that Eastern men will
allow the National Committee to ttame a
conservative silver man for temporary !
chairman. There is no truth whatever in j
this report. The convention will not to!- j
erale for any of its officers from chairman
to doorkeeper any man wbo is not and |
wbo bas not been a stanch, outspoken ad- j
vocate of their cause, nor will the conven

The Inter Ocean this morning published
a very clever cartoon representing four i
tattered tramps with bedraggled roosters !
on their hats knocking at the door of the '
Coliseum for admission. The first is
labeled "Deficit" and carries in his hand
â  valise containing bonds and pawn
tickets. The second is labeled "Depres- 1
sion," and slunp by a cord over his ;
shoulder is an old oyMer-can, used as a i
growler, marked "Tariff Reform." The !
third is "Uoubt" holding by the collar a ;
tarred dog named Enterprise. The
fourth is "Disaster," carrying a bundle of
newspapers marked 'Business failures,

cents to 0 cents."' The cartoon is sub- i
headed "The Delegates at Large. Per

I met Jerry Driscoll here this morning,
Jerry who used to be Chris Buckley's
secretary and who during the reign of i
that gentleman in San Francisco politics â¢
had a monoply of poolroom and other
gambling privileges. Jerry was looking j
very well and would serve for a fire alarm
la a country town should his costume be
flaunted In the public street. Business j
did not go well with him after Mr. Buck- !
ley retired to his Livermore vineyard and |
betook himceif to the manufacture of ;
wine. So Jerry took up his residence in !
Chicago and has now the monopoly of the :
bookmaking privileges at tbe racetrack .
here, besides half a dozen poolrooms in â 
different parts of the city. Jerry told me i
that Cnicago is getting a little bit too !
slow for his ambition, and that if he could j
make the riffle he would go to New York
and capture the rscetrscks there.
Some curiosity is msnifested as to the J
manner in which the California delega- j
tion wiil receive Governor Altgeld's orders |
when they arrive bere next Sunday â that 'â 
is, when the delegates arrive, tbe orders 'â 
being already here. It is not believed by
those who know the men that United
States Senator Stephen M. Wi.iteand Con
gressman Maguire will bend the knee or
dolt tbe cap to Altgeld, and there may be
other delegations of tbe same kind, but it
is feared tbat the wires have been too well â 
set to be broken through very easily, if '
at all.
The thing which is the most solid up to '
date is the Bland boom. That is thriving. :

Dr. D. A. Sabiakin-Ross of Yankton, j

chairman of a contesting delegation of :
eight silver men. he alleges that the ;
regular delegation of eight goid men "sent

at 10 o'clock next Monday morning, shall

CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
But the Cold Men Do Not Propose
to Surrender to Silverites
Without a Struggle.
CHICAGO, 111., July 2.â The proverbial
calm before tbe storm prevailed to-day.
Having accomplished everything possible
in advance of the arriving of a respectable
number of silver delegates on the ground,
the Democratic Bimetallic National Com
mittee and inose co-operating with it took
â¢ rest from their labors so far as meetings
or conferences are concerned until to
morrow evening, when another round-up
of all the white metal supporters then in
Chicago will be in order.
The ranks of tue 16 to 1 advocates were
re-enforced to-day by the arrival of Dr. J.
J. Mott of Nortn Carolina and who is
chairman of the executive commitiee of
the Independent or new silver party,
formed in Washington a year ago. For
reasons which he deemed sufficient and
which he lias not explained the head of
the silverites did not take up his abode at
the Sherman Honse, wherÂ« the silver head
quarters have been established, but in
stead chose a hotel on the same street
but a couple of blocks away. %
From here, and without consultation
with any of the silver people that pre
ceded him, he sent out an invitation ior a
conference on Saturday night of represen
tives of every party and faction favorable
to silver, including Populists, silver Demo
crats and silver Republicans. As to what
it was intended to accomplish by this con
ference Dr. Mott was reticent, but the ex
pression of sentiment among those that
flocked to his quarters during the day in
dicated a decided preference for the nomi
nation next week of such a candidate as
could be indorsed by the Silver and Popu
list conventions at St. Louis three weeks
hence upon a platform dealing with no
other issue than that of the free and un
limited coinage of silver. The executive
committee of the Independent Silver party
meets here on Saturday, and at to-morrow
night's meeting or conference of tbe Dem
ocratic Bimetallic Committee and the sil
ver delegates a committee will be ap
pointed to meet the independents with a
view toward united action.
Sentiment aniODg the silver men crys-1
tallized to-day in favor of the selection ofl
either Governor Stone of Missouri or \V.I
J. Bryan cf Nebraska as temporary chair-l
man of the convention, with Senator!
Isham Harris and Major Tovrles, secre
tary of the bimetallic committee, as per- |
maneat chairman and secretary respec
tively. The Â«tory was published this
afternoon that Senator Harris had been
definitely chosen as permanent chairman,
but at the headquarters in the Sherman
House the fact that no meeting had been
held to-day was cited as proof that this
was purely guesswork. Through Senator
Jones the silver men went on record to
day as opposed to the suggestion made by
members of the National Democratic Com- I
mittee that Senator David 13. Hill might â 
prove acceptable to both factions as tern- !
porary chairman. Senator Jones insisted,
that, wbile personally he bad the highest !
regard for his New York associate in thÂ«Â»
Senate chamber, he couid not countenance
the idea of a supporter of the gold stand
ard presiding, even if for a short while
only, over a convention that was opposed
to his views three to one. Senator Hill,
he said, would not be acceptable to the
silver people, and consequently there was
nothing to be gained by a fuiher consider
ation of his alleged availability.
In the absence of materialâ in the Â«hape
of delegates witn votesâ for the making of
deals or the winning of converts the
boomers expended their ammunition to
day on the motley crowds that invariably
invade tbe hotels on the eve of a National
Convention. Much after the fashion of toe
sideshow men at tbe circus, they took pos
session of the rotundas of the hotels and
held forth to those inclined to listen con
cerning the merits of their respective can
didates.
At one time this afternoon four distinct
booms were in process of advocacy on the
ground floor of the Palmer House, and
the cheers and yells and shouts and
ironical ejaculations of the listeners com
bined to create a din that can be as well
imagined as described. The friends of
Mr. Bland were perhaps the most active.
In addition to their headquarters at the
Palmar and tbe Auditorium annex they
opened up rooms to-day in the entresol
of tbe Sherman House, where a commit
tee lay in wait to corral such ot tbe arriv
ing delegates as might first of all seek out
the quarter* of the Democratic silver com
mittee.
Mr. Bland's friends were in high feather
to-day, and, while unable oa account of
me paucity of delegates already in sigtu
to give out any dehnite figures, insisted
that tbe prevailing sentiment in the city
and the advices w..ich they were receiving
from the octside warranted them in taking
tneir stand mat it was Bland against the
field ana with the field already giving
evidence of beiiig on tbe run. The friends
of ex-Governor Boies, however, were by no
means disheartened by the claims of the
Biand men and feil back on the argument
that it was votes rather that shouting that
made nominees.
Delegate Bre water of Creston. one of the
chiefs in the Boies bureau, and who had a
talk with Governor Aitceld just before the
latter left for Springfield last night, quoted
him as declaring tuat he had cot spoken a
word on the subject of Presidential possi
bilities; that he was no more friendly to
Biand than to Boies, and that the time
had not yet arrived when tbe Illinois dele
gation could fasten itself to any one can
didate. Out of this tbe adherenta of the
lowa man managed to extract considera
ble comfort. There was more or less talk
about tte hotels to-day concerning the
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 3, 1896.
iioket made up of tbe two B's, Bland and
Boies; but tbe lowa people frown down
any suggestion that their candidate would
accept second place.
Vice-President Stevenson and Governor
Matthews of Indiana were also talked of
considerably for the second piece on the
ticket in tbe event of the nomination for
tbe Presidency going for Mr. Bland, and
late in the day ex-Governor Campbell of
Ohio was talked of in the same connec
tion. Not a single name of any person
hailing east of the Alloghanies was
broached, however, and as one of the sil
ver people put it, the general opinion
seemed to be that if there was an Eastern
man of National reputation who is favor
able to silver be must have taken to the,
woods before allowing his convictions to
go on record.
The friends of Governor Matthews of
Indiana and his aspirations were re
enforced to-day by the arrival of Will
English, son of the late Hon. \V. H. Eng
lish, who was a candidate for Vice-Presi
dent on the Hancock ticket of 1880. Al
though not a free silverite, Mr. English is
a warm friend of the Indiana executive
and was elected delegate at the latter's re
quest. His wealth and influence, it is
said, will be freely used id GoTernor Mat
thews' behalf.
The local sound-money Democrats be
gan to bestir themselves to-day and ar
rangements were made for a conference of
all the gold-standard delegates that may
be on the ground to-morrow night. It
will be held at the Auditorium Hotel. So
far the silver people have htld the right of
way and there has been considerable criti
cism over the failure of the Illinois sound
money committee to do anything toward
counteracting the efforts of the opposition.
For Saturday nielit there has been ar
ranged a mass-meeting in the Auditorium
propÂ«r and at which Senators Hill, Gray
of Delaware, Vilas of "Wisconsin, Palmer
of Illinois, ex-Secretary Whitney, ex-Gov
ernors Russell of Massachusetts and Wal
ter of Connecticut, Peck of Wisconsin,
Flower of New York, Francis of Missouri,
Hon. Robert E. Wright of Pennsylvania,
Allen McDermott of New Jersey, W. D.
Bynuru of Indiana and William S. Shee
han of New York are expected to make
short &ound-money addresses.
WILL FIGHT ALTGELD.
The New York Delegates Expect to
Take Down the Governor a
Peg or Two.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 2.â The ad
vance guard of the New York Democratic
delegates started from the Grand Central
depot at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon. They
went accompanying Mr. Whitney, and
will show the Chicago silverites the sort of
men wbo, representing New York, will
make the tight for cold at the National
Convention. Mr. Whitney's party in
cluded Senator George Gray of Delaware,
Senator J. S. Smith of New Jersey, ex-
Mayor Grant. ex-Police Commissioner J.
J. Martin. Thomas Ryan, Colonel G. B. M.
Harvey. C. C. Baldwin, Smith 11. Weed,
Walter Stanton, J. McDonald, F. H.
Dubignon, Thomas H. Reagan and S. W.

Senator Jones of Nevada and Governor
Hauser of Montana were on the train, but
not of the party. Senator Hill. ex-Gov
ernor Russeil and ex-Lieuten*nt-Governor
Sheeban will ioin Mr. Whitney at Albany.
A delegation of Tammanyites saw the
train off. Mr. Whitney said that he
did not know what they could do at Chi
cago. ''There is nothing to be said now,"
he said; "ifhas all been said before. We
are going to do tbe best we can."
Senator Gray said: "I expect there will
be a silver plank in the Chicago platform,
but no one knows yet I don't think Gov
ernor AUfseld will be as big when the New
Yorkers get there as he is now."
RETORT TO A BANKER.
Delegate O'Donnell's Reply to a Re
quest That He Renounce
Silver.
DENVER. Colo.. July 2.â Hon. C. S.
Thomas, National Committeeman, leaves
on .Friday night for Chicago. As a dele
gate from Colorado he will probably go
upon the platform committee. He says
that any candidate will suit him if all
right on tbe financial question. The logic
of the political situation, he believes,
points to Governor Matthews of Indiana
as the best man, though now Biand seems
to have the best showing. He believes
Vice-President Stevenson would make
good timber.
Hon. T. J. 0 Donnell, delegate- at-larpe
from Colorado, left for Chicago to-day.
Before leaving he mailed a reply to a let
ter from N. W. Harris <fe Co., bankers,
under a recent Chicago date, urging him
to wore for a financial plank to maintain
the gold standard, giving as his reason
that tbe firm had so far invested $777,000
in Colorado, and stood ready to do more
of this when the financial question had
been settled. In his reply Mr. O'Donneil
says:
Your draft upon the principle, patriotism
and integrity of tbe Democracy must be re
fused. Reason: No authority to draw;
stranger to us; no confidence In your re
sources of ideas or political tenets. You can
not purchase the sovereign right of the peo
ple of Colorado to take that part in the gov
ernment of tbe Republic guaranteed them by
the constitution for $ TTiOOOi A duplication
of your boasted totsi investments of $110,000,
-000 in the West and South will not serve now
to swerve tbe Democracy of those sections one
iota from tbe straight path of duty. Tbe gov
ernment of this country has been left too lone
in the hands of bankers and bond-dealers. If
any additional reason were needed to justify
thelt decision It would be furnished by such
letters as yours. I leave to-night for Chicago
to assist the militant Democracy of the South
and West in preparing a declaration ot inde
t>endencÂ«, which shall be free coinage, 16 to 1,
regardless of any other nation on earth or
syndicate of bankers and money-lenders.
WILL INCALLS BOLT?
Kansas Repub. leans Fear He Will
Repudiate the Cold Plank in
the Platform.
TOPEKA, Kass.. July 2.â The Republi
can State League Convention, which met
here yesterday, was the smallest in point of
numbers that bas been held sinoe tbe
league's organization, less than 400 dele
gales being in attendance. Edward Madi
son of Dodge City was elected president
and Oscar Swayze of Topeka secretary for
the ensuing year. The resolutions in
dorsed tbe National platform as adopted
at St. Louis.
The evening session was addressed by
General Charles H. Grosvenor of Ohio.
Ex-Senator John J. Ingalls was in the
city most of the day, and it was expected
that he would address the convention,
but he left the city without warning and
disappointed tbe delegate*. He abso
lutely refused to define his position on the
money question, replying. "I am a Re
publican." Inealls has always been an
outspoken advocate of free coinage, and
Republican leaders fear be will repudiate
the goid plank of the party platform.

FOR BLAND
AND BOIES,
Peculiar Stories Afloat Con
cerning the Two
Candidates.
WHAT STONE DID SAY.
Reports That Gold-Standard Men
Favor the lowan Are
Denied.
BOOMERS BY THE THOUSAND.
Chicago to Be Invaded and Kept in
Turmoil By the Supporters
of Aspirants.
CHICAGO, lib, July 2.â The story was
carried to the Boies headquarters during
the afternoon by newspaper and other
visitors that Governor Stone had made a
formal statement for publication, insinuat
ing that the lowa candidate was asking
favors from tbe Eastern gold delegates
and countiug on their votes, and that, j
therefore, tie was not a safe man for the
radical free-silver following to rally round.
What the Missouri Governor did say, in I
connection with his statement making ,
plain tbe friendly position of Bland toward
laboring men, was this:
"I have heard the report that tbe East
ern gold standard delegates were tending
toward Governor Boies, but I know noth
ing as to its truth. Mr. Bland's stand is
the personification of the free-coinage idea, '
and it is utterly impossible in the very
natr.ro of things that there should be an
aliiance between him and the single
gold-standard people. If he is nomi
nated he will be nominated by the
votes of delegates elected as Irre-eilver
coinage men. I am sure Mr. Bland's
nomination would be opposed to tbe ut
most and bis defeat sougtit by every
means possible by the gold power. The j
States represented here by single eold
standard delegations will not probably
cast a single electoral vote for the nomi
nee of the convention. If Mr. Bland is
nominated it will be by the delegates from
the States whose electoral votes must be re
lied on for success at tue polls."
GL A. Walsh, secretary of the lowa State
Committee and chief of the Boies forces in
tbe temporary absence of Captain Evans,
who has gone to lowa to bring down a '
host of Boies people, said when he heard !
the report that Governor Stone nad at
tacked Mr. Boies covertly as the gold \
men's choice that he would not believe
any such story until he nad seen it in |
black aud white. To a reporter Mr. Walsh '
added :
''I have reason to feel convinced that
Governor Stejie is too much of a friend of
Mr. Boies to attack him. I could show
you documentary evidence of this fact.
We have also received at our headquarters
here from Southern Democrats of promi
nence, delegates and others, letters which
show that Mr. Biand will not get all the
Souttieru votes claimed for him by his
shouting and sanguiue boomers here.
These writers say that lowa's Governor is
tbe logical candidate of such a convention
as this will be; but while the delegates do
not commit themselves as to voting lor
Horace Boies, it is plain that they are not
bound by any Bland pledge."
"Will you make any estimate of the vote
for Mr. Boies by States?"
"There will be no Boies figures given
out here officially, because it is idle work
at present to do so, and we do not want to
appear ridiculous ot boastful, while not
afraid to make comparisons. The votes
claimed for Mr. Bland are mainly in the
air. Why, the delegations, with a few ex
ceptions, are not here and have not been
polled as to candidate?. When it comes
to vote-getting we wiil show our rivals
what the Boies boom is like. We have
established one headquarters for the pub
lic. When our little army gets here from
every lowa crossroads then you will hear
more about Boies."
Telegrams were received to-day by Ser
geant-at-Arms Butler of the lowa delega
tion and headquarters that 1000 Boies men
would leave Ottumwafrom that section of
the Slate Sunday morning and arrive here
with a band at 4 o'clock. Saturday even
ing 300 more Democrats of tbe same kind
will arrive from Burlington, Mount Pleas
ant and other towns in the southeastern
part of tbe State. By Monday night tbe
lowa visitors to the convention are ex
pected to number between 8000 and 10,000.
The gold men's Illinois executive com
mittee will open new and elaborate quar
ters at the Palmer House, near the New
York parlor, and will leave nothing un
done to step into the Coliseum with a gold
delegation if there is any chance. Other
wise they will content themselves with
joining forces with the Eastern Demo
crats and worrying the silver delegates all
they can. The executive committee of
seven at a meeting this morning decided
to increase their membership to fifteen,
adding the following: Senator John M.
Palmer, Comptroller of the Currency
Eckels, ex-Congressman W. S. Forman,
ex-Judge Thomas A. Moran. Franslin
MacVeagh, ex- Mayor John & Hopkins
and Henry S. Robins.
A conspicuous addition to tbe gold forces
was ex -Governor George W. Peck of Wis
consin, who arrived at the Palmer House
and talked with every gold advocate of in
fluence. To The United Press the Gov
ernor said:
"I came from Milwaukee to look after
the opening of the Wisconsin headquar
ters. We are coming here with our gold
ideas solidly fixed to join tbe Democratic
proce-sion. It lakes gold to keep silver
moving, you know. Tbe Wisconsin dele
gation will abide by the will of tbe major
ity, as Democrats usually do, but we are
none the less gold tighter*."
General Bragg will be here next Monday
and the remainder of the Wisconsin dele
gation will arrive Sunday.
Chairman Harrity of the National Com
mittee talked privately in the Palmer
House headquarters and at the Wellington
Hotel, where he is registered, with a large
number of potiticians, gold and silver, and
he was in tbe greatest demand among ail
the famous Democrats in Chicago because
he was recocnized as the leader of th-e gold
forces until tbe arrival of Mr. Whitney to
morrow afternoon.
Ben T. Cable, tbe gold advocate from
Illinois en the National Committee, ax
rived from Virginia in time to get into
conference with Mr. Harrity on the tem
porary organization. Neither of them
would say who was his choice for chair
man pro tern. The New York leaders are
expected to settle that question and the
National Committee will agree with its
gold majority. That there is going to be
a gold standard chairman presented by
the committee is considered certain. On
this line Chairman Harrity said to The
United Press tbis afternoon:
"I don't think they can turn down the
:emporary chairman elected by the Na
tional Committee. I don't believe the
two-thirds rule will be abrogated by the
convention. It will not be considered by
the commitiee. That remains for the
rules committee to pass upon. Our fight
will be made on the platform, and we will
io the best we can. The contests will be
decided in the usual manner, but there
ire not enough of them to make a fuss
about."
There will be no meeting of the Na
tional sub-committee until the neon hour
Monday, when the full committee con
venes. When Secretary of State Hinrich
sen, the Illinois silver leader, in the ab
sence of Governor Altgeld, was asked
about a story that the Governor haa given
promises to tbe agents of Senator Teller
he declared emphatically:
"There is absolutely no truth in that
story. In the first place Teller is not a
candidate and would not accept a nomina
tion if it were tendered him. Of course,
the boys have been working for his nomi
nation, but their action has not his ap
proval. I know that the friends of silver
all over the country and Teller's own
friends feel that the Senator could not
afford to take the nomination if it were
offered him. I know from people who are
close to him tbat be has made up his mind
that under no circumstances would he ac
cept. I know, further, that he thinks it
would be wisest to nominate someone who
is not only a pronounced silver man, but a
Democrat also."
ExCongressman Bynum of Indiana,
who has engaged quarters at the Palmer
House for the use of a gold standard dele
gation from Indianapolis, said to-day:
'The Indiana political sentiment is over
whelmingly against free silver. I don't
expect a bolt. The Indiana delegates are
not that kind, although four are opposed
to tbe silver idea; but they might vote
for an independent sound money candi
date. I look for such a convention among
the sound money Democrats, but it will
hardly be called by tbe sound money del
egates to this convention."
John R. McLean, whose name is numer
onsly mentioned for both places on the
ticket, providing either nomination falls
to tbe good fortune of Ohio, came into the
city this afternoon, and his parlors in the
Auditorium annex were quickly tilled with
friends, political and personal, and poli
ticians who wanted to exchange views of
the situation.
SILVER MEN VERY ALERT.
Furnished With Duplicates of the
Credentials of All the Del-
egates Elected.
CHICAGO, 111., July 2.â The sub-com
mittee of the National bimetallic commit-
tee held an informal meeting this morn
ing and issued a call for a meeting of tne
general committee and of all silver dele
gates on the ground to-morrow nigt.t.
The mail of the committee was unusually
heavy to-day and in it were the credentials
of some fifteen silver State delegates.
This brought about tbe development, and
which has been hitherto kept secret, that
months since the National bimetallic com
mittee laid plans by wbich it should be
furnished with signed duplicates of the
credentials of every set of silver delegates
elected to the convention from each State
and Territory. These duplicates are in
every respect a counterpart of the
original!) aud are not even indorsed a3
"duplicates," and hence may be used as
original credentials if occasion requires.
When asked for an explanation of this
Secretary Towles said :
"There are some practical politicians as
well as practical statesmen on this com- !
mittoe and we have not been overlooking ;
anything. Sometimes, you know, papers |
get mislaid and confusions and complica
tions result. Nothing of the kind will
happen so far as we are concerned. Of
every set of credentials issued to a delega
tion at large or to a district delegation we
have here its counterpart. One cannot be
told from the other. If any of our people
lose their papers we can supply the
deficiency. Moreover we know just how
these delegates are instructed and where
they are expected to stand when they get
here."
Ex-Governor J. E. Oiborn of Wyoming,
the only Democratic executive whicn that
State has haa since its admission in 1890,
and who was elected in spite of the fact
that the State went Republican on
National issues in 1592, arrived at the
Sherman House this morning. He is
chairman of tbe delegation of six chosen
by the State Convention. To a representa
tive of the United Press he said :
"Politica 1 issues have been lost sight of
in Wyoming for the time being and the
question is simply one of silver against
gold. The State will go for whoever may
be the silver fandidate. We have no
choice, but whoever is nominated by this
conrention upon a silver platform will re
ceive the electoral vote of Wyoming. For
myself I would prefer a free- silver Demo
crat, but if we cannot get one we would
tafce Senator Teller or any one, so long as
it is a free-siltier ticket and a free-silver
candidate.
The Wyoming delegation will open
headquarters at the Palmer House on
I Monday.
Among the leading silver men here to
night the sentiment is expressed that the
convention will last not longer than three
days and possibly only two. Every effort
to bring about this result as far as can be
done by perfecting arrangements to that
end in advance is now being done by con
sultations with in-coming delegates, upon
whom tbe idea is impressed.
A new name is mentioned to-night for
temporary chairman. It is that of Charles
S. Thomas of Colorado, National Commit
i teeman from that State. Mr. Thomas ia a
i silver man, of course, a man of command
ing figure, excellent voice, firm and a good
parliamentarian. Other silver men men
tioned for the place are Governor Stone
of Missouri, ex-Congressman Money of
Mississippi, ex-Speaker Crisp of Georgia
! and W. J. Brvan, editor of the Omaha
| World-Herald.
I The consensus of opinion among delegates
: seen to-night is that the silver men will
insist upon one of their creed being made
temporary chairman of the convention.
S. A. Ramsay, a leader of the gold stand
ard delegation from South Dakota, ar
rived at tbe Palmer House this morning
| from his home in Woonsoctet. The other
J seven members of the delegation will come
lin singly between now and Mouday. Mr.
I Ramsay said to a United Press reporter:
"A sound money resolution was adopted
by our convention. The silver faction
I took part in the proceedings, and after :he
resolution went through they went out
into a corner and pretended to elect a con
-1 testing delegation to Chicago. I don't
think they have any valid claim for recog
nttion by the National Committee or the
committee on credentials. Tne regular
delegates are not instructed on the finan
cial question or as to the Presidential
candidate, but they will vote for a sound
money plank, and if the silver men win,
as I suppose they will, then I and the
other delegates, I think, will vote for the
best silver man who is put up. We will
know when and where to jump, but we
don't want any Republican or ex-Republi
can silver man. We will have nothing to
do with any bolting scherae."
Tlie Bland men are counting on the
votes of South Dakota.
WILL URGE FUSION.
One County Convention of Colo-
rado Populists Shows Friendli
ness to the Democrats.
DENVER, Colo., July 2.â The County
Convention of the People's party to-day
selected delegates to the State Convention
and passed brief resolutions delaring that
the eilver issue is the most important
question and urging all people to unite
upon that issue, waiving party fealty if
necessary. The National Convention in
St. Louis is urged to make no antagonism
to the Democratic party if it shall set up a
silver candidate on a silver platform. Rev.
Myron W. Reed. Hon. Lafe Pence and
Hon. T. M. Patterson addressed the con
vention, urging a union of all Mlver forces.
Mr. Reed said : "The Republican party
must be destroyed, as it ia the chief enemy
of the human race."
Mr. Pence saw a rapid growth of the
silver sentiment in the East, but doubted
a victory unless the People's party showed
its true spirit by joining with the Demo
crats upon this issue.
Ex-Governor Waite, with two of the
officers of liis administration and a small
coterie of genuine middle-of-the-road
Populists, held a rival County Convention
and declared for the strictest party
autonomy. The delegates declare they
will contest for seats in St. Louis if denied
representation in the State Convention.
The action of the Populists of the main
convention to-day foreshadows the action
of the State Convention next Saturday,
which will urge fusion as to the electoral
ticket.
BLACKBURN WANTS IT.
The Senator's Boom Nurtured and
Fostered Awaiting the Battle's
Opening.
CHICAGO, 111., July 2.â United States
Senator Blackburn is the only delegate to
attend the convention preliminaries who
is an active Presidential candidate. His
interests are being carefully preserved and
nurtured into enthusiasm by his friend,
Phil Thompson Jr. of New York. The
two have qu:ir:ers adjoining in the Audi
torium annex and much quiet work was
done to-day. The genial Senator declines
to do any talking for publication, consid
ering his name will be presented to the
convention. The Senator's position on
the question of dispensing with the two
thirds rule is that there is no use trying to
suspend the time-boncred rule until the
necessity for sucb action presents itself
during the balloting.
By appointment Senator Dutois of the
boltiug Republican contingent called on
Senator Blackburn at his apartments and
held a secret conference in the presence of
Phil Thompson which lasted considerable
time. The Idaho Senator's visit was in
the interests of his leader, Senator Teller,
and it is presumed that the contingent
support of the Blackburn strength was
asked for the Colorado Senator. It is a
fact, confirmed by tbe admission of Sena
tor BlacKburn, that tbe South feels very
kindly toward benator Teller, especially
because of bis fight in the Senate against
tbe Lodge force bill, but among the
Southern old line Democrats, irrespective
of the money question, it would be a
difficult task to create a sentiment favor
able to voting for a man who only a few
days ago was a Republican partisan.
Colonel Thompson, as the spokesman for
the Kentucky Senator, said to a United
Press reporter this afternoon:
"Senator Blackburn will be put forward
Iby tbe Kentucky State delegation for
I President by the unanimous action of the
delegation sent there, of which he is the
head. They are instructed for him and
v,e frill remain in tlie fight to the end,
carrying it on in tbe same manner which
characterized former successful contests
in which the Senator has engaged. He
has been promised the support of several
State delegations and the individual sup
i port of some delegates from several other
States. We do not care to mention names
!or trive figures yet. Mr. Blackburn bas
been an ardent and consistent advocate of !
the free coinage of silver for twenty-two
years. His recent victory in the State
Convention on the silver issue against the
combined forces of tbe administration
snow that he is the most popular man in
Kentucky public life and a proper man to
be at the gold ring in November."

IN CLEVELAND,
A Striker Shot and Killed
by a Non-Union
Workman.
POLICE TO THE RESCUE.
Laborers Shielded From a Riot
ous Mob by the City's
Guardians.
MILITIAMEN PUT ON GUARD.
Disorderly Crowds of Men and Women
Beaten and Dispersed by
Policemen.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 2.â 8100 d was
again shed during the trouble at the
Brown Hoisting works this afternoon.
William Rottger was shot and instantly
killed by a non-union workman, who at
tempted to leave the works on his bicycle
and was attacked by a portion of the mob.
The police succeeded in rescuing the
shooter and were then besieged in a shop
and had great difficulty in preventing the
lynching of their prisoner. Finally a call
for troops was made and two of the four
companies under arms were hurried to
the scene. The prisoner was finally
loaded into a patrol wagon and about
7:30 to-night was locked up in the Central
police station.
The troops are on guard and there is a
sullen mob of at least 10,000 hanging
around the premises.
Shortly before the hour for Quitting
work several strikers marched up to the
Brown Works with big banners, on
which was written in large letters "Brown
Scabs."
At 4:30 o'clock the main body of the
workmen were marshaled into line and
the police force formed the usual hollow
square. Captain English gave the word,
the gates were opened and the solid body
of workmen, surrounded by 150 policemen,
with clubs in hand, marched out.
The crowd gave way and the procession
moved up Hamilton street to Case on the
way to the St Clair-street cars. The
crowd followed, as on Wednesday even
ing, yelling "'scab' 1 and making a lively
vocal demonstration. Contrary to the
Mayor's declaration, the police could not
drive back the following mob. At least
they allowed it to follow them up Hamil
ton street. The police marched to the
Fourth Precinct station, where they made
a halt. Forming two lines, they allowed
the workmen to enter the station.
All being out of the way. the police
formed again across the street. At this
moment the following party was a dense
black crowd reaching far down Wilson
avenue. Suddenly the word "Charge!"
was given. It rang out loud and clear,
aud an awful scene followed. The police
pressed forward like a shot out of a gun.
In a moment they were upon the van
guard of the crowd. The latter were dam
founded. There was a waver, and then
all turned and fled.
The batons of the police were failing
like hail on the heads of the men. The
crowd was panic - stricken. Two cars
blocked the way north of Wilson avenne,
and the men, women and children were
packed together in a tight mass, yelling
and shrieking. One part broke 3way and
ran down the Cleveland and Pittsburg
tracks, close at hand. Another went
south on Wilson avenue. Men were lying
unconscious on the street or crawling
around in a vain attempt to rise to their
feet The police, dividing into squads,
charged after each section of the crowd,
determined to inflict punishment severe
and unrelenting. This lasted for several
minutes, and then returning squads of
I'Olicemen began to gather up unconscious
men and others who were staggering
around as the result of severe blows.
Ten students of the School of Applied
Sciences have been engaged at the hoist
ing works, but there has been no dispo
sition to molest them. Each day they
have, after the police marched out the
other workmen, mounted their wheels and
gone home. This afternoon A. G. Saun
ders, aged 19, one of the boys, was
later than his companions in leaving, and
when be followed the crowd which was in
pursuit of the police ho was assailed with
cries of "scab" and stones were thrown at
him. When he had reached a point about
a block away, in front of the Bishop Iron
Works, he was struck by a stone and an
awful gash cut in his head. He fell from
his wheel, the mob shouted "Kill the
scab !" and made a rush for him.
As he lay he drew a revolver and shot
Rottger through the heart. The squad of
police left to guard the Brown works wit
nessed the shooting and charted down the
street, managing to reach Saunders, who
was again on the ground being kicked and
buffeted.
The police drew their revolvers and
managed by great effort to get the in
jured man into the office of the Bishop
Works. The rcob outside, which had
swelled to 3000, infuriated by the sight of
the dead man, how!ed "Lynch him!" and
were preparing to make a charge on the
building in which the police had taken
refuge when a re-enforcement came up,
attacked the crowd in the rear and clubbed
their way to where the imprisoned officers
wore standing off the crowd. They man
aged to keep the mob at bay until a com
pany of militia marched to the scene and
took Saunders to the Central police sta
tion.
The section of the city where the work
men live is in a state of ferment to-night,
and threats were made to burn the houses
where the men who have returned to work
live before morning. The police are on
the alert and the streets are being rigidly
ratrolled. There is also apprehension
that the trouble has only begun and that
a strike of ironworkers, embracing every
branch of that industry in Cleveland, may
come about at any moment.
The American Wire Company plant,
which has been idle for some months on
account of a lockout, has been surrounded
with a ten-foot fence, and the company
will open up n-xt week with non-union
men. If this is done more noting is cer
tain to occur.
Four companies of militia are under
arms at their respective armories and will
he used to keep the peace to-morrow. The
Brown Company is as firm as ever in its
announced intention not to recognise the
union.
After the police had escorted the work
men to the Fourth Precinct station at
Wilson and Euciid avenues, the mob,
which had followed all the way, was re-en
forced by thousands of workmen returning
from other shops, and both streets were
packed. Deputy Police Superintendent
McMahon ordered the streets cleared, and
fifty policemen, under command of Cap
tain English, were lined up.
Batons were drawn and when the order
"Charge" was given there ensued the
most terrific exhibition of clubbing that
Cleveland has ever known. The police,
who were tired from their long extra
labors, fought viciously, and soon 100 men
were either lyin<: on the ground, or crawl
ing, or being carried away. The mob
broke and soon Wilson avenue was cleared.
The police were lined up and another
charge made into Euclid avenue, where
another tierce clubbing ensued. This
seemed to break the mob's spirit, and the
crowd finally dispersed, and the workmen
who were in the station were sent to their
homes under police protection. During
the fight the police captured five of their
assailants, each of whom was in a bad
condition from the beating he had re
ceived.
William Hearn, a furniture van driver,
allowed the strikers to crowd into his
wagon, and tnen crying "Give them hell!"
drove right into the police line with nis
horses on a run. Several policemen were
knocked down betore the team was cap
tured. Hearn was dragged from the
wagon and clubbed into insensibility be
fore he could be carried into the station.
His skull was fractured and his face Â«nd
head cut and bruised fearfully. Steve
O'Neill was also on the wagon and has a
broken head and a broken leg.
Hermann Schaels, a blacksmith, has a
terribly cut head and was badly hurt by
being trampled on. James Fox and
Charles Cupoenbecker were each badly cut
about the head. Charges of rioting were
preferred against the five prisoners. The
mob managed to carry away all the others
who were so injured as to be unable to
walk. A conservative estimate is that
fifty men were severely injured by the
clubbicg.
Quiet at Boca.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 2.â The pres
ence of troops at Boca had a restraining
influence on affairs at the quarries there
to-day. The Sheriff, with 100 deputies
and the two companies of State troops, are
still on guard.
ALMOST A HOLOCAUST.
Narrow Escape of a Dakota
Town From Being Swept
by a Flood.
A Canal Bank Bursts and Water
Overflows the Freight Depot
of a Railroad.
EDGMONT, S. D., July 2.â Last night
the Edgmont irrigating canal bank oroke
south of town and an enormous amount
of water poured down the hill into the old
bed of the creek where the Burlington
Railroad Company has but lately erected
its freighthouse. The water rose until
within ten feet of the top of the fill, when
the ground broke through. Before the
flood, which was almost irresistible, could
be controlled it washed a hole sixty feet
long and many feet deep. The embank
ment had been inspected .on Tuesday last
and found to be in good condition, and on
the strength of this an extra amount of
water bad been turned in. The damage
to the canal is almost complete, while the
Burlington loss is very heavy.
The city escaped the flood by almost a
miracle, as owing to the pressure of water
the embankment above town proved to be
weak in one place. But for the providen
tial breaking of the embankment where it
did the town would have been flooded
with consequent loss ot life and enormous
damage. Two cloudbursts occurred to-day
near tne city and all streams are running
over.
HEATH OF GENERAL LANTON.
Jhe Confederate Commander Was Stricken
by Paralysis.
CLIFTON SPRINGS, N. V., July 2.â
General A. R. Lawton of Savannah, Ga.,
died at thft Clifton Springs sanitarium this
morning. He was stricken by paralysis
on Friday last and never rallied. He was
Colonel of, the First Regiment of Georgia
Volunteers, when in January, 1861, he
took possession of Fort Puiaski, under
State authority. At the commencement
of hostilities in the following April he re
ceived a commission as brigadier-general
in the Confederate army, and up to the
close of the rebellion was in constant mili
tary service.
After the fall of Richmond General
Lawton returned to Savannah and re
sumed the practice of law. HewasMin
ister to Austiia under the first Cleveland
administration.
DARING CHICAGO FOOTEARS.
Their fourteenth Successful Exploit Was
the Hold- Up of a Drugttore.
CHICAGO, 111., July 2. â The "Inng"
and the "short" man continued operations
here to-night and did their fourteenth job
in the line of holding up stores.
At 9:30 o'clock to-night the two men en
tered the drugstore of A. B. Lane at 1202
Wabash avenue. Going up to Walter
Kotz, one of the clerks, they covered him
with their revolvers and ordered him to
hand over the cash- The smaller of the
two men said to the clerk* "I am the
short man and am a little short of cash.
Please produce." Kotz went to the cash
drnwer and banded over between $50 and
$75 without protest. The men left and
pursued by Harry Butler, another clerk
in the store, but easily escaped, and the
police are still looking for the robbers.
Ytry Quiet Wedding at Eureka.
EUREKA, Cal., July 2.â Shortly after

a very quiet wedding was solemnized by
Rev.'William Leacock. The contracting
parties were Htfwell W. Lonnsberry of
Oakland and Amy D. Soule of Eureka.
The bride is the handsome and accom
plished daughter of Banker C. P. Soule of
this city, and the groom is a rising young
business man of Oakland. After the cere
mony the happy couple left on the Po
mona for their home in Oakland.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 3, 1896.
MANY RECORDS
WILL BE BROKEN
Splendid Entry List for
Stockton's Carnival
of Sport.
OCCURS ON JULY FOURTH
Seventy - Eigfct Athletes Will
Compete in the Field
Games.
SEVERAL CHAMPIONS LISTED.
Bicycling, Foot and Hurdle Racing in
the Afternoon and Boxing
at Night.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jnly 2.â The coming
carnival of sport on the Fourth of July
promises to be the greatest event of the
kind ever held in the West. In the field
day games there are seventy-eight entries,
exclusive of the fifteen entries in the two
bicycle events, and if some records are not
lowered the knowing ones will be badly
mistaken.
Cheek, of tne Academic Athletic League,
has his heart set on lowering the coast
record for the shot put. The Olympic
Club tried its best to get him to go to Port
land, but he preferred to save his energies
for the games here, and he will give a
creditable account of himself on the after
noon of the Fourth.
Last year Robert Edgren broke the coast
record for the hammer throw at the field
day games held here, and this year he will
probably eclipse the great record he made
in his trial in San Francisco. He has
promised to lower the world's amateur
record for the 56-pound shot, and all who
know the stalwart athlete's ability in this
line do not doubt that he will do it.
Then there is the half-mile run, in
which fourteen men will start. Tom Car
keek of Stockton will lower the Coast rec
ord if he is given half a show, He is anx
ious to make a record for Stockton, and
has been training hard for the event. He
is one of the best all-round amateur ath
letes on the coast to-day and the Stockton
Athletic Association is willing to match
him with any amateur on the coast in a
catch-as-catch-can wrestling bout. He
has entered in all of the running events
except the mile and 220-yard hurdle race,
and may be depended upon to give a good
account of himself.
Cheek has entered in the pole vault and
high jump, and is expected to do some
thing phenomenal for his team.
Stanford has also some eood men en
tered. Fred Butz of the Olympic Club
has his name down for all the sprints. He
will have a rival in Wilhite of Modesto,
who is a member of the Stockton Athletic
Association and will wear the blue and
white of that club.
Excursions will be run from Sacra
mento, Antioch, Tracy, Merced, Fresno
and Modesto on the Fourth for the carni
val of sport, and Stockton will be filled
with strangers. Already accommodations
have been secured in all the leading hotels
for the visitors.
Almost as much interest centers in the
boxing tournament that is to come off at
night as in anything else. Van Buskirk
has vowed to knock Corrigan out inside
the allotted six rounds, and if condition
counts there is little doubt that he will not
do so. He is extremely anxious to win
laurels in the professional ring, and wants
to challenge Sbarkey, who will spar here
with Needham at the boxing tournament.
On that night Van Buskirk will issue a
challenge to Bharkev, and the two may be
brought together. Sharkey will be the
best man the ex-amateur cv r went up
against, but Van Buskirk is confident he
can win against the sailor in a finish fight
or in one of a sufficient number of rounds.
The big Olympian is in better trim than
he ever was in his life. As he has an ideal
place for training and is making good use
of it he should soon be a better man than
he ever was.
Tom Berry is in training at the same
place for his eight-round go with Charley
Turner. The latter has' promised to re
deem himself in the eyes of his erstwhile
Stockton admirers, and they are anxiously
waiting to see what the wreck of their
former idol can do.
One of the contests that is creating
much excitement is that between Jack
Hopkins, who once bested Solly Smith,
and Ben Maxwell, a colored pugilist.
This is scheduled to last eight rounds, but
few expect it to continue longer than six.
The lists are full for the regatta that is
to come off on the morning of the Fourth.
The great disappointment is that the
champion senior South End crew did not
keep their recent promise made to come
here and compete against the Giant crew
of Stockton. The local men offered to
pay their expenses, and to offer individual
medals, besides a trophy, for the contest.
The South Ends said that they wanted
mecials, and this point was waived. Even
then they did not enter and have only
sent a crew to go in the intermediate class.
This has caused much comment, as the
Qiants were only juniors at the Â£1 Campo
races.
The new barge has been fitted up and
the seniors from the Stockton Athletic
Association are ready to pull the race of
their lives. There are enough entries in
the other events to make the regatta a
great success, and the channel will be
lined on the morning of the Fourth with
thousands of spectators.
JOE PATCHEN WON EASILY.
He Beat John R. Gentry in Two Straight
Heats Paced in Fast
Time.
CHICAGO, lil., July 2.â The match
race between John R. Gentry, 2:03)4, and
Joe Patchen, 2:04, proved to be something
of a fizzle at Washington Park to-day.
Patchen drew the pole for the first Heat
and simply romped away from Gentry.
It might have been a close race to the
wire had Andrews been able to liold Gen
try on bis feet, but at the eighth pole he
broke and Patcben simply cantered in
tue easiest of winners. Gentry was greatly
distressed after the heat and when it came
to scoring with the big black fellow soon
after it was plainly Patchen's day. The
latter had a neck the better of it when the
word was gven for the second heat and he
never relinauished the lead, sroine out at
the quarter and killing off the Gentry
horse, who broke at tne eighth pole and
allowed Patchen to romp in aguin.
The other events were uneventful and

THE PRINCE'S HORSE BEATEN.
He Failed to Win the Princess Stake at
Newmarket.
LONDON, Esq., July 2.â lt was a glor
ious Rothschild day at Newmarket for the
big race. The purse being up was the
Princess of Wales stake of 10,000 sovereigns.
Persimmons, owned by the Prince of
Wales and winner of the Derby, was en
tered. Many of those in attendance looked
upon him as a sure winner. The know
ing ones, however, did not overlook the
fact that Regret, owned by the Duke of
Westminster, and Leopold Rothschild's
St. Frusquin was also on the cards. The
condition of the track favored Persimmons.
The three horses started well together,
and for a while it was doubtful as to the
outcome. In the stretch, however, St.
Frupquin showed up the fresher and
finished first, with Persimmons second and
Regret third. The result was not a popu
lar one, as many hoped the Prince's horse
would win the Princess stake.

Joseph Berger Relates a Tale of
Sad Experience in the
Antilles.

Dinner, Fever for Suppsr,
the Routine.
SEATTLE, WW t ash., July 2. â Joseph
Berger, a cahle and telegraph operator
who spent three months in the Cuban
army and made his escape from the island
during a Spanish attack, in which he
came near losing his life, passed through
Seattle to-day en route to Southern Cali
fornia.
His duties while in Cuba were to accom
pany a division of the insurgent army, tap
telegraph wires when the opportunity was
presented, copy dispatches as they passed
through, and thus pain knowledge of the
enemy's plans. Occasionally they held an
office for a short time and once were in
possession of the cable office at Batabano
and telegraphed glowing accounts of in
surgent victories that never occurred. In
this connection he says both sides are
doing all in their power to send out false
reports, in order to deceive outsiders re
garding the condition of things on the
island.
"In the hands of the insurgents," said
Berger, "are about 2500â not oVer 4000 at
most â stands of modern arms, but they
have a large number of old flintlock rifles
and blunderbusses. Of supply trains
going into the interior about nine out of
ten are captured by the insurgents, bufc on
the other hand nearly all consignments
intended for the rebels are captured by
the Spaniards.
"Excepting the food taken by the rebels
from the Spaniards, the patriots live on
lizards and snakes; but they are in con
dition to withstand the fever, which is
killing off the Spaniards, a march of
three miles being sufficient to incapacitate
most soldiers. The plan of the insurgents
is to starve the Spanish soldiers out of the
interior, which they now hold with gar
risons and ample artillery.
"The treatment of prisoners is barbarous
on both sides, bodies being Dadly muti
lated whether there is life in them or not."'
Berger, referring to the manner of his
escape, said that on May 2 he accompa
nied a troop of soldiers to the beach on the
western slope of the island to receive fire
arms irom a schooner. The schooner was
about to land the goods in small boats,
when the Spaniards suddenly appeared,
killing the captain, some sailors and a
good many Cubans. He and two Cubans
escaped in a small boat to the schooner
and from there were taken to St. Marks,
Fla. After landing there he was stricken
with fever, but it proved to be a slight
attack, and upon his recovery he paid a
visit to the home of his parents in Great
Falls, Montj

The Panama Star and Herald, after re
viewing the treaties recently signed be
tween Chile and Argentine on the one
hand and Chile and Bolivia on the other,
says:
It now remains to be seen whether
Chile will deal with Peru and face the set
tlement of the Tacna-Arica question. It
is as clear as daylight that Chile cannot
retain them long now and its suits her and
every one to get it settled, whether or not
Pere can be wheedled or coerced into con
senting to Bolivia raking them. Whether
Peru is to gain her lost provinces and Bo
livia is to be satisfied with a slice to be cut
off the north of Tarapaca, which will give
her the desired outlet to the sea, is a prob
lem. T One way or another, it is time our
northern frontier was settled and we were
free of Tacna and Arica, which have been
nothing but an incumbrance to us; but
we freely acknowledge that the Peruvian
Government seems scarcely to possess the
necessary stability to deal with this ques
tion.
RAILWAY COMPANY ROBBED.
Conductors, Btation Agents and Porter*
Have Been Knocking 7>ou>n.
CHICAGO, 111., July 2.â Officials of the
Chicago and Alton Railroad have just dis
covered that a gang of employes, among
whom are passenger-train conductors and
station agents, working with Pullman-car
porters, have robbed the railway company
of $15,000. Sufficient investigation into
the gigantic steal has been made to show
a conspiracy, and thus far three con
ductors and two station agents have lost
their positions. Others may be dis
charged when the full extent of the con
spiracy is discovered. The company is
making all plans for ths criminal prosecu
tion of the offenders.
The steal was accomplished through the
co-operation of a station agent with
passenger conductors. It is said that the
conductors would take up tickets but not
punch them. The tickets would be re
turned to the agent, who would resell them
and divide the proceeds with the con
ductors.

MONTEREY'S BIG
CELEBRATION,
The Quaint Old Town Is
Aroused for the
Occasion.
ACTIVITY EVERYWHERE
Profusion of American Bunting
in Artistic Spanish
Designs.
THE LIVING FLAG A FEATURE.
Names of the Young Ladies Who
Will Compose Itâ Programme
of Exercises.
MONTEREY, Cal,, July 2.â The spirit
of '96 has at last awakened quaint old
sleepy Monterey, and every man, woman
and child in the town is bent on making
the coming semi-centennial jubilee cele
bration a grand success. The exercises of
the celebration will all be strongly Ameri
can in character, but so Spanish in inter
pretation that it is hard to tell where one
ends and the other begins.
All of ths building in Monterey are
riecorsted with American bunting, but so
arranged as to produce the architectural
effects of old Spain. Many of these deco
rations are highly artistic, and could some
of the old dons visit the scene they would
feel that they were thoroughly at home.
To-day has been a busy one for all who
will take part in the celebration, from Ad
miral Beardsiee to the smallest girl in the
"Living Flag." The people of the town
were awakene.l by the strains of martial
music from the bands of the two warships
out on the glistening blue waters of the
bay and in the two companies of artillery
in camp back of the Hotel del Monte. It
was a sound uncommon here, but none
the less welcome, and in a short time
everybody was awake and eaeer to prac
tice their part in the big celebration.
The military and naval men spent the
long hours of the day in drills and exer
cises, so as to bo ready for the ceremonies
of the Fourth of July, while the citizens
worked hard at decorating and preparing
their houses to receive the large number
of visitors expected.
The principal feature of the celebration
will be the "I.ivin-; Flag," which will be
composed of about "JOO young ladies dressed
in red. white and blue, who will march in
such order as to produce an exact repre
sentation of the stars and stripes.
Thie feature of the celebration has been
in charge of Hon. S. J. Duckworth and A.
W. Jones. To-day a rehearsal was held in
the opera-house and the young ladies went
through the intricate movements of the
exercise with tbe utmost precision aud
formed as beautiful a picture as oae could
want to see.
Part of the programme will consist of
singing the three National songs, "Amer
ica," "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean"
and '"The Star-spangled Banner." After
the rehearsal in the hall the entire com
pany of young ladies marched down the
street to the grand stand and went through
the same evolutions they will on the
Fourth and seventh. There was not a
hitch anywhere and everything was so
carefully studied that there can be no
doubt but the living flag will corer itself
with glory when the time comes.

ladies who will form the living flag:

up with guests for the celebration. The
grounds of the caravansary never looked
better than they do at present, and many
plans are on foot for the pleasure of the
guests. There will be a grand ball on
Saturday night and another on Tuesday
night. The ballroom will be decorated
with the National colors, interwoven with
the finest flowers produced on the hotel
grounds. A large number of army and

A LEAP YEAR WEDDING.,
Heir an Vnituspeetiny Steaim JTaÂ« Cap
tured by a Wily Senorita.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 2.âAccord
ing to tbe situation of at least one more or
less astute individual in Los Angeles the
gentleman is liable to get married entirely
unexpected to himself. Whether or not
the question of leap year has any bearing
on the case under consideration is un
known, but at all events the lady "did the
business" in a very expeditious manner
and in consequence has a substantial hus
band as the result of her cleverness. The
story follows:
Martin Tribarren of this city is the
groom, and Encamaclon V. Sanchez is the
blushing bride. The bride is known
among the 400 of the "lower part of town"
as Chona. On the 29th of June the lovely
Chona, who is strongly pockmarked and
has also a seductive cast in one of her
eyes, made application to Deputy County
Clerk McPherron for a marriage license.
This is an unusual step for a lady to secure
a document of such a nature/ But fair
Chona explained that by saying that Mar
tin was off to his feed. The lady was not
very well acquainted with her swain's
patronymic, as his name is given as Mar
tin Elizivare, aged 27, .fcnearnacion doling

SAN JOSEANS SWINDLES,
E. E. Klotzly, Proprietor of the
Russ House, Is Badly
Wanted.
A Widow Stopping at the Hotel and
His f Ãns Driver the Princi
pal Victims.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 2.â E. E. Klotrly,
who has been running the Russ House in
this city, is badly wanted by a large num
ber of creditors. Early in June Klotzly
induced Mrs. L. Laederich, a widow of
some means who was stopping at the
hotel, to purchase a half interest in the
hotel business for |1000. He represented
that he needed the money to pay off a
mortgage of $700 held by O. A. Hale, and,
as the investment seemed a good one, Mrs.
Laederich handed over the $1000, and on
June 2 the papers were signed transferring
to her a half-interest in the business,
which Klotzly said was free of debt.
On June 1G Klotzly went to Santa Cruz
to take in the water carnival, saving he
would be back In a week. At the end of
that time he failed to return, but as he
left his two children at the hotel nothing
was thought of his extended absence.
A few days aco Mrs. Laeaern -:i began
making inquiries and found that Klotzlv
had not only failed to pay the $700 mort
gage, as he represented he did, but there
were two additional mortgages aggregat
ing $480 standing against the business.
He also sold a large number of in-ai
tickets and pocketed the money, and also
left a large number of small debts unpaid
behind him.
Klotzly has evidently left the State, and
Mrs. Laedftrich is not only out $1000 in
cash but has inherited about the same
amount of indebtedness and the care of
two of her abscoTidinjj partner's children.
John Heffey, the bus-driver of the hotel,
also loses $700 which he loaned to Klotzly
on his personal note a short time ago.

three small children, has deserted his fam
ily, leaving them in destitute circum

vice of friends, but aside from a few days
work as a laborer was unable to secure
employment. He soon became discour
aged and a few days ago he took a roll of
blankets and left during bis wife's ab
sence. It is believed Campbell is making
his way to his former home in New York
afoot. Mrs. Campbell and the children
are dependent upon neighbors. She feels
confident that her husband will send for
her and the children as soon as he secures
employment.

TOBIN'S HANDWRITING.
Three Witnesses Testify to the
Genuineness of the
Receipt.
LEVY CONTINUES SKEPTICAL.
While It Is Considered Unnecessary,
the Defense Wi.l Introduce
Further Evidence.
VALLEJO, Cal., July 2.â At tbe Web
ster court-martial being held at the navy
yard this morning three witnesses intro
duced on behalf of the paymaster were
positive in their declaration, as much as
one could be, that the paper signed by W.
J. Tobin acknowledging receipt of $583 54
on account of loan was written entirely in
Tobin's own handwriting.
A letter written from Shanghai to a Mr.
Ramsey about the same time the receipt
was signed waa compared, and in all re
spects it was claimed to be written by one
and the same person. The witnesses in
troduced by the paymaster to establish
the identity c! the handwriting were a
paymaster's yeoman *rho had served on
the ship and J. R. English, cashier of the
Vallejo Commercial Bank, in which bank
Mr. Tobin was employed as a clerk under
the cashier. The other witness was George
Weniger, a brother-in-law of Mr. Tobin,
who succeeded him in the grocery busi
ness and has all the books and papers in
the store.
Being perfectly familiar with the band
writing of Mr. Tobin he had no hesitancy
in declaring the receipt was written en
tirely by him.
Notwithstanding this almost conclusive
testimony Paymaster Webster desired to
introduce further evidence, so there could
be no manner of doubt in the mind of the
court as to the genuineness of the receipt,
for upon this receipt he will base his claim
of having obtained the money from Mrs.
Tobin as a loan.
The court was asked for and granted a
continuance until 10 o'clock Friday morn
ing, at which time other witnesses will
be introduced to identify Tobin's hand
writing.
Cle-k Levy still adheres to his state
ment made on the stand yesterday after
noon, that the body of the receipt is not
that of Tobin's handwriting, though a
qualification is made that at the time, if
he wrote it, his nerves might have been
such as to cause a difference in the man
ner of his writing.
TO CLOSE FAIR AVALON.
The Banning Company Controls
the Destiny of Catalina
Island.
Will Withdraw Its Interests From
the Resort Owing to Lack of
Moral Support
AVALON, Catalixa Islawd, July 2.â
It is possible that the Banning Company
may withdraw their interests from Avalon
and locate a resort at some other point on
Catalina Island. This, if it comes to pass, j
will be brought about by the lack of moral j
support from property-holders at Avalon
who are at issue with the Banning Com
pany.
There are some sixty or eighty lots at
Avaion owned by private individuals. The
rest of the 55,000 acres comprising the
island belongs to the company.
At present the company is not able to
control things in a manner which they
consider commensurate with the amount
of capital expended in improvements, ex
pense of keeping up the resort, etc., and it
may lead to a removal.
Ihe Banning Company in that case
would simply fence in its property at
Avalon and by the use of laree rafts or
lighters remove such of their buildings as
are movable to some other point on the
islandâ say Whites Landing, which is a
beautiful and commodious cove, or tbe
isthmus, which by many is considered
more desirable as a location for a resort
than Avalon â and there buiid up a sum
mer resort and land their steamers there.
Then the property- holders of Avalon
conld run their own resort and encourage,
if they liked, any service that should suit i
them.
la regard to this matter Judge Banning
said :
"I should greatly regret being forced to
abandon Avalou, and we shall not go
unless compelled by lack of moral sup
-om Avalon resi-lents. The present
outlook is not encourasinjr. The policy
of the Banning Company, which has
made Cataiina Island famous and built
up the van.es of Avalon holders, does not
seem to be appreciated by many of them.
â¢'Yes, ii, is true onr investments here are
heavy, but not of such magnitude as to
compel the expenditure of more money or
prevent the company from establish iijg a
resor; at any point on the island should
necessity xequire it. I exceedingly regret
this unhappy state of affairs, but we shall
go ahead for this season, and, as usual, ao
our b^?t to accommodate and entertain
tor?.
"What about next season? Time will
tell."
CAPTAIN' BANNING'S PLAN
Say Bis Company Will Start m Rival
" Village.
LOS ANGELES. Cal.. July 2.â Captain
Banning of Banning- Bros., "owners "of
Catalina Island and operators of boats ply
ing between the island and mainland,
says that if opposition boats are put on
for traffic and passengers between Avalon
and San Pedro bis company will aban
don that town *to its fate and start a
rival village at Whites Landing. He says
that revenue from his monopoly is. abso
lutely necessary to maintain Avalon. A
few lots are held by other parties Â»nd they
can if they desire condemn right of
way to water, thus enablinz all boats to
land passengers. Captain Banning said
that whether his company would remove
depended ; entirely on " these people.
>othinjt will be done, however, this
season, for if suit is brought for right of
way for street it will be fought and staYed
off until fall. Everything except Hotel
Metropole and the pavilion can be re
moved.

PORTLAND, Ok.. July 2.â Portland is
attempting to celebrate the Fourth on an
elaborate plan and the three days' cele
bration which began to-day bids fair to

A SPECIER FROM THE DEEP.
British Bark Long Since Given Up for
Lost Appears.
PORT TOWNSEND Wash., July 2.â A
specter from the deep arose in the noon
report from Cape Fiattery to-day, which
brought the first tidings of the British
bark Cambusdoon, Captain McDonald,
which had long ago been given up for lost.
One hundred and seventy-one days ago
the Cambusdoon sailed from Java, bound
for British Columbia to load, and from
that time until to-day's report nothing
has been heard from her. Seventy guineas
had been offered in reinsurance on the
vessel. She will probably go in to Vic
toria.

KERN COUNTY BANDITS.
Crowley Appears at Caliente to
Register, That He May
Vote.
An Armed Man, Believed to Be Don
ham, Seen at a Camp Near
Bakersfield.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., July 2.â Bandit
Crowley has been heard from again. Some
time ago he sent word to Sheriff Borg
ward that he intended coming down from j
his hiding place in the mountains to reg- '
ister, so as to vote next fall. Sure enough,
a day or two ago he put in an appearance j
at Caliente, where there is a Deputy Reg- j
istrar, who, however, was absent, so that j
Crowley did not get his name on the reg- j
ister.
The bandit spent several hours th?reand
was not molested. He ate at the hotel,
drank beer and talked freely with several i
persons, making no secret of his identity. !
He denied having fired at Rankin's son, but
said he could have easily killed the Sheriff
the last time he was out, as he was in the
brush fifty feet from the road when that
officer passed along. The only man
against whom Crtfwley bears enmity is
Tom Castro, who betrayed him to the
otScers, and him he swears to kill on
sight.
Crowley says he was not the man who
made such a sensation near Haywardslast
fall, but that as boon as he escaped from
the insane asylum he came down here and
took up his quarters at Walker's Ba&in.
He worked a while for Sam Blades, one of
the men. whom he threatened to kill, but i
Blades would not pay him. So he robbed.
his cabin and burned it. Now he says he
will let Blades alone in the future. Crowley
told the whole story of his trouble ia
Contra Costa county, and swears he will
never be taken alive to serve out his .
twenty-five years' sentence.
There is evidently another bandit loose
somewhere in the county. A heavily
armed man appeared at a camp thirty
miles southeast of town last Saturday
night, mounted on a mule, and a>ked for
food. It was given him, and he pretended
he wanted to stay ali night and asked the
route to Tejon Pas?. He left during the '
night, however, and no one saw which ;
way he went. He had two large revolvers '
and a rifle and in all respects answered the
description of the man seen hiding on
Erskine Creek early last week except he '
had a mule instead of a horse.
Parties at the camp believe he was mur
derer Dunham and say te answered his I
newspaper pictures ona descriptions. Be
ing unarmed, they did not molest him.
DELIBERATE SCICINE.
rarest Creek Bachelor Carefully Takes
Bis Oxen Life.
PORTLAND, Or., July 2. â Peter P.
Black, a bachelor, who owned the Man
ville farm and diggings on Forest Creek,
in Jackson County, committed suicide
Tuesday night by shooting himself
through the head with a revolver. He
committed tbe act with great deliberation,
first ascertaining whether the men who
were living with him on the place were in
bed and then making a bed of straw
alongside his cart, which stood in the
yard, and lying down on it before pulling
the trigger of the weapon. Mr. Black was
of c very sensitive temperament and thor
oughly conscientious. Being somewhat
involved, it is believed that brooding over
his debts caused temporary insanity, dur
ing wnicii he took his iife.

SEATTLE, Wash., July 2.â The Daw?on
evidence to-day was all for the defense,
the principal witness being Mrs. Alice
Allmond, Mrs. Dawson'e sister. Shemade

fast woman.
Mrs. Allmona said that for a long time
before Dr. Dawson left his wife he had de
tectives employed to watch her. One day
Mrs. Dawson ?poke to him about it and he
then denied that he had ever authorized
his counsel, General Carr, or any one else
to place detectives on her track.

cative of a sentiment in favor of the nom

and to-day by white metal leaders through-
I out the State from United .States Senator
Dubois of Idano. who is now in Cnicago.
The tone of these messages, many of

SONORA STAGE,
Lone Bandit Secures Some
Very Valuable
Booty.
HE PILLAGES THE MAIL
Passengers Are Not ' Molested
by the Knight of the
Road.
WELLt-FARGO LOST NOTHING.
Officers Pursuing the Fugitve, Who
Is Bliev d to Be an Old
Offinder.
SONORA, Cal., July 2. âFollowing close \
on the heels of the stajre robbery on Funks j
Hill last Saturday, another was perpe- j
trated early this morning. This time it I
occurred within one mile of Crabtrees and
and seven miles this side of Knights
Ferry. A lone man with a pistol forced
the driver, Andy Shine, to halt and throw |
out the express-box and two mail bags. |
Then with the coolness that marks one j
familiar with what he is about, he com
mandad the driver to move on, and with
iiis booty plunged into the mountain fast
nesses and was quickly out of sight.
At 11 p. m. Wedne ? day, when Andy
Shine, whose route lies between Sonora
and Knights Ferry, started on his
trip, he had, besides the Sonora mail
pouch asid express-box, one passenger, Dr.
Pegg, representative of a surgical imple
ment house of Philadelphia. Arriving at
Jamestown, the mail - bag was taken
aboard, as was also that of Chinese Camp,
when later on the stage drew up at that
place. From thereon, nothing other than
what would be ordinarily seen during the
night took piace, until nearing the Crab-
trees stopping place.
It was then breaking day. Suddenly a
masked man sprung from behind a large
rock Dear toe horses' beads, and, with
a cocked pistol leveled at Shine, yelled in
quick, sharp tones, "Hold up, there! drop
that box!" According to this demand the
roDber obtained two "mail bags, the third
Shine managing to secrete from view. The
pouches taken were those from James
town and Chinese Camp.
Having secured all that he thought was
of value th: highwayman ordered the
driver to move on. Shine did not wait for
further instructions, but plying the whip
to his horses covered t c ground rapidly
to Knights Ferry, and there related his
startling experience. The deputy Sheriff
and Constable of Knights Ferry were no
tified, and messages ' hurried to Sheriff
Yancy detailing what had happened.
The officers responded and quickly went
to the scene of the holdup, but what suc
cess attended their efforts to apprehend !
the fugitive has not been learned.
The robber appeared hatless, with a black !
mask over his face, and wore a jumper and j
blue overalls. He was of medium height !
and weighed about 150 pounds. Tue vaiue
of the booty obtained, while not definitely
known, is believed to be in the hundreds.
The maiibag from Jamestown containe I a
registered package valued at several
hundred dollars. Wells, Fargo & Co.'s j
ioss is said to be to the extent of the box
only.
That the outlaw is the same one tnat I
waylaid the stage Saturday night last there
seems to be little doubt. His description
tallies perfectly, and the mask and firearm
used are thought to be identical.
BUSY SCENES VALLEJO
Beginning of the Fiscal Year
Futs Many Men to
Work.
Ta'k of Converting the Old Flagship
Pensacola Into a Training-
School.
VALLEJO, Cal., July 2.â Yesterday be
ing fim of the fiscal year at the navy
yard, quite an additional force of men
were put to work in the department of
steam enjiineeriner, where repairs will be
at once commenced on the Bennington,
Ranker and Thetis. T c Bennington will
be ready for sea on the 15th hist., and there
is a rumor that she will co to China,
though that matter has not been fully de
termined upon.
Word was received to-day from the Sec
retary of the Navy, also from the Chief of
the Bureau of Construction and Repairs,
relative to the time it will take and the
com of putting the old flagship Pensacola
in trim for use as a naval training-ship.
It has been the- intention of tne Secretary
of the Navy for some time to have the
Pensacola fitted for this service, but until
to-day nothing definite has been heard
that would indicate tne intentions of the
department. Just as soon as possible esti
mates will be forwarded to the depart
ment. The ship has had many articles re
moved under the supposition that she was
to be disposed of at auction. Should she
be ordered repaired and fitted for train
ing-ship purposes considerable extra work
at the yard will be caused. The Pensacola
is well adapted for the purpose, being large
and comfortable.
There are many apprentices aboard the
Independence who have been shipped un
'lei the recent law authorizing 100 to be
enlisfd for the service. The quota is not
vet fihed, but it is safe to say that none will
be admitted to this branch of the service
without a good moral character, as Ad
miral Kirkiand recently issued a manda
tory order to the commanding officer of
the receivine-ship that no known jailbirds
or those trying to get into the navy by
keeping out of jail should be enlisted or
shipped under any consideration, and for
this stand Admiral Kirkiand receives the
thanks of all officers ami men in the naval
service on the Pacific Coast.
The Charleston will probably not come
to toe island before Monday of next
week.
The Secretary of the Navy has given
Permission to those in the service on ships
find at the navy-yard who desire to come
to Valiejo on the Fourth of July and
participate in the parade and festivities.
About 100 will avail themselves of the
opportunity.

SAN BERNARDINO SUIT.
Writ of Injunction Granted in the
Matter of the Chino Ranch
Property.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., July 2.â
To-day an action was commenced by Rich
ard Gird againbt C. H. Phillips "of the
Chino Ranch Company and Lovell White
and Thomas Eatoa Walker as trustees.
The complaint prays for a writ of injunc
tion and asks for the appointment of a re
ceiver, for an accounting and the sur
render of the original property, re
straining the ranch company from collect
ing rents until such time as the court can
determine the rights of the property and
for money advanced to pay interest on the
indebtedness.
The complaint recites that a contract
was entered into between Gird and Phil
lips on September 29, 1894. The original
contract was for the sale of Chino ranch
property, subject to a mortgage of $525,000
due the San Francisco Savings Union.
The purchase price was $1,600,000, and
the complaint charges that Phillips has
neglected to pay the interest to the San
Francisco Savings Union or the payments,
yet he has colJected rent amounting to
$150,000 and received from the sale of land
$250,000 in notes and other collateral.
He is alleged to have hypothecated a
large amount of these securities and mis
appropriated the money received. The
complaint alleges that Phillips and the
Chino Ranch Company are insolvent, and
a writ of inanition was granted by Judge
J. L. Campbell.
The court has named S. F. Zombro of
this city as receiver, and Ue will take im
mediate possession of the property and
conduct its business.
This movement will in nowise affect the
deal now pending with the English syndi
cate for the purchase of the ranch, but the
steD is simply taken to protect the prop
erty and the right of all the parties in in- '
terest.
LOS ANGELES COLLAPSE,
Captain Spilman's Famous Sub
urban Water-Bubble
Has Burst.
Promoters of the Scheme Arrested on
a Criminal Charge Preferred
by a Victim.
LOS ANGELES, Cat,., July 2.â Captain
Spilman's famous suburban water devel
opment scheme seems in a fair way to be
eternally exploded. It has been known in
certain circles for some time that the
affairs of the Spilman Water Company
were in arvtning but a satisfactory condi
tion, despite reports that an English syn
dicate was just about ready to pay an
enormous sum of money for the paper
plans and an open lease. The captain, on
his own part, has been rustling to raise
the wind and save the enterprise, but a
criminal action instituted to-day by J. T.
Nichols against W. T. Spilman and his
associates, Dr. Green and J. K. Warren,
seems to warrant the prediction that the
jig is up. Sp Iman, who posed as "presi
dent" on paper, was arrested, but man
aged to give bonds, and his examination is
set for the 9tn inst. Green and Warren
have found further operations in Los
Angeles undesirable, and are therefore
absent.
Complainant Nichols alleges misrepre
sentation and fraud on the part of de
fendants in niching from him $1500 in
coin of the realm for the "stock." Nichols
was told that the Spilman Suburban Water
Company had on deposit in the Los An
geles National Bank $70,000, which would
be used to complete the work. After
much talk, from which the affiant gathered
that the Spilman stock was of the par
value of $100 and had a ready market at 75
cents on the dollar, he was induced to
invest
CHINESE LOTTERIES.
In Full Blast With the Knowledge of the
Authorities.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 2.â A local
newspaper surprised this community re
cently by quoting District Attorney Don
nell, who said that a responsible citizen
had told him that Chinese lotteries were
running in this city with the knowledge of
the Police Department. The citizen was
so confident of his information that he
offered to point out every place where a
lottery was conducted. Donnell, seeing a
burly policeman passing, inquired about
the astonishing statement of his friend.
The copper answered that he had a
prisoner to look after just then, and fur
ther said that he had no orders to raid the
place, and would not do so without orders.
To-night v local paper gives a detailed
account of how an impecunious sport had
pawned his razor for 60 cents, and with
the proceeds piayed Chinese lottery with
great success.
The carrying on of these eames forms
one item on tl\e long list of municipal
misrule agitating *he minds of many
prominent citizens, who are planning to
organize a reform movement in order to
clean out the Augean stables.
Death of Two Old Soldiers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 2.â Coroner

overdose of laudanum with suicidal intent.
The deceased was a native of Germany,
aged 59 years.
Another old soldier named Jatnes But
ler died suddenly at The Palms, near the
home, early this morning. The remains
were brought here and an inquest held
this afternoon.

While Judge Barnes was denouncing

"Do you know John P. Irish out in Cali
fornia?" inquired an lowa delegate of me
to-day.
I confessed to an acquaintanceship with
that cravatless statesman, orator and
naval officer, and he then repeated an
amusing incident in the career of the Cali
fornian.
"It was in the early days," he said,
"when Colonel Irish was a young man.
He was a resident of lowa. We all liked
him for his genial ways and many talents.
One of his chief gifts, you know, is his
! capacity to tell a story, and this one he re
lates of himself. It seems that he had
been invited over to canvass the district
of a friend who was running for Congress
from Indiana. Even in his younger days
he was a splendid orator and" his speeches
attracted much attention. He made
many converts to the cause of Democracy,
and the result was that his friend was
elected by an overwhelming majority.
When John returned home to lowa his
friends turned out and gave him an ova
tion. He was escorted through the streets
with a brass band and torchlight proces
sion. Naturally he was delighted witu his
reception, and it inspired him to do even
better work for his party. Two years
later, when his Indiana friend was run
ning for Congress, he canvassed the dis
trict, but instead of victory there came
defeat, and John returned home with a
heavy heart. There was no crowd at the
depot to welcome him, no fireworks and
no bras? band. The train slowed just be
fore it got into town and let him off and
he walked home through an alley and
went into retirement."
The hotel corridors are swarming with
excited people, and all trains arriving
here to-night bring hundreds of additional
delegates and visitors to swell the multi
tude. Men distinguished for party ser
j vice and others no less conspicuous in
I various walks of public life are here in
j lame numbers.
John R. McLean, who will be named by
Ohio for the Presidential nomination, was
a conspicuous figure in the rotunda of the

Kentucky. Both are looked upon as Vice-
President possibilities, as they are not
considered sufficiently strong to secure

Johnson and Henry George, of New York,

APIA, Samoa, June 17.â The same un

LAURIER TO BE KNIGHTED
The Canadian Liberal Leader to
Be Honored by England's
Queen.
Reciprocity May Be Established Be
tween the United States and
Its Neighbor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 2.-That
the Hon. Wilfred Laurier, the leader of the
Liberal forces, whose party gained a
sweeping victory at the elections in Canada
last week, will be knighted by the Queen,
as foreshadowed in the dispatches from
Ottawa this morning, is not doubted here
in diplomatic circles.
There is some speculation here as to the
extent to which the Liberal party in Can
ada will go in a revision of their tariff
duties so far as their trade with the Uni ted j
States is concerned.
U has been suggested that the Liberals
will endeavor to effect a reciprocity treaty
with the United States similar in its cus
toms provisions to that of 1854. That
treaty was abrogated twelve years later at
the. request of the United States. It was
argued that it provided no market for our
manufactured goods, but related wholly to
a reciprocal exchange of raw materials
principally those belonging to the agri
cultural schedules.
It is :iot believed for this reason that
such treaty would be acceptable to the
United States, particularly, as Americans
living along the northern borders are
already dissatisfied with that feature of
the present tariff law which admits Ca
nadian farm products free of duty into
this country.
It is stated, on the other hand, that Ca
nadians who favor enlarged trade with the
United States will object to a revision of
their tariff laws which would make a
palpable discrimination against the
mother country in favor of the United
States.
A reciprocity treaty would be another
j matter. Sach a treaty would not be en-
I tirely satisfactory to Gr9at Britain, but no
objection would be made by the London
Government so lont* as the Canadians
themselves desired it. Such steps as the
Canadian Liberals may take in tnis direc
tion will be delayed until after the 4th of
next March.

EMILE HESTRES IS FOUND
The Old Frenchman Discovered
to Be Dying in the
Almshouse.
He Strayed for Two Days and Was
Finally Picked Up by n
Policeman.
Emile Hestres, the Frenchman who
strayed away from his lodging, 609 Pine
street, June 7, has been found to be in
the Almshouse in a dying condition.
The old centleman went out into the
Mission on the 7th inst. to visit a lady
friend. He did not return home at night and
inquiries on the part of old friends did
not succeed in revealing his whereabouts.
Yesterday Alfred Chaigneau, proprietor of
the Franco-Calif or nien, went to the Alms
house, having heard through an inmate
that the old gentleman was there.
He found Emile Hestres in the in
firmary known as the Last Chance In such
an enfeebled state of mind and body that
it is douDtful whether he was able to
recognize his friend.
"He must have had some mental aberra
tion the day that fee went out into the
Mission," j-aid Mr. Chaigneau, "and in
stead of returning home he strayed away.
Probabl y he wandered about for two days,
though no one can say for certain wkat
happened to him during that time. On
the 9th of June he was picked up in an en
feebled condition by a policeman, and as
he could not give any clear account of
himself, wÂ«S taken to the Almshouse,
where he has been ever since. He was
abie to go on repealing '609 Pine street,'
out they do not seem to have known what
he meant."
Several members of the French colony
who knew the old gentleman in better
days, having learned yesterday that be
was in the Almshouse, communicated
with that institution to see if anything
could be done for Euale He.-tres. He has
been a member of the French Bem.voient
Society for over forty years and therefore
has a right to enter the French Hospital.
Next week he will be taken there if it is
considered that doing so will better hi 3
condition.
"He seems to be receiving every possible
attention at the Almshou>e,'' said. Mr.
Chaigneau, "and even if he could stand
being moved, it is doubtful whether he
would be better off in the hospital.
From all accounts he is very feeble. The
old gentleman no longer seems to have
any memory. As an invalid, he has a per
fect right to go to the French Hospital
but if his mind goes entirely :ind hisnodily
health returns he could not remain there."
It will probably be decided to-day
whether Emile Hestres goes to the hospital
or reniaiua at the Almahouse. From all
accounts, he has only a short time to live,
and it is feared that moving him would
hasten his end.

THOUGH CLUBBED
BE FOUGHT BACK,
An Old Artilleryman Stood
Up by a Masked
Robber.
HE SOUNDED AN" ALARM.
The Guard Was Called Out, but
the Highwayman Made
His Escape.
MASK AND PISTOL SECURED
Alphons Zehnder. the Watchman, Had
a Very Narrow Escape for
His Life.
The army post at the Presidio was in a
state of general excitement last Wednes
day nieht. A burglar attempted to break
into the watchman's house in the National
Cemetery, and the guardian being an old
army man at once showed fight. The
burglar pulled a gun, but instead of firing,
he used it as a club. The watchman was
badly cut up with the butt of the weapo n
but he finally aroused the guard and when
they came along on the double-quick the
burglar broke and ran, leaving his pistol
and cap behind him.
When the attempted hold-up was made
Captain McLellan was on duty, and he
makes the following concise report of the
disturbance:
"On the night of July 1, about 12 o'clock,
a man went to the" cabin occupied by
Alphons Zehnder, who is employed at
the National Cemetery at the Presidio,
and called him out, saying that the super
intendent of the cemetery wanted to see
him.
"Zehnder responded, and when he came
out the unknown m3n presented a pistol
and ordered him to hoid up his hands.
Zehnder was not that sort, and, instead of
j holding up his hands, he sailed into the
burglar, and called out lustily for help.
"The robber hit Zehnder on the head
with his pistol several times and cut
his face badly, but. the watchman fought
him off and finally got possession of his
pistol. The sergeant and another man of
the cemetery guard coming up the robber
broke away from Zehnder and disappeared
in the woods surrounding the place, and
could not be found though searched for
by a detachment from the main guard
also.
"The robber left his hat and pistol. He
wore a mask over his face, and cannot be
identified by Zehnder.
"Just what the man was after cannot be
ascertained. Zelinder is an old man and
was formerly a member of the Light Ar
tillery. He has saved considerable money,
I and the supposition has always been that
since the savings bank scare he has kept
his savings somewhere in the cemetery.
When told that burglarÃ were abroad he
has always langhed and said it would take
an adept to secure his wealth."
The adept has evidently made the at
tempt and failed, but it is doubtful
whether or not Zehnder would not be
better off if he had lost tlie money. His
face is badly cut and his body is one mass
of bruises. He has a pistol and a mass to
show that he was in the fight, but then
he is lying in the hospital at the Presidio
and no one knows when he will be out and
about again. In the meantime the police
have been put on the trial and they are
now busily at work hunting for a clew.
At a late hour last nieht Captain Rob
erts, the officer of the day at the Presidio,
and one of the chief of detectives' men
were out inspecting the ground. Zehnder
was interviewed in the hospital, but he
had no clew to give, save that the man
was desperate and a bold fighter. Had the
old man held up his hands when ordered
the robber would have had all the chances
he wanted. He could have bound and
gagged Zehnder and then gone about his
work in a methodical manner. The old
man fought back, however, and raised the
guard.
As soon as the soldiers appeared the
robber broke away, and, leaving his pistol
and mask behind him, made his escape.
In the meantime army officials are much

CARDS FROM A LAWYER.
Means Used by a Noe Attorney
to Notify Mission Prop
erty-Owners.
Pustals With Purported Warnings
Sent to Members of the De
fense Union.
Mission residents are laughing at the
latest scheme of an attorney of the Noe
heirs to gain the attention of property
owners in that vicinity. The very latest
dodge is the sending of postal cards bear
ing the following alleged warning to prop
erty-owners belonging to the defense
unions organized to fight the Noe claims:
San Francisco, Cal., June 30, 1896.
Noe et al., plaintiffs, vs. Adams et al., de
fendants.
You are hereby notified that you are In de
fault in the above entitled action and judgÂ»
ment will be entered agninst you accordingly.
This notice is sent you that you cannot come
into court and ask that default be set aside on
the ground of excusable neglect. Respectfully,
P. L. Koscialowski , Attorney of Plaintiffs.
The cards, although all hand -written,
are identical in language. Probably the
writer thought that a person receiving a
postal in individual handwriting would
attach more significance to it than to a
typewritten or printed notice.
"This latest scheme," deciarsd Attorney
Van Dnzer of the Mission Defense Union
last evening, "is practically an endeavor
| to intimidate property-owners into buying
quitciaim deeds, :;lthou!rh the writers
were cunning enough not to word the no
tices as demands for money, but as warn
ings.
"The law provides that in case a default
is taken in a .suit it may be set aside
within six months on the ground of ex
cusable neglect, and Koscialowski claims
he is doing this to prevent such a plea
being made. But the fact that the postals
are being sent to those who have been an
swered for by the Defense Union shows
thai the real purpose is to make the mem
bers of the union believe that their cases
have been neglected and to persuade them
to buy deeds.
"Of course, even if they persuaded only
two or three to buy deeds it would be a
money- making scneme for them. One
thousand postals would only cost them
$10, and even if they got two to buy deeds
at $5 apiece they would lose nothinc.
And, of course, the more they get to buy
deeds the more they can scare the otier
property-owners. The scheme, however,
does not work, for the property-owners all
see through it."
Franklin K. Lane, the attorney for the
members of the San Miguel Defense Union,
was indignant that such conduct on the
part of Attorney Koscialowski should be
tolerate<.l by the members of the San Fran
cisco bar.
"If this fellow Koscialowski doesn't stop
sending out such postals, our Defense As
sociation will have to see what the Bar As
sociation may have to say as to such 'pro
fessional' conduct.
"The first of these caseshas been tried
and submitted, and we expect a decision
as soon as Judge Sanderson returns from
his vacation. These people know they
will be beaten; they acknowledged so.
But before that decision is handed down
they want to scare a few more soft-heads
into paying them for quitclaim iteeds. I
hope nobody will be alarmed by this new
trick."
A Holiday Matinee.
A holiday matinee of Sydney Grundy's ptfty,
"A Bunch of Violets," will be given by L. R.

and PROSPERITY.
FOR PBESIDEM-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Obio
FOR VICK-rRKSIDEM-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
BLacnon notkxbeb a. isrÂ»^.
The voice of business is for protection.
Chicago expects a circus, but she may
see a hara-kari.
Leave no straw around your premises to
show where the firecracker fell.
See the Glorious Fourtn in Pan Francisco
and take in Monterey next week.
From the fact that Altgeld is bossing the
job we may be sure it will be a bad one.
The silver bolt at St. Louis may be more
than matched by a gold bolt at Chicago.
The only way lor Democrats to escape
the tariff issue is to pet out of the country.
Ask the dairymen and the lumbermen
what they think of free trade and Democ
racy.
It will be silver monometallism at Chi
cago. Democracy always overdoes the
thing.
The people have learned now that what
is called free trade is simply the stagna
tion of trade.
The California delegation to Chicago is
not solid for free silver. Boss Daggett put
a joker in it.
The nearer Democracy comes to anarchy
the better Boss Alteeld will like it. That
is what he favors.
Altgeldism is only Clevelandism re
versed. They are th* two sides of the
same abomination.
There are a good many wool men who
call themselves Democrats, but they are
not free-traders any more.
Cleveland once wished a renomination,
but he would now be glad to compromise
on a complimentary mention.
The Chicago convention is expected to
be a long one, but it may close with a
slam before it is three days old.
By way of idle cariosity the peopls
would like to know why all these Federal
officials are hastening to Chicago.
When Altgeld gets through with them
the Democrats will probably be willing to
accept Buckley as a National leader.
The careless firecracker will be very apt
to drop into the yard that nasn't been
cleaned up, and then it will make a clean
6 weep.
The cruel remarks of Chicago about St.
Louis convention weather will now be re
turned from the latter city at Chicago's
expense.
New York would not mind the loss of
her prestige with Democracy so much
were it not for the fact that Chicago has
lound it.
This is the time to remember that a
little carefulness in guarding aeainst fires
is better than a great deal of work in put
ting them out.
Having done their worst to ruin the in
dustries of the country, Democracy can
ccc no issue before it rxcfpt to whirl in
and try to ruin the bat>k< r->.
It will avail the country nothing to re
establish bimetallism until we have re
vived our industries and put into circula
tion the idle money of the land.
It was all very well for Cleveland to
urge the Democratic gold men to fight to
the end, but to those who are in the fight
it seems that the end has come.
After he leaves the White House Cleve
land may go to England and eet an honor
ary degree all the same as Bayard, for he
certainly deserves one just as well.
There are plenty of cold Democrats,
silver Democrats and bimetallic Demo
crats everywhere, but there are no longer
any free-trade Democrats in any part of
the country.
With the Democratic convention fairly
under the control of Altgeld and bis
Chicago anarchists it is only the accident
of birth that keeps Herr Most from getting
the Presidential nomination on the first
ballot.
It is the aim of the Republican party to
provide every American workingman with
a chance to have a comfortable home and
to give him steady work and good wages
to maintain it. It is for that reason the
people support it.
Harry- E. Wise, one ot the California
delegates to the Chicago convention, is
quoted as saying: "I want to see a tariff
on all raw and manufactured wool. I was
for free wool for xuapy years, but 1 have
got sick of it." There are many more
Democrats in the same fix. In fact the
whole party is sick.
THE COST OF IT.
The exhibit of the operations of the
National treasury for the three fiscal years
of the Cleveland administration show ex
penditures to have been $137,000,000 in ex
cess of income. In addition to that large
sum, there must be added $262,000,000 of
Government bonds that have been sold to
maintain the gold reserve. The revenue
deficit for the first month of the fourth
year, July, is estimated at $10,000,000, but
it will not average more than one-third of
that sum per month during the coming
year. Probably the deficit for the whole
four years of the present administration
will reach $175,000,000, which the people
can make up their minds to pay as ttie
price of the operation of the Wilson-
Gorman tariff law. In addition to the
enormous deficit, there must be added
Government bonds and interest thereon
issued already, aggregating about $500,
-000,000. This is on the supposition that
no more bonds will be issued, but the way
the treasury gold is shrinking, another is
sue of at least $100,000,000 will have to be
made.
That would make the total bond issue,
including interest, fully $700,000,000, which,
when added to $175,000,000 representing
the deficit in the income account, will give
the people a pretty correct iaea of what
the Cleveland administration has cost
them directly. Indirectly the cost has
been enormous, but there is no way of
even approximating the amounts. If one
could figure up the losses to trade, com
merce and industry that the panic which
came upon the country soon after Cleve
land was inaugurated forced the people
to bear, the sum total of the cost of elect
ing a Democratic President in 1892 could
be ascertained, but it cannot be done; be
sides, money would not compensate for
the hunger and other kinds of distress
which tens of thousands of the people have
been aillicted with during the last three
years.
No one supposes that Cleveland or any
member of his oihcial family has enriched
himself to the extent of a farthing during
all these years of trial and trouble. The
difficulty has been gross incapacity. The
substitution of the Wilson-Gorman tariff
law for tbe McKinley act was a blunder
that will cost the country by the time it
can be repealed nearly $1, 000, 000, 000. That
is to say, th<Â» Government will be in debt
$1,000,000,000 more when Mr. Cleveland
vacates the White House than when he
moved in. The people thought they would
give the Democracy a fair trial, and they
did ; but the bill of cost for the experiment
is yet to be paid, nor 13 there any way of
avoiding the payment of it. In view of
the fact that all this trouble has come
upon the country as the result of a tariff
monstrosity, which is still playing havoc
in all lines of business, it would seem that
the reasonable thing to do would be its
repeal at the earliest moment possible. It
would seem, indeed, that every business
man and wageruan in the country should
ignore all other public issues until that
heavy weight had been removed. It needs
no argument to prove that had the tariff
act of IS9O been left as it was there would
have been no occasion tor issuing bonds,
nor would a revenue deficit have been
possible. The reports of ti>e income ac
count of the Government while the Mc-
Kinley law was iv force show that the
people's financial troubles have come as
the direct consequence of the present
tariff law.
A GOOD THING FOR CALIFORNIA.
It would have been impossible four years
! ago to tind a protection Democrat in Cali
| forniu, but the "woods are full" of them
: this year. At least one of the delegates now
! en route to the Chicago convention will
insist that the piatform declare for better
| protection to the industrial and agricult
j ural interests of the Pacific Coast. That
! one left here firmly of the opinion that the
! money question was of minor importance
I as compared with a little higher fence
around the iron, sheep, fruit, wine,
i tobacco, jrlass, grain and other business
! enterprises of California. In this connec
ticyi it may be saia that the s-ame feeling
prevails to a considerable extent in Pacific
Coast Democratic circles.
Delegate Wise voiced the sentiments of
all California Democrat wool-growers
{ when he told The Call "I want to see a
I tariff on all raw and manufactured wool."
He said he was for free wool â  while ago,
but he finds that it won't work in business.
Mr. Denigan, who is the head of a large
San Francisco wool house, is also a repre
sentative business man of the Democratic
persuasion in California, and what he says
may be relied upon as correctly reflecting
the opinion of all Democrats who are en
gaged in business pursuits that need to be
protected against unjust and unreasonable
outside competition. To be sure they
still talk of a "revenue tariff," but not the
kind Wilson and Gorman inHicted upon
the country, and meanwhile they want a
tariff that will protect tneir own revenue.
The striking thing, and the thing to be
observed in the declarations of leading
Democrats on the tariff question, is that
business men of all parties in California
are getting closer together on the tariff
question. Their experience in the last
three years in the worKl of commerce has
demonstrated to them the fact that Cali
fornia must have ample protection to her
industries if she is to prosper. It in not
sentiment nor politics with the business
men hereabouts. Ii is business operations
for Drofits, and since protection is neces
sary to profits, why. as sensible business
men, they want, protection. Party lines*
are being obliterated so far as that Ques
tion is concerned, and it is not now so
much a question of party as it is a ques
tion of to whom shall California turn for
succor.
It is not at all likely, however, that the
Chicago convention will listen a moment
to the California delegation on a proposi
tion for something comforting and
strengthening to tiieir business enterprises.
Altgeld holds the wuip, and he is an ultra
free-trader; besides, he intends that the
silver question shall dominate all others,
and thf t if his candidate is elected, the
present tariff schedule will be attended to
on the basis of not less than 50 per cent
reduction â after the mints are running full
time on 1Â« to 1 silver dollars, all of which
will be good for the party of protection
and prosperity in California.
THE TWO-THIRDS RULE.
From the present outlook it seems prob
able that the great fight in the Chicago
convention will take place over a motion
to abolish the rule which requires a two
thirds vote to nominate a candidate for
the Presidency. The silver men. having a
strong majority, can organize the conven
tion and frame the platform, but lacking
a two-thirds vote cannot nominate a can
didate under the rule without compromis
ing with the gold men. The issue is. Will
they make the compromise or abolish the
rule?
The establishment of the two-thirds rn!e
in Democratic conventions dates as far
back as 1532. At that time there was no
contest in the convention, the delegates
being virtually unanimous for the nomi
nation of Jackson, and the rule was
adopted simply as a precautionary meas
ure to prevent the party from nominating
TIIESANFR^CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 3, 1896.
at any time a candidate who had only sec
tional support. The object was to insure
the selection of a candidate who would be
fairly acceptable to Democrats of all sec
tions of the Union, and iU adoption was
made without notable opposition from any
quarter.
Only twice in our history has the rule
seriously affected the proceedings of Dem
ocratic conventions. Once in 1844, when
Van Buren, who had an easy majority in
the convention, drawn mainly from the
Northern States, was defeated by the
Southern men and a compromise effected
by the nomination of James K. Polk. The
other was the famous instance of 1860,
when compromise being impossible the
convention at Charleston failed to make a
nomination and the party divided and put
two tickets in the lield; the Northern or
majority winjr beiug headed by Douglas
and the Southern minority by Breckin
ridge.
In both of these instances the Demo
crats from the Northern States dad a ma
jority in the convention and might have
repealed the two-thirds rule but forbore to
do so. In the Chicago convention the con
ditions will be reversed. The South and
West will have the majority and the
North -Eastern States will have to invoke
the rule for their protection. It remains
to be seen whether the followers of Till
ruan and Altgeld will be as loyal to Dem
ocratic precedents and rules as were those
of Van liuien and Douglas, or whether
they will virtually destroy the party by
destroying the continuity of its principles
and practices.
It is by no means sure that the rule
can be overthrown, even if the extreme
silver men attempt it. The Democratic
mind is naturally conservative, and not a
few silver men will refuse to vote for the
abolition of a rule that has so lone borne
the test of time. To repeal it will seem
to many Democrats a virtual dissolution
of the party. It would pive the minority
a good excuse for declaring the nomina
tion irregular and undemocratic, and
would almost certainly result in an f**nt
crn Democratic ticket running in opposi
tion to that from the West and the Souch.
MAKE THEM THE OFFICIAL BATES
The presumption is that freight rates
were too high to permit a laree movement
of traffic before the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Kailway reduced them,
and it is reasonable to assume, too, that
they were not reduced to where the rail
way would sustain a loss. A railway is a
business enterprise for the one purpose of
making money for its owners. Kates are
always made so that the traffic will yield
ample revenue to provide for all expendi
ture and leave a margin of profit. It fol
lows, then, that when a railway volun
tarily lowers its charges it admits that
they were unjustly high and that reduc
ing them does not mean a loss to the car
rier. A railway is in no sense a charitable
institution. On the contrary, it is as soul
less as a boulder in the mountain, and it
does nothing that does not promise ade
quate compensation. Moreover, when a
railway reduces its schedule of charges for
its services it does so because, fiist, they
are higher than tne traffic can bear, and,
second, becauso by reducing them traffic
can afford to move, which in turn increases
the volume of the carried tonnage. Do not
think for a moment that a railway ever
voluntarily establishes a rate-sheet that
provides for less revenue than is required
for the expenditure and profit account.
In announcing ji horizontaicut in traffic
tariffs the Valley road proves without tne
asking that the charges that are permitted
by the Kailway Commission are too high.
No other evidence of that fact is needed.
Thi road admits by iis own free act that
there is a reasonable protit in carrying
tonnage at its reduced charges. That is
all the Commissioners need to warrant
them in making the Valley road's new
schedule the official maximum raie sheet,
not only in the territory covered by that
particular road, but for every mile of rail
way in the State. The Southern Pacific
has met the Valley line's cut, but nnder
protest. The protest, however, is an ex
pression of the road's inordinate greed, as
is fhown in its action in the premises.
The Sontbsrn Pacific was not obliged to
meet the Valley road's cut. It had a per
fect right to hold tast to the charges estab
lished by the Commissioners. But in
meeting the reduction the Southern
Pacific either proves that the old rates
were too high and that tne new rates are
profitable, or that the management of the
road is false to its employer. The man
agement has no more right to entail
losses upon the owners of the property by
reducing rates below the cost of service
than it has to entail losses by burning
station-housps or wrecking trains. Hence,
if the Southern Pacific's owners are losing
money by the management cutting rates
below what the law permits it should be
arrested for malicious destruction of a
trust. On the other hand, if the cut rates
are reasonable they should be made the
official maximum rate for the whole
State.
A COINCIDENCE.
It might be considered a curious coinci
dence that Hannis Taylor of Alabama
should be Minister to Spain and Fitzhugh
Lee Consul-General to Cuba at this particu
lar time. Both Taylor and Lee were raised
in an atmosphere that was always burden
ed with the idea that if not annexed, Cuba
should at least be freed from Spanish au
thority. Alabama has been conspicuous
on many occasions for her zeal for Cuban
independence, and no doubt Mr. Taylor
imbibed plenty of it in hisyouns days, and
the same holds good of General Lee. There
never was an effort made by Cubans for
independence that the South was not ready
to extend a helping hand.
But there is another reason why these
representatives of the United States to
Spain and Cuoa should feel very kindly
toward Cubaâ that Is, if it is assumed that
human nature runs right along in the
same old rut and that gratitude continues.
During the war of the rebellion the Cu
bans were very friendly to the South.
Confederate blockade- runners always
found hospitable harbors in Cuban waters,
and a great many Southern families found
pleasant homes in Havana while the war
was raging at home. Of course Cuban
friendship and hospitality -was not alto
gether without protit to the islanders, for
they made a great deal of money shipping
army supplies into and cotton out of the
Confederacy, and on the whole a kindly
feeling prevailed, between the better class
especially, for slavery was a strong bond
of union in those days.
It is not at all likely that either Taylor
or Lee would color facts or too onenlv ex
press their sympathy with the cause of the
Cubans, but on general principles they
may be relied upon to not omit any In
formation in tneir reports to this Govern
ment tiiat would be calculated to at least
set the revolutionists in the true light of
their purpose. It is not at all unfortunate
for Cuba that Taylor is in Madrid and Lee
in Havana.
No sooner did the delegates to the Chi
cago convention find themselves together
on the train than they began to tight over
the question of instructions. It U ever
thus with Democrats,

The strange-looking creature is about tne
size of a small domestic fowl, and is covered
with what is apparently a hairy coat of mot
tled brown. This apteryx probably has the
honor of being the first one of its kind that
has ever breathed the air of America, though
live kiwis have been obtained for botanical
and zoological gardens in Europe.
If there sver was any foundation in fact for
the notorious tiUeyloo bird, the kiwi must
have furnished the suggestion.
It is most active only at night, and then it
goes about rapidly thrusting its long slender
bill into the earth in search of worms on
Apteryx, or Kiwi, the Wingless Nocturnal Bird Found Only in New Zealand.
which it feeds. While thus hunting it keeps
up a continuous audible sniffing, its nostrils
being located very near the end of the upper
inandiblc. The kiwi, for by this name it is
best known iv New Zealand, is sluggish in the
day time and seems to have great difficulty in
seeing. At night it often catches the large
luminous fire worms, crushes them against
the ground and swallows them. Durlug the
operation phospherescent particles adhere to
the beak, and the hermit-like bird can be seen
in the darkness continuing its search for food.
A remarkable thing about the kiwi in addi
tion to the absence of wings and regular
feathers is the grÂ«at size of the egg it lays.
The kiwi egg weighs over 12 ounces, or a
quarter of the bulk of the bird itself.
This ki we Mr. Harrow long ago accustomed
to a meat diet, and that is the reason he has
srotit here alive. He hoped to dispose of it
for $25 to the I'ark Commissioners, but was
told that they would willingly accept it for
nothing.
Mr. Harrow lived in South Africa for sixteen
years before he went to New Zealand. He says
he was one of the first to go to the South Af
rica diamond fields from England, to which
country he is now going on a visit to old
scenes.
Gold mining and the digging of kauri gum,
used in tha manufacture of varnish, are the
principal industries about Auckland. The
kauri gum is found in the earth in resinous
lumps, located by tapping with pointed iron
rods. It is one of the principal exports to
America and elsewhere.
Four miles from Auckland, which i~ a city of
about 50,000, is Lake Takapuna, a fresh water
lake only 200 yards from tin- sea, a condition
that does not maintain anywhere else in the
world. The waters of the lake, now used for
North Shore, are soon to become the main sup
ply for the city ol Auckland.
"The class of '96 at the Annapolis Naval
Academy was Doted for Its social functions,"
said Ensign Wurtsbough yesterday as he sat on
the edge of the bureau in his room at the Oc
cidental.
"We were the deuce for the society part, but
not much lor ' savoir,' " remarked Ensign
Tozer from his position on the foot of the bed.
â¢â¢Everybody said." continued Wurtsbough,
"that '96 was Just such a class for good times
as was the class of '69, and that was always
held up to us as a model in its way.
"There was one fellow." interposed Ensign
Lincoln, and then he pause! and hurriedly
scanned the faces of those grouped about him,
"who was the equal of your Lucky Baldwin
for winning the fair sex. He's downstairs
now with one of the other fellows checking
our baggage, for we arc off for Santa Cruz on
the next train to join tne FhiUdclptiia.
"Well, 'the major' was the spooniest fellow in
the clmss. He took the lead as a ladles' man
from the first, before the rest of us had got
over feeling mean because of the soap the
upper clansmen made us eat and the ink they
compelled us to drink when we entered the
academy in the summer of '02.
'At Annapolis there is a place called 'the
mortar.' It's just a big mortar surrounded by
a number of old cannon, but it's a regular
lovers' retreat. All the spooney couples make
that a stamping ground.
"One night there was a big party on, and
some of the lower classmeu went 'rubber-neck
ing' round the mortar, and they heard
Donbled-barrelled Jr.V voice saying tenderly, i
'Ob, don't call me Mr. Call me Arthur." His
name is a double-ended affair, and lhai'.s why
'the major' hss another nickname.
"But that wasn't a marker to the light inci-i
dent," put In another ensign who had only a j
short time before been discussing Sharkey and
what work on the Philadelphia had done for
him in a pugilistic way. "One night there
was a cruiser in the harbor. It was a deuce of
a dark night, but -the major' was on duty at
'the mortar.' All of a sudden the cruiser :
flashed her powerful search light right on 'the
mortar.' The officer knew from experience In
his own academy days what it might strike.
There were two heads on one pair of shoulders.
Some fellow spoiled what might after all have
been a match by letting out a hoarse laugh
and giving our presence dead awxr."
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
WHEAT AND SILVER.
The Decline tx the PmcHAStso Power op
Pkzciocr Metals.
To the Editor of the Call: In reply to an article
written to your influential journal in relation
to wheat and silver a correspondent named
Nelson saw fit to reply thereto alleging that
an ounce of silver bullion now will and ever
would exchange for a bushel of wheatâ that
the two rise and fall together. The article of
mine contained the argument that the price of
wheat is and will be at all times in the future
as long as we export a surplus of wheat fixed
in the Liverpool market and, therefore, will be
fixed in the single grnld standard. That, there
fore, it is the interest of the wheat-grower to
insist on the single gold standard hereâ ?o
buy, as he sells, in a single gold standard
market.
It was further contended that the fluctua
tions in silver during the transit of the wheat
to Liverpool would constrain the Liverpool
buyer to pay less than be would pay on a single
gold basis of payments here. It was contended
that the free, independent and unlimited
coinage of silver would produce silver mono
metallism here. That, therefore, to the extent
of the prospective fluctuation the wheat
grower here would gel less for Ms wheat.
Wheat and silver nave no relation in value to
each other. They each depend on their own
market. They each depend on the cost of pro
duction as corrected by the supply and de
mand.
The two commodities have never correspond- i
ed in value; silver baa for hundreds of yean
tended to exchange for less wheat. Wayland
in his "Political Economy" of 18-41 writes the
following: -'The quantity of wheat in France!
which was exchanged in 1520 fr>r 512 grains i
of silver was exchanged in 1536 for 10W3 i
grains, in 1002 for 2(X>jsWraitis and iv 1789 for
2012 grains." He turfVir prophetically says:
"Now, as the progress of geology, mining and I
mineralogy will probably Â«reatly Increase the I
production of tne precious metals in the
luture it is probable that the Drices will con
tinue to tali.''
Before 1873 the price of silver bullion per
ounce w as from 4 to t> per cent from $ 1 29 per
ounce, yet the price of wheat per bushel in
Boston was as follows: In 1798, 60 cent*, ex
changing for less than half an ounce of silver
bullion; in 1803 wheat was 70 cents per
bushel, in 1819 wheat was 80 cent*, in 1820 it
was 60 cents, in 1821 wheat was 43 cents per
bushel, in 1624 wheat was 48 cents per busnel,
in 1825 it was 53 cents, in 1828 It wus 99
cents, in 1834 it was 66 cents (see McCul
louKh's Commercial Dictionary, article Prices).
To-day a bushel of wheat will exchange for
practically an ounce of silver builion, showing
that Wayland correctly taw the future, and
that silver has continued to fall as against
wheat.
Now it is proposed to resist the natural
forces and to artificially force silver to ex
change for more wheat â in other words, to
allow a public law to be enacted to have us
hire the silver mining multi-millionaire cor
porations to conduct thvir own business for
their own profit at the public expense, and
especially at the cost of the wheat-producers.
It. therefore, clearly appears that silver and
wheat iollow their own markets and have no
relation to one another. In relation to silver
monometallism, it may be briefly asserted that
if the mint price of gold bullion is fixed at only
16 ounces of silver bullion for 1 ounce of gold,
that the owner of the bullion will not send his
gold bullion to the mint, but will send it to
the metal merchants of his own country, who
will send it away where the laws of nature
prevail, and where they will give nearly twice
as much silver as the mint does. This is the
reason why holders ot gold bullion Bell none
to the Mexican mint, but sell it to the mer
chants who overbid the mint, and why Mexico
has silver monometallism, .Respectfully,
John Heenan.

A LARGE APRON OR ROBE.
A full apron that will cover the entire dress,
and with large sleeves that fit comfortably
over dress sleeves, is a garment indispensable
to every woman. This design is iv three pieces,
besides the sleeTe, Front is seamless, hanging
straight from the shoulders. The back is in
two pieces buttoning in center. The sleeves
ar<> the bishop shape.
Plain or striped ginghams make most ser-
vioeabie aprons. Such fabrics as lawn or nain
sook may be used if something more dainty is
desired.
Lounging or bath robes can be made after
this same design by cutting the back in one
piece and cutting the front in two, and allow
ing a hem on both sides.
It is desirable also for night dresses, which
are dainty and comfortable, made in this way
A deep frill of lace or embroidery may be used
to finish the neck, and may be substituted for
cuffs on the sleeves.
For amateur artists' aprons denim is often
used. This also makes a serviceable areas for
housekeepers to wear in the kitchen.
CONVENTION OF THE FUTURE
Chlcago Tribune.
It was the afternoon of the third day of the
great convention.
The chairman recogn ized the delegate from
Maryland.
Comine forward to the platform the states
man mounted it and turned slowly and im
pressively toward the audience.
"Fellow-members of this convention," he
said, deeply moved by the solemnity of the
occasion and the importance of the mission he
had been selected by his constituents to fulfill.
"I can hardly express the emotions of my
heart as I survey this vast and attentive assem
bly and realise the momentous issues of the
campaign upon wnich we are soon to enter
The responsibility that rests upon us to dis
charge faithfully the duties that have called
us together is one we cannot evade. The peo
ple will hold us to a strict accountability for
our actions here.
"The eyes of the Nation are upon us. Trade
and commerce await with enter expectation
or with silent dread the outcome of our delib
erations. Upon the wisdom or folly of the
transactions of this body may hinge the des
tinies of the Western Hemisphere. It is,
therefore, wi;h no ordinary feeling of pride
that I take occasion here and now to present
to this convention a gavel made from a por
tion of the fence that once surrounded the his
toric spot of ground where grew the cherry
tree cnt down by the illustrious George Wash
ington, Father of His Country, in the days of
his Innocence and trusting youth." [Long
and prolonged applause.]
â¢â¢The sergeant-at-arnis will *ake charge of
the gavel," Announced the chairman in a dU
tincL and somewhat monotonous tone of voice,
"and place it in the gavel annex of the con
vention hall. It is my duty now to state," he
added, "that the two days and a half set apart
under the regular rules for the presentation
of gavels have now expired. We will pass on
therefore, to the consideration of the business
next in order. Is the committee on perma
nent organisation ready to report?"

THE FINANCIAL PLANK.
Santa Cruz Sentinel.
Would the passage by a Be public* a Congress
of a law for the free coinage of silver inde
pendently of the action of other nations be ir
reconcilab.y inconsistent with the financial
plank in the platform? Most people, after a
casual reading of the plank, would probably
answer this question in the affirmative. But
we think it Is not difficult to show that the
question reasonably admits of a negative an
"We are unalterably opposed to every meas
ure calculated to debase our currency or im
pair the credit of our country. We are, there
iore, opposed to the free coinage of silver, ex
cept by international agreement with the lead
ing commercial nations of the world, which
we pledge ourselves to promote, and until such
an agreement can be obtained the existing
gold standard must be preserved. All our sil
ver and paper currency must be maintained at
parity with gold." This is the substance of
the financial plank.
It will be observed that the party Dledges
itself to maintain the silver and paper cur
rency of tne Nation upon a plane of equality
with gold. This is what the party specifically
promises to do. The party also says that v
opposes the free coinage of silver except by
agreement with other nations, but it expressly
bases that opposition upon the hypothesis that
such independent free coinage would tend to
deDase the currency or impair the credit of the
country. The opposition to such coinage is
predicated upon the mere opinion or belief
that the currency would thereby be debased.
There is no pledge that such opinion or belief
will remain unchanged. The only positive
promise made is that the silver and 'paper cur
rency shall be kept equal with gold as money.
This is the grand object to be accomplished.
The party says lhatitdoes not bolieve that this
enn be accomplished if free silver coinage were
restored in thjs country at the Dresent time,
and therefore it opposes such action.
Now, if during the progress of the financial
discussion that will agitate the country be
tween now and the time when the Republican
party takes possession of all branches of thf
Government, it should become clear and plain
beyond the possibility of reasonable refuta
tion that the only way to prevent tbe debase
ment of the currency and the impairment of
National credit and to maintain the silver and
paper currency equal to gold, is to restore free
silver coinage without waiting for other na
tions to act in the matter, it would clearly be
the duty of a Republican Congress to pass a
free coinage law and the duty of a Republican
President to sign it, and if it were done there
would not only be no violation but a faithful
observance of the main pledge in the financial
plank of the platform, to wit: the promise to
keep ail kinds of the Nation's currency at a
parity with gold.
If it becomes as plain to a majority of Re
putlican members of Congress as it now is to
thousands of logical thinkers that the Cleve
lana-Carlisle plan of borrowing gold to keep
up the parity of tbe currency is powerless to
accomplish that object ana tends directly to
the destruction of such parity and the conse
quent debasement of the currency and impair
ment of the Nation's credit, and thai free silver
coinage is the only possible means of keeping
every dollar of the Nation's money as good as
any other dollar, it would be incumbent upon
those members to act in accordance with their
convictions; and if they did so and passed a
free silver coinage law they would act con
sistently with the spirit of tne financial plank
of their party platform.
Republicans should understand that inde
pendent free silver coinage advocates, in
ternational free silver coinage advocates and
honest bimetallists of ail shades of opinion can
consistently stand together on the Republican
platform and each in his own way fight the
common enemy, the gold mo no metal lists.
A PROGRESSIVE DAILY.
Portland (Or.) Universal Republic.
The Call (San Francisco, Cal.) is keeping up
its record as one of the most progressive dailies
by advocating the enfranchisement of women.
It says: "The Call, desirin gto represent the
progressive spirit of the age. and believing it
to be the duty and opportunity of the Republi
can party to assume this position of advanced
enlightenment, urges that the value of women
in politics be recognized as equal to that
which they exercise in all the other affairs ot
coramunitv life, and to this end, that they be
given a suffrage equal to that enjoyed by men.
In order that the readers of this paper may
have an opportunity to study an Intelligent
exposition of the women's cause â which is the
cause of all â the services of Miss Ida Harper,
whose able communication appeared in last
Sunday* issue, have been enlisted, and com
munications from her will appear from time
to time hereafter. The efforts of The Call will
not stop there. It will unreservedly advocate
the movement and promote by every means in
Its power the early success of this great re

Quarantine Complications
on Board of the
Mariposa.
AN OFFICIAL BOAT RACE.
Two Sets of Papers Had to Be
Mads Out to Satisfy
the Law.
THE RAT PIT OF THE CZARINA.
Men From the Adams Are Dissatisfied
and Many Have
Deserted.
Dr. Chalmers, the local quarantine
officer and Surgeon Rupert Blue of the
United States Marine Hospital service had
another spat yesterday. The Mariposa,
from Australasia, was spoken about 9
A. m. and both quarantine officers were
notified. It did not take the captain on
the Governor Perkins long to get steam
up, and Captain John McFarland on the
Sternberg at once followed suit. Both
vessels reached the Mariposa about the
same time, but the United States officer
held sway and Purser Smith was com
pelled to produce two sets of "ship's
paoers." Drs. Chalmers and Blue both
went over the list of steeraee passengers,
and after a careful examination allowed
them to land.
When the whaleback City of Everett ar
rived last Wednesday, Dr. Chalmers
boarded her and passed on her papers.
In consequence Captain Buckman docked
his ship, and yesterday morning he made
preparations to begin discharging his ves
sel. An order from the United States
quarantine officials stopped proceedings,
however, and it was 10 a. m. before the
matter was straightened out. As the mat
ter now stands all vessels from foreign
ports must have a clearance from the
United States quarantine officer and the
State quarantine officer. One is no good
without the other according to the au
thorities at Washington, and the sooner a
~hange is made the better it will be for
tio'e shipping interests of San Francisco.
The Mariposa brought the following pas
senger list:
From Australiaâ Hon. W. S. and Mrs. North,
Colonel and Mrs. Santa Maria, Mr. and Mrs. 8.
Allen. Mr. nnd Mrs. W. D. Hagpard, Mr. and

The Mariposa brought up four black
swans and a wallaby for the park. The
miniature kangaroo stood the voyage weJl
but the swans did not fare so we'll. They
drooped during the midocean run but be
gan to picK up as soon as the coast of Cali
fornia loomed up. They \v ill be in Stow
Lake to-day ready to welcome the glorious
Fourth.
Among the arrivals on the Mariposa
yesterday was Mrs. W. H. Avery, wife of
the popular representative of the Pacific
Mail Company. Six months ago she left
here an invalid, but a tour of the South
Sea Islands has restored her to perfect
health and she looked like a new woman
as she stepped off the gangplank of the
Mariposa yesterday.
Captain Towbry of the bark Don Carlos
was also a passenger. While at Honolulu
his leg was broken and he was compelled
to come to San Francisco for medical
treatment.
Lieutenant Lasker of the Adams is here
on a peculiar mission. His wife accom
panies him, and, while he is apparently
on "sick leave," it is known that he is on
"recruiting service." Over a score of
men have deserted, and the vessel is
short-handed. Some of the deserters
came up on sailing ships, and the Aloha
had two of them when she arrived in port
a few days ago. Tne J. G. North had sev
eral, and the Alden Bessie and Robert
Lewis had one or two more. All in all,
the crew of the Adams seems to be more
than discontented, judging by latest ac
counts.
The steamer Syarina, lying at Folsom
street wharf, is infested with rats. Cats
will not tackle them, and the night watch
man is kept awake keeping the rodents
away from the soles of his shoes. If he
ever dares take a wink they start in on
his feet covers, and their gnawing soon
wakes him up. The hold of the vessel is
now almost empty, and a ratting main
may be arranged.
Vallejo is to have a water carnival to
morrow night and excursions are in order.
Piper, Aden, Goodall & Co. will not run
the Sunol, a.s they say all the townspeople
should remain at home on that occasion.
In consequence their vessel will not leave
her dock and no one will be able to get
here from Vallejo on the Fourth on the
Sunol. San Francisoo people, however,
will be able to get to Vallejo, as Mannie
Fogel will run the Ida W from here to
Vallejo and back, thus giving all a chance
to view the carnival.
Tom Sbarkey visited the Charleston
yesterday. Ah soon as he set his foot on
the raneplank the boys seized him and
carried him si.oulder high all over the
ship. He was the herooi the hour, and as
such was treated by t':e officers.
Captain Parker of the launch Belvidere
will curry pas-sen^em to the Charleston on
July 4 and 5. He will run excursions at
short intervals during both days.
A PECULIAU LAND DEAL.
A. B. SprrckelÃ Sue* John Norman for
Selling laid Not His Own.
A. B. SpreckJe has entered suit against
John Norman because of a transaction in
which Norman conveyed land in Coos
County, Oregon, to Mr. Spreckels.
It is claimed that Norman had no title
to a portion of the land which he sold to
the San Francisco man. Norman received
$9500 cash at the time of the trims er and
promissory notes for $55,000, payable July
1, 1896. July 1, 1897, and July 1, 18'J8, were
made to cover the balance of the purchase
price.
Judge Slack has issued a restraining
order, prohibiting Norman from nego
tiating the paper until the case can be
heard in court.

ALMA JOSSLYN
AS HIS WIFE.
Dr. Marten Will Appeal to
the Board of Health
for Help.
LOVE LETTERS SHOWN.
The Doctor Says the Girl Was
Intimidated Into Repudiat
ing Him.
LOGAN CALLS MARTEN CRAZY.
Miss Josslyn Still Confined and Ex
cluded Particularly From
Reporters.
The Josslyn- Marten case has taken a
new turn. In life or song or story, "the
course of true love never did run
smoothly."
Where yesterday threats to kill were
uppermost to-day real tears and sighs re
place them.
When the alarm bell of his office door
sounded yesterday afternoon a German
physician, his hair newly combed back
from his forehead, appeared suddenly
through a side door. He was Dr. Arthur
Marten, who is out on bail on a charge of
threatening to kill Alma Josslyn, the deli
cate young woman he has lived with three
years and who has borne him two babies.
Whoever has seen Sol Smith Russell in
"The Poor Relation" and the "shabby gen
teel," will see a picture of the Dr. Marten
of to-day. But it was not always so with
the doctor. A few years ago he wore dia
monds almost as large as a thumb-nail,
even to the extent of baring one in his
collar-button. When arrested last Wednes
day afternoon he had 30 cents in his pos
session.
When the caller from The Call intro
duced himself the doctor's eyes at once
filled with tears, and the first thing he said
was:
"Oh, my heart is broken! I am a
ruined man! God help the mother of my
two babes!"
Then the physician impulsively pulled
himself together, and in a few moments
waÂ« calm. The scene and the action were
dramatic, but he did not seem to have
purposely made them so. His emotion was
genuine or he is a subtler actor than Sol
Smith Russell ever was.
The new turn the case baa taken !
is this: Dr. Marten declared his inten
tion of taking the case of Miss Josslyn
immediately before the Board of Health.
He claims that the young woman was not
completely treated in her recent confine
ment, that she is suffering from puerpal
mania, and is being imposed upon and in
timidated by his enemies and hers, for its i
effect on the suit now pending of Miss j
Josslyn arrainst George Staacke for $50,000 i
damages for seduction.
In order to expose his affection for Miss
Josslyn, and tier love for him, the doctor
â bowed several letters she had recently j
written him, and several he had written â 
her, which he had taken from the pillow I
of her conch the last time he visited her j
at 1322 Mission street. These letters !
breathed love in every paragraph. They j
were not model letters, according to liter- j
ary rules, but the expression was there, i
and plenty of it, and "love understands." ;
The pet names that each applies to the i
other in the letters is "Pummie." This the i
doctor confidingly explained is on abbre
viation of that yellow, solid and succulent
vegetable, the pumpkin. It means, " Anna
you are my pumpkin and I am yours."
Don Juan might have envied the fervor of
these epistles.
Dr. Marten, in telling his story, said:
"The last letter I received from Alma was
dated Jtfne2l. As you see it is replete
with affection, though my soul detects a
change in its tone which you cannot see.
It speaks abont putting the babes in an
orphan asylum as though I knew all about
it, but I have never mentioned orpnan
asylum to her on any of my visits. I love
those children and her. She bore them
for me. I will defend and protect them
all with the last drop of my blood," and
saying this the doctor significantly tapped
!n> wrist.
"I have learned," he continued, "that
soon after my wife â "
Dr. Marten evidently did not mean to
use the word wife. He recovered himself
quickly and resumed â
"I found out that not long after Alma
went to the house of Mrs. Small, at 1322
Mission street, a woman took board and
lodging there. She was a sort of Spiritual
ist. Pummie mentions her in one of her
letters to me. These letters came by a
messSnger-boy, or by Dr. Lo an, who at
tended her confinement for me. Now,
this woman boarder has, taking advantage
of Pummie's weak physical and nervous
condition, intimidated her and turned her
against me. Ido not know who sent this
woman there. The result is that I have
not been ahle to see her for two weeks
and she has brought a suit against me in
another woman's name for threatening to
kill her. Why I would , kill myself before
I would harm a hair of her head. Why,
during the years that we have lived
together we have not had even a cross
look.
"I took her up and befriended her when
others had cast her out. Later, we became
more intimate. My time and most of my
money has since >:one to the defense of
her honor, and I am in that fight to stay.
If at this time I should say I am her hus
band, it might be a legal error in consid
eration of the other suit. If any money is
received in that suit her attorney has been
directed to give it to an orphan asylum
and in other charities. Why, Staacke pro
posed to compromise with me in my
claim for niedical services, and I would
not accept it.
"This young woman is suffering from
mania as a result of childbirth. I know
it," he said. "She has had 3 degrees of
fever for weeks. Think of thatl You
know a woman fades like lightningâ in
two or three months sometimes. I know
what is the matter with her. They are
poisoning her against me and trying to
till her for their own purposes. But they
shall not be able to do it. I shall go to
the Board of Health, demand an investi
gation, and we shall then see who is right.
Oh, if 1 could only see her," said the
doctor plaintively. "I know she would
put her arms around my neck and kiss
me."
Dr. M. H. Logan attended the last con
finement of Miss Josslyn for Dr. Marten.
He says he heard her tell officers of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children that Dr. Marten had threatened
her life. He says she is weak and nervous
ami on the verge of consumption. Drs.
Logan and Marten have offices on Grant
avenue, between Geary and Post streets.
The former remembers when, several years
ago, Dr. Marten was resplendent with dia
monds. He now says:
"Dr. Marten seemed to have plenty of
money several years ago, but recently he
has not been so well off. He eot me to at
tend to this case, saying the young woman
had an estate and that I would eventually
be paid out of it when it was settled up.
"He has seemed to have some great bur
den on his mind for some months," Dr.
Logan said. "He talked about being
ruined and broken-hearted, but he never
explained why. His actions were very
peculiar. I do not think the doctor is
mentally sound. He called on her, but
she was afraid and would not see him.
He sent her medicine. which she was afraid
to take, and the thermometer he sent to
take her temperature was never used by
her. It always registered 103, which is an
abnormal temperature, and that one thing
made Dr. Marten suspect that she was
not treated properly. The young woman
is doing nicely. The only thing the mat
ter is that she is afraid Dr. Marten will
kill her and their babes and she won't see
him.
"She admits that she was forced to
make an affidavit in the Staacke case that
was untrue," Dr. Logan said, "which
amounts to blackmail.' 1 And so the doc
tors disagree.
Dr. Marten has been living at his office
and in Oakland with Miss Josslyn several
years. Tnere is no doubt that the doctor
would not hesitate to say they are legally
married if there were not legal reasons in
the way at present,
Miss Josslyn is still with Mrs. Small at
1322 Mission street. Nobody is allowed to
see her, particularly reporters. Mrs.
Small receives visitors at ths bottom of
j the front steps. Yesterday afternoon she
talked to a Call reporter there, saying:
"I am not allowed to talk and 1 have
nothing to say. We have instructions to
let nobody in to see Miss Josslyn.'
"Who are those instructions from, her
attorney?"
"That is our business," replied Mrs.
Small.
"Has Dr. Marten been hereto-day?" was
asked.
"No, sir. If he comes he will be ar
rested. The poor girl is afraid of him,
| and he shall not see her aerain. He made
| her worse every time he called. You need
not come here, because you can't see her."
While Mrs. Small talked thus decisively
j a lady inside advanced to the basement
1 window, pulled aside the lace curtains
and a face resembling Alma Josslyn's
peered out and then shrank from view.
MARTEN IN COURT.
Admission That the Girl Is His
Wife a Bar to Further
Prosecution.
Dr. Marten appeared in Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday morning to answer
the charge of threats to kill. He was rep
resented by Attorney Walter Gallagher,
who immediately moved for a dismissal of
the case on the grouud that the complaint
was defective, inasmuch as it had been
sworn to by Mrs. E. A. Basford, who was
not the complaining witness.
Tne Judge refused to dismiss the case,
but continued it until this morning, when
he said he would give his decision on the
motion.
Alma Josslyn was In court, accompanied
by Mrs. Basford and Officer McMurrav of
the Society for the Suppression of Vice!
Immediately after the case was con
tinued the defect in the complaint was
remedied by Alva Josslyn swearine to a
new complaint, which will be served upon
Dr. Marten in court this morning.
Dr. Marten is out on bonds, his bonds
men being Attorneys Gallagher and Mar
tin Quinlan. He wailed outside the court
room till Miss Josslyn went out. As soon
as he saw her he clasped his hands and ran
toward her, saying:
"Come to me, my darling; come tome."
Officer McMurray pushed him away, and
kept him at a respectful distance till the
girl and Mrs. Basford got safely out of the
ball.
it was the intention to prosecute the
doctor for betrayal under promise of mar
riage, but no steps in that direction will
be taken. The betrayal occurred five years
aeo when the i;irl was 15 years of age, and
besides his public admission that she is
his wife is a bar to prosecution.
MRS. CRAVEN STILL ILL.
The Hearing of the Case Postponed for
Another Week.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven was still too ill to
attend court yesterday and the inquiry
which was set to be heard before Judge
Slack was postponed for a we*k. Attor
neys for both sides were in court, but the
statement of the situation with regard to
Mrs. Craven met with no opposition.
The shooting that had taken place in
the court a short time before the hour
for the bearing made the court a ready
listener to a motion to postpone.

depositors $1,475,760, and this, it says,
should not be taxed. The $250,000, the
bunk claims, should not be taxed either,
and the value of the solvent credits should
be so scaled down by offsets as tv reduce
the total assessment to $459,063. The
Assessor has taken the cash, the agency
money and the solvent credits, and with
some offsets has made the total the
amount of his ass-essrnent.
The question which has arisen concerns
just what portions of the personal prop
erty of the bank is taxable. The bank
claims that money due from other banks
outside of the State is not taxable here,
for it is already taxed in the States where
it is held. Again, they claim that loans
on bonds are not taxable because the se
curity for the bonds, the property upon
which the bonds are issued, has already
been assessed, and to assess the loan as
well would be to assess the property twice.
In answer to this contention "the As
sessor claims that bonds are solvent
credits in the taxable sense of the word.
Loans upon them stand in the same rela
tion to the personal property tax as the
mortgage does to tne real property tax.
In the one the mortgage is deducted
from the value of the real estate and toe
tax is divided between the owner of the
property and the owner of the mortgage.
In the other case the borrower will make
his note as well as put up his bonds as col
lateral, the loan will be deducted from the
value of the bonds and the tax must be
divided between the bond-owner and he
who holds the bonds as security.
Assessor Siebe has taken for the basis of
his assessments on the banks the state
ments turned in to the Bank Commis
sioners, and not the sworn statement
made by them to him. Each bank has
rendered an account of its property, but
these have not been followed to any extent,
and so the banks are up in arms.
It had been announced that the taxes of
the City would be raised about $30,000,000
and of this amount $20,000,000 should be
secured from the banks and similar insti
tutions. To ihh end the statement, of the
banks to the Assessor were rejected as be
ing too low and their reports to the Bank
Commissioners were taken instead.
As soon as notified of the Assessor's in
tention the banks prepared for a contest,
and the result of the preparations is shown
in the suits just filed. There will be more
suits from the other banks and the whole
matter of bunk assessments will be brought
into court.
In the Assessor's office the case is ex
plained as a difference of opinion between
the Assessor and the banks as to what as
sets are liable for taxation and what are
exempt. Tiiis, the Assessor says, he wants
the court to determine, and hence his
course of assessment according to his own
ideas.
STRUCK THE WRONG MAN.
Jacob Wolf, a Barber, Arrested for
Bnttery Upon Frank J. Kane.
Jacob Wolf, a barber, made a mistake
last evening when he attempted to knock
out Frank J. Kane, Secretary of the Pacific
Coast Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children.
Mrs. Joseph, whose husband, a patrol
driver, recently committed suicide, went
to Kane's office on McAllister street yes
terday afternoon, accompanied by her
mother. They raised a disturbance and
Kane politely but firmly showed them the
door.
They "went to Wolf and complained to
him about Kane's treatment, and he went
to the office to demand satisfaction. He
struck Kane, who promptly placed him
under arrest, and, with the assistance of
Policeman T. J. Coleman, took him to the
City Prison, where a charge of battery was
booked against him.

POPULISTS UNITE
Some Interesting Statements
From One on the
Inside.
MAGUIRE'S CANDIDACY.
Populists May Support Him in
Return for a Fusion in
the Fourth.
ROGERS NAMED FOR MAYOR.
Warda 1 Says Sutro May Accept a Con
gressional Nomination From
the Fifth.
According to reports from the ranks of
both parties the Populists of this City have
arrived at what may be considered a har
monious agreement as to Congressional
nominations from the Fourth and Fifth
districts. Thougli the element of uncer
tainty still remains, owing to the action
on the monetary question that may be
taken by the Democratic National Con
vention at Chicago, yet it is commonly
believed that the slate will not be dis
turbed.
On the authority of a leading Populist
the leaders of that party have expressed
themselves as thoroughly satisfied with
the record of Judge Maguire in the
Fourth, ana therefore will make no nom
ination against him.
On the other hand, it is tacitly acknowl
edged that the Democrats, in considera
tion of this fact will make no nomination
in the Fifth, leaving that district solely to
the Populists.
Various prominent Democratic andPop
nlist politicians have met and discussed
this proposition with the result that
Mayor Sutro has been interviewed rela
tive thereto. Two men are commonly
spoken of as available among the Popu
lists for a candidacy in the Fifth, the
Mayor himself and Taylor Rogers. The
latter is personally in favor of the May
or's running.
Many Populists would prefer Rogers as
a candidate for Mayor rather than for
Congress. This is well known in political
circles of all parties, as those who are in
clined to think in that manner have made
no secret of it.
E. M. Wardall, chairman of the Popu
list State Central Committee, was ques
tioned in regard to the foretroing facts yes
terday and replied substantially as follows :
"In regard to a fusion of the Democrats
and Populists in the Fourth an<l Fifth, I
am not entireiy at liberty to speak. My
personal opinion is that it will depend in
grÂ«*ai part upon the attitude of the Demo
crats toward the money question in the
coming National Convention.
"As regards Judge Maguire lam willing
to put myself on record as saying that
the party with which I am arh'liated is
thoroughly satisfied with his record. In
fact, we regard him as a man who repre
sents vastly better principles than the
party of his choice.
"ijither the Mayor or Mr. Rogers would
be an acceptable candidate in the Fifth.
Rogers himself, I understand, is in favor
of the Mayor. The Mayor is anxious that
the City government should be conducted
in accordance with pure, clean and econ
omical principles. If he regards it as
necessary he is willing to be a candidate
again for the office of which he is the in
cumbent.
'"That Mr. Rogers is the choice of a
large number of Populists for the office of
Mayor is also true. But this must not be
taken as indicative of a split in the party.
Whoever is nominated will receive a
unanimous vote.
"There is one thing certain, however,
that is admitted by all. Nothing definite
in the way of selecting candidates for any
office will be done until after the Populist
Convention at St. Louis."
CRITTENDEN THORNTON'S BILL.
It Is Against Mrs. Auzerais-Hoyte and
as Long as the Law'i Arm.
The proceedings in the suit of Mrs. Crit
tenden Thornton against Mrs. Lucy
Auzerais-Hoyte were technical yester
day. The testimony heard was almost all
that of tradesmen, who told of the repairs
they had made in Mrs. Thornton's house
after Mr 3. Hoyte's departure.
It developed that $25 was paid for fixing
the inlaid floors, $25 for repairing the
clocks, $150 for going over the furniture
and other sums for cleaning carpets, cur
tains, etc.
Mr. Thornton's list of damages inflicted
on his defenseless belongings was filed in
evidence and in a long and curious docu
ment.
When court closed for the day the case
was still unfinished.

WHO IS MAYOR
OF THE TOWN?
Adolph Sutro Is Sunning
Himself at Cal
istoga.
NO SIGN OF HIS RETURN
Supervisor Taylor Declines to
Perform the Mayor's
Duties.
CONFUSION AT THE CITY HALL.
Supervisors Agree to Submit a
Tel?pbone Franchise Appli
cation.
Supervisor C. L. Taylor does not con
sider himself acting Mayor since Mayor
Sutro's leave of absence for sixty days
expired.
The Supervisor has special reasons for
not considering himself the acting Mayor
since the board last Tuesday morning
called Supervisor Benjamin to the chair
when the Geary-street franchise was pend
ing.
There were several callers at the Ciiy
Hall yesterday who particularly desired
that Supervisor Taylor should assert him
self and perform in the absence of Mayor
Sutro some of the functions which devolve
upon the chief executive. These inter
ested persons were connected with public
institutions rn;i wanted the Mayor's ap
proval of contracts for furnishing sup
plies. There was quite an accumulation
of unsigned resolutions in the Mayor's
ofiice and some members of the School
Board were in great trouble lest the bond
of the new School Director, Soper, could
not be approved in time for the afternoon
meeting of the Board of Education.
The panic spread in a mild form to
Supervisors Hughes, Benjamin, Dunker
and Morgenstern, "who were doing Street
Committee business with John A. Russell
and George W. Elder at the old stand.
Mr. Creswell was called down from the
lav; department to enlighten the Super
visors, ana when the legal adviser retired
from the committfe-room the Supervisors
knew very neariy as much as they did
before.
In a general way he said he would hesi
tate about voting with Colonel Taylor as
a City Hal! or Election Commissioner if
his own vote shouid give the majority re
quired for action. This indicated that Mr.
I'reswell entertained a doubt whether the
courts would recognize Colonel Taylor as
acting Mayor in "the absence of Mayor
Sutro. Still the City and County Attorney
diil not want this off-hand expression to
â¢"*Â£â  regarded as an official decision. The
Â i>r>ervi-ors were sdvised to communicate
riting the request for such informa
..'n aa they desired, and it was suggested
they should attach to the written
communication a copy of the resolution
appointing Colonel Taylor acting Mayor
and giving Mayor Sutro ieave of absence.
John A. Russell observed that the Board
of Supervisors had always exercised the
power of designating some Supervisor to
act as Mayor in the absence of the Mayor.
The resolution of April 20, 1896, simply
reads: "That Supervisor C. L. Taylor be
and is hereby appointed Mayor pro tern., to
perform the duties cf that office during
the absence of his Honor, Mayor Sutro."
It seems that Mayor Sutro was absent
for a period of sixty days or so and Colonel
Taylor acted as Mayor. But then Mr.
Sutro returned to town and performed his
duties for a day or two. Now he has gone
to his ranch near Calistoga, and if he does'
not return before the 4th. and if Colonel
Taylor persistently refuses to act.**s Mayor,
things may come to such a pass that an
all-night Fourth of July masquerade- ball
may take place without the sanction of
tbe" City b chief executive.
The Street Committee of the board yes
terday decided by a unanimous vote to
recommend that the application of the
People's Mutual Telephone Company for
a franchise be submitted. Two applica
tions were pending. The other was from
Herman de Laguna. Some time ago both
propositions were referred to the City and
County Att6rney in order that the board
might be advised as to which one should
be submitted. Of the two the Attorney
found the Lauuna proposition the better,
as it provided a pe'ierous tender of free
facilities to the municipality. The Peo
ple's Compauv gave the City the free use
ol forty telephones within two years.
Laguna offered 100 telephones free for the
first ten years and fifty additional there
after.
The Supervisors have not been able to
ascertain very much about Laguna'a in
tentions. He was heard from at Stockton
in reference to the Geary-street franchise.
He appeared once before the Street Com
nrttee and made a eood impression, but a
doubt is entertained whether he means
business as a promoter of cheaper tele
phone service. Tne committee has re
ceived information showing that he has
displayed wonderful energy us a franchise-
i eeter in Los Angeles and other cities.
Attorney Robert A. Friedrich, speaking
for the People's Telephone Company,
pointed to a petition signed by 7000 citi
zens of San Francisco asking that this
company should get a franchise. He was
not ascending a nigh mouirain and offer
ing everything in sight for a franchise,
but did promise that the promoters of the
People's iiutual Company would put in
modern, tirst - class instruments and
cheapen th' cost of telephony in San
Francisco. The Supervisors agreed with
out a dissenting voice to rerommend the
submission of his company's application
for a franchise.

VICTORY FOR CHALMERS.
The State'it Quarantine Officer Drawi
First Blood From the Federal
Authorities.
Dr. Chalmers wins first blood in the
quarantine h'^ht now going on between
the State and Federal authorities. Yes
terday Collector Wise received the follow
ing telegram :
Washington, D. C, July 2, 1896.
Collector of Custom n, .Saw Francisco, Cal.: Do
not refuse entry of vessels which have a certi
ficate from either National or local quarantine
officer until further instructed.
W. E. Curtis, Acting Secretary.
It is not thought in customs circles that
the Government will allow the State to in
terfere go I'ar as forÂ«Mc:n vessels are con
cerned. The present step is taken with a
view of learning just what power the
Federal authorities have in the matter of
vessels coming irom any Pacinc British-
American port. As soou as this point is
clearly established it is believed that Dr.
Rosenan will be given exclusive control of
quarantine affairs. Should such action
be taken Dr. Chalmers will probably make
a lively light to retain his position.

ONE CERTIFICATE ISSUED
The Chamber of Commerce Now
Passes on Seamen's Quali
fications.
Every Master and Mate Must Neces
sarily Pass an Examination in
Navigation.
The Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco has issued its first certificate to
a California seaman. It authorizes him
to act as chief officer of any American
ship, and Capiain William L. Merry of
The I irst Certificate Issued lo Master .Mariners by th; Chamber of C< mmerce. In Future Every
Master and Mate Who Wants to Command a San Francisco Owned Ship Must Possess One.
the examining board says the candidate
passed a more than creditable examina
tion.
The parchment reads:
Oro en Ptiz: en Guerra, Fierro.
No. IâThe1 â The Chamber ol Commerce ol San
Francisco hereby certifies that Walter Claude
Aust. a citizen of the United States, has been
registered as chief officer.
This certificate has been granted after an
examination in seamanship ami navigation
and upon evidence of good character.
It may be revoked at the pleasure of the
trustees of the Chamber of Commerce, after
due investigation, either by written notice to
the holder hereof cr through the public press.
Given and certified with the heal of the
Chamber of Commerce, San Francisco, Cali
fornia, this 12th duy of June, 1896.
The new chief officer is a graduate of
McNevin Bros.' school, and hi 3 teachers
are more than satisfied with the good
showing he made before the examining
ooard. The following letter, sent to them
by Captain Merry, will be of interest to all
shipping men:
In reply to your inquiry I beg to state that it
has been decided by the examiners on seaman
ship and navigation that the following requis
ite are necessary (in navigation) to pass:
First (for master)â Latitude by meridian
altitude of the sun.
Secondâ Longitude by chronometer.
Thirdâ One method of lntKude out of the
meridian either long or short, double alti
tudes or reduction to meridian.
Fourthâ Shir)'.Â« position l>y account.
For chief officerâ Xos. 1, 2and 4 as above.
Any work beyond these requirements will of
course go to the credit of the party, but is not
made necessary. It will be the nim of the ex
aminers to make the examination practical,
and gentlemen will be permitted to make good
any error by subsequent work, provided other
wise satisfactory.
The Chamber of Commerce examining
board is composed of Captain W. L. Merry
and Captain D. O. nJ. Wilson. It may now
be said to bo in full swing and merchants
and ship-owners are glad that it is. Hither
to masters and officers have had no cre
dentials to show except those obtained
from a navigation school, and while these
carry full "weight Etili it was thought
necessary that the chamber would do
something in the matier. The result is
the issuance of the first certificate to
Walter Claude Aust.

TIE CONTEST,

Matches.
WAS DECLARED A DRAW.
Spectators Wanted to See the
Fight Proceed to the
Limit.
REFEREE SULLIVAN EXPLAINS.
Jeffries Favorably Impressed the Audi
ence by Knocking Long Oat
in Two Rounds.
The first fistic carnival planned by the
New Occidental Club came off at the
Pavilion last night. It resulted in Danny
Mahoney being declared the victor over
Joe Sullivan, Jim Jeffries knocking Dan
Long out in the second round ana the
contest between "Mysterious" Smith and
Gallagher being declared a draw.
As early as 7 o'clock in the evening
ticket-holders began to arrive, and soon a
large crowd had congregated in front of
the doors. Captain Wittman was present
with a squad of policemen, part of whom
ker.t the doors cleared on the inside, while
I the rest kept the sidewalk open for pedes
trians.
The hall filled rather slowly, but by 9
o'clock, the hour at which the boxing
began, the vast building was pretty well
occupied.
The boxing besran with a six-round bout
between Danny Mahony and Joe Sullivan.
As the little fellows stepped into the ring
they were generously applauded.
Billy Jordan acted as master of cere
monies, and after announcing the names
of the contestants stated that Jimmy
Carrol would act as referee for the bout
and B. J. Tooy as official time-keeper for
the series.
Sul.ivan appeared the heavier of the
two, while Mahony looked overtrained.
The contest for the whole six rounds was
spirited, and the little fellows punched
each orher often and viciously. Both
werj generously cheered throughout the
contest, and at the expiration the fight
was given to Mahony on points.
The next battle was a ten-round go be
tween James J. Jeffries of L03 Ansreles
and Dan Long of Denver. Billy fcmith
and Aiex (Jrepgains acted as seconds for
the former, and Danny Mullen, together
with Sam Barbour, handled the towels
for the latter.
Amid tremendous applause Joe Choynskl
was named as the referee. When he step
ped into the ring with a good-natured
smile illuminating his countenance, he
was given an ovation. It was plain that
Choynski was a hero in the eyes of the
spectators.
As the men shook handn. preparatory to
an endeavor to send each other to the Land
of Nod, Jeffries was seen to be much the
heavier man of the pair, having perhaps
twenty pounds the best of his opponent in
avoirdupois. His brawny physique made
Long seem slender in comparison. It was
freely prophesied by the sports that Long
would not last three rounds. Events
proved the truth of this prognostication.
As the men scarred for an opening Long
was srr.iling and confident and did some
very pretty dancing around. Jeffries, on
the other hand, was serious in aspect, but
cool and" collected. The determined set of
his jaws demonstrated that his intention
was to put his opponent out as soon as
possible.
Jeffries led with his left, missed and
clinched. Long hit low with his left,
whereupon both struck and clinched.
Jeffries made a vicious jab at Long's head
with his ripht, but the blow was cleverly
ducked.
There was a rally. Long countered with
his right, and received a sledge-ham me?
blow on the point of his chin from Jeffries'
right that floored him.
He had hardly regained his feet when
Jeffries again countered on the point of his
jaw with a right-hand blow that knocked
him off his feet again.
The second round opened with a rush
from Long, who struck and miseed, fall
ing from tjje force of his own blow. Jef
fries then banged nim rigbt and left. Hot
infighting followed, Jeffries hitting Long
every which way.
Finally lie landed a terrific blow on the
point of the jaw. Long sank to the floor
and was counted out.
The event of the evenine, which, accord
ing to Master of Ceremonies Billy Jordan,
was to be a ten-round contest between
i "Mvsterions" Billy Smith, late of Eng
land, and Billy Gallagher of Los Angeles,
but late of Oakland, was stopped near the
end of the first round by Captain Witt
man of the police force.
Gallagher of Los Angeles was the first to
put in an appearance. He was esquired by
Billy Smith, the Australian, and J. J.
1 Jeffries, the heavy-weight, who whipped
Dan Long. The mysterious man, com-.
monly known as Billy Smith, late of Eng
land, was attended by Alexander Greg
gains, the political fireman, and Timothy
McGrath, the confidential adviser and
rubber-down of Tom Sharkey, tne famous
slogger of Uncle Sam's navy." Mike Sulli
van, the right-bana bower of Billy Harri
son of the old Pacific Club, was selected as
referee, and when he made his inaugural
bow to the boys there were several among
the spectators who recognized the old
Jumiliar face and bald pate. D. J. Tobie
wa3 selected as the official referee.
Everything being ready for business, the
referee held a short consultation with the
pugilists. It was presumed that Mr. Sul
livan was instructing the fighters not to
break the rules of Queensbery and that to
insure a fair content they must break
away when ordered to do so.
Gallagher broke from his chair the mo
ment he heard the sound of the gong and
met his opponent, "the Mysterious," half
way between chairs.
The fiÂ»hters were very evenly matched
in every particular, and the lovers of the
good old sport looked forward to a great
mill. Gallagher of Oakland was the first
to open the argument of the evening. He
led with the left at Smith's sharpened
face, but the latter ducked neatly, and the
blow shot over Smith's shonlder'and spent
itself on the midnight atmosphere.
The Mysterious smiled, and, changing
his position, quickly he let %o a wicked
drive at Gallagher's sun-browned face.
The glove grazed Gallagher's jaw and a
clinch resulted. The fighters bad now
warmed up for business, and Smith, an
ticipating that Gallagher would resort to
his old tricks, watched his actions closely.
Gallagher swung his left at the Mysteri
ous' jaw and landed a pretty good stiff
one on the neck. He tried twice to follow
with a right swing, but Smith ducked and
caught Gallagher a neat jab in the short
ribÃ. Another clinch and then the dirty
work commenced.
Smith tried to Bhake the Los Angeles
hugger off, but failing in the attempt he
j gave Gallagher the hip and pitched him
on the floor. Gallagher looked savage as
j he regained his pins ana dashed at fcSmith.
A few exchanges followed and another
clinch resulted. Both men were punch
ing as best they could with their rights
while their lefts were entangled around
| each other's necks. Smith in the shuffle
cot Gallagher on his hip and in a jiffy sent
j him sprawling on the boards.
The spectators now looked for a good old
rough and tumble game and they were
not disappointed. Gallagher concluded
that his opponent intended to resort to
every game in the business and he deter
mined to use every scheme he possessed
to equalize matters. Once again they met
and Gallagher wild and wooliy smashed at
Smith with right and left. The right
missed Us mark, but the left came to aiull
stop on Smith's nose, drawing the claret
Smith was wild and excited. HÂ« rushed
at his antagonist, who ducked a wicked
right-hand swing aud then clinched.
This was the clinch of the season. With
right arms free they smashed at each
other regardless of where their blows
I landed. Fouls did not count with them,
j and the referee being; unable to separate
! them, the Captain of Police, Wittman,
toot a band in tbe game, and ducking
under the ropes in the most approved
style, he tried to make the human bull
dogs break away.
Sufficient to say that the captain and
his staff had no easy task In separating
the combatants.
When Gallagher and Smith were dis
patched to their corners Captain Wittman
said: "Gentlemen, I will tolerate boxing
contests, but no slogging; if the fighters
can select a referee who will see that a
fair boxing contest is carried on, I will
not object, but this slogging game I will
certainly not permit."
Just as soou as Captain Wittman gave
his ultimatum Referee Sullivan declared
the contest a draw, much to the disgust
and chagrin of the spectators, who paid an
admission fee to see this contest in partic
ular.
Billy Jordan, the master of ceremonies,
who had held a short interview with Gal
lagher and Smith, shouted for order, and
when silence cane he announced that
Gallagher refused to go on with the fight
as long as the referee had decided the
match a draw.
That ended all argument and the spec
tators departed from the Pavilion thor
oughly disgusted with the outcome.
Immediately after the contestants had
entered their dressing-rooms. Smith as
serted that he would licht George Green
at auy place and at nnv time he might
name after his fight in Portland Or., with
Billy Evans, the lGth inÂ«U
"1 want to take Green first," he de
clared, "and if he refuses to make a
match, I will take Ryan at 144 pounds.
"Gallagher is a cur. Why didn't he
keep on when Captain Wittman said be
would let the fient proceed if a compe
tent referee could be found. He had had
all that he wanted; that was the trouble
with him. His own seconds were unable
to hold him in his corner, he was so
anxious to tret off the stage."
"Young" Mitchell said the directors will
meet to-morrow and consider Gallagher's
getting half the purse. They had commu
nicated to him, he said, that they were en
tirely dissatisfied with Gallagher's action
In refusing to proceed with the tight, and
might conclude not to allow him a cent.
The following letter from Referee Sulli
van is self-explanatory.
San Francisco, Cal., July 2, 1896.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
At this particular time I wish to thoroughly
justify my connection with laet uigbt's con
test and place myself on record as a sportsman
of years in ibU City. The contest, If such it
might be termed for the sake of an explana
tion, was little better than a hugging match,
and, believing the participants would take
cognizance of my instructions prior to com
nu-ncing, I refrained from making this Greco-
Koman match, three handed until the Inter
vention of Sergeant Wiitman.
From him I understood that this style of
battle would not be tolerated snd was only too
wiling to give a quick decision on this
misunderstanding and retire. Left to a
proper, just and equitable decision on the
menu of both participants, It is my judgment
that it should be and is declared no contest,
and the participants are remanded to the Club
Directiory. ji. J. Sullivan, j
JOE CHOYNSKI
AND PETER MAHER
The Irish Champion Will
Come West to Meet the
Californian.
A TEN-ROUND CONTEST.
Eddie Gracey Received a Favor
able Answer From Maher
Yesterday.
OFFERS MADE BY THE CLUB 3.
Full Particulars of the Battle in New
York Between the Australian
and the Irishman.
Peter Maher, the champion heavy
weight pueilist of Ireland, telegraphed
Eddie Granev yesterday from New York
that he has finally concluded to visit the
Pacific Coast again and that if Choynski
will meet him in a ten-round contest at
the Pavilion a match can be consummated.
Choynski had all preparations made to
leave this City to-day for New York,
where he expected to meet Jlaher in a
limited contest. He is much more pleased
to remain in this City and box Maher
under the auspices of whichever club that
wiil offer the most tempting inducements
in the way of good hard coin.
Graney said that Maher took the right
view of the situation when he decided to
meet the native son in his native city, not
because Choynski will be accorded any
better treatment here than Maher.
i; The Irishman lias numerous friends
and supporters in San Francisco," said
Graney, "and he knows right well that he
will be given fair play here by the club
under whose auspice 3he will box against
Choynski.
"In New York the police are very ayt to
stop a contest between clever men until
such time as the Horton bill will take ef
fect. Maher is aware of this fact an 1 I
think he has acted wisely in deciding
upon a trip to the coast. The Olympic
Club of this City has offered a purse of
$4< 00 for â *. co between Maher and Choyn
ski, but the National Club has gone one
better with an offer of .**> < ami in all
probability the contest wilt take place un
der its management, unless some other
club offers better inducements in the
meantime. We will only recognize, in the
language of the auctioneer, the highest
bidder for cash.
'â¢Choynski is now in pretty good condi
tion and with a few weeks' training he
will be fit to meet the best man living."
As only a very meager description of
the Slavin and Maher contest was tele
graphed from New York, readers of pugii
lstic sports can glean Irom the following
account, culled from an Eastern exchange,
how the Irishman handled the big burly
Australian in a few short rounds. The
report says:
When the lighters met each other in the cen
ter of the ring for the tirst round, Slavin was
seen to be head and shoulders over his oppon
ent. No time was lost in fiddling, for the Aus
tralian immediately shot out his right and
Maher quickly shifted aside and the blow went
sliding over his Lack.
Savin tried again and missed, and Maher
let go his left and caught the Australian on
the cheekbone. This did not phase Slavin.
who went piledriving at the Irishman, who
jumped back nimbly and returned quickly,
catching Sluvin right and left. It was a hot
round, indeed; as fine as ever seen between
two big men. Maher kept getting In his left
on Slavin's cheekbone until it was as red as a
raw steuk. The crowd soon discovered that
Maher was the master and the wildest cheer
ing took place.
They exchanged straight lefts on the neck
and face, hard swings on the head and body
and were so earnest about it that Acting In
spector llark'ycame within an ace oi stopping
it. But the bell was rung and the round had
lasted a little over a minute.
The crowd began to beseech Maher to knock
his rival out in the second round and he smiled
a wicked smile that made his friends look for
blood.
Slavin played for an opening and quickly
shot his left under the ear. It was a hard
blow, and Peter, expecting another like it,
clinched until the referee had to break the
men. Then the bulky Australian rushed
fiercely, both of his flail-like arms swinging
dangerously near Peter's head.
But the Irishman retreated to the ropes,
where he clinched. Slavin got home finally
a right hander on the side of the head, and
thnt seemed to stir Peter's blood, for with a
mighty rush he drove his left to the mouth
and banged Slavin over the heart with such
a terrific right that the Australian was almost
doubled up. Maher followed up thU advan
tage with a couple of sledge-hammers in the
neck, and Sluvin had to clinch to further avoid
the onslaught. He was groggy and hardly
able to reach his corner.
When thÂ«> third round began Slavin was suf
fering from lack of wind, and he moved about
so slowly tnat those who had seen him fight
Jake Kilrain some years ago could scarcely
believe that it was the same man.
Maher, on the other hand, was all activity.
He danced around his antagonist like a cooper
round a barrel, and jabbed him In the face
with his straight left until he tut the flesh
under the right eye. The blood spurted forth
at once and trickled down Slavin's cheek, but
the battle continued, while the crowd yelled
in approval.
Maher sailed in with a vengeance and piled
blow after blow upon Frank's face and neck
Slavin, however, was game to the core and full
of fight, for he mixed it up with Peter and re
turned blow for blow. But the punches he de
livered were growing weaker every time he
drew back his brawny arm, and the biffs and
bangs that Maher was sending in were rapidly
making the lights in the Garden look like
myriads of twinkling stars to the conqueror of
Kilrain.
Finally Peter sent in his left to thÂ« cut un
der the eye and swung his right heavily upon
the jaw. S.avin reeled as if about to fall, but
the ropes proved a safeguard, and he was still
on his ieet, staggering about, when the bell
rang. Inspector Harley wanted to stop the
licht then and there, hut he was prevailed
upon to let it go just one round more.
So the bell clanged again, and the gladiators
came to the center of the stage with careful
steps and hands rer.dy to do as much damage
as possible.
Blavin's eyes were staring vacantly as he
tried to hit Maher in the face, and then Peter
swung his left flush on the jaw. The blow was
well aimed, and had so much beef back of it
that Slavin was knocked against the ropes.
He bounded off in semi-helpless fashion, and
Instinctively tried to land a left swing.
Ouce more Maher let go his left, followed by
a tremendous right. Both hands landed on
the Australian's lseck ami jaw, and he pitchea
forward as if blind. O:ie more punch was
needed to put him to sleep, but before Maher
could get it inâ and he warned to badlyâ the
lofereo caught Slaviu in his arms and stopped
the fight. Slavin sugpert-d to his corner like a
man who had been hit with a mallet and fell
into his chair.
After tlie battle Maher was interviewed and
said, in answer to a question why he failed to
knock the Australian out: "I couldn't deliver
a b:ow with any force. The boards were loose
ami so springy that I couldn't set a firm fort
ing; besides 1 came near falling several times,
as one board was above the other."
Shortly alter the conversation Maher and
Slavin met at the Gilsey House and they shook
hands, drinking each other's health. Maher
drank lemonade and Slavin beer.
"You are fighting for glory, Peter, and I'm
after money. You must give me another
chance."
"Vis, any time," answered Maher, good
naturedly.
"That fellow Is made of iron, indeed," said
Peter, as he left the hotel. "He can stand a
lot of punching, Indeed."

A NOVEL SPECTACLE,
The City Wheelmen's Approach
ing Grand Lantern
Parade.
It Will Take Place on the Night of
the 25thâ A Big Turnout
Expected.
Preparations are well under way by tne
wheelmen of this City for a novel and pic
turesque street spectacle. It will be a
lantern parade of bicyclists, to take place
on the night of Saturday, the 25th inst. A
big turnout is confidently anticipated.
Pleas for good roads and the new City
charter will be made by distinguished
orators. Prizes are to be awarded for the
best decorated machines â single and tan
dem â the handsomest uniform and a pen
nant to tbe club with the greatest number
of riders in line.
At last evening' 3 session of the San
Francisco Cycle Board of Trade it was re
ported by the parade committee fiat the
route of the procession had not yet been
determined, aod that the question of the
decoration of the buildings along the line
of the run would be discussed at a meet
ing of bicyclists with improvement clubs
to-night.
The names of Messrs. Samuel M. Short
ridge, James D. Phelan, George A. Knight
and James 11. Barry were suggested in the
list of desirable speakers, if their services
could r>e :-ecured.
It was voted to instruct the secretary to
send an official notification of the lantern
parade to the various bicycle clubs of the
City and invite them to send representa
tives to the next session of the board,
which will be held Wednesday evenine,
the 15th inst., at the Rambler establish
ment, corner of Tenth and Market streets.
The teamsters and draymen, it was
stated, after conferring with a committee
of the board had promised to co-operate
with the wheelmen in their movement for
good roads and street improvements.
An invitation to riders to take an early
run to the Sutro Baths was received and
accepted. The lighting of Golden Gate
Park and the construction there as soon
as practicable of a bicycle track, also the
repaying of Market street, were topics re
ceiving only a passing mention, since the
committee, while alive to their import
ance, bad nothing new at the moment
to report.
PaÂ«Â«ed Bogus Coin.
Alexander Wilson was arrested Wednesday
afternoon and lodged in the City Prison,
charged with passing counterfeit coin, Daniel
A. Seferles. a restaurant keeper at 1069 Market
street, being the complaining witness. Yester
day Secret Service Agent Harris took charge of
the prisoner, and will prosecute the case in
the United States courts. Wilson tendered a
lead $5 piece to the restaurant keeper, and,
receiving the proper change, departed.
Seferles discovered the imposition and kept a
lookout for the man. Wednesday he passed
the restaurant and Seferles immediately had
him arrested. The accused man. will be given
a preliminary hearing before Commissioner
HeacocK to-day.

GIVE NO QUARTER,
J. H. Tibbets Writes ofi
Slaughter in Mata
beleland.
SUPPRESSING THE NEWS
Many Californians Murdered by
the Treacherous Sav
ages.
ALL MINING NOW SUSPENDED.
The Plague Attacked the Cattle and
All Baggage Has to Be Moved
on Donkeys.
Those of this State, and there are many,
â who contemplate poing to the mining dis
tricts of South Africa, had better consult
with those who have had recent expe
rience in that part of the Dark Continent.
That country does not glitter with gold
and diamonds which may be obtained like
gathering pebbles from a beach. While
there is plenty of precious metal there it
is worth a man's life to secure it.
Such, briefly, is the statement of one of
California's well-known citizens who is
now in that far-off land and who wishes
.he was bacfc in this Â£tate again.
Last October J. H. Tibbets, a mining
man of Amador County and of this City,
went to South Africa. It will be remem
bered that Mr. Tibbets was once a State
Senator. He recently wrote a letter to a
friend, a well-known mmmâ¢ man on Pine
street, from Buluwayo, in Matabeleland.
In this letter he tells of several San
Francisco people who were slaughtered in
the native uprising and of his own escape
from a similar Sate. The horror of tne
situation, Mr. Tibbets says, has never
been made known to the world, as the
English corporation, whose franchises
cover that section of the country, does not
want its business damaged.
Besides the horrors of savage warfare
there are cattle plague, scarcity of food and
a general stagnation of mining interests.
His letter in part reads as follows:
We have had nothing but war since I arrived
here. The Matabele uprising is horrible, 300
to 400 whites having been murdered in the
various districts. Tne outside world don't
know how serious it has been. The Charter
Company will not let any papers go out, and it
doctors all of the news sent out by wire. Sev
eral Americans I met here have been mur
dered. A. R. Hammond, an old Pine-street
man, who has a daughter in Los Angeles, was
murdered while coming from one of his mines,
thirty-five miles from here.
Bob White and O. Palmer, both mining en
gineers from California, were murdered on the
road. Old Tom Madocks of Nevada w&s one of
the first killed by the rebel natives. I was in
the ijwanda district at the time of the up
risiug. thirty miles from the rebel stronghold, j
We numbered forty whites. A laager (log fort) |
was made. I did not like it and did not go
into it. I had lour good horses and three good
men with me, and we stayed on the outside.
My people in Buluwayo got uneasy about us
and sent a dispatcher to us informing all to '
move to Fort Tuli, eighty miles down the road.
We got there very quickly.
The next day 200 mounted men were sent to
our rescue from Buluwnyo. The commis
sioner fearea the dispatches did not get
through, but we had gone when the rescue
party arrived. The latter on its return had to
light very hard, and In the scrimmage lost six
men end fifteen wounded. I remained in Fort
Tuli six weeks. The forts are every six miles
apart along the principal roads. Several com
panies are out, and fighting is going on every
day.
Just before the outbreak a cattle plague
came into the country and thousands of cattle
died.
Hundreds of wagons are on the road with
transports and no bullocks. Transport is now
coming in on donkeys and mules. Board has
I increased 75 per cent and drinks 50 per cent.
\ The outside world does not know of the situ
ation here. It is true the Charter Company
Is doing its best to relieve the distress, but It
don't want any discouraging news sent
abroad. There will be no mining done here
for a year.
LEPERS STILL WAITING.
Sixteen Unfortunates With but
One Ray of Hope for
Them.
Watching for Dr. Goto's Remedy,
Which the Customs Authorities
Will Not Give Up.
In the foothills at the base of Twin
Peaks, among nodding and bending tall
eucalyptus trees, is the ramshackle home
of the lepers.
The place is lonely in the wide expanse
of dreary waste surrounding it and a high
board fence shuts out the world.
The lepers are morally, if not physically,
sensitive. A finger or ear might be
twisted off and not give them pain, but
they do not care to be gazed at.
"Old Chinese Annie," as she is called,
the only woman in the settlement, hideous
to an extreme from the ravages of the
dread disease, greeted her visitors yester
day with a coarse lau K h. It was painful
r.ot only to look at her but to hear ber
croaking tones.
"I don't want to have my picture in the
paper*," she asserted. "It don't do me
any good and they make fun of me."
The woman, although but 3(J years of
age, might be twice thai, judging from
her bloated and scaly face and limbs.
The fence around the Pesthouse is only
to keep strangers without. The lepers
themselves appear contented enough to
remain within, where they care for eacli
other, are comfortably bedded end well
fed. They would i;Ot leave their errew
sorae home to mingle with a world that
would spurn them in disgust. They sim
ply lie about, eat. Bleep and drink and j
wait for death to put them out of their
misery.
1 here are sixteen patients, and the only
ray of hope they have had in years came
to them a short while ago, when Super
visor Benjamin procured Dr. Goto's rem
edy for leprosy.
Will it cure them?" Superintendent J.
P. Keatintr, who has charge of the unfor
tunate sixteen, said. "I cannot answer
that. What I do know is that the poor
fellows are happier now than they have
wen in a long while. They have some
thing to hope for, something to think
al 'out, and that is a great deal."
Superintendent Keating expected that
'ye remedy would reach him yesterday
afternoon from the Custom-houae, but it
did not. As soon as it does he will imme
diately commence administering it to his
wards.
The remedy consists of little pills the
size of barley and of a tea. One of the
lepers has a box of the pills which was
sent to him by a friend some weeks ago,
and he takes a teaspoonful of these pills
every day. The tea, however, he has not
yet been able to obtain. He fancies that
there is a slight improvement in his con
dition, but the Superintendent fails to
notice it.

SUPERVISORS SUMMONED
They Must Tell Judge Seawell
All About the Folsom-
Street Contract.
The Jordan Bituminous Rock Company
Claims It Was Discriminated
Against.
Judge Slack yesterday issued a writ of |
certiorari commmanding the Board of j
Supervisors of San Francisco to appear j
before Jud,e Seawell on July 31 in order j
that their action in awarding the Folsom- I
street paving contract to the City Im- '
provement Company may be reviewed.
This is simply a new phase of an old
matter. The Jordan Bituminous Rock
and Paving Company entered a bid with
the board for the paving of Fo!?om street,
when the contract was awarded to the City
Improvement , Company. The . Jordan
company claims that it was discriminated
against in the matter, by means of pecu
liar specifications, which prevented it
using its bitumen, because it is brought
to this city in sea-goinn vessels instead of
on the cars of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and because it uses open instead of
closed Kettles, such as are used by other
contractors.
A further claim is made that the action
of the board in awarding the contract was
illegal, because the proceedings leading
up to it were void, inasmuch as the speci
fications adopted were twice vetoed by the
Mayor and not since passed upon by the j
Supervisors. . , .- â  ,
The Jordan company, some time ! ago
prayed for a writ of prohibition prevent
ing Auditor Brodenck from passing a
warrant for $20,000 in favor or the City
Improvement Company, on account of the
work already done on Folsom : street, and
the same company has caused the writ of
certiorari to be issued by Judge Slack.

The letter-carriers' picnic at Schuetzen
Park to-morrow will be a feature 'ot the
National holiday, and will no doubt at
tract a big crowd. The receipts are to be
devoted to the sick and death benefit fund
of the Letter-carriers' Association.
This association was organized in this
City, January 20, 1888, the objects being
mutual benefit â especially to furnisi aid
to members when rendered incapable by
sickness of protecting and providing for
themselves, to encourage the spirit of
union and brotherly love among its mem
bers.
The association is incorporated under
the laws of the State of California, and
haÃ a membership of 160 carriers, almost
the entire letter-carrier force of this City.
The relief fund has been greater than re
ceipts from tnis source, nnd to mate up
this deficiency is the purpose of the an
nual picnic. The committee of arrange
ments is .composed of the following-named
carriers: G. W. Spiller (chairman), R. M.
Roche, R. H. Morse, James H. Smith, H.
M. Locke, J. J. Brown, I). T. Dougherty,
R. Donovan and L. Russel, who have
worked bard in providing for the enjoy
ment of the picnickers.
Three hundred gate and game prizes
will be ortered, many of which are of value
and utility. The list comprizes stoves,
sewing-machines, articles of every-day
household use, jewelry, etc. The music
wiil be fnrni-hed by the famous San Fran
cisco Letter-carriers' band of thirty .pieces.
This band was organized January 1, 1894, |
by I. C. Levey and W. Inwood, appointed !
at that time as a committee of two by the |
Letter-carriers' Mutual Aid Association, i
The band is a distinguishing feature cf the
association and is a great success. Follow
ing are the officers of tlie band: Presi
dent, D. T. Dougherty; vice-president, J.
S. Bullivan; secretary an* manager, I. C.
Levey; treasurer, P. J. Whelan; librarian]
H. de Landresse; leader, Herman Schafer;
instructor, Professor L. yon der Mehden;
directorsâ B. F. Ames, L. Nunan, C. de la
Fontaine.
Boats will leave the S. F. and N. P.
Company's slip at 9 and 11 a. m.. 12:35,
1:50 and 3:30 p. m. for the accommodation
of those desirous of attending the picnic.
The last train return in k to the City will
leave the park at 6:30 p. m. A diversity of
amusement has been provided for the j
day, including games, jumping, races,
sports of all kinds, muaic and dancing.
With this attractive programme, the
popularity of the carriers and the patriot
ism of the day it is certain that Schuetzen
Park will be crowded by the very best
people from San Francisco.
A MUCH MIXED CASE.
Mining Stock That Has Pasned Through
Many Hands Sued For.
Charles Ashton and Julius Jacobs, ex
ecutors of the will of Solomon 0. Heyden
felat, have sued Charles J. Heggerty, Sun
shine O. Heydenfeldt, Elizaoeth A. Hey
denfeldt and the Zeila Mining Company
for the return of 4674.64 shares of Zeila
mining stock which was ieft by the will of
Solomon Heydenfelat to his wife Elizabeth
Heydenfeldt.
After the stock was transferred to Mrs.
Heydenfeldt the Supreme Court decided
that it was subject to claim as part of the
estate of the deceased, he owing $40,000 on
a mortgage.
The executors have brought suit against
its present possessors to recover the stock,
in order that it may be used to satisfy the
mortgage.
O'DONNELL OWES RENT.
The Perennial Candidate Sued for the
Hire of Hi* Office.
Dr. C. C. o'Donnell has for tome time
dropped out of sight, but yesterday
he bobbed up again, and in a way that is
undoubtedly little to his liking. He waa
sued for four months' rent of his offices at
Kearny and Wasbington^streets.
It has been a popular supposition that
the "people's perennial candidate" was a
man of considerable means, and the fact
that he is unable to settle a bill of $40 per
month will come in the nature of a shock
to his friends.
The complaint was filed by Henrietta
Roullet, et al., owners of the property, suit
being brought for four months' rent from
March 1.
ii. W. o'Donnell is also named as a de
fendant in the action.
UNDER A FLORAL CANOPY

residence of the bride's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. George Burkhardt, 220 Thirteenth

Simplicity, combined with rare good
taste, wero the characteristic details of the
wedding. Choice blossoms were used to
decorate the drawing-room* of the resi
dence, and in the apartment where the
ceremony was performed an immense in
verted Japanese umbrella completely hid
den beneath a trellis of roses and ever
greens formed a canouy under which
the young couple stood while the ttev.
J. M. Buehler read the impressive Luth

The bride was attended by her sister,
Miss Amelia Burkhardt, who officiated as
maid of honor, and Miss Dora Westphal,
who acted as bridesmaid. Henry Colora
bat was best man and Edward Burkhardt,
groomsman.
The uride, a stately and attractive
blonde, was attired in a* modish traveling
gown of silver blue silk, elaborately
trimmed with lace and jeweled trimming.
The maid of honor wore a dainty gown of
delicate gray silk and the bridesmaid was
prettily attired in a pale Dlue silk gown.
After the ceremony an elaborate' bridal
supper was served. Mr. and Mrs. Ledeme
will leave this morning on a bridal trip to
Del Monte, and on their return will go to
housekeeping at 11 Adair. The happy
younix people received many beautiful and

HALF A MILLION
FOR UNCLE SAM,
Special Taxpayers Crowd
the Internal Revenue
Office.
THIRTY DAYS OF WORK
What It Costs Dealers to Sell
Wine, Beer and Whisky to
the Public.
RIGHTS OF BESTATJRATEURS.
Not Permitted by the Government to
Give Away Any Kind of Lquor
to Customers.
Hundreds of special taxpayers crowded
the office of the Internal Revenue Col
lector yesterday. There are thousands
yet to come, so it is probable that the next
thirty days will witness a continual stream
of men and women anxious to pour the
golden shekels into Uncle Sam's de
pleted treasury. In consequence of this
heavy rush. Collector Welburn and Chief
Deputy Loup are up to their necks in busi
ness.
For the fiscal year ending July 1, 1895,
there were enrolled on the revenue books
of this City 10,600 special taxpayers. It is I
thought that these figures will be swelled !
at least 500 when the books are closed :
July 31. Of the number already recorded, ]
9700 are retail and 390 wholesale liquor
dealers. In addition to this there are 150 j
retail dealers in malt liquors and 100 j
wholesalers. The following are the special i
taxes now imposed by law:
Rectifiers of less than 500 barrels... $100 00 â 
Rectifiers of 600 barrels or more 200 00 i
Dealers, retail liquor 25 00 :
Dealers, wholesale liquor 100 00 ;
Dealers in milt liquors, wholesale 50 00 i
Healers in malt liquors, retail 20 00 i
Keta'.l dealers in oleomargarine 48 00 i
Wholesale dealers in oleomargarine 480 00 â 
Manufacturers of oleomargarine 600 00 ;
Manufacturers of stills... 60 00 j
and for each still manufactured 20 00 |
and for each worm manufactured. 20 UO i
Brewers of lens than 6 00 barrels f>O*JO '
Brewers of 500 barrels or more 100 00 I
In restaurants where wine or beer is
given away with meals the retail liquor
dealer's tax of $2j is imposed. Every per
son liable to special tax upon commenc
ing Dusiness and again at the beginning of
each special-tax year must fiie with the
collector or deputy collector a sworn re
turn on this form, and pay to the Col
lector of Internal Revenue the amount of
the tax. For failure to make the return
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is
required by law to assess a penalty of 50
percent of the amount of the tax. The
failure to procure a special-tax stamp also
renders the delinquent liable to criminal
prosecution.
At the end of the thirty days allowed
the special taxpayers in which to make
their returns, Collector Welburn, through
his deputies, makes a canvass of every
house and store in his district. In this
way the Government comes very near get
ting every cent due. Those who have at
tempted to beat the law, and there are
always a few, are shown little or no con
sideration. They must pay the 50 per cent
fine, as already told, and in addition run
the risk of criminal prosecution. Chief
Deputy Loun says, however, that under
Mr. 'Welburn the number of people who
endeavor to evade taxation is growing less
each year.
It is expected that about $405,000 will be
collected this year. Of tbis forty rectifi
ers, who turn out more than 500 barrels
annually, pay JfcOOO, while the 100 who
keep under 500 barrels escape with a taxa
tion of $10,000. The heaviest special tax
imposed by law is on manufacturers of
oleomargarine. There is not at the pres
ent time, however, a single factory in
operation in the State.
It is not generally known that special
tax stamps are not transferable from one
dealer to another. When a new member
is added to a firm paying special tax a new
stamp is required. When two persons,
each holding a stamp for business, form a
partnership the firm must pay special tax.
In addition to- the special-tax payers
now crowding to Internal Revenue Office
there are scores of cigar manufacturers
filing new bonds. Collector Welbnrn made
a ruling some weeks asro that no more
stamps would be issued after July 1 unless
bonds were filed.

WEDDED NEAR THE
COLLEGE WALLS.
Leland Stanford Lathrop and
Miss Watson Quietly
Married.
AN EVENT IN BERKELEY
Illness of the Bride's Mother
Prevented Any Dis
play.
BOTH PARTIES WELL KNOWN.
Bride and Groom Started At Once for
Their Honeymoon in South
ern California.
BERKELEY, Cal.. July 2.â One Of the
most notable, and et the same time one
of the most quiet and unostentatious,
weddings that was ever held in the uni
versity town took place this afternoon at
the Goodrich residence on Dwight way, |
Miss Lillian Marion Watson and Leland Stanford Lathrop.
Leland Stanford Lathrop and Miss Lillian
Marion Watson having been the con
tracting parties.
The usual pomp and splendor at
tendant with weddings in high social
life was absent, largely on account of
the illness of the bride's mother. Only
the nearest relatives of the bride and
groom were present; they numbered in
all about twelve persons.
The Episcopal ceremony which made the
pair busband and wife was rendered by
Dr. E. B. Spaulding of Trinity School.
Miss Rowena Watson, only sister of the
bride, acted as bridesmaid, and Frank Van
Ness of San Francisco served as best man.
The bride was attired in a plain travel
ing dress, while the bridesmaid was at
tired in a finely wrought gown of mousseiin
de soie.
The presents received were numerous
and elegant. It was expected that Mrs.
Leland Stanford would be present, but on
account of illness she was prevented from
so doing.
Amid a shower of rice the happy couple
was driveu to the local train, by which
they left for Southern California on their
honeymoon.
They will spend most of the time while
in the South at Santa Barbara, after which
they will return to San Francisco, where
they will make their home.
TART RESOLUTIONS.
Women Object to Rerent ('iterances
Hade by J. Richard
Freud.
The following resolutions have been
adopted by the American Women's
Liberal League:
Whereas, J. Richard Freud in his reply to
the American Women's Liberal League insinu
ates that said women use unfair tactics; and,
whereas, there are no tactics more unfair than
suppression of the truth and suggestion of the
false; and, whereas, J. Richard Frued states
that "the new charier opens the portals" to
women to serve upon the School Board; and
whereas, the law already in force, to wit-
Part 111, title itii, chapter 3, article VI, section
1593, of the Political Code, provides "that no
person shall be deemed ineligible to the office
of trustee on account of sex" ; and. whereas, we
do no! need to ''open the portalb" to any loyal
citizen, nor to close the portals to any oth^r
loyal citizen ; and, whereas, J. Richard Freud
states that the new charter provides
that "it shall be the duty of the
Superintendent of Schools to see that no
religion* or MetasUn books or teachings are
allowed in the schools"; and whereas the very
came provision is now in force by virtue
of out present laws; and whe*reaÂ» J
Richard Freud stated that the provis^
ion of the charter excluding from the
public schools all teachers except those who
have been educated in the public school sys
tem of California is based upon the most patri
otic motives, because in the first plaoethei*
are only 680 places in our scho >!s and there
are 1381 pupils in our Normal schools, and be
cause, in the second place, Eastern
and foreign-born teachers with pulls have
forced graduates of tlie University of Cali
fornia into menial positions; and where
as, It is untrue to say that these 1381
pupils are looking for (he (>BO places in the
City and County oi Kan Francisco, since every
school from Sukiyou to Ban Diego is open
to them; and whereas, there is no more
reason why the municipality should provide
johx for the graduates of the Normal schools
than that It should provide jobs ior the book
keepers, stenographers, typewriters, me
chanics blacksmiths or carpenters, who have
graduated from the other schools; and whereas
it is untrue that our department is flooded"
with Eastern and foreign teachers; and
whereas, it is an outrage that the Merchants'
Association of this City, m.-my of whose mem
bers are patronized by the present teachers,
should permit its secretary to insult the noble
able and self-sacrificing women who hold po
sitions in our School Department by spying
that they hold their positions neither by merit,
ability nor capacity ; and whereas, the' section
of the charter which J. Richard Freud advo
cates makes it impossible- for any one who
has ever attended a private school
even for the shortest period to become a
teacher in the pubic schools; and whereas
this provision was introduced by the A. P. A
in order to destroy, if possible, t'lve parochial i
schools of a certain church by punishing all
who might have hud at f.ny time attended
those schools; and whereat, "the provisions of
the charter are determined not by the inten
tions of the lramers. but by the letter of the
charter; and whereas, according to J. Richard
Freud's own coniession, the machinery for
amending the charter is so cumbrous and
complicated that the instrument is almost in
capable of amendment; now, therefore be it
Resolved, That we condemn, reject and re
pudiate the tactics of J. Richard Freud in sup
pressing the truth: (1) by concealing the lact
that almost every good and desirable feature
of the new charter is contained In our present
laws; (2) by concealing the fact that it is un
constitutional to deny the citizens of each
State all privileges and immunities ot citizens
in the several States (Art. IV Sec. 2); (3) by
concealing tne fact that the clause in question
is so worded that no person who has ever at
tended any other school but a public school
can be a teacher in our public schools, for
which these persons pay taxes; (4) by con
cealing the fact that this provision is an A. P.
A. provision, inserted for the purpose of in
juring people of a certain religious denomina
tion; (5) by concealing the fact that this
charter is supported by the united strength of
the a. P. A. solely and entirely on account of
this provision; (G) by concealing the fact that
the Merchants' Anoctatlon and J. Richard
Kreud are wittingly or unwittingly doing the
dirty work of tne A." P. A.; ana be It further
Resolved, That we loathe, detest and abhor
the tactics of J. Richard Freud In suggesting
falsehood: (1) By insinuating that all the
teachers in the School Department of SÂ»n
Francisco have obtained their positions by un
due influence and on grounds other than
merit, ability and capacity; (2) by stating that
the 1381 puplis of the Normal schools have no
other chance of practicing their calling than
by getting some of the CSO places in the City
of San Francisco; (3) by hinting that the
School Department of this City is over
run with Eastern or foreign teachers;
(4) by suggesting that the young men
and women of California who aspire
to be teachers are not able to take care of
themselves without special protection; (5)
by stating that the framers of the charter were
men of liberal ideas, when we know that many
of them were owned body and soul by the
A. P. A. ; and be it further
Kan red. That we call on the members of the
Merchants' Association to inform us what
object they have in advocating this barbarous,
retrograde, illiberal, unjust and bigoted sec
tion; and be it further
Resolved. That we call on each ana every one
of the 10.000 American women who have
signed our roll to use their personal influence
with tue members of the Merchants' Associa
tion to fir.d out what influence is at work to
make these gentlemen support a provision
aimed at the adherents o! a certain creed, and
be it further
Resolved, That we postpone the consideration
oi the other provisions of the charier until our
next meeting.
McCLATCHY'S CONVICTION
It Has Been Taken Up by the

day night, the following officers being
elected :
Hon. James G Magutre, president; Herman

The organization had been slumbering
! for some time, but awakened when Editor
Charles K. McClatchy was recently sub
jected to arbitrary conviction at the hands
of the court he was alleged to have scored.
In this case the court acted as accuser,
jury and executioner. Following are the
i resolutions adopted :
Whereas, Charles K. McClatchy, editor of
I the Sacramento Bee. on June 5 of this year
! was brought before Superior Judge Callin,
: whom he had offended by criticism, and, after
being denied his inalienable right to be heard
; in his own defense, in accordance with the
â¢ constitution and the statutory laws, wns fined
$500, with the alternative ol serving 250 days
' in the County Jail; and whereas, the Legisla
ture of this State in.1891, by an almost unani
mous vote in response to an equally unani
i mous public sentiment, passed what is known
as the Barry law, which law reads as, follow*:
No speech, statement or publication reflect
ing upon any court or any officer thereof shall
j be treated or punished its a contempt of such
I court unless made in the immediate presence
of such court .while in session, and in such a
manner as to interfere with its proceedings.
Whereas, Judge Catlin has declared that he
â¢ is superior to Hie jaw-making power and iohis
: creators and that the above law is unconstitu
| tional; therefore, be it â¢ ,
Beta Md, That the act of Judge Catlin Is in
utter defiance of law and equity and of the
fundamental principles on which this Govern
ment was founded ; and be it further
Resolved, That the act of Congress of March
31, 1831, passed for the purpose of preventing
the Judges of the United States courts from
ever denying a jury trial for words spoken or
written, out of court, concerning a Judgeâ
and which act is practically the fame as the
law passed by the Legislature in 1891â should
be adopted at the next session of tne Legisla
ture, and be submitted to the people as a con
stitutional amendment; and be it also
Resolved, That the California Free Press De

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY S, lÂ»yÂ«
SEAVER'S STORY
SOMEWHAT SHAKEN
Attorney Dunne Conducts a
Rigid Cross-Examina
tion.
THE WITNESS IS FRANK
Admits That He Has Done Noth
ing on the Square Since
1894
HOW HE SAW THE PRIZE-FIGHT
While Walking Past the Pavilion
With an Officer They Were In
vited In.
The cross-examination of witness Seaver
or Dean consumed most of the time in the
trial of Creejran and Becker yesterday in
Judge Wallace's court. The conclusion
of his direct testimony was given in the
same easy and unembarrassed manner as
his story on Wednesday. The exception
ally strong and piercing cross-examina
tion of Attorney Dunne failed to confuse
the witness, although it made him con
tradict in some details the testimony he
had given in the McCloskey trial.
Attorney Wilson continued his examina
tion of Seaver in the morning. Seaver
had made an agreement with Creegan that
the latter and Charles Becfcer should each
receive one-fourth of the $20,000, i. c.
$5000 apiece. After McCloskey and Seaver
divided the money Seaver did not see
Creegan until several weeks later, when
he met him in New York. When Seaver
had left this City on the afternoon of
December 19, 1895, he traveled under the
name of S. C. Jones. The witness here
identified the overland railroad ticket on
which he had traveled East. Seaver was
arrested in the St. Paul National Bank in
Minnesota. McCloskey was arrested
about the same time in Minneapolis, and
both were brought back to this City about
March 11 by Detectives Seymour and
Whittaker.
Attorney Wilson went back again to the
forged check. Before he came out from
New York Seaver had procured various
samples of bank paper and h?d given them
to Creegan to be used by Becker. Seaver
again examined the forged draft and swore
that the perforated figures changing the
draft from $12 to $22,000 had been made
between the time he gave the original
check to Creegan to give to Becker and
the time when he received it again from
Creegan.
The statement made by Seaver to Cap
tain Lees on the morning alter he was
brought back to tLe City was substantially
the same as the story told by the witness
on the stand Tuesday and given at length
in yesterday's Call. While in this City
Seaver often slept at the Hammam Baths,
where he often met Talbot Clifton and
White Hat McCarthy. Seaver here men
tioned that his crooked career began with
bis arrest for having in his possession a
$50 counterfeit bill. After that he fell in
with various forgers and engaged in vari
ous jobs.
Seaver also identified a sample of Cree
gan's handwriting, with which he declared
he was familiar. A memorandum of ex
tracts from the Bankers' Almanac, with a
list of various suitable banks in Minnesota
and Dakota doing business with the St.
Paul and Minneapolis banks, was offered
in evidence as a specimen of Creegan's
handwriting in spite of Attorney Dunne's
objection.
Attorney Dunne began the cross exami
nation of the witness with some questions
about Seaver's statement made to Captain
Lees, and introduced a copy of it which
had been sworn to before a deputy clerk
and forwarded to New York. Then the
attorney for the defense began his attack
upon the witness' testimony. Seaver ad
mitted that he had no legitimate occu
pation and had done nothing 'on the
square' since 1894. He had been convicted
ot jelony three times, once for forgery and
twice for counterfeiting. deaver is at
present under indictment for ;orgery. but
althongh;he was indicted before Creegan
and Becker, his trial has been postponed.
He said he wanted McCloskey's trial to be
completed Brat. Since his arrest he has
not been actually confined in a cell. Al
though not admitted to bail, he has been
allowed to go to various places in this
City, the park, Cliff House, restaurants,
telegraph offices and elsewhere. He had
also witnessed the prize-fight at the Pa
vilion.
Seaver corroborated in general the de
tails of his direct testimony. Attorney
Dunne pressed him particularly with
reference to his intimacy with McCloskey.
Seaver and McCloskey were together
nearly every day, dining together at the
"Pup and the "Zinkand."
At the opening of the afternoon session
Attorney Dunne questioned the witness in
regard to the raised draft. He gave as his
opinion, after having examined the draft
through a class, that it was a very expert
piece of workmanship. The photographic
copy, which Captain Lees had shown him,
disclosed imperfections in the work, and
judging from this only, Seaver had ex
pressed the opinion that it was a bungline
joo. B s
Seaver's account of his actions on the
morning when he drew the $20,000 contra
dicted the testimony of Cashier Grant
Seaver denied that McCloskey or any one
else had entered the bank with him or had
suggested that he take the money in gold
or had gone out with him. Before going
into the bank he had gone into a saloon
with McCloskey.
After taking the money to the buggy,
driving to the Mission and returning to
town, as Seaver recounted in his testimony
on Wednesday, he ami McCloskey divided
the money and McCloskey went out for
two or three hours. Meanwhile, Seaver
shaved and packed his belongings, in- !
eluding some $4000, in a valise and $5000
in a parcel. When Seaver left tbe room
he left McCloskey in charge of the money.
In is account ot the transaction differed
radically from the statement mnde to Cap- 1
tain Lees, in which it was said thnt the i
division of money wns made at the Bald
win Hotel, and with Creopan. not McClos
key. Weaver explained this by saying that
at the time he signed the affidavit for Lees
he had not read it through. He had
originally told Lees that he had divided
the money with a man whose name he '
oid not give, at a hotel near Market street
and later Lees had substituted Creegan's
name and the Buldwin Hotel without pro
test from Seaver, who did not at that time
wish it to be known where be had staved
with a statement that be had seen 'Mc-
Closkey several times during the past

here with Seaver's wife, the cross-exami
nation concluded.
On his redirect examination Seaver ex
plained some of the answers he had made
to Attorney Dunne. His visit lothe prize
light had been accidental; he bwd gone
out to supper with an officer, and as they
returned another officer at the Pavilion
invited them in. At the fipht, ns at all
times, be was accompanied by an officer
Ihe permission that He had been given to
stay in the detectives' office instead of
being imprisoned in a cell was given be
cause he had been sick with malaria and
there was a grate fire in the detectives'
100 m.
"\Vilcy G. Lytle, the office-boy employed
by Dean to drive his bnggy, recounted the
incidents of the morning'of December 18
m substantially the same manner as told
by Seaver.
After parting with Dean Lytle got em
ployment with the Pinherton Detective
Agency througn Captain Lees and is now
Â«Â°!? ?7 ed by the captain. He had identi
fied McCloskey at St Paul, having seen
photographs and newspaper pictures of
nim. The witness denied that there was
any great resemblance in these pictures to
a man who came into Dean's office on the
morning of December 18. Although he
was not certain at the McCloskey trial
p, , tne ffis n might not have been Mc
closkey, Lytle was quite positive yester
day that it was not.
Detective John F. Seymour, one of the
ofneers who had brought Cree<?an and
Becker back to California from St. Paul,
testified that Becker had told him that he
had never been in this Ci<y, but had re
fused to discuss the case further.
At the conclusion of Detective Sey
mour s testimony the trial was continued
until next Monday mornin? at 10 o'clock.

PREPARING NEW MAPS,
The Development Committee
Nearly Ready to Issue
Them.
Headquarters May B. Established in
Chicago â Excursions From
the East.
A meeting of the San Francisco branch
of the State Development Committee was
held yesterday. There were present: W.
M. Bunker, David Rich, Frank A. Vail, f.
J. Truman, Wendell Easton, Hugh Craig,
W. P. Buckingham. Evan J. Coleman,
Herman Bendel, A. B. Maguire ana D. M.
Carman. Mr. Bunker gave an outline of
the work done by the State committee
since the dose of the Atlanta exposition
and now under way. He called for nom
inations for chairman and Herman Bendel
was elected by acclamation.
It was decided to have published an
edition of 300,000 of the toposraphical
State maps containing a birdseye view of
San Francisco as it is and as it looked in
1849, and an article on its commercial
importance and other advantages, illus
trated with half-tone cuts of prominent
buildings, points of interest, etc. To raise
funds for that purpose it was decided to
make a systematic canvass of the City.
Mr. Rich offered the following resolu
tion, which was adopted:
Resolved, That the following circular letter
to the public ol San Francisco be prepared and
signed by all the members of the committee
and thai copies of the same be lurnished the
San Francisco daily papers:
To the. San Francisco J*ublir; The undersigned
representing the Interests of San Francisco on the
California State Development Committee, have
taken up the work believing that by united and
systematic action much can be accomplished in
the wav of developing the resources of the state,
finding new markets for its products, stimulating
Its manufacturing industries and Increasing its
trade. By this means we hope to cause a revival
of business In our own City, and as the first means
to thai end we are endeavoring to have published
and distributed in the East 300.000 topographical
and climatic maps of the Â»tate, containing a birds
eye view of the City, with an illustrated article on
the commercial and natural advantages of San
Francisco.
These maps are being published at an exceed-
Ingly low cn-,t, and we appeal to the public to aid
In this patriotic work by snbirnbing for them a- 6
cents each, the committee guaranteeing to see
them judiciously and Kysteinaticaily distributed.

On motion the chairman was instructed
to appoint three members, to constitute
the executive committee, with full power
to act.
The committee discussed at some length
the establishing of permanent headquar
ters at Chicago, where a display of Califor
nia products could be exhibited, literature
distributed and a continual series of stere
opticon views given.
Mr. Bunker said that although there is a
fine exhibit in this City, it did not reach
the class of people whom the committee is
desirous of interesting, those who have
never been out here, and to reach those an
exhibit must be made in the East.
Wendell Easton agreed that the best
work of the committee would be that done
east of the Rocky Mountains.
Mr. Easton, with other members of the
committee, favored running excursions of
tourists and home-seekers from Chicago
to this State under the auspices of the
committee, and thought it made little dif
ference in what part of the State they
landed, San Francisco would bÂ« sure to be
benefited by :he increased immigration
as well as from the tourist travel. It was
expressed as the sense of the meeting that
a series of excursions be inaugurated as
soon as headquarters in Chicago could be
opened.

WILL MOVE TO
A NEW LOCATION,
The Youths' Directory Has
Outgrown Its Present
Quarters.
TOO MANY INMATES.
A Big Home and Technical
School to Be Built in the
Suburbs.
PLANNING A GRAND FESTIVAL.
Money Will Be Raised by a Monster
Fair in the Mechanics'
Pavilion
For some time past the building of the
Youths' Directory at 2030 Howard street
has not been large enough to accommodate
the City's supply of homeless, desolate
The Youths' Directory Building, Which Has Become Too Small for the Waifs of
This City.
boys who need shelter within its walls.
On this account active preparations are
now in progress for a grand festival to be
held in the Mechanics' Pavilion in No
vember, tbe proceeds of which will be de
voted to purchasing a lot in Ihe outskirts
of the City. It is intended to erect a large
home on this lot, with technical schools
where the little waifs and strays can be
taught to become useful members of so
ciety.
The Youths' Directory, although it takes
in destitute children and orphans, has
never, during the ten years of its exist
ence, received a cent either of State or
county aid. Need is the great passport to
admission within its walls. Relieion and
nationality do not enter into the question.
Among the seventy three boys there at
present are two little swarthy skinned
Syrians, who*e parents found themselves
destitute here after the Midwinter Fair
and as for religion, about half tbe chil
dren there are registered as Protestants.
"It would De an inhuman and an un-
Christian thing to make any distinctions i
of religion in admitting these destitute '
boys," said Rev. Dennis Crowley, the I
president, when questioned yesterday on <
the subject. "The Youths' Directory is !
for cases of immediate needâ boys who are
picked up homeless in the streets, chil
dren whose parentÃdie suddenly and leave
Some of the Boys as They Have Entered the Youths' Directory.
them destitute, or who abandon them.
We never keep our waifs long. The rirst
aim of the Youths' Directory is to mase
the boys self-supporting. Those who are
old enough to work, and who have had a
fair education, go out to stores and fac
tories. The younger ones attend toe Mis
sion Grammar School till we can have
them adopted.* 1
Five hundred destitute boys pass every
year through the Youths' Directory. They
come in helpless, sent by the Society for
tbe Suppression of Vice, the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and
other organizations. They go out to peo
ple who will care for them, or to positions
where they will be given a start in the
world, and where they Know that they
can always go back to tne directory for
assistance, advice and sympathy. It is on
account of the transitory sojourn of the
children that the State give* no aid. They
do not remain long enough for a claim to
be put in for their support.
It is generally at the turning-point in
the boys' lives that (hey are sent to the
Youths' Directory. They are just on the
verge of vagrancy, homeless in many
cases and without frienas, or wifh friends
that they would be better without. The
directory at once becomes a home to
them; its doors are never locked; indeed,
from the playeround there is a gate that
leads to the street, but boys who have run
away from hall a dozen other institutions
stay here, and if they are sent on errands
to other parts of the City they come back
again as to a home.
The reason the boys give for this is that
they like being there and do not want to
run away. The fact is that they are ruled
by love, tempered, it is true, with firm
ness, but there is no fear. Just now it is
vacation and the boys are having a splen
did time. The studious boys are making
a run on the library and curl themselves
up in sunny nooks with the sort of books
that children love to read.
With all this family of seventy-three
boys, there are only three paid persons to
work in the home. The boys lay the
tables, sweep the airy dormitories* and
make the cozy while beds. When asked
whether it was not more trouble to teach
the boys how to do the work than to do it
one self, P'ather Crowley replied, laugh
ingly, "Well, perhaps it ip, but thinK how
good it is for the boys to learn to be
useful."
The Youths' Directory is in a sense self
supporting. Its chief income is derived
from the sale of a paper, St. Joseph's
Union, which Father Crowley euits.
Every three years, however, a grand festi
val is held, which is always attended by
thousands of people anxious to contribute
a mite by their presence toward the sup
port of so deserving an institution.
This year an especial festival is being
planned, which will take place in the Me
chanics' Pavilion in October. An effort
will be made to appeal to the public, irre
spective of religious convictions.
"I should like to make the taxpayers
see that it is to their interest to support
the directory," said Father Crowley.
"The Stato supports no institution for
homeless children. If the waifs are not
taken off the streets they will assuredly
[ drift into vice and probably to crime, then
! tney will De sent to the penitentiary and
j the taxpayers will have to support them.
j It is better, far better, to take them off the
j streets now and bring them up to be use
ful, self-supporting members of society."
The festival held three years ago was a
great success, but it is expected that the
coming one will far surpass it. There are
to be seventeen large booths, each pre
sided over by twelve to fifteen prominent
j ladies The boys will be in evidence as
squires to run the ladies' errands, and
they are already rehearsing choruses
which they will sing at the concerts whicd
are being planned in connection with the
festival.
A most enthusiastic meeting of the la
dies and gentlemen interested in the forth
! coming festival was held last evening in
the assembly hall of the Youths' Direct
ory, Howard street.

Whatever, the cause of these pains in the
back they are nerve pains. They mean that
the nerves are suffering, and a remedy which
will cure the nerves will remove the cause of
the pain. As electricity Is the life of the nerves
it is the only remedy that will cure them. This
explains the wonderful and exclusive success
of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt. Its full strength,
and it gives a volume of electricity into the
body, which saturates the system in three

where it enters the nerve centers and feeds
them.

colored flags, and its stores will loom up
gayly festooned with tri-colored buntings
and streamers. At night the main

THE PROHIBITION
COUNTY CONVENTION
Platform Adopted by the
Regular Organization of
the Party.
IT LETS MONEY ALONE.
The Ticket Will Be Nominated
by the New County Com
* mitteee.
SINGLE TAX DIFFERENCES.
Convention Fearful That a Financial
Plank Might Overshadow Pro
hibition.
Tho Prohibition party of San Francisco, in
convention assembled, mindful of our respon
sibility to God and our duty to our feilowmen,
declare as follows:
1. We stand for the total destruction of the
liquor truffle.
'J. We declare that women are entitled to
â¢ utlrage equally with men.
3. We favor the observance of one day in
seven as a day of rest.
4. We favor a reduction of the salaries of
public official*, the working force of official!
and the fee system.
5. We demand the rigid enforcement of laws
restricting the liquor traffic.
6. We favor a constitutional amendment giv
ing any political division in this State the
right to decide for itself under what system of
taxntion to collect the expenses of'govern
ment.
And the following subsidiary resolu
tions:
We favor the new city charter to be voted
on at the next election.
We favor the establishment and main
tenance of tree public baths lor the people of
San Francisco.
The above is the platform adopted last
niL-ht by the Prohibition party of San
Francisco in its regular County Convtn
\ lion held last night in a hall at 997 Market
I street. Sixteen men and two ladies were
I present, but that put not even the slightest
{ kind of a i.amper on theentnusiasm of the
convention.
After some debate the Prohibition party
decided to con.c out this yeur, as usual,
and show its colors in the autumn breeze.
Thougu its numbers at the convention
were not as larire as were expected a spec
tator would conclude, from tne vi or ot
the proceedings and the lire of the
speeches, that the party is more energetic
Hi an ever.
Samuel Fear, chairman of the County
â  Commit ie;\ was also elected chairman of
; the convention and Secretary F. Head its
secretary. Among the other prominent
i Prohibition leaders present were Joseph
j Rowell, N. Morcom, W. N. Jleserve, L.
I Hansen, C. B. Williums, John M. Jlartin,
Mis. C. B. Williams and Mrs. Ruse il.
; French.
The most spirited debate in the conven
tion was ou tne question of tbe adoption
of a financial plank. Two planks on the
qne*rion proposed for tne platform were
cum, Ât oil. One was to the effect that the
party favors the use of both gold and
silver as tho basis of currency, ana the
other was that the party is in fevor of the
money of the constitution â to the end that
it favored the free and unlimited coinage
of silver and gold at tbe ratio of lti to 1
without the consent of any other nation.
Tbe reason that these financial planks
were voted down was that the majority
thought that the money question might
overshadow the principal issueâprohibi
tion.
Plank six of the platform caused consid
erable discussion and disagreement, but it
was finally udoÂ»:eci by a majority of one
vote. Mrs. C. B. Williams so .ttrougly op
posed the singie-tax idea in relation to
this plank that she declined to serve ou
the county Committee.
The following were appointed as mem
bers of the new County Committee: C. B.
Williams, T. S. Harrison, Mr. Vance, L.
Hansen, Mrs. French, J. Rowell, E. B.
Stewart, >'. Morcoin, F. N. Pater, S. Fear,
L. K. McClellan, F. Heal, Mrs. E. J.
Spencer, John M. Martin and Mr. Helli
weil.
AÂ» the hour by this time was late it was
voted to leave the nomination of the
ticket to the new County Committee. It
will meet in a few days and make up the
ticket.
GOLDEN GATE CARNIVAL.
The Eoard of Trade Is the Latest
Organization to Help
It Along.
General Warfield Has Received a Let
ter From President A. A.
Watkins.
A. A. Watkins, president of the Board
of Traae, has written a letter to General
Warticid, president of the executive com
mittee of the Carnival of the Golden Gate,
accepting his invitation to meet with
other representative bodies at the Cham
ber of Commerce on Thursday afternoon,
July 2. Watkins speaks in the highest
terms of the benefits to be derived by the
City from the coming carnival, and prom
ises the hearty co-operation and assist
ance of the merchants in that association.
Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber
of Commerce, has accepted the invitation
to preside at the meeting. He is another
of tbe enthusiasts who are coming to the
aid of the executive committee in bring
ing tbe matter of the carnival before the
public.
Secretary Backus and assistants are
busily engaged in sending out invitations
to all the prominent representatives of all
the trades and business interests in Ban
Francisco, notifying them to be present
and make the meeting a grand success.
The other members of the committee are
also untiring in bringing the matter be
fore the public, by personal solicitation
and otherwise. There is a feeling per
vading tbe members of the executive com
mittee that with the two coming celebra
tions out of tne way carnival matters will
go ahead as they have never gone before.
A number of designs for competition for
the prize of $25 offered by the committee,
to be adopted as tbe insignia of the oar
nival, have been received at. headquarters.
Some very striking conceptions have been
produced, and it will be a difficult matter
for the committee to make their decision.

Pome weeks ago the G. A. R. posts of

of proper celebrations to commemorate
the event.
Last evening the Exempts held a pre
liminary meeting, President George T.

A SOCIALIST

The Gathering Disturbed the

PREPARING FOR THE FOURTH
The Local Section and Delegates From
Many Other Bodies Will Be
in the Parade.
The police have again undertaken to in
terfere with tbe socialists' open-air meet
ings on Seventh and Maricet streets. Last
night one of the speakers, William Costley,
was arrested and taken to the Southern
Police station, where he was charged with
obstructing the street. This interference
will be bitterly contested in the courts by
the socialists, and if they do not possess
sufficient money to maintain their rights
of free speech they -will appeal for assist
ance to the association organized for the
preservation of free speech and freedom of
the press.
The trouble came about in this way:
The socialists held ttiree open-air meet
ings last evening for the purpose of arous
ing interest in th^ir movement and in
their parade that will be held to-morrow.
Tbe first gathering was on the Mint steps
and George Aspden, Tueodore Lynch and
"William Costley were the speakers. A
Httie later the same speakers spoke on the
street in front of the Odd Fellows' build
ing. A police officer demanded that the
cro^rd disperse and that Costley, the
chairman, cease in his address.
Upon his refusing io do so he was ar
rested and taken to jail, but was at once
released on bail.
However, the meeting continued and
Lynch and Aspden took up Costley's re
marks. A second policeman demanded
that Aspden cease speaking. The officer
stated that the people in the Odd Fellows'
bnihling were disturbed by the^e meetings
and tiiat the "Salvation Army gatherings
had beca abandoned in consequence at
that point.
The socialists inquired at the Odd Fel
lows' Hall office and found that the officer
was correct so far as the complaint was
concerned. However, they do not con
sider that the Odd Fellows have control
over the public streets to the extent that
they can shut off all open-air meetings in
the vicinity of the building, even if they
have the police to back up their demands.
As stated, the point involved will be con
tested to the bitter end.
Pending a judicial decision the meeting
adjourned and met again on the Mint
steps, where the discourses lasted until
11:30 p. m.
The Socialist Labor Party i 3 completing
its arranirem nts for a very ambitious dis
play on the Fourth.
Their committee met last night and se
lected Â«ix aids to the chief marshal, H.
Sahiender. They also engaged a fife and
drum corps to head tbe column. Tbe tall
est men in the San Francisco section will
be color-bearers, and many of those repre
sented iv the ranks of tbe socialist so
cieties participating will be ladies.
Delegations vrill also be in line from
Oakland, Los Gatos and San Jose, and
letters have been received from Sacra
mento and Los Angrles Mating that they
would be represented in the line of march
by comrades.
About 800 people were present at the
meeting on Wednesday night of Liberty
Brancb, Socialist Labor party, in the
Turk-street Temple to hear a lecture by
John 11. Reynolds. His subject was "The
Forces That Work for Socialism." The
meeting opened with a reading from the
People, (lie socialist National or^an, by
Theodore Lynch. Reynolds followed in
a very interesting address in which he re
viewed the different moral and economic
forces that are advancing and promoting
the socialist movement throughout tne
world. The speaker quoted from a recent
publication called "Catholic Socialism."
This little diversion from the usual me
lange of socialist lectures ruffled the war
feathers of one of Ingersoll's adherents.who
claimed that the church had deviated
from tne traditions of the gentle Naza
rene. A rejoinder followed to the pro
tests of the skeptic by Rev. J. E. Scott,
who was in the body of the hall. The doc
tor poured oil upon the troubled sea by
reading an article written by a minister
in support of socialism.
Short speeches in favor of the principles
of socialism followed by Mr. Simpson,
Mrs. Squires, Leo Gasser, P. Ross Martin,
George Aspden and Theodore Lynch.
At the close of the meeting quite a num
ber of persons joined the party.

rrw YORK, N. V.. Ji ly There ' Was a
â harp change in the temper of speculation at the
opening < t business at the Stock Exchange to-day.
The recjipt-. of higher quo ations from London,
and of buying orders from that center, led to an
advance of VsÂ® 1 /* per cent right at tie start.
Sugar and the Grangers were In -he lead. Before
the expira-.lon of the first half-hour, however, the
bears had succeeded not Only In wiping out (his
Imp'ovement, but in bringing about a decline of
considerable proportions in a number of Instances.
There were reports of heavy liquidation?, and as a
matter of fact, round amounts of stocks were '
dosed out on stop orJers in Chicago Gas, Sugar
Manhattan and one or two others but in the gen
"ml list the selling demonstrated later In the
session.
In the decline just noted Chicago gas was most
conspicuous, declining 4% 10 56. Sugar fell from
3U9Â»/i to 106%: tobacco from 6 V* to 58% â¢
Burlington i<nd Qulncy. 1% to 70%; Northwest
ern from 98% to 97Vi: ft- Paul from 74 % to
U>73%c: Rock Island from 64% to 63%! Man
hattan from 97V4 to 95% and so on. The bearish
feelins was very prom iiticen and rumors were
revived about gold shipments by Saturday's
steamers, although leading bankers denied that
they had received any orders to export the yellow
metal. In the afternoon the absorption of stocks
for foreign account had a telling effect and Â»s the
belief generally obta Tied that tin- declaration of
the Chicago convention for f re? silver tins been
pretty well discounted, a desire was manifested by
the traders to '/cover shorts and so along, at least
for turn. . \ . . â  .

ward the close, 'when it was stated that at least
i.'5,000 shares of stock would be shipped t > Eur-
One by Saturday's steamers. Suear advanced 2%

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, li.tÂ« July 2.â The ambition of wheat
traders to-day seemed to be to keep in touch with
the vagaries of the New York stock market, and
1 s the action there was very irregular, it required
much ingenuity to, at limes, be in line True there
was not enough business to really make the ses
sion interesting, but what little there was was
transacted in an unsettled manner. The Cincin
nati Price Current summary for last week was
taken as unfavorable ana that started the market
in a slightly firmer figure, the advance being sub
sequently lost and afterward retained. Receipts I
at Chit ago were 13 cars and 44 785 oushels were i
taken from store. - The Northwest had 48S cars, 1
1 against 449 last Thursday. A ear ago the corre
j sponding day was a holiday, heuce no comparison
; Is possible. Liverpool cables were quiet and i/4d
j lower. Closing Continental cables were generally j
j lower. Crop damage reports from the Northwest
were of material assistance to the tone during the
session. Export clearances were quite large at
414,102 bushels. September wheat opened from
66V8C to 66i/B<?Â£6fc>l/4C. sold between 55% c and 57c,
closing at 5b%(356S/ 4 c. &fcG43/ic higher than yes- j
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 68 cars.
CORNâ The holiday spirit pervaded the corn
market, restricting business to the extent of al
most producing a stagnant condition. There has
not been much doing In this market recently, and
with the approaching two days' recess in consid
eration the trade assumed a lifeless appearance.
The Infrequent and slow changes 111 prices were 1
attributable to the action of wheat. The Cincin- I
nati Price Current placed the corn crop in good posi
tion. Receipts were 472 cars, and 416.622 bushels
were taken from store. Liverpool cables were 14a
lower. Export clearances were 324,145 bushels.
September corn opened at 27tVg(52734c, sold be
tween 27Vs@'.i7ty8c and 27^Â® 7%c, closing at
27 % c bid, a shade under yesterday. Estimated
j receipts for to-morrow, 866 cars.
OaTH- Offered but faint recognition of the firm
ton â¢ of wheat when that was present, but was
I always ready to acquiesce In the opposite feeling.
â  Trade was not such as to attract particular atten
! tion. The Cincinnati Price Current reported con-
I tinned fine promises lor the oats crop. Receipts
j were 246 cars and 95,459 bushels were withdrawn
: from store. Export clearances were very large at
! 1.747 bushels. September oats closed a shade
j higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow Mii cars.
FLAXâ Was easy. Cash, 75% c; September, 76c:
I December, 78VÂ«c. Receipts 24 cars. .
PROVISIONSâ Nothing much was done in
{ product. Under a steady hog market prices main
-1 tamed a fairly firm appearance but as there was
! neither pressure to sell nor urgency to buy there
( wat no decided direction to the product market.
Sept-mber pork closed 10c higher, September lard

WOOLâ A local clrcu'ar says: "Of late the Wool
trade has improved. We cannot say tbat prices
for inferior or poorer classes of Wool are better,
j but there is a belter demand lor them, so that It Is
I possible to work them off, which is an important
: item. As to really choice Wools there ate hones
I that they will bring l@Jc * 0> more than the
i prices expected heretofore. The London sales, now
I on. opened to-day, and private wire rdvlces report
m good market at nominally the prices .mil ng at
the last previous sale. The Wool sales at Ukiuh

THE STOCK MARKET.
Values for mining shares were several cents
better yesterday, but the improvement was hardly
noticeable and business continued dull, The close
was firm. - , . , .
Best Â«fc Belcher levied an assessment of 25c.
Tte .Mono and Occidental assessments fall de
linquent In board to-day. ... , â¢',. ' , ;
At the regular monthly meeting of ; the Gold
Mining Exchange it was decided to close the ex
change until Wednesday next and the call board
i until the 13th. ' .
Both stork boards adjourn at noon to-day to 11
a. m. next Wednesday. . â  â 
In the (.hollar mine (old Comstock workings) in j
j the nope above crosscut 460 level, they have :
opened the tenth floor at which', point old ground 1
was encountered, In the winze below this point !
there Is no change worthy of note to record for the j
week. They, shipped to the Nevada mill for re- |
duction duiing the past week .121. tons and 1100 !
pounds of ore. The average battery sample of the !
ore was *24 01. They are repairing in the main
incline and in north lateral drift on 650 level.
In the Pntosi mine (old Comstock workings)
the north drift from the top of the raise from the
4sO level south drift is now out 165 feet: extended
20 Ikai during Ihe week. It has been stopped. An
east crosscut was started from it at a distance of
100 feet irom the top of the raise. It is out 15 feet
:in low-grade quartz. The south lateial drift. 650 j
level, started from the main west crosscut from
the shaft, is now out 104 feet: extended 36 feet
s nee last repor.: face in claytand porphyry. The
work on the tunnel level having disclosed nothing
of material importance, they have suspended
operations at that point. The usual repairs I are
under way. â  .
Private advices from Virginia City state that the
south drift from the station on the 300 level of
shaft 1 in the Norcross-Chollur Brunswick lode
workings was out 110 feet Tuesday night and that
It would be extended 100 feet farther before the
Chollar company will start any crosscuts. The
drift is being run close to and parallel with, the
footwall and is in porphyry and clay.
The sales on regular call at the San Francisco
Stock Board for the first six months of the year
were 2,288,700 shares, aganst 1,609,030 shares
during the same period in 1895. There was a fall
ing off of nearly oO per cent in the sales last month
as compared with May. : - â ââ¢.;â¢.

Moltke'a Remarkable Foresight.
Moltke's foresight was sipnally vindi
cated at the outbreak of the Franco-Ger
man war. It wai commonly reported that
one dayâ in July, 1870â an officer. came
into Moltke's study and said to him : |
"Your Excellency, the relations seem to be
growing so strained that it might be well
to begin preparations for a war with
France." "Do you think things are
so bad as that? â  Well, then,
kindly open that bureau there and pull
out drawer No. 4 on the right-hand side,
and you will find all that has to be seen
to ready cut and dried." :" Even if this
story be not literally true, at. least it is
; quite correct as regards . the gist of it.
Everything relative to such a war had in
-1 deed long aso been weighed and worked
out and decided, and all the necessary or
ders lay ready to the smallest detail, only
requiring the addition of the date for im
mediate dispatch.â The Forum.

FOUND IN A CAVE,
Discovery of a Dairyman
on the Fish Ranch
Road.

BORN BY THE ROADSIDE.
Be'ief That It Is a Child Whose
Mother Was Fcund Suffering
by Dr. Rowell.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call^
908 l.roadway, July 2. )
An infant, which had been murdered,
was brought in from Claremont to-duy. |
The little body was found in a small cave
at the side of the Fish Ranch road. For t
several days a search has been made for j
the body, which was reported several days i
ago, but the cave wss so hidden that a per- ;
son not famiiiar with the locality would j
never find it except by accident.
About three weeks ago Dr. Rowell, who
was called to a case late at night, was
driving out toward Claremont when ne
I card a woman screaming by the roadside.
He at once stopped his bupgy and went to
where the sound came from. He found a |
young woman lying on the road, groaning
with agony, and surrounded by several j
young men. He examined the woman j
and found that she <vas well advanced in
tne pains of maternity. He did all he
could for the sufferer, and as his errand
was as urgent one he was forced to leave.
Before leaving the young woman the
men promised that they would at once
convey her to the Receiving Hospital.
An empty boggy was near by and Dr.
Rowell told the lads to drive to the hos
pital without delay. The woman haa
never been taken to the hospital, and after
the matter was reported the poiice and
Sheriff's office kept a lookout to try and
clear up the mystery, but nothing has
been learned further.
A few days ago Dairyman Cobn, while
out hunting, discovered the remains of a
little infant. He reported the matter to
the Coroner, and search has been kept up
ever since. On account of the secrecy of
the place the body was not found. This
morning the dairyman's son conducted
Deputy Coroner Quellen to the spot where
the babe was concealed.
From appearances the infant had been
dead some time, as decomposition had set
in. The boiy was that of a fuily devel
oped female child. A piece of ribbon was
around t'je neck and it had been drawn j*o â¢
tieht that it was almont buried in the
flesh. The infant appears to have been a I
healthy girl, and everything indicates that j
it was born alive.
As soon as he received the remains Cor- j
oner Baldwin stated that an autopsy I
would be held to determine whather or not j
the child had been murdered by strangu- i
lation. Owinu* to the lack of evidence it is j
hardly probable that the perpetrators of
tbe murder will be found.
It is believed that the young men were j
bringing the girl into Oakland at the time
she was found by Dr. Rowell and that
after the baby's birth they became fright
ened and disposed of it.
FIREWORKS AND SPORTS,
Grand Programme Prepared by
the Citizens of Hay
wards.
G. Toyne Will Be President of the
Day and Fred J. Russell
Orate r.
HAYWARDS, Cal., July 2.â The citi
zens have arranged for a grand celebration
and open picnic on tbe Fourth at Haywards
Park.
The literary exercises will be held In the
pavilion at the park, and will commence
G. Toyne, President of the Day of Haywards' Fourth of July Celebration.
at 10:30. The president of the day will be
G. Toyne. who will read the Declaration
of Independence. Mr. Toyne is one of the
ddest residents of Haywards, and be was
with great difficulty persuaded to accept
the presidency of the day's exercises. He
has a very powerful voice, and as there
will be a very laree crowd present, it was
necessary to procure some one who could
be heard all over the park.
The platform will be appropriately
Â»
draped, and while President Toyne is read
ing tho Declaration of Independence two
pages will form a canopy over him with
two National flags. Fred J. Russell will
be the orator of the day.
There will be several bicycle races for
priz s offered by the local tradesmen. The
rirst race is for boys under 14, the second
is for ladies and the third is open to all
amateurs. The races commence at 9
o'clock.
There will be athletic sports in the after
noon. These embrace a men's race; a
married ladies' race; a race for young man
over 16; a youne ladies' race; a race for
boys under 14; an egg race for girls and a
sack race for boys. The whole affair will
conclude with a display of fireworks and
dancing. â¢

Senator Eli I>eniÂ«on Received by HlÂ«
Friends With Music, Speeches and
. Wine.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 2.â Senator Eli
Denison has arrived home from St. T,ouis
and been welcomed by the Alameda
County Republican Central Committee.
There was a band and much spesch-mak
ing with cooling beverages from the flow
ing bowl. In acknowledging the welcome
Mr. Denison said:
"Mr. Chairman, Republicans and
friends: I thank you for your greeting.
I have been to St. Louis, and think I have
done my duty. We have nominated a
good man, and one who will surely be
elected. On my way all through the East
all the talk I have heard is McKinley, Mc-
Kinley.
"At" first I went to St, Louis under a
cloud, but I got out of it and came out on
top. By the action of a tribunal higher
than a State Convention of California I
was seated, and when I showed my papers
they were pronounced perfect.
"I am glad to be back among you, and I
am ready to take off my coat" with my
friends to push the wheel along to victory.
I am eoine to be with my friends and
stand by them till the last gun fires, and
I feel sure that with our united strength
we can march along to the victory we so
earnestly hope for."
NOW THE METHODISTS.
They Will Adopt a New Style In Indi
vidual Communion Cups Next.
Sunday.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 2.â The First
Methodist Church of this city has abol
ished the old-style communion service,
and at the service next Sunday morning
will use, for the first time, the sanitary
communion outfit â individual CUP 3. The
set differs from those used at the Market
street Congregational Church, where they
were first introduced by Rev. E. S. Chap
man, D.D., in that it is to be used at the
altar-rail instead of being passed through
the audience.
The outfit is composed of three nests of
glasses, each nest containing thirty-six
glasses and a cover. The glasses are filled
from a silver tube, which has six hnters
that turn down into the glas^ setting
underneatn. The trays are "elliptical and
have a half-inch diamond-shaped surface
into which holes are cut to sit the glasses,
but have no handles to carry them by.
One nest of classes will be set on the com
munion-table with the bread on either
side, while the other two will be shelved
just back and above the table until
needed.
TOOK HIS LIFE.
Carl Beck of Castro Valley Shoots Hfm
ftelf With a Kirle.
OAKLAND, Cal , July 2.â The body of
Carl Beck was found on the place of T. H.
Harder, a rancher, in Castro Valley, this
morning with a bullet turough the head
and a rifle beside him. Beck left the
house last night about 9 o'clock and a
couple of hours later a rifle-shot was heard,
but it was supposed he was shooting squir
rels. When he was not about this morn
ing a search was instituted, which resulted
in findinK the body.
Beck was a single man and had no rela
tives in this country as far as known. He
has lived around Haywards about ten years
and is well known. He was a member of
the Mount Eden Gun Club and is reported
to have drank heavily at one of their cele
brations. Since that lime be has been
quite down-hearted, but no one thought
of his ever takine his life.

Piedmont Road Wants to Enjoin the
Tax Collector.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 2.â The Pied
mont and Mountain View Railroad Com
pany has sued County Tax Collector Bar
ber to restrain him from selling its prop
erty for alleged delinquency in the pay
ment of its taxes for the year 1895. It sets
forth that the property was assessed at
$232,000, when it should have been about
$75,000; also that the-e ligures were re
duced by the County Board of Equaliza
tion 50 per cent, to which reduction the
company was not entitled, as its petition
was not filed until after the life of the
board had been extended by C. I. Colgnn
without authority of the State Board of
Equalization. The Tax Collector has re
fused to accept taxes on the basis of the
reduction made by the Board of Equaliza
tion.
Killed a Rattler.
NILES, Cal., July 2.â While out walk
ing in the canyon Miss Susie Bane came
near being bit by a rattlesnake. There
was a party tramping from one camp to
another, when the rattler was seen coiled
ready to strike about four feet ahead of
the young -ady right in the path. Wil

and, grabbing a sticK, struct the reptile
before it could spring. It was killed and
the skin presented to Miss Bane, who
I will have it made into a belt as a memento
1 of the occasion.

At the foot of an ancient oak on the bor
ders of Lake Merritt a burglars' cache has
been discovered.
Beneath the gnarled limb a bullseye lan-

Lived and Kept Their Robbers' Kit.
tern, a bowie-knife, a lot of skeleton keys
and some very ingenious devices for turn
ing the keys of doors locked on the inside,
were found. The latter are new to the
police.
Detective Williams, who has the case in
hand, received his first tip from a pawn
broker, who told him that he had pur
chased a revolver from a one-legred man,
who said he had found it hidden in the
brush. He told the pawnbroker that with
the revolver were several other things, all
tied up in a cloth, near the Kiehth-strpet
bridge.
The vacant lot south of the western end
of the bridge is frequently used as a tryst
ing place by hard characters and the de
tective suspected that be might find some
thing in that neighborhood. The result
revealed a complete burglar's outfit bid
den under a tree.
Near the tree is a spring and wild celery
and ivy grow and the place is very pretty
ana secluded. There is a bucket and an
old mattress near the tree and it is very
evident that the robbers lived there. Evi
dences of small fires are numerous.
Although only half a block from an elec
tric-car track it wou!d be possible to live
for weeks without being discovered.
Creek pirates, tramps and hoodlums
who are vagrants gather at the place and
a watch was kept on the place last nieht.
During the night a man giving the name
of John Murray came across the bridge
and made for the obk tree. He was at
once arrested, but protested his innocence
of any crime. He will be held till his
story of himself is investigated, and if true
he will be released.
The ingenious devices for turning keys
which were found in the burglar's kit
were very peculiar. There are nine of
them, all fashioned from penholders of
different sizes, so that they would fit
almost any ordinary doorkey. Each
holder has a slit in it, into which the
tongue of a key which might be left in the
lock would slip and then the burj-lar
could unlock the door by twisting the key
around. The only way to prevent this
device being successful is to fasten the
keys so that they cannot be turned around.
The outfit is designed especially for
lodging-house burglaries, and the police '
say that the devices for keys will open
nine doors out of every ten.
During the past month a number of
petty room-robberies have occurred, and
on one occasion, not far from the oak
tree hiding-place, three Chinamen were
attacked and robbed. The locality is a
very lonely one, and it is quite likely that i
the lakeside Robin Hoods have been hold- j
ing up people and committing small burg- I
laries for a long time.

by having tne rods there death will be
averted.

BULLOCK IS NOW
IN VICTORIA.
Deserted His Wife and
Family Eight Years
Ago.
HE HAS MARRIED AGAIN
The Dusty Warrant Based on
His Daughter's Testimony
May Be Servei.
LOST SIGHT OF MANY YEARS.
While Deacon of a Church at Hay
wards He Figured in a Big
Sensation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
I JOB Broadway, July 2. f
A. M. Bullock, who leit this city in a
great hurry eight years ago, has been
found at Victoria, B. C. There is a war
rant in the Sheriff's office for him and it is
not improbable that efforts may now be
made to serve it.
Several years ago Bullock was a very re
spected member of a church at Haywards.
He owned a ranch near that place and
was a prominent roan in the community.
One day the whole county was shocked
beyond measure at the story told to her
Sunday-school teacher by his daughter
Maud. For some time previous to the ex
pose it had been noticed that Bullock
had been acting in a very peculiar manner
toward his daughter. At that time Maude
was a handsome girl of 16, with a very at
tractive tigure and was one of the belles of
the county.
The stories of the father's con
duct toward the girl were told
to the authorities and a warrant was
â worn out for his arrest. Bullock evaded
justice and disappeared, and the warrant
was never served.
Sometime aeo the daughter of one of
his former neighbors went to Victoria
and by a strange chance her friends lived
next door to Bullock. The fugitive from
Alameda County did not recognize the
young lady, who was a girl when he left,
but the visitor at once recognized the ex
deacon, who is now in business.
"Mr. Bullock is married again," she
said on her return, "and has some chil
dren. He is in the insurance business and
seems to be a very busy man. From in
quiries made up there no one seems to
know anything of his past history.
"I learned that he married a very esti
mable young lady, who was only 17 years
of ace at the time of the marriage. She
was a regular attendant at the Methodist
Church, and it is believed that she knew
nothing of Bullock's doings in this county.
Knowing that he was a divorced man,
she had grave scruples about marrying
him. The law of Btitish Columbia re
garding divorces is very stringent. In no
case can divorced parlies remarry within
a year, and in some instances they may
not marry while their late partner in mat
rimony is alive.
"These matters sorely troubled Bul
lock's fiancee, but it is said he succeeded
in overcoming tlieru by producing a tele
gram which purported to show that his
ex-wife was dead."
A recent arrival from Victoria, who was
acquainted with Bullock at Haywards,
said Bullock is still an active church mem
ber and that they recently attended church
together.
Soon after Mr. Bullock's flight his wife
obtained a divorce. She is still living in
this county, having recently moved from
Haywards to Oakland. She has several
children, and has had a struggle to orinj;
them up, but sho has done it without any
help, and is a very independent woman.
People who have investigated the matter
believe that Bullock rendered himself
amenable to the divorce laws of British
Columbia by his second marriage. He is
now over 50 years of age, and old enough
to be the father of his present wife.
For many years no one knew what had
become of him, except that he had "gone
North." Interested parties are now de
bating whether to dv up that dusty war
rant and procure extradition papers or
whether to let the matter rest, out of re
gard for the feelings of the daughter, who
is now married to a highly respected man
in the employ of the Southern Pacific.
WATER FOR BERKELEY.
The Supp'y Greatly Increased by Two
. Wells Recently
Driven.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 2.â Two new ar
tesian wells have been developed in Wild
cat Canyon by the Alameda Water Com
pany. One gives a flow of 97,000 gallons a
day and the other 87,000. The combined
flow of the two wells constitutes an in
crease of 25 per cent in the volume of the
company's supply.
The company has been boring for water
for several months past and will continue
to do so in the hope of developing more
wells. It is said thnt the new wells will
enable the Alnmeda Water Company to j
supply ail of Berkeley with water, and it j
is anticipated that the Jong-agitated water !
question will reach a solution.

THE POSTAL CASE.
Both Sides Ready to Contest for Every
Point.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 2.â The attorneys
for Assessor Dalton have filed a demurrer
to the complaint of the Pacific Postal Tele
graph Cable Company, wherein the latter
seek to enjoin the Assessor from selling
their property for the personal property
tax. In granting the temporary restrain
ing oraer, Judce Ogden passed indirectly,
if not directly, upon the sufficiency of the
complaint, or at least that was the opinion
of the company's attorney. The demurrer
will be argued to-morrow.
Assessor Dalton, however, believes other
wise, but being dissatisfied with the man
ner in which District Attorney Snook
handled the case he secured these other
attorneys to represent him. The matter
is to be contested on every point by eacli
Â«ide.

of it in placing the products on exhibition.
The board manifested great interest in
the project, and at once passed resolutions
indorsing the fair, and promising all the
support possible in the shape of proper

AMATEURS AT THE REINS
Marguerite Won the Race for
Members of the Alameda
Driving Club.
SHE OUTCLASSED HER FIELD.
The 2:17 Trot Was Captured by Bruno,
Who Beat His Company in
Straight Heats.
The card for the trotting matinee at In
gleside ye&terday was formed of two
events â a special race for trotters and
pacers owned exclusively by members of
the Alameda Driving Club, to be driven
by their owners, for a purse of $200, and a
$1000 purse for trotters in the 2:17 class.
Tne special pacing event had to be de
clared off for lack of entries. The sport
was very commonplace and the crowd
never grew boisterous in their enthusiasm
over the finishes, none of which were of
the hair-stiffening order. The number of
bookmakers was increased by one, making
three firma now laying odds, and they did
a fairly remunerative business.
Of the original six entries for the gen
tlemen's race, which was best two in three
beats, all responded to the tap of the bell
but Count. In the auction betting Clay H
held sway, going lor $10 against $7 for the
field and *$3 for Don.
The boots laid 5 to 1 against Marguerite
winning the first heat, and this caught the
insiders' fancy, for she was played down
to even money. It proved a cakewalK for
the latter, for she led all the way, pacing
under the wire three lengths in front of
Clay Hin 2:29. The black mare now sold
for $10 with the entire field going for $7.
The second and deciding heat was a repe
tition of the first, Marguerite again head
ing Clay H out in 2:26JÂ£. Mr. McMahon,
her owner, showed himself an adept with
tne ribbons.
The well-known and popular Salinas
horseman, Cherry Hebert, started in the
season well by pulling down the purse for
the 2:17 trot with his bay horse Bruno,
who was cleverly handled by "Jimmy"
Dwain and trotted like a Diece of machinery
in the three straight heats that he placed
to his credit.
The opening betting on this event
showed the market to be a trifle feverish,
the field selling favorite at $20, Margaret
Worth bringing $10 and the field $11.
There was considerable tedious scoring
before McNair finally said "go." Bruno,
drawing the pole, led throughout and,
traveling without a skip, placed the heat
to his credit in 2:19%. with George Wash
ini'ton, who bad been the contending
horse throughout, a good second. After
this decisive win the betting was Bruno
$10, Fitzsimmons $5. the field $5, and the
Eastern horse, Freeland, bringing $4. The
next heat was a repetition of the first,
Bruno and George Washington having it
to themselves from the word. Bruno
always had the foot on George, and led
him out three lengths at the stand in
2:lt*%. It looked all over now, and the
Fresno horse sold against the field at the
rate of $10 against $5. Although it looked
as the stretch was reached as if Freeland
was going to be a dangerous contender, he
could never get closer than three lengths
to Bruno, who placed the heat and race to
his credit in 2:l9JÂ£. Fitzsimmons was
third in this heat, nipping George Wash
ington out at the wire.

NOTES.
Margaret Worth, Lady Thornhill and
Jasper Paulson were all distanced in the
second heat of the 2:17 trot.
F. W. Loeber and Mr. Winship, two
prominent Napa horsemen, were specta
tors at the track yesterday. Mr. Winship
is a director of the Napa Agricultural So
ciety and Mr. Loeber is well known over
the circuit as the owner of the stallion
Granaissin.o.
Fitzsimmons was well fancied by his
stable, but was very unsteady in the differ
ent heats trotted.
Freeland is owned by a wealthy East
erner, who has been using htm for a road
ster the past winter in California. He
will be shipped East in the near future.
Sullivan was subioituted in the sulky be
hind him in place of Monto in the third
heat of the trot, but it made but slight

LUCKY BALDWIN
SHOT AT IN COURT
Emma Ashley Undertakes
to Avenge Her Sister's
Wrong.
HYSTERICAL GIRL'S ACT.
Two Angry Attorneys Confront
Each Other With
Revolvers.
A BIG HOLE IN THE WALL.
One More Dismal Chapter in the
Wetched Story of the Ashley
Sisters.
"E. J. Baldwin ruined my sister Lillian
and disgraced her name, and, not satis
fied with that, he has, with the help of his
paid witnesses and detectives, heaped un
speakable calumny upon her. I have sat
in that courtroom day after day and heard
them swear those foul things, and she is
my sister â and â and "
And the speaker cried. It was Miss
Emma Ashley speaking. She was sitting
in the City Prison. She had just made a
frenzied attempt to kill E. J. Baldwin, and
only an inch of space had intervened be
tween the millionaire's head and her bul
let
For the second time "Lucky" Baldwin
has escaped an enraged woman's revol
ver. The first time his niece, Verona
Baldwin, waited for him in an upper hall
of his hotel and fired two shots at him.
At 9 o'clock yesterday morning Judge
Slack's court was called to order for the
suit of Lillian A. Ashley against E. J.
Baldwin. It was to be the last day, and
the trial was to have ended at 10 o'clock,
when the Craven-Fair case was to have
beeun.
The plaintiff was on the stand being
cross-examined by Attorney Highton of |
the defense as to the identity of several
photographs of herself. It had been con
tended that she had been on more than
friendly terms with one Osborne, and she
had given him one of the pictures. The
picture was shown her, and she was asked
by the lawyer if it was hers.
"It may be," said she, "but I don't
think it is. "
At that instant Emma Ashley, who had
been sitting on a long bench placed along
the wail at the back of the courtroom,
arose and walked over to ti.e rail, seating j
herself directly behind and near Baldwin, j
as he sat with his attorneys and Henry A.
Unruh, his secretary. As she had been in
the habit of sitting in that place, rather j
close to the defendant's party, no notice
was taken of her movements. In fact, the
mild and quiet demeanor of the woman
throughout the course of the triai has been j
marked. Not a sound has ever come from
her, not even a sob, when her sister was
enduring the terrible cross-questioning at
the hands of the defendant's learned at
torneys. She either sat and listened stol
idly or read her Bible, which she carried
in her handbag.
"Are you quite positive that this is not
your photograph? ' asked Highton of the
witness..
"It is not mine, 1 ' shf> answered, "I never
saw it before â I never wore my hair
crimped so."
"Do I understand you to "
Then a pistol shot rang out and a splash
in the plaster on the wall told where a
deadly bullet had found lodgement. Then
the white powder smoke followed, and all
was confusion.
When the startled Judge looked up from
his notes he saw a large woman with a
revolver grasped in b>Â»th hands standing
over Baldwin, who sat limp and speech
less in his chair, his face whiter than the
few locks of hair on his head.
With her weapon a few inches from the
back of his head she had fired, but it be
ing a double action or self-cocking revol
ver the muscular force required to pull
the trigger back had elevated the muzzle
of the gun and the leaden missile went
high to strike the opposite wall.
Before another shot could be fired, if
Buch was the maddened woman's inten
tion, Henry A. Unruh sprang up. and,
reaching over the rail, grabbed her hands.
She held Srmly to her weapon and a fierce
struggle took place. For a few instants
not another move was made. The witness
sat in her chair stricken dumb, her face as
pale as that of the man who had just es
caped death. The attorneys, a few seconds
before engaged in their wordy battle, were
silent, so quickly had it all come upon
them.
But the shock of the unexpected soon
passed and confusion reigned throughout
the room. Attorney Crittenden started
forward just as Unruh wrenched the pistol

PHILADELPHIA. â 
The Scene in Judge Slack's Court Yesterday Morning When Emma Ashley, Sister of the Plaintiff in the Ashley-Baldwin Case, Tried to
Kill the Man Whose Nickname "Lucky" Is so Justly Deserved.
from Miss Ashley. He turned around,
flourishing the weapon in his hand and
faced Crittenden, who doubtless, in his
excitement, thought that Unruh in
tended to assault him. He quickly
threw his right hand to his hip and partly
drew a pistol from his pocket, shouting,
"Drop that gun."
This new stage in the course of affairs
awoke the spectators to the fact that two
excited and angry men were confronting
each other with weapons in their hands, j
Highton and Lloyd soon approached
the two, and Clerk James McElroy sprang
between them and, disarming Unruh,
ordered Crittenden not to draw his pistol.
In the meantime Emma Ashley had run
around to the southern part of the room j
pursued by Baldwin, angry and excited.
While they were struggling together
Judge Slack stepped down from behind
his desk and separated them, and the
qniet and dignity of the court came back
again.
"Mr. Crittenden," said the Judge, "have
you a pistol?"
"Yes, sir," answered the lawyer.
"Deliver it up at once, sir," ordered the
court.
The attorney did so, and the two
weapons soon lay side by side in the clerk's
drawer.
"Mr. Crittenden," said bis Honor
sternly, "you must show cause before this
court why you should not be punished tor
contempt. Why do you come here
armed ?''
"I live across the bay, your Honor, and
carry a pistol simply for Drotection. I
have always done so. I would not have
attempted to draw it had not Mr. L'nruh
made a hostile demonstration toward me
I with the other gun. He was pointing it
directly at me, otherwise I should not
have gone for my own weapon. If I am
cited for contempt I ask that Mr. Unruh
be treated the same, as his action caused
me to act as I did."
"Very well. I will order you both to
appear before me to-morrow morning at
| 11 o'clock."
The court then asked if there were any
: more revolvers in the room, and all present
j denied that they were armed.
Qaiet having settled down upon the
! court the trial was about to proceed, when
Lillian Ashley, who had remained in an
almost fainting condition through all the
I tumult seated in the witness-chair, sud
; denly began to cry.
"O, I can't go on," she said, wringing
i her hands in a pitiful manner; "1 am all
1 unstrung. My baby is sick unto death at
! home and this is the last straw. I don't
j know what to do â what to do, nor what to
! say. What have J done that all this
I should come upon me? It seems that I
; haven't had enough to contend with all
I these terrible days, and now this muet
come! O, my sister, my baby! I can't
Igo on now â I can't."
I And, utterly broken down, the woman
i sobbed in her wretchedness.
"I think we are ali too excited and too
j nervous for further proceedings to-day,"
i said Judge Slack. "I will bear the con
j tempt proceedings to-morrow morning
j and will resume the trial of this case next
| Monday morning at 11 o'clock."
As Miss Emma Ashley was being taken
down to the City Pnson'she acted like a
person demented. She stared up at the
ceiling and sang "Nearer, My God, to
Thee" and fragments of other hymns. She
wanted to kneel down and pray, and said
she bad asked God to direct her, and it
was not his will that her sister's seducer
should die now. One of her sister's attor
neys walked with her, and she asked him
his name, failing to recognize him.
She stood calmly in the police station,
where she was formally charged with as-
I sault to commit murder. In the ma
tron's room she walked up and down the
little apartment, wringing her hands and
crying.
"O, I did it, I did it. I shot him because
he has ruined my poor sister, and ruined
all of us. I sat in the courtroom and heard
his witnesses from the East accuse her of
; gross immorality. And that dear little
baby, Baldwin's own child, that JooKs just
like him, is at home dying, I think, for
want of proper care, medicine and food. I
I sat till morning after court adjourned last
j night and nursed that poor suffering child,
I and this morning I did not take a bite of
I nourishment, but came down to the trial.
"I asked God on my knees this morning
if I should do it, and prayed if it were not
| right to make me fail. I gueaa it was not
I ri^ht. But lam trusting in him even in
ttiis dark hour. I have never done any
thing wrong in my life. I came from my
.'ciiool over two years ago at the call of
LiJlian, who was in trouble. I would have
graduated but this came, and ray nappy
school days were over. Nobody knows
what anguish 1 have suffered, what hard
ships and poverty I have put up with since
I came to California.
"And neither have I suffered alone, for
poor Lillian and baby have suffered, too.
Last Thankseiyine we sat down to a din
ner of thin soup and crackers, aud while
sitting there over that poor meal we read
in a scrap of a newspaper how E. J. BalJ- I
win entertained a party richly. That was
our dessert. God only knows how this will
end, but He is our only trust.''
Then she clasped her hands together,
and, looking upward, began to pray.
In the small Bible which she carried in
her hands during the trial, and which she
must have been reading just before sue
fired the shot at Baldwin, was a mark at
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULr 3, ioye.

NEVER TOUCHED HIM.
Lucky Baldwin Says He Felt the
Bullet Pass the Tod of
His Head.
"Lucky" Baldwin walked jauntily out
of the City Hall and downtown to his
hotel as though one of his horses had
brought home a plethoric purse. Before
he went out of the courtroom he took a
look at the bole in the wall which the bul
let made after missing his head, and
said, "It never touched me."
"I saw my hair fly up," he continued,
"but such things never disturb me. I often
noticed the woman sitting close behind
me, but she seemed to be of a religious
turn of mind and was always reading her
Bible. I did not know of her near pres
ence until I felt the wind of the bullet lift
my hair up and the tingle as the lead flew
so closely over my scalp."
While he was standing in court
room, rather ruthfully looking at the
Miss I mma Ashley, the Young Woman Who Tried to Kill E. J. Baldwin.
pitted wall, Attorney Lloyd clapped him
on the shoulder and said, comfortingly :
"Well, old man. you live up to your name,
and are Lucky Baldwin indeed."
The weapon was a cheap double-action
38-caliber five-chambered revolver. When
examined alter the shooting one chamber
was found empty.
In Police Judpe Joachimsen's court last
evening a warrant was issued for Emma
Amanda Ashley's arrest, with bail fixed at
$10,000. Her attorneys, Crittenden and
Van Wyck, considered this sum excessive
and argued against it, but Baldwin's
attorneys insisted that it should stand in
that sum. An effort will be made to get
the bail reduced.
Yesterday afternoon a physician treated
Emma Asnley's hand, which was badly
wrenched in her struggle with Henry
Unruh.
ALL WERE EXCITED.
Attorney CrSttenden Thought Un
ruh Intended to Assault Him
With Emma Ashley's Pistol.
"The report of that revolver came like a
veritable bombshell to me," *aid Attorney
Crittenden, soon after the snooting. "At
first I couldn't locate the sound and of
course I was much excited. When I saw
Mr. Unruh struggling over the rail with
Miss Emma Ashiev my first impulse was
to learn why and to separate them. As
he jerked the revolver out of her hands
he whirled around as if to meet me with
the weapon pointed directly toward me.
He seemed to be intent upon using it; why
I could not understand. He was certainly
trying to cock the gun and it struck me
that I had better look out for myself.
"So of course I threw my band behind
me toward the pocket in which I carried
my pistol. When I saw there was no need
I did not draw it out, and when I was or
dered to surrender the weapon I did so.
"I imagine we were ali pretty well ex
: cited, and probably did not have a clear
| idea of affairs. I was surprised to see a
young woman so quiet and gentle wrought
up to tne point of using a revolver as she
did. Through all the trial she has sat
silently in the courtroom, and I have
never heard any outbreak from her. She
must have been laboring under some se
vere nervous excitement that made her
unaccountable for her acts."
EMMA A. ASHLEY.
A Quiet, Religious Person, She Was
Not Considered to Ba a
Desperate Character.
Emma Amanda Ashley is a large woman,
weighing over 200 pounds, but is of corn-
pact build and does not appear to weigh
within twenty-five pounds of that figure,
bne is fair, with blue eyes and very light
brown hair like her sister Lillian, and was
born in Vermont twenty-two years ago,
tieine about five years younger than the
plaintiff in the now celebrated Ashley-
Baldwin case. She has always been a
member of the church and of a very relig
ious nature, and even to strangers she ap
peared to be a mild, timid sort of person.
"I would never have considered that
woman of the kind that carry guns," said
Attorney R. H. Lloyd last" evening. "I
have been watching for a possible out
break on the part of th 3 other one, but
have looked upon Emma Ashley as harm
less. I often noticed her sitting near us,
nut paid no partfcuiar attention to that.
It was the appearance of the photograph
that started her out of her lethargy. It
proved that the plaintiff had not told the
truth regarding the pictures of herself
that Osborne had. This woman, in all
probability, recognized the photograph,
and realizing that the game was lost, was
excited to frenzy and pulled her gun for
deadly work."
LILLIAN'S STORY.
She Js at a Total Loss to Account
for Her Sister Emma's Des
perate Act.
Miss Lillian Ashley was seen at her
room shortly after the shooting. She was
trying to prepare a flaxseed poultice for
her baby, who is very ill with bronchitis.
The little child lay tossing on the bed, its
tiny face drawn in the intensity of its suf
fering. At the request of its mother it
looked up and lisped that it was "Lucky
Baldwin's baby girl."
"I do not understand it at all," said the
mother, "and I am not able to tell any
thing about the incident. It is so unlike
sister. That is not her disposition, and I
never heard her speak as though she was
desperate. lam also at a loss to account
for the pistol. If she had it all the time
she -has kept the fact from me. Oh, why
has all this come upon us?
"When I was in such deep trouble I
thought of my young sister at school and,
having no one else to apply to, I sent for
her. When she, arrived here baby was
several months old, and that was the first
she knew of my being a mother. You
may well imagine her feelings, but she
hurriedly put her sorrow away, and has
been a good and a most patient nurse to
our helpless innocent baby. There never
was a sacrifice too great that she was not
willing to make for this child without a
father. We two wretched sisters have
struggled for our three lives such as few
women have struggled before. But no
need to speak of the past when the dread
ful present and the more dreadful future
is at hand.
"In October, 1891, I met E. J. Baldwin
in my happy Eastern home. I had every
comfort and life looked very hopeful to
me. Now look at me. Fair name gone; I
womanhood ruined; feeding upon the
ashes of a dead life; a veritable Hester
Prynne walking through the scornful
multitude.
"Sister has had but little sleep for almost
a week, being at the trial all day and
sitting up much of the night with this
child. She must have grown so nervous I
that she was not accountable for her
actions. I can't find any other reason and
I am wholly in the dark regarding the
whole matter."
JUDGE SLACK'S ACTION.
How His Honor Restored Order
After the Attempted
Murder.
Judge Slack's actions throughout the
exciting scene in his courtroom were such
as might have been expected on the part
of that decisive official. The report of the
pistol of the would-be murderess had
hardly died away before his Honor set
about restoring order. He left the bench
and coming down past the clerK's desk
commanded the excited attorneys and
spectators to take their seats.
Miss Emma Ashley had been disarmed,
but Lawyer Crittenden and Superintendent
Unruh seemed about to spill one another's
blood. Judge Slack's determined words
brought the men to a realization of their
surroundings, and in a moment, except
for the sobbing of Lillian Ashley, the
courtroom baa resumed its usual quiet.
After court adjourned, the Judge told
several reporters his impression of the
dramatic scene.
"1 was engaged looking over a paper
which had been handed me," he said, "and
not looking in the direction of Mr. Bald
win when the shooting took place. The in
stant the report sounded I looked up and
saw Miss Ashley holding the pistol in her
hand. Mr. Unruh immediately grasped
her and took the pistol from her. While
the young woman was being secured, Mr.
Crittenden and Mr. Unruh seemed in dan
ger of getting into a difficulty.
"I commanded them to be seated. Mr.
Unruh held the pistol which he had taken
from Miss Ashley and Mr. Crittenden's
attitude suggested that he might draw one
from his pocket.
'After order was in a measure obtained,
I asked Mr. Crittenden if he had a pistol
in hie pocket. He acknowledged that he
had and handed it to the clerk. No one
else acknowledged being armed. I then
ordered both Mr. Crittenden and Mr. Un
ruh to appear in court to-morrow and ex
plnin their actions.
"The attorneys on both sides were ready
to continue the case, hut Miss Lillian
Ashley, who was testifying when the
trouble occurred, was on the verge of hys
terics and I thought it better to continue
the hearing until Monday."

Fruit Shipments.
Fruit shipments from California for the first
six months of the year are somewhat below
those of the year before, owing to the
bactwardness of the season. For tfte six
months ending with June 30, 1895, there were
shipped 623 carloads, including 90 carloads of
apples. For the same period of 1896 438 car
loads were shipped, and these shipments in
cluded no apples, as this fruit is about three
weeks late. ._.
