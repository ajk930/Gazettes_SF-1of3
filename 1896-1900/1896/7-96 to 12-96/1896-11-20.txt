WEYLER BEATEN
IN EVERY BATTLE
Press Censorship Prevents
the News From Being
Sent Out.
Cubans Declare That No Honest
Man Can Live Under Span
ish Rule in the Island.
Patriots Continue to Fight Ga'lantly
for Fretdcm and Capture Sev
eral Important Strongholds.
TAMPA, Fla., Nov. 19.â A number of
prominent Cubans arrived by the steamer
Olivette from Havana this evening and
.will make their homes m Jacksonville and
Ocala until the conflict ends They de
.clare that no honest man who has any re
spect for his famiiy can live under Spanish
law as it is administered on the island.
A prominent Cuban said relative to the
engagement reported between Maceo and
Weyler that important battles bad been
fought and that Weyler had been defeat
ed. Owing to the surveillance of the Gov
ernment definite news has not been re
ceived in this country, but it was true all
Cubans in Havana knew through their
ofheial sources. He stated this intorma
tion could be given the American people
with every confidence. They further
stated that Port au Principe, Cascora and
Guamaro were all in the hands of the
Cubans under Calixto Garcia and h s aids.
Among the reports is that Weyler is
wounded.
MADRID, Spain, Nov. 19.â A dispatch
to the Impaicial from Havana says that
Captain-General Weyler has reached the
town i f San Cristobal, about fourteen
leagues northeast of the city of Pinar del
Rio and about midway between hat city
and Havana. Maceo's headquarters are
said to be in the bids between San Cristo
bal and Cayabas.
HAVANA. Cuba. Nov. 19.â A train con
veying troops was wrecked to-day near
Mangas by the explosion of dynamite
bombs which had been placed in position
by rebels. Founeen persons were wound
ed. The train was crossing a culvert when
the exp osion occurred. The insurgents
placed five bombs for the purpose of blow
ing up the train, bat one of them did not
explode. It is s^aid here that the rebels
thought General Weyler was on the train.
NEW YORK, N. V*. xVov. 19.â Secretary
cieQuesadaof the Cuban Junta stated to
rfaT t.mr t<e htrt just received most favor
able news of the situation in Cuba.
"I have just heard by mail," said Mr
de Quesda, "from General Carrilio, in
charge ot the province of Las Villas. He
informs me that he has jast met General
Sanchez, who was comine from the eas'
ern department with re-enforcements,
and that the situation presents a most
cheerful aspect in that section, which em
braces the larger half of the eastern end
of Cuba.
"I have also received letters from the
eastern department irom civil Governor
Cespedes, which are also very encourae
ing. He is establishing public schools
throughout the interior. The fact that
we have already appointed a civil Govern
ment in the eastern part of the island,
which is entirely in our hands, and that
schools have been opened to the less in
telligent, proves that our po ition in this
province is certainly a most strong one.
"Although nothing of importance has
rr ached me yet in rpiation to the military
operations by the Cuban leaders I have
received word that the Cuban forces are
gradually advancing westward,"
GENERAL WESLER WRIPPED.
Howard Saya It la Time for the Span
ish Hutcher to Heaign.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 19.â 1n an inter
view to-day anent the rumor that General
Weyler had resigned from the command
of the Spanish forces in Cuba, General O.
O. Howard, ex -commanding general of the
United States army, said: "As I see.Gen
eral Weyler was a beaten man and it was
time for him to resign. His troops were
whipped and bis strategic resources were
at an end when he went back to Havana.
The individual rear movement of Weyler
â¢ showed the inability of the Spanish army
to dislodge the insurgents. If he could
have whipped them he would have stayed
and whipped them. His retirement was
the beginning of the end so far as Weyler
is concerned. My view of the Cuban war
is simply this: It is a question of finances,
not of nghting. Spain is big enough to
crush out every cane bush as well as
insurgent in Cuba, if she can raise the
money to pay and provision the troops re
quired, but Spain has a mighty big job on
her bands. It has already been clearly
proved that the Cubans are greater fight
ers, greater strategists and a greater peo
ple. Whether Spain can raise enough
money to pay the men is something about
which the world is guessing."
General Howard thinks the Cuban war
has developed nothing new in tactics. He
declined to express an opinion as to
whether the United States should inter- I
fere on behalf of the insurgents.
NOT ALLOWED TO CELEBRATE.
Spanish Authorities Have 2fo Sympathy
for Cuban Martyr: â¢;
NEW YORK, N. V., ' Nov. 19.-Letters
received in this city from/Havana an-
Bounce that the Spanish Government has
taken every precaution to avoid any pub
lic demonstration on November 27, the
anniversary of the execution of the stu

PREPARING FOR EM ERGENCIES.
Big Contract for Anna Given to the
Winchester Cnnipony.
NEW HAVEN, Conk.. Nov. 19.â The
Register this afternoon prints a story that
the Government, "before noon to-mor
row." will place an order witb the Win
chester Arms Company for 100,000 rifles of
tne Lee pattern, the standard small arms
of the American army. This announce
ment is made on the authority ol a com
mercial agent who had it irom an official
of the Winchester Arms Company. As
usual, the Winchesters will not talk. Ac
cording to this agent, the contract is due
to the relations between this country and
Spain, and a desire on the part of the
Government to be prepared for an emer
gency. _
TRIAL OF FILIUSTERS.
â  ' " â â
Evidence Against Members of the
Zauradn'M Crete Presented.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 19.â The trial
of Emilio Nunez and Captain Charles R.
Dickman was ' resumed to-day. John
Deumer said he had been a fireman on
the Laurada during her alleged filibuster
ing trip last May. His testimony was
almost similar to that of tb> alleged spy,
Quinn, and the other witnesses who testi
fied yesterday.
On cross-examination witness . stated
that he had received money since leaving
the Laurada on several occasions ; from
some person whose name he did not know.
Martin' Kasparit said he had been a
seaman on the Laurada, and his story was
in the main similar to that of the previous
witnesses. He was also under pay.
Captain Henry W. Mosher, of the tug
Volunteer, tetified ;o having towed the
lighter Green Point, loaded with boxes
and other packages, from Astoria to the
Laurada, off Montauk Point, on May 4.
With Captain M sher's .testimony, evi
dence for the Government closed.
Counsel for the defense then requested
Judge Broan to direct a verdict of acquit
tal on the ground that there had been no
evidence to show that any crime had been
committed. . ; .
General Tracy raised the question
whether the case of the defendants came
within the jurisdiction of the Southern
Di- trict of New York, or even within the
trritory of the .United States. The con
stitution provided, he said, that the ac
cused must be tried within the district
where the offense was committed. Mon
tauk Point, he said, is in the Eastern Dis
trict of New York. General Tracy said
that the prosecution must show that Cap
tain Dickman knew before he left New
York that men alleged to have been on
board ;he Laurada intended to arm them
selves, as they are said to have done alter
tney left Montauk Point. No offense com
mitted in this the Souihern trict had
been proved against the captain.' ;
His Honor, denied the motion to instruct
an acquittal. ; Â j! : y- : A
' Counselor Reubens, after a few words to
the jury, in which he said the statement
of the ca>e for the defense would be left to
the summing up, called A. \V. Barrs of
Jacksonville, Fla., a real e-tate dealer.
Witness said he had seen the Laurada at
Hard port. He had gone out to the Lau
rada on a tug. He said the statements of
the witnesses lor the prosecution that the
Cubans had given Captain Dickman orders
were absolutely untrue. Witness and a
friend had visited the Luurada once on the
tug and later in a skiff, but on neither oc
casion had Colonel Nunez given any
orders.
On cross-examination witness admitted
he was a sympathizer with the Cubans,
addintr: "I don't see how anybody can live
in this country and not be."
General Tracyâ So say we all of us.
At the. conclusion of the testimony of
this witness an adjournment was taken
until to-morrow morning, when General
Tracy will begin the summing up.
BAD MANAGEMENT IN MANILA
Spain Seem* to Be Conducting a Gu-aa-
Tou-Hlraae Wir.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 19. âThe Hong
kong Daily Press of October 17 contains
the latest news of the Philippine rebellion
rece.ved from its special correspondent, as
follows:
MANILA. Oct 13.â The third batch of
troops arrived to-day, 1200 in number.
This places altogether over 3000 men in
the Philippines ready for the field, which
added to the native troops, who so far
have with few exceptions b*en loyal to
the Spanish, should give a sufficient num
ber to exterminate the poorly armed reb
els now holding forth in Cavite. It should
be a sufficient number, but it seems to be
tne opinion that the rebels will still flour
ish and be able to defend themselves
against any serious blow for some time, at
least until the rest of the band of troops
expected have arrived and are in the field.
Tne Spanish also show an inclination to
lay aside and not to take any chances of
defeat until the otber troops arrive, when
with a large force their success would, at
least in their eyes, appear certain. From
wnat we saw of the soldiers, it would
seem that considerable time could be
wisely spent in equipping the troops, for
work in the fie.d cannot be successfully
carried on when the outfit of a soldier is
limited to a gun and cartridge-case. The
commissary department seems to be
limited loan officer in gorgeous uniform
ana two Indians, with a couple of old iron
pot 3; and the medical department to a
doctor with a medicine chest. No doubt
they are better off than that, although
that is exactly the outfit, so far as could
be seen, of the body of troops embarking
for Cavite. It is, however, certain that
they are extremely weak in organization.
Some disloyalty has been shown by some
of the Indian marines on shore duty, who
fired npon some Spanisn troops, whiie the
nauvo troops at Mindan have revolted
seizing forta and gunboats on the lake
and, in fact, are in full possession. The
Spanish troops have been firing at each
other as a result of a blunder in maneuver
ing, and considerable loss has been re
ported.
Governor-General Blanco no doubt is
trying to conduct the campaign in the
way it should be, and to him alone is
credit due for so little killing taking place
in and about Manila. It iÂ» unfortunate,
however, that officers who have the execul
tion of his orders in hand are not of the
same opinion.
The bi â¢ .French warship Isly arrived in
the harbor last night. The report that
affairs are quieting down and the rebellion
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 20, 1896.
"Well, I guess I can get ready for Thanksgiving now/
about over is altogether false, for the rebels
are in a better condition to-day than they
ever were, and it has been only during the
last few days that a large estate not a
dozen miles from Manila was seized and
the rebels occupied it undisturbed. The
city of Manila its j lf, however, is undoubt
edly safe.
OREYFUS THE VICTIM OF A PLOT.
Reopening of a Famous Case A/most
Causes the Overthrow of the
Me/me Ministry.
LONDON, Eng., Not. 19.â A Paris dis
patch to tie Pa.l Mall Gazette says that
the Ministry had a very narrow escape in
the Chamter of Deputies yesterday, and
nothing but the patriotism of a number of
Deputies saved it from overthrow. Hos
til-ty of the Chamber was also aroused by
the overbearing attitude and tone of Gen
eral Billot, Minister of War, in bis state
ment which Premier Meline at first was
not disposed to supplement until he saw
that his own friends were leaving him.
In view of the situation the Premier was
compelled to accept a compromise in the
shape of a modification of the motion, 'M.
Castelane demanding that tl c Govern
ment tafce action in the case of the reports
that Dreyfus had been the victim of a plot
and expressing confidence that the Gov
ernment would endeavor to punish the
puilty persons. The opinion in the lobby
after the debate was that the Government
would be obliged to order new prosecu
tions in connection with the case of Drey
fus, many members expressing the belief
that it would be better for the country to
have shot Dreyfus than to pay Â£2500 a
year to keep him in confinement.
A dispatch from Paris says: The Jour
nal understands that as a result of yester
day's debate In regard to Dreyfus the Min
ister of Justice has ordered a reopening of
the inquiry into the matter.
REV. J. C. HULL PLEADS GUILTY.
Admits That He Poisoned His Wife and
Escapes With Six Years'
Imprisonment.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 19.â The trial
of Rev. James C.Hull for poisoning his
wife came to a dramatic end this after
noon. Dr. Hull changing his plea to
guilty. A few minutes before noon Prose
cuting Attorney Butler placed in evidence
a letter which Hull wrote last Jfebruary
to a pastor in California, saying his wife
was slowly dying of a cancer and that she
could not live the year out This letter
contradicted Hull's previous testimony,
especially as it had been shown that Mrs!
Hull did not have a cancer and that Hull
was aware of that fact, having been told
so by Dr. Hawkins, bis family physician.
At the opening of the afternoon session
8. L. Pierce, Hull's attorney, told Hull
that the California letter in effect contra
dicted him and advised him to plead
guilty.
This the latter did and Judge Egan sen
tenced him to six years' imprisonment in
the State prison at Stillwater. The trial
had been in progress four dave Hull had
insured his wife's life for $2000 and spent
several weeks trying to poison her with
arsenic. Up to last winter Hull was pas
tor of the Clinton - avenue Methodist
Church and created a sensation by taking
a decided stand against the A. P. A.
Tom /Coed in chicnr/o.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 19.â Hon. Thomas
B. Read arrived in Chicago to-day on nis
homeward journey from California, where
he did effective stump work for the Presi
dent-elect. He was accompanied by his
daughter and Congressman Frank Aldnch
of this city, whose guest the Speaker was
at an informal luncneon given at the
Union League Club with a small party.
Mr. Reed declined to talK on political
matters and remained at the club until it
was time for him to leave to take the
Pennsylvania limited train for New York
at 6:30 o'clock.
RUBS PEPPER INTO
BUTLER'S WOUNDS
Tom Watson Arraigns the
Senator fcr Double
Dealing.
By His Disloyal Policy the Cam
paign Chairman Wrecked
the P opie's Party.
The Georgian Refuses to Recognize
the Right to P ace H:m Under
Democratic Tricksters' Heels.
ATLANTA, Ga., Nov. 19.â The Consti
tution will print the following to-morrow
morning: Tom Watson has been rubbing
more red pepper into the wounds of Sena
tor Marion Butler. In his paper, out yes
terday, he published his answer to Butler
and it is without an v sign of conservatism.
In his reply Mr. WfttSOÃ says in part:
'â You did not dare to publish it (the
first letter) because you felt its arraign
ment of you to be unanswerable. Mr.
Washburn'B telegrams (to which I was no
party) did not control you then in not
I'iiblishine the letter any more than they
control you now in suppressing it. The
truth is, Senator, you feel yourself to be a
deeply guilty man, as indeed, you are.
Instead of managing this ereat campaign
in a spirit of broad patriotism and of
courageous loyalty to your nominee and
your iÂ»arty, you have allowed your per
sonal ill will to divert you into a tortuous,
narrow, jealous and disloyal poiicy, which
has shipwrecked the People's party and
brought the success of Mr. Bryan to a
crisis of extreme peril.
"You now plead with me to pull you
out of the hole. I shall do nothing of the
kind. You picked your way into it and
you must picK your way out.
"Senator, you were selected as chair
man to help me with this campaign, you
were expected to act with me and for me.
You have not done so. You have acted
without me aad you have acted against
me. In nothing have you consulted me.
At no time have you told me of your
plans or your purposes.
"In all this you may be right and I may
be wrong. The committee called off by
you to one side at Chicago has sustained
you and censured me. Therefore my po
sition is most painful. Ti.e Bryan-Sewall
committee is against me and the Bryan-
Watson committee isagainst me. I stand
alone.
"But, Senator, I was a Populist while
yon were still camping with the Demo
crats, and I have always been a middle-of
the-road Populist, while you never have
been. You have always been a protection
ist, and you bargain with the Republicans
in one campaign and with the Democrats
in another. In this campaign you have
bargained with both Democrats and Re
publicans. God only knows which bar
gain you intend to keep. As for me, I
turn from you and appeal to the real,
true-hearted Populists. If I have sinned
against right I am right in demanding
that the party and Us creed be protected
by the Democrats who came to us for help.
"But Ido not recognize your right to
put me under the heels of the Democratic
tricksters and bosses, and I shall continue
to claim the privilege of speaking and
writing for the National nominees of the
People's party. Ido not believe that the
time hay jet come when Populists will
say it is treason to be loyal to the Populist
ticket. It is unnecessary for me to say
that my letter of acceptance must stand
just as it is written."
CONTESTS IN THE HOTEL
speaker jfÂ£e*dr* -.b'eii*4t>te .Method* . Cause
--'*â¢-"â.'*; Them . to !>â  er-aie.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 19.â As yet
Representative Bowers of the San Diego
district : has filed ? no notice of contest
against Castle. There is the gratifying
prospect that there will be but few con-;
tested. election cases in the next : House of
Representatives. Thus far, instead of the
large number of notices filed of intention
to contest, less / than a dozen members
who were' defeated at; the election have
announced that they will dispute the re
sult 'of . the ballot. Tim diminution 'of
a number of cases is the result of Speaker
Reed's: admirable disposition of these
cases in the present House.
When the Fifty-fourth Congress met
there were no less than thirty contests be
fore the House. Mr. Reed accordingly ap
pointed three committees on elections and
divided the contest between these three
committees. The result is that there re
mains on the calendar of the House oniy
one or two contests. Each of the election
committees having only a few cases found
itself able to try every contest carefully
and deliberately. Not one of the contest
ing parties in any of the cases has ex
pressed himself other than fully satisfied
that he received absolute justice at the
hands of the committee. The chairman
of each committee announced at the out
set of bis work that every man would be
given ample opportunity and sufficient
time to present h s case before the com
mittee in its most advantageous form.
There has never been a word of criticism
of the work of these three committees.
They have been absoluely non-partisan.
Indeed, in several cases the committees
have decided unanimously against the
Republicans.
The result has been that the disposition
of defeated candidates to enter upon con
tests relying more upon the majority in
the Hous- than upon the justice of their
claim has been checked. The Republican
Congressional Committee has, up to the
present time, been notified by six Re
publican candidates of their intention to
contest. In each instance the defeated
candidate has asked the opinion of the
committee as to the merit of his case,
from which it is safe to say the decision of
the committee as to the wisdom of the
contest may be accepted by the candi
dates. Thus, Mr. Setile of North Caro
lina announced immediately after the
election that he would contest the seat of
his opponent, but has since declared his
intention to abandon the contemplated
proceedings. The Congressional Com
mittee will meet shortly before Congress
assembles to discuss the situation, and the
number of contests that will be actually
filed will depend largely upon the result
of the committee's investigation. Chair
man Babcock and Secretary Mercer are in
hearty accord with the policy of Speaker
Reed, which has always been to discounte
nance contests.

,' Gossip bout the â¢ possible appointment
of M. A. Hanna to V. be Secretary of the
Treasury has come to an end with the dia
covery of the fact that he is not eligible to

be Secretary of the Treasury and he shows
no signs of abandoning his determination
not to accept any political position what
soever.
The Cabinet-makers are suggesting John
Russell Young of Philadelphia for Secre
tary of the Navy, and rumors come from
Chicago that Lyman Gage of that city
may be urged for Secretary of the
Treasury. The statement that Joseph P.
Smith is to be appointed Marshal of the
District of Columbia has not been veri
fied. Mr. Smith is one of Mr. McKiniey's
efficient and loyal adherents, and bis se
lection for this or an equally good place
would occasion no surprise. The office of
Marshal of the District of Columbia is
worth about $15,000 a year. The Marshal
is the executive officer of the district and
is often asked to make the presentations,
at the Presidential receptions.

TEINS WANTS A PLACE.
Friend* of F.x-Stnt* Chairman John
Grant Urge Him for a Portfolio.
DALLAS, Tex., Nov. 19.â Nearly 200
Republicans of prominence, representing
all sections of Texas, met here to-day to
promote the movement in ihe interest of
procuring a Cabinet po-itioninthe coming
McKinley administration for ex- State
Chairman John Grant, who is now the
National Republican Comniitteeman for
Texas. Dr. Grant during the recent cam
paign had much friction with State Chair
man E. H. R. Green and General J. N.
Huston of Indiana, who was sent here by
Mark Hanna to look after campaign
affairs. Grant's friends assert that neither
they nor their chief have any enmity for
Chairman Green, but they are bitter
against General Huston. Many telegrams
and leters were read at to-day's meeting
expressing sympathy with its objection.
Judge C. L Evans was temporary chair
man and Judge J. M. McCormick pre
sided permanently. Many speeches were
made and a strong tribute to Dr. Grant
paid in a series of resolut ons which were
adopted. It is the intention to formulate
a memorial and petition to Major McKin
ley in harmony with the action of the
meeting, getting as many Republicans
throughout th State to sign the petition
as soon as possible recommending Dr.
Grant for a Cabinet pos tion. A com
mittee will carry these documents to Can

in person.

Democrats Claim That dough Was Aot
Elected Governor.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 19.â T. A. Ros
ing, chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee, General E. M. Pope,
secretary of the same committee, and
Thomas D. O'Brien, Minnesota member
of the Democratic National Committee,
met here to-day to consider the advisabil
ity of contesting the election of David M.
Clougb as Governor of Minnesota. The
returns showed the election of Cloufch by
a plurality of 3560 votes. A great many
ballots were thrown out because of imper
fect marking. The Democrats claim that
a great many of these were all right as to
Governor, but were improperly thrown
out because of double markings as to
Bryan and Palmer electors. Over 300 of
these ballots are reported in one county.
If Mr. Rosing and his associates find tUat
the imperfect ballots number as much as
400 they will contest and ask for a re
count.

ot the United Associated Presses that he
was out of politics and did not care to
give an interview.
"McKinley's election," be said, has
given a great impetus to business already."
He knew of one enterprise that Had raised
11.300,000 since ejection.
As to the Cabinet he cared to say noth
ing. "McKinley," he concluded, "has a
great opportunity, and I believe he will be
equal to it in every way. His speeches at
Canton showed his ability as a states

Brilliancy of Its Light Caused
Residents to Rush to
Their Windows.
Many Theories Concerning the Strange
Phenomenon, but the Mystery
Is Yet to Bi So ved.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 19.â There
have been as yet no new developments of
a trustworthy character in this locality in
regard to the mysterious aerial visitant
which swept over this city on Tuesday
evening, with the exception tnat the num
ber of persons who saw its brilliant search
light are daily growing more numerous,
or lather in light of what has been pub
lished have less fear of public censure and
less hesitancy in making their identity
known.
There are residents on the outskirts of
the city who declare that they received
notice of the pas-ing of the airship by
having their apartments illuminated by
the brilliancy oi its electrical light, and
rushing to their windows under the im
pression that some neighboring residence
was ablaze saw the brilliant light moving
through the air overhead. In the mean
time airao-t the sole i-Ã¼bject of conversa
tion is the mysterious visitant, and the
leading greeting is: "Have you seen the
airship?"
Those who failed to catch a glimpse of
this brilliant light still persist in regard
ing it ratlfer in thn shape of a hoax, and
numerous stories have been circulated of
toy balloons, birds witb Chinese lanterns
attached and similar ridiculous explana
tions of this strange phenomenon, Dut
those who were eye-witnesses â and their
names are legion â are strenuous in their
declarations that this can oy no means be
a myth, but was an aerial vessel of some
description.
Ainoni: these eye-witnesses there were
several who wore practical electricians,
and who claim that in their judgment this
lieht was of an eiectrical character, and
they also claim that to produce a light of
this size and brilliancy it would require at
least one horsepower, and that would
mean a vessel capable of sustaining half a
ton weight for i he light alone, and the
one thing most of th.j witnesses to the
phenomenon are positive about is that the
licht was white, like that shed by an arc
lamp.
Weather Observer Barwick is at bb much
loss as anybody to account for the appear
ance in the sky. He says the color of a
rueieor would be affected by the density of
'he atmosphere through which it was
darting, and on an evening like that of
Tuesday, he believes, the light of such an
aerial visitor would most likely be pur
plish, and in no event the extreme white
oi an arc lamp.
At all events there can be no possible
room for doubt that something ex
tremely mysterious parsed over this city,
and its passage was viewed by hundreds
of Sacramento's best citizens. This no
one denies, and yet there are hundreds
who laugh the idea to scorn that the se
cretofaerial navigation has been solved,
yet wait in fearfand trembling lest some au
thentic news be received of the "xistence
of a veritable airship, a,nd they find that the
Jaugh has been turned upon themselves.
ONE BELIEVER IX OAKLaND,
John Grieiter Say the Secret of Aerial
Xarigation la Solved.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 19.â The account
of the flying-machine which was seen
passing over Sacramento Tuesday night
has been read with great interest by one
man, at least, in this city. John Grie>er
of 374 Twelfth street has hammered tacks
into his shoes and studied the possibili
ties of making a flying-machine Cor many
years. He has not rested at studying the
problem, but has put much of his time
during spare hours to the work of con
structing something along the line of an
aerial ship. It was only the fore part of
August that he made a very su cessful
trial of his machine. When seen by a
Call representative he said:
"I was much interested in the article in
to-day's Call and the picture that ii.us
trates it. The man who designed that
machine has the true idea of aerial navi
gation I believe. One mast have a bal
loon of sufficient carrying or lifting ca
pacity to support at least half of the
weight to be carried and then means to
navigate the air to do the balance. I am
a firm believer in the snecess of man to
navigate the air and am ready to accept
the news that some one has at last suc
ceeded as toid in the story from Sacra
mento.
"I have no doubt but that some one in
the country has been at work on a ma
chine and after getting one that would
work had been out for a ride, when he
got too low and was discovered.
"If I could have had an opportunity to
get out and try my models I should have
bad a successful machine before this time.
When I did make an experiment out in
the street at an early morning hour I
managed to move myself about, but strik
ing the wires broke my machine. It baa
not since been repaired.
"1 first took to working on a machine
three years ago from reading an article
which quoted an English scientific gentle
man who said it was a possibility to be
solved. I have never had the assistance
of any man or of any money to develop
my models, and, with the exception of a
boy, I do not allow any one to see what
work I have done. He went and made up
a big story about what he was doing and
told it to a reporter some time since."
An Extensive Assignment.
CHICAGO, 111.. Nov. 19.â The Probst
Construc-ion Company assigned this after
noon to Gustave Willitt. Ttie company is
one of the largest contracting concerns in
the country and its headquarters are in
New York. No statement of assets and

FRANK ARBUCKLE'S
PECULIAR DEATH
Found Unconscious in the
Street He Expires at
a Hospital.
Foul Play and Rcbbery Sus
pected, but No Evidence Can
Be Found.
The Deceased Was a Prominent Poli
tician and Business Man of
Colorado.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 19.â Frank'P.
Arbuckle of Denver, chairman of the
State Democratic Committee of Colorado,
receiver of public moneys of that State
and a business man of great wealth, was
found unconscious in uuper Eighth ave
nue, near One Hundred and Fifty-third
street, this morning by the police and
aied shortly after being removed to a near
by station-house.
There were no marks of violence on the
body, but there was a distinct smell of
liquor about it and the detectives were
sent out at once to make an investigation.
They went to Captain Savers' Atlantic
Casino at One Hundred and Fifty-fifth
street and there learned that a man
answering the description of the dead man
in every particular, had been in the Casino
between 11 and 12 o'clock last night.
Charles Horstman, the bartender, said
that the man then had a handsome watch
and chain. He remained in the Casino
for half an hour, and while there bought
several drinks and showed a large roil of
bills.
Of his movements after that the police
have been able to learn nothing. They
examined the ground where he was found,
but not a trace of a struggle was indicated.
There was no watch on the body when it
was searched at the station-house, and but
for the statement of the bartender the po
lice have no evidence that would point to
robbery or assault.
The neighborhood where the dying
man was found has an an savory reuuta
tion, and just thereabouts are a number
of Raines-law hotels, frequented by boat
men and women of low character. Nearly
every week the police receive a report of
tome robbery from the vicinity.
Fred Fiegel, editor of the Tammany
Times, identified the dead man as Frank
P. Arbuckle, a mine-owner and politician
of Denver.
Mr. Arbuckle had been in this city for
one week, and daring that time had been
a guest of Mr. Fiegel at his residence, 236
West Thirty-ninth street Mr. Arbcckle,
when last seen by any of his friends, wag
in Fourteenth street, near the Tammany
Hall, at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. He
was with Mr. Fiegel and was in excellent
health and spirits.
After a few minutes' conversation with
Mr. Fiegel he went away, saying, "I'll see
you at 6 o'clock at the house." He did
not go to the house, however, and was
next heard of when Mr. Fiegel identified
his body in the station-house a few min
utes after 10 o'clock this morning. How
and why he went to upper Eighth avenue
is a mystery and the police as well as his
iriends are at a loss to account for it
Mr. Arbnckle was president of the High
lands Water Company and the Highlands
Electric Light Company of Denver, and
had a large fortune in real estate and min
ing property in addition at Cripple Creek
and Central City. He leaves a widow and
three childrenâ two boys, 13 and 15 years
of respectively, and a daughter, married
and living in Denver.
Coroner's Physician O'Hanlon per
formed an autopsy on the body to-night.
He found fatty degeneration of the heart
sufficient, he said, to produce death.
There Was slight gastritis in the stomach,
vhich may -have been due to alcohol or
some irritant poison. To settle t is ques
tion definitely the contents of the stomach
will be analyzed. There was also found
congestion of the brain, which might have
been caused by alcohol.
A very slight contusion on the scalp
back of the right ear and a slight hemor
rhage of the right kidney were probably
caused by falling to the ground. They were
not, the doctor said, the result of an as
sault. Up to a late hour to-night no ar
rests had been made. When aeked wheth
er they had any clews which would lead
to the detection of a possible crime the
police said although they had made care
ful inquiry they could find no one who
had seen or beard of Mr. Arbuckle.
Roundsman McLaughlin found him in an
uuconscious condition in a vacant lot.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. ly.â Frank P.
Arbuckle's home was at Highlands, a
suburb of this city. He married Miss
Emma Bwift of Fond dv Lac, Wis., who,
with two sons and a daughter, Mrs. A. N.
Darrow of Denver, survive him. He was
a telegraph operator at Russellville, where
he went six years ago Irom his native
City, Erie, Pa., and afterward became
â¢ctive in politics and returned to Colo
rado. Under the first Cieveland adminis
tration Mr. Arbuckle was appointed land
officer at Laraar.
He was president of the Denver Water
Works Company. He perfected and suc
cessfully operated the Beaver brook Water
Company and the Mountain Water Com
pany, which supplied the citizens of High
lands, and the Denver-Highland- ElÂ» ctric
Company. He was appointed Receiver of
the Land Office at Denver under the pres
ent administration. Mrs. Arbuckle left
Denver last evening to join her husband
in New York, where they intended to re
main a month. He went East just after
the election to close a large minins deal.
OMAHA, Nebb., Nov. 19.â Mrs. Frank
Arbuckle, whose husband was found in a
dying condition in New York this morn
ing, was a passenger on the Union Pacific
train that passed through this city at 4:45
p. m. to-day. Bbc said that ehe had re
ceived the news of thÂ« death of her hus
band at 11 o'clock in the morning, a tele
gram having been sent to her on the train
by friends in Denver.
Mrs. ArbacKle said that she would con
tinue on her way East, but there had been
no arrangements for the funeral, nor had
she given the Bubject any thought as yet.
She said that her husband and Mr. Fiegel
had both urged her to come to New York"
and spend some time there visiting, and
this she had intended to do when sha left
Denver yesterday, but she doubted if she
would remain in New York but a few days.
The interment will probably be in Denver.
Mr. Arbucklo, his wife said, was in the
best of health when she last heard from
him. The particulars of his death she
gleaned from the press dispatches, ile
has visited New York several times a year,
she said, and usually stopped at the Fifth
avenue Hotel, but ti is time he stopped
with his friend, Mr. Piegel.
-CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 19.â Frank P. Ar
buckle, the Denver mine-owner and poli
tician, who was found dying on Eighth
avenua under circumstances pointing to
murder, was known to every member of
the local Mining Stock Exchange.of which
he was an associate since its organization.
On the local exchange Mr. Arbuckle con
trolled the Cripple Creek and Central City
Company, of which he was president,
the Delaware Chief mine in Gilpin County,
and he held a large block of Medinau
mine shares.
ERIE, Pa., Nov. 19.â Erie relatives and
friends of Frank P. Arbuckle received
their first news of his death through the
United Press dispatch. The deceased was
an Erie boy and left this city in the '7O's.
News of his death came as a severe shock
to his father, W. S. Arbuckle, aged 82
years, and Mrs. Arbuckle, 80 years of age.
The deceased was a brother of ex-Collector
of the Port Richard Arbuckle.
GAVE PROPERTY FOR LOVE.
But Courts Decided It an Invalid Bargain
and the Widow's Daughter Gets
the Estate.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 19.-A Times
special from .Atlanta, Ga., Bays: Miss
Leonora Dean, a pretty young maiden,
has succeeded in breaking a sale of prop
erty made by her mother, a widow, to her
lover under circumstances of peculiar in
terest. Mrs. Lola Marshall Dean, the
mother of tne young woman, was a woman
of great beauty and decided literary abil
ity. When her husband died he left her a
fortune of $15,000.
For several winters she passed her time
at a Florida resort, where she made the
acquaintance of S. M. Pinkham, a well
known hotel-keeper and local politician,
with whom she became desperately enam
ored. Pinkham appears to have been
likewise 6mitten, but when he pressed his
suit he was met with the objection that
the fair lady bad made a promise to her
dead husband that she would never marry
again. She decided, however, that their
love should be of a platonic kind.
This was not quite warm enough for
Pinkham, who thereupon began paying
his respects to another lady in a neighbor
ing town. When Mrs. Dean heard of this
she was terribly aeitated, aud sending. for
her lover, promised him that if he would
not visit her rival for a space of eighteen
months she would deed him her property.
The lover was more practical than senti
mental and quickly accepted the proposi
tion, whereupon the lady made out formal
deeds and reciting a nominal sum as the
consideration, put him in possession of
her estate. Shortly afterward died,
whereupon her minor daughter brought
suit for the recovery of the property.
There was considerable latitude in the
discussion of the case, it being claimed
tnat an undelivered love like Pinkham's
wa9 not sufficient collateral for so much
property. Tne jury took tti3 view of the
case, and returned a verdict declaring the
deeds to be null and void and restoring
the property to the young eirl, who has
fought so hard for it.
SWAMPED IN BAD INVESTMENTS.
Banker Farwell, Who Is Now in Europe,
Left Much Worthless Paper
Behind Him.
BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 19.â The Herald's
Faif mount (N. ti.) special says: The
banker, John L. Farwell, of the Sullivan
County Institution for Savings, now in
Europe, has left $1,000,000 of largely de
preciated or worthless paper behind him.
Mr. Farwell handled money for a large
number of depositors and investors and
the cash, it is said, was sunk in worthless
investments in Western land and stock
speculation. The bank was closed re
cently by the Commissioners.
Since Mr. Farwell's departure for Europe
many cases have been found where be
loaned money on Government lands pre
empted by men who skiDped away before
the first interest was due. He worked
through a Nebraska banker, whose guar
antees he accepted as sufficient.
Tlie Bank Commissioners have found
that this "banker" would guarantee any
thing, from a sandbank to a bunch of
alfalfa, that he could raise a mortgage on.
Sullivan County depositors have hun
dreds of thousands of dollars of his wo'th
less guarantees. It is thought Farwell
will never oe seen in Claremont again.
AGAINST DUAL MEMBERSHIP.
Knights of Labor Decide That Workingmen
Should Not Belong to More Than
One Organization.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Nov. 19.-The
delegates of the General Assembly of the
Knights of Labor settled an important
question this morning, that of dual mem
bership. While it xloes not affect all
trades it affects that of the brewery worK
insmen, the members of wuich generally
belong to both the Knifhts of Labor and
the American Federation or Labor. A
year ago the Federation decided their
members could net belong to other labor
organizations, and to-day the Knights fol
lowed suit so far as the brewers are con
cerned and decided that they must with
draw from either one or the other.
The Knights voted this afternoon not to
put the free coinage of silver plank in
their preamble. The idea of adopting this
plank originated with General Master
vVorkman Sovereign, but the Knights
thought by its being put into the pream ble
it would bar from the organization all
who were not free silverites. The discus
sion occupied the greater part of two days.
A pian for the adoption of a new canal
system was t>re=ente<i in behalf of District
Assembly No. 49 of New York. The idea
advanced is that the Government should
have control of all the canals between the
Atlantic and Pacific, tne object being the
betterment of the system and to compete
with the railroads. A strong declaration
against the National banking system was
presented and the Knights condemned the
system.
The committee on law reported on
propositions from various districts to re
duce the executive board to three mem
bers. The proposition was lost, several of
the delegates having gone home, and it
was not possible to get the necessary two
thirds vote ou the question.
The section of the constitution that pre
vents the formation of a compulsory bene
ficiai society within the Knights of Labor
was struck out, leaving no "rule against
such formation.
The question of settlement of a general
and local assembly was raised by the in
sertion of the following words: "Provin
cial Rational trade associations are sov
ereign in their own jurisdiction in trade
matters and no appeal can be taken in
their decisions in such disputes. Joint
district boards shall be formed in all lo
calities where contiguous districts exist."
The Cold Blast Feather Company of
Chicago was placed on the unfair list.

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1596.
JOHN R. GENTRY
CHANGES OWNERS
Auction Sale of the King
of the American
Turf.
Lewis G. Tewksbury Secures
the Famous Pacer by Bid
ding Up to $19,900
Other Racers of Less Note Are Also
Disposed Of at What Is Con
sidered Fair Prices.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 19.â Before
the largest crowd ever seen at a horse sale
in this country, and after a most sensa
tional auction, John R. Gentry, the cham
pion harness horse of the world, passed
into the hands of Lewis G. Tewksbury of
this city for $19,900 at Madison-square
Garden to-night.
It was 8:30 o'clock when the band which
was stationed over the main entrance of
the garden struck up "Hail to the Chief,"
and Gentry was with difficulty brought
through the crowd to the front of the auc
tioneer's stand. The whole section of the
west side of the garden boxes and reserved
seats were as full as they could hold, while
inside the ring and on the miniature track
the throng of people were pushing and
falling over each other in their efforts to
get a glimpse of the pacing stallion.
Twenty-five thousand was a low estimate
of the number present.
"When the horse was fairly in front of
Auctioneer Bain of Lexington, Ky., who
sold him here last February, when Wil
liam Simpson was the purchaser at $7600,
the barm ceased playing. It- was not,
however, until the police was called that
Bpace was made, barely sufficient for the
horse to move around in.
A cheer went up from the crowd, and in
a few well-chosen words the auctioneer
called for bids for the champion harness
horse of the world, who has paced the
three fastest heats ever accomplished â
2:03^. 2:03Â»Â£. 2:o3^â has lowered the bar
ness record to 2:ol}^ and, to crown his
glory and indelibly stamp himself lord
and king of the turf, had covered a mile
in 2:00^, a second faster than any other
horse ever accomplished the distance in
harness.
Bids came in with snch rapidity that the
auctioneer could scarcely keep track of
them. Four, six, eight, ten and eleven
thousand dollars were offered from differ
ent parts of the house with scarcely
breathing time between. But the real
bids were to come wnen the struggle nar
rowed down to two â Louis W. Wormser
ana Louis G. Tewksbury, both New
Yorkers. Mr. Wormser came into the
ring at $12,000, his bid being delivered in
a louJ clear voice, and the crowd ap
plauded. Promptly Mr. Tewksbury went
$500 better. Tnus the battle waged be
tween the two without a moment's hesita
tion up to $16,000, which was Mr. Tewks
bury's bid, then there was a pause followed
by a round of hand-clapping from the
audience, which had been worked up into
a state of excited admiration. The ap
plause greeted Wormser's jump to $18,000.
Scarcely had it died away when the other
combatant came at him with his favorite
rise of $500. There was another short
pause and Wormser shouted $19,500, being
a raise of $1000; no reply followed for a
moment and the tension could be felt.
"What is bid?" avked Mr. Tewksbury.
'Nineteen thousand live hundred dol
lars," was the reply.
"Then I raise it $400."
Tne. auctioneer turned to Mr. Wormser
expectantly, but there was no reply, and
on the third call the auctioneer's gavel
fell. The gallant son of Ashland Wiikes
and Dame Woodstock, Jike the thorough
bred he is, stood the pressure of the crowd
admirably.
With Gentry. Robert J (2:01Â«^) and
Mascot (2:04) Mr. Tewksbury has a stable
of phenomenal greatness.
The rest of the borseÃ sold to-day
brought fairly good prices.

JUMPED FROM A TRAIN.
Pursuit of a Desperate Convict by a Fool-
ish Warden Ends in Both Being
Fatally Injured.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 19.â A desper
ate attempt for freedom, which resulted in
the loss of two lives, was made this morn
ing near this city. A gang of sixteen
convicts was being conveyed from Erie,
Pa., to the Western penitentiary at AUe
ghany City, to which institution they had
been sentenced for various offenses. The
men were handcuffed and were in the care
of Warden McCrea and Deputy Geibel.
All went well until a point eleven miles
from this city was reacned, when Patrick
Cronin, who was sitting near the door,
suddenly sprang ui>, dashed through the
doorway and jumped from the raDidly
moving train. He had evidently been
working with his handcuffs until he had
succeeded in getting his hands free, for the
irons were found under the seat that he
had occupied.
His escape was so unexpected that the
officers could do nothing to prevent it.
They saw him leap from his seat and the
next moment they saw him huddled up on
the track, where he had fallen.
Auother moment and without waiting
for the train to slow up Warden McCrea
jumped from the train in pursuit of
Cronin, and such was the speed of the
train that be, too, fell as he struck the
ground.
As soon as possible the train was stooped
and backed, and Deputy Geibel hurried to
the assistance of his chief. The two men
were found lying close together on the
track. Warden McCrea was unconscious
and blood was flowing freely from numer
ous cuts in his body and about his head.
Cronin, the prisoner, was conscious, but
was very badly hurt.
The two men were placed on the train
and were brought to Aileghany City. Am
bulances were summoned. McCrea, who
was still unconscious, was taken to the
Jerome Hospital, but he died before
reaching that institution. Cronin was
taken to the Western penitentiary and
now lies in the hospital of the prison.
The doctors say that there is no hope of
his recovery.
Cronin was a desperate man. He was
on his way to the penitentiary to serve
five years for trainrobbery.
CORN EL IUS VANDERBILT IMPROVING
Chauncey Depew Says the New York
Millionaire Will Soon Be Able to At
tend to Railroad Business.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 19.âChaun
cey M. Depcw to-day gave out the follow
ing statement:
"Cornelius Vanderbilt is improving
every day in health. He is not attending
to the practical details of the vast business
of the railroads with which he is identi
fied and will not until he fully recovers.
He is in touch with the business, however,
and has full knowledge of all important
matters connected with it as they arise.
There are the most cordial and confiden
tial relations between the brothers, Cor
nelius and Wiliiam K. Vanderbilt, as
there have always been. William K. has
done whatever has been necessary in the
management of the road since his
brother's illness, and he will continue to
represent the Vanderbilt interests until
his brother has fully recovered. Cornelius
Vanderbilt, his family and friends be
lieve, with the rest and freedom from care
he is now enjoying will in due time fully
recover and resume his former position,
not only in business but In the charitable
and religious work in which he has been
so active and efficiei t."
BURNING TWELVE TEARS.

Ohio ( onl Minr.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 19.â A special
from Columbia, Ohio, says: A question
that was referred to Attorney-General
Monnett yesterday by Mine Inspector
Hazelton disc oses a remarkable situa
tion. Twelve years ago during the great
miners' strike, mine 139, at New Straits
ville, ownen by John Elliott of Znnesville
and operated by the Great Vein Coal
Company, was tired. It was abandoned.
Recently the discovery was made that
the coal has been burning ail these years
and threatens, unless extinguished, not
only to communicate to other mines but
to let many houses drop through the thin
roof. Elliott, the owner of the mine, will
be asked to put out the fire, and there

FIERCE DEBATES
IN THE REICHSTAG
Practices in the German
Army That Must
Cease.
Herr Lenzeman Declares That
the Government Shou'd
Beware.
Revolution May Be Threatened by
the People if Reforms Are Not
Promptly Enacted.
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 19 The de
bate on the Radical motion in regard to
the practice of dueling in the army and
the case of Lieutenant Baron yon Bruse
witz, who recently murdered Herr Sieb
mann in a cafe in Carlsruhe, was resumed
in the Reichstag to-day. Herr Heller, a
Bavarian deputy and a lawyer, defended
the procedure of the military courts,
which he admitted might be amended.
He was not prejudiced in favor of it, but
the procedure gave every defeudant a fair
trial.
Herr Heller denied the statement made
on Tuesday by Herr Bebel that the Public
Prosecutor always presided over military
courts.
Herr Rickert said he was indisposed to
hold the army or the army system respon
sible for tne act of Lieutenant yon Bruse
wiiz.
Egen Reichlin-Meldegg, a Bavarian
army officer and deputy, protested against
the attempts of the Radicals to compare
the Bavarian military institutions with
those of Prussia, in order to make the
latter appear miserable. The German
army, he said, ought to be one, and it was
desirable that the same system of pro
cedure should prevail everywhere.
Herr Lenzeman, Richterite Radical, said
that the German people had waited long
enough for reforms aud they must now
press them without delay. He deplored
the fact that tne debut of General yon
Gossler, Minister of War, had been such a
lamentable failure. [Laughter.] He gave
an instance of the tendency of a military
education in the story of a recent recruit,
who, upon being asked who were the in
ternal foes of Germany, replied, "Civil
ians."
Herr Lenzeman concluded by saying
that the Government must beware. If re
forms are longer withheld the nation
might have to resort to a Voiksmothwehe
(a people's self-defense action).
Some one on the public benches called
out "Revolution i" whereupon Herr Len
zeiuansaid: "I want to avoid a foreign
word, but if you like it I will call it 'revo
lution. " [Tremendous cheering from the
members of the Left.]
General voii Gossler, Minister of War,
made a feeble reply, which was only
partly heard above the frequent interrup
tions by jibes, laughter, etc., in which he
said: "If you continue your attitude
against the army, beware. If the army is
now silent its irritation is increasing."
Dr. Schonstedt, Minister ol Justice, ad
mitted that the army dueling code must
be reformed, but defended the Govern
ment as trying to do the best thing it
could under the circumstances.
Count Burbach followed, making a
fierce attack upou Herr Lenzeman for
having, as he alleged, gone beyond the
latitude of speakers In the House and
threatening the country with revolu
tion.
FOSTER IN HONOLULU.
Said to Be Study ing Hawaiian Affairs
With Reference to Annexation of
the /stands.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Nov. 12.â Hon.
John W. Foster and wife arrived on the
2d, and are at the Hawaiian Hotel, having
declined private entertainment by Minis
ter Damon. It is believed that Mr. Foster
is here for the purpose of studying Ha
waiian affairs with reference to annexa
tion. He has been more in conference
with L. A. Thurston than any one elae,
which has led to the surmise that be is
concerning himself about the cable project
of Colonel SDalding, whose attorney
Thurston is.
Royalists are making great efforts to
impress upon Mr. Foster the necessity of
taking a plebiscite of the native Hawaiians
before annexation is considered. To
certain German planters who oppose an
nexation Mr. Foster has staed bis opinion
that if annexation should be rejected the
treaty of rpciprocity will not long be con
tinued. One planter replied that he
would rather lose the advantages of recip
rocity than to lose the cheap Asiatic labor,
to which annexation would put an end.
It is substantially ascertained from the
new census that the population ot the
islands reaches 110,000, an increase of
20,000 in six years.
Japanese laborers are pouring in at a
rate wnich is more gratifying to Asiatics
than to white residents.
Something has at last been learned of
the much-desired record of the swindler
J u lien 1). Hayne, who recently figured in
Honolulu as editor of the Hawaiian. He
led a successful career of fraud in 1889 in
Roanoke, Va., and from 1890 to 1892 in
Bucnanan, Va., where he became a social
and business leader, finally decamping
with everybody's funds and eloping with
Julia Gabbot, whom he married and soon
deserted in Chicago. He appears to nave
come from Kingston, Jamaica. In 1894
be married the widow Brush of Osage
City, whom he deserted alter robbing her
of $40,000 or $50,000. The last heard of
him was in an advertisement from a Halt
Lake hotel, which he defrauded of $400.
Hayne robbed his Honolulu iriends of
about $3000. He ia a fine-looking man,
with rare powers of fa cination.

bride and her mother, lost ail their cloth

Was One of the Most Beautiful Women
on the Stage in Her Day.
PARIS, France, Nov. 19.â Mrs. Scott
Siddons, the celebrated actress, died here
to-day.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 19.â Mary
Frances Scott Siddons, an accomplished
actress and one of the mot beantiful
women on the stage in her day, was a
lineal descendant of the great "Tragic
Muse," Mrs. Siddons' father, William
Young Siddons, being the son of George,
the eldest son of Mrs. Siddons.
Mrs. Scott Siddons was born in 1844 in-
India, where her father was a captain in
the British military service. Upon the
death of her father she returned to Eng
land with her mother and settled in Som
ersetshire, where they remained several
years. She was then sent to Bonn, where
her education was completed. It was the
custom of the institution where she was a
pupil to give dramatic performances at
the close of the term. The young girl wit
nessed a performance of "Altholie" on one
of these occasions and at the close of tne
play asked permission to taue part in the
next per;ormance, which was granted.
Six months later she made her debut in
Germany and her performance was re
markable.
On leaving Bonn she took up her resi
dence at Winchester, where, at the age of
17, she met Lieutenant Scott, a young na
val officer, to whom she was married in
1862. She made her debut in 1866 at the
Theater Royal, Nottingham, in the char
acter of Portia, in which her famous great
grandmother also appeared on the stage.
She made her debut on the London stage
as Rosalind and achieved the greatest suc
cess of her career.
In 1868 Mrs. Scott Siddons came to this
country and made her debut as a reader
at Newport, 11. I. in October of the some
year she gave successful readings at Stein
way Hall, New York, and finally made
her first appearance on the stage in this
country at the Boston Museum as Rosa
lind. For fifteen years past she has lived
in retirement.

Counter Affidavit*.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 19.â Miss Emma
C. Cox and the Bishop family, which were
charged by affidavits in the Federal court
yesterday with exerting influences hyp
notic and otherwise over the young woman
to effect her dismissal of a suit against P.
C. S. Reed of Los Angeles for an account
ing of her father's estate, presented their
side of the case to-day in affidavit form to
the court. Miss Cox asserts that all
charges of influence are false, and that the
charge that she fled to Buffalo with
Charles C Bishop, a married man, is
maliciously fnlse. She says she is living
here upart from the Bishop family aud
sticks to her petition for dismissal of the
suit, whidi sne declares would never have
been begun but for the false representa
tions made by her mother and others
against Dr. Reed. Miss Cox's statements
are pupported by Oms A. Bishop and his
son Charles, the elder explaining that he
acknowledged the signature of the girl to
her petition for dismissal at her request
and without civing her any advice.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 19.â For six sne

Shasta's Defaulting Treas
urer Given a Ten- Year
Sentence.
Affecting Scenes in Court During
the Last Act of the
Proceedings.
R cital cf the Prisoner's Former Char
acter Brings T ars to the Eyes
of His Friends.
REDDING, Cal., Nov. 19.â The last act
in the trial of William Jackson, Shasta
County's embezzling Treasurer, was
brought to a close this afternoon at 4
o'clock. At that hour the one-time
"watchdog of the treasury" was brought
before the bar of justice for embezzlement.
The fact that Jackson was to be sentenced
was kept a secret and no spectators were
present but a Call reporter and Democrat
reporter.
As befitted the solemn scene that was to
take place the courtroom was dark and
presented a gloomy appearance. Ths pris
oner was brought forward, looking Dale
and haggard, and when the sentence had
been passed upon him his face wore an ex
pression of relief that it was all over, it
was the most solemn courtroom scene that
was ever witnessed in Reddinp. The pros
ecution, conducted by District Attorney
Rose, the reading of the complaint by
Deputy Clerk Cunningham, and the sen
tencing of the ex-Treasurer by Judge
S ceney â all three old-time friends and
bosom companions of the defaulter â was
Indeed a painful duty and not a dry eye
was noticeable in the courtroom. During
the reading of the compiaint Jackson ap
peared cool and somewhat collected, but
when it came to pleading Jackson broke
down and his ro:ce grew so husky that the
word "gulity" was hardly audible as it es
caped his lips.
After the plea was entered Attorney
Smith, for Jackson, announced that they
would waive time for sentence, and asked
that tne commitment be made out for San ;
Quentin prison.
Judge Sweeney recited the facts of the
case and asked Jackson if he knew of any j
reason why sentence should not be im- j
posed. At this Attorney Smith arose and !
dwelt on the past good character of the ;
defendant; the fact of his having replaced
the money since his arrest, which was not
necessary and which he could not be
made to produce; also of his saving the
county the cost of a lengthy trial by plead
ing guilty at this time. These facts were
related by Smith as mitigating circum
stances in order to lighten the sentence,
but Judge Sweeney, while explaining the
duties of a Judge in sentencing a criminal
?"â Â»* painful to the judicial officer, and
that ia this case, owing to the long ac- i
quaiutance, etc., it wa3 particularly so,
still, he said, to conform to his line of
duty he could .Â»ee no ottier recourse than
to give him a sentence of ten years in San j
Quentin prison.
Jackson seemed to stand it fairly well, |
and after shaking hands with the few I
sympathizers present he was escorted to i
bis ceil in the ja I. He will leave here in
charge of the Sheriff Tuesday night to
serve his time in San Quentin.

BIG DEAL IN HH.AATA MISES.
Sat tern Cmpttmttwtm JTUI Develop Them
"ii a Large Scale.
REDDING, Cal.. Nov. 19.â A sale of
mining property which will be of untold
benefit to Snasta County and Redding
took place this morning in this city, by
which mining claims that are known to
be rich in gold, but which have never been
'.developed to any considerable extent,
were disposed of to a wealthy company of
New York State, who intend to develop I
and work them on the large scale which
their known wealth certainly deserves.
W. B. Murdoch, a mining expert and
also owner of the claims, conducted the
Bale of the property, wnich is the cele
brated Sybil group of quartz mines, situ
ated in the French Gulch mining district, j
and comprising the Monterey, Louise, I
Rosa and numerous other claims. A
lease of the property had been held by ,
William Brown, but the lease recently !
expired, making the sale possible. In- j
formation of this large transfer was '
obtained from Murdoch himself, still that i
gentleman stated he did not feel at liberty j
to give the purchase price or the name of j
th* company.
The purchasing company is said to be <
backed by great wealth and with its inten- !
tion to develop the property on -a large |
scale, the sale conducted to-day certainly I
means a great thing for French Gulch i
in particular and Shasta County in
general. From all accounts of the
merits of the property "the new owners
have made no mistake in their purchase,
and when great wealth is laid bare on this
property, as it certainly must be worked
on a large scale, with extensive machinery,
etc., the mining realty of Shasta County,
and in fact of all Northern California, will \
riÂ»e in vaiue, central good times prevail '
and we shall have a taste of the "days of '<
old, the days of goldâ the days of '49."

creased since Monday and is falling in tor- {
rents to-night. The rapid ri-e in the |
creeks has been the means of quite a num- !
ber of accidents. H. A. Van Amringe and
R. B. Stevenson, liquor and cigar drura
irers of San Francisco, came near being i
drown- d on their way to this city, between !
here and Cononwood, last night. They I
â were trying to make time and therefore i
were pushing on la*t evnlng, after leav- j
ing Cottonwood, despite the fact that it
was raining hard and had been doing so
for twelve hours. Before reaching Ander
son they had the horses swimming several
times, and on one occasion had to jump
out and swim themselves.
After a long &enes of misfortunes, dur
ing which they several times despaired ot
saving the team, they finally wound up
by getting on n blind road, ran into a
uitch and broke the axle of their bupgy.
This compelled them to camp out the re
mainder of the nk'ht in the rain and mud.
When the morning light finally appeared
they succeeded in getting the services of a
blacksmith and having their nonrepaired,
reachine thi city in the afternoon. They
were nearly exhausted on arriving here,
and consider t emselves extremely fortu
nate in getting out alive.

FRESNO'S MISSING MAN.
Uneasiness as to the Whereabouts of
Clark E. Wood, Under Bonds on an
Embezzlement Charge.
FRESNO, Cal., Nov. 19.â N0 one knows
the whereabouts of Clark E. Wood, who
is under $3000 bail to appear in court for
trial whenever wanted on a charge of em
bezzlement, which he is alleged to have
committed while chief ceputy in the
County Clerk's office several months ago.
There are rumors that he has departed
with the intention of never returning, but
his bondsmen are having no fears iv the
matter. Before Wood left he went to Dis
trict Attorney Snow and stated tliat he
had a position at railroading offered him
in Montana which he woald accept if
allowed to leave the State. He said he
would return for trial whenever wanted.
Wood has twice been tried on the embez
zlement charge and both times the jury
disagreed. The District Attorney has
given ud hope of securing a conviction,
and he wilr therefcre have the case dis
missed. He told Wood he could go to
Montana if he couid get employment, and
I that the case would not be brought up for
I trial at least for time. Whether
j Wood went to Montana or not Is not
i known. The last beard of him was when
: he was in San Francisco a few weeks ago.
I But as he will not be wanted for trial
! again his bondsmen are not trying to
i locate him.
Wood embezzled $000 while acting as
I commissioner in a foreclosure sui".. The
money was placed in bis charge, but he
failed to turn it over. He was at tuat time
! chief depuiy in the County Clerk's office.
! Wood fled to the East when demands for
the money were made upon nim, but after
a few weeks he returned and gave himself
; up. He was lormeriy a leading politician,
I and it was through friends that raised
money to employ the best local attorneys
to uefend him that he was finally got out
of the difficulty. That the way of the
transgressor is hard is amply proved in
i Clark Wood's case. Once be was a popu-
I lar and highly successful young man, who
I had the brightest prospects before him,
j but now he has hardily a friend in thecom
| niunity. Since he has been out on bail he
! has proved himself very ungrateful to the
! friends he had.

SJIXTA JiOSA CAPTURE.
Thought to Be a 3lodettt> Crook Wanted
for Embezzlement.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. 19.â A young
man going by the name of Harry Patter
son was arrested here this afternoon for
the crime of embezzlement alleged to have
been committed in Modesto. The accused
man has only been in this city about ten
days, but has . succeeded in gaining the
confidence of the members of the Chris
tian church, of which he claimed to be a
member. He also sang in the choir and
affected great interest in temperance
work. These manifestations of piety were
the cause of his arrest, as the description
receive) from Modesto poinied out with
great minuteness how the swindler had
gained the confidence of tne people there
and what he would probably do at his
next stopping place. The personal de
scription of ibe Modesto crook fits the
man arrested here to a dot and the officers
are confident of having captured the right
man. He s about 25 years of age, speaks
with an English accent and is a smooth
and plausible talker. A telegram received
to-night from the Modesto officers says to
hold ihe suspect by all means as he is un
doubtedly the right man and if so a dan
gerous coi:Ddence operator.
CARSON'S assavlt CASE.
Editor Sam Davit Declines to Promeeute
His Assailant-
CARSON, Nev., Nov. 19.â The assault
by the United States District Attorney
yesterday on the editor of the Appeal
grew out of a charge made by the Appeal
that the attorney feared to proceed with
the prosecution of the Coffin contempt
case, and also charged him with neglect
of duly and general ;esal i-icoia! etence.
In an editorial this morning the Appeal
reiterates the charges, but the editor de
ciines to resort to legal means to protect
himself from further assault and refuses
to swear to a complaint. Dr. Guion, how
ever, at the request ot citizens, has noti
fied the authorities that he will swear to
the complaint, and a dozen witnesses of
the most reputable character have offered
to testify that they saw the assault made
with brass or stÂ«el knuciles and a aix
shooter. The question of jurisdiction has
been raised, and the local authorities are
conferring with the United States authori
ties regarding the matter, as the assault
was committed by a United States Gov
ernment officer in front of the Postoffice,
on ground belonging to the Government.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1896.
ARGUMENTS IN
THE MOORE CASE
District Attorney Bell's
Elcquent Plea fcr
Justice.
Closely Reviews the Chain o!
Evidence Against the
Prisoner.
At'.orney John T. York Follows for
the Defense â Prosecution to
C:o;e To-Day.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 19.â Court reconrened
; this morning and the trial of Wililam
; Moore was continued. District Attorney
I Bell made an eloquent plea to the jury for
the prosecution, speaking substantially as
follows:
If it please the court and gentlemen of the
j jury, we should congratulate ourselves upon
nearing the close of this case, and ior a cai-e of
this magnitude we should not complain of the
time that has been consumed in it. Thi6 is the
j most important trial that has ever been held
j in the county of Xapa. It is an unusual thing
i for twelve men to be drawn from the body of
' the county for the purpose of passing upon
the issue of murder. It is true we have had
I such cases here before; but the prominenceof
the victim in this case and her husband, the
deep atrociousness of the crime, the utter wan
t tonness and malignity shown by the assassins,
! place this charee at the head of all crimes that
have ever been committed in our immediate
vicinity. And now, as we approach the close
j of his trial, the duty devolves upon me as
I your District Attorney and as the representa
j tive of the people of the State of California
in this action to di>cusa the evidence
that has been produced before you in this case
and to analyze the testimony of the witnesses
and state to you my views, whether you act
upon them or not, as to what I think shou.d
be accepted as true or what should be discred
ited as false. At this time, in order that we
may give this case the attention it c.a ms at
our hands and deserves, we should lay aside
| every other consideration that may arise, lay
| aside all other business that may come in our
; minds and concentrate every faculty and our
| entire attention upon the one great momen
tous question that confronts us, and it seems
to me we can better understand the circum
stances attending the terrible killing of Mrs.
Greenwood on that fatal night if we will for a
few moments forget the scenes here in court
I and turn back the hand of time for a peroid of
| nearly six years and take a view of the home
> of the Greenwoods on two days and a night in
; the month of February, 1891.
The District Attorney then graphically
j pictured that home before and after the
I assassins had entered, and continued:
In discussing this case I shall try to be as
I fair to the defendant as I am to the people
< whom I represent I will discuss the evidence
; and take it up in its logical order.
The District Attorney then brought lor
i ward in a masterly manner the evidence
i introduced by the prosecution He ex
plained and narrated again the terrible
events of the night of February 9, 1891, as
told by Captain Greenwood on the wit
ness-stand. The testimony of the other
witnesses was then referred to by Mr. Beli
| substantially as follows:
Hugh Kei'y, on tne following morning, dis-
J covered Mr. Greenwood wounded by the road
; side, and went to the Greenwood nouse and
saw the dead body of Mrs. Greenwood ljing on
! the bed. Sheriff McKenzte corroborated this
testimony. Drs. Pond aud Haun of Napa and
Professor Price of San Francisco examined the
organs of the stomach of Mrs. Greenwood and
found positive evidence that Mrs. Gretnwood
had been poisoned. Peter Lynch related how
Moore had worked for him.
Fred Stemmle related how on the eighth day
of February he purchased from Schmidt a sil
ver watch formerly owned by Moore. Stemmle
also identified Moore as the man being with
Schmidt in Vallejo on the eighth day of Feb
ruary, 1891. H. L. Amstut* identified the
watch as one repaired by him in December,
1890, at the request of Mr. Lynch, who 6aid
the watc!i belonged to William Moore. Sev
eral wltr.e-.ses along the Va.lejo read testified
that Schmidt and Moore, or men answering
their description, had passed up the road
toward > apa on the day of February 9. Mrs.
Holland positively Identified the defendant ai
the man seen on that day. Jake Shorer and
others identified Moore as the man who went
to the German house on the nigntof the mur
der. George Knox related how Moore, a short
time previous to the murder, had possessed a
battle of chloroform, the bottle similar to ihe
one seeu by Captain Greenwood on the night
of the murder. He also testified that the pis
tol discovered under the bridge was formerly
owned by Moore.
The District Attorney then referred to
the motive that bad prompted Moore in
making the confessions to W. B. Schaug
and others, saying that remorse of the
prisoner had been the prompting motive.
He referred to the confession itself, say
ing that no one but the person who had
participated in the murder conld narrate
so accurately what happened on that
awful night. The District Attorney elo
quently closed his argument to the jury
by asking that justice be meted out to the
prisoner at the bar.
At the conclusion of the argument by
the District Attorney, John T. York made
bis closing argument for the defense, in '
which he said:
We appear fu'ly realizing the importance oi
thU case, realizing that the defendant Is a
man irom the lower walks of life, without
money, influence and friends. In criminal
cases a defendant fs innocent until proven
guilty. How much more is this true in a case
where a man's life is at stake. He must oe
considered innocent until proven guilty be
yond a reasonable doubt. There has been
strong circumstantial evidence introduced in
this trial against the defendant, but this chain
of evidence cannot be stronger than iv
weaken 'ink.
Mr. York referred to the good reputa
tion and character of the defendant while
working in d.fferent parts of the State,
and then spoke of the mental con! i ion of
defendant when he made his alleged con
fessions.
Mr. Beerstecher then closed on the part
of the defense by a most eloquent p:ea to
the jury. He referred to the prisoner's
good character, to his mental condition
when making the confessions and to the
inconsistency of the confessions to the
real facts in the case.
Mr. Gesiord will close for the prosecu
tion to-morrow morning.

REIGN OF TERROR
AT VANCOUVER
Freed From Vags Only to
Be at the Mercy of
Footpads.
Ten Hold-Ups in One Night in
Different Parts of the
City.
The Ãbiquitous Tall Masked Man,
With Gun and Knife, Causes
Consternation-
VANCOUVER, B. C, Nov. 19.â Citizens
of Vancouver, B. C, have been terrorized
for months by a gang of burglars and
sneakthieves, from which they have only
recently been relieved by the adoption of
vigorous methods on tne part of the po
lice officials and the ordering out of town
of every "vag" upon whom they could lay
their hands. Now they are being visited
by an even more dangerous phase of ter
rorism, carried out by masked highway
men, who. with revolver and knife, way
lay pedestrians on their way home at
night or early in the morning.
One night this week ten men were held
up in different parts of the city and made
to stand and deliver to their assailant all
the loose change they had on them.
A party of four well-known citizens pass
ing about midnight on one of the niostl
central streets, were suddenly pounced
upon by a tall man wearing a mas&, who,
with a knife and revolver, ordered them
to produce their money, and having
obeyed were ordered to proceed on their
way.
Last night two musicians, on their way
home from performing in the orchestra at
the theater, were met by the same indi
vidual, according to the description, and
relieved of several dollars of loose change.
From a miner the sum of $70 was secured,
and an Italian who had courage enough to
resist the demands made upon him by his
assailant, was shot twice, and is now lying
in the hospital in a dangerous condition.
The Italian says that when he refused
to pay up the highwayman threatened
him and he grappled with the unknown,
who promptly fired at him twice and
leaving him prostrate on the ground
departed, cursing the unfortunate man.
The people here are becoming seriously
alarmed, and unless vigorous steps are
taken by the police to meet this new
emergency a vigilance committee, which
was spoken of during the burglar scare,
will probably be resorted to.
The tall highwayman was quite jocular
with some of his victims, informing them
that he was broke and took this means of

NOSES THATCHER EXPELLED.
The Mormon Apostle Excommunicated for
Seeking Election to the Un.ted
States Senate.
SALT LAKE. Utah. Nov. 19. -Hon.
Moses Thatcher, candidate lor the United
States Senate, who incurred the displeas
e ure of the high officials of the Mormon
cnurch for running for a public office
without their permission, was tried to-day
by the church dignitaries for insubordina
tion and refusing to hearken to the voice
of the church authorities. Mr. Thatcher
was not present and ignored the whole
proceedings, aud the ten apostles who
were his judges unanimously decided that
Thatcher be severed irom the council of
the twelve apostles and that he be de
prived of his apostleship and other offices
in the priesthood, and a public notice to
that effect was published this alternoon in
the Deseret News, the official organ of the
church. The News and the church of
ficials keep up their opposition to the
election of Thatcher to the Senate on the
ground that bis candidacy is based on his
opposition to the churcu and that his elec
tion would be a reward for opposing the
church in exercising authority over its
members, wiiich in the eyes oi the Mor
mon church dignitaries i 3 a heinous
oSense.

ATTEMPT ED SUICIDE
Turns on the Gas aud lakes Morphine,
*" but JV'of Allowed to Hie.
-SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 19.â A man about
30 years of age,- who on last Saturday
registered at the St. James Hotel as George
Warner of San Francisco, attempted to
commit suicide this evening by asphyxia
tion and an overdose of morphine. Warner
made careful preparation for the deed by
stopping up f -all*- the air passages to his
room, taking the morphine and then going
to bed and placing a rubber tube attached
to the gasjet to his mouth.
His plans were, however, frustrated by
the customs of the management of the
hotel who did not turn on the gas in his
building until almost dark and after the
morphine had taken effect. The escaping
gas was detected by the attaches of tie
house, who forced open the door and alter
hours of labor resuscitated the would-be
suicide. It is thought that Warner is an
assumed name, as the man destroyed all
possible means of identification except an
Odd Fellows' button in his- coat. He is
tail in stature, has a clean shaven face and
Grecian features. He will recover.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1896.
STANFORDS OFF
FOR THE SPRINGS
A Week in the Mountains
Before Tackling
Berkeley.
Captain Fickert Says the Trip
Will Put New Vim Into
His Men.
Great Rivalry Among Aspirants for
Bone-Breaking Positionsâ The
Probable Line-Up.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
19- â As was first announced in The Call,
the Stanford football men will leave for
Congress Springs to-morrow morning at
9 o'clock. Exclusive of Coach Cross and
his assistants, about thirty men will he
taken to the mountains for their final
week's training. When interviewed to
day Captain Fickert said:
"I am counting a good deal on this week
in the hills to improve the fellows. I al
ways felt much better after going up to
Woodside last year and the year before.
All the men seemed to liven up and play a
snappier game. Constant practice in the
same place each day for several weeks get?
monotonous and a man can't do himself
justice. ' He needs a different air, different
diet and change of surroundings, and this
we hope to get at Congress Springs. I
have never b en up there, but understand
it is an ideal place for training, with hot
and cold spring baths and all facilities,
which were lacking at Woodside." \"
When asked about the prospects for
winning, the big Stanford captain inti
mated that Berkeley wouldn't win in a
minute anyway, and that the Stanford
team would score another victory herself
this year if hard practice nnl conscien
tious playing could accomplish anything.
. The team will not be fully selected
until a day or two before the game.
There is a hot. right going on between
Jeffs and McLaine for the position of left
end. with chances considerably in favor
of the former, who besides playing a
strong, fast game has the advantage of a
j year's experience on the Varsity eleven.
McLaine didn't turn out until about the
first of November, but he has put up a re
markably strong game from his first even
ing's play. He is cool-headed, speedy and
a hard player. He tackles, in eood form
and is a valuable addition to the list of
players.
There is another hard fiebt over left
halfback. For a time it looked as though
Searight, a new man, had the place; then
Dole's playing improved so rat. idly that
be was placed at the half, and in the last
games, he played before injuring himself
he made it evident that he v. as the most
promising man for the job. Both these
candidates met with accidents last week
and are now recovering. Whether they
! will get over their strains in time to re
i cover Varsity form is a question. If they
do it is. probable that Dole will make the
j team, if they do not Lou Freeman '99. or
' \ Parker '99, will have to fight the thing
out. Both. men are .Rood u.ilis an I are
showing better form wit every practice.
Without doubt the line-up will be as
follows, with possibly the position of left
half:
! Center Williams '97
| RiÃht guard Carle '9B
! Left guard Flckert (captain) '9B
Right tackle Thomas '97
Lett tackle Hhrriugton '98
. Right end.. Straight '97
I Leu end . JafTe '93
I Quarterback Murphy '00
I Right ha1f...;...:.......:.. Fisner '9B
Left ha1f....... ...Dole '08
â¢ Fullback Cotton '98
â  Substitutesâ Center. Burnett and Bigelow;
guards, James and Adams; tacklers, Rice ana
Robinson; ends. McLaine and B. Thomas;
quarterback, Mclntosb; bucks, Freeman, Par
ker, Seanght and Jost.
Notwithstanding the rain, the men were
j out in force this evening and an interest-
I in;? practice game was played. Captain
Fickert says that rain won't be allowed
to prevent practice each evening.

Football ></>Â»<7.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Ncv.
19.â La&t evening three boxes at the Cali
fornia for the Stanford entertainment
Thanksgiving night Â»old for $62. The sale
of seats was very heavy indeed, and the
entertainment is bound to be a financial
success. Great expense will be incurred
to make the entertainment an artistic suc
cess as well. The students have begun to
assemble each evening to practice the col
lege yells and college songs. Several new
cries will be sprung on Thanksgiving day
at the game.
The prize of $10, offered by the football
management for the best football song,
Has awarded to Wallace Irwin '00, for his
song "When Stanford Begins to Score."
Following is the chorus ot the prize song
to the tune of "When Johnnie Comes
Marching Home," which gives an idea of
its character:
When Stanford bcÃins to score, my lad 3,
When Stanford beeins to score.
We'll split the sky with our rollicking cry
And yell till the echoes roar J
And we'll teach old Berkeley a trick or two
That heretofore she uevcr knew,
And we'll make short work oi the gold and blue
Wheu Stanford begins to score.
The executive committee of the student
body has appointed John M. Swiizer '98
to the vacancy on tbe intercollegiate de
bating committee. Tbe committee lias
also decided to defray expenses of the
Stanford band to the Thanksgiving game,
and is now considering the advisability of
purchasing the uniforms lor the members
of that organization.
BORKIAG FOR SAN PEDRO.
Strong Evidence to Present to the Deep
Harbor Commission.
LOS ANGELES Cal., Nov. 19â Friends
of San Pedro harbor are getting strong
evidence to present to the Harbor Com
mission when it comes to this city. Much
ot it is new and convincing against the
Santa Monica project.
They say that at Santa Monica since
last year the sea has run so high that It
was necessary for vessels to cut loose from
the wharf aud be towed out to sea in or
der to avoid damage by beine dashed
against the piling. On another occasion
a vessel was dashed against the piling and
lashed to and fro by the waves so violently
that several bents on tbe wharf were torn
loose. Losses to vessels have been nu
merous and will be included in the matter
by the San Pedro forces. The general
action of the elements and their effects at
the two i laces have been considered and
will be of materisl aid to the commission.
KJILEIt JBX t LECTRItJITY.
Streetcar Conductor Receives a Fatal
Shoe<e nt a Telephone.
LOS Ai*GELEB. Cal., Nov. 19.â C. C.
Odell, a conductor on the electric street
cars, was killed by an electric shock re
ceived while telephoning to-night. He
was at the end of the West Lake division
and had gone to telephone to the dis
patcher. HÂ« was heard to sliriek and awn
to fall back several feet to the ground.
When bystanders reached him he was un
conscious and died in about a minute.
About ttie same time S. B. Smith, an
other conductor, bad both hands burned
and received a shock while telephoning
from another place. C. Sebastian received
a severe shock when holding the telephone
about ten minutes before Odeil reached it.
It appears that a hiphlv volted electric
light wire was burned in two at the corner
of Second and Spring streets, and one end
dropped on to the telephone private wire
used by the streetcar company and
charged it. About that time Odell and
others started to use the instrument. The
reason for the two distinct shocks at the
West Lake division instrument probably
was because of the electric lisiht wire
swinging and coming in contact with the
telephone wire several times.
LIBERAL RELIGI OUS CONGRESS.
David Starr Jordan Among Those
Chosen as Directors.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 19.â At to
day's session of the American Liberal
Religions Congress, a proposition was
made to change the name of the congress
from "American Congress of Liberal
Religions" to â¢'Liberal Congress of Relig
ions.'' There was much objection to
this modification of the word "Liberal,"
but it was decided to change the name to
"Liberal Religious Congress."
The discussion of tiso ' question as to
whether the congress should do missionary
work, in the ordinary acceptance of that
term, resulted in a decision to confine the
congress to the parliamentary idea. Local
organizations will be encouraged and even
assisted, but not under the supervision of
the congress. Hiram W. Thomas was re
elected president of the congress, and
Jenkin Lloyd Jones was re-elected sec
retary. Leo Fox was again chosen treas
urer. The three men are all from Chicago.
Those elected vice-presidents are: T. w.
HigL-ins, E. G. Hirsch, A. J. Savage, R.
H. Newton and Professor Momerie.
Among the new directors chosen are David
Starr Jordan, president of Stanford Uni
versity, California, and Edwin S. Mead.
The next congress will be held at Nash
ville next year during fhe Tennessee cen
tennial celebration. An attempt will be
made to raise $500 to carry out the project
of making the Nashville congress an
unusuaily successful one. This congress
adjourned this evening.
SHOT DOWN' BY DETECTIVES.
Action of Vfflcr* That Will Cause
further Bloodshed.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 19.â A Sun
special from Williamson, West Virginia,
says: Two more killings have been added
to the lon* list of deaths by violence in.
this county in the past few weeks. De
tectives W. S. Bevins and Clark shot and
killed James and Anderson Mounts at
Delomre yesterday afternoon.
The officers were trying to arrest them
for murder commuted by Anderson
Mounts in September, and their stubborn
resistance resulted in their being killed.
Anderson Mounts shortly before ha i been
arrested for some minor offense and at
the time of the killing was in the custody
of bis father, James, who was acting as
guard. Under these circumstances the
action of the officers is a serious matter
and they at once fled. In thirty minutes
fully a score of the Mount*, heavily
armed, were in pursuit of the officers, bent
on wreaking summary vengeance. It is
likely that more than one man will meet
his death before the inceused relatives
o: the dead men capture the officers.

FEARFUL FLOODS
OF THE NORTHWEST
General Devastation Along
the Great Northern
Railroad.
Bridges Are Washed Away and
Many Miles of Track Under
Water.
Graphic Description of the Appalling
Situation by a Reporter
From the Scene.
SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 19.â The con
dition of the submerged CcÃur d'Alene
country grows more serious each day. A
reporter of the Spokesman-Review just
returned from there tells of some remark
able e-capes, and vividly describes the
condition of the country. He left Wallace
on Sunday, but when the train was out a
few miles it was flagged by a farmer just
as it was on the edge of a bridge which
had been washed away. The water was a
foot deep on the trace, and the reporter
waded through this for several miles.
Finally, on account of the high water,
be was forced to take to the foothills. At
one place he lound a large bridge washed
out, but the ties and rails were still in
place, the ties being held together by the
rails and spikes. Though a dangerous un
dertaking, he started to crawl across the
river on this weak structure. The water
was raging below and filled with all kinds
of debris. He bad- scarcely reached the
other side when the lrail structure on
which he had crossed fell into the water.
All the wagon bridges between Wallace
and Wardnsr are out and several railroad
bridges are entirely gone. At Kingston
the people were huddled together in a
schoolhouse, the houses are all afloat.
The situation at Cataldo is even worse
than at Kingston. The town is completely
submerged and there are no boats. In
the second story of one house eighteen
people are huddled together, their hogs
and chickens occupying the lower part.
A portion of tne cookhouse at the sawmill
has been washed away, with a new steel
range and three quarters of beef. The
Northern Pacific bridge is sprung thirteen
inches out of place, and 100 cords of drift
wood or more is lodged against the center
piÂ«r.
At the month of the St. Joe River Tues
day a log jam at the trestle of the Oregon
Railway and Navigation bridge was
blown out with dynamite. The Georgie
Oakes spent the entire day yesterday in
clearing away the jam at the mouth of
the Coeur d'Alene River. Cameron's
lumber-yard at McEnaville is entirely
washed away and for over 100 yards the
railroad tracks are standing on edge like a
picket fence. Great losses have been
suffered by the meadow farmers. The
entire crops of hay have been washed
away, together with barns, outbuildings
and homes. The Northern Pacific, be
tween Mission and Wallace, is all washed
out and boxcars are floating in the water.
The food supply in Coeur d'Aiene is short,
but so far there has been no actual suffer
ing. It will be some time before provisions
can be taken in.
The Georgie Oakes will make a trip to
the Mission to-day, but it will require
several weeks to get the railroads in con
dition to carry passengers from the Mis
sion to points east. At Harrison the
small sawmill-owners are employing men
to go out In boats and rescue logs, and
the men are making $10 to $15 a day.
Thousands of feet of logs have broken
away from boons and Cocur d'Alene Lake
is full of drift, presenting the appearance
of a slough. The water is as yellow as
the Lower Missouri. The lake rose a
foot aud a half Tuesday.
The Bunker Hill and Sullivan mill is
turning out more concentrates than at
any other time in its history, and on ac
count of thn shortaee of cars the concen
trates will have to be piled up beside the
track. The same condition exists at the
large mines on Canyon Creek. In some
places the Northern Pacific track lies on
top of the Union Pacific.
This is the first freshet at this time of
the year in the Cceur d'Alenes since No

SEATTLE, . Wash., Nov. 19. â Edwin
Hall Warner, a civil engineer, who re.
turned from ; the Cascade flooded district
to-day, replying to a question as to the
condition of the Great Northern road,
said :
. "Is the road open? I should say so

through every opening. How did I get
here? On foot, of course; forty -five miles
in less than forty-eight hours, besides

have never seen so general a disturbance
anywhere. It will be Wednesday next at
the earliest before any connection at ail
can be made â perhaps a day or two later.
A truss bridge two miles east of Sultan is
batily out of place and it will take as
much time to get by as if it had been
washed out bodily. From there to Index
the embankment has been washed out
every other mile or so for distances of
twenty to fifty feet. Above Index the
same series of small washouts occur.
"At Granite Cut and beyond it, distant
five miles from Index, the track for sev
eral hundred feet has been com
pletely carried away. In the cut the bal
last has been washed out, leaving only the
rails and ties.
"At the crossing of the Skykomish the
truss bridge and approach have been car
ried out, leaving something like 300 leet
across the main river to be taken care of.
Above the Skykomish several structures
were carried away and a slide or two will
have to be taken care of. Superintendent
Riton is wasting no time, and on his ac
tivity I base my estimate ot s yen days to
make the connection. To get the road in
the shape it was a week aeo will require
at least sixty days.
"The cause of the trouble was fif
teen days' snow, last. Thursday evening
a Chinook wind and then a warm rain
lasting until Saturday night at 10 o'clock.
The run-off was, as usual, in torrential
streams, extremely rapid, and everything
was carried before them. I measured the
rainfall for two days in the mines in Miller
River district. It amounted to 14 inches
In fifty-four hours â equivalent to about
abcut one-third the annual precipitation

CALIFORNIA MAIL ARRIVES.
first Since Last Saturdayâ Great Loss
to Lumbermen.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 19.â Two days'
California mail, the first since Saturday,
was received in this city to-day via the
steamer Kingston from Tacoina. The
railroads are still badly crippled by reason
of the floods. It will probably be several
days before connection can be made from
Seattle with the Northern Pacific main
line at Puyallup. The Great Northern
announces that it will have its coast line In
operation to-morrow or the day after and
that an effort will probably be made on
Sunday to resume passenger traffic over
the main line East.
The passengers hemmed in for so long
on the Great Northern between Welling
ton and Madison, it is stated, have been
rescued, and are now making their way
back to Spokane and on to Seattle over
the Northern Pacific, via Tacoma.
Lumbermen of this city say that 90 per
cent of the shingle bolts cut in Northwest
ern "Washington have been swept down
the various rivers and put to sea, and
from 3,000,000 to 5,000.000 feet of logs
driven throuuh the booms and sent the
same way. Probably one-third of the logs
will be recovered from the sound, but
millmen believe it will not be possible to
save any of the shingle bolts.
MURDERED HER OWH CHILD.
Peculiar Scandal in Which a Reformed
Preacher Is Implicated.
UNIONTOWN, Pa., Nov. 19.â The dis
closures attending the arrest of Rev. Mr.
Fitzgerald, Miss Emiline Freeman, tier
father, William Freeman, and her brother,
Dawson Freeman, all well-known resi
dents of Masontown, has caused a great
sensation in Fayette County. Miss Free
man was arrested yesterday and is in jail
charged with murdering a child to which
she recently gave birth. Rev. Mr. Fitz
gerald is held under heavy bail, and the
girl's father and brother are charged with
conspiracy to conceal the murder. The
matter was brought to public notice by
Dr. Edmund O. Cloud, who was called to
attend the girl. Emiline Freeman con
fessed to the physician that she hhd mur
dered the child and that Rev. Mr. Fitz
gerald was the cause of all her trouble.
The father and brother of the girl at
tempted to coerce Dr. Cloud to silence, but
he refused to criminate himself and made
the information aeainst the family. Rev.
Mr. Fitzgerald came from Virginia a year
ago, since which time he has been preach
ing in the Reformed Brethren Church and
boarded in the Freeman family. Miss
Freeman is 23 years oi age ana pleasing in
appearance.

OREGON PRODUCTS
FOR AUSTRALIA
Portland Merchants Bid for
Trade With the
Antipodes.
Have Chartered a Steamer to Be
Sent There With a Very
Choice Cargo.
New Line Pr-J ctad, as Sin Francisco
Has Difficulty in Handling
Their Freight.
PORTLAND, Ob., Nov. 19.â An event
of unusual importance to this city and the
entire Northwest will occur next month,
when a steamship loaded with Oregon
products will leave Portland for Aus
tralia. The promoters of the new enter
prise are Davidge & Co., agents of the
Oregon-Asiatic Steamship Company. The
steamer they have secured for the first
trip is the Aswanly, a modern Vessel of
3535 tons gross regiÃter, with a carrying
capacity of 5140 tons.
While the matter of making an experi
ment in this trade has been under con
sideration but a short time, the promoters
have had no difficulty in securing a large
cargo. If their efforts should meet witn.
encouragement a regular line will be in
operation early in the year. There is a
large amount ot products of Oregon and
Washington now sent to the Antipodes by
way of San Francisco, and this trade has
grown to such proportions that steamers
sailing from the Bay City have difficulty
in handling all of the freight offered.
Oregon produces a good deal of fruit, lum
ber, flour and other truck of similar
nature that finds a ready market in Aus
tralia. With proper encouragement the
new steamship venture is sure to be a
great aid in developing a Northwest-
Pacific trade with that country.
The Aswanly will leave about the mid
dle of December, and if merchants are in
terested in securing more trade from that
country there will be- plenty of steamship*
placed in service to follow the pioneer.
The steamship is now en route to thit
port from Hiogo.
DID HE KID NAP HIMSELF?
Portland Deteetire* Discredit Dr. Ball's
Story of His Disappearance.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 19.â Dr. F. L
Ball, who for several days was supposed
to have been drowned or murdered at
Kaiama, W r ash., about fifty miles down
the Columbia River, returned to his home
in this city to-day. He repeated his
ridiculous yarn of being kidnaped, robbed
and' taken into the mountains that he
told last night when he turned up as
"found again."
Detectives simply laugh at Ball's strange
story, as the doctor did not give a descrip
tion of his assailants to the authorities at
Kalama or to the detectives when he ar
rived here to-day. It is supposed that
Ball intended to leave the country, leav
ing impression that he had committed
suicide, "but at the last moment reconsid
ered and invented the yarn about being
kidnaped. It has leaked out through a
domestic formerly employed in the house
hold where the Balls lived that there was
considerable domestic unhappiness, and
this may account for it. However, the
doctor's young wife had fully relented by
this time, anyway, and was almost hys
terical from joy over her husband's safe
return.
A CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN THIEF.
After Thirty Tears He Seeks to Make.
Jiestitution.
THE DALLES, Or., Nov. 19.â Louis
Davenport of Mosier was robbed of a grip
containing $8000 in gold dust over thirty
years ago. Some time since, realizing
that he was approaching the grave, the
man who took the money made a will,
and in this will he provided for repay
ment of the slolen money with legal rate
of interest from the day it was taken until
the day the debt shall be paid. The ill
gotten pains seem to have prospered in
his hands, but when he came to die his
conscience troubled him.
A few days ago a stranger made his ap
pearance in The Dalles and saw Daven
port. He was quickly investigating the
matter, and without disclosing who he
was he assured DavenDort that he was
conversant with all the facts in the
stranse case. As the sum of stolen money
new amounts to $27,000, by adding inter
est and by reason of judicious investment,
and as there happens to oe, strangely
enough, a mysterious '"French Charley"
disputing that Davenport lost that sum,
it is not improbable that the leeal frater
nity may engage in a nght over thÂ«
"conscience monÂ»y. "

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda made another record-breaking run
during the trip from Sydney to San Fran
cisco. The trip between Sydney and
Auckland was made in 3 days and 14
hours, or four hours better than the fastest
on record. From Auckland to Apia the
run was made in 4 days 16 hours, or again
four hours better than the record. Be
tween Apia and Honolulu the speed was
not kept up, as Captain Van Oterendorp
did not want to reach the latter port be
fore noon. Even as it was she was a day
ahead of time. On the run to San Fran
cisco the chief did not attempt to push
the vessel, but nevertheless she was off the
Farallones long before daybreak yester
day. The Alameda came in as soon as the
fog lifted a little, and at 7 a. m. she was
tied up alongside the company's dock.
Captain Â£. R. Sterling was master of
the - American ship Patrician, and he is on
his way to New York to report the loss of
bis ship. The Patrician was on her way
from Newcastle, Australia, to Lyttleton,
N. Z., when a hurricane was run into.
Sail after sail was biown away and the
decks were flooded and everything mov
able was washed overboard. The mizzen
mast snapped off short and carried away
half the mainmast. For a short time the
foreman stood and the lower topsail on
the mainmast held. Then the storm re
newed its strength and blew the lower
topsail out of the bolt ropes and carried
away part of the foremast.
The Patrician began to leak and Captain
Sterling set the American flag, union
down, at the foremast. All the boats
were gone, and just when the crew had
given up hope the British steamer Fife
'shire hove in sight. The latter lowered a
boat and took the crew off in boatloads.
Captain Sterling stood by his ship to the
laat, and when the boat was ready to take
him off the men were afraid to go along
side, as the vessel was rapidly sinking.
Finally the gallant master jumped into
the ocean and a few minutes later was
picked up and placed aboard the steamer.
Xne Patrician was abandoned on August
28 in iatitude 39.38 south, longitude 158.11
'west, and went down half an hour after
the crew was safely aboard the Fifeshire.
In speaking about the loss of his ship yes
â¢terday Captain Sterling said it was the
heaviest storm ne had ever been through,
;.nd had it not been for the arrival of the
steamer every soul on board would have
gone down with the ship.
.The accompanying sketoh is from a.
photograph of an oil painting made by
Captain sterling when be arrived in Syd
ney, N. S. W.
The remains of Kate Field did not ar
rive on the AJaire<ia, contrary to expecta
tions. Halsted & Co. had their under
taking wagon down at the steamer, but it
ha.a again to depart empty.
â¢ The Alameda brought up 450,000 sover
eigns, or aoout $2,160,000, for tne Anglo-
Californian and London, Paris and Amer
ican banks. The sovereigns will be coined
into American double eagles.
The little thirteen-ton yawl Spray and
her master and owner, Captain Slocum,
seem to be gaining a great deal of noto
riety in Australia. The boat left New
York over a year ago, ana after coasting
a^ong the eastern shore went through the
Straits oi Magellan, and finally reached
'the southern seas. While lying in the
narbor at Apia a photograph of the yawl
was taken and a reproduction of it was
given in Thk Call two months ago. Cap
tain trlocum navigates the yawl alone, and
has not even a cat to keep him company.
The Alameda brings the news that the
yawl is in Australian waters.
The Sydney Daily Telegraph says:
Henry E. Slater, a messenger at the Works
Department, has during the past week been
addressing public meetings with reference to
the forthcoming visit of Captain Joshua Slo
cum of the yawl Spray. In these ad iresses he
has made a number of charges against the
. captain, alleging that he practiced excessive
cruelty upon him in 1883. Sinter's story
summarized is that in that year, while au
officer under Captain Slocum's command he
was put in irons for absolutely no offense. He
hays that he was weighted wuh over eighty
three pounds of chain and confined in a nar
row space, in which he could neither lie nor
stand. He says he was imprisoned in this
manner for fifty-three d,.y.s and nights, and
during the whole period of his incarceraiion
received but two ship biscuits and about half
apiniof water per diem. He goes on to say
that Captuln Slocum was fined $500 at New
iork for his cruelty, and the other officers
wtre also fined smaller amounts.
Slocum admits being fined, but asserts
that it was simply a question of discipline
that made him put Slater in irons on
ooard the Northern Li K ht in 1883. He
offered proof to show that Slater and not
â¢he was to blame for the whole affair.
Ihe Spray was escorted into Bydney
harbor by a fleet of yachts, and Captain
blocum was given a royal welcome,

WILD SCENES AT A HOTEL.
Jim Neal and Hoiias Ricker F ght, and
Jere Mahoney Loses His Gold
Bepeater.
An exciting fight which attracted a
large crowd occurred last night at about
9:30 o'clock at the Baldwin Hotel. The
principals were Honas Ricker, a bellboy,
and Jim Neal, a horseman. According to
Clerk Lake of the hotel, Neal has long
been coarse and ins lent in bis language,
in the presence of ladies as well &â < men,
and for this reason he was put out of the
hotel about a mont,h a^'O.
Neal conceived that Ricker, the bellboy,
was chief cause of his being put out. Last
nignt Neal, as Mr. Lake states, came into
tlie hotel and put his feet upon one
of the handsome chairs. The watchman
invited him outride. When he got out
side he began to abuse Ricker, whom he
saw there. Ricker was plucky and began
to rain in blows on the horseman.
There was great excitement, and in the
midst of it Statesman Jerry Alahoney ap
peared. He had not more than got in
till some one plucked from his pocket his
handsome gold repeater. While inter
ested friends separated the combatants
the statesman ran helplessly to Chief of
Detectives Lees, who was at band, and dis
played the end of his chain. The veteran
detective detached Detective John Sey
mour to try and find the watch and pick
pocket.

FIFTH PIANO RECITAL.

gramme Largely Gleaned From
Chopin's Work*.
Mrs. Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler gave her
fifth recital last evening. Not much can
De added to what has previously been said
concerning her playing in a general way.
It is true, however, that each succeeding
recital develops something new which is
worth of consideration, ard the perform
ance liibt evening was no excepiion to this
rule. The programme was largely of
Chopin. The successes of the evening
were a pastorale by fccarlatti, Chopin's
Mazurka, op. 6, No. 1, and especially his
Scherzo, op. 20. Perhaps the final "Ta
rantelle, 1 ' by Liszt, may be included in the
fortunate list. At all events it exhibited
about every variety of toucii possessed by
Mrs. Bloomfield-Zeisler, and demonstrated
afresh the perfection of ncr technique.
The cantabile playing in the Chopin
Scherzo was something worth remember
ing. The audience was demonstrative,
insisting upon irequent recalls. The next
recital will be given SaÂ«nrday at 2 p. m.

TELLING SECRETS
OF THE HOSPITAL
War Between the Matron
and the Superin
â¢ tendent.
Blankets, Sheets and Pillow-
Cases Missing From the
Institution.
Mrs. Stable's Large Tennis-Fianne
Account â Nigh'-GowDs and
Lounging R bes.
Mrs. Mary E. Black, the matron of the
City ami County Hospital, came before
the Board of Health yesterday afternoon
to tell all she knew of the shrouds that
should have been used when the pauper
dead were laid out for burial. Incidentally
she toot occasion to expose some of the
secrets of the institution.
There were missing seven pairs of
blanscts, six pillow-cases and ten sheets,
which she said she served out for the use
of Dr. Stable's family when they first
came to live at the hospital. When the
Stables moved into another residence
those articles, to her belief, went with
them.
She did not take an inventory of the
things before they went away because she
had been ordered not to do so by Mrs.
Stahie.
"I told Dr. Btahie," said Mrs. Black to
Dr. Hart, "that I must go into his rooms
and take a list of the City property there.
He at first said I might do so. but after
consulting his wife he told me that sue
would attend to that."
"When did you first miss those blan
kets, slieets and pillow-cases?" astced Dr.
Williamson.
"When Mrs. Stahie and her children
left the hospital," answered the matron.
"Soon after Mrs. Stahie came she got hurt
and had to have two more pillows and
they were borrowed from the training
school. They are gone, too.
"My attention was called to the short
age in the bed linen during che weekly
distribution of the wash. The reason I
! think Dr. Stahie took the articles is that
this week I captured the ten sheets
among his laundry."
"Wuat do you mean by 'captured?' "
asked Dr. Fitzgibbons.
"I found them among his private linen
and knew them by the hospital mark.
They came to me by the mistake of the
iaundryman."
The witness stated in reply to a question
that she had been forbidden to go into Dr.
Stahle's rooms on any pretext, but just
before the family left she found many
articles of hospital bed linen lying among
( their baggage.
Sbe explained that there was consider
able friction between herself and the
Biahles, and that it was caused by the
very official part taken by the superin
tendent's wife. She then stated that Mrs.
Stahie would maice demands upon her for
muslin, flannel, safety-pins and other
articles which she had charge of as ma
tron.
Mrs. Stahie would use the things thus
procured from the hospital supplies for
her own use, the witness said.
"Are you sure of this?" Dr. Hart asked
pointedly.
"I saw the cloth cut and made and worn
j by members of Mrs. Stuhle'a family." an
swered Mrs. Black. "I saw Mrs." Stahie
wearing a dress made of tennis flannel
whicli she got of me."
The witness stated further that some
silk was ordered for use in the internes'
room and a portion of it was used to make
a dress for Dr. Stahie s little girl.
Mrs. Black exhibited her books, espe
cially the six pages of the accounts de
voted to the requirements of Mrs. Stable.
They run from October 21, 1896, to April
29. 1896.
"Here is an itemâ -'seventeen yards Can*
ton flannel,' said Dr. Hart. "What is
that for?"
"Night clothes for little Roland Stahie,"
answered Mrs. Black.
"And here is founeen yards tennis flan
nel. What is that for?"
"A lounging robe for Mrs. Stable. 1 '
"Here is fifteen and half yards tennis
flannel. What is that for?"
"A lounging robe for Mrs. Stahle's
mother, I think."
So the long list runs throuch six pages
of a large folio account-book â flannel, linen,
creton, thread, cotton, needles, pins, etc.,
all for Mrs. Stahie. On one pa>:e are a
number of articles marked, "Taken in my
absence and not accounted lor."
Mrs. Black stated that somebody had
tried to get at her books in her absence,
consequently she kept duplicate accounts.
She consulted her attorneys for fear she
would be accused of taking the missing
articles.
Sophia Stromberg, one of the chamber
maid-, was sworn and gave pretty much
the rame tsstimony.
Edward Tornalty, the cook, testified re
garding the quality of the meat furnished
the hospital, and during his testimony
stated that the Market Inspector had not
been at the hospital for three weeks,
though he should visit the institution
three times a week.
He also said that chickens received at
the hospital as a delicacy for the superin
tendent s table were charged for as meat
for the hospital, a fat, fine broiler being
equivalent to thirty-four pounds of beet.
The steward had often carried cooked ten
derloins to favorite patients, but that was
no concern of bis.
Dr. Stahie was sworn and denied every
item of the accusations made against him
by Mrs. Black. Neither he nor his wife
had drawn a yard of stuff from the
matron's stores. The ten sheets had got
into his laundry by mistake and he had
sent them to the institution himself.
Immediately upon taking charge of the
hospital he had given orders that no de
ceased patient should be buriÂ»d in a nude
condition. A shroud is provided for each
body. ThiÂ» shroud is worth about 25
cents. Dr. Hart here ordered that shrouds
should be provided for all dead bodies and
a partition be made in the hospital
morgue for the iemule bodies and that
only women be permitted to handle those
bodies.
Dr. Stahie stated that Mrs. Black was
vindictive and angry because she was not
permitted to eat at the superintendents'
table.
The Board of Health took the matter
under advisement.
CHRISTMAS PASTRY.
Bakers Will Not Distribute the Holi-
day Cake, but Drivers May lÂ»o
as 1 li.y Please.
The master bakers met in Tnrn Verein
Hall on Turk street yesterday afternoon.
Press representatives v.ere excluded.
A resolution prohibiting the presenta
tion of Christmas cakes to patrons was
passed. One baker said, however:
"There is nothing to prevent my drivers
from making a present to their customers
on Chri-tmas day if they so desire. So
long as Ido not give it or order it I am
free and can say that I nave lived up to
the pledge."
From the expressions dropped after the
meeting it is apparent that on many
routes Christmas bakery presents will be
given as usual.
The question of raising the price of
breaa was debated. One member said he
was losing $20 a day by the increase in the
price of flour. This argument was met by
another member who said he was decidedly
opposed to forming a trust in bread. It
might <io to form a trust in coal oil and
steel, but it would be poor DÂ«ilicy to form
a bread trust because, if that were at
tempted, some big syndicate from Chicago
would come out here and mate bread for
the people ai such a price that every baker
in San Francisco would have to go to the
poorhouse.
A proposition to reduce the weight of a
loaf of bread did not meet with favar.
It was the general impression that the
action on the "no cake" for Christmas de
cision was a sort of feeler to see what the
public would thinK about it. Practically
the same action was taken in regard to
branch bakeries and the return of stale
bread.
MYSTERY OP THE MORGUE
An Unknown Man Kuds His Mfc With
Poison in the Park.
The body of a well-dressed unknown
man lies in tne Morgue, and the Coroner
is very desirous of learning who he was.
The man took morphine in Golden Gate
Park and died in the Receiving Hospital,
to which he was removed in an uncon
scious condition by the park police. He
was found on the ground near the band
stand and nearby was an empty mor
phine bottle. At the hospital the doctors
stated that he must have taken all the
vial contained.
The man at some time must have been
in good circumstances, for he was neat in
his general appearance and dress. He
was about 40 years of age, 5 feet 6 inches
in height, of dark complexion, and
weighed about 165 pounds. He had dark
hair, slightly gray, and dark mustache.
He wore a dark, soft hat, cutaway coat
with a very fine blue check, pants and
vest of like material, gaiter shoes, white
sbirt and collar, and white-ribbed under
wear.
There was nothing found in his pockets
that would lead to his identification. A
25-cent piece, a 1-cent piece, a knife, key
and a blank red memorandum-book were
all that could be found in his clothes.

FIRE AS AN AID
TO SNEAK THIEVES
Fire Marshal's Theory of
Two Incendiary
Fires.
While Pec pie Rush Out of Their
Houses Thieves Get in
Their Work.
It Is an Old Eastern Trick and Was
Prrcticed Here Two Years Ago
in Big Lodging-!! uses.
The police have been making every ef
fort to capture tbe firebug who has taken
a fancy to set tire to vacant flats, but so
far without success.
Tuesday afternoon he got the key to a
vacant flat at 1-27 Harrison street, and a
few minutes after he returned the place
was discovered to be on fire. The same
thing occurred in a vacant flat at 1329 C1ay
street, Wednesday afternoon. ,
In both cases it was found that pieces of
wood and paper had been piled up in a
closet and set on fire. The flames were
extinguished in both flats before much
damage was done.
The firebug is described as a young man
about 5 teet 8 or 9 inches tall, with a Blight
mustache, of slender build. He wears a
summer suit and has a pleasant way of
talking. In applying for the keys he said
he wanted to look at the flat, as he might
rent it.
The police have been puzzled to imagine
what could be his motive for setting fire
to the flats. It was thought that he might
be crazy on fires and did it just to watch
the house being consumed, and other
theories were advanced.
Fire Marshal Towe has a theory which
has precedents to back it up. He thinks
that the younp. man is a -neaktnief and
sets fire to the flats with plunder in view.
"It is an old Eastern trick," said the
Fire Marshal yesterday, "and has been
piayed here before. The firebug is accom
panied by some of his confederates, who
hover around waiting for developments.
When the fire alarm is soundedâ very
often by himself or one of his confeder
ates â women in the neighborhood rush
out of their houses, leaving their front
doors open. Then the firebug and his
confederates sneak into the houses and
steal anything of value they can find.
"I have not heard whether the residents
on Harrison street or Clay street had any
thing stolen from their houses, but I am
satisfied that was the scheme of the young
man in setting fire to the flats.
"Two years ago' there were several fires
in Dig lodging-houses in the early hours
of the morning. Paper and pieces of wood
were piled up in a closet in each instance
and set on fire. When the alarm was
given the lodgers rushed out of their
rooms, and the firebug and his confed
erates, during the excitement, entered the
rooms and stole gold watches, jewelry and
anything else they could conveniently
carry away without being, discovered.
"These fires puzzled us for a time, but
when people reported having lost their
jewelry I came to the conclusion that
some Easterner was playing the trick
here, and I think I was correct, because
after my suspicions on that peint were
given publicity the fires in lodeing-houses
stopped.
"Last winter we were free from such
fires, but now I am afraid the same gang
has started in again, and this time they
have selected vacant flats and the after
noon as the time for setting them on fire,
because the male occupants are at their
business downtown and only the wives
and children, who as a rule like to see a
fire, are at home."
It is noted that the women of the royal
families of Europe are, on the average,
much stronger, mentally and physically,
than the men.

be proven after all.
' It should be remembered that the Ding
ley bill of last winter was killed by a vote
of the Senate striking out all but the en
acting clause and substituting a silver
measure in place of it. What is being
advocated now is the passage of a measnre
similar to that bill, and designed, like it,
to provide an adequate revenue for the
Government until a thorough system of
protection can be put into effect.
REED'S APPEAL.
In a short address delivered to the
Duluth Board of Trade on Wednesday
Speaker Reed made an appeal which
snould find a response throughout the
whole country. Spoken in a small city it
nevertheless concerns tho welfare of all
the people and should receivo the atten
tive consideration of Boards of Trado and
Chambers of Commerce everywhere.
Mr. Reed said: '-There is one thing to
which I wish to call your attention. With
the revenues of the Nation running from
$30,000,000 to $50,000, C00 annunlly below its
expenses we can never expect to hold up
our heads among the solvent nations. A
bill was introduced in Congress wnich did
not affect the tariff issue at all, but was
only to raise revenue. 1 appeal to you as
business men to investigate this matter
and create a sentiment which will result
in the passage of a similar bill."
The Chamber of Commerce of San Fran
cisco could well afford to give some atten
tion to this appeal. Interviews with Con
gressmen of all parties, published since
tho election, make it evident that it is
stiJl doubtful whether the revenue bill to
which Mr. Reed referred can be'enacted at
this session. The' matter should 'not bo
left wholly to politicians. Every intelli
gent man knows that we need a larger
revenue, and there ought therefore to be a
universal dsmaud for it.
Mr. Reed's suggestion that boards of
trade and business men generally should
endeavor to create a popular sentiment in
favor of the passage of the bill is in the
truest sense of the word timely. The very
fact that he made such an appeal shows
that he believes it to be needed and hopes
that it will be effective. Certainly the
issue is of suflicient importance to make
the attempt worth trying, and the Cham
ber of Commerce in this City could not
direct its energies to a better purpose.
It must be borne in mind that the Ding
ley bill spoken of was not a party measure.
As Mr. Reed said, it did not affect the
tariff question at all. That is to say, it
did not affect the disputed point be
tween free trade and protection. It was
purely and simply a revenue measure,
designed for the sole purpose of putting
an end to the deficit. To urge its passage,
tnerefore, would not be carrying party
politics into commercial bodies.
Moreover, it will be noted the speaker
did not suggest the revival of the Dingley
bill itself, but only the adoption of some
measure of the kind. The former bill was
not perfect, and a new measure would
undoubtedly improve on it to the extent,
at least, of providing for the sugar indus
try as weil as for wool and lumber.
Taking all things into consideration,
this appeal from the Speaker of the House
ought to receive the well-nigh unanimous
support of business men. It is certainly
a shameful condition of affairs that a
country so rich as ours should be running
into debt every year. It is to be regretted
that Congress cannot be relied upon to
enact so necessary a measure without
being pushed to it by popular demand,
but it is useless to indulge la such regrets.
Speaker Reed evidently believes that the
demand is necessary to obtain the act,
and it should therefore be forthcoming
from all the States in the Union, and from
every commercial body which under
stands the importance of the measure and
represents the trade and industries of the
people.
THE CUBAN CRISIS.
The affairs of Cuba continne to be the
most interesting feature of our foreign re
lations. It is evident that a crisis has
been reached in the war, and there are not
wanting signs that before long this coun
try may be drawn or forced into some
kind of interference in its conduct.
Spain is putting forth wnat seems to be
a final effort to crush the insurrection.
She has recently sent large re-enforce
ments into Cuba, has raised a new war
loan from her people, and shows in every
way a determination to Dring the war to
a swift conclusion.
If General Weyler succeeds in entrap
ping Maceo and crushing his force to
pieceÃ, the present war will be brought to
a conclusion, and the island will then en
ter upon another period of sullen quies
cence which will last until the Cubans feel
strong enough to renew the contest. In
that case tbe United States would not be
directly affected, and nothing more would
be aroused than our sympathies with the
conquered and oppressed people of the
island.
If, on the other hand, Weyler should
fail, there would arise the serious question
of what Spain would do next. It is clear
th*t me Ministry conid not bold office for
a moment if it should agree to make any
terms for recopnizing the independence
of Cuba. The temper of the Spanish peo
ple would not permit any wise, calm and
statesmanlike policy to be pursued at
such a juncture. The defeat of General
Weyler, therefore, would be almost sure
to bring about some desperate action on
the part of tbe Spanish Ministers, and
there are serious reasons for believing that
I they would not hesitate to embroil the
United States in war in order to find a
means of excusing themselves for their
failure in Cuba.
It is this aspect of the war that makes
the outlook serious for the United States.
Our Government has certainly given Spain
no just reason for complaint. The Cleve
land administration cannot be charged
with any undue sympathy for the Cubans.
It has, on the contrary, been so stern in
enforcing the law against filibusters that
there have been times wnen it seemed in
clined to aid Spain in suppressing Cuban
independence. Therefore if the Spanish
Government should make any claims or
demands upon the United States it would
find Congress in no mood nor humor to
listen to them, and there might be. an out
break of hostilities in spite of the seeminc
improbability of such an event.
It is for these reasons the American peo
ple take such great interest in the advance
of General Weyler. It is everywhere felt
that the critical moment has come. There
is little prospect of Weyler's success, and
it seems evident that tbe time is ap
proaching for Spain to make her last
despairing stroke. Whether it will be at
us or not is a question no man can answer.
It is well, therefore, that the people watch
tbe course of events with eagerness, and
the Government should make every effort
to put its harbors and navy in the best
condition possible for the chance of sud
den war.
SPECULATORS AND PRICES.
The charge has been frequently made
in politics that speculators in the stoct
markets control the prices of staple prod
ucts to snch an extent that they are able
to depress them while the crops are still
in the hands of the producer and raise
them after the crops have passed into the
hands of the dealers in the exchange.
Notwithstanding the frequency with
which these charges have been iterated,
they have hitherto received comparative^'
little attention from the general public.
It has been the prevailing belief that a
stock exchange did no more than regibter
the rise and fall of prices. This view
seems so ffrmly fonnded upon the estab
lished laws of commerce that no argument
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1896.
on the other side had any effect in dis
turbing it in the miuds of the great mass
of the people.
The ch|rge, however, has now been
transferred from politics to law and from
the stump to tne courts. In the elevator
controversy now being tried before Judee
Tuley in Chicago, one of the attorneys
has advanced the proposition that the big
j elevator mpn of that city were responsible
for the oppression of the wheat market
in the Jast few years, and ho claims to have
evidence to prove the charge.
The case will be watched with consider
j able interest to see what evidence is forth
coming on this point. On the face it
hardly seems possible that any combina
tion of men could be powerful enough to
; affect the price of an article of which the
j output is so large as that of wheat. Nev
ertheless, when a reputable attorney comes
into court with a claim that he can prove
a certain state of things to be true, the
; incredulity of fair-minded men must give
way to a determination to review the case
on its merits and weigh the evidence with
impartial justice.
if the attorney comes anywhere near
proving his charges, the result will have
much to do with thedeterminationof bills
before Congress prohibiting the specula
tion in what are called "futures" of staple
products. We may be sure, therefore,
that the question will receive close atten
tion from a large number of interested
persons, and it seems likely that this
much-diÂ»puted point will soon be cleared
up by the formalion of a definite and well
grounded opinion on one side or the other.
LOTTERIES REVIVING.
The crusaae waged against lotteries in
this City diminished the cvii but did not
crush it. For a time the dealers in that
unlawful traffic were frightened into
dropping it or forced to carry it on with
a degree of caution which rendered it
comparatively harmless. The fright,
however, seems to have passed away to
*ome extent, and the fakers are becoming
bold again.
So lone as newspapers of general circu
lation publish the advertisements of these
swindling schemes and announce the
drawing of alleged prizes it will not be
possible to eradicate the evil altogether;
but if the efforts of the police be backed
up by a resolute public opinion and well
aided by the better clas3 of citizens it can
be reduced to conditions far less harmful
than it is now.
The Call appeals to all law-abiding
citizens to give an active aid to the police
in the task of suppressing the swindlers.
! These fakers rob tne people by their
| fraudulent schemes of large sums of
â¢ money every year. The gold-brick swin
, die is as nothing to the lottery swindle in
I the extent of its deception and the nurn
i ber of its victims. It has been shown t>y
the poiice over and over again that most
of the so-calleti lottery companies whose
tickets are sold here have no drawings at
all, and worse still, many of the so-called
! tickets aro forgeries. This is reducing the
practice of getting money under false pre
tenses to tlie extreme limit and a man
would derive more profit from throwing
i his money into the sea than from buying
lottery ticKets with it.
An evil so insidious as that of the lot
tery sharpers cannot be effectually coped
with by the police alone. The officers
require the aid of citizens in getting evi
dence to convict offenders, and that aid
should be cordially given. A further
effort, moreover, should be made to pre
vent the publication of lottery advertising
in the newspapers. If that reform could
te effected the task of suppressing the
evil altogether would be made much
easier, since the enticements of the sharp
ers would no longer be spread before the
public and In the home, and there would
be too little prolit in the trade for them to
venture upon the risk of detection and
punishment.
THE MINERS' BATTLE.
The statement published in The Call
yesterday of J. i\ Halloran, general man
ager of the Mining and Scientific Press of
this City, was an able and lucid presenta
tion of the claims of the mining industry
upon the National Government and its
right to a representative in the Cabinet.
The statement has more tban a transitory
value and should be reproduced by the
press throughout the mining States.
Mr. Halloran points out that at the
present time there is not to be found in
Washington even so much as a responsi
ble clerk to represent the mining industry,
and as a consequence it is almost impossi
ble to get from the Government a reliable
interpretation of the mining laws. The
Secretary of the Interior will construe a
disputed point one way and the Land
Commissioner will construe it another.
The United States Government has
done less for mining than for any other
great industry, and, as Mr. Halloran
points out, we are in this respect behind
otter civilized nations. In Great Britain,
France, Germany and Russia there are
Government departments of mines and
ministers of mining whose business it is
to look out for the industry and promote
its advancement. Our Government could
well afforri to follow that example, for the
United Stales owes more to mines and
can expect more from them than any
other nation on earth.
Like every one else who has given the
subject serions consideration, Mr. Hal-
loran sees that the appointment of a Sec
retary of Mines is not to be easily ob
tained. Nevertheless, as ho says, the
horizon of the future widens. The devel
opment of the United States requires an
increasing governmental supervision. The
Cabinet in the end must be enlarged, and
it is none too early to enlarge it now for
the promotion of mining.

Letters From the People.
FAIR'S PENCIL WILL.
What It Should Teach People About the
of Howry.
' EdiUr San Fianetico Callâ Sir : It is with un
feigned .satisfaction, but not with surprise,
that I read in the leading editorial of The
Call this morning on "Currency Reform"
that ># it Is evident that one of the issues which
will be forced upon the attention of the next
Congress will be that of reforming our system
of currency," and that "the new issue will
differ from that which was appealed to the
people in the last campaign, inasmuch as it
wiil affect paper money rather than coin";
also that "the chances are thnt it wili form
the dominant issue in our politics for some
time to come. " I desire to add the single com
ment that it was In fact the dominant but
concealed issue on ihepartof the conserva
tive interests in the recent campaign, as I
stated at the opening of the campaign in a
"letter ' on the "lour money planks," though
the silver issue was t/nwise'ly, as I believe,
made paramount by the "reform forces."
Now, since paper money rather than coin Is
to be the issue in our politics tor some time to
come, would it not be a good thing for us all
to try to get at a true and really scientific
understanding of the nature of money, sc as
better to judge whether it should be issued by
the Government or by the so-called Nationul
banks? I assume that we can all come to a
study of this now dominant issue as American
citizens who desire the best form of money for
the common good of our country and the
general convenience of the public. I offer
these suggestions in that non-partisan spirit.
There are two fundamental conceptions now
fixed in the public mind as to tUe nature of
money. Our gold $5 piece has on it these
words: "United States of America; Five D."
and the figure of the eagle. On he other face,
surrounded by stars, is the symbolic head ot
"Liberty," as Indicated by words also on the
brow, with the date below the head. That is
all, and that piece of gold is $5. That is one
conception of money, though but few people
in thu whole Nation ever see the $5 piece.
They are accustomed to use the $5 ' -note," as
it is named, which is to be "redeemed" with
the metal money ii desired, but as a matter of
fact is never so redeemed in a lifetime by any
one except those who deal in monoy as a trade
or occupation, whom we call bankers. Now,
did it ever occur to the reader that the paper
money is just as good for all people ex
cept those who deal in money as a trade, a
very small part of the whole population, as the
metal money which the great mass of the
people never handle during all their lives? If
not, why not?
The now celebrated "pencil will" of the late
Senator Fair illustrates to my mind the true
nature of paper money, as do also his "p-'ncil
deeds." So much lead In & lead pencil as is
necessary to trace n few lines on a small piece
of paper, both worth the hundredth part of
one cent, will convey the title to millions of
dollars in Droperty or in money and upset all
other wills made with all due lormality. The
law does it all. The law makes his will or
wi^h so expressed all-powerful. His deed does
the same. The law maKes it so. A deed to a
lot worth $5 or $5000 conveys that property
just the same In either case, and in the same
way. In the same sense a $5 greenback con- I
veys just that amount to the holder of all
Uncle Sam's prODerty. and his word is pledged,
with his urmyand navy and the unlimited
taxing power of his Congress, to make his
word good. In a word, the Government paper j
money is the will or deed of Uncle Sam which
conveys all the gold and silver, oil the mer
chandise, ail the factories, all the railroads, all
the ships, all the farm*, all the wh?at and cot
tcn, and the cattle upon a thousand hills, to
the holder of that paper money, so far as the
face value of that paper money calls for it.
A $5 greenback is a title deed to an undi
vided interest in all the property protected by
the stars and stripes, including the gold and
silver of all theShyiocks in the land; just as
a Government bond is s mortgage upon all
snch property. In fact, a greenback is a bond
bearing no interest and a bond is a greenback
bearing interest, and both are made good by
the same Dronme secured by the same prop
erty, the same army and navy, the same Con
gress, and the same people with their valor
and their lives. All that upholds the flag is
committed to tne defense of the greenback as
well as to the bond. Bonds are better than
sold, and all the gold itself, as well as all
other property, is pledged to make the bond
good, and just so, too, t<Â» m*ke Government
money pood. Joseph Asbury Johnson.

THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.
Ak Explanation or the Final Act in thi
Presidential Campaign.
Chicago Times- Herald. .
Our Presidential electoral system is a great
stumbling block to thousands of voters who
have never studied l!, and it would probably
surprise a great many people to tell them that
neither Major, McKinley nor any else is as yet
elected President of the United . States, Yet
such is the fact.' The actual Presidential elec
tion will not take place until the second Mon
day of January next. \ '
; Whom, then, did tho people vote for at the
recent election? ; They voted for electors, who
are State officers to whom is confided the duty
of electing a â¢ President i and Vice-President.
These electors do not assemble together in one
large National gathering and there cast their
votes for the candidates of their choice, but
each body of : the State â  electors < meets â¢ at its
own State capital on s the second Monday of
January succeeding ; the < November : election
and votes by ballot lor President and l- Vice-
Presldent. Three certificates of the ballot are
made, one directed to the Governor of the
Mate, another forwarded by mail. to the Vice-
President of tne United States at Washington
President '*** by messen Ber lo the Vice
' On the following second Wednesday in Feb
runrythe Vlce-President, in the presence of
the Senate and ' House *of Representatives
jointly ; assembled,-* opens these ; certificates,
and, tellers being appointed, the -state of the
Tote Is announced. Without further declara
tion the candidates having a majority of the
electoral votea for President and Vice-Presi
dent become entitled to these offices on the
following 4:h of March.
It was the intention of the freiners of the
constitution that the electors should have
fuli power to elect whomsoever they pleased,
but since the formation of parties,. "they have
never exercised that discretion, but have
voted for the candidates the people designated
beiorehand.
The term "college," as applied to the elec
tors, is not used lv the constitution, but being
convenieut it first came into use to designate
the State electors, as, for instance, the "elec
toral coilegc" of Illinois. In recent years the
term has been extended to mean the whole
body of electors in all the States. Strictly
speaking, there are forty-five electoral colleges,
each independent of all the rest, and each vot
ing on the day appointed in its own State.

English and American Justiceâ k. H. M.,
City, it is generally admitted that the ad
ministration of criminal justice in England is
much severer than it is in the United States,
and that the magistrates are stricter
in the administration ol criminal law.
Tne statement that "cruelty to seamen
is practiced solely on board of Brit

It is to be regretted that cruelty has been
practiced on board of American ships by
American officers.

does not, so long as she resides in the United

virtue of her husband's 1 naturalization, if
she married again, and the second time to a
foreigner, would be entitled, were she living

either varnished or rubbed with a mixture of
tripoli powder and turpentine applied by

had been considerable trouble with the unem

some magnitude at Trafalgar square. On the
18th ol October a large number of un
employed gathered in Hyde Park ior
a demonstration, and the authorities
believing that mischief was meant, ordered
the police to clear the Dark. The mounted po
lice rode into the crowd, when a collision oc
curred, and after a sharp conflict the police
were driven back. The police, iearing that an
attack would be made on the snops in the^
vicinity of the park, closed the gates, locking
the crowd in. In the wild scramble to get out
a large number of people were trampled under
foot and injured.

HAD BLACK GOVERNORS.
A Curious Piece of Connecticut History
Known to Few People.
A book little known even to collectors
of Americana is a volume entitled "Hart
ford in the Olden Time; Its First Thirty
Years," by Scaeva, which was edited by
"VV. M. B. Hartley and published at Hart
ford in 1853. There is a chapter in thia
book entitled "The Black Governors oi
Connecticut," the very title of which will
excite the surprise of most intelligent
people, even in Connecticut, who have
never heard of any black Governors in
the Nutmeg Stateâ except the Governors
of an opposite political faith, who were, of
course, politically black. The title, how
ever, is explained and justified by a little
explanation.
Before the revolution and down to a
period as late as 1820, it was the custom
lor the negroes living in the State to hold
an election on the Saturday succeeding
the regular election day, choosing one of
their number as Governor. Sometimes,
however, no election was held, the retir
ing Governor assigning his otfico to
another. The man chosen in either case
was usually "of imposing presence,
strength, firmness and volubility, quick
to decide, ready to command ana quick to
flog." He appointed a staff of military
and judicial officers who executed his
orders in all matters pertaining to colored
people, especially questions pertaining to
morals, manners and ceremonies.
The fact that he had no legal status in
the province or State did not at all trouble
him or hi 3 subjects, and he appears to
have exercised a very real power, nearly
always on the side of morality and justice.
The Justices of the Peace appointed by
these black Governors were, as a rule, ex
tremely severe in punishing people of
their own color who transgressed the law.
So generally was this recognized by the
whites in colonial times that when a slave
committed some offense it was the custom
to turn him over to the black Justice for
punishment. Such a culprit always fared
much worse than it he had been tried by
the regular courts.
Among the more notable colored men
who held the office of Governor were
Quaw, a negro belonging to Colonel George
Wyllys; Peleg Nott, who belonged to Col
onei Jeremiah Wadsworth ; Boston, be
â¢longing to Mr. Nichols; John Anderson
and Cuff, who held the office for ten years.
After the abolition of slavery in Connecti
cut the custom began to pass into disuse,
and at the present time even many intelli
gent negroes of ttie State know r.o'thine of
it.â New York Tribune.
Mixed Metaphors.
The Irish have no exclusive prot>erty in
mixtures of metaphor, though their
greater imaginativeness mahes them more
naurative in speech than the common run
of Englishmen, and their impetuosity tends
to confusion. The following passage ia
from the carefully written memoirs of one
of the greatest English scholars of the
century, Mark Pattison. " Even at this
day a country squire or rector, on land
ing with his cub under his wing in Ox
ford, finds himself much at sea as to the
respective advantages or demerits of the
various colleges" (page 16); and, ot course,
Shakespeare mixes his metaphors freely.

MRS, CRAVEN SUES
RICHARD V.DEV
First Step in the Contest
Over Fair's Deeds
to Her.
It Is a Move to Quiet Title to
the Fine and Sansome
Property.
The Famous $500,000 Contract of the
Fair Chiidrea to Dey fcmt
Bj Produced.
The first gun was fired yesterday by the
legal representatives o' Mrs. Nettie Craven
in the legal battle over the deeds from
the late Senator Fair to that lady. A few
days before the pencil will was withdrawn
j it was then given out by counsel for Mrs. :
Craven that they would assert her claims j
to certain real estate in this City, for
which she holds deeds from Senator Fair.
By the withdrawal of the Dentil will tbe
decks were cleared for action, and yester
day a new contest was started whereby
still another phase has been put upon the
litigation over Fair's estate.
During the trial reference was repeatedly
made to a contract for $500,000 made by
the Fair children and placed in the cus
tody of Richard V. Dey. Dey has testi
fied that he had such an instrument in
his possession and that he would produce
it when called upon by the court to do so.
This contract was made in April, 1895, j
when Mrs. Craven was in the East to get j
the pencil will, which had been sent there
for safe-keeping. When this will was j
produced in court Attorney Lloyd stated :
that Mrs. Craven aid not want any ;
notoriety in the .Fair matter, and also ;
that the children knew she had tbe deeds. i
Then they said that if she Drought the '
pencil will here they would authorize Dey ]
to pay her the sum of $500,000, in consider- j
ation of which she was to relinquish all
claims against the estate and deliver. up
the deeds. -While she was still, away the
contract was reduced to writing and it ;
then took its present form, which is un
derstood to be a conveyance from the Fair
children to Richard V. Dey of all their in- j
terest in the property, at Pine and San
some streets, tbat having been deemed
of sufficient value to meet the $500,000 de
mand that he would have to pay.
This payment, it seems, was to be made '
conditional on the probate of the pencil !
will, but the children withdrew their sup
, port from that will and thus prevented its
, probating. Â«And now the trust convey
ance ot comes a cloud upon Mrs. Craven's
title to the Pine and Sansome corner.
Tne suit brought yesterday was for the
purpose of quieting her title as against
this claim. The complaint tiled in this
case is entitled Nettie R. Craven against
Richard V. Dey, and is as follows:
Plaintiff is now and for a long time hitherto
] has been i he owner aui entitled to poss;Â£sion i
j of that certain lot. piece or parcel of land ;
I situate, lying and being in the City and 'â 
'â  County of San Francisco. State of California, I
j and bounded and described as follows:
Commencing at the point of intersection of j
the south line of Pine street and the west line ;
I of Sansome street, running thence westerly j
' along said south line of Pine street two hun
i dred and thirty-five feet tix inches, thence at
| right angles southerly one hundred and thirty
j stver. feet six inches, . tcence at right angles
1 easterly two hundred and thirty-five feet six I
1 inches to said â west line oi Sansome street, one '
j hundred and thirty-seven feet six inches to I
j the point of commencement.
The said plaintiff claims title in fee to the
said premises, and the said defendant claims |
an estate, or Interest therein, adverse to the
said plaintiff.
The claim of said defendant is without any
right whatever, and said defendant ha 3 not
any estate, right, title or interest whatever in
said land or premise*, or any part thereof.
' Wherefore plaintiff prays (1) that the de
fendant may be required to set forth the na
ture of his claim, ana that all adverse claims
of the defendant may be determined by a de
cree of this court.
(2) That by said decree it be declared end
adjudged that the defendant has no estate or
I interest whatever in or to said land and prem
ises, and that the title of plain is good and
valid. "
(3) That the defendant be forever enjoined
and debarred from asserting any claim what
ever in or to said premises adverse to the
plaintiff, and for such other retief as to this
nonorabie court shall seem meet and agree
abie to equity, and for her costs of suit.
Delias & Shortridge,
Attorneys fur plaintiff.
In addition to this Dey has been given
notice that Delmas & Shortndge, attor- j
neys for Mrs. Craven, /will this morning
j demand an inspection of a copy of t:..e
j famous $500,000 contract.
An affidavit by Mrs. Craven was also
| filed, in which she claims that Dey had
! the contract made on or about March 16,
j 1895, and that it is necessary and material
evidence for her to have.
Her demurrer to the cross-complaint of
j Charles Fair and his sisters will be heard !
; at the same time.
Meanwhile the other side has not been
idle, for the, opposing counsel yesterday j
served notice "mat they will demand an j
| inspection to-day of the deeds made by ;
; the late Senator Fair to Mr;. Craven.

of full moon. The exposure was forty
five minutes. Tbe picture brings out the
shadows distinctly, arid sharply deiines
the rods of liie superstructure. Mr.
Warner reversed some of the accepted
notions of photography by moonlight and
obtained surprising results.
A rew years a<;o Eastern journals of
pliotograpiiy made quite a feature of a
night scene of Alrmeda Creen repro
duced by photograph. The present
bridge picture is far in advance of earlier
effortti. Tbe moon wnj not reflected on

PIONEERS ENTERTAINED.
Season Very rieasantly Opened With
What Was Called a K am 11 y Party
i ast >-venii>g. "
The opening invitation entertainment
of the season was given by the Society of
California Pioneers last evening in Pioneer
Hall. It took on mainly.: the aspect of: a
dance, with incidental refreshments, but
there were other features, notably the
singing of the Knickerbocker quartet.
Tneonly really s?t programme was found
on the dancing card.. Veterans who came
to California as early as ' 49 were present
in considerable number. There were more
"Junior Pioneers," as the young people
are called? by. their elders, than seniors,
and, in fact, the entertainment was given
largely for the benefit of the younger
people. WWtffÃrlÃ
There was not in it much that savored
, of the early days in California excepting
I the general heartiness and cordiality.
The ball was handsomely decorated with
bunting and flags. An orchestra fur
nished music for the young and old Cali
fornians who crowded into the hall,'
despite the rain. Altogether something
like 1300 invitations were sent out, every
member of the society who resides around
the bay getting two. ...
Dan O'Callaguan was tbe floor manager
and the committees were as follows:
Floor committeeâ C. T. Ryland Jr., Arthur
Bering, John Lermen. Peer Tiffany, Fred
Schmidt, Herbert Tilden, Arthur Ebbets
Jr., Ed Duisenberc and C. M. Plum Jr.

PEOPLE'S CHURCH
IS NOW DEFUNCT
Dr. Birch, the Pastor, Has
Gone to Europe for
Funds.
Lack of Local Support Caused
the Suspension of the
Services.
The Dtctor, However, Promises to
Rsturn and Put It on a Firm
Basis A^ain.
The People's Church, organized in the
middle of September by the Rev. Dr. Wil
liam L. Bircb, late of New Zealand and of
England, Eenfcs to be a defunct institu
tion. It is at ieast defunct to the extent
that its pastor has departed to pastures
new, and from the present outlook his re
turn to the work lie took up is a matter of
doubt.
Dr. Birch arrived in this City iast spring.
It is s^id that he comes from the nobility
of England, and had preached with the
noted Dr. Spurgeon. That is, when no
more people could enter where Dr. Spur
geon was speaking. Dr. Birch would ad
dress the overflow in some hall near by.
Dr. Birch will probably go to the for
mer scenes of his usefulness very soon. â 
He left this City last Tuesday evening on i
the Sunset Limited for Philadelphia and !
New York. He will visit England and !
Constantinople before he stops traveling. |
.His departure naturally gave rise to the
question. What has become of the
i*eo^le's Church? Dr. Birch opened the
services of tbe People's Church in Metro
politan Temple on September 26, and bis
iirst congregation numbered about 1200
souls, according to the estimate of one
interested. This same person estimated ,
that the last gathering, on November 8.
did not number over 500. It is doubtful
if either heure is correct.
Dr. B rch wanted his new church to be
Congregational, but as far as practicable |
non-sectarian. He desired to have a pace ,
of worship where the poor could enter free |
of all caete and feel at home and welcome.
In this movement he was ably assisted by
J. Drumgold, wlio acted as treasurer, Mra.
Murray, Mrs. E. F. Drumgoid. Ed Smith,
William Fowler, J. McLaugblin, D. M.
Reynolds and other?, who assisted in pro
viding music for every service.
Those who desired to do so contributed j
to the cau?e, but as there was no regular
churcb organization the People's Church
simply hved from Sunday to Sunday.
Thure were two men who promised a little
support, one $2 and che other $5, but that
would not run a church even it the minis

On the last Sunday in October Dr.
Birch, at tbe conclusion of the services,
invited all who wished to affiliate wiih the
People's Church to hand their names to
the treasurer at the door as they passed
out. Only thirteen, an unlucky number
apparently in this instance, presented
their names, and the nÂ»Â»xt Sunday the last
sermon vias i.elivered by Dr. Birch.
Justice must be done the man for his
earnestness and activity, for he wrote out
ar.d caused to be printed new hymns fur
every Sunday. When the printing bills,
hall rent and other incidental expenses
v.ere summed ud it w.-is found that the
People's Church was running behind at
tbe rate of $30 a week.
The lack of support was what killed the
new church. Dr. Birch was apparently
too liberal in bis views to suit the more
orthodox of bis brethren of the cloth in
this City, and those to vhom he looked
the most for aid were the least ready to as
sist.
Mr. Drumgold in discussing the doctor's
departure said that his absence is not for
very long. He is going East to endeavor
to raise funds for the perpetuation of the
People's Church in this City. Should he
fail in the East he will go to his relatives
in England, who aro wealthy, and from
them secure the necessary cash for firmly
establishing the church. His purpose is
to get this one built upon a rock that
financial storms will not disturb and then
procoeri to another city and build another
People's church. Mr. Drumgold says that
Dr. Birch will be absent from one to three
months in his quest for funds.
Mr. Drumgold in discussing Dr. Bircb.
asserted that the press was in error in
statin <; that Dr. Birch made application to
join the Piesbyterian ministry. Hisoniy
application was to the Congregational
ministry. He stated that one time iome
of tiie members of tha First Congrega
tional Church asked him to rill the pulpit
vacated by Dr. Charles Oliver Brown, but
that the Bay Conference failed to act upon
his application or pass upon his creden
tials^ The attack upon Dr. Birch's ortho
doxy may have had something to do with
bis failure to secure a call from Dr.
Brown's former congregation.
Dr. Birch deeply regretted the public
attack made on his orthodoxy and the iact
that, with the exception oJ Dr. Rader, the
Congregational ministers generally ne
glected to extend their sympathy or to af
lord him an opportunity to reply.
At any rate he did not waste much
time in worrying over the Bay Confer
ence failure to act favorably upon his ap
plication, for he went to work and started
the People's Church and then he started
for Constantinople.

WILL ACT WITH
THE REPUBLICANS
Senator Jones of Nevada
- Says He Will Stand by
the Tariff.
But the Tariff Will Not Make
Times Bstter in His
Opinion.
Only Moro Money Will Do That, and
No Money Has Been Issued in
Three Years.
United State 3 Senator John P. Jones of
Nevada is among the recent arrivals here.
He has been for some time at Virginia
City and elsewhere in Nevada, and has
not till now been in California for a long
time.
The Senator sees considerable of a fu
ture in the development of the gold prop
erties in this State. He says from all he
can learn, both by observation and from
what he knows of the intentions of invest
ors, ?t is in the mines that the greatest
profits are to De made.
"There is a better chance to make money
in gold mining than in anything else,''
said tne Senator. "So far as lam able to
judge California is in an excellent posi
tion to develop her mines. I have not
been here rong, having been in Nevada
since my return from the East, but that is
the way it looks to me. There is no money
in other kinds of business, for money can
not be made when there are falling prices.
"It is like a man climbing a ladder in
an elevator when the elevator is gowiug
down. He may think he is going up, but
lrom the nature of the case he is powerless
to get up, despite his greatest efforts.
Therefore, I commend mining, a3 business
will not succeed.
"If things go on and no improvement
results, what can we expect? As to Mr.
Bryan and hi 3 Dook, he is a very bright
young man, but what can the ablest book
accomplish? If we have hard limes for
the next four years, that will be more po
tential in changing our present system
than anything else.
"So far as the tariff is concerned I'll
support it. Tbe Republicans can count
on me, and while they are about it I
would like to csk them if they know of a
stronger tariff man than lam and have
always been. I made one speech on the
tariff, and hundreds of thousands of
copies were printed and circulated. But
tbe tariff isn't going to help us out. We
haven't got money enough. That is the
trouble. There has been no money issued
for the past three years, and we can't get
along and be prosperous without more.
"But 1 will help the party out all 1 can.
HEW TO-DAT.
A Lost Voice.
Advertising will do a great
many things, but it won't bring
about the return of a lost
voice. The best thing to do
is to begin, at once, the use of
the sovereign cure for all affec-
tions of the throat and lungs â
Bronchitis, Asthma, Croup,
Whooping Cough, etc. It has
a reputation of fifty years of
cures, and is known the world
over as
AVER'S
Cherry Pectoral.
I will put no stones in its way.
I want prosperity to come if these people
can bring it who say they know how to
do it."
The Senator will be bare for several
days.
Dixon Dismissed From Office.
A. F. Dixon, United States Circuit Court
Commissioner for Sierra, Humas and Lassen
counties, was removed from his position yes
terday by Judge McKenna. Six years ago
Dixon was appointed to that position by Judge
Sawyer. Several months ago he was indicted
by the Federal Grand Jury on a charge of ex
tortion and misappropriating funds belonging
to the Government. Dixon evidently did not
intend to bear the results of his misdeeds, for
ne at once disappeared, and the Deputy United
States Marshal, who holds a warrant for his
arrest, cannot find him.
Drank Himself to Death.
Thomas Ryan was found in a dying condi
tion early yesterday morning by tba police
and sent to the Receiving Hospital. A little
later he died and the body was removed to the
Morgue. An autopsy showed that Ryan died
from excessive drinking. He was about 50
years of age.

ARCADIAN LOVE
IN A BIG CITY
The Romance of Margaret
Buckmaster and Joseph
Hamel.
Judge Seawell's Court the Scene
of the Disclosure Yesterday
How a Man and Woman Resided
Together for Tears as Brother
and Sister.
A romance in private life was brought
to light in Judge SeaweU's court yester
day. It gave another illustration of the
adage that one half of the world does not
know how the other half lives.
The suit was entitled John C. Buck
master, as special administrator of the
estate of Margaret BucKmaster, deceased,
against Joseph Hamel.
Mr. Hamel is a solid-looking gentleman
of about 60 years, his full beard being
touched with gray, and his recital of his
life was like a chapter from a novel or a
paraphrase on one feature of Thomas
Hardy's "Jude, the Obscure."
The suit is to regain possession of cer
tain real estate on Eighteenth street, near
Mission, that was the property of Mar
garet Buckmaster during her life, which
is now claimed by Hamel as his own,
alleging title under a deed of gift dated
June 23, 1891, and filed for record August
19, 1895. The deed sets forth that the only
consideration for the transfer was tbe re
gard in which Miss Buckmaster held
Hamel, and that tbe deed was made on ac
count of "love and affection and for the
better maintenance and support of said
Hamel."
In attacking the legality of this convey
ance John Buckmaster, orother of the
dead woman, alleges that Hamel by
means of undue influence bad prevailed
on her to disinherit her relatives for bis
own benefit. The complaint also sets
forth that the said Margaret Buckmasier
at the time of her lieiuu was about 67
years of age; t at upon tbat date she was
aud for a lotig time prior thereto had been
totally blind; that her mental faculties
became greatly impaired by reason ot
sickness and old age, and by reason of the
effects of medicines and drugs adminis
tered to her during her sickness by Hamei.
and her mental faculties li.'d been so im
paired and her mind weakened and her rea
son affected to such a degree as to render
her incapable ol a prudent management of
her property and affairs.
It was further alleged that Miss Buck
master and Hamel occupied tbe s,ams
house for many years; that he was her
only companion; tbat he poisoned her
mind against her brother and other rela
tives; that he would not allow tbe brother
to see Miss Buckmaster when she was
bick, and that he had obtained the execu
tion of the deed by duress and fraud.
The court is asked to annul the deed
end distribute the estate to the heirs-at
law.
In contrast with this bitter view of the
matter, as couched in all the malignancy
of language possible in a legal document,
is the idyllic explanation that is offered by
Hamel.
"We had been friends from childhood,"
said Hamel, "and as the years went by
and it seemed that neither of us was
likely to murry, we agreed that we would
reside together as brother and sister, and
so we did. We occupied the .~ame house,
and bore to each other in honorable affec
tion the relation of brother and sister, and
no other.
"This course we took because it was for
our own convenience and comfort, and be
cause it was *ot a matter of concern with
the rest of the world.
"After the beginning of our life as
brother and sister we constantly and
faithfully performed our duties under the
agreement or contract. We shared our
earnings and our expenses. All our
money we put in a little box and when
either wanted ro use any money all we
had to do was to take it.
"In talking over our affairs we decided
to go before a notary public and make our
wills, each to wiii the other what property
we had. The notary suggested that a deed
would be better, as there was often trouble
about a will, but he thought there could
be no dispute over a deed. Each of us
made a deed, it being arranged that the
one who survived should have the prop
erty of both."
As corroborative of this a written agree
ment, acknowledged before a notary and
signed by Miss Buckmaster making her
mark, she saying she could not see well
enough to write, was introduced. In this
supplementary document it was set forth
that the survivor should pay the funerai
expenses of the other and assume posses
sion of all their joint personal property.
If Miss Buckmaster died first Hamel was
to pay out $500 as she directed.
Hamei said that in pursuance pf their
understanding the deeds were made out
and signed, and that was why he ha<]
taken possession of the property. Ho
owned some real estate of similar value in
another part of the City.
Replying to the accusation that he had
excluded the relatives from Miss Buck
roaster's presence during her sickness
Hamel told of how she changed her mind
in regard to paying out some money after
her death.
After she had been confined to her bed
for a long time she sent to Mr. Mossbach,
a notary public, and told him to change
her agreement with Hamel in regard to
certain moneys. She said "I don't want
you to give that $300 to Buckmaster. He
doesn't treat me right He doesn't de
serve it Here 1 1 have been sick in
bed for seventeen months and he hasn't
been to see me. I want you to pay
$100 to Father Stokes, $360 to Father Bren
nan, $106 to Buckmaster, that brother or
half-brother of mine, and $1 to his son and
$1 to his daughter."
Hamel denied that he had endeavored
to exclude Miss Buckmaster's relatives
from her presence, or that he had tried to
prejudice her against them.
The case will be argued to-morrow by
Attorneys Campbell and Nowlin.
A TECHNICAL CONTEMPT.
Judge Morrow Upholds the Position of a
Keceiver of a Defunct Bank.
United States District Judge Morrow
yesterday made a decree finding John
Chetwood Jr. and Attorney Knapp guilty
of a technical contempt of court. It was
in the case of Thomas K. Stateler against
the California National Bank of San Fran
cisco and John Chetwood Jr., who is one
of the stockholders. Stateler is the re
ceiver of the bank and the suit was
brought to restrain Chetwood and others
from instituting proceedings in the State
courts that would tend to tie up a fund of
$30,000 which Stateler claimed should be
paid to him as receiver. An order to that
effect was made by the United States Cir
cuit Court, but notwithstanding Chetwood
took two appeals to the United States Su
preme Court.
It was -on these appeals that the two
contempt charges were brought, and the
court yesterday decided that it was a tech
nical contempt. Judge Morrow decided
that Chetwood and Attorney Knapp
should be adjudged guilty of contempt,
and ordered that they pay the costs of the
proceedings and further that they observe
the injunction previously issued to let
the receiver and money alone and also
that they cause the dismissal in the State
courts of tiie two actions brought by them
and that they rile evidence of the dis
missal within twenty days. Several who
were complained of in the contempt pro
ceedings were purged of contempt, as they
satisfied the Judge that they had noibing
to do with the suits or appeal complained
ot
THE EVE OF BATTLE.
Fighters Now Heady for a Passage at
Arms â Julian Talks of
Corbett.
This evening Jimmy Carroll an* Jack
McAuliffe will meet in a ten-round con
test at Woodward's pavilion. The betting
last night favored McAuliffe slightly, not
withstanding the fact that Carroll is the
better trained of the two. The general
opinion is that the battle will end in a draw.
Hawkins and Finnick are in tiptop condi
tion and will certainly put up a great mill.
Hawkins is a strong favorite.
The managers of the Golden West Club,
of which Harry Lask is director-general,
has postponed the Tracey-Ryaa ten-round
contest from Saturday, tne 28th inst., un
til Monday, the 30th irst., as Ryan insists
on having tbe additional time in which to
train. Tracey is in fine condition and his
friends are very sanguine of his success,
notwithstanding that his opponent has a
great record.
Julian, the manager for Fitzsimmons,
said yesterday that Corbett is unquestion
ably playing an in and out erame of bluff.
"As a sporting man conversant with
matters pugilistic," said Julian, "you cer
tainly know that all championship battles
must be to a finish, and that is exactly
the reason why we insist on a finish fight
with this alleged champion heavy-weight.
If you refer back to Corbett's statements
which have been published in the leading
papers of the country you will find that
he stated that Dan Stuart was tl:e o:iiy
man in whom he could place strict confi
dence as regards the pulling off of fiuish
fights.
"Now Stuart can offer as good if not a
better purse than the Bohemian Club can
give and Corbett is well aware of this fact.
"Corbett has consented to the terms of
the .Bohemian Club because he thinks
that by doing so he will gain the good
will of the sporting public; but the men
who understand anything about pugilism
are well aware of the fact that a champion
ship contest Biust be to a finish.
"Now if Fitzsimmons should meet Cor
bett under the auspices of the Bohemian
Club, or any club for that matter, in a
limited contest, and Corbett should buffer
defeat, what then? Why, the papers
would come out and say that Corbett is
still the champion because the tight was
not for the championship, which means a
battle to a finish.
"I tell you that when Corbett and Fitz
simmons meet it must be to a finish, be
cause I am as anxious that F;tzsinimons
will be recognized a* the champion ot the
world as 1 am of winning a large amount
of money. The way things now look
Stuart will get the match, and you can
wager that Corbett will try every trick
known to him to avoid a finish contest.
Just wait and see if I'm right."

A FATHER'S ULTIMATUM.
G. F. Clarke, the Young New Yorker,
Surrendered Into Custody by
Bis Bondsmen.
G. F. Clarke, the young New Yorker
who was arrested some weeks ago at the
Palace Hotel on tho charge of obtaining
money by false pretenses, was surrendered
by his bondsmen, Thomas Clancy and At
torney Lawler, yesterday morning.
The original complaint against him was
withdrawn and F. A. Wheeler, the broker,
who is the complaining witness, swore to
a new complaint in Judge Low's court
and he was booked on the new charge.
Wheeler is a cousin of the younÂ« man,
who is the son of the senior partner of
the firm of Clarke. Bustinell & Co., whole
sale grocers. New York. He had been on
a tour round the world and after spending
his money lavishly for a few weeks his
funds ran short. He went to Wheeler
and got him to cash a draft for $250 on his
father. The draft was returned dishon
ored and Wheeler bad him arrested.
In the original complaint it was alleged
that Clarke falsely represented to the com
plaining witness that he was a member of
the firm of Clarke, Bushneil & Co., but in
the new complaint it is alleged that he
falsely represented he had money in bank
in New York to meet the draft.
The case has been hanging fire in tbe
expectation that Clarke's father would
pay the $250 to Wheeler. He offered to
do so, but made it a condition that his
sou would take a trip around Cape Horn
for his homeward journey instead of
going overland. Young Clarke refused to
take the trip around the Horn, and his
bondsmen decided to surrender nim into
custody.
It is stated that the young man is in
fatuated with a young woman on Stockton
street, and dislikes to leave her behind.
Clarke denies this, and says that he would
be glad to get back to New York, but not
by way of the Horn. He is not afraid of
the outcome of the case against him, as he
claims he made no false representations.
MISTAKEN FRIENDSHIP.
W. W. Campbell,! Druggist, Charged
by Mrs. Anno Jane Chiftholm With
Felony Embezzlement.
Donald Chisholm, 1159 Folsom street,
on Behalf of himself and Mre. Anne Jane
Chisholm, his wife, swore to a complaint
in Judge Conlan's court yesterday charg
ing W. W. Campbell, druggist, Ninth and
Folsom streets, with felony embezzlement.
The complaint was drawn up by Attor
ney A. L. O'Grady, who represents the
Chisholms, and it recites that on October
10 Campbell, as their agent, received $300,
which he appropriated to his own uses
and purposes.
Some weeks ago Mrs. Chisholm was rid
ing on a Howard-street car, and when the
car reached Ninth street it struck a
bumper, and she was thrown to the
ground, sustaining serious injuries. She
was carried into Campbell'* drugstore and
he sent for Dr. Field to attend to her.
Campbell took an interest in her case,
and after she had recovered he induced
her to allow him to prosecute the cable
company for damages, it being stipulated
that for his trouble he would get 25 per
cent of tbe sum obtained.
It is alleged that Campbell got $400 from
the company, but only gave Mrs. Chisholm
$25, telling her that he received less than
$100.
BELLA UNION SALOON.
The Police Couimigsioners Refuse to
Grant a License to the New
Proprietors.
The Police Commissioners at their meet
ing Wednesday afternoon refused to grant
a license to the Bella Union saloon, 712
Kearny street.
In August last, when Whittingha^A;
Mosher applied for a license, it was re
fused by the Commissioners. They then
got the signatures of twelve property
owners on the block to a petition for a
license, and the Commissioners we're com
pelled to grant it. The license expired a
few days ago, and meantime Whittlngham
& Mosher had sold out their interest to
Thomas H. Phillips and Josepn J. Casey,
and it was the application of the two lat
ter that was refused Wednesday night.
The Commissioners had reports before
them on the conduct of the saloon from
tbe policemen on the beat, and had also in
mind the action of Justice of the Peace
Groezinger in bringing the saloon to the
attention of the Grand Jury on Monday
last The Judge had listened to the evi
dence in the case of Frank Wilson, a
sailor, who was drugged and robbea in the
saloon, and retaliated by etabbiug the bar
tender, 8. J. Smith.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1896.
DOCTORS SUPPORT
DR. HIRSCHFELDER
They Say Measures Should
Be Taken to Fight Con
sumption.
All Suspected Cases Ought to Be
Examined by the State
Bacteriologists.
Dr. Firnnm Believes That the Super
visors Should Provide for Such
Officials.
The statement of Dr. J. O. Hirschfelder,
which appeared in The Cali. yesterday,
has excited considerable comment, not
only among physicians, but also among
people generally. The doctor claimed
that in a few generation? consumption
DR. J. O. HIRSCHFELDER*
[From a recent photograph.}
could be exterminated. To reach this end
it would be necessary for the Government
to establish institutions throughout the
country, wbere all persons affected with
cough or suspected of having consump
tion could be examined free of charge,
and if found to be tifflicted with tubercu
losis be treated by the Government. This
opinion was favorably viewed by other
physicians yesterday, though in some
cases the belief obtained that measures
should be taken by the locai authorities
without delay for the accomplishment of
the same object â the eradication or at
least the prevention of consumption.
In New "iork, a physician stated yester
day, the health authorities have the most
perfect system of examination for diph
theria in the world. There are many sta
tions in that city where physicians can
obtain gratis a culture tube and a steriliz
ing swab. As soon as a physician is called
to a case suspected to be diphtheria, he
sends to the nearest station for such a set,
he introduces the swab into the patient's
throat, rubs it over the interior of the
culture tube and then returns the set to
tbe station. This tube is immediately sent
to the health oflice laboratory, where it is
placed in a culture oven and an investiga
tion of the germs is made. Within
twenty- four to forty-eight hours the physi
cian receives a repoit whether the case is
one of true diphtheria or not. Although
the process is rather complicated it still
wo ks perfectly In New \ork.
Such institutions for the examination of
tuberculosis, doctors say, could be much
more easily arranged, for all that would be
necessary would be a microscopic examin
ation of the sputum, which couid be made
in ten minutes. Such instit tions, accord
ing to clearly defined opinions of doctors
interested in this new treatment and
method of attacking consumption, might
be organized by State Boards ot Health,
which should push the iietbod as the
California State Board of Health is now
distributing diphtheria anti-toxin, and so
establish laboratories for the manufacture
of the an ti- toxin of tuberculosis.
Diphtheria is shown to be a rare disease,
whereas one out of every seven individu
als dies of tuberculosis. Consequently the
claim is made that a greater necessity ex
ists for protective measures in tuberculosis.
In order that the battle with tuberculosis
should be successful every animal found
to be tubercular, so leading physicians
jay, should be cremated.
Dr. Farnum, one of the physicians who
have taken up the oxytoxin treatment
discovered by Dr. Hmcuf elder, has very
pronounced views on the suggestion to es
tablish examination stations through
which consumption might be eradicated.
"My opinion is," he said yesterday,
"that the Supervisors here ou^ht to pro
vide funds for public bacteriologists to ex
amine all specimens of sputum and other
specimens free of charge, which physi
cians may take to them for examination.
This would aid very much in making an
early diagnosis and stop the spread of
such diseases as tuberculosis, diphtheria
and typhoid fever and many other infec
tious diseases. A large number of pa
tients who call upon physicians are not
able to pay for a bacteriological examina
tion of such .specimens â the usual fee for
which is from $5 to $10 â and the average
physician has not the time to make as
many such examinations as should be
made.
"At the present day we cannot sneak
positively on the diagnosis of many caaes
of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis,
without such an examination to find the
germs in secretions or discharges.
"Something surely ought to be done to
prevent the spread of tuberculosis. I
think it would be well for the Board of
Supervisors to pass some law requiring
public eating-houses to sterilize table
ware, cups, plates, knives, etc., in process
of cleaning, either by steaming or immer
sion in boiling water. Very probably in
most cases of tuberculosis the affection is
contracted through the mouth, and no
doubt public eating-houses furnish the in
fectea material largely. There are three
physicians on the new board, and surely
we may expect something from them.
"It seems to me the spreading of the
disease could be limited to a consideraole
extent by ordinary precautions of steril
izing. It would be better to have early
provision made at home ihan to w.ait for a
Government provision. I believe that in
early or middle stages pulmonary tubercu
losis can, be cured."
MOKE ARC LIGHTS.
The Merchants' Association "Will Agi
tate the Project of Illuminating
Kfiirny Street.
The regular meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Merchants' Association was
held yesterday.
The committee on public affairs sub
mitted the following circular letter and
agreement to be sent to property-owners
along Kearny street for securing the
illumination of that thoroughfare from
Market street to Montgomery avenue by
powerful electric arc lights. After suc
ceeding with Kearny street the Merchants'
Association will take up the better light
ing of the other business streets of the
City. In fact, it is the intention of the
board of directors to endeavor to bring
about the better lighting of every thor
oughfare of the City that is largely used
by the public:
Tbe Merchant*' Association has been re
quested by a number of the leading; Kearny
street property-ou uers to obtain subscriptions
suffic.ent to pay for the illuminating of that
thoroughfare from Market street to Montgom
ery avenue, in accordance with the plan
ndopted by the merchants on Polk street
J his association has determined to use every
effort to comply with the request, and upon
receiving a sufficient subscription will enter
into a contract with the Edison Light and
Power Company to furnish twenty am lights
to be placed in the center of Kearny street be
tween the points named.
We therefore inclose you herewith a sub
scription blank and earnestly request you to
subscribe for the amount indicated and re-
turn the subscription to the office of the Mer
chants' Association immediately.
The necessity for the better illumination for
the downtown district must be apparent to
every one, and as the amount which you are
called upon to pay us is only 7 cents per front
foot per month, we feel assured that the
amount contributed by yon will be returned
many fold in the improvement which your
property will receive.
It is a well-known and generally admitted
feet that all merchants, and especially those
doing business along the line of Kearny street,
have been complaining of the dullness of
trade for a number of years, and that it is only
fair and right to ask the assistance of property
owners in the movement that this association
has inaugurated for tha better lighting of the
downtown district, which will certainly mate
rially &id in stimulating business.
It is especially desirable to have these arc
lights in>tnl!ed before the holiday season,
hence we ask you to give this matter your im
mediate attention.
Should this experiment prove successful,
this assoeiÃ ion will make strong efforts to in
duce the in ..icpality to assume or pay for all
or a p. rt ol this necessary service, after me
beginning of the next fiscal'year.
The president of the Merchants' Ass
ociation will call a meeting at an early
date of all the 'property-owners along
those principal blocks of the City that are
now paved with cobbles. There are a
number of blocks right in the heart of the
City, snch as Geary, Post and Stockton
streets, that are still marred with cot blÂ«s.
The committee on publicity and pro
motion reported that the efforts of
the association in securing the site of
the Wllmerding School for San Fran
cisco proved successful with the Board
of Regents. It was through the efforts
of the Merchants' Association that the
valuable evidence of the executors of
the will was procured, and this evidence
resulted m the selection of San Francisco.
Efforts will now be made to interest some
of our patriotic property-owners to donate
a site for this school, so that the entire
endowment with interest, amounting to
$425,000, may be devoted wholly to the
purpos â¢ of providing the school with the
necessary appliances and its proper main
tenance.
ST. PATRICK'S ALLIANCE.

England, on November 23, 1867, for at
tempting to rescue two Fenian political
prisoners.
The alliance is a beneficiary, non-secta
rian, non-political organization, giving
death benefits of $150 and sick benefits of
$10 per week to ailing members. No ad
mission lee is charged, admissions being

To Support the Entrance.
The petition of Ciaus Spreckels to be allowed
to extend the columns supporting the en
trance of bis new building on the corner of
Third and Market streets a distance of five feet
over the sidewalk was discussed by the Street
Committee, and Clerk Russell was instructed
to draw up a resolution permitting the work
desired.
Charged With Burglary.
Â£. H. Hunington and J. B. Donnelly, each 19
years of age, were booked at the City Prison
yesterday on the charge of burglary by Police
man McCottrey. They were discovered break
ing open two trunks that were stored in a sta
ble on Glasgow street.

N. P. COLE WANTED
FOR PRESIDENT
He Will Probably Succeed
Jacob Z. Davis Next
Month.
Worked Long for the Welfare
and Protection of Dumb
Animals.
Boom in tbe Membership of the So
ciety for the Prevention of
Cruelty to An ma Is.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruel
ty to Animals would have elected a presi
dent yesterday to succeed Jacob Z. Davis
had there not been so much business to
consider before the subject of election
came up. Mr. Davis, it will be recollected,
died not long ago in Philadelphia. The
board of directors sat yesterday in the
room where his picture, draped in black,
is a conspicuous object. He had long
been the leading spirit. His death occa
sioned a vacancy in the board and also
imposed upon the board the duty of elect
ing possibly two new officials â a president
and vice-president.
N. P. Cole is the present presiding of
ficer, having been elected vice-president
some months ago to succeed Ira P. Ran
kin, upon the death of tbe latter. Had
there been a little more time there is very
little doubt that Mr. Cole would yesterday
have been elected president. Nearly all
the board were there, those present being
N. P. Cole, H. Lissak, Columbus Water
house, James S. Hutcbinson, F. P. Gib
son, C. 8. Crittenden, H. E. Holms, Max
Stein, J. H. Mangels, Theodore S. Gruen
hagen and Martin Stevens. They strongly
favored Mr. Cole for the place. Mr.
rVaterbouse felt disinclined to be a candi
date. Mr. Cole also had no wish to take
the place, but all the indications are that
he is tho coming man.
Mr. Cole has been a member of the
official board of the society fully ten years
and has devoted much time to its busi
ness, having always taken a lively interest
in the work. He is the natural candidate
for this reason as also on account ot his
acknowledged fitness for the place. But
no election occurred, the matter neces
sarily going over until the next meeting.
Next to the expected election the ex
pected appearance of owners of fox ter
riers who are interested in coursing was a
leading matter of interest. The pressure
in favor of permitting the dogs to chase
live rabbits in this City and County con
tinue?. For some reason the owners of
coursing dogs did not come up in person
or through communications yesterday.
The directors had considerable routine
business to transact in addition to the
auditing of bills. The membership roll
had a boom by the addition of eleven new
members, who are named as follows: F. W.
Hinckley. W. F. Ambrose, Dr. G. N. Van
Orden, George F. Cameron, Rev. William
A. Gardner, H. B. Montague, Maurice
Schweitzer, Melville Schweitzer, Samuel
szanich, Maunce Kuttner and Frank R.
Burkbardt. This list is somewhat note
worthy. It contains the name of the sec
ond clergyman who has ever joined the
society, Rev. William A. Gardner of the
West Side Christian Church, and also the
name of the recently elected Superintend
ent of Streets. Rev. Mr. Gardner is so in
terested in tbe work that he will soon
deliver a sermon on the subject ot cruelty
to animals.
There were also inspection officers of the
society to elect yesterday, and the follow
ing were elected: J. F. Burgln, A. C.
Bauer. William Gans, Alfonse Pettit,
Henry Kleebauer, George P. Wetmoreand
A. E. Buckman. Two of these officers are
well known as street contractors, who have
excellent opportunities to see how ani
mals are treated. The reports indicated
activity upon the part of the officers.
Since the preceding report 340 cases of
alleged cruelty had been Investigated, in
volving 722 animals, of which 203 were
taken from work. There were twenty-six
arrests and eleven convictions during the
period.
BOOKS ON HOME INDUSTRY
A N>w Organization Started by the
Manufacturers and Producers*
Association.
The Manufacturers and Producers' As-
SQgiation is at present engaged in an
effort to form one grand, strong organi
zation by electing delegates to a central
body. The purpose is to work in har
mony for the peneral welfare of the State.
A called meeting was held yesterday in
the Mills building. Delegates were pres
ent from the various organizations as
follows:
State Board of Horticulture, Alfred Holman,
B. N. Rowley, E. F. Adams; Merchants' As
sociation, Charles Bundschu, Hugo D. Keii,
W. G. Doane; Chamber of Commerce, Charles
K. Allen, O. D. Baldwin, E. A. Brujjuiere;
Board of Education, Messrs. Henderson, Comic,
Soper ; Board of Health, Drs. Morse, William
son, Fitzgibbon; Builders' Exchange, Thomas
W. Butcher, James A. Wilson; Manufacturers
and Producers' Association, M. J. Keiler, L. R.
Mead, J. W. Kerr.
Julius Sonntag, president of the Manu
facturers and Producers' Association,
stated the purpose of the meeting: He
was elected chairman and C. L. C. Blethen
secretary.
"In order that you may understand
what we purpose to do for the State, if
possible," he said, "let me read you some
suggestions ironi our late manager, Mr.
Tacy, now in the East."
The ideas advanced by Mr. Tacy were
principally that textbooks on home in
dustries should be placed in the public
schools, that the lumber industry needs
greater attention, and that, contrary to
the generally expressed opinion, this
State has the finest hard wood in the
world for furniture manufacture.
The matter was informally discussed in
brief speeches by J. W. Kerr, J. Richard
Freud, Charles Bundschu and others.
The unanimous opinion was that the idea
is fxcellent.
The meeting adjourned to meet a week
from next Wednesday at 3 p. m., with the
understanding that the president and sec
retary shall in the meantime prepare a
document setting forth the plans of the
intended organization for distribution to
the various clubs and associations.
AT GREATER SPEED.
Supervisors Agree to Let the Southern
Pacific Trains Run Faster Within
the City Limits.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to recom
mend that the ordinance regulating the
speed of trains in the City and County of
San Francisco be amended to allow the
Southern Pacific Company to run its trains
at fifteen miles per hour between Third
and Townsend streets and the Valencia
street station, and at thirty miles per hour
between the latter point and the County
line. J
J. A. Fillmore represented the company
and explained that the corporation had
placed gates and bells at all crossings so
there was no danger to vehicles or pedes
trians. He stated it was the desire of the
Southern Pacific Company to reduce the
running lime between Third i\nd Town
send and Valencia-street stations from
twelve to ten minutes and between Valen
cia street and tbe County line from twelve
to seven minutes.
The reason of the desired change was
because it was Intended, at the request of
the patrons, to reduce tne time of tne trip
from this City to San Jose by eight min
utes. __

Fell street. Teleptpae - Pine " 269 i, "?* 'A CHINESE GIRL BOLDLY
KIDNAPED BY THREE MEN
She Was Stolen From an Upper Window of the
Presbyterian Mission on Wednesday
Night.
'The Girl Says She Was Mar
ried to the Youngest
Kidnaper.
NOT ME, MY BRCTHEB, SAYS HE
"Oincers Grunwald and Cullinane Nar-
rowly Escape Being Innocent
Accomplices.
The . boldest and most successful kid
naping of a Chinese girl ever recorded
in the dark annals of Chinatown history
was carried out last Wednesday nicht.
â¢Chief of Police Crowley now has two of
.the best men at his command ferreting
out the mystery.
â¢And a mystery it is, despite the fact that
the girl has been safely returned to the
Presbyterian Chinese Mission on Sacra
-1 memo street, between Powell and Stock
'ton, whence she was taken from under the
..very, eyes of the lynx-orbed matrons.
â¢ What is' more, ana the audacity of it is
etunnine, the three Chinese concerned in
the' affair after they had the girl safely
stored away, on the pretense of rescuing
tier from danger called in two policemenâ
Officers George Grunwald and James Cul-
Jinaheâ to assist them in removing her to a
better hiding-place. By a small mischance
â¢ their plans miscarried, and now the two
' officers in question are congratulating
themselves that they did not become inno
cent accomplices in the kidnaping.
As learned from several officers who
wefe reporting off at the California-street
station when the affair occurred the .facts
' are a>s follows:
â  About 5 o'clock yesterday morning
officers Grunwald and Cullinane were
approached while standing on Pine street,
near Dupont, by three Chinese. The
name of the youngest, a youth about 20
years of age, has since been learned to be
Low Yuen Yue. The next oldest was his
brother, and he wore a pair of gold
' rimmed spectacles. The third was a
much older man and the father of the
othe.r two Chinese.
The youngest, who spoke good English,
explained to the two officers that their
.sister had been stolen away from her
home, and they had located her on the
top story of a ramshackle dwelling situ
ated on Dupont street, near California.
If the officers would assist them in see
. ing her safely returned to her home his
father would pay them well for their
services. While disdaining any fee, Grun
walii and Cullinane promptly accompanied
them to the place designated.
Then the youngest man went inside for
a moment, but soon returned with a
cautious query as to where the girl should
be taken,, saying if they took her home
she might be stolen again. One of the
officers suggested that she be taken to the
California-street station.
''Well," said the young Chinese doubt
â¢inely, "I w<ll rec if she is there." - ,-
Returning in a few moments, he said
she was not to be found. The officers' sus
picions were now thoroughly aroused, and
t.hey made all three Chinamen accompany
them into the house. Sure enough, the
eirl was found in an upper room of the
house.
â¢ The whole party then proceeded to the
. California-street station, where a great
crowd of officers, just reporting in, gath
-1 ered around. A messenger was at once
.dispatched to the Chinese Mission, and
Miss Anna Culbertson, Bister of the super
intendent; Miss D. M. Cameron and a Chi
, nese girl named Ying, who acted as inter
â  preter, came hastily to the station.
They at once identified the girl as Chow
â¢ Ote, aged 15. who was brought to the
mission last Monday by her two cousins,
named r*oon, regular member* oJ the Chi
nese Presbyterian Church. Then the in
terpreter set to work questioning the girl.
She was missed at 11 p. m. Wednesday
and admitted that shortly before that
, time the three Chinese had come and
taken her from hex room in the upper
story by means of a ladder. She was
afraid to make a noise or object, she said,
for" fear of violence being used. How the
Chinese learned the situation of the room
in which she was quartered is a mystery.
Then the girl went on to tell she had
been taken away and married to the
youngest of the three Chinese, and finally
placed in the house from which she was
rescued by the policemen.
. â¢ "That's a lie! That's not true!" broke
in-Low Yuen Yue excitedly. "She didn't
marry me at all. It was my brother."
Bj other stood sedately by and wouldn't
say whether, he was married or his brother
was married, or whether any ceremony
.took place at all. But the girl -persisted
"that she had been joined in wedlock to
Low Yuen, the youngest.
As there was no charge acainst the three
â¢Chinese, they were released and promptly
skipped out. The girl, who is very pretty
according to the Chinese idea of beauty,
was taken back to the mission.
Now a warrant has been sworn out for
the arrest of the three Chinese and chief
Crowley has both G:unwald and Cullinane
specially detailed on the case. What time
they are not hunting- for the three Chi
nese they are embracing each other at es
caping committing the crime of kidnap
ing!
In police circles the utmost endeavor
has been made to keep the matter quiet,
and the superintendent of the Presby
terian Mission, Miss Margaret Culbertson,
when seen yesterday at first refused to
make any statement in the case. She was
at length prevailed upon to verify the
fects as above given.
"It is a* mystery to me how they man
aged to learn which room the girl occu
pied," she said. - "Even now I don't know
whether ihe is married or not, and, if so,
to which one.
'â¢The girl was brought to this country
when only 5 years of age and her parents
are dead." !-â â¢- â  'â ' â  ',' - "
ENGINEER MELVILLE'S REPORT.
Repair Work to Warship* Require* Ad
ditional Toot* at Stare Island.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 19.â The
annual report of George W. Melville, en
gineer-in-chief of the navy, makes tne
â¢ following reference to the Pacific Coast
naval stations:
Work was done in the steam engineering de
partment o.' the Mare Island yard to the ma
chinery ol the following vessels: Adams,
Albatross, Baltimore, Bannington. Boston,
Camanche, Concord, Hartford, Marion, Mohi
can, Monadnock, Monterey. Oiympia, Oregon,
Pensacola, Petrel. i'hijhdeiphia. Ranger,
Swalara, ThetiÂ«, Unadilla aud Nellie, aggre
gating $123,362 92. The expenditures otoer
tiian for naval vessels amounted to $83,451.
This is the only repair station on >iie Pacific
. Coast, and there are now at that yard under
L t*pair no less than seven vessels requiring
*Â°"-re or less extensive repairs ai t^r several
y k Â» of continuous commission. Tne shops
rft ill edamed to the work, and the absence of
proper tools and of a modern boiler-making
piant ia severely felt. The result is shown in
the increased cost of work done at that yard
beyond what v wouia cost it the proper tools
were at hand and properly arranged for facili
tating work. There are certain tools wl)!"'<
â hould be obtained without delay, me moil
Important being a hydraulic boiler-making
plant.
The only work at the Sydney (Wash.) station
was me small repair and preservation of the
Nipsic's steam cutlers and necessary material
and stores amounting to $1642 40. The new
dock, which has just been completed at this
place, is the only one on the Pacific Coast that
can take battle-ships like the Oregon. As
these vessels are of such draught that they
cannot go to Mare Island Navy-yard when in
need oJ repairs it becomes necessary to pro
vide for this elsewhere, and as many impor
tant repairs to the niachinery can be done only
when the ship is in dock I recommend that an
approbation be asked lor the necessary tools
to do the work which may be found necessary
when the ships are docked and for the erection
of the shops for these tools.
MAKE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS.
Mailer* of Vital Interest Considered
thÂ« national Grange.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 19.â At the
meeting of the National Grange, Patrons
of Husbandy, to-day, the report of the
committee on resolutions, which was
adopted, recommended a stable currency,
that United States Senators be elected by
the people, equal protection for the
farmers, pure food legislation, rural mail
delivery and referred to the value of ex
perimental stations and agricultural col
leges; expressed sympathy with Cuba,
and stated that the grange would receive
with joy the settlement of the vexed ques
tion between England and America. It
favored arbitration whenever it can be re
sorted to without sacrifice of honor.
A lengthy report from the committee
on railroads was made by Chairman Mer
sick recommending several amendments
to the interstate commerce law to more
lully carry out its purpose, the chief one
being that the coiuuiiitee have power to
make rates.
A resolution calling upon the coming
administration to give suitable protection
to agriculture, so that new National bur

Wan a Financial failure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 19.â
Consul Ridgeley writes the Department
of State from Geneva that the ; Swiss
National Exposition which was held there
from May 1 to October 18 was conducted
at a great financial loss. The guarantee
fund, amounting to 2,000,000 francs, has
been all "swallowed up" and- there is
still a deficit of from 100,000 to 3^,000
francs which is to be covered by the profits
of a National lottery to be drawn the last
ot this month. The financial failure of
the exposition was due entirely to the un
precedently bad weather. In all other
respects, however, the exposition was a
splendid success.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 19.â The
President has issued a proclamation read
justing boundaries of a naval reservation
ta Alaska which were subject to encroach
upon lands belonging to the Greek church

TWO TYPES OF CRUISERS.
Protected and Armored Teasels Com
paredâSome Difference* in Navies.
It has often been observed that while
England has an abundance of protected
cruisers and in her new Powerful and Ter
rible carries the type to enormous dis
placement?, she has paid little attention
to the armored cruiser. On theot erhand,
Russia, which is not all distinguished for
her protected cruiser class, has built pow
erful armor* d cruisers and nas carried
them to the verge of the fast battle-ship
class.
If we make comparison between our
New York and Brooklyn, which are dis
inctively armored cruisers, and British
ships which might undertaka to meet
them, the Blake and Blenheim are per
haps tbe oftenest suggested for tne pur
pose. Yet these last are regarded by the
British as protected cruisers only", al
though it is not customary to compare
them with our Columbia and Minneapolis,
which are distinctively protected cruisers
and thorough examples of the unarmored
class.
The essential distinction, as put by the
Pall Mall Gazette, is that the armored
cruiser has a great extent of thin armor
plating applied vertically to the sides, to
gether with a protective deck at about the
level of the water line, while the protected
cruiser "has not the vertical plating, but
has a thicker deck." As a result, although
some shelter is eiveri to her heavier guns
by being placed in armored inclosures. she
is open to shot and shell above the water
lice, her steel sides being exposed to be
"wrecked by high explosives. 1 ' Originally,
according to the authority just spoken of,
the defense was deliberately thus sacrificed
to speed and coal supply, it being supposed
that "the thin sides wouid admit the pas
sage of a shell without exploding, the pro
jectile entering on one side and passing
out of the other." The earliest ships of
this class in the British navy are said to
have been the Comus and her mates, dis
placing about 2400 tons' and manned by
265 men.
But in the days of the Comus the 6- inch
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1896.
gun could fire perhaps one shell a minute,
charged with ordinary gunpowder,
whereas now it can fire seven at the maxi
mum and it is loaded with lyddite or
melinite. Another point suggested is that
while the decks of the old cruiser were
fairly clear, they are now so incumbered
with machinery and gear that only shells
with an unusual capacity for dodging will
be able to pass through tne ship. Besides,
fuses have been so constructed that, if
necessary, they will burst the shell on ton
tact with thin steel.
The conclusion seems to be that more or
less armor on the sides is desirable; but
the new vessels of the protected cla3S in
England are constructed without it. There
are now building or soon to be begun
thirty-four protected cruisers. These in
clude the Powerful and her mate of 14,200
tons and 22 knots speed, and carrying two
9.2-inch and twelve quick-fire 6-inch guns,
and a crew of 840 each ; then eight Andro
medas of 11,000 tons. 20 knots, sixteen 6
inch guns, and GOO men; seven of the
Arrogant class, of 5750 tons, and nine of
the Eclipse class, of 5650, all of 19>Â£ knots,
with modern armaments, 6-inch guns at
largest, and crews of 450: eight of the
Pelorus class, of 2135 tons, 20 knots, and
200 men.
Here it will be seen that only two in the
whole list have guns exceeding the 6
inch. The Arrogant class, too, is said to
be inferior in gun power by n-arly 30 per
cent to the French Catinat, wnich, with
1900 tons less displacement, has more coal,
a smaller crew, a thicker deck, and only
half a knot less speed. The Buenos Ayres,
built at Elswick, has double the Arrogant's
gun power, a smaller crew, a thicker deck,
over three knots greater speed, and yet
1000 tons less displacement. The British
ships are believed to have stronger hulls,
but it is questioned whether other quali
ties have not been somewhat sacrificed.
In Germany are building or projected
three protected cruisers to one armored
cruiser; in France, twelve to two; in Rus
sia, one to four; in the United States, none
to one; in Italy, one to tive. The cases of
Russia and Italy are specially noteworthy.
Still, of the Russian armored cruisers, one.
which is an improved Rurik, is considered
by the British authority quoted to be not
better than the Powerful. Two others,
the Peresiret and Oslabia. are really almost
battle-ships, while the fourth will proba
bly be of the Dupuy de Lome class. This
last vessel is praised in high terms for her
union of good qualities, her distinctive
features being her broad belt to exclude
high explosives and quick-firing shells.
The authority just spoken of thinks that
our new Brooklyn will be inferior to the
British Powerful in most respects, but con
siders that the Dupuy de Lome would be
superior to any Brrtush cruiser except the
Powerful, and that the latter would have
quite enough to do in standing up to her.
It is rather odd that Great Britain has
built no armored cruiser since the Austra
lia class, com pieted half a dozen years ago.
WISE OFFICE BATS
They Had a "cherae That Beat the
New-Fangled Trap.
The employes of the Jersey City Print
ing Company have for a long time been
troubled wiih rats. The rodents are of
unusual size and are extremely bald.
They are boldest after dark, and tbink
nothing of running over the feet of the
employes.
Several cats were placed in the building
with the hope that they would exter
minate the rats, but the latter made it so
warm for the cats that they were driven
away.
Various schemes have been worked to
entrap the rodents, but with little success.
Finally Engineer August Krone hit upon
a sc.eme that fora time bade fair to be
just the thing. He secured an old zinc
oil tank about 3 feet in height, and then
fastened on the edge a 2-foot piece of
board. Then he arranged the board so
that it would swing up and down with one
end inside the tank. He placed a piece of
bologna sausage, fastened with a rubber
band, on the edge of the board which pro
jected over the inside of the tank, and half
lilled the vessel with water. A few pieces
of cheese were placed along the other end
of the board to coax the rats on.
The trap was set where rats are thickest
in the basement, and in a few minutes a
rat climbed upon the end of the board
which protruded outside the tank and
rested upon a support. The rodent ate
the cheese and then went for the bologna.
As it reached the bait the other end of the
board tipped up and the rat, with a squeal,
fell into the water and was drowned.
"Oh, that's the trick," said the engineer,
and his assistant said AugusHiad a great
head.
Within ten minutes six more rats walked
the plank, and then there was a remark
able display of rat's cnteness.
Two rodents climbed the pile of papers,
and while one stood on the safe end of the
board the other carefully made its way to
the tempting bologna and devoured "half
of it. The rats then changed places and
the other ate the rest of the bologna and
half the rubber band.
The engineer scratched his head and the
other spectators said something about
people going to a lot of trouble for noth
ing.
During the afternoon no more rats were
caught, but a lot of cheese was eaten by
them. The engineer solemnly avers that
he saw the rats not only balance one
another on the board while the tempting
bait was devoured, but that the rodents
actually engaged in a wame of see-saw
simnly for amusement. August still has
faith in his patent trap, but nobody else
has. â Newart Daily Advertiser.
THE HOBBIES OF CELEBRITIES.
Fads by Which Great People Seek Be-
taxation.
It has often been said that, notwith
standing the old adage, "Little things
please little minds," most great men have
ridden some strange hobby, and that, a- a
rule, the greater the man the more insig
nificant his hobby. .Doubtless this fact
arises from the need which a hard-taxed
brain has of relaxation, though a truly
large mind will never descend to childisu
ness, even when at rest.

CALIFORIA NOW
THE MINING MECCA
W. F. Farish on the Change

He Is Busy With His Report
on the Taylor Prop
erty.
Big Mining Men of Colorado and Lon
don Who Are Making In
vestments.
William F. Farish. the noted Colorado
mining engineer who is here to report on
the Taylor mine of El Dorado County for
a London syndicate, believes that Califor
nia is on the eve of a great mining boom.
Mr. Farish is an old Californian. He
WILLIAM F. FARISH, the Noted Mining Engineer,
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
was formerly manaeer of the Sierra Buttes
and Black Bear mines, the latter now
owned by Director Daggett of the Mint.
Mr. Farish went to Colorado in 1878 and
became identified extensively with mining
there. He has not been in this Stats for
eight years.
He was at his rooms at the Palace yes
terday, surrounded by several old mining
friends, when a Call representative met
him. He has recently spent several weeks
at various points on the mother lode.
"I have never before seen such intelli
gence in prospecting and carrying on
mining in California as now," said Mr.
Farish. "The money that is put in the
ground counts Hot sometniug. It is not
wasted. All over the world there is a bet
ter feeling as regards gold mining.
"Not only California, bat the whole
gold-bearing section of the Western Hemi
sphere is on the edge of a boom. In Cen
tral and South America and in Mexico,
where there are gold mines tnere promises
to be activity. There seems to be a re
action in the minds of miners with refer
ence to Mexico. I was down there during
Gonzaies' adruinistrat on and got enough
of it, but now the laws are changed so
that there are far more advantages for
foreign interests.
"I can say for one thing that there is a
great deal of interest in California among
Coloradans, and most of the Colorado
men are well-to-do. Ex-Senator Dorsey
and his lriends have large properties near
the Colorado River, in ttafa etate, and are
going to build a raiiroad and put up a
large plant of machinery. The ex-Senator
tells me, too, that he is going to look up
other mines in California, with the idea of
getting and developing them.
"If a wine pays 10 or 15 per cent prob
ably a great body of ore can be found on
development, while if he took hold of a
well-developed mine he would have to pay
for all the ore in sight. I think these ef
forts to develop mines will result in good
to the holder, the company which takes
an interest and develops, and to the coun
try generally.
"California mines, probably more than
any other now, are attracting attention.
I think there is an excellent outlook here
for mining. Fortunes ought to be made
and the interest quickened in every way in
mining."
Mr. Fari6h is busy making out his re
ports, in company with other experts.
He will be in the (Jity for several days, at

A TABLE OF A SPARROW.
"Business Before Pleasure" a< a Precept
Needs Modifying Materially.
As the plain-looking but intelligent little
mother Sparrow was hopping about the
street the other day, picking up a variety
of food bits, a person dressed in white
clothing and carrying a big broom came
along and began to sweep the dirt of the
street into a heap in the gutter. As this
interfered somewhat with the pursuit of
the Sparrow, she flew away up to the win
dow-sill of her friend the Man, and finding
him there, as usual, in his easy chair, she
said :
"I have observed that the different indi
viduals of your race follow a great variety
of vocations. For instance, your work
seems to be of a nature, if I may judge
from appearances, that is very different
from that of the fellow down there clean
ing the street. You are much cleaner and
much more comfortable every wav, I
should say, than he is. Do me the favor
to explain how it happens that he should
prefer sweeping the street to a life like
yours."
"I would with pleasure," said the Man,
"if it were so. But be does not prefer bis
life to mine. He finds it very disagree
able."
"Is that possible? 1 ' asked the Sparrow
in astonishment. "Why, then, does he
do such work?"
"Well, perhaps, I cannot make it clear
to you, but the individuals of our race,
with rare exceptions, choose the employ
ment by which they can make the most
money. .Now, you birds have no money,
but â let me see- are you acquainted with
the habits of bluejays?"
"Somewhat?"
"Weil, the bluejay Is perhaps nearer to
the human race in intelligence than any
other bird. It is bright in many ways, but
it is especially so in that it pathers food
during pleasant weather and stores it
away for ute when the ordinary sources of
food are depleted. Moat of our race de
vote their energies, regardless of their
tastes, to such labor as will enable them to
lay up the largest stores for a rainy day,
as we say. It is this provident spirit in
our race that leads to what we call enter
prise. It sends men into tbe wilderness
to carve farms out of the solid green ; it
takes them to the desert plains, where they
pass long years, enduring great hardship,
that they may increase their herds
and flocks; it holds them to a life
in tents and huts in the ruining camps
among the mountain enows, where the
precious metals are dug from the earth.
They are willing, as we 9ay, to sacrifice a
present pleasure for a future good. They
do not all succeed in accumulating the
stores they are after â indeed, the great
majority of them fail altogether, but they
are buoyed up constantly by the hope that
they will be able eventually to leave the
disagreeable lives they lead, to forsake the
surroundings and society that are not in- I
frequently abhorrent to them, and begin i
to enjoy the comforts and luxuries to
which their natural tastes are suited."
At tflis moment a blank ant appeared on I
tbe window-sill. The Sparrow was about !
to pect at it, but the Man stooped her. \
"Wait," he said. "Do you know the 1
manner of life of the ants?"
"Very well," replied the Sparrow.
"Good. Then I may say that the wisest
of our rHce has held up the ant as a niodel
citizen because it devotes all its ener^iea
to accumulatinp, in pleasant weather. 1
hope you understand the arift of what I
have said, because if you do, and act ac
cordingly you will De greatiy benefited."
"Thank you for your good wishes," re
plied tbe Sparrow, "and I think I under
stand the drift of what you have said
better, if you will pardon me. than what
you or your race do. And I can't help
adding that I hfar with profound amaze
ment that, with all your boasted intelli
eence, you have in your greed rpjeciei the
example of the bird's who take no thought
for the morrow, and have chosen the slave
driving, underground drudgery "of the
antÂ» as the lite bi-si suited for the develop
ment of your race."â New York Sun.

THE MURDERER OF
JAMES H. CHILDS
John Miller Says He Shot
His Man in Self-
Defense.
This Claim Said to Be Net Sub
stantiated by the
Facts.
Childs Was Smcking His Pipe and
Reading When He Went Forth
to Meet His Death.
John Miller, the hunchback, who shot
and killed James Henry Childs on Clem
entina street Wednesday alternoon while
Childs was attempting to prevent him
from murdering Mrs. Nellie Ryan, a
woman with whom he had been living,
appeared in Judge Joachimsen's court
yesterday morning. By consent the case
was continued till November 25.
Miller has retained Attorney H. G.
Grant to defend him. Grant knew him in
Los Angeles. Miller cave Grant an order
on the police for the keys to his carpen
ter shop, 1149 Foliom street, and the per
sonal effects taken from him at the time
of his arrest.
Miller has been instructed by his attor
ney to preserve absolute silence about the
case, and his attorney intimated that the
theory of the trial would be that Miller
acted in seif-defense.
When Miller was taken to tbe Southern
station Wednesday afternoon he made an
attempt to commit suicide, but the officers
were too quick for him. He has been
carefully watched in his cell, and as he
was m&king an attempt to take off his
suspenders during the night, one of tbe
other occupants of the cell took them from
him after a struggle and handed them to
the sergeant in charge of the prison.
Miller sits apart from the other prisoners
and refuses to converse with them.
In his statement published yesterday
Miller said that when Mrs. Ryan left him
she went to tbe Central hotel on Third
street with a plasterer. The proprietor of
the hotel denies that the woman was a
guest at his hotel and says that one of his
rules is that no women guests are allowed.
The body of the murdered man, J. H.
Childs, was laid out in a casket last night
in the home of his mother, 425% Clemen
tina street. W. W. Childs, George W.
Childs and Charles Childs, the three
brothers of the deceased, and his two
sisters, Mrs. Andrew White and Miss Lilly
Childa, were surrounded by friends from
all over the country who came to mourn
with them.
Young Chiids' fellow-employes from
Sterling & Dunphy's, the distributors,
were also in attendance.
The story of the uncalled-for murder
was retold time and again, and the details
are such that the plea of self-defense upon
which Miller relies is claimed to be un
tenabie.
W. W. Cbilds, a brother of the deceased,
made this statement:
"We were together in the front room of
our home. He was reading The Call to
mother and smoking his pipe. The front
door was open and I rose to close it. Just
t. en the Bcreama of the woman outside
and the shooting made both of us move
faster. I was in the lead, and as I opened
the door I took in the situation at a glance.
"I saw the pistol in the man's grasp
and the woman who was running from
him. I grabbed her and pulled her
toward me. Brother was right behind
me, and the last words I heard him speak
were addressed to the woman. He said:
'Get in here; I'll not let him hurt you.'
My brother was very near-sighted and I'm
sure he didn't see the pistol.
"When I got the woman inside brother
put both hands over Miller's shoulders
and s-aid something to him. It was like,
"Don't do that, man.'
"Just then the fellow raised his pistol
! and tired and my brother fell dead. When
I we picked him up hi 3 pipe lay under his
: body."
Derivation of Phrases.
Next to Shakespeare, we draw most pro-
I fusely from King James' version of the
j Bible for terse expressions, Proverbs and
j Ecclesiastes furnishing the larger propor
j tion from the Old Testament, and St.
I Paul's epistles from the New. Milton,
I though far behind these two great
| sources of English speech, gives us
i more familiar expressions than any
; otner writer after them. From him
I we have learned to speak of "a dim
i religious light," of "grim death," "a
I heaven on earth," and "sancity of rea
son"; of "adding fuel to the flame," of
"tempering ju-tice with mercy," of the
"busy hum of men," "the light fantastic
I toe" (that boon to provincial reporters),
| and the "neat-handed Philiis." Chaucer,
tnous;h rich in material for quotation, has
given us no t>ithy phrases, but from Spen
ser, who sang of him as the "well of Eng
lish undefyled," we get "nor rhyme nor
reason," "by hook or Â©rook," "sweet at
tractive erace, : ,' and "through thick and
thin." â Chambers Journal.

CHICAGO HAKEETB.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 19â A very nncerratn
feeling prevailed in the wheat market this morn
ing. The early Liverpool quoted s^il advance, j
which did not compare favorably with our rattier i
fancy bulge of yesterday. Our opening : was
therefore with a somewhat restrained feeling,
prices losing from 14c to %c- The offerings were
not very plentiful, and upon a disposition to buy
being evinced a sharp bu^ce of over a cent took
place. The gain was scarcely achieved when late r

A Relic of Napoleon.
There has just died in the Melbourne
Immigrants' Home an old Irishman
named James Casey, who was an eye- j
witness of the last scene of all in the
strange, eventful history of the Conqueror
of Europe. :; ; " . His claim" to a niche in his
tory." writes ; the Melbourne Argus, "lay
in the fact that he was a member of the j
military bind at the funeral of the great '
Napoleon in St. Helena."^ Casey was one
of ; the oldest of colonists, having, first
landed in Melbourne in 1837, when it was
a village of less than a hundred houses.

Oaklajtd Orrici, Bak Fbascisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 19. j
ThÂ« politicians of all parties are now
face to face with a difficult problem. To
only one party â the Republican â is the
future at all clear.
During the past two days there have
been several consultations between some
of the managers, but nothing definite has
been decided. There is not so much in
terest being shown in the individuals to
put up for the various city offices as in the
status and attitude of the old parties.
t' In municipal politics for the past four
[ yearÂ» there have been Republican, Demo
[ iratic, Populist and Non-Partisan tickets
in Ihe field. The Non- Partisans have be
come very partisan, the Democrats and
Populists have lost their identity, and
only the Republican party remains intact.
The so-called Fusionists, about whose
strength so much was said prior to elec
tion, were proved to have no existence at
all, for the returns show that if there was
a"hy fusion it was between the so-calleu
Fusionists and Republicans.
The Democratic and Populist managers
are now at sea. They have been accusing
each other of all tfincl? of treachery and
bad faith since the election and do not
speak as they pass by. To organize a
silver party out of the combined wreck
for the purpose of a purely municipal
campaign would be too much of a farce.
Under the circumstances, tbe fusion ele
ment has no place, as a party, in local
politics, although it teems with men who
are itching for office.
On the other hand, the Republican
party never had so complete or entnnsias
tic an Organization, and never did its
ranks contain so many men fit and eligible
for office. The recent election ahows that
Oakland is a very pronounced Republican
city, and after the unpleasantnesses at the
City Hall for the past four years, every
body is anxious for a clean party adminis
tration.
The story is being freely circulated that
strenuous efforts are being made to change
the majority in the Board of Works, with
a view to making changes in the Fire,
Police and Street departments. It is said
that if Engineer Wilson and Mayor Davie
will combine and nil the departments
with Republicans, they may receive the
Republican nominations to succeed them
selves. It is not likely that any such plan
will go through, for although the Mayor
womd like to see many cuanges he would
not make them as the result of a "deal,"
for he is most vehemently opposed to such
combinations, and has had two years' ex
perience of poiag a .one, which has not
induced him to seek an alJiance.
Ihe only way in which the Republican
party can be severed is by the injection of
â¢a so-called non-partisan party into the
coping campaign. Four years ago there
nri^ht have been a need of it; to-day there
is not.

FINE WORK OF
ALAMEDA ARTISTS
The Formal Opening of
Their First Semi-An
nual Exhibit.
With Few Exceptions, All the
Pictures Are of Sc?nes in
the County.
Reception in the Beautifully Deco
rated Studio of the
League.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 19.â The Art
League exhibition was opened to-uight by
a reception lo members and their friends
at the league rooms in the Central b'.ock.
Mr. Neilson'B studio, in the southeast cor
ner of the building, was filled with the
water-color exhibits and blacc and white
sketches, of which there was a great
variety.
The studio of the league was wholly de
voted to the oil paintings. The electric
liehts were arranged by the artists, who
saw that all of the pictures secured the
headlight effects.
The hall and stairway were beauti
fully decorated with ivy, smilax and
palms. Just above the center of the final
landing, and suspended from the ceiling,
was a huge Japanese lantern. On either
side were suspended preity floral baskets
covered with smilnx. T^e hallway was
set with ferns and palms, wLile the_jvai s
and chandeliers were festooned with
smilax in excellent tsste and making a
very picturesque effect.
Several sketches of the nude adorned
the south wall. At tbe east end of the
hall, in a bower of green, the orchestra is
located, and each evening it will present
an interesting prosranime. Lemonade
and punch were handed round by the
young artists.
The place was crowded by tbe'ariists'
friends, nearly all of the 400 receiving
invitations being in attendance.
The Alameda Art Lsagoe is an associa- '
tion formed for the study and practice of i
the higher branches of art. At this, the
third year of the league's existence, it has
been decided to give half-yearly exhibi- â¢
tions, to which the public will be invited, i
By this means it is hoped that a more gen
eral local interest in art will be promoted. !
Upon payment of the nominal sum of $1
annually, names are enrolled on the li=t i
of honorary members, who receive in vita- '
tions to all receptions preceding tbe half- i
yearly exhibitions of paintings and
sketches.
T c officers are: Ralph Robinsori, presi
dent; C. Chapel Judson, vice-president; C.
P. Neiison, secretary. The Ladies' Aux

FOR OVER PIFTY YEARS.
The Phenomenal Record of a Railroad
Enslneer.
"Within the past three weeks a number
I of changes have been made among the en
gineers of the New York Central. These
changes involve a good deal of pathos,
too. Once an engineer, always an en
gineer, and the average man who opens
the throttle on one of the flying machines
rarely feels content to occupy any other
position in life.
Examinations as to the condition of ihe
engineers' eyes are now being held in the
city of New York, and every few days one
or more of them receive notice to appear
before the examining board and hare
their eyes tested.
Of course, to everyone of these, it i? like
saying pood-by to their best friend when
they leave the cab of the.engine of one of
the great trains and comedown to a less
exciting position. But of all among the
number there can be none who, in many
ways, will feel the change more keenly
than Engineer James W. Wood, who has
been in the employ of the New York Cen
tral for over fifty-one years, ana whose
record is one of the most phenomenal in
the history of railroading.
Every railroad man in the State of New
York knows -of "Jim" Wood. Not a rail
road man in the city but will be sorry to
hear that he is among the number who
failed to receive a first-class certificate.
Mr. Wood (himself takes the matter philo
sophically] is proud of his long career
and still maintrins the friendliest rela
tions with the great corporation for which
he has labored during so many years. '
"Jim" brought the special train con
taining James Gordon Bennett's party
from Buffalo to Syracuse on March 1. 1876.
The run was thÂ« fastest ever made in the
world, .considering the distance. .The
157.74 miles were traversed in two hours
and forty-five . minutes. "Jim" ran into
Syracuse at the rate of 68.54 miles an hour.
<An instance is related of a trip that
Commodore Vanderbilt took behind '"Jim"
Wood. The commodore used to like to
ride fast, but this time.be rode too fast.
"Jim" drew the old railroad magnate
from Rochester to Syracuse in eighty-three
minutes. He attained such a rate of speed
that the commodore actually rang him
up/ This was the only time that be was
ever known to give orders to an engineer
to slow up.
During the fifty-one years that "Jim"
Wood has ran nn engine on the Central,
it is said that he has never cost the com
pany a dollar; has never been in an acci
dent, and in this respect has a record
which is absolutely phenomenal. He pos
sesses strong and manly traits of charac
ter, is temperate in his habits, is, yet; a
well-preserved man, and appears physi
cally as strong as ever. He has been noted
for his coolness, the steadiness of - his
nerve and his great presence of mind.
He practically inaugurated the ; fast
train system, and for years was Known as
one of the most successful engineers in the
world. * London papers have contained
long accounts of runs by America's fast
engineer. His career shows that intelli
gence has as much to do with running an
engine as â¢ a knowledge of machinery.
When the two are combined it is at once
evident that a master hand is at the
throttle. '
In October, 1894. "Jim" Wood drew the
train upon which Governor McKin lev was
making a tour through , the : ; State": At
Syracuse, N. V., - Engineer Wood . was in
troduced to McKinley, who said: "I feel
like talcing off my hat to you. " Glad to
meet you," and then be added, as he re
called the lightninglike manner in which
the train bad been run and swung around
the curves. "I have felt f a great ; interest
in you all through the morning."
Engineer Wood will be given a local en
gine for the present, and doubtless some
good position will be made for him in the
service ?of the road'- with â ; which he has
been so long and honorably connected.â

A BANQUET TO
THE MAYOR-ELECT
Pleasant Words and Good
Company for Mr.
Phelan.
Dines in State in the Rooms
of the Bohemian
Club.
Ninety Guests Drink Success to Him
and to His Adminis
tration.
A dinner was given at the Bohemian
Club last evening in compliment to
Mayor-elect James D. Phelan. The ban
quet was spread in the main dining-room.
Ninety guests sat down to the feast and
listened to the speeches by Dr. George
Chismore, president of the Club, Mayor
elect Phelan, W. H. L. Barnes, William
Greer Harrison, Horace G. Platt, George
T. Bromley, Thomas J. Clunie and sev
eral more 6i the owl's eloquent orators.
Songs were sung by Donald de V. Graham
and Frank Coffin. An original poem by I
General Lucius Harwood Foote was hap
pily received. Tliere were violin solos,
chorus singing and orchestra music. The
banquet was a happy event all around
and lasted until the midnight hour.
Grave subjects of municipal reform and
new charter projects were not discussed,
but incidentally the Mayor-elect and Gen
eral Barnes roasted the Portland Ore
ponian for its contemptible insinuations
regarding the moral tone of San Fran
cisco.
Mr. Phelan is not the first member of
the club elected Mayor, as E. B. Pond and
William Alvonl have represented the owl
at the City Hall, but he is the first ex
president who has accepted the office of
Mayor.
ALLIGATOR SENSE.
They Don't Have Much Before They
Are 100 Year-. Old.
','Do you know," said Colonel Ben Cason,
leaning back in his chair, "that alligators
are the most affectionate creatures on
earth? It's a fact. And tbe sense they
have! They're wonders. They've got
more sense than a dog. How do I know?
Haven't I educated 'em? Ain't there an
j alligator 110 years old in Dcs Allemaud
I Bayou that would work his tail to tha
| bone for me if I asked him to? Say â you
make m<j tired. What are you laughing
at? You get a gallon of molasses and a
long-necked bottle and I'll show you how
to tame alligators. It's the easiest thing
on earth. They're so affectionate.
"On January 23, 1885, I went to Dcs
Allemand Bayou fishing. A negro named
Baptiste Fourier had just ciught an alli
gator 100 years old. I could tell by the
rings around him. You can't train a
young alligator. That's funny, ain't it?
! I asked Baptiste to sell him to me. 1
paid $4 95, and Jimâ that's the alligator's
name â was mine. I put a chain around
his neck. Then I got a long-necked bot
tle, filled it with molasses and walked np
to him. He opened his jaws to nab me.
That was my chance. I shoved the neck
of the bottle in his mouth, just back of his
ears, where an alligator has no teeth. I
tilled the bo; tie up. Jim tasted the mo
lasses and began wagging his tail. He
broke Baptiste's leg, but that was an
accident. He was as gentle as a
setter dog from tlie minute De tasted the
molasses. I taught him a lot of pretty
tricks â hew to catch flies, how to stand on
his tail, how to chew tobacco. Finally I
harnessed Him up to a boat. He looked
around at me to see what I wanted. I
reached over the side of the boat and
pushed him a little. Then he understood.
Off he went. When I pulled on the rope
I had around hi 3 neck he was nonplused
for a minute, but he soon caught on, and
now when I go to Dcs Allemand I never
have to hire anybody to paddle my canoe.
Jim attends, to carrying me anywhere t
want to go.
"Say, do you know Jim is as glad to see
me whenever I pass that way as if he was
a relative of mine. vVhat's that? Of
course it's the truth. Ask Baptiste. He
takeÃ care of Jim for me while 1 am in
New Orleans."â New Orleans Times-Dem

THE POLAR REGION.
What Is to Be Gained From Arctic
Exploration.
To ascertain with greater precision the
shape, size and density of ihe earth, the
astronomer's base of measures, and thus
render the science of surveying more accu
rate, ten pendulum observations near the
unknown extreme of the arc are wortn a
hundred elsewhere. Observation? on mag
netism, especially near the magnetic pole,
will benefit the thousands of ocean vessels
which largely depend for their safety on
the precision with which the compass can
be interpreted. To the meteorologist the
Arctic is of special Importance, because it
presents the extremes of a world-em
bracing system, each of whose parts affect
every other. Tides and currents are sim
ilarly interdependent. The aurora can
best be studied where it is most common
and most iully developed.
Observations on tbe character and be
havior of plants and animals under the
unique conditions of the Arctic will give
to the student of organic life a more thor
ough mastery of his problems. To that
end the hydrography must be known
(depth of sea, temperature, water move
ment, sea bottom, salinity, light). Tbe
Arctic aflords the best facilities for study
ing one set of geologic forces (glaciers,
icebergs, lroet fissurinc) in their extreme
manifestation. The condition of the
earth in past geologic epochs will
not be fully known until the strata of
the Arctic lands have been mapped. To
the paleontologist the Arctic has already
yielded most valuable information in the
fossil evidence of a mild climate. Lock
wood and Brainard found the slopes of
western Grinnell Land studded with large
petrified tree stumps. These and similar
fossils, precious to museums or geologic
cabinets, can probably be reached by way
of Hayes Sound. To the ethnologist the
Eskimo represent a phase of human life
without a parallel. â Appleton's Science

Why Bag Paper Is Scarce
Why is so much of the paper used by
publishers nowadays of such poor quality?
Mr. G. H. Putnam in the New York Sun
gives this extraordinary reasonâ the de
crease of religious fanaticism on the
eastern shoras of the Mediterranean.
â¢'Myriads of pilgrims used to cross those
dreary deserts on their Mray to Mecca,
every one,oi them being clothed in flow
ing garments of finest white linen. Out
cf their number hundreds and thousands
would die by the wayside, rendering it at
one time a most profitable business to
strip these linen garments from the
bodies and send them to the large paper
factories of Europe. It was from this
source, > Mr. Putnam says, that t c best
paper was obtained, but the Mohamme
dans no longer in such large numbers
undertake these pilgrimages, therefore
not so many die by the wayside, and
hence the inability.to furnish so high a
quality of paper."

GEYSER IS A
RARE GOOO ONE
Defeated an All- Aged Field
in a Handicap
Handily.
Four Out of Five Favorites Win
Again at the Oakland
Track.
Earl Cochran Captured the Third
Event at Odds of 12 to Iâ Tea
Rose Cakewalked in Again-
It was Tery uncertain weather, that at
Oakland yesterday. At intermittent
spells light showers fell, but not a down
pour that spoiled the sport. Although
the attendance was not as large as usual,
considerable coin changed hands in the
betting ring. The track was heavy, but
not muddy, and favorites took four of the
five events decided.
By far the best performance was that of
the two-year-old Geyser, running in the
colors of Ed Corrigan. Giving away
pounds of weight to aged horses in the
six-furlong nish-weight handicap, he
picked up his allotted 117 pounds, got
away irom the post absolutely last, waded
through the bunch and won by a neck,
galloping, from old Derfargilla. It was a
most meritorious feat and stamps the Ben
Ali youngster as about the best horse of
his age over a distance in these parts. He
opened a 3to 2 favorite, but went bacK in
the betting until 3 and 3^ to 1 was ob
tainable, it looking impossible that he
could concede so much weight.
Louis Ezell's Doubtful was made an
8 to 5 favorite for t'je first race over six
furlongs, and with Eddie Jones up won
with little in reserve from Klmer F, a 7 to
1 shot, ridden by Shaw. Boreas was a
poor third.
A prohibitive 1 to 3 favorite for the two
year-old event at six furlongs, Tea Rose
took the lead from thfe jump and running
under a pull the entire way, joeged past
the wire two lengths before Fortunate.
The latter beat Draught a head for place
in a hard drive.
The Cochran stable folks unloaded a
very warm one in the six-furlong sprint
that followed in Earl Cochran, a brown
gelding named after the owner's son.
Opening at 12 he was played down several
points, but before post time went back in
the betting again. Little Mclutyre, who
rode him, gradually moved up from fourth
position, and assuming the lead in the
stretch defeated Cadenza rather cleverly
by over a length. Last Chance, the
favorite, came with a rush at the end, tin
isning third.
Barney Schrieber's old horse, Braw
Scot, added one more to his long string -of
wins in the last, a seven-furlong run.
Plunged on at evens he got away in front
and, never headed, romped in half a
length in front of Navy Blue, who dropped
from tne clouds, beating Encino for the
place.
Notes.
Siarter Ferguson fined Eddie Jones $100
for beating the gate with Braw Scot. It
certainly seems that with tlie Australian
gate a starter shonld fine himself $500 if
he let a boy beat him away from tne po?t.
Riley Grannan, the noted plunger, and
hany Harris, the lightning fast block
man for Bookmaker George Wheelock,
were due to arrive here from the East last
evening. Will Wallace, it was thought,
might make it three-handed.
Alter Braw Scot had won the last race
he was bid up $400 over his entered selling
price of $200 by Tom Boyle, owner of Navy
Blue, who finished second. There is no
use denying the fact that Tom is on the
rignt tack, but from the way his own
horse was ridden and the way he came at
the end would h ye prevented many from
taking advantage of the selling 'condi
tions. He looked very much like the best
horse in thÂ» race at the end.
The unlucky thirteen bookmakers
weighed in yesterday. Hugbey Jones, for
whom tlie sheets have not been breaking
just right the past few days, concluded to
take a season on the mound.

Coast Jockey Club annnounces the date

DEFENDED HIS WIFE
John Cook Acquitted on a Charge of
Deadly Assault.
John Cook, charged with assault with a
deadly weapon, was acquitted yesterday
in Judge Wallace's court by a jury with
out the tatter leaving their seats. Joseph
Cordes was ttie complaining witness. He
said that without any reasonable cause
Cook flew at him while he was talking
with Cook's wife and struck him with a
knife, and that he retaliated in self
defense.
Several witnesses, including the defend
ant, gave a different view of the case, but
it wag not until Mrs. Cook, wife of the ac
cused, bad completed her testimony that
a clear understanding of the altercation
was had. Mrs. Cook's story was very
clear. She said she was in her room at
the lodgine-house where she and her hus
band were living, and that Cordes entered
the room without her invitation and made
an insulting proposal to her; that she
cried out in anger against him, and that
Cordes seized her wrists; that her hus
band at that moment entered the room,
and that Cordes at once released her and
seizing a Knife that was lying on the table
attacked her husband, stabbing him dan
gerously; that in the struggle her hus
band obtained possession of the knife and
inflicted certain wounds on Cordes, after
which Cordes ran away.
The testimony being all in and argu
ment being waived, Judge Wallace began
to deliver the usual cnarge to the jury,
but after uttering a few words Hesitated a
moment, and then turning to Assistant
District Attorney Hinkie said: "I sup
pose, Mr. District Attorney, that you will
scarcely ask for a verdict against this de
fendant upon such testimony as this?"
"I think not," replied" Mr. Hinkie,
cheerfully, aud thereupon the jury as one
man rose up and said: "We find the de
fendant not guilty.''
SUICIDE OF A BUTCHER.
William H Johnson Hangs Himself in
a Stable on Oak Grove Avenue.
William Henry Johnson, a butcher liv
ing at 34 Oak Grove avenue, committed
suicide by hanging himself in a stable in
the rear of the premises on Wednesday
night When J. G. Johnson, the whole
sale butcher of South San Francisco, went
to the stable yesterday morning he found
the body of the suicide hanging to a beam.
The body was removed to the Morgue.
Johnson was a nephew of J. G. Johnson,
with whom he has been living for a long
time. The uncle is at a loss for a reason
why his relative should end his life other
than that he hs<i been afflicted with
stomach troubles for several years. On
Wednesday night at 10 o'clock he bade
the folks good night, and that was the last
seen of him alive. It was apparent that
be had been dead many hours when the
body was found. Deceased was 41 years
of age and was a native of New Hamp
shire. It was his intention to visit his
native State in a few weeks and live with
his folks. He was not married.
A DISAGREEABLE DUTY.
Breaking the -Newt* of a Man's Death
to Bis Widow.
Shortly after 6 o'clock Wednesday even
ing the body of a laborer was found in the
hold of the steamer San Bias, lying at the
Union Iron Works dock. He had evi
dently fallen into the hold and death was
caused by a broken neck. Who he was no
one around the dock knew. The body was
removed to the Morgue.
Yesterday it was learned that the man
was Daniel Sheehan, a stevedore living at
323 a Clementina street. What he was
doing on the San Bias is not known. A
friend of Sheeban went to tell the widow
what bad happened, but, though he is a
hardy old sea captain, his heart failed him
when he met the woman, and after chat
ting for a few minutes he went back to
the Morgue, and Deputy Coroner MeCor
mick was sent to break the news. He was
advised to have a physician present, as
the shock to the woman might cause two
more deaths. He did not appreciate his
duty in the least.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1896.
AFTER TWO DAYS
OF WEDDED BLISS
Attorney James H. Long's
Wife Has Sought Legal
Advice.
A Surprised Husband, Who
Thought His Wile Was
Homesick.
Her Attorney, H. I. Kowalsky, Says
He Wil Commence Suit ior
Divorce.
Mrs. James H. Long has sought the ad
vice of Colonel Henry I. Kowalsky, who
says that within ten days he is going to
commence suit for divorce in her name.
The colonel says tie has had the case
placed in his hands, but he does not yet
know the specific grounds on which the
suit will be brought, but he ?ays there is
no hope of a reconciliation.
On the evening of November 4 James
H. Long, the well-known Police Court
lawyer, and Miss Florence Marks, the
handsome and accomplished daughter of
Louis Marks, were united in the holy
bonds of matrimony. The ceremony, fol
lowed by an elaborate banquet, was cele
brated at the Maisun Kiche, Judge Bel
cher pronouncing the solemn words that
made two loving hearts one.
The wedding of the young couple fol
lowed close upon a brief acquaintance and
hurried courtship. Miss Marks bad en
joyed but two moonlight promenades with
| the man of her choice before the eventful
wedding day.
But brief as the courtship was the
honeymoon was briefer. After two days
the youn<; bride, with a tale of direst woe,
returned to the parental residence, 1015
Gulden Gate avenue.
Mrs. Long's family is much incensed,
and has anything* but kindly things!
to say of the new member of their j
family. They claim he hypnotized the I
girl aud dazzled her with his tales of a
princely income per month by his law
practice.
Mrs. Long, who is a talented young lady
and accomplished artist, was preparing to
leave for Europe to complete her art stud- |
ies when she met Long and abandoned all
her plans for his sake.
When Attorney Long was seen yester
day by a Call reporter and questioned
relative to the separation, his astonish
ment was too great for words,
"A divorce," ho gasped. "It is a jest.
Why, I have just been married two weeks
this evening.
"I cannot understand how such a report '
could have originated, unless â my wife
was suffering from homesickness and I
told her she had better go home to her i
mother, until, with time, the longing for !
her famiJy should graduaily pass away."!
TWO ELEPHANT STORIES.
Which Show That the Great Beasts
Can KeaHun.
In my opinion tne elephant is the most
intelligent of all animals. He thinks for
himself, and no matter in what position
he may be placed, or what emergencies he
may be called upon to meet, he seems to
be endowed with enough common-sense
to be equal to all occasions. He has also
a strong sense of humor, which *t times is
so marked as to be almost human.
This sense of the humorous was unusu
ally well developed in an elephant I knew
in the Jardin dcs Plantes in Paris, rie
was kept in a great inclosure out in the
open air, so that he had plenty of room to
roam about, in the same inclosure was a
very larc;e hippopotamus, for whose com
fort and amusement a great stone basin
had been built ana filled with water, and
the hippopotamus in turn furnished
amusement' for the elephant It was
quite early one morningâ before the hour
lor admitting the pubiic to the garden
when I noticed the elephant walking
around on the stone edge of the basin,
curiously watching the hippopotamus.
I felt quite sure that the elephant was
up to some prank, and I was not mis
taken; for, just as soon as the ears of the
hippopotamus came into view, the ele
phant qulckiy seized one of them with his
trunk and gave it a sudden pull. The en
jaged hippopotamus lifted hia ponderous
head clear of the water and snorted and
blew; but every time he rose to take
breatli the elephant would recommence
his antics. Around and around the beast
would go, keeping a sharp lookout for tne
little ears of the hippopotamus, which he
would seize the moment they appeared.
His evident delight in teasing his hnee
neighbor was very comical, and there
could be no doubt that he thoroughly en
joyed it.
Again, one day, the keeper placed some
food for the hippopotamus in a corner of
the inclosure, and at once the hippopot
amus began to leave the water to j.-et it;
but the elephant slowly ambled over to
the same corner, and, getting there first
he placed his fore feet over the favorite
food in such a way that the hippopotamus
could not get at it, gently swayed lite
trunk back and forth, and acted alto
gether as though he were there quite acci
dentally, until the garden was thrown
open to the public and he went forward
to receive the daily contributions of
Dread, cake, pie, etc., which were always
offered him by his hosts of admirers.
Elephants appear to take much enjoy
ment in life and exhibit a good-natured
spirit even while at work. In the animals'
quarters at Bridgeport, some time ago, two
little elephants showed evident pleasure in
the tasks that were set for them. Even in
their stable, when no trainer was about,
one little elephant would stand on its bead'
just as it was used to doing in the circus*
and the other would look anxiously on un
til its own turn came to stand on its head
and be admired by the other.

A. T. HATCH, THE FRUIT-GROWER,
YIELDS TO FINANCIAL REVERSES
The Largest Creditors Are Amply Secured by
Mortgages on Highly Cultivated Orchard
Lands in the State.
Failure Is Ascribed to Over
Confidence and Disastrous
Seasons.
A HALF MILLION INVESTED-
Hatch Propagated New Varieties of
Almonds, and by Studious Enter*
prise Developed Markets for
California Products.
A. T. Hatch, the well-known fruit
grower, yesterday acknowledged that he
is bankrupt. His affairs havo been going
from bad to worse since 1893. Four or
five years ago he was accounted the most
successful and one of the richest orchard
ists of the State, but his zeal to extend to
other sections of California the success
A. T. Hatch.
which attended his enterprises in Solano
County caused him to mortgage the mag
nificent orchards and lands in the Suisun
Valley to buy and cultivate vast tracts of
land elsewhere.
It has been known to money-lenders,
bankers and others for the past two years
that his situation in a financial sense was
critical, but not until the Bank of Suisun
foreclosed on the valuable land in that
locality did his friends surrender hope in
his ability to weather the storm.
A. T. Hatch was seen at his office in the
Flood building yesterday and acknowl
edged that he was not able to meet the ob
ligations pressing upon him. When asked
if thestatemeut^elegraphed to The Call
from Suisun yesterday was correct, he
said:
"The Call's report is correct, but in
one of the daily papers it is stated that
neglect of my property was one of the
causes of my failure. This is not true.
There has been no neglect. When
I have not been able to give that
orchard my immediate personal super
vision :t has been in the control of a com
petent superintendent."
"Will many people suffer from your
financial embarrassment?" he was asked.
"Yes," he replied, "some creditors for
small amounts in sums of $2000 and $3000
may be affected seriously. The banks and
other creditors for large sums are secured
by mortgages on the land."
Replying to other questions, Mr. Hatch
said the failure extended to ail ol his
landed investments throughout the State.
He did not blame his creditors for the
action they bad taken. In only one in
stance had proceedings been taken which
were unjust and uncalled-for, but he de
clined to specify that instance.
Responding to the suggestion that he
had economized and denied himself per
sonal comioris in order to tide over the
stress of adversity, he said:
'"Yes, I have lived in a $10 room and
contented myself with 15-cent meals in
order to pull through. My failure now
does not in any sense mean my ruin. I
shall start again and am sure that I will
again succeed. I have the utmost con
fidence in California as a fruit-growing
Btate."
Mr. Hatch added that San Franoisco
merchants would not lose by reason of his
failure.
Among bankers, capitalists ana whole
sale fruit men downtown tbe failure was
discussed. Many had been familiar with
Mr. Hatch's struggles to avoid the col
lapse and were therefore not surprised
that R. D. Robbins of Snisun had lore
closed to collect notes amounting with
accrued interest to $200,000.
The foreclosing crejitor at Suisun is a
correspondent of the Anglo-Caliiornia
Bank, but Mr. Lilient:ial, the manager of
that institution said his bank was to no
wise concerned. "'lt would be a great
benefit to the State," said Mr. Lilienthal
"if California had a few more men lifce
Mr. Hatch. There is not the slightest
semblance of crookedness in his failure.
He simply over- reached himself. He at
tempted to carry a heavier load than he
could b'-ar." ,
A. G. Freeman, the manager of the J.
K. Arnisby Company, spoke in the high
3st terms of Mr. Hatch's enterprise and
ability. "No fruit-grower," he said "has
surpassed Mr. Hatch in intelligence and
â¢r.dustry. His study of fruit culture has
Added vastly to the wealth of the State.
He was the first man to risk the experi
ment of shipping fruit to the Eastern
Â£iarkets by the refrigerator process.
When that plan was adopted only a few
carloads were sent East; now thousands
â }l cars are employed in such shipments.
Hatch maintained model orchards, and
bis example in this respect was not lost
an his neighbors.
"In thÂ« field of almond culture he
achieved the greatest results. He simply
opened a market for California almond's
by propsgating new varieties and study
ing the demands of trade in connection
with th 6 capabilities of the soil. Ye*, Mr.
Hatch has contributed in a large measure
to the development and wealth of Califor
nia, and his misfortunes will surely be re
gretted wherever he is Known."
A. W. Porter of Porter Bros. <fc Co as
serted that A. T. Hatch by active work
and example had rendered the greatest
service to the State, and that his failure
could be regarded in no other light than
that o! a misfortune. "The products of his
almond orchards are known," continued
Mr. Porter, "throughout tie United States.
His methods of cultivating orchards, pick
ing arid packing lruit were the most care
ful. It was a guarantee of excellence in
trade circles to say the fruit or nuts came
from the Hatcn orchards."
H. 11. La Rue, who is winding up the
' affairs of the Grangers' Bank, spoke
highly of Mr. Hatch as an enterprising
man, but had doubts whether Hatch's
efforts had benefited the fruit interests of
the State. The idea was presented that
Hatch had gone too far in his enthusiasm
and had encouraged others to follow him
until the industry of cultivating orchards
had been pushed beyond legitimate de
mands. In consequence of the booming
many orchardists might suffer.
Aiuoiil' Mr. Hatch's liabilities is a note
for $30,000, held by the Grangers' Bank.
The note is secured by a mortgage on an
almond orchard of seventy acres in the
Livormore Valley. The orchard is a
beauty and the land desirable, but the
property will not sell now for a sum suffi
cient to make the bank even on the tran
saction. The bank will probably lose
$20,000.
It was said downtown among the ad
miring friends of Mr. Hatch that if he
had contented himself with the profits of
his Suisun orchards, which in a single
year amounted to $80,000 over and above
all expenses, he would now be lending
money to Banker Robbins. instead of
casting about for means to pay the prin
cipal and interest on a loan of $200,000.
The success scored at Suisuu induced
Hatch to strike out for higher rewards for
his enterprise. He seems to have been
moved by the spirit of his enthusiasm to
invest everything he could borrow in
planting new orchards. He went in with
Colonel Chipman in a great orchard
scheme on th*Â« Feather River. He bought
land and planted trees on a vast tract in
Tehama County. The prospect in Contra
Costa County pleased him and be made
large investments near Martinez. He did
not go to tho heart of the San Joaquin
Valley, but went as far south as Lodi, be
tween Stockton and Sacramento, in his
zeal to acquire orchard property.
Some of the banks went as wild in their
estimates of value as Hatch did himself.
As a capitalist expressed it yesterday:
"Money in excess of the value of the land
was borrowed from certain banks in the
country. The lender figured on trees and
vines as security, and wheu two disastrous
seasons came there was not ample securiiv
for the loans. Hatch, assuming that afl
of his ventures would prove as remunera
tive as his Suisun orchards had in a few
seasons of unexampled prosperity, became
a ereat boomer. He continued to reach
out lor new lands an<i new orchards. His
ventures and his confidence induced bthers
to imitate his example. I have known lor
two years that he was hard pressed. In
the last campaign he was a rabid Bryanite
and one ot the wildest advocate* of free
silver. I was sure then that there was
something wrong with his investments."
It is thought by merchants and bankers
that the failure will be generally regretted
by the people throughout the State. All
agree that Mr. Hatch is a square man in a
business sense and that bis embarrass
ment now is due mainly to disastrous
seasons. One of his warmest friends said:
"Mr. Hatch will come out of his troubles
in time. He is a man who knows bow to
meet adversity and misfortune. You can
fancy a man of his past wealth and afflu
ence living in one little room. His failure
is not due to neelect of his business or per
sonal extravagance. He simply encoun
tered adverse seasons, and by reason of
low prices for orchard products could not
keep ahead, as interest on his notes was
compounding. Ido not know the extent
of his liabilities, but should say that he
had a half million dollars invested."
Tne last public position held by Mr.
Hatch was that of World's Fair Com
missioner from this State. He was ap
pointed by Governor MarKham and served
ou the commission with Irving M. Scott,
James D. Puelan, John Daggett and
others.
REALISM AT THE ALCAZAR
Actor J. T. Sullivan Severely Wounded
in a Stage Duel.
During the second act of the per
formance of "At Fort Bliss," a military
drama, at the Alcazar last night, John T.
Sullivan, one of the leading men, was ac
cidentally seriously cut in the biceps by
his antagonist, Francis Powers, as Colonel
Rogers.
Mr. Sullivan was in the role of Captain
David Van Alstyn, and the duel, which is
as spirited a one as is seen on the stage off
Bosworth F.eld. was a contest for the love
of a woman, Mar arei Burnett, who is
Miss Beatrice ljieb. Misa Burnett herself
is an accomplished swordswoman, and
after the gallant captain is laid low by the
colonel she opportunely appears on the
scene and rakes up the sword where he
dropped it.
During the duel, which was with real
swords, Mr. Sullivan received a slash in
the biceps which made a serious wound
and caused him to be really a wounded
man, which added unexpected and very
dramatic realism to the performance. The
curtain remained down an unusual length
of time and physicians were called ior,
STILL TALKING OF A SECRETARY.
The Miners Not Willing to Let a Matter of Such Vital
Importance Go From the Public Mind.
The subject of a Mining Bureau and a Secretary of Mining in the President's Cabi
net is still being discussed, and words will soon give place to deeds. From all quar
ters come expressions of approval.
Surveyor of the Poit William D. Englishâ The mining industry of the United
States warrants the creation of a Cabinet officer to represent it, and I am heartily in
favor of the proposition. Agriculture has its representation, and why should not
mining? I hear that some of our valley farmers are not in favor of having a mining
secretary. I should think that they would be. The Secretary of Agriculture and
Secretary of Mining would be able to discuss matters of importance to both industries
and decide matters of interest to both, thus saving much friction and feeling and ex
pensive lawsuits between the mining and farming ciasses.
Assistant Postmaster R. H. Dodgeâ l think that by all means the miDing industry
of the United States should be represented in the President's Cabinet. Such a Cabi
net officer would not only look after the interests of the vast gold and silver mines of
the West, but he would look after the interests of the coal, copper and iron mines of
the East ana South. The United States is one of the largest and most important
mining countries in the world, and such an extensive industry should be fully pro
tected by the Government. Yes, indeed, lam most heartily in favor of the creation
of a Department of Mines and Mining and a Secretary thereof.
H. S. Richardson, secretary to the Postmaster-It is a good proposition and one
that I hope to see acted upon by the next Congress. There may be objections to the
creation of such a Cabinet officer, but I have not heard of any yet. At present a vast
amount of business is saddled upon the Treasury Department I believe that the pro
posed department would relieve the Treasury a great deal by taking up, for example,
the coinage of money. Tne Treasury Department would have its hands full in look
ing alter the collection and disbursement of the revenues of the United Btates It
would be a great relief if a new department v;ould look after the working of the United
State Mints, and a Mining Secretary would be just the official to attend to such
matters.

GOODWIN HOME AGAIN.
His Career at : the Antipodes and the
Treatment of Several Different
Ladies.
Nat Goodwin, the comedian, who has
been touring Australia for several months
past, returned here yesterday on the Ala
meda. Maxine Elliott, his leading lady,
about whom and the comedian the gossips
have been talking, returned with him, as
did her sister, Gertrude Elliott.
Goodwin says it is all nonsense about
bis having done a poor business at the
Antipodes, as was toid by Blanche Walsh
and Miss Usner, on their arrival here.
Likewise he treats with fine scorn and is
aghast with surprise at the stories of these
ladies, given at different times, that he did
not treat either of them fairly and finally
sidetracked them for Miss Maxine. The
comedian says be cannot understand how
these reports should be circulated.
He is full of stories, too, about the suc
cess of bis company in Australia. "Why
should I be offered $10, 000 by the man
agers out there if I was a failure?" he
said. "Besides this, I was offered a bonus
of $1000 to stay five months longer and
play "The Citizen" and "The Prisoner of
Zenda."
He says Miss Walsh has not treated
him right, for he paid her for the last two
weeks of her services out of his own
pocket. As for Miss Usner, the comedian
is utterly shocked at her. He says she
sometimes appeared in a garb so pecu
liarly abbreviated that even he found fault
with it.
"You will know It ia pretty bad when I
could do that."
Then the young lady received only $17
a week and he never spoke to her, because
there were some people whose inferiority
he was bound to recognize.
When it came to talking about his rela
tions with Miss Elliott and his suit for
divorce from his wife Mr. Goodwin urged
that they were private affairs. He will
present his new play, "The American
Citizen," next week at the Baldwin.
ITALIANS AROUSED.
They Have Taken Offense at an Kdito
rial Severely Criticizing the Italian
Great indignation is being felt and ex
pressed among Italian residents of this
City over an editorial wbichi appeared in
Tuesday's issue of the Chronicle on tbe
subject of the recently concluded peace
between Italy and Abyssinia, Among
other things the article said:
The treaty of peace made by King Menelek
of Abyssinia for Italy to sign, and which King
Humwrt'i Minister has ratified, marks the
most serious humiliation which any modern,
civilize State has ever received at the hands
of >emi-savages. Great powers. In their war
like operatious against native tribes, have
often been checked, but they have never be
fore concluded a dishonorable peace. One
pitchea battle sufficed to drive Italy out of
Abyssinia and make her a suppliant for favor
at tbe hands of the black Negus. What she
gets by her pleadings Is tbe right to have her
imprisoned soldiers freed, in return for which
she must abandon Ethiopia, recognize its in
dependence and pay Meuelek an indemnity.
The victory of tne Negus is therefore raaae as
complete as was that of Germany over France
in the war of 1870.
Commenting editorially or* the article
in the chronicle i'lialia, the leading local
Italian paper, says:
The Chronicle's notion passes the limits of
honest criticism and becomes a grave insult to
the national sentiment of an enure country,
which nevertheless has some claims ou mod
ern civilization. It is a calumny which nas
no excuse, whether it be actuated by ignor
ance or malice. Tbe telegrams published in
this same Chronic c state mat Menelek bad
carried out the wishes ol tne Ita.ian Govern
ment in the conditions ol peace, and therefore
it is stupid to stigmatize them as dishonorable,
just Â«s it is an lmamous lie to say that Italy
supplicated lavors trum Menelek, when it was
he who was so anxious for peace. Indeed the
Italian papers severely criticized the Govern
ment ior sacrificing tne liberty of the prisoners
so long by not yielding to iie'uelek's desire for
peace sooner.
Another Chronicle lie is saying that Italy
had to pay a war indemnity to Abyssinia. The
only money paid to Menelek was for the main
tenance of the prisoners during eight months.
As for abandoning Ethiopia we retain the
wbole of Erythrea.Meneleic only exacting from
Italy the promise that when sbe wished spon
taneously to renounce the possession she
would restore it to Ethiopia and see that it
was ceded to no other power.
The article in the Chronicle Is then a pre
meditated insult, written with the evident in
tention of humiliating the people against
whom it is directed.
ONE CANVASS FINISHED.
A Democratic Presidential Elector Gets
More Votes Than One of Ills
Republican Rivals.
The Election Commissioners finished up
the canvass of the general ticket yester

There were few changes of importance
in the general ticke:, except in the
Twenty-third Senatorial District, where
Sidney Hall's lead oi twenty votes over
Jack Tyrriil was reduced to 10. This
makes a contest for the seat certain, and
lyrrili's friends are now figuring on a re
count.
The canvass of the votes cast for Presi
dential electors snows that so far as this
City is concerned one Dumocrat comes
within the list of those entitled to go to
tbe Electoral College.
Those receiving the highest vote for
electors are as follows:

CARS OF THE MARKET-STREET
SYSTEM TO CARRY BICYCLES
Manager Vining Now Engaged in Making Practical
Experiments With a Specially Constructed
Device.
Bicycle- Holders Already At
tached to Cars of Two of
the Lines.
THOROTJGH TESTS TO BE MADE
If They Are Satisfactory Cars Will
Be Fitted as Fast as the De.
mand Arises.
General Manager E. P. Vining of the
Market-street Railwa Company has be
gun to make experiments with bicycle-
Bicycle - Holder on Mission - Street Car.
holders on two lines of the system under
bis charge, so as to accommodate such
cyclists as desire to reach the park or the
ferry landing without riding their wheels
through tbe streets oi the City.
At the present time the California-street
line is the only one that permits wheels to
be carried on its cars, and, therefore, has
enjoyed a monopoly of this class of busi
ness. It has, however, provided no spe
cial means for conveniently and securely
transporting the bicycles.
The subject of bicycle transportation on
the lines of the Market-street system has
been under consideration for some time
past, and a few days ago G. W. Douglas,
foreman of car lepairs, received instruc
tions from Mr. Vining to attach a device
that had been invented by the joint talent
of several of the railway men to one or
two of the cars of the company for the
purpose of experiment.
In compliance with this scheme a holder
was put on one of the cars of the Sacra
mento-street road and another on a Mis
â¢ion-street car. That on tbe former is de
signed to accommodate one wheel, while
the one on the latter will carry two ma
chines.
The apparatus is attached to the back of
the rear a ash board, is simple in construc
tion, and is designed to aliow wheels to
be rapidly loaded and unloaded. Two
swinging arms of wrought iron, each
about a foot long, are fastened to the
upper edge of the dashboard. They are
something more than two feet apart, and
from each depends a hook lined with
leather, on which the top bar of the wheel
is intended to rest. To the lower portion
of the dashboard are two swinging rests
on which the wheels of the bicycle are to
rest, and to which they are to be fastened
by straps across tbe rims. It is expected
that this arrangement will bold the ma
chine firmly, and yet protect it from being
bruised and scratched.
In speaking of this new departure ot the
company he represents, Manager Vining
said:
"What we are doing in this line is
simply experimental. We are trying one
of these devices on the Sacramento-street
line, because it will receive a good test
there. The line runs between the ferries
and tbe park and covers some of the most
hilly portions of the City, and therefore
woula be one of the most likely to be used
by wheelmen. We do not yet know just
what will be done on the whole. We first
wish to make sure that our device will
hold the wheels bo as to protect them from
injury, as we do not want to subject our
se.ves to claims for damages, and we also
want to be assured that the wheels can be
handled without too much delay to the car.
Should we find that tbe bicycle-holder fills
the bill in every respect, we shall put them
on wherever we find there is a demand for
them."
A single fare will be charged for each
bicycle carried.
MONTGOMERY VS. RAUER
A Widow Suing for the Patrimony of
Her Children.
The suit of Mrs. Agnes Montgomery, a 9
guardian of her minor children, against
Jacob Raver, came to a conclusion in
J udge Daingeraelct'a court yesterday. She
demanded a balance of $4000 which she
said was due, and he responded by savins
that he had already paid* her $1100 more
than he owed her.*
A great deal of time was devoted to the
argument, the lawyers passing a great
many uncomplimentary rema ks on the
opposing clients.
Attorney Fisher Ames pictured Mrs.
Montgomery to the jury as a shrewd
business woman, who vra3 able to take
care of a big hotel like the Oriel and hold
her own with the sharpers of the business
world, and had even got the better of Jake
Raver, who averaged ninety lawsuits a
month and is never happy except in an
atmosphere of litigation, but who, Mr.
Ames thought, was a gentleman of gen
erous impulses.
Attorney Marcus Rosenthal on the
other hand painted Mr. Raver in very
dark colors, while he described his client,
Mrs. Montgomery, as a confiding, inex
perienced widow, who had trusted Mr.
Raver with the fortune of herself and her
fatherless children and had come to grief
in consequence. He made s: ort of the
claim set up by Mr. Raver that he had
paid Mrs. Montgomery a cent more than
he was compelled to pay.
It was 5 o'clock when Judge Dainger

in this State under the direction of the
State Board of Hortfculture, and it was
he who saved the orange plantations of
California. He introduced the Vedalia
cardinalis and it proved a godsend to the
horticulturists of Southern California. He
also introduced the Rbizobius ventralis,
and that insect has almost completely
wiped out the black scale.
Some time ago the Japanese beetle made
its appearance in the Hawaiian Islands.
It killed all the roses, pinks, orange trees
grape vines, and at one time it bade fair

to devastate the islands. Professor Koe
bele was sent for and he studied the habits
of the pest. He found that it only worked
at night, so he imported a colony of toads
and bats which also feed at nit'ht and on
insects. The pest has almost disappeared
and the Hawaiians are loud in their praise
of the professor.
The coffee plantations in the island re
public were also in danger from a scale
that rendered the berry useless for com
mercial purposes. Koebele studied the
situation and introduced a species of lady
bus that has entirely killed ihe parasite.
He is now on his way to Mexico and Cen
tral America to hunt up some new species
of beneficial insects that will kill off some
other parasites that abound in Hawaii.
He will remain until December, 1897, and
then will probably go to India to kill off
the insects that are blighting the fruit
trees of that country.
BLACKHURST'S BANQUET.
The Volunteers of America Want All
That Is Coining to Them.
Major Blackhurst of the Volunteers of
America proposes to give a dinner on
Thanksgiving day to 1000 children of this
City.
In securing the necessary provisions and
funds from the charitably inclined the
collectors sent out by the major have
found that frequently other people have
preceded them on a similar mission.
"These advance people may be all right
as seeking contributions for charitable
purposes, but," said Major Blackhurst,
yesterday, "if the intention of ihe friends
we have 13 to send us funds and eatables
for our dinner they should reeoznize only
the agents we send to them with th ap
peal for aid written on our letter head,
'Pacific Coast Battalion Headquarters
Volunteers of America, 232 Sutter street,
San Francisco.'
â¢'Oar venture is getting along nicely,
aid we trust that ye will be able to maks
many poor children happy on Thanksgiv
ing day owing to the kind-hearted people
who are helping us.
"If we have any surplus we will dis
tribute it among the poor families of this
City with whose needs we have already
become acquainted."
WANT A CONTRACT LET.
ImproTement *- labs Desire Polk Street
Cat Through From Greenwich to
Lombard at Once.
The Van Ness Improvement Club, by
President H. E. Law, and the Polt-street
Improvement Club, by President Robeit
Dross, filed petitions with the Board of
Supervisors yesterday, requesting that a
contract for grading down tbe hill on Polk
street, between Greenwich and Lombard
streets, be let at once.
It is probable that unless a lack of
funds prevents the Supervisors will act
favorably on the petition.
Attorney Gartland of the Street Depart
ment sent a communication to the Super
visors yesterday requesting that no more
contracts be let during the rest of this
month in view of the provsions of the
law, which says t at no more than one
twelfth of the funds of any department
shall be expended during any one month.
He says that work now in progress will
eat up the Novemb-r share of tbe Street
Department funds, and that more conÂ«
tracts will only cause complications.
