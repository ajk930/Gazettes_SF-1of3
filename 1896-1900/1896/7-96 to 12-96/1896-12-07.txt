1 After the Criminal Courts Have Done
With the Casj^tha Grand Jury
May Take It Up.
The evidence inculpating a select circle
in tfie fraud perpetraieu recently when
Bob -FiizHinmons and Tom Sharkey
foirght in the Pavilion is narrowing down
to the half dozen mainstays who are re
sponsible for the scanaal that has heen
bruited throughout the world, aud that
. must necessarily be a serious setback to
j qua re pugilistic sport on this coast.
The civil courts are first to take up the
matter" in connection with the rightful
ownership of the $10,000 check. This bit
of paper was handed over to Wyatt Earp
â¢ by- James G. Cnesley, on the evening ot
ttie'eontest. and from that repository it
passM into the hand 3of Sharkey's alter
ego, D-inny Lynch.
.Since then there have been people
galore descending upon Earp and Lynch
with- lecal power to prevent them from
disposing of the cbecc without first paying
up long-standing judgments rendered
aeainst them for honest debts they have
heretofore ignored. But these clamoring
itors have counted without their
ho;-ts.' Neither Earp nor Lynch knows
wheie the check is.
Karp calms that he turned it over to
. Lynch, an 1 the latter says he gave it to
-.j ': : some "man,* Dowel], for safekeeping, ac
â¢:' cprdinij to instructions from Sharkey.
/â [ Tne latter denies he ordered Lynch to do
â¢ : : 4ny such tiling, and there the matter lies.
-;Earp failed to show up in court when
.. â¢ Mibpenaed in this matter, and a warrant
â ".â â . for ljis arrest will bring him there when
the' c^se comes up.
â¢"Â«.'. â¢*Unv* yer, his absence has placed him
beyond .the pale of the lav/, so far as per
â jury is concerned. But it is noW so with
key and Lynch, who have each sworn
rto contradictory statements, which will
:t>e brought up later in the criminal pro
.teedings that are to be instituted.
.:â¢â  Tne criminal piosecution is to follow
/rtbe riyil suit. Robert Fhzsirnmons, Mar
...tin'-Ju'iian and their attorney, H. I. Kow
al-ky, declare positively that there is
noihing that will stop them from prose
cuting every individual implicated in the
-piracy to not only rob Fitzsimmons
but t lie public.
Celonel Kowalsky declared positively
last night that he had enough evidence on
hand at that time to send a hali-dozen
men to jail.
â 'We will take this affair in natural
sequence," he said; "first we will get the
$10,000 belonging to us. The other side
aas ten days in which to answer. That
wfll give them enough rope with which to
bang themselves, and then we will take
up.the conspiracy matter."
One of the points that will be shown as
indicative of fraud is the tfrrinc jump in
the 'betting from $100 to $30 on Fitzsim
rnons to $100 to $<35 within a f o w hours af
ter it was known that Wyatt Earp was se
lected as referee.
The selection of Earp as a referee has al
ready-caused great comm-nt, ana not un
til recently has it come to light why he
was chosen.
His past modeof making a livelihood by
tjie use of his "gun" has been told. He
has been a man who has shot down people
innumerable, wiped the smoke from off
the barrel of his shotgun and cut another
notch in the butt, and said "What a great
wali 8m I."
The public would have preferred to have
Hiram Cook or Lem Fulda as referee, as
honesty and fairness was all that was
needed to properly fulfill the duties of the
office. But it was not so with those who
were interested in the outcome of a fight
in which the public must get the "worst
of it."
"Long Green" Lawrence wanted Earp
as a referee and he put him therp. Every
body does not quite understand what
"Long Green" means. It is not the
growfh of grass, but the makeup of Rreen
backs. "Out for the lonj: green" is a com
mon expression in speakintr of an indi
vidual whose weather eve is cast on the
main chance to telegraph ias dextrous
fingers when to grp ttie crisp notes.
It goes with that old advice given by
some sage, "To ninke a living honestly,
but if you can't make it honestly to make
it anyhow."
Another point it is expected to show
is that Sharkpy was never fouled duri::g
Jjis battle wit!) Fiiz*irainon?. The phys -
cians who tried to see him immeditUely
after he was hurt and were only perniitt*d
io do so Â»-ipht<en hours iater, after Dr.
Lee n;'d been permitted to do hi? bidding.
\<iJl testify that Sharkey's injuries might
haVeÂ° been caused by many different
methods any schemer raieht adopt to earn
fltfOOO.
Anyhow, "Lone Green" Lawrence,
njaruudrvg editor "of the Examiner, his
body guard, Wyatt Earp. Danny Lynch,
fcliarkey, Groom and Gibb3 will nave a
h.Tppy time explaining themselves out of
the niess into which they have got them
selves.
THE CLUB'S STATEMENT.
/^'Correction That Corrected Noth
Â° . "* Ing and Needs Correction
*' . . ' Itself.
' '.Jt-J. Groom and J. D. Gibbs tl the two
managers of the National Athletic Club,
called at the editoiial rooms pf The Call
early yesterday morning â too late, How
cever, for their purpose to be given space in
1 t^ese column until this issue. '
I ' 'We havo come to present you with
\ this communication in regard to an arti
cle published in The Call this s morning,"
they said, and then submitted the follow
ing communication : , .
; To the Editor of the Call: In the matter pub
lished in The Call of this morning reÃarding
\h". late contest between Fitzsimmons and
tharkey, the opening paragraphs are as fol
low-; â  Â,.â¢,-....â - â /-. -
"The true facts relating to the appointment
jm& v Ssdk< '^m M Â¥
of Wyatt Earp, the bodyguard of Andy M.
Lawrence, the managing editor of the tx
nnuner, otherwise known Â«s hong Green Law
rence, as reieree of the light, have come to
lighi. -
â¢â¢He was appointed at the Instance of Law
rence."
We wish to deny flatly and completely the
truth of these statements. The fuil facts con
cerning the appointment of Earp ure as fol
lowa:
Mr. Earp was a stranger to Mr. Gibbs and
myself. We had met nim but onc-3 pri> rto his
appointment as referee and on the occasion of
a visit to Fitzsimmaus' traluine quarters about
ten days before the contest, when we received
a formal introduction to him.
The managers of the principals were argu
ing ior several days over the appointment of
a referee and it became manifest as the day of
the contest approached that they would make
no selection, that they could not agree upon
any one, and Mr. Gibbs and 1 talked over the
matter, as it was important that we should be
prepared at 12 o'clock, noon, ot December '2 to
name the reteree in the event that the man
agers of the principals failed to do so. In dis
cussing the matter Mr. Gibbs stated that he
had in mind a man who would give entire sat
isiaction, as he was reported io be fearless,
cool and honest. H said that such a man as
Andy Lawrence of the Examiner, Mr. Bunker
of the Report atid Mr. Simpson of the Chroni
cle spoke in terms of ptaise of him and we
could make no mistake in selecting him. I
said, "If he is good enough for the press he is
good enough for me."
At 12 o'clocs, noon, of December 2 Martin
Juiian and Dan Lynch informed me that it
was impossib.e for them to agree on a referee;
that they placed tbe matter la the hands ot
the National Athletic Club. Then they left.
Tnis conversation occurred at my place of
business, on Market street, under the Baldwin
Ho lei.
Mr. Gibbs arrived shortly afterward, and I
told him that the duty of selecting a referee
had been turned over to us. He said, "How
about Wyatt Earp?" Â«na 1 said, "He suits me."
We then walked through the Baldwin Hotel
lobby to the bar. We saw Mr. Earp in con
versation with a friend. I said to Gibos:
"This is a strange coincidence. There is Earp
sitting mere." We called Mr. Esrp to one
siiiu and informed him that the National Atti
letie Club had chosen him as referee of :he
Flis*immonÃ-&harkey contest. He hesitated a
moment and said, "Well, I consider it au honor,
aud consent to serve."
I asked him if he understood the rules of the
game thoroughly, and he replied in the affirm
ative. This is tue fall history of his selection.
At that time both Mr. Gibbs and myself told
him that as the people Â«e>e giving high prices
to see the contest, we would not like to
have it cut off by a technical foul. All we de
sired was to give tne principals and the public
a good, square deal.
i hat is ail there is to it. Mr. Lawrence had
absolutely nothing to do with the selection of
Earp.
The statement attributed by The Call as
coming from Mr. Gibbs, said to be made ou the
afternoon After the fi>:ht io a reporter of the
Examiner is as follows: "What kick have you
got coming? It was at Andy Lawrence's sug
gestion that Wyatt Earp went in as referee," is
absolutely untrue. Mr. Gibbs never made that
statement.
The statement is also made, "Lawrence told
Gibbs that he understood the fighters were dis
agreeing as to the (election of a reteree." This
Is not go. Mr. (ilbba introduced the subject,
and spoke ot the difficulty that was being cad
in the selection oi a reteree.
Mr. Ltwrence did not say as reported in The
Call, -'I have got you a man. Select Wyntt
Earp. I know he is ns good a man as you can
get. and there will be no kicking against him."
The Call report says: "That is a true state
ment ot how we decided upon Wyatt Earp as
re ft reÂ«."
That is an absolutely untrue statement as to
how the selection of Mr. Earp as referee was
made. (Signed) J. J. Groom,
J. D. gibus.
S -.n Francisco, Dec. 5, 1896.
The communication as published was
acoepteo. and a few inquiries made as to
w hy such a statement should be made in
direct contradiction of the interview given
by botL Gibbs and Groom in the presence
of two reporters attached to different
newspapers.
"Did you not come here from the Ex
aminer editorial rooms, gentlemen?" was
asked.
"Yes, sir," answered the commissioners.
"We came from Mr. Lawrence to try and
straighten this thing out.
"We want to have it understood that we
were the ones who appointed Mr. Earp.
It would be derogatory to our dignity to
have it understood otherwise. The way
it occurred was that snch men as Mr.
Lawrence and Mr. Simpson recommenced
him as a good man, and we selected him."
"Do you not know, gentlemen, that Mr.
Simpson, the city editor o# the Chronicle,
was thoroughly unacquainted with Mr.
Earp, excepting that Lieutenant Esola of
the Police Department came to him some
days before the fight asking fora lickptfor
a friend. Being asked who that friend was,
he stated it was Wyatt Earp?"
fioth Gibbs amd Groom stuttered their
doubt about that point.
Now as to the derails of the Groom,
Ginbs, Earp, Esola, Lawrence and Mr.
Simpson mix up:
Lieutenant Esola a^ked Mr. S rupson for
a pass to the tight for Wyatt Earp. Mr.
Simpson said he did not feel justified in
asking for a pass or ticket from the Na
tional Athletic Club. He said he was not
acquuitjf-d with Wyatt Earp and was not
inclined to ask favors anyhow iv such af
fairs.
Last night Mr. Simpson was not in his
office, but Fred Stoweil, his representa
tive, stated positively that any claim made
by either J. J. Groom or J. D. Gibbs that
Mr. Simpson had iv any way suggested,
intimated or otherwise given an idea he
would be pleased to see Wyatt Earp taken
as referee in the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey
fight was absolutely a lie.
But, going back a few days, the false
hoods told in the communication of Gibbs
and Groom are made more apparent.
The very day after the Earp decision,
which robbed Fitzsimmons of the vctory
justly due him, and at ihe time the public
was clamoring to know why Gibbs had
chosen Earp as a referee, two reporters â
Messrs. Sullivan nnd Scott â were to the
front and spoke to Mr. Gibbs at the junc
tion of Market and Ellis streets. It was
in answer to Mr. Sullivan's inquiry that
Gibbs said tlmt Lawrence and Simpson
had suggested Earp.
Mr. Scott subsequently reported back to
his office and learned that Gibbs had told
a falsehood and he had an opportunity on
Friday night to push the words backinto
Mr. Groom's mouth. On this occasion
G.bbs was not present and his associate.
J. J. Groom, was the spokesman for the
tirm.
"Andy Lawrence and Simpson sug
gested Wyatt Earp as referee, and that's
why we appointed him, 1 ' he said.
â¢â¢You know that is not so, Mr. Groom,"
declared Mr. Scott. J"Mr. Simpson had
nothing to do with it. He never knew
Wyatt Earp until Mr. Lawrence's friend
and companion, Lieutenant Esola, men
tioned his name in an application for a
pass."
Groom immediately backed down from
bis j ostlion and nid that was probably so,
Imt that "anyhow Lawrence indorsed
Earp as a proper party to referee the

bodyguard and eun tighter, into the rins

The acknowledgment of Gibbs and
Groom that they came direct from Law
rence to The Call editorial rooms with
their communication typewritten on the
Examiner telegraphic papt-r and the false
statements made by tne entire clique,
would lead to the belief that the G:and
Jury will find quite a nest of which this
trio will form a nucleus, when they begin
their investigation to punish those who

EARP'S SPOKANE RECORD.
There Is No One There Who Can
Say a Good Word for
Him.
SPOKANE, Wabii., Dec. 6. â Wyatt
Earp is known in this city, and the many
old-time Cceur d'Aleners have no good
words to say of him. They cnarge him
with being the head of a pang of lot-jump
ers in Eagle City in 1884, which termi
nated in quite a fight between his Mane
and W. JNI. Buzzard, a man who refused to
be bluffed by them. Earp, it is said, was
the brains and general of tne gang, among
which were Hill Payne, Ferguson. Hol
ir.an and Jack Enright, all noted charac
ters of the oarly days of Eagle City. Jack
Enright was a nervy man who did the
gun-play act, while Earp, in bis saloon,
dance hall and gambling-house, arranged
the plans nnd set the gan<; to work. W. M.
Buzzard, the man who had the fight with
them, was found this afternoon by your
correspondent and tola the story of his
fight witn the eang.
"I went to Eagle City in the early part
of 1884," said Mr. Buzzard. "The Earp
gang, headed by Wyatt Earp, were then
lot-jumping. They would take a lot away
from som one by lorce and sell it to an
innocent purchaser. Then some others of
the gang would come around, drive the
man off and re-sell it. Eagle City was a
booming and new mining canip. and
there were many desperate churacier-i in
the place. I had secured a lot and started
to build a hotel, when the EÂ»rp gang put
up the jot> to take it away from me. Jack
Enright came up and told me to leave,
and I promptly told him I would not. I
went to the cabin and got my eun to be
prepared for them, for I saw trouble. In
a few minutes the whole gang came up
the trail, which, being packed down below
with the surrounding snow, afforded good
breast-works. They all opened fire on me
at once. 1 dropped behind a log, but a
man at my side was killed. We then kept
up a continual fire for tome time, 1 from
behind the log and they from the trail,
being sixty feet apart. I bad three holes
put through my hat, while Jack Enright
had a piece cut out of his cheek by mv
bullet.
"A Jarge crowd was attracted to see the
fight and finally, being assured 1 would
have fair play, I gave up to Deputy Sheriff
Hunt. No one was arrested.' This was
the first time the gaig had been resisted
and it rather broke the practice, but at
the same time the iarap 'busted,' for the
reputation of the Earp gang kept people
who wanted property away. Of course, 1
don't know it Earp shot at me, or, if he
aid. how many time?, but Ido know he
engineered the scheme and was in the
gang. I think he devoted his time to
getting cartridges for the balance of the
gang. Earp was consiJered a bad and
unscrupulous man. He was not particu
larly brave in pun plays, but he was al
ways considered 'out for the dough.' "
Many other early-timers in the Cceur
d'Alenes were seen to-day by your corre
spondent, none of whom had anything
good to say of Earp. He was generally re
garded as a bad man at taat lime and in
that camp.
AN OVATION TO BOB.
Twelve Thousand People Cheer the
Fighter Who Was Defrauded
of His Rights.
If the people of Ban Francisco were not
of the opinion that Bob Fitzsimmons was
unjustly dealt with on the night of ihe
rignt with Sharkey and that he had been
deirauded of his just dues by the decision
of Referee Earp, it is certain that they
would not have turned out en masse as
they did to see him yesterday afternoon
give an exhibition of bag-punching and
show the blow that knocked out the
"Pride of the Navy." There were fully
12.000 people in the crowd whicn as
sembled.
As soon as Fitzsimmons reachea the
boxing platform he threw off his gown,
and as soon as he was recognized he was
greeted with a hurrah that rent the air.
CLOSE OF THE SEASON.
It was a perfect ovation, such as probably
few if any Doxer Â«ver receive
As he advjnced tiward idjÂ» punchine
bag some one called for â¢â¢three cheers for
the man who Knocked out Sbarkev," and
they were given with a will. He then
went at the bag, punching it nÂ»rht and
left in a manner that aroused the enthusi
asm of the audience to 'he highest decree,
and his performance was vociferously
cheered.
After that Fitzsimmons and Dan
Hickey, his trainer, gave a three short
round exhibition, in which there was
some pretty spurring and many pood
give-and-lake blows, and n fine di -
play of the manner in which Ftzsimmons
dur-k 1 * to avoid punishnn-nt. The third
round closed with a right-hand uppercut
which staggered Hickey and he went
down. Fitzsimmons turned tothe crowd
and said, "That it the kind of blow that
laid out Sharkey." This was received
with loud cheers and cries for a speech.
Fitzsimmons again faced the crowd and
said, "I ain't got much to say, except that
I am ready at any time to fijrht ShnrÃey
for any amount," and the crowd cheered
lustily.
"So More rights.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. Câ Dan Stuart
arrived here from Dallas, Tex., this even

stomach trouble that recently ailed him
and remained in his rooni3 at the Planters'
j Hotel. At 11 o'clock he left for New York.
During Ihe ten minutes' interview he gave
to reporters he stated that the Fitzsim
mons-Sharkey fight had settled nothing,
but had done much to injure pugilism.
"There will never be another first-class
meeting in San Francisco," said he. "The
men who pay to see square coniests will
nev*Â»r aram assemble on the Pacific Coast.
If the affair had been under the manage
ment of my club there would have been
no after proceedings in which a law court

STRICKEN WITH A HEMORRHAGE.
Fatal Illness of Mrs. Matthews, Wifa of
the Governor of Indianaâ Her
Daughters Summoned.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 6.â Mrs.
Matthews, wife of Governor Matthewa,
was seized with a fatal hemorrhage of the
stomach to-night. She had been indis
posed for a couple of days, but was feeling
so much better this evening tuat she was
up and about, and she and the Governor
were alone in the library about 8:30 o'clock
when she started to walk across the room
and fell to the floor with blood rushing
from her Dionth and nostrils.
The Governor carried her to a couch and
the family physician, Dr. R. French Store,
was called at once. He saw the fatal
nature of the trouble and teleprams were
iÂ»ent to their two daughters, Mr?. Cortez
Ewinc of Greensburg and Miss Helen
Matthews, now attending the Cincinnati
Conservatory of Music. A consultation of
physicians was called, but they found that
Mrs. Matthews had but a few hours to
live. Mrs. Matthews was a daughter of
Governor Whitcornb and they have been
married nearly thirty years. The Gover
nor's only son, Seymour Matthews, died
at Atlanta a year ago.

Various Bills, Including Collis P. Hun

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 6.â lt is not
likely that anything will be done in either
house of Congress to-morrow except to ex
change congratulations or condolence, as
the case may be, over tne result of theelec
tion, and to listen to the President's mes
sapc. When the last session closed the
House immigration bill had, and now has,
the right of way in the Senate. It is the
unfinished business, and will be called up
at the expiration of the morning hour.
Although known as the House bill on the
calendar as reported to the Senate by Mr.
Lodge, it is a materially different measure,
all of the House provisions having been
stricken out except the enacting clause
and a new bill substituted. This biil will
be called up on Tuesday by Senators
Lodge and Chandler, who desire to push it
to a vote as quickly as possible.
An effort will be made to secure new
dates for the consideration of special
orders that were not reached auring last
session. These measures are: Senate bill
to prevent the desecration of the Ameri
can flags; House bill to amend the act to
prevent the extermination of fur-bearing
animals of Alaska; House bill to reduce
the cases in which the penalty of death
may be inflicted, and Senate joint reso
lution proposing an amendment to the
constitution providing for tne election of
Senators by popular vote.
An important bill, over which there
bus developed a bitter fight, is the Detroit
bridge bill for a bridge across the Detroit
Kiver. It was postponed at the last session
until the first Monduy in December.
In addition to the appropriation bills
there are several measures that will con
tend with each other for the right of way.
Piominent among these are the bills to
refund the Pacific Railroad debt, to admit
the Territories ot New Mexico and Ari
zona and Mr. Davis' resolution relative io
the assertion and enforcement o? theMon
roÂ»* doctrine.
In ihe House of Representatives the
death of ex-Speaker Crisp will be an

BAD BOYS BREAK AWAY.
Twenty-Eight Escape From the Nebraska
State Industrial School, but Many
Are Recaptured.
KEARNEY, Nebr., Dec. 6.â Twenty
eight of the larger boys contined in the
State Industrial School near here escaped
last night. The break was made from the
dining-room and many of them carried
kmves used at the table. The plan has.
been brewine some time, over a hundred
being implicated and all would have
escaped had not an attendant drawn his re
volver and threatened to shoot the first
boy that started. To-day all but fifteen
were recaptured. Those still out are the
most desperate and are believed to be
headed for Kansas.
"Kid" Thrasher, the leader, was cap
tured about midnight, bu: his main as
sistant, Y'ates of Omaha, is still at large.
Some of the boys are armed with butcher
knives and sugar-beat knives, and will re
sist arrest if the opportunity offers.

FASTEST IN THE ROYAL NAVY.
Great Speed and Power Attained During
the Trial Trips of the British
Cruiser Fowsriul.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Dec. 6.â A special
cable dispatch to the Herald from London
says: The British cruiser Powerful, which
quite recently completed her steam trials,
is at the present moment the fastest ship
in the royal navy, and has thus fully
justified the adoption of waier tube boil
ers in vessels of large displacement. The
engines of the Powerful, as also tho c of
the Terrible, were designed to produce
20,000 horsepower. In her final trip, which
was carried out on November 27, her en
gines developed an average ot 23,886 horse
power for ibe requisite period of four
hours. For one-tliird of the duration of
her trial the power exceeded 26.000 horse
power. Tiie wind whs strong ami the sea
roujh, the result being that the speed at
tained was only 21.8 knots, but it was
estimated that in tolerably smooth water
the ship would have steamed at a speed of
fully '2214 knots. The ship was fully down
to her load line during the trials, and
drew twenty-eight feet aft.

This Will Cause Two Diplo
matic Announcements in
Cleveland's Message.
Clcse of a Celebrated Dispute Through
the Peaceful Channels of Inter
national Arbitration.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 6. âThe
probable assent of Venezuela in the pro
posed treaty of arbitration of the British
Guiana boundary dispute negotiated
through the pood offices ot the United
States and the practical conclusion of a
general arbitration convention between
Great Britain and the United States, it is
stated, will form two of the most import
ant diplomatic announcements in the
President's message to Congress.
What is understood to be in nearly all
essential particulars a copy of the prelimi
nary agreement entered into some weeks
aero between Secretary Olney and Sir
Julian Pauncefote in the Venezuelan mat
ter is made public. Tne draft of the pro
posed treaty itself, which the Venezuelan
Minister, Mr. Andrade, carried with him
to Caracas to lay before .his Government, is
more elaborate than this agreement.
It starts with a preamble of considerable
length, and in that portion which refers to
the fifty-year occupation of territory in
dispute embodies other point 3 besides
mere occupancy and political control,
which will be taken into consideration by
the tribunal.
These are expressed in technical terms
international lawyers will understand,
but which would not be readily compre
hended by others.
Advices received from Caracas do not
bear the impression that the Venezuelan
Cabinet is dissatisfied with the treaty, or
that Minister Andrade, who will shortly
return to the United States, will bring
with him the draft of a new treaty a^
modified by the Venezuelan authorities.
On the contrary, there are grounds for the
belief that President Cre*po and his con
stitutional advisers have given their full
adhesion to the proposed treaty.
Under ti ese circumstances it will be
signtd by Minister Andrade, representing
the South American republic, and bf Sir
Julian Pauncefote, on the part of Great
Britain, after which the United States will
drop out of the matter, well satisfied to
have been the medium of bringing the
two countries together ami of effectine a
settlement of their loiir dispute through
the peaceful channels of an international
board of arbitration.
It was only in this way, it is asserted on
high authority, that such a conclusion
could have been reached, as diplomatic
relations between Venezuela and Great
Britain have long been suspended, and it
was well known that her Majesty's Gov
ernment would not consent that Ven
ezuela should havo any voice in tne selec
tion of the board.
While it is entirely true that the ratifi
cation of the treaty must still depend
upon the will of the Venezuelan Congress,
no doubt is felt that the body will indorsa
President Crespo's action.
In regard to a general treaty of arbitra
tion between the United States and Great
Britain it is slated that tue President's
message will show that the negotiations
are practically concluded and that it will
be Ihe President's pleasuro within a few
weeks at the utmost to lay the treaty be
fore the Senate for its consideration. It is
substantially finished now, excepting a
few matters of detail that are still me sub
ject of correspondence, but respecting
which there will be little if any additional
delay.

"TAKEN IN."
" I used often to read the newspaper aloud
tomywife,"said Bert Robinson, "and once
I was fairly ' taken in ' by a patent medicine
advertisement The seductive paragraph
began with a modest account of the sea-
serpent, but ended by setting forth the vir-
tues of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discov-
ery, which, it was alleged, was a cure for
all Bronchial, Throat and Long troubles,
and would even cure Consumption, if taken
in time. The way I was taken in was this :
I had lung disease, and I bought a bottle
of the remedy; I was a stranger to it. and it
took me in â and cured me." Robinson's
experience is identical with that of thou-
sands of others. So true is this, that after
witnessing, for many years, the marvelous
cures of Bronchial, Throat and Lung affec-
tions wrought by this wonderful remedy,
its manufacturers feel warranted in say-
in? that this remedy will cure gS per
cent, of all eases of consumption, if taken
in the earlier stages of the disease. Thi9
may seem like a bold assertion to those
familiar only with the means generally in
use for its treatment; as, nasty cod liver oil
and its filthy emulsions, extract of malt,
whiskey, different preparations of hjpo-
phosphites and such like palliatives.
The photographs of a large number of
those cured of consumption, bronchitis, lin-
gering coughs, asthma, chronic nasal catarrh
and kindred maladies, have been skillfully
reproduced in a book of 160 pages which will
be mailed to you, on receipt of address and
six cents in stamps. You can then write
those cured and learn their experience.

SOCIALISTS RUN
THE DOCK STRIKE
Otherwise the Difficulty
Would Have Been
Settled.
Employers Refused to Submit to
Arbitration Because of This
Political Move.
Emperor William Trying to Suppress
the Scandal Growing Out of
the Trial of Editors.
f Copyrlsfct, 1896, by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Dec. 6.â Passing
from its initial phase as a mere industrial
agitation in pursuit of higher wage 3, the
strike of the dock laborers at Hamburg
and elsewhere has become a matter of
political importance. Behind the local
organizers of the Hamburg strike, as it
lias now been revealed, is the executive
comnittee of the Socialist party, which
is not working so much in the interests of
the laborers as in the interests of the
Social Democratic party. The execu
tive committee of the Socialist party
is now established in headquarters at
Hamburg, and it has managed to get the
trades unions throughout Germany to
supply funds for the support of stiikers at
all Baltic ports. What is called a laborers'
common resistance fund has been formed,
to which the Socialist associations in
every great center are contributing. The
object of this movement is less to conquer
the employers than to foster the Socialist
propaganda.
If the dock laborers at Hamburg bad
been left to themselves they would have
speedily settled their dispute with the
masters, who proffered to tneir old em
ployes concessions equal to what the
strikers originally demanded. Since the
Socialist leaders have intervened, how
ever, the demands ol the strikers have in
creased until now the employers find
themselves face to face with the real
issue, wbich is that the entire shipping
industry of Germany must obey the dic
tates of the politico-social organization or
fight out a supreme battle to the end.
The rejection by the employers of the pro
posal to submit the dispute to a board of
arbitration was due to the knowledge of
the employers of the fact that the men be
' hind the strikers would not eventually
accept the decision of the arbitration
tribunal, whirl), as proposed, conceded
only one member to represent the em
ployers. It was not the absence of ade
quate representation on the tribunal that
caused the employers to reject the pro
posal, but it was their conviction of the
futility of the whole proceeding.
The movement is now said to be a com
bined Socialist attack upon German com-
merce and German capital in which the
Government will soon be bound to inter
.- fere. Tne Emperor sent an agent to see
personally Senator Hachmann of Ham-
burg, Herr Hinriciise'n, the president of
the Hamburg Burgerschaft, and Herr
Noack, the president of the Hamburg
Chamber of Commerce, all of whom ad
. vised the formation of an arbitration tri
bunal to which the dispute between the
, employers and the strikers should be ad
mitted lor settlement. The Kaiser him
self strongly favored the earliest possible
â  settlement of the difficulty until he was
shown that the Socialist politicians were
managing the strike, when it is understood
ius Majesty advised the Home Office to
awuit toe developments of the situation,
but not to interfere. In the meantime
General von Schlewitz, commanding the
â¢ troops at Hamburg, has been instructed
to take full measures to maintain order.
The best journalists of Germany, those
â¢whose probity cannot be impeached, are
hopeful that the grandest result from the
revelations of the trial of the five editors â
Baron von Luetzow and Herren Pioetz,
Fcellmar, Lectert and Berber â for libel
ing Baron Marschall von Bieberstein,
Prince Alexander von Hohenlohe ana
Count August von Eulenburg, will be the
extinction of the gang of members of the
" German press who are feeding upon doubt
ful official information. If larger latitude
â¢ were allowed to press criticism less cor
ruption would be practiced, the independ-
I .ence of the press would be greater and the
position of earnest and self-respecting
journalism wouid be enhanced. .While
the Foreign Office and many others of the
Government departments continue to in
fluence tne newspapers, inciting them to
publish this, that or the other, bribing
. newspapers by giving" them information
â¢ which is sometimes true and often false,
according to the interests of the depart
ment furnishing it, there is little hope of
reform of the existing abuse-.
The leading public men who are getting
their names smirched by the revelations
01 the present trial may be led to -recog
nize the tact that ttieir support of the rep
tilians of the press endangers themselves
more than it hurts anybody else. A pro
tracted conference was held last evening
at the Chancellory between the Imperial
Chancellor, Prince von Hohenlohe, Baron
Marschall von Bieberstein, Minister of
Foreign Affairs; Dr. SchonsUdt, Minister
of Justice, and Freiherr von der llecke
Vonderhorst, Minister of the Interior. The
conference was ueld at the command of
the Kaiser for the purpose of arranging a
limit to the developments of the trial of
Baron von Luetzow and his associate de
fendants, as for reasons of state it is re
garded by the Emperor as desirable that
the revelations shall not be pursued much
if any further. It is whispered that Baron
von Tauscb, the c'.ief of the political po
lice, who will probably be accused of be
ing accessory to the forgeries and Irauds
committed by Baron von Luetzow, had
backers of the highest influence in con
nection with the part he took in the scan
dalous acts, and it is rumored that this
fact furnishes one of the strongest reasons
for a desire to suppress further revela
tions.
Apart from the trial of the rive editors
and the scandals attached, thereto, the
chief topic of discussion in /Berlin social
circles prows out of the circumstances of
the production of Wildenbruch's '-Kaiser
Heinrich" at the Berliner Theater; on
Tuesday last, and Gerhardt Hauptmann's
"Sunken Bell"at the Deutsche Theater on
Wednesday. Since the Emperor awarded
the two Schiller. prizes to Wildenbruch,
overruling the decision of the committee
in favor of Hauptmann, the leud which
broke out between the partisans of the two
authors ha3 become most acute. The Em
peror favored Wildenbruch and esthetic
Berlin, especially of the ; young German
school, were fanatically in iavorof Haupt
rnann. In consequence seats for the first
nights at both theaiers were selling at a
premium for weeks in advance, as high as
-0 maiks being paid merely for standing
room in the B Timer Theater by the cream
ol Berlin society.v The Emperor and Em
press gave the signal for applause, which
at the samo time was ns spontaneous as it
was strong. -Kaiser Heinrich" is a pow
erful work, though possibly it is not
Wildenbruch's best. The Emperor 'per
hOiially congratulated Wildenbruch at the
conclusion of the performance,
The Deutsclie Theater was packed with a
less aristocratic but more enthusiastic
audience than that which filled the Ber
liner Theater, ana the applause was almost
continuous. Herr Hauptmann was called
before the curtain and the audience gave
him an ovation, as a protest of the young
Germans against the Kaiser's award of the
prizes to Wildenbruch in opposition to the
decision of the committee.
A decree has been issued by the Home
Office in regard to the testing of wines by
chemical process, which insists that ac
curate records shall be made on the pure
and adulterated wines and the adulterants
employed clearly defined. , .
The Hessian court has given a decision
upon the question of injurious or healthful
methods of drinking which is being widely
quoted. A restaurant-keeper, in making
an application for a license to sell spirits,
pleaded that it was necessarily conducive
to health that a class of cognac should bo
taken before a person drank a quantity of
beer.
A number of eminent chemists and
othersiwere called as expert witnesses,
among them Professor Gaffky of the Gies
sen Hyeienic Institute, and their lesti-
I inony persuaded the court to decide that,
although a small portion of brandy would
have a salutary effect, it would be better
that bread should be eaten before a quan
tity of beer was consumed.

Will Testify in th? JUibel Trial of the
Pipe. Kditors.
BERLIN, Germany, Dec. 6. â Count
Philip Eulenberg, the German Embas
sador to Austria, arrived here to-day. He
will appear as a witness to-morrow in the
action against Baron yon Luetzow and
four editors for libeling Marschall yon
Bieberstein, Prince Alexander yon Honen
lohe and Count August zu Eulenburg.
Major yon Tausch. eti ief of the political
police, who, according to a confession
made by yon Luetzow at the trial on Fri
day, was deeply implicated in attacks on
prominent State officials, Has been sus
pended from duty, owing to the revela
tions made at the trial.
The case is the principal topic of con
versation in political circle?, and tue
deepest interest attaches to the outcome
of the proceedings. Much curiosity is
manifested as to the evidence that will be
given by Count Philip Eulen burg, to whom
Major yon 'iausch wrote with the object of
inducing him to tell Emperor Wiliiam
about an alleged conspiracy between the
Foreign Ministers and members of the
Emperor's circle to ruin certain officials.
Major yon Tausch whs very much op
posed to Baron Marschall yon Bieber
stein and thought by exciting the Em
peror's suspicions against him ne could
succeed in having him dismissed from
office.
It is said that the prospect of further
revelations being made has caused dismay
among certain persons in high court cir
cles, who fear that it will show that they
were implicated in the intrigues against
certain of the Ministers.

CAM NOT ACCEPT THE TOKEN.
Bui Embcssador Bayard Feels Deeply
Grateful for the Good Will of
the English People.
LONDON, Eng., Dec 6.â Hon. Thomas
F. Bayard, the American Ernbassador,
has written a letter to the Daily Telegram
anent that journal's proposal to take up a
public subscription for the purpose of
purchasing bim a National Christmas
gift as a token of the esteem of the British
people. The letter, which is dated De
cember 5, says In part:
"Early this morning I, telegraphed you
not to proceed further with your kind and
generous proposal for a testimonial to me
from the people of this country in token
of their appreciation of my efforts to es
tablish between the two great English
speaking countries relations of harmony
and good will."
Mr. Bayard then proceeds to say that he
was touched and gratified by the proposal
and the Telegraph's eenerous eulogy of
him, but that a few hours reflection
showed him that, holding his present
office and invested with its discretion and
duties, he should scrupulously obey the
spirit of his country's law, which inhibits
any one holding an office of trust or
profit under the American Government
from accepting "without the consent of
Congress any present from any king,
prince or government."
He farther says: "While I live I shall
not cease to thank the people of these
islands for the wholehearted, unstinted
welcome I have received at their hands
and the warm hospitalities that have been
showered on me and mine."
The Telegraph, in a leader, will to-mor
row announce the withdrawal of its prop
osition. It says there is no need to in
quire whether any high official authority
influenced Mr. Bayard to decline the pro
posed gift. The reception of the proposal
has shown how sincere is the good will of
the English nation toward him.

FOR REFORM OF
THE CURRENCY
There Is a Difference of
Opinion Among Those
Interested.
Claims That a Ccmmission Can

It Is a Task of Months, and Not Days,
to Prepare the Plans to Pre
sent to Congress.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 6.â The
movement of the business interests of the
country toward National currency reform
upon wholly non-partisan lines, which
has resulted in a call by the commercial
organizations of the Central West for a
convention in this city in January, prom
ises to become one of the notable things in
the history of the country. It is doubtful
whether any of the delegates to the con
ference last week have any idea of tlie
breadth of the pan Hugh H. Hanna,
chairman of the executive committee, has
in mind for accomplishing this reform.
During the conference there developed a
sharp line of difference between those
favoring the adoption of a currency plan
by the convention, which is to meet on
January 12, and those who believe that
the convention should simply discuss the
various plans presented and refer the
whole matter to a commission. This dif
BRYAN'S BOOK ON THE FIRST BATTLE
LINCOLN, Nebr., Dec. 6.â lt was learned yesterday that the title of
William J. Bryan's book is to be "The First Battle." In the preface he states
his reasons for writing tne work in these words:
"The campaign of 1896 was a remarkable one, whether we measure it by
the magnitude of the issues involved or by the depth of interest oroused. I
have been led to undertake the present work by a desire felt by myself and
expressed by others to have the more important incidents of the campaign
put into permanent form for the convenience of those who have taken part in
the contest and for the use of those who shall hereafter desire to review the
struggle.
"T;.e amount of work done by the advocates of free coinage is beyond
cop.m utation, and the number of those who took an active part in the contest
too great for enumeration. These facts, together with the difficulty of
choosing between so many meritorious speeches, have compelled me to limit
the quotations to the addresses made and papers issued by persons standing
in an official or semi-official capacity, and to the principal speeches delivered
by myself, i bave added a brief history of the campaign, including a discus
sion of the election returns and the significance thereof. It has also been
thought best to narrate the part taken by me in the silver agitation prior to
the convention, and at the request of the publishers I have included a
biographical sketch, written by Mrs. Bryan."
It Is understood here that the publishers will issue the book in the early
part of January.
ference of opinion did not crop out until
the closing hour of the se-sion, and then
it was too late to go into the subject in
telligently. M. E. Inealls of Cincinnati
was the most forceful advocate of the idea
that the convention should indorse a plan.
He dd this upon the very reasonable
theory that Congress would pay more at
tention to the petition of a large represen
tation of business men than to the action
of a few men composing a commission,
even though the commission represented
the convention.
Mr. Hanna led that portion of the con
ference believing that a commission
should be appointeJ. Nothing, however,
is futther from tiis mind than that this
commission, after completing its work of
devising a currency plan, should go down
to Washington and beg a hearing before
committees and ask this member and that
member to favor the bill.
"I am convinced that we should have a
commission," said he in conversing with
a reporter for the United Associated
Presses to-day. "This is not a question
upon wi.ich a large convention can make
an intelligent decision in a day or in a
week. This is a matter that will require a
commission two or three monthsâpossi
bly six months â of continuous work and
thought. Every plan presented should be
carefully weighed, and out of all that
comes before the commission I believe it
will be able to evolve something that
every intelligent business man can heart
ily indorse. I think a long step in this
direction will be made if this convention
should select a commission composed of
the very greatest and best men we have in
the country.
"We could afford to pay well for the ser
vices of those who could not otherwise
afford to devote the necessary time to the
work. Then when the commission ha 3
finished its work the largest part of our
duty remains to be done in the thorough
organization and concentration of the
business of tne country behind the meas
ure.
"This is a matter of so much import
ance that we can afford to do this, great
as the undertaking is. Instead of sending
a committee to Washington to ask a Con
gressional comrrittee for a bearing we
should, when a bill that we can all in
dorse is evolved, ask our representative to
come home for consultation with his con
stituents. If all the members of Congress
with large business constituencies can be
thus thoroughly informed as to the de
sires of the men who were potential in
their election I do not believe there would
be any doubt about the enactment of the
measure into law. Ido not want to see it
made a bankers' convention or a bankers'
commission, thougli I want to see that
their interests as well as other business
interests are represented. WÂ«j want to
solve this problem for the whole people,
not for any particular class of people or
for any particular line of business."

Some Michigan Politicians Work Against
the General.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 6.â After a week
of the hardest work he has experienced
for two months Major McKinley enjoyed
a day of thorough rest. The sun was
bright, the sties clear and the tempera
turf agreeable. Major McKinley took a
drive with Colonel and Mrs. Myron T.
Herrick in the morning and a walk in the
afternoon. There were no callers of a po
litical character. This evening Major Mc-
Kinley was thoroughly rested and in the
brightest of spirits. There will be a good
many distinguished visitors at Canton
this week, though the number of Con
gressmen will not be as large as it has
been.
Michigan politicians who passed
through Canton to-day are authority for
the statement that General Alger will be
opposed in his own State and that Mayor
Piug:ee, ex-benalor Palmer aud others
may make a formal protest against his
appointment to a position in the Cabinet.
It #is also stated that influences in
Michigan that are unfriendly to General
Alger will seek to bave Senator Sherman,
whose opposition to bim is a matter of
history, oppose his confirmation if bis
name be sent to the Senate as a Cabinet
officer. There is no doubt of the fact that
while General Alger is strongly urged for
a Cabinet position, there is some opposi
tion to him, though the extent or import
ance of it has not developed.
TO PREPARE A. NEW BILL.
Oingley's Measure Will Sot Be Pushed
in Congress.
WASHINGTON, D. C Dec. 6.â A state
ment made by Hon. Nelson Dingley.
chairman of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, since his return from Canton,
where he went to confer with President
elect McKinley, confirms the prediction
made by The Call correspondent ten
days ago. Mr. Dingley says: "Frankly
speaking, I have no hope of the Senate
passing the bill. It is the same old Sen
ate. Yet I cannot but hope that good will
result from the agitation."
It was very plain, from other statements
made by the chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, that he had little faith
that the House of Representatives would
act favorably on the bill, evert if by a very
remote possibility the bill should pass the
Senate. And furthermore, despite state
ments of Eastern newspapers made re
cently concernine the attitude of Presi
dent Cleveland, he would veto the bill if
it should pass both houses of Congress.
As stated in these dispatches heretofore,
members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee dele.-ated one of their number to
talk with the President concerning the
Diugley bill. While the President did
not state in so many words that he would
veto the bill if it should be sent to him,
he expressed his disapproval of the
measure very plainly.
To sum up the whole situation, mem
bers of the House Committee realizing
that the bill would have a rocky road to
travel through the Senate, with a probable
veto should it pass, have determined not
to press the measure, but to get together
as soon as possible (during Jhis snort
session) and immediately begin to formu
late a bill so that it will bt all ready to
submit to the House when the Fifty-iifth
ConurÂ«ss meets in extraordinary suasion,
about the mutdle of March. The Ways
and Means Committee will be constituted
in the Fifty-fifth Congress practically as it
is now. The members are familiar with
the tariff schedules, and it is believed that
they could have the tariff bill framed by
the time that the extra session meets.
The Republicans, it will be remembered,
sharply criticized the Democrats for not
allowing fuiler hearings to manufacturers
when the Wilson bill was being framed,
so that it is believed that the Republican
Ways and Means Committee will now
accord lengthy and exnaustive hearings to
the manufacturers and others interested.
No: withstanding this it is the judgment
of Mr. Dingley that the uill will be ready
in time and that there will be liitie delay
in acting upon it in the House, but the
Senate, a more deliberative body, will
take its time, and it is expected that the
extra session will be a protracted one, and
may last until the fall of next year.
Statements made by Mr. Dinelev since his
talk with Major McKinley indicate that
the bill will be a moderate one, at the
same time being "amply protective."

was not a day of rest for Mark Hanna.
He was busy entertaining callers the
greater portion of the day. This forenoon
he took a drive with Senators Sherman

awaiting him. Among those who called
and with whom he had conferences were
Senators Burrows of Michigan, Aldrich

TO RESTRICT IMMIGRATION.
An Illiteracy Test It Urged by the
he a nut of Bo* ton.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 6.â Messrs.
Prescott F. Hall, the secretary, and John
F. Moore, a member of the executive com
mittee, of the Immigration Restriction
League of Boston, are in the city to urge
the passage throuzh the Senate of the
Lodge-Corliss bill to restrict immigration
by an educational test. The committee's
last report, which shows the effect of im
migration upon the United States and the
reasons for further restriction have been
printed and a copy will be furnished to
each Senator and Representative. Speak
ing with a United Associated Presses re
porter Mr, Hall said:
''The Lodge-Corliss bill provides that all
immigrants who are more than 14 years of
age must be able to read and write some
language, but it also provides that aged
parents and grandparents of admissible
immigrants may accompany or be sent
for by such immigrants. *
"The theory of the reading and writing
lest is not that an illiterate person may
not be moral and industrious in particu
lar cases, but that in general illiterates
are least desirable for other reasons. Sta
tistics show that the countries sending us
the- most illiterates send also the largest
number of those ignorant of any occupa

CHOPPING DOWN THE GATES.
Kentuckians Destroy Considerable Valuable
Property in Order to Cease
Paying Tolls.
HARRODSBURG, Ky., Dec. 6 âA mob
of between forty and sixty men, armed
with shotguns and axes, rode through
Mercer last night and chopped down six
toil-gates. Tlie gatekeepers were warned
not to repair the gates orcoilect any more
toll under penalty of being burned out.
The mob pÂ»ssed through this city at 2
o'clock this morning en route from Macks
ville for Harrodsburg, and they destroyed
every gate in the line of march. At Salt
River, one mile from here, Dave Barnett,
a gatekeeper, was made to chop down his
own gate, and was told to notify the turn
pike directors that if the gate was repaired
and money collected the raiders would not
only burn the tollhouse, but the private
property of the board of directors. These
gentlemen have ordered the gates repaired
and toll will be collected by an armed
force if necessary. Tj c tame warning was
given at some ol the other gates.
Over three hundred toll-gates have been
burned or chopped down since the turn
pike war began in Washington County
three mouths ago, and as yet only five
arrests have been made. No convictions
resulted from these. The gates destroyed
represent 1500 miles of turnpike, val
ued ai $4,000,000 and the State and county
authorises have furnished no protection
whatever.

One Spanish Leader Hikes a Glowing
Report of His Brutal Capture of
a Hospital
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 6.â Three days
have now elapsed since nny news was
received from Captain-General Weyler.
It is not known in what part of the
province of Pinar del Rio he is or what he
is doing toward carrying out the plan of
campaign on which the loyalists have
built hopes, but which thu3 far have
resulted in no signal success. Heavy rains
have been prevailing lately, and it is
probable that the condition of the country
has put a temporary check on the opera
tions of the Spanish forces.
Officials here have stated that there is
nothing surprising in no dispatches being
received from General Weyler, as he is a
man ot action rather than of words, and is
wailing to meet the rebels before he
devotes time to the writing of dispatches.
General Melguizo reports that his com
mand surprised a rebel hospital in the
Valle Hills, province of Pinar del Rio.
Six insurgents, whether wounded or not
is not stated, were killed, and the dwell
ings and all camp paraphernalia were de
stroyed.
The first installment of the new re-en
forcements, numbering 2500 men, arrived
here to-day.

bad augmented considerably.
Under date of November 21, Dr. H. S.
Caniinero, inspector et Santiago de Cuba,
reported that the smalipox epidemic
which had ra^ed for several months was
at an end. Yellow fever, however, still
prevailed, and he was sure that it would
increase, inasmuch as a contingent of 20,

NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 6. -A special
cable to the Herald from Constantinople
says: The Ikkadam says: The news that

lated a complaint against the Imperial
Government is devoid of foundation. The
United States, desiring a maintenance of
amicable relations and with the obiÂ°ct of
dissipating all doubts, has officially de
nied the report in question.
Dr. Kimbail's a-sertion that the Na
tional flag had been torn down in the
Haskeuy quarter of Constantinople â a
statement which aroused a great demon
stration of indignation â is not approved.
Such a charge was made, but alter most
minute inquiries the missionaries on the
spot denied it.

PARIS. France, Dec. 6.â A heavy gale

have been lost, but tbere is no report of
any loss of life. The breakwater at Point
Edgrave, Bordeaux, has been broken by
the heavy seas pounding against it, and
the low-lying country thereabouts is sub

SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec. G.â Charles
Hobbs knows much more about mountain
Ijons than he did three days ago. So does
Gharles Gritlin, a young man of the same
age. . The two boys, accompanied by Mrs.
ilobbs,- Charles' mother, were on their
v.-ayon hc-rseback to ths Griffin ranch in
Green "Valley, forty miles east of this city,
on.Friday. They had reached a lonely
part of the road in a little canyon branch
ing -in two ways, leaving the road ahead of
t^ :n ' concealed by a sharp turn in the
cÂ£;. ;ori, when the two leading horse?, lid
(â¢ by Hobbs and Griffin, snorted and
t^d Co whirl. Both the young men are
cxper,t*hors>emen and they kept their seats
nnd-foroed the horses ahead. Keeping a
sharp lookout under the shadowy brush
young iJobbs rode ahead, meantime draw
ing his revolver.
*S.\iddenly, without warning, a big moun
tain lion leaped out toward him, not utter
iriga roar until it was in the air. It
# Â° ââ  landed 'on the horse's foreshoulder and
used its claw instantly to rip and tear at
"Â« Â°, Hobbs| long leather boot. Fortunately the
leather -was thick and resisted the claws
irntll tlia rearing of the horse dislodged
the lion. Hobbs fired at about the same
time, but his shot missed.
.There was a great commotion among
the horses and their riders. Mrs. Hobbs,
though a brave woman, shrieked when
she saw her son's danger and was unable
to control her horse, which reared and
turned, trying to run away. Yours
Griffin ratitoassisf her, knowing Hobb
couiii handle the big cat with his gun.
rr.n the evening shadows were so deep
that Hobbs could not see plainly enough
to. get a f:\tal shot, especially as his horse
was going through such, acrobatics.
Leaving Mrs. Hobbs safely in the road,
Griffin hurried forward to assist his com
panion. Together ti.ey started into the
clttmpof bushes where the great yellow
C-it was skulking. They saw its form in
distinctly, and could have killed it, but
Giitiin proposed that they capture it
alive.
"How," asked Hobbt.
"Well," replied Griffin, "I will go back
a yard or two, and you ride up and draw
the'biir cuss out at you. When he jumps
out away from those bushes 1 will lasso
him with my lariat."
The programme was instantly carried
out, before the brute had a chance to re
treat. Gnllin dropped back, getting his
rial in readiness while Uobbs, getting
'â '..e.word, dashed toward the lion like an
JijPeche. Hi 3 taciics had the desired
effect. The lion, with a scream ot" rage,
leaped out of the thicket, and in another
bound was at the horse's nostrils. Griffin,
with tbe expertness of a trained horse
man, darted forward on bis horse and let
/ the-lariat fly. It circled around the body
of the lion and drew taut, while, with a
characteristic cowboy yell, Griffin sent
the spurs home and dashed past Hobbs
draEg'ne the lion over and over in the
dust, while it spit, clawed and screeched.
Hobbs rode back and got his mother,
aiTd together they followed Griffin, wno
went at a rapid s.ait so as to keep the
Jariat taut. Whenever the lion showed
signs of attacking Griffi:i or iiis horse
Hobbs would run up and tease it, distract
ing its attention from the man in front, i
In this fashion the big lioii was taken to
the Griffin house. The boys called to one
of the men inside to get a lariat, which
was dene, and five minutes later the
tawny captive was crowling and grumb
iing inside a heavy box. He has not been
measured, as no one cares to get his hands
too cio<e to the razor-like claws, but tbe
. mountain people say he is the biggest one
seen in tbÂ«Â»S9 parts for years and they ac
count for his ferocity on the theory that
his mate bad been killed.
MILFORD-LOS ANGELES LINE.
Work May Soon Be Commenced on thi
Connecting Railway to Salt
Lake.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 6.â The talk
of the Utah and Los Angeles railroad pro
ject has been revived in consequence of
some recent litigation, which hp.s for its
object the segregation of that portion ot
fthe Un on Pacific Railroad known as the
Oregon Short i.me, between Salt Lake City
and. Milford, Nev., and its formation into
an independent road. If this can be ac
complished, it is claimed that the build
ing of the Fait Lake rond is but the matter
of a short time.
The Union Pacific system is now under
the control of a receiver, and until this ob
stacle is removed, no improvements can
be made. Ju?t as soon as it car. be formed
into an independent line, there will ba no
Ibarrier to prevent it from extending its
. By "a decree of tho Federal Court at Salt
** "Lake City the defendant, Oregon Short
Line and Utah Northern Railway Com
pany, is required to pay to the clerK of
the Federal Court the amount of $2,417,
-616 otherwise the lines embraced in tho
system will be sold at public auction to
the highest bidder for cash after four
week's' pullicntion of the. notice of sale.
It is claimed that the bondholders of the
rond have brought about this condition of
affairs and expect to buy the road them
selves It is further slated that these
same individuals have already secured the
right of way for a considerable distance
tfetween Miiford and Los Angeles, which
is about 400 miles.
A* company has been organized for a
â¢year past called the Utah and California
Railway Company, waiting to build from
Milfuru to Los Angeles as soon as it can
pet this piece of road cut loo. u e from the
Union Pacific system. The new company

LOS ANGELES, Cal , Dec. 6.-Leweilyn
Bixby, a capitalist, was found dead at bis
residence on North Broadway last even
ing. His family missed him and sent in
quiries about the city and to Lone Beach,
but failed to rind any trace of him.
Finally one of the children happened to
go to his room and saw him lying on the
floor. He had been dead for an hour or
more, having evidently come into tlw:
house unknown to the family and gone to
the room. Heart disease is supposed to
have been the cause of death.
Bixby was one of the oldest settlers in
this section and owned hundreds of thou
sands of acres of land. With his brother
Jotham, he owned Alamitos. Bixby and
other ranches embracing that country
lying between Alamitos Bay on the east
and Wilmington on the west, extending
for miles toward this city. He was at one
time associated with Flint in business and
investments. Bixby was a director in one
of the local banks and had recently en
gaged in the enterprise of starting a beet
sugar factory at Alamitos.
SANTA CRUZ HOTEL CHANGES.
Pacific Ocean and Sea Beach Houses
Soon to Reopen Under a New
Management.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., J)ec. 6.â lt is ex
pected that the Paritic Ocean House will
be reopened to-morrow or Tuesday. There
have been several propositions talked of,
but the F. A. llihn Company and the City
Bank, which own the property, will not
permit the place to long remain unoccu
pied. F. A. Hihn, through these two
organizations, controls also the Sea Beach
Hotel, the Hobron House and the Eastern
Hotel in this city, the latter two being
now ia operation, and the Hotel Capitola
and the Lewis House of Capitola, and the
Hotel de Robles at Paso Kobles Springs in
Monterey County. There is evidence of
the formation ot a management to con
duct all these properties the coming sea
son, to be personally directed by one man,
a thorough hotel-keeper.
Colonel Peakes of Stockton has been
here since Thursday, and the presence
here last week of John T. Sullivan, for
merly keeper of t lie Sea Beach Hotel, was
considered sieniticant in connection with
the recent visit o' Frank E. Webb, repre
senting Boston anÃ San Francisco capital
that sought investment in the Sea Bench
and Pacific Ocean houses. In ft.ct, there
has been talk of hotel changes for several
weeks, the outcome of which may be pre
dicted -only by the owners.
In the meantime plans are being per
fected for the reconstruction of the Hotal
ing block into a first class modern hotel.
The building is practically new, having
been erected just after the big fire of
April, 1594. and its location is advan
tageous. Whatever may De done by the
owners or management of the other hotels,
the Hotaling will be a competitor for the
patronage of the traveling public. The
actual work of reconstruction will begin
on January 1, under the snpervision of E.
Farrell, agent for Mr. Hotaling.
REDWOOD CITY ACCIDENT.
Ex-Sheriff Kinne Fall* from a What
Into a Creeh.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Dec. 6. â An
amusing, though rather serious, accident
occurred here yesterday evening. W. H.
Kiune, one of the pioneers of this county,
who for many years held the office of
Sheriff, and whose reputation as a crimi
nal-hunter is State- wide, is now the pro
prietor of the Capital Hotel. The hostelry
is situated on the bank of the creek which
runs through the center of the town, there
being room lor a roadway only between
tbe hotel and the creek.
While contemplating a"hd admiring the
grandeur of his caravansary Mr. Kinne
unwittingly stepped backward and off the
wharf, landing on his back in the soft mud
of the creek. Had ho fallen on bis head
he would undoubtedly have smothered
before assistance could reach him. Mr.
Kiane. is a large man, weighing about 250
pounds, and as the mud was three feet
deep he was unable to help himself. A
sorry-looking specimen he was with his
feet and arms waving in the air. His
cries scon gathered a sympathetic crowd,
which threw him a rope and extricated
him from his embarrassing predicament.
He has experienced no evil results from
his mishap. It was in this same creek that
Sheriff Green was drowned many years
ago.

but for the interference of Rodriguez's
friend.

his wounds dressed, but revised to give the
name of his assailant or to prosecuie him.

first, but the wound in the shoulder is caus
ing considerable trouble, and may cause
death. Sheriff Lyndon investigated the
case and succeeded in fastening the cut
ting upon Miranda, and Rodriguez then
charged him witn assault to murder.

A Dinner Vaudeville to Open a Season
of Gayety in Her Naw York
Mansion.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. Gâ A special to a
morning paper from New York says: Mr.
and Mrs. Herman Oeirichs will to-morrow
nieht give a notable entertainment â a
dinner vaudeville. This is taken as an
indication, after having since her mar
riage, several years ago, played an incon
spicuous part in society, that Mrs. Oei
richs is now ambitious to shine as a
leader.
The Oeirichs have expended more than
$200,000 upon alterations and decorations
on their leasod bouse at the northwest
corner of Fifth avenue and Fifty-seventh
street, which is believed to mean that Mrs.
Oeirichs proposes to make her home the
scene of as much gay ety as possible this
winter. It was occupied formerly
by Mrs. Paran-Stevens and her daugh
ters, Mri. Paget, and shares the
four corners of Fifth avenue, In that

the splendid C. P. Huntington and Cor
nelius Vanderbilt establishments directly
opposite and the pre'.ty house which is to
be the future home of Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Payne Whitney (nee Yanderbih) on the
other corner.
The fact that her sister, Miss Virginia
Fair, is one of the halt dozen greatest
heiresses in town as well as a bright,
pretty and attractive girl, should assist
Mrs. Oeirichs in carryinz out her purpose.

BALTIMORE, Mb., Dse. 6.â CDnsnl-
General Murguiendo of Uruguay to-night
affirmed the statement made through the
United Associated Presses last Friday to
the effect tbat the reported revolution in
Uruguay was of little account. The Con
sul-General was at that time in receipt of
a cablegram from Montevideo, the Uru
guayan capital, saying the revolt was un
important. A subsequent publication,
which purported to represent a serious
condition of affairs in Uruguay, caused
him to send the following cablegram to
the Minister of Foreign Affairs at Monte
video:
Merchants ask for Information as to the state
of the revolution in Uruguay.
To this inquiry the Uruenayan Consul-
General has received the following reply :

Blockade.
SEATTLE, Wash.. Dec 6.-The floods
and storms prevailing in the Pacific
Northwest for a month past have had a
very disastrous effect upon commerce in
this section. Owing to the crippled con
dition of the railroads the lumber busi
ness, the chief industry ol Washington, is
practically paralyzed. Coastwise and for
eign trade has suffered, but nothing in
comparison witn interstate and Eastern
shipments. What is worse, relief does
not appear to oe near at hand. At no
time within a month could consignments
over either transcontinental line to the
East be made with any certainty of safe
delivery. Washouts on either railroad
have extended from the coast through
Washington and Montana to the snow
blocked prairies of the Dakotas.
The depressing effect has been far-reach
ing, for in the lumber business in this
State alone there are directly and indi
rectly about 20.C00 men engaged. Nearly
all the big business houses, wholesale and
retail, of this city are running low in the
matter of general stocks.
Many special shipments of holiday
goods are blocked on the through lines
between the coast and St. Paul, with the
result that merchants are complaining,
even though such an unfortunate state of
affairs has been brought about through
the displeasure of the elements. Con
necting lines are also feeling the stress of
blocked traffic, while the loss in receipts
to the main carriers has been enormous.
Meanwhile the prices of beef and
mutton have ascended. These supplies
Western Washington obtains from the
broad prairies east ot the Cascades, and
transportation of live-stock from that
section hither has been attended by even
greater perils, vexations and delays than
with dead freight. Stock-raisers have by
reason of the unusual fall of snow on the
other side been forced to feed their cattle
this winter, and this has also contributed
towards the general advance in prices.
While the involved roads are making
neroic efforts to get control of their prop
erty again, they are not receiving much
encouragement by way of prospects for
better weather. The rainfall continues
with aggravating regularity. Reports
from the Cascades are most discouraging.
All mountain ptreams are as bigh as three
weeks ago, and large rivers emptying into
the Sound are rising, and in some cases
beyond their batiks.
SIX-DAY BICYCLE RACE.
Cracks From Abroad and at Home En.'er
the Great International Contest at
Mtdison-Square Garden.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. Câ The six
day bicycle race at Madison-square Garden
was started shortly after midnight to
night in th/\ presence of a big crowd of
spectators. Much interest is taken in the
event, owing to the international charac
ter lent by the London and French riders,
of whom Tom Linton, the world's cham
pion, Charley Chappie, the English long
distance crack, and Jules Dubois of Paris-
Bordeaux race fame, are the stars. The
foreigners all looked to be in fine condi
tion, and expressed a great deal of confi
dence that tinal honors would go their
way. But the American contingent were
equally hopÂ°ful of victory, and Albert
Shock, winner of the last six-days' race in
the garden, and Charley Ash inger, carried
the hopes of the bomo contingent. The
gardens were handsomely decorated and
from 8 o'clock until midnight the band
kept the waiting crowd In humor until
the men were sent off. The track, which
is ten laps to the mile, was fairly well
banked, but the surface looked rather
alippery, while the corner* were scarcely
hi. h enough.
FÂ»ui as sprinting will not be a feature of
the week the starters were all fairly well
satisried, although PJummer, the foreign
er's manager, thought that the banking
ought to have been better.
Just at midnight Starter A. A. Zimmer
man got the riders under control as fol
lows: Albert Shock, New York; Frank
Waller, Germany; Tom Linton, Wales;
William Lnmsden, Scotland; Charles

MACKAY RETURNING HOME.
Comes With a Trainload of Thoroughbred
Horses for Ranch o del
Paso.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 6. â John W.
Mackay, the California millionaire, regis
tored at the Wellington to-day. He was
on his way from Lexington to fcis Rancho
del Paso, near Sacramento, with the string
of thirty-four thoronehbred horses which
he purchased at the combination sale
held at Lexington last week.
Among them were the stallion Orna
ment, for which he. paid $26,000, and Can
dlemas, the DrotheV of St. Blaise, which
cost him $15,000. The string altogether
represented over $10),000. They were con
veyed in a special train of six burton cars.
Mr. Mackay, with a party of friends,
traveled in a special car. In each of the
cars conveying the horses was an attend
ant. The train left at 5:50 over the Bur
lington, and will then travel over the Cen
tral and Union Pac fie roads.
Mr. Mackuy said the Lexington sale
was a eood one, the prices being better
than at any sale held for a long time, lie
was of the opinion it presaged an advance
in the prices of thoroughbreds.
Mr. Mackay believed the business out
look was decidedly promising, and that a
steady improvement was to be expected
from now on.
He said the result of the election ex
emplified the truth of the statement made
by John Stuart Mill, the English
economist, that "the American people
had the unfortunate habit of going off at
times on some wild financial heresy, but
bad the good fortune to get right at ihe
critical moment."
SPORTS IN A FREE FIGHT.

ing a Fight on an Alleged
Foul.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec. 6.-Nettled
by a rank decision given by a man named
Cameron of Chicago, who refereed a pr'7.?
light at Hail's Corner, ten miles souih of
this city last night, a crowd of 200 Mil
waukee and Chicago sports engaged in a
free fight in which several were so severely
hurt that they will not be well lor a week.
The right was between Harry Fails of
this city and Teddy Murphy of Chicago,
and was for a purse of $300. It was to be
a twenty-round match. Fails had the
best of the fight, which had proceeded as
far as the seventh round. In this round
Murphy made a swing at Fails and, ac
cording to Cameron, the referee, fouled
him. Cameron at once awarded the fight
to Fails.
The crowd howled indignantly at the
decision and rome one jumped over the
ropes and attacked the referee. It was
only a moment before the whole crowd
was in a frpe light and many of the con
testants were knocked out.
The stallholder escaped to a carriage
and was on his way to this city, when
some of the crowd stopped the carriage,
shoved revolvers into the faces of the
occupants and told them that they wanted
Cameron. Wnen they learned that Came
ron was not in the rig they allowed it to
proceed. The money Till be paid to Fails.

LAND RECLAIMERS
ENTITLED TO PAY
Judge Minor Decides the
Stanislaus County
Test Case.
Treasurers Must Cash Warrants
Presented With Proof of
Labor.
Vast Sums Involved in the Actioa
Just Brought to a Close at

MODESTO, Cal., Dec. 6.â The reclama
tion district case has been decided by the
Superior Court of Stanislaus County, de
claring the claims of reclaimers legal and
that Mie County Treasurer should recog
nize and pay them.
About a year ago many reclamation dis
tricts were iormed throughout the State.
Men having swamp and overflow land
could, by expending a certain amount of
work to reclaim it, present claims to tue
Board of Supervisors with proof of labor,
and receive pay frorr. the county for the
work, the land to remain the property of
the reclaimer. Claims wers presented in
this county nearly a year ago to County
Treasurer W. A. Downer, but he did not
consider the demands legal, and refused
to cash the warrants.
A test case was begun under the title of
J. M. Canty et al. vs. W. A. Downer,
Treasurer of Stanislaus County. The suit
involved many thousands of dollars ia
this county alone, and Boards of Super
visors of other counties withheld action
pending a decision in this case. Now
Superior Judge ~\V. O. Minor declares the
claims legal and authorizes the Treasurer
to pay the warrants.

people to rush forward, and, oveiÂ»in the
face of temporary commercial setbacks, to
reach out and compel fortune to smile |
BUSINESS BLOCKS THAT ADD TO SAN DIEGO'S ATTRACTIVENESS.
npon them, as it were, by their constant I
energy and elasticity of disposition, which
setbacks have in a large measure dis
couraged the people of other communities j
and caused business stagnation whenever 1
obstacles of moment have seemed to stand I
in their pathway. The people of San j
Diego are proud of their past record and j
achievements, and have abundant faith in !
the future of their city and county because j
of the .superior resources of this section 1
and of the large promise there is of tre- j
mendous agricultural, horticultural, com- j
mercial and mining development in the i
near future. This development is by no j
means merely a promise. In all of the
avenues of industry mentioned, as well as
along manufacturing lines, San Diego has
accomplished a great deal in the way of j
handsomely realizing what, a few years !
ago, were regarded by conservative minds
as mere creams.
One of the surest signs of prosperity, both i
present and prospective, of any com- i
m unity, is the extent of its building orera- i
tions. Activity in building affairs denotes !
a necessity for residences and business }
places which is the outcome of a leal j
demand. During 1895 and 1896 the value'
of new buildings erected in the city has j
been unprecedented since the boom of j
nearly ten years ago. This is the more 1
remarkable becau?e the increase in build- !
ins has occurred right in the face of severe j
financial depression throughout the \
Nation, when capital baa been wary and i
money exceptionally scarce. During 1895
the value of new buildings erected v.ithin
the city limits was about $400,000. During
the present year (1896) the value of new
bnildines is over half a million of dollars.
The character of this building movement
has been the most substantial. It has in
cluded some of the most handsome of solid
business and residence structures to be
found in Southern California. The in
vestors in these properties have heen
among the most level-headed business
men from all parts of the country. One of
the heaviest builders is U. S. Grant Jr.,
who now has no less than three of tne im
portant business blocks in the cit3\ but
also owns, in addition to these, a large
residence and a ranch in the Sweetwater
Valley.
About the first of the year the largest
manufacturing enterprise in the county
will begin operations. It is the San Die?o
Brewery, with a capacity of 150,000 barrels
of beer annually. The brick buildings of
this establishment are just being com
pleted under the direction of experienced
brewers, who intend to cater to the trade
of Central America, Mexico and interior
'.points. Space, however, is insufficient to
enumerate in detail, the many handsome
building blocks and residences that liave
just been added to the city.
In the way of public improvements dur
ing the year have been the opening of two
new electric streetcar lines and the build
ing of a lengthy extension of one of these
lines is now in progress. Many miles of
streets have been graded ana furnished
with cement sidewalks. The increased
street railway service has brought large
sections of excellent residence property
into close communication with the center
of the city.
A matter of importance to JSan Diego is
the beginning of the fortification of its
magnificent harbor by the National Gov
ernment. This harbor, which Is twelvb
miles long, can receive and Host the
navies of the world in its land-locked em
brace. It is to be defended by eleven
guns of the first class, and bids have jut
been advertised for by the Engineer De
partment, of the army for the construction
of one of the big gun batteries at the en
trance of the harDor.
This is a matter of significance to the
City, as the erection of Die guns means
the establishment here of a very consider
able artillery garrison. General Nelson
A. Miles, in his last annual report to the
Government, recommends the expendi
ture during the coming year of ' $600,000
upon fortifications. The National Gov
ernment already owns 1400 acres included
in the commanding peninsula of Point
Loma, on which Is already established a
large quarantine station and foundations
for a water battery, on which $G5,000 has
already been expended; in addition to
the-e improvements the Government is
spending $50,000 annually extending a
jetty in'.o the ocean at the harbor mouth
for the purpose of deepening the ship
channel over the bar, although the depth
of water there is already sufficient to
float the largest of ships.
Water is king in Southern California.
This county is royally provided with an
abundance of the precious fluid and the
development of this resource already
achieved is enormous. There are tlirue
irrigation systems at present established ;
that of the San Diego F;ume Company,
hnnging water from the Cuyamaca
Mountains fifty-three miles distant from
the city, furnishes not only a municipal
supply, but also 'irrigates" thousands of
acres at El Cajon, La Mesa, Lemon Grove
and at other points along the line.
Twenty to thirty thousand acres of the
best fruit land in the Stale are under this
system. In addition to this the water of i
the San Diego River furnishes an auxil- I
iarv supply of water for city purpose*.
The famous system of the San Diego
Laud aud Town Company has its 7,00j,0Q9 t 
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1896.
000 gallon reservoir in Sweetwater Valley.
This supply irrigates thousands of acres
in Sweetwater Valley, National City,
Chula Vista aud vicinity, where lemons
and oranges are raised in abundance on
ranches that are as level as barn floors.
One of these lemon ranches contains
nearly 1000 acres in a single tract, the
largest lemon orchard in the world.
At Escondido, a few miies back of
Oceanside, an irrigation system costing
about $400,000 has just been completed
which waters about 12,000 handsome
acres. The completion of this system Has
brought in many new settlers to that
fruitful valley, and ttie increase in the
value of its products is remarkable.
Daring the present season Escondido's
output of raisins alon. was twenty-five
carloads.
In June last the Southern California
Mountain Water Company be^an the con-
I struction of the largest and most compre
hensive irrigation system in the county.
The entire cost of this system will be up
ward of $3,000,000. The city of San Diego
is vitally interested in this system, as it
has voted bonds to t:.e extent of $1,000,000
and contracted with this company for a
water supply of 1000 inches of water per
petually, and for a pipe-line and distribut
ing system to and within the city limits.
Under the contract the purpose is to give
the city an independent water system
from fountain head to kitchen faucet, and
upon the completion of this vast project
many predict increased prosperity for the
whole "county as well as for the city, for
the irrigating part of this large undertak
ing will insure the development of 60,000
acres of ranch land.
The recent decision of tbe United
States Supreme Court sustaining the
Wright irri ation law will have an in
tense stimulating effect toward the speedy
settlement of San Diego fruit lands. Un
der this decision the affairs of the Linda
Vista irrigation district, on the northern
edge of the city, will progress and it is
beiieved that the 44,000 acres embraced in
this district will be provided with water in
the near future." This land is frostless
and is regarded as tbe star lemon, tract of
California. The Jamacha district with
22,000 acres; the Fallbrook district with
ll.OuO acres in addition to the E.icondido
district already mentioned, all come un
der the beneficial influence of this deci
sion which promises to work so much
good toward the settlement and useful
ness of these acres. Under these districts
is a total of 89,000 acres, while under the
irrigation enterprises outside of the dis
tricts are overl&O.OOO acres additional, mak
ing a grand total of nearly 200,000 acres of
the bestfruit lands in the State, a large
part of which acreage is absolutely frost
less. The irr^ation districts now organ
ized which are yet without water works
have secured reservoir sites and water
rights which are ready for development.
Two lines of, steamers already have a
termiuus at tins port. One line operates
steamers between here and San Francisco,
calling at coast ports; the second line is
between this city and Ensenada, connect
ing with steamers for the Lower Cali
fornia and Gulf ports. During the year,
representatives of the Japanese Govern
ment and of the largest steamship com
pany of Japan have inspected this harbor
with much care with the purpose of
arranging to make it the terminus of a
trans-Pacific line. Negotiations are in
progress for the definite establishment of
this line, and the steamers are being built
in England. The operation of this line
promises much good for Southern Cali
fornia, commercially, and is a part of a
.grand project of the Japanese Govern
ment to establish a colony in Mexico for
the purpose of growine cotton, mining
I iron ore and securing other raw materials
needed in Japan for the encouragement of
manufacturing industries. These pro
ducts will help swell the freight of the
I steamers, 4000 tons of which freight are to
j be furnished monthly by Southern Cali-
I fornia producers. From Ban Diego, as a
I base of operations, it is proposed to
| operate these Japanese steamers to the
' principal ports on the west coast of
i Mexico.
While the building of the Nicaragua
I canal under Government auspices ia not
| yet absolutely assured, all signs point to
the speedy consummation of that much
desired aid to commerce. Throughout
California the belief prevails that the
canal is sure to be realized in the near
future. Its completion will mean the en
hancing of California property values by
â  hundreds of millions of dollars, and fore
| most among me ports to be benefited by
] the canal is that of San Diego. The canal
i would at once make this port the great
"hipping and distributing center for a
vast territory; California fruits can
then be shipped to New York to
arrive within a fortnight and at
freight rates that will enable this
section to command the home citrus fruit
market and drive foreign competition
j from our shores. Prospectively Sun
Diego, with its superb harbor, is the door
way of commercial possibilities within
easy reach of realizatioa in the no distant
future.
Volumes could be written of the advan
tages of the climate here. It ia acknowl
edged to possess the best all-the-year
round climate on earth. Thousands of
invalids who have regained health here
prove the helpfulness of these climatic
conditions. The county offers comfoit
table livine-places from 200 feet below
sea level to 7000 feet altitude, while the
average annual rainfall in the city is only
eleven inchc. In the mountains it is
always heavy and abundant. Delightful
temperature prevails in summer as well a<?
in winter and farming operations are car
ried on actively twelve months in the
year.
The city of 20,000 people has one of the
best equipped and conducted school sys
tems in the Nation. The social side of
lite here is delightful and like that to be
found in the old established cities of the
East. Churches of nearly all denomina
tions, a large public liDrary, a Chamber of
Commerce and other commercial organi
zations, excellent hotels, opera-houses and
all things necessary for a wide-awake, pro
gressive city are found in Sun Diego.
During 1893 nearly 1000 carloads 01 prod
uce were shipped out of the county and of
this about 500 carloads consisted of
oranges and lemons. Within a year or
two, according to estimates of conserva
tive railroad men, San Diego will ship
ICOO cars of citrus frui.s aunually, and the
increased product of the hundreds of t iiou
sands of trees coming into beaming prom
ises to increase the output lay thousands
of carloads and to encourage the building
to tnis point of a second transcontinental
railroad, to supplement the service now
rendered by the Santa Fe system.

A PLEA FOR HELPFULNESS
Rev. George Walk Speaks of
the Necessity for Alt ruism
in Life.
The Egotist Must Inevitably Become
a Pariah and Is Doomed to
Isolation-
Rev. George Edward Walk, M. A., of
Trinity Church preached yesterday from
the text 1 Cor., iii:9, "For we are laborers
together with God."
One of the grandest utterances of Ten
nyson is where the "immortal bird" puts
into the mouth of King Arthur these
"dying words":
More thlnsrs are wrought by prayer
i han 1 his worid dreams of. Wherefore let thy
voice
Hlse iike a fountain for me nUht and day.
For what are mÂ«n better than sheep or goats
That nourish a b.ind afe within the brain,
If knowing (i<rt, they lift uot hands of prayer
Both for themselves aud those who call them
friend?
For so the whole round earth Is every way
Bouud by gold chains about, the feet of no' I.
It is the old lesson that "no man liveth
unto himself."' It is not socialistic; it is
not even communistic, except as it ex
presses that best of all forms of pommun
lsm which our blessed Lord inculcaied in
his doctrine of the "brotherhood of man."
It simply means that we cannot live with
out the help of our fellowmen. It means
that no man has a right to >ay that "what
I bave is my own and I will do as
1 please with it." It means that the
Christianized world is a band of brothers â
who are banded together for the purpose
of mutual helpfulness. It means that the
man who will wrap himself in the gar
ment of his own selfishness inevitably
becomes a pariah â a "spotted man" â to
the "toilers and the moilers" in the eager
conflict of life. It means that the man
who is not willing to recognize
the benefits which have come to
him by reason of the interdepend
ence of man, and which may have
lifted him above the common wants of his
fellow mortals, and all the time cherishes
the spirit of selfishness and worldly pride,
will justly deserve the enforced isolation
and dread of tne work-a-day factors of
life which surround him.
"Man cannot live alone â try as he
might."

BEAU THE CROSS
ROUND THE WORLD
Theosophists Sowing the
Universal Brotherhood
of Man.
A Modern Movement of Broad
Purpose That Is Attracting
Wide Attention.
The Crusade Under Full Headway
in the East and Will Soon
Rsaca This City.
To-morrow evening at 8 o'clock the
theosophists will hold a meeting in their
hall in the Academy of Sciences, when
there will De something interesting told of
the great "Theosophical Crusade." Those
who go out to hear the addresses will be
told what the crusaders are doing and why
they are doing it. The officers of the
society here expect some important in
formation in to-day's mail, which rnll be
made public at the meeting.
News has just reached the theosophists
here that the crusaders have arrived safely
in Bombay and that they will be in San
Francisco about the end of March.
The crusade started from Boston last
summer and went first to London and
Liverpool. In Liverpool they accom
plished more than in any city ol their
journey. From the principal cities of
England they next visited Glasgow, Edin
burgh and Dublin. Next they pushed
their crusade to Hamburg, Berlin and
Vienna. In the city of Rai'ein. Austria,
they met Dr. Franz Hartman, who is one
of the greatest of theosophists and author
of books full of mystic lore. In all these
cities their efforts had gratifying results.
When they reached Athen3 tney found
themselves totally among strangers, there
were no theosophists to welcome them to
the classic city, but they rented a large
hall and immediately after the first meet
ing they organized a branch of 100 mem
bers.
From Athens they went to Malta and
thence to Alexandria and Cairo. The re
port of their success in Egypt has not yet
arrived, but is a part of the news expected
this week.
From India they will came to San Fran
cisco with their minds fresh stored with
wisdom gathered from the great manat
mas of the East.
The leader of the crusade is Mrs. K. A.
Tingley. Nextin prominence is E. T. Har
grove, who is president of the Theosoph
ical Society, not only the American branch
of it, but for Europe and Asia also. The
other crusaders are F. Pierce, Mr. and Mrs.
Claude Wright, H. T. Patterson, Rev. Wil
liam Williams and Mis. Alice Clether.
The purpose of the crusade is to rouse
public attention to the cardinal truths
taught by theosophy, first among which
is that all men are brothers. They do not
merely mean by this that all men should
treat each other with kindness, but they
insist that the brotherhood is & fact of
creation from which we cannot escape.
They lay claim to a broader teaching of
this principle than the churches incul
cate, because they say that is only a
brotherhood of members, while theirs
reacues to the whole of humanity regard
less of race or creed or color, of sinfulness
or righteousness.
The second essential of their teaching is
the necessity of the study of all religions
in oraer to find the unity which runs
through them all.
The third is the study of the mysterious
in man and surrounding nature.
The crusade is not for the purpose of
proselytizing. People may remain in
their churches as now â but Christians,
Jews, Moslems, Buddhists can all be
Theosophists. Tne Crusaders hope to
form a nucleus from which will spread a
recognition of tne Universal Brotherhood
of Humanity.

SWALLOWED MORPHINE.
Lizzie Kuiersoti, a Woman From Seattle,
Commits Suicide.
Lizzie Emerson, a handsome woman,
about 25 years of age, who occupied two
rooms at 17 Stockton street, swallowed a
dose of morphine Saturday night about 11
o'clock. She was not discovered till two
or three hours later, and then she was un
conscious.
She was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, and for several hours Drs. Bunnell,
O'Brien and Kearney endeavored by every
possible means to sava her life, but with
out success, and she died shortly before 1
o'clock yesterday afternoon.
The woman came here about three
months ago from Seattle. To friends she
stated that her husband had died about
two months previously, leaving her with
a little girl to support. As Bhe could find
no means of supporting herself and her
child in Seattle, Â»hÂ« decided to come here.
I She left her child with her parents, who
i live in Seattle. About a week ago she
told a friend that she was sick of her life
here and Intended going home.
It was noticed that for a few days back
she had seemed despondent, and it was
thought from expressions she used that
her husband was not dead, and that she
had deserted him and her child.
STORIES ABOUT GEORGE LAW.
I Exaggerated or Unfounded Reports
Which He Never Cared to Deny.
The late George Law belonged to a set of
New York men which had included in its
time such celebrities as Wright Sanford,
Fred May and George Pollock. Many of
them are still alive, but they play no con
j spicuous part in the life of the city as they
ilid ten or fifteen years ago. The man
i about town of the day has changed in a
number of particulars, and he is not of
ju^t the same athletic breed as formerly.
These earlier club men devoted more
time to heavier txercises, and whether or
not that was responsible for their size and
health, they certainly were a vigorous
looking lot. Some of the j ams told about
Mr. Law were true and some were not, but
they were nearly ali interesting. When a
man becomes a well - known hero for
stories any number of them 13 likely 10 be
come more or less identified with his
name, and many a stale fable is tempo
rarily revivified by its connection with the
personality of a well-known man who has
bpen selected by tacit consent as an appro
priate foundation for a story that needs
one.
Mr. Law suffered much in this -way.
Once he bought at Saratoga a lot of jew
elry for a number of sporting men who
had entertained him on his trip during
the two days he had spent at the springs.
The coat of the jewelry was under $4000,
an expenditure which Mr. Law could
readily afford, but the report was spread
that in a drunken debauch he had spent
$63,000 in this way, and hired a special
train to bring the crowd to New York. It
happened that Mr. Law x&s notdrinkiii"
at mat time and had not tasted alcohol
for eijrht months.
Early one morning a Sun reporter who
was driving through the country near
New York met Mr. Law driving a four-in
hand. Mr. Law was returning from a trip
of 600 miles, undertaken on a wager and
for fifteen hours he had been driving
almost tininterruptedly. Nevertheless a
paper printed that same morning an ac
count of a barroom brawl which had taken
place the night before in New York and
in which Mr. Law was made to appear as
the principal figure. In this way he was
falsely reported from time to time as
having indulged in a prolonged debauch.
He never even troubled himself to deny
these stories. He said he had never con
sidered it worth while to contradict them,
and he never even made the slightest ef
fort to deny the story telegraphed all over
the United States several years ago that
he had bankrupted h'mself playing faro.
He was absolutely indifferent to what the
newspapers said about him, although most
wealthy men are extremely sensitive un
der the kind of comment which Mr. Law's
alleged exploits always aroused.
After he was graduated from Columbia
College his father made him a driver on
the Eighth-avenue line of streetcars, and
his duty every day was to take a car down
from the stables to tbe Astor House and
back twice. One night after a cold rain
had chilled the young driver to the mar
row there occurred the only incident which
marred his good record in this branch of
the company's service. A friend oi his at
college jumped on the car and suggested
that a drink would be in order, consider
ing the weather and the time of night.
On Fifty-fifth street, midway between
Eighth and Ninth avenues, there was a
well-known sporting resort kept by an ex
boxing-master of Columbia. Mr. Law's
friend had proposed that he stop the car
while they run down the street, hurriedly
took a drink and returned to the car. But
Mr. Law preferred to follow his own ideas
iv the matter, and, giving the horses a sud
den yank, he turned them sharply toward
Ninth avenue and whipped them until, by
a quick effort, they lifted the car off the
tJack. Over the cobbles the strong horses
drew the car, to the amazement of
the conductor aud the passengers, and,
rattling down through the street, stopped
in front of the saloon. Mr. L.iw alighted
with his friend, and so did the rest of the
passengers. After they had. all taken a
drink at the driver's expense they re
turned, to the yehicle, and the car again
started the noisy progress over the stones.
When it was again on the rails and the
journey up Eighth avenue was resumed it
was rather the worse for wear.
During his days as a streetcar driver
Mr. Law most enjoyed his duties when in
charge of the ten-horse snow-plow. He
was a good whip, and was frequently seen
in the park on his four-in-hand.â New

REAL DOGS OF WAR
Uncle Sam Prop ises to Employ a Canine
Military Squad.
The War Department is seriously con
templating the training of dogs for use in
the army. Abroad they have been found
most valuable in campaigning, and many
German regiments already have canine
contingents. In fact, the animals are con
sidered an essential part of the fighting
organization, and are as carefully drilled
as the men. Before long all of the great
foreign military establishments will have
troops of four-legged soldiers, and it will I
not do for this country to lag behind.
Dogs, properly selected and educated, i
make the best sort of scouts and the most |
capable carriers of orders in the field. â¢
Tney are particularly useful for transmit- |
ting information, in conveying messages I
from advanced patrols and in maintain- |
ing communication between posts and j
pickets. Also t ey do excellent work in â¢
hunting up missing men. Their natural ;
qualities of docility, watchfulness, speed, :
acutenes3 of senses and affection for men j
render them conspicuously adaptable fur
military service. No regiment ought to !
be with out a dog squad.
Several breeds of dogs are found highly j
suitable for military purposes â notably J
poodles, shepherd dogs and bird dogi. 'â¢
The kind doe^ not matter so much as tne ]
quality of the breed, which must ba pure.
No mongrel makes a good war dog. It is
only in a well-bred dog that the valuable !
qualities above mentioned are developed!
in a superior degree. Poodles are the
cleverest of all dogs, and are firstraie
campaigners when young; but, unfortun
ately, they are apt to Jose interest in their
wo.-k after a certain age. The shepherd
dog probably comes next to the po die in
respect to intelligence. It is hardy and
alert, but very frequently it exhibits a
lack of affection for its master, and is
hard to train on that account.
All points considered, bird dogs make
the best war dogs. They unite the good
qualities of the poodle and shepherd dog, j
and are distinguished by a lively sense ot 1
duty and a devoted attachment to their j
masters. Under proper training they j
soon lose their Inclination for hunting,
and take up their military duties readily
and with interest. It is required of a war
dog that he shall pass through a general
preparatory course of training.
Choice may be made between two meth
ods â one severe and the oth%r gentle. The
animal may be kept by itself and half
starved, so as to compel it to surrender
unconditionally to the master's will. Or
the treatment may be wholly by kindness,
cultivating a mutual confidence between
dog and master and developing the
beast's intelligence. The latter method is
considered decidedly preferable. It iÂ»
more humane and produces better results.

has special expertness in such matters. He
selects assistants from among the cor
porals and privates and gives them les
sons in the art of training. It is his dntv
to buy the dogs, to distribute them amonV
the companies, to surpervise the breeding^
and rearing of pups and to see that the
animals nre properly cared for and fed.
The properly educated war dog must
carry messages with certainty, running
back from advanced patrols to detach
ments in the rear and then returning.
It is required to do this sort of work with
such efficiency as to maintain communi
cation between sentinels and stationary
detachments. The animal must be taught
to give notice to sentinels of the approach
of strangers. Some dogs will show an
aptitude for huntine up missing men, and
may be trained for that particular duty. â

Ihe Letter "11" and Its Victim-,.
Your story of the "h"-less barrister re
minds me (writes a correspondent) of
another of a -imilar nature which was
current at Oxford in my day. At the
celebrated election in 1865. at which Mr.
Gladstone lost his seat ior the university,
his opponent was Mr. Hardy. The prac
tice then (and. for aught 1 know to the
contrary, it may be so still at a contested
election) was for each elector to record his
vote by word of mouth before tellers for
each party sitting in the Convocation
House or" some other suitable place of
meeting. The late Professor Henry Smitu
was acting as teller for Mr. Gladstone,
when an uncontu country pardon entered,
and to the usual question for whom he
wished to record his vote replied in his
confusion, "I vote for Mr. Gladâ, I mean
for'Ardy." "I claim that vote," quietly
put in Professor Henry Smith. "No, no,"
protested the old clerevman, "I didn't
linish tue name." "You didn't even
begin the other," was the professor's dry
retort.
A story Is toid of an eminent legal prac
titioner who was afflicted with a similar
difficulty in pronouncing his aspirates,
many years aero. He had a particular
dislike to a late learned Lord Chancellor
who had published a book upon Hyir:;*

pste for P. aces in the Inter-
Republic Match.
Four clubs were represented at the
Bchuetzen Park ranges yesterday, and
ammunition was consumed until the
fading light rendered further scoring im
possible.
The California Schuetzen Club held its
regular monthly medal shoot, which,
however, was of more than ordinary in
terest, seeing that it closed the series for
the year and finally decided the cham
pionship in four different classes. Those
who are at all familiar with the personnel
of. the club will not be surprised to hear
that A. Strecker proved the winner of the
much-coveted medal awarded in the high
est class, his total scores for the twelve
.months being 3491. His strongest rival
was John Utschig, who, while recognized
as being among the best shots in the club,
has not the National reputation as a fine
rifle-shooter that Mr. Strecker *nas. The
latter has been East on several occasions,
where he acquitted himself with honor
alid showed to tÂ£e world that California
can produce the best riflemen as well as
the best in everything else.
Mr. Utscnie'B friends were apparently
keenly disappointed that he could not
take the laurels from Strecker's brow, and
Mr. Dtschig himself seemed to regret that
lie was not able to close up the gap be
tween himself and the champion. Mr.
Utschig, however, succeeded in securing
first placein the monthly contest, with a
total of 432 rings.
â¢ James Stantoii, a veteran member of
the club, made his first appearance after
an interval of illness and surprised his
comrades with some excellent pool-shoot
ing.

Mr. Utschig, who refused to give his score

INTER-REPUBLIC MATCH.
-.. 'A Lively Competition for Places In
the Coming Biz Event.
â¢*' There was a lively rattle of muskets and
â¢'. rifles at Captain Siebe's Shell Mound rifle
Â» range yesterday. Tne day was fine, but the
light upon the targets was a little too
. -bright for very good wore. There wascon
â¢' siderable practice by those who are prepar.
ing lor the final matches of the year.
â¢ The principal event was a general prac
. tice by the military marksmen of the First
Regiment, preparatory for a 100 - man
' match with the Hawaiian National Guard.
. The officers of these two bodies have for
some past been preparing for an inter
* republic match, mid thÂ» arrangements
have only recently been completed. E:ich
marksman is 10 shoot ten shots on his
own company's range, and the scores will
be exchanged at the earliest opportunity
by steamer. Each body will have it* rep
resentative on its adversary's range to see
that no advantage is gained. The match
. will probably take place on January 17,
although the date is'. not definitely de
â¢ ci^ed.
The understanding among the local
" marksmen was that the 100 National
Guardsmen making the best scores yester
day should compose the team. The next
best fifteen marksmen were to be held in
reserve as alternates in case any of those
' selected should not be present when the
match takes place.
The competition for places in the team
resulted in the annexed scores beine made,

FISTIC EVENTS TO COME,
The Occidental Athletic Club
Provides Various Con
tests.
i Jack Ward Will Meet Jimmy Anthony
and There Wi 1 Be Other
Game Battles.
Tliere is considera*ble interest in sport-
I ins circles over the prospective entertain-
I ment in the prize ring promised by'the
' Occidental Athletic Club at their hail on
j tbe 14th.
The programme promises fair play and
a thoroughly scientific entertainment,
without favoritism or other features to
mar trie evening.
Speakinp of the matter last night, Young
Mitchell Bnid: "We shall produce Jack
â \Vaid of Newark, N. J., who will meet
i Jimmy Anthony, bantam weight cham
pion of Australia. It will be a fine so.
and if the referee shoul i do any funny
business the club itself will take the mat
ter in hand."
Another fiirht arranged already is be
, tween Joe Gans and Charley Rochette for
I the litrhtweightchampionship of America.
; Rochette has lately been substituted in
the place of Hawkins, who failed to come
to time as provided in the terms of the
agreement. Rochette, who was formerly
a stereotyper, is rapidly coming to the
front as a successful man in the rin?.
Another feature promised is a contest
between local heavy-weights. The men
have not yet been selected, but they will
probably be the best in the field.
ABOUND THE DIAMOND.
Alerts Defeat the Hollitters â The
Swinns and Daily Keports Flay
a Tie Game.
The Alameda Alerts added another vic
tory to their already long string by de
featinc tbe Hollisters yesterday by a
score of 8 to 0.
A layge crowd of enthusiasts were pres
ent and were repaid by seeing as pretty
an exhibition of baseball as has ever been
seen in Central Park.
At the outset of the came the Alerts
objected to playing en the ground that
the Hollisters had players over the age
limit in their team. After some dis
cussion they withdrew their objection and
the game continued.
The Alerts showed wonderiul improve
ment in their playing, their fielding and
throwing to bases being of a high order.
Th<Â» support piven McKee was excellent.
Tbe score would have been different Had
Daubenbls received better support by the
Hollisters. He pitched a steady game,
striking out fourteen men.
In the rifth inning the Hollisters be
came badly rattled and allowed the Alerts
to scoie five runs, giving them a decided
lead.
Although McKee was batted freely, yet
the fielding of tbe Alerts prevented any
runs. The score was as follows:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1896.
REV. M. S. LEVY Delivering the Invocation at the Elks'
Memorial Services*
MARDI GRAS BALL
A PROPER FUNCTION
Society Leaders Readily Ap
prove of the Proposed
Masquerade.
Word to Be Passed Around
Advising Young Ladies to
Attend.
Ball tc Be Givm at the Mark Hopkins
Institute UncLr [the Auspices
of the Art Association.
The San Francisco Art Association did
not make any money to speak of by the
Mardi Gras ball of last season, but the
affair was such a triumphant social event
that another ball will be given this season.
Last Saturday the president of the An
Association conferred with quite a num
ber of leading ladies in society â the
mothers of promising "buds" â and
established favorites. Tuey gave the
proposition the stamp of their unqualified
approval. They suggested that the price of
a ticket for a gentleman should not be $10,
as it was last year, but ought to be re
duced to $5. The ladies entertain the idea
that many of the young gentlemen in the
social swim are not in position to easily
afford $10 for the pleasure ol the event,
and in order to encourage their attendance
the tickets should not cost more than half
that sum.
These ladies with whom the president
talked have had long experience in social
functions and their assured patronage is a
guarantee that society will attend the
Mardi Gras ball. Word will now be passed
along the line of youth, beauty and grace,
that a fetching fancy costume wili be the
proper thin,:, if a young lady's fancy runs
lhat way.
The proposition will be submitted to
the trustees of the Art Association at
their next meeting and some well-known
member of the board, perhaps Joseph D.
Grant, will be authorized to tske charge
of the affair.
Special care will be taken to exclude
from the masquerade all objectionable
characters. The ladies impressed on the
president's mind the necessity for special
vigilance in this respect.
The trustees fancy that if Mr. Grant and
the president are appointed to aÂ«sist the
ladies in directing the function no one will
get inside the Mark Hopkins Institute
who ought not to be there.
The trustees will assent readily to the
reduced price of admission recommended
by the Indies.

Hall.
Wilton Lackaye Reads Tenny
son's Beautiiul Poem,
" Memoriam."
E cquent Eulogy by Judge Tim and
an Excellent Musical
Programme.
Right loyally and lovingly the local
lodie of Elks paid tribute to their de
parted members yesterday afternoon.
Native Sods' Hall was beautifully deco
rated, the order's insignia, an elk's head,
beine a prominent feature, and lending a
pleasing and romantic touch to the more
conventional adornments. Two stuffed
elks occupied positions on the stape and
wreaths of evergreen denoted the sad pur
port of the occasion.
The programme prepared by the lodge
was very fine. San Francisco's choicest
musical talent had been procured for the
occasion. It. Fletcher Tiiton presided at
the organ. The Press Club Quartet, con
sisting of Frank M. Coffin, R. Fletcher Til
ton, S. E. Tucker and D. M. Warde and
the Colonial Quartet, composed of Misses
Florence Doane, Ivy Gardner, Mary Mann
and Clara Heyiuan, each rendered selec
tions. In addition to this, solos were fur
nished by Miss Florence Doane, Miss Eivia
Cox Seabrooke, Rhys Thomas, Mile. Flor
ence Garri^sere and Miss Mary Mann.
A portion of the impressive memorial
service of the order was read by J. R.
Howell, exalted ruler, with responses by
the officers. Rabbi M. B. Levy delivered
tbe invocation. The opening ode of the
service of sorrow was sung by the mem
bers who occupied seats in the front part
ot the hall.
The eulogy was delivered by Judge J. H.
Tarn, a member of the order, ile ex
plained that while San Francises Lodge
No. 3 would have particularly in mind its
own members who hid departed during
the year, Ernest Thevnet, John J. Don
nelly and Alfred Bechstein, the service
was also in commemoration of all tho
members of the brotherhood who had
passed away. In part, he said:
"Brother Elks, ladies and gentlemen:
With us the brotherhood of man is not
alone a theory. We seek to make it sv
practice. The primary objects of the or
der of Elks are to aid the sick and dis
tressed, cheer the weak and despondent,
and make of its members better fathers,
brothers and sons. It makes no noisy
proclamation of its kindly deeds upon the
street corners, neither does the blare cf
trumpets announce that a wound has been
healed or a fallen brother raised. We do
not discourage industry and attention
of our members to business, but we would
teach that wealth is not the chief aim of
life.
, 'To-day all over this land the Elks are
met together to do honor to our dear de
parted. We gather not to weep, but
rather to ioucH ihe heart strings with
tender mention ot those who were our
affectionate friends and brothors. We
came witb a joyful confidence that with
them all is well. They have pone where
there is no death and where darkness is
no more.
'"On this solemn day we write the faults
of our departed comrades upon the sand,
their virtues upon the imperishable tab
lets of love. He that lives in life so as to
be remembered after death in the love of
friends iius erected a momument more
lasting than stone. We come and go
hence, we know not whither. We are
tike the decayed leaves borne on the
wind, fulfilling the divine plan of our
mpker."
The speaker closed his eulogy with a
quotation from "Thanatopsls."
An appreciated number of the pro
gramme was the reading by Wilton
I Lackayeot Tennyson's "Memoriam." All
I the latent beauty and tenderness of the
poem was effectively brought out by Mr.
Lackaye's rendition, and the solemn
silence that pervaded the congregation
signified the impressiveness of the solemn
sentiments.
After closing ceremonies by the lodge.
Rev. J. A. Emery, rector of the Church of
the Advent, dismissed the congregation
with a benediction.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Now for Congress.
Grover, cut your menage short.
.Get a club ready for the funding bill.
This week holiday trading will begin in
earnest.
It is to be a short session and let us hope
it will be sweet.
The Dingley bill suits ttie wool men, but
there are others.
Cleveland may be willing to approve a
compromise tariff bill, but the country
isn't.
It is probable the Cubans expect about
as much from Cleveland's message as
we do.
The coming horse show may not be the
best in the Union, but it will be the beat
we ever saw.
The movement for the appointment of a
Secretary of Mines and Mining should
show itself in Congress at once.
It is better to make war on the cobble
stones of our streets than to continue in
definitely to do business on them.
There is a chance that the Kansas Legis
lature will turn Peffer down for some other
Populist, and any change will suit the
country.
David Bennett Hill will crawl out of his
hole long enough to go to the Senate, but
the hole will not be closed up before he re
turns to it aEain.
If McKinley does not hurry up nnd an
nounce his Cabinet very soon there are
lots of people who are going to guess them*
selves bald-headed.
The twenty-five improvement clnb3 of
the City will never iully complete their
work until they have infused their public
spirit into the people generally.
Those who are demanding an "emer
gericy" tariff bill should remember the
emergency calls for protection to industry
as well as a revenue for the Government.
In testing the new electric machine at
the Ohio penitentiary for execution pur
poses the officials tried it first on a dog,
then on a mule and are now ready proba
bly to try it on a Supervisor.
The Boston Board of Health has issued
a regulation forbidding spitting in street
cars under a penalty not exceeding $100,
and the tobacco-chewers of the city will
have to cultivate the bicycle.
The Dingley bill is not so bad but that
there are people who think they can
amend it, nor bo dead but that they de
clare they can revive it. so there is a fight
ing chance for the measure after all.
It was noted at tue Fruit-growers' Con
vention that Democrats as well as Repub
licans joined in the memorial asking Con
gress for a protective duty on fruit. It is
always so. Free trade is something we
wish the other fellow to practice.
A conference of silver leaders at Wash
ington iÂ« said to have resulted in an ad
mitted failure to combine the various fac
tions into one organization and this seems
to imply a collapse of the fusion move
ment and a return of all silverites of the
last campaign to their former parties.
Republican Congressmen-elect in In
diana are said to have agreed to leave the
selection of Postmasters to be appointed
by the incoming administration to the
election of Republican voters of the vari
ous town?, and the agreement is recaivinc
a cood deal of approval in other States.
The revival of prosperity will probably
bring a large number of tourists to Cali
fornia this winter, and among them we
may reasonably expect a considerable
number of investors and home-seekers,
for whom our reviving industries and our
genial climate will have irresistible attrac
tions.
According to Dr. Grace Kimball, who
has recently returned from Armenia, the
missionaries in the interior of that coun
try look \o the iiritish and not to the
American flag for protection, and if this
is so it is high time we had a little more
vigor in the State Department at Wash
ington.
In a recent speech Bourke Cockran said :
"I am tired of masquerading as a tariff re
former. 1 am a free-trader, and I have
donned political disgui*e3 for the la^t
time." Now then if otber Democrats will
be equally honest the people will know ex
actly tne Issue before them and the tariff
question will toon be out of politic;.
The Boston Herald gives notice that the
culture of that city does not care how bad
morality may pronounce the Bacchante
to long as it is pronounced in two syl
lables. In the chvsic courts of Boston's
library it is permitted to say "Ba-kant"
or "Bak-ktnt," but whoever calls it any
thing else is spotted as a Chicago man.
At the recent Anthropological congress
in Geneva a professor of criminology
quoted statistics showing that the greater
proportionate number of criminals is
found among those who toil with their
brains instead of with their hands, Dut he
attributes this to the fact that brain
workers are more trusted and have more
opportunities for crime, thus indorsing
the old saying, "the occasion makes the
roj;ue."
WORK FOR CONGRESS.
It is not probable the session of Con
gress which beeins to-day will undertake
much, if any, legislation of a partisan
character. The condition of the Senate is
such that no measure of such a nature
would have much prospect of success, and
consequently if anything is attempted in
the way of tariff or monetary legislation
it will be at best no more than a com
promise.
The short sessions of Congress rarely
achieve much beyond the passage of rou
tine appropriation bills. The present
session, however, has an opportunity of
improving upon its predecessors in this
respect, for there will be much work be
fore it of a non-partisan character, and
some of these measures are of such im
portance they are not less in public inter
est than even the great issnes on which
parties are divided.
Of these the three most important will
be the settlement of the Pacific road^s
debt, the Nicaragua canal and a measure
to promote the expansion of our commerce
by the upbuilding of an American mer
chant marine. Iv all of these California
will be interested, and particularly in the
funding bill. The session therefore, lor
us at any rate, will be as interesting as
any that has been held for a long time,
and our delegation at Washington will be
kept busy in looking after the interests of
the State.
In addition to these measures of general
interest there will be many others of con
siderable importance under consideration
during the winter. Among them may be
noted a biil already before the Senate to
provide for the establishment of a Depart
ment of Commerce and one which will
probably be introduced to establish a De
partment of Mines and Mining. The
question of immigration restriction will re
ceive attention, and probably some im
portant amendments will be made to the
existing law. Another bill which will be
brought up for decision at this session
will be that of Congressman Loud to cure
the abuses of the law relating to second
class mail matter; acd finally there will
be the Wadswortb bill for tbe creation of
a Bureau of Animal Industry for the in
spection of meat intended for use as food
either at home or abroad.
When it is remembered that the total
number of bills now before ihe House and
in the hands of its committees is in excess
of 1400, it will be seen that it will have
enough to do even if it makes no attempt
at tariff legislation. Tbis fact will prob
ably have much influence in determining
the decision of the Republican caucus in
regard to the policy to be pursued on the
subject of tariff reform. If any attempt
is made at devising a tariff, that will be
of course the chief fight of tbe session, but
otherwise we may expect the main inter
est to center in the struggle over the
funding bill.
BALLOT MACHINES.
The first reports whicn came of the re
sults of voting by ballot mac ines seem to
have been altogether too favorable. Ad
verse criticism is now being pronounced
on the subject and there is abundant evi
dence compiled by Public Opinion to show
that neither of the machines tried at the
last election is at all satisfactory.
It is stated the Myers Company have
been obliged to set about devising changes
in the doors and outside casing of their
machine, while the McTammany Com
pany recognize that theirs does not codtit
well ana are arranging to improve the de
fect. Both machines seem to have occa
sioned tne loss of a considerable number
of votes during the election, and it is on
that ground the main objections to them
are based.
The Providenc? Journal in giving an ac
count of the operation of the machine used
in Massachusetts says: "A former Judge
of Worcester entered and issued forth
from the McTammany cage witliout vot
ing. On taking the oath provided for such
emergencies he was permitted to try
again." If a citizen of such intelligence
as a Judge may be presumed to be could
not operate the machine it is fair to as
sume that a considerable number of oth
ers have tried it and failed also.
The Ltica Herald refers to the fact that
upward of 200 voters in a single precinct
in Rochester where the Myers machine
was triea lost their votes, and very justly
says: "It would have been hardly possi
ble to cast 200 defective blanket "ballots.
Even if it were, the fault would have been
that of the voters. In the case, however,
of a man who touches a knob that fails to
record his vote the fault rests wholly with
the machine."
The general conclusion of the press in
the East upon the subject.where all the ex
periments were watched with close atten
tion, is fairly well expressed in the state
ment of the New York Tribune that the
voting machine is not yet a practical suc
cess. Of the various leading machines ex
perimented with it says : "Not one appar
ently stood the required test. All proved
more or less ua satisfactory, ana the im
perfections in most instances were of a
serious character."
That each of the machines tried has
some merit is beyond question, but a
Dalloting machine oufjht not to be adopted
unless it is so perfect that it will unfail
ingly record every vote that is given. It
will not do to trust the franchise of citi
zens to machines that are not certain to
register the votes. It is asserted with the
Myers machine that in one precinct six
teen ballots had been cast before the ma
chine registered at all. These men were
clearly disfranchised through no fault of
their own, and the machine to that extent
was actually a fraud upon the voters.
It is fairly certain some effort will be
made during the session of the Legisla
ture this winter to provide for machine
balloting in this State. It wiil, therefore,
be well for the people to be on their guard
in the matter. The election of officials is
too important to be left to the hazard of
mere experiment, and if we are to have
any such thing as a voting machine
adopted for use in thi3 State great care
should be tnken to see to it that it is
something more than an experiment and
wiil unfailingly register accurately the
vote of every citizen.
THE HAMBURG EXHIBIT.
At the International Horticultural Ex
hibition which is to be held in Hamburg,
Germany, beginning on the Ist of next
May, the State of California should be
sure to attend to the business maxim,
"Make yourself known and favorably
known."
The State Board of Trade is already be
stirring itself in the matter, but it desires
and needs the enthusiastic co-operation of
all tbe counties to make our representa
tion there a complete success. Four thou
sand feet of space has been applied for;
the steamship associations have offered
free transportation for the exhibits and
half rates for those who are in charge of
them ; and the railroads have been ap
plied to for the same concessions, and they
now have the matter under advisement.
It is fully expected that the same line of
reasoning which induced the action of the
3teamship companies will prevail with
the railways, viz., that the exhibit will
THE SAN v FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1896.
certainly result in the extension of the
shipments of dried and canned fruits from
California to Europe.
The amount necessary to pay the ex
penses of the enterprise is $3000, of which
the Board ot Trade now has for that use
$1000. The balance should be promptly
raised by the counties moat interested.
This duty being attended to success will
be assured, for there is no doubt about the
excellence of the exhibits which can be
sent. Several splendid packs have al
ready been promised.
The benefits to be derived are obvious to
any one who will consider the facts in the
case. California dried and canned fruits
can be sold in Europe at a .profit, and they
are of better quality than ttiose now on
the market there. Secretary Filcher of
the State Board of Trade says that he has
recently Dad a number of applications
from Europe asking about California
fruits and where to purchase them. Last
year only ten carloads were snipped to
Europe, and this year there were 150.
Mr. H. O. Trowbridge of Oakland, who
is a frequent visitor to Germany and is
well acquainted with the market condi
tions there, says that with proper efforts
on the part of our fruit-growers the people
within the German empire would buy at
a profit to the producers half the dried
fruits put up in California. Hamburg, it
must be remembered, is the greatest com
mercial city of the continent of Europe.
Last year the tonnage of that port was
6,256,000, and exceeded Liverpool tÂ»y about
300,000 tons. In the last ten years the
tonnage of Liverpool has increased 40 per
cent while that of Hamburg grew 70 per
cent.
To have a fine displny of our horticul
tural products on such an occasion in such
a world's mart as Hamburg woula surely
lead to the much-talked-of market exten
sion for dried and canned fruits. It is a
golden opportunity, which should be
grasped with oager 'lands.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The annual report of Secretary Francis
of the Interior Department furnislies an
indirect but strong argument for the es
tablishment of a Department of Mines
and Mining. This is done by making it
clear that the work of the luterior is too
vast and various for any single branch of
the Government and cannot be well car
ried on under present conditions.
The Secretary asks for additional build
ings for the department and in urging
their prompt construction says:
The area of our country, the variety of its
products, the diversity of its interests, the
trade and social relations between localities
and classes of people make its internal com
merce of enormous magnitude and must from
time to time necessitate enlargement of its
existing Governmect bureaus and the estab
lishment of additional ones. Provisions for
the accommodation thereof should no longer
be delayed.
A cursory reading of even the digest of
the report sent out by telegraph will show
how overloaded the Interior oitice is. The
report covers such important matters as
public lande, Indian tribes, irrigation, pen
sions, railroads and the Nicaragua canal.
Each of these divisions includes impor
tant subdivisions, such as homesteads, for
estry, mineral lands and Pacific roads
debts. So large and so varied, indeed,
were the subjects with which he bad to
deal that from the summary of his report
which has been given out the Secretary
seems to have found no space in which to
make any notice whatever of the mining
industry.
With so many kinda of Governmental
work to.attend to it is not to be wondered
at that the Secretary wishes more bureaus
for taking charge of special branches of
the work and more office room for the
workers. It would seem, however, that
the best solution of the problem would be
the creation of other departments to take
control of some of tiie more important
branches of the work now intrusted to the
Interior. Two additional departments
have, in fact, been Spoken of â one of com
merce and the otber of mines. Each of
these is sufficient to justify the supervi
sion of a Cabinet official and there would
still be work enough left in the Interior
office to tax the energies of even tbe great
est statesmen.
The growth of the United States in
population, wealth and industry necessi
tates periodical enlargements of the de
partments of the Government. The su
pervision which was sufficient a few years
ago is inadequate now and will be wholly
incompetent iv a short time. The work
of the Interior muit be subdivided in or
der that justice may be done to the great
industries affected by its management,
and among them none better merits a de
partment of its own than that of mines
and mining.
COAST EXOHANGES.
Ths Emeryville Journal is the latest addi
tion to the list of weekly newspapers of Ala
meda County. The editor and manager, C. C.
Etnslie, declares that it is no ephemeral publi

response to a healthy demand in the ; growing
village that has just been incorporated. The

,The Los Angeles Express is devoting much
attention to the new mining interests in the
Mojave country. It speaks ' as follows on the
subject: , , [
"The gold discoveries in the Randsburg dis
trict have created a sensation among the min
ing experts who have examined the deposits
and studied the formation in which they are
found. No such developments have been
made in this country in recent years, accom
panied as they are by such peculiar arid un
usual features. Here are vast deposits of gold
bearing rock appearing above the natural sur
face of the mountains and going down to un
known depth. So far as development work ex
tends these ledges show strength and richness
wherever exposed. : Considering, the amount
of prospecting done the leading properties
may be considered wonderful."

ject : of spreading ~ the 1 municipality of i the
Angelenos all over Southern California. The
publication has many merits, and ought to
win success.
The Post-Intelligencer of Seattle, Washington,
has set an admirable example to ; newspapers
everywhere outside of California. It gives its
readers an opportunity to vote for a favorite
school teacher, and the educator receiving the
highest vote will be awarded the prize of a
tea days' pleasure trip to Â£aa Francisco at the
expense of the enterprising Post-Intelligencer.
The Seattle daily may well expatiate on the
good fortune that will have fallen to the lot of
the teacher whose luck it will be to enjoy a
California Christmas and New Year.
Butte County seems to have struck a profit
able lead in the growth of hemp along its
river bottoms. The Chico Chronicle-Record
has this to say of the subject: An Eastern
capitalist leased a tract of about 200 acres of
bottom land along Feather River and last win
ter planted this land to hemp. The crop is
now being out, and the growth of the product
is something remarkable when compared with
that produced in the Eastern States. That
planted near Gridley has attained an enor
mous height, a itreat deal of it being about six
teen feet tall. This is a great success when
one considers that the first three feet of the
hemp stock will pay the expenses of sowing,
cutting, crushing and preparing the fiber for
the market. The hemD, after it has reached
the proper stage for cutting, is mowed down
with an ordinary mower. It is then allowed
to lie on the ground and go through what is
called rotting. After a required length of
time has elapsed the hemp stalks are shocked
up in a manner similar to corn. It is then
hauled to the crushing-mill, where the stalks
are rolled between two heavy cos: cylinders.
This breaks up the wood, which is afterward
easily separated from the fiber. This fiber,
when properly prepared, commands a market
price of between 7 and 8 cents per pound, and
the cost of shipping is nominal compared with
the selling value. If this experiment proves
successfulâ and all indications are flattering
that it willâ we will undoubtedly see in the
course of the next few years hemp fields scat
tered all along our river bottoms.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The British cruiser Leander, built in 1882,
is having her battery of 6-inch, breech-loading
rifles replaced with teu G-inch quick-firers.
The cost, including refit, will amount to $150,
-000.
A Japanese volunteer fleet is under consid
eration among retired naval officers of that
country. It is planned to consist of nine
steamers, ranging from 3000 to GOOO tons dis
placement, and fourteen steamers oi 500 to
3000 tons displacement. In times of peace the
larger steamers will run between ports of
Japan, Australia and America, and the smaller
class will be employed on the routes to China.
There is only one cruiser afloat faster than
the Yoshino, which is credited with a speed of
23 knotsâ the Argentine cruiser Buenos Aires,
having a trial speed of 23.2 knots. In the
event of complications with foreign countries
the Yoshino and tne two ?hips contracted for
in the United States would prove troublesome
commerce destroyers, as no European navy
possesses any vessels that could overhaul the
Japanese ships.
The frequent dismal failures of French
vessels-of-war is chiefly due to changes
of naval administrations, each new one hav
ing its particular hobby to ride. The blame
for over-weighted, unseaworthy ships is there
fore not to be laid to the constructors, but
rather upon the superiors who, during their
brief period of authority, make radical changes
in vessels under construction, and as a rule no
armored vessel which takes years to build in a
dockyard is anywhere near the original design
when finally completed.
The Jeaureguiberry, begun at LaSeynein
1891 and launched in 1893, nas just had her
gun trials, which were satisfactory. Electric
power is used for the turret and ammunition
gear, and there is no hydraulic machinery
whatever on board. The turreta are ho placed
as to have an unvarying center of gravity and
may be worked by hand in case of accident to
the electric power. She is of an entirely dif
ferent type from the Hoche, Neptune and Ma
genta, having only moderate superstructures,
and is therefore likely to prove a good ship at
sea.
There are twenty-four 100 and 105 ton guns
of 17-inch caliber in the Italian navy, carried
on the Duilio, Doria, Lauria, L.-panlo, Moro
sini, Italia and Dandolo. It is contemplated
to replace these monster guns with more mod
erate-sized ordnance, and the Dandolo has
already been fitted with four 10-inch rifles
and seven U-inch, quick-firing guns. The fact
that some of the 17-inch guns have been in
service since 1878 and have therefore long
ago fired their 100 rounds, which is said to
constitute their lifetime, may account for this
material reduction in armament.
An Austrian naval officer has invented a
night signal system for use at sea. The appar
atus, constructed fifteen years ago, was tried
last month at Pola, the Austrian naval port,
and gave good results. It consists of two
lamps of 200 candle-power each, containing
five systems, namely : A fixed white ligl.t, a
fixed red light, a white flashlight, a red flash
lieht and a white and red flashlight. Thirty
signals, therefore, can be given with two of
these lamps, which are visib'e at a great dis
tance. The mechanism is independent of
weighting-power and is in no way affected by
the movements of the ship.
THE CYCLODIAL CHARIOT.
Something new in the way of big wheels will
be erected at the centennial celebration to be

cor with a capacity of forty persons. This
wheel will be mounted on elevated tracks and
will move forward as it revolves, and will thus
make a tour of the entire ground. If the
schÂ«me is a success such a wheel will be
erected at Atlantic City. The wheel is the in
vention of William J. Cronin and is called the
cyclodial chariot.

IS THIS PORT
LOSING GROUND?
Drops to Third Place in
the Matter of Oriental
Imports.
Tacoma Has Reached Second
Place and Is Steadily Gain
ing Ground.
Report of Produce Exchange Shews a
Healthier and Stronger Market
Thaa Last Year.
According to the latest reports received
here from the New York Chamber of Com
merce, the Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco and the business men of the
City must take cognizance of the fact that
in the oriental import trade San Francisco
is not gaining any ground. As a matter
of fact, she has been losing ground year by
year, until, from the second place in the
matter cf imports into the Unitea States,
she has dropped in 1896 to third place.
Tacoma, Wash., which last year was in
third place, ha 3 superseded San Francisco
in second place, and from the rate of in
crease In the oriental import trade with
the United States Tacoma bids fair to take
tirit place in the United States as she has
on the Pacific Coast. All this trade orig
inally belonged to and was held by San
Francisco.
Tacoma ranks second only to New York
City in the number of packages handled
and the value of merchandise imported
during the year now nearly closed. A
year aco New York City ranked first, San
Francisco becond and Tacoma third. To
day San Francisco, the principal city and
the great commercial metropolis of the
Pacific Coast, is in second place, and
Tacoma, the new metropolis of the
Northwest, a city of 30,000 population,
is the second city in the United
States in point of oriental import?.
She not only has second place, but she
has nearly three times as many packages
to her import credit as her rival, San
Franc:sco.
The value of imports of the several lead
ing ports is as follows:
New York, 1,279,709 packages, value $27,
-932,210.
Tacoma, G21.7G3 packages, value $4,738.
-928.
s*n Francisco, 244,024 packages, value i? 4,.
533.920.
Baltimore, 245,668 packages, value $2,008,
-921.
Portland, 146,154 packages, value $1,322,
-715.
Philadelphia, 40,461 packages,value $2,221,
-261.
Boston, 94,927 packages, value $1,729,340.
Doubtless the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company is fuily aware of these facts. An
indication of this is seen in the fact that
at the last meeting of tue directors of this
company, heid in New York City a few
weeks ago, a resolution was adouted di
recting the construction or a new Pacific
Mail steamer to ost not less than $800,000.
The details of the construction of this
steamship have not yet been prepared.
At least, Vice-President Schwerin of San
Francisco says he knows nothing of when
or where the steamship ia to be con
structed.
At the same time the news comes that
trie Northern Pacific Steamship Company
intends to add to its fleet two magnificent
new steamships with large passenger ac
commodations to its Tacoma-Yokohania-
Hongkong route. These ships have been
purchased in England and will shortly j
leave Liverpool for Tacoma, necessarily, i
pending the construction of the Nicaragua â 
canal, by way of Cape Horn.
The fact that the .Fac.fic Mail Company
has ordered a new steamship to be built
for the ban Francisco oriental tiade indi
cates that there is to be a more lively
competition than ever before for the
control of the bulk of the oriental trade.
The Tacoma and Victoria steamers will
make an effort to secure the reputation of
being the shortest route and affording the
more rapid transit.
The report of the San Francisco Produce
Exchange, dated December 1, shows a
very healthy improvement in the demand
for California cereals as compared with
last year.
The number of barrels of flour remain
ing in the State on December 1 was
111.078; wheat, 7,495,380 centals; barley
3,008,980 centals; oats, 189,360 centals;
beans. 700,963 sacks; rye, 81,340 centals.
In 1895 the amount of flour and cereals j
remaining in the State on the same date
was: Fiour, 82,107 barrels; wheat, 10,941,

The Nicaraguan bark Sharpshooter, Cap
tain Kustel, which arrived in yesterday,
reports exirnordinarily rough weather.
She was 78 days from Newcastle, Aus

countered very severe gales. She was
boarded by a sea, which swept her decks
clean, smashing the gie and carrying
away tLe figure-bead. For thirty-seven
days, from October 17 to November 23, she
made only an average of seventy-two
miles a day. The wind was then light to
moderate. Captain Kustel reports no
trade wind whatever.

SUNDAY CYCLE RACES.
A Large Crowd Witnesses Good Sport
at the Velodrome Track.
Club Ruria.
If Bunday cycle track racing is ever
inaugurated on this coast it will probably
be well patronized. Just now the League
of American Wheelmen's rules forbid it,
though it seems likely that at the next
annual meeting in February it may be
sanctioned. Yesterday some matinee
races were held at the Velodrome track,
to which the admission was free, as there
is no rule against holding Sunday races
where no prizes are given and no entrance
charged. The crowd present was immense,

A five-mile inter-club race between the
Olympic Club wheelmen and the Reliance
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1896.
Club wheelmen was won by the Olympics.
The teams were Kroetz, Werner, Fuller,
Loos and Cook for the Olympics, and Bain,
Neylan, Mott, Elford and Gooch, Reliance.
Time, 13:33.
J. E. Wing, Olympic, rode a half-mile
exhibition, paced by the Bizon-Loos tan
dem team, in fifty-nine seconds.
W. E. Becker, professional five-mi!e
national champion, rode an unpaced third
of a mile in 40 3-5 seconds, coast record.
A match race at one-half mile, between
Messrs. Haley, Reyalk and Griffith, cap
tains of the Olympic, Acme and Reliance
clubs respectively, was won by Haley, Re
valK second. Griffiths lost his pedal, or
he might have altered tuis result.
Crowds of racers were training at the
track all day preparing for the meet next
Saturday, and some pretty good sprints
were witnessed between Wells, Foster,
Becker, McFarland, Stevens and other
crack professionals.
The management of the track threatens
to refuse "Bob" Ten-ill's entries hereafter,
because he failed to ride last Saturday in
the shield race, as he was advertised to do.
As Terrill is very popular with the public,
and is a big drawing card, ii would hardly
seem a wise move.
Walter Foster is riding unattached now,
having left the Olympics for some reason
or other. He appeared without their em
blem Saturday in a new racing suit and
entered as unattached.
The next meeting of the associated clubs
will be held at the Acme Club, Oakiand,
in February.
The Bay City Wheelmen's pool tourna
ment has narrowed down to six players â
Pike, Leavitt, Hall, Kellom, Menne and
Spalding. Tbe deciding games will be
played this week.
Many of the racers now quartered at the
Velodrome tract: will go to Fresno for the
big meet to be held there on the 19th in
stant.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen and
Olympic Ulub Wheelmen held an enjoy
able joint run to the park yesterday. The
San Francisco Road Club went to Menlo
Park, and the Imperial and California
clubs to the beach.
Entries for next Saturday's Velodrome
meet close to-night. On Christmas day
Otto Zieglefr, Arthur Gardiner, McFarland

FELL FROM THE TRUCK
An Acrobat Injured by a Fall
ing Sphere Containing His
Wife.
It Droppei From Is Spiral Pathway
.and Startled an Orpheum
Audience.
The performance at the Orphenm yes
terday afternoon culminated in a stage
accident that was not on the programme
The Little Woman and the Sphere
She "Was Encased In When It
Fell Off the Spiral Track and
Nearly Broke Her Husband's
Necku
and that came near resulting very seri
ously to two acrobats.
A woman inclosed in a hollow metal
sphere that rolls mysteriously up and then
down a tortuous spiral pathway lost con
trol, through some fault in its mechan
ism, of the ball in which she was doubled
up and securely incased, and the weighty
mass, human occupant and all, jumped
the track on the down trip, feil off at a
tangent and struck ihe woman's husband
violently on the right shoulder juÂ«t as he
lunged forward instinctively to save his
wife.
He tripped at a critical moment and was
injured himself, while breaking the^orce
of the fall of his helplessly imprisoned
companion.
The man, a sturdy Frenchman of pow
erful athletic build, was seen to ride hast
ily from the stage, grasp his ri^'ht shoul
der and retreat into th â  wing". The cur
tain was immediately rung down, only a
second or so, however, sooner than, it ordi
narily would have been.
An examination into the locked sphere
disclosed the fact that the woman's in
juries consisted simply of a hard knock
on one side ot her head. Her first anx
iety on being liberated from her cramped
little prison was for the condition of her
husband.
On the bills the woman is Ellen Vetter,
the "mysterious spiral globe artiste." Her
"act" consists in rolling over and over
while in a cramped po3ition, and propel
ling the sphere along its peculiar course,
the charm of the performance lying
chiefly in the wonderment occasioned
among the spectators as to the nature of
the locomotivo power of the apparently
self-controlled, airy, baloon-looking globe,
the small size of which is not suggestive
of the possibility of human occupancy.
The husband is billed as "Lang- low, the
shooting-star." He is a crack rifle shot
and tight- wire periormer, cracking glass
balls and cutting out bullseyes, while
vibrating on one foot or hanging by both
toes from a small wire stretched* high
above the heads of the spectators.
his injury, while not serious, is upon a
shoulder that was dislocated in Berlin
last May by a similar accident, and is
sufficient probably to prevent his perform
ing during the present week, which was
to have been the last of his engagement in
this City. The symmetry of the meiallic
ball and the inierior catches connecting
the two hollow hemispheres were dam
aged si ffic:ently to make it impossible for
the little woman to take pan in the even
ing performance even had she not felt
dazed from the blow she received after
falling about eight feet.
Died From Heart Disease.
Robert Nagler, an aged truss manufacturer
who occupied rooms at 410 Kearny street,
dropped dead, presumably from heait disease,
in a saloon, 719 Market street. The body was
removed to ihe >forgue. The old man bad
been suffering from a complication of diseases
for several years and his death was not unex
pected.

ITALIAN STRONG
MEN EXHIBIT
Interesting Exhibition of
Two San Francisco
Clubs.
Frank Paolini and Ciro Cuneo
Win P pular Athletic
Victories.
Expert Swordsmen Give Expositions
of the Science of Thrust and
Parry.
The brawn and athletic skill of the Ital
ian colony had an inning last night and
acquitted itself bravely. The occasion
was a joint exhibition of the Massanielio
Frank Paclini, a Muscular Member
of the Masaniello Who Claims
to Be Champion Wrestler of
the Pacific Coast.
Parise and the Gladiators' clubs at Wash
ington-square Hail. A dance followed the
athletic exhibition and the affair was quite
a society event in the colony.
Tbe programme opened with a three
round boxing match between Jimmy Sim
mons, a diminutive colored boy, and a
midget named Johnny Dugan. The little
fellows, neither of whom could turn the
scale at 70 pounds, pummeled each other
with agility and industry, but no damage
was done, and the referee declared it a
draw.
CD. Paoliof the Gladiators and H. Simi
of the Mas<?aniello followed in a spirited
three-round contest. In the second round
Paoli received a jolt on tiie jaw which per
ceptibly lessened his vim, and the con.
test was awarded to Simi.
V. W. Monti, president and instructor
of the Massanielio, and D. Martini, who oc
cupied a like position in the Gladiators,
gave an interesting exhibition of broad
sword play. B. Dominici and Martini
also gave an exposition of tuis art.
The event around which the chief in
terest of the evening centered was the
wrestling match between Frant Piiolini,
who styles himself champion bf the Pacific
Coast ami is the pride of the Massanielio,
and L. Pellegrini. The latter, although
handicapped greatly Id the matter of
weight, took the aggressive and appar
ently wore himself out, when Paolini
turned him over for the first fall. The
second fall vras also secured by Paolini.
Young Ciro Ctmeo, the Clever
Feather - Weight Who Was
. Awarded a Decision Over Joe
Duewell in a Three - Round
Contest.
No time was taken. A match for ?100
was immediately arranged for by the
wrestlers.
V. W. Monte and E. C. Baccala gave a
scientific expo-ition of the proper hand
ling of dueling rapiers which was tighiy
appreciated.
T.,e final event was i three-round con
test between young Ciro Cuneo, adver
tised as feather-weight champion of the
coast, and Joe Donwcli. The boxers
seemed witling to sacr flee themselves for
the sake of a good mill, and the contest
was give and take throughout. Cuneo
was awarded the decision.
L. Ratto, V. W. Monti and C. E. Bac
cala acted as fencing referees. L. Ratto
and A, Gallo judged the boxing and
wrestling. Mucn of the success or the oc
casion was due to the enercretic manage
ment of Mr. Monti, who had the entire
affair in charge.
The Symphony Concert Announced.
In nearly all the churches yesterday an
nouncement was made of the coming grand
concert to take place at the Association audi

SUPERVISORS STUDY.
Those Who Will Serve for the Next
Two Years Seek Information From
Mayor Sutro.
By invitation of Mayor Sutro, Mayor
elect Phelan and nine of the Supervisors
elect visited Sutro Heights and took lunch
with him yesterday afternoon.
"I invited the entire board, as well as
Mr. Phelan," said Mayor Sutro, as I
wished to become acquainted with the
gentlemen. All the Supervisors but thne
were present, but tt^e were unavoidably
absent. I was very favorably impressed
with tbe gentlemen and was pleased to
note their inqui&itiveness in regard to
City matters and what is most needed.
They asked many questions in regard to
various branches of tbe government of
the City and were particularly anxious to
be miornied on the subject of streets and
anxious pavements. They seemed to ob
tain all the information they coulu as to
the best pavements and how they ought
to be laid.
"Having had considerable experience in
such matters, and having insi ected the
various kinds of pavement of the princi
pal cities of the Old World, London, Paris,
Berlin and other places where I made that
the subject of my researches and observa
tion, I told them that what the City needs
for pavements that will last is in the first
place a solid foundation, and that can be
secured only by the use of ocean sand,
which is the only kind that ought to be
used, as it is free from tbe matter which
in hill sand disintegrates and causes foun
dations to give.
"Then on that there should be a good bed
of broken rock iaid with cement to form a
tirst-cla>s concrete, and the rock that
should be used mibt ba of that kind that
will 'take' the cement and form a mass as
solid as rock and on that bitumen can be
laid. I also told them about the laying of
basait blocks on the section where there is
heavy teaming and then gave them my
knowledge of the proper kind of rock to
use for macadamizing.
"They were also desirous of knowing
about the Rattier test and there was some
talk about our sewer system. They ex
pressed themselves as grateful for tlin in
formation imparted and 1 was pleased to
note their interest to become advised as to
their duty to the citizens."
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Amateur Champion Donnelly and J. C.
Nfiilini Defeat <J. Hnrlow and
Kd Maloney.
There was a large attendance at tbe San
Francisco handball court yesterday to
witness several exciting games. The prin
cipal attraction was a game in which P.
T. Donneliy, the amateur champion, and
J. C. Neaion played auainst J. Harlow and
Ed Maloney. The play was spirited
throughout, both teams displaying rare
judgment. Donnely and Naalon won the
linal game by five aces. A return match
will be played next Sunday.
Another interesting game was played
between the old time rivals Phil Ryan and
D. Rogers and M. McNeil and George Mc-
Donald. The two former had been prac
ticing diligently during the week ana the
result was they won the final with ease.
The Union Court is still closed, bat it is
expected to be in full swing again by next

lowing named officers Wednesday night:
Hugh J. Owen, W. M.; Carroll Cook, S. W. ; A.
McNair, J. W ; Aaron Doud, T. ; Theodore* E.
Smith, secretary. The annual reports of the
treasurer and secretary show the lodge in a
flourishing condition.
M. Goldsmith was elected secretary of Doric
Lodge last week, v cc E. Kronberg, deceased.
This being the banquet season, the craft will
be frequently called this month from labor to
refreshments.
. Shortly before retiring from office Grand
Master Preston pave it as his Masonic opinion
that lodges must not use the funds of the lodge
for the purpose of purchasing jewels for retir
ing officers, consequently, if the custom of I
presentations is to be continued, incoming i
masters and warders will have to go among
the craft for the necessary amount.
The indications are that an effort will be j
made to get new men in the directory of
the Masonic Hall Association at tbe annual
election.
Tne ides is growing with Masons that It is way*
better to vote for a g.~>od lodge than for "a good
fellow" to till an office.
There is cons.derable discussion at thl* time as
to mho stall be tbe next chairman of the beard of
niter.
Grand Lectuier W. "H. Edwards, having in the
past successfully taught the young idea how to
shoot, is now trying bis band In the same line on ;

The late R. v. W. U. Hill, who at the time of his
death recen ly whs the o aest Episcopal clergy

TWO LIMES Of
HARBOR DEFENSE
Interior Chain of Forts on
Angel Island, Aicatraz
and Fort Mason.
Batteries Will Command Raccoon
I traits to Protect Mare
Island Navy- Yard.
Renew, d Activity on Defensive Work.
Exterior Lines Extended to
Point Boaita.
Under direction of engineer officers a
large force of men is now engaged in the
work of fortifying the harbor of San Fran
cisco. No greater activity has been mani
fested since the board of fortification
adopted the general plan of defense. The
most activity is displayed at Fort Point
where the 10-inch guns are to be placed in
position on disappearing carriages. Em
placements for other heavy rifles are be
ing constructed there. It is understood
that additional 12-mch rifles will be
mounted still further out.
At Lime Point, on the Marin side of the
channel, there are two 12-inch riflesâ one
in position ana the otner on the ground.
The engineers have determined to build
two more forts near Point Bonita. Tne
plan adopted by the board of fortifications
is known only to the Secretary of War,
the general of the army and the engineers,
but the recent examination of the ground
near Point Bonita by General Forsyth and
Major Davis and Lieutenant Potter of the
Engineer Corps indicates that work will
soon begin in that vicinity.
Army officers familiar the worlc
already done here, and the progress of
similar work on the Atlantic coast, express
the opinion that San Francisco is in bet
ter shape to resist attack from the ocean
than any otuer city on the continent. The
batteries on either sido of the channel at
the entrance to the Golden Gate consist of
powerful guno, of ten anl twelve inch cal
iber. Added to these are the rifled moni
tors and dynamite guns.
It is now known that the Board of Forti
fications will render the harbor doubly
secure by fortifying an interior line. The
heaviest rifled guns will be placed in posi
tion at Aicatraz It-land, Angel Island and
Fort Mason. Ttie scheme may also in
clude U;e building of a fort on Goat Island.
It is remotely possible, but not proba
ble, that some resolute admiral of the
Farragut and Nelson type migtit, in a gen
eral attack, get one ship through the
Golden Gate and into the harbor of Sun
Francisco. To prevent a hostile ship in
sucu position lrom doing incalcu.able
damage the guns of the interior line of
forts would be used. Angel Is:and bat
teries should command Raccoon Straits
and stop a raid on Mare Island Navy
Yard and Benicia Arsenal. Heavy guns
at Aicatraz and Black Point should take
care of a hostile ship on this side of the
bay.
The heavy batteries of the Third Artil
lery stationed at Angel Island, Aicatraz
and Fort Mason will drill at the 12-inch
rifles and the 12-inrh rifled mortars on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday of this week, and on the same
days next week. The steamer General
McDowell will carry the troops from the
island posts to the Presidio and return.

programme is submitted by Captain Ches
ter, Third Artillery, commanding officer
of that r>oÂ«t. Aside from the recitations
embracing many problems, there will be
seven essays as follows:
March 2. 1897â Captain Chester: "Plan for
the defense of the harbor and city of Pensa
cola against an attack by eUht armored ves
sels ol the class of H. M. B, Majestic, accom
panied b\ - eight torpedu-boats and the usual
complement of torpedo-boat catchers and
other necessary vessels." A general presenta
tion of ihe subject.
Mnrch 9, 18!>7 â Captain Hess: '^ome
thoughts on practical education in the army."
March 10, 1897â Lieutenant Raudoiph:
â 'The present Â»tae of the fortification ques
tion."
Match 2:5, 1897â Lieutenant Ludlow: "The
causes oi jump."
March 30, 1897â Lieutenant Rumbough:
"The defense ol ban Francisco Bay against a
naval attacK."
April 5, 1897â Lieutensnt Haan: "Direct
and indirect tire with modern guns in time of
war."
April 12, 1897â Lieutenant Ames: "The use
of three arms in attack and defense."
Furloughs have been granted to Fred G.
Friepd, Light Battery C, Third Artillery,
and Jerry O'Leary, Company B, First
Infantry.
Troopers of the Fourth Cavalry are glad
enough to get home to the Presidio for the
winter. Tne bar at the Pont Exchange has
been extended so thitt forty men can line
up at one time Now that there are twelve
comnnn.es at tl.e post the exchange does
a thriving business.
The Army and Navy Journal has this
paragraph: "Cnptain Frantt Thorp and
Light Battery D, Fifth Artillery, fresh
from California, presented a handsome
appearance in New York City on Novem
ber 23, Evacuation day, when the battery
paraded with the Old Guard and tired a
salute."
KOSEWATER SERMONS.
Dr. Case Thinks That Kind of Discourse
Has No Force.
At the Howard-street Methodist Church
Dr. W. W. Case preached a sermon last
evening upon the subject of "Religious
Controversy," in which he emphatically
advocated controversy as needful for the
conviction of error and the finding of
truth.
He took for his toxf, "Earnestly Con
tend for the Faith Once Delivered to the
Saints," and in explaining its bearing
upon controversy said: "Is ChriÂ«t our
mouel? Then are we weak and unfaith
ful. Christ was a controversialist. He
contended against every form of error
and iniquity. His luve was wondenul, |
and while no one ever showed such pity I
for the suffering and sin ul, he oftsn used i
words of the severest conjemnaiion to
those who propagated error.
"Jesus inviiei discussion, but most
preachers ot to-d:Â»y avoid it. Modern
rosewnter sermons have no Dower over the
thought and conscience of the people.
They bear no resemblance to the preach
ing of Christ and the Apostles. They
u-ed the truth, however sharnand cutting,
but in the hands of many of the preachers
of to-day there ia no sword, but only a
plume or a feather. The sword seems to
be but little used in the modern pulpit.
Preachers try to be poetical, rhetorical,
oratorical, historical, metaphorical ; they
study expression, gesture, tone, emphasis,
but where is th* sharp sword of the
spirit? Where is the mettled and ani
mated Sadducee? Where is the fierce
Pnarisee? They are nowhere. There are
plenty of churches where Satan can go to
sleep in the audience, with nothing in the
service to disturb or alarm him. The
divine carpenter and the lowly fisnermen
are models no longer.
"We must contend for the great facts
and doctrines of the Bible; for purity of
doctrine â not in bitterness, but with
fidelity to the truth. Jesus settled his
antagonist so that no man durst ask him
any more questions. Paul was heroic be
fore Felix. The gn at French prearher,
Massillon, did not hesitate to rebuke the
King and the ladies of the court. The
tlmoscall for a heroic pulpit and for a
strong laity."
THE BIBLE AT HOME.
Dr. Spalding Urges Parents to Teach
It to Their Children.
At St. John's Episcopal Church yester
day morning, R>v. Dr. Spalding preached
from the text, Romans, 15:4: "Whatso
ever things *were written aforetime were
written for our learning, that we, through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures
might have hope."
The speaker directed attention to the
frequency with which Christ in his teach
ings referred to the Scriptures and ob
served in this connection that we of the
Christian era bad reason to thank God for
the New as well as the O!d Testament,
which latier was all the world possessed
at one time. He spoke of the Bible as a
study in the history of antiquity, in polit
ical economy, in poetry, philology and
history.
These things, however, were not what it
really aimed to teach us. "Rather was
it so written," said the speaker, "to teach
us of the hope of a better land, where
there shall be no more misunderstanding,
no more sorrow, pain or sickness, and of
the master's outstretched hands. It tells
of a just God, who often tries us, but for
our own good. It teaches us faith througn
the story of Abraham's life and many
other lessons from the characters pictured
in it" Dr. Spading urged hia hearers
to read and stuoy it more and counseled
parents to familiarize their children with
its literary excellence and its unique code
of ethics.

"Lows" ;s us ally first appear on the Washington
roast. WhfnLthe pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along thÂ« coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high", in ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather â â  may be expected in * summer; and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
Will produce an opposite result. ;. Â-â¢

Physicians Want a Com
petent Steward at the
Hospital.
Prospective Harmony Among All
Elements Interested in
the Harbor.
Alameda County an Easy Place in
Which to Conceal an
Airship.
Oaki.anp Offick Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, December 6. f
In a few weeks' time a new Board of
Supervisors will take office and, as usual,
there will be a changp in all patronage at
the disposal of the board. While this
practice will invariably be followed so
long as public offices are not governed by
civil service rule, it is to be reeretted that
some changes will be made which cannot
be for the better and probably may be for
the worse. It is stated on good authority
that the new Supervisor who will have
the privilege of dispensing the patronage
of the Receiving Hospital will make an
entire change ;n that institution. Politics
can never add to the efficiency of a public
hospital, but can be worked so as to Very
seriously impair its efficiency. There is
danger that this will be done in this city.
Under its present management the Re
ceiving Hospital has been particularly free
from many of the Jitfle scandals and seri
ous mistakes that so often abound in simi
lar places.
The report has been made, and is undoubt
edly true, that the chief steward is soon
to be replaced with a man who is a total
stranger to the duties that will be re
quired of him. The person to whom this
responsible position will probably be
given is an undertaker, and many of tbe
leading physicians of the City have signed
a petition against any change being made
from the present conditions. No matter
what the doctors may want, it is very evi
dent that politics and not expediency will
dominate the appointment. But if an in
experienced man be placed in such a re
sponsible position as steward of a receiv
ing hospital in a railroad town where acci
dents are naturally numerous it is not im
possible tbat the county may find some
heavy damage suits on its hands. It is to
prevent any scandal of this kind that the
aoctors are working so earnestly.
The wharves ol Oakland at this particular
time present a very clear object lesson as
to the necessity of improving the harbor.
Two of the largest vessels that ever came
through the Golden Gate are now dis
charging in Oakland harbor. Vessels of
this size have never been above the bridges
before, and with the contract that has just
been let for the building of additional
wharve3 and coal bunkers will come an-in
crease of the demand for deeper water.
The conferences between the railroad
company and Supervisors during the past
. week have been very sati-factory to the
people of Oakland generally. Borne at
tempt has been made to misrepresent the '
conditions tbat exist, but there is always
an unreliable spasmodic element who are !
unabie to grasp the truth. This is decid- j
e.ily t.:e case in regard to the estuary.
There is no doubt that the county, the
railroad aha both tlie cities of Alameda
and Oakiand, as well as the electric road,
have legal rights individually, which all I
the others are bound to lespect, and the j
harmonizing of all their requirements can
only be done by intelligent conference. ;
This is now in progress, and there seems
to Le little doubt that all th6se interests, j
together with the requirements of the War j
Department, will result in the building of '
one large drawbridge, which will be a j
material improvement' over the two un
stable wooden obstacles that now span the
estuary.
Many of those who are skeptical re
garding the existence of the airship are j
irequently heard to remark that if .such a j
machine exists in this county it should |
be an easy matter to find it. Such people j
can surely have never been outside
of Oakland. In Alameda County
five hundred men could operate air
ships and be perfectly free from discov
ery except by accident. Only a few weeks I
ago an electric inventive genius was dis
covered on a remote ranch who had built
with t)is own hands and without any edu
cation enough electric machinery to oper
ate a dozen airships, and it was only by
accident that his apparatus was discov
ere <â¢ A few months ago a celebrated
bandit named Phil Crowley said good
jniorningtoa Sheriff near Haywards and
walked off into the hills. Many valuable
rewards were offered for his capture and
everybody who was out of work and who
imagined they had some detective ability
etarted out to hunt the bandit. At one !
time not less than two or three hundred!
men were scouring the hills of this county i
for a nvan who was reported as having
been teen a dozen times a day. The !
bandit was never found and the detectives j
gave up the hunt. In regard to the air- j
snip, about the existence of which many I
nre skeptical, no one has yet made a ays- i
temaiic mint. -and yet those who honestly
declare they have seen it are being i
taunted because they cannot find it.

Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
t>oÃ Broadway, Dec 6. )
The stage of the Macdonouph Theater
has been decorated op various occasions
wiih beautiful effect, but it has never pre
sented a more artistic appearance than
this afternoon, when the Oakland Lodge
or Elks held its annual memorial service.
At the back of tbe stage in an alcove
wa3 a sweetly toned pine organ, which
formed the background to the many nat
ural decorations. In the fore part of the
stage was a handsome white elk reclining
on a bank of natural greensward. On
either side were tall palms and ferns, and
near a small tombstone on which were the
words P. B. O. E., was a vacant chair. In
the space usually occupied by the orches
tra there was a veritable field of grass, over
which the white elk appeared to be keep
ing guard. The boxes were delicately
hung with streamers of smilax, and the
whole scene was in itself a tribute to the
artistic taste and decorative genius of the
Elks.
After the organ voluntary and the sing
ing of the Te Deum by the choir, Exalted
Ruler Macdonough formally opened the
ceremony. With her usual sweetness
Mrs. Beatrice Fine sang "Nearer, My God,
to Thee," after which the officers of the
lodge rendered the liturgy prepared for
the occasion. The Treble Clef Quartet
sang "The Lost Chord," after which
Field Officers of the Second Regiment, First California Brigade,
United Boys' Brigade of America.
George W. Reed rendered the eulogy,
"Tne ElKs."
.Benjamin Clark and H. A. Melvin ren
dered very impressively the duet "Cruci
fix," after which "The Visitation of the
Angels" was cleverly given by several
young ladies. Three oruhan sisters, Ruth,
Bessie and Blossom, represented respec
tively by Lulu Parrish, Jptsie Geary and
Ethel Kimble, knelt before the tombstone
on which was the word "Father." The
little mourners are represented as in a
dream, and while prostrate the voices of
the angels are heard in the wings. After
singing a verse the angels appear on the
scene, and after they ha I departed the lit
tle ones wake up mid congratulate each
other that they had heard voices from the
distant land whitt;er their fa'her had
gone. Tiio young ladies who took part in
this tableau were Miss Jessie Newman,
Pearl Hickman, Una McCloskey, Lilian
Geary, Irene Nesbit, lola Hawley, Ruby
Btin.son, Edith Hubbard, Maud Newhard,
Glady Beran, Grace Reev s. Hilma But
ler, Alda Casey, Flossie Luke, Hatiie Sav

ist was M ss Emma B. Wells.
"Oh, Es'Â«Â» That Are Weary" was sung
by the Temple Male Quartet, and w:-s fol
lowed by Henry A. Melvin's eulogy, "In
Memonam."
The douole quariet sang "The Lord Is
Mv Shepherd." and after the closing cere
monies by the lodire Chaplain James Tay
lor pronounced the benediction.

A HaywanN Lady May Die as the Re
sult of an Accident.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec 6.-Mrs. W. Bel
lina is lying at tne point of death as tbe
result of injuries received in a peculiar
manner last Friday.
Some lads were playing football .near
Strobel & Neudick's place, at Haywards,
when the ball was kicked over the high
fence. The lads jumped over the fence to
recover their ball. In doing so they
caused the fence to collapse. It wax about
seven feet high and thirty feet long, and
the whole structure fell down.
Mrs. Bellina was walking past the fence
at the time of the nccident, ana it fell
upon her. She is about 50 years of age,
and for several hours after the accident
she was unconscious. She has been re
moved from the house to which she was
taken to her own home, but her injuries
are very serious and the doctors give oat
little hope of her ultimate recovery.

A FOOTBALL QUESTION.
A Plan Suggested by Professor George
C. Edwards to Pur the Game
on a Sound Basis.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 6.â A matter of
vital importance and far-reaching in its
effect upon football affairs at tbe State
University wili be considered during the
coming week by the student body. Colo
nel George C. Edwards, who has always
been one of the foremost promoters of
athletics at the university, has suggested
that an executive committee consisting of
three membersâ the director of physical
culture, the coach and an alumnusâ shall
be appointed to have complete charge of
football affairs, so far as training and
preparation for the great annual game ia
concerned. He does not believe that an
advisory board, such as has existed in the
past, is of any use whatsoever, and that to
be of service a committee must have power
to act. He says tbat such a committee
would frame a consistent policy, und
could see that it was carried out. Such a
committee would be a repository of infor
mation and experience; it would not be
too large to be effective, and could be
trusted.
This suggestion on the part of Colonel
Edwards is the outgrowth of a long-felt
need for such a committae. Heretofore
tbe management and direction of football
affairs at the university have been con
ducted on more or less loosely organized
lines, and it is for tbe establishment of a
definite head that the professor has begun
this campaign. It is his purpose to set
football affairs at Berkeley on a basis
similar to tnat at Harvard, Yale and
other large Eastern universities, where
men are appoiuted witii power to outline
and to carry on the work of the entire
season.
Fainted While Slnclng.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 6.â Tenor Solo
ist R. F. Harris oi the Presbyterian church,
while rendering a selection at the opening
service this morning, va- taken witti a
fainting spell and would have fallen pros
trate had it not been for the prompt action
of his feilow-ctioristers. He lapsed into a
swoon, and it was some moments before
he revived. Quite a ;cene followed his
collapse. Tlie audience detected a tremor
in his voice when he arose to render his
solo, but little thought that he would faint
away. It was not a case of stage fright,
because the young man is accustomed to
appearing in public. He had been unwell
for a number of days, and in attempting
to carry on his part his strength failed.

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Increased Inquiry for All
Classes ot City Prop
erty.
Benefic al Results of Improve
ment Clubs on Realty
Interests.
The Total Number of Sales for Novem
ber According to Magee's Circular
Amounted to $742,561.
A steady improvement is reported in the
real estate market by all the leading brokers
in the business. There is an increasing in
quiry for all elnsses of City property, and the
only check to business is a difference in ideas
as regards price between seller and buyer.
Owners, secure in their position, with the
restoration of confidence in all other lines of
trade, are not disposed to concede anything to
close transactions, which hang fire in conse
quence.
The drift of the inquiry still continues
toward the smaller-priced residence lots for
improvement purposes. There is not a great
quantity of the larger class of income prop
erty being offered, and any that is at moder- j
ate price is soon picked up. This, with the
amount of idle money accumulating in the
savings institutions, creates a demand lor de-
Bil able vacant land which can well be im
proved with a prospect lor fair returns upon
the capital expended.
If, as has been said, "speculation in real
estate has its ebb and flow like the ever re
curring tide," brokers may certainly expect a
swell before long. Though slow in some re
spects, San Francisco can boast of the energy
shown by its real estate dealers, many of
whom have been prime movers the past year
in needed improvement enterprises.
In this City they have organized improve
ment CUbs which have acted as leaders in the
development of the suburbs and been the
champions ot several measures of municipal
reform.
A number of the most influential men have
giveu their support to financial enterprises of
the interior of the State, which will eventually
help San Francisco; the financial center of the
coast. Improvements in City, suburbs and
country go hand in hand, all tending to build
up a great commonwealth and a great city,
and no class has* worked with more unity of
action or fidelity of purpose the past season
than the real estate brokers.
The following is taken from the Real Estate
Circular of Tnomas Magee & Sons :
"We have to report a decidedly improved
condition of the real estate market. There is
more inquiry and more sales, and a feeling on
the part oi ow.ners that, if they cannot ad
vance their prices, they should at least not
take any less than existing low rates. Buyers
seem to leel that though ihere has not yet been |
any increase of prices, there will be no further
decline la thu prices of any kind of even me
dium property, and that therefore the time
for them to buy has probably come. So far,
properties worth $2000 to $10,000 have been
in most aemand. Large buyers have not yet
entered the field for the very best class of busi
ness properties, and indeed there is now, as
there has been all through the past six and a
half year's dullness, very few of the largest
and choicest inside properties for sale. The
outlook on the whole Is very encouraging, be
cause confidence has returned; without that,
of course, no business can move. The total
nutnbef of sales last month was 211, of the
value of $742,561.
"The'savings banks of the City granted 157
city lonns in November of the total value of
$205,070, against 71 City loans in October of
the total value oi $309,890. The Hibernia I
Bank continues to grant nli City loans at o}-,
per cent, it paying the mortgage tax; the
other banks charge 7. The demand for real
estate being as yet only moderate the demand
for money is not large.
"For something more than three months
preceding the election there was a steady and i
constant draw on the pavings banks, the with- j
drawals by the depositors largely exceeding
the amounts deposited. To meet this drain '
recourse was had to the reserves oi the insti- j
tutions, which of course were sensibly reduced !
uuder the pressure. Siuce the 3J ot Kovem- i
ber there has been a steady gain in deposits, j
but from the incoming moneys the banks have
deemed it prudent to restore the reserves.
They have had. also to pay tne first install
ment of taxes and it has been and is in order
to make preparation for the payment of the
January dividend. With these uses for money
the supply available for loans on real estate
has been limited and will probably so con
tinue until the dividends mentioned b aye beeu
paid."

New Deep Sea Life.
One of the incidents of the recent deep
sea aredging expedition of the Prince of
Monaco most fruitful in scientific results
was the capture of a sperm whale. It oc
curring to the Prince that the food collec
tions of the animal's stomach might in
clude specimens of creatures still unknown,
tbe ship was held near the whale till tie
died. In his convulsions he tnrew np a
mass of fragments of very curious cepha
lopods, wnicli were beginning to float
away and be scattered and be lost to sci
ence, when the snip's screw was reversed
to create a counter current, under the ad
vantage of which specimens of two en
tirely new species, different from any
hitherto known, were recovered. The body
of one was covered with scales ana was
more than ninety centimeters long. The
other had a crown of tentacle-, armed with
suckers bearing claws like those of the
larger birds of prey.
Birdcage "Walk in St. James Park, Lon
don, was so called from Charles IPs aviar
ies, which were situated along its southern
sido.

NATIONAL GUARD OF CALIFORNIA
During the month of December the Na- j
tional Guard is excused from the duty of j
drilling. When the various companies j
and battalions shall respond to drill duty
next month the revised infantry drill reg
ulations of the United States army will be
available, and the instructions will be in
accordance with the new tactics. It has
taken the War Department a long time |
to get the revised regulations in a form j
acceptable to all the experts, hence it is !
presumed that the new tactics have come j
to stay until some operations of actual j
conflict render further changes necessary.
Adjutant-General Barreti left California
tor Washington last Thursday evening.
He has gone East to attend v meeting of
the Board of Managers oi the Home for
Disabled Volunteers. General Barrett j
represents the branch institution at Santa j
Monica on the National Board of Man
agers. The notion is entertained by crit
ic of the Nat onal Guard thai tue State
of California pays the expenses of the
adjutant-general on his annual trips to
Washington.
The fact is the State pays no part of the
expense of his trip. The appropriation
for the maintenance of the National Guard
allows a very small sum for traveling and
incidental expense*. Captain Carrington
of the United States army, who i* on duty .
as inspector of the guard, is frequently j
obliged to make orneial trips in the line of j
his duty, and to pay from his own pocket j
the greater part of hotel and road ex- j
penses of the journeys.
A meeting of the executive committee of
the National Guard Officers' Association
was held recently at tne office of the presi- I
dent. General Dickinson. There were I
present Generals John H. Dickinson, It. ;
H. Warrield, M. \V. Mailer ant Colonels !
Fairbanks, Currier, Bush, Wriaht and j
Duboce, representing the National Guard i
Â«.t tins State, with the exception of the |
Fim Brigiule, General Last being absent.
Alter considerable discussion it was de
cided tocontinu â¢ the organization through
its executive committee, which consists of
the officers of the association, the major- (
general, brigadier-generals, regimental |
commanders and commander oi the Naval
Battalion. The report of the treasurer
was rpad. showing a balance on hand of
$17; i So, which v.as received and accepted
and ordered on file.
General Dickinson tendered his resigna
tion as president of the association, which
â¢ was accepted, and a committee consisting
of Colonel Currier and Colonel BusU was
appointed to draft and present suitable
resolutions expressive of their regret, of
such resignation, and a recognition of his
as such since its organization in j
An election of officers was then held for
the ensuing year. General N. T. James
was elected president; Generals K. H.
. Warf:el<i, M. W. Muller and C. F. A. Last
â were chosen vice-ores^rients; Colonel, H.
P. Bush, treasurer; Qolonel J. C. Currier,
secretary, and Lieutenant-Colonel J. C.
Giesting, assistant secretary.
The meeting then adjourned, subject to
the call of the president. In the mean
time the several brigade associations were
requested to hold meetings and submit to
the executive comniit:ee such propositions
as they may deem proper to be embodied
in the bill to be presented to the Legisla
ture at its coming session, such meetings J
to be held at as early a date us possible, so
.as to enable the executive committee to
properly prepare the measures which may
be brought before them. The headquar
ters of the association in future will oe at
the office of the secretary, 320 Sansome

The National Guard officers will ask the
Legislature to make an allowance of $70,- j
000 or $80,000 for encampment expenses of
the next two years. - On this subject Gov- !
ernor Uuiid, as commander-:n-chie [ , may
embody some recommendation in the
measure to the Legislature.
Should the amount be allowed Captain
Carrington will recommend regimental
encampments. Observation has convinced
him that the best results are attained by
regiments going into camp lor a week or
loneer, and performing Ml the duties of a
small force in the field. The encampment
by division presents too many feature-! of ;
a big picnic, besides the troops do not re
_ quire instruction in brigade and division
1 evolutions. The . New York plan of a
State camping-ground, where each regi
. ment ' may encamp for one week is re
parded as good, and one that might be
adapted in California with positive bene
fit to the service.
It is acknowledged (by r.Il observers that
a regiment organized for example like the
Fifth Infantry (Colonel Fairbanks), with
companies stationed- respectively in Oak
land, Alameda. Sin Jose, San Rafael. Pet
aJnma, Santa Rosa and Nap a, should have
n regimental encampment every year.
Battalion instruction demands this con
centration. What applies in this respect
. to the Fifth applies equally. to the Second,
the Sixth and the Seventh. '
Opinions differ as to the relative value
of regimental,! brigade and division en
campments. ; Soldiers the equal of Cap
tain Carrington in years of service and
intelligence believe that a ; division" en
campment of the National Guard of Cali
fornia in the Presidio wouia be highly in
structive and beneficial to the troops of
the State. Th* fiict is also rrc-illed that
the last big encampment- at Santa Cruz
cjlled out much regimental rivalry.
Colonel Shafter's, First infantry, U.S.
A., marched from San Francisco to Santa
Cruz and , went into camp on the same
â¢ lield alongside of the Guard regiments.
National Guardsmen of the First, Second,
Third, Fifth. Sixih and Eighth regiments

bearing of i lie ; regular \s>ol<liers. rAn en

FO R THAT TUG-OF-WAR,
The Captains of the Twelve
Contesting Teams Mest
and Arrange It.
How the Contest Is to Be Conducted.
A Plan to Keep the Teatus
From Outsiders.
Last evening a dinner was given by the
management of the Sutro Baths at the
Cliff House to the twelve captains of the
tug-of-war teams that are to engage in the
International 'lug-of-war, to commence
on Sunday next at the baths.
There were present: Joseph Merani of
the Italian team, Alfred Bourquin of the
Portuguese team, Georice Duplissea of the
Canadian team, Peter Buckley of the
American team, A. M. Planck of ti:e
Swedish team, J. C. Johnson of the Nor
wegian team, Neils Andersen of the
Danish team. C. Waller of the German j
team, M. L. i"ancovich of the Slavonian
team, J. W. Hardnedy of the Irish team,
M. Campbell of the Scotch team and Fred
Fro*t of the English team.
The others who were present were:
Colonel William C. Little, W. R. H. Adam
son, C W. Freese, T. H. Van Frank
diaries W. Sut.ro, Thomas Nolan, M.
Clawson and J. C. baxton, and late in the
evening Mayor Sutro put in an appear
ance.
After justice had beerf done to the cood
things laid before them there was a gen
eral discussion of the manner in which
the tug should be conducted, and each of
the captains expressed the opinion that
it should be conducted in such & manner
that no one tould cry out "take" or "put
up job.' 1
They seemed to be of the one opinion
that this sport could be made a legitimate
one and that there was no reason why a
tug-of-war association should not be or
ganized as soon as the coming contest
shall have been determined.
J. C. Saxton, who has the general super
vision of getting the teams in onler,
stated that when all is ready just before
the tug commences every evening and
afternoon cau. i team shall be taken into a
separate room and the memberd dressed
lor the fray.
Tuat just before they were to appear on
the platform the management should
announce to each what team it would have
to pull against and then keep them away
from all outÂ«ders. so that no one could
talk to or influence them in any manner.
To this all the captains expressed them
selves as agreeable.
The statement was made that a platform
12) feet lonz has been built over the small
tanks sufficiently high to prevent any out
sider from touching the cleats, and that it
was so located that every one in the build
ing would have a full view of the contest
ants from the galleries.
Mr. Saxton stated that he would dace a
device of bis own invention on the plat
form which would act automatically when
one team had drawn the other over the j
five line mark, and that it would pro- |
Claim the winner by means of a nag
designating the nationality.
The matter of selecting a referee occu
pied some time, but no choice was
definitely reached. The office, however,
will be offered to William Greer Harrison
and Billy Jordan. A suggestion to call
in Wyatt Kar;i with His little pistol was
received in silence.
The following were announced as the
teams that had been selected:
Americaâ Peter Buckley (captain), Thomas
Nolan, Frank Martreli, Frank Shade, J. Jack
son, J. Mannin.fr Hnd Thomas Cnssidy.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1896.
SOCIALISTS ARE
STILL ACTIVE
Laying Out the Work for
Organizing the
State.
Branches of the Party Will Be
Established in Every
Town.
Will Soon Resume the Strest Lectures
in This City-Sunday Even-.
irg Address s.
Since the recent election the members of
the Socialist Labor party have been talc
ing matters easy, waiting for the excite
ment of the campaign to abate before
beginning active operations again. From
now on the work of spreading the doc
trines of socialism will be taken up and
pushed with renewed vigor. 'Ihe fact,
that at the last election the Sjcialist La
bor party received over 3 per cent of the
votes cast in the City, tnus giving the
party recognition as such at ihe next elec
tion, has caused great rejoicing in the
ranks.
Although the smoke of the battle has
scarcely passed away, the leaders are pre
paring for the next political battle. Their
plan and purpose is to increase the num
ber of Socialists in the City and Estate to
such a number that the power of the party
will be felt more on the next occasion
than on the last. To this end a Socialist
Labor party wagon in charge of a deputy
State organizer will soon be started out
into the country. Socialist lectures will
be held in nearly every city and town in
California where no organization has
been established, and the deputy will or- I
ganize branches wnerever he finds the
seed* have taken root. Literature on
matters of social and political economy
will be freely distributed.
In this City street meetings will soon be
instituted, notwithstanding that the So
cialists expect trouble from the authori
ties.
The American branch of the San Fran
cisco section has arranged for a series of
interesting lectures lasting until March.
Among the speakers secured are several
prominent in the sciences and literature.
The Lelanu Sianiord Jr. University will
contribute a number of these.
Following is the programme of lectures
to be delivered in Pythian Cattle, 909
Market street:

liain; Fe'o. 21â "The Progress of Poverty," C.

Like to Know," E. T. Kiugsley.
The first was delivered lost evening in
Pythian Castle to a large ana appreciative
audience. Miss Jane A. Roulston pre
sided. The meeting was opeuod by singing
the "Marseillaise," followed by a solo by
Mi^s Martha Aspden. George Aspden
read a couching poem by the late socialist,
poet, critic and artist, William Morris of
England, entitled "Message of the March
Wimi." The speaker ol the evening whs
Prolessor W. 11. Hudson oJ the Leland
titanlord Jr. University, whose subject was
"William Moi ris.'
Professor Hudson was well acquainted
with the great English socialist, and he
paid a touching tribute to the memory of
the great man. After dealing wuh the
personality of the man Professor Hudson
said that the English socialist was once
asVed the question how he became a
socialist, to which Morris replied: "By
noticing how ugly the modern worl.i is.
Capitalism has plunged tbe world into a
sordid morass of ugiine.-s."
Alter the lecture several other speakers
took the rostrum for a few minutes.
QUESTION OF SANITY.
Frederick W. Reiner of San Rafael to
Be Examined by the Commis
sioners To-Day.
Frederick W. Reiner, the commission
merchant irom San Rafael, who appeared
in Judge Campbell's court Wednesday to
answer a charge of exhibiting a deadly
weapon and next morning was ordered to
be sent before the Insanity Commissioners
to be examined, will appear before the
Commissioners this morning.
Reiner's case is a peculiar one. He
came to this City on November 24 and
registered at the Golden West Hotel.
That night he visited the Midway Piais
ance and became infatuated with two of
the girls there, Viola Le Page and Ida
Bly the. He spent a lot of money for wine
and took the two girls to supper. Next
morning he informed the police that one
of the girls, Ida Biythe, had robbed him
of $160.
That afternoon he went to the room of
Viola Le Page at 25 Grant avenue, and
demanded to know where Ida Blythe's
room was, as he believed she had robbed
him. Sl.e declined to tell him and he
pulled out a revolver and threatened to
kill her.
In Judge Campbell's court he conducted
himselt in such a manner that the Judge
was compelled to believe that he whs not
in his right mind, hence his detention till
he is examined by the liuanity Commis
sioners.
Reiner had, it is said, $1000 when he
came here on November :M, and in a few
days no managed to squander it. He was
at one time an officer in a German cavalry
regiment, and came to this country six
teen years ago. He was in business in
New York, Denver and Stockton, and for
the past two months has been living in
San Rafael. He belongs to Stuttgart,
Germany, and, it is said, his mother died
recently, leaving him a fortune of $250,
-000, which he intended going to Germany
to get possession of.
IS HE A CRIMINAL?

reply to tbe di-patch he sent Saturday to
the Chief of Police of Omaha, asking for
information about Ralph Duncan.
Duncan is the man who on Saturday
made a statement to Jus ice of the Peace
Barry that he had committed a crime, and
as lie :elt like committing a greater crime,

GEORGE W. WADE
TRIED SUICIDE
The Assistant Secretary of
the School Board in
Trouble.
He Was Suspended Pending an
Investigation Into Irregu
lar Acts.
Found by a Friend He Was Taken
Home Last Night in a Dazed
and Low Csndiiion.
The mystery with which George W.
"Wade, assistant secretary of the Board of
Education, has enveloped his queer ac
tions of the past few days was in a meas
ure cleared away yesterday afternoon
â¢when tie returned dazed and asked to see
his family.
His return was a great relief to his wife,
who had almost mourned him dead since
Saturday morning, when Mrs. Wade re
ceived a letter in which he bade her gooii
by and threatened to commit suicide.
Wade twice attempted in his absencs
from home to carry his threat into execu
tion, but either by the intervention of
people about him or errors in preparation
he was not successful. Now, however, he
will be cioseiy watched lest a third at
tempt be made. It wiil be some time,
though, before Wade's condition is such
that he can be examined by the Board of
Education in connection with irregular
acts for which he was suspended by Henry j
T. Scott, president of the board. Mean- i
while the greatest curiosity exists among |
public school teachers and acquaintances
ot Wade as to now he had fallen to pieces
all of a sudden.
For W:ide was popularly supposed to be
a quiet, sensible ;eliow, with no expensive
habits, ana how he could have borrowed
something like $2000 and spent it, in addi
tion to a salary of $175 a month, while
living modestly remains to be explained.
Tuesday last Wade took sick and had to
go to bed. His health seemed utterly
shattered. Dr. McXutT was called in next
day. and he gave instructions to keep the
patient quiet, as it was apparent to him
that Wade had 90m 0 nervous mental de
rangement in addition to a severe attack I
of Bright's disease. Thursday morning
Mrs. Wade was surprised to find him iv
the hall ready to go out. "You must not
leave the house against the doctor's or
ders," she urged.
"Oh, that will be all right," he replied, j
with an air of unconcern. "I've some I
very important business down at the hall |
and will be back in an hour."
So Wade left his home at Jackson and ,
Jones streets, and, to all intents, disap
peared. The wife, as time wore on, be
came distracted, but no friend could bring
her aniy comfort.
Friday passed without a word from the
missing man, but next niornine brought
the letter with the threat of suicide. This,
with the fact that he paid up his dues in
the Legion of Honor Friday night to cover
a death certificate was taken as conclusive
that.Wade contemplated taking his life.
A search was instituted at once here and !
in Oakland, and yesterday the description j
of Wade was read to the policemen going }
out on duty.
Toward evening W. H. Hajght of 402
Geary street, a friend of the missing man, j
notified Wndes friends that he had been !
found, and soon after "Wade was tnken j
home by his brother-in-law. He was so !
weak that he could not undress and the |
family physician was summoned. The I
doctor remained some time wi'h his
patient and refused to let anyone but Mrs.
Wade enter the room. He stated that
Wade's condition was serious and it de
manded extreme care to effect a cure.
"I found him on Geary street, between
Mason and Powell, tins afternoon," said
Haight. "He was walking toward Powell
street and looked iike he had been drink
ing. I learned to-day that he was rniss
in<:, and started out to find him. I knew
where to find him. He could not give an
account ot himself. Then I took him to
my room and held him here till his '
brother-in-law took him home. He at- I
tempted to commit suicide twice by as
phyxiation, but the gas was too weak."
Haight would not say where Wade tried
to die. though he admitted it was in a
lodjting-dotise. The supposition is that
Wade was among some ot his downtown
friends nnd 'hey paved his life and at last
prevailed on him to go home. He spent
some time in the house at 402 Geary street,
the landlady of which said that he bad j
been brought over from Oakland yester- I
day.
Two orders signed by Wade |for his
salary warrant for November were pre- I
sented Saturday to the secretary of the ]
Board of Education by different brokers.
The orders were returned, as the demand
had been handed to another broker. They
were taken up. however, by a friend.
Besides, it was charged that Wade had
borrowed freely from school teachers.
President Scott of the board made an in
vestigation which resulted in the assistant j
secretary's suspension.
Secretary Beanston said that Wade's !
books were correct, and friends of the sus
pended assistant secretary asserted that
there was positively nothing wrong in a
legal sense. Only Wade had allowed him
self to become involved financially and bor
rowed nearly $2000. This debt, coupled
with the fear that the new Democratic j
Board of Education might remove him to
give a Democrat the position, is said to
have so preyed upon Wade's mind that
the troubles turned his head.

EXAMPLE TO BE MADE
The South San Francisco Gun Club's
Traps Raided by the S. P. C. A.
Yesterday.
The Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals gave another practical
demonstration yesterday of the fact that
it is something more than ornamental.
One result of this demonstration is that
William Fanning, a member of the South
San Francisco Gun Club, will have to an
swer to a double charge in the Police
Court this morning.
Charles Holbrook, a prominent officer
of the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals, accompanied by five oth
ers, went to the Five-Mile House. South
San Francisco, yesterday afternoon,
where the South San Francisco Gun Club,
an organization composed of enthusiastic
sporting characters, was joldine a clay
pigeon shoot. Later in the day, however,
a sack was produced containing a dozen
bona fide pigeons, two of which were al
ready dead â evidently smothered â while
the remainder were in a horrible condi
tion.
William Fanning, a member of the club,
was preparing to shoot the birds when
Officer Cochrane, one of Mr. Holbrook's
companions, interfered to prevent him,
and in doing so narrowly escaped receiv- j
ins; the charge of shot intended for the |
I birds in h'.s head. Fanning was not al- I
lowed to lire another shot, but was atonce
arrested and to "base durance and conta
gious prison" conveyed with all possible |
dispaUh â or in other words, to the South- j
em Police station, where two charees j
were booked against his name, viz.,
cruelty to animals and the shooting of
live pigeons within the County limits
The fir-t charge is justified by the fact
that two of the birds, as previously stated,
died from suffocation. Fanning was re
leased on furnishing bail to the amount of
$40â 520 for either charge.
FOUL PLAY SUSPECTED,
Patrick Driscoll of the Opinion
That Daniel Shea Was
Murdered
The Dead Man's Body Found Floating
iv the Bayâ Police Sc ff at
the Theory.
Patrick Driscoll, 420 Clementina street
reported to the Coioner yesterday that he
believed his nephew, Daniel Shea, who
was found drowned near the Fourth-street
bridge Friday afternoon, had met with
foul play.
Driscoll based his suspicions upon the
fact that there was a long deep cut on the
dead man's forehead, he thought his
nephew had probably been struck on the
fore head with some instrument, then
iob bed and thrown into the water.
Shea belongs to Mendocino County, and
came here on a visit two or three weeks
ago. He stopped at the Cosmopolitan
Hotel on Mission and Fifth streets for a
few days, but left on November 23. Since
then very little is known about his move
ments.
Toe body is now in an undertaker's
establishment on Fifth street, but will not
be interred till an investigation is made
as to the nature of the wound on the fore
head.
The Coroner notified the Tpolice of Dris
coll's suspicions of foul play, and De
tectives Dillon and Crockett were detailed
on the case.
So far the thaory of foul play does not
seem to be supported. It is supposed that
the wound on the forehead was caused by
Shea striking against one of the piles of
the bridge when he fell into the water,
the police theory being that he had been
drinking and fell off "the bridge in the
darkness. The detectives also learned
that the last time he was seen alive he
borrowed a quarter from a friend.
Detective Dillon, after making a
thorough investigation of the case, has
reachtd a conclusion that Shea's death
was due solely to accident, and he will so
report to Captain Lees.
"The drowned man had been drinking
heaviiv during his stay in my hotel," said
William Faliey, proprietor of the Cosmo
politan, last evening.
"When Shea was intoxicated," he con
tinued, "he lost all control of himself. He
would fall down without provocation or
cause and at any place and would wander
around in search of his room and would
sometimes get into the wrong one. He
was keeping company with a young lady,
Miss Reilly, who resides on Illinois street.
He frequently called on her and would
return, over the Fourth-street bridce, to
tha hotel late at night. Considering these
facts I am confident that Shea was on his
way to Miss Keilly's home when he be
came bewildered in the darkness and fell
ovtr the bridge."
An examination of the wounds on the
body disclosed the fact that the skull was
slightly fractured over the left eye. It was
not a fracture as would be produced
by a slungshot or club, however, and the
autopsy physician is of the opinion that
ihe wound was caused by the body strik
ing against a pile while floating in the
water.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1896.
INTO AN EQUINE
AMPHITHEATER
The Mechanics' Pavilion
Has Been Completely
Transformed.
Workmen Toiled Through the
Sabbath Day for the Horse
Show.
Boxes Will Be Lower Than Before
and the Fair Occupants Cjn
Talk to Promenaders.
There was no rest yesterday for the men
who are making all the necessary prepara
tions for the horse show, which will open
Wednesday in the Mechanics' Pavilion.
The management has gone into the work
this year with a determination to make
I the show a grand success, not alone in the
' style and variety of Mock exhibited, but
] also in its numerous appointments, and
I having done so, no detail is let pass with
out receiving its due share of attention.
This concern for the coming exhibition
was apparent yesterday iv the Pavilion,
where a crowd of mechanics and laborers
were busy from morning until night, set
ting the place in readiness for the grand
I event.
The large interior has undergone a sur
prising change since the prize-fight took
place, and instead of rows upon rows of
chairs surrounding a roped arena, the
scene yesterday in the Pavilion was sug
gestive of an amphitheater in course of
construction, with a spacious oval or
"ring" in the middle, and here and there a
group of workmen. The clatterof hammer
and saw mingled with the cries of team
sters to their horses and words of instruc
tion from the men superintending the dif
ferent departments of construction.
This year the ring fence is back almost
on aline with the gallery balustrades, and
it is built with double rsilinps, evidently
to stand the severest shock that may be
given. Outside is the usual promenade,
extending clear around the oval. Here
the male element of society, in evening
dress or horsey costumes and smiles, will
parade before the gentler sex in the
Doxes, and here, too, the fashionable
world of San Francisco will hold an open
reception for the horse show season.
There will be an agreeabie surprise for
I the swell set, or for all these who will
| occupy boxes and do the promenade, for
on this occasion the boxÂ«s are much lower
than at the former shows. So the ladies
sliall not be compelled to look down upon
their friends and hold conversations under
difficulties with the gentlemen on the
floor. Under the new arrangement a man
standing in the circular walk will be on
an equal height with ladles and their es
corts in the boxesâ a really nice thing for
all concerned.
There seems to be another consideration
for lowering the height of the boxes,
which was explained yesterday by the
superintendent.
"You know," said he, "large hats are
fashionable this year, and for that reason j
the ladies will all be out in the largest
hats. That is why the boxes are low
down. It was necessary to make the con
ceÃsion, especially as the people in the
reserved seats behind the boxes would
want to see the ring. But there will be no
difficulty on that score, because the tiers
of in back are raised higher than
usual and everybody can have a good,
unobstructed view of the ring."
The boxes extend along two Bides of the
ring and are continued around the western
end, between the gates or entrance and
exit to the enclosure. The east end is oc
cupied by a gallery and the grand stand,
which is also divided into private boxes.
One of G. A. Pope f s Favorite Horses That Is Expected to
Create a Sensation at the Coming Horse Show.
Nearly all these compartments were fin
ishpd yesterday, except for the tops of the
dividme rails. In the rear the rows of
! reserved seats were up reaching backward
', from the floor of the boxstails to the
gallery ceiling along the sides.
The rine floor, it is believed, will be as
fine a one this season as the most exacting
horseman could desire. Its foundation
gave evidence of that expectation. First
of all a floor of stout timber was laid upon
the Pavilion boards and several hundred
cartloads of yellow clay were spread upon
it Saturday and yesterday. This clny was
carted from the neighborhood of the" Ger
man Hospital, having been selected for its
peculiar elastc quality. When spread
yesterday it was fully six inches deep, ris
ing to twelve inches around the rails. To
pack it into a solid, springy mass a pon
derous iron roller was hauled over it by
two horses all day long. This rolling will
be continued to-day, and when the surface
ia as even as a floor of bituminous rock
about two or ttiree inches of tanbark will
be scattered over it and rolled firmly.
Then the ring will be ready for the equine
exhibition of jumping, running, riding,
etc.
While the ring and seating arrangement
have been put into shape, accommoda
tions for the aristocratic steeds of ail de
grees have not been forgotten. On the
contrary, the wings and annexes and
other outside portions of the big building
have been turned into a series of immense
staoles. On every side are rows of stalls,
many of them provided with air-tight lin
ing and doors, and wherever a draft was
suspected it has been blocked with parti
tions.
Those stalls have already been reserved
by exhibitors, and were in readiness yes
terday to receive their occupants. To-day
fodder and food will be moved into these
stalls, and also the first lot of horse
trappings, livery and vehicles, so lhat the
place will have everything needed lor the
horses on their arrival.
Captain Thomson and six of his men
will enter the contest at the horse show
for horsemanship. Besides the captain
there will be Officers Compiler, Harper,
Arellanes, Norlin, Dow and Kavanagh.
In addition to norse man snip they will
enter in a contest for lariat-throwing.
The captain will display his silver-mounted
saddle, which was awarded the first prize
at the Columbian World's Fair and at the
Milwaukee Fair.
CHINATOWN BATTLE.
Sabbath Amusement Over the Sale of
a Chinese Laundry Where the
Iron Bar Figured.
The highbinders of the Wong and the
Lee families held a pitched battle on
Washington street, between Dupont and
Stockton, yesterdav afternoon, at which
Lee Hing, a vicious-looking highbinder,
wielded an iron bar with pood effect over
the head of Ah Yee, inflicting several
scalp wounds, which had the effect of
slitting tiie cranium of Yee as though he
were a chopping-block.
A commotion in front of the store 842
Washington street attracted the attention
of Officers. V. Bonuer, who was on duty
at Dtipont and Washington streets.
On his arrival at the place he observed a
general Ditched battle going on in the
store. He blew his whistle, which
brought Sergeant Mooney's posÂ«e to the
scene. Oilicer Martin F. Faunian, who
was in charpe of the ?quad in the absence
of Sergeant Mooney, blockaded the exits
and bagged twenty-three full-fledged high
binders.
The patrol wagon was called into requis
ition and carted the entire lot to the Cali- I
fornia- street station, where charges were
preferred against them of disturbing the
peace except Lee Hmg, who was charged
with an assault with a deadly weapon.
He was identified by Ah Lee as the one
who wielded the iron bar with such great
effect.
The cause of tl e Sunday row arose over
the sale of a lanndryat 1409 Devisadero
I street, which had lately cluinged hands
and in the transfer one of the laundry
hands claimed he was being cheated out
of $57 due him.
It was in the attempt to collect this
amount that the row took place between
the members of the See Yip and the
Wong Yee companies. The latter gang
belonging to the Wong family undertook
to clean out the See Yips, but the timely
interference of the officers saved the Cor
oner from a job.
Immediately preceding this fight Ah
Ming was founa on the street with a 44
caliber Colt's revolver stowed away in his
blouse. He was arrested and bailed out
just as the row was goirii; on.
DECLARES AGAINST
CONVICT GOODS
The Labor Convention Is
Very Decided on the
Subject.
Will Try to Obtain Appropri
ate Legislation Favoring
Its Views.
Delegates From an Unemp'oyed Meet
ing Fail to Obtain Admittance
to the Gathering.
Delegates from the trades unions of the
City met yesterday in the California Labor
Convention Hall, 915>Â£ Market street,
under the instructions of the convention
for the purpose of discussing as a central
labor body questions of vital importance
to all the unions.
The meeting was called to order by
President James Rose, and Recording
Secretary Guy Lathrop read the creden
tials of the delegates from the following
organizations: Labor Council, Pattern
and Model Maker-, United Green-glass
Workers' Association, Coast Seamen's
Union, Alameda Federation of Trades,
Cigar-makers' Union, International Furni
ture-workers, Iron-molders' Union, Bar
bers' Local Union, Typographical Union,
Journeymen Plumbers, Gas and Steam
Fitters and Bricklayers' Union.
The credentials of a delegation from the
unemployed now meeting at 1159 Mission
street created considerable warm discus
sion. Objection was made regarding the
admission of these representatives on the
ground that the body from wnich they
came did not represent organized labor.
President Kose said he had just come
from the meeting at 1159 Mission street
and he hail heard sentiments uttered at
that gathering such as no trade union
could for a moment advocate. They had
unanimously adopted a motion, he said,
to send a committee to all employers in
the City and request to be given work be
low union rates.
Andrew Furuseth of the Coast Seamen's
Union called attention to the communica
tion bearing the signature of John N. Lee,
chairman of the ways and means commit
tee, asking tnat tne labor convention send
a delegation to 1159 Mission street, etc.,
and he wanted to know who John N. Lee
was, that the organized laborers of San
Francisco should wait on him. He would
advise that these unemployed get into
their unions and organize into bodies that
could be recognized. These floating bodies
of laborers were a menace to organized la-
Dor everywhere and at all times.
It was finally concluded by ihe conven
tion not to admit the delegates, and the
committee on credentials so informed
them in the anteroom.
After the rpading of the minutes the
subject of prison labor was taken up, aiut
the report of the committee having that
matter in hand considered.
Secretary Lathrop stated that he had
attended a meeting of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association when the con
vict-labor question had been discussed.
At that meeting the following draft of a
bill to be presented to the next Legisla
ture was offered :
Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any per
son confined or employed iv any penalinstitu
tion in the State of California to engage or be
employed iv the manufacture of auything
whatever that is an article of comnu-rce except
jute 'oags and jute cloth (and articles made of
natural stone.)
Sec. 2. This act will not apply to the manu
facture of any p.rticle consumed in the penal
institution where manufactured.
Secretary Lathrop explained that the
words "and articles made of natural
stone," were in effect left out at his
earnest request. He also said that he
thought that the association was inclined
to favor prison-dressed stone.
Several proposed amendraonts from
Code Commissioner Shields were read and
referred to the proper committee, one
regarding the imposing o! licenses upon
persons soliciting for articles produced or
manufactured in this Slate; another
regarding the placine of labels upon
prison-made goods and a heavy penalty of
fine or imprisonment for the "removal of
said signs or labels.
The convention indoised the anti
prison-labor bill of Representative South
wick now pending in Congress.
The following resolution commending
the action of Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald was unanimously adopted:
\Yhf.ueas, The Labor Commissioner has ren
dered estimable and valuable assistance in
the matter of compiling laws for the benefit of
labor and industrial reform in this State, and
has in addition to that given his nid and coun
sel for the good of the lÃbor movement in
general and this convention especially dur
ing his administration as au officer; whereas,
we deem It proper and just that honest effort
should at all times merit and receive due
recognition and reward; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we in convention assembled
severally and collectively, tender him our
thanks and offer our encouragempnt and in
dorsement to the end that the office may be
made all that it is calculate! to be in the
affairs for which it was instituted, with a view
that the greatest possible amount of good may
be experienced by the world of laborers at
large.
Retolved, That the acts of the present incum
bent oi that position have, in our judgment,
stamped him as a tit and proper, as well as
competent person to perform its many trying
duties.
Resolved, That a copy of these articles be
spread upon the records of this convention
and a copy be presented to E. L. Fitzgerald
nnd also to the press, signed by the president
and secretary.
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT.
August Knoff, a Xeivapaper Carrier,
Injured by tho Discharge of
Ills Gun.
August Knoff, a newspaper carrier on
the Evening Post and Guide, was acciden
tally shot in the left hand and side at
Novato, Marin County, yesterday after
noon.
Knoff and another young man, John M.
Sauter.who resides at 1408 Stockton street,
had been out hunting in Marin County
during the past two days, and on their
return employed a man named John
Brown, who keeps a ranch near Novato,
to drive them to the railroad station.
Brown hitched up his horse and the two
boys jumped into the tail end of the
spring wagon. Knoff, in order to make
more room, shoved the double-barrel shot
gun from him. and in doing so one of the
hammers c:Â«me in contact with the aide of
the wagon and the gun was discharged,
the full charge going into Knoff's left
band nloncs'ie the thumb, leaving an
ugly hole in the bacK of his hand.
A physician was found who bound up
Ihe wound and advised his companion to
take him to the Receiving H;>-pital in
this City, which was done on the arrival
of the 'Tiburon boat at the wharf. The
thumb was amputated.
The injured boy resides with his parents
at 11 Scott plnce, off Broadway, between
Powell and Mason streets. His father is a
butcher at Wilson's sh^op.
