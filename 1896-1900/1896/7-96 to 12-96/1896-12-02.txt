j INJUNCTION TO BE ASKED FOE
The Board of Education Will S -ek to
Overthrow the Health Board
in the Courts.
The Board of Education and the Board
of Health, two branches of the City gov
ernment, have locked horns and cried de
fiance at each other. The Board of Health
has ordered several of the schools of the
City to be closed for the reason that diph
theria threatens to become a widespread
epidemic. The Board oi Education scoffed
. at the fears of the Board of Health and
ordered 'he schools to be opened again.
Both boards imme.liately rushed to arms,
8O far as such ordinarily quiet and civil
bodies can, and they made yesterday a
day of excitement in their immediate,
provinces. Â . â¢/"
Deputies were stationed about the
schools by the Board of Health with or
ders to see that the doors were kept closed
and that the pupils were not admitted.
The Board of Education, feeling the
breath of this opposition, assembled by
special call and there was hot counsel in
the direction of sending an army of other
deputies to meet and combat the deputies
of the Board of Health. This fiery temper
was allowed to sizzle a bit and then it was
decided that the courts would be appealed
to and an injunction would be asked
this morning restraining the Board of
Health from infer.'eriug with the snecial
powers aad responsibilities of the Board
of Education.
School Director Henderson was arrested
yesterday by Health Inspector Cameron
for tearing down a warning notice posted
. y the latter, and Father Brennan has
been served with a warrant which calls
him before Police Judge Campbell this
morning on a charge of having violated a
health ordinance in that be opened St.
Francis parochial school after it had been
ordered closed. Other arrests are threat
ened to follow along in quick succession.
In the meantime the pupils of the closed
schools are having a vacation and are en
joying it macb more than the ordinary
P'osaic holiday affair, which comes among
the blessings that are expected and ac
cepted as a matter of right.
The boards of Health and of Education
have had a row coming for a lone time.
Several times the Board of Health has
made forma) complaint of the unsanitary
condition of nearly all the schools, with
special emphasis upon certain of them.
Warnings were hied more than a year aeo |
concerning the unsanitary plumbing in
these schools in the Mission. Several
times during the past year the Board of
Health peremptorily ordered the closing
of this or that school until some disease
breeding infraction of the sanitary 'aws
was corrected. The Board of Health de
clares that the Board of Education prom
ised to have the old unsanitary plumbing
taken out ot these schools in the Mission
and new regulation plumbing substituted
during the long summer vacation and
that they wholly failed and neglected to
do so.
When diphtheria broke out in the
vicinity of these schools and a number of
cases were directly traced to them the
board felt not only justified but impelled
to order them closed as a means of pro
tecting the lives of the children. When
the Board of Education cried "hardship"
and "outrage" the Board of Health
simply pointed to the record and said,
â¢'lt is upon your own head; we forewarned
you."
On the ether hand, the Board of Educa
cation sets forth a broad ground of griev
ance. In the first place it declares that
there is no cause for the alarm that the
Board of Health has struck. Dr. Clinton
and Dt. Soper, members cf the Board of I
Education, flatly deny that there is any
epidemic ot diphtheria* in the City or any
part of the City.
Dr. Clinton declare* that the largest
part of his practice is in that part of the
Mission said to be affected, and where the
schools are iocated, and he emphatically
says that there iB no cause for the fear
expressed by the Board of Health. The
few cases of diphtheria reported, he says,
does not indicate the possible spread of
the disease, and of those few cases a con
siderable proportion are not diphtheria at
all.
The next ground of complaint is that
the Board of Education offered to make
ouch alterations as could be effected with
the money at hand, and which would put
the schools in perfectly safe sanitary con
dition for the time beingâ more than
which is entirely impossible for lack of
money. Finally the Board of Education
claims that the action-of the Health Board
is arbitrary and an unwarranted interfer
ence in its affairs.
School Director Henderson, when he
tore down the warning notice posted by
Health Inspector Cameron, knew, be
says, that he would be arrested. He was
eager, however, to put the matter to the
test. He declares that the health inspec
tors have no authority to make arrests,
v especially to arrest officials, a*nd he will
push the matter in the courts.
The schools closed are the Mission
Grammar and Marshall Primary on Mis
sion, near Sixth street, the Everett on
Sanchez, near Sixteenth street, and the
St. Francis parochial on Dolores, near
Sixteenth street.
They have been shut up for several

HENDERSON ARRESTED.
The School Director Challenges the
Health Board by Tearing Down
Its Notices.-
Yesterday morning, the second day of
the school and health war, opened with
the arrest of School Director H. C.
Henderson and Thomas F. Lowney, a
clerk in the Recorder's office, charged
with tearinc down diphtheria placards
from the school buildiues. The Directors
had expressed their determination to fol
low the example set by Father Brennan of
St. Francis School Monday and open the
Mission Grammar and the Marshall and
Everett primary schools, and the Board
of Health was equally determined to pre
vent the same.
Dr. Lovelace, with a force of eighteen in
spectors, was early on the ground and
they took their stations at the gates of the
school inclosures. Their labors were
quite easy, ior as fast as the pupils put in
an. appearance they were told that they
couki have a nice holiday vacation, which
privilege they accepted with their joyous
school yell. â  '. â¢
Then they stood -around to witness the
turning oi the tables for once on the teach
ers. When these tried, to enter the build
ings. they were politely told that the vaca
tion extended to them also.
The proceedings were enlivened some
what by the appearance of Superintend
ent Babcocfc at the Grammar School.. This
officer was also informed regarding the
vacation and, notwithstanding his pro
tests, was refused" admittance.
About 9 o'clock School Director Hender
son appeared at the- door of the Marshall
Primary and demanded that the doors be
opened. He was tcjd by Inspector J. W.
Cameron that the Board of H.alth had
ordered the school closed and that he was
there to prevent any entry into the
building. ...
Catching sight of the diphtheria placard
Henderson asked by whÂ«;se orders it
had been placed there. When be was
given the information he declared that
there was not enough force in the Board
of Health to shut the doors of the schools
of this City.,. â¢ .'
He then tore the offending sign down
and was immediately airested by the In
spector. The Director offered no resist
ance, but asked to be taken to the office of
Chief of Police Crowiey, where he was re
leased on his own recognizance.
A short time after this occurrence an
other arrest was made at the pate of the
Mission Grammar. Thomas F. Lowney
tore down the Health Office warning and
was taken in charge by Inspectors Kinnia
and Loane. Lowney is a clerk in the Re
corder's office, and the Inspectors state
that he was. under the influence of liquor.
FATHER BRENNAN'S CASE.
A Warrant Issued for the Priest for
Violating: a Health Ordinance. -
There was much excitement in and
about the St. Francis school when the
children assembled at the instance of
.father Brenna,n. He had assured the
children the day previous that the school
would open its doors as usual. They
were therefore dismayed on their arrival
to be greeted with closed doors and the
formidable sight of six deputies from t.e
Health Office guarding that entrance.
There was nothing for Father Brennan
to do but to come to an amicable agree
ment with those deputies, which he finally
did with some conditions. He agreed not
to open the school and sent the 180 girls
across the street to the Notre Dame Con
vent, where the Sister Superior took them
in charge. The boys were â¢ marched into
the old St. Francis Church and then
Father Brennan proceeded Â» down town to
consult his attorney. When he returned
he sent word to the Sister SuDerior to send
the children from the convent and the
girls were soon gathered with the boys in
the old church. , â¢
The next move was made under some
difficulties. To march the children from
the rear of the church to the school was
not such an easy task. Two deputies had
remained to "guard the school, but their
efforts to restrain the children were un
successful and the pupirs were finally as
sembled in the schoolrooms. J â¢ >'â  â  :
Father Brennan. insists that he is justi
fied in allowing his school to remain open
and declares that ; the opposition of the
Board of Health is the result of the preju
dice felt toward the parochial schools. "j
Yesterday afternoon Inspector Tobin
swore to a complaint against Father
Brennan for violating ordinance 1601 in
tearing down the notices ;p. sted by the
Board of Health. At a late hour two dep
uties called at the parochial residence and
served the warrant for the arrest of the
clergyman. Accompanying the warrant
was a release on his own recognizance
signed by Judge Campbell, and the father
v/as notified to appear in that court this
morning. \

made which, la their judgment and from the.

the controversy may be reached: and the mat
ter finally adjudicated, and that this board
for that purpose employ on 1 its behalf such
attorney or attorneys as may be selected by
the president of this board and the Committee
on Judiciary. .
In support of his measure â  Director
Comte said that the Board of Health, by
attempting to interfere with the Board of
Education, was acting contrary to the
spirit and policy of the laws and was ex
ceeding its authority. He characterized
the actions of the members of the Health
Department |as uncourteous and I illegal
and said it was time the arrogant Board
of Health" was brought to a proper realiza
tion of the rights of 'others. The resolu
tions were adopted unanimously.
Director Murdock read a long resolution
which lie said be had prepared apd mere
ly offered for the consideration of the
board. Its tone was too pacinc^to suit the
other members and Superintendent Bab
cock said that while he appreciated the
sentiments expressed, he thought the
measure already accepted ..was good
enough and that the last paragraph of Di
rector Comte.'s measure was sufficient.; , ';
"We should have no more temporizing

more sugar-coated words for this board.
Let us get an injunction to-night. -We
can rind some Judge and fix the matter up

Then Director Clinton came *in with
more resolutions that were fiery â â  in 'their
tone. In his whereas he characterized the
action of the' Health Inspectors in 'pre
venting scholars from entering the schools
as criminal and uncalled for. He also ad
vocated the calling on the Chief of Po
lice for men to protect . pupils and
teachers. ' He ; moved that Director
Comte's resolution be rescinded and his
own adopted. - . â  \|
It was called to his attention that the
police would probably refuse to interfere
between two departments of the City,
government and then the doctor took an
other tack. ! â¢â  - V- -:â â ;â¢ -
: j "I . move you, sir," he , said, "that \ the

â  Director Clinton collapsed during the

It was finally decided to let the original
resolutions stand.
Immediately after the meeting ad

KEEPS ON ITS COURSE.
The Board of Health Will Not Bend to
the Hoard of Education.
The Board of Health added another
chapter to its controversy with the Board
of Education regarding the closing of the
schools yesterday by refusing to change
its course. A special meeting was held to
wrestle with the subject, and the first
action was taken with reference to the
communication of the Board of Education
declaring its intention of opening the
Everett, Mission and Marshall schools,
and inviting the health officials to inspect
the same. The document was placed on
file without comment.
The health officer read a report showing
the number of cases of diphtheria re
ported during the past month, and a gen
eral discussion on the subject ensued.
Mayor Sutro said that there should be
no conflict between the Boards of Educa
tion and Health, and' that a conference
should be held and some understanding
arrived at.
* Dr. Hart replied tnat the Board of
Health wa9 not fighting the Board of Edu
cation, but was. merely trying to stamp
out the disease.
"Ten cases were reported yesterday,"
he said, "five of them from the vicinity of
these schools, and two from the same
vicinity this morning. It is time we were
making some progress in the fight against
the disease."
The Mayor wanted to know whether it
was not possible to disinfect the schools
while the work of repairing was going on,
and on being told by Dr. Williamson that
such a plan was not feasible said that in
that case the schools ought to be closed.
Dr. Fitzgibbon wanted some action taken
toward forcing the destruction of the bed
clothing of those who had been afflicted
with the disease. He said that in many
cases people sold or gave away the bed
<iothing and' that < ctagi a waa spread
in that way.
No action was taken and the board ad
journed until the Bth, though a meeting
will probably be called in the meantime.
After the meeting it was learned that
Father Brennan had opened the St. Fran
cis School and torn down the diphtheria
placards in defiance of the board, and the
health officer ordered that a warrant be
sworn out for his arrest.
DOCTORS DISAGREE.
.Clinton and Sopar Speak Out About
the Health Board.
What makes the conflict over the health
question the more interesting is that two
of the members of the Board of School
Directors are physicians, practicing their
profession in the Mission, where diphthe
ria germs are said to be holding high car
nival.
Dr. Clinton and Dr. Soper both deny
that there is any ground for the action of
their professional brethren of the Board of
Health. So it is really a case of doctors
disagre ing.
"In my practice in the infested dis
trict," said Dr. Clinton, "I have nothing
to warrant such arbitrary measures, such
as the closing ot the schools and frighten
ing the parents of the pupils. Many
cases are reported as diphtheria that are
not that disease at all. I remember eight
years ago when I was a member of the
Board of Health we had a smallpox
scare. A lot of those cases were reported
and they were only chicken-pox and some
other skin eruption and yet they were
mistaken for smallpox by physicians
quite as eminent as the gentlemen of the
present Health Board.
"Now, let me say that I have the most
friendly feeling for the members of the
board. I think it is the best health body
the City has ever had, but I think it i's
over-zealous. A diphtheria epidemic did
not exist when they announced it before,
and it does not exist now.
â¦'When the Board of Education, by or
der of the Board of Health, planks the
schoolvard and puts the vaults in sanitary
condition, the latter body has no right to
order the vaults taken out and replaced by
new ones costing a large sum of money.
""It exceeds its powers when it say* that
only a certain kind of plum Ding shall be
used. All that is expected of any citizen
is to keep his premises in good sanitary
condition, and that can be done without
using a particular style of plumbing,
whether the Board of Health favors it or
not. On second thought, it is passing
strange that the Board of Health is
anxious to get a lot of plumbing done at
tins juncture. I wonder who is the
plumber?
"Regarding the vaults, possibly the open
ones are even better than the closed ones
Open vaults may be flushed often and ex
amined daily. Those in the condemned
schools are properly supplied with traps
and no sewer gas gets into the schools.
When the yards are planked and the vaults
flushed the schools are in & sanitary con
dition, the Board of Health to the con
trary notwithstanding."
Dr. Boper spoke in the same strain and
deplored the "scare" that was being need
lessly brought on the City by the closing
and condemning of the Mission schools.
He bad been called to trsat four cases of
'Jiphtheria during the past few months,
and he believed that many of the reported
cases of diphtheria were not diphtheria at
all, and he decidedly disagreed with the
Board of Health.
UNWHOLESOME BUILDINGS
Dr. J. F. Morse States That the
School Directors Were Warned
a Year Ago.
. Dr. John F. Morse, chairman of the
Board of Health, stated yesterday that
the School Directors were notified a year
ago that about thirty of the school build
ings were in an unsanitary condition.
â¢'They said they would repair the
vaults and floors, and otherwise place
those schools in a healthful condition,"
said Morse.
"They repaired about a half dozen and
quit. So we got' tired waiting and- closed
the Mission Grammar, tbe Marshall, the
Everett and the -St.' Francis schools, as'
they are in a deplorable condition. San
Francisco nays $1". 200,000 a year for her
schools ar.d the City is not getting the-,
right return for. trie money. I am glad
this question has come up in this shape,
as the Board of Health wants to know just
where it is at and 'how much power it ban
in the enforcement of sanitary -regula
tions.
'Dr. Clinton takes upon himself to
criticize the action of this board and'states"
that of the eighty, cases of ' diphtheria
reported during the past two months only
a small percentage was really diphtheria.
He thus questions tbe diagnostic abilities
of the physicians who reported those
cases, when he" himself knows nothing
about them.
"Health Officer Lovelace says the or
ders of the Board of Health will be car
ried out to the letter and the. school
houses of the City put in such a condition
that they will not breed a pestilence.
There is diphtheria in the Mission and
the new cases coming in every day proves
that the contagion is spreading. The
Board of Education was long ago notified
that the buildings were- in need of repairs,
but Wt did not heed the warning."
THE CONDEMNED SCHOOLS
Dr. Hart Says the Board crtj Health
Only Desires to Protect
the Pupils.
The, following Is from an interview with
Dr. Henry H. Hart, a member of the
Board of Health:
It is the intention of the Board of Health to
keep the schools closed that were condemned
at a previous meeting, and it is also the
intention of the board to condemn all public
and private schools that are in an unsanitary
condition.
The very fact that new planking was put
down in the .Everett and Mission Grammar
and the Marshall Primary schools after being
ordered done by the Board of Health is an
admission on the part of tne Board of Educa
tion that it was rotten and not n't for
further use aud dangerous to health and life;
otherwise the work would be lel,t undone.
it is not the intention of ibe Board of Health
to make war with tbe Board of Education, but
'we are buttling with one of the most terrible
diseases that tbe human family can be afflicted
withâ diphtheria. Tbe Board ot Health does
not wish to convey the idea that an epidemic
of diphtheria exists in this City, but we do
know that it prevails in the portion of the
Mission in which the above-named schools are
located.
Within the past sixty days nearly 100 cases
of diphtheria have been reported to tbe Henlth
Office, followed by a number of deaths of inno
cent children.
A large proportion of cases have been
traced to the schools, and uuder tbe circum
stauces the health authorities have taken the
matter in hand, not to create a hardship on
the people, but to protect the innocent chil
dren and even adults, who are exposed lo the
dread disease. As health officers it is our
duty to look after the saultary affairs of this
City. That our public schoools are in an
unsanitary condition is a- well-known fact,
and a year ago the Board of Education prom
ised to place them in a sanitary condition, but
have failed to do so.
I should think it the duty of the members of
the Board of Education to work band in hand
with the Board of Health iv this matter.
Most of them are men of families and we do
not know where the blow may fall next.
The Board of Education are now willing to
modify the form of plumbing that exists. They
are willing to have a greater flow of water
into the closets, but this is not considered by
experts as sanitary plumbing. Again the
above fact is proof that tbe Board of Education
admit that there is something radically
"wrong, for why do they want to make any
changes at all In the plumbing if it was not
absolutely necessary lor the welfare of the
school children and teachers?
My opinion is that the Board of Health has
absolute power in this matter and all other
matters pertaining to the health of San Fran
cisco. Tbe people look to the health authori
ties for protection against epidemics, and now
that we have so many cases of diphtheria in
the neighborhood above mentioned we warn
them to keep their children from such schools
as are condemned by the Board of Health, and
have them return when the schools are de
clared by the Health Officer as being in a sani
tary condition.
Tne people who are taxpayers have a right
to demand of the city authorities sanitary
schools, as two- thirds ot a childhood's life is
spent at school.
We have no objection for the school board,
or, in fact, any individual to test the power
and right of the Board of Hex lth.
The present Hoard of Health have labored
night and day for the welfare of the people
and the City ; our work is voluntary; no re
rnunt-rauon is received; we expect none; but
while we are in office it is our intention to
devote our every energy to elevate the health
standard of one of the most beautiful cities
in the world.
It is our intention, if possible, to cleanse
this City from one end to another, which will
include public as well as private institutions,
the rich as well as the poor. It is for the p' >
pie that we act; they expect it.
THOSE RED SIGNS.
School Director Henderson Object
to Danger Signals on the School
Buildings.
School Director H. C. Henderson took
his arrest quite philosophically and said
he expected it, but was determined to take
a decided stand against what be considers
to be the arbitrary action of the Board of
Health.
"The placing of those flaring red danger
sisrns around all over f he schooTproperty,''
â¢said .he last -eyehing, "was unnecessary
and-improper. ' So I-began. proceedings by
tearing one of thetn down. â¢ . â â¢â¢..
"Qf course' "the inspector, arrested me
.and I submitted without a word, believ
ing at-the time.thafc he.w.a;s authorized to
make. an. arrest. Bu.t 1 .was .afterward
'.told at the- officer of ihe. Chief of Police
-that he had no-legal right .to- make that
arrest," If T" had. .known -that I would"
have resisted such action.
â¢ "If. I thought for ah instant that the
life of any pu"pil-was placed : in jeopardy
by attendance at any- school in this City
by reason of its sanitary condition! then 1
would be the first- to advocate the closing
of that school. But Ido not believe such
is the case: and -I shall object tc the lock
ing of the. school . doors,- you may depend
upon -it.''
MORE DIPHTHERIA.
Three New 'Cases Were Reported
.at the Health Office
â¢Yesterday.
While the Boards of Education and
Health are preparing for war over the
closing of the school from which the lat
ter body believes . that " â¢diphtheria 'is
-spreading, the dread disease* continues its
â ma^ch.
Three new cases were reported from the
Mission yesterday, making -thirteen for
the. past three days. They were located as
follows: 108 Ha.rtford street, 4577 Eigh
teenth street and 219}^ Sancbez street.
One death was also reported, that of a
child living at 4214 Nineteenth stfeet.

To you, personally,' sir, whom I had the
pleasure of knowing before that event, lex

victim for some weeks has at least contributed
to increase the hope cherished in Irish hearts
to see In the future the triumph of their strug

been able to prove by this event the support
given us by the French press.

WEYLER'S POLICY
OF EXTERMINATION
But the Cuban Army Has
Been Strengthened by
Supplies.
Insurgents Now Control at Least
Three-Fourths of the Troubled
Island.

Pi aces-
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. I.â Senor
Gonzales C^uesada, who represents the
Cuban Junia in Washington, was inter
viewed to-day regarding the situation of
affairs in Cuba. He asserts that General
Weyler has entered upon a policy of ex
termination, and that he is pursuing this
course in compliance with his instructions
from Spain.
"The same course," he said, "has been
pursued in the Pnilirpine Islands, as
scores of reputable English witnesses have
testified. In the Philippine Islands all
the tortures of tbe Inquisition have been
brought into requisition, and the proof is
positive that sixty revolutionists were put
in tbe Black Hole in Manila and asphyxi
ated."
Speaking of the military situation in
the island, Senor Qucsada. explained that
the Cuban army had been strengthened
and made ready for an active winter cam
paign by the landing oi 75Q0 rifles and
several pieces of artillery, as well as a big
supply of ammunition and medical stores.
Tiie insurgents now number 35,000 men,
:id this number will be doubled as s-oon
v the proper arms can be supplied them,
lie denies the stories of sickness among
the insurgents, and explains that they are
thoroughly acclimated and determined to
continue the fight indefinitely. Food
supplies .are also plentiiul, and even
Maceo, who occupies the least favorable
province, that of Pinar del Rio, has cattle
enough to last his forces two years.
"Three-fourths of the island," Senor
Qiesada continued, "is in the hands of
tne Cubans under the contro. of the
civil government. In the provinces of
Santiago de Cuba and Port au Piince the
Spanish hold but five or six inland towns
and they are heavily garrisoned. Some of
these towns are now being besieged by tbe
Cubans, the last one taken by the
patriot forces being Guairamo. General
Calixto Garcia took this town after a
twelve days' siege. There were sixteen
forts protecting the town and one by one
they were disabled by our artillery and
abondoned by their Spanish garrisons,
who took refuge and barricaded them
selves in a large stone church in the cen
ter of the town. General Garcia ordered
twelve-pounder and six-pounder guns to
be used against the massive old bniiuing.
"The Spanish sent messages to Caste
llanos for re-enforcements, but were com
pelled to surrender before he arrived. -
One captain, four lieutenants, twenty-five
subaltern officers and nearly 300 privates
surrendered. Weyler's policy of shootirfg
prisoners was not carried out by General
Garcia, who sent nineteen wounded to the
Save
The expense of doctors' bills. " Keep your blood
pure, your digestion: good and your .system
regular at this season by taking a course of
Hood's
Sarsaparilla
The bestâ ln fact the One True Blood Purifier.
Hood'TPills ar Â« the only pills to take

Spanish ranks. The Spanish commander,
General Castellanos, sent.six carts to get
tbe wounded, thus accepting the prison
ers, who were delivered by the Cuban gen
eral, Lope Kecio. Thus it will be seen
that the Cubans are recognizing the
humanities of war despite the murderous
policies of their enemies.
"In Guairamo we secured $21,000 in
Spanish gold, over 306 Mauser rifles, 125,
--000 rounds of ammunition, 500 machetes
and a large supply of clothing and medi
cal stores. An active campaign will be
continued by our forces while Weyler \%
fruitlessly attempting to catch Maceo.' 1
St nor Quesada in conclusion said that a
siege of Havana would begin if the insur
gents can send enough artillery, includ
ing their dynamite guns, to thai point.
He does not know what action the United
States will taKe with reference to the revo
lution, but thinks that the President's
message will define tbe administration's,
policy.

LAST WARNING TO SPAIN
Jlelitf That the President Will Soon Ja sue
â ;â '. ;â 'Â£;â ./Â»â  a 3le*<aoe. ' * . Â« '':
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. I.â A special
to a morning paper from Washington
says: A crisis in the affairs of Cuba is
rapidly approaching, and there is every
reason to oelieve that President Cleveland
has already decided on a course .which
will startle the country almost as .much
as did his famous messaee on Venezuela,
although the exact time for the announce*
ineni depends somewhat on future opera
tions in Cuba. ' â¢ Â Â°Â° â¢ %
By this action the President will not
change his previous policy in "â¢ regard
to Spain and Cuba in any regard,. but
will simply carry it out to its logical
conclusion, which is a direct, and,
open threat of active intervention on the
part of the United States to secure peace =
in the island whether by the independence
at the patriots or by voluntary action on
the part of Spain. " '' ' .?.
'-. From three different sources this even
ing the policy partially agreed upon be- Â°
tween Secretary Olney ,. and v President
Cleveland was learned, and the c reports in
each case tallied with surprising. : unan
imity. V'~ ' .Â°. â¢/ ".'â¢". ?
â¢ A definite and somewhat startling an
nouncement on the Cuban question will
be made to Congress either in', the regular
annual message or in a supplementary*
communication, as was the case in deal
ing with the Venezuelan question. ' .=
Minister Depuy de Lome pi' the Spanish
Legation has been fully advised of the im
pending announcement, and he accepts,
what is in effect an ultimatum, believing
that Spain will be able to prevent action
on the part of the United States by the
success of Weyler's operations in Cuba. â¢ "
The policy adopted .is scarcely a matter 1
of debate any longer and r unless there
should be some sudden change in the
island, through the success or failure
of Weyler's campaign, the issue will soon
be sharply drawn ween this .country
and Spain. ' .m. m -\ .â  'l' .â¢.:â ;â â¢ """'.â ." ' V
In his communication to Congress,
when . it shall come. President Cleve
land will, in all probability, declare that
daring the last year since he com
municated on the subject there has'
been furnished no evidence of the
immediate termination of the war which
has devastated Cuba and which interferes
so seriously with the commerce of the
United States. He will show that, on the
one hand, the Cubans avoid a direct con
diet, and that, on the other, up to the
present time the Spaniards have been
utterly unable to quell the insurrection.

Business Men Form Plans

Convention.
Soon a Formal Call Will, Be
Issued for the Assemblage
at Indianapolis'. . .
It Is Urged That Uncle Sam Should.
Go Out of. the Banking
Business.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. I.â A Na
tional commercial convention will be held
in this city early next year, probably Jan-
uary.l2, for the purpose of suaeesting suc-h â 
legislation as may be necessary to place
the currency system of t c country on. a
sound and permanent basis. This. action
was the practical outcome of the conven
tion callel by the Indianapolis Board of
Trade, which finished its work to-day.
The formal call for the general conven
tion will be issued in a few days by a sub
committee of Itid:anapo!i3 delegates.
At 2:10 p. m. Justus C. Adams, president
of the Indianapolis Board of Trade, called
â¢the conference to order, and Secretary
Smith called the roll of cities. President
Adams then read an address, in which he
stated, in view of the recent election, the
people want a stable currency, Â»nd with
such an end in view the Board of Trade
called the conference.
He hinted that the retirement of the
greenbacks is a step in the right direction.
President Adams said further:
''Within the last year the people of this
country have shown that they are op- I
posed to a cheap and fluctuating doliar of]
an uncertain value and that they are not .
disposed to follow untried paths that lead
to business unrest or new departures in
financial theories that would only end in
National dishonor and a depreciated cur
rency. We must not take this over
whelming expression of the people, how
ever,'as a final and complete settlement
of the issues involved nor as an unques- I
tioned acceptance of our present mone
tary system, but rather as a protest
against a step backward. Between the
lines of the returns of the recent election
there is shown a pronounced public senti
ment favoring currency reform, with an
evident purpose on the part of the con
servative and reflective men to examine
into our National finances and remove,
with the least possible delay, whatever
weakness or defect that may appear.
"Different views are entertained as to
the method of procedure and details of
plans in the matter of currency revision,
but after our grievous, and costly expe
rience we are forced to the conclusion
that the time has now- arrived when the
Government must either discontinue the
banking business with its expensive and
complicated system, or go into it on a
broader, mor| comprehensive scale. The
came is not worth tbe candle. The burden
is too heavy to be safely borne, and no
individual, corporation or Government
can conduct business on a safe and sound |
basis who or which has demand notes for
millions of dollars in existence and circu
lation, which notes are liable in a -period J
of stringency anil panic to be brought to
the counter for redemption, and wnen so.
redeemed are reissued, thus acting as a
standing menace to the Government re
serve and a continual threat to the trade
and business of the country, causing dis
turbance and unsettled values of every
character.
"Politicians are proverbially timid, even
to the verge of cowardice, and are often
indisposed to consider economic questions :
or matters of National policy until sup- j
ported by public sentiment, but whey that,
sentiment is crystallized and given definite*
shape by the commercial bodies and busi
ness men of the Nation it becomes a moral
ferce and reorganized power which 'our.
lawmakers will not ignore or refuse to
heed. It would be safe to predict that our
National Congress wonld receive tne well
matured, fully considered and practical
recommendations of the active successful'
men of affairs who are in touch with the
trade and commerce of the country as an
authoritative declaration favoring a recon
struction of our financial methods and
system and give it the thought and atten
tion its importance demands."
Upon motion of Delegate Smalley of St.-
Paul each commercial organization pres
ent was'allowed three votes. Ex-Governor
Stannajd of â¢ Missouri was' made perma
nent chairmau. Secretary Smith of In
dianapolis was made permanent secretary.
Mr. Smalley offered a' resolution to the
eS ct that a call be issued inviting repre
sentatives of commercial bodies of cities
of the United State? of over 25,000 inhab
itants to attend a National convention to
be held in Indianapolis in 1897 to discus's
the financial question, to offer remedies
to Congress or to advise tbe appointment
of a commission to prepare proper reme
dies.
Delegate Tanner of Indiana presented
an amendment to that portion of Mr.
Smalley's resolution with reference to the
representation of the various cities. Mr.
Tanner's amendment recommended a rep
resentation according to the' population of
1890 of cities of 8000 and ev%r to be repre
sented, which would make a convention
of about 1250 delegates. The amendments
were accepted by Mr. Smalley, and it was
referred to a sub-committee which was
appointed to consider and report upon it.
Attorney-General Miller and John R.
Wilson, both of Indianapolis, addressed
the conference at some length. .
â¢ At the close of Mr. Wilson's address,
Mr. Smalley of St. Paul offered p. resolu
tion calling a National convention. A
difference arose over the method of repre
sentation, and the question was finally
referied to a committee composed of M.
E. Ingalls of Cincinnati, H. H. Hanna of
Indianapolis, F. T. Roots of Connersville,
E. V. Smalley of Bt. Paul and Mr. Kaus
man of Chicago.
The committee reported a resolution
declaring it the sense of the conference
that.a general convention of commercial
bodies be called at Indianapolis on Janu
ary 5, for the purpose of suggesting such
legislation as may be necessary to place
the currency system of the country upon
a sound and permanent basis, The de
tails -of representation were left to an
executive committee.
This executive committee formed a sub
committee of Indianapolis delegates who
will issue a formal call in a few days.
This executive committee met to-day ana
adopted tne following basis of representa
tion: One delegate of cities from Â»000 to
10,000, two delegates from cities or from
10,000 to 15,000; three delegates for cities
of from 15,000 to 20,000, four deleeates for
cities of from 25,000 to 50,000, five delegate*
for cities of from 50 000 to lOtf.OOO, six dele
gate* for cities of 100.000 to* 200,000, seven
delegates for cities of from 200,000 to 400,
-000, eight delegates for cities of from 400,
-000 to 1,000,000, twenty delegates for cities
of 1,000,000 or over. It was found that the
hall could not be secured on January 5,
and the date was left to a nb-committee.
It will probably be fixed at January 12.

CANNON UPPOSED IT.
â  Says There iÂ« Xo Chance to Fan the
â â  â¢'.'â¢*. : ; lilnaley Bill.
WAStiINGTON, D.. C, Dec 1.-Senator
'.Frank Cannon arrived this morning. He
is the first of the silver Republican Sena
tors who voted against the Dingley bill
last session to arrive. Speaking of the
.'proposition', to pass the Dingley bill at
â '.this session, he.sai'i he did not think an
effort to pass it wouid be made.
"The objections to that measure have
.been accentuated and magnified. It was
seen at the last session that it was not a
good bill. This is even more apparent
now. Some ot the interests that favored
it before are now opposed to it. Conspic
uously the wool-growers are opposing it.
If .an attempt is made to pass tbe bill the
suspicion will be strengthen d that it was
designed to be the finality of tariff legisla
tion for the present.
'â¢It, in effect, is a general tariff bill and
number of interests would be content to
stop with it, as they are amply provided,
for. If another bill we're designed to fol
low, this act would have no more than
six months to rnn and business wou id
have no time to a i just itself to one set
of new conditions before another would be
forced upon them."
"How about the proposition for a com
mission to work on an international Agree
. merit on silver?" was asked.
' '"I will repeat what some of the folks on
the other side have said: An international
agreement is but an iridescent dream.
It has been said by some of the anti-silver
people. that agitation of the free-coinage
question delays international agreement.
That is a mere assertion. We have facts
and history for' it that every effort toward
international agreement has been an in
jury to silver. No movement of thatsort
is in* the interest of silver." , â¢
Senator Cannon said that he regarded
Senator' Dubois' re-election as assured.
Will Oppose Protection.
NEW YORK, S. V., Dec I.â Senator
James K. Jones of Arkansas, chairman of
the Democratic National Committee, and
Congressman McMillin of Tennessee were
at the Murray Hill Hotei to-day. To a
reporter Senator Jones said that tbe
Democrats in the Senate would make no
factious opposition to the Dingley bill.
He added, however, that he would oppose
Republican protection measures and
would support the present tariff law in
force.',.
Congressman McMillin, who is a mem
ber of the Ways and Means Committee
and the Democratic leader in the House,
declared that he would oppose any at
tempt to pass a protection bill, especially
one based on the McKinley measure. Nor
would he support -uiy tariff measure that
advanced the duties beyond the present
rates now in force. The present law, he
declared, is much preferable to the Ale-
Kinley bill.

GAVE UP OFFICE
Disliked by the Spaniards
Because He Defended
Americans.
As Consul-Geoeral to Cuba He
Would Not Permit Treaties
to Be Violated.
fn the Past Citizens of This Country
Were Court-Martiated and Shot
in Short Order. "!â¢'
NEW YORK, N. V.. Dec. I.â General
Bamon O. Williams, ex-Consul- General of
the United States at Havana, arrived at
bis home in Brooklyn to-day from a trip
through England, France and Spain. Re
garding the circumstances surrounding
bis resignation as Consul-General at Ha
vana last year and about which so much
was said at the time, Mr. Williams in an
interview this afternoon said:
"There was a treaty between this coun
try and Spain made In the year 1795, and
article VII of that treaty was construed
by the representatives of the two coun
tries in a protocol signed January 12, 1877,
by Caleb Cashing on behalf of this Gov
ernment and the Minister of State of
Spain.
"On the first day of the present rebel
lion in Cuba, February z4, 1895, three
naturalized American citizens were ar
rested by older of the Captain-General of
Cuba, who announced that, he would court
martial them. They were Messrs*.
Banguilly, Aguirre and Camllo, taken as
insurgents.
"Article VII of the treaty of 1795 pro-
Tides that unless arrested with arms in
band, threatening the sovereignty of
Spain in 'Her dominion, American citi
eens, no matter what the charge against
them was, must be accorded a civil trial.
These men, arrested at noon one day,
were court-martialed and sentenced to
imprisonment lor life. I protested that
this was a violation of the protocol.
"Both the Captain-General and the
Insular Secretary of State were entirely
ignorant of the existence of article VII.
as well as of the protocol construing it,
and thereupon the Captain-General be
came offended because I demanded tne
transfer from military to civil jurisdiction
of the prisoners and the case was reported
in such a manner to the Madrid Govern
ment as to almost provoke the revocation
of my exequatur.
"They did not succeed, ho waver, be
cause the Minister of State at Madrid was
acquainted with the existence of the |
treaty and within eighteen days after the
captain-general had taken offense at my
stand be, by instruction of the Madrid
Government, granted everything I had
asked for, thereby showing that I was
right and the Captain-General was in the
wrong. The case of Sanguilly, Aguirre and
Carriilo was transferred to the jurisdiction
of the civil authorities in Cuba. Since
then Banguiily's case was carried on ap
peal from the Superior Court of Havana
to the Supreme Court of Spain and the i
proceedings of the Havana court have been
entirely reversed and a new trial ordered.
Thus it was shown again by the highest
judicial authority of Spain that I was
right in demanding the transfer of these
gentlemen and that the Captain-General
was wrong.
"I was euided in this by a recollection
of similar cases which have come under
my notice in Cuba. I was a young man
employed as a clerk in Havana in 1851
when the Crittenden men were shot re
gardless of article VII and the treaty of
1795. I was a merchant in Havana when
the Virsinins men were shot in 1873 in ah
almost similar case.
"Again, while I was there, Reccanoa, an
American citizen who had gone, repre
senting certain Spanish elements, to ne
gotiate term&of peace with the insurgents
in the eastern part during the last insur
rection in 1878, and who was arrested by
the Spanish forces, was tried by court
martial, condemned to death and shot in
the fort of Cabanos, where Sanguilly and
the Conrpetitorjprisoners are now held, re
gardless of the safeguards of article VII of.
the treaty of 1795 and the safe conduct
given to him by the Spanish Minister at
Washington. The recollection of these
eases animated me to make quick and
earnest defense of these men, and it was
this action on my part that gave offense
to the Spanish authorities in Cuba.
"I was then in Washington. Acting on
the rule that no man of self-respect will
want to return to or enter any place
wbere he believes that he is persona non
grata, and therefore not welcome, I re.
solred not to continue longer in the posi
tion of Consul-General to the island and
signified my desire to resign. The cir
cumstances, however, were of such a
character that I went back to Havana, re
snzned charge of the office and continued
the defense of Sanguilly until the case was
transferred to the civil courts.
"A few months before this an Ameri
can citizen. John Cepireo. had been ar
rested and subjected to court-martial, and
several other American citizens had beer,
treated the same way, and in- con sequence
I was not ai>le to present my resignation
in due form until Febsuary, 1896. My suc
cessor was appointed in April, and in
June I personally transferred ihe office to
General Lee, the incumbent."

ment of No. 754. The store and cellar
were occupied by the Rothschild Sons'
Company, manufacturers of bar fixtures
and billiard-tables. The store extended
through the building from Broadway.
The flames spread with remarkable
rapidity, and iv a few minutes after the
arrival of the first firemen the second and
third floors, occupied by Leo Goodman &
Bro., necktie-manufacturers, and the
flourth floor, occupied by David M. Garber,
a photographer, caught fare.
The flames tiien spread to the roof of
the building on the south side, occupied
by E. V. Connett & Company, hat-mak
ers, and the second, third and fourth
floors by Hoizman Brothers, manufac
turers of boys' suits.
"While the firemen were trying to save
the Connett building, 756 Broadway, the
.front o.'.the building in which the firÂ«
started, burst into flames which reached
to a great height in the air and half
across Broadway. ; .-"'
After a battle of an hour and a half the
fire was got under control. The third and
fourth floors and roof of the Connett
building were damaged. E. V. Connett &
Co. lost $30,000 and Holzman Brothers
place their loss at $24,000. The building,
754 Broadway, was completely gutted.
The Rothschild loss is about $75,000, the
Goodman loss $25,000 and the pho
tographer $2000. The loss on the building,
owned by the Boston estate, is over $50,
-000. The losses given are reported by the

WHILE LIFE HUNG BY A THREAD.
Rev. Louis Frederick Giroux Takes a Bride
While Supposed to Be Dying, but
He May Recover.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. Lâ A Journal
special Jrom Springfield, Mass., says: With
his life hanging by a thread. Rev. Louis
Frederic* Giroux, instructor in the
French-American College in this city,
mairied Miss Louise Battel Sampson,
principal of the women's department in
the same institution, yesterday. Since
Giroux was taken ill Miss Sampson has
watched over him, and when it was an
nounced yesteidav that he had developed
sy.mrtoms of diphtheria she was quaran
tined in the house with him.
The marriage certificate was taken out
by Rev. S. H, Lee, president of the col
lege, who performed the service in the
presence of the attending physician and
the nurse. 'â¢ . '.
The couple were engaged last Septem
ber and (he wedding was set for Christ
mas day. Giroux was taken ill two weeks
ago. It was at first believed that he had
typhoid fever, and he was treated for that
disease. Misa Sampson called to see him
daily, and was- at his bedside when the
physician announced that the patient had
diphtheria, and that the chances of his
recovery were small. â¢
"Miss Bamp a on telegraphed her guardian,
Leander Ctramberlain of New York, ask
ing him if he would sanction her mar
riage, knowing that Mr. Giroux might not
live the night out. A favorable reply was
received, and the marriage ceremony,
which' was made' as brief as possible, fol
lowed. Giroux was greatly improved last
night, and it is now expected that the
bridegroom's life will be save.d. .

GREAT VICTORY
FOR THE PRIESTS
Judgment Rendered by the
Metropolitan Ecclesi
astical Court. .
Bishop Bonacum Judged to Have
Been Actuated by Vindic
tive Motives.
So He Is Ordered to Pay the Costs
of Tritl and Expenses of
Exonerated Priests. .
DUBDQUE, lowa, Dec. I.â The jud K^
ment of the Metropolitan Ecclesiastical
Court of the Roman Church iv the
famous case of Bishop Bonacum of Lin
coln, Nebr., against Fathers Fitzgerald
and Murphy of his diocese was delivered
to-day. The court finds for the priests
against the Bishop on every point in the
appeal, which was ordered by the Propa
ganda of Rome, after Delegate Satolli had
refused to grant one. The Bishop is
judged to have been actuated by sinister
and vindictive motives, to have published
falsehoods and deceived Cardinal Satolli.
The court declares null and void all the
sentences of the Bishop, withdrawing the
faculties of the defendant priests, sen
tencing them to do penance in Canada for
contumacy and condemning them gener
ally.
The Bishop is condemned to pay the ex
penses of the exonerated priests and the
costs of the trial, to pay Father Fitzgerald
$575 and Father Murphy $325, as damages,
and to withdraw the priests he sent to
Tecumseh, Nebr., where Father Murphy
is rector of St. Ambrose Church, and to
Auburn, Nebr., where Father Fitzgerald is
rector of St. Joseph's Church. The pay
ments are ordered to be made to the court
within thirty days. There is no appeal
from the sentence pronounced.
The troubles in the diocese of Lincoln
began soon after the consecration of
Bishop Bonacum in November, 1887. The
Bishops of the province ignored the
priests of the diocese when it was decided
to create a new see, and many of them re
garded the appointment of the Bishop as
void. The next clash was between the
Bishop and Father Kennedy of the ca
thedral in Lincoln over erecting a new
edifice.
Then came bitter resentment on the
part of Hon. .Patrick Egan, President
John Fitzgerald and other prominent lay
league leaders against the Bishop's at
tempt to stop collection of league funds at
church doors in conformity with an edict
from Rome applicable to Ireland. An
other cause of dissension was the suspen
sion of Father Walsh, pastor of the cathe
dral, because Mrs. Sheedy of Lincoln, ar
rested for complicity in her husband's
murder in 1889, had alleged that the pnÂ«st
uttered scandal about the Bishop, after
Father Walsh testified against Mrs.
Sheedy.
Then a battle began between Bishop
and priests, the former bending every
power to drive all the priests who op
posed him from his diocese, and the latter
deiending their civil and ecclesiastical
rights vizorously. In 1891 Father Corbett
of Palmyra, who subsequently sued the
Bishop for libel, was brought before a dio
cesan court to answer charges made by
the head. Father William Murphy of Te
cumseh presided, and the charges against
the Palmyra priest were dismissed.
This made the Bishop furious, but on
appeal the loner court was sustained. In
1893 fifteen priests of the diocese filed, a
lorif? bill of charges with Mgr. Satolli
against their Bishop, and the apostolic
delegate came to Omaha. He decided
that the case should go to the metropoli
tan of the province, and induced the fight
ing Bishop to sign a truce with the priests,
which the Bishop was accused of break
ing. This led to more trouble and the
Corbett-Bonacum fight in the civil courts.
Father Murphy signed the charges and
Father Fitzgerald became involved by
signing the protest which was sent to
Mgr. Satolli by the priests against the
Bishop's alleged violation ef the "truce"
and threatening to prove the charges on
trial ol the injunction cases in the civil
courts.
The result of this protest was that -im
perative orders were sent to Archbishop
Hennessey by the Propaganda and Mgr.
Satolli to hear the charges at once.
Fathers Murphy and Fitzgerald main
tained that the 1 Bishop undertook to de
stroy them so that the charges against
himself could not be revived. He sent
them letters of expulsion from the dio
cese for failure to pay the diocesan tax.
The Bishop went to the civil courts to get
possession of Father Murphy's church,
but was beaten six times, and threatened
excommunication of all persons who at
tended their pastor's services.
The Metropolitan court trial began Oc
tober 28 in St. Joseph College here. Arch
bishop riennessy abdicated as Judge in
favor of Rev. Peter Abhart ojf Marshall,
Mich., an authority on canonical law.'
Bishop Bonacum was present only the
first day. The prosecution was conducted
by Rev. Father Slattery of New Hampton,
lowa, and the defense by Father Fitzpat
rick of Dubuque.
IN THE SUPREME COURT.
Decisions [ Disposing : of Thirty- Sight
Cases, Two of Which Are Important. â 
/.WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 1;- The
Supreme Court of the United States re
convened and disposed of - thirty-eight
cases. The most important, aside from
the Chapman case, was that of : the appeal
of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company
from the decree of 'the Supreme Court of
Nebraska directing the railroad company,
at the request of the State. Board of Trans- 1
portation, to j permit a party of farmers to"
erect a grain/elevator on its right of Away;
and itself to ! construct a switch "> thereto/
The case was docketed: in ; the Supreme
Court of i the United States : October 3,
1890, and C was ,; argued < at : the \ last term.
Disposing of :? the r case the "opinion said it
was not a question affecting rates of trans
portation, nor an order compelling the
railroad company to erect an elevator, nor
i a matter affecting equal rights of access to
the property from the outside, but a de
mand that, simply for the convenience of
the petitioners, they be permitted to build
the elevator on the property of the rail
road company. (v^ . i." =: ;
"This," the court is unanimously of the
opin ion,"is the taking of private property
for private use without the due process of
law, and therefore .in', violation of the
plain terms of the constitution." 'â :'â -. - '
The judgment of the. State { court % was
reversed, and i the,; case remanded with
instructions to proceed in conformity with
the opinion. â¢'...â .,. fe- i ;'-V"VvV
In the case of Pleasant Draper vs. the
United States, it was decided that the
wol-ds in the net admitting Montana to the
Union, "and said Indian lands shall
remain under the absolute jurisdiction
and control of Congress of the United
States," do not give to the courts of the
United States in that State jurisdiction
over offenses committed on said Indian
lands.
Draper was convicted in the Federal
court of murder committed on the Crow
reservation, and will now go back to the
State cour.t for trial.
One of the cases set down for argument
this week before the Supreme Court of
the United States is that-of the suit of the
United States against the Trans- Missouri
Freight Association and the fifteen rail
road companit-s comprising the organiza
tion; to dissolve the association as being
in contravention of the trust laws and
also of the interstate commerce law. The
Government was defeated in the. courts
below and the Attorney-General appealed
from the judgment of' the Court of Ap
peals for the EiKhth Circuit: The decree
of that court was by a majority of the
bench, Judge San born delivering the
opinion ' concurred in by Judge Thayer,
while Judge Sbiras dissented. In the
meantime, however, the freight associ
ation has been voluntarily dissolved, and
it is a question whether- or not the court
will consider the case at all, inasmuch as
there can be under these conditions no re
lief afforded the Government. Notwith
standing this a brief in tho case was made
to-day, filed by W. A.. Guthrie, solicitor
for the Burlington and Missouri River
Railroad Company in Nebraska, one of
the defendant corporations.
BISHOP KEANE'S PROMOTION.
The Noted Prelate Makes a Statement
Showing the Object of His Re
moval to Rome. â 
"WASHINGTON, D- C, Dec. I.â Bishop
Keane, late rector of the Catholic Univer
sity, sails for Rome Saturday in response
to the commands of the Pope to come to
that city and perform such duties as ma;
be there assigned him.
In response to the request of a reporter
of the United Associated Presses Bishop
Keanesaid: "When the Holy Father ex
pressed the wish that I should sever my
relations with tha university 1 resigned
the rectorship without regret. Instead of
going into that retirement that would be
so acceptable to me, 1 am now on my way
to Rome. The Holy Father has given me
a position there of honor and responsi
bility, and I shall take the first opportu
nity to assume the new duties with which
I have beeu honored. This much of a
statement will be perhaps of interest, and
I trust that it will set at rest idle rumors
that hay- or may be put in circulation."
Bishop Keanegoes to Rome to become a
member of the Propaganda which deals
with the promotion of faith and has a
vast influence upon the clergy of the
church. It is said that, as an American
representative in this college he wiil be in
a position to do great wort aiid still be in
touch with the peoDle with whom he has
been so long associated.

BRAIN IN A WHIRL!
Sight of a Balloon Ascen
sion Upsets an Old
Soldier.
OLD MEMORIES REVIVED.
The Whirligig of Time, How
ever, Nearly Does Him
Up for Good. ,
A couple of months ago a man was
standing on one of the vacant lots just
outside the Chutes watching the prepara
tions for a balloon ascension. Like they
'say, of a raccoon, having once Â°got his at
tention rrxed on the thing, he could think
of nofuing else â indeed hod eyes for
nothing elsel By-and-by the inflation
was finished, and away went the aeronaut ,
like a flash of lightning. The man's ; eyes
steadily followed ihesDhere as it rapidly <>
rose. There was little or no wind and the
. asceasion was almost perpendicular. Not
once did the man lower bis eyes until the
parachute "commenced to drop, add then
he suddenly became pale, and began to
rub his forehead vigorously. He stag
gered a step* or two and then fell to the
ground. Some friends who were with him
picked him up and carried him to a car,
but he 5 was moaning all the time, "My
head is all. of a whirl." "And that waV
about. the satisfaction that could begot
out of him. He was thin and hollow
cheeked, and the observer in., ordinary
would hav.e said that he had an acute case
of dyspepsia, A reporter got on the same c
car with them, and the woman of 'the
party would insist on their taking the
sufferer home, .while the men .*eemed to
think that the Receiving Hospital was the
right place. But the woman prevailed.
That is usual. â¢ . ...'.
.They went down to Howard street, and
in to, a vefy- nice-looking house. Some re
storatives were applied, and in the course
of an hour or so he was able to taik about
himself. He said: ."1 am a discharged
soldier, having left the army in the East
and come home here, where I live. I
have 'been having these spells of very â¢
funny trouble with my " brain for a long
time now. ' All the time it seems to bn.sfo
ing round like a top. I used to tie quite a
balloonist myself 'once, and I am always
interested in the sport â for that is what it
always was tome. But," he abided sadly, ;
"my days for 'going up' are all. over, I
guess." He continued: ''Many and
many a time have I gone > up â¢ with .Bald
win, and he always praised my coolness,
but now â why, I can't even bold my h,and
"steady."-. Evidently th.ere was something k .
more.Â«erious than dyspepsia the .matter
with him. The woman bad gone to pre- a
pare something ; for. him to eat, so t his'
friend broke in with, "John, if you'd only
got married when you were a young man,
and not played the fool so much, -you
wouldn't be where you are now,: arm you
know it." It seemed a shame to twit the .
poor fellow for his follies in the past, es
pecially when he was in such an evidently
weak state. '.But he did not Seem to mind,
for he simply retorted. M l never did worse
than many others. the only harm I ever
'did was to myself. I'm broken down and' .
never shall get well new, so what's the
use of crying o?er spilt milk?'' ' \ â "â  '
- I* 'â "â  ';* â â â â ;â 'â¦ . :â **-, '~,< Â»'. -fB -
'â  But that, man is alive and well to-day,
and there is quite a possibility that he'
will make many a balloon ascension yet
' before ; he dies. . That same , afternoon,
about an hour after the above conversation
took place, a friend of the sister came in*
and seeing the plight of Wilson â for that's
the ex-soldier and balloonist's name â in* â
sisted that he be taken the next day to the
doctor. 7 There* was no oner could do
him any good he vowed again and again,
but at last he consented to go anywhere if
the young lady would accompany him,, it
so happened - that in her â  home* she had '
seen some circulars and testimonials of
the marvelous work that the well-known
physicians of < the Hudson Medical Insti
tute are doins: with their great vegetable
remedy for nervous and general debility â
the great "Hudyan" â and she . had made -
up her mind that if such wonderful cures
as she had read of could be made that
Wilson still had reason to "hope. And so
the next (Jay they went. â¢ The case was,
after a most careful and complete exam
ination, pronounced perlectly curable,
although it was ' very serious, la' two
months that man is, as said before, quite
restored to strength and vigor.
. "Why did I never*hear of you before?"
he asked one. of the senior surgeons of the
Institute ,' one ; day. ;' ''Because . you never
came for or wrote for our printed matter,'
IV suppose," was the .reply. "We" send
them to any onS and every one who cares
to have them." , *

LAYS CLAIM TO
ALL SKYHOMISH
Legal Contest at Seattle
for the Northern
Townsite.
Scrip Issued in Washington's
Time the Basis for the
Claim.
Was Awarded to the Heirs of a
Messenger Killed During the
Revolution.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. I.â A contest
begun in the United States Land Office
here to-day is full of interesiing features,
not the least of which is the attempt of
John & Sturgis of this city to force ac
coptance by the Government of scrip
issued in settlement of a claim arising out
of the Indian wars during the time of
President Washington's incumbency in
1792. Durine that year Joseph Gerard
waa engaged by Washington to carry a
message to the hostile Indians from Fort
Washington, now Cincinnati, Ohio, to the
Northwest Territory. On the trip Gerard
was killed by the Indians, and not until
1855 was the claim brought by the heirs
properly adjusted by Congress and par
tially satisfied.
Rachel Gerard, Jeter' Rachel G-rard-
Blue-Repse, A. P. Gerard and William
Gerard, children of the messenger, were
given Government scrip entitling each to
one fall section of Government land, lul
filling the spirit of the inducement offered
by General Washington, as the law cassed
at the time said. Later William Gerard
or his heirs returned his scrip and in its
stÂ«ad was issued other scrip, each piece
calling for forty acres of land. It is one
of these later issues which figures in the
contest here to-day.
The land in contest is the townsite of
Skykomish, on the Great Northern Rail
road, and is now worth many thousands
of dollars. Sturgis hopes to have the
Government cancel a squatter's claim
made previous to survey aud award him
the land.
The Great Northern Railroad Company
as successors of the old St. Paul, Minne
apolis and Manitoba Railroad, in 1892 was
awarded a grant of 600,000 acres of land in
this State by Congress in lieu of land
formerly granted to the older road in Min
nesota and Dakota. The Great Northern
in 1893 laid claim to the townsite as part
"of the grant. To-day, however, it with
drew the claim and the contest is now
upon tbe merits of the Sturgis claim and
that of the squatter.
Bturgis alleges that the sqnatter has con
verted the land into a-. towusite in viola
tion of the homestead laws, but the latter
will attempt to show that previous to the
survey the completion of the Great
Northern brongtit ir. a number of town
site boomers whom it was impossible to
keep off the land.
TUe land is now covered by the best part
of the town of Skykomish, while title to it
is in doubt. The contest will last several
days and all important citizens of the
place have been brought as witnesses.
The Gerard scrip involved has been used
in other important local contests. At one
time it was attempted to be filed upon a
tract of land in one of the best residence
sections of this city, wind) originally be
longed to an old donation claim, title to
which was in some doubt. The serin was
originally brought to Seattle by W. C,
Hill, a former resident of Washington, the
prior owner being J. L. Arms, also of the
Capital City.
OREGON SHORT LINE DECREE.
The Road to Be Sold at Auction if the
First Mortgage Debt Is Not Paid
Within Five Days.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. I.â ln tne
Federal Court Here to-uay Judge Sanborn
made a decree in the two cases in which
James M. Ham and Oliver Ames, trustees,
are nlaintiffs and the Oregon Short Line
and Utah Northern Railway Company
and itÂ» receivers are defendants.
By the decree the defendant company is
required to pay to the clerk of the Federal
court $3,417,516, the amount of the first
mortgages and unpaid interest coupons on
the portion of the line known as the Utah
Southern extension, within five days,
otherwise the lines embraced in the sys
tem will be sold at public auction to the
highest bidder for cash after four weeks'
publication of the notice of sale.
Hon. William D. Cornish of St. Paul is
appointed special master to take charge
of the company, immediately on its failure
10 nay thÂ« amount decreed by the court.
By the terms ot the decree all expendi
tures of the system under, the manage
ment of the receivers and the couri^ costs
are considered prior liens to tbe mort
gage, and tne firs* proceeds of the sale
are to be devoted to the liquidation of
whatever may be due on those expendi
tures.
After the sale tbe reorganization com
mittee will assume control of the company,
which shall hereafter be segregated from
the Union Pacific system, and snail be
.known as tbe Oregon Short Line and
Utah Northern Railroad, the change in
title being the subsiitution of the word
"railroad" for "railway."
The decree recites that on July 1, 1879
the Utah southern extension bonds were
issued, with James M. Ham and Hon.
William H. Hooper as trustees. Later
Hooper died and Oliver Ames was substi
tuted as trustee.
The amount of the extension mortgages
undpr these bonds was $1,950,000, and up
to December 1, 1896, the amount of cou
pons and interest due was $462,516, -which
remained unpaid-^a total of $2,417,516.
On July 1, 1879, a general mortgage was
also placed upon the properly to secure an
issue of bonds in the sum oi SI.o^U.OOO.
On July 1. 1881, the Utah Southern and
Uiah Central railways were consolidated
with and operated under r e Oregon Short
Line and Utah Northern Railway ; there
fore, the decree is against that organiza
tion.
The lines affected are now known as tho
Utah Division and the Idaho Division of
the Union Pacific, embracing 1421.2 miles.
The main lines are from Grander, Wyo.,
lo Huntington, Or., Onden, Utah, to Me-
Gammon, Idaho, and Poca^tello, Idaho, to
Silver Bow, Mont., with branches as "fol
lows: Shoshone to Ketchum, Nempa to
Boise and Cache Junction to Preston.

LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE.
I Uleetinq of the Sub- Committee in Charge \
'â ',â *.-, of Important Hill*.
WASHINGTON, T>. :C, Dec. I.â The
sub-committee of the House Committee
on Appropriations, in charge of legisla
tive, executive and judicial bills, met to
day at the Capitol to * work upon the
measure in advance of the assembling of
Congress. c. â â  â¢ â '* /
V They had before them the Civil- Service
Commissioners, the new Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, W. S. I'orman ot Illi
nois, and several chiefs of the Treasury
Department, who set forth the seeds of
their several bureaus. The : policy of" the
committee in regard to appropriations
was outlined by Hon. J. G. Cannon, chair
man, who said to a reporter for the United
Associated Presses: '.'.â '
"As published recently the estimates
for fortifications amount to something
more than $15,000,000 At the last session
of Congress a rnÂ»w and important depart
ure was made with reference to the man
ner of appropriating for fortifications by.
giving to the Secretary of War authority
to enter into contracts for material and
labor in constructing gun and mortar bat
teries at the important ports on our sea
coast to the extent of $2,600,000. "
. 'Â°Just what the department has done in
the way of administration under this
authority has not yet been developed.
''The committee will probably be en
abled to complete the preparation of the
pension appropriation bill and report it to
the House on, the first or second day of the
cpming session, and they expect to have
the legislative bill in condition to report
by the middle or the last of the first week.

â¢â¢The committee," Mr.' Cannon replied,
"wiil^no doubt recommend appropriations
for an.efficient.public service.
"The receipts of the Government, bow
ever, are less than the expenditures, and
this deficit has been and is being made up
by borrowing money at interest. !
"As long as this situation continues the
appropriations': and expenditures will be
held down rigidly to the smallest aggre
gate compatible with the efficiency of the
public service."

BATARD AT THE BANOUET.
Mr Jotejih hitter Huloffizeg the Ameri
can Embaaaador.
LONDON, Esq., Dec. 1. â The anni
versary dinner of the Royal Society was
given yesterday.
Among the guests was Hon. Thomas F.
Bayard, the American Embassador, who
proposed a toast to Sir Joseph Lister,
president of the society. In speaking to
the toast, Mr. Bayard paid a handsome
tribute to the work that had been
achieved.
Mr. Joseph, replying to the toast, eulo
gized Mr. Bayard, who, he said, had en
deared himselt to everybody by bis genu
ine love for ihe old country. Mr.. Bayard,
he added, must have a feeling of greatest
patriotism, as he (Bayard) had quietly re
marked to him that the hopes of his life
had been almost fulfilled and that when
be left he would feel that the clouds that
once serious y threatened the amicable
relations of the United States and Great
Britain had entirely cleared away during
his term of office. This Sir Joseph
ascribe.d as largely due to Mr. Bayard's
beneficent efforts.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1896.
GOLD FOUND IN
A DUCK'S CRAW
The Fowl's Peculiar Diet
Leads to a Rich Dis
covery.
Searchers Locate a Ledge Near
the Ranch on Which
It Fed.
Feathered Flecks in the Vicinity
Sacrificed by Their Eager
Owners.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec I.â News comes
from Ainslie, Lewis County, that Mrs. N.
Henderson last week found several pieces
"punkin seed" gold in tne craw of a duck
she had purchased of a local butcher. Tne
pieces were larger than a flat Seed and
looked as though they had been in the
duck's storage department for some time.
Male members of the Henderson faniiiy
began ac immediate investigation. They
found the dock had been secured from a
Winlock firm, which in turn had pur
chased it of settlers living in the Cowlitz
Valley, east ol Winlock.
Near their ranch a range of hills rises up
from the valley. It was decided to do
some prospecting among these hills and !
an expedition was organized.- Late last
weeK the prospectors' search was rewarded
by the finding of several q,uartz seams near
together at a point nbout-seven miles from
Winlocic Charles Johnson and one of
Mrs". Henderson's sons are reported to
have made the lucky discovery. They
staked out claims and then returned home
for provisions and tools with which to. do
development work. i
Since then snow has cove-ed the hills,
but if it does not get too deep a shaft will
be sunk this winter. Tbe quartz found
appears to be rich in gold, and assays are
now being made. From the way the seams
run it is believed that they will iorm into
one wide vein a short distance below the
surface. . â¢
The find has caused considerable excite-,
meet at Winlock. Several ducks and
geese in the valley have subsequently been
killed to prove the Henderson story from
Ainslie. In oue of these coarse gold,
identical in character with that first
found, was discovered.
MINTON HADN'T TIME
Resigned His Position to Attend
to Other Duties at
San Anselmo.
An Indianapolis Mm to Succeed Him
in Westminster Presbyterian
, Ctittrch.
Rev. Dr. Henry C. Minton, for the past
two years pastor of the Westminster Pres
byterian Church, has resigned. He will
hereafter devote his time exclusively to
the Theological Semiqary at San Anselmo,
in which institution he has long occupied
the position of professor of theology.
The resignation was tendered and ac
cepted at the last session of the elders of
the church, and was entirely the sugges
tion of Dr, Minton.as both the elders arid
congregation were more than delighted-"
with their pastor's work and preachine.
He is considered by many to be the .finest
preacher on the coast. Dr. Minton resides
at San Anselmo, $nd could not devote the
necessary time to pastoral work, and for a
long time past has felt dissatisfied at not
being able to live among his flock.
The Rev. C. C. Harriott of Indian
apolis has been appointed in tbe place va
cated by Dr. Minton. Mr. Herriott-was
pastpr of the Presbyterian church iv In
dianapolis, Ind., for six years and built
the Westminster Preshyterian Church at*
St. Paul, Minn.
Mr. Herriott is a live, energetic man, a
imart preacher, and has already made
himself a favorite with the congregation.
He is not an entire al ranger to them, hav
ing taken Dr. Minton's place last summer
when the latter took his trip to Scotland
to attend the Presbyterian Council in
Glasgow. â  â¢:â¢â¢â â¢
Mr. Herriott has been in California the
last two or three . months, ' conducting
classes on the evangelistic order in imita- '
tlonof the famous Moody Institute. .
THE MAYOR'S IGNORAUCE.
He Did Not Know the Location of the
Free Public Library.
Mayor Sutro has been head of the City
government for nearly two years and yet
up to yesterday afternoon he did not
know where the Free Public Library is
situated.
The officers on duty at the Central Po
lice station were astonished yesterday
afternoon, shortly before 4 o'clock, when
the Alayor made his appearance. ' Not
knowing why they should be so honored
t';ev saluted him. and one of them politely
asked if he could do anything for him.
"Could you tell me where the Public
Library is?' 1 replied tbe Mayor.
"Why, certainly." replied the officer,
pointing wfth his finger out of the rear
window, "it is on the top of that whig."
So that the Mayor could riot make any
mistake a policeman was ordered to ac
company him and show him the entrance
to the library, and when they got there
the Mayor politely thanked him.

PBOTESTING OWNERS.
Delay Asked in Locating tbe Pcstliome
at the City and County Hospital.
A number of property-owners living
about the City and County Hospital ap
peared before the Board of Health at its
meeting yesterday to protest against the
Pesthouse being located at the big home
for the sick.
They asked ninety days' delay in the
matter, and were supported by Mayor
Sutro, who thought that tbe building of
the proposed annex should be delayed
until the Legislature had oeen called, so
that that body might be given a chance to
providt a site.
The whole matter was laid over until the
special meeting that will be held on the

SWAIN, WEHE AND JEROME.
Associated Cycling Clubs' Presidency
a Three-Cornered Fight.
There may or may not be a triangular
fight for the presidency of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs at its annual
meeting next Saturday night, and the
club wheelmen are just now taking a eood
deal of interest in the matter. When
Harlow H. White, the very popular
Olympic clubman, refused momination,
which would have Deen f quivalent to elec
tion with him, the name of A. P. Swain
of the Acme Club was proposed and re
ceived hearty indorsement on all sides.
But opposition sprang up from the San
Francisco Road (. lub, who put forward
A. W. Wehe. Mr. Wehe put up a strong
tight and secured many promises of votes,
but his chief drawback was that he is com
paratively unknown among the wheel
men, wuile Mr. Swain has "been active in
cycling politics lor ypars. Last Sunday
E. B. Jerome of the Reliance Club was
put forward as a compromise candidate,
and Agreed to run if- Swain and' Wehe
withdrew, which it was thought they
would io, as Mr. Jerome would be a hard
man to beat. Wehe was willing,, but Mr.
Swam states that he is in the fis;ht foo far
now to back out, and that he is there to
stay. This has resulted in the coming
back of Wehe. The president has tne au
pointment of all the association commit
tees, including the road pacing board, and
tbe office is therefore a prize in its way.
There will be no contest for the office of
secretary-treasurer, Jules F. 'Hancock of
the Bay City Wheelmen, the incumbent,
is the ojilv candidate, and his excellent'
past record thoroughly entitles him to re
election. â¢; *
The entries for the big meet .to'be iifcld

FRESNO, Cal.. Dec 1.-Mrs. Jennie
HowUnd ami Tbomas Hart were to have
been married in thi? city this afternoon.
Several friends had been invited to wit
ness the ceremony, which was to take
place in "Mrs. John Stevens' lodging- houae
on Mariposa street, and an elegant wed
ding dinner had been prepared for the
happy, occasion.
Wh.en the guests arrrvea to their con
sternation they foaad the prospective
bride in hysterics* ana were told that the
marriage was not to take place.
(They were told that the duplicity of the
. roapective groom had just been discov
ered, Mrs. Holland having received a
note from a Mrs. Hart stating that it was
lier lawfuL husband whom she (Mrs. How
land) tv-as about to marry. . ;' ' :
Hart was not on the scene. He had
made a brief appearance and then left.
He had agreed to arrive with the mar
riage license, but came with the informa
tion that he was unable to secure one.
When told of the note- his prospective
bride bad received from his wife, he con
fessed its truth and said that Mrs. Hart
bad been at tbe County Clerk's office dur
ing the day and warned Cupid's clerk of
the state of affairs.
It was for this reason, he explained,
that he could not procure tbe necessary
license.
Mrs. Howl ind has been working about
tne city for several months as a domestic,
and she has received attentions from and
carried on communication with Hart for
some time.
He was employed during the summer
months as an engineer at Moore & Smith's
sawmills at Sequoia, in tbe mountains.
"Wiiile they were thus separated they -were
in continual correspondence, he being es
pecially endearing in his letters.
The mills closed for the season last
weefc, and it had been previously arranged
by letter that the couple should marry as
soon as he came down to the valley.
Hart arrivedin this city a few days ago ;
and the arrangements for the wedding
were quickly arranged. Mrs. Howlaad
has a number of friends in the city and
she sent them invitations.
Haft was practically unacquainted in
this city and had no one to invite. The
bride's preparations, in which she was
actively assisted by Mrs. Â§tevens, were
somewhat elaborate.
The table for the supper which was to.
foliow the binding of two into one Â«>s. :
carefaliy set during the day and beauti
iuliy decorated with flowers. *,". â¢
Tue prospective bride had just donned
her wedding-dress when a messenger
called at the door with a note for her.
Mrs. Stevens answered the summons and
' took the missive to Mrs. Howland. , '. *;â¢. :
Briefly, it warned her not- to marry .
Tbomas Hart â that the writer was his
lawful wife awl bad beeil for ye"ars. it."
was witb a screech that the unfortunate â 
woman told tbe news to Mrs. Stevens, who
was at her side.
But she would not believe it It must
be the work of some enemy, she said.
Hart was to arrive shortly with the mar
riage license and she would demand bf
him an explanation.
He was on hand a few minutes later and
when told of the missive that had just
been received quietly admitted its
authenticity. * . â¢â¢
He did net seem to be concerned as
much as one generally would under such
circumstances. He stated that his wife
had been to the clerk's office and headed
him off from .getting a license. Hart then
quietly left.
This tended to make matters worse.
Mrs. Howland became frantic and it was
only with great difficulty that she could
be quieted. The scoundrel who so basely
deceived the unfortunate woman is be
lieved to have had no intention of marry
ing her.
His purpose in all probability was to get
possession of what little money ahe had
earned and saved by nard work for many
years. Sne is an honest and industrious
woman. She is 42 years of age, and Hart
is about the same.
There are some who declare their belief
that Mrs. Hart was in complicity with her
husband to rob the unfortunate woman.
He was to make every effort to get the
money, even to go as far as be did, and
then the wile was to come upon the scene
and prevent the marriage.
However, if- this were the scheme, it
â¢was not successful, for Mra. Howland re
fused to let Hart have any of her hard
earned money.
It was learned at the County Clerk's
office that Hart had made no application
for a marriage license and" that his wife
had not appeared there to prevent the is
suance of one.
This bears out the supposition that he
was carrying -'out a scheme to get the
â woman's money. ,

SAN BENITO WRECK.
Official Investigation "by the United
States Inspectors of -Steam
â¢ o Vessels.
The investigation of the loss of the
â¢steamer San Benito oh the Mendocino
coast two weeks ago- was beguH yesterday
before the United States Local Inspectors
of -Steam Vessels. The Jhrst witness was
the master of .the ill-fated vessel, who in
substance said that his sworn report of the
disaster should be a part of his'testimony.
lie failed to save bis log as everything was
washed away, his room being entirely
gutted by the sea. When m-aking" the trip
he noticed that thÂ« standard compass, was
correct, but the steering compass and the
bridge compass .Were a little. in error.
After passing Cape Blanco to Cape Mendo
cino there were fresh head winds, squally
at times, with rains and a head saa.
Between the. lapses he ranby.log. 145
miles before changing bis course. Land
was seen several times near the latter cape
from the tops 01 i<e mountains to the.
water. Also saw land near Point Gorda
about9:3ox. M. Was twelve miles off -Cape
Mendocino when the course was changed
at 12:25 o'clock. The Point Arena light
was then in view about five miles distant
and the course was changed more to the
south. A fter this Captain Smith say 3 that
he left the deck in charge of R. Zulling.
About 1:15 or 1:30 A. M. tufl vessel struck.
The first warning of danger was by the
first officer ringing the bell. On eoing^ on
deck tne captain saw land and breakers
close by on the port side. He ordered the
wheel put over and was told that it was.
Immediately after the vessel struck. He
did nut know whether the engines were
stopDed or not at the time. He thought
they wer .< not. There were breakers on
the outside when he first went on deck.
What followed the striking of the ves
sel on the rocks has been already
scribed. Boats were lowed and swamped,
tne steamer broke in two ar.u six men
were drowned. The remainder took to
the rigging. All of the boats were on the
forward part of the vessel. Captain
Smith advised the men to stay by the
steamer, as it was dangerous to launch
the boats. A part of the men were anx
ious to leave and they put out the boats.
After describing the loss of life and the
hardships endured by the survivors while
in. the rigging, the captain was asked the
question : "How do yon account for that
ship being so far out of her course?" -to
which he answered : "'I can account for it
in no other way than by an unusual and
unprecedented current, setting in shore â
per naps partly by careless steering in my
absence."
James Mclntyre, captain of the- Costa
Rica, testified that he left Ban Francisco
on the 20th of November for Departure
Bay, B. C. He did not see the San Be
nito, but testified that in the winter
months there is a northerly set of the cur
rent at the point in question. ' '
The case will go cm again to-day.
BISHOP NEW MAN'S IDEA.
The Able Trelate Present at the Meet
ing of the M. t. Church Exten
â¢_.;:' ..V â¢/ sion Society.
Bisiiop. Newman attended last night's
preliminary meeting of the board of
managers. of the San Francisco Methodist
Episcopal Church Extension Society,
whu-h was held in the lecture-room of the
Simpson ..Memorial Church, and briefly
addressed the board after routine business
had bee'.ri concluded.
â¢The .Ba,n Francisco organization, he
said; ranked with those in. Chicago and,
Rhila,&e4paia, and, in his opinion-, was a
ltttie â  -aheafl of fhe one in New York.
This w-as no flattery oh his part, but a fact.
To his mind, the present organization was
a hopeful' nucleus and promised much for
the future. He considered that it had
already accomplished wonders, and yet,
'as lias- been "intimated, there was much,
.more work for it to do.
Personally he strongly favored the fre
quent.-'holding of mass-meetings for the
purpose of diffusing intelligence among
"the" congregations, at large.
â  Chairman Captain Charles Goodall ac
knowledged the Bishop's complimentary
remarks, bnt suggested that be would be
better able to appreciate the society's
.standing, when he attended .its annual tea
meeting id January. On that occasiqn,
the chairman added, the proceedings
â tfould be characterized by the "feast of
reason and the- flow of soul", hardly pos
sible in a purely, business gathering.
It was decided, in-view of the fact that
the Bishop, has to be in Los Angeles early
in .FebnMTy, to hold the annual tea-meet

the .opening- day' of the twentieth conven

ciation. The sessions are htld in the Sen
ate chamber of the Capitol building. â¢ The'
convention moved slowly during- 'the fore

President Ellwood Cooper w.as in- the
chair, and during nii,.,t orf the day on
either side of him sat William Johnston
of Sacramento and D. J. Fowler of Fres- '
no, who- were elected vice-presidents. N. ;
B. De Long,- s cretary of the State HortU
cultural Society, acted as secretary of the
convention. About 100 fruit-growers are
already in attendance. "â¢ â¢
â An invocation was offered, by Rev. A. C.
Herrick of' the Baptist churoh. 'He
prayed that favoring providence rest oU
the fruit-growers and give them wisdom
from which great prosperity might come
to. California.
.He also invoked the favor of the God of
N ations in behalf of the Cubans who were
struggling for their liberty as did the fore
fathers of this nation.
.Mayor Hubbard delivered an. address of
welcome on behalf of the citizens of Sac
ramento. He said. that Sacramento, being
in the midst of a great fruit-crowing sec*
tion, was deeply interested in tne work of
the convention, for upon the success of
the orchards did the prosperity of the city
largely depend. It was. an easy thing to
rai^e fruits in California, bat tp raise and
market them profitably required wisdom,
experience aod co-operation.
. "From experiments which others have
tried you can show our growers how to
avoid mistakes and. great losses. The
fruit-growing industry has grown to .such
proportions In this State that legislation is
needed, and you are expected to prepare
and present to the Legislature these mat
ters, so thai beneficial laws may be en
acted," he said.
In hi? annual address president Cooper
said the removal of the State Board from
San Francisco to Sacramento, where Leg
islators could be more conversant with
the work, was believed advantageous.
â¢ Th c work of the board had progressed,
-.notwithstanding the lack of the usual as
sistance from the State. Many donations
had been made and other assistance given,
which would enable.the board to make a
creditable showing for the year.
He suggested that the Legislature pass
some radical law. against the growing
"tramp danger."
'â¢The beneficial wort," he said, "that
has bee-n. accomplished! by the ladybirds
brought from Australia through the
medium of Albert Koe'bele, the. discoverer,,
is of sufficient importance to justify fur
ther expenditure in that direc.tiou.
"As intelligent fruit-growers, it is our
duty to continue Investigation. The
greatest loss to the cultivator is the de
struction of his crops 5y fnsect enemies.
It has been stated that the annual loss by
in-ect pests alone in the United States
a-mounts to over $300,000,000.
"Our experience in fighting the Icerya
Purchasii, commoply called the white
cottony cushioned scale, and the Coccus
Oleo, known as the black scale, should be
sufficient to convince us of-our inability to
cope with these terrible pests.
"Now 'that we have a parasite, obtained
by the expenditure of an insignificant
sum, tdHt will forever relieve us from any
further fear of loss in this direction, we
should be very derelict of duty to
rest under the certainty of the
approach of myriads of other
enemies that may be equally dangerous
and may baffle all our efforts in
artificial remedies to destroy them.
In Santa Barbara County the fruit
growers have practically abandoned
all spraying and fumigating, excepting
a few persons who have continued to fight
in this way for â¢ want of faith
and patience. Results, however, will
poon bring about a discontinuance lor the
reason that the orchards where the para
sites have been colonized are better grown
and produce more fruit and of finer ap
pearance than the orchards wnere spray
ing and fumigating have been resorted
to."
President Cooper recommended the em
ployment of Albert Koebele to visit every
quarter of the earth where parasites which
prey on and destroy the enemies of the
products of the soil could be procured
and that the fruit-growers should see that
the Legislature made au appropriation.
The Governor was with the fruit-growers,
but both thought the growers should pay
for the colonies of parasites sent to them.
The last lew years had not been profit
able ones to fruit-growers. He recom
mended that the growers unite and sell no
<ruit to middlemen or anybody who did
not give a fair profit to the producer.
He approved the idea of establishing
houses in the East, managed by fruit
growers, and being independent of mid
dlemen.
At the afternoon session the following
committee, appointments by the chair,
were announced:
Resolutionsâ John Marketer of Sonoma, P. J.
Shields of Sonoma, R. C. Kolls of Ynba City,
B. E. Hutchinson of Fresno, P. B. Armstrong

Favorable responses were read by the
secretary from California members in
Congress in regard to lending assistance to
the memorials passed at the last conven
tion of the fruit-growers, urging the
construction of thÂ«- Nicaragua canal, and
asking to share n the distribution of beet
seed and tobacco seed. It was tound thai
the distribution of the seed had oeen
slopped.
General N. P. Chipman read an enter
taining as well as a valuable paper on the
nssigned topic: "Should Tree Planting
Be Encouraged or Discouraged? If So,
What Kinds, Varieties, etc.?"
He said that in the last six years ex
ports of fruit had doubled. The greatest
increase was in citrus fruits which had
been trebled, with the exception of
walnuts, and all other besides citrus vari
eties had increased about 100 per cent.
The nation's popnlation bad increased
7,000,000 in six years, and in 1895 the peo
ple ate twice as'mucb California fruit as in
1890. All this, too, notwithstanding the
hard times.
The consumption of fruit was about
nine to ten pounds per capita. He
thought that when prosperity returned
the people would consume more fruit and
possibiy'pay more for it.
He advised the planting of diversified
fruits, and spoke against the middleman
being allowed to control the price. He
suggested that the growers stop worrying
about the false question of overproduction,
saying that the" real qu^s'tion was a com
mtfrcial one, and that the frnit-growers
must stand or fall together.
General Chipman's paper was heartily
applatfded.
W. H. Hammon, Forecast Official of
San Francisco, delivered an address on
the subject, "Protecting Orchards from
Frost," v/hich was also applauded..
His remarks are emoodied in a" pam
phlet which the State Board of Horticul-.
ture lias already had printed for distribr
tion under the title of bulletin No. 70.
This subject brought out mora discussion
than .any other of. the day.

P. B. Armstrong of Acampo, presi

A committee comprising John. Rock of

Davisville and G. E. Lawr.ence of Lodi
had prepared the. memorial.- '
Th> fruit- LTpwers' convention referred
the memorial to the following committee
on tariff legislation, appointed especially
.for the purpose, the iruit-erowers them

The fruitgrowers' convention then ad
journed for the day. . .-':.
Late in the afternoon the almond-grow
lers met and discussed the proposition of
forming an organization of their own,,
which had been rather favorably regarded
by-a number present at the forernoon ses
sion.
General Chipman and others attended
the session % and they spoke advisingly
against any. organization which might be
regnrded as secedi.ng or branching out too
independently from the main organization
of the lruit-^rowers, especially â¢ as they
bad identical Congressional aims, and
from the. additional fact that all almond
raisers are also grov.ers of fruit. It was
finally decided not to effect a permanent
organization.
â¢ The reception in the Senate chamber by
the Chamber of Commerce and State offi
cers to tbe iruil-growers will take place
to-morrow evening. . â¢
. The. fruit-growers' committee on tariff
legislation had a lengtny session to-ni-ht.

AN IMPORTANT SALE,
A Long Line of Uncalled-Fur
Garments Being Sold at 40
Per Gent Discount.
The Columbian Woolen Mills, S. N.
Wood & Co, Have Inaugurated a
Sale on Eastern P<ans.
Mr. Meyer Wood of the Columbian
Woolen Mills, S. N. Wood & Co., returned
to this City from the East a few days ago,
where he had been for tbe past month ar
ranging with his Eastern aeencies for an
extensive and novel sale of men's clothing;
which commenced on Monday at their
bead workshop. 541 Market street, directly
opposite Sansome, and which will be con
ducted on a system Quite common in the
Eastern cities, but htretoiore unknown in
California.
The sale in question consists of uncalled
for garments, comprising a collection of
suits and overcoats oi all descriptions and
sizes, gathered from the Eastern branches
of the Columbian Woolen Mills, as weli as
from the several agencies of the firm in
San Francisco, Oakland and throughout
this State. It is the custom of many of
the large Eastern firms, with several
branches, to hold a clearance sale once a
year of garments that have been ordered
and uncalled for, and the Columbian
Woolen Mills propose to inaugurate this
system of yearly Clearances of their several
stores throughout the country at their
dead workshop, 541 Market street.
Besides the many neat and nobby gar
ments which accumulate at their large
storesjdurinp tbe year the lucky purchasers
at clearance sales have the advantage also
of a great rea action in price, which of
course is allowed in order to facilitate a
quick and complete sale. In speaking of
sales of this character Mr. Meyer Wood of
the Columbian Woolen Mills had the fol
lowing to say:
"It has been our custom to hold these
clearance sales of nncalled-for uoods each
year in either one of our Ne-qr York stores,
but this year we have decided to conduct
the sale in San Francisco and give tbe
public here an opportunity they have
never had before to purchase suits and
overcoats of superior quality, as weil as of
tbe finest workmanship, at a reduction of
40 per cent on the original price. The goods
we are to sell accumulate on our hands by
reason of various causes. They are clothes
which have been ordered but never sold,
for many reasons. Sometimes, for in
stance, we fail to finish a suit of clothes,
an overcoat, or some other Rarment on
time, and if the purchaser refuses to com
plete the bargain he can, of course, do so,
and this way it is left on our Hands. Sick
ness and various other emergencies on the
part of purchasers in a like manner leaves
on our hands at the end of each year hun
dreds of garments, and it is ior thiÂ« rea
son we have adopted, as is the custom of
other. larjie Eastern firms, these annual
clearance sales of uncalled-for suits, over
coats and other garments, which are sold
40 percent below the original price."

PROMINENT EDUCATOR .
Dr. IT. T. Harris, the Hegelian Scholar,
. Will Soon Be Hereâ He Will De
liver Several Lectures.
California will soon be honored with a
somewhat prolonged visit and a number
of philosophical lectures on educational
topics by JJr. W. T. Harris, United States
Commissioner of Education, who is known
all over the world as the greatest living
Hegelian scholar.
The eminent educator will arrive in
Berkeley on December 16 and will deliver
two or three lectures for the Philosopical
Union, of which Professor Howison is
president. The first lecture will be on
December 18 and the others will follow
soon. It is believed that his . discourses
will prove even more interesting than
were tbe famous lectures of Josiah Royce
of Harvard last year. He is everywhere
recognized as the king of Hegelian schol
ars and as the greatest of American edu
ca.iors. It was for this reason that he was
made Commissioner of Education for the
United States.
During his sojourn in tbe Stale Dr.
Harris will travel and study the prevail
ing educational system and will lecture at
San Jose during the State Teachers' As
sociation, which will last from the 28th to
the 31st.
In addition to his regular educational
work Dr. Harris has made a reputation
as a writer on economics and social sci
ence. His reply to Henry George is re
garded as one of the ablest ever set forth
in answer to the single-tax idea.
Dr. Harris attended Yale as a young
man and afterward went West, spending
fourteen years as Superintendent of
Schools in St. Louis. It was there that he
made a worldwide reputation by reason
of his erudition and originality while
editing the Journal of Speculative Phil
osophy. He finally resigned his position
and made his home in Concord, Mass.,
where be found a .coneenial atmosphere
for pursuing his philosophical investiga
tions.
President Harrison appointed him Na
tional Commissioner of Education and he
has held that position evei since, being
continued in office by president Cleveland.
The Bureau of Education, under his direc
tion, has periormed a great deal of valua
ble work, undertaking exhaustive com
parative stnJies of American and Euro
pean educational methods and disseminat
ing much valuable information.
Since 1867 Dr. Harris has been editor of
the Journal of Speculative Philosophy.
He has published a translation of the
most important portions of Hegel's Logic,
and it is his commentary on a portion of
this the U C. Philosophical Union has
been studying.
THE HUDELSON TRIAL.
Defendant Arraigned and the Case Set
fur Trial To- Morrow Morning.
On account of tbe absence of Georee A.
Knight, the libel suit against B. F. Hudel
son, in which D. B. Woodworth is the
com plaining witness, was postjoned by
Police Judge Campbell yesterday morn
ing until the same hour Thursday morn

for Mr. Knight and warned the case to gro

bell declared that he i ad been waiting for
Mr. Knight for a year in another case, and
that be could not extend the same leniency
in this.
Judge Campbell also insisted that the

.. A Master of Medicine and Surgery.
' There has probably never been -a phy
sician or surgeon in San Francisco who
whs so liberally patronized by the sick and
suffering, and at tbe same time so highly
praised by them, as the distinguished
specialist, Doctor Cook, whose offices are
permanently located at 865 Market stre*et.
His private consultation rooms are daily
visited by people not only of Ban.Fran
cisco, but from all over the West They
come from cv.cry station of life. Among
them are bankers, lawyers, merchants,
mechanics, ministers, farmers, laborers
and literary gentlemen, many of whom
have repeatedly sought relief from other
physicians, and have repeatedly met with
disappointments. .
While they'go to. Doctor Cook' fall of
disease and despondency, they come away
from him full of hope, confidence and joy,
and feeling better in every way. From
that very hour they begin to permanently
improve. What the great specialist does
to them, or the kind of treatment he ad
ministers to them, is a secret known only
to himself â a secret upon which his re
markable success is founded. '
The vast volumes of testimonials in
Doctor Cook's possession are the strongest
and most convincing proof of his ability
to combat and conquer all tbe different
diseases that come within his specially.
They show that he has cured numberless
cases of female complaints, men's private
ailments, rheumatism, chronic catarrh,
blood and skin diseases and functional
diseases of the heart, lungs, liver, stom
ach, kidneys, bladder and urinary organs.
But Doctor Cook's special treatment for
lost manhood and its many attending ail
ments of physical, mental and sexual
weakness, is the crowning glory of nis pro
fessional career. It is a treatment known
to no other physician in America. It is
such a hand that O'Brien could scarcely
decipher it. -Woodworth, who api ears as
bis own attorney, assisting the Prosecut
ing Attorney, undertook to explain to
him. Attorney Jordan called the court's
attention to the fact, and said he thought
the interpreter should be sworn.
Judge Campbell then took the faulty
document and himself slowly read it
through. "This complaint will not hold,"
said his Honor; "it does not clearly
specify a crime or the date of its commis
sion."
Woodworth undertook to argue the mat
ter. He declared that it was only neces
sary in this preliminary proceeding to
show that a crime bad probably been
committed, and declared t at the Su
preme Court had recently so decided.
"It tbe Supreme Court says any such
thing I shall have to overrule the Sunreme
Court," said Judge Campbell. '"That is
the province of the Grand Jury. I shall
undertake to go further into the merits of
this case than that. At all events this
complaint is not go d and a new one will
have to be made before this case goes on.
"That dismisses this case then," said
Attorney Jordan.
"No it does not," said Judge Campbell,
"tbe exceptions to the complaint are
taken by the court." Turning to Wood
worth, however, he advised him to take
out another warrant with the new com
plaint in order to be safe.
Following is the language of the com
plaint, as prepared by Woodworth, with
which tbe court found fault:
At the times to-wit between the 10th day of
April and 10th dRy of repiember, 1896, in the

crime of criminal libel which offenses are

. -THE CALL SPEAK 3 FOR ALL. â
According to Judee MeKenna thie Rail
road Commission is sufficiently constitu
tional to draw salaries, but it cannot re
duce freight rates.
There is but one sure way oi' reducing
freight rates in California and that is to
break the cinch of the monopoly by build
ing competing roads.
. Tax reform in lowa is a burning isrfue
for the State has a deficit of $500,000 to
meet and there is no chance of postponing
the question tb some other eve.
It ia admitted that Major McKmley can
construct his Cabinet himself, but many
people seem to think it incumbent upon
them to tell him how to select the timber.
It is an ill wind that blows nobody, good,
for even the Eastern blizzards have bene
fited gome people of that section by in
ducing them to start for California at once.
Judge McKenna's decision that the
Southern. Pacific Company could not re
duce grain rates 8 per cent without ruin
will make the people along the line of the
"Valley road smile.
The monetary conference which assem
bled in Indianapolis yesterday will hardly
attract any great-degree of public interest.
It is to the next Congress the people look
for the settlement of tnat question.
Up to this time nine Californians have
been mentioned for a place in McKinley's
Cabinet. The President-elect will take
notice, therefore, that we have the timber
to fit into any position where he happens
to need it.
The almond-growers of California have
acted wisely in beginning at once a move
ment to procure a proper protection for
their industry and the growers of other
products in California might well imitate
their example.
Ex-Secretary Foster declares that Sena
tor Sherman and not Mr. Hanna should
represent Ohio in tbe Cabinet, but as Mr.
Foster is somewhat desirous of Sherman's
seat in the Senate his view of the situation
is evidently cut on the bias.
The news of yesterday gave the names
of three additional manufacturing estab
lishments which have started work after
having been closed during the depression,
and it will be seen the movement toward
prosperity Keeps steadily along.
The capture of Guayamaro by the Cu
bans has compelled Weyler to change his
plan of campaign, but he has sufficient
versatility to do so with promptness. Be
fore the capture he was marching for
ward aud now he is marching back.
The Bakersfield Californian announced
a short time ago that, owing to a revival
of business, it would have to issue a six
page paper in order to Keep pace with tbe
demand for advertising. It found, how
ever, even within a short time, that it would
have to issue an eight-page paper. In a
literal sense that means business. Bak
ersfield is evidently determined to take
the lead.
The proposed construction of a railroad
to connect the Cancftliau Pacific with tbe
gold fields in the northwestern part of
British Columbia will emphasize the need
of a speedy settlement of the controversy
over the Alaskan boundary. It is barely
possible tte Canadians may take a notion
to run their railroad into Alaskan terri
tory and claim it as theirs if the line is not
drawn before they get to it.
An irdustry wftich is likely to have a
large development in California is that of
tobacco-growing. Enough has been done
to show that tobacco can be cultivated
with profit in many sections of the State,
and the demand for it in tbe Union is
large enough to justify a vast increase in
the production. It will be worth while for
farmers in many sections of the State to
devote a portion of their land and their
energies to this crop, for the prospects are
that it will prove more than ordinarily
remunerative.
Road improvement is receiving a large
amoupt of attention from the newspapers
of many of the interior counties, and
many suggestions of value on tbe subject
have been put forward. It ia certain that
several propositions looking to the pro
motion of good roads in the State will be
submitted to the next Legislature, and
thechances are we shall have some im
portant legislation on the subject. The
Call has no particular plan to advance,
but will cordially support any which
promises to result in good to the common
wealth. .Let the discussion go on. The
subject is an important one, and it is cer
tainly high time to take some action con
cerning it. ,
The Marysville Democrat gives but a
lukewarm support to the movement for
the appointment of a Secretary of Mines
and Mining, and rays that even if such an
officer could be appointed, it is by no
means certain a Western man would gat
the place. This is not the proper way to
look at the subject. The object Wo are
striving for is not to get a Cabinet posi
tion for a Western man, bat the estab
lishment of a National department which
will take care of the great mining indus
try in which the West is so largely inter
ested. It matters not whether tbe Secre
tary hails from the East or from the West,
no long as he gives his time to the pro
motion of an industry which has too long
been neglected by the General Govern
ment.
A USELESS COMMISSION.
The decision of Judge McKenna, when
carefully considered by the people of Cali
fornia, will be" found to dave placed the
Railroad Commission in the position of a
leÂ«Â»al, but otherwise useless and expensive
luxury. As such the duty of the next
Legislature is plain and unmistakable.
It should submit a constitutional amend
ment to the people, either abolishing the
commission entirely or so reforming its
function* as to make it serviceable to the
people of California.*
The utter uselessness of the commission
has been made doubly apparent by Judge
McKenna's decision. It has been ia ex
istence as a department of the- Slate gov
ernment for the past sixteen years, during
which time there have been rive different
sets-of Commissioners elected by tb.e peo
ple. If there has been anything of real
service rendered to California by the Rail
road Commission during all these years it
has not been discovered. There has never
been an election since the commission
was created in which the people.of Cali
fornia jiave not expressed "their -disap
proval of thfl outgoing board and mani
fested their ho,pe of something bettor
from the incoming one.
These expressions; at the time of the
.State election in 1894 took the -form of an
express effort to pledge -aspirants for the
office of Railroad .Commissioner to*a posi
tive and definite reduction, in freight
schedule's. Upon their election every
member of the commission manifested an
apparent anxiety to redeem that pledge. '
However earnest 'the purposes "of the
commission may have been, the decision
of Judge McKenna has made them vain,
and has gone further ia so limiting the
powers of the commission as to make all
future purposes and efforts in a like direc
tion equally vain.
The Commissioners are declared to have
power to- hear complaints, to take testi
mony and render thereona judgment re
ducing freights ana fares, but at the same
time the right has been accorded the rail
road companies to appeal from the Judg
ment of the commission to. the Federal
courts, and there, upon new evidence and
upon an entirely different showing* from
that presented to the â¢commission, to seek
and in, all probability to obtain a reyersal
of its decree. This it will be seen at once
removes everything but .the mere sem
'bkmce of power from the commission and
leaves it in a position* where transporta
tion companies may snap their fingers at
its processes' and orders and nullify its at
tempted action whenever it may. chance to
be unsatisfactory to them.
In addition to Deing? useless, body, the
Railroad Commission is a. most expensive
one. It costs the State of California in
the salaries of its members and of their
.clerks and assistants not less than $.16,000
a year. It is the plain duty of the next
Legislature either to put a stop tb this ex
pense by abolishing the commission, or, by
some reform in its powers and duties, to
get for the State an adequate return for
this large annual outlay. The decision of
Judge McKenna lays this imperative obli
gation upon the next Legislature, and the
people of California, who have just been
judicially informed upon the subject,
should see to it that the Legislature per
forms its duty in this regard.
THE MONETARY CONFEEENCE.
The Monetary Conference which assem
bled at Indianapolis yesterday will hardly
attract much attention from the country
generally, no matter how capable may
be tbe men who engage in it. The
people have ejected .a President and a
Congress to deal with the monetary prob
lems, and they are "not Jik'ely to give any
great consideration to- anything- whicn
may be said- or done by a volunteer con
vention on the subject. -
From the tone of the call for this con
ference it seems. to be the beginning of an
agitation for the retirement of greenbacks.
In other words, it is an attempt to revive
tbe platform of the Indianacolis conven
tion on which Palmer and Buckner were
nominated. The conference, therefore, is
likely to be composed of the advocates of
the Cleveland monetary policy, and it is
probable that whatever resolutions it
adopts will be in accordance therewith.
It is of course impossible to predict what
course will be followed by the conference,
since the men who are to take part in it are
drawn from boards of trade and are not
widely known. Their convictions on the
subject, therefore, are largely matters of
speculation. It is possible tha-t those who
called the conference may not be able to
control its proceedings, and the resolu
tions adopted may be quite different from
what was expected by those who designed
tbe gathering. This uncertainty is tbe
only thing which gives a degree of interest
to the assembly.
It was the intention of the promoters
of the plan to make the conference simply
a preliminary to a Jarger one to be held
later on. Whether this plan is carried
out will depend of course on how the
present conference acts. If it should fol
low the programme we may expect an
other convention to be called for, and an
active agitation for the retirement of
greenbacks to be begun. If, however, the
conference breaks away from the leaders,
the work will probably end with its ad
journment.
The country pretty well understands by
this time that the Cleveland-theory of the
"endless chain" is not true. The cam
paign of education Which ended in the re
cent election amply demonstrated the fact
that the drain on the gold reserve was
caused not so much by our financial sys
tem as by the tariff system which fur
nished a revenue inadequate to tbe needs
of the Government. A Republican tariff
will materially alter all the circumstances
of the case, and tbe demand for the re
tirement of greenbacks which Cleveland
so diligently promoted will, in all proba
bility, end with the ending of the deficit
tariff.
PROTECTION FOR ALMONDS.
The almond-growers of California have
acted wisely in beginning at once the
movement to procure from the National
Government an adequate protection for
the products of their industry. They
have taken advantage of tbe annual con
ventfon of the btate Fruit Growers' Asso
ciation at Sacramento to hold a prelimi
nary convention of their own and take
steps for the promotion of the needed
legislation.
In a memorial to Congress the almond
growers set forth that the climate and soil
of California and other States on tbe Pa
cific Coast are adapted to the growth of
the almond, and that the tree is now be
ing extensively cultivated. They repre
sent further that, owing to the great com
petition of foreign-grown almonds sold in
our home market and the low tariff
on tne imported almond, there is no
profit for the home product. The memo
rial states that there is scarcely an
almond-grower in California who has
made the slightest percentage of profit in
the last ten years, and asserts that the busi
ness has been conducted at a loss and that
tbe loss will continue until the tariff on
imported almonds is revised to meet the
exigencies of the industry.
It is claimed by the growers that the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1896.
selling price of almonds is from 10 to 12
cents a pound, and they desire tbe tariff
on foreign almonds increased from 5 to 6
cents a pound. They ask for a higher
tariff than that fixed by the McKinley
bill. The request is founded on good rea
sons and certainly deserves favorable con
sideration from Congress when the work
oi tariff reform begins.
There are two factors in tne problem of
the almond industry which give an ad
vantage to the foreign producer over the
Galifornian. One is tbe rate of wages paid
in the cultivation and harvesting of tne
crop, and the other is the rate of trans
portation to the Eastern market. In Cali
fornia the average wasres of persons em
ployed in the almond industry is $1 a day,
while in Europe it is only 16 cents a day.
The European, moreover, sends his crop
to New York by the cheap transportation
of ocean steamers, while the California
crop has to pay^the high rates fixed by the
railroads. These factors are sufficient to
overcome every advantage which Califor
nia has of soil and climate, and leave the
industry in this State helpless to compete
with that of the foreign producer.
A' consideration of these facis would be
sufficient to convince all genuine protec
tionists of the justice of tbe request.which
the almond-growers nave put forward.
Nevertheless, it was an act of wisdom on
their part to begin an agitation on the
subject at once. The producers of other
crops in California may well profit by this
example. The sooner we begin to put for
ward oar claims for protection, the more
certain we are to attain success. Nothing
can be lost by starting early, while delay
may prove disastrous in tbe extreme. '
THE TOURIST SEASON.
According to reports from Chicago, tbe
severity of the blizzard in the East has
greatly stimulated the rush of travel to
California. As a rule, the tourists do not
begin to come into the State in large num
bers until after the holidays, but the re
cent cold snap has induced thousands of
people to abandon the idea of spending
Christmas at home in the snowdrifts and
to start at once for the land of winter sun
shine. * â¢
The report from Chicago says: "In
quirjes at the offices of all the leading
lines develop the fact that hundreds of
Chicago people are' leaving for the balmy
climate of the Pacific Coast. Two lines
say that all tne berths on two different
trains were engaged for that night and
reservations were being received fast.
There are people at all the ticket-offices
lined up at the counter buying tickets and
reserving berths."
The coming of these tourists into the
State will probably mean something more
than good business for the hotels. It is
fair to assume that among those who come
out this winter there will be many who
will seek something more than a tem
porary escape from the blizzard season.
Not a few of those who come into the
State will come here with tbe intention of
making permanent homes for themselves.
We may, therefore, count on an incoming
of home-seekers and settlers as well as of
passipg tourists. â¢
There has never been In late years a
better opportunity for Home-seekers to
come to California than at this season.
Land prices at the present time are down
to a bedrock basis. There is not a symp
tom of a boom in' any portion of the State.
The man who buys land in California to
day will obtain it for exactly what it is
worth to-day. 'He will not have to dis
count the future. He will not be expected
to pay for rural land a price dependent
upon the supposition that a great city will
eventually be constructed on it.
This fact, we believe, is fairly mtder
srood in tbe East. The people of that sec
tion are aware that in California, as
everywhere else, the long depression- of
the past three years has had the effect of
bringing .all. prices down to the level of
legitimate business propositions. There
is no longer any speculation in California
real estate. The home-seeker or the in-
vestor will get His moneys worth : every
time ana' can count on a sure profit from
the start.
TEE POOLROOMS.
After long delay the Board of Supervi
sors has passed to print the much dis
cussed poolroom ordinance, and there is
now a reasonable hope it will be enacted
into law, and put an end to an evil which
has too long been tolerated in San Fran
cisco.
The measure was framed with great
care and was elaborately argued and dis
cussed at the time when it was first pio
posed to the board. Reduced to its last
analysis it prohibits all forms of betting
money or anything else on horseraces
conducted within the limits of San Fran
cisco, except within the confines of the
racetrack. It therefore closes up the
downtown poolrooms and tends to re
move one of the greatest sources of evil
which exist among us.
At the time the ordinanoe was pro
posed The Call gave it the most cordial
support anrl repeatedly urged its passage
in the imprests of morality and public
welfare. V/e pointed out that these down
town poolroor s are a constant source of
temptation to the youth of the City and
that many of tbe patrons of such estab
lishments were little more than - boys".
We repeatedly called attention to the
evils resulting from the maintenance -of
such places within the City and specified
many instances of injury occasioned by
them.
Every argument which was urged in
favor of the ordinance at that time could
be urged again. The evils which existed
then are equally potent now. Neverthe
less we believe it will not be necessary to
go over the old ground. The vote by
which the ordinance was passed to print
was unanimous, and there is reason for
believing the opposition to it has practi
cally come to an end.
When tbe ordinance is enacted the peo
ple of San Francisco can congratulate
themselves on having taken one long step
forward, in the direction of reform. One
great evil which has lone; been tolerated
will be in a fair way of removal from tbe
City. There can be no doubt that the
officers of the law will be vigilant in en
forcing the ordinance and it will be effect
ive at once. This will be a victory for
good government and the better element
of the people, which will encourage far
ther effort in the same direction. Let the
good work *ro on.

ONE SHOT DID IT.
Wonderful- Work Accomplished â  by the
i, Dynamite Ouna in Cuba. Â :';.
Lieutenant Ramos of the Cuban service ar
rived in New York the other day, and in an
interview published in the Herald gave an in
teresting account of the wonderful dynamite
gun of which he bad charge while with
Maceo's army. The gun, as he describes, is
about 6 feet in length and weighs 250 pounds.
The dynamite gun is formed of three parallel
barrels. The right tube holds a cartridge of
smokeless powder; the left tube confines com
pressed air, and the center holds the iron pro
jectile, in which is the explosive gelatineâ
which has three times the force of ordinary
dynamite. When the cartridge is exploded in
the right barrel of the eun It sets free the com
pressed air in the left barrel, which rushes sud
denly into the center barrel, and hurls the
projectile at the enemy. When this projectile
strikes, it explodes with tremendous force,
,not only destroying human life, but uprooting
THE DYNAMITE .GUN.
trees and tearing loose the ground and rocks.
The gun In the hand of a good gunner can
do effective work at the distance of a mile,
though the best range for certain work is half
of that distance. When to this is added the
certainty of aim of which the gun is capable
in expert hands, and ' the effect of the
explosion of the projectile, the result when It
strikes in the midst of a body of trooos can be
imagined.
The work done by the gun in battle is thus
described: "It was on the 13th of the month
that we met two Spanish columns, which
meant a battle with even forces. As we
reached a hilltop overlooking a narrow valley
we saw the Spaniards on top of the next hill,
only a auarter of a mile away. They were at
'work throwing up a line of fortifications.
"A few shots were exchanged, when Maceo
ordered our gun iorward and had it trained
on the enemy. He stood by the piece and ob
served us closely as we prepared to fire, and
when the report was heard he watched the re
sult with the deepest interest.
"The aim was too low and tho shot fell short
of its mark. No one was Injured, but the
effect of the explosion on the gronn'd where it
struck apparently astoniÃhed the Spaniards,
for they ceased firing for several minutes.
"During those minutes we were preparing for
the second shot. The muzzle of the gun was
raised a little when all was in readiness and tbe
command to fire was given. This time the aim
was perfect and the deadly -project'le was
thrown over the brow of the hill and into the
very midst of the Spanish troops. The explo
sion brought consternation. The shot bid
done its frightful work, and the Spaniards,
disappearing from sight, did not fire another
gun that night.
"We waited for morning to renew the battle,
but as soon as it was light the enemy fired
one bombshell and then retreated. The battle
was won by that one shot from our gun."

PROSPERITY AND CONFIDENCE.
Indianapolis Journal.
After all, the best assurance of better times
is not in the number of establishments which
have started work since the election, though
this is an important feature, but in the restor
ation of confidence, which insures a steady,
progressive and healthy revival of business of
all kinds as rapidly as the country can adjust
itself to the new condition. What was needed
above everything else was the restoration of
confidence. The free-silver' apitation, the
threat of a debased and fluctuating currency
and Bryan's vicious candidacy had destroyed
confidence to such an extent that any revival
of prosperity was impossible while that con
dition continued. If Bryan had been elected
it would not only have continued, but would
have been immeasurably aggravated. The
election of MeKlnley has introduced condi
tions under which the return of prosperity is
absolutely assured, -and, while it may not
come all at once or maintain the pace of the
first few days after tbe election, it is none the
less sure to come. Let us labor and wait, have
confidence and'be patient. . -.' '

Letters From the People.
CITY GOVERNMENT.
Suggestions for the Proposed Com
- t >â¢- .'. mittee of One Hundred.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Mr I Phelan, our Mayor-elect," has a rare op
portunity to serve the \ City, in the â¢ appoint
ment of the committee of one hundred to
formulate a new charter for the government
of our City, which is to serve as a sort of plat
form on . which we are ultima tely to elect a
committee of fifteen freeholders who will
prepare the charter â  for submission to . the
electors ot ;. the City for their adoption :or , re
jection. '- The committee will be large enough
to encb'.e Mr. Phelan -to* make it fairly and
truly representative of all the people in thU
City, and if ', they are honestly represented in
the committee, with i ample * time given the
committee for deliberation; aod discussion,
: there ; Is: little j room for "doubt that a good
charter will.be agreed upon by this commltteo
of one hundred and that will probaDly insure
its adoption by a vote of the people.
Assuming that a genuinely representative
committee will be appointed, as I believe it
will be, I have a few suggestions to make for
the consideration of such committee. , I nave
'devoted the leisure time of a week to a volume
of 385 pages on "Municipal Government â¢ in
"Great-Britain," by Albert Shaw, the versatile
American editor .of The Review of Reviews,
and in this large volume by Mr. Shaw I have
found such vast stores of practical and -ex
tremely interesting information, which
broadens one's views as to the functions and
possibilities of city government, that I should
feel myself derelict in duty as a citizen should
1 fail to commend it without stint tp the
committee and to all citizens desirous of se
curing good government, who may not have
seen the book. - ' '
Let me pause here lor g enough -to say that
I am not enamored of anything English, yon
' know, by any: manner oi means. Indeed, I
know of nothing relating to Government which
I think all American citizens should reject w.ith.
deeper detestation than the British system of
finance so dear to the hearts of GroverÂ£leve
land, John Sherman and all other friends of
the single gold standard; : but I cau : only pity
the niau whose prejudices darken, his judg
ment and make him incapable of considering
.any proposition or system on its merits.' ..
li I shall succeed In giving a lair summary
of thb" contents of Mr. Shaw's book in this
letter I shall certainly render a valuable
service io hundreds |of San Francisco \ readers
of ThÂ« CALL.who feel a profound interest in
the movement to secure good government â
â¢the best government attainableâ for our fair
â¢â¢City. â¢ And I desire especially to address my
self to those-who poj the taxes, aid more par
ticularly to those who pay larger sums to the
tax-collector; for it seems to me that If tax
payers should ever find out what has been
done- iii Glasgow or Manchester or Birming
ham or London they would never rest sat
isfied a day until the fundamental principles
of these cities, and more particularly of Glas
gow, have â  become incorporated in â  our own
system of municipal government. â¢
. Mr. Shaw devotes the introductory, chapter
of his book to the growth and problems of
modern , cities, and no intelligent , man Â or,
woman can read that single chapter without
gaining broader and more cheering views of
the future of our city populations, for all ten
-dene? to pessimism will give place to rational
optimism, with a corresponding purpose to
lend a hand in dispelling the Ignorance which
beclouds the minds 'of the ; citizens who now
.submit to the misgovernment of our Ameri
â can cities. .True,' there Is a formidable amouot
of conceit in the average American who bar
.confined his reading to the daily nowspaper
and his study of municipal government to the
municipal reports: but even a mail's conceit
Mill yield to his pecuniary welfare, for every
man is rather ashamed of his conceit when
he fluds that it blinds him to his own interests
and makes him ridiculous before Intelligent
people. . â¢ 'â  ' â¢â¢* -â â  "- . â¢
In. the second chapter we have an account of
the rise of British towns, the reform acts and
the- municipal code occupying eighteen pages.
It affords a striking and instructive â¢ contrast
to'our own towns and cities which often reach
an astonishing growth in a decade, made up
of a conglomerate population, - which renders
the problem of government a matter of pro
foifnd importance. The third chapter presents
us with the -British system of municipal gov
ernment in full operation, t>ccupylng thirty
pages', and giviug us a most satisfactory con
ception of the functions and working of the
system. â â 'â  .:â â¢.â ,;..â ;... ...-,; â ;."-â  â¢.â¢'â¢'
The fourth chapter is styled "A Study of
Glasgow," and seventy-six pages are given to
the most notable and successiu.l city govern
ment in the world in ancient or modern !
.'times, a city of about three-quarters of i a mil- j
lion â  people," who have actually solved tho'
problem *.. of .\ securing the n best t municipal <
government ever known, and this "next year j
, they will -collect no taxes amd will have no
Assessor .or ; Tax Collector. ' It will be impos- "
tibjie to do justice to this chapter without de
voting half a column to it, which I may do at
another time. "."â 'â¢ ... .
-The fifth chapter contains a graphic review
of Manchester's municipal activities, and the '
sixth relates to the civic lffe a'ud expansion of
â¢ Birmingham; the seventh takes up * the
social activities of Britisn tefwns, a very in
structive chapter ; the eighth occupies , forty
one . pages â  aevoted to the government ;, of
London, and the ninth reviews metropolitan
tasks and problems. There is a valuable ' ap
pendix of fifty page- I*,1 *, with an elaborate and
excellent index, which makes the contents of
the book â¢ instantly available on any > point.
This book is of first importance to those Who
are trying to make a city charter. ' -

AN ALABAMA REFORMER.
New York sjun.
There iÂ« somebody in Alabama who has a
genius for reform and evidently has set up ol
nights for months for the purpose of finding j
evils to reform. The result of these long ses- j
sions of thought has just appeared, and will
not disappoint the high expectations of the
public. The reformer lias prepared a bill pro
hibiting a woman from wearing a shift, waist
or any other piece of raiment which copies the
garb of man. There can be nothing more im
portant for the Alabama Legislature to do than
to pass a law in restraint of the shirt waist. It
does not appear what specific injury that gar
ment inflici.s upon the sens.b.litits of Ala
bama, but in tnese matters It is betier to trust
to the reformer. Clearly he withes to asso
ciate bis name with a great measure, to go
down to history as tha destroyer of a great evil,
and Alabama is so lortunate that no greater
evil than this shirt waist is In sight. When
the law is passed, the total and instant disap
pearance ot ihe prohibited article may be ex
pected. Will any wom^n in Alabama wish or
dare to wear a shirt waisi after the Legislature,
in tne plenitude of its wisdom, has lorDidden
the use of that thing? Will not every woman
in Alabama be struck more forcibly than ever
with the superiority ot legislating man, and
see the wickedness of trying to imitate the
clothes of such a magnificent creature? Oh,
this Alabama lawgiver knows the feminine
nature. He has no doubt of the success ol his
plan. He must be a great man, and we should
like to have his picture.

STOP-OVER RIGHTS

â¢ That part of Oakland's population which'
comes under the head of "commuters'* m
and those who desire stop-over privileges '
will J be- specially interested in a decision' '
handed down by Judge Sanderson yester
day.in the case of the ; Southern Pacific^ '
Company against Dr. W. H. Robiuso'a/
and others, who have for years been bat"- ;
tling for stop-over privileges ,on the rail
road lines oi the defendant company- in
Alameda County. Judge Sanderson saya : .
that the stop-over privilege maybe exer
cised 'if it .is exercised in good faith, but -t
that ' when it is intended .to be â¢ made n I
cause of litigation- it is not a good cause I
for damages. * In 1 reciting the circum- )
stances Judge Sanderson remarks: *;
This action arises upon a.bill in equity seer-,
ing to restrain: certain defendants,' eight in .

cipally in the Justice's Court of AUmeda

These ,3ooo causes of action arose under sec- "

-every railroad corporatism in this State mjnst
upon tender of fare furnish 'each passenger.,
with a ticket for transportation from - the /.
station where purchased to any other station

that such ticket entitles the passenger to ride ' .

. Judge Sanderson notes the fact that "the- â ;
validity of section 490 has been upheld by..'
the Supreme.Cour^ in the case of Kjbin-
Bon'vs. the Southern" Pacific Company,'.butr # '
he points out what he believes- to be two /
very important ; particulars in \-7nich ,the #
Robinson case differs from the case at bar; â¢
namely, the bona fide or good faith of the
'â passengers, and tho matter of damages. â 
! la the Robinson case, Dr. Robinson, wb.iie .
on a trip !rom San Francisco to, A!ameda,- â '
stopped off in Oakland in good faith 'and- â¢
on a matter V of business ; for an 'hour. â¢
Then, attempting to resume" his journey #
to Alameda : ; without . the paymen* of m
further fare, wai refused this privilege, 'Â
! whereby he was damaged in the sum "of
i $499. â -, â â â  'â _ -:'::- *â ;;';. â¢
? ; According to Judge Sanderson's opinion-, .â¢â¢
i the action of ' tne ; Supreme J Court*' in, s
affirming 'Â« the judgment in favor of Dr. â¢
Robinson . "decided that : stop-over privi- ;,
leges must be allowed on those tickets, by
virtue of section ,490, > Civil Code, and it â¢
I decided nothing moreâ the matter of the *."*
I statutory damage, or recovery, being in no V
i way considered by the court." : : r.v *â¢â¢ ""â¢
. The position of the railroad company in *â 
j ; this proceeding is then stated Dy the de- .
: cision to the effect that the plaintiff , who â 
filed these suits had conspired to make '
money out of the company by demanding '',
stop-over privileges solely with the : ex- â¢ .
pectation and for^the purpose of obtaining
refusals, so that they would have ach,ance"
to sue for $200, as allowed by section 490 of â¢
the Civil Code, i Testimony, to sustain* this
position of. the railroad was given at the <
trial, to which Judge Sanderson -refers in
these words i. .' , .
i It may also be stated that it further ap
peared at the trial that the parties being resi
dents of ": Alameda City were accustomed to
resorting to sundry, and divers methods of oc
taining refusals oi these stop-over privileges. â 
It was the procedure of some of them to ride,
from their homes in Alameda. City down to
Oakland pier and then purchase tickets back:
to Alameda, demanding a stop-over at First ana
Broadway. This practice was lepeatedly fol
lowed several times a day. . Anotiu r plan was .
to go by 'streetcars from Alameda to Berkeley,
then buy a ticket back to Alameda via Oakland
pier, demanding a stop-over at ; First and -
Broadway. â¢ â¢ * Some of the defendants,
without being able to give the slightest reason i
therefor, > made â a* - many as i live trips a . day â 
from Berkeley -to Al&meda. This would gtvo
the claimant $1000 ' for such a day* business
if the statute applied in such cases. â 
' Several other plans for demanding stop
over privileges, such as taking the Niles
train, which it was well-known did not go
to Alameda, and going -to Ocean View, in
San Francisco County, to get tickets, were
j resorted to and are commented on by â¢
: Judge Sanderson. When asked why they
stoi ped over in Oakland they frankly ad-,
mitted that they could not tell just why,
but said they thought they must have *
stopped "on business. '.*<;â '." Judge Sanderson â 
said it would be s no" injustice to declare
that the: only X "business" was to prepare'
the way for suing the company for $200 in
each case. He scoffed at the pretension
that the claimants in thus acting were ex- '
ercising their constitutional rights tc buy*
â  tickets, stop over and collect $200 if re
fused the stop-over privilege.
1 â¢'A: number of decisions are quoted at
length by Judge Sanderson in support of
his decision, which goes to the merits of "
the . claims; of "the stop-over passengers.
AH of the claims were formerly merged
by Judge Sanderson's orJer and came un
der his jurisdiction in the present case.
He ; ; declares Â£ that these defendants or
claimants "were engaged in an nn just and
iniquitous effort to make money out of
the comprny by unlawful means," and
concludes by saying: "This court nor any ,
other, I am reasonably confident, will not.
permit them to make money out (r( r of any
individual or corporation by such means.
The judgment must be for the plaintiff."
The amount involved is $6)0,000, which
the railroad company thus gets out of
paying. Â. â ..-.â  \i .' â â  â -:â

The Mauna Loa, the new steamer for

REGION OF THE
KLAMATH INDIANS
Return of the Commission
Appointed by Presi
dent Cleveland.
Boundaries of the Reservation
Surveyed, and .Testimony^
â â¢..'â¢â ' Taken. â  â¢
Commissioners Authorized to Hod Ses
sions in This City to Complete â¢
Their Renort.
The Commissioners appointed by Presi
dent Cleveland to determine the exact
â boundaries of the Klamath Indian Reser
vation in Southeastern Orecon returned
â¢yesterday from that region. Tne commis
sion is composea of W. P. Coleman of St.
Louis (chairman), R. P. Hammond of San
Francisco and J. D. Applegate of Klamath
Falls. Harry J. Brady is secretary.
The Commissioners left this City early
in October and proceeded at once to the
reservation. In 1861 the Indians, some
friendly, and others, hostile, claimed a vast
tract of country in that region. To bring
about a settlement of disputes tbe leading
chiefs and the Government of the United
States entered into a solemn treaty guar
anteeine to the tribes undisputed posses
sion of certain lands. The. boundaries,
however, were somewhat vaguely denned,
as the lines of departure in the"reckoning
â¢were marked by certain mduutains of the
Cascade range. In course of time white
settlers occupied some of the fertile val
leys, and the Indians fancied that the en
croachment was an* invasion of their do
main in violation of the treaty.
In order to ascertain definitely w.hat
valleys belonged to the reservation Sena
tor Mitchell of Oregon procured the pas
saee ot an act or resolution of Congress
authorizing the President to appoint three
Commissioners. It seems that the Gov
ernment has patented to settlers some of
the land claimed by the Indians. Should
the surveys of the commission establish
this claim as a fact the United States will
no doubt indemnify the Indians.
The Commissioners were delayed some*
what in their departure and did not reacn
the reservation until the winter season
had set in. Tbe altitude of the country in
the Cascade range varies from 4000 to
10,000 feet. In many places the Commis
sioners encountered snow to the depth of
three or four feet. The weather was ex
tremely cold. One day the thermometer
registered 15deg. below zero.
The commission was equipped with a
complete camping outfit, an ambulance,
supply wagons, horses, tents, drivers and
cooks. The inclemency of .the weather
did not prevent the commission from
gping forward with the taÃk.
All the exterior lines cf the reservation
were traversed, a work which involved a
journey of 300 miles over forest, mountain
and valley lands.
Winter set in early this year, and the
fall of snow and rain up to date has been
exceptionally large. "The Commissioners
lived in the open air all the time, pitching
their tents and building great firea at
night. An Indian guide kept the camp
well supplied with venison. Elk and bear
were not seen, but the streams yielded
some fish.
The Commissioners took the testimony
of many witnesses on the reservation, and
also held a session at Klamath Falls at
which much testimony was secured.
Ample notes were taken by the Commis
sioners individually and these notes will
be used in preparing the report.
The Interior Department has granted
the Commissioners the privilege of hold
ing sessions in San Francisco to examine
field notes, review tne testimony and pre
pare a report. This work may be accom
plished by December 20. Mr. Coleman,
the chairman, expects to leave for St.
Louis about that time. The Commission
ers are in tbe best of health.
Messrs. Coleman, Hammond and Apple
gate say that they have reached no con
clusions as to tbe claims of the Indians
and settlers. The report, when agreed
upon and signed, will be forwarded to the
Secretary of the Interior and its recom
mendations will not be made public until
the Secretary directs.
On the arrival of the Oregon train yes
terday forenoon W. P. Coleman, the chair
man, went to the home of his brother,
Barry Coleman. General Hammond and
Captain Applegate immediately sought
the services of a barber.

A SUSPECTED FOOTPAD.
George Taylor, Froja St. Louis, Arrested
Early Yesterday Morning.Carrying
a Revolver and an Iron Bar.
â¢A man is locked up in' the "tanks" at
the City Prison, and the police think that
he would have made a reputation as a
footpad if he had not been arrested.
About 2 o'clock ' yesterday morning.
Policeman George Douglass was patrolling
his beat on Post street, and near Jones
street his attention was attracted by tbe
suspicious actions of a man. He watched
him, and as soon ai the man realized that
fact he covered his face with his hat and
started to walk hurriedly away. Douglass
ordered him to stop, and seeing some
thing sticking out of his overcoat pocket
.he drew it out. It was a piece of an iron
bar, sixteen inches long and about one
a harf inches ip diameter. A piece <)f
colored cotton was wrappen around it a.hd
tied with a string. It is an ugly looking
weapon, heavy enough to kill a man with,
one' blow. A revolver loaded in every
chamber was also iound in his pockets,
and $2 in coin.
His answers to Douglass questions not
being satisfactory, he was taken to the
City Prison and placed, in the "tanks '
pending an investigation.
He gave the name of George Taylor. 30
years of age. He is about 5 feet 7 inches
"tall, dark hair and niuatache and was well
dressed.
petectiv.e Bainbridge had a talk with
him yesterday. He told Bainbridge that
he came from 8t Louis -about two weeks
ago. He was a laborer and had been try
ing to tind work, without success.
HÂ« said he had put tbe iron bar and
revolver in nis pocket because he wanted
to be arrested, on account of being unable
to "procure work as a laborer.
Bainbridge asked him if he knew sev
eral well-Known people in St. Louis, but
he bad to admit that they were strangers
to him. -
His statement that he is a laborer is not
believed. His hands are soft and his gen
eral appearance indicates that he has
never done any hard work. If nothing is
discovered about his past record within
the next few days, he will be charged with
carrying concealed weapons and get six
months in the County Jail.
THE AIRSHIP
Which mysteriously floated over this Cfty
and vicinity for some time was seen rising
at 7:30 o'clock last evening by a multitude
of at least 10,000 people, corner Twelfth
and Market streets. It was a sight never
to be forgotten.
On the side of the ship in bold letters
were the words "Smoke Mild Half Million
Club Cigars." The navigator turned its
prow toward the Union Iron Works,
whence it returned at 9 p. m.
Messis. Adelsdorfer & Brandenstein
were offered a sum for it quite in excess of
their expectations by trie representative
of the Cuban revolutionists. Cubans can
appreciate a good article, and the Half
Million Club is thÂ» mildest and best ti^ar
in this market. To-night the airship will
make another ascent from Twelfth and
Market streets at 8 o'clock. It is worth
seeing. _
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
A United States Jury Kestores to Peter
Butts His Brewery.
Several mouths ago Internal Kevenue
Collector 0. M. Wei burn seized Peter
Butts' New York Brewery at Haywards,
Alamecia County, for using canceled
revenue stamps on new packages or kegs
of beer. The evidence of the offense
against the Government was worked up
by B. M. Thomas special apent of the
treasury. After the seizure United States
District Attorney Foote filed an informa
tion in the District Court, in which he
sought to have the brewery and fixtures
forfeited to the Government.
The case of the forfeiture has been on
hearing before District Judge Morrow and
jury for the past two days and much evi
dence was produced by the representatives
of the Government to show that the of
fense complained of was actually commit
ted. Mr. Butts and several witnesses
strenuously denied that old or canceled
stamps had ever been used on new pack
ages of beer. The jury's verdict was
against the Government and to restore
the brewery to Butts.
A Delinquent Debtor in Tronble.
George L. Carroll will be called on by Judge
Seawell to-day to show cause why he should

HAT GOODWIN ON
NUNC PRO TUNC
Filmy Point Which Holds
His Divorce Case in
Court
Although Legally Dismissed, the
Form of the Record Is
to- Be Discussed.
Expta nation of tbe Comedian's Abac
. - . donment of His Application
for Divorce. '
. The Nat Goodwin divorce suit in Judge
Murphy's court yesterday took on all the
elements of comedy, as was entirely appro
priate, the circumstances being con
sidered. Though dismissed and done for,
it still hangs in the air on *a technical
point so fine that only a lawyer's eye can
see it. .
'As soon ' as the case of Nathaniel C.Â»
Goodwin- against- Nella Goodwin was
called Henry C. McPiKe arose and ' an
nounced .that he wished to admit that he
no longer had any grounds to oppose the
position of Attorneys W. 8. Barnes and
R. Porter Ashe, who represented Mr-
Goodwin, and who had from the first
contended that the case of Goodwin vs.
Goodwin .was -dismissed on. the 19th of
â¢last month.. Mr. McPike said that in view
of a decision handed down by the Supreme
: .Oourt of this State on Monday in tbe case
af Kaufmanagainst tlie Superior Court It
was held thatan.entryof judgment relates
back to the! time of the thing of the same
by the- County. Clerk, where it is proved
that there was no neglect on .the part of
the- person seeking to enforce or .insist
upon the judgmerit.'.
I Juuge Murphy smiled blandly and re
marked tl:a't -the Sjipreme. Court had af
firmed the position he had himself favored
at the time of Mr. McP-ike's argument the
day before. â¢ He feft 4hat even without
this last. decision the law would -have
su3tained'Mr..Qoodwin in his contention
that the case was legal fa dismissed. .
It- was ordered .tha}; tlie citation to sho>r
cause why Mr. Goodwin should not pay
$1000 attorneys' fee and $500 a mqnth ali
mony-.and the contempt proceedings
thereunder were also dismissed.
Then came the pinch in the legal con
test. It would naturally be supposed by
an ordinary citizen that the case being

HEBBARD'S REMARKABLE COURSE
IN MODIFYING AN INJUNCTION
D. M. Delmas Presents a Plain Statement Regarding
an Incident Pertinent to the Wiyianis
Libel Case. : . . .
Truth of the Averments Made
in the Circular Offered
in Evidence. .*. ,' â¢:
GENERAL SHEEHAS'S SALARY
Allowed Five Huncred "Dolliirs- a
Month by the Bank Directors' for
His S?rvices. '.' '.. ,-â¢
The greater part of yesterday iq the-
Williams libel case in Judge Dainger
fieid's court was taken up in attempting,
to introduce evidence to show' that, the
statements in the alleged libelous circular
were true, especially those alfusioas. to
General Sheehan as an "Irresponsible po-
lltjcal parasite" and to- Jame% Alva Watt'
as "the notorious James Alva Watt.".-. ."
The defendant, Williams, was-.' never
mentioned at all, and the casual visitor
hearing the testimony would be forced to
the conclusion that Sheehan, Watt .and
Hebbard were the defendants in the case.
The courtroom was crowded with de.
positors in the ill-fated bank, and their
faces fell when they learned that, the gen-,
eral had been drawing $500 per month- ior'
his services, not to speak of another' l"at.
salary to Mr. Watt. â¢â¢
The defense thus far have proved by.
preponderance of evidence that J-u'dge
Hebbard promised to allow the directors
to meet and resign and afterward repudi
ated and denied his promise. â  â¢
Mr. Foote was ktfpt busy the me'st-of the
day in objecting to questrons a3 to the
reputation of James Alva Watt. - "â¢â¢ â¢ .
On the opening of court Samuel M.
Shortridge took the stand for the purpose
of making a correction of a portion of. his
testimony of the day before. His state
ment was as follows: ... "
"Mr. Foote asked me yesterday if I had
ever acted as attorney for Mr. McDenald,"
aud I answered that I -never Jiad. At the
time my mina wasdirefcted to the subject
matter of this inquiry. I recalled lasteveil
ing that many years ago I was associated
with Colonel Flournoy, since -deceased,
and Messrs. Sawyer and Burnett as attor
ney for Mr. McDonald ia si certain divorce
case, some ten or more years ago. I don't J
think I appeared as the attorney of "record
in the matter. That was probably- before
tne organization of the People's Home
Savings Bank."
D. M. Delmas was called to the stand,
and Mr. Foote protested mildly against
allowing him to testify, because a stipula
tion bad been made yesterday thet Mr.
Delmas would testify to the same effectas
did Mr. Shortridge regarding the pledge
or promise made by Judge Hebbard in his
chambers that he would modify the in
junction, and Judge Hebbard*'s subse
quent repudiation aud denial of that
promise. t â¢
Counsel for the defense explained that
on the day before they we're not aware
that Mr. D;lmas would be able to attend.
The court allowed Mr. Delmas "to testify.
The witness told about the meeting in
Judge Hebbard's chambers. There were"
present on that occasion Judge Heboard,
Samuel M. Shortridge. Mr. McCarthy and
Mr. Hutton.
"Tbe substance of the conference was
this," continued Mr. Delmas. "In order
to make it intelligible I shall have to state
that an injunction had been issued* by the
Superior Court enjoining the board of di
rectors from meeting and transacting any
corporate business of any kind whatever.
The object of the interview in Judge Heb-'
bard 'a chambers, as I understood it, was
to see how far that injunction could be
relaxed so as to permit the bpard to meet
for the purpose of resigning and electing
tbeir successors. After that meeting Judge
Hebbard said that he would so far relax
or modify nis order of injunction as to
permit the board to meet and resign and
elect iheir successors, provided that they
elected a board selected by aud agreed to
by the committee of depositors of the
bank, that committee being represented,
as I understood it, at that time by Mr.
. McCarthy and whoever else was present
with him at the lime.
"I don't remember that any names were
mentioned 011 that occasion. Judge Heb
bard added the following to his remarks:
'I will permit the board 10 meet in my
courtroom,' which was adjoining his
chambers."
The witness next told about appearing
in court on a subsequent occasion for the
purpose of having Judge Hebbard sign an
order for a modification of the injunction.
Mr. Delmas said:
"I iniorraed the court that in pursuance
of its own suggestions the committee of
depositors had selected a board which tney
desired to act, and requested the court to
issue, an order enabling them to carry out
that purpose. There seemed to De some
disinclination on the part of the Judge to
do so, and I reminded the Judge of the
statement made by him in Ins chambers,
that there would be a modification of the
injunction for that purpose. The Judge
denied that he had ever made such a state
ment. I then said that the statement
could be proved by a number of persons
who were at that very time in the court
room.
"Judge Hebbard insisted in maintaining
bis position, that the court had made no
such promise and had entered into no
fuch bargain or anything of that kind, as
he termed it. My recollection is that writ
ten resignations had been signed by the
old board and placed in the hnnds of the
committee ready to be used. On that oc
casion H. E. Hrghton represented Graves,
"Jenkins and â¢â  Montgomery. J. -H, Durst
represented Dr.'Boildhe at sojne stage of
the .proceedings." ...
â¢ Walter J. Bartnett, aft'orney-at-law, was
the nexj.' witness. He said' : that ho ap
peared in Judge Het)bard!s cj&urt on one
â¢occasion representing 2600 d-.epositors oi
the bank. and $725,000 of de'oos.its.
' "Do 'you know anything about an ac
counting or pretendeS aceoiruiing by Gen
eral-John F. She.ehanjot.tbe affairs of the
bank?" ..'â¢â¢ â¢" . 'â¢ â¢â 
MX Foote's prompt dbjeetion to this
question was- sustained. The \Vitne3s went
.on to .say- that ih. January, 18^-the.matter
of the accounting jcame up' before ludge
Hebbar.d. " James. Aiva W'a-tt was present,
representing' General Sheehan-, and T.-
Carl Spelling was present also. Mr. Watt
asked that General eSheeban be diacuarged
as r-eceiver'of ihe bank. Mr. Spelling op
posed the discharge on me ground that
there had been no proper accounting filed
'in .the court and 'that there, had been no
statement of the receipts .and.disburse
me^its of the bank; that the.compensation
of the receiver had nat been fixed. â¢ Judjie
Hebbard. stated .that he understood that
he had nothing to do with fixing the com
.pensation of the re.ceiveroT. Qf his attor
ney; that theStfpremer.Courtha'd virtually
decided that the receivership was invalid i

the tees.of the seceiy'er.
Objection having been made, to thjs line
of- evidence. Mr. Henley, wittj a copy of
the alleged libelous circular in his hand,
proceeded to argue the matter. ...
"The object of the testimony.'^said^Mr.
Henley, "is to sustain the allegation of
this circular in respect to the improper
discharge of the receivers"
The witness went on to say that in
December, 1b94, an expert was- placpd on
the- books oi the. bank by tbÂ« California
Safe Deposit and Trust Company and tue
expert reported to witness, every day. In
the latter part 01 December General John
iT. Sbeehan refused' to permit the expert
to examine the books ajiy further.. The
general was compelled some time iu]Janu
ary, 1895, under an alternative .writ of
mandamus served upon him; to again
allow the expert to inspect the books.
The retirement of three of the directors
left the old board in the majority, .
Mr. Bartnett next related the substance
of what occurred at a meeting in tbe
office of the California Safe Deuosit and
Trust Company, on wbich occasion 'Judge
Hebbard suggested that the depositors
ougiit to have a majority of 'tbe board of
dire'etors. General Hheehan objected to
the depositors having a majority and it
was finally agreed that they were to have
three directors out of tbe board of seven.
T. H. McCarthy, the next witness, was
asked by Mr. Henley whether he knew
James Alva Watt by reputation or other
wise before Watt had secured his appoint
ment and the witness replied that he did
not.
"Did you know it afterward?" was the
next question.
Mr. Foote objected and made a speech
in which he explained that he objected to
Mr. Watt's reputation being attacked
merely because some disgruntled stock
holders were not satisfied with his action.
Mr. Henley thereupon proceeded to
read the alleged libelous circular, and
commented upon its opening statements
as being true and substantiated by the
evidence taken in the case thus far. Mr.
Henley read from the circular as follows:
In May, 1894, depositors in ihe insolvent
People's Home Savings Bank organized and
appointed a committee to look after their in
lerests. Their first efforts were directed
toward securing a satisfactory board of direc
tors. The existing board had been prohibited
from meeting for any purpose whatever by
Judge Hebbard.
"That's true." commented Mr. Henley.
He then read the mention of "the notori
ous James Alva Watt," and the mention
of the nnme of General Sheehan as "an
irresponsible, political parasite."
"Now, the proposition is simply this,"
said Mr. Henley, "that by reason of the
fact that this character of persons was ap
pointed by Judge Hebbard, it is not al
leged, as your Honor will see, that Judge
Hebbani appointed these men knowing
them to be so and so; but the proposition
was that a Judge who would violate his
promiseâ who would appoint men of this
character to positions of this sortâ was an
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1896.
u-niair and an unfit man to be Judge, and
the voters ot the City and County of San
Francisco were notified by the circular to
that effect. We submit that whatever
was done by Watt in the way of manipu
lating the affairs of tbe bank so as to pre
serve the ascendency of himself and'Shee
han is admissible in this case, because
that is what Hebbard is charged with.
"Was not Judee Hebbard responsible
for the scandalous mismanagement of the
affairs of the bank since its misfortunes?
The efforts of these depositors to secure a
satisfactory board of directors in order
that the depositors, the men, women and
children whose money had been put into
this bank, should be in tbe hands of their
representatives and not in the hands of
men who bad no interest in tbe-bank
whatever, were obstructed by Judge-Heb
bard. ,
"If this allegation, of the notoriety of
James Alva Watt, if it is a libel on a Judge
to allege that he has appointed a notorious
character, we may bring proof of that
fact."
"The circular states," said Judge Dain
feerh'eld. "that Judge Hebbard's bosom
friend was a notorious character." .
District Attorney Barnes objected to the
testimony on this point on the ground
tbat the witness did not know the reputa
tionof James Alva Watt when he was ap
pointed. The object "of it was to allow the
counsel for the defenne to present them
selves before tbe jury with a club in their
hands to beat the brains out of persons
not connected with the case. He thought
it was eminently improper.
The court remarked that no attempt
had been made up to the, present time to
show tnat the prosecuting witness knew
of the notoriety of the person appointed
by him, but nevertheless, independently
of his personal knowledge of the notoriety
of Mr. ,Watt, the statement would be
damaging, and therefore the defense
would huve a right to prove'-the trutb of
the language claimed to be defamatory.
'â¢I see ho escape from it, because to rule
it out would be to' deprive the defendant
of the right he has to prove the defama
tory language of the circular;" â  added
Judee Dainiierfield..
"When did you first acquire a knowJ
edge of the" reputation- of James Aiva
Watt?" asked Mr. Henley.
"In an interview I bad with .him'after
the conference in the Judge's chambers,"
replied the witness. "Inaddition to that
I acquired other knowledge as to Mr.
W atrs character."
. "From what you learned did you arrive
at any opinion that Mr. Watt was a no- â¢
torious character?" was' asked. . . â¢
Mr. Foote objected.
"How could I prove," asked Mr. Henley
of -the court, "that Claude Duval was a
notorious person without ing uring . from
somebody? I don't, wish, of course,, to
institute any disparaging comparison be
tween Claude Duval and Mr. Watt,"
added .Mr. Henley, bowing politely in the
direction of Mr. Watt, who was sitting ber
side his friend, Judge Hebbard. ."There
are notorious persons in this City who
have never been convicted of any crime."
The court thought that the question
called for the opinion of the witness, and
was not therefore admissible. :
Mr. Henley argued that JamÂ»s Alva
Watt def-ated tbe proposed reorganiza
tion "because he-was afraid that he would
lose hia job. Here is an institution," con
tinued Mr. Henley, "in which tens of
thousands of men, women and children
in this City are interested, and which has
fallen into the hands of men who are noÂ°t
satisfactory to tbe depositors. Judge
Hebbard promised that he would allow
them to reorganize the board of directors,
and the next day the Judge denied his
promise. In view of these facts can we
not show Jamea Alva Watt's intimacy
with Judge Hebbard, aud the fact that
Watt interviewed parties who were
named for the new board as to their
opinions on certain mntters connected
with the management of the bank, and
cannot we argue to the jury why it was
that Judge Hebbard repudiated and de
nied that promise? Why was. it unlssa
something occult and sinister existed?
"It was Watt whose fat job was in
danger by tbe displacement of the old
board and the installment of tbe new. We
want to show, as illustrating the intimacy
between those mÂ«n that Mr. >Vatt went to
Sacramento and made a nominating
speech in behalf of Judge Hebb,ird."
Mr. Foote -objected. He saia that he
didn't want to have pol. tics mixed up ki
the matter.
Mr. Henleyâ l intend to proye in this
case that Judge Hebbard â
"I object," shouted Mr Foote.
"The record shows the making of the
promise by Judge Hebbard," continued
Mr. Henley, "and his subsequent repudia
tion of that promise. It shows also the
meeting of S. M. Shortridge, James Alva
Watt and Judge Hebhard in the rooms of
the Union League Club, and the fact that
Mr. Shortridge showed the names of the
proposed new directors to Mr. Watt The
intimacy of these two, Jud^e Hebbard and
James Alva Watt, is perlirient totlie isaue.
We are ready to prove that this proposed
reorganization was not satisfactory to Mr.
Wait."
The court sustained Mr. Foote's objec
tion and took a recess until 2 p. M.
After recess E. J. L vernash, attorney
at-law, testified as to Mr. Delmas remind
ing Judire Hebbard of his promise and
Judee Hebbard's denial of the same. He
was asked concerning a conversation had
by him with General Sheehan, with refer
ence to some stocic of the bank owned by
Livernasli and Mr. Foote's usual objec
tion to something interesting was put for
ward.
Mr. Henley said that he proposed to
prove that Watt and Sheehan were con
federates and acting together.
The objection was sustained and Mr.
Livernash carried away the secret in his
breast.
T. Carl Spelling, an attorney, was put
on the statii and when the tir:Â»t question
was asked him by Mr. Henley in which
Judge Hebbaid was referred to as "the
prosscuto:," Mr. Foots raised another ob
jection and demanded that the Jud*e
should be mentioned as the prosecuting
witness. Mr. Thornton of counsel for the
defense read a section of the Penal Code
to show that the words "complainant,"
"informer," and "prosecutor" were used
synonomously.
Mr. Spelling narrated what had bap
peued in Judge Hebbard's chambers one
evening when tbe Judge wrote an order in
the Goldtree case and gave it to Watt. He
related also what he had heard that day
in court when Mr. Delmas called Judge
Hebbard's attention to bis promise and
about Judge Hebard's denial of the same.
Then Mr. Spelling was asked as to the
reasons why he had drawn >$500 from the
bank, and Mr. Spelling, who appeared to
be very uneasy at the question, replied
that he had been allowed the money by
the directors for his services as attorney
in a case outside of and not connected
at all with this one. He appeared to im
pute a sinister motive in Mr. Thornton's
asking the question. This caused Mr.
Thornton to remark that Mr. Spelling was
mistaken as to the outcome of tbe case
and that the court records showed that
the case had been dismissed.
T. H. McCarthy was recalled and was
asked whether the reputation or the ac
tions of James Alva f^att had not formed
the subject of a discussion among the
people. Mr. McCarthy replied that he
had beard Mr. Watt discussed in a very
uncomplimentary way in tbe Foresters'
and the B'nai B'rith halls.
"Did you si^n this circular?" asked Mr.
Foote on the cross-examination.
Mr. McCarthy declined to answer any
questions of that purport on the statutory
grounds.
General John F. Sheehan was tbe next
witness. In response to questions by Mr.
Henley be said that he acquired his title
of general because he had been adjutant
general on the staff of Governor Perkins.
He also held the position of Register of
the United States Land Office in this City,
.and was holding that position on the day
he was appointed receiver of the People's
Home Savings Bank. He was also secre
tary of the Yosemite Commission at a
salary of $75 per mouth. He was ap
pointed by Judge Hebbard as one of the
Commissioners in the case of Emeric vs.
Alvarado, a three years* job. He was al
lowed $11,000 for his services in that case.
He was also a receiver in three cases in
which the People's Home Savings Bank
was concerned.
He drew nothing from the bank daring
the first month of his employment as re
ceiver, .and after that he drew $250 per
month to live on. Then the directors
made him an allowance of $500 per month
for tbe whole time, which amount he
drew. He was not positive whether as re
ceiver he had made an accounting to the
'court or not. He had signed a statement
to the court of receipts and expenditures.
Mr. Watt was his attorney in tne prep
aration of his account, and Mr. Watt was
also attorney for the bank.
â¢ "It wa3 the duty of Mr. Watt as attorney
for the bank to contest any improper ac
count presented by tbe receiver, was it
not?"
Mr. Foote objected again, and the court
adjourned until 10 o'clock this morning.

MRS, KELLER AND
HER TEN TRUNKS
She Will Have to Ransack
Them All for Her Old
Love Letters. ."
Says They Are in a Cold Cellar
and, Besides, Have Been
Badly Rifled.
Now Declares the Cartload of "My
Dear Wife" Epistles Were Car
ried Away Long Ago.
Marie Viola Keller, who claims to be
the widow of the late Judge Hastings,
spent an interesting hour before Notary
Levy yesterday afternoon in the office of
Samuel M. Shortridge.
Tbe lady's deposition was being taken
in the matter of ber contest of Judge
Hastings' will.
Mr. Sbortridge had called upon Mrs.
Keller to produce a number of letters
which she claimed the Judge had written
to her and wherein she said she was ad
dressed by him as "My Dear Wife," "My
Darling Wife," "My Pet" and other such
terms of endearment. Mrs. Keller had
said such letters were or had been in her
possession, but flatly refused to produce
them unless compelled by the court to do
so. Mr. Shortridge a few days ago se
cured from Judge Coffey an order com
manding the lady to produce the letters,
and it was to receive them at her hands
and to hear her statements concerning
them that she was cited to appear before
the notary in the attorney's office yester
day afternoon.
But she did not bring the letters. More
than that, she declared it to be more tban
likely that in all the vast recesses of her
ten trunks and two boxes, where she had
formerly stored the endearing epistles,
not one of them could now be found.
Neither could she name a place that they
might be found, except it be among Rob
ert Hastings' papers. Robert, she said,
had rifled her trunks time and time again
and she was certain bad carried away
everything in the form of writing which
could be of value to her in this proceed
ing.
"They would not have dared to bring
suit against me and to defy me unless
they thought they had all my letters and
papers that might go to prove my rights
as a wife," she said.
"My trunks were rifled" â Mrs. Keller
used this word frequently, but insisted
upon pronouncing it "raffled" â "at San
Rafael and at every boarding-bouse that I
have been in for several years. Kobert
did it; he was responsible for it; be did it
all."
Mr. Shortridge went over the testimony
of the lady as given previously, reading
her answers to questions concerning these
letters, in which she distinctly stated that
she had a great number of these letters
addressed to ber in the terms peculiar
from husband to wife. In every instance
Mrs. Keller declared that she had been
misreported and wanted the record modi
fied. Where, for instance, she was re
ported as having said that she "had the
letters," she insisted that the record be
made to read that she "bad had the let
ters."
Introductory to the taking of tbe de
position, Mr. Shortridge recited the pro"
ceedings leading up to it, tbe refusal of
tbe witness to produce the letters except
upon an order of tbe court and this by ad
vice of ber counsel. He read Judge Cof
fey's order, and then made a formal de
mand for the production of the letters
under its authority. .
Mrs. Keller said she had! not bad time
to make an examination of ber trunks and
boxes, of which she has tweive, . and
wherein thn letters were formerly kept.
She said that many of tbe trunks were
locked and the keys lost.
"It would be easy to find a locksmith
who could furnish a key,' would it not?"
asked Mr. Shortridge.
The lady admitted that it would be
easy. Tbe attorney wanted to know what
tbe witness kept in such a number of
trunks and boxes.
< "Such things as a lady may be expected
to have," was the answer. "They are
chiefly tilled with wearing apparel and
manuscript."
"What, for instance, is the manu
script?"
"I have written a number of poems,
enougli to make a volume," said the wit
ness. "I have sent a number of them to
tbe Examiner."
She was asked bow long it would take
her to go through the trunks and find tne
letters, if any were there to be found.
Sbe thought she could do this in about
two months. She said the trunks were in
a cold cellar, that she was sick and that
she could not think of going into them at
present. She had been throu h but two
of the trunks within tbe last six or eight
months, and those only to tee whether or
not they had been robbed. She declared
that she had never given to her attorney,
Mr. Sullivan, any letters addressed to her
in tbe endearing terms referred to, nor
bad she in her immediate possession any
such letters.
Mr. Sullivan statedjalso that he had no
such letter, nor had be ever received
any.
Mr. Shortridge then asked the notary to
request of the witness that she produce
the letters to-morrow if she bad any, say
ing that the time she required was ridicu
lous, and that he was sure tbe court
would think so too.
Mrs. Keller said she was ill and could
not possibly go through ber trunks before
to-morrow.
Mr. Shortridge said be did not wish to
ask anything that would tax the lady's
health or strength. He extended tbe time
to Saturday.
Mr. Sullivan said he would advise his
client to produce tbe letters if she could.
The hearing then went over until Sat
urday.
CARRIED HIS LAST PAPER.
A Clever Dog Who Assisted His Mas
ter In Delivering Evening Fapen
in This City.
Edward Gleizee, a carrier of the Evening
Post, mourns tbe loss of a largo black dog
that for many years had been bis constant
companion and assistant in bis tour of
delivery. Tbe animal sickened a few days
since, and yesterday passed to that un
known where all good dogs go.
Tbe faithful canine served his master
well and saved him many steps in going
over nis route. The dog had learned how
his master would leave papers at certain
places, and while the man was delivering
on one side of tbe street bis four-footed
companion would receive a rolled paper
and deliver it on the other side, where it
belonged. One of the customers the ani
mal served was a bakery on Kearny street,
and when he first came there with a paper
be was given a cake. He never iorgot
that, for every evening afterf ter leaving the
paper he would remain on the premises
until given a cake, after which he would
hasten to rejoin his master and receive an
other paper to deliver.
COL. FOLLIS CRITICALLY ILL.
Because of Appendicitis Physicians Per-
formed a Surgical Operation.
Lieutenant-Colonel Fred Follis of the
California National Gnard is in a danger
ous condition at his home, 2230 Washing
ton street. For some *time past he baa

his home, it was stated that be had
slightly improved during the afternoon,
but that he was not regarded by aDy means
as being out of danger.

Some of the wise visitin? Eastern horse
men wbo know about all there is to learn
resort to some very wise tactics to fool th<*
wild and woolly Westerner.
The second event on the card-yesterday
was a six-furlong dash for two-year-olds,
and a great air of mystery was prevalent
in the rine prior to its decision. Among
the starters was Ed Purser's fast filly
Scarf Pin, which made her initial appear
ance here. Another starter was Dunboy,
entered in the name of W. W. Murry, who
trains a number of horses lor Purser;
although since her arrival Scarf Pin has
been in the charge of Tommy Lottridge.
In the opening betting Stentor opened at
7to 5 and Purser's filly at Bto 5. After
progressing some minutes Presiding
Judge Rees had the betting stopped and
ordered Bcarf Pin and Dunboy coupled,
as they were apparently running in the
same interests. Then the stable and Sten
tor both opened at 6to 5. Bcarf Pin was
evidently not meant, for with her stable
companion the duo receded in the betting
to 8 to 5, while the educated coin sent
Stentor to the post 11 to 10.

If people possessing good horses seek
to delraud the public until a price that
suks their fancy is obtained they should
be ruled off the turf, for ibeir presence is
a menace to the sport and serves to disgust
the general public with the game. Each
winter there come to California a clique
who run their horses "stiff" or short until
the idea is gained that they are "skates,"
and then the watermelon is sliced.
There were no other sensational fea
tures about the afternoon's racing. The
day and track were perfect, and as four of

PERISHED IN THE WAVES.
Felipi Catalan!, a Crab - Flslrer,
Drowned Near tlie Ocean
Beach.
Felipi Catalan!, an .Italian crab-fisher,'
lost his life in the high surf off Lands.
End, near Point Lobos, yesterday noon.
He and his partner, Nicola Vento, started"
for the open pea in a small crabboat, and,.
after passing Fort Point, they toek the
south channel. Sooth -of Bakers Beach
they found that the waves were running
high, and a stiff wind was blowing from
the northwest, which set them in toward
the shore.
For a time they struggled on, evidently
in the hope of passing-the outer point, but i
their efforts were of no avail, and the little
boat wus tossed about like a cork and
gradually driven toward the cocks and
breakers. At last a huge breaker picked
up the craft, and' after carrying it nearly
seventy-five yards toward the land turned
it completely over. It is believed that
when Catalani was in the water the bout
was burled upon him, injuring his back.
He ceased to swim, and his partner had all
he could do.to save himself.
The accident was witnessed by Chris
Tholo, a member of the life-saving ser
vice crew at the Golden Gate station, who
did all be could to rescue Vento and the
body of the drowned man. At last the
body was recovered, and other members
of the life-saving cew worked nobly for
over an hour to recuscitate tb â¢ man, but
to no purpose.
The Coroner was notified and tooK the
body to the Morgue.
Catalani lived on Vallejo and Battery
streets. He leaves a family.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
% â¢â¢ Financial.
, NEW YORK. N. Dec. 1.-Stocks . early In
the day were weaker on further selling. by profes
sional operators, who have been working to bring
about liquidations for over a week. The decline
was insignificant, except in the case of a few
specialties such as Illinois Steel, Denver and Rio
Grande and Big Four*. The tactics :of the . bears
and sold cut bulls failed to dislodge long stock; and
shortly after the opening the 'market drifted into
dullness. Id the last hour, the bears, recognizing
their Inability to depress prices, started in to cover.
The result was an advance all along the line, in
the case of Jersey Central, Consolidated Gas,
Omaha and Chicago Gas the rise extended from
2Va to 3y a per cent.' * .'â 'â ''â  â¢â --.-â

prominent Issues moved up i/ 2 to 2 per cent.,
ManAauan, Sugar, the Grangers. Tennessee Coal.
Louisville and Nashville, Re din?, ihe :-outh
westerns and Pacific Mail all being in good request-
The change for the better, during the afternoon
session was due main y to an impression that the
President's message vrt 1 be of a pacific character.
The President, it is understood, will no. take a
decided .stand on the -Cuban question, and will
leave the matter for the incoming: administration.
The rise in Omaha common was due to rumors
that the directors intended to declare a dividend
on the stock in the near ure. The story on the
board is that the dividend will be at the rate o< 4
per cent per annum. Speculation closed strung
with an advanced tendency. Net changes show
gains of 'I@3 . per cent. ' Total sales were '^95,304

V . CHICAGO MAKKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. I.â Deliveries of ..wheat
.on December contracts thls'morning were so sm all
that they were not worth considering. Their in*
'sigarn'cance' tended to impart confidence to hold
ers, cut a decline of Id at Liverpool.was of greater
influence as.'a factor and prices opened lower. No
.aggressive activity either by sellers "or buyers was
noted; 'In fact the trade was remarkably light,
Receipts In the Northwest,,3l6 cars against 562
last, 'luesdav and 1343 a year ago, were encourag
' Ing; although snow blockades in that section may
â¢ have a great deal to do with the restricted move
ments. Chicago received 58 cart and inspected
out 24.976 bushels. -
Thoman issued a report to-day estimating the
supplies of wbeat in ; first hands at 66,000,000
â  bushels less than a year ago. He also save the
ar. a now seeded as 25,00J,000 acres, against 23,-
OOu. oo a year ago. and the condition as 97.6 per
cent, against 86.7 per cent at the corresponding
time In 1895. Bradstreet's reported a decrease in
the world's stocks of 366,000 bushels, which.
. lromthe small of the reduction, proved detri
mental to prices. -Closing Paris cables were lower;
Berlin and Antwerp higher. Export clearances
amounted to 30Â£ ; 748 bushels. At the close the
feelici; was weak, and inside quotations wera es
tablished about that time. May wheat opened
from 843/gc to 84y sold between 8-ls/gc and
833/gc, . closing at . Â«3%c, lV4c under yesterday.
tstima.ed receipts for to-morrow, 9 cars. No. 2
red spot wheat rouged from 90V4c to 92& B e, clos
ing at about 90Vic to 91 Via
COi-.Nâ The corn market simply followed that
of wheat. Irading was not such as to attract par
ticular notice, a tew commission rneji and scalpers
only doing a little business. Tuom'an in bis report
gave his final estimate on the corn yield of 1896
at 2,468,000.000 bushels, an average per acre of
29.76 bushels. Receipts were 243 cars andâ¢lÃ6,
-800 bushels were taken from store. Liverpool Ca
dU-b were Vi@V3 d lower. Bradstreet's reported a
decrease lv stocks of. 104,000 bushels. Export
clearances amounted to 101,627 bushels. May
corn opened at -6%<~, sold between 26% c and
26% c. closing at 2bS/8@2t534c, 1/8 to Vie under
yesterday. - Estlniatexl receipts for to-morrow, 200
cars. Â«
OATSâ Declined, the lO3S, however, not being
great. 'The action of the other markets was the
controlling agent. Thoman estimated the yield of
oats for 1896 at 755.000.000 bushels, an average
per acre of v:6.04 bushels. Receipts were 251 cars
and 68 000 bushels were taken fiom store. Brad
street's reported an increase in stocks of 335,
bushels. Export clearances were, 23,975 bushels.
May oats closed i/g lower. Estimated receipts for
10 morrow 100 cars.
i'LAXâ Cash No. 1 Northwestern, 78c

PROVlslo^NSâ The provision market opened
active with everybody anxious to sell. The de
mand was backward and price* receded. An un
expected heavy run of hogs at the yards, attended
by a decline In their pr.ces, was responsible for
the weak nesj in product. Later business showed
less animation. January porn closed 30c, lower;

THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP.
The First Publication Â«.f the' Sketch
â¢ Which Slad-e Bret ilarte Famous. . '
In July, 1868, when" the Overland
Monthly was founded,. Bret Harte became
its editor. Ilpunseville' Wildman, the
editor of the Overland .Monthly, new
series, has re.cently. written: "When-An
ton Roman made up. his mind to establish
a monthly' magazine in connection with
his publishing and book-sellin's business
he did so- with the advice of Noah
Brooks, Charles Warren Stoddard, B. 8..
Redding. W. C. Bartlett and others,
for most of whom he had already puo
lished â¢ books. When the question, of a'
suitable editor arose Stcddard recom
mended Bret harte, then an almost un
known writer on the Golden Era, at that
time a popular weekly. Bret Harte ac
cepted with some misgivings as to finan
cial matters, but was reassured when Ro
man saowed him pledges ot support by
advertising patronage- up to $900 a month,'
which he had secured in advance." In
the August number of that magazine ap
peared "The Luck of Roaring CainD." If
Mr. Harte had been in- doubt as to his vo
cation before, that doubt was now dis
pelled forever. Never was a reqre emphatic
or unquestionable literary success. That
success began in the ' composing-room,
when a femaie compositor revolted at the
unaccustomed combination of mentai
force, virility and originality. No doubt
it was all very sudden and unexpected ; it
shook the editorial and composing rooms,
the business office, and a limited number
of worthy peopie who had seen "The
Luck" in manuscript, as they never had
been shaken save oy the notorious Cali
fornia earthquake. The climax' was pre
cipitated when the justly indignant
editor, whose motives, literary judgment
and good taste had been impeached, de
clared that "The Luck of Roaring C.amp"
should appear-in the very next issue ol
the Overland Monthly or he would resign
his, office. Wisdom finally prevailed ;â  the
article appeared, the Overland's success
was assured and the editor was famous.â

Much comment: is being made among
propefty-owners on the set. that James
de Fremery, a West Oakland landed pro
prietor, has offered to sell to the city for a
public park a large tract Of land lor $10,
-000, which is assessed for $16,000,* and
â¢ o which should be, accord iÃ,g to the usual
calculation, worth a marketable price of
at least $25,000. .

â  some inquiry into the tacts and records,
â  Which bear ouC his theory th&t a tax levy
of $1 for Oakland, is equivalent hi propor
, o tion to a levy of $1 35 in Los Angeles.
Â° "The peculiarity of this.offer of Mr. de
Â° o â ifreniery can or'.iy be explained in one*
way," said the Mayoi. "There is no
doubt' that property in, this city is assessed
.higher than anywhere else in the State.
;â¢ This wpiifd work rio hardship if the levy
were in proportion.' But some, people do
0 nor^ieem able to comprehend the fact that
o a levy of $1 on property assessed for all

;" J | .' oil property that is* only assessed for
half its value. Only on this basis can the

RECONCILED TO FATE.
Berkeley Students Having Nothing to
Say About Football â Ca plain Ban
some Champions Butterworth.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Dec. I.â Apropos of
the recent charges brought against Coach
Butterworth as to his alleged neglect of
duty as Berkeley's football instructor,
Captain Ransome ha.s prepared a state
ment to the public in which he resents the
attack and deplores that the football men
at the university have been placed in sucn
an unsport^manliue position. He says
Butterworth did all in his power to make
the team efficient, and that it was no fault
of the coach that the team failed.
'I and the rest of tbe team," says he,
"feel that we have been put in the posi
tion of 'squealers.' This squealing has
come from men on tbe outsule ami should
be taken for what it is worth. Â£*et me
again say that the team heartily supports
Mr. Butterworth and that we do not hold
him responsible for our defeat. We were
defeated iairly and squarely and have no
excuses to offer."
This statement on the part of Berkeley's
captain is a practical iteration of what ap
peared in a recent issue of The Call with
regard to the feeling of the football men
toward Butterworth, notwithstanding the
various lengthy printed reports to the
contrary.
The sting of defeat is gradually wearing
off, and the students are becoming reporr
ciled to their fate. Yesterday was the first
day of college since the game, arrd a more
quiet and reserved set of students the
walls of the university, never saw. Silence,
>AMUEL McBROWN, a Well-Known Pioneer, Who Left His
Family for Seventeen Years in Central America, and
Only Came Home to Die. '
so far as football was concerned, reigned '
supreme.
Long editorials on the result of ihe game
and the lessons it should teach appeared
both yesterday and to-day in the college
daily â the Berkeleyan.
â¢ A graceftfl tribute is paid to Captain
Ransome and each of the other men who
played in turn.
Want to Be Free.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. I.â Citizens of
Berkeley'are in hopes that the proposed
bill which provides for the redlstricting
of Alameda County so as to bring the en
tire town of Berkeley within one County
Supervisorial, one Senatorial and one As
sembly district will b? passed at the next
Legislature. Tho town is now divided as
to all three of these, and, in consequence,
it is said that it loses the political strength
to which it is entitled. In the matter of
Supervisorial, Senatorial and Assembly
districts, the university town is now
tacked to different portions of Oakland, so
that its influence as a town, in so far as it
may have differences with Oakland, is
lost. '
Another cause for complaint is the con
fusion of boundaries that has resulted in
the extension of the town boundaries and
from the division into wards, tbe dividing
lines of which do not coincide with those
of any of the election districts. Berke
ley's representatives in the coming Legis
lature will work for the correction of all
those present defects in the election dis
trict lines, and in doing so may, it is be
lieved, encounter some opposition from
Oakland, as the proposed changes will de
tract to a certain extent from the political
influence of that city.
Resolutions Passed.

RETURNED HOME
TO MEET DEATH
Close of the Romantic Career
of Pioneer Samuel
McÃrown.
While -Mysteriously Absent He
Acquired an Immense Estate
in Central America.
Was .Successful as a Miner, a Lawyer,
a CoffeoPlanter and a Land
Speculator.
Oakland Office Saw Frakcibco Call,)
908 Broadway, December L f
Many of the pioneers have lived roman
tic lives, but the career of few can compare
in that respect with that of Samuel Mc-
Clarty Brown of this city who hasÂ«just
died.
Nearly a score of years ago Mr. Mc-
Brown was one of the leading business
men of San Francisco and was possessed
of considerable wealth. Without giving
any warning he suddenly left that city
| and was not heard of lor many years.
Not long ago it was found that he was liv
ing in Central America, where he owned
thousands of acres of coffee plantations
and other profitable investments.
Soon after his whereabouts was discov
ered he was attacked with a serious illness,
and was informed by his medical adviser
that be had not long to live. A few
months ago, without any warning, he re
turned to San Francisco as suddenly as
he had left. It was somewhat difficult
for his wife, who still resides in this city,
to realize that he was her long lost hus
band, who for many years had been re
garded as dead. There was a family re
union attended by all the members, in
cluding a brother of Mr. McÃrown, who
is a Supervisor of Sacramento, aud nu
merous grandchildren, of whose existence
the old pioneer coffee-planter was not
aware.
Since his arrival he has been gradually
failing in health, and although a small
fortune was spent by him in search for re
lief, it produced no result and he died
from a complication of cancer and ma
la: ia contracted in South America among
his mines and plantations.
Samuel McÃrown was a native of Meade
County, Ky., where he was born aixty
eight years ago. He was a graduate of
Mt. Morana Colleee and studied law with
the Hon. James Stewart, graduating be
fore he reached the a>;e of 21. In 1849 he
was attracted to California by the stories
of gold discoveries and came here by way
of New Orleans on the steamer Falcon, iv
company with Al Hollenbeck, now of Los
Angeles; Edward McGowan, Colonel Wil
liam Gift, Secretary of State tinder Presi
dent Jackson; Orrin Bailey and Charles
Foster. He at once engaged in mnving in
Tuolumne County, afterward going to the
northern mines at Foster's Bar, Yuba
County, finally locating in Nevada
County.
While living in Nevada County he mar
ried Miss F. L. Hartman, daughter of Dr.
Andrew Hartman, the pioneer fruit
grower of that section. When the silver
excitement broke out in what was then
the Territory of Nevada Mr. McÃrown
opened a law office in tne town of Austin,
with George C. Hupp of Nevada City for
a partner. They succeeded in their pro
fession, and were followed by Judge John
S. Garber, now of Berkeley, who lately re
tired from the farm of Garber, BoaJt <fc
Bishop.
After laying the foundation of a fortune
in the mines Mr. McÃrown moved to
Oakland, and between this city and San
Francisco he lived a few years. He then
went to South America and returned home
to die. The funeral took place this after
noon at the Masonic Cemetery. The pall
bearers were Carlos G. White, P. H. Cow
ard, George Craddock, Horace P. Brown,
W. E. Logan and. Mr. Meese. The de
ceased leaves a large family, consisting of
his widow, Mry. Flora L. Brown, four
daughters, Mrs. Walter E. Logan, Mrs.
Percy Coward, Miss Eloise Brown
and Miss Violet Brown, and an only
son, Horace P. Brown, senior member
of tne linn of Brown, Meese & Craddock,
of Ban Francisco.

C. A. REYNOLDS
SUES HIMSELF
A Custom-House Employe
Who Is Plaintiff and
Defendant.
Case Tbat Is Unparalleled in
the History of Local Ju
risprudence.
The Action Taken to Be Relieved
From Paying an Exorbitant
Rats of Interest.
One of the most extraordinary cases
and one that is perhaps unparalleled in
the history of local jurisprudence came
before Justice of the Peace Barry yester
day afternoon.
, Some weeks ago tbe legal minds who
pracMce in the Police courts were startled
when Prosecuting Attorney Dare of Judee
Joachimsen's court discovered in an old
statute that there was such an offense as
rout; or, in other words, an unexecuted
risfc, and two men were arrested and
charged with the offense. The cases are
still pending.
Justice of tbe Peace Barry's case will
be considerably more of a surprise to the
legal profession and the public generally,
as it is probably the first of its kind on
record.
It is nothing more nor less than a man
suing himself, or in other words he is
both plaintiff and defendant in the suit.
C. A. Reynolds is employed in the
Custom-house. On September 29 last he
sold his warrant for $120 to Joseph E.
Bier and M. M. Regensburger, trading as
money-brokers in the name of Bier &
Reaensburjcer. He got the money and as
security he gave them his note, payable
one month after date, for the amount,
bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent
per month, compounded monthly after
October 30.
When Reynolds got his warrant from
"Washington he cashed it as usual and
failed to hand over tho amount to Bier
& Regensburger.
Since then they have been pressing him
for payment, and he, alarmed al the ex
orbitant rate of interest, consulted an at
torney, and the result was the filing of a
suit against himself in Justice Barry's
court.
In tiie complaint the circumstances of
the sale of the warrant, the granting of
the prdmissory note as security, the rate
of interest compounded and other facts
are given, and then Reynolds confesses
judgment against himself in favor of
BiÂ«r & Regensburger for $120 principal
and $6 interest, the lirst month's interest
of $5 having been deducted from him at
the time he sold his warrant and procured
the money.
The object of Reynolds thus suing him
self is to save himself from paying what
he considers a most exorbitant rate of irf
terest, became by thus confessing judg
ment for $126 Bier <fe Regensburger from
this date can only claim irom him the
usual legal rate of interest of so much per
cent per annum. The code makes provi
sion for such a case, and also for a man
who wants to save himself from incurring
heavy attorney's fees.
Borrowers who are laboring under a
heavy rnte of interest have now a prece
dent for their relief, and they will live to
call the name of Reynolds blessed.
It is Baid that Bier <fe ReeenÃburger
threaten to have Reynolds arrested for
collecting th 9 amount of his warrant, but
it is doubtful if they can find an offense
mentioned to suit the case.
PRESENTATION TO GIBSON
The Electric-Car Men Remember One
of Their Superior* in a Substan
tial Manner.
W. F. Gibson, who occupied the posi
tion of car dispatcher for the electric-car
| line of Mission street, with thebrach lines
i running thereto, all of which are housed
! in the carhouse at Twenty-ninth and
i Mission streets, retired from the com
! pany's service yesterday. On his depar
ture the conductors and motormen, to the
number of 300, presented him with an
elegant gold watch â¢ and chain, with a
charm of the Knights of Pythias attached.
The presentation speech wa3 made by
i Conductor William Kelso on behalf of
i his comrades.
After as many of the hands as could be
' spaced from the running cars had as
i seicbled in the carhouse Mr. Kelso ad".
dressed his late superior in the following
words:
Dear Sir; We the employes of tne Mission
! street brouch of the Slorket-Ureet Railway
Company have assembled here to express our
sincere regret on this the eve of your depart
ure from among us. While you Have" put
i forth your utmost eSorts to promote the very
best Interests ot this company, you have also
given kind consideration toward your subor
dinates. You were firm, yet considerate; if
we had a grievance, you tried to "make it right;
if we had a request to make, you would grant
it If possible; you always had a kind word
and look for each and every one of us. You
have tried to make men of us, both physically,
mentally and morally. You have made us
feel that we were not your subordinates, but
that we were human beings lite yourselfâ
that we had hearts that could feel, and minds
that could reason.
When we look around tnis comfortable and
commodious waiting-room and see our gar
ments neaily hanging ou the wall, our papers,
our- magazines, our toilet soaps and brushes,
our tables and fireside games, a place for
everything and everything in its place, we
know that your kind consideration for our
comfort has done this. It is like home to
those of us who have not a home to go toâ to
those of us whose parents may be far across
the plains or over tte briny-ocean. Wo enn
look back with pleasure and say that we have
been treated humanely and justly. And now
! allow me, in behalf of the employes of vhe Mis
; sion-street carhouse, to present you with this
1 token of our esteem, which we trust you will
j kindly accept, not for its intrinsic value, but
for the spirit in which lt Is given; and .wher
ever you may be placed or whatever position
you may be called upon to fill, it is our sincere
wish that you and your family may have
health, happiness and success.
In response Mr. Gibson, who had been
much affected, responded in suitable lan
guage, thanking the men for their kind
ness to him on his retirement from the
company that he had been connected with
for the past thirteen years.
A line was formed, and as each man
passed and shook the hand of him who
had sent them out each morning to per
form their day's duty, all wished him suc
cess in his future undertaking.
George W. Debenham, who held the
position of dispatcher on the Valencia
street line, has taken Gibson's place.

FIGHTING HAS ONLY JUST
BEEN FAIRLY COMMENCED
Counsel for the Railroad Commissioners Will Meet
To-Day and Confer Upon Their
; Next Move.
Southern Pacific Leases Will Be
Attacked and an Inquiry
Started About Accounts.
RUKTINGTON MAY BE QUERIED
Officials Will Be Examined Regarding
â¢ ' .' the Alleged Deficit for the
Year 1894
The fight between the State Board of
Railroad Commissioners and the Southern
Pacific Company has only began. This
information is derived from snch good
authority that there is no Qhance to ques
" tion its entire accuracy. The effect of the de
cision rendered Monday by Judge McKen
na in the United States Circuit Court was
to dissolve tne injunction. and to leave the
Railroad Commission free to act. subject
to review by any court to wh.ich the
Southern Pacific Company may appeal
from a decision concerning rates.
The important fact having been estab
fchtd that the Railroad Commissioners
hate the constitutional powVr to make
rates and fares for transportation com
panies in this State, the commission has
a- stable t basis for future action. -At least
important considerations will now arise
wuich may be summed up as follows:
1. The validity of the leases of the" Central
i Pacific Railroad Company, the Southern Pa
cific Bailroad. Company^f California, the Cali
fornia -Pacific Railroad-.Company, the South
Pacific Coast Railway Cempany, the Northern
=â¢ California â¢Rhilw.iv -Conrpany, the Oregon 'and
California Railroad Company, the "Southern
â  Pacific Railroad Company of Arizona and the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company of New
Mexico to the sÂ«..utfiera'Pacinc Company Six
of these corporations, the -first six Tamed in ,
the 'or*egoing, have franchises from the State
'of California. Two have. both State and Fed
eral franchises, the Central Pacific Railroad
Company and the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company of California..- One, the Oregon and
California Ranroad Company, is aa Oregon
corporation. â¢ ' .
This matter, which xas brought forward
by A ttorrieyÂ«-Generar Fitzgerald in his ar
gument in the United States Circuit
Court, was not considered by Judge Mc-
Kenna in his decision. But there is no
doubt that the atternevs for the Board of
Railroad Commissioners will proceed to
determine whe'her the leases to the South
ern Pacitie Company are invalid. If the
court should hold that the leases are in
valid the effects of such a decision would
be far reaching, amounting to the practi
cal dismemberment of the Southern Pa
cific Company's carefully .constructed sys
tem in Calilornia and the compulsory op
eration of the California railroads enu
merated as individual lines.
2. The actual truth concerning the expenses
and earnings ot- the lines of the Southern Pa
rific Company, upon which showing the rates
to some extent may depend. - |
It is an open secret t' at at least one of
the attorneys for the' Board of Railroad
Commissioners disbelieves that the show
ing made up by he bookkeeping depart
ment of the Southern Pacific Company for
legal use is true. To ascertain the truth it
will be necessary to have the Southern
Pacific Company's books and the book- of
.â  the leased Jines and the Southern Pacific
Company's officials "in court for examina
tion. It is credibly learned tliat the
attorneys for the Board of Railroad Com
missioners are inclined to this course, the
idea being to subject all figures and state
ments made in support of the Southern
Pacific's Company's alleged basis of ratÂ»s
to the most thorough scrutiny and inves
tigation. ,
<$. An investigation into the combination of
transportation iines in California in restraint
of competition.
While the second matter, the investiga
tion of books, papers accounts and per
sons, may excite more general interest
than ihe others, it will be concede:', that
the first is of the greater importance.
Attorney-Genera! Fitz erald absolutely
refused yesterday to be interviewed con
cerning the next step to be taken by- coun
sel for the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners. He would not go on record as
saying anything about the matter. At
torney-General Fitztjerald, W. W. Foote
and Robert Y. Hayne will meet to confer
together to-day with the Raiiroad Com
missioners. Only the preliminary matter
was disposed of in the United States Cir
cuit Court. An answer to the Southern
Pacific Comnanv will be fi'ed, and the
true nierits of the situation will be con
sidered, as outlined in the foreeoing.
The invalidity of the leases of the Cali
fornia roads to the Southern Pacific Com?
pany was urged by Attorney-General
FiiSirerald as a matier of great^import
ance before Judere McKenna. What was
then said is of interest once more, be
cause the arguments are the basis, of tbe
move to have the different lines operated
separately. Attorney Fitzgerald said:
The leÃses from the six California cnrpora
t!ons â namely, the Central Pacific Railroad
Company, the Southern Pacific Railroad Â«"om
pany of Caliiornia, the Calitorni Pacific Rail
road Company, the South Pacific Coast Rail
way Company, the Northern Rai'wav Com
pp.ny and tbe Northern California Railway
Companyâ we shall c^aim are void, because, ac
I have before said, they were executed with
out the express consent of the authority grant
ine those franchises.
Toe leases from the two corporations exer
cisine Federal franchisesâ the Central Pacific
Railroad Company and the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company of California â we will
claim are void, because those leases were exe
cuted without express Congressional author
. ity.
The leases from the California Pacific Rail
road Company and the South Pacific Coast
Railway Company we shad contend are void
for the following reasons: Those two leases
wen 1 executed to the complainant prior to the
amendment to its charter, passed by the Legis
lature of Kentucky in March, 1888. The act
of the Kentucky Legislature granting this
charter was originally passed on March 17.
1884.
Befors th's amendment to the charter was
passed by the Kentucky Legislature these two
leases were executed by the California Pacific
Railroad Company and the South Pacific Coast
Railway Company to the complainant here.
The California Pacific Railroad Company's
lease was executed November 1, 1886, two
yer.rs before the amendment to the charter.
The South Pacific Coast Railway company's
lease was executed on July 1, 1887, nearly one
year prior to the passage of the amendment to
the charter which was originally granted by
the Legislature of Kentucky to the com
plainant.
In that connection, if the court please,
with reference to those last two leases, we will
assume the position that, at the time they
were executed to the complainant, the com
plainant tiad no power or authority to cuter
into contracts of thut character, or of any
othor character, in the State ol California.
The omnibus lease from the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company o; California, the Southern
I'HCific Railroad Company of Arizona, the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company of New
Mexico, and the two Louisiana corporations',
Â«c will contend is void, for the reason that it
is iii palpable violation of section 20 of article
XII of the constitution of this State.
Tbe investieation into the books and
accounts cf the Southern Pacific Cornoany
may determin â  whether there was an ac
tual deficit by the operation of tbe roads
of the Pacific system controlled by the
Southern Pac. tic Company during the
year 1895. On this point tbe investigation
of the statement made by C. P. Hunting
ton to the English bondholders may lead
to placing Mr. Huntington upon the wit
ness-stand. A portion of Mr. Hunting
ton's written statement to tbe bond
holders was quoted by Attorney-General
Fitzg raid in tbe United StateÃ Circuit
Court, as follows:
An improvement in the general business
situation in the States traversed by these lines
begun to manifest itsplf shortly after the be
ginning of the year 1895, which was followed
by an improvement of earnings. In January,
1895, the gross earning* ot the lines constitut
ing the Southern Pacific system snow a gain
of $290,597 03; in February, a gain of
$284,678 36, and the estimated grosss earn
ings for the month of March show a gain ol
$145,993.
In view of this showing for two months
and one part of another in 1895 of a gain
over the corresponding months of 1894 ag
gregating $721,^68 39, the attorneys for the
Railroad Commissioners think that there
should be an inquiry as to the alleged de
ficit of over $552,000 in 1895 wh^n there
was a surplus oi $1,200,000 in 1894.
The claim that me combination of the
various lines is unlawful and in violation
of section 20 of article XII of the constitu
tion of the State will be once more urged.
The plans of the attorneys for the Railroad
Commissioners in detail will be deter
mined at conferences in which the Com
missioners will participate.
HELD FOR CRUNG'S MURDER.
Judgn Joacbinisen Passes on the Lee
Hock Murder Case.
Judge Joachimsen on Monday heard the
final arguments of Attorneys Charles B.
Darwin and John Â£. Richards for the
prosecution and defense respectively in
the case of the People against Lee Hock,
alias Lee Ah Lucy, for the murder of Ah
Chung, on October 6. After reviewing the
case the Judge held the defendant to an
swer on the ground of probable cause.
At tornev Darwin took the ground that
delendant?s guilt was foreshadowed by the
fact of his silence in the presence of the
dying man, who was accusing him of the
shooting. The attorney argued that the
silence was a strong circumstance indicat
ing euilt.
Attorn Richards thanked the court
for its.great diligence In studying the evi
dence, but arsued that the evidence of ail
the white witnesses tended strongly to ex
onerate the defendant, while the state
ment of the State's chief Chinese witness
was in direct conflict with the statement
made by deceased just before he died.
The attorney accounted for defendant's
flight after the shot on the ground that
flight from such scenes is common among
Chinese, and that six others fled at the
same time.

Mystery deep and impenetrable still en
shrouds the mysterious client of ex-Attor

equally mysterious cfisers of the upper
air.
From Oakland com Â£i; s a tale told by the
son of Professor Gi'^on of the Normal
Training School that U the most startling
yet contributed to thr Subject. He claims
to have seen the aei"il wonder at short
range and gives what hÂ« earnestly asserts
is a detailed description of the flier in full
flight.
Other interior poll also send reports
of aerial moving lij tits which are sup
posed to belong to i^ma aerial craft or
crafts.
"I have heard noth bg from the inven
tor of the airship fc* 1 some days," said
General Hart yesterd Ay, "and from the re
ports received by T^ik Call I have no
doubt he is experimenting in the dry and
high altitudes of the interior, as he told
me he intended to do.*' This vas all the
attorney for the mysterious inventor of
the equally mysterious aeriel craft had to
say on tbe subject yesterday, though he
expects to be able to give some additional
interesting information in a few days.
SAW THE AIRSHIP.
Graphic Tale Told by a Son of Pro
fessor Gilson of the Normal
Train ing- School.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. I.â Case Gilson,
a young electrician of this city, declares
that he has seen the airship at close range
and is able to describe it.
Case Gilson is a son of Professor Gilson,
ex-Superintendent of Schools and princi
pal of the Normal Training-school. His
testimony is supported by other young
men who saw the strange aerial navigator
at the same time.
"The airship was moving very rapidly
from the southeast toward Lorin, and not
a light was visible," said Gilson. "It was
about 1000 or IfOO feet in the air and
looked like a great black cigar with a fish
lite tail. If it had side propellers they
were revolving so rapidly that I could not
see them. The body was at least a hun
dred feet long, and attached to it was a
triangular tail, one apex being attached to
the mam body. The surtace of the air
ship looked as if it were made of alu
minum, which exposure to wind and
weather had turned dark. I saw all this
distinctly, and I am willing to take any
oath to the truth of what I say.
"The airship went at a tremendous
speed. As it neared Lorin it turned
quickly and disappeared in the direction
of San Francisco. At half-past Bwe saw
it again, when it took about the same di
rection and disappeared. I have studied
the subject of airships to a certain extent
and I see no reason why one should not
be successful. I know that I was not
mistaken about the airship and took a
kite for the real thing. It was an airship ;
of that I am convinced."
Gilson and his friends saw the airship
twice during last Thursday evening at 8
and 8:30 o'clock. The skies were perfectly
clear, and a strong northwest wind was
blowing. The airship was moving rapidly
from the southeast toward the north in
tbe teeth of the wind. No heat was visi
ble, merely the weird, peculiar body
silhoueted against the clear skies. Case
Gilson, his brother, and the Petan broth
ers distinctly saw the strange sight, and
Gilson describes its appearance very
graphically.
Gilson is at present tbe only person in

A CONFIDENTIAL CHAT
between two men or women generally de-
velops the fact that one or both are troubled
by sickness of some kind. One man is all
right except his rheumatism, another has a
"slight touch " of dyspepsia, another has
bilious headaches, and another is too nerv-
ous to sleep well. What's to be done about it?
The situation is serious. Little things
have a way of getting big. Big diseases are
bad things. Sleeplessness brings irritable
nerves, loss of flesh, loss of appetite. Sleep-
less people soon get their bodies into such
a condition that disease-germs j find it easy
to lodge there and propagate. People die
from the aggravation of an aggregation of lit-
tle things. The more promptly a disease or
disorder is met the more, quickly it is cured.
.- Most all sickness starts in the stomach,
liver or lungs. Rheumatism, scrofula, ec-
zema, consumption^ come about â¢ because
insufficient, impure or impoverished blood
is present. The diseased , blood '. finds the
weakest spot in the body and a local symp-
tom appears. "â  If the impurity is supplanted
with good, rich, red, healthy corpuscles,
the disease will have nothing to feed on.
If the proper cleansing medicine is sent to
the seat of the trouble, it will ' force out the
germs and repair the damage done.
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery is
a cleansing, purifying medicine, a blood
enricher, a nerve strengthener. It is an
efficient tonic, aids digestion, creates
healthy appetite and healthy flesh. :â * It
does not make ,â  people "fat." I It makes
them st/ong. It makes useful â solid
muscle. â¢ It will cure any sickness that
has its source in the â¢ digestive ' organs, or
through them in the blood.

Another Scalp to Those Now in His
Belt by To-Nighfs Fight. .

Oakland who has openly declared that
the machine was visible on a clear night.
Its previous appearances have been on
cloudy, obscure nights, when persons may
have been misled by taking stars for elec
tric lights and clouls for the shadowy
form of an airship. Gilson is also an ama
teur astronomer and declares that be
could not mistake a star or a cloud for an
airship.
Percy Drew was another individual
favored with a glimpse of the airship. He
says it visited Oakland Saturday night.
It then carried a red light and moved
with its usual quickness. Both young
men agree that the ship was of enormous
size, measuring at least 100 feet in length.
OVER THE CAMPUS.
Skeptical Students See the Alleged
Cruiser of the Upper Air.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
1. â Those mysterious lights Bupposfcd to
be a part of the airship were visible to
several students on the campus here last
night about 10:30 o'clock, and their ex
citement was intense. Most of those who
saw the lights sweep across the sky have
heretofore been most skeptical about the
existence of any such creation as an air
ship, and it is amusing to note their un
certainty, now that their own eyes have
witnessed the peculiar lights.
Among those who saw the inexplicable
lights are R. S. Gartield, C. F. Aaron and
H. H. Hiudry. Ordinarily the announce
ment by some ot" the students that they
had seen the airship would be received
with a wink, or a counter remark on
"wheels that needed oiling," a comment
on tbe virtue cf temperance; but Hindry,
Garfield and Aaron are reputed to be little
given to practical joking and absolutely
MARTIN JULIAN'S OPINION ON THE FIGHT.
Owing to the cold which Bob contracted about a week ago he is not in quite so good con
dition as 1 would like to have him. Notwithstanding that fact 1 think he will win to-morrow
night's contest with very little trouble.
The reason why he' is hardly in the condition 1 would be pleased to have him is not for lack of
work, because he has done plenty of that, but is owing to the changeable weather we have experi
enced here in Sausalito. But as I said before, taking everything into consideration, I think he will
win inside of four rounds.
I think Sharkey and his backer have acted very peculiarly. At every point they have raised
all possible objections to all fair and square propositions regarding the selection of a referee. They
have refused Hiram Cook positively and, in fact, have objected strenuously to talking on the ref
eree question.
lam going to try them again to-morrow morning and see what can be done in this matter. Ido
not want the club to select the referee if I can possibly help it. We are not particular about the
referee so long as he understands the rules and has a reputation to lose by making a bad decision.

free from any other characteristics that
might make their story incredible.
Hindry was rather averse to talking
about what he had seen, but as it had
somehow reached the ears of all the
students, he thought best to give an ac
count of it. In substance he stated that
he was looking out of his window when
some one called his attention to the pecu
liar antics of one of the lights in the
heavens, resembling a very large star or
planet. "I watched the lisht pointed out
and thought it was a planet at first, but
when the darn thing began to rise and
sink and to shoot rapidly from one side
to the other I knew enough about astron
omy to know that it was no star or planet.
I rubbed my eyes to make sure I really
saw what I thought I saw, but when I
opened them it was still there and con
tinued itsdartings about for some minutes,
though constantly receding and growing
dimmer.
"It was high in the air and apparently
many miles off when we saw it, and was
going in a northerly direction toward San
Francisco. I'll swear I don't know whether
it was a real airship or a 'fake.' I'm in
clined to think it might have been a bal
loon, but it mo\ed in such a peculiar
manner."
R. S. Garneld also saw the light, and
fully corroborated Hindry's accounts of
its appearance and motions, "The light
was in a part of the heavens where there
was no other large star, and it was so
noticeable that I watched it, thinking it a
planet and wondering which one it could
be. Then it commenced to rise and sink,
and a little later flew off at a tangent as
though struck by a gust of wind. 1 called
up my roommate and let several other
fellowa know about it, and we watched it
until it faded away in the distance. I
wouldn't bet that it was an airship, but if
it was not it was a most ingenious con
trivance and gave a very powerful light."
C. F. Aaron is quite communicative
about it, and is sure be saw, if not the air
ship, at least the same light that has been
exciting the public for two weeks past.
Neither he nor any of the other spectators
claim they could distinguish any form

above or about the. light with Which it
might be connected. All are hopeful that
it may be visible again soon to all, for

guying at the hands of their more skep
tical friends.
IN MERCED'S SKY.
The San Joaquln Valley Treated to
a Sight of the Aerial Lights.
MERCED, CaiÂ», Dec I.â Merced was
treated to a visit last night by the airstiip
that has been provoking so much discus
sion. A bright, red light appeared in the
sky to the west of the town about 8:15
o'clock. Observers at first" thought that it
was a particularly bright star, but as they
watched it the light grew larger and
brighter and other lights showed them
selves bn the mysterious visitor. It came
in from the west, circled to the north over
the town, and seemed to rest in its flight
about over the center of the business por
tion of Merced.
Among the observers of the phenomenon
were T. M. Edmunds (tbe Wells-Fargo
agent) and J. H. Olcese (a prominent Mer
ced merchant). Mr. Olcese noticed it as
he was on his road home, and called the
members of a dramatic club, who were re
hearsing in the opera-bouse, to see the
lights. At that time tbe flying wonder
was headed for the noith and was rapidly
passing out of sight, the watchers keeping
it in sight until it had grown to be quite a
small speck in the darkness.
Some skeptics scouted the idea of its
being an airship, and maintained that it
was a large star, but tbe light was too
large and brilliant for that. Others
stoutly declared that it was a balloon sent
up by some practical joker, but the light
was visible too long for such an explana-
tion. What served to attract the greatest
amount of attention was the peculiar
quality of the light, which did not present
the characteristics of the ordinary electric
light or of the gaslights that people are
accustomed to. Many who were inclined
to be skeptical beforehand are now firm
believers in the existence of this wonder
ful and mysterious visitant.
ABOVE HIGH MOUNTAINS.
Two Mysterious Lights Over Rob
inson's Ferry, Calaveras County.
About the time the airship is said to
have taken its flight to the southern part
of the State lights were seen over several
localities in the course indicated. Accord
ing to W. H. H. Hart the inventor desired
to test his ship in the higher altitudes.
Whether he went as far east as ihe foot
hills of the Sierras is a matter of conjec
ture. However, P. F. Perryman of Cala
veras County claims to have seen the
lights of the mystery of the sky, for he
sends the following latter to Thk Call:
Robinsons Ferry, Calaveras Cot'ntt, )
Nov. 26, 1896. |
Five miners here and myself last night saw
the two lights, which we believe were attached
to an airship. The one light in advance in the
direction in which they were traveling con
vinced me that it was of an electrical char
acter. It would be steady for a while and then
die out. The other light, which seemed to be
of a different character, containing more
orange rays, remained equidistant from the
other in its career through the air. Both
lights oscillated up and down in passing
across our vision in a direction from left to
right looking down the river. These lights
were a considerable distance off and seemed to
be at a considerable elevation. They remained
in view but a very few minutes, passing out of
sight behind the hills forming the river canyon
walls on the right looking down stream. You
mpy use this letter as you please, as it is no
fake and I am willing to make affidavit to the
facts contained herein. P. F. Ferryman.

Not Likely to Agree on
a Referee.

An Eastern Man Is Being Held

THE BETTING ON THE FIGHT.
The Cornishman's Narrow Escape
From Death at His Training
Quarters.
It is a foregone conclnsioh that the rep
resentatives of the two pugilists â Fitzsim
mons and Sharkey â who are to meet to-
nicht in a ten-round sparring contest at
the Mechanics' Pavilion, will not be able
to agree upon a referee.
Martin Julian for Fitzsimmons ex
hausted his list when he named Hiram
Cook as his choice, and Danny Lynch for
Sharkey says he has no choice at all, be
cause he knows no man here well enough
to name him as a competent referee.
"I don't want to cast any aspersions on
Mr. Cook," Lynch said last night.
'No doubt he's a eood man, honest and
capable. He has shown himself as such
when he refereed the fiphts at the old
California Athletic Club; but I don't want
him to act in this case.
"Well, yes," said the little manager, "I
have a good reason for not wanting Cook
as referee. I cannot make a move but
some one comes aloug and 'plugs' Cook
up to me as the best and only man to get.
Some of the 'pluggers' I know to be ene
mies of Sharkey and of mine, and I don't
see why they are so anxious now for our
welfare."
This referee question is now one of the
two main points at issue before the fight
ers step into the ring.
Sbarkey and Lynch aver that each time
when the former met Choynski and after
ward Corbett, he was defrauded of his
rightful victory by reason of* a wrong de
cision. Hence, in this, the battle of the
sailor lad's life, they want a man they are
satisfied will be honest and impartial.
On the other hand, Martin Julian, who
settles all business matters for Fitzsim
mons, is positive that his principal cannot
lose the battle in a fair fight. He does not
want a referee who can be intimidated
into allowing foul tactics, but one who will
be strong-minded enough to decide against
the foul fighter at any stage of the ten
rounds.
At all events the referee question will be
decided at noontime to-day. At 11 o'clock
in the morning the parties interested will
come together and will have one hour in
which to make a selection, aud failing,
the matter will revert to the club man
agers.
The next main point will be the de
positing of fSOOO with Jim Ches'ey, the
stakeholder. He has already received
$5000, and the sum total will be in his
hands in time to depos.it it in bank and
at tbe ring3ide hand over to the referee a
certified check for $10,000 to be given the
winner as he leaves the ring.
Manager Gibbs, in speaking on the sub
ject last night, stated :
"There cannot possibly be a hitch in re
gard to the referee. If the boys do not
agree the matter will be left to us, and we
are fully prepared to meet it.
"The referee we have in view has not
yet been mentioned to any one, therefore
he has not been refused by either side.
We would not propose a man who has
been rejected. The man we have in view
is a stranger in this City, but he is so well
known the world over as an honest and
capable man that we have no hesitancy in
saying now he will be acceptable to both
principals and the public."
From the present outlook the National
Athletic Club managers have $20,000 in
sight. Aside from the purse they hung up
there is $7000 expenses. There are 12,
-000 chairs and 2000 bench seating capacity
in the Pavilion, and the prices range from
$2 to $10 per seat There are, therefore,
many hundreds of good seats still to be
obtained.
That the battle is regarded with wide
spread Interest goes without saying. Dar
ing the past three days over 100 tickets
have been sold to lady purchasers. Twice
that number have been sold in China
town. â¢
Nearly all the big Eastern newspapers
have arranged to have from 2000 to 10,000
words about the fight wired from the ring-
Bide.
Captain Wittman will be in charge of a
squad of nfty policemen, who will keep
order inside the Pavilion, while P. D. Lin
ville and his squad of twenty-five special
officers will patrol the outside and the roof
of the building.
Dan Lynch dropped into Corbett's bet
ting headquarters last night and turned
away in disgust.
"I can't see for the life of me why Fitz
simmons is such a. strong favorite. .If
these men were sized up like horses, on
form, the battinp odds should be reversed.
Sharkey should be selling favorite at 2
to 1."
Considerable money in small amounts
is going into the pool boxes. The betting
is mainly on whether Sharkey will last
six rounds. Fitzsimmons' backers are
wagerine $10 to $9 that be will not. Ten
dollars to $4 is the regular betting on the
result.
The Civic Federation met yesterday and
appointed Rev. Dr. Dille, I. T. Truman,
Gilbert Sexton and C. H. Perkins a com
mittee to wait on Chief Crowley and en
deavor to persuade him to stop the fight.
A NARROW ESCAPE.
FltzÃlmmons Nearly Run Down by
an Excited Horse.
Fitzsirnmons had the narrowest escape
from serious injury he ever had in all his
life yesterday, as he himself admits. If
it had not been for his presence of mind
Sharkey would have appeared at the Pa
vilion to-night to find no opponent.
He was just entering Sausalito from his
training jaunt to Mill Valley- when, he was
overtaken by a runaway horse, attached
to a buggy, in which were Lillian Shoo
bert, the young daughter of Mr. Sboobert
of <he firm of Shoobert & fieale, Marian
Harrison, daughter of J. W. Harrison, the
coal-dealer, and a small Portuguese lad.
Fitz heard the sound of the horse's hoofs
and glancing back comprehended his
dangerous position just in time to jump to
one side and let the rig pass.
As the maddened animal rushed by him
Bob let out to catch it by the reins and
stop its course, but before he could over
take the horse it ran into Louis Zaro, a
messenger-boy, who carries the mail from
the boat to the postoflice. Zaro, who was
riding a bicycle, was hurled to one side
and badiy bruised.
The shock of the impact was such as
to throw all the children from the buggy.
The little Portuguese lad sustained a deep
cut in the forehead fr.om striking a stone.
Miss Sboobert was severely bruised and
fainted from pain. Bob placed her in the
Sheriff's buggy and drove her to a drug
store, where she was found to be all right,
with the exception of a few bad contu
sions.
'â¢That was the narrowest escape T ever
had," said Bob, in describing the scene.
"If that bloody 'orse's bloomin' 'oofs had
struck me, right would have been out of
the question.
"My wife was driving along in a buggy
behind me with the baby in her lap, and
heard the animal coming just in time to
turn out of the road. As it was, a wheel
of her bugcy was struck with sufficient
force to lift the vehicle a couple of leet off
the ground."
"JUST AS GOOD AS NEW."
This Applied to Those Sets of the Ency
clopaedic Dictionary.
Readers will remember the recent great
distribution by the Pacific Coast News
paper Syndicate, which resulted in plac
ing in many hundreds of homes that !
splendid reference work, the Encyclopaedic j
Dictionary.
In the course of the distribution, which
involved the handling, packing and un
packing of many thousands of tt-ese sets, j
now and then a volune in some set was !
rubbed slightly, and therefore withheld j
from shipment. Those sets, of course, j
might be rebound and sent out, out the
syndicate, instead of doing this, proposes
to distribute them at a nominal price.
ThÂ« most serious injury to any set is no
greater than might occur in a few days'
use in one's home or office.
They are, in fact, 'just as good as new"
for ail practical purposes, and readers will
be glad to know that one of these special
sets can now be had at an exceptionally i
low price and on easy terms of payment.
One dollar is all the cash required, and j
the full set delivered at once, with the j
privilege of returning within a week and {
money refunded.
The Syndicate's address is No. 14 San
some street, where application may be j
made either personally or by letter, but, as â¢
the number of these speoial sets is limited, j
and as they will be distributed to the first
