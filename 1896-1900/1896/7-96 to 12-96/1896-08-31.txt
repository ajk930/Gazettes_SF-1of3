HONEST-COIN
DEMOCRATS.
All Ready for the Sound-
Money Convention at
Indianapolis.
IT WILL BE A NOTABLE
GATHERING.
Eminent Men From Nearly
Every State in the Union
Are Delegates.
BRAGG AND BUCKNER FAVORED
FOR THE TICKET.
The Florida Delegation Will Go to
the Convention With a Grover
Cleveland Banner.
INDIANAPOLIS, Iro., Aug. 3aâ The
movement that brought into being the
convention of the National Democratic
party, wnich will be called to order in
Tomlinson Hall at noon Wednesday next,
started with the adoption of the platform
by the Chicago Democratic Convention.
No definite steps were taken, however, un
til July 19, when W. D. Bynum, John P.
Prenzel. John B. Wilson, John T. Dye and
Evans Woollen sent out from this city
telegrams asking for a conference of sound
money Democrats at Chicago.
From that day the movement has de
veloped so rapidly that now the National
Democracy is organized in forty-one
Mate*, all of which, it is said, will be
represented by full delegations in the con
vention this week. Mr. Bynum, as chair
man of the executive committee, has been
busy almost night and day iv pushing the
organization and he has had the active
support and assistance of many of the
ablest Democratic politicians in tbe
country.
Secretary Wilson of the National Com
mittee tbis evening completed making up
the temporary roll of the convention, so
far as be could go, until tbe Tuesday meet
ing of the National Committee. The fol
lowing States have certified the names of
full delegations elected: California, Con
necticut, Illinois, Indiana, lowa, Kansas,
K"~ntncky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Micbigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylva
nia, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota. Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, West
Virginia â twenty-nine in all.
The following States hare notified the
executive committee that they bave
elected delegations, but have not yet sent
in their lists: Alabama, Colorado, Dela
ware, Florida, Nebraska, New fiamp-
Buire, Virginia and Washington.
These States will, it is expected, elect
to-morrow: Sew York, Arkansas, Mis
sissippi and Montana, making a total of
forty-one States, and leaving Idaho,
Wyoming, Nevada and Utah as the States
which will not take part in the conven
tion.
The convention will be notable in one
or two other particulars aside from the
suddenness with whicu it has been
brought together. It will have no con
tending factions nor opposing ambitions
and it wili contain more notable men than
any of those held this year. The speeches
to be delivered at the Wednesday night
mass-meeting by Ebrich, Fellows, Breck
iaridge, Eckels and Outhwaite are looked
forward to as notable contributions to the
sound-money literature of the campaign.
W. J. Curtis o! New Jersey, one of the
leaders of the sound-money movement in
the Democratic party of this State, arrived
in the city this afternoon. He said the
full delegation of twenty men from New
Jersey would be here and that a number
of others inierested in the movement
would attend the convention.
"The movement in New Jersey," he
said, "is widespread and powerful. Of the
fourteen members of the State Committee
when the committee voted as to whetber
or not it snould support Bryan, three
voted absolutely against such a course
and one failed to vote."
"We have three of them now on our
State committee and the secretary and
chairman of tbe old State committee are
only waiting for the State convention
for the election of electors-at-laree
to leave the old party and identify them
selves with the new movement. I use the
term old party as referring to what is gen
erally spoken of as the Democratic party,
but we do not recognize it as the Demo
cratic party at all. We look upon the ad
herents to the Chicago Platform as the
bolters, and as a matter of fact tbey are
bolters in New Jersey, for they left the
principles whicu tiie Democrats of the
State nad already declared for.
"Wnois the preference of New Jersey
for the presidential nomination?" was
asked Mr. Curtis.
"I cannot speak for the delegation," he
answered, "as we have bad no conferences
and every man comes Iree to cast bis vote
as he chooses. I ca.i say, however, that
we will probably be united and our princi
pal aim, perhaps, will be to add strength
to the strongest man. Personally I be
lieve that General Palmer would make the
ideal candidate.
"General Bragg is a man of whom I am
very fond and a man who wouid do honor
to the ticket. Watterson is very popular
and would make a very acceptable candi
date to many and there is only one reason
that I could offer for not supporting him
for tbe nomination. Coming from the
same State as General Buckner his nomi
nation for the Presidency wouid defeat
Buckner's nomination *O" <h Vice-Presi
dency and I hope to see General Buckner
get that nomination."
Tbe Florida delegation will come to the
convention to support Grover Cleveland
for tbe Presidential nomination. To-day
a telegram was received by Mr. Taggart
at the Grand Hotel from Mr. Arthur
The San Francisco Call.
Meigs, chairman of the delegation, asking
that a banner be prepared for the delega
tion. The banner is to be of white tilk
with a gold border, containing in the cen
ter the portarit of Cleveland and inscribed
with the words "Our Candidate." Mr.
Meigs requested that the banner be sent
to the Union station to meet the delega
tion at 11:50 o'clock Tuesday morning.
Chairman Bynum returned to-day from
Bradford Junction, Ohio, where he spoke
last night to a meeting composed largely
of railroad men. He says there were 4000
people in the orowd, three special trains
Having brought large numbers from the
surrounding country. The meeting was
to him, at least, a very satisfactory dem
onstration of the interest of the people in
the cause of sound money.
Senator Donelson Caffery of Louisiana,
who is to be permanent chairman of the
convention, is expected to reach Indian
apolis to-morrow.
Ex - Governor Flower, the temporary
chairman, wili not arrive here until Tues
day.
The impression prevails to-night that
the ticket is likely to be Bragg and Buck
ner.
Mr. Curtis of New Jersey expressed his
satisfaction with it, especially with the
selection of Buckner, and the Kansas dele
gation are quoted in support of tbe two
'B's."
Mr. Bynum was asked to-night if the
ticket nominated here this week would be
heard from in the electoral college.
"Certainly," he promptly responded.
"It will carry four States. 11
"What are they ?"
"Florida, Alabama and Texas are three
of them."
Nothing is known here of the intentions
of President Cleveland regarding the con
vention and its work. No one so far on
the ground has received any communica
tion from him; at least, none that has
even been whispered of in private con
ferences.
Some people think it probable that
Comptroller Eckels, who will be here to
morrow, has a message from the President
or is authorized to speak for him in some
way that will be satisfactory to the dele
gates.
McKINLEY'S MODESTY.
Chameterittie Reply to Words of Praise
from a friend.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 30.â Major Mc-
Kinley spent a very quiet Sunday. The
greater part of his mail was piled on his
desk untouched, waiting for to-morrow.
Only the most important of telegrams
were answered. The Major had for his
Truest Hon. Benjamin Butterworth, who
is on his way to the Northwest, where he
will go on tbe stump for the Republican
party. Major Butterworth accompanied
Major McKinley to church this morning,
where they listened to a sermon by Bishop
Mils. To-night Major Butterworth spoke
most eloquently of his distinguished host.
"I was going to church with him tbis
morning, aud as we walked along the
quiet shady street I took occasion to say
to him that his name was on every tongue
and that he was known in every land, and
â Â«.!>keii him if tb*X fact did not tend to
exalt him in bis own eyes.
" 'No,' he said, "if it tends to do any
thing it makes me more sensible of my
shortcomings and causes me to seek with
greater earnestness tban in ail my life to
learn the way in which my feet should go.
Never before have 1 felt the need of
strength and wisdom as I bave these last
two months, and never have I been so
sensible of my own weakness.' "

Mrs. Bryan attended service at the First

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 30.â The
Herald this morning says: President
Cleveland's visit to this city yesterday, the
prime object of which was the reception
of the Chines Embassador, afforded him
at the same time at) excellent opportunity

State Supreme Court yesterday an
nounced his fealty to the Demo
cratic party, and declined the nomi
nation of the Gold Democrats. "Why

LONDON, Eiro., Aug. 30.â The Standard
will publish to-morrow a dispatch from
Madrid, saying that the Spani-h Govern
ment has expressed approval of the decree
which Captain-General Weyler has de
cided to issue, suspending the work of
gathering the coffee crop in Cuba, and
also of his action in forbidding Spaniards
and foreigners to hold any dealings with
the insurgents. The dispatch alto says
the American Consuls in Cuba have pro
tested against the inforcement of the
latter order, upon the ground that it.
would prevent them from securing infor
mation that tbe State Department at
Washington required and would be con
ducive to demands for indemnity by
American citizes, whose property suffered
in consequence of the carrying oat of the
order.
WAGING WA R O N WET LER
Havana Spaniard* May Demand That
Me Be Recalled..
KEY WEST, Fla., Aug. 30.â Great ex
citement prevails in Havana over Wey
ler's decree in regard to the sugar and
coffee crops. It is believed that, if issued,
tbe decree will be strongly opposed. Seri
ous complications are expected from the
Spanish element. It is rumored that the
Conservative party held a secret meeting
last night and decided to ask the home
Government for Weyier's recall, and if re
fused to forcibly expel him, as was done
to General Dulce in the last war.
It is understood that Consul Lee has
strongly protested against the notice
posted at the entrance to Cabana Fortress,
stating if the American Consul presented
himself there to detain and arrest him.
Lee has also demanded that Weyler make
a full investigation of Charles Govin's
death.
It is further reported that Quintln Ban
dera and sixty followers have crossed the
southern section of the trocha and are now
operating around Pozo Redondo and that
Bandera will assume command of the
forces in Havana province, heretofore
under General Zavas, who was killed in a
recent engagement.
AERONAUT BALDWIN'S FALL
He Receives Injuries Which Will Doubtless
Prove Fatal â Sad End to a Ro
mantic Career.
DENVER, Colo., Aue. 30.â Sergeant Ivy
Baldwin, attached to the Signal Service of
the Department of the Colorado, fell from
his balloon while making an ascension at
Ki itch's Gardens to-day and will probably
die from bis injuries. As the balloon was
released and rushed upward a sudden gust
of w:nd blew the aeronaut, swinging from
a trapeze, against a tree, the shock dazing
him so that be lost his presence of mind,
and when above the treetops : c let go his
hold, failing a distance of forty feet.
Both arms were broken, a hip dislocated
and one eye wan seriously wounded. He
was taken to St. Anthony's Hospital,
where he lies unconscious.
Ivy Baldwin has had a romantic career,
having given balloon exhibitions all over
ttie world. About two years ago Captain
W. A. Giasford, who has been experi
menting with balloons as a means of sig
naling in army work, induced Baldwin to
enlist, and his practical Knowledge of bal
looning has been of great value. The
aeronaut has been taking great interest in
the equipment of the new balloon park at
Fort Logan, where practical operations
were soon to be inaugurated.

PRINCE LOBANOFF
DIES SUDDENLY.
Foreign Minister and Chan
cellor of the Russian
Empire.
ON HIS WAY TO KIEF.
Traveling With the Czar aod
Czarina en Their Tour
of Europe.
A MAN OF STRONG CHARACTER
Cool ' Headed and Clear â¢ Sighted He
Was Never Swerved From
His Purpose.
LONDON, Esq., Aug. 30.â The Daily
Telegraph to-morrow will publish a Kief
dispatch saying that Prince Loban< ff-
Rostovski, the Russian Minister of For
eign Affairs, who accompanied the Czar
and Czarina on their recently begun
foreign tour, died suddenly to-day while
on his way from Vienna to Kief.
Prince Lobanoff's nomination to the
Chancellorship of the Russian Empire
marked tbe inauguration of a new era in
Muscovite politics. M. de Giers was con
l tent wit i a perfectly passive role while at
the bead of the Department of Foreign
Affairs, leaving all tbe initiative to the
late Czar, who retained in his own hands
the direction of Russia's international re
lations, while Prince Gortscnakoff â at any
rate, during the last decade of his life
was so much absorbed by questions con
cerning his failing health and by his
quest for pleasure that he had but little
time to devote to the affairs of state, tbe
administration of which he abandoned to
subordinates, who were naturally afraid
to assume any responsibility.
Prince Alexander Lobanoff-Rostovski,
however, was a man of a very different
stamp. Masterful in character, cool
beaded and clear-sighted, he would not
permit himself to be swayed by any oneâ
not even by the Czar himselfâ from the
course which, upon mature reflection, he
had decided to be the right one to adopt.
Unlike the majority of bis countrymen, he
never gave way to impulse, never lost his
temper and never manifested any of that
passionate enthusiasm to which the Slavs
are so prone. Nothing ever seems to dis
turb his equanimity, while his inde
pendence of character was something ab
solutely unique in a Russian. Possessed
of a vast fortune, as well as of a lineage
which, extending back to Rurik, is, from a
Russian point of view, superior even to
that of the Emperor, he regarded himself
as fully tbe latter's equal as far as blood
and ancestry are concerned.
Prince Lobanoff, when Embassador at
Vienna, received a '.eleg'-ani from the
Grand Duke Nicolas Mcolaievitch, in
which the brother of Alexander II an
nounced the hour of his arrival and de
manded that Prince Lobanoff should meet
dim at the station. Without betraying
any sign of irritation at tbe arrogant tone
of tbe dispatch, he contented himself with
sending an attache to the terminus to
meet tbe Grand Duke, and to inform him
that he wojild be pleased to see him at the
embassy. He would not even call upon
Nicolas at his hotel, but waited at home
to receive the visit of his Imperial High
ness, whom he greeted on tbe threshold
of his library with that urbanity which
characterized bis manner to high and
low alike.
Not a word of *poloey did he offer for
having neglected to obey the behests of
the Grand Duke, and that tbe latter might
be under no misapprehension as to the
receipt of his message, he had taken care
to lay the telegraphic dispatch on the
desk ; n such a manner tnat its contents
could not fail to catch the eye of any one
entering the room.
Tbe Grand Duke took his les'on meekly,
nor did he ever take more trouble than
on this occasion to express hia regard for
the Embassador. who subsequently heard
privately from St. Petersburg that Alex
ander 111 had been .delighted with the
snub administered to his uncle.

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 30.-Li Hung
Chang, despite the fact that he attended
a dinner given in his honor Saturday
night by the ex-ministers to China at the
Waldorf and had remained up at least an
hour beyond his usual hour for retiring,
arose this morning at 6:30 o'clock. The
great man breakfasted at 8 o'clock, after
wnich he retired to his sitting-room. At
10 o'clock a delegation of thirty Chinese
merchants, representing tbe Lee Fam in
the-'e parts, called on tbe Embassador to
pay their respects. The delegation, which
was headed by the Ciinese Consul, was
attired in all the splendor of Oriental
dress, and their pietails were carefully
groomed. The members of the delegation
all bowed, almost to tbe ground, as they
entered Li Hung Chang's presence, and
the great man returned the salute. Tbe
audience lasted for more than an bour,
and it must have been a pleasant meet
ing, for the delegation was smiling all
over when they came out of the room.
Tne most interesting part of the pro
gramme was the visit of the Embassador
to the tomb of General Grant on the River
side drive. Li Hung Cbang had a great
admiration for General Grant, who was
one of his heroes. At an early hour in tbe
forenoon a crowd began to gather in tbe
vicinity of the Waldorf anxious to get a
glimpse of tbe famous Chinaman. Acting
Inspector Hariey, with a force of 125 men
stationed around the house, kept tue peo
ple from crowding around the hotel.
There was no cavalry escort to-day, the
mounted policemen doing the honors.
The programme of the Viceroy was a per
sonal one, and this accounts for tbe ab
sence of the Government escort.
The hour set for Li's visit to Grant's
tomb was 3 o'clock. Before that time the
police stopped traffic and nobody was ad
mitted into Twenty-third street. A dense
mass of people lined the sidewalks along
Finn avenue as far as tbe eye could see.
There were bluecoats stationed all along
the route wuicb was covered by the dis
tinguiabed visitor. This was: Fiftlx
avenue to Forty-ninth street, to the Boule
vard, to Riverside drive and the tomb.
Aciing Police Inspector Thompson was in
command of 500 men, stationed around the
tomb and along the drive.
Colonel Fred Grant, accompanied by his
son, Ulysses Grant, and by his brother,
Ulysses G^ant, of San Diego, Ca:., arrived
at the Waldorf at 2:20 o'clock. . Mrs. Grant,
the widow of General Graut, who was
staying at tbe Fifth avenue Hotel, was
driven to Colonel Grant's house. 25 East
Sixty-second street, where Li Hunt; Chang
was to visit her after tbe ceremony a: the
tomb was over.
An immense wreath which the EmbaÂ»
sador was to place on the tomb of the
dead general was first carried downstairs
from the Viceroy's apartments. This
wreath, carefully guarded by a member of
Li's suite, was placed in a cab and taken
to the tomb.
Precisely at 3 o'clock Li Hung Chang,
escorted by General Ru^er and Colonel
Grant, came downstairs and walked
through the corridor of the hotel to the
Thirty-third-street entrance. There a car
riage was waiting and he took nis seat in
it. Colonel Grant, Genecal Ruger and the
official interpreter occupied seats in the
same carriage. In the second carriage
were General Miles, General Horace Por
ter and Henry W. Cannon. Uiysses
Grant, the iÂ»on of Colonel Fred Grant; his
uncle, Ulysses Grant, and Mr. Drew, were
in the tbi.d carriage. Then came tbe Chi
nese Minister and ex-Minister to China
General F. Seward. In the last carriage
were four attendants of the Embassador.
Li Hung Chaug's chair occupied a car
riage all to itself.
Everything was ready in a few minutes
and the start for the tomb was made at
3:10 o'clock, the carriag s driving at a fair
gate up Fifth avenue. U Hung had his

guard from Governors Island. A solitary
policeman stood guard at the gate of the
tomb, in which had been placed earlier
in the day a wreath from Mrs. U. S.
Grant Sr., consisting of white roses and
galaxy leaves tied with a satin bow. Li
Hung C ang and party drove up River
side drive opposite the tomb at 4:15
o'clock. His appearance was a signal for
hearty cheering.
There was a short delay while one
of the Chinese attendants hastened back
to a rear carriage to bring Li Hung
Chang'a sedan chair. When it arrived he
was carried by four policemen from the
road to the tomb. He carried his um
brella in one hand and a gold-mounted
cane in the other.
Oa reaching the top of the flight of
steps Li alighted. The heavy iron door
leading to the tomb wa3 then opened. Li,
after taking in one hand his floral wreath,
entered the crypt and placed it on the iron
casket. Before doing so he made a pro
found bow. At his Bide were Colonel
Fred Grant, his brother U. S. Grant of San
Diego, Cal., and his son, U. S. Grant Jr., as
well as Lo Fung Lv, the Chinese inter
preter. On the steps outside stood Gen
eral Ruger, General Horace Porter,
Colonel J. J. McCook, J. H. Seward and
Captain Mills. Several members of the
Viceroy's suite, including his son, Lord Li,
also stood near the entrance.
Li's wreath was a beautiful affair. It
was about four feet in diameter and con
sisted of bay leaves and white and mauve
orchids tied with yellow velvet. The oc
casion seemed to affect Li deeply. In con
versation with Colonel Grant he referred
to his admiration of the late General's
qualities. One of the leading reasons, he
added, for returning home by America
was to visit his friend's grave. Through
the interpreter he made many inquiries
about the mausoleum, toward vrhicn he
forwarded Hon. John Russell Young a
check for $500.
After remaining standing for twenty
minutes alongside of the casket Li uttered
several words in Chinese and made a pro
found bow. Stepping backward to the
door he repeated the same words to him
self and made a second bow. ' Then he
withdrew. As he seated himself in the
sedan chair the crowd uttered a rousing
cheer. Tnis seemed to please him greatly,
for he gently nodded hiaJiead.
The eutire party then entered carriages
and were driven to the residence of
Colonel Grant in East Sixty-second street.
There a crowd of 3000 people awaited
them. Li declined the use of the sedan
chair, and leaning on the arm of General
Ruger and Colonel Grant he ascended the
flight of carpeted steps. At the d&or he
was met by Ulysses S. Grant, son of the
late General. The other meniDers of the
party followed.
The Viceroy was conducted to the parlor,
where he was received by Mrs. Grant,
widow of the late General. Mrs. Grant
and Li are old friends and the meeting
was affecting. Mre. Grant met his Excel
lency in China in 1879, when accompany
ing General Grant on his trip around the
world.
The Viceroy was presented to all the
invited guests. He spoke feelingly to Mrs.
Grant of the great lost she had sustained
in the death of her husband and said he
would always cherish the General's
memory.
Then the Viceroy presented Mrs. Grant
with several pieces of brocaded silk, a rare
Chinese vase and a number of chests of
tea. He also presented U. S. Grant Jr.
with a valuable jade stone. The Viceroy
seemed to enjoy iu3 visit greatly. Refresh-
ments were served, but Li contented him
, self with taking two enpsof tea and smok
ing a few cigarettes. The visit lasted an
hour. When Li was on the point of leav
ing Mrs. Grant presented him with a large
sized steel engraving of her husband.
Li Hung Chang, accompanied by Colo
nel Grant, reached the Waldorf on his re
turn at 6:45 p. m., and retired for the night
at 8:30 o'clock. He will leave the hotel at
7:30 a. m. to-morrow to board the United
States dispatch boat Dolphin. After in
specting the warships down the bay West
Point will be visited.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Aug. 30.
The city to-day has been quiet, and no re

Bombs were also thrown at the offices of
the Credit Lyonnais and the tobacco regie.
Yesterday the foreign diplomats, after

Yildiz appealing to the Sultan
directly, in the name of the countries they
represented to put a stop to the horrors
which were being enacted, and to which
in some instances members of the various

Interesting.

Presses.]
BERLIN, Geemany, Aug. 30.â 1t is now
announced that tne annual congress of
the German Socialists will be convened at
Sieblichen, near Gotha, ou October 1L It
was originally intended to hold the con
gress in the city of Gotha, but this was
found impossible for the reason lhat the
executive committee of the feocialists were
refused the occupancy of any hall in tnat
city capable of containing the number of
persons who would be present as delegates,
to say nothing of the spectator?, the own
ers declining to allow their halls to be
used for the purpose of Socialist meetings.
The programme of the congress is heavily
charged with resolutions in which a num
ber of questions appear. Foremost of
these is the question of reorganizing the
directing committee and the local com
mittees, wnose working mechanism suf
fered to a great degree under the decrees
issued against Socialists by Herr yon
Koeller during the latter part of that gen
tleman's occupancy of the post of Prussian
Minister of the Interior.
Then there are the reports of Herr
Bebel, the Socialist leader in the Reich
stag, upon the International Socialist Con
gress recently held in London, applying
to the German Socialists the lessons which
the Continental Socialists leained at the
London congress, and there will certainly
be a lively discussion of Herr Bebel's pre
sentation of his views and recommenda
tions. Next the congress will be asked to
pronounce in favor of proportional repre
sentation in the electoral system, it is
only natural that the delegates to the
congress should support the proposal for
proportional representision, which, if the
method should be applied, would have the
effect of sending nineiy-hve Socialists to
the Reichstag instead of forty-three, as at
present. The debat3 on this question will
be purely academic, as there is not the re
motest chance that the system of pro
portional representation will prevail in
Germany. Among the other subjects of
debate by the congress will be Dr. Lat
genau's reports on the proportional repre
sentation system, Frau Clara Kettin's
paper on woman's rights and Herr Aver's
reiort on the question of organization.
The meeting is likely to be an exceed
ingly lively and interesting one. despite the
fact that the anarchists will be kept out of
the congress, for th->re is certain io be a
row over the upheaval which has occurred
within the fold of the Vorwaerts, the lead
ing organ of the German socialists, six
editors of which journal, headed by Dr.
Adolf Braun, published a protest in the
leading column of the Vorwaertson Thurs
day denouncing Herr Liebknecbt's dicta
torial management of the paper. Whether
Liebknecht be present in Berlin or absent
from the city he absolutely controls the
policy of the Vorwaerts without even the
pretense of consulting with his col
leagues.
"If," says the protest of the editors, "the
authority of Herr Liebknecht is alone com
petent to decide all questions we unani
mously resign our connection with the
paner.
The immediate ground of the quarrel,
which has resulted in the withdrawal of
tne principal pditors of the Vorwaerts, was
the action of Herr Liebknecbt in disavow
ing the attack made in the paper upon the
Socialist leader, Herr Quarek of Frank
fort, apropos of his scheme for thp estab
lishment of workingmen's syndicates.
To the general public this disputing over
Socialist jealousies and the open exhibi
tion of insubordination of the minor lead
ers in the Socialist party presents a pitiful
spectacle and is greatly weakenine popu
lar belief in its force as a political factor.
The temporary silence of the German
newspapers in regard to the ministerial
crisis does not imply that the Emperor
has arranged with Prince Hohenlohe that
the latter shall retain the ChanceJlorship,
nor does the announcement of the Reichs
anzeiger, the official gazette, that a bill
for the reform of military judicial pro
cedure is to be considered by the Buncies
rath to avert the resignation of the Chan
cellor or remove the probability of a con
flict between the Kaiser and the Reich
stag.
The fact is that a great deal depends
upon the nature of the measure placed
before the Bundesrath. If the Emperor
assents to the reorm demanded by the
Reichstag making the military tribunals,
independent proceedings and the supreme
military court's final proceedings public,
no constitutional struggle will arise over
this question. But the Emperor certainly
will not assent to such a measure, and
every one knowing the exact situation
still expects that the matter will give rise
to a fig t in the Reichstag of the gravest
character in defense of the constitutional
authority against the court cabals.
If Prince Hohenlohe retires alter seeing
the visit of the Czar to Breslau concluded
hi 3 retirement will be the <<ienal for a gen
eral rising against the Emperor's secret
advisers, his military cabinet, his naval
cabinet and his civil cabinet, which are
now practically ruling the affairs of the
empire.
The imperial court will remain at Pots
dam until Christmas. The arrangement
of the Emperor's programme for the com
ing week has been slightly altered. The
Emperor will leave Potsdam on Tuesday,
going to Dresden to attend the military
maneuvers there. From Dresden bis
Majesty \nll go directly to Breslnn, where
he will receive the Russian Emperor.
Prince Henry of Prussia, the Kaiser's
brother, will also go to Breslau, and after
the gala opera performance in honor of the
Czar will start on Sunday directly for
Kiel, where he will receive the Czar upon
the arrival of the latter there. All busi
ness will be suspended in Breslan on Sep
tember 5, the day of the arrival of ti e
Czar and his reception by the Emneror.
After the military maneuvers the Kaiser
will proceed to Kiel and go on boarl the
imperial yacht Hohenzollern, from the
deck of which he will watch the naval
evolutions.
There are court whispers that the
Empress Frederick has written to the
Kaiser rebuking him for ignoring the visit
to Germany of the Duke nnd Duchess of
Soarta, the latter ti.e Emperor's sister,
who have recently been staying with the
letter's mother, Empress Frederick, at

The Catholic congress, which closed
after a five days' session at Dortmund on
Friday, passed a resolution proposed by
Dr. Porsch, warning German Catholics
against emigrating to America under the
present economic conditions. Among
the other resolutions adopted were those
condemning the practice! of dueling
among officers of the army and navy, and
deploring the fact that no Christian
power has effectively espoused me cause
of the Armenians. Resolutions were also
passed advocating the repeal of the an*i-
Jesuit law and the prohibition of the em
ployment of married women in factories.

Attendance.
SAN JOSE, Caj,., Aug. 29.â This has
been a great day with the San Jose Turner
shooting section. While the rifle range
has been used this was the first big shoot
for prizes, and an invitation was extended
to marksmen all over the State. The con
tests will continue to-morrow, and the fes
tival will end with a ball in the evening.
The Turn Verein has now a membership
of over 200 and the shooting section boasts
of forty marksmen. It was organized in
1893 Dy Captain Klein, starting with a
charter membership of twenty-five. A
year ago the organization purchased a
pretty plat of four acres of ground three
miles south of San Jose. Ornamental
trees were set out and arbors constructed
to beautify the park. To-day the trees are
in foliage and the arbors are Covered with
hop vines. A dancing pavilion, bowling
alley and shooting stand and six targets
(200 yards) are among the other improve
ments. The range is fitted witu all mod
ern appliances and the targets are backed
by a high hill. The entire property and
improvements cost over $6000. A line of
electric-cais connects the park witu San
Jose.
Last night the guests began to arrive,
the first being the San Francisco Red
Men's schuetzen section, all in uniform.
This body was under the direction of Cap
tain John Tildemann, First Lieutenant
Henry Griebe and Second Lieutenant
William Dressier. This morning the first
train from San Francisco brought down
William Ehrenpfort, Dr. L. L. BÂ»bin and
Mrs. Babin, H. fetrecker ot San Joaquin,
Philo Jacoby, O. Schlueter ot Woodland,
Fred Wille, Adolph Strecner, John Ut
schig and others. The guests were met at
the depot by the San Jose Turners and the
San Francisco Red Men, headed by Schu
bert's baud. Alter marching through the
principal street the pleasure-seekers and
marksmen went out to the park. There
the following committees were in charge:
Committee on anangementsâ Hugo Otter
(chairman), L. Webefe Captain Fred Schu
macher, ired Baumgartner, H. Rohr, A. Ourr
len, L. Zeigler, L. Heuning and George Keffel.
Prize committeeâ*. Posky, George Keffcl, F.
Baumgartner and Karl Klein.
Captain Schumacher presided as shoot
ing-master and F. Posky as master of
ceremonies. Tue bowiing contests were
under the direction of Henry Doer. The
refreshments in the pavilion were under
the supervision of Mrs. F. Schumacher,
Mrs. L". Buff, Mra. M. Posky. Mrs. A.
Zeiler, Mrs. G. Otter, Mrs. H. Prugmeier
anil Mr 3. M. Schmitt.
Those who did not care for shooting
went to the pavilion, but few caring to
walk around the grounds on account of
the moisture, lor it rained last night and
this morning. The rain, no doubt. Kept a
number away from the park.
It did not take the riflemen long to get
to work on tt.e targets. , The rules are the
same as govern all. There were four point
and two honorary targets. On the point
targets there were fifteen prizes for the
best centers and fifteen for the most points.
Silver medals will be given to marksmen
making over 50 points and cash prizes for
100, 200 and 260 points.
An extra prize consisting of a beautiful
gold medal, do.mted by the San Jose Mer
cury, will be given to the marksman scor
ing the most points in both days' shooting.
On the honorary target, 25-ring German
standard, tuere are 75 prizes, valued at
$750. These consist of jewelry, silverware
and household goods. Three shots consti
tute a score.
At 10 o'clock the targets ware opened
and the rifles were quickly popping for the
first bullseye on the honorary target. The
honor fell to Jacob Fournie and he won
%1 60. The last bullseye in the forenoon
was contested. William Ehrenpfort and O.
Schleiter pulling together and getting the
red flajr at the same time. It was decided
that they should divide the honor and
prize.
Dr. F. Bangs started out well on the
honorary target, making 22, 23, 24 â 69.
Dr. A. M. Barker followed soon after with
20, 24, 22â66, and Jacob Fffurnie with 21,
17, 23-61.
On the Doint targets the shooting was
fairly good. W hiie there was no wind, the
light was not as good as could be desired.
When the targets were rung down at
noon the Turners and their guasts re
paired to the pavilion, where the ladies
had prepared a fine lunch, to which jus
tice was done. Captain Schumacher in a
neat speech welcomed his guests and bade
tht i enjoy themselves. Captain Tiede
niann of the Red Men, Philo Jacoby, Wil
liam Ehrenpfort and others also spoke
briefly. When the tables were cleared a
Jarge number engaged in dancing, while
the riflemen returned to the range.
There was a lively struggle for the first
builseye after noon, and it fell to the lot
of John Utschig to win the $2 50 prize. A.
Strecker's first ticket on the honorary
target crowded Dr. Bangs', as he made 22,
21, 25â68. J. Utschig quickly went two
better: 24, 24, 22â70. Ou the point target
Philo Jacoby made a peculiar ticket,
which showed even, holding but poor
luck, as he got no red flags. It was: 1, 2,
2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2â13 points. J. Utschig had
better success, for he ran 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2 â
15 points, the highest made up to 3 o'clock.
As the afternoon advanced the condi
tions of light were less favorable to good
shooting, the clouds and sunshine playing
tricKs on the bullseyes and sights. As a
result no very good scores were made.
A. Strecker reached 16 on the point tar
get, while Dr. Bangs, Dr. Barker and Uts-
chig pulled up, close with 15 each. The
last bullseye in the afternoon was made
by A. Strecker.
To-morrow both targets will be kept
open from 10 to 5 o'clock, and it will be
late in the evening before the cash and
honorary prize-winners will be known.
To-ni.p;ht the Turners and their guests
and wives and daughters had a jolly time
in Turner Hail on Third street. L.
Zeigler officiated as master of ceremonies.
Four large tables were spread with re
freshments. W. H. Currling delivered the
address of welcome, speaking for Mayor
Koch, to whom this pleasing office fell,
but who is ill.
Mr. Currling discussed the singine, ath
letic and shooting sections of the Turners
and said that these three were the only
true manly sports, in fact they went to
gether.
Henry Hirsch, assisted by the singing
section, sang a solo entitled "On Guard."
He was recalled repeatedly.
Living pictures were presented by the
Turner athletes, which" showed the fine
physical training they received at the
hands of Professor Ritter.
The Turners look forward to a fine time
to-morrow. A number of marksmen are
expected from San Francisco, and in the
evening the prize distribution will be fol
lowed by a grand ball.

TOLEDO, Ohio, Aug. 30.â Professor E.
D. Cole of Ann Arbor, Mich., an aeronaut,
was drowned in the bay off Presque Isle
this afternoon, and his companion, Josie
Carmo, narrowly escaped a similar fate.
The couple had been here for some days
giving balloon ascensions at a resort on
toe bay shore. They made an ascension
this afternoon, and were to drop with
parachutes. The high wind carried the
balloon off shore, and in a short time Cole
and his companion found themselves
struggling in the water. Miss Carmo's
life preserver held her up until assistance
came, but Cole's got away from him, and
being unable to swim, he quickly sank.
His body was recovered twenty minutes

LOS ANGELES. Cal., Aug. 30.â 1t is
stated that the Republican State Central
Committee has decided to place Colonel
H. Z. Osborne, editor of the Evening Ex
press, on the electoral ticket, in the plaie
made vacant by the resignation of Colonel
C. F. Crocker. It has been argued by the
friends of Osborna that, as the northern
part of the State was represented in the
choice of Irving M. Scott, Southern Cali
fornia should be recognized, too. Mr. Os
borne is prominent in politics in this sec
tion and is popular in the party.
The one topic of discussion to-dny has
been the monster political demonstration
in favor of McKinley at Hazzard's Pavilion
last night. The result of the attempt of a
band of Democrats to disturb tne orators
has been to set taoughtful people against
the chaotic Bryan crowd. Colonel Harri
son Gray Otis, whose able sp?ech at Pasa
dena did much in aid of the cause, said
to-day: "The great meeting has done
much to unite Republicans and to insure
the chances of a victory for McKinley."
In the same strain were the words of
Colonel H. Z. Osborne, Frank Flint and
other prominent men who have studied
the situation. Some who favored free
silver at the outset now begin to see that
open mills and busy factories are what
the people need and that free silver on the
Bryan plan is a delusion and a snare.
John C. Collins, a well-known carpenter,
who has summed up the situation care
fully said to a Call correspondent to
night:
"At the outset there was considerable
hurrah over Bryan in laboring circles, but
I can say beyond all doubt that the tide
has set in the other way in dead earnest.

Equal Suffrage.
REDWOOD CITY, . Cal., Aug. 30.â The
woman suffrage movement io San Mateo
County is daily gathering in its wake new
adherents to the cause. Those who at

enfranchisement of women have, upon
mature consideration of the subject and
the enlightenment received through . the
opinions of prominent individuals
throughout the country, become con
vinced of the absolute necessity of equal
ity of suffrage.
Precinct clubs have been organized in
every precinct in the county and it is ex
pected" that by the first of November every
voter. in the county will have been reached
and a thorough canvass rave been made.

Mexican Rurales Capture

Cutthroats.
ATROCIOUS CRUELTY OF
THE BAND.
One of Its Victims Found Tied
to a Tree in a Lonely
Canyon.
BOUND, GAGGED AKD LEFT TO
PERISH.
Almost Dead From Exhaustion When
Discovered â Stolen Horses Re
turned to Owners.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 30.â Campo,
the sun-burnt little border town, the
headquarters for startling scrimmages be
tween the officers of the law and horse
thievee, smugglers and Mexican despera
does, comes to the front with another
delectable story of villainy vanquished
and stolen horses recovered. The pic
turesque train of events had their begin
ning in Lower California, but more than
one Campo citizen lost horses, so every
body in the town was interested in the
det â 
For months, even rears, the officers on
both sides of the line have had trouble with
horsethieves, who drove their plunder
down onto the desert and into tbe Cocooah
Mountains, below the line, where tney
were free from American officers and
ready to fignt any Mexicans who pursued
them. For a year past it has been known
that a large gang of thieves had its head
quarwrs at a certain park in the Coco
pahs, and the officers even learned tne
names of most of the eang. It was found
that there were twelve men, ten known to
the Campo people and two strangers.
During the past month the thieves have
been especially lively. Eighteen or
twenty horses were stolen from the vicin
ity of Campo alone, and below the line the
Mexican ranchers complained that their
horses seemed to take wing? and fly away.
The thieves became so bold that they
stole hcrses in dayli?ht out of the fields,
driving them down through the pine for
ests of the peninsula and thence to the
Cocopah stronghold.
This high-canded proceeding aroused
the officers on both sides of the line, and
rosses were sent out to overhaul the des
peradoes- The American officers, not
daring to cross the boundary line, could
do iktle beyond patrolling tne border,
while the Mexican rurales penetrated into
the Cocopaiis, searching for the head
quarters of the gang. Meantime the
ranchers tnemselves went on the hunt,
trying to recover their own stock.
On the 15th inst. two Mexican ranchers,
who had missed ten horses, started out
with the"intention of recovering them or
making lead fly in the attempt. They took
rifles and plenty of ammunition, and fol
lowed the trail of the horses toward the
Cocopah range. They saw by the trail
that five or six men had driven the stock
away, so they moved cautiously in the
purs-
In the range they found a little, park
like mesa, with good feed, and there, ap
:ly w::h no guardians or herders,
: >:nd thirty horses and mules, all
hobbled. Not seeing any sign of the
tnieve* the two ranchers went in and be
gan to tin-hobble their own animals. They
had freed eight when a sudden volley was
sent from an ambusn on the hills above
tbe park. The ranchers were not injured
and they made haste to seek shelter. They
could not return tbe fire as tne assailants
were completely hidden.
Hastily* mounting, they courageously
rounded up rueir eight free animals and
drove them before them out of the valley
and back home. A brisk fire was kept
cd by tne ambushed marauders, but they
were too far away to do any damage and
too cowardly to leave their hiding-place.
The ranchers held their rides ready to
Eick eff the first man who showed his
cad.
The two ranchers drove their stock
straight across the gap or desert between
the Cocopati range and the main range to
the west, in order to reach the fiist water.
They got there safely and then turned
northward toward home, taking a trail
that leads through the pine forests of the
Hanson ranch, a Mexican grant of 20,000
aces.
On the way through the pineries they
beard a faint cry at one side of the trail
and saw a man tied to a tree.
One of the ranchers dismounted and re
leased the stranger, who fell to the ground
in a neap from exhaustion and hunger.
They gave him food and a drink from a
canteen, and he soon revived. Ha said he
was Rabavo, a Frenchman, and that he
had been robbed of his horse, saddle and
bridle by a gang of horsethieve? that met
him where he nad been tied. The outlaws
overpowered him and tied him there eariv
tbe previous morning, and he bad been
th?re a day and a half.
The traii is lonesome and unfrequented,
and his rescue was remarkable. Rabavo
said the y>ung Mexicans in the gang
treatea him with the narshest crueltyT
thrusting a gag into his moutn and tying
the cords about his wnst,s so tightly "that
blood flowed. They beat him over the
head w^th their riatas ana threatened to
kill him. Indeed, the old man thought
they had carried out their threat wher they
rode off with his horse and !eft bim tied
to the tree. He manage., to get the srag
out of his month, but the thongs were too
tight to be loosened, and in his st-u^g.es
he became so exhausted that be fa:nted
several times.
The two ranchers gave them an animal
and he rode off toward his home, while
they proceeded to Tecaie on the border,
wnere Senor By ley, the Mexican "Judge
of the plains," was notffied of the out
rase. Tiie Judge left immediately, taking
witn him a posse of six rurales, all picked
men, quick on the trigger ana of tried
courage. Tbey went straight to the Co
copiih stronjrhoid and sarprised two men,
who proved to be the only ones in camp.
Taey were quickly overpowered and tied
to horses.
When the two men were captured they
bad American horses picketed out and
these were aiso taken by the Judge and
his posse. The captors did not look
further, fearing an attack by larger num
bers, but hurried bock toward Tecate. On
the way they stopped at a ranch and
there found tracks of another of the horse
thieves. whose horse had a peculiar hoof
easily recognized by the expert trailers.
They searched tbe premises and found the
bandit in a haystack where he had hastily
hidden when surprised by the approach
of the officers.
Judge Ryley Â»nd his six rnrales decided
to go direct to Ensenada with their pris
oners instead of to Tecate. They there
fee turned and went southwestward,
reaching Ensenada safely and turning
over their prisoners to the authorities,
who promptly placed them behind the
strong bars ofthe Ensenada prison.
One of the borsethives is Rudolfo Gal
legos, a desperate border ruffian who was
discharged from San Quintin two months
ago after servine a term for stealing mules
from old man Dukes of Campo. Another
prisoner is James Dukes, son of the elder
Dukes.
He is a hard citizen, who has trained
with Mexican cutthroats and Lorse
thieves since childhood. He is an expert
shot, and is greatly feared on the border.
The third man is Nacho Sortello, who
with Epifanio Gallegos, a brotber of
Rodolfo, almost murdered inspector
Ralph Conklin two years ago, when he
was bringing them into San Diezo to jail.
It has been learned that the leader of a
gang ot horsethieves is this same Epifano
Gallegos.
He has a congenial crowd of ruffians,
and has chosen an ideal st>ot tor his
strongnold, as the Cocopah Mountains are
inaccessible to ordinary travel, and plenty
of places are afforded where two or three
ambushed men might defy an army.
The Mexican ant orities have instructed
the rurales along the border to make a de
termined effort to break up the gang, and
it is probable the familiar red-shirted
Mexican horsemen, with short rifles and
sharp eves, will yet make Gailegos and his
gang bite the dust.

THE FRESNO TRAGEDY,
Mrs. Rockwell Cannot Survive
the Wound Infl.cted by
Her Husband.
Threats of Lynching Warn the Offi.
cials to Closely Guard the
Woman's Assailant.
FRESNO, Cal.. Aug. 30.â Mr?. W. W.
Rockwell, who was shot by a worthless
husband at their home in the south
eastern part of the city last night, lies at
the County Hospital with a bullet in her
brain and one in her right side. County
Physician Davidson considers it a peculiar
case and is surprised that the woman is
still living. He does no: believe that she
can recover.
Rockwell is at the County Jail, where
he gave himself up as soon as he had shot
his wife. He is morose and silent and re
fuses to make a statement.
Deputy Sheriff Timmins, who arrived at
the scene of the tragedy a few minutes
after it occurred and who is fully ac
quainted with all the facts, stated to a
Call correspondent to-night that he con
sidered it one of the most cowardly and
atrocious m â  "dtrs in the criminal history
of the count?
The victim waa an honest woman. The
husband, on the other hand, is a worthless
character, who in fact has been under the
surveillance of the authorities. Only a
few months ago he attempted to obtain
money under false pretenses, and barely
saved himseii from prosecution by selling
his household furniture to repay the
double collection oi money he had made.
Rockwell did not provide for his wife and
child.
Oe Friday Mrs. Rockwell went to an at
torney to institute proceedings to a
divorce, and this undoubtedly was t* c
prime motive for the husband's" resolution
to kill her. She had ridden uptown with
Charles Erickson, a prominent vineyard
ist of Washington Colony, who was a
stranger to her, but a brother of a neigh
bor, at whose request he consented to take
her to see a physician, and this Rockwell
seized upon as a pretext to visit and
abuse the unfortunate woman.
He struck her three or four times. Then
he drew his pistol and said he would kill
her and tben himself. She ran out of the
house and be followed, shooting as he
ran. She fell in the street and he left her
for dead.
Rockwell ran back through tbe yard of
his house and tben to the County Jail.
He announced to Jailer Elder that he
had killed bis wife, and as he handed his
pistol over to the officer he said, "I emp
tied this into her."
Talk is very strone against the mur
derer, and suggestions are freely made
that he should be lynched. The Sheriff's
office is not ignoring the talk, and Deputy
Timmins was not disposed to say much,
as he did not want to inflame the public
sentiment.
LOS ANGELES MYSTERY.
John Boid, an Inmate of the
Soldiers' Home, Loses
His Son.
Last Saw the Youngster When He
Placed Him in an Orphan
Asylum.
Lew AjfGELK Office of The Cail,)
328 Sou h Broadway, r
Los Axgeles, Cal., Aug. 30. J
John Boid, a blind and decrepit inmate
of the Soldiers' Home at Santa Monica, is
anxious to learn what has become of his
little boy. When the father went to the
home provided by the Government for the
Nation's defenders, the son was placed in
an orphan asylum in this city. From that
institution the youngster was "farmed
ont,'' and the father lost all trace of him,
although repeated efforts have been made
to discover thÂ« lad's whereabouts.
Bailiff Appel of the Police Court knew
Boid in Arizona, and the old soldier has
appealed to the officer to assist him in
rinding the sequestered son.
About three montns ago, when Boid was
admitted to the home, he left bis son, a
boy of about 13 years of age, in ebaiM of
the orphans' home, at the corner of Yale
and Alpine streets. Boid sent a man to
the borne a month, ago with a message and
some money for the boy. The man was
unable to deliver either the message or tbe
money because the boy was no longer
mere.
Boid, however, waa not satisfied with
the information that the boy had been
placed in a good home, but had a friend,
J. Spring, write to the institution to try to
ascertain wnere the child was to be found-
No response was received from the matron.
Mr. Appel caused an investigation to be
made, and while he has not succÂ»*eded in
locating the boy, he has at least caused the
managers of the home to begin a search
for him. *

SACRAMENTO. Cal., Aug. 30.â Judg- j
ing from present indications the State ,
Fair of 1896 will be the most successful i
ever held; at ail events it will certainly
be the most extensive, and the fair direc- ;
tors and their energetic secretary, Edwin ;
Smith, are sparing neither personal ef
forts nor expense to properly prepare for
the flood of applicants for floor apace in \
the pavilion or stalls at the racetrack.
Under the sKillful finzers of an army of
decorators the interior of the huge pa
vilion is rapidly becoming a maze of gor
geousiy tinted bunting.
The center piece is an innovation in
decorative effort. It consists of an im
mense square pendant of delicately tinted I
pink cloth fringed witn silver stars. Sur- i
rounding this is a larger square cf lemon \
yellow, similarly fringed, and again sur- ]
rounded by an immense square, of light i
blue, from which broad bands of va:i-col
ored bunting drape off in every direction i
to meet ana blend with a mass ol flags
and streamers.
On the floor of the huge building are
scores ot workmen busily engaged in
erecting novel structures composed of !
manufactured and agricultural products,
and the management states that every .
available foot of floor space has been
spoken for. Up in the art department
rapid progress is being made in hanging ;
pictures and placing exhibits, and in every
other department work is progressing
rapidly.
One of the most attractive features of
the fair will be the dairy exhibit, for
which a room will be especially fitted. It
will cave an immense giass front so the
operations within may be witnessed from
the outside. An ice machine will be
placed in the room and the temperature
kept at 60 degrees. Fully 1000 pounds of
milk will be used daily iii giving practical
demonstrations of the best method oi con- i
verting milk into better and cheese.
liv busiest member of the tcaie board i
is J. E. Terry, to whose able management
has been entrusted the entire park. Mr.
Terry states that never before has there
been such a demand for stable space as
during the past two wesks. He has been
obliged to employ a host of carpenters in
erecting extra stalls and will be unable to
accommodate ail the applicants within
the grounds. The track bids fair to be
fast, and some of the speediest travelers in
the Bteta are daily working out.

TENTS STRUCK
AT GLEN ELLEN.
League of the Cross Cadets
Depart for Their
Homes.
CAMP O'RYAN DESERTED
Mass Celebrated Under the Trees
Before the White City
Is Leveled.
FATHER YOREE'S DISCOURSE.
Parting Words of Aivice From the
Priest to the Yonnj Saner-
Bearers.
GLEN ELLEN, Cal., Aug. 30.â The ca
dets of the League of the Cross broke
camp with much military ceremony this
afternoon, and then marched away from
Camp ORyan of many pleasant memo
ries. They folded their tents, sounded
"Tie Girl I Left Behind Me" on the
drums an i bade farewell to the good peo
ple who bad made them feel as guests
for a week. Many of tie young gallants
cast shy glances at the fair daughters of
Glen Ellen and the neighboring country
as they tramped to the train with heayy
hearts. L : .ke everything that is good and
sweet in l : fe the pleasures of a week
proved fleeting, and it was bard to leave
behind tbe beautiful hills and dales, the
scented air and genial sunshine. Stili
the boys marched on to bugle and drum
with the crowd from San Francisco, and
made their exit cneering in reply to the
cheers of country foik.
The closing scenes fairly startled the
little dreamy hamlet named Glen Ellen,
for never before were they witnessed here.
The throng that came in on the train
Saturday night overran every house and
cottage in and about town, and people
slept in hammocks in the Mervyn Hotel
grounds, in barn 3, parlors â everywhere in
fact where one could lie down and rest.
Tne camp iiself was packed to the burst
ing point, rows of summer cottages al*o
were packed with cadets. Then crowds
came from Santa Rosa, Petaluma, Sonoma
and "the hiiis," iadies in summery dresses
and men aii in their best for the balL
This waa indeed a splendid event and
seemed to be thoroughly enjoyed by all
| who participated. The large pavilion was
| nicely decorated with boughs of the bay j
i tree and Japanese lanterns.
Captain H. P. Filgate, commander of
the camp, delivered a brief address, thank
ing the people in behalf of the cadets for
their hospitality. In particular he thanked
Dr. Osbdrne of the Home for Feeble
minded for his kindness to the cadets and
A. Harrison, proprietor of the Mervyn |
Motel, for placing the grounds and hotel j
at the disposal of the young soldiers; also
Dr. and Mrs. O'Donnell, who entertained
them in royal fasnion.
Then the bah began, with a grand
march led by Colonel W. C. Mahoney and
Miss Annie Brennan, followed by Floor
Manager Captain J. E. Power and Miss
Lena Bergerin, after whom marched the
chief officers aud their ladies. As the
hour was iate when the train arrived, the
programme of vocal selections, recitation*,
etc., was dispense! with in favor of danc
ing, which was kept up until midnight.
Everybody was up early this morning,
and long before the train from San Fran
cisco arrived little groups gathered round
the depot to meet their friends. An im
mense crowd came then and jostled its
way toward Camp O'Ryan and on to the
pavilion, wcere a military mass was cele
brated. An tltar was erected, with a
background of evergreens and a cross of
flowers, aad upoo it the Rev. James Mc-
Donald celebrated the mass.
The congregation so crowded the spa
cious floor that it waa only with great dif
ficulty that the cadets marched into posi
tion and formed three sides of a hollow
square in front of the altar. Presently
there was a clanking of sabers, a salute,
and the worshipers knew tnat the solemn
sacrifice had commenced. At the conse
cration ttie cadets presented .-abers and,
kneeling, gave the salute of the League
Regiment by reversing sa&er- and salut
ing with the left hand, muffled drums
roiled, and by this signal it was announced
that the most sacred part of the mass was
reacned by the officiating priest. Again
at the last gospel a salute was given. To
toe accompaniment of an organ a choir of
cadets, composed of Lieutenant Kennedy,
Charles Manning, Lieutenant Dave Barry,
John O'Brien, John Keatine, William
Kelly, W. Ryan, Charles dv Fossee, Rob
ert Canning and Harry Bmith, sang ap
propriate hymns, concluding with "Amer
ica."
The Rev. Peter C. Yorke preached a
brief but effective sermon on the gospel of
the day, which is taken from the Sermon
on the Mount. Father Yorke said it was
one of the most beautiful passages in
scripture, beginning witn that truism, "No
man can serve two masters." In camp
the cadets had seen that there mast be but
one master, and that they could not serve
more than one. O.herwise there would be
confusion and lack of discipline.
"Sore people," he "can go
through the world and compromise be
tween God and mammon. Remember
this, there is no fence in religion; the
man who does not serve God is in tne ser
vice ofthe devil. Whpn God told his dis
ciple? of the lilies of the field he did not
mean that they should lead an idle life;
when he spoke of the birds he did not
want them to live like the birds from
hand to moutb. He wished to tell men
they can't have the over-anxious care for
mammon and serve him at the same time.
"What shall we think of those who in
serving mammon are working six days a
week and then on tbe seventh giving to
their body what they should give to God?
You cannot serve God and mammon;
you have to make your choice now. My
dear boys, serving God is not a hard work;
serving God does not mean that you are to
wear long faces, to go through this world
sad and sorrowful. God made the world
and it is a beautiful world to live in. En
joy it, tben. You have been taught in
camp to do your duty. I can appeal to
your experience taat you who did your
duty pleasea everybody and were happy
yourselves.
"You are going to your homes â into the
world, and remember the world is a
greater camp. Let it be said of you:
â¢Tnere is a boy whh does his duty as he
knows it.' "
Father Yorke said he could not let the
opportunity pass without expressing
thanks to the people of the whole valley
for their kindness to the cadets.
Immediately after the sermon the cadets
marched to the parade ground and
gave an exhibition of drilling while on
dress parade, in the presence of a large
number of people. The rest of the after
noon was spent under the trees or in quiet
strolls through the picturesque country
roads. A special train was necessary to
brinz the cadets and their friends back to
town.
Early this mornina: a final inspection of
tents waa made by Dr. A. P. MuiiigaD,-
Colonel Mafaoney and other officers for
the purpose of making awards of four
prizes for the best kept and best ventilated
tents. Company H carried off two prizes.
The "Dandy Five," composed of Corporal
J Whelan, L. Erlnheim, H. Power. H.
O'Connor, W. Ryan and A. Ohlson of

Some Damage Done to Drying fruit and
the Grain Crop*.
SANTA CRUZ, Cai*. Aug. 30.â A heavy
rain feli here last night â so heavy that,
considering the season, it might be called
a storm. There was a sprinkle during the
evening. The night was warm and sultry
and the storm followed about midnight
and continued until nearly daylight. No
definite information from the farming
section is available, but the storm being
general the damage is severe to drying
fruits and the cut grain that had not been
housed. The soldiers at Camp Garfield
had much shelter from the eucalyptus
grove, but even with that the rain beat ia
under the tents, though doing no serious
damage.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 30.â A light rain
began falling about 7 o'clock last evening

spread on trays for drying, but ihese were
not materially injured.

COULD NOT LIVE
WITHOUT HIM,
Belle Meinert Shoots Her
self in Her Lover's
Presence.
THE WOUND NOT FATAL
Drew a Pistol From Her Pocket
and Fired a Ballet Into
Her Breast
THIS IS HER SECOND ATTEMPT
Both Parents Objected lo Their Mar
riage and Joe Cuneo, Her Lover,
Got Tired of Her.
Belle Meinert, a pretty girl about 21 years
of age, attempted to commit suicide last
night in the presence of her lover, Joseph
Cuneo, by shooting herself under the left
breast.
Cuneo is about 20 years of age and lives
with his father, a carpenter, at 2433 How
ard street. He met the girl about eight
months ago and soon afterward gave her
an engagement ring.
Cuneo's parents objected to the girl as
the future wife of their son, and she be
came aware of the fact. Last Tuesday, in
her father's grocery and saloon, on Twen
ty-third and Vermont streets, she at
tempted to shoot Cuneo, declaring tbat
she would kill him and herself, but was
disarmed by Policeman Doherty, who
happened to be passing the store at the
time.
About 10 o'clock last night the girl met
Cuneo. They walked along Howard street
talking about the objections to their mar
riage, and when they were between
Twenty-second and Twenty-third streets
Cuneo told her that they would have to
part.
She gave him her purse and gloves, and
Cuneo asked what was the matter with
her. She replied, "I am going to kill
myself," and pulled a revolver out of her
pocket He jumped back, thinking she
would fire at him, but she fired at her left
breast and fell to the sidewalk.
Policeman John Connolly heard the
shots. He ran toward them and asked
the girl who shot her. She replied: "I
did." Connolly picked up from the ground
a small 22-caliber revolver which had
dropped from her hand, and on searching
her pocket found a 32-caliber revolver and
a number of cartridges.
Connolly rang for the patrol wagon and
sent the girl to the City and County Hos
pital, where Dr. Dudley found that the
bullet had entered tbe left breast and ex
pressed the opinion that the girl would
soon be all right again.
Cuneo was taken to the Seventeenth
street station, but after making his state
ment to Lieutenant Burke, and subse
quently to Captain Gillen, he was dis
charged.
"I never, intended to marry her," said
Cuneo. "I met her about eight months
ago and gave her an engagement-ring to
'jolly' her along. She often told me that
she was fonder of me than she had been
of any other man, and if I did not marry
her she would be a corpse and so would I.
"After her attempt to shoot me last
Tuesday I was afraid when she pulled out
the pistol to-night that she intended to
shoot me first, l told her I intended giv
ing her the 'shake' and I suppose tbat
was what made her shoot herself.
"My parents would not let me marry
her, and I had no intention myself of
doing so. After 1 became acquainted with
her I learned of her past life, and that set
tled me."
The girl, when spoken to at the hospital,
admitted shooting herself. She was
averse to talking, but said that her parents
objected to her marrying Cuneo and she
determined to die rather than live without
him.
The girl lives with her parents at 1312
Nebraska street. It is said she became en
amored of another man four years ago and
has a baby 3 years old. This is supposed
to be what Cuneo learned of her past life.
TO BUILD THE BRIDGE,
The Contract Let by the Park
Commissionersâ lt Will Be
of Granite.
Animals That Are Now is the Zoo.
Crowds at the Ocean Beach.
Markebnrg's Ascension.
The shower yesterday morning laid the
dust in Golden Gate Park, and in the after
noon the balmy atmosphere brought a
great crowd to the big pleasure-grounds.
Superintendent McLaren has returned
from his vacation to Lake Tahoe, which
he declares is undoubtedly the most beau
tiful sheet of water in the United States.
While roaming through tbe mountains
that surround the lake he secured a large
collection of cones of the different pines
growing there and will plant seeds is one
of the arboreta in the park.
The Commissioners have let to Alex
ander McLenon, for $16,000, the contract
for building the great bridge across the
main drive near the museum. It will be
of Rocklin granite, after the plan which
â was published in The Call on the 6th of
last February. The parapets will be put
up, but much of the ornamentation that
â was introduced by the architects in the
original design will" for the time being be
omitted. There will be a path for pedes
trians on the north aide of the bridge, the
drive for vehicles in the centre and a
bicycle track on the south side.
Theswalk from the tunnel on the eastern
side of tbe grand court to the broad steps
opposite the museum has been put in
order, and many of those who went to the
aviary took that route to the Egyptian
building, enjoying for the first time a trip
through the new tunnel. The work of
putting the facings on the new north tun
nel is progressing, and it will not bÂ« long
before the people will have an opportunity
of passing under the main drive to reach
the Fulton-street entrance.
The family of animals in the zoo is
quite numerous at this time. There are
â within the several enclosures eight buffa
loes, fourteen elt, one moose, thirty deer,
including two spotted fawns from the
South Sea Islands, one mountain sheep,
one ostrich, 20u0 birds in the aviary, about
hall a hundred squirrels in the happy
family cage and a number of swans and
ducks on Stow Lake.
Work on the annex to the museum is
being pushed forward with a limited force
and it is expected that within two weeks
the work of arranging some of the displays
Will be commenced.
John L. Bardwell, an old pioneer and
collector of curios, who has already de
voted very many interesting and historic
articles to the museum, is a regular Sun
day visitor to the place. In conversation
yesterday, in answer to a question as to
his motive for making so many donations,
he said :
â¢Til tell you why I do this; I believe
that it is a means of educating our rising
generation ; it gives the young people an
opportunity to become acquainted with
many objects that they may have read
about, and if they have not read about
them they will, after seeing the different
objects, go to the books and read and
learn. I have been asked why I did not
give the aggregate of what I have con
tributed to a college, and my reply has
been that if I did that it would educate a
few, but that what I have done will edu
cate the masses."
There was a goodly number of people in
the vicinity of the Cliff House during the
afternoon.
The attendance at the Haight-street
grounds was unusually large, the princi
pal attraction being a balloon ascension by
Kmil Markeburg. In spite of many dis
couraging mishaps he has met with of late
he made an ascent, and it was a perfect
one. His balloon rose high and in a short
time was lost to view in tbe clouds, but
before he passed out of sight he released
from a cage a number of pigeons belong
ing to a gentleman in Alameda, and the
birds as soon as they found their bearings
took their flight eastward. Markeburg
made a good parachute drop, but unfortu
nately for him in nearing the ground he
struck on the peaked roof of a house and
is so doing badly injured his left foot. He
was taken back to the grounds, where his
injury was temporarily dressed, after
which he was conveyed to his home.
AndÂ«r*on in JAne.

take the prairie route around the submerged
area.
RAWLINB, Wyo., Aug. 30.â There is a wind
trom the west that is 0 X for speed, but rains
have made the road pretty tough. Heavy
clouds are gathering. Erswill fears a cloud
burst.
RAWLINS, Wyo., Aug. 30.â Charles JEnwill,
manager of the Cheyenne division and holder
of the world's one-mile straieht-away record
with standing start, is here with some of his
crackerjack couriers.
RAWLINB, Wyo., Aug. 80.â Charles Erswill
says he and his boys are going to do them
selves proud.
RAWLINS, Wyo., Aug. 30.-11:50 A. m.â The
packet is humming this way over the moun
tains.
WYOMING. Wyo., Aug. 30.â Big Bill Rishel
of Salt Lake has left us. His division ended at
Rock Springs. He rode the last relay from
Green Mountain before dawn, with the Ogden
crape still tied 10 his wheel.
RAWLINS, Aug. 30â1:35 p. M.â Afterjstriking
the trail at Fort Steele relay won't be heard
from till It reaches Laramie, eighty -vine miles
away. No telegraph stations. Rough riding
among the foothills at Elk Mountain,
RAWLINS, Aug. 30. -The only woman courier
in the Examiner-Journal Yellow Fellow ride
will take the hardest relay in Charlie Erswill's
division. She is Mrs. Rhiuehart of Denver, the
crack road rider, with a record of tea centuries
in six days. She will ride nine miles up the
steepest part of Mount Sherman.
RAWLINS, Aug. 30â4:25 p. m.â Raining here
and all along the road to Cheyenne; very un
usual at this season through this section; bad
roads hold relay back.
Tbe couriers are now ascending the
western slope of the main range of the
Rocky mountains. The little mountain
streams which they cross flow into Green
River, a tributary of the Colorado River,
and ultimately reach the Pacific Ocean at
the Gulf of California. When Sherman is
reached tbe waters flow to the PJatte and
through the Missouri and Mississippi riv
ers to the Atlantic Ocean at the Gulf of
Mexico.
According to the schedule the riders are
due at Sherman at 8:20 this (Monday)
morning, and due at Cheyenne at 10:52
a. m. to-day. At Rawlins they were six
hours and eight minutes latÂ«, with a
stormy night of travel ahead. Tbe wheel
ing must necessarily be slow. The cour
iers must keep the sense of hearing alert to
avoid rushing torrents when lightning
flashes do not reveal to the sight the scenes
of peril. If the cloudbursts precipitate
vast torrents of water Sherman may not
be reached until late this afternoon.
Once over tbe Rockies the relay riders
will have a down-hill run of 600 miles to
the Missouri Hirer and much lost time
may be regained.
MRS. COOPER'S BIBLE CLASS.
The Discussion Wm on Human Sorrow
and Tears.
Many took part in Mrs. Cooper's Bible
class yesterday in the discussion of the
causes which led to the defeat and death
of David's favorite son, Absalom. Many
visitors from Eastern cities were present.
"This is a lesson of human sorrow and
tears," said the teacher. "David received
a heart wound from which he never fully
recovered. David's unspeakable agony
tells us that wrong doing brings the fruit
of pain. David remembered his crime
against Uriah. He knew, too, that he had
not been faithful to bis wayward son, Ab
salom. But David still loved his son.
And here we come to the divine revelation
of the Heavenly Father. Our sins do not
change the fact of our relationship; we
are still God's children, however wayward
and prodigal we may be. But there is
strength and severity, if need be, in true
love. True fatherhood lays a firm hand
on the headstrong boy and says : 'Stop,
my boy, and think. This must not be.
You are going to destruction. This shall
not be.' Then, sometimes, the grieved
and loving father uses a little physical
persuasion. I believe God would be ten
der to us all the time if he could be, if we
would obey his holy laws in us."
He Pulled His Pistol.
G. Kentra and Nicholas Kagelovich, both of
whom are engaged in the fruit business, had
an altercation at Laguna and Grove streets
last sight over some business transactions.
Kentra, who carried a load ot liquor and an
ugly looking revolver, undertook to Impress
the force of his argument upon his opponent
by drawing his plstoh which he was about to
use, when Sergeant Blanx hove in sight and
tooK the pair to the Central station, where
they were charged with disturbing the peace.
Kentra had an additional charge of carrying a
concealed weaoon placed against his name,
while Ragelovich put up bail and went his
way rejoicing.
NEEDED TWO MORE VOTES
Dr. Bowen Almost Elected Pas
tor of the New Jerusalem
Church.
The Congregation Decides to Retain
Him in Its Pulpit for the
Time Being.
The pastorate of the First New Jerusa
lem Church is Btill vacant, though the
pulpit is for the present ably filled by tbe
eloquent and popular Dr. Bowen. A meet
ing of the church members was held yes
terday for the purpose of putting an end
to this temporary arrangement by the
election of Dr. Bowen to the pastorate,
but owing to the absence of a small num
ber of persons the object of the meeting
was not realized.
Sixty-four voting members of the church
society were present, besides about 200
regular attendants at tbe church services.
Judge Provine presided, and in a brief
address stated the object for which the
meeting had been called and asked the
members to endeavor to come to some
definite conclusion as to a regular supply
ing of the pulpit.
There has been talk of some little fric
tion among the members and the result of
the meeting would seem, in some degree,
to confirm the rumor, aÂ» the two-thirds
vote necessary for Dr. Bowen's election
could not be attained. A number of
the reverend gentleman's friends in the
congregation are absent from the City.
Haa they been in town his election would
have been a certainty, since he lacked
only two votes.
It appearing impossible to elect Dr.
Bowen as pastor, it was decided at all
events to retain him temporarily, and the
following resolution was adopted:
Whkeeas, The failure of this meeting to
elect a minister may prove Instrumental in
temporarily closing the church, a result that,
in the estimation ot many members, would be
extremely detrimental to tbe best interests of
the cause of the new church and of this soci
ety in particular; and whereas, there has al
ready been noted an increased attendance and
renewed interest under the earnest and able
ministry of our beloved brother, the Rev. D.
V. Bowen, who, by reason of our invitation,
baa supplied the pulpit of this church during
the few weeks tbat he has beeu sojourning
among us, therefore be It
Resolved, That the board of trustees of this
society be and are hereby authorized and re
auested to continue the present arrangements
with Mr. Bowen, or make any other agreement
that may prove acceptable and satisfactory to
the aforesaid trustees and to Mr. Bowen, to the
end that he may continue to occupy the pulpit
of this church to administer to our spiritual
wauts, until such time as his permanent suc
cessor shall have been duly elected in accord
ance with ihe terms of the constitution of this
society.
Dr. Bowen seems satisfied with the
action of the meeting and will bring his
family to reside with him in this City
during his connection with the church.

IMPERIALS BRACED UP,
New Talent Has Materially Im
proved the Local Base
ball Team.
They Played an Errorless Game and
Easily Vanquished the Oak
land Men.
The reconstructed, reformed, rejuve
nated Imperials were too strong for the
Oakland ball-players yesterday, and in the
latter part of the game walked away from
their opponents.
The colts played an errorless game,
despite the fact that Wilds is credited
with a misplay. The only error made
was one ot judgment, and it should have
been credited to Pitoher McCarthy, who
tried to catch Feenay at first in the last
Inning, after having given him a base on
balls. The Oaklands too fielded well,
being charged with but three mistakes,
not one of which proved costly.
The Imperials were first at bat, and
John McCarthy, the initial batter, was hit
by a pitched ball. He went to first base
and was advanced to third on Nealon's
single. Nealon went to second on Wilds'
out at first. Tillson landed a safe hit
back of second baee and both McCarthy
and Nealon scored. Nealon failed to touch
third base, however, and was declared out
because of his oversight. Muller retired
the side on a fly to Agnew.
Oakland tied the score in the third in
ning. Shea got a base on balls, stole sec-
ond, went to third on Donovan's out and
scored on Walton's fly to left. -
In the fifth, singles by Crowley and Joe
McCarthy,' a base on balls and Nealon's
force hit scored two runs for j the Impe
rials, while â ; in the i sixth the Oaklands
earned a tally on a double by Walters and
Feeney's i single. The . run-getting of . the
visitors' ended right there, and the Impe
rials failed to score again until the eighth.
In the last inning but one, John McCar
thy made the star play of the game. Ag
new was first at bat, and he lifted one of
those exasperating low flies that are too
high for the infield and too short for the
outfield. It looked dollars to doughnuts
that the ball would failsafe, but by a great
exhibition of sprinting McCarthy got up
in time to get the ball. '
He captured *it not two feet ; from the
ground C and was roundly applauded. ; In
the : ninth inning Walters made a catch
almost as brilliant as 7 McCarthy's and
thereby robbed Warde of a hit.
In the eighth inning the Imperials add
ed two i runs to their score. Nealon led
off with a double and Wilds got a base on
balls. Â£; Mnllor landed , a pretty single to
center and both Nealon and Wilds scored.
The â¢â  ball ' was 5 thrown wild Yin trying to
catch the Imperial â  first ; baseman >at the
plate and Muller tried to score on the play
and was caught at the' rubber. -
- Three more tallies wert corraled by the
Imperials in the final inning on two sin
gles, two bases on balls and a triple.

HIS LEG AMPUTATED.
Accident to Paul Mukininn, a Boy, on
the Electric Road.
Paul Makinaon, the seven-year-old son
of George Makinson, Ninth avenue and L
streets, had his left leg amputated below
tbe knee at the Receiving Hospital yester
day by Dr. Bunncll, assisted by Dr.
Maher.
The boy left home about 11 o'clock yes
terday morning to attend Mrs. Cooper's
Sunday-school on Sixth avenue. On his
way he jumped on an Ellis-street electric
car which had just left the park, and when
the car reached Seventh avenue and I
street he jumped off and fell, his left leg
being thrown across the rail. The rear
wiieel of the car passed over it, crushing it
into pulp. The car proceeded on its way
to the City, neither the motorman nor
conductor being aware of the accident.
The ambulance was summoned and the
boy was taken to the hospital, where his
leg was amputated.
HARVEST HOME.
The Church of thÂ» Advent the ; Scene
of a Large Gathering Last
Night.
Some three or four hundred children, as
well .as a ; large â  congregation of adults,'
crowded the Episcopal Church of .the Ad
vent to the doors last night on the occasion
of the [\ Harvest J Home festival. A ; pro
gramme ; of special orchestral and vocal
music was finely rendered during the
evening, the â¢ former including ; Gounod's
magnificent "Aye Maria" : and ; Raff's
scarcely less beautiful together
with a violin " solo by F. C. Piise. George
King, the young organist 'of the church,
played with conspicuous ability.^gggf^Spi^
The members of the orchestra were as
follows: Pianist, Miss Kate Madden; first
violins, F. 0. Piise and J. Harding; second
violins, Louis : Sorian and : Emile Coret;
flute, 8. Disbeoker; cornetist, W. C. Mur
ray; clarione tist, F. Lane.
: The chancel : and approaches were ex
quisitely decorated with votive offerings
from the field and orchard, the handsome
altar in particular >. forming ; a most attrac
tive center-piece. The effect of such fea
tures as the foregoing was further intensi
fied by the ' picturesque accessories of the
Episcopalian ritual. Rarely, in fact, has
the handsome interior of the Church of
the Advent been seen to greater advantage.
The rector,? Rev.; J. A. Emery, was as-;
sisted in the conduct ' of the " service by.
Revs. 'H. B. i Monges ' and Howitt, whila
the children of the : Sunday-shool were
under the supervision of Superintendent
J. Allaire. - .; . Â»~\r-^:x â  v "-â / â - \
The children having been put through
the catechism, the rector briefly ad
dressed the congregation. ;He expressed
a hope that the present might merely
prove one of - many similar gatherings,
and intimated that the collection would
be set aside for the benefit of the Sunday
school. ' . ." i
He could not recollect a single previous
instance on which ho cad ; ever made a
begging appeal from the chancel, but to
night he would ask them to do something
for the children, so that when Christmas
came round once more it would â¢<â â  be i pos
sible to give them as happy a festival and
as many remembrances as has been done
in the time gone by.
TO LEAD STANFORD MEN
Football Captain Fickert Worked
All Summer Near
Tehachapi.
Comes Back Hopeful and Determined
and Says the Team Must Play
a Fast Game.
Charles M. Fickert, captain of the Stan
ford football team, arrived here yesterday
from the mountains near Tehachapi Pass,
where he has spent the last three months
in different kinds of rough work, that he
might be well prepared to go ucon the
gridiron field and lead his men through a
vigorous season. His father owns some
land in that part of the country, a little
farm of about 13,000 acres, devoted to the
raising of grain and cattle, and there the
son, who is a youth about six feet two
inches in height and strongly built, has
been taking a turn at everything that
would produce muscle.
He is very hopeful over the prospects at
Palo Alto, whither he will go to-day to
look at the incoming freshmen.
"This year," said he, the Stanford team
must play a faster game. That is one of
the things I shall work for. Then I want
to take Soper in hand at once and teach
him to tackle. He is a good punter, but
that is not the only requisite for a full
back. That position will be hardest to
fill, particularly as Berkeley has such a
fine kicker in Captain Eansome. Ho is
the whole team. There is a big, active
fellow named Freeman, a freshman last
year, tliat I count on some for fullback.
He is the tennis champion and played on
the baseball team. lie is cool and strong.
Then there is Young, first base in the ball
team. He weighs 205 pounds and might
make a good guard. We are pretty well
off, though, in the line. Fisher and Dale
or Thomas are good men for halfs. Wnat
we will most need are a fullback and a
quarter. I have an idea now that we
couldn't do better than put Jeffs and
Cotton on tbe ends.
"I hear there is a great deal of fresh
man material of some experience, espe
cially players from the Northwest, where
they say we are to get four or five men.
But I do not count much on freshmen for
the varsity. In the last four years only
two freshmen have made the Stanford
teamâ McMillan of '97 and Cotton o! '98.
Tbe prospects are good for a much better
freshman eleven than in previous years,
and that means something to the varsity
next year or the year after. The captain
of the Denver Hieh School team is already
at Palo Alto and will enter as a freshman,
and there are others from the East. I
beard the other day tbat Whitehouse is
coming back to Stanford. He played
tackle in '93 and afterward left college,
played with the Reliance, and is now in
the East, where he has just given up his
position."
A Determined Suicide.
Auguste Girard, a native of France, aged 52
years, whose residence is given in the direc
tory as 1117 Broadway, shot himself through
the right temple yesterday at 2 o'clock at 817
Larkiu street.
From what could be learned from his mother
and A. Laduc at the place where the suicide
took place, the deceased and Laduc had re
cently bought the saloon, in the rear room of
which Gimrd killed himself a short time
a nee, and as tbe business was not very flourish
ing the deceased became despondent, and on
several occasions during tbe past few days he
threatened to end his existence.

OF THE CHURCH,
Those Who Received the
Sacrament of Con
firmation
FROM THE ARCHBISHOP.
Solemn and Impressive Cere
mony at St. Agnes
Church.
A SERMON TO PARENTS.
When Confirmed the Boys Unhesi
tatingly Joined the League of
the Cross.
Yesterday, for the first time in its his
tory, Bt. Agnes Church, on Masonic ave
nue, was visited by Archbishop Riordan.
Some fifty intelligent children received
the sacrament of confirmation from his
hands.
"I am glad to meet you all and to greet
you," said the Archbishop to the large
congregation assembled,, "under such au
spicious circumstances. The confirmation
of the children, which you have come to
witness, is a momentous event in your
lives and theirs. It marks a period in
their lives when they must be guided in
their daily conduct chiefly Dy their own
reason, and can rely no longer solely upon
the counsel of their parents and teachers.
"The children are now entering upon the
most dangerous years of their Jives, for
they will soon be leaving home, forming
new associations and encountering many
new temptations. The practice of virtue
is not always easy. We are often com
pelled to mix with good and evil company,
and our children when leaving the home
of their parents need to be strengthened
with virtue. It is for this reason that the
holy churoh administers the sacrament of
confirmation.
"The Jear children know what is right,
and God, coming in the sacrament, will
give them the moral strength and courage
to do what is right. It is in tbe home that
the spiritual and intellectual training of
children should ever be continued. As a
rule boys are like their fathers and girls
generally take their characters from their
mothers. If the parents are sober, indus
trious, God-fearing Christians so will the
children be.
"Next to the home the best source of
instruction is the church, and I urge upon
your attention the necessity of maintain
ing iv ail D&rishes well-organized Sunday
schools, taught by earnest and intelligent
teachers. If we don't look after the morai
welfare of our little ones bow can we ex
pect them to become good Catholics when
they have arrived at years ot maturity and
taken our places? In this skeptical age it
is no easy task to bring up our children in
the way they should go. We Catbolics
cannot be hail-fellow-well-met with every
body, for there are sacred obligations, line
the ten commandments, resting upon us
which we dare not disregard. Conse
quently let us take heed in time and by
properly training our children, provide

LANE TO THE "PEOPLE"
The Millionaire Miner Asks
Small Campaign Con
tributions,
The Silverit-s' Address With an
Apology for Existenc?, but Noth
ing About Lane's L g.
The silverite bosses have issued an ad
dress to the "People of California," sis ned
principally by Charles D. Lane, t c mil
lionaire miner, incipient politician and
would-be Senator, requesting popular con
tributions to the silver campaign fund.
The authors of the address seized the
opportunity they created and presented in
the missive "reasons for the existence" of
the Silver party in this State. The apology
is somewhat interesting in its way.
Charles D. Lane, candidate for the Sen
ate and tne financial godsend to the Silver
and Democratic parties, siirns a letter pro
mulgated by George W. Baker, the South
ern Pacific attorney, Frank J. Moffitt and
others, which says that the organization
"has no private ambitions to further."
These lolks are out l# .or the plain people"
and "seek only ihe consciousness of a duty
honestly performed."
This committee revels El the bignest and
finest State headquaiters any party or
ganization has ever enj >yed in this State.
The drayloads of the St. Louis speech of
Millionaire Francis G. Rowlands, which i
are sucked up in the headquarters, will j
be distributed free among the small sub
scribers to the campaign fund, and they
will thus be kept in "touch" with the
organization.
The issuance of the address has already
caused many wondering inquiries as to
the state of Mr. Lane's leg, the advent of
which into California politics was the
caus^ of so much joyous bailing, and the
elasticity of winch has been regarded vith
so much confidence.
The address in fuil is as follows:
Headquarteks ]
California Silver Â« ampaign Committkk, I
Baldwin Hotel.
San Francisco, Cal., Autr. 27, 1896. J
To the People of Ca ?/oriiÂ»o; In entering upon
a campaign oi education and earnest en
deavor, the California Silver Campaign Com
mittee deems it fitting that some statement aa
to the reasons for its existence, its hopes and
purposes, be made to those whose support it in
tends to ask, whose assistance it will try to
secure.
This is a campaign of the people against the
corporations, of the masses against the classes,
of tne producer against the powers which have
baudtid together to squeeze from him the ulti
mate farthing of his production. In the light
of such a campaign, party lines grow dim or
are entirely obliterated, and honesty of pur
pose becomes the one test for membership in
the on-marching army of financial reform.
Those who speculate in the money of the
people, careless as to the misery caused by
their speculation, are arranging a. campaign
of bribery and intimidation. They will stop
at nothing to continue class domination.
They are already at work.
Their machinations must be counteracted,
their schemes defeated, their dart doings
brought into the light. Their sophistries
must be met by argument, their intimidations
neutralized, their briberies exposed. The
great financial problem must be elucidated
and the benefits of the proposed legislation in
favor of the free coinage of silver at a ratio of
16 to 1 put so plainly before the people that
none need err therein.
It is to do these things that the California
Silver Campaign Committee is arranging to
bend its energies. It will combat error, ex
pose fraud and assist the truth. It has no pri
vate ambitions to further, no private enemies
to punish, no ends to subserve, except such as
make for the public good. It is for these rea
sons that the commit lee feels in a position to
invite the co-operation, support and active
assistance of all opponents of the gold power,
all true friends of the silver cause.
Some time afier tne close ot the National
conventions a number of citizens who uad
been active in the effort to have the silver
i issue injected into the campaign, and whose
unwavering opposition to a single gold stan
dard cannot be questioned, invited a confer
ence of representatives of all parties in order
to discuss the best methods of waging the peo
ple's war. Out of that conference grew this
campaign committeeâ a committee entirely
non-partisan, with but one end and aim â a
triumph of silver and the plain people, oi the
masses over such corporations as enter poli
tics to debauch them, of right over wrong.
Once this triumph is accomp.ished, this com
mittee will go out of existence, making no re-
I quests for ireferment, asking no favors, ex
! peering no reward beyond the consciousness of
! a duty honestly performed.
There is a natural reluctance, even in times
lof greatest stress, to depart entirely from
1 party i filiations, to jump atone bound the
; party lences. So tnis committee hopes to be
come the rallying point for all friends oi sil
ver, tor all who desire the restoration of the
| "wiiite metai" to its natural and proper posi
: tion in the finances of the country, for all who
wish for a betterment of present financial and
commercial conditions. It asks no man to
leave his party to go into another. It hopes to
band together Republicans, Poj ulists and
Democrats under the banner of honesty and to
lead them with the battle cry of "True money
for true men."
The committee feels that the great mass of
the people of California is opposed lothe exac
tions of certain great corporations which have
led and are bull leading the movement for
clbss legislation to the detriment ol :he pro
! ducing toilers. Inasmuch as these corporations
I are opposing the silver cause, just as they
j have fought all measures intended to lighten
j the burdens ot the people, this committee will
j oppose them and use its influence to check
| their rapacity and defeat their evil intentions.
i We are upon like grounds uncompromisingly
j opposed to any and all schemes for the refund
ing of the Pacific Railroad indebtedness to the
United States as unwarranted by tdedicates
I of justice and fair dealing, and an attempt to
secure special privileges for corporate power
contrary to the spirit of a republican form of
government and subversive of the best inter
ests of the people of the State of California.
On the other hand, we hope to be instru
mental in encouraging legitimate industry, in
I promoting business, in chicking the attempts
| ot the gold shouters to produce a panic, and to
give all lines of honest endeavor a surer basis
in more profitable returns. We feel that the
free coinage of silver will directly benefit the
I producer, tne laborer, the farmer, the manu
! facturer, the ertisan, and that their interests
i are superior to those of the stock-jobber, the
1 speculator and the exacting cor| orations
! which hope to grow richer by reducing the
price of labor and interfering with the free
expression of the people's will.
Wiih this brief declaration of its intentions,
the committee feels that it will be free to ask
tiie necessary financial aid from the friends of
silver in all parties. The funds collected will
j be expended with a careful eye to see that
! each dollar achieves a result in furthering
silver's cause. The best literature will be ient
out, clubs formed and speakers commissioned;
All subscribers to the lund and ah those who
! assist in the work of organization and the
j spread of tbe people's doctrines will be re
garded as the direct representatives of the
committeeâ its sub-comnntteemen in the dit
iereni districts. Each will be kept In direct
touch and communication, and in this way it
is expected thai an efficient organization will
be maintained without the expense attendant
upon the maintenance of party machinery,
and the stirring work of a campaign so con
] ducted will result in overwhelming success.
We hope to assist in removing the "crown of
thorns from the brow of labor," to make honest
work worth honest dollars and to further the
election of William Jennings Bryan to the
Presidency of the United States.

TWO KINDS OF
CONFESSIONALS
Father Nugent Eloquently
Defends the Tribunal
of Penance.
SCRIPTURAL AUTHORITY
The Speaker Quotes From the
Apostles to - Show Its
Divine Origin.
HOW SINS ABE FORGIVE*^
Confessional Only One of Six Require*
ments for the Remission of
Transgressions.
Rev. L. J. Nugent of Dcs Momes lec
tured at Su Brendan's Church last even
ing upon "The Last Confessional." Father
Nugent is an accomplished speaker, and
throughout tbe course of a two hours' ad
dress the interest of his auditors never
faltered.
"It is perhaps not known to the people
of this congregation," be said, "that there
are two kinds of confessions. One of these
was instituted by Christ and is in the na
ture of a sacrament. The other was insti
tuted about 300 years ago and is in the na
ture of a campaign document.
"The institution of confession is one of
the most remarkable in the world. I
know of nothing which has been written
about so much by people who know abso
lutely nothing about it. The confession
in the nature of a sacrament is known to
the Catholic church. That in the nature
of a campaign document is known to the
outside world.
"Among those who have succeeded
moderately well in following the law of
God many will tell you that they owe
their salvation largely to the institution
of the tribunal of penance. The confes
sion in the nature of a campaign docu
ment has also done some good good. It
has kept many an apostate priest and
escaped nun irom starving to death.
"The tribunal of penance is a wonderful
institution. It is the last fortification ot
the new convert, and it is the first one
yielded up by the backslider. Priests
know well when a man is beginning to get
morally rotten within by ttie distance he
puts between himself and the confessional.
It is a pity, a ereat pity, that an institu
tion so essentially connected with the vi
tality of the church is so little known by
those outside of it.
"Tbe campaign tribunal of penance was
intended to show the direct opposite of
what the church teaches. The outside
world sees nothing but the negative. You
and I in our early childhood have been
jeered at on account of the confessional.
People say it is wrong Jor any Catholic to
hofd office because cc has given his con
science to the Pope of Rome and he has it
on record. Ihey have taken that idea
solely from the negative, irom the cam
paign document.
"No priest in the State of California
ever taught a child that his sins w. re for
given by confession or through confession.
We do teach them that their sins are re
mitted by the sacrament of penance.
Confession is only one of the six require
ments necessary t.o the sacrament of pen
ance. Three of these are ou the part of
the penitent.
'On tne part of the penitent he must
have truly confessed his sins as near as he
can remember them, he must be sincerely
sorry and rei-oived to amend his ways and
he must make restitution. On the part of
the church there must be origination, jur
isdiction and absolution. Tuounh tbe
priest may be ordained, may have juris
diction from the Bishop and may hold up
his hands and give absolution there can
certainly be no forgiveness unless there is
sorrow. The average non-Catholic doesn't
believe a Catholic is ever sorry for his
sins. He just has his sins forgiven as he
pays his taxes, and takes his receipt and
waits until they accumulate again.
"If 1 were to make that explanation to
a non-Catholic he would say, 'That's
plausible enough, but I don't* see what
right one man has to receive confessions
from anothei man.' lam going to give
the best authority in the worldâ the au
thority o! Jesus Christ. We take up St.
Mark, xviii:lB, and we read: 'Whose sins
you shall forgive they are lorgiven; whose
sins you have retained they iiave retained
them.' The same words occur in St.
John. The church retains those texts as
a charier for this institution.
"There is something peculiar about
these texts. After the world had been
reading these texis tor over fifteen cen
turies, about 300 or 400 years ago a lot of
people woke up and declared tuat we had
been reading them wrongly. If those
words don't mean that, in the name of ihe
English language what do they mean?
There is not a word that a child need ask
the meaning of. It has been beiore the
people for nineteen centuries, Dut people
who say the words of St. Mark mean just
what the say are called Romanists and are
laughed at."
The speaKer then drew upon the history
of me cnurch toreutethe statement that
the confessional was not known prior to
the twelfth century. He quoted extracts
from eminent doctors of the church in re
gard to this institution as early as the first
century. In conclusion he depicted the
practical benefits of the confessional, and
showed how sin-burdened souls were re
lieved at the tribunal ot penance.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
A Number of Exciting and Closely Con-
tested Games Played Yes
terday.
A number of exciting games were
played in the handball courts yesterday.
At tbe San Francisco Court great interest
was taken in a game in which four juve
niles participated. W. Jacobs and R. Mur
phy playing against M. Edwards and J.
Collins. The boys played well, and after
each team had won two games the final
was postponed till next Sunday. The
event of the day was a rattling four-hand
game, T. F. Bonnet and Joe Lawless play
ing against P. T. Donnelly, the amateur
champion, and George Hutcbinson, and
defeating them by two to one.
Several new players made their appear
ance in the Union court and showed that
they could han le the ball almost as well
as the old timers. The chief attraction
was a came between the two crack teams,
J. J. Feeney and Terry McMunus ami R.
Leninan and James Nelson. They played
with their usual dash, and, alter each
team had won two games, it was decided,
owing to darkness setting in, to postpone
the final till next Sunday.
At the Eureka court H. McGrain, One
of the Mission champions, and M. Norton
played a great gÂ»me against J. J. White
and Thomas McLaughlin and defeated
them. Charles Daley, the other cliara
pion, was unable to play from indispo
sition and Norton took his place. Mc-
Grath and Daley say they are content to
be Mission champions and have no desire
to aspire to th- coast championship.

Charles Cavill, tbe Australian Cham
pion, Shows ihe People How He
Can Go Through the Water.
.There was great sport in theSutro Baths
yesterday for the lovers of swimming, and
there were exciting and well-contested
amateur races, one being for the 100-yard
amateur championship of America. These
were conducted under the auspices of the
California Swimming Club, with George
Moss, William Kennedy of the Olympic
OiubandF. W. Huntington of the Cali
fornia Swimming Club as judges and Pro-
Clyde Hawthorne. Who Broke the 100-
Yard >wimming Record.
lessor Harry Clark and F. B. Butz of the
Olympic Club and I. B. Riddle as time
keepers.
Dan Renear, who held the champion
ship, 1:033-5, had issued a challenge to
Clyde Hawthorne, a native son and cham
p on of Santa Cruz, and it was accepted.
Hawthorne, upon whose vest are attached
half a dozen medals awarded him for
various natatorial feats, wa* on hand, but
for some reason not given Renear did not
enter tbe race. The distance was the
length of the lon â¢ tank, with one turn.
Those who entered were Hawthorne, R. B.
Cornell, Champion of the California Swim
ming Club; Otto Sc uelte and Paul
Treanton, champion fifij-yard swimmer
of the Paciric Coa-*t.
In a moment after the start Hawthorne,
who is a very graceful swimmer, took thf
lead and kept it. He waÂ« closely followed
by Cornell, but after the turn Hawthorne
drew farther ahead and finished in 1:05 1-5,
breaking the record. Cornell came in
second in 1:08 3-5. The per ormance was
loudly applauded and the winner was sood
surroumled by a crowd of admirers
anxious to congratulate hiru.
Hawthorne, who is but 18 years of age,
has made several records, one in July at
Santa Cruz, when in a seventy-tire-yard
race, be beat his opponent twenty-five
feet and broke the record for that distance.
The record was :52 4-5, and he made it in
:48%.
'lne next important race on which time
was taken was one for professionals. The
contestants were Charies Cavill, champion
of Australia; M. H. Gay, champion 1000
-yard swimmer of the Pacific Coast, and
Dan Green, champion one-quarter-mile
swinjmerof tbe Pacific Coast. Tbe distance
was 450 yards. Cavill took the lead at the
start and held it to the finish, though at
one time it looke<i as if Green would be
the winner, particularly when he made a
spurt and came within a siroke or two of
passing tbe gentleman from Ausualia.
Gay, who had been exercisi ng freely just
previously to the race, could not keep up
with the others and drew out. Cavili's
time was 6:131-5 and Green's 6:16. At
the Terrace Baihs Green has a record of
6:13.
During the afternoon there was a 50
-yard race, hit-h diving by big and little
Casino, burlesques and parachute jumps
by Cornell and Empey and water polo.
Next Wednesday the California Swim
mine Club will have a grand gala per

REVIEWING THE
CONTROVERSY,
Synopsis of a Prelude De
livered by Rev. W. W.
Case Last Night
ACTIVITY MEANS LIFE.
The Speaker Gives His Idea of
What Religious Agita
tion Is.
SAY 3 IT MUST BE AGGRESSIVE.
He Discusses a Number of Articles
That Have Been Published in
the Chancellor's Paper.
Rev. Dr. Westwood Case at the evening
service In the Howard-street Methodist
Episcopal Church last evening gave as a
prelude "Excuses â The Monitor and Its
Little Hatchet." He said that activity
means life, and that it is a mistaken no
tion that religious agitation is detrimental
to godliness. Quoting Professor McCaffy
of Dublin he said:
"The most interesting and striking ser
mons I have ever heard were of a contro
versial nature. They were ihe contro
versial discourres against Popery, whicii
were once usual in all the evangelical
churches of Dublin and which were Uiider
taKen by tbe ablest men. These sermons
had real life in them."
Mr. Case then said:
A religion that is not aggressive will soon
become defunct. Our Roman Catholic neigh
bors are ever on the warpath. Generally there
is a still hunt. But of late the priests have got
their mouths wide open and are breathing out
words, words, words. Words without mean
ing, words without sense, misleading words,
but, nevertheless, a running a iarrhea of words.
Then the tune changes to braggtidocio, and
tne> talk about a club in their hands with
which they have been able to "split an organi
zation up thÂ« back." and buueomb supplies
the place of truth aDd argument. The fact is
they have been iaid out in every potition they
have undertaken to defend. Dr. Wendte used
them up so that there were only hair and toe
nails left. Dr. Dille wrapped the American
flag around ttie chancellor with so many folds
thHt he was smothered almost to death. He
will never soy "flag" again to that Galling
gun of Central Church. Mr. Ri t-s drove him to
the wall on the debate proposition and, as
many of you will remember, the speaker who
is now addressing yon made him eat his words
with which he accused us of misrepresenting
Father HecKer in our quotations from his
book and also in our quotations from "Gury's
Compendium."
My copy of Gury was sent to the editorial
sanctum of one or the great dailies of this City
for identification and was left there for the in
spection of auy one who might desire to exam
ine it. I here reiterate what I said in substance
before, and I say it with all the emphasis that
can possibly be put in;o words, auy man who
says I misquoted Gury utters a "falsehood,
nnmitigatfa fais- hood. I did not quote (rom
Mr. Yorke's copy of Gury, nor Archbishop Ire
land's copy of Gury, nor Pat Maloney's copy ot
(iury, but from my own copy, and I quoted
verbatim et literatim. This oueht to end the
controversy on that point forever.*
The speaker then dwelt at length on
what liad oeen shown in the matter of
Rev. J. H. Neison "who was arrested in
South America for printing in his paper
that '"to worship the Virgin Mary is
idolatry," and he then quoted from former
addresses, after which he said:
I have beenlrequently asked during the past
few weeks why I have not continued my lec
tures on polilicftl Romani-m. My reply has
been, ''So long as the priests will keep on talk
ing, Protestantism is being strengthened and
Romani-m ib losing its grin and 1 do not need
to keep up my lectures." Unwittingly the
open-mouthed priests are immensely strength
ening our cause. I; is secret Romanism that
is to be ieared. It is her bidden counsels tnat
threaten the life of the Nation.
I have been across the State In various
directions during toe summer and nothing
has surprised me more than the rapid growth
of Protestant sentiment and to find this growth
attributed almost as much to the shallow
sophistry of Rome's defenders as to the un
answerable ttrguments of the advocates of re
ligious and civil freedom.
The speaker then described the Monitor
as "a paper tit to be handled with tonga
only, and called attention to a publica
tion in tnat paper, in what purported to
be a letter from Arizona, of certain state
ments made concerning himself and other
Protestant clergymen. He then said:
The writer proves sylloglstically that the
Chancellor has proved nothing in all his
controversy . gainst us. â¢
In the chancellor's lecture in the Metro
politan Tempie last Monday night he says:
"No one now cares to fignt about trunsubutsa
tiation, auricular confession and other such
subjects." What doe* he mean by this? Does
he mean to say that the Catholic church has
abandoned thrse errors or is about. to abandon
them? Protestants are not ready, r>y tt:etr
6ilence or otherwise, to give any countenance
to the '-hocus pocus" of transubste -.itiativn.
It is outrageous ti> pretend to chance the
bread mid wine of the sacrament into the
literal, material body and btood oi Christ, and
yet this is the Romish doctrine of transub
stiin tiation. You do not have to take my word
for it.
The doctor then quoted from a book en
titled "The Sincere Christian Instructed,"
by the Right Rev. Bishop Hay, and con
tinued :
Tnere seems to be an effort on the part of the
editor of the Monitor to ideutiiy the American
Protective Associauon with Protestantism.
As well might we identify the tomperance
Betniment ot this country with the Prohibition
party and assume that it includes all the tem
pt ranee puople of the lana. r identify the
oder of Jesuits with the Catholic Church and
affirm that that order includes all Roman
Catholics, as to say that the American Pro
tective Association includes a .l Piotcstants. I
am not a member of that association, never
was a member, never entertained a thought
oi becoming a member, never expect to be
come a member, nor am 1 acquainted with a
half score of Methodist preachers whom I have
reason to believe are members. And yet lam
iree to Â»ay that the cardinal principles of the
order, so far aa I am acquainted with them, are
worthy of the highest commendation.
Not one in a hundred of the Protestants of
this country, so far as I am able to judge, are
members oi the American Protective Assoe.a
tion. They are, nevertheless, uncompromising
defenders of Protestant principles.
The Rev. Mr. Case then dwelt at iencth
upon the Chancellor's lecture on Papal
Infallibility, delivered at Metropolitan
Temple February 3, and took issue with
the Chancellor on the points he made in
that lecture. He then read the address of
the elegy and a laity of the diore c of
New York to His Holiness Pius IX, and
concluded by reading the resolutions that
were adopted at a meeting in the Academy
ol Music in New York on the occasion of
the celebration of Italian unity, and whicb
he said were an offset to the protests and
addresses of the Roman Catholics in this
country. _______________
CRICKET ACROSS THE BAY.
The Pacific and Bohemian Clubs Wore
the Heroes of the Dajr,
Tbree minutes to play and one run to
make to heat tlie Aianiedas was the inter
esting state of affairs for the Pacific Cricket
Club ye&terdoy, and a carefully placed 3
by Savior Mutch settled the matter. It
was one of the closest games or tbe season
and was thoroughly enjoyed by the spec
tators.
Captain Hogue of the Alamedas won the
toss and went in. He set a good example
by scoring a careful 33, and was soon fol
lowed by Ward Jr., who put up 49 in ex
cellent form. Randall, too, played a use
ful innings, but the rest of the team were |
very easily disposed of, the total register- |
ing 115 at the close of the innings. ;.
; Myers, Richardson, V Harbour and "ex
tras" were mainly responsible for the Pa
cifies* 119 for 8 wicket?. They had to con
tend against tbe bowling of SJoinan and
Peel, both of whom were in good form,
and aeainst remarkably smart fielding.
; The result firmly establishes the Pacifies
in the second place in the cup contest.

GAY CELTS CELEBRATE,
Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal
Benevolent Society's
Outing.
The Joyous Hibernians Entertain
Themselves and Guests at
Shell Mound.
Tha sixth annual celebration of the
Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal Benevo-
lent Society was held at Shell Mound
Park yesterday afternoon and evening,
the reputation of the members as first
class purveyors of wholesome amusement
being much more than sustained.
The piquant H.bernian element was
conspicuous 'aroughout, and representa
tives of numerous other nationalities were
on the ground in force, a circumstance
which goes to prove that the society en
joys a well-de3erved popularity among
outsiders. A more orderly crowd withal
could scarrely be desired.
The several committees of management
had not been idle, and the entire day's
programme, thanjts to theio* conscientious
arrangement of preliminaries, passed off
wit hout a serious hitch of any kind.
The day's proceedings evolved many in
cidents." When Mrs. Mary Karney won the
second prize in the race for married
women Mrs. O'Snllivan, who was ap
parently third, waxed wroth and assured
the judges that she, although 60 years of
a?p, cou d beat her opponent "any day."
Whereu,>on some considerate onlookers
suggested a n atcli race, which, however,
did not materialize. The race for mar
riageable young ladies brought forth a per
fect galaxy of beauty and when tbe whistle
blew the appreciative spectators were
treated to a bewildering display of flying
"Trilbies." The fat la lies race was also
an exhilarating exhibition of hard -print
ing, though the avoirdupois of several
competitors was undoubtedly without the
mean me of the adjective â so much so, in
fact, that one lady was finally di-qualifisd.
"You don't call yourself fat?" queried the
starter. "Certainly I do," replied the
lady, but it wouldn't go.
But the greatest feature of the day was
the jig ami reel dancing for both sexes,
in which Miss May Kavansmgh and J. J.
O'Connor were given ri'rst place alter an
exciting contest, Piper McCarthy dis
pla>ed ureat skill. Both pipe and fiddle
playeii harmoniously together.
The distribution of gate prizes later in
the day save great satisfaction. The fine
gold wutch, valued at $60, was drawn by
No. 3852.
.Music of a distinctively national and
patriotic characirr was ably presmted at
intervals by the Home Rule Union Band.
Following is a complete list of prize-win
ners, to.-ettier with the nnrne* of tbe
gentlem n constituting the different com

REPUBLICAN RALLY.
Eastern Congressman to Talk In
the Auditorium To-Morrow
Night.
To-morrow evening there will be a grand
Republican rally in the Auditorium, cor
ner of Eddy and Jones streets, where
those who attend will have a treat from
prominent Eastern speakers. One of these,
an eloquent and forcible talker, is the
Hon. 8. W. McOall, who is now for the
third successive term representing the
Eighth Congressional District of Massa
chusetts.
He is tbe author of the phrase used by
Bryan, "Pressing tbe crown of thorns on
the brow of labor." Another is the Hon.
L. D. Apsley, vice-chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Com
mittee, and w!Â»<> represents the Fourth
Congressional District of Massachusetts.
The utterances of these gentlemen, who,
after that meoting, will return to their
own State, will be a treat, as they are
thoroughly conversant with the political
situation at this time.
Only ten per cent of dowers give out a

The Power
OfJManhood.
It is good to feel strongâ to know that
you are as vieorous as your fellow man.
Then you have nothing to r^cret in your
past lifeâ nothing that has left you weak
i in body and mind.
You can be strong. You can make your
i nerves wiry and powerful by charging
them with electricity from Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt.
There are thousands of happy men who
proclaim to the world the great benefits
i derived from this wonderful Belt. It
cured them after other remedies had failed
to do so.
, The following are extracts from letters
recently received:
"I am a laboring man and for many years
i was a sufferer froJh (seminal weakness, which
i so debilitated me at times before I bought
| your Belt that on many occasions I had to
! give up my work. I wore the Belt continu-
ously at night for three months, and at the
; end of that time I was well and strong. I
j cannot say too much, in praise of your Belt
â¢ and do not intend to part with mine" the rest
!of my life."â P. H. Gale, Indio. Cnl. .
"I would liKe to add my testimony to the
numerous others in possession of Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt Co. I bought a strong-rower
Belt from Dr. Sanden about the Ist of April,
which I used according to directions, and
after three months I am happy to stitet.iat
ray .varicocele, wnich was of twelve years'
standing, is almost entirely disappeared. I
take great pleasure in recommencing the Belt
;to any one suffering from varicoeele."â W. E.
Johns, 1139 Market St., San Francisco.
"I bought your Belt inree weeks ago for kid-
ney and bladder trouble. I had previous to
that time been laid up in bed for live weeks.
My trouble came: on me last 'March, and; on
many occasions I was so bad that I wan con-
fined to my ' bed. The third time that I put
your Belt oh I found relief and liave kept Im-
proving ever siuce. I will take great pleasure
in recommending your Belt."â VV. T. Myers,
135 Kast Twemy-iourth st., Los Angeles, Cal.
Every day Dr. Sanden : receives letter!
like these. The evidence is so power.'ul,
the letters so grateful and the good done
by this Ben so general that it must bt
considered a great remedy.
DO YOU FEEL WEAK? Do you lack
energy and vigor? Is your power waning!
If so read Dr. Sanden's oook, "Three
Classes of Men." It can be had free,
sealed, on request. Address or call

FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM HcKINLET, of Ohio
FOB VICF-PRKBIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
IXKCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
We have a great Nation and we must
keep it great.
No one is buying silver in the market.
No one is betting on Bryan.
Tbe Democrats may fool some of the
Populists but not all of the Populists this
time.
The country must have a revenue equal
to its expenditures aud none but boy ora
tors deny it.
Watson might take a noble revenge on
Bewail by going to Maine and stumping
the State for him.
Now that good citizens have ceased to
feel anxious about the result they can en
joy the music of the campaign.
Remove Democratic legislation from the
statute books and Democratic conditions
will be removed from the country.
Efforts to arouse class antagonisms be
tween labor aud capital may be politics of
a kind, but it is a very poor kind.
It will be noted that the men who are
leaving the Democratic party are the men
fybo have been always considered the best
J)emocrats.
There is no one to whom protection is of
more importance than the farmer. A
prosperous home market means good
prices for him.
Up to date Bryan in the East and Sena
tor White in the We3t are having the
Democratic stump all to themselves and
perhaps they enjoy it.
"Vote for Bryan and get $2forsl" would
be more promising if it were not said by
the men who shouted "Vote for Cleveland
end get $1 25 for wheat."
The campaign is now open wide enough
for everybody to get in 80 there is no
longer an excuse for not joining a .Repub
lican club and keeping up with the pro
cession.
If the farmers will support home facto
ries the factories will furnish a home mar
ket for farm products, money will circu
late from town to country, trade will be
lively and all will be prosperous.
While the Popocrat demagogues are
shouting "Down with the rich," the Re
publican party advances with the cry "Up
with the poor" and proposes the enact
ment of measures that will provide work
for the workers and prosperity for all.
"I would willingly defend free trade
with my life," said Mr. Bryan in his first
speech in Congress, and as he is now de
fending free silver with his tongue only
it is easy to see to which policy he is most
devoted. s
If the Wilson free-trade law had not
taken work from Americans and given it
to foreigners there would have been a bet
ter home market for home produce, less
would have been sent abroad and as a
consequence there would have been better
prices ail round.
Work for wage-earners puts money into
circulation and revives trade, work for
wage-earners mases a good market and
raises prices of home products, work for
wage-earners keeps the home in comfort,
work for waÃe-earners makes the land
prosperous, but there is no work for wage
earners in this country when free-traders
rule.
While Cleveland has been in office oar
Government has been adverse to interna
tional bimetallism, but when McKinley is
President the whole influence of tbe
United States will be exerted to bring
about the free coinage of silver both in
Europe and in America and good results
are sure to be obtained in much less time
than many people expect.
The Indiana Farmers' Association.which
has about 50,000 members, hitherto classi
fied as 27,000 Republicans, 21,000 Demo
crats, 1000 Populist and 1000 Prohibition
ists, has been recently canvassed by the
president of the organization with the re
sult that Qver 42,000 of them declare they
will vote for McKinley and sound money.
The silver sentiment said to exist among
them disappeared on investigation.
Every producer knows that the prod
ucts of bis industry need protection from
foreign competition, every business man
knows that trade is best under the pro
tective system, every artisan knows it
takes protection to advance work aud
wages in this country; and, therefore, to
every producer, to every man of business
and every workingman the tariff is ne
cessarily the issue of greatest importance
to bis interest, his industry and his pros
perity.
THE NEED OF PROTECTION.
We renew and emphasize our allegiance
to the policy of protection as the bulwark of
American industrial independence and the
foundation of American development and
prosperity. We denounce the present Demo
cratic tariff as sectional, injurious to the pub
lic credit and destructive to business enterprise.
We demand such, equitable tariff on foreign
imports which come into competition with
American products as will not only furnish
adequate revenue for the necessary expenses
of the Government, but will protect American
labor from degradation to the wage level of
other lauds.
The money question is an important is
sue in this campaign, but the facts show,
as Major McKinley says, that what is
most to be desired now is to have our in
dustries opened to labor, not only for
labor's sake, but to protect the country
from bankruptcy. The Government must
have revenue to pay expenses, and wage
earners must have work, but the Govern
ment cannot have revenue nor can the
wage-earner have work so long as the
Wilson-Gorman tariff act is in operation.
DurinsÂ» the first twenty-two months of
the McKiuley law our foreign trade bal
ance was in our favor by $245,000, 090, and
only $150,000,000 under the Wilson-Gorman
act for the same number of months. That
is to say, we lost 595,000,000 by substituting
protection for free trade in twenty-two
months.
The total receipts of the United States
treasury in the same months was $660,
-000,000 under the McKinley act and $558
-000,000 under the Wilson-Gorman act dur
ing the same number of months.
The total treasury deficiency from July
1, 1893, to July, 1896, was $148,000,000. Thus
we have a treasury loss of $148,000,000 and
a foreign trade loss of $95,000,000, making
a grand total of $243, 000,000. During this
period foreign syndicates took from us
$95 000,000 of gold.
For the fiscal year 6nding in 1893 our
customs amounted to $203,000,000, for the
year ending 1596 they amounted to $159,
-000,000. The yearly average decrease of
revenues under the Wilson-Gorman act,
as compared with tbe McKinley act, have
been $35,000,000. Had the McKinley act
been in operation daring 1895 and 1896 the
customs revenue would have averaged
$192,000,000 a year as against $155,000,000
under the Wilson-Gorman act.
As will be seen these figures represent
the Government loss only. The direct loss
to tne people in dollars has been very
much greater, to say nothing about tbe

No man can outdo me in opposition to
monopolies; but the manufacturers of this
country should not be thus characterized.
They have no princely fortunes; in general
tliey have no independent means. Their all is
in the brick and mortar of their establish

in their trade. And how many of them to

SENATOR WHITE TALKS.
Senator Stephen M. White addressed a
San Francisco audience of fellow-Demo
crats Saturday night Either Senator
White did not know what he was talking
about or he deliberately played upon the
supposed ignorance and stupidity of his
hearers. He said: "The Bland act made
silver a legal tender, and thus far it was
all that could be asked, but it limited tbe
functions and power of silver to the ex
tent of its coinage."
If there is now or ever was a "Bland
act" the peopleof the United State 3 would
be obliged to Senator White if he will in
form them when and where it was enacted.
The records of the proceedings of no Con
gress make mention of any such act. In
1877 Congressman Bland introduced a Iree
silver coinage bill in Congress, but it never
became an "act." His bill was revamped,
however, and when it reappeared before
Congress it bore little if any resemblance
to the original bill. It was then called the
"Allison- Bland" bill, and it subsequently
became "an act of Congress."
No doubt it was the Allison-Bland act
Senator White referred to, but whether so
or not, it is very evident that he got him
self very much mixed ud. He said the
act "limited the functions and power of
silver because it restricted the extent of
its coinage." Since when did silver have
"functions and power" (of money) in any
form other than as coin ? The meaning of
the Senator's assertion is that because tbe
coinage of silver bullion into silver dollars
was restricted, silver bullion was deprived
of the functions and power of silver dol
lars. That ia what silver-mine owners
complain of.
The idea of tbe Senator appears to be
that it is the duty of the Government to
confer the function and power of money
upon silver bullion, and in order to do
that the price of silver should be advanced
by law to where silver bullion weighing
371Ji grains would have the same "func
tion and power" as that number of grains
in the form of a coin. In other words,
Senator White is very anxious about silver
bullion, and wants free coinage of silver
so that bullion will have the function and
power of coins. The Senator out-Bryans
Bryan.
But Senator White was good enough to
admit that there is no certainty at all that
the Democratic party's free silver coinage
scheme would work. He said: "Never
can there be a fair test between gold and
silver until both are given the same
chance before the law." This is an ad
mission that the Democratic party is play
ing a game of chance with the monetary
system of the country, and that no one
can foretell what the outcome will be. Ex-
Governor Boies is quite in accord with
Senator White. He says free coinage
would be an experiment, but he wants to
begin and keep on tinkering with the
country's circulating medium until the
"right spot is touched."
Senator White should be sufficiently
weli acquainted with the people to know
that they are not Interested in conferring
the function and power of money upon
silver or cold bullion for the sake of the
bullion, nor are they in any mood for ex
perimental work upon or tinkering with
the country's monetary system. But
thanks are due the Senator for emphasiz
ing the fact that Democrats tio not know
enough about economics to be trusted
with the affairs of the Government.
The people are settled in one purpose this
year â they will not tolerate the surrender of
any mere of their business and will as quickly
as possible recover what they have already
lost. Tliey know hoio they lost it and they
know when they lost it, and they know how to
get it back, and they mea n to do it.â Me-

WAGE-EARNERS KNOW.
Hon. M. til. Estee made a rattling good
speech and suomitted unanswerable argu
ments to a large gathering of .Republicans
Saturday night. The reason why there
vere not more people in the Auditorium
was because there was not evea standing
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, ACGUST 31, 1896.
room for more. As was to be expected,
the audience was composed of business
men and wat;e-earnera, and their enthusi
asm cave plenty of evidence that they are
taking an earnest and active part in the
campaign â a campaign for the overthrow
of a policy of governmental management
that has well nigh closed the avenues of
trade and industry.
Mr. Estee's speech was a clear and com
prehensive analysis of the economic con
ditions of the country at this time, and
with great clearness he pointed out the
remedy. The sentiment expressed in the
following wa3 the central idea:
If we had good times generally and sent no
money abroad, then gold and silver would
both circulate at home. But such is not the
case and cannot be the case until we have pro
tection. Tnen the laborers will have more 10
do, and the Increased demand for workers will
increase the price of work. Tne means to pay
the workers comes from the results of their
toil and not from tha amc-sat of silver in cir
culation. Labor produces things first and
money afterward, and the p#ice these things
sell for is regulated by the demand. Protect
our home market and there will be a good de
mand and a good price. The things so pro
dutea are the wealth of ihe country, and when
the things are sold, money, as a symbol of
wealth, is paid and received for them, and to
secure the producer a good price money should
be both good and abundant.
No doubt labor understands the im
portance of opportunity to earn mon<;y
better than any other class of our people.
No wage-earner is bothering himself about
the country's financial system. He wants
plenty of work at good wages. He knows
that only good sound, full and complete
dollars have been in use in the country
since the Republican party came in power
in 1861, and he knows there is no danger
of any form of our money being degraded
under Republican rule. He knows that
when the industries resume again and the
channels of commerce are cleared of ob
struction a larger volume of money will
be required and that naturally any in
crease in the circulating money medium
would be from a larger use of silver.
Meanwhile, however, he wants to do only
that which will create a demand for his
brain and brawn. Not a demand for a
day's work now and then, but a demand
for every day that shall be fully equal to
the supply.
The workingman knows that he must
produce things to exchange for money be
fore he cau expect to have money, and
hence his anxiety to see mill, factory
and shop swing their doors wide open
and invite labor to accept permanent em
ployment. And hence, too, his enthu
siasm for the cause that is sure to secure to
him that which he most desires â plenty of
wort at good wages â which he knows will
not be secured to him until the Republi
can party is returned to power. Peace and
plenty and not a war of classes are what
the American wage-earner wants, and he is
greatly mistaken who thinks tbe labor of
this country is not a keen observer of pass
ing events xn the political world. Iv fact
it may be said that wonting people are
better posted on economics than ever De
fore, and one only need to see how they
are flocking to McKinley's banner to be
convinced that they know where to look
for a deliverer from the mire and mud of
Democratic free trade.
The prosperity and wealth of every nation
must depend upon its productive industry.
The farmer is stimulated to exertion by find
ing a ready market for his surplus products
and by being able to exchange them without
loss of time or expense of transportation for
the manufacture* which his comfort or con
venience requires. This is always done to the
best advantage where a portion of the com
munity in which he lives is engaged in other
pursuits. â President Filimore.
COAST EXCHANGES.
Cottage Grove, Or., has a new weekly news
paper, the Moderator, of which H. W, Ross is
editor and proprietor. Tbe publication makes
a very creditable appearance. Political ques
tions are discussed strictly from a non-partisan
and economic point of view.
H. H. Walling has retired from the Placer
ville Nugget and R, V. Robertson will hence
forth be sole proprietor. The paper is only six
months old, but has prospered beyond the ex
pectations of its founders. The Nugget believes
that "at all times the Republican party does
thatwbich is right and wise," and, therefore,
it will strive hard lor what it deems for the
best interests of the party of Lincoln, Grant
and Garfield.
The Marysville Graphic is a little four-page
paper which has just made its initial appear
ance in Yuba County's capital. J. M. Morrisey
is the publisher, and the Graphic will preach
Democracy weekly during the campaign.
The first number of the Riverside Daily News
is at band. It is an independent paper, favor
ing free silver and advocating the Republican
principle 01 protection. L. W. Allum <fc Son are
the proprietors.
The Orphan's Cry, a publication issued on
the first day of every alternate month at San
Jose, has been received for August. It is de
voted to tbe interests of child-saving and child-
reform, is non-sectarian and interdenomina
tional and deserves support on account of its
most worthy object.
Eureka may possibly find itself the possessor
of a new daily paper before the Coming of an
other moon. The Western Watchman of that
city is contemplating such a movement in the
interest of free silver. What is now needed is
the wherewith to start the proposed daily.
The Watchman already has an option on a tele
graph service.
Fresno is to have a cream-of-tartar factory.
Tbe Republican of that city says with refer
ence to the projected new industry: "V. Cour
tois & Co., of San Francisco, have made
arrangements to establish a cream-of-tartar
factory in this city and will begin operations
in September. The old Dexter stables at the
corner of Inyo and I streets have been rented
by the company and will be refitted for the
factory. The company will invest $10,000 and
will engage in the manuiacture of the product
on a large scale.
"The waste of the wineries will be used in
the manufacture and it is understood that the
company has already contracted with the
Eisen and Granz wineries. The wastes used
will be the pressed grapes, the lees and the
argol or crude tartar of the wine vats. Here
tofore these residues have been thrown away
in Fresno wineries, but the new establishment
will make use of them. The field is an ex
cellent one, which was evidently realized by
the San Francisco capitalists."
The San Bernardino Free Press has come out
in a complete and elegant new dress. Its en
terprising publisher, H. C. Warner, is meeting
with that success which always waits on push,
pluck and talent.
Tulare City's fruit cannery is running with a
heavy force and will be in operation till the
end of September. The Tulare Times says, in
regard to it:
"Much of the finest brands of canned
peaches will be made here from the Phillips
cling and White Heath. Somewhat higher
wages will be paid the cutters and canners
while this fruit is being packed, for tbe great
est care in handling will be exacted. A new
machine, called the gravity can-labeler, was
tried at tbe cannery two or three days ago.
The inventor, Mr. Simmons, was present to
watcn its workings and keep it regulated. He
claims that it will label 2000 cases in one day of
ten hours with the help of seven persons.
This means 48,000 cans. With the aid of six
men besides himself Mr. Simmons put the
labels on 3240 cans in one hour the other day.
Mr. Bentley says the great objection to all
these labeling machines U that they will waste
labels, and handsoniley lithographed labels
cost too much to allow waste."
With reference to the deterring influence on
oil discovery and development in this State of
the cxpltiitatioaa of adventurers Viiio had no
practical knowledge of oil regions, the Fresno
Expositor mates these sensible remarks:
"The discovery of oil at Livermore adds one
more important find to the many which have
rewarded the efforts of California petroleum
seekers during the last few years. Oil is now
produced in paying quantities at Los Angeles,
Coalinga, Summerfield, Santa Paula and pos
sibly at two or three other points, though it is
by no means certain that the greater reser
voirs whijh undoubtedly exist have yet been
tapped. The number of points where good in
dications appear are many, but in tbe past
and, to some extent, in the present, circum
stances which might easily be changed nave
retarded their development.
"What we refer to is the fraudulent boring
that has been going oh for years, and which,
through the disappointments il has caused,
Has put a stop to oil prospecting in many
promising localities. The Livermore discovery
was deferred for a decade because of a well
borer who was after the money ot his backers
and not after oil. He sank a pipe to a depth cf
200 feet, struck nothing of value, and received
$4000 for his pains. With the failure of the
weil popular belief in tbe presence of petro
leum under their feet died out among the
people of Livermore, who did not know that
an honest experiment had not been made.
But for a resident who had a notion or two
of geology they would yet be doubting Thom
ases. This man went to work to find oii and
got it at a deptli of nine feet. Now Livermore
is reported to be in 'a flutter of excitement 1
"Confidence men have found no more profit
able trade for years than 10 start out with a
boring apparatus, convince some farmer or
community thut they had found signs of pe
troleum or gas, and then, if contracted with,
proceed to sink a well in any handy place.
Knowing nothing of geological formations,
tnese swindlers usually hit a spot where a
discovery of anything except bowlders or pet
rified shells would bo impossible, but that
mattered nothing to them. They were boring
for the contract price. A mile away there
may have been oil fields, or there may have
been none in the county, but the record of the
boring failure becoming Known had its de
terrent effect upon oil prospecting all over
the State.
"If this danger of fraud could be avoided
we believe a general scientific exploration of
oil would follow, and that great good would
come of It. The case is one that might well
enlist a syndicate of responsible capitalists,
who for a share in any raying well discov
ered would stand ready to investigate.through
a geologist and an honest boring party, any
promising oil land in California. In this way
there would be systematic and thorough work
done and no fraud attempted, while in the
long run the oil resources of the State would
come to be properly understood and their
commercial value utilized."

The surprising growth of Tuolumne County,
as revealed by the registration of 1896, is
shown forth in the Sonora Union- Democrat.
The productiveness of its mines has made it
one of the most prosperous counties in the
State. An increase of 3400 in population in
loss than two years and during a period when
depression has been more or less universal is
something Tuolmnne County may well boast
over. Here is what the Union- Democrat has to
say on the subject:
'â In proportion to population or in equal
ratio no county in this State, so far as heard
from, can equal, much less eclipse, Tuolumne
in the increase of population or in the pros
perity that it has been the pood fortune of its
residents to enjoy since 1894. Out of a total
number of twenty-seven voting precincts
twenty-two show a substantial increase over
the vote of 1894. One remains the same and
four show an aggregate loss of forty-one votes,
as figured at the ratio of votes to population,
which is one to five. The four precincts of
Algarine, Browns Flat, Shaws Flat and Santa
Mtiria reveal a loss in population of 205, while
the twenty-two precincts that show an increase
show a voting gain of 774 and a gain in popu
lation of 3870, leaving a net gnin in votes for
the whole county of 682 and a net gain in pop
ulation of 3410.
'â¢Tiiose fleures, it must be understood, are
considerably under the mark, for the reason
that no especial eifbrt was made to bring out n.
full registration this year, ocensioned by the
absence of a local ticket iv the field. In addi
tion to the loss of registered voters such apa
thetic conditions necessarily create, there is a
large percentage of the miners employed in
the county who are not. citizens and could not
therefore be placed on the register. It is safe
to estimate the number as high as 20 per cent,
which seems to ebow the conservatism of the
estimated increase of population. It, of course,
goes without saying that no such increase
could be possible unless there was presented
an inviting field for the business man and the
miner to profitably employ themselves in the
forthcoming banner county of the State
which Tuolumne is destined to be."
DANIEL WEBSTER ON RECIPROCITY
Speech In Congress Anrll 2, 1824.
Commerce is not a gambling among nations
for a stake, to be won by some and lost by
others. It has not the tendency necessarily to
impoverish one of the parties to it, while it
enriches the other; all parties gain, all parties
make profits, all parties grow rich by the ope
ration of just and liberal commerce. If the
world had but one clime and but one soil, if all
men had the same wants and the same means,
on the spot of their existence, to gratify their
wants, then, indeed, what one obtained from
the other by exchange would injure one party
in the same degree that it benefited the other ;
then, indeed, there would be some foundation
for the balance of trade. But Providence has
disposed our lot much more kindly. We in
habit a various earth. We have reciprocal
wants and reciprocal means of gratifying one
another's wants. This is the true origin of
commerce, which is nothing more than an ex
change of equivalents, and, from the rude bar
ter of its primitive state to the refined and
complex condition in which we see it, its prin
ciple is uniformly the same, its only object
being in ever stage to produce that exchange
of commodities between individuals and be
tween nations which Bhall conduce to the ad
vantage and happiness of both.
BRYAN'S LACK OF SINCERITY.
Chicago Inter Ocean.
Mr. Bryan is in no small danger of forfeiting
public respect by a kind of intellectual jug
glery when he makes a speech. He should
know that above all things tho American peo
ple demana in their President a man of sin-
eerily, one who is not ' afraid of the shadow
cast by his political opinion. ; Even Buchanan
and Cleveland never forfeited public confi
dence in their sincerity. Mr. Bryan has hardly
made a speech that he did not practice a kind
of jugglery. He will; have to stop that or the

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Dr. Augustus Marques.a noted theosophlst of
Italian nativity, but who has for some years
been living in Hawaii, has arrived here and is
at the Grand. Tlie doctor is a very interesting
conversationist, and on the subject of the
osophy is unusually interesting.
He is credited with a number of very im
portant discoveries in theosophy. lor in
stance, he holds that all human beings are sur
rounded with human emanations called
human aura. These emanations are egg
shaped and (tive forth a great variety of most
brilliant colors.
"Many persons can see these with the naked
eye," said the doctor yesterday. "It is well
known that railway engineers and ship pilots
can see| an astounding distance. Others have
Dr. Augustus Marques, the Noted Theosophist, Now Here, Whose Eyes Are
So Good That He Can See the Mysterious Human Aura.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
been able to fcee so well that they have been
credited with microscopic eyes. My own eyes
are so good that I can see over many persons a
halo, being part of the human aura.
"With the revelations of the Roentgen ray
and other discoveries which are constantly
being made the horizon of scientific study is
daily growing and the human mind is en
abled to penetrate into mysterious regionsâ
the domain of the great Uuknownâ which
were undreamed of only a few years ago. But it
is a rathe remarkable fact that the new line of
study, called theosophy, is constantly fore
stalling scientific discoveries, so that science
seems to come in only of 1 ate as a corrobora
tlon of theosophicai tenets.
"Occultism has for centuries stated that
everything in nature, from the mineral np to
man, is surrounded by a sort of special ema
nation or fluidic cloud called aura, whicn con
stitutes a kind of limited atmosphere around
every being:, in the same way as every star and
planet is surrounded by its own special atmos
phere.
â¢â¢But just as the Roentgen ray is invisible
to ordinary vision, though it is powerfully ac
tive, so the human aura is also invisible to or
dinary sight, yet persons gifted with abnormal
powers, called psychics or clairvoyants, readily
discern it with more or less deftness and are
able to describe the interesting minuteness of
its division and its brilliant colors.
"This aura was described by Paracelsus 300
years ago and was studied some fifty years
back by the celebrated Baron Relchenbach.
Materialistic, scientists, however, who are not
very well developed in clairvoyant vision,
stubbornly refused to admit its existence until
at last it was corroborated by photography."
Two French scientists, Dr. Baradue and Dr. (
Lebon, have just published books and photo
graphs on the human aura which fully con
firm the teachings of occultism in the matter
and their discoveries are eoing to open a new
field for the scientific study of the aura. In
the meanwhile, this subject Had for years been
studied by members of the Theosophicai So
ciety, producing some interesting articles pub
lished in the theosophicai literature. But in
dependently of all this, however, Dr. Marques
has made a very special and thorough study of
tbe subject and he has had the good fortune of
obtaining the help of some very scientific
seers, gifted with clairvoyant sight in their
normal state, without trance or hypnotic in
fluence.
Thus, the result of his observations covers
some new discoveries and interesting facts
never before elucidated, so that his lecture
will prove of considerable scientific interest.
One of these facts is the action of the human
aura in connection with the disease germs
that float in the atmosphere, and with the pos
sibilities of contagion without direct, bodily
contact, certain ailments being transmittable
through the aura, which extends to nearly
two feet around the physical body.
Dr. Marques lectured last night in the Native
Sons' building. Mason street. Dr. Marques is
president ot the Aloha lodge of Theoeopnists
at Honolulu.

With Eczema
I mi b stifferer for eight yearÂ« from Eczema, but
now am entirely cured. The palms of my hands
were covered and badly inflamed; little white
blister* appeared, then would peel off, leaving
a red, smooth surface, which would burn like
fire and itch. On the inside of the upper part of
my limbs, great red blotches would appear, and
as soon as I became warm, the burning and itch-
ing would begin. Night after night 1 would lie
awake and scratch, and almost go wild. I got a
box of Coticdba, and a bottle of Ccticcra Rb-
bolvent, and alter a few applications I noticed
the redness and inflammation disappear; before I
had used one box there teat not a tif/n of Eczema
left. I can truthfully asuert that $2.00 worth of
Cuticuba Remedies cured me. . _.

NEWS ON THE
WATER FRONT,
The Phenomenal Luck of
Fisherman William
Sarlund.
WITH LOADED TROUSERS
And " Blinker Brown" Rolling
a Pseudo Drunk Was
Hooked.
LANDED IN THE CITY PEISON.
Most of the Cargo and Machinery of
the Wrecked Co ombia Have
Been Removed.
William Sarlund is a fisherman of credit
and renown, and has just made the catch
of the season.
William lives at the bayside inn of
Wary Sandlin, located at 206 Steuart
street. Around in the neiehborhood may
be seen a water-froni character known as
! "Blinker Brown," who possesses an un
| savory police record. At the Sacramento
street station he is listed as a "arunk
roller," a conscienceless individual who
rolls intoxicated people over for profit as
they are dreaming blissfully on the hard
dock-planks.
Last Friday night Sarlund fell into the
hands of "Blinker" Brown and permitted
"Blinker" to absorb $3 25 of his money.
It is needless to say that Sarlund was
snoring a midnight hymn to the pale
face moon, with his head against a spar
and his feet hanging over the end of the
wharf, at the time the transfer took place.
"When Sarlund came back from the lotus
land of dreams he missed his money and
straightway kicked.
His kick appealed to the sympathetic
soul of Mrs. Sandlin and she set a trap for
"Blinker" Brownâ or, rather, she set a
hook for him.
While Sarlund was finishing his nap in
bed like a respectable person she took his
, trousers and sewed fishhooks on tbe inside
! of his pockets, the treacherous barbed
i things set so they would not fail to hold
| whatever entered there. Then she placed
j a few jingling coins in those loaded
pockets and made Sarlund get up and
dress.
He was instructed to keep his own hands
| out of his own pockets and lie around
: promiscuously wbere "Blinker" could find
i him. This he did, and Brown was soon
noticed to be loitering suspiciously in the
vicinity of the pseudo-drunk, baited for his
benefit. The fisherman play<sd his role
j well, and the human fish presently
i plunged his hand into Sariund's pocket,
I and, as he clutched the coins, the nooks
I snatched him.
Then there was a howl. The more
Brown tried to withdraw the deeper the
hooks went into his flesh. The struggles of
Sarlund didn't help matters any. and
when Officers Cailahan and Dillon
swooped down upon the pair the would-be
"drunk-roller's" undoing was complete.
The hooks were with difficulty extracted
| from his wounded hand and he was
i marched away to the Harbor Police Sta
tion. The trousers, with loaded pockets
and tbe coins he didn't get, accompanied
him as evidence of his criminal blunder.
Tbe tug Alert, Captain Brokaw, re
turned Saturday night from the wreck of
the Colombia at Pigeon Point with sloop
Voiante in tow. The latter vessel was
loaded with the donkey boiler of the lost
steamship, the remains of hfer engines
and a large amount of the damaged cargo.
Captain Drisko, who has been busily strip
ping the wreck, has so far cleaned but the
nuii that little more remains aboard.
The main boilers have been loosened
from the bottom plates and the Yolante
Will take down a derrick for the purpose of
completing the work. Some of the cargo
yet remains in the forward hold and dyna
mite will be used to get it out. The side of
The Colombia will be blown out, and what
will not float ashore will be secured by
divers. The propeller will be broken off
by tbe explosion, and both it and the shalt
removed from the steamer.
AT THE THEATERS.
What the Theater Goers May Expect
See la the Playhouses This
livening.
To-night the audience at the Baldwin

city of the much talked-of and much writ
ten about "Mme. Sans Gene." Kathryn
Kidder is said to give an excellent por
trayal of the title role and Augustus Cook
a perfect picture of Napoleon L
"The Social Trust" is to be given again
to-night at the Columbia Theater and it
will be given during the remainder of the
week. It is a play that has been well re
ceived and is entitled to the reception it
received, for it certainly is a good play.
After having been closed for about six
weeks the Alcazar is to reopen to-night
with "Turned Up," a play that was made
such a success by JS T at Goodwin. It is to
be put on the boards with fine scenery
and theieading character will be assumed
by Frank Doane, the comedian.
The new soubrette Lottie Williams and
the near comedian Edward J. Herron, who
captured the audiences at the Grand Opera
hou?e last wees, will appear this evening
at this place of amusement in a sensa
tional melodrama, "Heid in Slavery," one
that is fui. 1 of thrilling situations.
"Ernani" is on the bill at the Tivoli
Opera-house for this evening. In this
well-known production Signor Michelena
will appear in the character of tbe bandit
chief, Kaffael is to appear in the character
or the King of Spain and Nina Bertini
Humphreys will appear as Gilda.
The bill to be offered at the Orpheum
Music Hall is a strong one and the many
specialties are sure to please the patrons
of ibis house. The Cosnian couple, from
Australia, are announced to appear in
song, dialogue and dance. Wilson and
Erroi will give "Men vs. Women."
There will be a vaudeville performance
in the Casino at the Haight-street grounds

CITIZEN SOLDIERS
OF THE STATE.
Governor Budd, the Coramander-in-
Chief of the National Guard of California,
has returned from his horseback outing in
the high Sierra and is now able by reason
of his practice march to take tbe field with
a troop of cavalry.
Major-General James expected the
Governor and Adjutant Barrett to meet
him here in conference in general affairs
last Saturday, but the Governor sent word
for the division general to wait.
The Adjutant-General came down from
Sacramento last Saturday. Captain Car
rington, U. S. A., on duty as inspector of
the State troops, also came in from Sacra
mento Saturday la>t. The recommenda
tion in his report that the cavalry com
pany of Los Angeles should be mustered
out has caused some criticism in that city.
Captain Carrington is said to favor the or
ganization of a light battery for the guard
of this S tate, and in this respect his views
are indorsed by many other military men.
It can be seen now thai a mistake was
made in disbanding the old light battery
in San Francisco.
The latest addition to the staff of Major-
General N. I. James is the appointment
of J. H. Mangels lieutenant-colonel and
commissary. When the appointment was
tendered Colone 1 Mangels was serving on
the staff of Brigadier-General Warfield,
as quartermaster with the rank of major.
It is said that other members of General
Warfield's staff have been invited to join
the major-general's military family. The
suggestion has been made that the major
general should do his staff recruiting in
ano'her field.
First Brigade.
PASADENA, Cau. Aug. 28.â Company
I, Seventh infantry, of Pasadena held its
regular monthly target shoot on Friday,
August 21.
Captain N. S. Bangham of Company I
has gone to Chilano for recreation in the
mountains, and will with his family be
absent two weeks.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Aug. 25.â
Preliminary practice for the semi-annual
State shoot will commence in Company X,
Seventh Infantry, this week, and a great
deal of interest is b*ing shown even at this
early date in the coming contest for State
decorations. It is to be regretted that the
ruling made last spring, compelling a man
to make a score of 30 at the June practice
to be allowed to compete for a medal in
September, haÂ» not been revoked. It cer
tainly does not encourage target practice
in the guard, and seems to have the effect
of lessening the interest in this very im
portant part of a soldier's education.
The officers and men are delighted with
tbe prospect of better ammunition in the
future. The shells furnished lor the last
State practice were of a very inferior
quality and no doubt helped to lower the
scores of some of the best shots in the com
pany.
The new non-coms appeared in all the
glory of new chevrons and stripes on Mon
day evening, but it wns a pretty hard mat
ter for them to "look straight to the
front," the sight of their new sleeve deco
rations being a little too much for their
vanity. It is to be hoped that none of
them will become cross-eyed.
Sergeant Sboup is again on duty with
tbe company after a very severe illness of
several months.
The literary society of the company
known as "The Philopolemicae" will open
its fail meetings on Monday evening, Sep
tember?, with a moot court. Ex-Privaie
Henry Ingram will be the presiding judge.
The first case on the docket is the cele
brated breach-of-promise suit of Angelina
Drusella Ferres ft. Don Juan Carter.
Lieutenants Sloat and 8 ccombe will ap
pear as counsel for the lair and thin plain
tiff, while Sereeants Rountree and Shoup
will do battle for the gay Don Juan.
Dr. J. N. hayless, a very substantial
friend of the National Guard, will continue
his course of lectures to Company & dur
ing the fall and winter. His practical
talks upon first aid to the injured as given
to the soldiers last spring are of incal
culable benefit to every guardsmen.
Sergeant Bodkiu and Corporal Doyle
will return from their mountain trip
within a few days.
SANTA ANA, Cal., Aug. 29.â Company
L, SeventÃ Regiment, of this city indulged
in its first court-martial Thursday niaht,
when Private Myron Holderman was
called upon to defend himself against the
charges of habitually absenting himself
from drills, disobeying orders by refusing
to report at the armory and refusing to
furnish an excuse for non-attendance at
drills. The proceedings were conducted
by Major D. R. Weller of Los Angeles as
judge advocate.
In order to facilitate matters Holderman
pleaded not g uilty to the charges as a
Cantain Finley swore the charges as pre
sented were true. Sergeant Dean John
ston introduced tueconipanv's roll-book to
prove that the defeudant had been absant
from drills on the dates specified. The
defendant testified that be had presented
excuses for non-attendance, and had been
under the impression that no fault could
be found with his punctuality as long as
he maintained an average of 60 per cent
on attendance, which theory was drastically
exploded.
The evidence in the cane will be sub

be accompanied by a recommendation from
Major Weller as to tbe punishment he

Second Brigade.
The election in Company H, First In
fantry, took place Jast Monday evening.
The newly elected lieutenants are Mr.
Judge, first, and Mr. Davis, second lieu
tenant. For a time it seemed that the
order from brigade headquarters would
not be carried out for lack of an officer
to preside at the election.
In regimental orders No. 17 Colonel Wil
liam Macdonald compliments Captain Fil
mer on the very successful camp held by
Company Bat Los Gatos. The discipline
maintained and the promptness in send
ins report* were especially commended.
Captain Edward Fitzpatrick's company,

marched from this City to Alviso recently
and then came home by steamer.
Mlijor Boston's first battalion, First In

BAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 28.â Interest In
target-shooting in San Jose s<ems to be
reopening. The following challenge ap
peared inthe San Jose Mercury Tuesday,
and no doubt the marksmen of San Jose
will be treated to a good, spicy match
some time in the near future:
San Jose, Cal., Aug. 20, 1896.
Edward Hubback, a ninrVsman of no small
ability, who is a member of the Sciiuetzen
Section of the San Jose Turn Verein, is now
wearing the championship medal of the above -
mentioned club, an honor which belongs else
where lor the good and sufficient reason that
another marksman who is in the champion
class made a score above tbe limit to quali.y,
which was placed at 400 rings, but who, on ac
count of his not wearing: a gray and green coat
at the time of making said score, was disquali
fied from being awarded the medal, and th 3
same was taken by Mr. Uubback, whusa score
was far below the 400 rings.
Now, believing that a true sportsman would
not and should not wear honors won by a com
rade, I hen-by challenge said Uubback to shoot
a match of 100 shots each at the German ring
target for $50 aside for the championship of
Santa Clara County, the winner to be open to
challenge by any bona-flae resident of Santa
Clara County under sume conditions.
Accompanying this is a certified check for
above amount, and if said Hubback does not
accept this challenge accompanied by a simi
lar check or its equivalent within one week,
the public may justly deem him unworthy of
wearing championship medals. Respectfully
submitted, A. M. Barkek.
Hubback is a sergeant of Company B,
Fifth Infantry, and is the crack shot of
the company, beintr the only man in the
champion class. He wears many hand
some medals and takes an active part iv
all prize shoots and other matches.
Dr. Barker is a prominent dentist of San
Jose and has always been an enthusiastic
rifleman. He is Known to be one of the
heet nhotsin Santa Clara County and is al
ways reliable in a match. He holds nu
merous trophies and generally participates
in the shooting festivals against many of
the cracks of San Francisco.
Sergeant Hubback holds the champion
medal of Company B and also the cham
pion medal of the shooting section of the
San Jose Turn Verein. In Company Bhe
shoots the regulation Springfield rifle, the
trigger of which must pull six pounds or
over. In matches with his comrades of
the Schuetzen Verein Hubback uses a
Winchester rifle with hair trigger. Hub
beck s friends think that if he confines
himself to either one of tbe two rifles and
gets into good shape be can make it hot
for any other rifleman In Santa Clara
County, and they are willing to back him
in a match. I)r. Barker shoots a Win
chester with hair trigger.
The marksmen of Santa Clara County
are eager to see a match oetween these two
cracks, and at the shooting festival of the
Sch'.etzen Verein it is expected that both
will take part.
Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 28.-T.he
signal corps of the Third Brigade are still
doing good work. Tuesday night was
devotea to night sienaling with good suc
cess. Station A was established on top of
the armory in command of Sergeant At
water and Station B, under command of
Sergeant Martin, was stationed on top of
the Capitol. Messages were sent and re
ceived with great success. Next Sunday
will be devoted to target practice, as the
corps' semi-annual shoot takes place next
month. Corporal Watkina of the corps is
â¢till in the southern portion of the State.
Sergeant Bailey is away on his summer
outinor. Sergeant Atwater, who has re
turned from his vacation, reports that he
made the trip to Los Angeles on his bicy
cle. Privates Harris and McCurdy, new
members, are rapidly becoming helograph
experts and Warren and Taylor are doing
great work with the flags. The corps is
making preparations for mounted field
drill, which takes place soon.
Troop B left for Folsom at 9 o'clock last
Saturday night They went in light
marching order and on a strictly practice
march, carrying no tents, but cooking
utensils and regulation rations. The
march was supervised by the State mili
tary officials to ascertain how success. ully
the cavalry command can carry out a
practice march. The troop will probably
make a trip to Marysville within two
weeks.
Company E, Second Infantry, tendered
a laaies' night this week, and a very pleas
ing programme was presented for tie en
tertainment of tbe guest?, who were wel
comed by Captain Schomaker. Alter
music by the band they were addressed by
Colonel Guthrie. A bayonet drill by a
picked squad of company members fol
lowed.
Company G, Second Infantry, turned
out over sixty strong at drill this week.
They claim the supremacy at drill and
Company E at the butts. Ex-Captain Runs
taller has offered a handsome fioid medal
for the best individual score in fifty shots,
to be competed for on the first Sunday in
September by members of Companies E
and G. Jt has long been a mooted ques
tion as to whether Company C of Marys
ville or Company E of this city possesses
the best shots, each claiming that honor, so
an endeavor is being made to have a com
petitive match between twenty men on a
side to decide supremacy. This will come
off in the near future, ten men coming
from Marysville to this city and ten men
going to that place. The match is to be
held simultaneously.
Ei-Colonel Park Henshaw and Colonel
Guthrie sat as an examining board in the
cases of the elected officers, Captain Cook
of Troop B and Lieutenant Martin oKthe
Signal Corps and others, all of whom
passed a successful examination.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., Aug. 28.â The
placing of a 500-yard target before the
winter setson sets in is the item in which
the members of the local military com
pany are most interested these days. T:ie
officers of the regular army, who visited
Company D, Second Infantry, recently
and investigated its workings, impressed
upon the members the necessity for prac
tice at a greater distance than 200 yards,
and their words were not wasted. The
proposition was one to which Marysviile's
riflemen had hitherto given considerable
thought, and now the prospects are that
the project will meet a happy consumma
tion.
Next in importance is the second State
shoot for tbe year 1896, to take place some
day in September, the exact date to be an
nounced from regimental headquarters.
As a result of tbe first shoot of the year,
held last June, Marysville has nineteen
prospective sharpshooters, i. c., citizen
soldiers who stand good chances of reach
ing tbe necessary 90 per cent next month,
thereby securing the gold bar and title of
sharpshooter. As riflemen it is quite
probable that nearly thirty of D's mem
bers will qualify and wear the silver bar.
The guardsmen north of Sacramento,
for three years past, have won the Gov
ernor's gold and silver medals offered for
sharDshooters, and although Marysville
has never been so fortunate as to secure
one of the beautiful trophies, her soldier
boys who enter the contest in the spring
of '97 will force their competitors to shoot
well up to insure them the laurels.
At present there is but one vacancy in
the ranks of Company D, and that was
occasioned by the death of her bugler, O.
F. Stoodley, which occurred several
months ago.
MERCED, Cal., Aujr. 28.â Company A,
Sixth Infantry, has accepted an invita
tion extended by, the pastor of Bethel
Methodist Episcopal Church South, and
will attend divine services at that church
Sunday evening, August 30. The com
pany will follow the example set by many
other companies in the United States and
attend special services in a boJy at least
onre a year.
Two recruits were received at the Mon
day night drill and two applications are to
be balloted upon at the next meeting.
Several other civilians are contemplating
joining and the prospects seem very fav
orable to quite an increase in the member
ship of the company. An addeJ interest
is noticeable among the men and it is ex
tending to citizens not members.
A movement is on foot to attempt to
establish a cadet corps among the boys of
the. County High School which will open
this fall. The company is heartily in
accord with the proposition and will
assist every way in its power.
A SENSATIONAL STORY.
Judge Conlan Denies Having Received
Notes Threatening to Mow
His House Up.
Jndge Conlan was surprised and an
noyed when he read in an evening paper
on Saturday a sensational story of having
received letters threatening to blow his
house up with dynamite, and that his
wife W0.3 so prostrated with terror that
private detectives had been employed to
watch his house.
"It is a case, of much ado about noth
ing," said the Judge, when seen about
the story. "It is true I received some two
weeks asro a postal card from a criminal,
as I supposed, who had possibly been in
my court, abusing me in filthy language.
There was no mention of dynamite in it;
it was simply a filthy note.
"Two years ago, before the election, I
received a similar note in the same hand
writing and I placed the matter in the
hands of the postal authorities. 1 have an
idea of who the writer is, but cannot
prove it. Every public official is liable to
receive similar epi3tles about this time,
and it is a pity such things should get
publicity. I met my wife Saturday after
noon at'Lotta'B fountain, fche had a copy
of the paper in her hand and was more
amused than angry at the aosurdly sensa
tional story." #
Christian Evidence.
Rev. William H. Moreland preached to a
large congregation in St. Luke's Church yester
day on Christian evidence, and his subject,
"How to Know God," was addressed especially
to agnostics. The text was, "If any man will
do his will he shall know of the doctrine
whether it be of God."
He said: "Some agnostics argue that be
cause they don't know God no one else can.
What they do not Know nobody can know.
Their ignorance is the measure of everyone's
Knowledge. It is impossiDle to argue with
such dense conceit. Other agnostics are open
to conviction. The unbeliever is mistaken.
He is responsible for the degree of faith to
which he has attained. Putting aside the wit
ness of the Bible and the church, the preacner
puts himself beside the skeptic. Would you
know God? Then don't waste time in wrangl
ing controversies. God is truth. Therefore
keep your mind open to receive the truth from
whatever source it comes. "

WILL MEET IN STOCKTON
The Grand Lodge of the I. 0. B.
B. Abides by Its Former
Decision.
Steps Are Being Tak?n for the Organ >
zatou of a Past Presidents'
Association.
Yesterday was a busy day for the offi
cers and members of the Grand Lodge of
the Independent Orderof B'nsi B'rith. A
special session, lasting the greater portion
of the day, dealt with the proposed recon
sideration of the Grand Lodge's former
decision to hold its next annual meeting
in Stockton. A considerable part of the
members seemed to regard this action as
hasty and ill-advised lor various reasons,
contending that the annual meeting
should be held, as hitherto, in this City,
which is the seat of the Grand Lodge.
Petitions to this effect were addressed to
the Grand Lodge by a number of the San
Francisco lodges.
On the other Land, tbe fact that the
Grand Lodge had accepted the invitation
of Hope Lodue of Stockton and decided to
hold its next annual meeting in that city
in January, 1897, seemed in tbe conception
of a larger portion of the members to be
final aud not properly subject to revision.
In opening the meeting Grand Presi
dent Edward I. Wolfe went over the
ground in detail, and urgently recom
mended that there be no revision of the
Grand Lodge's action, since the citizens of
Stockton had already pledged themselves
to give the delegates a most cordial recep
tion. To revoke the acceptance of the hos
pitality thus generously proffered would,
he contended, be a most ungracious act,
and would place the Grand Lodge in an
unfavorable light before the public in gen
eral and the people of Stockton in par
ticular.
Joseph Rothschild made a motion that
the action of the Grand Lodge accepting
the invitation ot Hope Lodge of Stockton
be rescinded.
This motion being seconded set the ball
a rolling. Among the speakers who dis
cussed it were Mr. Rothschild, Joseph
Bien, J. Sham, I. J. Aachheim, J. L.
Franklin, H. Lasser. S. H. Simon, A. L.
Badt, L. Blum, Past Grand Presidents D.
S. Hirshoerg and William Salburg, H.
Watts, I. N. Choynski, Philip Stern, Ed
ward Towsky, L. Ehrlich, Rev. Jacob
Voorsanger, H. Gudstadt and L. Bern
steiu.
G. Samuels asked tbat the motion to re
scind be put to a vote, and it was lost.
Fir^t Grand Vice-President M. P. Stein,
who is also piesident of Hope Lodj;e of
Stockton, made a brief address expressing
his satisfaction at the action of the Grand
Lodge, and promising the delegates a
royal time in Stockton. Grand President
Wolfe congratulated all present upon the
happy termination of the controversy, ana
the meeting ended with a prayer led by
Dr. Voorsanger.
After the Grand Lodge's session a past
presidents' association was formed, with
I. J. Aschheim as president pro tern. and
Wallace Wise as secretary. Edward Tow

been making to advertise the meeting,
had much to do with the large number
present. Chairman Quitzow commented
hopefully on the increased attendance,
and urged those present to see to it that
the meetings continue to prow.
Rev. W. T. Fleenor of Seattle, who has
frequently occupied the platform, was the
speaker of the alternoon. riis topic wat,,
"Is the Papal Church in America Tolerant
and Patriotic?"
As a prelude to his address Mr. Fleenor
remarked on the fact that the record of at
tendance of seventy-five had been broken.
"I feel," he said, "that we are advancing; j
that we are going to advance still more." j
In reference to the press reports of nis j
previous lectures Le said thit he had no !
fault to find with the quality, but he ob- j
jected to the quantity. He didn't like to
be crowcied into a column, but would j
prefer something more comprehensive.
"I have sympathy, but not a biÂ» of pity,"
he saiii, "for the man who when you begin
to analyze his position sets uu the pitiful â 
wail of persecution. lam jriad that every j
department oi this Governr.ient is opÂ°n
to public inspection and 1 am in favor of
every institution that makes a pretense at
doing business with this Republic being
open to public inspection* We are right
ing principles, not individuals, save as
they hold ideas and havi- practices that
are dimetrically opposed to the principles
of this country. Sometimes in eradicat
ing an evil it is necessary to remove an
agent.
"I would not refer to the person who oc
cupied this platform last Monday in lit if j
he had not said in his next lecture he .
would attend to my case.
''Wasn't that a wondeiful fusion of Jews !
and Romans lasi Monday nignt? It car- i
ried one back to tne time when the Jews !
and tne Romans Dulled to crucify our j
ISavior. Yorke >ays Fleenor lias come ali i
ihe way from Seaitie to save Ban Fran- j
Cisco from tne Ji suits ami the Pope. God |
knows they need it. He tooK occasion to j
say that '.he man who stands at tue head j
of the American Protective Association
was a man whose name is unlit to be men
tioned in decent society. This whole
thing is a libel of Rome and the devil. I
am not here to indorse any man, but I
wunt to say that Mr. Hudelson is an ac
credited minister of his denomination. I !
want, to say further that he has been in
dorsed by the Baptist Ministers' Associa
tion. Tins means tnat he has the virtual
endorsement of the enure denomination I
in the country, comprising over 4,ikjo,ouO |
of the best citizens of the world. Tim j
whole matter wa^ gotten up, not to smite
Mr. Hndeison, but to brins: down the
cudgel up >n tne head of every American
in this country and upon the head of
every member of this society."
Mr. Fleenor criticized the statements of
Father Yorke in regard to tne marriage of
Protestants. Tue speaker said that ihe
churcn oi Rome regarded such marriages
as legal, because they could not mtenere
with American law, but claimed that the
church did not consider them binding ac
cording to ecclesiastical law. He said that
Father Yorke in his efforts to cite ca
nonical iaw referred to no books, but
caileu upon the people to take his unsup
ported word.
The whoie spirit and history of the
Catholic church, he claimed, was opposed
to the i.ea that it wa-s tolerant and
patriotic. The church, lie declared, was
a limitless monarchy, and as such could
not logically indorse American instiiu- |
tions. Quotations from papal letters were
read, ana extracts from Louis Jouin's
"Evidences of Religion" were cited exten
sively in support of these contentions.
The speaker concluded with an admoni
tion to the audience to stand by ibeir
country and the principle? of the Ameri
can Protective Associa ion.

Sawdust is turned into transportable
fuel in Germany by a very simple process.
It is heated under high steam pressure
until the resinous ingredients become
sticky, when it is pressed inlo bricks. One
man with a two horsepower machine can
turn out 9000 bricks a day.

Solid Oaklanders Declare
That Reputation Is
of Value.
NOT FRIENDLY TO LIBEL
A Thousand Dollars! Offered to
Find a Flaw in ths Fee
Bill.
constables: ask sympathy.
If Not Paid More for Catching Tramps
They Will Have to Work to
Avoid Arrest Themselves.
Oakland Office Sak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 30. f
Oaklanders have at last found an idea
upon which they can all unite. They
have discovered what Shakespeare pro
claimed to the world quite a long time
ago â that a good name is not trash and is
worth protecting and preserving. Twice
â within the past month influential police
court juries have convicted a man of
criminal libel because he unjustly held a
leading citizen up to the community as a
being to be shunned and not to be trusted.
The principals in the case were really
only of secondary importance, the great
principle Involved being the value of a
character, and whether anybody who can
obtain a press and type should be per
mitted to assail it as his fancy or his ad
vertising solicitor dictates. Twelve men
of family and weight, and who themselves
have nothing to fear from such attacks in
a community where they are so well
known, have decided that such condnct
shall not be permitted, and on two occa
sions have decided that the offender is
guilty.
This is a refreshing change from the
ordinary tactics of police court juries, and
has served to restore confidence in the
community to such a degree that when a
third suit was brought against the same
paper it had no legal owner or no one who
would acknowledge that they owned it,
and it will be difficult to fix the responsi
bility. At one of the trials it was openly
stated in court that if a jury would not
protect a man who was maliciously called
a thief, there was no recourse but to adopt
the border fashion of settling differences
with a gun. Such a course is not neces
sary, and it will be years before the salu
tary lesson just taught will be forgotten.
Another fact in this connection which is
creditable to Oakland's intelligence is that
such tactics are not acceptable .to enough
people to pay for the expense of circu
lating it, and thus it happens that any
body who is courageous enough to accept
the "good-will" of Oakland's oldest news
paper can have it by paying junk-store
prices for its pi and type.
The constables who depend for their
daily bread upon the misfortunes of their
fellow men have expressed a desire for
the sympathy of the community in their
present dilemma. They claim that the
fee bill passed by the last Legislature is
making paupers of them and gradually
paving for them the way to find rest in
the potter's field. Further than this, the
constables have offered to guarantee $1000
to an attorney who can find a flaw in the
bilL
The work of catching men who are pass
ine through the county on their endless
mission for work is not regarded at all
favorably in Alameda County. There
have been so many flagrant cases of in
justice that the sympathy is with the
"tramp" rather than with his catcher.
So many tricks have been resorted to by
which men have been convicted as va
grants that with few exceptions the so
cfaeil constabulary of the county is not
accorded much sympathy in its present
fight. Judging from the number of "ap
pointments" and "revocations" of depu
ties filed by the constables and the reasons
given for taking back the star, it is evi
dent that but for the temporary appoint
ment there would be no difference be
tween the "officer" and the so-called
tramp. When it is considered that a
constable can make as many deputies as
he pleases, and that having done a little
â¢work on election day is ofttimes the only
claim upon which the privilege is based,
the extent of the evil is at once manifest.
To expect the county to let every political
worker make a good living without work
ing is an idea not very popular at this
time. To nse the words of the head con
stable of one of the townships, "There are
men with a star scouring the county for
tramps who would be just as liable to ar
rest but for their appointments."
There are, of course, a few others.
It is fully believed that the State board
will raise the total assessment of Alameda
County, not because they think it is now
too low, as it is higher than last year, but
because the politics of Assessor Dal ton does
not agree with the ideas of the men who
failed to recognize the existence of a Hun
dred miles of railroad track that Mr. Dal
ton found in Alameda County. In -the
proceedings at Sacramento it is very easy
to see the hidden hand that is seeking to
cast obloquy on the work of Dalton. It is
the work of the mortgage-holders and
â  bankers, who for the first time have been
required to pay taxes on something near
the correct amount of their holdings.
If every boxcar and piece of property be
ionging to the railroad company were to
be assessed for as large a proportion of its
value as is the little house of the working
man a levy one-third less than the present
tax would be sufficient. But it is not for
such "equalization" that Mr. Black Ryan
attends the meetings of the county and
State boards. A peculiarity of the situa
tion is that some of the men who are at
tempting to discredit Dalton because of
their low personal assessments are the
same who object to bis assessment of their
realty. Anywhere else such proceeciinus
might cause comment, but not in Aiame
da County. S. W. B.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 31, 1896.
REOPENING OF
ASBURY CHURCH.
Has Been Thoroughly
Renovated Despite the
Hard Times.
STARTS A NEW CAREER
Methodist Polity Outlined by
Editor Wilson of the
Pacific Advocate.
THIKTEEN YEARS OF SUCCESS.
Has Secured the Next Annual Con
ference to be Conducted by Bishop
Hargrove of Tennessee.
Oakland Office San Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 30. J
Asbury M. E. Church South was re
opened to-day after several months spent
in repairing, painting and renewing.
Rev. H. M. McKnight prepared a special
programme and when the congregation
entered the beautiful auditorium they
hardly recognized their old place of wor
ship.
By an appropriation of a few hundred
dollars for repairs, the congregation was
stimulated to greatly increase the amount
beyond what was considered possible dur
ing these unsettled times. Rev. H. C.
Christian, presiding elder of San Fran
cisco district, preached in the morning.
Rev. R. P. Wilson, D.D., editor of the
Pacific Methodist Advocate, preached in
the evening. A select chorus choir ren
dered choice music.
During the discourses it was learned
the congregation has not had to contend
with difficulties common to churches in
the West, but it has had some peculiar
tests of strength, through which it has
come tiiumphantly.
Some important issues have made this
point a storm center, but clouds are dis
persed and the valiant heroes rejoice in
hope and zeal, while the Christians of
other branches of the family rejoice with
them. Recruits are coming in and the fu
ture is promising. One point in the prac
tical Christianity of this noble band is to
owe no man anything but to love one
another.
Asbury M. E. Church South was named
in honor of Francis Asbury, the first man
ever made bishop in the Methodist Church.
Asbury congregation is a part of the
Methodist Episcopal Church South, one
of the greatest branches of the Methodist
family in the world, second only in Amer
ica to her twin sister, the M. F Church.
The M. E. Church South now numbers
more than a million and a half member
ship, conducting a strong foreign mission
ary society, doing successful work around
the globe. In the United States her work
is almost entirely south of the Ohio and
west of the Mississippi rivers. The word
"south" in the name indicates a geo
graphical and not a political distinction to
those familiar with Methodist history.
The separation of the great Methodist
church in 1844 into two independent
ecclesiastical bodies was deemed a wise
and amicable solution of a vexed question
thrust upon the church by zealous poli
ticians. By this plan of separation,
adopted by the general conference, a
secession of the great New England con
ferences was probably averted. No two
branches of the Christian church are so
fraternal as the Methodist bodies â holding
doctrines identical, differing only in
church government.
Asbury Church was organized in 1882
whh a very small charter list, Rev. Will
Layson being the first pastor. He was
succeeded after one year by Rev. J. C.
Simmons. Having no church building,
service was held in a hired hall.
Dr. Simmons remained one year and
was succeeded by Rev. Samuel Brown,
who remained three years and did much
material work. During his pastorate the
present commodious edifice of worship
was purchased. Rev. Will Layson was
pastor for onÂ« year after Dr. Brown. He
was succeeded by Rev. C. O. Steele, who
remained one year.
The next pastor was Rev. T. A. Atkin
son, who served for two years. He was
followed by Rev. R. Boyns in October,
1889, who served until his sudden death,
April 8, 1891, leaving the church for seve
ral months without a pastor.
Rev. J. R. Compton was appointed in
August to fill out the term, and acted as
pastor until October, 1891, when Rev. A.
C. Bane was appointed and served two
years. He was succeeded in October, 1893,
by T. H. B. Anderson, D.D., who was fol
lowed by Rev. George Baugb. Rev. H.
M. McKnight, the present pastor, was ap
pointed in October, 1895, to succeed Mr.
Baugh.
Asbury Church has secured the next
sitting of Pacific annual conference, which
will convene October 7, 1896, Bishop R. K.
Hargrove, D.D., presiding. Bishop Har
grove is president of the board of trustees
of VanderbUt University. He and Mrs.
Hargrove are now loosing after the in
terests of the church in the Northwest.
BLUEROCK SHOOTING.
Monthly Contest of the Pacific Coast
Tournament Association,
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. SO.â The Pacific
Coast Tournament Association's novelty
shoot held on its grounds at Alameda
Point yesterday brought together the
crack shots around the bay, and a good
day's amusement was afforded. T. R.
Barney's invention was used for the first
time to-day and pioved an undoubted suc
cess. It is known as a tangle-shot pull,
and insures unknown traps and unknown
angles. Three series of traps, three in
each, are controlled by the pull, and the
operator of the lever has no knowledge of
either angle or trap that he is going to
give the shooter.
Mr. Barney is a member of the associa
tion and was warmly congratulated on his
ingenuity.
The first event was the "expert event,"
unknown angles, tangle-shot trap pull, at
100 birds. The scores made were:

Cntchan 80, Carr 73, Daniels 82, Lake 71,
Wagner 61, Thorn 67, Sears 71, Murdock7B,
Leeds 58, Young 70, Whitney 83.
As the club failed to qualify for the
team event at doubles, it was replaced
with a 15-pair shoot with $1 50 entrance.
Webb won first money, scoring %. 0.
Feudner second with 25 and Daniels third
with 22. The scores in totals were: Rob
ertson 21, Haight 21, Webb 26. O. Feudner
25, Nanman 19, Foster 19, Bruns 11, Wag
ner 15, Daniels 22, Barney 20.
In the 15-singles pool, $1 entrance, F.
Feudner won first, breaking 15 straight,
Whitney and O. Feuduer tied for second
and Robertson and Vernon tied for third.
Following were the scores: 0. Feudner

The last match was the gold medal nov
ice match at 50 oirds, all straight away for
those who had never broken 10 consecu
tive bluerocks, the medal to be won twice
before becoming property of contestant.
The medal was won by H. Betten of the

YOUNG MEN'S INSTITUTE
The First Lecture Under the Auspices
of the New Lecture
Bureau.
Under recent legislation the Young
Men's Institute has established a perma
nent central lecture bureau, under whose
supervision the subordinate councils of
the Pacific Coast jurisdiction must hold
free public lectures and distribute litera
ture. The following named have been ap
pointed as members of the bureau: Rev.
Peter C. Yorke, Rev. James McDonald,
Hon. J. F. Sullivan, Colonel James F.
Smith, Frank J. Kierce, James E. O'Don
nell, John Lynch and Thomas H. Fallon.
The bureau was formally organized several
weeks ago by the election of Rev. Father
Yorke as president, John E. Richards Jr.
as secretary and John O'Donneli as treas
urer.
Local bureaus have been established at
Los Angeles, Sacramento and Virginia
City. The Los Angeles bureau is pre
sided over by Right Rev. Bishop Mont
gomery, the one at Sacramento by Right
Rev. Bishop Grave and the one at Vir
ginia City by Rev. Father Taubman.
In accordance with the rules adopted by
the Grand Council each subordinate coun
cil is required to give at least one free pub
lic lecture each year under the direction of
the central bureau. The first of the series
will be delivered at Metropolitan Temple
on the evening of September 9 under the
auspices of Pioneer Council No. 1. Most
Rev. Archbishop Riordan will be the lec
turer, and his theme will be "Individual
and Political Liberty." He is widely
Known as an able and eloquent speaker.
The lectures will be free to the public,
but no person will be admitted without a
ticket. Tickets may be obtained from the
members of Pioneer Council or of the sec
retary of the central bureau, John E.
Richards Jr., whose office is in the Parrott
building. It is not intended to confine
the lectures to strictly Catholic subjects,
but non-Catholica will be asked to attend
these lectures.
REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
Inquiry for Both City and Coun
try Property Reported
Better.
AUGUST BUILDING BECORD.
The Various Changes in Van Ness
Avenue Daring the Past
Decade.
There was some improvement last week
in the inquiry, but the demand continues
to be mainly for small properties and
they are being sought for as a role for in
vestment purposes. The prevailing low
prices should be a sufficient incentive to
create a fairly active market, but for a
variety of reasons it apparently does not.
At some day in the not very far distant
future many dwellers in San Francisco
will recall the present time with feelings
of regret not unmixed with disgust and
will, to use a slang expression, feel like
kicking themselves for not taking advan
tage of the many golden opportunities
for profitable investments In real estate that
can be found now in aU irts of the City.
The inquiry for country lands is if anything
better than for City property and it is seldom
that the various firms having country depart
ments do not report sales for good prices of
desirable fruit and farm land.

more rapid changes that take place in the de
velopment of new residence districts. These
changes are as marked in regard to direction
as are the future districts for choice dwelling
sites. This is best evidenced by the changes
that have and are taking place on Van Ness
avenue. It was first devoted solely to
first-class residences, then prominent
churches were built on the avenue,
which was followed by the erection
of handsome hotels north of Turk street;
while south of Turk street is destined to be
the location in the near future of first-class re
tail business establishments. There is now in
coarse oi construction a business block at the
northwest corner of Van Ness avenue and
Fulton street, which, with the stores already
in this vicinity, will give this portion of the
avenue quite a business appearance; and if
the vacant land lying near Market street was
suitably improved it would only be a short
time until large retail establishments would
be located there, for Van Ness avenue is to
San Francisco what Twenty-third street is to
New York.
PRESIDIO PROMOTIONS,
Change of Station Not In
volved by the Advance
ment.
Equipment for Three of the Ten-
Inch Disappearing
Guns.
There is money now available for work
on the harbor defenses of San Francisco,
but very little activity is shown at pres
ent. Word comes from the East that an
other twelve-inch breech-loading rifle has
been finished. It will soon be tested and
sent across the continent by rail.
Some progress has been made recently
toward the completion of the ten-inch dis
appearing batteries on the bluff near Fort
Point. The equipment for three of the
guns is on the ground.
Experiments at the twelve-inch rifles
near Fort Point have shown that the plat
form space for loading is not sufficient,
hence an extension is being made.
The managers of the powder company
at Santa Cruz are still experimenting,
with the confident belief that powder fully
up to the requirements of the department
will soon be produced. The authorities at
Washington are exceedingly anxious that
a powder plant on the Pacific shall attain
the success desired.
A board for the examination of gunners
will be convened at the Presidio in Sep
tember. Excellent progress has been made
during the past year in artillery practice,
hence the annual examination is awaited
with more than ordinary attention.
Captain Henry J. Reilly now commands
Light Battery F, Fifth Artillery. The as
signment under the rule is for a period of
four years. He came over from Alcatraz
last Thursday, and is now on duty at the
Presidio. Captain Morris has gone to
Alcatraz to command Battery K.
Captain Reilly is a veteran officer in the
artillery service. He served on the gun
boat Benton at Vicksburg in 1863 and
participated in ail the notable engage
ments in the Mississippi River in which
Admiral Porter's fleet was engaged. The
Benton had a remarkable history as a
fighter.
Lieutenant Charlea E. Treat,'|Battery E,
Fifth Artillery, has been detailed as ad
jutant of the Light Artillery Battalion at
Fort Riley, Kans. Major Randolph, the
commander, was authorized to select a
capable officer, and he designated Lieu
tenant Treat. While the assignment is
not a promotion, it is a high compliment
to Mr. Treat's special ability as an officer
of artillery.
There were two promotions at the Pre
sidio this week, and, fortunately for the
officers promoted change of station is not
involved. First Lieutenant Oliver E.
Wood, Battery C, Fifth Artillery, is pro
moted to captain, and Second Lieutenant
William G. Haan is promoted to be first
lieutenant.
First Lieutenant P. C. March will leave
for a two years' course at the Fort Monroe
Artillery School.
Captain Frank Thorp, Light Battery D,
has been on the sick list for several days.

DON'T WORK ON SUNDAY
Rev. On Birch Calls Upon the Trades
Unions to Protest
Against It.
The Rev. Dr. Birch preached at the
First Christian Church, Twelfth street, on
the "Sinner's Friend." He said every one
needed a supernatural friend. At election
times the workingman had many ap
parently fervent sympathizers, but when
their need of him had passed their friend*
ship departed like a dog from a picked
bone and their "dear friend, the working
man," might go anywhere for all they
cared. In the time of failure, poverty or
glaring sin into which he might fall where
could either the rich or the poor man or
woman find a friend to hold their hand,
sayings "I am touched with your sorrow
or grieve over your sin as God is touched
and grieved for me"? Were the churches
preaching creed rather than manifesting
Christ?
If the latter, then, as a human object
lesson of God, there would not be 300 or
400 broken-hearted suicides in this City
every year. No honest widow need keep
in her house on Sunday because her gar
ments were not sufficiently decent for
"God's nouse."
It was painful to see workingmen toil
ing in the dirt of a building on a Sunday,
and he appealed to the trades unions to
stand up against it. He advocated that
the building and iron trades should ce<tse
weekly work on Saturday at noon, since
this was done in many, if not all, the big
towns of England and Scotland.

FUN FOR THE RED ROCKS
Annual Outing of the Popular
Cyclers and Their Many
Friends.
An Interesting Programme, Incnding
a Cake Walk, at Wildwood
Park, Sausalita
Under the spreading oaks of Wildwood
Park, Sausalito, the members of the Red
Rock Cyclers' Club and friends enjoyed
their annual outing yesterday. Dancing
to the spirited music of Samuels' band
was the first event on the programme of
the day's festivities. As a floor director
M. Lynch has few equals, and therefore
the success of that part of the entertain
ment was assured in advance.
During an intermission an adjournment
was taken to the track to witness a race of
100 yards between Officer Harrison and
Henry Hart. The contest was unusually
exciting and was won by the Senator in
11 seconds. Harrison made a gallant
struggle, but was beaten by less than a
yard.
After luncheon, which was prepared
under the direction of Miss Dorothy Ross
more and Mrs. Rome Harris, Captain
Rome Harris and William Driscoll gave
an exhibition of fancy ridin?. Honors
were equally divided until Mr. Driscoll, in
making a sharp turn, fell and dislocated
his right shoulder.
Dancing was indulged in for nearly an
hour, when the floor was cleared for the
prize contest, which was won by Mme.
Schiller and Professor Feeney.
Then came the event of the day, a cake
waik, in which the genial Ross Jackson
officiated as judge. So graceful was all the
participants that Judge Jackson was at
first unable to render a decision. There
fore, the couples were obliged to repeat
the performance, and honors were tt:en
awarded as appended; First prize, Pro
fessor Feeney ; second. J. Lindon; third,
Mr. KlonbacK: fourth, Mr. Loch tan.
Grabbag and other games in which
prizes were drawn completed the amuse
ments of the most successful outing of the
popular club.

DELMS DENIES
THERE IS A ROW,
Not a Party to Any Legal
Scandal in the Lux
Case.
GOES OVER THE STORY.
Says Campbell Hastily Assured
Him of His Friend
ship.
GERMAN HEIRS "HAD A KICK.'
Ridicules the Chronicle Story of the
Affidavit as False on
Its Face.
D. M. Delmas indignantly denies tnat
there is a great legal s-candal brewing for
himself and James H. Campbell of San
Jose as rival attorneys for the Lux heirs.
When seen last night he said regarding
his knowledge of the affair and his rela
tions with the interesting case:
In the iirst place, no row is pending between
James H. Campbell of tian Jose aud myself.
In order to understand the nature of the pro
ceeding now pending in Redwood it will be
necessary briefly to review the history of the
Lux litigation an<l the connection of James H.
Campbell with It. In March, 1887, Charles
Lux died, leaving a will by which half of his
property passed in equal shares to his widow,,
Miranda W. Lux, and the remaining half, in
practically equal parts, to his five brothers and
sisters or their children.
John Reynolds, tben a practicing attorney
and now Judge of the Superior Court of Santa
e!Â«rn. County, was appointed by the court at
Redwood Â«u> tne attorney for absent and minor
heirs. This included his representation of
four of the five brothers and sis:cn> if Cuarles
Lux. He continued to represent them from
March or April, 1887, until Jenuary 6, 1888,
w hen Henry Lux of san Josl- was appointed
the attorney in fact for the absent heirs.
As attorney in fact Henry Lux then made a
contract with James H. Campbell, whereby
he was to ac. as the attorney tor and fight tne
lega! battles of the German heirs, that is, the
brothers and sisters of Charles Lux. At the
termination of the litigation Mr. Campbell
vi, to have received 3 per cent of what the
Gorman heirs recovered. From January. 1888,
until July, lrfOO. a period of two and a half
years, Mr. Campbell acted without present
compensation.
The contract was modified on July 14, 1890,
under the terms of which modification the
German heirs conveyed :o Mr. Cam pbeil 3-100
of. tbeir share in the estate, with the under
standing that every allowance made to him by
the court should be deducted from and cred
ited upon the 3 per cent. .Under this contract
an order was made, with the consent of the
German heirs, allowing Mr. Campbell $12,000
b year, to be paid in quarterly installments by
the executors of Charles Lux, and the order
was made retroactive, so that he should receive.
Ibis $1000 a month from the time of bis first
em pi' yment.
Under this order and contract the German
heirs claim that Mr. Campbell has received
$93,000. He admits having received $88,000.
the difference being moneys that he received
under the contract from the sale oi the Buri
Buri ranch.
When dissension arose between the German
heirs aud Jesse S. Potter as executor, Potter
refused to make any further payments to Mr.
Campbell. Pending that litigation a special
administrator was appointed nnd during ten
and a half months Mr. Campbell received
nothing. He claimed that ior this period he
was due $10,500 iiud sought to nave an order
made by the court allowing him this sum.
The German heirs claim that uad'jr his con
tract with them he was not entitled to more
than 3 per cent of what they would receive
under any conditions, and that the $93,000 he
had receiverl was equnl to or in excess oi the
3 per cent to whicn he was entitled. He con
tended that the $93,000 plus the $10,500
which he was then seeking to obtain would
fall short of the 3 per cent, and further
that the payments nmde under the order of
allowance were independent of the 3 per cent
provided for in his comract with the heirs.
Lring tnus wide apart as to the construction
of his con tract the German heirs were lorced
to present the matter to the court for its de
termination.
I had been employed by the German heirs
as counsel for them in all of these matters
under a separate contract which was drawn by
Mr. Campueil himseli. When they came to
me directing thut I should present Mr. Camp
bell's contract and the questions arising under
it to the court 1 bad uo option in the matter,
but before the petition was filed in response to
a letter from Mr. Campbell I wrote to him
fully in regard to the matter on July 29, 1896.
Tbe petition was tiled by the German heirs on
August 8.
In the answer filed by Mr. Campbell it was
alleged that the proceeding had been insti
gated to further the interests of Thomas
B. Bishop to revenge himself upon some acts of
Mr. Campbell in other matters. Oi this 1 have
absolutely no knowledge. The proceeding was
trought upon the written direction of Mr.
CamDbell's own clients and mine.
On August 27 when the matter carce up for
hearing before Judge Buck at Redwood I
stated that I resented the imputations con
tained in that answer to the effect that Mr.
Campbell's clients, or I as their attorney, were
inflenced by Mr. Bishop. Mr, Campbell was
not present in court, but yesterday I received
from him a personal letter, written entirely by
himself, dated August 28, and couched in the
most friendly terms, in which he k taxed that
my remarks had been reported to him aud
that he felt deeply regretted that any thing con
tained in his answer should have given rise to
them, that there was nothing in tbe matter
pending before the court that should cause the
the least personal feeling, and that nothing
had been further from his intention than to
impute in any way that I had been moved In
the matter except under my auty to our mu
tual ciienu.
As to the story contained In the Chronicle
this morning that I was attempting to pre
vent the filing of any affidavit by Mr. Camp
bell, I can only say th*t its absurdity is ap
parent upon its face. 1 could not prevent the
filing of an affidavit by any one. All that one
need do is to present the affidavit to the clerk
of the court and tender him the trifling fee
and it must be filed. As to the truth o: the
statement contained in that affidavit as re
ported I know absolutely nothing. I had
never beard of any of the arrangements
spoken of in the affidavits until the Chronicle
was banded to me this afternoon. I was
never consulted in any such matter.
I am iniormed to-night that James H.
Campbell, who, ii was reported, made the
affidavit, denied ever having done so, or ever
having such an affidavit made or his name
connected with any such statement, and also
that it is absolutely untrue. I sincerely hope
that my information ou this point is correct.

ABOUT MUSIC.
Rev. William liader on Its History
and Origin.
At the evening service in the Third Con
gregational Churcn last evening Rev.
William Rader spoke on music, and said
music antedates man. It began with
creation. Thousands of years before
Pythagoras dreamed of harmony ths reeds
and forest trees and were a part of
nature's orchestra.
The highlanders, with a true reverence
for this melody, laid their dying under
the stars, that they might catch this flood
of natural music. This simple custom
contradicts Mr. Hawies' claim that
"music is the creation of mau."
The patriotism of men has been esti
mated by music. The "Marseilles" thrilled
all France, and "America" and ''Yankee
Doodle" have become the language of our
Nation. When Jenny Lind sane the
"Star-Spangled Banner" in Washington
Daniel Webster arose and joined in the
immortal hymy until bis wife pulled him
back into his seat.
The Christian faith has been preached
by the ministry of music. The oldest
scriptures contain fragments of immortal
hymns. The "P-alter'' is the oldest
by inn book. The "Magnificat" and "Te
j Deum," the doiologies and anthems of
| the early church, remain to us as the ex
pressionsof the deepest life of the soul.

A HIGHBINDER ARRESTED,
Lee Gin's Man Takes a Shot at
Dang Quong, but Misses
His Mark.
Two Highbinder Meeting-Places De
molished by the Police â Fears
of Another War.
Lee Gin, a Chinese highbinder, was
arrested last evening by Sergeants Wool
weber and Anderson, and was detained
at tbe California-street police station on a
charge of assault to murder.
About 6 o'clock last evening, while
Dan^ Quong, a merchant and member of
the Suey Sing Tong, was on his way to his
store, 5 Sullivan alley, he was assaulted by
Lee Gin and two followers. Lee Gin was
heard to say, at the same time pointing
at Dang, "There he is, kill him." With
out warning one of the highbinders drew
his revolver and fired a shot at the
merchant.
The bullet missed, and without waiting
to see tbe effect of the shot the fighting
men disappeared in the crowd.
Sergeants Woolweber and Anderson
were informed and started out to find tbe
highbinders. After a short search they
found lice Gin and placed him under ar
rest. They also discovered that the shoot
ing was the aftermath of a stabbing affray
which occurred in Bartlett alley about a
week ago, in which a Suey Sing Tong man
seriously stabbed a Bo On Tong man.
After receivine this information the
sergeants visited the headquarters of the
Bo On Tong, 1 Brenham place, and
searched tbe building. A number of
knives, revolvers and a large quantity of
cartridges were found, showing that the
society was ready for war. They al&o
found a coat of mail weighing fully fifty
pounds and which would defy the bullets
of even a Chinese highbinder revolver.
After demolishing thi3 place tbe head
quarters of the Suey Sing Tong, 742 Com
mercial street, was visited and laid in
ruins.
The police are confident that a -other
war is brewing in Chinatown, but will do
everything in their power to preserve
order.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 31, 1396.
POLICE ATTACKED
BY SOCIALISTS,
Censured for Interfering
With Labor Party
Meetings.
DEMAND FREE SPEECH.
They Declared the Blue-coated
Guardians .Were the Serv
ants of Capitalists.
WILD EXCITEMENT REIGNED.
Captain Lees and Chief Crowley Also
Made the Victims of Hatred,
Abuse, Etc.
At a meeting of the Socialist Labor
party, held at Pythian Hall last night, the
police were denounced in unmeasured
terms for their interference with the silent
Some of the Lenders of the Socialist
Labor Party Who Were Ar
, rested Saturday Night for Dis
turbing the Peace*
campaign gathering on Saturday night
last, and for the arrest of eight speakers
two weeks ago.
The author of the scathing document,
C. H. Davies, did not mince matters.
There was not even a saving clause in the
entire resolution. From a socialistic
standpoint it was an admirable document,
full of fire from beginning to end, and
reeking with the most courteous abuse the
blue-coated guardians of San Francisco
have ever been called upon to face.
Nor was this all. The heads of the de
partment, Captain Lees and Chief Crow
ley, come in for a large share of individual
criticism, thougn their names were not
mentioned directly in the resolution.
The meeting was called to order by
George Ast)den, chairman of the evening.
Ke said by way of introduction that the
interference of the police was poDably a
good thing for socialism. Such acts would
call attention to the party and the princi
ples for which it was fighting. These same
tactics bad been adopted in other cities
with indifferent success at first and finally
failure.
The audience then sang tbe Marseillaise
with great spirit and earnestness, after
which S. Siler, tbe speaker of the occa
sion, delivered a ringing address on tbe
benefits of socialism. Among other things
he said that socialism had become an
American institution. He said if the
paper which announced yesterday tnat
the men arrested Saturday night could
only look in on the audience they could
see that It was American to tbe backbone.
Siler declared that the Socialistic party
was a party of peace.
"The police are only trying to provoke
uj," he said, "into committing some act
so that they can shoot us down like dogs "
At the conclusion of Mr. Siier's remarks
C. H. Davies gained the floor and asked
permission to read the following resolu
tion:
Whereas, Of late un warranted and igno
minious arrests have been made by a pam
pered and truculent police force: and whereas
it is in evidence that peaceable and law
abiding citizens cannot assemble to voice
their just and honest convictions; and where
as, we are convinced that the basis for
the arrests by our obnoxious and hireling
police force is not as assumedâ disturbing the
peace and quiet of a certain secret societyâ
but is found in the principles enunciated
by the culprits, which are in opposition to
capitalism; and whereas, the boasted liberties
ot the American people are hourly and daily
Imperiled when such an arbitrary act as the
suppression of free speech CHn te successfully
achieved by such an indolent, detestable and
malodorous hoard of ignorant sloths at San
Francisco's police force; and, whereas, the !
virtuous indignation of an honest but indul
gent people should be aroused by tbe efforts of
our insidious and implacable foe â the police
forceâ to further curtail our liberties for
reasons entirely at variance with equity and
justice; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the Socialist Labor party
and its sympathizers and all lovers of liberty,
condemn and denounce in measured bat un
mistakable terms the dastardly and cowardly
actions of the poiice for their arrests of last
night and in the near past; also be it â 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this meeting
that persistent efforts be made and pushed to
a victorious conclusion to sustain our consti
tutional right to indulge whenever and wher
ever we deem it fitting and proper our right of
free speech, and invite all lovers of justice and
fair play in all walk* of life, independent of i
color, sex and creed or party affiliations, to aid
us in our determined efforts to establish that
right; and
Resolved, That we deplore a condition that
necessitates unworthy surveillance of honest
and upright citizens by an ignoble gang ol
brutes masquerading in the guise of conserva
tors of public weal: and be it further
Resolved, That the press of this City be fur
nished with a copy of these resolutions for pub
llcaiion.
Hardly had Davies concluded reading
the resolution when clieer upon cheer was
sent up by the excited audience. Chairman
Aspden quickly submitted the acceptance
or rejection to the people, and only one
man of the 500 present voted against it.
He endeavored to explain his position
by declaring that tiie Poiice Judge who
haa sentenced the Socialists should be
condemned and not the policemen, who
simply carried out the instructions of
their superiors.
VIEWS OF SOCIALISTS.
Participants In Saturday Night's
Silent Meeting Disgusted With
the Authorities.
The Socialists are highly indignant over
the results attending their attempt to hold
an open-air meeting Saturday night.
They declare with much earnestness that
the police are persecuting instead of pro
secuting them. The officers go out of their
way, they say, to antagonize them in their
constitutional right of free speech.
Whether this be true in fact or simply
an assumption based on observation is
not clear, but the developments at the
meeting held yesterday afternoon seem to
verify the position. Socialists to the num
ber of thirty or more had gathered at the
corner of Grant avenue and Market
street. , Hardly had the first speaker,
Charles D. Sunflower, uttered a dozen
words before a great crowd gathered about
the stand. The sidewalk was fairly well
filled, though not sufficiently to hamper
in any way pedestrians. Officer J. M.
Heard was on duty at this particular
point and apparently experienced no
difficulty in Keeping a clear passageway.
When the second speaker, George Speed,
mounted tbe platform it was observed that
Officer Heard was becoming nervous.
Finally he rushed across to a cigar-store
and telephoned to headquarters for in-
structions. Just what instructions were
given is not known, but the officer went
directly to tbe Hammam Baths and, it is
claimed, begged authority to arrest the
speakers. The stand, by the way, had
been placed directly in front of this insti
tution, hence it was necessary for the
management to protest in order to make
arrests legal. It so happened that the pro
prietor was absent acd no one present ap
peared willing to authorize the arrest of
the alleged offenders. A colored clerk
finally told tbe officer to clear off the steps,
but not to adopt violent measures. Police
man Heard had his authority. Without
stopping to clear the steps as authorized,
he pushed roughly through the crowd and
informed Speaker Speed that he must stop
instantly.
"I have only one more word to say â I
am nearly done," protested Speed.
"That is ail right," replied Heard as be
placed his hand on the speaker. "You
must stop now or I will arrest you."
Without another word the Socialist
stepped from the stand, and then some one
suggested that it be moved to the oppo
site aide of the street. This was done, and
for more than an hour the speakers, un
interrupted, harangued an audience of
more than a thousand on the needs of the
nour from a socialistic standpoint.
"Last night our speakers were arrested
and cast into prison for holding a silence
meeting," said C. H. Davies. "To-day we
hold another public meeting, this time
giving utterance to our sentiments, and
we are simply required to move from one
side of the street to the other. This shows
conclusively that it is a matter of police
persecution and not legitimate prosecu
tion. We have rights and we propose to
exercise them, though we are practically
satisfied that justice is not to be had in
the police courts. The juries there are
pledged to conviction, but, thank God,
there are high r tribunals, and we feel
confident they will interpret the law justly
and honestly.
The men arrested Saturday night are in
dignant over the action of the authorities.
"I consider that they exceeded their au
thority," said Oliver Everett, Socialist
candidate for Mayor, yesterday. "Our
desire last night was to test the sincerity
of the Odd Fellows, who had protested
against noisy demonstrations. We think
the result shows that they were not
honest in their position. We don't pro
pose in future to be muzzled. We will
maintain the right of free speech at all
hazards. Ido not see how an intelligent
jury can possibly convict us. Heretofore
juries have been against as, though
whether through ignorance or prejudice
lam not prepared to say. There will be
a different ending this time, for there are
hither courts in California."
T. F. Burns, president of the Labor
Council, was among those arrested Satur
day night. In explaining the occurrence
he said yesterday :
"I was not speafcing, neither was I at
tempting to speak. I was standing on the
east side of Seventh street and there were
perhaps 150 people in that immediate vi
cinity. Suddenly the crowd shifted to the
west side of the street. I went over and
saw a policeman endeavoring to make two
ladies get out of the street. The officer
failed to intimidate the ladies. I was prob
ably seven or eight feet away when the po
liceman turned to me and ordered me to
move on. I started to move on, but I
didn't happen to move as fast as he
thought I should, whereupon he ordered
me to move faster. I replied that I was
perhaps the best judge as to how fast I
wanted to move. The lellow then grabbed
me by the shoulder, and, drawing his club,
said,' you; I will knock your
brains out.* I replied that I knew he was
anxious to use his club on me. I was
then earned to the station and charged
with obstructing the street. I have no
particular comment to make at this time
except to say that it was an outrageous,
high-handed proceeding. We have the
law on our side and I am sure that an hon
est court will bo decide."

SOUND MONEY THE ISSUE
Two of Berkeley's Town Board
Turned in Favor of Mc-
Kinley.
DEMOCRATS FOR 20 YEARS.
Professor William Carey Jones and
John Martin Speak in Favor of
Republicanism.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 30.â Two of
Berkeley's most prominent citizens and
members of the Board of Town Trustees,
who have voted the Democratic ticket for
the last twenty years, have declared them
selves in favor of McKinleyism and will
vote the Republican ticket at the coming
Presidential election. They are Professor
William Carey Jones, head of 'the depart
ment of jurisprudence at the State Uni
versity, member of the board from the
Second Ward, and John Martin, a promi
nent San Francisco business man and rep
resentative from the Fifth Ward.
Both men are members of families that
have long been distinguished for their
staunch adherence to the Democratic
party, and both have never before felt the
least inclination to turn from the political
paths followed by their ancestors. But
they say that the issues of the present
campaign are such as will amply justify
them in breaking the long chain of pre
cedent forged by their ancestors.
Professor Jones, who has been more or
less prominently connected with the ad
ministration of affairs in Berkeley for the
past six or seven years, having served a
previous term of office on the Town Board,
while determined to vote for McKinley in
November, says that his official position
in the university will not admit of his
making a statement as to why be has
turned from the Democratic party further
than that the financial policy of the Dem
ocrats does not suit him.
"A man in my position," said Professor
Jones to-day, "is in a dilemma to know
what to do when he has the interests of
his university on the one hand and the
interests of his country on the other. He
cannot speak with absolute freedom for
fear of criticism on the part of those who
mitrht mistake his views given from the
standpoint of a private citizen for those
of a professor of jurisprudence in a State
institution.
"It iÂ« most unfortunate for the Nation
that the present money question has to be
so insanely contested as it is. Some men
think one thing to-day and another to
morrow. Certainly affairs are in a great
turmoil. While I have an honest respect
for Democratic principles 1 cannot sup
port the issues they now have before the
people of the United States."
Trustee John Martin when interviewed
this afternoon was very outspoken in bis
views, and stated concisely nis reasons
for laying aside the party of his fore
fathers and the party he has supported
since tbe nomination of Hancock, for Me-
Kinleyism.
Mr. Martin has been known as one
of tbe strongest Democrats in Berke
ley, having organized, four years ago, the
first Democratic club at Lorin, which cast
a vote of 68 for Cleveland as against 63 for
Harrison in the last election.
"The Democratic party," said he, "has
not carried out the principles under which
it 'was founded, especially with reference
to the tariff. Instead of providing revenue
enough by the tariff they deliberately pre
pared a bill for the purpose of decreasing
the revenue and then attempted to make
up the deficit by passing an act to collect
an income tax. This income tax was de
clared by the Supreme Court to be uncon
stitutional, and then we were left without

a means to pay our national indebtedness.
The party in 1896 advocated a measure
for free coinage, the passing of which will
prove disastrous to the entire Nation and
will create monopolies never thought of
prior to this time, and much more vicious
in character than heretofore existing. Be
lieving it necessary to maintain tbe credit
of the Government and to create an honest
dollar with which to pay our workingman
for his services I deem it my duty as a
citizen to support the Republican National
platform.
"I favor a Government which will col
lect more revenue than is necessary rather
than one that will collect less than is
needed. With a shortage in the National
treasury, what are we to do in time of
war? lam satisfied without peradventure
of a doubt that the next President of the
United States will be the advocate of
sound money, and that advocate, as mat
ters now stand, is William McKinley of
Ohio."
The Republicans of Lorin will have a
grand rally ai Lorin Hall, Alcatraz
avenue, to-morrow evening, at which
Trustee Martin will give in detail his
views with relation to the financial ques
tion and his further reasons for leaving tbe
Democratic party. Among the other
speakers of the evening will be Hon. Wil
liam Lair Hill and Hon. S. P. Hall. It is
expected also that Congressman Hilborn
will be present and give expression to his
views.

them in tbe matter of work on tbe college
grounds.
'â¢What is commonly known as the 'po
lice force' at the university," said he, "has
not been giving efficient service for some
time past, nor has there been har
mony between the employes of the ad
ministration department and those of the
agricultural department.
"What we propose to do is to appoint a
man to take charge of both forces and to
direct their work as he sees necessary.
Under the present unorganized system of
labor about the grounds and buildings
much time and money are lost.
"Some of the employes have grown to
believe that the university cannot get
along without them, and in consequence
have been taking life easy. Regent Ruin
stein remarked to me the. other day that it
took two men half a day to move one
plank 100 yards. Though it will cost con
siderable to get a suitable man to look
after the carpenters, gardeners and jani
tors, yet we believe that tbe appointment
of such a man will be economical in the
long run."
Regent Reinstein sent over from San
Francisco last week McCallum, superin
tendent of Golden Gate Park, McLaren's
first assistant, to look into tne situation
and make a report.
No Decision Yet.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 30.â The
regents' committee on buildings and
erounds, consisting of J. West Martin,
Jobn E. Budd ana J. B. Reiustein, held a
lively session yesterday to consider the
bids submitted on the worK of the
Affiliated Colleges buildincs. They found
that the bids were about $14,000 in excess
of the $250,000 appropriation. One of the
committee stated that if a sufficient cut in
the bids cannot be made soon the entire
lot will have to be thrown out. The mat
ter will be finally decided at the monthly
meeting of the regents next Tuesday.
