GUAYAQUIL IS
SWEPT BY FIRE
Many Lives Reported Lost
in the Ecuadoran
City.
Thousands of Homeless Citizens
Camping in Near-by
Fields.
BUSINESS SECTION BURNED.
Provisions Are Scarce and the In-
habitants Are Threatened
With Famine.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. B.â The
Herald's special cable irom Guayaquil.
Ecuador, says: More than half this city
has been destroyed by fire. The loss of
life is great, but the exact number cannot
be given. The fire has been burning for
twenty-four hours and is not under
control.
Many persons who were in the arsenal
when the flames burst forth are believed
to have been burned. Thousands of citi
zens are homeless and are cammng in the
fields near the city. Provisions are scarce,
and there is some danger of famine.
In February last the city was visited by
a destructive fire, in which property worth
$1,000,000 was destroyed.
The Herald's dispatch from Panama
says that a dispatch from Guayaquil
states that the whole commercial portion
of the city, including four of the largest
banking institutions, were swept away by
the flames.
The losses are rongbly estimated at
$500,000,000. The correspondent says th*
Lre is beiieved to have been of incendiary
oriein.
Guayaquil has a population of 40,000
people. It is a Bishop's see and has nine
churches, a college, a seminary, convents
and two semi-weekly newspapers.
Large ships can come up to the town,
which is the principal port of Ecuador.
The chief exports are cocoa, Panama hats,
hides, cotton, tobacco, calisaya and other
barks, coffee, etc., valued in some years at
over $40"), 000,000, the imports being even
greater in value. It is the seat of several
manufacturing enterprises.
NEBRASKA BANK-ROBBERS.
Vaults at C/cytoria end Shelby
Wrecked by Explosions of
Dynamite.
LINCOLN, Nebe., Oct. 7.â Claytonia, a
village in Gage County, twenty-seven
miles south of Lincoln, was aroused at 1
o'clock this morning by a loud explosion.
It was found that the vault of the Clay
tonia Depository had been blown open
and abou; $1500 stolen. Two horses be
longing to Rev. Edward Sallenbach were
mis-ing. Three suspicious-looting men
who had been camping in the woods and
yesterday were in the village buying bread
are suspected. A large posse is scouring
the country for the robbers.
Wiiliam Steinmeyer, president of tbe
bank, came to Lincoln this morning, and
while he was reporting the robbery to the
Lincoln police Albert P. Anderson arrived
to report that the Bank of Shelby, Polk
County, had been robbed of $3100, of
which $20 was in pennies. Mr. Anderson
is president of the bank and lives in Lin
coln. He reported that the robbery oc
curred about 2 o'clock. The burglar- proof
safe was blown o[ en with dynamite. Many
heard the explosion and hurried to the
bank but found no one in sight.
Bhelby and Claytonia are seventy mile
apart, so two gangs were evidently at
work. The safe in the postoffa'ce at Glen
ville, twelve miles from Hastings, was
blown open Bunday night and $230, besides
stamps, was taken. All the work is that
of experts.
FOG WRECKS FOUR TRAINS.
Curious Combination of Accidents in the
Santa Fe Yardsâ Only One Man
Injured.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 7.â A curious
and unprecedented combination of wrecks
took place this morning in the yards of the
A Banta Fe Railroad at Argentine. A dense
_ fog caused the trouble. Four trains were
wrecfced, but, strange to say, only one
man was hurt, and he not fatally.
An easttound freight train in trying to
enter the yard was stopped by a switch
that refused to work. Before the trouble
could be remedied a special fast freight,
which was following close behind, came
along. On account of the fog the danger
signals were noi seen until too late. The
second train crashed into the rear of the
first one, wrecking the engine and several
cars.
Hardly had this collision occurred when
passenger train 8, due in Kansas City at
6:45. crashed into the rear of the wrecke I
special train, and a few minutes later
passenger train 2, the California limited,
ploweu throngh the rear oars of No. 8.
Only one -person was hurt in these
wrecks, a stockman named George
Slater, who had his arm broken ami his
Lea'i badly cut. His injuries, although
lainfui, are not considered dangerous.
The passengers were somewhat shaken,
but no one else was injured.
The . damage to railroad property
amounts to $50,000.

Homrn Are Irampltd Upon.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 7.â Several women

. house during the matinee performance
I this afternoon. A woman giving her name
*as Josephine Wright of Kansas City

noi^e, and instantly men, women and
children made a wild rush for the exitu.

RUN OA A SIN-TREASURY
The Political Uncertainty Causes Aiuc-
iety at St. Louis.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., Oct. 7.â For the past
heavy demands have been made upon the
United States Sub-Treasury here for gold

gold certificates. There was an average of
twenty in line all day to-day. At noon

Ihis gave rise to the report that local
brokers had organized to take, all tbe gold,
it was explained by those in line that
they were drawing the yellow metal to de
posit, owing to the uncertainty of the re
sult of the election. There is still about
$1,500,000 gold in the vault here.

SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 8, 1896.
THE LOCAL SITUATION.
BANK ROBBERY AND
DOUBLE MURDER
Thrilling Tragedy at Sher
bourne, in Southern
Minnesota.
Two Strangers Ride Into Town
on Bicycles and Kill
the Cashier.
ALSO A TRAVELING SALESMAN.
They Secure a Thousand Dollars and
Escape, W th Many Posses in
Vain Pursuit.
SHERBOURNE, Minn., Oct. 7.â This
town is in a state of excitement to-night
over the most thrilling tragedy that ever
occurred in Southern Minnesota. The
Bank of Sherbourne was robbed of a large
sum of money and two men were almost
instantly killed, about twenty minutes
after 1 o'clock this afternoon. About
noon two men, one of whom looked like a
mere boy, rode into the town on bicycles.
They were both well dressed. No particu
lar attention was paid to them as Sher
bourne is a town of but 300 people, most
of them workingmen, and at that hour
tbey were hurrying home to dinner.
The strangers hung around the out
skirts until shortly after 1 o'clock, ap
parently sizing up the situation. At that
time they sauntered lazily down the street
and stopped in front of the Bank of Sher
bourne. After a moment's talk they went
into the bank and the elder of the men
engaged Assistant Cashier George Tbor
burn in conversation. Precisely what oc
curred in the bank is not known, as no
body was on the street in that v'cinity at
the time. One of the desperadoes, how
ever, evidently got hold of a roll of bills
amounting to about $1000. Thorburn
probably tried to prevent the men from
getting away with the money, and tbey
drew their revolvers and began firing, at
the same time retreating. One of the
bullets struck Thorburn in the neck, caus
ing almost instant death.
The shooting in the bank aroused the
town, and people began running in that
direction. The first man to reach the place
waÃ Olaf Ostern of Luverne, a traveling
salesman for the Wood Harvester Com
pany of St. Paul. The desperadoes evi
dently feared they would De captured, as
they quickly turned their firearms upon
Ostern. He made a dash to grapple with
them, bin was not quick enough, as he
was struck in the head and fell dead at
their feet. They ran down the street,
firing at random, while people in the
street scurried to places of safety. The
fleeing robbers ran about three blocks to a
clump of bushes, where they mounted
â¢their wheels and rode rapidly away toward
the county line, six miles to the south.
Mayor C. E. Everrett at once did all in
his power, together with the Town Mar
shal, to run down the bandits. He also
sent a dispatch to Governor Clough at St.
Paul telling him of the tragedy and ask
ing his advice. The Governor answered
immediately: "Wire all points and send
out posses surrounding Sherbourne."
The Governor also wired W. P. Hill,
Bheriff of Martin County, to send out
posses at once and to wire all surrounding
points.
Sheriff Hill was at Fairmont, the
county seat of Martin County, twenty
miles east, but he came on here by train
and organized a large posse of determined
Sherbourne men, which moved southward
on horseback late in the afternoon.
At 10 o'clock to-night the Sheriff's posse
returned to town, having found no trace
of the desperadoes. A posse of 500 men
will leave here at daylight.
CEDAR KEYS' DEATH ROLL.
Early Reports of the Loss of Life in the
Recent Tornado Were Not
Exaggerated.
CEDAR KEYS, Fla., Oct. 7.â A suffi
cient time has now elapsed since the late
storm to gather some data and make an
estimate of the losses therefrom. The
first reports of loss of life and property
sent from here, though hastily given, were
not exaggerated. Words fail to describe
the appearance of the town or to describe
the condition of the people. Not a single
bouse on the island escaped damage.
From all reports the losses are deplor
able along the coast, from here to the
Suwanee River not a house is standing,
and the survivors are without food, shel
ter or clothing. They are constantly com
ing with sorrowful stories of want and
suffering. The town is doing all that is
possible to give employment in the way
of clearing the streets, etc., but this goes
only a little way in providing relief. The
people here do not expect a train for
months, though the railroad has a large
force of men at work. Everything is
washed out from the tour-mile post.
The names of those Known to be
drowned follow: George, Henry and Frank
Havens; Mrs. Beacham, Mrs. C. W. Doar
and three children, Mrs. Missouri Branch
and daughter, S. C. Gauz, Sam G, Robin
son, Frank Hall, Bim Branin, all white,
and Bradshaw Campbell and four
spongers, colored. Added to this list are
P. J. Spear, Ailes Bass, Joe Brooker and
Bob Ezell. They had started from here
on Monday night for a point up the coast,
though warned of an approaching storm.
Only one body ha 3 been found, that of
Spear, but there is no doubt that all shared
the same fate. The sponge fleet must
have scattered in several directions, and
some no doubt escaped the fury of the
storm, as it is learned from both sides of
this place that there was nothing serious
in the way of wind or tide at a distance of
thirty miles off. Others were undoubtedly
lost
reoria , Watch factory ; Burned.
PEORIa, lil., Oct. 7 â Early this morn
ing fire broke out in the watch factory
building, occupied by the F. P. Ide Manu
lacturing Company and the Parsons Hor
oiojrical Institute, and in a short time the
structure was in ruins. The total loss is
$124,000; insurance, $136,000.

Russia.
THE FORTE GROWS BOLDER.
Demands the Right to Board Foreign
Vessels and S arch for Arme
nians
CONSTANTINOPLE, Ttjbkey, Oct. 7.â
The Porte has sent a note to the powers
demanding the right to board foreign ves
sels in Turkish waters for the purpose of
searching for Armenians.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 7.â The Post to
morrow will print a dispatch from Con
stantinople, saying that tbe Porte has de
cided not to admit Greek, Dutch and
American guardships to trie Hellespont.
It is known, the dispatch says, that Rus
sia objects to the admission of these ves
sels. The United States Government, it is
added, has not as yet made application for
the admission of her warships.
RESIGNS THE LEADERSHIP.
Lord Jtoaebery Viaagreea With Bit Party
on the Turkish Question.
LONDON, Eno., Oct. 7.â The Central
News is authority for tbe statement that
Lord Rosebery has written to Sir Thomas
Ellis, M. P., tbe first whip of the Liberals,
resigning the leadership of the party. The
reason given for his lordship's resignation
is that he disagrees with Mr. Gladstone
and other leading Liberals regarding the
proper policy to be adopted on the East
ern question.
Lord Rosebery's letter is dated at his
seat, Dalmeny Park, Linlithgowshire,
October 6. In tha communication his
lordship says:
"The recent course of events makes it
necessary to clear the air. I find myself
in apparent difference with a considerable
mass of the Liberal party on the Eastern
question, and in some conflict with the
opinion of Mr. Gladstone, who must
necessarily exercise matchless authority
with the party, while scarcely from any
quarter do I receive explicit support.
This situation, except as regards Mr. Glad
stone, is not altogether new, but in saying
this I complain of no one and regret only
that I should appear to divide the energies
and try the faith of the Liberals.
"This question, however, is above and
beyond personal considerations, and when
1 speak, which I do this week, I must
speak my mind, without reference to party.
"Under these circumstances it is best for
the party and for myself that I speak not
as a leader, but as a freeman. Conse
quently I beg to notify you that the
leadership of the party, so far as I am
concerned, is vacant and that I resume
my liberty of action. I can only feel tbe
deepest gratitude and regret at parting
from you and those who like you have
given me such loyal co-operation under
circumstances so difficult."
ENGLAND AND VENEZUELA.
The St. James Gazette Bitterly Complains
of Affronts and Outrages Perpetrated
on Its Countrymen.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 7.â The St. James
Gazette devotes a leading article to the
discussion of the Venezuelan question and
insists that no progress has been made
toward a settlement of the dispute. The
paper recites the Venezuelan affronts and
outrages perpetrated on Englishmen and
concludes by saying:
"If such insults and outrages had been
addressed to the meanest sister republic
in South America there would have been
war long ago. Any other European power
would not have stood it a week, yet we sit
with folded bandÃ and permit one slap in
the face to succeed another. We hope
most sincerely that the negotiations with
the United States will result peacefully,
but nothing is to be gained by shutting
our eyes and crying 'peace' where there is
no peace."
The Gazette adds that Venezuela's atti
tude in regarding the construction of a
railway to Barinia as a violation of the
Venezuelan treaty is an insult.
"BEST SOLDIER OF FRANCE."
General Louis Jules Zrochu finally Van-
quished by Death.
LONDON, Ekg., Oct. 7. â A .dispatch
from Paris to the Central News announces
tbe death of General Trocnu.
Louis Jules Trochu was born March 12,
1815. He became captain in 1843, served
as chief of the general staff in the Crimean
war, and obtained the rank of general of
brigade in 1354. He was a great strate
gist. In 1864 he was raised to tbe rank of
general of division, and about 1860 was
directed to perfect a plan to reorganize
the army. On this subject he wrote a
popular book called "L'Armee Fran
caise." In August, 1870, he was appointed
major-general of the army . and com
mander-in-chief of the forces in Paris.
"He is undeniably." says the Army and
Navy Journal for July, 1870, "the best
soldier of France."
On the formation of the republic, Sep
tember 4, he became president of the ex
ecutive committee, tne highest office in
the provisional government. He com

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
FOUR SPEECHES BY
MAJOR McKINLEY
Piercing Cold Wind Has No
Effect Upon the
Visitors.
The Thousands Warmed by the
Logical Utterances of the
Speaker.
MANY FARMERS IN THE THRONG
Bring Wives and Children Alongâ Over
Two Hundred Women in the
Parade.
CANTON, 111., Oct. 7.- Major McKin
ley had 3600 visitors to-day and made four
speeches. The weather was disagreeable.
A sharp wind from the north chilled the
air and made people shiver. The inclem
ency of the weather had no effect upon
the size or enthusiasm of the delegations,
however, the visitors from Geauga County,
Ohio, numbered 2500; from Ashland
County, 400; from Parltersburg and other
points in West Virginia and from Indi
ana, 100.
The big delegation from Geauga County
and the one from Ashland were composed
of farmers. They brougnt their wives
and children with them and there were
more than 200 women in line when the
delegations paraded the streets. The first
speech was made to the First McKinley
Club of Indiana, as follows:
My fellow-citizens: It gives me great pleas
ure to meet you here at my home this morn
ing. It is always a distinction to have a po
litical organization to adopt one's name. It
is especially gratifying to me to be assured
that if you were not the first club in the
United States to give me the honor of adopt
ing my name you were certainly the first in
the State of Indiana, and I thank you for this
honor ana compliment.
We are engaged this year In a great National
contest, the result of which will determine for
years to come the public policies which shall
govern this country. Government is always
an interesting study. There is a good deal of
misunderstanding as to how a Government
gets its money. There are some people who
seem to believe that the way the Government
gets its money is to make it. The Government
gets its money by taxation, and can get it in
no other way.
There are three or four sources â¢ from which;
the Government of the United States gets tha
money with which to pay the running ex
penses. Tbe chief sources of revenue are
through tariffs and internal revenue.
Then the Government gets some money
through the sale of Us public lands and gets
some money from Its postal service, and from
these sources there comes the money that is
annually required to meet and discharge pub
lic expenses.
Now if the Government had power to make
money, as some people believe, or had the
power to adopt the value of a thing, -it would
not need to resort to taxes; it would simply
set its mints to work and make the necessary
money to pay its running expenses. There ia
another thing I would have you all know, that
is, the Government cannot get gold or silver
except through the Custom-house or the In
ternal Revenue Office or from the sale of;
public lands without giving something for it,
just as you and I have to give something for it
if we want gold or silver or paper money.
Now, how does the Government distribute
its money? Somebody asked me that question
the other day. How does the Government dis
tribute the money? The Government distri
butes its receiptsâ its annual receipts â by an
appropriation of Congress to its creditors.
That's the way the money of the Government
is distributed. It is distributed in payment
of the army, the navy, public improvements,
rivers and harbors, the great postal service of
the country, the Congress, the interest on the
Government bonds and the principal of tha
Government bonds, and tbe pensions ol
soldiers, and there is no other way for the
Government to distribute any money it has
except to the people it owes. There is no such,
thing as a general distribution of money by
the Government of the United states.
The point I want to make in the little talk
I give you this morning is 'that the Govern
ment does not create money, cannot create
money, and whatever money it needs it has
got to collect from taxes on its people, either
by a system of direct taxation or by a system
of indirect taxation known as the tariff, and it
the Government wants to have any gold or
silver minted for Its own use it has got to pay
lor that gold and silver just as you and I have
to pay for it if we want it for our purpose*.
[ADplause.]
He concluded:
I thank you, my fellow-citizens, for this call,
and it will give me very great pleasure to
meet and greet each one of you. [Applause.]
Major McKinley spoKe briefly. His
utterances were full of patriotism and
strong pleas for the cultivation of a broad
National spirit.
The next speech was to the Ashland
County delegation. Responding to the
remarks of Dr. Chess, the spokesman, he
said:
I had expected to concentrate the visiting
delegations from Ohio into one audience to
day, but the delegations that are coming are
so large that there is no hall in the town that
would hold them. [Laughter and applause.]
Taking op the money question he said;
It Is proposed now that we shall enter upon
the day not only of depreciated currency, but
of depreciated paper money. But to that tha
Republican party answers: "No; forever no."
Some people seem sometimes to despair of the
' I Heh v I rig *vS
5s 2^ fSatfffl2
future of the United States. Nobody need
have any appreheusions on that score.
The United States is too great and to re-
Bourceful to have its progress impeded for any
considerable length of time by any political
PTjrty. And this year we stand as ir. 1878 for
the restoration of a protective policy. In
1892, a year ihe most prosperous in our his
tory, we were under a protective policy.
Every mfin in this country who wanted to
â¢work could find work, and every man who
worked in this country in 1892 got better
wages than he ever got in any other period of
our history or in any other period of the
world's Mstsry. [Avplause.]
The farmers of this country had the best
boinc market in the world; had more con
sumers than they had ever had before, and
had better paid consumers. But that has all
changed. The advertisements in 1592 in the
newspapers used to run "'Men Wanted." The
advertisements that run ia the newspapers
to-day read ''Situations Wanted." [Applause.]
Our policy seeks to give a situation to every
roan of this country who wants work and the
policy of partial free trade has put the work
lnemen in a situation which entails upÂ«n
'them loss and upon every farmer of the coun
lry injury in his home market.
Now, what we want to do, my fellow-citizens,
this year is to stand by these great, principles.
I make no personal appeal to you. I make no
mere party appeal to you. I appeal to you in
tiie name of the country to give your votes
this year to that party which you believe will
subserve your high interests and promote the
greatest prosperity to our common country.
[Applause and cries of "That's what we are
going to do."]
The next delegation was a big one from
Geauga County, Ohio, whicti is in the
heart of the Western Reserve. The spokes
man, Judge JJaniield, said Geauga County
had a smaller percentage of crime and il
literacy and a larger Republican vote in
proportion to its population than any
other county in Ohio.
Major McKiniey addressed them as
follows:
The people of Ohio have improved every
opportunity that has presented to them |
to add nonor to the American name and to |
bring liberty and opportunity to the people. \
This State, In 18G0, in the National Republi
can Convention which met in the city of
Chicago, had two candidates for tne Presi
dency. One was Salmon P. Chase and the
other was Benjamin Wade, both honored
names in Ohio's history, and both names that
have added luster to the glory of our country.
[Great applause.]
When the third ballot was reached in that
convention Mr. Lincoln led, and had 231^2
votes. He lacked just I}^ votes of being nomi
nated for the Presidency of the United States.
It was at that critical moment that an Ohioan,
David K. Carter, one Representative in Con
gress from our State, rose in his place and
transferred four votes from Salmon P. Chase
to Abraham Lincoln, and made him the nomi
nee of the Republican party. [Great cheering.]
lam glad he did it. Some other State might
have done it; some other Sjtate probably would
have done it; but the fact remains that Ohio
did it, and helped to give to tne country that
immortal name. [Loud applause.]
Ohio has been no laggard in the pathway of
civilization ; she has never hesitated before in
any emergency; she nas never fallen in any
crisis; she has measured up to the highest op- j
portunity of responsibili ty and duty ; she has !
never struck a blow except for human liberty, j
Ohio this year will neither pause nor ponder, !
but stand for country and country's honor. I
[Cries of "That's right."] The Republican
party made the Union stronger than it ever
bad been before acd it preserved to us and to
our posterity the starry banner of the free.
[Cheering.] It made the old war greenback
that traveled with the soldier on his marches !
as good as gold and redeemable in gold, j
[Loud applause.] It resumed specie payments !
and has preserved the National honor unsul- '
lied to this hour and given the Nation a credit
the like of which it never had before. Will
that party now take a step backward? Will
the old party lower its Flag? [Cries of ''Never,
never. I ']
You want a dollar that is worth a dollar ;
you do not want a 52-cent dollar. [Cries of
"No, no; you bet we don't 11 ] Tney say to one
audience that our dollars are too dear, and to
another audience they say the new free-coin- i
age silver dollar will be just as eocd as the
present silver dollar. Now, if that is so it will
be just as dear as the present dollar. We want j
good money in this country and we want good i
morals in this country and we want public â 
und private honesty ia this country. [Great !

tion of repudiators. (.Tremendous applause.]
I thank you, my fellow-citizens, for this call.
It is an encouragement to the cause and it is an
inspiration to every Republican. [Cheers.]
Major McKinley's last speech of the day
was made to a spirited and enthusiastic
delegation from West Virginia. The
spokesman was C. T. Caldwell of Parkers
burg, W. Ya. His speech was an uncom
monly earnest and moving one. Major
McKiniey addressed the West Virginia
people as follows:
The interests of West Virginia are identical
with the interests of every other section of our
country. The interests of your State are iden
tical with the interests of my State. They
have no divided interests. They are one and
indivisible. No longer are they separated in
interest or affection or fraternity Ay the un
happy events of thirty-five years ago. The
wounds then Inflicted have been healed. The
bitterness then engendered has been as
feuaged.
He spoke at some length on the tariff,
concluding:
We have tried experience, and we know that
when we have been on the ship of experience
we sailed safely into port, and when we have
taken the raft of experiment we have always
gone down. [Long and continued applause.]
THOUSANDS ARE TURNED AWAY.
Great Crush at Music Hall in Cincinnati
When Ex-President Harrison
Speaks.
CINCINNATI. Ohio., Oct. 7.â Over
?0,000 people tried to bear ex-President
Harrison speak at Music Hall to-night.
Ten thousand succeeded ; the balance were
turned away. The meeting was charac
terized by the wildest enthusiasm through
out. Thomas McDougall, whose voice
was hoarse from continued speaking, in
troduced Mr. Harrison, who said in part:
I have had a suspicion for some time that
has been settled to-night. It is tnat it is not
worth while trying to keep the Presidency out
cf Ohio. Governor McKiniey, who was named
by the Republican convention at St. Louis for
President, is a man whose personal character
is irreproachable. His is not the arduous
greatness of things said but.of things done. [Ap
plause.]
There is a general concurrence now in the
fact that we are not living iv good times and
a remedy must be applied.
The remedy we propose is this: that a har
monious, weli-adjusted revenue-producing
and protective tariff shall be substituted for
that in force at present. We propose that the
revenues of the Government shall be made
adequate to meet expenditures. We propose
that the necessity for bond sales to replenish
a diminished treasury and to restore a wasted
gold reserve shall be remedied by filling the
treasury with adeau&te revenue. [Applause.]
We propose that the money of the countryâ
every aollar of itâ shall be kept at a parity
with other dollars.
What do our Democratic friends offer? Free
silver. This would Help the producer of silver
bullion. Mr. Bryan has admitted that the
sliver miner would get what he called an
"Incidental benefit" from having 50 cents
wortn of bullion coined into a dollar. It is a
direct benefit. These great stock companies,
these bouauza miners who have grown enor
mously rich, reap the benefit. The Demo
cratic party has entered into a career so
widely separated from the old lines that every
prominent man who has had a hand in their
councils has deserted them.

"If Our Emp'oycs Don't "Vote as
They Pleas? We'll Discharge
Them."
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 7.â W. J. Bryan
finished his Indiana campaign at Ham
mond this evening and reached Chicago
shortly before 10 o'clock to-night. Hi
stay here was short, for in thirty minutes
he "was on board the Burlington train
bound for Burlington, lowa, where he
speaks to-morrow.
The union station was jammed with
people to-night when the candidate's train
arrived, but the crowd was not admitted
inside the iron fence and Mr. Bryan
escai>od any inconvenience from over
crowding, in response to cheers Mr.
Bryan showed himself for a few minutes,
but did not speak. Tha candidate ap
peared to be in the best of health.
A vast audience, numbering between
15,000 and 20,000, greeted Mr. Bryan at
Hammond. He arrived here just before
7 o'clock, and after supt>er was escorted to
the scene of the meeting, a big open lot.
He was greeted with tremendous enthusi
asm. He spoke in part as follows:
I understand tnat some employersâ l do ngt
know whether they have done it here â have
tried to convince their employes that under
free coinage their pay would only be half as j
much as what they now get. I want to call j
your attention to one thing. If under free i
coinage your dollars will only buy naif us;
muca that means that your employers would |
get twice us much for what they produceâ j
twice as many dollarsâ as they do now; ana if j
your employer? get twice as many dolltirs as !
they do now* then they can pay you twice as
many dollars for your wages as they do now, ]
if they love you as well after election us they I
seem to love you now, before election, when I
they want your votes. [Great applause and
laughter.]
But, my friends, instead of resorting to ar
gument, some of the employers nave resorted
to coerciou. [Applause and cries of "That 1 * |
so!' 1 ] That is, they have attempted to malte ]
their employes think as they want them to i
think. I Â«aw a sign down in Nashville, Term., i
and l wish you would remember this sign, â¢
stretched over the door of a store, containing
these words: "If our employes don't vote as |
they please we will discharge them. 1 ' My :
friends, that is the right kind of a sign to
have. Instead of saying that if their emp.oves ;
don 1 ! vote as the managers want them they;
will discharge mem, these employers ought to
put up the sign that they had in Tennessee.
[Laughter cud applause.]
My friends, I recognize that in this cam
paign w have great influences against as. I
recognize that our opponents are able to col
lect enormous campaign lunds. I recognize
that they are able to carry great excursions to
their candidate. But I Relieve that when I ]
come to the people themselves instead of hay- i
ing them sent to me I can present qnr cauee I
and appeal to the hearts of the American peo
! pie. [Applause and .cheering.] I believe that
| our cause is just, and that the people of this
country cannot be corrupted by a large cam- '
paign iund. Neither can they be intimidated !
by their employers. Our hope of victory lies I
i not in a corruption fund, not in the employ- j
I mentof force, but in an honest appeal to the i
I unpurchased and unpurchasabie voters of the '
I United States. [Cheering.]
I am aware, my friends, that they may
! threaten to take your privileges from you, but j
I remember that the laboring men of this !
! country have secured the Australian bailor
i system and tyranny stands outside while the
i voter goeÂ« inside. [Applause] My friends, I
have not come to ask the vote of any man ; I
I have not come to tell you how to cast that
j vote; I come simply to present our cause. I
i believe we are right. I believe the policies for I
: which we stand mean peace and prosperity to |
the great masses of the people of this country, j
I [Applause.] And if you so believe I ask you i
j to record your vote with us>. I beg you to
I study this question and make your vote mean
exactly what you think your vote ought to
mean.
Mr. Bryan made speeches at Tipton,
j Xoblesviile and several other places en
! route from Indianapolis to Hammond.
; At Logansport he addressed two meeting- 1 , j
: On the arrival of his special train at the j
\ latter place he was escorted by brass i
! bands and silver clubs to the residence of j
1 Judge David D. Dykeman, where the can- j
didate. Governor Matthews, J. G. Shank- j
lin, National Committeeman from Indi- |
ana, John W. Tomlinson of Alabama and j
the other mempers of the party were en
tertained at luncheon. The first speech
took piace at Riverside Park, where the
audience numbered about 15,000. Near |
the stand from which Mr. Bryan spoke a ;
delegation of old soldiers was gathered,
and the candidate referred to their pres
ence in his speech. The assemblage was
very enthusiastic. He spoke in part as
I follows:
It gives me great pleasure to be permitted to
address the citizens of this place, and 1 desire
to express my special thanks to those veter
ans of the war" who have so kindly taken part >
in the exercises to-day. I say l appreciate the :
attendance of these war veterans. The inter-;
ests of the soldier will be safe in the hands of â 
those who are fighting as Important a battle !
to-day as they fought years ago. [Great cheer- !
ing.] For, my friend's, it is as important to a
nation that it shall not be subjected to the dic
tation of any foreign power as it is that we
shall preserve it as a nation among ourselves.
In fact I consider the voting men of to-day
who are too young to have shown their
love of country upon the battlefield.
I consider them fortunate in having an op
portunity to prove not only their love of coun
try, but their love of mankind by beating off
this invader from abroad. The gold standard
is not an American idea. It wan never ac- |
cepted by our people; it was brought into this
country in the dark and without discussion
and has never in a single campaign received
the support of any party. [Applause.]
If you people believe that times are as good
as they could be, if you believe our present
financial system is g^od and ought to be con
tin aed, then, my friends, you ought to vote
the Republican ticket; but if you are dissatis
fied with present conditions, if you are dissat
isfied with our present financial system, if you
believe it can be improved, you huve got to
secure that improvement from those who want
to change it, not from I nose who want to keep
it as it is.
The Republican manager's idea of circula
tion v to circulate a large amount of money
just before election in order to contract the
currency right after electionâ and the Repub
lican manager claims that he is the advance
agent of prosperity, [daughter.]
My friends. I am afraid the chairman of the
Republican National Committee is the fore
runner of the advance agent of that peculiar
form of prosperity that comes just before an
election to those who expect to make enough
now to run them until the next campaign.
[Great cheering.]
The second speech was made from a
stand at the corner of Fifth and North
streets. People were massed in both
thoroughfares in its vicinity, and great
difficulty was experienced in getting Mr.
Bryan through. At the conclusion of the
speech Mr. Bryan was escorted to his
train by a cheering multitude, and at#:2o
left for Hammond. On his journey from
Logansport to Hammond Mr. Brvan
spoke at Crown Point.

NAILING CAMPAIGN CANARDS.
Democratic Misstatements of Facts

CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 7.â Hon. W. T.
Duibin, a member of the National Repub
lican Committee for Indiana and in
charce also of Michigan, has recently re
turned from the last named state. Of the
outlook Mr. Durbin said:
â¢'We are well pleased with the situation
in Michigan and have no doubt that the
final results will be largely in our favor.
We want to add to this general victory by
electing twelve Republican Congressmen
and feel that this will be done. T) c Re
publican campaign is in excellent shape
ail over tbe Middle West and I am practi
cal! y assured that McKiniey will be chosen
in Indiana, my native State, where every
thing is working nicel)\ In Illinois, as
well as lowa, Winconsin and Minnesota,
j the prospects are most favorable. It is a
j wonderful campaign and the charge in
sentiment is marvelous."
A morninp paper published to-day a
j special from New York which represented
I Air. Hanna as having lost confident^ in
the result of the election in tne Middle
States. At headquarters this report was
received with smiles. Mr. Payne said he
would pre/er to see the statement over
j Mr. Hanna's own signature than to tp
! ceive it through a newspaper. Mr. Hanna
and the Western headquarters were in full
accord and were not worrying.
Denying a statement alleged to have
been made by the Democratic managers
that the Ohio Farmer, an agricultural
pappr of Cleveland, Ohio, had been offered
j $10,000 by Mr. Hanna to work for the gold
' standard, a bulletin issued from Repub

CHICAGO, 111., /Oct. 7.â The Demo
cratic managers evince even greater con
fidence in ; the. result of the campaign as
the time for work grows shorter. ; In the
official bulletin issued to-day it is stated
that the reports received at headquarters
impress upon the managers that the elec
tion of Bryan is practically * assured; al
though no efforts will bo spared alo -g the
line to make that majority safe and render
it larger. From Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Minnesota and lowa come ire
ports of the most flattering nature. l The
managers of -Michigan are as sure of that
State as they are that Texas and Colorado
will >go "for Bryan. Similar assurances
come -\ from Minnesota, while Chairman
Wall of Wisconsin expresses equal confi
dence that bis State will be saiely in the
Bryan column.
'â¢From Ohio," continues the bulletin,
â¢'comes a. report that the McKinleyites
are on the run; that the farmers and
miners have come over to Bryan in a body
and that i his majority in; that State will
be not less than 25,000. Indiana is in
line, a poll of that State showing ' that
Bryan's majority will be not less than
20,000 and may go -as high as 30,000.
From lowa comes reports . that the
Democrats will sweep nearly every county

ARTHUR IS FOR McKINLEY.
Grand Chief of the Engineers' Brother'
hood _J)r fines His Position.
NEW i YORK, N. V., Oct. 7.-The Re
publican National Committee has discov
ered that a circular is being secretly dis
tributed among railroad employes which
is destined to give the impression that P.
M. Arthur, grand chief engineer of the
International Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, favors the free and unlimited
coinage of silver. The circular * having
been brought to the attention of N. B.
Scott" of the Republican National Com
mittee, the latter wrote a letter to Mr.
Arthur, and the reply shows that Mr.
Arthur is for sound money and McKiniey.
The following is the letter from Mr.
Arthur:-
Mr. K. B. Scott, New York â Dear Sir: Your
esteemed favor, with circular inelosej, ; re
ceived and read with care. That there may be
no misunderstanding concerning j my attitude
toward the two parties, whatever, what I say
must be accepted as coming from an individ
ual, not as an executive officer of , the Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers.
About two years ago a gentleman called
upon Mr. Sargent and 1 at the Gibson House,
and read us what was purported to be a peti
tion to Congress.' Alter listening attentively to
the reading of the document, he asked me if I
wonld sign it. I did so, and thought no more
about it until the past two months, when I
find it is being circulated and used for politi
cal purposes. 1 understood at the time that It
was to be presented to Congress asking for the
enactment of laws in the interest of : labor. . I
cannot say;- whether | the present circular is a
true copy of 'that one. I may Â«ay, however,
that I am not in favor of the free and un
limited coinage of silver, and intend to vote
for McKiniey regardless of what may have
been said or done in the past. Respectfully
yours, . "., j.-: ; : , ÂP. M. Arthvr.

LINCOLN-DOUGLAS
TABLET UNVEILED
Knox College Honors the
Memory of the Joint
Debaters.
A Galesburg Celebration Which
Has Been Under Way
for a Year.
CHAUNCEY DEPEW3 ORATION
Soldiers' Monument Unveiled by Hon.
Robert T. Lincolnâ Political
Speaking at Might.
jj|ALESBURG, 111., Oct. 7.â Knox Col
lege to-day honored the memory of Lin
col and Douglas by the unveiling of a
bronze tablet commemorate of the thirty
eighth anniversary of the Lincoln Doug
las j oint debate. Preparations for this cel
ebration have been under way for a year
and a large crowd was present to witness
the exercises.
During the morning a beautiful soldiers'
monument in Hope Cemetery was un
veiled. Shortly after 10 o'clock a parade
composed of the local G. A. K. passed
through the streets and was reviewed in
the public square by tbe Mayor, Chaun
cey M. Depew, Senator Palmer and other
distiguished guests. ThÂ§ procession then
marched to Hops Cemetery, where the
monument was unveiled by the Hon. Rob
ert T. Lincoln. As the monument was un
veiled it was saluted by a number of
rounds of cannon. Hon Robert T. Lin
coln then delivered the address. He said
in part:
The question debated here In 1858 was one
as to which it now seems almost incredible
that there could have been opposing parties,
and yet that question caused the longest and
mo3t bitter war of modern times. Human
shivery had buen protected by the laws ot the
United States iv fifteen States of the Union.
The Republican party was formed by those
who believed slavery to be a heinous wrong
to the enslaved and economically injurious to
the community in which it existed, but the
party was formed not to attack slavery in the
States where it was then lawful, but to pre
vent its extension into other States. The can
didate of that party was elected President in
1860, and as chief magistrate he was at once
confronted by the attempted secession from
the Union of at first seven but soon eleven
States, with a population of 5,500,000 whites
and 3,500,000 slaves.
In spite of the most solemn and the most
authoritative assurances to the contrary the
people of the seceding States claimed that
their rights and property were menaced by the
new administration; they formed a separate
Government as a nation; created armies; de
stroyed all National property within their 1
limits and d'-fied the constitution and the
laws of the Union. Suddenly the world saw
the uprising of a great people. Before the
little garrison or Fort Sumpter had marched
from its ruined walls a proclamation was
drawn by the President calling for 75,000
soldiers to suppress the insurrection, but ere
there was time to issue it there came to him to
p'.edge the earnest support of his great ability
and widespread influence in re-establishing
the authority of the National Government the
great Democratic leader who had been his
life-long political antagonist, Stephen A.
Douglas. In the peritof the Republic the con
tentions of DemocyAy and Republicanism
were by him and the President put aside, and
for the first time in their lives they clasped
hands as allies in a public cause.
And now let us dedicate this monument to
tbe memory of these patriotsof Galesburg and
to patriotism. The reflections of more than
thirty years have turned the once bitterly
warring streams of sentiment into one broad
river, on whose current is borne in safety and
in glory the ship of State, and no one lives
under the protection of its flag who does not
at heart rejoice that the rock of disunion was
exploded from its path and the canker of
human slavery torn from its framework.
The event of the day took place shortly
after 1 o'clock. A reception committee,
composed of the sophomore class of Knox
College and a number of prominent citi
zens, escorted Mr. Depew, Mr. Lincoln
and Senator Palmer to a large platform,
which had been erected in front of the
collece. After music by the Knox College
cadet band an address of welcome was de
livered by Colonel Clarke E. Carr. This
was followed by an address by C. E. Nash,
president of Lombard University. The
anniversary oration was then delivered by
Chaoncey M. Depew.
In opening his address Mr. Depew re
cited tbe conditions under which Lincoln
and Douglas fought thirty-eight years
ago. The apparent contest, he said, was
the statehood of Kansas, but both the
orators and the people knew that tbe
tremendous issue was between freedom
ana slavery, the dissolution of the Union
or its perpetuity. He continued :
The compromise of 1820, by declaring ail of
the new territory north of parallel 36.30 free
and all south slave and admitting Missouri,
which was north, as a slave State, was grate
fully accepted. But later the crisis, as always
with the threat of secession behind it, became
acme and was once more tided over by the
compromises of 1850. By these measures
slavery secured National recoenition of the
institution at the capital and the enactment
of the fugitive slave law, but the Union
saved was regarded by the vast majority as
well worth this sacrifice of honor, morality
and liberty.
The convention of 1852 met to nominate a
President. Webster's famous speech had been
of incalculable service to the South In carry
ing its measures through Congress, but it nnd
destroyed his availability with the North. He
was defeated, and the greatest statesman of
the century died of disappointment and mor
tification.
The war with Mexico had added an enor
mous area of territory to the National do
main. The North, absorbed in diversified in
dustries and material development, paid little
heed to the future, but the South, recognizing
the growing hostility to its institutions,
formed the plan of a permanent balance of
power. This was to be accomplished by ad
mitting no free Suite unless one which recog
nized slavery came in at the same time. Then,
with the Senate equally divided between iree
and slave States, slavery would be forever safe
from hostile legislation.
To accomplish this the Missouri compromise
must be repealed. The South grew daily more
threatening and the North more sensitive. To
the man who could bridge this chasm and fool
the North as it nad been so often successfully
hoodwinked before and satisfy the alert and
clear-purposed South the Presidency was cer
tan. Stephen A. Douglas, a statesman of in
finite resources, courage and ambition, under
took the task. He adroitly put the abolition
ists of the North and the fire-eaters of the
South in the category of disunionists and then
bid for that conservative support which al
ways controls in great crises.
"Let the people of all sections go as they list
with their property.whether chattels or slaves,
into the Territories," be said, "and when the
period of statehood arrives they can decide by
ballot whether they will recognize or exclude
slavery, or they may determine the questin ion
the Territorial Legislatures."
This remedy captivated the public mind,
but started a race between the free and slave
State people to capture Kansas. Bold raiders
from Missouri poured over the border, carry
ing murder and pillage among the free-State
settlers. Civil war with all Us horrors rajted
on the plains of Kansas. Tbe slave power,
entrenched in the White House and Congress,
the courts, and repeatedly and recently sus
tained in the elections, felt confident that ex
treme measures for securing Kansas could be
safely pushed. With me whole strength of
the administration behind the conspirators,
the Lecompton constitution fastening slavery
on the new State was fraudulently adopted.
Douglas alone, of ihe Democratic leaders,
opposed this and demanded that the constitu
tion should be submitted to the people of
Kansas. Douglas was hailed by the Northern
wing of the party as its savior, but the Dred
Scott decision demolished his beautiful fabric
of squatter sovereignty, and a less resourceful
or weaker man would have been buried in iia
ruins.
Such were the political conditions when
Douglas entered the lists for re-election to the
Senate from Illinois. One man blocked the
way, and with such tremendous force and su
perb ability that his effort consolidated the
free sentiment of the country, sbolished slav
ery and saved^the Union. * That man was
Abraham Lincoln.
Mr. Depew followed with a concise his
tory of Lincoln's life, and showed how
thoroughly he was in sympathy with the
movement to abolish slavery. He re
counted at leneth the vigorous* campaigns
made by the two great leaders which cul
minated in the history-making debate at
Galesburg thirty-ciiht years ago to-day,
dwelt upon the characteristics of the two
debaters, and showed with consummate
skill the points of each and t .eir modes of
attack. The famous passages at arms by
the two great men were rehearsed and the
well-remembered words were cheered to
tbe echo. In closing Mr. Depew said:
Upon this platform and on this very spot
thirty-eight years aso to-day stood these intel
lectual athletes. Neither they nor the vast
audience wiiicfe enjoyed their thrust and par
ries, cheered their effective blows and were
entranced by their eloquence know how rap
idly they were making history; how ably they
were preparing the most important chapter in
the storÂ» of the nineteenth century. It was
the battle eternally going en, "often lost, but
never won," between principle and expedi
ency.
Lincoln was tall, gaunt, awkward and home
ly, with a high, penetrating voice which
reached easily to the utmost limits of the
crowd. Douglas was short, corpulent and dig
nified, witn the grace and courtesy of Senato
rial association, and spoke with deep tones and
slow enunciatiou, as if every word was
weighted with an important argument. Doug
las was the more adroit debater, Lincoln the
more ardent reasoner. Douglas could cap
ture the crowd by those courtesies to his
opponent behind which he misrepresented his
position, while Lincoln, untrained to compli
ment, grew resentful and harsh at these suc
cessful falsifications. Lincoln could lift his
audience by a passionate appeal to their better
nature for the slave, for justice and for lib
erty. Douglas was always the fighter and de
bater. Lincoln consciously and Douglas
unconsciously were preparing the people
of the free Stales for the sacrifices of civil war
and the preservation of tbe National life. It
is to the eternal honor and glory of DouglÂ«s
that when the war broke out the partisan be
came a patriot and gave to his life-long antag
onist. President Lincoln, his unqualified sup
port.
The famous controversy over the "house
divided against itself," nowheie discussed
more bitterly than here on this platform,
ended at Appomattox. The house did not fab,
but it did become "all free." The New South,
the peopled West, the enriched East and the
prosperous North can calmly review the is
sues which so radically divided them in the
past and reverently thank God that in the final
conflict and its settlement the leaderof the
forces of union and liberty was the great
hearted, broad-souled, wise-brained man of
love and country â Abraham Lincoln.
Hon. Robert T. Lincoln delivered a brief
address, whic;i was followed by the un
veiling of the tablet. The tablet is of
bronze with raised letters, and is about
18x24 inches in size. The inscription com
memorative of the debate is as follows:
This memorial tablet is placed here to recall
the joint debate between Abraham Lincoln
and Stephen A. Douglas, whose words these
walls echoed October 7, 1858.
"Equality among tbe different States is a
cardinal principle upon which all our institu
tions rest."â Douglns.
'â¢He is blowing out the moral lights around
us who contends that whoever wants slaves
has a right toÂ«hold tnem."â Lincoln.
The unveiling address was then deliv
ered by Senator Palmer.
After the exercises a reception was held
at the college until 6 o'clock, and to-night
the greatest political demonstration of the
year was held in honor of Chauncey M.
Depew, who addressed a crowd of 10,000
in the larze tent recently erected by the
Republicans. Preceding the address there
was a parade participated in by 5000 peo
ple from different parts ot the country.
Mr. Depew spoke for more than two
hours. The speech from beginning to end
was a most logical one. The speaker was
frequently interrupted by applause and he
arraigned Mr. Bryan and some of his
statements regar.line the benefits of free
silver to the workingman of the country.
The address was one of the best ever de
livered in this city.
RESUMING WORK AT LEADVILLE.
Fortifications Nearly Completed â Imported
Men Are Daily Arriving â No
Show for Union Miners.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Oct. 7.â With all
possible speed the managers of the big
mines are completing their fortifications
and making preparations to resume work.
Tney are going to operate tbe mines
against all combined resistance of the
other side and positively assert that no
man who insists on being a member of the
union can find employment on their
properties.
Tney say they have had applications
from quite a number of them, who on ac
count of active connection with the union
fiave been refused. But the union is help
ing them out on this line, and union officers
are using every means to keep not only
union, but non-union men away from the
mines. The Little Johnny has sixty men
at worK to-day, the Emmett about ninety,
the B son and Chip about thirty, tne
Mahala fifteen and the Resurrection fif
teen. Another lot of men are being im
ported and likely to arrive Friday, but no
definite information can be learned.
TWO MONSTER PARADES.
How Chicago Proposes to Celebrate the
Bit fire Anniversary.
CHICAGO. 111., Oct 7.â From every
indication the Chicago day parades will
be the greatest pageants of their kind, or
in point of numbers of any kind, ever seen
in this city, noted as it is for civic and
military demonstrations.
Chicago day, which commemorates the
burning of the city, is to be celebrated on
Friday, the twenty-filth anniversary of
the great tire*, by a stupendous parade of
Republicans and anti-silver Democrats in
tbe morning and afternoon, and another
demonstration by the Democrats and
other advocates of free coinage of silver in
the evening.
The first parade is to start at 10 o'clock,
and it is estimated that seven hours will
be required for tbe marchers to pass a
given point, although the marching will
be in close order and at a rapid pace.
The night parade is expected to vie
with that of the gold advocates in point of
numoerand enthusiasm, so there will be
little cessation of music and cheering
hosts from early morning till late at
night. On a stand in front of the Palmer
Hotel the Presidential candidates of the
Indianapolis convention will be seated.
It is confidently predicted that the
strangers in tbe city will exceed in num
ber even the crowds that thronged
Chicago during the World's Fair.
VE NUS AND MERCURT.
Interesting Ditcoveries Made at the
Lowell Observatory.
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 7.â An official dis
patch from Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff,
Ariz., announces that the astronomers
there have discovered that the planets
Mercury and Venus rotate each of them
on its axis during its revolution around
the sun. These planets have each of them
therefore only one day in each of their
years.
The Lowell observers find further that
Venus is not cloud covered, as has been
supposed, but has about it a thick atmos
phere, while Mercury as none. -

Heavy Democratic Losses
Shown in the Florida

A Falling Off of 8000 Votes
Since the Election Two
Years Ago.
KENTUCKY VEERING AROUND.
Republicans Make Large Gains in
the Registrationâ The Georgia
Election.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 7.â Official
returns from tbe State election are just
coming in, the count, owing to the length
of the ballot, not being completed in the
larger counties until this afternoon. The
returns indicate a very light vote and a
heavy Democratic loss as compared with
1892.
Complete returns from thirteen out of
145 counties give Eloxhani (D.) for Gov
ernor, 8788; Gunby (R.) for Governor,
2044 ; Weeks (Pop. ) for Governor, 820. The
same counties in 1892 gave Mitchell (D.)
11,629 and Baskins (Pop.) 1391. If the
same ratio obtains in other counties the
Democratic vote will be about 24.G00, a loss
of about 8000 as compared with 1892.
Nineteen counties complete give Bloi
ham (D.) 13,945. Gunby, (R.) 4,220 and
Weeks (Pod) 1822. The same counties in
1892 gave Mitchell (D.) 10,011, Baskin
(Pop.) 2714. _
GEORGIA'S ELECTION.
Democrats Believed to Have Carried Tom
Watson's Uistric'.
ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. 7.â Reports to the
Constitution from all parts of the State
indicate that Atkinson's (D.) majority
for Governor will exceed 35,000, with the
possibility that it will go over 40,000. The
majority for the remainder of the State
ticket will largely exceed that of Atkinson.
Atkinson's loss as compared with the
remainder of the State ticket this year is
attributable to several complications. In
the first place, his opponent, Wright, made
a vigorous personal campaign against
him, appealing to Prohibitionists, Atkin
son having made a local campaign.
Reports from every section of the State
show largely increased Democratic ma
jorities over the votes of two years ago.
Fulton County, in which Atlanta is lo
cated, will give Atkinson 11,000 majority,
and his majority in tbJs Congressional
district will be nearly 5000. The Demo
cratic majority in Richmond County will
be over 3000.
Reports indicate that the Democrats
have carried the Tenth District, whicti is
the stronghold of Populism in Georgia,

for Vice-President, living in this district
In an election riot at El Norton this

GREAT REPUBLICAN GAINS.
Healthy Indication* From the Registra
tion Ihroughout Kentucky.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 7.â Returns
from the first two day's general registra
tion show great Republican gains.
Especially is this true in Louisville and
the larger towns of the State, it is an
easy matter to get the preferences of voters
in this State owing to the primary law.
In order to participate in primaries each
voter when he registers mast declare his
party affiliations. The silver and the goid
Democrats are each registering as "Demo
crats," so their separate strength cannot
be estimated. In this city the Republi
cans lead in every ward except the
Seventh. Frankfort, the State capital,
gives a Republican increase of ninety-nine
over last year. The reeistration closes to
morrow evening at 9 o'clock.
REED SPEAKS AT BOSTON.
Compares the 'Silver Agitation With the
Greenback Craze That Upset the
Country in 1878.
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 7.â A grander pub
lic meeting was never held in Boston than
that which greeted Hon. Thomas B. Reed
in Mu3ic Hall to-night. Not only was
every sect taken, but the aisles were oc
cupied as much as the police would per
mit. The occasion of tbe demonstration
was the ratification of tbe Republican
ticket. Henry Cabot Lodge and Acting
Governor Wolcott were the speakers an
nounced. The presiding officer was W. C.
Lovering of Taunton. He introduced as
the first regular speaker of the evening
Acting Governor Wolcott, who was
cordially greeted.
Acting Governor Wolcott was followed
by Senator Lodge, who was given a hearty
reception. Hon. Thomas B. Reed was the
last speaker. He said in part:
We do not need to talk of protection, for this
country by three elections, each more decisive
than the "other, has practically decided that
ques'ion. But the main question now before
us is the silver question. Even Mr. Bryan
calls a truce on the tariff, though he earnestiv
desired and vigorously fougtit for a worse one
than we now have. This discussion we are
now having is born and bred in the depressed
condition of public and private affairs.
It has cone upon us .ike the greenback agi
tation of 1878. It had the same causes, and in
my judgment will have the same fate. With
the rising tide of business in 1879, which fol
lowed specie resumption, greenbackism dis
appeared from the face of the eurth, perhaps
never again to reappear. In like manner
when this election is over and business re
vives, this question of free coinage of shyer
by the United Btates single-handed and alone
will disappear from public and private dis
cussion.
We may safely argue the money question
upon the fact that what the Chicago candi
dates and platform ask us to do is to leave the
gold standard, not for a double standard, but
for another single standard, and that a lower
one.
What will be the effect while we are doing
it? All debts will shrink and therefore all
debtors will be happy. All creditors are rich
men, else why do they- lend money? And all
debtors are poor men, el&e why do they bor
row money?
The life insurance companies which do busi
ness in New York have accumulated for the
benefit of policy-holders and their beneficia
ries $1,142,000,000. an amount $16,000,000
greater than the National debt. How can such
companies pay the beneficiaries in any money
they do not get themselves? Eight millions
and a half of men are insured in thirty-five
companies alone. Nearly 2,000,000 more are
insured in the small benefit associations. This
beautiful business of reducing debts one-half
will strike 10,000,000 men. Worse than that;
in time it will strike 30,000.000 women and
children.
Regarded a* a Joke.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Oct. 7.â Secretary of
State Piper to-day allowed the convention
of alleged Republicans, who "believe in
the principles of Fremont and Blame, to
be filed. This means that the names will
<*o on the ballot. A protest will be hied
by the Republicans. The matter is re
earded as a joke.

Cold, Drizzling Rain Fails to
Dampen the People's
Enthusiasm.
Nicholas Lays the First Stone of
the B idge to Bear His
Father's Name.
NCIDENTS OF THE CEREMOHY.
Their Majesties Showered With Gifts
and Flowers by Officials and
Maidens-
PARIS, Fbance, Oct. 7.â A cold, drizz
ling rain fell throughout the forenoon, but
despite the discomfort of being out of
doors thousands of people assembled in
the vicinity of the Itussian embassy,
borjing to catch a glimpse of the imperial
Visitors.
President Faure, with Mme. Faure and
Mile. Faure, drove to the Russian embassy
at 9 o'clock this morning for the purpose
of accompanying the Czar and Czarina in
their sight-seeing tour of the city.
The Czar expressed the thanks of him
self and the Czarina for the courtesy
shown to them by the President and his
family, and invited M. Faure to occupy a
seat in his landau. The party started on
their trip half an hour behind the time
fixed by the programme. The Carina
wore a gray dress and looked bright and
fresh, but the Czar looked pale and wore a
serious expression.
The party was driven to the Cathedral
of Notre Dame, where they were received
by Cardinal Richards, Archbishop of
Paris, who was clad in his archiepiscopal
robes. Assisting the Cardinal in the re
ception of the visitors were the Vicar-
General of the archdiocese and the mem
bers of the Maroponitan Chapter. Tne
streets through which the party passed
were lined with people, and the great
square fronting the cathedral was densely
packed. The enthusiasm of the people
along the route and in the square was
manifested by almost incessant cheering.
The Czar and Czarina, after leaving the
cathedral, visited the Palais de Justice,
the Pantheon and the Hotel dcs Invalides,
returning to the Russian embassy for
luncheon. In the afternoon the Czar laid
the first stone of the new bridge across the
Seine, to be known as the Alexander 111
bridge, in honor of the late Czar of Russia,
father of Nicholas 11. The weather was
snowery. The Czar while at tne Pantheon
paid a visit to the tomb of the late Presi
dent Carnot, upon whicti his Majesty
placed a magnificent wreath of while
flowers. Mme. Carnot and her sons were
present.
The Czar and Czarina left the embassy
at 12:45 o'clock and reached the site of the
Pont de Alexandre 111 at 3 o'clock. M.
Boucher, Minister of Commerce, welcomed
the Czar and Czarina and President Faure,
all oi whom stood under a marquee. Sun
ehine broke through the clouds as the
military band struck up the Russian an
them, at the conclusion of which the Eu
fants de Lutece sang the "Soldiers'
Chorus" from "Faust." M. Mounet
Sully then recited M. Herides' splendid
ode of welcome to the Paix et Rodur.
A coffer containing an account of the
laying of the foundation stone of the
bridge Alexander 111 and some coins
whicn were struck off at the mint to-day
were presented to the Czar. Another
coffer with similar contents was then
placed in the cavity which had been
formed for its reception in the 18,000 kilo
grame foundation block of granite which
had been placed upon truck-mounted rails
and the cavity closed with a plate of pol
ished granite ornamented with a pair of
steel rings.
The Czar and Czarina and President
Faure then left the tribune in which they
stood, M. Boucher guiding them. M.
Boucher presented a trowel and hammers
to the Czar and Czarina, who successively
struck blows upon the plate, closing the
cavity in the stone. A squad of sailors
then hoisted the French and Russian
colors upon the mast above the marquee,
while the guns of the Hotel dcs Invalides
thundered a salvo of twenty-one guns.
The military bands played, while fiom
the left bank of the Seine a berlowered
boat started, conveying forty maidens
with a present to the Czarina of a chiseled
silver vase enriched with jewels and a
magnificent bouquet.
An immense crane hoisted the founda
tion-stone and lowered it into place, while
the Czar and Czarina resumed their places
on the tribune. M. Boucher read the
minutes oi the function, which the Czar
signed first, the Czarina next and finally
President Faure.
While the forty maidens were landing
from their boats, the Enfants de Lutece
chanted "France, France." The maidens
then approached the Czarina and pre
sented tiieir sifts. Her Majesty accepted
them and expressed her admiration
of tbe presents, at the same thanking the
maidens with the peculiar grace which has
already won the hearts of all Parisians.
The procession was re-formed at 4 o'clock
amid the mingled strains of the Russian
authem and the Marseillaise and the cheers
of the crowd. The route to the mint was
thronged with wildly cheering people who
had preserved their good nature and
patience despite tbe hours they had
waited for tbe appearance of the Russian
visitors, the procession being at that time
an hour behind the time fixed by the pro
gramme.
After their visit to the academy the
Czar and Czarina proceeded to the Hotel
de Vilie, where M. Baudin, President of
the Municipal Council, received them. M.
Baudin read an address expressing the
wishes of the people for the welfare of
their majesties and rendering on behalf of
the city of Paris the homage dictated by
traditions, love of country and faith in the
destinies of the two great friendly nations.
The Czar replied to M. Baudin's ad
dress, briefly thanking him, as the repre
sentative of the city, for the good wishes
expressed. After an inspection of the
chief halls, including the court of honor,
which was carpeted with fresh flowers and
mervelously decorated, the Czar and
Czarina at 6 o'clock took their departure
for the Russian embassy, amid the en
thusiastic cheers of the crowds. Almost
all tbe municipal officials were present at
the reception.
The welcoming of the imperial visitors
could not have been more hearty if the
crowds had been composed of monarchists
instead of socialists.
During the visit the Czar conferred the
decoration of the Grand Cordon of St.
Anne upon the Prefect of the Seine.
This evening their majesties were enter
tained at a erand banquet by President
Faure and other officials of the Govern
ment at the embassy, at the conclusion
of which they were driven to the Tneater
Francais. where M. Mounet recited M.
Claretie's"Welcome,"after which Musset's
comely "Caprice" was performed, fol
lowed by a scene from "The Cid."
The performance concluded with one
act of "Les Ferames Savantes." The
theater was beautifully decorated with
bunting and flowers, and a large and
brfcliant assemblage was present.
At the conclusion of the performance
the Czar and Czarina returned to the
Russian em bass v.

ALBERT CASTLE'S CASE,
Police Say They Found the
Missing Furs in His
Trunks.
A Private Dispatch Says He Will Be
Released From Custody To-
Day
LONDON, Eng., Oct. B.â There is an air
of considerable mystery about the case o
Walter Michael Castle, the American mer
chant, Ella Castle, his wife, and Fred
Castle, his son, who were arrested yester
day at the Hotel Cecil and were charged
with stealing several sable and chinchilla
skins from furriers.
The manager of the Hotel Cecil said
that the Castles arrived there on Septem
ber 26 from the Continent. There had
been nothing in their conduct which was
noteworthy or suspicious. They seemed
to be the quietest and most respectable
kind of people.
No further charges have been preferred
aeainst the Castles, nor have the police
identified them with any shop thieves
known in London. The police confess
themselves much puzzled by the case.
The evidence against them seeras to be
confined to the fact that they had
entered the shops of the complainants
and after examining the furs had gone
away without buying any. The furriers
missed the goods immediately afterward
and told the police, who say that they
found the missing articles, to ether with
much jewelry and some old hand-painted
china, in the Castle trunks at the Hotel
Cecil.
WILL BE FREE TO-DAY.
News Received Here That Wai
M. Castle Will Be Released
at Once.
Colonel Albert E, Castle has received a
dispatch from London bringing the news
that Walter M. Castle, who was arrested
in London, will be released to-day. Yes
terday cablegrams were sent by Governor
Budd to Hon. Patrick Collins. United
States Consul-General at- London, and to
United Btates Minister Bayard requesting
them to befriend Mr. Castle, and a dis
patch was also sent to Secretary of State
O ney at Washington. The dispatches ran
as ioilows: "I vouch for the respectability
and high standing of Walter M. Castle
and family, citizens of this State, arrested
in London, and request your best offices
in their behalf." This was signed, "James
H. Budd, Governor of California." OBcar
S. Straus, ex-United States Minister to
Constantinople, has communicated with
Minister Bayard from New York.
There is no doubt entertained here that
the arrest of Mr. and Mrs. Castle was
based on a mistake.
P rote at of Seed Merchants.
WASHINGTON, D. C, October 7.â ln
the District Court here to-day, Judge Cox
presiding, the case of D. M. Ferry & Co. of
Detroit, Mich., seeking to enjoin the agri
cultural department from purchasing and
distributing seed was argued, counsel for
plaintiff contending that tne act ol Con
gress under which such distribution is
made is unconstitutional and is disas

way and winning the race.

judges declared her distanced. Burris and
many others claimed tbat there was no
distance flag out and that none had been
announced. The judges â F. P. Wicker
stiam, W. M. Hughes and Lee Shaneyâ
remained firm in their ruling, and Burris
became abusive. He told them that they
could not rule sheep, whereupon he was
ruled off the track. * It is understood that

CRIMEA HILL'S
BANDIT CAUGHT
Tuolumne County Deputy
Sheriffs Effect His
Capture.
CJeverly Trailed From the Scene
of the Oakdale Stage
Robbery.
ADMITS THAT HE IS GUILTY-
The Booty H* Secured Believed to
Have Been Sunk iv a
River.
SONORA, Cal. Oct. 7.â Deputy Sheriffs
Lee Price of Sonora and James Donohue
of Jamestown lodged in jail to-night the
lone highwayman who robbed the Oak
dale stage early Tuesday morning at Cri
mea Hill.
As soon as tbe news of the hold-up was
received here the two officers started out
in pursuit of the robb r. Arriving at the
scene of the hold-up they made a thor
ough search of the ground and finally
struck a trail, which they supposed, and
rightly so, to be that of the stage robber.
This they followed until they reached
Dom Pedro's Bar. Up to this point the
robber had worn moccasins, but here, for
some reason, he saw fit to discard them.
He crossed the river and continued his
flight along the La Grange dam for some
ten miles, when he arrived at the town of
La Grange. There he bought a pair of
shoes and continued his journey, but was
found by the officers in an abandoned
tunnel on the banks of the Tuolumne
River.
When arrested, the fugitive denied hav
ing been near the scene of the robbery, but
he admitted while on his way to Sonora
that he was the man wanted, adding that
he had had a partner in the hold-up. This
is not believed, as there were no tracks at
any place along the route taken by the
robber to indicate that two men had
passed that 'way.
The prisoner was lodged in jail. He
gave as his name Lee Brown. He is a Ger
man about 25 years of age, and has been
seen around here quite recently. When
arrested he had but $5 on his person,
and it is supposed that he has cashed the
remainder of his booty, as it is learned
tbat he got at least $100 from Wells-
Fargo's box. Besides this cash and some
cartridges, nothing was found on him.
He admits having sunk in the Tuolumne
River a parcel, the contents of which are
believed to be some of tiie letters taken
from the mail pouch.
At the scene of the daring crime a num
ber of letters have been picked up, as well
as several checks, which of course were
useless to the robber. Wells- Fargo's box
was also found with one side broken in,
but none of its contents has so far been
recovered.

PARKHURST'S BODY AT U RIAH.
Testimony at Ihe Inquest Indicates That
Death Resulted From Lack of
Medical Attendance.
UKIAH, Cal., Oct. 7.â The body of W.t
H. Paikhurst, the young man who died
last Saturday at Westport, in this county,
while traveling through the conntr with
what is known as the "gospel wagon," in
which a body of religions workers is tour
ing the State, was brought here last even
ing by Albert Albrecht, a relative of the
deceased by marriage. The entire force of
tie gospel band accompanied the body.
Upon its arrival here the corps was taken
to the undertaking parlors ot Eversole <fc
Templeton, where it now lies, and is be
ing prepared for snipment to San Fran
cisco, en route to Berkeley, the home of
the boy's mother.
The inquest held this morning before
Coroner J. H. Barker was conducted by
District Attorney G. A. Sturtevant. The
testimony showed beyond a question that
if proper care had been given the young
man lie would have recovered from what
at the first was only a slight indisposition,
caused by an over indulgence in fruit.
The various members of the "gospel
band," and who in tact attended the lad
in his last iilness, stated their disbelief in
the taking of medicine, and declared that
such were also the views heid by young
farkhurst. One of the members stated
that his ideas were that one should trust
in the Lord and pray for relief, and if this
did not come, then to resort to medical
attendance.
Parkhurst's brother, aged about 20 years,
is also a member of the gospel band. He
appeared to be very enthusiastic in the
work in which he is engaged, and stated
it as his belief that medicine should not
be used in cases of sickness, but that his
mother held views directly opposed to
those of himself and his deceased brother.

pendent Order of Good Templars, con

Worthy Cnief Templar Webb presiding.
The special committee on literature re
ported as follows:
Your committee, to whom was referred the
matter of publication of the Rescue, respect
fully submits the following: Believing it to
be impracticable to attempt to represent our
work and cause solely through journals de
voted to other issues or other lines of temper
ance work we do recommend:
Firstâ That the Rescue be published as in
the past under the direction of the grand sec
retary ns a monthly.
Secondâ That the subscription price be
placed at 35 cents per annum.
Thirdâ That a special canvasser be appointed
by tho chief templar of each lodge at the be
ginning of the term to secure subscriptions.
Fourthâ We further recommend that each
lodge be requested to subscribe for five or
more copies out of their general fund, to be
distributed under the direction of the good of
the order committee to those not members of
the order.
Fifthâ That the literature committee of this
Grand Lodge be requested to furnish the grand
secretary at least one page of matter each
issue regarding the "educational course" and
such other matter as they may deem of inter
est to tho order.
An amendment that the price of the
paper be placed at 25 cents per annum and
that the grand secretary appoint associate
editors throughout toe jurisdiction was
adopted.
Toe subject that occupied the attention
of the Grand -Lodge this afternoon was tbat
of placing tiie government of tbe Orphans'
Home in the hands of an executive com
mittee. It was after 6 o'clock before the
session had ended and the question was
still undecided. A literary bureau was
formed and the grand chief templar and
grand secretary were empowered to place
lecturers in the field to advance the in
terests of the order. The Grand Lodee
voted to return to the old county system
in mission work of the order. This work
is now accomplished by nine districts of
five counties each. It was claimed that
much better results were obtained where

ing was held in the Baptist Church.
PASADENA'S FIRE-FIGHTERS.
futile Attempt to Chech the flames on
Browns Mountain.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct 7.â Forest fires
are seen on the fiont range of the Sierra
Madre again to-night. The flames are
several miles from the Mount Lowe prop
erty, with a canyon intervening, so there
is no immediate danger, and as the County
Supervisors are to send twenty-five men
up to-morrow morning they will probably
be able to check the conflagration.
The ten men who went up Browns
Mountain yesterday from this city did not
succeed in checking the flames. They
could get no water up there and the blind
ing, suffocating heat and smoke was too
much for them. They came down to
night, leaving the fire on the front range
burning. The other men are several miles
back, fighting the fire on the other side.
The Tejunca. fires seem to be working
west. The San Gabriel Canyon fiie is
greater than yesterday, and is now only
a few miles above Azusa. Nothing has
been done to check it.

DISCOVERS THE REMEDY.
A Public Test Will Be Made To-Day at
Bryan's Drugstore. -
In the wonderful progress made by
medical science : ; of I the -world successful
treatment for most diseases has been dis-
covered, and _ those which were at one
time considered incurable are now easily
conquered. Among the most difficult and
obstinate of diseases which has baffled the
skill of our most noted \ Physicians up to
the present time Asthma ranks first.
Thousands of sufferers know, by their per-
sonal experience that no absolute cure for
this disease was discovered until Dr. Ru-
dolph Schiffraann, the renowned Physi-
cian, ... who has made the treatment of
Asthma and " kindred complaints the
study of a lifetime, during which time he
has treated > and â  cured more > cases ' of
Asthma than any living Doctor,' perfected
a remedy, whicn not only produces instant
relief in the most severe cases of Asthma,
Hay.Fever and Bronchitis, but has posi-
tively cured ; thousands of sufferers who
were considered incurable.' ' Recognizing;
the skepticism of the public in this age of
countless fraudulent nostrums, Dr. Schiff-
mann, in order to ') restore confidence 'and
obviate any suspicion of imposition, re-
quests this paper to announce tuat from 8
a. m. to-day until 6 p. m. to-morrow he
offers a liberal sample box of Schiffmann's
Asthma Cure to all persons applying at
William J. Bryan's drugstore, under
Grand Hotel, absolutely free of charge,
knowing that a personal test will be most
convincing, and will vindicate his every
claim. This Physician has made a most

vited to call, and should bear in mind the

HORSE-WHIPPING
AT SANTA CRUZ
Mrs. Catherine Mackenzie
Lashes Superior Judge
Logan.
Sensational Encounter on One of
the City's Principal
Streets.
REVIVES AN OLD SCANDAL.
Bitterness Engendered by a Divorce
Suit in Which the Woman
Was Cc-Respoadrnt.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. 7.â Superior
Judge Logan and Mrs. Catherine Macken
zie were the principals in a sensational
horse-whipping episode here to-night, the
woman wielding the whip. The assault
was the outgrowth of the old Dr. Stewart
divorce scandal, when Judge Logan ap
peared as a witness for the wife and
against Mr?. Mackenzie, who was named
as corespondent in the suit.
The Judge was walking up Pacific ave
nue when Mrs. Mackenzie, who had been
lying in wait around the corner on Church
street, came hurriedly out aud drew from
under her cloak a email cart whip, with
a stock two feet long and plaited buckskin
lash. She tried to strike Judge Logan
upon the shoulders.
The Judge, who is a well-knit, powerful
man, caught the force of the blow on his
uplifted hand, and the whip was taken
away from the- infuriated woman by
Officer Horton, who witnessed tbe assault.
Judge Logan quietly turned away and
entered his buguy, which had been or
dered to take him into the country. The
officer arrested Mrs. Mackenzie and took
her to Justice Gardner's court, where,
after detaining her awhile, she was al
lowed to go. Judge Logan had no knowl
edge that she was actually under arrest,
and consequently made no complaint.
Mrs, Mackenzie came to Santa Cruz in
1889 with Dr. Stewart and located on Etha
Hill, eight miles|from the city. They passed
in the best society as brother and sister.
In IS9O there appeared upon the scene at
Etha Hill a Mrs. Stewart, who proved her
self the wife of Dr. Stewart. A bombshell
falling in ScnU Cruz society circles could
not bsve caused a greater sensation than
when Mr?. Stewart made grave charges of
infidelity, and claimed that the doctor and
Mrs. Mackenzie were not brother and sis
ter. The scandal was widespread, and
consequently caused their ostracism from
society.
Two months after the wife appeared Dr.
Stewart sought a divorce. Up to this time
Judge Logan nad maintained the most
friendly relations with Dr. Stewart and
Mrs. Mackenzie, who both looked to the
Judge for moral support in the suit. Dr.
Stewart, just befce brinaing his action,
transferred the Etba Hill vineyard and
ranch, with other property, to Mrs. Mac
kenzie. Judge Locan then refused to side
with them and took the part of the wife,
whom, he believed, was the aggrieved
party.
The suit was eventually dismissed. The
wife then instituted a suit for divorce,
alleged statutory grounds, and Mrs.
Mackenzie as co-respondent. The suit wa?
tried before Jndge Breen, sitting in Judge
Logan's court, and the latter gentleman
appearing as a witness for the wife. The
suit was won by Mrs. Stewart, and in 1595
a decree of divorce was granted, the court
holding that Dr. Stewart and Mrs. Mack
enzie were not brother and sister. The
denial of a new trial was made last Satur
day.
Since the decision in 1395 Mrs. Macken
zie has given proof of a bitter feeling
against Judge Logan, which culminated
to-day in the personal assault upon him.
EXPLOSION AT SANTA CRUZ.
Qrinding-Mill in the California Powder
Works Wrecked â No Loss of
Life.
SANTA CRVZ, Caju. Oct. 7.â An explo
sion at the California Powder Works, two
miles above this city, this morning at 2:30
o'clock, destroyed the roof and siding of
a single wheel grinding-mill. but resulted
in no injury to employes. The mill was
running on fuse powder, which requires
three hours' time, other powder requiring
from iour to twelve hours, according to
character and quality. The two men em
ployed at this mill are required to be in
the mill only at certain times to start or
s-top the machinery, ana at the time of
this explosion they were at a safe distance.
No cause can be assigned for the acci
dent, as nothing was left of the com
position in the process of grinding, and
there was no impairment of tbe machinery
sufficient to show irregularity of its oper
ation. The framework, built of timbers
ten inches square, stands there this morn
ing naked as the day it was first con
structed. The roof, sides and every light
piece of wood were blown out in chunck3
and spiinters. One door was lodged in a
tree fifty feet high. The bed in which the
grinding wheels were run was damaged
considerably, but the pair of wheels,
weighing seven tons, still stand as firm as
though no accident had occurred.
The debris and framework caught fire
after the explosion, but the watchmen and
workmen quickly responded and soon
quenched it. The building stands isolated
irom the others among the trees, so danger
to the other buildings from fire was slight.
The report of the explosion was plainly
heard in all parts of the city.
THUSSERY AT PORTLAND.
Key holes of Fire-Alarm Boxes Repeatedly
Pluggedâ lncendiary Conflagrations
Feared. .
PORTLAND, Oil, Oct Chief of Police
Robertson and the Police Department
have been greatly annoyed by the plug
ging of keyholes of fire-alarm boxes and a
â harp lookout is being kept for those en
gaged in this mischief. Several men are
under suspicion and if detected it will go
hard with them, as the plugging of a key
hole in a fire-alarm box is a penitentiary
offense. Chief of Police Robertson dees
not presume to say who the guilty parties
are, but among the members of the police i
force it is hinted that they might tÂ» dis- i
charged employes of the Fire Department,
who are doing this In order to hamper the
work of their successors and bring odium
upon the administration in the event of a
fire. * It is claimed that it is this effort on
the tvurt of some one to injure the working
of the Fire Department that has caused
the .Police Commissioners to decide upon
an increased police force. .
The situation hen with regard to fires
â¢ is a very delicate one nnd insurance com-
I pnnies nre In a quandary which way to
turn. There is such a hostile sentiment
against the reo^piuiizeil Fire Department
that incendiary tiros are incessantly men

GRANGERS VISIT FOLSOM.
Inspect the Prison and the Orange^ ale
Orchards â A Social at the
Capitol.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., Oct. 7. â The
members of the State Grange and their
invited guests spent the day at Folsom,
visited the prison, drove through the or
chards of Oraneevale, inspected the mine-;,
feasted and danced in the grove adjoin
ing the town, and returned to this city at
an early hour this evening on their special
train.
Tue grange reconvened in the Senate
Chamber of tbe Capitol building to-night
and listened to an able adilress delivered
by E. P. McCabe, :>ecretnry to Governor
lUnld. It had been expected that the Gov
ernor would be present and address the
members, but he was detained elsewhere.
The grange was assured by his representa
tive tbat the Governor was with it in any
proposition which would add to its pros
perity, and would give any aid in his
power to promote legislative enactments
which won id be to its advantage.
W. W. Greer, master of the grange,
responded in an eloquent speech. One of
the pleasing features of the evening's pro
gramme was a flower dance, performed
by six beautiful young ladies attired in
colonial costume* who sang as they
danced of tbe fruit and flowers of golden
California. The figures of the dance were
somewhat similar 10 the colonial minuet.
SAN JOSE'S CHINESE FEUD.

Supervisorial District Boundary Changes
A route s >"iÂ»ror.
SANTA BARBARA, Cvt., Oct. 7-â A
lively tilt occurred to-day in the County
Supervisors' chambers over the recent
change made by that body in the boun
daries of the supervisorial district, by
which the Second District, comprising
the city of Santa Barbara, received a big
slice from the Third District, including
that popuioas settlement known as Hope
precinct. A petition signed by many citi
zens was presented to the board, protest
ing against this change, and it has been
openly charged that the division was
made for the express pumose of securing
Edward de la Cuesta's re-election from the
Third District.
The petition to restore the former di
vision lines of the district received little
attention from the board beyond an ap
peal to District Attorney Oglesby to as
certain whether its action in the matter
had been legal. Mr. Oglesby's opinion
sustained this action, and here the matter
rests for the present, but Attorney
Butcher, speaking for the petitioners, de
clares that the board has no jurisdiction
in the matter, and that the question will
be appealed to the courts before it will be
abandoned, even if it has to be carried to
the Supreme Court.
I NQUEST AT ROSEBURG.
Ao One Blamed for the Greens Station
JiniUrnu Disaster.
PwOSEBURG, Or., Oct. 7.â The Cor
oner's jury impaneled to investigate the
circumstances of the collision between
two engines at Greens station yesterday
morninjr, by which three trainmen were
killed and four badly injured, completed
it? labors to-day. Several trainmen were
called as witnesses and a mass of evidence
was taken. The jnry spent hoars in de
lioeratine, and thÂ«n reported a verdict
that the three trainmen lost their lives by
accident. The jury's verdict was received
with much disfavor, in view of its mild
tone. Part of the verdict states that the
findings do not show any one to blame.
The verdict says in conclusion that the
southbound engine was running under or
ders; that tne northbound engine baa a
right to flag back, as there was no tele
graph station at that point, and it did
comply with the regulations up to the
straight track a mile and a half south of
Greens station, which straight track they
had a right to run over unflacged wben
tdey could see. It being daylight, they
dropped down the straight track with tb'e
intention of flagging through the fog and
around the small curve.

THE SAX IKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1869.
OHIO'S ORATOR
AT LOS ANGELES
General Butterworth Talks
to a Gathering of
Thousands.
Hazard's Pavilion Tco Small to
Seat the Many Who Would
Hear Him.
APPEALS TO SOBER SENSE.
Hon. W. J. Hnnsaker, a Life-Long
Democrat, Presides Over iho
Meeting.
Los Angei.es Office of The Call,)
328 South Broaaway, >
Los Angeles, Cat., Oct 7.)
One of the greatest and most enthusi
astic political meetings ever held in
Southern California was that in Hazard's
Pavilion this evening, under tbe auspices
of the Business Men's Sound Money
League of Los Angeles. The chairman of
the meeting was Hon. John W. J. Hun
saker, an able lawyer and life-long Demo
crat, but now in the ranks of those who
believe in protection, prosperity and an
honest dollar. The great pavilion was
packed with an eager and an attentive
audience, composed of Los Angeles
County's most intelligent citizens. The
principal speech was delivered by Hon.
Ben Butterworth of Ohio. General But
terworth fully sustained his reputation as
an able, logical and eloquent orator. He
held his great audience's closest attention
for over two hours.
General Butterwortb was escorted from
his hotel to the pavilion by the Araericus
Club of Pasadena. The club formed at
Temple and Main streets at 7 o'clock and
marched down Main to Winchester. Here
General Butterworth joined it. The line
of march was then up Fourth to Spring,
on Spring to First, to Broadway, down
Broadway to Fifth and thence to the
pavilion. The pavilion seats 5000 people,
but it was far too small ibr the throngs
which gathered to hear the General's great
speech. Chairman Hunsaker said:
"One of the peculiar features of this
campaign is that one who has always
voted the Democratic ticket should be j
called upon to preside at a meeting to I
further the election of a Republican can
didate for President, but those with whom
I have had life-long political association
have taken up their carpet-ba^s and
walked deliberately into the camp of Pop
ulism.
"There is no place for me in this cam
paign except to stand with the party
which seeks to uphold law and order in
this country."
General Butterworth said in part: "I i
have been in oue State of the Union where
the ladies not only have a voice but a vote j
also and I am unable to see any good rea- \
son why the virgin and the mothershould i
not be as much entitled to vote as the <
man who lays claim to the privilege of
rowdyism."
The speaker then called attention to the
function of government, saying: "It is j
not a proper function of government to !
feed and clothe those who can labor and
do not. We all agree tbat prosperity has !
been banished from the country. It is j
important to be consistent; it is far more j
important to be right. For some reason a
business paralysis rests upon the country.
In 1592, and prior to that time, peace, con
tentment and prosperity iound a place
upon every hearthstone in tbe country.
There was not a man who attended his
flock who was complaining; there was not
a fruit-grower who was complaining;
there was not a wheat-raiser who was
complaining.
"Four years ago tbe Democracy said:
'If you will tnm us we will give you more
prosperity.' The people believed them
and gave them the reins of government.
What waÂ« the result ? We have an object
lesson. To-night all through the land
able-bodied men are walking in despair,
praying tbat the blight Democracy has
brought nrjoo them may pass away. Just
one year after the time we had resolved to
shut the doors of industries against our
selves we discovered our mistake. We
shall decide on the third day of Novem
ber for our weal or woe."
NEED NOT REGISTER AGAIN.
Opinion .on Eligibility of Voters Who Re- !
moved to New Precincts in
Certain Counties.
URIAH, Cal., Oct. 7.â There having
been some â  question raised regarding the
construction of section 1094 of the Political
Code relating to precinct - registration,
County Clerk Hale McGowan has secured
an opinion of Hon. T. L. Carothera on the
question at issue.
From the position taken by this gentle
man it appears that there is no statutory
challenge by which a voter may be pre
vented from voting from failure to chance
his registration, providing he shall have
resided in the precinct in which he may
desire to vote thirty days DreVious to elec
tion. Mr. Carother?, â¢ after : quoting the
section in question, says:
lam of the opinion taut in any event the
above quoted provision of the Political Code
only applies to counties or cities and counties
where, either a new registration is required
before each general election, or where the
Board of Supervisors has canceled the old reg
; ister and ordered a Dew registration. Mendo
cino is not a county where the law requires a
; new registration previous to . each general
election, and the Board -of Supervisors did
not cancel : the old register and order a nevr
registration. By a careful reading of the pro
vision of the code quoted above one will
readily. observe that c&anga of registration
from one precinct to another by reason of re
moval of the voter is only necessary in case
(as far as " Meadocino County is concerned) a
new registration of the electors of the county
has been had. vjnICIWBGBMWW^j
There is nothing in the election laws of this
State that provides that a voter who fails to
have his registration erred from one pre
cinct to another on account jof | removal shall
not be entitled to vote by reason of such fail
; are, and the law does not make it a prerequis
ite to vote that such transfer is made.
. * â¢ â¢ >It is. therefore, my opinion that a
voter is entitled to vote â¢ in Mendocino County
at the coming: election in the precinct where
; he has resided for thirty days prior to the
; election, regardless as to whether or not be
may have had his registration changed from
' one precinct to another by reason of removal.
ORATORY AT SANTA ANA.
General Rutterxeorth, Senator Perkins
and Colonel Jackson Speak.
SANTA ANA, Cal., Oct. 7.â This has
been a great Republican day for Orange
Couflty. Senator George C. Perkins and
Colonel J. P. Jackson of San Francisco
and the renowned Ben Butterworth of
Ohio favored this city with their presence.
Local Republicans received them in royal
style, a committee of prominent citisens,
with the Santa Ana band, meeting the
visitors at the depot this morning and
escorting them to the hotel. Business
bouses were gayly decorated and pictures
of McKinley were conspicuous in a num
ber of windows.
At 1:30 o'clock a parade formed to escort
1 the speakers to thÂ» open-air stand east of j
the county offices, where tbe meeting was
held. Two bands were in attendance. The
escort consisted of about 100 members of
the Union Veterans' Patriotic League and
300 memb?rs of the Santa Ana, Tustin ana
Orange McKinley citibs. The audience
which aÂ»Â»enibled to hear the arguments
numbered nbout 2000.
John W. Ballard, candidate for Superior
Judge, officiated as chairman, and first
introduced General Bu'terwortn, who was
received with preat applause, rle spoke
for an hour and a hall, ana although pain
fully out of voice made a forcible speech,
confining himself principally to 'tariff.
His arguments for protection were Jogical
and convincing and illustrated witb hu
morous and effective comparisons.
Referring to silver, he said he was an
ardent bimetallism but that our statutes
alone could not regulate the commercial
price of any product. Therefore he was
not in favor of free coinage except by in
ternational agreement, which the Repub
lican party was pledged to promote. ' He
closed with a handsome tribute to Senator
Perkins, and was given three hearty
cheers.
Senator Perkins delivered a short ad
dress, which was accorded close attention
and frequent applause. The Senator and
Colonel Jackson spokÂ« to-night to a large
audience at French's Opera-bouse.

CONVERTS MADE AT SAN MATEO.
Samuel M. Shortridge Compares Democ
racy's Failures With Republican
Achievements.
SAN MATEO, Cal., Oct. 7.â The great
est Republican demonstration in the his
tory of San Mateo was that of this evening.
Samuel M. Shortridge and Rev. Anna
Shaw were the principal speakers. Mr.
Shortridge's address was eloquent, clear
and convincins, and was frequently inter
rupted by applause.
He spoke of the Republican party's
achievements, comparing its glorious
record with the miserable failure of the
Democracy to guide the ship of state into
anything but the bogs of bond issues and
the quagmire of a National deficit. So
clearly did he demonstrate the need of
protection to the products of the Golden
State and the benefits that would result
trom the election of McKinley that after
the meeting a numbar of old and tried
Democrats announced openly that they
would march to the polls under the
pennons of the Canton statesman.
Miss Shaw made an earnest appeal for
the enfranchisement of her sex and her
address met with tbe seemingly unani
mous approval of her hearers.
The San Mateo McKinley Club and tbe
Woman Suffrage Club attended the meet
ing in a boCy.

the j McKinley . Club (200 ! strong) paraded
the streets, carrying torches above red um
brellas. Many of the leading men of the
town are members of ,ths club and all
turned out in the para^Seu'J^ir'i* i â "-â 
Long ' before the speaker arrived the
space in front of the. rostrum was packed,
fully 2000 people being out to hear the ad
vocate of protection and sound money.
His plea for protection was the best ever
heard here, and he was frequently ap
plauded. The crowd was an earnest one,
and during the two hours that the Jersey
man addressed them it â¢ cave him the
closest attention. No Democratic meet
ing has brought out so large or so intelli
gent an audience.
RED BLUFF RALLY.
Xasterly Addret* Delivered by General
Chiptnan.
RED BLUFF, Cal., Oct. 7.â A large
audience packed the Pavilion to-mpht to
listea to addresses by General N. P.
Cbipman and Frank \V. Smith of Red
ding. Dr. G. W. Westlake was introduced
as p resident of the evening and delivered
an address of twenty minutes' duration,
after which he introduced General Chip
man.
The general delivered one of the most
logical speeches heard here this season.
He read copious extracts from the Con
gressional Record, showing that tre
alleged "crime of 1373" was discussed
fully and was thoroughly understood at
the'timetbe act was passed. He intro
duced a novel feature by having printed
in large letters tables, by which he illus
trated his remarks, thus putting the statis
tics before his hearers in a way visible to
the eye and easily remembered.
After General Chipnian bad finished bis
masterful argument, Frank W. Smith of
Redding made a short speech which was
enthusiastically received. With three
cheers for McKinley and prosperity, the
audience dispersed with a much better
knowledge of the subject than is their
usual portion after tearing a campaign
speech.
RELLY AT LOS GATOS.
The Demcerntir Xotminee Replies to the
Examiner.
LOS GATOS, Cax., Oct. 7.â Hon. Joseph
P. Kelly of Ban Francisco, Democratic
nominee for Congress in the Fifth Dis
trict, and Hon. W. D. Grady of Fresno,
spoke in Masonic Hall last evening to a
large audience.
Mr. Kelly'* remarks were mainly di
rected against the San Francisco Exam
aminer, which paper, he declared, was
guilty of the grossest ill treatment of him
as a Democratic nominee. The speaker
told his audience that he would attack
tbat paper and its proprietors at a meet
ing to be held in Metropolitan Hail, San
Francisco, next Thursday evening, when
he would turn on the X rays on its black
mailing methods and thÂ« character of its
proprietors. Keliy closed bis speech with
an appeal to tbe Democratic voters to
stand by the platform of the party.
Mr. Grady followed witb a talk on free
silver coinage and the fallacies of the Re
publican party according to Democratic
views.
Stockton .Nominee Ineligible.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct 7.â A discovery
was made yesterday which startled the
members of the American Protective As
sociation. It was that tber.arxeof Wil
liam Henry Brigps, the Non- Partisan
American Protective Association candi
date lor tbe Assembly front the Twenty
sixth District, was not on the great regis
ter of San Joaqnin County, and Hence the
gentleman was not eligible to a place on
the ticket. It is said that Briggs was one
of those who objected strenuously to the
county putting the voters to tbe expense
of printing a new great register, and for
that reason be refused to have himself re
registered. He determined to run for the
Assembly, and Have a law passed to pre
vent what he considered reckless extrava
gance.

SUMMEKLAND, CaiÂ», Oct. 7.â An en

MARION DE VEIES' PLIGHT.
Must Go Upon the Ticket as the
Nominee of Independent
Populists.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 7.â From
present appearances the outlook for fusion
between the Democratic and Populist
parties, in as far as the Presidential elec
tors are concerned, is becoming gloomy.
That this fact is evident to the leaders of
these parties is evidenced by the efforts
they are putting forth to compel Secretary
of State Lewis H. Brown to certify to
their chosen candidates under a single
group, which would probably be headed,
should they succeed in their designs,
"People's Party electors; Democratic
electors."
To accomplish this aim proceedings will
be commenced before the Supreme Court
against the Secretary of State immedi
ately, to attempt to compel him to so
group the two parties' electors; and it is
claimed that the silver branch of the
Democratic party will attempt to enjoin
the Secretary of State from certifying to
the nomination of electors of the gold
branch, which are grouped under the head
of '"National Democrats."
A writ of mandate will be served on the
Secretary of State to compel him to place
the name of Marion da Vries on the Con
gressional ticket as nominee of the Peo
ple's party instead of tne Independent
Populist. Should the leaders who have
this matter in hand fail in their endeavors,
Secretary of State Brown will certify to
Presidential electors under the following
heads:
Republican electorsâ lrving M. Scott, Dun
can E. MeKinlay, George M. Francis, Julius
M. Walling, Howell A. Powell, Joseph P. Spear
Jr., Claus Spreckels, Elwood Cooper, Thomas
Flint.
People's party electorsâ J. V. Webster, Daniel
McKay, J. W. Martin, S. I. Aliard, Jo Hamil
ton, D. T. Fowler, William Craig, M. K. Mer
riu, C. Thresher.
Democratic electors â J. W. Martin, Jo Ham
ilton, S. I. AUard, C. \V. Thresher, William
Craisr. D. T. Fowler. M. R. Merrltt, J. V. Web
ster, Dnniel Webster, Daniel McKay.

Bowers, B. F. Taylor, Elam Biggs, Dr. P. Mc-
Cargar, H. H. Luse, Robert Thompson, M. J.

National Democratic electors â Clay W, Tay
lor, Thomas B. Bond, James K. O'Brien, John

son, Johu Roth, Robert Y. Haj-nes. L. B. Hakes.
Socialist Labor electors â Emil Lless, Lemiel

National electors â John Bidwell, Henry
French, F. W. Hooper, R. F. Burns, W. H.
Bone, F. Hilton, "William Kellv, Jesse Yarnell,
J. M. Glass.
Secretary of State Brown said to-night:
"I was called up by telephone this after
noon by Chairman Alford of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, who a*ked
me if 1 intended to group the fusion party
electors under one heading, insteaa of
two. I answered 'So,' tnat as two con
ventions had been he;d and two separate
certificates filed, I would be obliged to so
certify. He inquired if I intended to in
clude the name of the National Demo
cratic electors on the ticket, and I said I
did. He asked me if Marion de Vries'
name would be placed on the Congres
sional ticket a3 nominee of the People's
pÃrty.
"I answered in the negative, as it had
been presented after the time provided
for in the Political Code, and said that I
was the recipient of a certificate presented
to me in the form of a petition under the
name 'Independent Populists.' This is
on file and will be certified by me unless
prevented by a decision of the Supreme
Court.
"Chairman Alford then informed me
that it was their intention to mandamus
me, and inquired If I would come to the
city for the purpose of acknowledging the
service of papers. I was obliged by my
office duties to refuse his request, and he
informed me that the papers would be for
warded to-night ty messenger.
"In my opinion there arÂ« but two pos
sible ways in which fusion can be accom
plished, and that is by one party resigning
its individuality and combining its dele
gates under the other party head, having
the number of delegates from each faction
understood between themselves, or else
for the Democrats to group but five dele
gates under their party heading and the
Populists to group four delegates under
their party head. Grouped as they are,
the same names on separate tickets,
I know of no law wh:ch would authorize
county clerks to add the individual votes
together, as there might be different indi
viduals of similar names under every
party group, and should there be four
different John Jones it certainly would
not be right to give to one John Jones the
vote cast for the oÂ»her three.
"Fusion is certainly a very perplexing
question, and the more I study it the more
complex it becomes."
Up to midnight no messenger had ar
rived in this city wi)h mandamus papers
to be eerved on the Secretary of State, who
waited in his office until that hour and
then retired to bis residence.

1 DRINK AT MEALS.
. An Important Fart. â¢.
The real trouble "with tea and coffee
drinking is not generally understood. It
is, common knowledge with every one
that physicians advise the discontinuance
of both, lea and coffee wUen a person is
sick, particularly when 7 the digestive ma-
chinery, is affected. Any person with a
slight knowledge of chemistry can mate
the : following .: experiments," securing ' the
results . as given. . . ; Coagulated egg albu-
men -when mixed with artificial. gastric
juices will be practically entirely digested
in eight hours.
When tea is added during the process
of digestion 66 | er cent of albumen will be
digested, leaving 34 per cent undigested,
while if ;. a decoction â¢ of : coffee is mixed
with the albumen the re.suits will be but
61 per cent digested and 39 percent undi-
gested. This means one thing, and the
experiment sneaks .that fact plainly.
When tea or coffee is taKen , into the hu-
man stomach they very seriously inter-
lere with the natural and healthful opera-
tion. Where a person has an exceedingly
powerful digestive apparatus he can stand
this abuse for a time, but it is sure to
tell sooner or later. â¢; '.". i >
In addition to the above it may be said
that any ordinary analytical chemist can
analyze coffee 5 and : snow the : poisonous
alkaloids of much the same character as
found in strychnine, whisky, tobacco and
morphine. These poisons have a. direct
effect upon the liver, and a furred tongue,
costive bowels, bad skin and various other
indications r of I approaching sickness '_ are
apparent. " ; These ; facts , have been â¢ recog-
nized by physicians for many years, but it
is difficult to induce people to leave off
their habits even when those habits are
shown to be injurious and to shorten the
existence of the human body.
The manager of La Vita Inn, a health
institution at Battie Creek, Mich., made a
large number of experiments in the direc-
tion of a food drink that would be at once
nourishing, palatable and fraerant, with-
out any of the poisonous or injurious
properties. His experiments were con-
fined :V to compounding and arranging
products of various cereals or grains, such
as were intended by nature for man's sub-
sistence. Being in a position to note
the effect of \ the beverage upon
weak stomachs, and patients ' who
needed the most nourishing food
and drink that could be obtained, his ex-
periments were conducted under* what
would probably be considered the most
favorable circumstances. '' After continued
use and the most positive evidence of the
healthful properties of the food-drink, pa-
tients. who had been healed wished to con-
tinue the use of the cereal drink after their
return to their homes, and others made
demand for It. * â  ' - ;
In order to supply this demand and the
public generally, the Postum Cereal Co.,
Limited, was formed. , All people who
drink coffee and tea do not care to discon-
tinue their use, although quite satisfied of
their hurtful properties. There are enough
people, however," in America who hold
their health in high enough esteem to be
willing to give a little attention to their
food and drink. There is no habit the
creature acquires which produces so much
real enjoyment as the old-fashioned habit
of being thoroughly welL When a man
can inhale a deep breath . of . pure * air and
feel that every part of the machinery of
the human body is working perfectly, the
feeling of comfort produces a deep, sense
of easy content and thankfulness to the
Creator for the mere privilege of living.
> Postum is a thoroughly healthful focd
drink. It can be taKen at each meal by
all members ol the family, including the
children. It quickly ; establishes itself as
an important part of the meal, and when
left out one misses the fragrant odor, the
comforting .flavor* and the health-giving
properties. ,
1 lb. coffee (30 cents) sives 40 to 45 cuds.
1 package Postum (25 cents) gives 100
cups.
. About 3to 1 in favor of Postum. ; .
This item of economy is by no means
the chief consideration. Health, comfort
and red blood speak out strongly for the
natural drink.
This pure food drink brews exactly the
color of the richest coffee and has much
the same fragrance and taste, with none
of the harmful properties. -

H. C WHITEN-G. . B. xTrTAJTGATOR'S JOB HAS
SPRUNG A LEAK
People's Party Men Will
Soon Denounce Him
Openly.
How the Platform Has Eeen
Ruined and the Party
Absorbed.
THE GREAT CRIME OF 1896
Observations on Sentiment Among ths
Massife of the Party by a
Stalwart.
Middle-of-the-road Bopalists are like
the man without a country â they have
nothing to which they can swear alle
giance. They are Populists without a
party. If they vote for municipal officers
they must vote for Buckley's lambs or
else remain away from the polls; if they
wish to vote for members of the Legisla
ture they must mark an X with the
red-rubber stamp opposite the names of
Ramey's lambs. They will vote for tbese,
if at all, with the understanding that the
Democrats put on the ticket by Cator and
Buckley and Rainey will answer the roll
call for Thomas V. Cator, alias Charles
Jones, for United States Senator, and as
Cator is higher than the platform and the
party he must be necessarily higher than
the people, for it would be rank treason to
murmur against the fulfillment of any
bargain made by such political purists as
the three gentlemen named.
Populists are complaining in undertones
because their party has been absorbed by
the Democracy, and it will not be many
days before they will loudly voice those
complaints.
A well-known People's party man said
to a Call reporter yesterday : "1 am dis
gusted with the whole affair and yet I
dare not announce myself because it
would injure me in my business. I was
dissatisfied at the start when the silver
men in the People's party National Con
vention in St. Louis destroyed our plat
â¢orm, which was never intended to be a
temporary affair, but a permanent declara
tion of eternal principles. These were cut
down and obliterated in order that Bryan
and other Democrats who needed our
votes could stand upon it or pretend to
when called upon.
"I noticed tnat Bryan in his letter of
acceptance indorsed the free coinage
plank in the People's party platform, but
did not indorse any other plank. Yet we
are asked to su"pport a man who is neither
of us nor for us, but who is a programme
Democrat from the sole of his foot to the
crown of his head.
"The local fusion farce has made me
even more disgusted. We give Sewall
five electoral votes and Watson four. The
lour votes won't do Mr. Watson any good
because they will be killed by the five for
Bewail. It looks to me as if we bad been
buying a silver brick from a lot of Demo
cratic bunko sharps.
"Then we are asked to vote for Buckley
and Rainey lambs for the municipal and
legislative offices, and such a tough look
ing crowd 1 They should begin a libel
[suit against their countenances, for when
l saw them lined up on the platform I
feit like pulling a police whistle and blow
ing it. If any one had told me a year ago
that a People's party convention would
put up a lot of Buckley lambs for office I
would have called him a liar.
"I was talking with E. 8. Barney the
other day, and he said that it was all
right, because the Buckley lambs had
promised to support the People's party
platform, and that it was a part of the
programme of fusion. You know Barney,
don't you? He's a pretty honest sort of a
fellow, and is running a Populist paper
on Market street callea Voice of .Labor.
He is associated with M. McGlynn, but I
Understand that A. B. Kinne, the fusion
candidate for Congress in the Fifth Con
gr ssional District, owns or has an iron
grip on the type and fixtures of tbe estao
lishment. Kinne, being & candidate,
must stand in with the machine and the
programme, and as the tail goes with the
hide, Barney and McGlynn are for the
programme too.
"I tell you that there will be a big sur
prise for the jobbers on the day after elec
tion. They'll find that while it may be
very easy to put up a job to sell out the
Populists, body, boots and breeches, it's
not so easy to deliver the goods. Some
times the goods kick.
"I know a whole lot of Peoples-party
men who are going to do what I am suing
to do, and that is to vote for Populists
only. We will vote for the four Watson
electors and let the Democrats take care
of Millionaire Sewall. Then we will put a
red cross opposite Montieth's name in the
First Congressional District, and for
Kiune in the Fifth and Barlow and Castle
in the Sixth and Seventh.
"I will not vote for a solitary Demo
cratic candidate for the. Legislature be
cause I know that Rainey put them on the
ticket with the assistance of Cator, and I
believe tbat Rainey is one of the lieuten
ants of the Southern Pacific Company,
and that, therefore, we cannot expect any
i hostile legislation against the corporation
I from that quarter.
* Just think of it! We've been euchred
out of our Mayor. We haven't a candidate
for that office because Mr. Buckleyâ the
same old Chris â wanted one of his Demo
cratic friends there, so I shall have to vote
for Taylor or Dr. O'Donneliâ l haven't
made up my mind which.
"Cator and Wardall seem to think it is
all right. Cator wants to be United States
Senator, and Wardall is drawing down a
century Â«very month in United States
gold coin for acting as chairman of tbe
People's party State Central Committee.
Wardall wants the collectorshiD of the port
at Wilmington, and Secretary Bush, who is
drawing down $75 a month, doesn't seem
to expect anything except that fat salary.
Bush got himself disliKed at the start be
cause he kicked in the traces against the
fusion proposition, but he's got onto his
job, as the saying is, and is sawing wood
now.
"We People's party men, who for
tbe most part are poor, must be a whole
lot of gudgeons, besides, to be paying
those salaries. The Republicans, who
could better afford to pay salaries, don't
do it. Major McLaugblin. ttfeir chairman,
works lite a ranch horse in harvest time
sixteen hours a day and does not receive,
directly or indirectly, a doliar for his serv
ices. Neither does Colonel Higgins, the
secretary, and both of them have done
and are doing a voluminous quantity of
work. They are donating their time and
labor out of pure patriotism for the party.
"Why don't Wardall and Bush do the
same? Ti;en they would be in a condition
in the year 1904 to ask the party for po
litical favors, for I guess it will be eight
years before the People's party will be
fully recovered from this dose of fusion.
i "I want you to understand th.at I'm no
Ificker, but Mr. Cator can't programme
ip* for Buckley or anybody else."
It is expected that Populistic discon
tent will have assumed a concerted ex
pression before another week shall have
rolled away. George W. Monteitb, Peo
ple's party nominee for Congress from
the First District, is being besieged with
letters urging him to hold a masa-meeting
in San Francisco and to show up Cator,
Wardall and the rest who havf made pos
sible this shameful fusion of political vir
tue and vice. Mr. Monteith is at present
considering the expediency of calling a
mass-meeting for tbe purpose of voicing
the sentiment of straight Populism. He
will start in on his campaign next week,
and will address his constituents in Red
Bluff next Tuesday and in Redding next
Wednesday.

THE SAILOR PUGILIST,
Tom Sharkey Lands in Town
Full of Fight and
Anxiety.
He Says Corbett Is a "Has Been, 1 '
Who Wou'd Rather Eat
Than Mill.
Tom Sharkey, the sailor pugilist, who
was alleged to be matched to figbt James
Jonah Corbett a twenty-round contest, ar
rived in this City last evening.
Sharkey looked hale and hearty, and
when informed of Corbett's uitimatam he
smiled and muttered something to him
self which did not reach the ears of those
who were attentive listeners.
"Well, Tom, I have a telegram from
Corbett," said Director-General Groom of
the National Club, "which states that a
letter is now speeding over the pJains that
will explain everything. I guess it will
reach me on Friday or Saturday."
SharKey was very outspoken in his
statements regarding Corbett's intentions.
He said that Corbett, in iiis opinion, does
not want to fight any person, and so far as
the letter was concerned he believed that
it contained some evasive excuse which,
in the estimation of the public, will stamp
the alleged champion just what he is at
present, viz.: "a pood has been."
"I predict," said Sharkey, "that Corbett
will say that owing to fcis engagement j
with Bob Fitzsimmons he must ignore
me; but that don't go. 1! Jim thinks he
can throw me overboard he is mistaken.
I will depart for the East just as soon as
I learn tnat Corbett has no further use for
me, and you can wager your clothes
against a wad of foe that I will make him
fight or chew hay.
"Why don't he come out like a man and
say that he is off the track and cannot do
any more fighting? Everybody knows
that he is a Has been, and the sooner he
will realize that the sporting fraternity is
on to his game the better it will be for the
sport. What does he want fooling with
Fitzsimmons? If they should ever meet
Long Bob wiu give him some of the same
medicine he administered to poor old Jack
iJempsey, but in larger and heavier quan
tities. Corbett owes me a fight, and i will
take it out of him the rim chance I set
and that ends ie"
The pools on the Tracey-Green fight
closed with Green a favorite at $10 to $9.
According to Billy Delaney, who is
I'racey's trainer, the Eastern man is cer
tain to come out ahead, but those in the
swim are placing their money on Green at
even money.
Populists and the New Charter.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, one of the Free
holders who framed the new charter, will
speak to-night at Academy of Sciences Hall,
819 Market street. Dr. Anderson was elected
to the charter convention by the Popniist
party of the City. He will especially explain
to-night the provisions in the charter relating
to municipal ownership, and all citizens are
cordially invited. â¢

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1896.
WEDDED WHERE
ALL WAS BRIGHT
Colonel Long and Miss
Amy Requa United at
St. Paul's.
The Interior Hidden With Ex
quisite Floral and Military
Decorations.
BREAKFAST IS A BIG BOWER
Handsome Army Officers Resplendent
in Full Uniforms Acted
as Ushers.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 7. J
One more wedding, and that one the
most imposing of all, was added to the
MARRIAGE AT THE REQUA RESIDENCE.
history of St. Paul's to-day, when Miss
Amy Requa was married to Colonel Oscar
Fitzalan Long, U. S. A. It was distinctly
a bright wedding â bright decorations,
bright National colors, brinht dresses and
| more beautiful than all the rich brightness
of the noonday autumn sun that sent its
rays through every pointed window in the
southern wall of the old church.
The interior of the building was cer
tainly more lovely and artistic than any of
the one thousand invited guests could
have anticipated, because the decorations
were original as to design and more pro
fuse than anything hitherto seen in Oak
land. The walls, pillars and windows
were not decorated, but rather complete
floral beds bad been transplanted from the
place of their growth to the interior of the
church. Smilax and ivy curled gracefully
around the upper windows and it might
i have grown where it rested it looked so
natural.
Over the altar rail was a large golden
eagle with outstretched wings and Jrcm it
J hung two handsome flags tbat fell in rich
folds to tbe fall, where they were eath
ered toward each side with dainty ropes
of smilax. The military effect of' the
decorations was obtained by the placing
of the National colors wherever its red,
white and blue folds harmonized with the
beds of flowers and greenery. The altar
was draped with rich white satin, heavily
embroidered with gold. Tall palms slool
like sentinels at the entrance to the chan
cel and over the spot where the bridal
couple stood hung a large bell of white
crysantbemums with an edge of pink
roses. The seven arches on each side of
the church were covered with foliage and
from the keystone of each was suspended
a pure white -bell.
The bridal party drove up at the church
door before the din on the noontime bells
had died away and while tbe well-known
but always inspiriting music filled the
church the bridal procession, three
abreast, marched down the center aisle.
Captain G. L. Edis, U. 8. A.; Lieutenant
Charles G. Lyrnan, U. 8. A.; Lieutenant
L. R. Bursess," U. 8. A. ; Lieutenant R. C.
Croxton, U. S. A.; Lieutenant Thomas W.
Winston, U. S. A., and Lieutenant S. A.
Cloman, U. S. A., in their capacity as
ushers, led the way, and surely no bridal
party could desire more imposing or hand
some heralds. Each usher was in full
dress uniform and their generous display
of gold braid, epaulettes and buttons
and gleaming swords reflected flickering
sunbeams from their path.
On approaching the altar the party was
met by Bishop Nichols and Rev. Robert
Ritchie and without any delay nverything
was in readiness for the ceremony.
The bride looked as composed as though
getting married Were an every-day occur
rence. She was simply but beautifully
gowned in heavy white satin, wilh high
corsage and long sleeves. A little rich '
lace at the throat and cuffs wa3 the only
relief. She wore no jewels. She was
escorted by her father, from whose hands
her future husband received her.
Miss Lucy King, the dainty little maid
of honor, is a cousin of the bride. She
wore a white mousseline de soie gown and
her head was uncovered with the excep
tion of a tulle veil fastened with a diamond
pin. The bridesmaids were dressed in
pink. Their hats were trimmed with
large ostrich feathers and carried roses,
all being of the same delicate tint. They
were Miss Ida Belle Palmer and Miss
Jessie Glascock, of Oakland; Miss Ella
Morgan and Miss Eleanor Wood, of San
Francisco; Miss Luita Booth of Piedmont,
and Miss Hamilton of Santa Monica.
The groom was in the uniform of a cap
tain of the United States army, his title
of colonel being derived from his National
Guard rank. He was attended by Captain
Marion P. Maus, U. S. A., also in full
uniform, as best man.
Mrs. Requa, the bride's mother, was ele
gantly gowned in heavy pompadour silk,
flowered in changeable purple and pale
yellow flowers. It was made with a vest
of soft yellow silk tulle, edged with glisten
ing passementerie. The elbow sleeves
were met by Jong wrinkled gloves, while
a small toque of yellow straw, trimmed
with ostrich tips, completed the costume.
Mrs. Mar& Requa, sister-in-law of the
bride, wore a handsome pink gown of
Dresden silk. The bodj.ee was made with
a soft chiffon front and wide revere, lined
with black satin. A small hat of pink and
black completed the costume. She was
accompanied by her husband.
Such was the bridal party that stood
before the officiating dignitaries and oc
cupied the front row of seats. Behind them
Bat the creme de la crerae of society.
The service did not occupy many
minutes, as thare was no music, and the
reading and responses were extremely
simple. When the benediction had been
pronounced, the maid of honor lifted the
bride's veil and the groom deliberately
embraced and kissed his wife. The bridal
procession then re-formed and were es
corted by the soldier ushers to their
carriages, and the social event of the year
was over.
This much was seen by the thousand,
but for the 350 who were invitea to the
wedding breakfast at Highlands other sur
prises were in store.
On the lawn in front of the beautiful
Reqna residence a large canvas tent formed
the foundation for a beautiful sylvan
bower, in which the wedding feast was
served. The interior was lined with flags
and flowers and ropes of ivy and smilax,
and in large boughs of trees up in the
roof canaries were hidden, and their
ceaseless song added greatly to the effect.
Like the decorations at the church it was
all the design of Mrs. Isaac Requa, who
caTied out the military idea to perfection.
In the tent were several round tables,
each one seating about a dozen persons.
At the table where sat Colonel and Mrs.
Long were Captain Maus, Mrs. Glascock,
Dr. Edie, Miss Morgan, Lieutenant Wins-
Ston, Miss Wood, Lieutenant Croxton,
Miss Booth, Lieutenant Burgess, Miss
Palmer, Lieutenant Cloman, Miss Hamil
ton, Lieutenat Lyruan, Miss King. The
Deux Temps Club, of which Mrs. Long
>vas a member, occupied the nearest two
tables. At the other tables were seated
over 300 distinguished guests.
In the mansion the many valuable pres
ents were displayed. They were as nu
merous as the friends of the colonel and
his bride.
Late this afternoon Colonel and Mrs.
Long departed, but kept their destination
secret. It is probable, that they may be
come permanent residents of Oakland on
their return.
YOUTHS' DIRECTORY.
High Tea Held at the Booth of "The
Pineg."
This is the closing week of the Fair
being held to aid the Youths' Directory,
and the crowds are increasing nightly.
Yesterday afternoon there was a special
feature in the form of a high tea given in
the artistically decorate.i booth, "The
Pines." There was a splendia attendance
to enjoy the musical programme and the
refreshments.
Mrs. Dr. Spitzy and Mrs. Wand sang;
charmingly tne duet from "La Giaconda."
Miss Yon Bredul, a pupil of the Berlin
Conservatory, favored the audience with
two numbers, but tbe gem of the after
noon was the solo by Mrs. Dr. Spitzy,
with violin obligato by Miss Knox. Mrs-
Payne sang three times, and, after a
gracefully done fan dance by the O'Shau
nessy children, the programme closed
with a song by Mr. O'Brien. The ladies
are particularly grateful to Professor
Crueils and Slgnor Ziliani, who accom
panied the soloists.
"Stanley's Official Bulletin."
D. 8. Stanley and Edward P. Fish, having

cisco and North Pacific Railway. Messrs.
Stanley and Fish contemplate many improve
ments in their publication, and will endeavor
to make it one of the handsomest of its kind
anywhere to be found. It is a most excellent
guidebook for that beautiful and picturesque
country between ban Francisco and UkiaJ*.
WOULD SHUT OUT
GOLD DEMOCRATS
Bryanites Want to Keep
Their Names Off the
Ticket.
Compelled to Own Up That
They Are Scared by the
Outlook.
LISTEN TO A TALE OF WOE.
They Allege That the National Demo
cratic Electors Will Take Away
Many Votes.
Will the Democratic or Populist parties
be entitled, under tbe plan of fusion which
they have adopted in this State, to place
their candidates' names on the ballot at
| the next general election? Garret Mc-
Enerney filed a petition in the Supreme
Court yesterday which indirectly raises
this interesting question.
The petition is that of William Craig,
Joe Hamilton, S. I. Allard, M. R. Merritt,
J. W. Martin, J. V. Webster, Daniel Mc-
Kay, C. W. Thresher and D. T. Fowler,
who are the Presidential electors on the
Democratic-Populist ticket under the
fusion plan. Thoy ask that a writ of man
date may be issued to compel L. H. Brown,
as Secretary of State of California, to cer
tify the nomination of the petitioners as
electors representing the Democratic party
and People's party conjointly in one group.
This means that after the name of each
nominee for the position of elector will be
placed the letters D. and P. As they will
get some votes from both parties, the re
sult will not show the proportion of votes
cast by either party should the writ be
granted. In the absence of such a show
ing by segregated party votes the Demo
cratic party may be compelled at the next
general election to get the names of its
candidates on the ticket by petition, and
the same may apply to the Populists.
The petitioners also attack tbe regularly
nominated candidates for Presidential
electors on the National Democratic ticket,
naming them and asking that, pending
the hearing of this application, the re
spondent may be directed to make no cer
tification of the nominations of Clay W.
Taylor, Thomas B. Bond, James K.
O'Brien, John Rosenfeld, Jeremiah Lynch,
Charles Anderson, John Roth, Robert T.
Hayne and L. B. Hakes as Presidential
electors by the National Democratic party.
The petition sets up that "neither said
electors nor tbe persons by whom they
were nominated, nor the organization
with which they affiliate, has any right,
license or authority whatever to appro
priate or take said name" (Democratic
party). Then the alarm of the Bryanites
is manifested in the following:
"To permit the use of the same (name)
will tend to confuse tbe voters of this
State and cause a great many votes to be
cast for said nine electors last named
which the Voters by whom they will be
cast intended and desired should be cast
for your petitioners, viz. : for the repre
sentatives of the regular Democratic
party.
"That by permitting said nine' electors
lastly above named to have printed, fol
lowing their names upon the official bal
lot, the designation 'National Demoaratic
Party,' it will result in depriving
your petitioners of a large number
of votes which they would other
wise receive and which they will
fail to receive, solely for the reason that
many of the electors will, in voting for
the nominees of said National Democratic
party, so self-styled, suppose and con
clude they are casting their votes for the
electors of the regular party organiza
tion."
Secretary of State Brown has requested
Attorney-General Fitzgerald to act for
him in the matter. No action was taken
by the court yesterday on the application.

as strong as they ought to be. The ': trouble is all from past

FOR VICF-PREBIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersflj
Election November 3, J896.
Work for Colonel Taylor and goort gov
ernment.
What objection have you to Republican
harmony?
Sewall is something of a rhetorician
himself of a poor kind.
Don't you know that opposition to Tay
lor is help to Buckley or Eaiuey?
It is a good thing for Bryan that he can
blow his own horn, for no one else will do
it for him.
Every effort to divide the Republican
party receives the undivided support of
the Democratic bosses.
Fusion iv California begins to look more
like Catorism than Bryanism and hasn't
been improved by the change.
"We want good times, plenty of work,
eood wages aud good money," says Mc-
Kinley, and so say we all of us.
Don't overlook the legislative ticket.
We must have a Republican Senator to
guard the industries of the State.
For very shame sake some Democratic
leaders are taking the stump, but they are
not crowing any louder than sick roosters.
The cause of protection is the cause of
every industry in the United States. Why
should not all industrious Americans vote
for it?
The election of Bryan would not be al
together a leap in the dark, for we have
tried Democracy and we Know what it
means.
In the coming prosperity of the San
Joequin, Stockton and Fresno will have a
lively rivalry to see which will lead the
procession.
It is announced that Cleveland will soon
return to Washington, but it is ngt an
nounced tbat anybody cares whether he
does or not.
Bryan's kick against the gold Demo
crats is subject to the serious drawback
tbat they kicked him first and are now
out of his reach.
Sewall's letter of acceptance settles the
question as to his staying on tbe ticket.
Tom Watson will have to continue his
ride on the brakebeam.
In this campaign the door of oppor
tunity swings open for labor, but the elec
tion of Bryan would shut it up as tightly
as did the election of Cleveland.
Under tbe Republican policies of sound
money and protection two-thirds of our
National debt was paid off. Why not re
turn to those policies and pay off tbe rest
of it?
The Bryanites and the National Demo
crats both declare Senator Hill has lost
an opportunity, but what troubles Hill is
that he is about to lose his beat in the
Senate.
In turning his attacks from the Repub
licans to the National Democrats Bryan
shows some discretion, for he can hope to
beat Palmer, but he has no chance at all
against McKinley.
Bewall's letter of acceptance ought to
mitigate the wrath of Tom Watson, for it
accuses capital of "avarice and unholy
greed" with as much fervor as Watson
himself could do It
Chairman Alford of the Democratic
State Committee may find some glory in
playing the role of the boy who stood on
the burning deck whence all but him had
fled, but all the same be is feeling very
lonely.
Republican stains in the town elections
in Connecticut have been even greater
than those of last year over the vote of
1894. It is becoming evident that instead
of a landslide we are going to have a con
tinental upheaval.
As a result nt the vigorous Republican
campaign in all the States that were con
sidered doubtful when the canvass began
there now remain none which are so con
sidered except some of those that were
counted sure for Bryan. Mr. Hanna's
management has ceased to be a jofce with
the Democrats.
An item is going the rounds of- the
Democratic and Populist press asserting
that "Leigh H. Irvine of the San Fran
cisco Call has been making a political
tour of California and writes that the
State will give Bryan 50,000 majority."
As a general rule it is not worth while to
kill a campaign lie, but we will Kill this
one ior luck. Mr. Irvine has never written
to anybody anywhere any such thing.
The item is absolutely without founda
tion or authority.
MR. SEWALL ACCEPTS.
Mr. Se wall's letter of acceptance is com
paratively short as such letters go, but it
is long enough to put an end to the hopes
of Tom Watson. Mr. Sewall accepts. He
will stick. â¢ He not only sticks, but he
stands with Mr. Bryan as an extreme ad
vocate of the worst features of the Chi
cago platform. Short as is bis letter of
acceptance it is long enough to show that
this millionaire ship-owner and banter is
not above playing the demagogue in order
to obtain votes. He says:
We are now told that the country has pros
pered under the present monetary standard;
that its wealth has enormously increased.
Granted. But in whose bands? In the hands
of the toilers, the farmers, tbe miners, the fab
ricators in the factories, the creators of the
National wealth in peace, its defenders in
war? Have they prosperity, which was theirs
so late as even two years ago? I deny it. I
deny it. None affirm It save those whose in
terests It is to do so, whose profits would di
minish as prosperity returns to those on whose
distress they thrive.
Against the statement that none affirm
that the people have prospered, we quote
the common experience of every producer
and industrious workingnian in the coun
try. We had prosperity until the election
of a Democratic President and a Demo
cratic Congress, pledged to free trade.
All are aware that hard times came upon
us only when Mr. Cleveland entered upon
his present term of office.
Against that statement of Mr. Sewall
we can set an extract from a speech de
livered by Major McKiniey on Tuesday,
arjd very fortunately published on the
same day as Mr. Sewall's letter of accept
ance. Mr. McKinley said:
We can hardly realize that from 1873 to
1893 we reduced the public debt from $2,333,
--331,308 to $570,000,000. We paid off during
those twenty years $1,623,581,671 of the pub
lic debt. And wÂ» were under a protective and
sound money system when we were making
large payments. Two-thirds of that great debt
disappeared, and while we were paying it off
we were building up in this country the most
splendid industrial enterprises, giving con
stant, steady employment to American labor.
The greater part of Mr. Sewall's letter
is made up of an appeal to what he fondly
believes are cia.-s prejudices. He would, if
he could, excite the passion of labor
against capital. In these portions of his
letter he has not been exceeded for ex
travagance of utterance by Tom Watson
himself. He speaks of "the avarice and
unholy greed of capital" : denounces what
he is pleased to call "tue monopoly of
geld," and shows himself in every sentence
not above appealing to the passions and
the ignorance of the most discontented
portion of the people.
The letter ought to satisfy Tom Watson
and induce him to get off the ticket. He
couid hardly hope to exceed Mr. Sewall
in his denunciations of property and law.
Sewall is proving himself a good running
mate for Bryan. They area well-matched
pair, tit representatives of a demoralized
Democracy.
ThÂ« ques.iou is what party policy will
best subserve the greatc*t good of the
greatest number, and what party prin
ciple â will most surely restore con
fidence, open aptbe channels of trade.
set in motion the wheels of industry,
and give employment to the idle hands.
It is not what is bÂ«Â«t for to-day, to
morrow or next year, but what iÂ» best
for the years that are lo come.â Mayor
I'ingree.
GOING TOO EAR.
xo pact of the Bryan campaign in the
Mississippi Valley has been more offensive
to American loyalty aud common decency
tht.n the attacks which have been made
upon Generals Sickles, Alger and Howard
by some of the radical supporters of the
fusion ticket. The canvass of taese vet
eran defenders of the Union seems to have
excited the worst passions of the Bryan
ites, and the brave old soldiers have been
maligned and insulted beyond the bounds
of toleration by good citiz ns>.
The Omaha World-Herald, of which
Bryan wast at one time the editor, is in
cluded by our Eastern exchanges among
the organs which have been most vin
dictive in their attacks, but as we have not
seen the language used by tt;at journal we
may let it pass. Another Bryanite organ,
however, the South Omaha Daily Suit, Is
quoted as having said:
A carload of old bummers, called "generals,"
are now touring the country on free passes
and their other expenses are being paid by
$ Hanna, telliag the people now to vote. They
were in Omaha la<t night. When the people
stop to consider why such skunks are so terri
bly interested it is enough to settle the matter
that it is not any love for the poor man or the
laborer that prompts these "ginerals" to thus
swing around the circle.
Such attacks upon men whom the coun
try honors have naturally aronsed the in
dignation of the people. It is not sur
prising, therefore, to learn that when
"Coin" Harvey ventured upon a similar
attack at Clinton, lowa, he was hissed and
hooted into silence by the audience which
had gathered to hear him. He is reported
to have referred to the generals as "old
wrecks of the Rebellion who have !osl
their honor and patriotism, and are tools
of political shysters." Further than that
it seems he was not permitted to go by
his audience, and some of the more in
dignant patriots present could hardly be
restrained from dragging him off the plat
form.
Tbe American people allow to news
papers and to stump orators a large
license of speech, but there is a limit to
that as to all things. General Sickles,
General Alger and General Howard have
attested their devotion to the Union, their
loyalty and their patriotic love of the Re
public by services too arduous, too honor
able and too distinguished for any good
citizen to sit in silence and hear them
maligned. It is about time that the
agitators and demagogues who have
sprung up among us were made to under
stand that the American people have a
feeling of profound reference for the
veterans of the war for the Union, and
regard any defamation of them as an in
sult to themselves.
My greatest concern, my chief object
in this, as in every campaign, Is to drive
from oar shores distress and wait and
misery, and lift up those who are bowed
down, and bring to those who are
in want work and prosperity. And I
will never view with tolerance anyÂ«yÂ«
tem which has a different object toward
Â»ny American citizen anywhere within
the limits of our great Kepubllcâ Mo-
Kinley.
LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS.
It was a happy thought of the people of
Galesburg, 111., to dedicate the soldiers'
monument in the cemetery of that city on
the anniversary of the debate there between
Lincoln and Douglas. The event in this
way became a double commemoration. It
not only recalled the heroic deeds of those
who died that the Union might live, but
revived memories of the great debate
which, with the exception of that between
Webster and Hayne, is the most illus
trious in our annal3.
Very properly the principal speaker at
the dedication ceremonies was the emi
nent son of the chief of the two great
disputants of thirty-eight years ago.
Robert T. Lincoln does not owe to the
memory of hit father all the honor in
THE SAKT FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1896.
which he is held by the American people.
He has rendered many services to the
Union and has proved over and over
again that his sympathies and sentiments
are in thorough accord with a genuine
Americanism. Standing beside the monu
ment which marks the graves of the Na
tion's dead he did not forget tbat when
the war broke out the debate between
Lincoln and Douglas ended and that tbe
creat Democrat was as loyal as the greater
Republicau to the preservation of the
Union.
Very naturally Mr. Lincoln drew from
the memories of the Civil War the lesson
which is applicable to the present time.
After pointing out that when the war be
gan men of all parties united for the de
fense of the Nation, and proved that the
patriotism ol the people was superior to
its partisan spirit, he said:
In the mind of a lover of his country there
is no difference between an attack upon Its
territory and an attack upon its honor. When
either is lost all is lo9t that gives the pride of
citizenship of a great country. In the de
fense of one as iv tho defense of the other
there must be a sacrifice of all private inter
ests, a sinking of all mere party feeling. Each
citizen must listen not to sophistries addressed
to his suspected selfishness, but to the voice of
his own conscience. Thi.i was what was done
by the patriots in every National crisis. Their
union was then invincible and their union
will always be invincible.
It is one of the best assurances of the
stability of our form of government that
party spirit does not materially affect the
underlying patriotism of the people. We
see to-day in the action of conservative
Democrats, lea by Palmer and Buckner,
an illustration of that spirit which sets
the welfare of the country above party
success, and in the general gratification
which this affords the whole country will
share with the people of Galesburg the
honor in which they recall the memories
of Lincoln and of Douglas.
The mint Â» will not furnish the farmer
with more consumers. He has the most
profitable market for what he produces
at home and not abroad, lie is met In
the markets of the world by the prod
ucts of other lands beyond the Â«ea. The
only market he can rely upon everyday
of the year is the American market,
and what he wants to know is how to
make that market the best. He cannot
do it by closing the mills. He cannot
do it by putting out the fires of our fur
nace*. He cannot do it in taking busi
ness away from the great railroad lines
of the country.â McKinley.
BRYAN ON DEMOCRACY.
Mr. Bryan has shown that discretion
which is the better part of valor by turn
ing his attacks from McKinley and the Re
publican party to General Palmer and the
National Democracy. Against Major Mc-
Kinley he could do nothiug; but he has a
reasonable expectation of beating General
Palmer.
While this is discretion, when contrasted
with courage, it can hardly be called good
politics. If Mr. Bryan and the managers
of his campaign were at all wise, they
would ignore the division In the Demo
cratic party, and endeavor by every means
in their power to hold all Democratic votes
for the Populist fusion. Bryan and his
managers, however, have completely lost
their heads. They are going through the
campaign railing against everybody, and
reviling even those who mi^ht, with wiser
tactics, have been persuaded to remain
neutral, if not to give at least partial sup
port to the fusion ticket.
In his address at Indianapolis Mr.
Bryan said of the National Democracy:
"If it was big enough to justify the name
it would be a stupendous fraud, but it is
too small to be called stupendous. I will
call it a transparent fraud. It was the
first political convention ever hold in this
country where the members of the com
mittee nominated a ticket they did not ex
pect to vote ior, and the first case where
men received a nomination and do not
want to be voted for."
If Mr. Bryan is correct in saying that
the Indianapolis ticket does not expect to
be voied for be ought to have been wise
enough to make a bio for the votes of
those men who might otherwise have
voted lor Palmer and Buckner. Instead
of doing so he chose to denounce them
and mock at them in a way that can have
no other effect than that of alienating
them from himself. Many a gold-standard
Democrat might have voted for Mr.
Bryan as the champion of free trade if
Mr. Bryan had the courage to main
tain and assert a consistent course on that
question, but by ignoring the tariff issue
and pushing to the front only ttie Popu
list features of his platform he has de
prived himself of any right to expect the
support of the conservative, sound-money,
free-trade Democrats.
It is not to be wondered that the abler
leaders of the Democratic party have re
fused to take the stump in defense of such
a programme as the boy orator has put
forth. His tactics compel division in the
Democratic ranks, and no D-mocrat who
looks to the future and has am- hope of
being accepted as a Democratic leader
after the collapse of this futile campaign
can come forward as the champion of
Bryanism. All leaders of National repute
are wise enough to remain silent and wait
until the confusion is over. They see that
nothing is to be gained by helping Bryan,
and they are determined not to lose them
selves with him in tuis futile effort at
fusion with Populism.

NOTINCONSISTENT
Judge E. V. Spencer Tells
Why He Supports Wil
liam McKinley.
Judge E. V. Spencer, the well-known
jurist of Lassen County sends the follow
ing open letter to the Sacramento Bee:
Svsanvule, Lassen County, Cal., J
October 2, 1896. J
To the Sacramento Evening Beeâ My Diar
Bke: In your prfper of September 10, 1896,
you have seen fit to republinh a letter written
to you Dy me on March 18, 1896, In which let
ter I Indorsed the declarations of the Bee
favorable to the coinage of silver; then you
published an interview with a Call reporter
in which I declared myself strongly In favor
of McKinley; then you were pleased to say
that I shoula remember that Bryan's state
ments are to the same tune I sang in March of
this year:
In connection with these statements you
have tried to hold me before the public as an
example of political inconsistency.
Under strong headlines you have placed me
as "Spsncer agaiust Spencer." My attention
having been but recently called to this publi
cation I embrace the first opportunity to call
your attention to the error into which you
have fallen in your attempt to make me ap
pear to be inconsistent with myself.
Firstâ My letter of March 18 does not Bay one
word about McKinley or protection.
Secondâ ln my interview with The Call I
did not say anything about silver except to
say that "Mr. Bryau proclaims himself the
iriend of the laborer, and all in the same
breath he declares himself in favor of glviug
the work to the foreigner and of opening our
mints to foreign silver."
Now, my dear Bee, I call your attention to
the fact that your alleged inconsistency is not
apparent Jrum any language used by me in
the matter published by you.
If there is any inconsistency, it must be
found in your apparent supposition that I am
now opposed to the coinage of silver and that
I am supporting Mr. McKinley because of his
opposition thereto.
But 1 beg to assure you that the apparent In
ferences which you seem to draw from my
statements are grobsly incorrect. I am not
supporting Mr. McKinley for either of the rea
sons suggested, but I am supporting him for
reasons greater and more important than
either. Aid, ns you have sought to piace me
iv an uncomfortable position before tlie pub
lic, I trust you will do me the justice to give
the same publicity to my statement of the sub
jects referred to in your publication.
And allow me to assure you that if there is
any apparent inconsistency in the position oc
cupied by me in March last and in mv position
now, I ara more deeply interested in knowing
that I am rigut now than I am in an attempt
to explain away such inconsistency.
It matters but litt;e what notions you or I
may hnve entertained last March, but it Is im
portant that we should be prepared to vote
rijiht when the time comes.
And first let me say that I have never been
In favor of the unlimited coinage of silver, for
I have never been able to understand how it
would benefit the American people to have
the forplgner*s silver coined in our mints. But
1 have bt.-en in favor 'oi coining all the silver
produced from the mines located within the
borders of the United States.
But, my dear Bee, it does not matter just
now what I would have or what you would
have if we could, or what either of us said or
ttiuught before the conventions, we are cow
compelled to choose in this contest between
two candidates, two platforms, two conditions,
aad in common with the multitude we must
go to the polls not to have what we would, but
to choose which of these two we will vote for.
I cannot get all of that which would please me
best from either party. But when the great
multitude of the wise men from the East met
in the convention, of my party and yours, and
after a careful deliberation determined that
the little imiidf ill of delegates from the shores
of tbe Pacific were mistaken in their thought
as to what was best for the whole people of
this great Nation. And afier that ma
jority had decided that it was not wise
and that it would i.ot be for the best
interests ol the majority of our people to
embiirk in the free and unlimited coinage of
the silver of the world, and wnen that ma
jority dec'ared that in their best judgment it
would result in driving the gold out of the
country and in leaving us with silver alone,
that it would produce panic and distress and
demoralization In business everywhere in our
land, I am free to confess that the Judgment
of the multitude causes me to hesitate and to
begin to think seriously whether they might
not be right and I wrong, even in my desire
for the coinage of our own product of silver.
My modesty and a full realization of the
fact that it is not given to any oue to know it
all led me to take off my Dai mid bow a re
spectful regard for the aggregate wisdom of
that Republican statesmanship which has led
this Nation through its darkest days and
bardes; struggle to a condition of solidity,
strength, wealth and prosperity, which have
made it the marvel of the nations of the earth.
And lam not one of those who believe in the
universal rottenness of mankind, so tiiat when
I have heard men and newspapers cry out
out agaiust the St. Louis convention and de
clare that it was controlled by tbe money of
Wall street, I have tr.ought it possible "that
such declarations mieht arise from the fact
that the parties making them would not dare
to truit themselves within the reach of temp
tation.
Giving full faith and credit to the honesty
and sincerity of all the conventions, we find
ourselves compelled to choose between Demo
cratic free trade and what is ca'led free siWer
ou the one hand and Republican protection
and sound money on the other, so I am
ready to declare tbat I will not swallow Bry
anisticand Democratic free trade, even though
covered ever so ingenuously under a coating
of silver.
But I most unhesitatingly declare myself in
favor of trotection as the source from which
tbe American people, aud particularly the
laboring masses, can receive greater benefit,
more la&tiug success and 'prosperity than from
any other source of relief within our reach. '
And no matter how much I might believe in
the wisdom of coining silver, wnen that con
sideration is put in the balance as against
protection to our Industries, it sicks into in
significance.
Protection will afford sure relief and sure
employment to the American laborer of every
kind.
It will make manufacturing profitable and
will thus reopen our workshops which have
been closed by that Democratic fraud, "a
tariff for revenue only," and will thus furnish
labor for millions of our now unemployed. It
whl make the production of sugar profitable,
so that we shall be able to produce what we
consume at home, and in this item alone will
save a hundred millions a year of our money
to be distributed among our own people in
stead of being sent out of the country as now
to i>ay cheap labor in other lands for what we
consume. This sugar item alone will furnish
more labor ior the unemployed aud will bring'
more prosperity to our country and keep more
mouey in the country aud in circulation than
it is posslbe for the coinage of silver to do un
der the most favorable conditions which any
reasonable man can anticipate.
With our mills and manufactories producing
the commodities we use, and the produce of
the orchard, vineyard and farm protected
from foreign competition, the farm will pay,
mid with our wool, i umber and other products
properly protected and our money kept at
home labor will be plenty and the laborer well
paia, aud the sunlight of prosperity and hap
piness will shine in at the poor man's w.ndow
and ail will be well as it has been in the past,
when you and I, my dear Bee, were hurrahing
for the grand results of Republican protection
and were warning the people to bÂ»vvare of the
dangers ol Democratic free trade, aud were
pointing out the ruin it had wrought In the
years gone by.
My dear Bee, in your support of Bryan you
seem to >>aye forgotten that Mr. Bryan is and
ever nai been the rankest and most unreason
able free trader in the United States. That he
has always been the sworn enemy of that pro
tection which you and I have always believed
in and have so earnestly advocated.
You seem to have forgotten that it was
Bryan who talked longest and loudest in Con
gress against the sugar bounty and who did
most to cause its repeal and thus cut down a
growing industry which very soon would nave
furnished labor to many thousands of those
laborers whom he now pretends to love so
much. ,
You seem to have lost sight of these facts:
That it was Bryan who moststrongly urged up
on Congress the putting of wool and very many ,
other commodities of our produce upon the
free list and thus brought poverty, hard times
and diuress to those having all their wealth
invested in those enterprises and thus turned
another multitude of hit dearly beloved
laborers out of a job.
That this man Bryan, with all his power ,
advocated that reduction of our tariff on for
eign products which has turned a million and j
a half more of his dear friends, the laborers in
our manufactories, out in the cold without a
job, and has left them to save themselves from
hunger by eating up the money they had .
stored up In the savings banks during the
years of that Republicau protection and pros- â 
perityof which you and I have boasted so
much.
That Bryan, with all the force of his nature, |
Delieves that instead of protecting American â¢
labor, we should give the job to the foreigner
who can live cheaper and work cheaper than
the American laborer can do.
That Bryan, so far as it was possible for him
to be, is responsible for the fact that to-day
millions of foreign laborers are basking in the I
sunshine of proÂ»perity by doing our work, 1
while an equal number of those American (
laborers, whom he wants to vote for him, are
suffering from want, poverty and Idleness.
And that Bryan believes in continuing this '
condition of things. I
Thai he believes In, and if be Is given the 1 I
power, he will continue to grlva the job to the
loreigner and to impoverish this country by
sending its money across the ocean to pay the
laborer in foreign lands.
But these are not all. Mr. Bryttn proposes to
further help the foreigner by coining his sil
ver free of charge and at the expense of the
United States and at the risk ot any ruin and
disaster it may bring to our people.
And it is this last Â«ct of kindness to tbe for
eigner which seems to please you, my old .Re
publican friend, the most.
You say I "should call to mind that the only
free trade which Bryan has advocated during
the present campaign is the free and unlimited
coinage of silver." Yes, I have watched the
evideucesof the shrewd politician displayed
by Mr. Bryan in that he seems to have forgot
ten his own history and to have either for
gotten all the sound protection teachings of
that immortal founder of Democracy, Thomas
Jefferson, or he is trying to kick up so much
dust by his loud cry for silver as to hide his
own history and his real principles from pub
lic observation.
But while I am carefully watching all Mr.
Bryan says in this campaign I liave not for
gotten that when in Congress in a debate with
Congressman McKenna of California he de
clared that the policy of protection to Ameri
can industries, wnlch you and I have always
believed in and have always advocated, was
like the policy of the pickpocket and robber.
I have not forgotten that on the 20th of
March, 1892, when our Senator Perkins was
defending the sugar bounty in the interests of
tbe production of our own sugar, Mr. Bryan
declared tnat he was opposed to the sugar
bounty and also to all kinds of protection and
weut on to say: "The differeuce between a
protective tariff and a bounty, is simply a dlf^
ference in form. It Is tbe difference between
the man who meets you on the highway,
knock., you down and tnkes what you have,
and the man who steal* into your house in the
night while you are asleep and robs you of
your treasure. And if I had to make a choice
of the two, I should consider the highway rob
ber the more honorable." And wi.ile I remem
ber all this and very much more like it, I am
not aware that the man who in Congress placed
you and I on the level with the pickpockets
and highway robbers, has met with any change
of heart in his estimate of us.
The only change I have been able to observe
is in your strange a-.ti unaccountable love for
the man who has publicly declared that you
hava been a pickpocket and a robber all your
life.
It is not alone the fact that thi* political
demagogue has Insulted you and myself and
that he tramples ou the wisdom of Jefferson,
Washington and the long line of protectionists
who have made tbe pages of our National his
tory bright and glorious by their words of
wisdom aud patriotism, but the fact that this
poiitical curiosity still entertains the same
idea* and adheres to the same principles so
oiten announced by him that makes me un
willing by my vote to aid him in his ambition
to ride roughshod over the wisdom of the ages
and me best interests of the people.
While you are talking about my inconsis
tency, how Is it with tbe Bee? If you desire
any further reasons why I am against Bryan
and in favor of McKinley, I might say that
while McKiniey represents the embodiment of
all the great political principles which you
and I have advocated all our lives, Bryan not
only represents tbe reverse, but he is the rep-,
resentative of a political conglomeration
which i 3 only a huge bubble which arose from
the froth of a wild political speecn made by
himself in Chicago, and which, although,
gilded by a silver coating, just as soon as it
rises high enough so tnat the light of American
intelligence strikes It; will dry up and explode
Jlke any other bubble.
He represents that Demo-Populistic de-'
formity which was born when he was nomi
nated in July last, and which will die when
he is defeated at the ballot-box in November
next. It had no ancestry aud it will have no
posterity.
With this brief statement of some of the
reasons why I am for McKinley and agaiust
Bryan, I am, very respectfully,
E. V. Epexcer.
THE TWO- TAILED CAT.
A cat with two tails on the top of the fence
Was sitting one day, full of pride and pretense,
When a rooster flew up and attempted to crow.
"Hello!" cried the cat, "now that's cheeky, you
know.
For a seedy old chicken you moke rather free;
And only one tail ! Well, I never!" said he.
And, arching his spine to position convex.
He turned toward the rooster his double annex.
The rooster next day met that very same cat,
His head ha ging down and bis vertebra flat.
He turned not again In his insolent pride;
There seemea to be something he wanted to hide.
But. the cause of his sorrow was plain to bÂ° seen â
One tall and a slump where the other bad been.
â¢â¢Heiio!" snid tbe bird, -'you are surely in pain."
"Alas!" said the cat, "those rude people in Maine!
Wv dual appendage no longer prevails:
They've trampled off one of my beautiful tails."

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
There is some amusing reading in an inter
view with Ugo Gorlitz just published in the
Strand Musical Magazine. Gorjitz will be re
membered as Paderewski's secretary and gen
eral factotum, who, after being pampered and
caressed all along tne route, took upon him
self toward the end of the tour to say for pub
lication some of the most slighting things
about Americans and American institutions
that were ever uttered. This little great man,
who shines with a reflected glory, seems to
have reached a pinnacle of deluded self-esteem
which is grotesque. In reply to the question
of the Strand reporter whether he had met
with any disagreeable Incidents in America
Paderewski's business man remarked that the
only thing that jarred on his nerves occurred
at Dcs Moines, where unfortunately he and his
star arrived on election day. At the hotel the
sensidve Goriitz and Paderewski were "con
stantly annoyed by the intrusion of politicians
who kept on mistaking our room for that of
the Governor of the State. To crown every-
Paderewski's Factotum, "Who Was
Annoyed by an lowa Band*
j thing half an hour before the recital a street
I band commenced playing outside." This street
band seems to have been the only trial to his
fortitude which the pampered Gorlitz was
called upon to sustain during his American
tours with the Polish pianist. The enthusi
astic demonstrations of admiration of which
"we" were the object do not seem to have
jarred upon his sensibilities, possibly because
of the four and five dollar prices to which he
naively alludes thus: "Our car was sur
rounded by people who immediately Mr. Pad
erewski appeared cried out, 'Yes, yes; it's
he!' and in about an hour every seat was sold
at four and five dollar prices." The quotation
"It's he" is the one drop of balm which Gor
litz pours on the sensibilities of the Polish
pianist's American friends. It was kind of
him to spare us, for he might have represented
the admiring throng as crying; regardless of
grammar, 'It's him."
An interesting recital was given not long
ago in Paris at the theatrical and musical ex
position in the Palace of Industry. It was the
rirst exhibition of a new system of piano
pedals i&vented by a man named Cateura of
Barcelona in Spain. There were six pedals to
the pianoforte, including the forte, celeste and
tonal pedals, the uses of which are already
well known. The three new pedals included
in the system are called the pedale soudine,
which vfas found by the critics to weaken and
suppress the sound in a very curious fashion
aud to give it a fluidity, which made it almost
disappear; the pedale claire, which, on the con
trary, gave great intensity and distinctness to
the notes, and, lastly, the pedale harmonique,
which mads the harmonies struck on the key
board stand out in an entirely new fashion for
the piano. These six pedals are placed in the
following order: For the right foot, the pedale
Claire, the pedale forte and the pedale sourdine;
lor the left foot, the pedale celeste, pedale tiar-
I monique, pedale tona'.e (for retention). It is
j said that the mechanism Is not difficult to
' master. The recital which introduced tbe new
I and revised piano to Paris was given by Emilio
i Sabater, a young Spanish pianist.
A showy, attractive march composed by E.
E. Schmitz, musical director of the Columbia
Theater, has just been published. The new
work Is called "The Great Unknown." In
these days of Sousa and his admirers it Is hard
for an American march composer to break
away from the traditions of "The Washington
| Post March" and its numerous imitations. Mr.
Schmitz, however, has had the courage to strike
out for himself and "The Great Unknown" has
plenty of "go," though it is not of the Sousa
school. It is written in six-eight time, a
| rather uncommon time-signature In popular
marches, but this does not prevent it from
having a good, swinging rhythm. While the
modulations are simple the changes of key
which occur in "Tne Great Unknown" add
considerably to its color and variety. The
march will be almost certain to achieve popu
larity. It is easy to play and may saiely be rec
ommended as an excellent study in phrasing
to those pianoforte students who affect the
popular style of composition.
The Paris Opera Comlque has reopened for
the winter season with a most successful re
prise of Gluck's "Orpheus." On the first night
the public noticed that the staircases leading
to the auditorium were new, and now a rather
startling story connected with them has leaked
out. It seems that last May \he staircases
were declared unsafe by experts, and the
people connected with the theater were ex
pecting them "to fall from day to day. All
through June the manager lived in hourly
terror of a catastrophe, but nothing seems to
have been done till the theater was closed for
the summer vacation. The Opera Comique is
an opera-house subsidized by the Government,
and one would imagine that an unsafe stair
case would not be permitted to linger there a
day. Nevertheless the Paris papers gravely
describe thexondktion of affairs now that the
dauger has passed, and they add that the hew
staircases are warranted to last till the new
home of the opera comique is completed.
George H. Clutson has been uttering a very
true wail of an accompanist He says: "He

of finding little or no difficulty in transposing

Poetry and music have been called into

It is comical to see how the critics of the
New York dailies have wilted before Oscar
H-jmmerstein's new opera "Santa Maria."
These gentlemen nre in the habit of jumping
on a piece with both feet when it does not
please them, and it can scarcely be credited
that the doggerel of Hammerstein's libretto or
the music of his score have tickled their ears
or their imaginations. The fact is that Ham
merstein Is nut a common composer, who earns
His daily bread and beer by writing operas.
He is a Dig magnate in the theatrical world,
with a ble theater of his own; so, In spite of
the fact that his music is crude ana rudimen
tary, dull and stupid, the critics, with one or
two exceptions, have slapped him on the buck,
and said, "Bravo, Oscar! Versatile oldboyl
Do it again" and the long suffering public
is afraid that he will.
Kafaele Vitali, a singer well known in hii
day, who has just died in Italy, had a curious
experience during the course of his career.
Vitali was a tenor, as well known for his good
singing as for his remarkable qualities as an
actor. In operas such as Rossini's "Othello"
and Donizetti's "Lucia" he never failed to
bring down the house by his pathos. One
evening at Rome, while he was singing in
"Louisa Miller," he was suddenly struck with
a lowering ot the voice, which made it im
possible for him to finish his role. In one
moment he had been changed from a tenor
into a barytone, and for the. rest of his career
he sang in this latter capacity. He retired
from the stage some years ago, and devoted
the rest of his life to teaching.
A new musical sensation Is agitating the
Italian musical journals. It was started by
the Punsolo Parlamentare of Naples, which,
received from its Milan correspondent the fol
lowing dispatch: A very reliable informant,
who is in a position to know, assures me that,
whatever people may say, Verdi will write no
more for the theater, but he is putting the fin
ishing touches to a grand oratorio, something
in the style of Mendelssohn's "Elijah." Ora
torio Is not a popular form of musical diver
sion in Italy, but Verdi has proved himself
capable of writing sacred music, and it Is very
possible that the grand old man may have the
promised surprise of an oratorio in store.
The comic opera epidemic has spread from
London to New York ii the productions which

comic opera really seem to be variety shows

the musical director of Count Esterhazy's pri
vate theater at Totis, in Hungary. It will be

and Drop Anchor.
SHE HAD NOTABLES ABOARD.
More Disgruntled Miners Arrive From
Alaska on the Schooner Emma

The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Belgic arrived from Hongkong
via Yokohama yesterday. The cabin
passengers were Prince Michel Hilkoff
and son, Lieutenant Gregoire Tschertkoff ,
Mrs. R. Marshall Allen, Vassely Blocka
koff, Miss M. F. Wheeler, Dr. W. R.
Scrog^s and Mrs. Scroggs. Prince Hil
koff is Imperial Minister of Ways of Com
munication in Hussia, and is on his way
to New York and the East on a pleasure
trip.
When the Belgic pot in she came to an
anchor off Meiggs wharf, while Dr. Blue
the United States quarantine officer and
Dr. Chalmers the State quarantine officer
went over the vessel. There were eitjht
Japanese and 137 Chinese in the steerage.
The latter were put aboard the United
States quarantine boat and taken to Angel
Island, where they will be examined.
When all tnis preliminary work had been
gone through it was too late on the tide
to dock the vessel, so she steamed up into
Mission Bay and a?ain came to an anchor.
In the meantime. Prince Hilkoff and his
party was landed, in tlie quarantine boat
Governor Perkins aud at once went to the
Palace Hotel.
The captain of the Belgic found no diffi
culty in making port in the fog, and came
to an anchor close to the revenue cutters
Perry and Rush. During the day it was
almost impossible to see across the Golden
Gate, but, nevertheless, fourteen st- amers
and several sailing vessels found their
way in. Among them was the steam
schooner Farallon, that left Eureka two
hours after the Monadnock. The latter
is probibiy outside in the fog and will
come in wi en it lifts. The sealing
schooner Rattler was passed twelve miles
off the Heads in a calm, but she got in
during the night.
Tbe British ship Kelat also got in. She
went from Muritias to Victoria, B. C. in
ballast, but was outside of Cape Flattery
for over a week before a tug picked her
up. During that time she twice narrowly
escaped going ashore in calms, and on ar
riving at her destination Captain Kursen
was informed that he had to come to San
Francisco to load. As sdon as her ballast
is out the vessel will be filled with wheat
for Europe.
Another vessel that got in was the Rus
sian steamer Kotik. She brought in the
most valuable fur cargo that ever came
into port. Amonethe shipload of skins
were 14,418 seal, 134 sea otter, 1300 blue
fox, 1276 bear, 4014 sabjf, 3137 red fox,
4641 fawn. 383 martin, 200 ermine, 419 land
otter, beside thousands of white fox and
deer and four silver fox skins. The cap
tain of the Kotik reports that in Oonamak
Pass he sighted a steam schooner which
he took to be the Jennie bound to San
Francisco.
The one-time sealing schooner Emma
and Louisa, witti thirty miners from
Alaska, also reached port. The men tell
the same story as that related by the men
who came back on the Prosper. They
clubbed together when the gold fever was
at its height and purchased the schooner
from Ross <fe Hewlett. James J. Wake
iieid was the leader of the venture, tuit it
turned out to be a dismal failure. Colors
of gold could be seen everywhere, but no
where could it be found in paving quan
tites. Sick and disheartened the miners
packed up their belongings and returned
to San Francisco. The Prosper and Emma
and Louisa are now for sale.
People on the water front are asking
what has become of the Lena L. The
captain of the Prosper reports tuat she
left Alaska before his vessel last Aueust
for San Francisco, and she has not been
heard of since. The schoouer was formerly
a tug, but was almost consumed in a fire.
Her owners took the machinery out and
built another vessel. The remains of the
burnt tUÂ£ were sold to Captain E. Wey
man, who rebuilt her and made the re
mains into a good-looking schooner. Wey
man was formerly owner of the halibut
schooner Ellwood, that was lost in Alas
kan waters, and he took the Lena L north
on a fishing and trading cruise. Hi
friends think that he has stopped on his
way down and will get in all right.
Among the Mariposa's cargo will be
twenty tons of leather for Sydney and
thirty cases oi Jager beer for New Zealand.
This is one of the first shipments of the
latter commodity that has ever gone from
a San Francisco brewery.
The steam schooner Tillamook is having
her boilers replaced and the Greenwood
her engines overhauled. Both vessels will
be ready for service again in a few days.
Captain Shaw of the Red Stack Com
pany's tug Redmond did a clever piece of
work yesterday. He was docking the Ger
man bark Bertha, and in order to leach
her berth had to puss between two British
ships. The way was narrow and a strong
floou tide was running. Captain Shaw
took the Bertha in at full speed and made
as clever a landing as has been seen on
the water front in many a day.
The wife and family of Phil Riley. who
was killed by William Britten in a North

subscription to aid the widow is now being
taken up on the water front.
The Spreckels tug Rescue went up to

The Pacific Mail Company's China will

Green-Tracy Contest Was

TRACY'S BROKEN LEG A HOAX
Admirers of Fistic Science Predict
in To-Night's Bout a Sight
Worth Seeing.
"Young" Mitchell was about as angry
aud excited a member of the pugilistic
brotherhood as could be found in seven
States last night. It was all owing to a re
port being circulated round town in re
gard to the contest between Green and
Tracy, which will take place to-night at
Woodward's pavilion,
"Somebody; I don't know who," ex
claimed the irate manager of the New Oc
cidental Club," has been spreading the
story all over town that Green and Tracy
will not fight till to-morrow night. Worse
than that, late this evening many of my
friends and acquaintances have come to
me and asked how in the world Tracy had
managed to break his leg."
"Why, I was perfectly astounded. No
news was sent to me about Tracy breaking
his leg. At once I telegraphed to Oakland
to find out if it were true. Word came
back immediately from Billy Deianey that
there was not a word oi truth in it. He
said Tracy was never in better condition in
his life.
"I want to # Â«tate positively right here
that Tracv and Green are going to meet
each other at Woodward's Pavilion to
night, and mat for a fieuter who has just
broken his leg Tracy will get around as
fast a.s anybody could wish for."
Ail lovers of sparring are expecting a
treat in this matcn, and there is not much
likelihood of anybody being disappointed.
It is without doubt as good a match so far
as equality of the men is concerned as has
been made in this City for years.
Both men will enter the ring in physi
cal condition as perfect as that of a Ro
man gladiator. Green is intensely ea^er
to best his opponent, as it will render his
name famous in the sporting kingdom to
conquer tbe hero of as many well-earned
battles as is Tommy Tracy. On the other
hand Tommy, though reputed to be rather
a philanthropic youth, is slightly averse
to letting Green gain renown at his ex
pense. ______________

H. J. GALLAGHER ILL.
Shocked by the Collapse of the Fifth-
Street Building.
H. J. Gallagher of the undertaking firm
or McAvoy & Gallagher on Fifth street is
confined at his home at 123 Castro street
with a severe illness. His sickness is of
such a nature that Dr. Buckley, his
physician, forbids any one to call upon
the sufferer. The complaint at first was
gastritis. Mr. Gallagher was recovering
from this when he received a shock to his
nervous system from which he has not re
covered and which turned into nervous
prostration.
On the afternoon that the four-story
building on Fifth street and Mint avenue
collapsed he was walking to his place of
business, and was so preoccupied that he
did not observe the ruins, but walked into
his private office. As he entered the
door he stumbled over the body of a dead
woman, one of the victims of the disaster,
and the shock to him was very severe.
Since then his condition has been a mat
ter of serious concern to his family and
friends. It has been necessary to keep a
close watch over the sufferer, whose mind
turns to gloomy subjects. Mr. Gallagher
is at last showing signs of recovering.
JAPAN ON THE SEAS,
Lines to England, Australia and
India Have Commenced
Running.
Captain Seabury of the China Tells of
Twelve New Steamships Bought
in London.
"Japan is evidently aspiring to be known
among the nations of the sea," commented
Captain Beabury of the Pacific Mail
steamer China yesterday. The captain is
just back from the Orient, where the ambi
tious maritime ventures of the Mikado's
subjects are exciting much interest.
'There seems to be no lack of money
behind the scheme," continued Captain
Seabury. "Though I have nothing definite
in the way of figures I am assured by per
sons in a position to speak authorita
tively that tbe various Japanese lines are
subsidized to such an extent that all their
running expenses are covered. During
my brief stay in Oriental waters steamers
of the Nippon Kaisha Company sailed for
Europe, for Australia and lor Bombay.
"In addition to the vessels already used,
twelve more have been secured in Lon
don, to be used, I believe, on the line be
tween Japan and England. The length
of these vessels, if placed in line one after
the other would just reach a mile, thus
giving each steamer an average length of
440 feet. â¢
"Regarding the lines to India and Aus
tralia I have little information. The ves
sels which left for these localities during
my stay were the first on each Jine. It is
ra\her early to predict either success or
failure for the venture.
"While the various lines are in receipt
of the subsidy of course they will get along
swimmingly, but how long the subsidy
will last no one seems to know. Whether
the lines will be able to pay their own ex
penses soon, or at all, remains to be seen.
"At tbe same time the Japs seem bent
on making a fight for the honor of being
known as a great maritime power. If
persistency alone will carry the day, they
certainly stand a fair chance of succeed
ing, in a measure at least. In the mean
while the new enterprise is calling forth
much comment in commercial and mari
time circles, and its outcome is awaited
with no small interest.

Associated Improve
ment Clubs.

Now.
FIRST AMENDMENT OPPOSED.
John Boland Objects to an Alleged
Expression Concerning the Board
of Health.
The meeting of the San Francisco Asso
ciation of Improvement Clubs at B'nai
B'ritb. Hail last evening was marked by
only one exciting incident, when James
Boland vociferously denounced the action
of Delegate Cahill at a previous meeting,
in referring to the Board of Health, as a
"lot of dirty dogs" and asked that the
association take the proper steps to inform
the board that this was only an individual
opinion.
J. W. McGuire thought the bringine
forward of the matter ill-timed, as the
Board of Health snould be given credit
with having sense enough not to blame
the organization for the utterance of one
member. Tne affair was happily settled
by Cahill vehemently denying that he had
used such an expression in referring to the
board, and stating that only one paper
had been so unfair as to misquote him.
President Pheian stated for the Street
Committee that he had met three of the
Park Commissioners in conjunction with
Superintendent McLaren, and that the
probability is that the Board of Supervisors
will co-operate with them in seeing that
trees are planted on Golden Gate avenue
from Van Ness avenue westward. Mc-
Laren offered to supply the trees.
Attorney L. L. Samuels reported that
the association had virtually accomplished
its work against the Geary-street fran
chise, as by the law the Board of Super
visors could take no action ninety days
prior to the coming election nor seventy
days thereafter. His remarks elicited
abundant applause. Those who have
worked the hardest in this objection to
the Geary-street franchise are Dr. Rot
tanzi, I. Schwartz, F. W. McEwen and
Goorge Fletcher.
The report of the committee on consti
tutional amendment 1 ureed all members
to use their influence against the amend
ment on the ground that it would release
mortgages from taxation, and thus throw
the whole burden on the owner of the
property.
The secretary of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, S. H. Tacey,
by invitation spoke of the benefits done
the State at large and the City in particu
lar by the Mechanics' Fair.
He introduced his remarks by stating
that the present industrial depression
must have a cause, and that in his opinion
it was largely due to iack of patronage of
home industry. In bis address he showed
how the creation of a home market would
benefit every interest in the State, and he
referred to the recent fair as an example
ot what the State could do in supplying
the wants of purchasers.
At tiie close of his remarks Secretary
Tacey was given a vote of thanks, and a
resolution was entered by Dr. Saltield and
unanimously adopted that the members
use only Californian goods when the quali
ties and prices correspond with imported
articles. George Raabe thought that little
could be accomplished without the co
operation of the ladies, who, he said, gen
erally bought goodÃ thoughtlessly.
A delegate thought that the Hnrbor
Commissioners should be petitioned to
use only home-made wagÂ«ns for sprink
ling street?, and that the wholesale dealers
should have their attention drawn to the
matter of patronizing home industry.
Regarding the latter clause Tacey said
steps were now being taken to do so.
The School Directors fell in for their
share of blame in not awarding contracts
for blackboards to local manufacturers,
and President Pheian also thought
pressure should be brought on architects
to use California marble in the erection of
buildings. Home products were said to
cost more in some cases, owing to the ex
travagant prices of railroad transporta
tion. ______________

TEACHERS' PAY MAY
BE HELD OUT
The Board of Education
in an Economical
Mood.
Salaries of Some Employes May
Be Reduced to Head Off
a Deficit.
FUNDS ABE THOUSANDS SHORT
Retrenchments Decided On AH Along
the Line to Keep Within the
Appropriation.
The probabilities are that, tbe Board of
Education will find it necessary before the
close of the present fiscal year to ask the
teachers of the School Department to help
it out by foregoing a certain amount of
their salaries until the funds are in better
condition. It is also quite possible that
some of the employes will lose a portion
of their salaries entirely, and it is within
the range of possibility that strict econ
omy will necessitate the dismissal of a
few.
The board, held a special session last
evening to discuss ways and means of
meeting the grave financial situation that
now confronts it.
At the last meetiug of the board Director
Murdock offered a resolution calling at
tention to the fact that in order to keep
within the amount allowed the depart
ment by the Board of Supervisors ex
penses must be cut or a deficit faced in or
der to tide over the year, and it was then
decided to discuss the matter in special
session.
The $1,000,000 allowed the department
last year was sufficient to pay ail expenses
and leave a surplus, and on the strength
ox this the Supervisors fixed the school
appropriation for this year at a like
amount for general purposes in spite of
the fact that $1,250,000 was asked for. The
$200,000 appropriated for the Mission High
School building can be used for no other
purpose.
Now the board finds that with the heavy
contracts it has already made for altera
tions and improvements on school build
ings it will be many thousands short
before the end of the year and the problem
is to find a way out of the difficulty.
When the meeting was called to order
last evening Director Murdock called at
tention to the fact that unless expenses
were curtailed in some manner a deficit
was sure to show itself before the close of
the year. He suggested, during the course
of his remarks, that there were certain
employes whose salaries had recently
been raised, and that, as their previous
pay had been sufficient, these might prop
erly be reduced to their former figure as a
starter.
Another member suggested that, as on
former occasions, teachers! had consented
to allow a portion of their salaries to hold
over until the funds warranted a full
amount being paid, this course might be
followed again.
Director Murdock said that tbe most
important matters to be discussed were:
1. What action can be taken by the board to
restrict the miscellaneous expenditures to the
lowest possible sum consistent with the wants
of the schools and to restrict committees to
purchases or expenditures approved or au
thorized by a majority of the board.
2. To what extent the expenditures for
special teachers can be reduced without se
rious disadvantage to the schools.
3. What consolidation of classes can be ju
diciously made.
4. Is it advisable to Increase the number of
pupils in any of the classes?
5. Whether the salaries of janitors may be
reduced without Injustice.
6. Wnether the inevitable deficit, should
the schools be continued tor the year, shali be
met by a reduction of the salary schedule or
by witholding a portion of the vacation sal
ary.
7. If by a reduction of salaries, to submit a
schedule that by rigid economy in other di
rections may enable us to continue the schools
for the year within the appropriation.

SLEEPY DAYS FOR
CHAIRMAN ALFORD
Tantalizing Visions Haunt
the Democratic
Leader.
In a Dream the Young Manager
of the Campaign Sees
Pleasant Things.
IMAGINES BUDD ON THE STUMP
Fruitless Hopes for a Repetition of
That Famous Buck board Tour.
Other Phantoms Fade.
Hon. W. H. Aiford, chairman of the
Democratic State Committee, had another
quiet day yesterday. In fact all days at
the Democratic State headquarters are
marked by a Jack of that stir and bustle
The Boy Manager of the Boy Orator's Campaign Dreams of
Impossibilities*
and life that usually characterize a place
of that kind during the progress of a Pres
idential campaign.
Mr. Aiford is popularly known "as the
boy manager of the boy orator's cam
paign in California," but for all his popu
larity, his urbanity and his conceded
ability to entertain visitors as "a single
handed talker," Mr. Aiford does not ap
pear to be able to draw together a satisfac
tory crowd of prominent or influential
Democratic politicians. This is not the
fault of Mr. Aiford. It is not because of
the lack of personal magnetism on his
part, but results simply from the fact that
the brainy men of the Democratic party,
those upon whom dependence â  for victory
has hitherto been placed, are no longer
willing to put their shoulders to the
wheel, when to do so would be to advance
the cause of Bryanism, with which they
have little or no sympathy. There is an
other reason. They do not believe that
Bryan can be elected and therefore have
no personal interest in his canvass. .
In the still watches of the day, overcome
by the soporific influences of the drowsy at
mosphere, Mr. Aiford yesterday indulged
himself in a siesta, during which his oft
repeated wishes took the form of a vision.
The alluring mirage of dreamland con
jured ud a great many delightful scenes
that, alas, are to exist merely as the
phantasms of an overstrained imagina
tion. For instance, it seemed to "the boy
manager of the boy orator's campaign in
California ' that Governor Jim' Budd had
started to make a tour of the State, intend
ing to duplicate his famous buckboard cam
paign, taking for his slogan, "Bryan and
-.Free Silver," with unrestricted coinage of
sophomoric eloquence on the side. The
vision pictured Senator Steve White act
ing as Governor Budd's advance ager-t,
j> building bonfires and putting up posters
and pictures of Bryan. For the moment
dull care was dispelled by this beauteous
apocalypse, ana Mr. Alford forgot that
Senator White has gone to the Colorado
Canyon for a hunting and fishing trip,
while Governor Budd can find very little
time to devote to National politics.
John H. Wise, the influential Collector
of -Customs for this port, Internal Reve
nue Collector Welbnrn and Postmaster
Frank McCoppin appeared to the en
raptured senses of Mr. Alvord as a trinity
of ministering angels, carrying the glad
tidings of Bryanism to. Democratic house
holds throughout the length and breadth
of the land; yet had he been aroused
from his lethargy at that moment Mr.
Aiford would have recalled the fact that
he had not been able -to induce any of
those gentlemen to fill appointments at
trie many important point 3 throughout
the State where public speakers werar actu
ally needed to stem the current of public
opinion that is setting so strongly for Me
â¢ Kinley, and which threatens to over
"' whelm the disorganized and faint-hearted
Bryan forces, turning their certain defeat
into a disastrous lout. . ' < . â¢ â 
Anon the elusive and mischief-loving
elves of dreamland whispered to Mr. Al
ford that he might have the powerful in
fluence of the venerable warhorse, Bill
English, enlisted on behalf- of the boy or
ator, at the same time obscuring the stern
fact that Mr. English, like the other
brainy men of his party, is too much oc
cupied with personal affairs to give even a
moment's consideration to the interests of
Mr. Bryan, the eloquent young man from
the shallow Platte. iÂ¥-V"". '
Then from the dream, as from a bowl of
poppy juice, arose the radiant apparition
of "Hon. J. J.Dwyer, and it seemed to the
distempered imagination of , Mr. : Aiford
that this new-fledged member of . the
Democratic National Committee . was ca
vorting wildly through the interior of â the
State, anxiously looking â¢ for . an oppor
tunity to fill some of the aching voids that
exist on the Democratic rostrums through
out the land. But Mr. Dwyer has no such
, inclination. His law practice is growing tp
an alarming degree, and: it appears more
: than probable that it will monopolize his
valuable time from the present date to the
3d of next month.
Although the venturesome genius of Mr.
Alford's dream even painted Colonel John
P. Irish in the act of making a speech in
< favor -of Bryan, even after â  the eloquent
Naval Officer had denounced the Chicago
nominee and bis platform as un-American
and un-Democratic. yet it seems that the
laws of extravagance have some limit, for
there was no suggestion that Millionaire
Jimmy Phelan, Democratic nominee for
Mayor of San Francisco, has any sympa
thy with the head of his National ticket.
Mr. Phelan has repeatedly accentuated
his position in favor of the sound-money
standard, sharing the counsels of such men
as ex-Mayor E. B. Pond, Colonel John P.
Irish and other leaders of like mental cali
ber and executive ability.
All the way from the southern part of
the State came trooping swarms of Demo
cratic phantoms, ostensibly bent on taking
the stump for Bryan and free silver, but
they all appeared to balk before reaching
the goal ol their ambition, so it became
necessary to import speakers from Utah,
Oregon ana Missouri, in order to maintain
a semblance of carrying on with anything
like proper continuity the oft wanted, but
hitherto abortive "campaign of educa
tion."
Thus Mr. Alford's vision ambled on,
from delusion to delusion, holding out
hopes {impossible of fulfillment, until the
janitor startled him with a noisy obtru
sion and an announcement that it was
time to clean up the rooms.
Feeling like a modernized copy of Rip
Van Winkle the boy manager of the boy
orator's campaign in California brushed
from His arm the cobwebs with which the
weaving spider sought to inclose him, and
passed out upon the street, bitteriy reflect
ing on the wise proverb of the ancients
that "dreams go by contraries."
In the outer office of the Democratic
State headquarters there was, however,
an actual show of activity. A charming
young person had been engaged to operate
the typewriting machine, and she sat in
her place, hour after hour, alert and ex
pectant, seemingly much disappointed be
cause she had nothing to do. But Mr.
Aiford could not be blamed, for if he had
no letters to write there certainly was no
good reason -for spoiling white paper with
useless analine.
The solitary clerk in the secretary's de
partment was just as buÂ«y as he was the
day before. He had nothing to do.
In the annex of the headquarters, the
room in which the Hon. Frank Gould as
chairman of the old Democratic State
Central Committee ruled in favor of Gavin
McNab and the Junta as against Andy
Clunie and the Buckley "push,' 1 three
efficient porters were eDgaged in packing
campaign documents to be sent out by
mail to different parts of the State. These
documents consisted mainly of Bryan's
Chicago speecn, with the borrowed passage
about 'pressing down a crown of thorns
on a cross of gold," marked in blue pencil.
The men were too attentive to duty, for
they soon worked themselves out of a job
by depleting the stock of documents at
their disposal.
The situation in the Democratic State
Committee headquarters may be said to
aptly typify the political situation through
out the State. Democratic politicians are
not noted for exerting themselves except
they see something in it for themselves.
They evidently do not believe that .Bryan
will ever be elected to reward them for
any exertions they may put forward in
bis behalf. This accounts for the apathy
of the leading Democrats of California.
With them it is simply a case of "no pay,
no play."
STRIKE IN THE MALONEY
The Owners Now Sacking Ore
and Putting Up a Plant
of Machinery.
Unusual Activity in the Mines of
Calaveras â Arrival of Two
Valuable Gold Bricks.
W. H. Hooper, superintendent of the
Foisom mine, north of Angels, is at the
Grand. He says a rich strike of quartz
has been struck in the Maloney mine, ad
j joining the old mine belonging to the
| James G. Fair estate, over which there
has been litigation for some time, and that
it is apparently one of the most important
discoveries made in Calaveras for some
time.
"The strike is so good," he said, "that
for some time the owners have been em
ploying about twenty men sacking the
ore and sending it to this City. Tne'dis
covery was made, as I understand, about
forty or fifty feet from the surface.
"The owners are now putting up a
plant of machinery, consisting of hoisting
works and other apparatus, preparatory
to sinking in the vein. As yet the mine
has no mill of its own. It is said the ore
is very rich.
"There-is a great deal of activity among
the mines in that part of Calaveras. Old
mines are being opened, and there is a
good deal of prospecting work throughout
the hills. A good many young men from
Pan Francisco ard other places have gone
there and have taken up mining as a busi
ness. They have become convinced that
the mines offer them better inducements
than the city.
"The owners of the Thorp mine are go
ing to sink again. They are down about
500 feet and have reached a large vein.
The ore in some places runs from $5 to $7
a ton. I have never seen the outlook for
mining brighter than it is now in Cala
veras. There is general interest in it and
energetic work. I look for a good many
important discoveries.
"W. A. Nevils, Mrs. Nevils and two
guards came down to-day on the stage.
Mr. Nevils brought $80,000 with him in
two gold bricks. The guards were Mc-
Connell and Hendricks. Mr. Hendricksis
the guard who killed the stage-robber near
Aneels some three years ago. He is an
old messenger of Wells. Fargo & Co."
Mr. Hooper has a five-stamp mill and a
force of nine men on the' Foisom mine.
Jnst now he is doing development work
and opening up the property.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1896.
KELLY ON TRIAL
FOR HIS LIFE
Charged With the Willful
Murder of Soldier
Quinn.
Story of the Crime Committed at
Fort Mason in July
Last.
A JURY HAS BEEN SECURED.
What the Prosecuting Attorney Says
He Can Prove Against the
Prisoner.
The trial of James Kelly, charged with
the murder of Joseph E. Quinn, was yes
terday begun before Judge Hunt.
Kelly and Quinn were both United
States soldiers, and on the evening of July
10 last Quinn was killed. In the after
noon he had been engaged in a contro
versy with Kelly. The trouble occurred
at Fort Mason, and is said to have origi
nated over a woman.
The District Attorney, in his opening
address to the jury, claimed he will prove
that just before the murder Kelly ap
proached Quinn, as he stood on the parade
ground, and renewed the quarrel. Sud
denly Kelly advanced with uplifted arm
and grasped his victim, who an instant
later called "He's killed me," and fell to
the ground in a dying condition. Kelly
then ran to his quarters and was found
there in a bed soon after.
When spoken to about the crime he
claimed to know nothing of it and to have
been in bed all the while. Blood was
found upon his hands, however, and he
could give no explanation as to how it got
there. A razor, which has been identified
as similar to one used by Kelly, was sub
sequently found near where Quinn met his
death.
All of yesterday was consumed in ob
taining a jury and by the Prosecuting
Attorney's address. The taking of testi
mony will begin to-day.
Following are the names of the jury
men obtained: Soren Jessen, J. W. Pence,
H. Larsen, A. W. Martin, R. C. Ulackmar,
J. A. W. Harned, George Berbert, H. F.
Williams, John Nagle, W. C. Nichols,
George B. Chenowith and Edward J.

Republican Gains in the East
to Be Duplicated
Here.
Butterworth of Ohio and Schoonmaker
of New Jersey to Speak Next
Saturday.
The telegraphed reports from Connecti
cut and elsewhere showing unprecedented
Republican gains and unprecedented
Democratic losses in the local elections
have hung the rooms of the Silver and
Democratic committees with spiritual
crape, and have garlanded the beadauar
quarters of the Republican State Central
Committee with the flowers of rejoicing.
Chairman McLaugh lin, after his visit
to tbe sun-kissed sands of Santa Oruz,
needed only the election news to make
him perfectly happy, and Secretary Hig
gins ceased yawning and laid aside his
worried expression as he traced the itiner
ary ot an eloquent speaker through the
tortuous chapparal of Grub Gulch to the
alkali-blistered dwellers on the edge of
Death Valley.
Jake Steppacber smiled and remarked
that he had thought so all along. ' This
remark broke the record for Jake, he being
tbe most taciturn politician on the coast
outside of a deaf and dumb asylum.
Visitors to headquarters from the coun
try continue to arrive bearinggood tidings.
E. A. 'Hayes of Santa Clara reports the
watchword of that county to be "prunes
and protection." Santa Clara will give a
rousing majority for McKinley.
F. Wickersham of Sonoma County re
ports Republicanism in that fertile land
as being in good shape to march to victory
behind the banner of protection.
There will be several very interesting
meetings during the remainder of tbe
week. There will be a big crowd on Satur
day night in the Pavilion to hear the
speeches of Benjamin Butterworth of Ohio
and F. X. Schoonmaker of New Jersey,
Doth of whom are reputed to be eloquent
men.
On Friday night the Ladies' Annex of
the National Republican League will meet
in the League's rooms in the Pioneer
Building and will be addressed by Edgar
Peixotto and Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn.
There will be singing and music also.
On the same evening tbe. Continental
League will meet in Saratoga Hail and
will be entertained by prominent speakers.

A communication from Oakland invited
the comrades to visit that city to-night

Addresses were made by Colonel J. J.
Lyons, Colonel Blackburn and Andy
Branch, who came at the request of a
Democrat to give his reasons for being a
Republican, he having belonged to a
Southern Democratic family. Mr. Branch
did give his reasons in one of his flowery
speeches, with the result of making some
converts to the cause of McKinley and pro
tection.
Songs, reoitations and refreshments
closed the evening.

DEMOCRATS TALK SILVER
Mass- Meeting in Metropolitan
Hall With Budd in the
Chair.
Hs Excellency Is Received With Great
Enthusiasm and Speaks iv a
Happy Vein.
Metropolitan Hall was crowded last
nirnt on the occasion of a Democratic
mass-meeting to whoop- up silver.
When Governor Budd appeared he was
eiven a hearty reception. He said he ap
peared to testify his appreciation of the
services of Judge Lawler.who did so much
for him, and also for the committee over
which he presides. The Governor said:
"I was asked why I presided over a silver
meeting. My answer was: *L would pre
side at a Salvation Army meeting if it was
for silver.'
The band played a National air and J.
W. Wright was introduced as a Bryan Re
publican, while the house gave three
hearty cheers for Governor Budd.
Mr. Wright read something from one of
Bryan's speeches, which he called "a mes
sage from our next President."
A quartet sane a free-silver song at 16 to
1, and for an encore gave a little melody,
which was warmly applauded.
James H. Barry of the Star was intro
duced, and the audience went wild with
enthusiasm in its ovation to him. He
began by saying he was glad to see such
an audience before him, an audience that
showed its love of liberty.
"The last National Democratic Conven
tion," he said, "was the greatest one ever
held ; it boldly declared for silver at 16 to
1: it criticized the Supreme Court of the
United States; it declared for civil and re
ligious liberty, and particularly it declared
against the A. Jf. A., and what is of great
est interest to this coast it declared against
the funding bill.
"It is objected that the free coinage of
silver will flood this country. The mints
of this country can coin but $50,000,000 a
year. Now, I would like to know what
fear there is of inflation? I know we
would be abie to carry a little more silver,
and be glad to carry all we can get.
"We say equal rights to all, special
privileges to none; but there can be no
such thing as equal rights when men are
refused the opportunity to earn a liveli
hood by their labor. With free silver we
will take the stronghold in which special
privileges are entrenched. William J.
Bryan, if you do your duty, will be the
next President of the United States. In
the American Federation of Labor, which
has a membership of 1,260,000 men, I do
not believe that one single member will
vote for McKinley. Of all the pilgrimages
to Canton I do not believe that there has
been one union man among them, nor
one labor union. 1 have this from Henry
George, that the workingmen in the East
are without exception almost solid for
Bryan."
W. W..Foote began by stating that two
years ago he stood on the* same platform
speaking for a gallant young statesman,
Governor Budd. "The time looked dark,
but we elected our man," he continued,
"and lam on the same identical mission
to-night, to speak for another gallant
young statesman, William J. Bryan, and
we will elect him. I have been introduced
as an anarchist. If supporting the Demo
cratic National platform makes me an
anarchist then I am an anarchist, and you
can make what you like of me."
The speaker turned his attention to the
Southern Pacific Company and declared
it has done more to debauch legislatures,
courts, reputations than all the other evil
influences of the State combined. The
railroad should be made to pay its debts
according to the letter of the law. One of
the best speeches made in Congress
against the funding bill was one made by
a young Congressman from Nebraska â
William Jennings Bryan. The railroad
knew that if a Congressman who fought
the funding bill were elected President the
funding bill would be in still graver dan
ger.
Commemoration Ball.
Next Sunday the Garibaldi Guard Mutual
Aid Society will give a grand ball at Garibaldi
Hall, 423 Broadway, in commemoration of the
discovery of America.
Municipal Ownership.
j The provisions in t the ''\ new charter ; bearing
upon municipal ownership of public utilities
have been so much discussed that Dr. Jerome
A. Anderson has consented \to speak to-night
upon this subject at Academy of Sciences Hall,
819 Market street. Dr. Anderson was? one of

JAIL-BREAKERS
FOILED BY A WIFE
Three Burglars Were to
Make Use of the
Police Parade.
Furnished With a False Key to
Open the Door of the
City Prison.
HOW THE SCHEME WAS TO WOEK
The Discovery Made by the Spouse
of One of the Trio Belli; Seea
Passing Him a Package.
A most ingenious, easily executed
scheme concocted by three burglars now
awaiting their preliminary examination
in the City Prison to make their escape
Mrs, Josic Kelly, the Woman Through Whom an Attempted Jailbreak
Failed Yesterday, and the Keys and Files Which Played
an Important Part in the Burglars' Plot.
was frustrated yesterday afternoon by the
merest accident.
The three burglars are Patrick Kelly,
Ed Conn, alias Frank Martin, and Wil
liam Corbett, alias William Gallagher,
alia-: Edward Lynch, all ex-convicts.
Keliy and Cohn were arrested on Aug
ust 22 and Corbett two days later, but they
were not booked till September 4.
They were the three men who com
mitted numerous burglaries on Nob Hill
and the two charges on which they were
booked were for robbing the residences of
W. S. Duval, 1012 Pine street, on the
night of August 2, and the residence of A.
O. Holtrick, 1022 "Washington street, on
August 4. Cohn is believed to be the
man who entered the residence of Captain
Lees, 1022 Pine street, in the early morn
ing of August 22, but being observed by
Policeman Ingham he hastily made his
escape by a rear window and by climbing
the fences till he reached Taylor street
At the time Kelly and Cohn were ar
rested in a room on Grant avenue a
woman with whom Kelly was living was
also arrested. She claimed she was Kel
ly's wife, and gave the name of Josie
Kelly. She was detained for a few days
and was released.
The cases were assigned to Judge Con
lan's court, and have been dragging along
since September 4. Yesterday the three
men were in court for a few minutes till a
witness was examined, and the woman
Kelly wag there also. She has been visit
ing Kelly almost every day, and when
they left the court she followed them, to
tbe City Prison.
She returned about 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, and Kelly sat down beside her
on a bench in the main corridor reserved
for prisoners and their friends. Police
man Shaw, who is the prison doorkeeper
and has his desk in the main corridor, ob
served the woman slip two packages into
his hands and another package into the
waist on nis trousers. He at once notified
Captain Robinson, and the captain on
searching Kelly found two packages of
opium in his pocket. He searched for the
other package and gave Kelly a shake,
and a key with shoulders at both ends
dropped on the floor from the leg of his
trousers. â¢
The captain saw at once that the key
was an exact imitation of the key for
opening the prison door, and it flashed
into bis mind that the woman was a party
to a scheme for a break from the prison.
Kelly denied that the woman gave the
key to him and she was also loud in her
denials, but she confessed that she gave
him a package of opium. She was booked
ou the charge ol passing opium to a
prisoner, but a more serious charge may
be registered against her.
Captain Robinson tried to open the
prison door with the false key, but it did
not work. It is too wide by about the
thirtieth part of an inch; otherwise it is a
perfect imitation. It is made of a square
piece of galvanized zinc and the space be
tween the two shoulders is soldered.
How Kelly succeeded in getting such an
exact imitation of the door-key without
getting an impression of it is a mystery.
The key never leaves the hands of the door
keepers day or nirht, the one passing it to
the other when relieved from duty. Kelly
has been in the prison for six weeks and
as the woman called upon him very fre
quently he bad ample opportunity of
studying the door-key. The probabilty is
that he drew a sketch of it from the im
pression on his mind and gave it to the
woman, who had the false kay made by a
locksmith.
The cell occupied by the three prisoners,
which is known as the hole in tne wall,
was examined and two files made of gal
vanized iron were found in it. The hies
had been given to Kelly apparently to
help him make a key if the woman had
been unsuccessful in getting a locksmith
to do the job.
After the excitement had subsided
Captain Robinson ordered Kelly placed
in a cell oy himself, and had a talk with
him. Kelly confessed the whole scheme.
He admitted that the woman gave him
the key, thinking that she could not be
punished for it, but denied that she gave
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
him any opium, as he knew that was a
misdemeanor. The woman had, however,
confessed she gave him the opium, but de
nied giving him the keys.
"The scheme was this," said Kelly.
"We had arranged to make the attempt
to-morrow, when Shaw was on the door.
I knew Hickey and Corbett knows Par
rotte, so we did not want to injure t!iem.
A friend was to call for me. While 1
would be talking to him on the bench, an
other friend was to call for Corbett. Then
another friend was to call for Colvin, and
while Shaw was away opening the cell to
let Colvin out I was to open the prison
door with the false key and Corbett and I
would get away. We were to leave the
door open ana Colvin as soon as Shaw
opened the cell door was to make a run
for the open door and get away."
It would have been a simple matter for
Kelly and Corbett to escape, as they
would have had nobody to interfere with
them, but Colvin had to take the chance
of the "trusties" giving the alarm. Shaw
and tbe other doorkeepers are unarmed
for prudential reasons, as a desperate
criminal might take the revolver from
them and cause trouble while visiting tbe
cells, so Colvin know he had nothing to
fear from him.
The time was well planned, as the police
parade is to take place this afternoon, and
there might have been a scarcity of offi
cers at the Central police station.
No weapon was found upon either of the
three prisoners or in their cell, but it is
suspected that Josie Kelly, if the discovery
of the key had not been made, would
have tried to pass a revolver to Kelly to
day before the attempt was made.
Kelly, besides the two charges of burg*
lary, has charges of assault to murder
and robbery to answer for. He robbed a
stranger named Casbin in a house on
Howard street, near Third, and fired a
shot at him, wounding him in the leg a
few days before he was arrested for bur
glary. He was first sentenced on June 1,
1885, to six months in the House of Cor
rection for petty larceny. On February 9,
1887, he got two years in San Quentin for
burglary and after that he served several
terms for petty larceny and burglary.
Colvin was sent to San Quentin for three
years on May 18, 1893, for grand larceny
and on November 5, 1895, he got three
months in the House of Correction for
having burglars' tools in his possession.
Corbett, when 14 years of age, was sent
to the Industrial School for three months.
On May 15, 1880, he was sent to San Quen
tin for burglaiy. In 1888, while serving a
term in the House of Correction ha made
his escape. On November 14, 1889, he was
sent to San Quentin for robbing a stage in
Mendocino County.
MIDWEEK THEATER MOTES
The "Prisoner of Zenda" Has
Quite Captured Baldwin
Audiences.
11 Trilby" at the Columbiaâ A Pleasing
New Soubrette at the
Tivoli.
The Baldwin Theater could scarcely
have opened more auspiciously than it
has done with "The Prisoner of Zenda."
It is a play that interests most classes of
theater goers, its romantic side appeals to
people who like a touch of poetry in their
theatrical amusements, and its stirring
melodramatic situations are racy enough
to keep the most blase attention engaged.
As to the performance little can be
added to the praise which was bestowed
on it after the opening night. James
Hackett is a young actor of remarkable
talent, who makes careful character
studies of each individual part in his
triple role. Isabel Irving is a graceful,
sympathetic Princess; Flavia and the rest
of the cast are entirely satisfactory. The
large houses at the Baldwin show that
"The Prisoner of Zenda" has "caughton."
The audiences at the Alcazar are steadily in-
Creasing in size,as the performances merit that
they should, lhis week an interesting double
bill is presented and both the play and the
curtain-raiser are well acted and artistically
staged. Buckstoue's farcical comedy, "Mar
ried Life," is particularly well acted, all the
couples throwing themselves into their parts
with spirit and intelligence.
"Trilby" is drawing good houses at the Co*
lumbia Theater. The performance has not
changed much since the play was first pre
sented here, in spite of the alterations in the
cast.
AugUÃtin Daly's adaptation iroia the Gor
man, "The Big Bonanza," is providing plenty
of amusement for audiences at the Grand this
week. Stock well is in his element as the guile
less professor, who dabbles in stocks, and the
rest of the cast is iv good hands.
"Satanella" Is by no means a novelty at the
Tivoliâ indeed, the lady who demonstrated
the power of lore is almost as good a standby
at the local home of opera as Balfe's "Old
Girl" of Bohemian notoriety herself.
The cast this week is uneven. The people
who are good are very good and the people
who are bad are horrid. Fortunately, the
good largely predominate. Abramoff, who is
an artist to his finger-tips, makes a fine
demon King, and John J. Raffael and his
pirate band do themselves proud, particularly
in the scene on the seashore. Elvira Crox
Seabrook, the new soubrette, acts with the
sprightliness and vim ol her calling, and her
voice is o: a ringing sweet quality, which is
rare indeed among iadies of the soubrette per-
Buasion. It is safe to predict a successful
career for her at the Tivoli. The other parts
in "Satanella" are satisfactorily taken with
the exception of Leila and Stella. The lady
who played the latter role has all the trade
marks of the amateur.
The Orpheum's bill thU week is drawing
well, as most of the Orpheum'a bills do. Ger
tie Cochran, the memory child, is as great a
wonder of self-possession as she is of memory.
Woe betide the unhappy spectator who sets a
catch question for this infant phenomenon
for judging from what she has already done
this week sue will surely humble dim in the
eyes of the audience. The armless wonder
continues to delude people into the belief that
his feet are hands, and the rest of the per
formance, though consisting of hold-overs, is
well worth hearing. *
The first concert in the Hinrich-Beei series
will open in the Baldwin Theater to-morrow
week.

MILESTONE PASSED
Officials Return From
Fresno and Continue
Their Work.
They Were Wholly Surprised
at the Splendid Reception
Given Them.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC CUTS AGAIN
Claus Spreckels, President of the
People's Line, the Man of the
Hour in the Valley.
At the main offices of the San Francisco
and San Joaqum Valley Railway yester
day the business of constructing and
operating was goin~ on as if nothing had
occurred to break its continuity. Chief
Engineer Storey was at his desk studying
over new depot and roundhouse struc
tures, and betterments of the line from
Stockton to Fresno. Vice-President Robert
Watt and Director A. H. Payaon were at
work, and they spent a long time confer
ring with the chief engineer on various
matters of immediate importance to the
people's railway, which has lifted the San
Joaquin Valley out of bondage. Secretary
Alexander Macfcie was as busy as a bee
directing affairs in his department.
They had all returned from Fresno,
where they participated in the greatest
celebration the valley has ever seen, and
naturally were full of pardonable pride
and the spirit of enthusiasm that proved
so infectious amonir farmers and shippers
in connection with the entry of the first
train of the San Francisco and San Joa
quin Valley road into Fresno.
There was no boasting, however, no dis
play over the great good that had been ac
complished for California, but instead, it
was all business. Ti.e officials worksd
liked business men, and now that one
milestone was passel they were looking
ahead to the next one.
Speaking of the reception at Fresno,
Secretary Mackie said it far exceeded the
expectations of the Valley road builders.
"That picture in this morning's Call,"
said he, '"is a good one. It is exactly as
the scene appeared to us when we got into
Fresno. I never saw anything like the
crowd that was there to greet us. The
picture was from a photograph. As far as
the eye could see there was nothing but
heads and waving hats, find beyond the
tremendous gathering we could see more
people arriving in bungies, buckboards,
wagons and thousands on foot. Where
they all came from is a mystery.
"None of us on the train expected to wit
ness such a bight. The vast concourse of
people cheered and waved hats and hand
kerchiefs as the first train came in to
Fresno. No doubt about it, the people of
the valley showed in royal style how sin
cerely they appreciated the arrival of that
train and all it meant for them."
Engineer Storey stated that regular
communication with Fresno would ba
kept up daily. A freight train and pÃs
sencer coach will run between the present
terminus of the Jine, and as soon as the
depot is finished at Stockton and other
accommodations for paseengers are com
plete daily passenger trains will run, con
necting with the fast boats of the Cali
fornia Navigation Company at Stockton
for through passage to San Francisco.
Director Watt was asked if construction
would be continued southward from
Fresno.
"Not for the present," he answered,
"that is altogether a question of bonds
now and we wont do anything in that di
rection until after the election. A great
deal depends, of course, on the result of
the election, ana should things come as
we anticipate we shall lose no time in con
tinuing tne construction of the road."
It was iearned yesterday that the South
ern Pacific Company had Introduced an
other reduction of passenger fares in the
San Joaquin Valley. Some time ago that
company was compelled to make sweep
ing reductions in freight ratÂ»s and passen
ger fares as far 9outh as Fresno, because
its monopoly was broken by tho Valley
road. Freights were cut to correspond
with each new reduced tariff of the Valley
road until freights went lower than those
recentiy set by the State Railroad Com
missioners and passenger fares were cut
from 4 and 5 cents to 3 cents a mile, to
'equalize them."
On September 1 the Southern Pacific
Company very quietly reduced it fares
southward on its eastern road via Porier
viile to Poso. The old rate was 5 cents a
mile, now the passenger pays but 3 cents
to Poso junction, a short distance north of
Bakersheld. The reason given is that those
fares needed "equalizing." So the Valley
road has proved itself an accomplished
"equalizer" in this respect.
Ihose who accompanied the Valley road
excursion train to Fresno declare that the
most popular and most highly and widely
respected man in the whole San Joaquin
Valley ia Ciaus Spreckels, the man who
made the Valley road the great enterprise
it is to-day, and as president of the com
pany, shattered the monopoly that op
pressed the best portion of California.
THE LABOR UNIONS.
Journeymen Shoemakers Active in the
kÂ» Home Industry Cause.
Many members of the laDor unions are
preparing for the labor law convention
that is to be held next Sunday at 915%
Market street. By the time the meeting
convenes the delegates from the various
labor organizations will have prepared a
number of suggestions for the improve
ment of the present and the formation of
new labor Jaws that will be presented to
the next State Legislature. Last night
the Journeymen Barbers' Local Union 27
elected I. Less, T. Rodr.gues and W. West
man as delegates to the convention.
The Pacific Coast Shoeworkers' Union is
making fine headway in its home-industry
movement.
At the meeting last evening the report
was made that the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association's trademark,
which has been adopted by the union, is
now being placed on the goods of nearly
all of the local shoe factories, and that
nearly all late orders are for goods bear
ing this stamp. There are now fifty-eight
manufacturers of all kinds of goods and
products using this trademark.
The members of the union are agitating
the home-products question, and will not
accept anything unless it is known to be
of California make. It is the intention to
get up a federation of home product manu
facturers, and make special efforts to push
their wares in the market.
The Labor Bureau Association, head
quarters at 915)4 Market street, is prepar
ing for a grand ball to be held in Union
square Half on the 17th inst. The associa
tion has a very large membership ana its
reading-rooms are well filled every even
/ ing. In fact, the bureau is a sort of Dome
I for single workmen and a rendezvous for
married men. One of the missions of the
association is to find employment for its
unemployed members. It is to replenish
its treasury that the entertainment is be
ing arranged.

WILLIAM P. COLEMAN.
The Chairman of the Klainath Reserva
tion Commission Arrives ia
Town.
William P. Coleman of St. Louis is the
guest of Major R. P. Hammond and of his
brothers, Evan J. and Barry Coleman,
during his brief stay in this City. Mr.
Coleman is chairman of a commission ap
pointed by the Secretary of the Interior to
visit the Klamath Indian Reservation for
the purpose of defining the boundaries of
the reservation and of settling a long
standing dispute between the Indians and
the set Hers.
The matter of the appointment of a
commission was brought up by Mitchell
of Oregon, who introduced a resolution in
to that purport. The other
members of the commission are R. P.
Hammond of this City and J. Applegate
of Klamath Palls. Mr. Applegate is a
surveyor well acquainted with the topo
graphy of that country, and his knowl
edge and experience will be of great assist
ance to the commission.
The point in dispute is as to whether
certain lands belong to the Indians or to
the State. The land in dispute is of large
area and is mostly occupied by settlers
who made their homes there in good
faith.
Mr, Coleman formerly resided in this
State. He is delighted with the climate
and will remain here during the rest of
the week. Next week the commission will
leave for the reservation and will make a
thorough survey of the territory. They
have no time to lose for they must hnish
their work before the winter sets in.
THEY WAITED TAXPAYERS
Democratic Politicians Address
the Election Commis
sioners.
Suggestions That Were Not Accepted
Republican O.ficers Appointed
Yesterday.
A coterie of Democratic politicians made
another effort yesterday at the meeting of
the Election Commissioners, to have all
election officers chosen from the rolls of
the Tax Collector, but they were turned
down by the Commissioners, who showed
them the absolute impracticability of such
a measure.
When the meeting was called to order
J. J. Dwyer, W. H. Alford, M. F. Tarpey,
Eugene Deuprey and Max Popper ap
peared to argue the matter, Mr. Dwyer
acting as spokesman.
lie called attention to the frauds of the
past and said the only way to secure an
honest election was to hava the ballots
counted by men of standing â taxpayers.
"It would take 365 days, working four
hours a aay and devoting rive minutes to
eac h name to carry out your plan," said
Mr. Creswell, Beside that the lists of tax
payers at our disposal are old, one-third oi
the names have been removed, many
names are misspelled and many more are
totally unfitted for use."
The matter rested there, the Board de
clining to act on the suggestion of the
callers.
The following Republican election offi
cers were appointed :

KRIEGER WAS CRUEL.
So the Market-Street Milliner's Wife
Secured a Divorce.
The wife of Byron Krieger, who owns a
half interest in a millinery establishment
at 1010 Market street, yesterday secured a
divorce from him because of the extreme
cruelty with which he has treated her.
It was alleged in the complaint that
only two weeks after their marriage in
1894, Krieger cursed his wife and threat
ened to beat her. This interesting pro
gramme the man milliner has repeated at
frequent intervals ever since, varying it on
one glad Thanksgiving day by seizing a
knife and attempting to end his spouse's
earthly career.

He traveled the long distance from St.
Petersburg over the route of the Great
Siberian Railway in order to personally
inspect it. Prince M. Hilkoff appears to
be about 60 years of age. His hair and
slight beard are gray. He is a very
pleasant gentleman to talk to, being easy
and evidently fully informed of the
exigencies of journalistic interviewing.
He spoke directly concerning what he had
done and what he desired to do.
"As the Minister of Ways and Com
munications, which includes the railways
in my country," said Prince Hilkoff, "I
desired to visit the United States and
Europe and gain what information of
value I could that might be utilized in
Russia. At the same time 1 concluded to
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
make the long trip from St. Petersburg to
Vlad ivostock, while en route here, In
order that I might personally inspect the
Great Siberian road.
"I vas five weeks inspecting this road,
and then a Russian man-of-war conveyed
me and my party from Vladivostock to
Yokahama, where we went aboard the
Belgic.
'â¢The road is in excellent condition. We
traveled on it in some places at a speed of
thirty miles an hour, which is pretty good
for a new road. Our rails had during the
past winter been laid on the ice over rivers
and lakes.
"On some of the branches of the Amoor
River there is some very wild and pic
turesque scenery. Then there are tbe
famed Siberian Steppes, over which we
passed. I think it will prove an excep
tionally attractive line for tourists.
"We have to cross the Bikael Sea, or
lake, by steamer for a distance of 500
miles. We traverse deserts, then stretches
of as fine land as is to be seen in the
world. Besides these there are vast for
ests of magnificent pine, cedar and fir.
We have 4000 miles of navigable rivers
there.
"Between Vladivostock and Khabarofsk
we have 2COO miles of railway transporta
tion, while beyond we have 600 miles
more, and we expect in two years to have
steam communication from Vladivostock
to St. Petersburg. The road as far as
built is in excellent condition."
The Prince says he will only be able to
spend a week or ten days in the United
States. He will visit the Union Iron
Works this morning, where steel barges
are beintr made for the Russian Govern
ment. This afternoon he will visit the
park. At 4 o'clock he will accompany
Charles F. Crocker, Messrs. Kruttschnitt,
Curtis ana others to Sacramento, where he
will examine the Southern Pacific shops.
The railway magnates of the country
have placed special cars at his disposal all
the way across the continent. Mr. Depew
of the New York Central will send his
own magnificent car to receive Prince
Hilkoff and his associates.
For Obstructing the Mailo.
The postal authorities intend to make an ex
ample of Barnldino Campoli, who drives a coal
wagon for Brizzaloni & Son. The new street
mail ears have found great difficulty in mak
ing schedule time owing to the apparent un
willingness of draymen and drivers of ordi
nary vehicles to give them the right of way.
The action of Campoli is what fi nally prompted
the authorities to adopt energetic measures.
On Friday last Cnmpoli was driving a heavily
loaded wagon out Mission. The postal car came
along, but the ariver either did not hear or
would not heed the clanging bell. For nearly
two blocks he kept on the track, finally turn
ing off when near Sixteenth street. Barnidino
Campoli, along with Tomassi Odera, who was
on the wagon at the time, will be arrested to
day and charged with obstructing the mÂ«ils.
Inspector Tnrall has the matter in hand and
is confident of securiug a conviction.
The New Grand Jury.
The impanelment of the new Grand Jury
was finally completed yesterday and its mem
bers, accompanied by District Attorney
Barnes, retired to map out the plan of cam
paign. That their efforts will be directed
mainly to investigating the conduct of certain
City officials was indicated by the fact that
Judge Slack drew special attention in his
charge to the jury to the law requiring that
body to annually Inspect the methods in wnich
City offices are run and to. if necessary, employ
the services ol an expert to go through the
books.
THEY HESITATED
AMD TOOK RISKS
Stanislaus County's Belated
Ticket Is Under
Fire.
Arguments Were Heard by the
Supreme Court Yes
terday.
WHIT OF MANDATE SOUGHT.
The Application Is Deniedâ Stani
Democrats Must Get on by
Petition.
The Supreme Court may decide to-day
whether a writ of mandate shall issue
commanding Albert S. Dingley, County
Clerk of Stanislaus County, to rile the cer
tificate of Democratic nominations in
Stanislaus County. The Justices sat yes
terday in chambers and heard the matter
argued by John E. Richards, who appeared
in opposition to the application for the
writ of mandate, and Judge A. Hewell and
C. A. Stonesifer, who appeared in behalf
of the Democratic County Committee of
Stanislaus.
The petition Bet forth that P. H. Griffin,
a qualified elector of Stanislaus, presented
to Dingley a certificate of nomination to
be filed, containing the names of all the
nominees of the Democratic County Con
vention of Stanislaus. Dingley refused to
accept the certificate for filing. The cer
tificate was first offered October 5, which
was last Monday. The day preceding was
a holiday, and the clerk refused the cer
tificate on Monday, because that was also
a legal holiday. Appended to the petition
was a copy of the reasons given by County
Clerk Dingley, which were as follows:
First â The same was presented to me on the
sth day of October, 18Â»6, by P. H. Griffin, and
1 refused to file the same that day because it
was a holiday and also because the same was
not presented within the time required by
law.
Secondâ Said certificate of nomination was
also presented to me for filing on the 6th day
of October, 1896, by P. H. Griffin, and I re
fused to file the same because it was not pre
sented to me for filing within the time re
â¢quired by law.
P. H. Griffin is the chairman of the
Democratic County Committee of Stanis
laus. The nominees who are concerned
in the decision of the court are the Demo
cratic candidate for Superior Judge and
the Democratic candidates for members
of the Board of Supervisors.
Judge Heweil argued for tho petition
that, as it was not possible to Ipgally file
the certificate on Sunday or Monday, it
must therefore be accepted and filed on
the day next succeeding, which was Tues
day, as it was offered in good faith on
Monday. The constitution provides that
the certificate must be filed not less than
thirty nor more than fifty days preceding
the election. If the certificate had been
accepted on Monday. Judge Hewell con
tended, the time limit would have been
satisfied.
Mr. Richards took a totally different
view of the matter. It was contemplated
legally, he said, to set apart thirty full
days before and exclusive of the day of
election, and he found the language "day
of election" to be significant. A day be
gins, he claimed and fortified his position
with decisions on that point, immediately
after midnight. The purpose of the thirty
day provision is to make sure that there
will be thirty days' notice. If the con
struction of counsel en the other side
should be accepted, then the time of filing
would be only twenty-eight days before
the day of the election. Such a ruling
would destroy and do away with the
thirty-day provision completely.
The wording "not less than thirty days
before the day of election" entirely pre
cludes the day upon which the election
occurs from the consideration. If the
certificate had been accepted when it was
ottered, the men who were left off the
ticket, and he presumed that there were
such, would have only eight days to get
their names on through petition, whereas,
the Legislature contemplated that they
should have ten d&ys in whicti to have
their names placed on record. One pur
pose of the Legislature was to fix a mini
mum, and this minimum was thirty days;
there is no question as to that.
All the Justices of the court were pres
ent with the exception of Justice Hen
shaw. They asked many questions during
the hearing, which took place in cham
bers. After this tbe matter was taken
under advisement. If the petition for the
writ is denied the candidates can yet get
their names on the ticket by petition.

Wounded by S. Nathan.
8. Nathan, a jeweler on Clay street, was

"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington j

Tne reason .that one can drop pins into
a tumbler brimful of water until the water
stands much higher, than the edge of the
glass is that the "lass, when i ; dry, has the
property of repulsing water in such a high
degree as to keep it back from the edge of
the tumbler until it. rises so high that the
downward pressure becomes sufficient to
overcome the ' repulsion > of 'â¢"> the w glass.

PLEAS ANTON'S WARM WELCOME
The Deleeat-s Are Hospl'ably Enter
tainedâCenterville for the
Next Council. '
PLEASASTON. Cal.. Oct. 7.â The sec
ond day's session found the delegates up
bright and early and the council of the
Portuguese Union was called to order an
hour sooner than expected. Last evening
Hahn & Tillman of the Rose Hotel pre
pared a "card party" and the delegates
enjoyed themselves until a late hour.
Tliis was the eventful day for many of
the delegates, as the nomination and elec
tion of new officers took place and to
night the annual banquet was given at
tie Rose Hotel. Hahn & Tillman, the
caterers, had prepared an excellent menu
and the affair eclipsed all former efforts of
these well-known hosts.
The first business this morning was the
reading of the following resolution, which
was received with tremendous applause:
Be itresolred by the Board of Trustee* of the
town of Pleasanton, in regular session, that
es the Grand Lodge of the Portuguese Union
of California is now in session In this town the
liberties of the town are hereby extended-, to
the said body by this board. T ha', the ordi
nance of this town relating to the closing of
place* of busitieÂ«B in the night is hereby sus
pended and the Town Marshal is hi- re au
thorized 10 allow all pine . B of business to re
main op .-mi, at the discretion of the owners,
daring the session of Â«â < i grand body.
William Napier,
President Board of Trustees.
J J. H. Xeal, Town Clerk.
Centerville, Mendocino Halfmoon Bay
and Fresno are after the next Grand
Council, but from present indications the
former will capture the hrnor of enter
taining the delegates next year. The
order of business has been ably bandied
by John Mattos. grand president, and tbe
council will finish i;s business by to
morrow as calculated.
After the reading of minutes this morn
ing tbe nomination and election of officer*
was made a special order. Frank Lemos
was placed in nomination by J. B. Rosa
and seconded by A. Aniaral. F. J. Cunha
was also paced in nomination, but as pre
dicted in this morning's Call Frank
Lemos carried off tlse honor by a v- te of
36 to 25. i'or ihe office of grand vice-presi
dent A. F. Cunha and A. A. Sarmento
contested for the honor, and Cunha carried
away the prize by a vote of 32 to 29. Louis
Martin was elected to succeed himself as
grand secretary, A*. Jjucio was apain
elected grand treasurer arid A. If, Martin
master of ceremonies by acclamation.
Fot grand marshal J. P. Rosa, Joseph
Bernardo and J. Nevis were nominated,
but the two former withdrew and Mr.
Nevis, who is a member of the local com
mittee of arrangements and who has done
so much for the entertainment of the del
egates during their stay in Pieasanton,
was given fie office by acclamation.
For grand guard F. C. Lima of Sacra
mento was given the honor without con
test.
For grand medical examiner there was
a lively contest, the contestants being Drs.
Bettencourt, Dean and Cabral. The three
physicians are all well known and popu
lar, and it merely came to a test of which
one of the three had the mo-t friends in
the council. Dr. Cabral carried off the
honors and was loudly cheered ana called
on for a speech. He responded by thank
ing the council for the honor conferred
and assured the Grand Council that he
would endeavor to fulfill the duties apper
taining to the office to the best of his
abi<ity.
For grand directors there were seven
candidates in the field, with rive to be
elected. The successful candidates ar*:
John Mattos Jr., No. 5; S. Diavila, No. 8;
J. C. Rodrigues, No. 8; Jo6ei h Pimintel,
No. 3; A. Fonte, No. 1.
Frank Lemos, the grand president of the
organization, came to the United States
eight years ago from his birthplace,
Azores Islands. He attended college in
iÂ» is native home and graduated with high
honors. His intention when he arrived in
America was to study for the priesthood
in one of the Eastern colleges, but he
soon changed his mind, and arriving in
California tin entered the law offic â¢ of G.
S. Langan nt Haywards. Although at
that time he could not speaK a word of
the English language, he became an apt
student and soon mastered his ambition,
and last year he ra sed a successful ex
amination before the Superior and Su
preme courts and oecame a full-fledged
attorney. Mr. Langan took him in as
partner, and now the law firm of Langan
& Lemos enjoy a lucrative practice.
Mr. Lemos will make a model presiding
officer, and during his administration it is
predicted the organization will have a
rapid growth.
A. F. Cunha, the grand vice-president
elect, is a native of the Azores Islands and
came to California thirty years ago, and
for the past fifteen years has beon a most
prominent citizen of Milpitas, where he
has been postmaster and merchant. Mr.
Cunha is a* young man in appearance and
tbe happy father of nine children, a ma
jority of whom some day he expects to
make members of the Portu uese Union.
The committee on jurisprudence made
an interesting report to the council this
afternoon. At the time that Council No.
1 of San Leandro was organized they
bought a lot in that town for $2000 and
erected a building on s-aid lot costing
$8000. The building and lot were in the
name of tne U. P. E. C, and Council No.
1 asked the Supreme Council for a deed to
same. Same was granted on favorable re
port of committee.
The by-laws "f Council No. 15 of San
Francisco and No. 11 of Sacramento were
reported on favorably by tbe committee
on laws and supervision, as they do not
conflict with the constitution of the Su
preme Council.
The committee appointed to send a
letter of thanks to tbe president of the
board of trustees of tbe town of Pieasan
ton. for the courtesy in extending tbe
freedom of the town, reported they had
complied with the request of the council.
The council then adjourned until 7 p. m.
At the evening session proposed amend
ments to the constitution were taken up
and no definite action was taken on any.
The event of the evening was ibe banquet
at Rose Hotel. It was a splendid affair
and great credit is due the committee oi
arrangementsâ J. P. Rosa, S. Diavila, Joe
Nevis, F. Caetano and J. V. Perelra.

He Secures the Position After a Long
and Stubborn Political
Fight
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 7.â 01 aC. Vin
cent was to-day appointed Postmaster of
Berkeley by President Cleveland to suc
ceed the present official, John Mi-Carthy.
This comes as something of a surprise
to most Berkeleyans, as it was generally
believed that Deputy Marshal Kerns was
in direct line for the position.
. Vincent Â«*ill assume his duties as soon
as the proper preliminaries in the way or

sioner Fitzgerald as special agent ever
since tbe establishment of tbe commis
sion. He was formerly employed by Wil
liam J. Dingee of Oakland in the real es
tate business and is a member of one of
the oldest and at one time one of the
wealthiest families in Oakland. For the
past year Vincent has been living on Tele
graph avenue near Dwight way. Berkeley.
His appointment marks the culmina
tion of a long fierce struggle between half
a dozen or more aspirants for the position.
The fight began last April when Post
munter McCarthy's term of office expired.
It was confidently expected that he would
be promptly deposed, having been ap
pointed under a Republican administra
tion, and as a consequence candidates for
his position rose up on all sides.
Seven men entered the race at the out
set, but only three stayed with it until the
end. These three men were Dan Land
regan, Deputy Marshal Kerns and Ole
Vincent.
Congressman English was said to have
had almost complete if not the entire,
control of the appointment. Various ap
peals were made through him, but the
would-be postmasters were not satisfied
with working through this channel alone,
so they be .-an a series of appeals and peti
tions to Washington. Tne^e only caused
the appointment to be delayed still longer.
A close watch has been kept on the
President's postofilce appointments by the
people of Berkeley for the past six months,
but nothing of a definite character was
heard until to-day.
Since the appointment of John McCar
thy in 1892 the growth of the postal busi
ness in Berkeley has been remarkable. A
free-delivery system has been inaugu
rated, a substation at Dwight way has
been set up, a stamp agency at North
Berkeley has been established, the office
has been transformed from one of the
third clasi to that of the second and a
special building has been set aside for its
use.
Their New Bell.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 7.â The Peralta
Fire Company at its meeting last evening
perfected arrangements for the building of
a tower to accommodate the new alarm
bell, which is expected to arrive next
week.
It was decided to give a social some time
next week to celebrate tbe hanging of the
bell. H. L. Tisdale, Walter Brothers and
Fred Fowler were appointed as a commit
tee to take charge of the entertainment.

DEATH OF A FIASCO,

Ideas.
Patents Have Expir d and the Com

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 7. I
The day has passed when the influential
Bitrgion Compound Rail Company should
have held its annual meeting and no no
tice has been sent out to the stockholders.
Nor will any ba sent, for the.company, in
which every prominent merchant and
capitalist in this county expected to make
huge fortunes, has passed out of exist
ence.
With its death die the hopes of all who
once tumbled over each other in their ef
forts to subscribe for slock.
The Bargion company was organized in
1890, L. W. Kennedy and Peter Bargion,
the inventor, being the principal backers.
Bar^ion agreed to put in his patents and
Kennedy was to promote the scheme.
Tne company was organized with 100,000
shares, at $10 a share par vaiue. Kennedy
and Bargion were to keep 25,000 shares
each end the remaining 50,000 shares were
to be disposed of, 50 cents to be paid on
each share of stock originally subscribed.
The scneme met with the approval and
backing of solid men. Luiher Fillmore
headed the list, then came A. D. Wilder,
J. C. Martin, J. T. Crothers and S. T. Gage,
all of the Southern Pacific Company. A.
T. Hatch, A. A. Moore, F. K. Shattuck,
W. S. Palmer, Timothy Guy Phelps, J. W.
Shanklin, A. D. Starr.V. D. Moody and men
of equal weight alo tock stock in the con
cern and certainly no scheme ever started
with fairer prospects than the Bargion
Kail Company.
When the time came to attempt to have
the rails made according to patents, there
was a big disappointment. L. W. Ken
nedy was sent Eusi to induce some com
pany to manufacture the new rail, and a
5-cent assessment was levied to ray the
expense. Kennedy secured an offer, but
the company refused to accept it.
Then J. E. Morriss was sent East to try
and do better than Mr. Kennedy. He
found that Bargion had made an attempt
Borne years before to pla^e the rail on the
market, and that the effort had failed be
cause of the great expense that its manu
facture would entail. He learned that tne
patents had only six years to ran from the
date of tbe incorporation of the company,
and Eastern companies would not take
hold of it because of tbe short life of the
patents.
'â¢The patents have all expired," said
Secretary J. E. Morriss to-day, "and the
company has gone out of ex si en cc. There
has been no annual meeting called be
cause there was no business to transact.
We own nothing, and so there was no
need of calling the stockhol lers together. "
Much money has been lost in the ven
ture and some has been made. Those
who paid money for their stock will lose
all ttiey paid. Kennedy and Bargion dis
posed of good blocks of their stock and
did not lose anything. When the com
pany was organized very few of the stock
holders knew how short was tbe life of
the patents, or that they had been offered
and rejected in tne East before.
MINISTERS AND POOLS,
The Union Has the Racetrack
Ordinanc? Under Considera
tion and Will Report.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 7. f
When the Ministerial Association holds
its next meeting the committee appointed
to report on the pool-selling ordinance
will have more interesting things to say.
The ordinance passed a few weeks ago
permitting the selling of pools within
racetrack inclosures only is the measure
under consideration by the ministers. The
ordinance was read twice at the same
meeting of the Supervisors under the sus
pension of the rules and passed to print.
It forbids the opening of poolrooms or
betting- places anywhere in the county ex
cept at the racetrack, and imposes a li
cense'of $50 per quarter on the proprietor
of a track.
It is given out that an attempt will be
made to get the Supervisors to rescind
the ordinance and to prohibit entirely the
selling of pools in any public place. In
less than, a month three Supervisors will
be elected and these constitute a working
majority of the board, which has but live
members. An endeavor will be made to
secure from the candidates a pledge to
pass an ordinance prohibiting all pool
Belling in tbe county.
Should the ministers carry out this idea
and receive the support of the Christian
Endeavorers it will greatly complicate the
situation ot the Supervisorial candidates.
Two of the Republican candidates, John
Mitchell and J. C. Jarvis, are members of
the Christian Endeavor body, but no
candidates have a* yet annouueed them
selves on the question that is now under
consideration by the Ministerial Union.
The committee wili report next Monday.
There are now more than 50,000 miles of
ocean cable.

The second day's Bession of the Central
Baptist Association was devoted to routine
work, but much of interest toot place.
The day was begun with a Bible study
at 9:15 led by the Rev. J. C. Baker, and
was followed with an address on "Good
Literature," by tne Rev. H. L. Dietz. He
advocated the reading of the Bible, re
ligious papers, biographies and historical
works in preference to the present day
trash as he talle I it. t
The Rev. J. M. Bushnell and Rev. D.
E. Unungs of the English Lutheran
Church being present were introduced 10
the association. The latter Is a mission
ary and by request he told of his work
among the Hindoo missions.
The Rev. George E. Duncan discussed
"Temperance and the Sabbath," and
charged that Christian people, as a rule,
did not give the temperance subject the
importance ii deserved.
The Rev. B. F. Hudleson said the
liquor-dealers of the State were preparing
to make an effort at the next session of
the Legislature to do away with all laws
detrimental to their traffic, and the tem
perance men*and Christians should strive
to counteract any such efforts.
Rev. Lawrence said it' was not so much
a lack of sentiment as it was a division as
to methods, while the enemy presented a
united front. '
The ieport on the work among the Chi
nese was made by the Rev. W. H. Latou
rette. He told of the work and said it was
very encouraging. As to the held in
which work was to be done he said every
eighteenth man in the State was a Chi
nese. Two-thirds of the Chinese on the
Pacific Coast were in Central and North
ern California. There are in San Fran
cisco about 20,000 Chinese, of which 1700
are children.
Dr. Alda Thompson qf San Francisco,
who has been connected wit'i the Chinese
work for a number of years, told oi the
many difficulties which had to be con
tended against and how one of her mission
scholars had asked if a part of heaven was
to be fenced off for them in the world to
come. She urged all Christians to show
a more brotherly feeling to the converted
Chinese.
The Baptist church, Reno, Nev., was
dismissed from the association at its own
request, so that it may become a member
of the Pacific Baptist Association.
The new church at Waterford, Stanis
laus County, was admitted into the asso
ciation.
The committee on place and preachers
reported in favor of holding the next ses
sion of the association with the Emman
uel Church, San Francisco, and the Rev.
G. \V. Swift was selected to preach the an
nual sermon, with the Rev. M. P. boyn
ton as alternate. They reoommended that
tne Rev. C. H. Hobart preach the doc
trinal sermon, with J. F. Moody as alter
nate. The report was adopted.
The committee on digest of letters re
ported churches in fairly good condition,
but no special services. Mission work un
der a number of churches flourishing.
Times* generally reported hard, but finan
cial condition of most of the churches
good. The total membership of the twen
ty churches is 3244, and the average at
tendance of their Sunday-school is 2447.
One of the most interesting characters
in attendance is Deacon E. It. Stockwell
of Stockton. He is past 81a.id isas active
as many much younger. He was ordained
as deacon in 1858 and has been a delegate
to every annual session of the association
since 1856, this making his fortieth con
secutive meeting. He has a married grand
daughter residing here who has two lovely
children, of whom he is very fond.
The evening session was devoted to a
"victory" meeting. There were addresses
by Rev. 8. V. Keetchon "Victory Through
the vVord," President T. G. Brownson on
"V ctorv Through Prayer" and the Rev.

FOUGHT IN THE STREET
Editor Marshall and City Veter
inary Carpenter Come
to Blows.
Henry Bow r Leaves Alameda to Get
a Few Days' SleepâSchu
machers' Divorce.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 7.â A personal
encounter between Editor E. L. Marshall
of the Tele ram und City Veterinary Dr.
Thomas Carpenter, attracted considerable
attention on Park street this afternoon.
Twelve or more heavy blows were struck
by the participants before Police Officer
Welch interfered.
Four months ago an article appeared in
the Telegram reflecting on Carpenter,
which the doctor resented. He'toid Mar
shall what he thoughtof him, but no blows
were struck. Last week Marshall began
printing articles reflecting upon the doc
tor's medical qualifications in a joking
way. To-day they met, and trouble en
sued. The encounter, as seen by P. E.
Vandour, is related thus:
"As they neared one another Dr. Car
penter stared Marshall in the face and
hissed, 'Dirty cur.' Marshall struck out
quickly with bis right hand, catching
Carpenter on tbe left jaw, near the ear.
Carpenter had both hands bandagt-d as a
result of a recent bicycle tumble. He
used them to good advantage, and after
two or more blows each Marshall either
fell or slipped. While he was partially
down Carpenter hammered him in tbe
face four or five terrific blows. Marshall
then got up and again attacked Carpenter.
Officer Welch separated them and Marshall
went home.
"Dr. Carpenter was no match for Mar
shall in such r condition, but I think
honors are even. He punished Marshall
enough when he was down to make up for
what he received himself. Marshall's lip
was bleeding and his eye blackened."
Carpenter was on the street shortly after
the affair, and laughingly offered to put
up $20 for another bout. To-night Mr.
Marshall said : "All I want to say is that I
considered that 1 was insulted and re
sented it, as any man should. That is all
there is to it."
Officer Welch swore to a complaint late
to-night and bad both Carpenter and
Marshal arrested. They were released
upon giving ball.

Mr. and Mrs. White. The iatter were in
San Francisco at the time aud sha had
retired for the night.
About 11 o'clock she heard the dogs
barking, and a little later heard a window
open. A man entered her room and
struck a match, but she kept her eyes
shut. Tbe man then went to tbe kitchen
door, unlocked and opened it and re
turned to her bed. He took her by the
wrists, when she began to scream. He
placed a gag in her mouth, but she fought
fiercely until she tot it out. She then be
gan to scream. She got to a window and,
throwing it up, jumped out and ran down
the street crying lor help.
When help arrived the burglar had
escaped without taking anything. Mr.
and Mrs. White returned home half an
hour later. Elia's throat shows bruises
and scratches where she was choked.

COYNE'S STRANGE FIND,
His Canary Shaughraun Was
Embalmed lor Twenty-
Five Years.
The Metal Resting Place of the Bird
Turns Up After a Lapse of
Generations.
Tbe strangest find of its kind on record
was made Tuesday by John Coyne, a
tinsmith who has Kept a shop on lower
Clay street for the past thirty years.
Coyne is somewhat of a character in bis
i ay, and his snug lit t c shop is well
known for the many curios that' he keeps
there in the way of animals, birds, and,
above all, strange and beautiful shells
t at he imports from all parts of the
world.
Twenty-five years ago Coyne had a
beautiful little canary that he called
Shaughraun and of which he was ex
traordinarily fond.
A sorrowful day came, however, when
Snaugbraun went the way of all canaries
and Coyne was disconsolate.
The bird had been so much ot a com
panion to him and had found so much of
a place in his heart that he decideu not to
bury it, but to preserve the body.
All of his ingenuity as a metal worker
was brought into play and within a day
Shaug. raun's body was inclosed in a tiny
metal case, handsomely ornamented with
tbe name of the deceased songster and
hermetically sealed. Before closing the
box the birri's body was treated with an
embalming preparation and wrapped in
woolen cloths.
As time wore on the bird's memory
grew les- green in Covne'a mind, and he
finally lost sight of tne box.
Yesterday, when after the lapse of â¢
quarter of a century he was looking over
a lot of curios that had been stored away,
he came across a little metal box covered
with rust and dust but still familiar to his
eye. On one side, almost obliterated by
the rust, was the word, ''Shaughraun,"
and Coyne had found his pet once more.
Tears came into the old man? eyes as
he remembered the days when the It le
songster piped blithly on his tin. ers and he
cleaned up the box with the intention of
giving it an honored place among his
treasures.
Curiosity, however, finally prompted
him to open the box, and after the cloths
were removed, there lay the body oi little
Shaughraun, as yellow and periect as
when it was laid away. After showing the
bird to his friends, some of whom had
grown old and gray since it died, Coyne
resealed the box and will keep it as one of
his most valued possession*.
PASTOR WELCOMED.
Reception at Grace Methodist Episcopal
Church to the Rev. J. >'.
Beard.
There was nothing set and formal in last
night's reception accorded by Grace Meth
odist Episcopal Church to its new paster,
the Rev. J- N. Beard.
The church parlors were embowered in
fragrant blossoms. The exercises began
with the tegular midweek prayer-meeting.
The new pastor presided.
W. W. Wiester of the official board of
the church then took tbe stand and in a
few cordial words welcomed Mr. Beard to
his new field in the name of the church,
its members and all the societies con
nested with it.
Little Blanche Head made a nice address,
which the pastor himself had to applaud,
though it praised him, for it was delivered
in so winsome a fashion that its sincerity
could not be doubted. When she had con
cluded, the little lady offered the pastor a
buncli of fragrant roses.
Mr. Beard, in a short reply, thanked tbe
congregation most cordially for its greet
ing, and expressed the hope that his com
ing might prove of spiritual benefit to the
church and himself.
The church members then gathered
about their newspirltual gui le, and di.rng
the hour of pleasant converse which en
sued Mr. Beard was made to realize that
among his flock he would truly be ''at
home."

DIMOND OPENS UP
ON THE CHARTER
The Candidate for Mayor
Says the Mayor Would
Boss the City.
He Points Out That There Would
Be Three Thousand Appoint
ments at Stake.
AN APPEAL TO THE TEACHERS
Some of the Views of the Man Who
Will Head the Anti-Charter
Fight of the Campaign.
Supervisor Joseph I. Dimond, Demo
cratic and Populistic candidate for Mayor,
Is taking a very active part in organizing
the anti-charter campaign, which is about
to be opened by leading opponents of this
much-discussed instrument.
Mr. Dimond finds many faults in the
charter as it is submitted to tne people,
but gives two points especial importance â
the concentration of power in the hands
of the Mayor aud the debated one of the
effect of the charter on the public schools.
His views on these points are presented j
in the following communication, which is
of interest as exhibiting the attitude of
the leading opponents of the charter:
San Francisco, Oct. 5, 1896.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: My position j
in regard to the new cnarter appears to be mis- j
understood in some quarters, and I request !
permission to state through your columns my
views on a matter of great public interest and
importance.
I am not, and never have been, in favor of
the charter. I consider that instrument un
democratic, un-American and unworthy of
tne support of any citizen who has at heart I
the welfare of this community.
It is a conglomeration oi laws, rules and !
regulations crudely and hurriedly put to- I
gcther, which if adopted as the organic law of j
San Francisco will certainly work a vast
amount of mischief. I have not time here to
discuss, or even refer to, all of the defects ap
parent in the charter. I will, however, touch
upon a few.
In the first place the charter is undemo
cratic. Its framers were evidently imbued
with the notion that the people of this City are
not capable of self government, for it is sought
by this charter to deprive the people of the
power of electing their own servants. The
charter might be well adapted to the govern
ment of a Eussian or Chinese municipality,
where the common people enjoy few privi
leges other than that of living, but it is cer
tainly ill suited to the wants of a great Ameri
can city.
The most serious objection to the charter is
the power vested by it in the Mayor. It
makes of him a veritable Czar.
If the charter is adopted the Mayor will ap
point:
1. Board of Education.
2. Police Commissioners.
3. Fire Commissioners.
4. Park Commissioners.
5. Board of Health.
6. Election Commissioner!.
7. Board of Public Works.
8. Civil Service Commissioners.
9. Library Trustees.
10. City Attorney.
11. Public Administrator.
And when the constitution and the laws
shall be changed he will appoint:
12. County Clerk.
13. Recorder. '
14. Tax Collector.
15. Coroner.
16. Justices of the Peace.
What does this great power mean? It means !
that the Mayor shall nominally, at least, con- i
trol the appointment directly or indirectly of â 
fully 3000 persons employed in the different â 
departments of our municipal Government.
With the Fire Department, Police Depart
ment, School Department, Park Commis-
Blotters, Street Department, County Clerk's ;
office, Tax Collector's office and Recorder's !
office acting together Iv politics, as they cer- i
tainly would when controlled by one man (the !
Mayor), nothing could withstand their in- i
fluence in primary politics as well as at i
general elections; xheir combined power |
would be invincible. If an absolutely perfect \
man would always be elected Mayor no uanger i
need be apprehended, but in no man can per- |
'ection be fouud. It is better for us on account j
of the imperfections and frailties of men to I
divide authority as much ac possible among |
the people and give no man ihe vast power
which the charier contemplates shall be exer- i
cised by the Mayor.
A greater danger yet to /ear is the danger
tbftt the Mayor may be the tool of a bos*. My
nomination whs "conferred on me by the
Democratic and People's party conventions !
without solicitation on my part and without
pledge or promise of any kind from me or on J
my behalf. Tarn satisfied that ihe other gen-]
tlemen nominated for the oflÃce of Mayor, all :
of whom I know to be men of pure character
a:;d strict integrity, are unpledged. I know
that each is too honorable to barter away the
patronÃgeof the office to which he aspires. |
But the charter is not yet adopted. If the i
new charter becomes the organic law of this
municipality pledged candidates will be the
rule and not the exception.
I have said more than I intended saying, j
but not one-tenth as much as might be said j
upon this subject alone. I will now refer to I
that portion oi the charter which relates to i
the powers of the Board of Education. The char- |
ter provides that the School Department shall i
be under the control and management of a
Board of Education composed of five school
directors, to be appointed by the Mayor.
Under the charter the board has power "to
employ, pay and dismiss such teachers and
persons as may be necessary to carry into effect
its powers and duties. * * * But no teacher
shall be dismissed except for sufficient cause,
which shall be determined by said board after
giving the accused teacher due hearing in his j
or her defense.
Under the present law a teacher once elected
"shall be dismissed only for violation of the
rules of the Board of Education or for incom
peteocy, unprofessional or immoral conduct."
On two occasions at least the Board of Educa
tion of this City, through favoritism or.
prejndice, has attempted to dismiss competent
teachers from the department without any
proof of violation of the rules of the board, or
without proof of unprofessional or immoral
conduct, and in each case the Supreme Court
of this Slate has compelled the board to re- |
instate the teacher. I refer to the case of the I
late Kate Kennedy against the Board of Edu
cation and the case of Miss Fairchild against
the seme board.
Under the charter, if adopted, three mem
bers of the Board of Directors, acting in con
cert, may dismiss for any cause which they
may determine to bo sufficient any teacher,
however capable. The charter places each
and every teacher in the public schools of this
City at the mercy of three School Directors, or
perhaps the Mayor who appoints them, or the !
political boss by whose grace tbe Mayor fills j
his office. Any schoolteacher who raises his or
her voice or whose influence is exerted in ad
vocacy of the charier displays a woeiul lack
of interest in the welfare ot the department
and a wonderful disregard of his or her own
interest. Under the charter the Board of Edu
cation at its first meeting may dismiss every
teacher in the department. Suppose the board
thus arbitrarily nets. It of course may ap
point teachers to fill the vacancies. The board
may every year dismiss the teachers. What
worry and anguish may not the teacher suffer
realizing as he or she must that his or her posi
tion at all times is held subject to the whim,
caprice or prejudice of a majority of a board
composed of five, or that at the dictation of a
boss intent upon rewarding a favorite the
teacher is liable at any time to be cast adrift
in the world with a profession, but without the
right to practice it.
There Is another clause, however, to which I
object, and to which every liberal-minded
American ought to obiect. That clause is
alone sufficient to damn the entire charter.
I refer to "-Ã¼bdivision 4of section 1, chapter
111, article 7of the charter. That clause reads
as follows:
4. The Board of Education shall not appoint any
person to be a teacher In the primary or grammar
classes of the schools of this City and County ex
ceot upon competitive examination of those
persons hol'iitirj teacher's certificated, and who
rtave been educated in the public school system of
tbe State ot California.
That clause was intended to exclude from
the right to teach in our public Kcbools men
and women who have been educated in pri
vate educational institutions. It is a direct
flap in the face of a large body of our citizens
who represent half the population, half the
votes and a fair proportion of the wealth, in
telligence and enterprise of this community.
\Yhv should such a narrow-minded policy
be engrafted into the organic law of any
American municipality? Why should we rec
ognize anything but worth, capacity and
morals in the ' Selection of our teachers? Un
der this objectionable provision a graduate of
Oxford, Cambridge, Hnrvard, Yale, or of the
Stanford University would be ineligible to ap
pointment as tench* in our public schools. I
have heard it said by certain advocates of the
charter, one of whom is now seeking public
office, ihat under this clause nn applicant will
not be oblieed to paÂ«s through the public
schools, that he or she may after leuving a pri
vate school enter the formal School, there
study for one year and ' thereupon shall be
eligible to appointment as teacher. Such a
construction is absurd. The very letter find
spirit of that provision require that the appli
cant for a teacher's position shall be "brought
up" or "reared" or "trained" in the public
schools of the State. The constitution of the
State defines the public school system. We
find the definition in section 6" of article IX of
the constitution as follows:
"The public school system shall include
primary mid grammar schools and such hign
schools, evening schools, normal schools and
technical schools as may be established by th*
Legislature or by municipal or district author
ity."
The charter means that a teacher must have
received his or her education or training in
the school system as defined by the constitu
tion.
Suppose a girl spends the first year or two of
her school days in one of the primary grades
of our public schools. Suppose she spends the
remainder of her school days in a private
school ; can it be said that she has been edu
cated (brought up or reared) in the public
school system of this State? Certainly ntÂ»t.
Suppose the child instead of spending tbe
first year of her school days in the primary
grade spends the last year only of her schooi
life in the Normal School, can it be said that
she has been educated, brought up or reared
in the public school system of the State ? Cer
tainly not. The cases are parallel. The char
ter, if adopted, must receivo a construction in
accordance with its spirit. Any court to whom
the validity of this clause will be submitted
would hold, and reasonably so, that persons
educated or brought up In private schools
must be excluded from positions as teachers
in our public schools. I sincersly hope that
no court will ever have an opportunity to pass
upon the question, and that the charter will
never pass beyond the tribunal of the people.
The promises made to the teachers ny the
framers and advocates of the new charter to
secure amendments to the same by bringing
about a repeal of all objectionable provisions
relating to the School Department are too
silly to notice. The teachers are not fools to
be "taken in by promises which the promisers
have not the power to keep.
The opinion of the attorneys employed by
the charter makers that the provisions relating
to the public schools are unconstitutional and
void is entitled to no respect whatever, iv
the Freeholders' convention were two able
lawyers, one of whom is denouncing his wor_
as unconstitutional. How does any person,
layman or lawyer, know that the Supreme
Court will decide the school law in the charter
to be unconstitutional? None but the Oranis
cientoan forotell how the Supreme Court will
decide any question. Let the teachers take no
chances, fiut exert their influence in every
possible direction to kill an instrument which
strikes a deadly blow at their crafi. Let every
true American ignore ti;e mouthinÃS and
literature of sham reformers, who proclaim the
charter to be a godsend, and let honest citi
zens on election day damn beyond hope of re
demption the iniquitous charter. Very truly
yours, Joseph I. Dimond.
NOT WHAT THEY SEEMED,
A Sailor and a Woman Mas
querading in Each Other's
Attire.
They Were Arrested and Released
on Their Own Reccgn zance by
Judge Campbell.
People wbo happened to be in the neigh
bortifcod of Powell and Eddy streets about
4 o'clock Monday morning had ttieir at
tention attracted by the peculiar appear
ance of a man and a woman. The man
was dressed in the garb of a sailor in
Uncle Sam's navy and looked extremely
th n about the shoulders and waist. The
woman looked like a giantess.
They Had both been drinking, and the
sailor had a perceptible "jag" on. PoJice
men Ring and McCottery saw the couple
and as they passed under a lamppost
something in the rollicking gait of the
woman aroused their susDicions and they
accosted tbe pair.
Neither the sailor nor the woman would
at tirst answer any questions, but when
they at last spoke they could not disguise
their voices and they Dad to contess that
they were not what they seemed. The
sailor was a woman ana the supposed
woman was a sailor belonging to tne Mon
terey. He gave his name as Leon Felker
and tbe woman as Bessie Price.
They were taken in the patrol wagon to
the City Prison and charged with mas
querading in attire that did not belong to
tnem. Felker is a biÂ£, strapping young
fellow, and his appearance was extremely
ludicrous. He wore his blue flannel un
derclothing and over it a long light ul3ter
belonging to tbe woman. He had on her
hat, a light straw sailor, and his face was
covered with her veil. Bessie looked en
trancing in the sailor suit, auhougn it was
several hizes too large for her.
She was so unstrung at being arrested
that she fainted in the prison. Felker
said he had known her in Vailejo and she
came here to have a good time with him.
Just for fun they thought they would ex
change clothes, and they never thought
they would be arrested.
Judge Campbell visited the prison
Monday morning and released them on
their own recognizance. Feiker had
meantime donned his own suit and he
went to Bessie's room and brought her
dress, so that she could leave tbe prison
decently slad.
Felker and Bessie appeared before Judge
Campbell yesterday morning. They both
expressed contrition for their foolishness
and tne Judge was lenient. He sentenced
Felker 10 pay a tine of $5, with no alter
native, and Bessie was released on her
own recognizance for ten days, as she said
she would return to Vallejo.

Williams Still Without Bail
Attorney Madden, who, in the absence of
George D. Collins, is the legal adviser of Dick
Williams, failed Again yesterday in his at
tempt to secure bail for his client. There was
plenty of property offered, but it was not of
the kind desired by Clerk Hoffman. It ap
pears that a well-known real-estate man on
Montgomery street was willing to place at Mr.
Hoffman's disposal twelve 25-foot lots in the
Ailendale tract, near Oakland, but it devel
oped that a heavy mortgage rests on the prop
erty. Another geutiem'an, who seemed anxious
to become a bondsman, offered as security 125
acres of El Dorado County timber land. He
was informed that the Government was anx
ious to dispose of several hundred thousand
acres of the same kind of land at the nominal
figure of $1 25 p^r acre. Mr. Madden is not at
all discouraged over these repeated failures,
but says that he will surely find acceptable
bondsmen to-day.
Turned On the Gas.
Richard Pringie, a marine fireman, was
found dead in his room, 642 Folsom street,
yesterday morning. The gas was turned on in
full iorce, though this is thought to have been
the result of accident. Pringie had been
drinking heavily for several days and Thurs
day night was very much intoxicated. It is
believed that he turned the gas off and then,
in his drunken stupor, turned it on again.
The body was removed to tne Morgue.

DIMOND WILL
NOT WITHDRAW
The Democratic - Populist
Candidate for Mayor
Speaks Right Out.
James D. Phelan, His Rival,
Wanted to Arrange for
a "Meeting."
A ONE-SIDED PBOPOSITION.
The Raineyite Desired Joseph to Retire
in the Interest of Democratic
Harmony.
Joseph I. Dimond, the Democratic and
Populist candidate for Mayor, will not
retire from the fight for that high office in
favor of James D. Pheian, the nominee of
the Raineytes and Non-Partisans.
He stated so last night in a most em
phatic manner, and expressed his surprise
that the rumor that he would had been
circulated.
"No, sir-ec, I will not retire," said he.
"Why should I. To please Mr. Phelan?
Maybe he would like to have me leave
him a clear field. In fact he has shown
plainly that that is his wish. How
do I know he wishes it? Well, it
came about in this way. Several mu
tual friends of Mr. Phelan and mine
not politicians, but business men â
came to me at least a month ago and
asked me if 1 would consent to meet Mr.
Phelan. Great Scot! I've known Jimmy
Phelan for twenty odd years, and the idea
of mutual friends trying to arrange a
meeting between us upon Mr. Pheian's
request rather amused me. I asked them
what JUr. Phelan wanted and why he did
not telephone that he wanted to meet me
instead of going about it with so much
red tape as thouerh we were a couple of
European potentates. My friends did not
know what Phelan wanted, only that he
wanted them to arrange for a meeting.
11 -Teli Mr. Phelan that I will meet him.
Have him ring up on the telephone and I
guess we will settle the business in two
minutes,' was what 1 told the gentlemen.
"Well, I did not hear anything from
Mr. fhelan except through gentlemen
whom ne sent asking for a meeting, and I
always answered that Mr. Phelan and I
could fix up a meeting at any time.
'However, there was a meeting with
Mr. Phelan of wnich I knew nothing until
it was all over. He and several of my
friends met and Mr. Pnelan stated to
them that he and I should do all in our
power to fix up matters in the interests of
harmony in the party. My friends agreed
that his remarks were logical and they
asked him to state what he wanted and
how harmony could be effected.
"Mr. Phelan did not go to the point
directly, out said that the Democratic
party should be un ited, so as to present a
solid front to the common enemy. Again,
my friends agreed with him, but as he
would not suggest a way by which this
state of affairs could be reached, my
friends took the bull by the horns and
made this proposition. It was this: That
I would retire, with their consent, as can
didate of the two parties I now stand for,
if Mr. Phelan would retire, with its con
sent, as candidate of the one party he
represents, and that the three parties
would come together and select another
candidate for Mayor who would be accept
able to the three.
" 'But I represent two parties,' said Mr.
Phelan. "You forget that I stand for the
Non-Partisans also.'
â¢'My friends told him that they were
not trying to arrange for harmony in the
Non-Partisan ranks. They were only
working for harmony in tbe Democratic
party. Mr. Phelan declined to accept the
offer, and my lriends told him that if his
only proposition in the interest of party
harmony was that I should retire and
give him a clear field they would not
agree to have me step down ; that if
he was so anxious for harmony in
tbe Democratic rants he should be
willing to make a concession, too, and
step down at the same time with me. Mr.
Phelan replied that he would not enter
tain the idea of retinue â no, not for a
second; not if he suffered defeat of the
worst kind.
"That ended the meeting. While under
the circumstances of its termination I
agreed wiih my friends in what they had
done and said I did feel that they had as
sumed much responsibility in making the
proposition they did, as Â« fact 1 did
not know that I would have felt bound to
have abided by their proposition, even if
Mr. Pheian had accepted it. because it was
wholly unauthorized by me.
"Tins matter of Mr. Phelan wanting to
arrange a meeting with me has puzzled
me considerably. I never knew Pnelan to
be given to dirty work, that is, low politi
cal tricks, and I don't beiieve he would,
but I have wondered if ac wanted me to
call at his office. If I bad gone there I
would have been asked my name and
business by some young office-boy who
would have then asked me to send in mv
card. After a while he might have re
turned and requested me to be seated, as
Mr. Phelan was bus}'. Probably I would
have sat in the outer office while poli
ticians would pass in and out and gaze at
me curiously.
"They would, without doubt, go out and
say that I was banging around Jimmy
Pheian's office trying to effect a compro
mise. No, siree, I don't do business that
way. If a man wants to meet me I'll see
him. If I want to meet anybody I'll go
about it in a straightforward manner and
without any red tape.
"If any one thinks tbat I am going to
retire, he is mistaken. I am in the lieht
to stay, and you can tell the public so with
all the force* of plain language. I'll make
SEW TO-DAY.

POPULIST CHANGES.
Two Resignations Accepted and Three
Vacancies Filied.
Three changes were made on the Popu
list ticket last night by tbe executive
committee. Two were due to resignations
and one was made to lill a vacancy for
which no nomination had be^n made.
Terrence O'Brien resigned as a candidate
for Supervisor from the Ninth Ward,
owing to lack of confidence in the success
of the Populist ticket H. B. Goecken was
selected to take bis place.
Dr. C. D. Cleveland resigned as a candi
date for Supervisor from the Eighth Ward,
and Frank Malloy, who is on the Buckley
ticket, was substituted. Dr. Cleveland in
tendering bis resignation stated that cir
cumstances had arisen which prevented
him from making a canvass, and for that
reason he felt it incumb.-nt on him to
withdraw.
Colonel John O'Byrne was selected as
the candidate for District Attorney. He,
too, is on the Buckley ticket.
It was decided to have a big meeting in
the Fourth Congressional District to
ratify the indorsement of Hon. James G.
Maguire for Congress from that district.
At this meetiner Congressman Maguire
will deliver an address from the point of
view of his Populist admirers. Tbe date
has not yet been fixed. The meeting will

L QUOR- DEALERS FOB DIMOND.
Pheian's Friends Spent Two Weeks in
a Futile Effort to Pall Dimond
Down.
A compact, well-organized and aggres
sive fight against the new charter is about
to be launched into the seething waters of
municipal politics, and it promises to be
one of the leading features and forces of
this interesting and complicated local
campaign.
This organized anti-charter fight is to
range itself about Supervisor Joseph I.
Dimond, who is to become the distinc
tively anti-charter candidate for Mayor.
Mr. Dimond is the Buckley and the Popu
list candidate foi Mayor, and the Bucku
listic local campaign will in a way include
in its goal the whole Buckley-Populist
ticket Chris Buckley is the master poli
tician who has planned the campaign.
Joe Dimond will personify the complex
nature of the Buckleyites' campaign, and
as much as possible of the political force
accumulated will be directed to the rear
of the rest of tue ticket to boost it along.
The great issue of the Buckulistic cam
paign will be the charter. The Buctcley
faction of the Democracy will fight the
charter tooth and toenail, and the Podu-
Jists, who have surrendered to Buckley,
will play the part of allies so far as the
leaders can direct the party's force.
Leading Buckleyites, leading personal
friends of Dimond and leading opponents
of the charter, who are ready to accept
D mond, have organized powerful support
and arranged a plan of campaign, the de
tails of which will appear in two or three
days.
There is to be first a big anti-charter
mass-meeting. At this mass-meeting
some resolutions will be passed providing
for a definite anti-cbarter or anization.
Whether or not an association of some
sort with a large membership is created
there will be an executive or campaign
committee, which will conduct an aggres
sive anti-charter campaign.
Anti-charter campaipn literature will be
freely distributed and it is understood
that at least two meetings per night will
be held.
All this will be ostensibly purely anti
charter, but it will all be in effect pro-
Dimond as well. Mr. Dimond will jump
into the middle of the tight and will ad
dress a mass-meeting somewhere just
about every night.
Patrick Reddy, ex-Judge J. F. Sullivan,
J. S. Reynolds and mauy other well
known citizens, who oppose tbe charter,
will take an active part in the fight from
rostrums, wagons and private consulta
tion rooms.
Mr. Dimond opens his anti-charter
campaign in a communication to The
Call, published elsewhere, in which he
expresses his views on two of the main
objections to the charter on which its op
ponents rely.
This issue, it is at once seen, divides the
local Democracy by a still wider breach.
"Jimmy" IMielan, the Junta and Exam
iner candidate, who is now on tbe street
generally remarked to be an apparent
third in tbe race, is an outspoken advo
cate of the new charter.
It is also currently understood among
the politically wise that Rainey has con
ceded to him his support on tbe basis ot
a proper understanding about the Fire
Department if the charter and Mr. Paelan
should both succeed.
Mr. Dimond opposes the charter and
Mr. Phelan advocates it. Mr. Dimond is
a silver man and Mr. Phelan is a gold bug.
Mr. Dimond has the Populist indorse
ment and Mr. Phelan has the indorsement
of the unorganized artists.
Mr. Dimond is backed by Chris Buckiey
et al. and Mr. Phelan is "backed by Sam
Rainey et al. The fight is bitter and un
compromising, and will end only in the
death that November 3 will bring.
Other forces beside the anti-charter
and the Populiat sentiments are being
massed behind Dimond and the Bucku
listic ticket. It is already well under
stood that Dimoncl and much of tbe rest
of the dual ticket he is on is to be sup
ported by the strong organization of
liquor-dealers which are allied this year
in the California Protective Association.
Thtre is a powerful lot of connubiating
eoing on in local Democratic politics, and
it has included a desperate but futile
effort on tbe part of J. D. Pbelan and
some of his friends to pull Dimond out. of
the fight.
All that has leaked out before this about
it was a vague rumor, half credited by
some, that Dimond would withdraw.
DimondN friends laugh at the idea.
According to tne slory, in the main con
firmed by Dimond himself, the political
friends of Phelan began nearly two weeks
ago their efforts to induce Dimond to
withdraw.
"Mr. Dimond was asked to call on Mr.
Phelan," said one of Dimond's friends
yesterday, "and Mr. Dimond replied that
be could be easily seen by his friend, Mr.
Phelan, if the latter would call.
All sorts of efforts and arguments were
made by Pbelan's friends and there was
always tbe argument among others of
party harmony.
"Last week Mr. Dimond made a plain
and a square proposition. He said he
would resign if Mr. PbeJan would, on the
understanding that the three conventions
â the two Democratic and the Populist â
should unite in the interest of harmony
and name a candidate.
"But Mr. Phelan really couldn't do that.
He was nominated by the Non-Partisans,
too, and ho on. Ail the Phelan people
asked was that Dimond should get out of
his way. But Mr. Dimond is in the race
to stay."
The Buckleyites are to have a big ratifi
cation meeting at Odd Fellows' Hall Sat
urday night, at which most of the candi
dates will make brief speeches.
SCHMELZER MYSTERY.
It Is Intensified by thÂ« Finding of a
Certificate of Deposit.
While walking along Montgomery,
avenue between Jackson and Washington
streets yesterday afternoon Policeman
Freel of tbe Chinatown squad picked up a
certificate of deposit witn the Bank of
California in the name of Q. F. Schmelzer,
made in April, 1895.
He took it to the bank and found that
it was a genuine certificate. How is got
there is a mystery. It was lying on tbe
sidewalk unfolded. Freel took it to the
property clerk, who will retain it pending
developments.
Schmelzer had a small shoestore at 114
Montgomery avenue. He was' arrested in
March 1.-ist for being d run it and a lew days

GRAND ARMY TRIBUTE.
Resolutions of George 11. Thomas Post
in Memory of tharles D. Wheat.
George H. Thomas Post, G. A. R., Com
mander A. J. Vining, held a regular meet
ing last night, Aside from the ordinary
business of the post, mention was made
of the death of Charles D. Wheat, a well
known citizen of San Francisco.
A resolution expressing the feeling of
the post was introduced and adopted.
The preamble Bets forth that Mr. Wheat
as Commissioner and notary never charged
a pension applicant for attesting papers.
The resolution holds that Mr. Wheat was
conspicuously a true and helpful friend of
widows and orphans of deceased Union
soldiers.
Charles D. Wheat was a brave officer in
the Confederate army. Shortly after the
close of the war he came to this City, and
gained many friends in California.
A MESS-BOY JILTED.
P. Boitrom Shoot-. Himself in the Head,
but Not Fatally.
P. Bostrom, a boy 19 years of age, living
with his parents at 626 Lombard street,
attempted to commit suicide last night by
shooting himself in the head.
He was in love with a pretty girl, the
daughter of a neighbor, but she jilted him
and he threatened to kill himself. Last
night his father and mother left the house
and locked the door of the boy's bedroom.
After they h<ui gone he broke open the
door, got his revolver and fired a ballet
into his skull. It entered below the right
ear, but Dr. Fitzgibbon does not think the
wound will prove fatal.
Young Bostroni is a mess-boy on the
steamer Walla Walla.
