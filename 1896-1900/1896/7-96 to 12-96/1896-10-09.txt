ON TO CANTON
Italian- Americans Lead the
Never â¢ Ending
Stream.
Major McKinley's Patriotic
Words Stir Up Great
Sentiment.
THE TORNADOES OF APPLAUSE.
Men of All Classes Determined to
Restore the Prosperity of
the Country.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. B.â With the re
turning sunshine came at noon to-day a
delegation of 300 r swarthy, dark-haired
' Italian- Americans with banners and bands
â  from Pittsburgh These. Italian-born citi
zens have learned to cheer, and they gave
Major McKinley a stirring welcome when
he appeared on the porch to address them.
The spokesman for the .Italian clubs was
' Lewis Beggino, and he made a speech
which was a model of brevity, and could
â  be imitated with profit by tne spokesmen
' of ail delegations which come here. Major
- McKinley expressed great satisfaction
with it. This is what Mr. Beggino said:
| V Major McKinley: I have been assigned the
â¢ pleasing task of Introducing to you this delega
tion of Italian-Americans, members of the
3 United Italian Republican Club of the city of
â¢ Pittsburg. These humble toilers are hereto
greet yon as the gallant standard-bearer of
the party which stands for the promotion of
the best interests of all who labor lor the daily
' bread and they yield to nobody in their devo
tion to the traditions and principles of that
glorious old party. :
Major McKinley then addressed the del
egation as follows:
My fellow-citizens: 1 am indeed very glad to
â¢ meet my fellow-citizens of Italian birth and
â¢ descent who r have honored me with : this visit
- to-day.- I ihanK you for having brought the
sunshine. [Laughter.] I appreciate ; this visit
I because it means that you have an interest in
. common with all your fellow-citizens in the
welfare of the country of your adoption- [A
' voice,"We have"], and because you feel that in
the campaign now upon us there is much
' involved In the rightful settlement of the ques
< tions which are presented. j We are a Nation
â¢ of working people. We recognize no caste or
. class or rank and will tolerate none beneath
_ this flag. We are a Nation of [political equals.
Tie' voice of one citizen "is* as potent as the
, voice of another, and their united voice, when
â  constitutionally expressed, .is the law of the
land. The great statistician, Mr. j Mulhall,
declares that no other civilized country could
boast of 41,000,000 instructed citizens In a
total population of 70,000,000, all of whom
happily are equally beneficiaries of the advan
â¢ ages and blessings and opportunities of free
.government.- 'i : . ttryi â  in: 'â  >
After briefly reviewing the issues of the
campaign the Major concluded as follows:
I am especially gratified to" be assured that
our Italian fellow-citizens are enrolled this
year in the ranks of the great .Republican
party . [Applause and cries of "Good"], and
that they are enlisted in a patriotic effort to
achieve a victory for themselves, for ' their
labor, for their occupations and for their coun
try.-"
The Jefferson County (Pa.) delegation,
1000 strong, which was the next to arrive,
was a representative one, composed of
. miners, lumbermen, farmers and working
men. J. W. Reed, the spokesman, set
forth in his address the versatile charac
ter of the delegation. Major. McKinley,
in response to his remarks, spoke as fol
lows: '
It give me great pleasure to meet the citizens
of Jefferson, Clearfield, Armstrong and Clarion '
counties, Pennsylvania. I bid you welcome to
my home and congratulate you on the bright
outlook for a return to that business con
fidence wblcn will give to this country in
creased industrial activity and greater pros
perity. I have no sympathy with the senti
ments expressed by good people of doubt
about the future.
The United States will take care of Itself,
[Cries of "Good 1Â° Good!" and ".You bet!"] and
in Its own good time and proper way, through
constitutional forms, restore this country to
its former greatness, glory and prosperity.
The Unit d States, with its wealth of resources
and the skill and enterprise of its people, can
not be long checked in its onward march.
There are some citizens In all the States who
seem to be seriously concerned, but I for one
do' not share in their apprehensions. The
great body of the people is safe; they are
steady: they are not moved by wild impulse*.
Dismal forebodings of what might happen will
not be realized. Demagogues there are in the
country who attempt to inculcate the doc
trines of distrust ana dismay among the un
employed, and in great part the men who are
inculcating that doctrine are the men who
advocated a policy that :iirst created idleness
in the United States. Applause and cries of
"That's true."] Extremists there are who talk
glibly about the war of the classes against the
masses, heedless of the effect of the logical
outcome of their false and pernicious position,
their degrading and dangerous doctrines.
Foolish men thert are who innocently dis
seminate every sort and variety of misinforma
tion, and thus do the bidding of the better
posted but more designing men, whose dupes
- they are.
Still, there need be no alarm, there need be
no excitement, there need be no abuse or ex
aggeration, for all those false doctrines and
I unworthy influences will not prevail with the
free, the independent and the intelligent citi
zens of the : United States. [Great applause.]
The great majority \ of our people are relig
iously devoted to law and order, the public
peace and public tranquillity. They love their
homes and their wives and their families too
well to stand by any; policy that will lead to
public disorder - and . disregard of law. : They
are in favor of preserving the' rights of prop
erty, the right of con:ract, the inviolability of
the public faith and the sacredness of our unÂ«
corrupted and incorruptible courts of justice.'
They are flocking to the standard of the coun
try not from one party alone but from ; all
parties with an earnestness creditable to our
patriotism and a splendid testimonial to the
strength and glory of our free institutions.
My fellow-citizens, I* have always 'believed
in the people, but I am stronger to-day in my
faith in the American people than I have ever
, been before. [Applause.] They : have been
I true in ! every crisis of the past; ; they have
f. always been on the right side in every emer
gency,' and have never : failed , to i sustain ; the
country and those policies which insured its
peace and highest welfare. The r great heart of
the American people is i moved \by the simple
consideration of what is best, wisest and most
bene Sclal to the Nation. / In i the discharge of
every public trust to which I have been called,
whether m a ; representative in* Congress or
The San Francisco Call
Governor of Ohio, I have always found that
an honest and open, frank and just appeal to
the people never failed to receive a warm and
true response. [Great applause.] It is a mis
take to imagine that the great body of our
people are not the conservative force of the
country.
More than 2000 first- voters of Cleveland,
in uniform and accompanied by excellent
bands, marched up while Major McKin
ley was addressing- his Pennsylvania visit
ors. When he had finished the Cleveland
men passed in review before him and
were loudly cheered by the other visitors
to Canton, who remained to see them.
The Cleveland delegation tiled into Major
M(Kinley r a yard and packed it densely.
The major's appearance on tbe porch
drew forth a tornado of applause which in
volume, intensity and duration has not
been equaled here. The president of t; c
First- voters' McKinley Club of Cleveland,
Otho Snyder, introduced the callers to
Major McKinley, who spoke to them as
follows:
I congratulate you upon having reached your
majority. I congratulate you on having en
tered into the fnll possession of sovreignty in
the best Government in the world.
Having been born in the seventies, you have
enjoyed the most marvelous sdvantages of the
nineteenth century. You have escaped the ex
treme bitterness of old party divisions and the
passions of a fratricidal war. You carry none
of the scars of past party conflicts. You wit
ness only, as you come to your sovereignty, a
reunited country under tbe old flag, blessed in
all its natural resources beyond any other
country, and suffering only because of the un
wise policies already inaugurated nnd tbe dan
gerous policies vet threatened. You approach
the exercise of your sovereignty, therefore, un
der tbe most advantageous circumstances, free
from any past predilections and prepared to
consider without bias the issues upon which
parties are divided.
The ballot of the young man as well as that
of the old man, the ballot of the first voter, as
well as tb at of all voters, should always ex
press the voice of truth and conscience. It
should represent the calm and unbiased judg
ment of the voter. It should embody the
highest welfare of himself, his home, his com
munity and his country. It should "never be
falfie to bis convictions or opposed to j ustice and
honor either in political or private concerns.
It should express on its face his Vst hopes and
highest aspirations as an individual citizen,
and always represent the greatest good to his
fellow-countrymen. May your votes be always
given to preserve our unity, our honor, our
flag, our currency and our country and to save
your blessed inheritance always from lawless
ness, dishonesty and violence. May your votes
always be given for a policy that shall give to
us the widest development in our unmatched
resources, the widest incentive to the inven
tion, skill and genius of our citizens, the
largest rewards to American labor and the
highest welfare of the people, and promote the
best ideals in American citizenship.
Addressing tbe Logansport delegation
Major McKinley said:
Your presence is most gratifying tome. It
means that you have a deep concern for the
welfare of your country and that you believe
that the welfare will bo best subserved by
a Republican triumph on the third day of No
vemb t. If the nnancial plan advocated by
our allied opponents be practical and sound
lhen the trainers o( our constitution wasted
very much effort in providing a plan for rais
ing money to conduct the Government. If
this new departure be in anysente practicable
then we do not need any tariff laws In this
country, any Custom-houses or any tax col
lectors anywhere, because if you can mate
mouey out of nothing by the mere breath of
Congress then it is idle to impose taxes upon
the people to bear the burden and expense of
conducting the Government.
If by mere flatâ whether it be flat to the
extent oi 50 cenu or to the extent of 100
centsâ if the Government by a mere flat of Con
gress can make mon-y. then all the work of
Washington and Jeff -rson, Hamilton and
Clay and all of the financiers and statesmen
of this country was mere idleness and folly.
Bat their work was not idle or foolish. The
Government cannot create something out of
nothing [Great applause], and the man or the
party that teaches thai doctrine teaches a
false doctrine.
After reviewing tbe tariff, he concluded I
There never was a Republican purpose that
did not seek the honor and integrity of the
United States. There U one thing our old

Lewis E. Cook of Newark,' N. J., a circus

DEATH CLAIMS A
MAN OF GENIUS
Close of the Remarkable
Career of George Dv
Maurier.
Success Brought Despondency,
and He Could Not Be
Cheered.
TALENTED ARTIST AND AUTHOR
As the Writer of * Trilby" He Made
a Reputation That Endeared
Him to Americans.
LONDON, Ens., Oct. B.â George Da
Maurier, tbe celebrated autnor and artist,
died at 8:30 this morning. His end was
very peaceful. His death was not unex
pected, though his friends hoped that he
would recover from the present attack.
Several weeks ago his condition became
alarming. He was afflicted with a comb

the Creator of "Trilby."
ination of lung and heart troubles. He
did not shosv the recuperative powers that
were hoped for, and Bteadily though
slowly failed. A week ago tbe doctors
pronounced bis condition very critical,
and he had been in th&t condition ev> r
since.
None of the London afternoon papers
announcing tbe death of Dv Maurier
gives any details o* his demise beyond
tbe simple statement that he died peace
fully at half-past 2 o'clock this morning.
A story was published in the London
papers on September 29, the day on which
the St. James Gazette announced the fact
that the distinguished artist and author
was confined to hij bed with a serious af
fection of the heart and lungs, in which
the sick man was said to be very despon
dent, and having said to his friends at his
bedside: "I cannot cheer up; J have been
successful and success has ruined me."
Tbe physicians who attended Dv Mau
rier announced that his heart had been
weak for years, and that a fortnight ago
his affection became aggravated by a
chill, the effect of which settled upon his
Jungs.
George Lewis Palmer dv Maurier, artist
and author, was born in Paris March 6,
1834, and educated in that city, but was a
British subject. His grandparents on his
father's tide were emigrants from France
during the reign of terror. He went to
England at the age of 17 and studied
chemistry under Dr. Williamson at Uni
versity College, London.
Afterward he studied painting in Paris
under the famous M. Gleyre, also in
Antwerp and Dnsseldorf. He first began
to draw on wood for Once a WeeK, after
ward for Punch and the Cornnill Maga
zine, and subsequently he joined the
Punch staff. Since that time his weekly
| drawings made him one of the best
known and most admired of the contem
porary artists and satirists. Mr. Dv
Maurier has illustrated "Esmond,'' the
"Story of a Feather," "Thackeray's Bal
lads," and many other books. He was
also an associate of the Royal Society of
Painters in Water-colors. A special ex
hibition of bis works was held at the
rooms of tbe Fine Art Society in 1885.
In 1891 Mr. Dv Maurier published a
novel, "Peter Ibbetson," in Harper's mag
azine, and in 1894 his novel "Trilby" ap
peared. The shining pages of his latest
work, "Tbe Martian," appeared in the
October number of Harper's Magazine.
Dv Maurier has lectured occasionally on
subjects connected witn his work as an
artist.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 8. -The news
of Dv Mauner's death in London this
morning was received witn profound ex
pressions of regret in literary circles here.
It had been known for ayearpa3t that the
noted artist and novelist was not enjoying
the best of health, and those who knew
him and bad seen him abroad lately had
expressed the fear that his utter collapse
might come at any moment.
Me was a devoted student â in fact a
slave to his art. Although he never vis
ited the United States many American
literatteurs knew him personally and
those in the city to-day were greatly
shocked when they beard of his death. It
was the general opinion that he had over
worked himself and comment was made
on the lamentable fact that it was in the
heyday of his fame that his genius was
cut short.
His latest work, "The Martian," mean
ing an inhabitant of Mars, is a story in his
best style. It has much of the super
natural flavor of "Peter Ibbetson," his
lirst book, the same conversational tone
of "Trilby," its charm of mystery, uncon
ventional ideas and gay artistic Parisian
The painstaking qualities of the man,
his devotion to his work and his laborious
efforts are fully exemplified in his last
novel.
For over three years he labored over the
"Martian," whicn he very carefully re
vised. It was only a short time ago that
he finished his illustrations, and they are
now on their way to this country. There
are over 125,000 words in this novel, and it
will run through ten numbers of Harper's
Maiazne. Those who have read tbe
manuscript predict great success for the
work. The illustrations are "Frenchy"
in style, and the character "The News
boj" will likely attract wide attention.
SIGHT-SEEING IN PARIS.
Czar aud Czarina Drive to the Louvre
and Examine the Pictures and
Sculpture.
PARIS, France, Oct. B.â The weather
to-day was bright and mild. The Czar
and Czarina drove to the Louvre at 11
o'clock this morning and remained an
hour examining tbe pictures and sculp
ture. Their majesties were accompanied
by President Faure.
Tbe route of the imperial visitors
through the streets was less thronged with
people than was the case yesterday and
the day before, but still large numbers
gathered along t:.e line, and these were
quite as enthusiastic as the crowds of the
previous days. The Czar looked much
better than he did yesterday, having re
covered from his fatigue and regained his
normal health.
This afternoon they visited the Sevres
porcelain factory and the museum, and
were greatly interested in what they saw.
Their majesties later went to Versailles,
w ere they arrived at 1:45 p. M.. and were
received with great enthusiasm.

Says the Colonel.
COLLEGE BwYi ARE SUBDUED.
An Attempt to Shout Down the Great
Orator Promptly Checked by
the Police.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. B.â Twenty thou
sand people went to the big Republican
tent on the west side to-night to hear
Robert Ingersoll speak. Tbe oration was
the first that Mr. Ingersoll has delivered
in a political line since the last campaign.
He was loudly cheered when he stepped
on the platform ercctea under the tent,
but it was just thirty minutes from the
time he attempted to commence speaking
to tbe time when sufficient order was se
cured to permit of his proceeding. A
number of boys from the Chicago Uni
versity to the left of the platform brought
their college yells with them and evidently
had planned a repetition of the experi
ence that Candidate Bryan met with in
Connecticut. For a time there was trou
ble, but a squad of twenty policemen with
their clubs succeeded in quieting the en
thusiasm of tbe youths, and after one on
slaught by the officers the yelling ceased.
Colonel Ingersoll requested those who
did not want to hear him to go home and
managed to get in a few cutting remarks
at the outset of his speech, but tbe quiet
which reigned when he finally got
launched into his argument was unusuaL
He said:
I admit that all the parties who disagree
with me are honest Large masses of man*
kind are always honest; the leaders not al
ways, but the mass of the people do what they
believe to be right. Consequently there is no
argument in abuse, nothing calculated to con
vince in calumny. To be kind, to be candid,
is far nobler, far better and far more American.
We live in a democracy and we admit that
every other human being has the same right
to think, tbe same right to express his thought,
the name right to vote that we have. [Ap
plause. ] And I want every one who hears me
to vole in exact accord with his sense, to cwt
his vote in accordance with his conscience.
No man ever made or created money. It is be
yond the power of Legislature and Congress.
Money is not something that man can create.
Money is something that does not have to be
redeemed. Money is the redeemer. [Ap
plause.] Anything that has to be bolstered up
with the promise of an individual or a nation
is not money. A nation can no more create
money by law than it can create corn and
wheat and barley by law. [Applause.] And
the promise to pay money is no nearer money
than a bill of fare is a dinner. [Laughter.]
Twenty-three and twenty-two one hundreth
grains of pure gold make one dollar. That is
the money to-day of the civill.td world. Ah,
but they say, "Cannot you make dollars out
of silver? 1 ' I say yes, but when you make a
dollar out erf silver you have got to put a
dollar's worth of silver in a silver dollar.
[Applause-] If you make money out of some
thing else you have got to put a dollar's worth
of something else into the dollar. It takes a
dollar's worth of pa; er to make a good paper
dollar. [Laughter.] It takes a dollar's worth
of iron to make an iron dollar, and it takes a
dollar's worth of silver to make a silver dollar.
You do not add the value of gold by law any
more than you add to the value of coal by
weighing It. Ah, but they say, '-What makes
go. d valuable is that the law places it at a
legal tender." Again you are arguing back
ward. Because it was valuable the law made
it a legal tender. And yet these gent emen
say that it got all its value from the law
making it a legal tender. It is exactly the
other way.
i Â»Tne legal tender law rests on the value of
the metaL Why is gold valuable? I do not
know. Why do most people love oysters? I
don't know. Why do so many people ge;
idiotic about election? I don't know. [Ap
plause.] But these are facts in human nature.
For some reason, or for mouoy, people give a
value to gold. And tnat value is recognized
by the law-making power, and that is all there
is to the legal tender act.
"But," says Mr. Bry ftn i "our money is too
good." How can money be too good? He
says, '"We want more money." I say yes, wÂ«
want good money, and the more good money
we have the better. There has been added to
tbe money of the world $225,000,000 in gold
in the last year, dug from the miserly crevices
of the mountains. But, he says, we want
cheap m^ney. Wny? Because the money it
so dear now the people cannot get it
He wants to get money that nobody wants.
If we get that kind ol money, who will take
It? Do you know that the words "cheap
money" are a contradiction in terms? Cheap
money is always discoun ted where people find
out that it is cheap. They have said to me
that I used to talk another wny. Twenty
years ago at Cooper Union, in New York, I
made a speech favoring honest money. I said:
'â¢I am in favor of paper, witn gold and silver
behind It I believe in silver, because it is
one of the great American products; but I
want a silver dollar worth a dollar, even it
you have to make it four feet in diameter.
[Applause.] No Government, can afford to be
a Clipper of coin. Honest money for an honest
people issued by an honest Nation."
That was where I was twenty years ago, and
tnat is where I am to-night. Better be an
honest bankrupt than a rich thief. Poverty
can hold in Us hand the jewel, honorâ a jewel
that outshines all otner gems. A thousand
times better be poor and noble than rich and
Iraudulent' [Applause.]

President Green favored a meeting of
the league only in the years when Gov
ernor and State officers are to be chosen,
or not oftener than every second year.
Mr. Woodmansee of Ohio, president of
the National League of Clubs, than re
viewed the work of league clubs through

RESIGNATION OF ROSEBERY
Comment Concerning the Sever
ing of His Leadership of the
Liberals.
Said to Have Taktn a Common-Sense
View on the Eastern and West
ern Situation.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. B.â The Star in
commenting on tbe resignation of Lord
Rosebery from the leadership of the Lib
eral party says: "Lord Rosebery has re
signed and Sir William Harcourt reigns
in his stead. Tbe Liberal party will never
again be led by a peer. Mr. Gladstone
chose Lord Rosebery as his successor to
the leadership, and it is Mr. Gladstone
who has unwittingly deposed him. 1 '
T. P. O'Connor, M. P., says in his paper
the Sun: "Lord Rosebery never had a
fair chance. Whenever he indicated a
policy it was immediately thrown over by
his supposed colleagues. Nevertheless,
everybody knows that Mr. Gladstone
stood outside of the painful intrigues,
odious bickerings and miserable personal
ities which defamed and wrecked the Lib
eral party since bis retirement."
The Evening News says: "Lord Rose
bery has played the man. He declines to
lead a party tbe ragtag and bobtail of
which was always barking at his heels.
Sheer ignorance has betrayed the ramp
into the bog in which it is at present wal
lowing."
The Chronicle says: "Lord Rosebery
throughout has taken a common sense
view of the eastern and western situation,
while the other Liberal leaders have taken
narrow and more emotional views. Lord
Rosebery's resignation -will strengthen
Lord Salisbury."
The Dublin Freeman's Journal says:
"Lord Rosebery daily gave striking proof
that his views of tbe eastern policy differed
from those of hi? party. His retirement
is not a surprise. It is his arrival on the
road to which be has long been traveling."
In the political clubs it was not
expected that Lord Rosebery would
resign the leadership of hits party
at present, despite the agitation
against him. Tbe advanced Liberals desire
a more aggressive policy, though a large
section of the party approve Lord Rose
bery's coolness in a time of feverish ei
citement.
Many liberal members of the House of
Commons wired to the offices of the Liberal
party in Westminister to-day asking for
information in regard to Lord Rosebery's
withdrawal, and received the reply that
the ex-Premier's letter of resignation was
wholly unexpected, although the Liberal
Whip, to wbom his letter was addressed,
had received a hint that it was impending.

BRYAN'S SPEECHES
AT CEDAR RAPIDS
Endeavors to Enlighten the
lowans on the Money-
Question.
Tells Them That Nothing Is Too
Gcod for the American
People.
ASSAILS THE GOLD STANDARD.
Can See No Other Issue in the Cam
paign but the Cry for Cheap
Money.
CEDAR RAPIDS. lowa, Oct. B.â Mr.
Bryan's special train reached here at 4:05
this afternoon after a remarkably quick
run from Burlington. Stops were made
at ColumDus Junction, Nicholas and West
Liberty, short speeches being made at the
first two places. His reception at Burling
ton this morning was attended by about
10,000 people. The parade and public
demonstration, however, was not so suc
cessful, over 5000 horsemen and 500
women riders having been announced as
an escort for the distinguished guest but
less than 4CO were in line. Bryan rode in
an open carriage and was greeted by
cheers several times during the parade,
but as a rule the crowd watt an undemon
strative one.
At the Coliseum 7000 listened to his
address and thousands were turned away.
Bryan later made short speeches to large
crowds from the small stands in the park
and was liberally applauded. At the
Coliseum Mr. Bryan baid:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Fellow Citizens: We are passing through a
campaign which means a great deal to tbe
American peopleâ *ye, more than that, it
means a great aetÂ»l to the people of the world.
There are crises in human affairs. While
every day Is of equal length with every other
day, yet into some days vast importance is
crowded, and into the 3d of November vast
importance will be crowded. Upon that day
tbe American people choose a President who
shall occupy the White House [cles of
"Bryan ! Bryan !"] for four years. On that day
they select a House oi R presentatives, and on
that day they select legislatures which will
choose United States Senators. Much de
pends upon the result of this election. For
the first time in the history of the United
States a parly appears which declares that the
gold standard must be maintained in this
country until foreign nations join us or per
mit us to abandon it. Never before have the
American people been asked to declare for a
gold standard. Every step that the gold
standard has taken heretofore has been taken
in the dark and without the consent Â«f the
American people, and now, for the first time,
the advocates of gold ask the American people
to indorse the cola standard at the ballot-box.
If It is right [cries of "No. no"] if it is good
for the American people it ought to be in
dorsed.
My friends, nothing is too good for tbe
American people. [Applause.] And if the
gold standard will be good for us we ought to !
have it. If tne gold standard will bring biess- |
Ings to onr people we ought to maintain it. If I
it brings cursings we ought to abandon it.
This is ihe question submitted to the American
people. I stand upon a platform, yes, I stand
upon three platforms, which agree on one
thine, and that la the gold standard ought to
be driven out oi the United states. [Ureat ap
plause.] And that in its place ought to be ]
substituted the free and unlimited coinage of i
gold and silver at the present legal ratio of 16 j
to 1 [applause] without \vÂ»;lt j ,g for the aid or
consent of any other cation. [Prolonged ap
plause.] I come to-day to submit for your con
cideration home reasons why Republicans
should join with, us unon the platform which
we have adopted. The Populists have already
joined with us. I will gay joined with us.
They may say that we have joined with them,
but I care not how you express it so we are to
gether now. [Great applause. A voice, "Hur
rah for McKinley.'' Applause and hisses.]
My friends, I bear you to refrain Irom any
manifestations of disapproval. I am glad to
have that man here who is in favor of my op
pouent. I only hope that there are many such,
because it ;s to Â»u"h persons that I desire to
express my remarks. ana applause.]
My friend has declared his preference for Mc-
Kinley. I want to ask him which McKinley
he is forâ the McKin'.ey of 1890 or the McKin
ley of 1896? [Great applause.] McKinley said:
"But all agree that we must have a larger vol
ume of money, and that the added volume
shall be silver or its equivalent based on
silver."
At that time we were putting into circula
tion about $24,000,000 a year under the Bland
act, and Mr. McKiuiey advocated the Sherman
act on the ground that it wouid increase the
amount of money to be put in circulation
among tbe people.
"We propose to give to this country what the
gentlemen upon the other side of the House
could not do. We propose to give to the coun
try a silver bill that will take all of the silver,
practically, of the United States, and make it
available :or the use of the people." Again he
said: "So. Mr. Speaker, this bill is just to tbe
silver producers of the United States, for it
does what the present law, rs demonstrated by
every administration for ten years, has not
done. It takes every dollar of silver bullion
that is. purchased in the United States and
places it at the disposal of the people as
money."
That was the McKinley of 1890. Let me
read you the McKinley of 1896: "It is not more
money we want. What we want is to put All
the money we have already at work." In
1890, when he advocated more money, we
already nddod $24,000,000 to the circulation
each year. This year we have no such provi
sion. We have repealed the Sherman law and
Bland act.
Mr. McKinley said In 1890 that Mr. Cleve
land had been discriminating against silver;
nad been trying to degrade it; had been try
ing to contract the currency, and that by
lessening the currency he made money dearer
by making it scarcer. WÂ« can support every
contention we make by quoting Republican
authorities, and therefore Republicans who
come to us in this campaign do not change
their convictions. They simply change their
party name when their party has abandoned
the position it used to occupy and now de
mands that yon shall surrender the convic
tions of a lifetime. [Great cheering and ap
plause.]
Just as Mr. Bryan was concluding his
remarks a cry of" "How about Grovei?"
came from the crowd, acd the candidate
significantly responded : "We are not
talking about him now. Since our Re
publican friends came to the support of
the administration we have not found it
necessary to say anything about it"
[Laughter and cheers.]
To an appreciative audience that filled
the grand stand and bleachers at Athletic
Park Mr. Bryan made a short speech this
afternoon, during bis stop of nearly two
hours in Cedar Rapids. Between 6ooo and
8000 people were present. John M. Ked
mond introduced Mr. Bryan, who said in
part:
The three parties which agreed on my loki
ination In view of the money question ae
clared that the most Important issue before
the country, but our opponents have attempted
to bring in other questions.
Then Mr. Bryan spoke of the right of
the people to question the decisions of the
Supreme Court, saying:
Let me show what has been said in regard to
these decisions and I will tell you the name of
the anarchist who said It: "The practical
effect of the decision to-day is to give to cer
tain kinds of property the position of favorit
ism and advantage inconsistent with the
fundamental principles of our social organiza
tion and to invest them with power and Influ
ence that may be perilous to that portion of
the American people upon whom rests the
largest part of the burdens of government and
who ought not to be subject to the dominion
of aggregate wealth anymore than tbe prop
erty of the country should be at the mercy of
the lawless." What man was it, do you sup
pose, who said lhat the people ought not to be
subject to the domination of aggregate wealth
â what anarchist do you suppose that was?
A Republican judge of tbe Supreme Court, and
his name is Har. an. Notning In our platform
is more severe than that.
The rest oi the speech was devoted to Â»
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1896.
discussion of the money question, no new
lines being taken up. Mr. Bryan left
Cedar Rapids tor Marshalltown. lowa,
over the Northwestern at 5:45 p. SI. Hia
train traveled on a special schedule.
Two meetings were addressed here by
Mr. Bryan to-night, tbe first in a big tent
erected in front of the courthouse, and the
second in tne opera-house. Both places
were crowded. After the meetings Mr.
Bryan retired on his special car, which
was attached to the regular train on the
Northwestern, leaving for Sioux City at
1:28 a. H. There was nothing new in the
first speech. In the speech at the opera
house he said ;
We depend a great deal on the clubs In this
campaign. The silver clubs must do much on
our side to offset the club that employers hold
over their employes. If some- foreign enemy
were to approach our shores I could, go among
tliese people and could enlist men who would
be willing to devote not a day, but months
and even years to repel the invaders. To-day
we are in the presence of the invasion, not of a
foreign enemy, but of a loreign financial
policy. It is invading our shores and 1 appeal
to you to enlist for one dayâ election day.
This gold standard that is worshiped by
those who dase not proclaim the god which
they worship; this gold stanGard which is
secretly advanced at every possible moment,
and yet with all its advances under cover and
behind a mask, this gold standard is to-day
threatening the American people. I want to
ask the silver clubs of lowa, as 1 have already
asked the silver clubs throughout the United
States, to do one thine that will prove their
loyalty and aid our caAe.
We are making a poor man's fieht. We have
not money even for legitimate campaign ex
penses; but, my friends, we have zeal on our
side, and zeal is worth more than dollars in
such a tight. I want to ask ti.e free silver
clubs of lowa and every silver club in the
United States to meet at the pulling-piaces on
election morning and give the whole day to
work ior free silver. My friends, this is but a
litt'.e request, and if they will comply with it
it means much for the cause of bimetallism.

Altgeid or Tillman. This. Is not an ordinary
political contest in which we are enlisted and
in which the laws of party discipline prevail.
It is a sectional socialist warfare, in which
every man must do what his 'conscience dic

to what others do. v,-.. '
The resolutions reported by the commit

consistent with the maintenance or the gold
standard; we are unalterably opposed > to , the
free coinage of silver as detrimental to the

CHICAGO, 111., Oct. B.â lt is officially
announced that the Democratic managers
are well pleased with the result of the
elections in Georgia and Florida, r They
say ' they would . have â¢' been satisfied with

GENERAL PALMER'S ADDRESS.
Denounce* the Anarchistic Planks in
the Chicago J' l at form.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. B.â Generals Pal
mer and Buckner to-night made their first
appearance before a Chicago audiencejsince
their nomination by the Indianapolis con
vention. The Auditorium, where the
meeting was held, contained a fairly large
audience, the first floor and balcony being
weil filled, but there wan no necessity for
any one to ascend to the upper balcray.
Senator Palmer saia his nomination was
not self-sought; the Indianapolis conven
tion was composed of representative
Democrats from forty States of the Union.
They considered who would best repre
sent them and they selected him. He
could not decline because he thought it
bis duty to obey the wish of the conven
tion. He did not accept the nomination
with any expectation of serving either the
Silver or Populist party ; he accepted it as
a Democrat.
The speaker then referred to the de
struction by fire of Chicago twenty-five
years ago to-morrow and to the active part
ne, as Governor, took in assisting the
people and bringing order out of chaos.
General Palmer then proceeded to de
nounce the plank in th â  Chicago platform
denouncing the President for interference
in the affairs at Chicago and the enforce
ment of the laws of the United States.
Referring to his own candidacy Genera!
Palmer said be could not blame . is audi
tors for voting for McKinley and would
not be surprised if some voted for Bryanâ
because he was aware there are a great
many curious people in the world. But
they could do better than vote for McKm
ley or for Bryanâ they could vote for
Palmer and Buckner.
General Sucfcaer. scored the free-silver
movement, and reviewed the consequences
of the war, denying lhat the demonetiza
tion of silver had aught to do with events
which have followed.

SLAIN BY THE MATABELES
Pascoe St. Leger Grenfeil Among
the White Men Sacri
ficed.
Surprised by the Blacks and Put to
Death During; a Journey in
a Cart.
NEW YORK, N, V., Oct. B.â Among the
lives of wnite men sacrificed to tbe fury of
the Matabe'es during their recent uprising
near Buluwayo, Africa, was that of Pascoe
St. Leger Grenfell, a notice of whose death
appears in this morning's Herald.
Grenfell, who was 35 years old. was the
eldest son of Pascoe Dupre Grenfell of Wil
ton .Park, Beaconsfield, England, a mem
ber oi the London banking firm of Morton,
Rose & Co. Young Grenfeil leaves a
widow in this city, the sister of 11. L.
Ashmore.
Pascoe St. Leger Grenfell was in New
York up to last winter, when he was called
away upon an important mission to
Africa by his father in London. He
reached Buluwayo toward the end of
March. There was not then the slightest
intimation in that section of the country
of the terrible native uprising. In the
companionship of Robert White, the man
aeer of the Gourley diamond mines, Mr,
Grenfell leit Buluwayo about March 22.
The country was so quiet that they tiav
eled in a bullock cart, accompanied only
by a native Cape hoy. They were bound
for Guelo, three days' journey dMÂ»nt.
The little party bad just reached tbe
Gourley mines when it was surprised by
the Matabeles. The details of what Hap
pened were not known until a month
later, when tbe commanding officer of a
detachment sent out to quell the outbreak
came upon tbe bodies of tbe two whita
men lying stripped and mutilated in the
brush. The little Cape boy had disap
peared and has not since been heard of.
Information of the tragedy reached
Claude Grenfell, a cousin of the dead man,
who owns a large estate in the neighbor
hood of Buluwayo. lie sent word to the
family in London. It was calculated that
the two men hod met their death on or
about March 25. The news reached the
widow in this city last Sunday by letter
from Mr. Grenfell of London.
Pascoe S. Leger Grenfeil was the eldest
of eight brothers. One of the latter,
Lieutenant Harold Grenfeli, is in the Life
Guards. He went out to Africa shortly
before his brother, and was present during
the Transvaal raid.

DISEASES OF CATTLE.
Possibility of Germany Placing an JEnt
bargo on American Beef,
INDIANAPOLIS, Imd., Oct. B.â From
inquiries made to-day it develops that
tbe German Government is making on its
own account an investigation of the healtn
of American cattle, possibly witn a view
of again placing an embargo upon Ameri
can beef. The State Board of Health re
ceived a letter from the German Consul at
Cincinnati asking a statement of bow
much, if any, tuberculosis existed among
the cattle in Indiana. The letter also
wanted to know what measures were be
ing taken to weed out or prevent the dis
ease, and stated that the German Govern
ment had last year expended over $400,000
in stamping out the tuberculosis among
German cattle.

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. B.â An effort is
being made again by the representatives
of English capitalists to acquire the prop
erties of all the manufacturers of plug to
bacco in this country in order to form a
plug tobacco trust. All that prevents the
consummation of the deal, so it is said, is
the refusal of one of the large manu
facturers to set a price on his property.

An Interesting Decision,
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. B.â Justice
Beekman of the Supreme Court has just
rendered an interesting decision in the
case of the State of South Dakota against
John T. McChesney. When Wiiliam
Walter Taylor was elected Treasurer of
the State 'he gave $350,000 bonds, with
seventeen sureties. Wben he defaulted
for $366,023 his bondsmen showed that the
bond required by law was but $250,000.
That amount was paid by the bond-men,
and the State then brought suit to recover
the $100,000 in addition for which bonds
had been given. McChesney, one of the
sureties, fought the case, claiming that the
State could only collect the legal amount
of the bond, and the decision rendered by
Justice Beekman sustained this view of
the case.
SAN DIEGO WATER DEAL,
A Powerful Combination Against
the Wright Irrigation
Act.
Colonel J. P. Jones Tells What the
Capitalists Are Doing in
the Matter.
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. Oct. B.â Additional
details were learned to-day of the reported
combination of capitalists to lobby for the
repeal of the Wright irrigation act in the
next Legislature, in case the Supreme
Court finds it constitutional. Colonel J.
P. Jones, ex-presideot of the Linda Vista
irrigation district, the largest in tbe State,
consented to talk.
"It is a fact that there is such a combi
nation," he said. "It took shape origi
nally in the Central irrigation district in
the vicinity of Coiusa, where they have
expended $540,000 on the development of
water and the works are not yet completed.
"The farmers in the district are tired
now, and will not vote for any more
bonds. Tbe people running the thing are
desirous of throwing the district in the
bands of the bondhelders, who are to
complete the works and charge for water
as may be arranged hereafter. I am told,
on what I consider authority, that Haggin
and Carr, and also Miller, of Miller &
Lux, are among the heavy movers in the
combination to repeal the Wright act.
"The result of the repeal will be to give
private parties a splendid chance to come
in where districts have been mismanaged,
buy up valuable water rights for a song
and secure a monopoly of the water sup
ply. I admit that in some cases there
suit would be to bring water more quickly,
but at the same time it would be out of
tbe people's hands and in those of private
corporations, which the majority of irri
gationists in this State do not want.
"I am told that Miller has already spent
$30,000 or more in taking steps to defeat
the Wright act. This plan is a part of the
one which was made public some time
ago, when it was mentioned that capital
ists were buying up irrigation bonds, or
at least securing options upon them. This
has been denied, but I happen to know
personally that it is true."
D IVINES AT SACRAMENTO
The Congregational Association
Listens to Interesting
Papers,
Members Engage in a General Discus
sion and Hake Many Lively
Points.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. B.â The
Congregational Association has been in
session all day, and in the main have been
engaged in transacting routine business.
Three papers were presented and read
one by Rev. W. W. Scudder on "Men and
the Church," one by Rev. H. Mellvill*
Tlnney on educational methods, and the
other by Dr. McLean of Oakland, entitled
"The Wheel and the Spirit Within the
Wheels," showing how the wheels that
brought us to Sacramento forty years ago
were changed much and were vastly differ
ent from the wheels that brought us here
now. His discourse from Ezekiel showed
much of application to our times and
methods in intricate yet comprehensive
figures.
At the conclusion of the three papers, a
general discussion by members brought
out many lively points, and was much
enjoyed. Professors Lloyd and Nash,
Revs. Coombe, Maar, Butler, Kobbins and
Mrs. French, presented many different
phases of tbe work, while Rev. L. H. Cal
lock made an earnest plea that the church
be the bead in all things, and unify and
sanctify secular agencies ior doing the
work of tbe kingdom.
Dr. McLean then made a report of his
efforts with the Methodist Episcopal Con
ference at Pacific Grove in the matter of
interdenominational comity. The Meth
odist Conference decided that their fun
damental principles forbade any such an
arrangement, while Dr. Dille, who was
appointed a committee on fraternal rela
tions, sent a letter to the association,
which was read, and his hope of a Chris
tian unity in tbe near future was cheered
vigorously.
The evening was consumed by the regu
t lar programme.

TRAGIC DEATH
Suicide of the Prominent
Farmer of Sacramento
County.
Many Years Ago, It Is Said, He
Became Involved With the
Southern Pacific,
HEAVY DEFALCATION CLAIMED
But H? Knew Too Much About the
Contract and Finance Company and
Was Not Prosecuted.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. BâMid
night. â Word has just been received in
this city of the suiciae of John Miller, one
of the wealthiest and most prominent
farmers of Sacramento County, wno for
yearÃ past has been a resident uf Walnut
Grove. As yet the reports of the tragedy
are meager, as the ranch of Miller is situ
ated some distance from the little village,
but it i* known that Miller has been in ill
health for some time and has been suffer
ing from severe pains in his head, which
at times have affected his mental equi
librium, and it is thought that, believing
death to be but a matter of a few weeks,
and living in dread of insanity, he ended
his sufferings with a bullet from his pistol.
John Miller was a man of brilliant at
tainments, finished education and pol
ished manners, a direct descendant of one
of the oldest families of aristocratic Vir
ginia. At the outbreak of the Civil War
be joined the Confederate cause, and
eventually became a colonel, being pro
moted from the ranks for his intrepid
bravery.
At the conclusion of the war he came to
California and located at Sacramento,
where he entered the employ of the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad in a clerical capacity
when the main offices were located in this
city. His brilliant intellect and accom
plishments soon caused him* to attain a
very prominent position, and after he
severed his connection with that corpor
ation he met and married a widow of im
mense wealth and social standing named
Terry, whose former husband had been
one of the founders of the Friend & Terry
Lumber Company oi this city, one of the
largest and wealthiest firms in the city.
Shortly after the marriage they removed
to Walnut Grove, where they purcnased
a magnificent ranch and erected a hand
some residence and have since resiled.
Mr. Miller was one of the most prominent
Democrats in Sacramento County and was
a power in his party.
Coroner Clark has just left the city for
Walnut Grove and will probably convey
the body to this city.
Some years ago Miller was secretary of
the Finance and Contract Company, now
known as the Pacific Improvement Com
pany of San Francisco. This was the com
pany that did all of the grading and track
â worfc for the Southern Pacific, in fact it
Was part of the Southern Pacific, and as
bead of its financial department Miller
was on the most intimate terms with the
heads of the railroad corporation and with
all the company's secrets.
He was discharged suddenly from bis
high position, and with the news of bis
discharge came the announcement that
f BOO,OOO was missing from the coffers of
the raiiroad. There was some talk
of prosecution, but it was learned t at
he threatened to bring others witn him
across the bay should he be sent there.
At any rate talk of prosecution subsided
and soon Milier was again a free man.
But : c never got his place back.
Soon after ne left San Francisco and
moved to the interior of the State.
SANTA ROSA SILVER BARBECUE.
Grnnd Jolliflration in Which SOOO Fer-
son* Participated.
.SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. B.â The barbe
cue of the Saverites at Sebastopol to-uay
â was a great r uccess socially and was en
joyed by fully 5000 people. The Bryan
Club of Santa Rosa arrived in a special
train, arrayed in white caps, not unlike
those affected by German bakers, with the
name of Cutler across their snowy lroms
in bold black letters. After a few marches
end couiit.r-uiarches in tlie limited space
afforded by Main street, the crowd a-seru
tled beneath the beautiful pin-s of Morris
Grove to listen to the speaking. From a
fayly decorated grand stand G. N. ban
orn called the meeting to order and in
troduced John S. Saunders as president of
the <'<ay.
Mr. Saunders welcomed the euests in
thf nam oi the people of Sebasiopol and
imroiuced Wi'iiam Craig of San Fran
ci-if o as the first speaker. Mr. Craig re
viewed tne I'Oii'ical history of tho country
Irom ihe time of Jefierson and Hamilton
to the present day, and although his
speech was somewhat too statistical for
tne crowd it was on the whole a very com
plete exposition of Democratic docsrine
and received close attention.
After the Heaidsburs Glee Ciuh had
sang "America"' and the band had ren
dered a p')jiiiiar air the president of the
day presented F. A. Cutler of Huniboldt.
Mr. Cutler received a flattering reception
and made an eloquent and impassioned
plea for si. Ver. He promised to voie for
the opening of the Nicarngna canal and to
Jollow in tne footsteps of Jud,;e Maguire
on the railroad question. At this juncture
the savory odors of barbecued meat begitn
tosaiute the old factory organs of many
people and the announcement of dinner
was hailpd with cheers.
The crowd literally "followed their
noses" to where the savory smells orig
inuted and made short work of the many
fat beeves and smaller animals provided
for the occasion.
The first speaker after dinner was Allen
Galloway of H-aldsburg, an aspirant for
Assembly honors. He was commendably
brief, and was followed oy the principal
Bpeaker of lhe day, James G. Maguire of
San Francisco.
The dense shade afforded by the trees
surrounding tne platform was something
totnlly lacking In the forenoon and a mag
nificent audience greeted t c speaker.
The familiar arguments of the silver par
ties were used by Mr. Maguire, but his
happy humor and witty applications elic
ited much laughter and applause. After
the usual cheers for everybody and every
thing in sight the larger part of the crowd
boarded the eveqing train tor their homes,
but many stayed to enjoy the grand bali
which will wind up the day's pleasures.
STOCKTON M EETING A FAILURE.
p. â  â¢ â¢â  _____ â  -
Cold Weather Chilled the Ardor of the
â  Silver -â 
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. & â To-night
about 300 people gathered on the plaza to
listen to George Fenning of Oakland, "a
representative of the Populists and Silver
.* ites, who addressed ; them s on the issues of
the day. The meeting was not nearly the
success that was expected and was disap
pointing in many respects. The speaker
paid his respects to F. X. Schoonmaker,
last night's Republican speaker, but the
audience failed to entbuse as they did last
night and there was very little cheering.
One thing that worked against the success
of the open-air meeting was the change in
the weather to-nicht, as it turned out very
c<Wd and many stayed at home. The sil
ver club here is arranging to make a vig
orous campaign and has prepared for a
number of addresses to be delivered with
in the ncx: two weeks at various points in
the county.
MONTEREY REPUBLICAN RALLY.
Hon. D McKinlny Addrenses a Tre
mendous Assetnblage.
MONTEREY Cal., Oct. B.â One of the
greatest Republican rallies ever seen in
this county was held at Bagby's Opera
house on Alvarado street to-night.
Farmers from Carmel and the Toro ar
rived in the afternoon, and the streets were
filled with country folks this evening to
witness the paraile and participate in the
rally. The speaking was under the
auspices of the McKinley-Hobart clubs of
this place and Pacfic Grove. Hon. D. Mc-
Kinlay of Santa Rosa, the candidate for
Elector, was the principal speaker of the
evening. Long before the hour for the
speaking to commence the opera-house
was filled, and when the speaker of the
evening entered the hall the enthusiasm
was very pronounced.
Men shouted and stamped their feet,
while the iadies, who constituted about
one-th'rd of the audience, were content
with tne simple waving of their handker
chiefs. The hall was artistically decorated
with ferns and palms. The stage was fes
tooned with garlands and cut flowers.
Just over the ?penkers' stand was a large
picture of Major McKinley and surround
ing this there were pictures of Lincoln,
Garfield, Arthur and Harrison. The Mon
terey brass band rendered several selec
tions just before the speaking commenced.
Captain Thomas G. Lambert was chair
man o; the evening. He made some well
directed remarks in regard to the present
campaign, and dwelt at soroe length in
eulogizing the speaker of this evening, al
luding to him as one of the most influen
tial speakers of this campaign and doing
the Republican cause more good in this
State than any other candidate.
Mr. McKinlay or ened his argument by
assuring the mechanic? and laborers of
Monterey and vicinity that he was one of
them. He dwelt at length on the silver
question and strengthened his argument
by numerous statistics. He con>umed
about a hour and a half, after which sev
eral local speakers gave their views of the
present campaign.
TACOMA'S SOUND-MONEY MEN.
Merchants Meet and Organise for Vigor
ous Campaign Work
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. B.â The business
men of Tacoma who favor sound money
and good substantial government have or
ganized themselves into a club to further
the interests of Tacoma, the State of
Washington and National Government.
Fully one-third of the hundreds who
have signed the roll gathered in the Doo
little clubrooms j'esterday afternoon and
elected George H. Stone permanent chair
man and Irofessor H. B. Dewey perma
nent secretary, and started the Tacoma
Business Men's Sound-Money Club on the
road to prosperity.
A notable feature of the club is that it is
composed of business men, without dis
tinction of party. Democrats and Repub
licans alike are joined in the singlo pur
pose of delea ting the election of the free
silver advocates. The membership turned
in numbers 248. There are upward of
fifty lists still oat with an estimated total
of SOO names more.
Chairman Stone briefly addressed the
club. He said : "I am pleased to meet
these manifestations of interest in the
vital questions of the campaign, and, re
garUiesa af party, to see the business men
standing shoulder to shoulder to say to
the people of the United States and the
people of the world tiÂ«at we stand for an
honest dollar and a chance to earn it.
"It is no longer a question of whether or
not Major McKiniey will be elected, for
news constantly comes to us from the
Eai-t of his gaining strength, that con
fidence is being restored, factories and
mills Â«re resuming operations and stocks
are advancing.
"This leaves no question regarding the
election of McKinley and Hobart. But
there is a quesiion of this State of ours
standing wiih the other btates of the
Union. Our interests, our resources de
mand thatjwe decide we will pay our debts
with 100 cents on the dollar."

assemblage from the country around and
contiguous towns, upon the political is
sues now before the people. Bonfires lit

and vicinity. The platform was erected in
the old courthouse and beautifully decor
ated with various appropriate mottoes,
California products and pictures of emi
nent statesmen, and good music was fur
nished by the Sneiling brass band.
After the song, "America," by the glee
club, Senator Smith was introduc d and
began by saying that no party in this
country had so indelibly written the
words of that song as had the Republican
party. The speaker occupied about an
hour upon the various points at issue aud
was frequently applauded.
The song by the glee club, entitled,
'R ckaby, Bryan," brougnt out great ap
plause.
Mr. B iwers then came forward and de
livered an able address, which lasted
more than an hour, and was received with
much attention and applause. The
speaker said he was frequently asked how
c could be a Repub. can and a silver
man. He answered that by saying that
he was in favor of piotection and that the
Republicans had fiiven the people more
silver than any other party, but the
Democratic party msde it their first act
upon assuming power to repeal the Sher
man law, wt'ich was a Ret Ã¼bican law,
and that it had been impossible to get a
silver bill through a Democratic Honse
when Republicans sustained it. Tne
Â«ppaker declared vehemently that if be
had his own way he would not allow a
prune, an orange or a pound of wool into
this country so long as we could produce
them.

PAST AND PRESENT CONDITIONS
Striking Contrasts of the Protective
and Free Trade Systems of
Government
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. B.â Hon. W.
S. Barnes addressed one of the largest
audiences to-nieht ever assembled in the
Opera- bouse. Fully a third of the seats
were occupied by ladies. Harding's band
led the large crowd to the Opera-house
and though not necessary to attract the
crowd, played in front of the building for
a quarter of an hour before the meeting
began.
Mr. Barnes was introduced to the audi
ence by Hon. Carl E. Lindsay, District
Attorney of this county, and was accom
panied on the stage by ex-Assemblyman
Galbraith, president of the McKinley
Club; Frank Mattison, County Assessor;
L. J. Dake, A. P. Swanton and other lead
ing Republicans. Mr. Lindsay made a
very brief but appropriate speech of intro
duction, alluding to Mr. Barnes as one of
the successful attorneys of the State and
one fully competent to address the people
on the issues of the campaign.
Mr. Barnes read his address, which dealt
with the present condition of the country
under a gold standard, with silver used
for the purpose of trade; compared the
condition oi the country as to finance and
production during the last Republican ad
ministration and at the present time, and
discussed the effect of the purchasing and
coinage provision of the Sherman act upon
the finances of the country; compared the
McKinley bill with the Wilson-Gorman
bill; showed the conditions of American
manufactures, labor and farm products
under the McKinley bill and under the
Wilson-Gorman bill; reviewed the history
of free coinage experiments and history of
silver-stanuard countries, comparing them
with the condition of the United States at
the present time, and gave a general view
of his opinion of what the condition of the
country would be in case of the election of
Bryan and in case of the election of Mc-
Kinley.
Mr. Barnes is accompanied by Walter S.
Blair of his staff. They will return to San
Francisco to-morrow, and on the 12th
inst. go to San Diego, to speak there on the
14th. Thence they will work up the coast,
taking in points between San Diego and
Santa Cruz.
SACRAMENTO DEMONSTRATION.
Army . and lary Republican .League
, Hold* a Routing Meeting. ,'
SACRAMENTO, â  Cal., Oct. B.â The
Army and Navy Republican League held a
rousing meeting at their headquarters in
this city this evening and listened to a
brilliant address by that eloquent young
orator, Judson C. Brusie, Republican nom
inee for State Senator from this ; district.
The speaker alluded to the battles of the
Civil War, leading his hearers bacK to
camp life and conflict on a hundred bat
tlefields and called upon them to again
rush into the i, reach formed in the ranks
of the followers of Bryan and uphold
the standard of McKinley. . -\> '.-.â
' Durine the , meeting the Resolutes 100
strong in full uniform entered the hall in
solid phalanx and : loudly cheered the
battle-scared veterans, who responded in
kind. The Resolntes then marched to the
State ' Capitol ; and cheered ; Secretary of
State Brown, who appeared and delivered
a very neat * speech )on the - issies of the
National campaign, which he declared
would, owing to what he had learned dur
ing his recent trip through Eastern States,
undoubtedly result in M< Kinley : polling
the largest vote for President ever known.
This brought forth burst after burst of ap
plause from the cub and the hundreds of
spectators who had been attracted to the
Capitol Park by the mass of torches and
the music of the Resolute Drum Corps.
' After parading the principal streets the
club retired to headquarters.
To-morrow night â : the uniform : rank of
the Assembly clubs will be in evidence in
their natty uniforms of blue. Member
ship in this club has b en limited to 150.
There have been over 500 applications, but
it is impossible to obtain sufficient uni
forms. , '.
TAILOR AT SAN DIEGO.
The Colorado Silver Orator Undertakes
to Refute Butterworth
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. Oct. B.â W. F. Tay
lor of Colorado .who, it is alleged, was
sent out to Calif >rnia by the Teller inter
ests to counteract the influence of Ben
Butterworth of Ohio, spoke here to-night.
He had a large audience and was treated
with respectful attention.
"I am from Colorado," he began, "and
I say Colorado will give 100,000 majority
for Bryan; and I know, though you may
not, that California will give Bryan 40,000
majority. I am a free-silver lunatic, a re
p'ldiator, a follower of strange gods, but
if the other fellow takes all the men who
are hurt by free silver and I take all that
are helped I will bury him so deep that
Gabriel's trumpet will never find him."
The speaker attempted to undo Ben
Butterworth's magnificent speech in this
community in the cause of sound mon*-y
by quoting Butterworth's letter written
last M:iy, in which he advocated silver;
but Butterworth had already shown thi
consistency of his views at that time and
at present, so that Tavlor's effort fell flat.
Through all the speaker's talk there was
the thread of free silver, though he occa
sionally strayed to some other topic. Ac
cording to the plank in the Democratic
platform favoring State's rights as ai-ainst
Federal authority in the matter of sup
pressing riots Taylor said:
"I say let the people of a State alone
and they will manage their own affairs to
suit themselves without the interference
of Federal bayonets,"
Soon after Taylor cried: "I come Irom
the South and as the offspring of an old
rebel know the power of this gieat Gov
ernment. 1 -Â« v that when you meet to
ratify tiie election of William Jennings
Bryan for President, from every hamlet of
the South, from the everglades of Florida
to the panhandle of Texas, will arise the
old, wild, sweet rebel yell in the same
cause, to celebrate the same victory, under
the same nag.'*
In reiterating his advocacy of free silver
he sasd: "All vhat is necessary to restore
the value of silver from fi.ty-three cents to
$1 29 is to put the stamp ol the Govern
ment upon the coin, and the immutable
law of supply and demand will force every
man to take it and pass it. Ben Butter
worth may not know a way to make Eng
land come to an agreement with us with
the silver question, but I know a man
somewhere out in this country to-night
speaking to countless thousands of needy
and hungry American who gaze up into
the inspired face of William Jennings
Bryan while he tells them how he would
make the money power of the world do
the bidding of the United States."
PASADENA OUTPOURING.

ster Republican Gatherings.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. B.â The largest

red fire added to the scene. Bands were
stationed in fronc of both halls and the
Americus Glee Club furnished patriotic

stirring address of the campaign, speak
ing as one inspired, and his every salient
point was received with prolonged bursts
of enthusiasm. Colonel Jackson also de

Kinley and protection and sound money.

GOOD TEMPLARS 1
WORK AT VLLEJO
Third Day's Session of the
Grand Lodge Is a
Busy One.
Matters Re'ating to Reircorpora
tion of the Orphans' Home
Discussed.
GOOD OF THE ORDER REPORT.
Important Recommendations for the
Guidance of Subordinate
Lodges.
VALLEJO, Cal., Oct. 3.â The third
day's session of the Grand Lodge of Good
Templars was an interesting one. The
morning session was occupied almost en
tirely in considering matters relating to
reincorporating the Orphans' Home.
A very affecting scene transpired upon
the entrance of Past Worthy Cbiel Templar
Hoag in the Grand Lcdee. He had just
come up from Fresno, where he had at
tended the funeral of his wife, and while
on the floor Past Grand Chief Templar
Kanouse stepped to his side and, taking
nim by the hand, started to sing in a low
voice "Shall We Gather at the River?"
The response was taken up by the entire
membership and at its conclusion there
was scarcely a dry eye in the audience.
Consideration of committee reports was
then taken up and acted upon as follows:
Your committee on good of the order have
taken under consideration the various matters
committed to it and recommend the following
for adoption:
That portion of the grand chief templar's re
port consisting of the preamble we recognize
and heartily indorse. We also recognize the
fact, as stated in clauses numbered 1 and 2,
that we never have recovered from the unfor
tunate rupture wnich occurred in 1884 and
1885 in our order. We can only deplore the
fact, but can really find nothiue to justify the
Indifference of the class referred to in our
great work.
To the class referred to in clause 3 we
regret that any shou.d become weary in well
doing and retire ircin active service in the face
of the foe, or that any should neglect the du
ties of the subordinate lodge for the less impor
tant, though po-sibly more conspiorous, posi
t on in the Grand Lodge, or on public occa
sions.
Your committee is of the opinion that in
order that a member may be able to become
efficient in the Grand Loage he must be first a
useful member of a subordinate lodge, and as
a step in that direction your committee would
recommend that the Graim Lodge constitution
be so amended that the credentials or certifi
cate ci election of a delegate Irom a subordi
nate lodge of this body shall set forth the fact
that the elected delegate has been in attend
ance upon bis subordinate lodge for at least
one regular meeting night per quarter during
the past year.
To those mentioned in clause 4 of same re
port we have no word of censure. We recog
nize the W. C. T. TJ. and the various church
and religious societies as most worthy and
wel. -appointed organizations, doing a grand
work, and surely as our most noble allies, and
wish them God speed.
We are sorry to have any sever their connec
tion with us, but we can truly congratulate
ourselves that as a prior temperance organ
ization we can own them as our offspring, and
we will still labor on in the faith ; that our or
der is mO9t potent for good; that we have the
ideal organization, whereby the whole family
circle is complete within the iodgeroom. with
no distinction of race or sex, and that our
work p ainly teaches the great thought of
fraternity and Christian principles of the
fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of
man.
We cannot particularize other paragraphs
from 5 to 11, but admit in general the cor
rectness of the report. In reierence to para
graph 12, we deprecate the lack ot Christian
or even fraternal charity often exhibited be
tween members toward those who may differ
with them politically or otherwise.
Do not let us los>e sight of the fact that we
are a fraternity bound together by mutual ob
ligations, cemented by common experiences
and desires: that we are reformatory in char
acter and educational in our nature; that we
come from ail ranks and party affiliation, wiih
no desire other tnan patriotic: thai our sym
pathies are alike for the advancement of our
common cause, and that we differ in judgmeut
only. Our platform is broad and complete;
let us live up to it according to the best light
uod may give.
Ihe ben ncial feature submitted to us from
the grand chief templar's report we find ably
dealt with iv the grand secretary's report. We
think the latter has well settled the matter by
saying that a uniform! y in the order is a ne
cessity, and as the Supreme Lodge has the
matter in hand we advise letting it rest until
some future session.
The line of work as reported by our Grand
Lodge officer shows new lodges worthy of
sp<cinl mention. We heartily indorse the idea
of encouraging local workers and the "hand
to-hand" and ''house-to-house" work, also
fraternal lodge visitations, and that wherever
practical more than one night be given our
lectures in each place.
The grrtnd vice- templar's report Is worthy
of indorsement by this Grand Lodge.
That portion of tne grand secretary's report
referred to your committee has been already
dealt with in a general way.
George D Kellogg,
F. M Reynolds,
Theo D. Kanodsk,
Committee on Good oi the Order.
The committee on laws and usages re
ported as follows:
Against admitting secretaries of the Y. M.
C. A. to membership in subordinate lodges
fiee.
Against changing the term of probation for
receiving the district degree from one to three
months.
To-nieht a considerable sum of money
was pledged for the Orphans' Home.wbich
is receiving much attention at this session.
Many of the Grand Lodge members
visited the home to-day.
At the afternoon session the matter of
piacing the home under the management
of the executive committee and reincor
porating was finally disposed of by mak
ing no change in the number on the
board of lady managers of the home.
In the evening the matter of fixing the
salary of the grand chief templar for the
ensuing year was discussed until 8 o'clock,
without arriving at a definite conclusion,
and the Grand Lodge adjourned to the
Metiiodist Church, where a large audience
was in waiting.
At an open meeting called in the inter
est of the Orphans' Home quite a lar^e
sum was realized for the benefit of the in
stitution.

CLOVERDALE'S CITRUS FAIR.
New and Elegant Pavilion to Be Erected to
Make Room for the Many Ex
hibits Promised.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Oct. 8. â Opera
tions will be commenced immediately for
the erection of a magnificent pavilion, to
be used especially for the holding of future
citrus fairs in this city. The fairs of the
past two years have proved such great
successes, that they have outgrown every
large building in town, so it was seen that
as a matter of necessity a new building
was needed to accommodate the enlarged
exhibits and increasing throngs who come
to behold the golden fruits.
About a year ago the Cloverdale Citrus
Fair Association was organized and incor
porated, for the purpose of advancing and
encouraging the citrus interests in this
section. A splendid building site of nearly
an acre of land in the hsart of town was
purchased, and now a tine buildiiig is to
be erected on it, suitable for citrus fair
purposes, while the Burrounding grounds
will be beautified with paim, orange and
other semi-tropical trees and shrubbery.
The board of directorsâ John Field (presi
dent), W. T. Brush, Charles E. Humbert,
M. Menihan and F. W. Bush â met last
night and completed the final arrange
ments for beginning immediate work on
the building, awarding the construction
to George W. Coe, a local contractor.
Tne dimensions of the building are 56
by 120 ieet and it will cost about $3000. It
is to be constructed mostly of wood and to
be fini hed by the time of the Molding of
the fifth annual citrus fair, which will be
about the middle of February. Most of
the stock to pay for the construction is
subscribed and that nearly all by citizens
of Cloverdale aud vicinity, although all of
Sonoma County and the adjacent county,
Mendocino, is taking a lively interest in
the project.
This is an important step in the advance
of tins county, as it goes to show the in
creasing importance of our citrus indus
try. Tne orange and lemon crop is look
iDg splendid, giving promise of an excel
lent display at the next citrus fair.
KILLED ON FELIX KIDGE.
Thomas Ornbaum Mistakes Charles
Mrarit for a Deer While Hunting.
TJKIAH, Cal., Oct. B.â Word reached
here to-day from Booneville of another of
tbose peculiarly sad accidents which have
unf rtunalely been quite frequent this
summer. Charles Hearst, in company
with Joseph Frye and Thomas Ornbaum,
were out hunting on Feliz Ridge. They
separated, Hearst taking one direction and
the otner two leaving on a trail which
forms a crescent leading in a straight line
from where the party separated. Alter
they had been separated for some time
Frye called his companion's attention to
what he thought was a large buck. Orn
baum raised vis Winchester and fired, and
both rushed to where the object had
stood, when they were horrified to find the
dead body of young Hearst. He bad been
shot through the head and was instantly
killed. Hearst was 21, the others about 18.
No arrests have been made.
Both young men were highly respected
in the community where they lived, and
the shooting is believed to have been purely
accidental.
CAUGHT A HUMAN FISH.
John Fuss' Body Brought Up in a Net
at Aberdeen.
ABERDEEN, Wash., Oct. 8. â Last
evening a fisherman known as Austrian
Pete, while drifting for salmon in tne har
bor, felt an unusually heavy weight on
his net. Upon hauling up the net he
founrl the dead body of John Fuss en
tangled in the meshea. The Coroner
was at once notified and took the body in
charge. Fuss had been drinking heavily
and after 6 o'c'ock last evening left Do
lan's saloon, on the corner of Heron and
F streets, telling his friends that he was
going to "jump overboard." They paid
fnt.e attention to his remark, as he had
frequently threatened to commit suicide.
He was last seen alive about 7 o'clock and
his being picked up so soon afterward is
very remarkable. It is supposed that he
jumped from Barrow's wharf.

STAGE HELD UP
IN NEW MEXICO
Passengers Relieved by the
Bandits of Money and
Overcoats.
Said They Were the Atlantic
and Pacific Robbers and
in Hard Luck.
ANOTHER COACH IS HISSING.
Last Heard From Wednesday N.ght
and Has Probably Mst the
Same Fate.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mex., Oct. B.â
The stage from San Antonio to White
Oaks was held up yesterday about forty
five miles east of San Autonio on the east
ern slope of the Oscuro mountains, a few
miles from the station known as Red
Rock. The stage that left White Oaks for
the west yesterday morning and should
have reached San Antonio last night has
not been heard from 'and is supposed to
have met the same fate. The robbers se
cured $50 in money and helped themselves
liberally to overcoats and boots. They
told tne passengers they were the same
parties who had held up the Atlantic and
Pacih'c train and excused themselves for
taking articles of clothing because they
had been playing in hard luck lately â did
not secure anything from the train they
held up and had their leader killed.
After the hold-up the stage went on to
White Oaks and from there it is sixt, r
miles to the nearest telegraph station.
It seems that while Loomis and party
were searching for the bandits in the
Magallan mountains after the Atlantic
and Pacific hold-up the robbers eluded the
pursuers by changing their course to the
eastward, crossing the Rio Grande a little
below Socorro and making across the
country in the direction of the Texas line.
A posse has gone in pursuit of the rob
bers, though there is but little hope of
finding them. The section in which the
robbery yesterday occurred is one of the
wildest anywhere in the Southwest and
with the exception of two stations main
tained by the stage company there is not
a human habitation between Sau Antonio
and White Oaks. It U not far from this
place tttat Colonel A. J. Fountain and his
son were. killed abour five months ego
while returning from Whit* Oaks.

His. Bar Bitten Off at El Monte.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. Bâ An applica
tion at the Receiving Hospital to-day to
have an ear sewed* on brought out a queer
assault case which happened at the little
settlement of El Monte last Friday nigiit.
F. L. Meadows, a teamster, was assnuited
by a lot of drunken rowdies near the Savan
nah saloon, and one of them finally bit his
ear off. A country doctor sewed it on, but
it did not stay, hence his call at the Re

FOOTBALL WORK
AT PALO ALTO
Practice Games for the Con
test With the Olym
pics.
The Second Eleven Gives the
First a Hard Rub for
Supremacy.
PLAYERS OF GREAT PROMISE.
Registrar Elliott Compares Last Year's
Major Students With Those
of This Year.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
Oct B.â Football practice is becoming
more like the real game as the time for
the first match with the Olympics comes
on. Last night the work of the men was
much more snappy and vigoroas and freer
from bad fumbles than it has been for
several days. There was considerable
open play and long runs were not infre
quent, when kept the crowds of student
spectators on the bleachers in good hu
mor. The second eleven gave the first a
hard fight for supremacy and at times
â¢â¼en bad the best of it.
Clemens '00, a new man here, and brother
of the "star" halfback who practically won
the first Intercollegiate game for Stanford
against Berkeley, was on the field and
made a good showing at fullback, though
quarter is bis position. He is a quick,
heady player and seems to have many of
the qualities in him that pave his brother
a record among Stanford ites that will go
down with the annals of its athletic his
tory.
Soper '98 is constantly improving in his
line-bucking, but still runs too high. His
tackling seems much improved aud his
punting as a rule is very good.
Lou Freeman : 99. who has made a good
showing as a candidate for fullback and
whose punting is surer than any other J
man's who has yet turned out, is again at j
work. It was greatly feared that he would
be prevented from trying for the team.
Just now there is mourning over ths
fact that Stanford is about to suffer an
irreparable loss in Murphy '00, the crack
quarterback. He has been forbidden to
play, and unless his parents rescind the
edict the football squad will lose one of its
most promising players. There are hopes,
however, that the parental objection will
be removed.
Harrington '98â "Big Bill," as he is
known to most of the enthusiastsâ has
been playing a star game at tackle. At
running with the ball he is a remarkable j
ground-gainer and his aggressive work of
late haÂ» been very goon. Jack Rice, at
right tackle, is also playing a strong hard
game.
For a new man, Young '97 is making a
creditaDle record at guard in Captain
Fickert's place. As he learns the game he
develops many of the essential qualities of a j
first-rate guard, and his tine physique gives
him a decided advantage in his race for a
Varsity place. He weighs 195 pounds.
"Heffeinnger" Williams '97 is playing
a steady game at guard, and is recognized
as one of the ola reliables.
Dole '98 and Ben Thomas '97 are two
of the strongest candidates for half. Dole
is a fine runner with the ball and blocks
veil for a runner. Thomas is strong at
bucking, and is a pretty tackier.
Parker '99 and Adams '93 are also do
ing good work.
Registrar Elliott has just prepared a
comparative statement of last year's major
students with this year. It is peculiarly
interesting as showing the tendencies to
change from one specialty to another. This
year there appears to be a strong tendency
on the part of many to study in economic
branches, -following is a summary by

field, and on July 15 last found rich crop

has been developed tbat has been the talk
of all Kern County and that part of the
State.
The mine is in the Randsburg district
Mr. Borgwardt and Mr. Pyle are much
pleased with their discovery. They be
lieve it is one of the great mines of the
country.
"There are now about 40 feet of develop
ment on it," said Mr. Pyle, "and this is
by a single shaft. Both walls are granite.
At 26 feet there were two feet of ore and
at 30 two and a halt were shown. I have
just received a letter from Mr. Wright,
the foreman. He says:
" The vein consists mainly of rose-colored
quartz, carrying sulphurets and lree gold,
'i'nere is a liebt-colored quartz, blue stained
aad impregnated with sulpnureis. It lies next
to the talc on the foot wall. Ore-sorting and
sacking is progressing, as is extracting.
"We have made several shipments of
ton lots of ore to this City," continued
Mr. Pyle. "The first lot ran $140 a ton
and the last till now $800. We have some
to hear from. I think it will average about
$300. So far the average has been about
$250.
"The vein crops out on the surface for
3000 leet. The vein doesn't show all the
way, however. In some places it is cov
ered by the sand, but substantially it con
tinues for the distance stated.
"Though this mine is on the Mojave
Desert, and there are wide wastes of sand
about there, yet around the mine are a
great many mesquite bushes. They are or
a deep bluish green color, and thus relieve
the desert of much of its forbidding char
acter. The trees are so plentiful that you
can't drive a wagon through except by
zi gzapging."
Mr. Pyle was a member of the Legisla
ture from Santa Clara in 1885, when he
settled in KÂ«rn County. He is a brother
in-law of James Rae. 'Santa Clara was the

HE HAS LOST IS NAME
Carl Henderson Disappears Under
the Sobriquet of Mr.
600
It Is the Amount It Cost Him for
Cutting the Cable cf a Sutter*
Street Car.
As if he had dropped on a deserted
island long before he was old enough to
know his own name Conductor Carl Hen
derson of the Larkin- street system of
streetcars has lost his identity.
He is now Mr. 600, or plain 600, for the
matter of that. Were be married his wife
would be known as Mrs. 600 aad his babies
the little six hundreds.
It is an odd story of how a sobriquet
will supersede a rightful appellation when
circumstances of a striking nature cre
ate it. '
Henderson is a powerful, good-natured
and honest Swede who has devoted most
of tbe fifteen years he has been in this
State to either driving a streetcar or hand
ling a grip on the tramways. A frugal
man, without even the petty vice of chew
ing tobacco or smoking a pipe, he man
aged after some years of steady work to
accumulate some $600.
This was as far back as three years ago
when in one moment of thoughtlessness
he lost his entire savings.
This is how it occurred: Carl was grip
man on a south- bound Larkiu-street car.
It was his duty when nearing the Sutter
street crossing to raise bis grip and allow
the car to cross the Butter-Street tracks
and cables by the force of its own mo
mentum. But he didn't do it
There was a crash. Carl's grip was bent
up and a few windows in his car were
shattered. The passengers were not much
hurt, but only shaken up a bit. But the
serious damage was done to the Sutter
street cable. The grip simply cut it in
two and it took an entire day to rejoin the
ends.
After an escapade of that kind Carl's
job was as good as lost and tie knew it.
The superintendent of the road ordered
him to report off, and crestfallen and de
jected be turned in.
Not only was he discharged, but before
be was given his walking papers he was
told of the terrific amount of money he
had caused the company to lose. It was
somewhere in the neighborhood of $1000
in nickels and dimes.
Carl went his way thinking the matter
over and speculating on the excessive cost
of cables.
That afternoon, the honest Swede re
turned to the superintendent's office and
walking un to his desk laid down a sack
of coin, saying as be did so:
"Mr. Superintendent, you don't know
that I was not to blame, but I know. I
have not money enough to pay you all the
$1000, but a Henderson always pays what
damages he makes." Then Carl started
to walk out.
The | superindendent was durrn'ounded.
But he called the man back, counted the
$600 out, put it in the safe and said:
"Henderson, take your grip as usual
in the morning."
Henderson's escapade cost him $600, won
him a name and ne is still plodding away
at $2 10 per day.
PHELAN CAMPAIGN OPENS
The Junta Wing of Local De
mocracy Ratifies Its
Nominees.
A F mi y Githenng in Odd Fellows'
Hall aad Speeches by Several
Candidates.
The Junta branch of the local Democ
racy opened its municipal campaign to
the public last night at Odd Fellows'
Hall.
In the course of his speech James D.
Phelan, the young candidate for Mayor,
denounced the City's Boards of Super*
visors and expressed the desire to aspire
to merit the good things that the other
speakers had said of him. He could not,
as Sutro had, promise the people a tire
cent fare to the ocean, but he could prom
ise them good streets, and whatever little
good he coula do the City of his birth
would be a labor of love.
Dr. C. f. Clinton, nomineÂ© for Super
visor of the Eleventh Ward, said that
too often Supervisors have taken the op
portunity to fleece tne people.
James E. Britt, candidate for Supervisor
of the Ninth Ward, confined his brief re.
marks principally to an exposition of the
question, "Who is the man tbat can de
feat C. L. Taylor for Mayor?"
Stephen R. O Keefe, nominee for Police
Judge, declared that the Police courts of
this City have been a stench in the nos
trils of decent people for years and that if
anywhere a new broom is needed to swep
clean it is in the Police courts.
John O'Gara, candidate for Justice of
the Peace, told of bis own comra endable
past and pleaded earnestly lor votes.
William A. Asmu-ser, candidate for
Treasurer, declared that he was no orator,
and no one appeared to doubt it.
Charles Gilde a, candidate for Supervisor
of the Tenth Ward, characterized the of
tice he sought as a thankless and unpront
able one that often proves a graveyard to
the incumbent's reputation. The some
one in the gallery repeatedly rang a bell
and be sat down.
"Now, gentlemen," said the chairman,
"I have tlÂ»e very great pleaure of intro
ducing to you the next Mayor of San
Franciscoâ Mr. James D. Phelan."
Mr. Phelan Said :
. 4 Gentlemen: Â I feel i that these are more than
my deserts, but I promise you I that this confi
dence in me shall not be misplaced should I be
elected. I shall alia high, though I fail.

est Since her marriage to Price she has
borne him three children.
Last night, between 7 and 8 o'clock,
Mrs. Price was putting the youneer chil
dren to bed. The youngest cbild went
into the sitting-room, where Price was, to
kiss him good-night. Tbe little thing
knocked over something and hurt her
foot and began to cry. Price picked up
the child, and Mrs. Price went into the
sitting.room and said to Price : "Give me
the child and I'll put her to bed." Price
roughly replied: '"Get out of here, or I'll
slap you in tbe mouth."
Edward was in the kitchen and over
heard Price's threat He went into the
sitting-room, and raising his hand ad
vanced toward Price saying: "You must
not strike my mother. lam here to pro

from tbe mantelpiece and plunged them
into Edward's left side.
Edward returned to the kitchen, fol
lowed by his mother. He out on his coat
and hat, and remarking to her, "Mother,
I have been stabbed," he left the house.
He walked about a block, as far as Army
and Howard streets, and dropped to tbe

"My wife and I had some words to

to -lap her lace, although I did not intend
to do so. The young man jumped in and
said he would do nic up and with that be
struck me twice in the face. He was a
powerlni young fellow, over 6 feet tall.
"There was a pair of scissors on the
mantelpiece and to defend myself I
grabbed them and made a jab at him. He
sneaked out of the room and into tbe
yard and about fifteen minutes' 'later I
was arrested and brought here.
"It is not the first time tie has beaten
me. About a year ago while I was in bed
he gave me such a severe beating that I
did not get over it for some time.
"I had no intention of seriously injuring
him, but made a jab at him sojas to drive
him away from me, an I could not do any
thing with him with my fists."

POTRERO'S DEVELOPMENT
Inhabitants of Hills and Valleys
Mingle on a Common
Plane.
The work of developing the Potrerogoes
cteadily along. The catting through of
Mariposa street, from Mississippi to In
diana, will be finished Dy the end of this
week.
The contract called for the removal of
30,000 cubic yards of earth, at an expendi
ture of $700 '>, and when finished will give
the people of the Petrero a direct thor
oughfare to tbe principal portion of the
City, notably the City Hall and that por
tion of Market street west of Kearny.
This will obviate the necessity of coming
round by tbe tedious way of Long bridge,
with the inconvenience of waiting for the
drawbridge at the foot of Fourth street.
With the cutting of Mariposa 6trpet
Seventh, Eighth anu Ninth streets can be
entered by a direct line from the Potrero,
as also the Mission proper through Six
teenth street Heretofore the Â£an Brano
road had to be traversed to gain an entry
into the Mission from anywhere east of
the Mud Slough and Biuerock Hill.
In addition to this by the end of the
present week Indiana street north of
Twenty-second, formerly Sierra street, will
also be cut through, and the men now
working there will l>e shifted to Twenty
second street facing Indiana, where a large
cutting will be made penetrating into
"Sunshine Valley." This section has here
tofore been almost isolated from the out
side world except to itje goat family and
the nimble-limbed inhabitants, who set
tled there in the fall of '49 or the spring of
'50. This job will require about four
months to finish. After this tbe Potrero
Land and Improvement Company tnat
Has done so much to develop the barren
locality of the biuerock region wili switch
their men and teams to cutting through
other barriers, which will require a couple
of years to accomplish.
E. Worth, who had the contract for
cutting through Fifteenth street from
Bryant avenue to San Bruno road, a dis
tance of six blocks, will have completed
his contract, tnus making an additional
opening from the progressive section into
the Mission at its most southwestern
boundary.
At the Union Iron Works the iron
frame and roof over the new boilershop
have been put in place, and before the end
of tbe present month the building will
assume such shape as will jnstify the i>lac
iug of the requisite machinery within the
walls.
Activity on board the battleship Oregon
is evident from the engineers' department

5 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLMO, SCHOONMAKER
AND HIS TRIP
Forcible Speech in Oakland
by the New Jersey
Man.
What He Found in Illinois,
South Dakota, Nebraska and
Wyoming.
VALUE OF MR. BRYAN'S SPOON.
Farmers Are Looking at the Silver
and Protection Issues in a
Practical Way.
F. X. Schoonmaker, a bright journalist
of New Jersey, who is here in the interest
of protection to American labor against
the competition of foreign pauper labor,
is a distinguished looking man in the
prime of life, with hair prematurely
white, forming a strong contrast to his
healthy, pink complexion.
He said to a Call reporter last night
that McKinley would carry the State of
Illinois by 200,000 plurality. Leading
Democrats of Cook County, in which Chi
cago is situated, concede that county to
McKinley by 75.000.
Mr. Schoonmaker went on to tell aDout
the great change in public sentiment
which oas taken place during the last few
months in Illinois. It was supposed all
ulong that the rural districts were for
silver, but he did not believe that they
ever had been. They believed that the re
duction of the tariff on wool and other
articles closed the Eastern factories and
caused the distress among the working
people and the general depression in
prices. But when the silver men came
out and saiit that the distress had been
caused by a dearth of silver they listened
to them. The novelty has worn away,
and the State will give a bigger majority
than ever before for the Republican party.
â¢'The State Central Committee in Illi
nois is a splendid organization led by
John Tanner," said Mr. Schoonmaker.
"He is one of those men very like Abra
ham Lincoln, and always on the ground
with both feet."
The next State visited by Mr. Schoon
maker was South Dakota. It is only
twelve years old and its pioneers are
young* and energetic The State once
went Populist and for that reason its
credit was almost ruined, capital being
scared away. Senator Pettigrew of that
St?.te, thinking that the silver lever would
last, bolted the National Republican Con
vention at St. Louis and hurt the credit of
the Btate still more.
The system of agriculture in that State
has become more diversified, no less than
117 dairies having been established there
within the past two years. These need
protection. The people intend to redeem
their credit this year by giving McKinley
the largest possible majority in order to
show beyond tbe possibility of a doubt
that they have returned to sound business
principles.
When Bryan was nominated Nebraska
was for him by 30.000 plurality. Tbe Re
publicans quietiy took a poll *nd they
found that success was about an even
thing. It happened that crops were ex
traordinarily "heavy there this year and
the farmers found that they had some
surplus to sell. Then they began to look
around for customers, but found the peo
ple of the East unable to buy their prod
ucts because of tbe shutting down of the
factories. Then the farmers reasoned that
if Bryan should be elected he would not
take his seat until March 4, and the new
Congress would not meet until next De
cember, and they could not afford to hold
their produce till then.
They reason that if McKinley should
be elected capital would be unlocked and
the factories would be opened the day
alter election and they would find an im
mediate market. The city of Lincoln will
give 2500 majority for McKinley.
"The shopkeepers and business men of
that city are wild about the crowds that
are going to Canton, Ohio, to -see Major
McKinley," continued the speaker, "tie
fore election day probably a million peo
ple will have visited Canton, and as each
person will spend there, on an average,
$3, that means $3,000,000 to the stores and
hotels of Canton. The people of Lincoln
say that if Bryan would only stay at home
and not rnn around the country like a
â fool he would have a million of people
comins to see htm in Lincoln and leaving
$3,000,000 there, too."
Wyoming is for silver and McKinley,
strange as it may appear. The people
have numerous undeveloped resource-, in
that State which need the aid of capital
and protection, and the people feel that in
order to attract capital the State must be
under sound Republican rule. They say
that McKinley, with the Republicans and
better element of the Democrats behind
him, can be trusted to do more for silver
than the office-hungry gang behind Brvan.
Mr. Schoonmaker told that in New York
there were about 1,200,000 voters and j
1,700,000 savings banks depositors, tbe de
positors exceeding the voters in number
by half a million. Bryan went to New
York and saM to those depositors:
â¢'Your money is now equal to 32 to 1,
but vote for 16 to 1 and you will get one
half of what you hayÂ« now, but after
awhile it will be 32 to 1 again.' ' He asked
those depositors to cut the value of their
money in two.
Mr. Scboonmaker was for Â»even years a
member of the staff of tbe New York
Times. After that he went into the Press
Association business and was the first gen
eral manager and organizer of the United
Press. He was succeeded by Walker D.
Puillips. Mr. Schoonmaker is now the
American manager of tbe Central News
Company of England. He is not now
connected with the United Press.
IN OAKLAND.
A Stronar and Concise Speech by
Mr. Schoonmaker Last Night.
OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. B.â The Republi
cans of ihia city crowded Exposition Hall
to-night Jo listen to the Hon. F. X. Schoon
maker of New Jersey. The speaker was
escorted to the hall by the Army and
NiTy Veterans, 100 strong; Republican
League, headed by a band; the Young
Men's Republican League in uniform,
fifty strong. The speaker was accom
panied in his carriage by Judge
Hamilton and Fred Stratton. The
Forty-eighth Assembly Club in whit*
uniforms, forty strong, followed. In the
front seats sat 100 mem bars of the Women's
Republican Club of Alameda County,
Alice I. Wells president, with their beauti
ful badges.
A. C. Henry was chairman of the even
ing, and after a short address by Fred
Stratton introduced the Hon. F. X.
Schoonmaker. He began unpacking a
igrip, saying, "I always tell people that
â when a man goes so far from home be
Should go well loaded." Continuing, he
said : ''Every dollar I have I have earned,
and I Know no way by which I can net
any without working for it. I don't care
a cent for the Republican party as a party
nor for the Democratic party as a party. I
%m oat for F. X. Schoonmaker and the
butter on his bread. Whichever party
will help him most will get my vote.
"Every man voter is â and I hope soon
every woman in California will beâ a
shareholder in this country, and every
four years you hold your annual meeting.
When you held your last meeting you
were asked if labor tiad not been well paid,
capital invested, business good and agri
culture prosperous. You admitted it, ano
were asked to return the directors. The
other side admitted all this, but urged you
to vote for a new board who would give
you free trade. 'While you had been pros
perous you will be more so under a free
trade board of directors.' Well, you did
it, and now how do you like what you got?
"Do they come before you now and
point to their promises, saying they have
kept them and asKing you to continue
them in office? No. They would not do
that, but as they never kept one of those
promises they now come before you with
more promises to break. Tuis time they
offer you free silver."
He then treated of the cause of hard
times. Stopping of mills, he said, threw
men out of employment, caused railroads
to stop hauling coal, lime and all raw ma
terial, thus throwing more men oat of em
ployment He asserted that 7,000,000 men
had lost their positions during the four
years, and that on each of them five de
pended, making 35,000,000 people affected,
and as these grew poorer they nad to stop
using flour until it had affected the farmer
to the extent of 187,000,000 bushels of wheat
He then produced a five-dollar gold
piece, a gold eagle, two packages of
50 pennies, 20 Mexican dollars and 10
American dollars and a silver spoon.
With these he began, and in very care
fully worded and plainly demonstrated
propositions carried his audience through
the money question.
"Here is a spoon you can buy at a jew
eler's for 50 cents," he said. "I owe your
chairman a dollar, I give him this spoon
and say, 'Here, Mr. Man, take this spoon
and blot off my account.' "
"He says 'Oh, no, Mr. Jeweler, I can
buy that spoon for 50 cents.' I say 'You
won't?' 'Well, I'll get even with you; I'll
vote for Mr- Bryan and when he is elected
I'll send this to Washington and have it
coined into a dollar and then you will have
to take it.' [This set the house yelling
and stamping which was kept up for sev
eral minutes.]
"I know that Mr. Bryan is either con
sciously or unconsciously an enemy of
silver and I tell you how I know. Once there
was a great statesman that had a Yankee
notion of trading. That was James Gril
lespie Blame ami he put in his time trad
ing, and every time he traded he got five
marbles to our one. He attached the re
ciprocity law to the McKinley bill and
with that our goods go into every country.
Mr. Bryan was a man that voted to repeal
the reciprocity. If McKinley is elected we
will have that bill re- enacted."
ITALIANS AROUSED.
Bryan's Editorial Insult to the Sons
of Italy Has Caused Excite
ment.
The large Italian colony is much stirred
up by a controversy arising out of the
gratuitous insults to the Italian people of
America which were uttered with ruth
lessness and brutality a short time ago by
Bryan's newspaper, the Omaha Worid-
Herald.
As was reported in The Call at the
time, the World-Herald, of which W. J.
Bryan was then the responsible editor,
discussed the Italian population in its
editorial columns on August 8 and
12 last, and spoke of the Italian im
migrants to America in many terms
of scorn and contempt, calling them
the most undesirable class that
came to our shores and asserting that as a
whole they were of the criminal class,
ever ready to ply their stiletto. The mat
ter was taken up by the Italian press
throughout the country, including I'ltalia
of San Francisco; but it did not reappear
in the local English papers until Monday
morning, when the Examiner presented
a report of a meeting of the small Italian
Democratic Club in which the paper
credited Dr. Pescia with saying that he
was glad to see that I' ltalia had come out
for Bryan and nad thrown to the winds
the Republican accusation that Bryan's
paper was opposed to the Italians.
Either this speech or this newspaper re
port or both were pure fakes, and the
Italian colony, three-fifths of which is
for McKinley, is much stirred up about it
and about the vigorous articles which are
appearing in l'ltaiia.
The incident is of much importance and
interest among the Italian population, and
L'ltaiia in its issues of Saturday and Mon
day last gives much space to a clear expo
sition of it. By Saturday's issue of the
paper it appears that the eil itor, weeks ago,
sent to the editor of the World -He raid a
telegram of inquiry which was never an
swered.
Then l'ltaiia of Chicago took up the
matter vigordusly. Soon C. Dondero, sec
retary of tbe Italian Chamber of Com
merce here, wroie a personal letter of in
quiry to Mr. Bryan and he received a
reply in which Bryan inclosed a copy of
a brief denial of responsibility which he
had sent to l'ltaiia of Chicago, which did
not publish it.
In this denial Mr. Bryan simply said
that he was only the financial editor of
the paper and was not accountable for the
particular utterance in question.
It was in a spirit of fairness thai l'ltaiia
published the letters of Dondero and
Bryan on Saturday, but the paper ac
companied them with its unmistakable
declaration that as Bryan had recently de
ciared through the press that bis only in
come was that derived from his editorship
of tbe World-Herald he was responsible
for the utterances of his paper.
Thus the absence of foundation for the
Examiner's report of Monday morning,
and yesterdav-s .issue, of l'ltaiia devotes
considerable space* to forcibly refuting the
fake story and reasserting in a fair spirit
the opinion of the paper that Bryan was
morally responsible for the wanton insult
of the Italian people offered by the paper
of which he is editor.
''But, after all," says l'ltaiia," these
outrageous slurs on the Italian people are
not the chief, or indeed a very important
reason for our oppoeition to Mr. Bryan's
candidacy. This matter, important as it
may be, is incidental. We will continue
to oppose Mr. Bryan, because we honestly
believe ttiat his election would bring ruin
to the American people."
The Woman's Annex.
This evening tbe Woman's Annex of tbe
National League will bold a meeting at
their headquarters, 24 Fourth street. Mrs.
Nellie Holbrook Blinn and Edgar Peixotto
will be the principal speakers. All of the

Duhem, Mrs. Albert Noble, Mrs. J. Mur
ray Bailey and Mrs. Maud Jamieson.
Ben Butterworth.
General Ben Butterworth of Ohio and
Colonel George Stone, president of the
Union League Club of San Francisco, will
return from Southern California to-mor
row morning.
General Butterworth will address the
big meeting to be held at Palo Alto Satur

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1896.
THE FIGHTERS OF
THE NEW CHARTER
How They Are Massing
Their Forces Behind
Joseph I. Dimond.
John McCarthy Opens Out in
Behalf of the Teachers and
Speaks of F. A. Hyde.
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE LINE
The Hibernia Bank Flooding *the City
Hall With Dimond Badges and
tbe Fight Is On.
The plans for the organized anti-charter
fight about to be launched proceeded
actively yesterday among the conglom
eration of forces which the friendn of
Joseph I. Dimond are industriously mass
ing behind him, but night came without
the initial move which will signal the
opening of the campaign being definitely
announced.
This initial move wili be a great public
anti-charter mass-meetine, at which
vigorous speakers will talk and at which
steps wili be taken to organize an anti
charter campaign association, which will
have a carefully selected campaign com
mittee and abundant moral and financial
support.
The leading friends of Dimond and the
leading opuonents of the charter who are
associated in this incipient campaign fight
have figured out a complete municipal or
ganization which will extend not only to
every Assembly district but to every pre
cinct in the City.
This organization will extend as well to
School, Police and Fire departments of the
City and in other directions and the old
politicians who wili direct the anti-char
ter campaign do not expect to lose any
tricks.
As stated in yesterday's Call this cam
paign will ostensibly be anti-charter, but in
reality pro-Dimond.
An effort is being made to organize the
School Department in opposition to the
charter; the Police Department is asserted
to be already solidly arraigned against it,
and the political influence of the Fire De
partment is expected to be exercised in
the same direction.
The organization representing the com
bined liquor interests is also understood
to be against the charter and in favor of
Dimond, and the local Populist vote will
of course accompany the Buckley vote.
The Hibernia Bank people are already
taking a very active interest in the move
ment. Richard J. Tobin and Thomas R.
Bannerman are also interested. J. F. and
Matt I. Sullivan are at the front
of the fight. Patrick Ready 's services
are on tap. John McCarthy, the whole
sale tea and coffee merchant, president of
the Occidental Club and friend of Super
visor Dimond, is one of the strong direct
ing forces. Among others who are ac
tively concerned in this movement which
is about to break into the local campaign
and become one of its hottest features are
Judge W. G. Burke, Thomas J. Glynn,
E. W. McCarthy, A. T. Spotts. J. S. Rey
nolds, James H. O'Brien, W. J. Bryan,
Samuel E. Beaver, John Bergez, A. A.
Hooper, John Van Bergen, Rudolph Her
rold, Frank D. Bates, J. I. Mahoney and
others. It is currently said that James H.
Barry will support the movement.
With these and other forces behind the
movement tÂ»nti-charter literature will be
freely distributed, two or three public
meetings a night will be held, a thorough
house to house canvass will be made, the
main municipal departments will be or
ganized as far as possible into anti-charter
machines, and Joseph I. Dimond and the
rest of the Buckley-Populist ticket will be
kept to the front as the political incarna
tion of the doctrines preached.
One of tbe most active and influential
factors in this campaign is John McCar
thy, who was mainly instrumental in se
curing Mr. Dimoud's nomination. Mr.
McCarthy is especially opposed to the
charier and he is specially interested in
Mr. Dimond's election,
"I ara against the charter and will help
defeat it, said Mr. McCarthy yesterday.
"I agree with the views of Mr. Dimond as
they were expressed in his letter t> The
Call to-day, and I have not the slightest
doubt in my mind that the charter will
be defeated.
'Our campaign will have several feat
ures. The rir-it one will be the charter.
Then we will present our platform and
our nominees to the people, and we are
willing to accept the people's judgment on
them. But the charter wili be our main
fight
"I wish to say what I believe has not
been generally said before, and that is
that I positively know that the provisions
of the charter relating to the public
shoots were practically formulated by F.
A. Hyde, tbe recent boss of the Bchool
Department, who is a leading light in a
certain well-known secret society.
"Since Mr. Hyde's retirement to private
life by the vote of the people two years
ago, be has been constantly, covertly and
insidiously intruding his influence into
the affairs of the School Department at
every opportunity. He did so openly not
long ago when he went unasked and un
welcomed before the Grand Jury and vol
untarily argued for a reduction of teachers'
salaries.
"In more quiet ways he has constantly
tried to make his influence feit to gratify
a feeling of revenge against the teachers
who, together with the public, made his
reappearance in public life impossible.
He got in his work on the Board of Free
holders and the objectionable sections I
charge mainly to F. A. Hyde. They are
just lice Mr. Hyde's clever and insidious
ways.
"But the teachers and the intelligent
friends of the School Department realize
tliat in the requirement of semi-annual
teachers' examinations there is an oppor
tunity for an appointed Board of Educa
tion to prescribe examinations wh;cli in
scope and percentage requirements might
throw out three-fourths of the teachers in
the department.
"The most successful and most valuable
primary teacher in the department who
graduated from a college or normal school
ten years ago misht not on sudden notice
make the required percentage in geology,
physics or languages and would become
with a crowd of othera the patronage
creature of the board.
"The requirement that a teacher must
have been educated in the public schools
of this State I especially object to. If the
finest teacher who ever succeeded in
Massachusetts or New York chose to come
to California to reside the new charter
would prohibit her being hired as a teacher
in our public schools, no matter what her
experience or special ability might be.
"Mr. Dimond and his frienas opposed
Mr. Hyde's school department scheme in
the new charter, and from what I actually
know of the sentiment I can procla m
that the School Department will be united
against tbe new charter and in support of
Dimond." v_

THIRTY-SIXTH DISTRICT.
Unlform Drill Corps of the Thirty-
Fifth Republican Assembly
District.
A rousing meeting was held by the
Thirty-sixth Assembly District Repub
lican Club at their hall, corner of Twenty
eighth and Church streets, last night.
The hall was crowded and the speakers,
George W. Elder, Republican candidate
for Superintendent of Streets, Cord
Wetjen, Republican nominee for Treas
urei, and John Harney were received with
enthusiastic cheering.
An important feature of the meeting
was the attendance of tbe drill corps of
the Thirty-fifth Assembly District Repub
lican Club. This club is the banner Re
publican district organization with a
membership of over 1000 voters, and their
drill corps of 100 men is the finest uni
formed political squad in the City. Their
officers are: V. F. Northorp, colonel;
Buron Kelly, captain; E. A. Grant, first
lieutenant; E. H. Herrick, second lieu

INVINCIBLES ENTERTAIN,
Addressed by Hon. W. G. Hey
burn of Idaho and Mrs.
Carrie Catt
Sam Booth and H s Ca ifornia Ma'e
Quartet Add to the Enjoyment
of tbe Occasioa
One of the most enthusiastic meetings
of the campaign was held at the Audito
rium last night, under the auspices of the
McKjnley Invincibles. The hall was
crowded to its fullest capacity, many stand
ing in the aisles and doorways, while the
platform was filled with members of both
sexes, the ladies having rallied around the
person of one of their champions, Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt.
The Hon. A, W. Scott, who acted as
chairman, made a few introductory re
marks, and ended by introducing W. B.
Hepburn of Idaho.
"The Democrats are always trying to
fake up some reason why the Republicans
should be deprived of the handling of the
reins of government," he said. "Four
years ago we were said to need free trade.
They dared not give it to us, but con
tented themselves with tampering with
the tariff and injuring the revenue of the
country.
"This year we need something free
again. It is now free silver. Their mo
notcnous chant is that the tariff is no
issue at all. We are happy to differ with
them."
After an exhaustive treatment of his
subject, Heyburn concluded by stating
that the Republican ia the only party in
favor of bimetallism -the other unnam
able ones being really for silver monomet
allism. If the people only trusted in the
party of prosperity McKinley would go
into Washington the worthy leader of tne
people.
After tbe applause had subsided Sam
Booth and his quartet sang the "Repubi
can Tinkers' Chorus." Tney were garbed
as tinkers, each man carrying his tools.
Mrs. Catt followed with a very pleasing
address and made an eloquent plea for
equal privileges with man for her sex.
BONDSMEN TRIUMPH.
Two Exciting Scenes Ending in At
torneys Taking Their Clients to ' .
â 'â  ; the City Prison. -.^ Â/â < ;
Louie Lubock, a porter, was arrested
Wednesday night for carrying concealed
weapons. Yesterday Attorneys Rose and
Becksy saw him in the City Prison and
agreed to procure his release on bonds on
payment of $50. Lubock agreed to the
proposition and they provided the neces
sary bonds. Lubock asked the two at
torneys to go with him to Oakland and he
would pay them the money.
The three took a car, and on the way to
the ferry Becksy fell asleep. Lubock took
advantage of the occasion, as Rose islnme,
to slip out of the car and run down First
street. Rose awoke Becksy and the latter
ran after Lubock. He overtook him at
Mission street and grabbed him. A strug
gle ensued and soon a crowd gathered and
threatened to lynch Becksy. By this time
Rose appeared on tbe scene and told the
crowd that Lubock was a fugitive from
justice and Becksy was an officer. The
crowd had respect for the law, and Becksy
and Rose kept hold of Lubock and took
him to the City Prison, where he was sur
rendered.
Another case of almost a similar kind
occurred on Oak street and Van Ness
avenue during the police review. Attor
ney Friedlander was one of the bondsmen
for Theodore Goodkind, charged with ob
taining money by false pretenses. He
was arrested on September 29, and taken
before Judge Joachimsen and released on
bonds. The case was called on three
different occasions, but Goodkind did not
appear, and the Judge threatened to for
feit his bonds. Friedlander saw him yes
terday afternoon watching the review,
and grabbed hold of him. A struggle en
sued and Friedlander drew his revolver.
The crowd gathered round them and Po
liceman Hennessy appealed. Friedlander
explained the position of affairs and he
and Hennessy took Goodkind to the City
Prison, where he was surrendered into
custody by Friedlander.
The Divorce Courts.
Augusta Schmidt was yesterday granted a
divorce from Charles Schmidt by Judge San
derson. Desertion was the cause.
Wan Qul Ying secured a divorce from
Cheaung Qui Lun. Judge Troutt made the
decree because of the husband's willful neglect.
Anna A. Woodward was given a divorce from
James H. Woodward by Judge Troutt because
of her husband's failure 10 provide. Btie was
awardod $15 per month for the support of the
minor child.
Judge Seawell granted a divorce to Eliza
beth Seinman from Caspar Seinman for deser
tion.
Fire Commissioners.
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday after
noon and fined William Delaney, engineer of
engine 9 five days' pay for neglect of duty. A
charge against George Cook, hoseman of en
gine 83 of fighting at Ocean View was dis
missed, as It was shown that Cook acted in
self-defense.

A HURRICANE
BOXING CONTEST
George Green Wins a Hard
Decision Over Tom
Tracey.
The Fastest aod Most Stubborn
Ten Rounds Ever Wit
nessed.
A GRAND DISPLAY OF SKILL
Wa ker of Australia Got a Decision
Which Should Hive Bern Given
to Charley Turner.
George Green of California got a de
cision over Tom Tracey of Australia in a
ten-round boxing contest which was de
cided last evening in Woodward's Pavilion
under the auspices of the Occidental Ath
letic Club.
That it was the greatest boxing contest
of a limited number of rounds ever held
in this City goes without saying.
It was slash and cut from start to finish
of each round, and at the end of the tenth
the consensus of opinion was that it
should have been declared a draw, al
though when the spectators will realize
that Green sent bis opponent to the floor
several times â which must count against
tne downed man â possibly the referee,
who was Young Mitchell, stated rightly
when he decided in favor of Green, who
won on a very small margin, however.
Tracey, the Australian, put up a won
derful fight, and too much credit cannot
be given to him. In the first five rounds
he literally punched holes in Green's ribs
and stomach. Each time that the native
son led with the left Tracey would send in
a right over Green's short ribs that made
the recipient of the blow wince. But
Green was game and took his medicine
like a brick. He was the stronger man of
the two, and when clinched he forced
Tracey against the ropes, where several
hot rallies resulted, with Green generally
coming out of the scrap a winner.
In the fourth round Tracey had a good
lead and it looked as if he would put Green
to sleep, but George clinched to avoid
punishment and thereby saved himself
from a knockout. Later on Green had
Tracey goinc, but failed to take advantage
of openings which might have landed him
a winner.
It was, however, a remarkable fight,
which will long be remembered by the
old-timers who witnessed it as the fastest
ten-round contest that has ever taken
place in this City.
Previous to this, event Charley Tamer
(colored) and George WalKer of Aus
tralia boxed ten rounds. WalKer got the
decision, but Turner was certainly en
titled to it. "Kid" Howard of Victoria
and Jim Brown (colored) of Oakland
boxed six rounds to a draw. The fight
between Green and Tracey was as follows:
It was 10 o'clock exactly when George
Green, 145 pounds, and Tom Tracey made
their appearance within the ropes. Both
men looked in splendid trim for a hard
battle. Green was esquired by Bob Mc-
Arthur, Long Agnew and Billy Arm
strong. Tracey was looked after by Billy
Delaney, "Spider" Kelly and Jim Carr.
As neither of the contestants could set
tle upon a referee, Young Mitchell, at the
suggestion of the friends of the fighters,
was chosen to act. Tracey had a good ad
vantage of Green in tbe length of reach of
arms and height
First roundâ Very clever fiddling. Green led
and fell short. More fiddling and drawing
out, when Green led with left and landed
lightly. A clinch followed. Green again
landed on stomach, but Tracey came back
with two hard lefts on Green's body. Green
rushed in and got home twice on Tracey's face
with left. Tracey landed two hard left swings
on Green's stomach near the ropes. Green
then came up again and gave Tracey half a
dozen left-hand warmers on the face. Both
fighters came up hard against the ropes in a
clinch and in the breakaway Tracey swung
hard on Green's neck and was hissed.
Second roundâ Green went right after his
man, but missed two s wines and Tracey
viciously fought him to the ropes landing
right and left on the wind. Green, however,
was not to be denied and again forced the
fighting, landing left and then rlpht on the
face. Tracey rushed Green Into a corner, but
did not do much damage. The men came to
the center of the ring and both landed hard
punches. Tracey kept up his rushing tactics
and Green stopped. Round ended with
Green's mouth bleeding.
Third roundâ Green led for stomach and
missed. Green missed with right and Tracey
landed on Green's jaw in a clinch. Both
clinched again, fighting with their rights.
Green rusnes savagely at Tracey and punched
the Australian hard in the stomach. Terrific
fighting followed and both men slugged like
demons and it was give and take without a
moment's rest up to the time of the bell.
Tracey fought very wickedly and young Mitch
ell stepped in now and then, thus giving
Green a chance to recuperate. Tracey fell
on his knees just before the gong sounded.
Both men were dead tired when time was
called.
Fourth round â Green again went after his
man, but Tracey was as anxions as the Callfor
uian, and got Green on the ropes in Tracey's
corner and punched furiously. Green got
awÂ»y, however, and landed a right swing on
Tracey which knocked him down. Tracey
wrestled, and Green kept playing for his op
ponent's body. He finally got Tracey in
Green's corner, and almost had him out when
he wrestled him to the floor. Tracey stayed on
his knees until nine was counted, when he
rose. Green got him again, and the round
wound up with Tracey down and three
counted.
Fifth roundâ Tracey came up weak, and
Green punched him hard in the stomach.
Green was fresh, and sailed into Tracey with
right and left. Lots of Clinching folio wed. In
a breakaway Tracey caught Green a hard left
hook on the chin. Tracey was wrestled to the
ground, and remained down nine seconds, and
when he got up he seemed to have regained
his second wind, and made it hot for Green. It
wag give and take until the gong sounded,
and everybody pronounced the fight the
greatest they had ever seen.
Sixth roundâ Tracey come up rather strong,
but Green got in a heavy left on his wind and
proceeded to hammer him all over the ring.
Tracey took hia punishment gamely, and
punched Green viciously whenever he got in
close. The men were both tired, and Tracey got
in as close as possible to avoid punishment.
After a fierce exchange Tracey fell into Green's
comet, and on rising tried a right-hand La
Blanche swing. The round ended with both
very weak.
Seventh roundâ Green toed toe scratch the
fresher man. Green was the first to land a
right over Tracy's heart and then a left hook
on Tracey's law. A clinch followed, and in the
breakaway Tracey caught Green on the mouth,
bringing blood, and Green landed most blows,
but they did not seem to have much power.
Tracey rapidly recovered his|wind and settled
down to jab Green hard in the face and mouth.
Green was getting weak and Tracey getting
back to his old for form. Considerable clinch
ing was done in this round, both men trying
to avoid punishment.
Eighth roundâ Tracey came up strong. Both
men tiadled a great deal, when Green got in a
left hook and forced, the Australian around
the ring. Both landed lightly and seemed a
bit timid. Tracey landed a stiff left on
the body, and followed it up with a straight
left flush on the moutn. Tracey forced Green
to the ropes, but did no damuge. Tracey tried
rushing tactics, and the round closed with
clinches. It looked as though there would be
no knockout.
Ninth roundâ Tracey started in wickedly,
and bit Green a left-hand swing in the
stomach and a right on the neck. Green took
his medicine and got back at Tracey near the
ropes, where considerable give and take re
sulted. In a hot rally Gretn cut Tracey's
right eye open with a swinging blow. Hot
fighting followed, with both men landing
rights and lefts. Tracey had a shade the best
of this round.
Tenth round â Green rushed and Tracey
i clinched, but on breaking both resorted to

BILLS OF THE HORNITOS,
A Disagreement About Them Be
tween E. W. Holbrook and
S. Weber Parker.
Mr. Parker Delays an Eastern Trip
to Give His Sideâ Expects to
Spend $500,000 Here.
8. Weber Parker of New York, presi
dent of tbe Hornitos Mining Company of
Mariposa County, was late yesterday after
noon served with a subpena at his room
in the Palace Hotel, to appear before
Justice Groezinger in answer to a suit
brought by W. E. Holbrook for f 278.
Mr. Holbrook has been the agent of Mr.
Parker for some time past and claims this
amount is owed to Chapmnn & Bannister,
civil engineers, for work. He also claims
that Mr. Parker was on the point of leav
ing for the East, and that be also owes tbe
Haas Bros., Davis, Carrigan <fc Hayden,
the Lundy Furniture Company and Le
Conte Bros.
Mr. Holbrook served the notice on Mr.
Parker, and claims that it was done with
difficulty, his finger being caught in the
door and considerably bruised.
Mr. Parker tells a different story. He
cays that he has given Mr. Holbrook
$1350 to pay all the bills, the total of which
amounted "to but $1300; also, that in re
gard to the particular bill of Chapman <fe
Bannister, he gave Holbrook $75 to pay
for tue work, and that it was specified this
was all it should cost.
"The fact is that Holbrook and I have
had a quarrel and he wants two-fifths of
the mine. He lately took an English ex
pert toexamine the property," said Mr.
Parker, "and the expert reported it far
richer than anybody had supposed. Hol
biook claimed to me to own the mine,
when he didn't. He has no interest in it.
"He thinks now that he will take an
advantage of me; but I will not permit it.
I will stay. If I owe anybody anything I
will pay it, for that is tbe way I do.
When the matter conies up everybody
will Know all the facts."
Mr. Parker says his company will spend
about $500,000 in the Hornitos mines. As
sociated with him are several English
capitalists. Mr. Parker also says that Mr.
Holbrook and three other men came to
his room but that Holbrook was not in
jured by him in any way.

JTOB TICK-PRESIDENT-
. . GARRET A. HOBART, of Hew Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Beware the campaign canard.
The fusion lye works have fired up.
If you see it in a Popocrat organ it is
only "so so.
Popular subscriptions to thÂ« fusion fund
is the latest take.
Democratic leaders of National fame are
where? And echo answer* where?
The opportunity for voting for Colonel
Taylor is the opportunity for good govern
ment. â 
You are working for municipal reform
when you work for the regular Republican
ticket. ' -.
Ths music of Republican harmony will
sound as the funeral march for Buckley
and Hainey.
While Bryan appeals to certain classes
of the people McKinley speaks for the
masses every time.
We do not propose to be a Nation of re-
Tuidiators, says McKinley, and the people
are with him on that.
Governor Budd, Mr. Foote and Mr.
Barry all made speeches and said nothing
of Cator. How was that?
As the Democratic warhorses say noth
ing of Cator it is perhaps fair to assume
they think nothing of him.
â  The American farmer has the best home
market in the world, but if he wishes to
keep it he must vote to protect it.
McKinley has served the country well
in war and in peace, but when did the boy
orator ever serve the country at all? "
The time is near at hand for the Demo
cratic managers to issue something like
the Morey letter, ana don't you forget it.
Experience has taught this country
more in three years than Bryan can make
it forget in three months with all his talk
in-. . : -â¢â â¢;'â¢-â¢
Bryan . poes out of his way in every
' speech to make some sort of attack on Mc-
Kinley, but McKinley hasn't noticed it
yet- ' . - â  â 
\ The Democratic campaign is still waiting
for some man of ability to speak for Bryan.
The shallows murmur, but the deeps are
dumb.
The chasm between the Buckley and
Kainey factions is wide enough : for
united Republicanism to march through
10 victory. ' j ,
In talking of Republican coercion and
bribery Bryan has descended from the low
level* of the demagogue to the mire of the
blatherskite. â  _
Drop a dollar in the fusion, plot-machine
and get a fifty-cent dollar after election.
"What kind of game is that to play on the
workingman?
Whenever, an old Democratic warhorse
is forced into the field for Bryan he comes
into sight snorting with rage and kicking
like a bay steer.
There are some people who say things
cannot be any worse than they are now,
but all the same we had better not take
any. chances with Bryan.
Governor Budd says he would preside
at a Salvation Army meeting if it was for
silver, but really the Governor ought to
be willing to talk for salvation even with
out silver. '
The Democratic managers have sent out
the story that i the Republicans .in Ohio
are on the run, but neglected to add that
they are running to win, while the Bryan
ifes are limping along behind.
One of the Republican amusements dur
ing tbe rest of the campaign will be that
of shooting Democratic canards as they
fly. The bag of dead-duck roorbacks after
election will be the largest on record.
Business men know they would never
discharge a man whom they bad tried and
found capable and faithful for the sake of
making room for an untried and inex
perienced man, and therefore they will
vote for Charles L. Taylor for Mayor.
Governor Budd came down from Sacra
mento last Wednesday to preside over a
"silver mass-meeting" at 'Metropolitan
Temple. It will be noticed as a significant
fact that this meeting was called by Wil
liam P. Lawlor, chairman of the Califor
nia Silver campaign committee, not by
"W. H. Alford, chairman of the Democratic
State Committee. The boy manager of
the boy orator's campaign in California
was baring another quiet day.
AN INSULT TO VETERANS.
The editorial in The Call of yesterday
directing attention to the utterances of
"Coin" Harrey \nd the expressions of the
Bryanite press of Omaha assailing and re
viling the ola soldiers who constitute the
remnant of our country's defenders in its
hoar of peril has awakened the ereatest
indignation in the minds and hearts of
the veterans to whose attention it came.
This feeling of indignation found expres
sion at a meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Veteran Soldiers and Sailors'
Republican Club of this City, where resolu
tions were passed strongly denouncing
those who were engaged in traducing the
men who risked their lives for the preser
vation of our Nation.
The rebuke thus promptly administered
to those who can fir.d no better method of
campaigning than that of vilifying and
ridiculing the veterans of the Grand Army
of tho Republic should meet with con
currence in the opinions and expressions
of every patriotic American without refer
ence to party lines. The debt of gratitude
which is due to this diminishing remnant
of the Union armies Â©f the Civil War
should check the pens and tongues % of
demagogues whether in the sanctum or
on the stump from such utterances as are
credited to '"Coin" Harvey and the Omaha
press.
The fact that an old soldier chooses to
be loyal to the Republican party and to
promote the election of one of his com
rades who has been made its standard
bearer is no excuse for reviling and no
justification for abuse. The remaining
officers and privates of the Civil War are
not "old wrecks" in the invidious sense of
Harvey's reference, and if they are
old and battle - scarred they' are en
titled to that reverent regard which
every grateful nation bestows upon
those who bravely and willingly
devoted their lives to its service. Neither j
should it be said, or if said should it be
allowed to go unrebuked, that they "have
lost their honor and patriotism" because
they choose to be Republicans and to vote
for Major McKinley.
It will be surprising indeed if the local
feeling of indignation over this slander of
the ola soldiers is not repeated through
out tbe Eastern States with an emphasis
which will cause such demagogue s as
Harvey and the Bryanite editors to hide
their diminished heads.
The history of the Chicago conven
tion was a cyclopedia of errors, a whole
dictionary ot disasters. Its record waÂ«
a tale of lost opportunities and splen
did impossibilities, and after they ad
journed they could 'well look around
them and say, in the language of '
Charles II of England, "I always ad
mired virtue, but I never could Imitate
It." They did not construct a plat
form; they merely ran up a scaffold.â
Horace Porter.
THE STATE CAMPAIGN.
The Republican campaign in California
has been well managed and from all re
ports is proving effectual for the National
ticket in every part of the State. No loyal
Republican can iind any fault with the
management of Major McLaughlin and
his colleagues of the State Central Com
mittee. On tbe other haud the party has
every reason to be well pleased with their
efforts and gratilied by the success at
tained.
The State committee has put able
speakers and workers into the lieii and
the local committees in all parts of the
State have cordially co-operatÂ«>d in pro
moting and advancing the good cause. As
the San Diego Union says: "No men can
present Republican principles more
forcibly and eloquently than General W.
H. L. Barnes, Hon. Samuel BC Shortridge,
General John P. Jackson and a dozen
others who might be named and who are
already doing good service for McKinley
and Hobart in California."
The only cloud upon Republican pros
pects in the State is that which has been
raisea in this City by a class of Republi
cans who have bolted the regular local
ticket of the party and refused to submit
to the decision and authority of the State
Central Committee. This defection, how
ever formidable it appears now, will
surely diminish as election-day ap
proaches. AH Republicans are aware that
with the present divisions in the Demo
cratic party a united Republican organi
zation would be sure of victory and would
poll in San Francisco a majority lar^e
enough to assure the electoral vote of
California to McKinley and Hobart.
It needs no argument to convince any
intelligent Republican that the duty of
all members of th.c party is to support the
Stale Central Committee by all means in
their power. The situation speaks for it
self. The divisions in the Democratic
party are caused by fundamental prin
ciples and cannot be reconciled in t.is
campaign. Local Republican dissensions
have been caused by matters of minor
importance, anjj, moreover, they have
been appealed to the State Central Com
mittee and impartially adjudicated. All
Republicans, therefore, can honestly unite
for victory. Tne State Committee de
serves support. Let it be piven loyally-.
From the close of the war to the elec
tion of 1892 onr revenues bad been
constantly eqnai 1o onr expenditures.
As the issue at that election was almost
purely a revenue one It is only fair to
attribute to It the change iv conditions
which Immediately followed.
Webster's famous trlbuto to Hamilton
if it were inverted would very nearly
describe what happened after the pres
ent administration came into power. It
â mote tbe rock of our National reeourccn
and the abundant streams of revenue
ceased to gush forth. It struck the
beautiful and erect figure of our public
credit and it fell lifeless at it* feet.â
Hon. S. AT. McCall.
CAMPAIGN CANARDS.
It is evident that tbe stage of the cam
paign has been reached when tbe usual
Democratic canards will begin to fly about
the country. Some of them have already
made their appearance. They are of two
kinds. First, those which aim to induce
the people to believe that the Republican
party is resorting to bribery for the pur
pose of carrying the election, and secondly,
those which endeavor to lead credulous
fools into the belief that men of capital
and managers of great industries are try
ing to coerce their employes into voting
tbe Republican ticket.
Some of these canards have already ap
peared, and fortunately their contradic
tions have followed swiftly after them.
We published yesterday tbe statement of
the proprietors of tbe Ohio Farmer, con
tradicting a report that the paper had
been offered $10,000 by Mr. Hanna to sup
port McKinley. All charges of attempted
coercion bare been refuted wherever they
have been specifically made. There is no
THE. SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1896.
truth in any of these reports, mnd they
would have no effect were it not that the
closing days of the canvass have excited
the minds of credulous people to such an
extent that they are ready to believe
almost anything that is said against their
opponents, or against men whom they re
gard with envy or prejudice.
We regret to note that Mr. Bryan has
not been above the meanness of giving his
personal sanction to these canards. In
his speeches of Wednesday on his way
through Illinois he did not hesitate to ex
press a belief that employers are trying to
coerce their employes and that the Re
publican manapers are endeavoring to
bribe newspapers and tbe people to sup
port the Republican ticket.
At Hammond, 111., he said: "Instead
of resorting to argument some of the em
ployers have resorted to coercionâ that is,
they have attempted to make their em
ployes think as they want them to think."
At Logan:-port he said : "The Republican
managers' idea of circulation is to circu
late a large amount of money just before
the election in order to contract the cur
rency right after the electioa. * â¢ â¢ I
am afraid the chairman of the Republi
can National Committee is the forerunner
of the advance ageni of that peculiar form
of prosperity that comes just before an
election to those who expect to make
enough now to run them until the next
campaign."
When the Presidential candidate of the
fusion party makes statements of this
kind we may be sure the lesser orators
and ail the party organs will follow their
leader in full cry. Misrepresentation,
abuse, falsehood, slander and downright
lies will follow one another thick and fast
for the rest of the campaign. Intelligent
men must be on their guard against them.
It is not easy to head off a lie when once
it has been fairly started. The best way
is to forewarn the people that they may
be careful not to believe anything which
comes to them except upon trell-estab
lished authority.
Frllow-rit :/s:iÂ«i, which will yon put
in that scat, hallowed by Washing-ton
and Jefferson and Lincoln ? Which
man will you pat iir. the head of this
republic of laws which those great
men founded and saved? In whose
hands will this fairest fabric of gov
ernment ever raised up for mankind
be more safeâ in the hands of W. J.
Bryan or of William McKinley? Ac
cording: as you decide that question in
November you will decide the weal or
woe of this country for a generation to
come.â Hon. S. W. McCall.
SMOKING THEM OUT.
The Democratic party of California and
elsewhere appears to be occupied this
year in smoking its leaders out of their
bole.x. A few days ago it came to tbe at
tention of the reading public that the
New York Democrats were quite indus
triously engaged in smoking David B.
Hill out of the hole into which he had
withdrawn himself and apparently pulled
the hole in after him. The effort has not,
however, ap to this writing appeared to
have been much of a success, and the wily
David still remains in his hole.
In addition to the effort of the New
York Democrats there* has been going on
for some time a very persistent and not
altogether futilo effort to smoke the ad
ministration, including those who now
compose and in the past have composed
its Cabinets, out of its hole. Democracy
for some time waited with its hand to its
ear for a declaration from President Cleve
land as to liis attitude toward <he party
candidate and the platform upon which
he stands. Its patienco was finally re
warded, and the President^will not prob
ably be asked for another emergence until
the candidate and his platform are each
sadly in need of an obituary.
There have been a few other instances
where tbe smoking-out process has been
successful. For example, Secretary Wil
son was smoked out, and upon emerging
caused those who have been engaged in
the effort to regret their own success.
Mr. Wilson having given expression over
his own signature to the idea that
Mr. Bryan is an unsafe man to be
at the head of the Government and
that the outcome of effecting such
legislation as he recommends would
be a panic and resultant disaster
the like of wnich this country has never
yet suffered from, has retired into his
hole, very much to the relief of those who
smoked him out of it. It is more than
likely that others of the administration,
if they should be compelled to appear at
all between now and election day, will
cause the same feeling of relief to over
flow the Democratic soul when they retire
into the obscurity from which they have
reluctantly come.
The Democrats of California are also en
gaged in a smoking-out process. They
have, for instance, smoked out Billy
Foote, and if reports be true he has been
engaged in the main in forcibly expressing
his profound sense ot disgust at the very
name of Cator wherever he has gone. Up
to date, Mr. Foote is the only one of the
"0!e Bills" of the Democratic party who
has b?en smoked out of his hole, and it is
generally understood that if the rest of
that famous company should be smoked
out their language would bo even more
lurid than that which marked tbe appear
ance of Mr. Foote.
The latest leader who has been smoked
out of his hole by the persistent efforts of
the Democratic State Central Committee
is Governor Budd, who has been finally
persuaded to preside at a public meeting.
It may be that bis Excellency, the Gov
ernor, may deem it a duty and debt of
gratitude on his part to the people who
elected him to make an occasional ap
pearance during the remainder of the
campaign in the capacity of chairman of
j meetings at which other people occupy tbe
center of the stage. Those of us, however,
who are familiar with the Governor's
method of conducting a campaign when
j his heart is in it will hardly recognize
him in this perfunctory capacity, and will
1 be inclined to believe that although he
I ma 7 nave been smoked out of his bole, be
is either ciot thinking what be says, or not
saying what be thinks, regarding tbe
Democratic party as at present constituted
and its chances of success.
The Chicago platform la loaded with
dynamite. It declares for repudiation,
nullification and revolution. To pro
nounce 50 cents' worth of silver to be a
dollar and to make that a legal tender
for the payment of the public debt is
repudiation. To resolve not to enforce
the laws of Congress when resisted by
violence and Insurrection -without the
consent of the Governor of the State is
nullification. To reorganize the Su
preme Court so aÂ« to make it the regis
trar of the decrees of a political caucus
is revolution.â General B. F. Tracy.
THE PROPER REMEDY.
It is conceded by csen of all parties that
grave evils exist in this country. Tbe
Nation is without a revenue equal to its
necessary expenses, and the people are
without an industrial prosperity sufficient
to pive employment to labor and pro
vide workmen with the wages needful
for the comfort and maintenance of their
home?. Some remedy for these evils
must be provided. What remedy is to be
adopted forms the chief issue of the polit
ical compaign in which ; we are now en
gaged. -:; ; __,' _â¢â  ; : , v ' ,* â¢ >
;f The contrast between the. remedies pro
posed by the Republican party and 1 , those
of the fusion; of >; disordered elements
which is represented^ by Mr. Bryan was
well f stated by ex-President Harrison in j
his speech on Wednesday night at Cm- !
cinnati. Mr. Harrison pointed '' out J. that
the ) Republican - J party ' proposes I a â  well
ad justed, revenue-producing" protective
tariff and . the : maintenance of 'a . sound
financial system which shall keep at a
parity every dollar of money that cir- (
culates, whether .of gold, silver or paper.
The fusion party, on the 5 other hand,
offers no remedy save the rash experiment
of entering npon free silver coinage with
out the concurrence ;of other 3 nations.
They , propose no remedy for ', the defective
tariff, i suggest no means of raising a
revenue for the Government and offer no
Governmental protection to American in
dustry in order to provide for the employ
ment of the workingmen of the country.
The people have to choose between these
two , plans of 'â  remedying | existing | evils.
On the one ; side we are offered ' remedies
which have been tried and proven good
by experience. V Every one knows . that
under a protective tariff f the Government
had an ample revenue and the working
man, ample employment. ' On the other
side we have nothing but a hazardous ex
periment which, to say the least of it, is
founded more upon : rashness than upon
discretion. - '-; International bimetallism
would " undoubtedly be " for the benefit of
America, and this the Republican party is
pledged to promote ; but free silver carried
out by men like Mr. Bryan, without " ex
perience in ? statecraft :or even in the con
duct of private business, is almost certain
to result in overwhelming disaster.
In a choice such as this business men
and workingmen who have a fair sense of
their own interests can hardly hesitate.
It is better to adopt a rercedy which ex
perience has proved to be good than to re*
sort , to untried nostrums which are little
better ; than arrant quackery. The coun
try has mede one experiment of Demo
cratic rule. " It cannot afford to venture
upon another.- The prosperity of this
country depends upon the election of Mr.
McKinley. ____________ â  - r . '.â ''â â

FLOODED WITH SILVER
The Experience of Canada During the
Â»ar in the United State*.
The following extract from the Toronto
Leader was published in the financial
columns of the Alta Californian April 18,
1865:
It is well known that we were not troubled
with silver before the American war com
menced, but as soon as the paper currency of
the States became depreciated, and would not
pass in Canada, we began to find American
silver pouring into the country. Qold became
an object of speculation; every one knew it
must advance in price, and as a consequence
the Americans brought silver in large quan
tities Into this province, and after exchanging
it for bills drew goid irom the banks with
which to speculate in the New York markets.
American silver became abundant in Canada
at once. The banks soon found it necessary to
refuse to take silver from their customers at
par on deposit; this stopped to a great extent
the direct influx, and the banks have found it
necessary ever since to regulate the rate of
discount relatively to the abundance of silver
in the market.
The price of gold in New York continues
higher than the price of silver, the difference
being never less than 3 per cent and generally
much more, varying according to the demand
for gold from the importers. It therefore be
comes a matter of speculation with the Ameri
can dealer to buy silver in New York and pay
it out to us, as he realizes irom 3 to 5 percent
on the money alone in the transaction. This
circumstancekeeps up a constant but gradual
influx 01 silver into this country and accounts
for tbe large quantities in circulation here.
So long then as silver is taken at par by us,
and the above difference in the price of silver
and gola in the New York market continues,
the country will be flooded with silver.
NOT A STRAW VOTE.
Stockton Independent.
Tbe San Francisco Call has received from
170 commercial travelers from California cities
statements of their Presidential preferences.
Of these 144 are for McKinley and 2t> for
Bryan. Of those whose statements favoring
McKinley were printed half a score are Demo
crats, aad these tell why they prefer him. All
ba3e their preference on his soundness on the
money question and their ability to foresee
what disturbance if not disaster must follow
falling to the silver basis. Those who favor
Bryan do not give their reasons, except to say
they think free silver will help business. Why
they think so does not appear. These drum
mers also report the preferences of business
men in the Pacific Stales and the reports are
cheering, for nearly all oppose Bryan and free
coinage. Thib is not a mere straw vote. It is
a canvass of how people who think regard thÃ
campaign. Those who ao not think are all for
Bryan.
NOT SURPRISING.
Napa Register.
Five for McKinley to one for Bryan is the
way the commercial travelers of California
stand, as shown by the San Francisco Call's
poll of nearly 200 representative members of
the fraternity. This showing is not surpris
ing, for commercial travelers must have good
times to make their journeys profitable, and
times have not been good since Bryan's kind
of a tariff superseded the McKinley law.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
J. T. Taylor, an extensive stock-grower of
Kern County, whose ranch is near Bakersfleld,
is among the new arrivals at the Lick. Mr.
Taylor is a pioneer of that region of country
and has been a long time in the livestock
business. His specialty is growing horses and
he pays little attention to cattle and some
otber kinds of livestock.
"In the way of striking or startling news,"
said Mr. Taylor, "I do not know that I can
give you anything. But if you want a picture
of what exists down there I will try and tell
you in a few words. Business is not rushing;
it is what you might say rather quiet. There
is a little bit of movement in the cattle busi
ness, but as I am not in that line I don't know
much about it except that it gives an added
life to things.
â¢â¢I have for a good while devoted my atten
tion to the raising of horses. But horses, as I
suppose most people are aware, are not com
manding a big figure now. They are not sell
ing for so much as they ought to.
"There is one thing at Bakersfleld that is ex
citing considerable attention and a good deal
of comment, and that is the irettlng of electric
power from Kern River Canyon. This canyon
is sixteen miles from Bakersfield. There is a
very large fall of water there, and the idea is
to bring the power to the city and use it there
for starting a lot of industries, including fac
tories of different kinds. The power is to be
used, too, for other purposes, notably for pump
ing water, lighting and other things.
"We raise a good many sheep in Kern
County, but I do not think there are so many
now as there used to be. There was a time
when the French herders had sheep all over
the hills. They switched them about a good
deal and moved them from one side of the
country to the other. From the tops of the
mountains to the plains, from there to the
timber, asd so on."

"In what year was Mars so close to the earth?"
kindly furnished tne following answer: The
oppositions of Mars, i. c., when the planet is
nearest the earth, occur on an average every
780dayÂ«,but owing to the large eccentricity
of the orbit of Mars and the consequent varia
tions of the rate of his orbital motion the act
ual intervals between successive oppositions
of the planet are very unequal, reaching
about forty-five days. If an opposition occurs
about the end of March Mars will be very near
his perihelion and tbe least distance from the
earth, about 33,800,000 miles, If the earth
should be in aphelion. If the opposition occurs

Saturday Evening, October 10, 1896. **
HON. C. L. FELTON will Preside.
; M. B. FRANK MctAFGHMN; Chairman Republican State L'oinmitte*.
M. B. HIGGIMS, Secretary,
about the end of February Mars will be .n
aphelion, and if the earth should then be in
perihelion the distunce between the planets
would be about 63,300,000 miles and the op
position would.be the least favorable. The
favorable oppositions occur at intervals of nf
teen or seventeen years and fortunately for
observers Mars in opposition rises when the
sun sets and may thus be seen during the en
tire night.
One of the last two favorable oppositions was
on the sth of September, 1877, which was so
very favorable that Professor Asaph in his pre
meditated search discovered the two minute
satellites of Mars. Then followed the opposi
tion of Mars on tho 12th of November, 1879,
27th of December, 1881, February 1, 1884,
March 6,1880, April 11, 1888, May 27, 1890,
all unfavorable. On the 3d of August, 1892,
occurred the second very favoraDle opposition,
when observations were again made upon the
satellites, and especially upon the physical as
pects of the planet. At that opposition the
diameter of the planet was 26.8 seconds of arc.

No Gold for Silverâ a. H. c, Woodbrldgef'
San Joaquin County, Cal. The several ques
tions in your communication are covered by
the answer that the sub-treasury at San Fran

gold in exchange. At one time this was done
as a matter of convenience, but about the Ist
of August the officers were notified that silver
dollars must be exchanged only for silver cer
tificates.
LADY'S CAPE WITH TABS
Some of the handsomest of the new capes
are of velvet, covered with an all-over de-ign
of lace braids, or elaborately trimmed with
heavy white lace.
Others are braided, the braid being white,
black or a color matching or contrasting with
the cloth or velvet employed in making the
cape. A perfectly plain shape is used for thU
purpose, slightly rippling In effect. The loug
Cab ends are likewise very stylish, whether the
model be used for a plain or a very much
trimmed garment. The tabs hang straight
from the neck, uncouflned at the waist line,
being cut in one with the cape, or rather being
an extension of the cape below the waist
line. The home dressmaker may enter the
task of capemaking with a light heart, for the
process is very simple when this shape is used.
The lining and outside being cut exactly alike
they are simply sewed together in a seam and
urned right side out or the edges are turned
n and blind stitched together if velvet is used.

Wednesday. A stiff breeze was blowing
ani tbe schooner was making up for lost
time. Tne tug Redmond bad spoken sev
eral vessels in the offing, but failed to
secure a tow. Captain Shaw accordingly
headed for the Rattler, but doing her best
tbe Redmond could not catch the sealer.
Wing and wing the Rattler scudded before
the breeze, and Jogging thirteen knots
the tug could not get within hailing dis
tance.
When Captain Fred Nelson left here on
tbe Rattler he saw to it that all his seal
ine-boats had water-tight compartments.
I To this precaution three of the crew owe
their lives. On April 13, John Mohlman,
the hunter, aud a boatsteerer and boat
puller were out hunting. The sea was
I smooth as glass and sot a seal was in
sight. "It was about 2 o'clock in the
afternoon," said Moblman, describing the
occurrence, "when we saw a ripple on the
water ana immediately I got ready. A
second glance showed me that it was not
a seal and the boatpulier beaded away
I from it.
Tbe fish kept along in our direction and
it did not take me long to recognize it as a
killer. It made direct for the boat and
struck us amidsbip. Five of our planks
were stove in and the ribs were smnsh'ed
in all directions. The boat *Vas turned
over and over by tbe killer and we went
around with her. Finally when the fish
bad got through with its play I managed
to clamber into the wreck while the boat
steerer and boatpulier held on to tbe bow
and stern. For five hours we stayed with
the wreck and then Captain Nelson picked
us up. He became alarmed at our long
delay and sent a boat out to look for us.
Had it not been for the air-tight compart
ment in our boat not one of us would ever
have reached land. That killer was out
f. r a good time and we got the worst
of it."
Hunter Moblman says he has had
1 enough sealing.
The Pacific Mail Company's San Jose
and China sailed ior Panama and the
Orient yesterday. On the China the
Chinese made a disturbance prior to the
sailing of the vessel. One of the coolies
attempted to pet away without paying his
debts. His creditor caught him as he was
going up the ga&gpianlc and- trouble en
sued. During the right several friends
rushed in, and two of them( were pushed
overboard. Quite an exciting scene fol
lowed, biit the Chinese were rescued
nothing the worse for their ducking. The
debtor in the meantime boarded the
steamer and thus escaped his creditor.
The principal item on tbe San Jose was
389,286 pounds of beans, probably the
largest cargo of that articlo that has ever
left this port. Of it 245,682 pounds are in
transit for Boston.
Captain Wfshart of the Sierra Perima
has sailed for this port in command of the
Sierra Miranda. When the Sierra Parima
went ashore in the Indian Ocean it was
reported that all hands were lost. Later,
however, the captain and crew reached
England. When the Sierra Miranda ar
rived Captain McMasters was taken ashore
I and placed in a hospital, suffering from
I a native disease called "beri-beri," so
j Captaia Wishart was placed in command.
Captain "Clem" Randall will succeed
i Captain "Dan" Haskell as master of the
big tug Fearless next Monday. As a tow
boat man Captain Randall has not a
superior in California and as a navigator
he is the equal of any man sailing out of
San Francisco- The Fearless will do good
wort fn bis hands, and Captain Haskell is
satisfied that be has a worthy successor.
Captain John Silovich will succeed Gap
tain Randall on the Vigilant. For years
he has been one of the most vaiued men
in the Spreckels' employ, and his promo
tion to tbe mastership of the second best
vessel in the service is a well-deserved one.
Captain "Gil" Brokaw, the genial and
popular master ot the Alert, will take ihe
Reliance, and Captain "Joe" Trewren, the
well-known mate of the Fearless and for
merly of the Relief, will go as master of
the Alert.
Jimmy Rennett and Dave Crowley Jr..
runners for the Golden Shore Market, had
a narrow escape yesterday. They were
eoing out to sea to look for incoming
ships and took a tow from the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's Corona. Off
Fort Point their boat eot under the stern
of the steamer and a hole was stove in her
bow. They cut adrift and taking off
their coats and vests stuffed them in the
hole. Then they got aft in orier to raise
the bow out.of the water and finally pad
dled the boat to North Beach, where they
ran her ashore. It only took them ten
minutes to secure another boat and pro
ceed 10 sea again under sail.
The Egremont Castle got in on Septem
ber 27 last and lost her anchor off Meiggs
wharf. The tug Sea Witch attempted to
recover it but iailed. Yesterday the
wrecking schooner Jessie Madsen was sent
out and she picked up the missing hook
and chain in about an hour.
The schooner Bender Brothers got in
yesterday after a stormy .voyage. During
a gale she lost her foresail and other minor
damages were incurred.

A FORTUNE FOR
A FARMER'S WIFE
Kansas City Property May
Go to a Napa County
Woman.
A Strange Turn of Affairs in
an Old Lawsuit Reads
Like Romance.
WILD LAND BECOMES VALUABLE
The California Woman's Rights Are
Probably Saved by an Old Com
mon Law Statute.
There is a prospect that Mrs. Mary Jes
sen of St. Helena, Napa County, may re
cover nearly $300,000 of property now in
litigation in tbe courts of Kansas
City. Mo.
Attorney Charles Clarke of Inde
pendence, Mo., who represents the pres
ent owners of tho property, was in San
Francisco a few days ago looking up evi
dence, and from him the story of the
struggle was obtained.
"There are many interesting points in
tbe case," said the Missouri attorney a
few days ago, "and the litigation through
out is unique. In 1858 Albert Hahn of St.
Joseph, Mo., owned 100 acres in Jackson
County. He died at sea, the widow did
not survive him long, and the children,
of whom Mrs. Jessen was one, were left
helpless minors. By a strange proceed
ing of the law the Public Administrator
of Buchanan County, where the children
lived, advertised ti;e Jackson County
property for sale to pay the dead man's
debts, and it was sold.
"Time went on. and after three decades
Kansas City took on a phenomenal growth.
During the boom the suburbs grew almost
to the property that the dead man had
owned, greatly enhancing its value, so
that what had originally been a poor,
pebbly farm became valuable as a place
for homes. It was then that some shrewd
lawyer, examining the abstract, fell upon
the point tuat the present litigation de
pends upon.
"Mrs. .lessen was laboring tinder two
legal disabilities at the time her property
was sold, to she was not properly deprived
of her interest in the land. She was an
infant in law ami a married woman, and
under the Missouri laws property could
not be taken from persons laboring under
such legal disabilities. Mrs. Jesser.'s dis
ability of infancy of course expired, but
she still labored under the impediment of
marriage, so the statute of limitations did
not run.
"Under the same old common law
rule tbe husband bad the marital right of
possession to his wife's property, but as
he did not assert it she now seeks to re
cover."
The case has been pending in the Mis
souri courts for some months, but it will
soon come to trial, and there is a fair pros
pect that Mrs. Jessen will win.
Since tbe death of the original owner of
the property the land that was almost a
barren waste has greatly enhanced in
value, and is to-day worth $300,000 to $400,
--000. If the case goes in her favor the
humbie farmer's wife of Napa County will
be richer than she ever believed in her
fondest dreams.
LILLIAN ASHLEY'S SUIT.
Arguments ia the Case Against K. J.
Baldwin Are Being Heard.
Arguments in the suit of Lillian A.
Ashley against E. J. Ba.'dwin, tho mil
lionaire horseman, for $75,0U0 damages for
seduction, were beard by Judge Slack
yesterday.
James L. Crittenden, representing Miss
Ashley, opened the argument. He went
ovar the life story of his client, finally
coming to her acquaintance with Baldwin
and her visit to California at his invita
tion. Mr. Crittenden spoke of how the
plaintiff bad gone to the Baldwin Hotel
and wiiile there, the personal guest of and
accepting the hospitality ol its proprietor,
had been ruined by him.
Mr. Crittenden turned his attention to
the witnesses for the defense and severely
scored several of them, but most of all
John Osborn, the Oregon farmer, who tes
tified to having been intimate with Miss
Ashley.
Reuben H. Lloyd, for the defense, went
over the entire nauseous testimony of the
suit, first warning the two women present
that bis argument was not going to be
tenderly phrased. He defended Osborn's
actions.
After Mr. Lloyd has finished Attorney
Highton will hold the floor and then Mr.
Crittenden will mate the closing argu
ment, which may be completed to-dsy.

PLOT THAT FAILED.
The Three Burglars In Their Attempt
to Break From the Prison Con
templated Murder.
Josephine Kelly, wife of Patrick Kelly,
one of the trio of burglars who planned to
escape from the City Prison during the
police parade yesterday, appeared before
Judge Conlan yesterday morning to
answer the charceof passing opium to her
husband. She pleaded not guilty and her
case was continued.
Captain Robinson had another talk with
Kelly yesterday and learned more details
of the plot. A revolver was to have been
smuggled Into the prison Wednesday
night and Doorkeeper Shaw's life would
have been sacrificed if necessary to enable
them to escape.
Only one of the three burglars was al
lowed out of tbe cell at a time, to that the
plan of friends calling within a few min
utes of each other to ask for an interview
with each of the prisoners would not have
worked. It is believed that the real plan
was that when the friend called to see
Kelly and Shaw opened the door of tbe
cell he would have been shot down and
tbe three burglars, Kelly, Corbett and
Colvin, would have made a break for the
door and opened it with the false key.
Captain Robinson has also learned that
one of the "trusties" was au accomplice in
the scheme and this probably accounts for
(the accuracy in the making of the false
key, as the "trunty" might have got a
chance unobserved to make an impression
of the door key with a piece of soap.
NOMINEES WANTED.
The Citizens' Committee of Safety Will
Select Candidates for Indorsement.
The citizens' committee of safety met
Wednesday at 821 Webster street to select

mence first with the candidates for Jus
tices of the Peace. Property-holders and
taxpayers are asked to send tbe names of
candidates for Supervisors and School
Direc tors, with tbe senders' names at
tached to the lists.
FRANCHISE ARGUMENTS.
Why the Supervisors Should Not
Sell the Mutual Telephone
Privilege.
Judge Murphy Inclined to Think Ha
Has No Right to Interfere In
the Matter.
Judge Murphy heard arguments yester
day as to the writ of prohibition prayed
for by George G. Gould to restrain the
Board of Supervisors from selling the Peo
ple's Mutual Telephone franchise.
General Friedrich and Assistant City
and County Attorney Brobeck, who repre
tented the Supervisors, claim that the
board is acting no t only legislatively but
ministerially in tbe matter. and that in
consequence Irft Superior courts have no
power to interfere. Attorney George
Levmsky, in behalf of the petitioner,
grants that the board is acting legisla
tively, except where the condition that
only telephone companies possessing 2000
subscribers could be grantees oi the
franchise is imposed. He claims that the
making of this condition resolves the
board into a judicial body and so subject
to a writ of prohibition.
Judge Murphy, in the course of the
argument, remarked- that the acts of the
Supervisors up to the time bids were
opened and considered are distinctively
legislative and as such without his juris
diction and that no matter what condi
tions are imposed in granting the fran
chise hi would have no power to restrain
them.
"I think." said his Honor, "that this
action has been brought prematurely."
Argument will be continued to-day.
Chinese Out and White Men In.
About forty-five Chinese who have been
washing the various railings and glass in the
upper corridors and elsewhere in the Palace
Hotel have struck. There was a story in cir
culation that the boss of the Chinese was re
ceiving a rake-off of from $2 50 to $5 a month
ot their wages, and that this was the reason of
the strike. Manager Kirkpatriek denies this,
and says the reason is that the boss has been
querulous and hard to get along with, that he
was therefore discharged, and the other Chi
nese followed. About the same number of
white men have been added to tbe force since
the evacuation of the Mongolians. â¢

DEMOCRATS HELD

The Stanislaus Democratic
County Ticket Cannot
Be Filed.
Period Allotted Two Days Short
of the Time Required by
Law.
SUPREME COURT DECIDES.
To Grant the Writ of Mandate Asked
For Won d Be to Disregard
the Law.
The Stanislaus County Democratic
ticket was not presented to County Clerk
Dingley of Stanislaus in time for filing.
Tii is is tho decision reached by the
Supreme Court yesterday. The Demo
cratic nominees affected are the candidate
for Superior Judge and the nominees for
Board of Supervisors. The decision will
make it necessary for these nominees to
get their names on the ticket by petition.
The application for a writ of mandate to
compel County Clerk Dingley to fill the
belated list was argued Wednesday after
noon. John Â£. Richards appeared in op
position to the application. The text of
the decision was as fellows:
The respondent is tne County Clerk of Stan
islaus County, and on the sth day ot October,
1896, the petitioner presented to him for filing
a certificate duly authenticated by the proper
officers of the nomination by the County Con
vention of the Democratic party of tliat coun
ty, neld September 7, 1896, of certain candi
dates for public offices to be filled by the elec
tors of that county at the coming general elec
tion. The respondent refused to file the same,
alleging as a reason therefor that the day was
a holiday, and also because the same was not
presented for filing within the time required
by law. Tbe petitioner again presented the
certificate, to him on the 6th day of October
with the request that it be filed, but the re
spondent-again refused to file the same ior the
reason thai it was not presented to him for
filing within the time required by law. The
present application is for a writ of mandate
commanding the respondent to receive and
file said certificate.
Section 1192 of the Political Code, as amend
ed in 1895 (statutes of 1895, p. 303), provides:
Certificates of nomination required to be filed
with the County Clerks, or with the clerk or
secretary of the legislative body of any city or
town, shall be filed not more than fifty nor
less than thirty days belore tbe day of elec
tion, when the nomination is made by con
vention.
It is contended by the petitioners that
under this provision the 4th day of October
was tbe last day on which the certificate
could be filed, but that, as that day was Sun
day, by virtue of sections 12 and 13 of the
Political Code he was entitled to file it on the
next day that was not a holiday, and as the
sth day of OctoDer was a legal holiday his
p resen tation of the certificate to the respond
ent on the 6th was in time, and that the re
spondent should have filed it.
We are oi the, opinion, however, that these
provisions of the Political Code are inapplica
ble. Section 12 provides that a holiday shall
be excluded wiien it is the last day of time in
which any act provided by law is to be done:
and section 13 refers to an act which is ap
pointed to be done upon a particular day. la
the present case, however, tbe statute does not
fix the day upon which nor the time within
which the certificate is to be filed, but declares
that it shall be filed not less than thirty days
â before the day of election. To hold that it
c ould be filed twenty -eight days before the day
of election would be in manifest disregard of
the provisions of the statute. The application
for a writ is denied.

TIDINGS FROM
PEAK TO PEAK
Mount St. Helena Talks by
Flashlight to Mount
Diablo.
The Message Transmitted From
th 9 Last Place to Mount
Hamilton.
SUCCESS OF THE HELIOGRAPH.
How the Signal Corps Accomplished
the Feat of Speaking 66.3
Miles Away.
When in the early part of this year word
was received from Los Angeles that the
Signal Corps attached to the First Bri
gade bad succeeded in sending a message
by heliograph from Catallna Peak to Wil
son Peak, a distance of 61.91 miles, and
heralding the achievement as a record
breaking event, great interest was mani
fested by the local bignai Corps, and the
spirit of friendly rivalry long existing be
tween the two organizations was fanned
into a brisk and lively blaze, to the end
that men were detailed, routes laid out,
maps drawn and expeditions organized
and equipped, and, through the kindly
interference of Messrs. Haramon and Mc-
Adie fairly good weather was arranged
for, and last Monday the Signal Corps of
the Second Brigade signaled from Mount
St. Helena to Mount Diablo, a distance of
66.3 miles, keeping up communication for
some time and establishing a record that
beats by five miles the one Los Angeles is
so proud of.
All the squads left this City early Fri
day morning, the St. Helena squad, con
sisting of Corporals Everett and Hewes,
proceeding by rail to Calistoga, whence
by aid of their feet and a packhorse they
reached the summit.
The Mount Diablo squad under com
mand of Major Charles J. Evans and con
sisting of Serjeant Garfield, privates Jars
and Delamatcr proceeded from Oakland
by wagon and camping over night on the
mountainside reached their station Satur
day morning, when communication was
opened with Mount Hamilton, where
Lieutenant Perkins, Corporal Jura and
Private Harkness were stationed.
Telegraph Hill was made an interme
diate station, and there Sergeant Ells
worth with a detail of men was kept busy
answering questions as to the weather and
the state of the goat marKet.
The original long-distance |record was
established in 1895 by the San Francisco
and Sacramento signal corps over an air
line from Mount Diablo to Sacramento, a
distance of 52.6 miles. The line between
Mount Diablo and Telegraph Hill is one
often used by the corps Jor practice, al
though at times with indifferent success,
owing to unfavorable climatic conditions,
the slightest haze so obscuring tne helio
graph flash as to render it almost in
yisi ble.
Each squad was supplied with the
necessary topographical maps, and all
lines were laid out by compass, the vari
ation between the true north and the
magnetic north being determined and due
allowance made therefor.
Considerable information was secured
which will be of great benefit to the corps
in its future work. And notes were made
on all stations as to conditions â atmos
pheric and climatic.
Professor Davidson, formerly chief of
the United States Coast and Geodetic Sur
vey, furnished the corps with all needed
information, and expressed himself as
highly satisfied with the result, as did
also Major Evans.
The record now stands at 66.3 miles, and
the corps deserves to be complimented on
its efficiency.
WANT A NEW SYSTEM
Plan to Introduce the Proportional
Method of Voting in the
Olympic Club.
There is a movement on foot in the
Olympic Club to introduce tbe propor
tional system of voting instead of the
cumbersome method now in vogue. There
has been a great falling off in the mem
bership within tbe last two years, and a
number of the members claim to have
fonnd one of the causes for this defection
in the antiquated system under which the
directors are now elected.
Under the present method 51 per cent
of the voting members can elect the \vkole
board, leaving 49 per cent unrepresented.
This has happened on many occasions.
The members of the unrepresented mi
nority finding opposition useless, quietly
drop out one by one, and recommend
their friends to do the same.
"Under a proportional and preferential
system not 51 but 98 per cent of those
voting could be represented," said one of
the leading advocates of the system. "To
illustrate: Suppose 1100 ballots to be cast
for eleven directors. Suppose there are
twenty candidates. These ate arranged
on the ballot in alphabetical order. The
roter expresses bis choice by writing the
figure 1 opposite his first choice, 2 oppo
site his second, and so on up to eleven.
When the voting is over the ballots are
thoroughly mixed in the ballot-box, then
drawn out one by one and distributed on
files in the order of first choice. When
all the ballots are filed the tally clerbs re
rort the whole number of good votes cast.
This divided by the number of candidates

"It will go
away after awhile."
That's what people say when
advised to take something to
cure that cough.

to be elected, in tdis case 1100 by 11, gives
100 as the quota. Any candidate having
this number or more "is declared elected
and his quota of ballots is removed from
the file to be sealed up. His surplus bal
lot?, if any, are then distributed in the
order of second choice. Then those hav
ing so few votes a3 to have no show of
election are distributed, till by successive
distribution and elimination the whole
number of candidates is reduced to the
number to be elected.
"In this way each voter's choice is
respected, and even if hi 3 first choice be
not elected his second, third or some other
will be. In this way any hundred voters
in the above illustration cau elect a direc
tor instead of requiring 551, as they would
now.
"This process is simpler and quicker
than the present system besides being
absolutely just and mathematically accur
ate. This is no mere theory, being practi
cally demonstrated in the annual elections
of tne Mechanics' Institute, the University
Club, the Customs Civil Service Associa
tion and other societies In this City. The
Mechanics' Institute has steadily in*
creased its membership and prosperity
since adopting this system.
"The board of directors of the" Olympic
Club are mainly good men, but they do
not and cannot properly represent the
club."
An amendment to the constitution of
the club providing for this system has
been prepared and a petition is being cir
culated among the members asking that
it be made part of the organic law of the
association. Already a number of the
members are interested in tne plan and
they hope to succeed in introducing it at
the next campaign.

GOLD DEMOCRATS
ON THE TICKET
Bryan Democrats Were Not
Able to Shut Them
Out.
Effect ot a Decision Rendered
Yesterday in the Supreme
Court.
ARE "NATIONAL DEMOCBATS."
The Supreme Judges Find This Title,
Adopted at Indianapolis, Is
Not Deceptive.
The State Central Committee of the
Bryanite Democracy failed yesterday to
shut out the National Democracy, other
wise known as the "Gold Democrats,"
from a place on the ticket under an ap
propriate designation. The Supreme Court
decided that the gold Democrats are en
titled to designate their electors as the
candidates of the National Democracy.
The gold Democrats, learning what was in
the wind, rallied in considerable force and
put up strong arguments, which were
found to be correct by tne majority of the
Supreme Court, sitting in bank.
The court proceedings, which took place
yesterday afternoon, were far from being
devoid of general public interest. The
gold Democrats sent up a delegation of
attorneys, who sat in a block on one side
of the courtroom. The representatives of
the Bryan Democracy sat together, and
there was quite a collection of interested
observers, mainly political. The proceed
ings had not advanced far, when Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald, who appeared in
bebaif of the Secretary of State, had a few
whispered words with Mi. McEnerney.
Then he rose and said that the
part of the application which he was pre
pared to argue would not be urged, so he
had nothing to argue.
This left the only issue before the Su
preme Court a straight-out light between
the two wings of the Democratic party,
the National Democracy and the Bryanite
Democracy.
Justices Henshaw, Harrison, Van Vleet
and Temple signed the following opinion,
which was rendered by Justice Henshaw:
We are of the opinion that the application
lor a writ of mandate should be denied, hold
ing that the designation "National Demo
cratic" is not calcinated to deceive.
Justice McFarland concurred and de
livered the following opinion:
I concur in the judgment; but 1 also think
that the question, under the peculiar form
which this position for a writ takes, was de^r
mined by the Secretary of State when tiAc
ct'pted and filed tbe certificate, and thatTiis
aciion cannot be reviewed on this proceeding.
The dissenting Justices were Justice
Garroutte and Chief Justice Beatty. Tne
former pimply wrote, "I dissent." Chief
Justice Beatty wrote:
I cannot distinguish thi? case from the Dolan
and Ewing cases, in which we held that can
didates nominated by petition are not entitled
to v party designation, which' might mislead
voters.
When the decision was received, which
was late in tbe afternoon, tbe telephone
was kept busy ringing up those who had
expressed a desire to be notilied at once.
â¢'A designation was forced upon us,"
said Edward R. Taylor, speaking for the
gold Demociat.-, "by the Chicago conven
tion. We took up a name by which the
Democratic party has been known for
many years past. We are the Democratic
party. We had to take some name and we
are entitled to this."
Robert x*. Hayne said for tbe gold Demo
crats: "If our party choose to take the
name of Democrat it does not lie with the
court to say that Democrat means one par
ticular thin?. Tbe court can only inter
fere if deception is possible."
Garret McEnerney made the only argu
ment for the Bryan Democratic State Cen
tral Committee. He said that the desig
nation of National Democratic party on
the ticket would tend to deceive voters.
The Democratic (Bryan) party is the real
National party, but does not use the name
"National" because it is unnecessary. But
the omission of National from the ljemo
cratic designation did not entitle any other
party to use tne National Democratic
title. In a copyright case this would be
an infringement. Voters can be deluded
by the use of this designation.
The dropping of tbe application for one
designation will result in the Democratic
(Bryan) and Populist electors being named
twice on the ticket, according to Attorney-
General's Fitzgerald's view of the case,
once under the heading of "Democratic
Electors" and again under the heading of
"People's Party Electors."
BANKS OF CALIFORNIA,
Report of the Commissioners to
the Governor of the
State. *
An Actual Loss of More Than Fonr
Millions of Cash in Thirteen
Months.
Paris Kilburn, J. B. Fuller and H. W.
Magee, Bank Commissioners of California,
have forwarded to Governor Budd the
eighteenth report of the commission. The
number of banks in the State is 303.
Total money in banks of California, in
cluding National banks, $21,775,362 60;
total assets, $303,860,772 23; total amount
due depositors, $202,663,603 34. The num
ber of commercial banks actively conduct
ing a banking business is 174. The incor
porated State savings banks number fifty
seven.
From an examination of the aggregate
resources of the commercial banks, as
shown by their reports of June 17, 1895, as
compared with the report of July 31, 1896,
it will appear that there bas been a loss of
$8,093,008 90 in resources during the year.
The amount of cash on hand June 17,
1895, was $19,053.248 42, and on July 31,
1896. $14,654,182 82, showing a loss in cash
during a period of thirteen months of
$4,399,065 60. This large reduction, says
the report, "is accounted for in some
measure by the withdrawal from commer
cial use of $2,575,607 15 of county or public
money, and also by the distrust and con
sequent withdrawal of gold caused by the
financial agitation incident to the near
approach of the Presidential election."
The savings banks have not lost a con
siderable amount. The number of depos
itors in San Francisco savings banks is
128.484; in interior savings ban Ks, 31,372;
total number. 159.856, making an average
deposit of $823 57. The deposits in sav
ings banks on July 31, 1896, amounted t3
$131,633,634.
The Commissioners recommend some
revision of the laws. It is their opinion
that tbe merging of savings and commer
cial hanks should be prohibited. Tbe
law should be amended providing that
when a bank is declared insolvent a re
ceiver should bo appointed by the court to
take charge of the affairs of the bank
while it is in litigation, with 'the power
placed in the commission to fix the salary
of the receiver.
It is also recommended that loans made
to officers and directors of commercial
banks should be approved by at least three
member^ of the uoard of directors, who
are not directly or indirectly interested in
said loans; and that said approval should
be indorsed uj on the note or obligation
executed by the bank.
It is recommended further that the re
ports of the president and secretary of a
bank shall be revised by the directors.
MRS. MARCEAU SUED
Shreve ami Company Want Payment
for SHOO Worth of
Goods. .
Shreve & Co., jewelers, filed suit yester
day against Mrs. Amanda J. Marceau for
$1087 95 for goods sold and money loaned
during the past year or so to the former
wife of Theodore C. Marceau.
The creditors' attorneys, Fox <k Gray,
were busy late yesterday afternoon trying
to learn from Fresno just what real prop
erty Mrs. Marceau possesses in that
county and how heavily it is mortgaged,
for they wish to per a lien on something.
Soon after the divorce was granted Mr.
Marceau brought suit against his former
wife for $75,000. which he claimed to have
loaned ber at different times on her
Fresno property. Yesterday that sun,
was dismissed at the request of the plain
tiff, who it is understood ajrreed to a com
promise on a cash settlement for $40,000.
That amount Mrs. Marceau purposes to
raise by mortgaging her Fresno property.
Mr. Short of Fresno, Mrs. Marceau' s
lawyer, was here yesterday to arrange for
the transfer of the $40,000, a local building
and loan association having agreed, it is
paid, to advance that amount on the
Fresno real estate.
HUTCHINSGN'S CRUELTY
Terrible Manner in Which Two
Little Girls Were Mal
treated.
A Father Who Beat His Children With
a Poker and Drove Them
From Home.
. Jennie C. Burnett, guardian ad lit em of
Helen E. and Catherine Hutchinson, the
15-year-old twin daughters of Joseph W.
Hutchinson, yesterday brought suit
against the father to compel him to sup
port his offspring, and also asked for an
order of court giving the plaintiff com
plete control of the two iittie girls.
Hutchinson is the man who, in April
last, treated his motherless children so
cruelly that they ran away from home
and for nine days lived beneath the front
steps of a vacant house on Mission street.
They were discov ered by the police and
taken to the City Prison. During the
period of their residence beneath tbe steps
the little outcasts lived on such things as
they could get on their father's credit at
the grocery at which he traded. They ob
tained sardines, bread, eggs and a few
other articles, cooking what they could in
a tin can over the flame of a candle.
When the children were i arrested Hutch
inson visited them and bid them good-by,
saying he would leave them in charge of
the police authorities. Tliey were subse
quently sent to the "Hill Home," and
trom there transferred to the residence of
their present guardian, to whom Hutchin
son agreed to pay $25 a month for their
support.
Recently the parent has refused to pay
the $25 and applied for the custody of the
children, sayine he intended to put them
in the Magdalen Asylum. Mrs. Burnett
says that they are mild-mannered, well
behaved and gentle children, and that it
would be an outrage to confine them in a
home for fallen women. She also says she
is afraid that ii Hutchinsou secures con
trol of the girls he will again resort to the
brutal treatment which first drove them
irom home. He was accustomed to curse
them and beat them with whatever instru
ment came first to his hand. Among
other articles the weight of which the
children felt are a strop, an iron poker and
au iron hammer.
PHRENOLOGY EXPLODED.
JMeets Its Death at the Hands of Scien
tific Men.
The subject of phrenology has, for a
number of years, been discussed in all
parts of the country. It has had a num
ber of advocates who believed that it was
a science, or who pretended to believe that
it was a science. As a consequence, some
of tbe people who were induced to make a
study of the subject in a greater or lesser
degree, believed some of the demonstra
tions, while others, too intelligent to be
deceived by charlatanism, unhesitatingly
pronounced the alleged science a fraud.
The force of the phrenological wave has
now been broken because tbe leading
scientific writers, journalists and popular
authors, not alone of this country, but of
the entire civilized world have now prac
tically come to the conclusion that the
study is a delusion and a snare. As a con
sequence in every advanced circle these
men are dealing death blows to the deceit
as will appear from the varied and lucid
extracts on the subject which are here
appended:
"A person exercises a justifiable and
even a philosophical degree of caution in
withholding his assent from phrenology."
Penny Cyclopedia, London, 1840, vol.
XVIII, page 120.
"Phrenology is almost played out." â
Public Opinion, Dunedin, New Zealand,
June 4, 1881.
"That phrenology has arrived or is
likely to arrive at tbe dignity of a science
is denied or doubted by the best physiolo
gists." â Cassell's Concise Cyclopedia, Lon
don, 1883.
"Phrenology * * â¢ was wrong in its
theory, wrong in its facts, wrong in its in
terpretations of mental processes, ana
never led to the slightest practical re
sults."âPopular Science Monthly, New
York, October, 1889.
"The exploded science of phrenology." â
Dr. Manouvier, anthropologist and French
scientist, in the Scientific American Sup

was, in the main, a mess of error." â

day who viewed their military evolutions
can be accepted as a criterion, San Fran
cisco must feel she has reason to be proud
of them. The event was the first of what
is to be annual parades.
They presented an imposing and mag
nificent appearance. There were 390 plain
policemen in line, forming the fifteen
companies of the department. Two offi
cers, a sergeant and corporal were also
afoot with each company, and five cap
tains were either mounted or afoot. Aside
from these there were a dozen mounted
officers, making in all about 450 pol cemen
in full regalia, bright, clean and active, in
the parade.
All along the line of march, from Spear
and Market streets to and along Van Ness
avenue, the sidewalks were aimost im
passable, so crowded were they with peo
ple, who did not hesitate to give vent to
their admiration by prolonged cheers.
The Police Commissioners, Alvord,
T obin and Gunst, who were near the head
of the procession and who reviewed me
men, were more than gratified at their
showing and, through Chief Crowley, they
so expressed themselves to Captain Witt
man's command In Assembly' Hall after
tbe parade.
"Men," said ihe Chief, "I want to say
in benaif of the Police Commissioners and
myseif that we are all well pleased with
the work you have performed to-day. In
fact I know that if ever the time comes
when we may be called upon yon will be
able to acquit yourselves well of the duty
you are expected to rill, nnd men who are
drilled are a thousand per cent better pre
pared for joint action."
Captain Wittman then called upon his
men to give three cheers for their Chief,
and the cheers came with a will.
,At 1:30 o'clock everything was in readi
ness in the neighborhood of Market and
Spear streets, and tbe order to march was
given promptly at 2 p. m., the time sched
uled.
The First Battalion was headed by Ser
geant J. W. Moftitt, in command of the
six patrol wagons. These were decorated
as prettily as severe police ethics would
permit.
The "hurry wagons" were manned as
follows:
California street, Frank J. Murphy driver
and Officer John Morgan; Folsom-street sta
tion, Harry Carlsen driver and Oflicer Tom
Judson; Seventeenth-streetstation, James Cot

two wagons, U. Wnifht and Charles "Tryon
drivers and Officers John Connelly and Wil

Corporal M. Shanaghan was in com
mand of a dozen mounted officers and
preceded Chief Patrick Crowley astride his
magnificent black charger and in the
| beautiful saddle presented to him in fie
| morning as a token ol esteeÂ«n by Captain
Wittman. With the Chief was Captain
Marshall, the drill master, to whom is due
t! c credit of having'taught the depart

so cleverly.

When marching in platoons, the officer
in charge of the company took the first

On the parade grounds, extending from
Manet street to Golden Gate avenue, on
Van Ness, Captain Robinson of the Cen
tral station assumed chargeof the mounted
force and held back the throng.
The military evolutions were unham

HOW CRUEL TURKS
KILL ARMENIANS
A Pen Picture of Scenes of
Murder and Deso
lation.
Another Pathetic Letter From
the Heart of the Moslem
Kingdom.
TRADE STOP', MURDER REIGNS
Relatives in tbe Sultan's Benighted
Land Send a P teons Appeal to
Their C us.n Here.
A letter has reached San Francisco from
the heart of the Armenian massacres, an
appeal from the terror-stricken there to
their relative in this City, asking him to
send them money forthwith to enable
them to hasten to this asylum of the op
pressed.
The gentleman who received the letter
dare not give his name, for it would get
him in trouble with the Turkish authori
ties, through rhe Consul here.
The letter, however, gives a vivid idea
of the horrors to which Christians are sub
jected and suggests the extent of the
heartless murders there raging by royal
command.
It is the fear of the addressee of the let
ter and of others who know a great deal
of Turkish affairs that the scheme of the
Turks is to raise the green flag, called
"Sanjack She'eiff" â which means "the
holy banner" â and when that is raised
no Christian is spared, no quarter is given,
and all in sight are killed without hesita
tion.
The letter received is as follows:
Constantinople, August 29, 1896.
My Dear C\usin: On the 26th of this month,
while I was working in our printing-house, 1
heard some loud reports from the neighbor
hood of Galata. We at once quit our work and
ran to the windows and we noticed that all the
stores on our streets were closed. Just a little
while after that I saw carloads of wounded
and dead coming from the direction of Galata.
They were of all nations, but most of them
were Armenians. At this time there were re
] orts of roaring guns and this lasted until 10
'/clock in the evening. The Kurds and Softas
of our street were all on loot with the tradi
tional batons in their hands. With this terror
we heard that the Armenians had surrounded
the Ottoman Bank. We were so terrified that
I could not come out until half-past 10 in the
night.
Then joining with some comrades we took
the train from Sirkadii and went home. At
home l found your mother and sisters pale and
sick through fear, because they had heard all
the reports. We passed that night in great
fear, because all the Turks were very excited,
but, thank God, we have 'not been molested
yet.
On Thursday morning we did not work, be
cause all the stores and shops were closed.
The Police Commissioners as They Viewed the Parade.
All through the night previous wounded and
dead were brought over to this side of Pera.
We kept hungry until 9 o'clock in the morn
ing, because all the stores were closed. That
morning some rough Turks at Samatia Killed
thirty Armenians and a few women.
The Christians resisted them for a few hours,
but after their cartridges were exhausted they
surrendered themselves. Thereupon the Kurds
attacked their houses, pll'aglng them, and any
Armenian that they noticel in the street they
murdered at once. On Thursday morning af
5 o'clock we again heard those reports louder
than yesterday, and this lasted until half-past
6 continually. The dead and wounded were
brought over with express and monhajir
wagons. At 9 o'clock I went out with great
fear in my breast, because it was a very crit
ical moment to get out, and when I went home
I found all the ladies locked up in a room and
crying bitteriy.
Great silence dominated every street, and
this was a sign of a great danger. All the
lights were put out in the houses, and we were
watching through the windows, afraid some
Kurds or Turks would come In and murder us. '
A few times jus' a slight sound of the fall of a
stone or a plank would terrify us. At last
morning came and found us half awake.
On Friday morning I did not go out, but
from our neighbors I heard that on Thursday,
from two until half- past one in the night,
Kurds had attacked ail the principal commer
cial houses, which belong mostly to Armen
ians, on the streets of Tchakmokeljilar and
Frijaujllar, and after sacking the places they
murdered some of the prominent citizen*.
They also attacked the Christian population
of Kosskeag and Salmatousrouk, mid after
pillagine all the houses they committed such
torturous murders before the eyes ol a few
Europeans lhat the foreign embassies were
notified at once. My pen cannot describe ail
the cries and groans of the Armenian mothers
seeing their husbands and brothers butchered
with such cold blood as a brutal soldier might
use in killing his enemy on the BattW-fiaid.
And this was stopped about 2 o'clock on Thurs
da An ni -ilnve" was published late on Friday
night, that any one who commits murder will
be hanged.
To-day is Saturday. Still all the stores
and shops are closed. I am writing you
this letter intending to post it this afternoon
If God spares me from the sword of the Turk.
To-morrow is the 'feast of St. Mary, and the
same night there is a "donnanma. 1 I don t
know whether or not the stores will be open
on Tuesday. We are not killed yet, bm I ask
you in the name of Sod don't lose time to
send for your mother and two sisters. They
send you tneir locks of bair as a last token of
their love, became we expect a greater mas
sacr^ yet. Don't forget you must get your
people near you If you want them safe. Good
by, thia time that much will be enough.
It is a beautiful custom prevailing
among the Armenians and native Chris
tians of Turkey for relatives who feel that
they are nearinp the shadow of the valley
of death to send their distant relatives
locks of their hair to keep- like little im
mortelles as a suggestion of the meeting
again. In view of this fact the reference
in the letter becomes significant and beau
tiful, and altogether it is a pathetic picture
of the horrors of life among the cruel
butchers of u-nspenkable Turkey.

Democratic Committee Denounced.
Speakers Warmly Commend " The
Call's" Editorial.
Several delegations of Grand Army men
visited The Call office yesterday to ex
press hearty gratiiication on account of
an editorial article which appeared in
these columns rebuking certain Demo
cratic newspapers and campaign stump
Bpeakers for wanton and unjustifiable at
tacks on memuers of the Grand Army of
the Republic because they have seen fit to
exercise the right of free citizenship and
support the man of their choice for the
Presidency; a man who, like themselves,
saw service during the dart days of the
late unfortunate civil strife.
The article in question covers the ground
bo fully and has been the subject of so much
comment in political circles throughout
the City that it is but right that it should
be reproduced:
GOING TOO FAB.
No part of the Bryan campaign in the Mis
sissippi Valley has been more offensive to
American Â»oyalty and common decency than
the attacks which have been mane upon
Generals Sickles. Alger and HowarJ by some
of the radical supporters of the fusiOD ticket.
The canvass of these veteran defenders of ihe
Union seems to have excited the worst pas
sions of the Bryauites, and the brave old
soldiers have been maligned and insulted
Veyond the bounds of toleration by good
citizens.
The Omaha World-Herald, of which Bryan
was at one time tbe editor, is included by our
Eastern exchanges among the organs which
have been most vindictive in their attacks,
â but as we have not teen the language used
by that journal we may ltt it pass. Another
Bryanite organ, however, the South Omaha
Daily Ban, is quoted as having said:
A carload of old bummers, called "generals,"
are now touring the country on free passes and
their other expenses are belnc paid by * Hanna,
telling the people cow to vote. They were In
Omaha last night. When tbe people stop to con
sider why such skunks are so terribly Interested,
It is enough to sÂ«*:t!e the mat er that it is not any
love far ti.e poor man or the laborer that prompts
these '-kint-ra s" to thus swing aronnd the circle.
Such attacks upon men whom the country
honors have naturally aroused the indignation
of the people. It is not surprising, therefore,
to learn that when "Coin" Harvey ventured
upon a similar attack at Clinton, lowa, he was
liis&ed and booted into silence by the audience
which had gathered to hear him. He is
reported to have referred to the generals as
"old wrecks of the Rebellion who have lost
their honor and patriotism, and are tools of
political shygiers." Further than that, it seems
ne was not permitted to go by his audience,
and some of the more indignant patriots
present conld hardly be restrained from drag
ging him off the platform.
The American people allow to newspapers
and to stump orators a large license of speech,
hut there is a limit to that as to all thine*.
General Sickles, General Alger and General
Howard have attested their devotion to the
Union, their loyalty and their patriotic love
of the Republic" by services too arduous, too
honorable and too distinguished for any good
*- citizen to iit ia silence and bear them
maligned. It is about time that the agitators
and demagogues who have sprung up among
us were made to understand that the Ameri
can people have a feeling of profound rever
ence for the veterans of the war tor the Union,
and regard any defamation of them as an in
sult to themselves.
"Tliose are the sentiments we indorse,"
said Joseph Steele, a member of the com
mittee. "The Examiner might have said
as much if its sympathies had been with
the old veterans, but it let the shameful
incident go by without a word of protest."
F. Hanson, president of the McKinley
Veteran Soldiers' and Sailors' .Republican
Club, heartily seconded ilr. Steeie's re
marks and added tnat he and his compan
ions were surprised because no censure
had been passed on those intolerant and
bigoted speakers and editors wh" had
thus violently attacked American citizens
for exercising privileges guaranteed to j
them by the constitution and the laws.
In taking the position which it does in
this matter The Call feels that it is but
doing a plain duty. It would equally as
warmly defend * Democratic veterans
should they be assailed iv an unwar
ranted manner for supporting Mr. Bryan.
It would be a pretty state of affairs,
f-urely, if the men wno fought for tbe
preservation of the Union should at this
late day be coerced into a position when
they must accept instruction trom cam
paign orators as to tbe manner in which
they shall perform their civic duties. Of
all the men in the world these veterans
ought to be l*ft free to judge for them
selves and to act without restraint. Such
immunity The Call desires to see ex
tended to the Democratic and Republican
veterans alike, and for this it will ever
contend.
Yesterday afternoon a meeting of the
executive committee of the McKinley
Veteran Soldiers' and Sailors' Republican
Club waa held at 113 Turk street, where
the following resolutions were presented:
Whereas, The editorial columns of the San
Francisco Call of October 8 show that attacks
of a scurrilous nature have been made on cx
l ; uiou veteran Generals Sickles. Alger, How-
and others because said gentlemen nave
seen fit to ally themselves with the National
Republican party and work for the success of
William McKinley in the coming election,
thereby upholding tbe honor of tbe Nation
they fought to preserve; and whereas, those
attacks Save not been discountenanced by
either the National Democratic Committee
or their party organs, therefore be it
Resolved, That the executive committee of
the McKinley Veteran Soldiers' and Sailors'
Republican Club do denounce the National
Democratic Committee for not rebuking its
speakers and party organs for traducing men
that risked their lives for the preservation of
the Union.
Jteaoived, That the committee recommend
that at its next meeting the club orders 6000
copies of The Call containing the article re
ferred to, the ssme to be mailed to ex-Union
toidiers and sailors in this State at tbe ex
pense of tbe club.
Stirring addresses were made in support
of the resolution and The Call was
warmly commended for its utterances.
Colonel John Wniteside in a few well
chosen sentences replied to the aspprsions
of the Omaha Sun on tbe characters of
the distinguished gentlemen mentioned.
In a quiet, manly way, he said that be
ffllt be was but expressing the feelings of
all veterans, North and South, when he
denounced such calumny as un-American
and unpatriotic.
The resolutions were unanimously
adopted and ordered to be spread upon
the minutes. Secretary E. P. Morey being
requested to supply copies to the daily
papers of San Francisco for publication.

SHARKEY AND CAVILL
ThÂ© Pugilist Will Have a Chance of
Meeting the Champion Swim
mer of Australia.
Tom Sharkey, the pugilist, is probably
better at swimming than at fighting.
However that may be, Tom will have a
chance in the near future of proving to
the people of this country that he can de
fend the colors of Uncle Bam equally as
well in water as on land.
It may not be generally known that
Sharkey held the swimming champion
ship of the American navy for years, and
that he easily defeated the crack swim
mers of the Hawaiian Islands during the
time he was stationed at Honolulu. Shar
key is at home In the water, and during
the days he trained at the Cliff Hiruse he
thought nothing of swimming out to the
Seal Rocks and watching the antics of the
seals.
Wednesday evening Tom drifted into
Ferguson's, 719 Market street, and during
a conversation that followed Sharkey was
shown a picture of Cavill, the famous
swimmer.
"He is a fine looking fellow," remarked
Sharkey, "but 1 do not think that he is
such a phenomenal swimmer as he is
cracked up to be. I will wager that 1 can
swim across the channel in quiCKer time
than Cavill was credited with doing."
"Would you swim him a match, Tom ?"
some one asked, and tne pugilist answered
instantly that he was not afraid U) swim
any man on earth and that the longer the
distance the better it answered him.
"Then you are not afraid to meet
Cavill?"
'â¢Why, certainly not," said Sharkey,
"but I will not be ready to go into an
agreement for a swimming match until I
learn what Corbett intends doing regard
ing our tight."
Sharkey is very confident of defeating
any swimmer in the world, as he has
great faith in bis prowess as & natator.
It is said that Cavill intends to leave for
his home in Australia on the next out
going steamer, but possibly he may post
pone his departure for a month if good
inducements be offered him for a long
distance race against the hard - hit
ting pugilist and champion swimmer of
the United States navy.

"NO HATS" SAYS
THE CALIFORNIA
The Effect of That Little
Card at the Baldwin
Theater.
That Same Card Will Be
Played at the Opening of
Its Twin House.
FIRST J NIGHTERS REJOICE.
How a Few Ladies May Make Per
manent a Most Desirable
Consummation.
That little card placed in the hands of
lady patrons as they entered the Baldwin
Theater on Tuesday night, and the; effect
A Perspective of a Stage "Where a Sparkling and Absorbingly
Interesting* Drama is Being Enactedâ at Least so the Young
Lady in the Foreground Thinks. The Young Man Sitting
Immediately Behind Her Did Not Know So Much About It.
it had, seems to have given a new interest,
with indications of a new impulse, to
theater-coera.
The same card will be played at the
opening of the California Theater, which
is under the same management as the
Baldwin.
The effectâ every lady in a crowded
theater with bar hat off â presented a
novel and very attractive appearance, and
co increas p d the comfort of every indi
vidual in the audience, as well as adding
to the pleasure derived from the perform
ance, that there ia every likelihood that
tbe reform will become a fixed thing.
Habitues of the theater are delighted,
and declare that if the managers of the
Baldwin are permanently successful in the
crusade they will earn marble statues to
their memory whether tl^- ever get them
or not
"We have been at work toward this end,
you know, for about a year," said Mr.
Bouvier yesterday.
"The means we have hitherto employed,
however, have not worked many miracles.
The little card of last night, p.aced in the
hands of every lady as she entered the
theater, carrying to her a personal plea,
was responded to almost to the last
woman. Very many of the ladies wore a
small, flat bc-adaress that interfered with
the view of nobody. Those who were not
thus provided simply drew their hatpins
and laid their bats in their laps.
"Tbe management has received congrat
ulations from a great numb r of our
patrons, both by letter and wire. Many
of these letters are from ia ;ies saying that
they hoped the reform would be uerma
nent. However, it is all with the ladies
themselves No amount of mere legisla
tion will effect anything in this matter.
We requested them to take oft their hats
and they did it. Now it may be that they
themselves were so well pleased with the
experience that they will do so again and
again, and what was a novel experiment
will become the fashion.
"A comparatively few ladies may bring
about this result; for if a number of ladies,
weil known in society, would take off
their hats, others would do so merely by
way of following a good example â by way,
in other words, of being in tbe fashion.
It would be recognized as a matter of
good taste to remove the hat in the
theaterâ which it certainly isâ and the
reform would be then effected perma
nently. The pleasure of an evening at the
theater would be greatly enhanced for
women as well as men. We hope to see it
80.
'â¢By the way," said Mr. Bouvier, in con
clusion, "I have just received word that
at the Comedie Francaise in Paris a per
emptory notice has been posted that ail
ladies on the lower floor 'must' remove
their bats. The reform is being worked
by peremptory orders, it would seem, at
the home ofâ at the place where the big
1 hat was Invented."
The Quilt Case.
The jury in the > Quill damage suit was yes-
terday taken to Dwightway station, on the
Berkeley branch of the Southern Pacific Rail
road, at which May Quill met ncr death. The
case will be resumed to-day.
SWALLOWED POISON.
Charles F. Sherburne Attempts to Com

Hia Wife.
Charles F. Sherburne, a car-repairer
living at 917 Willow street, Oakland, swal
lowed a dose of carbolic acid in a room in
the Golden West Hotel yesterday after
noon in presence of his wife. He will
probably die. t
Sherburne has been drinking heavily of
late, and about ten days ago his wife left
him and went to live with friends on Web

Wednesday night, and threatened to com
mit suiciue unless &he returned to live
with him. As he had repeatedly, while
under the influeuce of liquor, made the
same threat, it had no effect upon her and
she refused his request.
He left her and went to the hotel, where
he engaged a room. He arose early yes
terday morning, left the hotel and re
turned about 10 o'clock. Mrs. Sherburne
received a message from him to call ai. tbe
hotel between 12 and 1 o'clock, as he
wanted her to go witr him to get his wages.
She reached the hotel about 1 o'clock,
and inquiring lor her husband the bell
boy toia her he was sick in bed. She went
to his room, and at once saw that he was
considerably under the influence of liquor.
He talked with her a few moments, then
poured the carbolic acid Irom a bottle into
a glaes and drans it. Mrs. Snerburne
gave tue alarm, ana he was taken to the
Receiving Hospital in tne ambulance in
an unconscious condition. Dr. Buunell
applied the usual remedies, but had small
hope of Sherourne's recovery.
The couple have a son in Sacramento,
who is a fireman on the Southern Pacific,
and Mrs. Sherburne telegraphed him to
Come to the City without delay.
MOST NAME PARTIES.
Important' Opinion Rendered by
Attorney-General Fitz
gerald.
He Instructs the S cretary of State
Concerning Certificates of Nom
ination.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald has "" for
warded the following important opinion
, to the [ Secretary of State in reference to
the filing of certificates of nomination:
r I am in receipt of your favor of the 2d inst,
in - which : you , state " that ."An organization
styled 'Socialist Labor party, etc.,' has caused
to be filed in this office certificates of : nomina
tion by petition for electors and Congressmen.
This party had no candidate before the people
at the last election, but have complied with
the provisions of : section 1188, Political Code
for this election," and >â  in which you V ask
"Should all nominations by petition be certi
fied as 'Independent' regardless of the title or
.party designation assumed and embodied in the
certificate itself?" ; ,C : .' ' â  f
". When nominations are made by conventions
"The certificate of nomination, which must be
in writing, shall * contain â  the name of each
person nominated, his residence, and the
office for which he is nominated, and shall
designate the party or principle which such
convention represents. 1 ' Political Code, sec
tion 1187. - *â¢ . r â  -.â â '.: ; ' â  , â â¢..â â .;..â â â ::. v J
:" Where nominations are = made by petition
the | certificate of .nomination must â¢ contain
"The name of the candidate to be nominated,
with the other Information ; required I to ;â  be
given in the certificates of I nomination ; made
by conventions." Political Code, section 1188.
I am of the opinion that the "other informa
tion" which the certificates of nomination of
persons nominated by petition mutt contain
in addition to the names of the candidaios to
be nominated is "his : residence and * the office
for which ; he ; is nominated," and the party or
principle which the electors ; signing the peti
. tion represent. . .::;. â '': v ;â¢-;<
* I am therefore of the further opinion that
it is your duty to '- include in your certificates
of all nominations which are made by petition,
in accordance with law, thÂ« party designation
or principle specified in the petition by the
electors signing i the i same; > provided,*;; such
party designation or principle Is not so nearly
identical with that of some regularly organ
ized : political pany which ils authorized to
make nominations by convention as to mis
lead or deceive the r public. â¢;-,â â¢ : ; - i

from the Secretary of ; State the Attorney-
General additionally instructed .' him yes

New and Peculiar Phase of
Pacific Bank Liti
gation.
Has Paid His Percentage of
Liability and New Wants
a Rebate.
HE INTERVENED IN A SUIT.
Asks That Ha Be Permitted to Share
in the Sixth Dividend, Now
Declared.
There is a new phase in the Pacific Bank
case. J. M. McDonald yesterday filed a
petition in intervention in the suit of the
Sacramento Bank against the Pacific
Bank. He alleges that he has paid in all
the money for which he is liable as a
stockholder and owner of 1738 shares of
the capital stock of the defunct institu
tion and now asks tnat he receive his per
centage of all future dividends declared
by it.
The interventor in his petition admits
all the allegations con'ained in the first
cause of action brought by the Sacramento
Bank versus the Pacific Bank, except that
which alleges that there is still due the
plaintiff $16,580. He also admits all the
allegations in tbe second cause of action,
except that which alleges that $2066 is due
the plaintiff, and further alleges that only
$11,731 is due.
Mr. McDonald, in support of his claim
for restitution, says that he has paid his
share of the stockholders' liability on all
of the first live dividends made, up to
December 24, 1895, amounting in all to
$2935 16, and that by reason of the pay
ment and satisfaction of his share of the
indebtedness he became entitled to plain
tiff's rights against the said bank in the
premise, and became entitled to receive
from the Pacific Bank his percentage of
all the rtividends that it may hereafter
declare and pay on that portion of said
debt wbicb was paid and satisfied by him.
He therefore prays that the Pacific Bank
be ordered to pay to hlrn 5 per cent on ac
count of the sixth dividend, which has
been declared by it, and on any dividend
which may be bereafter declared.

Danger to

The chances of total loss of manly power

vitally important that such indications be
attended .to ;at â¢ mice. i They should -. be
"checked while such a thing is possible, for
If they are permitted ;to continue, instead
of stopping naturally, they will become
greater from day to day, and will, in a few
years, completely disrupt the whole nerv-
ous and vital organism. "; Âvv .
Young men who notice what they con-
sider light symptoms of weakness do not
realize the danger that lurks in their path.
They do not understand the serious conse-
quences, the destruction of nerve tissue,"
waste of vital force and power ;of brain,
loss of t flesh, loss 'of -; memory I and total
im potency. These : are the f consequence!
that follow in the trail of slight evidences
of weakness. -;,â > :.

To protect your future manhood, to
guard against total loss of vitality, regain
your health now. Wt ile youth is at hand
to bring happiness and joy, such as comes

for forty-five years, and he never tires of tell-

for him. As for me, I would not take < all : the
gold in the country for my belt and go back to
the condition I was in two months ago, If I

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. &â Trading at the
Stock Exchange was fairly active to-day, 282.430
shares changing bands, but the great balk of the
business was in a few stocks, . indicating clearly
the professional character of the dealings. Sugar
alone figured for as much as 58,000 shares and St.
Paul, Burlington and Qulncy and Manhattan fol
lowed with- transactions of 33.800, 21.6-0 and
20,600 respectively. Nothing else was traded in
to the extent of 9000 full shares. i urin;Â» the early
part or the day the market waj feveii had un
settled under sales for both the lone and short
accounts. Continued liquidations in sugar had an
adverse Influence on the market and some boldeis
realized irrely in the angers, Manhattan and
other stocks. .
The decline was fqual to 148% per cent, the
latter In sugar, subsequently under the influence
of easy money the news of further engagements
of gol . in London for shipment to this side, specu
lation assumed a stronger .one and prices ad
vanced all along the line. â , Manhattan rose rapidly
from 88% to 91% on a revival of the rumors
about a deal pending with, the Metropolitan Trac
tion, and tobaico made an equally sharp advance
on covering of short contracts. This sto. k sold up
from 653,4 to 68%. The general list improved v*
to 3/g per cent, and the rise was well maintained
until just at the close, when sugar suddenly fell
front 107% to 107 under heavy sole*.
Louisviils and Nashville was strengthened by
the favorable character of the annual showing
made yesterday and on a belief that the Thomas-
Kya -Seaboard air line would put Â« speedy end to
the rate* troubles In the South. The market closed
weak for sugar and steady for the general list.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct. 8.-Trading In wheat this
morning was tame, but the feeling was rather a
nervous one. The opening .was lower by a. %
than i he close of yesterday, the principal condi
! tions responsible for the easiness being a decline
in prices at Liverpool and Berlin and a rather de
pressed condition of | New York stock. Offerings
were not heavy, however, and the slight loss was
regained in a short time. Receipts in the North
west were 1 150 cars against 986 last Thursday
and 1208 a year ago. Chicago received 296 cars
and inspected out 18 981 bushels.
The Price Current nummary reports encouraging
crops tor tne past wees, ioward noon the prices
advanced a full cent and a half, shorts covering
freely. A report that a cargo of wheat for India bad
been worked ibrougn Liverpool was origin of the
late strength. Closing Paris cables were higher as
compared witn Saturday; Antwerp was unchanged
and Berlin lower.
Export clearances were 385,238 bushels. De

CORNâ Was quite ri m. notwithstanding the
weakness hich prevailed in wheat early. Some
what smaller receipts than expect* d, 814 cars,
and heavy inspections from store, 600,868 bushels,
were of important assistance to prices, and the
rally in wheat which occurred lxter in the morn
ing added emphasis to the firmness- Liverpool
cables were 14a lower, but firm. TheCinclnnai
P. ice Cutreiit reported free offerings of corn.

The Work of Two Zealous Officers
Receives Marks of Distinguished
Appreciation.
PLEABANTON, Cal,, Oct. B.â This is
the last day of the session of the Grand
Council of the PortugueÂ»e Union.
The banquet kept the delegates up late
last evening, and it was 10 o'clock before
the session was called to order this morn
ing. A special committee was appointed
Prominent Grand Officers of the Portuguese Union and Three Citizens of Pleasanton Who Presided at
the Grand Ball and Reception to the Grand Council*
to pret>are the printing of the new con
stitution.
The office of deputy grand president
was abolished, as the order is in such a
flourishing condition that the office was
considered unnecessary.
A special committee was appointed to
reorganize a new system of bookkeeping
in the office of the grand secretary, on ac
count of ihe advance of the order.
The revised constitution submitted by
tbe committee appointed at the session
held in Sacramento last year was adopted
with but few changes.
The new constitution provides that
members of class A shall not pay more
than $20 and class B $10 a year, and when
any more money is needed it shall be
drawn from the reserve fund.
The installation of new officers occupied
the attention of the delegates this after
noon. Past President Mattos performed
the ceremonies in an impressive manner,
and on tbe new grand president
taking his seat there was great
cheering followed by. calls for a
speech. The grand president responded
by asking the co-operation of all to make
his administration a memorable one and
assured ail of the general interest he took
in the welfare of the organization and
thanked tbe delegates for the high posi
tion to which he was elevated.
â² badge was presented to M. S. Peixotto
Of Centerville for the work he has done
for the order in general. A beautiful
I badge was presented to the retiring grand
1 president, John Mattos Jr.
The selection of the next meeting place
of the Grand Council brought out five
competitors, San Francisco coming into
the contest this morning. San Leandro
won the honor after a spirited contest and i
the Grand Council after passing votes of
thanks to the local lodge for its entertain
ment, and also to tbe citizens of Pleasan
ton, adjourned to meet at San Leandro
next year. ____________________

908 Broadway, Oct. 8. }
The Central Baptist Association closed
its labors to-night with a public Young
People's service.
The report of the committee on educa
tion was of much interest. It contained
the following paragraphs:
''The interest d! the denomination at
{"ge needs to be stimulated and quick
ned, and the importance of the work in
t relation to our denominational growth
needs to be impressed upon our people,
many of whom have not given the matter
specific consideration. We are not com
petitor! in any sense to the State Univer
sity or high schools; our work is along
entirely different lines.
"Neither have we any criticism to make
upon the public or State institutions of
learning. They aie doing their work
grandly. We do not expect, and as Bap
tists we heartily oppose, municipal or
State schools attempting to give any re
ligious instruction."
The Women's Baptist Home Society
met at 11 a. m., with Mrs. W. H. Latour
ette presiding. In her address she de
clared that tbe society should raise $1000
during the ensuing year for the work if
possible.
Miss Mary Ham, who has charge of the
bureau of supplies, reported having sent
out $830 worth of goods. This went to ten
missionary pastors of the State.
Miss Lillian Berger, superintendent of
good literature, asked for contributions of
good magazines, papers and Sunday
school supplies to be distributed in needy
localities.
Mrs. E. H. Joy, as treasurer, reported
the total receipts'for the year to be $213 05,
expenditures $162, leaving a balance on
hand of $51 05.
This afternoon tbe Women's Baptist
Foreign Mission Society met, with the
president, Mrs. C. Hill, in the chair. Re
ports from Japan and China were pre
sented, after wbich the treasurer reported
a deficit of $1000.
The report of tne committee on resolu
tions contained a paragraph indorsing
the woman's suffrage amendment, which
caused quite a warm discussion and
showed that there was a difference of
opinion regarding the matter.
The vote showed that Mr. Wright, who
opposed suffrage, had three women to
vote with him, all the remainder of the
audience and delegates voting in favor of
the resolution.
The report of tbe â¢ommitte? on foreign
missions referrel to the ruobsof China j
and financial depression, which had r<*
duced the society's income, as clouds, but.
the (acts that entrance to missionaries had
been made saier and that 11,000 converts
had been baptized in tbe past year were
the silver linings. Thiity missionaries
have returned home during tbe year, 25
new ones have been sent out, 80 have re-
signed, and a number of deaths are re
ported. '";â â >;â¢:.-:â  ","-/*

ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. B.â The family of
J. N. Beckman, on the corner of Pacific
avenue and-Cbestnut street, were consid
erably frightened about ' 12 o'clock last
night to see two men climbing the back
stairs. The ladies were just retiring and
gave the alarm quickly, but in so doing
scared off the would-be burglars. They
went sliding down the banisters and
over the bacir. fence in short order.
A Claim Outlawed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. B.â The claim of
F. K. Krauth tor $30 against the city for
printing done in 1878 has been outlawed,
says City Attorney Taylor in an opinion
to the Board of Trustees. Continuing, he
says :
"A municipal corporation, however, is
under moral obligations to pay its debts;
the courts have held that tbe general ob
ligation to do justice binds all persons,
whether natural or artificial. I therefore
recommend, if your honorable board finds
that the amount demanded is correct, that
the claim be paid."
A. A. Cohen began injunction proceed
ings against the payment of this bill at
the time, and Mr. Krauth allowed it to
slip nis mind, thinking that the board had
been enjoined from paying it. Two weeks
ago he found it in his desk while cleaning
it up. The board will act upon the claim
next Monday night.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1896.
THE CHAMELEON
AND DEMOCRACY
Warren English Proves
Them to Be of the
Same Nature.
Wants Cleveland's Job, Bryan's
Favor and Free Silver All
at Once.
POLITIC?, FAMILY STYLE.
Now Stumping the District Trying
to Prove That Consistency Is a .
Needless Attribute.
The joke in Federal circles and among
Democratic politicians is on Warren B.
English, Collector of tbe Port of Oakland,
subject to -a resignation with a string to
it; Democratic and Populist nominee for
Congress from the Third District; an
office-holder by the grace of Orover Cleve-
land; by his own admission "a good ad
ministration Democrat"; at present an
ardent advocate of free silver, and known
in Oakland as the "subordinate villain" of
the Altamont melodrama, by which S. G.
Hilborn was robbed of his seat in the Con
gress of 1893.
The history of the Altamont affair is
known to everybody, and by it English
enjoyed two years in Congress during
which time all tbe Federal patronage in
niij district was distributed. Then came
tbe election of 1894 and Hilborn wiped
out tbe "crime of Altamont" by an over
whelming majority. This put English
out of office and something bad to be
done. His "friends," and they are numer
ous, decided that if there were no office
available for him one would have to be
created, for there is no precedent for an
English tbat desired a public position not
being able to obtain one in Alameda
County.
English came out as a firm adherent
and indorserof the Cleveland administra
tion. For a time Cleveland was his idol
and his administration his altar. An
agitation was started by which the city
across the bay should be made a port of
entry. A port of entry meant a Collector
of Port, and the effect of English's slavish
loyalty to the big man at Washington
was such tbat tbe office was created for
the Alameda politician at a handsome
salary. ,
Tilings went smoothly for a few months.
English sat in his little office, drew his
salary and talked politics, while a great
change came over the spirit of his
dreams. Cleveland became unpopular,
but English did not intend to fall with his
master; neither did he intend to get out
of a job. The mind that dominated the
Altamont affair was again brought into
play, and very gradually English was lea
to believe that he was not an administra
tion Democrat. In an unlucky moment
he so declared himself. This at once
brought down upon him the vials of John
P. Irish's wrath. The man who never
wears a necktie at once upbraided Eng
lish in an interview for uttering senti
ments of treachery to the man by whose
pleasure he was getting his bread and
butter. For a few days English and Irish
paid their compliments to each other
through the press until Irish went East
to hunt heavier came and was lost to
Alameda political circles.
Then was born the fusion proposition
and English appeared as an ardent fusion
ist. Bryan was his idol and free silver his
altar and according to English tbe country
in general and the Third Congressional
District in particular could only be saved
from an unlimited number of HacUa by
the election of Warren B. English for Con
gress. This brought about a state of chaos
that no one but a master^ manipulator of
politics in Alameda County could hope to
disentangle. English was nominated for
Congress by tbe Democrats and indorsed
by the Populist?. The Third District was
then presented with the strange spectacle
of an avowed Cleveland gold man and an
administration office-holder howling for
free silver, denouncing the administration
of which he claimed to be and was and is
an adherent and at the same time holding
Bryan as the only Moses that could lead
a cursed nation out of the wilderness.
Something bad to be done. English
could not consistently draw a large
monthly salary from a Government wbich
be was doing his best to overthrow; at
the same time he had no intention of re
linquishing that salary if he could make
any decent appearance before his con
stituency and still hold on to it. This
situation might appear a very intricate
one to the ordinary mindâ not so to
English. Alter being assured that a
resignation would not be accepted, Eng
lish, with a loud flare of trumpets, handed
in his resignation as Collector of the Port
of Oakland, with a strong string to it.
Tbe string is still attached to it and
amounts to an intention to hold on to his
office across the bay after his chameleon
policy shall have been repudiated by the
voters on November 3. While the resigna
tion is apparently absolute, it is in such
shape that Mr. Wise can eastly return it
on November 4, and there is no doubt
this will be done.
In the meantime Mr. English is going
over his district campaigning as a good
Bryan Populist-Democrat, and hopes
thereby to defeat Mr. Hilborn.
Methodist (South) Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. B.â The Pacific
Methodist (Smith) conference opened its
second day's labors this morning. Bishop
Hargrove, in his remarks, stated that the
exact figures were not so much wanted as
the fact whether there had been advance
ment or retrogression. He Baid the
spiritual state of the church should be
judged not so much by the financial ex
hibit as by the number of additions to the
charge. B. J. Waugh was taken in charge
by an investigation committee and several
were admitted to the conference.
Much minor business was transacted,
but the chief work of the gathering is to
hear reports and locate all the ministers
for the next year.
An Independent Candidate.
OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. B.â Thomas Pear
son, tbe colored orator, has filed his peti
tion of nomination for Assemblyman in
the Fifty-eighth Assembly District. It
has the approval of the District Attorney
placed upon it which insures his name be

W. H. PARKHURST BURIED
Remains of the Youthful Evange
list Interred at Mountain
View.
End of tbe Remarkable Career of
a Bright Berkeley
Boy.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. B.â The closing
scenes of the remarkable career of young
Webs' er H. Parkhurst were enacted to
day, when the remains of the strangely
enthusiastic and youthful evangelist were
laid away in the family vault in Mountain
View Cemetery. The funeral services
were held at St. Mark's Episcopal Church.
The deceased was one of a company of
boyish workers in tbe cause of religion
who about a year ago began to pursue
with extraordinary zeal tbe vocation of re
ligious stump speakers. Parkhurst was a
member of the Berkeley High School
class of '96 and was to have entered the
State University with that class.
Then came the "call to preach for
Christianity and to announce the near ap
proach of "the last days." The remon
strance of his parents and friends and the
advice of the rector of St. Mark's Church
were alike unavailing. The young man
laid aside his boofca and applied himself
to evangelical effort.
Tne young man was only 18 years of age,
but be felt that he had a mission to per
form and be disregarded the pleading of
relatives, the advice of friends and the
ridicule of scoffers with the serene, unas
sailable confidence of a veritable martyr.
Co-Edi Commence "Gym" Work.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. B.â The addi
tions to Harmon Gymnasium at the State
University, recently made for the accom
modation of the co-eds, are now completed,
and the young women will at once begin
their exercises in physical culture. About
126 will join the clashes this year, which is
more than double the number in regular
attendance last year. Tbe training of the
young women will be under the direction
of Professor and Mrs. WÂ« E. Magee.
During the period set aside for their Â«ym
uasium work tbe young women will have
exclusive use of tbe gymnasium.

"COUNT AMBROSEWF," WHO
CLAIMED TO BE A RUSSIAN
NOBLE MAN.
Count Ambrosewf will probably never
return to Oakland. That is the opinion
of those who have had tbe most intimate
dealings with him.
The letter that he received from St.
Petersburg a few weeks ago was a rery
different document from wnat the Count
said it was. Instead of telling him that
the Russian estate to which he said he
was heir bad been distributed and was
coming to him at Portland, Or., it was a
letter that reprimanded him for his ab
surd pretensions.

of this city who remember when they were
paid in silver and had to. pay a premium
for gold and who do not want to see a re
turn to those conditions. The Oakland
THOMAS PRATHER of the Executive Committee of the Soond-
Money League*
Business Men's Sound-money League has
no political affiliation, but is eager to do
its share toward upholding the National
credit.
Many of the members hare been life
time Democrats, but they now realize that
the limit of rainbow politics has been
reached and that a firm and judicious step
must be taken. Among the members are:
J. J. Valentine, John A. Britton, E. J.
Pringle, Warren Olney, Israel Lawton,
John A. Btanly, Sam Bel! McKee and J. C.
Martin, all of whom are Democrats.
"We have found that there are hun
dreds of residents of this county who are
not acquainted with the issues in this
campaign," said B. O. Trowbridge of the
executive committee to-day, "and we are
preparing to enlighten them. Several of
our business men will go out to the little
places and hold meetings in ranchhouses or
barns or in the open air and will show the
fallacy of the free-silver idea. There are
many little places that are being neglected
by the campaigners of various political
parties and we want to reach them. ' The
league is rapidly growing and there are
now several hundred members, and the
next three weeks will be very busy ones
for us."
Hugh Craig declares that politics should
cut no figure in the financial question.
He recalled the time when he first came
here and went to work for Burnhum,
Standeford & Co. at $1 75 a day. Tna
workmen were paid by the firm, as was
the custom of all other firms then, in sil
ver, which was at a discount. All the
gold collected by business men was sold to
the banks at 3 or 4 per cent profit and the
workmen paid in depreciated money. Mr.
Craig is not anxious for a return of those
"good old times."
J. J. Valentine said that another reason
for the present unrest was a false idea of
corporations. Ho said he was the hired
man of a corporation that consisted of
1000 stockholders, who are scattered all
over tbe United States.
Thomas Prather, R. 8. Knight, . J. L.
Barker, C. B. Morgan and Mark Kequa are
other active workers in the league and
their ranks are swelling daily.

OFFICE AND FREE PASSES
Liability for the Acceptance of
a Pass Discussed by
Justices.
Writ Aimed at Insurance Commis
sioner Higgins Is Denied by the
Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court yesterday denied
the petition of the Attorney-General for
the people, which whs directed against
Insurance Commissioner M. R. Higgins.
The case involved the contest by C. Ges
ford for the insurance commissionership.
There were two counts in the petition,
which was for a writ of mandamus. The
first count alleged that Higgins had in
truded himself into the office, and that he
had uo title to it. The second alleged that
Higgins had accepted and was using a
pass over the Southern Pacific road, and
it was asked that Gesford be declared,
therefore, entitled to the office, and that
Higgins be fined $5000.
A part of the opinion of the court, which
was written by Justice McFarland and was
concurred in by Justices Van Vleet and
Garroutte and by Chief Justice Beatty, so
far as denying the writ was ooncerned,
was partly given up to the consideration
of the degree of criminality in accepting a
railroad pass. On this point, the opinion
ran as foil lows:
It is true that the mere acceptance of a pass
Is In Itself no crime, but one who holds office
ana a pass at the same time may be subjected
by a proceeding like the one here to a severe
criminal punishment. It is at least doubtful
if he could be compelled to give evidence
against himself.
The opinion concludes as follows :
The Issuance of the writ would forever pre
clude any defense upon its merits. Uoder the
above views it Is unnecessary to inquire what
similarity there Is between the proceedings of
the people vs. Higgins and the old writ of quo
warranto. The prayer of the petition ia de
nied and the writ dismissed.
Justice Harrison filed a dissenting
opinion, in which Justices Temple and
Henshaw concurred. In this the liability
involved in the acceptance of a pass by a
public officer was considered. The dis
senting opinion says:
There is no ground for considering that the
present action is instituted under the pro
visions of section 772 of the Penal Code or
tnatit is to be regarded as criminal in its
nature.
The Superior Court can act under that eec
| tion only when it has received an accusation
1 in writing that the officer has charged and
collected illegal fees or has refused or ne
glected to perform the offioial duties pertain
ing to his office. The only grounds alleged in
the complaint here are the failure to file a
sufficient bond and the subsequent acceptance
and use of a free pass. * * * Of neither of
these acts can there be predicated any turpi
tude or neglect of official duty.
The acceptance of a pass has no more of the
elements of a criminal nature than would be
in the acceptance by any officer oi a lucrative
office under the United States, or the absence
from the State of a judicial officer for more
than sixty days, or the voluntary removal
from the county for which the officer was
eiected, either of which acts womd be a
ground for declaring that he could no longer
exercise the office.
Whether in addition to such a judgment a
fine shall be imposed upon the defendant is by
express terms left to the Superior Court; but
the right to exercise its discretion In this par
ticular does not limit or qualify its duty to'en
ter the judgment of ousW. â¢ â¢ â¢ The dis
cretion given to the court is not to determine
whether it will act, but Is limited to the mode
in which it will act. â¢ â¢ â¢ In my opinion
, the application for the writ should be granted.

NOT EQUALED
SINCE THE WAR
Ex- Senator Felton on the
Gravity of the Situa
tion.
All East of the Mississippi Be
lieved to Be Solid for
McKinley.
HOPES OF TWO COAST STATES.
Views of the National Committeeâ A
Question of Honesty and Existence
of the Government
Ex-United States Senator Charles N.
Felton has returned here after five months
in Virginia and Maine and other places,
where be has been with his family. While
in the East he visited Michigan, Illinois
and neighboring States.
The ex-Senator says there has all along
been the deepest interest in the Presi
dential contest. It was intense for a time,
bat is waning now a little by the con
viction that Major McKinley will be
elected. This belief has increased the con*
ndence in the future business situation.
Mr. Felton says he felt that if be could
do any good for the cause of Republican
ism he could probably do most in Cali
fornia, and therefore if it is desired that
he make some speeches he will do so for
the good of the cause. Asked about the
condition of the campaign, as he had been
able to gather It, he said:
"The consensus of opinion is that there
is no question that McKinley will carryall
the Slates east of the Mississippi, and by
a majority that will astonish the people.
I gathered this from well-informed men
whom I met, and who were in the best
possible position to gain all the facts. This
ia the condition east of the >' 'ssissippi.
"lowa, wbich is on this lids, baa been
carefully canvassed by the uiuck system,
and no less than three times, and the low
est estimate made is that it will go for
McKinley by 40,000,
"Pifclic sentiment there and in the East,
as manifested, is changing daily toward
McKinley, because the sober second
thought is, leaving silver out of tbe ques
tion, that tbe stability of this Government
is at stage. The National Committeemen
in New York and Chicago have, as they
say, no question as to tbe final result,
since the people are taking cognizance of
this.
"There is pervading the committee,
however, some slight doubt as to the Pa
cific Coast. It is hoped we will carry Cali
fornia and Oregon, not so mucb that they
are necessary as to Impress upon tbe peo
ple that the masses are in lavor of hon
esty as against the repudiation of debts,
public and private.
"They are unable to see how social and
political organizations can exist except by
honesty and confidence between man and
man. " Therefore, the people have
awakened in order that there may be no
doubt when the question of tbe Govern
ment is at stake.
"As to Bryan and the crowds which
hear him, he draws large audiences, as
any man will who has been nominated
for tQe Presidency, for they want to see
what kind of a man he is. The consensus
of opinion is that his speeches are compo
sitions of assumption, declaration and
declamation, barren of logic and not based
on any fact.
"There is deep interest on both sides in
the contest, but it is not as- intense as it
was, because the people believe McKinley
will succeed. The present indications are
that financial distress will not be intensi
fied, and therefore confidence ia being re
stored."
Mr. Felton believes that if Mr. Bryan
should be elected times will be im
measurably worse, and that those who
work for wages will feel it more than any*
body else, and to a degree scarcely now to
be realized.
"It is a condition so grave," said he,
"that it has never been approached in the
history of the Republic, except when we
fought for our independence with Eng
land, and during the last Civil War."
Jennie Parsons' Will.
On application of Talcott Larsons et al.,
Judge Slack yesterday dismissed the petition
for and denied the probate of the document
purporting to be the last will and testament
of Jennie Parsons, deceased. It was proved
that the testatrix aid not date ihe paper, and
that it was not signed by two attesting wit
nesses.
A Former Partner Sues.
The warehouse firm of Wilson Brothers &
Co. was attached yesterday by Charles T.
Rodolph, a former partner in the concern, for
$1000. The sum mentioned was the price
promised by tne other members for Rodolph's
interest, but as it was not paid at the time
specified in the agreement he sued.

POPULISTS FIGHT
OVER SPOILS
An Official Organ Recog
nized Before Its
Birth.
Uroke of Thrift by the State
Central Executive Com
mittee.
MR. KINNE AND HIS PAPER-
His Candidacy for Congress Denounced
by His Own People and the
Party Press.
"The high priests of the People's party
State Central Committee were wild this
morn ing when they read the interview with
me in The Call," said the People's party
man yesterday. "Wardall and Bush
frothed at the mouth and Tom Cator
wept.
"As every Populist with the solitary ex
ception of John C. Gore is an orator
every one thinks be is able to do crooked
politics and rnn a party paper. While
Chris Buckley and Sam Rainey have been
doing them up brown they have been
plotting to do each other up.
"Here is an instance in point. A. B.
Kinne is reported to stand behind the
'Voice of .Labor,' one of the many week
lies of the kind published in San Fran
cisco. He is a prominent member of the
State Central Committee. But the com
mittee passed by Mr. Kinne's paper,
didn't even look at the Populist, a weekly
manaeed by William G. C. Pitt and V. W.
McNeil), and recommended that, a paper
not then in existence, be recognized as the
orpan ! That set Barney and Pitt and
McNeiil and a few others gnashing their
teeth.
The committee's report was as follows:
Your committee having investigated the
proposition of giving to a boua-fide weekly
reform journal the indorsement of the execu
tive committee of the Peop c's party, said pub
lication to be issued from tnis City, do recom
mend that _. D. Crawford _ Co. are worthy of
unqualified indorsement.
There can be no question that a fearless
reform journal is needed in the metropolis of
this coast, and the spasmodic journalistic
efforts that do not command the support of
the party adherents warrant us In differen
tiating in favor of what we consider an honest
effort to establish permanently in San Fran
cisco a journal of political and literary merit.
M. E. Dittmar, George D. Gillespie, J. A.
Johnson, special committee.
Attest: R. E. Bush, secretary State Central
Committee People's Party.
"The funny thing in the whole matter
is the fact that while the report was made
on September 8, the paper (which is called
the Californian) was not issued until
September 19. Kinne didn't like it a little
bit, for the following editorial appeared in
the Voice of Labor a short time afterward:
Tnere is no official or semi-official organ of
the People's party in this State, and a commit
tee report oi interested parties which was laid
on the table or placed on file and vig never
acted' upon carries with it no indorsements,
particularly before the paper was ever issued.
There may be some chumps at headquarters,
but not enongh of them to do a thing of this
kind.
"The Populist gets mad also and slaps
Kinne as follows, adding insult to iniury
by misspelling his name:
Shylock Kinney, aspirant for Cocgress In the
Fifth District, through a windfall", has come
into possession of a few dollars lately. Kin
ney is -'shaving warrants among the employes
of the city government." Anything to turn
an "honest" penny, you know. Per cent, per
cent; he wants the pound of flesh.
.McNeil! dashes off the following at the
State Central Committee:
Unable to gain the snpport of the honest
Populist and siiver press of this State, a few
"would-be Populist Dosses," in order to attract
personal attention and hear themselves talk,
have delegated to themselves, their heirs and
assigns forever, the king-born right to speak
for the Populists. After passing a self-consii
tnted Board of Censors, upon the merits of
something thp.t did not exist, they declare to
the people that they "differentiatingly" favor
a journal "of political and literary merit."
How can this intelligent (") Beard of Censors
pass judgment upon the "political and literary
merit" of something that did not exist when
the antemortem took place ? With Republican
gold they have secured a brand-new orean of
their own and some well-trained monkeys to
go with it. Great Caesar's ghost, just think of
a poor, hard-working, laboring man paying $2
a year for the privilege of listening to the In
fliction of these self-constituted, "fearless" re
formers, every one of whom has been, is now,
Â«nd will be a supplicating and persistent can
didate for office, nowand forever. Two dollars
a year T
'Editor McNeill then took another fall
out of Kinne, as follows, under the bead
ing 'Down With Bigotry':
We areopposed to anyone holding an office of
public trust who has prejudice against any for
eign-born citizen on account of race and reli
gion, or who has a hobby that he proposes to
ride to the exclusion of all other public inter
ests. Kinney, aspirant for Congress from the
Fifth District, is an outspoken opponent of
foreign-born citizens â particularly the Irishâ
and also prejudiced on the ground of religion,
by reason of his well-known past membership
in the A. P. A. * â¢ â¢ We want men to repre
sent the "whole people," and not a section,
class or clique â men to represent "all the in
teresis" of the people, and not one particular
ot.ject or hobby, to the sacrifice and exclusion
of all others. California has already suffered
enough in her legislative halls through illite
racy, prejudice and incompetency. Kinney
cancer:ainly lay claim before the voters of
the Fifth District to all these three aforemen
tioned acquirements.
" A little wnile ago I mentioned John
C. Gore, a member of the State Executive
Committee. Gore is a collector for the
Spring Valley Water Works and when he
as a Ponulist denounces soulless corpora
tions there is no doubt that he does so
with a mental reservation in favor of his
employer. Gore is a taciturn man, but
quite a connubiator. He is as intolerant
as the rest of us when he gets on horse
back. Thus when Mr. Pitt resuscitated
the Populist Gore wrote him a note read
ing about as follows:
How dare yon start a paper without consult
ing me?
"Pitt wrote a note in reply intimating
that Gore might go further than purga
tory and fare worse.

FISH IN STREAMS.
Nearly 500,000 or Them to Be Added
to Sonoma Creek.
A. V. La Motte of Glen Ellen, Sonoma
County, who for a long time has been
interesting himself in increasine the finer
food fishes in various streams, is at the
Grand. He has been representing tne San
Francisco and North Pacific Railroad and
has this year put several hundred thou
smd small fisn in the streams. He said
Wednesday night:
The San Francisco and North Pacific Railway
Company has been devoting considerable
attention to the waters along the line of its
road fhis season in the way of restocking them
with trout fry. The Blue Lakes have received
300,000 Tahoe trout and 15,000 of the German
brown trout known as the Yon Behr trout;
100,000 more have been placed in the trout
streams of Sonoma and Mendocino counties,
and I will leave in the morning with 100,000
moie for the tributaries of Sonoma Creek, in
the Sonoma Valley.
As these trout hnve all been planted under
careful supervision the result must goon be
apparent in the Increased catches of fishermen.
The fry have been furnished by tne State Fish
Commission, who have made a specialty this
season of the Tahoe trout, which bids fair to be
a great success in current streams.
TRADE WITH JAPAN.
The Manufacturers' Association Ac
tively Interested in Oriental
Commerce.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation is at present interested in build
ing up a healthy trade as shown by the
following letter, copies of which have been
sent to all of its members:
K. Noro. vice-president and managing di
rector Naigwai Bussan Trading Company
Kobe, Japan, has been in the City the past few
days and is now on his way Enst. His visit to
the United States is for the purpose of enlarg
ing the business of the company he represents,
which is that of dealing in foreign manu
factures. It being impossible for him to see
sli of the manufacturers of the City he desires
this association to advise you that his com
pany would like you to send them catalogues,
price lists, and, if possible, samples of the
goods you manufacture.
He advises us that his company will under
take to sell the goods in Japan upon commis
sion and guarantee the accounts. As we are
informed his company is a wealthy and re
liable one, it would seem to be en opportunity
for you to place your goods on the Japanese
market at a less expense and mor^ readily
than if you were to send a special representa
tive there.
The balance of trade between Japan and for
eign countries is against the United States.and
in favor of England. Japan's exports in 1894
were to the United States $43,323,557, to Eng
land $5,950,198, while her imports for the
same year were: From England" $42,189,874,
from the United States $10,982,508.
Inasmuch as we are Japan's best customer,
it would seem that an effort on our part ought
to enable us to recover considerable of the
$31,000,000 excess of trade that now goes to
England.
We trust that you will communicate with
the above company at once and that good re
sults will follow. Yours truly',
L. R. Mead, Secretary.
BURNING WORDS OF LOVE
They Were Addressed by Ferdi
nand Parker to M^ss
Bryant.
He Was Arrested for Betrayal Under
Promise of Marriage, but the
Case Was Dismissed.
The case of Ferdinand E. Parker,
charged with betrayal under promise of
marriage, was dismissed by Judge Conlan
Wednesday.
Parker is a bookkeeper fora cigar manuÂ«
facturer at 406 Sixth street, and is 33 years
of age. The complaining witness was
Margaret Bryant, a buxom cook, 29 years
of age.
According to her testimony she became
acquainted with Parker in November,
1893. They met frequently afterward and
at Christmas that year he proposed mar
riage to her and was accepted. On April <
3, 1894, they commenced livine together as j
man and wife without the formality of a
ceremony and continued in the relaiion |
till May 1 of this year, when he refused to
have anything more to do with her.
During that time iney had lovers' quar
rels, and she would leave him for a time.
On these occasions Parker wrote her let
ters full of burning words of love, and she
went back to him again.
On October 13, 1894, he wrote her a. long
letter, which concluded as follows: "But
my star is gone from me forever â aye, lor
evermore, I feel. I shall perhaps see you
no more. It makes we weep to think; it
breaks my heart. A thousand kisses to
yon, my own, my love, my darling wife." i
On another occasion he surpassed him
self in the following impassioned words:
''You are gone away, far away, but the
memory of your sweet smile still lingers
with zne. i wish I could see you again
I and again, and again to boid you in my
arms, to kiss you, to caress you and to
tell you how much I love you. But why, j
oh why should I tell you this when you
do not love me."
Notwithstanding all this the Judge de
cided that Margaret had failed to substan
tiate the charge.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1896.
NEW DUGS OF
DEIDWOOD GULCH
A Rush From Forty Mile
and Other Places to
Another Rich Camp.
Mat Weber, a California Woods
man, Holds Down the
Best Claims.
ARE NEAR CIRCLE CITY.
Wi liam Daiton's Experiences of
Three Yearsâ Enormous Herds
of Cariboo.
William Dalton, a gold miner of far
Circle City, Alaska, arrived here yester
day, and is at the Lick. He says there is
a new gold excitement in that part of the
Yukon, and there is a rusji to it. The dis
trict is the richest yet found on the Yu
kon. It is known by the name of Dead
wood Gulch.
"The new diggings of Deadwood Gulch,"
saÂ»d he, "are seventy miles northeast of
Circle City, on the opposite side of the di
vide, between Crocker Creek and Harri
son Creek. The principalt>wner of placer
ground there is Mat Weber, formerly a
woodsman in the California redwoods.
He got there first, and because of his dis
covery is, according to the mining laws,
allowed more ground than anybody else.
"When I left about forty men in all had
been working in the new district. The
ground is so rich^ in some places that it
runs as much as seven ounces to the pan,
which is something enormous. Of course
this is seldom.
"The average is about $50 a day to the
man. The clean-up of seven men for five
days' shoveling was reported to me at 257
ounces. The gold is worth $16 an ounce
in coin, or $17 in trade.
"In consequence of the new discovery
there is a rush to Deadwood Gulch. Ail
the miners of Forty Mile have pulled out
for the new diggings, and others are also
going there from different sections. In all
probability there will be a big camp in
D. aawood Gulch.
"I have been mining on Hogham Creek,
near Circle City. About 000 men have
been at work there, and they have done
reasonably well. I have been on the
Yukon three years, and consider it the
best gold country of which I have any
knowledge.
'â¢If it were not for the ice there, which
lasts substantially the year round, it
would be the greatest of all countries. We
worked our mines by first thawing the ice
by fires made from the dry wood, an
abundance of which is to be found there.
"I intend going back to the l'ukon in
March, for since the depression in silver,
when I left Icfaho, i consider that the best
place for a miner to make money. Circle
viile has about 1300 people as a popula
tion when the miners come in for the
winter.
"At certain times of the year there are
a great many cariboo in the region where
lam mining. I have een in the spring
as many as from 500 to 5000 at a time cross
ing the divide, and in August of each year
have seen tliem crossing back.
"I saw an Indian who killed 105 one aft
ernoon. He sold the hindquarters around
to the camp a $2 a leg. This might look
like making money, but whisky costs 50
cents a drink there, and the Indians drink
a great deal of it when they can get it.
These legs wouldn't weigh over twenty
pounds each. The cariboo are very thin
at certain times of the year.
"There i* a worm that gets into them,
excepting in the part I have stated, and it
renders the meat unfit for use. If you
pull off the hide and hold it up you will
lind it lull of holes and worthless, made
so by the worms."
Mr. Dalton was accompanied to this city
by C. Shoa, who has been mining near
Juneau, and J. E. Evans of Cooks Inlet.
Mr. Evans says that outside of the Polly
Mining Company, which took out about
$30,000 during the past year, and twoolner
companies, the gold of Cooks Iniet doesn't
amount to anything.
KELLY MURDER TRIAL.
The Case Again- 1 the Supposec"
Slayer of Soldier Joseph
Quinn.
Stories Told on the Witness-Stand by
Men Who Took Part in the
Fatal Fight.
The second day of the trial of James
Kelly for the murder of Joseph Quinn
was comparativeJy uninteresting. No
new points vere brought out, the story of
the killing being told and retold.
Georee W. Ressel, the draughtsman of
the Police Department, was the first wit
ness. He produced a drawing, showing
the location of different objects in the
vicinity of the place where the deed was
committed.
John P. Jones, an enlisted soldier,
described the fight in which Quinn lost his
life as lie saw it. He swore that there was
a general row in . progress b -tween several
men, and that Kelly rushed at Quinn, who
stasrgered, and as the witness arrived to
aid him, gasped, '"I'm cut," and fell.
Dr. George M. Wells, the post surgeon
at Fort Mason, described the nature of the
wounds of the deceased, but added noth
ing new to the facts already known.
Captain A. W. Vogdes told of the find
ing of the bloody razor with whioh tho
crime is supposed lohave been committed,
and Dr. G. S. Barret confirmed the testi
mony of Dr. Wells.
John R. Whelan, who was one of the
men engaged in the fight, was very bitter
against Kelly. His testimony was the
most damaging of the day, except that it
wasabsolutely invalidated by tho acknowl
edgment Whelan was forced to matce that
he had done time in a penitentiary for
burglary.
Harry Milis, another enlisted man who
was mixed up in the fatal fight, testified
that Kelly exhibited a razor when in the
canteen, where the men were drinking,
and remarked that if anybody treated him
meanly he would use it on them
The trial goes on to-day.
Bricklayers and Silver.
The following communication Is self-ex
planatory :
Ban Francisco, Cal., Oct. 7, 1896.
Editor Call : A convention of bricklayers in
the East passed a resolution indorsing free
sliver. A newly formed society of bricklayers
In this City indorsed the ncion of that con
vention. This newly formed body must not b*
confounded with the old and well-organized
San Francisco Bricklayers' Association. We
h-jve passed no resolution indorsing free sil
ver. Whatever the Individual opinions of our
members may be on that subject, they prefer
to keep the discussion of politics and religion
outside oi their meetines. Yours truly,
John B. Campbell,
President San Francisco Bricklayers' Asso
ciatioii.

KELLY BITTERLY UPBRAIDS THE EXAMINER
Lays on the Lash Without
Stint and Without
Mercy.
Its Proprietor and His Career in
Public and Private Re
viewed.
THE SPEAKER DECLARED HE
IS PERSECUTED.
Assigns the Three Main Reasons for
the Antagonism of Hearst and
His Journal.
Joseph P. Kelly's announcement that
he intended to discuss the attitude of the
San Francisco Examiner toward him,
toward the Democratic party and toward
all things which it undertook to advocate
or oppose drew an attendance that was
unable to find sitting room in Metropoli
tan Hall last nignt.
Kelly is the obdurate nominee for Con
press of the regular Democratic Conven
tion of tbe Fifth Congressional District,
and refused to withdraw from the contest
to make room for a fusion candidate in
the person of A. B. Kinne. He is now
making an independent campaign, and if
the enthusiasm that was displayed by the
assemblage that gathered to hear him last
night is any indication of his power and j
popularity in his district, Mr. Kinne will j
have a hard time realizing that he was
ever engaged in a contest with the bold
and defiant independent.
In the course of his review of the career
of William R. Hearst and that of his jour
nal, the Examiner, Mr. Kelly laid on the
agony without stint and without mercy.
Neither the private nor public life of the
Examiner's proprietor nor the public life
of his dead father was neglected, though
Mr. Kelly had promised to reirain from
personalities as far as he felt he would be
justified in doing in view of the manner in
which the Examiner had "maligned, slan
dered and persecuted" him in order to
vent upon him the pfc'rsonal spite of Mr.
Hearst.
He declared that there were three rea
sons why he bad been selected by Mr.
Hearst as a victim of his ''malicious and
vicious attack-." The final motive Mr.
Hearst had, ne said, was because the
speaker had be?n a successful candidate
against him for the presidency of the
Olympic Club; the second, he declared,
was that he had reiused to vote for Mr.
Hinton, the Examiner's candidate
for Railroad Commissioner two years ago,
and the third, he intimated, was that the
Examiner had been employed by the raii
road company to defeat him for Con
gress.
Harry Keliey, chairman of the Thirty
seventh District Assembly Club, intro
duced the speaker. His address in sub
stance follows:
"I have appeared before you to-night for
the purpose oi addiessing you upon the
issues of tne day, and also in relation to
my candidacy under the auspices of the
Thirty-seventh District Club- ;l
After expressing his regards and appre
ciation for the work of this club in sup
porting him iv this campaign and making
his excuses for speak in- ouiaideot hisowu
district, he continued as follows:
: 'I desire at this time to go into my
canvass of two years ago, and in that con
nection also to talk of that paper to whica
I will hereafter more specifically refer.
[Applause.]
"I propose to show you how a man can
be a vicum of newspaper persecution, and
after 1 get through with tnis paper and its i
proprietor, and after I show the motives
and spite that emanates from its proprie
tor I guarantee tnat not a person will not
say that his action and conduct is a dis
grace to the journalism of this State.
"I was a candidate two years ago ior
Congress, but was never befoie that a can
didate lor any public office, and had not
been an aspirant for that oflice. I was a
member of the Democratic State Conven
tion which met at the Ba dwin Hotel, and
which nominated the present Governor of
this State. In that convention there were
a great many combinations made to secur.'
control ol the convention in the interests
of the raiiroad people. The different dele
gations met separately for the purpose of
iKitmnuting Congresbmen and Railroad
Commissioners. At the time that the
Fifth Congressional District convention
met it was known tnat the district was
Republican, and there was not a single
man wutiin the borders of that district
who would asiree to carry the banner of
the Democratic party there. Tliey tried
to persuade me to accept the nomination,
and I positively refused; but they finally
induced me to accept it. i had previously
been offered the nomination of Superior
Judge, District Attorney and State Sena
tor, but bad declined the honors; but
when the party made a call upon me to
serve them in my Congressional district
two years ago I felt tiiat in duty to tne
party I must accept, and did so.
'".Now what happened in relation to my
candidacy? An independent candidate
was injected into the fight. It was done
throug the agency of th% San Francisco
Examiner, and the opposition and anim

osity of that paper went to such an ex
tent that it insisted tbat the man who
should run acainst me should have for
the initial letter of hi 1 - name such a letter
as would place him first on the ballot, and
when it came to the publication of the
ballot itself, that paper in the publica
tion of a copy of that ballot maliciously
and prerneditatedly left off my name from
the sam pie ballot that it published. The
opposition to my candidacy of that paper
Irnay state springs from several motives.
"In 1887 for the first time in my lite
it was my fortune to run counter to Mr.
Hearst. In that year I was a member of
the San Francisco Olympic Club, and in
that year we had one of the bitterest elec
tionsthat ever took place in its whole
history. I was on one ticket and Mr.
Hearst on the other. I defeated him by
live votes, and from that day to this he
has carried his personal animosity into
tne columns of his paper with a view to
injuring and ruining my political life."
Hisses and groans followed this an
nouncement, and there were also shouts of
"He can't do it," and "Good boy ! Give it
to him. Kelly."
Mr. Kelly referred to his past career and
called the attention of his hearers to the
fact, as alleged by him, that it bad always
been above reproach. Continuing, he
said:
"Two years ago, you remember, there
was a hot contest in the Democratic con
y ntion io secure the nomination for Rail
road Commissioner for this district. There
were two very prominent Democrats look
ing for the office. One of them was the
Registrar of this City, against whom I
have nothinp to say personally. Mr.
Hinton was backed up by this paper, and
there was another young mats who was
likewise seeding that nomination. So far
JOSEPH P. KELLY, Who Told What He Knew of the "Examiner"
Last Night.
as Mr. Hinton is personally|concerned, I
believe he is a man of honesty and in
tegrity.
"On the other hand, his opponent bad
been and is to-day one of the warmest
lriends I have. He was a candidate for
that office, and when it came to a question
as to where my vote in the convention
should be cast there never was a doubt as
to how I would cast it. But before the
nomination had been ma<ie, before the
vote had actually been taken, a certain
clique of politicians waited on me for the
purpose of controlling my vote to secure
the nomination for Mr. Hinton. I ex
plained to them my situation with rela
tion to this friend of mine, and toid them
that under no circumstances could 1 heed
any proposition of that 'character.
"This clique was but the mouthpiece of
the Examiner, and when they found that
I would not under any circumstances vote
for their candidate, they told me then that
they woulcVsee I was defeated in my as
pirations for Congress. How faithfully
they redeemed their promise is borne out
by the fact that within six days the most
scandalous charges were preferred against
me in that paper. I then went before the
Grand Jury witn relation to those matters
and demanded an immediate investigation
of 'hem and demonstrated the utter and
complete falsity of the whole accusation.
Notwithstanding that I had produced the
proofs of my innocence, this paper is now
rehashing and republishing the same accu
sation of two years ag>, wbeo every man,
woman and child in the State of Califor
nia remembers I *ent into details in regard
to my connection with that matter and
proved that every single statement that
was made against me was absolutely and
wholly untrue. That is the fact. [Ap
plause.]
"There was another reason for this
paper's animosity toward me. This
reason I discovered within tbe last seven
months when it was shown that the Ex
aminer was subsidized by the Southern
Pacific Company. At the very time these
accusations were formulated against me
by that paper it was drawing $1000 a
month from the Southern Pacific Com
pany under a contract which it afterward
explained was one for advertising in its
columns. This contract was tbe subject
of correspondence &x late as September 29,
1894.
"Now I have here the statement that
this is a Democratic paper. I for one will
say that it has never been a Democratic
paper since it was under the control and
management of Philip A. Roach.
"In 1890, one of the most memorable
years in the State of California, what hap
pened? There was a distinguished native
son an aspirant for the highest oiiice in
the hands of the people. The moment
bis aspiration became public, the very in
stant that knowledge was acquired by
that paper, it at once commenced the
most vindictive kind of vituperation
against him. I refer to his record as a
living lie to what this paper stated at that
time, for this native son did secure the
flection, and be nas now a world-wide
reputation. I refer to the Hon. Stephen
M. White.
"Take the campaign of two years ago
and w nat do you find? You find that the
San Francisco Examiner, pretending to be
a Democratic paper, turned down the en
tire local ticket from top to bottom, with
the result that the local ticket, without
this paper and its support, was almost
in iis entirety elected. What ticket
did the San Francisco Examiner support?
The Examiner supported the Non-Parti
san ticket, with the result that the entire
vote it received was 2500, and every single
man who has ever been opposed "by that
paper, so far as his official career is con
cerned, has proven a true representative
of the interests of the people.
"Take another occasion in that same
campaign of 1894. I refer to the Railroad
Commissioners. A young distinguished
native son was elected in spite of the
most villainous charaes preferred against
him. But what has been his record during
the time he has been a member of that
commission? The vote of Dr. James I.
Stan ton, I say, is a living he to every accu
sation which that paper made against
him, and for the first time in the history
of the Railroad Commissionâ the first
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1896.
time it has ever been Democraticâ have
the people of the Slate of California se
cured some efforts at redress. ._
V So far as this paper is 'concerned with
relation to Dr. Stanton,' even after he had
been elected, they tried ; in '- all sorts >' of
ways to ruin his reputation." * , Â
The ; speaker ;- : then denied the charge
made by the Examiner that he was solicit
ing votes on the'; strength of the nation
ality of his father, and concluded his talk
on this theme by saying: .." ;.
'I have a record in mv family that is
different from that of Mr. Hearst's." Tnis
elicited ' long continued applause, and
one enthusiastic i admirer of r ; Mr. \ Kelly
called for three; cheers, which wore -given
with a vim. He then en ered into a long
recital of what he described as the disrep
utable private life of the Examiner's pro
prietor. [This The Call does not repro
duce, because it was not within the scope
of politics and moreover was not of a na
ture that The Call is willing to publish.]
He next referred to the character of ? some
of the advertisements in the Examiner's
columns as being disreputable | and inde
cent and declared that the advertising
columns of that journal should be in ac
cord with the high moral tone of some of
the mattei ; published ;i in its editorial col
umns.
Then, referring to the paper itself, he
spoke as follows: "It has been called the
â¢Monarch of the Dailies. ; It is the mon
arch of the dallies. But it is not the mon
arch of the dailies by a good deal in some
things â not in principle, not in stability
of: purpose, nor is t it a monarch of the
dailies so far as standing by the people;
but it is the monarch liar of the journals
and' fittingly deserves the designation
given to it by a weekly paper, which called
it the monarch of filth, folly and vice."
The speaker charged the Examiner with
mutilating reports of political meetings,
and some limes f omitting any mention of
them, because of his having taken part in
them. He also charged : the Examiner
with pandering to the lower instincts of
the people by 'its sensational method of
presenting news. r . â  , . :
Commenting on this he said:
"That shows you the character of this
paper; that, it has not and never has had
the true interests of this State at heart;
that it indulges in sensational journalism
to gather in the humble nickel. It re
mains for you to bring that paper to the
same level of decency that is held by every
respectable newspaper in the United States.
While you support this paper it will
continue to pander to the sentiments of
the lower natures. You should lake away
your advertising patronage and yon
should withdraw your subscriptions from
it."
Mr. Kelly aeain alluded to tbe $30,000
advertising contract which he said was
made between Mr. Hearst and the South
ern Pacific Company for the purpose of
controlling that paper's editorial columns
against attacks on the Southern Pacific
and all its interests.
Mr. Kelly asserted that the fusion
scheme was one concocted by the Exam
iner to fuse him cut of the fight. He
stated, however that he had been nomi
nated by the regular convention of the
Democratic party, and that he did not
propose to withdraw from the ti?ht under
any circumstances. He charged the fusion
committee, which consisted of six Demo
crats and six Populists, with having been
stuck with his personal political enemies,
and made the further charge that A. B.
Kinne, the candidate selected by this com
mittee, was a memDer of the A. P. A. He
read two affidavits substantiating his
charge, and which further stated that Mr.
Kinne was a member of Council No. 3.
He declared that he was not a railroad
man ; that his nomination was not secured
with the assistance of Jim Rea, aryi
pledged himself against the funding bill
or any measure looking to a compromise
of the debt of the Central Pacific Railroad.
He discussed the Democratic National
platform in detail, and announced him
self as in favor of every plank in that
declaration.

STRANGE CONDUCT
OF JUDGE BELCHER
Talks to a Jury in Behalf
of Judge Hebbard's
Candidacy.
Proceedings in the Chinese Mur
der Case Are Varied by a
Political Speech.
MAY LOCK THE JURORS UP.
They Were Asked by the Court to
Support the Candidate of the
Non-Parlisans.
If Judge Hebbard is not elected to the
bench again it will not be for lack of in
teresting novelties which have been intro
duced into the conduct of his campaign.
The most bizarre of these and one hith
erto wholly untried in these parts was de
veloped yesterday, when Judge Belcher
interrupted the trial of a murder case in
order to haraugue the jury in his behalf.
Mr. Buckley and Mr. Rainey, political
experts who have probably invented more
extraordinary methods of gathering votes
than any twenty men in the State, will no
doubt watch the effect of this experiment
with breathless interest.
When this jury is sent to its room at the
conclusion of the case to deliberate upon
its verdict the opportunity will present
itself to Judge Belcher to turn the key in
the lock and keep them there until they
promise â every one of them â to vote for
his favorite for Superior Judge.
He will never get a better chance to do
real "yeoman work" in politics. Certain
ly tbe members of the jury are not wholly
unprepared for such a move, and some of
them, who do not wish to vote for Judge
Hebbard unless compelled to do so by
some process of law of which they have
not hitherto been advised, are somewhat
alarmed.
Tbe trial of Woon Tuck Wo is being
heard before Judge Belcher, Department
11 of the Superior Court. Wo is the Chi
naman who is coarged with having shot
Lee Ti some weeks ago on Waverly place.
The prosecution concluded its presenta
tion of its case yesterday morning, and
Judge Ferral had just opened for the de
fense when the noon recess was taken.
Judge Belcher having given the usual ad
monition to the jury not to talk about the
case, requested tne twelve good men to
remain in their places after the recess bad
been declared, as he wished to speak to
them privately.
When the audience and witnesses had
departed, but while the counsel in the
case were still packing up their papers,
Judge Belcher stepped down from the
bench to the rail of the jury-box and
there began the fir-t speech of the cam
paign in behalf of his brother Judge.
Judge Belcher spoke in a low tone of
voice when he began, and the jurors, at
first wondering, leaned forward in their
places to hear what the court â for the
Judge was still the court to them, despite
the recess â had to say to a jury in private.
When they caught the drift of his re
marks their wonder turned to amaze
ment.
His Honor began by referring to the
candidacy of Judge Hebbard on the Non-
Partisan ticket. He said his repudiation
by the Republican convention was noth
ing less than a crying outrage. He de
clared quite hotly that this action was the
result of "certain influences" being
brought to bear against him, chiefly by
corporations that had no doubt been
offended by some of Judge Hebbard's de
cisions. He went on to say that Judge
Hebbard was all that he ought to be as a
wi<e, just and able Judge, and should re
ceive the support of every member of the
jury.
The address was an able campaign
effort, and consumed a very considerable
part of the time of the recess.
Several of the jurors were personally
known to the speaker, and some discus
sion followed on a familiar footing.
Others of the jury who were not per
sonally known to the Judge, and who had
no interest in what be was saying, took
their hats and left tbe courtroom while it
was still going on.
The names of the jury who were sub
jected to this experience were: August
Binsky, 312 Eady street; P. T. Dunn,
109 Guerrero street; T. C. Van Bib
ber, 1305 Polk; Washington Marion, 1817
Scott; H. C. Osmont, 320 a Fell; A. P.
Robbins, 1212 Geary; William A. Davies,
1032 JacKson; Frank McMullen, 1511
Jones; John N. Nolan, 722 Waller; J. S.
Franklin, 2929 California; E. P. Danforth,
1816 Vallejo; James Scott, 424 Ellis.
NO CONVICT -MADE GOODS
Prison Directors and Manufac
turers to Hold a Con
ference.
They Will Prepare a legislative Bill
Tbat Will Protect Free
> Labor.
The Board of State Prison Directors and
the directors of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association will hold a con
ference in the near future to come to an
understanding upon the subject of prison
made goods and the compilation of a bill
regulating the same that will be presented
to the next State Legislature.
Several months ago the prison directors
decided to increase the sphere of useful
ness of the convicts under their charge
by enlarging tbe jute plant so as to turn
out goods other than grain bags.
Tbe Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation bitterly opposed this on the
ground tbat it would materially interfere
with free labor and cause a competition
with local manufacturers.
This protest and the controversy that
followed brought to light tbe fact tbat
California is a dumping-ground for the
convict-made goods of a dozen or more
Eastern State prisons. This agitation
caused a bill to be prepared and placed be
fore Congress that will compel prison
authorities to brand all of their goods for
identification.
All of t is had its effect upon the Cali
fornia State Prison Directors, who have
manifested a disposition not to do anything
tnat will work an injury upon free labor
and local industries. The matter has
hung fire until the election of Julian Sonn
tap as president of tbe Manufacturers'
Association, and he took it up tigain in
earnest. He recently met Prison Director
Devlin, to whom be suggested the advisa
bility of the two bodies holding a meeting
and discussing the situation.
Mr. Devlin stated that at San Quentin
there are about 800 convicts who are able
to work and assist in the support of tbe
prison. He asked if these could be divided
among the trades. For example, 200 be
set to work making furniture, 200 making
shoes, and so on, and still leave a good
force at work in the jutemill. This ar
rangement, he believed, would not
seriously affect white labor and manufac
turers.
Mr. Sonntag was not in favor of the plan.
CHARTER ASSOCIATION.
Rapidly Gaining by the Addition of

The Citizens' Charter Association held

COLEMAN FOB McKINLEY
A Life -Long Democrat Prophe
sies That the Ohioan Will
Be Elected.
His Impressions Regarding the Politi
cal Sent ment in the Eastern
States.
"Fm a life-long Democrat, but I believe
in sound money, and hope McKinley will
be our next President."
Thus did William P. Coleman state his
political position Wednesday night. Mr.
Coieman has just reached this City on his
way to the Klamath Indian reservation,
whither he has been sent by the Govern
ment to settle tbe boundary disputes be
tween the whites and Indians.
"Yes, sir," continued Mr. Coleman,
"I'm what you call a goldbug Democrat
The goldbug Democrats in the East are
very numerous and will certainly con
tribute greatly to McKinley'a harvest of
votes."
When asked as to Presidential pros
pects in the East, Mr. Coleman became
cautious.
1 1 will risk expressing my conviction,"
he answered, "that McKinley will be
elected to tne Presidency.
"I base this conviction upon the feeling
which seems to prevail in the States. For
example, Maryland and West Virginia,
despite their large Democratic population,
are considered practically solid for Mc-
Kinley. According to the estimate of
several prominent statesmen in Washing
ton, Maryland's majority for McKinley
will be between 25,000 and 30,000.
"In Kentucky McKinley's chances are
at the very least equal to Bryan's, while
all the New England States will be prac
tically a unit for the Republican nominee.
In fact, with the exception of the South
ern States â exclusive of West Virginia
and Marylandâ l consider it safe to pre
dict that McKinley will carry the day in
all the States east of Illinois and Indiana.
"As to Illinois, I have found a division
of opinion. Tbe population is a mixed
one, politically speaking, and it is unsafe
to predict the result. My personal impres
sion is that the State will go for McKinley,
and that McKinley's chances are even
better in Indiana. Missouri will go Demo
cratic, with a majority of 2t>,000 or 30,000
for McKinley in the City of Su Louis. In
fact, it may be stated without fear of con
eradiction that throughout tne East a gen
tral confidence in McKinley'a election
prevails.
"As a consequence business is picking
up wonderfully. Only a few days ago we
beard of 10,000 or more idle men having
been put to work in the iron foundries of
Pennsylvania and the States near by.
That surely means something. It looks
as though the country were on the verge
of a better state of things.
"But I must stop," exclaimed Mr. Cole
man. "I did not intend to pose as a
prophet and do not wish to be repre
sented as so doing. After all, tbe vote of
the Nation's workingmen may go for
Bryan â at least so the Bryanites tell vs â
but between you and me I think the
Bryanites will find out on the 4th of No
vember that they have been terribly
fooled."
HILKOFF LEAVES.
The Russian Engineer Escorted by High
' Bailway Officials Eastward.
' Prince Michel Hilkoff, the Russian Im
perial Minister of Ways and Communica
tions, left San Francisco last evening with
his son on the homeward journey. In the
afternoon he was escorted' to the Union
Iron Works by Colonel C. F. Crocker, and
there he inspected the machine-shops and

Southern Pacific May Collect Local Fares
Tbe Supreme Court has decided the case
brought by E. G. Buswell to test the right of
the Southern Pacific Company to collect fares
within the city of Oakland, and the decision
is in favor of the Southern Pacific Company.
The court held that ii the Legislature had any
intention to prohibit the railroad company
from charging a fare it would have said so in
more exact words. This decision probably
establishes the right to collect fares also in
Alameda and Berkeley.
Prior to 1825 all women's shoes were
