Fifteen Thousand Visitors
Go to Canton in One
Short Day.
From Mills, Furnaces, Farms,
Colleges, Workshops, Mines
and Counting-Rooms.
ALL EAGER FOR PROTECTION

Visitors.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 3.â Fifteen thou-
Band men came from the mills, furnaces,
farms, colleges, workshops, mines and
â¢ counting-rooms of New York, Pennsyl
vania, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana, inarched
up the Market-street hill in Canton to-day
to see and hear Major McKinley, and they
marched down again with the flush of en
thusiasm in their faces and the promise of
victory in their ringing cheers.
Major McKinley surpassed himself to
day. He was engaged in the work of
meeting delegations from breakfast time
till after trie sun set and the lamps had
been lighted before the last delegation
marched away. He spoke to a greater
number of large bodies of voters, repre
senting a vast variety of interests and in
dustries, than he had before ad-tressed in
a single day. He made fourteen j formal
speeches and several informal ones and
talked to thirty delegations. The day was
superb, the air bracing and the sunshine
genial. ,
Two delegations arrived before 6 o'clock.
One came from Harrisburg, Pa., and num
bered more 300; the other from Sunday
CreeE Valley, in Athens County, Ohio,
part of the great Hocking Valley mining
region. The delegation of miners num
bered 600. In addressing the two delega
tions Major McKinley said in part:
Coming; as yon do from a city of great
rolling-mills and other manufactories buying
a product in value of. mure than $12,000,000
annual y when your establishments are all
running full time, and from one of the great
est manufacturing States in the country, I
need hardly be told of the deep and profound
interest which you have in the rightful settle
ment of the issues presented in this campaign.
Both of the leading issues are of sufficient im
. portance to your industrial life and prosperity
to command your unremitting labor and
effort. â¢ â¢_ i%
Government expenditures must not exceed
Government receipts. ''- THe creation of a pub
* lie debt in time of peace is only justified in
TSustalning the credit of the Government and
the public honor, but It should not be con
tinued . a moment longer - than the Congress
whose duty, it is to. rais; the revenue shall
make provision to supply it. [Applause.] No
one has suffered more nnder these conditions
than the farmers of the United States. [Ap
plause.] They have lost much by a diminished
home market, and have suffered in the foreign
market by the â¢ repeal of the reciprocity pro
visions of the tariff law of .1890.
The foreign market opened by reciprocity
during the administration of President Harri
son must be reopened and the home market
must be reopened, improved and preserved for
the American larmer, while the American
workshop shall be opened to the American
workmen. [Great applause.] No patriotic cit
izen should object to regaining end then hold
ing our proud rank of the greatest manufac
turing, mining and farming Nation of the
world. [Applause.]
With me the necessity of the restoration of a
judicious and wise American tariff policy is a
firm conviction second to nothing in import
ance except the preservation of law and order,
wh'ch we must have. [Great cheerln?]. Of
justice and domestic tranquillity and the pres
ervation of our credit, our currency and our
National honor. [Great applause.]
Major McKinley made his second speech
to the Wheelmen's McKinley and Hobart
Republican Club of Buffalo, which arrived
on a special train at 10:15. There were 150
members in the party. Major McKinJey
excused himseif from making a formal
speech, for the . reason that he was
scheduled to address all of the wheelmen
in a body later in the day.
Following the Buffalo wheelmen came a
delegation of 450 employes of the Standard
Manufacturing Company of Pittsburgh F.
J. Torrance, spokesman for this delega
tion, said most of the men in it were
Democrats who proposed to cast their first
Republican vote this year. Six men bore
on a gilded platform a beautiful porcelain
V^'-htub decorated with and mounted in
gold, which was presented by the Stand
ard Company to Major MoKinley. Major
McKinley's speech was impromptu and
uncommonly spirited.' f i<
While the major was speaking a delega
tion â¢ from Barborton, Ohio, 300 strong
marched up to the house and marched
into the yard. As soon as Major McKin
ley finished his remarks O. C. Barbor, the
great matchmaker, introduced the delega
tion of his employes and Major McKinley
addressed them very briefly.
Five hundred workingmen 'tiy >; the
Alleghany shops of the Pennsylvania lines
pressed closely behind the Barborton dele
gation, and Major McKinley scarcely had
time to sit down before the railroad men
massed i bemselyes in front of the porch.
W. ft. Kirker was , the spokesman. - The
major made a brief to this delegation and
seven minutes after concluding his re
marks was bowing to a new audience.
There were upward of 500 men in it, and
they came from thÂ« works of Mclntosh,
Hemphill & Co. and the Star Tin Plate
Company ;of 'Pitts burg. The men
brought with them the largest sheet of tin
plate in the world. Major McKinley ex
plained to them the benefits of the pro
tective tariff, and his remarks were punct
uated throughout by enthusiastic applause
and cheering. The seventh â¢ speech of the
day was a short one to a delegation of 100
employes of the Pittsburg and Western
Railroad.
I' At 12:30 o'clock a delegation 2000 strong
trim Washington County, : Pa., Â» arrived.
IÂ« was composed of farmers, ironworkers
and tin-plate makers. Major McKinley
said in part:
The wisdom of the statesmanship of Hamil
ton and Blame was unheeded in ; 1892. They
have not only deprived our agriculturalists of
the protection they had against the importa

tlon of foreign wool, livestock and farm prod
ucts, not only taken from the farmers the
benefits of reciprocity and new outlets for
their surplus products, but they now seriously
propose to pay them for the lessened quantity
they can sell at lessened prices in the home
market in dollars of depreciated value and
cheat you in quality under their financial
policy, as free trade has cheated you in quan
tity. [Great applause.]
General Grant, in bis annual message to
Congress in 1870, said: "If it means a failure
to provide necessary means to defray all the
expenses of the Government and therefore re
pudiation of the public debt and pen-dons,
then I am etill more opposed to such kind of
revenue reform." [Great cheering.] So must
all agree that if free silver is to add, as it will
undoubtedly add, to agricultural, manufactur
ing and commercial distress, now so severe in
all parts of the country, then we are more than
ever opposed to it and to accepting the other
delusion of false finance. [Applause and cries
of "We won't do It."]
At 1 o'clock Market street was filled
with delegations as far as the eye could
reach. They were massed all the way
down the hall under tbe great white arch
and stretched out ior a mile to the far
thest railway s'ation. The ninth speech
was made to 600 railroad men from Fort
Wayne, Ind., together witb a delegation
from Cleveland comprising employes of
the American Wire Company, of the
Harbon-Walker Fire-brick Company, of
the Oil-well Supply Company of Pitts
bury, of the Pittsburg Nail Works, of the
Cleveland Hardware Company and the
Kiiby Company. Major McKinley said :
I almost despair of being able to make my
self heard to this great assemblage of my
countrymen. You come from different States,
but with a single purpose, and that to satisfy
your devotion to the principles of the great
Republican party. [Applause.] Parties do not
make issues; issues make parties. Men who
think alike act together. This vast crowd
thinks alike, and they propose to act together
on the 3d day of November. [Tremendous ap
plause.] We have not only tne best manufac
tories and the best railroads and the most of
them, but we have the best money in the
world. [Continuous yello .]
We have more gold in the United States than
any other Governments except France and
Germany; we have more silver than any other
Government except India and China. Every
dollar we have, gold or silver, is worth 100
cents wherever trade goes and in every mart
and market place of the world. Now what we
want to do is to get back what we lost in 1892.
[Great applause.] Are you all agreed as to
that? [Cries of "We are" and "You bet"]
Nobody seema to be satisfied with what was
done in 1892. Those who helped to do it and
th se who are against it are alike dissatisfied
What we want is to return to the normal
prosperity of tbe United States.
The next delegation numbered 1000 and
came from Venango County, Pa. Adclega
tion of 100 students from Wooston (Ohio)
College marcbed op at the same time.
The candidate addressed tne two delega
tions in a few felicitous words and then
received 700 members of the Union
Veterans' Patriotic League of Pittsbnrg
and Allegliany County. The old soldiers
brought with tuem a score of battle
scarred and tattered flag*. Major Mc-
Kinley address d the veternns in patriotic

which was massed in tbe streets before
him. Major McKinley received from a
committee representing the mechanics
and silversmiths of tbe Mauser Manufac
turing Company of New York a handsome
silver vase. The speech ot presentation
was made by George Dessauer.
Major McKinley responded with a few
pleasant remarks. A-long'line of wheel
men, radiant in costumes of gray and
with brilliant pennants, came swiftly by a
few moments later. There were wheel
men in large numbers from Pittsburg,
Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago. Cincinnati
and other points. Mnjor McKinley ad
dressed tbe wheelmen as follows:
You are very welcome to my home. Politi
cal clubs on wheels are novel in poll tical con
tests and are truly American. Their presence
marks a new era in campaign work, and I
congratulate you upon the inauguration of
PATHWAY OF THE DESTRUCTIVE FLORIDA STORM.
The storm swept across the State in a northeasterly direction from Cedar Keys on the Gulf coast to Fernandina on the Atlantic side, with a breadth of over forty mile 3.
Over twenty-five towns have been completely destroyed or nearly so, aud nearly every ono In the whole area visited has sustained greater or less damage. The pin.
forests and the turpentine interests, which are very numerous in this section of the State, have been almost entirely destroyed. Wiien it is remembered that there is not an
elevation of 100 feet in the whole fc-tate of Florida some idea can be formed of the advantage the wind had and the tremendous velocity it could acqnire in such a country. It
is not an unusual thing for the coasts along the Gulf to be inundated by the wind piling up tbe waters against them, as was the case in Galveston in 1870, when the whole
island was under water, and on the Indianola coast in the early '80's, wnen the waters went inland over sixty miles along a strip 200 miles lone. Cedar Keys is situated on
one of the low islands that skirt the whole Gulf coast just below the mouth of the Suwanee River. No part of the island is over eight feet above the level of the water, and
the wave, which gained great velocity coming from the deeper to the shallow water, swept through the town and along the adjacent coasts with a terrible force.

EVIDENCES OF A TRAGEDY

ST. LOUIS, Mo., dct. I.â Sidrtt.^g news ,
has-been telegraphed here about what
appears to be the bloodiest tragedy ever
occurring in Arkansas. ' The scene of the
supposed crime is ;at Duvals Bluff, Ark.
Living there for some years .past was a
prominent farmer named Bud % Chiiffin.
He was married and had five > children.
Some months ago a man named John King
applied to him. for work. Cbaffin ;; liked
the looks of King and promptly hired him.
' ..! It was not ; long, however, . before it was
noticed by g the : neighbors that King and
Mrs. Chaffin appeared to be more friendly |
than a due respect -to the proprieties
would admit. ' King seemed to be in her
company all the time. *
It is believed that the husband sus
pected this and ordered King to leave the
farm. Since September 21 Cliaffln, his
wife, the Gve children and King have been
missing. The neighbors tbou^ht nothing
was wrong at first, but when the days
rolled by and no news was heard of the
absent people it was decided to make an
investigation.
A searching party was organized and a
thorough search of the premises was made.
To the horror of the neighbors blood was
found spattered over the floors and walls
of the building.
No bo* lies, however, were found. It is
cow believed that King and Mrs. Chaffin
killed Chaffin and the children and then
eloped.
"TERRIBLE EVENTS" THREATENED
Armenian Revolutionsis Issue a Warning
Which a Leader Declares Amounts
to Nothing.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Oct. 3.â
On Thursday, October 1, the foreign
diplomats received from the Armenian
revolutionists a third threat of an Ar
menian demonstration. In the comumni
cation conveying the threat the revolu
tionists declared that "terrible events"
would soon take place. The leader of the
Armenian revolutionary committee, in
reply to questions about the threat, says it
must have emanated from some of the
weaker revolutionary societies, which are
totally unable to carry out its menace.
The Huntchakist party, he says, had
nothing to dv witb it, and is not prepared
to take any action beyond the private re
moval of certain persons by assassination.
Otherwise, he says, the Hnntchakists will
await events.
The Porte is negotiating with the Arme
nian revolutionary committee, with a vu j w
of obtaining the cessation of outrages
on the part of the revolutionists, promis
ing, in return, to sanction the election of
a new Armenian patriarch, tc grant een
eral amnesty to Armenian political offend
ers and effect reformers in all the Asiatic
provinces. Nobody believes in the good
faith of the Porte in making these prom
ises.
From what is generally accepted as a
reliable source of information, it is re
ported here that an entente has been had
between Russia ami England in regard to
Turkey.
PARIS, Prance, Oct. 3.â The women of

WILLIAM MORRIS IS DEAD.
Was One of England's Greatest Poets and
Could Have Secured the Laure
ateship.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 3.â William Mor
ris, the celebrated English poet, died this
morning. He was 72 years old.
The peaceful death of William Morris
to-day is one of the gieatest blows suffered
by English poetry since Tennyson passed
away. It was well known that Morris
might have had the laureateship had it
pleased him to modify certain polical
Opinions not in favor in court circles,
but those who knew him best are well
aware that he loosed on this post as that
of a glorified Government lackey, which
by some chance bad been filled by two
great men. Morris would have none of it
any price. He was a great, strong, gener
ous creature, skilled in many arts and
crafts, impulsive and ever working. It is
d.fficult to believe that this fine ruddy
man, more like a seaman than an artist
and rrote t and wbo looked tbe picture of
health, is no longer living. It is all the
more difficult because his new tale, "The
Well at the World's End," was published
by Longman only yesterday.
EXPLOSION OF A MAGAZINE.
Five White Men and Scores of Kaffirs
Killed in a Fearful Disaster at
Buluwayo.
BULUWAYO, Sooth Africa, Oct. 3.â A
:>owder magazine exploded here to-day
with disastrous results. Five white men
were kiLed, as were also scoies of Kaffirs,
who were camping near the magazine.
Most of the latter were killed by fulling
rocks that had formed the walls of the

were injured, many of them having their
arms or legs torn from tneir bodies.
A large proportion of the injured are

Governor Black Speak for

IDLE TALK OF A NEW DAWS
Bourbons Who Fear the B ection of
McKm ey and a Repeal of the
Wilson Tariff Law.
ST. LOUIB, Mo., Oct. aâ Beautiful
autumn weather greeted the delegates
and visitors to the second quadrennial
convention of the National Association of
Democratic Clubs wnicb assembled in tbe
Auditorium building this morning. The
spacious structure was profusely decorated
with flags, banners and banting, inter
spersed with pictures ot men celebrate i
in the history of the Democracy. A
notable exception in the gallery of Dor
traits was the bust of President Cleve
land's well-known lithograph.
Early this morning the members of the
executive committee wbo are in attend
ance at the convention met and formally
ratified the programme of tbe proceedings
as prepared by Secretary McKean. At
11:15 o'clock not more than 1000 people
were inside the building, and tne orders
were given to throw op-n the galleries to
any who might desire to enter.
At 11:25 o'clock Vice-President Steven
son entered the nail leaning on tbe arm
of ex-Governor Black of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Stevenson limped perceptibly and
showed the effect of the injuries at the
collapse of the platform at Burlington,
lowa. At 11:45 o'clock Secretary McKean
called the convention to order and the
Jefferson Glee Club, accompanied by the
band, played the National anthem "Amer
ica." Mr. Black was greeted with a round
of applause.
In calling the convention to order, Black
said that the cause they were supporting
was that of no section and no class, but of
the w. Ole people. Only one class, he
declared, was not represented at the con
vention, and that was the few who repre
sented the syndicates, trusts and other
combinations.
"Mr. Bryan," said the speaker, "stands
for the republic, for tbe continued rule of
the people, for independence of our
country, for tbe right of man to
live and labor for .Mmself and for
his children. We therefore all propose
to stand shoulder to shoulder with
all men who will stand with us, and
never was a welcome more heartfelt than
t at which we extend to oar silver
brethren and our Populist brethren, who
have magnanimously imperiled many
things most dear to them that they might
come with us to save our common country
and rescue i umanity itself from the fate
which our powerful opponents have pre
pared for it. With the election of Mr.
Bryan and a people's Congress we can look
forward to the dawn of a new country
under brighter auspices and approaching
another golden age of peace, plenty and
prosperity like that which followed the
election of Jefferson."
At the conclusion of his speech Vice-
President Stevenson was introduced. He
spoke in part as follows:
I fully appreciate the honor of having been

selectert by your committee to preside over the,]
opening session of this convention of Demo
cratic clubs. For the great work you have ac
complished and are yet to a< complish in
bringing victory to our standard you will
have the gratitude of the Democrats every
where. The gravity of the Issues involved in
the pending political struggle cannot be over
stated. Their supreme importance to the
masses of our people cannot be measured by
words. I make no question as to the nonest
convictions of those who give their support to
the ticket nominated at tbe IndianapoiU con
vention. The fact remains, however, that the
contest for the Presidency rests soieiy be
tween Brvan and McKiniey. It cannot be
claimed that any other candidate has a sem
blance of chance for success or even that he
will receive a single electoral vote. It will
avail nothing to close our eyes to the fact that
the gentlemen I have named are the real can
didates before the people.
It must rje remembered that during the
thirty-two years Immediately preceding the in
auguration of President Cleveland on the 4th
of March, 1893, there was no single moment
that ihe Drinocratic party controlled the
Presidency and both houses of Congre;.s; never
a mordent that it couid piuce a single law
upon the statute-books. For all of the legisla
tion during tbat period, which Lrousht iti its
train financial disaster "monopolies" and
"truits," the Republican party is alone re
sponsible. During the p n riod I have indi
cated the monetary poiicy of the founders of
our Government w-is abandoned and silver
demonetized. The sad results to all kinds of
business, to all conditions of men, that have
followed "as tli e night the day" the demone
tization act ol 1873 have never boen, will
nevtr be, adequately told. Something of the
evils that have followed in its train can be
lound in the enforced idleness of those who
vainly seek employment, in the wrecked tor
tunes of men once prosperous in business and
in the deplorable condition of the finances of
the Nation.
But we are told that the real issueâ that
upon which this election is to turnâ is not the
monetary but the tariff question. Our od
ponents place this in the very forefront of the
struggle. Meeting them for a momeut upon
their chosen ground, judging from tuÂ«ir past
history, what Â«re their promises, what their
Intentions in the event of success ? The nomi
nation at St. Louis oi the distinguished author
of the last Republican tariff law emphasizes
the determination of our opponents wheu in
the full tide of power to re-enact the McKiniey |
tariff, and restore to our statute-books the most
unjust, the most odious tar ff schedules known
to any period of our iiistory.
Without going into details as to the in
creased cost of articles of daily consumption,
you will remember how under the McKiniey
law year by year there was a decrease iv tbe
revenues oi the Government. Tbe Republicans
came into power on the 4th of March, 1889,
heir to all that bad been achieved by four
ychrs of successiu! Democratic administration.
The treasury was overflowing; tie question
was, "What shall be done with the surplus ?"
Four years later the heritage of the incoming
Democratic administration irom its Republi
can predecessor was a depleted treasury ; busi
ness was paralyzed; workshops closed, wage
earners in enforced idleness and poverty and
want the common lot. Under the conditions I
have named the Democratic Congress ad
dressed itself to the task of making good its
promises made in the campaign of 1892, to re
form thj tariff and reduce to the people the
cost of tbe necessaries of life. The McKiniey law
was repealed anxl the Wil-on biil placed upon
the statute-books. It should never be forgotten
that this tariff billâ the first lor flay years en
acted In tne interest of tlie people â was passed
after a desperate str uggle. Since tbe re j eal of
the corn Imws in England, the world has wit
nessed no such parliamentary struggle against
monopoly and privilege. It was Uierallv a
struggle of the people against the monopoly 1
and greed iostered and made powerful by more
than thirty years of .Republican legislation.
The "combinations" and "trusts," now the
curse of the American people, bave on.y been
made possible by the bad tinancial legislation
and the high protective tariffs whioh have en
riched the lew at the expense of the many.
The return of tbe Republican party to power
means the repeal oi the Wilsou tariff law. It
means the re-enactmeut of the McKmlcy law,
or one even yet more odioils in its provisions.
ThÂ« financial question, however, overshadows
all others in the present contest. Believing
as I do that gold and silver find equal recogni
tion in the constitution of the United States,
that by their joint u?e in effecting exchange
and performing the other functions of money
we have prospered in the past, and that the I
cvii days now befalling us are in uo small
measure the result of the demonetization of
silver, I have no hesitation in maintaining my |
party allegiance and casting my vote for |
Bryan and Se wall, the nominees of the Demo
cratic convention. ,
1 deeply regret that many of those with
whom I have been associated in former con
tests now oppose the selection of the candi
dates nominated in accordance with the time
honored methods and usages of the Demo
cratic party. Without questioning their sin
cerity, the inquiry is significant: What ,s
there in the attitude of the Democratic party
upon the monetary question to justify its j
abandonment by those wlio have long shared i
in its counsels, and who have been the re- i
dpients of its rewards and its honors? As toe
"parting of the ways" has been reached, it i-s
well to inquire: *Is their pa:h or is ours the
true one? Are we recreant to Democratic
faith nnd tradition in standing by the historic !
organization, or they in ai>:iug directly or In- i
directly in the tiiumph ot its great antagonist?
By tbe constitution of the United States, the I
Congress is vested with the sole power "to coin j
money, reeulate the value thereof and of |
foreign coins, and fix the standard of weights .
and measures." and it is further provided that j
"no State shall coin money, or make anything j
but gold and silver coin a tender in payments
of debts." ThÂ» system of bimetallism is here I
established. Gold and silver coin here find
equal recognition.
As Democrats we believe in honest money,
the money of the constitution. We attaca
deep importance to the words of Thomas Jef
ferson, "I concur with you tnat the unit must
Hand upon both metals." It was daring the
administration of Washington that tbe great
Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton '
said: "To annul the use of either of the two i
metals as sound mouey is to abridge tne quan
tity of the circulating medium and is liable to
all the objections that arise from a comparison
of tbe benefits of a full, with the evils of a
Bcant circulation." Have we in tbe advocacy
of bimetallism depar'ed from Democratic
teachings, from the Democratic faith on this
question?
Mr. Btevenson then went on to thow
that the Democratic platform of 1880 de
clared for honest money, "consisting of
gold and silver and paper convertible into
coin on demand." And in 1884 Mr. Cleve
land was nominated ana subsequently
elected upon the declaration, "We believe
in honest money, the gold and silver coin
age of the constitution and the circulating
medium convertible into such money
without loss." la 1888 the platform ot
the 'an preceding convention was unani
mously reaffirmed, and in 1892 the plat
form declared for "the use of both gold
and silver as a standard money of the
country." Mr. Stevenson continued:
This declaration met the earnest approval
then as it does now. Can it be that tnose of
us wbo four years later still bold to tbe use of
both metals as standard money of the coun
try heve abandoned the faith and are no
longer worthy to be called Democrats? Is it
too much to claim tha; in giving our support
to the nominees of the Chicago convention we
are keeping the faith? The charge of recre
ancy to our party does not lie at our doors. It
is well to inquire now what has been and
what is the attitude of ihe Republican party
upon this question. The finmiciMl plank of
the Republican party in 1892 declared for
bimetallism and for the use of both gold and
silver as a standard money. la 1892 both
parties favored bimetallism and demand
ed gold ana silver as the standard money of
the country. The Republican platform of
1896 is a departure from tnni of 189-. It
reads: "We are, therefore, opposed to the free
coinage of silver except by i:.ter;;a;ional
agreement with tbe leading comm rcial na
tion-- of the world, which we pledge ourselves
to promote, and until such an agreement can
be obtained tne existing gold standard must
be preserved."
Here we have an explicit declaration for the
gold standard. This is an undisguised declar
ationâthe first of any National convention â iv
favor of gold as our sole siaudard money.
By this declaration tlie Republican party
stands pledged to the maintenance at all haz
ards of the g.iLd standard unless by interna
tional agreement the iartre commercial na
tions of the world will consent to returu to
bimetallism, in what party platform at any
period of our history catj there be so humili
ating a proposition? Did the Republican lead
ers who formulated that declaration really
â¢xpect England, "the leading commercial na
tion of the world," to consent to an interna
tional agreement looking to the ra-establish
ment of bimetallism in the two great Engli-.h
tpeaking nations? Or was this proposition
simply to placate tnd keÂ«Din line until nfter
the election such members of the party as still
believed the interests of the people could be
best subserved by the use of tne two precious
metals as standard money? I repeat the in
quiry of onr cand.'dHte for tbe Presidency : "If
the gold standard is the test, if it is desirable,
why even this thought of a change?"
Why even the suggestion oi an international
agreement? Why humble ourselves at the feet
of Kngiond that she may consent to something
that wiil not redound to our benefit as a peo
ple? This clause of the Republican platform
U a confession of weakness. Either tbe single
gold standard fa the best for our country or it
To not. If it is the best why ask the consent of
England or any other nation that bimetallism
be restored? If nor, if iv maintenance bodes
evil and that only evil to our country, why
fchall not our Governmentâ the greatest the
world has ever known â take the lead in ac
complishing what the Republican platform by
implication admits should be done? In a
word, is not the clause in the Republican piat
form looking to international agreement a
feeble confession that a return to bimetallism
isdesirnble?
lam firmly persuaded that in all the pres
ent contest tne intorests ol the peop'e are
bound up iv the success of the Democratic
party, wbosa creed upon the pending vital
issue was the living faith of the founder* of
our Government. Now, as in the struggles of
the past, its appeal is to the judgment, the
patriotism, the sense of justice of the Ameri
can people. Its candidate for the Presidency
is the able and eloquent statesman wbose
words have cheered tlie despondent, given
hope and inspiration to his countrymen, and
whose inauguration will be the earnest of bet
ter days to the Republic.
At the conclusion of Vice-President
Stevenson's address Governor Stone came
down the aisle to the speaker's platform,
leaning on the arm of ex-Governor Fisb
bace of Arkansas. The delegates threw
their hats iii the air, while the band
played "Dixie." Governor Stone, in few
and appropriate words, welcomed tho
delegates to Missouri. Governor Stone
was interrupted by the query: "What's
the matter with Stone?" and tbe unan
imous response of "He's all right."
Then three oheers were proposed for
Governor Altgeld of Illinois. These were
accorded a hearty response. Secretary
Gardiner read a number of letters from
secretaries of Democratic clubs through
out the Middle and West m and Southern
States, in which it was stated that the
free-silver element was predominant iv
their localities.
The committee on credentials, perma
nent organization, finance, resolutions,
etc., were then app inted and the conven
tion took a recess until 3 'p. M. At the
afternoon session the permanent officers
of the convention were selected as fol
lows: Chairman, E. D. Money of Missis
sippi; secretary, John Baker White of
West Virginia; assistant secretary, J. A.
Kane of Indiana.
Mrs. Ainsworth, president of the
Woman's League of Bryan and Kewali
Clubs, was introduced to the delegates,
and made a stirrine address on behalf of
her sex, urging tne delegates to use their
efforts toward the organization of women
clubs tnroughout the United States. Her
address was frequently applauded.
J. Kelly, representing the college boys
of the United States, as president of the
Association of Colle c Clubs, also made an
address to tne assembled delegates, which
was heartily applauded.
The committee on resolutions was then
called on to report, and C. S. Collins of
Arkansas read the loliowine declaration
of principles:
The National Association of Democratic
Clubs and silver clubs ot the United states in
National convention, do declare:
Firstâ That Me approve and ratify the plat
form of principles and declaration of pur
poses adopted by the Democratic party in
National Convention at Chicago, and we ap
prove and indorse specifically each separate
plank thereof, assured that when maiie the
ruling chart of Federal administration and
legislation it will relieve the peopie of the
pressing and increasing bnrdens of mono
metallism, low prices and business depression,
restore the ancient and natural conditions
necessary to a return of general prosperity
and exhibit the sovereign power as well as
the stern purpose oi the American people to
regulate the nuances and all concerns of this
Hi public, without waiting lor the consent of
any other nation on earth.
â Secondâ That events since the promulgation
of tuat new doctrine of American industrial
and financial independence have demon
strated the wisdom ol the action then taken,
and then, as the immediate consequence in
that jubt and tiuthful arraignment of plu
tocracy and the boldest assertion of the rights
of the common people, hitherto abus d and
pillaged under policies devised by the few for
ihe benefit of the few at the expense oi the
many, we have beheld tl c rapid and open as
sociation of every class unduiy favored by
monopolistic lav s, of every rapacious combine,
of every insatiable trust and every great oor
poration wuich defies public regulation for
public protection in one mighty conspir
acy, under a single absolute and fairly
typical boss, resoived with the aid of their
English and other foreign associates, by their
unlimited use of money and tueir unlimited
power of co-operation over a great mass of
citizens in their services and subject to injury
more or less directly at their hends, defeat the
people's candidate, to overthrow the people's
cause and to hoid the mas.-. . s in bondage to
the consolidated money power and to the con
tinuously appreciating single standard gold
dollar, starving its millions to fatten its few.
Thirdâ That it is a matter of public notoriety
nnd common observation â the facts being pat
ent to allâ that with few ana honorable excep
tions the managers of the various railway sys
tems, many of them grown enormously weal
thy through opportunities and practices well
understood, regarding only their individual
interests and that of tbe plutocracy to which
they personally belong, ignoring the protests
of shareholders, employers and the people,
have united to exert all the power ot all
their several corporations, created by pub
lic authority lor the accommodation of
public business, to coerce the electors
in tceir service to support the candidate
of the combined domestic monopolies and of
the international gold trust, by systematic
misrepresentations and seductions on tne
one band and intimidations on the other, so
that at this hour many thousands of the most
intell-igent citizens of this Republic, peculiar
ly and specially interested in the re-toration
of papular rule, are put to the desperate
choice of surrendering their suffrages to the
control of ethers asserting industrial mastery
iv politics, or losing their- jobs and the daily
bread 01 their families. That they in concert and
in expectation ot a colossal plan of operation
in support of the single gold standard and
monopolistic combination nave entered upon
a system of arbitrary coeicion and unjust dis
crimiuation in rates of transportation against
three great National parties, granting one rate
to the monopolists and another to their oppo
nents; one rate to tbe opulent attendants
upon the gold standard Indianapolis conven
tion and another to the delegates and visitors
to tbe great popular gatheiin? here assem
bled; one rate to Canton, where unwilling
men are shipped in trainluad^, and another
and almost prohibitory rate to otner gather
ings in the interest of the ('nicago platform
an-i is candidates, thus ruling at least half
of the people of the United States eff their
own highways, unless they choose to travel
upon grossly unjust and urn qual terms.
We ask the American people to record their
judgment on this corporate aggression at the
forthcoming National elecion. and we call
upon the proper authorities of the Federal
Government and of the State governments to
note these notorious, undenied and criminal
abuses of power in order that the laws vvhuh
grant equal rights upon the public highways
sliail be decently enforced, and the individual
offenders prosecuted and adequately pun
ished.
Fourthâ That we ratify the nomination of
William Jennings Bryan and Arthur Sewa.l
for President and Vice-President of the United
States, and we Diedpe them the united and
earnest support of tbe clubs represented in
this body. As American citizens, arising
above all partisan considerations and looking
on:y to tne gravity of the crisis now upon us
as a people, involving as we be
lieve, the financial liberties of the
sons of those who scaled the slopes of
Bunker Hill and camped with Washington
at Valley Forge and those nhose sacred duty
it is 10 transmit to our children and to the
world the liberties bonght by the blood of our
father. We send greetings to our brethren in
the Nation and ask them to join us in pledg
ing tbe ei.forcement of the new declaration
of independence now being tested in the
arena of American judgment and to sound
with us tbe National cnarge upon the foes of
humanity massed against us in this contest.
The following resolution was adopted:
Baolvrd, That the executive committee of
this convention be instructed to urge the clubs
represented in this convention and all those
ttffili-. ting with us to use tbeir best endeavors
as clubs end individuals to swell the New York
Journal's campaign fund, thus enabling tbe
party to take tuli ndvantageof the generous
and patriotic ten-ier of Wiiliam R. Hearst to
double each contribution made by the people
for the benefit of the people.
The following was also adopted:
Resolved, That it is ttie sense of this conven
tion that Indian Territory should be accorded
the same ' representation in Congress as otner
States.
The convention then took a recess until

WILLIE ARRIVES.
Candidate Bryan Talks About Jef-
f arson and Silver to a Very
Large Audience.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 3.â Candidate
William J. Bryan was to-night welcomed
by cheers from 17.000 throats at the Audi
torium, where he addressed, officially as
it were, the delegates of the National
Democratic clnbs, now in session, but
really an outpouring; of the people of St.
Louis. At 7:30 p. m. the doors of the build
ing Were surrounded by a crowd of at least
5000. The pressure was so great that trie
sergeant-at-arms was ordered to open the
doors of the building to the pubiic and in
less than ten minutes the entire Audi
torium was failed. The crowd wo* so great
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1596.
that the police force was inadequate to the
emergency.
At 8:30 p. m. the crowd had become so
demonstrative tbat Governor-elect Jones
of Arkansas responded to the clamor of
the audience and delivered an address in
favor of the silver standard. When Mr.
Bryan appeared the scene became ram
pant and it was some time before he was
able to proceed. He spoke in part as
follows:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemenâ For
just a little while I ask your attention. Ido
not require much time '.o say all I have to say
to you to-night. The clubs can be of more ser
vice now than in previous campaigns, because
this campaign is being run by the people
themselves. The clnbs have adopted a button
which presents the likeness of Thomas Jeffer
son. [Applause.] If you had searched through
all history you could not have lound a man
more worthy of being taken as an ideal states
man, becaue in all the history of the human
race there has never been but one Thomas Jef
ferson. [Applause.] Oi all tne constructive
statesmen whom the world has ever seen,
Thomas Jefferson stands first. At a time when
representative government was an experiment,
he wrote that immortal document which de
clared that all men are created equal, that
they are endowed with inalienable rights, that
governments are instituted to preserve those
rights and that governments derive their just
powers from the consent of tbe governed.
[Applause.] In stating these four propositions
he stated the Alpha and Omega of Democracy.
[Applause.]
Men may write books and men may fill li
braries with volumes, but they cannot im
prove upon that statement, recorded in a few
sentences and comprehensively, that there is
government of the people, for the people and
by the people. [Applause.] In xny judgment,
no statesman ever lived who so fully under
stood human nature as Jefferson did. No one
more fully understood the capacity of the peo
ple for seif-government; no one more lully un
derstood the dangers to be guarded against.
He stated the principles which underlie
Democracy, and then he applied those princi
ples to every question that arose daring his
time.
Tne greatest dancer which a government
has to fear when trusted to human bands is
favoritism. Favoritism is the curse of all gov
ernments. [Applause.] Least among govern
ment! like ours, and yet favoritism is the
dangerous strength even in our Government,
because our Government is administered
through human beings and human beings are
human.
My friends", if you would have government
just, if you would have government to fill the
ideal of a perfect government, you must have
a government that is no respecter of persons,
a government which deals with an equal
hand, a government which gives to none,
which takes from none, and a government
which in tne administration of law and justice
treats all alike and punishes the great as it
does the petty scoundrel.
If you ask me what is my highest ambition, I
will say that above all offices that human
hands can give, above all honors which confi
dence and esteem can bestow, if I could choose
the name by whioh I should be known, I would
choose it thus: That I have done my best to
make the Government what Thomas Jefferson
desired it should be.
My friends. Government has drifted away
from the old landmark. In times of passion,
in times of selfishness, the instrumentalities of
Government have been turned to private gain,
and Government instead of meting out equal
and exact justice, has been a refuge of those,
â who having obtained positions, hitve used it
to enrich themselves out of the toil and sweat
of their fellow-men. [Applauss.J
Behind the bu'warkserected by our oppo
nents have been gathered every public enemy
who preys uj.on the people. And they can
call to their aid but a small proportion of the
unjust gains that they have wrung from the
publicâ but a smHll proportion of those gainsâ
and yet that small proportion will be a cor
ruption fund, the like ot which was never be
fure known in any government on the face of
the earth. (Applause.]
Against this enemy, armed with all the Im
plements of party warfare, against this enemy
supplied with all the material that is sup
posed to be val uable in such a conflict against
tne enemy confident, arrogant and insolent,
we have nothing to oppose except the con
sciences of seventy millions of people. [Ap
plause.]
My friends, those who live fifty years from
now, reading the pages of history, will envy
those who lived in this'day of such wonderful
opportunity. I was born after the war. I be
long to that generation which has never had an
opportunity to prove its love of country upon
the bat;!efield, but, oh! my countrymen, never
in the history of this country has there been
such an opportunity for the citizen to pro*e
his love, not only of his country, but of man
kind and of his God, as there is to-day. [Great
applause.]
Show me a people oppressed; show me a
man who has suffered from injustice; show me
a man who has been made the victim ot legis
lation, and I wiil show you a man wnose
heart poes out to us in this conflict. [Ap
phase.]
Show me a king who is jealous of every
right bis subjects have; show me a man who
has no thirst except the thirst for gold; show
me a man that lives by opposition to his fel
low men anywhere, and I will show you peo
ple who are standing by and begging that
success may come to those who are opposed to
us. [Great applause.]
As the Presidential nominee of the people's
alliance, I want to say to you that I do not de
sire the involuntary support of any citizen
of this Nation. We appeal to the will,
we submit our cause to the judgment
of the people, and it I am elected
I want to feel that behind me I have a ma
jority of these people, and then, so help me
<iodl I will carry out tne platform to the letter.
[Arplause and cheer.".]
Be not discouraged by abuse. Abuse has al
ways been the portion of those who fought
agaiust intrenched privileges. If you become
annoyed, turn back jo the pages of history,
and for every name that is applied to you, you
will find one equally sfvere applied to Jeffer
son; for every name applied to you, you will
find one equally severe applied to Jackson.
Ah, ray friends, 1 may go nearer than that
That great spirit yonder (pointing to a por
trait of Lincoln"!, was as malignantly attacked
by the aristocracy of wealth, and would be as
unpopular to-day in New York or Boston
among our financiers as Jackson was, as Jei
ferson was in his day.
Any man who believes that the people ought
to stand equal beiore these laws will be
abused by those who desire favoritism in
legislation and special privileges from
governments. Iso not terrified. Do your
duly as ymi see it. I believe that we
shall triumph â aye, more than believe â
as surety as the sun shall rise the day will
come when the morning sun shall rise upon
our cause, the day will come when bimetal
lism will be restored to this conntry, the day
wiil come when the money of the constitu
tion will again be onrs.
The day will come when trusts shall obey
the law; the day will come when corpora
tions will cease to be greater than the Gov
ernment which created them. [Applause.]
The day will come when the people of this
country will bu content to stand side by
side, not one upon another; the day
will come, when standing- shoulder to shoulder
they shall march on, each one content to en
joy li c and liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness, without attempting to deprive his neigh
bor of equal opportunity and equal rights.
[Applause.]
Mr. Bryan left Cincinnati this morning
at 7 o'clock. Lawrtnceburg was the first
stop and the candidate looked well wheu
he mounted the platform there to address
an audience of 2000. Short silver speechea
were made at several other stops.
ACCEPTS THE NOMINATION.
Jttyan Write* a letter to ' the Populist*. of
â¢ the Nation.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 3.-William J.
Bryan to day gave out his letter accepting
the Populist nomination. It reads as fol
lows:
Lincoln, Nebr., Oct. 3, 1896.
Hon. William V. Allen, Chairman, and others,
it 'cmbtrs of the Notification Committee of the Peo
pie's Partyâ Gentlemen : The nomination of
the People's party for the Presidency of the
United States bag been tendered me in a gen
erous spirit and upon such honorable terms
that I am able to accept the same without de
parting from the platform adopted by the Na
tional Convention at Chicago. I "lully ap
preciate the breadth of the patriotism which
has actuated the members of the People's
party, who, in order to consolidate the senti
ment in favor of bimetallism, bave been will
ing to go outside of party lines and support as
their candidate one already named by the
Democratic party and also by the Silver party.
I also appreciate the fact that while during
all the years since 1873 a large tuajn ity of
the Democratic party and a considerable
minority of the Republican party have been
consistent advocates of the free coinage of sil
ver at the present ratio, yet ever since the or
ganization of the People's party its members
have unanimously supported such coinage as
the only means of restoring bimetallism. By
persistently pointing out the disastrous effects
of a gold standard and protesting against each
successive step toward financial bondage the
Populists have exerted an important infroence'
in awakening the public to a realization of the
Nation's present peril.
In a time like mis, when a great political
party is attempting to surrender the right to
legislate for ourselves upon the flnancinl ques
tion and is seeking to bind the American peo
p!e to a forelpn monetary system, it behoove*
us as lovers of our country and friends of Amer
ican lnÂ«tirutinns to lay aside for the present
such differences as may exist among us on
minor questions in order that our strength
may be united in a supreme effort to wrest
the Government out of the hands of those
who imagine that the Nation's finances are
only secured when controlled by a few finan
ciers and that National honor can only be
maintained by servile acquiescence in any
policy, ttj r > ver destructive to the interests of
the people of the United States, which foreign
creditors, present or prospective, may desire
to force upon us.
It is a cause of congratulation that we have
In this camDaign not oniy the support of
I>emocrats, Populists and Republicans who
have all along believed in independent bi
metallism, but also the active co-operation of
tho^e Democrats and Republicans who have
heretofore waited for international bi
metallism, and now join with us rather than
trust the destinies of the Nation in the hand*
of those who are holdi;i(r the delusive hope of
foreign aid, while tney labor secretly for the
permanent establishment oi the siijgie gold
standard.
While difficulties have always arisen In the
settlement of details of any plan of co-opera
tion between distinct political organizations,
I am sure that the advocates of bimetallism
are so intensely in earnest that they will
be able to devise iome means by which
the free-silver forces may be concentrated
upon one electoral ticket in each Slate. To se
cure this result, charity toward the opinions
of others and liberality on the part of all is
necessary, but hon^t and sincere friends who
are working toward a common result always
find it possible to agree upon just and equit
able terms. The American people have proven
equal to every emergency which has ariseu in
the past, and I am confident that in the pres
ent emergency there will be no antagonism
between the various regiments of the one
great army which is marching to repel an in
vasion more dangerous to our weliare than an
army with banners.
In acknowledging, with gratitude, your ex
pression of confidence and good will, I am
very truly yours, William J. Betas.
DRUBBED BY CITIZENS.
Friends of Cuba Give a Spanish
Consul a Severe Whipping
at Jacksonville.
An Unpleasant Affray That May Lead
to Unpleasant International
Complications
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Oct. 3.â A story
comes from Jacksonville, Fla., which^ if
true, may further complicate the rela
tions between this country and Spain.
The story is to the effect that a fight oc
curred there yesterday between a Darty of
Cuban sympathizers on the one side and
the Spanish Consul there and. some Pinfc
erton detectives on the other, in which the
latter party was worsted.
The Spanish Consul and the detectives
were observing the movements of the
Cubans, whose leader was Colonel Emillo
Nunez of this city. As no deadlier weap
ons were used than fists, there were no
fatalities, but the Consul and his men are
slid to have received a severe drubbing.
The Consul communicated the affair to
the Spanish Minister at Washington, and
the latter is said to have made a demand
upon President Cleveland for reparation
for an assault upon a Spanish Consul and
the insult resulting therefrom to the
crown of Spain.
It was also learned here to-day that the
famous little filibustering steamer Lau
rada is suspected of being about to run
another filibustering expedition to Cuba.

TACOMA'S MAYOR OUSTED
Supreme Court Orders Fawcett
to Surrender Office
to Orr.
Over One Hundri'd and Fifty City
Employes A if: c ted by the
Decision.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 3.â A. V. Faw
cett will turn over the office of Mayor to
Edward S. Orr on Monday. This is the
result of yesterday's decision of the Su
preme Court, to the effect that Fawcett's
filing of an appeal bond does not stay pro
ceedings pending the review by the Su
preme Court of Judge Pritchard's decision
that Orr was entitled to the office on ac
count of the ballots. While Fawcett
would be reseated should the Supreme
Court reverse . ihe Superior Court on the
main questions involved, it is believed
that Orr will take his seat permanently,
because Judge Pritchard has seldom been
reversed.
The Sunreme Court decision broueht
consternation to over 150 employes in the
Water, Poiice, Fire and City Hall depart
ments. These places were tilled by Demo
crats and Populists last April when Faw
cett took office. Now the incumbents must
make way for Republicans.
Mayor Fawcett says he will retire on
the receipt of a copy of the Supreme
Court's order. Tnis will be served on him
Monday morning. He will return to his
private business as president of tbe Faw

of tbe Forest With a Wreath
of Oak Leaves.
DUPED BY AMERICAN SHARPENS
Confiding Youths Pay Money to " Cap
tains" for ths Privi ege of
Becoming Soldiers.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 3.â The Em
peror left Rominten this morning and
will join the Empress to-morrow at Huber
tussersstock, where he will continue his
hunting. While at Bominten the Emperor
shot an immense staj: which had twenty
antlers. His Majesty could not suppress
his joy, and the woods re-echoed with his
thrice shouted li Hurrahs." Then turning
to Herr Augems, the forest ranger, the
Kaiser vehemently shook his hand and
gave evidences in other ways of the pride
which he felt in having bagged so noble
an animal.
At the banquet which was held after the
hunt that evening the Emperor declared
that the stag was tbe biggest tbat had been
shot in Germany for years. Measurement
of the animal showed that its antlers were
over three feet long and the crown, which
had six points, weighed eighteen pounds.
When tjio stag was laid out the chief
ranger decorated the Emperor with a
wreath of oak leaves, which he presented
to his Majesty upon the point of a hunt
ine knife.
The United States Embassy here has
learned that two Americans, giving their
names as Captain George Hubbard of New
Orleans and Captain Fred Williams of San
Francisco, both pretending to be officers
of the United States army, have been con
ducting a lucrative swindling business, by
inveigling persons of mean 3 into enlisting
as they supposed in the United States
army, and inducing them to pay for the
privilege of doing sounder promises made
by the two. pretended officers that they
woul'i exert their personal influence to
secure the speedy promotion of their re
cruits to tbe rank of lieutenant, captain,
etc. All of those wbo paid for their en
listment were asked to meet the captain
at tlie railway station one day last week
for the purpose of arranging for their pas
sage to America. Many of them made
their appearance at the station, but failed
to find the captain.
The dupes of the spurious captains then
went to the United States Consulate to
seek redress, and were there informed that
the caDtains were not known to any one
attached to the consulate, and moreover
that Germans enlisting in a foreign array
were violating the laws of Germ: ny. The
swindlers appear to be German-Americans.
Some of the details of the swindling are
very amusing. Two young Germans en
listed with Hubbard and vVilliams and
paid them the money they demanded, but,
becoming suspicious, wanted to bave tbe
"captains" identified at the United States
consulate. Tne "captains" acceded to
tbis and readily accompanied their vic
tims. Arriving ai tbe first floor of the
building occupied by the Consul the
swindlers, under the pretext of ascertain
ing if the Consul would be able to see them
immediately, went up alone ;o the second
floor, where the Consul's offices are situ
ated, leaving their victims on the floor
below. Instead of going into the Consul's
office, however, they tooK the elevator, de
scended to the ground floor and hurriedly
took their departure, leaving their dupes
waiting for them to return to the first
floor.
In another case their victim gave them
money with which to purchase his railway
ticket to the port from which he was to
embark for America. The swindlers took
the money and entered the booking office
through which they quickly passed and
walked out of the end of tho building. The
waiting victim has not t>een them since.
Another incident involving the claim
ant to the honor of being an officer in the
United States army is being discussed in
the clubs and cafes. An American claim
ing to be the new military attache to the
United States Embassy to succeed Captain
R. K. Evans, who has just retired from
that office arrived at Hamburg from New
Yok on September 25 on board the
steamer Fuerst Bismarck, traveling sec
ond-class. The man wore the uniform
of an officer of the United States
army and when he landed he cre
ated a scene upon the docks upon
being confronted by the customs
officers. He talked in a loud and bluster
ing fashion and threatened to make a
complaint against the conduct of the
officials to tbe United States Embassador.
He has not yet made bis appearance at
tbe Embassy, however, nor has any ap
pointment been made to fill the post of
military attache vacated by Captain
Evans.
HOTEL RAFAEL'S DIVERSION.
Exciting Finith to the Paper Chat* Over
Marin Meadows.
BAN RAFAEL, Cal., Oct. 3.â The paper
chase to-day was the best and most excit
ing of the series, completely refuting tbe
idea that interest in this diversion wai
waning. The course led up over tbe bills
northeast of Hotel Rafael and terminated
in the old Magnolia Park. The "hares"â
Mrs. Crooks and Mr. Evan Evans â were
not overtaken, but the incoming of the
"hounds," numbering twenty-five or
thirty, all close together and riding at
terrific speed, was more exciting than
that of any former finish. Hundreds of
the Hunt Club and their friends were
present and the roomy park was full of
equipages and people in saddle.
CThe lady's prize was a beautiful silver
flower bo wlÂ». presented by Miss Warbur
ton and won by Miss Bruce; the gentle
man's a very handsome saddle, presented
by Evan Evans and won by Frank S.
Johnson.
Stanford* President Returnt.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
3. â Dr. David Starr Jordan arrived here
to-day after nearly four months' absence
from the university. Mrs. Jordan met
him in San Francisco this morning. Tne
president of tbe university looks greatly
improved in health by his long trip* and
returns to the duties of his position in a
frame of mind and condition of body to
care for them easily.
bugar Factory for Sonoma.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 3.â Great in
tÂ«rest is taken in the proposed establish
ment of a factory for the manufacture of
beet susrar in Santa Rosa. A meeting of
farmers in this section will ba called to
consider the matter.
Sonoma' 'Â« Held of Bine.
SANTA KOSA, Cal., Oct. 3.â The vint-
a*e of Sonoma County is now in progress.
The yield will be larger than was antici
pated, and will reach 5,000,000 gallons.

POINT WILSON DIVER'S FEAT.
Extent of Damages to the Stranded
Steamship Umatilla Learned at the
Risk of His Life.
POKT TOWNSEND, Wash., Oct. 3.â A
dangerous diving feat on the part of A. O.
Benjamin this morning revealed in great
part the extent of damage to the steam
ship Umatilla, which last Tuesday morn
ing scraped on the rocky Deach on the
straits near i?cmt Wilson lighthouse,
where it is now beached. He went down
between the boilers and found that a hole
thirty feet long ana three wide had Deen
ripped in tbe starboard garboardâ that is,
in the second line of plates from the keel
son, the vessel having no keel. Of course
other plates are more or less damaged and
wrenched, but three are gone entirely,
having been ripped off in the accident.
Two divers are at present at work and
three more will be engaged to work two
shifts and expedite the repairing, which
will be done by planking up the big holes.
After that the water wiil be pumped out
and then the cargo will be discharged. It
is impossible to move any of the freight in
its present swollen condition.
The dimensions of the hole are only
rough estimates, there being several inches
overlap by the adjacent plates, which wiil
reduce the measurements cf the aperture
slightly.
Captain Hunter to-day filed a wreck
report at the Custom-house. It says the
acoident was caused by a thick fog and a
silent wbistle on Point Wilson. The
Umatilla is valued at $1i65,000 and insured
for $230,000. The cargo, valued at $100,000,
was damaged to the extent of $90,000 and
insured for $40,000.
STOCKTON JOINS WITH FRESNO.
Excursionists Will Attend the Jtaisin
City's Valley Road Celebration.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 3.â Great prep
arations are being made for the Valley
road excursion to Fresno on Monday.
The two militia companies here â A and
B of the Sixth Regiment â were arranging
to go with the excursionists, but General
Muller did not get their acceptance of the
Invitation in time, and so the car which
was to be placed at the disposal of the
militiamen was turned over to tbe
Modesto and Merced companies. From
Stockton a large number of prominent
citizens are going. Tue members of the
Stockton Commercial Association and the
city and county officials will nearly all
attend, besides a number of others promi
nent in the community who are deeply
interested in the success of the Valley
road.
Tlie excursion train will leave here
promptly at 8 o'clock on Monday morning,
and is expected to reach the Raipin City
by 1 o'clock. The return trip will be
made the same day, leaving Fresno at 6
o'clock in the evening, arriving here at 11
o'clock. There are a num ber of the Fresno
committee in town to-night arranging the
details of the excursion, which heralds
the first direct intercourse between the
Raisin City and the Mill City.
FRESNO'S SENSATION.
City Trustee Spinney Defendant in a
Suit for JJivorce.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 3.â A sensational
suit for divorce has been filed in tbe Su
perior Court of this county by Mrs. Eliza
beth Spinney against City Trustee Joseph
Spinney. The complaint charges unhus
bandlike actions on the part of the Trus
tee with Miss Delia Kojas, a Mexican lass
of this city of about twenty-two summers,
who up to a few months ago worked as a
taiioress in a local establishment. Since
tbat time she has been a lady of leisure,
wearing diamonds and drivine fine horses,
all at Spinney's expense, so his wife says.
The plaintiff and deftndant in the suit
were "married twenty-four years ago in
Maine. They have resided in this county
for nineteen years. Spinney i 3 a promi

nent Knights of Pythias. He attempted
to swindle Justice Qardner, but was
detected and banded over to Officer
Dougherty and escaped only to be tired
upon and caught by Sheriff Besse.

Reasons for Believing That an
Entente Is Formed as to
Armenia.
UNDER A TKIPLE PROTECTION.
Peculiar Ignorance of the English and

ICepyrltht. 1896, by t c New Times.]
LONDON. Esq., Oct. 3.â ln spite of a
]nore enerous flow than usual of court
news from Balmoral, due, it. is said, to the
personal interposition of the Queen in
favor of the barred-out journalists, the
only matters the world cares to know
about in connection with the Czar's visit
are kept fairly secret. There are in con
sequence wild rumors alÂ»out many impos
sible things which Lord Salisbury could
not Lave said to tbe Czar, but not a word
leaks out about Armenia. The public re
ceives liberal information as to the num
ber and kind of uniforms in which the
Russian monarch has been photographed
in tbe course of a single morning, w tie
the optimistic reports about his excellent
health are about as accurate as tbe fairy
tales told regarding his prowess in shoot
ing Highland game.
Meanwhile all England, indeed all the
thinking and fighting word of Europe, is
intently watchiug this overwrought young
man, whose delicate frame, shaken by
rtcent tragedies, hardly seems strong
enough to stand what would be an almost
breaking s<rain for a far stronger man.
The piecautions taken to-night all along
the route traveled by the Czar exceed any
thing previously known in the history of
royal-protected i rogress in this country.
The imperial person is to be gua-ded all
through England and out to see, as if
Nichoias were passing through an enemy's
country, anii Englishmen who wish to see
their country's honored guest will have to
go to France f r that purpose. It is possi
ble tbat there are special reasons for these
defensive measures in that the authorities
know best where ti eir secret enemies are;
yet the common-sense explanation is
probably that the young man requires
quiet and an opportunity to pull himself
together before facing the m sw brilliant
but most trying days of bis life.
As to the Armenian question, two things
tend to show the c: .'.stence ot an entente
cordiale between Russia and England in
this matter. One is tbe favor evidently
shown to Lord Salisbury and the h.gh
honor bestowed on him. Another is the
perhaps unwilling but very decided im
provement m the tone of the Russian
press, although that press is still very
caTfrful to impress on ita readers the fact
that this is only decent civility to the peo
ple in whose house their master happens
to be lodging. Whatever has been sug
gested or discussed or even decided at
Balmoral, the ultimate adjustment must,
it is opined by those who know best and
are nearest to the hiuheit actors, depend
on the events and conference of the next
few days in France. Till these have taken
place the rest is mere guesswork.
From Vienna comes i,he musterious
message that all is honorably settled, but.
tbe terms are not stated. It seemÃ more
than probable tbat the settlement may
take tbr form of confining the Armenians
within certain districts under the triple
protection of Russia, France and Eng
land, and yet a short study of the map
will show the difficulty of an Armenian
pale.
It 1a somewhat amusing to watch the
floundering of certain portions of the
English press in its calculation about the
coming Presidential election in the United
States. The more sensible papers
aoknowledjie their ignorance in the
matter; the other 3 dolefully own that if
Mr. Bryan wins it will gravely imperil
the safety of every large investment of
Britisn capital in America, while Mr. Me-
Kin ley's success will mean aggressive
protectionist measures specially hostile to
British trade. The one thing clear to
newspaper critics heie is that Great
Britain stands to lose either way. Little
is said by those Englishmen wbosf>
opinion would be received with respect in
America, as it is felt by the best men here
tbat any decided expression of opinion
might very rightly be resented as imperti
nent interference at a most critical time.
Their silence is very far from meaning
hatred to Mr. McKinley or a gold policy.
There are still some sane men ia Eng
land.
German opinion has been busying itself
with Prince Bismarck's letter to Governor
Culberson, and one thing is perfectly
clear. It i; well known that Bismarck is
loftily ignorant on economic and metallic
questions. No one knows this better than
himself, for he has expressed very clearly
to Lord Aidentmm and others his regret
thai he ever meddled in currency matters.
Keen and level-headed Germans in Amer
ica will be the first to recognize that the
Iron Chancellor, witb all his great gifts,
is little likely now that he is far removed
from active political life to be able to
give an authoritative opinion on a subject
which puzzled him wben every possible
means of official and private information
was ready to his hand. Bismarck's advice
deserves respectful attention simply as the
tentative utterance of an aged student,
probing in his later years a difficult sub
ject which be was confessedly unable or
unwilling to master in his youth. Bis
marck's advice may have a hitat En -land,
but he shouid have chosen a weapon
which be more accusiomted to handle.
Although it wi 1 take some three years
more to really complete thecpsningof tbe
Iron Gates of the Danube, the presence of
the Austrian Emperor at the official open
ing, and his subsequent visit to Rouma
nia have completed an alliance which
may de more fraught with graye conse
quences to European his ory than even
the gnat ngineering feat itseif. There
is without doubt a very close aid definite
alliance between Austria and Iloiiaaani.-.,
which may lead before long in a new
shake up and a new grouping of the
powers or Europe. The one tiling wanted
is. perhaps, a great Au>trian statesman.
The new treaty made between Italy and
Tunis is very favorably looked upon by
honest statesmen in Borne, and it is con

sidered a success for the Ministry. Doubt
less it is but the precursor to a better com
mercial arrangement between France and
Italy. Large hopes are entertained by
competent Frenchmen interested in the
Italian wine trade for a near future when
the stream of sound and healthy wines
from southern grapes will once more be
turned into French channels. In this the
consumer has much to gain and afterward
so far as modest vintages are concerned
very little to lose.
The sudden stoppage of the Nile cam
paign has caused little surprise to those
whose business it was to study the finan
cial aspects of the situation. There is no
money available for prosecuting the war
farther as an Egyptian loan is not favored.
It will be curious'to watch the outcome of
tbe present deadlock between the foreign
caisse de la dette publique and the Egyp
tian treasury. The susceptibilities of
France have to be studied with the great
est care, but if England is to pay all the
costs of the campaign she can hardly be
blamed if she expects something solid for
her money. The behavior of the Egyptian
troops has been beyond all praise and the
rumors about the insubordination of one
English regiment have been grossly exag
gerated.
The tax on floui, imposed some time
back by tbe Belgian Government in place
of the light duties that were abolished at
Belgian ports, is killing the corn trade in
tbat country. The large millers can no
longer afford to buy the American flour,
which so greatly improved the quality of
tbe native product wnen mixed witb it,
and the smaller millers are utterly ruined
because ti>e bigger men swallow up all of
the peasants' harvests, which previously
fed the small mills. All corn trade is
turning away to other countries. The
movement to abolish the light dues and to
lessen the port dues originated in Ant
werp, with the intention of attracting
business, but things are now so bad that
it is difficult to see how Belgium can easily
recover from so sorious a blow to its agri
culture.
Sensational reports have been flying
about of late to the effect that the Queen
is losing ncr eyesight. The rumors had
no other basis ban a visit paid to her by
a great oculist Irom Weisbaden and there
is absolutely nothing in them. Her latest
signatures to official documents are ad
mirabie examples of clear handwriting.
While all the excitable people in Eng
land have been either exhorting each
other to do something for Armenia or
j ining in somewhat childish abuse of the
German Emperor, a very remarkable con
gress at B-rlin has passed almost un
noticed. Twelve thousand women from
every country in Europe assembled on the
vast council-ball of the Rathhaus and
constituted a woman's parliament on all
questions save one. Armenia was well
represented ; indeed, she led the congress
at ail times. Politics wa? the Bluebeard's
chamber of the occasion and no public
use was made of th* key, but it is rumored
that when the congress meets in London
two years hence flbis restriction will be
removed.
Englishmen in and out of the city look
forward with pleasure to the term of office
o. the newly elected Lord Mayor of Lon
don, Alderman Fandel Phillips. This
gifted gentleman, whose father was Lord
Mayor thirty years ago, is the fourth Jew
to hold this office. His wife is a daughter

Telegraph.
The grievous illness of George Dv
Maurier shows no sign- of abating. Tbe
greatest sympathy is felt for him here,
and it will no doubt be echoed from tbe
United States. The latest news from him
was very serious indeed.
Considerable ferment has been caused
in high church circles here by the dis
cussion of the Papal bull on the Anglican
orders. Cardinal Vaughan, at a meeting
of the Catholic Truth Society at Harley,
definitely, but with admirable courtesy
and tact, made it clear that Anglican
orders are not recognized and never will
be. Nothing else was to have been ex
pected and it is more than possible that
the next few weeks will see in more senses
than one many journeys to Rome.
Tbe inhabitants of Black Island in the
River Shannon have their own clear views
about the justice of collecting arrears of
the seed potato rate. This being so, they
and friendly neighbors on the mainland
have drawn upon the shore all their boats
and the Sheriff and bis minions cannot
get hear them. lam â¦â Id that the Black
islanders have a goodly stock of pro
visions and that the Sheriff may be a
much older man when finally he effects a
landing on the island.
The past week has Deen an anxious and
exciting time in tbe city. It came alter
more than two years of abnormally eht j ap
money, during which speculation for a rise
was carried on witb unbroken success and
Tom, Dick and Harry were able to borrow
money at from 1 to 2 percent upon all
kinds of promising as well as paying
securities. During all that time, too, it
Heemed as if really there were no end to
the possibilities of malting money in this
way. Suddenly the English store of gold
began to dwindle and a drain to the
United States set in. The Bank of Eng
land raised its rate and the resulting new
standpoint revealed tbe weakness of specu
lation and perilous condition of affairs.
The only wonder is that there was not a
serious panic. As a matter of fact tbe
action of the bank was chiefly precaution
ary. Money is now found in plenty for
everybody at no more than 3 per cent and
the city generally inclined to laugh at its
own fears. Stock Exchange men are glad,
however, that "settlement" and the end of
tbe quarter are over.
The propo&ed Spanish loan, a complete
fiasco now on t c market for foreign
bonds, is under a cloud, which tbe East
ern question and Continental doubts as
regards the desi.-us of the British Govern
ment do nothing to lighten. The Amer
ican market, however, is much improved
in tone by the dwindling prospects of the
silverites, while home securities of the
good and better sorts are buoyant.
Meetings were held to-day all over Eng
land to express indignation at tbe Arme
nian business, but there is certainly a
falling off in the intensity of tbe lever. It
| is due, possibly, to bints from responsible
J quarters that something is really doing.
j Certainly Lord Salisbury had over two
hours of taik with the French EmbaÂ«sador
yesterday and ; he latest advices received
to-night from Constantinople ten i to
show a suspension of hostilities there.
When the English temperature has low
ered again and wben English eyes are less
blinded by fires in the East, people will
rind room for sad and sober reflection in
the fact that thiÂ» week, owing to thÂ« ter
rible depression in the coal and iron trade,
no less that 10,000 men were idle in th?
Rhonda Valley in Wales. Nor is this tbe
only trade in which matters are at a
serious pass in this country.

BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. 3.â The cham
pions worsted the Clevelands to-day 1 with
the same spirit that ; characterized yester
day's j game ; and won â  by about the ' same
score, 7 to j2. ; But even the winners were
not happy. ' r The . attendance ; r was 3100 in
stead of the 10,000 expected. The players
bitterly complained I of ; the i lack of ? appre
ciation of j their efforts ;in bringing ; the
pennant to Baltimore and '$ it 'â  is 4 possible
the game scheduled here for Monday will
be played in another c;tyv* ; probably Pitts
burg, in honor of % the don .'-r of * the cup,
which is being contested for. ,'.\;
;*;â¢:: To-day's game was called back â to ? the
eighth inning on account of darkness,
after the home team had scored two runs <
in tbe ninth with no one out. Tebau's
injured back kept him out of the contest
and be was sadly missed. There was no
life nor dash in the Cleveland make-up.
The four runs which the champions par
ne-rnd in tbe first inning acted as a wet
blanket on their aspirations, and they
played like automatons thereafter. 8c â "c:

FOR THE FUTURE OF KOREA.
Settlement of the New Arrangement Be-
tween Russia and Japan Not
Pleasing to England.
LONDON, England, Oct. 3.â The settle
ment of the new arrangement between
Japan and Russia for trie future ot Korea
is not well received here. It will be a
source of great weakness to the new Jap
anese Ministry, for Japan, having fought
a war to get rid of Chinese influence in the
peninsula, has only succeeded in letting
in the far more formidable Influence of
Russia, and in place of a weak, trouble
some and irritating partner, has one very
much stronger than heretofore. Mean
white tbe Kiug remains in tne Russian
legation and absolutely refuses io return
to his own valace, thongh that
is provided for by the Russo-Japanese ar
rangement. The Kin^'i" perversiiy, added
to the Japanese popular dissent and a
change of Ministry in Japan, with a For
eign Minister disposed to a "strong for
eign poiicy,'' may upset the new arrange
ment and ti. row Korea and her un.ortu
nate roonarebs to the mercy of circum
stances again.
President KniÃer's "war budget" is

--000 for special eervxes. ' The question is
askea again, To wtiom is tin- vast ex
penditure, seventeen lold more than last
year's request, directed? The solution
suggested in Capetown is that the Presi
dent meditates some coup of his own in
conjunction with the Orange Free State.

COLE YOTWG'S LAST HOLE-TIP.
Curious Crowds at Albuquerque Gaze
on the Corpse of Rob*
sou's Slayer.
ALBUQUERQUE. N. Mix., Oct. 3-
Owin# to tbe darkness the Shi-riff and hit
party were unable to follow the Rio Puerco
train-robbers las' night, but boarded a spe
cial train at daylight this morning. Tbe
bandits went due south from tbe place of
the hold-up, and are believed to be headed
for the Magdalena or Mogallon Moun
tains. The Sheriff's posse from Rio Puerco
is following the trail, while another posse,
beaded by Marshal Loomis and Special
Officer Siiva, started from Albuquerque at
3 o'clock this morning, going to the town
of Magdahna uy rail and thence west on
horseback, hoping to intercept tbe robbers
before tney reach a hiding-place in the
mountains.
The body of the robber killed at Rio
Puerco iast night was brought into town
by the train tnat he had attacked and is
now lying at the undertaker's here, having
been surrounded by a curious crowd all
day.
The body is pronounced by Marshal
Loomis and a number of others to be ibat
of Cole Y.'uni:, wb>> shot Line-r.der Frank
Rol/son, between Benson and Nogales,
and who bad been engaged in several
other desperaie affairs in the Southwest.
For his apprehension several rewards
nave been offered.
There is but little doubt now in the
min -is of the officers tbat tbe men wbo
heid up the train last night are thÂ» same
tans; that has been teirorizmg Southwest
ern New Mexico for the la't two months,
but it is believed tbat with the energetic
measures taken tor tne pursuit of the
bandits it will be impossible for thorn to
succeed in making their way to thoir
rendezvous in tne mountains. If the pur
suing parties succeed in coming up witb
them there wih undoubtedly bÂ«s some des
perate work, for butti pi ;t-e;j are composed .
of men wbo know wha: it is to stand up
in front of a gun, and as tbe bandits know
tliai train-robbing in this Territory means
hanging they will never surrender.

Los Aisles, Cal.. Oct. 3. )
United State* Sena:or George C. Pertins
â¢f Oakland was accorded a reception by
the citizens of Los Angeles on his arrival
from the North th.s afternoon. He was
accompanied by Co.oael Jo -n P. Jackson.
Senator Perk ns and tha reception com
miuee, composed of representative busi
ness and professional men. were at Arcade
station when the S&n Fr&scuco train ar
rived. A procession was formed, headed
by the Los Angeles military band, and
marched to Main street and through the
business center of the city to the Chamber
of Commerce at Fourth and Broadway.
There was much cheering aii along the
line of marc a.
A force of directors under Superin
tendent Wiggins had Deen at work all the
morning converting the spacious rooms
into bowers of flowers and evergreens. The
decorations were tasteful end elegant.
The recepucn to Senator Perkins lasted
from 2 until 4 o'clock. During the speaK
ing and social intercourse claret punch
and sandwichf s were served. An address
of welcome was delivered by President
Patterson of the Chamber of Commerce,
Senator Perkins responded in a happy
speech, and snort speeches were made by
others.
This evening a ereat meeting was held
at Hazard's Pavilion, which was presided
over by George Stuart. The meeting was
under the auspices of the Sound Money
Club, which had invited the citizens of
all shades of political opinions to t&Ke
part. Senator Perkins, who made the first
speech of tn* evening, was roundly ap
plauded by the thousands who had felled
tit great pavilion to its utmost capacity.
In the course of his remarks the Senator
said:
This mamifieeTit gathering speaks in lan
f cÂ»c? store potent tain words that the elec
tion* this ye*.- is cot 501=5: ct ce:aolu and th&t
aeias the election of Major M>'K;nley on >'o-
Tember 3.
All are Interested alik* in having a good
goTenuaeau To obtain this we each ally cti>
â¢elves with the party which nearest repre
rsu our views respecting political economy.
The EePÃblican party ccnie* before the people
of the Nmuon &nd says, '-Oar platforsi will in
sure its prosperity; this shall M tie text upon
which we asi your votes."
Whet: our Democratic rr ends took possession
of the Government 'oat years ago, the coun
try was prospÂ«roua, la workshops were filled
with happy and contented Itborers. Bat the
people demanded a change and the? got it.
Ton remember lour years "asro the Democrat
orators caste before us &nd gave creai premises
of what they proposed to da But no sooner
had they taken the helm of state -hats indus
trial armies befac to march cpon Washington
from all parts of the las a. rover Clere:and
â aid: "Kewi! the psirchisinf in of the
Â£hennas act and the sun of prosperity will
thine." bet the wheel* of Industry did not
start and our laborers remained unemployed.
Then Professor i soa came with his bill
to re. .eye the t-ur-iens which had depressed
our lndastries, and it was enacted into law;
bat still the era c: prosperity did not return.
I shall cot wearr you by railing you how the
â Wilson bill affects New England, Xew Tori,
Mary land, Ohio and the Mississippi States;
bet does it a:f>ci Los Angeles ?
It cornea right home to you here. It reduces
the price of roar trait*. Bones, cattle, males
asd sheep. Tour years ago oar Democratic
and Popalist friends could not look at a
aheepâ the harmless, inoffensive creature â
witaoat trying to kick i; cut of the war. The
aicKi&.ey bill axed: a specific duty of 30 cents
per head of horses and mules, 10 on cattle
and $150 on ahe;p, bat the Wilson bill re
d-.crti thÂ« tariff 20 per cent ad valorem. ' la
Mexico cattle are valued at $3 per head. The
duty at 20 per cent would be $1 each, uader
which Mexico furnishes us with livestock and
destroys that industry.
I say it is an unjust act to the people of the
United States, for it destroys our sa^ar-jrow
ing isÂ£ustry, when California alone, u=aer
proper protection, could raise two-thirdi of
the sacar necessary to k-scply the people of
the Uuited States. The Wilson bill was ceiled
aa act for revenue, but it could be more pro
erly named an act to create a deficiency.
Whea Harrison turned the Government over
to thÂ« Democrats he left $136,000,000 ia the
reaerve fond. Clerelaad depleted the treasury
and bonded the country to keep the reserve
fnadfrom iaÂ«i dancer limit. Oa these bonds
thÂ« people pay 500.000 interest annually.
Thes* bond*, how were they saMI The
admiaUtratioa had a friend la court who dis
posed of them to their Scandal advacta^e,
uatil a publican arose ia the United Slates
&eua:e and offered a resolution that the bonds
be <Hirnesl of to our people ia a ness-like
manner. When bids for #100,000.000 bonds
were advertised to be sold the pecp^a applied
MtnÂ«rchaÂ«e Â£600.000,000. " Â«-
The Wilson Mil did another thing: It re
pealed the reciprocity actâ the product of the
era: 2 of that great aid imaottai tiaiesaaaa.
James G. Biaiae.
On the silver question *and I call history to
aii) the Eepublicaa party is the trae tarty of
bimetallism, and every dollar it has given "the
people is as good as gold. The R-pub.:c*a
par;y did more than that. It gave the soldier
x*p*r money for his services and made that
looaey as good as gold.
And it will continue- to make It as good as
goltf. To-da? every dollar we have is worth a
gold dollar, and why? Â£ecaÂ«sÂ«it -knows thai
m redeemer i:veth." What we want, my
fnesds, is a chaa.e to work, and when we
work we want as good coney as there is ia the

PISALIA'S GREETING TO BOWERS.
fetors Gather in Hundreds to Listen to
Hit Speech-Short of Fresno Wins
Votes for McKiniey.
VIS ALIA, Cal.. Oct. S.-Visaiia was
ablaxe with enthusiasm to-ni^ht in greet
ing to Congressman W. W. Bowers and
Hon. Frank H. Short of Frssno. Mr.
Bowers arrirÂ«d this morning and during
the day had been busy shaking hands and
exchanging congratulations with bis con
stituents on the approaching victory for
McKmiey and the triumph of protection.
At 7:30 o'clock a special tram from Tulare
arrived, bringing hundreds of ecthu*.jÂ«:.c
Republicans to help cwell the already
great throng. They trere rece.Ted by me
Visalia brass band and marched down to
the Visa.ia and Goshen depot, where they
assisted in the reception of Mr. Short of
Fresno and the Hanlord Gee Club. A
procession was formed at this point and
the march to the Palace Hose! began. On
arriving there she shou:s for iieKinier
and Bowers were deafening.
It was a little after 5 o'clock when the
meeting was called w order by Hon.
"Wbeaton A. Gray, who read a lone I
Tice-preaidents, aU of whom took seats on
the piatform. The vtv air seemed Â«a-
charged with enthusiasm, for at erery
mention of the names of McKiniey and
Bowers the shouts almost raised the ; roof.
When Congressman Bowers was intro
duced he was given an ovation. He dis
cussed the tarn? question as only a man
can who has had a vaÂ«t experience with
public affairs, and Â» tea l>.?uioera:s who
listened to htm and then pÂ«rs<st in voting
for Bryan will never have the nerve â¢to
look a sheep in the face. The demagogic
appeal of the Popocrats for free silver in
order to hide the incompetence and ve
nality of the present Democratic admin
istration was . well exposed. Said the
speaker:
A great many of you wish to know now I
stand on the silver question. I am a silver
man because the Republican party is a friend
of silver. [Appiause.] Look at the Demo
cratic, party; its first work was to strike at
â¢liver, yet it comes now and poses as the friend
of the white meta.. You know that party
never kept its word. lam going to vote for
ilcKialey lor the same reasou that netriy all
of t.js American Democrats are going to vote
for hiniâ because he is 1a favor 01 protection,
the oniy thin* that will bring prosperity to
this Nation. [Cheers.]
I stand for tae free ana, unlimited coinage of
silver and gold, with a tariff dmy of 50 per
cent on the foreign uroduct. [A, pi*
Tne disaster that is now bligaung the people
came on us when a Democratic administration
was voted iuto power. We were always pros
perous when we had protection, and a retain
to thai system is tne only thing iba; will save
us irom "ruia aad bankruptcy. (Tamuliuou*
applause.]
Hoc. Frank H. Short was given a hearty
reception, and his cool, calm and incisive
reasoning carried conviction to his near
ers. He is a tall, nae-appearirig man. and
his command of language seems limitless.
He is a master o; w:t and sarcasm. The
many excellent points made by Mr. Short
were vigorously applauded, and bis audi
ence would have oeen content to listen to
his beautiiul word pictures for hours
longer, It was late when he concluded,
bat had won bis hearers completely.
Mr. Short will speak in San Francisco
next Friday night, with Hoo. Jo Camp
bell.
The singing of the Hanford Glee Club
was one of the features of the evening and
was mucti appreciated. On the whole tne
meeting was a votemaker from every
standpoint, and will be the means of
largely increasing' the vote ior McKinley
aad Bowers.
SHAW AT BOULDER CREEK.
Discusses the Monetary Problem Before
a Large Audience.
BOULDER CREEK. Cafe, Oct. 3.âMid
dleion s Hail was filled to-night with lum
bermen and millmen and residents of
Boulder Creek, who hsd assembled to
hear Colonel Henry G. Shaw's speech on
the monetary question. Supervisor S. H.
Ram bo. who is a candidate for re-elecion
on the Republican ticket, presided.
Colonel Shaw illustrated his points by
means of cLarts and other devices. One
of his charts showed the increase in as
sessable wealth in Santa Crcz County by
decades since IS7O. Since the ti.eged
crime of 1573 the people of this county, he
said, bad added $10,000,000 in _D.d values
to their property, real and personal- He
asked whether this increase in wealth was
any proof that Santa Crux Count y bad
suffered by tee iact that since 1573 the
control of tbe coinage of sliver had been
restricted to the Government. By means
of another chart he demonstrated that toe
greatest money power in California were
the depositors in all the banks â commer
cial and savin ts â snd tbat any sudden
change of standards would injure them
far more than it would tbe bankers, who, j
in practice, were only trustees, tbe capital
of tbe latter being small ia proportion to
tbe value of deposits.
Colonel SLaw dwelt on the serious con
sequences which would flow from the
working of tbe sptcinc contract law in
California. He said tnat tae only remedy
for the existing situation was the adoi tiou
o; the protective poiicv and a cessation of
what looked like a political warfare drawn
upon otaai and sectional lines.

WOULD SHARE HIS GRAVE.
Attempted Swede of the Woman Who
Caused Tom Wf lie's Domniall â He
Was a B gamist
LOS AXGELES, Cau, Oct. 3.-"I shall
be buried in the same grave with him,"
was the tragic utterance of Fannie Mc-
Bride, the so-called sister of Tom "Wylie,
formerly of Esst Oakland, who committed
suicide in this city last Tuesday night by
taking an overJoseof morphine, "sister
Fannie,"' as Wylie was wont to call her,
had been gazing for some minutes at his
co:d, lifeless form. She shrieked these
words and sank helpless to the floor.
Strong arms bore her from the Morgue
and she was soon revived.
Tnat was en Wednesday. To-day she
attempted to make her threat gooo. "Sis
ter iannie" had been stopping with tbe
family of Edward Leonhardt on South
Los Angeles street. Her grief over the
death of Wylie, to whom she now claims
to have been married, has been touching.
This morning Mrs. Leonhardt offered her
euest a cup of ceffee. Mrs, McÃride or
Mrs, Wylie said:
"No, thank you; I have taken my last
cup of coffee."
"What do you mean?" asked Mrs.
Leonbardt.
"I mean that I hay* taken a large dose
of poison and soon snail be dead."
Mrs. Leoanardt dispatcnea messengers
for two pays c ans, who responded quickly
a: d have been able to prolong the woman's
life up to a late hour to-night.
Mrs. Leonbardt has tacen pains to ex
hibit a marriage license to callers and
newspaper men, indicating that Fannie
McÃr.de and Thomas S. Wylie bad been
married for over three years, in which
ca&e Wylie, in addition to many other
shortcomings, had been a bigamist. Wy
lie's lawful wife, Bessie, and their three
children now ttve with a brother and uncle,
J. M. Hill, on Pico Heights in this city.
The funeral of Wylie was heid to-day.
STAMFORD DAY AT THE FAIR.
University Athletes Play Football and
Musical Clubs Entertain a
Larff9 Audience.
BAN JOSE, Cax., Oct 3.â The crowd at
the Garden City Cyclers' grounds this after
noon witnessed a battle for supremacy on
the gridiron between the Varsity and Col
lege football elevens of Stanford Univer
sity.
Tbe game was a disappointment in
many respects to tbe devotees of the in
flated sphere. Many of the Stanford
best men were net present and Cross, the
celebrated coach from Yale, who was ad
vertised to be present and participate in
the game, was conspicuous by txia ab
sence.
The p:aying was slow throughout the
game, the enthusiasm which usually
characterizes contests of this character
being noticeably absent. This may, per
ha ps, be attributed to tbe day, which was
not an ideal one for footbaJ, the weather
being a Hills too warm for good playing.
During the game several men were In
jured, not seriously, but enough so tbey
had to retire from the field, and their
places were filled by substitutes.
The game resulted in a victory for the
Varsity eleven, the score standing at the
end of the second naif 12 to 0 in their
favor.
Stanford day, which was tbe last day of
the county fslr. closed this evening with a
grand concert at the* pavilion. Tcere was
an attendance estimated at over 2000.
The concert was under the direction of
A. Y. Kaufman, tne leader of the Stanford
g T .?e. mandolin and guitar dubs.
The various selections were well ren
dered. After tha concert the Marine band
entertained the crowds of sightseers at the
fair with a number of selections.

Los Axgkles, Cat, Oct. 3.)
The forest fires in Sierra Madre Moun
tains, north from Pasadena and about
twenty miles from this ci'y, are raging
with unabated fury. It is now known
that triere are two separate and distinct
lines of flames. One of these is almost
directly north from Pasadena, the other is
farther to the east and in an entirely
separate group of mountains, with a fer
tile and well-caitivated valley between.
All manner of reports have been ia cir
cu.stion here to-day as to the destruction
wrought by these fires. One was to the
effect that the Alpine tavern on Echo
| Mountain had been or was about to be con
| sumed. A telephone message from the
; Echo Mountain House late to-nigbi indi
cates that the danger there is past, the fire
being far to the north and east. Scores of
people have gone to the scene of the con
flagration, Â«hich at night forms a grand
and awe-inspiring spectacle.
The Pasadena fire-figtiters were unable
to make any head against the foe to-day,
but renewed tbeir efforts to-night. The
entire Pasadena watersned has been de
nuded of every combustible substance, and
the gravest apprehension is feit as to the
result of tee first heavy rains following
this conflagration.
Tae heat from these fires, located as
they are at a great altitude from the val
leys, has been felt to an unpleasant de
gree at many towns along the line of tbe
Santa Fe Railroad between here and San '
Bernardino. These are Monrovia, Gien- j
dora, Aznsa, Lordsburg, North Ontario j
and Old Cucamonga. As on yesterday |
the fire is traveling to the eastward, leav- '
ing the whole rerion a black," charrerrand
smoldering landscape. Ranchers and bee
raisers are fleeing in every direction, after
burying their personal effects or putting
them iuto caves.
The loss to these people w:ll be irrepar
able. In many cases their entire posses
sions are doomed to be a prey to the
flames. If the more westward conflagra
tion should, by the aid of the wind, be. car
ried rapidly to the east, it will cross a
highly cultivated and thickly settled can
yon, in which case tae destruction would
be tremendous and doubtless involve loss
of life among the settlers.
Bear, deer, mountain lions and cata
mounts in large numbers have sought
safety in the deep canyons and valleys be
low the lines of fire.

tain fires are still razing, although the one
directly back of Pasadena seems to be un
der control. That in San Gabriel Canyon :
grows in volume. I The drivers who took
men to fight the fire have returned. They
S, report that ' the fighters arrived ' just in
time to prevent the flames from reaching
across' the dark canyon. Had the fire
crossed, they say, nothing .would have
saved the range upon which the Echo
Mountain Hotel and the â  Mount Lowe
Railway are located. . Sheets of flame
thirty feet high.- were ? roaring 'â¢ down the
canyon when the party arrived near the
scene, and only after the wind had gone
down ; and the fire bad reached the small
brush could they do ' anything toward
backfirinf. .. ... - .. â  .
A strip twenty miles lone and four miles
wide was burned over. -
Historic Browns Peak, named by Owen
sod Jason Brown, sons of o-'d John Brown
of Ossawattomte, was completely denuded
of vesetation yesterday, and huge sheets
of flames could be seen from Pasadena aa
the stately pines were mowed down. The
Brown brothers lived here for several
years, spending most of their time in the
mountains. Owen died seven years ago
and Jason wen; back East.

BUIBUN, Cjlu, Oei 3.â BinoÂ» the de
cision of the Supreme Court has been re
ceived in the case of the Cordelia Club vs.
William King et al. there has been much
excitement in local sporting circles. The
victory is regarded as a partial one by the
outside huntÂ«rs, many of whom are join-
Ing the Sportsmen's Protective Associa
tion. Bitter feeling has been engendered
by the action of the preserve clubs in bar- i
r icading the sloughe, and hunters look I
with displeasure at the introduction of ;
what ii regarded as an un-American exer
â¢ise of privilege. From time immemorial
the Suisun marshes have been the com
mon hunting ground of all; the poor man
mingled with the rich man and there was
enough sport for all.
Since the Cordelia Club leased the
Chamberlain tract, consisting of 3000 acres,
and inclosed portions of it, there has
been war on the marshes during the duck
shooting season.
It is true the Cordelia and Teal clubs
have inclosed some of tbeir rented prop
erty, but their gamekeepers, it is claimed,
go beyond such territory, where there are
no inclosures, and warn sportsmen to keep
away. C. W. Kellogfj, as trustee of the j
Cordelia Club, brought a case before the â 
Superior Court of Solano County last year j
to restrain persons who were termed ;
poachers from hunting on their erounds.
Judge Buckles denied the injunction,
claiming the plaintiff bad not shewn that
the defendants interfered with his rights,
and that the lease held by him was defec
tive inasmuch as it gave the privilege only
to a certain number of men. Another
point to which the Judge called attention
was the illegal baiting of the ponds. It
was generally expected that Judge Buck
les' opinion would be sustained by the
Supreme Court. In ordering a new trial
the Supreme Court contended:
While these wild birds are within the plain
tiff's inclosure he has, under the statutes, such
rights as entitle him to protect them from in
vasion fry those cot authorized to be there,
and any person violating these rights is as
much a trespasser as though entering unbid
den the plaintiff's dwelling.
Emboldened by their success in the 8u- {
preme Court the Cordelia and Teal clubs
are placing further obstructions in the
way of the so-called trespassers, and it is
expected they will have a strong force of i
gamekeepers on hand by the time the sea- j
aon opens. The sportsmen here, wbiie |
admitting that the clubs have a right to!
all the ducks on the baited ponds, declare !
they are illegally obstructing the navi- I
gable highway. The blockade at the
Frank Horan slough is the bone of con- \
tention. It is claimed this slough is nay- :
igabJe, and funds will be liberally sub- ,
scribed to test the case. The point to be
raised iÂ« whether a combination of rich !
men can obstruct navigable waters for
four months in the year.
The numerous hunters of Vacaviile,
Suisun, Benicia and Vallejo will join the
sportsmen in San Francisco and make a j
strong stand against the clubs. The can
didates of both political parties in Solano
County have been interviewed in regard |
to the English method of monopolizing
the marsh lands and an effort will be
made to pledge them to use their efforts |
to remedy what is regarded as a privilege :
"foreign to the spirit of the constitution." :
It has been stated that in case the Sports
men's Protective Association fails in its
legel action the Board of Supervisors will
pass an ordinance prohibiting shooting
for two or three years. The people of I
this section are bo apprehensive of serious j
trouble resulting from the present state of |
affairs fat nearly everybody favors such i
action by the board, as they consider this j
the only means of preventing possible
bloodshed.
The situation at present certainly lore
sbadows a lively time on October 15.
SANTA BARBARA PRESS SOLD.
Passes Into the Possession of a Stock
Corporationâ A Newspaper With
a History.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 3.â The
Santa Barbara Morning Press has been
â¢old to a stock company, with a capital of
$50,000, and which will be conducted un
der the title of the Press Publishing and
Printing Company. The incorporators
and directors are Isaac R. Baxley, Charles
.A. Edwards, 8. Howard Martin, Louis
Jones and Walter A- Hawley. It is un
derstood that Mr. Martin, a talented
young Eastern man and a Yale graduate,
who has for a year past been identified
with Santa Barbara journalism, will be the
president of the company and the manag
ing editor, while Louis Jones will be the
business manager.
The Press has a long and, in some re
spects, remarkable history. It was first
established as a daily in 1874 by James
Asbury Johnson, now a San Francisco
man and a prominent Populist, who came
here a Congregational t>reacber.
He was followed by Harrison Gray Otis,
now of Los Angeles. J. P. Steams then
purchased the paper, and it was during
bis ownership, in September, 1880, that a
tracedy that startled the entire State was
enacted. Mr. Steams took no active part
in the editorial management of his paper,
but employed tÂ»s editor Theodore Glancy,
a talented young journalist of high char
acter. Glancy was fearless in his con
demnation of evil and espousal of good,
and one day the Press came out with a
stinijinp condemnation of Clarence Grey,
a Santa Barbara attorney. Two days later
Grey shot Glancy dead upon the streets.
He was tried for the crime and succeeded
in obtaining a change of venue to Red
wood City, wherfi a jury acquitted him.
In January, 1881, ft F. McGlashan, after
ward editor of tiie Truckee Republican.pux
chased the paper and edited it success
fully for a time, afterward selling it to
W. G. Kinsell, who, with his talented
wife, conducted the paper for years and
then disposed of a half interest to Walter
Nixon, who died five years ago. Three
years ago the paper was again sold to J.
P. Johnson and George Knepper. Mr.
Johnson, a business man of Santa Bar
bara, retired from journalism after a brief
experience, and for six months Charles
Knepper and Charles McDevitt, the latter
a popular newspaper man of Southern
California, were joint owners of the paper,
when Mr. McDevitt retired and the prop
erty again reverted to the Kneppers. They
sever their connection with it by the
present sale. The pat>er baa always been
â¢ stanch Republican iheet.

and the greatest bluerock shoot in the
world.
The large section of land used for shoot
ing grounds, situated on the Polhemus
Tract West of the Hotel Vendome, and
upon which five electric traps were placed,
was the scene of great activity and shots
were tired in such rapidity that the
grounds resembled the scene of a pitched
battle against a concealed enemy. The
practice shooting commenced early this
morning and continued until it was too
dark to see the bluerocks.
The marksmen tested all of their guns
with the various cartridges ana from the
various traps in order to select the best
agents for securing high scores to-morrow.
The San Jose men practiced very little, in
order to give their guests every facility for
enjoying the practice from the traps.
The Cyclers' Gun Club grounds now
present a village-like appearance. Over a
dozen large tents have been constructed.
Tne largest of these belongs to the cyclers
and is used as general utility headquar
ters. The Olympic Gnn Club of San Fran
cisco has a large tent well stocked with
conveniences and luxuries for the use of
its members and invited guests. Adjoin
ing this is the tent of the Empire Gun
Club of San Francisco.
The Reliance of Oakland, Antioch of
Contra Costra County, Lincolns of Oak
land, Stockton Athletic, Gilroy and. Sa
linas rod and gun clubs have their own
tents. Schilling <fc Son, Colt Fire Arms
Company, Remington Fire Arms Com
pany and San Jose Hardware Company
each have tents and W. D. J. Hambly has
a very large refreshment tent, in which
meals are served.
The twenty-five traps which throw
bluerocks are situated behind five wooden
bulkheads. Each of these traps is loaded
by a man in cnarge. The traps are thrown
by an electric apparatus operated by a
trapper who sits just behind the marks
man. Behind each bulkhead also sits a
referee, who decides whether or not the
rocks are broken. The contests to-morr

During the practice upon the grounds
this afternoon a pigeon-hawk took the
liberty of sailing high over the range. C.
C. McMahon of the Olympic Club spied it,
and, instead of shooting ai a bluevock,
lifted his gun and brought the bird to
earth. This was the first live bird that
had crossed the grounds since the advent
of the marksmen, and it was given to F.
H. Holmes to mount as a souvenir of the
occasion.
Hotel Vendome, which is the headquar
ters of the association, has been tastefully
decorated for the reception of the gunners.
Blnerocks are used in forming the device,
"Welcome C. I. T. A.," and festoons of
streamers made of empty cartridge-shells
are suspended tastefully about tne hotel
office and in the saloon.
There are among the visiting marksmen
many 'of Bt*te renown. Among them are
J. W. Shiel of the San Joaquin Gun Club,
who won the high-average medal at both
the Oakland and Stockton meets and cap
tured the Gold Dust medal at Oakland a
year ago.
Martinez Chick of Los Angeles also won
a gold medal in Stockton, and has the
honor of defeating Dr. Brewer, one of the
celebrated shots of the world, in a live
bird contest. J. 8. Fanning of San Fran

live-bird contest me ial at San Bruno.
Otto Fendner of San Francisco holds the
Fay diamond live-bird contest medal and
the Olympic Club record medal for oreak
ing ninety-six bluerocks out of ]00.
Charles" Hass of Stockton, one of the
oldest marksmen of the coast, holds his
team individual championship medal.
Charles Merrill of t;.e San Jose team has
more championship medals than he can
place upon tne front of his vest. W. A.
Seaver (Trombone) won the State champ
ion individual medal in Oakland and the
Golcher medÂ»l in Stockton. G.W. Hinckle

PASSED MANY FORGED CHECKS.
San Jose Business Men Swindled by a
Young Man Whose Living Expenses
Exceeded His Income.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. B.â A. de Chazen,
who was formerly employed as bookkeeper
at the cream of tartar works on Bush
street, in this city, is held in the City
Prison on a charge of forgery. It is be
lieved bis forgeries will reach nearly $800,
ranging in sums from $20 to $100.
De Chazen, who is a rather sporty young
Frenchman, and said to be well connected
in France, wan employed as bookkeeper
by Mr. de Latour for several years. For a
while De Chazen lived at the Saint Claire
Club, but this pace was too hot for his
salary as bookkeeper, and in order to
m eet his debts he was compelled to forge
his employer's name to several small
checks. Mr. de Latour paid tne notes,
and about a month ago he was discharged.
Last Thursday he cashed a $75 check at
the Farmers' Union, and when it was pre
sented at the First National Bank it was
pronounced a forgery. Manager Andrews
of the Farmers' Union then laid the mat
ter before Chief Kidward and an investi
gation was begun. De Chazen could not
be found, but Mr. de Latour, In order to
save him from prosecution, paid the
amount of the check.
The matter had been scarcely squared

few left from last week's offering ao. 1
when Turel <fe Co. of the City Store com
plained of having been defrauded out of
$75 on a similar check. So anxious was
De Chazen to get the money that he offered
to discount the check. Brassy & Co. also
reported having a $20 check of De Chazen'*
on hand.
On Thursday De Chazen went to San
Francisco, and whi}e there is believed to
have worked off a $100 check on the
strength of Mr. de Latour' s credit, and
yesterday he returned to this city. Last
night he got a $50 check cashed by John
Corrotto, the North Market street liquor
dealer, and within an hour Mr. Corrotto
ascertained that it was a forgery, having
submitted the check to the bank teller.
It was learned that De Chazen had pur
chased a ticket for El Paso, Tex., ana in
tended to leave the city. Chief Kidward
at once placed an officer at the depot, and
this morning Da Chazen was arrested as
he was about to board the 5:45 a. m. train
for Oakland at the broad-gauge depot. At
'.he City Prison he was found to have
$37 75 on his person and four more forged
checks payable as follows: Forty-five dol
lars to R. Romere, and indorsed in that
name; $50 and $35 to himself, and $45 to
JP. Lassere, and indorsed in that name.
All these checks were signed with De
Latonr'? name. De Chazen admits his
guilt, but says everything will come out
all right.

PORTLAND WIFE MISSING.
Left a Letter Declaring She Would
Commit Suicide.
PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 3. â Charles
Hunt, an employe of the Albina Eleva
tor Company, has been abandoned by his
wife of six weeks and reported to the po
lice to-day his suspicion that she is dead.
His theory is based upon the subjoined
letter Mrs. Hart left for him yesterday
noon:
Mr. Hart: No doubt you will be surprised
that the bird has flown. But the gilded cage
was gold but a day, and you have caused ma
and mine much sorrow. May God give you
what you rightly deserve. You say you were
a Christian before you met me, and now that
I am gone you may retrace your steps. You
talked last Friday about jumping into the
river. Meet me there; it Is big enough to
hold me. too. The 10 cents you gave me when
we married will take me to a good place to
make the plunge. â¢ * â¢ My ring I leave
you. It has not been off my finger since
you put it there, but It will never get on
again. My clothes you can take home, so they
can be used lor children or some one else, as
I will never need them more. * â¢ â¢ It will
not be long till we meet in heaven, I hope,
and may the Lord forgive you.
If my body is found, dress me in my wedding
dress. You can tell Mamma why I have gone.
You know what a devil you have been to me.
Emma.
P. B.â Had I money I might try to live, but
life is too hard to begin all over again.

DIMOND IS A POPULIST
Received Into the Full Faith
of the People's Party-
Last Night.
His Right to the Unrestricted Ran cf
the Fold the Sabj ct of
Warm Debate.
Joseph I. Dimond is not as choice a
morsel to many cf the Populists as be is
to the Buckley wing of the Democratic
. party. This was demonstrated last night
I at the meeting of the County Committee
j of the People's party of San Francisco,
! when Joseph Asbury Johnson introduced
j a resolution indorsing Buckley's candi
} date for Mayor and adopting him into the
I Populist party.
The first business of importance was the
consideration of the report made by B. G.
I Haskell of the committee on board of
| election. He reported mat while the
j Populists were entitled to have two repre
i sentatives in the booth of each precinct,
j or about 700 election officers in all, But 500
names of Populists had thus far been filed
with the .Election Commission.
He moved that his committee be em
powered to expend $50 in the work of dis
covering men* who would be willing to
serve as guardians of tne Populists' inter
ess on election day for $10. Several of
the members reported a difficulty in find
ing Populisis in every precinct, and it was '
suggested, Â» n d the suapest on was favor- {
ahly received, that silver Democrats and I
S silver Republicans who could be trusted, ;
j if then* were any such to be found, be i
j recommended for tnese appointments.
Mr. Hasfceli further reported that five ;
I attorneys had been engaged to prepare j
I papers and procure the arrest of all per- â 
sons who attempted to defraud the Popu- |
â  lists on election day. He informed the ;
committee that two Police Judges had j
agreed to be on hand so that the warrants I
of arrest could be iysued at once.
Then Joseph Asbury Johnson cast the ;
I apple of discord into the meetine. He in
; troduced a series of tnree resolutions. 'â â 
i The first read, in part, as follows:
"We recognize in Joseph I. Dimond, the !
' candidate of the People's party of San j
; Francisco for the office of Mayor, a gen- |
| vine, boid and uncompromising anti- j
monopolist and B rj. an " Democrat and!
i avowed Populist of unimpeachable inttg- I
rity."
The second resolution indorsed the mv- !
i nicipal land legislative tickets of the Peo- ;
I pie's Party Convention of San Francisco, !
! and promised them tde full support of the i
County Committee.
The last resolution made "Anti-mo- J
I noply, stand by the people.' the battle- i
cry of the Populists in the coming cam
paien.
When it came to the adoption of these
resolutions opposition at once arose to the !
first. B. J. P"ye led the kickers. He de- '
clarÂ«d that Dimond was no Populist and J
thÂ»t the County Committee had no richt
to baptise him into the iaiih. This raised i
a howl of appfovai from many of the ;
members, and the Populism of* Dimond
was the subject of a lone and somewhat i
heated debute. It was finally brought out ;
that he had not oniy placed himself ':
firmly on the Buckley platform, but had .
agreed to protect every plank intuePopu- :
lists' platform also. On this showing he â 
was allowed to be endowed with the ere- j
dentials prepared for him by Johnson, .
and all the resolutions were adoptad. The >
committee adjourned till next Saturday ;
nigh: at 915 V Market street, where the
executive committee of the County Com- i
mlttee will meet on Tuesday evening.
Bolstering Free Silver.
An enthusiastic gathering of Bryan j
Silverites assembled at Coak ley's Hall on
Geary ;treÂ»t last night for the purpose of
organizing a Free Silver Club for the
Fortieth District. After considerable
speechmaking the following temporary j

Charles B. Norton, chairman.
Among the many names enrolled were

trict Free Silver Club will be held at Coak

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
DOBBERTIN MAKES
A PUN IN MARBLE
A Satire on Fred Yates'
Feeling of Infalli
bility.
"Satyr and Cupid," a Droll Piece
of Work by the Sculp
tor.
"MY BOY, YOU ARE AN ARTIST"
These Words Inspire Dobbertin to
Fashion Wet Cay Into a
Witty Repartee.
Otto Dobbertin, tbe sculptor, has re
cently completed a piece of work that
provokes much comment in artistic
circles.
It is the bust of a satyr, who holds his
head back and smiles at a little cupid
standing on tiptoe at the foot of the
pedestal and reaching up tickles tbe
throat of the satyr with a straw. The
satyr looks as though he were born to be
"The Satyr and a Cupid," by Otto Dobbertin.
pleased, and the little cupid seems exert
ing every effort to do so. The smile of the
satyr is so self-satisfied and the expres
sion cf tne enpid is so anxions that the
effect is drolL
Dobbertin says he never molds anything
from the plastic clay unless there exjÂ«ts
behind bis fingers a well-defined fueling or
thought that needs external fixing. It is
perhaps this that makes the sketch oi the
satyr and the cupid particularly interest
ing and renders it a delicate piece of good
natured satire. In fact, there is a story
connec ed to it.
When Fred Yates, the English artist,
was in the City a short time ago he visited
Dobbertin's studio. He looked at the
"Degeneration" and was delighted. He
fixed his monocle to his right eye and
gazed on the "Kiss of Death."
"Dobbertin," said he, holding his head
back and smiling while be laid his hand
patronizingly on the shoulder of the sculp
tor â "Dobbertin, my boy, it is true you
are an artist."
The words were sincere enough, but the
tone and the attitude were of the nature
that makes the full-grown man feel like a
little boy when he listens to them. The
tone tickled the sculptor exceedingly, as
he s.iid afterward.
It ticfcled him so much that he began to
imagine the real feeling in the mind of
the great painter. The thought became
very scrong in his mind, so strong really
that as soon as Yates had departed, Dob
bertin rushed to a lump of wet clay and
beean with facile touches to show his
fellow artists how he felt.
When a brother artist came in soon
after, he looked at the sketch a moment
and said : "A satyr's nose is not bent that
way, Dobbertin." and then after looking
at it longer, said: "Oh, that's Yates,"
and so Dobbertin has perpetrated a pun in
marble. He has good-naturedly satirized
tr.e feeling of infallibility in an English
BAIL FOB WILLIAMS.
The Supreme Court Granted His
Attorney's Plea Late
Yesterday.
Will Be Released Tc-Morrow and
Counsel Sanguine Now of a
N.w Tria".
Dick Williams has been admitted to
bail. The efforts of his attorneys in bis
behalf have be*n indefatigable. It will be
remembered that Judge Morrow refused
Williams bail and that Judges McKenna
and Field, out of courtesy to Judge Mor
row, did likewise.
Collins prepared s bill of exceptions,
properly certified to, and went to Wash
ington last Monday. It is understood that
the prosecuting officers sent documents to
nullify the effect of whatever facts Collins
might present to the Supreme Court.
Collins arrived at Washington yester
day and presented his certificate to the
Supreme Court. Trie Supreme Court im
mediately admitted Williams to bail in
the sum of $3000 on each charge-
The order admitting 'Williams to bail
was made yesterday, bat, as tbe Supreme
Court closes at 12 o'clock, it waa too late
then to seed the order admitting Mm to
bail on to tbe clerk of the District Court
here. Therefore tbe oidsr admitting Wii-
Haras to bail will be telegraphed here
to-morrow.
The facts mentioned were telegraphed
yesterday to William M. Madden, Collins'
associate.
Botb Collins and Madden are confident
that this action oo the part of the Su
preme Court means that Dick Williams
will be granted a new trial.
Fan at Sutro Baths.
Those who have seen the seals and the Sutro
Baths are offered additional inducements to

gramme of sports and stage humor will be
presented. There will be a fifty-yard race for

in the finish fight that fell through. Then
there is to be high diving by Schulte and
Bailey, the champion high divers of thp Pacific
Coast, and a match game of water polo between
the California Swimming Club and the Del
Monte Water Polo Club. But the special fea
ture is to be a "marvelous disappearing act,"
performed by Correll and Empey, the bur
lesque comedians.

lie Leonard, who lives next door, saw the act
attempted. She nurrJed and extinguished
the flames and called the officers, who made
the arrest.

QUEEN MAKES FEW MISTAKES.
| Why Her Opinion Is Respected by All
of Her Subject*.
Just think of the blunders all living
monarchs have made, even Francis Jo
seph of Austria, whom men now account
a nestor, and all the premiers of our time,
and then reflect on this reign, in which
there has never been a blunder great
enough to be perceptible to the million
eyes which always watch a court, says the
Spectator. I: seems to us that wholly
apart from the difficult question of the
proper limits of loyalty to an individual,
there is enouch in the known facts to jus- I
tify ail the reverence with which the
Queen Is regarded and which extends far
beyond the limit of her scepter, wide as
the limit has now become.
Foreigners occupy in many respects the
t position of posterity, and among foreign
ers capable of judging the reverence for
the Queen is at least as great aa in Eng
! land, her opinion when known to foreign
courts weighing at least aa heavily as it
does, with her own Ministers. This is due,
say several of our contemporaries, to the
intermarriages which have made her Ha
jeaty the common ancestress in so many
courts, in every court, indeed, not strictly
; catholic, and no doubt the strange posi
tion of the Queen in that respect is one
reason for the special honor in which she
is held abroad, but it is not the principal
one. Relatives can hate one another very
hard, and the Queen is as greatly respected
in Washington or New York as in Berlin
or St. Petersburg.
Her Majesty is ereat because her reign
has been greatâ great in its enterprises,
ereat in its successes, great, above all, in
tnat compatibility which, owing mainly
to the character of the sovereign, it has
snown fefbe possible between a more than
republican freedom and monarchial in
stitutions. The British empire is the
greatest object lesson ever given to the
world to show tnat a state can enlarge its
borders without living under tyranny and
without universal military service.
Jilted by Famous Men.
It is a curious fact that there are several
women here who rind a source of gratifica
tion in advertising that they have been
jilted by famous â¢ men. %JC-- former sweet
heart ol ' John C. Caihoun is an inmate of
Louise f Home. She * has jai Tint; Â£ that he
gave her, a lock of hair and other memen
tos of an early engagement and she likes
to tell the story of her love affair. ;
Another woman here was once engaged
to James Buchanan and might have been
mistress of the White House had she been
so inclined. She does ; not advertise the
fact, however, but the ; story is related by
her friends to explain the reason why she
prefers to remain a recluse rather than oc
cupy the social position which her wealth
and accomplishments would , command. â

THE BIG FAIR
IS NOW CLOSED
A Brilliant Victory Won
for the Cause of Home
Industry.
Over Two Hundred Thousand
People Attended During
the Month.
AN OBJECT LESSON TAUGHT.
Closing Scenes Fnll of Life and in
Keeping With the Entire
Exposition.
The Home Industry Exposition at the
Mechanics' Pavilion closed last evening in
a blaze of glory and ft din tfiat sounded
like Bedlam turned loose. Never in the
history of the City has there been a fair of
this kind so successful or productive of
such good results.
Tne intention of the Mechanics' Insti
tute and the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association was to present the
fact to the public that the manufacturers
of California can produce as good, if not
better, than any in the world. The lesson
has been received and has been appre
ciated.
The conclusion of the exposition was in
keeping with the occasion. The Pavilion
waa thronged from 8 to 11 o'clock with
visitors and when the orchestra finished
"Home, Sweet Home" the engineer in the
boiler-room pulled the cord of a large
steam whistle, which made such a noise
that even thinking had to be suspended
for the time. Nearly all the booths were
specially decorated in gay colors, which
made a beautiful and striking scene, and
large numbers of visitors were presented
with bright-hued ribbon badges by the ex
hibitors. There was less dissatisfaction
among those interested iv the fair than in
former years.
Aiter the crowd began to leave the build
ing a number of exhibitors nave a banquet
in honor of the management. This be
came a reunion, for the management gave
a banquet to the members of the band.
Speeches were made by Leader Hinricbs,
AUred Roncovieri. Joseph Cummine, R.
P. Doolan, E. A. Denicke and several
others. Before departing the band sere
naded the directors.
Aa staled the affair was a success, and
some idea of the nature of the success
may be obtained when it is learned that
during the month of the exposition over
200,000 persons entered tbe Pavilion.
Of these 90,000 were paid single admis
sions and over 60,030 were children from
the public and parochial schools. The
others were holders of season tickets, ex
hibitors, etc. Although the price of a
single admission was reduced to 25 cents
and the expense was ;enormous, several
thousand dollars was cleared by the man
agement.
Tbe largest profit, to the community
and to the manufacturers, cannot be esti
mated at once. About 14,000 persons
signed the manufacturers' and producers'
pledge to patronize home manufacturers
whenever possible, and the display of such
a variety of tirst-class home-made articles
and goods proved an object-lesson the
public will not soon forget.
Modern Boat Building.
An exhibit at the Mechanics' Fair that
is particularly worthy of special comment
by reason of the superiority of workman
ship is the display made in boat building
by George Kneass. The gasoline launch
on exhibition is indeed a masterpiece 1 ,
while the row boats are models of perfec
tion. Mr. Kneass has been building boats
since 1376 aud he has produced the finest
of all classes and sizes on our bay. His
office and works of the establishment is at
713 Third Btreet.

VANISHED THEIR
DREAM OF GOLD,
How a Brave Little, Band
of Miners Failed in
Alaska.
They Fitted Out an Expedition
Last April, but Cooks Inlet
Fooled Them.
RETURN OF THE PROSPER.
Disgruntled Miners Who Are Not
Chary of Murmurs Against
Their Recent Chief.
The eighteen men who purchased
shares in the little schooner Prosper and
went on a rold -hunting expedition last
April got back home yesterday.
They are very bitter again*t the man
who induced them to mortgage their
homes and use other means of raising
money in order to reach the new El
Dorado, and should they lay hands on
him there will be trouble. The statement
of the returned gold-miners is as follows:
Last winter a man named F. C. Bender of
Berkeley eilveriised for a party of men to go to
the Alaskan guldflelds. In Rnswer to in
quiries he informed applicants that he would
lake them to a claim in Alaska that would
pay good dividends, if not a sma^l fortune.
Eighteen of us paid him $100 apiece each for
& hiiare in his schooner ProsDer, in addition to
paying for the provisions and ou'fit.
We sailed from San Francisco April 6, but
stress or weather compehtd us to put into
Drakes Bay twice. Owing to dissatisfaction
we returned to San Francisco April 19 and
engaged Captain Robert Quiuton in lieu of
Captain Holm and sailed again on April 26.
We encountered nearly all head win-Is and
gales until May 27, -wnen we anchored near
Point Steele, Alaska, and prospected for two
days and found nothing. Bender then in
formed us that his great secret place was
Resurrection Bay, to which place we pro
ceeded, arriving June 1. We prospected all
around and found nothing. Bender then
coolly Informed us that there was nothing
there. We then deposed him from the man
agement of the business and elected Y. E.
Corder manager. We then proceeded to Turn
again Arm, Cooks Inlet, and landed after a
protracted and desperate battle with the mos
quitoes.
\\\i found the whole country located, but
there were plenty of Ciaims to be leased or
purchased. We also found hundreds of idle
men and millions of busy mosquitoes, but no
gold.
Bender had tried secretly to divide the party
and abandon the others and start out with
two or three of the men on his own account;
his scheme did not work, whereupon he
abandoned us altogether.
After prospecting all around the country we
finally leased a clsim of Martin Chester, on
Resurrection where we turned the
stream and worked the river bed for one week,
sluicing, but we found practically nothing.
Discouraged and disgusted we then deter
mined to return borne. We left Hope City ou
August 8 with a number of passengers for
Siika. We encountered head winds and a
succession of southeast gal-s, the most of
which occurred on August 23 and SO. We
rigged out a sea drag and hove to under bare
poles for twenty hours. For the first six
hours the wind blew with hurricane force.
Captain Quinton, who had weathered many
hurricanes, says hÂ« never experienced such a
gale. But our schooner acted splendidly ai.d
iiot-a single sea broke on beard.
We reached Sitka on September 6 and left
for Sau Francisco September 11 with line
weather but head winds aii ihe time, and ar
rived in due time safe and sound. We owe our
most grateful tuanks to Captain Quinton, who
brought us through all right.
K. E. Corder, H. C. Shock, C. R. Olsen, John
F. Voyler, C. Christensen, A..F. Plainer, A. E.
Corder. â¢
F. C. Bender, a prosperous carpenter,
living on University avenue, near Sacra
mento street, conceived the idea of the
expedition and succeeded in getting seven
other citizens of Oakland and Berkeley
interested in the scheme. These seven
men were F. E. Corder, a foreman in the
empioy of the judson Company; H. C.
Shook, an Oakland route-agent for a San
Francisco newspaper; Charles Olsen, an
employe of th? Judson Company ; John
F. Voyler, an Oaklander; 0. Christensen,
a San Francisco wharfinger; A. F. Plat
ner, another Oakland man, and A. E.
Corder, also of the Judson Company.
There were eleven others who became co
partners in the scheme.
After prospecting for a while they be
came discouraged and disgusted, and
finally set sail for home, leaving Hope
City on August 8. They reached Sitka on
September 6, and left for San Francisco on
the lltu, arriving here last night.
Bender has been in the City for nearly
two months. On one occasion the miners
held a mtetins and threatened to lynch
him, Â»o he made his escape and came to
Sar. Francisco. There is now sure to be
litigation, as the miners hold me con
trolling interest, and Bender, as the
holder of a one-third interest, is listed as
managing owner.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
The American Ship Centennial, That Had to Come Around the Cape of Good Hope in Order to Reach
San Francisco, and the Schooner Prosper, That Brought Back Eighteen Disgruntled Gold-
Hunters From Alaska. Both Vessels Got in Yesterday.
NEARLY MADE
A NEW RECORD
The Centennial Was Two
Hundred Days From
New York.
Captain Colcord Had to Take His
Vessel Around the Cape of
Good Hope.
MORE MINERS RETURN.
Arrival of Two Schooners From Pros
perâOne From the Alaskan
Fisheriesâ Varying Luck
The American *hip Centennial got in
from New York yesterday. On one occa
sion she was in desperate straits, and the
cargo shifted. The captain put into
Montevideo and repaired damages. The
reuort of the voyage is as follows:
Sailed from New York March 17. On March
29, in latitude 39 Oeg. 40 miii. north, lonei
lude 70 deg. west, had several fresh gales.
Took east trade winds in latitude 24 deg.
north ai.d carried them to the equator.
Crossed the equator on April 17. Had
fre^h southeast trades thence to latitude
20 degr. south. Had light variable winds to
latitude 37 deg. south. Had a heavy v.est
sonthwest gaie, with a hisli cros*-sea. Ship
laboring heavily, filling decks to the rail and
getting water in the main tanks, aud shifted
cartro.
. Had to run the ship before the w'nd 250
miles to trim cargo. Put into Montevideo on
May 21 and sailed on the 31st."
Had the usual weather in the South Atlan
tic. Passed Cape of Good Hope on June 23.
Crossed the Indian Ocean in latitude 3d to 39
south with cloudy weather and westerly gales.
On August 3 passed through Bass Straits in
South Pacific; had moderate t<outh winds.
Passed to the northward of New Zealand and
to the eastward of the Friendly Islands.
Auguest 10 took southeast trades, which
were very light and well to the eastward.
Crossed the equator on August 28 in longitude
100 west. Had light northeast trades from
latitude 2 north to latitude 32 north. On Sep
tember 7 passed four miles to the westward of
Nuhau Islands. In the North Pacific had very
light winds.
Considering that the vessel went around"
the Cape of Good Hope, she made a smart
passage. There is the usual amount of
srumbling aboard and Captain Colcord
had to put some of the men in irons in
order to maintain discipline. The trio
around the Capo of Good Hope was a long
one, but the ship has made* better time
than some of the vessels that left before
her, considering the distance covered.
The Centennial is now an old timer and
the chances are that she will never make
another trip around the Horn. When her
cargo is discharged shd will probably be
sold to the highest bidder.
There are two schooners Prosper in port.
One is from the Alaskan fisheries and the
other is from the Alaskan cold mines.
The men on the former made over $100
bonus, while those on the latter are $100
and more out of pocket. Tne Centennial
was lying at anchor in the stream when
the gold-hunters passed up the bay in the
Prosper.
The tjasoline schooner Monterey, which
got in from Bowens Landing yesterday,
went on the Presidio shoal on her way up
the bay. It was during the fog and tne
captain did not consider the matter of
sufficient importance to hire a tug. The
vessel was li^ht and on the next tide she
driited off and went to her dock.
The steamer Mariposa is one of the
handsomest steamers on the water front.
Yesterday she was ia holiday attire and
looked as spick aud span as a yacht. She
had been newly painted and the brass
work around her deadlights flashed in the
sun like burnished bronze. As the Zea
landia is to go out of commission. Captain
Hart, who was her commander, Will go
out as chief officer of the Mariposa.
The passengers who were on the TJma
tilla wnen she went on the rocks in Pujiet
Sound have sent the following letter to
The Call:
September 29, 1896.
On board steamer Umatlila. We, the under
signed, passen%ers on board tha steamship
Uuiatilla, wish to express our heartfelt thanks
to Captain Hunter, Captain Lloyd (the Dilot)
and Chief Engineer Lacey and the entire crew
of the Umatilla.
The perfect discipline displayed in prepar
ing the boats for leaving the ship speaks vol
umes to the passengers, and we deem this a
fitting moment to express a lasting obligatiou,
believing that the accident could not have
been averted on account of the heavy fog and
tne failure of the log-signal at Point Wilson to
warn us of our dangerous position until after
the ship had struck the reef and then when
first heard It was very faint.

The bark Leon, formerly the Nicaraguan
bark Don Carlos, is now loaded with lum
ber and anchored in the stream, bound for
Fremantle, Australia. The lumber is for
the Coolgardie gold mines, and should
bring good prices there. The L-on was
purchased from the estate of Nick Bichard
some time ago by Joseph Hume. The
-latter sold her to J. J. Moore & Co., ana it
is the latter firm that has loaded her for
Australia. The Don Nicholas, a sister
ship to the Leon, is now an ark at Tiburon,
and the widow of the deceased Nick
Bichard is using it as a residence.
A private letter from the bark Qayhead
shows that Captain Foley has done well
so far. By the last steamer the whaler
sent down 2203 pounds of bone, and there
is now over 1300 pounds more on the way.
After her first shipment from Dutch Har
bor, the Gayhead could not set out again
on account of calm weather. The revenue
cutter Rush towed her twenty-five miles
out to sea, and almost as soon as the lines
were cast off a whale was sighted. Boats
were lowered from the Gayhead, and the
mammal was captured. The bone was
sent ashore on tbe revenue cutter, and
Captain Foley headed for the Arctic.
According to the letter, the steam
whaler William Bayliss had not been hav
ing a good time. The crew had mutinied,
and the captain had had to make the best
of tbe situation. One whale was taken,
but the prospects for a successful season
were not good.
James Milder, mate of the steam
sciiooner Crescent City, does not want any
more bicycle riding. Last trip he tooic a
"bike" along with him and on his arrival
at Crescent City went out to astonish
the natives. According to him he col
lided with a bear but others say it was a
calf. In any event the bicycle is ruined
and Milder says he will never ride again.
STILL TWO ACHING VOIDS
The Citizens' Non - Partisan
Ticket Has a Couple of
Blanks.
Headquarters in the Nuc'eus Build
ing Have B;en Secured by the
County Committee.
The Non-Partinan Connty Committee,
appointed on Friday night by George K.
Fitch, chairman of the Non -Partisan Con
vention, held its first meeting yesterday
morning in ex-Mayor Ellen's office. The
first business undertaken was the election
of ofiicers. Mr. Fitch was unanimously
chosen chairman of tho committee, with
A. S. Hallid:e as vice-chairman and I.
Milliken'as secretary.
The two blanks on the ticket were al
lowed to remain, tbe committee not being
able lo agree regarding nominees to the
Assembly from the Thirty-sixth and Forty
third districts. McGrath, the proposed
candidate from the Thirty-sixth, was not
indorsed because he refused to sign the
pledge exacted by the convention, while
Dennery, the man suggested for nomina
tion^frora the Forty-third, was dropped
from the list on motion of E. J. Le
Breton, who said in general terms that he
waa most objectionable for a number of
reasons.
The committee is making preparations
for a vigorous campaign. A candidates'
meeting is to be held in the near future,
whereat routes will be prepared for speak
ers and otber plans for campaign work
formulated.
Commodious headquarters for the com
mittee have been secured in the Nucleus
building, at the junction of Third and
Market streets, east of Thb Call's new
building. The headquarters will be
thrown open to the public on Tuesday of
this week.

SPEECHES FOR
A FORLORN CAUSE
Judge Ferral Talks Shrilly
for the Bourbon
Idea.
Advocates a Platform Even More
Radical Thaa That of the
Popocrats.
DOWN ON ELECTOEAL COLLEGE
A,n Hour of Anecdotes and a Plea for
the Wandering Candidate From
the Platte.
There was a Democratic gathering at
Metropolitan Temple last night which
was largely permeated with Republican
sentiment, judging by the coldness with
which some of tbe attacks on McKinley
and protection were received.
Franklin K. Lane called the meeting to
order, and he was followed in a brief ad
dress Dy Charles S- Peery, candidate for
Assembly in the Thirty-eighth District,
though Robert Ferral waa the princi
pal speaker of the evening.
Mr. Eane held that the election of Mc-
Klnley would be "not for the Nation's
honor, but for its destruction; not for the
glory of our flag, but for its disgrace."
Continuing in that line of illustration
the speaker said: "The corporations,
trusts and monopolies are opposed to
Bryan, so that he now becomes a hero,
the champion not of free silver alone, but
of the free ballot."
Candidate Peery followed in a brief but
pleasing address, wherein he held that he
was of the opinion that partisanship had
haj-piJy been forgotten this year in the
wider realm of citizenship.
"We have broken away from the old
lines," he said, "and the grand old party
was broad and courageous enough at Chi
cago to break away from the evil influ
ences that controlled it as they had in
fested the Republican party." The senti
ment was cheered and the speaker con
cluded with an appeal for "Bryan and
liberty."
When ex-Judge Ferral was presented
there wore three cheers for him. The
veteran of bourbonism gracefully bowed
his acknowledgment to the acclamations
of the galleries and proceeded to entertain
the audience with a number of his cam
paign anecdotes, revised to date. The
speaker said he was in bad voice, and he
begged the audience to excuse him from
discuasing the silver question seriously.
"Now they are noldine my poor friend
Barne3 responsible for his Bilyer speeches,
but they are wrong. Barnes came out for
silver on St. Patrick's day, and any man
who holds another responsible for St. Pat
rick's day utterances is unfair. [Laugh
ter.] But people are changing the other
way. I pledge you my word that in thirty
years I have never seen so many changes.
The country is alive with silver Demo
crats, men wno would die for Bryan,
In Los Angeles alone there are 2500 Re
publicans in one Bryan club, and that
shows bow the State will go. [Wild yells
and great cheering.]
"Now there are Republicans in Maine
and Vermont; Vermont, the Green Moun
tain State. I tbink it is the greenest State
in tha Union [lauphter], but if you put up
the Maine and Vermont majorities against
those of Arkansas and Alabama you will
be snowed under by 20,000, and nearly two
to one in the Electoral College.' 1
The speaker then explained that the
Chicago platform was too tame for him.
"I wanted it to be a wild outburst of
radicalism," he said, "so that it would/
stand forth beyond question. I wanted it
to do away with the two-thirds rule and
ask for the abolishment of the Electoral
College, a thing that throttles freedom in
this country."
The speaker answered the objection that
Bryan was a young man, by naming Clay,
Jefferson, Patrick Henry, William Pitt,
Robert Emmet and others who become
great ere they grew old. He dwelt on the
benetits of the income tax, touched gin
gerly on free trade, denying that the Wil
son bill was such a measure, and then
pleaded for everybody to give Bryan a fair
chance because "he is brave and" manly."
He believed Lincoln was right in his
fear that this country would fall into the
hands of the very wealthy and that the
poor would be enthralled.
In conclusion the ex-Judge pleaded for
an American financial system and prophe
sied that any other scheme would result
in utter subjection to foreign nations. He
spoke of the Populist convention as "a
glorious and independent body of states
men" and concluded with an extravagant

BEN BUTTERWORTH HERE
The Eloquent Ohioan Will
Stump the State for
McKinley.
He Says the Republican Nominee
Wiil Be Triumphantly Elected
in November.
Ex-Congressman Benjamin Butterworth
of Ohio arrived here yesterday and re
mained for a few hours, leaving in the even
ing for Los Angeles. While here he visited
the Bohemian and Union League clubs. The
ex- Congressman is one of the most eloquent
aud effective speakers on the stump, and
one of the boldest of Republicans. He
has been doing yeoman work in Ohio and
otber States for Major McKinley and will
now speak throughout California for the
Presidential nominee of the Republicans.
Mr. Butterworth's home is in Cincin
nati. He entered the Forty-sixth Congress
and has served aimost continuously ever
since. He has long made tue money ques
tion a special study. By profession Mr.
Butterworth is an attorney.
He bas no doubt whatever of the elec
tion of Major McKiniey Dy an overwhelm
ing majority. He thinks he will carry
more than half the States of the Union
and fully two-thirds of the electoral vote.
The Union League Club delegated
Colonel Qeorze Stone to go to Los Angeles
with Colonel Butterworth and remain
with him while he made his addresses in
Southern California. Mr. Butterworth
will speak in San Francisco for the first
time next Saturday night.
The Congressman called on United
States Circuit Judge McKenna and to
gether they went to the football game at
Central Park, wnere Mr. Butterworth's son
was a coach lor the Berkeley team. Mr.
Butterworth is 57 years old. He has bad
a varied experience as a public speaker,
and his addresses will probably draw
throngs to hear him.
He will speak at San Bernardino on
October 5, at San Diego on the 6th, Santa
Ana and Los Angeles on the 7th, Ventura
on the Bth, Fresno on the 9th and at the
Stanford University and San Francisco on
October 10.
"I have been traveling for six weeks and
making speeches," said Colonel Butter
worth. "I spoke in Illinois, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and
Wyoming. A week was spent in each
State, and I never addressed larger- or
more earnest and enthusiastic audiences.
I am satisfied all these States will go
Republican.

heard tbat the Bryan wave had

if ever there were any, has receded and left
Bryan high and dry. The people are

Chicago platform is not the true De

Ex-Congressman Butterworth will, after
stumping California, go to Oregon and
Washington, and then home. He was in
Congress from 1878 to 1891, was chief of

SIT HIMSELF
IN A HALLWAY,
Frederick E. Luty Sends a
Bullet Through His
Head.
The Suicide for Many Years
Prominent in Mining and
Business Circles.
THE CAUSE YET A MYSTEKY.
He Is Said to Have Recently Specu
lated Heavily in Grain and
Real Estate.
Frederick E. Luty, a well-known man in
mining circles, committed suicide yester
day morning by blowing his brains out.
The circumstances surrouuding the terri-
ble tragedy are as peculiar as they are
mysterious, with the result that rumors
of an unpleasant character are floating
about the street.
About 10 o'clock yesterday the employes
of John itosenfeld's Sons, with offices just
FREDERICK E. LUTY t Who Committed Suicide Yesterday by
Sending a Bullet Through His Brain.
over the Anglo-Cftlifornian Bank, were
startled by the sharp explosion of a pistol.
As one man they rushed to the hallway
and there discovered the body of Luty.
From ihe surroundings it was apparent
that he had made careful preparations for
the rash act. Near the wall was perhaps
a score of mail sacks, some partially filled
with letters and papers and awaiting
transportation.
With great care the suicide had removed
some of ihe sacks, leaving just enough to
form a good support for bis back. Mr.
Luty then carefully laid !iis silk hat to one
side and seating himself on the floor with
his back resting comfortably against the
mail Backs fired the fatal bullet into his
head. When the body was found it had
fallen slightly forward, but was otherwise
in a perfectly natural position. The
weapon bad been held in the left hand.
Frederick Luty was one of the best
known stock operators in the City, and in
addition to tnis was largely interested in
mining. He was secretary of several
mining companies, among which maybe
mentioned the following: The Albany
Gold Mining Company, Belmont Mining
Company, Bay State Mining and Develop
ing Company, Bristol Mining Company,
Flat Creek Silver Mining Company, Great
Western Minine Company, Comstock and
the Brodie. So far as known the dead
man's accounts with tnese companies are
in good condition, though it is understood
that an investigation will be instituted
immediately.
It is known that for several months
past Mr. Lutv has been speculating
heavily in wheat and mining stocks.
Whether these ventures have proven suc
cessful can as yet only be guessed at.
Shortly after the body was removed
Thomas I. Atkinson, a grain broker at
337 Pine street, addressed the following
note to the Coroner:
F. Â£. Luty did trade with me some little â not
ali on his own account. He was careful, pru
deat and conservative. His account shows a
small profit, and when there was a loss it was
not all his own. Atkinson.
After writing this Mr. Atkinson disap
peared from his accustomed haunts.
At the office of Mr. Luty, 330 Pine
street, there is not much disposition to
talk about the dead man or his affairs. A.
Gardner, who acted as Luty's secretary,
said: "As far as I know his accounts are
perfectly straight, and I should think he
was worth between^so, ooo and $60,000. It
is true that he did speculate somewhat,
but he was always so careful and con
servative that if he lost it would not af
fect his general business. Mr. Luty had
been complaining for some days past ol
severe pains in the head, and I believe
that his rash act was the result of tem
porary insanity. When he left the office
yesterday he appeared in good spirits. He
might have been short, but I do not be
lieve it. Nothing can be said definitely on
that point until his affairs are thoroughly
investigated."
J. H. Tibbils, a mining engineer, who
has had a desfc in the office of Mr. Luty
for several years, also expressed the be
lief that the suicide was the result of tem
porary insanity. He was equally confi
dent that this derangement had not been
brought about by any financial embar
rassment.
Mr. Luty was a member of the Pacific
Stock Board and has had his office at 330
Pine street for more than fifteen years. It
has been his custovn to reach his place of
business about Â£' a. m., but yesterday
morning he was a few minutes late. The
elevator boy said he appeared very much
worried, failing even to utter his accus
tomed "Good morning." Mr. Luty re
mained in his office about twenty minutes
and then wem directly to the place where
his body was found.
The deceased was born in Tennessee
fifty-one years ago, coming to California
when still a young man. He settled in
Oakland when he, later, married, six
children â four boys and two girls â result
ing from the union. About six weeks opo
Mr. Luty, with his family, moved to 2295
Sacramento street, this City. .
It was learned last night that in addi
tion to Ms grain and stock speculations
Mr. Luty has lately invested heavily in
real estate. It is thought that this turned
out badly and that he saw no way out of
Uie difficulty except to take his own life.
End of a Mad Due.
Officer MfiCurrie of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals was summoned
yesterday morning to 915>j Hayes street
to kill a mad dog. The animal had been
thrown out of a passing cart, and had darted
into the house, where he made great havoc,
tearing the furniture, carpets and bed clothes,
breaking crockery and attempting to devour a
bathtub. There was much excitement in the
neighborhood until the dog's career was end-id
by a pistol shot.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
HAVE DESERTED
THE LINLITHGOW.
England and the United
States Cannot Rescue
Her.
Neither Has a War Vessel in
the Pacific for the
Purpose.
STATUS OF TWO FLEETS.
Meanwhile the Broken-Down Steamer
With Her Valuable Cargo
Is Drifting.
The British tramp steamer Linlithgow
is drifting helplessly in the ocean, and
neither the English nor United States
Government has a ship In the Pacific
available for the disabled vessel's rescue.
The luckless tramp, which left this port
July 31 with a cargo of wheat bound for
England, broke her shaft and since that
time has been at the mercy of wind and
wave.
The propeller jammed aft hard up
against the rudder-post and haugs in that
position in danger of going to the bottom
of the ocean. When it does the ship will
begin to make water and may follow the
propeller down below.
By Captain Petrie's letter, brought from
Acapulco by the San Bias, it was learned
that the Linlithgow was at the writing in
the vicinity cf latitude 6 deg. 12 mm.
north, longitude 108 deg. 27 mm. west.
He stated that it was impossible to
make any repairs and all they could do
was to keep the water out of the ship. The
sea was so rouÃh that the crew could not
even secure the propeller banging under
her counter and could only wait to be
picked up by some rescuing vessel and be
towed either south to Caliao or north
ward into some Mexican port The com
munication was conveyed from the
steamer to Acapulco, a distance of 840
miles, by Uhief Officer Yell in a smuil
boat with five men.
Upon reaching the port the owners of
the Linlithaow were advised of her pre
dicament and the British Government
asked to send one of the British cruisers
now irrthe Pacific to her rescue.
The request came at an unfortunate
time, as the fleet on the station is small
and two of the vessels are ashore them
selves â Pheasant near Vancouver and tbe
Wild Swan near Cailao. Consequently
tne answer was that there were no British
gunboats available fÂ«>r that purpose. Out
of England's vast fleet not avessel for the
rescue of an Engii.sh ship and crew, and so
| the LiniitoÃow drifts helplessly with her

Yesterday the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce telegraphed the following
request to Washington:
To H. A. Hubert, Secretary of the Navy: British
i steamer Linlithgow hence to Europe is broken
I down in latitude t> deg. 13 mm. north, longi
j tude 108 deg. 27 mm. west. Can you on basis
or humanity and international courtesy send

President Chamber of Commerce.
The Navy Department answered
promptly as follows:

To President Craig, Chamber of Commerce, San
Francisco: Department regrets that no vessel
is available for purpose required.

So Uncle Sam is short of ships also in
the Pacific. There are a number of ves
sels repairing at Mare Island, and tbe rest
of the Pacific Coast fleet, with the excep
tion of the Ranger, somewhere in Central
America, and the Adams at Honolulu, are
up north. The Monadnock is at Eureka
attending the fair and the Philadelphia is
at Portland. They are all expected home
soon for repairs. The Thetis in at the
navy-yard, but she is probably booked for
repairs. The Monterey, which was run
into by a Seattle steamer and had one of
her plates dented, is undergoing extensive
repairs. The Corwin is in port, but as
revenue cutters do much work and sel
dom need repairs, she micht be dispatched
to the relief of the helpless Linlithgow,
drifting in latitude 6 north and longitude
108 west, her propeller threatening to
drop away and her pumps keeping the
vessel clear of water.

A THEOSOPHICAL CHANGE
T>r Jerome A. Anderson to Lecture
at Academy of Sciences Hall.
What is looked upon in many quarters
as a most important and quite significant
event is ,thÂ« removal of the Theosophical
Society ot San Francisco from its present
quarters in ihe Flood building and its lec
ture-room in Golden Gate Hall to the
Academy of Sciences building on Market
street.
When the idea of the theosophists be
coming tenants of the Academy of Sci
ences was first considered it was feared
that there existed a prejudice on the part
of the directors of the academy against
the theosophists and their objects. It is
not many years ago that theosophy was
tabooed and derided by modern science,
but since that time such men as Camille
Flammarion, Huxley, Crooks and the
| great electrician, Edison, have not only
recognized theosophy as a science, but
have actually become members and active
workers in the society, and now the San
Francisco branch of the society is to share
the same lecture hall and occupy office
and library rooms in a building dedicated
strictly to scientific pursuits.
The removal of the library and office
will not occur until the middle of the
month, but the society's regular Sunday
evening lecture will hereafter be held in
the academy's handsome and commodi
ous hall on the ground floor. Dr. Jerome
A. Anderson will lecture there tfois even
ing at 8 o'clock.
At least 75 per cent of the trained teach
ers of the London School Board have come
from Church of England colleges.

SUFFERS DEFEAT
Reliance Wins the Match
by a Score of Twelve
to Two.
The Varsity Line Weak and
Unable to Withstand
Heavy Bucking.
OPINIONS OF THE COACHES.
Cross Disappointed in Ransome, and
Butterworth Declares the Men
Are Soft Yet.
The Berkeley varsity football team was
def Ãated yesterday afternoon at Central
Park by Reliance in the first big match
game of the season. The score was 12 to
2, all the points being made in the second
half.
During the first half practically all the
playing was in Reliance territory, and
CHART OF THE PLAY.
The first play is at the top. A wavy line shows where the tall is kicked; a large dot,
where it is downed by Reliance; a straight line, where it is curried; short parallel lines, where
opponents force tne runner back; a line of snail dots, where the ball Is fumbled; across,
where it is downed by Berkeley, and a broken line, where an official moves the ball. The
initial play of the man carrying or punting the ball is on the line of its progress, E standing
for Ransome, Sp for Spence and Hp for Hopper on Berkeley plays; and S for Sexton, Ws for
Wells, It for Middlemas, A for Arlett and W for Walton on Reliance plays.
twice the ball was downed within five
yards of the goal that Berkeley coveted,
yet was unable to reach. Once, after ad
vancing steadily to within a few yards* of
the goal, Eansome tried for a field kick, but
failed to send the ball over the bar, and
Reliance was put in possession of it on
the ten-yard line for a free kick out of
danger.
Berkeley introduced several fresh play
era into the game for the second half, but
the linemen were no match for the
heavier, more experienced and more skill
ful Reliance players, who made two long
series of gams by bucking for a distance
of over fifty-two yariÂ» to a touchdown
without once losing possession of the ball.
The score credited to Berkeley was a
safety touchdown by Arlett of the Reli
ance team, who, after juggling a kick,
forced the ball back of his own goal and
barely prevented tbe Berkeley men from
falling on it and scoring at least four
points.
Reliance bad its best team on the field.
Two of Berkeley's best players, Sherman,
(end or bacK) and Simpson (tackle) were i
not in the game, although practically all
the other more likely candidates had an
opportunity to show what they could do.
Exactly how the ball traversed thÂ«
gridiron field and how and by whom each
advance was made can be seen by refer
ence to the accompanying chart and the
explanation to it, :
following are the -players and their
stripped weights. The men are arranged
as they actually faced each other in the

Cross on the Gams.
The Reliance line was very much
stronger than that of the U. C. The work
of the Reliance backs was especially poor
in handling kicks and seemed to me to
show lack of training in that respect.
Ran some's kicking was a disappoint
ment to me after what I had heard ;of it.
But the line did not protect him. I think
Ransome a good man. The team weak
ened after his retirement at the end of the
first hair.
Reliance outplayed Berkeley every
where except at ends.. Hopper I consider
a crack end and a very promising man.
The U. C. tackles were weak ana seemed
to make no effort to stop the mass plays
of the Reliance team, which formed its
plays quickly and with good effect. As : a
whole the playing of both teams was slow.
It lacked snap. There was, too, a great
deal of biph tackling. The weather was
too warm, though, for good work. . ;
The TJ. C. weakened, as Reliance
strengthened. This was 'so , particularly
in tha second half. It thÂ«n occurred, to
m Â« that Reliance, from its showing, might
have tried punting earlier in the game, for j
the fullback's kicks were by no means
poor. I had beard of Walton as an old
Stanford player and I admired bis work.
It also seemed to mo that the Berkeley
men were nervous at first.
Harry P. Cross, Yale '96.
Coach Stanford University team.
Butterworih'B View*.
Reliance simply outplayed us; beat us
fairly and Equarely. The men showed
signs of considerably more training than
the Berkeley boys. There was more
unity in their playing than in ours. Their
line was strong.
It is too early in the season to play the
teams reenlar thirty-five-minute halves,
as the men are comparatively soft yet.
That is why the halves were made twenty
five minutes by agreement of the cap
tains.
All I can do this early in the season is
simply to generalize in this way. I:
would not be fair to the Berkeley men to
criticize their individual playing now.
Feakk Bdtteewoeth, Yale '95,
Coach University of California Team.
Captain Walton's Comments.
The Reliance men did not play well to
gether in .he first half, but when they be
gan to work more as a team in the second
halt they went through the Berkeley line
at will. I think that was evident to every
spectator. The Reliance ends were poor,
but the Berkeley ends did beautiful work,
especially in getting down the field on
kicks.
Both the university tackles were weak.
The whole line was weak and did not hold
together, particularly in tne last hulf,
when the Reliance linemen were able to
make big holes for the backs to go through.
Of the new men on the Reliance tr-am
Wells did remarkably good work, and it
was his first big game, too. The line
bucking of Carter was especially good,
and he did lots of it.

MISSION DEFENSE CLUB,
Circumscribing the District in
Which the High School
Should Bo Lccated.
A Mass-Meeting io Boom the Charter
to Bs Held Next Saturday
Evening
Tha Mission Defense Club held a meet
ing last night, at which a boundary within
which it was deemed advisable to locate
the new high school was decided on.
In order that there should be no mistake
on this question, William Metzner offered
the following resolution, which was car
ried:
Resolved, That in meeting assembled the
Mission Lic-fense Uuion opposeÃ the location of
the Mission High School in either of the
blocks of land ;ormerly used as cemeteries.
We believe there is danger to the health of
the children that may attend a school buiit
upon land so recently occupied for burial pur
poses.
We believe a more central location can be
had, and recommend that the feite selected be
situated between Eighteenth and Tweuty
sixtn and Mission and Dolores streets.
A special committee consisting of A. P.
Van Duzer, Daniel Webster Kelly and
T. H. Farley was appointed to bring the
conditions of this resolution before the
School Directors at their next meeting.
George Walcom offered the followine
resolution, which, after some trivial
changes, was adopted :
Whereas, Our lives, liberty and property can
ouly be- maintained by a just and fearless judi
ciary; whereas, in the suits of Miguel Noe
against us and others, who have bought lots
and made our homes on the ban Miguel
ranch, in this ward, the defendants have been
granted a speedy trial and the plaintiffs have
been defeated by the prompt and righteous de
cisions of Judge Sanderson in favor of the de
fendant*: therefore belt
Resolved, That the Mission Defense Union
commends and indorses Judge A. A. Sander
son for his wise and just decision.
Judge Van Reynegom, chairman of the
proposed mass-meeting to be held at Tur
ner Hall on Â£ig teenth street next Satur
day evening, reported progress, and stated
that several of the nominees for munici
pal officers, but more especially the nomi
nees for ths Legislature, had promised to
be present and speak on the occasion.
He further stated that the benefits ob
tained by the Mission people were got by
reason of their unanimity of action upon
all things that tended to benefit the dis
trict.
Hrl. McQuiddjr and Her HuÂ§band.
Mrs. J. D. MrQuiddy on Tuesday applied for
a warrant in Judge Campbell's court for the
arrest of R. D. McQuiddy, her husband, a
traveling salesman with Redington & Co., on
the charge of battery. She made some charges
in which it was intimated that the couple had
been divorced and that after meeting at 412
Eddy street by bis appointment she was up
braided for obtaining a divorce, knocked
down and kicked. Tne warrant was refused
and investigation seems to j.rove that its re
quest was without reason. On the part of Mr.
MeQuiddy it appears that he did not knock his
wife down or Kick her; he did not send her a
note anking her to meet him at 412 Eddy
street uor did he upbraid her for getting a di
vorce, as she has not obtained a divorce from
him nor if there a divorce ituit even pending.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, . 1869.
FIVE THOUSAND
DOLLARS PUT UP
National Club May Get the
Corbett and Sharkey
Match.
Dan Lynch Arrives and Does
Business With Groom
and Gibbs.
TEN THOUSAND, TEN ROUNDS.
Corb.tt Was Telegraphed and Wi'.l
Answer Immediately if He
Means Bus ness.
Dan Lynch, the backer and manager of
Pugilist Tom Sharkey, arrived yesterday
afternoon from the East. Lynch had
much to say concerning sporting matters
on the other side of the mountains, but
his object in reaching this City ahead of
the fiahter was to complete some arrange
ments with his friends relative to the
opening of the racing season.
Sharkey will be here next week. He
bad a friendly sparring match last Thurs
day evening in Denver with "Reddy"
Gallagher. He will box in Cripple Creek
and a few other places before he heads for
this City.
Last evening Lynch met Groom and
Gibbs, the managers of the National
Club, and, of course, a lengthy conversa
tion resulted. Groom asked Lynch why
he refused to accept the offer thot was
made by the National Club a few weeks
ago for a ten-round content between Shar
key and Corb'tt, ana Lynch replied ttiat
he had left the arrangement of the match
in the hands of Corbett, thinking that he
would properly attend to the details
"When I met Corbett in New York, just
previous to my departure," said Lynch,
"he informed me that the proposed con
test between himself and Tom before the
National Club was off, as its managers re
fused to put up the 'douph,' and that he
was transacting business with the Eureka
Club, a new organization that had rerent
ly sprung up, mushroom-like, with life.
" "Ye*, Dan,' said Corbett, 'it ionks now
as if I myself and Sharkev will deciil? that
question of who is the better man before
the Eureka Club, as it has offered io linne
up a $12,000 purse and haÂ« deposited $6000
as a guarantee of gnoci faith in the hands
of a responsible stakeholder.'
"Well, of course, I agreed to the propo
sition, ns I am. liite any other person,
looking for the best of a came ami playing
no fflvorites. I found to my great sur
r>:i<s' > on my arrival in Chiea o that the
Eureka Club had 'funked' and had posi
tively refused to deposit a cent according
to Corbett'* instructions.
"I th^n telegraphed on to Denver and
other towns to theatrical managers that
Sharkey was disappointed in his match
with Corbett owing to a failure in the
connection of money mutters and that he
would accept engagements to box four
friendly rounds with his handler, D;mnv
Needham, or any other fighter they night
suggest. I have not heard anything sines
from Corbett, but the whole thing seems
to me very peculiar to say the least."
Af"er Groom had heard Lvnch's story
he immediately put tne question of fight
to him.
"The National Club," said Groom, ''is
ready to reopen negotiations with you,
and are you ready to do business now that
you are present?"
Lynch answered in the affirmative and
then Groom said that hp would, right
then and there, deposit ?50C0 with Andy
Lawrence of the Examiner â as Corb<?it
had selected him specially as the mnn
who must hold the stakes â just to prove
the sincerity of the National Club and that
it meant business.
"I will deposit the remaining $5000 a few
weeks prior to the contest, which, if satis
factory to you, will be decided in this
City some time in the latter part of
November.
'â¢Now, Mr. Lynch," continued thesilver
tongu d manager of the Nationals, "a!i
this club exacts of you is a deposit of
$2500 to guarantee the appearance of your
protege in the rine in good phvsical'con
dition on whatever evening we may select
for the contest, which is to be tm rounds,
arid if we Jail to bring the match off the
pugilists will be entitled to the money de
posited by us."
Lynch aereed to everything proposed
by Air. Gftom and the $5000 in coin vas
handed over to Mr. Lnwrence.
Corbett was notified by telegraph of the
result, and an anÂ»wor is expected from
him to-day. It is presumed, however, that
much quacking will result between the
fighters and club managers before the
match will be consummated, if at all.
ANOTHER LOTTERY PLAN.
Dr. J. F. Twist Prefers Charges
Against the Penny Purchas
ing Agency.
Appeals to Captain Lees for Redress
for Alleged Wrongs at the Hands
of Mrs. A. Cohen.
The attention of Captain Lees has been
called to the Penny Purchasing Agency
by Dr. J. F. Twist, who claims to be suf
iering from its operations. It is not the
first time the veteran detective has heard
similar tales, but he is at a loss to kn*ow
how he is to wipe out the agency, which,
he says, is a lottery under another name.
At the sugges ion of Captain Lees Dr.
Twist's attorney will to-morrow apply to
the courts for a warrant charging Mrs. A.
Cohen, the proprietress of the agency,
with obtaining money by false pretenses.
Mrs. Cohen's institution is much after
the same style as the so-called watch
clubs, only there is no stated amount to
be paid each week by the m> in burs.
"ThiÂ« is the way this institution is con
ducted," stated Dr. Twist to a Call re
porter yesterday afternoon. " Anybody
can join one of Mrs. A. Cohen's clubs
without paying an initiation fee. But be
fore you are a member a week her charm
ing little assistant calls on you with a
box containing 100 little envelopes. In
each envelope there is a printed number
ranging all the way from 1 to 100. You
take your pick and the particular number
that falls to your lot means that yon must
pay the box-bearer just that amount of
cents.
"This payment, whether it be 1 cent or
$1, entitles you to one chance in an alleged
drawing that takes place each we*k.
Should the nnm^ber by which you are
known at Mrs. Cohen's office be drawn
from the urn then you are entitled to re
ceive $25 worth of merchandise, an order
for which awaits the winner at the close
of each drawing.
"In the event of your being so unlucky
as to keep on paying weekly assessments
without winning the prize, you *re guar
anteed a |25 ordet for merchandise when
your weekly payments reach that amount
"That guarantee is the bait at which the
gudgeons bite. They consider that at the
very worst they will eventually get the
worth of their money in goods, and that
there is a fair possibility of winning the
prize upon the very first payment, which
cannot amount to more than one dollar,
and may possibly be but oue cent.
"Now that I have lost my money I be
gin to realize how foolish 1 waa to ever go
into the scheme.
â¢â¢Take it for granted that Mrs. Cohen's
lottery scheme is conducted upou an hon
est basis and that each club has 100 mem
bers. The average ticket in the box car
ried around to the members costs exactly
50 cents, making the value of the collec
tion $50. This amount Mrs. Cohen re
ceives in cash end the winner at that
weekly drawing gets $25 in merchandise.
Judge for yourself what profit the woman
makes. She not only draws down $25
cash as a clear profit but the percentage
allowed her as a commission on all goods
sold.
"But I contend that the profit of $325
per week she makes on the thirteen clubs
she has established is not the sum total of
her revenue. Take my csse, for instance:
"I paid in over $14 in small weeKly pay
ments, for which 1 hold receipts. When
the girl came around last week, I drew
my envelope a3 usual and found my
assessment was 74 cents. I did not have
that amount in change, to I proffered the
girl a $10 piece. She could not break the
coin and it was agreed I should send up
the right change a little later. I did so
and to my great astonishment I was noti
fied by Mrs. A. Cohen that I no longer be
longed to the club. Further, she said that
in view of the fact that my assessment
had not been paid prior to the drawing, I
had according to my signed contract, for
feited all my rights to the moneys I had
already paid in."
Following is a coDy of the contract
which each of Mrs. Cohen's 1300 patrons
have signed :
MEMBERSHIP CONTRACT.
The Penny Purchasing Agency.
Room 208, Second Floor, 927 Market Street

through their authorized Collector, the sum

Bum of Twenty-five L>ollurs, in consideration of
w hich the Agency agrees to deliver any desired
merchandise to the amount of Twenty-flve Dol
lars weekly to such member of each Club as

I further agree to abide by such selection,

understood Dyanrt between all parties hereto

FIRST HOLD-UP
OF THE SEASON
Thomas Christian, a Car
penter, Robbed by Two
Footpads.
They Present a Revolver at His
Head With ths Usual
Command.
BOTH MEN AERESTED LATER
They Are Novices at the Business and
Gave as a Reason That They
Were Hard Up.
The first hold-up of the season occurred
Friday night, the footpads being two
novices and the victim a carpenter.
Thomas Christian lives at 630 Hermann
street. He attended a meeting of the Car
penters' and Joiners' Union Friday night
and left there shortly before 10 o'clock to
go home. He was on Hermann street,
near Buchanan, when two men stepped
out of the shadow of the houses, one tall
and the other short.
Christian was unconscious of danger
and walked between them. Juct then the
taller of the two presented a revolver at
his head and said: "Throw up your
hands." Christian obeyed the command,
and while the one kept nim covered with
the revolvrr the other went through his
pockets. He had only four 50-cent pieces
and a silver watch. Christian told them
he was a hard-working man and he did
not think they were doing right in rob
bing him, but the robber with the revolver
replied that times were hard and they
needed money.
"Bay," he said to the other robber,
"give him back his ticker and slug him
ju-t once tor luck."
The watch was handed back to Chris
tian, but he was not "sluggea. " He was
then told to go a>.ead, but not to look
back, on pain o; b j ing shot, and the two
robbers walked up the hill.
Christian ran to a saloon on the corner
and asked if any one had seen the police
man en the beat. They told him he hud
passed only a few minutes before, and on
Webster street, near Haight, Christian
met PolicemaJi Fleming. He gave Fiein
ing an accurate description of the two
men, and together they went in search of
them. They found thorn standing on too
of the old reservoir hill, in the shadow of
a bi ; sign.
Fleming asked them a few questions.
They denied being t.e robbers and said
they had been at Fort J^oint and were on
their way i nine. Christian was a quiet
listener, tm. h? thought it was time to act,
and he told Fleming that they were the
men who robbed him. Fleming placed
them under arrest and took them to the
Central police station to Captain Witt
man. Fietring saw that the taller man
was careiul as to how he placed his hat on
a chair with his overcoat over it. He
made an investigation, and found the re
vo'v.r in the hat, wilti a handkerchief
rolled amuri'i it. Two fitty-cent pieces
and a nickel were found on one and two
lifty-cent pieces and a dime on the other.
They wore cocked up in the tanks, and
yesterday morning, after Christian had
another look at them they were booked
for robbery.
Tha taller gave hi 3 name as Bishop G.
Butterfield, 22 years of a/e. painter, and
tne shorLer 11. John Jones, 19 years of age,
peddler. Junes recently came from Los
Ange es, where he bad been working in
a le^taurant, and has been living with a
iUiirrird sister at 1528)^ Market street.

NO PHELAN IN THEIRS.
The United Labor Party Shy at the
Democratic .Nomine**.
The convention of the "United Labor
pany" held a brief but spirited session
again last evening in Smiley's Hall,
Valencia street. When Chairman Grace
called the convention to order sixty-three
delegates answered to their names and
four proxies were held by William Homer,
a member of the convention from the
Thirty-fourth Assembly District.
Soon after the opening of the convention
D. H. Mahoney placed in nomination
James D. Phelan for Mayor.
The convention did not take Kindly to
Mr. Phelan's nomination, many of the
delegates claiming that as Colonel Taylor
had already been indorsed the convention
could not consistently support Phelan.
Ti.e chairman called Joseph tsmiley to the
chair and taking the floor addressed the
convention at some length. He favored ttie
indorsement of Mr. Phelan and claimed
that the convention would do wdl to in
dorse the Democratio nominee. The ques
tion was put to a vote with the result of a
lie. On montion of Secretary S. M. Wil
liams tneentire matter of the indorsement
of candidates already nominated by the
other panics was referred to a committee
of five members, to be named by the
chair, the committee to submit its report
to the convention on Monday evening:.
The following: committee was named by
the chairman : S. M. Williams, D. H.
Mahoncy, Frank Haley, Joseuh Smiley
and William Homer.
1 ue committee named at the last meet
ing tc wait upon Regi-trar Hinton at the
la*t meeting reported that they would be
given twenty days prior to election in
which to file their ticket as they were al
ready recognized officially as a party.
The meeting adjourned to meet at 111
Valencia street next Tuesday evening.
BABY DUNHAM AGAIN.
Its Foster Far n a Engaged in a Suit
for Divorce
Mrs. M. T. Brewer, who recently sued
her husband for a divorce, is the foster
mother of Baby Dunham, whose father
some time ago horrified the entire country
by murdering bis wife and her whole
family.
Mr. Brewer, who is the State secretary
of the American Protective Association, is
the infant's granduncle, and after the
terrible tragedy adopted it. Now that
Mrs. Brewer has instituted suit for di
vorce, it is problematic as to where the
youngster will wind up.
ThÂ«Â» Brewers have been married for over
thirty years, and at this late date the wile
asks for divorce on the ground of failure
to provide.
Robbery Charged.
William M. Neilson was booked at the City
Prison yesterday morning on the charge of
robbery. As already published his sister-in
law, Miss Sarah McFarland, charges him with
robbing her of a Batchel containing valuable
papers about Â« week ago. He was released on
his own recognizance by Judge Conlau.

IT IS AGONIZING to think how many such "bright, happy
dreams are shattered ; how many love matches are broken off
or possible ones never realized ; how many marriages end in
separation or divorce â love turned to hate, respect to contempt
All this because of men's disgraceful weakness, which unfits
them to become the mates of pure and healthful women. .
To those who have thus fallen into the cesspool of disease ;
who are weighted down under a secret load of shame and misery ;
whose precious manly power is slipping away from them â to all
such persons Doctor Cook, the greatest of modern specialists,
extends a helping, skillful hand. His life work has been to lift
up the fallen, to restore them to sturdy manhood and to the
proper enjoyment of either married or single r life.
; While Doctor Cook's cures in cases of this character are
truly, marvelous, he also treats with unequaled success

The Whitney Residence Visited
by Burglars at an Early .
Hour.
Discovered by Miss Sarah, and Aided
by Her Brothers She Alarms
the N ighborhcoJ.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 3.â Loud cries
for help, accompanied by the shrill call of
a police whistle and the discharge of fire
arms, in the fashionable quarter of the
city aroused society people from their
beauty sleep about 4 o'clock this morning
and alaimed them considerably, as few, if
any, were able to locate the trouble. Of
ficer McCloy, at Twenty-fifth street and
Telegraph avenue, heard the noise, but
was unable to U-ll whence it came.
A Bohemian who was wending his way
home, however, was the first to gain
courage sufficient to follow the various
calls, until he located a badly frightened
youn^ man, about 17 years of age, sur
rounded by ttie feminine part of the
household, in dishabiile, on the front
doorstep ol James O. Whitney's residence,
1352 Harrison street.
On inquiry, it was found that Mr.
Whitney and wife were away from home,
and that the house had been entered by
burglars. "I had seen two suspicious
characters," said he, "about the place and
dug up my revolver to be ready in case
they came to our house. They entered by
a rear window, using a step ladder, which
they left behind in their flight."
Miss Sarah S. Whitney, a young lady
member ol the family, however, is the one
who discovered the intruders and had the
presence of mind to quietly gain her
brother's room and get him awake before
raising an alarm. "I was going to go to
the kitchen," said she, "and Bee what was
going on, and then I thought that burglars
would not hesitate to strike me down, so
1 slipped to my brother's room and
awakened him, because he bad a revolver.
He used nis lungs to good advantage
and shot at the fellows as ne saw them
leave the house."
An inve<- ignion showed that the table
and pantr> srawers nad all been over
hauled L. fore the burglars were dis
covered. Tue residence is rather off by
itself ana is surrounded by shade trees,
making it very dark. The officers go off
the beat at 4 o'clock and the men then be
lieved they had a clear field. Tne officers
are inclined to believe it is the name* gang
who entered the Chabot home a week ago
and ransacked the place, but only secured
$10 from the pockets of the young man
who had been left in charge.
MILLIONS WILL

For California Products and
in Local Undertak
ings.
The Advance in Wheat Will
Briog In Much Money
From Abroad.
BIG BUILDINGS ARE GOING UP.
Inspiriting Outlook for Mining De
velopment and Large Ship-
Building Work.
The upward tendency of wheat, which
in its rise has carried up the prices of
other cereals upon which California de
pends for a share of its prosperity, is not
the only manifestation which has caused
certain merchants to express the opinion
during the past few days that the local
situation is brightening. The condition
of the hide and leather market has im
proved materially, snort stocks encourag
ing the hardening tendency of prices.
The dried-fruit market has also taken a
forward move. Prices are better, the de
mand for supplies is better, and the East
ern dealers have expressed confidence that
the demand will continue.
The amount of money that will come in
from these sources into the State can
hardly be estimated with even approxi
mate accuracy at this time. No one can
foretell the top notch that wheat may
reach. The phenomenal news that there
is a shortage in India in the wheat crop,
which California must make good, has
awakened curiosity and piqued specula
tion in some degree.
The rise, which has been quite steady
from the inception of the upward move
ment, has taken along barley, oats, corn,
ryÂ«, hay and flour, T c quotations from
day to day have been given in The Call,
so that ttiere is little necessity for repeti
tion here. One striking fact is that there
were fifty wheat charters reported in
September of vessels arrived nere, which
is the largest numb' r for any month in
two years. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars will come in from the sources
enumerated more than could ha*re been
anticipated a few weeks ago.
The money that will be disbursed by
reason of the contracts to buila war ves
sels for the Government in the near future
by the Union Iron Works wiif, according
to Irving M. Bcott, amount to $100,000 per
month during the building period of the
two vessels, the battle-ship and the
torpedo craft. When the Oregon went
away from the yards 400 men who had
been working on that vessel were neces
sarily laid off. Tne new contracts with
the Government will put them all back.
In addition to this there is a strong proba
bility that the contract for a cruiser may
be secured by the Union Iron Works from
the Japanese Government, according to
general belief. The wages of the Union
Iron Works have amounted to about
$100,000 per month for the iast six years.
The large public buildings for which
contracts have been awarded, added to
the large structures projected by private
enterprise, will, according to good author
ity, keep up the average of ten years for
large buildings. There has been, as a
matter of common knowledge, a large
falling off in the number and total value
of smaller buildings under construction,
fcut that the average of large buildings is
Kept up points surely to the fact that the
capitalists foresee the growth of San Fran
cisco with certainty.
The largest structure going up on Mar
ket street is the huge building for The
Call, on the southwest corner of Market
and Third streets. The Hearst estate,
which owns the Nucleus builiing, on the
southeast corner of Market and Third
streets, has purchased the leases of all
tenants in the building, and after January
1, 1897, will be ready to improve the prop
erty. The expectation naturally is that
the improvements will involve the ex
penditure of a large sum in total.
Some of the other large buildings for
which contracts are let, and the most of
these buildings are under construction,
art mentioned in this connection. The
figure" are derived from George H. Wolfe,
editor of the Building News and Review.
The contracts for the ferry building call
for an expenditure of $530,000, but the
actual cost may considerably exceed that
sum.
The amount to be expended for the af
filiated colleges connected with the Uni
versity of California is limited by law to
$250,000. The contracts so nearly equal
this sum that the compensation of the
architects has been otherwise provided
for. The sum of $300,000 has been appro
priated for the new municipal building at
Washington and Kearny streets. Archi
tects say that it will cost much more than
that sum.
These three public works represent over
$1,000,000 to be expended. The full
measure of benefit will not ba derived by
San Francisco that would be the case if so
much material were not brought from
abroad, especially iron work and terra
cotta.
The following buildings of large cost are
to be considered at this time as indicative:
The Clark estate building on Market and
Bush will cost $100,000. The Spring Val
ley Water Works building, to stand at
Geary and Stockton, is estimated to cost
$250,000, the iron alone costing $60,000.
The Hobart building on Post street, below
Stockton, will cost about $70,000. Then
there are these buildings: Royal Eagle
Distillery building, at Ellis and Mason,
$70,000; the Gas Company building, on
Post, above Powell, about $70,000: the Mc-
Carthy building, on Market street, near
Spear, $70,000.
The Valley Railroad will earn many
thousands of dollars for the farmers of the
San Joaquin Valley, from now on, in the
movement of their crops, in the lower
transportation ratÂ«s which have been es
tablished by it, and intelligent observers
believe that this road will be a prime
factor in aiding the rr.pid development of
the State and of San Francisco.
There is a rumor that the great Mari
posa grant is about to be sold. That it
has bean sold is denied by Mr. Cross, the
president of the company owning it. But
there is a great amount of capital liable
to go into the development of California
mining properties in the near future. Ex
perts from Europe have been out on the
mother lode in force. Should the rumor
prove true that a foreign syndicate is
about to acquire the Mariposa grant that
would necessarily imply activity on a
large scale and the putting in of great
sums in devolopment.
Colonel W. B. Sumneiof W. B. Bumner
& Co, spoke yesterday of the improved
situation of hnies and leather. Dry hides,
since the Maine and Vermont elections,
have made a sharp advanc of 1 cent per
ponnd. California oak leather has ad
vanced from % to 1 cent per pound and
the business outlook is much better in
New York and Boston and Kansas City.
The outlook is much better than at any
time since last July. This is due to the
promise of stability in the National finan
cial policy held out by the political indi
cations in Maine and Vermont.
Concerning the improvement in the
market for California dried fruits, Colonel
A. E. Castle and Maurice Loewenstein of
Castle Bros, say that confidence in the
East has improved both the prices and the
demand. Before the Maine and Vermont
elections there was no demand. Now all
the Eastern houses are doing some busi
ness in tue California goods.
These are some of the facts which con
tain reasons for local business cheerful-
ness.

Second Brigade Officers
Discuss the Matter at
a Meeting.
They Organize a New Associa
tion and Appoint a Legis
tive Committee.
GEN. # WAEFIELD PRESIDENT.
The Session Was Executiveâ Large
Attendance of Officers From
City and Country.
A meeting of commissioned officers of
the Second Brigade of the National Guard
of California was held at the California
Hotel last evening. The meeting was
called by General R. H. Warbeld, at the
suggestion of Colonel William Macdonald
and Colonel D. B. Fairbanks. These offi
cers were present, toe-ether with Lieuten
ant-Colonel Joseph Giesting, Lieutenant-
Colonel Hansen and Captain Napthaly of
the brigade staff ; Lieutenant-Colonel Du
boce, Majors Tilden, Boxton and Sime,
Capiatn Kelleber, Adjutant and Lieuten
ant Hogan, First Infantry, and Liea
tenant-Colonel A. K. Whitton, San Jose,
Major Hays, Oakland; Major Jullia/d,
Santa Rosa; Captain Elliott, San Rafael;
Captain Haven and Lieutenants Holmes
and Bean, Santa Rosa; Captain D. A.
Smith, adjutant Fifth Infantry; Captain
Boardman, Second Brigade Signal Corps;
Captain Jenks, cavalry troop; Captain
Filmer, and others.
The meeting was called to order by Gen
eral Warfiela. Colonel Giesting was
chosen temporary secretary. A committee
on organization, consisting of Colonel
Duboce, Colonel Whitton and Captain
Boardman, was appointed.
Major Hays, Major Murphy, Captains
Butliffe and Jenks and Lieutenant E. S.
Heller were named a? a committee on by
laws.
It was decided to name the organiza
tion "Officers' Association of the Second
Brigade, N. G. 0."
A legislative committee, consisting of
Colonel Duboce, Major Tilden, Captain
O'Neill, Captain Filmer and Captain
Smith trom the City was appointed. The
following consulting officers were added
to the committee: Colonel Fairbanks,
Petaluma; Major Julliard, Santa Rosa;
Colonel Whitron, San Jose; Major Hays,
Oakland: Captain Elliott, San Rafael, and
Captain Bush. Napa.
The committee appointed to recommend
officers of the as-ociation consisted of
Major Tilden, Major Julliard, Major Mur
phy, Captain Elliott and Lieutenant Har
low. After a recess ol fifteen minutes the
committee reported, recommending the
following officer : President. General R.
H. Warfield; first vice-president, Colonel
William Macdonald; second vice-presi
eent, Colonel D. B. Fairbanks; treasurer,
Major Boxton; secretary, Captain Nap
thaly.
The report was adopted and Captain
Smiih cast the ballot of election.
The meeting was executive and lasted
f<v nearly two hours. Many of the of
ficers present belong to the old National
Guard Officers' Association, of which
General Dickinson, retired, is president,
and Colonel H. P. Bush, retired, treas
urer. There ha? not been a meeting of
this organization since the cruar i was re
organized a year ago. The point was
raised that there was a sum of $600 or so
in the treasury when the last meeting was
held, and some of the officers desired to
know if the money was now available for
the new organization.
Quite a discussion ensued on this point,
some of the officers being confident that
there was a considerable sum of money on
hand at last accounts. It was decided by
common consent that General Dickinson,
president of the old association, should
call a meeting of that body, at which an
accounting should be rendered. Some
doubt existed as to the exact amount of
money on hand when the association last
met. hence it was deemed advisable that
an official report of the treasurer should
be submitted.
Col. Peeler, assistant adjutant-general, is
in the City, but did not attend the meet
ing last night.
The next meeting of the new association
will be held one week from next Tuesday
evening.
PORTUGUESE UNION.
Annual Convention to Be Held Next
Week in Pleasanton.
PLEABANTON, Cal., Oct. 3.â The Por
tuguese Union meets at Druids' Hall next
Tuesday at 10 a. m. The hall is tastefully
decorated for the occasion. On Tuesday
evening there will be a ball at Rose Hall
and Wednesday evening a banquet at
Rose Hotel. The citizens will provide car
riages for the delegates to enjoy a trip in
the country during their stay. There will
be much friendly rivalry for the grand
offices.
Frank Lemos, the present grand vice, is
in order lor promotion, but it is quietly
hinted that a prominent delegate from
Oakland will contest for the honor. For
grand marshal Joseph Bernardo of Hay
wards sterns to be at present the lucky
man. There will also be a contest for
almost every office in the gift of the order
and also for the next meeting- place of the
union.
It is hinted that San Leandro. the birth
place of the organization, will endeavor to
secure the honor of entertaining the dele
gates at the next session, but they will
have plenty of rivalry from other citie?.
The reports of grand officers will be inter
esting. During the past month two new
branches have been organized, one at
Fresno and the other at Hanford. The
order will show a large increase in mem
bership and will also be found on a solid
financial basis.

Night.
He Recently Wrote to His Sister
That He 1 hought of

/WAS A KELLY AGITATOB.
An Intimate Friend Thinks the Miss
â¢ ing Man Is Atoning ior Having
Renounced Religion.
. Oakland Office Sab Fkakcisco Call,[
9uÃ Broadway, Oct. 3. (
â¢ Samuel Speckman mysteriously dis
appeared from his home during Thursday
nipht, and it is supposed that he has re
tired into tbe liilis to fast and pray.
The missing man is very weil known In
this city, where he has been at different
-' tinifs an active Salvationist! a labor
orator, :md during the Kelly excitement
Bpeckman was one of the most frequent
speakers to the Industrial Army at the
'foot of Broadway, and was ma ;e lieu
tenant under General Kelly. During all this
time Speckman has been a hard-working
man, and although he took part in many
erratic movements he always- took work
when he could get it.
. nature ig very intense, and
although for about three years he has
â  been a professed atheist, he has of late
ehown a disposition to return to his
former faith and has frequently had
â  moroid spehs.
â¢ -.The Speckman family reside at 724 Per
-alta street, and during last Thursday:
â¢night the husband and father got up after
retiring and left without bidding his wife
.adieu. It was only when awakened by a
child : crying that she discovered her hus
ban 1 was missing.
Speckman has been employed out at
"the Oakland Trotting Park, and sometime
ago a piece of timber fell upon his head.
Since that time he has complained a jaeat
. deal of pains in his head and at times has
â¢ been delirious. It is feared by his rela
tives that while suffering from an attack
of this kind he wandered off and jumped
in the bay. It has just been learned that
about a month ago he wrote a letter to his
â  sister in. England, in which he spoke of
his suffering and stated that if it were not
for his wile and babies he would feel lito
ending his existence. The wife of the
mi. -sing man has visited all the hospitals
and prisons in this neighborhood, but has
â¢ been abie to learn nothing.
"I do not believe Speckman has jumped
into the bay," eaid one of Speckuiau's
â¢ intimate friends to-day. "He is a very
peculiar fellow anil, once he used to be
â very religious. Of .late his . mind has
wa.n:iersd back to iel is. on, and he was
.feeling very | bad because be has been â  a
professed infidel for several years. He
seemed to have the idea that if he retired
into solitude lor a time so that he cculd
fast and pray, he could in some way
atone for his actions and sayings. I am
more inclined to believe that he has gone
qSL to the liills or to some place where he
can be alone than that he has ended bis
: life."
The missing man is 5 feet 7 inches in
height, is of dark complexion, with heavy
dark mustache. He was dressed in a gray
cutaway coat and light trousers and wore
a light cap. He is an intelligent earnest
speaker and well educaÂ»ed.
DECORATING HAS BEGUN.
Bridesmaids Are Named for the
Lcns-Requa Military Wed
ding Next Month.
A Large Tent Is on the Lawa to Ac
cemmodate Three Hundred
and Fifty Guests.
Oakla>d Office Pan Fkaxcisco Call,)
008 Broadway, Oct. 3. j
The event of the year in social circles is
the military wedding of Miss Amy Requa
and Colonel Long, which will be solemn
ized next Tuesday at St. Paul's Episcopal
Church. At the Requa seat. Highlands,
great preparations are being made for the
event.
No one at present in society remembers
when there was a very swell military wed
ding in this city, aud the interest is very
great. The decorations at the beautiful
home are being personally superintended
by Mrs, Requa, and the designs are very
patriotic and extremely artistic and grace
ful.
The big tent, in which the 350 guests will
partake of the wedding breakfast, is al
ready up on the lawn. Ivy and vari
colored flags, with great branches of trees
thrown across the top.are very pretty, and
suggest the idea of a banquet in a decor
ated forest. Carriages will meet the guests
at Piedmont, and carry them over to
Highlands.
Miss Amy Requa is one of the most
beautiful brides of the year and has a
very pretty wedding gown of white silk
with dainty Valencienues trimmings.
The bri iefcmaids are to be Lucy King,
Miss Requa's favorite cousin; Ida Belie
Palmer, Sliss Jessie Glascock, Miss Ham
ilton of Santa Monica and Miss Morgan.
They will be attired in beautiful pink
gowns with exquisite pink felt hrtts
trimmed in pink ostrich feathers and
pink velvet roses. It is not yet known
who is to be "best man," as the one orig
inally chosen by Colonel Long is ill and
cannot come from Washington.
One little fact should not be lost sight
of. The weuding gown did not come
from Paiis, but is an Oakland creation,
and so is nearly all of the bride's gener
ous trousseau. Miss Requa is an earnest
advocate of home industry.

RIVAL CLUBS TO COMBINE
Harmony Restored Between
Berkeley Political Organi
zations.
The McKinley League and the Repub
lican Club May Consolidate
oa Koaday Night
BERKELEY, Cal.. Oct. 3.â The two
Republican clubs of Berkeley which have
been contesting with one anotner over pri
maries and other matters are discussing
the matter of consolidation, and it is
probable that next Monday nignt will see
them united into one organization.
Tha two clubs â the Republican Club,
whose president is William Lair Hill, and
the McKinley League, presided over by
Joseph McLain â were botn formed at the
beginning of the present campaign. The
members of the McKinley League claimed
that their organization was ihe "regular"
one, formed under tbe auspices of the
county committee, and a good deal of bit
terness was engendered by the contest for
supremacy between the two duds.
The league and the club were opposed
to one another at the recent primary elec
tions, and a lively split in the party, lo
cally, was predicted as a result of these
tights, but now that the primaries are
over a spirit of reconciliation exists, and
efforts are being made to aliiiiate the two
clubs.
The Republican Club will meet on Mon
day nignt in Odd Fellows' Hall, and it is
expected that an invitation will be ex
tended to tue other organization to con
solidate and make one club.
Pres-iiieat McClain of the McKinley
League will attend the Republican Club
meeting, and will probably Lave some
thing to say on the matter of affiliation,
"i Lave not hear i of any definite proposal
for consolidation," said Mr. McClain to
day, "but there has been a good deal of in
formal talk ou the subject.
"It Is generally agreed that there are too
many ciubs in the town. Both the Mc-
Kinley League and the Republican Club
are now v/orking for the tame end â the
success of the Republican nomineesâ and
there is certainly no reasuu why they
should not work together."
The two clnbs are about equal in
strength. ThÂ»- Republican Club acnieved
a viciory at the first primary election,
when it stood for Hilborn for Congress,
and the McKinley Leacue was victorious
in the last contest, in which it supported
Strattoa for State Senator.
Will Not Disband.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 3.â The Colum
bia Fire Company has decided not to dis
uand, and East Berkeley will not be left
without protection in case of conflagra
tion. . Tbe company has been considerably
divided since the discussion over tne elec
tion of a Fire Chief, and its disorganiza

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
AN OBJECT LESSON FOR LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 3.â The overcrowded condition of the buildings and classrooms at the State University has neces
sitated the erection of tents for the accommodation of the overflow. When these new canvas houses shall have been put into
position bere and there on the campus, a scene will be presented similar to that afforded by a typical modern campmeeting, with
its main structure and its tented city round about. Though nearly every classroom in the university is crowded beyond all pro
portion, each professor seems to hope that the other will be chosen to move into the tents with his party of co-eds.
For the present only three will be erected. The largest will measure 40x80 feet and have a capacity of from 600 to 800 persons.
The second in size will be in dimensions 30x60 feet and will seat about 350. The third is Bomewhat smaller. It is to be 30x60 feet
in area and will have a seating capacity of nearly 200. Every tent is to have a heavy canvas fly cover and a raised board floor.
There will be a vestibule in each for hats and coats, and all three tents will nave stoves in them.
The use of tents for classrooms seems to be wholly unprecedented in the history of modern universities; and the recent
saying of President Kellogg, that "Berkeley's prosperity is her misfortune," appears to have been timely and well placed.
Every effort is now being made to secure pledges from Legislative candidates to work for a State appropriation of $250,000 for
necessary permanent buildings.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 3.â The track of
tbe Aletneda Driving Association was

The judges of the events were C. S.
Neal, Valentine Hush and R. B. Bain, the

little late in reaching tbe grand stand
Maybrey McMahan timed the first race
with the others. D.M.Martin, mounted
on a gray horse, made an efficient marshal
and was a terror to the small boy who in
sisted on getting on tne track. C. C.
Gardner, secretary of the association, kept
the records and weighed the riders.
Tbe track was lined on each side for a
half mi!e with buggies of all descriptions,
while the grand stand held all that it
would seat, besides hundreds stood up to
view the taces.
The first event was a special race, with
A. H. Cohen's Promise Me and Grant Lap
bam's Addison at the post. Tney made a
preity start after scoring once, and made
good time until tbe three-quarter post
was reached, where they both seemed to
lose their wind. Cohen plied the whip
freelj and came in bti easy winner.
Time, 2:U% This was tbe first record on
tbe new track. President Eil>wcrin and
others hoped for a better one, but were
disappointed. In the second heat Prom
ise Me won in 2:17^.
The 2:40 trot brought out H. P. Witch

Lassie B and H. L. Transue's Silver But
ton. The former carried forty-five pounds
and the latier forty pounds" over-weight.
Silver Button and Wild Penny trotted a
dead heat in 2:39}^, with Lassie B second.
The last quarter was made in :37%. In
the second heat they came in Silver But
ton, Wild Penny and Lassie B. Time,
2:39%. This heat was delayed by Bennett
leaving the course. He was fined $1 by
the judges, which he paid amid mucn
laughter. In the third heat Wild Penny
crossed the line in 2:34%, with Silver But
ton a close second, Las->ie B being beat.
Bennett withdrew before the final heat,
claiming that his horse was distressed arvd
had been for a week past. The last heat
and race was won by Silver Button easily
in 2:36^.
In the 2:35 pace the entries were Wil
liam Higby'b Dan, Thomas Moran's Count
and Grant Lnpbam's Swifty. The first
beat went to Swifty in 2:30W, Count sec
ond, Dan third. The second h^at and the

CAN SEE THROUGH
THE TELEPHONE
Claim .of a Wealthy Inven
tor of the Encinal
City.
Disguising the Voice Will No
Longer Avail as a Means
of Deceit.
CLEEK LAMBOKN CONFIDEKT
Several People Have Tested the Ex
periment and Declare It Is .
a Success.
Oakland Office Sax FkanciscoCall,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 3. i
City Clerk Lam born of Alameda has
been made the custodian of a scientific
secret that will startle the whole speaking
world. A wealthy resident of the Encinal
City who has bpen conducting h.'s experi
ments in secret for several moaths claims
to have discovered a method by which one
person, when speaking at a telephone, can
see the person to whom he or she may be
peaking. The new invention, when it
becomes common, will certainly be a ereat
moral agent, as it will make it impossible
to continue the present practice of dis
guising the voice to create the impression
that some one other than the speaker ia
carrying on the conversation.
Mr. Lambron is under a piedee not to
divulge the name of the inventor, but
vouches for the accuracy of the elec
trician's claim. "He is an elderly man,"
said the City Clerk, "ana is possessed of
wealth and is well known. Everybody
knows him and that is the reason i by he
wishes to remain incog, till his scheme is
perfected.
"The machine has been tried in Ala
meda ana has worked perfectly. Wuile
carrying on a conversation with some one
over a telephone the inventor has seen
quite plainly the face of the person to
whom he was talking. There is still some
doubt as to the efficasy of the machine
over long distances. A few days ago we
applied to the Sunset Telephone Company
to lease us an exclusive wire from San
Francisco during the hours of 1 to 4 in
the afternoon. We were willing to pay a
reasonable sum for the privilege, but the
price asKed was so high that we decided to
try some more economical method.
"The inventor has worked for a long
time on this patent, and has p pent con
siderable money on it. It consists of an
attachment to the telephone that reflects
the face of the speakers, and more I am
not at liberty to say."
Wnen app ication was made to the tele
phone company for an exclusive wire, the
managers stated that tha wires coaid be
obtained at a cheaper rate during the
night, but this did not feuit the unknown
electrician. He is anxious to work in the
daytime.
Considerable incredulity has been ex
pressed regarding the success of the
scheme to make "the telephone carry the
impressions of facrs, but Mr. Lamborn is
confident and declares that several pÂ«ople
in Alameda have witnessed its success at
short distances, and that when a long
distance wire has been obtained the ex
periments will be completed and tho se
cret given to the world, together with the
name of the inventor.
NO FREE SILVER PAPER,
Frank Confession of Two Editors
Who Misread the Sign 3
of the Times.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,?
â â â nÂ» -o ' 908 Broadway, Oct. 3. ' )
Just tWo weeks ? ago two bright young
men, misled :by :* the utterances of a few.
conceived the idea that Oakland would be
a veritable mint for any one who had the
courage to issue a "silver" paper. Special
efforts were made to make a good showing
with the first number, and the result was
a very attractive and creditable newspaper.
,' The projectors, Messrs Wasson & Ed
mundson, 1 ' spent considerable time -in
evolving* a name for the newspaper, and
after much thought decided to call their
journal "16 to 1." The name has been
conceded bvjthe editors to be peculiarly ap
propriate, but not in the generally ac
cepted sense of those figures. It was
found that the desire for such politics as
"16 'to 1" advocate! was about 16 to 1
against its policy. , BsSSP^
/The ; solicitors. soon discovered that "16
to 1" was a very ; frosty proposition to
place before intellectual . Oklanders, and
No. 1, vol. I was both its Alpha and
Omega.
The silver paper was merged in one
short week riu to an independent journal
and its name changed to the Mail. In the
current issue of the Mail the editors
frankly admit their mistake and their ex
planation needs no explaining. It is as
follows: . ,
The proprietors of the Mail have been asked
why their other paper, Sixteen to â¢ One, sus
pended publication. In answer we shall state
the truth that the free silver element refused
to aid it and we could not run the paper on
wind, c* Some ; persona have been fortunate
enough to be doing such a thing at present,
even in - Oakland, - but 'we " have a , different
policy and shall carry it out or go to the wall.
We did not ask or receive donations. -We is
sued the paper on our own responsibility and
incurred no ; liabilities. ; Our : mistake ' was in
believing that a good many more people
wanted the sort or paper we issued than we
found to be ; the I case, therefore we promptly
closed the incident.'- ' ' _ â â¢â ' â â â¢â ''.

TOM REED WILL
GREET US SOON
The Magnetic Man From
Maine to Speak in
California.
He Will Arrive in Two Weeks
and Will Make Things
Hum.
TRIO OF EMINENT ORATORS.
What the Republican State Central
Committee Has Done During
Eight Weeks.
For several days psst Chairman Me-
Langhlin and Secretary Higpins. of the
Republican State Central Committee,
have been in telegraphic communication
â¢with Thomas B. Reed of Maine with the
view of Having him visit California and
deliver a few speeches here during the
campaign.
Yesterday the negotiations were com
pleted and Mr. Reed wired a message to
Chairman McLaujzhlin to the effect that
Mr. Reed would arrive in California on
the 19th of this month and would deliver
five or six speeches in various parts ot this
State.
This is pood news for Republicans here.
Mr. Reed is one of the most popular Re
publicans in the United Slates, and his
magnetism never fails to sway the hearts
and minds of those who hear him.
In addition to the magnetic statesman
from Maine the State Central Committee
has secured the services of Benjamin But
terworth and F. K. Schoonmaker, who
will addmss the citizens of San Francisco
in the Woodward's Garden Pavilion on
Saturday evening of this week.
Mr. Butterworth was formerly a mem
ber of Congress from Cincinnati, Ohio.
He served several terms in thp House of
Representatives and is now known as one
of the most eminent attorneys in the
United States. For several years he has
been engaged in practicing law in Wash
ington, 1). C.
Mr. Schoonmaker is a prominent busi
ness man of New Jersey and is reputed
to be one of the most polished orators in
the country.
The committee has made up the follow
ing itinerary for those gentlemen:
Mr. Schoonmaker â October 5. JPalo Alto;
October 6, Sacramento; October 7, Stock
ton; October 8. Oakland; October 9, San
Jose; October 10, San Francisco; October
12, Bakersfieid; October 13, luiare; Octo
ber 14, Modesto; October 15. Napa; Octo
ber 16, Marysville; October 17, Red Bluff.
Mr. Butterworth â October 5, San Ber
nardino; October 6, San Diego; October 7,
Santa Ana (aiternoon), Los Angeles (even
ing); October 8, Ventura; October 9,
Fresno; October 10, Palo Alto (afternoon),
San Francisco (evening).
Tue Republican State Central Commit
tee has done splendid work in this cam
paign.
"When we started in," said Major Mc-
Laughlin to a friend yesterday, "we found
in answer to our inquiries throughout the
State that there was considerable apathy
among Republicans in the matter of regis
tration. This was a very important mat
ter, for without registration th re are no
votes. The cause of this was the silver
wave that swept over the State when the
Chicago piatform was adopted and Bryan
â¢was nominated. We found that many Re
publicans had made up their mind not to
vote at all this year.
"They had Deen affected by the silver
craze and we felt that the matter was
very serious. To have called attention to
it with a blare of trumpets would have
had the effect of waking up ihe enemy.
We toot the necessary steps to convince
those Republicans of the error of their
ways, and by acting judiciously we have
succeeded in a larger registration than
ever recorded before.
"As an illustration of the extent to
which the- silver craze had hypnotized the
people I will mention the fact that several
connties, in response to our inquiries,
asked us not to send any literature or
speakers to tnem. They were absolutely
in a state of panic ; and now those coun
ties are the most prominently Republican
in the State.
"Take the county of Mariposa, for in
stance. This is the first time in eighteen
years that the county has been repre
sented by a Republican County Commit
tee, and it is absolutely certain that it will
give a Republican majority. The great
est obstacle, the financial question, was
thoroaghly gone into by the men who can
vassed that county for us.
"Our most difficult task was at the start,
in getting the counties into shape for
effective work, with what success is best
told by Republicans from the interior who
visit our headquarters, and who tell us that
better work was never carried out by
any former committee. This marvelous
change in the situation during the last
eight weeks is due absolutely to the work
of this committee and its sub-committees
throughout the State, and to the enormous
mass of literature distributed throughout
the State from the National Committee,
amounting to over 1,400.000 documents,
leaflets on twenty different subjects and
in four different languages.
"Take the matter of badges alone.
Although they may seem a trifle, we have
found them of the utmost value, for when
once a man pins one of those badges to his
coat lapel he seems to imbibe a
certain esprit de corps, and is eager
and enthusiastic in the cause. We have
already sent out 140,000 of those badges,
and during the next week we expect to
distribute 15,000 more. We have put out
over 10,000 postera, which were designed
from top to bottom by ourselves, and
which are of such a striking character
that we have received requests for them
from all over the United States. The Re
publican State Central Committee of lowa
has ordered 100,000 of them. In addition
to those we distributed 40,000 other litho
graphs.
"Throughout the State we have to-day
about 450 clubs in active existence. In
1894, with a full State ticket in the field,
including the speeches made by the can
didates, there were delivered up to the
corresponding date outside of the (Jily and
County of San Francisco 194 speeches. Up
to date this year we have had delivered by
the best speakers obtainable 398 speeches,
not counting about 100 made in San Fran
cisco. We have now arranged for the
services of some of the most prominent
speakers, including Thomas B. Reed of
Maine, Benjamin Butterworth of Ohio and
F. X- Shoonmaker of New Jersey.
â¢'We are now making a most careful and
systematic poll of the State, and from
what I have learned of it thus far, I am
as confident that this State will cast its
nine electoral votes for McKinley and
prosperity, as I am that the destinies of
this great Nation are being watched over
by the Almighty.
"In the management of former cam
paigns there was considerably secrecy and
close-room business. It is not so with the
present committee. Our rooms are always
open from 8 o'clock in the morning until
11 o'clock at night. There are no star
chamber proceedings there: everything is
open and the chairman can be as easily
reached as the humblest employe con
nected with the place.
'â¢A look into oar mailing department
will show the magnitude ol the work.
We have three rooms in the entresol of
the Palace Hot^l piled up witD bundles of
literature, lithographs, etc., in the t>rocess
of being mailed. We have fully 3000 per
sons who distribute documents in tne dif
lerent precincts throughout the State not
officially connected with any committee,
and we have 35,000 additional names on
our books to whom we send single docu
ments as soon as they are received."
Neither Major McLaughlin nor Colonel
Higgins receives any remuneration or sal
ary, directly or indirectly. They have
put in about sixteen hours every day in
this volunteered work for the party.
Major McLaughlin has been obliged to
neglect his large mining interests in Butte
County, and is out of poctet between
$9000 and $10,000.
George K. Fitch and I. T. Milliken, the
chairman Â»nd secretary of tne Citizens'
Non-Partisan Convention, appeared be ore
Rpgistrar Hinton yesterduy afternoon and
offered the ticket of that convention to be
placed upon the official ballot. Mr. Hin
ton informed the gentlemen that he would
file the municipal and judicial tickets, but
that as a protest had been received by him
with reierence to the legislative ticket he
would take that matter under aavise
rnent.
The protest begins with the following
words:
Understanding from the daily papers that a
body of electors styling themselves as a Non-
Partisan convention are about to file a certifi
cate of nomination for members of the State
Senate and Assembly in various Senatorial
and Assembly districts in this City, which
candidates have been nominated by such Non-
Partisan convention, we desire to enter our
protest in behalf of the Republican County
Committee against the receiving and
filing of any such certificate or
certificates by you on the ground
and for the reason that such nominations lor
the Senate and Assembly were not made by a
convention of delegates representing a politi
cal party in the respective legislative districts
which at the last election polled at i<>ast 3 per
cent oi the entire vote of the respective Sena
torial or Assembly districts in which such
nominations were made.
We further represent to you that at the gen
eral election held two years ago the Non-Par
tisan convention did not make any nomina
tions for the Legislature in the Senatorial and
Assembly districts.
The Drotestants refer the Registrar to
section 1186 of the election law, which de
fines a valid convention as one represent
ing a political party which at the last elec
tion before the holding of such convention
polled at least 3 per cent of the entire vote
of the State, county, district or other po
litical division in which the nomination is
made.
Loyalty at Ocean View.
The greatest Republican rally of the
Ocean View campaign was held in
Murphy's Hall last Friday night. It was
under the auspices of the McKinley and
Hobart Republican Club, and the Thirty
fifth District Drill Corps and band at
tended to the number of eighty-five mem
bers. Charles Maisel called the meeting
to order and introduced SupervisorHobbs,
who presided throughout the evening.
Candidate Carroll Cook, O. K. McMurray,
Colonel C. L. Taylor, C. M. Depue, N. A.
Richardson, Dr. O'Byrnes and J. K. C.
Hobbs made eloquent addresses. Letters
of regret for non-attendance were read
from George W. Elder and W. A. Deane.
The Ingleside Glee Club rendered some
telling selection?, and so enthusiastic was
the gathering that many Democrats after
ward signed the roil.
C. S- Laumelster Nominated.
The Supreme Court has fixed next Tues
day morning at 10 o'clock as the time for
hearing the evidence on the writ of man
date applied for by D. L. Farnsworth to
com Del the Registrar to place the Kelly-
Mahoney nominations on the official
ballot.
The Kelly-Mahoney committee met yes
terday and nominated C. S. Lanmeister
for Mayor in place of Henry P. Sonntae,
withdrawn.

Non- Partisans.

Mayor Ellen for the purpose of filling va
cancies on the ticket. It was decided not
to make any nominations for the Assem
bly from the Thirty-sixth and Forty-third
districts.
George K. Fitch was appointed chair
man of the County Committee, and I. T.
Milliken secretary.
The Major Must Rest.
Major McLaughlin, chairman of the
State Central Committee, who has been
working sixteen hours a day for the past
eight weeks, left yesterday afternoon for a
visit to his family in Santa Cruz. He will
return to-morrow.
The ** Examiner's n Ideal Public Servants, Whom It Now Opposes.
It is interesting for the student of local politics to note the changes that come betimes over the capricious spirit of "The
San Francisco Examiner's" dreams.
The accompanying pictures of Colonel Charles L. Taylor and Supervisor Dimond, with nattering comment, appeared when
those officials did commendable things.
Accompanying the reproduced picture of Colonel Taylor, under date of July 24, 1896, "The Examiner" said:
Supervisor Taylor ia the man who opposed the reductions. At a meeting of the Board of Supervisors? sitting aa a
Connty Board of .Equalization, < . L.. Taylor was the only man that voted against the reduction of the assessments of the
corporations His vote waÂ« vnluable, in that It showed that at least one of the Supervisors that were present COtTL>D
NOT BE COXTROLLiI) IV THG KXiiJIIKS OF TIU. CITY. Mr. Taylor approves the calling of the mass-meeting of the
Civic Federation to protest against the action of the "Solid Seven," and hopes that the efforts of the Grand Jury to
punish the unfaithful servants may be successful.
Of Supervisor Dimond and his ordinance against the Vining transfer system the same paper said June 9:
Supervisor Dimond, who Introduced the order, and all the other members will receive the thanks of the citizens for
suppressing the nuisance that has proved so burdensome, that has given occasion for so many outrages on the persons of
passengers, and that has threatened on so many occasions to result In riot and the serious injury or death of the com
pany's Innocent employes.
Like the idle winds, however, the "great" organ of "pure" Democracy now whines as follows in its edition of yesterday:
"The odorous set of bosses that controlled the Kelly-Mahoney Convention, together, with the equally odorous set that
controlled the Curry-Crimmins-Shortridge gathering, look to Mr. Taylor to provide their herds of taxeaters with, pasturage at
the public expense. They advocate his election, not because they think he would give San Francisco an honest and business
like administration, out because he is a 'Republican.' "
It might interest a great many lovers of justice to know how it is that, if Captain Taylor was an honest citizen and ideal
official a few months ago, he can have degenerated so frightfully in so brief a time. Truly, the ways of the journal of Rainey
are past finding out.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
DIVISION AMONG
NON-PARTISANS
Nomination of a Legislative
Ticket Causes
Trouble.
The Party Said to Have Ruined
Its Influence by Mixing
Politics.
STEVE WHITE'S FRIENDS "WIN.
Members Declare They Were Opposed
to the Action Pointed Against
Protection.
And now there is all sorts of fouble
brewing in the ranks of the Non-Partisans.
It begins to appear to many that the late
convention was worked in the interest of
Stephen M. White for United States Sena
tor.
At all eventi the action of the conven
tion in putting up nominees for the Legis
lature is recognized as a complete anl un
warranted departure from the original
purposes of the Non-Partisan party. The
Non-Partisan party was organized to se
cure to San Francisco a business adminis
trationâto lift the municipal government
out of party politics.
Republicans and Democrats joined in
the movement in the confidence that th<-y
would not be expected to renounce their
allegiance to their respective parties in
State or National campaigns.
The ticket put up by the recent Non-
Partisan Convention, however, calls upon
those who vote it to support men for '-he
State Legislature, whose most important
duty will be to elect a United States Sen
ator.
This fact is provoking the loudest kind
of a roar in the Non-Partisan ranks and
bids rair to entirely disrupt, if not to dis
integrate, the Non-Partisan following.
Certain it is that the municipal vote will
be greatly weakened by the presence upon
it of the legislative candidates.
Thomas Pollard, senior member of the
firm of Pol'ard & Dodge, lumber mer
chants and shipping agents, declared that
he was strongly opposed to the Non-Par
tisan party taking a hand in politics,
either State or National, and he wisely
maintained that such unprecedented
action might have the disastrous effect of
injuring the country's chances for protec
tion and McKinley.
"There undoubtedly was a strong feel
ing in tha convention last night
against such acton," he said. "That is,
the sentiment was that tne Non-Partisan
party should not so into politics outside
of municipal affairs. The feeling was
quite pronounced on this proposition and
the majority was against enter. ne the
political arena, although a certain num
ber wanted the Non-Partisan party to co
into politics. lam positively opposed to
it.
"The main issue of the Non-Partisan
party is to confine itself strictly to local
affairs for the sake of Rood municipal gov
ernment and a better order of things in
San Francisco, and I do not believe in go
ing beyond that, because we are composed
of Republicans and Democrats and it
wou-d uot be wise to introduce party in
fluences.
"In National affairs we members of the
Non-Partisan party are divided.
"For my part 1 am a strong Republican
and stand for the principles of my party.
So, for that reason, I am" opposed to put
ting men into Sacramento who will elect
a Democratic Senator. I believe in Mc-
Kinley and protection and consequently
would send to Sacramento only the man
who would support them."
George Cummings, the manufacturing
machinist and a director of the Me janics'
Institute, is another prominent member
of the Non-Partisan convention who has
risen up to protest against the machina
tions which led the Non-Pariisan conven
tion into National politics. He did not
even speak for himself last evening, but
for the whole committee on municipal af
fairs, which to a man was against the
party killing itseif by going beyond the
bounds of its original aims and purposes.
Here is what Mr. Cummings said.wiMi a
good deal of firmness and apparent feel
ing:
"I know that almost all the committee
on municipal nominations, of which I was
a member, was d ad opposed 10 interfering
in any manner with candidates tor the
Legislature. Thisquesiion was canvassed
in the committee, and I could not 11 .id one
who was not opposed to it.
"I know there waa a bitter feeling
apamst the Non-Partisan party goin^ into
National politics and bad I been at the
convention last night I certainly would
have ttron ly opposed it, but I had to be
at tbe Mechanics' Fair to receive Governor
Budd.
"The opinion cf the committee was that
nominating a legislative ticket would
weafcen our municipal ticket and be de
cidedly detrimental to our influence, act
ing as non-parlisans for good City govern
ment. The committee further believed
that the party was organized for munici
pal affairs only.
"But in this thing of taking up a legis
lative ticket the Non-Partisans' action
took on a different political color, from
the fact that the parties we were trying to
elect would have to elect United States
Senators.
"Our committee that opposed the action
was composed of Fred Zeile, Henry L.
Davis, L. A. Berteling, E. J. Le Breton, E.
C. Priber, Georpe F. Harris, J. \V. Whit
ing, C. C. Burr, Frank A. Swain and my
self."
JACKSON DECLINES.
The Deputy Attorney - General
Warmly Indorses the Repub
lican Nominees.
Deputy Attorney-General Charles H.
Jackson, who received the unsolicited
nomination of Superior Judge from the
Citizens' Independent convention, has
Bent the following communication to Sec
retary Kingsbury declining the nomina
tion and giving his reasons therefor:
Sackamento, Oct. 2. 1896.
To the Secretary of the Citizens' Independent
Convention, Spreckels Building, Sun Franciscoâ
Deak Sib: Being engaged in this city during
the current m> nth on business for the Attor
ney-General's office 1 find it impossible to
make the run for the office of Judge ot the
Superior Court. While I appreciate the honor
of such a nomination, coming as it did wholly
unsolicited by me, still for business reasons I
must decline it. The Republican party
has made such excellent nominations
for this office that I make bold to bespeak for
one of them a nomination at your hands. You
have wisely chosen Hon. E. b. Sawyer as one
of your candidates, why not select Hunt, Finn.
Cook or Bonos lell from the other faction?
Having, however, no desire to dictate to those
who have so voluntarily and so highly honored
me, I remain, yours very graieiuily,
CHARLES H, JACKBON,
Nominee for Judge Superior Court, Citizens'
Independent Conventio .

posed to Have Decamped.

Criminals Sentenced.
Judge Belcher yesterday sentenced John
Webber to San Quentin for seven and a half
years for attempted burglary. Webber is the
man who was oiught while trying to rob the
residence of Reuben Lloyd, the attorney.
Antonia Lengo and Henry Nevel were each
Xi veil two years in State prison for burglary.
The jury that tried Lengo was instructed to
acquit him, but refused to do so, and brought
in a verdict of guilty of murder in the second
degree.
Judge Bahrs ordered William Brown, who
was caught witn his hand in the pocket of
William Sorlund and held by fishhooks sewed
therein, to be confined iv San Quentin for two
years.
Edward Clay was sentenced to seven yean in
Sau Quentiu for burglary.

SOUGHT FREEDOM IN A BUGGY.
Housebreakers Had Made Careful
Preparations to Prevent a
Possible Capture.
Burglars still ply their nefarious trade
with impunity in the Mission. Henry
Merritieid's residence, 728 Dolores street,
near Twenty-first, was entered by
burglars yesterday afternoon, but they
were fortunately frightened away by Mrs.
Merrifield before they were able to secure
any plunder.
"I went downtown accompanied by my
daughters to do some shopping eariy in the
day," said Mrs. Merrifield last evening,
"and returned at 2:30 o'clock in the after
noon.
"I entered through the front door and I
then attempted to open the dining-room
door, which I had locked before going
downtown. I immediately saw that some
thing was wrong, but did not suspect that
burglars were in the house. Just then I
heard a noise, the sound of moving tools,
sol called out, 'Who is there?' I then
heard the sound of scurrying feet out
through the back door, and I ran to the
front porch.
"As I reached the steps I aaw two
young men, both apparently about 20
years of age, run down the aide entrance
and into the street. They ran' down
Dolores street to Liberty and soon disap
peared. They did not look up as they
passed me, so I could not give a good de
scription of them. Both wore derby hats
and were nicely dressed."
A painter employed on a bouse near the
Mernfield residence said that a short time
before Mrs. Merrifield's return he saw two
young men drive down Dolores street in a
buggy. They halted in front of the Mer
rifie'd house and then drove on.
He thinks they hitched the horse on
Liberty street, near at hand, and as soon
as they ran from the house they hur
ried to the buggy and made their escape.
Entrance to the house was effected by
breaking out one of the glass panels in
the kitchen door and reaching in and
turning ihe key which was left in the
lock. They destroyed the lock on the
door between the kitchen and dining
room and were in the act of opening the
door between the dining-room and ball
when Mrs. Mernfield surprised them.
If the lady oi the bouse had not arrived
in the nick of time the marauders would
have ransacked the house. As it was, the
only damages were the breaking of the
glass in the kitchen door and the smash
ing ot the lock; on the door leading from
the dining-room.

4 TONOMETER and Overtone Apparatus. These Machines Have
Dissected an Octave Into Thirty-Two Sounds.
HPHE wonderfully exact and delicate
mechanicai appliances which have just
arrived at Berkeley for use in connection
with the study of experimental psychology
have been photographed and sketched by
a Call artist and are now reproduced for
the first time for the benefit of ThÂ« Call
readers.
The illustrations give a very fair and
accurate representation ol the truly unique
apparatus with which Berkeley's new pro
fessor of psychology proposes to teach the
growing native son how to penetrate some
of the darkness that, viewed from a
materialistic standpoint, ever will en
shroud the question, "W T hat is man?"
No other American university has bo
fine and costly assonment of may
be styled psychological tools. Nowhere
outside of Germany, where experimental
psychology originated, in tbe modern ac
ceptation of the term, has the completeness
of the collection been equaled.
The nrst laboratory in experimental
psychology was established by William
Wundt at Leipsic in 1879. From very early
times investigations have been made in
the field of psychology. Locke and Berke- i
ley made observations and generaliza
tions, but there was no attempt to cause a
recurrence of psychical phenomena in
Europe or in the United SiateÃ prior to
Ihe time of Weber and Fechner, who
ttudied and wrote in Germany in the first
Aalt of the present century. They were
experimenters as well as observers.
\ George Malcolm Stratton of Oakland
wild the honor to be admitted as a student
in the first laboratory of Experimental
Psychology established in Europe. Mr.
Etratton was graduated witb higd honor
and received marked distinction in Europe
among the learned psychologists. He is
the instructor in Experimental Psychology
at Berkeley. "Wundt," said Mr. Stratton,
as ht- stood amid the psychological appar
atus which he selected in Germany for the
university, "first engaged in his attempt
to experiment by getting several men ana
some apparatus together. He started in a
small way, with but a few pupils, from
that beginning a great laboratory has been
developed. He has eighteen rooms, ex
pensively fitted up for the purpose of ex
periments. The records of his works fill
twelve volumes."
The work at Berkeley will follow the
lines of German origin. One of the first
questions will be concerning the practical
value of the experiments apart from their
purely scientific importance. Observation
and experiment will *>c devoted to finding
out what various men do under fixed con
ditions which can be artificially contrived.
The fluttering of the pulse, ita accelera
tion and retardation, its sudden acces
sions of energy, all can be mapped and
charted wiih absolute fidelity. Respira
tion and its variations, the expansion or
Contraction of muscles under the influ
ence of mental impressions â in brief,
all the physical phenomena which
mental perceptions may cause â can be
automatically recorded by machinery
through a most ingenious combination of
\Â»'. nngs, electro-magnets, diais capable ol
measuring bo email a lapse of time as
1-1000 of a second, electric currents, ham
mers which fall in a predetermined period
tbrongh arcs of a circle, and bo on. These
physical phenomena are valuable for tbe
purposes of psychology, as they indicate
the precise effect of mental action, based
on fixed occurn nces, upon the body. Con
versely, the time may arrive when these
phenomena may indicate the nature oi
thoughts. The field of conjecture which
this opens up is so vast that it is seem
ingly boundless.
"Psychology," said Mr. Stratton, "is an
old science, dating back to Aristotle. His
wont, De Anima, was the first great work
on psychology- Psychology aims to know
the nature of mental life and under what
conditions mind exists; what are its
relations to the physical world, and what
the destiny of the personal mind or
tnougbt is. Here is a great philosophical
problem which can only be solved by
philosophical methods. Psychology seeks
to answer to these great questions.
"In what we caJl experimental psychol
ogy the subject has the conditions made
for him. He is purposely kept in the
dam as to what in about to happen that
be may give an answer without any
prejudice. Then a number of subjects are
t*ken and put through the same condi
ttyns and we see what the results are. In
that way we make a general rule applica
ble to the normal.
"You will see that, with the ability to
repeat the same experiment an indefinite
number of times upon different persons,
there are greater possibilities for system
than exist under merely observational
psychology. The conditions under winch
we make oar observations are artificial
and are produced and controlled bo that
their character is thoroughly understood.
Since the person who makes the experi
ment is not the person immediately con
cerned in the outcome ne is the less liable
to be biased in his ju Igment.
â¢â¢'We shall experiment largely to affect
the body through the senses in different
ways. We can, of course, influence the
organs of sense in various ways. We can
affect the eyes, for instance, by altering
KYMOGRAPH, the Clock-Propelled Drum, Which Automatically
Records Heart-Beats and the Fluttering^ of the Excited Pulse.
the character of the light that comes in,
by intensifying or diminishing it, by the
size of the field of light presented, and so
on. We can affect the ears, the organ of
smell, the temperature and touch. Pain
can be produced by affecting tbe body in
various ways, by electric stimulation, by
pressure at a certain point. Even the in
tensity of light can be made painful.
"By such methods the mental state can
be constantly affected and the contents of
ABSORBING TALES OF VANISHED MINES.
Legends of lost mines are ever new and
furnish material for the most fascinating
and adventurous of narratives. Most of
them are creditable to their authors as
monuments of invention, but there are
others which carry with them an air of
probability and often have stimulated
search in regions where the existence of
gold was not suspected. The mines of the
Yukon were suggested by the circulation
of the frontier story of the "Lake of the
Gol'ien Bar," and it is more than prob
able that the site of the famous lost Peg
Leg mine will be found in the wonderfully
rich Ranisburg district of Kern County,
but recently discovered.
The story of the lost White cement
mine has been current among tbe miners
of two generations. Early in the 50's a
man named White appeared in Horse
head Gulch with a large quantity of speci
mens of what seemed to be white clay,
imbedded in which were numberless Hakes
oi shining gold. A test of the samples
showed free gold to the value of $1000 a
ton. White was not communicative as to
the source from which he had procured
his specimens, and beyond the admissions
that the mine was located in New Mexico,
nothing could be learned of the where
abouts of the find. Persuasion was quite
lost upon the discoverer, and the miners
came to tbe conclusion to force the infor
mation from the stubborn prospector.
White was told that unless he would con
sent to guide a certain number of miners
to the place where the gold lay violence
would be nsed to compel him to do so.
Ii he would consent it was agreed that
he should have his pick of the ground and
;ne miners sbould have the rest. White
agreed, and a delegation of miners,
headed by him, set out for the camp. The
way was hard and the trip exhausting,
but all went well until the third morning
of the trip, when White was found to be
missing. The adventurers made their
way back to Horsehead Gulch and arrived
there after enduring great distress.
Another expedition was formed, consist
ing of 100 men, and the search for the
mine was continued for a long time, but
without success.
Three years af -erward White was again
seen in Salt Lake with a large quantity of
the same ore that so excited the Cali
fornia miners. He reiterated the former
stories of his discovery and its riches,
but again vanished <rom the scene tnd
never reappeared. The belief, however,
in the existence of the White cement mine
is an article of faith among the miners of
Southern California.
No story of lost mines would be com
plete without a reterence at least to the
famous Peg Leg mine.wbich John G. Smith
claimed to have discovered. In August,
1871, Smith appeared in Los Angeles with
a large amount of gold in small nuggets,
which he claimed to have extracted from
a deposit of marvelous richness shown
him by a couple of Pima Indians. Smith
refused to reveal the exact locality
of his mine, and told many
contradictory stories regarding it.
After spending all his means in riot
ous living he vanished, and about six
month afterward again came to Los An

the mind can be changed. For instance,
the presentation of variously colored liehts
is perceived mentally. The subject sees
that tbere are various colors and that is a
mental fact. The same is true when bar
monies or tones are recognized; that is
mental. The ear itself is unconscious of
any change. The perception is in the
mind. Mental changes in this way can be
made general changes which can be ob
served and known. We can note tbe
changes which follow the experiments and
the mental processes so occasioned can be
compared. These are carefully watched
and noted. The subject knowi only what
> he thinks, but his physical condition fur-
nishes certain signs that give us the means
of determining what his general state is.
"Yes," went on Mr. Stratton with in
terest and enthusiasm, "there are broad
and rough signs, like the contraction or
dilation of the eyes, the contraction of the
lips and facial muscles, which can be
easily seen and which denote the mental
condition of the subject; but there have
been discovered more delicate signs
which detect the mental state and it is in
geles even richer in nuggets than before.
Twice afierward he made like trips and
the community was highly wrought up
over the mysterious origin oi all these
riches." Attempts were made to follow
Smith, but unsuccessfully. Finally he
agreed to allow two friends into the secret
and with them Smith started for his mine.
Months elapsed, but the men did not re
turn, and later the desiccated bodies of
the two companions were found in the
desert. Smith was never heard of again.
The new Randsburg district in Kern
County is believed by many to be the site
of the longed-for Peg Leg mine.
In 1852 Wili.im Hackett and Robert
Pope arrived in Red Bluff on a prospecting
tour. The season was well advanced to
ward winter and all advised the men to
defer their expedition until spring, but
this excellent counsel was disregarded, and

can safely lay c:aim to being one of the
most artistic and unique structures in Cal
ifornia. It is 2400 ,eet above sea level, at
the terminus of the scenic railway, and
perched on a crag that overhangs Mill
Valley. The building can hardly be sail
to conform to any particular style of
archrtectnre, although Colonia is strongly
indicated.
On the side of the hotel overlooking the

graceful arches through which the most
enchanting glimpses of scenery can be ob

plainly seen, as well as a vast expanse of
country.

different persons or in the same person
under varying conditions, for one person
sees somÂ« things quicker than he can see
others. In the consideration is the power
of memory, and there are a whole class of
reactionary experiments which are not
voluntary. There are the reactions of the
foot, or the hand or of some muscle which
is unconscious. There are unconscious
changes in circulation and breathing
which can be accurately measured. The
pneumatograph records, for instance, the
character of the breathing and its fre
quency and its varying depth.
Hackett and Pope, with a couple of bnr
ros, set out for the lead waters of the Me-
Cloud River. The Indians in that early
day were troublesome anil vindictive, and
resented any invasion of their territory,
but the two friends were undeterred by
thoughts of danger, and after a month's
tramping found themselves on a small
branch of the McCloud, flowing northeast
erly down the slope of great M >unt Shasta.
Here a camp was formed and a but built,
which it was determined to remain dur-
"The voluntary reactions of the muscle
are studied. For instance, tbe subject is
requested to press a key simultaneousiy
with the appearance of a flash of light
which will be presented to him. The time
that it takes to comply with this request
can be accurately measured. Or, if two
colors are to be presented, a test is fur
nished of the speed with which he can
discriminate. Or there may be a number
of colors or a number of words, so that hi s
mental action is complicated. He cannot
react until bis mental action is complete.
Such experiments give a hint concerning
the mental processes which go on in such
cases. Then there are the direction and
alteration of attention, the strength of
attention and so on to be determined."
Turning rom these considerations Mr.
Stratton exhibited and explained the
uses of some of the more important in

building is almost ready for occupancy.
The photograph from which the accom
panying drawing was made was taken a
few days ago, at which time there were
still a few scantlings in front oj the struc
ture. These were left out in the drawing,
so that it really looks as it will when
finished.
HIPP'S CHROMOSCOPE, the Wonderful Instrument Which Divides
Time Into Intervals of One-Thousandth of a Second.
The first of these is known as Hipp's
chronoscope. The picture shows the gen
eral appearance of this device very well.
It consists of clockwork which runs tbe
pointers on the two dials and of electrical
apparatus which Bets the chronoscope
into action instantaneously. The subdi
visions on the smaller dial measure the
time out in one thousandths of a second.
The larger dial is traversed in 10 seconds
and serves as a check by which to make
up the record, giving one click to every
revolution of the pointer around the
I smaller dial.
over five miles into a narrow canyon. Be
fore a cave in the rocks tbe bear lay dead.
With the natural instincts of prospectors
the two men entered the cave intending
to explore it, but their attention was
quickly diverted from ihat purpose by the
evidences that they had unwittingly come
upon a formation that indicated the pres
ence of rich gold-bearing quartz in amaz
ing quantities. After that they left
the hut and took up their abode
near the cave. Ail winter was spent in
detaching the ore and separating the rich
from the poor. When snmmerame Pope
loaded the two burros with all they
could carry and hastened to Red Bluff,
where he sold it for $2000.
He made immediate preparations for a
return, and, accompanied by a number of
miners, started to join his partner, but
when about twenty miles from his desti
nation the party came upon the fleshless
skeleton of Hackett tied to a burned sap
.ing and showing every indication of
having been tortured and mutilated by
the Indians. The effect upon Pope of this
awful accident was to destroy his reason.
He became violently insane and one night
disappeared and was never seen again.
The secret of the Bears Nest mine died
with him, and it has been numbered with
the lost. The search ior it is still con
tinued, and some day it may be rediscov
ered. It is a tradition of Shasta that
miners love to dwell upon.
The distant Yukon region furnishes the
story of the Lake of the Golden Bar.
Hamilton Gait, Oharles Ulnch and Wal
ter Standford, three prospectors, started
north from Butte, Montana, in August,
1884, and continued their journey for
eight weeks until the headwaters of the
Yukon River was reached. Here in a lase
they found a small island which abounded
in gold. One nugget weighing six pounds
was discovered and others of less weight
in abun lance. During the short summer
thes9 men estimated they had cached no
less than $50,000, which they found too
heavy to pack and hiÂ«i until they would
return when winter was over. The jour
ney home was fatal to all but Ulrich, who
eventually turned up at Fort Wrangei
withsloooin gold in his beit. An attempt
to locate the lake of the treasure was un
successful. It is lost to the world until
some lucky miner rediscovers it.
Tiie Lost Cabin mine is still &v active
tradition of the plains. It was discov
ered over forty years aÂ«o by Kit Carson,
the famous scout, James Kinney and a
halfbresd, whose name has been forgotten.
This mine was located on Cabin Creek, an
affluent of the Missouri, and about 700
miles northwest of Cheyenne, in the Black
Hills country. The discoverers brought
home all they could carry of gold nug
gets, but on attempting to return to the
mine in the following spring the Indians
were so numerous that the trip was aban
loned. Tae two companions of the scout
were subsequently killed and Kit Carson
was too mucn engaged in fighting Indians
to look up mines. He made an attempt in
later years but failed.
Journals of the House of Commons were
began in 1547 and regularly printed after
this date.
In this exquisitely accurate and so to
speak microscopic measurement of a fleet*
*ng second there may be very slight
changes in the chronoscope, by reason of
temperature or other climatic conditions.
Even the electric current, which sets the
chronoscope in motion, may delicately
vary, notwithstanding the employment of
electro-magnets, which are made as nearly
perfect as possible. To correct this there
has been invented what is known as the
control hammer.
The last-named device consists princi
pally of a heavy weight, which, attached
to a lever, falls through varying arcs of a
circle, accordingly as it is gauged or set.
The control hammer does not really con
trol, but when it is attached to the chrono
soope it records with unimpeachable accu
racy. The weight or hammer is raised
through the prescribed arc, and is held up
by an electro-magnet.
When the current is shut off the ham
mer falls and touches the springs and
here another electric current makes an in
stantaneous record. The exact time which
is required for the faliing of the hammer
through a definite distance is, of course,
absolutely known. So the central ham
mer notes all variations in the chrono
scope and makes that instrument as
nearly perfect for the measurement of in
finitesimal periods of time as anything ol
human make can well be.
The friction of the point on the paper
affects the length of the marks caused by
the tuning fork, but does not change the
speed with which it records in the least.
Applying this a scale can be prepared.
The waves of the tuning fork appear upon
the blackened paper like billows traced
out in white scratches. It may be added
that only one make of batteries is uÂ«ed
for starting the chronoscope, it having
been determined that the current of these
is the most constant.
Ti:e apparatus for producing tones and
fine sub ivisions of tones is in several
parts. Outwardly it consists of an organ
bellows, operated by a treadle, two boxes
of reeds and a large funnel-shaped affiir.
The treadle can operate all or singly.
The funnel emits the tone which is ordi
narily described in musical notation as
great C. The two boxes of reeds are fitted
with a series of small stops, and on the
from of each of these stops is painted the
number of vibrations per second which
the reeds with which they are connected
respectively make.
There are tiiirty-two stops to each of the
boxes. One box is known as the tonom ter
and this subdivides the sounds usually in
cluded in the scops of an octave into
thirty-two sounds. These collectively
embrace all tbe harmonies included in an
octave. The other box is known as tna
overtone apparatus, and gives the over
tones proceeding from the funnel or
trumpet. In addition to the vibrations
the harmonic relations of the tones are
indicated. It will be seen that these tone
making concerns possess startling possi
bilities in an otherwise entirely quiet
room.
There is one other clockwork device
which merits description. This is the
kymograph. The use of this is to turn
around a brass drum at a fixed rate of
sped. To this brass drum is affixed a
roll of delicately smoked paper. This
paper can be used for holding an auto
matically made record of the beating of
the heart, or of the pulse, or the respira
tion of the subject who is undergoing in
vestigation. The heart is recorded by the
aid of a pneumatic tube, the pulse by
pressure upon the artery. When the
paper is dipped in a fixative like sheliac,
the record of all those physical phenomena
which were induced by contrived mental
conditions becomes a permanent history
and can be filevl away by itself or with
others as a memorial of this new advance
ment in the me of a physical inquiry into
the human mind.
The University of California has not yet
provided tbe rooms necessary for the
laboratory of experimental psychology in
Berkeley. Mr. Stratton says that at least
eight rooms should be provided. These
should be near together. It is not neces
sary that all should be en suite, but they
ought to be all electrically connected.

THE HAGUE, Holland, Sept. 16.â 0n
the map of Europe Holland occupies such
a little space, just a little corner that
might be clipped from an outlying section
of California and never be missed. From
Rotterdam in the south to Amsterdam in
the north an express train shoots over the
level country iv one hour and fifteen
minutes. From the windows you may
catch a glimpse of Delft, with its wind
mills and canals and waving green trees,
perpetuated in blue and white ware in the
great factories near the station. Another
expanse of deep green fields, cut by tiny
rivers of water, and the train goes thunder
ing into The Hague, 'S Gravenhage, to be
more correct and a great deal more Dutch.
People tumble out of the carriages, there
is a great deal of slamming and banging
of doors, shouting and calling in the sten
torian and guttural Dutch tongue, and
away goes the train through the imposing
streets of the mipiature capital, past the
trees of the little Queen's park, out again
into the interminable flat fields, with the
cones of flax in a vanishing perspective,
and at the end a shimmering gray-^reen
cloud, low on the horizon, that may mean
smoke, but in reality is the sea, beating
on the long white beaches of t-caeven
ingen.
Suddenly the country begins to blaze.
From dim and gray and wet green it
turns to vivid scarlet, golden yellow,
purple, violet and creamy white. Haar
lem and the tulip-beds are in the distance.
The tulips are as impossibly bright as the
flowers in a carpet; they look unreal.
But when the train stops for breath and
more passengers little boys and girls with
light northern eyes and tow hair under
black and whit? caps besiege, each com
partment and for the merest trifle, for
nothing at all, 'â¢Meguffrouw" or "Myn
heer," they will part with bunches of the
most tangible, thick, soft flowers, fastened
together securely with a wisp of hay, and
a disregard to color that may put fas
tidious teeth on edge.
At last the train is off again and in
an incredibly short time you are zigzagging
your way through the complicated narrow
streets of Amsterdam. In less than one
hour and a half you have crossed the prin
cipal part of Holland. The brave little
country is justly proud of itself, of its he
roic history, of its past and present pros
perity, of its great men and its
great pictures, of its past hardships and
battles and struggles with human enemies
and the more deadly dangers of the storm
and the sea. And above all it is proud of
its little plump and pretty fair-haired
Queen. On the 31st of August all Holland
celebrated the royal birthday, the fifteenth
or sixteenth at the most. In the villages
the schoolmasters led their flocks* in
bright orange sashes, with orange cock
ades in their boys' caps and orange mari
golds in wreaths around every litile girl'B
sunburned face. Dawn each street they
pattered, making the noise of a whole
troop of cavalry, and wherever there was
an inn or an important farmhouse the
whole cavalcade stopped, and standing Â«s
straight as their little bow legs and their
enormous kiumpen will permit, there
poured forth their infant sou. 3 in patriotic
songs with a lung power that was enviable,
especially at a distance. Then they burst
into shrill checs and shouted :
"Lang leve de Konigin!"
This eaded the ceremony so far as the
singing is concerned, but the reward must
be immediately forthcoming or an awful
gloom settles upon each face. The reward
is in the shape of very small, round cakes,
8s hard an bullets; in fact, they would
Indisputably have saved the day at Bunker
Hill if they had been used as ammunition.
The cakes never fail, however, ultimately
to restore the general cheerfulness, and
they march on with radiant faces and full
mouths, giving muffled cheers for every
body. The Queen herself can hardly be
happier than these very small subjects.
They are important factors in the gen
eral economy, for they number legion in a
limited population, and the Dutch father
and mother, perhaps in view of the cbas
teninc experiences of their hardworked
future lives, do not believe in efficacious
discipline at an eariy age. The bicycle is
the object of their particular attention.
They call it "a feets"â the abbreviation of
velocipede â and woe betide the woman
who rides alone through a peaceful and
apparently solitary village, along a sunny
road between two rows of stately trees,
with a convenient "sloot" to fall into on
either side of the road.
The children spring up from the ground
apparently, first two, then four, then
twenty, they signal the little fiends at a
distance, and attach themselves to the
unfortunate rider with howls and yells
that pierce the ear and the quaking heart.
There is nothing to do but to run the
gauntlet, to fly at full speed in order to
escape their outstretched feet, and sticss,
and grasping hands, as you would escape
a hungry pack of wolves.
The roads are generally good and the
villages themselves are like :he pictures
Neuhuys (pronounced Noyhouse), Artz
and Israels love to paint. The doors are
generally open and the strong light and
shadow bring into prominence the busy
figures of the women working at the flax,
knitting or scrubbing their hard floors.
Israels has represented every phase of
Dutch life on sea and land. In shadow and
sunlight, in winter and summer. The
other modern Dutch masters have con
fined themselves to special branches.
ONE OP MESDAg's MARINE EFFECTS.
Adolf Art z, one of the most distinguished
of the pupils of Israels, studies the sep
arate figures in an out-of-door light; his
shepherdesses and goatherds, women
gathering potatoes, little squat, sturdy
children playing, animate generally an
autumnal landscape; wide and mel
ancholy plains, with grayish blue grass
and silrer gray skies.
When he represents sunlight it is the
pale light that may at any moment van
ish bebind the clouds; a windmill turns
on the horizon and faint mists obscure
the distance.
Jongkind, who died a few years ago and
whose pictures have now gained a value
he never coveted for them, painted the
freshness and the glitter of his beloved
Dutch landscape, to which he was for
many years a stranger. He was a distant
relative of Corot. brother to Diaz, and to
Daubigny the closest friend. He painted
moonlieht with a delicacy that he
learned from Corot; in his energetic day
light studies he learned from Diaz the
value of thickly modeled light almost
like low relief, and from Daubigny he ap
preciated the sharp value of a few keen
accents, in the modeling of clouds, or
water, or houses, or the little figures that
are one, two, three little splashes of paint,
and which make his studies vibrate with
human interest. He painted in Paris,
around the Pont Neuf, in the old streets;
on the Norman seacoast. On this he
traveled to Belgium and portrayed the
swarming streets of little towns. It is a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896
curious fact that in 1852 he received a
medal in Paris and that until the exposi
tion of 1889 no further work of his was ac
cepted by the salon juries.
It was after this most remarkable ex
hibition that Jongkind was recognized
as a strong link between the school of
Fontainebleau and modern art. While he
did not scruple to use the methods and
effects of the men for whom his admira
tion amounted to reverence, he made his
own work so distinctly personal that it
may be recognized at once in any exhibi
tion for its own Btrong and characteristic
charm.
The two brothers William and Jacob
Maris and Mauve are the poets of Hol
land. They make of the landscape the
country of a dreamy so delicate, so ten
der, so luminous and simple. The har
monies of very early naming, tho in
definite beauties of the twilight attract
them, and they render them with rare
success.
In Mesdag we have two personalities,
the great marine painter and the enthusi
astic collector. Mesdag paints the Bea as
few men in or out of Holland bay* painted
it. The windy sky, torn into shreds of
cloud and mist, the sea disturbed and
shaken as with the shudder of an ap
proaching storm, he represents by means
of a color that is nearly always silver and
rose and gray. Rarely does he introduce
the heavy, dark sails and somber houses
of the fishing villages, as a less observant
eye would portray them, by the force of
strong contrasts. He bathes his canvas in
light, and to stand before a very good
Mesdasr, for no master is evenly excellent,
is to giance out of a gold-framed window
and to receive a quick impression of the
sea as it looks at sea, tossed and threat
ening or smooth as oil, with thick and
quivering reflections from the clouds or
the passing boats, or the great flaming
ball of the sun that is his one temptation
to introduce a flash of vivid color.
No one who visits The Hague should
miss seeing Mesdag'a private gallery,
which occupies two whole floors of his
magnificent house. Mrs. Mesdag is also a
painter, and their home is the center for
all the intelligent and cosmopolitan cir
cles in the city.
The gallery is composed largely of the
woiks of the school of 1830, to whom the
Hollanders owe so much â Jean Francois
Millet in a hundred drawings, Corot and
Daubigny, Diaz and Rousseau â till a sense
of almost overwhelming enjoyment and
envy takes possession of the bewildered
visitor who is not hurried, who may come
as often as he pleases, who may sit for an
hour absorbed before a masterpiece with
out the sensation that he is being hunted
out by an impatient guide or a politely
bored and expectant footman. The Ital
ian school, the modern English and the
most striding modern Dutchmen are all
represented.
Sensations come thick and fast in this
big palatial studio-house, with thick rugs,
polished floors, carved and heavy old
furniture and the jewels set like mosaics
in the walls. Van Dyck Beown.

Jtfave you ever considered the educa
tional chances of life in this City? Not
those inclosed by the four walls of a
schoolhouseâ those I deem less than may
be found in the country, where individ
ualism has not quite disappeared â but
those found in outside life, and which
may be enjoyed alike by gamin and
prince. I say may be enjoyed, purposely,
instead of are enjoyed alike, because,
given the same opportunities and two
people, one will make a better use of them
than will the other. Very lilcely the
gamin will see more than the prince.
We all have Eeen men with little schol
arly education who show more practical
knowledge of life than an erudite profes
sor. One of these may break every rule of
syntax while telling of some new machine
or process, but he will convey his mean
ing straight to the understanding. There
are men who never had to do hard labor
in their lives who can tell how everything
is made, from a cream cheese to a moni
tor, and all because they have taken the
education which is all about us.
Let us suppose a boy can read ; most
boys can; if they were not allowed the
two years at school which ought to ac
complish that, they would learn like Sam
Weller'o father and Maggie from the signs.
Those same signs and advertisements are
very good primers, terse and trenchant,
and about the things we all use and see.
The illustrations are not always the most
chaste, neither are those in the books
open to the scholar; there never has been
found a way to pass through life without
coming into contact with the sin and the
sadness of life.
Right here the difference in dispositions
will show itself. While some will gaze
entranced on dancing girls who forgot to
dress and devour certain pink papers,
others will look long at the pictured ani
mals on the circus poster, and still others
wiil spell out the news on the bulletin'
boards. Without a cent one can keep
abreast with the times by means of these
boards and the phiianthropically spread
out paper below; and without price he
may sit in a comfortable room and read
the most expensive magazines oi the day â
an education in themselves.
Pictures are everywhere, good and bad,
and one may learn, as one must anyway
by an inward sense which pictures are
worth more than a glance. A wonderful
art gallery is free one day in each month
to whoever will climb the hill, and art
stores all over the City hang out their
choicest wares to feast the eyes of the
passing crowd.
The windows of a great store are a lesson
to many who have had average opportuni
ties. The delicately clad ladies and dainty
children therein show how the other fiftieth
of the world lives.and though the ligures are
palpable shams the street boy learns early
that the real creatures are often no less a
sham, and minus the clotues would be as
common. The windows show, too, how
the interior of a mansion looks and what
beautiful useless things go to make a room.
They show the things needful, the things
beautiful and the things neither one nor
the other, but fashionableâ the books be-
ing read and the people being talked
about It would seem that a stu lent of
windows might be dropped into marble
halls without showing awe or awkward
ness.
There are speakers for every subject;
there are many lessons to learn and others
to unlearn listening to public speakers
and corner orators. It seems to me that
the very lampposts have been educated
during this campaign. In more serious
vein there are learned lecturers whose lore
is free. No one clean, however poor,
would be turned away from a university
extension lecture or from the Academy of
Sciences. And take thi3 last as an edu
cator â how long might one study there,
growing more and more fascinated all the
time?
I wonder how many of the people whoi
travel in them know all about the work
ing of an electric-car, or even a cable?
Yet these things are open and free as the
air around us. The great wheels and en
gines turn and pant before our eyes if we
would but look, and there is always some
one willing to explain. Men who run en
gines and work with electricity and do all
those wonderful, mysterious things are
glad to tell about it to people who care to
hear. Even though laboring under the
unsurmountable disadvantage of being a
woman, and thereby being incapable of
understanding anything with more than
two wheels, I never hesitate to ask about
things, and never fail to find out, if it is
something I ought to know. The signs of
"No Admittance" are weak as water when
stormed by an interested lad's eye, and
crusty, oil-spotted old fellows will tell all
the eager questioner asks. It is only a
question of whether lie really wants to
know.
The whole world of commerce lies before
him in freightcars ana ships. Can any
boy here tell all about the rigging and
loading of ships, how many kinds of boats
there are, and the powers which move
them? It is no one's fault if the boy can
not; the school is free. Geography ought
to grow most fascinating after a morning
on the water front. Where do all the
wonderful winged ships go? How long
are they away? What do they carry to
other lands, and what do they bring back ?
How many men does it take to sail a ship?
Where does all that coal come from, and
what is coal? The boy may as well camp

there a while if he intends to learn the
whole lesson.
What are those things digging to'the
bottoms of ships? And this brings pic
tures and stories â from the free librariesâ
of all the creatures creeping and crawling
in the ocean's bed. Then there are fish,
great and small, each to be learned by
sight and by name, with value for food or
for other things, and more book 3to oe
read. All this, if the boy will. If he
would rather, there are new and choice
swear words to learn, things to steal and
drunken men to tease.
He may sit at ease and learn wonderful
lessons in engineering and building, may
see how a great structure plants itself and
grows up to the clouds, may learn how
streets are made and paved and watch
their wear and tear.
No common animals need be strange;
birds and beasts from the world over are
in our parks, and flowers and trees. Each
year there are exhibitions of products and
manufactures â better, if studied, than a
term of school. There is a price, but no
boy who cares need stay away for moneys
sake. There are too many Kind men and
women ready to share a ticket with the
little brother who really cares to go.
Then there is a permanent exhibit of the
products of our own State â geography,
botany and general information sealed up
in bottles.
Do the men and women who have
grown up in this City, with all its schools
before them, really know their lessons?
No time, perhaps. We have all of us
had time to gossip, to walk aimlessly
about, to read utter trash, to moan over the
want of opportunities while we walked
past greater ones. It is the boy who ob
serves who learns, and the boy is father
to the man.
It is utter folly to take a boy who all his
life has been learning lessons with his
eyes and put him at work piling blocks to
develop the multiplication tables. He can
digest stronger meat than that, and unless
he gets it will waste his time and blame
the teacherâ justly, tooâ who "never
learned him nothing."
After this recess we may return to school
and pass on to the class in morals and
manners. There are many moral lessons
in our City, most of them taught back
ward. The great City Hall is full of moral
lessons from basement to dome. A police
court teaches more kinds of lessons than
it is supposed to deal in. Besides the
lessons of the results of wrongdoing and
the policy of keeping in the straight and
narrow way, it gives illustrated lessons in
carelessness, machine justice and the
criminal effect of involuntary poverty.
Any one needing moral instruction may
attend the Monday morning class in
putting petty offenders through the mill.
If it doesn't make him resolve to be good
and send him away with new and sad
ideas he is past learning. Lessons of
mercy are there too, when a Judge gives
a boy another chance, but it is mercy
sadly deflected from its natural course
when it sends him back to his native mud
and puts him in the same temptations.
There is a lesson for the hasty one in the
spectacle of a murderer who committed
his crime in the heat of passion, to his
lasting regret and disgrace. And among
the rest is a lesson of self-respect and
manners to be learnedâ converselyâ from
lawyers.
In the higher courts I fear all the les
sons must be read backward, bat they are
there in the spectacle of unpunished mur
derers and twisted laws and unblushing
adventuresses, in purchased eloquence
and endless quibbling.
Lessons in public economy, too, are
written on the soles of boots displayed
through office-windows, and smile from
the helmets of lolling officers. Oh, yes;
there is food for thought in the City Hall.
Our City has one of the best schools of
foreign customs and costumes to be found
in the world. We have a small China, in
all its tawdry splendor and its varied
smells; Italy is here with her red
turbaned, peaceable anarchists and num
berless etti made of paste. Nearly every
nation has a colony.
I almost forgot the theology class.
You may study all its grades, including
the A. P. A. and the convent, Salvatior.
Army and High Church. And it is but just
to say that, however shabby your coat,
the High Church will welcome you as
cordially if not so effusively as the army.
These are a few things to be learned in
a city school. There are others. They
are not to be counted. We walk past
them like the child treading on mignonette
while reaching up to the tall tulips to find
the odor. Olive Hsydeh.
A Jkir\g

JKe Frieze ir\ the
Horace Hill
Palace
Ar\ Original Piece of
Work by Arthur
MatheWs'
Brush
The most original and meritorious piece
of art work that has been produced in San
Francisco in a long time is the frieze
which Arthur Mathews has just finished
for Horace Hill's new home, on Sacra*
mento and Laguna streets. This frieze \%
very likely the only one of its kind in ex
istence. It is the only frieze of a highly
artistic character in any residence in Cali
fornia, and indeed the only piece of inte
rior decoration of the kind ever executed
by an artist resident of the State.
The principal peculiarity of the frieze
painted by Mr. Mathews is that it is an
endless one. That is it is not a series of
panels set in certain places, but one long
picture, passing all the way around the
room and really having no beginning nor
ending point. It is three feet deep and
has a total length of 108 feet. On two
walls it is thirty-two feet long and on the
two others it is twenty-two feet long.
As the room in which the frieze is placed
is Grecian in style Mr. Matbews has fol
lowed that theme in his work. The idea
of the frieze is "The Arts of Peace" and
the whole field of that is covered.
; â  That portion of ( the frieze that first
strikes the person entering the room is
over the mantle and . might be called the
beginning.' It ; represents "Music and
the Dance." The figures, in this, are lull of
grace and action, being skillfully drawn
and well composed. Every line is easy'
and harmonious. In this group are build 4
ings and statuary that represent the arts?
of sculpture and architecture. '
-'Following the frieze' around to the left
"Romance" is represented by figures and
landscape that tell some of the stories of
ancient Greece, "Poesy" is also repre
sented in this group.
On the wall opposite the fireplace are
represented the ''Industries." This theme
is also extended to the wall on the south
and covers fishing, sheet. herding, sailing
the seas, merchandising, and tilling the
soil. The minor industries, such as spin
ning and other household duties, are also
represented. This carries the frieze all
around the room, and the observer will, in
following it, have come back to the group
over the fireplace. ' : â¢ ' - J
In the treatment of the "Arts of Peace" '
Mr. Mathews has followed the modern
school of decoration. That is, principally,

management of color, form and values
rather than elaborate detail. "' It is by do

; ; In tone the frieze is a warm gray, inclin
ing, toward yellow in the 1 lights and to
browns in the shadows. Nearly all of the
greens are warm in tone, except in small
spaces, where a little, cold and ' dark, is
used with* a pleasing effect. The room is
finished in dark red mahogany and the
warm tones seem a part of it and yet are
in good contrast. â  â  â¢
The work of executing this frieze was a
long one. It was commenced last March
and the designing alone consumed several
weeks of hard study. At least two months
of solid work was consumed in painting,
but the canvas had to be retouched from
time to time until about the beginning of
last month, when it was placed in posi
tion, â¢ j
* It was impossible to buy canvas for the
frieze, bo it had to be made. This Mr.
Ma thews did himself, so as to be sure that
the materials used were of the best quality.
The canvas is of the "absorbent" kind
which gives a dead surface with oil colors
and enables the work to be seen from any
direction without reflections. The frieze is
not : mounted on ! stretchers '_ and ') set in
panels but is pasted directly to the wall.
; In painting this frieze many things had
to be considered that are not apparent at a
first glance. As there are windows in the
room it follows that there is more light in
one place than another, and to overcome
this the picture had to be painted accord
ingly. The part over the windows had to
be painted in a different key. â ';WHO HAVE GRAPES TO SELL SMILE COMPLACENTLY

Grapes are grapes this year. The man
who i>as them smiles complacently and
says grapes are money. Queer how many
things grapes can be! Some years they
are dru s.
The picking season is at its heirht now;
pickers are in demand, wineries ate
crushing all daylong, and all day the bic
wagons come down the roads piled high
with full boxes or rattle back again with
empty ones.
The i entle hills in all the grape valleys
bear undulating lines of low green vines
looking bare of fruit until one gets close,
and then revealing treasures of purple,
pink or white clusters, hang hidden be
neath the branches. There isn't much
landscape hidden by grapevines; they do
not rise enough from the ground to
change the appearance oi the surround
ings â not nearly so much as a crop of
corn would. And there is nothing of
nature in a vineyard. Who ever knew
Nature to grow anything in parallel lines?
In a section devoted to grape culture one
may stand on any slight eminence and
see, as far as he can see, line aftt-r line,
sloping up and then down, following and
bringing into relief every curve or hollow
in the land.
It isn't beautiful, but it looks thrifty; it
has the air of prosperity and ppick-and
spanness about it which comes with value
and care. Running through nearly every
vineyard, cutting it in two or in four, are
rows of orchard trees, like sentinels, or
like a few grown-up people watching the
play o: many children. In some hollow,
nearly hiudeti by trees, and vines allowed
to climb, is the house, and if the place be
large there are many outbuildings and a
winery. Nearly all these buildings are
white, contrasting veil with the deep
green of the vines and the brown of the
earth. Roads and paths intersect the
vineyard, and now, if one passes along
these roads, at the sound of a footstep, up
pops head after head from among the
vines, where the stooping pickers have
been hid.
A hopyard is more picturesque, per
haps, but less satis actory this year than
a vineyard. The man with grapes has no
grudge against Providence or his neigh
bor, for the crop is gooi in qua.ity, though
light in quantity, and every grape sells at
a good price. It is a golden harvest that
is being gathered in ali over the State this
month, greater than any for many years â
a boon from kindly nature to her burdened
people.
Around the little town of Livermore are
vineyards in every direction. One can
take no road that does not lead to one.
In all directions the bills are crowned
with vine's to their very summits, and in
all directions come and go the great four
horse loads of grapes. Grapes everywhere I
Great luscious grapes of every shade and
degree of sweetness; great piles of grapes
in front of the wineries ; great piles of
boxes full of grapes stacked about the
vineyards. It would seem that there are
grapes enough in this region to supply
the State. It takes a small army to
gather them in.
Some small vineyards hire two or three
families to pick and then there's fun.
They all comeâ father, mother and a

GOOD MANNERS FOR HORSES
A man came to see me recently on a
matter of business. He rode a handsome,
lightly stepping bay mare, and during cur
interview, which took piace out of floors,
he di mounted and stood talking with the
bridle-rein thrown over his arm.
"I came up," he said, "to see you about
thatâ" Then the mare thrust her head
forward and uoward, jerking the rein
free, and the ies: of the sentence was lost
in the grab her master made to recover
his hold upon her. Securing the rein
again, he gave it a turn about his left
hand and resumed the conversation,
which related to pasturage. "Of course
it's stubble," he said, "bat there's nothing
like it iorâ look out there, will you?"
This last was addressed to the mare, who
had ducked her head Lei ween her fore
feet, nearly ursetting tl c speaker by the
jerk. He hauled her nose up again, and,
before he could proceed further, she made
a sidewise turn, striking her head against
my shoulder, and then giving it a to^s
which knocked her owner's hat off. He
pick-ti it up and went on talking. Dur- |
ing the w ole conversation the animal j
kept up a constant motion, jerkins lier I
head up and down, stepping from side
to side to the imminent peril of our toes,
rubbing against her master and conduct
ing herself altopether so much after tne
fashion of a spo.led child that at last 1 be
came impatient.
"Cannot you make that mare behave
herself ?" I said.
"No," was the reply, "she's nervous.
There isn't a mean liairin the creatur 's
bead, but she's just naturally restless and
uneasy. "
Just then she "stepped over," unex
pectedly, and brought cue foot down
forcibly upon my tenderest tee. A quick
jerk at the bit backed her off, but my
temper was quite spoiled for that day.
"I'd teach her to stand still or 1 would
send her to the boneyard," I said, irri
tated by pain. The man was full of apol
ogies. He wouldn't have had it happen
for a good deal. He was awfully sorry,
but it was just naturally impossible to
make that mjire keep still, and presently
he mounted and rode off.
A horse should be taught something
more than to pull and to back, to carry
weight and go at the various utility gaits.
He should be taught good manners in
addition to the-<e things. It is a compara
tively easy thing to do this witn a young
colt, but while far more difficult it is not
impossible to inculcate lessons in depoit
ment into th- brain of an old horse. The
Icreamrftis not like a dog in this respect.
He can always learn new tricks.
The first ti ng necessary is to get con
trol of his head. If the animal has al
ways been allowed to travel with his nose
thrust forward, or if he has been com
pelled to do this by the use of a tight
overhead check, you will nave some diffi
make a ton. Your heart would falter and
your back would ache to think of fillin â¢
thirty-two of these boxes in a day, but it
hÂ«s been done. That w< uld be good wages
if it could be kept OP, but few do it at all,
and some average half a ton adav through
the season. "Sull," they say, "it is living
wages and we are glad to have it to do."

IN A BUSY VINEYARD OF LIVERMORE VALLEY WHERE NO CHINESE ARE EMPLOYED
deep chill breath of air makes motion a
pleasure. The fathers and mothers move
their bands so fast the bunches nY in
every direction, all of them, however,
lighting in the box; the young lads and
Ja-ses, neighbors, and often bashful sweet
hearts, pick side by side, growing more
saucy and happy than usual beneath that
culty at the outset. Do not despair, how
ever; a little patience will produce won
derful results in this regard. To begin
with, you must train the horse so that
yon can bring his head in from its usual
nearly horizontal carriage. Until you
can do this you can make no progress.
The best method of g.ving tnis first
lesson is both pretty and interesting.
You must teach the animal to come
toward you when you tap him, with a
whip, on the breast. To do this stand in
front of him with the whip in your right
hand, tip downward. Now, taking a rein
in each hand, close' to the bit, strike the
horse sharply on the chest. He will
probably start back and try to pull
away from you, but keep your hoid
upon the reins, speak quietly to
him and strike him again. Keep it up
until he makes a little movement toward
you, as he will do, sooner or later. When
he does this loosen your hold on the r,ein?,
pat him and praise him, letting him
understand thus that he has pleased you.
Then proceed as before. He will quickly
learn that tne way to avoid the whip is to
come to you, and you have taken the tirst
step toward controlling his head. As he
comes toward you a slight pressure on the
bit will arc bis neck and bring his nose
in toward his chest, making him what Is
called "light in hand." You will find
this alone a great advantage, as when
rid ng him if he thrusts hi.- head forward
and bears on the bit, a tap with the whip
on the chest will serve to bring his nose
in and ease the pull upon your bridle-arm.
This is a lesson that any woman can
teach a horse. I have myself taught a
spirited fi;iy to come to me from a dis
tance of several paces when I stand before
her whip in bund. The main thing is to
make the creature understand that he has
nothing to fear from the whip so long as
he is obedient. Do not be afraid of a
horse. Always remember that he is far
more afraid of you than you are of him.
He has learned that the creature that
stands upright and has hands is his
master, and it is your place not to let him
forget this.
Now, having gotten his head into the
proper perpendicular position, do not tfy
to teach him anything further at this
leÂ«son, but, say the next day, put on a
double b'idleâ that is, a bridle with curD
and snaffle bits, bring him toward you
with the whip, and get him light in hand,
that is, with nose in and head perpendicu
lar, stand at his right sde and, with the
right curb rein in your ieft hand and the
right snuffle rein in your right, quite near
the bit, draw your hands gently apart,
being carelul not to jar or hurt the horse,
but keeping a steady tension until he
opens his mouth. When he does this re
lax the reins and pat him. Repeat this
lesson say twice, daily, for a few minutes
at a time, until he opens his mouth with

making slow pick ng they are a healthy,
wholesome lot. They are working to
gether, making more than they eat.
The next vineyard is larger, about 200
acres. The foreman looks askance at the
camera, and has no welcome for tne
stranger within his gates.
"There i ain't noihin' to see and the
pickers is way down tne other end of the
place," he asserts, very grumpily.
Calmly impervious to snubs, we plod
to the other end, which, by the way. is ia
the middle, and there we find the reason
out resistance at a gentle pressure on the
bits. Teen practice with him until y>u
obtain the same result with the snaffle
alone. You will find, in a very short
time, that by these lessons you have es
tablished a means of communication be
tween yourself and the horse, through
the bit. Action in a horse soon becomes
instinctive. Â±iis motor impulses are
largely reflex.
If you have not n double bridle at hand
you can accomplish the flexions of head
and jaw by the use of a rope in connection
with the curb Dit. Pass the rope throngh
the animal's mouth, drawing the end
through the bit ring on either side. Now

ends of the rope in your right hand ami

hands apart as before, making a little

SOME FOUR-FOOTED SOLDIERS
Thp use of do s in war has been described
in The Scnpay Call. Several foreign
armies are training dog 3as scouts, sen
tries and messengers in war, and experi
ments show that they can be xised suc
cessfully. For many years also have
pigeons, although not four-footed ani
mals, been used as messengers in war.
During the Franco-Prussian war, a erpal
many messages were sent out of the be
leaguered city of Paris, and by such
means comrr unicaton with the outside
world was maintained. But there are
other animals also u^ed, and the foremost
among them is the well-known horse.
Next to tho dog, the horse stands at the
head of the animal kingdom in docility to
man's will, and intelligence in carrying
out what be is taught. He is used both as
a fighting animal and a transport animal.
The gulls seem to know the old lady and
to take kindly to her. They will perch

Down the road as we go back we pass
some of these weary gentlemen camped
by a bridge. They look lazily good

not turn that machine in their direction
they will talk to us all day.
"Why dd they quit?"

The cavalry and light artillery mon
opolize him as a fighting ani
mal, and he has been known to
imbibe his rider's feelings to such an ex
tent that he will not only boldly charge
an enemy, but will assist, by hiting and
kicKing, to do all damage possible to him.
But valuable as the horse is in this par
ticular, yet it is as a beast of burden, as a
transport animal, that his use principally
comes. The best of soldiers are valueless
without food and shelter i nd munitions of
war, nnd to carry these and keep the army
well fed and clothed and in good health is
the first and most earnest desire of every
commander. Tuerefore, in the wagon
train the horse is even more valuabie than
to carry the cavalryman, who cart be dis
pensed with, or drag the cannon, which
can be dragged by other animals.
Yet the horse gives way to the humble
and "cussed" mule as a transport animal.
This beast of burden is hardy, sure-footed,
able to go anywhere that a man can find
a footing, and take a load with him. He
is the hardiest of beasts and easy to feed.
Although we say '"obstinate as a mule"
we must not forget the dogged persever
ance that goes hand in hand with this
quatity, and though he is often vicious, as
most half-breeds are, he atones for it by
his pluck, and in these days of light guns
his value even as a fighting animal in car
rying them over narrow mountain roads
is beyond telling.
i'itck-pon es are also used like the mule
\n mountain warfare. They are a sort of
pocket edition of the mule and are infe
rior to them in strength and ability, bnt
cost little to keep. The donkey and bul
lock are used for purposes of transport in
many countries, but there is much doubt
as to their expediency, and if other ani
mals can be procured it is best to give
these two up. They eat so much and fall
away so rapidly when they do not have
the best and plenty of food that when a
country is reached where the food supnly
is limited it is, indeed, a doubtful question
bow to feed them.
Among fighting animals the horse
stands supreme for courage and endurance
combined, but almost coeval with him ia
the elephant. W T e know that tho ancHent
Romans nsed these animals, since they
took the idea from Hannibal in hi? in
vasion of Italy. In those days this huge
beast was in fact a fighting animal, and
we have many authentic accounts of how
he carried his rider hither and thither in
combat, crushing and tramping his foes
and giving to the leaders a vantage point
from which to watch the combat. To-day,
however, his usefulness is confined entirely
to that of a transport animal, since
the great brute has apparently lost all
stomach for righting since the introduc
tion of firearms. He is used to draw the
heaviest field and siege batteries, but near
the battle-ground the smell of powder or
on. Where? Oh, maybe to the city
maybe to some other grape town. Of
course the boss will take on Chinese; he
don't know how to treat white men any
how. Expects them to work six days in
a week!"
Never have I heard such frankly con
fessed vagrancy. I merition that most
people have to work six days and do
chores on the seventh.
"Well, we don't do it, and we don't
have to."
We may as well stop at this small field
of grapes. The owner is a German, and
our countrymen are funny sometimes.
This one is jolly, with twinkling eyes and
alternate teeth. "Grapes are good money
this year," he says, "but it's a pity the
crop is not heavier. If the frost hadn't
burned so many he would be twice as well
off."
I pointed out that the price might
have been smaller had the crop been
larger, but he doesn't think so. Still the
grapes are good, and from his seventeen
acres, with two pickers, he will clear a
sum which makes his eyes twinkle more
and brings into view his absent teeth.
Following this great load oi grapes into
town, to tne winery there, we may learn
about the fate of those great Clusters of
sweetness. They are dumped into a box,
wherein crawl* an endless chain which
claws them up and up into me separator
at the top of the house. The stems go
down the dump and fail outside, while the
grapes pass into the crusher. The mashed
grapes, skins, saeds and all, are sent down
pipes into the vats. Nice big vats they
are, big enough to keep house in.
This is a good time to learn about differ
ent wines in theory. White wine and iÂ«d
wine are not made from different grapes.
T c? difference lies in the way tney are fer
mented. For claret the wine ferments
skins and all; for white wine the skins
are *aken out before fermentation begins.
The color cotnes lrom the acid uniting
with the dark matter in the skins.
Grapes contain much tariaric acid. Per
haps some housewives ! aye wondered
whence comes the cream tartar used in
making snowy biscuit and puffy cake. It
settles in wine-vats. The acid gathers in
tne bottom and on the sides in i -ystals.
An old vat is coated inches deep with it.
Often, too, some is extracted from the
pomace by pouring a little boiling water
on it. The acid gathers on it like frost on
a window-pane. Nothing is wasted. Ttie
p .mace, mostly seed and fiber, is dried
and used to feed the engine. Ton for ton,
it is as good as coal. This wineryâ one
of many â handles thirty tons of grapes a
day; quite a pile if it were in your front
yard.
The yield around Livermore will exceed
4000 tons and the wine made will equal
500,000 gallons. The price is from $16 to
$25 a ton. That makes a tidy sum of
money.
All over our great State this harvest is
being gathered for wine, for raisins, for
eating; thousands of men, women and
children are making a living working
with them, and immense sums of money
are circulating. It would seem that we
ought to have plenty to eat; but if we
have them we must pay for them. The
crop is not heavy enough to pay for coax
ing the public. Every one can be sold
straig .t from the vineyard. It is a great
industry this year, and the wiseacres do
say that such a year for grapes has not
been seen since the early days. Blessed
ha the man who has grapes to sell, for he
sbail inherit riches even in these times of
Bryanism and politics.
sound of firearms stampedes him and ha
has to be unharnessed and his place taken
by the pa.ient bullocks, who draw the
cannon anywhere on the battle-ground,
apparently oblivious of all danger. Our
illustration shows a heavy battery of the
Indian army on parade. There are four
such batteries in India, each composed of
six heavy guns â 40- pounders and six three
inch nfles â and each gun is drawn by two
elephants. The guns are manned by Eng
lishmen and the officers are English. But
all the transport of the battery is drawn
by bullocks and on the battle-field they
are changed with the elephants. The
picture shows a single division of a bat
tery only. The entire strength is one
major, one captain, three lieutenants, two
sergeants, six corporals, twelve bombar
diers and sevrnty-two gunners, with an
Indian contingent of 163 mahouts, drivers
and servants, etc
An animal little thought of for military
purposes is the domestic, bumble pussy
cat. This will be news to most people,
that puss takes her place among the
animals that all armies require, especially
Sam's; yet so it is. Mice and rats flourish
quite as- weil in Government storehouses
as they do elsewhere â indeed, some peo
ple tnink more so. The services of Tabby
are called into requisition faroftener man
supposed, and without any equivocation
it may be said that Puss is among the
most active of her country's defenders in
her war against that enemy of the entire
human race â the tribe of rats. To wager
ceaseless, war against the vermin of rats
and mice t at infest all Government ware
houses is really a war to Puss, and often
she will be found covered with battle
wounds and scars and worthy to be put on

The letter we publish, below is from one of
the "old guard" of the American Whist League,
and one of the directors of the league. The
club that he is president ot made one of the
best records in whist play of any club belong
ing to the American Whist League. His
modesty prevents us mentioning his name.
He thinks as we do.
He vino writes for whist, and not for fame.

Nevertheless, we feel proud to thinK that
such critics as Trist, Wort, Dray son, Cavendish,
Paine, Miss Wheelock, Briggs, Bunn, ;Mitchelli I
Weems, Leroy Smith, President Barney, Otis,
Kribbf-n and others want to see and read our
articles each week, and to occasionally receive
such letters is certainly very gratifying.

Another use we make of it. In connection will) an

are well aware that many teams always discard
or finally from weakness. a:id others have various
ideas and pans. We always discard from weak
i.mi when trumps are do: declared, or when they
are declared with us. and Just as rigidly discard
irom strength when they arts declared against us,
excert when we want to reverse ihe meaning we
make the signal. f-omeunjes, of course, we do
no: feet a era to compete the reverse, but
when we discard originally a curd as high as an
eight oar partner is 1 arefiil 10 find out wiiemc-r It

and stranger than any othor. in other words, we
believe we can show punnet the condition of
our hand more accurate y an > at the same time
no: weaken It than by any other system we are

Cavendish, the great whist authority, sends
cs a hand at whist that was played a short
time ago in the York Cub of London. â 
In a letter, to our whist editor Cavendish
says:
"I inclose yon a hand as you want it 'so bad.'
I played South. There Is not much in my play,
as the trumps can easily be counted at trick
Vhree. The best point in the hand, I think, is
my partner's discard of : diamonds." :.- â¢- â¢ â  â¢ .â :.
Cavendish further says: â¢â¢Short suitism : and
other fads will die a natural death when people
find they don't pay. There are one or two
plays which, require/ serious consideration,
viz. : the lead from ace and four others (small)
in plain suits, and : the lead from king, jack,
ten and one small. I have discussed these; in
an article in Harper's Weekly for July." Com
mencing on some of our articles in ' relation to
fads he cays:.
"1 don't quite agree with you. about driv
ing; out fads. The world's history shows
that persecution? as ' a role, only makes peo
ple .obstinate.: In ':; my opinion '* the beat
way. to treat fads is to ignore, them. I have
taken this line in American r edition of
Whist. My publishers, ScriDner & 8 nÂ«. had
letters which they ; forwarded to me saying I
am not up to date, as I don't notice thin, that
and the other thing. * In reply I stated ihat I
purposely, omitted fads," without, if they
wished, I would do them . an article on 'Whist

ers as well. Every student of whist should
take a pack of cards deal the hand and study
it. The opening leader makes the conventional
lead from his suit of tour trumps, and at trick
3 how many young j.layers are there with
Sonth's hand who would refrain from putting
up the king?
Aerain, at trick 11, Souths lead of the 7

the purpose of having the lead of clubs come

Comments on the play by the "Master":
Trick Iâ North, having four trumps and
three of each other suit, leads a trump.
Trick aâ North has no better game than to
continue the trump. As he now leads the
seven he nolds two higher. East, playing the
five, may be read with the knave single.
Therefore North's remaining trumps are nine,
eight, and the seven is a sure trick-winnÂ«r.
Consequently South passes.
Trick 4â North rises to the sitnstion. Unless
East is playing the giddy goat with king, jack,
of trumps South has the king.
Trick 6â Sooth can count bis partner with
the last trump. He therefore leads a small
heart from ace, queen, six in suit. A* it hap
pens it makes no difference whether touih
leads are or tmall.
Trick 8 and 9. North's discard of guarded
knave of diamonds Is gooa, as the winning
diamond is certainly against him.

I Trick 11â South plays' to put'the "leKd in
: North's hand, that he â¢ may lead ; clubs. ' If
I South, here, leads a club, "because you dis
i carded diamond partner," he loses a trick, as
! the cards happen to lie. Moreover, it is a
j mornl certainty that West does not hold king
of clubs, as he can be; counted 'with; two dia
monds and one club. If he bad king of clubs
be would have discarded another diamond to
keep the king of clubs guarded.
V, Note â If the trumps are drawn, no play can
prevent South'* bringing in â  the hearts. , But
if, at , trick 3, South plays carelessly and puts
on king of spades, he loses Two tricks. East
will then make Jack of spades ana. (if he re
turns a diamond) West â  will make, queen of
diamonds.

Mr. Otis shows excellent Judgment and
good common-sense in keeping his whist
readers out of deep water. If all writers

Charles E. Coffin, the author of "The Gist of
Whist," has just returned from a summer trip
to Europe. Mr. Coffin not only writes whistâ
and writes it so plain that beginners should*
all read his bookâ but he rides a wheel. In
this way he traveled over a thousand miles in
England and on the Continent. Mr. Coffin, in
writing to the whist editor, says many things
about whist in Indianapolis, and winds up
by saying the queen, Miss Ktte Wheelock,
comes October 1 for tte month; Uien whist
will boom.

BRA>CUSIORK-74 â¢ aid y 4 i Markets*A CLERICAL ROBE THAT COVERS CHECK TROUSERS
San Francisco has been treated to a sin
gular spectacle during the past week. An
ignorant man came to the City wearing a
long, flowing black robe over and conceal
ing a light check pair of trousers. His
hair and beard were worn in the fashion
that picture-makers have given to Jesus
Christ. He took up his abode at a cheap
Kearny-street hotel, and immediately the
street in front of it began to till up with
people who sought to have him bless
them and cure their ills. No credentials
were asked of him. His assumption oi
the likeness of "the Savior of the world"
was not deemed a sacrilege. The fact that
any man who chose to "make himself !
up"â allow his hair to crow, trim his I
beard and put on the simple robe such as
worn by the Nazarene â could wear some- |
thing of his likeness was not considered.
Nor was the fact considered that just
beneath that single black robe was a pair
of very light check trousers, such as is seen
oftenest on the Bowery. Certainly divin
ity has limited its gifts to this man to that
of healing. It has withheld from him the
gift of speech and of good taste.
AEROCYCLE INVENTED BY TWO PORTLAND LAWYERS
Two young attorneys of Portland, Or. â
T. A. Marquam and H. C. Robertson â
during the present lull in business pend
ing the election of McKinley and Hobart,
have invented a new aerocycle. This is a
flying machine containing an aluminum
gas tank and propelled by pedal power.
There are many excellent points about
their invention, and several experts who
have examined the drawings and speci
fications declare that the machine is en
tirely practical.
The inventors describe their aerocycle
as follows: "It has a gas cylinder holding
10,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas, which
has a lifting power of 70 pounds to the
1000 cubic feet, giving us a lifting power of
700 pounds. The entire machine is to be
constructed of aluminnm. The gas cylin
der is to be revolved by tbe tandem cycle
hanging beneath it, or by a small gas en
gine. We can get a Kane-Pennington en
gine weighing only fifty pounds that will
develop four horsepower.
"The gas cylinder carries a double vane,
which we calculate at 100 revolutions per
minute will drive the cycle through the
air at the rate of thirty-nine miles an
hour. Beneath tbe cylinder and just
bove the tandem is a horizontal fan,
which will remain stationary except when
descending, and is to be used to alight
with and also to steady the aer,ocycle in
ascending.
FROM LONE BEGGAR BOY TO GLITTERING BELLE
"Yes; I've had many a queer experience I
in my time right here along Montgomery
street, but T can tell you about one in par
ticular that's stranger than fiction. Talk
of dramas, if it couid only be put upon
the stage as I saw it, as it all happened,
with the lamplight and the different
scenes, the theater would be full forever. "
Special Police Officer Fields, who looks
alter things on Montgomery street, be
tween Market and California, was
full of his remarkable reminiscences. He
was one of a little group opposite the Oc
cidental Hotel entrance, and each man
had a story to tell. Being policemen their
different narratives of something striking
in their experience of San Francisco's
streets were sure to be interesting, which
indeed they were; but for dramatic and
picturesque qualities Orhcer Fields' yarn
was one out of a thousand, even of these
plain, unvarnished tales. He continued
with his story:
"One night I was on Montgomery street,
pretty near the Russ House door, when a
young fellow came up to me and asked for
help. That was some years ago, before the
streets came to be infested with 'strikers.'
"I looked the young fellow all overâ you
know how a man in my business gets into

NesÂ§ avenue. Mme.- Zifferer has
just returned from a European trip and her
many friends took advantage of this occasion
to bid her " welcome home."
The parlors of the Ziska residence are so
pretty of themselves that but little decoration
is needed. The decorators recognized th<s fact
and used only vases and bowls of choice cut
L, Sowers to lend to the apartments a festive ap
pearance.
During the evening there were a number of
excellent musical selections. Mme. Zifferer

ments had been served and a few hours of

excellent way, George Lawson, on behalf of his
fellow workmen, presented the handsome gift
in a neat and kindly speech.

If there be anything in the faith cureâ
and every physician readily asserts that
there is in certain classes of cases â then
many apparent cures might result among
the throng that goes to this man's shrine
juat as the same may follow and does fol
low a visit to a Chinese joss in proper
Bpirit. For a watcher at the line that
passes under nis bands must be amazed at
the pallor, the awe, the trembling with
which they draw near tnis man with the
black robe concealing tbe check pants.
Mothers teach their children to kneel
when in their turn in the line they reach
him. An old lady last evening brought
her handbag full of handkerchiefs and
"bits of ribbon," which she asked him to
bless, so that she might send them to her
friends. She said she thought it would be
"easier for him." He said "Of course,"
opened the bag and breathed into it and
then held the whole thing up between his
hands with that rapt expression that is
supposed to do the business. But the old
lady was not satisfied with that She asked
him to "bless her," so that she might
have powar to bless others and cure them.
"The tail or rudder is a double vane, one
resting horizontal and the other vertical,
and is to be hung on a universal joint and
will control the motion both vertically
and horizontally.
"On the flagstaff a parachute will be car
ried always, folded so as to offer as little
resistance as possible, but to be immedi
ately opened and ready for duty in case of
any accident to the gas chamber. We
claim that the whole machine will weigh
but 2-59 pounds and will easily carry two
or three men."
Six men and a flying machine, hidden
among the sand mountains of Indiana at
the southern end of Lake Michigan, are
patiently waiting for a favoraDle wind,
that they may astonish the scientific
world by an aerial flight. The most hope-
fal man in the party is the inventor. He
will be the solitary passenger in the aerial
beat when it. shoots off its lauching ways
and starts on its soaring voyage acro.-s the
lake. He is William Paul, a Russian by
a habit of studying a man's appearance.
Well, there was something in that young
fellow, and the funniest part of it was I
was completely at sea. It might have
been, I thought on first impression, it
might have been be was an innocent, run
away boy who belonged to good people.
Anyhow, he puzzled me. I said nothing,
but thought a lot, while I tried hard to
make out wnat kind of a fellow he was.
'If you please, sir,' he said to me, 'l'm
hungry and have no money, nor a place to
sleep. Can you help me?' He spoke so
nicely, too, that I said to myself, "This boy
has something good in bin.'
" 'Where did yon come from?' I said to
him.
" 'I came from the country to look for
work in San Francisco and have been dis
appointed.'
â¢â¢ 'Got any folks V
" 'Yes, sir.' tne boy replied, and he
looked at me with an appealing look. 'I
ran away from home.'
"He told me that the last work he had
done was washing dishes in a restaurant in
the City, and he had scalded bis arm terri
bly Dy accidentally turning on the boiling
water. His arm was in a sling, and I could
see that it had been treated by a surgeon
street. The evening was pleasantly passed
with music and dancing. Among those pres
ent were: Mr. and Mrs. John Lynott, Mr. and
Mrs. M. Gilligan, Mrs. Martin Lynotc, Mrs. M.

The twentieth anniversary of the birth of
Thomas J. Healey of 3380 Twenty-third street,

GRAND TRUSTEE BANQUET.
El Dorado Parlor No. 52, N. & G. W., ten-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
Tbis was too much even for the divine
healer. He drew a long breath and de
clared that he could not confer a power
like that upon any one. That came from
God direct. "You must be born with thÂ«
power to heal," ne said.
"Then you think that it is not my mis
sion?" asked the unhappy woman â un
happy in spite of the bagful of handker
chiefs and ribbons.
"No, it cannot be, unless you were born
to it," and he glanced at her gray hairs,
as if to emphasize the hopelessness of her
case.
"Then tell me what is my mission?"
she asked eagerly.
Ah, tbis was drawing npon powers
that the healer had not been born with
nor had since cultivated. In the matter
of standing with uplifted eyes, as he had
seen Christ do in the pictures, he was all
right â that was comparatively easy. He
hesitated an instant, and then stumblingly
repeated a platitude, "Your mission is to
show the way of light, teach about God â I
â¢would talk to you, but there are a great
many waiting to ste me, you see."
birth, a Chicagoan by adoption. He calls
his flyine machine the Albatross.
It consists of a boat frame nineteen feet
Jong and six feet wide at the upper ribs,
which Mr. Paul contemplates covering
with strong oilcloth, so as to transform it
into a veritable boat. Above this are
what he calls the keels, or three balance
tunnels, occupying a width of eieht feet,
the way it was bandaged.
" 'Come with me,' I said; 'I'll fix yon
out for tne night, but you'll have to go
home to your folks to-morrow. This is no
place for a boy like you.'
"Then he looked at me again with the
same appealing look, arid I started to think
again about this boy ; he was so much out
of place. I tried all tne restaurants round
two blocks, but they were closed, and then
I took him up to the Russ House dining
room. When he sat down to the table I
was struck by the pretty head of short
curly hair he bad and his handsome face.
I ran my band through his hair. 'That's
a nice head of hair you have,' I remarked.
But he only looked at me again, tbe same
as before, and every time he 'stumped
me. I took him around on Bush street to
get him a bed for the night, for by this
time I'd taken quite an interest in the boy
and was curious to know who he was. The
iandlady of tbe Elmer House was at the
door on Bush street, and as I passed she
called me aside. Now it is wonderful how
quick a woman is in seeing things that a
man would never notice.
" ' Mr. Fields,' she said to me, ' that's a
girl that's witc you!'
"I laughed at her.
dered a banquet at Union-square Hall 'Thurs
day night to F. Sabachi of Los Angeles. The
guest of the evening holds the honored
position of grand trustee of the order. Covers
were laid for sixty-five, and a jollier crowd
never gathered around a banquet board. The
following toasts were drunk and responded to:
"Future of the Order," Grand Secretary Lun

Dr. W. J. Hftwkins; "Native Daughters," E. N.

One of the public schools of Germany,
the Nau-Ruppin Gymnasium, bas made it
obligatory on ail its pupils to learn to ride
the bicycle.
Schrader has a mild manner and expres
sion and voice that are well in keeping
with his profession of power. But in
nearly all else he fails. His surroundings
and methods are vulgar to the last degree,
and stamp him as a faker and mounte
bank, who is blessing the people for what
there is in it. He bas a bagful of photo
graphs, which represent him in attitudes
which have been loaned by familiar prints
to Christ.
One bas him expounding the Scriptures,
a large book upon his left arm, his right
hand pointing to heaven. Another has
him blessing little children, and another
with both arms outstretched and eyes
cast upward in the attitude of prayer.
The people who come for a blessing were
by this divine healer banded over to a
man who has these pictures for sale. He
is a big man, with a threatening scowl
upon his face and a chew of tobacco
in his mouth, and it is with slight indul
gence that he listens to the occasional
wnisper: "I will come to-morrow for a
picture; I brought no change along."
This fellow professes to have been a news
tbe central space or tunnel being left
open at the top, while the two side spaces
are roofed. Above tnis, again, are the
wings, seven ieet broad and forty feet in
length from tip to tip. These are shaped
like the wings of the albatross, being sin
uous in front and of varying concavity
from the front to the rear.
Above the wings in the center is fixed
an adjustable plane, tbe angle of which
may be varied during flight, so an to bal
ance the machine at various rates of speed.
Back of the body of the boat is placed an
adjustable tail, which also serves to regu
late the angles of flight. Above this tail
there is a vertical rudder, moved by light
lines leading to the hands of the operator,
so as to direct the course to the right or
left.
This Paul machine, under its present di
mensions, weighs nearly 200 pounds, and
spreads to tbe wind 266 square feet of sail
surface in wings, keels and plane. It is
"Well, I determined to investigate, but,
anyhow, I felt for the boyâ or girlâ and
said 1 would not ask any questions till
next morning. 1 got him a bed in the
Russ house, and gave him some small
change, so that in case I would not see
him again he would not be hungry next
day. From his dress I saw he was a poor
country boy, although his face and de
meanor made me believe he was the young
son of Borne gentleman. I told him to
meet me about 6 o'clock in "the morning,
and 1 would advise him what to do. He
promised to De up at 6, and to wait for me
on my beat. But instead he gut up earlier
and disappeared- Evidently he wanted to
avoid me.
"About a year later I was on my beat in
front of tbe Lick House about 11 or 12
o'clock at night, when a hack drove up to
the hotel. I saw an old gentlemanâ a dis
tinguished appearing old man, dressed in
a Prince Albert suit and wearing a stylish
silk hat. As be stepped to the sidewalk
he turned round and helped a beautifully
dressed young lady to alight. Evidently
they had been at the theater or a society
ball, for she was dressed for something of
the soit, with silks and satins and dia
monds and wrapB â you know how wealthy
PLUCKING TO MUSIC
THE sailor has his musical shanty to
which he keeps time as he trots
about the capstan until the anchor ia
hoisted to the peak, the farmer trills a lay
to lighten his labors as he pitches hay into
the wagon, and these songs are familiar to
many, but who ever heard or saw a gang
of Italian chicKen-pickerssing and denude
fowls to the tune of the music?
Such a scene can be witnessed any Fri
day evening at the Clay-street market
while the employes of the big poultry
houses that have their places of business
there are preparing for sale the chickens
that the housewife buys for the Sunday
dinner.
Tbe men seat themselves in a half circle
and each takes a fowl. One stroke of a
sharp knife across , the throat puts
the unfortunate squawking broiler
out of its misery,* and then the
foreman of the gang starts his song. As
they catch the air and the time the others
chime in and in an instant the plucking
begins. With rhythmic motion the nim
ble fingers grasp the feathers and pull
them out during all the time of the song.
Feathers fly in all directions, but the
song goes on nntil the last pin-feathers
are removed and the carcasses are tossed
into a pile, ready for the man who puts on
the finishing touches and prepares them
for the inspection of prospective purchas
ers.
The rapidity with which a chicken is
stripped of its feathers is astonishing to
the unitiated who has tried it but a few
times, and so adept have these men be
come that they finish their fowls aimost
simultaneously, and the process Is re
peated in unison. Three dozen birds is
not considered a heavy night's work for
one man, and when pressed for time they
manage to compass even more than that.
The song they sing is remarkably lively
and sweet, and mac I resembles the song
of the fishermen as they row their boats,
though the time is much faster.
Throne-Kooin of the Sultan.
The gilding in the throne- room of the
Sultan of Constantinople is unequaled by
any other building in Europe, and from
the ceiling hangs a superb Venetian
chandelier, the 200 lights of which make a
I
paper man, but if he writes with the same
utter disregard for rules of Enelish with
which he talks his newspaper career must
have been short.
In private these two talk to each other
on the familiar footing of Bhow people.
The photograph salesman directs the
divine healer what to do in the brusque
language of a stage director and the divine
healer follows the directions. The agent
talks of "our successes" here and there,
the big crowds that came to see us in Cin
cinnati and Tennessee and Mexico; of the
railroad excursions that were run to carry
the crowds in Texas. He explains that
but for him tbe divine healer would not
be able to pay expenses or that "strangers
would take hold of the thing and make
more of a business affair out of it than it
is." There had been others before nim,
he said, and he knew.
One of the properties which these peo
ple carry with them is a picture of
Schrader's mother, which he says many
people have told nim is "another Virgin
Mary." The picture is that of a stout,
comfortable housewife.

estimated that it will raise more than a
pound to every square foot of sail surface,
or some 350 pounds, in a good strong wind.
In consequence of its great dimensions it
cannot be carried and launched by the
operator, but requires special appliances
to get it afloat in the air. These have been
provided by building a trestlework on the
side of a high hill facing the lake, the top
of this trestie being ninety-two feet above
the water, with an intervening beach about
400 feet wide.
It is intended that the machine shall
get under way by gliding down the incline
forward by this trestle and soaring out
toward the lake. For this purpose a wind
is required blowing from the north with a
velocity of about fifteen miles an hour!
and, unfortunately, since the machine
was completed and put together ready for
flight, th re have been but two occasions
upon which such a wind prevailed.
On the first oi these occasions the ma
chine was put into the trestle or launch
ing ways, run out to the free end, and
Mr. Paul, the inventor, who weighs 130
pounds, placed himself in the boat.
Ropes were attached to the machine, and
it was suffered to rise about iy t feet above
the launching ways. Mr. Paul demon
strated that under those conditions he
had apparently complete control over the
equilibrium of the machine; that by step
ping backward the front would rise so as
to get greater lifting power from the
wind, and by stepping forward the ma
chine would oscillate back.
ladies dress for the theater.
"She toot the old gentleman's arms,
and their eyes happened to glance in my
direction. I saw that she started, but re
covered herself instantly. 'Where did I
see that face before?' I asked myself. It
was firmly impressed on my memory, but
for the life of me I could not place it any
where. AnH I fell into a brown study
over it. The next thine I knew, a lady
with a white fur wrap over her head came
running toward me, a minute or two later,
when I had walked near to Sutter street.
She stopped in front of me, and I began
to wonder what was comine.
" 'Don't you remember me?' the young
lady said.
" 'I'm sorry I can't, madam,' I said,
'though your face is familiar.'
" 'Don't yon remember the boy you be
friended. You liked bis curly hair.'
" 'Oh, yes; yes, now I recollect.'
" 'Well, I was that boy,' she said. 'I took
your advice and returned home, and now
how can I repay you ?'
"She held my hand, and wan as glad to
see me as if I was her father. I learned
afterward that she was a member of one
of tbe best families of California, bnt her
name is my secret."

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersej
Election November 3, JS96.
Maintain tne Republican party.
There is always harmony in regularity.
Loyal Republicans should read the riot
act to the wranslers.^
Now is the time for bolting Republicans
to come back and be forsiven.
The shadow ot Rainey fmlh on the Phe
lan ticket like a bucketful of tax.
The demand of Republicans is for peace
in the party aad war against the enemy.
This is to be a Republican year in San
Francisco as well as in the rest of the
country.
Party government by State central com
m ttees i? universal in American politics.
Why violate the Rtlet
'I am in favor of the American pay
roll," says McKinley. How is that for a
sound- luoncv platform?
Buckley doubtless thought tbe tail ol
the Populist would bo witu the hide, but
Bainey got away wltfc it.
The. threat of free silver c'.osed the fac
tories, and a threst of free silver mono
metallism won't open them.
If the Republican party is to remain a
iÂ«elf-goverrtirig body it must respect the
authority which itself has constituted.
Don't forget that the men who are most
pager to continue the dissension? in the
KepubhcJan party are Rainey and Buckley.
Now that Buckley and Rainey have
fallen out, the people have only to unite
on Colonel Taylor to make them stay out
The interior mar rest satisfied now that
San* Francisco will do her share toward
carrying California for McKinley and Ho
bart.
According to the record there are seven
Presidential tickets in the field, but ac
cording to the outloot there is only one
in it.
It is conceded that Cator is a conun
drum to the Democrats, but it is not cer
tain ye: whether they will give him up or
try to answer tim.
Boston nas a poet whose verses are said
to speak volumes, and yet the Herald of
that city declares the volumes ought to be
suppressed if published.
Among the questions to be answered by
every citiien in this campaign are: What
did I lose by the Me Kiniey tariff ? What
did I gain by the Wilson tariff?
The Republican ticket is the only local
ticket in San Francisco that is straight
If yon do not vote that you must go
crooked without knowing where you will

Every Republican can assist in estab
lishing party harmony by putting himself
into harmony with the party organization
and opposing bolters at every turn of the
road.
If any one has ever had hopes of the elec
tion of Palmer and Bucxner toey may as
well abandon them now. Tariff-bill Wi',.
sea is going to take the stump for that
tlektt.
Once more it has been demonstrated to
the people that Republicans know how to
unite for great principles, while Demo
crats can only quarrel over the spoils they
hope to win.
By the nomination of a legislative ticket
non-partisanship has been' reduced * to' a
political absurdity. Imagine a legislator
casting a non-partisan vote for United
States Senator.
If the proposed new charter is adopted
we shall need a man of the stanchest in
tegrity in the Mayor's office, aad for
tunately we have sach a candidate in
Charles L. Taylor.
Bryanisni is hardly anything more than
an attempt to reduce National polities to
sectionalism and to substitute for the uni

class clamoring aeainst anot. er.
Democratic candidates for the Legisla

they intend, if elected, to rote for Cator

THE ELEVATION OF JOURNALISM.
Whon W. It. Hearst emerged from the
classic shades of Harvard Collie and the
gentle Joys of dalliance to engage in jour
nalism there was much hopeful expecta
tion indulged in by those who had lofty
ideas of the American newspaper and of
ite possible elevation. It would have
been a high and noble ambition in Mr.
Hearst to attempt the realization of these
hopes by lifting the paper which had been
purchased for him out of the depths of its
past unworth ana placing it upon a pedes
tal of merit, virtue, honor and repute be
yond suspicion and worthy of public con
fidence and praise.
The young man entered upon his career
as a journalist with every imaginable ad
vantage. He had wealth, education, a
good presence, popularity and an honored
name. No man ever had a better oppor
tunity to lift journalism to a higher level
and to keep it there without descending to
the ignoble policies, the degrading meth
ods and the slavish expedients which
those of low instincts and limited means
have too frequently been tempted to em
ploy. He could have repented and im
proved in fc>an Francisco the career of
George W. Childsof Philadelphia or Elliot
F. Shepard of New York.
Instead he chose to wallow with In
creasing frequency and desire in tbe
filthiest poo's which the bops and fens of
aiodern journalism afford. He endeavored
to build up tbe power and intiuence of
his paper by methods which would have
disgraced the most uncouscionable fraud
and faker who haunts the entrance tc a
country fair. He has been utterly re
gardless of the yesterdays and to-morrows
of a liewspaper, and has counted the
friendships, the duties and tbe principles
of either as nothing compared with the
sensations of to-day. In the same issue,
ana even sometimes upon the same page,
his paper has paraded its owner's
hypocrisy in mingled praise and blame of
vico or virtue, according to tlie passing
whim of the hour. By partnerships in
lotteries or worse; by purcnased con
nivance at frauds and swindles in public
and private service; by paid complacence
in the presence of political infamies; by
unblushing encouragement and advocacy
of all that is false and hollow in daily life,
and of every sham and folly which have
for their purpose the pollution of the
human mind; by the ridicule of every
aspiration and effort for the betterment of
society ; by daring endeavors at the levy
of black mail upon public official?, and by
successful and self-confessed extortion
practiced upon private corporations, it has
made itself feared as well as hated by
every lover of truth, honesty and decency
in the land.
A man who has inherited wealth and
has acquired power by such disreputable
means sometimes cherishes the aspira
tion to wash up and be a gentleman. Tne
owner of the Examiner has never indulged
in this laudable desire and may be ex
cused therefor, since an inspection of the
files of his newspaper would impress any
sane-minded person with the utter hope
lessness of the task. It has been left to
this willing exponent and organizer of all
that is base and ignoble in modern jour
nalism to amply deserve M:u*au!ay's fa
mous castration o* Barrere, "Whatsoever
things are false, whatsoever things are
dishonest, whatsoever tuings are unjust,
whatsoever things are impure, whatsoever
things are hateful, whatsoever things are
of evil report, if there be any vice, if there
be any infamy" â all of these things are
blended in this the most shameless and
abandoned bawd and pander among the
newspapers of to-day.
There was not much the matter with this
country in lS9t, was there? There was not
much the matter with this country from 1879
until IS9S either. Bid ' you hear, from
IST9 to 182!, anything in regard to the deple
tion of the gold reserve? Did you hear any
Republican anywhere alleging that we ought
to borrow money f What was the matter. with
the treasury of the United Stales under the
Republican administration ending with Ben
jamin Harrison? Nothing whatever. Hon.

THE NON-PARTISAN JOKE.
There are UJMttteg incidents in every
political campaign, and some incidents are
more amusing than others, btlt nothing
could be more amusincr than a Non-
Partisan convention taking great care to
Stride nominations equally betwesn two
bitterly opposed parties. A Xon-Partisan
convention has been iv operatiou for some
days in this City and County, and it has
made vary many nominations. The labors
of the convention are now ended, however,
and its work is before the people.
The amusing feature of the affair is
that the nominees for the Legislature
were made with the view of having a sharp
division on political lines on tbe question
of selecting a United States Senator, and
the funniest thing about U is that Demo
crats are invited to vote for Republican
legislators who would suffer their rigat
arm to be cut otf before they would help
elect a Democratic United States Senator,
and Republicans ore asked to vote for
Democratic legislators who would rather
be fed to the fish in the bay than be the
means of letting a Republican go to the
Senate.
In fact the Non- Partisan legislative
ticket is a most intensely partisan ticket,
only that the plan is to have Democrats
vote for Republicans and Republicans
vote for Democrats. Just what would be
gained by such a representation in the
Legislature does not appear, but it is safe
to say that should the ticket be elected
each legislator wouid make naÂ«te to get
into the camp of his own party. - The next
Legislature is bound to be a very partisan
body. A United States Senator is to be
elected. He wili be a protectionist or a
free-trader and party lines will be drawn
sharp and fine, as they should be, and no
Republican should have his hands tied
or be committed to be "non-partisan."
California needs to have a good working
majority of partisan Republicans in the
next Legislature.

GATOR-BUCKLEY-WRITE.
Thia is the political cheese-sandwich
presented by thePopocraUof California to
its honest citizens for digestion on elec
tion day. The collusion between Cator
and White, in their mutual aspiration for
the senatorship, has for its limbarger cen
ter the malodorous Buckley, who is ex
pected to give strength to the combination
which eTsry one concede* to have been
made. Tbe strength which the presence
of Buckley wiil add is of that dov
character common to such mixtures and
it will probably cause the people of Cali
fornia to spew the whole aggregation out
ot their mouths.
Those Democrats vho respect their party
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
and are trying to keep it true to itself have
for some time been making wry faces at
the idea of accepting Cator as their candi
date for Senator. This objection has not
been confined to any single section nor to
any particular kind of Democrats. It has
come from the whole body of the party, to
whom the very name of Cator has been an
abhorrence for several years. Even the
earnest desire of the Bryan element to se
cure the electoral vote of California for
the latter cannot reconcile them to the
idea of surrendering to an ultra-Populist
like Cator the highest and mot>t honor
able office within the gift of a State.
It is from Southern California, however,
that the first formally expressed protest
has arisen. It comes from the home of
Senator White and is voiced by those who
have heretofore been his adherents and
friends. It calls upon him to abandon the
iniquitous bargain between nimself and
Cator, and demands, if he will not, that
the Democratic State Central Committee
shall require his resignation. In unmeas
ured terms it denounces Cator as "a Pop
ulist, a sooialist, a nationalist, a revolu
tionist, or anything else to get into the
United States Senate," and charges Sena
tor White with treason to his party in
making such an unholy alliance to further
his own political ends.
The episode which has just ended ln tne
control of the local Populist convention
by Buckley should cause the Los' Angeles
protest to become State-wide in its adop
tion by the Democratic party. How can
its self-respecting members reconcile
themselves to the humiliating necessity
of concealing from their noses the odor of
the sandwich which is being thrust down
their throats?
We want no idle men in the United States,
and to the end that ice may have neither idle
miil-i nor idle vien tee must do our work in
the United States, and not outside the United
Blatts. You may disagree with me, but 1 be
lieve in a protective tariff. I have altcays so
believed and J have never felt called upon to
make any apology to anybody anywhere for
having been devoted to the great principle
which promotes and encourages American de
velopment and gives employment and good
wages to American work ing men. â McKinley.
BRYAN'S FALLACIES.
Mr. Bryan assures the people that "in
case we have free coinage all our citizens
may take their silver to the mints and
have it coined into dollars." but he fails
to suggest how or where the people will
find siiver to have coined into dollars.
Were he to say those who are lucky
enough to own silver mines could, under
free coinage, take 53 cents' worth of the
products of their hills to the mints and
have it stamped and made a le.jal tender
for 100 cents the people would know what
he meant, but the way be put the propo
sition the impression is made that either
he thinks the people are fools or he him
self is a trifle daft.
Not one quarter of 1 per cent of the peo
ple have silver, and hence less than one
quarter of 1 per cent of the people would
be benefited directly by Iree coinage. Of
course Mr. Bryan would say to this that
free coinage would make silver dollars
plenty because of the great rush of silver
bullion to the mints (or coinage, but even
so, how would those who have no silver
ouliion get hold of the mints' output of
dollars unless they had something to ex
change for them? Free distribution of
dollars is not contemplated, as we under
stand Mr. Bryan, hence those who wanted
silver dollars would have to give some
thing that would be their equivalent.
But it so happens that all of the people
are employers or employes â that is,
payers or payees of wagesâ and in or
der to put dollars into the pocket of tbe
employe the employer must be able to sell
the product of his employe's labor. For
three years there has been no market for
the product of American iabor because
B-yan's kind of a tariff law has been in
force, which enables foreign labor to sup
ply our markets with its products. As
suming, then, that all the silvfk- is in dol
lars, would our idle workingruen get them
or wouid the foreign labor that is manu
facturing our goods an J wares for us get
them? Mr. Brysn should explain this
iestture of his philosophy.
The fact is, no benefit would accru* to
American labor, nor to any other class of
people, if silver dollars were piled moun
tain higii if they could not be reached
through the channels of employment,
wage-earning and markets. Admitting
that our mints should be thrown open to
silver, would that prevent foreigners con
trolling our merchandise markets? And
if it did not, how would the dollars thus
coined roach our people? It is an eco
nomic fact that if all the money in the
world were piled upon our shores we
could get none of it until we made some
thing to exchange for it. But exteud to our
industries proper protection, so that they
may give labor all the work it wants at
good wages, then the people will have
plenty of merchantable thing?, including
labor, to exchange for dollars. Mr. Bryan
always gets tbe cart before the horse.

ONE MONTH FROM TO-DAY.
One month from to-day tne people will
â¢wake to know that McKinley and Hobart
have been elected. Over the country for
four years the heavy clouds of depression
and disaster haw bang. On the edges of
tnes? retreating clouds tne Republican
victory will shine like a rainbow of
prom is* overarching the land. There will
be a new brightness in the eyes of all and
a gladness in all hearts. The dawn of bet
ter times will be at hand. The welfare of
the people so long threatened will have
been redeemed ana renewed.
We may to some extent 'this morning
anticipate the gladness Tof that day. This
morning which brings ns rest and leisure
may well : bring us also the ; consciousness)
of approaching prosperity.^ It is permis
sible to rejoice already ia i the good that is
sure to come. Let us ' therefore enjoy to
day and recreate ourselves for the work of
the coming week.
L\Oa^ every; side are omens favorable for
ourselves and oar , neighbors. Gold is
coming into the country from both sides.
It comes from Europe; to York and
from Australia ato \ Saa i Francisco. v The
price of wheat is rising, the price' of fruit
has an upward impulse, the real estate
market is improving and in all â  its thou
sand channels business begins to feel the
effects of the incoming tide of a revived
'pjosperityVf^^^^^i r s .-. *
â¢^lt.is not easy.to estimate the extent of
the benefits California' will derive from the
coming change. In contrast with the
"misfortunes " of the ; past ; four I years they,
will ;' be great v indeed. We may ; look * for
activity in all lines of trade. We maj
look for new industries of many kinds.
The re-establishment of the protective
system will afford opportunities for the
development of all our resources, and no
man can fix the limits of the profits we
will derive from them.
One month from to-day what is now a
hope will have become a realization. The
election of McKinley, now assured, will
then be a fact. There will be no longer
any doubts and hesitations about the un
dertaking of new enterprises, the expan
sion of existing industries. Labor will find
employment, trade will find a profit.
American energy, freed from the compe
tition of foreign cheap labor, will go for
ward in the work of building up America
into that mighty and marvelous common
wealth that is to be.
All human good, however, is dependent
on human effort. What we would have
we must work for. Labor and capital alise
are subject to that law. If we would real
ize the prosperity we now anticipate we
must be earnest in striving: for It. We
must work together like true patriots dur
ing the campaign. We must help to elect
McKinley and Hobart if we would rejoice
one month from to-day.

Letters From the People.
NOT FOR FREE SILVER.
The Correction of a False Report Made
by the Examiner.
Editor BMb A late number of the Examiner
contained a notice that Dr. Hutchins had ad
dressed a club favorably on the free coinage of
silver. Many ot my iriends have demanded of
me It I was two-faced. I wish to correct any
such sentiment. In my life I have done many,
many things for which I have "kicked" my
self, and when alone have called myself the
moat unmitigated ass alive; but I have never
been frnllty of the lunacy- of supporting this
sublime fatuity, the free coinage of silver, nor
this howling braggart who tramps around tbe
country singing his one-stringed song and tm-
BsjiM* himself a second edition of Abraham
Lincoln.
I would have sent this to the Examiner but
for the fact that i: refused to publish some
questions that I asked of one of those liars who
brag so mucn about the amazing prosperity oi

ENEMY TO
PROSPERITY
Fifteen of the Many Reasons
That May Be Given
for Opposing
16 to I.
In the New York Sun of September 21
James D. Smith, ex-president of the New
York Stock Exchange gives the following
fifteen reasons for opposing 16 to 1:
Firstâ Because man is finite. He cannot re
peal natural laws, nor perform miracles, even
though clothed with power to legislate.
Secondâ Because falsehood, though expressed
on silver and in raised letters, is falsehood
still.
Thirdâ Because It would be the instrument
of fraud. Those who vote to legalize fraud
are the accomplices of those who commit
fraud.
Four thâ Because It would occasion a great
and sudden change In all nominal values, aud '
deprive the people of the power to enforce an
equitable adjustment of the most ordinary ob
ligations.
Fifthâ Because It would create such con
fusion In every industry as to materially les
sen opportunity for those who toil, and so in
flict great injury vpon the home market for
our products. Most men must earn money be
fore they can buy food or clothing.
Sixth â Because wo are more in need of ac
tivity lv the money we have than we are in
need of more money. Money is never made
active by lessening the employment of labor.
Tho dollar earned and used may reach any
pocket. Hoarded dollars benefit no one.
when "the money power" is assailed with un
scrupulous vituperation it is wellito remem
ber that money nas power to Deeonfe inactive,
power to hide. It socks refuge in dangers of
lar less magnitude than those it would see in
free coinage. It is not coinage, but confidence,
that will make money active.
Seventh â Because we need good foreign
markets for our surplus products. There may
be some imaginary patriotism in talk about
twisting the British lion's tail, but if we twist
it off we will get little from the British but
the tail. We need something of greater value.
It is not "a new declaration of independence"
that we need, but a continuance and an en
largement of tnat interdependence that has
made England rely upon us for many of our
products and us rely upon England for the
millions of money she has been sending us
yearly In exchange therefor.
Eighthâ Because it would weaken a chief
foundation of national life â the right to pos
sess and to safeguard property. Take that
right, away and we should be in a chaos of
conflicting passions, and 110 interest would be
safe.
Ninthâ Because many of those who desire to
cut lOOcent dollars in two would like to do
the same with 50-centor 10-cent dollars. They
care nothing for silver, but are more than will
ing to take any path that will lead them to
ward that valueless, irredeemable pacer money
which they have long craved.
Tenthâ Because the quacks in finance who
favor i t propose to inject into the body politic
more than three hundred times as many silver
dollars as it was able 10 absorb when there
was no restraint upon their use. An ovÂ«rdose
is more likely to aggravate ihan to relieve.
Eleventhâ Because we need botn credit and
security. The advocates of free coinage favor
the prohibition ol contracts that define the
value of the dollars with which debt shall be
paid. When men are prohibited from giving
full security they will be prevented irom get
ting credit.
Twelfth â Because its advocates sees for
power to injure the most effective instruments
we use â the banks that give money wide and
safe distribution, and the railroads that do our
transportation at excessively low rates. It i 3
not the crippled baut that gives the people lib
eral accommodation, or the crippled railroad
that gives them the most satisfactory service.
Thirteenthâ Because those who ask for power
to debase our mon*Â»y ask also for power to tate
from onr mails and our property in transit the
protection oi Federal law. When that is with
drawn and mobs ere not restrained we shall
cease to be a Nation.
Fourteenthâ Because we need to dwell to
gether in unity. Tue silver lsaders are seek
ing to set against each other capital and labor,
producer and consumer, borrower and lender,
hoping to win power through the hatred they
incite; and they are not hampered by facts or
by common-sense In their efforts to stir up
strife. Although they hope to delude some
honest men with their sopnistries, their main
reliance is not upon honesty or intelligence,
bat upon the dishonest, the ignorant, the
shiftless and the vicious. Tne best mea in
both of the great parties are earnestly in oppo

RIGHT AND EXPEDIENCY
OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
The principle of equal rights, the keynote of
American civilization, is the pivot on which
the wnole question of the enfranchisement of
women turns. Here our argument Is grounded
on a rock. The Declaration of Independence
declares that "all men are created equal";
equal, not in capacities, but in rights. It
must be conceded by all that the word "men"
here includes both sexes. These words of
Jefferson but echo the voice of progres
sive humanity. This equality of rights
being once recognized, we have only to
inquire what rights man has to a
voice in government in order to discover
woman's right to the same, iiie, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness have been set forth
as the Inalienable rights of man. Kow, what
ever may be said as to the possibility of in
alienable rights in society, no one will deny
that these rights belong equally to both eexes.
If woman has the same right to life, liberty
and property that man has, then she has a
right to an equal protection, and tni3 is pre
cisely what is meant by the right of suffrage.
In consequence of the imperfect siate of
human society, governments are instituted to
secure these rights. Woman, having the
same rights as man, needs the same security.
Government Is therefore as necessary for one
as for the other. But government derives its
powers from the consent of the governed. I*
this declaration truet To deny it Is to deny
the fundamental principle of constitutional
government.
If true then our question is fairly and for
ever settled; and it requires no argument to
show tliat it is true, for it Is self-evident that
government exists by the consent of those wilh
whom it originates. It originated in tne neces
sities of both man and woman ; it must, there
fore, exist by tne consent of both man and
woman. Thus is the right of woman to the
ballot established in the first principles of our
Government. The wrong arising from with
holding suffrage from the women of th:s State
is not only negative but also positive. The
simple exclusion is but the mildest phase of
the injustice. The sin is more than doubled
when with this exclusion taxation is coupled.
Your women pay taxes upon millions of
dollars worth of real and personal property,
yet they are debarred from all representation
in the Government and cannot say how all this
money shall be expended. Thus does this so
called representative Government violate the
first principles of its own existence.
Suffrage for women is often objected to on
the ground of expediency. As if what i* right
is not always expedient. We are told that our
basis of representation Is already too ex
tended, and that to give the elective franchise
to women would ouly aggravate the evil. If
this be true, then let rea&ODable qualifications
be required for admission to the ballot; but let
all parties be subject to the same restrictions.
Let no advantage De given to sex. Let nothing
be made a disqualification for the exercise of
the right of suffrage, which will not apply to
one party with as much force as to another.
We are told that the result of the whole
ballot would remain the same, and so nothing
be gained. This objection, If true, does not in
any sense whatever affect the question under
consideration. Suppose that two men vote
opposite tickets, shall they be disfranchised
because their votes neutralize each other? I
so, then may one party cancel another of
equal number, and so all be disfranchised to
gether. This objection places no value on a
vote except as it subserves party interests and
ignores the duty and obligation of all to defend
what they believe to be right.
â¢â¢Women may relieve tberaselves of all
political responsibility by intrusting their In
terests to their husbands, fathers, broth
ers or sons." This statement involves a
moral impossibility, for it assumes that a right
or duty of one may be performed by another,
which is simply impossible. It is the old ap
peal for class power.
The majority of the objections urged against
women suffrage only prove the necessity of
the reform. They spring mainly from the con
servative icstincts of humanity, and are ob
jections to those only who seek to know what
is expedient before knowing what is right.
Conservatism is always shocked at the idea of
reform and shrinks from it Instead of main
taining the right, with all its consequences, i;
is forever tormenting Itself with tne problem
of expediency. Woman suffrage Is right and
therefore expedient. Ecu.s B. asthoxy.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Percy L. Shuman, formerly a journalist, then
a Chicago lawyer, and since last January
owner and operator of .several mines in Caia
veras and Amador counties, is at the Palace,
on his way East for a flying business trip. ll w
headquarters are at Happy Valler, near Mo*el
umne Hill, Calavera3 County, irom which
place he manages the North Star mine, a
gravel mine with a 10-stamp mill and employ
ing thirty men, lour quartz mines neer West
Point, and a mine near Jackson, Amador
County.
"I have just now been informed," said he
yesterday, "that Mr. Glesson has made a very
rich strike up our way â gravel worth $t> a carÂ«
load or about $10 a ton. Gravel-mining is the
most profitable in California. Out of $1,500,
--000.000 in gold produced in this Staje up to
1894, the time of the last official report, $716,
--000,000 was taken out of gravel, about
$300,000,000 produced from quartz mines,and
only about $300,000 washed out by ground
siuicing and hydraulic mining. There is a good
deal of activity in the mining districts about
Mokeiumne Hill. That country is the fceat
of the operations of the California Exploration
Company, which is spending large sums in
developing mines thereabouts, and that natur
ally attracts a good deal of other capital. Al
most all the mines are operated by Eastern
capital, and all are believed to be good paying
properties at present.
"There is the Esperanza, a quartz mine with
a 20-stamp mill in the immediate vicinity of
the North Star, and owned by Cleveland (Ohio)
men. Three miles away is the Gwin mine,
which has just completed a 40-stemp mill.
Over in Amador County the miners are looking
forward to tne building of a new railroad near
Jackson with electric branches tapping the
whole mining country, the power to be sup
plied from the plant of the California Explora
tion Company. Such a system will undoubt
edly be of great benefit to the whole district
and to the mining industry.
"In the last few weeks I neve noticed a great
change in the political aspect iv the mining
districts with which I come most in contact.
Where only a short time ago there was a pro
nounced sentiment in favor of free silver and
Bryan the miners are now very generally
favoring McKinley. They say that while they
favor the coinage of silver they are convinced
that protection to industry is the greatest is
sue in this campaign, and they are willing to
wait on the silver question until they can get
the Republican party to handle it with proper
safeguards. I honestly believe the miners are
all coming to realize that protection is the
greatest principle before the voters. Of course,
up round Angels Camp free silver will have a
great many supporters, but it will be largely a
personal matter and not a great principle, for
Charley Lane, one of the owners of the great
Utica mine, is a popular man, and many of the
men will vote for siiver beccuse he favors it and
perhaps because many of them are in Lane's
employ."
BRYAN AND THE YALE MEN
What a Democratic Newspapek Has to Bat
of the Incident.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
The mud-throwing sheet engineered by Silver
Willie, the boy editor, having devoted consid
erable space to adverse criticism of the recep
tion given by Windy Willie, the boy talker,
by Yale men aurint; his recent attempt to
wave the branches ia the City of Elms, it
would please a few old Yale men of this City
to hare Tee Call reprint the following ex
tracts from an editorial in the Sun of Sunday
last:
We have read carefully all the reports of
the proceedings of the Yale students which
were published in reputable newspapers of
New York. They agree in their statements of
the main facts, and tnerefore it may bo as
sumed that they are accurate.
What did these students really do? On ths
day that Yale University opened its new col
lege year Bryan came to' New Haven and pre
pared to address a great crowd at the Green,
adjacent to which are the college buildings
or tne center of the university life, in a town
of which the university is the great and distin
guishing feature. The students gathered in
strong iorce, as was natural. Practically they
were on their own ground. They expressed
tneir feelings against repudiation with the
vieor and vociferousness of youth; and they
had a right to do it. They ought to have dona
it; and the sentiment to whicn. they gave
utterance was honorable to tnem. The boys
made a great noise, cheering for McKinley
and yelling and jeering at repudiation, so
that Mr. Bryan could not be heard for several
minutes. If they had applauded him inces
santly for even a full half hour would there
have been any complaint of their preventing
him from starting out in his speech? Has not
a crowd in the open air as much right to hiss
as to cheer? At what period in our history
was that privilege taken from Americans?
These dissenting students, the reports agree,
did not offer any personal violence to Mr.
Bryan or anybody else. They did not throw
rotten eggs at him or otherwise assail his dig
nity, but merely shouted their college cry
and yelled derisively. They did not like the
cause the tpeakei represented. They de'ested
and despised both it and him; and they made
known their feelings noisily.
It is said that "the position of a candidate
for the Presidency of this great Republic car
ries with it the right to respect from all citi
zens, no matter to what party the candidate
may belong or what may be his political
creed." But it carries with it no such right.
No one, candidate for President or anybody
else, is entitled to respect unless he deserves
it. Should a candidate on a platform of rank
and frank treason to American freedom be re
ceived with honor simply because he is a can
didate ? This is arrant nonsense.
When Mr. Bryan began his speech he pro
ceeded to insult tbe students by insulting
their fathers. Would they not have teen con
temptible fellows if they had not resented his
words with all the force of expression in
language of which they were capable? Treat
such a man with respect! It would nave been
disgraceful to them if they had kept silence.
If he had a right to talk had they not an
equal right to respond? There was no obliga
tion of courtesy preventing them from utter
ing their inuiÂ«nant and derisive dissent.
He offered" himself ior criticism and he has no
reason to complain because be got it.
Tne Yale studeau did runt. They may
have been boisterous beyond the measure of
necessity, after the fashion of college boys;
but the spirit animating them was wholly
honorable, wholly commendable. Their
fathers have good reason to be proud of suca
sous.
The Yale students detest repudiation, and
all honor to them for the feeling! When they
come forth from their little college world into
the broad wor.d of society ihey wi".] msjee
good citizens. They will fitly rustaln the
burden of duty to the Republic when, ia the
cruel and relentless order of nature, it mas:
be transferred to their shoulder* by their
fathers. Truly veers. Howard K. Jaxes.

BEAUTIFUL SONNET, BY AN
ENGLISHWOMAN OF SCANT FAME,
BUT RARE TALENT IN BELLES LETTRES
The dedication of a book often forms an in
teresting clew to the personality of Its author.
One unfamil iar with Alice Meywell happening
upon ber volume, '-The Color of Life," and
seeing it inscribed to Coventry Patmore might
easily place her among that literary set so
greatly prevailing Just now in London. This
surmise would be still further confirmed by
observing that the dedication of Francis
Thompson's end of the century volume of
verses is to "Wilfred and Alice Meywell." The
mark of the Vigo-street publishers on the
title page of Mrs. Weywell's little crushed
raspberry covered tookâ let us hope that
is not the "color of life" âin itself con
veys a sort of distinction. A gordly com-
pany are those writers of "The Bodley
Head." who are conjured up by the very men
tion of the name. Ie Gailienne comes first by
virtue of his being the earliest books sent out
by the firm, which has evolved from the little
second-hand bookshop established in Vigo
street by Elkin Mathews and named "The Bod
ley Head" in honor of the founder of Oxford's
library, Into the cow distinguished publishers
who have achieved tne difficult art ot making
poetry pay. This has teen chiefly accom
plished by choice and limited editions and the
ensuing fad for owning or speculating in the
same.
Norman Gale has been particularly fortu
nate in this respect. Great prices have been
paid for some of his early editions. He has
been called the "Watteau of poetry." In spite
of which fact he is said to be over six feet
i tall and a mighty football player at Rugby,
. where he is a master. His personality seems
strangely at variance with the artificial dainti
ness of his verse.
Lord ac Tabley, through The Bodley Head,
gained the fame he had been cheated of in
youth. .Before his death he had the gratifica
tion of seeing his hitherto unheeded poems
read and talked of on every side.
That sweet Frances Wynne, whose slender,
girl's volume, "Whisper." Lc Gallienne tells us
of so charmingly in "Sandra Belloni's Pine
wood," also made her entrance into
the literary world from Vigo street.
W. B. Yeats, John Davidson, Cosmo
Monkhouse, Richard Garnett, and many more
belong to the same good fellowship. Francis
Thompson has, perhaps, won more fame than
any other with his strangely powerful poems:
like Rossetti's, spiritual, "yet tinged with a
sort of earthiness. Theirs is not only a heaven
of "continued identity," but a heaven of con
tinuedâif sublimatedâ as well.
Francis Thompson has madeâ with the ex
, ception of his poemsâ miserable failure of
his life on earth. He has taken what remains
of a wreck to a remote monastery in Wales.
His "Hound of Heaven," written from his own
deepest experience, haunts the reader with a
strange insistency.
The name of Francis Thompson brings us
back to our starting-point, for observing his
dedication we learn with interest that Mrs.
Mey well herself once bore the name. We are
led to wonder whether the regard that
prompted the inscription was brotherly rather
than literary. However that may be, it was as
Alice Thompson that Mrs. Meywell first gave
her poems to the world, a very unheeding and
inattentivee world, as it proved.
Nearly all readers of books are familiar with
I the great picture, entitled "The Rollcall,"
which so touched the heart of England that
its young painter, Elizabeth Thompson, was
followed by a mob of people thronging to
catch a glimpse of her face whenever she went
upon the street. The grim patnos of the com
i positionâ that straggling row of men answer
% In* the namecall after the battle â is known
to all. Thn sincerity of the treatment, the
terribly suggested tragedy of war, compel in
the spectator that ache in the throat which
comes from feelings profoundly moved.
I The same year, 1875, that was fi.led with
the furor for this picture, saw the birth of a
slender and modest volume of poems by the
painter's sister. Her work, reserved, recluse
in style, never appealed to the general public
and was quite- lost sight of in the other's
brilliant success. For all this Alice Thomp-
Eon, who a short time after this became Alice
Meywell, was still the "poets' poet." A few
years ago, when that general outflowing of
English minor poetry began, a new edition of
Alice Meywell's poems was issued by the Vigo
street publishers, together with a volume of
esseys called "The Rhythm of Life."
These were followed only a fow months ago
by a second volume of essays "called "Tne
Color of Life." Now, the critics have told us
so much in praise of these two books that we
approach their reading with some trepida
tion. When one is informed by no unweighty
authority that these deserve to be ranked
with the "Essays in Criticism" and the "Stud- i
ies of the Renaissance," one, as an admirer of
Mathew Arnold and a lover of Walter Pater,
feels inclined to argue the point beforehand.
When one has for long found much mental
sustenance in the vigorous thought and fine
Irony of Mr. Arnold, and pored with an ever
increasing affection over the subtleties and
the beauties of Mr. Pater's style, one does not
so easily put a stranger cheek-by-jowl on the
shelf with them. â â¢ Excessive praise is almost
as blighting to the fresh enjoyment of a book
as excessive disparagement. Tne former antag
onizes, while the latter may lead to a pleasant
voyage of original discovery.
R Still we listen with respect when Mr. Pat
more tells us that Mrs. Meywell has gained in
her writings that singularly rare attribute of
her sexâ true distinction. And alterâ not the
first reading but the second or thirdâ we come
very nearly to agree with what Mr. Tat more and
all the others have said In her honor. She dis
i tinguishes proudly in the use of words, as one
t who feels the noblesse oblige of a birthright of
\^letters. We find no turgid utterance here, no
exaggeration. Instead, a calmness which
reveals a latent power, a dignity of reserve
which shrinks from qver. emphasis. After
. reading her we almost hesitate to quote Mr.
Sharp's high praise of her sonnet, "Renounce
ment," or his mention of Dante Gabriel
Rossetti's opinion that It Is "one of the three
finest sonnets ever written by women." She
has herself made us feel that superlative ap
proach vulgarity. We are quite certain
that she would herself never â¢> indulge in
sweeping generalities. One feels a ' curiosity,
by the way, as to whose Mr. Kossetti's two
other sonnets were. One his sister Christina's

* The Bonnet form never i touches the heart
quite so nearly as the lyric, yet the beauty
and passionate tenderness of this are revealed
in the re-reading. We never get the bbesott ot
Alice Meywell in the first glance. Her thought,
if we would not miss it, compels an answering
reflection.
In her essay, "The Woman In Gray," we find
some thoughts on the "woman question," ex
pressed with what dignity and potency! She
calls our attention to the fact that women, by
some unaccountable reason, are held to "de-
rive from their mothers and grandmothers
and men from their fathers and grandfathers," â 
instead of the "participation of man and â¢
woman In their common heritage" being con- ;
fessed.
"Long generations of subjection are,
strangely enough, held to excuse ihe timor
ousnesa and the shifts of women to-day.
But the world, unknowing, tampers with the
courage of its sons by such a slovenly indul
gence. It tampers with their intelligence by
fostering the ignorance of women."
"Thou art my warrior," said Volumnia. "I i
help to frame thee. Shall a man inherit his I
mother's trick of speaking or her habit or j
attitude, and not suffer something against
his will from her bequest of weakness, and
j something against his heart from her be
quest of folly? From the legacies of an un
lessoned mind a woman's heirsâ male â are not j
cut off in the common law of the generations
of mankind. Brutus knew that the valor ol
Portia was settled upon his soul."
And of this particular "woman In gray,"
who is so largely a creation of to-day, she
writes :
'â She had learnt the difficult peace oi sus
pense. She had learnt, also, the lowly and
self-denying faith in common chances. She
had learnt to be content with her shareâ no
j moreâ in common security, and to be pleased
I with her part In common hope. For all this,
j it may be repeated, she could have had but
â¢ small preparation. Yet no anxiety was hers,
no uueaty distrust and unbelief of that human
thingâ an average of life and death. To this
{ courage the woman in gray had attained with
i a spring."
Mrs. Meywell shows her critical power in the
essay on "Eleanora Duse." "Grabs" is one of
the most charming of the sketches. Her ob
servation of nature is sympathetic and un
i hackneyed to a degree, as may be seen from
the following, from "Rushes aud Reeds":
"Taller than the grass and lower than the
trees, there is another growth that feels the
implicit spring. â¢ â¢ â¢ Ours is a summer
full of voices, and therefore it does not so need -
the sound of rushes; but they are most sensi
tive to the stealthy breezes and betrey the
passing of a wind that even the treetops know
not of. Sometimes it is a breeze unfelt, but
the stiff sedges whisper it along a mile of
marsh. To the strong wind they bend, show
ing the silver of their somber little tassels as
fisn show the silver of their sides turning in
the pathless sea. They are unanimous. A field
of tall flowers tosses many ways in one warm
gale, like the many lovers of a poet who have
a thousand reasons for their love; Dut the
rushes, more strongly tethered, are swept into
a single attitude again and again at every re
newal of the storm."
On the whole Alice Meywell may well be
come one of the most intimate of our literary
friends. Grace S. Musses.
PROCESSES OF REASONING.
THE METHOD OF DARWIN. By Frank
Cramer: Chicago, A. C. McCluig & Co., pub
lishers. For sale by A. .M, HODertson; cloth,
I rice $L
As a rule, says this author, scientific men are
so deeply engrossed In their investigations
that they rarely undertake to discuss method,
and this attempt to analyse the method em
ployed in tho biological sciences arose from the
belief that the airect study of scientific
method, as it is illustrated by the works of the
accepted masters, is worthy of far more atten
tion than is usually accorded to it. "The logi
cal processes involved and the nature of the
difficulties met with in scientific Investigation
are the same as in the practical affairs of life.
The fundamental processes of reasoning are
the same everywhere; and it cannot but be
helpful to study those processes as they are ar>
plied by master minds In fields where preci
sion of method is peculiarly essential." Mr.
Cramer's reason for selecting Darwin's works
as a basis for an analysis of scientific method
were, namely: "(1) The desire to confine the
discussion to the writings of a single author,
in order to concentrate the reader's attention
upon a model; (2) the fact tnat Darwin's
works cover a wide range of subjects, and can
be read end understood by those who have had
only a moderate amount of scientific training;
VERL AINE WROTE ONE
BOOK TOO MANY
AND WILL NOT GET A
LUXEMBOURG MONUMENT
A few short months ago the sentiment in
France had almost assured for the memory of
Paul Verlaine a monument in the Luxembourg
side by side with those of Alfred de Musset
and Theodore de Banville. A few short
months, however, has witnessed a material
change in public opinion there with reference
to "the beggar poet," and to-day it is said to
be quite certain that the statue of the author of
"Ganymede" and "Amies" will never figure in
that high company. In literature it seems to
have been Verlaine's misfortune to have writ
ten one book too many. The posthumous issue
of that bookâ "lnvectives" â has roused op
position to the proposal in question among
those who on the morrow of Verlaine's death
had generously agreed to overlook the 9eamy
side of his private life and the indefensible
nature of a portion of his work in considera
tion of the real beauty of some aspects of his
talent. "Invectives" has not yet reached us,
but an Eastern critic sets it down as "a sadly
poor took, a sorry, good-for-nothing book, in
wnich it would be hard to hunt up one line
that deserved printing. It contains, abuse of
the men and women who played a part in Ver
laine's troubled existence, abuse of his wife,
of his fellow men of letters, many of them his ,
beneiactors: of the magistrates who had occa
sion to sentence him, of the doctors who kept
him alive. The abuce is of the lowest order,
scurrilous, witless and couched in doggerel
verse. The volume would be beneath notice
but for the effect its publication has had."
In the iace of all this it Is rather interesting
to note that the Londou Spectator, in a review
of "Invectives," applies to the author the
term, "the greatest poet in France." Of the
volume, which has cnused the altered feeling
in Verlaine's native country the harshest
thing this reviewer says is that "the book is
packed with material of offense, and perhaps
it would have been better to publish it before
death had made reparation imi>ossible." The
book, it would appear, Is really welcomed by
the reviewer, as "It completes the character of
the peet-"
"Born with an exquisite talent for verseâ a
talent which neither poverty nor misfortune
has impaired â Verlaino was also born into a
modern, logical world with a careless habit of
the eypsy. He found it perpetually impossible
to square his temper with his surroundings;
his books were an example and a delight to a
whole generation, but he remains the feckless
beggar of the middle ages. Though he gave
far more than his contemporaries could repay
his life was a long experience of poverty and
neglect; and, worse than all, the ungenerous
curiosity of his friends, combined with his own
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
and (3) above all, the fact that Darwin's in
vestigations, and the reasonings based noon
them, have furnished the biological sciences
with their dominant principles." Some of the
most important logical processes have been
selected, and Darwiu's applications of them
illlustrated in such h way as to confine the
whole discussion within the narrowest possi
ble limits. Mr. Cramer is one of the able
young men of Stanford University, aud his
book will doubtless give rise to much discus
sion in scientific circles.

years to the production of this volume, and
the mechanical production is probably unsur
passed by anything ever put together in book
form. The illustrations are by Burne-Jones,
who is accounted the foremost artist of the
country in such work. Speaking of this book,
a member of the publishing firm said to an
interviewer of the Londou Chronicle:
As far as the printing is concerned I believe
that no modern book can compete with It. The
volumes of the fifteenth century are in some re
spects perfect, but no medieval work was pro
dnced with so much ornament combined with
pictures by first-class artists. The paper for this
edition of Chaucer, which is entirely of linen, was
specially made in Kent. There are 654 pages In
the book, which Is printed in "Chaucer type" in
black acid red. Thirteen copies have been printed
on vellum, of which only eight were for sale a
Â£146 each. Of paper copies at Â£'20 there were 425
The entire edition, I may add, was sold months
ago. Very little profit, if any, however, can be
imperturbable candor, convinced the ignorant
that he was a monster, to whom all the vices
were familiar. Thus he wandered from cafe to
cafe, from hospital to hospital, the greatest
poet in France; and his poverty is another
proof that genius can hardly be translated into
bread and butter.
"He was denounced for a scoundrel by those
who knew the habit of his life better than his
poems, and the truth is, he was but a child or
a savage. And being child or savage, he was
always a gentleman. Petulant, capricious, ir
regular, he preserved amid bis inevitable
squalor a strange and simple refinement,
which the literary tourist could never ap
preciate. To the end he retained a boyish
faith in the near approach of wealth. 'I am
popular in England and America,' he once
said, 'and that means I shall make money.'
Of course the money was never made, but the
eternal hopefulness was its own reward. Dur
ing the last days of his life, says rumor, he was
occupied in covering the squalid furniture of
his squalid room with gold paint, and there is
a terrible pathos in the vague hope of ag
grandizement which prompted this amiable
diversion. That such a man should be misun
derstood was inevitable, and yet Verlaine
committed no crime, save one which he ex
piated in prison, to justify the monstrous
aspersion which moralist and sentimentalist
have cast upon his charaoter.
"To the ignorant his name is a synonym for
impropriety, but, If you put aside a single vol
ume â 'Parallelement'â tnera is not one of his
works which could offer the slightest affront
to a proper modesty. And where in modern
literature shall you find a daintier set of im
pressions than 'Romances sans Paroles,' a
more delicate expression of love than 'La
Bonne Chanson,' or a nobler piece of devotion
than 'Sagesse'? That he resented the misap
preciation In which his own recklessness had
helped to involve him there was no proof un
til to-day. But in his 'Invectives' he makes
clear his own sensitiveness and attacks all
those who have patronised hia poetry and de
famed his life. The book is packed with ma
terial of offense, and perhaps It would nave
been better to publish It before death had
made reparatlou impossible. None the less, it
completes the character of the poet and shows
that tor all his simplicity he fiercely resented
the infamy of his enemies and the lamentable
indiscretion of his pretended friends. Among
the victims of his invective are journalists,
critics, doctors, magistrates and anarchists.
His hatred of professional literature is digni
fied in its sincerity. 'I hate,' says he, 'all tuat
savors of literature.' "

STORY OF SOUTHERN LIFE.
A TOWER IN THE DESERT. By Virginia D.
Young. Boston: The Arena Publishing Com
jn:ii.-. For sale by the trade; cloth, $1 25; paper,
SO cents.
This is a story of Southern life which Illus
trates the wide-reaching influence for good
which, even those in humble positions can
exert in uplifting and broadening the vision
of others, when prompted by unselflsnnessand
nobility of purpose. Incidentally the great
work accomplished by the Women's Christian
Temperance Union is emphasized, and the
rapid broadening ot woman's ideals and con
ceptions in the South is suggested. The char
acters are admirably drawn, tho author pos
sesses a strong vein of humor and has a keen
eye for the comedy as well as the tragedy of
life. It is a most excellent book for the young,
especially young ladies, although all lovers of
wholesome stories of real life as it exists to
day, free from feverish unreality, will find it
enjoyable.

As Professor Jordan says in the preface to
the volume before us, it is made up of sketches
reprinted from various periodicals and coming
under the general head of popular science.
Most of the articles have baen freely retouched
since th^lr original "appearance. The book
corresponds in part to the first edition of "Sci
ence Sketches." published in 1887. Eight of
the articles are the same, being printed from
the same plates with a few verbal changes.
For certain others of the first editionâ the ac
counts of "Agassiz at Penikese," "The Fate of
Iciodorum, " "The Story of a Btrange Land"
and "How the Trout Came to California"â
articles wrlttea since 1887 have been substi
tuted. Professor Jordan ranks very high as a
popular-science writer. He clothes his sub
jects in garbs so attractive as io readily inter

they are familiar witb the technical science of
the matter treated.

A GERMAN REALIST.
LOU. By Baron yon Roberts. Translated from
the German by Jessie Haynes. New York:
American Publishers' Corporation.
Edmund Gosse say* that at this moment
Baron yon Roberts Is one of the most active
and most popular novelists of Germany.
Though not a young man, he is young as an
author, and as he has English and French
blood In him, he is set down as another in
stance of the frequency with which, talent is
displayed by men of mixed race. The Baron
is 51 years old and led a military life until
about 1886, wnen his success in literature in
duced him to lay down'the sword and Join the
army oi the pen. His first remarkable effort
was a short story, "It," which won a prize in
Vienna in 1882. The volume before us was
his first novel and it aDpeared in 1886. It
cannot be regarded as a great novel, but on
the score of realism it is remarkable in some
chapters. The author describes, with un
doubted accuracy, many of his own actual ex
periences. It was certainly a test of the
author's skill to have handled such material
as that upon which "Lou" is based in such a
manner as not to have excited ridicule.
"Lou" is the story of a young Nubian slave,
bought in a market-place of Cairo by a French
marquis and man of the world, who takes him
as a valet to Paris. Lou Is & simple child of
nature, with a great capacity for affection.
He loves his master and next after him the
master's dog, Zeppa. The Nubian boy and the
dog make the acquaintance of Lilt, the rogu
ish daughter of a shoemaker who mistreats
her. Lili tries to teach the Nubian Doy to love
ncr, but she disappears just as her lessons are
beginning to be understood. Lou's master
suicides, and he then overhears Count Cabrera
and another intimate of the Marquis discuss
ing which one shall succeed to the ownership
of the Nubian and which to that of the dog.
Lou and Zeppa flee and run right into a mena
gerie, and their connection with it forms the
comedy feature of the book. Soon again they
become outcasts. Footsore and starving, they
reach a fair near Paris, where Zeppa loses his
freedom for stealing a piece of meat and Lou
is turned out upon the highway. All seems
dark, when suddenly he encounters Lili again,
now a diva with a host of admirers and among
them the Count Cabrera. She takes up
the Nubian, makes a place for him in
her household and tries to make a Parisian
of him, Dut he still remains the simple savage
and her devoted slave. Cabrera and other
suitors of Lili (now called Miraj grow jealous.
A f air is held at Mira's house and everything
that can be suggested is offered at auction.
On Cabrera's suggestion the Nubian is sold.
\Vhen the truth is made known to Lou his
heart is broken and he rushes out of the
house. He wanders along the street till he
comes upon Zeppa harnessed to a cart and be
ing beaten. He releases the dog by force ana
is about to escape when he is run over by a
van. He is taken to a hospital, where he dies
of his Injuries. In his delirium he calls for
his dog aud it Is brought to his bedside. A
Sister of Charity tries to make him understand
about heaven, but he wants to go to Zept>a's
heaven, not to a heaven where there are peo
ple. Learning of his death the Countess Ca
brera, a prey to remorse, had a fine monument
erected to Lou's memory. All the inscription
it bore was in three lettersâ "L-O-U."

INSTRUCTION FOR NURSES.
PRACTICAL POINTS IB NURSING. By
>mily A. M. Btoney. Philadelphia: W. B.
Baunders, publisher; 460 pages; olothbound,
price 91 76.
This is a comprehensive and exceedingly
valuable work of its kind. It is intended for
nurses in private practice and contains rules
for feeding the sick, recipes for invalid foods
and beverages, weights and measures, dose
list, and a full glossary of medical terms and
nursing treatment. The authoress is a gradu
ate of the Training School for Nurses at Law
rence, Mass., and superintendent of the Train
ing School for Nurses at Carney Hospital,
South Boston, Mass. In popular language and
in the shortest possible form is explained the
entire range of private nursing as distin
guished from hospital nursing, and it is
attempted to instruct the nurse how best to
meet the various emergencies of medical and
surgical cases when distant from medical or
surgical aid, or when thrown on the nurse's
own resources. The discussions in the book,
being based on a scries of lectures delivered
before the Carney Training Bchool for Nurses,
will, it is suggested, serve as a textbook for
student nurses and a useful teaching-book for
those occupying positions as teachers In
training-schools, and the volume may prove
interesting to the "home" nurse who wishes
to comprehend something of the purposes of
the different methods adopted in nursing
treatment.

A POWERFUL NEW
NOVEL BY A MAN
WHO IS BETTER KNOWN
AS A HUMORIST
THE STATEMENT OF STELLA MABEKLT.
By F. Anstey. New York: 1). Appleton A Co.
tor sale In this City by William Doxev, Palace
Hotel. Price $1 20.
It is one of the misfortunes attendant upon
the writer of a humorous book that he is for
ever after expected to remain a humorist. If
he should venture into other fields of litera
ture the public feels itself hurt and aggrieved
and is seldom willing to give credit where
credit is due. The reception accorded to Mark
Twain's "Joan of Arc" last year will be remem
bered as a case in point. Up to the time that
Mr. Clemens confessed to the authorship its
sales were remarkably good. Then came the
announcement that the creator of Tom Sawyer
had appeared as a writer of historical fiction.
The public thereupon assumed an injured air,
made unkind remarks about "going out of his
line," and sales fell off. They wanted the gen
ial Mark to remain a humorist, not to enter
into competition with Macaulay.
These preliminary remarks are timely in
view of the publication by Messrs. Appleton
of a new book by F. Anstey. This author's
name is one with which to conjure to the
younger generation of readers both in Eng
land and in the United States. What healthy
minded youngster is there who could help
laughing heartily at tne adventures or mis
adventures of Paul Bultitude Esq., merchant
"of Mincing Lane, City," as narrated in "Vice-
Versa"? How screamingly funny is that scene
in the railway carriage, when the magnate,
reduced to the proportions of an ordinary
schoolboy, gravely offers the head master a
cigar, with some valuable suggesldons touch
ing the Japanese camphor crop. And then
there is that other of Mr. Anstey's humorous
books, "Tinted Venus." Can one recall with
out a laugh the perplexities of the poor cock
ney barber who sets in motion the mystic
machinery that brings a Grecian damsel to
life?
The latest of Mr. Anstey's books is entitled,
"The Statement of Stella Maberiy." It is a
powerfully written work slightly reminiscent
of "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde," but differing
from anything heretofore penned by our
author. A short summary of the tale will in
dicate this:
Stella Maberiy, who makes the "statement"
of wnich the book is composed, is introduced
to the. reader as a schoolgirl whose parents are
well-to-do. She posses&es a peculiar tempera
ment, and at school becomes the chum of
Evelyn Heseltine. Upon leaving school Stella
finds home unbearable, owing to the fact that
her father has remarried and her stepmother
is uncongenial. Unfortunate speculation has
somewhat reduced her father's circumstances,
and Stella decides to go to Surrey as the com
panion of her old schoolmate, who, since leav
ing school, has been "finished" on the Conti
nent.
During her stay abroad Evelyn has met and
received attentions from a neighbor, Hugh
Dallas, who subsequently calls upon her.
Stella promptly falls in love with him, thus
complicating matters somewhat. Her pecu
liar temperament exhibits itself in the form of
a jealousy of her schoolmate who had
prior claim to Dallas' affections. Oue night,
after a severe tiff with her companion,
Evelyn Is not feeling very well, and, being
troubled with insomnia, her aunt, on the ad
vice of Stella, administers chloraL The drug
takes effect, but not before Evelyn has writ
ten a hurried note to Stella saying that Dallas
is in love with the latter, and that his visits to
Evelyn have really been for the purpose of see
ing her companion.
Stella is stricken with remorse. She has
passed a sleepless night, and before daybreak
goes to Evelyn's room. The girlish figure before
her is a corpse. By intent if not in fact a
murderess, she calls upon her friend, and after
adopting remedial measures Is rewarded by
seeing the eyes open and the cheeks flush.
Wild with delight, she confesses all, praying
for forgiveness. To her horror she discovers
that while the being before her has the form
of Evelyn Heseltine some mysterious agency
has implanted into the body characteristics
entirely foreign to her. From the simple
minded, innocent girl, just out of her teens,
she has become a fiend incarnate.
It is at this stage that the resemblance to Dr.
Jekyl and Mr. Hyde is the most noticeable.
The newly created Evelyn Heseltine possesses
two naturesâ her own, sweet, angelic almost in
its purity; the other devilish, cruel, intrigu
ing. The fact of Anstey's work resembling
Stevenson's notwithstanding the descriptive
writing at this point is really striking. It is
dramatic, intense. If it be a copy, the copy Is
worthy of the original, and surely this is
praise.
The conclusion of the story tells of the
onion of Hugh Dallas with Evelyn Heseltine,
that estimable lady rightly supposing a mar
riage with her companion's ideal to be the re
finement of torture. Dallas soon finds that
Evelyn is not the simple schoolgirl he imag
ined her to be. She worries him into illness,
and the book comes to an end with the strang
ling of the fiend by Stella Maberiy and the
death of Dallas by means of a pistol wound
self-inflicted.
Returning to our original proposition, we
must confess to a slight feeling of disappoint
ment at the turn taken by Mr. Anstey's genius.
With due deference to his own good judgment,
he is somewhat out ot his element. Most as
suredly he is at his best as a humorist, and it
is probable that liovel-readers will use the
same means of convincing him of the fact that
they employed in the case of his contempo
rary, Mr. Clemens. Nevertheless our first
statement still holds that the book under re
view is a remarkable one, well and powerfully
written. Â£. Elzab.
CONTENTS OF
SOME OF THE
NEW MAGAZINES.
THB CBNTCBY.
Among the contents of the October Century
are several articles bearing upon topics that
are now prominently before the public "A
Study of Mental Epidemics," by Boris Bidis, is
a scientific and suggestive paper of contempo
raneous interest. Another article of immedi
ate interest is a paper on John P. Hale, "A
Presidential Candidate of 1852," by his asso
ciate on the Free-Soil ticket, the Hon. George
W. Julian. A paper "About French Children,"
their education, training, manners and
nature, by Th. Bentzon (Mme. Blanc), is pro-,
fusely illustrated by the noted delineator of
children, Boutet de Monvel. Professor Sloane
brings his life of Napoleon to a conclusion
in strikingly illustrated chapters on the
battle of Waterloo and the exile to St. Helena,
and the Hon. John A. Kasson in "Open Let
ters" places a' high estimate on the character
of the work. "Glave in the Heart of Africa"
is the third paper from the journals and
photographs of the late E. J. Glave, and is de
voted to the better known region between
Lakes Bangweolo and Tanganyika, where he
had his roughest experiences and witnessed
the bsleaguerment of the last slavers' strong
hold in the territory of the Congo Free State.
HABPER'S.
Harper's Magazine contains the first in
stallment of Mr. dv Manrier's long-expected
novel, "The Martian." The opening scenes
are laid in a boys' school in Paris in the early
fifties, and the hero Is introduced at the very
beginning of his career. It seems not unlikely
that Mr. dv Maurier, following the example of
Fielding and Thackeray, will attempt in "The
Martian*' to portray the character of a man
in the same catholic spirit in which "Tom
Jones" and "Pendennis" were created. Of
one thing there can be no doubt. The story
has all the spontaneity and charm of "Trilby"
and "Peter Ibbetson," and the author's rela
tion to his reader is as cordial and confidential
as only Mr. dv Maurier knows how to make it.
A fine new portrait of the author of "The
Martian" is the frontispiece to the number.
Frederic Remington relates some of his ex
periences in hunting 'â The Blue Quail of the
Cactus" as he found this game in Northern
Mexico. Samuel H. Scudder describes "Some
American Crickets," with illustrations of in
teresting varieties, and Judge Walter Clark
contributes "A Recovered Chapter in Ameri
can History," describing the ill-starred expe
dition of England and her American colonies
against Cartagena in 1740.
The October number of Scribner's Magazine
is strong in American subjects of immediate
interest, including in its contents a powerful
and satirical essay by E. L. God Kin on "The
Expenditure of Rich Men"; a broad and
thoughtful discussion of the great problems
that underlie "The Government of Greater New
York," by Colonel F. V. Greene ; a paper on the
way in which "The New York Working-Girl"
has organized to take care of herself; a sym
pathetic essay on the work of Olin Warner, the
eminent American sculptor who recently died ;
and a description of the picturesque and
romantic features of the lighthouse system
along the North Atlantic coast. The Ameri
canism of this number in subject and in an
ttiorship is its most pronounced feature. It is
a notable fact that there is not a single foreign
contributor on the literary side of the number
except Mr. Barrie and his remarkable serial.
BEVTEW OF REVIEWS.
The Review of Reviews continues its ad
mirable record of the Presidential campaign.
In the July, August and September numbers
the Republican, Democratic and Populist con
ventions were reviewed, together with the
careers of the nominees. In the October num
ber the movement of the "sound-money"
Democrats, culminating in the Indianapolis
convention, receives similar attention. No
other publication in the country offers in a
single number such a wealth of political por
traiture, or so wide a range of cartoon illustra
tions. Every noteworthy phase of t he canvass
is fully and impartially* presented. Material
is gathered from every source and carefully
digested.
THK FOBT7M.
The October Forum contains, under the cap
tion "What Free Coinage Means," four note
worthy articles on the silver question: "Com
pulsory Dishonesty," by Hon. Benjamin Har
rison; "Free Coinage and Life Insurance
Companies," by John A. McCall, president of
the New York Life Insurance Company ; "Free
Coinage and Trust Companies," by Edward
King, president of the Union Trust Company,
and "Free Coinage and Farmers," by John M.
Stahl, secretary of the Farmers' National Con
gress. General Harrison's paper is an ex
tremely valuable contribution to the dis
cussion. It is probably the plainest, clearest,
most powerful and most convincing argument
against the free coinage of silver at the ratio
of 10 to 1 that has yet appeared.
ST. NICHOLAS.
The October issue of St. Nicholas is a very
full number, the table of contents Including
more than thirty contributions. The frontis
piece is a characteristic drawing by George
Wharton Edwards, illustrating a poem,
"Katrinka," by Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge. A
story of the good old days in Sherwood Forest,
entitled, "George o' Green and Robin Hood,"
and written by Caroline Brown, tells ot a
sturdy swineherd wno overcame most of the
outlaw band at their own sports. "A Vege
table Ogre," described by Eustace B. Rogers, is
the wila fig tree of the West Indies which.
Kills the tree that gives shelter to its
sÂ»ed. Charles G. D. Roberts, in "The
Fire on the Water," writes of the exciting
scenes that followed the wrecking of an
oil train on a Canadian railway. "The Horses
of the Castle," by Tudor Jenks, is a tale of the
olden times with a modern application. J. L.
Sticht of the United States navy describes
some "Historic Military Powder-Horns" that
were carried in the Colonial and Revolution
ary wars. These were rudely engraved with
patriotic sentiments or with maps of routes
through the wilderness. "The True Story of
Marco Polo," which Noah Brooks is telling for
young readers, gives an account of the build
ing of the famous palace in Xanadu that in
spired Coleridge's poem.
OTJTIN9.
Outing for October is a most readable num
ber, and carries many fine illustrations. A
strong, complete story of the old South by the
brilliant pen of Sara Beaumont Kennedy will
please all readers. Other notable features In
clude "Football," by Walter Camp ; "Trotting
Road Teams and Their Drivers," by Â£. B. Ab
ercrombie; "A Day on the Uplands," by Ed
W. Sandys; "Racing Schooners," by R. B.
Burchard; "Bear-hunting in British Colum
bia," by W. Â£. Coffin, and "American and
Eng lisa Boats and Oars," by Charles Mellen.
LITERARY NOTES.
Professor John C. Van Dyke has edited a col

NEW AND BEAUTIFUL AUTUMN FANCIES OF THE DRESSMAKERS
Ppineess I
Walking I
Costume j
The artist .has reproduced for us two
charming walking gowns suitable for the
season. The left-hand figure is a becom
ing form of princes? gown fashioned in a
fine gray faced cloth, with lapels and
miniature panels of white fastened with
small gilt buttons. Frilled chiffon bor
ders the neck and the grass lawn fichu.
The second costume is of coarse canvas
in a light shade of gendarme blue, with a
frilled Test and strappings of black satin,
finished with paste buckles. The sfeeves
of this gown are of particularly original
design, while the neck has alternately
ruffles of black satin and cream-colored
embroidered lisse.
Almost equally interesting are the mod
els for blouse suitable either for afternoon
or theater wear. One boasts a particu
larly original development of the rucned
chiffon sleeve, with insertions of gold
detailed embroidery and a triple frill, in
place of the usual shoulder puff. A fichu
like drapery is drawn up from the side
seams to the left shoulder and there
caught with a paste buckle.
Black and white striped silk forms the
material for the second design, of which
the Y-shaped neck is bordered by three
rows of embroidered iisse, the same lisae
forming a full double frill at the elbow.
No. 3 is noticeable for a Zouave-like yoke
of sequin-embroidered grass lawn, the
same embroidery appearing on the chiffon
â¢Jeeves. Brocade forms the lower part of
the bodice and the smart shoulder knots.
Borne lovely and very smart cloth gowns
will soon be sent home by an excellent
tailor. One, consisting of a coat and skirt,
Is composed of the finest purple beaver
cloth, the collar being faced and the cuffs
trimmed with a rich dahlia-colored velvet.
Such a combination is indeed daring, but
really most effective. A chic row of tiny
black cords and barrels finishes the loose
fitting fronts and the sleeves as well.
Mink borders the epaulettes and collar,
and also extends down the fronts. The
lining is a shot-dahlia taffeta. A great
black velvet picture hat with seven beau
tiful ostrich plumes completes a fetching
toilette â and make a mental note of the
fact that all such chapeaux must have at
least seven plumes of the choicest descrip
tion. More may be worn, if you are tall
enough, but not less, even if you are only
five feet in height, for this is one of
fashion's imperative mandates.
There is a revival in the fancy for serge
in London, Â±*aris and New York, so we
may shortly expect to see a very stylish
bride arrayed in one of the most exquis- ,
itely fine navy blue serges ever made with
reveres faced with white moire, edged by
a fine hair-like cord of mixed dark blue
and silver. The coat is lined with the
white moire, but the skirt has a sensible
lining of blue taffeta. Such a costume
would be excellent for a matron if black
moire were used instead of the white.
Smart is also a costume, just completed,
of a black cloth, which has a very narrow
white stripe and fixings of white velvet.
The short, neat, little basque buttons up
(slantingly) the left side with eighteen
small tailor-buttons. A medium sized
black velvet hat with a touch of white
velvet and nodding plumes is in keeping.
A lovely dark-eyed schoolgirl who will
make her debut ere long is a fetching
picture in a costume of brown heather
mixture tweed. The coat has a semi-loose
back, held by one of the stylish belts of
crimson leather. The front is loose, and
wheu open reveals a vest of dark crimson
cloth embroidered in a darker brown ana
crimson, and a thread of gold. Just a tint
of red runs through the tweed. The braid
ing is wonderfully effective and a crimson
glace taffeta lines it. A brown felt hat is
trimmed with wide bows of brown taffeta.
A knot ot crimson velvet rests next the
ausky hair.
Very recently an unusually handsome
woman wore a pale green silk covered
with striped rather light blue canvas, the
bodice being of blue and green brocade
adorned with _old galon as a girdle, soft
grayish chiffon with rucned ends was
worn very gracefully. It was about three
yards and three-quarters in length.
A young woman on the same occasion
appeared in a stylish gown of pretty col
ored face cloth. The loose jacket lined with
turquoise blue taffeta had three really
beautiful buttons of a turquoise blue set
in silver down the front. Worn under the
swell coat was a blouse of turquoise blue
taffeta with a ypke of fine silver embroid
ery. This also formed cuftÂ«, and the slen
der, graceful figure might have passed for
a Paris fashion plate, for the hat of pretty
colored straw was braided with turquoise
lined chinelle. At the left side was a
large aigrette of white and gray, the crown
being encircled with a loose twist of blue
and gray velvet The gray gloves had
blue stitch, the gray parasol had a great
ruche of blue and gray and a lining of
blue. Every detail was complete and
beautifully carried out and naturally the
skirt's lining matched that of the jacket.
Very recently the Princess de Sagan
gave an elaborate and beautiful dinner
party in Paris, and naturally some of the
gowns worn were very pretty. In almost
every case the materials used were light
and the bodices were almost without ex
ception richly trimmed with lace. None
of the Bleeves were large. The materials
were principally gauze, tulle or muslin,
and there were some lace skirts over silk.
A charming dress was of soft silk, the
color of a rose petal ; on each seam was a
ruche of pinked-out tarlatane, the same
carried round the foot of the skirt and on
the corselet forming bretelles; elbow
sleeves of tarlatane over silk, fulled at the
seams and drawn in with a band of pink
moire. A dress of white tarlatane over
white silt was striped with Valenciennes
lace; the bodice trimmed V-sbape with
lace ; waistbelt and bows of soft cerise silk
draped round the waist.
Americans will be interested in learning
that at Deauville the Princess de Sagau has
been dethroned, socially, and the young
Count and Countess Castellane (nee Gould )
reign in her stead. Their yellow liveries
and attelage a la Danmont attract univer
sal attention. The Countess is said to act
in a winning and graceful manner. The
other day at the races she wore a dress of
a soft woolen material, the bodice of which
was covered with light lace, the same ar
ranged en quilles, and flounces on tne
skirt A wide belt of black faille and a
white straw bat with black and white
feathers completed her costume. On the
same occasion another fair Countess ap-
peared in a pretty light-blue foulard with
bodice and tablier of gathered Valen
ciennes lace over pale blue. A small
white straw hat covered vith roses and
leaves placed among the white tulle was
effective. The tulle also fell like a scarf
round her shoulders.
Some of the handsomest dresses will
{ consist of silk and woolen mixtures, the
i designs being after the style of velours
i cisele, viz. : uncut velvet, with the
I loops left. Generally these are bold in de-
I sign and a combination of two shades, one
helping to develop the other. In fancy
reps iB shown the basket weave in both
larpe and small patterns, and in all such
fabrics cords and shots prevail. Several
of the great French dressmakers are also
employing Scotch tweeds, which show
every variety of desisrn, and many diag
onal tweeds, having bread borders of a
distinct color and a shawl fringe, are con
sidered chic, as the gowns evolved from
them suggest the use of shawls.
Matelasse patterns of aU kinds are to be
largely employed, and the new vigogne in
light greens, blues, yellows, browns and
pinks, with self-designs upon them, either
of flowers or waved stripes, are pronounced
novelties. Young girls will select them
and look very pretty in them, and their
elders will use them for evening dresses.

Parisian
Hats and
Coiffure
In Paris the hair is being dressed much
higher than it has been for some time, the
knot being arranged almost upon the
summit of th head, and hats continue to
be worn tilted well over the eyes, as is
absolutely necessary with the present
style of coiffure.
The Parisienne very carefully considers
the relation of her hats and gowns; as a
result, she has for the present banished
the extreme hat and instead is ordering
toques and small hats, trimmed simply
bui with rare artistic skill. Fluted rib
bons bound with black velvet are the
newest of hat trimmings, and the white
and black ostrich feathers have taken the
place of flowers, the only exception being
made in favor of the red poppy, which is

A couple of them rolled near the chair of a

For overcoats dark browns and dark
blue cloths are still in favor and the
materials employed are either beaver or
cheviot. "Velvet collars are correct
There are but few novelties in under
wear. Ascots and four-in-hands are in
vogue, but the colors are dark. Some
haberdashers are showing black grounds
covered or sprinkled with red or green
figures.
New Yorkers have never countenanced
shirts with plaited bosoms; as a result
they are a complete failure and are selling
below the cost of production.
Fawn waistcoats are de mode; the
double-breasted ones only are occasion
ally worn with frock coats, but the single
breasted and the multi-colored ones
have been discarded by all smart
men. The swellest waistcoat now worn
(with a frock coat only) is the double
breasted white one; for evening wear the
double-breasted waistcoats of white duck
cut very low with only two buttons deep
and a very narrow collar around the
almost perfect M, are being worn by those
who set the fashions in such matters.
Frock coats are a trifle shorter this sea
son, as they extend only an inch and a
half below the knee and are loose in fit.
The three buttons are never fastened.
Him informs us that for the country an
English tailor has recommended a lounge
riding rig of a short, comfortable sack coat
of cheviot, black preferred; a waistcoat of
flannel with a small check of red and
black, and four flap pockets and breeches
of stout white drill. With this you may
either wear box-cloth gaiters or brown
tops. Another New York authority writes:
"The cloth which is said to be used for
lounge, morning or business suits this
autumn must therefore be as appropriate
for golf or wheeling as for the office or the
street. Tweeas and cheviots still lead,
the colors in favor being grays and browns,
and the ever-useful shepherd's plaid. In
London the browns have had their day
and the prevailing note in color is gray.
There have been already seen in this
country some very smart lounge suits made
of gray worsted. There is no change in
the shape of the sackcoat, which is as it
was last year, rather loose to the fagure.
The tiousers are ordinarily wide. The
official measurements are about nineteen
inches aiound the knee and about seven
teen and a half at the bottom.

| It Is the
Cavalier
The latest style in capes is called tna
"cavalier." It can be utilized for either
day or evening wear. One model is of
pink-striped velvet, with a plain cape of
pink watered moire below it. It is full in
the back and richly trimmed with ermine.
The pink velvet is striped with black. The
designer has sent home for day wear one
of gray cloth, with an overcape of gold
and brown velvet above with a chinchilla
collar.
Novelties are in the greatest demand as
the season nears its close, and we read that
"the real surprises have been bewitching
little collets, although no one expected
anything new or original could come from
that quarter, the fashion of them being in
its second year. The new ones are more a
part of the gownâ very gay â¢no* coquette.
One of these confections, of which there
were several worn at recent garden par
ties, was a veritable Marie Antoinette of
changeable blue and straw-color silk, with
two pinked-out bias ruffles arouna the
cape and one ruffle bordering the long
ends, which were tied in the back.
"Another in pink silk, shot with green,
was lovely and much the same model, but
trimmed with pink mousseline de soie
plisse in triple shoulder ruffles, and double
ones around the long ends."
Blue and white foulard that have been
quite the rage this spring in London have
not excited any enthusiasm here or at
Newport.
Vests of white kid, suede and glace, em
broidered with steel or silver, are being re
garded with favor. It is still an undecided
question as to whether fashion leaden
will regard favorably any radical altera
tions in the plain skirts, but plain flat
bands of trimming are almost certain to
be employed, and in London tailor-made
gowns will have numberless rows of stitch
ing at the hem. On other gowns narrow
braid, velvet or ribbon will be employed.
Paillettes will be as much used as ever,
but the shape and colorings will be more
beautiful than ever.
Shades and colors demand our most
serious consideration, for no matter how
stylish or well made the gown, if its color
emphasizes defects in the complexion or
makes the wearer have a purolish cast,
the dress is a failure. French women make
a regular study of what tones suit them
most perfectly, and each season nowa
days we have variations, an.l now I bear
that browns, grays and fawns will be pre
ferred to dark rich blues, greens or shades
of violet, but almost all of us feel a relief at
this announcement, as at so many stores
the display of purplish and bluish tones
during the last week have made me
firmly resolve to carefully avoid them.
Truly beautiful are the newest shades of
cigar brown and a deep pinky crimson, in
which there is to be detected a suspicion
of geranium, and cerise promises to be re
garded with great favor, and we must bo
i more careful than ever before to havo
everything about our toilettes either
match or harmonize perfectly; and thia
will not be such a serious undertaking as
heretofore, for all the leading houses are
importing the trimming, etc., that blend
with each pattern dress, and almost every
fashionable color can be found in the new
kids. Mabcella.

Great Warships
for the New Navy
Active work on the th^ee battle-ships
will now commence and $12,000,000 from
Uncle Sam's coffers will be distributed
among tne workingmen on the Atlantic
and Pacific seaboards during the next three
years. It is scarcely six years Bince the
contracts for the first three battle-ships
were signed ; these have been completed, a
fourth one will soon go into commission,
two are in course of construction and prep
arations are under way for three more,
. making eleven battle-sbips turned out
from our private shipyards in about nine
years.
While in point of number our armored
fleet is inferior to those of the larger naval
powers, the fact that they sre new vessels
and equal at least to the bast productions
abroad gives our small r.avy the advan
tage in not having to carry a dead load of
old csaft of doubtful utility, such as are
carried on foreign navy iists and many of
which inspire more terror by their names
than the ships tnemselves.
innce IS;6 about $130,000,000 has been
appropriated for the reconstruction cf the
navy, and tne benefits of tuis expenditure
have been Erenter than the average
citizen realises. It has raised the United
States from the bottom of the list of
. nÂ«val power* to the fifth in number and
- efficiency, and enabled this country to
back up its demands with a respectable
force ai sea, aud that alone is worth the
money expended. But tlie much greater
benefit derived has been the building up
of a great industry. Ten years ago there
was only one shipyard in the country
where a ship cf any considerable size
could be built; now there are a dozen,
of which four are capable of undertaking
battle-ship bui.ding. Ten years ago the
capacity of the largest rolling-mill in the
United States was only about 4-inch
Iron plates; now there are two armor
plants capable of turning out 13-inch
Harveyized steel plates. In 1886 we had
no gun founaries worthy of the name;
now the Government Kun-foundries at
Watervlipt and in Washington assemble
and finish guns from 16-inch caliber down
to 4-inch rifles from the forgings made at
Midvale, Bethlehem and other steel
â¢worts.
The capacity of all these yards, steel
plants and gun foundries is sufficiently
great to warrant the belief that they could
double the present navy in two years, for
they are all thoroughly equipped and have
thousands of experienced workmen to
draw on in case of emergency.
Another natural result of the growth of
the several industries connected with navy
material is that the cost has been consid
erably reduced, caused by competition and
experience in the work. The best steel
plates and shapes used in any country are
now produced at half the cost of ten yeafa
ago, wben much inferior material had to
be accepted. The cruisers of ISB6 could no
doubt be duplicated at tbe present time
for 20 per cent less than then, and in
battle-ship building there has been a drop
of nearly 22 per cent, although the re
quirements have become greater. The
following table shows the battle-ships built
or authorized to be built, year of contract,
, displacement, contract cost, exclusive of
V armor and armament, and the contract
cost per ton:

Comparing the cost of the Indiana with
that of No. 8 it will be noted that there is
a aecrease of nearly 22 per cent.. The bid
of the Newport News Company In 1895 on
No?. 5 and 6 was undoubtedly too low and
made without a full realization of what
the work really was, and the recent bid
by the same firm, showing an increase of
16 per cent on the bid of a year ago, indi
cates that there is now a better under
standing of naval work tnan in 1895.
As compared with the British battle
ship Jupiter of 14,900 tons the contract
cost is apparently 43 per cent greater at
Cramp's than in England, but with a
few more ships built in this country this
margin will decrease as our experience
grows. Tne contract price paid for the
Jupiter is $1,675,000 for hull, $452,165 for
machinery, $72,500 for erection of hydrau
lic eun machinery, making a total of
$2,199,665, or at the rate of $147 per ton
displacement It may be mentioned in
this connection that the armor for the
Jupiter â¢ is contracted for at ? 1,463,750,
whereas that for No. 5 or the Kearsarge
will cost $1,570,320. The weight of the
latter is 2821 tons, but as tbe weight of the
Jupiter's armor is not made public no
comparison of cost in this instance can be
made with approximate correctness.
Tbe three new battle-ships are combi
nations of the lowa and Kearsarge types,
with such improvements as have been de
cided most desirable. For the purpose of
comparisons the following table shows the

In the secondary battery the lowa and
Kearsarge carry twenty 6-pounders, which
in No. 7 has been reduced to seventeen.
The lowa and No. 7 carry also
four 1-pounders. The Kearsarge has
six, and the usual four machine guns com
pletes the battery of all three types.
It is in the substitution of rapid-firing
guns of 6-inch caliber that No. 7 shows a de

will be easier understood from tbe ap

The perforation of iron at muzzle ia cal
culated at 34.6 inches for the 13-inch gun
and 31.5 for the 12-inch, 24 inches for the
8-inch ana 15.6 for the 6-inch rifle. The
slight apparent advantage of 3 inches
which the 13-inch gun has over the 12
--inch is more than offset by the latter's
quicker service. Tbe Ordnance Bureau,
however, insisted upon the larger guns in
the Kearsarge, notwithstanding the chief
constructor's arguments to the contrary,
and thus while in every other navy the
largest guns are not over 12 inches, our
navy still carries an unnecessarily pon
derous gun, much heavitr by far than re
quired to penetrate any ship's armor.
Tho four 13-inch rifles on No. 7 are
mounted in pairs in two balanced Hich
born turrets. The turrets and barbettes
will be of Harveyized armor, fifteen inches
thick, augmented on the slanting faces by
two more.
These turrets of the cone shape are a
decided improvement upon the vertical
turrets hitherto used, as the slanting sides
virtually increase the horizontal thick
ness by a couple of inches, thus making
the turret armor nineteen inche?, against
thirteen inches in the lowa and Kear
sarge.
Of the 6-inch rifles two are placed on
each broadside within an armored citadel
six inches thick on the upper deck, eight
are on the main deck amidships behind
the casemate armor, and two will be
placed forward protected by six inches of
armor.
The armor will consist of a belt 16#
inches thick and 7 feet 6 inches in depth
at the water-line, extending four feet be
low water. This belt will go clear around
the ship, tapering to four inches at each
end. ifrom the top of this side belt up to
the upper deck the space occupied by the
main deck battery will be protected by
five and a half iuch armor, backed below
the main deck by copper dams with corn
pitch cellulose and bunkers full of coal.
Athwartship bulkheads twelve inches
thick will run inboard to tbe barbettes
from each end of the thickest part of the
siae armor, and on top of these four walls
there wiil be a flat protective deck two and
three-quarter inches thick. Below and
within this adequate protection thus
formed will be placed tne engines, boilers,
magazines and fehelirooms. Tne protec
tive deck wiil be three inches thick for
ward and four inches aft.
The engines will consist of two triple
expansion, each in its own water-tight
compartment, and there will be eight
large single-ended boilers, in four separate
compartments, to carry 180 pounds of
steam.
There will be four above-water torpedo
tubes, two on each broadside.
The Lone and Silent Watcher of the Ripening Harvest.
In the bulkheads and other divisions of
the Mill, where wood hitherto has been

No premiums for excess of speed are
offered, but a penalty of $25,000 on eacb
quarter knot is imposed for the first half
knot below the required contract speea.
The plans and specifications of theee
battle-snips were prepared by the Bureau

approval of the act authorizing their con
struction.
Tbe propelling machinery is calculated
to develop about 2000 more horsepower
than the Indiana, Massachusetts and
Oregon, and will probably exceed the
lowa, which is calculated at 11,000. There
will be two triple expansion engines, each
in its own water-tight compartment, with
cylinders of 35^, 51 and 78 inches in
diameter and a common stroke of 48
inches. The boilers, eight in number, will
be single-ended and placed in four water
tight compartments.
These boilers will have 685 grate sur

Out of Nothing, Nothing Comesâ True Greatness Is of Slow Growth
No one ever becomes suddenly great.
The world m^r suddenly discover great

thrust upon him in a moment the insignia
of rank among men. It has not made him
great, however, by this bestowal. It has
merely acknowledged the fact which ex
isted already in his nature.
"Out of nothing, nothing comes," is just
as true in the moral as in the material
world. As well might we expect a dead
bush to burst into blossom as an arid char
acter to put forth deeds of tenderness and
of beauty. The one, quite as truly as the
other, is an effect of a cause, and the law
which produces a certain result, and no
other, from that cause, is as inviolable as

Here Is a City Without Trees!
I rode uptown on a cable-car a few days
ago carrying a branch of madrona. The
fact does not sound particularly note
worthy, but there was one feature in con
nection with my carrying the branch that
surprised me greatly. That was the inter
est excited by my burden among my fel
low travelers.
One would have supposed my bit of a
characteristic Californian tree to be some
rare exotic, so curiously was it regarded.
Two ladies opposite me were evidently
discussing it. "Yes, it is the magnolia,"
one said; "you can tell by the leaves." A
gentleman next me examined the foliage,
fingering it curiously, and looked puzzled,
but said nothing. Another was bolder,
and, leaning forward, said tentatively,
"That is laurel, is it not?" I explained
that it was madrona, and a pleased mur
mur ran from lip to lip. ''It is very nice,"
commented my interrogator. "The tree
mu<-t be quite handsome."
It s â â Â» mcd a singular thing that among
s o many residents of California not one
recognized this, one of tbe earliest of Cali
fornian trees.
View of the Strange Indian Town on a Cliff 400 Feet High.
And yet the average San Franciscan can
hardly be blamed for not knowing by
eight the commonest trees. We have
been at most extraordinary pains to keep
every touch of grace and beauty from our
city streets, and it must be admitted that
our efforts have been very largely success
ful. The monotonous gray stretches of
our bay-windowed, wooden houses along
the monotonous gray stretches of our
life, often won and worn by veriest pre
tenders. They care only to seem great,
and are content to strut upon life's stage
in plumage not their own. Such persons
are usually saved the mortification of
realizing how apparent is their disguise
by the vanity which makes them seek it.
Dazzled by outward show they believe
that others, too, will never look behind
the mask of things, or measure their
reality by any standard higher than their
own. The world is full of these shams; so
full that shamming is a trade more profit
able to the self-seeking than is real merit
Though it may cost a struggle to wrest
the baubles from competitors, it is cer
tainly easier to fight on commonplace
levels than to reach untrodden heights
beyond the crowd. But when tne victory
is won it is only a cloak wherewith to
cover common things, not a light which
can transfigure them.
The greatness I refer to is of that true
kind which belongs to an individual by in
heritance from nature. It is a quality of
the soul. Position, or even recognition,
has nothing to do with it. As the sun
shines by its own lirht, and not because of
its position in tbe sky, so does the great
soul shed its power by reason of its own
nobility. It may have no rank among
men, yet it wiil outshine them aIL Its

other.

San Francisco will never have the ap
pearance of a city of homes until we are
wise enough to plant trees along our
Btreets and in our gardens. It is a curious
shortsightedness upon cur part that leads
us to devote time, money and patience to
the cultivation of palms and other semi
tropical trees upon our lawns, to the
neglect of the beautiful and characteristic
varieties that would add so much to the
interest and charm of our city.
What meaning or attractiveness is there
about the dreary rows of palms that bave
been set out along our water-front? The
planting of these trees is the crowning ab
surdity of the many that have signalized
Carrying Home the Harvest.
the "improvements" in that quarter.
Why should the city by the Golden Gate,
the chief entrepot of a region possessing
such distinct individuality and loveliness
as characterizes California's sylva, at
tempt to rival the scenic effects of every
seaside village in Kanakaland? Rows of
palms have a pleasing air of locality along
Waikiki beach and Hilo harbor. On tne
San Francisco water- front they have an
glory may be obscured because of the in
ability of others to perceive it, but its place
in nature is fixed by a law that is not con
cerned about the appearances of things.
It is great because it gives out greatness.
Its rank in nature is determined by its
power to bestow.
And is not this the truest of tests? We
may receive from others what is wholly
foreign to one's own nature, but we can
only give what we possess. A selfish man
may profit by another's generosity, but he
is careful to preserve himself. A weak
man may lean upon the strong, but he will
not be found supporting others. A little
soul may grasp at greatness, but it cannot
give grand powers or an ennobling inspir
ation. Truly we have only what we give,
paradoxical as the statement may seem.
To strive for self is therefore to prove the
poverty of our own souls. To give is the
birthright of the noble.
How, then, may true greatness be
achieved ? If we are weary of shamming,
if the cloak of power covers only the
nakedness of a slave, and the place of
honoris mocked by a discovery of our own
littleness, how may we escape from our
petty selves and become noble? Or are
we fated to remain forever mere empty
receivers of largess from greater natures?
It seems to me incontrovertible that

just about as truly indigenous as does
Cninatown. For the elms some raison
d'etre is apparent, but palms are a cheap
attempt to persuade the newcomer into
the belief that he has come to a tropical
climate. He soon finds out tbe contrary.
In the early days of our city's growth,
when it was deemed unsafe to build in
brick, the impression also prevailed that
we could not have trees on this windy
peninsula. How absurd is this notion,
and how much of charm its prevalence has
lost to the city, he may judge who will
make a trip along Taylor street, walking
northward from California. Here, for
nearly a block, stretches a row of joyous,
smiling maples, their tops stretching up
ward against the sky, their foliage making
pretty patterns on the walk and pavement
beneath. There is cure for homesickness
in that maple walk. It is worth climbing
a hi_:h hill and going some distance out of
one's way just to pass beneath that gra
cious greenery and fancy oneself to be
taking a leisurely stroll for pleasure, in
stead of hurrying along the naked, glaring

streets where nothing is met to divert us
from our feverish anxiety to keep up with
the procession.
It ought not to be so. There is no
reason why we should not have trees along
our streets, and trees that belong to our
landscape and are a part of our locality.
There are plenty of these, most of them
far more beautiful than the tropical trees

soul is self-bestowing. In this fact we
find quite plainly indicated the method
pursued in its unfoldment. And though,
wbeu stated as a law, we are at first in
clined to rebel against it, as if it were a
sophistry designed to rob us of ourselves,
it accords penectly with everyday experi
ence. When we live for others we enjoy a
wider life. When we forget ourselves we
belong to the greater world outside of self.
Religion expresses the same fact in bid

Uncanny People
admirably adapted for lawns, quick grow
growers and not too large, branching grace
fully and full of individual character.
The Western juniper, Lawson's cedar, the
Western yew and the California nutmeg
are among these. The last named is a
very lovely tree, growing to a height of
sixty or seventy feet, with slender, droop
ing branches and shining green leaves;
bark is a lovely light- brown, the new
branches in the spring-time gleaming
bright red through the foliage. Our yew,
too, has a delicate, feathery beauty,
stretching itself against the landscape
with trio lightest of penciled strokes. It
grows very straight and its foliage is thin
and delicate and an exquisite light-green.
Tho redwood grows slowly, yet I have
seen one planted in a garden attain a
noble growth in twenty years. They are
being destroyed so rapidly among the
hills that San Francisco should really
make an effort to secure a few along some
of our uptown thoroughfares, in order to
show the Californian mountaineers of
twenty years hence what tins majestic
tree is like.
Like most of our Californian trees, the
madrona is an evergreen, and no tree has
a more varied loveliness, save, perhaps,
the eucalyptus. There is something so
vital and vivid about this tree, with its
beauty of trunk and foliage aud blossom,
that it is a distinct event to come upon
one, even in a forest. You see it gleaming
like a jewel, through the pbalanxed
trunks, long ere you reach it, and you
never, for an instant, mistake it for any
other tree. Its oval, shining leaves, dark
green above and lighter beneath; its
smooth, beautiful trunk that one instinc
tively caresses: its graceful, free-growing
branches, and its bright red berries, make
up a form so beautiful at never to be for
gotten when once beheld. What a joy
they might be to the incoming traveler
thirty years hence had they been planted
along our water front.
Among the trees we have brought from
Australia the eucalyptus is by far the most
useful as well as the loveliest. The aca
cia, so much favored at first, is an unwhole
some tree despite its popularity, a notable
fever-breeder where it grows in any abund
ance. .But the eucalyptus has never had
half a chance in the city, and certainly no
tree ever had more detractors. They
should be planted upon some of our hilly
streets.
I was glad to note down in South Park
the other day how the city is redeeming
that once waste place. The grouna has
been turned over and aown and the
eucalyptus trees are already yielding
grateful returns in shade and beauty for
the brief care bestowed upon them. Less
than six months ago they drooped cheer
less and hopeless, mere shadows of trees.
Now they are vivid and vigorous and the
children playing in their shade may fairly
know them for trees. The birds have
found their way to them, and the once
draggled hopeless looking square is a place
of attractiveness ana pleasure. It will be
strange if this bit of green park in that
teeming district off Second street does not
yield rich returns in better citizenship.
Where it does not sink to the level of a
fad, as there is danger of letting it, the
growing sympathy of the race with na
ture is one of the most hopeful signs of
this time. It is a question whether lovers
of pnre politics and members of our good
government clubs might not find it
a profitable expenditure of energy to ac
complish making our city beautiful and
then put upon our youthful population
some of the responsibility of keeping it so.
At all events those of us who are in a posi
tion to do so might help the good work
by following the advice of the canny
Scotchman to his son, "An' Jock, when

Character or soul development this can
only mean that the soul enlarges Dy going
outward from its selfish center.
In every human soul there is a germ of
nobility. It may be altogether hidden
under selfishness, like a germ in the seed,
waiting for the impulse to break its shell
and enter upon conditions of growth.
This impulse will not come so long a 9 self
ish pleasures satisfy us, bui only when we
begin to share the joys ana sorrows of
others. Then comes the first taste of that
wider life in which tbe soul expands its
native power, growing in greatness by de
grees aa marked as are the stages of plant
development. There can be neither break
nor omission in the process. From the
point of selfhood to infinity the law of
expansion controls its evolving powers.
Therefore we may all become great when
we cease ;o be selfish. When life means
to us something more than the pursuit of
pleasure or the round of daily tasks the
pettiness of personal experience will be
come apparent. The larger life that
awaits us will seem more dpsirabie.

The strangest people living in the
United States are the Acoma Indians of
the Pueblo tribe, and they can with great
certainty claim the credit of) having the
straneest harvest ceremonies of any people
on earth. Little is really known of these
Indians, as their strange home in New
Mexico is far out of the beaten paths of
travel, and they seldom venture far from
it themselves.
Acorna is located about forty miles from
Fort Wingate, and the region around it is
wild and almost barren. The town itself
is on top of a cliff, or rather an enormous
bowlder, that rises 400 feet above the sur
rounding plain. The top of this is almost
inaccessible, and the Indians have only
two trails, both being exceedingly diffi
cult and dangerous. The Government
has sent several expeditions to Acoma,
but little has been found out about ihd
people, who look with disfavor on any
attempts to learn anything about certain
customs. They are a harmless and simple
tribe, but are much attached to the
traditions of the pat. In fact, they have
absolutely refused to give up their old
customs in spite of all persuasion.
It has never been possible to make the
Acomans re.al good Christians, although
they have embraced the faith and are al
ways glad to see a visiting priest. A
church was built for them over a hundred
years ago and is still standing. They are
perfectly willing to attend service, andi
most of them have been baptized, but
they will go directly from hearing mass to
some secret ceremony held in one of the
kivas or meeting-hails of the town. No
white man has ever seen one of these
ceremonies, and tbe chances are none ever
will.
Another strange thing is that the
people have no respect for the church as
an edifice. When it i 3 not being used for
service they see no reason why it cannot
be used for something else, and generally
have it full of sheep. But they never
molest the altar nor disturb any of the
articles used in the service. On one occa
sion a visiting priest forgot his prayer
book and was unable to go back for it. It
was two years before he got to Acoma
again, and there had been no other priest
visit the place in the meantime. He had
forgotten all about his prayer-book, but,
to his surprise, found it in tbe identical
place where he had left it when he last
used it.
Tue greater portion of the year Acoma
is like a dead city. Men who have re
mained there several days say that some
of the people will not leave their houses
for weeks at a time. The arrival of visitors
is all that will disturb them, and when a
party approaches the place they crowd
around the top of the cliff crying and ges
ticulating until they find out whether the
strangers intend to stop or not.
During the long winters the people Jfve
indoors, telling stories and playing differ
ent games. In spring they arouse enough
to allow the men to go to the fields some
distance away and put in seed. Then
there is another long interval of quiet un
til the crop is pretty well along and needs
watching.
To watch the crop is an honor, but he
who volunteers to do so is exempt from
work when the harvest time comes. It is
a dangerous job, though, as the watcher
has to live alone near the fields, while the
rest of the tribe is safa in the little city on
the cliff.
The Acomans do not harvest their crop
as it ripens, but allow it to remain in the
fields until everything else is ready to
harvest and then make one job of it all.
About the middle of September, generally,
the cnief gives tbe word and the town
wakes up. Where all was quiet and idle
ness the greatest activity prevails and ex
citement fills tbe people^
They act as if they had not expected a
crop and the first part of tneir ceremony
is to give thanss to the rain god. This
they do by heating different instruments,
building fires and singing. Several times
all the people march around the outsiJe
edge of the cliff and then begin the long
walk to the fieids, heavy with the harvest.
The harvest usually takes about ten
days, and in the meantime it is doubtful
if many of the people sleep a wink. All
night long they keep up their songs of
thanks to the rain god and the next day
start for the fields as soon as the sun rises.
Soii-e of the fieids are three miles away,
but all of the crop ia carried the entire
distance. The men do the digging of
potatoes and cutting of the grain and the
women carry it on their heads t j the hill
top. Great big bundles of chili peppers
and grain of different kinds are trans
ported across the sandy fields and up the
steep sides of the cliff, where it is de
posited in the harvest-house.
While the crop is being gathered the
very oldest women in the town are made
to work, and they go about their tasks
most unwillingly, because they have no
right to any of the harvest. They com
plain and refuse and are then beaten until
they get to work. They do not do as
much as the younger people, but it all
counts.
When at > last the crop is all in and the
granaries are filled with food for the lons
winter there is great rejoicing. And what
a lot of good things they do have ! There
is wheat, corn and barley and big piles of
potatoes. Tons of â  chili and dried toma
toes. Peaches and grapes are there in
plenty and also piles of onions and differ
ent herbs that give the meat such a fine
flavor;:;':^'' 'â 'â¢;â ',
When all is ready the crop is divided.
Everybody is there except the old women,
who have no right to any of it. The head
of each family gets a share according to
those he or she has to support. The
younger people and children are all given
certain quantities. When all is equally
divided each takes it to his home and
stores it where it can be easily reached.
The morning after the crop is divided
the queerest ceremony of the harvest
takes place. The old women who were
left out of the division had shutthem
se.ves in their houses all night, but before
doing so had carefully left large jars a few
leet from tbeir doors.
At daybreak the daughters, grand
daughters and great-granddaughters come
to the door and call. All carry .largo
jars filled with tne choicest of tbe harvest
and offer them to the old women. With
much ceremony the old women accept and
point to the jar in front of their doors, into
which the offerings aro dumped, and tbe
jars are carried inside by all oi the daugh
ters taking a hand.
The meaning of this part of the harvest
ceremonies has never been explained to a
white man.

THE YEAR 1901
What Has Happened Once
Will Occur Againâ The
Law of Cycles
Five Years From Next December the Sun
and the Planets Will Bear About the
Same Relation to the Earth
as in the Year of the
Great Deluge
The ancient Chaldean astronomer, Be
rosus, wrote twenty-two centuries ago of
the deluge and recited the positions of the
sun and major planets at tbe lime of the
cataclysm. Almost a similar position o;
these planets will occur in December,
1901, and many people are of the opinion
that some great cataclysm will then oc
cur.
What may we reasonably expect?
All human knowledge rests on bnman
experience. Ii it be proven that certain
terrestrial phenomena have occurred when
certain ultra-terrestrial conditions have ob
tained it requires no argument to indue
the belief that when similar conditions
again take place similar results may be
expected. No more, no less. Science, if it
deserves its name, must be absolutely true
and unbiased. The pedantry that disre
gards natural phenomena is not science.
The dictionary dehnes "cycle" as a
"uniformly returning occurrence of the
same event."
Just now, for some reason (that may
form the subject of future discussion), the
popular mind is much interested ;n eye ie
phenomena, and anything that offers ever
so slight a clew to tbe elucidation of the
mysterious working is eagerly accepted.
Probably ninety-nine out of every hun
dred human beings of average intelligence
have an inborn conviction that, what has
once happened will most likely happen
again. Asked why such ideas are enter
tained, the reply is, "I don't know." But,
all the same, the conviction is present.
Indefinite, vague, unexplainable, but â
existing.
The "cycle" is the expression of eter
nity. "\V itbout beginning or ending."
Modern science i:-, emphatically, mate
rialistic. It takes cognizance only of wha
pertains to the material universe and what
is susceptible of measurement by weight
and volume. The laws it recognizes apply
only to matter, and it confines its re-
Bffwches to the determination of material
causes, so that every effect is measured as
the result of a purely physical cause.
For convenience we divide science into
many branches, each pertaining to some
one specially, as "astronomical science,"
the "science of chemistry," etc. Natu
rally, there is a tendency due to such
division, to narrow the limits of research,
and consequently confine conclusions,
with the result that out of 10,000 specialist
investigators there arises but one philoso
pher.
The astronomer is, perhaps, the one
most inclined to search for the key to
cyclic phenomena. He witnesses the
evidence of cyclic law in all his investiga
tions. The simplest illustration of tbe
cycle is found in the motion of the earth
in her revolution around the sun. S leet
any point in the orbit of the earth, and at
the expiration of a period of time embrac
ing 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes and 47.6
seconds the earth will have completed
one revolution around the sun along the
path of her orbit, and will occupy a like
position in regard to the sun that she d d
at the beginning of the elapsed time above
mentioned.
In the computation of time use is made
of what are known as "cycles." The
Dominical cycle is for the purpose of de
termining the day of the week correspond
ing to any given date. If is found that at
the end of a term of 400 years ihe same
order of Dominical letters and days of the
week will return. A cycle of the sun de
termines the order of the Dominicai let
ters applying to the days of the ruonth
and lasts during a period of twenty -eight
years, when the same order returns. The
lunar cycle determines the times of occur
rence of the new moon and has the period
of nineteen years, at the expiration of
which begins another period of similar
length, the duplicate of its predecessors.
Astronomy declares that almost every
heavenly body is governed by cyclic law.
The motions of the plantts, their satel
lites, the so-called fixed stars (there are
no fixed stars; every star that, lor want
of a better expression, is cailed a "fixed
star," is, in fact, swiftly speeding through
space at a rate of motion calculated in
some instances to be a million miles an
hour, yet so distant from us that, though
a thousand years were expended in watch
ing, it would be impossible in that period
of time to detect any change in its posi
tion), and airo the motions of some
comets, are in cycles that have been deter
mined by us.
Because we have been unable to measure
the orbit of each comet is no reason that
we should say that any is exempt from
cyclic law. The vastness of the orbit may
exceed our finite comprehension, yet it is
an orbit.
Coming closer to home we observe many
manifestations of cyclic power. In mat
ters of disease and health the physician is
well aware of the lorce of cyclic law.
Fevers are distinguished by the periodic
ity of their recurrence. Some physiolo
gists declare that every seven years our
material bodies are renewed. That is,
tb* process of eliminating effete animal
mater and the supplying of its place with
new is gradually and constantly going on,
so that at the end of tbe period of seven
years our physical organism contains
nothing that formed it seven years pre
viously.
It would be strange if with such forcible
evidence b- fore ua, our brains were unten
anted with the belief that past occur
rences would be reduplicated. It will not
do to relegate such imaginings to the
land of myths and say such thoughts are
nonsensical. Education and culture have
not, nor will they ever, expurge such
thoughts. The greater application the
student bestows upon the phenomena of
nature the more pronounced appears the
truth ot the cyclic law.
The development of intelligence but
whets Hie appetite for knowledge. Tbe
more we know the more we want to know,
and Uiere is growing to-day an intense
desire to learn what cycles are determin
able, what particu ar occurrences mark
the epochs and the probable times of tbe
happenings. In other words, there is a
strong tendency to break away irom the
strict materialism of science, as science is
interpreted, to leap, so to speak, irom the
rock of exact science and take a header in
tbe inviting surf rolling in from the sea of
speculation.
Science itself is not to blame for this
condition. But some of its exponents are.
In ministering to greed, the application
of practical science has occupied their
time and attention to the exclusion of
wnat is pure science, which seems, in too
many instances, not only to be ignored,
but forgotten.
The cyclic law is the "law of unrest."
Everywhere the arrangement of matter is
varying. The movements among differ
ent portions, be the masses great or small,
are constantly changing both in direction
and rate. Look upon the sky at night
time. Hither and thither suns and satel
lites are rushing with motions varying ac
cording to the attractive forces of other
suns and other satellites encountered by
each orb at various portions of its course.
Alike in those vast bodies of cosmical
dust; alike in the fantastic folds of those
enigmatical, vaporous masses of 3telJar
space, and in ail that sense is cognizant of,
is lound the evidence of unrest. Trace
downward in the oraer of size from these
mighty masses of the sky, through all the
intermediate shapes and forms of matter,
until is reached the smallest atom wiihin
the range of conceivable vision. Among
all, in all, ruling all, in general and in de
tail, permeating the universe, there is an
unceasing redistribution of matter and un
ceasing chan c of motion. Birth and death
are ever side by side. The action iscvclic.
From the utmost limits of the undenna
ble space come particles of matter, drawn
toward a common center by the unknown
power. They coalesce to form a mass, the
motion of each particle diminishing with
the formation of the ag regation. Inte
gration compensating the dissipation of
motion. So were the stars born.
Outward, toward unending limits rush
other panicles, departing from some ag
gregation undergoing disruption, in
obedience to some unknown force. Disin
te ration metamorphosing into motion.
So die the stars.
Fom out, beyond, come particles of
matter, imponderable, immeasurable by
the most delicate mechanical appliance,
but nevertheless matter. For inconceiva
ble lengths of time the process of gathering
goes on, the converging streams at last
forming what vision recognizes as a dimly
outlined, almost impalpable mist. Men
come and go, the history of one race and
a^e becomes ancient, molders and is for
gotten. Millions upon millions of years
succeed each other, and the beginning
lapses into the unknown; and then some
eye views a dusty cloud where the mist was.
The timepiece ol eternity marks the
passing of the seconds of creation's hours
with steady swing of pendulum, whose
mighty sweep is all too ponderous for
human recogn.tion. The dusty fog has
coudensed into a nebulous mass. Thus
onward with steady growth, so gradual
that finite sense is too short-lived, and
human history too brief to record a
change, the aggregation advances to its
coherence. At some period ot such a for
mation our eyes may rest upon the then
stage of growth and view the faint, misty
cloud or tbe nebulous crust, or the
splendor of the blazing sun. Every orb
shining with inherent light was thus
born.
This process of integration goes on
until a certain point is reached. It mu3t
not be supposed, however, that tbe cul
mination may be recognized by our feebie
comprehension of time, but there is a time
when the motion of aggregation attains
its highest development â that instant
when the power of aggregation is exactly
balanced by the power of segregation.
Thenceforward disintegration takes place.
In obedience lo the same law of unrest,
ihe cyclic law that sped each particle
toward a common center, the aggregated
mass was in motion from tbe instant of
its conception. Each arriving particle
transferred its direct motion to the gen
eral aggregation, all these direct motions,
arriving from all conceivable directions,
compounding to form a rotary motion of
tbe mass thus aggregated.
Coexistent with such rotary motion is
the tendency to disrupt. With the in
crease of density of the mass the speed of
rotation increases and with it the power of
disruption grows until a condition is
reached where centrifugal force is stronger
than the cohesive qua.Uies of the mass,
when from the spinning mass are thrown
off partic.'es of matter, whose tendency to
depart further is arrested by the attractive
force of the central mass at the distance
where the energy of expulsion becomes
expended and whera the rotary force of
disintegration is balanced by the direct i
force of integration. (I say "particle" ; I
do not mean that large masses are thus
thrown off.) Henceforward each particle
assumes an orbital motion, the many
particles forming a zone or ring, encir
cling and revolving around the parent
mass.
Gradually the articles forming the zone
coalesce and in time a mass is formed
which retains the orbital motion. This
expulsion, or throwing off of particles,
goes on until the reduction in size of the
parent mass gradually reduces the velocity
of rotation, and thus weakens and finally
ends iis destructive tendencies. With loss
of revolutionary motion comes loss of
heat and consequent Jailing power of co
hesion. Not speedily, as measured by
finite cognizance of time, but yet surely
and Ftendily, with imperceptible grada
tion each riant of the universe fades and j
dissolves back into tbe imponderability
whence it came. Such is the birth,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1896.
such '.8 the death of every stellar system!
With the inception of birth is compassed
the beginning of death.
The effect of motion upon matter iÂ« the
expression of cyclic law. It may be thusly
formulated: Matter proceeding along a
right line (i. c., direct line) is creative,
Matter departing from a right line (i. c.,
curved, rotary, circular) is dectructive.
To descend, so to speak, to phenomena
near to vs â the events transpiring upon
our own globe and witnin the scope of our
own experience â the same cycling Jaw of
unrest, of unceasing change, is manifest.
In the development of civilization is ob
served the formation of colonies by indi
viduals coming from all portions of the
older countries to people the new; the
groups thus formed at the port of departure
coalescing upon the new continent. We
have thus a segregation of matter as
resulting from direct motion as regards
the oil nation; a;id, an aggregation of
matter dissipating motion as regards the
new nation. There is with all this yet
another illustration of th? universal cyclic
law. In addition to change of direction
there is also change of form. In every
change from an inherent to a coherent
stale â i. c., from a more or less scattered
condition of matter to a mass forming a
simple aggregate, the different portions of
aggregating matter cause varieties of con
dition in the mass formed. No absolutely
uniform process of aggregation bas ever
been or ever can take place. The varie

in Mariposa the acre of the long torn,

passed away forever. The eaMly won gold
from the beds, bars and banks cf the

the more serious work of attacking the
parent sources from which that gold came
is now the order of tbe day. Quartz
mines are being opened up in every direc
tion, and with the systematic work that is
necessary in gold quartz mining has arisen
the demand for cheap motive power.
A few days ago the Mariposa Electric
Power Company was incorporated under
the laws of the State of California. Its
capital stock is $1,000,000, divided into
100,000 shares of $10 e*ch. The president
of the company is Captain A. H. Ward of
the Pinon Blanco mine, near Conlterville;
vice-president, Charles T. Lindner, elec

retary is George L. Ecker. The other di
rectors are Wallace B Taylor and Harold
C. Ward of the Nevada Metallurgical

In addition to its capital stock the com

amount of about $500,000 for construction,
and operations are now in progress.
The romantic interest in all tales of the I
submerged continent, Atlantis, i s as reat
to-day as it ever was, and, curiously enough,
what was once regarded as pure romance
is now, in many quarters, regarded as
historical truth. Many have thought that
Plato's tales of Atlantis were fiction or at
least legendary. But now the iid<? has
turned and civilization itself 3eems to be
turnirrg back for light to the old masters,
and many things the western world used
to think it had grown p&st are now com
ing back as truths. In view of nil this it
is interesting to recount some of the
proofs that are now offered in support of
the belief that Poseiaon was a reality and
that once a wonderfully developed race of
human beings inhabited an enormous
continent in tne Atlantic Oc.an, longsince
submerged.
Ignatius Donnelly devotes much time
and care to the presentation of testimony
bÂ« has gathered respecting the location of j
tbe fra.m^nt, if not ihe whole continent
Atlantis. First is the testimony of the
sea, baaed upon the soundings of the
United States &hip Dolphin, the German
frigate Gazelle and the British ships
Hydra, Porcupine and Challenger, which
have mapped out the bottom of the At
lantic Ocean, showing a great elevation,
reaching from a point, on tbe coast of the
British Islands southerly to the coast of I
South America, at Cape Orange, thence
southeasterly to the coast of Africa and
thence southerly to Tristan d'Acunha.
The various deluges are then taken up
ami the civilization of the Old and New |
worlds contrasted, together with the com
plexion of the races. Evidence of Ameri
can intercourse with Europe and Atlantis,
traces of Atlantis in Genesis, the origin of
the alphabet in Atlantis, artificial de
formation of the skull, the pyramids, the
cross and other structures the product of
the Atlantean, all are dwelt upon and |
handled in a masterly manner, and all j
proving Atlantis as the center from which j
they radiated. Colonies from Atlantis i
entered Central America and Mexico, the
Mississippi Valley, Egypt. Peru, Africa
â¢and Ireland, along the banks of the Ania- i
zon and the Aryan settlements. Many if
not all of our grtat inventions were de
veloped ia Atlantis, and we are merely
rediscovering.
iies beginning at the inception of the
aggregation become more and more
marked as the proceso progresses, the less
heterogeneous is transformed into the j^; ore
heterogeneous. Homogeneity bas notice
in the universe. The word is a synonym
for annihilation.
In life, as we know it, definite varieties
take their origin in minute differences of
conditions and surroundings. In each of
the various races, animal and vegetable,
the various genera become distinct.
Never were seen two human beings alike
in all particulars. Never were seen two
trees, one the duplicate of the other.
Never were seen two leaves exactly alike.
In the formation of nations from the va
rious races of men the characteristics
distinguishing the one nation from the
other grow with the nation, and we recog
nize the nationality of the individual with
greater or less readiness of perception as
the nation producing him is old or new.
Again, in the nation itself arise class dis
tinctions that become more prominent aa
time progresses; each class becomes sub
divided into minor classes, each char
acteristically differing one from the
other, and extending to tbe family
group between the individual members
of which are marked distinctions. The
tendencies of all the subdivisions and
multiplications of diversities is toward
equilibrium of the forces of which ail
parts of an aggregation are exposed, and

Mr. Donnelly writes:
If our knowledge of Atlantis was more
thorough it would no doubl appear that in
evory instance wherein the people of Europe
accord with the paopie of America they'were
botti in accord with the Deopie of Atlantis. It
will be seen in every case where Plato gives
us information in this respect as to Atlantis
we find tbis agreement to exist. It existed in
architecture, sculpture, navigation, engrav
ing, writing, an established priesthood, the
mode of warship, agricnUure, and the con
struction of r< ads and canals; and it is rea
sonable to suppose that the same correspond
ence extended down to all tho minor details.
Processor Huxley said in 1880:
There is nothing, so far as I am aware, in the
biological or geological evidence at pro-ent
accessible to renaer untenable the hypothesis
that an area of the mid-Atlantic or Pacific
seabed as big as Europe should have been up
lifted as high as Mount Blanc and have sub
sided a?ain, any time since the palsezoic
epoch, if there were any grounds for enter
taining it
Donnelly writes:
We are but! beginning to understand the
past; one hundred years ago the world knew
nothing of Pompeii and Hercuianeum; noth
ing of ttie linifual tie that bind- together tbe
Indo-European nations; nothing of the sg
nificance ol the rÂ»at volumes of inscriptions
on the tombs and temple!) of Egyp* ; nothing
of the meaning of tho. arrow-beaded inscrip
tions cl Babylon; nothing of ihe marvelous
civiiiza:io is revealed in the remains of Yuca
tan, Ajex'co and Peru. We are on the thresh
old. Scientific investigation is advancing
with giant strides. Who shall scy that one
huii'ired years from now the great museums
of the wcrld may not be adorned with gems,
statues, arms and implements from Atlantis,
while the libraries of the world shall contain
them. When the moment arrives that
such equilibrium is attained, growth ends
and dec;iy begins. Be it star or nation, it
ia the same. It is the tendency of a:l that
is to, at some time, reach uniformity as
the result of the subdivision and distribu
tion of energy. It is the. law. Such uni
formity is what we call death. Yet after
death comp processes of renewed life, dif
fering from the former life â but actual
life. The cycle has no end.
The mighty systems of space, aggregated
from tbe invisible atoms, must in the
course of time eqmlibrate their energies
with their surroundings, thenceforward
yieldin<-' to the process of disintegration,
the beginning and the ending of the sys
tem compassing periods of time immeae
uraole by finite comprehension. Yet of
such mighty masses thus disintegrating,
no particle of matter but what, when libe
rated from the aggregation by dissolution,
speeds swiftly in direct line to aid the 'or
mation of some new aggregation. The
great cyclic law, the rhythm of "death
from life, from death to li c," was, is and
ever will bs. In the stellar orb, in the
tiniest atom, in the nation, in tbe indi
vidual,-the same cosmual law, the law of
the cycle exists, governing all.
What that is which, itself unchanging,
eternally produces change is beyond the
ken of human science â it is not for finite
comprehension. It is the unknown power
transcen> ing all human knowledge or con
ception. It is illimitable â without meas
of $700, or over $8000 a year, in itself a
comfortable dividend on a mine that is
not over-capitalized. In addition, there
is the saving in many other ways. There
are no tires to be monkeyed with in shut
ting down or getting up steam. T.tero
are no firemen's wnges, and at small ex
pense the interior workings of a mine can
be lighted as well as the streets of San
Francisco ought to be lit after dark.
The power by which the Mariposa Elec

Mills will be operated is the water of the
Merced River, taken from a point about
eight miles higher up, and known as the
Broadhea-i o.'d dam. Here the Merced
River Canyon narrows in and forms a sort
of natural dam. Thence the water will be
taken by ditch and Hume eight miles to
the power-house. It is estimated that at
the dryest seasons there is at least 10,000
miners' inches of water available, ami the
fall is a ciear 225 tret. This is sufficient to
generate 6000 horsepower in the dryest time
of the year, while at other times, when
the snow-water 3 from the upper Sierras
are in the river, there is no limit to the
capacity. The location of the Mariposa

Until very recent years modern science
made no distinction between Lemuria
and Atlantis, but since the appearance of
Donnelly's book there is a disposition to
be mote accurate.
An empire which reached from the
Andes to Hindostan, if not to China, mu3t
have been magnificent, Indeed, and the
more we learn of th.s mighty drowned
nation tbe more is our priae in nineteenth
century achievement wounded.
Portions of Atlantis lie but a few hun
dred fathoms beneath the Atlantic Ocean;
"and if expeditions have been sent out
from time to time in the past to resurrect
from the depths of the sea sunken
treasure-ships with a few thousand doub
loons Hidden in their cabins, why should
not an attempt be made to reach the
buried wonders of Atlantis? A single
engraved tablet dredged from Plato's
inland would be worth more to science,
would more strike th* imagination of
mankind, than all the gold of Peru, all the
monuments of Egypt and all the terra
cotta frngments from the great libraries of
Chaidea."
It is millions of years since Atlantis
first rose from the sea, but it is only
11,000 years since the island, opposite tho
mouth of tbe Mediterranean, of which
Homer sang and Piato taught, was
drowned.
Ancient classical literature is full of
reference to this great country. Its posi
tion and its magnitude were committed to
ure or compass. Neither has it beginning
nor ending. It is the cyclic law.
It is apparent that all tbe phenomena of
life is obrdient to the operation of evelic
law. Yet how few people recognize such
fact. To the great majority the mention
of the word "cycle" calls up a host of
speculative fears. It is by the ignorant
associated with the foreshadow of coming
calamity, and is by them believed to be "a
cause ori -inating outside of the earth pro
ducing effects in and upon the earth."
Thfre can always be found some grains
of truth in the popular rumor. General
beiiefs do not rest altogether upon false

be. The sun-pots that mart the face of
the sun increase and diminish in numbers
and size with periodical regularity, cover

disturbances always occur upon ihe globe
with greater force at the time of tbe
maxima of sun spots. The giant planets,
Jupiter and Saturn, reach certain positions
with regard to the earth in periods cf
twelve and twenty-eight years, and so far
back as the records extend it is shown
that earthquakes occur more frequently at
the times when these great planets attain
such positions The stream of meteors
which the earth passes through every
November is richer in one portion than in
another and the revolution of the meteoric
ring brines the richer portion in the
earth's pathway every thirty-three years.

the kee> ing of prose-writing, while the
deeds and misdeeds of the ra es have
been preserved in verse. Herodotus
recordei the facJsof Atlantis; Pliny wrote
j of it; even Plutarch refers to it, and there
are many other so-called profane writers
who have helped to keep its memory
green. Even the night of the dark ages
was not sufficient to dim its luster. But
above all other writers, outside of tne
wisdom-religion records of the East, Plato |
stands out conspicuously as the fountain
head, the source of information concern
ing the continent and its mighty people.
But even Plato has left us but a fragment.
His story stop 9 abruptly, over which
fact the whole literary world has mourned
from the time of the wise Greek to the
present day. Plato attributes his knowl
edge of Atlantis to the Egyptian priests
of Sfcis, who pomrmiriica-ed the facts to
Solon, a relative of Plato, and from Solon,
the great law-giver, the knowledge de
scended to tbe jape Plato. There is reason
lo believe, however, that this was simply
a device resorted to by Plato to screen his
own knowledge and wisdom, as it was
dangerous to give out too much in his
time, except under cloak of fable, allegory
or alleged tradition. It seems, too, that
Plato purposely confounded the island, or
the last so-called remnant of Atlantis,
with the great continent itself.
Plato was a student or pupil of the wise
Egyptians, who doubtless obtained their
knowledge by direct succession from tbe
Atlanteans, whose descendants they were,
and "had not Diocletian burned the
esoteric works of the Egyptians in 296,
together wi h their books on alchemy;
Caesar 700.000 rolls at Alexandria, Leo
Isaurus 300.000 at Constantinople, and the
Mohammedans all they could lay their
sacrilegious hands upon," the world mieht
know more to-day of Atlantis than it
does.
Tbe whole East firmly believes in the
existence and high civilization of the At
lanteans. which civilization was much
greater than (hat of the Egyptians. It is
the degenerate descendants of these A-
Janteano who built tbe first i yram ds in
tbe country. Concerning the pyramid*,
it is stated that "'there are subterr^nran
passages and winding retreats, w Ich men
I skillful in ancient mysteries, by means of
which they divined the coming of a flood,
constructed in diff rent piaces lest the
memory of all their sacred ceremonies
should be lost." Tbtsfl men who divined
the coming of the rloo.is were not Egyp
tians, who never had any floods, except the
per.odical rising ot the Nile. They were
rather the last remnants of the Atlan
teansâthose race-< w ich science is begin
ning to believe lived and breathed bef re
the so-called historic period. Charles
Gould, the well-known geologist, ?ays:
' Can we suppose thnt we have at all ex
hausted ttie ?reat mu-eum o' nature? Have
we, in fact, penetrated yet beyond iis ante
chambers? Does the written history of man.
comprising a few thousmd years, embrace the
wiiole course of his intelligent existence? Or
have we in the long mythical era, extending
over hundreds of thousands of years ana re
corded on tbe chronologies of Chsldea and of
China, shadowy mementos of prehistoric man,
handed down by tradition and perhaps trans
ported by a few survivors to existing Innds
from others, wtiieh 1 ke tbe fabled (?i Atlantis
of Plato, may have been submerged, or the
scene of some joint catastrophe, which de
stroyed them all with their civilization?
Modern research and effort have gone
far to demonstrate the truth of Plato's
siatements. and many are tho scientific
writers who have added something to a
c carer understanding of Atlantis; yet
there are s< me who are skeptical or luke
warm concerning the facts. But if one
will take the time to ca-efully go over the
facts and mass of proofs presented by Mr.
Donnelly in his book entitled "Atlantis:
The Antediluvian World," be can scarcely
remain in doubt about the existence or
rise and fall of Ailantis. In the present
sketch one can do lUtle more than point
out the mos>t important facts as gleaned
from various sources concerning the an
cient world thai now lies buried beneath
the Atlantic Ocean. Tho!<e who are in
terested in the small Atlantic island, its
divisions into land and water, the places,
the temples, the statues of gold, the foun
tains, and springs, and baths, should read
Plato's description:
The military and naval establishments,
the race courses and docks, theeardensand
streets ali come in for a share in the de
scription. The whole country was stated
to be "very lofty and precipitous on the
side of the sea. but the country imme
diately about and surrounding the city
waÂ«Â» a level plane, itself surrounded by
mountain chains. * * â¢ And the place
was smooth and level and of oblong shape,
lying north and south, 3000 stadia in one
direction and 2000 in t c other. * * *
They surrounded the plain by an enor
mous canal or dike, 101 feet deep, 606 feet
broad and 1250 miles in length."
In other places Plato gives the entire
size of the island of Poseidonis as about
tbe same as that assigned above to the
plain around the city alone. It seems
then that one statement refers to the
great continent and the other to the small
remnant â Plato's island.
The standing army of Atlantis is given
as upward of 1,000.000 men; its navy as
1200 ships and 240,000 men. Such state
ments are not applicable to a small island
state of about the size of Ireland. Con
cerning the people, he says:
For many generations, as long as the divine
nature lasted in them, they were obedient to
the laws. They possessed true and in every
way ereat spirits, practicing gentleness and
wisdom. They despised everything but virtue,
and thinking lightly on the possession of gold
and other property, they were not intoxicated
by luxury nor did wealth deprive them of
their self-control. â¢ â¢ â¢ But when the
divine nature began to fade and became
diluted with too much of the mortal mixture,
they being unable to bear their fortunes, be
came unseemly, losing their fairest and most
precious gifts. Then a most honorable race
becoming wretched, retribution follows.
The early Atlanteans, we are told, were,
like the Lemurians, from whom they de
sceiided, giants, but smaller than the early,
third race, Cyclops. It is probable that the
Atianteans were early twenty-seven feet high
and eight feet across tbe shoulders, but they
gradually diminished in size.
The term "Atlantean" must not mislead the
reader to regard them as one race only or
even a nation. It is as though one said
"Asiatics." Many, multityped and various
were the Atlanteans, who represented several
humanities and almost a countless number of
races and nations, more varied, indeed, than
would be the Europeans were their name to
be given indiscriminately to the five now ex
isting parts of the world. There were brown,
red, yellow, white and black Atlanteans.
giants and dwarfs (as some Airican tribes art
even now).
It is from the Atlanteans that tbe early
Aryans got their knowledge of "the
bundle of wonderful things" mentioned
in the Mababbarata. It is from them that
they learned aeronautics (the knowledge
of flying in air vehicles), and therefore
their great arts of meteorograpby and me
teorology. It ia from them that they in
herited their most valuable science of the
bidden existence of precious and other
stones; of chemistry, or rather alchemy,
of mineralogy, geology, physics and as
tronomy.
It is stated that the Atlanteans learned
the secret and hidden laws of nature, and
"the more evil among them used or mis
used their knowledge for base purposes.
It is even claimed that they had obtained
the keys to some of the most arcane laws
of magnetism and electricity, to which
the X ray is as child's play. They may
even have known of that most myste noaa
force called "vril" Dy Bulwer.
in fact, their knowledge bad risen to
such a height that they were virtually
gods, until some of them, by prostituting
their powers to unworthy ends, became
sorcerers and demons. Tnen comes the
record of wars, bloodshed and ruin, cul
minating in a great catastrophe, and the
sinking of tbe continent, the elect of thÂ«
cations seekin-i other lands.
It is of this cataclysm, the submersion
of the great continent of Atlantis, that the
old records say that "the ends of the earth
got loose," and upon this catastrophe have
been based the legends and allegories of
Vaivasvota and Noah. Tradition, taking
into no account the differences between
sidereal and geological phenomena, calli
botn, indifferently, "deluges." Yet there
is, in truth, a great difference. Subter
ranean convulsions destroyed Lemuria,
but the end of AtlantiÃ was brought about
by disturbances or shiftine oi the earth's
axis of rotation.
It began during the earliest tertiary
periods, and, continuing for long apes,
carried away successively the last vestige
of Atlantis, with the exception perhaps of
Ceylon and a small oortion of what is now
Africa. It changed the face of the globe,
and no memory of its flourishing conti
nents and isles, of its civilizations and
sciences, remained in the annalsof history,
save in the sacred records of the East.
It was several millions of years ago that

that is during the miocene p rlod, but it
was 850,000 years ago that i:s famous
islands ol Rvita and Daitya were destroyed,

"When I was a little boy going to school
I used toâ"
Those were the words I heard the other
day as I was hurrying down the street,
and then a hearty laugh greeted my ears.
Turning, in spite of my rush, I saw two
old gray-haired men earnestly engaged in
conversation.
How their eye; sparkled! How the
sweet smiles chased all footprints of time
and care irom the faces of those "long-ago
school boys," as they, on a busy street of
a great city, recalled many a prank and
caper on some far-away village street in
the days of "long ago."
Of course I commenced to thinkâ of
you? Certainly, and these were my
thoughts: Here you are, the boys and
girls of to-day, all of you having such a
lovely time with so many grand opportun
ities; may you all when you, too, are old
and gray be able to recall with pleasure
the golden hours of this precious time.
Of all the changes of the year,
Complete from birth to rest,
This rosy, russet, golden change-
Octoberâ is the best.
Be glad, O man! for it is here,
Earnest Vnd hopeful,
Children, dear;
Ripe is the year, and blest.
Not a bit drear or melancholy are the
days. No, our October is full of richuess
and ripeness, is laden with grains and
fruits, ana the air is filled with sunshine
and song of bird, with rustle of leaf and
fall of nut.
But may we in this lovely clime not for
get our brothers on the far away, storm

many, many loved ones have been swept

October is the tenth month of the year,
but formerly was the eighth, hence its
name.

In another moment Will was able to get

eyes glittering in the tree.
As soon as he felt the weapon in his fin

of the room and aimed toward the man in
the apple branches, as well as one coula
take aim in the dark.
"It won't go offr said Ruth tremu
lously. "It hasn't any trigger!"
"Well, he don't know that!" replied
Will contemptuously, still pointing
through the window, and relieving his
fatigue by (shifting the pistol from one
hand to the other. "He'll. only think
we've got the drop on him. Now, you just
watch how quick those footsteps are going
to halt out there !"
At this very moment One-legged Mike
seemed to stumble on the short steps lead

He climbed them painfully, hobble-de
hoy fashion, and then paused, as if medi

?*c boldness of the burglar's move

No fear of attack or alarm seemed to in
timidate him.

silence of this last move*
Presently came a sort of sneeze, as it
were at the very keyhole 1
Another silence.
A restless shifting about of feet, as if

uncomfortable.
They held their breath, and Will, in his
distracted effort to aim first at the window
and then at the door, finished by pointing
straight at the furthest corner of the room.
CHILDHOOD'S
REALM.
Sara Lou noiselessly laid a log on the
fire.
Some time passed without another sound
from the man outside.
Ruth had frightful visions of drills and
jimmies, and all the rest of the instru
ments that every well-regulated robber
carries round in a leather bag !
Momentarily she expected to see the
door fly open, as if by maeic, and a burly
one-legged man in a mask enter the room.
But the quiet remained undisturbed. It
became even more alarming than the
tramp of the unsteady footsteps.
As they waited in hushed expectation
they were startled by a deep sigh, a sort of
moan, and the burglar fell against the
door and slid to the floor with a tremen
dous thump.
The children's eyes fixed in a fascinated
stare on the thin panels.
They creaked, but did not give.
No further sound reached their ears.
The rest of the night passed in intervals
of dozing and startled awakeninar, but
through it all the prostrate figure on the
other side of the door made no signs of
life.
The watchers shivered and longed for
daylight.
When the cheerful sunshine gave them
courage to sally forth at last they found
against the lintel his gray beard, as long
as a Druid priest's, and his legs stretched
out to benefit by the heat of the morning
sun â W. Capricomus!
He blinked his eye knowingly as they
crowded around him, and maintained his
attitude of beautiful composure and un
concern.
"I knowed dat Billy gwine do sump'n

when we wuz comin' en dish hyar school

Lou, advancing to the attack, brandishing
a small loe of wood.
The others followed her example, and
fell upon him with rulers, Indian clubs
and dumbbells, like an avalanche, until
he betook himself to ignominious retreat
at once, undignified and out of keeping
with his venerable looks.
The Thomsons were long forgetting
that midnight experience, and cherished
such a grudge against W. Capricomus for
bis sinister joke, which they considered
a willful piece of mischief, just in charac
ter with his reputation, that they publicly
celebrated his death, some months later,
from an indigestion caused by CJaude's
indiarubber football.

By OliVe Heyderv
WHERE WE PUT FUMY.
You may remember that I told you our
back yard was full of flowers. I liked
Pappy very much, but I liked my flowers
too, so I proposed to George that we get a
long chain and tie the little fellow by the
basement door. Then he could play a
little way out in the yard and in part of
the basement So we did. We turned a
barrel on its side to make a little house,
with an old fur rug for a bed.
He did look so cunning sitting up in his
house looking out..
For three days he was quite content, as
quiet as a mouse.
Alice and I spoiled him. We would go
down and pet and cuddle him and very
soon he began to cry when we left him
alone. Then he made up his mind lhat a
chain was a horrid thine, and how he did
pull and strain and growl at it.
And howl! Why the howl was bigger
than the dog.
George said to let him howl till he found
it was ho use. That was easy for George
to say when he was away most of the time,
but it wasn't very easy for us who had to
listen to it all day long.
I had set my wits at work to find some
way to let the dog loose and still save the
flowers, and finally hit oa a plan. There
was a narrow strip of yard on the side
where the back steps went down ; I thought
I'd fence that off, keep the back door
of the basement shut, leave the side door
open, and the puppy could run in the lit
tle yard and all through the basement.
We fixed it that way, and Mr. Puppy
was free to run and be as happy a wee
doggie as you ever saw.

'Bessie," exclaimed May, "i wonder
who's coming! Do go and see; there's a
dear!"
Scarcely had the words left her mouth
when tramp, tramp, tramp came the
sound of feet upon the gravel walk. Such
a noise and confusion ensued, and "Isn't
it a lovely day?" "The Haunted Castle!"
"Now, do come; won't you?" were the
exclamations uttered by the young people
who gathered around the two girls.
Utterly bewildered and with a despair
ing look at Bessie, who eat gazing at the
intruders with wide-open eyes and a funny
expression on her face, May placed her
hands over her ears.
After a hearty laugh at the consterna
N Jl â¢â stYoi# Mciit. .
tion their excitement had produced, May
exclaimed: "Now, girls, what were you
trying to tell us? Don't all speak at once,
please."
â¢â¢Well," answered Dotty Gardiner, a
cheery little body with bright golden
curls, "we are going on an exploring ex
pedition to the Haunted Castle and wish
you to go with us. Oh, dear, ibn't it a
warm day? But we have such a good'
lunch.' 1
With these words Miss Dotty dropped
into a chair and began to fan herself quite
furiously.
At the mention of "lunch," and a good
one at that, Bessie visibly awoke. She
shook herself, ran her fingers through
her hair and then emphatically declared:
"We shall go, sure."
"Too hot," May ventured, but her re
mark was met by so many cool assurances
that she anally gave in.
At last all was ready and they started
forth for a day of fun.
Up over green hills, down through shady
lanes, they took their way. Now crossing
and recrossing bright little wandering
streams, then pushing through fields of
waving corn, until they arrived at the
edge of the dark old forest.
Why! how they did shudder at the
sight of its shady depths 1 But they
bravely marched onward and in a short
time passed the last of the tall trees and
reached the sunshiny valley beyond.
At the further end of this valley arose a
high hill. When they bad climbed to the
top they ssTw before them the ruins of
what was once a magnificent structure,
but was now known as the Haunted
Cattle.

PREPARING FOR WINTER.
These squirrels have paused to consider
The fact that 't is late in the fall.
And time to lay nuts up for winter
If they would have any at all.
The red squirrel hoards like a miser;
But, alas, the improvident gray,
He's only a pauper of winter
Who scampers the summer away.
JUST LIKE OTHER CHILDREN.
Two little Gobolinks one day
Were sent to do the dishes;
Instead of which they ran away
And fished for shadow-fishes.
They fished and fished and fished and fished,
And but a leaf they caught-o;
And then they wished and wished and wished
They'd done the thing they ought to.
So by and by they homeward crept
With plumage drooping sadly;
And there they bowed their heads and wept
Because they felt so badly.

Sleep, baby, sleep.
How tender her love for each little one,
Sleep, sleep; sweetly sleep;
She softly called when the day was done,
"Sleep, sleep, sleep."

"You must be tired now, stop your play,
And come with me to dreamland away;

BABY'S FUNNY TRICK.
Oh, such a fat, roly-poly dumpling of a baby is the one about
whom I'm going to tell you to-day.
" Now mamma has the darling all undressed but his little shirtie
and his cunning socks," cried Polly to another wee girlie who had come
over to see the wonderful three-months-old baby brother.
" Hurry, mamma, pull off his little socks quick, and may be he'll
play with his tosies." So mamma quietly slipped off one tiny sock and
held it up. "My ! it doesn't look like a stocking at all," exclaimed
Polly's friend. "It's all bulgy out at the wrong places!" and, indeed,
it was a very odd-looking stocking after having held baby's pudgy leg
and foot all day. â¢
Baby stuck 1 his thumb in his rosy mouth, and watched the group
with a very merry twinkle in his eye, as much as to say, "Just wait!"
Then, quick as a flash, he planted the little bare foot right against
mamma's lips. Of course she covered it with kisses, and that was just
what the sly fellow intended she should do, for he then stuck it out at
Polly, who kissed it until her lips refused to smack any more, and then
at Mazy, who followed Polly's example; while baby chuckled with glee.
Mamma now uncovered the other foot, and the sly rogue insisted on
their going through the same performance over this set of pink toes,
Wasn't that fun ? and didn't that baby get hugged and squeezed for
being so cute? Why, mamma just had to drive the girlies away. She
said she was afraid they'd eat her baby right up. " Oh, Mazy," cried
Polly, " baby thought one precious foot might be jealous of the other!"
What funny little thought do you think baby had about it?

THE STAGE
The theatrical events of the week will be
the reopening of the Baldwin Theater for
the winter season and the departure of
the Frawley company after a long and
successful run at the Columbia. Most
managers of local stock companies, either
for reasons of prudence or economy, seem
to have a horror of novelties. The offer
*ngs they spread before us consist by
preference of operas we know by heart or
plays that have been tried on every other
important city of the Union, if indeed
tliey are not hoary-headed chestnuts worn
threadbare even here. Frawley has set
the example of letting San Francisco see
some brand new productions, and he can
not be too much commended for proving
that even from a box-office standpoint it is
not necessary to try new plays on Eastern
canines before offering them to the intelli
gent public of this City.
Oscar Hammerstein has written the
book and music of an opera called "Santa
Mhria." He has also staged and costumed
it, designed the scenery and produced it
at his own Olynipia. After such an exhi
bition of industry the New Yorfc critics
did not like to go away from the first per
formance and say unkind things about
"Santa Maria," so with one accord they
lauded the performers to the skies, and
said that Hammerstein's versatility was
something remarkable. "Versatility" wa3
considered a happy word, because it did
not commit the critics to any definite
opinion about the opera, and yet when
Hammerstein read it in the morning he
could not but leel flattered. Some of the
critics went so far as to say that they had
seen worse operas, but they also admitted
that they had been called upon to review
better works than "Santa Maria." How
ever, everything that Hammerstein
touches turns to gold, and it is said that
the new opera is drawing big houses at
tfee Olympia.
Baldwin Jheater.
To-morrow night the Baldwin Theater
will reopen for its winter season with
"The Prisoner of Zenda," a dramatization
of Anthony Hope's well-Known novel, in
which Daniel Frohman's Lyceum Com
pany met with great success in New York
last season.
The story is in a prologue and four acts,
the prologue being supposed to take place
in 1733, and the story proper in 1894. The
first act opens in a forest near Zenda, with
the English artist at work beneath the
trees. The coronation of the King's
double occurs in tne second act, and dur
ing the third act the bogus King meets
young Hentzau at the castle of Farlen
beim. The la.-t act passes in the dungeon
at Zenda, where Rassendyll rescues the
real King and returns him to the throne.
James Hackett plays the part of Rudolf
fiassendyll, the young Englishman who
impersonates the King of Rumania and
saves the throne, and Isabel Irving is the
Princess Flavia, who loves the impostor.
Besides these two the cast will include:
Maude Odell, Charles Walcot, Arthur El
liot, Howard Gould, Waiter S. Eale, Mar
vyn Dallas, R. J. Dustan and John Find
lay. The costumes, etc, will be those
which were used in the original New York
production.
Columbia Theater.
Palmer & Brady's "Trilby" company,
which has jut returned from a successful
tour in Australia, will open its return visit
to this City at the Columbia Theater to
monow evening.
The personnel of the company has
changed to some extent since "Trilby"
wa first heard at the Baldwin Theater,
but it is stated that the new people do
their Darts as well as their predecessors.
In order to make the production as per
fect as possible Brady has sent on Charles
Kent expressly for this presentation.
Kent has been playing Svengali in the
East with great success, and a good deal
of interest is centered in his appearance
here. Zou Zou is to be played by George
H. Trader. Miss Edith Crase still plays
Trilby, a part in which she won con
siderable praise from the Australian crit
ics. The company includes Jennie Reif
farth and W. E. Morrison.
After "Trilby" the new farce-comedy,
"Town Topic*," will come to the Colum
bia Theater. fc
At the Alcazar.
Monday evening will witness a revival
of Buckatone's funny farcical comedy,
"Married Life." The piece will be care
fully staged and the cast of the company
will be distributed as follows: Samuel
Coddle, Frank Do.->ne; Lionel Lynx, John
T. Sullivan; Frederick Younghusband, F.
B. Clayton; George Dismal, Carl Smith;
Henry Dove, J. B. Polk; Mrs. Samuel
Coddle, Mrs. F. M. Bates; Mrs. Lionel
Lynx, Amy Lee; Mrs. Frederick Young
husband, May Buckley; Mrs. George Dis
mal, Hattis Foley; and Mrs. Henry Dove,

Honor Bound," which will serve to intro
duce to the professional stage Miss Rosella
la Faille, a young lady well known on the
ama cur stage and in society circles.
Qrand Opera-Jlouse.
"The Big Bonanza," one of Augustin
Daly's plays, is to be produced at the
Grand to-morrow night. It is a satire on
stock gambling, and though it has not
been seen in this City for a number of
years the hits will no doubt be just as ap
propriate 8s they were in former days.
The story is of two brothers, one of
wbom becomes a student, and in his old
age is a poor professor, and tne other goes
into business and gets rich in "Wall street
and becomes a banker. The poor
brother scoffs at wealth and de
rides money-getters as men oi a
lower grade of mentality. The banker
brother, lo prove the falsity of this asser
tion, gives the pro.essor $30,000, declaring
that the student at the end of thirty days
will again be penniless. The action of the
play snows how tne professor is fleeced
right and left in Wall strebt, and, inci
dentally, is saved from ruin by Bob Rug
gles (Howard Kyle), a youne miner who
falls in love with Eugenia (Victory Bate
man), the banker's daughter, and wins
her by his manliness and devotion to her
uncle. L. R. Stockwell is the . student,

Alexander SaMni Will Probably
|JeVer fict Again.
News comes from Italy that Alexander
Salvini is stricken with tuberculosis at his
father's villa at Vaglioli, near Sienna, and
that in all probability he will never live to
appear before the footlights again.
For some time past the young tragedian
has been in failing health. Since his visit
to his father in Italy his agents have de
nied that his illness waa of a serious nature
and have constantly sent announcements
of his coming return to America for the
purpose of beginning his winter tour. Ac
cording to the Italian papers, however,
poor Salvini's theatrical career is ended.
Great sympathy is expressed lor the
illustrious tragedian, Tommaso Salvini,
who is tenderly watcninc over his son and
is doing all in his power to fi^lit off the
terrible disease that tins attacked him.
Speaking of the old man's care for Alex
ander, l'ltalia says: We hope with all
our Hearts, both for his sake and for the
sake of art, that the threatened mourning
In the house of Salvini may be averted.
Work and Degradation.
J. Cheever Goodwin, the author of the
book of "Lost, Strayed or Stolen," and
also the adapter of "Half a King," does
not like topical songs, without which no
comic opera nowadays appears to be com
plete. Francis Wilson, who has made a
very emphatic hit with his song, "If I
Were Realiy a King," in "Half a King"
at the Knickerbocker Theater, asked Man
ager Canby to request Mr. Goodwin to
send him several new verses to the song,
as his audiences were demanding encores
for every one of those he now has. Mr.
Canby received the new verses and en
closed with them was a bill reading:
: Francis Wilson, â¢
: To J. Cheever Goodwin, Dr. ;
: To two verses of topical song, and the

La Loie's patent.
According to the New York Sun, Loie
Fuller is on the warpath against Papinta,
Mrs. Hermann and others, who are said
to be borrowing her spectacular thunder.
Papinta, says the Sun, may not be so di
rect an offender as Mrs. Hermann, but
she's been at it longer, and it may be that
she will claim a counter right on Miss
Fuller. Papinta used a stageful of mir
rors in her dances, and has for several
years. Their arrangement was a device
of the late Count yon Prittwitz Palm, who
was also the inventor of the crystal maze.
The claim was made that the device was
patented, and as a result of an exhibition
of it to managers at Miner's People's Pa
pinta began to dance at Madison-square
in the then current Hoyt farce. Her dance
at that time was an ordinary serpentine
reflected in mirrors, but at the Olyrnpia
last winter she adopied the method of
lighting from t>elow and above, using the
mirrors as well, and being reflected as a
gorgeous sian'inl.
Zueo, at Kosier & Bial's, danced in
much the same manner, though her mir
rors seemed to be in separate sections. At
the Standard^ Loie Fuller also used mir
rors, and she had one big frame of plain
glass. It may be that the patent on the
mirror device is m-rely for a certain
arrangement, and that the other dancers
get around this by arranginz them in
another way, but wherein Miss Fuller's
exclusive rights come in is not clear.
Mrs. Hermann claims that in her dances
she follows plates from Rider Hageard's
"She," etchings of East India virgins wor
ship ng at Delhi and pictures of Peru's
sun-dancers. She claims, and correctly,
that the trick of lighting the dancer from
below was done before Miss Fuller's use
of it. She admits that "Miss Fuller's ap
pearance in her novelty skirt-dancing,
with its accompanying adjuncts of calcium
lights in colors and minor effects, first
suggested to her the idea of using similar
dances."
Dramatic Brevities.
Nat C. Goodwin will play at the Baldwin dur

Kathryn Kldder has completed a comedy
which she calls "Loves at War."

Life of JM\jers
Continuing my biography of L. E. Myers,
the champion runner of ten years ago, I
now reach that period which marks an
era in his life. Last week we saw nirn de
feat W. G. George, the champion distance
runner of Eugland, in the half-mile run,
the first of the series of three races.
The second race was a mile and was
held on the old polo grounds in New York
City, November 11, 1882. Let it be re
membered that the three weeks in No
vember in the East is the loveliest season
n the year for active outdoor sports. It
seldom rains, is generally sunshiny, and
always clear and crisp. Omitting the sun
shine, such was the weather in which
George and Myers ran the mile.
A.B usual Myers dropped behind his an
tagonist's shoulder, remaining there until
the last furlong was reached. Then it was
seen that however great Myers was at the
half mile he could not stay with George
for a mile. As an official timekeeper, I
was stationed with another to catch the
time for eleven-twelfths of a mile; this I
did, the latter passing ten yards ahead of
Myers.
Having caught the time, I did not stop
to compare notas with my constituent, but,
gripping my timepiece in my hand, rushed
down the homestretch a little in the rear
of George and about on a level with Myers,
and this I saw: George finished in
4:21 2-5; Myers came to a full stop ten
yards from the tape, a spectator getting in
his path, then, recovering himself,
walked over the line in order
to make a record. When George finished
Myers was eighteen yards behind. As the
former's time was 4:21 2-5 one has only to
calculate to see that the American would
have finished in 4:25 had be been allowed
to fin.sh â at least that was the opinion
which we, that is, a number of ti:e offi
cials, arrived at in discussing the matter
at the time.
However, his time was actually 4:273-5.
Thus was the American record beaten by
both Englishman and American, being
held by Myers in 4:29}^. In reflecting on
these limes remember that Myers had run
100 yards in 10 seconds. No living man
has ever made such a showing.
The three-quarter mile race, which was
to have completed the series, was forfeited
by Myers on account of illness, but his
over-enthusiastic friends patched up a
race for the distance named, to be held on
Thanksgiving day. They must have left
the elements out of their calculations, for
it turned bitterly cold and began to snow.
There were a few additional races, and
as 1 was the winner of the walk I speak
from experience when I say that after I
had finished it took me halt an hour to
get the numbness out of my feet. Such
was the day when this sreat race took
place. The temperature was 15 degrees,
and there was an icy wind blowing, al
though the sun was shining brightly.
In this race Myers clung closer to George
than in former races, even forcing the
pace at times. Up to fifty yards from the

tape the race was undecided; Myers was
then expected to go past him on the
finish, but his wonderful speed was oom
p lied to succumb before the stamina of
the Englishman, and George crawled
ahead amid a perfect whirlwind of ap
plause.
The time of the winner was 3:10)4, and
although Myers was only five yards in the
rear when the leader broke the tape he
slowed up and finished in 3:13. These
times remained the best on record in
America and the best by an American
until within a few years.
Two weeks after "this race Myers beat
another record, and I only mention it to
demonstrate the wonderful ability of the
man as an all-round runner. In a sixty
yard run he started in a race oh a sawdust
path, more or less soft, thougn it
may have been as hard as a roller
could make it. which is not say
ing much. Under such adverse cir
cumstances, with very little training if
any, for the cinder paths were all buried
in snow, he ran the sixty yards in 6 2-5
seconds. Ask any friend posted in ath
letics what he thinks of such a per
formance from a man who nad run a three
quarters of a mile in the snow in 3:13 but
a fortnight before.
The year 1883 was what might be called
an "off year" with the subject of our
sketch â that is, he did not do anything
particularly great. In 1884 Myers once
more went to England. On June 5 he
made his first public appearance In Eng
land for that trip and won the qnarter
mile with absurd ease in 49 3-5 seconds.
The next day Myers distinguished himselt
in the half-mile, for which he was prob
ably reserving himself the day before. In
this he really let himself out, but having
no on* to push him won by over thirty
yards. At any rate the time was 1:65 2-5,
the best amateur record in the world.

The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperatur* for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and bundredths.
during the past twelve hours. isobars, or solid
lines, connect potn s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. . 1 he
word "hleh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather; "low"
refers : to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain i.
"Lows" us. ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the Interior
and low along tbe coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coa>-t. rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "hiÂ«h" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter.- The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

< Vv OOLâ The cucu.ar â  f Jacob Woilner says: "Ii
gives me p. ensure to be able | to report thnt we had
a very lively market the last week. Over 1.000,
--000 lbs of Wool has been sold and four scouring
mills are running and some lo:s of Wool â¢ were
bought for as tern Btilpmenw Prices ar-? not very
high Â»s yet, but they; are better than anticipated.
Ibe reason,' lor tots cban.e Is the feeling in he
East . hat the election uf^icKinley is an assured
fact. The sales of Una week comprise all kinds of
Wool f rev from -seeds . and burs. 1 here is still no
demand <or uefective vVools. The London sales
now in progress are reported â  steady, with a silgtit
decline from the last series in July, but still the
relative values. in this country, are lower than In
tbe European market, a. id If our market iocs not
go much nlgner we will have a chance to snip a
good (1 al of Wool so as to relieve: the large stock
' ti.a; has been carried over f 10m las: year an 1 also
this year's clip, which baa accumulated in the last
six months, as manufacturers have used very lit-'
tie. The outlook is ihiÂ«t we will have a steady
market, but the price may not improve materially.'
Kail Woois are coming in slowly and it seems that
most of the growers want to hold-their Wools until
otter the election. *In my. opinion Wood will not
go any higher, as there is too large a stock in the
Kastern market, iron) whence comes th? report of
large sales 10 speculators, j with prices the same.
With all tbe influx of gold, from 1 umpe it seems
thai the money market s not Improved materially
and bankers are not anxious to let money 10 even
on approv. d papers or to advance nionev to specu
lators jon the } raw . material. \ Our ' market : doses

COMMERCIAL MEN
FOR McKINLEY
Five for the Friend of
Protection to One
for Bryan.
Analysis of a 'Poll Which Has
Recently Been Made Through
the Mail.
TRAVELEKS GIVE SEASONS.
Outspoken and Convincing Are the
Men Who Daily Come Into
Contact With Trade.
For McKlnley I**
For Bryan â¢ 26
The above figures give the Presidential 1
preferences of 170 commercial travelers ,
who have written to The Call, answering j
a circular letter of inquiry which was sent \
cut to the craft generally. The signifi- j
cance of this showing can hardly be mis- j
understood. The proportion of com- j
meroial travelers who see that prosperity I
can only come to the country through the ;
election of William McKinley is over
6 to 1 compared to the number who say
that they will vote for William J. Bryan.
There is no other class of citizens enjoy
ing equal opportunities to come into con
tact with all sorts and conditions of busi
ness men and to learn the drift and trend
of enlightened public opinion. There is !
no other class of citizens able to meet the j
general public under as many varying j
conditions. Selected by reason of adroit- j
ness, intelligence, skill and address and j
with senses kept constantly on the alert,
their perceptions are keen and ail shades
of opinions are elicited by and weighed by j
them.
The men with whom they deal in a
business way are the most sensitive of all
classes to current indications of trade and
most concerned in making a correct and
unbiased diagnosis of the same. Collec- j
tively they are acquainted with the views
of every locality. Tbe commercial travel- 1
ers hear and consider all ti at tbey have to
Bay. The commercial traveler, moving j
about in cars, on boats, in stages and in
all sorts of out-of-the-way places and in |
all centers where population congregates, !
talks with the customers of these mer- j
chants, with wage-earners, with capital- |
ists, with everybody. From these facts it i
appears clearly that tbe result of the can- I
vass concerning tbe Presidential prefer
ences of the commercial travelers is more
significant than any that has preceded it. j
It is not only an expression of individual
opinion â it is the consensus of many
opinions.
Some travelers have caused to accom
pany their answers a stipulation tbat their
ieasons sbali not be published. Ohers ob- :
ject to the use of their names but they are
comparatively few. Here are some
sample utterances by thoee who have an
nounced that they are for McKinley:
J. H. Commetâ Protection is tbe watch
word. The "nigger in the fence" is free
silver.
H. E. Heacoceâ Am for McKinley, pro
tection and free coinage by international
agreement. Was born and raised in Stark
County, Ohio, and have known of Major
McKinley and his family ever since I can
remember. lam familiar with his puolic
career, both local and National, and con
sider him well qualified for the Presi
dency.
J. S. Waldeckâ l favor the election of
McKinley for President and don't you for
get it.
Ben Levyâ With all respect for Bryan,
McKinley forever.
Max Sommer â In protect ion lies pros
perity. In my judgment good times will
oome with the starting up ol our mills
and factories.
Eugene L. Kohlbergâ Although a Demo
crat 1 favor Major McKinley. 1 have
just returned from Washi ngton, Idaho
and Montana. All merchants whom I in
terviewed favor the gold standard and
honest money.
Julius Siegel â I am satisfied that nearly
â¢11 the Pacific Coast commercial travelers
are working hard for McKinley and pro
tection.
Charles J. Kingâ lf McKinley is elected
I feel Bare that it will be the beginning of
an era of unprecedented prosperity for our
country.
Reed Jones â Oregon is sure to go for
McKinley. Changes here are wonderful
In tbe past few weeks, and all are for Mc-
Kinley.
M. H. Barryâ The election of McKinley
is so certain that any remark would be
superfluous.
Nat J. Tobiasâ l will rote for McKinley
for the reason that no one has tola me
why free silver is good, and I favor sound
money.
Jerome B. Youngâ l favor the election
of McKinley simply because I am an
American citizen and believe that we
should have protection and tbat foreign
immigration should be restricted as well.
George R. Savasreâ My motto is to vote
for the man who will do the most good,
and I think that McKinley is the man.
H. G. Weisbrodâ My experience as a
traveling man is that the sentiment of the
merchants I nave called on in the past
two weeks, regardless of party politics, is
tbat what tbe country needs is a restora
tion of confidence, and the best and
quickest way to restore the same is to elect
a Republican.
H. H. Yarrington â I favor tha election
of McKinley first, last and all the time,
like all traveling salesmen.
R. H. Davis â Inclosed please find the
names of seven commercial travelers, and
each one is for McKinley, protection,
sound money and a chance to earn it.
Ed Goldsmith â I favor tbe election of
William McKinley, and God help us if he
ain't elected.
T. E. McShaneâ l believe, with McKin
ley, that open mills, not open mints, are
the present need of the country.
Robert H. Nauntonâ l think McKinley
is the only man that can save the country
at present.
Â£. J. Bachelderâ l have just come
through Oregon. McKinley will get the
four votes of Oregon.
C. B. Tomsonâ l favor the election of
McKinley, and I don't care who knows it.
A. D. Simpsonâ l favor the election of
McKinley and protection to our industries,
bo that labor will be given employment.
Alfred B. Brunnerâ l favor McKinley,
tbe only medium of prosperity.
A. H. Wilsonâ lf McKinley is elected it

faimon F. Juda â McKiniey and protec
tion mean prosperity for all.
E. 0. Regensburger â Protection should
be the main issue of the day. We should
keep as much money as we possibly can
at home, instead of sending such enor
mous sums to foreign countries.
S. K. Thorntonâ l have recently visited
the most populous portion of the State
north of San Francisco, and state, as my
best judgment, that California will give
McKinley a handsome majority.
H. S. Rosenthal â While favoring silver
under an international agreement the
question of protection appears to me to be
the paramount issue.
Reuben Cohenâ l favor the election of
McKinley for the benefit of everybody;
bound to have better times.
Charles S. Jacobs â Tho good of the coun
try and its future prosperity depend
largely upon McKinley's election.
B. F. Noyes â The success of McKinley
means a return of the good, old prosper
ous times in all lines. We hope to em
ploy at least 100 more hands next season.
Daniel Bruton â I have voted the Demo
cratic ticket for thirty years, but cannot
swallow Bryan, Altgeld or their principles.
C. C. McCray â Protection means more
to all American citizens than the so-called
silver policy, which will debase our cur
rency. McKinley will be elected because
the people are disgusted with Democratic
promises.
C. B. La Shellsâ l am in favor of Mc-
Kinley, protection, sound money and the
Nation's honor.
B. C. Samuelâ l favor McKinley. I
have been a Democrat all my life, and will
vote the Republican ticket this election for
the first time.
W. J. Tilley â I consider protection to
home industry the most important ques
tion before the people to-day.
Julius Bambergerâ l favor the election
of McKinley. In my opinion, Bryan rep
resents ail that is vicious and against the
best interests of the whole country.
Charles Rummelsburg â I am subject to
wages, and am under the belief that the
election of Bryan would prove disastrous
to the wage-earners. I favor McKinley.
J. H. Davis â I favor the election of Mc-
Kinley. I believe it is for the beet interest
of my country-
Simon Caro â Protection is what we want
for all onr people, whether for tbe poorest
or the richest. McKinley is solid on that
point.
Tnomas H. Nichols â I find in my trav
els ti. rough the State that McKinley is
gaining every day, and will carry Califor
nia by 12,000.
W. E. Cumbackâ l favor the election of
McKinley because of my conviction that
he will promote a policy of vital interest
at this time â sound money and protection.
Edward A. Kaher â My choice for Presi
dent is McKinley, God bless him. Elect
him and we will have better times.
There am letters arriving by every mail
from commercial travelers. Many only
tiay, "I favor the election of William Mc-
Kinley for President." Among this num
ber are the following well-known men:

give their reasons. Below are a few

Bryan for President. He's all right.

WHERE IS WERNER?
He Left San Jose to Come to San Fran
cisco and Has Since Been
Mlg.ln,.
Joseph Werner, who has been living in
San Jose lour or five years, came to this
City last Tuesday with the intention of
entering the German Hospital as a pa
tient, he having been ill some time.
He had with him some money and was
very well dressed. Since he lelt San Jose
nothing has been heard from him. Yes
terday his friends came to the City from
San Jose to look for him. All the hospi
tals were visited, but no knowledge of him
was gained. He has not been in the hos
pitals. His friends, much surprised and
distressed, are looking for him without
any clew.
Werner is aged 44. He is about 5 feet
and 4 inches and of medium build. His
face is very white from sickness. His
bair is very dark, almost black, and his
mustache is brown. His eyes an- daik
brown. He wore a dark suit when he left
San Jos<> ana also a black slouch bat. He
speaka English with a strong German ac
cent. Attorney S. F. Leib of San Jose
and J. W. Taylor, 675 Mission street, are
searching for Werner and fear that he has
met with foul play.
Wanted for Perjury.
Louise Debernardi, 14 years of age, swore to
a complaint in Judge Campbell's court yester
day, charging Mrs. Emalle Uhlmann with per
jury. Louise was arrested about a week ago
on the charge of cruelty to animals prefem d
by Mrs. Uhlmann, who has a ranch on the Â£an
Bruno road. The charge was dismissed by
Judge Campbell on Thursday, hence the war
rant for perjury.

FAVORABLE PAROLE REPORTS.
Ex-Director J. H. Neff Presented With
a Beautuul Silver Set by His
Colleagues.
A meeting of the prison directors was
held yesterday, a week in advance of the
regular date. This was in order tbat the
board and officers might properly present
their respects to J. H. Neff, the recently
retired prison director. Directors Wil
kins, Hayes, Devlin and President Fiiz
gerald were present and hastened through
with the routine business.
L. Wadhaui, the expert accountant, pre
sented a report that he had examined
the books of the board and prison officials,
and that all moneys, accounts, etc., were
correct as presented by Clerk Ellis. The
total cash on Land is $597647; cash belong
ing to prisoners, $3325 69. The several
funds on October 1 were as follows: Gen
eral appropriation, $116,047 22; State
prison fund, $180 90; jute revolving fund,
$88,527 38; cash in bank, $5876 07; cash in
vault, $100 40. Total, $210,731 97.
Reports from twelve parole convicts in
various parts of the State were read and
led the directors to believe that the system
is working to good ends. Tue twelve men
have saved over and aboye expenses some
thing like $500. Nearly all who have been
released on parole seem to be trying to
lead better lives.
George Gruel, a rancher sentenced to
five years' imprisonment for stealing a
horse and buggy from a stable at Holiister,
as&ed to be released on parole. His
friends stated that the larceny was the
oucgrowth of a drunken spree and not
from any criminal intent, as he had plenty
of money at the time. Gruel has only
served one year.
John Henley, who has been in the prison
over twenty years, asked to be released on
parole. The old man was convicted of
murder for having killed a man named
Braumstetter in Humboldt County. The
trouble was over a game of cards. "Henley
once before endeavored to secure executiv
clemency, but failed for some reason.
Henley is now 62 years of age.
The board decided to recommend the
Governor to commute Henley's sentence
to thirty-three and a third years. With
the credits the. old man has earned by
good behavior he will be released in a
month if the Governor accedes to the rec
ommendation. The old man received the
news with unmoved lace and said that he
iiad been disappointed so olten that there
was no use to shout until ne was out and
free again.
ThÂ«) board aluo decided to recommend
tbat Governor Budd pardon David Johns,
who was sentenced to five years for grand
larceny. The prisoner's youth and the
wishes of prominent citizens oi San Fran
cisco induced this recommendation.
Robert Bennett, seconded by his friends
in this City, made a great effort to secure
a parole. He was sentenced to a long
term of imprisonment for having com
mitted a felonious assault upon a woman
on Polk street. He denied that he was
guilty of the crime, and claimed that on
the occasion he was very drunk.
All of t c parole cases not heard or
decided yesterday will be considered to
day.
The directors granted Warden Hale two
weeks' leave of absence, as that official has
not been in good health of late.
Several weeks aÂ«o Ye Git Tong severely
slabbed Gee GoÂ»n in the dining-room, the
trouble growing out of a long standing
feud between the two. A short time ago
Goon stabbed Tone. The board decided
to take away all the credits due to Tong
and send Goon back to the Folsom prison
so as to have them separated.
Warden Hale said that in the commit
ment of Dick Williams Uniied States
Judge Morrow had erased the words
"hard labor." He did not know how to
interpret this order, as the Warden has to
follow the State law.
'i he board believed that Judge Morrow
simply meant that "Thrifty Dick" should
not be put at cxc ssively hard labor.
President Fitzgerald did not believe
that it was necessary to send Williams
out to work on the road with the road
gang, as he might spoil the other convicts,
nor is it necessary that the prisoner
sbonld be kept in idleness.
Governor Budd was expected at the
meeting, but he did not arrive in time to
attend the afternoon meeting.
J. H. NEFF FETED.
The Ex-Prison Director Receives a
' Beautiful Silver Water
Set.
A short time ago J. H. Neff resigned as
one of the Board of State Prison Directors
and his place was filled by the appoint
ment of R. T. Devlin, who had previously
served in the same capacity. Mr. Neff's
colleagues desired to present him with
some token of respect and after communi
cating their wishes to Warden Hale left
the entire matter in his hands. Tee lat
ter did justice to the responsibility re
posed in him.
Last evening there was a pleasant gath
ering in the Director's house at San Quen
tin. Shortly after the board adjourned
in the afternoon Governor Budd and Mr.
Neff arrived from San Francisco. As
their carriage appeared aronnd the hill
the San Quentin brass band struck up
"Hail to the Chief," which was well ren
dered by the boys in stripes.
Several other pieces were played. After
the guests had rested they repaired to the
house mentioned and sat down to a sump
tuous feast. Those present were: Gov
ernor Budd, J. H. Neff, Warden Charts
Aull of Folsom, L. Wadham, Captain W.
G. Leale, Captain John Leale, Frank Lin
coln, R. Fleicher Tilton, R. M. Fitzgerald,
R. T. Devlin, Daniel E. Hayes, J. H. Wil
kins, Warden W. E Hale and J. V. Ellis.
President Fitzgerald presided, and in a
well-turned speech presented Mr. Neff
with a beautiful soild silver set, consisting
of a pitcher, goblet and salver. On the
pitcher was inscribed the following:
Presented to Hon. J. H. Neff, ex-prison di
rector, by his colleagues on the present board
of State prison directors, E.igar J. de Pne,
Daniel Â£. Hayes, R. M. Fhzgerald, J. H. Wilk
ins, Robert T.Devlin, J. V. Ellis, secretary;
W. E. Hale, warden.
San Quentin, Oct. 3, 1896.
It was a late hour before the guests and
their friends retired. During the evening,
which was passed with music, songs,
speeches and recitations, the following
toasts were proposed and responded to:
"To our honored guest, J. H. Neff." by R. T.
Dev'in; "His Excellency, Governor Budd,"
R. M. Fitzgerald; 'The Funny Side of Life."
Frank Lincoln; "The Btate Prison Directors
and Their Duties," J. H. Neff; "Our Absent
Friends, the Ladies," Warden Hale; "Prison
Offloads." Captain Aull; "Where Are We At?"

FEUDNER WINS
THE DIAMOND.
The Fay Medal Goes Once
More to the Former
Holder.
Second Day's Shoot of the Cali
fornia Sportsmen's Asso
ciation.
SOME GOOD SCORES MADE.
Many C'ean Scores Made â Ties
Carried Through Various
Events.
The second day's shooting of the Cali
fornia Sportsmen's Association was held
at San Bruno yesterday, where some ex
cellent woik was done.
The first entry was with six birds, with
an entrance fee of $5. In this match
Prince Poniatowski took a hand, and ac
quitted himself with honors, tying the
crack marksman Feudner on the last bird.
In consequence of the evenness of the
game it was decided to throw the contest
into tho second entry.
In tuis Robinson's gnn went back on
him in some manner and he withdrew, as
did the Prince, leaving a tie between Fan
nine, Hait;ht and Feudner, each of whom
took down twelve birds.
They divided the entrance, and pro
ceeded on the third entry of a similar
number of birds. In this contest Prince
Poniatowski was more fortunate, as he
tied the crack State sportsman Feudner,
each taKing down eleven birds, and leav
ing Slade, Robinson, Fanning and Webb
with ten each. Haight and Fox withdrew
at the seventh and eighth round respec
tively.
Poniatowski and Feudner divided the
entrance, as the Prince had to return to
the City on the 12 o'clock train.
The great event of the afternoon was
the shoot for the Fay diamond medal.
Robinson withdrew early in the event
leaving Siadp, Feurtner, Webb, Fox'
Haight and Grubb to shoot it oui. After
a most protracted contest, ail withdrew
leaving Fox and Feudner in the field, and
as each man succeeded in tumbling all
Its birds, it looked as if it wouid have to
be a draw.
Five more birds were trapped and the
two marksmen started in turain, but Fax
missed his first bird and Feudner rolled
over his five, and was thus declared the
winner of the medal and the sum ot $47,
oesides being credited on the secretary's
books with a free tntry for next year's
contest.
The medal had been won one year ago
by its present holder, a circumstance
which has not before occurred in the his
tory of the club.
The following are the scores:
First entryâ Robinson 6, Fanning 6, Haight
6, Prince Poniatowskl 6, Slade 6, Feudner 6,
Eckers.
Second entryâ Robinson withdrawn, Fan
ning 12, Haight 12, Webb withdrawn, Prince
Pouiatowski no score, Slade withdrawn, Feud
ner 12.
Third entryâ Slade 10, Robinson 10, Fan
ning 10, Feudner 11, Wtbb 10, Poniatowski
11, Half ht withdrawn. Fox withdrawn.
