VICTORIA, B. C, May 26.â The gayety
and .jubilee with which loyal Victorians
were to have celebrated the anniversary
of their Queens birth to-day were turned
to sadness and mourning by an appalling
acccident, in which scores of lives went
ou.t.
As the thousands of revelers were trav
eling for Macaulay Point shortly after
1 o'clock to witness the sham tight and
naval review near the Esquimalt station,
the bridge over Point Ellice Bay gave way,
precipitating into the waters 100 feet be
neath a heavily loaded electric car and
several private vehicles.
Down upon this struggling human mass
came the giant timbers of the bridge,
crushing out dozens of lives. A strong
tide swept out to sea the bodies of many
who escaped death in the awful plunee,
and of the 200 persons who were hurled
into the water scarcely half survive.
The list of dead numbers upward of
eighty, and the bodies of sixty-two un
fortunates have been recovered. Many of
those borne away by the tide will never
be found, and the actual loss of life will
probably never be known.

The sham-fight and naval review were
to take place at Macaulay Poitit, near
Esquimalt, this afternoon, and crowds
were making their way there by every
route. All the tramcars were packed with
visitors. At 1:30 o'clock a large and
heavily laden car left Government street,
having upward of 10C people on board.
When the middle span of the traffic
bridge, about 150 feet in length, was
reached it collapsed, throwing the car and
a number of carriages and foot-passengers
into the water, 100 feet beneath.
The car was completely submerged, and

all the passengers save a few who were on
the platform and roof were drowned. A
number were killed by falling timbers and
a few escaped by clinging to the floating
ruins of the bridge. The car was buried
under twenty-five feet of water, and doz
ens of men, women and children were
pinned under the wreckage, unable to
strive for life.
On the surface of Victoria Arm, strug
gling people fought to gain the shore.
Strong men and frail women battled for
their lives. Husbands emerged from the
wreckage, only to find that their wives
had gone down to death. Children were
carried down by those who were stronger,
and father? also had struggled from be
neath the timbers and debris of bridge
and car and carriages returned to their
doom in vain endeavor to rescue their
babes. The waters of the Arm for yards
around were dyed red with blood, and
floating out to sea went corpse after corpse,
borne on by the tide.
The shrieks of men, the screams of
women and children filled the air and
nerved the crowds of rescuers on to feats
that endangered life and limb.
The number of carriages lost and the
foot-passengers carried down in the wreck
cannot oe learned. It is claimed by many
that fully 200 persons went down with the
span and that more than half of them
perished. The accident occurred so
quickly that nobody has a very clear
recollection of what transpired. Â»
The work of rescue was inaugurated
with all possible haste and over tliirty
bodies were recovered by 4 o'clock. They
were carried to Captain Grant's garden
lawn, where they were cared for by willing
bands. In several cases persons seem
ingly dead were resuscitated, and the wail
ings of relatives gave way to tears of joy
and words of thanksgiving.
Owing to the fact that nearly every kind
of craft in the harbor was engaged for the
"THE CZAR IS CROWNED! "-THE IMPERIAL PROCESSION AFTER THE CEREMONY.
ThÂ« accompanying sketch was drawn by a "Call " artist from an engraving published In the London Graphic of June 9, 1883, and represents Alexander IU, father of the pres
ent Czar, passing from the Cathedral of the Assumption to the Cathedral of the Archangel Michael after the coronation ceremony. The event took place on thÂ» 27th of May, 1883,
and the ceremony performed yesterday, when Nicholas II was crowned monarch of all the Russias, was Identical In every respect with that which took place thirteen years ago. In

day, boats were hard to procure, and the
work of rescue was somewhat slow.
Steam and naphtha launches were hurried
to the scene, and in this particular the
boats of tbe various warships were the
most active. Scores of people who were
floundering in the water or clinging to
the debris were picked up and taken to
places of safety, but many sank before the
eyes of the rescuers ere they could be
reached.
Thousands of sorrowing friends and
relatives crowded abound the approaches
to the bridge, eagerly scanning each body
as it was brought to land. Mothers,
crazed by the loss of husbands or children,
attempted to jump into the Arra in their
eagerness to rescue their loved ones. As
body after body was brought to the shore
crowds rushed forward to search each
mangled face, yet dreading the possibility
that it might be that of some one whom
they hoped had escaped from the death
trap. '
Up to 10:30 o'clock siity-two bodies had
been taken from the bay. Twenty persons
known to have been on the bridge at the
time of the accident are missing and it is
supposed that they have perished. The
car register shows ninety fares and it is
probable that over 125 people were on
board.
The rescue of some of the victims was,
under the circumstances, almost miracu
lous. Among those saved were Mr. and

down he jumped and dived. Coming up
and catching a bridge timber be saw a
lady rise near him and seized her. She
was a Victoria woman who bad accom
panied himself and wife. Then he saw
his wife's cloak appear upon the water.
He called to a man to save her, and not in
vain, for the man swam to Mrs. Foster's
rescue and bore her to the land.
Superintendent J. Wilson of the Cana
dian Pacific Railroad Telegraphs was driv
ing a carriage containing his wife and five
children directly behind the ill-fated car.
His vehicle was swept down and in a mo
ment the entire family were struggling in
the water. With rare presence of mind
Mr. Wilson succeeded in saving his wife
and four of the children. The fifth child,
a little boy, was wedged beneath some
wreckage and drowned.
Since early morning Victoria had been
filled with visitors and pleasure-seekers
hailing from nearly every section of the
Pacific Nortbwest and the list of dead in
cludes many from outside British Colum
bia points and the States of Washington !
and Oregon.
From every part of the Northwest tele- j
grams inquiring as to the safety* of friends j
and relatives came pouring into Victoria '
from anxious ones at home. Those of the '
visitors who were fortunate enough to es- j
cape death with disaster were correspond
ingly busy sending out cheering words of
their safety and welfare.
The Point Ellice bridge was built about
ten years ago by the Ranfran Bridge Com
pany. It was partially of iron, with hol
low piers, tilled with concrete, and had a
plank flooring. It is said that two years j
I ago the bridge was condemned by officials.
I Four years ago, on the occasion of a for
mer Queen's birthday celebration, a street
car filled with people in passing over it
partially broke through, but there was no
serious injury or fatality.
It was about 300 feet long and ran across '
Victoria Arm, a continuation of Victoria
harbor, the Arm extending ud some six
miles. The bridge site is on the road to
Esquimalt and is within the city limits.
The bridge is said to have cost about
$11,000.
The disaster cast a pall of gloom over
the city, ana all sports, including the
sham battle, were at once cancelled.

John A. Van Bokkelen, one of the victims
in the terrible accident at Victoria this
afternoon, was one of the wealthiest and
most popular yonng men in this city.

well off and prominent, being the eldest
son of Dr. McCurdy, the first practicing
physician in thin section.

MOSCOW, Russia, May 26.â The great
event, for which untold preparations had
been made, is over. The supreme func
tion was accomplished without a hitch.
The weather was perfect, and everything
led the people to look forward with hope
to the reign of N^cuolas 11, the ruler of
millions.
The proclamation issued to-day by the
Czar on the occasion of his coronation
prescribes various remissions, of which
the following are the principal:
All arrears of taxes in European Russia
and Poland are remitted, and the land
tax is reduced by half for ten years.
The sentences of exiles iv Siberia are
materially reduced, political offenders re
ceiving further remissions, with the res
toration of their civil rights in certain
cases. The ex-Ministers of the Interior
and Justice are empowered to submit to
the Czar deserving cases of those pun
ished after a regular trial. Those persons
who shared in the Folish rebellion who
are not guilty of murder, cruelty, arson or
robbery are exempted from the police
supervision decreed in 1883, and ara
granted full freedom of residence if they
return to their own country and take the
oath of alJegiance.
To-day was the chief day of all those
given up to the coronation ceremonies. The
weather was fine and the sky cloudless.
The Kremlin, which was the center of at*
traction, was early surrounded by ..waiting,
crowds, who had no possible chance of
gettiug inside, but were satisfied to see
what they could outside tbe walls. Troops
headed by bands of music beean moving
at 4 o'clock in the morning, marching to
the Kremlin. At 7 o'clock a iialvo of
twenty-one guns was firea and 7:30 the
bells of the cathedral began to peal.
Assembled in the halls of the Kremlin
Palace were all of the personages forming
the Czar's cortege, the ladies of the court,
noted dignitaries, officers in uniform, etc.
All of the accesses to tie palace and the
cathedral, as well as the route of the im
perial cortege, were guarded by double
lines of troops, and round and within the
courts of the palace were squadrons of
cavalry. Crowds thronged the streets at
an early hour, and those who were fortu
nate enotigh to possess cards of admission
to the small Cathedral of the Assumption,
where the coronation ceremonies were
solemnized, were early at the Kremlin,
seeking their places,
A definite place had been allotted to
each, as the space within the cathedral is
exceedingly small, and no one outside of
members of the imperial family, the for
eign sovereiens, princes or their repre
sentatives, the diplomatic corps and a
favored few were able to enter the sacred
precincts. A mass of people filled the
great Red square. No one was allowed
within tbe Kremlin walls without a ticket
until the ceremony began, as even here
thousands had to be accommodated who
could not hope to see the coronation act
itself, but only the accompanying cere
monies which took place without the
cathedral.
The famous red staircase leading up by
the side wall of the Granovitava Palace
into the Kremlin Palace, down which the
royal party came, was covered with crim
son cloth. Tbe Cathedrals of the Assump
tion, tbe Annunciation and the Arch
angel were connected by means of a wide
wooden path carpeted with crimson cloth,
stretching from tbe red staircase and
branching off to the doors of the cathe
drals and to the entrances of the large
square of the Kremlin, through which
their Majesties would pass on making the
circuit of the cathedrals and the Ivan
Tower, after being crowned, in order to
sliow themselves to the populace. Within
the inclosure formed by the pathways
were deputations from various regiments
and civil deputies from the provinces.
Just before it was time for the Czar to
appear at the top of the Red Square the
broad spaces of the Kremlin were densely
packed with perhaps 100,000 people, press
ing closely up to the very fence of the
inner square between the cathedrals.
At a little before 8 o'clock the special
correspondents were allowed to view the
interior of the cathedral, as only a few of
the representative correspondents could
be accommodated at the ceremony itselt.
The cathedral, with its white sandstone
exterior, surmounted by its five golden
domes, presented a most brilliant appear
ance within.
The available room within the cathedral
is about eighty feet square, and this is
broken by enormous circular pillars and
some monuments distributed throughout
the church. The Ikonstas, which, like a
screen, divides the chancel from the
nave, is covered with repousse worK of
beaten gold and hung with ecclesiastical
paintings, some of which are very ancient,
and more than one has miraculous powers
ascribed to it. Plates of gold cover the
walls, and there is scarcely any space that
is not coated with precious metals or
stones. In one shrine covered with gold,
silver and precious stones is an image of
the Virgin of enormous value, under which
lie the bones and ashes of the venerated
saints.
Between the four pillars in the center ol2
the church on a dais covered with red vel
vet, bordered with heavy gold trimmings,
embroidered at the Corners with eagles,
were two thrones facing the Ikonstas.
Upon this dais, which was six feet high
and approached by twelve steps, was a
landing midway and small platforms for
the groups of ladies of the court, masters
of ceremonies, etc Over the thrones was
a magnificent square baldachin of purple
velvet lined with ermine hanging from
the roof between the two pillars furthest
from Ikonstas. In the center, surmount
ing the baldachin, was an immense gilded
"crown.
At 8:15 numerous ladies and gentlemen
of the court, in brilliant dresses and uni
forms, entered and took their places, and
at 8:30 the great bell in tbe Ivan tower be
gan to peal, giving the signal to all other
bells, which took up the peal and re
sounded throughout the city. A large
number of bishops and priests in mag
nificent robes were in attendance. As the
bell of Ivan Vleki tolled out the half hour,
the male choir, which in Greek churches
is always concealed, began to intone the
Te Deum.
Their beautiful voices swelled to the
tones of the grand and solemn anthem
and seemed a fitting reparation to the
ceremony about to begin. At a quarter to
9 the diplomatic body and special envoys,
headed by the Count de Montebello, the
French Embassador, who in the inability
of the Turkish Embassador to be present
in a Greek church was the dean of the
diplomatic corps, slowly filed into the
sacred building. The choir continued
singing and at 9 o'clock the sound of
cheers and roars from the waiting throngs
outside announced the fact that the royal
party was approaching.
Shout after shout rose upon the air,
drums sounded, bells pealed and the
bands grouped in the creat square played
tbe national anthem.
At these sounds the Metropolitans of
Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kieff and sev
eral of the higher clergy proceeded to the
southern entrance of the cathedral. Then
through the throng was seen the great dig
nitaries of state, bearing tbe imperial in
signia, regaiia and coronation robes, which
they deposited in richly worked cushions
on a table near tbe throne.
The first of the imperial party to appear
was the Dowager Czarina, mother of the
Emperor, who came separately from the
Emperor and Empress and their attend
ants. The Dowager Empress wore a crown
and imperial mantle, and was accompa
nied by those members of the imperial
family who were not included in the Czar's
cortege and the ladies and officials of her
court.
Immediately after, amid tumultuous
shouts from outside, the Emperor and
Empress appeared at the door. Tney were
received by the clergy and escorted to the
steps of the altar. The Emperor was
dressed in the dark green and gold uni
form of a general of the guards, with high
boots. The Empress was dressed in a sil
ver robe with a long train, which was
borne by four paces. Arriving at the altar
steps the Metropolitan of Moscow and the
Grand Duke Sergius welcomed the Em
peror and Empress in the holy building.
The Metropolitan of St. Petersburg pre
sented tbe cross for them to kiss and the
Metropolitan of Kieff presented them with
the holy water. After bowing three times
before the altar and kissine the sacred im
ages their Majesties ascended the steps
and took their places in front of the altar
with their backs to the throne. The scene
was one of great beauty as the;imperial
couple stood awaiting the service which
was to proclaim them Emperor and Em
press of all the Russias.
The blaze of gold and silver, the bril
liancy of the uniforms and orders, the rich
ness of the Russian court toilettes worn by
the ladies, the sparkling and precious
gems, the clouds of incense rising from be
bink the ikonstas and pervading the
church, the solemn sweetness of the sing
ing which now again began, all contrib
uted to the splendor of tbe occasion. As
the Emperor and Empress entered the
cathedral the choir sang psalm 101, "Mis
ericordiam et judicium cantabo tibi Dom
ine."
The Metropolitan of St. Petersburg, as
the hymn of the choir ceased, stepped for
ward and handed the Emperor a missal,
saying: "Gratias Bpiritus Sancti sit seai
per tecum. Amen." And bidding him
read aloud the orthodox creed, which he
did in a voice audible to all. This was
followed by the reading of the Litany,
with prayers for God's blessing upon the
Czar's government. Tne choirs then
sang "God Is the Lord," with the re
sponse, "Lord Save Thy People."
The Metropolitans of Kieff and St.
Petersburg then assisted the Czar to don
the imperial mantle made of cloth of gold
lined with ermine, which was presented
on two golden cushions by the court cham
berlains.
After donnine the mantle the Emperor
assumed the diamond collar of St. An
drew, the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg
saying: "In nomine Patria et Filius et
Spiritua Sancti. Amen."
Then turning to the altar the Czar
bowed his head to the prelate of Novgorod,
who crossed bis hands upon his Majesty's
forehead and said : "May the Lord anoint
him with tne oil of joy; may he clothe
him with power and place upon bis head
a crown of precious stones of long life;
may he give into his right hand the scep
ter of salvr.tion, set him upon the throne
of righteousness and preserve with his
protection the established rule."
Immediately after this the Czar received
the crown from the Metropolitan of St.
MTEW TOJPAT.

THE BEST NATURAL APERIENT WATER.
Bottled at the UJ HUNYADI Springs, Bodi Pest, Hungary.
Considering the nature of the Hungarian Bitter
Water Springs, it must obviously be desirable for the
medical profession and the public to be assured authori-
tatively that the working of these Springs is carried on
in a scientific manner, and not merely on commercial
lines, and with this view the Uj Hunyadi Springs, from
which " Apenta " Water is drawn, are placed under the
absolute control of the Royal Hungarian Chemical Institute

Petersburg, and, standing in full sight of
all tbe people and still before the altar,
with both bands placed the crown upon
his head. Then taking his scapler, in
which blazed the famous Orloff diamond,
in his right hand and the globe of tbe em
pire in his left, he ascended the dais and
took his seat upon the throne, the Em
press still standing in her former place.
This was the supreme moment of all,
and when gazing around the church and
seeing representatives from nearly every
district of this mighty empire, and behold
ing tbe Czar sitting on his throne of state,
with the symbols of power given to him by
the highest authority in the land, one had
a realizing sense of the great power wielded
by the man in whose honor this great
function was held.
At the moment of taking his seat on the
throne the cannon of the arsenal thun
dered forth, the bells rang and the bands
massed outside playing the national an
them. The Emperor, after merely occu
pying the throne for a few seconds, rose,
and, placing tbe scepter and the globe on
the table by his side, turned to the Em
press, and, taking off his crown, touched
her forehead with it. She then knelt be
fore him on a crimson velvet cushion,
when the Emperor placed upon her head
her own crown, which is surmounted by a
large sapphire.
The Empress' ladies of honor fixed the
crown on her bead with a gold comb and
robed in her mantle of cloth of gold,
ermine lined, like the Emperor's. She was
also invested with the collar of St. Andrew
and was led to the throne by the Emperor
and remained seated at his side.
The Emperor then resumed his scepter
and orb and the clergy broke forth into the
magnificent anthem, "Domine salvum fac
lmperatorem." and "Domine salvum fac
Imperatricem," of course in the old
Blavonic tongue, the choir answering, "Ad
Muitos Annos."
The members of tbe imperial family and
the foreign princes now advanced and con
gratulated the imperial couple, while
others in the church bowed thrice toward
the throne, thus expressing their felicita
tions. Suddenly the cannon, bells and
bands ceased and a solemn silence ensued
when the Czar knelt and solemnly
uttered a fervent prayer. When the
Czar rose from bis knees the Metropolitan
of St. Petersburg began a prayer for the
Eir peror, at which every one in the cathe
dral knelt, with the exception of the Em
peror, who stood erect, wearing his crown.
: The Metropolitan then stepped forward
to the foot ol the dais and made a short
address to the Czar on the importance and
duties of his office. After the Emperor
had taken the scepter from the Metropoli

It is believed that there was not a single

used, and the scene was a most beautiful
one. :
The coronation banquet, which was
given at the Granovitaya Palace to-night,
was a most brilliant affair.
It was attended by the highest nobility,
the representatives of foreign powers and
the Ministers of State. . The Czar, Csarina
and Dowager Czarina sat in a kind of lose
and were waited upon by exalted state of
ficials.
THE LOCAL CELEBRATION.
Interesting Services Held at tbe
Greek Church.
Tbe patriotic Russians of this City at
tended the coronation services in the
Greet church on Powell street yesterday
morning. The chapel was decorated with
flowers, and the American and Russian
colors occupied numerous places within
and without the building.
The religious services were begun by
Bishop Nicholas, clothed in his splendid
vestments of gold and silver embroidery
and crowned with a jeweled mitre. He

was assisted by Archpriest Greencovitch
and Fathers Dimitri and Jacobs. The
liturgy, in Russian, was chanted by the
cantor M. Popoff, assisted by George Mit
ropolsky. Misses Ella and Mamie Dabo
vitch, Misses N. and X. Mitropolsky and
Mrs. Miller.
It was a beautiful and impressive service
and the full-toned choir, singing without
musical accompaniment, filled the pretty
and brilliantly deoorated chapel with a
noble melcdy.
At 11:30 the Te Deum was chanted be
fore the consular corps of the City and
many prominent American citizens, spe
cially invited by his Imperial Russian
Majesty's Consul, V. Artsirnovitch. That
portion of the chapel reserved for the
official guests was decorated with white,
red and blue, the Russian national colors.
Each Consul was in full uniform, making
an imposing military spectacle as they
stood listening to the elaborate ritual of
the Greek Catholic church.
Among the Americans present were
Chief Justice Beatty, Irving M. Scott,
Horace Platt and Edward Jerome. The
Hellenic and Slavonian societies of the
City were represented.
The coronation services proper were de
livered by Bishop Nicholas' a solemn invo
cation of divine blessings for the Em
peror, the ruler of tbe Russias, aud the
head of the Greek church.
At the close of the services in the chapel
the guests were entertained at a banquet
by Consul Artsimovitch and Bishop
Nicholas. The apartment and tables
were handsomely decorated with flowers
and the colors of the two countries. On
the walls were the portraits of the newly
crowned Emperor and Empress as well as
tbe late Emperor and the Dowager
Empress. At the handsome luncheon
provided toasts were drank to the two
sovereigns far away in Moscow, the ancient
capital of all the Russias. It was an im
posing spectacle around Powell and Fil
bert streets with a crowd of carriages at
the church gate and the white, blue and
red of Russia, tbe red, white and blue of
America waving over the green cross
tipped domes.
SUGAR BOUNTY CLAIMS,
Auditor Baldwin Busily at Work
Preparing Certificates of
Verification.
Later On, However, Bowler May
Again Tie Up Some of the
Payments.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.â 1n ac
cordance with yesterday's Supreme Court
decision, Auditor Baldwin of the Treasury
Department had the most experienced of
bis clerks at work to-day verifying bounty
claims embraced in the first section of tbe
bounty law, for which an appropriation of
1238,289 was made.
The claimants are maple-sugar, beet and
cane producers. The amounts in the main
are small, the claimants being such as
were not paid a bounty upon sugar pro-,
duced by them previous to August 28, 1894,
when the McKinley law was repealed.
Auditor Baldwin told the Call corre
spondent that he would put an extra force
of clerks at work on the claims as soon as
possible,, with a view of expediting their
payment. He hopes to he able to dispose
of from 100 *.o 150 claims a day. As a rule
it taies about ten days for tile certi&;Â£.*e
of the Auditor upon which a warrant is
based to reach the Commissioner of Inter
nal Revenue. Auditor Baldwin told the
correspondent that he hoped by diligent
work to be able to dispose of all the claims
of this class by the end of the present fiscal
year, wmen expires June 30. No claims
under the second clause of the county law,
appropriating $5,000,000, have as yet
reached Auditor Baldwin. That clause
makes provision for the compensation of
sugar producers who complied with the
McKinley law by filing notices, etc., prior
to July 1, 1894, and who would have been
entitled to receive a license. These claims,
as a rule, are for large amounts and will
not exceed 600 in number.
The sum provided by Congress will be
inadequate to satisfy * the claims filed, a
deficit of a little over a million being an
ticipated. The work of prorating them,
which has just been agreed upon, will fall
to the lot of the Auditor's office, but how
soon this will be done Mr. Baldwin was
to-day unable to say. Commissioner Mil
ler was also ignorant as to when he would
be able to forward them to the Auditor for
verification and . pro rata. â  This is a very
important matter, for in it lurks an ele
ment of danger to sugar-producers. Unless
these claims or the warrants to satisfy
them . can be . placed in the hands of
Comptroller Bowler before the expiration
of the present fiscal year be will have it in
his power, by a captious ruling, to declare
that the bill carrying the appropriation
for their -payment has lapsed, and he
may refuse to pay them.

ITS FURY IN MICHIGAN,
More Than Forty Persons Killed
and Many Injured in
the Storm.
SCENES OF EOEROR REMAIN.
Hundreds of Homes Reduced to
Splinters During the Pranks
of the Winds.
DETROIT, Mich., May 26.â The cyclone
which devastated the northern portion of
Oakland County last evening swept a path
half a mile wide and sixteen miles long
from west to east, clearing the earth of
nearly everything movable. About forty
persons were killed outright and fully
that number were injured, some of whom
will die.
The cyclone first struck earth bix miles
west of Ortonvilie and passed half a mile
north of that village. In these six miles
of devastated country before Ortonvilie
was reached fifteen persons were killed
and about twenty injured, some fatally.
The first house to feel the effects of the
storm was that of Joshua Johnson. The
storm had not obtained all of its fury and
the building was partially demolished, Mr.
Johnson escaping injury and his wife and
baby being only slightly injured.
A mile further east stood the home and
barns of William Mitchell, not a trace of
which is left but the foundation walls.
Mrs. Mitchell, her son, Claude, and a baby,
Jay Mitchell, nine months old, were in
stantly killed. The father was seriously
bruised and internally injured, and will
probably die. A big sliver was driven
square into the center of his forehead. All
of his stock was killed. Don, another
son. is seriously hurt.
There is nothing but foundations to show
where the home of Abram Quick, who
lived across the way, stood. Six occupants
of the house were killed and one was seri
ously injured. Prescott Wilkins, one of
those killed in the Quick home, had
reached there on a visit but an hour be
fore the cyclone tor its way through.
The home of Henry Flamboy was next
destroyed, and himself, bis wife and two
children seriously injured. A mile east of
Flamboy 's the cyclone demolished the
house of John Porritt. The death list in
in this home reaches four. The wind
cloud passed on and next wrecked the
home of Benjamin Westby. Mr. Westby,
hiÂ» wife and two children were buried in
the w rains, but "were ; , got out with
severe injuries. /
John Frost: was the next victim of the
storm. His bouse was completely wrecked
and his wife seriously hurt.
The home of John Milkie, on a line with
Ortonvilie, was unharmed, but his barns
were wiped out. Mr. Milkie and his son
John, aged 18, were in a barn when it was
demolished. The son was instantly killed
and the father is in a critical condition.
The list of killed and injured in this six
miles is as follows: Mrs. William Mitchell,
Claude Mitchell, her son; J. Mitchell, a
baby son; Abram Quick. Glen Quick, a six
year-old son Myrtle Quick, a four-year
old daughter; : Ross Quick, a baby son;
Mrs. Henry Quick, mother of Abram
Quick; Prescott Wilkins of Mayville, 60
years old ; John Porritt, 75 years old ; Mrs.
Joseph Porritt, his daughter-in-law; Mrs.

fife and two children, not seriously ; Ben
jamin Weatby, wife and two children, not
serious; Mrs. John Prost, seriously; John
Milkie may die; Oscar Granger, tatally;
Mrs. John Whipple, seriously. .
la the next half-dozen miles between
Ortonville and the little settlement of
Oak wood the cyclone seemed to lose some
of its force, or the farmers living in that
section were particularly lucky. The cy
clone traveled the road as straight as an
arrow's flight, spreading out or contract
ing as it went along. '
About 'eighteen farmhouses were de
stroyed In the path of the storm from Or
tonvilie to Oakwood, but only two persons
were killed. Four others ' were probably
fatally injured and eight or ten more or
less seriously hurt. The names of the
dead in this section are Mrs. CJark Eaton
and Ed Fineld.
Fatally injured: Harvey Francis, Mrs.
Ed Fitield, Nelson Chapman. Injured:
Mr. and Mrs. Sylverton Smith and two
children, Mrs. Green, John Clark, Mrs.'
Francis and children.
The cloud struck Oakwood almost with
out warning and there is little left of that
village. The Methodist Episcopal and
Congregational churches, the Town Hall,
practically all the business houses and
most of the residences were left in ruins.
Nine persons were killed in the village and
many injured.
Those who met death were: Mrs. N. B.
Wolverton, Mrs. Ed Howe, Miss Mina
Howe, Orrin Howe (a two-year-old baby),
Mrs. Wells, Eugenia Fifleld, Mrs. Jessie
May Fifield, Labbie Davidson, Mrs. SteV
art, Baby Davis.
Those seriously injured are: Mrs. Kate
Davidson, may die; Bertram Davidson,
may die; George Fifield, leg broken and
knee cap torn off; Will Carr, arm broken
and back wrenched; James Brush, arm
broken ; Mrs. Anna Tinsey of Pontiac,
several ribs broken.
The three-mile stretch from Oakwood to
Thomas is a scene of heartrending desola
tion and wreckage. Everything in the
path of the cyclone was leveled. In and
around Thomas the death list is large and
many are injured. The dead and injured
between Oakwood and Thomas and in the
latter village are:
Deadâ airs. Vanwagoner, Charles Hicks,
Rev. C. M. Pretchyplano, Andrew Petti
grew, M. Bremeyer.
Injured â Leroy Hicks, skull crushed;
William Althouse, internal injuries; Mrs.
R. Coppeman, internally and seriously;
Charles Bradley, arm crushed; Amy Kid
der, crashed by timbers, probably fa
tally; Abram Reed, arm broken; Mrs. A
M. Kidder, badly bruised by debris;
George Hibler, both legs and an arm
broken; Joe , a farmhand employed
by Dr. Suiter, head bruised.
After completing its work of destruction
at Thomas, the cyclone evidently sepa
rated, one section going northeast and do
ing an immense amount of damage be
tween Thomas and Dryden, in Lapeer
County, and the other following a south
westerly direction to North Oxford.
The list of dead at and near North Ox
ford is as follows : Claire E. Laidlaw, three
weeks' old baby; Mrs. Oscar Slade, 36
years old ; Sol E. Rame, Tom Bishop, Jo
seph Smedley Br., Joseph Smedley Jr.,
Mrs. Tnomas Bennett at Dryden ; one un
known man and woman at Whigville.
Injuredâ Neil luathewson, Oscar Slade,
leg broken ; George Besse, head hurt; Will
Allen, cut on head; Mrs. Will Allen,
bruised; Mrs. A. Pettibone, Beverecuts:
Thomas Bennett, three ribs broken, recov
ery doubtful; Mrs. Joseph Smedley Sr.,
probably fatally; Mrs. Joseph Smedley
Jr., slightly injured; John Peters, slightly.
After leaving North Oxford, the path of
the cyclone is marked at intervals until
Mount Clemens is reached, where
great damage was (Jon* and many persons
injured. The inju.ed are: Mrs. Anna
Pohl, a widow, back broken, cannot live;
Henry Pohl, aged 14, hip broken, injured
internally; Adolph Pohl, aged 12, right
leg broken, bruised about shoulders and
body ; Willie Pohl, aged 15, injured inter
nally and right lee broken, recovery doubt
ful; Mrs. Josenh Harder, injured inter
nally, cut about head and arms; Russell
Carter, head and face cut; Mrs. Russell
Carter, injured internally, breast and
shoulders bruised, recovery doubtful;
Baby Carter, head badly cut; Gustavo
Cutche, cut on head and right arm broken ;
Mrs. William Ormsby, left arm broken and
badly cut on face; Miss Anna Belle Teavo,
left arm broken, right arm injured, skull
fractured.
The next heard from this storm is near
Walkerville, Ontario, twenty miles due
south of Mount Clemens. The cyclone
evidently expended its force after striking
Canada, as no other reports of damage
have been received.
After passing Dryden and Whigville, in
Lapeer County, the next heard from the
other storm was in Sanilac County, thirty
miles away, at the village of A mad ore,
which was nearly swept away. The fun
nel-shaped cloud struck a mile west of the
village and in a path half a mile wide and
six and a half miles long, to the shore of
Lake Huron, every building was more
or less damaged.
Tuscaio County was also visited by a
windstorm of cyclonic violence last even
ing. Nearly every building in the path of
the storm, which started near Gilford and
traveled directly east for six miles, was
destroyed. Joseph Mabelburg was hit by
a flying board and instantly killed.
August, Julius, Fred and Edward Haske,
Mrs. Julius Haske ana Mrs. Urbane were
more or less seriously injured.

Havoc and Death Caused by the Storm
in lowa. -
DES MOINES, lowa, May 26.â re
ports from the storm-stricken country in
this and Jasper counties which have been
received to-day indicate that the storm's
havoc is even worse than was at first sup
posed. The property loss is much larger
than :tV3B'iSrought: tV3B'iSrought to be yesterday. r Xne^
list of dead is now over a score, and it is
probable there will be five or six more
deaths, as there are a number of victims
in a critical condition.
Mrs. ; Charles , Phelan of Valeria is ex
pected to die at any time. She.was the
mother of the Charles Phelan family, six
of whose nine members are now dead.
Their funerals were held to-day at Valeria,
and the six coffins were buried in the same
grave, in the presence of an immense
throng of people. Mrs. Schell, who lives
at the home of William Osborne, has died
of her injuries. The others of the Osborne
family will recover. Mrs. Celia Whitney
has died. She was an aged lady and very
poor. She lived with Mr. and Mrs. Dong
las Akin, who had a child killed.
Relief parties were sent through the dis
trict to-day from Dcs Moines and Colfax
and public meetings will be held here to
morrow to raise funds to help the desti
tute.
Fully two score of homes have been
wiped out of existence; in every case
there is no salvage at all. Some of the
families are very poor and it will be neces
sary to raise several thousand dollars.
Most of the property damaged was north
east of Valeria in Jasper County. The
Supervisors of Polk and Jasper counties
will meet to-morrow to appropriate funds
for the relief work.

Ha* Hilled.
HUNTSVILLE, Tex,, May 26.â What
came near being a serious outbreak at the
penitentiasy occurred Sunday night at 10
o'clock. Quince Wilkerson, 30 years old,
unlocked bis cell and then released four
others. They repaired to the window in
the east wall and to a solid bar of iron at
tached a dynamite bomb or cartridge and
attempted to light it, but it failed to work.
A guard on the outside, seeing the men
in the corridor, demanded their surrender
and began tiring on them. C. A. Alexan
der, a guard, seeing a man running to
ward him poked his gun through the bars
and fired. The entire load of buckshot en
tered Quince Wilkerson's body, killing him
instantly.
The others all scampered down the posts
and got into their cells. The bomb ex
ploding would probably have wrecked tbe
east wall and killed many men, but the
prison wall yet remained to be overcome
before the outside was reached.
SAMUEL PENCE'S DUAL LIFE.
Story of Duplicity Revealed by a Petition
Application,
TOLEDO, Ohio, May 26.â Investigation
of the application for a pension of Mrs.
Frederics Pence of this city brought to
light yesterday * the dual life of Samuel
Pence, who recently died here. It showed
that Pence has for more than thirty years
concealed from his second wife the fact
that . within twenty miles - from < Toledo
there lived a woman to whom he was
legally married and - from whom he had
never been divorced; that during, those
thirty years, while rearing a family of five
children here, he had two sons growing up
in Cleveland, the result of the first mar*
r iaee, and who now reside in the Foest
City with their mother. When Pence
came here - from Cleveland l which was
shortly after he had served his term of en
listment in a regiment that participated in
the rebellion, he had a friend Write to his
wife :" that he had died in Goshen, Ind.
Mr =>. Pence No. 1 accepted the statement
without question and never made ; . any in

Mrs. Pence followed. J

CONVERTED INTO A
REVENUE MEASURE,
An Amendment Tacked on
to Sherman's Filled
Cheese Bill.
EXTRA TAX ON BEER.
Dubois' Method for Making Up
the Amount of the Pres
ent Deficiency.
LOSS OF A MOTIOW TO TABLE IT.
Final Conference Report on the Legis
lative, Executive and Judicial
Appropriations Agreed To.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.â The
House measure known as the "filled
cheese" bill came up before the Senate to
day under the lead of Senator Sherman,
who reported it from the Senate Commit
tee on Finance. Its object is to discourage
the manufacture and sale of an adulter
ated article of food by imposing a heavy
license on manufacturers and wholesale
dealers, and its supporters advocated its
passage, not as a revenue measure, but as
a protection to dairymen and the general
public.
After a couple of pension bills had been
passed unanimous consent was asked by
Sherman (R.) of Ohio to take up the filled
cheese bill, but objection was made by
Harris (D.) of Tennessee, who said no
agreement could be made about that bill.
The request for unanimous consent was
thereupon changed by Sherman into a
motion to take up the bill, and that mo
tion was agreed to â ayes 36, noes 14.
The filled-cheese bill was then taken up,
and an amendment was offered to it by
Dubois (R.) of Idaho to impose an addi
tional tax of 75 cents a barrel on beer.
Sherman moved to lay the amendment
on the table, which was defeated Dy a vote
of 25 to 30.
The amendment being before the Senate,
Vilas opposed it, declaring that if the Sen
ators desired to kill a meritorious bill â a
bill to prevent the constant and continued
perpetration of injurious and shameful
frauds on farmersâ the adoption of the
amendment was a very skillful means to
defeat it utterly and entirely.
Cubois referred to the situation as a lu
dicrous one. Senators were censured be
cause they could not agree to reduce reve
nue, but those who expressed their disgust
were those who would raise revenue only
in their own way.
Mills advocated the amendment and
criticized the position of Vilaa.
Without action on the beer amendment
the filleo-cheeseibill went over and Butler's
bond bill was taken up, Pritchard (B.) of
North Carolina addressing the Senate.
Quoting from Sherman's speech in tne last
Congress against tbe use of the "resump
tion fund" for ordinary expenditures, he
said nothing had occurred to change his
mind since that speech was made. The
misapplication of public funds had to be
prevented, and there were only two ways
to prevent it. One way was to pass an
emergency protective tariff measure, and
the other was to take from the Secretary of
tne Treasury the power to issue bonds ana
increase the public debt when there was no
necessity for such conduct.
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky opposed the
bond bill, expressing the belief that its
passage would result in a suspension of
specie payments within sixty days.
At the close of Lindsay's speech the
bond bill went over without action.
The conference report on the legislative
appropriation bill was explained by Cul
lom (R.) of Illinois. The Senate amend
ment in regard to register of copyrights,
he said, had been receded from. The
amendment fixing the time for the meet
ing of the New Mexico Legislature on the
Ist of July, 1896, had been changed so as
to make the time the 30th of June, 1897.
The provision as to tbe Attorney-General
designating where United States commis
sioners are to be appointed had been
changed so as to give the authority to the
District Judge, and the provision as to
deputy clerks of United Btates courts had
been changed so as to allow the deputy
clerKs of circuit or district courts to act
as commissioners with tbe approval of
the judge.
The conference report on the sundry
civil appropriation bill was presented and
explained by Allison (R.) of lowa. Alli
son stated the position of tbe. House con
ferees in opposition to the increase of limit
of cost of public buildings. That was the
case in relation of buildings in Kansas
City, Mo ; , Omaha and other places. The
House conferees also disputed the amend

SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
He pea I of a Section, of th* Wilton Bill
Relating to Alcohol for Arts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 26.â Witn
an amendment the House to-day by a vote
of 165 to 69 passed the bill repealing sec
tion 61 of the Wilson tariff bill of 1894,
which provides for free alcohol iv the arts
â¢nd manufactures.
The affirmative vote was composed C\
104 Republicans, 56 Democrats and 5 Pop
ulists, the negative vote of 60 Republicans
and 9 Democrats. The amendment was
adopted as revised by the Committee ou
Ways and Means, providing for the ap
pointment of a joint committee of three
Senators* and three Representatives to sit
during the recess and investigate the sub
ject and report at the next session of Con
gress.
There was vigorous opposition to the
bill by many States in the interest of
manufacturers, but the opposition were un
aDle to muster enough votes to defeat it.
The House disagreed to all the Senate
amendments, to the general deficiency ap
propriation bill referring to the Bowman
act. As to the claims contained in this
act it was decided to pass upon them to
morrow. The Indian appropriation bill
was presented and agreed* to.
The Presidents veto of the bill for the
relief of B. F. Jones, ex-postmaster at
Beauregard, Mass., was read and referred
to the Committee on Claims.
The contest of Johnson (R.) vs. Stokes

rftESH PROOF OF GUILT.
Clothing Taken From One of
His Victims Distributed
as Presents.
ONE BODY IS SHIPPED AWAY.
Detectives Claim That They Can Con
vict the Salt Lake Murderer
if Captured.
SALT LAKE, Utah, -May 28.â The de
velopments in thÂ« Scandinavian church
murders were meager to-day compared
â with yesterday. The search in the church
for the remains of Miss Samuelson proved
fruitless and tbe officers have come to the
conclusion that whatever the murderer
may have done with the body, it is not
in or about the church. Other develop
ments go to chow that the pastor disposed
of the clothing of Miss Bamueison in
various ways.
The Rev. Mr. Ellefson of Ephraim, of
this State, says that Mr. Hermans visited
with his family a few days prior to his
tinal departure from Salt Lake, on May
H. and then said that he was anxious that
Mrs. Ellefson should have some articles
of remembrance of Hermans' deceased
wife and asked her to accept as such
a quantity of ladies' underclothing.
The developments of the past few days
lead Mr. Eliefson to examine these gar
ments minutely, when he found that they
â¢were all marked with the initials "A. K.
iS." those of Miss Anna K. Samuelson.
It also appears that Hermans presented a
number of handkerchiefs to Mrs. Mork,
wife of Presiding Elder Mork of Brigharu
City, before he left for the East, and some
of these also bear the initials "A. K. S."
It has also been learned that on Febru
ary 18, about three weeks after Miss Sam
uelbon disappeared. Rev. Mr. Hermans paid
a visit to Butte, Mont-, and that he took
with him two heavy trunks, on which he
paid excess baggage. A letter was to-day
leceived from Rev. Mr. Melbv, Scandinav
ian Methodist minister at Butte, by Presid
ing Eider Mork, stating that Hermans sold
a trunic and a quantity of ladies' under
clothing when he was in Butte at that
time. These .circumstances confirm the
detectives' theory that Hermans mur
dered Miis Samuelson and shipped the re
mains in a iarge wooden box which he
had made about the time she disappeared.
in regard to Miss Clauson, the officers
declare that there is no longer a shadow
of a doubt that Hermann is her murderer.
They say that never before have they been
able to forge co complete and strong a
chain of' circumstantial evidence in any
case of great concern as in this. The po
lice here incline to the belief that Her
mans is hiding in Chicago, and Rev. Mr.
Mork says he had friends in tbe western
part of that city.
Governor Wells to-day offered a reward
of $500 for the capture of the preacher, and
private subscriptions to about an equal
amount have been sent in, so that the
price on the pastor's head is about $1000
and increasing.
Dentist Keyser ha* identified the teeth
found among the ashes in the furnace in
the church basement as being identical
with those he made for Mias Clauson in
1891.
m
WAS SEEN IN CHICAGO.
Hen^ant Belter rd to Be in Biding at
the Lake City.
CHICAGO, 111., May 26.â Rev. Francis
Hermans, tbe Salt Lake preacher wanted
in that city, was in Chicago last Saturday
and is believed to be here still. On Satur
day evening a travel-stained man carrying
a grip and answering to the description of
Hermans was seen at the corner of Sixty
fourth street and Stoney Island avenue.
The local police have been notified that
Hermans was seen, and Captain Snippy
and his men are scouring their district in
the hope that he has not departed.
Hermans is a striking-looking man and
easy to identify. He has red hair and red
mustache, wears goid eye-glasses, clerical
garb and speaks with an accent. Men in
tbe garb of priest, with red hair and gold
eye-glasses are not uncommon, hut when
a red mustache is added to this the com
bination is very rare.
The man who was at Stoney Island ave
nue and Sixty-fourth street answered in
every detail the description of Hermans.
He was travel-stained and carried a small,
battered gripsack. That he was an abso
lute stranger in Chicago he proved when
be stopped a man and asked him the bent
and quickest and cheapest way to get to
South Chicago. Then he asked if the elec
tric cars going to South Chicago and West
Pullman were not the best for Mm to take.
He was told that the Alley "L" at Sixty
third and Stoney Island was the route
which met his requirements, and seemed
surprised. He did not go to the "L" sta
tion directly, however, but merely thanked
the man he had asked for the information
and remained standing at the corner. He
was there half an hour later.

LIGHTING WITHOUT WIRES
Wonderful Electrical Inventions
Being Made by Tesla
and Edison.
The Introduction of a More Perfect
Illuminant Is Now Neai
at Hand.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 28.â The Eiec
trical Review in its last issue announced
by authority that Nikola Tesla had per
fected his vacuum-tube system of electric
lighting without wires, the possibilities of
which he first brought to public notice
| about five years ago in a lecture beforp the
! American Institute of Electrical Engi
neers. This light is whiter, more brilliant
and more intense than the arc light and is
produced with a much smaller amount of
electrical energy. A laboratory photo
! graph has been made by means of this
light with an exposure of only two sec
onds. The details in the photograph are
remarkably fine. Tesla states that his ap
paratus has been greatly simplified and be
will soon have it ready for practical use.
Working on different lines, Thomas A.
Edison has, according to the Electrical
Review, to be published to-morrow, suc
ceeded in developing a new kind of electric
lamp or vacuum tube, by means of which
j the Roentgen X rays are turned into pure
white light. Edison's new lamp is an
ordinary Crookes tube, coated on the in
terior surface with crystals of a new fluor
escing substance which fie has discovered,
| some of tungstate of culcium. The X rays
in passing through this coating of crystals
are changed -to light. Very little heat is
1 generated, and nearly the whole of the
j electrical energy expended is transformed
into light. Tlie new lamp is used in place
| of a Crookes tube, with the ordinary X ray
J apparatus.
Mr. Edison believes that there are great
possibilities in his discovery, and is now
enthusiastically at work perfecting his ap
paratus in to commercial form. He expects
that before long he will so develop ii that
it may be used with high economy on an
ordinary incandescent circuit.
Electrical and scientilic people are
eagerly watching the outcome of the work
of these two great inventors on this im
portant subject, ffhe Electrical Review
says editorially: "We cannot hesitate to
express our positive conviction that the
introduction of a more perfect illuminant
is near at hand."

PITTSBURG, Pa., May 26.â During the
day and to-night many delegates to the
National Prohibition Convention, which
opens here to-morrow, held caucuses and
selected coin mit tee men.
At a general conference of the delegates
who favor a broad-gauge platform it was
decided to push (J. Â£. Bentley of Nebraska
for President; J. H. Southgate of North
Carolina for Vice-President and T. B.
Logan of Ohio for chairman of the Na
tional Committee, At the meeting of the
National Committee A. A. Stevens of
Pennsylvania was elected temporary chair
man. He is anti-free silver.
Indications point to an exceedingly ex
citing convention in tbe appearance of
that bugbear of all political conventions â
the question of the free coinage of silver as
a plail'orm plunk. There are two factions
in the Prohibition party, and they are
styled "broad-gauge" and "narrow-gauge."
Between these factions a wordy warfure
has takun place in the party press.
A number of candidates are being act
ively groomed for the Presidential nomi
nation. Rhode Island will present the
nameof rion. Henry B. Metcalf; Maryland,
that of Joshua Leveriug; Neb a-ka, Charles
E- Buntlev; Texas, J. B. Cranliil; Ohio.

j asked about the itoxy told by T. B.
Haughawout of Carthage, Mo., that mem
bers of the advisory board got $5000 for the
stand they took against McKinley and
were to get $ 10,000 in the event of the de
feat, lie said:
"1 don't know why Mr. Haugtiawout
has fought me so bitterly, except that he
went to Canton and saw'McKitiley."
'â¢Is it true, as he says, that the com
mittee got money for condemnation of
McKinley?"
"Not a bit of it. When I see him I shail
| get an explanation or know tbe reason
why."
"Will the right that has been made on
McKinley have any effect now ihat the
order has gone back on the committee?"
"No, that settles all opposition. Indi
vidual members may do as they please,
and there are plenty of them who have no
r.?e for McKinley. They are not satisfied
with his Americanism. That will have its
effect in the convention. It may also be
felt after the convention."

BISHOPS CONSECRATED.
An Imposing Ceremony in the
Methodist Episcopal Church
at Buffalo.
1 Closing Topics Discussed Before the
Members of the General
Conference.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 26â Charles
Cardwell McCabe, Earl Cran=ton and Jo
beph Crane Hartzell were consecrated as
Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church
at Central Armory this morning. There
was an immense congregation present,
nearly every seat in the Dig auditorium
being filled. The consecration was most
impressive.
At 11:10 a. m. the Bishops of the chnrch,
the Bishops-elect and those assisting in
the ceremony filed in and took their seats
on the platform. Bishop Bowman, the
beloved senior Bishop, who has served the
church in that capacity since 1832, pre
sided. The collect was recited by Bishop
Vincent, the epistle was read by Bishop
Thoburn anil the gospel by Bishop Taylor.
The Rev. L. D. McCabe, D.D., and the
Rev. T. C. Iliff presented Bishop-elect Ale-
Cabe; the Rev. D. L. Rader and the Rev.
R. 8. Rust presented Earl Cranston ;
Joseph Crane Hartzell was presented by
the Hey. M. C. B. Mason and the Rev.
Samuel L. Berler. Alter prayer by Bishop
Fitzgerald of New Orleans the examina
tion and invocation was conducted by
Bishop Andrews. It was the most solemn
part of the service. Every voice in tho
armory was hushed and every ear strained
to Â« utch the questions of the Bishop and
the answers of the candidates.
Then followed the "laying on of hands"
and presentation of the Bible. The con
gregation sang a hymn and the benedic
tion was pronounced by Bishop Foster.
People flocked from all parts of the
house to congratulate the newly made
Bishops, and the platform was crowded
for a long time with a surging crowd of
enthusiastic Methodists eager to greet
those who were to guide the destinies of
a religious force which numbers over
3,000,000 souls.
The General Conference was presided
over by Bishop Ninde this morning. The
judiciary committee reported and the con
ference acted on a large number of ap
peals.
Charles W. Price of Russellville Circle
(Ouio), convicted of lying, appealed from
a decision of Bisnop Bowman.
The conference reversed the Bishop's
decision and ordered a nÂ«?w trial.
V.'hen the celebrated Baltimore amend
ment was before the annual conference
the New York East Conference refused to
act on it and the committee recommended
that no appeal be ent&rtained.
A committee of live was appointed on
complimentary resolutions.
The committee ou book concern wanted
the conference to appoint a book editor
and it was so ordered.
To-night had been set aside for the an
niversary of the temperance work, and the
auditorium was decorated accordingly, a
large banner inscribed, "The Baloon Must
Go," hanging at one end of the building.
The decision of the conference to hold an
evening session for business spoiled the
plan for a great temperance rally, but the
rules were suspended and the first thirty
minutes were given over to the temper
ance organization.
The regular order, the report of the com
mittee on constitution, was then taken up.
There was quite a long debate over the
manner of constituting special sessions of
the general conference, the issue arising
between those who held that for members
of the preceding General Conference to hold
over and sit in the special session would
bo unconstitutional, and those who held
that new members must be chosen. The
former prevailed and the article was
adopted.
There was 8 sharp debate over an at
tempt to give laymen equal rights with
the ministerial delegates to preside pro
tern. over a General Coaference in case
there is no Bishop present to preside. One
amendment looking to that end was
tabled, but Mr. Buckley introduced an
other and made a strong speech favoring
the acknowledgment of the laymen's
rights to preside.
Dr. Neely opposed the amendment and
thought, that ho reference should be made
to the order from which the president pro
tern. should be selected. This view finally
prevailed, the reference being stricken out
and the section adopted. Adjourned.
BEFORE THE PREMMYTEEIANS.
Interesting tiubj*ets Considered at the
General Assembly.
SARATOGA, N. V., May 26. -The Pres
byterian General 'Asicmbly opened, as
usual this morning with the report of
Chairman Booth of the committee on
bills and overtures. The next important
bill before the committee is the one in re
gard to the New York Presbytery, which
disobeyed the order of last year's assem
bly in receiving students from the Union
Theological Seminary. The \ committee
decided to refer the matter to the commit
tee on church polity.
Dr. Montlort, chairman : of the judicial
committee, made its report, assigning four
of the cases before it to special commis
sions for trial, and Rev. Dr. Kane of In
diana, chairman, read the report of the
home mission.-; committee. His . resolu
tions proposed radical changes in the dis
tribution of the funds of the board. These
were to the effect that' moneys for home
mission work were to be distributed ac
cording to the direction of the presbyteries
in whose jurisdiction the assisted churches
were located. The sums thus distributed
were to be determined by the exchange of
reports between the board and the pres
byteries, and the apportionment recom
mended by the presbyteries was to be final.
A second resolution recommended a
thorough scrutiny of the methods of the
board of home missions. The re-election
of the following trustees of the home
board was recommended: Thomas Nel
eon, Brooklyn; J. M. I.udlow ,and -G. 11'
spinning, O7unjie, N. J.; Elders Job S.
Kennedy, John F. Parsonsand H. E. How
land, New York, and Charles E. Greene,
Princeton.
, Speeches were then made on the home
mission report by Secretary â  McMillan,
President Dr. John Hall, Trustee J. S.
Ramsey of New York,- Dr. Agnew of Phil
adelphia, Dr. Hubburd of Auburn and
others and the rtcommendations'adopted.*
At the; afternoon session Chairman

STRIVING FOR A
SAN JOSE ESTATE,
Mrs. Parker's Contest for
Her Father-in-Law's
Fortune.
WAS HE WEAK-MINDED 1
A Witness Tells of the Old
Man's Faith in Spirit
Mediums.
MRS. LAW'S POOR MEMORY
Fails to Recall Certain Incidents and
Conversations She Formerly
Testified To.
SAN JOSE. Cal., May 26.â At the call
ing of the Parker will contest this morn
ing both sides presented authorities as to
whether the testimony of Mrs. Helen Law
yesterday afternoon regarding the contents
of a letter Mrs. Parker had read to her
was admissible. The court sustained the
objection and ruled that the evidence was
not admissible.
By consent of the court and counsel for
respondents Fred P. Evans, a slate-writing
medium of San Francisco, was the first
witness this morning. He said his profes
sion was that of a psychographist, which,
be explained, meant a soul-writer. He
recognized the photograph of Parker as
that of a man with whom he had frequent
sittings in 1891, 1892 and 1893.
He said Parker was a believer in spiritu
alism and anxious to develop medium
ehip and had visited him for that purpose.
He had given the deceased instructions as
o how to develop as a psychographist.
On one occasion Parker was accompanied
by a blond lady and they were both
deeply interested in the subject.
Evans said he produced many slate
writings through his mediumship for
Parker, and then explained the process of
putting two clean elates together with a
piece of pencil between them. The inves
tigator would hold the slates together to
impart the individuality, and magically
the writing would appear. This writing
would be a message from some one who
has passed beyond.
Two slates were offered and Evans iden
tified them as coming from him and being
some of the many which Parker took from
his parlors. The introduction of the slates
in evidence was denied, as they had no
bearing on the will.
Mrs. Law was recalled and subjected to
a severe cross-examination by Mr. Delmas.
She was shown a letter she wrote to Jane
Pomeroy in 1893 and asked to state its
contents. There was an objection to this
question, and it was stated by Mr. Delmas
that it was simply asked as a test of the
memory of the witness.
Judge Patterson said the witness should
not be called upon to give the substance
of any letter that she had ever written.
"I could not do that myself," said he.
"Of coOrse the learned counsel would
not pretend to do such a thing, " replied
Mr. Delmas, "and at the same time I do
not think that he would undertake to re
late npon the witness- tand the entire sub
stance of a letter that ne read over twenty
years ago, as this witr.ess claimed to be
able to do to-day."
The objection to the question was then
overruled and it transpired that Mrs. Law
had no idea of the contents of a letter that
Bhe had written to Jane Pomeroy less than
three years ago.
'â¢1 understand that Marshall Pomeroy
was left a good part of his estate under the
will. Ido not feel bitter against him be
cause he brought suit against me and my
husband to recover the |2000. 1 have ex
pressed no such bitterness," she declared.
"In giving my deposition at Oakland I
said I believed it was a piece of persecu
tion by the executors, stimulated by
Marshall Poineroy and his sister, when
the suit to recover the $2000 was brought
against my husband and myself. George
Parker once saia he wanted to have what
he accumulated to go to his own flesh and
blood. I cannot remember exactly when
and where it was he said it.
"It was brought up when he was speaking
of his property. He said he did not want
the property to go to the Pomeroys. This
is the hrst time I have testified to that.
He said he did not want his son's wife to
have anything. He said that two or three
times in three or four years."
Mrs. Law's memory was again subjected
to a test. She had testified positively that
she could remember the substance of
all the ideas in the letter that she had
r ad over twenty years ago. She was now
asked to again repeat the substance of the
letter, the same as she had done a few
moments before upon direct examination.
The witness now hesitated and was evi
dently embarrassed. She said :
"I nave already repeated what I remem
ber of that letter."
"But I would like to have you repeat it
apain," said Mr. Delmas.
After some deliberation Mrs. Law began
to repeat the letter again. She added a
number of points and left out several that
she had given before. She stated that
Jane Pomeroy said that Ed Parker was
' unhappy, that Jane Fomeroy was ashamed
of Mrs. Ed Parker, and then recognizing
that she had made some blunders she took
refuge in the all-embracing term of "and
so forth."
"But the words 'and so forth' were not
in the letter, were they?" was asked.
"They were not," replied the witness.
"I cannot give you any more of it now, I
am tired."
"If that is the case," said Mr. Delmas
smilingly addressing the court, "1 cannot
continue the cross-examination of this
witness further now. An attorney is dis
armed when a lady on the witness-stand
tells him she is tired."
"We sympathize with the witness," said
Judge Spencer. "It is a very warm day.
Perhaps it would be as well to adjourn
now."
An adjournment was taken till this
morning at 10 o'clock.
ELOPED WITH A. DRUMMER.
Rancher Stockdale of ban Miguel in
Punuit of Hi* Wife.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 26.â C. A. Stock
dale, a rancher near San Miguel, San Luis
Obispo County, was in this city to-day
looking for his wife, who, he claims, ran
away three weeks ago with F. L. Merrill,
h clothing-drummer of San Francisco. He
says his wife deserted him about a year
ago for Merrill, but subsequently returned
home and all was forgiven. Three weeks
ago sho again left home, taking their
three-year-old son with her.
The couple were located in San Fran
cisco, but when Stockdale arrived they
had left. Stockdale says he is not very
anxious to recover his wife, but he wants
to gain possession of his boy and Bettle
things with Merrill.
STOLEN JEWELS RECOVERED.

SAN JOSE, Cal., May 2Â«.â A. Sanchez,
a Mexican who has been disposing of con
siderable jewelry in Chinatown of late,

James street, and Mrs. J. R. Bartruff, 190
South Seventh.
Mrs. Bartruff identified Sanchez as a
man she caught in the act of ransacking
her home on May 7, and this afternoon
she swore to a complaint before Justice
Glass charging him with burglary.
SEARCHING FOR HER -SON.
An Aged Woman Wander* From Her
Home in Calarrras County.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 26.â A feeble
minded old woman, giving the name of
Louise Jane Simmons, is held at the
County Jail. This morning the woman
went to the residence of W. M. Berry, on
San Salvador street, near the narrow
gauge, and inquired foi her son,
Charles Simmons. She seemed bewildered
and lost and Mr. Berry notified the Sher
iff's office and she was taken in charge.
The woman said she came to' this city a
week ago from Calaveras County in search
of her son, but has been unable to find
him. She said her home was at the corner
of Folsom street and Mokelunine Hill.
She is about 70 years of age and a native
of New Hampshire.

SANTA ROSA'S CONGRESS
Miss Shaw Addresses . a Large
Audience on the Rights
of Women.
Mrs. Fannie McG. Martin, Attorney-at-
Law, Gives a Professional
Talk.
SANTA RO3A, Cal., May 26.â The feat
ure of the afternoon session of the Woman
Suffrage Convention to-day was a paper
by Mrs. Fannie McG. Martin entitled,
"Does the Professional Woman Need the
Ballot?" Mrs. Martin was formerly Su
perintendent of Schools for Sonoma Coun
ty and is now practicing law here. She
spoke from the standpoint of a profes
sional woman. Her paper was largely
argumentative, but logical and keen.
Theology, medicine and law, she said,
were the three principal professions, and
their ranks were now honored by many
women who had to pass the same exami
nations as the men to get there. These
professional women did not ask for any
easier conditions than those imposed upon
the men, but they did ask for the same
privileges. She paid a nice compliment to
Mrs. Clara Shortridge Foltz, the famous
woman lawyer now practicing in New
York. Quoting the law which provides
that women should have an equal right
with the men to practice law, the speaker
declared it to be ridiculous that they
should have no voice in making the laws
or selecting the judges before whom they
had to practice. She closed with an ap
peal to parents to encourage their daugh
ters to adopt a professional career.
Judging from the great crowds that at
tended the previous meetings the lady
managers concluded that the M. E. Church
would no t hold all the people who desired
to hear Rev. Anna H. Shaw, and the Athe
nseum was engaged. Fully 1500 people
were present when the Hon. John Tyler
Campbell of this city introduced the
speaker of the evening. The introductory
speech was quite brief, and predicted the
ultimate success of the equal suffrage
movement. The speaker, who is noted for
saying graceful things about the ladies,
was evidently sincere in this instance,
when he declared that the women of the
country possessed the larger share of its
intelligence and that it was only a ques
tion of time when they would take their
places at the bar of civil and political
equality.
Miss Shaw enlisted the sympathy of the
big audience at the outset, and at times
handled i.er subject without gloves. With
that peculiar grace and power that has
made her famous throughout the country,
she enlightened her hearers and exploded
the pet arguments of the opposers of the
proposed innovation.
These overturnings of time-frayed mas
culine objections were received with de
light and applauded by the 1000 or more
ladies present, and will be used in family
conventions by many a Santa Rosa maid
and matron during the coming campaign.

Methods for Gaining
Recruits.

Advises Greater Liberality in the
Cause of the Heathen
Hordes.
DR. DILIE ON LEADERSHIP.
Educated Young Men Christ's Strongest
Yeomen â A Sermon on the
Mount.
CAZADERO, Cal., May 26.â A change
was made to-day from the regular order
of the course of the Intercollegiate Y. M.
C. A. Conference, the president's confer-
I ence takins the place of the missionary in- ]
! stitute. This meeting was led by C. 0. |
Micbener, and after he had laid down a
well-conceived plan for the carrying on of i
the president's work, general discussion
followed on the features which had been of
advantage to the several associations. In
appointing the various committees Mr.
; Micbeneradvised that the president should
I have one or two inexperienced men named
in order to work them in; that the presi
dent should get the personal consent of
each man to serve; that vacancies should i
be left on committees, and lastly that if a i
i man would not work some one who would
! should be substituted.
Mr. Beaver's class in Bible study was
next on the day's programme. Consider- ;
j able interest is being manifested in the !
i department of this class, which deals with
the discussion of methods for getting men
to make a stand for Christ.
Sherwood Eddy's talk was on the need of
the Young Men's Christian Association
teaching liberality to missions. He advised
that each college support one of its gradu
ates in the foreign field, or, if this was
impossible, write to one of the missionary
boards and get from it the name of a mis
sionary they could support abroad. Mr.
Eddy said that it took all the pleasure out
of a glass of soda water for him when he
i found that a missionary could be sup
j ported in India for 7 cents a day. He
gave suggestions for the raising of money
in the colleges, and closed bis remarks
j with Mr. Steams' motto, "Ask God and
the people; don't ask the people."
One important factor in the success
I which nas been attendant upon the con
ference is that all the periods of class
work, and in fart all the meetings, are be
j gun and ended with prayer.
The students had been expecting a great
treat to-day, when Dr. Dille would speak
to them. The good doctor did not disap
j point bis hearers. His theme in the morn
ing was the leadership of educated men.
I He said young men represented potential
j energy raised to its highest power. Re-
I forms and revolutions, said Disraeli, were
| the work of young men. When Christ
â  wished to accomplish any great work he
i chose not tne Simeons with the setting sun
jin their faces, but the Pauls. Educated
I young men were to be the conservative as
| well as the constructive factors of the
i world.
The speaker closed by exhorting the
young to open every avenue of their hearts
| to God and let his power come in to mane
i them leaders for good in tire world.
The students, together with C. C. Mich
j ener and Bherwood Eddy, visited Pole
| Mountain, about four miles away, in the
\ afternoon. When the summit was reached
j Mr. Eddy gave one of the life-work talks,
j showing the needs of the foreign fields in
! a manner that impressed all the men.
in the evening Dr. Dille igain spoke. His
â  remarks were based on the first chapter of
Revelation and the eighteenth verse, "I
am he that liveth and was dead and be
hold I am alive forevermore."
This has been the hottest aav during the
conference, but it has not in any way de
tracted from the interest.
REINDEER FOR ALASKA.

SEATTLE, Wash., May 26.â Miner W.
Bruce, author and explorer, who has a

he threatened the lives of the yonng
couple, and a brother of the girl, fearing
trouble, removed the powder from the
shells of three pistols which Reheiser kept
in his bureau.
After the quarrel this morning Reheiser
procured one of his pistolÃ and fired twice
at the girl. Knowing the condition of the
shells sue laup.hed at him. Reheiser pro
cured another pistol and shot twice again
with no effect. Then be rushed into bis
bedroom and got a rifle. The girl and her
mother jumped through a window and
ran for the neighboring hills.
The crazed lover fired one shot from the
Winchester, barely missing the gin as she
was going over a hill. Tnen he went to
his bedroom, put the muzzle of a shotgun
to bis forehead and fired, the charge car
rying away the top of his head.
Reheiser was 51 years old. He had been
foreman of the railway roundhouse hen*
for ten years and lived with Mrs. Cromp
ton for the past seven years. His wife
lived near Hilarita. The suicide had been
drinking heavily of late.

Office of Lieutenant-
Governor.
SEEKS A COURT TEST.
Uiless Mandamused He Will
Omit That Place in His Elec
tion Proclamation.
THE CASE MADE A PRECEDENT
The Tenure of Superior Judge Carter
of Fresno to Be Similarly
Extended.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 26.â When
Governor Budd issues his election pro
clamation this fall, the people of the State
Will fail to receive official notice that any
vacancy has occurred in the office of Lieu
tenant-Governor through the death of
Millard; nor will any notice be taken of
the fact that one of the SaDerior Judges of
Fresno having joined the great majority
his position has been filled by tne appoint
ment of Stanton L. Carter, unless the
Supreme Court, through the issuance of a
writ ot mandamus, compels his Excellency
to appear before it and show cause why
he fails to recognize these vacancies.
Should the writ fail of issuance, W. T.
Jeter wili continue to occupy the office of
Lieutenant-Governor, and Carter the posi
tion of Su perior Judge of Fresno^County,
the Supreme Court Laving in the past de
cided that any office not included in the
Oovernor's proclamation cannot be tilled
by election of the people.
Several months ago, as published at the
time in The Call, Governor Budd stated
that he was not sure but that Jeter could
hold over on his appointment, and that it
would not be necessary to declare that a
vacancy existed in the office of Lieutenant-
Governor. The matter has again been
brought to his notice by a letter received
yesterday from Judge Paterson of San
Francisco, presumably making inquiries
as to what action the Governor would take
this fall in re.ard to tbe alleeed vacancy
in the superior jud;:eship of Fresno
County. When questioned upon the sub
ject to-day the Governor said :
"I have fully made up my mind not to
declare any vacancies in either the office
of Lieutenant Governor or Superior Judge ;
in fact, I will fail to mention either office
in my election proclamation, unless man
damus proceedings are commenced to
compel me to do so. 1 s!al! probably be
asked to announce such vacancies, but
will refuse.
"Then steps can be taken in mandamus
and this mooted question can be settled
for all time by a decision of the Supreme
Court. 1 want to tay that 1 have no self
ish motive to subserve in taking such
action, although I admire Jeter greatly.
My object is to place the matter in such a
form as will allow it to be brought before
the Supreme Court."
"Will you state the nature of the letter
you forwarded in answer to Jud^e Pater
soii's query?"
"No, 1 must refuse to do so," answered
the Governor, "as to a certain extent it is
personal yet. But I will most emphati
cally state that I will not include any an
nouncements of vacancies filled by
appointments unless compelled to do so.''
The Governor suggested to Judge Pater
son that it was possible that the law of
1883, requiring the Governor to advertise
propose! constitutional amendments in ac
least four newspapers of general circnla
tion, had been superseded by a later law re
quiring county clerks to mail to each voter
in the county a copy of all proposed
amendments. This, he was inclined to
think, was sufficient publication, and he
suggested that this matter be included in
the mandamus proceedings.
ALIBI FOR CALLENDINE.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 26.â That

band was in her company all of Christmas

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., May 26.â A resolu
tion was adopted by the carnival trustees

SEATTLE BANK FA I LURE.
The Guaranty Loan and Trust Company's
Institution Assigns for the Benefit
of Creditors.
SEATTLE, Wash., May 26.â The Guar
anty Loan and Trust Company's bank
closed yesterday, posting this notice upon
the door:
This Dank has been closed by order of its
board of trustees and an B>signnieiit has been
made for the benefit ol all iU creditors.
The concern has been generally known
to have been in a shaky condition for
eighteen months and its liabilities to de
positors are consequently small. How
ever, a contingent liability in the shape
of guaranty mortgage loans is reported
to be large.
In a published statement Jacob Furth,
the assignee of the Guaranty Loan and
Trust Company's bank, gives $162,000 as
the liability to depositors. The stock of
the bank is owned principally by Edward
Bailey of Harrisburg, Pa., und J. M. Sears
of Boston.

of their fields, carrying little coin outside
of a certain wise backing.
The attendance was rather limited. Es
pecially does this refer to the fair specula
tors, who usually throng the balconies;
cooler spots and iced punches evidently
proving a stronger attraction.
A bad tumble in the fifth event, a six
furlong sprinting affair, undoubtedly de
prived the backers of the favorite, Com
mission, tbe pleasure of gettiner in line.
White & Clarke's lumbering gelding was
considered a "moral" by the stable, and
his odds were hammered down from 3 to 2
to 4 to 5. While striding to the front down
the backstretch he jumped on Joe Cotton,
stumbled and threw Lloyd heavily to the
ground. Nell Flaherty, a 10 to 1 choice,
who was out in tbe lead, then won, with
little to spare, by a couDle of lengths in
1:15. Nervoso in a drive took the place
from Rebellion.
The Garden City stable's Warrago, with
but 99 pounds in the saddle, looked a cer
tainty for the rirst race of the day, a six
furlong run, and 4 to 5 looked a long price
against her. Taking tbe lead from Mon
arch at the far turn she opened up several
I lengths of daylight and won as she pleased,
| with the second choice, bweet Briar, taking
| the place from Linville.
Viking got another flying start in the
two-year-old half-mile scramble, and after
being backed down from 4 to 1 to 11 to 5
led untii a furlong from the wire, when
the 6to 5 choice Dolore drew ahead and
won by a neck in 49 seconds flat. Emelia
finished in the show.
The favorites kept up their winning clip
in the third race, a five ana a half furlong
selling sprint. Road Warmer, backed from
twos to 8 to 5, outsprinted Red Bird before
a third of the distance had been covered
and eased up at the finish passed the
stand a couple of lengths in advance of
Free Will, the second choice. Red Bird
wa9 a close third.
The Cambridge stable's Red Glen was
the first to stop the conauering march of
the favorites. So liberally backed was he
that his opening odds of even money gave
way to 7to 10 nearing post time. He was
never able to get to the front and finished
outside of the money. In a close and ex
citing drive Instigator, ridden by Ike
Johnson, got to the wire a scant head
before the second c oice. Belle Boy 1. The
winner was 5 to 1 throughout the betting.
Circe, the daughter of imp. Friar Tuck,
fast as a ghost, with an equally pro
nounced tendency to "back up," was
backed down from 8 to 5 to evens to v>in
the concluding race of the day over live
and a half furiones, and after leading into
the stretch began fading away, finishing
fourth. Coming on from third position,
old Oregon Eclipse, backed down from 7 to
5, passed the finishing-post a length ahead
of Mt. Roy, another 5 to 1 chaiice in the
betting.

The Finance Committee of the Board of
Education held a long and important ses
sion last evening to decide on the amount
of money to be aslieil from the Board of
Supervisors for tbe maintenance of tbe
School Department for the coming fiscal
year.
It was decided thnt nothing short of
radical changes would satisfy the growing
demands of the department, and that in
order to properly curry on the work of tLe
schools nearly twice as much money
would be necessary as was appropriated
for iÃfÂ»:>-;*;.
Last year $1,250,000 was asked, but the
Board of Supervisors cut the estimates to
$1,036,000. with which the department was
compelled to be satisfied, in addition to
the rents of the Lincoln School properly,
which aggregate about $38,000 a year.
This year the board will ask for $250,000,
with which to build a new High School
for' the Mission. Of this sum $75,000 is
estimate 1 fora building site.
The Supervisors will also be asked
for $52,000 for . the . rebuilding of
the Marshall -Grammar School, which
is said to be in bad condition.
Then there are a number of schools
where the sanitarye arranirments are in
very bad condition and $100,000 will be
asked for repairs in this and other lines.
Another municipal department has put
in its estimate for expenses for the coming

11.000,000 more than he received last year.
He bases his calculation that a big in
crease in the Street Department funds is

SCHOONERS COLLIDE.
The Lillie and the Ocean Spray Sud
denly Come to Grief Off
the Heads.
A collision occurred between two schoon
ers yesterday off Bakers Beach which re
sulted in a loss of several hundred dollars
to each of the vessels, but luckily nobody
was injured or killed.
The cause of the collision may be at
tributed to an excess of confidence, amount
ing almost to carelessness, upon the part of
the skippers.
The schooners were bound out, and
whe 1 they neared each other were beating
under light wind-. In attempting to pass
it was discovered too late that they could
not clear themselves.
The Ocean Spray 3truck the stern of the
Lillie. and then their masters decided that
it would be prudent for them to return to
port.
The Lillie. which had just come off the
Merchants' dry dock, had her new foresail
badly torn and her aft rail considerably
damaged.
The headgear of the Ocean Spray was
carried clean away.

Professor Munyon is honored to-day as
the leading authority in the medical world.
His new and humane methods of treatment
have swept away, all the old-fashioned
ideas of doctoring with poisonous drugs
that create a dozen diseases in the effort to
get rid of one. . He does not claim that he
has one remedy i that' will cure all com-
plaints, but that he has prepared a specific
cure for neariy every disease. He does not
claim that Munyon's Rheumatism Cure
will cure consumption, dyspepsia or any
other complaint, but he does assert that it
will cure rheumatism. Munyon's Dyspep-
sia Cure is prepared expressly to cure dys-
pepsia; Munyon's Cough Cure to cure
coughs; Munyon's Catarrh Remedies to
cure catarrh; Munyon's Kidney Cure to
cure kidney troubles. The same may be
said of all Munyon's different remedies.
They may be obtained at all drugstores,
mostly at 25 cents a bottle. . .

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Occasionally our climate is tropical.
These are the days that prepare us for
St. JioaiÃ.
Get yourself enrolled in a Republican
club and be a good citizen.
It seems to be no trouble at all for the
prairie States to catch their wind.
Will she guess it? Yes, she will guess
itâ and find there is nothing in it.
Fortunately we will not have the trans
fer nuisance to sweat over much longer.
After this the Czar feels very nearly as
big as Grover Cleveland thinks himself.
People going East this season should
take along some kind of anti-cyclone pill.
If this weather continues the next step
in dress reform will be a shirt waist for
men.
Where The Call leads our contempo
raries follow, but they do not always keep
step.
Don't forget that Decoration day was set
apart for patriotic observances and not for
casual frolics.
We now begin to understand the value
of those ocean winds that we complain of
on ordinary days.
So long as the hot spell lasts we will be
in touch with the Easterners and under
stand their feelings.
In this campaign the Republican party
will be the only unit in the count; all the
rest will be fractions.
At last the sugar bonnties are to be paid
by decision of the Supreme Court and Mr.
Bowler will be a bowler.
The man on top of a Democratic faction
is in about the same position as a man on
top of a barbed-wire fence.
If there is a spot on tae globe where the
British lion can lie down ana take a rest
he would like to know where it is.
There are as many thorns as jewels in
the Russian crown, and while the people
cannot see them the Czar feels them.
If this should turn out to be an earth
quake breeder let us hope it will give the
weather bureau the needed shake-up.
We thought Tillman was haymaking,
but we learn from his badge that he is
using his pitchfork to impale goldbugs.
There is a silver wing to the Democratic
party and there is a gold wing, as we all
know, but where is the bead of the bird?
A journalistic kite that cannot fly with
out a lot of fakes tied to its tail is evi
dently very badly balanced in its make-up.
Republican politics this year appeals to
the homes and firesides of the people, and
the heait of every workingman will re
spond to it.
An extra session of Congress after both
National conventions are held would fill
the political pot so full that no one could
put the lid on.
If all the plots reported to be on foot in
the Transvaal are true, the history of that
country for the next ten years will read
like a dime novel.
If the proposed carnival of the Golden
Gate is to be a success, the committee in
charge must be made broad enough to give
all the people a show.
When young Napoleon went to South
Africa to die he did not know that he was
putting the Napoleonic luster on the future
battlefields of Europe.
If a little country like Mexico can make
a good profit out of the free coinage of sil
ver, why could not a big Nation like ours
handle it with success?
We wish reciprocity with the free silver
countries to the south of us, and therefore
ought to have free silver ourselves in order
to trade with them on eqtial terms.
The workinemen of every branch of
American industry should organize tnem
selves into Republican clubs. This is go
ing to be a campaign for their benefit.
The Czar of Russia may not be strong
enough to keep the peace, but if a war ever
breaks up Western Europe he will be strong
enough to keep a good many of the pieces.
It seems agreed on both sides that the
Democratic convention will split. Each
wing will go off to itself and the body of
the party will be left in a hole in the
ground.
Local Democratic botses bad better ar
range a check system for those who wish
to transfer from one faction to another, so
that irresponsible fellows may be pre
vented from riding with both factions on
one fare.
The voices of the Republican press are
unanimous in approving the selection of
the State Executive Committee of the
party. There was one squeal at first, but
the voice of the squealer has been
squelched.
ON A SILVER BASIS.
The British Minister to Mexico, Sir
Henry Bering, who ia visiting San Fran
cisco, explains in a few words how it is
that the republic of Mexico is prosperous.
Silver is the money ot the country. All
the business is transacted with silver dol
lars, and when any other nation wants
Mexican products golu is received for
them. This brings plenty of gold into the
country to pay interest on bonds and other
obligations where gold is specified. By
this method the currency of the people is
stable and uniform, and in volume it is
fully eqnal to all demands. Of course
Wall street would declare that kind of
financiering idiotic to the last extreme,
but since the proof of the pudding is lound
in chewing the pudding itself, and since,
too, Mexico is prosperous, every line
of industry, commerce, mining and agri
culture being in a healthy condition and
steadily expanding, it would seem that
Wall street and all the rest of the United
States could not do better than absorb
some of Mexico's knowledge of the science
of finance.
Minister Bering gives it as his opinion
that Mexico will continue to be prosper
ous co long as she holds on to her present
monetary system, and he adds to the full
extent that diplomatic etiquette allows
that just such a Bysiem is needed in the
United States to broaden and deepen our
avenues of commercial operation. But Sir
Henry no more than voices the belief of the
great producing class of this as well as of
his own mother country. It is an unde
niable fact that practically all people of
England, Germany and the United States
who are not speculators in money fluctu
ations;, money-lenders or bond brokers, and
their political strikers, are decidedly for
the most liberal coinage possible of silver,
and when snch a statesman as Sir Henry
Dering not only indorses the monetary
system of Mexico, but points to the pros
perous and strongly entrenched position
of the various lines of business in that
country to bear him witness of the truth
of what he is saying, it would seem that
there is very much more evidence Sf lu
nacy in Wall street than among those who
develop the country's resources.
Perhaps the most absurd and illogical
argument of the goldites is, that if you
melt a $10 gold piece its commodity value
is ?till $10, and that ten silver dollars
melted are worth about $â¢> as commodity.
Of course, that is so. Would any one be
fool enough to sell his 258 grains of
standard gold for les3 than $10, when he
could carry it to the mint and have it
coined into $10 without expense? Is that
not why standard gold bullion i 3 of equal
value with the same quantity coined?
Would 412^ grains of standard silver have
a commercial value of only 50 cents, if its
owner had the privilege of taking it to a
mint and having it coined without expense
to himself into $1? Does not the coin
value of silver and gold fix their com
modity value? A Mexican silver dollar
may be melteo., but it retains its value of
$i because its owner can take it to the
mint and have it coined into $1 free ot
charge. Therefore, what is it that makes
metallic money "honest money"? Why,
simply giving it the privileges of the mint.
Nothing more nor less. As we have said,
the reason why 238 grains of standard gold
is worth $10 is because the Government
will stamp "Ten Dollars" upon it and
make it a legal tender for that number of
dollars. Now. all that the advocates of
bimetallism ask is that the same privilege
be given to 412VÂ£ grains of standard silver
that is given to 25 8-10 grains of standard
gold. Then the whole problem oi bimetal
lic money will have been solved.
THE PURPOSE OF TRUSTS.
Industrial trusts and railway combines
are condemned by all eood people, as they
should be, and in this connection it is well
to remark that one of the conspicuous fea
tures of Cleveland's administration is his
disinclination to disturb the trusts in their
raids upon the pocketbooks of the people.
It is said by some, that it is impossible to
prevent the formation of pools, combines
and trusts, but to admit that is to admit a
weakness in our system of government
which was not supposed to pxist. The in
centive which brings individual corpora
tions together in singleness of desire is
greed, aud the ultimate purpose is to
cheapen production and increase prices so
as to secure a wider margin of profit. A
trust is a combination of kindred interests
to so control the process and output of
production that all agencies will be obliged
to contribute muck of what should be
their share for the part they play.
But there are trusts and combines other
than those which control manufacture and
transportation, and it may be said that
they are far more injurious to the health
of the body politic than indus
trial and railway combines. "We re
fer to political combines between
party bosses for the control of public
offices, municipal improvement contracts
and the expenditure of the public's- money.
Combines of this kind seek to secure a
mortgage on the electoral freedom of the
people by secret combines which put a
price upon political preferment. Every
city has more or less of these combines.
The members of them nave no other nor
do they want any other means of support.
The industrial trust assesses all who
labor for it and all who consume its prod
uct. The political trust assesses candi
dates all the way from before the primary
up to and through the convention and on
to the closing of the polls on election day.
Failure to pay the assessments means
failure of the trust to deliver the votes
agreed upon. But it is the taxpayers who
finally foot the bills. The Democratic
party crested the political trust in 1852,
when Franklin Pierce was candidate for
President, and if other party bosses have
since employed the same kind of methods
it was taught to them by Democrats who
had deserted their own party. But, any
way, the political trust has come to be a
power and a dangerous influence in the
life of the Nation, and to the utter destruc
tion of which combine every good citizen
sh ould feel it his duty to lend a hand.
THE SUGAR BOUNTY.
The decision of the Supreme Court in
the sugar-bounty cases affirms the validity
of the law and obliges Comptroller Bowler
to obey it. The amount due sugar-pro
ducers is, in round numbers, $0,100,000,
and the amount of the appropriation $5,
-250,000, but most likely Congress will not
hesitate to provide for the deficiency if it
can be shown that* all the claims are valid.
There should never have been any hesi
tation on the part of the Government to
settle these bills, and, in fact, had Comp
troller Bowler not overestimated the au
thority that his office confers upon him
there would have been no cause for litiga
tion. The Wilson-Gorman bill did not in
tend to abrogate contracts made under the
law it repealed, but the Comptroller
thought otherwise, and refused to sign
vouchers for the payment of the bounty
earned before the new act took effect.
Oiie-of the peculiarities of the law creat
ing the office of Comptroller makes his
rulings superior to the Secretary of the
Treasury or the President. When Presi
dent Harrison was asked to order his
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 37, 1896.
Comptroller to approve certain claims,
which the treasury had allowed and the
Auditor had made a record of, he surprised
his petitioners by telling them that he had
no authority to oblige the Comptroller to
approve or disapprove anything. Mr. Har
rison then said tlia; under the law it was
the business of the Comptroller to verify
all bills payable; that no one bad authority
to overrule his conclusions as to the cor
rectness of his objections to paying given
claims, and that the only way himself or
the Secretary of the Treasury could pro
tect an honest claimant was to remove the
Comptroller for cause when he refused to
do what bu superiors thought he should
do.
But Mr. Bowler did not set up the plea
that the sugar-bounty bills had not been
properly rendered and vouchered. He as
sumed the right to pass upon the consti
tutionality of the law, and because he
made up his mind that the law was in op
position to the constitution he refused to
let a single one of the sugar-bounty claims
pass through his office. It was because he
turned himself into a court of law rather
than because he exercised the authority of
his office that he was cited before the
Supreme Court. The only thing now left
him to do to hinder payment of the bounty
is to discover clerical mistakes in the
figures of the auditor's or the treasury's
bookkeeper, but he is not likely to at
tempt anything of that sort, and the sugar
producers may reiy upon receiving the
sums due them.
FOR TERRITORIAL CONQUEST
Between denunciation of England by
the press and the Colonial Society of Ger
many and England's determination to not
only hold on to her possessions in South
Africa but to acquire more, an armed con
flict between the two nations may result.
It would be a mistake to suppose that
either Germany or Great Britain is actu
ated by a desire to better the material in
terests of the people of Southwestern
Africa. Both are aiming at territorial
acquisitions and the extension of their
political power. That the German Colo
nial party is squarely backed by the Gov
ernment and all factions no one doubts.
The Reichstag did not hesitate to grant the
Government a credit of 2,000,000 marks to
equip and maintain additional troops for
the German military forces now in South
Africa. The bill granting the credit men
tioned that it was for the puruose of hav
ing an ample force to suppress any upris
ing of the natives, but it was, in fact, to be
better prepared for any emergency that
might arise in Germany's effort to get
ahead of England in the race for more ter
ritory.
The feeling of the Germans is distinctly
shown in their criticism of President Kru
ger showing so much magnanimity toward
the men who were captured in the invasion
by the Johannesburg so-called'army of re
form. On the other hand, the British Colo
nial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, is ag
gressively vehement in his denunciation of
Kruger's Government for its vindictive
treatment of the invaders. It is hard to
see how Germany and England can help
resorting to arms otherwise than by agree
ing upon a division of the South Africa
country, but that would be diflicult, for the
question of who should have the lion's
Â»hare would be a knotty one.
It will be observed that the people of
South Africa are not to be consulted, but
overrun and thrashed into obedience.
President Kruger knew very well" what
Germany meant by offering to sustain the
neutrality of the Transvaal Republic. He
knew it meant a manufactured opportu
nity to send German troops that, when
once there in force, will never vacate.
Great Britain has quit playing diplomacy
in the affair, and proclaims what she
wants and what she will haveâ because it
is her due. The affair is now quite mixed
up as between England and Germany, but
it is the people and their native and nat
ural rights that are between the nether
and upper millstones of these territory
seeking nations.
FOR WORK AND WAGES.
The coming campaign is to be a contest
for American industry against foreign
competition. The Republican party will
seek a return to power in order that it may
re-enact the protective system that is es
sential to our prosperity.
In its last analysis, therefore, it will be a
business rather than a political canvass.
It will be carried on for the benefit of in
dustry and trade; it will mean work and
wages, and its issues will affect the home
ana the fireside, as well as the Nation.
The objects for which the canvass is to
be conducted by the Republicans renders
it in a special sense a workingmen's cam
paign. This fact should be emphasized at
every stage of the contest. Every branch
of industry that has been injured and de
pressed by the Democratic tariff ought to
organise a Republican club to take part in
the canvass.
Such clubs of workingmen parading in
torchlight processions would have a
marked effect upon the popular mind, and
would do much to remind the country
how widespread have been the disasters
caused by Clevelandism.
It is not too much to say that every
great industry of California from wool to
fruit has suffered from the Democratic
tariff. In this State a workingman's cam
paign would be virtually a clean sweep for
the Republican party. That, therefore, is
the campaign that shouid be organized.
Men who wish work and wages should get
into line for patriotism, protection and
prosperity.
THE WEEKLY CALL.
The sixteen pages of The Weekly Call
are filled with news from home and
abroad, though California news is always
given the preference. It is also a com
pendium of all that is new in the realms
of art, science and literature, and always
contains special articles from topics of the
day. In order that readers may be en
abled to view questions from different
points, letters from toe people, without
regard or creed or political affiliations, are
admitted, treating of prevailing customs
ana conditions. The Weekly Call, as
well as the Daily, speaus for all. It ap
pears to-day and will be found interesting
to all who wish a summary of the week's
news.
AND TEXAS, TOO.
Texas is driving ahead in the direction
of protection at a rate that will pat her
squarely in the Republican column of 1900.
An immense quantity of iron is to be had
in Eastern Texas, and coal and limestone
in plenty. There is no reason why there
should not be furnaces, foundries, iron
mills, nailmills and every other kind of
mills that work iron up into mer
chantable products established where
the iron ore deposits are, and all
these^ things suggest to the enterprising
Fort Worth Gazette the importance of es
tablishing broom factories, canning fac
tories, knitting mills and every other
known industry, as Texas can supply the
raw material for all the needs of man.
But how can all this be accomplished with
profit unless the Galveston and all other
harbors in and out of Texas are guarded
against the competing product of the
pauper labor of Europe?
Texas is not quite ready to go over to
thÂ« protection party, but her business
men are free to admit that the vast re
sources of the State cannot be developed
in the face of a competition that would
make their development a money-losing
process. But now that the belief is enter
tained pretty generally that Texas could
be made one of the leading manufactur
ing States, it is reasonable to suppose
that public opi nion will drift in the direc
tion of an appreciation of the need of pro
tection as the fonndation for all the fur
naces, foundries and mills the people are
longing for. It would be a curious thing
to see Texas return Republican electors,
but she certainly is considering the matter
very seriously.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Dr. Herbert Meister of Frankfort-on-the-
Main, who manufactures anti-pyrtne and anti
toxine for fever ana diphtheria in enormoua
quantities, is at the Palace.
Dr. Meister is accompanied by Dr. Robert
Pschorr, son of the world-famed brewer of
Munich, who died some two years a*o.
The gentlemen are traveling for pleasure.
They left Frankfort on March 24 last and have
since seen the big cities of the East. They
have also nad some experiences in the West
that were fraught with interest, for they were
at Cripple Creek at the time of the great fire
there.
The sights they saw In connection with the
hurried removal of women and children and
the transfer of goods were to them very strange.
Dr. Meister employs 3000 men in his great
anti-pyrtne and anti-toxine factory. It is at
Dr. Herbert Meister, the Millionaire Manufacturer of Antitoxine, Who Is Now
Here.
{Sketched from life by a " Call " arttit.]
Hoechst, on the Main, a suburb of Frankfort,
and nearly the whole population work for
him.
"The anti-pyrine is a cure for fever, as the
anti-toxine is a cure for diphtheria," said Dr.
Meister. "I am not myself a doctor of medi
cine, but a doctor of chemistry. However,
these remedies are cures, as has lately been
demonstrated. I count a great era in medical
science when these remedies were discovered.
"'So one can tell the good that will result
throughout the world. We also manufacture
dye-stuffs and other things, besides the anti
pyrine and anti-toxine.
"We have been much interested in viewing
the United State*. Since reaching California
we have visited Riverside, Los Angeles, Yo
semite and Monterey, and we will next see
Hawaii, China, Japan, India, Cape Town and
the Transvaal."
These gentlemen will sail to-morrow on the
Monowai.
Colonel John S. Mosby, the noted guerrilla
leader during the war, afterward Consul to
Hongkong under President Grant, has been
quite ill at the Hotel Imperial, on Sucter
street, for two weeks past.
Colonel Mosby, while on a visit to Washing
ton over a year ago, was stricken very ill with
the grip. He was confined to his bed for sev
eral weeks, and as will be remembered by the
dispatches was in a dangerous condition. He
recovered finally and returned here, looking
pale after his long siege.
This illness seems to have not been totally
eradicated, and was probably the cause of his
recent sickness here. He is considerably bet
ter now, however, and his friends hope that he
will soon be able to be out again and meet his
old friends, who have for somb time missed
him.
Colonel Mosby's famous lorays in the valleys
of the Rappahannock, Rapidan and in other
places in the Virginias made him for a long
time the most-talked-about man in the
country.
When Lee surrendered at Apponiatox and
word was sent to Mosby that the war was over,
and to come in and throw down bis arms, he
said he didn't care if Lee had surrendered, he
hadu't. He kept up his forays till the frolick
some deeds of Colonel Mosby began to impress
General Grant very seriously.
Finally, however, Mosby gave up fighting of
bis own accord and came into camp. He got
to be such a great friend of the "silent man on,
horseback" that Grant sent him as Minister to
China. This close friendship was maintained
to the time of Grant's death.
Dr. Tlrrell has been in attendance on Colonel
Mosby. It is stated that tm> colonel's present
ailment is appendicitis. He has been alter
nately better and worse for saveral days. Last
night the colonel sent out word that he was
getting along very slowly. There were -many
inquiries in regard to bis condition yesterday.
His son and two or three daughters have for
some years been living in Washington, D. C.
A few years ago his son was here, and re
mained with him for about a year and then
went to Washington.

of Fish.
RUSH FOR THE DELICACY
Contract for the New Fo<som-
Street Pier Let to James
McMahon.
WIDE RANGE OF THE BIDS.
Captains of Steamers From Abroad
Grumble at tbe Immigra'ion
Commissioner.
The first schooner from the balibnt
grounds got in Monday night, with 25,000
pounds of fish aboard. She is fitly named
the Pilot. Captain Jensen had not fairly
docked her at Fishermen's wharf yester
day before there was a rush of men, women
and children to purchase pieces of the de
licious fish.
The Pilot was fitted out on Puget
Sound, and when she passed out there
were thirty tons of ice in her hold. On t!:e
Cape Scott Banks, near Vancouver Island,
the men. went to work, and as fish were
plentiful they soon had the schooner full.
Fish weighing sixty pounds were com
mon, but the average was thirty pounds.
They were all caught with lines. One line
is called a "skidd," and it is 300 fathoms
long. Attached to it is what is called the
"sit" line, and on it are the hooks. These
latter are placed about two fathoms apart
and the "leaders" are about four feet long.
After being down a certain length of time
the "sit" line is hauled in and another is
run out along the "skidd" in its place. It
took the crew of the Pilot three days to
catch 25,000 pounds of fish. The schooner
mace the run to San Francisco in ten
days.

ready to supply the shipping July 1.

Owing to the Healy inquiry the revenue
cutters lay much longer at Main-street
wharf last season than usual. The usual
bill was sent in, but the Government re
fuses to pay more than half rates, and sent
a check on that basis. When the cutters
return from Bering Sea they will not be
given space at the wharves until some de
finite agreement has been reached.

HEARTLESSNESS
OF RAILROAD MEN
The Southern Pacific Con
fiscates a Woman's
Trunks.
HER NIGHT IN THE DEPOT
Full Fares Demanded for Chil
dren and Baggage
Detained.
THE RULES WON'T BE BROKEN
Other Roads Passed the Travelers,
but a Cinch Was Worked at
the Ferries.
A heartless case of persecution had its
finale on the water front yesterday. It
was' that of the Southern Pacific on one
side and a poor woman and three children
on the other. The corporatior won, and
tne woman, after sending her children on
to their destination, had to walk the
streets all night because she had not the
money to pay for a room.
Her sad case was called to the attention
of Superint^nder.? Whiting of tne San
Francisco and North Pacific Railroad
Company and he at once gave her trans
portation to Geyserville, where her hus
band and children are waiting for her.
In September last John Sheffield left
his home in Waterloo, lowa, to seek a new
location in California. He was tired of
the storms, cyclones and tornadoes of the
East, and after many a consultation with
his wife determined to try his fortunes in
the Golden West. He came here and
finally located at Geyserville. There he
built himself a home and when all wan in
readiness he sent for his wife and chil
dren.
Money was not very plentiful, but still
there was enonch to come on. The mother
sold most of her household effects and
Dacked what was left for the long journey
to California. The circumstances of the
ca^e were explained to the railroad agent
and he 1 the mother two full tickets
and one half-ticket to cover the through
fare of Mrs. Sheffield and her three chil
dren to San Francisco.
From Waterloo to Ogden these tickets
were accepted without demur by the rail
way conductors, and the little family felt
happy, thinking that erery mile brought
them" nearer their new hotiie. A few miles
otlt of Ogden the Southern Pacific con
ductor made his rounds and at once de
manded another half-fare from Ogden to
San Francisco. Mrs. Sheffield explained
the circumstances of the case, and said she
hnd not the money wherewith to meet the
demand. The conductor decided not to
put hor off the train, but took the number
ol her baggage checks.
Nothing more was Â»aid about the matter
and last Monday Mrs. Sheffield and her
three children landed in San Francisco
and wore all eagerness to eet their bag
gaee and leave on the Ban Francisco and
North Pacific Railroad for GeyserrillÃ.
The checks were banded to a transfer
man, but an hour later he returned and
said there was a charge of $12 50 against
tit* articles. On seeking an explanation
Mrs. Sheffield was told that the charge
was an extra half fare for one of her chil
dren.
The unfortunate woman was in a auan
dary.and acting onjtbe advice of the trans
fer man she went to the office of General
Passenger Agent Goodman.
The gentleman was not in, but Mr. Don
aldson listened to her story and curtly told
her that business was business, and that
the $12 50 would have to be forthcoming
before the baggage was delivered. Heart
broken, she returned to the ferries, and
purchasing tickets for the children at half
rates, she sent them on to Gevserville to
join their father. She then made several
more attempts to secure her belongings,
but they ali failed, and she had to maite
the best of the'long night that followed.
Yesterday, on the advice of the transfer
man, she explained her case to Ticket
Agent Megrain at the Tiburon ferry, .tie
sent htT to the m:iin office, and there she
at once secured transoortation. Her bag
gage is still in the hands of the Southern
Pacific, and the chances are that a suit for
damages will be the result of its illegal de
tention. ___^____^___
STILL NO BLANTHER.
No ' Definite Information Received by
the Police Yesterday About the
v Murderer. .
News of the capture of the murderer
Blanther is anxiously looked for at police
headquarters. ." . '
Captain Lees said last; nieht that he had
no new information to impart. 1 All yester
day bundles of circulars were mailed con
taining a description and photos of the
murderer and a notification of the reward
offered by the Governor.
His' capture occur at any moment,
as he is too conspicuous ' a rigure to escape
observation. His money,- cannot possibly
last much longer, and i hen he will be in a
trap unless he has succeeded, in > leaving
the country by steamer. "â 
It was reported yesterday that Blnnther
had left the Texas Pacific train at Sierra
Blanca, a station about ninety-five miles
from El j Paso, and -; that all ; trace ", of l him
had .' been lost. :At that : point it would
have been , possible for him to again take
the Southern Pacific for the South and
East and make his way to some seaport
town.

rinos. on i he northwest corner of Mer
chant and Sanpome streets, not more than
half a block "from the Postoffice and Ap
praiser's building.
It 13 certain that the burglary was com
mitted between the hours of 9:45 and 10:15
o'clock last nieht. About a quarter to 10
George F. Nichols, a special officer and
watchman employed by Mr. Camarinos
and other business men in the neighbor
hood, passed along Merchant street and
tried the door of the saloon. Everything
was all right then. Half an hour later he
again passed the saloon, and was about to
try the Merchant-street door.
His hand came in contact with a mass
of splinters, where tne door had been
broken. Suspeciing that the saloon bad
been robbed, the officer, with pistol in one
hand and a match in the other, entered
tbe building. Overturned beer and whisky
bottles, lying promiscuously upon the
bar, confirmed his suspicions. An open
door led into a small cardroom on the
Sansome-street eide of the saloon, and to
ward this the officer advanced with pistol
still in band.
Here again evidence of a recent whisky
and beer celebration, which must neces
sarily have been very brief, was to be seen.
The "burglars, however, had fled.
After going through the cash register,
which was left, unlocked and had been
opened by merely pressing one of the
keys, and" extracting from it the sum of
%'i or $4, the visitors had proceeded tore
gale themselves wfth refreshments.
They took away with them five bottles
of whisky, after having emptied the con
tents of a sixth and six or eight boxes of
cigars. The burglars also took away a
nickel-in-the-slot machine.
Strange to say nobody in the neighbor
hood heard any noise. G. Sancho, who
was working in the American Fish Union
Market, a few doors further up on Mer
chant street, at the time the robbery was
effected, heard nothing, unusual.

FEDERAL COURTS MIXED.
Peculiar Wording of an Act Just Panned
by Congress.
President Cleveland has signed the bill
changing the terms of the United States
District and Circuit courts of the Northern
District of California.
There is nothing startling or strange
in this act if considered solely on
its face, but just the same the new law
may bring about complications which
will finally result in dropping all criminal
prosecution in some half-dozen of the
most famous cases ever put on a court
calendar.
Prior to August. 1886, the Federal courts
were known as the Circuit and District
courts of the District of California, but at
the time named Congress passed an act
dividing t' c Srat* "into two districts,
known as the Northern and Southern.
The civil cases were transferred to their
â¢respective districts, but the criminal court
calendar was continued, that, is in some
cases.
This revival of a defnnct court was due
to the then District Attorney, who con
tended that criminal cases should be tried
in tbe old court. Justice Field rendered
an opinion affirming the position of the
District Attorney so far as it lelated to
cases before that body. A Grand Jury
was summoned and indictments returned
against Benson. Perrein and others, now
famous in the great land litigation.
While no new business has been placed
on the calendar these cases have been c n
tinued from term to term and now await
tbe action of the authorities at Washing
ton. The bill just signed by President
Cleveland makes no provisions for the sit
ing of this old court of the District of Cali
ornia. It is a question therefore as to the
egal existence of this body. If it has
none, then the Benson case from a.crim
inal standpoint la settled.
In any event it will be necessary for
Judge McKenna to call special sessions, as
tbe new law is radically different from the
old.
Judge Morrow said yesterday that the
law continuing in existence the District
Court of California is found in section 4 of
the act of August 5, 1886, under which the
Benson cases are being prosecuted. That
section, he claims, has not been changed
or in any way modified or disturbed.
Judge Morrow contends that the new act
amends section 3of the old act and noth
ing else.
Under the old law the United States
courts met the first Monday in February,
second Monday in July and fourth Mon
day in November. The first two terms
were of five months each and the last only
two months. This was not an equal divi
sion of jury service, bnt before tne Court
of Appeals was established it was the best
that could be devised.
For some months now, however, this un
equal system has been manifestly ap
parent and an effort was accordingly made
to change it. The law as it now stands
makes tbe beginning of terms as the first,
second and first Mondays in March, July
and November.
Judge Morrow adjourned court yester
day at the conclusion of the Zimmerman
case, but it is his purpose to order a spe
cial session, which will continue until the
time arrives to open the regular session
under the new bill. Tbe Grand Jury was
dismissed yesterday and it is* not
likely that another will be called before
the July term.

Cloakmakers Organize.
The cloak preasers and operatives of this
City have formed a union which to some ex
tont will operate with the United Garment
Workers of America. At the organization
meeting J. Goodman presided. Speakers from
the Labor Council and from the Garment
Workers' Union urged the cloakmakers to
organize for the elevation of their condition
and the general trade. A permanent organiza
tion will be effected at the next meeting.
Civil Service Rule*.
The several local Federal departments re
ceived formal notice yesterday of the new
Civil Service law as already published in The
Call. With the exception of the Postmaster,
assistant postmaster and cashier and common
laborers every man in the employ of the Gov
ernment is subject to Civil Service ruie. This
effects the Mint also, making about 500 addi
tions to the new law.

NEW BLOOD OF THE
PACIFIC-UNION,
First Election Under the
Modern Constitution of
the Club.
HOPKINS IS PRESIDENT.
Opposition Ticket Headed by
Thomas C. Van Ness Was
Withdrawn.
KAILROAD CROWD IGNORED.
President-Elect Hopkins Once the
Leader of a Band to Organize
a New Club.
Tbe first election in the Pacific-Union
Club under the new constitution recently
adopted took r>lsc<Â» yesterday and resulted
in a partial victory for the modern or pro
gressive element of the institution. The
officers elected are:
Presidentâ E. \Y. Hopkins.
Vice-presidentâ Russell J. Wilson.
Secretaryâ James D. Phelan.
Directors â Thomas Brown, George A. New
hall, H. H. Veuve, A. Chesebrough and Wil
liam Babcock.
Several days ago an opposition ticket,
headed by Thomas C. Van Ness for presi
dent, was in the field, Jaut last Saturday it
was withdrawn, hence the regular ticket
was chosen without dissent.
Members of the club point to the names
on the regular ticket as a sufficient guar
antee that new vieor and activity will be
given to the management of club affairs.
In one sense Thomas C. Van Ness was
regarded as a better representative of the
modern go-ahead spirit of the club than
Mr. Hopkins, the president-elect, but the
latter is rated as a modern. Some years
ago he ficured as a leader in a band of
fifty members that threatened to start a
new club aud pledged themselves each to
put up $1000 to launch the new enterprise.
It is claimed for him that if he was then
sufficiently enterprising to break away
from old-fashioned methods he is still
alive to tbe spirit of club progress, and
that his administration of affairs will be
progressive.
The phrase "railroad crowd" has often
been used in Pacific-Union circles to des
ignate some of the leading men of the
Southern Pacific Company.. The comment
was quite frequent for a time that the
club was run to promote their convenience
and exalt tbe railway magnates above the
station of common everyday members.
Indeed, the old system of fifteen directors
divided into three classes was opposed Dy
many, who hoped by abolishing it to legis
late the "railroad crowd" out of club con
trol.
Tbe railroad influence is certainly not
paramount in the board elected yesterday.
It is true that Russell J. Wilson is Mrs.
Stanford's attorney, but his "pull" with
the company is said to be about ex
hausted when he gets his own annual
pass renewed.
As clubmen go James D. Phelan should
be classed as modern. Should the Pacific
Union contemplate the erection of a new
clubhouse Mr. Pbelan could show them
tbe magnificent edifice at tbe corner of
Mason and Sutter streets as a specimen of
modern architecture in relation to club de
velopment.
George A. Newball and H. H. Veuve are
progressive. Thomas Brown is conserva
tive, and Messrs. Chesebrough and Bab
cock are ceitainly active and public-SDir
ited citizens.
AGAINST CONVICT GOODS,
The Local Trades Unions Take
Up the Fight for Free
Labor.
The Ironmolders and Sandstone-Cut
ters Communicate With Con
gressmen.
The trades unions have practically joined
bands with the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association in their efforts to
drive convict-made goods out of the mar- \
ket, and particularly those goods shipped
into the State from Eastern prisons. .
Ironmolders' Union No. 164 took up the
subject recently aha last night the follow
ing resolution presented by a special com
mittee was adopted :
' To the Officers and Member of Ironmolders'
Union No. JGUâ Brothees:. Your committee ap
pointed.to draft resolutions expressing the
sentiment* of this union relative to the prison
labor contract system, beg leave to report the
following for jour consideration and approval :
WuEistAs, The question ot prison convict
labor is receiving the attention of all persons
interested in free labor, and as our trade is
seriously affected by the importation of stoves
and hollow ware and other manufactured arti
cles, we believe it to be our duty to render all
the assistance in our power in favor of the bill
before Congress that prohibits the sale and
shipment of prison goods into a sister State.
With the assurance that we will do oar part to
stamp out the system within the border of
California; therefore be it
Resolved, That we do, as trade unionists, al
ways willing and ready to perform a fair day's
work for a fair day's pay, challenge the justice
ot being forced into competition with the !
criminal class. The prison contract-labor sys
tem is one of the worst evils of our Btate and
it is getting to be generally felt. The practical
result of convict labor is to pauperize honest
labor. The prosperity of the masses and the
- promotion of morals would be benefited if the
system was wiped out. Be it further -
Resolved; That we are in favor of the bill in
the National Legislature and the sense of this
union is, and we call upon our sister unions
throughout the country, whether brought into
competition or not, to use their influence by
requesting their Senators and Congressmen to
vote for its passage: and be it further
1U tolled. That the corresponding representa
tive forward a copy of these resolutions to the
president of the ironmolders' Union of North
America, requesting that he lay the matter be
fore the different local unions, requesting
their co-operation: and be it further â  â  â¢. .
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be
forwarded to our United States Senators and
Representatives in Congress, with the earnest
request, that both by voice and vote, they ren
der the assistance in their power to crush out
thin pernicious system. R. Burnett, A. Mc-
Dermott, A. Baker.
: The Sandstone-cutters' Union has also
taken up, the same subject and has re
cently been corresponding with the Pacific
Coast' representatives in Congress * urging
them to support the same bill. . Senators
Perkins ana White have replied to I these
letters and : promise to give the bill 1 their
careful consideration. The union ?is par
ticularly interested in the subject of , using
, convict-cut stone for public buildings and
this, too, will > be looked into by the Sen
ators named. ' This union further urged
tbe Senators to do all in their power to de
feat the Loud bill excluding trades union
journals and similar literature from the
list of second-class mail matter. Senator
Perkins does not think that this bill will
be reached by the present Congress.
WILL FIGHT DELAY.
Mission Property Owners Will Endeavor
to Force the Noe Suit to an
Early lasue.
Mission property-owners are becoming
exasperated at the long delay that threat
ens to ensue Difore the Noe litigation
comes to an issue. The present feeling of
doubt and uncertainty that hangs over the
land titles in the San Miguel Rancho
Tract has practically put a atop to build
ing and improving in that neighborhood.
The property-owners, confident of tbe
validity of their titles, are bitterly op
posed to delay, for as long as the present
uucertainty lasts, so long will ttiere be no
new buyers and no improvements on the
land in dispute. A prominent property
owner and old-time resident of the Mis
sion, when seen by a Call reporter yes
terday, said:
"This whole piece of business is the
work of certain schemers and manipulators
who wish to g^ive the Mission a black eye.
These Noe heirs have no more hope of ac
quiring an interest in the rancho than
tney have of living. The only parties who
are .making money directly out of the
scheme are the corporations which are in
suring the titles to the land affected. The
primary object of the suit is to put a stop
to improvement at the Mission and turn
home-seekers and builders toward the
Richmond district and other localities.
"Some of the Richmond people who are
at the bottom of this matter hope by tying
up Mission titles in tedious litigation to
stop progress in the Mission for four or
five years until tbe Richmond people can
'get out of the woods,' get their cemeteries
removed and their sandhills leveled.
"A long tedious lawsuit would accom
plish and is accomplishing such an end.
Building is dead In the Mission. One con
tractor that I know of who used to build
cottages to sell in Noe Valley has left ihat
neighborhood and is now putting up a
number of new nouses over near the Po
trero hills. People will not buy while
things remain as they are now. Intending
purchasers are easily frightened out of
'buying a lawsuit,' Something must be
done immediately to force the suit 10 an
issue or progress in the Mission, which is
naturally the most desirable residence
property on the peninsula, will be checked
during an indefinite period of litigation."
MONEY MADE IN CHIAPAS

Alonso Reosta, a wealthy merchant of
Alonso Reosta, the Wealthy Coffee-Grower of Tapachula Who Has Arrived Here.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
Tapachula, in the State of Cniapas, Mex
ico, below the peninsula of Lower Califor
nia som â¢ 500 miles, is at the Occidental,
accompanied by several friends.
Mr. Reosta is engaged both in merchan
dizing and coffee-growing. He is a native
of Mazatlan and only went to Chiapas
three years ago. Chiapas is one of
the small, but very productive states of
the southern republic. Mr. Reosta speaKa
very highly of it. He considers it a great
place for money making.
"I never saw so good a place for this as
Chiapas," said he, "and the money is
largely made in coffee. Tbe worst feature
of life there is the difri â  ulty of getting
good servants. The natives who are em
ployed in this way are very indolent and
inattentive.
"However, labor is not high there. For
the Indian help of the coffee plantations
we pay from 37 to 50 cents a day in silver.
We employ this Indian labor almost alto
gether.
"Chiapas will produce this year about
50,000 auintals of* coffee, 2000 of cocoa and
1000 of India rubber, besides very large
quantities of all Kinds of tropical fruits.
The rubber industry is comparatively new.
It is destined to be very important.
"There are a few Americans there, but
the foreign population is mostly German.
The goods consumed are to a large extent
brought from Europe and this country.
"The coffee business has been peculiarly
profitable for some years. There is money
made in selling goods, but it does not
equal the profits from growing coffee.
"If a man goes there with money he can
do well. Of course the more he can take
the more he can do whence gets there.
"The little State of Chiapas has 29,000
people, while the town that I do business
in, Tapachula, has only 1300. It is an
odd and very interesting country."
Mr. Reosta is a large man and likes life
in Chiapas very well. He came on the
Orizaba and will remain about three weeks.
Special Session Ordered.
â ;â  Judge McKenna signed an order yesterday
calling for a special session of the Circuit
Court to take up the unfinished business of

Morrow will Issue a similar order to-day, both

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 1896.
SCHOOL TEACHERS
REQUIRE MONEY
In Aid of Their Annuity
and Retirement
Fund.
DEDUCTION FOR ABSENCE
The Board of Education Will
Be Requested to Inter
vene.
A SMALL SUEPLUS ON HAND.
Measures Taken by the Teachers'
Society to Put the Fund on a
So id Basis.
Four hundred and fifty public school
teachers of Ban Francisco, with an eye to
the future, are taking measures to put
the annuity and retirement fund, of which
City Treasurer Widber is the custodian,
upon a more durable and profitable basis.
To this end the Board of Education will
be petitioned to intervene.
The balance in the fund on the Ist of
this month was $5475. The income, de
rived from the tax of 1 per cent a month
upon the salaries of the teachers desirous
of availing themselves of its benefits, aver
ages $375. Following is the list of retired
teachers and the sums drawn monthly
from the fund by them: Miss Cornelia R.
Campbell $50, Mrs. H. A. SU John $45,
Miss Victorine M. Raclet $45, Mrs. M. A.
Currier $50, Mrs. Mary J. Cline $50, Mrs.
Laura T. Hopkins $50, Misa L. E. Ryder
$50.
Each of these beneficiaries had by law
to pay into the fund the sum of $300 belore
they were entitled to draw from it, but
after March 1, 1898, this premium will be
no longer required, yet, some source of
revenue, aside from the salary tax, is
urgently needed to swell the fund and
place it upon a more solid and permanent
foundation.
Under existing conditions, with a few
thousand surplns, as stated, the monthly
receipts of $375 are only $45 in excels of
the $330 expended. If a* few more names
were to be put on the list it would not take
many years to exhaust the annuity fund.
The teachers are fully alive to the situa-
tion and sot wishing to be left in their old
age without a fund to fall back upon they
are stirring around to see what can be
done about it.
At a session last Friday night of the
Schoolteachers' Annuity and Retirement
â¢Society the situation was discussed in de
tail and resulted in tbe appointment of a
special committee, composed of Miss Agnes
M. Manning (chairman), Azro L. Mann,
Mrs. Aurelia Griffith, Miss Jessie Smith
and Miss Frances Hodgkinson, whose duty
it will be to confer with the Board of Edu
cation. Section 102 of the rules says:
No teacher shal 1 receive any compensation
when absent from duty. A deduction of one
twentieth of the monthly salary shall be made
for each day's absence and one-slxtn of a day's
salary for each hour's absence, exceot the ab
sence be in accordance with the section which
permits teachers to visit other schools.
The money thus deducted for absences
in consequence of sickness and retained by
the City averages $3000 a year, and the
Board of Education will be petitioned to
amend its rules and to direct that this sum
be paid into the annuity fund. The idea is
looked upon favorably by Director Thomas
R. Knox. chairman of the rules commit
tee, and unless there be an illegality at
tending it will in all probibility soon be
put into operation.
"The law creating our annuity and re
tirement fund," said A. L. Mann, the
president of the society, "is sadly defec
tive in several essentials and in need of
amendments. The annuities are too high
for the income, and it is imperative for us
to take immediate steps to increase our
revenue. Fully half of our teachers are so
dissatisfied with the provisions of the act
that they have declined to contribute the
1 per cent monthly tax, and then, too,
there was an unwarranted feeling amone
them that the Board of Education under
the law would have the power to retire
teachers at the expiration of the stated
time against their will and to place them
on the annuity list. I never held this
opinion, and it was finally upset by City
and County Attorney Creswell.
"What we are asking now of the Board
of Education is to turn into the annuity
fund the money deducted from the
teachers' salaries for absences. It is noth
ing more than what is done in New York.
There the teachers' annuity society also
gets the benefit of the dog tax, etc., and is
in a very satisfactory condition. With us,
yon see, when a teacher who is receiving a
salary of $80 a month is sick and absent
for a clay $4 is deducted. Ot this sum $2
goes to pay the substitute teacher, and we
merely desire that tbe difference of $2 be
placed to the credit of the annuity fund,
instead of being retained as at present by
the City.
"We shall introduce some amendments
at the next session of tbe Legislature em
powering the City Treasurer to invest our
surplus capital so that it can draw inter
est, and making the payment of the 1 per
cent salary tax compulsory upon all teach
ers who may in future enter the depart
ment. Buch is now the practice in the
States of Illinois and Ohio, and I can con
ceive of no good reason why it should not
be so in California. Then* with the fur
ther income which we may reasonably
lope to derive from tbe diversion to us of
some special license taxes, like that of the
dog license in New York, and the money
we may realize from donations, legacies
and entertainments, we shall be able soon
to put our annuity fund upon a solid and
permanent basis."
FOR MARS' MURDER.
Trial of the \ Accused Members of the
. Lathers' Union.
The trial of the eight members of the
Lathers' Union commenced < before Judge
Belcher yesterday. The defendants in the
case are John Holmes, William Starr,
Daniel Dunne, J. D. McÃea, Neal Collins,
William Dowling, E. G. Waltz and Walter
McCoy.
The charge against the men is murder
for the killing of C. A. Mars during the re
cent strike among some of the building
trudes. Mars was a non-union man, and a
number of the strikers went to where he
and his sons were working and tried to
persuade them to quit. A fight ensued,
and Mars received injuries which caused
his death.
His son, C. A. Mars, was the only wit
ness examined yesterday. He told the
story of the row, and he said that after his
father was bit he mentioned the names of
Dunne and Holmes as being two of the
crowd who struck him. The witness iden
tified all the defendants as being mem
bers of the crowd which assaulted his
father. : â  ' ' - '. â  " .

NEW INSPECTION LAW.
Dulls and Holler* of Bering Sea Vessels
to Be Inspected.
Supervising Inspector Bermingham of
the Hulls and Boiler Department is in re
ceipt of a communication from Washing
ton requesting nis opinion on what is
known as the Frye bill. This measure
was introduced la the Senate by Senator
Frye in February last, and after two read
ings was referred to the Committee on
Commeice.
The proposed bill inaugurates several
changes, the most important of which is
the inspection of vessels in Bering Bea by
duly delegated officers of the revenue cut
ter service;. It also authorizes mate and
master of coast sailing vessels to make in
spections, and licenses second and third
mates to perform similar duties under cer
tain conditions. All naphtha launches of
fifteen tons or over are added to the list of
vessels subject to inspection.
Supervising Inspector Bermingham gives
the bill vis unqualified indorsement, and
it will doubtless become a law before Con
gress adjourns.

the representations of Lathrop. He says he

only worth $30,000. He wants judgment ren
dered in his favor in the suit.

GOLDBUGS RULE?
A Cl#se and a Fierce
?ight at Sacra
mento.
IT'S ]TIP, TUCK AND WAR
The Local Contest Will Deter
mine the Greater Issue
That Is On.
A CONVENTION FORECAST.
Strong Is the Federal Machineâ Both
Financial Factions Confident of
Victory.
Will the California goldbugs control the
State Convention when it convenes in
Sacramento June 16?
The heavy-weights of the Federal Bri
gade and the gold men generally who are
taking an active interest in the financial
record the party is about to make all say
so..- Most of them say so with great confi
dence.
The silver Democrats are just as san
guine that silver will run the Sacramento
convention.
Which faction will rule is quite uncer
tain at the present writing, but there are
some things that are certain enough to j
give long odds on. One is that if the
Junta delegation from San Francisco is
seated it will be nip-and-tuck on the great
issue that is rending the party from the
Muskingum to the San Joaquin.
Another certainty is that it will be the
'fiercest Democratic convention that ever
entertained California and made political
history hereabouts. The probabilities of
its horrors appear really appalling. The
financial question may split it wide open
and there are the indorsement of Cleve
land, the indorsement of Jiudd, the big
contest from San Francisco involving con
trol of the ' local party and some other
things calculated to add gore to the field
of carnage.
Tae convention is three weeks off, r " out
100 of the 600 delegates have been el ted
throughout the State by sixteen coumies,
and the situation is just beginning to take
definite form and present tangible pros
pects.
. It appears likely th&t there is to be
another Michigan" convention out here.
The administration whip is being well
laid on and the Federal brigade is con
ducting a hard and persistent campaign,
with the assistance, active or passive, of
the large gold element in the Democratic
party in this State.
There is little question in any observant
minds that the party in its mass is by a
very great majority for silver. The silver j
men would easily ruie the convention if j
the 600 delegates came naturally and !
spontaneously from the people, represent- ]
ing the views of their constituents. But I
there is no active silver campaign being j
conducted by strong leaders of wide prac- i
tical influence. *n - *- - ? â -
' It is different 'on the other side. The
Federal machine has been long at work.
It is working faster every day. The Dag
gett-McNab-Gould combination is the
, overshadowing power in the gold ranks,
and Daggett is the big man of this com- j
bination as far as this issue goes, Chair
man Gould being under his control, and '
'his co-worker, McNab, being chiefly con
cerned with San Francisco politics. Ad
ministration forces and gold men who will
.co-operate are scattered all over the State,
and the Federal office-holders have no
v.here lost a trick that could be taken.
The strength of the gold faction in the
convention will hence be much greater
than it is in the party.'
Superintendent of the Mint Daggett will
dominate the gold forces at Sacramento.
. He is the especial representative of the ad
ministration here because he is the strong
est force. From the day he took his office
he has played his patronage power forper
sonal power. His style of doing politics
. is ruthless, but , strong. His work has
been aggressive and relentless, as has been
Ebown chiefly in the local tight. He has
quit at no rebuff; or defeats, but has
> cursed his enemies and tried again for all
lie could get. After all the shouting not
Jong ago that the Daggett-Ralney combi
nation in the Junta was beaten it has
quietly come to pass that Daggett and
McNab are absolute masters of the Junta
delegation that has practically been se
lected.
. Daggett's scattering strength through
cut the State is largo and at Sacramento
lie will be the chief manipulating power
of that wing of the party. He expects to
â¢ carry throueh the administration pro
gramme, gain control of the State Cen
tral Committee with the assistance of Mc-
Nab, Gould, Rainey and others and help
turn the local machine over to McNab
and Rainey. >
In figuring out the prospective compar
ative strength of the gold and silver con
vention forces the chief consideration is
at once the local contest. The Buckley
.regular general committee will send up
161 delegates, with every man personally
pledged in writing to silver. The Dagcett
.McNab . delegation will yield at least 150
votes for gold and it is likely that Dot a
half-dozen silver! tes will be found mixed
up in it. If the unit rule is adopted the
delegation will . yield a solid block of 161
votes for gold and all the rest of the pro
gramme.
The 161 votes from San Francisco are
likely to control the convention. If the
Junta in seated and the rival thrown out,
the gold faction will need but 150 votes
from all the rest of the State to have a ma
jority, as the delegates will number 600.
The goldbugs count on the Junta being
purely recognized, and hence their confi
dence.
To seat the Buckley delegation would
give the silver men an overwhelming con
tiol.' To divide the representation. would
undoubtedly give the silver faction a good
â¦ majority. The local contest is thus closely
bound up with the great convention issue,
and the Buckleyites are as certain of at
least seating half their delegation as of the
KEW TO-DAT.

coming of another day. As there will un
doubtedly be a local coming together in
Home shape after thÂ» convention, this is
looked upon as a natural disposition of the
case. The interior is not expected to look
with great favor qji the proposition of
turning the local party over to McNab,
Rainey and Daggett anyway.
Hut the Federal brigade will fight for
the Juntp as for life, and. indeed, ail things
being eqÂ».al, the Junta would have a
great advantage, as the anti-Buckley feel
ing is strong throughout the State. Many
strong influences will work in relation to
this contest, as they have long been work
ing. The State is being flooded with let
ters and wires are bein^ pulled in every
direction. The Buckleyites say little of
their work ana prospects, while the Junta
people make loud and constant claims
that every delegate or leader they see or
hear from is "against Buckley." But they j
will all say that in answer to a direct i
question. When they come to vote with
all things considered it may be a different i
thing.
So the anti-gold, anti-Cleveland, anti-
Dageett forces are counted on to largely i
make the right for the Buckley delegation
and for themselves.
It is likely that the supreme clash will
come with lightnings and with thunders
almost ai quickly as the convention comes
to order. Gould will place the Junta dele
gation on the temporary roll. Gould, j
backed by all the forces affiliated with him,
will attempt to let the Junta delegation
vote on temporary organization to elect a
friendly temporary chairman who will ap
point a friendly committee on credentials.
It is solemnly promised that Secretary
John Markley" will never speak the first
name in such a rollcall.
If this programme is attempted to be
enacted through the record of Democratic
Donnybrook fairs is likely to be broken.
Many Buckleyites say that if this scheme
should be persisted in the convention may
split wide open then and there, not so
much for the row their hosts will raise as
through the rebellion of other delegates
who will demand fair play. But how all
this will come out no man may say.
Some of the 150 votes from the reÃt of
the State needed by the gold bugs are ex
pected from the First Congressional Dis
trict. Ex-Congressman Geary of Sonoma
is a fierce administration man and a friend ,
of Daggett's. He is on his way back from j
Washington and will take off bis coat j
\V!)en he gets here. Prisoner Director J. ,
11. Wilkins i& a strong force in Marin !
County, and its few votes are claimed by
the cold men throiigh Wilkins. Elliott,
McAllister, ex-Sheriff Healy, now in the
Mint, and others. Five of the delegates
elected from Humboldt County are sup
posed to be friends of Daggett.
The sixteen counties that have chosen
delegates either through conventions or !
county committees are: San Diego,
Orange, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo,
Kings, Stanislaus, Merced. Kern, El
Dorado, Sutter, Colusa, Glenn, Siskiyou
and Humboldt.
There is no certain information as to
how these delegations stand. A large ma
jority of the ten from San Diego are
claimed for gold. John C. Fisher, Collec
tor of the Port at San Diego, and Attorney
Oscar A.Trippert are running the gold
forces there and are strong factors. Fisher
is a close friend to Senator "White.
The outcome of the primary election at
Los Angeles will cut an important figure.
The railroad is a big element in the hot
tiijht ou down there. The delegation will
probably be mixed. John T. Gaffey, Col
lector of the Port, leads the administration
forces, but the delegation will be largely
for silver. Majorities of the Merced and |
Stanislaus delegations are claimed by the
gold politicians who are Keening cases.
Daggett will have most of the Siskiyou del
egation.
The gold men expect strong reinforce
ments from Santa Clara, where Barney
Murphy and Senator Whitehurst of Gil
roy are among the workers for that end.
A majority of the county committee and
a majority of the delegation are claimed. '
In ban Joaquin County Gould and Sena
tor Langford are prominent laborers in
the yellow cause.
It is thus that the workers to save the
country from the "disaster" of a free-silver
victory forecast a victory at Sacramento.
The Junta delegation and 150 or so votes
besides would give it to them. Of course,
the election of delegates-at-large depends
on the factional control of the convention.
The Daggett programme now appears to
be Barney Murphy of San Jose, E. B.
Pond of San Francisco and Thomas J.
Geary of Sonoma. This will be a strong J
combination with which to effect a trade
with the south.
A gold victory of course means the turn
ing down of Congressman Maguire and
W. WÂ« Foote, along with Senator White
if he should decide to enter the squabble,
i The silver wing, would be apt to honor
those.
Alameda County is the field of a fierce
battle between Irish, Glasscock and Fitz
| gerald and the Englishes, Moffit and Lay-
I mance. The Irish wing is for gold and j
| Dapgctt is straining himself in their be- i
half. Frank Moffit is a leader of the silver
forces, which have the best of It just now,
and tue P^nglishes, though necessarily ad
ministration men and necessarily in the
Moffit- Laymance camp against their ene
mies, several gold delegates are apt to slip
into the delegation.
There is yet no talk on either side of
bolting if things do not ttirn out right at
Sacramento, but there is time for that.
The goid men are thought much more
likely than the silver men to take their
medicine if administered.
It is recognized that the plain tendency
of the Democratic party throughout the
country toward free silver will have its in- j
fluence on the State Convention.
There will be a hot convention fight on !
the indorsement of Cleveland's financial j
policy. His administration will be easily :
indorsed in all other respects.
How Governor Budd and his State ad
ministration forces will figure in the gen- j
eral mess nobody knows. Budd is for
silver but he iB doing no shooting about it
as yet. He is anxious for an indorsement
and anxious for tue future, but His politi
cal enemies in this convention will be
many and the bosses of the gold wing will
be chief among them.
"If Budd gets an indorsement he's got
to keep his nose clean," was the way an
active administration man gave warning
yesterday that Budd would better keep
j out of the money-Cleveland fight. Budd
will show his attitude more clearly later,
when the situation gets plainer.
The number of Democrats who wont
talk politics, local, State and even Na
tional, is remarkable. Some don't know
what to say about things, so badly are
they mixed, and others would rather keep
still for a while, anyway.
George W. Baker, the California repre
sentative of the Bimetallic League and the
head of the inchontic independent free
silver party in this State, is a Republican
otherwise, but he has probably kept closer
watch on the silver issue here than any
other man and his opinion about the
Democratic State Convention is or interest
and value.
"It is my opinion that the convention
I will declare for free silver," he said yes
! terday, "though theie is a hard fight
1 being made against it by the Federal
J brigade. I do not beliove that the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 1896.
men will control the convention
even if the 161 Junta delegates bossed i
by McNab, Daggett and that coterie
are sealed. They can't control the County.
There is no question that the rank and tile
of the party is for silver. The convention
will declare for bimetallism in some style,
if it does not come out flat-footedly for
free silver.
"I doubt that the Junta delegation will
be seated. The 'Buckley' cry is being
used as a bugbear largely. The local fight
is one of the 'outs' against the *ins,' and
the outs are in a large majority. I see
that the delegates at large named by the
Junta campaign committee last night
nearly all belong to the Cleveland Democ
racy.
"Daggett has made a host of enemies
and many in the Junta organization are
ufraid of McNab's securing control of the
machine. For these and other reasons I
do not think that ltil gold votes will be |
placed from San Francisco and that the
views of the party will be expressed. Ala
meda County, where I live, will send a
silver delegation, for I believe that the
John P. Irish crowd will be beaten.
"I believe that the golvl men will con
tiol the Chicago convention because they
have the machinery to make up the tem
porary roll and put in contesting sold del
egates. The best thing for the silver men
would be for the Democratic National Con
vention to nominate a cold manâprefera
bly Cleveland.
"Then the free-silver pa.ty would start
out and probably make an alliance with
the Populists. If the Democratic party
declares for free silver and nominates a
good free-silver man, we will do what we
o>a to indorse him. Ido not say that in
that event it would be impossible to bring
about a Populist nomination of the same
man, but it is improbable.'*
Max Popper, one of the champions of
gold, had this to Bay about financial
politics:
"It is too early to say how the State
Convention will be made up on this issue,
because so few counties have elected
delegates, but I believe that the
silver forces will be in a minority.
San Diego is largely for gold and
I was surprised to learn that Stanislaus
and Merced were not for silver. I think
that it will be a close and a hard tight.
However, if the other States keep on
pledging for silver, it will have its effect
on the convention, as many will
be inclined to follow the trend
ot the party and be in with
the winning side. As to Chicago I can
only hope there will be no bolt. I want to
see harmouy. The silver men are the only
ones talking about bolting so far."
"The State Convention will declare for
silver by a good majority, "said W.W.Foote.
"About thirty Slates have declared for sil
ver and that will appeal to the convention.
I am going to the State Convention chiefly
to introduce two resolutions, one declaring
against the A. P. A. and the other against
the funding bill. 1 don't think that there
will be a bolt at Chicago, though it is hard
to tell what will happen if the pawn
brokers run the convention."
Frank McCoppin, the Postmaster of Ban
Francisco, is very shy of interviewers, but
well posted Democrats sÂ»y that he will
carry the gold banner before the campaign
is over.
John P. Dunn, Registrar of the Land
Office, has not taken a pronounced posi
tion on the money question. He said yes
terday that he did not luily understand
the question, but he was very confident
that the rank and file would accept the
platform of the National Democratic Con
vention and that there would be no dis
ruption of the party whether gold or silver
was indorsed.
Campbell P. Berry, Assistant United
States Treasurer and formerly member of
Congress from this State, has positive
views on public questions, but he is not
ready at the present time to make a public
exposition of his principles. He has kept
entirely out of the local factional disputes
of the party.
Will S. Green, Surveyor-General, is very
frank and outspoken in declaring that the
sentiment of the Democratic party in Cali
fornia is not for the free coinage of silver.
He has prepared a financial plank, which
may be put in the platform at Sacramento.
Here is the plank:
Resolved, That the Democratic party is in
favor of bimetallismâ ln favor of the largest
use of silver consistent with keeping gold aud
silver on a parity, and to that end is in favor
of securing some international agreement as
favorable as possible to the use of silver, but
pending such negotiations it favors: First,
the retirement from circulation of all paper
money of every kind except certificates paya- |
blc exclusively in silver, these certificates to i
be issued in denominations of $1, $2, $5 and
$10; second, the retirement from circulation
of all gold coin under the double eagle or
#20 piece.
Speaking on the subject yesterday Mr.
| Green said: "The adoption of this reso
lution will recognize gold as the standard j
and silver as the circulating medium. The
sentiment of the people of California
is favorable to gold. California is
j not a silver State in the sense of desiring
the free coinage of silver. Some noisy talk
â  era are proclaiming for free silver, but they
do not represent the Democratic party. Yes,
I am sure the administration of President
Cleveland will be indorsed by the State
Convention of the party at Sacramento
and by the National Convention at Chi
cago, and I do not apprehend any disrup
tion or bolting. No other than Grover
Cleveland Democrats will be sent to the
Chicago convention from this State."
Colin M. Boyd, a well-known Democrat,
who has served as Auditor and chairman
of the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, cares not a blank whether the
State Convention indorses gold or silver.
! He said: "1 am so earnest as Fire Com- i
I missioner in my desire to keep the Fire
j Department out of politics that I deem it
i wise to keep out of politics myself. Again,
I as a matter of fact, I do not understand
what the free coinage of silver means, and
I think The Call should enlighten the
people of both parties as to the real mean
ing of the agitation. Now, only to-day a
leading man, the president of a well
known insurance company, told me that
he didn't know anything about the sub
ject, and when he asked me what I under
stood free coinage of silver to mean I told
him that my understanding of it was that
a man could take his silver to the mint, a
ton or less at a time, and get it coined into
silver dollars."
Barney D. Murphy of Ban Jose said yes
terday: "It would give me pleasure to
go to the National Convention if I could
go uninbtructed, but I would not go tied
up with pledges to favor the free coinage
of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 or 40 to l.tln
my opinion we might as well have it 40 to
lasl6to 1. lam glad that the people are
coming to their senses on the money ques
tion. Our people in California cannot
afford to have the gold standard abol
ished."
RODGERS MAY DIE.
Thrown From Ills Buggy by an Klec
trlc-Car on Twenty- Third
Avenue.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 26.â John W.
Rodgers, entry clerk and collector for W.
A. Rouse & Co. of this city, is lying at the
point of death at the home of T. F. Evans
on Twenty-third avenue to-night, and the
attending physician holds out no hope of
bis recovery, as he is suffering from inter
nal injuries received about 11 o'clock when
an electric-car hit his Duggy and threw
him across the wheel.
He had been in the store on business,
and as be came out he noticed a car com
ing down the street, but as his horse was
thoroughly gentle he paid no attention to
it. but stepped into his buggy. The horse
for some unknown reason backed a step or
two, and, as the avenue is very narrow,
the rear wheel of the buggy was thrown
across the track.
Rodgers is only 26 years of Â»ge, and has
a wife and little girl. He has been with
the firm by which he is employed since
his marriage four years ago. He recently
took out an insurance in the Woodmen of
the World.
Reports as to the speed of the car vary,
but the fact that it did not break the buggy
goes to show that it must have been going
slow. The motorman Bays be had reduced
the apeed as he saw the buggy, but he had
no idea of the rig coining on the track.
When it did he applied the brake, but it
was too late to stop.
A HUSBAND AND
HIS TWO NAMES.

QUEER TALE UNFOLDED
She Came Across the Plaiflsl
With Mrs. Jane Stan
ford.
HUSBAND'S COUNTERCHARGE.
He Says His Wife Left Him and Her
Child for aSiQ Francisco
Physician.
Several days ago a complaint was filed
with the County Clerk entitled Margaret
Ham ts. Daniel T. Ham. It was the initial
step in an action for divorce and distribu
tion of community property.
The grounds alleged were extreme
MRS. HAM (VIERTONG). WHO IS SIIXG FOR A DIVORCE.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
cruelty and the value of ihe property was
placed at about $6000. This commonplace
wording excited no special interest at the
time.
It now transpires, however, that the de
fendant Ham is no other than A. O. Vier
tong of Stockton, a well-known mining
man and capitalist, who is estimated to be
worth half a million dollars.
It is doubtful if a dozeu of Viertong's
friends know that his real name is Ham.
In the early days he was a theatrical man
and afterward married, and assuming the
maiden name of his mother has gone by it
ever since.
Twenty years ago, as Viertong (Ham)
tells the story, he met a handsome Creole
widow in Dayton, Nev. Her name was
Mrs. Coddiugton. He was a dashing young
fellow with plenty of money, and a mutual
attachment sprang up between them.
They finally decided to throw in their lots
with one another.
Several years later they moved to Sucra
mento, and in 1891 they were made legally
one, the difficulty before beine that the
handsome widow, who bad been blessed
with three prior husbands, had not been
properly separated from "hubby" No. 3
until that time. She was married to Vier
tong on Christmas night, lxtl.
They lived together happily ail these
years until about five months ago, when
sue left her handsome home in Stockton
and came to this City to place herself
under the treatment of a prominent phy
sician, She came with her husband's
consent. He was loving and indulgent.
The good man, so he says, gave her s3(soo
and a power of attorney. He was away a
large portion of the time looking after "his
mining interests in Tuolumne and Shasta
counties of this State and also in Nevada.
It was natural that he should not want
her to become embarrassed for lack of
funds during his long absence, hence his
trusting her with a power of attorney.
Mrs. Ham (Viertong) is 50 years of age
and a grandmother. In spite of her years
and her some 200 pounds, the surplusage
of which is not ungraceful adipose tissue,
she is quite attractive. She took rooms
on Mission street, not far from Fifth.-
Soon after her arrival in the City, bo her
husband says, Â«he made the acquaintance
of a yonng doctor. The medico seemed to
be charmed by the buxom Mrs. Viertong
( Ham), and she, being Mattered at first.soon
became much enamored of her attentive
admirer.
"He induced her to buy a lodging-house
for several hundred dollars," said her hus
band, "and he then took up his abode with
her. I was not long in rinding it out, and
j when I came down here a few days ago I
made tnings warm for the young man.
He moved. I have thirty days in which
to answer the complaint, and with the two
food lawyers I have engaged in Stockton
expect to make it warm in the neighbor
hood before I get through. She has left
her comfortable home and our little
adopted daughter. Panxy, and seems lost
to all but one thought.
"Her reason for setting the amount of
the community property at snch a low
figure in her complaint was because she
thought she could secure the separation so
much easier. Already her conduct has
caused me to lose nearly $100,000 in a min
ing deal."
After the legal fight is ended Mr. Vier
tong (Ham) says he will attend to another
fightâ that of the young medico â and
make the latter sorry that he ever paid
his gallant attentions to other men's
wives.
Mrs. Ham. as she prefers to calLherself,
came across the plains in the same train
with Mrs. Jane Stanford of Palo Alto.
Her maiden namfi was Margaret Nail.
Viertong is well known as the inventor
of several improvements in mining ma-
I chinery and was instrumental in sending
the schooner Hayseed to Cocos Island
some years ago in search of buried
treasure.
"Her allegations of cruelty I deny in
toto," he said, -'and all of onr Stockton
friends are aware of the fact that I have
been an indulgent â over-indulgent â hus
band. She has abused my indulgence and
liberality, and before she and her medical
accomplice get through with me they will
find that an indulgent husband is not all
indulgence."
Mrs. Ham (Viertong) was seen, but she
declined to discuss :ier side of the case.
Sbe contented herself with the assertion
that sbe would compel the tolling of the
whole story when the time came.
And the tale is not half unfolded.
RAYMOND AVILES' THREAT.
Kx- Fireman of the Lolt Collins Writes
About Bnioide.
Coroner Hawkins received a letter yes
terday from a writer claiming to be Ray
mond Aviles, who was fireman on the
steamer Colima, which Bank May 27, 1895â
a year ago to-day. The letter is as follows :
San Francisco, Cal., May 26, IS9G.
Coroner of San Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir:
When you receive this letter I be dead to the
world. It be a year ago to-morrow that 1 was
saved from the Colima oft Manzanillo after so
many hardships, and now I am tired of living.
I take my own life in the cold waters of the
bay. Raymond aviles,
Ex-flreman of the Colima.
The whereabouts of Aviles could not be
ascertained yesterday. Some of his friends
said that he bas not been well-balanced
mentally since the steamer was lost.

CATHOLIC BROTHERHOOD.
Subject of an Address by Father
Mulligan to an Open
Meeting.
He Points Out the Duties and Rights
of the Members of the
Y. M. I.
Mission Opera Hall was well filled last
night by tue friends, of Borromean Coun
cil No. 129, Y. M. 1., under whose auspices
the first of a series of weekly open meet
ings was held.
The exercises opened with a well-ren
dered overture on tne piano by Professor
D'Arcy. R. R. Dinnigan contributed to
the evening's entertainment by singing.
Father P. E. Mulligan then p.ddressed
the assemblage on "Catholic Fraternity."
He said in part:
"I wish to pay something to the yonng
men on the duties of fraternity and the
rights of fraternity. Fraternity is a thing
of Christian origin. In the days of
paganism fraternity was unknown. It be
gan with the advent of Christ. With the
coming of Christ men first began to real
ize the existence and value ot brotherhood
and fraternal charity."
It was due to this feeling, he declared,
that slavery was wiped out of existence.
He proceeded as follows:
"As members of a fraternal body you
hold a dignity which also carries duties.
These are the times when you should be
faithful to duty. These are the times
when men may point their fingers at you,
and you should show what manhood there
is among the Catholic young men. You
should make your lives snch that no one
can point the finger of scorn at you, and
your living example should bo such as to
make those among whom you live realize
that there a.re good principles which
govern you: that the Catholic young man
is entitled to the highest respect and
honor.
"Besides the duties you have you also
have rightsâ rights most sacred aud that
should not be violated. We have the
right to worship in freedom and as we
deem fit."
He then referred to the labors of Cath
olics in the discovery and settlement and
in the preservation of this country through
the Revolution and|the Civil War. In line
with this tboujtht he continued.'
"Is it right, then, to say that Catholics
are not loyal and should not be allowed to
nold public office?"
He concluded by exhorting his hearers
to spread the grand principles of religion,
without which, he said, no country was
stable and no nation safe.
Frank McGlvnn spoke of the objects of
the Yonng Men's Institute, which, he
said, was organized for the moral, social
and intellectual advancement of its mem
bers. "Politics," he added, "are strictly
tabooed in the order, and there is nothing
in the order that should prevent a good
American citizen from joining it."
MissA^ncs O'Brien's solo was followed
by a humorous recitation by Dr. J. P. Mc-
Carthy, who was forced to respond to an
encore. Frank McGlynn closed the enter
tainment by some of his characteristic
declamation?.

SPIRITUALISTS

Elected by Unanimous
Vote.
C. H. WADSWORTH, PRESIDENT.
President Barrett Receives a Hand

The spiritualistic convention bpened yes
terday morning with Mra. Ella Wilson
Marchant of San Bernardino in the chair.
Brief speeches on organization were
Some Prominent Members of the Spiritualistic Cult Elected to Office In the State
Association at the Convention Yesterday.
made by William Burgess, Arthur C. Green,
Mrs. Baxter Reynolds, Mrs. E. Seeley,
Mr?. Kate Hnseman, Dr. C. H. Rin-Es, Mrs.
W. K. Robinson, Mrs. M. A. Ellis and Pro
fessor Mingo.
Mrs. Kate Hnseman, delegate from Oak
land, on behalf of the societies of that
city, extended an invitation to the conven
tion to be presenc at a banquet in Hamil
ton Hall at 2 p. m. to-day.
It was stated that President Barrett
would leave for Portland Thursday.
I his was a conference session and was
broken up by numerous short recesses. The
bulk of the business was transacted in the
afternoon.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
A Constitution Drafted and a Spirit
Communication to Mrs.
Whitney.
The afternoon session was opened with
the singing of "Scatter Seeds of Kind
ness." Everybody santÂ» with a will, not
withstanding the intense heat of the day
kept the fans of the audience in continual
motion.
Mrs. R. Scott-Briggs, an Oakland repre
sentative, who has been actively engaged
in tbe cause of woman suffrage, both in
the Ea;t and on the Pacific Coast, was in
troduced by Mrs. May Drynan, acting
chairman for the session, and made a
speech on organization and the general
welfare and condition of tbe spiritual
cult. During her speech she paid an elo
quent tribute to the president of the
National association. Harrison D. Barrett.
"With such a man as he at the head of
tbe association," she said, "how can we
do anything else than climb higher up
the ladder of ethical principles and spiritu
ality? I tell you, my dear friends, the
amount of time and fervor this man has
thrown into the cause ought to make us
feel proud of him, and rest assured that
the welfare of our religion is in the safest
of hands."
At the conclusion of her speech Mrs.
Scott-Briggs invited Mrs. Kate Hoskins
of the Minneapolis Spiritualistic Society
to address the representatives. The lady
accepted the invitation and made a rather
lengthy address upon the advantages that
would result from organization, and the
disadvantages from living out in the cold,
hard world.
"We are going to organize," she stated,
"and there is nothing that we must let
stand in the way. In the vocabulary of
Spiritualism there is no such word as
fail."
Next came Professor Mingo, a colored
medium well known in local spiritualistic
circles. The gentleman admitted, prior to
his argument for organization and better
treatment of true mediums by the laws of
the land, that his record in the past had
been as black as the ace of spades, where
upon the audience howled their approval.
"But there is one thing I deny," he
vehemently added, "and that is that dur
ing the two years I have been a medium
no man can cast the faintest shadow upon
my recoru in that direction."
Now came the event of the day. The
committee appointed to draft a constitu
tion filed in slowly, a solemn hush falling
upon the assemblage. William Yeaw of
San Francisco then stepped forward and
stated that the committee had agreed upon
a constitution, which would be read by
President Barrett.
Mr. Barrett prefaced the reading with a
short account of how they bad arrived at
certain conclusions-.
The document was of great length, com
prising twenty-three closely written pages.
The space taken up by the preamble,
which gave merely the "principal reasons
for union, was considerable. Mmy parts
also were devoted simply to parliamentary
rules, laws concerning the officers' duties
and financial propositions.
Those clauses of vital import are as fol
lows:
Article Iâ The name of this association shall
be the California State Spiritualists' Associa
tion, and it shall be incorporated by such title
under the Ikws of the State of California.
Article llâ The objects of said association
shall be the organization of the various local
epintuali-tic societies of the State of Califor
nia lor the purpose of mutual aid and co-oper
ation in benevolent, charitable, educational,
literary, musical, scientific, religious and mis
sionary purposes germane to the phenomena,
science, philosophy and religion of spiritual
ism ; to own and hold real and personal prop
erty, to solicit and receive donations and be
quests for the above-Btated objects ; to estab
lish, foster and innh;tain children's progress
ive lyceurus in the- State of ( alifornia, and to
devis-e ways an<l means by which tne interest
and welfare of spiritualism may be advanced
in said State.
Article VI, section Iâ The membership or pri
mary units of tnis association shall consist of
all spiritualists' societies chartered by it, and
they shall send delegates to the annual con
ventions upon the tollowing basis, namely,
one delegate for each chartered society, and an
additions! delegate fpr each twenty members
or major lraction thereof.
Article VIII. section lâ The board of direct-
on mall have the power to ordain spiritual
teachers, upon whom shall be conferred all
the rights and privileges under tbe law en
joyed by tbe clergy of all religious societies
upon proper evidence.
Article VIII, section 2â The applicants mus *
be known as workers of at least one year's
standing, and must be indorsed by tbe officers
of such chartered society connected with this
association as morally and personally repu
table, possessed of inspirational power, and of
at least average educational ability; such ap
plication to be forwarded to the secretary of
this association by the secretary of the local
society through which, under its Â«eal, the ap
plication is made.
Article VIII, section 3â The applicants must
in each case agree to surrender their certifi
cates of ordination if at any time they may, in
the judgment of the board of Directors, upon
proper information from ihe local societies, be
proved unfit to continue holding the same.
Article VIII, section 4â Whenever any hold
ers of papers of ordination from this associa
tion shall have been convicted of any criminal
offense the certificate of organization shall be
forthwith canceled, and all societies of spirit
ualists in the United States notified of such
action by the secretary of this association.
Article IX â We recognize mediumship as the
channel of the Inspiration, progress and power
of spiritualism, and as furnishing evidence of
the truth of the same. To insure the best re
sults mediums need greater protection, en
couragement and assistance in the exercise of
their gifts and aid in case of indigence, and
there shall lie set aside a special fund for such
purpose under the supervision of the board of
directors, all contributions to which fund
shall be appropriated to no other purpose
whatsoever.
Article Xâ The annual convention of this
association shall be held in the City of San
Francisco on the first Friday of September.
The president of the State Association shall
preside and the secretary of said association
shall be secretary of the conventions. The
authorized voters shall be the duly elected
delegates from the various chartered societies.
At these conventions the regular election of
the officers and board of directors for the en
suing year shall take place and all necessary
business be transacted.
The constitution was adopted.
The following committee named the offi
cers: Mrs. J. J. Whitney, Mrs. E. Sloper,
Mrs. Julia Schlessinger, W. H. D. Haru
blev, Mrs. S. Cowell, C. H. Wadsworth, B.
F. Small.
They returned with the names of the fol
lowing to be elected for the coming year:
President, C. H. Wadsworth of San Jose;
vice-president, W. D. J. Hambley of San Jose;
secretary, Mrs. Julia Schlessinger of San Jose;
treasurer, William Ryder; directorsâ Mrs.
Elizabeth Sloper, Mrs.' R. Cowell, S. D. Dye,
George Rogers, Frank H. Parker.
On vote these were chosen to be offi
cers for the term. Mrs. J. J. Whitney,
the secretary, was instructed to cast tae
ballot. Mrs. Julia Schlessinger was also
elected State librarian and Mrs. Sloper
btate organizer.
A rising vote of thanks to President
Barrett was taken for his kindness and
good counsel.
Mrs. "Whitney thereupon arose and
passed into a trance, in which she re
ceived and communicated a spirit mes
sage from J. B. Wolfe, Marian H. Skid
more and Hen^y Higbey, who indorsed
the idea of organization and extended a
blessing. Barrett then arose and said
Wolfe was the same one that had fore
shadowed the National organization to
him four years ago.
An adjournment was taken till tbe even
ing, when a pleasant social time waa en
joyed in the halL
EVENING RECEPTION.
A Pleasant Time Spent by the
Representatives Prior to
Departure.
This waa a brilliant and successful event,
a fitting climax to the convention.
The hail bau been tasteiully decorated,
but for tbe evening's entertainment added
festoons of snowy cheese cloth, gayly be
spangled with squares and triangles ol
gilt, had been hung round the balcony,
and many fresh and fragrant calla lillies,
roses, geranium blossoms aad other
flowers were woven in beautiful designs
and scattered round ttie platform.
The programme for tne occasion con
sisted of instrumental and vocal music,
recitations, readings and speeches. They
were all heartily applauded, and many
were encored. The following was the
programme:
Reading, Miss Jennie Reed; duet, Dr. and
Mrs. ClanO reading, Paul Craig; vocal solo,
Miss Lillian Coleman; Calisthenic drill,
Lyceum children; recitation, MiÂ»s Lillie Wicht;
vocal solo, MrÂ». George Winters; recitation,
Mrs. M. A. Ellis; vocal solo, Mrs. Martha
stimpson; humorous reading, J. J. Morse;
Spanish dance, Miss Ida Queutin.
At the conclusion of the programme
President Barrett was invited to come
upon the platform. He did so, and hardly
iiad he taken his seat when a little girl,
jressed entirely in white, handed him a
small package tied in blue ribbon. With
the gift she deliverea a short and compli
mentary speech, saying that it was a testi
monial of the c.-teem in which he was held
ay the assembled co-workers.
The president of the National Spiritual
rstic Association heartily thanked those
present for the subbtaut la 1 token of their
appreciation, saying that in a year or two
tie would probably return, and hoped be
tvouid then find a large and flourishing or
ganization here.'
"But the real person to whom should be
iue the gratitude of you all is not 1," he
said. ' "It is one who has labored far more
faithfully and disinterestedly than myself
for the success of this convention, and how
tier efforts have, been rewarded the results
we have attained show. She it is who did
more work as a delegate to the Chicago
convention in 1893 than any other one per
son there, who. was so faithful in the per
formance of her duty that she was re
garded in being elected trustee and incor
porator by the unanimous vote of the
convention. The person to whom I have
reference is your State organizer, Mrs.
Elizabeth Sioper."
Hia wows brought down the house and
Mrs. Sloper was uproariously called upon
to say something. In a few apt words she
explained that a severe cold prevented her
making a suitable reply. She said that
the moment was one of the happiest of her
busy liie and that she felt aruply repaid
for her arduous labors of the last few
days.'FggÃQ

gramme and the representatives and their
friends spent â¢ the rest of the evening in
dancing.

LITTLE PETE'S DEFENSE.
He Denies That He Has Been Coining
Bad Money.
To tlie Editor of the San Francitco Callâ Sib:
In the issue of the Chronicle of May 23 there
appeared an article one column in length
headed "Little Pete's Queer Halves." This
article is absolutely false from beginning to
end and does not contain a single statement
that bears even the slightest semblance of
truth. The only conclusion my friends and I
have been able to reach is that the article was
written by some newspaper reporter who was
grossly imposed on by my enemies.
Being a Chinaman I have absolutely no re
course. A retractiou of the article would not
repair the wrong that has been done, and a
libel suit against a powerful newspaper would
prove utterly useless; hence I appeal to your
Daper, which has always been fair and has
always given the use of its columns to people
who have been villified, to publish my side of
the story.
An examination of the article In question
would convince any reporter who has been en
gaged in reportorial work for the period of one
month or more that the statements contained
therein could have been verified by positive
proof, if there was any truth in them. In the
first place it is asserted in the article that the
Chinese actors who came to this country for
the purpose of exhibiting at the Atlanta Fair
were searched when ibey arrived at the port of
San Frnnclsco en route to Atlanta by the cus
toms officers and that belts containing silver
half-dollars were found on their persons, but
that no suspicion was aroused, as it was the
most natural thing in the world for the Chi
nese to change their Chinese money for Ameri
can money prior to leaving China. The Cni
nese referred to did not arrive at the port of
Son Franci>co en route to Atlanta, but on the
contrary came to this country via Vancouver
and went to Ogdensburg, N. V., by the Cana
dian Pacific Railroad and were permitted to
land there by the customs officers.
They did not see Â£an Francisco until after the
close of the Atlanta Fair, which was more than
four months after their original arrival at
Vancouver, and hence was not searched by the
customs officers in this City, nor did the cus
toms officers in this City find any belts on
their persons which were loaded with silver
half dollars.
. The reporter could have ascertained these
facts by an examination of the records of the
Custom House and the steamship company.
Furthermore, the reporter could have ascer
tained frum Secret Service Agent Harris, who
has exclusive control of the investigation of
charges of making or uttering counterfeit
money, that there was absolutely no evidence
against me, or any one connected with me, to
sustain the charges contained in the article,
and that in addition to this it had never been
intimated by any of the Federal officers that I
was even suspected of being Implicated in any
business of this character.
I called upon Secret Service Agent Harris
and demanded of him an inspection of the
complaint or charges which had been preferred
agbinst me, if any, or that he submit any evi
dence he might have against me to the Federal
Grana Jury, with which course I would be per
fectly satisfied, but he informed me. and au
thorized me to state, that he has absolutely no
evidence against me, and no person had 'pre
ferred any enarge* against me, or in any way
implicated me in the manufacture or uttering
of this fraudulent money.
I again beg of you to give space to this letter
in your paper, as it is unfair that the columns
of a great paper like the Cnronicle should
publish such a slanderous article against me
dimply because I am a Chinaman.
I venture to say thatlhe reporter who wrote
the article would not publish such a statement
against any white man in the City and County
of Sau Francisco without verifying the cor
rectness of his statement before publication.
Very respectfully yours, Fong Ching.
FIGHTERS IN HOT WATER.
The Supervisors Have Revoked
All Licenses for Boxing
Bouts.
Club Managers Contend the New Reso
lution Will Not Interfere With
Their Sport
The managers of the Shannon benefit
boxing exhibition and the National Ath
letic Club were dumbfounded yesterday
when information reached them that the
Supervisors at Monday's session revoked
all boxing licenses under order 1834,
which confers the power on the Mayor to
grant such licenses, and that in future per
mission for the holding of boxing enter
tainments must be obtained from tne
Supervisors and not from Mayor Sutro.
The lovers ol boxing were astonished
that the Supervisors should at thie late
hour conclude to regulate matters boxing
according to their own way of thinking,
which is quite frequently peculiar to the
majority of sporting men.
The manager of the People's Palace,
Cliff Phillips, said that the resolution
would in no wise interfere with his exhi
bition, which was booked to take place
to-morrow evening; but there are others
who, politically speaking, are in the same
swim that do not hesitate to say that Mr.
Phillips is laboring under a delusion, and
that tne contest will not be allowed to go
on according to Queensbury.
Phillips says t.iat as seven of the Super
visors have already signed Shannon's pe
tition for a license he cannot understand
how the entertainment can possibly be
interfered with because of a prohibitory
resolution just recently adopted.
The officers of tbe National Club are of
the opiuion that the taking away of the
Mayor's power to issue boxing licenses
will not affect tbe exhibitions now adver
tised to take place.
"You must remember," said one of the
leaders of the National Cub, "that we
have been under a very heavy expense,
which we certainly would not incur if the
Mayor had refused to give us permission
to bold a boxing exhibition iv June. lam
satisfied that the Supervisors when adopt
ing such a resolution as stated intended
that there shall be no further boxing exhi
bitions following the contests now sanc
tioned by the Mayor unless such licenses
for the holding of boxing exnibitions are
granted by the Board oi Supervisors."
LEAGUE OF THE CROSS.
Two Branches of the Well-Known Order
Instituted.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 26.â A branch of
the League of tbe Cross ties been estab
lished in St. Patrick's Church in Wert
Oakland with thirty-six members enrolled.
The oflicers elected are: William Drake,
captain; William Flanagan, first lieuten
ant; James McQuaid, second lieutenant;
Henry Sheeban, treasurer. Father Mc-
Nally expects to increase the membership
to 300 within tbe next, two weeks.
A branch ot tbe same order has been es
tablished in the St. Francis de Sales
Church under the personal direction of
Rev. Thomas McSweeney. This evening
they held a reception and entertained the
company from St. Mary's Cathedral, San
Francisco. Tae latter made a tine appear
ance as they marched up the street headed
by their drum corps and with v beau'iful
silk American flag floating over them.
The League of the Cross is new on this
side of the bay, but promises to flourish
now that it has been established. The
members are all pledged to temperance
until 21 years of age, are uniformed and
drilled with saber. It is much ot the same
as the Boys' Brigade in Protestant
churches.
VICTORY FOR
COAST SHIPPERS
Now Possible to Extend
Trade Relations With
Utah.
FREIGHTS FOECED DOWN
Result of the Campaign Mapped
Out by Traffic Manager
Curtis. '
CAN COMPETE WITH THE EAST.
The New Rates Will Go Into Effect
on the 15th of Next
Month-
Through the joint c.Torts of W. B. Cur
tis, manager- of the Traffic Association,
and J. C. Stubbs, traffic manager, and C.
F. Smurr, general freight agent, of the
Southern Pacific Company, California has
has been piaced in a position to take a
great stride forward in her commercial re
lations with Utah and the intervening ter
ritory.
Until within a comparatively short time
for some unaccountable reason California
has been handicapped in her efforts to place
goods in the Utah market against com
petition from tbe East. This was dvÂ« to
the discriminative rates forced upon the
Pacific Coast by the action of the roads
entering Utah from the East. They were
enabled to hold the West in thrall owing
to the fact that the Central Pacific Rail
road ran to Ogden and thence bad no dis
tributing facilities except ever the roads
entering Ogden and the surrounding ter
ritory from the East, and the local rates
out of Ogden were made virtually prohibi
tive to California freight as the Eastern
roads were desirous of securing the long
haul from tbe East into Utah and averse to
taking only tha short haul out of Ogden.
They were allowed to have their way un
til Traffic Manager Curtis of the Traffic
Association conceived a plan by which to
force the Eastern roads to do justice to
California. He ciaimea that California
shippers were entitled to the same rate
per ton per mile into Utah as was enjoyed
by the merchants of Chicago, but his de
mand made at a special meeting of the
trans- Missouri roads held at Salt Lake was
refused.
His efforts hare in all cases been warmly
seconded by the Southern Pacific people,
and when the Salt Lake meeting resulted
in temporary defeat the Southern Pacific
Company began to cut rates to such an
extent as to permit goods to be landed at
Ogden and to be distributed under tbe
heavy and unfair tax imposed by the local
rates out of Ogden at much less than the
rates in force from the East.
Last week there was another meeting of
the trans-Missouri lines at which this
matter was again discuÂ«sed and the con
cessions asked for by California represen
tatives was there granted.
Traffic Manager Curtis thus outlines the
situation ana its significance to local job
bers, importers and manufacturers:
"When class rates from tbe Missouri
River to Utah were $2 50 for first class,
|2 15 for second, $1 75 for third, $1 45
fourth. $1 25 fifth, $1 10 for class A, 92c
for class B, 82c for class C. 72c for class D
and 62c for cla*s E, rates from San Fran
cisco to Utah were Bo}< per cent of trie
same, as follows: First class $2 14, sec
ond class $1 84, third class $1 50, fourth
class $1 24, fifth class $1 07, class A 94c,
class B 79c, class C 70c, class D 62c and
claas E 53c.
"These rates were so made upon agree
ment between the lines operating west of
the Missouri itiver and the Southern Pa
cific Company, operating between San
Francisco ana Utah. The lines leading
west from the Missouri River later arbi
trarily reduced their rates without giving
the Southern Pacific Company due notifi
cation, to the following figures: First
cia:Â«s $1 65, second class $1 55, third class
$1 55, fourth class $1 33. fifth class $1 13,
class A $1 03, class B 83c, class C 75c,
class D 65c, class E 57c.
"The Pacific Coast had long felt that
this adjustment of rates into Utah was
not one calculated to stimulate trade from
here. In fact tbe increased number of
lines entering Utah from the cast and the
disposition of those lines to hold hard and
fust to all possible business, irrespective
of our rights, served to well nigh strangle
the last vestige of Pacific Coast trade in
Utah.
"The arbitrary action of the lines lead
ing west from the Missouri River in re
ducing their rates to the figures named
served to open negotiations looking to a
better basis for rates from the West as
compared from the East to Utah.
"In my opinion the consistent basis
would have been that San Francisco rates
should be 70 per cent of the Missouri
River rates to Utah.
"At the time tbe Eastern lines put in
the $1 65 scale all rates from San Fran
cisco to Utah common points were virtu
ally nullified in that the original basis
had been abolished, and the Eastern lines
refused to agree for the time being upon
what we considered a proper basis.
"At the recent meeting at Denver on
the 21st and 22d irst. tlie matter was
fully canvassed by the Trons- Missouri As
sociation, every line interested being rep
resented. At this meeting a new agree
ment was entered into by the lines inter
ested in Utah traffic by which the rates
from San Francisco to Utah should be 75
per cent of any rate made from the Mis
souri River to Utah, and it was also agreed
that the rates from Missouri River to
Utah should be advanced to the following
figures: First class $2 30, second cla>s $2,
third class $1 70, fourth class $1 43, fifth
class $1 18, class Asl 08, class B 93 cents,
ciass C 85 cents, class D 70 cents, class E
62 cents.
"Seventy-five per cent of these figures
makes the rates from San Francisco to
Utah as follows: First class $1 73, second
ciass $1 50, third class $1 28, fourth class
$1 C 7, fifth class 89 cents, class A 81 cents,
class B 70 cents, class C 64 cents, class D 53
cents, class X 47 cents."
The new rates wilJ apply from Ban Fran
cisco^ to Ogden, Provo, Spnngville, Spau
ish Fork and points intermediate thereto,
and also as far north as Pocateilo, Idaho,
and will also apply to all intermediate
points on the Southern Pacific road, San
Framisco to O^den as a maximum. This
application of the new figures will reduce
rates from San Francisco to White Plains,
Nev., and east. To White Piains, for in
stance, the present rate of $2 on first-class
freight will be reduced to $1 73, and the
rate of 53 cents on class E freight will be
reduced to 47 cents.
Commodity rates will be reduced on the
same basis, and westbound business from
Utah 10 California will also benefit by -.he
new arrangement, as it will be charged
only 75 per cent of the rate eastbound
from Utah to the Missouri River. The
same rates will also apply between Port
land and Utah.
Heretofore San Francisco has not done
to exceed 25 per cent of the business into
Utah, and under the advantages of the
new rates it is said she should do not less
than 50 per cent of it, m she is now in bet
ter condition than she ever was to com
pete for this business against Chicago,
Omaha, St. Louis and New York.
The new rates go into effect on the 15th
of June.
In order to more clearly show the bene
fit to California under the new deal, atten
tion is called to the fact that while under
the old arrangement there was but 36
cents per 100 pounds difference in the first
class rates to Utah from San Francisco
and from the Missouri River in favor of
San Francisco, that difference is now 57
cents and with lower rates prevailing now
than before. On class E the difference was
9 cents. It is now 15 cents, and on the
other classes the differences are in due
proportion.
MILLS COLLEGE:
Graduation Exercises Presented at That
Popular Center of Learning,
OAKLAND, Cal.. May 26.â The gradu
ates of the grammar department at Mills
College presented their graduating exer
cises last night. A very neat printed pro
eramme, adorned with a cluster of golden
poppies, announced the numbers, wnich
consisted of essays, recitations, a Japanese
movement exercise with fans, with a plen
tiful amount of music, both vocal and in
strumental. Of the latter two of the num
bers were for the piano and two for tbe
violin, and all were good. The names of
the graduates and their parts on the pro
gramme were as follows:
Evangeline Switzer, piano solo ; Mabel Gunn,
violin solo; Addie Taylor, recitation; Grace
Oliver, vocal solo; Ethel Weatlake, recitation;
Elna Miller, violin solo; Elizabeth Kimball,
essay: Linda Swanberg, Frencn essay; Kath
eryn Pinkham, vocal solo; Marguerite Miller,
essay ; Amelia Hall, piano solo; Mattie Kirby,
recitation.
The platform was prettily trimmed, and
the class motto, "Do ye nexte thynge,"
was wrougnt in flowers.
At the close of the exercises Miss Wit
tenmyer, the teacher of the grammar class,
spoke a tew words concerning the impor
tance of tbe grammar course as laying a
solid foundation for future study. These
young ladies are now fitted to enter
either the college preparatory or the semi
nary course at Mills, or if they go else
where they are ready for any high school
or normal" school. Several of tt.em have
already taken some study in advance of
their course, and a proper tribute was paid
to their other teachers. The twelve gradu
ates were then formaliy presented to Mrs.
Mills, the president of the college, who
welcomed them with words of apprecia
tion and advice and granted to each a
diploma.
Dr. Hallock, late of Tacoma, followed
with a short address, congratulating them
on the completion of this stage of their
education and pointing them onward to
greater heights. After the forma! exer
cises refreshments were served, and the
pleasant occasion which inaugurated a new
custom in seminary life came to an end.
The seminary and college commence
ment exercises will be held Wednesday
afternoon. On that occasion Signor Foil,
a noted bass singer from London, who is
visiting in California, will be present and
will sing, Professor Lisser accompanying
him on the piano.
The prospect for the coming year of the
school is good, more applications than
usual having been received from prospec
tive students.
A Social Surprise.
BERKELEY, Cal.. May 26.â Berkeley

CHINESE-MADE CIGARS,
The Local White Union Has
Locked Horns With Jacob
Brandt.
Culp's California-Grown Leaf Tobacco
Made Up by a Crew of
Mongolians.
The white nnion cigar-makers of this
City are at present at loggerheads with
Jacob Brandt, who conducts a cigar fac
tory at 411 Battery street. Mr. Brandt has
undertaken to manufacture and introduce
Culp's California natural leaf tobacco,
grown at San Felipe, near Los Gatos. It
was not long before the white cigar
makers discovered that the new cicars
were being made by Chinese. This they
regarded as unfair, particularly as dozens
of competent white cigar-makers were,
and are still, idle.
A committee from Cigar-makers' Union
No. 228 called upon Mr. Brandt with a
view of unionizing his factory and getting
him to employ white men to roll California
tobacco into cigars.
The committee reported to the union
the result of the interview, whereupon the
secretary was instructed to write to Mr.
Brandt a letter setting forth the following
Â»entiments. That his answers were not
sufficiently definite, positive or satisfac
tory. The union desires to encourage the
production of California leaf tobacco and
the manufacture of cigars therefrom, but
it is the white man and not the Chinese
who is the consumer, and it should be the
white man and not the Chinese who should
make these cigars. Inquiries had been
received as to the character of the help
employed in Mr. Brandt's factory, but the
union had refrained from giving out in
formation hoping that the factory would
become a union factory.
Unless a satisfactory answer was given
as to the class of cigar-makers Mr. Brandt
intended to employ the union would be
compelled to inform the public that Mr.
Culp's California-grown tobacco is handled
by Chinese. There was no intention of in
terfering with any man's business, but it
was the duty of the union to prevent Chi
nese absorbing and controlling what should
prove a great industry in the future, be
sides protecting white labor.
Tnis letter did not have the desired ef
fect, because, as stated, Mr. Brandt con
tinues to have the only California tobacco
made into cigars by Chinese laborers. Last
light the Cigar-makers' Union held a
special meeting, and a com lm it tee of ten
was appointed to attend to the matter of
BrandYs Chinese. After a little delibera
tion the following otticial manifesto was
issued by the committee:
To the public in general and the smokers in
particular we issue this appeal on behalf of
the cigar'makers of the Pacific Coast. We de
sire to submit the following facts, which have
occurred in the course ot our negotiations
with Jacob Brandt. In the early part of Ajwll
ft committee called on Mr. Brandt, at his re
quest, to endeavor to have him manufacture
California tobacco into cigars by white men.
Jacob Brandt expressed himself very favorable
at that time and gave us every assurance that
he would employ none but international union
cigar-makers to make California-grown to
bacco into cigars. But Mr. Brandt's statement
was very Indefinite as to time, which might
mean months or a year.
In reply to the report of the committee the
uuion sent a communication, of which the fol
lowing is a copy (referred to in the foregoing),
which excited the ire of Mr. Brandt.
Now Mr. Brandt will not run a uuion factory
nor will he employ members of the Cigar
makers' Union, nor will he pay the biK of
prices, advocated by the Cigar-makers' Union
Jso. 228. He declared that he will manufac
ture California-grown tobacco into cigars by
Chinese labor.
The cigar-makers issue this appeal to the
prib lie with the hope and expectation that the
public will give him the rebuke which he so
richly deserves, until such time as Mr. Brandt
will employ white, fair-paid labor.

Foresters.
SATELLITE CIRCLE LEADS
Seceders From the Ukiah Con
vention Being Generally
Sustained.
A NEW ORDER MAT BE FORMED
Companions of the Forest Will No
Longer Submit to Falconer's .
" Despotism."
Tbe disaffection that has been brewing
in the rants of the Companions of the
Forest, the causes of which have already
been discussed at length in The Call,
found expression last night in the action
of Satellite Circle in support of the twen
ty-nine delegates who seceded from the
convention at Ukiah.
Not only was the course of the seced'ng
delegates commended, but the circle, dis
gusted with the actions of what is known
as the Falconer faction, voted to surrender
their charter and withdraw their funds
from the Grand Lodge.
Last night's meeting was spirited
throughout, and the communications
from the Grand Lodge were disdainfully
tossed into the waste-basket.
As to the future course of the lodge noth
ing definite was finally decided upon, but
in all probability a new order will be or
ganized. In this they will follow thei
precedent established last year by Alca
traz Lodge, which withdrew in a bddy,
some 200 strong, and established a new
order.
The cause of the trouble, as staled be
fore, was the alleged autocratic behavior
of Secretary Falconer, whose actions at
length, so the seceders say, became unen
durable. Falconer holds the permanent
position of grand secretary, and it is snid
aspires not only to fill this office but to
exercise a general management of the
order. An effort lately made to make this
office elective obtained a majority vote,
but not the necessary three-fourths vote.
Many reports are being circulated of
something even worse than despotism on
the part of Falconer. One of the dele
gates, it is said, who opposed Falconer
was approached by the secretary on the
train and told that if she would write an
apology to him he would not report her
or fine her, as he intended doing with the
seceders. Wishing to avoid notoriety, the
lady agreed to do this, but Falconer there
upon, instead of Keeping his oromise, not
only fined and reported the lady, but
made public her apology as well.
The action of the twenty-nine delegates
in withdrawing from the convention is
generally upheld by the circles they repre
sented, ana some of the other circles,
whose delegates supported the Falconer
faction, have determined nevertheless to
support the bolters. An agitation is al
ready being carried on to exclude men
from the order of tlie Companions of the
Forest, and in this way they hope to
finally rid themselves of the "little czar,"
as they derisively term Falconer.
Among the seceding members are five
officers of the Grand Lod^e â Treasurer
Boehm, Sub-Chief McLane, Inner Guard
Boyd, Left Guide Humbert and Herald
Macrett. Besides these officers the repre
sentatives of the following circles will
doubtless be upheld in tbeir action in
leaving the convention: Satellite, Social,
Bohemian, Twin Peaks, Oak Grove and
Mizpah circles of San Francisco; Pied
mont and Pride of the Forest and Enter
prise circle, of Oakland, Queen of the Red
woods Circle of Ukiah, Valley Circle of
Stockton, Garden City Circle of San Jose,
Ramona Circle of San Diego and Sunshine
Circle of Merced.
Improvements Are Asked.
The Board of Supervisors received a com
munication signed by several hundred
property-owners ie the neighborhood of Buena
Vista Park-yesterday asking that in the next
tax lew $75,000 be provided for the improve
ment of the public pleasure ground. The peti
tioners stated that under present circum
stances the park is useless except as a refuge
for tramps.

PASSENGERS TO BE IDENTIFIE]
Not in Favor With the Railway
Management Owing to the
Punching Necessary.
General Manager Vining of the Market
street Railway Company declares that as
soon as the order relating to transfers is
finally Dassed by the Supervisors the com
pany stands ready to obey it. He added
that some modification of the old system
would probably be adopted, but just what
he was not prepared to say.
E.v.er since the transfer complications
have attracted public attention Mr. Vining
has been in receipt of suggestions from
people not only in this City but from those
in the larger cities of the country in refer
ence to solving the problem of preventing
the traffic in transfers.
Among these is a clever adaptation of a
patented device used by the Rochester
Railway Company of Rochester, N. Y.
This, in addition to having the time and
line transferred to punched into it, has a
group of seven miniature faces printed on
it, rive of men and two of women, one of
which is punched to identify the passen
ger. The portraits of the men show a
olean-shaved face, one with a mustache,
another with side whiskers, one with chin
beard and one with a full beard. The por
traits of the women are supposed to rep
resent one a blonde and the other a bru
nette.
Underneath these faces appear the fig
ures "40," flanked with a sign of addition
on each side.
The idea is to punch the face nearest
like ihe. passenger to whom the transfer

is issued and to record his approximate
age by punching to the left if he appears
under 40 years of age and to the right if
over that age.
The time limit on the sample transfer
submitted is fifteen minutes, but this can
be increased or reduced at the option of
the issuing company.
By this method it is claimed that the
traffic in transfers will be made virtually
impossible, as it is not likely that within
the Ume limit set a man resembling the
one to wnem the transfer is issued will
turn up as a purchaser of a newspaper
with a transfer premium.
Mr. Vining, speaking of the numerous
suggestions made to him, said that not
one of them was available under the cir
cumstances that existed at Powell and
Market. He explained that every second
of the conductor's time was fully occu
pied from the moment his car stopped at
that point until it again started. The
conductor had to punch his checks and
pass them around to the passengers, then
he had to assist in working the turntable
and to collect the fares before the car
started, and all this, he added, bad to be
done often within a minute and a half.
He explained further that under the
check-transfer system a whole bunch of
checks could be punched at one time by
the conductor, wnile if the identification
transfer were ussd the conductor would
have to make four separate punches for
each passenger, which would require more
time than Be ever had, and would be a
physical impossibility, when, as was often
the case, the car contained between sixty
and seventy passengers.
"Why could not these transfers be given
to each passenger as he paid his fare?"
was askea.
â¢'Well," replied Mr. Vining, "we do that
on some of our cars and it has caused
complaint."
THEY ARE SATISFIED.
The Newsboys Care Little Whether
Or Not the Check System
Is Stopped.
Little Eddie Greaney, the newsboy,
more familiarly known as "Brick," has
Tery set idea* regarding the streetcar
check and transfer system.
He bas devoted much time to thinking
about it âin fact bis fellow-newseya
around Powell and Market streets ascribe
the solar hue cf his locks to the great
amount of thought he has given in the
premises.
"Dat man Vinin' is a dead wise guy,' :
he assured a Call reporter last evening.
"He won't do a t'inp to der public now
dat de Sup's has gone and dabbed 'im on
der transfer system.
"You know what he has the gall to
pay ? ' And the little solon of Cape Horn
overlooked asking a passenger for bis
transfer check as be drew himself up aud
demanded an answer.
"He says he's been makin' |75 a day wit
de check system, showin' dat we kids use
to do 'im to dat amount every day when
der was only transfers for us to work.
"He's dead off. We's been makin' just
as mucn as we ever did, and we don't care
if dey change der system or if dey don't
"Deonly ting aat eats us is dat Vinin'
is doin' der public and der public is our
friends.
"Dat $75 he's a been makin' is from aer
guys who wouldn't get out an' scrap; der
geesers what paid two fares when 'giti
Hie Tragedy of a Warm Day as Enacted in the Mind of an Artist Who Had to Run for His Car.
metly Vinin' only was 'titled to one.
Bee ?'*' â¢
The sentiments of the little man were
heartily indorsed by the Arabs about him.
It was the consensus of opinion that if
every passenger, who, through mistake or
otherwise, held a check instead of a trans
fer, fought for his rights and battled to
remain on the car without submitting to a
second payment of fare, Manager Vining's
receipts would not be $75 greater than they
used to be.
But following up his original line of
thought "Brick" summarized the situation
in his own terse way:
"Vinin' wasn't a rightin' us, he knows
better dan dat. We're too powerful an' he
ain't in our class. We did 'im before an'
we did him after der check system an'
we'll do 'im again. Der is one t'iug we're
'fraid of, an' dats he might quit der trans
fer business and trow der public aud de
kids down at der same time.
"I'm no lawyer an' I don't know if he
kin do dat 'gitimetlr ; but if he does we'll
skate around an* sell papers just like we
use ter do an' I guess we 11 be able to eat
breakfast aa oiteh as he does an 1 enjoy it
just as well."
The youngsters were quite put out that
ihere were no riots on the street. Crowds
scuffling, cheering and hooting had be
come daily and nightly picnics for them.
The weather was so warm yesterday that
people were too enervated to battle for
their rights and they suffered imposition
when a second fare was demanded rather
than resist expulsion from the cars.
The Dimond ordinance, which does
away with the check agents and virtually
restores the transfer system to its old
standing, will come up for final passage
before she Supervisors next Monday, and
then must be signed by the Mayor. As
acting Ma3'or Taylor has already voted in
favor of the ordinance it is quite likely he
will sign the ordinance as soon as passed,
and Third, Powell and Tenth streets, on
Tuesday next, will be unadorned by the
uniformed watchdogs of Manager Vining.

THE POLICE CAUTIONED.
Chief Crowley Says They Must Not
Lend Their Aid In Ejecting Pas
sengers From Cars.
The action of the four policemen in con
nection with the attempt of a conductor
and gripman of a Castro-street car to eject
Fred Wagner, contractor, at Sixth and
Market streets, Monday evening, has called
forth the following notification from Chief
Crowley :
Office of the Chief of Poi.icf, t
Bw Francisco. May StS. 189 G. (
Lieutenant Birdsall: Tfie Chief of Police
din-eta that the following be published to the
oilicers under your command:
It is no part oi the duty of an officer to col
lect fares or to aid in collecting fares on street
cars or elsewhere, nor to eject passengers nor
to aid in ejecting passengers from the cars of
the railroad company for npn-payment of fare.
It is the duty of the officers at all times to pre
serve the public peace and see that no injury
is done to persons or property in their pres
ence.
In case the cars are blockaded or the free
passage of the street or sidewalk shall be ob
structed by a crowd (except on the occasion of
a public meeting) the officers shall disperse or
keep them moving. See subdivision 6, section
26, order 1587. H. 8. Hsaly, Clerk.
Similar notifications were sent to the
captains of the other divisions.
It is not unlikely that the aggressive
conduct of Policeman O'Day in forcibly
throwing passengers off the rear platform
of the Castro-street car will form a matter
for investigation by the Board of Police
Commissioners.
Wagner appeared in Judge Conlan's
court yesterday morning to answer the
charge of battpry preferred against him
by Conductor W. H. Brewster. By con
sent the hearing of the case was fixed for
Friday next^

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 1896.
THE HOTTEST DAY
OF THE YEAR.
And How It Changed the
Ordinary Course of
Trade.
WAS MADE A HOLIDAY.
Sent the People in Search of
Sea Breezes and Shady
Nooks.
IT WILL BE COOLER TO-DAY-
The Weather Prophet Promises Lower
Temperature With a Possible
Fog.
The "steamer" bad along, sizzing sound
yesterday. The steamer has certain no*
table qualities at all times. Yesterday its I
jagged edges rose up in the heated atmos
phere very like a rugged giant in the land,
and men took off their hats to it with a
new reverence. They realized as they had
never before done, what a thing had been
accomplished when California evolved the
steam beer.
Yesterday was a very warm day. Warm
days are uncommon in San Francisco, as
has often been said, and when they take
their lonely place in the calendar, unex
pected as they are, they present curious
studies in temperatureâ the effect of beat
upon men in the mass; how a few degrees
Fahrenheit, more or less, will divest a city
full of people from their accustomed ways
of living.
For instance, the ordinary complexion
of Kearny and Montgomery, and the other
of the busy streets running north and
south, was completely changed by the
slant rays of the afternoon sun. The east
side looked like the chosen path of desola
tion. Scarcely an individual was to be
eeen along its whole length. The blinds
were drawn over the windows and the face
of the buildings glared in the sun blank
and deserted.
Just across the street in the shade, a
difference, say of fifty feet, there was a
contrast presented that, if it continued
the year around, would run up the price of
property over there enormously. The
sidewalk was crowded with people taking
life as leisurely as they could and patron
izing certain lines of trade â the long,
jagged, aizzing "steamer," for instance
in an astonishing fashion.
People are very busy, or Â«ay they are,
and yet it is remarkable how a little
ascent of 4he mercury in the tube will
bring about a holidayâ will practically I
suspend the course of trade. Things that
*were so important that they must be done I
instanter take on a|vague uncertain aspect
and are finally postponed until to-morrow.
The whole City turned its attention yes
terday to getting on the shady side of the
street, so to speak. All business but that
which offered relief trom the heat lan
guisbed like the people. The ferry-boats
were thronged with people all day, a very
great number of whom patronized them
for the fresh air and shelter from the sun
they offered. Crowds of people rode back
and forth between this City. Oakland,
Tiburon and Sausalito without leaving the
boat except to secure and surrender their
tickets.
With East street almost deserted the
ends of the projecting piers were crowded
with people getting as far out in the water
as possible. Streetcars did an immense
business and the Cliff House and other re
sorts were proportionately alive.
And yet it was not hot yesterday as heat
or hot days are reckoned. The highest
mark of the mercury was 91 degrees. At
Fresno it rose to 102. At Los Angeles it
stood at 96 for a time. At Yuma it
climbed to 110.
The forecast artist promises cooler
weather to-day in this City.
AGAINST THE CHARTER.
A Warm but Thinly Attended
Meeting of the Women's
League.
It was a hot night Monday night for the
American Women's Liberal Leacue, and
San Francisco, unused to the slumberous
warmth, preferred to walk in sight of the
blinking stars rather than remain indoors
and perspire.
This was doubtless the reason why not
more than 300 persons gathered within the
classic walla of Metropolitan Temple to
bear arguments why the proposed new
City charter should not be adopted. Seven
eighths of the people present were women,
and they seemed to be disappointed be-
I cause no women appeared on tte stage
and because the oppressiveness of the
evening was not relieved by refreshing airs
or the soul-stirring accents of dramatic
declamation.
Shortly after S o'clock Dr. J. E. Scott
and John M. Reynolds appeared upon the
platform. The doctor, very red in the
face and mopping his brow with a damp
handkerchief, remarked, facetiously, that
it was warm. This happy effort having
been rewarded with a general smile, the
doctor, with another dab at his forehead,
remarked that it was "warmer and warm
est," which caused two or three women in
the front row to titter. Then the doctor,
between wipes, explained that the meet
ing bad been called for the purpose of
showing that the proposed charter should
not be adopted.
John M. Reynoldj, a widely known
writer on politico-economical subjects, I
, was introduced, and #cad a well-digested I
! and thoughtful essay on the charter. He
declared that the 100 reasons advanced by j
Secretary Freud of the Mesc bants' Asso- â 
ciation why the proposed charter should
become the law of this municipality were
j just 100 insults directed at the intelligence
I of the people.
The charter, he declared, had been
j framed in the interest of the monopolies
1 and the corporations, and it placed serious
| stumbling-blocks in the way of the mv-
I nicipal ownership of the water supply,
! lights and so forth. It placed no safe
guards around the municipality that did
not already exist in the constitution and
the laws of the State, and it was a sham
and a fraud.
At the close of the lecture Dr. Scott an
nounced that a young woman who bad
been waiting in one of the back rooms for
the summons to appear upon the stage
and sing the "Star-spangled Banner" had
melted away, and that a gentleman who
was to have made a speech on the charter
had melted into thin air also.
Then the audience got up and melted
out of the doors.
Dinner to President Barillas.
Captain Johnson of the steamer City of Syd
ney and Mrs. Johnson gave an elaborate din
ner yesterday to ex-President Barillas and
Mrs. Barillas of Guatemala at the Baldwin
Hotel. About twenty invited guests were pres
ent. The banquet took place in the banquet
hall. The decorations were uf smilax and La
France rotea. Ex-President Barillas made a
brief and eloquent address reviewing his
pleasure at visiting Sau Francisco.

THE REUNION
OF CHRISTENDOM
An Original Aggressive
Sermon by the Rev.
Dr. Bolton.
HOW TO ACCOMPLISH IT
Anglican, Roman and Orthodox
Fed by Catholic tlhris
tianity.
THE PRIMACY OF ST. PETER.
Rome's Faults, Past and Present.
The Universal Gospel of
Christ.
The midday discourse, delivered on Sun
day at the Episcopal Church of St. Mary
the Virgin by the pastor. Rev. W. W. Bol
ton, is calculated to excite a discussion. It
was entitled "The Reunion of Christen
dom." The tenor of it may be gleaned
from the following excerpts:
"It may be truly said," began the pas
tor, "that among the millions, who this
day in every part of the globe are keeping
the feast of the Holy Ghost, the third per
son of the ever blessed trinityâ there is
one subject strictly akin to the feast itself
that in every earnest mind forces its way
to the front and calls aloud for attention.
This is the reunion of Catholic Christen
dom. For this is the birthday of the
church. This is the day when God the
Holy Ghost came personally to dwell
among men, invisible to the eye, but
known full well to the soul. This is the
day that saw the various members Christ
the son of the eternal God had formed
drawn together and made into a compact
whole, through the one spirit that
breathed himself into them. He made of
many one and intended it so to remain,
but man, in bis own willful way, has
broken up the entity and to-day we find
ourselves in a divided Christendom.
"It is a grief to us. Surely men cannot
better spend the hours of the feast than in
an endeavor to try to find some way in
which the divisions may be healed and
God's creation may yet again stand before
him a whole ana" a perfect thing. It will
not come by compromise. It will come
neither by absorption of the lesÃ, numeri
cally considered, by the greater, nor by
individual conversions, so called, but time
will do it. Let us, however, be careful to
remember when we speak of the longed
for oneness of the church, that there is a
sense in which, though divided, we yet arc
one.
"Catholic Christendom is most inti
mately united. It is one vast compact
body, that feeds Anglican, Roman and
Orthodox alike. We have wrecked the
perfect outward handiwork of God, the
Holy Ghost, and we can give ourselves no
rest until we repair the heinous and out
rageous wrong thus done our God. We
have punished innocent men in the wreck,
for we have been fighting when we should
have been sending tne good news of the
Catholic faith far and wide to every nook
and corner of tne earth. We have also
lost untold blessings for ourselves, for
discipline is slack and the world has
grasped many a position and firmly holds
it that it never would have been able to
take had the church always been one.
"What mean we by the reunion of
Christendom? We mean nothing short of
the constitutional union which existed be
fore the break-up of Western Christendom
in the sixteenth century, together with
union on similar lines with the Orthodox
churches that broke away from the center
of unity long centuries before our own
crash came. There must needs be a center
about which all the scattered forces may
gather, and that center was none other
and is to-day none other than
the Fee of Rome. Men are now too
much in earnest to repair the breaches of
God's earthly Zion to quibble any longer
over what is a fact. Men say that to al
low this is to give away the whole position
of the Anglican cnurch. They say so be
cause they are but surface thinkers. The
church is a sort of pyramid, but it is
something Anglicans cannot agree to that
the pyramid should be turned upside
down and the attempt should be made to
balance it on its top. The papacy is not
the basis of all the rest, but the finishing
stone. Yet because some do pervert it,
that is no reason why we should refuse to
acknowledge the fact that for Christendom
to become one again there must be some
central rallying point, and that this point
is the Apostolic See of Rome.
"Men have come to ignore the rights of
the See of Rome to anj thins at all in the
way of special authority. We may readily
allow that St. Peter was, by the express
wish of Christ, something more than the
rest of the apostolic college, but such is a
very long way off from allowing that he
was to tne rest of the apostles the source
of all that they were. The confusion of
the two things is simply the result of
prejudice. But, do not imagine that the
whole matter would be settled if to-day
Orthodox and Anglican formerly assented
to the primacy of authority residing in
the See of Rome. We should have begun
to see a little daylightâ that is all. The
process of true unity must needs be very
slow. Councils could not do it; decrees
could not at once bring it about. Cen
turies ago men might have been whipped
into line, and a few leaders have pro
nounced that all agreed, but nowadays
such is ck-arly impossible. It will take
time, and all wÂ« have to do is to help it
forward just so far as we can, leaving the
day of its accomplishment wholly out of
mind.
"To Rome's door must be laid in chief
the wrong of disrupting Christendom. In
the good providence of God the papacy
grew to be the great center of Christian
unity, but when it proved false to its true
place and laid claim to more than it really
was men for conscience's sake had to
break away. As an organization we do
believe in the papacyâ -as a doctrine we
cannot. We believe that the hope of re
union centers in Rome, but cannot see
how it can be brought about till Kome bo
other than it now is. When the happy
time has come we shall be as one vast and
united army, fighting sin and the unbn
dleu license of the world. Heresy will feel
our power, schism be a suppliant at our
feet and the light of the glorious gospel ol
Christ shall shine fortn to the ends of the
habitable earth."
LIGHTWEIGHT BOXERS.
First Boats for the Coast Championship
in Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 36.â The pre
liminary bouta of the feather and light
weight contests for the coast champion
ships took place at the Acme Club to
night in the presence of about 750 people.
There -was a alight hitch in the arrange
ments and the feather-weight contest was
not fought, although a special match was
arranged between McMahon of the Olym
pic and Skuse of the Acme.
Skuse and Raphael and Dixon of the
San Francisco Athletic Club were the orig
inal entries in this class. Skuse could not
ge; down to weight and entered the ring
at 131 pounds. Raphael and Dixon re
f usedlto fight unless a $75 trophy was put
up. The club under the association rules j
is not allowed to give a trophy over $35, so
McMahon, weighing 120 pounds, went
against Skuse and bested him in a clever
and neat bout.
The first event was the preliminary
bout in the lightweight class. The con
testants were Tye of the Acme, 134 pounds,
and Kirshner of the Manhattan, 135
pounds. Tye had the best of the match
from the start and played with Kirshner
all through. In the third round the Acme
boy floored his opponent four or five times
and won the fight by a clean knockout.
The third bout was hotly contested.
The Manhattans entered Muller at 135
pounds, and Slamberg entered from the
Acme at 134 pounds. Honors were even
at the end of the third round, and in tbe
fourth Muller fouled Slamberg several
times. The referee awarded the fight to
Slamberg. Muller's temper got the best
of him and he wanted to punch Slamberg
again, but the seconds interfered. Slam
berg put up the best fight.
The last bout was between Muller and
Gooby, the latter from the Acme and

How is it with you ? Are your muscles strong ? Is your
vital power as vigorous as â¢it used to be ? Can you stand the
same amount of exertion you could a few years ago ? Answer
these questions in your own mind and then if you find yourself
in any respect the worse off you must know that there is a reason
for it. What is it ? Excesses, over-indulgence in the pleasures
arid passions of life, may have worn out your vitality.
Maybe you have reached that age when you find the need of
that reserve vital force which nature gives you ; and mayhap
you wasted it when you were young. .
"Burning the candle at both ends" is a common habit, and
it often brings a man to an early grave. Men who should retain
their vigor to a good old age are impotent at 40 and victims of
Nervous Debility at 50.
There is a very interesting book known as "Three Classes of
Men," which will interest every man. , It is by Dr. Sanden, the
inventor 'of Dr. Sariden?s'Ele'ctric Belt. It is worth $100 to any
man who has lost the vigor of manhood. It will, be sent free,
closely sealed, upon application. ;'â ; It gives proof of the cures by

- The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station Indicate maximum tempera*. for the
4ays; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, ot melted snow In inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hlsh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. . When .the pressure is high in thÂ» lnterioi
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. " With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse ot these conditions
will produce an opposite result-

NEW YORK MARKETS.
;"-.â¢; .Financial.
NFW YORK, N. V., May 26.-It was another
dull and uninteresting day at the Stock Exchange.
Transactions were only 103,175 shares. At the
outset the market was inclined to weakness and
prices receded about Ys^Wb per cent, lower prices
from London having li.-d to moderate sales for the
short account by local traders, who for the mo
ment were arrayed on the bear side. The argu
ments advanced by those, working for a decline
were the continued decline in the prices of wheat,
lard, pork and other products; the likelihood of
further engagements of gold for export to Europe
on Thursday and Saturday and the efforts making
in the .senate to change the matter of bond Issues
now in control of the Treasury Department. -
The o>v prices prevailing for products was much
discussed in some circles, and houses with Chicago
connections, comparatively speaking, were fairly
large sellers of the Grangers for this reason. li Is
to be' said, however, that the actual owners of se
curities are not disturbed on account of liquida
tions in wheat, corn and provisions, and the low
record prices made and held to their securities,
notwithstanding the efforts of the i shorts to dis
lodge long stock. Sugar, which was the leader In
point Of activity,' first declined to 121% and then
rose to and closed at 123%, a net gain of 1% per
cent fur the day. .....
Manhattan, a favorite of traders, opened slightly
higher, then dropped to 102%, and later recov
ered to 1033/g. Leather preferred sold off slightly
on the announcement that action on the dividend
had been postponed, on account of the absence of
several members of the executive committee.
.-peculation closed firm 111 ton.-. Net cnanges as a

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lix.. May 26.-Without anything
new on the situation and without any extraordi
nary effort to depress prices the market for wheat
experienced another break this morning. It was
simply a heavy market with the holders who have
been hoping against hope that some accident might
happen which would cause a reversal of the senti
ments, throwing their wheat on the market and
taking their losses with as good grace as possible.
Yesterday and to-day many slop loss orders have
come out and more are expected at each future de
cline. Then? were no Liverpool or Paris cables, it
I being a holiday at those places.
The world s shipments last week were 8,524,000
bushels. The amount on ocean passage increased
1,380.000 bushels. Receipts In the Northwest
were heavy at 514 cars against 464 last Tuesday
. and 382 a year ago. Chicago had 29 cars and in
spected out 93,000 bushels. Berlin closed % mark
higher and Antwerp unchanged. Export clear
ance* were moderate nt 202.391 bushels. Later In
the session a moderate {recovery on covering by
shorts took place. July wheat opened from 60Vgc
to 60c, declined to 59V 8 C closing at 693/gCs&BV^c,
<hj(n :l 4'" under yesterday. Estimated receipts for
to-morrow, 13 cars:
CORNâ Receipts of corn were heavy this morn
ing, 758 cars arriving. The sudden increase In the
movement is ascribed to the continued good
promise of the next crop, and to the fact that i
farmers having a little time on their hands
availed themselves of the opportunity to reduce j
the quantity cribbed. There were no Liverpool !
cables. Withdrawals from store were light at I
61.000 bushels. The amount on ocean passage de- i
creased 640.000 bushels. The market was gov
erned largely by the action of wheat to-day, prices
averaging weak and lower. Export clearances
were 243,160 bushels. Russia shipped 120,000
bushels last week. July corn opened at 28% c,
declined to 28% c. closing at 286fea VsSVic un
der yesterday. .Estimated receipts for to-morrow
525 cars.
OATSâ Fairly active and weak. Local profes
sionals were the best traders. Shorts were able
to cover quite a liberal quantity without affecting
prices. Receipts were heavy at 620 cars. There
were no withdrawals from store. Export clear
ances amounted to 59.708 bushels. July oats
closed Vijfg.Vic lower. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 330 cars. -
FLAXâ Was steady. : Cash, 85c: May. 82% c:
July, , 83c; September, 85% c. Receipts were
13 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The sentiment In provisions was
too weak to be benefited even by a moderate Im
provement in bogs. Speculative!}* the market
was heavy, the action of the grain markets tend
ing to maintain such a tone. At the close Juiv
pork was 7%@10c lower. July lard 10@12%0
lower, and Jul ribs 7%c lower. .
BUTTERâ The butter market to-day was steady.

Similarity of Opinions
General Grant, while walking out in the
suburbs of "Washington, frequently met a
butcher driving a horse to which he took
a strong liking. After much negotiation
he bought the animal and had it taken
to his stable, where one day Senators
Conkling and Jones were invited to look
at the new purchase.
"Well, gentlemen, how do you like the
horse?" askea Grant, after the animal had
been inspected.
"How much did you give for him. Mr.
President?" asked Conkling.
"Four hundred dollars."
"I'd rather have $400 than the horse,"
rejoined Coiikling.
"That's what the butcher thought "
coolly remarked Grant, puffing out a cloud
of smoke; "put him back into the stable

WITHOUT A HOME,
An Unhappy Waif Deserted
by Her Thoughtless
Parents.
NO ONE TO TAKE HER IN
Suffering and Friendless, She Is
Carried From Place to
Place.
DENIED EVEN A LITTLE COT.
Was Left at the Children's Society
Office by an Unknown
Woman.
Oakiaitd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 26. f
One of the prettiest little girls, just six
teen months oM and seriously ill, was car
ried over half the county to-day in a vain
endeavor to find a place to lay its weary,
feverish head.
About 11 o'clock this morning a woman,
who refused to give her name, called at the
Children's Society office and left a lit
tle girl, whose name, she said, is Helena.
Mrs. Prescott, the agent of the society,
was in court at the time, or more questions
would have been asked. As it was, the
attendant took the child and its wardrobe
and kept them till the agent came home.
The story told by the woman is a little
too romantic to suit Mrs. Prescott and she
would like to know more. The woman
said that the little girl was sixteen months
old and her parents were unknown.
She said that some well-to-do people in
this city, whose names she refused to give,
had placed the child in her care, and as
sured her that they would take the neces
sary steps to adopt it. Until two weeks
ago the board bill of the baby had been
regularly paid, and it had been liberally
supplied! with clothes. This income sud
denly stopped, and the people assured the
girl's keeper that they had changed their
mind, and that they do not intend to
adopt it. As she had no means of com
pelling them to take it, and they no longer
paid for its keeping, she took it to the so
ciety, as she could not afford to keep it for
charity.
The examination of the little waif
snowed that it was seriously ill and needed
immediate attention.
The sad-looking little creature was not
only turned out into a cold world, but was
too Bick to be out of her bed, suffering in
tensely with tonsilitis and whooping
cough.
The Fabiola Hospital was asfced to take
her in until she was able to be placed tn
an orphan asylum. The contagious na- j
tare of both di-rases, however, prevented ,'
it. At lJr. Taylor's sanitarium she could
not be received for the same reason.
The little thing was taken to the Chabot
Hou-e, then out to the Children's Home
at Temescal and finally to the West Oak
land Home. At each of these places there
are numerous chiJdren and the matrons
dare not expose them to the risk of conta
gion, much as they would like to help sick
little Helena.
At 5 o'clock, after a hot day's work, Mrs.
Prescott took the child to the Receiving
Hospital hoping to get it in there as an
emergency case, if only for a day or two,
until some arrangements could be made.
It was thought that the unhappy little
rreature could be sent to the County In
rinuary, but little Helena could not be ad
mitted without a permit from Supervisor
Church.
The little child was not even privileged to
occupy one of the white cots of the hospi
tal, and while there it was seized with s
spasm of feverish coughing, and it was
necessary to telephone to Dr. Dunn to re
lieve the paroxysm. When the poor child
was made comiortable Mrs. Prescott gave
Helena shelter for the night beneath her
own roof, and to-morrow she will again
start out and try to find a place where the
unfortunate little waif can be accorded the
privilege of existing.

tions that had not been received. Gardner

OUT FOR CONGRESS.
1 liouiiis Garrity Will Make a Fight for
the Democratic Nomi
nation
OAKLAND, Cal, May 26.â Thomas F.
Garrity, the attorney, announced to-day
that he 'v out for the Congressional nomi
nation from the Third Congressional
Democratic District Convention. He has
been quietly working for some time, but
since Councilman "Old Pard" Bassett an
nounced that be was intending to run as
an independent candidate Garrity has
made extra efforts.
Attorney Garrity is very popular in
Democratic circles and his vote two years
ago when he ran for District Attorney was
surprisingly large in this Republican
county. A politic combination would
probably have landed him a winner.
When asked about his candidacy to-day
Mr. Garrity said:
"I was not aware that the matter was
out- Some of my friends urged me to
allow my itanie to be used in that connec
tion, and I have consented. I have never
held any office, but have always been a
hard worker for tbe party, and as a young
man will be well supported by that por
tion if the party. I am now fully an
nounced as a candidate, and shall push
my claims until the nominations are
made."

I.yon Post "Will Remember Their Dead
Comrades as Individuals.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 26.â There has
been considerable interest manifested ac
to what part Lyon Post No. 6, G. A. R.,
now under a ninety day suspension sen
tence, would take in the approaching
Memorial day exercises in this city. The
title to the soldiers' plat is in their name,
but owing to their present situation they
can take no action as a G. A. R. post.
Several meetings have been held of the
members of the post at which the matter
has been considered, and they have now
agreed upon a course of action which they
make public in tbe following statement:
To the Membert of Lyon Post, Xo. 8 (suspended),
Lyon Relief Corpi, jVo. 6. and all ex-Union Sol
diers and Sailors: The undersigned, having
toeen duly appointed a committee to make
suitable arrangement for the observance of
Memorial day, hereby submit the following:
That, notwithstanding that our organization
is snspended by general order No. 11, which
prevents us from taking our proper place as an
organization in any street parade or G. A. E.
exercises on Memorial day, or any other day,
until the expiration of the period of suspen
sion, yet we deem it our sacred duty as mem
bers of the order to perform the services in
recognition of that day bo dear to our com
rades, in a simple and unostentatious manner
The members will therefore assemble at the
mÂ«in entrance of Mountain View Cemetery at
9:30 a. m.. May 80, aud at 10 a. m. sharp will
proceed to the Lyon Post plat in the cemetery
and there perform the simple and impressive
duty we owe to our departed comrades. Our
Relief Corps and aU ex-Union soldiers and
sailors and patriotic citizens are invited to
participate in the ceremonies, which will be
in harmony and not in conflict with exercises
to follow by other organizations.

street, Thursday and Friday, May 28 and
29, tinder the auspices of the Alameda
Woman's Exchange and Relief Society.
This society was incorporated Septem
ber, 1893. There is no capital stock and
no shares of stock, the whoie scheme
being to assist in all or any ways the de
serving poor, and by providing ways and
means for the sale and exchange of home
manufactured articles or other personal
property. None of the officers receive any
remuneration for their services.
The officers of the society are: Mrs. 8. A.
O'Neill^ president; Mrs. T. P. Winter, vice
president; Mrs. A. O. Gott, treasurer; and
Mrs. J. Rathgeb, secretary.
The coffers of the society being in a de
pleted condition and the suffering and
misery to be alleviated being on the in
crease, these ladies made a call on the
various churches in the city and they have
all responded with a hearty good will.
Every one in the city is anxious to help
forward the movement. The City Trus
tees gave the use of the council chamber
as a committee-room, the use of electric
wire and help to light the grounds.
The City Clerk, Ben F. Lamborn, has
offered to find and work the calcium lights
In connection with Friday nieM's per
formance. The Palace Hotel, San Fran r
â¢cioco, also lends the ten arc lamps to light
the grounds. William M. Rank supplies
the electricity.
The committees from the churches met
and decided to erect their own booths and
tents and decorate them, each church
using one particular flower for decorating
and vending only one class of eatables, so
that the tout ensemble may be unique,
ar d yet picturesque.
The grounds will be open each day at 11
a. m. and remain open till 4p. m. Lunch
will be served on the ground. Special at
tractions have been provided for each day.
Borne 500 tents will by to-morrow be erected at the picturesque grove of oaks at Buena Vista avenue and Walnut street in
Oakland, which has been chosen by the Seventh Day Adyentists of California as the site of their annual camp-meeting. Oakland is
one of the most important centers of the denomination ill the United States, and this meeting is expected to attract about 2000
visitors. There will be ten days sessions, commencing Thursday, and these will be participated in by prominent divines, laymen
and representatives of auxiliary bodies from the entire coast. Several notables from more distant parts are also expected. Re
ligious liberty is to be one of the leading themes of the concourse, and some very interesting papers on this important subject are
expected. Officers are also to be elected, and the State Sabbath-school Association, the State Tract and Missionary society, the
Healdsburg College, the St. Helena Sanitarium ana the Pacific Press of Oakland are all to receive consideration. Over seventy
churches, with 3,500 members, will be represented in the meeting.
On Thursday evening there will be a
monster bicycle lantern parade, in which
upward of 500 wheelmen and wheelwomen
are expected to take part. When the
parade and its followers have entered the
grounds a grand concert will be given
under the direction of Mrs. Baurhyt", and
at which all tbe national anthems of the
world will be sung by a chorus of 100 voices.
On Friday afternoon a half holiday has
been declared for the children of the
schools and special provision will be made
to entertain them. It is to be entirely a
children's afternoon.
To entice their elders on that afternoon
a junior bicycle floral parade leaving
Haight School at 2:30 o'clock has been
arranged. Every bicycle must be ridden
by children under 18 years of age. Silver
medals, Dicycle lanterns and other prizes
are to be given for the best decorated
wheel, to be awarded by a committee of
San Francisco ladies, who will occupy the
judge's stand at the corner of Oak street
and Central avenue. In tbe grounds there
will be a gigantic maypole dance in which
all of Professor Chapman's pupils are to
take part.
Then as a climax and a fitting conclu
sion to their arduous labors the evenine
attraction will consist of a representation
of Shakespeare's immortal comedy, "As
You Like It," rendered in the open air.
This will be romantic enough to suit the
most fastidious, and as the peforrmers are
no mere novices the rendition of the play
will not pall on the tastes of the critical.
The part of Rosalind will be taken by
Miss Elliot, who has already won honors
for the way she portrayed it at Sutro
Heights and Palo Alto. A host of visitors
are expected from San Francisco and Oak
land. To provide for their and other pa
trons' comforts arrangements have been
made for erecting a special sloping plat
form to contain 200 chairs, and behind
this a tier of raided seats.
Everything has beeii done to insure suc
cess, and its well-wishers now only trust
that the ladies may have their hearts'
desires. On Thursday morning at 9 o'clock
the following ladies will be on the
ground to receive eatables and provisions
for the various booths: Miss Spencer, Mrs.
Fox, Mrs. Goddard, Mrs. dishing and
Mrs. T. J. Tobin.
Mr*. Barotean's Lot.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 26.â 0n the cor
ner of Grand street and Itailroad avenue
there stands a house and fence projecting
on the avenue. It belongs to Mrs. Mary
Barotean and has long been an eyesore.
Twelve months ago a proposition was
made to the City Trustees to pay for their
removal, but they refuted to do
so, as they had no authority to spend
money in that direction. Now the matter
has been arranged by \V. H. Noy of Bay
street station. The work commenced yes
terday and the Southern Pacific Company
will foot the bill for the removal and im
provements, such as a stone sidewalk and
cement fence around Mrs. Harotean's lot.
Mrs. Barotean, on her part, as recited in
the deed, agrees to give to the Southern
Pacific Company, the right in perpetuity
to lay railway tracks past her house and
run trains thereon. The company holds
no franchise for the road from the city, its
contention being that the track is run on
its own private property.
More Electric Light Troubles.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May 26.â The electric
light troubles are never ending. This
morning the City Treasurer refused to
honor the wnrrant for $2500 ordered to be
paid last ni,:'>: by the City Trustees to A.
L. Fish. It was to be the first pavmenton
account of work done. A. L. Fish feels
wratby as the City Attorney holds he is
fully entitled to his money. He will now
commence mandamus proceedings and in
stitute a suit for damages against the
Treasurer.
A. P. Leroux Dead.
ALAMEDA.May 26.â Amedee P. Leroux,
living at 922 Central avenue, was found
dead in his bed yesterday morning when
his son went to awaken him. An autopsy
held later by Drs. Keyes and Fischer re
vealed the complete ossification of the
heart valves. For the past twenty-six years
he had tilled the position of druggist at the
French Hospital in this city. His remains
will be interred in the French Cemetery.
MOSES WILL GO EAST,
To Dsliver a Course of Lectures
at the University of
Chicago.
Fifteen Other Professors Will Also
Give Courses Daring the
Summer.
BERKELEY, Cal, May 26.â Professor
Bernard Moses, head of the department of
history at the State University, will leave
next Thursday evening for the University
of Chicago, where he has been engaged to
give a course of lectures in his specialty,
extending through a period of six weeks.
Professor Moses is one of the sixteen pro
fessors who have been called from the va
rious institutions in Ameiica and Europe
to deliver courses of lectures during the
period extending from the early part of
June to the latter part of July.
The sessions of the University of Chi
cago being continuous throughout the
year, there is necessarily a gap to be
bridged over by some one from the outside
whenever a professor or an instructor takes*
his vacation. It is to supply one of these
vacancies that Professor Moses goes East.
In an interview to-day the professor
said: "I have been called to Chicago to
fill a vacancy made by one of the professors
in the history department who is taking
his vacation. I shall be one of sixteen
who have been called for the purpose of
supplying these vacancies. Tne regular
corps of instructors, in addition to those
called from the outside, will number
seventy-?even. Among those from other
institutions with whom I shall be associ
ated during niv stay of six weeks at Chi
cago will be President E. Benjamin An
drews of Brown University, Professor
Ladd of the department of philosophy at
i'ale, Professor Mafteo Pantaloeni of the
University of Naples, and Professor Flugel
of the phvsiologjcal department at Stan
ford. As for my own work there, I shall
give two regular courses in history, each
of which will be four hours a week. The
first course will be on 'Spanish Colonial
Institutions in America' and the second
on 'The History of the Unitoi States from
1789 to 1849, with Bpecial Reference to Ter
ritorial Interests.' '
On the first topic Professor Moses has
been delivering lectures at Berkeley foi
tne past three years. Last summer he
took a trip through Mejico and Central
America for the purpose of studying the
manners and customs of the people and
their principles of economics and general
legislation.
It will be remembered that on this fa
mous exploiting tour of the Berkeley pro
fessor a sprinkling of adventure was added
to his journey by being mistaken for a de
faulting Southern California bank cashier,
and by his being placed under arrest until
the suspicion was removed.
It has recently been reported in Berke-
Jey that Professor Moses has received over
tures from the University of Chicago to go
there as the professor of history. When
asked regarding this rumor Professor
Moses did not deny its being true, but
merely said: "I have no further eneage
ment than the one to lecture at the Uui

had been made to him regarding the con
dition of parts of the Seventh Ward. Dr.
Rowell stated that he had investigated the
localities complained of, and that San
Francisco street, between Virginia and
Jones, is in a bad condition. Upon his
recommendation, resolutions of intention
were filed to at once sewer Fifth street,
from Pat;e to Virginia.
A communication from Regent Rein

ASSESSOR SIEBE ARRESTED A SECOND TIME,
Charged With Having Un-'
der- Assessed Judge Wal
lace's Property.
A aUESTION OF VALUES.
Secretary Willcutt's Opinion of
the Market -Street
System.
WORTH ONLY FIVE MILLIONS.
Not Worth More Than Four Millions
When Bonds for Seventeen and
a Half Were Issued.
There was a sensation early in the morn
ing yesterday in the preliminary examina
tion of Assessor Siebe. Secretary Willcutt
of the Market-street Railway system bad
just resumed the stand, with four big red
wood boxes of books and a pile of ledgers,
when Mr. Freidenrich announced that the
Assessor had been arrested on a warrant
issued by Judge Campbell, charging him
with perjury in having assessed Judee Wal
lace's real and personal property below its
actual cash value. The complaint had
been sworn to by J. W. Darragh, and Mr.
Siebe at that moment was engaged in get
ting bonds.
"I think that some of those proceedings
are a farce," said Mr. Clunie, "and I move
that his bonds be declared forfeited."
Judge Wallace remarked that he would
wait for Mr. Siebe, and in a few moments
that gentleman came in.
Mr. Willcutt was on the stand for the
greater part of the day, and he furnished
the second sensation by "going dead lame
on the track." In other words, he seemed
to have lost the power of speech when it
came his turn to reply to Mr. Clunie's
questions as to the property of the Market
street Railway system. He finally said
that the cash value of the system was not
more than $4,000,000 when he as a director
voted to issue bonds upon the property of
the road for $17,500,000.
Mr. Willcutt proceeded to read the reso
lution under which the different railway
systems consolidated with the Market'
street Railway Company, that corpora
tion assuming all debts and obligations of
the old companies and being vested with
the capital stock, franchises and all real
and personal property.
Freidenrich objected to the introduction
of the minutes of the consolidation on the
grounds that they were irrelevant and did
not bear upon the matter at issue, but
Judge W T allace promptly overruled the
objection and Mr. W T illcutt replied that the
officers of the Market-street Railway did
not make any investigation into the values
of the roads and their bonded indebted
ness.
"Do I understand you to say," inquired
Mr. Clunie, i'that your company accepted
a bonded indebtedness of more that:
$7,000,000 without any investigation what
ever into the values?"
Mr. Willcutt replied that no investiga
tion was made because the officers of the
company were conversant with the values
of the roads about to be taken into the
consolidation. He then proceeded to read
a statement of the earnings of the various
companies constituting the consolidation.
Among these were the Omnibus Railroad
Company, which, starting with a protit of
$55,561 01 in 1888 and $117,206 09 in 1890-91,
dwindled to $18,446 60 in 1892-93. Also
the North Beach and Mission Railway
Company, with a profit in 1887-88 of
$78,249 53, reached a loss of $1606 62 in
1890-91, of $8338 89 in 1891-92 and of
$20,092 07 in 1892-93. The Market-street
Railway Company started with a profit in
1890 of $247,281, in 1891 of $294,801, in 1892
of $394,729 and in 1893 of $155,744.
Mr. Willcutt then read a long list of
suits begun againet the company for
damages for injuries and deaths on the
Btreet railway system. Appended to most
of these was the note: "Got off the car
while in motion."
These were all the memoranda that he
had.
"Now, Mr. Willcutt," asKed Mr. Clunie,
"did you, as a director of the Market
street Railway Company, after the con
solidation, vote for the issuance of $17,500,
-000 of bonds on this road and was that
resolution adopted?"
The Assessor's attorneys objected to the
question. He contended that it was not
fair to go into the history of the railroad
company, and that the proper mode of
procedure was to introduce the assess
ment roll and to take up each piece of
property of the company assessed on the
roll and ascertain whether or not it had
been under-assessed.
Mr. Clunie explained that he wanted to
show that Mr. Willcutt was an expert as to
the value of the property of the company,
and Mr. Freidenrich admitted that the
witness knew the value of the property.
Judge Wallace remarked that the charge
against the Assessor was not that he had
made a mistake, but that he had delibe
rately violated his oath by deliberately
under-assessing the property of the corpo
ration.
The witness explained that the resolu
tion authorizing the issuance of the bonds
was adopted, and that in pursuance thereof
a meeting of stockholders was held on
June 28, 1894, at which meeting a resolu
tion was adopted confirming the action of
the board of directors and authorizing the
NEW TO-DAY.

board to take the necessary steps for the
issuing of the bonds. This issue of bonds
amounted practically to an increase of the
old indebtedness of $7,000,000 to $17,500,000.
The subsequent steps in the matter of
the bond issue were next detailed by Mr.
Willcutt at the suggestion of Mr. Clunie,
md pending this matter the court ad
journed till 2 p. M.
After recess John W. Darragh, the man
who bad caused the second arrest of the
Assessor, was called to the stand.
Darragh was put through a rigid exam
ination by Mr. Clunie as to his knowledge
of the subject-mtter of the complaint to
which he had sworn, "and also as to
whether his action had been instigated by
Martin Kejly.
When Mr. Clunie asked Darragh whether
he knew Martin Kelly Darragh did not
pretend to understand the import of the
question and he asked back, "Which Mar
tin Kelly?"
Before Mr. Clunie had'an opportunity of
informing Mr. Darragh as to the identity
of the particular Martin Kelly referred to
Lawyer A. Barnard, Martin Kelly's attor
ney, popped up from behind Mr. Clunie
and in an agitated manner objected to the
question on the ground that it was irrele
vant and simply a waste of time to inquire
which Mr. Kelly it was the witness knew.
Judge Wallace overruled the objection,
and Mr. Darragh confessed that he knew a
Martin Kelly who lived on Fremont street.
Again Lawyer Barnard objected, and
again Judge Wallace sat down on him.
Darragh went on to say that he met Mar
tin Kelly, the ex-political boss, in the
Baldwin Hotel on the evening before, but
had no conversation with him except to
say, "Good evening, Mr. Kelly." He did
not go there for the purpose of meeting
Kelly. He was simply taking a walk. He
denied that he had had any conversation
with Kelly on the subject of the contem
plated arrest of Assessor Siebe for under
assessing Judge Wallace's property.
Darrae'h finally admitted that he had
never seen the assessment roll except that
part of it or that page of it on which his
own property was listed, and that Martin
Kelly's attorney, Barnard, had prepared
the type-written complaint, which he had
signed and to which he had sworn.
Mr. Willcutt was recalled and testified
that he did not think he would give $5,
-000,000 for the Market-street Railroad sys
tem, as it stood on the first Monday in
March, 1895.
"Was it worth $5,000,000?" asked Judge
Wallace.
"I don't think it was." replied Mr. Will
cutt.
"Was it worth $4,000,000?"
"That is a matter of individual opinion,"
was the reply.
"What is it worth now?" asked Judge
Wallace.
"I object to the question," said Mr.
Friedenrich.
Judee Wallace overruled the objection
and repeated the question.
"That is simply a matter of opinion."
"Are your bonds above par?"
"Yes; slightly above par."
"Now," continued Judge Wallace, "if
the property would support a bond issue
of $17,500,000 under a deed of trust, sup
pose that only ten of those bonds are on
the market and they are all at par, would
that indicate the value of the property,
especially when the buyer of the ten
bonds knows that the other bonds will
follow?"
"If the other bonds were placed upon
the market," said Mr, Willcutt, "it would
require additional property to secure
them â but I don't think I understood
your question."
Judge Wallace repeated, "Say that ten
bonds have been put upon the market and
are above par, would" not that indicate
that the property is good eecuritv for
$17,500,000?"
"Not necessarily," replied Mr. Willcutt,
hesitatingly.
"When a financier buys one bond of an
issue of $17,500,000 does he not look to t-he
security for the other bonds that may be
placed on the market?" persisted Judge
Wallace.
"Certainly," replied Mr. Willcutt.
He replied to other questions that, after
the issuance of the $10,000,000 in bonds,
the stock sold for $40 per share. But he
explained that, while a few bonds might
bring $40, yet the market was ho sensitive
that if more bonds were put on the market
their value would fall. They are selling
to-day at $44, he explained, aud the price
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 1896.
had gone as high as $47 during the last
three months.
With reference to the cost of the road,
the witness said it was built by the Pacific
Improvement Company at a cost of
$3,000,000, including power-house, rolling
stock, etc.
Mr. Clunie returned to the question of
values, ana asked Mr. Willcutt whether
at the time he, as a director, voted for the
$17,500,000 issue be knew the cash value
of the road.
Mr. Willcutt evaded the question. He
said that it would depend upon the condi
tions.
"But," interrupted Judge Wallace, show
ing considerable surprise, "you knew what
those conditions were at that time. Now,
what in your judgment, taking into i con
sideration all the conditions, would it be
worth in cash?"
"That would depend upon the condi
tions," repeated Mr. Willcutt. "We pro
posed issuing those bonds for the purpose
of improving the road and thus making it
more valuable."
After more shuffling on the part of the
witness Judge Wallace asked, a little im
patiently:
"Was it worth $1000?"
"Yes," replied Mr. Willcutt promptly.
"Was it worth more than $1000?"
"Yes; I may venture to say that it waa
worth $4,000,000."
"When you voted for the issue of $17,
-| 000,000 of bonds you believed that the
cash value of the property which was the
security for those bonds was $4,000,000â is
that correct?" asked Mr. Glunie.
"Yes, sir; the cash value."
"Suppose somebody came along and
offered you $4,000,000 cash, would you
have sold the road for that?" asked Judge
Wallace.
â¢'That would be a matter for the consid
eration of the directors, the larger owners,
Crocker, Huntington, Stanford & C 0.," re
plied Mr. Willcutt after a long pause.
The affidavit accompanying a statement
of the company's property as returned by
E. Blackburn Ryan to the Assessor was
handed to tne witness. He recognized his
signature thereon, but did not remember
A. J. Clunie in Meditation, With Assessor Siebe Behind Him ; Secre
tary Willcutt and His Wagon-Load of Books ; Martin Kelly's Law
yer, Mr. Barnard, Who Was Sat Upon by Judge Wallace.
that he bad ever seen the statement be
fore, and he was not sure whether he had
sworn to it, although Notary Public
Ryan's seal was on it. He had no recol
lection of having signed it, although he
did not dispute the signature. Mr. Ryan
made out all the taxstatements.
E. Blackburn Ryan was the next witness.
He said tnat. he sent the slip around to
Mr. Willcutt and obtained his signature to
the affidavit. Then he called upon Mr.
Willcut and administered the oatn. The
data was prepared from the books in
Willcutt's office by a son of Mr. Willcutt.
The blanks in the Assessor's statement
were made by Miss Mary Hull, a clerk of
Mr. Ryan. He called upon the Assessor
and was informed that Mr. Siebe would
raise the assessment. He did raise it be
tween $000,000 and $700,000. Ryan had no
conversation with Siebe other than to say
that t.e thought the statement as turned
in by Ryan was a high enough valuation.
He never paid Mr. Siebe or Fred Siebe a
dollar.
Here the court adjourned .until 10
o'clock this morning.
THE COMPLAINT.
Allegations Respecting the Value
of Judsre Wallace's Property.
The following is the complaint sworn to
by J. W. Darragh after the preliminary
recital:
That on the 20th day of July, 1895, at the
City and County ol San Francisco, State of
California, the crime of perjury was commit
ted by John D. Siebe in manner and form as
follows, to wit:
That ever since and prior to the Ist day of
January, 1880, the City and County of San
Francisco has been and now is a municipal
corporation organized and existing under and
by virtue of the laws of the State of California;
that at an election regularly held at the City
and County of San Francisco on the 6th day
of November, 1894, for the election of officers
of said City and County, John D. Siebe was
elected Assessor of the said City and County
for the term of four yean from and after the
first Monday after the Ist day of January
1895, and that thereafter said John D. Siebe

pared and completed an assessment-book in
which he purported to have listed and assessed
c PTÂ°P cr ty within the City and County of
can Francisco subject to assessment and tax
ation within said City and County of San
r rHncisco for the fiscal year commencing July

value, and which purported to contain the
matters and thines required by nection 3650
of the Political Code of the State 'of California.
That on the 20th day of July. 1895, and after

SMO.OOO and over, undat all of said times it
would have been taken in payment of a just
debt due from said William T. " Wallace for said

biebe, as such Assessor, well knew the cash
v ? I?, e ,w\^ id Krsonal property to be the sum
of * 10,000 and over, and then azid theie dur

fiscal year commencing July 1, 1895, at its full
caMi value, but had knowingly, willfully and
corruptly assessed the same at but $1900,
when its full value, as he then and there well
knew, was $10,000 and over.
And that at the time of the making of said
affidavit and the taking of said oath he, John
I). Siebe, as such Assessor, had, as he then and
there well knew, knowingly, willfully and
corruptly permitted William T. Wallace to
escape a just and equal assessment upon his
said personal properly, subject to assessment
by him as such Assessor for the purposes of
taxation for the fiscal year commencing July
1, 1895, through favor shown by him as such
Assessor to William T. Wallace in his not as

Deponent further says upon information and
belief that on. at and prior to 12 o'clock meri
dian of the first Monday in March, 1895, the

after said time to and including the time of

situated in the City and uounty of San Fran

that the said real property at all of such times

more, and deponent, therefore,' alleges that the
said real property was of the value of $600,000
and more; and that at all of said times that it
would have been taken in payment of a just
debt due by the said William T. Wallace for
said amount; and that at all of said times said
John D. Siebe, as such Assessor, well knew that
the cash value of said real property to be the
sum of $600,000 and more ; and then and there
during *U of said times he, said John D. Siebe,
well knew that said real property was the
property of said William T. Wallace, that the
same was subject to assessment by nim for the
purposes of taxation for said fiscal year com
mencing July 1, 1895, and that during all
of said times the same wonld have been

and over; that, notwithstanding such knowl
edge on hie part, said John D. Siebe. as such
Assessor, knowingly, willfully and corruptly
assessed said real property upon said assess
ment-book for the purposes of taxation for the
fiscal year commencing July 1, 1895, $291,540
instead of at tne sum of $000,000 and more,
its full cash value, and that at the time of the
making of said affidavit by said John D. Siebe,
as hereinbefore set forth, said real property
was listed upon said assessment-book, and was
assessed thereon at the sum of $291,5-10 in
stead of its full cash value of $000,000 and
more, as said John D. Siebe, as such Assessor,
then and there well knew.
That at the time of the making of said affi
davit, as he then and there well knew, said
John D. Siebe had not faithfully complied with
all the duties imposed on him as such Asspsxor
under the revenue laws of the State of Cali
fornia In this: that he had willfully, know
ingly and corruptly failed and neglected to
assess the said real property of the said William
T. Wallace, situated in said City and County of
San Francisco, and subject to taxation and
assessment by him as such Assessor, within
said City and County of San Francisco, for said
fiscal year commencing July 1, 1895, at Its full
cash value; but had knowingly, willfully and
corruptly assessed the same at but the sum of
$291. 040, when its full cash value, as he then
and there well knew, wus $600,000 and more.
That at the time of making the said affidavit
and the taking of said oath, he, Jonn I>. Siebe,
as such Assessor, had, as he then and there
well knew, knowingly, willfully and corruptly
permitted 6aid William T. Wallace to escape a
just and equal assessment upon his said real
property, subject to assessment by him as such
Assessor for the purposes of taxation for the
fiscal year commencing July 1, 1895, shown
by him as such Assessor to said William T.
Wallace in his not assessing the said real prop
erty of the said William T. Wallace at its full
cash value.
Whereby he, said John D. Siebe, did then
and there, at> aforesaid, feloniously, willfully
and corruptly swear falsely and feloniously
and commit willful perjury, contrary to the
form, force and effect of the statute in such
case made and provided, and against the
peace and dignity of the people of the State of
California.
Wherefore, complainant prays that said John
D. Siebe may be arrested and dealt with ac
cording to law.
The Motive of the Arrest.
It is believed that the second arrest of
the Assessor and the bringing in of Judge
Wallace's name was done for the purpose
of preparing the ground for an appeal to
the Supreme Court should the Judge hold
Mr. Siebe to answer for perjury. It will
be urged in that contingency that Judge
Wallace is an interested party, bis own as
sessment being alleged to be in the same
condition as the railroad assessment, and
for that reason he is disqualified from sit
ting in the case.
Judge Wallace would not be interviewed
on the subject last night and denied him
self to the reporters.
COYLE AND WARSZAWIAK
Two Speakers Address the Pres
byterian Ministerial
Union.
The Oakland Divine Finds Many
Faults With Applied Chris
tianity.
Herman Warszawiak, superintendent of
the American Mission to the Jews, who is
on a preaching tour throughout the West,
attended the Presbyterian Ministerial
Union Monday morning and urged the
ministers present to take the evangeliza
tion of the Jews among the needs and
regular work of the churches.
"You cannot do anything nobler,
grander and more opportune than to aid
the Jewish work," he said. "Take this
City of 30,000 Israelites, many of them
prominent men. To my knowledge, there
is the most ungodly condition among the
Jews of this City of any in the United
States. They are littte more than infidels
and have adopted the almighty dollar for
their God. You will meet with great op
position at first, but you will have success
in the end."
The speaker stated that at the mission's
headquarters in New York he had been
requested to take back a letter from each
of the ministerial bodies he had addressed,
and he banded the secretary a letter from
the United Ministerial meeting of Wry
oming, heartily indorsing his labors in
that place.
"A motion with regard to a letter is in
order," said the president. At this point
of the proceedings Rev. Dr. Bovier said
that though they were all tingling with
enthusiasm ,to evangelize the Hebrew
race, they dad met to hear Dr. Coyle speak
and that he ought to be invited to take the
floor without delay.
This suggestion met with such favor
that Herman Warszawiak withdrew with
out his letter.
Dr. Coyle beean a paper on "Applied
Christianity," in the course of which he
expressed little sympathy for what be con
sidered newfangled notions on the subject
of religion. He said: j
"Too much stress is laid#y these people
on surroundings. 'Only improve tae
homes of the poor and give them educa
tional advantages and their uplifting will
be secured,' they say. I believe that the
whole idea that men would be better if
their surroundings are better is dangerous
to society. To teach people that the poor
creatures ol the slums Are hardly responsi
ble for their acts makes them say: 'My
misdeeds are not my fault; they lie at
the door of society.' "
In combating this view of the case Dr.
Coyle said : "All history is on our side
when we say that character does not de
pend on environment It is not true that
Edenic environment can lead men to the
heights and keep them there."
The speaker emphasized this point by
alluding to the fall and the comfortable
environment of Adam ami Eve when they
ate the apple in the Garden of Eden.
"Christ saw that there was but one way
to improve social conditions, and ttiat was
to give men new hearts. In institutes of
applied Christianity the talk is about con
ditions and not about souls."
In the discussion which closed the
meeting the sentiments expressed were all
in favor of Dr. Coyle's paper. Dr. Mac
kenzie said he would have been proud to
have written it.
Congregational Club.
The Congregational Monday Club, which
met Monday morning at the Grand
Hotel, was addressed by Dr. Lucas of
Oakland on the subject of "Prayer as an
Evangelistic Agency." The speaker said
that the churches had fallen into the habit
of depending too much on sermons and
had too much neglected prayer as a means
of errace.
The session closed with a special prayer
tervice.
