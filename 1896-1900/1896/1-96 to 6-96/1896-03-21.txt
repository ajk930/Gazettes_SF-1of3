Situation.
TRIBES IN THE SOTJDAN UNITE.
Holy War Proclaimed and All Der
vishes Asked to Fight Under the
Green Flag.
LONDON, Esq., March 20.â 1n the
House of Commons to-day Mr. Curzon,
Under Foreign Secretary, stated that the
Italian Government had eommuoicated to
the British Government that there was a
prospect that the dervisnes would make
iin attack upon Kassala and pointed out
the effect wliich such an attack would
have upon Egypt.
Mr. Morley asked if a majority of the
Egyptian Debt Commissioners were com
petent to sanction the proposed expendi
ture for the Dongola expedition.
Mr. Curzon said that the commission
controlled two funds. The largest of
these, which was derived from the conver
sion of the Esyptian debt, required the
unanimous consent of the powers to
authorize expenditure of the whole or any
part thereof; but the smaller one, a re
serve fund amounting to Â£2,500,000, he
said might be disposed of by a majority of
the commission.
During the debate on the estimates John
Morley, amid cheers from the Liberal
benches, moved to reduce the vote for the
Foreign Office in order to call attention to
recent events in Egypt.
Mr. Morley said in reply to a question
that unquestionably his motion sought a
vote of censure upon the Government, and
recalled the circumstances that he himself
had moved a similar vote in 1885 upon the
then Liberal Government in condemnation
of its policy in Egypt.
In the course of his argument Mr.
Morley admitted that the occupation of
Egypt by Great Britain had been pro
ductive of much benefit and many bless
ings to the people of that country [Con
servative cheers], but he said the long con
tinuance of that occupation had been
f raueht with great disadvantages to Great
Britain. It was an unfortunate step the
Government was taking to delay the
evacuation of Egypt and divert Egyptian
funds from the purposes of Egyptian
development and the application of the
money to England's own purpose. [Pro
testing cries of w Oh, Oh!" from the Con
servative benches.]
The new policy, he declared, would im
pose upon Egypt the duty of governing
one of the most difficult territories on the
face of the earth. The Government, Mr.
Morley said, had not explained their
policy, and the Ministers had declined to
treat the House with tnat confidence that
the House had reason to expect on the eve
of so great an undertaking. So hazardous
a proposal, he held, could never be justi
fied by a reason so meager, flimsy, ir
relevant and hollow as the one advanced.
Mr. Morley'a remarks were received with
prolonged Liberal cheers.
Mr. Chamberlain, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, said it would be impossible
for the opposition to pass judgment upon
the policy of the Government unlens the
Government first made up their n.inds
definitely in regard to the immediate
evacuation of Egypt. Nothing in recent
history, be said, could be looked back to
with more pride and satisfaction than the
peaceful revolving of Egyptian affairs,
which had been accomplished with a hand
ful of mcD and a British civil administra
tion. If Kgypt should be abandoned all
this would be undone.
Egypt must be defended if her prosper
ity was to continue. Toe consent of a
majority of the powers had already been
given to England's plan of meeting the
expenses, and the Government had no
knowledge leading them to assume that
the consent of the remaining powers would
be finally refused. If the result of tde
British expedition should in a measure re
lieve Egypt from the constant menace ot
attacks by the dervishes, the expenditures
incurred would be more than compensated
for. It would be impossible to fulfill
England's duty to the people as long as
the dervishes were permitted to threaten
peaceful industry by their constant raids.
The defeat of the Italians in Abyssinia
had created a new situation. If Kassala
should fall the evil effect upon Egypt
would be incalculable. The various tribes
of the Soudan were putting aside their
internecine disputes and combining in a
great effort against Egypt. The wisest
policy was to anticipate their attack and
prevent the dervishes from concentrating
against one object.
Whatever the Egyptian advance might
ultimately t>e, he said, it would only be
limited by the nature and extent of the
resistance encountered and the mainten
ance of the security of the communities.
Henry Labouchere said the Government
should " wait before taking action until
Egypt is att sicked by tne dervishes. The
reluctance on the part of the Ministers to
disclose their plans, he declared, concealed
a large scheme. Mr. Labouchere predicted
that the expedition, unless checked by dis
aster, would go to Dongola and Khartoum
and Darfur.
Henry M. Stanley, the explorer, who
represents the north division of Lambeth
in the interest of the Liberal-Unionists,
assorted that Egypt had a right to reclaim
her former frontiers and that the oppor
tunity for doing so had come. The total
defeat of the Mahdists., Mr. Stanley de
clarer., must precede the independence of
E-rvpt.
Mr. Curzon said that the expedition
would take a strongly defensive position
The San Francisco Call.
at Akasheh, where it would remain until
the hot season, when, if it was thought
desirable, it would proceed to Dongola.
The Government, he added, possessed
proofs that there was a general ferment
among the dervishes and that they were
threatening Kassaia and the Nile Valley.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt. the oppo
sition leader in the House, said the Gov
ernment was entering upon a long, dan
gerous and uncertain enterprise. It would
not state the true object or define the real
limits, of the expedition. He believed it
would be condemned by tbe people.
The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, First
Lord of the Treasury and Government
leader in the House, said there was noth
ing in the expedition to excite suspicion
or alarm in France. The operations had
no relation to the British occupation of
Egypt. The position of Egypt could not
be saf.sfactory until that country regained
control of a large part of the Soudan.
Everything gained for Egypt would be
gained forever. It would not be an ad
vance followed by a retreat. He was con
vinced that in the interetts of Egypt and
of Egypt alone the Government waa well
advised in initiating this policy.
A vote was then taken on Morley's mo
tion and it was defeatedâ 2BÃ to 145.
BOLT WAR IS ItECI.A.REb.
The Khalifa Calls the Oerrinheg to Enroll

LONDON, Eng., March 20.-A dispatch
from the Cairo Giobe says: The Khalifa has
proclaimed a holy war against Egypt,
calling upon all the Dervishes capable of
bearing arms to enroll themselves under
the green banner. It is asserted that Os
man Digna had quit Kasala to join the
Dervish forces around Dongola.
The Daily News will to-morrow publish
a dispatch from Cairo saying that Colonel
Hunter has occupied Akasheh, south of
Wady^Halfa, without opposition. He will
probably push on to Suardeh, where the
dervishes have their northern outposts.
REPULSEI* WITH LOSSES.
Dervishes Make Unsuccessful Attacks on

MASSOWAH, Abyssixia, March 20.â
On tie 18th inst. a force of dervishes made
four attacks on the Italians in the Sabderat
denies, near Kassala. They were repulsed
each time with losses.

lietnanded the Recall of the Italian
Troops From Africa.
HOME, Italy, March 20.â Durine the
discussion to - day by the Chamber of
Deputies of the credits asked for by the
Government, Signor Paolo Taroni, Radi
cal member for Lugo, demanded the recall
of the Italian troops from Africa. He held
that the military party, the court and the
King, were answerable for Italy's fatal
colonial policy.
Signor Taroni was repeatedly called to
order and his arraignment of the Govern
ment was greeted with shouts of '-Enough !
sit down!" The hubbub finally became
so great that the sitting âas suspended for
a time.
Upon the resnmption of the sitting
Sigaor Sonnino, formerly Minister of the
Treasury, denied a statement that had
been made that the followers of ex-Prime
Minister Crispi desired to raise a question
of confidence In the Government. He ap
pealed to all the members of tne House to
vote the credits.
A dispatch to the Tribuna from Masso
wah states that General Baldissera, the
Italian commander in Africa, has sent two
battalions of infantry and a battaJion of
artillery to Keren to operate against the
Mahdists.
MUST SHARE THE TRAFFIC.
Managers of the Transcontinental Railways to
Renew an Agreement With the
Pacific Mail.
NEW YOKK, K. V., March 20. â The
traffic managers of the transcontinental
railways have been meeting at the Wind
sor Hotel for three days and have nearly
completed arrangements for the reorgani
zation of the Transcontinental Traliic As
sociation. It is expected that the associa
tion will go into operation by April 1.
Every line will be bound to continue a
member until January 1, 1897, but after
that date any line may withdraw on ninety
days' notice. It is proposed to restore the
old allowance of $72,500 a month by the
railroads to the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company.
For this sum the Pacific Mail Company
will give up to tbe railroads room on each
ship it sends out from San Francisco for
600 tons of freight consigned to New York.
Under its contract the Pacific Mail Com
pany the Panama Railroad will receive
for itself and its steamship line between
Colon and New York 65 per cent of the al
lowance by the railroads to the Pacific
Mail Company. The traffic manaeers will
try to complete their work to-morrow, but
it is doubtful if they can do so. One re
sult, of the ntw arrangements will bo an
advance in rates.
Jteopen a Aoterf Case.
BUTTE, Mont., March 20. -Elizabeth S.
Bowdoin of Springfield, Mass., sister of
Andrew J. Davis, to-day instituted a new
contest in the famous Davis will case by
tiling a petition to revoke the probate of
the will which was admitted to probate
about a year ago. She sets up a charge
that the will was a forgery, and if genuine
had been expressly revoked by a subse
quent will, which was afterward destroyed
by Davis. The petition will reopen the
entire case.

ment in the Venezuelan
Boundary Dispute.
NORTHCOTE TO PARTICIPATE.
Great Secrecy Maintained as to the
Concessions Made by Inter
ested Parties.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 20.â
Senor Andrade, the Venezuelan Minister,
continues uninformed as to the progress
of negotiations so vital to his own coun
try in the boundary dispute, but since
President Cleveland's message to Congress
resulting in the hijrh commission Vene
zuela is no longer inquisitive as to the
means pursued by the United States to
settle the matter, relying with confidence
upon the good intentions of the United
States.
Simultaneously with the admission in
the House of Commons on Monday last by
Mr. Curzon, Parliamentary Secretary of
the Foreign Office, that negotiations had
been resumed, which probably had
reference to the preliminary discus
sions by Embassador Bayard and Lord
Salisbury, full instructions were sent the
British Embassador here, which are un
derstood to be of such scope as to give him
plenipotentiary powers to reach an agree
ment with Secretary Olney.
Littie doubt is exrressed that Sir Henry
Stafford Northcote, who reached here Sun
day, will also be an active participant in
the negotiations, to which under ordinary
circumstauceÃ the Venezuelan representa
tive would not be invited until considera
ble advance had been made. Beyond the
fact that negotiations are actually going
on, which is now admitted by all the par
ties concerned, the strictest secrecy is
maintained as to any concession made by
either of the interested parties.
Taxes line in JSrrada.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20. â
Wneeler H. Peckharn of New York av
peared to-day in the Supreme Court of the
United States as counsel for the Central
Pacific Railroad Company in the litiga
tion with the State of Nevada over the
attempt to collect taxes from the railroad
corporations for 1888, upon certain tracts
of land within the United States grant
made to the railroad. The District Court
for Nevada held that fie State was en
titled to recover taxes upon lands patented
and unpatented that had been surveyed,
but not entitled to taxes upon unsurveyed
lands.
Mr. Peckham contended that the judg
ments should be reversed, with instruc
tions to t tie court below that only patented
lands can be taxed, or at least that only
patented lands and surveyed lands oh
which the fees have been paid can be as
sessed and taxed under the existing tax
law of Nevada.

WICHITA, Kans., March 20.â Fred
Harris, alias "Texas Jake," leader of a
band of outlaws having their rendezvous
in No Mans Land, Oklahoma, stopped at
the ranch of Peter Means, near Hugoton,
Kans., yesterday, and finding Rosa, the
ranchor's daughter, there alone, attempted
to assault her. Her cries brought help,
and Harris hurriedly mounted a fleet
horse and fled toward the Territory.
Tne cowboys gave chase, overtaking him
late last night near the State line. He
made ;i desperate resistance, and not until
shot through the thigh and left leg was he
overpowered. He was strung up to the

CAPTURED BY THE SPANISH.
Rifles and Ammunition Taken From the
Struggling Cuban*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20.âMin
ister Dupuy de Lome received the follow
ing telegram from the Captain-General of
Cuba tr."B morning:
HAVANA, CUBA, March 20.â The detach
ment of Varadero, near Cardenas, captured
150 boxes of ammunition four Remington and
WinchesterJiflp', nine boxes of cavalry rifles,
fourteen tin- boxes of medicines, twenty knap
sacks covered with oilcloth and two boxes of
explosives and three boats. Wkyi.er.
Minister de Lome has no doubt that all
this material was that landed by the
Collazo expedition from Cedar Key in the
schooner J. S. Mallory, captured by the
United States revenue cutters, released by
the customs authorities at Tampa and
afterward trans-shipped near the southern
coast of Florida to the steamer Three
Friends.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 20.â
From information received here to-day the
seizure of arms and ammunition Wednes
day by the Spanish in Cuba is not so im
portant as the official dispatches from
Havana would indicate. The munitions
seized were not those taken out in the
Mallory, but were from the schooner
Arkell. The Arkell was at anchor at a
place called El Verarado. All the arms
aboard her had been landed save 145 cases
of ammunition when the gunboat Caradad
hove in sight. The men on the Arkell
abandoned the schooner and hastily
escaped to the shore. The Caradad seized
the Arkell and 145 cases of ammunition.
STEEL STEAMER FOR CUBA.
The Teasel Will /;Â«- Heady When Bellig-

NEW YORK, N. V., March 20.â A Re
corder special from Philadelphia says:
Captain W. \V. Ker, Assistant District
Attorney and part owner of the Hart line
of steamers, which have frequently been
used for filibustering purposes by the
Cuban junta, yesterday exhibited a large
picture of a new steel steamship, armed
with improved naval guns and otherwise
equipped as a cruiser, capable of giving
battle to any warship in the Spanish navy.
Mr. Ker would not give the name of the
vessel, her tonnage, nor any particulars
about her. Besides her steam power she
has an auxiliary rigging for canvas, and
shows seven or eight evil-looking guns.
Mr. Ker said :
"Just as 2non as Congress recognizes
Cuban belligerency you will hear from
this ship. As you can see, she is built for
the fruit trade, and will carry 250 fighting
men. There might be such arms aboard
as machetes, pistoJs and rifles that could
be used in an emergency. You will also
hear from the Bermuda in a few days, and
I would not be surprised if she landed in
Cuba during broad daylight."

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20.â A
dispatch to the State Department to-day
from Consul-Genernl Williams a*. Havana
reported that he had investigated the arrest
and imprisonment of Oliverio Agramonte,
an alleged American citizen, charged with
complicity in the insurrection, and had
ascertained that Agramunte "was a Spanish
subject.
Tnis disposes of the case so far as the in

York yesterday by a passenger of the
steamer Scutb Cambria about an alleged
attempt on Mr. Hall's life by a Spanish
soldier on March 4is erroneous. Mr. Hall
says he has no reason to believe that the
bullet tired was intended for him. On the

President Cleveland will early next week

Americans already aggregates $30,000,000,
and that the Spaniards and Cubans are
about equally guilty. As long, however,
as the war is recognized as an insurrec

Disastrous Result of an Attempt
to Reach the Beach in a
Longboat.
HEROIC WORK OF LIFESAVERS.
Twenty-Six Men Rescued by the Fort
Canby Crewâ The Vessel Going
to Pieces.
PORTLAND, Or., March 20.â The thun
dering surges of the north weather
beach are beating to pieces another gal
lant ship, and in the treacherous under
tow are drifting two of the vessel's crew,
drowned in the attempt to reach the shore.
Shortly after noon yesterday a heavy fog
settled down off the mouth of the Colum
bia River, completely obscuring the sea
from the observer at Fort Canby. There
was little likelihood of any of the few ships
due putting in an appearance in the offing
with such heavy weather prevailing, and
it was therefore a startling sound when at
3:15 p. m. the boom of a gun fired from a
ship in distress came echoing against the
cliff of Cape Disappointment.
The signal was from the British ship
Glenmorag, Captain Currie, from Callao,
seeking a charter. Enveloped in the fog
bank far out to sea, Captain Currie had
lost his bearings, and, drifting along, un
knowing of the heavy easterly set of the
cuirent, the master of the Glenmorag had
awakened to his danger only on hearing
the cry of the lookout, "Breakers ahead!"
followed by the booming of the seas roll
ing on the yet distant beach.
Hurriedly the starboard anchor was cock
billed and got over the side. As the ship
paid off to the scope of the anchor-chain
and swung head on a rolling, unbroken
mountain of water lifted under her forefoot,
and before more scope could be given the
starboard anchor cleared the bottom, the
Glenmorag drifting into the second line of
rollers.
Ihe port anchor had by this time been
raised and was let go. bat never for a mo
men' was the ground tackle given a chance
to fi ke bold at the bottom. No sooner
would one cable tauten and the work of
gettinp the ship riding to both anchors be
got under way than a great roller would
throw the bow of the ship high into the air.
Before the anchors could again take hold
the vessel had taken a heavy drift inshore
At 3:50 o'clock the Gienmorag met the
first line of breakers, the sea coming over
the topgallant forecastle, setting the waist
awash. A moment later she struck lightly,
but without apparent damage, a lull be
tween the breakers allowing the storm
ports and scuppers tt> clear the decks of
water. Captain Currie took advantage of
the slight pause between seas to fire an
other gun, which was answered frÂ«Mn shore
by the people of Ocean Park who, follow
ing the first signal of distress, had flocked
down to the beach.
Two successive breakers after the first
touch of land the Glenmorag rode. Then
came a towering, green mass of water,
which, breaking fair at the knighthead of
the doomed vessel, buried her inasmotrier
of foam, at the same time throwing her
inshore. Wallowing in the trough of the
sea the ship was lifted on the crest of the
next breaker and cast broadside onto the
sands.
This was at 4 o'clock. The seas were
making steady breaches over the ship. Cap
tain Currie although not able to mate out
the shore through the dense fog knew it
was close at hand, it being possible during
lulls to hear the shouts of the people on
the beach. He decided to attempt the

launching of|the longboat and the getting
of a line ashore. The port-quarter boat,
with six men and the second officer, was
swung out on the davits and watching the
opportunity the falls were cast off.
The boat never cleared the ship's side.
There was a moment's struggle as the
men strained at the oars, and then the
next breaker, sweeping around the stern,
sent boat and men crashing in a heap
against the Glenmorag's quarter. Four of
the crew and the second mate by super
human effort were rescued and brought
back on deck, bruised and bleeding. The
other two able seamen, James Adams and
"Wiliiam Readdie, were crushed between
the boat and ship and drowned.
The splendid work of the Fort Canby
life-savers, who had arrived on the scene,
resulted in the saving of twenty-six souls
left on board the ship after the disastrous
boat-launching. Tiiese are being cared for
at Ocean Park and Uwaco.
The Glenmorag is an iron ship built in
1Â£76 at Glasgow by Dobbie & Co. for R. &
C. Allen. She is of 1576 tons net register,
her dimensions being: length, 255.1 feet;
beam, 35.6 feet; depth, 22.8 feet. She was
evidently bound for this port, seeking a
charter, she not being listed ana shipping
men knowing nothing of her intended ar
rival nor of her departure from Callao in
ballast. The vessel will prove a total loss.

ASTORIA, Or., March 20.â The British
ship Glenrnorag, which went ashore on the
Washington coast a few miles south of the
entrance of Shoalwater Bay yesterday
afternoon, was high on the hard sand
beach at low tide to-day. Her master,
Captain Alexander Currie, says that he

had a fair passage up the coast. Foi the ,
past few days fog prevented the taking of i
observations. Captain Currie thought he {
was about off the mouth of the Columbia
and well outside, and was waiting to pick
up a pilot when the lookout called out, !
"Breakers ahead !" Before a sheet could >
be let go she ran hard on the sand.
Ignorant of where he was, and thinking
it was near Tillamook, fifty miles away,
both anchors were dropped and the boats
ordered manned. It was broad daylight, j
but the fog was so ihicfc that one could j
not see a cable's lengtn. The wind was ;
blowing from the south and the surf ran j
strong with the tide. The first boat low
ered was in a trough of the sea on the
wrong side; the waves smashed it against j
the side of the ship. James Adams, a sea- j
man, had a rowlock driven into his head j
and was killed; William Readdie's skull i
â was crushed between the boat and the side
of the ship, and four others were badly in
jured, one's leg being broken. These are
expected to live, although badly injured.
The balance, with the dead and injured,
landed safely in other boats.
While the general opinion is that the
Glenmorag will be a total loss, Captain
Currie claims that she can be got off,
and the tug Relief will go from here in the
morning to attempt to rescue the ship.
ACQUITTED AT MODESTO
"White-Hat" McCarty Found Not
Guilty of Neglecting His
Horses.
The TurfmaD Believes Rancher Canty
Should Be Prosecuted for
Cruelty.
MODESTO, Cal., March 20.â 1t took a
jury of nine raÂ«n just six minutes to de
cide that "White-Hat" McCarty and his
Bon, Joseph, were not guilty of the crimi
nal charge brought against themâ that of
failing to provide the necessary suste
nance to a band of 294 fine-bred horses
pastured at J. M. Canty 's ranch. Mc-
Carty and Canty were the only witnesses
put on the stand, and the case was sub
mitted without argument. McCarty
brought W. W. Mendenball of San Fran
cisco, and Ed Richards, but they did not
testify.
The case began at 2:30 o'clock this after
noon, ending at 6:20. The jury took but
one ballot. The principal point contested
was: Did Canty contract to feed the
horses fora compensation of $125 a montn,
and was the said contract annulled by
McCarty in anyway?
The jury consisted of these farmers and
business men: J. B. Brown, W. S. Stone,
Samuel Gates, W. H. Bortle, C. D. Vezey,
H. C. Short, C. H. Abbott, J. A. Lewis and

MR. BAYARD
IS CALLED DOWN
Adoption by the House of
the Resolutions of
Censure.
JOINED BY DEMOCRATS.
Six Voted With Republicans in
Teaching a Lesson to the
Talkative Diplomat.
VEEY POOR DEFENSE IS MADE.
Boatner's Seat Declared Vacant by
Reason of Fraud in the
Election.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20. -The
House immediately after the reading of
the [journal proceeded to consider the
resolutions censuring Mr. Bayard, Embas-
sador to London, for his speeches at Boston
and Edinburgh. A.dams(R.) of Pennsyl
vania recommended the passage of the
resolutions. He paid a high tribute to
the personal character of Mr. Bayard, but
questioned the propriety of the Embassa
dor of the United States going down to the
little town of Boston, Eng., and presenting
prizes to the clever youths of the grammar
school there. Mr. Bayard's acquaintance
with the proper conduct of public affairs
was obtained by a career of thirty years
therein. Adams said, and he was justified
in committee and in the House in support
ing the resolution of censure.
Fairchild (R.) of New York, supporting
the resolutions, fonnd fault with them for
not going far enough, and asserted that if
the House could have considered the
question apart from partisanship it would
now be discussing articles of impeachment
instead of a mere resolution of censure.
Wheeler (D.) of Alabama, said the at
tack upon Mr. Bayard came from the
State of Massachusetts, which believed in
protection for protection's sake. He had
the clerk read from the Cleveland World,
edited by Robert P. Porter, the "King and
Prince of Protection," a telegram from
Younetown, Ohio, announcing the ship
ment*^ a large invoice of finished iron to
India.
"That." exclaimed Wheeler, "is the
tribute to the Wilson tariff bill, which
opened the markets of the world to the
products of the United States."
Hutcheson (D.) of Texas, considered
Mr. Bayard's words as "ill-timed and un
warranted."
Willis (R.) of Delaware, whose con
stituent Mr. Bayard is, could not give his
consent to the passage of the first resolu
tion, standing with Draper (R.) of Mass
achusetts. He would move an amend
ment to the second resolution, declaring
the sense of the House to be that diplo
matic officers should not make partisan
speeches by adding the words, "nor speak
in disparagement of American people."
His first reason for opposing the resolu
tion of censure, Willis said, was a matter
of State pride. Willis was heard with
great interest, and closed with an appeal
not to pass the resolution of censure.
In the course of his remarks Willis oaid :
"There are men holding subordinate
places in the Government of the United
States to-dayâ men sitting with their feet
on the mantel-piece, with a cigar in their
mouthsâ ,who are as difficult of access as
the Mikado of Japan. [Laughter.] They
have got the big head and got it bad.
They belong probably to the class that be
lieve everything foreign is good. They
belong to that large class who think that
everything that comes from abroad is bet
ter than anything that is American ; they
ape foreign manners and adopt foreign
institutions, and cultivate foreign style
and foreign fashions, and leave here
every vacation time and go to Eu
rope to apologize for the Battle of
Bunker Hill. [Laughter and ap
plause.] These are the people who are
glad to be welcomed at the feet of royalty
and believe in it, and would be proud to
eat dirt if they could eat it off a royal
platter; the people who think that an
aristocratic, broken down snob, a gouty,
leprous, half-idiotic, licentious lord is
better than an honest American citizen ;
that this degenerate offspring of spnriou9
ancestors, the rotten product of a rotten
airti effete system, is better than the sun
burnt American farmer with his bronzed
cheeks, painted with pigments of the sky,
his nerves and muscles as strong as those
of Hercules, his every sinew hardened
with honest toil, his biuod as pure as the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1896.
waters of Castalia, with feet as winged as
Mercury's as he goes to his -morning toil,
brushing the dew off the grass by the
hedgerows, filled with the ozone of God
and feeling himself a man. [Applause.]
"In my judgment, Mr. Speaker, there is
but one standard by which the difference
can be marked in the social standing of
the human family, and 1 wish to draw
that standard here, before the young men
of this House, who, I trust, will be in it,
its pride and glory, perhaps long years
after many of us who are older have gone
to the other land. There is just one stand
ard of distinction, appropriately speak
ing, between men in this world, and that
is greater knowledge and better morals.
[Applause.] To know more and do better;
everything else is subordinate to that. I
do not care to go beyond that. Old Mat
Pryor's epitaph was good enough for me.
His epitaph was :
"Here lies Mat Vryor,
Descended from Adam afld Eve;
If any one can rank higher,
I'se willing to give him leave."
[Applause.]
Turner (D.) of Georgia made a strong
speech defending the Embassador from the
charges made against him and affirming
that he was right in saying what he did.
Newlands (Silver) of Nevada, speaking
in favor of the resolution, said the strength
of President Cleveland eulogized by Mr.
Bayard was the strength of destruction,
not of construction.
The last speech was made by Bailey (D.}
of Texas, who spoke particularly of the
Boston speech. Mr. Jiayard's utterance
that the people of the United States were a
violent people who frequently needed to
have their way obstructed was not only
in violation of diplomatic etiquette, but an
offense against good sense and sound and
rugged patriotism. [Applause.]
"Whoever teaches," said JBailey in con
clusion, "that the will of the people should
be frequently or at all obstructed assails
the foundation of the Government, and
whoever says the people are turbulent is
unworthy to represent the Government
anywhere in any capacity." [Extended
applause.]
The vote on the resolutions was then
taken, first on the resolution censuring
Mr. Bayard for his utterances, a separation
of the two being asked by Draper (R.) of
Massachusetts and Willis (R.) of Dela
ware. The rollcall resulted: Ayes 180,
noes 71.
The vote was mainly along political
lines, the Republicans voting aye and the
Democrats no. The Populists supported
the resolutions.
Willis (R.) of Delaware endeavored to
secure unanimous consent to amend the
second resolution by adding the words
"or which reflects upon the American peo
ple," but Pearson (R.) of North Carolina
objected. The vote was then taken on this
resolution, also by aye 3 and noes. The roll
call resulted: Ayes 191, noes 59.
There were no Republican or Populist
votes cast against this resolution, and the
following Democrats voted for it: Allen
of Mississippi, Bailey of Texas, Cummings,
Hutcheson, Layton, Owens of Kentucky,
Pendleton of Texas, Sorg and Stokes of
South Carolina.
The resolutions as agreed to are as fol
lows:
Whereas, Thomas F. Bayard, Embassador of
the United States to Great Britain, said in a
public speech delivered in Boston, England,
August 2, 1895. as follows: "He (the President
of the United States) stands in the midst of a
strong, self-confident and oftentimes violent
people â men who seek to have their own way,
and who need to have that way frequently
obstructedâ and I tell you plainly that it takes
a real man to govern the people of the United
States"; and, whereas, Thomas F. Bayard, Em
bassador of the United States to Great Britain,
said in a public speech delivered in Edin
burgh, Scotland, on November 7. 1895, as fol
lows: "In my own country I have witnessed
the insatiable growth of that form of state
socialism styled 'protection,' which I believe
has done more to foster class legislation and
create inequality of fortune, to corrupt
public life, to banish men of independent
mind and character from the public councils,
to lower the tone of National representation,
blunt public conscience, create false standards
in the popular mind, divorce ethics from poli
tics and place politics upon the low level of a
mercenary scramble than any other single
cause. â¢ â¢ â¢ It (the said policy of protection)
has unhesitatingly allied itself with every
policy which tends to commercial isolation,
dangerously depletes the treasury and saps
the popular conscience by Echemes of corrupt
ing favor and largesse to special classes, whose
support is thereby attracted. Thus it has done
so much to throw legislation into the political
market, where jobbers and chaffers take the
place of statesmen" ; therefore be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Honse of
Representatives that Thomas F. Bayard, Em
bassador of the United States to Great Britain,
in publicly using the language above quoted
has committed an offense against diplomatic
propriety and an abuse of the privileges of his
exalted position which should make him the
representative of the whole country and not
of any political party. Buch utterances are
wholly inconsistent with that prudent, deli
cate and scrupulous reserve which he himself,
while Secretary of State, enjoined upon all
diplomatic agents of the United States. In
one speech he affronts the great body of his
countrymen who believe in the policy of pro
tection: in the other speech he offends
all his countrymen who believe that Ameri
cans are capable of self-government. There
fore as the immediate representatives of the
American people and in their name we con
demn and censure the said utterances of
Thomas F. Bayard.
Resolved, further, That in the opinion of the
House oi -Representatives public speeches by
our diplomatic or consular officers abroad
which display partisanship or which condemn
any political party or party policy or organiza
tion of citizens in the United States are in
dereliction o| the duty of such officers, impair
their usefulness as public servants' and
diminish : the confidence which they should
and may command at home and abroad.
The contested election case of Alexis
Benoil vs. Charles Boatner, from the Fifth
Louisiana District, was called up by John
son (R.) of Indiana, chairman of the Com
mittee on Resolutions 2, who moved
the adoption of ti.e resolution adopted by
the committee dec'aring the seat vacant
and that an invalid election was held.
Bailey (D.) of Texas moved as a substi
tute the resolution recommended by the
minority that Boatner was entitled to hold
his seat.
It was explained that at the suggestion
of the contestee, Boatner, it had been
agreed to submit the case to the House for
decision to-day without argument. The
reason for this was that in case the House
should concur in the report of the com
mittee and unseat Boatner to-morrow was
the last day on which the Governor of
Louisiana could give notice of a new elec
tion in the district to be held at the gen
eral election of the State on April 21.
Taylor (R.) of Ohio read from the report
of the committee, which substantially
cnarges that the election in question was
permeated with fraud, violence and intimi
dation, and the committee had adopted a
resolution declaring, therefore, the seat in
Congress from the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict of Louisiana to be vacant.
Boatner presented to the liouse portions
of the report of the minority, after which
Benoit, the contestant, was accorded the
privilege of the floor for ten minutes. In
that time he briefly sketched the condition
of things in the district, asserting that the
negroes were either prevented from voting
at all or compelled to vote the Democratic
ticket.
The resolution of the minority was re
jectedâayes 59, noes 131-* and then, with
out a division, the resolution of the ma
jority declaring the seat vacant was agreed
to.
At 5 o'clock the House took a recess
under the rules until 8 o'clock, for regular
Friday night session for pension bills,
after which it will adjourn until Monday.
At the evening session no question of a
quorum was made upon the motion to go
into committee of the whole and several
bills were ordered to be reported favorably
to the House. Among them was one
granting a pension of $100 a month to Jo
seph A. Cook, a brevet major-general in
the War of the Rebellion. He was a vet
eran of the Mexican War and as such has
been drawing a pension of $8 a month.
More recently he has been in receipt of a
pension of $12 a month under the general
law of 1890.
In the course of the evening Loud (R.)
of California antagonized a bill to pension
the widow of Captain Crandall, for some
years an employe of the Senate, and in
connection with his remarks read a pro
test from Sedgwick Post, G. A. R., of San
Francisco, against the granting of large
pensions to widows of deceased officers.
He said he was surprised that the old sol
diers had not risen in rebellion against the
action of Congress in regard to some of
these cases. [Applause.]
Blue (R.) of Kansas also warned the
House that the old soldiers were watching
them and would intelligently make up
their minds whether or not they acted
with equity in the cases brought to their
attention in these Friday night sessions.
At 10:30 o'clock the House adjourned
until Monday.
AX UXGEXEItOVS VANTAGE.
The English Would Regret the Departure
of Bayard.
LONDON, Hxg., March 20.â The Stand
ard, commenting on the action of the
House of Representatives in adopting the
resolutions censuring Embassador Bayard,
will to-morrow say that while there is
some reason for the complaint against Mr.
Bayara it thinks his opponents ridiculovs
to exaggerate the grievance. They have
taken an ungenerous advantage.
The Standard will say it is of the opin
ion that a strong motive to induce Mr.
Bayard to ignore the yote of censure and
to remain at his post is found in the fact
that the friendly tone which succeeded the
initial bitterness of the Venezuelan ques
tion was largely due to his personal exer
tions. Englishmen, the paper says, would
genuinely regret his departure.
GARMENT-WORKERS WIN
Six Hundred Who Went on
Strike Return to Work
at Chicago:
But the Condition of the Cutters Is
Not Changed by the Surrender
of Contractors.
CHICAGO, 111., March 20.â Six hun
dred garment-workers who went on strike
returned to their machines to-day, receiv
ing an advance of 25 per cent in wages, a
weekly payday, recognition of the union
and a bond of $200 to bind the bosses to
live up to their agreement.
Fifty of the tailor contractors called at
the garment-workers' headquarters yes
terday and to-day and signed the contract,
but permission was not given for the
workers to return to the shops until the
bond had been given. The contractors
were compelled to yield to the garment
workers' terms because the owners of the
custom tailor establishments demanded
that orders be filled.
The practical surrender of the contract
ors has not changed the condition of the
cutters' strike. The garment-workers who
went out to help them win are helping
themselves.

CANNES, France, March 20.â 1n the
Cannes regatta to-day tne cup given by-
James Gordon Bennett and Ogden Goelet
was contested for, this being the second
event for that trophy since it was do

declared off, as only two yachts appeared
at the starting line, while the conditions
required three. Three vessels started to
day, bat, as last year, only under differ
ent circumstances, there was no result.
The Ailsa, Britannia and Satanita got
off malightwini and became becalmed
under the lee of the Esterel Mountains and
were unable to finish the course before

during the whole of the first and part of
the second round, but the Ailsa afterward
took the lead and maintained a position

boat until the time limit had expired.
The race will probably be resailed next

THE RESOLUTION GOES OVER.
Morgan, However, Introduces a
Second Measure to Recognize
Belligerency.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20.â The
debate on the Cuban question occupied
most of the time of the Senate to-day. It
was. opened by Caffery of Louisiana in
continuation of the speech begun by him
yesterday in earnest opposition to ail in
terference in the matter, and it was closed
by an equally earnest appeal by Call of
Florida in favor of the Cuban insurgents
or patriots.
There was a rather unfavorable indica
tion of the fate of the conference report in
a vote taken on the question of an adjourn
ment over. A motion that when the Sen
ate adjourn to-day it will be till Monday
next was made early in the day by Gorman
of Maryland. It was resisted by Senators
Sherman of Ohio and Lodge of Massa
chusetts on the ground that the Cuban
resolutions should be pressed to a vote
without unnecessary delay. The motion
to adjourn over was carried, however, by a
large majorityâ 42 to 22.
There was no time lost in getting at the
conference report on the Cuban resolutions
this morning. , The reading of yesterday's
journal was dispensed with and there was
little or no morning business to be dis
posed of.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio moved that the
conference report be taken up; but as soon
as that motion \vas agreed to and the re
port laid before the Senate Allen (Pop.) of
Nebraska requested that he might address
the Senate for half an hour on the Dupont
election case.
Sherman yielded gracefully and Allen
addressed the Senate.in opposition to the
claim of JJupont to a seat in the Senate
from the State of Delaware. He wound
up his speech by declaring emphatically
that he would vote against Dupont being
recognized as a Senator.
A motion to adjourn over until Monday
was made by Gorman (D.) of Maryland
ana was, in the absence of Sherman, ob
jected to by Lodge (R.) of Massachusetts,
who desired to have action on the Cuban
resolutions.
A call of the Senate was had in order to
give time for Sherman to return to the
chamber, and sixty Senators responded.
In the meantime Sherman returned, and
he expressed the hope that the motion to
adjourn over would not be agreed to un
less there was first an agreement reached
as to a time for taking a vote on the Cuban
resolutions.
To that proposition a strong objection
was made by Hale (R.) of Maine, on the
ground that two-thirds of the time con
sumed in the Cuban discussion had been
occupied by the members of the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations or those who
sympathized with their report, and that
there were many Senators who desired to
be heard on the other side of the question.
The vote was taken on Gorman's motion
and it was agreed toâ ayes 42, noes 22.
Mitchell (R.) of Oregon, chairman of
the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions, reported the joint resolution for the
election of United States Senators by the
people and gave notice that as soon as pos
sible he would move to have it taken up
and considered.
"As one of the minority of the commit
tee," Chandler said, "I give notice that the
motion of the Senator from Oregon will
be vigorously opposed."
The conference report on the Cuban res
olutions was then taken up and Caffery
(D.) of Louisiana continued the speech be
gun by him yesterday in opposition to the
report. He said that the exercise of the
power of recognizing belligerent rights was
exclusively in the executive branch of the
Government. He went on to argue that
the resolutions were a gratuitous insult
and amounted almost to war.
In conclusion Caffory said if the influ
ence of the United States was to be ex
tended over Cuba and the South American
countries it must be on the â wings of peace,
not on the pinions of war.
Call (D.) of Florida next addressed the
Senate. He spoke of the opponents of the
resolutions as "advocates of imperialism
on this continent" and criticized tneargu
ment of Caffery. As to the threats of pri
vateering upon American commerce in
case of war with Spain Call exclaimed:
"What com raerce have we to prey upon ?
Privateers can do us no harm. But there
is no possibility of war."
Call closed his speech at 4:10, and then
the floor was taken by Palmer (D.) of
Illinois, but as the hour was advanced,
and as there were very few Senators pres
ent, the matter went over until Monday
next.
The following bills were taken from the
calendar and passed: To provide times
and places for holding terms of United
States courts in Utah ; to grant right of
way over the public domain for oil-pipe
lines in Colorado and Wyoming; increasing

BLOCKED BY THE SNOW
Traffic Tied Up in Many Sec
tions of the Far North
and East.
Blizzards and Hurricanes Also Rage
and Great Damage Is Done
to Property.
NEW YORK, N.Y., March 14.â A heavy
snowstorm is general throughout the
State. At Niagara Falls the storm was
the worst of the season. The snow is
packed so hard that it will be some time
before the railroad tracks can be opened.
Snow in many places is two feet deep on
the level, and the drifts are enormous.
Railroad and other business is at a stand
still.
WATERTOWN, N. V., March 20.â A
blizzard nas prevailed throughout North
ern New York to-day, blocking the high
ways with drifts of new snow and delay
ing trains on all roads.
HUNTINGTON, W. Va., March 20.â The
Harts Creek region, fifty miles soutn, in
Lincoln County, was visited by one of the
most destructive hurricanes ever known
in that section last night. Trees and
fences were carried before the mighty
wind, and the large store building of R.
A. Lewis was torn from its foundation and
totally wrecked. No lives were lost, but
the property loss will be heavy.
MONTREAL, Que.. March 20 âA heavy
snowstorm has prevailed all over this sec

way traffic is much interrupted.
TORONTO, Ont., March 20.â One of the
worst storms in many years has been
raging all over Ontario for the past twen
ty-four hours, and as a result train service
is almost paralyzed. Only one train came
into Toronto to-day, while but one has left,
and it is stalled a few miles from the city.
A similar state of affairs is reported from
every railway center in the province.
SILVER GAIXIXQ FRIENUS.
Senator Teller Encouraged by the Stand
of Balfour.
WASHINGTON. D. C. March 20.â
Senator Teller said to-day that the action
of the British Parliament on the silver
question was encouraging. It was a long
step in advance, and contradicts the as
sertion frequently made by advocates of
the gold standard that silver is losing
ground in Europe.
"No one expects England to open her
mints for the unrestricted coinage of sil
ver," said he, "but wnat has occurred in
the British Parliament within the last few
days is gratifying to those who wish she
would do so. It indicates that public sen
timent is very strong when a man like
Balfour stands up and talus as be did. We
believe it is a most encouraging 3ymptom,
and that it will not be long before silver
coinage in India is resumed and silver is
recognized as money by the Bank of Eng
land. Never before has the British Parlia
ment been willing to make any concession
whatever, and I would not be surprised if
there snould soon be declared from that
source a movement in favor of an interna
tional agreement. The silver sentiment is
stronger among the people of Europe, as
well as the people of the United States,
to-day than it ever has been."
OBSCEXE LITERATURE.
Jlrary Penalty Proposed for Its Appcar
ancf in the Mails.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20.â The
House Commerce Committee to-day or
dered a favorable report on a bill to pre
vent the carrying of obscene literature and
articles designed for indecent and immoral
use from one State or Territory into an
other State or Territory. The bill carries
a penalty of five years' imprisonment at
hard labor and a fine of $6000 for each
violation of the law.
The House Postoffice Committee took
favorable action on the bill of Kiefer (R.)
of Minnesota to regulate the pay of letter
carriers. It fixes the pay of carriers in
cities of more than 75,000 population at
$600 for the first year's service; $800 for the
second ; $1000 for the third, and for the
fourth and thereafter $1200 per annum.
In cities of less than 75,000 the salaries for
the first three years are the same as that
for the third year, $1000 is the maximum.
The Senate bill defining fourth-class
mail matter so as to exclude bulky parcels
now sent by various executive* depart
ments was also favorably reported.
Nicaragua Canal Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20.â The
reporting of the Nicaraeua canal bill to
the full House Committe on Commerce
to-day showed that theWcommittee was
divided respecting its merits. Much addi
tional information is demanded before the
whole committee will agree to a favorable
report. Hearings will be held beginning
Wednesday next.
CRIPJPLEI* BY OVERWORK.
Collapse of Chief Engineer McCarty of
the San Francisco.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 20.-An
other victim has been added to the Ion?
list oi naval engineers who have collapsed
from overwork. A cablegram was received
at the Navy Department to-day from Ad
miral Selfridge, commanding the Euro
pean squadron, announcing that Chief
Engineer Gilbert McCarty of the flagship
San Francisco had been condemned by a
medical survey and that he would be sent
to the Brooklyn Hospital in charge of a
surgeon of that ship.
Mr. McCarty, although somewhat ad
vanced in yaers, has always been regarded
as a very vigorous man and his collapse
was totally unexpected, but the strain of
overwork seems to bear alike on the old
and the young of the engineer branch of
the naval service.
Two of the youngest chief engineers
have already been retired this your for
physical disability.
Chief Engineer McCarty's retirement is a
foregone conclusion, as his disability ia
paralysis. On account of the scarcity of
engineer officers and the necessity of put
ting several, new ships in commission it
will not be possible to send a chief engi
neer to take Mr. McCarty's place. Mean
while Passed Assistant William McFar
land will have charge of the San Fran
cisco's engines.

ments and the lot will be accepted.

MANY BENEFITS WOULD ENSUE
To Take Away the Power Now Held
by Transient Legislatures Is
Desired.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 20.-The
Senate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions this morning made a favorable re
port on the amendment to the constitution,
providing for the election of United States
Senators by a direct vote of the people.
The report is veiy voluminous. Among
' other things it says:
"In the judgment of your committee any
movement that looks to the right of the
people to be heard directly in the election
of Senators cannot but result beneficially
to all concerned. The adoption of this
proposed amendment will, in the judg
ment of your committee, bring the Senate
into more amicable relations with the peo
ple. It will relieve prejudices now exist
ing, which are becoming deeply and dan
gerously fastened upon the public mind.
It will invoke a spirit of mutual forbear
ance and respect as between the Senate
and the people, which unfortunately does
not now exist to that degree that is de
sirable.
"It will restore confidence. It will tend â 
to elevate the character, advance the dig- ;
nity, increase the usefulness, extend the j
influence and justly magnify the power of
the Senate, and at the same time promote i
the welfare of all the people of the repub- \
lie. The tendency of public opinion is to !
disparage the Senate and depreciate its dig- i
nity, its usefulness, its integrity, its power.
If there is any cause for this tendency in
tbe public mind, it should be relieved with
out delay."
"One weighty and personal objection to I
the present system of electing Senators by â¢
the Legislatures of the respective States," j
the report continues, "is tnat the power
and right of the individual voter are
hedged about and circumscribed, his will
is manacled; his volition paralyzed; he
cannot vote for his choice. The present
system is in practice, purpose and effect a
declaration that for some occult reason
which is in no way made manifest, it is un
safe and prejudicial to the public interests
to commit the election of Senators to a i
vote of the people."
Thf committee points ont that the ma
terial interests of the States suffer by rea- ;
son of tiie protracted Senatorial contests
that are of such frequent occurrence. In
stances in New YorK, Oregon, Washing
ton, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Ken
tucky are cited.
Popular opinion has, the committee â 
says, taken hold of the subject and the de
mand for this change is loud and em
phatic. The belief in the public mind is ;
rapidly gaining that proper deference is ]
not given oy the Senate of the Unitod I
States to the demands and interests of the j
people, and that is largely due to the fact
that Senators do not owe their positions to !
the people, who are permanent, but to the j
Legislatures, which are transient. In con
clusion the committee says:
"The people demand a voice in the elec
tion of Senators and such demand, in the
judgment of your committee, should be
respected. So whatever may be said to
the contrary, whatever may be thought of
the sanctity of the ' Constitution as it
stands, it must be admitted by all that the
people are becoming restive under its re
straints on the right of those entitled
under the constitution and laws to exer
cise the elective franchise. The move
ment of the people in the interest of the
people on this as on many other questions
is stalwart and universal, and the sooner
this great fact is recognized by the repre
sentatives of the Deople the better."

In Several Districts Ivco Sets of Delegates
Here Elected.
NEW YORK, N. V., Starch 20.â Con
ventions were held to-night in the thirty
five Assembly districts in the city to
choose delegates to the Republican State
Conversion to meet here next Tuesday.
The latter body will select four delegates
from the State at large and four alternates
to the National Convention at St. Louis.
There was considerable disorder in seve
ral of the districts, and notably in the
Twenty-fifth it was necessary to call upon
the police to clear the floor and maintain
quiet.
In the Thirtieth District the police were
a!f-o required and the unique spectacle of
two conventions in one room, Platt and
anti-Platt, was enjoyed. The din was
deafening, an'l of course two sets of dele
pates were elected.
Two sets of delegates were also elected
in the Thirty-tbird District, where a
tumult reigned for twenty minutes. The
poiine here too restored order, and but for
their presence serious trouble would have
occurred.
I:> the Thirty-second District convention
it was nearly linidnigiit before an organiza
tion cou!d be effected. Upon a preliminary
matter the Platt wing was outvoted by 62
to 4*. The Platt men thereupon im
mediately bolted and organized another
convention. The police did their utmost
to pre-^rve order. It is claimed by the
anti-Plait people that they elected their
deleo-iitea in the First, Second, Thirteenth,
Eighteenth and Twenty-seventh districts.
Iwo sets of delegates were elected in
several districts.
Among the prominent delegates are:
Cl auticey M. Depew, Edward Lauterbacb,
Leopold Stern, William M. Evarts, Fred
erick S. Gibbs, ex- Postmaster Van Cott.
In several of the conventions resolutions
indorsing the candidacy of Governor Mor
ton were adopted. In other districts there
were no resolutions and in no case was
any other candidate than Morton men

MURDERER AM* VAGRAyT.
Dearmond, Alias Rice, to Be Taken Back
to Texat for Trial.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 20.â A re
quisition was received yesterday at the
office of the United States District Attor
ney in Brooklyn from the United States
District Attorney in Paris, Tex., asking
for the arrest and forwarding to Texas of
J. W. Dearmond, who is at present a pris
oner in Raymond-street jail, where he is
serving a term oi thirty days on a charge
of vagrancy under the name of Charles
Rice. Rice's sentence in Brooklyn expires
at noon to-day.
Rice, or Dearmond, is wanted in Texas
to answer a charge of murder in the first
degree, found against him by a Unifed
States Grand Jury on May 26. 1891. Since
that time the officers of the Government
have been looking for him.
There were five other men indicted with
Rice, or Dearmond. The charge against
the prisoner is that on January 6, 1891, he,
with the other men, met a man named
Erward Howell in Pickens County, Indian
Territory, and demanded his money.
Howell, it is said, was a cattle-raiser and
had considerable money in his possession.
Dearmond, it is charged, with his asso
ciates, Jay in wait for Howell near his
home and shot him when he refused to
give them money. Then they robbed
him of what money he had in his posses
sion and afterward robbed his house. It
is expected that the officers from Texas
will be on hand with the necessary papers
when the prisoner is arraigned to-day and
that he will be taken back to Texas at once.
TO WED A XICGRO ORATOR.
Ex- Governor I'lnehback'a Daughter En

NEW YORK, N. V., March 20.â The
San says this morning: The most inter
esting news in colored Republican circles
in New York City last night was that the
Kon. Charles W. Anderson of the Twelfth
Congressional District is shortly to marry
a daughter of ex-Governor Pinckney Ben

ASSAILED JJV .A COURTROOM.
Postal Inspector Murphy the Target of a
Confidence Operator.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 20.â A Her
ald special from Atlanta, Ga., says: George
W. Dice, called by the secret service men
"Old Man Brokway of the West," made a
desperate effort yesterday afternoon to
kill Inspector Murphy of St. Louis, Mo.,
who is one of the prosecuting witnesses in
the case against him. This occurred in the
United States courtroom during a recess.
Dice says that Murphy is not treating
him fairly in his trial, and he claims to
have an arrangement with Murphy, under
which he told the story of the gang's op
erations. Dice was talking pleasantly
with some of the other Government offi
cials when Murphy drew near. He sprang
at Murphy's throat, but, being hurled
aside, grabbed a heavy chair and tried to
hit the detective, in the fight several peo
ple were knocked down, but no harm was
done.
The case against Dice Si believed to be a
strong one. Inspector Burns testified yes
terday that the alleged counterfeiter had
confessed, and had implicated J. S. Keener,
a bicycle dealer here. He is said to have
shipped a lot of stuff to Kansas City for
Dice, but he claims to be ignorant of the
box. Keener came here from Chicago.

VISALIA, Cat,., March 20.â The feeling
of indignation over the attempted robbery
of the Southern Pacific train near Goshen
Wednesday night is very great in this
DAN MeCALL, THE OUTLAW WHO WAS KILLED.
city. Severe punishment of the men who
are supposed to be the prime instigators
of the affair is demanded. That the offi
cers should have been informed in advance
of the proposed hold-up creates much
comment, and every one is eager to learn
how the plans of the robbers happened to
be told in such detail to the Sheriff. A
Call correspondent to-day interviewed the
gentleman who was tirst approached by
Britt, who gave the scheme away, and he
consented to tell the story, stipulating
that his name should not be used. He
said:
"About ten days ago Britt came to my
boarding-house and asked to see me. He
came into the sitting-room and told me
he nao a secret he desired to tell me. We
went out to the gate, where we could talk
without danger of molestation. Britt re
marked that he was a stranger in this
community, and that he de-ired to do the
public a great iavor. He assured me that i
by speaking be took his life in his hands.
He wanted me to tell the Sheriff the story
of a contemplated crime, but he wanted
me to go with him and introduce him to
Sheriff Merntt )x so that his story would be
believed.
"Britt said that Dan McCall and others
were going to hold up the Southern Pa
cific train and that he had entered into
the conspiracy so that he could prevent
the consummation of tbe plan. McCail
first told him that he could make money
easily if he had the right sort of blood in
him. Afterward the plot to rob the train
was matured. Brift said they were all
sworn to secrecy and loyalty, the penalty
for any one who backed down being sure
death.
"Under the circumstances Britt was
very cautious about what he said. He
told me that McCall waB in constant com
munication and consultation with Si Lov
ren and Charley Ardell, and that it was
those men who furnished trie guns and
ammunition. They, kept McCall braced
up all the time and gave him conlidence
by telling him the best detective in the
Southern Pacific force was dead, meaning
Hickey.
"Britt told me that it was McCall who
tried to hold ud Ben Hicks a short time
ago. McCall also talked about the prob
able profit in holding ud Dr. Patterson,
but Britt said he told him that the doctor
would have 100 much sense to carry much
money with him. I did not try to get all
of his story, but listened to enough to
convince me that he was telling the truth,
and I immediately had him meet Sheriff
Merritt, to whom he told everything.' 1
Arana, an old acquaintance of Dan Mc-
Call, was seen by a Call correspondent to
dcv. He gave the following lacts about
the dead robber:
â¢'McCall wns 38 years old. He was born
at Santa Cruz, where he left his mother,
two brothers and a son, a boy of about 15
years. McCall's wife died several years
ago. He shot and killed a man on the
coast before coming to this valley. The
man disputed a land claim which McCall
held, and it was shown in court that Mc-
Call had killed him in self-defen?e. Me- j
Call came to this valley with a tough citi
zen, who was afterwa'd killed in a row,
but he never got into trouble before."
Arana says also that McCall was invited
by John Keener about a year ago to go
north with him and assist in robbing a
stage in Calaveras County. Keener was
cutting wood with McCall about a month
before that stage robbury, in which Keener
lost his life. Britt says that McCall told
him of Keener's trying to get him to join
in the robbery.
Several days ago "Billy' 1 Ross, the al
leged pugilist, was seen carrying two
rifles to the repair-shop of Weaver & Wild.
On last Tuesday he was in the shop and
was heard to ask:
"Is them guns of Si's done yet?"
He was told they would be ready next
day. The next day, [Wednesday, the day
of the attempted robbery, a roustabout of
the Lovren saloon, known as "Frehchy,"
went to the repair-shop and stated that
"Mr. Si Lovren sentv me for two guns that
â¢Billy' Ross left to be fixed up."
After the two rifles, a Marlin and a Bal
lard, were given to him "Frenchy" left a
dog-collar to be repaired, with the remark
that Lovren would pay for all. That Mar
lin rifle was the one that Dan McCall had
with him when he mounte;i the tender
and tried to kill Deputies Daggett and
Reed. It was the weapon that Reed se
cured on the coal of the tender after the
dead robber had fallen off, and which is
now in the possession of the Sheriff.
The officers yesterday made a demand
on James Edwards, the barkeeper in
charge of the Lovren saloon, for the Bal
lard rifle. Edwards declined to deliver up
tlÂ»e rifle without an order from Lovren.
Officer Russell procured a search warrant
and then Edwards gave it up.
The red cheese cloih that had been
placed around the lantern intended to be
used by the robbers in stopping the train
was purchased by Si Lovren at the store
of the S. Sweet Company on Wednesday,
the day the attempt was made.
"Billy" Ross and Eugene La Crouche
were arrested and placed in jail. They are
the men who carried the rifles to and from
the gunshop to be repairedâ the rifles
which were used by McCall in the tight
with the oflicers. So far as known, the
only evidence against Ardell 13 the state
ment made by Britt that Ardell worked
with Lovren and helped supply the robber
with guns and ammunition. Haines will
be charged with being an accessory before
the fact, as he furnished the giant powder.
The wounded officers are getting along
nicely. Reed is around attending to his
duties, while hopes are entertained of the
I recovery of'Daggett.
The following is a synopsis of an editorial
I wiiich appeared in this evening's Visalia
Daily Times:
A wave of virtue is sweeping over this city at
the present time, and Lovren and Ardell, the
j men under arrest for complicity in the latest
attempt at train robbery, are being roundly
denounced as the leaders of a gang of outlaws.
i It is not nleasant to have the papers all over
the country writing about Visalia bandit?, for
our experience with Evans and Sontag demon
strated that such a reputation is not profitable
for the community. * * * The Times has no
desire to allay the feeling of inrtignatlon that
has been aroused by the arrest of Lovren and
Ardell. but it will be just as well if we look at
the situation honestly, and when we start
about worting out a reform we should not be
afraid to do a complete job.
When Assessor Coffee was killed in the Lov
ren dive the character of the plate was as well
known asit is to-day. The indignation arousea
by that murder was as great as it is now over
the supposed connection of Ardell and Lovren
in the latest attempted train robbery, in which
two brave officers were wounded, one of them
perhaps fatally. As a result of the popular
feeling at that time the Board of Supervisors
passed an ordinance by which such dives
could be closed up. It was thought that it
would be impossible to get seven freeholders
in Visalia to vouch for the good moral char
acter of Lovren or Ardell, but those worthies
had no trouble in getting more than the re
quired number of signaturesâ all of them sub
stantial business men. A decision of the Su
preme Court some months later deprived the
Supervisors of jurisdiction over granting
licenses to saloons in incorporated cities, but
the City Council of Visalia very soon there
after adopted an ordinance substantially like
the county ordinance.
Again it became necessary for the men who
were running the dive to get the signatures of
seven freeholders that thev*were men of good
moral character and proper persons to cou
duct a saloon. The best men in VisÃlia again
signed the petition and the dive, which has
been a stench in the nostrils of all law-nMding
citizens and the breedine-piaco for all manner
oi crime, obtained a permit to carry on the
devilish work. * * *
The Times has no desire to criticize the gen
tlemen who signed the petition in Lovren's
favor, for if the particular ones who did so
had not acceded to his request in that behalf
there are others who would. Rut what is
needed is a sentiment 1n the community that
will make the ordinance regulating the'grant
ing of licenses to questionable places where
liquor is sold effective. This city has had
enough advertising of the Lovren sort and our
pockets if not our conscience make it inmeni
tive that ituch blotches on our community
should be promptly removed.
Two brothers of Dan McCall arrived this
evening and the funeral will take place at
10 a. M. to-morrow. .

TWO FUTILE ATTEMPTS.
Throws Herself Before a Loco

the Fireman.
SAVED BT AN ENGINEER'S ACT.
He Stops the Train and Prevents a
Tragedy â Domestic Troubles
the Cause.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., March 20.â Mrs.
G. F. Eollins, the wife of a Southern Pa
cific fireman, attempted to commit suicide
last night by throwing herself across the
track before the eastbound overland train
as it was paassing through the yard after
leaving the depot. On the engine of this
train was Rollins, the woman's husband.
Engineer Dilly who waÂ« in charge of the
locomotive, acted so promptly in revers
ing and applying the air brake that the
woman's purpose failed. She sprang to
her feet and ran swiftly away, but after
the train got into motion again reap
peared and threw herself in front of the
engine a second time. Again the prompti
tude of the engineer saved her, and she
was caught by the engineer of a night
switch engine, who had her conveyed to
her home.
Mrs. Rollins' statement of the cause of
her attempted suicide is ns follows:
"My husband and I quarreled to-day
about his sister. When my husband came
home yesterday and found that I had
quarreled with his sister he told me that I
could pacK up my things and leave. This
drove me nearly crazy anu I determined
to kill myself in such a way that he would
never forget it. I wrote to him tilling him
what I intended doing and 1 tried to carry
out my purpose. It was not my fault that
I was not killed, as I did everything in
my power to have the engine crush me to
death. My husband has been good to me
with one exception, and that is that he
believes what his relatives say about me.
He always eives me his money and treats
me kindly, but when any trouble comes up
between me and his family he always takes
sides against me. I cnuld not stand it any
longer and rasolved to die."
Concluding, Mrs. Rollins said: "I am
glad I was not killed, because my husband
will be back at 5 o'clock to-night and per
haps he will forgive me and treat me more
kindly."
EXAMIXVRS MEET.

Board of Examiners, Bureau of Highways
and State Prison Directors held a joint
meeting this afternoon to determine what
fund should be drawn upon to settle the
bills of the rock-crushing plant which has

bill was not payable out. of that fund.
After consultation the matter was ad
justed.
The claim of $344 of Surveyor E. v f an
Gilden, who had been employed to survey
the ?ife for the jilant.was then considered.
The Board of Examiners refused to allow
the bill, as the Bureau of Highways had
acteu without consulting ttie board in his
engagement.
The members of the Bureau of High
ways contended that the work was neces
sary and they were personally responsible
for payment." It was finally aerreed that
the Prison Commissioners should inquire
into the matter at their meeting which
will be held to-morrow at Foisom.

ago that these men were trying to per
suade him and a woodchopper to rob the
Angels Camp stage. On that same nicht
they offered to supply himself and the
woodchopper with ammunition and guns.
They were to bury some money, so they
could get away in case there was a raid
made on them.
Dan did not consent to the scheme, and
when the stage was stopped there was but
one man known in it. He was the wood
chopper. Lovern and Ardell were not
suspected.

A Sad Note From the Mother

WILL PAY FOR THEIR CARE.
She Says They Will Come Into the
Possession of a Fortune at
Maturity.
PORTLAND, Ob., March 30.â The family
of B. F. Mansfield at Sunnyside was pre
sented with a beautiful pair of twins early
yesterday morning under extraordinary
circumstances. Miss Lucy Mansfield, the
eldest daughter, stepped to the front door
at that hour Sot the milk can left there
daily. Beside the can sue saw a large
wicker basket holding two very handsome
infants. The sight startled her and she
called for her father, who went out and
carried the basket into the house.
The bedding in the basket and the
dresses of the babes â a boy and a girl,
both about a week oldâ were of the cost
liest material. Pinned to the pink coverlet
beneath a gossamer blanket was a note,
written in a beautiful hand and evidently
penned by a woman of some education.
It read as follows :
Kind Friends: These children were born in
holy wedlock, but their father is far away
from the scene. I also am a stranger in your
â¢midst, having lived in Portland a month only.
For reasons I cannot explain I am compelled
to consign my little ones to your care, and I
pray you care well for them, so that the bless
ing of God may rest upon you.
Herein I inclose $20 for their first month's
care, and a similar sum will be transmitted to
you on the first of every month hereafter.
Should anything befall my children, or
should you at any time remove from your
present home, communicate arch fact to
"Alpha and Omega" care of the Anglo-Califor
nia Bank at San Francisco. In time, if condi
tions permit, I will mako myself known to
you; but should such time never arrive I as
sure you that the children will have a good
competency when reaching their majority.
You also shnll be better rewarded for what
kindnesses you may bestow upon them. May
God bless you and my little ones, from whom I
am parted by a cruel fate.
The letter bore no signature, and the
Mansfields are at a loss to account for
their selection to carry out the mission im
posed upon them. They have not the re
motest idea who the mother of the twins
is, but as Mansfield, who is a mechanic, is
not well provided with worldly goods the
promised $20 a month will prove a help to
them. The mother is presumably well-to
do, and future rewards are expected from
her.

THE INJUNCTION PROCEEDINGS
A Large Array of Legal Talent Has
Eeen Employed by Both Sides
to the Controvefsy.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 20.â The
Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic
Railroad is in a predicament, its engine
is upon one side of the road and cannot be
removed to the other side until the in
junction proceedings brought by Maurice
Windmiller are disposed of. An effort was
made to-day by the mountain road people
to obtain an order from Judge Angelotti
of the Superior Court of Marin County
to allow them to lay rails across the roads
in order that the engine might be removed
past the points in dispute.
The president of the road promised that
the rails would immediately be taken up
after the engine hai been transferred from
its present position on the lands of the
North Pacific Coast Railroad at Eastlanu
station to the Cushing property, where.it
could be used for hauling material used
in the construction of the Tamalpais
mountain road.
Judge Angelotti decided that he had no
right to allow the company to lay any
rails upon the roads for any purpose until
the injunction proceedings had been
heard.
President Sidney B. Cushing of the Mill
Vally and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Rail
road applied to the Superior Court to-day
to obtain an order setting an earlier date
than the 22d inst. for the hearing of the
order to show cause why the injunction
obtained by Maurice Windmiller should
not be made permanent. Mr. Cushing
was represented by Hepburn Wilkms of
San Rafael, who earnestly pleaded that the
time be shortened as much aÂ« possible, ard
said the delay in the construction of the
r >ad was consuming a >:ri 3 a: deal of time
andmoney. The matter of asking for a
larger bond than $500 on the injunction
was also submitted to Judge J^ngellolti,
who stated that the bond should -tand as
it was. The time for hearing the order to
show cause was shortened one tiay, and
the matter will now come up next Monday.
The Mill Valley Property- owneis'
Protective Association, which is behind
Windmiller in his action against the
mountain road, has thus far succeeded in
eainine every point in the legal battle for
possession of tlie Mill Valley roads. The
injunction issued and served yesterday is
being respected to the letter, and not a
stroke of work nas been done upon the
roads, which are dug up and left in the
condition they were in when the papers
enjoining the work were served.
On sidetracks at Sausalito and at the
railroad shops of the North Pacific Coast
road are many cars loaded with rails and
'ties to be used in the construction of the
scenic railroad.
There is no place in Mill Valley where
the cars can be sidetracked, as ail the
available space is occupied, and on account
of the injunction no cars can be run across
the roads, so it is impossible for the moun
tain road people to haul the material to
the men at work further up the line.
One thousand ties were unloaded yester
day from the steamer Progress at the rail
road wharf at Sausalito, but these cannot
be shipped to Mill Valley, as they would
only add to the great mass of material
that has already gone and is accumulating.
The work of laying the track in Mo-
Innes' back yard goes merrily on, and all
that part of the route that is not affected
by the injunction is being pushed to com
pletion as rapidly as possible.
LA GRANGE TRAGEDY.
R ancher R. B. Randall Shoots and Kills His
Son While Suffering From Mental
Aberration.
SPELLING, Cal., March 20.-R. B. Ran
dall, a well-known rancher living near La
Grange, shot and mortally wounded his
son, Hazzard Randall, this morning. The
elder Randall has for some time past shown
signs of insanity, and his family has kept
a watch upon his movements.
The old man came out with a Winches
ter rifle this morning and asked his son if
he could go hunting. The son replied,
pleasantly :
"Oh, no, you do not want to go hunting
to-day."
"I can't go then," the old man re
marked, and immediately he sent a bullet
through the left breast of his son, just
above the heart. He then turned the gun
upon his wife, b ut before be could shoot j
another son caught him, and with his i
mother overpowered the old man and i
bound him with ropes until Constable
Roquet arrived. He was taken to Sonora.
Randall is about 60 years old, is wfill-to
do, and has always borne a good name.
He does not seem to realize what he has
done, but he expressed a hope that his son
would notdie. The son, Hazzard RaTidall,
was about 23 years of age. Several physi
cians were called but could do no good.
He died about 3 o'clock this afternoon.

CLARKSON AT SEATTLE.
Strength of the Several Presidential Can
didates Compared by the lowa
Statesman.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 20.â General
J. S. Clarkson of lowa, accompanied by
State Senator William H. Andrews of
Pennsylvania and Colonel Isaac Trumbo
of Utah, arrived in Seattle to-day from
California. Regarding his mission here,
General Clarkson said it was one of busi
ness pleasure and politics.
"However," he continued, "I am not
louring the Pacific Coast la the interest of
Senator Allison's Presidential candidacy,
aa has been reported. It is true that lam
for William B. Allison for President, and
as a National delegate will attend the con
vention and work and vote for his nomina
tion, which I feel confident will be brought
about in the last count."
Referring to the reported instructions of
many Southern delegates for McKinley
the general said :
"As a matter of fact McKinley has not
to exceed one-third of about 100 delegates
chosen. Those selected from the South
are about evenly divided between Reed,
Allison and McKinley. The latter, whose
position in this contest is a peculiarly
dangerous one, will not have at any time
in the convention to exceed 300 votes."
Having referred to Senator Quay as be
ing very mucu in earnest in his candidacy
for the" Republican Presidential nomina
tion General Clarkson concluded : "Mc-
Kinley represents one ideaâ protection â
while Allison is the embodiment of all
good ideas; and for that matter he intro
duced two protection bills in Congress
before McKinley was heard of. Quay ia
just as acceptable a protectionist as the
Ohio candidate dare be."
General Clarkson thinks the chief issues
of the coming campaign will be bimetal
lism and protection.
GHASTLY FIND AT HOLLISTER.
The Bodies of Two Men Discovered in a
Barn Near the Town â Bore No
Marks of Violence.
HOLLISTER, Cal., March 20.â A ghast
ly find was made by Otto Schultz in a barn
near town this morning. Lying on its
back in the straw was the body of a man,
the features contorted and the limbs drawn
up. From a manger protruded tne arm of
another body, also contorted in agony.
Neither could be identified. The men
had never been seen in this vicinity.
There were no marks of- violence, but dili
gent search revealed no poison in the
vicinity. The bodies were brought to
town, and autoDsies are now being made
by Coroner Black and County Physician
o'Bannon.
A tramp was seen to enter the barn at
sunset and leave hurriedly in the directiou
of the San Joaquin, and the supposition is
that he was frightened at sight of the
corpses. One body is that of an American,
tall, spare, with iron gray hair and a
mustache. He was about 40 years of age.
The other is that of an Irishman, with
close-cropped red hair, and about 35 years
old. â¢ Both were dressed as farm laborers.
SASTJL KHiHA Hi CAPTURE.
â  Enormous Devilfish Brought to the Shore
by Two Fishermen.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 20.â
! A large devilfish, far exceeding in propor
: tions any ever before seen in this channel,
was to-day brought over from the islands
by two Italian fishermen named Larco.
The deep-sea monster undertook to take
possession of Gennie Larco's boat yester
day, the first notification of \ its approach
being an ugly, slimy arm thrown over the
boat's gunwale. The young men drove a
long gaff 'nto the creature's body and
hauled it in.
It was found to measure fifteen feet from
tip to tip and ten feet from the bead to
the end of 'he longest arm. The animal,
denuded of its skin and somewhat
shrunken by the sun. has been on exhibi
tion at the Larco place, on lower State
street, to-day, and ha 3 drawn throngs of
sight-seers.

SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 20.â Del
Kirby, whose exploits in stealing a boat
and a lot of sporting goods in Petaluma
recently have earned for him the title of
the "pirate," was sentenced to Whittier
Reform School to-day. The lad's father,
an old G. A. R. veteran and an almost
helpless crinple, appeared before the court
and asked Judge Daingerfield to send his
boy to the reform school until he attained
his majority. His request was granted by
the Judge, and the "pirate" will therefore
have a little more than three years to
serve before he can again follow the ex
ample of Captain Kidd.

SANTA ROSA, Cal.. March 20.âPrep
arations for the carnival are going steadily
forward. Twenty thousand envelopes of
local design have been printed and will be
used by most of the people here in their
correspondence until after the fiesta. The
invitations sent to Governor Budd, Mayor
Sutro ana dozens of other distinguished
people to be present during the festival
bave in many cases been accepted already.
One of the principal features of the en
tertainment will be the big bicycle meet.
The Santa Rosa Wheelmen have received
from R. M. Welch, chairman of the racing
board for this division, a sanction for a
three days' racing meet during the car
nival. The services of W. F. Knapp, bet
ter known as "White Flyer Kiiapp," have
been secured as announcer. Knapp was
in town to-day makiag arrangements for
the accommodation of the three racing
teams, to include Kennedy, Osen, Zeigler,
Bald, Edwards. Wells, Terrill, Hamilton
and Rigby. Kiser, Randall and others
will also be present. (*Â«orge Haralin,
holder of the world's five-mile road record,
was here today. He will be one of the
competitors for the handsome prizes of
fered.
The new bicycle track being built for
the Santa Rosa Wheelmen is rapidly near
ing completion and will be one of the
speediest in the country. It was de signed
L>y Elwell, is three laps to the raiJe and
will cost upward of $2000. Hereafter
Santa Rosa will be permanently included
in the racing circuit, and with this fine
track to practice upon some of the local
riders are expected to develop into "crack
ajacks." F. Ed Spooner, sometimes called
"On-tbe-Spot" Spooner, will be at the
meet and will probably hold an official po
sition.
The vote for queen to-day was the larg
est cast this week. It is thought that
Miss Mattie Forsyth has received the
largest vote to-day and is well up among
the leaders. The vote will again be
counted to-morrow night and a fresh im
petus given to the contest by the addition
of several new names.
SAXIA BAlili.HiA'S PETE.
Monster Pavilion to Be Built for the
Flower Carnival.
BANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 20.â A
very interesting discussion has for some
time been progressing in regard to the
preparations for the forthcoming flower
festival ball. A proposition to use the
dining-room of the leading hotel, thereby
confining the dancers to a limited space,
making a fancy dress ball impossible and
reducing the affair to the level of an ordi
nary crowded hotel hop, with no distin
guishing features, was for a time sus
tained. Wiser counsels have happily pre
vailed and it is now decided that a tem
porary pavilion will be erected on the Ar
lington grounds on a much more extensive
scale than last year and with more elabor
ate decorations. Sixty thousand feet of
lumber will be employed in the building,
which will have a tent canopy top. The
ball will open with lancy figures, flowers
to be represented by the various costumes
as far as possible, and suitable arrange
ments will be made to exclude other
dancers from the floor during the opening
numbers.
The committee in charge of arrangements
is planning to add extra seats to the
tribunes for the especial accommodations
of the National Hotel Men's Association,
which will be the guests of the city during
its stay here.

LOS ANGELES. Cal.. March 20.â A
special fruit train, bound north, was
wrecked last evening at Palmdale, a sta
tion on the Southern Pacific, in the Ante
lope Valley. The train was pulling into a
newly made switch, which proved too
weak and collapsed under the great weight.
Two cars were demolished, and luscious
oranges littered the ground. Passenger
trains were delayed until a wrecking crew
from this city reached the scene of the
wreck and cleared the track.
Salmon in Monterey Bay.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 20.-There
was a big run of sardines in the bay to-day,
and five boats took twenty-five salmon
close in to the shore by trolling. This is
not a big catch of salmon, but it indicates
that, following their natural food, the sar
dines, they are coniing in again in large
numbers, and, while the fishermen do not
expect another extraordinary run until
June, they are anticipating fine fishing
for the month of April. The salmon now
are mostly in the outer edge of the bay,
and will require deep fishing to eaten
them.

ATALOX MAX'S IXVEXTIOX.
G l as â¢- Bottomed Boat Through Which Sea
Animals Can Be Watched.
AVALON, Catalixa Island, March 20.â
A boat with a glass bottom is the recent
invention of a boatman at Avalon (Chris
Anderson), who has lived on ihe island
eight or nine years. Anderson has applied
for a patent and will doubtless reap a
golden harvest from his invention.
A favorite pastime of visitors at Cata
lina is to drift along the shore of Avalon
Bay and around Sugar Loaf watching
through a water-glass the movements of
the various sea animals and the waving
beds of kelp in tne waters, which are so
clear that one can see distinctly to a depth
of fifty feet or more. This boat is espe
cially designed for such excursions, and is
constructed to carry eighteen people at a
time. In the center of the bottom is a
Ions; section of glass an inch thick, divided
into three compartments, and around this
immense water-glass are arraneed cojti
fortable seats. The -Â»boat is in great de
mand by tourists.

VICTORIA, B. C, March 20.â Alaska
advices just received report the following
interesting incident: During a recent run
down Gastineaux Channel, while in Alas
kan waters, the life-saving crew of the cut
ter Walcott had an opportunity to test its
efficiency. Captain Phillip3 was on deck
aft, and was wishing for a chance to test
his men's ability when a middy's hat, blew
overboard, the cutter at the time being at
full speed.
"Man overboard !" cried the captain, and
like a flash the crew then on watch was at
the davits, the boat was unlashed and
swung out, and in twenty seconds the sKiff
had left the ship's side. "The hat was re
covered, and upon reaching the ship the
boat was quickly made fast and hoisted,
1 and rescuers and rescued were again on
deck in just four minutes from the time
they left.

one of the pioneer settlers in the county,
was held to answer by Judge Austin to-
I day on the charge of a-sault to com
! Mit murder upon his daughter. Bail was
fixed at $5000, and this he was unable to
furnish.
Viau is a fairly well-to-do orange-grower
on Kings River. He has been a heavy
drinker of wine of his own make for sev
eral years, and, while crazed with it. has
made several attempts to exterminate his
family. While intoxicated on Sunday
night last about 11 o'clock he approached
his daughter, Maggie, with a shotgun and
attempted to strike her with the barrel.
The blow was avoided by her seizing the
gun and thrusting it aside. A few words
followed and Viau, stepping bank a short
distance, raised the gun and tired at his
daughter. The shot passed over her head
and lodged in the ceiling.
The girl, terrified at the action of her
father, ran from the house to the road,
whither the remainder of the family had
just retreated. Fearing to remain near
the house longer all four started to walk to
Sanger, a distance of over seven miles.
After walking some distance they came to
a farmhouse, where they found some one
to take them the balance of the way in a
carriage. The next day a warrant for
Viau's arrest was issued, and he was
brought to this city and lodged in the
County Jail.

POMOXA'S OR ASM E CHOP.
The Shipping Season Star if* Clote and
Prices Advancing.
POMONA, Cat,., March 20.â As the
orange shipping season nears its close it
becomes more and more apparent that the
first estimates of the orange crop in
Southern California were much too large.
In fact the estimate which was put upon
the crop last fall by '.he best judges, viz..
10,000 carloads, was nearly twice as large
as the output is proving to be. There have
been shipped out of Southern California
thus far this eeason 4000 carloads of
oranges, and there are not over 1500 car
loads more remaing to be moved to
market.
While the severe wind of the cany winter
did more damage to oranses than was at
tirst thought and the frosts that followed
injured the fruit in some sections, yet it is
now evident that the entire crop on the
trees was lighter than the growers and
shippers thought it would be.
The orange-growers are rejoicing over
the marked rise in the pricps now offered
for their fruit and there is little doubt that
the balance of the crop will be marketed
rapidly. The exchange at this place has
sold several cars during the past week at
prices in the Eastern markets that net
from ?2 25 to $2 35 per box f. o. b. at
Pomona.
These are the highest prices reported at
which oranges have sold in carload lots
since the holidays. The recent rains and
heavy fall of snow in the mountains,
which give assurance of abundance of
water for irrigation during the coming
summer, have relieved the fruit-growers of
consi erable anxiety, and the outlook for
another season is now promising.

ST. HELENA POLITICS.
Zlvfhj Campaign in the Interest of Eco
nomical Governtntnt,
ST. HELENA.CaI March 20.â The fight
for political control of St. Helena was fairly
begun last night by the nomination of a
ticket for Town Trustees.
At a meeting of business men and prop
erty-owners George Schoenwald, H. L.
Chiles, W. E. York and G. W. Schmidt
were selected to contest for the seats of
, four Trustees whose terms expire April 13.
None out of the outgoing Trustees were
renominated except Chiles, who resigned
a month ago, but all have announced a
determination to run.
Ex-Mayor and Trustee Stubs left the
board because of its extravagant handling
of the town funds, there being a deficit of
$4000. The members whose, terms end
with the fiscal year say they want to be re
elected, so as to clean up their debts,
which, while they were lawfully con
tracted, cannot lawfully be paid out of
this year's taxes.
All the new men nominated are heavy
property-owners, and go into the tight
at the u r gent request of many leading cit
izens.
Mayor Chiles' renomination is an in
dorsement of his protests against former
extravagance.
For Clerk, L. G. Clark, David C. Cole
Otto Behms and. James H. Sciaroni are all
candidates. For Marshal, J. G. Johnson
(incumbent) and 0. H. Blank are candi
dates. All are making a personal right for
the spoils of office. George H. Riggins
has no opposition to succeed himself as
Treasurer. Local politics will be the ab
sorbing theme for the next three weeks.
LOS ANGELES TO t/nyASItCXT.
Crack Marksmen Contest at Weatlnke
Park Butts.
LOS ANGELAS, Ckh., March 20.â The
second semi-annual tournament of the
Los Angeles Gun Club opened to-day on
the grounds of the club near Westlake
Park. The attendance was large, many
society people of both sexes being present
to witness the sport. Ihe weather was
fine and the best marksmen in the State
took part in the shooting.
H. S. Fanning of San Francisco beat the
field on individual average, making the
long straight break of forty-four pigeons.
In the sweepstakes the best all-round
shooting whs done by Mason of Santa Ana.
In the twenty-five birds sweepstakes,
Sedom of Denver won first money with a
score of 24 birds ; Taber of Riverside, sec
ond, 23; Van Valkenberg of Los Angeles,
22; Chick of San Diego, 21.
The most important event of the day
was the E. C. Smokeless Powder Com
pany's team shoot. Vauchan and Mason
of Santa Ana won first prize in this event
with a total of forty-five birds out of a
possible fifty. Fanning and Chick shot
together and the former broke his twenty
five birds straight, but Chick missed seven
of his. The score in this, the last event of
the day, was as follows:
Santa Ana teamâ Vaughan 24, Mason 21.
Total, 45.
E. C. Smokeless Power teamâ Fanning 25,
Chick IS. Total, 43.
Riverside teamâ Packard 19, Taber 23. Total
42.
Fanning was in fine form, but Chick's
work was a disappointment to his friends.
The San Diego man was nervous. To
morrow's programme contained some in
teresting events. Many crack shots will
participate.
MASONIC TEMPLE BURNED.
Fire Reduced a Magnificent Bui/ding at
Providence, Rhode Island, to
Ashes.
PROVIDENCE, R. 1., March 20.â The
handsome building of the Masonic frater
nity in this city is in ruins. The loss is
estimated at $500,000.
Fire was discovered in the building about
4 o'clock yesterday morning. It had. evi
dently been burning for some time and had
gained considerable headway, for after the
alarm was turned in it spread rapidly, and
when the firemen arrived it was so far
advanced that there was little hope of sav
ing the building.
In half an hour from the time the fire
was discovered all the central and rear
parts of the building were in flames. The
high walls of the building acted like a
chimney and the fire burned fiercely, the
flames rising high into the air. This part
of the building contained the halls and the
various lodgerooms.
The firemen operating the water-tower
had a narrow escape. The tower was set
at work in Dorrance street, and had been
dome good service.
The wall, however, became unsafe and
the tower was removed. It had just been
taken from the piace when the wall fell
outward into the street, burying the spot
the tower had occupied deep under hot
bricks.
The fire was not brought under control
until 5:30 o'clock, at which time the
Masonic building was a total loss and the
buildings in the rear were badly damaged.
DAVIS' FRUIT PROSPECTS.
Only the Almondg Suffered From the
Recent Frott.
LAVIS, Cal., March 20.â After a suffi
cient lapse of time since the frost of the
3d inst. it may now be stated that the loss
to the almond crop will be considerable.
The Languedoc will be about two-thirds of
a crop, and of other kinds about one-fifth
of a crop. Fruits of various kinds are nut
damaged, and in places they will have to
be thinned out.
The Oak Shade Fruit Company con
tends there has been no damage, but those
in a position to know, and who have ex
amined the almond trees, say that the loss
will be considerable.
The weather for the last week has been
deligtitful. Everything is growing finely.
Prospects for a good grain crop were never
better.
Coursing at St. Louis.
ST. LOUIS. Mo., March 20.â Turnstile

EXCITEMENT AT STANFORD
Meeting 01 the Student Body-
Ends it an Uproarious
Clamor.
Quarrel Over tke Proposed Adoption
of a Uniform "Sweater" for
Athletes.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cat,.,
March 20.â A meeting of the student body
was held to-day to take final action on the
report of the athletic board on the uni
versity sweater. The athletic board had
submitted a report favoring the adoption
of a uniform university sweater of car
dinal and having a white block "S,"
which any member of a team which con
tested with Berkeley would be privileged
to wear. An exception was made in favor
of trackmen, that only those winning a
point against Berkeley might have this
privilege.
The football men bitterly opposed the
adoption of the report, claiming that the
value of their sweaters would be lessened
if every one wore the same style. Varsity
Captain Jb'ickert, Campbell '96. tackle on
last year's Varsity football team, and Zion
'95 were the leaders of the opposition,
while vVilbur, presi dent of the '96 class,
and Spalding '96, end on the Varsity
team of '95, defended the proposi
tion. They held that a uniform sweater
would encourage the other branches nf
athleticsâ baseball, tenni3 and track ath
letics â which were not regarded as favor
ably as football and were somewhat
neglected. The first victory was scored by
the football men by a vote of 69 to 68. A
recount was demanded, and during the
interval new-comers had arrived who
favored the uniform sweater, so the final
vote was 75 to 71 in favor of the proposi
tion.
The excitement became so intense and
the disorder so great that President Shel
don declared the meeting adjourned.
President Sheldon announced later that a
meeting would take place about two weeks
from to-day to reconsider the proposition,
as the football men have called for a re
count.
Interest in athletics is increasing as the
ti.ne of the intercollegiate track meet ap
proaches. A number of men are on the
track every day and nearly all are gettine
into form. The entire track team and the
baseball candidates will continue their
work faithfully throushout the vacation of
the coming week, and the rest from studies
ana the entire attention of the men to ath
lethics will bring a marked improvement
by the beginning of college work.
"Several interesting amendments to the
constitution of the student body have
been proposed. They relate to the elec
tion of the business manager and editor of
the Daily Palo Alto, the university daily.
Heretofore these men have been elected
by a board of representatives from the va
rious classes. >iow it is proposed to elect
them by direct vote of the student body.
The Sequoia management will in the next
election be chosen in this manner.
Dr. Gilbert Returns.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 20. â Dr. C. H. Gilbert and the
Panama expedition of which be has
charge returned to the university yester

Free If you call.SILVER AND POPULISM
The Parties of Both Are Wait
ing for Their National
Conventions.
LOCAL POPULISTS WAKE UP.
The Twin Local Democratic Organiz
ations Make Further Plans for
Fratricidal War.
The Populist party is being pulled into
campaign shape by W. M. of Los
Angeles, chairman of the State Central
Committee, who has recently returned
from an Eastern tour, followed by a trip
to Oregon and Washington. He will now
proceed to waken things up preparatory
to the State Convention, to meet in Sacra
mento May 12.
The Populists are counting much on a
coalition with the free-silver men of toe
State, who may be led to forsake the old
parties in this issue. The free silver men
do not know iust what they will do. There
is a Bimetallic League, organized last
August, but no campaign activity has
been displayed or is likely to be before the
meeting ot the National Silver Convention
at St. Louis, July S2i The Populist cam
paign will not be definitely mapped out
until after the Populist Convention, which
George W. Baker, Chairman of the Bimetallic League of California and Member
of the National Bimetallic League.
\lrom a photograph.]
will meet in St. Louis on the same date as
the silver convention.
Joseph Asbury Johnson, an able writer
in the cause of Populism, has attracted
the attention of politicians throughout the
State by hia letters in The Call. Mr.
Johnson outlined several weeks ago the
policy that will probably be followed by
the National conventions of the Populist
anÂ«l silver parties, namely, to hold concur
rent but not joint sessions; to adopt sepa
rate platforms with concessions to both
sides, and join forces in making nomina
tions for President and Vice-President of
the United .States, both conventions nomi
nating the same candidates.
George W. Baker, chairman offlthe Bi
metallic League and member of the Na
tional League, said yesterday that the
silver men would insist on the free and un
limited coinage of siiver at the ratio of
16 to 1. In case of the failure of either the
Republican or the Democratic National
conventions 10 insert a free coinage plank
and to nominate a candidate friendly to it,
the silver men propose to nominate a
candidate for President themselves, upon
that issue alone. An effort was beine
made, he paid, by Republican Senators
and manufacturers in Pennsylvania and
elsewhere to urge the question of silver
and protection, but Mr. Baker had not
much faith in their ability to persuade the
National conventions. The Republican
State conventions in the East are in favor
of what they call sound money, by which
tbev mean gold.
"1 cannot see any reason to oppose the
proposition to insert in our platform the
Populist plank of direct legislation or the
submission to the people of any great
question affecting the entire people for
ratification before it beconus a law," con
tinued Mr. Baker. "1 am a Republican in
{)olitics, but, at the same time, I believe
n the submission to the people of ail
g*eat public questions, such as the election
oi liv tert States Senators. I don't believe
that the people of the United States, or of
any State therein, ?<hould be denied the free
expression of their will upon any great
queeriot) that affects them in their do
mestic economy or personal liberty, and
for that reason 1 am in full accord with
the proposition of direct legislation."
Mr. Bafeer added that the Bimetallic
League recognized the fact that the Popu
lists are silver men, and in order to head
off Debs and Taubeneck, who is chair
man of the Populist National Committee,
the Bimetallic League sent three men to
California to tne meeting of the Pouulist
National Committee with the view of in
aucing them to postpone the meeting of
the Populist National Convention until
after the Democratic and Republican
conventions had framed tneir platforms
and nominated their candidates. The
object was also to persuade, if possible, the
Populists to leave out the Omaha plat
form this year, "for the reason," added
Mr. Baker, "'that it is overloaded with too
many issues for one campaign, and to join
with us in the bimetallic free coinage of
silver the restriction of banks of L<sue and
the issue of money by the Government, so
that gold, silver and paper would be legal
tender for ail debts, public and privaie.
"The result of this movement was that it
was ajrreed to hold both conventions in St.
Louis on the same day. On that occasion
there will be a strong effort made to fuse
the two parties and to eliminate from Ihe
platform what we considered the ob
noxious features. I am in favor of the
rearing of the National banks and the
issuing of money by the Government.
"During President Cleveland s adminis
tration we have had $200,000,000 of bonds
issued to form a basis for tne establishment
of more National banKs."
Mr. Baker added that W. H. Mills had
informed him that out of 131 newspapers
in California, the editors of which had been I
interviewed by him, more than 100 were in
favor of bimetallism, against either of the
old parties, should it come to a direct issue. |
Fifty-five delegates will be sent from this i
State to the Bimetallic National Conven- J
tion, which will contain 1340 delecates. It
will be the largest public National conven
tion ever known in America.
T. V. Cator reported the Populists as De
ing thoroughly organized throughout the
State and that their ranks were increasing
daily. Thirty-nine delegates will be sent
to the National Convention at St. Louis.
In this City the clubs in the eighteen
Assembly districts will be reorganized.
For this purpose the executive committee
will meet every Saturday evening hence
forward at Mozart Hall. After the State
Convention shall have finished its labors
the State Executive Committee will open
headquarters, open to the public daily.
Reports come in to the effect that new
Populist clubs are being organized in every
precinct in the State. In all the precincts
of Shasta County clubs are being organ
ized where none existed before.
Assemblyman T. \V. H. Shanahan of
Shasta hasleft a big gap in the Democratic
ranks of that county by forswearing his
Democracy and joining the Populists. Mr.
Shaii.ihan, in a card recently published in
the Redding Searchlight, thus slaps the
Democracy:
"When it comes to following a so-called
Democratic party which out-Shermans
Sherman it is asking too much of a Jeffer
sonian Democrat."
The California silver men will await the
developments of those conferences as well
as the doings of the other parties. The
Populists will not know until after that
date whether there will be fusion with the
silver men and how to build their State
platform. In San Francisco the Populists
have begun the word of actively reviving
and bunding up their party organization.

CARPENTERS' UNION.
A New Organization for Italian,
French and Spanigh Work
men.
A number of Italian, French and Span
ish carpenters in this City have amal
gamated into a union, their principal ob
ject being to obtain a day of eight hours'
labor and to fix the rate of remuneration
for their labors at not less than $3 a day.
The organization, which held its first
meeting in Apollo Hall on Thursday, will
be known as the Unione dei Falegnami
Italiani, Francesi c Spagnuoli (the Union
of Italian, French and Spanish Carpen
ters). At the meeting it was stated that
there are a number of workmen at North
Beach and in other parts of the City and
State who hesitate about joining the ex
istine unions because they understand
English imperfectly. No knowledge of
English will be necessary in order to join
the new union, but it is intended, from
time to time, to hold discussions in Eng
lish, in order to familiarize the members
with that language.
In the Italian colony there are at least
200 carpenter?, and those interested in pro
moting the new organization point out
that it all joined the union they would be
strong enough to accomplish a good deal.
C. F. Schadf explained at the meeting all
the benefits that the organization would
confer upon its membeis, laying particu
lar stress upon the eight hours' labor and
the $3 a day. G. Maccono gave some sug
gestions in English; and Pietro Gori
strongly urged the North Beach carpen
ters to combine in oraer to secure their
rights.
On Thursday evening the constitution
was signed by : E. Picasso, J. Corsiglia,
O. Maccono, S. Cavallera, J. M. Bologna,
A. Davini, F. Postiglione, S. Sobrino, V.
Mazzati, G. B. Dondero, G. B. Rocca,
Carlo Rosso, Biagio Posrgi, D. Perrier.
There will be a meeting of the new or
ganization on Tuesday next, at 8 p. m., to
select a president and secretary and to
make application for recognition to the
central committee of similar organiza
tions, wnich is situated in Philadelphia.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, J896.
STRIKERS WILL COMPETE
They Will Give the Bosses Until
Monday to Effect a
Settlement.
WILL THEN BID FOR WORK.
Claim That They Will Be Able to
Underbid the Master Painters
on All Work.
So far as the journeymen painters are
concerned the strike that is now fairly on
is not to be a passive one, but they are in
clined to give the master painters, they
say, all the time necessary to consider the
situation fully and in all its bearings be
fore they take aggressive action. It is not
to be understood, however, that by aggres
sive action is meant anything in the shape
of violence, for such a course is deprecated
by every one who has any influence as a
leader of the striking union men.
There was a meeting yesterday afternoon
of the Painters' and Decorators' Union, at
which the committees which have engaged
in the work of calling out all the men at
work made their reports. These were most
encouraging to the strikers, as they were
to the effect that with but very few excep
tions all the men had promptly responded
to the call of the union to quit work.
The matter of co-operaiion on the part
of members of the union for the purpose
of competing with the master painters for
the painting jobs to be done was considered,
and a committee of twenty-five was ap
pointed to devise plans for carrying the
proposed scheme into operation, should
the bosses not have effected a settlement
with the strikers by Monday next.
Speaking of this phase of the situation,
Mr. Mclvor said yesterday:
"We have been offered any amount of
work, and some of the bosses have come
to us to take the contacts that they have
been unable to complete off their hands.
In fact, we can get all the work we want,
but we do not care to go into competition
with the bosses unless we have to. but if
we are forced to go into the market to pro
tect ourselves we will soon demonstrate
that we are better able to do the work at
low rates than the present bosses, and we
will do this, even if we have to make great
personal sacrifices."
Referring to the statement of President
Black of the Master Painters' Association,
Mr. Mclvor said : "Mr. Black says that the
combination between the master painters
is not to defeat the journeymen, but that
it is to secure materials at a discount from
the prices that are charged outsiders. We
believe that the object of this movement
is to prevent us or property-owners from
baying the materials at the same rate that
has been charged the bosses, so as to pre
vent us from entering the market in com
petition with them.
"He also says that the property-owners
are with the master painters, as should
the} r lose it would increase the cost of re
pairs for them. That is not so, and he
knows it. Property-owners of the jour
neymen themselves can buy the material
for the same price that it is bought
by the bosses, and as for the matter
of wages the property-owner always
lias been charged the full union scale of
wages whether the boss has actually been
paying them or not. I went to the whole
salers myself and they are willing to let us
have stock on the same conditions on which
they are sold to the master painters, and
we do not ask for anything else."
Energetic work is being done to make
the mass-meeting at Metropolitan Hall to
night a grand success. The musicians
have volunteered to provide a band for the
parade which will start from the Temple
at 115 Turk street at 7 o'clock. The exer
cises at Metropolitan Temple will begin at
8 p. m., and will consist of addresses and a
literary and musical programme. It is ex
pected that there will be a large attend
ance of the best laboring element in the
City.
THE CROWD CRIED "SCAB."
An Exciting Incident of the Strike
on Post Street.
An exciting incident of the strike oc
curred yesterday afternoon at the Hotel
Savoy, corner of Post ana Powell streets.
Painters Avere at work on the hotel build-
ing and they refused to leave when re
quested by the union delegates.
Soon afterward the situation was re
ported at headquarters, and almost 150
members of the Painters' Union volun
teered to go to the hotel. It was their in
tention to use their united endeavors in a
friendly way toward impressing the work
men. Tbey hoped that by presenting a
solid front an impression would be made
on these non-imion men, but success did
not follow the attempt.
The presence of such a large number of
men naturally attracted a crowd to the
corner of Powell and Post streets. During
the parley the crowd waited patiently, and
when no persuasion could move the work
men repeated criesof "scab" went up from
the street.
"These men were workine for F. A. Jen
nings, who has a sub-contract on the job
from St. Denis," said Committeeraan
Doyle of the Painters' Union last evening.
"There were only threeof them on the iob,
anyhow, so it did not worry us much when
they refused to quit. This is practically
the only job in town that is not tied up by
the union."

MAY DISBAND.
Labor Council Members Consider
Its Utility as Practically Ended.
There is a probability that the Labor
Council will soon be a thing of the past.
At the weekly meeting of the council last
evening a proposition to disband was dis
cussed at length in executive Bession.
Some of the members are convinced that
the necessity for the council is obviated by
tbe recently organized Trades and Labor
Alliance. After a heated discussion the
matter was left to a committee to ascer
tain the views of the various unions and
report next Friday evening.
The Pattern-makers's Association was
admitted to membership in the council,
and John Hill, their duly accredited dele
gate, was seated.
Otto Grassmann of Bakers' Union No.
24 stated that at the convention held the
rirst of the week the bakers had decided to
march with the painters to-night.
The executive committee recommended
that the organizing committee work with
the new union of garment-makers, to the
end that they might be initiated into the
workings of unionism and that dealers
might be induced to accept their products.
A committee from the Iron Holders'
Union, which was appointed to investigate
the sale of convict-made stoves in the
City, reported that negotiations were pend
ing which they believed would result in
the discontinuance of their sale.
J. W. Rose, president of the Painters'
Union, extended an invitation to the
council to occupy seats on the platform at
this evening's session. The invitation was
accepted with applause.
WJll Bury Bertha Bryant.
P-ev. Dr. Elliott, ia whose family Bertha Bry-
ant, who committed suicide in a Post-street
lodging-house, had formerly been a domestic,
called at the Morgue yesterday and took
charge of the body, which will be given a re
spectful burial in a lot at the City Cemetery.
CABALISTIC SIGNS.
A Lottery-Ticket Seller Caught in the
Act by a Policeman in the
Mission.
The â¢cabalistic signs made by canvassers
and others on doors in the Mission have
put the police on their mettle, and a strict
lookout has been kept for any one doing so.
Yesterday afternoon Policeman Smith
saw an old man making marks with b
pencil on the doors of houses in the neigh
borhood of Diamond and Twenty-fourth
streets after he had made a call.
Smith got as close to him as he could,
and when he had ocular demonstration
of the fact placed him under arrest. He
examined the mark and found it was in
the form of the letter "P." The lady of
the house told Smith that the old man
had been selling her a lottery ticket.
Smith took the old man to the Seven
teenth-street station, where he gave the
name of George Peters, t>o years of age.
He admitted that he had been sejjing
lottery tickets and made the mark on the
doors so as to show him that the nouse
was safe to call at in future. He was
booked on the charges of selling lottery
tickets and malicious mischief.
Peters has been a resident of the Mis
sion for a number of years and kept a
fruit-store on Twenty-fourth and Mission
streets, and later on Valencia street.
After giving up the fruit business he
started in to sell lottery tickets.
YOU SHOULD SECURE ONE
While They lust, but It Is Necessary
to Act Promptly.
The evident anxiety to secure one of
those introductory sets of the Encyclo
paedic Dictionary by no means argues that
any large number of homes on the coast
are without such a useful educational ad
junct.
It simply means that those who have an
indifferent dictionary see a chance of se
curing a good one, while those who have a
good one hope to get a better.
For in these days one feels obliged to
keep up to date, and this very quality of
being up to date on all progressive subjects
is justly claimed for the new work.
And the Pacitic Coast Newspaper Syndi
cate believes that, by placing 500 sets of
the book in that many cultured homes,
where it can be compared with other dic
tionaries and cyclopedias, its superiority
will become at once apparent.
At all events, the puhJic shows a keen
interest in the experiment, and is taking
advantage of the opportunity offered to se
cure tbe four volumes which* make up the
work at tbe nominal cost and on the easy
terms of payment which temporarily pre
vail.
But a few days will see the end of this
notable distribution, as the 500 sets have
been going fast and will soon be allotted.
Two things should be borne in mind:
First, that this offer is not confined to San
Francisco, but applies to all sections
reached by the great San Francisco dailies;
and, second, the volumes may be returned
any time "within ten days and money re
funded if they are not found precisely as
represented.
FRIENDS OF CALIFORNIA.

SAYS THEY ARE ONE.
Women Temperance Workers and Suf
fragists Need Not Conflict.
Commenting upon the goneral impres
sion that the Woman's Christian Temper
ance Union convention will not be wel
comed by the woman suffragists, the Paci
fic Ensign, the W. C. T. U. organ, says:
It is to be regretted that the impression has
gotten out that there is an antagonism between
the suffragists and the W. C. T. U. in regard to
homing the National convention of the W. C.
T. U. in San Francisco. While there may be a
difference of opinion in regard to the effect of
the convention, that will not prevent the two
working together harmoniously. This is not a
temperance fight. Did the suffragists expect
to bring tne influence of the temperance peo
ple to bear upon the campaign, an invitation
would have been extended to the National
convention to convene here in October.
AÂ« the time set for holding this gathering Is
in November, after the State election, it proves
that the suffragists are going into the fight
with but one issue, and will stand or fall on
its merits. The justness of the ballot being
granted to woman is their one plea, and they
will not go into any by-paths to join on or to
fight their issues; nor is it their intention to
inquire into the personal belief or status of
any individual. A free and untrammeled bal
lot is what is desired, and all in harmony with
that sentiment will be asked to unite in ad
vancing it and to support it by ballot, be they
"bond or free, Jew or gentile."
Impersonated an Officer.
Alfred Langley, a botler-maker, was arrested
last evening by Officers Collins and Flinn and
detained at the California-street police station
on the charge of impersonating an officer. Lang
ley has been in the habit of visiting the tender
loin districtand after exhibiting a star which
surreptitiously came into his possession he
extorted money from the unfortunate women,
threatening to arrest them on various charges
in case they refused to liberally contribute to
his support. Last night he was caught in the
act and promptly arrested.
Charles A. Mars' Death.
The cases of Daniel Dunn, James Holmes,
William Patee, John Drugan, Michael Shine
and William J. Dowline, striking lathers
charged with the murder of Charles A. Mars,
who died at his home, 765 Harrison street,
Thursday morning, were called in Judge Low's
court yesterday and were continued till March
20, to await the resultof the Coroner's inquest.
Was Not the St rangier.
Upon investigation the weird story circu
lated last evening that the strangler who mur
dered May McDermott and Berthe Paradis had
again made an assault on a woman of the ten
derloin district has proven to be without
foundation.
An Unaccountable Disappearance.
D. Z. Wright left his home in Novato, Marin

EDEN VALLEY COLONISTS
Over ioo Arrive and Will En
gage in Eaising Livestock
in Mendocino.
THOUSANDS MORE TO COME.
A Tract of About 40,000 Acres of Land
Secured for Their Occupancy
by Father Jeram.
The Rev. Father Peter Joseph Jeram,
president of the California Slavonian col
ony, Eden Valley, Mendocino County,
arrived here yesterday, accompanied by
102 people for the colony.
They came from Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Wisconsin and other States. Three
were from Rock Springs, Wyo.' All the
colonists were quartered at the Russ House,
and after lunch went to see the park, Cliff
and other attractions of the City. They
are largely of German, Slavonian and Aus
trian extraction.
All are bound to Eden Valley, where
22,000 acres of land have been mirchased,
and where a bond has been obtained on as
much more. The colonists will conduct
their business on the co-operative plan.
They are practical growers of livestock,
and this will be their specialty in Eden
Valley.
They will raise cattle, hogs and fowls
and, as Father Jeram states, when a 60 per
cent duty is placed on wool they will raise
sheep.
"This is only the beginning of our
colony enterprise," said Father Jeram.
"All the arrangements have been made
for it to become a gigantic success. That
valley up there is to be a new fatherland to
the colonists. We nave got 22,000 acres
there row and have arranged to take a
great deai more. There will be some more
colonists to-morrow and about 125 on Sun
day, and after that they will come along
by hundreds.
"There will be many thousand colonists
before we complete our work. Fully 3000
will be in the valley before the end of the
year."
N. H. Lang of Young & Lang, whose
firm is interested in the lands secured for
the colony, was with Father Jeram. Mr.
Lane recounted that the colony was in
corporated on the basis of $500,000. The
land lies between the north and middle
forks of the Eel River, forty-seven miles
north of Ukiah. It was only recently
thrown open to colonization. Large quan
tities of hardware, groceries and other
supplies have been forwarded for the colo
nists. Of the crowd who arrived yester
day there were 43 men, 25 women and
34 children.
The colonists appear to be very ener
getic, active people.
Jackson's Beautiful Epitaph.
"I contend that no more beautiful epi
taph was ever written than that written by
President Andrew Jackson regarding his
wife," said Captain Sam Donelnon of Ten
nessee, and he took from his pocket-book
a scrap of paper that he has carried for
many years. Captain Donelson is a great
nephew of the wife of Old Hickory, but
everybody will subscribe to the beauty of
the words written in her memory:
"Here lie the remains of Mrs. Rachel
Jackson, wife of President Jackson, who
died Decem ber 22, 1828, aged 6 1 years. Her
face was fair, her person pleasing, her
temper amiable and her heart kind. She
delighted in relieving the wants of her
fellow-creatures and cultivated that divine
pleasure by the most literal and unpre
tending methods. To the poor she was a
benefactor, to the rich an example, and to
the wretched a comforter. Her piety went
hand in hand with ber benevolence,
and she thanked her Creator for being
permitted to do good; a being so eentle
and yet so virtuous slander might wound
but could not dishonor. Even death, when
he tore her from the arms of her husband,
could but transport her to the bosom of
her God." â Pittsburg Dispatch.
Two West Africa love birds, two king
penguins, one Per.-ian gazelle, one puff
adder, one salt-water terrapin, two Indian
jerboas and one Delalande's gecko, among
many other interesting specimens, have
recently been added to the collection at
the Zoological Society Gardens, London.
A Sequent tiratefully Acknowledged.
At the regular monthly meeting of the board
of directors of the German General Benevolent
Society last night a resolution of thanks was
voted to Mrs. Isaac Hecht for the payment of her
late husband's bequest of $2000. Expressions
of the highest esteem and appreciation in
memory of the generous donor were embodied
in the resolution.
Railroad Case Continued.
The case of the Southern Pacific Company

FOR COUNTRY'S SAKE.
AN INDIAN FIGHTER SUFFERS
AGONIES FROM DISEASE.
He Was in the Battle With the Apaches
When Geronimo Was Captured.
From the Press. New York City.
Worn with the exposure of army life on the
frontier and poisoned by the continued drink
ing of alkali water, Joieph Flegauf returned
to Philadelphia eight years ago, broken down
In nealth and unable to do any work.
He served five years with the Ninth United
States Infantry in many a desperate fight with
the Indians in Arizona and other frontier
States and had won an enviable record. In
the fierce conflict when Geronimo, thj famous
chief of the Apaches, was captured, Mr. Fle
gauf was among the brave soldiers who, for
getful of everything but duty, charged upon
the hostile Indians.
Life on the plains sent to an untimely death
many soldiers who were never touched by a
redskin's bullet or arrow, and Mr. Flegauf
came near such a fate as that. A long time
before his time was out he was taken seriously
ill, but he stuck to his post until an honorable
discharge was finally given to him.
When he reached Philadelphia the Indian
fighter was scarcely more than skin and bones,
and for three weeks he lay desperately ill in a
hospital. He felt dizzy, and his stomach felt
as if it had dried up. These symptoms were
accompanied by bloody dysentery, which no
medicine seemed to relieve.
After two years of suffering Mr. Flegauf
came to New York and was treated by several
physicians. These did not agree, some calling
his disease catarrh of the stomach and others
chronic diarrhea.
In speaking to a reporter about his illness
Mr. Flegauf said the doctors helped him, but,
with all the money he spent for advice and
medicine, he was able to work only a small
part of the time. Since moving to his present
home, No. 517 West Forty-second street, in New
Yom, about a year ago, Mr. Flegauf has been
so ill that his voice and hearing almost left
him.
Then all medicines failed, and the sick iran
haa little hope of recovery. At this critical
time Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People
were recommended to Mr. Flegauf, and, almost
as a last hope, he besran taking them.
"The beneficial effect of the medicine was
felt at once," Mr. Fiegauf told the reporter,
"and before I had taken a box I began to eat
with relish. Three boxes made me so much
better that I began work and have been able
to keep at it since, for five months."
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are
not a patent medicine in the sense that name
implies. They were first compounded as a
prescription and used as such in general prac
tice by an eminent physician. So great was
their efficacy that it was deemed wise to place
them within the reach of all. They are now
manufactured by the Dr. Williams' Medicine
Company, Schenectady. N. V., and are sold in
boxes (never in loose form by the dozen or
hundred, and the public are cautioned against
numerous imitations sold in this shape) at 50
cents a box, or six boxes for $2 50, and may be
had of all druggists or direct by mall from Dr.
Williams' Medicine Company.
THE BRONTE MANUSCRIPTS.
Some Treasures in a London Society's
Museum.
The chief treasures in the Bronte So
ciety's museum are among the manu
scripts, which are both numerous and in
trinsically interesting. Round one of
them â the plain, calf-bound volume which
contains the original manuscript of the
first volume of "Jane Eyre" â the whole
exhibition may be considered to
center. It is written in a tiny
hand on the quarto letter-paper in general
use at that day and rills 225 pages. The
date, "March 16, 1847," written at the top
of the opening page, shows that it was not
tne first copy, but a transcript. The first
copy of the novel had, we know, been com
menced seven months before in the chill
ing solitude of a lodging in a back street in
Manchester, whither Charlotte Bronte had
accompanied her poor blind father, who
was about to undergo an operation on his
eyes.
The story was first written in pencil in
little square manuscript books, and thence
transcribed so carefully that in the whole
volume in the exhibition scarcel}' half a
'lozen erasures are to be found. To Lon
don it went in the early summer, and after
wandering backward and forwarded among
different publishersâ rejected and proba
bly unread â it went in August to Messrs.
Smith, Elder & Co., was accepted and made
its appearance in the following October.
Geonre Smith, the veteran head of the firm,
the history of which would be almost
a history of the best modern English liter
ature, now lends the book to the society,
and with it the first volume of the manu
script of "Villette." This extends to 272
pages, and is probably the first and only
copy. Corrections are more numerous,
and there are several excisions of sentences
and long passages, not merely deleted with
the pen, but cut entirely out'of the paper,
leaving a hole of larger or smaller size in
the leaf. Throughout the manuscript the
name of Lucy Snowe is written as Lucy
Frost, the alteration having been made in
proof.â Good Words.
The product of the claj^-working in
dustries of the United States in 1894 was of
an estimated value of over $65,000,000, of
which bricks represented a little more
than one-half. Of the total value the State
of Ohio produced nearly one-sixth.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
This is the day you leave orders for The
Sunday Call.
There is a big chance yet that the ex
pedition up the Nile will end up a tree.
The failure of Kentucky to elect a Sena
tor *hook the country a little bit, but it is
all right now.
While the goldbugs were looking to see
the silver sun get in the west behold it has
risen in the east.
Democracy is still in doubt whether
Cleveland will come to the front this year
or hire a substitute.
Bayard may not apologize, but he will
never talk again without first taking a
sober second tbougtit.
The Southern Pacific Company can pay
its debts, ought to pay them, and should
be made to pa; them.
Missouri Democracy wearied but not ex
hausted proposes to go to Chicago shout
ing for Bland for President.
If Vanderbilt and Depow are looking for
a good opening for capital they are com
ing to the right p!a cc to find it.
The only way to close the contest ovÂ«r
the Pacific roads debt is to* foreclose the
mortgage and shut out the monopoly.
There will be no more trouble with the
Pacific roads when the Government nas
turned the rascals out of the management.
The train-robber is shot in his tracks,
but the fellow who steals a whole railroad
is allowed all the time he wishes to nego
tiate.
Whiie the Junta boys are having their
razzle-dazzle the Buckley fellows are con
cocting a dose for them that will sober
them up in the morning.
Now that the Bayard roa?t has been well
done the next work for the Congressional
cook is to stir up the syndicate bond deal
and get the soup ready for Grover.
That Huntington swindled Uncle Sam
once is a sign that Huntington is a knave,
but if he swindles him again it will be a
sign that Uncle Sam is sometimes a fool.
Since the City hag made Van Ness
avenue a boulevard the property-owners
ought to feel willing to decorate it with
shade trees and make it a thing of beauty.
A refunding bill that would prolong the
monopoly would be no victory for it, but
only a means of prolonging a fight which
in the end is snre to be won by the people.
Protection, reciprocity and bimetallism
are thrqe planks that make a platform
broad enough for all Republicans to stand
on, with plenty of room besides for the in
dependent voters. â¢
That Uncle Sam nas learned a lesson
from his experience with the Pacific roads
is made evident by a provision in the
Nicaragua canal bill requiring that two
thirds of the board of directors shall be
appointed by the Government.
The open antagonism of the McKinley
men to tbe Cullom movement in his own
Stale may be good politics, and then again
it may be what the Chicago Inter Ocean re
fprred to the other day when it spoke of
some candidates having fool friends.
Among the minor items of political news
that may have a bijr significance is a re
port from New York that an anti-Platt
meeting of Mugwump Republicans called
for the purpose of protesting against the
boss did not draw a crowd big enough to
fill a back parlor at the Windsor Hotel.
As Senator Chandler is reported to have
stated recÂ«ntly that the Senate places at
the disposal of each Senator four persona
who are paid by the Government an aggre
gate amount in salaries of $482,000 a year,
it would seem the fashion of calling it a
rich man's cltib has some foundation in
fact.
During the first eighteen months of its
operation the revenues of the Gorman
tariff have been $75,000,000 less than the
running expenses of the Government and
about $100,000,000 less than the revenues
derived from the first eighteen months of
the McKinley tariff. Thats the Demo
cratic record.
Although much is said about the relative
strength the various candidates will have
in the St. Louis convention, cautious stu
dents of the situation declare no safe esti
mate can be made before the end of April,
by which time twenty-one States will have
elected delegates and the party sentiment
will be pretty well made known.
When in a speech in Congress Tom Reed
said, "To insure our growth in civilization
we must not only have wages as high as
they are now but constantly and steadily
increasing," the Republicans applauded
heartily but the Democrats were silent.
The incident is a good pointer for work'ng
men wiio are in doubt how to vote this
year.
The way in which free trade affects the
farmer i.Â« shown by the fact that of twenty
staple articles of farm produce there were
imported into this country in 1894 under
the Republican tariff about $65,000,000
worth, but of the same products there
were imported in 1895 under the Gorman
tariff $134,000,000 worth, being a loss to
American farmers of nearly $70,000,000 of
American money in one year.
ENFORCE THE LAW.
During the whole of the prolonged con
troversy over the settlement of tfce debts
due to the Government by the Pacific
railroads the advocates of the refunding
scheme have advanced no argument in
support of it save the one that in no other
way can the Government recover either
the principal or the interest on which the
roads have defaulted.
Reduced to simple terms the argument
for refunding is that the Government must
yield to the demands of the monopoly or
lose all that it has at stake. Ordinarily
the creditor has an advantage over the
debtor, but in this case all ordinary rules
are reversed. The debtor assumes to defy
the creditor to collect the debt. The law
is mocked at. The Government is inso
lently challenged to recover If it can the
money which the subsidized roads have
taken from it. This defiance is not
couched in diplomatic terras. It is an
nounced boldly. "If you expect to get
back what we owe you," say the directors
of the defaulting roads to the Government
and the people, "then you must wait our
leisure, you must reduce the rate of inter
est on the debt, you must set aside the
laws you have made, you must continue
our monopoly and by refundine the debt
allow us at least fifty years more in which
to decide whether we will ever pay it or
not."
In the face of an argument of thia kind
Congress should not hesitate a moment.
If the Government cannot collect the debt
now it can never collect it at all. Refund
ing the debt for fifty years would simply
increase the amount due by the defaulters
without in any way increasing the pros
pects of recovering any portion of it.
Huntington and his colleagues have been
trusted once and they have betrayed the
trust. They have made no effort to repay
principal or interest of their obligations.
They have built themselves palaces in the
City and villas by the sea. They have
allied their families by marriage with the
princes of Europe aud bestowed dowries
upon the brides with a prodigal magnifi
cence. They have maintained a thousand
extravagances and at the same time made
an ostentatious display of philanthropy
when the C3price seized them. They have
never paid their debts, however, nor ever
tried to, nor is there any reason to believe
they ever thought of doing so.
Railroads whose revenues have been suf
ficient to pile up the colossal fortunes
while permitting all the luxuries of the
members of the Southern Pacific Com
pany can certainly pay off the debt due
the Government if they are economically
administered. There are abundant evi
dences that if rascals were removed from
the management of the roads, the income
to be derived from a Witimate business
would sooner or later paj all that is due
to the Government anil leave a good profit
besides. This seems to be the opinion of
the Vanderbilts and tne Goulds, and they
certainly know something of railroads.
The course to be followed by Congress is
therefore plain, whether considered from
the poiut of view of expediency or of duty.
It is summed up in the demand of the
people: Enforce the law, foreclose the
mortgage, turn the rascals out.
KEEPING UP ITS COURAGE.
A Democratic contemporary professes to
be delighted with the prospect of the
nomination of McKmley by the St. Louis
convention, asserting that while his nomi
nation may be assured the election of the
author of the "Tariff of Abominations" is
quite another matter.
We have all heard of the boy who, pass
ing a graveyard, whistles to keep his
courage up, and our contemporary re
minds us very forcibly of that boy. Sup
pose that instead of McKinley the nominee
of the National Republican Convention
should be Reed, or Morton, or Allison, or
Cameron, or any other Republican, can
the Examiner imagine for a moment that
Presidential candidates can stand upon
any except a protectionist platform?
Governor â  McKinley is associated inti
mately with protection to American labor
and American industries, not* because he
is any better protectionist than thousands
of his party, but because he was the chair-
man of the Ways and Means Committee of
the House of Representatives which
formulated the tariff measure known
familiarly as tbe McKinley bill.
Whether William McKinley or another
be the nominee of the St. Louis convention
is a matter of perfect indifference so far as
the question of protection is concerned.
The people of the United States have had
enough and more than enough of free
trade, aa thinly disguised in the Wilson
bill, with its accompanying train of deficit
in the treasury, bond issues to meet cur
rent expenses of the Government and deal
ings with toreign money-holding syndi
cates. They prefer to return to a policy
under which the National credit became
the admiration of the world and by the
operation of which there was created a
surplus in the National Treasury, even
though such surplus did alarm Grover
Cleveland in December, 1887.
Of course no one really believes that our
Democratic contemporary entertains even
a hope of the buccess of its party at the
coming Presidential election. To tell the
truth, Presidential timber is pretty scarce
in the Democratic camp. Cleveland is out
of the question, Carlisle is an impossi
bility, Whitney will not consent to be a can
didate, Boies of lowa is no longer a favorite
son, Campbell of Ohio cannot make the
race, and Morgan of Alabama, the ablest
man of the party, is handicapped by geo
graphical considerations. There will be
somebody, no doubt, who will accept the
empty honor of a nomination, for some
times it is better, in a political sense, to
have run and lost than never to bave run
at all, but the long odds are that the
nominee of the St. Loui9 convention, who
ever he may be, will be the next President
of the United States and it is certain that
he will be a protectionist.
PEBBY TBOUBLES ENDED.
The decision by the Supreme Court that
the Harbor Commission has a large dis
cretion under the act authorizing it to con
struct a ferry building does away with all
the annoying obstacles which have hin
dered the board, and now everything is
clear saiiing. For some time the progress
of this improvement has been so delayed
by trivial interferences that its importance
has nearly dropped out of sight. It is
most unfortunate that every act of the
Legislature concerning matters of public
interest has to be tested in the courts be
fore it can become operative, but this ex
pensive and annoying means of establish
ing or overturning acts seems to be a
necessary evil so long as the Legislature
chooses to make laws inadequately con
sidered and imperfectly drawn.
Now that the work of construction will
pioceed henceforward without interrup-
tion, it is proper to ponder its meaning
and canvass means for developing the
highest usefulness of the building. It will
be a handsome structure and an ornament
to the City, but beyond that lie questions
affecting the commerce of this port and
the co-operation of the City with the
State. It will no: be sufficient to regard
the new lerry building merely as an im

provement on the wretched sheds that
have served for so many years. The supe
rior facilities which it will offer will make
it the center of activities bearing the
closest relation to the best interests of the
State and City.
Two of the most important matters that
are now under consideration by the lead-
ing commercial bodies of the City are a
reduction of the burdens now resting upon
our shipping and an appropriation from
Congress for the removal of submerged
rocks which are a serious menace to navi
gation. These two matters should be
urged with all possible vigor. Neglect of
them serves only to cripple the efficiency
of the ocean as a highway for the distri
bution of our products and to strengthen
the hold of a railroad monopoly on our
commerce and industries.
These are matters which affect the wel
fare of the State. The City itself will ac
quire from the splendid structure an inde
pendent set of responsibilities. One will
be the proper treatment of Market street
as the highway from the ferry to all the
subsidiary thoroughfares penetrating
every section of town. A good pavement
is required, and an elimination of super
fluous streetcar tracks would be highly
advantageous. It is by no mean 3 too early
to make preparations for these improve
ments. They would be followed by many
others throughout the business section of
the City. Other matters springing from
the new building will readily present
themselves. It would be an everlasting
reproach to the City not to make the most
of this superb improvement which the
State is making.
THE DEBSIS APPROPBIATION.
The communication addressed by Tirey
L. Ford to the House Committee on Rivers
and Harbors in response to a request from
the committee for a statement relative to
the wishes of the people of California on
the subject of a Government appropria
tion of $250,000 for the construction of
debris-impounding works places the mat
ter in a considerably broader light than it
has been generally assumed to possess.
After reciting the familiar history of the
legislation which has been taken on the
subject, including the act of Congress of
March 1, 1893 (the Camin*Â»tti act), inviting
the co-operation of California, and the
California legislative act of the same year
appropriating ?250,000 for impounding
works on condition that Congress makes
an appropriation in the same amount for
that purpose, Mr. Ford's communication
makes the following statement:
"This committee must bear in mind that
the damage heretofore done to the rivers
in California through the flow of detritus
from the mountains has been from several
causes. Nature is continually washing
the mountains down into the valleys, and
this has been greatly accelerated since the
advent of civilization. The denudation of
the mountain sides of the heavy forests
that formerly grew upon them has per
mitted the' soil to become loosened and
thus more rapidly wash into the canyons.
The grazing of vast herds of cattle and
sheep and other stock upon the mountain
sides has also accelerated the washing
away of the soil. Farming and gardening
have added somewhat, and mining has
also done its share toward carrying debris
into the canyons and rivers. No one cause
is wholly to blame. It is impossible to
take care of the debris resulting from one
cause without at the same time taking care
of the debris resulting from all causes.
The proposition is to impound this debri9
at convenient places in the lower foothills
and in the canyons where nature seems to
have provided places especially adapted
to the purpose and thus relieve the rivers
from the annual danger arising from the
melting snows and freshets at spring
time."
This is a broad and generous statement
of the present condition. The communi
cation further declares that it is a theory
that the Government should take care of
its livers and shows that for its outlay the
Government is to Tequire that the hy
draulic miners availing themselves of the
benefits of the impounding works shall
pay 3 per cent of their gross income for the
privilege. It is further pointed out that
the appropriation, instead of having the
effect of fostering a particular industry,
will not only make hydraulic mining pos
sible, but will prevent injury to the rivers
and lower farming lands by checking the
flow of detritus that has already accu
mulated and that is constantly gaining
volume from various sources. Such a
presentation of the case Eeems altogether
reasonable. In view of these facts and the
favorable recommendation of the Govern
ment engineers appointed to investigate
the matter, it is difficult to see how Con
gress can consistently withhold the de
sired appropriation.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The feature of The Sunday Call of to
morrow that will first impress the eye will
be a picture of the young ladies of the
High School leaving the buildine at the
close of their day's work. It is a picture
attractive not only because it represents a
typical scene in the daily life of our City,
but aa an example of the excellence of
newspaper illustration on this coast.
The literary features of the number will
be marked by the diverse variety of the
subjects treated and the high degree of
excellence of the several articles. Promi
nent among these is a story of the struggle
of a woman against the hard fortunes of
life in Nebraska, it is in truth something
more than a story, and to the reader will
appear not as realism, but as reality, The
effect of the pathos and of the resemblance
to an incident of actual life is increased by
the title, which is embodied in the sug
gestive words, "She Was My Sister."
A charming pastoral suited to the spring
time will be found in an article by Miss Ade
line Knapp descriptive of early wild flowers
and particularly of the "Wake-Robin." A
sketch of a widely different nature but of
equal interest to the general reader will be
found in the narrative of the experiences
of a Whitehall boatman of San Francisco
under the title of "Around the World in a
Whitehall."
The series of Lighthouse Stories which
has been running in The Sunday Call for
some time is continued to-morrow in
an account of the lighthouse at Twin
Brothers Islands. W. C. Morrow con
tributes the chief literary feature of the
number in a story of mystery and tragedy,
"The Garrulous Typewriter," in which
are illustrated some of those complex phe
nomena of life which make up the world
of the supernatural.
The regular departments of the paper,
including fashions, literature, science, so
ciety, childhood's realm, etc., are filled
with an entertaining miscellany of original
and selected matter. It goes without say
ing that the news of the day will be found
in full. The Call is the only morning pa
per in the City which receives United Press
dispatches and is therefore one that must
be read by all who wish to know all the
news.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Sheriff A. C. Bnsch of Sierra County, who has
lived in the mountains of the north for forty
years now, mined and kept store and brought
bold border bandits to justice, is at the Russ.
The Sheriff has grown bigger in recent years,
though at the same time the snow has some
what touched his beard.
It is only recently that he became a Sheriff.
For a long while he conducted a general mer
chandise business at Sierra City, and he is yet
interested in it. Then he was pushed forward
for politics.
"Not a Democrat had been elected," said he,
"and it looked impossible for them to elect me.
for it is a very strong Republican county.
However, I was really elected by a majority of

about 150, and the second time I ran I beat
my opponent two to one. lam serving my sec
ond term now.
"It is rather bright and hopeful looking in
Sierra now, though the snow has been very
light. Last, year there were three hydraulics
at work in Sierra, and this yÂ«ar four more
were started up. They were all enjoined under
the anti-debris act, but since then they have
all built dams, and now will start up again.
"There is a good deal of Interest in mining
there. Lots of new companies hare been or
ganized. The old Alaska mine has beeD, re
opened and is employing over thirty men. It
is expected that the Bonanza mine and its 40
--stamp mill will start soon.
"There is a San Frnncisco syndicate that is
buying all the mines in front of the Keystone.
The syndicate Is going to run a tunnel more
than two miles long through these properties.
It is expected that three or four pay veins will
be opened. '
"On various mines on which work is being
projected the ore is showing up well. The
Bald Mountain extension is one of these, and
the North Fork and South Fork at F rest City.
"There has also been a strike recently in the
Plumbago mine. It is very good ore and there
is a good deal of it."
Sheriff Busch intends leaving for home to
morrow. He says more snow is badly needed,
but thinks it may yet fall. In 1858, after
April 15, he saw no less than seven feet of new
snow at Sierra City.
A POSTER ROMANCE.
She posed within a poster gown
Beneath a poster tree;
A poster background wiggled down
Into a poster sea.
I mustered up a poster smile,
And said: -'Oh, queerest lass,
If you decide it worth your while
Our troth shall come to pass."
She viewed me with a poster frown
And cried: "It cannot be â
You have no weird, grotesque renownâ
Too plain you are for me."
I wildly dashed upon my wheel;
I scorched it here and there,
Collided, spilled, and with a squeal
I heard my garments tear.
All mud and blood and rags I ride
To her who did me fling;
She drooped upon my neck and sighed:
"Ah, now you're just the thing."

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
POPULISTS AND THE TARIFF.
Their Demand for Free Silver Coinage
Means Protection.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Your intelligent readers will readily perceive
that Populists are profoundly interested in the
news of to-day (March 20) from Washington of
a conference oetween the Pennsylvania manu
facturers and the Republican silver Senators
for the purpose of linking together the two is
sues of bimetallism and protection as "an in
divisible issue before the country" in the pres
ent political campaign. Populists have all
along been amazed at the apparent subserv
iency of the great manufacturing and indus
trial interests of the Eastern States to the gold
mongers of New York and Europe. It has
been the constant cry of the Populists tnat the
industrial interests of the country wereutterly
opposed to the interest! and purposes of the
gold-mongers, but protectionist manufactur.
ers, assuming that Populists were free-traders,
have disregarded the plea of tne Populists for
free coinage as only a Populist cry.
Forelook ing advocates of the free coinage of
silver at the old and always safe ratio ot 16
to 1 have continually pointed out the in
evitably disastrous consequences to our indus
trial interests (not alone of the farmer and
cotton-grower, but of the manufacturer as
well) of ignoring the silver issue and permit
ting the gold-mongers to rule the country; but
while the farmers and planters have practi
cally all become aggressive advocates of free
silver coinage, so great has been the devotion
of the manufacturers to the "party of protec
tion" that they have failed to see that it did
not protect them, while it helplessly exposed
them to their most dangerous competitors, the
much despised and berated countries ou a
"silver basis," supposed to be the last and low
est state of inferior civilization, according to
the wisdom of gold-mongers.
It remained for Japan, China and Mexico, to
whose low estate we were doomed to come, the
gold-mongers tell us, if we venture to restore
ihe free coinage of silver â it has remained for
these despised countries to open the eyes of
our manufacturers to the fact that they, as
well as tne farmers and cotton-planters, are to
be ruined if our great financial guides and
philosophers. Senator Sherman and President
Cleveland, are permitted to keep this country
on a gold basis. It U admitted that the awak
ening of these manufacturers has been some
what rude and unwelcome, but 100 per cent
profit to these much-berated silver-basis coun
tries has led our manufacturers to open their
eyes and see, as President Dornan of the Manu
facturers' Club of Philadelphia expressed it at
the conference in Washington yesterday, "that
tariff duties cannot be made high enough to
protect our manufacturers if our country re
mains on a gold basis."
To an observant Populist, who eagerly scans
the signs of the times, the 19th day of March,
1896, is to become a conspicuous milestone in
the forward march of the party of protection
in the present campaign. It must be apparent
to the least thoughtful observer that the Ohio
platform, as formulated by Major McKinlev
ten days before this Washington conference of
manufacturers and silver Senators, is not ac
ceptable to the industrial interests of the coun
try. Indeed, it is openly indicated by the lead
ing spirits in the conference that the. Ohio
platform will not do, and that no alliance with
the dominant gold power of Wall street will
be tolerated. It is safe to assume, if a Populist
can come anywhere near guessing the portents
of the hour, that tne "Ohio idea" is acceptable
to the magnates of Wall street and to their
allies of the gold-inoneering class in Europe.
If so, the "Ohio idea" must be greatly modified
and become an explicit declaration in favor of
free coinage of silver at 16 to 1. or there will be a
conflict in the Republican party quite like that
which has broken out in the Democratic party.
But how would such a modification be received
I by gold-mongers?
Heretofore it has been the policy of the Pop
ulists as a party to ignore the tariff issue, and
individuals have had absolute liberty to hold
and cherish any views they please. There are
protectionists as strong as "McKinley and free
traders as rank as Henry George in the Popu
list party all over the country who work side
by side in the utmost harmony; but I think
the conviction is general among Populists that
the tariff issue should be taken out of politics
â  entirely and placed in the hands of a great
| non-partiaan National tribunal, like that of
the Supreme Court in dignity and character,
except that the members shall be chosen by a
direct vote of the people, each State to have at
least one representative. As the tariff is purely
a business matter it should be placed in the
hands of business men of the highest attain
ments and character, who should hold office as
long as United States Senators, if not longer,
and one-half of the members should be hold
over. The interests of trade and manufacture
would thus never be subject to sudden and rad
ical changes with a change in the administra
tion. The temptation as it now exists to
use the tariff issue for partisan advantage
would then cease forever. So far as I know
the protectionist and free-trade Populists are
now ready to accept this disposition of the
much buffeted and mischief-breeding tariff
question as an issue in politics.

LADY'S WRAPPER OR TEA GOWN.
A semi-fitted wrapper is a most comfortable
garment, and is preferred by many to a tight
or entirely loose gown. The one shown here
hangs in graceful lines from a yoke back and
front. These portions are rounded at the sides
and further fitted by an under-arm gore. The
sleeve Is unlined, making it altogether an
ideal model for washable fabrics. The same
design serves for handsome tea gowns. One
seen was of blue crepon. The yoke was of
white satin covered with creamy guipure lace.
The epaulettes were pf blue satin ribbon. A
bow of the same ribbon, six inches wide, joined
a wide-spreading bow at the top of the-fullness
in front.
A gown of pink Dresden silk with narrow
lines of black satin two inches apart bad black
satin yoke covered with chiffon. Around the
epaulettes, wnich were of the silk, was a nar
row pleating of chiffon. A black satin ribbon
was brought forward from the back of the
under-arm pore and partially confined the full
ness a little below the waist line in front.
Chiffon ruffles adorned the sleeves.
A gown of dimity in stripes of green and
white had green ribbou epaulettes, with a
folded r\ol]ar nf the same.
A plain white lawn gown was exquisitely
dainty, having epaulettes of lawn with inser*
tions of narrow Valenciennes set it. A ruffle of
lace to match finished the edges. The ruffles on
the sleeves were of lawn and insertion. A
white ribbon with* rose-colored flounces and a
tiny black satin cdxc formed a folded collar
and bow with long ends at the lower edge of
yoke in front.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Ship Lyndhurst Libeled on
Her Arrival From
Hongkong.
STEAMERS COLLIDE IN A FOG.
All the Ferry Contracts Signed at
Lastâ lron Work to Begin
Immediately.
The long overdue British ship Lyrd
hurst, Captain Martin, arrived yesterday
169 days from Hongkong. The cause of
her delay of over two months was owing
to a stop at Auger, Java, for repairs,
having received damages during stormy
weather. She sailed from that port about
December 10, and her run of 100 days
across the Pacific was uneventful. On
February 23 Daniel Purviost, a seaman
and native of England, aged 30 years, died
from natural causes and was buried at sea.
It appears that the Lyndburst's storms
did not end with her entrance into har
bor, for the anchor was not down when
she was boarded by a United States Mar
shal. His warrant was libel papers from
the firm at Auger that repaired the ship.
Vpon the completion of the work Captain
Martin objected to the charges, which
were $11,000. He finally cut short all de
bate over the matter by â¢ spreading the
canvas ana sailing his good ship away.
Bnt the submarine cable was the swifter

The steamer Noyo collided with the
steamer Pasadena off Fort Brape eariv
yesterday morning. The Xoyo, which left
this port Thursday morning, was proceed
ing northward slowly in the fog, when the
Pasadena was suddenly sighted clo;-e
aboard, bound from Eureka to San Pedro.
She struck the Noyo a glancing blow close
to the stem, badly damaging that portion
of the hull. The Pasadena also received
gome damage, but not being in any danger
proceeded on her way. The Noyo arrived
at Fort Bragg, where she will receive tem
porary repairs. Both vessels had large
passenger lists, and what might have been
a serious disaster was averted by the cau
tion of the two captains in moving slowly
in the fog.
The Pasadena came into port late last
night leaking. Six planks had been
started on the starboard side.
At the meeting of the Harbor Commis
sioners yesterday the contract of the
wrought-steel work for the new ferry build
ing was awarded to the Risdon Iron
Works for $188,000. President Taylor of
the company asked for lurther aehiy be
fore signing the papers, but this was
strongly opposed by Commissioner Cole,
who stated that he wanted to see the work
started upon the building. The contracts
were then signed, and this ended all the
preliminaries necessary before the con
struction begins. President Taylor stated
to the board that he will make a showing
within the next ten days.
A petition was received asking that a
new wharf be built on Tulare street, from
Kentucky to Massachusetts, adjoining
Islais Creek channel. The petition was
tabled, as the commission did not think
me needs of commerce at present called
for a wharf there, and also because there
were no funds for the construction.
A communication was received from the
Chamber of Commerce relative to the im

The steamship City of Rio Janeiro,
which was driven back to Honolulu from

across the ocean.
To-morrow the Naval Battalion will

to explore the monitor. Tne officers and
men of the reserve will be in full uniform
ami the strict discipline of a man-of-war
â will prevail on board. In a short time the
armories on shore will be given up and all
the property of the battalion removed to
the Camanche. This will save the ex
pense of several hundred dollars a quarter,
which will be used in a fund to make the
old craft shipshape.

WHY THREE STOOD OUT
George H. Sanders Tells About
the Jury in the Case Against
LeoD R. Meyers.
Previous Good Reputation of the De
fendant and Contradictory Testi
mony Caused a Disagreement.
George H. Sanders of the architect firm
of Wright & Sanders, was one of the jurors
in the case of the People against Leon R.
Meyers, charged with an infamous crime.
Mr. Sanders was asked last night to state
why the jury disagreed.
He said he would not admit whether he
was with the minority or the majority,
but that the three jurors who stood out
for acquittal were influenced in their judg
ment by the fact that the girls who testi
fied for the prosecution had made contra
dictory statements, and by the further
fact that Meyers had always borne a good
reputation before this affair occurred.
These two facts, taken together, caused the
three jurors to discredit the testimony
and to give the defendant the benefit of
the doubt, as they were bound to do under
I their oaths.
The jury stood at first five for acquittal
and seven for conviction. ' Then a compro
mise verfliet was agreed upon by the seven
and by two of the rive, leaving the jury
three for acquittal and two for conviction.
With reference to trie statement that
Mr. Sanders had been employed by Meyers
ior many years to draw designs for marble
work, Mr. Sanders said that he never
worked for Meyers and never drew any
designs for him. The only business rela
tions, if such they could be called, that
had ever existed between them consisted !
in the firm of Wright & Sanders having j
drawn the plans for and superintended
work done under contract by Meyers for
other parties, who had engaged Wright &
Sanders to draw the plans.
"I made that statement in court," con
tinued Mr. Sanders, "because I wanted to
be excused for servinc on the jury. The
District Attorney would have challenged
me only for the fact that he had exhausted
all his peremptory challenges. I told the
Judge I did not think I was a proper man
to be placed on the jury, but the JudÂ«e
took n\e in hand and said, 'When you
weigh the evidence can you under your
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1596.
oath do so impartially?' 'I think I can,' I
said, and I was accepted as a juror."
GRAND JURY SESSION.
>mmunf cation From the Fire Depart
mentâClose Watch on Poolselling.
Only one witness was heard at the regu
lar session of the Grand Jury yesterday
afternoon. One hour's time was required
for B. B. Haskell to tell the jury all about
a partnership /accounting suit in Judge
Hunt's department of the Superior Court.
The jury did not find an indictment, and
perhaps the finding of one may not be
necessary. The report of the referee in
the proceedings has not yet been made to
the court.
While the jury was in session a com
munication was received from Chief Sul
livan of the Fire Department. The docu
ment gives the location of all the engine
houses ana shops of the department and
other information which may serve 8S a
guide for Edward Malley, A. F. Price and
P. F. Butler, the Grand Jury committee
on Fire Department affairs.
It is believed that the jurors had under
consideration for some time yesterday the
fact which was presented to them that
poolselling is still conducted at several
places on Leidesdorff street while a dcci-

sion is pending in Police Judge Low's
court.
The authorities rupposed that Judge
Wallace's recent decision setded the con
troversy, and that the poolmen without
further resistance in the courts would close
their "commission" houses. The selling
of pools therefore, while .ludze Low was
revolving in his mind some other ques
tions of law. was taken as a hint that the
poolsellers had resolved to reopen the
campaign.
IS ALMOST SUICIDE
Nicholas Claussen Pleaded Guilty
to Murder in the First
Degree.
His Plea Was Finally Withdrawn
and He Will Go to Trial on
April i.
Nicholas Claussen nearly drew the noose
around his neck in Judge Wallace's court
yesterday by pleading guilty to murder in
the first degree.
Claussen shot his wife on February 25 at
their home at 37 Everett street. It was a
particularly cold-blooded murder, and
when questioned about it Claussen' said he
had killed the woman for fun. He was
examined in the Police Court and was held
to answer. He came up for arraignment
before Judge Wallace yesterday morning,
and he nearly settled the case for himself
without the help of a jury.
The information was read to him and he
was asked to plead. "Guilty," he said.
Court, counsel and spectators were aston
ished at the plea, for it meant that the
court must sentence him to death, and it
seemed more like suicide than anything
else. He was asked to repeat his plea,
and again the prisoner pleaded guilty.
Then Judge Wallace appointed John J.
Carroll to look out for the prisoner's inter
ests, but the plea was the same and it was
entered.
Colonel o' Byrne then rose as a friend of
the court and asked that the plea be not
entered as gailty. He said that claussen
naa probably mistaken the serious import
of his plea and that he should Jike a
chance to speak to the prisoner and ex
plain the situation to him. Claussen was
asked by the court if he understood the
information which had been read to him,
and he said he had. Then he was asked if
he knew the significance of his plea and the
results which would follow, and said yes,
he did; but Colonel O'Byrne went over
and held an earnest conversation with
him and /he evidently found he did not
understand the situation so well as he
thought he did. The result was that he
asked the court to allow him to withdraw
the plea and enter one of not guiity and
this was permitted.
Colonel O'Byrne. much to his disgust,
was then appointed to defend the prisoner.
Clausaen s" trial was sector April 1.
THE CONTEST UNDECIDED.

KILLED BY A SHIP COOK
Captain Dreyer of the Lyman D.
Foster Stabbed in the
Back.
WAS A COLD-BLOODED MURDER.
After Being Reprimanded the Cooly
Sought to Revenge Himself
at Once.
Those that go down to the sea in ships
hold their lives in their hands, but their
fate does not come on all occasions as a
result of the elements. Many a sailor has
lost his life at the bands of a revengeful
shipmate when out furling the royals or
close-reering the topsails. Time and again
it has been recorded that the braces have
teen let go and the swinging yard has
plunged a man into eternity. On every
occasion it has been the sailor who has got
the worst of it, while the captain and
ofiicefrs as a general rule got the entire
blame.
The tables have been tamed, however,
and the relatives of Captain Phil Dreyer
are now mourning his loss. A more das
tardly crime was never committed at sea.
The captain had occasion to reprimand the
steward, and the latter seized the oppor
tunity when the master was at dinner to
plunge a carving-knife into his back. Cap
tain Dreyer died, and the steward is now
under arrest.
The four-masted schooner Lvman D.
Foster sailed from San Francisco about
the latter part of November last. Captain
'Phil" Dreyer was in command and C. G.
Linn, a halt-breed Chinese, was cook and
steward. For an assistant he hail Thomas
Gertzen, another half-breed, who acted as
cabin boy.
Neither Linn nor Gertzen had ever been
in trouble before, and both had served 0:1
the American vessel Topgallant. Neither
wore queues, and both claimed to be Na
tive Sons of the (iolden West. When the
Lyman D. Foster arrived ai Shanghai and
the two Chinese were arrested for the
murder of the captain they claimed the
protection of the American flap, and it
was given them. It was a cold-blooded
affair, however, and one of the men is sure
to hang.
When the Foster left San Francisco she
hail a crew of fourteen all told aboard.
At Belliogtuun IJny she loaded lumber for
Shanghai and sailed last December. All
went weil for a time, but Linn and the
captain did not get along well together.
The Chinese was derelict in his duty and
frequently had to be reprimanded*. On
February 25 matters came to a climax.
The captain pointed out certain shortcom
ings in the work of the Chinese and the
latter took the first opportunity to re
venge himself. As he was serving the
skipper he leaned over his back and
grasping the carving-knife stubbed Dreyer
between the shoulders.
A struggle ensued, but the wounded
master was no match for the infuriated
Chinese and was soon overcome. When
Mate L. Anderson and others of the crew
broke into the cabin Captain Dreyer was
dead and the Cuinese was sitting at the
table gazing upon the corpse. His mind
was completely gone and he had to be
placed in irons to prevent further trouble.
Wiiether his craze was temporary or not
remains to be seen, but that will cer;ainly
be his plea when the case comes to trial in
the Consular Court In Shanghai.
Captain Dreyer was well known in San
Francisco, and no one will be more "missed
on 'Change than he. For years he was
master of the schooner Reporter, and a
fe.w years ago W. G. Hall of Port Blakeley
built the Lyman D. Foster for him. The
schooner was named alter a son of S. Fos
ter, the wholesale grocer, an.d is considered
one of the handsomest four- masted crafts
afloat. Captain Dreyer leaves a widow
and four c ..iluren, all of whom live in Al
araeda. It was late in the aiternpon be
fore any one could summon up courage
enough to inform them of the tragedy.
When the news was finally broken to Mrs.
Dreyer her grief was pitiable to behold.
The remains of her husband will be em
balmed and brought to San Francisco for
burial. '

A Small Judgment.
Frank C. Goiville has been given a judgment
against the Southern Pacific for $1 15. He
bought a ticket to Redding about a year ago,
but the conductor after taking it up thought
it was only for Red Bluff and he demanded
Colville's fare from Red Bluff to Redding.
Colville paid it tinder protest and afterward
ho brought suit for $200 damages for breach
of contract and $99 damages to his feelings,
besides the $1 15 overcharge. The conductor
had been courteous all through, aud as the
railroad had acknowledged the mistake and
offered to refund, damages were denied the
plaintiff. He was awarded the amount of the
overchaige.
PIANOFOETE RECITAL.
Two Young Girls Distinguish Them
selves at an Entertainment.
A pleasant musicale was given last night
at the Association Auditorium, under the
auspices of the Hawthorn Society. Mi?s
Elsie Cellarius, a little nine- year-old girl,
especially distinguished herself. She
played Handel's "Harmonious Black
smith" with good execution and wonder
ful facility, considering her age. The
piano passages were rendered in a particu
larly pretty and graceful manner.
Miss Aimee Cellarius, a young girl a few
years her sister's senior, played a "Rondo
Brilliante," by Weber, and selections by
Mozart and Bach. She played with a
crisp, clear touch and showed a fair appre
ciation of the different styles required for
the compositions of such diverse masters.
Her Weber number was particularly good.
In the selections by Mozart ami Bacn
Miss Cellarius was accompanied on an
other piano by Abe Sunderland.
Hugo Mansfeldt won warm applause for
his playing of a number of classical piano
forte sblos, and Mrs. George H. Parry and
Hugo Mansfeldt played a duet, an air with
variations by Beethoven, arranged by
Saint Saens.
"A MAN AND HIS MOTHER"
Rabbi Voorsanger Makes Pro
test Against the New
Woman.
Declares Against Innovations That
Hay Shake the Foundation
of Society.
"Woe betide any woman or class of
women who sh'.ll change in any wise the
maternal relation. The mother must re
main as she is."
So said Rabbi Voorsanger in his lecture
at the Temple Etnanu-El last evening.
He was talking to his subject, "A Man
and His Mother."
The â whole lecture was a passionate ap
peal in behalf of the sacredness of the
home of which the mother is the anchor
and guiding star, and a protest against the
"new woman," as that terra contemplates
a departure from it.
â¢'The mother must remain," he said,
"unless nature herself is a lie. I must not
become emotional," lie said. "1 would
rather appeal to your mind than your
heart. But this thought must appeal to
us alike. Maternity is the holiest function
that God has created. The mother stands
as the cornerstone of the home; the home
is the rock upon which the cabin of the
state is builded, and the states so irmly
built constitute or govern the world.
Therefore the mother is the cornerstone
of the world. Her responsibility is the
greatest of all. Can she hope for higher
places, greater reverence or esteem in any
other station?
"It is hers to mold the destiny of her
husband and give direction to the thought
and sentiment of her sons. Her sons are
the coming rulers of the world. Woe be
tide any woman or class of women that
change the relation of maternity.
"How true it is what Washington Irving
has said, 'A father may leave his children
any time, but a mother never.'
"We see the woman of fashion in all her
pride, we see the women stiiving with ad
versity. But it is all the same when the
word mother is used. I cannot imagine a
wicked mother as one disloyal to her own.
Mothers may make mistakes, but they are
true.
"is there a man whose capacity is so
great for sacrifice â who can suffer so
much?
"But where is the man who will turn
from his mo'-her? We see the man Na
poleon dictator to a continent, whose pup
pets were kings, who set up and destroyed
governments, who transgressed ail laws,
wn'o set nations at defiance, who revered
nothing ami cared for no man, who di
vorced the woman he loved for ambition's
sake, the woman who loved him and
mourned him in death. This man never
enrered the presence of his mother without
uncovering ttis head and paying homage
to her who had givpn him birth.
"I tell you the maternal relation shall
not change, it must not Change.
"I am talking for but one object. I do
not want the homes ol our City under
mined."
AN ABANDONED CLAIM.
The Owners Were Sorry and Wanted
Possession Again.
The Supreme Court rendered a decision
in the case ol Trevaskis against Thomas
Pease et al.
The defendants scorned a claim which
lay in two sections of land. It was sold out
by the Sheriff, but the deed of sale was
niade out so as to describe the claim as Jy
ing iÂ» only one section, invalidating the
transfers. It came into the possession of
Henrietta Trevaskis, and she started to de
velop it..
The defendants had practically aban
doned the claim, but when an attorney
called their attention to their defective
sale, they kept their eyes on the property.
The idea was that if in developing the
claim the plaintiff struck "pay-dirt," then
they would step in and get it back, but if
the claim still continued worthless they
woald say nothing. The claim did de
velop into'a paying Droperty, and the de
fendants came in and took possession, un
der the theory that it had never been
leirally sold.
The lower court confirmed this posses

A NEW CAR FENDER.
It Was Called to the Attention of the
Board of Supervisors Yes
terday.
A new car-fender, which is claimed by
its owners to have been successful in East
ern cities where it has been used, was
called to the attention of the Health and
Police Committee of the Board of Super
visors by Supervisor Dimon^d yesterday.
He said that the circulars of the company
claimed tliat the fender had been used in
Providence, R. 1., for sixteen months, and
in other cities for a shorter time, ami had
proved highly successful. The company
kept a record of all accidents on roads
equipped with these guards, and the circu
lars contained a list of the accidents. They
are several hundred in nu.nber, and none
were attended with serious injuries. In
many instances people were picked up by
tee fenders and fubseo.uer.tly \vnlked off
uninjured. It was decided to call the at
tention of Superintendent Vining to the
fender and ask that it be tested.

TRIES TO HIDE
BEHIND NAGLE
Brown Would Shift Respon
sibility for the False
Press Dispatch.
POND'S STRONG WORDS.
The Pastor Severely Criticized
for His "Audacious and Un-.
warranted" Act.
PROMPTLY CALLED TO ACCOUNT
Opponents of the Guilty Man Meet in
Secret Sessionâ Deacons Securing
Evidence.
Dr. Pond â Assuming the report of the
United Press dispatch to be correct, as I
suppose we must, Dr. Brown's course
leems to we unaccountable and most
reprehensible.
The representation in that dispatch of
the meaning and effect of the result of
council is most misleading: and appar
ently cannot be characterized otherwise
than as a falsehood.
I have labored with mygelf to fiud
Mum* way of explaining it, without go
fearful a conception, but find no way to
do so.
If Dr. Brown supposes he can defy the
council his wisdom is even less to be
praised than his spirit. The decision
has, it is true, only the force of the rea
son it gives and which the churches rep
resented in it supply. But this implies
an amount of moral force which no man
ever yet successfully resisted. I earn
estly desire to learn that he has been
misunderstood.
William Ross, San Joseâ l think the
council was very lenient in its verdict,
and I feel that Dr. Brown should have
received a severe censure for his uniniu
isterial acts.
O. B. Parkinson, Stocktonâ But the
findings make it very plain that it was
the sense of the council that had we had
certain other evidence adduced at the
trial, which we heard of from outside
sources, the finding on this point might
have been more explicit.
James Km Barker, Berkeleyâ How are
we to regard the findings given to the
council by Dr. Brown in the Rochester
and other cases wherein he claimed he
was entirely exonerated?
Rev. Dr. Henry K. Hoyt, Sacramentoâ
T hÂ«' re must be some terrible mistake
somewhere.
Rev. Dr. George Mooar, Oaklandâ l
only feel as any other person would feel
to have a man tell a barefaced false
hood.
Rev. W. W. Scudder, Alamedaâ He
ought to go away somewhereâ get out
of the City.
Dr. Brown's trick on the United Press,
by which a dispatch was sent to the East
announcing that the council had acquitted
him unanimously on every charge, seems
to have placed the plausible preacher in
even a more difficult position than ever.
There is only one opinion entertained by
the members of the council and by every
one else as to the moral turpitude of such
an act, and it was reported last night that
it had been determined by leading members
of the First Congregational Church to call
Dr. Brown to account for deliberate false
hood and deceit, and to request his resig
nation should the statement of facts be
ascertained to be true.
With this object in view two deacons of
the church last evening called uoon Nisnt
Editor Frazer of the United Press for a
full statement of what occurred on the
occasion of Dr. Brown's visit to the night
editor with Lawyer Nagle, Mr. Kimball
and Valentine Brown.
It is understood that this statement will
be made the basis of a charge of unminis
terial and ungentlemanly conduct on the
part of Pastor Brown.
The attempt of Dr. Brown to shift the
responsibility of this telegram to the
shoulders of Attorney Nagie will not be as
successful as some other of the reverend
gentleman's moves, it is thought. Nagle
simply played second riddle on that occa
sion, as he has ever since the scandal came
to light.
The most remarkable incident connected
with yesterday's developments came in
the change of heart experienced by Dr.
Pond. Whatever may liave goite before,
that gentleman now thinks with his
brother judges that Brown is a man utterly
devoid of principle.
Attorney Woodhams, who acted as judge
advocate of the council, seems also to
have suffered a complete revulsion of feel-
ings. . .â¢ .
He was closeted for over an hour yester
day with Deacon Barnard, discussing ways
and means to dethrone Pastor Brown, and
the result of the conference is not known.
The preparations for Brown's reception
continues with unabated zeal. His lady
friends will gather In force to-day in the
First Church to complete the floral offer-
ings.
It is rumored th^t Trustee Dodge has
severed his connections with the church,
and will to-morrow be confirmed at St.
Paul's.
TO DEPOSE BROWN.
Meeting of the Pastor's Opponents
in Dr. McDonald's Office Last
Evening.
The most fearless of the anti-Browns to
the number of thirty met in secret confer
ence last night in Dr. Jonathan T. Mc-
Donald's rooms in the Columbia building
and discussed means to oust as soon as
possible the now notorious pastor of the
fe irst Congregational Church in order for
one reason to save two score or more of
the members of the congregation said to
be on the point of severing all connection
with church work because of the unsavory
opinion they have formed from the pres
ent scandal.
It ir the intention not only to depose the
present pastor, but to prevent him from
continuing in the ministry, or. as one
speaker expressed It, "We don't believe in
sending a pestiferous ship to a healthy
port."
All that would be officially given ont for
publication was that there had been "a
unanimous, ardent, enthusiastic meeting
for preliminary work to get the consensus
of opinion of that part of the congregation
interested in the welfare of the church."
Those present declared most positively
that upon the secrecy of their plans de
pends the success of the scheme.
Every person at the meeting had his or
her say, and it was all vigorous denuncia
tion of one man, with suggestions how to
offset his well-known cunning and surprise
him with a stragetic and decisive move.
"We have very serious work ahead of
us for the next month or six weeks," re
marked one of the insurgent army. "The
young people have consented to stay for
a time, until we can see what we can do.
flt"None of us will attend any of the ser
vices, but all of us mean to keep our letters
in the church and continue to be members.
"Every single meeting of any import
ance on Brown's side sends out postal
cards to attend the meeting. They are
not signed, either, but they are written
in that well-known hand. Not one of the
persons at this meeting ever received one
of those cards. They are sent to others;
that is why his side is well represented.
"For last Wednesday night's meeting
Dr. Brown sent out unsigned postal cards
to friends of his, and I know of four re
ceived by persons whom he thought were
his friends."
Mrs. Cooper was present at last night's
council of war, as -was Deacon Barnard
also; and two trustees of the church sent
word expressing their indorsement of the
purpose of the assemblage.
It was remarked that Dr. Brown's self
arranged dispatch for the United Press
had been a boomerang that had injured his
case materially and increased the opposi
tion to him.
In church circles the friends of the pas
tor are sometimes called "Brownies," and
those opposed to him are called "Anti-
Brownies."
THE VALENTINE LETTER.
A Mythical Reporter Claims to
Have Written It Under
Orders.
The Bulletin of yesterday published al
most in its entirety a letter received by the
council just a week before adjournment.
It reads as follows:
Brown Council, First Congregational Church :
It has come to a point where I shall give you a
few pointers relative to the scandal which you
would not otherwise obtain, and at the same
time show up the work of some of the inside
manipulators. I am an ex-newspaper man,
and I have been doing some of the crooked
work in this case for the Bulletin and Chronicle
for pay, which I did not
In the first place I will explain the Valentine
letter, which I wrote at the direction of Free
Older, managing editor of the Bulletin. Asa
sample of writing to imitate I was given two
brief notes from Brown to Mrs. Cooper, both
dated some time in 189-4. The only reason
why Valentine's name was used was to utilize
that single meeting with Brown, which it
was supposed no one else would know
about. As to the knowledge that Brown
had never met Valentine but the once
that is easily explained. About the latter part
of last October I was looking for a position,
and I heard of some possible changes in the
auditing department of Wells. Fargo & Co.
Among half a dozen men approached with
view of getting letter of introduction to
Valentine was this man Brown, who was asked
by a relative of mine. Brown replied that he
did not known Valentine and had only met
him but once in his life, and then only in a
sort of informal way. He did not say when or
where he had met him. In talking this matter
over with Older he told me the occasion must
have been at Ira P. Rankln's funeral, as ihe
Bulletin reporter who reported that funeral
saw Brown and Valentine get into 'the same
carriage. This letter was to serve two pur
poses, to give the Bulletin a sensational scoop
and to aid in working the damnation of
Brown. The letter did not prove very satisfac
tory as far as chirography was concerned,
for the three different experts to whom Older
submitted it for comparison with Brown's
writing said it was entirely different. Finally
one of the Bank of California clerks said it
resembled it. Older never mentioned the
opinion of the three experts, but exploited the
bank clerk's idea for ail it was worth. The ex
perience with this letter scared off the use of
three others. I had my wife write three let
ters signed with Mrs. Baddin's name. Two of
these were dated Livermore and addressed to
Mrs. Davidson. One said the writer was going
to work in Lilienthal's hop ranch, with some
other little news and gossip. The other was
more recent in date and importuned Mrs.
Davidson for some money which Mrs. Baddin
was anxious to get. The third one was of a
compromising nature and was to be sent to Dr.
Brown. He was then to be interviewed and
asked if he had got any letter from Mrs. Bad
din. These Baddin letters were to be first used
in the Chronicle and the Bulletin was to re
liash them that evening.
Both Older and Simpson, the former of the
Bulletin and the latter of the Chronicle, havu
been working off their personal spite against
Brown, assisted by Mrs. Cooper and her friend
Bickford, the pay for these services coming
from Mrs. Stockton's friend Tevis. This man
Bickford stole the Overman letters from Mrs.
Tunnell's bureau drawer. He said that when
he showed them to Older, Simpson and Hatch,
and it was decided that if they could not be
sold for a good sum they had better be pub
lished in the Exaaiiner. so as to make it ap
pear that the Bulletin and the Chronicle were
not doing all the hounding. There were two
letters withheld because tney did not have
anything in about Dr. Brown, although they
were of the same dates as two others which
did refer to Brown, while the latter contained
all the news and gossip that was 'in the former
two.
One of the chief propagators of the scandal
is Mrs. Cooper. She has been the chief source
of information for both Older and Simpson.
It is not known outside the Bulletin office, but
she furnished that paper with the story about
the Rochester scandal. Older said she did not
want to be known as doing this. For that rea
son she has been kept In the background, with
the exception of publishing daily interviews
with her, and almost daily pictures.
Many newspaper men in this City knew Mrs.
Stockton and her associates and haunts, and
no one knows them bettef than Mrs. Cooper,
for they date back to the time when Mrs.
Stockton was one of Mrs. Cooper's teachers.
Mrs. Cooper is now standing on the solid coin
side of this case, as she always does on all
others. Tevis is putting up ttfe coin. I know
this, because I have had some of it myself.
How much Older and SimpÂ«o:i are getting f
don't know, but I have got very little, and that
is what lam kicking abouj. Simpson has been
boasting for weeks past of what he has been
'doing to Brown, in Norman's saloon on Bush
street and other places. He says he will make
Brown either commit suicide or sneak out oi
town. Simpson's dislike for Brown dates back
to the time when some deacon of the church
was in trouble.
These are samples of the leg-pullers and
thugs who are working the Brown scandal for
coin on the outside. They have done me up
and now Ido them. Older and Simpson were
to pay me for writing the letters. I got $5
from Older, but Simpson, nit. He says he
would try to work it in on space bills only for
John P. Young, who goes over all Dills with a
microscope.
This jod don't need any proof outside the
two papers, the Bulletin and the Chronicle.
They quote from each other and any one can
compare their cooked-up accounts with all the
other papers in the City. The malice of con
spiracy backed by coin shines out in every
paragraph.
Let the council summon Older, Mrs. Cooper,
Simpson, Bicktord, Hatch and Donley and
question them on lines above set forth.
HENRY MAYER.
Commenting on the above, Mr.'- Older,
city editor of the Bulletin, said:;.-
-"On the day preceding the conclusion of
the taking of testimony by the council,
when Dr. Brown felt: that he had failed to
inject into the I minds of the councilmen a
doubt as to his guilt, he decided to make
a last attempt to swerve them ; from the'
coa^luaiou whiah - seemed ' inevitable. I*
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1896.
was the most propitious moment to move,
because there -would be little time for in
vestigation, and the council would act
upon the latest impression it had received.
Proceeding on this impulse, with a blind
ness as to consequences which has been
characteristic of him throughout the trial,
Dr. Brown sent to the council the letter,
written in the same handwriting as the
Valentine letter, and on Call copy paper.
The letter was signed Henry Mayer. Its
object was to blacken the characters of
the persons who, Dr. Brown considered,
had injured him most in the eyes of the
council. A paragraph charging Mrs.
Sarah B. Cooper with a crime which is so
atrocious and preposterous that its publi
cation is avoided in the cause of decency,
is omitted, as also is another paragraph
assailing the character of a young woman
of hitherto unquestioned probity.
"The letter Is written in the same chir
ography as the Valentine letter. The
writer says he wrote|the Valentine letter.
yet with strange inconsistency he says
that he was civen two notes from Dr.
Brown to Mrs. Cooper, from which he
might copy the pastor's writing. He evi
dently did not copy the writing, because
the Valentine letter and the last effusion
are in the same handwriting. He did not
disguise his writing at all.
"The story of the incident of the Ira P.
Rankin funerai is not only false, but it evi
dently came from Dr. Brown, and clearly
indicates him as the author of the letter.
The man who reported the Rankin funeral
for the Bulletin was the telegraph editor,
who was asked to do the work because
there was no one else in the office that day
to attend to it. The telegraph editor has
never in his lite seen Dr. Brown. He did
not enter the church and did not see Mr.
Valentine enter a carriage with Dr. Brown.
Mr. Valentine has stated that he never
told anybody of the meeting with Dr.
Brown on the occasion in question, and be
sides himself Dr. Brown was the on'y per
son who knew of it.
"Who else than Dr. Brown could have
written this last letter? Who is suffi
ciently interested in vilifying Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper, in casting odium upon the
editors of the Bulletin and the Chronicle?
Who besides himself would stoop so low
as to detail a false story of the wrong do
ings of a pure girl as the writer did in this
letter in the portion of it which is with
held from publication ? It is impossible to
answer this except by saying that there is
nobody else who could have written it,
That there is no Henry Mayer has been
shown, and it is impossible to conceive
that any of Dr. Brown's friends would
have undertaken the task. It is directly
in the pastor's line of work, as hitherto
disclosed."
Mr. Simpson Explains.
Mr. Simpson of the Chronicle is greatly
incensed that his name should have in any
way been brought into the disgraceful pro
ceedings. He said yesterday :
"Mayer is an entirely new factor in the
newspaper world of San Francisco so far
as I know or have been able to learn.
There are so many groundless accusations
in the letter as to make it almost un
worthy of notice.
"For instance, I never saw or heard of
the Tunnell-Overman letters until they ap
peared in print, and again I never em
ployed any one. in getting news but regular
reporters. The charge that the Chronicle
has persecuted Dr. Brown is a 9 amusing as
it is untrue. To the contrary, I have sup
pressed many damaging facts concerning
the now properly adjudged guilty man.
"There is one significant circumstance
connected with the letter received by the
council on the afternoon of March 12. On
the afternoon of the same day I received a
letter signed 'Guss.' I never knew but
one person by that name, and he was at
one time employed here asotfice-boy. The
writer said the council had received im
portant information concerning the Val
entine letter.
"I gave the matter little or no consider
ation, because the handwriting was not of
such a character as to inspire particular
confidence."
Mrs. Brown said last night that her hus
band was out on business and that, so far
as she knew, he had not read the Henry
Mayer letter.
DR. HOYT'S VIEW.
He Thinks There Must Have Been
Some Horrible Mistake In
the Matter.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 20.â Dr.
Henry N. Hoyt, pastor of the First Con
gregational Church of this city, in speak
ing of the tendings of the Brown case,
said:
"There seems to be a prevalent idea that
there was a great divergence of opinion
among the members of the council, but
this was not the fact. On the contrary
there was great unanimity and but a few
slight differences. I have been intimately
acquainted with Dr. Brown for twenty
seven years. T/e were schoolmates, and I
knew his characteristics well. He is a
tighter, and could never see the necessity
of fighting quietly, nor could he ever
comprehend that a soft answer is often
more effective than a harsh one.
"There can be no doubt that he
had to endure an excessive strain, and we
were fully conversant with that fact, and
during the first two weeks we made every
allowance for him. but at last I went to
him and personally warned him that his
conduct was hurting his own cause. After
that he changed his tactics and everything
was harmonious. Dr. Brown criticizes the
action of the council on two points. One
of those â the young lady accusing him of
intimidation â he claims came up after the
council had been in session, and he says
we had no right to inquire into this. Per
haps we did not, but why did he not so
state at that time, instead of waiting until
this late day ? The other point was in regard
to the payment of the $500 to Mrs. David
son.
"In the findings of the council we say
j we did not consider his reason for paying
the money to purchase the silence of the
supposed Mrs. Baddin was for the purpose
of obtaining a legal hold on those who were
I attempting to blackmail him. The steno
' graphic reports will show that Dr. Brown
said that for forty-eight hours after Mrs.
j Davidson attempted to blackmail him he
{ did not know whether the earth waa un
i der his feet or over his head, and that he
I gave the money because he was over
whelmed with terror. This he has reiter
ated to us over and over. .1 do not care to
express any opinion as regards the tele
graphic report which, it is alleged, Mr.
Brown cave to the press, until I hear his
own explanation. There must be some
terrible mistake somewhere. Of course, I
consider prevarication extremely repre
hensible in any individual, and far more
so in a minister of the Gospel. But there
surely must be a mistake."
BAREFACED FALSEHOOD.
Rev. Dr. Mooar Says the Distorted
Dispatch Was Very Wrong
and Unwise.
OAKLAND, Cal.,; March â¢'â 'â :â  20.â Rev.'
George Mooar, D.D., of the Pacific Theo
logical Seminary and one ,of ' the [â  members

charges against Rev. C. O. Brown, 1 was

council. He said :
"1 only feel as any other person would

patch he did a very wrong and a very un
wise thing for himself. I should think
that he would have seen that to do such
a thing when the full text of the findings
were going to be made public would only
ha\ne injured his cause.
"I have been told by others that he now
denies that he sent or dictated the dispatch
to the United Press as related in The Call.
How true this is I cannot tell. All I know
of the wnole affair is what I have read in

they actually were.

"WAS VERY WRONG."
Deacon William Ross Says Dr.
Brown's Press Dispatch Was
Not Right.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 20.â William
Ross, a deacon in the First Congrega
tional Church in this city and a member
of the Brown council, when interviewed
to-day in regard to Dr. Brown's attitude
toward the council, said:
"I think tiiat tne council was very leni
ent in its verdict, and I feel that Dr.
Brown should have received a severe cen
sure for his unministerial acts. The ver
dict was entirely satisfactory to me with
the exception of that part of the findings
which reads, 'We are regretfully com
pelled to confess that Dr. Brown's ex
planation of the reasons in his mind for
paying to Mrs. Davidson the sura of $500
and agreeing to pay the further sum of $35
per month for a series of years, all for the
purpose of securing the silence of a sup
posed Mrs. Baddin, is not altogether satis
factory to us.'
"I thought the word 'altogether' ought
to .have been eliminated. While I believe
it was a scheme of Mrs. Tunnell's to black
mail Dr. Brown, I believe he was a little
injudicious and unwise in his acts. In the
council the testimony of Deacons Barnard
and Hatch and Mrs. Thurston and Mrs.
French carried great weight, and but little
attention was paid to the testimony of
Mrs. Davidson, Mrs. Stockton and Miss
Overman.
"If Dr. Brown sent out that press report
he is said to have done, I think it was very
wrong and entirely out of place. I can see
no reason wh3 r Dr. Brown should criticize
the action of the council, for they dealt
very leniently with him."
UNFITTED TO PREACH.
James L. Baricer Says Dr. Brown
Is Unworthy to Occupy the
Pulpit.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 20.â James L.
Barker, the member of the Brown council
from Berkeley, was interviewed to-night
with reference to the statement which Dr.
C. O. Brown has made through the press
with relation to the decision of the council
in his case.
Mr. Barker furnished The Call corre
spondent the following statement, to which
he appended his signature:
"Dr. Brown is wholly to blame for the
unfortunate position in which he finds
himself. It is most painful to think that a
minister of the gospel, wnose word should
be absolute, should so falsify the findings
of the council in his statement forwarded
to the Associated Press with the view of
misrepresenting the verdict.
"How are we to regard the findings
given to the council by Dr. Brown in the
Rochester and other cases, wherein lie
claimed he was entirely exonerated? My
feeling in the matter is that he was treated
very mildly. I am convinced by what I
have seen and heard during the meetings
of the council and since that the conduct
of C. 0. Brown has been of such serious
nature as to render him unfitted and un
worthy to occupy the Christian pulpit; his
overbearing and dictatorial manner, his
imperious behavior toward many of his
flock is of such a nature as to demand a
severe censure. He has clearly, to my
mind, shown his unfitness to correctly rep
resent as a minister of the gospel the living
example and teachings of the Divine Mas
ter. J. L. Barker."
AGREES WITH DR. SINK.
O. B. Parkinson of Stockton Gives
Brown Another
Rap.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 20.â Attorney
O. B. Parkinson, who as deacon in the
First Congregational Church in this city,
was a member of the council that tried
Dr. Brown, said this evening in discussing
the doctor's attack upon the council and
their findings:
"I heartily concur with Dr. Sink in his
opinion that Dr. Brown's remarks were
discourteous ans uncalled for. Dr. Brown
is himself to blame for the fact that the
young lady whose examination brought
about the insertion of the plank in the
findings condemning him for intimidation
was placed 6n the stand. He offered no
objections at the time to her bern? called,
and, in fact, went so far as to question her
himself.
â¢'As an attorney Ido not see how the
council could have found him guilty of the
more serious charge. The evidence was
such that no jury could have convicted
him on trial in a court. But the findings
made it very plain that it was the sense of
the council that had we had certain other
evidence adduced at the trial, which vre had
heard of from outside sources, the finding
on this point might have been more ex
plicit. Dr. Brown has no reason to com
plain of the action of the council, and as
he was one of the principal ones who de
manded the hearing, he should not be dis
satisfied because the council could notcon
scientiouslysustain his defense in the case."
HE SHOULD RETIRE.
Rev. Dr. Scudder Thinks Brown
Ought to Go Away Out of
the City.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 20.â Rev. W.
W. Scudder of the First Congregational
Church of Alameda, who was one of the
council which tried Dr. Brown, was asked
yesterday what he thought of Dr. Brown's
attitude to the council. He was rather re
luctant to commit himself, but said :
"Anything I could say in regard to Dr.
Brown's attitude toward the council would
not help matters in the least, but neverthe
less something could be said and said
straight, too. What Dr. Brown has said
denouncing the council is something I
think almost every member of it rather
expected. The reverend gentleman, of
course, is much more nettled over the mild
censure given by the council than he
would have been had he received scathing
write-ups from the newspapers, because he
knows that his acts have been investigated
and passed upon by a body which would
be expected to exhibit a good deal of
leniency.
"If I were in Dr. Brown's place I would
be content to remain silent, retire and try
to live the trouble down. I should realize
how easily I had been dealt with and
would not think of criticizing a mild
verdict. But Dr. Brown is an impulsive
man. The sting of the council's rebuke he
still feels, and perhaps thinks that by de
nouncing it he will gain sympathy."
Asked if he thought Dr. Brown would
remain with bis church, Rev. Mr. Scudder
said: "Well, I shouldn't think he would
want to. He ought to go away some
where, get out of the City and go to some
place where he could avoid further trouble.
I know I would want to do so."
WILL HIRE A HALL.
Mrs. Davlnson Intends to Thunder
Forth the Gosnel From Met
ropolitan Hall.
Mrs. Davidson thinks the most charita
ble view of the council's verdict in the
Brown case is that the men composing it
are not persons of clear mental and moral
vision.
"Why did they not accept the Overman-
Tunnell letters as evidence?" she said.
"True, Miss Overman claimed they were
changed to fit the occasion, but they knew
her -word could not be depended upon.
I counted fifty-six lies in her statement to
the council. Yet there have been instances
when a child's testimony, unsupported by
any other, has been so convincing to Judte
and jury that a verdict was found on its
strength in a murder case. How much
more convincing were those letters, bear
ing the stamp of genuineness.
"Brown's character is before the public.
He has shown his nature by his action in
trying to send out dispatches to the world
announcing that the council had found
him innocent of every charge. But he
doesn't do those things skillfully. He is
a blacksmith, so uses a bludgeon."
Mrs. Davidson speaks freely of what she
intends to do after her acquittal. "I will
hire Metropolitan Hall," sne said, "and
thunder forth the gospel."
The trial of Mrs. Davidson will open be
fore Judge Bahrs on Monday morning.
Dr. Brown has engaged Carroll Cook to
aÂ«sist in prosecuting the case, and he, with
Davis Louderback and some one from the
District Attorney's office, will form "coun
sel for the prosecution." George Knight
will defend the accused.
Mr. Knight insists that Mattie Overman
and Mrs. Tunnell be present, and he has
demanded that subpenas be sent after
them.

was given yesterday for Miss Overman's)
sudden flight southward.
It is that a face reminding her of certain
conditions and deeds of a past she would '
like to forget appeared at the council;
that the apparition frightened her and
she fled before it.
A fair attorney of Tacoma is in trie City
on legal business and attended the session !
of the ecclesiastical court the last day
Miss Overman was seen there. She re
membered the heroine of the Brown scan
dal. Indeed she had had professional j
knowledge of her. and it was with a keen ;
sense of interest that she looked upon the ;
young woman once more. When Matties :
wandering glance took in the features of i
her one time legal enemy she paled per- j
ceptibly. The next day she was missing,
and now the bright lady attorney laughs j
and says, "I scared her out of town."
The attorney's story is that her practice
made her cognizant of and in fact partici
pant in a case in which the principal fig
ures were male associates of Mattie Over
man and her sister. An Adolf Wolf was
robbed and the suspects were traced to the
place where Mattie and her sister were j
staying. The young women gained some j
unenviable notoriety, in that connection,
being shadowed by the police for several
weeks because of that association. As a j
result they left the Queen's Hotel, where j
they were staying, and soon after left the
city.
The recollection of the episode, with its
incidents of visits from the blue-coated
guardians of the peace, was not a pleasant
one, and fears of a more forcible reminder
of it, the lady believes, led to Miss Over
man's flight.

STATE JOURNALISTS MEET
They Adopt an Important Reso
lution in Regard to Second-
Class Mails.
Will Hold Their Big Meeting in May
at Sacramento, When Nevada
Editors Can Be Present.
The executive committee of the Califor
nia Press Association met last night at the
rooms of the San Francisco Press Club
and transacted some important business.
C. F. Montgomery of the Antioch
Ledper, the president, occupied the chair.
W. D. Pennycook of the Vallejo Cnronicle,
who is acting secretary of the association,
acted as secretary. The following other
members of the committee were present:
Allen B. Lemmon of the Santa Rosa Re
publican, J. M. Francis of the Napa
Register, E. B. Willis of the Sacramento
Record-Union, Raleigh Barcar of the Vaca
ville Reporter, J. A. Filcher of the Placer
ville Argus and T. CJ. Daniells of the Ala
meila Argus.
The object primarily of the meeting was
the consideration of the Loud bill affect
ing the admission of second-class matter
to the mails. The suojoined resolution
was unanimously passed:
Whereas, There is pending in Congress a
bill, entitled "a bill to amend the postal laws
relating to second-class mail matter," H. R.

forms suggested in and by the bill regarding
that class of matter which has, under the guise
oi newspaper publications and magazine liter
ature, congested the mails of the country and
prostituted the service to the carriage and dis
tribution of trashy and often dangerous litera
ture, and of matter intended merely for adver
tising purposes.
The time of holding the spring meeting
of the association was also discussed. A
committee was finally appointed to ar
range for the meeting at Sacramento at
such a time in May as will correspond
with the arrival of the members of the
Nevada Press Association on their trip to
California. It is the intention to mcci the
visitors at that time and extend to them
courtesies befitting the occasion.
The California editors of the executive
committee are taking great interest in all
that concerns the association.
An Important Discovery.
A large and partially unexplored region
north of the province of Quebec and be
tween the head waters of the Ottawa
River and James Bay, the southern por
tion of Hudson Bay, has recently been the
scene of a notable discovery by Professor
Bell of the Canada Geological Survey.
During his explorations last summer he
traced the course of a lame river, hitherto
unknown, which drains the region to the
southeast of James Bay. The river is
larger than the Ottowa, and a great part of
it averages a mile in width. The country
drained by it is level or gently undulating,
and may be generally described as a
plateau of 1000 feet above the sea level
along the height of land, diminishing to
some 400 feet at 100 miles or so from the
mouth of the river, and then descending
more rapidly to the shore of James Bay.
The soil is sandy in the vicinity of the
height of land and for some distance be
yond, but of brownish clay along the
banks of rivers and in the forests. The
country is well wooded, and is fitted to be
the home of a large population.

JUDGE PATERSON WILL CONTEST
Judge Slack Grants All Parties a
Week in Which to Frepare
for the Fray.
When Judge Slack called the Fair case
yesterday morning Mr. Delnias stated
that Dr. Marc Leving<ton was ready to
proceed with the trial of the contest which
had been filed_ by ex-Judge Paterson on
behalf of Herman Oeirichs Jr.
Mr. Paterson said there was a de
murrer to his contest which had not been
disposed of.
"We have nothing to do with any de
murrer," said Mr. Delmas. "The gentle
man refers to the demurrer of Mr.
Wheeler, with which we are not con
cerned."
"What becomes of your issue if that de
murrer is sustained ?" asked the Judge.
"We have interposed no demurrer," said
Delmas. "Two separate ami distinct par
ties have filed two distinct and independ
ent petitions for the probate of will. To
each of these a contest is Bled. To those
contests one party files an answer so as
to have the matter speedil}- determined
and the other for purposes cf delay
interposes a demurrer. Is the one who
answers to be tied up because the other
chooses to pursue dilatory tactics? Shall
Dr. Leviagston be delayed in the enforce
ment of his rignts because those who ap
parently desired the probating of the same
document now for reasons best known
to themselves no longer wish to join in
that request? We care nothing for their
demurrer. We have nothing to do with it."
"Your Honor will not try this matter
piecemeal, 1 suppose?" remarked Mr. Pat
erson, addressing the court. "I wish to
amend the contest."
"You may amend your contest as you
may see fit," responded Mr. Delmas,
suavely, "and we will agree to the amend
ment now."
"But you must give a man a little time,"
] 'leaded Paterson, in a rather aggrieved
tone. "I want to know just how and
where I stand, and shall require a day or
two in order to look the matter up."
"Very well," answered Delmas; "which
contest do you wish to amend?"
Mr. Paterson said he desired only to
amend the contest to the petition of the
Fair children, and Judge Slack continued
all of the matters then under considera
tion until next Friday morning, granting
leave to Judgo Paterson to amend his
contest to the petition of Charles L. Fair
ami his sisters.
"We are ready to go on with the trial,"
said Mr. Delmas. in answer to the Judge's
ruling: "but we want the machinery of a
trial to be in readiness. In other words,
we want a jury on the spot."
"I have already issued an order for a
jury," rejoined Judge Slack, "and it
will undoubtedly be here in court next
Friday."
This ended the day's proceedings, by far
the most surprising day since the famous
case began. The contemplated settlement
of a troublesome difficulty by an amicable
arrangement between the opposing parties
was knocked on the head at the supreme
moment; and just when the late Senator's
millions seemed barely within the grasp
of his heirs-at-law, the successful interven
tion of the proponent of the pencil will
threw the whole litigation back into the
courts.
When the special administrators, who
are proponents of the first will, and the
three children, who offer the second for
probate, came together and determined
that as the courts would in all probabil
ity knock out the trust clause contained
in the first will, both as to real and per
sonal property, and consequently there
was no need in further opposing the pro
bate of the first will, pending a decision
on the trust question, at least, the heirs
at-law, while still retaining their position
as proponents of the second will, with
drew all opposition to the first, merely re
serving the right to again contest within
the next twelve months should they feel
disposed to do so â i. c., should the Su
preme Court decide adversely to their in
terests respecting the trust clause.
The way was then paved for the admis
sion to probate oi the first will, and ad
mitted it would have been but for the in
sistence of the pencil will. The parties in
' concocting their amicable scheme had
reckoned without Dr. Marc LevingstOn,
â who is named as an executor in the
in the pencil will of September 24.
Dr. Levingston has no place, no mention
in the first will, and so it was natural
that he should raise his gentle voice in
protest against such arbitrary measures
as were beinjr put through. Not only are
there commisyionÃ to be earned by an
executor of a will disposing of so vast an
estate, but there are fees to be earned by
his attorneys. And Dr. Levingston is
muchly represented in this respect, Del
mas & Shortridge, J. D. Sullivan and
Lansing Mizner posing as his legal
battering-rams.
Hence the sudden stoppage of the pro
ceedings in probate, and the appearance
of Mr. Delmas in court yesterday to
object to their resumption. It was a fight
of one against a host, so to speak, and the
one triumphed. After hearing arguments
for an hour or so Judge Slack
ordered the proceedings for probate of the
first will continued until disposition was
made of the second. Mr. Delmas could ill
conceal his gratification, and it was with
genuine unction that he referred to the
"perfect harmony that now seems to exist
among those wiio were so bitterly opposed
to one another"; and he informed the
court that he would now proceed to prove
the second will, "without, however, the
assistance of those wi;o had first pro
pounded it."
So for the time being at least Dr. Leving
ston and his attorneys are on top. Ex-
Justice Van R. Paterson, representing
Herman Oelrichs Jr., has filed an opposi
tion to Leviugston's petition for probate of
this second will, and answer having been
filed, issue is joined and the case will
go to trial before a jury. There is also
another petition for probate of this will,
which Judge Paterson has also opposed,
but issue is not yet joined herein. Till
both th/se petitions are disposed of the
proponents of the first will must hold
their peace.
Furthermore the late Senator's children
are placed in a very awkward position just
now. For by the arrangement with the
special administrators before alluded to
they now pose as contestants of the
very will they themselves put for
ward. And the question remains
whether charges of forgery and fraud
having been made by the proponents of
the first will in respect to the second, will
the heirs-at-law take sides with them
when the trial of Judge Paterson's contest
comes up and assist in attempting to prove
the will which they themselves offered for
probate a forgery ? In any case, the liti
gation is just now in a very interesting
tangle.
The Juror's Opinion,
Congressman Charles Daniels of Buffalo,
formerly a Justice of the New York Su
preme Court, told a story the other day
which shows on what strange evidence peo
ple sometimes adopt conclusions. A. man
had been convicted of the murder of his
wife, and the case was finally carried to
the Court of Appeals, which reversed
the finding of the lower court. A spe
cial hearing was ordered by the Governor.
This was held at Syracuse, and Justice
Daniels was called upon to preside. In
examining the jurors, one man said that
he was prejudiced in the matter. When
asked if ho had gleaned his prejudice from
the papers or by talking with interested
parties, or by hearsay, he replied to every
question that he didn't know a thing about
the case, but that he was, nevertheless,
prejudiced. He was excused, but Justice
Daniels was not satisfied, and he sent the
Sheriff and had the juror brought back tc
him. He asked him where he nad gained
his prejudice. The fellow replied: "I
don't know anything about the case, bui
the lawyers made such idiots of them
selves in examining the jurors that I knew
the man must be guilty." â New York

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1896.
TO WED A KENTUCKIAN.
Engagement Announced of Miss
Claire Ralston and Dr.
Bullitt.
THE BRIDE AN OAKLAND BELLE
The Youne Physician Is a Member of
an Old and Prominent South
ern Family.
The engagement has just been announced
of Miss Claire Ralston, the popular young
Oakland belle, to Dr. James Bell Bullitt, a
prominent young physician of Louisville,
Kentucky.
Miss Ralston is the only daughter of A.
J. Ralston, president of the Selby Smelt
ing and Lead Company of this City. Dur
ing the past few years Miss Ralston has
been one of the bright and shining lights
in the social firmament of her native city
as well as on this side of the bay.
Talented, accomplished, affable, merry
Miss Claire Ralston.
[Drawi) from a photograph.]
and obliging it is not astonishing that the
young lady counts her friends by the score.
Nor is Miss Ralston's popularity con
â¢ fined to this coast alone. In her numer
: ous Eastern visits she has met many charm-
I ing people who, captured by the delightful
j Californian's brilliant intellect and sunny
temper, have developed into stanch friends.
In September last Miss Ralston, in com
; pany with her mother, left for an ex
, tended visit to Mrs. Ralston's aunt and
i UDcle, Mr. and Mrs. Daniel R. Williams,
! and their family at Stockbridge, Mass.
It was while spending a few weeks with
I her friend Mrs. Wilder, at her home in
| Louisville, Ky., that the young Oakland
j belle met her fate. It was a case of lpve
at first sight. The young couple met, the
doctor saw and Miss Ralston conquered.
Dr. Bullitt is a member of one of the
| oldest and most prominent of the aris
j tocratic Southern families. On both sides
I he is connected with noted Southern fam-
i lies. He is the youngest son of Hon.
! Joshua F. Bullitt, one of the be9t known
, and most popular men in Kentucky, who
has had a long and active career as a
lawyer and jurist.
No date for the wedding of the young
couple has yet been set, but it will proba
\ bly oe celebrated in the near future at the
> home of the bride's parents, 1170 Madison
i street, Oakland.
Mrs. Ralston and Miss Ralston are still
! visiting their relatives in Massachusetts,
' and the date of their return is indefinite.
CONNECTICUT TOWN OLEEK.
Othnlel Gager Was Delicate as a Boy, but
Lived in OfÃre to the Age of 96.
There i 9 something about the office of
â  Town Clerk in the Nutmeg State, perhaps
; i n the tranquil atmosphere ef the place it
j self, more likely in the humdrum, unemo
i tional nature of the work transacted there,
| that is conducive not only to long terms
of office on the part of the clerk, but also
to longevity. Although the office is a
yearly electoral one, nevertheless a Town
Clerk in Connecticut see-ms to grow into
I it, to become a part and parcel of his of
| ficial den as much as ite inanimate fixtures
\ are, so that only very rarely any one pre
| sumes to take it away from him. Often
both great parties or three or four partres
place his name on their caucus tickets and
vote for him to a man year after year.
Such was the political experience of Oth
niel Gager, Town Clerk of Norwich, one of
the last of the old-time Puritans, wno at
the time of his death not long ago had
the unchallenged record of being the oldest
Town Clerk, in point of continuous ser
i vice in the office, of any one in the United
I States. Mr. Gager had been a slender,
sickly youth, so frail in constitution, in
fact, that his parents often said to the
neighbors about their Bean Hill home
that they really did not think they would
be able to raise Othniel. Nevertheless,
Othniel was raised successfully enough;
! he raised himself, as a matter of fact, and
one day, in the very remote past, his
townsmen came together and elected him
Town Clerk. That settled it.
Mr. Gager was only a middle-aged man
when he went into the office, and he stayed
right there, without a break in his term of
i service, between forty and fifty years, until
I the angel of death came to him .<t his desk
[ one day, and the old man closed the town
| books forever. Yet he never had an hour
of perfect health, perhaps was never free
from pain, in his long life â he was 96 when
he died â and during the last ten years he
| hobbled about on crutches. In the final
! ten years of his clerical career he seemed
to grow closer all tue tirue to his books on
the tall desk under a southern window, his
face almost sweeping his page, so that a
stranger entering the office received the
I momentary impression that the venerable
Town Clerk was a great clerical ant cling
ing to the record page or a monstrous fly
crawling laboriously over it.
At such a time old Mr. Gager was the
picture of official serenity, of unsullied of
ficial rectitude and integrity, of boundless,
i unhurried, old-time patience and perse
j vorance, and of unruffled and unassailable
calm. His handwriting was fine, round,
rather small, and as clear as print, and
there was not a blot or a blur or blemish
of any kind in any one of the many pon
derous books penned by his hand in his
forty-six or forty-seven years of continu
ous service. The books were his books as
well as the town's: he cherished them as a
father cherishes his children.
He was succeeded in the office by Samuel
Freeman, who has had the office continu
ously for seven years, is voted for, as a
rule, almost unanimously by all parties,
and is likely to grow old in the oflice and
grow to the books, as Othniel Gager did.
In a number of other Connecticut towns
Town Clerks iiave had somewhat similar
experiences. For instance.Town Clerk Wil
liam Greene of Waterford, adjoining this
city, who lately lo3t the place to J . E. Beck
witb, had held the office for ten years, and
that is rather a long time to retain an offi
cial berth that is dependent on yearly elec
tions. Then there are the Averys of the
old country town of Groton, across the
Thames River from here, among rugged
hills, who have kept their towns record
continuously twenty or thirty years; and
there was the late Edmund Spicer, who
was Town Clerk of Ledyard, north of Gro
ton, a still ruggeder land, for just twenty
years, when the hand of death took the
pen from his trembling fingers just as it
had done in the case of Othniel Gager.
Many other instances might easily be cited
in which clerks Of Nutmeg State towns
have grown gray putting down in white
and black the official annals of the towns.
It is not likely, however, that the memor
able record of old Mr. Gager wiil ever be
displaced by a greater one.â New York Sun.
DISKAELI ON DARWIN.
The Statesman Declared Himself on
the Side of the Angels.
T. H. S. Escott. author of "Platform,
Press, Politics and Play," waa present in
the Sheldonian Theater when Disraeli de
livered his famous speech against Darwin
ism. Disraeli, says Mr. Escott, had been
visiting friends in the neighborhood, Cas
ually, it would seem, or (as perhaps it was)
with artistically concealed purpose, he
dropped in at a diocesan meeting on his
way to the railway station.
That which chiefly impressed the admir
ing youths was his historically bucolic cos
tume. A soft white billy-cock hat sur
mounted his marble brow, over which
there still clustered the ringlets that had
once been jet black. He wore a short black
tailless velvet coat. Hia uether limbs
were encased in knickerbockers, wiih
gaiters.
At first he spoke in a studiedly common
place strain. Only a few platitudes about
lay and clerical intercommunication, or
the advantages in this respect enjoyed by
Oxford, escaped his lips. More than once
he seemed to have lost the thread of his
discourse. These, probably, were his ar
tifices, or rhetorical feints. Presently,
struck, it seemed, by a sudden inspiration,
he warmed to his theme.
First came his description of the national
church. This was memorable, because,
though it has not, I think, yet been no
ticed, Disraeli's Oxford words prefigured
the policy which ten years later, as Prime
Minister," in 1874. he was to embody in his
public worship bill. The church, he said,
would not be disestablished; but Parlia
ment, disliking an "iniperium in imperio,"
would tighten its hold over it. Then fol
lowed a series of rattling sentences, ver
bally prophetic of the preface written by
him many years later for his collected
novels. The broad church party received
some airy badinage. Dean (then Canon)
Stanley was complimented on hi 9 "pic
turesque sensibility."
Mr. Jowett was indicted as a nebulous
professor who, if he were condemned to
read in perpetuity his own works, might
gather some idea of that endless punish
ment which he and his school were said to
doubt. Next, epigrammatically summariz
ing the discussion, Disraeli remarked:
"The question, after all, is whether man is
an ape or an angel. As for me, my lords
and gentlemen" (here the .speaker puts his
hands into bis velvet sack's side pockets,
and strutting, as one of his liughenden
peacocks might have done, across the plat
form, uttered this startling and historic
sentiment), "1 am on the side of the
angels."
FOREST FIRES.
A Policy Which, If Adopted, Michf
Save the Trees.
It is many years now since the senior
conductor of this magazine pointed out
that nothing could possibly save American
forests from serious conflagrations but
some well-directed effort to get rid of dead
brushwood, which everywhere abounds.
It is pleasant to note that this seed
sown so long ago is now bearing
fruit. Scretary Morton has dis
tinctly stated to one of the forestry convon
ventions that there is absolutely no other
hope of saving a forest from lire than the
removal of the dead brushwood â and this
idea is now being taken up in forest arti
cles in newspapers and in speeches in con
ventions. In the early part of the season
it was stated that the losses by forest
fires in New Jersey would certainly come
up to $200,000. Then it was stated that
if the State of New Jersey were to appro
priate $200,000 for the employment of for
est wardens it would be a ch-ap thing to
do. These forest wardens are to havenoth
ine to do but sit around and wait for the
beginning of the fire, and then put it out.
If a $100,000 or only $."iO,OOO were spent
in removing the dead brushwood, upon
which the lire feeds, the money
would be better spent. But the universal
weakness of our own people is to think
that nothing can be done unless the State
has a finger in the pie"â not only in
forestry, but in many other good efforts.
The true forestry policy should be
to encourage private enterprise. The
State might give a bonus tor the best
cared for forest after a certain number
of years, and it might relieve forest lands
from their share of taxation. In many
ways it could be made the interest of
owners to plant forests and to care for
those which are worth caring for. To our
minds, the talk of the Forest Wardens,
and similar State expenditures, are all
labors at the wrong end. â Median's

HADES.
Hades is not hell. It means the unseen, the
spirit world, where we all must go.â Rev.
James K. Vernon, Christian Church, Augusta,
Georgia.
THE NEGRO QUESTION.
The negro problem will never be solved until
the colored race is placed in a condition that
will enable every colored man to earn his own
living.â Rev. P. A. Hubert, Salisbury, N. C.
WOMEN.
Women are not angels. W3 may think so at
one period of our lives, but we lose the delu
' slon as we grow older.â Rev. Clarke Raboteau,
I Baptist, Jersey City, N. J.
A SUPREME BEING.
False gods, idols, the sun and other objects
j were worshiped by the ancient pagans, but
: the spirit showed that they believed in a being
' higher than in mortal man.â Rev. Father Ma
lone, Catholic, Scranton, Pa.
EVERYDAY HEROES.
Out from the tenements and factories and
shops come as noble examples of heroic self
| sacrifice and service as ever came from palace
or mansion. All human inequalities must give
way under the test of God's righteous measure
ments.âRev. P. A. Baker, Methodist, Colum
bus, Ohio.
CHANCE.
Chance is uncertainty; and any one who
undertakes nny work, any transaction or any
performance without seeing his way clear,
trusting to chance, must not be surprised if he"
meets with failure and disappointment, espe- !
cially when the chance is based upon mere
superstition.â Rabbi L. Weiss, Hebrew, Coluni
bus, Ohio.
PATRIOTISM.
Patriotism is a holy emotion and it has the
Bible for its sanction. The great master and
teacher of us all, Jesus Christ, was a patriot.
He believed in the state and taught us to re
spect and honor the law of the land.â Rev. A.
K. Fuller, Baptist, Newburg, N. Y.
SUICIDE.
Suicide is not known among the savagesâ lt
is a sin and a blot upon civilization. In Ire
land it is almost unheard of, because it is a
Catholic country; because there the suicide is
nbt taken to church with brass bands, rlowers,
banners and a big procession.â Bishop Mc-
Govern, Catholic, Harrisburg, Pa.

human mommwi
Man is ever climbing higher and higher. He
is developing new powers, opening new
avenues of growth and is expanding intellect
ually, morally and spiritually. Man is becom-
I ing divine as the ages roll away.â Rev. U. S.
MilDurn, I'niversalist, Cincinnati. Ohio.
THE END OF THE WORLD.
The earth and the heavens are to be burned
'â¢ up. That is what the Bible says. Science is
â  gradually coming around to believe with the
! bible. Scientists agree now that the old earth
niust be burned up. Unless it is recuperated
! somehow this old world must go to smash.â
j Rev. C. M. Hall, Methodist, Lowell, Mass.
SPIRITUALISM.
The sooner the church recognizes the fact
: that if spiritualism is false its Bible is false the
i better it will be for all concerned. Theatti-
I tudo of tfce evangelical churches toward spirit
ualism is due to the fact that they recognize in
the outcome from the spiritualistic hypothesis
the implacable enemy of their creeds.â ll. V.
Sweringen, Spiritualist, Fort Wayne, Ind.
POLITICIANS.
Unless a man is saved from political sin he is
not saved at all. A man cannot be a clean
Christian and a dirty politician at the same
time. Christianity touches humanity on every
side. The church has to do with society and
the church has to do with the body politic-
Rev. P. S. Hulbert, Congregationalism Oak
Park, 111.
AMERICANISM.
To be an American is to believe in America
and the American people. To be an American
' is to have an abiding iaith in the future and
I in the destiny of America. To be an American
j is to have a high conception of what this great
country should be, and following out thtit
! ideal loyally.â Rev. John 11. Prugh, Reformed
i Church, Pittsburg, Pa.
DIVORCE.
If the relations of man and wife were such as
they ought to be, divorce would be unknown.
I To prevent separation and divorce true love
i must be given a new and practical formula
I when the novelty subsides, instead ol ice
cream and caramels, let it take the form of
bread, butter and meat. â Rev. \V. W. Morton,
Presbyterian, Allegheny, pa.
LABOR AND RELIGION.
The labor question is a religious one. The
only "workingman's friend" is the man who is
just and kind. Laborers do not want alms
but justice. The church lays its claim upon
the workinsman because it is an institution
whose whole business it is to strengthen and
develop those sentiments that are his truest
helpers.â Rev. Frank Crane, Methodist,
Chicago, 111.
MORAL GENIUS.
The most invincible thing in the world is
moral genius. The timid lose their faith on
the sllgntest provocation. To feel and see all
the world's evils and to hold on to one's faith
in goodness and justice is moral genius. This
is the faith againÂ«t which the gates of hell
shall not prevail.â M. M. Mangasarian, Ethical
Culture Society, Chicago, 111.
IMMORTAL MAN.
A man. No line can measure him. No limit
can bound him. The archangel before the
throne cannot outlive him. The stars shall
die, but he will watch their extinguishment.
The world will burn, but he will gaze at the
conflagration. Endless ages will march on;
he will watch tne procession. A man ! The
masterpiece of God Almighty.â Rev. T. DeWitt,
Talmage, Washington, D. C.
INVESTIGATION.
Man seeking day after day in the catacombs
of life is confronted with exhibitions he can
not understand, and thus is awakened the
mental and spiritual forces of his nature, and
he stands on a plane of intelligence imparted
by that plane of spirit, and nothing more. We
believe it is right and man's duty to investi
gate all avenues of knowledge.â Dr. C. G. Ewell,
Spiritualist, Denver, Colo.
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLB .
The future prosperity of our Nation depends
entirely upon tne training and education of
the youth of the present day. Our public
school system, thoueh we do not claim it to be
perfect, is, I think, the best the world ever
saw. It tends to elevate all classes and condi
tion* of mankind, foreign and native born,
black and white.â Rev. Dr. Peters, Reformed
Church, York, Pa.
â WEALTH.
Riches give early pleasures that often destroy
the soul. It is like trying to f^ed a humming
bird on meai to try to satisfy the hungry soul
on eaily pleasures cr with riches. The sleep of
the laboring man is sweet, whether he eat lit
tle or much, but the abundance cf the rich will
not suffer him to sleep.â Rev. J. S. Martin,
Methodist, New Castle, la.
THE Hr.MAX.
Humanity is naturally so material, so limit
ed in its view, that only God in the flesh would
adequately bring man and the all-just Father
into oneness. The incarnation is an inextric
able mystery, but not more so than the funda
mental principles of our life. It requires great
er laith or degree of credulity to account for
Christ as a more man than as the God man.â
Rev. O. F. Bartholow, Methodist, Brooklyn,
N. Y.
HELL.
There is a hellâ not the old materialistic
brimstone and lire prison, but, like the king
dom of heaven, it is within man. Its purpose
is not to scare him or drive him into being
good, but to make him so uncomfortable in his
sins that, he will gladly come out of the haunts
of wickedness and dwell in the light of love
and good will.â Rev. C. R. East, Universalist
Kansas City, Mo.
PRAYER.
You may prostrate yourself in the dust, you
may sit in sackcloth and ashes, you may rise
from your bed and spend the hours of sleep in
waketul vigils; you may stand as did the
Pharisee at the very altar of God, and speak
loud-sounding prayers, and if your heart is not
in your words you have not prayed.â Rev. W.
P. Swartz, Presbyterian, Wilmington, Del.
LENT.
Lent is forty days of starvation. I don't be
iieve In systematic fasting. I stand here to op
pose all things thst attempt to shadow human
ity. There is enough sadness without teaching
men to submit to forty days of sorrow. Get ah
the hope you can; there is despair enough.
Get all the light you can; there is shadow
enough in the world.â Rev. E. M. Wood, Meth
odist, Pittsburg, la.
HELL.
Hell is peopled with the cold and neglectful,
the sinful and corrupt, and if the cries of the
damned could be lieard there would issue
earthward the wailings of those who spurned
the means of sanctiheation while in the flesh,
and who foolishly imagined that though fhey
outraged the laws of Christianity they would
not hear the fearful words of a just God.â Rev.
Father Curry, Catholic, Philadelphia, Pa.
CONFESSION.
It is no use to confess yonr sins and then
proceed to live the same life over again. You
must have sorrow. You must know and feel
that yon have offended God. This cannot be
palliated by the mere formality of confessing
yonr sins. If you want them to be fojgiven
you must have contrition and be firmly re
solved to sin no more.â Rev. C. E. Woodman,
Catholic, Philadelphia, Pa.
EVOI.I'TION.
We are all evolutionists, but not all of us are
radical evolutionists. The radical evolution
ist believes that all the processes of God are
growth, and that all forms of life have sprung
from primordial types. Man, he believes, is
no exception to the" rule. As he sees the indi
vidual of the race develop from the embryo,
so does he believe the race has developed. I
am a radical evolutionist.â Rev. Lyman Ab
bott, Congregallonalist, Brooklyn, N. Y.
MODERN INFIDELITY.
Where does infidelity get its ideas of justice,
mercy and truth? I say it has stolen them
from Christianity. Where do men get their
ideas of morality except from the Bible?, Every
man worships something. Even infidels wor
ship lngersoll. They must think as he thinks,
do as he does and imitate his weaknesses.
About all they get is his doubt, and his doubt
means desolation and damnation to the soul.â
Rev. F. W. Jacobs, evangelist, Seattle, Wash.
TRt'TH AND LOVE.
We must learn to abolish all class distinc
tions. God is no respecter of persons," end if
we are to be godlike we must not care for
learning, or position, or wealth, but first have
our greatest care for integrity of character.
We must learn to present the trutn more
simply and practically and in a spirit of love
and earnestness that will do much to recom
mend it to those who have not learned to work
out their own problems.â Rev. W. L. Gladisb,
Swedenborgian, Indianapolis, Ind.
A SINGLE-TAX FRKACIIER.
Equal rights without equal opportunities
serve as fine themes for patriotic holidays, but
do not solve the real problems of society or
industry. Equal rights flatter our National
and individual egotism, but do not feed the
starving masses, provide work for those who
are out of work, or give a real ballot to the
hoodwinked and practically disfrancnised vo
ters of the country. The real struggle is now,
or should be, for equal opportunities.â Rev. R.
A. White, Universalist, Chicago.
CITY LIFE.
The city is the battlefield of the hour, and
will become more so as humanity gathers in
I ffreat masses in city life. There is a Provi.
â¢ience in the human desire to gather in multi
tudes in commercial centers, ft seems strange
that humanity, like ripe fruit, decays faster in
heaps than in any other form. We have not as
vet found the secret of savine cities. â Rev. Dr.
Hickman, Methodist, Terre Haute, Ind.
CHURCH AND STATE.
The church is older than the state, and,
while both are divine institutions, right devel
opment and administration of the affairs of
state depend largely upon the cnurch. The
state is to look afterthe secular and temporal
interest of man, and the church his eternal
and spiritual welfare. The state regards man's
home upon earth ; the church points toward
heaven. The state rules by justice, the church,
by love. The state commands and compels
obedience, the church uses moral suasion and
exhortation. The state is the law, the church
is the gospel.â Rev. Sidney Ussher, Westches
ter, Pa.
MARRIAGE.
We all concede the marriage relation to be
the most sacred man can enter upon on this
earth. But even this does not and cannot sat
isfy our deepest needs. The best and truest
companionship is that we have with God.
Loneliness of soul and spirit has led many a
man and woman to God, to have that compan
ionship %vhich alone is satisfying to the soul of
the Christian. The marriage relation is but a
type of the union of man's soul with God. On
earth a man looks for an ideal helpmate, but
he finds his true helpmate in the Christ of the
gospel.â Rev. Dr. Holway, Congregationaliet,
Worcester, Mass.
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
The great triumphant principle of onr Ameri
can Christianity is that it is an independent,
self-supporting", self-governing church in a
free country, existing independently of the
church, but at the same time in perfect har
mony and friendly relationship with it. By
our American principle persecution is made
impossible, because man has religious liberty
in the fullest sense, in thought, speech and
action so long as he does not interfere with
public peace and order. America recognizes
religion as purely voluntary. She accords the
same freedom to religious liberty that she does
to civil liberty, without regard to creed, sect
or party.â Rev..B. N, Ussher, Methodist, West
chester, Pa.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The wheelmen have a very extensive
programme of road races for to-morrow,
and if the weather remains fine the cyclists
will take the country by storm.
The Los Angeies pigeon-shooting tour
nament commenced yesterday. Several
trap-shooting events are slated for to
morrow at Oakland and Alarneda.
The Olympic Club's boxing tournament;
the National Athletic Club's special
matches, and the Colma Club's 20-round
contest, all of which will be held next
month, prove conclusively that boxine is
far from being under the sod in this City.
The angling season will be opened on
the Ist of April, and great preparations
are being made by the devotees of the
paEtime for an outing in the country.
Several interesting matches will be de
cided at Shell Mound Park to-morrow by
the lovers of rifle-shooting.
Two crews from the South End Rowing
Club will row a match race over the Long
Bridge course to-morrow.
THE WHEELMEN.
The Clubs Will Try Out Their Men
for the Relay Race To-Morrow.

A special meeting of the board of gov

WILLIAM YEOMAN, A CRACKAJACK OF THE RELIANCE CLUB.
cling Clubs will be held at the Olympic
Club Monday evening, March 23, to de
cide upon the question of postponing the
relay race one week on account of its date,
April 5, falling on Easter Sunday. Other
matters pertaining to the race will also be
brought up for discussion. This meeting
is an important one and all delegates
should attend.
Some bright mind, with a penchant for
looking up advance dates, and a familiar
ity with the dates of particular religious
services heretofore unknown in wheelmen,
discovered about a week ago that the first
Sunday in April, on which day the relay
race is annually run, would be Easter Sun
day. The large body of wheelmen are in
favor of adrancing the date one week this
year, for while they have no scruples
against riding the race on that particular
Sunday, it is admitted that in the eyes of
the general public the race will attract
more interest and be more favorably
thought of if not contested on that day.
It has been suggested some people attend
religious services on Easter Sunday who
may perhaps not go any other day of the j
year, and the relay would serve to attract ]
them from their annual devotions.
It is believed that the date can be
changed, thoueh it will take the unani
mous vote of every delegate to the asso
ciation to so decide, that being the tenor
of the by-laws. Wheelmen as a rule, and
particularly organized wheelmen, such as
the associated clubs, are law-abiding, God
fearing citizens, and they can be depended
upon to do that which is right by them
selves and the public, as they are in the
sport to raise, not to lower it.
Professionalism is gaining in favor.
This information is gleaned from Eastern
press reports. But one thing is noticed,
the National racing board has thus far
received but few applications for sanctions
for race meets this season. La?t year at
this time the board was flooded witn appli
cations. Most of the cycle meet pro
motets are gauging the question before
concluding to offer cold prizes. Shall it
be all amateur or all professional events,
half of each, or wnat? On this coast it
will largely depend on how many of the
fast riders "enter the professional class. It
is a fact that more interest at
tached to the one professional race at
the recent indoor tournament than to all
the other events that particular evening.
Possibly this was because it was the first
professional race under the new rules, but
more likely because of the known ability
of the riders. If most of the class B men
of last year enter professionalism, the meet
which promotes the most of that class of
races is the one which will draw the larg
est crowds of spectators. There is to be
held in Toledo, Ohio, the coining summer
a meet in which $5000 in prizes will be
given away in three days' racing, most of
which is cash, for professional events.
If brakes on bicycles would really serve
to prevent accidjents, bicycle riders would
be the first to want them. The man on a
wheel does not want to participate in acci
dents any more than Drake agitators want
to have liim.
Captain Fawcett of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen says that if it does not rain to
day the postponed run of the club from
last Sunday will beheld to-morrow to Red
wood City ,'taking. the 1U:52 train at Valen
cia street* for Milbrae, wheeling from there
to Redwood at an easy pace. On the way x
down there will be a five-mile try-out oveV
the San Mateo course, and after a lunch a
two-mile handicap race (for which six
prizes are offered) and an impromptu base
ball game.
The Intercollegiate Athletic Association
appreciates the advantages of wheel con
tests, and will hold a separate tournament
this year. Racing men will be developed
from the colleges, and some good ones ruay
be expected, riders who otherwise would
not become competitors for track honors.
If the weai her is pleasant to-morrow
and it does not rain to amount to anything
to-day there will be three ten-mile road
races held over at San Leandro to-morrow.
The riders of the Bay City Wheelmen will
compete in a ten-mile handicap event from
Fruitvale to Hay wards and Captain Plum
mer has called a club run to go over on
the 9 o'clock boat. All of the best men of
the club will ride. The California Cycling
Club men will ride ten miles around the
San Leandro triangle, going over on the 8
o'clock boat, and the result of this race
will determine the club's team in the
coming relay. The Imperial Cycling Club
riders will race from Frnitvale to Hay
wards in a ten-mile handicap event and
men who aspire to positions on this club's
relay team must ride in this try-out. They
will also go over on the 9 o'clock broad
gauge boat.
Application blank and pamphlet show
ing the benefits to be derived from mem
bership in the League of American Wheel
men can be had by addressing a postal to
the cycling editor of The Call. The
league now has 1233 members in this State,
an increase of twenty-five during the past
week. Chief ConsuJ Kerrigan is getting
out a new handbook for league members.
which will be ready for distribution
: shortly.
Daniel O'Callaghan, one of the charter
members of the Bay City Wheelmen, re
! turned from his trip around the world
j Thursday night and was warmly greeted
1 by his fellow-members, who met him at
the ferry. He has had a variety of ex
, periences, and a very jolfy time alto
j gethor, and proposes to come around to
; the clubhouse some night next week and
tell the boys all about his trip.
William' Yeoman of the Reliance Club

1 and yet won the fewest prizes. He was
I always put on the scratch mark in the
i handicap events, and would climb up to
! about second position. So it was in the
! semi-finals and finals. In the scratch
j races Edwards, Wells and other men of his
class could outaprint him at the tape, and.
; therefore, while showing as much speed
I and endurance as any of them in a race,
> he was invariably beaten at the finish by
I a few inches because he could not sprint.
! Yeoman broke the world's indoorcompeti
â¢ tion mile record at the Pavilion track on
I March 6, covering the distance in 2:J4 1-5.
j This time was afterward bettered by
I Wells, the Bay City flyer. Yeoman rode

March 12. covering a half mile in 1:02 4-5
| and a mile in 2:16, both world's indoor
â  records for the distance and conditions.
R. M. Welch, member of the National
'. racing board, has issued another bulletin,
; whicn as usual is interesting. It will be
j noticed that W. W. Needham of the Olym-
I pic Clob Wheelmen has been transferred
! to the professional cla,-Â«s by Mr. Welch
under clause B. This is because Needham
assisted in the training and riding of the
ladies who contested in the women's
three days' meet at the Pavilion last week
i which proved such a fiasco. However,
Needhara is a pretty speedy rider and will
i doubtless show up well among the "pros."
He is not so unfortunate as was Oscar
Osen last year, for now he will have lots
; of company among the riders of the coast,
and good company at that.
Mr. Welch's bulletin is as follows:
BULLETIN NO. 4.
March 20, 1896.
Sanctions grantedâ April 30, May 1 and 2,

professional, but as soon as he becomes a figure
on the racing path he invites the investigation
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 189(T.
of the board. The undersigned, as a member
of the board in dealing with such cases, will
hold that racing men connected with the trade
iii any capacity enjoy advantages that other
men as amateurs cannot command.
R. M. Welch,
Member National Racing Board.
The ranks of the women riders will be
greatly augmented this year by myriads
of new recruits. Physicians freely recom
mend the wheel lor them, and thousands
of fair devotees will seek health and recre
ation astride their bikes this season.
Toward the latter part of last year the in
crease in the number of women riders who
frequented the park and the near-by coun
try roads was very noticeable, and it is ex
pected that this spring and summer will
see them riding everywhere that the men
do, and with as muchcomfort and pleasure.
The Haywards electric road will run a
special bicycle train on and after to-mor
row on Sundays only for the special ac
commodation of bicycle-riders and their
wheels, leaving Haywards at 4:01 p. M. No
charge -will be made for carrying wheels.
This train is put on for the benefit of those
who may wish to make the trip to Hay
wards, but who do not care to undertake
the homeward ride against prevailing
head winds; also for those whose wheels
may have suffered some mishap, and for
ladies who fee] [that the complete run of
twenty-tive miles or so would overtax
their strength, but who have confidence in
their ability to make the trip one way.
The leaving times of this special bicycle
train from the various points on the line
will be as follows: Haywards clubhouse,
4:0 i; Haywards, B street, 4:04; Castro
Valley junction, 4:11; San Lorenzo junc
tion, 4:18; San Leandro, 4:26; .Elmhurst,
4:34; Fitchburg, 4:41; Seminary avenue,
4:44. This train is a great accommodation
to the wheeling public and will doubtless
be used considerably.
It is best to use the ankle in pedaling,
particularly when climbing hills. The
ankle motion is hard to adopt, but wheu
once the knack is learned it will greatly
relieve the wheelman ascending elevations.
Upturned handlebars also facilitate the
art. It is also a good way to develop the
calf of the leg.
If the weather is fair the members of the
San Francisco Road Club will ride to San
Mateo to-morrow. On the way down the
club will hold a try-out over the course of ;
the second relay. * Captain Pixley expects j
a large turnout, but it all depends upon the
weather.
The regular monthly meeting of the
North California Division, League of Amer
ican Wheelmen will be held this evening
at the rooms of the Garden City Cyclers,
San Jose, at 8 o'clock. Important busi
ness is to be transacted and the attend
ance of all delegates is earnestly requested
by the chief consul.
The Garden City Cyclers' five-mile hand
icap road race scheduled for to-morrow i
from Morgan Hill to San Martine has been
postponed until after the relay. Otto
Ziegler Jr. will then ride from scratch,
paced by tandems, and will endeavor to
lower the world's five-mile record, now
held by George Hanilin of the San Fran
cijco Road Cl-Ã¼b. Spalding.
THE BOXERS.
Choynski's Chances of Whipping
Sharkey.
The next event of importance in the
way of boxing will be a meeting between
Tom Sharkey, the champion heavy-weight
of the Pacific Coast, and Joe Choynski.
The contest will be held in this City on
the evening of tne 16th of April, and ac
cording to an agreement signed by "Par
son" Davies in behalf of ChoynsKi and
Sharkey, Choynski, to win the long end
of the purse that will be hung up for com
petition, must stop Sharkey in eight
rounds.
There are many people under the im
pression that Choynski can easily accom
plish the trick of polishing off his oppo
nent in a couple of rounds. No later than
yesterday a well-known sage, who is con
sidered an authority on matters pugilistic,
said that the champion of Uncle Sam's
navy would be treated by Choynski in the
exa't same manner as the elongated New
Zealnnder. Fitzsimmons, treated the once
redoubtable Peter Maher.
"Yes, you mark my words," said the
sage, '"that Joe will fool around Tom until
he locates the uninclosed spots that are
open for inspection on his handsome face,
and then, as quick as greased lightning
strikes an oldtime Democratic ward poli
tician, Joseph will send out that big sledge
hammer tist of his and poor old Tom will
fall down, down, down on the cold, cold
floor, where he will lie like a good Indian
until the seconds are called and the purse
is won. I say that Sharkey will be de
feated in quick order, but I would change
my opinion very quickly if I thought
Sharkey was clever enough to guard his
jaw from the heavy shot whicn Joseph
carries in his gloves."
It is strange how people will sometimes
be carried away with impressions formed
in years that are past. They seemingly
forget that a fighter, like a horse, will
grow stale from too much work, and after
a certain number of years on the turf he is
bound to retrograde.
Cnoynski is a pretty old star now. He
has been seven or eight years in the ring,
so to speak, and ten years is about the
limit of a pugilist's successful career.
Joseph is a good man yet. and will remain
a hard puncher after Corbett's brilliant
star of fortune has set forever.
It must be remembered that Choynski
takes excellent care of himself, and does
not indulge in wild escapades. He is
physically almost as good a man to-day as
he was eignt years ago. but then he is
growing old, and will not go as good a
race now as when he met the now famous
Jimmy Corbett in that memorable prize
fight on a barge in Carquinez Straits.
Choynski has had several hard battles
since that time, and it cannot be said that
those contests have helped him in anyway
excepting what he may have gained in
know'c-dge and experience, which is very
material.
Sharkey is a youne and powerful fellow
and as game as a Japanese fighting bird.
He is aware that he has yet much to learn
about the game of fisticuffs, but being a
close student and a lovsr of hard exercise
he hopes to overcome whatever awkward
ness he may possess, and eventually prove
to the sporting public that he is entitled
to a place in the first rank of heavy-weight
pugilists.
Choynski will not have as easy a game
as many people imagine, and *it is ex
tremely doubtful if tie can land his big
right tist on the spot he expects to reach
during the eight rounds of his engagement
with Mharkey.
Certainly, if he has not made wonderful
strides in improvement since he fought
Billy Woods in this City, Sharkey will
stand some kind of a chance of turning the
tables on his opponent.
Choynski, in hot company, will not prove
a dangerous man after five rounds of sharp
fighting. His underpinning is very light,
and in build he is not to be compared with
Sharkey in athletic proportions. .
Choynski is said to be in good condition
now and will require only a few weeks'
training to fit him for a battle royal.
The London National Sportiiis Club,
which is composed of many millionaires
and prominent men in business circles, is
now figuring on a match between Corbett
and Fitzsimmons.
Considering that the gentlemen of this
famous athletic association are as intelli
gent and as humanely inclined as the good
people of Texas who opposed the Fitzsim
mons and Maher contest, it must be sur
prising to those who do not believe in box
ing that the London ciub would, even tol
erate a boxing match for the supposed
championship of the world between such
prominent individuals. But neither the
members of the club nor the venerable
diplomats and aged statesmen of the
House of Commons or Parliament can see
any harm in two thoroughly trained and
well conditioned men meeting in tne roped
arena to decide questions of physical su
periority, and it is very safe to say that
they would not neglect National affairs of
importance either to meddle in the local
affairs of others. So much cannot be said
of our silver-tongued orators and states
men who permitted the sacred affairs of a
Nation to tremble while they came down
from their "lofty perches'.' to enact special
laws which brand the patrons of the
"manly art" as felons.
In case Corbett and Fitzsimmons are
ANGLERS WHO 3IADE LARGE CATCHES OF STEELHEADS IN RUSSIAN RIVER.
matched to box the winner must fi>ht
Peter Jackson before he can sign his name
"champion" of either America, England
or Australia.
The Call explained some weeks ago why
Peter Jackson is more entitled to the honor
of champion than any man looking for that
distinction. This is what a prominent East
ern sporting paper has to say on the subject :
If all goes well and both men are alive they
will meet in the sporting club of London not to
decide the question of the world's champion
ship as many people think, as neither of these
men holds that title. That title cannot possi
bly be at stake. The winner of this battle will
be the possessor of an immense purse and
nothing more. How can these men have the
audacity to say they are champions of the
world while that sturdy black Hercules, Peter
Jackson, is still in the ring? Is he not cham
pion of Australia by virtue of his vic
tory over Frank Slavin? And . cham
pion of England by his defeat of Jem
Smith? And dÂ«d he not fight James Corbett
sixty-one rounds to a draw? And if he is the
champion of England and Australia, and even
with the champion of America, why is he not
entitled to a place in the race for the cham
pionship honors? Who can truthfully say
he is champion of the world until he de
feats Peter Jackson? That grim old werrlor
is not to be considered a thing of the past. It
was entirely due to the scathine and saroastic
tongue of j. J. Corbett that this noble old
warrior has sunk from the pugilistic firma
ment. But his oblivion is not complete. Pri
vate advices are at hand which tell us he is
taking good care of himself, and will soon be
heard from again. Let the winner of the
Corbett-Fitz fight beat Peter Jackson, and then
we will see for the first time a world's cham
pion heavy-weight pugilist.
THE ANGLERS.
Streams That Will Be In Good Con-
dltlon on Opening Day.
The angling days are close at hand and
should a rainstorm hold off until the Ist
prox. a very successful opening of the trout
season will certainly result.
Judging from letters that have been re
ceived at this office from various parts of
the country where trout streams are
numerous, the prospects for well-filled
baskets could not be better. A gentleman
who writes from Pieta says that the stream
which empties into Russian River near
Pieta station is literally alive with trout of
good size, and that owing to a long spell of
warm weather the fish are rising to flies,
and that pood stream-whipping may be
expected provided a change in the weather
will not take place before April 1.
Similar reports have arrived from many
of the interior towns within close distance
of trout streams.
According to the present appearance of
the weather, rain is not far distant, and it
is not by any means improbable that the
streams which have been in the mind's
eye of anglers for some weeks will be high
and muddy when the day for rods, reels
and rubber-boots will arrive. John Butler
received a dispatch from Al Hall of Point
Reyes last "Wednesday that the Paper Mill
was clearing rapidly and that a fresh run
of small fish had arrived. This welcome
intelligence will certainly cause a rush of
small-fish anglers to the place in question
to-morrow.
The picture which accompanies this de
partment of sport is from a photograph
taken recently by Dr. yon Hoffman on the
strand of Russian River, near Duncans
Mills. The anglers who, with par
donable pride, hold ten-pound steel
heads while the artist is taking a snap
shot are Al Wilson, Otto Muser, J. Cross
and Is. Turner, all noted disciples of Wal
ton. Wilson has probably killed more
large fish with a rod than any angler of
this coast. Two years ago he landed a
sturgeon from the Russian that weighed
223 pounds. It took him exactly one hour
and fifty-three minutes to conquer the
prize.
Mr. Muser is also a well-known angler
who believes in fishing as being the most
enjoyable and healthful of all outdoor
sports. Among some of the many anglors
of this City who owe their success in fly
casting end playing of large fishes to the
instructions they received from Mr. Muser
in days that are past are John Butler,
alias "Panther John," John Lemmer,
Henry Peckham, John Bergez, Charley
Green, Frank Marcus, etc. Mr. Muser has
to his credit the largest catch of seel heads
that has ever been made in Salmon Creek.
Messrs. Turner and Crass are prominently
connected with t he sport of angling on
this coast.
Messrs. Curley, Green and Thompson
visited Duncans^Mills last Sunday and on
their return some practical joker tele
phoned to Curley's partner, Ferguson,
lrom San Rafael, to have a wagon at the
wharf on the arrival of the Sausalito boat,
a3 the anglers had more fish than they
could possibly handle.
The wagon was waitinz the arrival in
the City of the disciples of bait fishing, and
the most surprised man on earth was Cur
ley when the driver asked him where his
load was:
"What load do you mean, sir?" gruffly
demanded Curley ; '"don't I look all right ?'*
"Oh, you misunderstood me, sir," re
plied the t>oor, old driver, who was
momentarily expecting a cuff on the ear,
"it is your big load of iisn I am after; Mr.
Ferguson has sent messenger-boys all over
town to inform your friends to be at the
rendezvous at 8 o'clock, as Curley was
cominsr to town loaded with lish for every
body."
Curley did have one nice fish in his pos
session, the first he had ever caught. He
borrowed a bicycle from a saloon-keeper
on the front and rode up through the
principal streets with the ten-pounu steel
liead dangling from the bandies of his
bike. The poor old driver was cheated
out of a good thing, all because Mr. Curley
did not have as many tisis as Mr. Ferguson
had supposed.
The latter had to stand the price of an
empty wagon-drive, and Curlej' now says
that he wbo laughs last laughs best. Fer
guson will be the next to tiy nis luck in
steel beading, so Professor Nat says, and
his word cannot be disputed.
Local anglers and members of the San
Francisco Rod and Gun Club will be
pleased to learn tliat Otto Braunsdorf has
sufficiently recovered from a 9evere attack
of liver complaint to be up and doinf.
His presence was certainly missed from
favorite old fishing grounds in the vicinity
of Point Reyes.
Fred Surrhyne would be pleased to
know where "Doc" Watt will cast his first
line of the season on April 1. He states
that it would give him inestimable pleas
ure to accompany Mr. Watt on his inau
gural outing.
Jack Lernmer, Ed Sullivan and Jack
Sanimi have been informed by Tommy
Irvine that for bait fishing the best cork
that can be used is the stoppe*r of a cham
pagne-bottle.
THE GUN.
The Lincoln and Olympic Qun Club
Teams Are Matched.
A series of team shoots for a trophy
have been arranged between the Lincoln
and Olympic Gun clubs, to take place on
the fourth Sunday of each month, com
mencing on the 29tb inst.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
| will soon be strengthened by a club of 100
I members which was recently formed in
j Eureka, Humboldt County. Mr. Munroe
; of Fortuna states that the gun clubs of
1 Eureka, which are composed of wealthy
men, are gradually taking the duck
shooting grounds about Eureka away
from the sportsmen who cannot afford to
right them in the courts.
The Protective Association will give a
picnic at bchuetzen Park, San Rafael, next
month, and President Ahem says that he
does not know how he can dispose of the
many prizes he has received from friends
of the association. There will be over
fifty gate prizes. The proceeds of the pic
! nie will materially strengthen the treasury
! of the club, which is now in a veryflour
j ishing condition.
"King" McManus and Charley O'Maley
Baines had a very successful cottontail
| rabbit shoot near the Cliff House last Sun

: men's Protective Association, is indebted
j to "the King" fora mess of rabbits, which
i were received in splendid condition.

; The tournament commenced yesterday
and will enu on Sunday.
Contra Costa Countyis one of the coun
ties that refused to appoint a game warden
; this year. The fines paid into the county

i Pish Commissioners amounts to over $700
i âenough to have paid tne salary of a game

I that a warden is needed.
There will be trap-shooting contests to

its annual prize-shooting contests for $250
in prizes on the honorary target.
The police teams of San Francisco and
Oakland practice daily at Shell Mound for
their match, which will be contested on
Saturday, the 28th inst. It is said that
there are some very good marksmen in the
Oakland team who will run up big scores
when the time arrives for business.

THE OARSMEN.
South End Boat Club's Four-Oared
Barge Race.
John Elliot, the champion of strictly
amateur sports and a prominent member
of the Olympic Club, is of the opinion
that rowing is now one of the recognized
popular sports on this coast, second only
to bicycling.
He says tnat the Pacific Athletic Associ
ation has formed a set of rules to govern a
1 repatta and that in the future a champion
ship regatta vnll be held by the association
| yearly.
It is only of late that Mr. Elliot became
interested in rowing, heretofore not think
ing it was a very exciting sport, but since
he has witnessed the crowds that attended
the Stockton, El Campo and Lake Merritt
regattas be has become a boating enthusi
ast and will do all in his power to further
the interests of the sport in the future.
The Olympic Club boating annex is now
in a nou?ishing condition.
Forty members are enrolled on the
club's roster and $250 has been spent in
\ making improvements on the boathouse
i at Belvedere.
The house has been divided off into
fourteen spacious apartments and a float
costing $50 and capable of carrying fifty
tons has been added to the improvements.
It is the intention of the annex to limit
the membership of the club to fifty at the
regulation initiation fee of $3 and dues of
50 cents a month.

Al Rodgers, the boat-builder, is building
for the Olympics a four-oared racing-shell,
which will be the first four-oared racing
shell ever built on this coast.
It is expected to be completed next
month, when the Olympic crew intend to
make arrangements* for a race with the
University and Columbia crews on May
30, at El Campo.
Last Sunday was ladies' day at the Dol
phin Club and a pleasant day was spent in
boat-racing and swimming. Miss Annie
Crowley furnished musical selections and
George Sullivan and J. Cronin rendered
vocal solos.
The following young ladies were present:
The Misses M. Cornyn, M. Tyndall, F.
Kenny, A. Crowley, M. Fenton. N. Jones,
J. Jones. I. Caruthers, A. Lucitt, E. Kil
duff, M. Schields and J. Lawton.
In the boatraces James Cronin defeated
Fred Woerner in a half mile ontrigger
skiff contest, and John Coughlin gained a
victory over Harry Vanderwater in a one
mile shell race. Adam Schuppert won the
l<XÂ»-yard swimming match from Peter yon
Hadlen.
Those who had charge of the day's sport
were James C*nin, Captain "W. O. Patch
and George Sullivan. The prizes for the
races were new club uniforms.
The Dolphins have now selected their
senior and junior racing crews for the
coming regatta.
They are: Seniorsâ Jack Coughlin,
stroke; Tom Hopkins, after waist ; J. Mar
ron, forward waist ; Joe Laib, bow.
Juniorsâ E. Sullivan, stroke; Fred
Woerner, after waist; R. Giovanni, for
ward waist; W. O. Patch, bow.
Fred Fouzer, Charles Mitchell and Tom
Hopkins joined the club last meeting and
the membership roll is now closed, the
limit of membershipâ sixty â having been
reached.
The Ariel Club has divided the oarsmen
into classes, the novices in class A, the
Becond-class rowers in B and the experts
:n class C. Tryout races will be held every
Sunday.
Should the club's entertainment prove a
success two new outrigger skiffs, which
will be narrower and longer than the
skiffs now in vogue, will be ordered.
It is thought tbat tbe Columbia Boat
Club of Oakland will join the Pacific Ath
letic ' Association at their next regular
meeting.
The all-absorbing topic of conversation
that prevails around the South Â£nd boat
house is that four-oared barge race which
will be held to-morrow.
THE BARGE RACE.
South End Rowing Club's Fou
Oared Contest.
The South End Rowing Club of this
City will hold a grand inter-club barge
race over the Long Bridge course next

have been training for the contest for the
past two rcontbs, and a large amount of
money is up on the result, the betting
sliehtiy favoring the senior crew, who
have won so many laurels for the club dur
ing the past two years.
A most exciting contest is assured, as
the winners of this race will represent the
club in the El Campo regatta on May 30,

The Haywards team has played several
games during the past season and have
proved themselves to be a very strong
body, while the Farraguts of Vallejo have
played several games the past season.
McGuire of the Farraguts is a powerful
athlete and when he starts to buck the
line with the assistance of the half-backs,
Bcullv and McEniry, and Quarter-back
Lee, he generally gains from three to ten
yards.
" The guards, Hobbs and O'Hara, are very
strong and put up a fine game.
The tackles, "Baby 1 ' Hoyt and Cooney,
prove to be very stron? also, as does the
ends. Corcoran and Coombs.
Kavanaugh at center is very strong,
though he is the lightest man in the team.
He does some fine playing.
Tiie Farraguts will briny a large crowd
of enthusiastic people who will yell and
help encourage their team on to victory.

Basket Ball.
The spacious gymnasium of the Y. M.
C. A. was filled With a large and enthusi
astic audience jast evening to witness a
practice game in which the Rushers,
champions of the .Pacific Coast, defeated
the Oakland Y. M. C A. team by a score
of 9to 5. Much of the well-earned victory
is due to the passing and goal-throwing of
Shaw, Spacher and Captain Klarman, who
are undoubtedly the best on the coast in
their respective positions. The Oaklands
played a good up-hill game, particularly
J. Lancaster, middle-center, and in a few
months' time will be strong rivals for
ciuunpiombip honor?. Two halves of
twenty minutes each, with ten minutes'
rest, were played, and it was the first
frame in which the new association league
ball was used. Members of the Business
Men's team officiated in the following
capacities: Homer, referee; Gartlin and
Everding, umpires, and J. Everding, timer.
SACRAMENTO SPORTING.
What the Sportsmen, Cyclists, Ath-
letes and Coursers Are Doing.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 19.â The
trap-shooting season of 1896 promises to be
one of far greater interest in this vicinity
than has been known in years. New clubs
have been organized and old ones have
been rejuvenated and the sports are show
ing up in excellent form, many of the
younger men bidding fair to make records
for themselves which will be hard to sur
pass.
At the 'opening shoot of the Spoonbill
Club, held at Eckhardt's shooting grounds
last Sunday, Sdnle carried off first honors,
with a score of 20 birds, Thomas second
with 19. In the second event, a 15- bird
match. Dainm and Thomas tied on 13
birds, Newbert breaking 12. In the event
at ten birds Soule broke 9, Damm 8. The
opening live-bird shoot of the I'elican
Club also occurred last Sunday, J. M. Mor
rison and J. B. Griffin dividing the honors
with 17 birds each, Captain Ruhstaller
and L. S. Upson killing lt> each. The next
shoot of the Capital City Bluerock Club
will take place to-morrow and is looked
forward to with great interest by local
cracks, as the performance of E. A. Nico
laus, who is looked upon as the coming
shot of this section, is being watched care
fully, and it is believed that if he keeps ud
his form tbe best shots of the State will
have to rustle to be in it with him.
Great preparations are being made for
the big blue rock tournament which will
be held at the Kimble and Upson shooting
grounds on the 29th iust., the programme
being as follows: Ten birds, known trap
and angle, $1 entrance; rifteen birds,
known trap and unknown angle, $2 en
trance; twenty birds, known trau and
angle, $2 50 entrance; twenty birds, known
trap and angle, $90 worth of merchandise
prizes, $2 entrance ; fifteen birds, known
trap aud unknown angle, $1 50 entrance ;
twenty-five birds, known trap and angle,
$2 50 entrance, and ten birds, known trap
and unknown angle, $1 entrance. All
moneys to be divided 50, 60 and 20 per
cent. * Noted shots from all over the State
have promised to be present.
The Sacramento tennis clubs have re
paired their courts and begun practice.
They expect to give a good account oi
themselves during the coming season.
The 13v^-mile handicap road race of the
Capital City Wheelmen will come off to
morrow if the weather permits. The
handicaps will be given out to-night. En
tries will probably be as follows: Chris
Ecklon, George Readman, George Jackson,
Lester Young, Thomas Welsh, L. Payne,
E. Wilson, Henry Conklin, William
Hubert, E. Pope, B. Milne and E. Leaoh.
Gearge Readman, the captain of the Capi
tal City Wheelmen, is considered to be the
strongest rider, and Louis Payne, W T ii)iam
Hubert and Chris Ecklon come next in the
list.
C. W. Conger and L. S. Upson paced
over the 14-mile course which will be run
on Sunday, making the distance in 39 min
utes.
Preparations are being made for a road
race between the Sacramento and Stockton
clubs, to be run on the 26th of April. The
distance to be covered is 104 miles. There
will be seven relays which will be placed
thi3 coming week.
The last cocking main of five battles re
sulted in a draw, each side taking two bat
tles and the fifth being a tie.
The Sacramento High School will hold
a field day at Agricultural Park on April
4. The events will be 100, 220, 440 and 120
yard dashes, the latter being over hurdles,
a half-mile running race, a mile running
race, broad jump, running high jump,
pole-vaulting, shot-putting, hammer and
baseball throwing, one-mile and two-mile

WILL BE GRANTED TIME
Supervisors Are Not in Favor
of Hurrying the Hog
Ranchers.
The Committee Will Probably Report
in Favor of a Six Months'
Delay.
Two additional petitions against per
mitting the hog ranohes to remain within
the districts where they are now located
were filed with the Board of Supervisors
yesterday.
One was from the residents of Excelsior
Homestead, where some of the worst nui
sances of this character have been re
ported, and the other from the Spring
Valley Homestead on Islais Creek.
The property-owners in both instances
claim that the stench from the ranches
renders life almost unbearable to them,
endangers the lives of the members of
their families and depreciates the value of
their property. At the meeting of the
Health and Police Committee of the
board yesterday the petitions previously
received were placed on file, the matter
being in the hands of a special committee
with instructions to report to the board.
This committee, which consistsof Super
visors Hobbs, Waener and King, has
visited a number of the places complained
of in search of information and experience
on which to base a report. It is probable
that the committee will report in favor of
allowing the ranchers six months in which
to find new locations and remove their
porcine chattels to them. Supervisors
King and Wagner are known to favor the
ranchers, and Supervisor Hobbs is also
inclined to think that it would work a
hardship on the hog-raisers to force them
to move on short notice.
"There is no question about these
ranches being a nuisance," said the latter
yesterday. "The stench that arises is
simply horrible and, it appears to me,
calculated to breeed disease. Still I think
that these men should be given time to
find other land on which to raise their
hogs, if we can be assured that they will
leave peaceably when their time is up."
SOCIALISTS AND SUFFRAGE.
MiÃÃ Anthony and Mrs. Sargent Addrem
1 iic American Brunch.
Miss Susan B. Anthony addressed the
Society of American Socialists last even
ing and her address was supplemented by
a practical talk by Mrs. A. A. Sargent.
There was a large audience, chiefly of the
unbonneted class of listeners.
The well-known suffrage leader gave a
brief history of the development of gov
ernment and said she saw no necessity of
making an argument for equal suffrage to
socialists, for she understood that they
had incorporated such a plank in their
platform.
A black-eyed, black-bearded man who
sat in the front row assured her that such
Wfcfl not the case. "There are lots of them
in this hall who don't believe in it, whether
they say so or not," he insisted. Then the
lady proceeded with the argument.
A man in the audience asked Miss An
thony what effect suffrage wquJd have on
the industrial questionâ that is. on the un
employed. There was derisive laughter on
the part of the audience. The lady re
plied that she did not know how it would
affect the unemployed, but as for the em
ployed the women were helpless without
the power of the ballot.
Another interested listener wanted to
know whether since women constitute
three-quarters of the church membership,
under a feminine vote the Government
would not become one of ministers. Miss
Anthony thought not. but that women
would vote for the most moral men.

BLUE ROCK HILL MUST GO
Progressive Improvements Mark
a New Era in the Potrero
Section.
MAKING SITES FOB, HOMES.
The Heirs of the Hearst Estate Ex
pending Money in Beautifying
the South Side.
The Potrero section is not being neg
lected in so far as the progressive spirit of
improvement goes. The Potrero Land and
Water Company is working a gang of fifty
men on the Minnesota-street side of Blue-
rock Hill in filling up the hollow that lies
west of that street and south of Sierra and
Napa to the northern line of the rope
works.
This property belongs to the estate of
the late Senator Hearst and will when filled
in make desirable building lots, increasing
not only the vaiueof the property thus
improved, but also the adjacent location.
This prospective view cnn be seen from
the fact that a lot 25 by 100 feet adjoining
the Potrero public school on Minnesota
street was sold Tor $1300. This same lot a
few years ago and before it was rilled in
was worth comparatively speaking noth
ing as a residence site.
The principal object of this filling-in pro
cess is to remove the unsightly blue.rock
knob which faces Napa street. This blue
rock promontorybeiongs to ex-Supervisor
Christian Reis and his brothers. They
in turn are co-operating with the Hearst
heirs in the work ot improvement. The
one will level what the other needs to fill
in with.
In addition to this work Contractor
Whitley will start a gang of thirty men to
work wxt week lo grade and fill in the
declivities on Mission street, between
Solano and Mariposa and between Missis
sippi street and Pennsylvania avenue. This
undertaking will give 'employment to quite
a number of men during the spring and
summer months, and will, when finished,
leave desirable lots for building purposes â
a necessity that has long been felt in'that
portion of "the City.
The work of removing Bluerock Hill to
the adjoining swamp ground is not a diffi
cult undertaking, as the rocK yields easily
to the pick, and its removal is done by a
train of cars run on a railway track by an
endJes3 wire cable drawn on a drum at the
base of the works. The loaded cars in
descending haul tne. empty ones up to the
platform, where they in turn are filled and
dispatched.
At the present rate of progress and im
provements in tue Potrero it will not be
many years until Bluerock Hill will be re
moved to fill in the adjacent hollows and
elegant residences and business stores will
adorn the crown of Potrero Heights.

AFTER THE DOCTOR'S COIN
Surgeon Bowie of the Belgic
Must Give His Financial
Standing.
Served With an Order of Examina
tion Taken Out on a Default
Judgment.
Dr. Robert J. Bowie, the dashing young
surgeon of the Occidental and Oriental liner
Belgic and brother of Allen St. J. Bowie,
president of the "Western Light and Power
Company, will be asked to appear before a
Justice of the Peace to-day to divulge the
extent and location of his worldly posses
sions, if he has any.
Some years ago Bowie boarded with,
Mrs. Blanche "Wilcox and ran up a big bill
for his keep. When she finally importuned
him to settle he gave her a promissory note
for $175 in payment.
This was two years ago and though the
note called for a settlement within thirty
days the paper was never taken.up. She
assigned her claim to J. J. Ruuer, who ob
tained a judgment by default.
When the collector of bad debts tried to
rind something with which to satisfy the
decree of the court he was unsuccessful.
A deputy Sheriff sent with a garnishment
to intercept tbe doctor's salary from the
company failed to find that any money
was due him and the medico did not ap*
pear to have any valuables that could be
levied upon.
In order to settle for good the surgeon's
financial standing Raver had an order of
examination issued calling upon thÂ« doc
tor to appear before a Justice of the Peace
and explain matters.
As the Belgic sails to-day at the same
hour on which Dr. Bowie is ordered to ap
pear in court it is probable that' some sort
of arrangement will be arrived at in order
that he may be able to sail with the ship.
There are no fewer than 13,000 school
masters in Germany whose salary falls bo
low Â£40 per annum.

KID YORK. MARKETS.
Financial. '
NEW YORK. X. V., March 20. -The transac
tions in stocks to-day aggregated only 160,000
shaies. The trading, a. of late, was confined ex
clusively to the professional operators. The open
ing was weak on Lonoon selling, the attitude
taken l.y France, in the Egyptian matter having
disturbed confidence abroad to some extent. Local
operators were sellers of the grangers, Louisville
and Nashville and certain of the specialties,' but
the offerings :or this account were on a very small
Ecale. a number of unfavorable reports were cir
culated as to the financial standing of leading com
mercial firms here and in Boston. It was even
stated that a National bank was in trouble, but
close investigation failed to develop anything of a
definite character.
â¢ Still the bears were enabled to make some Im
pression on prices and at one time the decline was
equal to > 4"i l 2 percent, Louisville and Nashville,
Tennessee coal, New England, the Grangers and
the Northern Pacifies scoring the greatest losses.
Tobacco displayed considerable strength and on
the revival of reports of an early settlement of the
war with the outside manufacturers the stock rose
from 811/2 to 83%. lv the late trading the
market showed a tendency to improve owing to
covering of short contracts. Sugar, Louisville and
Nashville and the Grangers were quite prominent
at this time. Pacific Mail in the final transactions
Jumped from 25y 2 to 27%- Speculation closed
firm in tone. Net changes show losses of V*Â®y->

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. March 20.â 1t was believed
this morning that Wheat should have a recovery,
the near ending of the week, with probably Â» fair
short interest having been created on the down
turn, â  being the arguments on whic.h the. theory
was based. The unexpected happened, however,
and instead of an advance there was a decline in
prices. The receipts in the Northwest were again
heavy at 509 cars against 330 last Friday and 366
a year ago. Thai and the fact that the cold wave
did not prove a very serious one, were the import
ant considerations affecting the tone. Liverpool
cables were quiet and steady.'
Receipts at Chicago were ten cars and 139,588
bushels were taken from store. Export clearances
were fair at 205,628 bushels. Closing Continental
cables were all lower. About noon prices firmed
and recovered the entire loss of the morning, butt
ing by "shorts" being the strengthening factor.
May wheat opened from 61"Â« cto 62y B e, sold be
tween 6214 c and 615yÂ»c, closing at 62y B cbid,y g @
Vie under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow IS cars. â  â â 'â¢'
CORNâ Was susceptible to weakness to-day, and
sympathy with wheat, therefore, caused prices to
depreciate. The receipts, 429 cars, were large
although not fully up to the estimate. There were
no withdrawals from store. Liverpool cables were
quiet and steady. Export clearances were large
at 381,421 bushels. The rally In wheat later as
sisted corn, but the full loss was not recovered.
May corn opened at 29%@295/fec, sold between
295 B*-' and 295/ c, closing at 293/ 8 @29%c bid, 14c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts tor to-mor
row. 500 cars.
OATSâ Receded under the influence of the
weakness which ruled in wheat and corn. Very
little business was transacted. Receipts were 238
cars. There were no withdrawals from store. May
closed Vi e lower. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 262 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 90i/4c; May, 2 c:

PROVISIONSâ There i was continued liquida
tion and quite a little raiding in provisions to-day.
A prominent professional was supposed to be the
principal animus of the short selling, and his
prestige wa< important enough to Influence other
traders of lessor importance. Prices declined at
the start, but when the pressure of offerings be
came lighter they regained the lost ground. May
pork closed -'Vie higher, May lard a shade higher
and May ribs unchanged.

DUX'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 20.â R. G. Dun A
Co. will say to-morrow in their weekly review of
trade: Failures for two weeks of March cover liabil
ities of $6,799,397, against $7,372,471 last year.
Failures for the week were 261 in the United
States, against 278 last year, and 49 in Canada,
against 35 la.st year. '
Movement toward better things is still the ex
cept :On. There is belter business in shoes aDd
small industries, and there has been a squeezing
of short sellers in cotton, but the general tendency
of industries and prices Is not . encouraging, and
those who were mod hopeful a month ago are
still waiting, not so hopefully, for the expected re
covery. . .'...'â . . .
Obstructions to recovery are not to be sought
either in the Investment or the money market,
but in the industrial reaction, after the unnatural
! expansion of demand and pries last year. It is a
striking fact lhatthe only great In try which is
now rapidly gaining in business is the one in which
prices have been generally cut down to last year's
lowest figures. The boot and shoe makers , had a
reason for hesitation In the prices of leather, which
still average . 6 per cent higher than a year ago,
though hides are 18 per cent lower, having again
declined the past .week abou. 3 per cent.
If the manufacturers get narrow profits of none
they are at least doing a business which will â¢. keep
! most of the works in operation. The woolen-mills
have different conditions, and with prices already
reduced below last year's lowest average and wool
5.3 per cent higher than it was then they are i not
getting business to keep the works in operation.
Sales of wool were the smallest in any week for
years. â  â  â ' â â¢ -. 'â  -..'â -â â "â â â â 
a sharp decline in the price of cotton goods Is
the comment of the mills on. rising cotton. Goods
now average lower than since May, 1895, having
declined 4.2 percent for the week. ; Â
. The iron industry shows but a slight average de
cline in prices, as , combinations still insist upon
the highest prices of last year, and the demand is
naturally curtailed. Quotations are deceptive be
cause lower prices are constantly made to secure
bus ness. Minor metals change little, but alumi
num quoted erroneously last week sells at 50 cents.
- peculation in co:ton hi s caught short sellers in
trouble, and just because they thought prices must
go lower, the shorts are forced to put them up. :â¢ f v
The market in - wheat has been ' weak though
rather stagnant, but the weight of facts is felt, as
Western receipts for three ; weeks of March have
been 8.982,481 bushels, against 5,624,929 last year.
Atlantic exports, flour included, also snow a de
creasv amounting to 4,084,064 bushels for three
weeks, against 5.097,090 last year. The movement
of corn continues very - large and prices â â¢ have
declined lc for cash. A troublesome feature of the
situation is the stringency in commercial loans,
not because of scarcity of ' money, but â¢ because
banks are disturbed by failures of some import
ance. , ,

Â COALâ Harrison's : Circular says: '-During: â¢ the
week there have been eight arrivals from the Coast
collieries with 15.390 tons of Coal ; from Cardiff
2277 tons, Swansea 3093 tons and Australia 5164
tons. Business in this line still remains quiet, es
pecially in all grades which are principally used for
house purposes. The large -consumers of steam
and gas Coals are utilizing their usual quota, an the
weather cuts but a small | figure with their require
ments. There is little or no change of prices, as
with the exception of a scarcity of some Australian
grades there is a full stock of all others: 111 fact,
the yards show a large accumulation of Welling
ton and Swansea : Anthracite. : The quantity of
English and Australian to arrive within the next
thirty, days will be < considerably â¢ less . than â  the
amount which will be consumed within that time,
hence our stocks must become materially dimin
ished. The total amount of Swansea Coal listed
to be loaded and already afloat Is about 30,000
tons, being the total which will arrive here in the
next six months: whereas fully. 60;.' more will be
required. The amount listed from Sydney and New

Mr. Reed's Politeness.
General credence is not give to the story
of the remark attributed to George Wash
ington that he ''would not be outdone in
politeness by a negro." Nevertheless, says
the Baltimore Sun, it is a story that goes,
and it evidently has- been taken to heart
by Thomas Reed.
One day last week Mr. Reed was saunter
ing along a fashionable uptown street dur
injr calling hours while ladies were alight
ing in droves from their carriages. Two
colored brothers, decidedly the worse look
ing for wear, and belonging to the faction
which, by casting from ten to twenty-live
votes apiece, recently secured the election
of a Reed delegate from this district to the
National Republican Convention, were
hanging around watching the scene. As
Mr. Reed was passing they tugged at the
battered remnants of hats surmounting
their pates and said: "How do, Mr.
Speaker."
Instantly the hand of the Speaker was
elevated, his hat was removed clean from
his head, his body was bent forward in a
bow deep and profound, and the habitual
cynical smile which plays around his lips
melted into one of extreme cordiality as
he replied: "Good morninsr, gentlemen."
An estate that was worth $20,000 when it
got into the law courts twenty-five years
ago was settled last week in Los Angeles,
Cal. The estate was left by Encarnacion
Buelna, in 1870. There wa9 nobody to
claim the 42 cents that remained when the
Public Administrator offered it in the
Superior Court last week, and the Judge
made an order directing that it be paid
into the county treasury.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 20. f
WHEREAS, The Secretary of War has
good reason to believe that the bridges
over Oakland harbor at Alice and
"W ebster streets are unreasonable ob
structions to the free navigation of said
Oakland harbor on account of the in
sufficiency of their draw openings, de
lays in their operation and their
proximity to each other.
It is proposed to require the follow
ing changes to be made in said bridges
by the Ist day of July, 1897, to wit:
1. The reconstruction of the draw spans
so as to give a clear draw opening of
not less than 150 feet.
2. The substitution of other than hand
power for operating the draws.
Propositions looking to the substitu
tion of a single bridge in place of the
two present structures will also be en
tertained.
In order to give you an opportunity
to be heard, as required by the act of
Congress, approved September 19, 1890,
you are hereby notified that a hearing
will be hold before Colonel Charles R.
Sutter at 533 Kearny street, room 15,
in San Francisco, Cal., at 11 o'clock
A. M., on the 25th dky of March, 1896,
when and where you will be given an
opportunity to be heard in the matter.
As all papers will be laid before the
Secretary of War for his decision, it will
perhaps best suit your purposes to sub
mit in writing whatever you wish to
present.
By authority of the Secretary of War,
CHARLES B. SUTTKR,
Colonel of Engineers, U. S. A.
The United States Government has de
cided that the shaky old drawbridges
across the estuary are reasonable ob
structions to navigation and insufficient
foe the traffic of the harbor.
This morning Mayor Davie received a
communication from Colonel Charles R.
Sutter. colonel of engineers, U. S. A., ask
ing him to be present and present his
proofs of the lack of accommodation on
account of the present drawbridges.
The action to be taken by the United
States Government is the tirst indication
since the bridges were originally built that
the commerce of the harbor is to receive
equal recognition with the desires of the
Southern I'acific Company. For years the
Â»wo bridges have been the curse of naviga
tion in Oakland harbor, and the demands
of tugboats and ships have been either
totally disregarded or obeyed at leisure by
the bridge-tenders, who, being responsible
only to the Supervisors for their position?,
felt no fear of becoming acquainted with
the ax so long as they did all that the rail
road renuired.
Now this is to cease, and with the ex
pected confirmation by the Supreme Court
of the decision of Judge Ogden regarding
the water front, the announcement that
the War Department has taken the mat
ter of the bridges in hand, the future of the
harbor has become the most important
topic before the people of Oakland and
Alameda.
"This statement from Colonel Sutter is
an indication that the hand of the South
ern Pacific Company is to be felt no longer
in the United States engineer's office, "
said Mayor Davie to-nieht. "It is the re
sult of negotiations carried on mostly by
myself, and I cannot help feeling grat
ified at the result. It also shows how the
tactics of the Southern Pacific Company
would have prevailed, as far as the present
Board of Work 9is concerned. Last spring
I obtained the passage by the Ci.ty Council
of a resolution authorizing the Board of
Works to inspect the drawbridges.
"The following morning Mr. Wilder
came to me and said that he would like the
company's engineer to accompany us when
we made the inspection. I consented and
then Mr. Wilder said their engineer was
somewheiÂ»e in another State and could we
wait till he returned.
"I replied that I could not do so and tlie
same nipht the Board of Works passed a
resolution ordering us to inspect the
bridges.
"So far as Commissioners Wilson and
Feirsol are concerned, they are still wait
ing for Mr. Wilder's engineer.
"On the following mornine, however, I
took a photographer, and it extreme low
tide we made several pictures of the bridges.
They were absolutely falling to pieces. I
forwarded tlie pictures to Washington, ac
companied by a prote-t signed by the
Spreckels Tugboat Company; Goodall,
Perkins & Co., TheDavie Ferry and Trans
portation Company, Captain Hackett, Cot
ton Bros, and all the owners of tugs and
sailing vessels that had lost thousands of
dollars through the delay caused on open
ing the bridges whenever the railroad com
pany's interest was best served in keeping
them closed.
"Then the clever hand of the railroad
was seen. Two days after I photographed
tlie bridges the Southern Pacific com
menced to repair tliem, and they drove
piles till they bad practically made new
structures. They spent $15,000 in repair
ing the bridges and then they reported to
the authorities what they had done. But,
unfortunately for them, my photographs
had preceded them. Now, if I had waited
for Mr. Wilder's engineer, my report could
not have been made an 1 tlie present action
might have been delayed for years. 1 pre
sume it was for that that the City En
gineer and City Attorney have waited.
"Colonel Mendel was retired at the right
tune for the public good, and the people
are now to reap the benerit of the change, j
I was requested by the War Department
to report to the local engineer's office a3 I
had done to Washington, and I did so.
My plans are there, and 1 have no doubt
that they will be ultimately adopted.
There is no need for two bridges. One
modern steel structure, with spans of the
width ordered on all Government business,
can be made to accommodate more trains,
teams and streetcars than half a dozen
such wooden bridges as the two wrecks
that are now obstructing the estuary.
"As near as I can locate the proper
place for an ample bridge with all modern
appliances would be about a thousand feet
east of the Alice-street draw. This would
bring it about at the foot of Oak street.
This is the natural place for it as well as
the most beneficial. At that point the
estuary is narrowest, and vessels which
sail down the harbor could have the ad
vantage of making long tacks on either
side and of shooting through the bridge at
t!je most favorable point. From Oak
street across to Alamedathereisa streak of
hardpan across the estuary and this would
enable a bridge to be constructed at about
half the cost of building at the location of
the present bridges, where hardpan is
about twenty feet further down. Then,
again, at the point I mention a bridge
would almost connect the centers of both
Oakland and Alameda.
''Another advantage is that the distance
from the end of Oak street to what would
be the first pier of the bridce is about 1200
feet. To make an incline of thirty feet in
this distance would not be felt by teams or
passengers and would enable them to cross
on the upper roadway, leaving the lower
track exclusively for teams ana electric
cars.
"Of course this plan will not be favor
able to the railroad company, because it
will cause them some expense. The only
change in their route will be that they
will have to lay three blocks of track on
either side of the estuary to make the
crossing at Oak street. The expense will
not be very heavy for the bridge, as the
county, the Southern .Pacific and the elec
tric-road company will all have to shoul
der the burden.
"This matt-*- is one of supreme im
portance and these views are what I have
already expressed to Washington and
what i have been requested to present to
Colonel Sutter. From what I know I be
lieve the War Department has already
decided on its course and the usual by
play of the railroad will not avail this
time."
Some time ago the Supervisors asked- for
and received an opinion from Chief Deputy
District Attorney Church with regard to
their jurisdiction over the wagon and rail
bridge over the estuary at Webster street.
The request was made because at the time
the question was raised that the structure
in question was an obstruction to naviga
tion and that both it and the Alice-street
bridge should be supplanted by one large
modern structure with a draw wide
enough to accommodate the largest sea
going vessels.
Mr. Church made an elaborate report, in
which he held that nobody, not even the
Secretary of War of the United States, has
any authority over the Webster-street
bridge save the Supervisors of Alameda,
unless an act of Congress should be passed
on the subject specifically referring to the
bridge in question and the estuary of San
Antonio, and no such act, he claimed, had
ever been passed. This opinion was for
warded to the representative of the Secre
tary of War on the coast, namely, Colonel
Charles R. Sutter, colonel of engineers, U.
S. A., who has succeeded Colonel Mendell
and whose office is at San Francisco.
The document, it is presumed, was duly
forwarded to Secretary of War Lamont,
and nothing was heard of the matter
until this morning, when the summons
were received by the Mayor and the
County Clerk as representatives of the
Supervisors. It is evident that the Secre
tary of War differs radically with the
reasoning and facts contained in the Dis
trict Attorney's opinion, because the prin

Sutter refers to, had been declared uncon

PENSIONS FOR TEACHERS
The Present Act Regarded by
Alameda Educators as a
Failure.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 20.â 1t would
seem that unless the pchoolteachers of the
county secure an amendment to the "Pub
lic School Teachers' Annuity and Retire
ment Fund" act, which was approved on
March 26, 1895, and which has been in
force now almost one year, it would be
come a dead letter. It is rather opaque
and incomprehensible an instrument at
best and the teachers have found it to be
inoperative in practice and merely a con
glomeration of meaningless words. In
Alameda the effort to have it go into effect
has met with flat failure, and only when
an amendment to it is made will -the
teachers attempt to make use of its in
tended benefits.
Tne act provides for the organization of
a board of commissioners, composed of
the County Superintendent of Schools, the
chairman of the Board of Supervisors and
tbe County Treasnrer, with power to re
ceive and distribute funds. For teachers
who have served for twenty years the act
provides for a pension of $45 per month,
and for those vb* have served twenty-five
years $50 per month.
The pensioner must also have joined
the annuity fund. A singular feature
about the act is tljat it will not go into
effect until twenty years after its passage,
which makes it of no special value to any
one. It is only operative at present when
r subscriber to the fund pays down $300,
and even tnen there is a question, because
ii. t a sufficient number of persons could
procure that sum.
The particularly meaningless part of the
act is to be found in the wording of section
9. It is as iollows:
To provide a fund for the payments pro
vided lor in this act the secretary of the Board
ol Education in ench municipality shall cer
tify monthly to the treasurer of each munici
pality and -the Board of Trustees In every
school district outside of such municipalities
shall certify and pay over in like manner to
ths County Treasurer of each county 1 per
cent of the amount due each teacher a's salary
for the previous month.
The section as it reads means that the
secretary of the Board of Education shall
certify something not stated, and the
trustees in outside districts shall certify
something unknown. It is perfectly
meaningless.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1896.
GIFT TO THE ALTENHEIM
Mrs. Isaac Hecht Formally Pre
sents the Legacy of Her
Husband.
GRIEVANCE OF THE DIRECTORS
A Complaint That the Authorities
Ignore the Very Modest Wants
of the Institution.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 20. \
Mrs. Isaac Hecht appeared before the
board of directors of the Altenheim at its
regular meeting and ratified formally the
gift of $1000 by her lately deceased hus
band, the San Francisco merchant. She
was accorded a hearty vote of thanks by
the directors.
Mrs. Hecht also presented the home
with a fine portrait of her husband, which
will be placed in the gallery along with
those of the other patrons of the institu
tion.
Mrs. "W. Westhoff, the visiting member
of the board of managers for this week,
makes a very encouraging report regard
ing the attendance, saying:
"We have enough means fn sight to
provide comfortably for our dependents
here, though such an institution as this,
with constantly increasing demands upon
it, has never more than enough in the way
of funds. Our society suffered somewhat
in the way of loss of contributory mem
bership because it was decided to locate
the institution here instead of San Fran
cisco. The membership now'is somewhat
increasing. Some of the dissatisfied ones
are coming back to us when they see the
magnificent results that we have been able
to accomplish because of our fine location
here.
"We do not wish to seem to complain
unnecessarily in any direction, but we
j sometimes feel hurt "at the city authori
: ties from the fact that while we are
J an Oakland institution, and buy all our
I supplies in Oakland, we cannot secure
sufficient recognition to get an electric
I. light put up in front of the Altenheirn,
though it is located on the main thorough
fare, and though private citizens within a
biock or two can get electric lights erected
|in front of their residences. We have
| repaired and graded the streets around us
and done other work, but we cannot sup
ply an electric light. Many of our direc-
I tors' meetings are held at night, and the
members are obliged to ko stumbling
through the darkness to the streetcar. We
hope we shall soon be accommodated."
CHARGES OF SLANDER.
Allegations of Rrueger's Complaint
Against Theodore Gier.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 20.â A. Krue
ger, the private detective employed by
License Inspector Mitchell in securing
evidence to enable" him to enforce the
! liquor laws and ordinances concerning the
! conduct of the liquor traffic in the city of
j Oakland and the conviction of these same
! laws, has filed his complaint against Theo-
I dore Gier, the well-known Washington
| street liquor-dealer, for $7500 damages for
j slander.
Io bis complaint Krueger says he has
always maintained a good reputation
among his neighbors, and that on March
10, in the presence of L. A. Mitchell and
others, Gier said, addressing the former:
; â¢'Some time ago you hired a man named
i Krueger to assist you in your work. 1
| would request that you refrain from hiring
i him as he is untrue to you. I know of
| cases he offered to square after he had
I caugnt the parties selling liquor,"
Another allegation is that on March ll
Gier said of plaintift:
"At the time that the liquor-dealers on
Twenty-third avenue were applying for li
censes I was helping them as best I could
for purely business reasons. Krueger came
to me on several occasions, and, knowing
that I was in touch with the applicants,
intimated very broadly that wliile he held
conclusive evidence against many of them,
he did not care to push matters and make
trouble, and was willing to make any com
promise that could be agreed upon. I
went to several dealers and suggested the
same settlement. At that time the dealers
had not been granted any licenses, and
of course the sale of liquors by them would
have been illegal. This Krueger pretended
to watch, wit., the results as stated. I now
declare that he was open to bribes or any
thing else there was money in." * * *
The third allegation is that on March
13 Gier said :
"It is a fact that he tried to settle caseÃ.
He went out to Twenty-third avenue
among some of the men out there and
made the offer and they sent him to me.
He came to me, not once, but several
times within two weeks, to my place of
business and talked settlement."
The statements were published by a
paper in this city as interviews, and
Krueger demands $2500 damages for each,
or a total of $7500.

HIS HELMET IN DANGER
Steward Galvin of the Fire
Department Followed His
Doctor's Advice.
Mayor Davie Pities Him Because His
Father Does Not Own a
Populist Paper.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 20. (
The Fire Commissioners held a brief
session this morr.ing. Mayor Davie and
the other two who always vote as one
could not agree, as usual, and Steward
Galvin of the Fire Department, whose al
leged misconduct was nnder investigation,
is now on the anxious seat.
bteward Galvin was charged with carry
ing liquor into the engine-house. He pro
duced a certificate from Dr. Blood stating
that he was very subject to congestion of
the lungs and advising him to take a
stimulant whenever he returned from a
fire at which he got wet. Councilman
Brosnahan appeared as counsel for the
steward and told a little political story of
how a plot had been on foot for six months
to get Galvin out of the department.
Bert Swan, foreman of Galvin s com
pany, was the chief witness against him.
Brosnahan wanted to know if the witness
did not say he was going to file charges
against Ualvinâ that Galvin was fighting
the witness, and was trying to get Bob
Grant in as foreman of the company. The
witness could not remember this at first,
but finally admitted that Driver Charles
Scribner had told him that Galvin was try
ing to "do him up." He also admitted
that Brosnahan had told him that Scribner
was a cunning politician and that he had
beiÂ»n "up to the same thing before."
Councilman Brosnahan made a speech,
stating that he thought the case was a
very tame one. He thought it was merely
an attempt to get Galvin out of the de
partment. If lie had to go, Brosnahan
said he had cone poliiics long enough to
know it would do no good to talK.
Then Brosnahan drew a comparison of
the varying degrees of principle shown by
the Commissioners. He referred to the
cas-6 of young Bretz, and said : "It is very
strange that one man can go off on a spree,
neglect his work for a week and acknowl
edge that he pot married while drunk,
and still hold his job, whil*s another man,
who took a glass of whisky under orders
from his physician, should oe in danger of
being discharged."
Mayor Davie remarked that Galvin's
father does not run a Populist newspaper.
This was a direct reference to ex-Assem
blyman Bretz, who until a few days ago
was proprietor of Industry. After hearing
the evidence the matter was taken under
advisement.
"This is another of those despicably
small matters that show how utterly unlit,
some men are to be judges in sucn mat
ters," ?aid Mayor Davie to-night. "Wil
son and Peirsol appo.nted their man Fair
to be Chief, and now he is doing
their work. Their protection of Bretz ana
their evident disposition to be hard on
Galvin is the best that can be expected of
them. They were born prejudiced."
Vallejo vs. Haywardo.
HAYWARDS, Cal., March 20.- Much
interest has been aroused here over a came
of football to be played here Sunday be
tween the eleven from Vallejo ana the
local team. The grounds and men are in
pood condition, and the indications are
that it will be a hotly contested game from
start to linish. The local team has met
and defeated a number of good elevens,
and hope to be the victors this time.
PRIMARIES OR A REVOLT
The Question That Faces the
Third Congressional Dis
trict Committee.
WILL BE DECIDED TO-DAY.
The Alameda Delegates' Resolution
Dispensing With Primaries to
Be Dealt With.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 20. |
There Is only one thing that will prevent
the Republican party of this county from
severing all connections with the present
leaders and reorganizing for themselves,
independent of the present' Congressional
and county committeemen. The remedy
is in the hands of the Third District Con
gressional Committee, which meets in San
Francisco to-morrow. Should the com
mittee accept the recommendation of the
Alameda County delegation aad order
them to appoint the delegates a movement
for reorganization will be at once started,
and the result will be a complete division
of the party. Should the recommendation
be ignored and primaries be ordered there
would still be a dissatisfied faction, but
they would be a minority.
Although the original dissension was
caused by the announcement that George
C. Pardee would attempt to go to St. Louis
instead of Senator Denison, who has got
into the habit of going to National con
ventions, it has broadened into a fight be
tween the present leaders of the party and
the reform element. As regards Pardee
and Denison the party is about equally di
vided, but in regard to the fight over pri
maries a large majority is in favor of
them. Many of Denison's supporters are
opposed to the appointment of delegates
by six committeernen and all of Pardoe's
are in favor of primaries, so that should
the Congressional committee order pri
maries it vcill undoubtedly be satisfactory
to a majority of the Republican electors.
The language of Rev. Dr. Coyle and W.
R. Davis regarding the exercise of one
man power has produced a marked effect,
but it is not so much the nominating of a
St. Louis delegate that is now interesting
the electors as the words at the end of the
call for the district convention. The call
concludes, "and for such other business as
may be brought before the convention."
This language, it is said, has been intro
duced for the purpose of making it pos
sible for the convention to nominate a can
didate for Congress. This supposition cer
tainly does not apply to Messrs. Morrow
and Tayior, who voted with Senator P^arl
for primaries for three weeks until they
saw the deadlock could not be broken, and
who only changed in order that some
agreement micht be reached.
It now appears that much of the opposi
tion to the action of the Alameda delega
tion last Saturday night arose from the
idea that its action was final. This, of
course, is not the case, although the cora
mitteemen were given to understand that
after taking the feeling of their constitu
encies their recommendation would be
ratified. If the presidents and secretaries
of ward clubs who have been invited to
attend to-morrow s meeting present the
resolutions passed by their respective clubs,
it is considered as certain that tl>e Con
gressional District Committee will attempt
to heal the breach ana order primaries for
Alameda County.
THE MILLINER IS FREE.
A Warrant for Forgery Issued That
Wag Defective in Fact and
Technicality.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, March 20. }
Mrs. Dushane considers herself a very
much abused woman. Yesterday a man
named Foster called on her and presented
a promissory note against Mr. Dushane.
Her husband not being at home, the col
lector demanded payment, and according
to Mrs. Dushane behaved iike a hoodlum.
She told foster her husband was a traveler
and was on the road, but he was very per
sistent and finally left.
Later in the day Mrs. Dushane was ar
rested on a wanant issued by R. R. Moore
Jr., a depnty in the District Attorney's
ortice, charging her with forgery. When
the milliner was in jail it was recognized
that some one had blundered. Mr. Moore
did not want the woman held on the
forgery charge and suggested that Chief
Lloyd release her. This he had no power
to do, but later Judge Wood released her
or. her own recognizance.
When the case was called in the Police
Court this morning Mrs. Dushane was re
leased, as the complaint was defective.
Foster says that, the milliner tore up the
note and Mrs. Dushane denies destroying
it, and there were no other witnesses.

A MOTHER IS AVENGED.
C. A. Bailey Convicted of Selling
Opium Without a Doc
tor's License.
DHAMATIC SCENE IN COURT.
Mrs. Sarah McConnell Invokes the
Blessing of God Upon Judge
and Jury.
Cbarles A. Bailey, druggist, Grant
avenue and Sutter street, appeared before
a jury in Judge Campbell's court yes
terday afternoon to answer to the charge
of selling morphine without a doctor's
prescription.
A great deal of interest was manifested
in the case and the courtroom was
crowded. The complaining witness was
Mrs. Sarah McConnell of 400 Harrison
Ftreet. A week ago Mrs. McConnell's son,
John W, Hall, an opium "fiend," was at
her request sentenced by Judge Campbell
to six months in the County Jail for
vagrancy, in the hope that it would have
the effect of curing him of the habit.
The Judge told her that if she knew the
persons who sold the drug to her son
without a doctor's prescription and could
get them to do the same thing for her" or
anybody else he would inflict the severest
penalty upon them if convicted.
Mrs. McConnell and a friend. Mrs. T>. H.
Parker, went straight from the courtroom
to Bailey's drngstore and bought 10 cents'
worth of morphine. They also went to
Carroll's drugstore on Stockton and Market
streets and purchased a similar quantity
from Otto Jackson, one of the clerks.
They immediately returned to the court
room with the packages and Mrs. Mc-
Connell swore out warrants for the arrest
of Bailey and Jackson.
Bailey demanded a jury trial and the
case came on yesterday afternoon. There
â were sn many peremptory challenges on
both sides that the venire of tnirty was ex
hausted and only nine had been passed.
A special venire of ten was brought in and
the other three were quickly secured. At
torney Lennon appeared for the defendant
ar.d Prosecuting Attorney Forbes was as
sisted by Assistant Prosecuting Attorney
Graham of Judge Joachimsen's court.
The young man, Hall, had been brought
from the Branch County Jail and his
emaciated appearance excited the pity of
all who saw him. He looked as if he could
not live many days. There were affecting
scenes between him and his mother. He
seemed as helpless as a chiid.
Mrs. McConnell testiried to going straight
from the courtroom on March 13 to Bailey's
drugstore and purchasing from Bailey 10
cents' worth of morphine. She had not a
doctor's prescription or order, nor was she
ssked for one. She was corroborated by
Mrs. Parkef, who said that Bailey had
offered her a pill to cure her of the mor
phine habit.
Hall was Called to the stand, but his
evidence was objected to by the defense,
and the action was sustained. In answer
to the Judge he said he was addicted to
the morphine habit.
Dr. Frank Fitzgibbons, Assistant Police
Surgeon at the Receiving .Hospital, was
shown the package purchased by Mrs. Mc-
Conneil, and said it contained two or three
grains of morphine.
For the defense Bailey caused a genuine
sensation in court by testifying that Mrs.
McConnnell had presented an order from
a doctor. He denied sellinc the morphine,
but when cross-examined by Graham he
fraid he remembered selling the morphine
to Mrs. McConnell, but she had handed
an order from a doctor, and ne had brought
his prescnption-booK with him to bear out
his statement.
Mrs. McConnell became so excited that
at the suggestion of the Judge she retired
from the courtroom.
Bailey said Mrs. McConnell had asked
for morphine for her son and handed him
the order, which was folded in about four
folds. He took it behind the prescription
counter and filled it.
The prescription-book wasproduced, and
pasted in it under date of March 13 was an
order, written in a bold masculine hand,
for ten grains of morphine, sicned "Mor
rison, M.D.," and on the corner was writ
ten "For J. W. Hall."
A niaÂ«nifving-giass was sent for and
Judse and jury carefully scanned the
order to see it there was any mart of any
fol<is in it, but none could De seen.
Bailey could not say who "Morrison,
JM.D." was. He said the order was pasted
in the prescription-book on the morning of
Hatch 14 by his son.
C. A. Bailey Jr. corroborated his father.
He said in cross-examination that he had
taken the order off a wire and had pasted
it in the book. As there was no mark of a
wire on the order, he said in answer to
Attorney Lennon that it was customary to
trim ihe prescriptions to make them fit
into a certirin space. He did not know Dr.
Morrison.
After argument of counsel the Judge
summed up briefly and the jury reti;ed,
taking tie prescription-book and magnify
gla^s with them. This was about 5:30
o'clock. Shortly after ti o'clock they tiled
into the courtroom and the foreman stated
that they wished to ask the defendant two
or three questions. Attorney Lennon ob
jected, as the case had been submitted,
and they filed back asrain to their room.
Ten minutes later they sent word they
could riot apree and the Judge ordered
them back tiil 8 o'clock.
Tne Judge did not leave the courtroom
and in a few minutes the jury intimated
tliev had agreed upon a verdict. They
to k their seats, and on being asked the
nature of their verdict, the foreman
answered "Guilty, as cnarged."
Then followed" a dramatic scene. Mrs.
McConnell had been sittine beside her son
with his arms around her neck. The tears
were coming down her clierks and he was
trying to console her. As soon as the fore
man s:iid "guilty, as charged." she rushed
toward the jury-box and falling on her
knees before them and clasping her hands
she raised them above her head and in
voked the blessing of God upon them and
the Judge. She was gently led away by
her iarly friends as the Judge rapped for
orler. There were many wet eye 3in the
courtroom as she quietly walked away
weeping with bowed head.
Tlifi Jndfre continued the case till to-day
for sentence, and Attorney Lennon inti
mated that he would appeal to the Supe
rior Court.
What action will be faketi by the Judge
in regard to the order signed by Morrison,
M.D.. remain.s to be seen.
The attention of the proper authorities
will aJ?o be called to the fact that Hall,
although sent to the Branch County Jail
to cure him of the opium habit, can get as
nmcii of the drug as he likes there. At
least he said so in court yesterday. There
is what is called the "iit-nds' row," and
visitors ke*p tnem fuily supplied with the
drug.

CORES EFFECTED
BY SUGGESTION
Dr. A. A. d'Ancona Tells of
His Experiences With
Hypnotism.
SOME STRIKING CASES.
One Young Lady Believed of a
Nervous Affection After
but One Seance.
ALL PERSONS SUSCEPTIBLE.
The Method of Inducing the Hypnotic
State Varies With Each
Subject.
Hypnotism as a therapeutic agent in the
practice of medicine has apparently taken
a wider and firmer hold on the profession
of San Francisco than the layman has had
any conception of, and its use, according
to those who have utilized the mysterious
power, has been most wonderful and satis
factory in its results. Among the enthusi
asts on the subject is Dr. A. A. d'Ancona,
a member of the faculty of the State Uni
versity.
He has been using this agency for seve
ral years, and recently depends upon it to
a very large extent for his results. De
spite the fact that bis large practice has
given hi in the opportunity of demonstrat
ing the emcacy of hypnotism on many
patients, who are but too willing to sound
his praise, the doctor is extremely
averse to Having the matter discussed
in connection with him personally, and it
was with most extreme reluctance that he
consented to talk of tne matter yesterday,
though he freely admitted that he was a
thorough enthusiast on the subject and
had used it with great success in many
cases, some of a most striking character.
On being asked if it were possible to ex
ercise the hypnotic power on all persons
with success, that is, so as to make them
amenable to suggestion by the operator,
he replied:
"Various operators in reporting the
number of cases in which they have suc
ceeded in' inducing hypnosis cive different
percentage?. In some tin* percentage is as
low as Q, while in others it is as high as 80.
"In a book published in lS4ti, written by
an English surgeon practicing in India, a
record of so-calied mesmeric work shows
that those who are not susceptible to the
influence are very few. This doctor's
practice was confined to the natives.
"The susceptibility to hypnosis varies in
different people, but exists in all. In other
words, to be a hypnotic subject does not
require the possession of any special phy
sical or mental characteristics.
"The hypnosis may vary from a light
somnolent state to profound stupor. If a
person retires to rest at night and persists
in thinking of the events of the day he
certainly will never fall asleep unless the
need of sleep is great. fc>o if a person
resists the efforts of the hypnotic operator
by active thought upon any subject he
will not go into the hypnotic sleep unless
he is by nature specially susceptible.
"To become hypnotic readily does not
indicate weakness of will any more than
does going to sleep as soon as the head
touches the pillow."
"How is the hypnotic sleep induced?"
was asked.
"I might answer," replied the doctor,
who was now thoroughly interested in his
attempt to elucidate his subject, "that all
roads lead to Rome. But there are two
general theories or explanations. One is
that hypnotism is induced by sug
gestion, and the other by the physi
cal effects of the manipulations of the
operator. The method of producing it
varies with the patient. I really cannot tell
myself how I operate after I get started,
but the use of passes is not at all essential.
Sometimes I use them and at others not,
but I never know what I am going to do
after I begin to concentrate my mind on the
patient."
On being requested to give the facts con
cerning what he considered some ol the
most striking case* in his experience, he
related the following, for obvious reasons
omitting names:
'â¢One case was that of a young woman
who had become greatly worried owing to
having seen a good deal of a case of in
sanity in the person of her cousin, who
was a member of her family.
"The night after it became necessary to
remove him to a. sanitarium she awoke at
midnight, declaring she heard a voice say
ing 'festering brain.' At first, she said,
6he smiled to herself at the absurdity of
the words, but as the voice persisted she
became possessed of the idea that she her
self would be ill. All through that night
and the succeeding days the voice con
tinued.
"It was not at this point that I was
called in. When I saw her it was 8 o'clock
in the evening, and she was extremely
hysterical and suffering from a severe
headache.
"The suggestion was given her that her
headache would become rapidly less
severe, that the voice would become
fainter, and that when she retired she
would go right to sleep.
"She reported the next day that she re
tired at 10:30 p. m., that she had no head
ache, that the voice had died away so

completely, that when she tried to re
member the words she found that the only
words in the English language that she
could recall were 'French' and 'fricasse.'
"Her trouble never returned, though
she underwent but this one treatment.
This was on May 10. 1895.
"Some months after this she got the im
pression that the ceiling, the chandelier or
whatever was over her head was about to
fall on her, and this hallucination was dis
sipated by the same manner of treatment.
"Another case was that of a woman who
was thoroughly ran down from nursing
her mother through a ionc illness. She
had frequent attacks during the day and
night, in the course of which she felt what
physicians call the sense of impending
death.
"She would wake up from a sound sleep
owing to the vividness of the impression
that she was about to die. That impres
sion disappeared rapidly after two or three
sittings, but it took several weeks to bring
her to a reasonably good nervous state."
A BANQUET FOR CHAUNCEY.
The Union League flub Wires an Invi-
tatlon to the Great Orator.
The news published in yesterday's Call
that Chauncey M. Depew was coming to
San Francisco created great joy among the
banqueters.
Colonel George Stone, president of the
Union League Club, called a special meet
ing of the directors of that institution yes
terday and it was resolved to tender
THE LATE DR. O. H. PETTERSON.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
to the famous orator a great banquet at
the Palace Hotel, to which a host of repre
sentative Californians will be invited.
The invitation was promptly wired to
Mr. Denew in New York and his accept
ance is hourly expected.
Mr. Depew enjoys great renown as the
orator who has banibhed the chestnut from
the banquet board.
In a brochure entitled "Our Chauncey"
Isaac H. Bromley fancies Jove on high
Olympus getting weary of threadbare
jokes in dinner speeches. The Jovian re
frain runs:
These dinner speeches tire me.
They are tertious. flat and stale.
From a thousand banquet tables
Comes a melancholy wail.
As a hundred thousand banqueters
Sit up in evening dress
And salute each mouldy chestnut
With a signal of distress.
Thereupon Jove rallies all the gods and
organizes an expedition to discover an ora
tor. In his cradle Chauncey was found.
Mercury itnew him in a minute by the
"looseness of his chin."
"This Attic salt." said Father Jove,
â¢' \\ ill keep h-.m extra dry.'"
At which the boy looked'up
And dropped the corner of his eye.
Chaunceys' career from the cradle to
Yale is pictured in verse. His achieve
ments at the banquet board are thus recog
nized:
He's been dining and speaking
For years near a score;
He bas routed th<- chestnut,
Kvicted the boor.
No table's without him.
No (I nner complete,
The fun always wafts
Till he gets on his feet:
Making ail men his friends
Without seeming to try.
Now he prays with the pious,
Now drinks with the dry,
Always sweet as a daisy
And fresh as the dew,
No fly ever lighted
On Chauncey Depew.
WAR INCIDENT OF THE PUTTJEE.
The Great General Wan Gloomy Because
Things Were Not Going Ahead.
The great general was perturbed.
"We must do something to gain time,"
he said. "I cannot risk a battle now."
'"But the enemy is advancing already,"
protested his aid.
â¢'Then we must fall back," returned the
general decisively.
"We are strongly intrenched," sug
gested the aid.
"I cannot help It," replied the general,
"The odds are against us, and it would be
nothing less than suicidal to risk an en
gagement."
â¢'We outnumber them," persisted the
aid. as if unable to understand the gen
eral's sudden resolve.
"In the matter of mere numbers we have
the advantage, but â "
The general shook his head solemnly.
" "The fact is," he continued a mouient
later, "a great calamity has overtaken us."
"The ammunition â "
"Oh, that's all right."
"Our supply-trains have not been cut
off, have they?"
"Has any one tampered with the bal
loons?'
"No."
"Tlie batteriesâ"
"They're in good condition, but we have
no one who can keep them in good repair
and operate them as they should be
opera tea."
The aid grew pale.
"The electrician â " he gasped.
"The electrician is dead drunk," replied
the general. "We will have to fall back
and wait until he is lit for duty again. We
cannot risk an engagement without him."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 21, 1896.
PIONEER PHYSICIAN DEAD
Dr. 0. H. Petterson Passes Away
After a Lingering
Illness.
CAME HERE IN FORTY-NINE.
Was Once City Physician of Sacra
mentc â Lived for Many Years in
Placer County.
Another California pioneer of forty-nine,
Dr. O- H. Petterson, has passed away. The
deceased had been ill for nearly a year.
He died at his home at 1009 Clay street on
Thursday. The funeral will be under the
auspices of Crockett Lodge No. 139, F. and
A. M., and will take place at 1:30 o'clock
to-day.
Dr. Petterson was born in New York in
1830 and was graduated from the College
of Physicians and Surgeons of that city.
He also took a post-graduate course at the
State University. He came to California
in the summer of 1840 and located at Sac-
ramento. He had charge of the city hos
pital of Sacramento for over a year. Later
he removed to Salmon Falls, El Dorado
County, where he practiced his profession
and met with considerable success. He was
also a Justice of the Peace and Associate
Justice of the Court of Sessions. During
his residence at this place he enjo}-ed the
confidence and respect of the community.
Dr. Petterson next moved to New Alma
den, where he remained for eighteen
months as surgeon to the company that
was then operating the quicksilver mines
at that place. He returned to San Fran
cisco, but finding that the climate of the
peninsula did not agree- with him he
moved to lowa Hill, Placer County, where
he built up a large and lucrative practice.
He remained in Placer County, where he
was well and favorably known, until seven
years ago, when he came to San Francisco
with his family, and since that time made
his City his permanent home.
The doctor was well known outside of
his profession as well as recognized in
that calling for his honesty, integrity and
skillfuluess in the treatment of diseases.
He leaves a widow and large family of
grown children to mourn his loss.
SYMPHONY CONCERT.
I.,audsberger Wins Applanse for Hla
Violin Solos at Golden Gate
Hall.
A good programme was performed yes
terday afternoon in Golden Gate Hall at
the seventh popular concert of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra. The au
dience was a large one and showed great
appreciation for all the works performed.
The orchestra opened the concert with
the overture to Rossini's "Tancred," the
familiar ninsic being gracefully and effect
ively rendered. This was followed by the
"Largo Appassionato." from Beethoven's
A major sonata, scored for small orchestra
by the conductor, J. H. Howe, and "Love's
Dream After the Ball," Czibulka.
Nathan Landsberger played a "Legend,"
by Wieniawski, ami .a "Spanish Dance,"
by F. Rehfeld, with the orchestra. Both
works were well within the young violin
ist's powers, and he rendersd them with
considerable breadth and impression. The
".Spanish Dance," which was a remarkably
taking composition, was most enthusias
tically encored, and Mr. Landsberger re
sponded by playing "Leonard's "Souvenir
de Bade."
Miss Rose Adler showed that she has
improved considerably in her singing. She
no longer raises her shoulders to any per
ceptible extent in breathing and the emis
sion ot her tones is purer. She sang "The
Maids of Cadiz," by Delibes, very prettily
and as" an encore gave "Oh, Happy Day.
In the excerpt from the garden scene in
"Faust," which Miss Adler sang with
Dr. D. A. Hodghead, the young lady's
voice was scarcely dramatic enough to
sustain the role of Marguerite effectively,
but she sang the "Faust" music gracefully
and pleasantly notwithstanding. Dr.
Hodphead was not an unsatisfactory Faust
and lie sang his aria from the "Lucia"
well, but he might secure a much fuller
tone it he would aim at a less nasal pro
duction.
The final Strauss waltz by the orchestra,
"DorfschwaJben," was played with consid
erable s-pirit, but the temps was slower
than that which Eaouard Strauss gives to
the family waltzes when his orchestra
plays them.
A movement is under way to provide
funds by neans of which the rehearsals of
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
may be continued throughout the summer
in order to prepare for the fall concerts.

CONSUMPTIVES ISOLATED
Successful Operation of the New
Ordinance in Ala
meda.
PATIENTS MUST BE ADVISED.
Methods of Treatment Mast Be Changed
to Prevent the Spread of
Contagion.
Dr. 0. H. Lubbock, Health Officer of
Alameda, in speaking yesterday of the or
dinance recently adopted by the Alameda
Council requiring physicians to report
cases of consumption for the purpose of
isolating the patients said: "It is too soon
to make any statement of the practical re
sults of the new order, but that it will be
very effective in preventing the spread of
the disease there can be no doubt.
"It is now known that consumption is
contagions," said Dr. Lubbock, "and the
wonder is that precautions of this kind
have not been taken all over the land. I
believe it has been left for Alameda to set
the example, as I Know of no other place
where the isolation of consumptives is un
dertaken.
"By isolation we mean room isolation,
of course. We could not undertake to
house up consumptives as we do smallpox
patients. In the first place there is not
the necessity, for the one disease is not
nearly as contagious a 9 the other. What
we do is to require the family to give the
patient a, room by himself, or at least a
oed. We require them to be cleanly, well
supplied with handkerchiefs or cloths for
use on the street, which are afterward
burned.
"A mother having consumption will
often have her. children sleeping in the
same bed with her, and by kissing them
and other similar means communicate the
disease. In such cases it is generally
blamed on hereditary taint, while that is
really not the cause at all. A perfectly
healthy person sleeping in the same bed
with a consumptive for a length of time is
almost certain to become affected with the
disease.
"Hitherto," continued the doctor, "it
has been customary to conceal from a con
sumptive the fact that he is such. The
effort has been to avoid the depressing
effect of the knowledge upon the patient's
mind and spirits. But with the recogni
tion of this disease as contagious other
people must be considered. So that the
time has about come when the old rule
must be abandoned, Lhe patient advised of
his complaint and precautions taken to
prevent its communication to otliers.
"As to the cure of consumption, that is
another matter. I am afraid that the
several cures that have received so much
attention lately have hardly been put to
sufficient test as yet to warrant the pinning
of great faith to them. There has not been
time enough. It is unfortunate that they
have been brought to public notice prema
turely, for the effect is to discredit even
that which may be good. lam not saying
that these remedies are not all that is
claimed for them, but that they have not
been made certain as yet. But whether
they are or not, I am "sure that an ef
fective remedy for consumption in its early
siages is only a matter of a little time. The
inquiry and experiment that is going on
will surely rind it.
"In the meantime it is plainly within
the province of common-sense to remove
those causes lor the spread of the disease
that all physicians are aware of."
Artolph WÂ«Â»kc'Â» Failure.
Adolph Weske, the litigious Sonoma County
farmer, has failed for $17,250. His property
1b valued at $15,150, but it is heavily mort
gaged. Weske was a wealthy man a few years
ago, but domestic troubles brought -him to
law and he spent money very rapidly. Some
time ago he was before court on an order to
Rhow cause why he would not pay alimony to
his divorced wife, and on that "occasion he
swore he was practically penniless. The prin
cipal debts against him are John Freely

NOT GHIRARDELLI'S CHILD.
Sirs. Barbagelata' g Fight for Fortune
Fails.
Judge Coffey has decided that Dominga
Barbagelata, who was petitioning for a
child's share of the estate of Dominga
Ghirardelli, was not Ghirardelli's child.
She was, he decides, the daughter of
Ghirardelli's wife by her first husband.
In the will the following clause was pre
sent :
I bequeath to Dominga or Domini pa Martin,
wife of Francisco Barbagelata, domiciled in
San Francisco, of California, $2000. â¢ â¢ â¢
Mrs. Barbageleta claimed she was
Ghirardelli's child, born before he mar
ried her mother, and sne claimed she had
been recognized as his child by the tes
tator. From the evidence, however, Judge
Coffey has decided that she was Ghi
rardelli's stepdaughter, and entitled to no
more of the estate than the amount spe
cialJy bequeathed to her.
BEFORE THE GRAND JURY
Customs Inspector Williams
Called Upon to Defend
Himself.
Special Agent Moore Anxious to Se

Wong Sam Case.
There is a lull in the Custom-house scan
dal. Major Moore, Special Agent of the
Treasury Department, is not pursuing the
inspectors of the Chinese Bureau with that
same eagerness that distinguished his
movements at the opening of the cam
paign. Whether he is satisfied with bring
ing the investigation before the United
States Grand Jury and leaving it in the
hands of that body for final action, or
whether he has been checkmated by the
department because of his inability to se
cure a conviction in any of the cases(ex
cept one) handled by him since coming to
San Francisco the major will not say. It
is known, however, that he is greatly de
pressed since Collector Wise defeated him
in every turn, and he naturally fears be
ing recalled by Secretary Carlisle.
The charges against "Dick" Williams,
the shifty interpreter of the Custom
house, are before the Grand Jury. The
accused with his attorney, Lyman I.
Mowry, was hefore that body yesterday.
The inspector was called upon to explain
his connection with the unlawful landing
of Chinese at this port and to explain cer
tain services rendered by him for which
he is said to have received money. The
majority of the witnesses atrainst Wil
liams are Chinese and their evidence does
not seem to carry railed weight with the
courts. It is believed in customs circles
that the only salvation for Major Moore is
to secure the conviction of Williams,
otherwise he will be changed from the
agency.
The examination of Wong Sam was con
tinued before United States Commissioner
Heacock yesterday. Miss Cameron and
Miss Culbertson, from the Chinese Presby
terian Mission, testified that Dong Sun
Yet did not leave the mission on the day
that Wong Him and Wong Wing Chew
testified to seeing her in a photograph gal
lery in company with Loui Quong. This
acted as a sort of a bombshell in the camp
of the defense, and an adjournment was
taken until this morning.
NEEDS A HIGH SCHOOL.
Superintendent Babcock Is in
Favor of One in the
Mission.
NUMEROUS SCHOLARS THERE.
Other Districts No More Populous
Are Much More Favored in
This Respect.
The efforts of the residents of the Mis
sion district to have a Tiigti School estab
lished in that locality have met with much
favor in one branch of the municipal gov
ernment â the Board of Education â and if
the wishes of Superintendent of Schools
Babcock and others of the department
go for anything the institution will soon
be an assured thing. Mr. Babcock is em
phatic as to the needs of the Mission in
this respect.
"There is no doubt that the Mission
district should have a High School," said
Mr. Babcock. "While the Mission fur
nishes a large proportion of the pupils in
our public schools, there is not a High
School south of Market. The Western
Addition has two, the Girls' High School
at Geary and Scott streets and the Lowell
High School on Sutter street, near Frank
lin. The north side also has the Poly
technic High School at Bush and Stock
ton streets. The Girls' High School
should have been built somewhere in the
Mission. -.
"At the present time all the school chil
dren who five in the Mission, Potrero and
South San Francisco and attend a high
school have to travel a long distance and
pay carfare, which is an important item
to many people. Some even come from
Ocean View, and one boy in the Loweil
High School conies all the way from the
Six-mile House, on the San Bruno road.
"The Mission is one of the best portions
of the City. The citizens are well-to-do
and of the class who believe in educating
their children, and the fact that their chil
dren must go. such distances must interfere
to some extent.
"The total enrollment of school children
in the City is about 33,000. Of these about
one-half are south of Market street, and in
the district that would be benefited by a
high school in the Missionâ that is from
Fifth street west, and taking in the
Potrero, South San Francisco and Ocean
Viewâ there are 12, % -'Bl school children.
Those living between Fiftn and the water
front, about 4000 in number, would be
divided between the Mission and the other
nigh schools.
"Thus if a high school were established
in the Mission it would immediately have
a larger attendance than any of the other
three, for it would be convenient for at
least 14,000 school children, while the re
maining 19.000 would be divided among
the other three schools.
"The Board of Education has the power
to establish a high school in the Mission if
the Boanl of Supervisors will make a suf
ficient appropriation next year for that
purpose." ________________
lORGERS IN COURT.
Dean Shows a Willlnenets to Plead
Guilty to Save McCluskey.
The two bant forgers, Arthur H. Dean,
alias Frank Severs, and Joseph McCluskey,
who robbed the Nevada BanK, were ar
raigned before Judge Wallace yesterday.
Both pleaded not guilty, but Dean inti
mated that he may withdraw this plea and
plead guilty..
Dean is 'willing to wait for bis trial,
should he go to trial, but McCluske< is
anxious to be tried at once, so Mc'Jluskey f Â§
case was set for April 2 and that of Dean
for April 3. Dean will then be given an
opportunity to change his plea should he
desire to do so. It is supposed that Dean's
expressed willingness to" plead guilty is for
the purpose of keeping out testimony which
will damage McCluskey. The case against
McCluskey is the weakerone, and it is sup
posed that Dean feels his case is hopeless,
and so is willing to sacrifice himself.
A HALL BUILDING.
The Irish Societies Will Give a Picnio
at Schuetzen Park Next
Month.
A meeting of the St. Patrick's Alliance

Park, San Rafael, April 19. Several hun
dred dollars in prizes will be given, includ
ing a gate prize of $20. Irish games,
music and dances will be on the list of ex
ercises.
A meeting was also held in the hall to
consider the question of building a large
edifice which will contain the halls of all

costly structure of the most modern de
sign.
