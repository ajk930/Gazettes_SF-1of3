SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 13.â
This is the first day of the carnivaj weeK
in the famous old carnival town. Santa-
Barbara-at-the-Sea is rousing itself from
dreaminess for one of the gay seasons that
come upon it with the springtime, as the
roses unfold in the bloom.
There are many visitors here, but the
thousands will not arrive until Tuesday
night and Wednesday. Few decorations
car. be seen, for it is too early in the week
for the picKing of the flowers. Some
barren-looking arches are over the streets,
but there is no suggestion in the carpen
ter work of the â¢ beauty that they wilt
yield. On State street, adjoining the pa
vilion grounds, are the long rows of grand
stand benches. These, too, will bloom on
the day of the procession, and with the
beauty that outrivals the radiance of the
roses. Summer costumes were to-day the
enlivening view of the city, and the i
weather is so warm and bright that the
ladies find them tha most comfortaole ap- j
parel.
The event of to-day in the carnival pro
gramme was the production of "As You !
Like It" under the ancient live-oak trees }
at the home of William M. Eddy. The !
carriages from which the iashionably at- â¢
tired residents and visitors alighted at the
gates lined the roadsides for a hundred i

and Rosalind.

yards when the play had begun. The
grand-stand seats were all occupied with
the exception of a few upon which the
sun too warmly shone through an opening
in the trees. Several parties of men
lounged comfortably on the lawn, and
among these were individuals who
were instantly recognized as wealthy
English tourists or mistaken for
such. The orchestra was hidden away in
a bower at the right of the stage area,
an artificial arrangement of evergreen
branches assisting the growing shrubbery
to form the place of concealment. Huge
old oaks were the stage settings, and the
players strolled about the grounds as
naturally as though their actions were of
real life. Beyond the expanse of lawn
ami through the native forest trees some
portions of the imposing front of the
Eddy mansion could be seen ; but it was
an ideal place for "As You Like It."
There were some old playgoers at to
day's performance who declare that Santa
Barbara's amateur society of players has
given the very best representation "of
Shakespeare's comedy ever witnessed on
this coast. The company has been long
in training under the able management of
I. R. Baxley, who as the Jacques of the
cast gave one of the most notable artistic
characterizations of the day, and the per
fect harmony of sentiment existing be
tween the members of the cast and their
director in their conception and presenta
tion of the comedy contributed r.iaterialy
to its success.
No more bewitching Rosalind than Mrs.
Dr. Thaw ever appeared on any stage, nor
was a more original conception of the
character ever presented before a delighted
audience. Mrs. Thaw is a little woman
with an expressive, sparkling little face.
Quick and graceful of movement, uncon
scious of everything but the role she was

enacting, her artless abandon in the forest,
her adroit deception of Orlando, her mis
chievous intercession with the sylvan
lovers, the intense womanliness ever show
ing through her disguise and mocking her
assumption of manly dress and character,
and the undercurrent of merry satire dem
onstrating itself in speech and look and
act, even after her return to the duties of
her exalted station, all combined to give
the audience a Rosalind in distinct con-'
trast to the usual conception.
Orlando was played with spirit by Dr.
Thaw. Mr. Worthington made a delight
ful Touchstone. Amiens was personated
by Robert Fulton, one of the best bary
tone singers in Southern California, and
his two songs evoked enthusiastic applause
and recalls. It is interesting to note that
the exquisite melodies to which these
verses were sung were composed for the
occasion by Gerard Barton of Santa Bar
bara, the musical director who conducted
the orchestra.
Miss Doremus as Audrey played the rus
tic maid quaintly and Miss Doulton and
Miss Fernald, popular society girls, se
cured well-earned applause. Kinton Stev
ens scored a success in William. Indeed
the excellent work done in minor parts
elevated the play to a standard of merit
rarely seen on the professional stage. The
players unquestionably felt the inspira
tion of their surroundings. The day was
! perfect and the sun, glinting through the
green boughs arching overhead, shed a
grateful warmth. The sward that served
as a stage was dappled with sunlight.
Birds sang in the trees overhead and in
the mist of the play an amusing diversion
was created by a pair of bluejays, which,
angry at the prolonged and persistent in
trusion upon their preserves, finally flew
from bough to bough, shrieking their dis
pleasure. The following was the cast of

Mr. Worthington and Mr. Baley are both
gentlemen of wide experience in the di
recting of amateur theatricals, and their
own excellent work and perfect ease gave a
smoothness to the play usually lacking in
amateur performances no matter how
great the talent of the participants.

INTENDED FOR ROOSEVELT.
A Package Containing an Infernal Device
Was Mailed to the Police
Commissioner.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 13.-There
was considerable excitement in the post
office on Sfflrurday night on account of the
arrival of a peculiar-looking package ad
dressed to Commissioner Roosevelt. The
authorities were so sure that it was a dan
gerous machine of some kind that it was
taken out of the regular mails and put in
a place of safety.
An effort to find Roosevelt yesterday
was unsuccessful. To-day Inspect
Meakes of the; general postoffice took the
suspicious package to police headquarters
but was again disappointed, as Roosevelt
had not arrived. The inspector exhibited
the package, and Chief Conlin and the lat
ter advised that investigation be made at
once without waiting for Roosevelt's' ar
rival. .-. y;y. y
3So the package was placed in water to
soak, and when thoroughly wet the wrap
per was carefully torn off. It was found
to contain a genuine bomb, in the shape

of a tube about six inches long, with a cap
at one end. The police will make a full
investigation to ascertain the contents of
the tube. .
After the package had soafced Captain
O'Brien and Roundsman Sweeney opened
it. It was composed of pasteboard, not
metal, as had been supposed. It looked
like a roman-candle. A fuse led to some
matches, that it was intended should have
been ignited when the package was opened.
It contained black powder, which flashed
when touched with alighted match. Pres
ident Roosevelt had not reached head
quarters up to noon.
EXPLOSION OF A PNEUMATIC GUN.
Genera/ Miles and Other Army Officers Had
a Narrow Escape During a
Test.
GLENCOVE, L. 1., April During a
test of the new Dudley powder pneumatic
gun to-day the piece exploded and General
Nelson A. Miles and the members of the
Board of Ordnance had ' a narrow escape
from death, or at least severe injury. A
spectator named Joseph Rome was hit by
a piece of metal and barely escaped with
his life.
The first test had resulted satisfactorily
and for the second experiment a target
composed of a large red, white and blue
flag was put up against a sandbank about
2100 yards distant from the gun. Two of
the dummy missiles had been fired, when,
on the third attempt to discharge the gun,
it exploded, scattering broken fragments
of the gun metal in every direction.
The officers who were investigating the
merits of the gun were standing in a semi
circle behind the piece when it exploded
and it is marvelous ; that none of them
were inj ured. 'â¢>Y> â  : .-'.'.
Mr. Rome was hit on the side of the
neck by a flying; piece of metal and an
ugly wound resulted. ; The explosion put
an end to the tests for the day.
Eight Between Faction a.
â  NEW YORK, N. V., April 13.â A Sun
special from New Orleans says: In East
Baton Rouge Parish Saturday night each
of the two political factions which are con
tending for political supremacy held meet
ings at Spanish town. " ' 'bb? 3 . r '
After the meeting members of the two
factions met each other and a shooting
affray occurred, in which G. Johnson was
killed, his brother, T. Johnson, was seri
ously wounded, Manuel Jackson was mor
tally shot and Deputy Sheriff Duncan was
slightly wounded. Political excitement is
running very high in East Baton Rouge,
but this is the first fatal encounter that has
taken place during the campaign.

HAVANA, Cuba, April 11 (via Tampa,
Fla., April 13).â A1l the tal_ here this
week is' conjecture as to what Mr. Cleve
land will do with the resolutions of the
two houses of Congress. The brief cable
dispatches from the States which the
Havana papers publish after the press
censor has allowed them have been read
with interest by all classes of citizens.
Little light has been thrown upon the sub
ject so far, although the loyal Spaniards
still claim to be confident that the Presi
dent will not recognize belligerency. The
systematic suppression of truthful news of
the progress of the revolution has blinded
many people here, and has undoubtedly
been of great help to Spain abroad. The
official report of every engagement is care
fully cooked so as to make it appear that
the Spanish have won a victory, and even
then, if there is danger of wrong impres
sions being created abroad, the foreign cor
respondents a'-e not permitted to telegraph
the news. On the eve of the elections the
Madrid authorities, , impatient at trivial
items, cabled for encouraging news. The
emergency was met by sending out' the re
port of Gomez' death and designating the
place of his burial in Matanzas, when he
was marching with an escort of 4000 men
in another province.
Spaniards here profess to believe that
President Cleveland will not recognize the
belligerency, of the Cubans, basing their
assurances upon Minister de Lome's dis
patch, but their confidence in Government
messages is weakening. â  There is no wai
talk, among Spaniards here. They Bay
that recognition of belligerency will not
help the -Cubans materially, and claim
that the .ending of additional : men-of-war
from Spain will offset any j advantage
gained. - - â  â 
All talk of compromise between Spain
and the men in arm. is idle.- Cubans have
no faith in the promises of autonomy or
reforms. The insurgent leaders declare
they will never lay down arms until Cuba
is free. .' The decrees of \ General Weyler,
the harsh | treatment of political suspects
and the killing oi pacificos has made com
promise out of the question. All intelli
gent people here recognize that the diffi
culty between Cubans and Spaniards is to
be settled once for all. ...
Insurgents have burned the Moralitos
estate near Jaruco, this province. It is the
property of M. A. de Morales, an Amer
ican citizen, and was spared by the in
surgents on that account until two days
ago. yy'yy YMi
Recently General Melguizo, who has
made himself, particularly offensive by
killing innocent people, encamped on the
estate several times, using the ' sugar
houses for his troops., For this reason the
rebels burned the buildings. The owner
has filed a claim for $200,000 damages with
the American Consul, stating that he re
peatedly asked the Government for pro
tection and did not obtain it. -bbb â¢

Engagement* in Which the Insurgents
Are JJefeated.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 13â Colonel Tort
reports that the column under his com
mand had a series of fights with 2000 in
surgents led by Maceo, Castillo and
others. The scene of the engagements
were south of Guira de Melena, in the
southwestern part of the province, of Ha
vana. The rebels awaited the approach of
the troops with a line of cavalry one kilo
meter in extent, the insurgents on foot
forming an ambush on both sides in the
shape: of a horseshoe. The vanguard of
the troops deployed to the right and . the
artillery fired grenades and grapeshot into
the enemy. The fight lasted two hours.
The rebels then retreated for a distance
and awaited the troops behind the .ruins
of the buildings on the Lvusa estate.', The
troops used ; cannon and made . several
bayonet charges before they succeeded in
?â "<-â  â¢â¢â â â¢ â '" ' ' / '<â  ' -'V â¢ â¢ : :/''â .â '.
dislodging the insurgents. The official
report says the rebels retreated in com
plete disorder, after leaving twenty killed
and eighty wounded. The troops lost five
wounded.
Colonel Segura reports having had an
engagement with insurgents near Piedra,
province of Santa Clara. According to
Colonel Segura, twenty-four rebels were
killed, while the troops had only five of
their number wounded.
Maceo is camping in the hills south of
Cabanas, in the northwestern part of the
province of Pinar del Rio and a compara
tively short distance from Havana. Go
mez is near Sancti Spiritus. yyly'y
It is now said that the elections yester
day, in Sancti Spiritus and Remedios re
sulted in the return of Gonzales Fuentes
and Marin Barcena in place of Augosto de
Figueroa and Martin Zosaya, the candi
dates of the Union Constitutional party,
whose election was announced yesterday.
The election of Senor Barcena, however,
is doubtful.
TTILLIAMS WILL KETIRX;.
The Consul-General to Cuba to be Sue-
eeeded by Jitzhugh Lee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.-The
President to-day sent to the Senate the
nomination of Fitzhugh Lee of Virginia to
be Consul-General of the United States at
Havana, Cuba, vice Ramon C. Wilson, re
signed.
The appointment of a successor to Con
sul-General Williams caused no surprise
in official circles, as it has long been
known that Mr. Williams was anxious to
retire from his position. When Mr. Wil
liams visited the United States last year
he tendered his resignation, but was per
suaded to remain in office on acsount of
the then threatened seriousness of affairs.
Williams had become obnoxious to the
Spanish authorities in Havana on account
of his vigorous manner of caring for the
interests of this Government, and it was
reported that he and Captain-General
Campos had a personal quarrel, in which
strong words were used. In March last
Mr. Williams renewed the expression of
his desire to relinquish his post, and it is
said that he finally agreed to remain until
a successor was appointed, or until the
end of the open seasonâ that is, until the
present time. It has been claimed that
one of the causes why Mr. Williams did
not have the good will of the Spaniards
was that bis brother-in-law managed from
the United States a West Indian express
company suspected of carrying on an un
derground trade with the insurgents.

NEW YORK, N. V., April 13.â Estrada
Palma, Cuban delegate, has received the
following communication from General
Garcia: :/\y \ -' *Â£,
To the people of the United States of America:
lam fully aware of the obligation wftich I
have contracted to stand trial for my alleged
violations of the laws of your country. I
have not remained to face the consequences of
my acts, simply because I feel that I have a
higher duty to perform as a soldier and a
Cuban. Having fought for the independence
of my country for ten years, and having ever
since promulgated the idea for which we then
fought, I deem it my highest and holiest duty
to fight and bleed, and, if necessary die, to at
tain the independence of my country.
Should I fall my death will expiate, I hope,
in your eyes any possible offense for which I
might have to stand trial there; should I sur
vive, I give you my word as a man and
as a soldier to return to your country
and cheerfully abide by the consequences
which the laws of the country may visit upon
me. My conscience tells me that in this pro
ceeding I will satisfy the laws of justice, and
I am confident tnat the citizens of the United

HUNTINGTON MEN AT WORK.
They Expect to Hasten Action by
Congress on the Objectionable
Measure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.-The
Pacific Railroads Committee of the House
to-day authorized its chairman, Powers, to
report the bill drafted by the sub-commit
tee to the House. The measure is prac
tically the same as that printed in Tub
Call of March 31, with the several unim
portant changes as printed in The Call on
last Tuesday. There was barely a quorum
present.
The vote stood 7 in favor of the bill and
2 against. The two who will compose the
minority are . Hubbard of Missouri and
Bell of Texas, but Kyle of Mississippi and
possibly one other member may conclude
to sign a minority report which Hubbard,
is now preparing. There were five ab
sentees besides Boatner, whose seat has
been vacated. .The absentees were: Hep
burn, Kyle, Johnson" of California, Harri
son and Sulzer. The seven who voted to
report the bill were : Powers of Vermont,
Wright of Massachusetts, Watson of Ohio,
Black of New York, Arnold of Pennsyl
vania, Faris of Indiana and Patterson of
Tennessee.
A report was in circulation to-day that
Speaker Reed had decided to not recognize
the bill at this session, but this cannot be
verified, and is contrary to the general ex
pectation that the bill will be considered
in the House before adjournment. The
fact that Grove L. Johnson was not pres
ent at to-day's session of the committee
was a subject of comment, but any criti
cism passed upon him is unjust, for John-
son is quite sick with la grippe at the Ho
tel Cochran, in this city. "\ bbb-b
The new bill will probably be known as
the "Powers bill" ; at any rate, the vener
able chairman of the House committee
seems to be quite anxious to father the
measure. He was very careful to inscribe

An Old Controversy Over
Printing Is Brought
Up Again.
ONE CONTRACT OPPOSED.
All the Republicans Voted
Against Receding From an
Amendment.
THE MAYBRICK CASE DROPPED
Owing to a Lack of Jurisdict on the
Resolution of Remonstrance Is
Reported Adversely.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 13.â The j
investigation of Patent Office matters by
the Senate Committee on Printing two
years ago in connection with Josiah
Quincy, Assistant Secretary of State, who
objected to severe criticism, was recalled
by an incident in the Senate proceedings
to-day. Mr. Quincy had been interested
while in office in procuring for a business
friend a contract for printing the Patent
Office Gazette at rates very much less than
those at which the work had been done so i
many years by an electrotype printing j
firm in Washington.
When the Legislative appropriation bill j
was before the Senate some weeks ago an
amendment was offered and agreed to ask
ing the extension of that contract for
another year. The conference report on
that bill, which was made to-day, left that
amendment as one of those on which the
conferees had not agreed. Thereupon
Gorman (D.) of Maryland, who was chair
man of the Committee on Printing when
that investigation was made, moved that
the Senate recede from the amendment,
and his motion was agreed to, 28 to 25,
although it was opposed by the chairman
of the Committee on Patents (Piatt, R., of
Connecticut), and was voted against by
nearly all the Republican Senators.
- The Judiciary Committee of the Senate
spent some time in disposing of the joint
resolution referred to last Thursday, pro
posing a remonstrance with the British
Government in the matter of the imprison
ment of Mrs. Maybrick. The joint resolu
tion was reported back to-day adversely
on the ground that the Senate had no jur
isdiction over the subject. The report was
placed on the calendar and will probably
not be heard of again.
The main part of the day's session was
occupied with speeches on the Dupont
election case, Burrows of Michigan and
Brown of Utah arguing in favor of Mr.
Dupout's right to the seat.
The Senate at 5:10 adjourned.
- To-day's session of the House under the
rules was devoted to consideration of busi
ness pertaining to the District of Columbia
and various matters of local interest were
disposed of. A bill to regulate marriage
in the District provoked a long discussion.
Owing to the absence of a quorum on the
vote ordering the previous question on its
passage the Hou3e at 4:30, without dispos
ing of the bill, adjourned until to-morrow.
IN THE SUPREME COURT
An Important Decision Relating
to Eond Litigation in
Mississippi.
The Use of the Term " Gold Coin"
Does Not Invalidate the
Issue.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.â
Supreme Court of the United States recon
vened after a ten days' recess and handed
down opinions in a score and a half of
cases. Mississippi litigation was the occa
sion of the most important, if not the
most interesting decisions. Amos Wood
ruff, trustee of the German Bank of Mem
phis, holders of certain bonds issued by
the Mississippi Levee Board No. 1 brought
suit in the court of Hinds County, that
State, to enforce a lien and trust upon cer
tain lands in that county, created in their
favor as holders of such bonds. These
bonds were issued in 1871, and were made
payable in "gold coin," although the in
terest coupons were payable in "lawful
money." The case went against the plain
tiffs, and the Supreme Court of the State
affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
In its decision the Supreme Court said:
"When the bonds were issued 'gold coin'
was not the basis of the business of the
country. It was money, but of much
greater value than the circulating me
dium, consisting of United States treasury
notes and of National ______ notes, of which
we take judicial notice. All debts payable
in 'dollars' generally were as now, solvable
in legal tenders, but an obligation payable
in gold can be discharged only according
to its terms. In authorizing the issuance
of bonds from 11,000.000 and in the use of
the term ,'money' the Legislature must be
supposed to have meant in the act cited
that money which constituted the basis of
the general business of the country and
was a legal tender for the payment of
debts. Therefore there was no authority
in the act for the issuance of bonds paya
ble in gold coin, and they were void for
want of authority for their issuance."
From this decision the bond-owners ap
pealed to the Supreme Court of the United
States. The opinion of the court was an
nounced by Chief Justice Fuller. It dis
cussed at great length the question
whether or not "gold coin" was "money,"
and reached the conclusion that is was
money, and therefore that the use of that
term in a bond issued under authority to
borrow money was not invalid. The
judgment of the Supreme Court of tie
State was reversed and the cause remanded,
with instructions to proceed in a manner
not inconsistent with the opinion.
. Unusual features were shown in the case
of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company
vs. George S. Lewis et al., appealed from
the Circuit Court for Montana. Lewis et
a!, sued the railroad company for the
value of 10,000 cords of wood destroyed by
lire caused by a spark from one of the rail
road company's engines.
The railroad company set up that Lewis
et al. were not the rightful owners of the
wood, it having been cut by them without
authority upon Government land. The
Montana court held that their title was
good against' the railroad company and
cave ' judgment in their favor. The Su
preme Court, in an . opinion read by Jus
tice Peckham, reversed the judgment and
remanded the case, holding that the title
of Lewis et al. was not sufficient to entitle
them to recover.
Justice Harlan announced the decision
of the court upon the validity of an act
passed by the Legislature of Arizona, in
which the limits within which the courts
may act in determining the action of the
Legislature were defined. The case was
that of W. A. Harwood vs. A. Went
worth, a contest for possession of
the office of Recorder of Cochise
County, in that Territory, the
question involved being whether or not the
act in question was to take effect January
1, 1897, or at the time of passage. The
official document did not contain that
stipulation, and it was sought to show by
parol evidence that the original bill was
so amended.
Justice Harlan stated that in line with

PALMER AT WASHIXGIOX.
Trying to Wind Vp the Affair* of the
World* Fair.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.â Ex-
Senator Palmer has come to Washington
on business connected with the settlement
of the affairs of the Columbian Expo
sition and says he will not leave the cap
ital until matters are satisfactorily ar
ranged. '-Ample authority has been given
the Secretary of the Treasury to distribute
the medals and diplomas," said the for
mer ruler of the White City, "and it was
our wish that the exhibitors should have
had both by March lof this year. Still we
are counting on everything being cleared
up, so far as the bureau of awards is con
cerned, by May 1, 1896."
RUSH OF PAUPER LABOR
Thousands of Italian Immigrants
Coming to the United
States.
Many of Them Are Without Means
and Will Not Ec Permitted
to Land.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 13.â The
steamer Bolivia of the Anchor line arrived
from Genoa and Naples yesterday. She
brought 1376 Italian immigrants. Six
hundred of them were detained at Ellis
Island, on the ground that they are likely j
to become public charges. Of this number '.
none had more than a dollar or so, while j
many of them were practically penniless, j
Dr. Senner said that only 10 per cent of
those detained would be allowed to land. j '
The steamer Alesia of the Fabre line, I
also from Naples, reached the bar last
night with 1064 more on board. They were
landed at Ellis Island to-day. The immi- !
gration authorities are surprised at the !
great influx of Italian paupers. More than
15,000 have already arrived, and Dr. Senner
baa received advices that 15,000 more are
about to sail from Naples. Dr. Senner is j
very alert, and is enforcing the immigra- :
tion laws to the letter, particularly in the j
case of Italians, in the hopes of discourag- ;
ing their fellow-countrymen, but this ap-.
parently has no effect on them.
"What they will do in this country I am
at a loss to comprehend," said Commis- j
sioner Senner. "Already this year we have
admitted more than 1*5,000 "Italians. A I
cable dispatch last Thursday stating that
15,000 more were ready to start from Na
ples is correct, and they will come along
as soon as they secure passage, so you see
that before spring melts into summer we
shall have an additional 30,000 of Italy's j
refuse population to compete with Ameri- j
can laborers. Many of those who arrived j
yesterday had not sufficient money with j
which to purchase a pint of bad claret. In j
a great many instances $1 represented their
financial possessions, and a majority will
undoubtedly be sent back.
"Another Anchor line steamer, the Bel- : j
gravia. is now on her way to this port I
from Naples, and will arrive in about
three weeks with 1400 more Italians.
There are several causes to which we
might attribute the extraordinary output
from Italy. The prime cause to my mind,
however, the great dissatisfaction with
the condition of their native country. It !
is probably a fact that a large percenage
coming here are fleeing to escape being
pressed into service as soldiers. Then,
again, they may be rushing over for fear
the introduction of an educational test to
strengthen our immigration laws might
keep them out later.
"What I might term the semi-official
indorsement of several large colonization
schemes, which have also been sanctioned
by the Italian Embassador, may have
something to do with the sudden exodus
from Italy. It is a mistaken idea in the
minds of a great many that immigration
generally is increasing. That is not so.
Outside of special Italian immigration our
statistics show a decrease of more than 40
per cent since the immigration laws were
made more stringent in 1893."
AFTER RAILROAD OFFICIALS.
Unfair Discriminations May Cause a
Batch of Indictments.
CHICAGO, 111.. April 13.â Subpenas for
scores of the highest railroad officials
living here and in the East, for the biggest
packers of meat, shippers of dressed beef,
manufacturer- and wholesale merchants,
have been issued by authority of the
United States Court for this district, com
manding the appearance of these promi
nent citizens before the next Federal
Grand Jury, which meets here May 4.
A supreme effort is to be made by the
District Attorney, Mr. Black, his special
assistant, . Mr. Landis, and the agents of
the Interstate Commerce Commission to
indict railroad officials and shippers for
discrimination in making and receiving â 
rates, at the same time making .
use of such testimony which may !
be secured from witnesses under the '
protection and compulsion afforned by ;
the Brown decision of the Supreme Court, '<
to prove the existence of a beef trust
among Chicago packers. The closest
secrecy has been observed in the offices of
the District Attorney and United States
Marshal as to the mode of procedure, and
the Grand Jury, which was drawn last
week, was selected with exceptional care,
in view of the important work to come be
fore it.

THE SAN "FRANCISCO CALL, TTJ AY, APRIL 14, 1596.
FIRST DEFEAT
FOR GRIFFO.
McKeever of Philadelphia
Proves to Be a Better
Boxer.
BOTH IN GOOD FORM.
For the First Five Rounds the
Australian Did the Most
Effective Work.
THEN THE FIGHTING CHANGED
During the Remainder of the Contest
the Man From the Antipodes Was â¢
on the Defensive.
i MASPETH, L. 1., April 13.â Griffo- \
McKeever contest, which was the star at
traction at the Empire Athletic Club to
night, drew but a slim crowd, owing to a
report during the afternoon that Griffo had
been arrested on a charge of being about
to participate in a prize, fight, and that to
night's contest would in consequence be
put off. The Australian was arrested but
was released.
The curtain-raiser was a ten-round bout
between Fred Morris, better known as
"Muldoon's Cyclone," and Charley Strong
of Newark, both colored. Strong got the
decision.
Shortly after 9 o'clock the stars appeared.
Griffo had trained with more than usual
steadiness for this contest, while McKeever
was also in great form. The first five
rounds were in favor of Griffo, but the
rest of the fight was to McKeever's credit.
He was the aggressor until the end of the
twentieth round and frequently had Griffo
on the ropes. Griffo defended himself su
perbly, but did not try to score points by
leading.
The referee declared McKeever the win
ner, a decision that met with almost uni
versal favor. This was the Australian's
first actual defeat in this country, where
his wonderful skill as a defensive boxer
gained him a great reputation.
SOME OLDTIME BASEBALL.
Rain Stopped a Contest Between Veterans
of the Sixties.
ROCKFORD, 111., April 13. â Rain
stopped the most unique game in the his
tory of baseball to-day. Veterans of the
sixties, whose names were once household
words, met in a contest according to the
old rules that gave the batter nine balls,
made a foul on a bound out, and caused a
runner to be called out if he overran first
base.
The umpire of the game was H. H.
Waldo, 76 years of age, known ' as the
"Father of the Forest Citys," which team
was organized here in 1865 and played
until 1875, being one of the most- famous
clubs in the country. The game to-day
was in honor of Harry Wright, the pro
ceeds going to the erection of a monument
to him in Philadelphia. It was made a
reunion of the players of the old Forest
City team, and a number of players who
had been prominent in other teams volun
teered services.
One team was made up of A. G. Spald
ing, G. E. King, Frank Trumbull, Al Bar
ker, M. L. Wheeler, R. C. Buckman, W.
L. Lighthart, B. Osborne and Fred Cone.
The other club consisted of "Cherokee"
Fisher, M. Larue, Harry Starr, W. S.
Steams, Dan O'Leary, E. C. Dunn, George
Wright, C. T. Page and M. H. Golden.
Spalding and King and Fisher and Larue
formed the batteries. George Wright, a
brother of Harry Wright, played shortstop
for his team. The Forest City's blanked
their opponents, and in their half batted
out four runs, when a heavy rainstorm
stopped the game. The attendance .was
2500, tbe threatening weather keeping
thousands away.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 13.â A game
of ball of unusual interest was played here

nine of 1882, which won the American As
sociation pennant of that year, and this
year's Cincinnati National League club.
The game was for the benefit of the Harry
Wright monumont fund and over 3000
people were in attendance. The leaguers
won by a score of 7 to 3. ; y- :i !-

an unqualified success. About 500 persona
saw a tedious game between the New
Yorks and Metropolitans. New York won
by a score of 14 to 4.
BALTIMORE, Mo., April 13.â Harry
Wright day was all that the average base"
ball enthusiast could desire in the way of
warm, sunshiny weather, and 1500 people
attended the game this afternoon. The

BOSTON, Mass., April 13.-The billiard
tournament which was opened to-night by
Schaefer and Gamier, was won by the
former. It is the second in the series of
international billiards between Gamier,
Schaefer, Ives and Daly, the last named

beautiful return bank and an all-round the
table shot in the third.
The thirteenth inning. was productive of
but one for the Wizard, and was barren
for the Belgian. The score was: Schaefer,
80: Gamier, 50. When the sixteenth inn
ing opened the balls were rolling just right
for Jake. He nursed them ; at the rail for
16 counts, and .then brought down the
house by driving the object ball the length
of the table and the other across for a
gather. He counted ~ fast 'â¢â  until 32 â¢ was
called, and slipped up on a masse, a fear
fully hard try. Jake got the spheres up
against the rail for^ cushion-carom nurse
in the twenty-fifth, and made 39. A kiss

thirty-first inning. It : :-.*.?, was made

in Several Mexican
' Towns.
CITY OF MEXICO, Mexico, April 13.â
A telegram from Oaxaca City says the
rebel Indians at the town of Juquela killed
all the Town Councilors, school teachers,
local priest, Chief of Police and the tele
graph operator, all . holding Government
places. v Troops have been sent for.
The recent military movement against
the rebel Zimatlans has resulted in driving
the Indians into the mountains. They be
gan their plotting in Holy Week, incited
by Indian lawyers, who informed them
that the new State taxes were unconstitu
tional.
The authorities paid no attention to the
excitement among them, thinking they
were engaged in their drunken celebration
of the season.
They procured arms and captured the
Town Hall. They sacked the place;
and penetrating the private apartments of
the prefect, grossly maltreated the women
of his family, and murdered and wounded
nearly all of the servants and officials.
After sacking the Town Hall the mob
went to the Federal stamp office and as
sailed it, burning down the outside door
with petroleum, which communicated fire
to the entire house. â .'.'. '.',â  7

NEW LAND BILL
FOR IRELAND.
Introduced in the House of
Commons by Mr.
Balfour.
INTRICATE CHARACTER.
Successive Measures Tending to
Extra Holdings of Farmers
and Peasants. .
RELIEF FOR THE TENANTS.
John Di lon Says the Irish Will Be
Disappointed With the Scheme
Proposed.
LONDON, Eng., April 13.â Gerald Bal
four, Chief Secretary for Ireland, intro
duced the Irish land bill in the House of
Commons to-day. In doing so he referred
to its complex and intricate character, and
said it was more like a collection of small
bills than a comprehensive measure
formed to carry out a basic proposal. Mr.
Balfour reviewed the effects of the succes
sive land acts as tending to extend the
holdings of farmers and peasant?. He
held that the Ashbourne act of 1885 better
assisted to the purchase of land than the
act of 1891. The present measure would
carry out the best principles of the Ash
bourne act, would' adopt several of the
features of Mr. Morley's bill of 1895 and
would add a series of provisions amending
the precedure of previous acts and facili
tate a working purchase system. Regard
ing arrears the bill proposed that a tenant
who was able could in all cases. redeem his
holding by the payment of two years'
arrears, leaving the landlord to recover ar
rears beyond this period by ordinary pro
cedure. The bill did not abolish the land
lord's right of pre-emption.
The scheme for fixing the judicial rents
proposed a term of thirty years' duration,
but this would be available every five
years on the application of either landlord
or tenant. In regard to the purchase of
lands, Mr. Balfour said that whereas the
present time for the repayment of the sum
advanced for purchase extended over forty
nine years in continuous payments of 4
per cent, the present bill proposed to ex
tend the bill to seventy years.
The Right Hon. John Morley, Chief Sec
retary for Ireland in the Liberal Govern
ment, said he was pleased with parts of the
bill, chiefly those that had been adopted
from the Liberal bill. He was disappointed
with the other clauses, part of which were
quite unworkable.
John Dillon, leader of the anti-Parnell
ites, said Mr. Balfour's speech proved that
this Parliament was incapable of dealing
with the question. The Irish would be
greatly disappointed by the bill.
The bill then passed its first reading.
The second reading was fixed for April 27.
NO REDUCTION IN TARIFF
General Managers of the West
ern Passenger Association
Have Agreed.
Every Theatrical and Permanent
Traveling Party Mnst Pay
Full Rates.
CHICAGO, 111.. April 13.â The general
managers of the Western Passenger Asso
ciation railroads, after a long special meet
ing to-day, reached an agreement in rela
tion to party rates within the most im
portant part of their territory â accomplish-
ing what the passenger agents failed in
doing last week. They decided that after
May 1 no reduction from the tariff rates
should be given to parties of any character,
the party rate to be taken out entirely in
the territory east of the Missouri River.
This action puts the railroad officials
squarely and legally before the Interstate
Commerce Commission, but it also com
pels every theatrical and permanent trav
eling party to pay full rates. The managers
decided to refer the matter of party rates
in the territory west of the Missouri River
to the special meeting of the Trans-Mis
souri Association, which was called to-day
to be held in Denver next Thursday for
various business. yy--y y-'y â 
THROWN INTO A MINE HOLE.
Andrew Munar Perishes From the Treat-
ment Received at the Hands of
Two Highwaymen)
HAZLETON, Pa.. April Andrew
Munar died at' his home near Jeddo yes
terday morning and another shocking
murder is added to the many committed
in this region. Munar is the victim of
highway robbery, and, as in previous cases
here, there is no clew as to the. identity of
the assassins. Although the attack upon
Mv nar occurred nearly a week ago the cir
cumstances were not made pub lie until his
death occurred. :
Last Monday night Munar was in Free
land and . took the trolley as far as Japan
station when going home. On the same
car were two other men, unknown to the
conductor. They also left the car at
Japan. Munar was found the next morn
ing at the bottom of a mine hole. He re
covered sufficiently to tell', what happened
to him, but could not identify his assas
sins. â  -
After leaving the car. the two men re
mained behind him until crossing the
flats, when they closed in upon him and
demanded his money. Munar was-un
armed, but determined to fight. He was
felled with a club, however, and kicked
into submission. . After the brigands had
taken his watch and cash they threw him
in the hole.
BARROOMS WERE CLOSET).
But Plenty of Liquor Waa Obtained in
.' Xew York and â  Brooklyn. - ; :
NEW YORK, N.Y., April 13. â The
Raines law did not give New York a dry
Sunday yesterday, it only reduced ;. the
number of places where liquor could be
openly obtained to the; city's 500 hotels
and added the price of a sandwich to the
cost of a drink. It enabled tbe man who
' sat in a hotel cafe with an untouched mor
sel of bread before him to have the table
covered with a dozen bottles, if he bo de
sired. It prevented the man who ordered
a six-course dinner in a table d'hote res
taurant from being served with any kind
of liquor. ,
The whole question of Sunday prohibi
tion depended on whether the proprietor
had ten bedrooms somewhere about his
place of business or not. In most of these
rooms the necessary furniture had simply
been thrown in and if any man applied
for lodging in these subterfuge hotels he
would be turned away.
But of the city's 7000 barrooms not one
was open. The screens were thrown back
ana the bars plainly exposed to view from
the street. "No policemen stood guard at
side doors. In Brooklyn ail that the
thirsty had to drink was obtained in tlie
same manner. There were more evi
dences of drunkenness on the streets there
than in New York however. It is evident,
however, tnat the open sesame to cold
bottles in New York is the inoffensive
sandwich.
WORE THE WIFE'S CLOAK.
That Is Why Augusta Bartz Received a
Charge of Shot Intended for
Mrs. Beak.
NEW HAMPTON, lowa. April 13.â Mike
Bartz, Mike Bartz Jr. and Augusta Bartz
are lying at the point of death from gun
shot wounds inflicted by Herman Boak,
who is a son-in-law of Bartz and is
divorced from his wife. Bartz and his
two children, who live southwest of the
city, were returning from church yester
day, the girl wearing a cloak that belonged
to Mrs. Boak. Boak was concealed in the
brush, and when they came opposite he
emptied two barrels from a shotgun at
them, both taking effect, Augusta receiv
ing the first charge in the side and the
other one striking the boy and father.
He came to town immediately after
committing the crime ana gave himself up
to the Sheriff. He was under bonds to
keep the peace for threatening to kill his
; wife. He mistook the girl for his wife.
VICTIMS OF A MAD HORSE
Two Prominent Stock â¢ Dealers
Assailed and Fatally
Trampled On.
One Rushed to tbe Otter's Assistance
and Both Met a Terrible
Fate.
CHICAGO, 111., April 13.â Free Kenyon,
junior member of the firm of Marsh &
Kenyon, prominent stock-dealers at the
stockyards, and Charles Bradway, an
Eastern horse and cattle buyer, were both
fatally injured by a vicious horse at the
stockyards at 3:15 this afternoon. Mr.
Bradway died a few moments later and
Mr. Kenyon is not expected to live.
The horse was being shown to the two
men in the horse sale stables near Thirty
ninth street, when in some manner he got
loose. Rushing viciously at Mr. Kenyon
the horse knocked him down, trampled
upon him and fractured his skull. Mr.
Bradway attempted to assist Mr. Kenyon,
but he was also attacked by the infuriated
beast, knocked down and his skull almost
literally pounded to pieces.
Mr. Kenyon was removed to the Transit
House, where medical attendance was at
once provided for him. His injuries are
fatal.

Mr. William J. Carey has used Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla and heartily in-
dorses the remedy. Said "tie ."This is to
certify that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
has cured me completely of chronic indi-
eestion, with which I had been troubled
since I was a boy. I could scarcely keep
anything on my stomach. The burning
pain in my throat and stomach was so bad
at times that it would make the water roll
down my cheeks in streams from my eyes.
I have had malaria also. I have used
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla and now can
truthfully say I am well. I feel well in
every limb. I will cheerfully recommend
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla to any one
who will call or write to me.

M'KINLEY HEADS THE LIST.
-Eight Delegates Classed as Doubt

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13.âRep
resentative Aldrich of Illinois gives out
the following statement to-night of Mr.
Reed's strength as compared with that of
other candidates and submits the ap
pended table, which he says is made up
from reliable information furnished by
delegates, and in some cases by chairmen
of conventions.
"To be sure," he says, "there are con
tests in several places, where it would be
unfair to predict the action of the conven
tion. For instance, the entire Mississippi
delegation will be contested and we place
them in the doubtful column. The only
'speculation' in this list is in the doubtful
column. Newspaper rumors do not figure
in it stall."

CELEBRATED AT M OXTICELL O.
Democrats Honor the Memory of Thomas
Jfffcrson.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., April 13.â
Under the auspices of the National Asso- !
ciation Democratic Club, the one hundred
and fifty-third anniversary of the birth of
Thomas Jefferson, founder of the Demo- ''
cratic party, was celebrated to-day at 'â â 
Monticello, where the author of the Dec- |
laration of Independence lived and died. !
At noon a special train from Washington
arrived, bringing a distinguished party of
Democrats.
Among them were Vice-President Ste
venson. Postmaster-General Wilson, At
torney-General Harmon, Secretary of the
Navy Herbert, Senators Jones of Ar
kansas, Faulkner of West Virginia, Pasco
of Florida, George of Mississippi, Martin
of Virginia, Mitchell of Wisconsin, White
of California. Roach of North Dakota, and
Representatives Sulzer of New York,
Washington of Tennessee, Clardy of Ken
tucky, Swanson, Tyler and Tucker of Vir
ginia, Pendleton of Texas, Patterson of
Tennessee, Williams of Mississippi, Law
son, Livingston and Turner of Georgia, and I
Maguire of California.
The guests were driven to Monticello, \
where tbe party was entertained at
luncheon by Jefferson Levy, a descendant
of . the great Democrat. The formal pro
ceedings began by an address by Hon.
Chauncey F. Black, whose enunciation of
the sentiment of Jefferson,- that the pri- j
mary principle of Democracy was "abso- j
lute acquiescence in the decisions of the
majority," was heartily applauded. Ex- !
Governor Russell of Massachusetts, orator
of the day, was received by a crowd with
ringing cheers. His patriotic allusions '
were rapturously applauded. The cele- I
bration was a great success.

tint,.
WASHINGTON; D. C, April 13.-A re
cently published article entitled "Leo's
Plans in Mexico" stated that an alleged
appointment in St. Louis, Mo., between
Monsignor Averardi. the Apostolic visitor
to Mexico, and Cardinal Satolli was made
at I the Mexican .legation last March,
and the report of an alleged interview with
the lirat secretary of the Mexican lega
tion as given afterward. The statement
could not be verified owing to Mr. Rome
ro's temporary absence from Washington,
but he. having returned to-day. said to a
reporter that the only intercourse he ever
had with Monsignor Averardi was a short
visit of a purely social character which
that prelate paid aim when he came to
Washington on his way to Mexico. Mr.
Romero returned the call in the afternoon
01 the same day, but he did not find him
at home.

through the mail ana an investigation
disclosed the bodies cold in death. Mr.

An Unnatural Affection Causes Mary

and Suicide.
ELGIN, 111., April Mary Linnet of
403 North Campbell avenue, Chicago, shot
and instantly killed Elizabeth Trowbridge,
a prominent young lady of this city, and
then killed herself this evening.
The double tragedy occurred on South
State street about 8 o'clock. The mur
deress was a former patient at the in
sane asylum and was discharged as cured
in December. Miss Trowbridge was her
attendant and she conceived a passionate
affection for her. She came here this
morning to induce Miss Trowbridge to re
turn to Chicago to live with her. Miss
Trowbridge could not be induced to do
this and the girl determined to kill her
friend and herself rather than be separ
ated.
Miss Linnet was 18 years of age and
about two years ago tried to kill a girl
friena in Chicago for whom she had an
unnatural affection. Miss Trowbridge
was 25 years old and' a niece of Judge
David Sherwood of this city.
YAMAGATA IX XEW Y&RK.
I Made a Rapid Run to' the Xation'a Me
tropolis.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 13.â A special
train carrying Count Yamagata and party
arrived at the Grand Central depot from
Albany about 6 o'clock this evening.
The run from Albany was without inci
dent. At West Point the military academy
was pointed out to the Count, and he re
! called General Gant's visit to Japan and
spoke feelingly of the great commander-in
; chief.
The speed of the train was a consider
' able source of wonder and amazement to
j the party. At the Grand Central depot a
I party of about 300 welcomed the guests
i and they were driven -to the Waldorf
| Hotel, where apartments had been se
: cured for them. Shortly after leaving Al
i bany .the marshal said to The United
Press representative: V _ /-_,.. 'T
"When I came to America before I felt
; that I was going among strangers; now I
: feel that I am in a country where friends
! welcome me ; with wide-open arms. In
| stead of traveling as an unknown stranger,
; I have been made to leel that I am indeed
| a welcome friend. How gratifying this is
to me no words of mine can express. The
depth of my appreciation neither' can
I words speak.
"But I do not see that I deserve the
honors so lavishly showered upon me. I
have done my duty only tc my Empeior
and country. The humblest, soldier of
Japan did the same. We did all we could
I for our country â no more, no less. My

HUMBRECHT IX MEXICO.
i Badly Wanted in. Many Citie* for Bold
Swindles.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 13.â Many
people in this city remember Victor J.
I Humbrecht of Terra Alta subdivision
; fame, who is said to have swindled many
people, and his one-time business partner,
j Louis Pullman, who was a prominent
j dealer. They purchased Terra Alta and
| conducted it for some time.
One day it was discovered that Hum
brecht had mysteriously disappeared; and
sensational developments followed in
rapid succession. It was . alleged . that he
made many fraudulent transfers of real
estate, and his victims lost everything. A
sensational expose followed, and since that
time nothing has ever been heard from
him.
A former Cincinnatian, now located at
Pomona, Cal., sends to a friend news of
Humbrecht, which has just come to light.
He is said to have operated in the same
manner there, and the information is that
he is wanted on similar charges in Chicago,
Astoria, Portland, Salt Lake and Denison,
Tex. He is now â  said to be in Mexico on
a pleasure jaunt. .

Hill Faction Jubilant Over the
Result of the Bitter
Contest.
RESULTS IN OTHER TOWNS.
Local Issues Predominate Over Par

SAUSALITO, Cal., April 13.â One
of the most exciting and hotly con
tested elections ever held in the town of
Sausalito took place _ to-day, and as a
result John E. Creed, the town Marshal,
and Alfred Brandes, the night watchman,
are under arrestâ Creed on a warrant
Joseph 11. Pryson, Town Clerk-Elect of Sausalito.
charging, him with battery, sworn to by
Brandes, and Brandes on a charge of carry
ing a concealed weapon, preferred against
him by. Creed. Bad feeling had existed
between the two men for some time.
The accounts of the fracas between the
two men is varied, as every man's tale is
colored by his partisanship. Creed's tale
is that he entered Friedler's store with a
friend, not knowing that Brandes was
there. Hearing Brandes mention his
name in a caustic manner he walked up to
him and said:
"Brandes, you must cease talking about
me. I will settle things with you after
election."
Brandes thereupon, according to Creed,
called him a foul name and reached for
his pistol, when Creed 'â¢ hit him twice,
knocking him down, disarmed him and
arrested him for carrying a concealed
weapon.
Brandes, however, tells an entirely dif
ferent story. He says: ' bbv-Vf.f
"I was standing in the entrance to the
store, talking to Charles Ulrich, a reporter
Deputy Constable Cramer, Cheered by a
Hilarious Populace, Places Burly
Marshal Creed Under Arrest. - i- ;
[Sketched by a " Call" artist.]
on a San Francisco evening paper, when
Creed came up and struck me in the back
of tbe neck, took my revolver from me
while I. was down and then arrested me.
About two hours afterward I had him ar
rested for battery." ,-,
Creed was released on his own recogni
zance, but Braudes, after being .bound
over to keep the peace, was released on
$100 bonds. >. y. . - . b'bb:
The result of the election was a great
victory for the hill faction. The number
of votes cast was 327, the largest number
of votes ever polled at a Sausalito elec
tion. The votes for tne various candi
dates stand as follows:

When the result became known ' the i
town rang with the yells of the victorious
hill faction.
The hottest fight was over the marshal
ship; but, though the supporters both of
Brandes and Eustace professed implicit
taith in the triumph of their candidates,
it was plainly to be seen that a majority
was in favor of Creed. â  The number ;' of
votes polled for him clearly indicates the
general consensus of opinion.
Said General John H. Dickinson, him
self elected Trustee: Â
"We had a pretty hard time to incorpo
rate this town four" years ago. Now there
seems to be a sentiment in some quarters
to disincorporate. I do not believe it is
very strong. Taking an active interest in
the welfare of the community I deem it
my duty to place myself where I can work
for the welfare of the place.
"There has been considerable newspaper
talk here recently anent the record
of Creed. , I am not one of . those
who believe that a man should be held
down because he is alleged at one time to
have been under a cloud. Creed has
shown himself to be an efficient officer,
has handled picnic crowds in a very satis
factory manner, and the majority, by
their votes, prove that he is the best man
for the place." _â¢â â¢/â . â¢
The town clerkship was another posi
tion bitterly contested. Pryor's friends
were the only ones that rolled the
prophetic eye and named the winner.
Events prove them true prophets. â . As
Pry or himself said: "The only thing any
body has against me is that I want the
earth. I hold three offices already and
edit the News besides. If I am elected
Clerk I shall be satisfied." y'y
The election for Treasurer _was also very
close, but no bitterness of feeling existed
between the candidates. Fiedler's small
majority shows the men to be of about
equal popularity.
Besides the Brandes-Creed fistic contest,
there were a number of other exciting
bouts occurred during the day. Much
blood was spilled, but no bones broken. The
small vote polled for Brandes is said to be
the result of his forwarding a request to
the Sheriff for deputies to keep the peace
during election. As one tipsy and indig
nant gentleman put it, "We don't want
people to think this election took place in
Arizona." 'Vy--
j But by far the most sensational and
amusing event of the day was Creed's ar
rest by 'Gene Cramer, a deputy constable.
Creed weighs about .500 pounds and is a
giant in stature, while Cramer is a diminu
tive fellow weighing very little over 100
pounds. As the small man gripped the
large man 'tightly by the arm as if he
feared he might try to escape, and led tbe
lamb-like giant along the street to the
office of the Justice of the Peace, the
whole populace, irrespective of* sex, color,
or nationality, turned out to Bee the fun.
Said a local politician, "I would rather
have had my candidate beaten than
missed the sight."

Voters Decide Against Protection of the
City From Flood*.
STOCKTON. Cal., April 13.â An election
was held ii\_l<this city to-day to de
cide whether or not to vote $141,800 bonds
to protect the city from oveiflow. For
several years floods have damaged the
city to the extent of many thousands of
dollars, and a drainage system was pro
posed to prevent further overflow. This
system was prepared by City Surveyor H.
T. Compton and approved by Major Heuer
of the United States army, at that time in
charge of the United States engineering
department in this State. Many of the
property-owners* who own tracts on the
islands opposed 'the plan because they
favored another that involved greater ex
pense and would at the same time drain
their lands on the islands. As the result
of the election no bonds will be issued, the
proposition having failed to carry Dy 125

FIVE DECREES GRANTED.
Severing, of Marital Ties Denied

Petitioners.
ONE DEFAULT IS SET ASIDE.
The Taking of Testimony in Two
Suits Completes the Record-
Breaking Performance.
â  â  ' : -.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 13.â A1l previous
records in divorce proceedings in Santa
Clara County were smashed this morning, j
when Judge Reynolds disposed- of seven j
suits in less than an hour. In five cases \
the decrees were granted, but the other j
two were denied. Besides the cases dis- !
posed of the default of the defendant in j
another suit was set aside and the testi- J
mony in two additional cases submitted.
The first case disposed of was the suit of j
Monroe C. Park for a divorce from Lucy j
E. Park, on the ground of cruelty, which j
was denied. They were, married in this I
State in 1868 and have four children. The j
charge of cruelty preferred by Park was
contradicted by Mrs. Park and the court
held there was not sufficient evidence to
warrant a divorce.
Jane Yates was granted a divorce from
James K. Yates, on the ground of deser
tion. They were married in 1877 and have !
six children. About five years ago, while i
living at Santa Cruz, Yates deserted his
wife and children, leaving them in a desti
tute condition.
The suit of Eva L. Pratt against George j
H. Pratt on the ground of desertion was
disposed of by granting the decree prayed
for. The Pratts were married in 1891. j
There were no children or community
property involved. V â : ""-.-.-
Lulu E. Hooper was denied a divorce i
from J. E. Hooper. In the complaint she
charged her husband with desertion. The j
testimony showed that the desertion did j
not occur until November, 1895, and a3 !
sufficient time had not elapsed to consti- \
tute desertion the decree was denied. |
They were married five years ago in Kan
sas, and have two children.
Bee Battis secured a separation from
Charles Battis, with whom she had lived
for twenty-five years, on the ground of de- I
sertion. About a year ago Battis tired of
his wife and deserted her and a 13-year
old boy. *. " -t Â..,;
. Eva G. Ballinger was divorced from
William Ballinger, and granted- $25 per
month alimony. | The charge was deser- I

ration from Jean Alva Cook, on the same I
charge, was granted. \ Cook was formerly |
a candy-manufacturer in this city, but de- 1
serted his wife and went to Los Angeles'
where he is now living.
The. submission and default of the de
fendant in tbe divorce suit of Catherine

CAPTURED AT SAX DIEGO. *
Chief of Police . Brenning Apprehend* a
Man Wanted in Wisconsin.
.. SAN DIEGO, Cal., . April 13.â Sheriff
Halvor Gunderson of La Crosse County,
Wis., arrived last night, and left for home
to-day with John Kupp, whom lie has
been seeking for some weeks. Kupp is
wanted in La Cross County for feloniously
receiving moneys as a banker. The details
of his alleged misdoings are not known
here. y)~.yyY l iYy .ly-yJiZ
Kupp came to Sa n Diego some weeks
ago with his family. He bought a little
cigar-store and ran that for a while, but
sold out and for some time has been doing
nothing. Chief of Police Brenning re
ceived a description of Kupp from Sheriff
Gunderson, and after a few days' search
located Kupp at Twenty-ninth street and
j National avenue. â "
Sheriff Gunderson was notified and he
came on, first procuring a warrant from
Governor Budd. Kupp was completely
unnerved when arrested and admitted
enough to show that he was the right
man. In fact, Sheriff Gunderson knew
and was surprised to learn that Kupp had
not changed his name or attempted to get
across the Mexican line. An hour after
Kupp was arrested he was taken aboard
the overland and was on his way to an
swer to the charge against him.
' Kupp's family is left here in apparently
reduced circumstances.

vor of such action on the part or the people

FIRE AT BAKERSFIELD.
Two Block* Comprising a Chinatown
Jfestroyeii.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., April 13.â New
Chinatown, two blocks of frame building,
in the southeastern part of town and en
tirely disconnected from the main por
tion, was entirely destroyed by fire early
this morning. The fire was started in a
stable by incendiaries and spread to every
part of the two blocks, burning as long a_
there was anything to burn. The loss is
about $20,000, with only $1100 insurance.
On account of the nature of the buildings
the insurance rate was 10 per cent, and
â¢ only one firm carried a policy.
The fire could have been easily extin
guished with* buckets when first started,
oiit the Chinese were panic-stricKen and
refused' to do anything to stay the pro
gress of the flames. Swarms of Mongols
got their meager belongings out of the
structures .and then calmly watched the
spread of the flames, when they could
readily have stopped their spread.

IN A FERMENT.
Old Animosities Aroused by
the Dawson Divorce
Scandal.
GENERAL CARR SCORED.
He Is Accused by Colonel Fife
of Having Manufactured
Testimony.
MILITIA FIGHT IS REOPENED.
The Taccman Ssys H s Enemy "_s De
faming a Woman to Settle a
Gru"gi.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 13.â The Daw
son divorce scandal is growing. A sensa
tion was caused to-day by a statement
made by Colonel Fife of Tacorna. a man
who stands high in State and military cir
ties. Fife's name was extensively men
tioned in an affidavit filed in the Dawson
case recently by Lottie Evans (now Mrs.
George P. Kinsey) of Los Angeles. It was
to the effect that Colonel Fife had one day
received Mrs. Dawson at Tacoma, taken
her to the insane asylum at Steilacooni for
a pleasure trip, and on their return -bowed
her a gnat many more courtesies and
took more privileges with her than was
proper for him to do.
Fife has just been apprised of the affida
vit, and in a public statement he says that
General Carr of this city, who is at the
head of the State militia and is a man high
in political and social circles in the city, is
trying to rum him. Carr is counsel for
Dr. Dawson and a personal friend of the
latter. Fife alleges that Carr has taken
advantage of an opportunity to injure
him in order to even up a personal matter
between them. Fife says: * *
"The inspiration of that affidavit, as far
as it refers to myself, is personal spite on
the part of General Carr, whom I regard
as my personal enemy. The cause of
General Carr's animosity and hatred of
me is a part of the trouble in the National
Guard, which is of long standing, but
which has in a measure died away since
Adjutant O'Brien was legislated out of
office. In the protracted and persistent
fight that was made on the late adjutant
general of the Washington National
Guard I had a part, and In the efforts I
made to have O'Brien romoved from the
office, and other steps I took in the inter
est of the State militia, 1 was bitterly op
posed by General (then colonel) Carr. It
was his friendship for O'Brien that led him
to work assiduously for his re-election
from time to time, and in this he fonnd
myself and my friends opposed to him.
In this way General Carr came to regard
me in the way he does, and I have heard
from various sources that he has ex
pressed a desire to do me up.
"I am not surprised at his attempt to
cover me with pitch by dragging my name
into this affair without the least warrant.
I have known Mrs. Dawson some time
and have always regarded her as a perfect
lady In every respect. She certainly con
ducted herself as such whenever in my
presence and I have every reason to think
highly of her. The story the Evans
woman tells about my meeting her and
Mrs. Dawson at the office of Captain How
ell is false in every particular. I never
saw Mrs. Dawson at his office and never
left Miss Evans in the office with Captain
Howell while I took a walk with Mrs.
Dawson. There was nothing in my asso
ciation with Mrs. Dawson that can in the
least manner be construed as not perfectly
proper and honorable.
"I remember the time Mrs. Dawson, ac
companied by her servant, came to the
hotel in the summer of 1834. They occu
pied room No. 1 at the Fife Hotel, and
there was nothing in the conduct of Mrs.
Dawson that was not ladylike during her
stay in the house. They expressed a de
sire to see the insane asylum at Steila
coom, and as I was a trustee of the hospi
tal at that time they wanted me to take
them out to the place. I did so, and as
we boarded the cable-car, it was merely a
chance that I saw Captain Howell in the
street and asked him to accompany us.
He did so. After returning to the city I
left them, asking the captain to accom
pany the ladies to their hotel. That was
the last I saw of them that evening.
"The story that, on another occasion, I
met Mrs. Dawson at the office of Captain
Howell and went out walking with her I
brand as a falsehood. lam thoroughly
satisfied that the affidavit was written in
the office of General Carr in Seattle and
sent to Mrs. Kinsey to sign."
The motion of Dr. Dawson for a modifi
cation of the order requiring him to pay
his wife SHOO in alimony came ud in the Su
perior Court to-day and was denied. Daw
son alleged that his wife was spending
money in order to get witnesses out of the
way, and referred particularly to the Los
Angeles witnesses. Dr. Dawson made affi
davit that he had letters in his possession
showing that Mrs. Dawson was trying to
get Lottie Evans out of the way, and be
lieves that she has succeeded. Judge
Humes found that there was no such proof
and denied the motion.
TRAGEDY NEAR AHWAHNEE
Rancher William McGusk Shot
and Killed by Richard
McGoon.
The Murderer a Former Asylum In
mate Who Was Believed to Be
Harmless.
MADERA, Cal., April 13.â A telegram
was received here Saturday night by
Sheriff West fall, stating that' William
McGusk had been shot and killed near
Ahwahnee by Richard McGoon. Themes
sage called for the Sheriff and Coroner
Payne to come tip at once. Both gentle
men left yesterday morning for the scene
of the shooting. Coroner Payne held au
inquest there yesterday afternoon or this
morning, but so far only meager partic
ulars have been received.
McGusk was out looking after cattle,
and rode up to McGoon 's cabin, which is
on a ranch known .as the old Crouch place,
a few miles from Ahwahnee. McGoon
was alone in his cabin, and when McGusk
rode up he stepped to the door with a
shotgun. Without a word of j warning :he
raised the gun to his shoulder and fired.
McGusk, who was at close range, dropped
dead. Word was sent to Constable Lara
more at Fresno Flats, and he hastened to
Ahwahnee and placed McGoon under
arrest.
Richard McGoon is a man about 45 years
of age and has lived in lhat country for a
number of years. Some years ago he lost
his reason and was taken to the insane
asylum at Stockton. He was confined
there about two years. It was believed
that he had recovered, so he was permitted
to go to his home in the mountains. Since
that time he has been noticed to act queer
ly and at times showed symptoms of the
return of the malady. He was not be
lieved to be at all dangerous, however, as
he always appeared harmless.
William McGusk, the murdered man,
Wi about 30 years old. He had lived in
the Whiterock district for a number of
years, owning many cattle. He bore the
reputation of being a quiet and peaceable
man. McGusk was a brother of "Jack"
McGusk, who was shot and seriously
wounded in a difficulty with W. H. Wells
near Madera a few years ago.
STATE FAIR FEATURES.
Agricultural Directors Decide Upon a Two
Weeks' Meeting Many Entries
in Prospect,
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 13.â The
regular April meeting of the State Board
of Agricultural Directors was held to-day.
Director Chase was re-elected president,
and the following State Fair committees
were appointed: Premium list â Land, Cox,
Delong, Matthews and Flickenger: speed
programme â Wilson, Terry, Boggs,
Mackey and Gird.
After considerable discussion it was
agreed that the time of the fair should be
extended one week, from September 1 to
19 inclusive. This move has long been the
pet scheme of Director Land, and means
an increase to the revenues of this city of
at least $100,000 outside money. As the
prospective entries at the track are far
more numerous than last year it is ex
pected that the speed programme will be
even better than in 1895.

To the Cycle Board of Trade of San Franciscoâ
Gentlemen: The Merchants' Association bids
your newly organized board greeting to the
| public-spirited work of securing improved
pavements, better roads and attractive boule-
I yards for the City and County of San Francisco.
Assurances of the encouragement and co
i Operation of the Merchants' Association in

j called upon the officers of this association.
The board of directors desires, furthermore,
to extend a cordial Invitation to the members
of your board to avail themselves of all the
privileges of the association, including the use
of its offices and library in tbe Mills building.
One of the cardinal principles of the Mer
chants' Association is the improvement of the
highway, of San Francisco. Correct drainage,
clean streets, noiseless pavements, adequate
illumination and beautiful boulevards are
among the most potent factors of municipal
progress. No city on earth has ever attained a
high degree of permanent prosperity without
these fundamental requisites.
It is most gratifying to witness the recent
awakening of the citizens of Sun Francisco to
the vital significance of these questions in the
i present and future welfare of our City. It re
j quires only the concerted action of the people
; to bring about these beneficent results and
â  our metropolis in the vanguard of the pro
gressive and prosperous cities of the world.

Death of Â»tii Old Ne^jro.
John Demby, an old colored man, for twenty
one years janitor in the Risdon Iron Work?,
dropped dead last evening at 6 o'clock, on tne
corner of Beale and Market streets. Demby
had just alighted from a Valencia-street car
when he reeled and fell to the sidewalk. He
was earned to the ironworks, where it was
found that he was dead. The Coroner was
notified and the body was removed to the
Morgue. The fact that Demby fell to the
ground Immediately after alighting from the
car led many to believe that a sudden lurch
had thrown the old man to Hie pavement and
caused his death. This is not believed to be a
fact; However, as no bruises were found on the
body and it is presumed that death resulted
from natural causes.

Gardens.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April 14.â 1t was
midnight before the last of the three spe
cial trains bearing the delegates to the
seventeenth annual convention of the
Hotel Men's Mutual Benefit Association
reached Los Angeles. They were due here
six hours earlier, but the snowstorm in
Arizona delayed them. A special train
containing the reception committee of the
Southern California Hotel Association left
LO3 A_geles Grande station at 7:30 o'clock
in the morning for Barstow to meet and
welcome the visitors. At Raymond bas
kets of flowers for the ladies and bouton
nieres for the men were received from the
Raymond gardens, and at Pasadena
streamers of smilax and flowers for deco
rating the cars were taken on.
The reception committee was made up
as follows: San Diegoâ George W. Lynch
and Miss Kendall; Los Angeles A. C.
Bilicke, _'. 0. Johnson and wife, Thomas
Pascoe, H. W. Chase and wife and Charles
H. Smith; Coronado â E. S. Babcock;

Stanton; Pasadenaâ H. Holmes, G.
Wharton James and Miss Farnsworth.
Representatives of the Southern California
Railroad Company and the Western Union
and Postal Telegraph companies, who ex
tended to the visitors the courtesies of
their respective lines, were also aboard the
train. The San Diego City Guard band
was taken along to discourse music.
A royal welcome was extended to the
400 excursionists, and the ride from
Barstow to thi3 city was exceedingly
pleasant after the tedious journey through
mountains and desert. Owing to the
deiay in arriving the reception at the
Westminister Hotel last evening had to be
abandoned. Most of the delegates will re
main in the cars until morning.
The programme for to-day includes the
opening of the convention at 10 a. m. and a
car ride about the city. At 1:15 p. m. the
visitors will come together on Judge
Silent' lawn, at the corner of Adams
and Figueroa streets, where an open air
lunch will be served. A carriage drive
through the city will follow, and a train
leaves at 6:30 p. m. for Santa Monica,
where a hop at the Hotel Arcadia will
round out the day's pleasure.
RECEIVED AT BARSTOW.
California Flowers Presented to the
Eastern Viaitora.
BARSTOW, Cal., April 13.â The Chi
cago hotel men's special left for Los An
geles at 9 o'clock. It carries a party 125
strong, with everybody well and happy.
It is a very heavy train, comprising the
Pullman sleepers Acestes, Anchises, So
crates, Zetes and Euripides, and two din
ing cars and a baggage van. The following
members of the reception committee ac
company it: A. C. Bilicke, Captain
Thomas Pascoe, S. Wharton James,
Charles Montgomery, Miss Kendall and
Miss Farnsworth, escorted by H. K.
Gregory, assistant general passenger agent
of the Southern California Railroad.
The second train, bearing members of
the Hotel Men's Mutual Benefit Associa
tion to Los Angeles, left at 11 o'clock,
after having been duly decorated with
flowers. The ladies and gentlemen aboard
were supplied with an abundance of the
fragrant blossoms. Simson Ford is cap
tain of the train, which is made up of bag
gage, buffet and dining cars, and the
palace sleepers, St. James, Horatio, Hun
gary, Columbine and Narcissus. Here
the train was placed in charge of the
following members of the reception com
mittee: E. 8. Babcock, Captain J. C. Kirk
patrick, J. H. Holmes, O. B. Stanton, Mrs.
E. J. Davis and Mr. and Mrs. H. W. Chase,
accompanied by Mr. Hibbard of the South
ern California road. This train is from
New York City and carries seventy people
âtwenty- seven ladies and forty-three gen
tlemen.
The third section of the excursion left
Barstow soon after the second. There are
eighty-four persons on the train, compris
ing the New England delegation, .with G.
H. Bowker as captain. The train consists
of three Wagner sleepersâ the Wild wood,
Tagus and Radcliff â and Wagner baggage,
buffet and dining cars.
At Barstow the reception committee's
car, San Vicente, was attached to the New
England train, and badges, souvenir itin
eraries and flowers were distributed
throughout the train.
A special car from Denver will probably
arrive to-morrow, and that party, together
â with those who previously came in, will
bring the number present up to 350.
The New England train came near meet
ing with disaster in the Raton pass. The
coupling between the engine and coaches
_arted and the train started to run back
down the grade, the automatic air brakes
failing to work. The hand brakes were
quickly applied, however, ana all danger
averted. : yyyy-',
BAY ASSOCIATION MEETS.
The Brown Investigating; Committee
Formally Files Its Report.
SAN LORENZO, Cal.. April 13.â The
Bay Association held its regular quarterly
meeting in the Christian "Union Church,
this city, to-day. With the exception of
Dr. McLean, Dr. Mooar, Dr. Pond, Rev.
H. H. Wikoff and Dr. CO. Brown, the
latter still claiming fellowship,! every
member of the association was present.
Rev. J. H. Strong of Sunol was elected
moderator and Rev. ;G. T. McCallom of
San Lorenzo scribe for the ensuing year.
Rev. W. 3d. y Tubb of San ' Francisco, the
retiring scribe, at the request of Mr. Mc-
Callom rilled that office to-day, however.
] The regular literary programme com
! menced with a well-timed paper on Jud
son's "Ministry of the Spirit," by Rev. O.
W. Lucas of the Fourth Congregational
Church. Oakland. . This was followed by
a" eloquent delivered by the Rev.
J. D. Foster of Lorin. .; r; .-
At the afternoon session Rev. A. K.
Crawford of Oakland delivered a learned
exegesis of Luke. Dr. W. D. Williams of
San Francisco submitted a report in regard
to Dr. Brown's case, saying that no decis
ion had been reached, which was unan
imously adopted. '
When the joint committee appointed at
the request of Dr. Brown ended its labors
in January last without securing a state
ment from the accused pastor it was given
out on what appeared to De good au
thority that the committee had been
utterly unable to get Brown to make an
explanation, except in his own peculiar
way. Dr. Williams was seen immediately
after the adjournment of the Bay Associa
tion and asked about the matter.
"Yes, it is true that Dr. Brown refused
to make a statement to the joint commit
tee, except in his own way," he said.
"Brown said he would only make an oral
explanation, but we insisted on his reduc
ing anything he cared to reveal to writing.
If we could have employed a stenographer
it would have been different. It is an easy
matter to say one thing now and three or
four months hence deny that he ever
said it. > -â¢
"The joint committee did not care to
take such chances, and so thought it best
to adjourn. Dr. Brown would probably
have fared better had he agreed to do as
we wished."
WILL MEET TO-DAY.
The Bay Conference to Go Into Ses
sion at BerkeleyâForeshad
owing the Proceeding's.
The Bay Conference will meet at Berke
ley to-day. Promptly at 1:30 o'clock Mod
erator McLean will rap for order, and then
the great Brown scandal will be gone over
again.
There is considerable diversity of opin
ion as to the strength Pastor Brown will
develop in the conference. It is generally
conceded that at least three of the San
Francisco members will support him.
Foster of Lorin is also known to be his
friend, and it is expected that other mem
bers from the country will come to his
rescue.
Dr. McLean of Oakland will lead the
fight against the convicted pastor. As a
prominent member of the conference ex
pressed it yesterday: "It is a struggle be
tween McLean and Brown, and it is not
thought possible that the latter can save*
himself with such an able antagonist to
deal with."
The Bulletin of last night contained a
letter from Franklin L. Lord, at present
living in Detroit, but formerly publisher
of a paper in Kalamazoo. Mr. Lord uses
rather vigorous language, saying that on
one occasion he called Brown a "willful
liar" and accused him of breaking one of
the statutes of Michigan. The trouble be
tween Lord and Brown grew out of an ar
ticle published in the paper conducted by
the former reflecting seriously on the char
acter of the minister.
AT THE CITY THEATERS.
Richard Mansfield Warmly Re-
ceived in "Beau BrummeU"
at the Baldwin.
Richard Mansfield made a nice choice by
opening his season at the Baldwin Thea
ter last night with "Beau Brnmmell." The
title role is about the most popular imper
sonation in Mansfield's repertory. As for
the play, one would willingly see it twice
or even thrice to enjoy the luxury of be
ing genuinely, touched and interested in a
way which Very few one-character plays
possess the power of moving and inter
esting. >*-s',b, : yj'"'
Mansfield's acting has lost none of its
power to charm. After the ranting and
declaiming of actors of the older school,
his quiet, natural, human characterization
of Beau Brummell comes with a sense of
infinite peace and truth. Mansfield's art
never tbr a moment flags from the first
scene, when the foppish leader of fashion
sits beiore his mirror, powder-puff in band,
till the supreme moment, when he falls
dead of slow starvation in his miserable
Calais lodging. Throughout the whole
performance there is not one strained
effect nor meretricious bit of play, nothing
that fails to confirm the theater-goers'
own observation of life. V- -' â¢
In "Beau Brummell" Mansfield shows
the gradual purifying and refining of a
character in the furnace of suffering. The
fop who turns with horror from a bill that
"smells of peppermint" finds he has a
heart and that tor the sake of the woman
he loves he can make sacrifices
and can suffer, even to death, in
silence rather than take advantage of
Mariana's generous spirit of unselfish
ness. The beau's affectation that
arouses laughter in the earlier scenes Is
tinged with touching pathos in the last act,
when the foppish sayings are used as a
veil to hide gaunt poverty. Through all
these complex expressions of feeling Mans
field manages to convey the' true inward
ness of the beau's mind and heart, with
out overstepping the limits of the ordinary
conventionalities of life. ."'â 'â¢:' b."--- -
The supporting > company has not
changed to any considerable extent. It
did its work last night in a thoroughly
satisfactory manner. Miss Jennie Eus
tice is a new-comer to the ranks of the
Mansfield troupe, and she played her part
of Mrs. St. Aubyn gracefully and easily,
with the added advantage of looking
charming. Miss Beatrice Cameron, who
played her old role of Mariana
Vincent, looks somewhat tired and worn.
She scarcely has an opportunity of show
ing her mettle in the character, but she
won considerable applause as well as flow
ers. The beau's valet was most ably
played by A. G. Andrews; W. N. Griffith
was good as Vincent and Joseph Weaver,
Orrin Johnson and Edmund Lyons were
all thoroughly at home in their parts.
The audience was a large and fashion
able one and it showed considerable en
thusiasm. Miss Johnstone Bennett was
good in the little role of the maid,' and
Mrs. Charles Gaylor was excellent as the
French lodging-house keeper.
The Grand Opera-House. y. â¢ .'
A very nervous, high-strung play is "Michael
Strogoff,".yet it is always a favorite. Its sen
sationalism is pure and legitimate, while its
openings for good acting and elaborate scenic
effects are many. The play, as presented at
the Grand Opera-house, is certainly worth see
ing. Uarreli Vinton makes the title role a
brilliant feature. Perhaps he has just a slight
tendency to rant, but as he has to speak for
the most part in a tone sufficiently loud to be
heard above the sound of shot and bursting
shells, some elevation of the voice is doubtless
the *.hing. Julia Blanc, as the hero's mother,
aids him most efficiently, her methods being
artistic and natural, that is, if one can judge
how a mother would act amid the dreadful
trials to which Strogoff's parent was subjected.
Eugene Moore, as Ivan Ogareff, a disgraced
Russian officer, traitor and thorough-going vil
lain, Fred Butler as the Czar, and Hugh Ward
and Charles W. Swain as the two newspaper
correspondents arc all good in their several
parts, while E. J. Holden, as the Tartar chief,
is quite the beau ideal of a barbarian despot.
Another exacting and well-sustained part is
that of fiangarre, the gypsy woman, to which
Miss Lisle Leigh- gives a very spirited and able
interpretation. â  : - â  ' â 'yYi-y'yy'y.yyy.
At the Alcazar.
. Josephine Gassman has a chance to shine in
the title role of. "Cad the; Tomboy," and she
shines beyond a doubt. A good house greeted
her last night, and though the play is a well
worn one it was well received. .; Leonard Gro
ver Jr. as Tom Ward, the gasman, and Leonard
Grover Sr. as the villain are both good, while
Gordon Foster as a park tramp makes a dar
ling hobo. May Noble as Emma Disbrow, the
adventuress,' makes her part a very strong one.
The other parts are, as a rule, well taken.
Since the ' "continuous show venture \ was
abandoned audiences at the Alcazar have been
growing steadily and indications point to
better times for "the Moresque home of the
drama, now that the variety performances
have finished once and for all. â :'â -.:.

THE KELLY-MAHONEY "PUSH."
It Will Have Free Bser and Full Swing
at Martin & Jerry's Rump Pri
mary To-Day.
There was vim in the preparations for
the Republican primary of to-morrow
which went forward yesterday at Repub
lican headquarters and in the eighteen
districts. , ;.. ,
At 1 o'clock to-morrow afternoon the
ballots which will show whom the Repub
lican voters of San Francisco want to rep
resent them in the selection of delegates to
the National convention will begin to fall
at the polling-places, and will continue to
fall until 7 p. m. Although nothing but
the selection of delegates to St.
Louis is to be the work of the
Congressional and State conventions on
May 5, the keen interest being taken by
all elements of the party promises that a
very heavy vote will be polled, while the
safeguards provided by the County Com
mittee, the policy which John D. Spreck
els has used every effort to enforce, and
the fact that reputable Republicans are in
control, guarantee that the election will be
a clean one, giving an equal show to all
elements and that the ballots will be hon
estly counted.
The list of election officers who will con
duct the election at the polling-places
named in the official election call pub
lished elsewhere in this paper was not
completed last night and will not be offi
cially announced until to-day. The
tickets which are being printed by the
County Committee will likewise be given
out to-day.
In a great majority of the districts all
elements in the party have agreed upon
one set of candidates. In four or five
districts rival tickets will be in the field
and the ones receiving the most votes
will appear to be the best tickets. There
will likely be contests in the Thirty-fourth,
Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth and * Thirty
seventh districts and possibly in one or
two others.
In no case has any opposition to the
leadership of John D. Spreckels arisen as
a cause of contest, and in all cases the
rival sets of candidates are equally friendly
to him and equally appreciative of the de
cency, fairness, honesty and ability shown
in his policy. The contests which will be
fought out at the polls to-morrow all con
cern district rivalries, and none are so bit
ter as to present the danger of any splits
in the ranks when the primary is over or
to create sores inimical to party interests.
The voters of the various districts are to
select convention delegates to-morrow.
Six, eight or nine delegates have not in all
cases been named to the satisfaction of
everybody. Some clubs, some active
workers, some old Republicans and some
young ones have felt here and there that
they have not received their proper share
of recognition or that they could name
better representatives of the district, and
so have put up sets of delegates of
their own. That is the situation
as to all the contests. In all these cases
the only hand which John D. Speckels has
taken has been to conciliate and harmon
ize as far as possible, by endeavoring to get
all elements to agree to a division of rep
resentation in the district delegation.
One of the active contests will be settled
at the Thirty-seventh district polls. There
the first tickets named bore the names of
A. J. Raisch, Fred Eggers, C. O. Burton,
James Alva Watt, J. H. Gray, J. E. Field,
George A. Wentworth and John Hegger.
Then an opposing element put in the
field the following ticket: P. B. Cornwall,
Dr. F. W. Harris, J. E. Field, Dr. R.
O'Connell, William G. Long, S. S. Morton,
Judge Waldheimer and E. L. Cook. The
friends of this ticket will hold a meeting at
Mowry's Hall this evening in its interest.
Judge M. Cooney, chairman of the Re
publican Executive Council, is interested
in the affairs of his district, and the expo
sition he gave last evening of the situation
in that district applies in a broad way to
most of the other contests. â 
. "The thirty-seventh district contest,"
he declared, "is purely a matter of senti
ment and lis not a fight against any
person. Both sides are supporters of Mr.
Spreckels and the contest is wholly a dis
trict affair. Those who have put the
second ticket in the field feel that there
are older Republicans in the district who
should have been placed on the ticket for
delegates to the State convention, and the
con test grows out of that, feeling. I have
been trying for two or thiee days with
others to bring about a compromise, but
to-day it appears to be a settled fact that
there will be two tickets.
"These . contests, however, only do good
in many cases. It is often impossible for
all, even among tends, to agree on the
same candidate, for so many have aspira
tions to participate in the affairs of the
party and go to conventions or have
friends whom they want to see successful in
that way. It brings out all elements of the
party, creates more interest in primary
elections and better results follow."
In the Fortieth District it appeared for a
time that County Committeraan Jesse
Marks and others had succeeded in har
monizing things to the satisfaction of
evetybody, but things have broken out
again and the Republican Executive Coun
cil Club has put in the field a rival ticket.
This contest, like the others, is wholly a
district matter. The club named met in
'Hamilton Hall last night with L. M. Allen
in the chair and indorsed the following
ticket: A. A. Brown, C. B. Sessions,
James Spanton, H. A. Callendar, Cor
nelius Holmes, S. C. Irving, M. A. Lee,
Archie Mackillop, R. â¢L. Thomas. -';,â  "
In the Thirty-fourth District, repre
sented in the County Committee by John
Jackson, the following ticket has been
nominated by the Republican Executive
Council Club: J. â >_*_.', C. -Hobbs, George
Welaer, S. L. Lent, Harry Beaslev, Henry
Buttner, Ed Smith, Cord . Wetjen, Ed
Eustace.
Kelly and Mahoney's rump primary in
the Fourth District will bring steam beer
this afternoon to the gang, which Martin
Kelly will herd from district to district.
Martin and Jerry are keeping up their
effort to break in somewhere and get hold
of something to trade/and lacking the
assistance of any proposition of the decent
element of the party they are depending
on the "'push" and on a vote as large as it
is thought proper and convenient to create
by stuffing. Martin Kelly's gang now
includes quite a large number of what
used to be known as "Buckley Repub
licans." bb yyy â 
However, few leading and active Repub
licans could be found about town yester
day who knew just when the Kelly-
Mahoney primary was to be held or who
had given it enough consideration to ena
ble them to express an opinion about it.
At Republican headquarters yesterday the
little side primary was seldom even
mentioned or inquired about, and the ar
rangements for the regular primary under
the auspices of the Republican County
Committee, which is being supported by
the mass of the party, and all of its active
and solid elements, have gone ahead with
a total ignoring of Martin Kelly and
Jerry Ma honey. '.[â ";â >â 'â 'â 'â .

Rosie Rendel added some good new char
acterizations to her dances. Segommer won
the usual amount of applause for his accom

B. KATCHINSKI,
PHILADELPHIA SHOE CO.,
10 Third Street. San Francisco.CAPTURED FOUR RACES
Horses From the Corrigan String
Enjoyed a Very Profitable
Outing.
RAIN INTERFERED WITH FORM
Major Cook Finished With the "Also
Goodwin II Eumrei
the Crowd Hard.
The heavy fog that enveloped the course
and obscured a view of the horses lifted
after the first race at ingleside had been
decided yesterday and the drizzling rain
and stiff sou'easter that followed consti
tuted about the nastiest racing weather
'experienced during the past wet season.
The downpour, however, was not suffi
ciently severe to make the going heavy
and fair time was made in the different
events.
The card was a good one and unmindful
of the dampness the "regulars" were out
in full force to fitness the sport. The
racers from the stable of Edward Corrigan
were very much in evidence during the
afternoon, the Hawthorne magnate's
colors being seen in front at the wire on
four different occasions. Horses from the
string of Burns & Waterhouse' carried off
the purses in the other twoevents decided.
The two-year-old Roselle and the con
sistent brown colt Kowalsky were the only
two winning favorites. Eddie Jones and
Slaughter divided the jockey honors.
With but 95 pounds in the saddle the
chances of Rosebud looked the most likely
of the five starters in the opening seven
furlong run, and the chestnut mare was
backed down from 8 to stoll to 10. She
was outfooted at the end by Olive, the sec
ond choice, packing the same weight, and
beaten cleverly at the wire by a length and
a half.
The seven starters in the maiden two
year-old event were a very ordinary lot.
Roselle, a colt by imp. Cyrus, was backed
down from evens to 7 to" 10, and, making

the running from the jump, won easily,
with the 4 to 1 outsider Viking second, a
neck before Modestia.
The Corrigan stable scored its second
win in a six-furlong selling affair that fol
lowed with the speedy Ottyanna. The
mare fairly revels in going that- has a
tendency to dampness, and the wise ones
got aboard at odds of "' to 1. She easily
shook her field off in the stretch and won
with great ease by four lengths. In a hard
drive the 3 to 5 choice, Goodwin 11, was
nosed out by Alvero, at S to 1 in the
betting.
The rapid traveling Mt. McGregor 11,
starting at odds of 2 to 1, captured the
fourth race of the day, a five and a half
furlong dash, in a hard drive with Moba
lasca. The pair locked horns in the
stretch, and in one of the best-contested
runs of the day Jones got the Burns &
Waterhouse entry past the wire first by a
neck. George Miller came very fast at the
end, lapping the leaders as they passed
the judges. The 3 to 2 favorite, Major
Cook, "also ran."
Unbacked by the stable, Mr. Corrigan s
filly Camelia upset calculations in the
mile and a sixteenth, decided under sell
ing conditions. Going to the post 4 to 1,
she was rated along behind old Dungar
ven until straightened away for the wire,
where she gradually forged to the front
and won with pounds to spare by a couple
of lengths. Dungarven. who wandered
back in the betting from 2 to 15 to 1, fin
ished second, with Pollock a distant third.
The 11 to 5 favorite Paros made a very poor
showing, finishing back in the ruck.
The books laid Â« to 5 against either Joe
Terry or KowalÂ«ky in the opening
betting on tbe last race of the day,
over a mile, but at post time Ko
walsky had the call. The pair ran
well together until less than a furlong
from home, when Kowalsky began poking
his nose in front, and in a drive gained the
verdict by a head. Unity was a poor
third, about eight lengths behind Terry.
Track and Paddock Items.
The race for gentlemen riders will be the
feature of to-day's card.
To-morrow, the closing day of the two
weeks' meeting, will be "ladies' day" at
Ingleside.
Judge Joe Murphy will leave for St.
Louis during the present week, where he
will officiate in the stand at the meeting to
be held in that city shortly. â â ', -yy;
Hidago, the black horse owned by
Jockey Jerry'Chorn, was reported to have
pulled up lame yesterday at the conclusion
of a gallop.
The Westchester stable's horses, in
charge of Trainer Ferguson, were shipped
to Cincinnati on Sunday. Tom Griffin's
colt, tir Vassar, left in the car with them.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 14. 1896.
Lovdal is : the latest acquisition to the
magnificent cripple division, it is said.
Jockey Felix Carr will leave for St. Lonis
on Wednesday. He expects to be able to
ride at 118 pounds the coming season.
The horses owned by Louis Ezell and
John Cochran will shipped to St. Louis
the close of the meeting now in progress.
The win of Cadmus on Saturday was so
gratifying to Mr. Spreckels that the presi
dent of the new jockey club presented
Trainer Galen Brown with $500/ and as a
mark of appreciation forMacklin's earnest
efforts gave the jockey $200 in addition to
the regular fee. Galen is certainly deserv
ing of great credit for the vastly improved
form shown by the game son of Flood
since under his charge.
The very capable trainer, FrankfTavlor,
left for E. J. Baldwin's Santa Anita ranch
yestarday to assume charge of the million
aire's string of racers, who will be fitted
for their engagements the coming sea
son by Mr. Taylor. As a mark of regret,
probably at the thought of losing his old
friend and trainer, Major. Cook, the 3 to 2
favorite for the fourth .event, ran a race
that would do credit to a lobster of the
first water. It is said B. C. Holly is now
training the gelding. If the judges had
called for the bookmakers' sheets and le *
the public know "how it happened," the
people who backed the sprinter would
have had a great burden lifted from their
minds. -Yl-'y
PREPARING FOR BONDS
First Official Step Taken to This
End on Behalf of the
Valley Road.
A Special Meeting Called for June 16,
to Consider an Issue of $6,000,000
Worth.
In the notice issued to the stockholders
of the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway yesterday to attend a
meeting on June 16 next, the first official
step was taken that will in all probability
lead to the issuance of $6,000,000 worth of
bonds to raise the money necessary to
complete the construction ot the road
from this City to Bakersneld.
At a joint meeting held last Tuesday be
tween the directors and trustees of the
company _ sub-committee was appointed
to devise the best plan for raising this
amount of money. This committee wa
to report to the directors and trustees in
joint session, who were then to decide
whether or not to present the matter for
mally to the notice and consideration of
the stockholders.
No meeting of this committee has yet
been held, and no definite plan has there
fore been yet decided upon to present to
the stockholders. As the statute, however,
requi res a sixty days' notice to the stock
holders when it is intended to issue bonds,
the following was make public yesterday:
Notice is hereby given, by order of the board
of directors of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railway Company, that a
meeting of the stockholders of said company
has been called by said board, to be held on
Tuesday, the 16th day of June, 1896, at 3
o'clock in the afternoon, at the principal place
of business of said company, at the building
where the said board of directors usually
meets, namely: at the office of said company,
No. 321 Market street, in the City and County
of San Francisco, in the State of California;
thatthe object of said meeting is to consider
and act upon the proposition that said com
pany create a bonded indebtedness of six mil
lion dollars ($6,000,000) in gold coin of
the United States for the purpose of
raising money to complete " the con
struction and equipment ot the rail
road of this corporation from the City and
County of San Francisco to the town of Bakers
field, in the county of Kern, State of Califor
nia, and to purchase and pay for any other
property within the purposes of said company,
and to secure the bonded indebtedness so pro
posed to be created by. a mortgage or trust
deed upon the railroad and railroad lines and
other property of said company now owned or
hereafter to be acquired by said company.
By order of the board of directors of the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway
Company. . v. y
[Corporate seal.] Alexander Mackie,
Secretary of the San Francisco and San Joa
quin Valley Railway Company.'
This action will permit of promptly car
rying out the designs of the directors,
should a bond issue be decided upon, as no
unnecessary time will be wastea after the
decision is made, which it is expected will
be the case in the next two months.
As previously stated in these columns
this $6,000,000 is to be used for building the
sections between San Francisco and Stock
ton ana between Fresno ana Bakersiield.
The former, it is estimated, will cost
$2,500,000 and the latter $3,500,000. The
Stockton-Bakersfield link, it is understood,
is to be given the preference when the new
construction work begins.
Only six assessments, of 10 per cent each,
have been made on the $2,500,000 stock
issued, and the remaining 40 per cent will
be sufficient to complete the work on the
Stockton-Fresno section.
FISTIC HEROES.
Olympic Tournament Boxers â The
Choynski and Sharkey Contest.
How the Betting Runs.
The Olympic Club has at last decided
upon a series of professional boxing con
tests for its May exhibition at the Pavilion,
which should give universal satisfaction.
The amateur programme has been
omitted, ana the following professional
boxers will appear in short bouts: Dal
Hawkins and J. McGinley will meet in a
six-round contest. They will be followed
by George Green and O. Ziegler in a ten
round contest, and as a fitting termination
to what promises to be a first-class even
ing's entertainment the well-known heavy
weight boxers, Professor Van Buskirk of
the Olympic Club and Professor John Mil
ler of the San FranciscolAthletic Club will
meet in a six-round bout, which gives
every promise of being a rattling set-to.
The betting on the Choynski-Sharkey
contest, which will take place Thursday
evening at the People's Palace Theater,
has commenced. Notwithstanding that a
number of old sports predicted a walkover
for Choynski the betting shows that Shar
key is well up in the race. Choynski is a
favorite, but the friends of Sharkey have
been snapping up all even bets offered that
Choynski will knock him out inside of
eight rounds. If the seaman can remain
on deck until the end of the fourth round
he will stand an excellent chance of re
taining his senses when the gong will
sound the end of the mill.

one of the ablest men in the list of Gov
ernors of the Hawkeye State, and widely
known because of his personal integrity
and the intelligence of his administration,
is at the Occidental. The Governor's home
is at Clermont, in his State.
He is on a pleasure tour of the Coast and
is accompanied by Mrs. Larabee and their
two daughters, Misses Annie and Helen
Larabee. They came by way of the South
ern Pacific and have been spending a little
time at Pasadena, Riverside, Los Angeles
and other places. Governor Larabee and
William Larabee, the Distinguished ex-Governor of lowa, Who Is Here With His
Family. ;
[Sketched from life by a ."Call" artist.] .
his family met many of their old lowa
friends in Southern California, among
them ex-Governor Merrill, who lives at
Los Angeles.
Colonel John P. Irish was among the
early callers on the Governor yesterday.
They were great frienUs in lowa, though
they were of different political parties,
and the Colonel called to pay his respects.
Mr. Larabee was the last Republican
Governor before Horace Boies. He has
for many years been a very influential
man. He is of the belief that United
States Senator W. B. Allison of lowa is
the best man that has thu_|far been named
for the Republican nomination for Presi
dent. b^.bbb'
"I understand there are a good many
McKinley men in California," said he,
"but we think we have a man who is in
every way an excellent one for the high
office, and we are sincerely desirous of his
nomination.
"In lowa everybody is for him ; that is,
all the Republicans are. Indeed, most of
the Democrats are, too, and he would poll
many a vote outside of his party.
"We are in favor of Senator Allison be
cause of his long experience, sound Re
publicanism and general conservatism.
He would, in my judgment, be a safe, pro
gressive man, and would reflect honor on
the nomination. He is something of a
bimetallist, I believe, and was a member
of i he commission a few years ago.
"He has been a resident of the State for
forty years and has been thoroughly tried.
As I said before, the people there i are all
for him. ;T>.'< yyi :._*â¢
"No, we really, I think, don't know
what hard times are in lowa. The people
there are going along quietly and prosper
ously. There have been big yields of corn
and other crops and there is nothing to
complain of in any way."
Governor Larabee was in California for a
short time four yearn ago. He will go
north by the Shasta route and then home
by the Canadian Pacific.
En route he will stop briefly at Ashland,
Portland, Tacoma; Seattle, Fairhaven,
Victoria and Vancouver. The gentleman
is of medium height, heavily built and
with strong features. His hair is almost
black and he appears to be about 50 years
of age. He and his family are enjoying
themselves in the highest degree on their
California trip. "V." ''*.'""".'â¢ -". ' >'-'>y --
MISSION ENCHANTMENTS.
Memorial Park, . High School, Kloctrlc
Boads and Beautiful Boulevards.
In casting about for an appropriate name
for the plsasure ground which will add to
the enchantments of the Mission that of
Memorial Park has been suggested. Mis
sion prospects are brightening. The High
School, the park and the boulevards are
assured. ' _. :-.<-/.â .â ' y- >y, â â ,
While Dolores-street boulevard is merely
prospective Folsom-street boulevard is an
assured fact, as work has already begun
on that thoroughfare. President "T. W.
McDonald of the City Improvement Com
pany has put a gang of men to work in re
moving the cobble-stones in the two blocks
between Fifteenth and Seventeenth streets.
' This is all that McDonald's men can do
until the Market-street Railroad people
put down the ; electric j tracK, which 'they
propose to do at once, much to the gratifi
cation of A. B. Maguire, the president of
the Folsom-street Boulevard Ciub. - y '
Out on" the Mission , roaa/and;,inbthe
Fairmount section nothing less 'than ; a
police station and a fire engine house will
satisfy the people. These they demand
for their protection against fires anddis
ordeily persons. . '
.Speaking of the construction of the Fol
som-street, road, H. H. Lynch said yester
day: "1 could do the work required in
two weeks, but I hardly think the corn
pany desires to rush things. In a month's
time the required power to move rolling
stock will be available, and then there will
be no halting in the work when it is once
begun." ' ;--, - _ '__' â¢_ ' Â ..'
SUNDAY COURSING.
Results of the Stake at the Ocean
View and Newark Farks
' .y YY;- Yesterday.
Two interesting coursing meetings were ;
held Sunday, one at Ocean View and the
other at Newark. At the former resort
two stakes were run to a finish, Cottage
Boy winning the regular stake after a short
run with Magpie, in which, the latter lost
by the veriest fluke after overshooting his
hare by several ; yards. Lucky Dog took
third and Ben fourth. â 
The consolation went to Captain Morse,
who beat Electric handily in the final.
At Newark, the meeting of the Interstate
Coursing Club brought out a large crowd.
Flying Buck won the first prize, San
Joaquin the second and Nellie Conroy the
third. The grass was rather long for good
coursing, but the crowd had an enjoyable
day. . - Â 'yj-y
A twenty-four-dog stake at $1 50 entrance
will be decided at Ocean View on Sunday
next.
It Was Dynamite.
Baji Marini iis a scavenger living at 15
Boardman place. Yesterday afternoon he
found a sharp-pointed stick with a brass end
in a heap of refuse and he thought he would
use it to make a hole in the handle of a fork.
He struck it with a hammer and a terrible ex
plosion followed. It was a stick of dynamite
and Marini's right hand was badly shattered
by the explosion. At the Receiving Hospital
Dr. Fitzgibbon amputated nis thumb and two
fingers. â¢ â  ;
POOLROOMS STILL OPEN
The Recent Wallace Decision
Had but a Temporary
Effect.
C. J. O'Donneil Had His Cases Dis
missed, Although Flagrantly
Defying the Law.
Some of the poolrooms do not seem at
all abashed by the recent decision of Judge
Wallace and are selling pools at their old
stands as openly as ever.
At the time that the case of Jerry Dris
coll was in Judge Wallace's court C. J.
O'Donneil, Henry Schwartz, Harry Cor
bett, Charles Kingsley and about twenty
others were arrested for violating the El
lert ordinance. They all pleaded guilty
and their cases went over until the deci
sion in the Driscoll case was rendered en
the understanding that if tho conviction
was sustained they would close their
rooms and a light fine would be imposed.
"When the decision was handed down most
of the poolroom men retired from busi
ness and Henry Corbett, Charles Kin.sley,
Jerry Driscoll and others on April 4 ap
peared before Judge Joachimsen and a
fine of $5 was imposed upon them.
' C. J. O'Donneil had two charges against
him and his cases were continued till April
10, as he had not gone out of the business,
although he was one of those who pleaded
guilty and * undertook to close his rooms
if the Wallace decision was adverse to the
poolroom men.
On April 10 he was ordered to appear for
sentence next day, when, to the amaze
ment of the poolroom men, - the cases
against O'Donneil were dismissed. In
view of the fact that O'Donneil is and has
been conducting a .. pool business in his
rooms on , Leidesdorff street, and thus
openly defying the law, the action of the
Judge in dismissing the cases against him
is peculiar and has caused a good deal of
unfavorable comment. â .â â ';â 
Â A. few days ago Judge Low convicted
Several poolroom men, who had been
sending the money by 'the Postal Tele
graph Company to San Jose, in order to
evade liability under the ordinance, but
they were only fined $20 each. . The full
penalty will probably be inflicted, as a
light fine of $20 has been shown to have
no effect upon tbe poolroom men who per
sist in violating the law. 7
Fought for the Balloon.
Seven belligerent residents of the Mission
with an eye to business took possession of the
balloon that fell near Sixteenth street Sun
day afternoon and started with it for the park,
threatening to exterminate the three luckless
men that had been hired by the , aeronaut to
recover his property after his parachute leap.
â *â â  With, stones and* clubs â¢ they defended their
capture, and a policeman who interfered soon
acknowledged his helplessness' and left the
discomfited three to follow at a safe distance
all the way to the chutes. 'â¢- <
The men failed to get their expected reward,
and went away vowing that the next time
that balloon falls in the Mission they will
make it useless even for patchwork. '"_
Some parents, eager to see the conclusion of
the log-rolling contest in the : afternoon,
rushed from their seats in the. pavilion, leav
ing their infant and unfinished glasses on a
table, with tne result that there was almost
immediately* thereafter more excitement on
the floor than on the little lake, for the child
overturned the table.
In 1874 a church mission was established
for the benefit of the deaf mutes of the
United States-
NO LAW FOR LOTTERIES.
Supreme Court Decision Lets the
Evil Thrive in San
Francisco.
NO CRIME TO HAVE TICKETS.
So Chinese Lotteries Are Booming All
Over Townâ Faulty
Ordinances.
Chinese lotteries are now running in
San Francisco on a more extended scale
than ever before, and agents for the gam
bling concerns are plying their trade
openly without fear of police or courts.
Such a radical change has been brought
about by a recent decision of the Supreme
Court of California under which it is now
no crime to be caught with tottery tickets
in one's possession. Lottery ticket agents
and dealers may carry on their business as
if it were a legitimate branch of trade, and
there is no law to punish them.
- A test case was made in 'Los Angeles by
the attorneys of Ah Ling, a Chinese, ar
rested for an alleged violation of the lot
tery ordinaire. Ah Ling had been an
agent for Chinese lotteries ana when the
police arrested him he had several tickets
in hi 3 spacious pockets. He was tried and
convicted. An appeal was taken to the
Supreme Court of California with the re
sult the defendant was acquitted. A
clause in the ordinance which read, "Un
less said possession snail be shown to be
innocent or for a lawful purpose," settled
the question.
According to t he ordinance it was a
clear case of placing the burden of proof
on the defendant, and that of course was
contrary to all principles of law and jus
tice. â  '.;.-. yy &
The San Francisco lottery ordinance is
the same as the Los Angeles one, and has
the same identical clause at the end. So
the decision has been quoted in the local
Police courts with the effect of compelling
prosecuting officers to dismiss Chinese ac
cused of having lottery tickets in their pos
session. The Chinese were not slow to
take advantage of the situation, for they
are already opening lotteries and pushing
the sale of tickets in every conceivable part
of the City. No place, it seems, is secure
from the importunities of those agents.
Even the home is invaded, and schools,
while no business house, office or store is
forgotten.
John T. Dare, prosecuting attorney of
Police Court 3, declares that there can
be no remedy for the knocked-out ordi
nance until the Legislature meets. Mean
while the evil is destined to spread and
thrive in all grades of society where the
spirit of gam bling exists.
"We are compelled to dismiss Chinese
charged with having lottery tickets," he
said. "We have to show that the man
was actually caught making the tickets or
participating in a lottery before one can
hope for a conviction. Hence the ! bold
ness of the Chinese. The Chinese lotteries
are multiplying daily and their agents are
bolder than ever. These fellows are now
extending their operations to private
families. Chinese vegetable and fancy
goods peddlers find access to the houses
and sell tickets to the servant girls and
children. Many barber-shops have the
tickets on sale and then again Chinese
servants, attendents in bathhouses and
laundrymen are agents.
. "A great many people are selling lottery
tickets, both of the Chinese and American
class. It is common now for a woman to
visit your house and canvass for a book.
After a short conversation she will inci
dentally speak about lotteries and then
use her persuasive powers to sell tickets.
The hazard spirit appears to be growing
fast in San Francisco, and the rising gen
eration is being educated un to it on all
sides, while all manner of obstacles are
thrown in the way to defeat the ends of
justice."
"Can you suggest a remedy ?" .
"1 don't think we can do anything till
the Legislature meets. The Board of
Supervisors cannot make an ordinance any
stronger than the one we have. This
clause nullifies it.. The police are doing
everything in their power to stop the traf
fic, but it seems utterly impossible to con
vict a Chinese.
"T tie criminal element is taking ad
vantage of this Supreme Court decision on
tnis clause of the lottery ordinance to
make it apply to the ordinances relating
to carrying burglar tools and concealed
weapons. The same clause appears in
each ordinance, so that the claim is made
that a man cannot, be convicted of carry
ing burglar's tools. The burden of proof
according to the ordinance would rest on
him. The same applies to the charge of
carrying concealed weapons. A test case
may be made to try if the Supreme Court
will not look upon these ordinances as it
has'done with the lottery ordinance."
GOT DRUNK TOGETHER.
Keeper Bury of the Agnews Asylum
and an Inmate Have a Good Time
in the City.
J. M. Bury, one of the keepers at the
Agnews Insane Asylum, came to the city
on Saturday night with Frank L. Fiffer,
one of the inmates. Fiffer had been al
lowed to pay a visit to his friends, who
live at Black Point.
About 11:30 o'clock Saturday night Fiffer
was arrested in a saloon on Pacific street
by Policeman Cavanaghand Special Officer
M. Sullivan. He was very drunk, and his
face was bleeding from several cuts. Bury
was with him and accompanied him to the
California-street police station. He was
not sober, and his mouth was bleeding.
When he said he was an official at the
insane asylum and that Fiffer was one of
! the inmates the officers at the station did
not believe him, and threatened to lock
him up unless he left, which he did.
'When Fiffer, who had been taken to the
City Prison, awoke Sunday morning he
complained that he had been robbed on
Saturday night of his watch and chain.
He said he and Bury had a good time, and
the only thing he regretted was losing his
watch. ''-'.Yyy'y
Sunday afternoon Bury called at the
City Prison, and Captain Lees gave him
permission to take Fiffer away with him.
TO BROADEN SOCIALISM.
Morrison I. Swift. Points the Way to
Establish One Great
Party.
Morrison I. Swift of Berkeley lectured
to the local socialists Sunday night at 26
O'Farrell street.
He blamed the socialists for the narrow
inefficiency of their past policy in abusing
those that have not seen the fairness and
broadness of socialism. He urged that no
party should be forced to assume the de
fensive because of attacks, but that social
ists should go to the different parties and
explain socialism to them ana encourage
the thoughtful, 'who would of necessity be
convinced of the merits of the principles;
to unite in forming a broad socialist party,
that; the lecturer predicts, will start with
the: present socialists unattached to any
party; be strengthened, by the socialisti
cally inclined â¢of the Labor party, and of
the People's party, and, after absorbing
the minor parties, be ready to include the
Republicans and Democrats, two politics
that he declares are doomed to break, as
'was the case in England, on the capital
and labor questions. -,
y . Socialism I should not.be a class move
ment and dissipate its strength. It can
not be identified with any organization or
or with many organizations; it is for man. i

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Prepare to-day for tbe primaries to
morrow.
Every April shower in the East this year
seems to be a blizzard.
_
Politics was slightly dull last week, but
in this one it promises to be lively.
Rainey may have been a small potato to
Buckley once but he is dictator now.
Republican loyalty is no lamb, but there
are lots of political wolves that try to wear
its clothing.
It will take something more than soft
solder to mend the split in the "Democratic
pot this time.
The deeper you dig in California the
more gold you find. This is no plated
commonwealth.
Colonel Robert Ingersoll's idea of what
a church ought to be would make a pretty
good variety show.
Don't forget to post yourself on local
politics so that you can vote right at the
Republican primaries.
There is a chance for California to have
a Cabinet officer in the next administra
tion if she works for it.
The mining counties have no boom in
the air, but they are finding something
very much like one in the ground.
Nobody is going to the St. Louis conven
tion in war taint, and no one is going to
the Chicago convention in any other way. !
The Senate will to-morrow debate the
question of investigating the bond deals,
and we may expect hot talk and plenty
of it.
As the Spaniards have carried the Cuban
elections it seems that General Weyler
knows how to win a victory at the polls at
any rate.
Democratic candidates for tbe Presidency
are becoming as thick as huckleberries in
June, and most of them are just about
that size.
If the Eastern welcome to Vamagata be
comes much more enthusiastic he may be
tempted to settle down over there and try
to run for President.
There seems to be nobody to join issue
with the protectionists this year, but
nevertheless protection is the issue on
which the people are joined.
There should be no dispute of the propo
sition that the California delegation at St.
Louis should see to it that California inter
ests are not lost in the shuffle.
â¢
It is now asserted the British expedition
has gone up the Nile for.no other purpose
than to help Italy drop Kassala without
dropping it into the hands of France.
There will be no use for New York Dem
ocrats to try to work up a Presidential
boom for ex-Governor Flower unless they
can give assurances that he's a daisy.
The gold men and the silver men in the
Democratic party are perfectly willing to
separate, but each wishes to ride away in
the party band wagon and leave the other
fellows to walk.
â Â» -
The illness of Senator Morgan prevents
him from taKing the lead in the fight
against the funding bill, and the wav is
therefore open for the California Senators
to distinguish themselves.
If there should be nothing new under
the sun this spring it will not be the fault
of the fiesta managers, for all of them are
wrinkling their brows daily in an effort to
get new wrinkles for their festivals.
â¢â
The success attained by the Olympic
games at Athens could probably be re
peated at San Francisco if the festival
were undertaken on a similar scale and
made a great holiday for the Pacific Coast.
The storm that burst over Depew when
he said he had seen no pretty women in
California evidently made him take to the
woods, for since his return to New York
he is quoted as saying that our woods are
full of them.
It was a foolish fellow who started the
report that Quay ha i withdrawn from the
Presidential race. This is not a year when
Republicans withdraw from anything.
Harrison is seemingly an exception to the
rule, but then he had a honeymoon in
sight. '_ y- ',
__ _ â _
Gorman thinks the Postmaster-General
should attend to his business in Washing
ton instead of running around the coun
try making speeches on the tariff and gold
money, but the chances are the making of
such speeches is exactly the ,. business
Cleveland Appointed him to perform. '
The assertion. of Senator Mantle that
without the advantages of bimetallism a
protective tariff cannot sufficiently guard
against the competition that is coming
from China and Japan contains a truth
which Eastern protectionists will find out
to their cost if they do not recognize it in
time to profit by it.
The bill for the admission of New Mex
ico to statehood should be pressed upon
Congress at this session with ail the force
the West can muster. It is time that this
section of the Union had it 3 rightful rank
and influence in the Senate. The gold
bugs should not be permitted to check the
development of a new State simply be
cause its people favor the remonetization
of silver.
KEPTJBLICAN PEIMAKIES.
All loyal Republicans should bear in
mind that the primary elections of the
party in this City are to be . held on
Wednesday, as is duly advertised in The
Call. There is to be a pretense of such
elections held in the 'Fourth District to
day. This pretense is managed by mal
contents and cannot possibly cut any fig
ure in. the regular administration of the
party. It is well that all Republicans
should be warned of this fact, in order
that they may make no mistake.
The so-called primaries of to-day will be
a cut-and-dried affair, signifying nothing.
It will not avail an intelligent and loyal
Republican anything to go near them or
to countenance them in any way. Tne
true primaries take place to-morrow. No
member of the party should allow himself
to be deceived in this matter. Stay at
home to-day, study the situation and vote
right to-morrow.
A CABINET POSITION.
The suggestion recently made by Sena
tor Perkins that there is a good prospect
for California to obtain in the next admin
istration a Cabinet office is one which de
serves the most careful consideration of
all Republicans. There can be no question
that the interests of the State and
the Coast would be greatly advanced
If a Caiifornian should be called to
the Cabinet. However strong may be our
delegation in Congress at any time the
simple fact that it may rarely or never be
representative of a single party, and that
possibly it may not be in political sympathy
with the President, lessens its efficiency in
comparison with that of a Cabinet posi
tion. Moreover, as Congressmen are
elected by districts, each will naturally
care more for the interests of his constitu
ents than for those of other Congressmen,
and hence the likelihood of perfect har
mony of action is always remote. Expe
rience has shown us that it is not to be
expected.
A Cabinet officer occupies an entirely
different position. lie is the personal
choice of the President and occupies the
i position of confidential friend and adviser.
| He is not a product of capricious and often
| ill-advised political selection. He is in
! constant official and social touch with the
I President and helps to constitute the inner
! working force of the Government. In a
Nation whose chief officer has greater
! power than any crowned head of Europe,
j except possibly the Czar of Russia, a con
fidential adviser of the President and bead
of one of the great executive departments
| of the Government is in a position to exer
i cisc enormous power.
Senator Perkins has indicated the
j means by which the Republican party of
California can hope to secure so valuable a
prize* ,ybat is to send an unpledged dele
gation to the National Convention. It
stands to reason that in the defeat of any
, Presidential candidate to which a. State
delegation is pledged that State cannot
hope to secure a Cabinet position, and we
all know how uncertain is the nomination
\of any particular candidate. With an
i unpledged delegation California would be
| in a commanding position. A Caiifornian
; in the Cabinet would mean a friend on
! guard for the entire coast.
The use of extraordinary care 5s re
quired to secure a proper understanding of
Western conditions among the millions of
Eastern people who know and care noth
ing about this region. Recent occurrences
have furnished us with abundant evidence
that California, neither for its own -sake
nor that of the country at large, through
a fair recognition of our needs, occupies
any appreciable share of Eastern atten
tion. We are too remote for our necessi
ties to urge themselves unaided. An in
telligent and earnest Caiifornian in the
Cabinet would make all the difference.
This consideration has a special signifi
cance for Republicans since a Republican
President will undoubtedly be elected.
Our peculiar and valuable industries need
protection, our coast needs defenses and
our rivers and harbors should be improved.
ALASKA'S GOLDEN MECCA.
All accounts relative to the new placer
mines in the vicinity of Cooks Inlet agree
that there is gold to be found there in pay-
ing quantities. No extraordinary finds
have as yet been reported, as was the case
when the placer diggings of California
were first invaded by the army of fortune
seekers. Yet the reports from the north
have been of so favorable character that
thousands have already taken passage this
season from various points on this coast
for the promised land of easily gotten
wealth. '-;'"'
Most of these embryo miners are young
or middle-aged men out of employment
for the time being, with perhaps just
enough savings to pay their passage to the
desired goal and to purchase a "crude out
fit with which to wash out â  the golden
flakes from the beds of the Alaskan creeks
flowing into Turnagain Bay. Should their
early efforts prove successful, no hard
ships will result, but should | fortune not
smile upon them they are likely to fare
hard.
The early experiences of the gold-hunt
ers of California were sufficiently trying
and made up of sufferings without severe
climatic conditions to contend with, and
the California argonauts were also favored
by having a large base of supplies in San
Francisco at a comparatively convenient
distance. While it is claimed that the
climatic peculiarities of the Cooks Inlet
country are similar to those of places in
40 degrees north latitude in this country it
is admitted that the formation of ice in
the winter precludes all possibility of
working the placer beds for seven months
of the year, and supplies are not so plenti
ful or near but great hardships might en
sue from an influx of people not properly
equipped and supplied.
It would, therefore, be wise for every one
who goes to the new gold fields to lay in
at least a year's supplies or take sufficient
funds along to carry him through until
the opening of the next season. If this is
not done great hardships are inevitable.
A GOOD EXAMPLE.
The strong desire of President Jordan of
Stanford University to extend the use
fulness of that institution has met with
praiseworthy appreciation at the hands of
Timothy Hopkins. This gentleman has
offered to bear the expense of sending two
of Stanford's bright young students to
Kamchatka on a scientific expedition
which will add to the renown of the uni
versity and to the general cause of human
knowledge. 1 Mr. Hopkins has not been in
the public eye of late. So far as external
indications are instructive he appears, to
have been content to grow the most eor
geous flowers that are" sold jin San Fran
cisco. Though a millionaire he does not
rank with the wealthiest men in the State,
and that fact makes all the more conspic
uous and admirable his generous assist
ance of Stanford University. b
It affords The Call a special pleasure to
record and praise actions like this on the
part of Californians possessed of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1896.
means to make their public spirit effective.
Much handsome work of this kind has
been done, but much still awaits the do
ing. The names of Stanford, Lick, Wil
merding, Sutro and others have passed
into the permanent history of the State by
reason of generous gifts to the people.
Others, like Ciaus Spreckels, deserve equal
praise for investments and improvements
on a splendid scale that insure the pros
perity and establish the fame of the State,
but the number of such citizens is small in
proportion to the number of millionaires
who have made their fortunes here. The
aspirations of some have been checked by
a malicious and irresponsible journalistic
sneer here or there, and that has been a
misfortune. There is an old story of a
millionaire, now dead, whose pur
pose to establish a great _rt school
was killed by an insulting paragraph
referring to his ignorance of artistic mat
ters. Responsible San Francisco, journal
ism has outgrown that folly. Ir is now
well understood that a millionaire, not
groveling in his hoard but spending it
wisely for the public good, either in bene
factions or great industries, will find the
people eager with evidences of apprecia
tion. The only trouble is that too few
millionaires seem to realize the new and
nobler order of things.
Instead of that some of them find Cali
fornia a bore and tolerate it only because
it is a generous nourisher of their purses.
A few of the richly dowered daughters of
fathers who have dug their treasure from
California's resources are better pleased to
marry impoverished Europeans of title
than the sturdy, manly and chivalrous
lads born on this soil and strong with its
vigor and hopefulness. It is no consola
tion that wretchedness commonly follows
these unions; there is all the more pity
for that. Besides these hapless girls there
are rich men who find distant countries
more congenial to their tastes and more
eager for their money than this most
richly blessed of ail the corners of the
earth. With them California is merely a
machine for the turning out of money.
The pleasure of living in a place so genial
and kind and with a people so generous
and responsive falls before the shrewdness
and greed of a civilization that depends
upon the allurements of glittering exter
nals. With such of our citizens as this it
is more congenial to be birds for easy Eu
ropean plucking than princes and bene
factors in the land of their birth. It is for
this reason that The Call enjoys an emi
nent satisfaction in recording a public
spirited act on the part of a California
millionaire.
IDEAL COLONIZATION.
The colonization of California would be
a problem of easy solution if the methods
which are being pursued by William
Smythe, president of the National Colo
nial Society, were generally adopted in
place of the loose and unreliable methods
heretofore employed. â / A general outline
of his plan of procedure is as follows:
In the first place, he secured the co
operation of a number of practical \ philan
thropists in various â¢ Eastern', cities, and
through them organized the National
Colonial' Society. Branches of these
called colonial clubs were organized in
various Eastern cities, the purpose of the
central and branch organizations being to
furnish reliable information to all who
should desire to settle in colony in Cali
fornia.
Mr. Smythe was the active agent in the
formation of these clubs, the membership
of which was composed of persons who
desired information concerning California
with the ultimate intention of settling in
tbis State should the conditions prove in
viting.
The first "practical result of this move
ment has been secured. At the solicita
tion of Mr. Smythe, the clubs of Chicago,
New York and Central Massachusetts
selected ten of their number to make a
visit of inspection to California, in order
to ascertain the exact nature of the con
ditions existing here. Their expenses
were borne by the clubs. They came by
way of the Canadian Pacific, and made a
thorough examination of the entire coast
from British Columbia to the Mexican
line. Their particular destination was a
colony tract in Tehama County, Cali
fornia, but they arrived at no decision
until they had thoroughly studied the
whole slope.
They had authority from their clubs to
make a decision binding their clubs, and
they were so well pleased with what they
found in Tehama County that they closed
a trade for 5000 acres of land, selected
townsites and orchard-tracts for them
selves and for 134 other members of the
clubs who had individually authorized
them to do so if their judgment war
ranted. Then they immediately organ
ized the colony on an . exceptionally
admirable plan of co-operation already
adopted by the clubs, and made prepara
tions for the immediate building of homes.
Thus every element of uncertainty and
every possibility of fraud is removed. As
the conditions here are stiange to Eastern
farmers the clubs secured the services of
Professor flilgard to make a thorough
study and report of the tract in question.
All, other questions, including climate,
water, fuel, transportation, value of land,
accessibility of market and healthfulness
of the region, were thoroughly | inquired
into by the committee and a highly favor
able report made concerning them all.
This is only the first of an unlimited
number of colonies which it is proposed to
found in California under the system. The
plan recommends itself for adoption by
all who realize the great importance of
, settling colonies in California.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
One of the notable venders of different arti
cles in San Francisco, and who may be seen not
only in the hotels, but along the principal
thoroughfares, is a young women with raven
black hair and eyes so dark that any observer
knows her forefathers must have lived for
many generations under tropical suns.
The woman is a native of Arabia, and is
proud of it. Her name if Kathrina Chappelle,
and for almost rive years she has been a widow.
She came to California six years ago, so sh
tells. Soon afterward she was married to a
Frenchman named Chappelle. He did not live
long, and when he died the stranger from the
sands of far Arabia was thrown on her own re
sources. She equipped herself with a large
basket and loaded it with such trinkets and

necessaries as might catch the eye of the aver
age person on the street. There wore tooth
brushes, combs, purses, penknives, pipes, but
tons and other similar things. She succeeded
in selling them, and has managed in this way
to get along, apparently in a prosperous way.
At any rate, she undertakes things, and suc
ceeds iv them, by reason of her prior success,
that would appall all that class of the
sterner sex who, because of discouragements,
are constrained to jump from wharves or end
their lives in ungentlemanly ways in rooms at
public hostelries. Yy
. People have missed the cheerful face of
Kathrina for some time. But she is now visi
ble again and she told about her absence yes
terday.
"I went to my old home in Arabia a year
ago," sne said, "and saw my friends there. It
was a good visit I had and I was delighted to
be there again. I stayed several months and
then went to Venezuela; I did not know but.l
would stay there, but after I had seen and
studied the country I concluded I would do
better in California.
"As I had been absent from here a good
while, however, and my trip had cost me
some money, I concluded I would try making
some more there. So I brought a lot of things,
many of them being much like these, and
others of a character peculiarly suited to Ven
ezuelans. I bad no trouble in selling them,
and I made what money I could and then came
on here.
"Oh, no; I am hopeful and doing as well as I
could expect. People are pretty good to me
here. But, of course, I wish I could sell more,
for then I could buy many things which it
would please me to have." .

A RELIGIOUS REVIEW.
California Passes Under the Scb-Xlny of an
Eminent Chubcuman.
The Kt. Rev. J. W. Hott. a bishop of the
United Brethren church, has recently written
for the Dayton (Ohio) Religious Telescope a re
view of California from the church member's
point of view. '-yy
"The religious or non-religious aspects of
the country," the good bishop writes, "present
a peculiar medley. On one hand there is a
large class of good citizens who recognize or
care but little for the church, or Christianity
as such, and really take no part In the services
of the church in any regular way. They believe
little or nothing in particular, and seem to
care but little for the future life.
"There is below this a crowd of whleh I need
not speak. Where are they going? Who can
tell?
"Among religionists there is a still wider
range of variety. There is a bold Unitarian
ism, as it may be called, which lays aown the
largeness of thought which really lives on the
creation of vital Christianity, but itself ignores
much that is really reformatory or uplifting
and vital in Christianity as a remedial and
transforming power in human society. It
has recently received an institutional repre
sentation for Northern California in Stanford
University, whose head is its mouthpiece in
educational circles. What the final influence
of all this shall be will appear In the coming
years. It represents a broad scholarship i
dare to say, broader than it is deepâ and ac
cepts as scientific fact . that which the pro
foundest scholars of the Christian world can
only have couraee to hold as hypotheses.
Already It has produced a kind of sneer In
many. places for aggressive reformative, re
ligious, churchly effort.
- ''In anotner field there is a vast company of
spiritually minded people who hold the old or
thodox ideas of Christianity, but have empha
sized peculiar spiritual conceptions, until they
have gone out of the church into various or
ganizations, or are retaining a membership in
the church, but have little fellowship with it.
Some are Christian Scientists,- others faith
healers, and others holding intermediate, un
certain views. In the larger cities great crowds
attend faith-cure services. Many of these peo
ple, Ho doubt, have a simple, pure and beauti
ful faith in- Christ, but connect it with mon
strous ideas." ***..,
The writer has some good words for the prac
tical amelioration effected by the " Salvation
Army. - .-â¢â¢â¢.,..â 
_ "The peculiarities and eccentricities of the
salvation. Army," says Dr. Hott, "are over
looked for the sake of -their toil for those to
whom no other helping hand seems extended
in a practical way. . .
"In the midst of all* this and towering over
all stand the churches with their conservative
and abiding efforts for the building up and
saving of society. They have a peculiar battle
to wage against sin of all kinds, against sin in
the world, and formality and too often Imper
fections in their own folds. They must stand
for the progressive forms of vital Christianity.
___?* represent the highest conceptions of
thought in abiding, spiritual truth. They
must stand for the purity and permanency of i
the family and the building up of the home.
They must; guarantee the permanency of in
stitutions which aim at the preservation of all
that is beautiful and noble in our civilization.
While they foster and bless every agency of
society and state which seeks the welfare of
mankind, they must themselves interpret to
the people, from the pulpit and press and in
stitutions of learning, the open Word of God,
under the influence and power of the Holy
Spirit, thus enabling the people to compare
spiritual with material things as well as mate
rial things with spiritual.
"It would be far from this writing to under
estimate the good influences of any of the
agencies already referred to or cast any reflec
tions upon them. These peculiar missions
and the Salvation Army may do much good,
but it is to the church we must look for help
to the masses. These agencies may start good
impulses and good resolves, good faiths and
good lives, but the church is set and organized
to lift up the fallen, place them in society and
in business, in their homes and in families,
and make them a blessing to society and the
state."
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
MR. KERRIGAN ON COURSING.
To the Editor of the Ban Francisco Cailâ Sir:
| In a recent issue of your paper I am reported
I as saving that coursing is cruel and brutal
| sport, and that I am 'in it solely for the money.
In this matter I was misquoted. . Coursing,
| in my opinion, is neither cruel nor brutal as
carried out in 'the large parks around San
| Francisco. These inclosures are well provided
I with escapes, which afford the hare a better
I opportunity to beat the hounds than she has
! out on the open. plain. I wish, to say to any
man raising his voice against coursing that we
will course our greyhounds just as long as
: there are hares in California.
He cannot say that we are in it solely for the
I money, for every man who goes to coursing
j knows that there is no money to be made out
of it. The honor of having a good greyhound
or giving the public a good day's sport is as
\ much to me as all the money I ever made in
| the business. A greyhound is created by nature
I to chase a hare and a hare is also created to
] flee from the hound. This is evident from the
I tact that a hare sees behind her while running
i and can quickly turn to right or left, which
j throws her pursuers out. when they come too
; close to her. l
I fail to see why Mr. Hoibrook or any other
man can stop coursing, simply because the
hare is sometimes killed. If animals were not
killed the earth would be overrun with them,
and if hares were not killea California would
suffer to the extent of several thousand dollars
annually.
A good vicious greyhound will kill a hare as
quickly as a good butcher will kill a steer, Â«o
that, in my opinion, Mr. Holbrook's stand on
the subject of coursing is without a founda
tion, m. W. Kerrigan.

The Triple Allianceâ O. A.. City. There is
no alliance between England and Italy. The
only alliance existing In Europe. at this time
is the triple alliance, or Der Dreibund, as it is
popularly known. This is a defensive alliance
between Germany and Austria-Hungary nego
tiated at Gastein and Vienna after the Berlin
CongresÃ by Prince Bismarck in consequence
â  â¢â  â  â  -
of the unfriendly attitude of Russia. Italy
subsequently joined the league, and after its
renewal in 1887, on the arrangement of details
at the interview between Bismarck, Count
Kalnowkv and- Signer Crispl, in Frederichs
ruhe in September, the terms of the original
treaty were published. If either Austria-
Hungary or Germany is, without being aggres
sive, attacked by Russia the combined military
force of the two empires will move against that
nation." If France attacks either Germany or
Italy she must be opposed by those two powers
acting in common. If France and Russia
should combine to assail one or more of the
comblued powers the entire military and
naval strength would be called into immediate
action. ,yyy^_yy__ _____ __ __
LAST OF THE PENSACOLA.
In a few weeks the old sloop-of-war Pensa
cola will to a pile of kindling-wood. She is
now tied to the wharf at Mare Island and a
gang of men are at work removing her ma
chinery and rigging. The work has so far
progressed that the vessel stands high out of
the water and looks like a wreck. The hull haÂ«
been ordered sold, but it is not in good condi
tion and will very likely have to be broken up
for want oi a purchaser. â¢,-â¢-- _
The Pensacola is about the last of the vessels
of her class built by the Government for ser
vice in the War of the Rebellion. Soon
after she was finished in 1802 she was sent
to the mouth of the Mississippi to form a
part of Farra-ut's fleet. She was the first ves
sel to be dragged across the bar, and at the
time received more of a thumping than most
vessels get in many years of service. -
In all her career the Pensacola has been
noted for having narrow escapes. At the pa*.

sage of the forts below New Orleans she was
struck several times, but somehow the shot
were deflected so that she received little in
jury. The first night of the bombardment she
was a short distance from shore when the big
rebel ram Manassas came at her. It looked as
if the Pensacola 8 career was ended right there,
but the man at the wheel swung her around so
nicely that the Manassas struck her only a
glancing blow that did not the least damage.
The Pensacola was in several tight places dur
ing that fight, but through the rest of the war
did little more than guard duty.
The Swatara has already been dismantled
and is to be ordered sold. She is lying in the
stream in front of Mare Island and seems to be
a good ship yet. Her timbers are perfectly
sound, as she was not built until 1871 and has
seen little service. With new rigging and out
sloe planking there is no reason why she
would not do good service for many years to
come. . â  ." , yy,

NEW CLUBHOUSE
FOR INGLESIDE
A Magnificent Structure for
the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club.
IN OLD MISSION STYLE.
Comfort, Luxury and Picturesque
ness to Be Combined in
the Building.
WORK TO BEGIN VERY SOON.
Superb Furnishingsâ Finest Race.
track Building in the
Country.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club will soon
have at Ingleside one of the handsomest
and most superbly furnished clubhouses
in the country. The contracts and plans
have been recorded and signed for the new
structure, and the work oi construction
will be commenced at once. Advantage
will be taken of the summer season to push
the work to completion and have the
building ready for the opening reception
at the next wintei meeting.
The architect is T. J. Welsh, whose
plans call for a building in the old Mission
style, having in its composition a Vene
tian effect.
On the ground floor the simple and
powerful arcades, with arched openings
and ample abutments, are counterparted
very effectively by wide and spacious
porches and balconies of the second floor
topped out in Belvedere fashion.
The central portion of the building, in
order to obtain a picturesque sky line, rises
one story higher above the belvederes of
the east aud west . porches and is crowned
by a large projecting cornice with wood
beams, soffit and dental course.
The roof of this central portion is of
Spanish tiles, so that the entire effect, in
stead of being disturbed by the lack of
ornaments, is enhanced in its total impres
sion of simplicity. The large arched open
ing, with its traceric finish of the second
floor, together with the balconies of the
first floor, gives the composition the Vene
tian effect, and will make the clubhouse
a picturesque object from any point of
wiew.
The building will be located 173 feet west
of the grand stand and connected with
the latter by a two-story colonnade, which
will be continued west of the clubhouse
to connect with the railroad station at the
extreme west of the grounds. V ;_B
The building has a frontage of 95 feet
and a depth of 65 feet. The foundation is
to be of concrete. The upper structure
will be of wood plastered on the outside on
galvanized iron wire laths, to give the
finish of the old Mission architecture.
The ground floor has storerooms in the
rear and open arcades in front, forming
the nassage from the railroad station to
the grand-stand.
The porte cochere, which is elaborately
constructed with large columns and Span
ish tile roof, is connected with the main
entrance steps, which are located on the
southeast corner of the building. These
steps lead to the 14-foot inside porch that
extends along the entire south and east
fronts, giving a magnificent view of the
entire track. This porch is easily accessi
ble from within by large double swinging
doors from the halls and lobby, and with
the corresponding porch above on the sec
ond floor will form one of the club's great
est attractions during the racing season.
The general sitting-room has a frontage
of thirty-four feet facing the track, by
twenty feet deep, richly finished in wood
with wainscoting, picture moulding, cor
nices, and a large brick fireplace nine feet
wide, intended to receive a large log fire.
To the right of the lobby is a parlor four
teen feet square and to the left the office
fourteen feet by twenty, with bay-window
and connecting private rooms all facing
the track, with a magnificent view of the
ocean. 1..;. ". v.
The club bar is fourteen feet by twenty
two feet and connects with a lobby in the
rear, having also in close proximity and
connection store and serving rooms, with
dumb waiters and service stairs. A toilet
room is conveniently located. All the
rooms open into the central hall, and a
wide stairway leads to the second story
reserved for ladies. X
Along the entire south and east front a
14-foot porch corresponds with the porch
below, being accessible from the halls, and
the parlor, fronting the^track, 34 feet by 20
feet, is well finished and has a large fire
place, forming altogether a charming re
treat for the ladies. One dining-room is
connected to the right and two to the left
of the parlor. Ample window space and

bay* windows in each room give splendid
views of the track and the ocean.
In the center of the second floor a
spacious hall is located, all rooms and a
kitchen opening into it, also serving rooms,
service stairs, ladies' waiting and toilet
rooms. < y : y-'y yy-Y'y
The needs of the club have been care
fully attended to in the preparation of the
plants, and all thelatest ideas and im
prpvements have been applied, making
the structure one of the finest of its kind
in the country.
NEWTON'S PATRIOTISM.
Why He Shot Four Men Who Called
Him a Foreigner. .
C. B. Newton, charged with assault to
murder committed on four men, is tem
porarily at liberty, for the jury which tried
his case failed to agree. Some jurors
wanted to render a verdict of assault with
a deadly weapon, and others wanted to
find for simple assault, but there were
more who wanted to find on the original
charge.
Newton, who is of a patriotic disposi
tion, was robbed of some money in a
saloon, and he complained at the bar.
Three or four men were standing round,
and they volunteered to fight the "for
eigner." as they termed Newton, and his
patriotic blood being aroused, he told them
to come on. The four piled onto him and
got him as far as the floor/when he com
menced shooting. He managed to put a
bulletin each of the four, and then flushed
with victory, he refused to be arrested by
any but an American policeman. Newton
hopes to be acquitted on his next trial.

WANT II HEARD AGAIN
The De la Montanya Case May
Come Up Once
More.
A Petition Filed Asking the Supreme
Court to Reconsider' the Case
bbj Just Decided.
A petition for a rehearing in the De la
Montanya case has been filed by Delmas &
Shotridge in the Supreme Court.
The petition asks that the rights of
Mrs. de la Montanya to her chil
dren be again heard and passed upon.
She had a'-ked for the custody of the
children, but the Supreme Court de
cided that the children, having been take
to Europe by their father, were out of the
jurisdiction of the courts of California,
and so the Superior Court did wrong in
awarding them to the care of their
mother.
In the petition for a rehearing it is I
argued that the power to grant a divorce j
by the lower court included the power to
award the custody of the children. If the
court could annul or set aside a marriage
and destroy the relation of husband, it
has power to readjust the relations of th
children, who are incident to the mar
riage. *- Â','â 
The position is taken that the parent
have the custody of the children by a sort
of joint tenancy, and when that joint ten
ancy is dissolved by a court the court
surely has power to determine the rights
of the parents in the children.
\ A further point is made that if the court
can, on a summons by publication, divorce
two people, it can on the same summons
allot the custody of the children to either.

Narrow Escape of the Thetis
During Thursday's South
wester.
RAN FOR A PORT OF REFUGE.
The Bark Sharpshooter Now Almost
Transformed Into an American
Barkentine.
."The British bark Sharpshooter is being
rapidly transformed into an American
barkentine. After her disastrous experi
ence in the Gulf of California she was
towed to this port try the tug Fearless, and
after months spent in liquidation was
finally sold to a syndicate of South Sea
Island tradeis. For years they ran the
bark Helen W. Almy, but last year Cap
tain Luttrell decided that it would cost too
much to make her seaworthy for a long
voyage, so she was condemned.
In her place the schooner Viking was
placed and is now on her way from the
Marshall group. On her arrival she will
. go into the coasting trade and the Sharp
| shooter will go out on a round trip for
: Fiji, Tongatabu, Samoa, Hawaii, .Tahiti,
the Gilbert group, the Marquesas and other
trading stations in the southern seas.
Captain Luttrell does not know that he is
to have an almost new vessel, and the
chances are that he will aim at making a
record with her.
The Sharpshooter has been overhauled
from stem to stern. As she was practi
cally dismasted when towed into port lit
tle work with the removing of the spars
had to be done. The iron hull has been
chipped, however, the deck removed and
a new one put in place, and now the work
of stepping the ______ has begun, Inside
of a week the Sharpshooter will be practi-
I cally a new vessel, Hying the American
I flag.
The survey boat Thetis got in from San'
| Diego yesterday after a very boisterous
â¢ passage. The nien-of-warsmen were more
I than glad to reach port, and assert that
j had it not been for the. friendly shelter of
j Port Harford they would never have
j reached San Francisco. The Thetis was
j caught in the squall that wrecked the
I Blairmore, and had it not been for good
! seamanship she would have gone down.
i As it was the men consider they had a
very narrow escape.
The Thetis left San Diego last Thursday,
and when a few hours out the gale came
up. The bark-rigged warship was under
canvas, and with the first gust almost
went on her beam ends. She quickly re
covered and sail was at once reduced, j
while extra steam was got on the boilers. i
As the storm increased, the captain deter
mined to make lor Port Harford, where
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's j
Bonita was found to have already taken j
refuge.
The officers of the Thetis are: Lieuten
ants C.A.Clark, W. S. Hughes, F. M. I
Busturies, W. Braunersreuther, Assistant
Paymaster I. Irwin Jr., Passed Assistant !
Engineer T. F. Buredorff, Surgeon G. A. !

The "Sin bad" Company and the James
O'Neill Company made things lively on
the Oregon dock yesterday morning. They
were all passengers on the steamer ; State
of California for Portland, ' i and a con
course of their friends were down to see
them off. As the steamer moved away
from the wharf the members of the opera
company gathered on the port side and
sang: .... . ....

And cross the raging main,
And I'll be off to my own true love ten thousand
miles away. ;- v ..'.'
The steamers Modoc and Herald, owned
by the Southern Pacific, were in collision
last Saturday night 'and! the blame is all
laid at the door of the commander of the
revenue cutter Rush. "The searchlight on
the latter was being tried and in an op
portune moment (from the standpoint of
the cutter's captain) was turned on Mis
sion-street wharf. The electric glare made
it impossible for the captain of the Modoc
to see anything and in consequence he
had to make his landing by guess work.
Turning into the slip the Modoc struck
the Herald and both "vessels were consid
erably damaged. A few minutes later the
Monticello arrived from, Vallejo and again
the searchlight of the Rush was turned on.
Captain Randall did not know what to
do, but finally decided to stop his vessel:
It was lucky he did so, as had he run into
the sliD he would have run down the Mo
doc and Herald, which were struggling to
extricate themselves from the tangle occa
sioned by the collision. Captains of bay
and river steamers express a wish that the
men-of-war and revenue cutters would
test their search lights somewhere else
than on the landing slips.

CLAUSSi.N'S SENTENCE.
He Is Evidently Well Pleased to Escape
From the Noose.
The life sentence set by the jury as a fit
punishment for Nicholas Claussen for the
murder of his wife was passed by Judge
Wallace yesterday morning.
There was no plea for time and no mo
tion for a new trial. The prisoner wanted
his sentence further lightened by being al
lowed to choose his own prison, but Judge
Wallace sentenced him merely to the peni
tentiary for life. He said in passing sen
tence that he did not see how the jury
could have added any sentence limit to
their verdict, as the crime was a cold
blooded one, done with premeditation,
without provocation and without remorse.
Had a motion for a new trial been made it
is not improbable that it would have been
granted, but it was evident that both the
defendant and his counsel considered that
the luck of one trial might not stand in
another. yy~, : y

A. H. Dean Helps Him Out
With Seme Testi- "_.;
mony.
Dean Says He Did Not Raise the
Check, Nor Does He Know
Who Did Do It.
The case against Joe McCluskey, alias
J. W. Costa, alias etc., who was charged
with forgery for being implicated in the
check-raising which victimized the Nevada
Bank, has been dismissed. â¢
.The prosecution finished its case early
yesterday morning, and J. N. E. Wilson,
counsel for. McCluskey, then asked the
court to instruct the jury to acquit on the
ground that the evidence was not suffi
cient to hold him. The motion was
granted.
The only evidence the prosecution had
to convict McCluskey was that of "Wylie
Lyle, | Dean's office-boy, and Thomas
Grant, paying teller of the Nevada Bank,
but neither of these would swear they had
ever seen McCluskey in Dean's company.
Part of the evidence of the prosecution
was a document written by Dean admit
ting that he passed the check and prepared
the plan, but denying that he had any
hand in the raising of the check or any
knowledge of the person "who raised it.
Ti.is was put in for the purpose of proving
Dean's connection with the crime, and
consequently the complicity of McCluskey.
The statement is typewritten and is quite
long. It sets forth that Dean drew the
check and how he started East to spend it.
It also describes how he worked up an ac
count in the Nevada Bank, all of which
has been told, and it ends by exonerating
McCluskey. y~. '-/-'y y.
Arrested for Kidnaping.
Cheung Chow Fate, an unusually enlight
ened Chinese, who for the last twelve years
has been making a living for himself and
family by driving an express-wagon, was ar
rested last evening on complaint of Ah Yee, a
fellow-countryman, and booked at . the Cali-
fornia-street police station on a charge of kid
naping. Ah Yee alleges that the prisoner
enticed his wife, Ah Gum, down from the
Sacramento Valley and installed her in his
home as its mistress. Cheung Chow Fate de
nies this and says that he simply rented her a
room in his house, for which she paid him in
advance. Cheung has a wife and three boys
of his own, and the police are inclined to be
lieve that it was acas-; of malice on the part
of the complainant in having caused his
arrest. . . " V- : .-':.

ADVANCES
THROUGH RATES.
An Average of 25 Per Cent
Decided Upon at Mil
waukee.
FREIGHT MEN ADJOURN.
May 1 to See the Revised Sched
ules Put In All Over the
Country.
CALIFORNIA TO BE PROTECTED.
Westbound Freight Will Bear the
Greater Part cf the In
creased Charges.
Ever since the announcement that the
Transcontinental Traihc Association had
been reorganized in New York the great
question with tie merchants aud shippers
of the whole country has been, What ad
vance in freight rates will result? That
rates would be advanced was a conclusion
that ever\ one who had any interest in
shipping matters reached as soon as the
news came of the re-formation of the great
combine of the railroads engaged in trans
continental transportation.
It is now just two weeks since the gen
eral freight agents of the lines interested
first came together at Milwaukee to dis
cuss and arrange for tariffs on a basis that
would be mutually satisfactory to all the
railroads in the deal. During all this
period not a word or intimation has
reached the public as to what might be ex
pected in the way of changed rates, and it
has kept the local merchants guessing in a
way that has been most trying to their
nerves.
From a local railroad man in close touch
with the late Milwaukee conference it was
learned yesterday that the freight agents
had completed their work on Saturday,
and that the meeting had adjourned after
Dr. George Chismore. Elected President of the Bohemian Club.
[From a painting in the Bohemian Club.]
arriving at results of a most satisfactory
character. Speaking evidently by the card
this gentleman said:
"There will probably be an advance on
westbound rate? that will average about _.">
per cent on the present rates. Some things
will bear a greater percentage of increase
than this and others less, but the average
will be as stated. There is no disposition
to make an advance that will create any
idea of unfairness, but rates have been
forced so low during the past three years
of bitter competition that no one has made
any money. This is shown by the large
number of roads that have gone into the
hands of receivers.
"The new rates will take effect about the
Ist of May. They will be published simul
taneously by all the roads, after receiving
the joint concurrence of all lines inter
ested. The lines west of the Missouri take
action on the rates west of the river, and
the Eastern roads on those from the Mis
souri to the Atlantic seaboard.
"The rate schedules are all in the hands
of the chairman of the transcontinental
freight rate committee at Chicago and the
exact time when they will go into effect
will to some extent depend on the work of
the printer."
"How about eastbound rates?" was
asked.
"So far as articles of California pro
duction are concerned any increase on
them will be made on a very conservative
basis. The roads having the greatest in
terest in the Transcontinental Association
have also the greatest interest in Califor
nia productions and the welfare and de
velopment of the State. They are there
fore not likely to take any steps that i
would embarrass California productions, ;
so far as they are able to control the situ
ation. You can say this, however: .
"On such articles as green fruit, dried
fruit, raisins, prunes and similar California
products it is Quite unlikely that any con
siderable advance will be made and it is
possible that none may be made at ail."
In conversation with several of the larg
est shippers on the subject of the proposed !
increase in rates it was learned that they
did not consider a 25 per cent average ad
vance excessive in view of the manner in
which rates had been slashed in the vari
ous conflicts during the past three years
* i
between the allied railroads and the North
American Navigation Company first and
the Panama Railroad Company later.
LEFT THE ENGINE.
Fireman Frank Lawlor Suing for Dam
age. Sustained While Trying to
Save His Life. ~
' The trial of the damage suit by Frank
Lawlor against the Southern Pacific Com
pany opened before Judge Hunt yesterday
morning...
Lawlor is suing to recover $25,000 for in
juries received. in the collision between
two trains at San Ardo station on Novem
ber 3, 1893. Lawlor himself was the prin
cipal witness of the day.
He said he was fireman of the engine
which drew the paycar for the cost di
vision of the Southern Pacific Railroad,
and which left San Francisco on Novem-
ber 2, 1893. The car reached Castroville
that evening and next morning at 5 o'clock
it started south again. It stopped at San
Lucas, and there the station agent told
the conductor of the paycar that he had
plenty of time to run to San Ardo. The
paycar went on for San Ardo. It was a
foggy morning and the engineer could not
see very far ahead' He went on, however,
until he thought he was near the station,
and then he shut off steam so as to bring
the train under control. As he did so he
suddenly called to the fireman to jump, at
the same time turning on the airbrake
and throwing back the reverse lever.
Law lor looked ahead and saw an engine
about 000 feet ahead of them, so without
more ado he jumped. He was severely
and permanently injured, and as the rail
road has offered no compromise he is suing
lor it. His theory is that had it not been
for the negligent manner of keeping track
of the trains the paycar and its engine
could have been able to avoid the train at
San Ardo.
TO RULE OWL DESTINIES.
Dr. Chismore Elected the New
President of the Bohem
ian Club.
He Belonged to the 0 d Guard of the
Organization â No Opposition
Ticket.
The twenty-fourth annual election of
the Bohemian Club took place yesterday
and the following-named officers were
elected for the ensuing year: President,
Dr. George Chismore; vice-president, Pe
ter Robertson; secretary, Donald de V.
Graham; treasurer, James A. Thompson.
Directors for two yearsâ William Sproule,
George F. Grant, C. H. Maddox, George H.
Mastick.
Dr. Chismore, the â¢ newly elected presi
dent, belongs to the old guard of the club,
having joined the organization when the
owl perched on Sacramento street. He
served one term as president in 1886-87
when the club lived on Pine street, and
his administration was highly successful.
There were no exciting features in the
election yesterday. A fake opposition
ticket, which had been printed and cir
culated for amusement, was withdrawn
before the polls opened.
The annual meeting of the club will be
held to-day. It is understood that the in
stitution is out of debt, having liquidated
the $25,000 due Simon Wenban for build
ing the house on Sutter street.
The directors holding over for another
year are George Whcaton, W. E. Davis, EÂ«~
R. Dimond and Vanderlynn Stow. The
number of votes cast at yesterday's elec
tion was ninety-eight. The judges were
George T. Bromley and Colin Smith.

CHINESE FLAGS WARLIKE
Their Exhibition Calculated to
Provoke a Riot in China
town.
THEY MAY MOT BE FLAUNTED.
The Supervisors Decide Not to Visit
the Templadera Until Next
Week.
Yesterday's meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors was one of the speediest on
record when the amount of business
transacted is taken into consideration.
The reading of the minutes began _at
2:45 and the board adjourned at 3:45, not
one of the members having made a speech
or even a remark upon any subject.
'the bulk of the business was of the rou
tine uninteresting character, the only
action of the board that was not dry being
the laying over for one week of Supervisor
Morgenstern's resolution that the mem
bers of the board visit the Templadera
source of water supply near Castroville, in
Monterey County.
Chief of Police Crowley sent an alarm
ing communication to the board, setting
forth that the Chinese Consul and the
better class of the Gee Gar Sung family are
in favor of the board's refusing to grant
permission to that family to erect a flag
pole on the roof of 800 Dupont street, the ,
Chief of Police alleging as a reason that
the various Chinese societies and families
would be making application for similar
privileges, and ii they were not all treated
alike dissension in the Chinese auarter
might be created and a riot might be pro
voked.

NEEDS OF THE HOSPITAL
Dr. Conrad Weil Wants a New
Operating-Room Fully
Equipped.
If the Supervisors Do Not Appropriate
the Money He Will Make a
Public Appeal.
Dr. Conrad Weil, head surgeon at the
Receiving Hospital, is making strenuous
efforts to get a new operating-room in the
hospital fitted with all the modern require
ments, which he claims is absolutely
necessary.
The present operating-room is badly
equipped. It has also the serious objec
tion of being in a direct line with the
entrance, and patients are exposed to
draughts, foul air and other inconveniences.
It would be tolerable for ordinary cases,
but for critical cases it is highly objection
able.
According to the original plans of the
hospital a room in the interior away from
draughts and the noise and annoyance of
people passing out and in was set apart
for an operating-room. The room is there,
but there is nothing except the bare walls.
"I have addressed a lengthy communi
cation to the Board of Health on the sub
ject," said Dr. Weil yesterday, "but I am
sorry to say the board is without funds.
They recognize the crying need for anew
operating-room and will ask the Board of
Supervisors to appropriate the necessary
funds. It will require from $1500 to $2000.
We need a modern antiseptic operating
table, racks for solution bottles, a case for
instruments, new and modern instruments,
bandages, gowns and other appliances, j
"If the Board of Supervisors does not
appropriate the money 1 will make a pub
lic appeal for the funds, and I feel sure
some spirited citizen or body of
citizens will come to the rescue just as
Mrs. Oelrichs ana Miss Fair did in provid
ing the ambulance, "-fz. '-v -
"[ could mention eight or nine cases
within the past ten months where men's
lives might have been saved if we had been
provided with the new operating-room. j
"In many critical cases at present we
have to send the patient to the City and
County Hospital or let him die on our
thands. - - - --;-% â-- - ..;...
"In the interests of humanity it is time
we had the new I operating-room equipped
and I hope in the near future to be able
to announce that some philanthropic citi
zen lias been the means of -putting an end
to the present unsatisfactory, state of af
fairs." .- , :'y '.'â¢/â¢ i â  _"j in I
A DRUNKEN BURGLAR.
William Sanborn, Who Fell Thirty
'b- Feet, Booked at the City
Prison. . -
A charge of attempt Jit burglary was
registered against William Sanborn, the
dive performer, at the City Prison yester
day morning. The complaining witness is
A. Webster, 1001 Jones' street.
Sanborn had sufficiently recovered from
his injuries received by his fall of thirty
feet from the roof of the alleyway between
Webster's house and Mrs. M. E. Brown's
boarding-house, 1034 Pine street, early
Sunday morning, to be removed from the
Receiving Hospital to the prison yesterday
morning.
"I don't know how I got there," said
Sanborn. "I drank an awful lot of whisky
on Saturday night. I suppose after leaving
my friends'- walked aimlessly along till 1
got to Pine and Jones street. I don't re
member climbing onto the roof â in fact, I
remember nothing till I found myself in
the hospital, and then I had to ask how I
got there. ; ;
"If I had intended to commit a burglary
I wouldn't have got drunk and would have
had some burglars' tools with me. The
only thing found upon me was my jack
knife and the key of my room. There was
nobody with me after I left my friends."
Detective Fitzgerald is still working on
the case, but he nas not yet succeeded In
arresting the man who was supposed to
have been with Sanborn.
A Bogus -Entertainment.
J. J. Smith was convicted in Judge Low's
court yesterday of the charge of obtaining
money by false pretenses, and ordered to ap
pear for sentence to-day. On February 6 he
and two others went to Dr. Simpson, Potrero
avenue, and sold him two tickets for $1 for an
entertainment to be given in South Park Hall
for the benefit of George R. Allen, an employe
of the sugar refinery. It was proved that there
was no such hall in the City and no such em
ploye at the sugar refinery as George R. Allen.

New Railroad Town, to Be
Fathered by the South
ern Pacific.
NEAR THE COUNTY LINE
Roundhouse and Repair Shops
to Be Removed to South
San Francisco.
ALONG THE BADEN SHORT LINE
Work on the Proposed Enterprise
Delayed Only by the Lack of
Ready Money.
In connection with the plan of the
Southern Pacific Company to construct a
short line to Baden via the Potrero and
South San Francisco there is another im
portant enterprise. This is said to be
nothing less than the creation of a railroad
town, similar to that of Pullman, near
Chicago, on the property of tho Southern
Pacific Company and its individual share
holders In this and San Mateo counties,
where the two counties join.
It has long been known that the railroad
contemplate constructing a short line
through this section, and that this would
have been the original route but for the
opposition of certain landholders twenty
five years ago, but it is only recently that
numerous developments have indicated
that the Southern Pacific people had
something more in view in making heavy
Rand purchases in the Potrero, and more
particularly in South San Francisco, than
securing a right of way.
Not only has the railroad corporation
made such purchases, but the Crocker
estate and Mrs. Stanford are now large
holders of realty along the Mission Bay
line.
It has been admitted by Manager Fill
more that the repair shops near the foot
of Sixth street were to be removed so as to
be close to the roundhouse used in con
junction with the coast division of the
Southern Pacific Company. It was also
admitted that the roundhouse was to be
moved from its present location so as to be
"alongside the track." Now as the track
is to be strung along the newly acquired
right of way of the Southern Pacific Com
pany through the Potrero and South San
Francisco, there is no doubt in the minds
of those who have been closely watching
the operations of the railroad company in
this locality that the roundhouse and re
pair shops of the coast division, which
will eventually and shortly be those
of the Sunset road, are to be removed to
South San Francisco. Here the company
has one immense tract to the east of it's
proposed new line and also has quite a
number of other respectable-sized tracts
to the west of the track. It is expected
that the roundhouse will be placed on the
i .art lying between the line of the railroad
and the bay and the shops will be located
partly on this tract and partly on the
other smaller ones.
Immediately adjoining this largest piece
of land, comprising some 200 acres, the
Crocker estate owns a large area extend
ing from the right of way clear to the
water front. This has unusual advant
ages for suburban residences, its frontage
on the bay consisting of a high bluff, with
a magnificent beach to the north in the
bight between the railroad property and
that owned by the Crocker estate.* The
latter also owns a fine and large area just
over the line in San Mateo County.
From recent developments it is" believed
that all the spare land not necessary to the
proper equipment and maintenance of the
Southern Pacific roundhouse and shops
will be cut up into lots to be sold to the
people who will find employment with the
railroad company.
That it is the probable purpose of the
company to develop this section into a
busy and thriving town is further indi
cated by its announced intention of con
verting the former Bay View racetrack,
which it now owns, into a general recrea
tion ground, where races and all kinds of
athletic spurts can be carried on. Then
the Market-street Railway Company has
two lines of street-cars tapping this dis
trict. Along the San Bruno road runs a
horsecar line, which will be converted
into an electric line, while along Railroad
avenue there now run electric cars to the
heart of San Francisco.
. i; is only the lack of ready money that
prevents this work of improvement" being
taken up at once. With means at com
mand the sixty-mile gap between Elwood
and Viaduct on the coast route could be
pushed to completion within four months,
and at the same time work on the short
Mne from San Francisco to Baden could
also be prosecuted, co that when the gap
down south was closed the through trains
could at once come in over the Mission
Bay route. That this programme is in
contemplation is shown by the action re
cently taken by the Southern Pacific Com
pany in reference to the vegetable gar
deners who are occupying its land. All
leases have been allowed to run out, and
the tenants have been notified that they
hold hereafter only at the will of the com
pany, and that they may be given notice
to vacate at any time.
AN OLD-TIME CAPTAIN.
Death of John Kgan of the Third Regi
ment, California Militia.
John Egan, a well-known merchant of
this City, passed !a way at his home, 122
Inge street, yesterday at the age of 68
years.
Mr. Egan was for years a member of the
wholesale firm of Kelly & Egan, engaged
in business on Battery street, near Jack
son. For a time he was a prominent
ligure in Democratic political circles, and
atone time held a commission' of one of
ihe companies of the Third Regiment of
the California State militia, when it was
known as the Irish regiment. He leaves
a widow, several children and a brother,
Daniel Bgan. He was a native of Shauna
golden. County Limerick, Ireland.
The funeral "will take place from his late
residence at 10 o'clock this morning.
About ten years ago Captain Eean began
the study of the Gaelic language, .and
since that time has read and written much
of that ancient tongue, which is the
mother of all that is original of the Eng
lish language. The Captain's fine classical
training fitted him for this work, and he
became one of the best Gaelic scholars in
the United States. He possessed a mass
of manuscripts, many of which were
translations of the old Gaelic into the
modern Irish language and also into Eng
lish. Up to the day of his death he was'
engaged in his researches in the ancient
tongue of the Celts.

manded payment of his poll tax and on being
requested to call at the Mission for it he struck
Fuji wars in the face. Martin was convicted

Siebe paid the fine and informed the court that
he had discharged Martin.

The "committee drill" at the Woman's

The various committees, newly formed,
held lengthy conferences and were as

justice by insisting upon women attending
the Lane trial. They would allow the
public to think they were "persecuting"

upon the report was that the ladies had as
much right to lend the protection of their
presence to victimized women and chil

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1896.
THE PLAY IS THE THING.
Mrs. Hager's Theatricals a So
cial and Artistic Suc
cess.
BEAUTIFUL LIVING PICTURES.
Society, in Gorgeous Raiment, Waits
With Bated Breath for the Cur
tain to Rise.
There is an author somewhere, hereto
fore unknown, who awoke this morning
and found himself famous.
He sought not gloryâ at least there is
!no record of this factâ had honor
! thrust upon him.-
When a few weeks ago Mrs. Ilager made
j arrangements to entertain her friends in a ;
| manner befitting society's leader private
I theatricals were decided upon.
This artistic manner of entertainment
recommended itself for two reasons. In
the first place it was entirely newâ or
rather old enough for a revival to be
frantically welcomed. Then there is some
j thing deliciously romantic in private the
! atricals. Young people dote on them. No
| modern novel of fashionable life is com
[ plete without a chapter devoted to this
artistic amusement. And when it is
| brought into the very midst of the real
i social life the delicate fragrance of the
romance still clings to it.
And so the. play was declared the thing,
and the wires flashed a message to an
Eastern theatrical bureau asking for a
play, or rather a modern comedy, for
amateurs. :V .VyA'y/v'*" ,y..y;-!.y
The only conditions stipulated was the
play must be bright, merry and light. "A
Modern Ananias" was chosen, and im
mediately upon the receipt of the manu
script the fashionable amateurs began to I
workâ that hard, dry never ending work
â which artists sigh when they speak of
and without which no successes attained. j
There never were such earnest amateurs. I
Lines were committed to memory in no I
time, then they began to pick their
parts to pieces. Miss Houghton, so her in
timate friends have said, lay awake at !
night searching .the records of her mem
ory for fetching shrugs, delicious pouts
and fascinating glances to enhance the j
rather tame charms of Miss Golden Gate. !
1 Miss Goodall, so say these same intimate
friends, has for the past month eliminated
all polysyllables from her conversation and
puckered up her rosy lips three times a
day, on half hour struggles with "prunes
and prisms.'" And all this heroic devotion
for "Prudence Mayflower, with New Eng
land Fancies," a tart New England mode
of expressing herself. And Miss Rose
Hooper, charming, fetching, fascinating,
delightful "Kitty." well it could not have'
been all study, it is a case of "to the man
ner born." '"â¢â¢'â¢', â . - y*
And the men? Why there never was a
more graceful, airy prevaricator ; than
Frank Matthieu. John Drew has tried it
now and then; but with the fashionable
audience last evening it was a question I
whether he (that is, Drew) was as great a
success. Certain it is there never has been
a richer Piccadilly accent, with clothes to
match, than Edgar Peixotto displayed,
nor a bigger-hearted, more loving and for
giving old soldier than "Colonel Lyon" j
borough.
George de Long played Francisco with
an elastic conscience, in a manner â worthy
the distinguished master the playwright
provided for him. And last, but not least,
Frank Owen's "Baby, a little tootsie
wootsie," recalled those feeling days , that
the old theater-goers tell us of, when a
comedian was a comedian, and not an
acrobatic endman. v ./;.â¢ â ; y^'-y
-And thus it is that the commonplace
dialogue and situations of a modest little
comedy were, by . the tact, discretion and
savoir faire of the talented players and the
artistic skill of Stage Manager Cooper,
raised to the level of an artistic and suc
cessful modern comedy, and its author,
J. A. Fraser Jr., listed among the famous
j playwrights. .'
I But all the glory of the well-acted play
did not overshadow in the slightest the
! three living pictures " which' preceded the
i performance. Sir Frederick Leighton's
j famous painting, "Summer Morn," was
picturesquely portrayed by Miss Hoffman
and Miss Thomas. These two pretty girls
I formed a charming contrast, Miss Hoffman
with her dark, deep eyes and cheeks like
the rose, and Miss Thomas pale and
blonde, with the touch of gold to her soft
hair.
The next picture, "Reveries," was
charmingly posed by Miss Daisy Van
Ness. The lights 'and shades of this pic
ture wore artistically managed and the
curtain had to be raised time and time
again.
"La Tosca," Harboy's famous canvas,
found a fair prototype in Miss Alice
Hager. Her gown, a clinging empire
dress, was fashioned of green silk. A pic
ture hat with nodding bunches of pink
plumes crowned the stately head and sat
lightly upon the pretty hair, which might
aptly be compared to a tangled vein of
gold. With one hand she grasped the long
stick and in the other she held an im
mense bunch of American Beauty roses.
This picture was received with rapturous
applause. bl'yi:
As for the audience, everybody who is
anybody was there. The curious throng
that blocked the entrance to the Native
Sons' Hall burst forth in "Oh's!" and
"Ah's!" as they caught glimpses of bright
eyes and flowerlike faces shrouded in
costly laces and now and then a glimmer
of rich satin and the flash of costly jewels.
Within it looked like the never-to-be
forgotten days when La Diva awoke the
echoes in the Grand Opera-house. Jewels
flashed, silks rustled, satins shimmered,
and faultless sturdy forms in the sublime
glory of dress coat, white satin tie and
dainty bouttoniere marued the decided
contrast between the gorgeous apparel of
the fair sex and the simple elegance of the
sterner half of humanity.
The seating of the vast audience was re
duced to a perfect science in the capable
hands of Messrs. E. H. Sheldon, Horace
Piatt, Walter L. Dean, Samuel Boardman,
B. J. Horton, 8. G. Buckbee, W. B.
Heath, E. N. Bee, Frank Van Ness an d
Al Williams. All were quietly and quickly
assigned places, and when the curtain
rose, promptly at 9, every one of the 400
chairs was occupied and you could have
heard a pin drop.
The appearance of the hall was beauti
ful in the extreme. Palest pink and
faintest blue bunting radiated from the
chandelier to the balcony, forming a
canopy of delicate color. Palms lined the
walls and in the pretty reception and dress
ing rooms there were bunches of cut
flowers and delicate ferns.
In the lobby gaudy colored posters an
nounced the "event "of the evening and
resting on an easei was an immense frame
containing the portraits of. the "Hager
Theatrical Company," in scenes from "A
Modern Ananias."
The play was handsomely mounted.
The scene of the first act, a charming ex
terior, was designed by Willis Polk. The
costuming of the ladies of the play was
artistic and modish. In the first act Miss
Houghton wore a stylish gown of white
mull over yellow satin, and a picturesque
white leghorn garden hat with nodding
American beauties. Mrs. Goodall's gown
was of pink satin and chiffonâmodish and
becoming. In the second act Miss Good
all's gown was a charming creation of
white tulle over white satin, and Miss
Houghton appeared at her best in an
evening gown in which pale blue chiffon
and golden brown velvet were happily
mingled.
Immediately after the performance sup
per was served, after which dancing was
inaugurated ana continued until 2 in the
morning.
There was some very stunning gowns
worn by the ladies present. Miss Laura
McKmstry was as usual all in black. Her
gown was of black tulle over a silk founda
tion, and the only bit of color was the tiny
thread of gold which outlined the decol
letageand a narrow gold bolt. Mrs. Daisy
Van Ness wore a modest pink satin gown,
Miss Carrie Taylor wore also a pink gown,
the decolletage of the tulle around bodice
being outlined with marguerites.
Miss McNptt was beftominply attired in
a pale-green crepe, trimmed with bands of
emerald-green velvet.
Miss' Lizzie Carroll was also in green â a
delicate Nile-green silk, the corsage elab
orately trimmed with spangled lace.
Miss Frances Curry's gown was of pale
blue crepe, and she wore a bunch of pink
roses, fastened coquettish ly Â»t the shoulder,
r. Mrs. J. R. K. Nuttall wore a white silk
gown veiled with white chiffon.
Miss Mary Belle G win wore a pale pink
gown, the decollete corsage, trimmed with
a bertha of rare old lace.
â â , Miss Isabel McKenna looked extremely
lovely in white silk and tulle.
Miss Romie Wallace wore also a white
silk veiled with tulle.
. Miss Mamie Purling was attired in white
silk, and; had a deep red rose pinned in

Miss Tiny O'Connor was all in white,
her decollete corsage being covered with
innumerable tiny tulle flowers.

in a pale-blue satin, the corsage and jnpe

CHALLENGES VOORSANGER
Rev. E. S. Weyler Says He Is
the Jew the Rabbi
Denounced.
INDORSED BY METHODISTS.
Never Cost the Missions a CentâPres
byterians Discuss Rent ani
Interest.
"There is no doubt that I am the man
to whom Dr. Voorsanger referred last
week when he spoke of a Jew connected
with the Christian-Jewish . Mission who
had lost caste among his own people. He
made reference especially to one who
claimed to be descended from David. Ac
cording to tradition I am descended from
David, but I do not care a fig for that sort
of tradition. I have never even made the
claim myself." ;'yojYy
It was Rev. S. â¢ Weyler of Benicia ho
made this statement at the Methodist
preachers' meeting yesterday morning.
Mr. Weyler is a Congregational pastor and
a frequenter of the Congregational Mon
day Club, where he has joined regularly
in the discussions. He stated yesterday
that his object in addressing his Metho
dist brethren was to refute Rabbi Voor
sanger's statements with regard to him
self in particular and with regard to Chris
tian-Jewish missions in general.
I "It was my wish to have been confronted
here with Rabbi Voorsanger," said Mr.
Weyler. "If I had not known that you
would be occupied with your regular order
of business 1 should have requested you to
desire the rabbi, to be present to confront
me. As it is I intend to meet Rabbi Voor
sanger in the near future and in the pres
ence of witnesses challenge him to prove
his statements."
The speaker said he had had nothing to
do with the "founding of the Christian-
Jewish Mission on Mission street, but
that Henry Chester, one of its originators,
had requested. him to speak there last
Tuesday week. He had come down from
Benicia at his own expense and had
done so.
"Rabbi Voorsanger says that each con
verted Jew has cost the Christian mis
sions $30,000. lam a converted Jew and I
never cost any mission 30 cents. On the
contrary, Christianity has cost me con
siderable.
"I repeatedly, almost obstinately, re
fused aid from educational societies dur
ing my divinity course at Knox College,
Galesburg, 111. I have never asked nor
received a cent for Jewish missions in my
life. During my college course I sup
ported myself by teaching."
The speaker concluded his statements
respecting himself by saying he had never
said he was a descendant of David, and
that if any one wanted to know more
about him he would gladly refer them to
President Harper of Chicago, the pro
fessors of Knox College, or to other Chris
tian divines and reputable Jews.
Referring to Rabbi Voorsanger's general
statements, he said : "The rabbi states that
there are two million Jews in America, and
only 130,000 in the synagogues. If tnat is
the case it shows that there are plenty of
Jews in need of missions. Surely it is not a
question of an Abrahamic face but an
Abrahamic faith that makes a Jew. Many
even of the Jews that belong to the syna
gogues are only Jews # by race, and not by
faith. The Jews to-day are thinking more
earnestly about Jesus, of Nazareth than
ever before, and while some of the converts
surely must be frauds, because Rabbi
Voorsanger says so, not all are frauds.
| "As to the right of Christians to do mis
sion work among the Jews, the Jew is
simply a soul like any one else, and as
Christians we owe more to the Jews than
to any other class of people, because of
their "gift to us of Christianity. The
Christian should go more than half way to
meet the Jew. The church needs Jewish
converts for their scholarship, especially
in Hebrew, and for their energy and faith.
I do not believe that a converted Jew ever
costs $30,000, but he is worth ii if he does.
As to Israel's strength, ' whatever the
rabbi's faith may be, we have the strength
of the living Cod. Suppose that the Jews
are too strong for us, we cannot fail in our
duty ; we have our orders to go out into all
the world and preach."
The speaker concluded by saving that he
had never allowed his name to be used in
connection with the San Francisco mis
sion. "But Ido not think my worK there
is done, and I will not cease from the
labor if Rabbi Voorsanger and all the
2,000,000 Jews were behind him."
At the conclusion of the address the
following resolution was unanimously
adopted: "We have heard with pleasure
the statement of our brother, and we
assure him that he has our support and
sympathy."
Rev. Dr. Wythe, who has just recovered
from a serious illness, was welcomed back
to the meeting with many demonstrations
of esteem and affection. Rev. J. J. Lewis,
former president of the New, Zealand con
ference, on his way to the Irish conference,
made a few remarks, in the course of
which .he said that New Zealand was in
the vanguard on the subjects oi social
purity and temperance as a consequence of
its having granted the franchise to women.
The statement was heartily applauded.
Presbyterian Ministers.
It was quiz day at the Presbyterian Min
isterial Association yesterday morning.
That is to say Rev. Jrj". R. Farrand pro
pounded questions and the ministers
present discussed and answered them.
"Is denominalizationism a greater good
than evil?" was the first question pro
pounded. The discussion was opened by
Rev. Dr. Ketchum, who believed in union,
but not uniformity.
The question that caused most de bate
was whether teachings of the Bible and
the church are opposed to paying interest
and rent. Rev. Owen Jones, who opened
the discussion, quoted texts from the
Bible condemning the taking of interest.
He said:
The views of Christ were given in the words,
"Lay not up treasure upon earth; sell that ye
have and give alms (land), hoping for it noth
ing again." The views of the church of Christ
through all the centuries were unanimous on
this matter. The fathers of the church, the
councils, the Popes ana the theologians of the
Reformation were also unanimous In con
demning the taking of interest. '
The philosophy of the subject was said to be
the following: The only way to get the pro
duce of nature is by labor. This is the law of
the Garden of Eden. Violations of this are
gambling, speculation and taking interest. No
man has a right by the law of God to sit down
idle. Every must work. No man has a
right to make other people work for > him,
which is always the case with laying out
money on interest.
Taking Interest is a transgression of the law
of the second table and causes a man to lose
an opportunity of showing kindness to his
fellow^ without being paid for It. Where is a
man to begin to give? This is the divine
privilege which God grants to men by prosper
ing their labor. Where is he to begin it?
After making a million by interest? No; but
the moment God has given him more than he
needs v -It he has the meanness to hire his
blessing again for money he .will fall by dead
weight into the class of covetous personscon
demned everywhere in scripture, y
. Rev. I. V. Scott upheld the views of
Rev. Owen Jones, but Rev. James Wood
worth said he considered it perfectly im
practicable to cut off interest. Such a
thing would close savings banks and won.
injury to working men. Dr. Minturn, Dr.
Bevier and Rev. E. L. Burnett also upheld
the system of paying interest.

THE ASSESSOR
AND GRAND JURY
Assessment Roll This Year
Will Show Large
Increase.
CIVIC FEDERATION WORK
Views of John Landers, Chairman
of the Committee ot
Grand Jurors.
HAS CONFIDENCE IN SIEBE.
Conservative Members of the Jury Op
posed to Communistic Raids on
Corporations.
â  : â  â  â  . ' :
Stewart Menzies, chairman of the as
sessment committee of the Civic Federa
tion, was chairman of the Finance Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors at the time
Assessor Rosener was removed from office
for misconduct. He holds steadfastly to
the opinion that it is the duty of the pres
ent Board of Supervisors, through its
Finance Committee, to see that lie As
sessor performs bis duty and docs not
allow valuable property to escape assess
ment. Mr. Menzies said:
The Finance Committee of the board has
power to investigate every department of the
municipal government, and it is also vested
with authority to act, if the fact is disclosed
that a public officer is not performing his
duties. In dealing with assessments grand
juries, as a rule, do not show much strength.
It may be that members are timid, fearing that
the Assessor will get back at them. Yes, I be
lieve that all kindsof valuable property should
be taxed, as the law directs.- The burden
placed on real estate is too heavy. Franchises,
stocks and securities belonging to corpora
tions should be assessed. For example, the
managers of the Spring Valley Water Company
go before the Hoard of .Supervisors and ask
that rates be established so as to permit them
to pay <> per cent interest on their investment
of $18,000,000 or $20,000,000. According to .
the same rule they should pay a tax on a like
valuation.
I. J. Truman of the Civic Federation
said:
Our information, derived from the report of j
Colonel Lambert, a capable expert, who made I
a thorough examination of the books of the i
Assessor's office, is to the effect that Assessor
Siebe is performing his duty. The expert was:
directed by the federation to make thorough '
Inquiries, and in the course of his examination I
he found discrepancies in valuation, and went
to Mr. Siebe for explanation. These discrep
ancies were explained to Mr. Lambert's
satisfaction.
Now, as to taxing franchises. Ido not think
there is much in it. The proper course to
pursue fa to tax the tangible property. If the
water company goes before the Board of
Supervisors and asks for the fixing of a rate
that will allow the corporation to pay interest
on $18,000,000 worth of property it is fair to ask
the corporation to designate the property. Let
the company say how much of this property is
in Alameda County, how much in San Mateo,
how much in Santa Clara and how much in
San Francisco. The company snould be taxed
then for all the property it owns. If it owns
property to the value of $18,000,000 it should
pay taxes to that amount.
Yesterday John Landers, chairman of
the Grand Jury committee on Assessor,
Auditor and Treasurer, in view of recent
newspaper articles on the subject of prop
erty assessments, accorded The Call an
interview. Mr. Landers did not speak for
the Grand Jury or his associates on the
committeeâ G. H. Umbsen and Theodore
P. Payneâ but spoke for himself. He j
said:
I am in favor of taxing all property in pro
portion to its value, ami I regard it as incon
sistent with equity that so heavy a burden
should rest on real estate as is now imposed, i
Just when we were on the mend the Board of
Supervisors gave the City a fearful blow in '
raising the tax levy from .*1 60 to $2 25. This i
single stroke did more to retard prosperity than
the long period of hard tines through which
we had just passed. You must understand
that one investing in property at first inquires.
"How much will the investment pay over and
above taxes, insurance and repairs?" When
Â£2 25 for taxes is placed against the account
of income the investment is rendered unde- '
sirable. A tax rate of this kind is almost a
crime. The present Grand .Jury, 1 believe, will
do all that men can do to have the Board of
Supervisors reduce estimates tor the next year
bo that this enormous tax on the people will
be diminished.
Now as for Assessor Siebe I have had several
Interviews with him and lie assures me, and I
lave confidence in his assurance, that per
sonal property assessments will be raised and
that much property of value that has hitherto
escaped taxation or has been assessed at a
very low figure will be listed for its actual
value.
I sec danger in the agitation for a radical de
parture in methods of assessments. We must
guard against communistic tendencies. You
would be surprised if you could read some of
the communistic communications which I
have received on the subject of assessing the
property of corporations. The radicals, if un
restrained, would confiscate the property of
banks and corporations. What we need now,
and what the Grand Jury is seeking through
the Assessor to accomplish, is the assessment
of all property, real and personal, liable under
the law for taxation. Beyond that we want
that which is of still greater importance, a re
duced levy on the increased valuation, so that
taxes may be brought down to a living figure.
Mr. Siebe told me a few days ago that lie would
Boon be ready to produce figures showing a
marked increase of the roll.
Now as to the assessment of the Spring Val
ley water corporation, which is so frequently
cited. The Assessor tells me that it pays t axes
now up to the top notch. It has property In
San Mateo, Alameda and Santa Clara conn
ties, as well as property in San Francisco.
Much of it is real tangible property, which can
be seen and reached by the Assessor. ; '
Personally I am not interested in the stock of
any corporation in this City. Some time
ago I sold my small holdings of Market
street Railway and Pacific Gas Im
provement stock. I am sure that it is not
fair to assess the stock of a corporation on the
basis of a few daily transactions. The value
will decline, as 1 was taught when only a few
shares were placed on the market. There
would be great depreciation if half the stock
of a corporation were offered for sale.
Corporations are taxed in many ways. For
example the Manhattan Life Insurance Com
pany of New York, which I represent on the
coast, pays a State tax for the Insurance Com
missioner, pays a quarterly license tax to the
city, pays personal property tax on furniture
and fixtures and is asses, ed for whatever bal
ance it may have in bank here on the first Mon
day in March. Other corporations are taxed in
the same measure.
It is true that capitalists conceal money
from the Assessor. A man having $50,000 in
a commercial bank may buy a bill of exchange
on New York a aay or two before the first
Monday of Marcn an* make oath that he has
no money on hand. A citizen may do this, if
he can square his conscience by SRving $1100.
It is done frequently. About the first Monday
in March the safe-deposit boxes are filled with i
coin. At the sub-treasury coin is exchanged
for greenbacks; so that the Assessor cannot
trace the money. Corporations having central
offices in New York make up their cash bal
ance on the Saturday preceding the first Mon
day In March and send all the money on hand
to the home office. Admitting all this to be
true, it will not justily a campaign of com
munism. We must proceed with prudence
and conservative judgment to correct the evils
existing. Nothing is to be gained by sensa
tional agitation. The Call is assurea that the
Grand Jury in this important matter is guided
by a profound sense of duty to the people of
San Francisco.

his attorneys are in the City to-day to hie

DEMAND BY A LUNATIC.
He Wanted Seven Thousand Dol

lor Detective Work.
Discovered an Imaginary Murderer, and
Was S.nt to the Ukiah
Insane Asylum.
A man of middle age, evidently of Ger
man descent, walked into the City and
County Treasurer's office yesterday morn
ing, and in a matter-of-fact way remarked
to Deputy Treasurer Montanya:
"I have a claim of $7000 against the City
which I would like to collect."
The man held a piece of paper folded in
his hand, and Mr. Montanya, seeing that
he made no effort to hand over the paper,
inquired as to the particulars.
"Well," replied the man, "I. am a de
tective, and I have discovered a man who
murdered thirteen persons seven men
and six women, j I want $200 in cash and a
check on the German. Savings Bank for
$0300." . .
Policeman Wagner, who has been
specially assigned to duty in the Treas
urer's office and the corridor, saw that the
visitor was insane, and fearing that the
man might have a weapon on "his person
took him into custody. He subjected him
to a cross-examination, which fortified
him in his belief that the man was a luna
tic. He accordingly took] the man to
Judge Hebbard's- court, where he was ad
judged insane by the Commissioners on
Insanity, and was committed toy the
Asylum for the Insane at Ukiah.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1896.
IS THIS RADFORD
OR RANDOLPH?
The Man From Virginia
Who Registered Here
March, 1895.
SAILED FOR COLOMBIA.
â i
Now in Prison for Killing a
Prominent Citizen of That
Republic.
A MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED.
Asserted Again to Be Judge Randolph
Who Absconded From Alabama
With $40,000.
The mystery is still unsolved, whether
the American who Killed C. H. Simmonds
in the republic of Colombia is F. C. Ran
dolph, the absconding Probate Judge of
Montgomery, Alabama, or Charles Rad
ford of Virginia. The mystery will be
solved when to-day's Call reaches Mont
gomery, Alabama, or some resident of
that region who was familiar with Judge
Randolph. The photograph reproduced
in connection with this article is that of
the man who arrived in San Francisco,
March 21, 1895, and registered at the Cali
fornia Hotel as /"Charles Radford, Vir
ginia." There is no mistake on this point.
The photograph was quickly recognized
last evening as a picture of Radford by
the chief clerk of the hotel.
The following letter, received yesterday
by the Consul of Colombia, relates to Rad
ford or Randolph's record : -: y;
Repup.lica de Colombia 1

--?: '---' . Call, February 5, 1896. J
Consul of Colombia, (fan Francisco, Catâ Dear
Sir: Your esteemed favor No. 03 of October 16.
1895. To-day I inclose you photo of Charles
Radford, accused of the assassination of C. H.
Simmonds. in order that you may ascertain
whether the party we have as prisoner, under
the above name, is the same as known in your
City, and also whether the three checks founa
in Radford's possession, drawn by, the Crocker-
Wool worth National Bank of San Francisco,
March 25, 1895, on Union Bank of London,
England, numbered 1833, 1838 and 1839, for
Â£250 each, are genuine. â¢ -yy---;
It appears from publications made by the
press of the United States, received in this
city, that the real name of Radford is Francisco
C. Randolph, formerly occupying the position
of Probate Judge in Montgomery, Ala., and
who disappeared from the latter place with a
large sum of money. â  I have been informed
that the World of New York of November 29,
1895, has published an article on this matter.
Kindly send newspapers containing articles
on this matter, and telegraph me under ad
dress "Prefecto, Call," in the words "yes" or
"no" if the photo of Radford corresponds with
the appearance of man known in San Fran
cisco with that name. ,
I also send fac-simile of signatures of Rad
ford, as same appear on above-mentioned
checks.
In the hope of receiving prompt information,
I beg to remain very respectfully,
Fortunato Garces P.
A newspaper extract here following was
contained in the letter:
Extract from La Estrella de Panama. Dale,
February 27, 1890.
We have . received by mail the following
dispatch, dated Cali, February 20, 1896: ;
"From active investigation made by the
court of this city it has been clearly shown by
the results that Charles - Radford, the assassin
of the much-beloved V. H. Simmonds, is Fran
cisco c. Randolph. The marks on -his linen
and signatures to papers found among his ef
fects show this to be his correct name and ini
tials. Randolph, according to the testimony
of San Francisco papers, is the absconded
Judge of Mr jtgomery, Ala., who disappeared
with the sum of !Â£40,000 In order to travel
around the earth looking for adventures and
concluded that he would not be found out in
this country. ÂHe made, however, a mistake.
The case of Radford-Randolph is already cele
brated and from it will yet result dramas more
or less bloody. â¢ The Correspondent.

The man whose picture is here given be
came acquaintel with General R. â __.'. War
field in the; smoking compartment of a
Pullman car coming from Los Angeles to
this: City, March 21, 1895. There were
others in the party, who slisnSfied a desire
to go with General Warfield to the CalL
forma as the train neared i San Francisco,
and so Radford of Virginia, who had made
himself known as as ex-officer of the Con
federate army, indicated his desire also to
go to the California. He was under the
influence of liquor, but able, like the
Virginia gentleman of the old school, to
maintain his dignity under such a trying
ordeal. He had a large sum of money
with him, which General Warfield insisted
should he placed in the safe. : The sum
was stated to be $10,000, and much of it
was gold coin.
I Radford proceeded to enjoy himself in
San Francisco. The "influence" which he
brought to town was elevated rather than
diminished during the first two days of
sojourn. In one of his rambles he was
robbed of $300, but this did not diminish
his desire for metropolitan diversion. ..
, When he braced up to start for Col
ombia he was about to take his bag of
money aboard the steamer. Then Gen
eral Warfield interfered and said : "Here,
Bradford, you are not going away from
here carrying so large a sum of money in
that fashion. You" will go around with
me and buy London exchange. The re
cord of the exchange can be held here to
your order if anything happens." The
drafts on London were bought as the fore
going letter indicates and Radford went
away in fairly good shape.
The next that General Warfield heard of
Radford was by letter"written by the lat
ter in prison. The killing of Simmonds
was acknowledged, but Radford declared
it was done in self-defense. General War
field was urged to notify Mr. Herbert, Sec
retary of the Navy, that his (Herbert's) old
friend Radford was in trouble and needed
assistance. The Secretary was so notified.
A few weeks prior to this time a report
had reached the United States that the
slayer of Simmonds was F. C. Randolph,
the former Probate Judge of Montgomery,

TOOK CARBOLIC ACID.
Wife of a Fillip ore- Street Car Con-
ductor Commits Suicide.
Mary Blame, the wife of Robert J. Blame
of 1522 Turk street, a streetcar conductor
on the Fillmore-street line, was found dead
in bed Sunday night at 7:30 o'clock by her
husband.
Beside her was a glass that had contained
carbolic acid. Dr. Blake was called in and
pronounced the cause of her death to have
been the acid.
Blame can assign no reason for the deed.
He stated that she had been drinking
heavily all the day before, and had proba
bly come home intoxicated.
Blame is popular -among his brother
workers, who sympathize strongly with
him. His wife was a native of Ireland and
27 years of age. She leaves two children.

THE ARCHITECT.
Delay in the Construction
of the New Postoffice
Building.
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
The Postmaster Submitted His
Ideas of Changes in the
Plans.
HE RESENTS ALL CRITICISM.
Declares the Drawings of the Archi
tect for Interior Arrangements
Were Fau ty.
Postmaster McCoppin declines to en
large his responsibilities by assuming
credit for the long delay in the commence
ment of work on the new postoffice build
ing. In a dispatch to The Call from
Washington it was stated that the super
vising architect was awaiting his ideas as
to how the rooms devoted to the postoffice
in the proposed structure at Mission and
Seventh streets should be arranged. Mr.
McCoppin said yesterday that he had al
ready communicated his views to the
architect at Washington and would have
nothing more to do with the matter.
"The plans were here a year or more
ago, but they were not submitted to me,"
said Postmaster McCoppin, "nor was I in
vited to look at them, and I do not now
even recall the name of the person in
whose hands they were at the time. Later
on the architect, Mr. Aiken, was here, and
though I saw something of him in a social
way. he did not show me his plans nor
talk to me about them.
"But about two months ago he sent a
sketch of the plan of the ground floor of
the postoffice, with a request that I make
any suggestions regarding changes that
might occur to me. I made several. They
were of a radical nature and concerned the
interior arrangements, and I also wrote
him fully on the subject.
"I can furnish The Call a copy of the
letter at any time. It was so plain that a
schoolboy could understand it, and was
accompanied by a drawing with the
changes suggested.
"Later I saw that the architect had
given out to The Call correspondent at
Washington that he did not understand
fully the Postmaster's suggestions, and
that he had called upon him again to go
over the ground.
"He sent out another sketch plan, differ
ent from the first, but equally faulty in
the opfnion of the Postmaster. It was
promptly returned, accompanied by a let
ter which was intended to further enlighten
the architect on the subject of the post
office as to ground plan and the worKing
utilities of the office. Therefore, the archi
tect, or whoever has assumed the
right to speak for him, has no right to
pretend that the Postmaster has been the
cause of any delay in the perfection of the
working plans for the building."
This i_ all the Postmaster would say on
the subject, though it was quite evident
from his manner that he was anything but
pleased with the criticism of his conduct
sent out from the chief architect's depart
ment at Washington. He is as anxious as
anj' person in San Francisco to see work
begun on the building, but does not ex
pect to live to 6ee the big building com
pleted unless the good Lord gives him a
onger lease of life than he has ever before
allotted to any of his creatures.
An equally ridiculous statement emanat
ing from the architect's office at Washing
ton is the one attributed to a certain Fed
eral Judge, who, so the story goes, had de
manded that the plans be changed, or he
would not move into the new building.
This statement can only apply to Judge
McKenna or Judge Morrow, and the fact
is that they, like the Postmaster, have
done everything in their power to facili
tate matters rather than to obstruct the
plana of the architect. b'b
The belief is pretty general in Federal
circles that Representative Loud hit the
nail on the head when he said in an inter
view with the Washington correspondent
of The Call that the reason why the Gov
ernment did not proceed with the work
was on account of the absence of ready
cash.
The Congressional delegation at Wash
ington is doing everything iD its power
to advance the enterprise, but little
aid is hoped for from those having the
construction of the building in charge.
VITICULTURAL COLLEGE.'
Tho Sew Institution Branching Out on
Broad Progressive Lines.
The College of Viticulture is branching
out, and before long will be as well known
as the late .State Board of Viticulture, from
which it sprang. Yesterday the trust3es
of the college met at 16 Post street and
discussed matters pertaining to its future
course. .
There were present: A. Haraszthy, C. A.
Wetmore, H. W. Crabb, John Swett and
Winhela Scott. Arrangements have been
made for permanent Quarters in the State
Board of Trade's rooms, at 16 Post street,
and the college will co-operate with the
board in advertising the Stale. It will also
assist in the preparation for the grand
opening of the headquarters next month.
In a short time there will be 100 con
tributing members to the college. These
have been and will be elected by the trus
tees, who will use every precaution to see
that no designing or undesirable persons
are allowed to become members. Among
other features to be introduced will be a
journal in which viticultural matters will
be published. It will be issued on a pure
ly scientific basis, and no current news
will appear in its columns.
Recording Secretary \Vetmore was in
structed to prepare suitable resolutions in
respect to the memory of the late I. de
Turk of Sonoma and Colonel Charles
McK. Lesor, publisher of Bonfort's Wine
and Spirit Circular of New York.
Thomas R. .Mint urn of 'Minturn. Madera
County, was elected to fill the vacancy as
trustee caused by the death of I. de Turk.
PERCY SMITH'S DEATH.
An Examination of thÂ« Stomach Shows
It Wai From Natural Cauaei.
From a chemical analysis of the stomach
of the late Percy W. Smith, the drug
clerk at St. Luke's Hospital, who died
suddenly on March 14, it was shown that
lie died from angina pectoris, an affection
of the nerves of the heart.
Smith's death was so sadden that the
Coroner, with the consent of the family, ,
made an investigation, and the result
showed what his friends had always be
lieved, that death was from natural causes.
Smith was a young man full of lifts and
vigor, and his taking off was a great shock
to his family. He leaves a wife and child
to mourn bis loss.
FOUR YEARS OR TWO.
The Tenure of Office of Election Comm
issioners Again Under
Discussion.
Mayor Sutro was present at the meeting \
of the Board of Election Commissioners
yesterday morning. The meeting was
one of the humdrum kind and was not :
enlivened by any references to the Octo
pus or to a City Hall ring.
After come discussion the board de
cided to advertise for bids for registration
supplies.
In the course of the discussion Mr. Cres
well expressed the opinion that the law
creating four-year terms for County offi
cers should be tested and determined be
fore the board should incur any more
than ordinary expense. There was a ques
tion as to whether the law applied to San
Francisco. He suggested that the regis
trar should be ordered to advertise for
supplies and booths for the election of all
the City and County officers. Then some
one should apply for a writ of injunction,
and the matter could be settled judicially.
George >'. Martin, Who Was Ejected From a Southern Pacific. Train Because the
Conductor Did Not Approve of His Handwriting.
The speaker added that if the law ex- '
tending the terms of County officers to
four years applied to San Francisco it in
cluded all under the wording:
"All elective county and township" offi
cers, and the Supreme Court had decided
that San Francisco was a county.
He moved that Garret McEnerney be
employed to take the matter before" the
courts. Mayor Sutro suggested that Judge
McKinstry be employed to serve as the at
torney of the board during the registration
period at $500 per month.
Both motions were voted down.
Then Mr. Creswell sharply gave notice
that he would vote against all expenditures
until the question was settled, because he
would be personally responsible for all
moneys expended illegally by the board.
Auditor Broderick did not believe that
the law applied to San Francisco, and he
did not think that the board could get a
decision from the Supreme Court before
the beginning of registration.
Here the discussion was dropDed, and
the clerk was authorized to advertise for
bids for supplies.
Left for the East.
E. A. Whitaker, general agent of the Minne
apolis and St. Louis Railroad, and who repre
sents the interests of the Chicago, Rock Island
and Pacific system at St. Paul, is visiting this

tour of Southern California before returning

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1896.
THEY FLOCK TO TESTIFY.
Witnesses Hurry to the Relief
of the Railroad in the
Martin Case.
PAY THEIR OWN EXPENSES
Some Were S?nt Passes With Not So
Much as a Request to
Attend.
The case of George N. Martin against the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company held
the attention of Judge Daingerfield and a
jury all day yesterday. Tne witnesses
were all for the railroad. There was Mr.
Weston, the conductor who put the
plaintiff off the train at Towles station on
the 2d of August last, and who is still in
the employ of the railroad company.
There was Mr. Towle, who owns the hotel
at Towles station, and who is engaged in
the lumber business there and ships a
great deal of freight over the road. There
was Mr. Shell, who is engaged in the malt
ing business at Sacramento. He was a
passenger on the train at time of the oc
currence. He does a great deal of freight
ing over the road also. There was John
Manson, a physician, who is engaged in
the hospital department of the railroad at
Towles. He is also engaged in the fruit
business and does shipping.
There were Mrs. Dr. Mauson and R. N.
Manson. a son of Dr. Manson. The son i 3
engaged in fruit-drying at Lincoln station.
All of these happened to be at the station
at Towles when the conductor put Martin
off the train, all of them saw that Martin
was lame and gave it as their opinionâ
but the conductor and Shell â that he had
stopped there for his health. They were
unanimous on the point that there was no
show of physical force oh the part of the
conductor in putting him off the train, but
on the contrary that he assisted Martin
across the tracks toward the railroad
station. â¢ Â»
Then there was Mr. Roos of the passen
ger department of the railroad, a part of
whose business it is to smooth the way
between the company and its injured and
disaffected patrons. He testified that he
had offered Mr. Martin, when he came to
him and explained what he Pad suffered
at the hands of the conductor, $50 and a
new ticket to his destination: in 'Sioux
City with Pullman sleeping-car accommo
dations if he (Martin) would call it square.
Mr. Knight, also of the passenger de
partment, testified to unimportant mat
ters.
Conductor Weston told a plain enough
story. He had asked Martin to write bis
name and the signature did not agree with
that on the ticket. He allowed him to
ride some time and got him to write it
again, and still again, but the name was
still unlike that on the ticket. Then he
told Martin that he could; not accept .the
ticket and unless he paid his fare he
would have to leave the train. Martin,
he said, called attention to the fact that
he was- a sick man and asked not to be
put off at an out of the way
station. He said if allowed to go on to
Truckee he could secure identification, as
he had done business with the Truckee
Lumber Company. The conductor asked
Martin if he would make any less resist
ance to being put off the train at Truckee
than at any other point, and Martin in
sisted that he would object to being off
at any place short of his destination for
which he had bought his ticket. "I then
insisted that he get off the train at
Towles," said the witness. He stated that
he had used no force, but assisted Martin
across the track.
The cross-examination of the other wit
nesses by Mr. Delmas developed points of
interest. For instance, Mr. Towle, pro
prietor of the hotel at Towles station and a
umber-dealer, testified that he had been
supplied with a pass by J. A. Fillmore,
with a request that he come to San Fran
cisco as a witness in this case. He was
engaged in the lumber business and had
considerable business with the company
as a freighter.
'â¢ Does the company pay your expenses
on this trip?" asked Mr. Delmas.
"No, sir, I pay my own expenses."
Mr. Shell, engaged in the malting busi
ness at Sacramento, who was on the train
and had to say that the conductor used no
physical violence upon the lame man,
made the same statement. He had come
to the City on passes furnished him by the
company four times on this case. He
paid his own expenses all the time he said.
He does a large freighting business with
the company.
Dr. John Manson, practicing physician
for twenty-nine years, who has something
to do with the railroad hospital, also fruit
_ rower and shipper, came on passes to
testify and with his wife has been in the
City since the 2d of March paying his own
expenses.
R. X. Manson, the doctor's son, received
a telegram from Mr. Fillmore, saying:
"This telegram, properly countersigned by
the station agent, will be a warrant to all
conductors to pass R. N. Manson to San
Francisco, as witness in the Martin case."
Mr. Manson is engaged in the fruit-dry
ing business at Lincoln, but this telegram
was suffictent to cause him to take the
next train for this city. Arrived here he
found tbe case postponed, and hastened
back to his business. Again summoned,
he responded. He is paying. his own ex
penses like the others.
The trial will be resumed this morning.
THE EIGHT-HOUft LAW.
The Harbor Comuiioiouer Investigates
State Work on the Water Front. ,' j
'Unless Contractors Galloway & Townley
change their plans .they -will be likely to
lock horns with Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald. These contractors have received a
contract from the Harbor Commissioners
to construct a shed over the pier at the foot
of Howard street. Yesterday Business
Agent Saunders called at the Labor Bu
reau and informed Beputy C. L. Dam that
the contractors propose to work the car
centers and other laborers nine hours a
day, which would be in violation of the
State law, which makes eight hours a le
gal day's work. ,y. .; . â¢'â -. -. Â
Saunders and Dam called upon Mr.
Townley, who stated that he does not pro
pose to pay the men by the day but by the
hour, and that the men may quit worts
whenever they desire. However, he had
figured upon doing nine hours' work in a
day. Saunders claimed that this is only
| an evaaion of the law, because in the con
| tract the following clause apnears:
And it is expressly stipulated that eight
hours of labor shall be a legal day's work un
der this agreement, and all the provisions of
i Chapter X, Titla VII, of the Political Coae ap
| plicable thereto are to be deemed as incor
â¢ porated herein. \ *
Deputy Dam took the same view of the
j situation ana said that when the work
i really begins, probably to-day, he will see
that the spirit of the law is enforced. If
| the contractors work their men more than
j eight hours the Labor Commissioner will
: apply to the Board of Harbor Commis
; sioners to interfere on the ground that the
; hours of labor appear in the specifications
and contract. Should there be any hitch
j there the matter will be taken into court
| and the Harbor Commissioners enjoined
i from paying any money upon a State con
] tract the terms of which are not carried
i out in letter and spirit. It is the desire of
the Labor Commissioner to make a test
'. case of this or some similar case, as there
! are a number of outstanding State con
; tracts where, it is rumored, the contrac
! tors propose to work the men over eight
j hours, labor unions, State law and com
| missioners notwithstanding.
Stealing Front Boarders.
The boarders in the Chamberlain House,
Sutter and Jones streets, had been missing
jewelry and other articles from their rooms,
and the police were notified. Detective Harry
Reynolds was detailed on the case, and last
night he arrested Joe Sanborn, the elevator
boy,- on suspicion of being the thief. Several
hundred dollars' worth of jewelry and clothing
have been stolen.
DANGER IN WATEK.
Why People ' Should Be Careful What
They Drink, Especially at This
Time of Year. .
"Do you know that there is a dangerous
poison in half the water we drink?"
It was an eminent professor of natural sci
ence who recently made this startling remark.
"I am only stating a fact," he continued,
"when I assert that in the springtime nearly
all our drinking water contains traces of poi
sonous vegetable or animal matter. We drink
this water, the poison gets into our system,
and it is largely the cause of so many people
feeling weak, worn out and sickly at this sea
son.
"Do I recommend boiling the water ? No, I
do not, for while that may kill the disease
germs.it does not remove them. A far better
way is to use Dure whiskey with it. The best
physicians in America unhesitatingly declare
this, . butâ and bear this most carefully in
mmd â must be pure whiskey, for impure
impure whiskey is worse than water."
The professor is certainly right, and he
might have appropriately added that scientific
men are also fully agreed that no whiskey used
in America to-day is so chemically pure, so
free from fusel oil, as Duffy's pure malt. It
has successfully stood the rivalry of all other
whiskies. Why? Simply because it Has done
wonders for people who needed strength,! vigor
and vitality. Thousands testify to the great
benefit derived from taking it. Leading phy
sicians say it is undoubtedly the best thing for
counteracting the evil eflects of poisonous
water. They also indorse it as the best remedy
for tired feelings and spring weakness. As
there are many inferior imitations of Duffy's
pure malt, care should be taken when pur
chasing to see that none of these is substituted
by the dealer.

NE.V YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 12.â Operators at the
Stock Exchange were inclined to take a more I
hopeful view of the situation to-day, owing to ad
vices from Washington relative to the attitude of
the administration on the Cuban question and the
belief that Congress ill adjourn at an earlier date
than has been expected. Incidentally the ease in
money, the fact that the foreign exchanges have
recently yielded under a pressure of commercial
and loan bills and the satisfactory earnings re
ported by many roads have had the effect of stimu
lating the bullish .ling with an entire absence of
excitement, and on a moderate volume of trans
actions the market ruled strong at a higher range
of quotations throughout the session.
Ihe Industrials were the real leaders. A further
advance of l-16Â®ysc on all grades of refined sugar
imparted fresh interest to speculation in sugar

CHICAGO MARKETS.
rHTCAOO, In., April 13.â There were some
belated holders of wheat who had to sell out this
morning and the consequences were prices de
clined under the operation. The bulls were look
ing around for some new and plausible argument
on which to base a rise, now that the Government
report proved so disastrous. The visible supply
figures afforded no encouragement, the indications
being that the decrease would be a moderate one
and the final result confirming the belief. It
showed 992,000 bushels reduction for the week.
Kansas and the winter wheat belt generally had
abundant moisture in the last few days..
The opening of the market.was steady, but that
feeling lasted only temporarily, the recessions
already mentioned taking place during the first
fifteen minutes. Liverpool cables were weak and
lower. Receipts in the Northwest were 379 cars
against 376 last Monday and 179 a year ago.
Chicago received 10 cars and inspected out 199,
--518 bushels. The world's shipments for the week
were moderate at 4,460,000 busliels.
The amount on ocean travel decreased 480,000
bushels, and the English visible supply 1,170,000
bushels. Shorts covered after the early decline
had taken place, prices working upward on the
demand. Export clearances were 281,709 bushels,
Closing Continental cables were irregular. The
close was quite strong, reports of sales at Duluth
for shipment assisting in producing a better feel
ing. May Wheat opened from 64S/ 8 to b'4y 2 c. sold
between 64 and 65y 2 c, closing at the outside %C
higher than Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-
morrow curs. â¢ . > i . ;.-;'â¢ :.â  s
CORNâ The week begah In corn under very
much the same conditions that prevailed in the
immediate past. .No important or valuable in
formation bearing directly on the market appeared
and trade naturally turned to wheat for motive.
Receipts were 171 cars and 95,013 bushels were
taken from store. Liverpool cables were quiet and
unchanged. The visible supply decreased 142,000
bushels and the amount on ocean nassr.ge 320,000
bushels. May corn opened at 2P5/ B e. advanced to
30' âKj3oi/4C. closing at /B e, 3 /sÂ®%c higher than
Saturday.. Estimated receipts ior to-morrow 210
cars.
OATSâ neither remarkably active nor
strong. Opening was steady. Prices suffered some
through the weakness of wheat. Receipts were 139
cars and 38,600 bushels were taken from store.
The visib c supply increased 230,000 bushels.
Toward the close prices firmed with those of
wheat. May closed y^<S) s c higher. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 240 cars.
FLAXâ Firm. Cash, 91c; May, 88Â®88V_c; Sep
tember, 82% c. Receipts were 15 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The very light business in pro
visions was transacted with due consideration for.
weak wheat prices and a decline of 6Â®loc in live
hog values. After the early trading was over
steadiness prevailed. At the close May pork, lard
and ribs were each 2V_c under Saturday.

Major Tremain'g Gallantry.
Major Henry E. Tremainof the Seventy
third New York Volunteers, was a staff
officer, serving under General Daniel E.
Sickles, but at the battle of Resaca, Ga.. he
volunteered to assist General Butterfield
in a charge. It was during this charge
that the brigade of Coburn began firing by
mistake into the brigade commanded^ by
(Colonel) Harrison, afterwards President
of the United States. It was due in a
measure to Major Tremain's presence of
mind and courage that a panic among the
Federals was prevented. He rode in front
of Coburn's Command, and General Butter
field and General Sickles both testify that
they saw him with his sword knock down
tne guns of nearly all the men in the front
line of one regiment to stop them firing.
Major Tremain's gallantly at Chancellors
ville, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg was
also conspicuous, and General Sickles says
of him in his reports that "he is worthy of
the highest honor which the Government
can award." â From the "War Record."

Equestrian Statues.
"Washington lias for years led all other
cities of the world in the matter of eques
trian statues," said a well-known artist
who has been an extensive traveler, "and
the Hancock statue increases that lead.
That of Jackson in Lafayette square started
the artists in the equestrian line, General
Washington comes next, and he was fol
lowed by Generals Scott; McPherson and
Thomas and General Greene in East Wash
ington. Against our exhibit Vienna comes
next, with rive. Paris has but three eques
trians. Antwerp and several other cities
of Europe content themselves with but
one each." Washington Tost. . , â¢.

At the first meeting only Trustees Beck
and Feidler were in favor of complying j
with the petition, and Trustees Sella, !
Mitchell and Fletcher voted against it. j
Lir.ce then another meeting was held, and
after hearing a little of the law regarding
the value and significance of signatures i
to a petition, the Trustees were brought in
line, and the vote was unanimous when |
the matter was taken up at the last meet- |

Much honest difference of opinion exists J
regarding the expediency of incorporating j
SKETCHES OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND HOMES AT LIVERMORE.
as a city of the sixth class. The majority, I
however, favor the move, but as it will take j
a two-thirds vote the issue is at present in ;
doubt. The incorporators declare that
their numbers are gradually increasing, 1
and that before the election the result will
be a certainty.
R. W. Ellis is one of the leading advo
cates of the movement, and he sees in it '
more than the mere investing of the
Trustees with a little additional power.
"Liver-note is all right if she will but i
think so," he said yesterday. "Her peo- j
ple are generous, public-spirited and am
bitious. I disagree with the people who i
think that we are not smart enough to j
trust ourselves as a city of the sixth class, j
1 am aware that there rfre gentlemen here j
whose judgment commands respect who
hold it is not wise to make this change.
Their position is that the town is not
ready for it, that the moral stamina and
average intelligence are not high enough
to justify, the experiment. The logic of j
their argument is not that the charter is
unworthy of the town, but that the town !
is unfit for the charter. Ihe old charter
standi fcr the silurianism of the past.
It does not fit the new Livermore, toward
which the State is turning more and more
Its attention. There are current many
wrong notions as to the effect of the pro
posed change. Some think that reincor
poration is the same thing as bonding.
They declare that if the scheme carries the
town will be immediately swamped with
debt Â»nd taxes. All these ideas will be
thoroughly exploded and exploited before
the ejection." ' â  *_
1-h.t'K ON TUG GRADE.
Pleasure-Seekers Come-to Grief Return
ing From the Moraga Valley.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 13.â A party
consisting of Mr. and Mrs. John C. Rogers
and their three children, Frank Sanders of
Berkeley and Mrs. Rogers' sister, Miss
Emma Linguist of Adeline street, Oak
land, were wrecked on the grade between
this city and the Moraga Valley Sunday
afternoon. The brake of their conveyance
cave way and the horses became unman
ageable, when the kingbolt broke and
dumped the whole load out into the road.
Rogers was dragged 100 feet and tightly
wedged under the wagon. He was badly
j bruised, but escaped serious injury. Mrs.
j Rogers and children all escaped without
| broken bones as did Sanders. Miss Lin
| guist was picked up unconscious and re-
I mained so until she was brought to Dr. B.
T. Mouser's residence in Temescal. She
received a slight concussion of the brain, j
and the physician says some of her ribs [
! are broken. .- |
The fleeing horses ran into and demol
j ished another wagon further down the hill,
! but the occupants all escaped injury. The
| injured were all brought as far as Temescal
i by the Olsen brothers, who had also been
i out for the day.
DR. COYLE CORRECTS.
He Was Pastor of the Church Where
Ingt-rsoll Lectured.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 13.â There was
an error in the published report of Colonel
Ingersoll's Chicago speech in this morn
| ing's papers, and Rev. Dr. Coyle supplies
! the correction. The report stated that the
j Church Militant, before which Ingersoll
: spoke, was composed of "the major portion
; of the former adherents of the Fullerton
; avenue Presbyterian Church."
"This is not correct," said Dr. Coyle. 'T
. was for six years pastor of the Fuilerton
avenue Church before coming out here. ;
; and am very familiar with the matter. I \
j was also back there two years ago. In- !
I stead of the major portion of ray old
church going to the Church Militant, only â 
I ten members went and not one more. As I
j the membership is many hundreds the
: secession did not really count. The
| Church Militant was composed of mem
j bers from many other bodies."
MAY CHANGE POTTER.
: Electricity May Be Substituted for
Steam Without a Local Franchise.
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 13.â The steam
railroads of the State may at any time
change their motive power to electricity i
J without first oftaining franchises from
j local authorities. That was the opinion of
j District Attorney Snook, rendered to the
! Supervisors to-day. It was brought out |
'. by the desire of the board to know just j
j how far the Laundry Farm had a right to |
| make the change. Within the corporate !
: limits of towns and cities of over 5000 pop- j
i ulation, however, the permission of the j
. governing bodies must first be secured.
A FATAL FALL.
I J, Degerter Misses His Footing on a |
Rickety Windmill.
OAKLAND. Cal.. April 13.â J. F. De- j
'â  gerter fell from a windmill tank at 1169 i
' Seventh street this afternoon and died j
' this evening. The tank is the same that !
fell to pieces Saturday and seriously in- I
, jured Mrs. Pipenberg, who was standing
beneath. Degerter was employed to take j
down the rickety structure to-day. and j
while doing so he fell and was hurt" inter- j
nally. He was attended by Dr. Hunting
ton.but he never rallied, and died to- j
| night. He fell a distance of thirty-two !
| feet.
The deceased was a widower, about 45
years old, and leaves two children.
New Trial Denied.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 13.â When the
case of Benjamin L. Hill, convicted of
murder in the first degree for the killing
of his wife, was called this afternoon for
sentence, his attorney, Thomas Bradley,
made a motion for a new trial on account
of errors occurring during the trial, but
after more than an hour's argument it was
denied. The passing of sentence went
over until the latter part of the week.
MAY SUE THE CITY.
Money Paid Illegally for Tears to the
Police Court for Felony Ex
aminations.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 13.â District At
torney Snook advised the Board of Super
visors to-day that under existing laws the
Police Judge of the city, in the examina- :
tion of felony cases, as committing magis
trate, is not entitled to extra compensa
tion from the county, and says that it is
evident all costs occasioned by offenses
committed within the charter limits of the
city of Oakland should be paid by the city l
and not by the county.
This will result in a large saving to tne
county, as the fee is $3 in each examina
tion, which in the past has been allowed
to the extent of many thousand dollars. j
A bill for $153, covering the six months |
ending December 31, 1895, was rejected. \
County Expert Fred A. Davis recom- j
mended that a statement of the full j
amount paid out in this way be prepared
and submitted to the District Attorney,
who, if he sees fit, shall begin suit to re- j
cover the amount from the city of Oak- j
land. This was adopted and Davis ordered
to prepare the statement.
LEFT WITHOUT FOOD.
Mrs. Jorgensen's Story of Shocking
Neglect and Treatment.
. OAKLAND, Cal., April 13.â Mrs. Eliza
beth Jorgensen has filed suit for divorce
from Peter Jorgensen and in her complaint
tells a story of most shocking neglect. She
charges cruelty, desertion and failure to
provide. The couple live in the hills about
two miles back of Dublin and have 480
acres of land valued at about $5000.
He lets his land lie idle and works for
wages. For a year past he has refused to
provide for his family, leaving them almost
destitute. When the last child was born
he refused to provide nurse or doctor, leav
ing his wife alone with one of the children
and did not return for three months.
Mrs. Jorgensen is informed that her
husband some time ago received
$10,000 from relatives in Germany, which
he has put away, and refuses to give her a
dollar. .The parties have four children,
the oldest 10 and the youngest 5 years.
Herrings breed in the Arctic Ocean, and
in April and May pass in immense shoals,
through the British seas, followed by
fishes and birds of prey. The Docgerbank,
in the North Sea, 190 miles long, is the
favorite resort of these, and of turbot, cod,
soles, etc. *-'â } â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 1896.
WAGNER TIRES THE COURT
The Step- Father of the Boy
Burglar Can Support His
Second Wife.
HIS LITTLE ONES DESTITUTE.
The Clever Manner in Which He Was
Aided by His Opponent's Wit
nesses.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. April 13. C
James A Wagner has succeeded in tir
ing out Judge Wood, and when his case
comes up again he will be released from
further attendance on the court. Wagner
is the step-father of Abe Majors, one of the
boy safe-crackers who made so much his- i
ton* in a short time a few weeks ago.
Mrs. Wagner, who secured a divorce !
from her husband for cruelty several j
years ago, had him arrested several !
months ago for not supporting his two j
young children. For several years she |
lost sight of Wagner, nor did she learn of j
i his whereabouts until she saw that he had
I taken out a marriage license to wed again. !
He was brought to Oakland prison two j
days after bis marriage and was released
for a month to see what he would do. At
the end of the month it was the same old I
story and Wagner was again confined for I
! a day or two. This was continued for sev- I
j eral times and Wagner always told the !
I same pitiful story. He was sick; he was |
j canvassing for photographs and his income i
' was small, and as he had a home he would i
i like to look after the children himself.
A few weeks ago Wagner turned the j
| tables on his wife's witnesses. He learned
I several of their addresses and made it his j
business to call at their houses and solicit \
business. The unusual proceeding caused j
no great amount of surprise till all the j
! parties were in court. \V agner's attorney !
I then questioned the witnesses on Wagner's i
i behalf, and they were forced to acknowl- |
; edge that they knew of their own knowl- |
j edge that Wagner had made efforts to get ;
! work. Of course this was good evidence j
I and was accepted.
Mrs. Wagner is now in the deepest pov- !
; erty and distress, as her son who helped to '
â¢ support her is in San Quentin. Sheriff â¢
White has driven the wolf from the door
| on several occasions, and the Supervisors j
; have been asked to aid, but the broken- j
hearted woman persists in keeping her j
two young children and is not comforta- j
ble if they are out of her sight.
"I cannot do any more with that man
Wagner," saia Judge Wood. "He is not
strong. He is tricky and has no business.
I This is a case in which the law can afford
Ino relief. He makes a showing each time
| he is here, and although he is morally and
legally bound to support his children it is j
' impossible for a Judge to draw blood from
a stone. It does not benefit anybody keep- j
ing him In jail, for then he only makes j
two families miserable. The order for per- j
manent alimony still holds, and if ever ;
Mrs. Wagner knows of his having any- |
; thing that she can recover I will at once i
issue a warrant."
Many Bequests.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 13.â The will of j
Hannah G. Noyes was filed for probate to
day. She left the following legacies : ' /

LE CONTE IS VIGOROUS
: The Great Professor Will Now
Concentrate Himself on
Higher Work.
Courses May Be Combinedâ Professor
Watson Coming â Sanitary
District Election.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 13.â 1t was
announced to-day that Dr. Joseph Le
I Conte, the veteran geologist at the State
I University, will discontinue his lectures
in elementary and structural geology and
in zoology during the next academic year,
with the view of confining his attention to
the higher under-graduate and the post
graduate courses.
The announcement was not altogether a
surpri se to the students, as the change had
been anticipated for some time past, and
in consequence an unusually large num- |
ber are taking Dr. Le Conte courses this j
year, fearing that it might be their last
opportunity. The other members of the
faculty have been prevailing upon the i
distinguished geologist for the past two I
years to give up his elementary courses,
lest in his advancing years the work
would bear down upon him too heavily.
Last year they made a special appeal to j
him to lighten his labors, but he said that
he wished to continue in the same chan
nel for at least another year.
Though Dr. Le Conte celebrated his
seventy-third birthday in February he !
does not show the least sign of a decline !
in strength and activity, save a slight j
drooping of the shoulders. He says that j
he feels as vigorous to-day as he did ten !
years ago. To show how he has kept up
his daily work it only needs to be said I
that he" has missed but one daily reci
tation in seven years. It is now just
forty years since Dr. Le Conte began teach
| ing geological science.
Much regret has been expressed by the
students because of Dr. Le Conte's inten
tion to cease giving his elementary lec
tures, as they have grown to be among the
most popular courses in the university. In
I his geology course alone there are nearly
i 200 students enrolled. . .'â :â _
May Combine the Courses.
BERKELEY Cal., April 13.â The facul
' ties of the colleges of natural science and
j of medicine of the State University have
i under consideration a plan to more closely
j connect the two courses and thus to shorten
j the time requisite for graduation from
both. If adopted, there will be a six-year
courseâ three in the College of Natural
Science at Berkeley and three in the
Medical College in San Francisco. The
student, upon the completion of, the six
year course, will receive the degree of
B.S. and M.D.. whereas under the present
system he must do seven years of satis
factory work ' before getting his two de
grees. It is generally considered among
the students at Berkeley that such an in
novation will prove to be of great benefit.
Sanitary District Election. .yy
BERKELEY, Cal., April 13.â The citi
zens of the Adeline sanitary district will
hold an election next Wednesday, calling
lor the issuance of $7000 bonds, to be ex
pended in the construction of a main
sewer to connect with the bay.
The polling-place will be at Caldwell
Hall, and the polls will be open for the
usual length of time. Y~-~-~ :.y â .;'.
The officers will be as follows: Judges,
Caldwell and M. M. Skewey; inspect
ors, L. Chalower and N. Pushey ; ballot
clerks, L. Quanich and F. Ollerich; clerks,
Â£. K. Mains and H. Germain. -â¢â 
The election will be conducted under
the general law of the State.
i Professor Watson Coming.
' BERKELEY, Cal., April 13â Professor
Watson, head of the department of philos
phy at Queen's College. Canada, who is to"
visit the University of California for the
purpose of delivering a public lecture
before the Philosophical Union, will leave
his home in a few days, so as to arrive here
by the Ist of May.
Co-Ed Contest.
BERKELEY, Cal.. April There is a
strong probability of another intercol
legiate co-ed contest being held in the
near future. Stanford has a co-ed tennis
club and it is understood that the young
ladies are anxious to send a challenge to
Berkeley.
ROSE HAS ONLY A TITLE.
Lives in a Hut and Declares
y That He Has Not a
Cent Left.
His Wife's Fiiends Expect Soon to
See Him With Another Castle
and Wife.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
;â¢ -. . 90S Broadway, April 12. f
Don Manuel Rose, the Portuguese noble
man of Warm Springs, received some
very discouraging news to-day. The sec
retary of the Supreme Court informed
his attorney that all the judgments in
favor of his wife had been affirmed and
that he is now wifeless, fortuneless and
houseless. All that remains for him, ac
cording to his own story, is the title of
Don, which he inherited and over which
American courts have no jurisdiction.
Mrs. Maria Rose is now a free woman,
the owner of Castle Rose and of other
property. -b'b
The troubles of the Roses have been in
the courts since February, 1894, and when
a judgment was reached in the Superior
Court several months ago an appeal was
taken to the Supreme Court and an affir
mation of judgment was entered to-day.
Every step of the case was stubbornly con
tested and the trial occupied thirty days.
Rose was regarded as a petty monarch at
Warm Springs, and every day a large con
tingent of his and his wife's friends came
down to see and hear and testify.
Attorney F. W. Fry, who conducted the
prosecution, gained a judgment mainly by
impeachment of the Davis witness. Even
the court was forced to acknowledge that
there was danger of more witnesses being
held for perjury.
Attorneys G. C. Langan.C. C. Hamilton,
Welles Whit more and E. M. Gibson ap
peared for Rose, and during the trial it
was learned that he was quite wealthy.
After the judgment of the lower court
was rendered the Sheriff was ordered to
install Mrs. Rose at Castle Rose, and when
he visited the homestead he found it
protected by armed men. Not anxious to
precipitate bloodshed the deputy with
drew, and after Rose was convinced that
he had nothing to gain by force he quietly
left and when the deputy went again the
ranch was vacated.
Don Rose then went to live in a little
hut owned by his brother. He declared
that he had nothing left in the world and
bis wife had all. lie says he has not a
dollar and is still living in poverty. Mrs.
Rose says he has merely been representing
that he was poor for the purpose of back
ing up points made in his appeal. He
still exercises his influence in the Portu
guese colony, and it is expected that he
will now build himself another castle and
take another wife who has no mother
living, as his experience in the past with
a mother-in-law is not pleasant to him.

SLAVES SOLD
FOR SPOT CASH
Chinese Women Openly Im
ported Into California
by Brokers.
THE WORK OF RESCUE.
Romance of Keng Ying and a
Duck That Flew Away With
Her Husband.
MISS CAMERON'S EXPERIENCE.
How a Well-Educated Woman Was
Dragged Into the Toils and
Rescued by Kinship.
Human slavery in the United States was
abolished by force of arms more than
thirty years ago, yet it exists in California
to-day.
Human beings are bought and sold for
cash, and these slaves are imported into
this State, and successfully pass through
the hands of the revenue officials (there
being no duty on slaves), and the Immi
gration Commissioners have let down the
bars to the pseudo wives of pseudo Chinese
merchants. And slave and master pass in
Indian file with their tongues stuck de
risively in their cheeks through the flimsy
barriers erected by a powerful Government
against the importation of criminals, pau
pers, prostitutes and slaves.
Not only this, but these so-called mer
chants' wives after being herded into vile
dens, in vile alleys for vile purposes, are
not only allowed to exercise their calling
in the broad glare of day, but they are
protected by white men paid by their
masters and wearing silver stars express
ing the police powers vested in them by
the authorities of this City.
It was an easy thing to drive out the
denizens of Morton street. George, the
strangler set the ball rolling with Mamie
McDermott, while the fool, who a week or
two afterward sent a bullet through the
Bkull of another Famine and wiped himself
from off the earth with another bullet fin
ished the job. But it is not so ea sy a task
to wipe out the evil in Chinatown. In
fact, the opinion of that portion of the
public most interested in political affairs
seems to favor the confining of the evil to
the Chinatown quarters, where there is no
body to be shocked except Christian men
and women, who believe that a China
man's soul is just as much worth saving
as that of a white man.
Ever since The Chinese set foot upon the
shores of California human chattel slavery
has existed. The army of Custom-house
officials, the Immigration Commissioners,
the law? of the land, the whole power of a
united Christian sentiment backed by the
moral sentiment of the entire community
have thus far been but a portiere of cob
web* across the Golden Gate, so far as ex
cluding these yellow slaves is concerned.
The churches unable to stay the influx
of this tide of moral leprosy have at
tempted to do the next best thing, which
is to rescue such of those slaves as may be
willing to accept the hospitality and the
kind and loving care of the gentle Chris
tian women oi the missions. Much good
has been done in this way and much good
is being done, hut, severe as may be the
reflection against the lack of intelligence
and the lethargy of the governing
power of the City, whatever good has been
accomplished has been done with private
funds. The kind hands which are lifting
the weeping slaves out of the gutter are
those ol private individuals, actuated by
the desire to follow in the footsteps of the
good and gentle one who challenged a
howling mob that wolf-like snapped and
barked at a sinful woman cowering at his
feet.
Miss D. M. Cameron told last night
about some episodes of Chinese slave life
in this City. She is Miss Culbertson's as
sistant in the Presbyterian Chinese Mission
on Sacramento street. She told the story
of Keng Ying, a Chinese woman, who,
contrary to the usual custom-, had been
well enough educated at home to write in
the classics of her native tongue. This
was about the only respect in which the
story of Keng Y'ing differed from a thou
sand and one stones told by Chinese
women who have been brought to this
country in slavery.
Keng Ying was married in China with
the usual Mongolian ceremonies. After
she and her husband had lived together
for a while, he made up his mind to go to
Portland, Or., where he would open a gen
eral merchandise store and become rich in
a few years.
That's what he told his wife. Prepara
tions for departure were leisurely made,
husband and wife went on. board the
steamer, and a few minutes before the ves
sel was about to steam away from the
dock, this loving husband remembered
something that he had forgotten on shore.
He would be back in three flaps of a duck's
wine, he said, in the beautiful imagery of
the pigtailed civilization. But the duck
flew far away over the horizon and the
steamer followed the duck, so that Keng
ing, being deserted and alone, bowed
her head and allowed the big briny tears
to stain her silken bloomers. She was
very angry at the Taoist priest to whom
she had gone for advice, because the
iadestone anklets and bracelets she had
bought from him bad not brought her
good fortune. While she still wept in the
close steerage a yellow hand with long,
dirty nails was laid upon her shoulder
and a falsetto voice piped like a desic
cating north wind into her ear: "Let the
fairest rose of the Mandarin's garden weep
no more. The gods have blessed her. In
stead of an ungrateful husband they have
given her a kind and indulgent master."
Then he leered at her with bleared and
yellow eyes, and she knew that the com

mon lot had befallen her and that she had
been sold into slavery. ---:
Within twenty-four hours after arriving
in Portland she had passed into the hands
of a new master, her cash value increasing
with each transfer. Then she was brought
to San Francisco and the horror of the life
so smote upon whatever there was of good
in her nature that she wrote a letter beg
ging for deliverance. She addressed it in
lier|family name and persuaded anohter
slave, who had taken pity upon her, to de
liver it to some merchant of that name.
The graceful and educated phrasing of j
the note impressed the merchant with the
fact that she must have come of a good
family. In fact, the family name she bore
was that of his own. By Oriental custom
she was a cousin of his, and he at once
called upon Miss Culbertson of the Presby
terian Mission. : r y- : y'yYyvY.
Her rescue was easily effected. She was
in a room in the big and overcrowded
lodging-house on the corner of Washing
ton street and VVashington alley, and whrti
Miss Culbertson called her she was fright
ened and refused to unlock the door, but
upon being reassured by the Chinese guide
as to the ooject of the" visitors she drew
the bolt and gladly accompanied Miss
Culbertson to the Mission Home, where
she now remains. . ' .Vf'
That was about a week ago.
A little while before that Miss Culbert
son rescued two Chinese women from a
life of shame. Hardly a month passes
without a slave being taken under the
shelter of the home.
"Cannot this traffic in slaves be
stopped?" was asked.
"It should be," replied Miss Culbertson.
"The Occidental Board have often talked
on the subject, but they have never been
able to devise a plan to put an end to the
importation of women slaves. These
women and the slave-brokers swear that
they are the wives of merchants, and the
pretended merchants come forward and
also swear to it.
"But more caution should be exercised.
The examination should be more strict. I
have been told that it costs $500 or $600 to.
land one of these slaves. One old crone
used to boast that she didn't even have to
go down to the wharf to look after her
charges. They were landed without any
difficulty and" delivered to her in China
town.
"Yes," added Miss Culbertson, "women
are bought and sold in Chinatown every
day, and we have not been able to prevent
it. Can any one suggest a plan to remedy
the evil?" ___Â£%
O'DONNELL'S BAND BILL
Musicians' Union After the
Chronic Candidate's Poli
tical Scalp.
He Failed to Pay for the Music That
Attended Him in the Last
Campaign.
The Musicians' Union at a recent meet
ing decided not to enter politics. The
musicians will, however, make one excep
tion, and that will be in the case of Dr.
C. C. O'Donneil, the persistent candidate for
some oflice or other. There is no inten
tion on the part of the union of working
in the interests of the white-haired doctor.
On the contrary, the musicians propose to
knife him, and already they are putting a
razor edge on that weapon.
The trouble is all about a oil! for music
a bill of about $60 that remains unp aid
since the last election. It will be remem
bered that during the campaign year of
1594 Dr. O'Donneil wanted to be elected
Mayor of this City, and in order to attract
the attention of the voting element of the
community he sent expressmen around
the City sounding a cowbell in wagons
built up with election transparencies.
Someone called his attention to the fact
that he could never "pull" the laboring
vote by thus 'â¢scabbing" on the business
of organized labor.
The hint was not thrown away, and the
biennial candidate at once secured the
services of a union band of musicians to
play patriotic airs whenever he held forth.
By the time Dr. O'Donneil officially
learned that the people did not want him
to preside as Mayor the bill for his band
music amounted to $120.
In the course of time those who pumped
music for the doctor obtained about $60,
but. from all accounts, they have never
seen the color of the balance. Complaints
were frequently lodged at union head
quarters that the debtor had failed, after
various excuses," to liquidate. Hence the
boycott that has been placed upon the as
piring doctor. One of the members of the
union yesterday said:
Dr. O'Donneil cannot get any more music
from the union musicians until he pays that
bill, and it is doubtful if he can even then. 1
hear that he intends to run for Congress.
Well, we will know it if he gets there. The
members of the union will remember the last
election and they will tell the other labor
unions how promptly the doctor pays the
workingmen their dues. As he has drawn his
heaviest support from the ranks of organized
labor, he may find himself a little short of
votes this year.
At the last meeting of the union it was
decided that "the prices contained in the
pricelist shall refer to one establishment or
locality only." The explanation of this
was that during the recent grand opera
season at the Baldwin Theater members of
the California Theater orchestra were
transferred to the Baldwin Theater to play
the grand opera engagement, for which
they received no extra compensation. The
question as to whether the union's laws
had been violated was brought before the
board of directors through a member who
believed he had been injured by this ar
rangement. It was claimed on the other
side that both houses being under one
management were considered as one or
chestra, and consequently no laws had
been violated. The directors desired that
the union should settle the matter and
recommended the enactment of the above
resolution.
JAMES N. BROWN DIES.
His Death Came Suddenly, Just Ten
J Months After Ills Brilliant
Wedding.
James N. Brown died rather suddenly
Sunday morning at his father's home, 1019
Bush street. He was 31 years of age.
After luncheon at the University Club
last Friday he became ill. That evening
the attack returned in a > more virulent
form and he took to bed. Next day jhe
grew worse, and a consultation by Drs.
Luke Robinson, Rosenstirn and George
Chismore was held. The physicians
agreed that the intestines had lapped, but
nothing could be done to save his life.
Mr. Brown was a member of the in
surance and commission firm of Brown &
Eyre, and the son of Thomas Brown,
cashier of the Bank of California. His
death occurred exactly ten months to a
day after his marriage to Miss Alice Scott,
daughter of Irving M. Scott.- The wed
ding was a brilliant society event at Grace
Church, on California street.' It was fol
lowed by a reception and lireakfa3t at the
bride's home, on Rincon Hill. After the
honeymoon at Castle Crags Mr. Brown
built a home for himself and his bride at
Pierce and .'Jackson . streets. The house
was recently finished and elegantly fur
nished, and it is only a few weeks since it
was occupied by the youne couple.
The funeral will be held this morning at
11 o'clock from Grace Church. -y.

FROM AFRICAN JUNGLES
William Astor Chanler, Author
and Explorer, Tells of His
Big March.
A Practical Tribute to the Rhinoceros
as an Agile and a Game
Quadruped.
A tall, well-knit, strongly built young
man with the nut brown complexion of a
sailor fresh from Tropic seas; with a
breezy but unassuming manner, unosten
tatiously dressed in a suit of pepper and
salt tweed, with the romantic cigarette be
tween his lips, stood in the Palace Hotel
grillroom last night chatting with some
newly made acquaintances about his im
pressions of California.
His name is William Astor Chanler,
African explorer and traveler.
Though not much more than 30 he has
Been much of life. He has fought with
elephants, rhinoceri, hippopotami, striped
tigers, boa constrictors, basso profundo
lions, chest-thumping gorillas and the
others which have made society in Africa
as hot as a Texas tamale. He has braved
the torrid sands of New Mex
ico and Arizona, and, above all else, he
has been the brother-in-law of Amelie
Rives-Chanier, the poetess, who has writ
ten "The Quick and the Dead" and other
hot stuff.
Mr. Chanler is an author, and a few
weeks ago finished his first book, "Through
Jungle and Desert," a lecord of his Afri
can explorations, extending from 1892 to
1894. The work will contain about 100 il
lustrations, from photographs taken by
himself and his associates. It will be is
sued from the press in about two weeks. ,
"We had bad luck with our photo
graphs," explained Mr. Chanler. "We
took 800 glass plates with us and filled
them with views. They were packed with
the greatest care, yet when the boxes were

Mr. Chanler started from the west coast
of Zanzibar early in 1892 with a retinue of
200 men. His intention was to traverse an
unexplored and mapless region in the
interest of science, and after much hard
ship and many encounters with wild
beasts and savage .tribes he succeeded in
penetrating a desert country for 800 miles
from the sea coast. He found the country
to resemble Southern Arizona very much
in appearance and in the matter of heat
and dryness.
Lieutenant yon Hohnel of the Dutch
navy accompanied the party, but was se-
riously wounded in the thigh by a rhi
noceros and was obliged to return to the
coast under armed escort. While with the
party he made complete maps of the coun
try traversed, -yy.
"We had very much trouble with the
rhinoceros. ''He is an aggressive savage
beast," said Mr. Chanler. "They killed
one of my men and wounded three. They
are of great bulk and weight and look very
unwieldy, nut it is astonishing now active
they are. ' -
"They seem to : have a particular ani
mosity toward campfires, and it was their
habit to rush in upon the fires and trample
them. It was in this way that they
wounded many of my men. Steep side

BIKERS, NOT BURGLARS.
Albright and I.cc, Arrested at Midnight,
Honorably Acquitted.
Joseph Albright and Edward Lee were
arrested last week by Policemen Thomp
son and Blackman on Mission street and
taken to the Seventeenth-street station.
Albright was booked for having burglar's
to<-ls in his possession and Lee as a
vagrant.
When the cases were called in Judge
Low's court on Friday last it was conclu
sively shown that the young men were
not burglars, but merely belated cyclists.
The tools in Albright's possession were
such as he used in his trade as cornice
maker. â -â yy v.'-.' y .:'

IN LOVE AT SIXTEEN
Hilda Lind Tries to Commit
Suicide by Rushing Into
the Sea.
Hilda Lind, a bright little girl, 16 years
of age, is determined to die if she cannot
get Fred Potter for a husband.
Hilda lives with her mother and brother
at 10 Salina street, a small street running
off California street, between Stockton and
Dupont, and Fred lives next door. â¢ _y
They met on Kearny street yesterday
afternoon and went together to the Cliff
House. While walking along the beach
Hilda made a sudden rush into the break
ers, throwing herself face downward.
Fred was staggered for a moment, and
then he rushed wildly after her. He
grabbed hold of her dress just as the re
ceding waves were taking her out to sea.
Assi stance was procured and Hilda was
carried to the life-saving station,. where a
kindly matron disrobed her and she was
accommodated with an overcoat belonging
to one of the crew and an underskirt.
The patrol wagon was summoned and
she was taken to the City Prison, where
Mrs. Gilmore, the matron, took charge of
her. Fred went to her home and procured
a supply of clothing for her and took it to
the prison.
Hilda says she is madly, in love with
Fred. They have been keeping company
for some time, but her mother and brother
objected and told her only yesterday that
she must give Fred up as she was too
young to think of marriage. She made up
her mind that if she could not marry Fred
life was not worth the I living, so she re
solved to die, and. when they went to. the
bench she could not resist the temptation
to seek a watery grave. She declares that
she will be more successful next time un
less her mother and brother withdraw
their objection to Fred.
Her mother called at the prison to see
her last night and scolded her roundly for
her foolish behavior. She decided to allow
her to remain in prison till' to-day in the
hope that she might be more sensibly in
clined. :--.-/.â¢- .'

YOSEMITE COMMISSION
Four Members Whose Terms
Expire This Week Will
Retire.
John Boggs, a Democrat, Is One Who
Will Probably Be Re
nominated.
There is to be a change in the personnel
of the Yosemite Commissioners. This
week the terms of four of those who now
compose that body will expire and Gov
ernor Budd will be called upon to name
their successors.
"Those who go out," said Secretary J, F.
Sheehan, yesterday, "are George B. Sperry
of Stockton, H. K. Field of San Francisco,
Clinch of San Francisco and John
Boggs of Princeton. Boggs is a Democrat
and the others are Republicans. The
holdovers are General E. P. Johnson of
Los Angeles, H. J. Ostrander of Merced,
Max Goldberg of San Francisco and J. H.
O'Brien of Oakland, all Republicans. Then
there is Governor Budd, who is ex-oflicio
member of the board.
"Who are likely to succeed those who
are going out? Well, that I cannot say,"
continued the I secretary. "The Governor
has the choice and I have not the slight
est idea whom he has in mind for these
offices. He is not required by law to ap
portion the appointments, as in some com
missions, equally between the political
parties, and he may name all Democrats if
he feels so inclined! He will probably
make his nominations before the end of
tne week." -.' ">-.â .;â¢
There is considerable speculation in the
political world as to who will be named to
assist in watching over the interests of the
Yosemite Valley for the next four years.
The only one named as a probable suc
cessor is John Boggs, who will in all proba
bility be named to succeed himself.
The commission will hold its next meet
j ing in the valley on the first Wednesday
in June, and all the Commissioners will
I leave in the latter part of May to be pres
i ent at the meeting.
Galen Clark, the guardian of the valley,
J in letters dated April 2 and 7, writes that
i there has not been as much snow in the
valley during the winter as usual, that the
roads in the valley have been put in good
condition as far down as the cascades; that
the trails have been opened to the top of
the Nevada and Yosemite falls, and that
work has been in progress on the lower
portion of the trail to Glacier Point, to put
jit in safe condition for use. Some of the
j roads and trails were in places considera
bly washed out by the heavy winter
storms, but these have been repaired. 1 ;.*y
The first party of tourists arrived on the
I 25th of March, but those who composed it
were very much disappointed because of
the heavy fall of rain. There is to be
placed in position a telephone to the
valley as soon as supplies are received.
Both hotels are now open.
In his latest letter the guardian an
nounced that work had been commenced
on the trail to Glacier Point, and that it
would take at least a week to put it in
proper condition.
Mr. Stetson , of the Yosemite Valley
Railroad said yesterday the company was
anxiously awaiting the action of Congress
on the bill introduced by Senator Perkins
asking for ' a franchise for the company.
This road, which is to start from Merced,
will run to the valley. "Of course it must
be understood," said Mr. Stetson, "that it
is not the intention of the company to run
into the \ valley the purpose is to s run to
the boundary line of the valley and no
further. While we are waiting we have
surveyors at work on the line of the pro

Stole Hams and Bacon.
Albert Vernon and John Burns, alias Brad
ley, an ex-convict, were booked at the City
Prison yesterday by Policeman T. L. Ryan on
the charges of burglary and petty larceny.
They are accused of breaking into Bosen's
liquor-store. 404 Fourth street, Saturday night
and stealing some cigarettes and bottles of
rum and of stealing three hams and three sides
of bacon from A'illars & Luff's store, 400 Fifth

WRECK OF THE BLAIRMORE
Bids for the Raising of the
Sunken Ship to Be Opened
To-Day.
The wreck of the Blairmore still lies be
neath the waters of the bay, and it may be
a week before it is definitely known now
the six unfortunates who are caged in her
hold came to their death.
It is a matter of speculation among ship
captains. Some say the men were killed
by the falling ballast, and others say they
were smothered in the rush of water. Ail,
however, insist that in the compressed air
in the hold the men could not have lived
twenty minutes, much less an hour. The
only course that showed a particle of hope
was the cutting of the hole in the side, and
had the vessel been on the solid bottom it
would probably have proved successful.
Bids for the raising of the sunken ship
will be opened to-day, and offers are ex
pected from the Pacific Coast Dredging
and Reclamation Company; Healv, Tib
bitts Si Co., T. P. H. W_.iteiaw," Union
Iron Works, Risdon Iron Works, the John
D. Spreckels Tow boat Company and the
Ship-owners' and Merchants' Towboat
Company. They will probably range all
the way from $30,000 to $50,000. but as the
question is one of raising or losing, bid
ders will be chary. Should the contractor
succeed he will get the amount of his bid.
If he fails he looses everything.
All the different, bidders have been out
to the scene of the wreck and all have
made soundings. Some of them have sent
down divers, and they report that the ves
sel lies in an easy position. The topmasts
and upper rigging will have to be removed
and then it is thought that there will be
no difficulty in getting the ship on an even
keel. There will be no trouble in closing
the hole cut by the men from the Union
Iron Works, and then after the Blairmore
has been towed on the mud flats she can
be pumped out and the work of repairing
begun. b \ J
