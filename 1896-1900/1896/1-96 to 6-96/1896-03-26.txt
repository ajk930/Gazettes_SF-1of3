ARMS FOR THE ISLAJfDERS.
Cuban* Chang* Their Plans and Unload
the Three Friends' Cargo.
JACKSONVILLE. Fla., March 25.-It
was expected that the steamer Three
} riends would leave here last night with
another cargo of arms and ammunition for
the Cuban insurgents. The munitions were
on board and everything in readiness, but
at the last moment the Cubans changed
their plans, and this morning the arms
were unloaded from the steamer.
The dock of the Alabama Coal Company,
at the foot of Hogan street, presented the
appearance of a Government arsenal, for
there were thousands of cartridges and
carbines and rifles, and machetes by the
hundreds. Knapsacks, canteens and
other military equipment, sufficient to tit
out a small army, were scattered about,
but all of the articles were being checked
off and watched by Cubans. The arms
and ammunition were stored in the ware
house of the Alabama Coal Compauy.
H. B. Fritot kept account of every box
and package that was taken off the
vesseL Charles F. Fjitot superintended
the storing of the stores, and J. Huau
appeared to be superintending the work.
The boxes of cartridges were marked
"C. 8.," and the cases of rifles "Knight &
Wall, Tampa, care of Savaunah Steam
ship and Plant System."
The CubaDS who were looking after the
unloading and storing of the cargo for the
steamer will not say who the arms are for,
nor why they are being taken off the
steamer on the eve of her leaving for a trip
to the south. Henry Fritot said that the
t artri'iges were not good and would lie sent
hack to tne factory to be reloaded. Mr.
Huau said that they did not need the arms
in Cuba just yet and they would be kept
here until the United States recognized the
Cubans as belligerents. "When that is
done," said he, "the arms and other mili
tary pquipmtnt will be sent to the Cuban
service."
Machetes wÂ«re largely in evidence. They
were shipped in canvas sacks, each sack
containing twenty-five. One of them was
an old blade with a horn handle, through
which a cord was fastened to go over the
wrist. The blade was stained and looked
as if it had been used considerably. The
r.ew machetes were made by Collins & Co.,
Hartford, Conn.
The unloading of the steamer was
watched by a representative of the Span
ish authorities and a few minutes after the
work began the Spanish Vice-Consul en
tered the building and called on several of
the officials. The Spaniards appear to
think that the Government should seize
the arms and the vessel that had them on
board.
2HE CUB AS JtJSSOLUTIOXS.
It Is Thought the House Will Give Wmy
to the Stnnte-
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.â After
a session of three-quarters of an hour this
afternoon the conferred on the Cuban reso
lutions adjourned until to-morrow without
reaching a conclusion. The drift of the
discussion showed, however, that there
was a firm intention on the }>art of the
committee to report resolutions that would
meet the approval of t..th houses.
The matter of accepting the Senate reso
lution was discussed, one memoer of the
committee taking the ground that this
Government had no right to asK another
Government to recognize the independ
ence of one of its colonies which was in in
surrection, and it was insisted that this
would be a casus belli.
In answer to this it was shown that
when the Cubans were in insurrection be
fore our Minister to Spain, General Dan
iel Sickles, was instructed to exercise his
goodly offices to secure such a recognition
at the laamis of Spain, and that at that
time Spain took no offense at the action.
All things considered there appeared to
be a desire to accept the Seriate resolution,
and if this is done there is no doubt but
what the House would agree to such a
r port.
The condition of affairs in the Senate
was discussed this afternoon very frankly.
It was made plain thai there was a small
bui determined minority, headed by Sen
The San Francisco Call.
ator Hale, that did not propose to permit
the Cuban resolutions to ever come
to a vote if they could prevent
it. In fact, the Committee on For
eign Relations had been warned that
a quiet but effective system of fili
bustering had been inauguratpd with a
view to preventing a vote on the question
in the Senate. For this reason the House
conferrees were urged to accept the Senate
resolutions, -which would remove the de
bate from the Senate to the House, where
filibustering could not, under the rules, be
engaged in. It is believed to be the most
probable outcome of the conference, and it
would not surprise the members of the
House to-morrow if the House managers
recede from the House resolutions and
accept those originally passed by the
Senate.

British Government is causing uneasiness.
It is rumored in Pretoria that an im
portant telegram has been received from
the British authorities requesting an im
mediate reply to a former communication,
and Kruger has asked for an extension of
time in which to make answer. The posi
tion of the leaders in the reform move
ment will become critical in the event of
further friction. Boer feeling is now high

ROME, Italy, March 25.â 1n the Senate
to-day Baron Blanc, ex- Minister of For
eign Affairs, affirmed that the alliance
between Great Britain and Italy was an
accomplished fact. The overtures for
peace, which had been made with a view
to the eventual evacuation of Kassala,
Baron Blanc said, had determined the au
thorities upon a public, definite manifes
tation of alliance, which was founded upon
a more solid basis than protocols, namely,
a community for defensive interests. This
community would henceforth be extended
to the security of Italy as a maritime
power, ard the Mediterranean power of
Italy would now become an effective bond
between Gfeat Britain and the Dreibund.
Signor Simonetti, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, concurred in Baron Blanc's state
ment. He created somewhat of a sensa
tion by dtclaring that if the Dongola ex
pedition was aimed at the reconquering of
the Soudan Italy must, if the conquest be
effected, and if Great Britain so desires,
restore Kassala.
Advices received from Massowah state

chief of the Italian forces in Abyssinia,

Washington special says: A dispatch from
Lor>don announces that ex-Consul Wal
ler's solicitor writes to the Times that he
has declined to accept the conditions upon
which the French Government offered
to release Waller, and that he preferred
to remain in prison rather than waive all
claim for damages. Waller declined to
accept the conditions on which he was
released in waiving all claims for indem
nity, but as Embassador Eustis, by in
structions from the State Department,
made the waiver on the part of the Govern
ment of the United States, Waller's de
cision was evidently regarded as of no con
sequence.
He got his freedom with the informa
tion that the American Embassy would
give security in any action which he
might bring against the French Gov
ernment. In pursuance of this arrange
ment Waller's solicitor is seeking a set
tlement with France in behalf of his
client.
Waller is in London and will xeave for

GENERAL CASEY'S
SUDDEN DEATH
Paralysis of the Heart
Takes Off a Born
Soldier.
HIS PUBLIC SERVICES.
An Able Executive Officer, a
Good Hater and a Firm
Friend.
HIS SKILL AS AIT ENGINEER.
Superintended the Erection of Many
National Buildings and
Monuments.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.-Brig
adier-General Thomas Lincoln Casey (re
tired), late chief of engineers, U. S. A.,
died at his residence in this city at 2
o'clock this afternoon.
General Casey, accompanied by his son,
was on his way to his office in the Mew
Congressional Li brary building, the con
struction of which he had charge, and was
taken ill in a streetcar. He was carried
into the library and a physician sum
moned, who administered remedies tnat
relieved him sufficiently in the course of
an hour to enable him to be removed to
his home. There, after suffering another
relapse, he suddenly died, as is supposed,
fioni paralysis of the heart, superinduced
by acute indigestion.
"A vigorous administration, a skill in
profession and an unsullied integrity have
characterized the execution Dy him of the
varied and important duties confided to
his charge," was the eulogy of General
Casey contained in the concluding para
graph of the general orders issued May 10,
1885, announcing the retirement of Gen
eral Casey from active service.
He was an able executive officer, a good
hater and a firm friend. Brusque in man
ner, he was nevertheless a man of great
tenderness of feeling, greatly endeared to
his friends.
General Casey was the son and grandson
of soldiers. Hia father was General Silas
Casey and a brother of that name, Captain
Silas Casey, United States navy, still sur
vives. He was born at Madison Barracks,
Sacketts Harbor, N. V., May 10, 1893, and
in 1848 received an appointment to the
United States military academy as a cadet
at large and four years later graduated at
the head of his class. Entering the engineer
corps as second lieutenant in 1852 he was
assigned to duty in connection with works
of improvement in Delaware River and
bay. Sent to the Northwest, General
Casey in 1860 commanded a detachment
encaged in the construction of a wagon
road from Vancouver, AVash., to Cowlitz
River, Or.
At the outbreak of the Civil War he
was sent to New England as superintend
ing engineer of the permanent defenses
and held fortifications on the coast of
Maine. In March, 1865, he was brevetted
lieutenant-colonel "for faithful and meri
torious services during the war." He was |
sent to Europe in 1873 on official business.
Later he served as superintending engi
neer of public buildings and grounds in
the District of Columbia and was placed
in charge of the Potomac aqueduct. To
him also was committed the completion
of the State, War and Navy Department
building; the Washington National monu
ment; the construction of the National
Medical Museum and Library; the erec
tion of the monument over the grave of
Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, Va. ; that
of Washington's headquarters at New
burgh, N. V. ; that to mark the birthplace
of Washington, and the Garfield statue
and pedestal in Washington.
From 1886 to 1888 he was president of
the board of engineers for fortifications
and other public works at New York, and
on July 6, 1888, he was appointed briga
dier-general and chief of engineers, U. S. A.,
by President Cleveland. In October, 1888,
he was charged by an act of Congress with
the construction of the Congressional
NLibrary building, and in appreciation of
his ability Congress continued him after
retirement in charge of the work
completion." He was in pursuance of his
duty when stricken.
The War Department was informed of
General Casey's death this afternoon be
fore the close of office hours. Appropriate
action will be taKen, but orders embody
ing it will not be issued until the family
can be consulted.

DAMROSCH IN TROUBLE.
Leading Members of His German Opera
Company Are Suing Him for
Various Amounts.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 25.â The
Herald says this morning: The relations
between Walter Darnrosch and his Ger
man opera company seem to be a little
strained. Two of the principals have
begun suit against him for various
amounts, and the chorus has shown signs
of incipient rebellion
William Gruening says he made a con
tract with Dainrosch for forty perform
ances at $600 a- performance, and although
his regular season was not to begin until
November 20 he consented to sign in the
place of Herr Alvary, who was ill. He
sang "Tristan" in Cincinnati and declined
to do so in Chicago until Damrosch agreed
to give him $1200. When they made the
final settlement Damrosch deducted $600,
which, he said, he had overpaid the tenor
for his "Tristan" performance months
ago. Hence the suit.
Damrosch, Gruening's attorneys say,
takes the ground that the tenor imposed
on him when he was helpless. Gruening
also claims $76 for transportation of bag
gage.
Fraulein Mulder says that Damrosch
discharged her without cause on March 6,
and declined to pay her hotel bills in New
York. She therefore brings suit for $558
salary and $222 for hotel bills, which she
was obliged to pay herself.
THE OTHER BROWN CASE.
Madison's Minister Is Acquitted of Every
Charge Af/aintt Him.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., March 25.â The
council in the heresy case of Rev. William
T. Brown met at noon to-day in the Con
gregational Church at Madison. Rev.
Newman Smyth of New Haven read the
decision of the council by whitfh Rev. Dr.
Brown was acquitted of every charge. The
document was a very important one, as it
was the first formal expression of a Con
gregational council on the "new theology."
Tne decision of this body is Hnal, so far
as any authority is superior to the indi
vidual church. It declared that the result
of the labors of the scholars during the
last quarter of a century had been to ex
plain much that had hitherto been ob
scure, and that the education of the min
ister at Madison had made him acquainted
with these views.

CARSON, VwTi, March 25.â The trial of
Henry Piper, charged with the sealing of
crude amalgam from the Carson mint,

on that day there was received a certain
deposit of amalgam and an unusual loss
occurred while in tbat room; that during
the day the defendant deposited his lunch
basket in a small cupboard; that one of
the employes in searching the cupboard
moved the basket and found it very heavy.
He called another employe, and removing
the cover they found some amalgam. One
remained on guard to see that Piper did
not take the basket away; the other went
to report the matter to the superintendent.
While the latter was gone Piper came into
the room, took the basket, and with it
went to the eievator-shaft and dumped the
contents to the bottom of the shaft. He
then started to run toward the basement
at the bottom of the elevator-shaft. The
chief clerk called to him to stop, but ha
refused to do so, and vrhen the party
reached the bottom of the shaft the amal
gam, with the exception of a few fine
pieces, was gone."
The evidence introduced by the prosecu
tion completely bore out this charge.
Judge Murphy, attorney for the defendant,
introduced technical evidence, and asked
tne Judge to instruct the jury to return a
verdict of not guilty. He declared that
there was no proof to show that the
bullion was the property of the United
States; that there was no value proved;
that the defendant, having the custody of
the bullion taken from the depot to the
mint, if guilty of anything, should be
charged with embezzlement, and that as
larceny was defined to be the felonious
taking of another's property, but as no
evidence was introduced to show that the
defendant took the property out of the
mint he should be found "not guilty."
After some discussion the value of the
bullion was fixed at fl. The case waa sub
mitted without argument on either side,
and the jury within an hour returned the
verdict. Sentence will be passed on Satur
day, and Piper is now in the custody of
the United States Marshal.-
TRAGEDY IN NEVADA CITY
Lineman Farris Killed at the
Top of an Electric
Light Shaft.
His Hand Touched a Bare Wire and
It Held Him as Though
in a Vise.
NEVADA CITY. March 25.â Charles L.
Farris, an electrician and lineman, em
ployed by the Nevada County Electric
Power Company, was killed this afternoon,
while about to make repairs to the electric
wire at the Providence mine. He had
climbed a pole for the purpose of soldering
a joint in the wire. Finding the current
was very strong, he remarked to his part
ner, K. G. Dunn : "It is too hot here."
Dunn told him not to attempt to solder,
but to come down.
Farris started to descend the pole, when
one of his climbing spurs slipped, and he
threw up one hand to save himself. A3
he did so, his hand caught the bare wire
that was carrying about 3000 volts, and he
â was held there as if in a vise. A rope was
soon; afterward placed around his body,
and several men pulled him loose from the
wire. His death had no doubt been in
stantaneous.
FarriÂ§ had resided here for several
months, and was well liked. He was a
large man, weigning over 200 pounds. He
leaves a widow and two daughters, one of
whom is married. Farris was an experi
enced electrician.

Hot Fight Over the Silver
Question in the State
Convention.
SILVER MEN DEFEATED.
The Reed Boom Is Given a Boost
by the Republicans of
Texas.
MINNESOTA FAVORS MORTON.
Six Delegates Bolt in a Georgia Con
vention and Declare for
Reed.
HURON, S. Dak., March 25.â McKinley
swept the Republican State Convention
amid great enthusiasm. There was not a
dissenting vote. South Dakota's eight
delegates are instructed for the Ohio man
and for "sound money." The big fight of ;
the convention was between the silver and j
"sound money" men.
Senator Pettigrew made a powerful fight
to prevent any expression on the silver
question, and presented a long argument
before the resolutions committee. The
latter unanimously reported, and the con
vention unanimously adopted as the
money plank the National platform
of 1892. The resolutions also required
all aspirants for positions of delegates
to rise and declare their attitude toward
silver and pledge themselves to not only
vote but to work for "sound money" at
St. Louis. Every one did this, including
Pettigrew, the latter stating that he bowed
to the will of the majority.
Several speakers severely arraigned the
silver men as un-Republican. The anti-
Pettigrew men had threatened that in case
the silver men raised the question they
would leave Pettigrew at home. The
other seven delegates held a meeting and I
pledged themselves to not allow Pettigrew '
to be chairman or to be on the creden- i
tials or platform committee at St. Louis,
or to vote for National committeeman.
The convention stood three to one i
against silver and it was proposed for a j
time to leave Pettigrew off the delegation,
but the Senator had threatened in a speech
in Sioux Falls that his defeat meant a
Populistic victory. The leaders decided
that the interests of the party were op
posed to further humiliating him.
TEXAS REPUBLICANS.
More Than Half of the National JDele~
gates Are for Head.
AUSTIN, Tex., March 25.â Owing to the
delay of Chairman Coney in selecting
committees the Republican convention
did not meet to-day until I o'clock, at
which time committees were announced,
and adjournment was had until 7 p. m. At
that hour the convention was called to j
order, and the committee on credentials
not being ready to report, tne convention
adjourned until to-marrow at 10 o'clock.
The committee on resolutions to-night
agreed to report to the convention to
morrow resolutions in favor of "sound
money," and a tariff, notwithstanding the
idea all along, has been not to touch such
matters. The resolutions will undoubt
edly be adopted. .
Knowing ones place the thirty delegates
Texas will send to the National Convention
as follows : Reed 16, McKinley 8, Allison 6.
The credentials committee to-morrow
will recommend ratifying the McKinley
delegation, and whatever they report will
be adopted.
Cuney, in selecting the committees, has
wholly ignored the McKinley men, and
has placed W. M. McDonald, State man
ager for Reed, at the head of the commit
tee on credentials. His action has given
the Reed element, which had been lost in
the shuffle, new life, and this after
noon the Cuney combination made up the
following slate to elect as delegates to the
National Convention to-morrow: D. B.
Ferguson, Wright Cuney, W. M. Makeme
son and A. T. Terrell. The two latter are
white and both originally Reed men; the
two first are colored and are for Allison.
Up to this afternoon the Cuney combine
had been willing to accede to the election
of Chairman Grant of the State Executive
Committee, a McKinley man, but a caucus
to-day of McKinley men, called, it
is said, to discuss the advisability of
cutting loose from the Black and Tan
wing and holding an exclusive "white con
vention," they determined the fate of Grant
fend he was dropped from the list of dele
gates, and the McKinleyites, who Tuesday
morning believed they would carry the
convention with a whoop, are entirely left
out.
FROM MINNESOTA.
Large Meeting of the League of Repub
lican Clubt.
ST. PAUL, Minn., March 25.â The Min
nesota League of Republican Clubs met
here to-day with an attendance of over
800 representatives of the clubs
of the State. The body adopted
resolutions pledging its fealty and
loyal support to the principles of the Re
publican party and pledged its rnited
efforts to secure the election of the candi
dates nominated by the Repnblican Na
tional Convention. Eli S. Warner of St.
Paul was elected president of the league
over Daniel S. Bruckart of St. Cloud by a
vote of 545 to 290. C. L. Smith of Minne
spolis was unanimously elected secretary.
An evening meeting was held, which
was addressed by Frank F. Davis of Minne
apolis, and the president of the National
League, General Edwin A. McAlpin of
New York.
In an interview General McAlpin spoke
in favor of Levi P. Morton for President,
and said he saw nothing in the returns so
far to indicate that McKinley would cer-
Uinly be nominated at St. Louis.
Holt in a Georgia Convention.
SAVANNAH, Ga m March 25.â The Re

DEATH OF A SAN JOSEAN .
Jasper Babcock's Eventful Ca
reer Draws to a Peace
ful Close.
Made and Lost Two Fortunes in "the
Early Daysâ Active in Cali
fornia Politics.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 25.â Jasper
Babcocfe, well known in sporting circles, a
| pioneer of the Pacific Coast, and one of
I the most energetic and enterprising of the
early residents of California and Nevada,
passed away in this city to-day at the
age of 74 years. He was a native of
Ashfork, Conn. While he was young
his parents removed to New York.
There, up to 1852, he was heavily en
gaged as a contractor in the construc
tion of railroads and canals. In this
capacity ne built fifteen miles of the New
York Central Railroad. After his removal
to San Francisco in 1852 he continued the
same work there, and successfully carried
out many of the extensive grading con
tracts in that city in early days.
Through the illegal issue of a large
amount of city script by Henry Meiggs,
who fled, Babcock lost over $100,000 and
became a bankrupt. He finally paid every
j cent of his debts, however. Afterward he
! was successful in mining in Nevada, but
lost all finally in a tumble in stoces.
Babcock was also active at one time in
politics in this Btate and Nevada. In 1859
! he was elected as a Douglass Democrat to
I the Legislature of Califorira. He was then
j a strong Union man and finally went into
the Republican party, in 1876 he was
elected to the Legislature from Storey
County, Nevada, and became Secretary of
| State of Nevada, in 1878, for a term of four
i years. In 1889 Mr. Babcock moved to San
j Jose, and has since resided here.
One daughter, Eleanor Barry, the ac
| complished actress, survives him.
THE GILROY FAILURE.
Jeweler Harry Frutig Files a Petition
in Insolvency.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 25. â Harry
Frutig, who has been engaged in the jew
elry business at Gilroy for the past fifteen
years, and who was alleged to have fled
from the town, to-day filed a petition in
insolvency. He attributes his failure to a
depression in business, a shrinkage in
values and a lack of trade. His liabili
ties amount to $4792.
The principal creditors are: Bank of
Gilroy. $320; J. P. Sargent of Gilroy $890;
J. P. Trafton, Los Angeles, $725; J. E.
Lewis. San Francisco, $725; George Green
zweig&Co., San Francisco, $309; H. T.
Jones, San Francisco, $415 ; Rothschild &
Haydenfelt, San Francisco, $526. The as
sets consist of a stock of jewelry valued at
$1150 and fixtures worth $250. Judge Rey
nolds set the hearing of the petition for
April 3.
The rumor that Frutig and his wife had
suddenly left the State was erroneous.
Fratig is now in San Francisco and will
return to Gilroy in a few days.
San Jose Divorce Suit.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 25.â Rose P.
Fanelli has commenced suit agfcinst Fran
cisco Fanelli for divorce on the ground of
extreme cruelty. They were married ten
years ago and reside at West Side. They
have four children. The plaintiff wants
the custody-of the four children and f25
per month alimony. An injunction re
straining Fanelli from disposing of some
property was issued.
CUT RATES FROM FRESNO
Mules and Wagons Compete

Miners' Supplies Hauled Across Coun

FRESNO, Cal., March 25. -Opposition
to the freight department of the "all-the
traffic-will-bear" railroad has been re
vived in the San Joaquin Valley. During
the Midwinter Fair a great freight team
of mules and two wagons were equipped
here to haul grain and merchandise be
tween this city and San Francisco. This
team entered the metropolis via San Jose
and the peninsula and successfully com
peted with its Kentucky corporation oppo
sition. The great wagon train remained
on exhibition at the fair for some days
after its arrival.
The same big wagons left here to-night,
headed for Stockton, with twelve tons of
provisions for about 100 men, who expect
to start by rail for San Francisco and
thence to the goldflelds of Alaska in a
few days. The load was made up in and
about Fowler, Selma and Kingsburg. The
enterprise is in the hands of Frank Dusy,
who has chartered a steamer from San
Francisco on which will be shipped this
cargo and its owners. The load will be
shipped from Stockton to San Francisco
by river steamers, and, notwithstanding
extra handling, Dusy guarantees to place
these supplies in San Francisco at $1 per
ton less than the Southern Pacific would
charge. The drive will require six days.

TEE MISCALLED OBSERVATORY
:
Hot Words Which Ended in an Ex
planation by the Illinois
Congressman.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.-The
Senate joint resolution to authorize Pro
fessors Newcomb and Hall, United States
navy, to accept decorations from the
French Government was to-day reported
by Sherman (R.) of Ohio from the Com
mittee on Foreign Relation and passed.
Sherman, also from the same committee,
reported a joint resolution authorizing
Benjamin Harrison to accept certain
medals (now in the custody of the State
Department) presented to him Dy the Gov
ernments of Brazil and Spain during the
term of his service as President of the
United States, and asked that it be put
upon its passage.
"Let that resolution go over," Allen
(Pop.) of Nebraska objected, and it went
over until to-morrow.
Gallinger (R.) of New Hampshire intro
duced a joint resolution for an amendment
to the Constitution of the United States
and asked that it lie on the table for the
present. It provides tuat neither Con
gress nor any State Legislature shall pass
any law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof; nor use the property or credit of
the United States or of any State or any
money raised by taxation for the purpose
of founding, maintaining or aiding any
church, religious denomination, or relig
ious society, or any institution that is
wnolly or in part under sectarian or eccle
siastical control.
The Senate then resumed the considera
tion of the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill. The section
fixing the salaries of United States Dis
trict Attorneys occupied attention for
several hours. The Senate Appropriation
Committee had in some particular cases
reported in favor of increasing the rates
fixed in the House bill and in other cases
amendments were offered by individual
Senators to increase them.
Strenuous opposition to all these in
creases was made by Allen (Pop.) of Ne
braska. They were also antagonized by
George (D.) of Mississippi, who regarded
the propositions by either House as ex
travagant and extraordinary.
Finally all the changes proposed by the
committee were adopted, as well as some
other increases proposed by individual
Senators.
A paragraph, giving to the Attorney-
General of the United States the authority
to allow marshals to employ clerical as
sistants and to fix their compensation,
was opposed by Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
on the ground that it was turning over
the duties of the legislative branch of the
Government to the Executive Department.
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts, chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, wnich had
considered this part of the bill, ridiculed
Allen's argument and said that to act
upon it would be to make Congress the
laughing-stock of mankind. If Congress
could not trust the Attorney-General with
the duty of saying how many clerical as
| sistants a marshal should have and what
their compensation should be, the repub
lican government, he thought, should
shut up shop and had better apply to the
Emperor of Russia or to the head of some
Populist club and take him for a despot.
Allen replied to Hoar in the same con
temptuous tone, saying that the only
sensible remark of the Massachusetts Sen
ator was that about applying to some
Populist club for information as to the
course to be adopted in running the Gov
ernment-
Allen's motion to strike out the para
graph was rejected.
, Without final action on tho bill the
Senate, at 5:25 o'clock, proceeded to the
consideration of executive business, and
soon afterward adjourned until to-mor
row.
IX THE HOUSE.
The Naval Appropriation Bill Causes a
Ijirely Discussion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.-At
12:30 o'clock the House, in committee of
the whole, proceeded to consider the naval
appropriation bill, and the opening speech
was made by Boutelle, chairman of the
Committee on Naval Affairs. Boutelle
explained the provisions of the bill as set
forth in his report accompanying it,
and gave the history of the construction
of the new navy and of the plants for
building the ships. He said the flag of
the country had been restored to the sea ;
that Columbia was indeed the gem of the
ocean, and that, ship for ship, the navy of
the United States was the best that floated.
[Applause.]
Cnmmings (D.)of New York said that
the bill was as economical as any that had
ever been brought before the House.
In response to a question by Dingley
( R.) of Maine Boutelle stated that the to
tal cost of the new work authorised in the
bill would probably be $22,863,000.
Low (R.) of New York made an argu
ment in favor of the extension of the navy
and then general debate on the bill was
closed.
A little breeze was evoked by Cannon
(It.) of Illinois, who assed Boutelle if be
could tell the House when the work of
building palatial quarters would be com
pleted for the officers detailed from the
navy to take charge of the miscalled naval
observatory, when they don't know any
more about astronomy than the average
member of Congress.
(Jammings (D.) of New York said that
in two different Congresses since he had
been a member of the House the question
of transferring the observatory from the
control of the Secretary of the Navy had
been raised by outside scientific influence.
The Naval Affairs Committee, after earnest
consideration, bad in both cases unani
mously voted against the change.
Robinson (R.) of Pennsylvania defended
the naval officers detailed at the naval ob
servatory from the imputation of Cannon's
remarks that they were not qualified by
scientific attainments for the positions
they held at the observatory. The work
of the observatory was done in large part
by naval officers and wholly supervised by
them.
Cannon, responding, referred to Robrn
son's statement that the nautical almanac
was compiled by naval officers, and quoted
from the legislative, executive and judi
cial appropriation bill the paragraph ap
propriating for the salaries of computers
in the office of the nautical almanac. "Are
these naval officers?" he asked.
Cannon, recurring to the item of appro
priation under discussion ($2500 to com
plete the quarters for observers, author
ized by law of March 2, 1895), said his in
tention had been only to call attention to
what he believed to be a matter of misad
ministration, but now that the question
had gone so far he would give it as his
judgment that the Naval Committee,
under the substance of the rules of the
House, had no jurisdiction of the appro
priation, and that it should not be in the
bill.
Boutelle vigorously responded that the
gentleman had set up his judgment
against the whole House on a matter that
had, ever since he had been in the House,
been committed to the Committee on
Naval Affairs. He did not suppose the
committee was particularly jealous of the
right to appropriate a few hundred dollars
for building these quarters, but as chair
man of the committee he emphatically re
pudiated the right of the committee to re
port back to the House a matter spe
cifically reportfid to it by the vote of the
House itself. It was a monstrous proposi
tion, and aimost trifling with the time of
the House to discuss ths matter.
Boutelle then followed Robinson in
eulogizing the scientific ability and
achievements of naval officers. He said
they included some of tho ablest and
brightest scientific men in the civilized
world.
Cannon retorted with some heat that
when he undertook to exercise his un
doubted right as a representative on the
floor, and to ask a question regarding an
appropriation which he might deem un
wiee or inexpedient, he did not propose to
be lectured for it by the gentleman from
Maine. He objected to being put in the
position'of seeming to criticize or antagon
ize the naval force. The officers were a
magnificent lot of men, whom he honored;
they were men fully educated in naviga
tion and the command of ships, "and I
want 'em to stick to their business," he
said. "Their business is not upon the hill
yonder."
The subject was passed with no action.
Having disposed of the bill, with the ex
ception of the paragraph providing for
new ships, the committee rose, and at 4:50
o'clock, on motion by Boutelle, the House
adjourned until to-morrow.
CHANGES IN WARSHIPS
Suggestions to Secretary Herbert
by the Naval Board of
Construction.
The Massachusetts and Oregon to Be
Improved and the Chicago to Be
Reconstructed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â An
important meeting of the Naval Board of
Construction was held to-day, and as a re
sult several recommendations for changes
in warships will be sent to Secretary Her
bert.
A request from the Cramp Company of
Philadelphia that they be allowed eighteen
months' and twelve months' extension
of time for the completion of the battle
ship lowa and the armored cruiser Brook
lyn was laid before the board. The Cramps
made the claim that they were entitled to
the extension on the ground that the orig
inal drawing? for gun supports and the
roller paths for turrets were changed by
the Navy Department more than a year
after the contract was awarded. This rea
son the board considered good and decided
to recommend to the Secretary that the re
quest be granted.
The board also decided to recommend
that the forward compartment of the
battleships Massachusetts and Oregon
(now practically ready for transfer to the
Government) should be divided into an
upper and lower section, no that in the
event the lower becomes filled with water
the upper compartment will be secure.
The plans for the reconstruction of the
cruiser Chicaco were laid before the
board. They propose to increase the deck
protection over the bows and clear to the
stern, thus giving tne vessel a protective
deck and to change her spar plan so as to
take away all her heavy top hamper.
These plans were approved, and it was
also decided to replace the present arma
ment with fourteen five-inch rapid-fire
guns.
A recommendation was also agreed on
that the horsepower of the vessel shall be
increased from 5000 to 9000, thus giving
an increase of speed from fifteen to eigh
een knots an hour, and also providing
space for 300 tons of coal additional.
If these desires of the board of construc
tion are carried out it will take about two
years to turn the Chicago into a new
vessel. The appropriation for that pur
pose contained in tne naval bill reported
yesterday will be adequate for the work.
A CARLE TO JAPAN.
The Project Diacussed by the Senate
Foreign .Relation* Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25â The
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
to-day discussed the project for the con*
structiqn of a cable to Japan by the way of
Honolulu briefly, and set apart next
Wednesday as a day for the final disposi
tion of tnis subject. A bill has been
drafted embodying the best features of the
two measures before the committee, and it
will be left for next Wednesday to deter
mine which company shall be named in
the measure. The majority of the com
mittee appear to look upon the Scrymser
proposition as the most favorable.

UNCLE SAM FAILS TO SEE IT.
The Commission at Washington Awaits
With Interest New Additions to
the Evidence.
LONDON, Eng., March 25.â A Parlia
mentary paper was issued this afternoon,
entitled "Err,ata in the Venezuelan Blue
Book." The first emendation of the text of
the Blue Book is of the extract; from the
secret reports on the dominions of the
King of Spain In America, addressed to
the Spanish Government (page 5), which
reads:
"It appears tbat the Dutch settlements
in Guiana extend from close to tne river
Amazones to the Orinoco." This passage
is amended to read : "It appears that the
Dutch settlements in Guiana already ex
tended from close to the river Amazones
at least as far us the Pomeroon."
The "errata" withdraws the version of
the Centurion's report in 1770 (page 14 of
the Blue Book) ana substitutes another,
affirming that the report sent home by the
Centurion inclosed declarations by the
prefect and three members of the Spanish
missions to the effect that the Spaniards
bad not then and never had any fort on
the Cuyuni. What the Dutch believed
were two forts in that neighborhood were
villages belonging to the missions on the
northern bank of the Yurur:. The paper
quotes parts of these declarations from the

THE COMMISSION AT WORK.
lte voting It* Time to the Study of Doc
umentary Evidence.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â A1l
the corrections referred to in the Parlia
mentary paper issued to-day refer exclu
sively to the argument usually credited to
Sir Frederick Pollock, which covers the
first forty- two pages of the British Blue
Book and do not affect the remaining 401
pages, to which the Venezuelan Commis
sion attaches much importance.
Ab already stated in the United Press
dispatches, Lord Salisbury thinks the cor
rections materially strengthen the British
side of the question. Professor Pollock's
argument, while considered to be an able
advocacy of the British contention as sup
ported by the evidence in the Blue Book,
has not the same conclusiveness attached
to it in Washington as in London, and the
Venezuelan Commission awaits with more
interest the promised additions to the evi
dence which is to be furnished in a supple
mentary paper. The commission is devot
ing all its time to the study of documen
tary evidence, and does not dwell upon
opinions, from whatever source they may
come.
SIR JVLIAN PAUXCEFOTIS.
â .
Improbable Story That He Is About to
Zieave for London.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.âMo
mentary credence was given in England a
day or two ago to a statement in tbe
Birmingham Pont that Sir Julian Faunce
fote was going to London to discuss
Venezuelan matters with Lord Salisbury,
because that journal is the home paper
of Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, and is usu
ally supposed to have an inspiration on
colonial matters from the Colonial Secre
tary of the Salisbury Government.
If there is any truth in the report, how
ever, the British Enibassador here is to
tally unaware of it, and those near him de
clare it to be absurd in view of the fact
that just at this moment numerous im
portant negotiations between Great
Britain and the United States are pro
gressing in a way that makes compulsory
the presence of Sir Julian Fauncefote in
Washington. Among these questions is
a Bering Sea claims commission, which
has been before the Senate for ratification
for over a month. In this connection an
embarrassment has occurred, from the
fact that the Senate in executive session
authorized changes in tbe convention as
agreed upon by Secretary Olney and Sir
Julian Pauncefote, which it is contended
embody an inaccurate version of quoted
passages from the treaty of arbitration.
Secretary Olney recently appeared be
fore the Committee on Foreign Relations
and, it is understood, asked that the
original wording should be restored.
Then there is the boundary convention,
for making convenient points on the one
hundred and forty-first meridian in
Alaska, for which Congress appropriated
$75,000 in a joint resolution approved Feb
ruary 20, 1896, the understanding being
that this work oueht to be accomplished
at the earliest possible moment.
In addition to these matters there is the
general arbitration treaty of which so
much is heard and so little definitely
known, and the Venezuelan limited arbi
tration, which occupies the serious atten
tion of both Governments. From none of
these matters would it be possible for Lord
Salisbury to withdraw Sir Julian, even
temporarily, without injury to all the
great interests affected, as not one of them.
is understood to have reached a stage
where it may be left in charge of un
familiar hands.
HyOLAXI* WA.XTB JPJBACE.
Deairea an Anglo-American Court of
Arbitration.
LONDON, Eng., March 25.â Rieht Hon.
C. T. Ritchie, president of the Board of
Trade, in a speech at the dinner of the
Association of Chambers of Commerce
this evening said, with reference to the
difficulty existing between the United
States and England, that he believed the
solution would be found in friendly arbi
tration within limits meeting the approval
of the nation. The Government, he as
serted, would be glad if a permanent
court of arbitration were estab
lished, by which difficulties arising
between the United State 3 and British
governments might be settled without the
possibility of a conflict between the two
navions. Mr. Ritchie said there were now
before the United States Government pro
posals proceeding from Lord Salisbury
which he hoped would result in such a
solution of the trouble.
THE PACIFIC ROADS.
Progress of the Joint Committee Billâ A
Vacancy for Which Maguire Is
Being Urged.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25.â The
Call correspondent was informed to-night
that toe joint committee on Pacific Rail
roads had made considerable progress in
the formation of a bill, and that, briefly
stated, it is drafted on the lines of the
Smith-Frye bill.
It is understood that the friends of Judge
Maguire and opponents of the Pacific
roads refunding scheme will make an
effort to have him appointed on the Pa
cific Railroad Committee to succeed Boat
ner, whose seat has been declared vacant,
it is not considered probable that Speaker
Reed will assign so radical an anti-raiiroad
man to this place. Besides. Mr. Boatner
expects to be re-elected to Congress in May
and is anxious to retain his place on the
committee, and it is not unlikely that
Speaker Reed will await the outcome of
the special election in Louisiana before
making this committee appointment.

tight compartment by a bulkhead, thus
reducing the chances of flooding the entire
compartment.

STEWART AND THE TYPOS
Washington Printers Looking
Into the Status of " The
Silver Knight."
The Populist Senator From the Silver
State Accused of Employing
Non-Union Men.
NEW YORK, March 25.â A Sun special
from Washington says: The Typographi
cal Union of the District of Columbia has
ordered an investigation of the relations
that exist between Senator Stewart and his
employes in the office of the Silver Knight,
the weekly newspaper which he started a
year or so ago, and which has now reached
a circulation of over 60,000. This large cir
culation is due largely to the fact tbat
every person who joins the Populist or
ganization known as the Silver Knights
becomes a subscriber and contributes 50
cents a year toward the support of the
Senator from Nevada, who is not only the
editor and proprietor of the paper, but the
supreme executive of the organization.
The paper bears a Washington date line
and the editorial and business offices are
here, but all the work is done in Alexan
dria and it is charged that the removal to
the antiquated city was to| a void thejrules
of the Typographical Union and allow the
leaders of the People's party and friend of
theworkingman to employ "scab" labor
at wages of $5 to $6 a week, when he
would be required to pay from $18 to $25 a
week for the same work in this city under
the union rules.
Senator Stewart admits that he removed
his plant to Alexandria for economical
reasons and because the men can live there
more cheaply, where rents are only about
one-fourth as much as they are in Wash
ington ; but he does not see why the Typo
graphical Union should object. He says,
moreover, that he employs none but union
printers.

A. P. A. SECRET SESSIONS.
Ihe Organization Reported Flourishing and
Preparing for Active Work in the
Coming Campaign.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 25. -The
executive committee of the advisory board
of the A. P. A., which has been in session
at the National Hotel here, adjourned to
night to meet fn New York next week.
The meetings were secret, but under
authority from the committee, Secretary
Dunn of New York said, after the adjourn
ment, that the reports received and con
sidered showed a great increase in mem
bers and that councils of the order existed
in every State and Territory of the Union,
including Alaska.
Plans were made to-day for sending to
these councils the secret action taken by
the executive committee. This secret
action embodies instructions as to the
part the councils shall take and the work
they shall perform in the coming National
campaign.

and demerits of every probable and possi
ble candidate for nomination before the

ventions were discussed. Mr. Dunn said
that nothing derogatory to t hese candidates
was mentioned, and that no action was
taken with reference to any of them. He also
said that reportÃ showing the status of the
representation of the order politically
proved that there will be A. P. A. repre
sentatives in both the Democratic and Re
publican National conventions. Copies
of the proceedings of the meetings will ba
sent lo the A. P. A. councils secretly.
Tbey will not even be intrusted to the

THE IRON HOOK DID IT.
Driven From Her Victim by a
Plucky Woman With a
Pitchfork.
CROWDS OF EXCITED PEOPLE.
Three Wagon -Loads of Policemen
Could Do Nothing but Clear
the Streets.
CHICAGO, 111., March 25.â W. H. Har
ris' big elephant Gipsy became unmanage
able at its winter quarters on the West
side this afternoon, and before she could
be got under control killed her keeper,
tore down a frame building and created
general excitement which drew thousands
of people to the scene.
Harris 1 circus is quartered at the corner
of Robey and Jackson streets in a six
story brick building, and Gipsy occupies
the greater part of the first floor. Her
regular keeper is Bernard Shs-a, but Snea
is at present engaged at a music-hall in
Omaha and the animal was temporarily in
charge of Frank Scott, a lion- tamer. This
afternoon Scott, against orders, took
Gipsy out for a ride in the alley. Gipsy
did not seem inclined to stop at the bound
ary of the alley and Scott gave her a jab
with an iron hook. The beast became en
raged, and throwing her keeper from her
head proceeded to pound him with her
trunk and succeeded in killing him.
Mrs. Harris came to the rescue with a
pitchfork. She was knocked down, but
pluckily recommenced the battle, and the
beast ran toward the end of the alley.
Here was standing a large crowd, and
many were the bruises received in the
scattering which took place when the
elephant started out of the alley. Gipsy
did not go far out, but went back for Scott,
who, in the meantime, had been moved
into a wooden building just opposite the
elephant's quarters. The animal knocked
in the whole side of the building in her
efforts to get at the man again.
During" this time Harris had sent for
fifty loaves of bread. The elephant
quieted down somewhat while she
was eatin?, and and after she had
finished, walked into the barn and
the heavy door 3 were shut. The door
had no sooner been closed than the ele
phant shattered it and ran out again. By
this time every street in the vicinity was
crowded with excited people. Three
â¢wagonloads of police came to the rescue,
but did nothing further than to keep back
tlie crowd. The elephant had her own
way for about four hours, when she went
to her stall and allowed Claude Orton, a
horse-trainer, to chain her. Harris has
owned the animal for five years and has
had no trouble with her before.
Frame Scott's right name is unknown.
Although he has been with Harris' circus
for six years no one knows anything of
him except that he went under an assumed
name.
HER SEVENTH VICTIM.
The Viciou* Brute I* the Old Empress
and Has a Sad Record.
OMAHA, Nebr., March 22. â Bernard
Shea, the former keeper of Gipsy, the ele
phant who created so much trouble in
Chicago to-day, was seen to-night and will
take the first train for Chicago in the
morning to assume his old position. In an
interview he stated that Gipsy is only
another name for Empress, the original
old Empress, the first elephant imported
into this country, and that the killing of
her late keeper Scott makes the seventh
victim of her vicious character. Tue first
was Harry Cooley in 1870 at Forepaugh's
winter quarters. Then George West had
the lite crushed out of him in 1874, travel
ing on the road with Robinson's show.
"Jimmy the Bum" was the next man, at
New Iberia, La., 1882, followed by William
Devoe with O'Brien's show at Poughkeep
sie, N. V., in 1886. Patsy Hulligan was
the sixth victim, and he had his arm torn
out in Cincinnati in 1894 and "he died two
days afterward.
Shea has been Gipsy's keeper off and on
for the past ten years and says he has
never had any trouble with her.
SANTA CRUZ FIOXEJsR GOXE.

Stricken by Death
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 25.â Uriah
Slack, father of Judge Charles W. Slack of
Department 5 of the Superior Court at San
Francisco, died at his home in this city
this morning of complications arising

SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 25.âDur
ing an altercation at Eighth and X streets
about 10 o'clock this evening Charles P.
Lynch was stabbed in the right breast in
the vicinity of the heart by R. J. Hanlon.
The weapon used was a shoemaker's knife
with a blade five inches long, fitted into a
rude wooden handle. Hanlon does not
deny the cutting, but claims that he acted
in self-defense when set upon by a gang.
The wounded man tells an entirely differ
ent story, and claims that the cutting was
entirely unprovoked. Had the blade of
the weapon not struck a rib Lynch would
have been instantly killed.

PHCENIX, Ariz., March 25.â A deal has
been consummated by which the telegraph
line belonging to the Santa Fe, Prescott
and Phoenix Railroad Company between
Phoenix and Ash Fork passes into the
hands of the Postal Telegraph Company.
This change is of great importance to the
business men of Phconix, as it will give
them the advantage of through rates and
will save the tariff heretofore charged for
the short line. It is probable that the
Western Union will now run an extra
wire in from Maricopa, and thus give
Phcenix the advantages of a second
through line.
SCOTIA'S FATAL QUARREL
The Killing of Hugh Hadden to
Be Investigated by the
Authorities.
Not Satisfied With the Verdict of
the Coroner's Jury Acquitting
His Slayer.
EUREKA, Cal., March 25.â W. S.
Wright, who killed Hugh Hadden at Sco
tia a few weeks ago by hitting him on the
head with a ratchet from a carbreak,
is not going to escape accounting for his
deed as easily as was at first supposed.
I Many people have not been satisfied with
the verdict of the Coroner's jury, which
acquitted Wright on the ground of self
defense. To-day a warrant was sworn
out, and District Attorney Bnrnell left
this afternoon for Scotia to investigate the
affair.
Hadden did not die immediately from
the effects of the bkcv he received, and
during the time of unconsciousness no
particulars of the homicide could be ob
tained. The authorities of the company
for which both men worked acknowledged
that they knew something of the affair,
but absolutely refused to talk about it.
W. S. Kapple was the only witness to the
affray, and he saw it from a distance.
Wright claims that the trouble com
menced in the oil-house near the mill,
when he asked Hadden to assist him in
raising a tank of oil onto a low platform.
Hadden refused to help Wright, and in
going out the door applied a vile epithet.
Wright objected and Hadden returned and
struck him. An encounter ensued, in
which Hadden struck Wright on the
shoulder with an oil-can. Then, picking
up a peavy (a heavy, wooden bar having
a cant-hook attachment near one end with
an iron pike inserted), he made for Wright,
threatening to kill him. Wright dodged
the blow, and catching Hadden by the
throat made him desist.
Three time;', says Wright, Hadden at
tempted his life with the peavy. The last
time he was threatened by Wright with a
grade-bar. Hadden left, but came back
again threatening to kill Wright the first
chance he got. Wright had a ratchet
wheel from a car-brake in his hand and
when Hadden came at him let it fly, hit
ting Hadden on the head, fracturing the
skull. Hadden relapsed into unconscious
ness and never regained his reason.
Hadden was a comparative stranger at
Scotia, having been there but a month.
He was apparently about 48 years of age,
was a Master Mason of Mount Moriah
Lodge, of Shelton, Wash., and a member
of the Vancouver Council of the Canadian
Protective Association.
Wright is the electrician at the Pacific
Lumber Company's mills at Scotia, and is
well known in this county. He has al
ways borne a good reputation.
EUREKA RAILWAY JBOSDED.
itonahue Road Relieved to Have Secured
a Local Apur.
EUREKA, Cal., March 25. âIt was
rumored here to-day that the Eel River
and Eureka Railroad, a local line extend
ing about thirty-five miles south from
Eureka, had been bonded for ninety days
to San Francisco capitalists interested in
the Donahue road, and that it would not
be long before steps would be taken to con
nect the two roads. The railroad promo
tion committee promises important news
soon concerning the California, Oregon
and Idaho line, which is to connect Ked
Bluff with Eureka. It is thought that as
soon as a movement is made to connect
Eureka with San Francisco, steps will be
taken to give access to thÂ« Sacramento
Valley.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 1896.
SAYS CALIFORNIA
IS A PARADISE
Mr. Depew's Opinion of the
Land of Gold and
Oranges.
ON A RECREATING TRIP.
Declares the Vanderbilt Party
Is Not Inspecting the
Central Pacific.
POLITICS AND FUNDING BILL,
Morton the Probable Choice of His
Partyâ The Pacific Roads
Situation.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 25.â The
special train bearing Cornelius Vanderbilt,
Chauncey M. Depew, John Hone, a New
York banker, and George R. Fearing of
Newport, R. 1., pulled into the Southern
Pacific's Arcade depot at 7:45 o'clock this
evening, and after a brief stop proceeded
to Santa Monica, where the party will
spend the night. A small party of rail
road men, a few personal friends of Dr.
Depew and a Call correspondent were on
hand to greet the visitors. The first and
only one to alight from the train was Mr.
Depew, who was soon surrounded by a lit
tle group of admirers, whom he proceeded
to entertain in his inimitable and original
manner. The frequent bursts of laughter
which reverberated through tde depot
showed that Chauncey was loaded as usual
with good stories and was regaling his
hearers with the witticisms for which he
is so famous. "Well, you have the call
on me," said he to The Call's representa
tive, "and I suppose I'll have to talk, al
though Mr. Vanderbilt wants to keep out
of the newspapers as much as possible. In
fact, there is no need of much being said
of our trip, as we are simply here for recre
ation and our visit ha*s no business signifi
cance at all, except such as may result i
from the broadening of our knowledge of
this great country.
"Neither Mr. Vanderbilt nor myself has
ever been in California before. You know
we New Yorkers are so well satisfied with
ourselves and our local habits that we do |
not travel about much. You in the West
here have come to look upon us as a lot of
selfish millionaires, bloated bondholders
and rapacious goldbugs. This view of us
has become so pronounced that we have j
almost begun to think it is true and that I
! we are the only people ana part of the !
country worth concerning ourselves |
about. But Mr. Vanderbiit and I finally j
came to the conclusion that we would j
break through our crust of exclusivenesss
and see California for ourselves, belieting
that in doing so we would get into closer
touch with the people of this great State,
learn to appreciate your more wonderful
resources and possibilities and go back to
our work invigorated both in body and
mind."
"But, doctor, you do not appear to be
in need of any invigoration," was sug- i
gested.
"That is true so far as my physical man I
is concerned, for I manage to keep my
youth despite an accumulation of years.
I honestly think that I perform more S
work than any half-dozen other men in }
the country, but I am able to do it because I
my habits are regular and I sleep much
and well. Still I get tired of work some
times, and I already feel refreshed by this
trip.
"Here we are three days out from New
Orleans, and the whole journey has been I
a constant delight and revelation. By the i
way, the Southern Pacific Sunset route is i
a magnificent line. The roadbed is solid j
and smooth and everything indicates that
the road is managed by competent hands.
We enjoyed our ride over it very much.
We had our view of Southern California j
farms and orchards this afternoon, and to j
say that we are delighted is putting it
mildly. We are enchanted. We expect
to remain about ten days in the State.
After visiting all the principal points of
interest in Southern California we will i
proceed to San Francisco, which I suppose |
you Westerners think is at least the hub !
of the solar system, taking it for granted I
that Boston can make good her claim of
being the hub of the universe. 1 under
stand that Los Angeles lays claim to being
somewhat of a hub herself. I will be bet
ter able to judge as to that after I see the
town to-morrow.
"No, our visit has nothing to do with
the prospective ownership or control of
the Central Pacific. We have been offered
lots of things for sale since we struck
the West. Ranches, mines and railroads
galore are shoved at us, each with the as
surance thnt it is the opportunity of a life
time to make a fortune, but we are not on
the buy. The Vanderbilt system reaches
as far west as Salt Lake City, and may
some day tap the coast, but we are not fig
uring on extensions now. We have a
traffic agreement with the Union and Cen
tral Pacific that is quite satisfactory to us,
and our only interest at present is to see
those roads well and safely managed, so
that we can route our coast traffic over
them to advantage to ourselves and our
patrons.
"Personally I think the proper solution
of the Pacific roads question is some sort
of a refunding act. I have not kept well
informed on the bills now before Congress,
but I dare say that some bill which would
secure to the Government the money it
has loaned the roads would be better for
the Government and better for the people
than foreclosure and Government owner
ship. I do not believe in Government
ownership. A Government road would
be badly run, for politicians would run it
and it would be run at a loss. Congress
would have to make np the deficit, and
then the New England States, in fact all
the States of the East and South, would
raise a protest because like sums were not
spent to aid transportation enterprises in
them. Eastern Congressmen would re
fuse to vote approppriations to ay Pacific
roads debts and the result can easily be
imagined. Owing to the poor service
which a Government road would give,
places leached by competing lines would
give their trade to them and places served
only by a Government road would find
their trade paralyzed."
Mr. Depew cited South America as an
example. There Government ownership
was tried and found wanting. As to the
excellent railway system of Germany
under Government control, he said the re
suit was heigher freight rates than this
country could stand. If the same rates
prevailed here, he said, not an orange or
a pound of fruit or grain could be shipped
from California to the Missouri River at a
profit. Under the Gorman system of rail
road management the great prolific Wesi
would still be a desert waste.
'"You can say," said Mr. Depew, in con
cluding this subject, "that we are not look
ing for an opportunity to buy the Central
Pacific All we Want at present is the
most efficient line to California, via the
Union and Central Pacific under private
management.
Changing the subject to politics, the
after-dinner orator began by saying:
"McKinley certainly shows the greatest
strength in the race for the Republican
nomination. He will undoubtedly go into
the convention with the most votes, but
not a majority on first ballot,, mind you.
Nor is he liable to get a majority on any
immediate subsequent ballot, for there
are other formidable candidates, not the
least of whom is our own respected Gover
nor Morton. There is a great probability
that there will be a long-drawn-out contest
in the St. Louis convention, and that Mc-
Kinley, the prime favorite, will have to
give way to a compromise candidate.
Now, the strongest man for a safe compro
mise is the one who can carry the most
important doubtful State. Can any one
doubt that that State is New York, and
that Morton is the man to carry it? He is
a man without animosities and who will
be acceptable to all factions. McKinley is
friendly to Morton, and so are all the
leading aspirants, nearly every one of
whom will throw his strength to Morton
when his own chances become hopeless.
Thus, in my opinion, Governor Morton's
ultimate nomination is almost an assured
fact."
"But in the event of Morton's failure to
seize the prize, whom do you consider the
most probable nominee?"
"There is no other, according to my
thinking, for we New Yorkers do not con
cede that our man can possibly meet with
defeat."
This ended the interview, as Mr. Van
derbilt, who during the entire stay of half '
an hour, did not once show his face out
side his private car, was impatient to be off
for Santa Monica. But Mr. Depew, before
swinging himself aboard the train, cracked
one more little joke at the expense of
Grover Cleveland.
"Just to show you how some men will
go wrong," said the prince of story-tellers,
"and refuse to embark on the tide of for
tune when it is at its flood, I will relate a
little incident about the present occupant
of the White House. Had Grover Cleve
land embraced the opportunity which I
once offered him, he might to-day be one
of our party, riding about the country in a
private car and enjoying himself, instead
of being a public servant, the drudge of
the White House, hated and execrated by
a large proportion of his fellow-citizens.
Why, I once offered to make him the head
of the law department of the New York
Central, but he chose instead to have him
self elected Governor of New York and
afterward President of the United States.
This only shows how men of brains even
will make mistakes."
SUICIDE AT LOS ANGELES
Repeated Attempts of an Aged
Man to End His Life hy
Drowning.
Second Plunge Into the Waters of a
Fond Accomplishes His
Desire.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 25.â A
most peculiar suicide occurred this morn
ing just outside the city limits on First
street. At this point there is a good-sized
pond. On the First-street side there is a
steep embankment, for ten or fifteen feet
the declevity being almost sheer. About
a month ago William Mertens, a man
about 70 years of age, was sent to Los
Angeles by his relatives in Yutan, Nebr.,
for his health. It appears that the old
gentleman was somewhat denientei, and
it was believed that the climate of this
section would tend to cure him in body
and mind. He was stopping with a
wealthy rancher named Herman Newman,
who resides at Prospect Park.
A few days ago, while passing by this
pond, Mertens sprang from tha wagon and
attempted to throw himself intoits waters,
but was prevented by the prompt action of
Newman. This morning Newman was
gain driving into the city with Mertens.
When opposite the pond Mertens told
Newman that he had dropped his spec
tacles and asked permission to get out and
get them. As Mertens had appeared to be
in buoyant spirits fora number of days and
was apparently in improved health New
man did not suspect his motive.
Mertens got out of the wagon and re
traced his way about fifty feet, looking
alone the road as thougn hunting for his
spectacles, but in reality searching for a
point on the bank of the pond beyond
which he believed she water was deep.
When he had come to that place he started
to go down the bank.
Newman, becoming apprehensive, had
also jumped out of the wagon and got
within two feet of Mertens, when the old
man sprang headlong down the bank into
the water. Newman grasped Mertens by
the coat, but in some way Mertens re
leased himself from the garment, leaving
it in Newman's hand?. All attempts at
rescue were in vain. Tlie man at once dis
appeared and did not rise again. The
body was recovered a half hour later.
TACOMA'S KING OF THIEVES.
Futile Attempt to Recover on a Worth
less Draft Floated by Paul
Scnulze.
TACOMA, Wash., March 25. â Eight
days before Paul Schulze, the million
dollar embezzler, committed suicide in
April, 1895, he drew two drafts on the
California Safe Deposit and- Trust Com
pany of San Francisco through the Bank
of .British Columbia of this city, the aggre
gate amount being $4862, and received the
cash. The drafts, on reaching San Fran
cisco, were not paid, as Schulze had no
funds on de posit, but there was no alarm
until the suicide occurred. When Schulze's
frauds were discovered Manager F. W.
Low of the Bank of British Columbia lost
his position.
What became of Schulze's money will
never be known. After Schulze's death,
though he had been living in princely
style, he was found to be practically pen
niless. To-day the petition of the bank
to be allowed a claim of $4860 against the
receivers of the Yakima Investment Com- >
pany came up for a hearing on the alle
*rition that Schulze had signed the bogus
draft as one of the receivers of the invest
ment company. This was shown, but it j
was proven that the receivers did not re
ceive the money and that Schulze had no
authority to make the drafts. The court
denied the petition.
It came out in the evidence that $2500 of
Schulze's ill-gotten gain was used to pay I
interest on old debts of the investment i
company, incurred when Schulze was
manager, and which debts he concealed.
Six hundred of the remainder was paid on
private debts. The remainder of the sum
is unaccounted for.

Steamer.
TEARS OVER A MESSAGE.
Receives a Dispatch Announcing
the Suicide of Fred

The Love-Sick Young Man Sought to
Touch the Heart of His
Idol.
PORTLAND, Ok.. March 25.-Mrs. Lillie
Strauss, tte wife of "Doc" Adolph Strauss,
and a woman well connected in San Fran
cisco, some months ago separated from
her husband here for alleged infidelity on
his part, and returned to the coast me
tropolis. Recently she came back for the
purpose of.effecting arrangements of some
unknown purpose with her husband, but
when he heard of her coining he hurriedly
left for the bay, accompanied, it is said,
by a young woman, Zella Rummel of Al
hina. The following telegram from As
toria this afternoon would indicate that
Mrs. Strauss made the bt^st of the situation
while here ;
"When the steamer Queen arrived down
from Portland yesterday morning on her
way to San Francisco, a messenger-boy
was waiting here with a telegram for
Mrs. Strauss, one of the passengers. When
she opened the telegram and had read it
she burst into tears, crying out:
11 'Fred had killed himself, and it is all my
fault. 1
"She fell over on the floor of the cabin
cabin in a faint, borne ot the lady passen
gers revived her, arid with tenrs running
down her cheeKs she told her story of do
mestic woes. She said she had been en
gaeed to be married to Fred V. H. An
drews, one of the most popular young men
in Portland, but they had quarreled and
she had broken off the engagement and
had told him she would go to her former
home in San Francisco. He saw her off
on the steamer and tried to persuade her
to remain and marry him. He threatened
to shoot himself if she did not. She was
disconsolate in her grief, and, leaving her
trunks on the steamer, she came ashore
with the intention of going back to Port
land toat'.end his funeral.
"As the telegram d.d not say that the
shooting had resulted fatally she wired the !
lady whosename was signed to the tele- j
gram asking if Fred would live. A reply \
soon came, saying that she had seen Fred |
this morning, and that ahe thought he
would. Other telegrams passed and it was
found that the man had not shot himself,
but ihat it was all a joke â a very cruel one,
though â and that he had sent the original
telegram himself. She will return to
Portland, while her trunks are on the
Queen, en route to San Francisco.
"The Jady is Mrs. Dr. Strauss of Sim
Francisco, whose recent troubles with her
husband and her leaving him are well
known on the coast, owing to t eir being
aired in the papers. She has been in Port
land about a month and there she met
Andrews. They immediately became at
tached to one another and were constantly
together."
UXCLE SAM A LOSER.
IHaaatroua Henult of the Seizure of an
Opium Smuggler.
PORTLAND, Or., March 25.â The seiz
ure and sale of the famous old opium
smuggling steamer Hayiian Republic by
the .b'tderal authorities will net but little
to the Government. The steamer was
libeled as an opium smuggler, and was
supposed to be the property of the Mer
chants' Steamship Company. On being
condemned by the Government at auction
sale she brought $16,000. At this juncture
the Kodiak Packing Company put in a
claim for $11,000, alleging that it was the
first owner of the Haytian Republic, hav
ing sold the vessel to the Merchants'
Steamship Company and that there was
that amount due from the latter on the
purchase price.
United States District Attorney Murphy
committed this claim on tne gronnd that
if the Kodiak Packing Company had any
recourse it must be from the Merchants'
Steams-hip Company and not from the
Government. Secretary Carlisle, however,
holds a differsnt view, and has sent to the
District Attorney orders to turn over to
the Kodiak Packing Company the amount
claimedâ sll,ooo. Inasmuch as the Gov
ernment has been to the expense of over
$5000 in caring for the steamer during the
time it has been in the Government's
hands there is a debtor balance accruing
from the seizure.

PEACE AT MILL VALLEY
Excitement Has Subsided After
the Furor of Tuesday
Night.
The First Engine Run Over the Dis
puted Avenues and to the
Power-House.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 25.â The
wild excitement of last night has subsided j
and at noon to-day the first engine was j
run over the track of the Mill Valley and ;
Mount Tamaloais Scenic Railroad as far I
as the site of the proposed power-house on j
the Cushing property. There was no j
demonstration when the engine steamed j
across the avenue where for a week work
had been delayed on account of Maurice
Windmiller's injunction. A crowd assem
bled, but none of the cheering that marked
the event of the first flatcar being pushed j
over the disputed avenues last night j
greeted the engine, as with steam escaping
from every valve it made its way over
Blythedale avenue, through the Mclnnea
property and over Corte Madero avenue to
the Cushin* property.
, All through the day the men have been
at work strengthening the track and lay
ing more rails. Last night the supply of
spikes ran short and in consequence the
track was in a weak condition until rem
edied to-day. No time is being lost in
completing the road and the great block
ade of material which resulted from the
injunction suit is broken and tbe cars as
they arrive in Mill Valley are being un
loaded with all possible haste. A third
rail is being laid so as to allow the cars of
the North Pacific Coast road to travel as
far as^the power-house.
Judge Angellotti's decision dissolving
the injunction has not, as expected, de
cided the point which was considered most
importantâ who owns the Mill Valley
roads? This point is still in question and
may shortly be tested.
The secretary of the Tamalpais Land
and Water Company asserts that he will
tear, up any water pipe that any property
owner attempt 1 " to lay across* one of the
roads. The company he represents claims
to own all rights to the roads. Whether
the company has this power or not may
shortly be determined, as it is said an at
tempt to lay pipes will be made by certain
individuals to test the point.

FOR STANFORD'S MUSEUM
Three Hundred Varieties of
Fish Received From
Jamaica.
Several Species Heretofore Unknown
to Science â Work on the
Junior Annual.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 25. â An interesting collection of
fishes has been received by the zoological
department of the university. It com
prises about 300 different varieties and is
the work of Mr. Roberts, a missionary in
Jamaica. Several species are entirely new
to science, and will be named after the
discoverer.
Some of the fish are") very interesting.
One resembles a toad in appearance, an
other has bristles like a porcupine and is
called the porcupine-fish. The parrot-fish
is a bright green in color, while the anqel
tish is light yellow with large fins. The
ugliest specimens beloug to the branch of
scorpionidse or scorpion- fish. Dr. Gilbert's
specimens have not been opened yet, as
there is not enough alcohol at hand to
preserve them. The work of classification
will soon begin.
The last work on the Junior Annual is
being done by Editor E. M. Hulme '97 and
his able corps of assistants. The book
eoes to press in a few days and will appear
the latter part of April. The present in
dications are that this year's annual will
far surpass that of any previous class, both
in literary and artistic merit. It will con
tain poems by Edward Maslm Hulme,
Charles K. Field and Miss Winnifred
Harper, and will be illustrated by such
artists as R. K. Culver, Merle Johnson,
Miss Morton and Miss Hyde. Stories,
sketches, verses, photographs, humorous
scenes of college life, pictures of members
of the faculty and the usual interesting
"grinds" will make up the volume.
Baseball practice continues daily under
the coaching of Captain McLaine. The
usual method of batting flies and ground
ers to the men isemployed. Practice games
are played every few days, and the men
also practice batting the curves of Captain
McLaine. Tne makeup of the 'Varsity in
field is practically decided as follows: Mc-
Lame (captain), pitcher; Jeffs, catcher;
Young, first base; Harris, second base;
Sharp, third base; Taylor, shortstop. The
competition for the outtield is very active,
the principal candidates being Thompson,
Wight, Stansberry. Strohn. James and
Freeman. Wight and Sharp are tempo
rarily laid up, but will be prepared for work
in a few days.

CHICO, Cal., March 25.â That deadly
species of mushroom, the toadstool, has
been the means of partly depopulating tho
Asiatic element in Chico's Chinatown. As
a result of partaking of the fungus two
Japanese and three Chinese died to-day,
and there are quite a number who will
probably die before morning.
A Chinaman went to a slaughter-house
near town last Sunday and gathered a lot
of toadstools, which he supposed were
mushrooms. He peddled them out among
his countrymen and some Japanese, and
many partook of the luxury. On Monday
physicians were called to prescribe for
poisonine, and the doctors have been busy
night and day ever since. About a dozen
Japanese and Chinese were stricken down,
and earJy this morning the first Chinaman
died, followed later by a Chinese woman, a
Japanese man and woman, and another
Chinaman late this afternoon, making five
in all. The Chinese woman was not under
a doctor's care, and an inquest and autopsy
was held by the Deputy Coroner late this
afternoon. The verdict was that death
resulted'from accidental poisoning. Sev
eral other Chinese are lying at death's
door, and their demise is expected at any
time. A few have sufficiently recovered
to be out of danger.
The present warm weather has brought
out mushrooms and toadstools in profu
sion, and it takes a connoisseur to tell them
apart, the appearance oi the plants being
very similar.

SANTA BARBARA
STEALS EXPOSED
Ex-Manager of a Milling
Company Arrested for
Embezzlement.
ROBBED HIS EMPLOYERS
Three Charges Preferred Against
R. M. Watson as the Result
of an Investigation.
LOST MONEY IN SPECULATION.
Became Deeply Involved by Trying
to Recoup at the Expense of
Others.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 25.â
Since the resignation of the local manager
of the Southern Pacific Milling Company
it has been known that an investiga
tion of the company's books was being
made. To-day R. M. Watson, the late
manager, was arrested at the instance of
the company on three charges of felony
embezzlement, aggregating about $1200.
Watson was for seven years connected
with the South Mill and Warehouse Com
pany in this city, and when the business
and" warehouse of that corporation were
bought by the Southern Pacific Milling
Company in January, 1894, he was retained
as the local manager in place of F. H.
Wheelan, who took the position of active
manager in San Francisco. The new cor
poration did not take the accounts of
the old company, but offered to allow
its own agents to collect accounts for the
retiring company, thus leaving the latter's
books open. Watson was a trusted em
ploye and had full control in the local
management of the Southern Pacific Mill
ing Company's affairs. It seems that prior
to the time he engaged to serve the latter
company, and while in the employ of its
predecessor, he engaged in private specu
lations, buying and shipping walnuts on
his own account. He sustained heavy
losses in these speculations, and, according
to his own statement, thought to recoup
by using and appropriating funds belong
ing to -the Southern Pacific Milling Com
pany, covering these thefts by making
fraudulent entries in the' books, in the
shape of charees to different people. Wat
son is believed to have appropriated sev
eral thousand dollars. The exact amount
has not yet been determined, as it has
been found necessary to personally inter
view every man whose name is on the
books for a considerable amount to ascer
tain whether the entry is genuine.
The first notification received by the
company of the difficulty was in the shape
of a letter from Watson tendering his
resignation, and stating that he had
wrongfully used its funds, amounting to
|2600, to cover speculations made prior to
the time he entered its employ. This
frank confession, and the young man's de
sire to make restitution so far as it lay in
his power, together with the esteem in

in the Future.

â which he was personally held, disposed
his employers to deal leniently with him ;
but an inspection of the books convinced
them that all of the misappropriated funds
were not used to cover these old specula
tions, but, on the contrar.v, to engage in
new and disastrous ones. It is because of
this discovery, as well as of the larger
amount involved, that he is being prose
cuted.

NEWSBOYS' RESTAURANT.
A Choice Concert to Be Given for Its
Benefit.
To aid the Newsboys' Home at 113
Powell street, arrangements have been
made to give an elaborate concert on
Tuesday evening, April 21, at the Y. M.
C. A, auditorium. Special talent nas been
engaged for the occasion, many prominent
vocalists and others who would ordinarily
have secured large rates of compensation
having on this occasion volunteered their
services free. The programme will be an
nounced later.
The restaurant at 113 Powell street will,
it is thought, render the Newsboys' Home
self-supporting.
The management desires not only to
afford the homeless newsboy a place
wherein to sleep, but to give him a home
where his present welfare and ultimate
prospects will be considered. All the pro
ceeds of the restaurant are guaranteed by
the managers as destined for the home,
and it is desired to make it widely under
stood that the restaurant is open to the
public. A cheap and refined menu is
presented. All persons patronizing this
establishment are assured by those in charge
that they will receive good value for their
money together with the satisfaction of
knowing that their coin will help to make
"men" of the bright little newsboys, who
might otherwise drift into a wasted life.
A CENTRAL AMERICAN PIG.
Attracts Crowds, but Causes a Panic
Aniunif the Fair Sex.
The strange spectacle of a little brown
man leading an animal that seemed
to be half pig and half porcu
pine along Kearny street yesterday
afternoon attracted crowds on every
corner. It seemed to annoy the little man
and he savagely jerked the docile brute
through the crowd, muttering impreca
tions in a foreign tonsue upon the curi
osity of mankind in general, and in par
ticular upon those in the immediate vi
cinity.
It was ascertained from a small boy
who accompanied the pair that the ani
mal is a wild pig, and was recently
brought up from Guatemala by the person
leading it, named Martini. Its age is
about eight or nine months, and its size is
about that of a common pig of the same
age.
The bristles are very long and rather
fine and converge in a tuft to form the
tail. Down the middle of the back extends
a stripe of white about two incnes in
breadth, and a stripe of tawny hue runs
over the shoulders and down each slender
foreleg. Tne snout projects some three
inches over the under jaw and is rough at
the tip and coated with short, stiff, black
hair.
Every now and then tne inquisitive crea
ture would dodge to one side or the other
and sniff at the dainty skirts of some
fashionably dressed lady. The inevitable
result was "a horrified scream and a panic
stricken rout.
The little brown man and his queer
charge finally turned up Pine street, fol
lowed by a crowd of urchins, and was soon
lost to view.
A BARKENTINE RENAMED
The Sharpshooter Will in Future
Be Known as the Henry
Naupie.
Called After the King of Caroline
Islands, Who Is a Gool
Trader.
The old British bark Sharpshooter is to
have a new name. When she is refitted
and placed under the American flag she
will be known as the barkentine Henry
Naupie, in honor of the second chief or
Governor of the Caroline group.
For yeara the trade of these islands has
gone to Japan and England, but latterly
some San Francisco merchants have
trained a footing on the group, and now
the bulk of the commerce will como here. .
Captain Luttrell of. the Viking is now on
his way from the South Seas, and on his
arrival he will assume â  command of the
new vessel. In a letter to the J. F. Cun
ningham Company he says that the King
or Governor is very favorable to Amer-
icans and that he want 3 American goods
to reach the Carolines direct instead of via
Yokohama and London.
The Kin? has a store at Kiti harbor,
and is one of the principal traders in the
group. Of conrse, the Spaniards control I
everything, but nevertheless Henry Nau- j
pie does well, and is growing rich. He is
now one of the most influential men in j
the Spanish possessions in the South Seas,
and his word is his bond.
The vessel that has been called after him '
has had a remarkable history. At one |
time she was a clipper plying between !
Australia and Southampton. Later she j
descended into the conier stage, but, j
proving too small for that business, she â¢
became a tramp. Wherever a charter |
could be found there her captain went, |
and it was on one of these foraging expe- j
ditions that she happened to head for
San Francisco.
After taking a load of nitrate aboard
the bark was headed for San Francisco. I
In the Gulf of California she was die- j
masted, and the news of the disaster was |
taken ashore in a bottle set adrift by
Captain Watts. A Mexican tender picked
them up and towed the dismasted vessel
into port. The tug Fearless was sent from
here and towed the Sharpshooter to San
Francisco. Lawsuits followed, and the
vessel was finally sold to pay expenses.
bhe has been dismantled and is now in
the course of reconstruction. A number
of new plates have been put in and new
decks and hew masts are ready for plac
ine in position. When the repairs have
been completed the old bark Sharpshooter
will have disappeared and the barkentine
Henry Naupie will appear in the Ameri
can register.
Mistrusted Each Other.
One of the detectives who have been on
duty in Statuary Hall, watching the Mar
queite statue, had a novel experience the
other day. A Jady brought a policeman
into the hall and pointed out the detective
as a suspicious character. She said she
had been observing him for some time
and felt convinced that he harbored some
sinister design against the statue. She
was painfully surprised to learn that the
detective had been watching her with sim
ilar misgivings as to her mission in the
hall.â Washington Post.

engage a local violinist and musical di
rector of great talent and of more than
local celebrityâ Herr Hans Schuy. Herr

MISS WILLARD COMING
The Convention Will Not Be
Held, but She Will Tour
the State.
Miss Susan B. Anthony Instrumental
in the Withdrawal of the National
Temperance Convention.
The officers of the State Woman's
Christian Temperance Union received the
news of the withdrawal of the promise of
a National convention very quietly. The
news had been in a way expected.
The San Francisco County Board was
in session from 9:30 a. m. to 1:30 p. m. It
dealt chiefly with details in reference to
the work, but incidentally adopted the
following resolution :
Whereas. We have just received the dispatch
that the National convention is not coining to
our City, and whereas the cause of temperance
and woman suffrage need our labor more in
consequence; therefore
BtÃolved, Thai we double our diligence,
looking unto the hills whence cometn our
help.
The decision of the National officers of
the Women's Christian Temperance Union
was the result of diplomatic overtures to
that end made by women suffragists of
local and National note for a period ex*
tending over the past two months.
Miss Susan B. Anthony opened the nego
tiationsby writing Mrs. B. Sturtevant Peet,
president of the California Women's
Christian Temperance Union, stating that
if a National temperance convention were
held here it would greatly retard the prog
ress of the suffrage cause by antagonizing
the large liquor interests of the State.
The writer pointed out that the wise
course would De to make a long pull, a
strong pull, and a pull all together, for
female suffrage. After tnat "we shall see
what we shall see."
Mrs. Peet didn't see it that way and re
plied to that effect. Meanwhile Miss An
thony corresponded with prominent suf
fragists in this City, emphasizing her
views and advising that conferences be
held between representatives of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union
and the Woman's Suffrage Association,
with a view to a compromise at least.
Accordingly Mrs. Peet met officers of
the State Campaign Association at the
home of Mrs. A. A. Sargent. The views of
Miss Anthony were echoed by the suf
frage element and Mrs. Peet argued that
there was need of the convention and that
the cause of suffrage would be advanced
rather than hindered by it.
No decision was reached and another
conference was called, at which several
other officers of the union â¢ were
present. At this time (he suffragists
asked, as a compromise measure,
that the temperance convention ba
postponed till after the election. The
members of the union agreed to this and
took steps to acquaint the National officers
with the situation, signifying their will
ingness to mak2 the concession. They
held in these documents, which were
signed by all the State officers, that they
had agreed to disagree with their suffragist
sisters however in all other details respect
ing the convention, and asked that it be
held as promised. The suffragists sent
official documents, representing their side,
to the same tribunal and asking that the
convention be not heJd in the State at any
time this year.
The result of the deliberations of the
National W. C. T. U. officers in regard to
this difference of opinion was shown by
dispatches received at W. C. T. U. head
quarters last evening.
Miss Frances Willard, the Susan B.
Antiiony of the suffragists, notified Mrs.
Peet in a personal telegram that it was
deemed inexpedient to hold the conven
tion in California this year, nut that she,
and probably Lady Henry Somerset,
would make a lecture tour "through the
State this fall.
There is no denial at W. C. T. U. head
quarters that the news is a blow that will
be felt through white -ribbon circles, in
that it withdraws much of the stimulus to
local work. It is an added difficulty to
overcome, but they will press forward in
their work in all departments not except
ing woman suffrage.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Yachtsmen Applaud Ferris Hart
man's Jokes at the
Tivoli.
Ventriloquism at the OrpheumâOn
dricck- Materna Concert
To-Night.
The San Francisco Yacht Club's benefi t
at the Tivoli Ouera-house last night was
a great success, in spite of the threatening
weather. The theater was filled with
yachtmen and their friends, for not only
had the members of the San Francisco
Club attended in force, but delegations
from the California Yacht Club, the
Pacific, the Corinthian and the Encina!
yacht clubs also swelled the throng. .
The house was gaily decorated with
bunting, consisting of the signal codes and
the flags of the various yachts. Com
mander Gutte with a party of ladies was
in one of the lower procinium boxes and
in the box above were Commander Bruce
and a party of other members of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club. The other boxes were
occupied by John Lee and J. V. Coleman
with their respective parties.
Ferris Hartman interposed many jokes
into "Said Pasha," touching on local
yachting matters, and they were all re
ceived with laughter and applause. Be
tween the acts w stereopticon views were
shown of marine scenes of |the different
yachts in and around the bay. The
audience was very enthusiastic and en
tered thoroughly into the spirit of the per
formance.
"A MilK White Flag" closes its prosper
ous engagement at the Baldwin Theater
next Sunday night. On Monday James
O'Neill will open a season of two weeks,
during which he will give such produc
tions as "Monte Cristo," "Virginius,"
"The Courier of Lyons" and "Hamlet."
Edwin Milton Royle's "Captain Impu
dence" will run for the rest of the week at
the California Theater. On Monday the
comedy drama "Friends, " which suc
ceeded so well here last season, will be
produced by the Milton Royle company.
"Sinbad" continues to fill the Columbia
Theater. The bright up-to-date hits and
the catchy new songs are all adding con
siderably to the spectacular attractions of
the extravaganza, and the new people in
the cast have become almost as popular as
their predecessors.
New departures from the beaten track of
Irish comedy seem to be the fashion, and
Carroll Johnson's "Irish Statesman" is
one of the most successful efforts in that
line which has been seen here. The play
contains many stirring incidents, and is
tinged with a good deal of originality.
Johnson plays his part of the hero in a
very heroic fashion, and the rest of the
cast is quite satisfactory.
The Continuous Show is still proving a
drawing card for Grover's Alcazar. There
are some good specialties among the turns
and the farce ''Confusion" is one of the
most amusing features of the perform
ance.
Segournier, the accomplished French
ventriloquist, is the groat attraction at
the Orpheuni this week. Not that
other attractions are lacking, however.
Xorma Wills and Montie Collins arouse
â olentv' of merriment, and Frank La
the eccentric clown, is a host in
himself.
The tirst of the farewell concerts to be
given by the Ondricek-Materna combina
tion wiil take place at the Auditorium to
night. Herr Anton Schott, the Wagnerian
tenor, will appear here for the first time.

HOW RAINEY IS
GETTING THERE
He Is Rapidly Strength
ening His Grip on
the Junta.
BUSY DISTRICT BEES.
The Stable Man Is Trading Dag
gett's Mint Patronage
for Power.
WHY BRAUNHART WORRIES.
Rainey's Rapid Rise to Power Pre
sages Stormy Times for the
Junta Faction.
Sara Rainey is hustling like everything
to tighten his grip on the Junta organiza
tion, and by that token stormy times are
in store for the local anti-Buckley faction.
Rainey'3 mastery of the faction, which
the State Central Committee recognized as
the regular local organization, is conceded
by many of the anti-Raineyites themselves,
and is patent to all who know Sam Rainey
by his works and who know what is going
on in the local Democracy.
Of course, "Rainey," when spoken of in
this boss sense, includes Daggett some
what as the greater includes the less. The
shrewd stableman is handling Daggett's
local political forces, and Rainey directly
controls more votes :n the general com'
mittee than does the Superintendent of
the Mint, whose "pernicious activity" and
"offensive partisanship" have done much
to pile up more Democratic enemies, but
Daggett stands by his friend Rainey,
Rainey stands by his friend Daggett, and,
Daggett's power added to Rainey's is just
about the strength that is ready to rule.
Buttbeanti-Rainey faction of ti.e Junta
faction happens to control the machinery
through haying the officers and roromit
tees. That is a little bit like the minority
having the inspectorat a primary, in which
case the minority always wins. Chairman
Sullivan and Gavin Ale Nab have been run
ning things with the occasional assistance
of a few others like Sam Braun
hart, M. C. Hassett and Frank
Hughes, and Chairman Sullivan
is able to give decisions, appoint commit
tees, call or not call meetings, and so on,
in a way which gives Rainey decidedly
the worst of it. Rainey snirfs with su
preme contempt at these â¢'kindergartners"
who are trying to do politics, and calls
them names unfit for publication.
So Rainey needs a good strong majority
if he is going to get a Daggett delegation
sent to Sacramento, and if he is later to be
able to control things locally to his own
ends by forcing a compromise with Buck
ley or effecting other moves or combina
tions. Sullivan, backed by what is
partly in truth and partly in
aatiie called the "decent' 1 element,
is matching himself against Rainey, ex
pecting to checkmate him and be able by
a slender majority or by tricks and arbi
trary manipulation of affairs to carry the
faction through to victory in behalf of
â¢'political purity" and a few offices for the
decent element.
Rainey will see about this in that pecu
liar way of his. This is why he is nust
ling just now. He is reaching out for
votes in the general committee. One way
of getting them is by offering jobs in the
Fire Department. Another way is to buy
them with places in the Mint. Dag
gett has placed the United States
branch mint largely at the disposal of
Rainey to do local politics with. Sam has
long had a number of men in the Mint
and recently he has put some more there.
Six weeks or two months ago he put in
Eugene McFadden of ihe Thirty-eighth
District, "Billy" Williams oF the Thirty
seventh, and Tom Healey of the Thirtieth.
These are, of course, members of the
general committee, able to deliver to
Rainey other votes in their districts.
In the Thirty-second District the twenty
rive delegates to the general committee
are controlled mainly by "Tim" Donovan
and Frank Lester. Donovan is credited
with having twelve of the twenty-five who
are friends who will stand by him. It was
known yesterday to several that Rainey
has offered Donovan a place in the Mint
to come over to the Rainey side with his
friends.

when the Junta appointed its first geneial
committee last fall, and he was allowed to
name the twenty-five delegates to the
present general committee. He named
them. Opposed to Braun hart in that dis
trict is the large Rainey-Daggett element
in the Junta which was shut out, and, of
course, the Buckley element. Braun hart
is having an awful time trying to hang
on to the Twenty-ninth and keep it in line
for decency.
Rainey is scheming to get a lot of Braun
hart's men over. Among the twenty-five
is Jack Mannix of the old boss firm of
Mannix and Brady that Chri3 Buckley
overthrew when he first came into power.
Mannix is nnti-Buckley, of course, but he
is not expected to be anti - Rainey.
Another Kaineyite in that dele
gation is Louis Seelig, brother to
Nat Seelig, who has a job in the Mint. W.
T. Boyce, ex-Assemblyman, and now in
the customs service, is accredited to
Rainey by political gossipers, as are prob
ably J". M\ Quinn and J. K. Colbert. Wires
are being pulled on others through friends,
and so on, all of which is reason enough
that Sam Braunhart should be badly "wor
rited" and that many of the boys should
be wondering how the Twenty-ninth will
stand when Rainey digs a while in it.
Braunhart's men are nearly all new in poli
tics.
It is the saying that he "discovered" them.
He is playing in behalf of purity aeainst
all the Democratic politics of the good
old Twenty-ninth. This is merely a
sample of how Rainey politics are working
in eighteen districts. The lieutenants of
Rainey and Daggett are busy as bees.
Eddie Graney, who holds his entire district
solid for Sam, is bustling about making
friends and promises and dropping good
words for Rainey. It is reported that he
has hinted to the rieht kind of people that
Rainey is the man to make the boys at
this juncture. J. A. Fenton of the Mint is
rustling arouna "feeling' 1 and talking and
all the politicians of the Mint and Fiie
Department are at work.
Ed Lanigan, with nis sixty or so votes
in the general committee, is still lying low
and has made no alliance with either the
Hainey or anti-Rainey factions. He is
doing good politics and waiting for the
right time and place to drop. With Lani
gan in Rainey's camp ths "decent" ele
ment would bardlv make a quorum, and
just now Rainess control is reckoned
without Lanigan.
Senator Mahoney and Martin Kelly will
of course throw to* Rainey any help in the
line of either "pull" or "push" that is
needed and can be given.
It has been since the recent meeting of
the State Central Committee that Rainey
has laid hold so actively and risen so rap
idly and prominently as a re-enthroned
boss. The active portion of the local Dem
ocratic party is now arrayed with Rainey
and Buckley, and ihe quiescent portion is
just looKing on and holding noses.
It is quite an interesting spectacle to see
the old partners, Sam Rainey and Chris
Buckley, come back to town, and, rising
in might, battle for good government.
But.don't be a fool; "they'll be like that,"
so the fellows say, holding up two fingers
close together. Just wait until the earuc
is played out.
HOW THE CHILD THINKS.
Professor Barnes Says It* Mind De-
velops According to Rule.
The mind of the child, beginning with
infancy, develops according to definite
laws and in doing so passes regularly
through successive stages, regardless of ef
forts that may be made to have some of
them skipped over.
That was the central thought of Profes
sor Earl Barnes' lecture last night in the
hall of the Academy of Sciences.
His deductions were founded upon data
collected during the last few years by him
self and bis coworkers in the educational
department at Stanford University from
thousands of school children in California
and were substantiated by similar conclu
sions reached by special investigators in
the East and in Europe.
A little girt had been given some paint.
When her mother was downtown she
painted the parlor chair?, and on her
mother's return asked her to come in to
see how beautiful she had made them.
This story was submitted to over 20,000
California children between the ages of 6
and 16 for each to write what ibe mother
should have done with the little girl. It
was found that the youngest children sd
vocated corporal punishment, in many
cases of much severity and cruelty, while
the oldest children were the most lenient,
the proportion favoring leniency or mild
remonstrance increasing regularly as the
maximum age was reached.
A Diver's Experience.
The diver, as the reader may imagine,
gets many startling shocks when below. /
fifteen-root shark, magnified by the water
and coming direct for one, is sufficient to
make the stoutest heart quake in spite of
tbe assertion that sharks have never been
known to attack a man in dress. Neither
is the sight of a larse turtle comforting
when one does not know exactly what it
is; and the coiling of a sea snake around
one's legs, although it has only one's
hands to bite at, is, to Bay the least, un
pleasant.

IN THE SAN BENITO VALLEY THERE 19
a most picturesque little place which is cel-
ebrated for the excellence of its crops and the
sturdy character of Its native sons. One of
the good " lamilies of the place is that of the
Ashursts, the boys being well known for their
straightforwardness and manly bearing. In-,
deed, in that region" there is no one more re
spected. Some little while ago, however, one
of them (Robert) began to appreciate that all
was not well with him. I He did not pay muca
attention to the growing weakness that he felt,
thinking that it was only a passing ailment.
But here was where he made a serious blunder.
As his disease progressed he began to realize
that he was Indeed ill. He tried all that he
could do to shake off the attack, using all the
remedies that no knew of for that purpose,
but still it kept getting more and more nrml #
implanted in his system. Almost on the verge
of giving up, he wrote to the Hudson Medical
Instituteâ that great institution for the cure
of the sickâ and he at once got a letter telling
him that he need not despair. And now, after
having been under the skill of the specialists
there for a couple of weeksâ just fancy it, only
a fortnightâ he has been done so much good
that he frankly says that he would not bo
where he was just those few days ago for five
hundred dollars. Here is a letter that he has
seen fit to write to the management of the
great institute:

ANOTHER DAY OX MARKET STREET
There Seems to Be No Break in the
Steady Line of Ap
proval.
To tell the truth I was more than a little
bit surprised by the unanimity of opinion
â¢which was expressed by the half dozen or
so merchants whose interviews were pub
lished yesterday, giving their opinions as
to the merits of Joy's Vegetable Sarsa
parilla. The man who makes his living by
writing has experience in variety, and it is
not unusual for him to find one day a week
at least moderately easy wort, but to find
two days in succession of this sort of thing
is decidedly rare. But I have managed to
find two days at least that wei* spent on
''Easy" street.
I continued mv queries to the merchants
of the City yesterday by crossing over to
the other side of Market street, and there
the enthusiasm was quite as great as I nad
found on the north side. I chatted to a
half dozen people whose names I am un
able to incorporate in this article for lack
of space, and of those there was no sinele
one who had not a kind word to say for
the great home remedy, Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. Some, of course, were
humorous, feeling possibly that their per
sonal appearance scarcely warranted the
first question, "Have you ever used Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla?" Others were
serious and not only admitted having
done so. but in more than one instance
they were frank enough to say that it had
been used from necessity and that the re
sults from its use were altogether good.
It is a little bit difficult tojinduce a man
who has been known to have suffered from
a serious blood disorder and who i 8 gradu
ally but surely recovering his health to
give his name for publication, even about
the merits of the remedy which has saved
him from not only a disfigured counte
nance but possibly much worse ills. He
feels natural retioÂ»nce to the world know
ing that his blood has ever been impure,,
and really that is not surprising. None of
us are anxious to parade our ills before the
world.
And of those who were interviewed one
of them is a man who does as large a busi
ness in his particular line as any one in
the City. He is v man who has been in
business continuously here for overa, quar
ter of a century, and one wno has handled
in his business ov*r four millions of dol
lars, and who may fairly be quoted as the
type of the others who were eood enough
to give their opinions for publication.
Here are their sentiments expressed in
their own language as nearly as may be
possible, and it needs no "higher educa
tion" to understand just exactly now they
feel toward Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
MR. TITZMArRICK HAS HEARD.
I dropped first of oil into the gentle
men's iurnishing-gooils store of W. J.
Fitzmaurire. SIT Market street. Mr. Fitz
maurice was, as he ever is, in a good
humor, and to my query as to what he
knew as to the merits" of Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla be replied: "I don't use sar
yaparilla myself, for which, I suppose, I
have to eive thanks. I know, as well as I
presume the rest of the world knows, that
eood sarsaparilla is an excellent blood
purifier, and as I have never had occasion
to use it myself it goes without saying that
my blood has maintained a normal condi
tion; but I do know something of the
merits of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
An intimate friend of mine, who was suf
fering from dyspepsia, told me that he had
used" two or" three varieties or makes of
sarsaparilla, and that he found Joy's with
out doubt to be the best of all. lam sure
that my memory does not fail me when I
say that he was emphatic in his assertion,
and were he here at this moment I am
perfectly certain that he would give you a
testimonial which won id please you in
every respect. I hope the time will never
come when I may find my blood or my di
gestion out of order, but if it does I want
to say most distinctly that 1 shall certainly
use Joy's Sarsaparilla, because I am satis
fied from the statement of my friend that
it is an excellent stomach regulator."
Mr. Fitzmaurice is a native of New York
State and has been a resident of California
for about fifteen years. He has been well
known as a furnishiug-goods man for the
pasr three years in tbis City, and his store,
while not the largest in the City by any
means, invariably contains the latest styles
in everything that enables a man to dress
correctly. Moreover, it is not unfair to
state that Mr. Fitzmannce believes in
making a moderate profit on everything
that he sellsâ and only a moderate 'profit.
He is as courteous in his treatment of the
man who spends a dollar in his store as of
the man who spends fifty. In a word, he
is a gentleman.
A PORTLY JANITOR OF THE NEW PARROTT
BUILDING.
One can scarcely pass the new Parrott
building without looking into it, for it
will assuredly be one of the great sights of
the City when finished. There is a sign
on the temporary door which clearly indi
cates that "people having no business mit
dis bouse will please git oud." but think
ing that it might be possible that I might
have some business with some one in that
small domicile, I ventured to pull open
the door, and not in a very gentle way,
either. I was confronted by J. P. Ma
earthy, the sturdy janitor who guards the
entrance.
"What is your business, sir?" queried
Mr. Macarthy.
"Well, I was just looking in," I replied.
"Yes; I am aware of that," retorted the
gentleman with the Irish name.
"Weil," I went on, "I want to interview
s "me prominent people as to the merits of
the great home remedy, Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla."
"Do you wish to interview me?" said Mr.
Macarthy, and continued, "for if not, I am
afraid that I cannot allow you to go far
ther."
it was somewhat pleasing to find the
iolly-looking janitor so faithful to the
duties which he is paid to perform, and so
I thought I would interview him on the
merits of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. He
tnlkeU reasonably and with that modera
tion which insures respect. Said Mr.
Macarihy : "1 shall always speak favora
bly of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I do
not novruse it myself, but I have heard it
indorsed time and time again as having
done much good, and should the time ever
come whan I need a sarsaparilla, there is
no quest on at all in my mind but that I
should use Joy's. And farther than that,"
he raid, 'although I do not remember no
tbat I could give you with certainty the
names. I hive heard many people speak of
;t a* havin*done them much good." And
I left tire gefcial janitor feeling sure that I
bad met one" of nature's noblemen.
MR. OtJLufcraOS STRONGLY APPROVES.
A few yards larther up the street I was
struck by an attractive display of carpets.
Tne display was not in the window, but in
the interior of the store. On either side
were ranged rÂ»Hs of various grades and
many styles of carpets, but what parti
cuiariv struck my eye was tne artistic way
in which the various patterns had been
placed. I sain â some genius has either
done this or superintended it, and so I de
cided to go in. It was the store of Gulliz
son Bros., 955 Market street. A gentle
man clean of eye and of intelligent coun
tenance met me and asked me if he could
"be of service to me." I said, "Yes; I
have been detailed to inquire from a few
of the leading merchants of the City wnat
they think of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
May I ask what your name is?"
"My name is Hans Gullixson," he re
plied.
"You are a member of the firm?'' l
queried.
"I am, sir."
"Do you know anything of this
remedy?"
'â¢I do, for I have used it."
"Now, will you please tell me, Mr. Gul
lixson, what your candid opinion is as to
its merits or demerits. If it has done you
any good tell me so; if you have not found
it a'salisfactory remedy also please state
that fact, and* just tell me in the way
you would talk for publication, for I shall
quote your own words."
"Well," replied Mr. Gullixson, "I have
used Joy's \ egetable Sarsaparilla, prefer
ring it to all others, and I have found it ex
ceptionally good as a spring medicine, but
in addition to that it has undoubtedly
helped my kidneys. I don't imagine that
it is a cure-all, nor do I suppose that it is
sold as such, but lam certain (as I speak
from my own experience) that it hastened
my stomach up, and done a good deal to
help a! slight kidney affection from which
I suffered. It is in "my opinion a most ex
cellent remedy, and I" have no hesitation
whatever in indorsing it iv the highest
way." Now. that is a plain, straightfor
ward statement of the experience of one of
the nicest and cleanest business men in
San Francisco.
The firm of Gullixson & Bros, has no
"cardboard" reputation. Since its estab
lishment some eighteen years ago it has
been their constant endeavor to sell ex
actly the class of goods which they repre
sented that they carried. The millionaire
and the man of moderate means alike
appreciate the tieatment which they re
ceive at the hands of thi3 excellent con
cern. Your purse will possibly be able to
afford a pure Brussels carpet. If it does,
there is no better place to go for it than
Gullixson's. That is generally admitted,
but even should you feel that it would be
extravagant to get anything dearer than
common matting you may go t0 955 Market
street with the same confidence, and you
will find that you get as good treatment as
does the man who has a pocketful of money
to spend.
THE MAN WHO HAS HANDLED TOfR MILLIONS.
Four millions of dollars is a larger sum
of money than one can appreciate well.
It would even take along time to count in
one hundred dollar bills; still that and
possibiv it ore is the amount of coin which
Sir. Solomon, the well-known wholesale
and retail butcher, whose immense place
extends from 960 t0 979 Market street, has
passed through his hands during the time
that he has been in business in the City.
But large sums of money do not disturb
Mr. Solomon. He is a man of capacity or
his vast interests would scarcely be so well
looked after as they are by him. He at
tends personally to all the smallest de
tails, and while his meats stand positively
higher in the market (not higher in price)
than do those of any other large dealer, he
has been enabled to place his business on
such a basis that he can cater equalJv well
to all classes of meat-buyers. Asked as to
his opinion of Joy's Vegetable Sarsapar
illa Mr. Solomon said: " I always patron
ize home products, but in the instance
of which you speak I should patronize
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, whether it
was a home product or not, unless there
was a Californian sarsaparilla which could
claim to be equally good, and it would
have to substantiate its claims, too," he
continued, "for I do not believe that there
is anything of its nature that is equal to
the home remedy, as you call it. Friends
of mine indorse it highly. They say it is
a good blood purifier. They say it is a
good spring medicine, and they tell me it
is good for dyspepsia, too, and I quote
these expressions of opinion from people
whom I can trust. Why, indeed, some of
them I could trust with my checkbook.
"Shall I commend it, and do I commend
it? Why, most certainly." And ttien
this genial purveyor of many of the good
things to be found in the world turned to
busy himself about one of the many varied
interests that occupy his capacious mind
from day to day.
in j. reid's cozy shop.
After leaving "the man of millions" I
"tacked ship," as the mariner puts it, and
started toward the ferry. I was attracted
by the face of a somewhat benevojsnt look
ing gentleman standing in the door of the
tailor-shop, 907 Market street. Tnere were
some rare, pretty patterns to be seen and I
lingered for a moment, then of a sudden it
struck me that I had better be doing what
I was paid for doing than gazinc at spring
styles, which, cheap as they possibly might
be, could have no possible interest for me,
the bank account being lacking. Why
should I not interview Mr. Reid, who
owned the pretty suitings which had at
tracted my attention? And one qnery
elicited the fact that he was the kindly
faced gentleman to whom my attention,
too, had been drawn.
"Mr. Reid," I began, "will you please
tell me as to whether you ever used Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla?"
"I have not," he said.
"Do you know anything about it, as to
whether it is a good remedy or a bad one?"
"I have heard it spoken of a good deal
but I don't think I could justly give you an
opinion as to its merits." Standing op
posite to him was a tall gentlemanly-look
ing man with a light auburn mustache,
exceptionally well-die?.Â«ed, with a good
humored smile on his countenance, and
the bearing of a much traveled man. He
interjected: "Mr. Reid, don't you know
anything of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla?
You will pardon my interrupting you
when you were talking to a newspaper
man, but if you know nothing of it, I am
afraid that I will bave to confess that you
are not quite as well informed us I sup
posed you to be." Mr. Reid did not resent
the interruption at all. He said, "I was
simply telling the gentleman who was in
terviewing me the truth."
"That is all I wish you to do," I put in.
"Well," continued the handsome man, "l
don't care to be quoted in this matter, but
lam a traveling salesman. My business
taKes me from New York to this Coast
three or four times a year and I have heard
even on the cars Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa
rilla spoken of in the highest terms. What
do they say about it? They say it is the
best tonic/and the best cure for that 'tired
feeling' in the world. 'Tired feeling' is a
very old expression and gentlemen of
the road are not supposed to indulge
in anything stale, but I tell you
that there is such a thing as a
'tired feeiing,' and lam fair enough to
admit that I have heard more times than
I have got fingers and to?s that Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla is the best remedy
for this sort of thing. They say that it is
the best sarsaparilla on earth." Then the
handsome man twirled hiÃ luxuriant mus
tache in an eminently well-satisfied sort of
way and remarked, "They siy that men of i
the road invariably exaggerate, but I have
certainly managed to tell the truth for
once."
This seemed to be a very fitting finish to
the interviews for the day. It was genially
expressed and evidently sincere, and while
it is possible that the festive drummer, as
he is commonly known, does at times
"pull the long bow," he is universally
recognized as beins; one of tbe most
straightforward, honest men on earth
when his particular line of goods is not in
question. It seems more than passing
strange that one should be able to go and
find on a great thoroughfare like Market
street at haphazard so many good, square
business men indorsing Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla, and it only proves more con
clusively than ever that it is one of the
discoveries of the age. As one gentleman
put it, "It's the onry thing which does all
good and no barm, and it does good every
time." That surely seems to be the gene
ral opinion of tbe leading merchants of
San Francisco. William Chenhalls.

THE QUICK AND THE DEAD
The Judges Declare Bets Off
on a Race Taken by Sir
Richard.
A VERT POPULAR DECISION.
Coady, the Rider of the Favorite, Ca
brillo, Suspended Pending Farther
Investigation.
The judges on the stand at the Bay
District track turned the cathode ray on a
race yesterday, and the result of the ex
periment will be eagerly awaited by the
race-going public. Cabrillo, with Coady
up, opened a pronounced even-money
favorite for the sixth event, a five and a
half furlong dash, bat did not appear to
be in great demand and receded in the bet
ting to Bto 5. In his previous races the

horse has received his preparation' at the
hands of Wilber Smith, the Sacramento
horseman, but on Tuesday Owner Van
Brunt turned the racer over to the tender
care of the wizjfrd of the Lone and Cam
bridge stable, William Murry. He -was
ridden in yesterday's race by Coady, he of
the Wheel of Fortune-Hidago finish fame,
and wound up fourth. Possibly that was
the best he could do, bnt the officials in the
stand thought differently and declared all
bets off amid great cheering in the betting
ring.
The trainer had received permission
from the judges to work the horse on, and
he ran a very creditable mile. Coady was
suspended pending the X-ray develop
ments. This is half of the story, but two
halves make a whole. The elastic gray
horse Sir Richard won in hollow fashion.
Time was when this gray horse was con
sidered a most consistent performer. He
runs in the name of F. V 7. Taylor, but ru
mor credits him â with being the prorjerty of
another roan. Some weeks ago the gray
sprinter was taken np to the ranch of B. C.
Holly and imbibed of the waters of that
magic spring that caused Revolver, Judge
Terry, Sympathetic's Last and Montallade
to be. so afflicted with specd â at times.
On his return to the scene of racing
operations Sir Richard ran a couple of
mellowy races. Yesterday he opened up
at 5 to 1, and dry-goods boxes and step-lad
ders were called into requisition in the
scramble to reach over the heads of the
rabble to hoist the big bundles of coin into
the hands of the unsuspecting bookies.
Tod Sloane, who was once under suspicion,
but now riaes only to win, piloted the
gray horse to victory, but Professor Roent
een's wonderful discovery upset calcula
tions. Poor Coady !
Otherwise the racing had a very healthy
look. To be sure the favorite had a rough
time of it, but that is to be expected.
Lumina, who captured the two-year-old
event, and Starling were the only first
choicers to pass the wire in front.
Ex-jockey Joe Flynn's mare Starling,
backed from 5 down to .",â .,, made all the
running in the opening race at seven fur
longs and won easily from Malo Diablo.
Twelve maiden two-year-olds started in
the four-furlong scramble. It soon devel
oped that Lumina was the good thing.atcn
of money forcing her odds down from twos
to 6to 5." Shields had the tilly in front al
most from the jump and she won by a
length in :49>^. Early Notice and St.
Dunstan fought it out for the place, the
former taking it by a head.
The mile handicap saw the 4to 5 favor
ite Rosebud succumb to defeat. After
trailing Flashlight until well straightened
away in the stretch tne favorite showed in
the lead, but when challenged by Rey Del
Bandidos was beaten out rather easily by
a length.
The seven-furlong run over the inside
course resulted in the usual dump. De- |
cision was played as though the race was
already over, going to the post 4 to 5.
Tonino, a 15 to 1 outsider, haa the favor
ite's measure from the start and taking the
lead going down the hill showed the way j
home, passing the wire a length in front
of Pollock. The first choice was but a
head further back.
The black horse, Hidago, was downed in
the one and a quarter miles seliing affair.
Collins, the 11 to 5 second choice, took the ;
lead turning down the backstreteh, and
despite (.'horn's hard riding on Hi
dago, who was heavily played at 4 to 5, Dr.
Rowell's deceptive traveliug brown geld
ing captured the race cleverly by over a
length in 2:09Â»^.
For the concluding event, a seven-fur
long run, Charley McDonald ruled a 4 to 5
favorite. For the greater portion of the
way fog obscured a view of the horses. At
the end Fairfaith, a 5 to 1 choice, won
cleverly by a neck from Flirtilla.
Track and Paddock Items.
Ed Tipton, secretary of the Kentucky
Breeders' Association, who is attending to
the managerial part of the Montana rac
ing circuit, was an onlooker at the races
yesterday.
Collins changed hands at the conclusion
of the mile and a quarter event. It was a
seliing affair, and when the brown geld
ing, who was entered to be sold for $600,
was put up at auction, Ed Games bid him
up to SIUJO, and Dr. Rowell let the ani
mal go.
The announced starters with their
weights for the Burns stake are as follows:
Lovdal 108, Pepper 110, Fortuna 97, Vine
tor 112, Installator 111, Wheel of Fortune
106, Tnornhill 101, Santa Bella 97, Miss ;
Brummel 92, Crescendo 107, Service 115, '
Silver State 88.
The judges thought Lloyd put up a sort
of listless ride on My Sweetheart, and set
him down for thirty days.
The victory of Fairiaith at his second
essay was a most unexpected one â last,
then first.
The number of pencilers booking in the
ring is steadily diminishing. Yesterday
but thirteen cut in.
Garnet Ferguson, son of the starter, and
Bookmaker Barney Schreiber engaged in a
wordy tilt in the betting ring yesterday.
On Tuesday Barney's jockey, Chora, rode

OPPENHEIMER TO RETURN
Director Morse Says It Is Unjust
to Deem Him an Ab
scond er.
The President's Dwelling and House
hold Furniture Seized by
Creditors.
George E. Morse, one of the directors of
the Northwest Milling and Power Com
pany, Washington, was interviewed with
regard to the affairs of the company and
the alleged absconding of President Simon
Oppenheimer, at the residence of his
father, 711 Leavenworth street, last even
ing.
Said Mr. Morse: "The bonded indebted
ness of the company is $300,000. Outside
of that the liabilities consist of money bor
rowed to build the flourroill and the saw
mill and*m electric light plant. This is
said to be $100,000, but 1 think it is nearer
$200,000. This Mr. Oppenheim borrowed
personally, with the expectation of selling
stock in the future to the value of $200,000.
"He has gone East to try to sell the
stock, and he says that he will not return
until he has done so. I think, however,
that he will return, if he fails to sell the
stock, inside of sixty days. He owns
three-fourths of the stock, and if he could
sell one-half his share, he would have
ready money to operate the company.
"The company owns twenty-seven acres
of land in the neart of the city, with water ;
runnin? through it, which, in its lowest
stage, will produce 35.000 horsepower.
This is divided up into five channels,
through which the water flows, and is
composed of solid lava rock. About $425,000
has been expended by the company. It j
is considered by experts to be one of the
finest mill ani power propositions west of
Niagara.
"The two mills already built are of
granite. The flourmill is seven stories
high, and has a capacity of 12,000 barrels
daily. The sawmill is a three-story struc
ture, and can turn out 60,000 feet of lum
ber every ten hours. They are said by ex- i
perts to be the finest mills of their capacity
in the United States.
"Mr. Oppenheimer did not abscond,
as some have suggested. He is as
honest a man a3 I 'ever met. He has
fone East simply to try to sell the stock.
'o my own knowledge, he took only a
valise containing a few necessary articles
and enough money to defray his expenses
there and back. He has claimed nc* ex
emptions whatsoever and made no assign
ment. His creditors have now come in on
him in his absence aud taken everything.
He did not even endeavor to dispose of his
dwelling and they have taken that. Tiiey
have even taken possession of his house
hold goods and furniture."
"Do you think that he will succeed in
selling half his share and getting the com
pany into working order again?"
"Well, everything is now in the hands of
a receiver and is being operated by him.
This will be a serious handicap to dispos
ing of anything. I am.not very sanguine
of success."
"Where is Mr. Oppenheimer now ?"
"He is in New York. As I said before,
I expect him back inside of sixty days."
Mr. Morse signified his intention of tak
ing up his residence permanent! v in San
Francisco. If the company should recover
its footing, however, he will probably re
turn to Spokane.
Mr. Morse's wife is a daughter of the lat*
David McKinley, Consul-Geueral from
Hawaii to this port, and a niece of ex-Gov
ernor Wlliiam McKinley of Ohio.

blossoms, and the floral posts were twined
with pale blue satin ribbons. On the
mantel was a bark of forget-me-nots.
It was beneath this floral canopy with
the forget-me-nots for a background
that the young couple stood while Dr.
Voorsanger read the expressive Jewish
ceremony.
In the other apartments the decoratious
were as daintily pretty and original, and
showed the hand'of ttie artistic decorator. Miss
Bates. The hall was decorated with long
stemmed lilies and growing palms. In the
diningroom was a novel decoration of wistaria
and lilacs. Hanging in the bay-window was
a Chinese chlckencoop of wickerware filled to
overflowing with purple lilacs;, suspended by
ropes wreathed in wistaria. In adjoining recep^
tion-room, from ropes oi Beauty of Glassenwood
roses were suspended beautiful baskets tilled to
overflowing with the beautiful pale yellow
roses. For the west drawing-room the decora
tions were composed entirely of the exquisite
floral offerings sent by the friends of the
happy young couple.
The bride wore an elegant gown of white
duchesse satin, elaborately trimmed with lace.
Miss Minns Schwabacher, the maid of honor,
was attired iv a dainty gown of grenadine and
carried a bouquet of forget-me-nots.

THE IDEAL HOME.
Anna Shaw Says Mothers Rale the
World Only While it Is ia
the Cradle.
Rev. Anna H. Shaw lectured last night
at the California-street Methodist Church
upon the home. l T nlike many of the
lecturers on this topic, the speaker de
plored the lack of fatherhood in the fam
ily institution. The homes of America
call not so much for women government
as they do for more attention and care from
the nominal heads of them.
The reverend lady then drew a picture
of the father at home with that Chinese
wail, the newspaper.heldup oeforehiiu be
tween his family and himself. The father
of this country gives everything to his
children but himself.
"loncesawone of the greatest men of
our country," said she, "talking with his
son in the most confidential manner. Â£
was struck with the spectacle, and said,
'Sir, you two appear to get along well to
gether.' 'Yes, he answered, 'I and my
boy are the best of friends.' I like to hear
of the father's part of the rearing of the
boy. I once went to a Boston noonday
prayer-meetine, and heard ail of the large
number of business men there tell iiow
the influence of their mothers made them
what they were. A lady present said to
me, 'Those mothers must have lostjtbeir
husbands early as I haven't heard that a
single father had anything to do in raising
those boys.' I would rather see a boy
reared in a home where there was one
father than in a home Where there were
several women.
"The saying that 'the hand that rocks
the cradle rules the world,' is true only
while the world is in the cradle. The lit
tle fellow soon gets out of it and then
there is work for some other than the
cradle-rocker. When women make a busi
ness of the home life then will we have
the best type of fatherhood, the best type
of motherhood and childhood. When the
home becomes the caucus of the country,
when patriotism springs from that spot,
then we will rear ideal citizens."
A FATAL ACCIDENT.
Death of an Old Lady Who Was Bun
Over by a Buggy.
Mrs. Sartorus, a widow, aged 71 years,
and living with her son at 531 Ellis street,
died at the German Hospital yesterday
morning. She was run over at the corner
of Turk and Hyde streets on the evening
of March If!. The wheels of the buggy,
which was drawn by one horse and driven
by a man unknown, passed over her body.
A rib was broken and the woman was
otherwise injured.
George ijartorus. son of the deceased,
reported the case at the Coroner's office
yesterday and an investigation will be
held. Tne physicians who attended Mrs.
Sartorus do not think that her injuries
were sufficient to have caused death. The
excitement that followed the accident, it
is thought, had much to do with hasten
ing her end, as she was advanced In years
and in a feeble physical state.
Sternberg Declared Guilty.
The jury in the Sternberg case last night re
turned a verdict of guilty.

THE CALL SPEAKS . FOR ALL.
The Junta has a hunted look.
There are signs that Rainey intends to
lose McNab as soon as he gets him in the
woods.
In the coutest with Democracy this year
the only thing the Kepnblican party has
up its sleeve is a laugh.
Mills of Texas may be a fool on the
tariff, but he talks the best kind of com
mon-sense on the Cuban question.
Democratic politics this year is an open
gaa>e of free trade in bosses with no pro
tection anywhere for the better element.
The combination of Rainey, Kelly and
Maboney undoubtedly makes a boss firm,
but it will never be able to fill a political
contract.
Something seems to have gone wrong
with Congressman Boutelle at this ses
sion. He is always playing a lone hand
and he never plays it well.
The proof that the ttepublican proces
sion has taken to the straight road, is
found in the fact that all the crooked fel
lows are dropping oat of it.
Some people in the festival counties are
quietly watching the battle of the ballots
for queen, but most of them are hustling
for the ballots of the battle.
The Morton movement in New York has
been started well, is headed right and will
undoubtedly get to St. Louis with strength
enough to cut a wide swath.
There were enough McKinley men in
the New York convention to make a mo
tion, but they lacked a great deal of hav
ing strength enough to keep it moving.
Senator Davis may be the favorite son
of Minnesota, but in the Sate convention
somebody heaved a brick at him and the
subsequent proceedings interested him no
more.
According to all miners who return from
Alaska there is a great deal of gold in that
country, but the man who hopes to get it
out must have a great deal with which to
start in.
Senator Mills would have Uncle Sam
say to Spain, "Give Cuba local self-gov
ernment or I will," and in such a remark
there would be DO bullying and a good
deal of business.
The appearance of Rainey, Kelly and
Mahoney in one combination is" such a
queer deal as to suggest the possibility
that Buckley may have had something to
do with the shuttle.
It cost New York about $110,000 to re
move the snow blown into the city by the
blizzard of the 16th and by the time the
job was done another blizzard came along
and blew in some more.
By requesting our Navy Department to
make tests of the armor-plate they have
purchased in this country the Russians
have paid us a compliment and escaped
the cost of paying for the tests.
The fact that a Fresno vineyardist has
begun to predict a speedy beginning of the
millennium may be taken as pretty fair
evidence that rabbits are dying out and
the raisin crop is looking well.
Congressman Barham was right in tell
ing the Pacific Roads Committee "The
people of California are almost unani
mously opposed to any sort of a refunding
bill." That is exactly the sentiment of
the State.
In all Republican conventions of the
year the principle of reciprocity is placed
side by side with that of protection, and it
is made certain that the great policy of
Elaine has become the permanent heritage
of the party.
Judging from the comparative amount
of public attention shown to tbe two stars
in the Vanderbilt-Depew combination now
coming west, it is clear the American peo
ple think ten times of brains where they
think once of money.
The appointment of Senators Frye,
Brice and Wolcott to draft a funding bill
for the Senate is very good for the rail
roads and not altogether bad for the peo
ple, inasmuch as it gives fair notice of
what we may expect.
The ease with which Chauncey Depew
can mauage the performance of arduous
labor is made evident by the fact that
when he travels thousands of miles to
look after railroads and attend to politics
on the side he calls it recreation.
Bayard was right enough in saying at a
recent banquet, "Amsnmnst not be ex
pected to speak in a tone that will suit
everybody," but that is no reason why an
Â£mbassador should sDeak in a tone that
dosn't suit the country ne represents.
White has been always regarded as an
emblem of peace, but in the present con*
troversy between the W. C. T. U. and
Eallington Booth over the use of a white
ribbon as a bade* it is likely to become
the sign and symbol of a mighty racket.
The New York Republican platform is
virtually summed up in the sentence," We
believe in a business administration of the
Government by business men on business
principles for the benefit of the business
interests of tnis ttreat people." Those who
do not like that platform can vole for the
re-election of Cleveland.
EAIITEY'S NEW SCHEME.
The success of the Republican party in
the National contest is so well assured, it
is natural .the people should pay more
attention to local politics than is usually
given at this season in years that are to be
marked by Presidential elections. It is for
this reason the public is more interested
now' in the faction fight of the City
Democracy.thaii.inany speculation as to
whom the Democrats will nominate for
the Presidency. In the National contest
there is no danger, but in the local contest
there is enough to arouse the minds of the
taxpayers and put them on their guard
against any possible combination of the
bosses.
The most notable feature of the local
situation, is the hght which Rainey is
making to obtain in City politics for the
future that supremacy which Buckley
abused in the past. In the conduct of this
light he has shown how well he profited
by the lessons heJearned when he- was one
of the trusted lieutenants of the old boÃs
against whom he has now turned with all
the bitterness that can be engendered by a
combination of greed and ingratitude. He
has made canning use of McNab and the
Junta to down the Buckleyites, and is now
evidently arranging a combination by
which he will be able to drop the Junta
I and stand forth as the supreme boss.
To effect the combination needed to as
sure his power it is natural that Rainey
should turn to Martin Kelly and J. H.
Mahoney. Nominally these men do not
belong to Rainey's party, but really they
are men of the same type, belong to the
same gang a~nd practice the same kind of
politics. Kelly and Mahoney, having
been baffled in their attempt to gain con
trol of the Republican organization in the
Fourth District by means of forged proxies
and other tricks of a similar kind, are.
more than ready to stand in with the
Democratic boss Â»nd render service for
service on almost any terms he pleases.
That the combination of these bosses
implies considerable danger to the better
element of both parties in the City cannot
be questioned. Rainey's heelers will help
the Kelly and Mahoney Ran,"; in the Re
publican primaries, and the favor will be
returned whenever the Democratic pri
maries are held. It is to this complexion
the local situation has come. Democracy,
hopelessly divided between Buckley and
Rainey, has no chance ia redeem itself
this year. The Republican party, by
forcing such fellows as Mahoney and
Kelly out of their assumed leadership, has
aroused against it all the force of what is
known as gang politics both in its own
ranks and in those of the new Democratic
boss. It behooves the people therefore to
ba on their guard. The Rainey, Kelly
and Mahoney combination is liable to be
dangerous if it ever becomes strengthened
by a single victory. It must be crushed at
the start. _______________^
THE HOTEL MANAGEES.
Tbe visit which leading hotel managers
of the East will make to California in the
latter part of next month will be a far
more important event than might be
supposed at a glance. It will be the an
nual business convention of one of the
strongest associations in the United States,
but the occasion will be employed also to
see the sights and enjoy the beauties of
California. The men composing the body
are able and responsible members of their
several communities, and necessarily come
in contact with a greater number of people
than any other class of business men.
Being themselves professional enter
tainers, they will be alert to the spirit and
manner of their treatment In California.
They should not for a moment be con
founded with the organized bodies who
visit the State and accept every generous
attention as a matter of course. They
know the trouble and expense of such
royal entertaining as California indis
criminately extends to all visitors and will
appreciate it accordingly.
The importance of these considerations
should not be lost sight of in the prepara
tions for their entertainment. Although
the hotel-keepers of California are famous
for their generous hospitality, and al
though these visitors will be their special
guests, they should not be permitted to
bear the whole expense of a royal enter
tainment. It would be difficult for citi
zens and organized bodies generally to ex
hibit too much liberality. The gathering
will be more valuable than any other that
could be brought hither.
Although the latter part of April iÂ« not
the most attractive part of the year in
California, being in advance of the regular
fruit season, we shall have much to offer
the visitors. Our wines and dried fruits
should be given every possible oppor
tunity to make their excellencies known.
The quantity of these articles consumed
in the hotels of the Eastern States is
enormous, and we have but a meager hand
in supplying the consumption. Poor
French wines still rule the cellars, and
they command a much larger price than
ours. Our dried prunes, figs and apricots
are the best in the world, and they are
comparatively unknown in Eastern hotels.
Our canned fruits should be advanced to
attention in all their superb beauty, as
articles of that kind are largely consumed
in hotels.
The travel -which hotel-keepers are in a
position to influence is a very important
consideration. As yet California is' re
garded as an excellent winter resort,
but little is known of the fact that it is a
superb summer resort as well. This refers
to climate alone; other natural charms
exist in abundance. Even the industries
peculiar to the State have a grace all their
own, and they should be brought to the
attention of the visitors.
SOCIALISM AND LABOE.
The.Executive Council of the American
Federation of Labor is holding a meeting
at Indianapolis for the purpose of sifting
the complaints received from the labor
federations of New York, Omaha and San
Francisco that socialism is insinuating
itself into the ranks of labor and endeavor
ing to use labor organizations lor advanc
ing that doctrine. The dispatch announc
ing the fact indicates very clearly the
determination of the federation to check
the tendency in its incipiency. The infer
ence is drawn, however, that the federal
tion opposes the movement solely on the
ground of an attempt' to use the labor or
ganizations for the advancement of a par
ticular political idea, and does not go to the
merits of socialism in its relation to the
interests of the labor classes. It is in
tended merely that the American Federa
tion of Labor shall not be made the in
strument of any political movement.
This is both a wise and .a conservative
position. It leaves the individual mem
bers of the federation free to uphold what
ever political doctrines they may prefer
and to concentrate the energies of the or
ganization on the legitimate purposes of
its being. These are sufficiently broad
and deep to engross all the attention of
the body. Should the organized laborers
of the country be drawn iato a political
movement they would be setting them
selves up as a class. That would be fatal,

the equality of all. Class politics is the
beginning of revolution.
The fact that there ia probably a strong
sentiment of socialism in the labor ranks
creates a temptation to embrace socialism
as a political doctrine. But socialism has
not yet become a serious factor in Ameri
can politics, and there is a powerful senti
ment which regards the republican form
of government as sufficient to meet all the
demands of the people for such a common
sharing of public benefits as will produce
a safe balance between the power of the
Government and the freedom of the people
and regulate it. Socialism thrives beat in
those countries whose people have the
least to say in the direotion of govern
mental affairs. It is far more philosophic
to make a good republic on the present lines
by causing it to be a reflex of the best sen
timent among the people than to charge
it with being the author of ills for which
it is not responsible.
THE PANAMA SQBSIDY.
Mr. Huntington's anxiety with regard
to the funding bill does not withdraw his
alert oversight of the isthmus route. It is
clearly evident to him that if the isthmus
of Panama were in a position to compete
freely with his overland routes it would
possess an enormous advantage in hand
ling those classes of freight which need
not be hurried and which ordinarily do not
command a high rate of transport. Be
fore he secured a controlling interest in the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company, which,
with its Panama Railway connection, was
an annoying competitor for traffic between
the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard, he paid
that company a heavy subsidy to keep out
of the fight. This was in the shape of a
charter for space which he could fill with
freight or leave empty, as he chose. TM3
is a notorious fact of history.
But the Panama Railway remained a
thorn in his side even after he had secured
a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail.
j It was the most stubborn and independent
1 little conoern that he had ever encoun
tered. He finally convinced it that an
agreement would be better than a fight
and thus induced it to withdraw its sttam
ers running in competition with the Pa
cific Mail, on the understanding that the
overland traffic would be fairly divided
among the railroad, the Pacific Mail and
the Panama Railway. No sooner had he
bound the little company under a contract
than he advanced overland rail rates 50
per cent. This meant a corresponding ad
vance for the isthmian line.
The Panama Railway soon discovered
that it was getting nothing like its share
of business and that the Sunset route of
the Southern Pacific, with its line of
steamers from New Orleans to New York,
was carrying an abnormally heavy traffic.
Then the Panama Railway rebelled, as
serting that there was somethine wrong
with the differentials stipulated for in its
favor. These differentials had been ad
justed on the old basis of open competi
tion and hence were satisfactory, but for
some obscure reason they failed to bring
business as formerly. Another singular
circumstance was that although the Pa
cific Mall bad been similarly hurt it made
no complaint. Whether the Panama
Railway got an inkling of the familiar
system of private rebates which in the
past had made the Southern Pacific popu
lar with many shippers, and which had
helped to fasten it as a monopoly on Cali
fornia, cannot be known. It is certain
only that the Panama Railway rebelled.
Then came a repetition of the old story
of the Pacific Mailâ the Panama Railway,
according to latest accounts, has been
promised a subsidy. The contract having
! failed to make it a party to the monopoly
it must be paid to Keep quiet. California
may take what comfort it can from the
reflection that this- subsidy for the
strengthening of the Southern Pacific mo
nopoly will be charged to its industry.
AMERICAN SEAMEN.
Senator Frye has at last introduced his
promised bill requiring tnat the officers of
vessels registered in this country shall be
American citizens. These include the
master, the engineer and all his assistants
and all persons who command a watch,
They may be citizens either through birth
or naturalization. Provision is made
whereby such persons who are not conve
nient to the inspecting board originally
licensing them may procxire a renewal
through American Consuls. The term of
the license is three years.
An important feature of the billâ that
particular feature, in fact, which explains
the wholeâ is the consideration which it
offers to these officers when serving the
United States in time of war. In that
event "every such master, mate, pilot or
engineer shall be entitled to the highest
rate of wages paid in the merchant marine
of the United States for similar service ;
and if killed or wounded while performing
such duties under the United States they
or their heirs or Jegal representatives
shall be entitled to all the privileges ac
corded to soldiers and sailors serving in
the army and navy under the pension laws
of the United States."
The dignity of the American merchant
marine is thus raised, but more important
than that is the fact that those charged
with the grave responsibilities attaching
to the service shall be loyal American cit
izens, ready when called upon to defend
the interests of their Government. The
loose way in which this matter has been
treated in the past has constituted an
ominous danger in case of war. The war
scares to which we have been treated
lately seem to be having a beneficial effeot
in many ways. They have made us aware
of the defenselcssness of our coast and the
inadequacy of our navy. The Frye bill is
one of the most useful measures that has
been proposed, and Congress should push
it through as rapidly as possible.
Another contribution to the pamphlet
literature of the silver question has been
issued under the title "That Demon Gold
Which Is Destroying the United States."
The work, which is by J. H. Tingman, is a
San Francisco publication, and takes the
form of a catechism, the various argu
ments being arranged as questions and
answers. It contains a great deal of infor
mation in a brief space and can be read
with profit by all interested in the subject.
That which most painfully disturbs New
England at this juncture is a report that
Senator Wetmore of Rhode Island has
shocked Washington by wearing a silk hat
with a sack coat. As the Senator lives in
Newport there are some who denounce the
report as blasphemous and others who
sadly admit its truth and call on the
Senator to render to his constituents the
apology of a resignation.
Colonel Cookerill recently wrote to the
New York Herald that he had authentic
information of a giant in China ten and a
half feet high and, while the Herald pub
lished the Btory without comment, the
later telegrams of the colonel show he was
for some reason ordered by the Herald to
leave China and go to Egypt.
There is a promise in everything in
these daysâ even Congress shows signs of
blossoming into an early adjournment.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Of the thousands of tall and short men who
â¢re to be seen at the various hotels of Ran
Francisco trom different parts of the country
at the preset t time the tallest is J. K. Choate
of Denver, known as the human lightning
rod.
Mr. Choate is so attenuated that be looks
even taller than he is. He suggests altitude
wherever he goes, and countless men at the
Brown Palace in Denver, where he frequently
is to be seen, and at the Palace Hotel, where
J. K. Choate of Denver, the Human
Lightning-Rod.
[Sketched from life by a " Call " artist.]
he is now staying, feeling themselves dwarfed,
"chirk" themselves up and elongate their
necks, so as to, if possible, eet somewhere in
the neighborhood of the long gentleman.- Do
what they will, however, and though Mr.
Cnoaie is amiable of disposition, it is odds
that they don't get to feeling quite natural.
Mr. Choate is a business man who has large
enterprises on hand. He is president of the
Denver Cotton-mill 3 Company, and came to
California witli Henry Wolcott, the million
aire manager of the great Argo Smelting
Works, and C. R. Condit, another wealthy gen
tleman of tb# Queen City of the Plains. Mr.
Choate has deep reddish or dark auburn hair
and a thick reddish mustache. He towers to
the height of 6 feet 4 1 j inches and is referred
to as the king of Denver tall men. Even the
"tall sycamore of the Wabash". would seem to
have a poor show alongside of him, for Mr.
Choate has no superfluous flesh to handicap
him in his aerial flight, and this gives him the
advantage as compared with many who by the
measuring line might overtop him.
"If you think I am tall, though,' said Mr.
Choate, "you ought to have seen Dr. Bancroft,
one of the early pioneers of Denver. For a
long time this gentleman,. whose white whisk
ers gave him a venerable appearance, was
known as the tallest man of the Rocky Moun
tain region. His measure has been given at
more than two inches over me. Everybody
has heard of Dr. Bancroft. He made a lot of
money, aud has been known far and wide."
To hear Mr. Choate tell of how other men
have overtopped him one is constrained to try
and think he isn't talking to a tall man at all,
but when he leaves him and feels the queer
sensation in his neck as the result of this up
ward gaze, he cannot get it out of his mind
that the suave Coloradan is indeed a human
lightning-rod.

A YOUNG GIRL'S NIGHTDRESS.
A nightdress for little girls, which is cut on
very simple lines, and yet is up to date, recom
mends itself to all mothers, for It is easily made
and will please the little miss by its pic
turesqueness, which Is the result of the large
collar and full 6leeves. The gown may be reÂ»
enforced in yoke shape for extra strength at
the top, where the wear and tear comes.
The collar may be neatly edged with a narrow
band of Hamburg embroidery, or a frill of
narrow lace, but is in itself very effective when
made of plain white collar cloth, batiste or
lawn. The neatest trimming and the tent ex
pensive is a tiny insertion of valenciehnei. let
in, about its width from the edge of the collar,
with an inch wide edge of lace to match
slightly gathered. This entails a little more
labor, but .repays one by ita daintiness. The
sleeves may be finished by a little ruffle with
lace and insertion to mates.
The gown without the collar is very pretty,
the full sleeves relieving its plainness.

A FISH-EATING DOG.
Dogs as a rule will not eat fish, either raw or
cooked, even though they are on the verge of
starvation, but on the McNear ranch in Marin
County there is one that will, and the has also
taught all of her puppies to do the same. Her
owner says she is the best mother-dog he ever
had on the plase.
Topsey is the name of the dog. She is a
Spitz, and is nearly 5 yeara old. Topsey ac
quired the habit of eating fish when she was
very young, and obtained them from a Chinese
Camp not far from the Tftnchhouse.
. When her first puppies had grown old enough
to eat she insisted that tney should have fish.
Topsey, With a Meal for Her Puppies.
[From a sketch.]
She would go down to the camp and carry
home the largest fish she could find, and tried
in every way to Jet them know that it was
good food. The puppies did not like it very
weilat llrst, but soon acquired the taste. If
other food was placed before the yountr ones
she would take it away. Strange as it may
seem, they never touched it during her ab
sence.
Topsey, however, wasted all her efforts, for
when her children grew up and were allowed
to run around by themselves they always pre
ferred meat to fish. Occasionally she will
make an effort to show them the error of their
ways and will bring up a specimen of the finny
tribe and lay it before them. When they re
fuse to eat it she shows unmistakable signs of
being offended.
Eating fish is not Topsey's only peculiarity.
She is an unusually smart dog, and whatever
she does she does in her own way. When she
drinks water, instead of lapping it up she puts
her nose into it and sucks it like a horse. She
will not sleep in the same part of the stable as
the other dogs, but has a particular corner of
her own, ana when she lies down always man
ages to cover herself with the rugs instead of
stretching out on top of them. She very sel
dom barks, but is always good-natured, al
though never showing a disposition to romp.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Successful women conductors are beginning
to come to the front very much in Europe.
One of the most practical and gifted of the
ladies who wield the baton seems to be Mrs.
Sophie Keller, the first female conductor in
Denmark. She is a daughter of the composer
and former singing-master at the Royal Opera
in Copenhagen, Henrik Rung. He was her
teacher, and when she was 19 years old she
made her appearance on the operatic stage as
Agatha in "Der Freischutz, " and for twenty
five years continued a brilliant lyric career.
In 1895 Mrs. Sophie Keller retired from the
stage and began to teach. Very soon she
found it would be a help to her pupils to have
a small theater connected with her school, and
by this means ncr interest in conducting wa3
aeveloped. Last autumn Mrs. Keller founded
an institution known as the Woman's Private
Society for Coucerts, which opened with about
a thousand active and associate members.
The undertaking has proved a brilliant suc
cess. Mrs. Keller is now gathering a complete
female orchestra, and she is beginning to pay
her "orchestra girls" in such a way that they
are able to get their livelihood by their instru
ments. The music given at the women's con
certs is of a high character, and Mrs. Keller

Condnctor in Denmark.

maintains excellent discipline, as well as
being able to excite the interest and ambition
of her musicians. The new departure has ex
cited great interest both in Denmark and
abroad.
The numerous changes which are being
made in the suburbs of Vienna have just
brought to light an interesting souvenir of
Franz Schubert. In reconstructing an old
house in the suburb of Waehring the workmen
discovered an inscription which recalls one of
the composer's most charming melodies. The
inscription is conceived in the following
terms: "Franz Schubert composed in this
house, then named the Beer Sack (Bier Sack) ,
in June, 1826, on a Sunday afternoon, sur
rounded by some friends, and in the midst of
the clatter of the inn, his song, 'Ham I the
Lark.' It was the celebrated aubado on Shake*
â peare's words, which has remained as fresh
&s his serenade, and which has been sung so
much that it has become almost banal. In the
suburbs of Vienna almost all the inns are- pro
vided with gardens (Gast^ausgarten), where
the habitues sit in fine: weataer, and it was in
the garden of an inn, opened in 1791 by a host
named Biersack, that Schubert composed his
aubade. The inn and the garden still exist,
even to the spreading chestnut tree beneath
which Schubert wrote his melody. The pres
ent proprietor of the place has changed the
name, however, since the discovery of the
tablet, and the inn is now known as Schu
bert's Garden.
The celebrated tenor Tamagno has just been
the object of a most unprecedented exhibition
of interest on the part of the Czar. Tamaguo
was singing at the Aquarium in St. Peters
burg, and at the end of his engagement the
Czar desired him to give one performance of
"Othello" at the Imperial Opera. The tenor,
however, was under contract to proceed Imme
diately to Monaco for the opening of the opera
season. The Czar wrote a personal letter to
the Princess of Monaco, begging her to grant
Tamagno a delay, a request which was imme
diately granted. The aristocracy of the
Russian capital all felt it incumbent on them
selves to attend the special performance of
"Othello," and the price of seats assumed
enormous proportions. A simple seat in the
orchestra cost $60 (three hundred francs), and
boxes were as much as $400 and $600. The
performance was a grand success. Tamagno
setout for Monaco the next morning, and the
Czar, not wishing to repay him for his delay
with money, sent his daughter a present of a
magnificent set of jewels.
Reginald de Koven is complaining bitterly
that very few of the nrtists in the Damrosch
German Opera Company can sing. He says
Max Alvary depends entirely on his per
sonality for his success, and that as an
exhibition of absolute vocal incapacity
nis singing is unequaled. Speaking- of
tho "surpassing badness" of Alvary's "Tanu
hauser," De Koven says: "In Western wilds
and frontier towns ' men have died for
less ; his performance was simply impermissi
ble." Frau Klafsky comes in for her share of
blame. De Koven owns that sho has a "gor
geous" voice, but he says she cannot produce
it, and reviewing the company in general he
says: "I often think regretfully, when hearing
German opera by German singers, how many
good voices there are that are marred, ruined
and let go to waste for lack of a little intelli
gent vocal training."
A wonderful child of 10 years old is astonish
ing the Parisian public. She is named Jeanne
Blancard and she gives recitals at which ahe
appears as pianist, composer and improvlsa
trice. A programme was recently performed at
the Borodine, entirely composed of her works.
They were fifteen numbers, nine for piano, all
of which she played herself, two for violin,
two for violoncello, .and two songs. The critics
were astonished at the ripe and artistic play
ing of the child, and say that if as a composer
her works are not marked by much breadth,
her imagination and knowledge of musical
form are extraordinary. It may be that little
Jeanne Blancard is the long-looked-for female
composer, who is to wipe away the reproach
that no woman has ever stood on the same
plane with men as a writer of music. Many
charming compositions are due to women, but
hitherto they hawe written no great works.
In France the cost of paying a claque to lead
the applause is a regular part of the running
expenses of a theater. There has been some
talk of abolishing the claque in theaters subsi
dized by the Government, but the Administra
tion of Fine Arts has just declared that the
claque at the Opera Comique shall be in charge
of an official engaged especially to hire and
superintend it This agent will have a certain
number o! places assigned to him for his
"clappers," and the men he hires will be ad
mitted on identification, in order that they
may not sell their seats to others, the agent
is also formally pledged not to receive the
smallest remuneration from any of the per
formers, as the Administration of Fine Arts
has decided that no artist shall win an illu
sionary success by bribing the claque. It was
the protests raised by the composers, the sing
ers and the ballet dancers which decided the
Government not to abolish the claque.
The Gazretta Offlciale of the Kingdom of
Italy publishes a royal decree by virtue of
whifchthe rights of Rossini's "Barber of Se
ville" are protected for two more years. The
opera was first presented in 1816, and should,
according to the law, become public property
in 1896 ieighty years being the term of the
copyright), but as the Music Lyceum of Pesearo
exists to a large extent on the revenue which
the royalties of this work bring it, the authori
ties have judged it proper to prorogue the ex
piration of the copyright in its favor. It is
strange, however, that a sovereign decree can
nullify a general law. Even in the interests of
art, this seems scarcely right.
The chair left vacant by Atnbroise Thomas at
the Conservatoire should fall either to Mas
senet or Baint-Saens. Both of them are most
eccentric. Massenet figuratively hides him
self in a cupboard the night any opera of his is
produced. He is a splendid raconteur, and is
Â«ry popular in bohemian society of the firs t
order. Saint-Saens delights in surprising his
friends. He has been known to disappear
after some great triumph, ttnd give the papera
a chance of finding his dead body in a dozen
different places at the same time, to say noth
ing of the veiled hints that his mind has broken
down and that he is in a lunatic asylum.
A new opera, called "The Bard," has just
been produced very successfully at Nice. The
story, which is dramatic and interesting, is
supposed to paÂ«s in England in the ninth cen
tury, at the time of the Danish invasions, and
the stirring- epoch gives plenty of scope for
passion and pathos. The music, by Leon Gas
tinel, is of the modern French school. It is
full of color and gives great prominence to tho
orchestra. The "March of the Standard" is
said to t>e a magnificent number in the opera,
and a chorus of laborers was encored again
and again.
Thq sixtieth anniversary of the first repre
sentation of "Les Huguenots" in Paris has just

that Meyerbeer's chef d'oeuvre was played for

role of Valentina in an admirable fashion, is
still living in retirement in Paris.

time wnen you are beating six-eight?" The
lady shut up her fan and the recital was con

Woolen-Mills â A. X., Tracy, Cal. Tnera
were two woolen-mills in operation at the Mis
sion in this City at one time. One was the
Mission Woolen-mills at the northeast corner
of Folsoru and Sixteenth streets, which was
put in operation by Lazard & McLennan in
1861. The other was the Pacific Woolen and
Knitting Mills on the west side of Folsom
street, between Eighteenth and Nineteenth,
which was completed in 1866, but the machin
ery was not put in operation until June, 1867.
These mills were originated by James Roberts,
for many years superintendent of the Mission
Woolen-mills, and Lazard Freres were the
agents. In 1869 the Mission and the Pacific
mills were consolidated ana continued so
until 1882, when they went out of existence
because the people preferred to patronize East
em manufacture and did not think enough of
home manufacture to help it along.

HOW THE CASE WAS WON
Interest Increasing in the De
la Montanya De*
cision.
INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE.
Learned Opinion by Justice Temple
Reversing the Judgment of the
Lower Court.
The interest awakened by the Supreme
Court decision in the De la Montanya case,
published in The Call yesterday, was by
no means confined to law circles. The
parties to the suit are known throughout
California- at least their troubles have
made them so. But it may be said for the
court decision that it establishes a prece
dent, and will stand for all time as such in
the law books. ... The opinion written by
Justice Temple is a learned and able one,
and is concurred in by Justices Garoutte,
GRANDFATHER DE LA MONTANYA, HIS SON AND GRANDCHILDREN.
Hensnaw and Harrison, and lawyers hold
that it is in accordance with the reasoning
of United States decisions and the best
text writers.
The story, of which this is somewhat of
a climax, begins several years ago, when
James de la Montanya was married to
Lorraine, the daughter of ex-Judge Spen
cer of San Jose. The affair was one of
those notable events that create a stir in
society through the entire season.
Before those things happened that caused
the husband and wife to separate two
children had been born. The separation
took place in 1893, immediately after the
husband returned from a trip to Europe.
He took the children and returned to
Paris and became domiciled as a French
â¢izen under the French law.
'he wife brought the suit for divorce
1 the custody of the children. The
ira was set up with regard to the
children that the husbard had left the
State to escape the jurisdiction of the
California courts. She also brought a suit
separate from the divorce proceedings to
recover the custody of the children. She
engaged an array of counsel. Garber,
Boalt & Bishop, E. R. Taylor. Carroll
Cook and Francis E. Spencer of San Jose,
the latter being her father.
Service was had by publication. The
case was heard and judgment was ren
dered by default.
Messrs. Dorn & Dorn then appeared for
the defendant and, not combating the
divorce, moved that the judgment be set
aside in the suit for the custody of the
children and for permanent maintenance
and also that portion of the judgment in
the divorce case awarding the custody of
the children and alimony. The reason
offered was that the defendant being
absent from the State the court had no
jurisdiction to award alimony on the
custody of the children, especially as the
children were also out of the State.
Then Degan a bitter lepal battle â one of
the strongest contests that the courts of the
State have witnessed for many years. The
briefs and records as they lie piled up in
the office of the County Clerk to-day num
ber more than 1000 pages. The points at
issue trenched upon new grounds. They
had never been raised in this State before.
No case in the history of the jurisprudence
of the United States, indeed, stands upon
all fours with it. The husband in the case
was a citizen of France and the children
were with him in his custody. FightiDg
I for the mother and the recovery of the
children, maintenance and alimony, were,
as stated, Garber. Boalt <fc Bishop. E. Tay
lor, that tecbnicologistJCarroll Cook, and
I ex-Judge Spencer.
Against these forces Dorn & Dorn single
handed carried on the fight for the father.
Judge Slack In the Superior Court gave the
allied forces the victory. Dorn <fe Dorn went
to the Supreme Court. There John Garber
I led the opposition and himself made the
I principal argument.
But the Supreme Court sustained the
| position of the counsel for the husband in
every particular and entered its judgment
accordingly â that the order of rhe Jower
court be "reversed and the trial cause re
manded with directions to the lower court
to grant appellant's motion to vacate the
! portions ol the decree objected to."
The point of the decision is. in a word,
that when a citizen of this State passes
beyond the jurisdiction of the courts of
this State by taking up domicile in an
other, while the court retains jurisdiction
in rein upon any property which he may
have in court, over his person or of such
children as he may have with him the
court has no jurisdiction to make any
award as to their custody, nor for ali
mony, maintenance or counsel fees.
The decision, from which there is no
appeal, is one of international importance.
James de la Mtmtanya is ;i descendant
of an ancient Huguenot family. Johannes
de la Montanya received the title of count
from the French court in 1619. James de
la Montanya Jr., having become domiciled
iw France as a French citizen, succeeds to
the title, and is now doubtless wearing the
family crest â c tieur de lis supported by
two eagles witn expanded wings.
The two children, the object of the great
controversy, are attending jchool in Paris, j
CRUSHED TO DEATH.

Pupils of the Irving Institute Have an
Exciting Experience on Hyde
Street.
An accident which, very fortunately,
was attended with nothing more serious
tbnn a little jarring occurred yesterday
afternoon near the corner of Hyde and
Sutler streets.
Tue carryall used to convey the pupils
of the Irving Institute to and from their
homes was making its last distribution of
children after school hours.
There were five little eirls and their
teacher. Miss Letty McDonald, in tne
vehicle when the front axle broke and
tumbled the precious, screamine freight

street and lost his grip on the reins. The
horses were grabbed by a gentleman who

Miss McDonald and her little pupils

but afoot.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
A New Board of Port Wardens
Will Take Office Next
Tuesday.
The Bark Alexandra Towed Off the
Mission Mud Flats by the
Fearless.
On Tuesday next San Francisco will
have a new set of Port Wardens. Captain
J. W. Gage, A. J. Martin and D. J. Wat
son will gracefully retire, and Major Har
ney, superintendent of the Sacramento
Transportation Company, Captain At
wood, grain surveyor lor McNear, and
Captain Provost will take their place. The
retiring members retire without a protest,
but the chances are that the new men will
not be able to take their seats in peace and
quietness. The assertion is made that
Major Harney and Captain Atwood being
engaged in the shipping business are in
eligible. It is also said that Harney wants
to move the office of the Wardens to Wash
ington-street wharf, but this is denied.
The chances are, however, that when the
matter comes to a test both Harney
I and Atwood will have to give up their
present position or retire from the office
of Port Warden.
The big four-masted schooner Golden
Shore has made a record-breaking run
from here to Melbourne, Australia. The
voyage started out badly, as the vessel had
to "put in here in distress. After leaving
Puget Sound the schooner was caught in a
gale., and the mate and two of the crew
were swept overboard. Being shorthanded.
Captain Henderson put in here ana secured
new men. From Here the Golden Shore
made the run in fifty-four days, and Cap
tain Smith, the managing owner, says it
comes near to the record. The Golden
Shore is one of the prettiest four-masted
schooners afloat.
The little launch Pup, that was sunk by
the steamer San Bias, was rai-ed yester
day and put on a scow. The Millen
Griffith then towed both to Oakland Creek,
where the necessary repairs to the launch
will be made. Captain "Bill" Taylor says
the Pup will be ready for the next Pacific
j Mail steamer that comes along.
The Alaska PacKers' Association and
Kruse & Euler have amalgamated. The
latter own the Prosper salting station on
Bristol Bay, and the former are very large
packers of codfish. Their interests were
identical, but for over a year the two con
cerns have been fighting each other. All
this is now done away with, however, and
Kruse & Euler have been absorbed by the
Alaska Packers' Association. The move is
a good one for all the interested parti-s.
The bark Alexandra was towed off t!ie
mud flats by the Fearless and Vigilant
yesterday, and is now at anchor in the i
stream. From the shore she appears to be j
as good as the da}' she was launched, but |
her decks and shrouds tell a different story
on closer inspection. As soon as the ques
tion of insurance and salvage is settled the
cargo will be discharged and the vessel
docked for repairs. Captain Bartield's leg
is still in a very bad way, and it may be

PAINTERS ARE AT WORK
Union Journeymen Again Take
Up Their Brushes in
Friendly Shops.
MANY STRIKERS STILL IDLE.
The Master Painters Claim That the
Backbone of the Strike
Is Broken.
Many union winters yesterday returned
to work for the bosses favorable to the
union.
There are a large number of idle strikers
who will not be able to secure employment
for a while.
The union offers a written guarantee to
all boss painters who fear trickery on the
part of those who return to work that no
strike will be ordered on their shops while
the union's demands are observed.
The officers of the Master Painters' As
sociation claim that the backbone of the
strike is broken and say that they will pay
no attention to the union.
Salvation Army officers deny the report
made by several union painters that Sal
vation soldiers are taking the places of the
striking painters.
THE STRIKE SITUATION.
Union Painters Confident They
Will Yet Defeat the Un
friendly Bosses.
The members of the Painters' Union are
well pleased with their action of Tuesday
in permitting the men to go back to the
bosses who are friendly to the union.
They are more than ever confident of win
ning the strike now waged against the
estimated at the headquarters that be
tween 100 and 175 journeymen found em
ployment, with those who have acceded to
avowed enemies of the union. It is roughly
the union's demands. This will relieve
the pressure considerably, and quiets
the restlessness of the impatient. Be
sides it provides a fund for those who
on account of their enforced idleness may
come to want. This fund will no doubt be
greatly increased immediately after the
benefit to be given next Wednesday even
ing in the Bush-street Theater. W.
Danielson of the entertainment committee
reports that enough first-class nrofessional
talent has volunteered to run three shows.
Every company in the City has volun
teered.
At Tuesday's meeting it was decided that
every man not working must register daily
at the headquarters. As might be expected,
there was a good-sized registration yester
day. Until the bosses are convinced by
the union's guarantee that the painters are
in earnest and not leading them into a
trap the registration will be large. Re
ports were made that since the strike has
been declared off with the friendly bosses
the latter have been out for contracts that
they have been nursing along until the
strike should be- settled. It is said that
j there will be plenty of work that has been |
accumulating to be done in the very near]
future.
The strike has brought to the front a
new element in the painting line. A num
ber of the journeymen have determined
to take work for themselves, and several
have already made good fat contracts. It
is estimated that between $10,000 and $13,
--000 worth of work has been secured. These
men will not appear on the held as rivals
to friendly bosses, but will pay full wages
and Did at the standard rates. Several j
journeymen yesterday turned their con
tracts over to friendly bosses and went to
work at regular day r s wages. It is a sort
of open secret that these contracts were
gathered in during the progress of the
strike to be fulfilled should it become nec
essary to enter into competition with all
tue master painters.
There has been a sharp stick cut for j
those union men who have violated the
rules of the union by going to '
work alter being called" out. They j
will be formally charged and tried". In the i
event of their conviction they will be fined
or expelltd from the union and put on
the blacklist.
The statement made by certain mem- I
| bers of the Master Painters' Association j
I that the demands of the union were un
; just, that the union was interfering with
I the masters' private business affairs and
that, to corupiy, would work a hardship
on property-owners, seems to rankle in I
the oreasts of the strike leaders, Several j
of the latter have advocated challenging I
the master painters to a public debate of
the questions. As a result the following
open letter has been addressed by R. T.
k Mclvor:
To the Master Painters' Association of the
Pacific Coastâ Gkntlkmen: I am informed that I
prominent members of your association have I
caused to be published ihe statement that the
demands of The Painters' Union in the present
controversy are unjust and to comply with the
same will be an interference with "your" busi- i
ness, and that it will cost The property-owners
more for work performed. Now I will submit I
for your consideration the following propot<i- I
tion: Our union will select three of its mem
bers who will meet three members of your
i association ir. a public debate. The subject-
I matter to be discussed will be the demands of
the Paiuters' Union, namely, $3 for eight
hours' work and our right to decline to work
with non-union men.
Should any member of your association de
cide to accept this suggestion we will meet the
gentlemen at any time and place convenient
to yourselves. Respectfully, R. T. Mclvok.
THE UNION'S GUARANTY.
No Mora Strikes Will Be Ordered
In the Friendly Bosses'
Shops.
One session of the Painters' Union was
held yesterday. At 10 o'clock the strikers
assembled at 115 Turk street to discuss the
situation and obtain further information
as to what the conditions are under which
they may or must not work, according
to the decision of the union last Tuesday.
Those who failed to grasp the situation
were again informed that they could re
turn to work for those bosses who conduct
union shops, pay $3 a day for eig.it hours'
work and hire only union men.
Many were of thr opinion that the time
of-peaee rule applies to those shops. That
is, that if a non-union man is found work
ing on a job a week's notice is neces
sary before the job can be strucK. Such is
not the case. These are striKe times, and
the presence of a non-union workman on
a job or in a shop is sufficient evidence
that the boss does not propose to comply j
with the union's demanus, and it there- |
fore behooves the union men to quit or bs I
lined or blacklisted by the union.
A number of men stated that some of!
the bosses desire some guarantee that if !
they take the union men back to work ]
their experience of a week ago will not be
repeated and the men again ordered out
on a strike.
It was decided that any friendly boss
whose confidence had been shaken will
receive a written guarantee under the seal
of the union that so lonÂ« as he keeps a
union shop he will be exempt from an
other waikout or strike so far as the
Painters' and Decorators' Union is con
cerned.
SALVATION PAINTERS.
Captain McFee Denies the Report
That They Are Working on
StrucK Jobs.
In yesterday's Call was published the
report of one of the union painters to the
, effect that Salvation Army soldiers had
taken the places of striking painters in
several instances. A letter was received
by the union from the Salvation Army of
ficials denying the truth of the story. If
anj' or the soldiers were or are at work it
was not with the knowledge or consent of
the organization. Captain McFee said :
"There is no truth in the story pub
lished to-day that the array is supplying
men to take the places left vacant by tne
strikers. The truth of the matter is that
the army is doing what it can to aid the
men in their struggle for their rights."
Notwithstanding the denial, there are a
number of striking painters who assert
that the Salvation soldiers are and have
been at work on "struck" jobs. They say
that they have seen the soldiers actually
at work painting. The union painters say
that they are unable to prove that any
contracts were entered into between the
Salvation Army officers and the contrac
tors. The soldiers may be at work on
their own account for all the union men
know.
There are several religious organizations
in this City whose members wear caps and
badges, and it is possible that the caps
and Tbadges seen on the workers in ques
tion were those of some other religious
body.
â¢COYOTE CONTRACTORS."
Jabez Swan Tel s Why He Indorses
the Strike and the Card
System.
Jabez Swan of Swan & Stein stated yes
terday that he hoped the Painters' Union
will win their light. He said:
From the first I have alwsys conducted a
union shop. When I was asked to give the
house-painters eight hours a day I did so, find
voluntarily reduced the time of the sign
painters to eight hours also. I do not belong
to the Master Painters' Association. In that
body there are some of the best and most hon
orable men in the City, but there are also men
whom we speak of as "coyote" contractors.
We can't do business with these fellows in the
field. To show what a coyote contactor is let
me illustrate : I will bid for a contract for say
$800. I calculate upon the cost of material,
wages of the.men and the time. Ido not get
the job and find that some one else has secured
the contract for $400. I watch the work and
find that ray successful rival will mnke some
thing on the job. How? He employs a gang
of boys and poor workmen who work for very
small wages, and he uses "dope" or the
poorest of materials. I will not belong to an
organization that has such men on its mem
bership roll.
Right in such a case is where the unions'
working-card system will be of advantage to
the honest master painter. The unions should
protect us against such "coyote" contractors
by carpenters, plumbers, lathers and other
union, men refusing to work on a job where
any one is "covotine." This is why I favor
labor unions, and especially the card system.
If the card system is honestly carried out by
the union journeymen it will be as great pro
tection to us as to the men themselves. This
is why I for one hope the strikers will win.
My men are all at work to-dsy, although I
urged them not to come back until the strike
was settled, or at least until it was all right for
them to do so.
MASTER PAINTERS' VIEWS.
The Members Say the Backbone of
the Strike Has Been Broken
by Union Men.
President Black of the Master Painters'
Association expressed himself as being
well pleased with the action of the Paint
ers' Union on Tuesday. He said:
I don't like this strike business and the
sooner it is over the better. Th<; backbone of
the strike is broKen. I can't sec it in any other
lipht. When the men became so restless
tha', the leaders could not hold them together
any longer there was only one thing to do and
that was to let the men go back to work. That
is not a backdown on the part of the union.
Those who are not at work might as well be on
astrkeasnot. There is only a little business
in the painting trade at present and I do not
believe that over 75 or at the outside 150 of
those who are willing to return will be able to
secuie work. Even before the decision of the
union men on Tuesday the master painters of
this City had all or about all the men they
couid use.
Mr. Upbam, also a prominent member
of the association, concurred with the
president. He said he has all the time he
wants to do his work, and added that
while he could pnt tifty men to work he
had decided not to do so. He proposes, he
said, to striae the work along and let his
present force finish the jobs one after an- ,
other as they are able.
RATIFIED THE CARD.
Carpenters' Union 22 Will Stand
by Other Building Trades After
April 1.
A special meeting of Carpenters' Union
No. 22 was held in Odd Fellows' Hall last
night for the purpose of taking action on
the working card, as requested by the
Building Trades Council.
The largest fraternal mreting hall in the
building was occupied and scarcely a seat
was vacant. A representative proportion
of the large union was present. It was
estimated that of the 782 members fully
500 participated in the proceedings.
The vote was decisive, for it was unani
mous in support of the card.
Aftpr adjournment P. H. McCarthy,
president of the union, said: "We have
voted to put the Building Trades Council
card into effect April 1."
"What will be the possible effect?"
"The effect will be just as it has been
with this. union. The card has been in
] operation with us for months, and our
members would not work on a contract
with a non-union carpenten Now, how
ever, we have simply ratified the card with
the building trades, and on and after April
I members of Carpenters' Union 22 will
refuse to work with a non-union workman
on any building. This means that if there
should be a non-union plasterer, or, in
fact, any other non-union man in the
building trades, on a job we will not work
with him."
DR. DUDLEY INSTALLED.
The New Resident Physician Unuanally
Well equipped.
Dr. F. W. Dudley has been duly in- %
stalled as resident physician and assistant
superintendent at the City and County
Hospital, and is already winning golden
opinions from his confreres.
The latest appointee of the Board of
Health is a capable young man of affable
manners, who is already winning the good
will of all with whom he comes in con
tact.
He is unusually well equipped, having
studied in a practical way with Dr. W. S.
Beede of Stockton for Hve years, during
which he was a druggist nt that city. He
graduated from the medical department
of the University of California last July,
and soon afterward was appointed sur
geon of the Belgic. He was on that vessel
m its recent perilous adventure off Yoko
hama. On his return the Board of Health
appointed him resident physician at the
City and County Hospital.
DUSE IS EXPECTED.
The Italian Actress Has Been Engaged
for the Columbia.
Messrs. Friedlander, Gottiob & Co. state
that they nave engaged the great Italian
actress, Elenora Duse, and her entire
company for the Columbia Theater during
the last week in May and the first week in
June.
l>use will appear in the extended
repertory in which she has been Dlay
ing in New York, "La Dame aux
Camellias," "Cavalleria Rusticana,"
"Mapda," "La Soconderia," etc. Her
uomingis expected to be the great theatri
cal event of the season, as admirers of the
modern and the natural in acting pro
claim almost without exception that Duse
is the greatest actress before the public
to-day.
The Unkindest Cut of All,
As Shakespeare says, is to poke fun or sneer at
Deople who are nervous, under the half-belief that
â¢ heir complaint is imaginary or an affectation. It
is neither, but a serious reality. Imperfect diges
tion and assimilation of the food is a very com
mon cause of nervousness, especially thatdlstress
ing form of it which manifests itself in want of
sleep. Hostetter's Stomach Bitters speedily rem
edies nervousness, as it also does malarial, kidney,
bilious and rheumatic ailments. The weak gain
vigor speedily through Its use.

INTERRUPT NAVIGATION.
Testimony Taken in the Mat
ter of the Oaklani
Bridges.
Mayor Davie and Others State the
Caseâ Will Be Submitted to the
Secretary of War.
There was a meeting in the office of
Colonel Suter, "United States Engineers,
yesterday morning, to hear the evidence
in the case of the Webster and Alice street
bridaes in Oakland, against which com
plaints have been filed as to their inter
fering with navigation. The bridges ex
tend from Oakland to Alameda over the
canal or inlet, through which there is a
great deal of traffic. The bridges have
been complained o; as being obstructions
to navigation ; that the draw opening is
too narrow and that the draws are not
operated properly in the interest of navi
gation.
Quite a large gathering of interested
people was present, among the people
there being Assistant General Manager
Curtis of the Southern Pacific, Mayor
Davie of Oakland, Prosecuting Attorney
Snook of Oakland, members of the Board
of Supervisors of Alameda, as well as a
number of private citizens, merchants and
ship-owners.
In the absence of Colonel Suter Lieu
tenant Kuhn conducted the proceedings.
District Attorney Snook, Mayor Davie,
Captain Mqnneis, Captain McNeil], Cap
tain Meyns, tueboat men, and Air. Gins
cock of Oakland made statements in line
with the protest.
Mr. Curtis, for the Southern Pacific Com
pany, announced that the company pro
posed to replace with new bridges those
that are complained of. He denied, how
ever, that the draw opening was too small
for the purpose.
An adjournment was taken until next
Tuesday at 11 o'clock, when further testi
mony will be taken.
The whole matter, when completed, will !
be laid before the Secretary of War for his
decision aa to tbe necessities of the case.

SEEKING A NEW
SIDE-DOOR LAW
One of the Aims of the
California Protective
Association.
REASONS FOR THE STAND
Desires a Distinction Made Be
tween Moral and Immoral
Places.
A CONFERENCE TO BE HELD.
The Police Commissioners Will Be
Asked to Recommend a New
Ordinance.
One of the earliest tasks of the California
State Protective Association will be to
eecure the passage of a new ordinance re
lating to side-door saloons.
This action, among others, was deter
mined upon at the last meeting of the
association. The present law has never
been thoroughly put to the test of
its validity, but it is the opinion of
some of the members of the association
that if it were it would be declared invalid.
The association in its proposed action dis
avows any intention of obstructing the
movement to have the known side
entrance pitfalls abolished, but is. de
sirous of having a discrimination made
between the resorts for immoral women
and those saloons which provide a side
entrance for the convenience of gentlemen
who desire to hold a private interview and
at the same time indulge in a social cock
tail or an innocuous gin-o-lin.
With this purpose in view a conference
will be held some time next week between
the trustees of the association and the
Board of Police Commissioners. To the
latter will be submitted the whole matter,
and they will be asked to recommend to
the Supervisors the desired measures.
The conference had been set for last Tues
day, but the death of the father of Com
missioner Gunst caused it to be postponed.
George W. Baker, the attorney for the
association, speaking of the matter yester
day, said:
"When the association was organized in
1894 the side-door ordinance had already
been enacted, and something like 150
arrests had been made for violations of it.
This association is not organized for the
purpose of opposing reasonable ordinances
nor to counsel members to violate any
ordinance, whether legal or illegal, until
the same has been taken up by the asso
ciation and testea in the courts. Any
ordinance, however, which the board of
directors of the .association believes un
reasonable will be taken up ana tested in
the courts, before municipal bodies, or the
Legislature, but in every case it will insist
on its members being law-abiding and
not undertaking to set at deiiance the con
stituted authorities.
"We have never paid any attention to
this side-door ordinance because we were
rot called upon by any of our members to
investigate it, as the arrests were made
before our organization wan effected.
"If it should happen that any consider
able number of our members were ar
rested under the provisions of this law for
the maintenance of side doors it would
become the duty of this association and
myself, as its attorney, to take up the con
sideration of the ordinance so far as its
legal status is concerned. If upon that
investigation I found the ordinance was
unreasonable it would then be the duty of
the association to test its validity, carry
ing it to the highest court ii necessary,
and without expense to the particular
members prosecuted.
"Ii on the other hand it should be deter
mined that the ordinance was legal we
would advise our members to conform
to it."
"What do you mean when you speak of
the ordinance being legal?" was asked.
"By speaking of the ordinance as being
legal'l mean that the right to pass itis one
that properly and legally falls within the
pohce powers of the Supervisors, and that
they have not transcended their powers by
its enactment.
â¢'I he present status of this ordinance i 3
peculiar and uncertain. One of the cases
lor a violation of it was placed in the hands
of Cross, Hall, Ford <fc Keily, a law firm of
standing in this City. It was the opinion
of Mr. Cross, who had charge of the case,
that the ordinance was invalid and that it
could be successfully resisted. The case
was tried in the first place in one of the
Eolice courts â I believe in that of Judge
owâ and the defendant was convicted.
The case was appealed to the Superior
Court, and upon the motion for the allow
ance of the appeal Mr. Hall argued the case
very elaborately before Judge Bahrs, with
the result that a new trial was ordered in
the Superior Court.
"That was considered at the time by all
of the sidedoor people as a victory in their
favor and as virtually declaring the ordi
nance in question invalid. This decision
brought down on Judge Bphrs the censure
of the reformers and the press as main
taining the validity of the side doors
against what the Civic Federation and
others considered a valid exercise of the
police powers. After the appeal was al
lowed the case was continued for several
months, and was finally sent to Judge
Wallace's court from Judge Bahrs' depart
ment. But when the case came up for
trial and Judge Wallace learned that it
had been transferred to his court from
Judge Bahrs' department he declined to
try it, and immediately returned it to his
diffident colleague, as lie did not consider
that it had come legitimately before him.
"When the case came up before Judge
Bahrs the defendant, rather than go t& the
expense of employing counsel, pleaded
guilty and was fined $20 without being
tried.
"So it leaves the question of the validity
of the side-door ordinance still an open
one in all the courts. Most of the other
defendants have pleaded puiltv in the
Police Court and paid fines of $10, and the
remaining defendants will probably do the
same thing.
"In cases where it is known that side
doors are maintained for immoral pur
poses â that is, where young girls can be
taken and plied with drinks till made
helpless â this association will not only
not defend the person arrested, but would
assist the authorities in the prosecution of
the offender.
"The trouble with the present ordinance
is that it does not distinguish between
what I would call the legitimate side-door
saloon, where one can go with a friend for
a social time or with a gentleman to nold
a private business inteiview, and those
places which are dangerous pitfalls for
young and innocent girls. Ali are placed
under the same ban by tnis ordinance, and
it is this objection that we wouid like to
see remedied."
SEEING INDIAN SCHOOLS.
L'uitcil States Supervisor Heinemunn
on the Progress of the Ked Children.
A. Heinemann of Washington, D. C,
United States Supervisor of Indian Edu
cation, is at the Russ, having arrived from
Oregon-. Washington and others of the
Isorthwebtern States, where he has been
looking into the education of the Indians.
He v:sited the different reservations,
spending considerable time at ail of them.
The Indians everywhere, he says, are
getting along surprisingly well. He says
the children in some ways are brighter
even than white children. They show su
periority, especially with the use of tools
and in the execution of all kinds of me
chanical work. He thinks the genius of the
red man is shown even in the superiority
of the mud pies which he makes in child
hood.
The best Indian school of all that he
visited was the non-reservation school near
Salem. There the Indian boys and girls
were progressing with great rapidity.
However, throughout the country, the
Indian schools are prospering and Mr.
Heinemann expects that in a few years
many Indians will be numbered among
the most useful citizens of the country.
Mr. Heinemann will visit the Napa and
Round \ r alley Indians and note their
progress in education in a few days.
EFFORTS APPRECIATED.
Thanks Returned to the Traffic Aasocia
tion by the Humboldt Chamber
of Commerce.
That the efforts of the Traffic Association
in securing terminal rates for Eureka, on
shingles to points on the Missouri and
East are appreciated is shown by the re
ceipt of the lollowing letter by that body
from the Humboldt Chamber of Com
merce :
At a regular meeting of the Humboldt Cham
ber of Commerce, held March 16, 1896, it was
unanimously ordered "that an official letter of
congratulation over the result of their obtain
ing terminal rates on shingles from Eureka
East be sent to the California Traffic Associa
tion, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
and Board of Trade; also thanking them for
the good work in our behalf."
In accordance with this direction we hereby
congratulate you oh the results already ob
tained, in the "reduction of freight rates to cer
tain Eastern points on shingles, and thank
you for your share in obtaining tor us this con
cession. We venture to hope that you will not
relax your efforts in our behalf until all our
lumber products are included in the conces
sion as well as shingles, and at rates definite
and fixed. In other words, that you will con
tinue to assist us Until we secure terminal
rates on all of our shipments to all Eastern
points via San Francisco, something for which
we have been striving for a number of years,
but until now with little encouragement or
hope of r uccess.
THE CIVIC FEDERATION
Discrimination in the Assessed
Valuation of Railroad
Property Shown.
Church Property and City Railroad
Taxes Compared by the Ex
pert's Report.
The Civic Federation, though apparently
not making much noise, is actively en
gaged in trying to correct some of the
many abuses that have existed in the
management of public affairs of this City.
At a meeting held on Tuesday a lengthy
report was received from Colonel R. Lam
bert on the assessed valuation of real
estate by the City Assessor. Among other
things Colonel Lambert reported that the
only discriminations he found on the As
sessor's books were in favor of tbe Soutlrern
Pacific Company.
This was on the block upon which the
Southern Pacific buildings are located.
The railroad company owned ihirty-six
blocks of land, comprising eighty-nine
acres of streets, alleys and squares.
One block of this property was assessed
atslÃÃ,3Oo, while an adjoining block was
assessed at $186,000 and still a third block
for $188,620.
The railroad company's property, formed
what might be termed an impregnable
barrier to the water front and its valuation
might be considered worth $3,500,000, yet
its assessed valuation, as appears from the
Assessor's books, shows it to be worth
$682,532, and on this valuation taxes are
paid amounting to $15,356. Tbis Colonel
Lambert considers a political blur on the
official map of San Francisco.
The property-holding of the Spring Val
ley Water Company and the Hibernia
Bank were considered to be far too low
and wholly inadequate to the rent revenue
derived from the same.
The $2 25-tax levy of last year was char
acterized as being nothing short of a
'"rob," which should be taken notice of
by property-owners when called upon to
cast their ballot in favor of the proposed
new charter.
An alarming discrimination in the as
sessed valuation of the properties owned
by the Pacific Mail Company and the
Oceanic Steam Navigation Company was
pointed out Dy producing the following
iigures:
The Mail Company's property is
fully worth $10,000,000, upon which
$417 72 is paid yearly in taxes, while on
the Oceanic line, which does not do one
half the business, the tax paid is $11,883 38.
Huntington's network of street railroads
contributes tbe small sum of $25,780,wbi1e
the church properties pay $56,154, segre
gateathus: The Roman Catholic Church
owns thirty-five pieces upon which $1,301,
--334 is the fixed valuation, and the several
Protestant churches own eighty- four pieces
valued at $1,194,410.
The federation is of the opinion that the
office of the Tax Collector could be abol
ished and its work consolidated with that
of the Assessor's office.
A committee was appointed to invite
Professor David Starr Jordan to address
the federation at the next meeting upon
"Municipal Government."
NOW A MATTER OF HOURS.
Closing Day of the Notable Encyclo
partlic Dictionary Distribution.
Some time during the day the last name
will have been added to the list of those
who will receive one of the 500 introduc
tory sets of the New Encyclopaedic Dic
tionary, which the Pacific Coast Newspa
per Syndicate, has been distributing at an
introductory price, in order to place the
work in cultured homes and communities
for the favorable publicity to be secured b3 r
a comparison with other dictionaries and
encyclopedias.
It has only been necessary to send $1 to
the Syndicate headquarters, .% Montgom
ery street, and the full set of four volumes,
numbering over 5000 pages, was delivered
as fast as facilities would permit.
It is also provided in the announcement
of The Syndicate that the volumes may be
sent back and money will be refunded,
provided the work is not entirely as repre
sented.
And in order that every one, whether
living in or out of the City, -may have an
equal chance it has been decided to fill all
personal applications which may be regis
tered at Syndicate headquarters up to 10
o'clock to-night, and also to enter, as above
hinted, all orders by mail or telegraph
which are postmaiked or dated any time
before that hour.
To-night at 10 o'clock, therefore, will be
the last moment for any one, in City or
country, to secure a set of the work on'the
introductory terms, for hereafter the regu
lar subscription price of $42 per set will
prevail, and the volumes are good value
even at this apparently high figure.
Remember, then, that if to-day you
bring or Bend $1 to the Pacific Coast Newsp
aper Syndicate the entire set of four
superb volumes will be delivered to you,
and you have the use of them during the
year while paying for them at $1 25 per
month.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 1896.
MANUFACTURERS MEET
First Annual Session of Their
Prosperous Association Is
Held.
HORACE DAVIS IS PRESIDENT.
New Directors Are Elected and Dues
Raised to $io a Yearâ lnformal
Talk.
The first annual meeting of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association was
held yesterday afternoon in the rooms of
the Chamber of Commerce. There was a
large attendance, and among those present
were several representative members of
the manufacturing community. Henry
T. Scott, president of the association, oc
cupied the chair.
In calling the meeting to order Mr. Scott
said that after a year the association was
gathered together to review the work ac-
Horace Davis, Who Was Elected President of the Merchants' and Producers'
Association Yesterday.
complisbed, and to devise plans for the
future. The work of the members spoke
for itself. By virtue of the provisions of
the constitution he named the following
fifteen members as a nominating commit
tee to select directory for the year to come :
George E. Dow, C. R. Allen* C. E. War
den, N. A. Judd, George Gray, Li. G.
Schweitzer, R. Liddle, A. Haraszthy, W.
McNicoll, J. Strahl, A. E. Chodski, J. Bru
nell, J. E. Partridge, E. C. Williams and
K. Valentine.
M. M. Barnett wanted the rules re
scinded, and a second set of officers
named. "There is danger that if this is
not done," he paid, "some people may
think there has been something in the na
ture of a star chamber proceedine."
" The chair promptly reDlied that the re
mark was out of order, because any man
on the floor was privileged to make such
independent nominations.as he pleased.
Secretary L. K. Mead 'read his annual
report, which was published in The Call
last January when the report was issued.
A letter was read from the Chamber of
Commerce inviting members of the asso
ciation to attend a special meeting of the
chamber Thursday, March 26, at 2:30 p. m.,
to consider the question of ''international
arbitration."
A. Sbarboro, treasurer of the associa
tion, reported that the receipts for the
year were $8249 12; disbursements,
$8009 45; balance on hand, $239 67.
A vote of thanks was tendered the board
of directors and the secretary and treas
urer.
Julian Sonntag said that he had come to
the conclusion during the past year that
the dues of $6 were not enough to assure
the association's welfare. He believed
that the dues should be $10 a year, for that
income would place sufficient money in
the treasury to insure an efficient working
orce.
f Barnett amended to make the dues $1 a
month, but this was defeated and Sonn
tag's motion carried almost unanimously.
Barnett moved that after the nominat
ing committee made its report the polls be
kept open two hours to give all members a
chance to vote. The motion was carried.
The committee presented the following
names: Horace Davis, H. J. Crocker, J. W.
Kerr, A. Dernham, W. F. Bowers, J. P.
Currier, A. Sbafboro, M. J. Keller, M. Mc-
Glynn, A. McLaughlin, L. R. Mead.
Barnett was insistent, holding that there
should be opportunity for the association
to make a selection of officers, and, there
fore, he wished to place in nomination
four good men. The meeting favored him
so far, but when the names of I. M. Scott
and Louis Saroni were mentioned there
were instant declinations, whereupon
Barnett withdrew his plan and asked that
his original motion keeping the polls open
for two hours be rescinded. The associa
tion was obliging and directed the secre- !
tary to cast the ballot for the nominees.
This pro-forma proceeding finished, the
chair declared the nominees elected a
board of directors for the ensuing year. â¢ I
Sonntag brought up the matter of the
proposed exhibition of local products,
which he remarked was the most im- i
portant question before the association.
Manager Tacy made a statement that
the directors of the Mechanics' Institute
had refused to rent the Pavilion for the
purpose of a manufacturers' exnibition of j
California products. The association |
looked around for another suitable build- i
ing, but found none to answer the purpose.
A Jot on Twelfth street had been offered
for a site, but it would cost $60,000 to build
a mere shed for an exhibition building,
and that killed the project.
On motion of Mr. Sonntag the matter
was referred to the board of directors.
Oscar Lewis explained on behalf of the
Mechanics' Institute that that institution
was in hearty sympathy with the maun- j
facturers and producers, out it was gov
erned by circumstances. Without tha
annual Mechanics' Fair the institution
could not live, and therefore the directors
were compelled to take a stand in favor of
their yearly fair as a matter of self-pre
servation.
Mr. Lewis, while on his feet, took occa
sion to say that a man who had made all
his money in California mines recently
signed a large contract for Belgian iron
beams. The inference was the beams
should have been bought from local nianu
iacturers.
SonntaÃ moved that the board of direct
ors meet immediately after the meeting
adjourned and thereupon elect officers.
T: c motion was carried.
An informal discussion of conditions of
manufacturing industries in California
was indulged in by various member?.
Mr. Zan proposed that the association
adopt a trade mark so that the products of
its members could be known and recog
nized by purchasers. His idea was referred
to the directors.
Members were given full liberty to dis
cuss questions bearing upon the welfare of
Californian industries, and the talk was
confined to instances of merchants : and
others importine goods. B The understand
ing was that no action could be taken, as
all business should be referred 1 ;. to the new
directors. : , ; v . ;:, : : '.. " . .... 'â Â-;â.â¢ 'â â â 
McMenomy ,' the wholesale butcher, did ]

me," he said, "every one is speaking for his
own interests. Then I'd like to know if
this association would not protect the meat
industry of California." ' '.â â '"
"That's a matter for the board of direct
ors," the chair remarked. ' '.'*/' ;
"Well, I represent a body of men who
have millions at stake and are deeply in
terested in this â  thing. I J see ' everybody
airing his own grievances, i and > I think I
should have an equal right ; to air mine."
"No, sir," said the chair.
"It seems tome that it is all about iron {
business here," persisted McMenomy. ;
"The iron industry is a very important
one," the chair answered. ? U-/ â '
"Well, I can tell you that there is much
more money invested in the meat business
in California than in the iron trade." . ;
; There was something more about having
to eat California meat and giving it away,
and more about eating machines and giv
ing . them : away, when the meeting ,; ad

THE BUILDERS' ELECTION
In the Choice of Directors Yes*
terday the Carpenters Were
Defeated.
A Change Will Probably Take Place
in the Old Building Contract
System.
Yesterday a new board of eleven direc
tors was elected in the Builders' Exchange
in which the old dominating craft, the
carpenters, were defeated. Four out of
their eight candidates lost, and of the rest
of the board three are bricklayers, one a
foundryman, one a plasterer and one a
painter. The foundryman is President
Lewis.
The following is the result of the 312
votes cast:
Name. Occupation. Votes.

r. L. Hessett. Carpenter 97
A. Kendall. Miilman 33
Robert Sniilie Carpenter 21
John Xottcr Carpenter 17
Tne last fivÂ« were defeated.
As predicted it was a fierce fight, but the
carpenters were beaten from the first. The
old contract system was the issue, and the
result of the election is a blow struck at
the old practice. In the past the carpen
i ter contractor would get the contract as a
i whole, ana after fixing up figures for the
I subcontractors, would let the jobs out to
the painters, plumbers, masons, etc. This
peddling of the subcontracts was not
always good for tbe owner of the building,
especially when the original contractor
figured closely and sublet to cheap people.
"I tell you," said a member of the ex
change yesterday, "some of the building
j jobs in this City* under that system have
been turned out disgracefully. Tne wbole
i thing is rotten and needs doctoring. I
! could stand here all afternoon and tell you
j of the many ways the owner is cinched.
"In the first place, the architect, anxious
to have his plans accepted, puts the cost
of the proposed building too low. They
j always do it, and during my life of iwem
, ty-five years as a builder and contractor I
| have never found an exception. Then the
i carpenter contractor gets those plans anu
j at a glance sees that the figures are too
< low. As he wants to make nil he can he
! goes ahead and sublets on the cheapest
terms and the house goes up, but how?
'â¢Then there is another wrong to be
i righted, and that is in the mutter of pay
ments. Certain trades, especially the men
who supply the material, must get their
! money last. I know people here who
have been waiting for their money for
; years.
"I could point you out fine large build
j ings, a credit to the City, that have not
j been paid for and never will. On some
pretext or other there may be a lawsuit
hanging in the Supreme Court, that tomb
of so many cases, and the thing goes on
unsettled.
"However, the method is changing, as
the election to-day shows, and tne car
i penter contractor must step back for
! the mason and ironworker. Tne letting of
| contracts will go along on other and better
lines, and we will see how that will work."
The Builders' Exchange is in a good con
dition, with $2300 in the treasury and a
membership of 372.
TVondors of California.

FAVOR A HIGH SCHOOL
Board of Education in Accord
With the Residents of the
Mission.
REDUCED FARES ADVOCATED.
Superintendent Babcock's Scheme for
a Two-Cent Streetcar Rate
Favored.
The Board of Education declared itself
in favor of a high school for the Mission
district last evening, and as soon as the
necessary funds are available the institu
tion will be established. A resolution was
adopted declaring it to be the sense of the
board that the Mission district was in need
of the high school, and that it should be
established at the earliest possible oppor
tunity. Director Clinton then introduced
a resolution providing that a temporary
high school be established beginninc with
the next school year. After some dis
cussion the matter was referred to a som
mittee of the whole. Superintendent Bab
cock's old plan of providing cheap fares on
the street railway while going to and from
school wÂ«is brought up again.
Director Henderson introduced a resolu
tion providing for the appointment of a
special committee for the purpose of
wailing upon the officers of the City rail
road companies to ask on behalf of the
board that they make a special rate of 2
cents on the streetcars to school children
on their way to and from school. The
measure was adopted unanimously. This
is a reform which has been agitated by the
department and the parents of many
scholars for years past, and the matter
will be pressed now until the reduction is
granted or the companies definitely refuse
to sanction it.
The complaint of John Blake, charging
Miss Soule, a teacher in the Potrero
Primary School, with having abused his
daughter, was referred to the Committee
on Rules for investigation.
A resolution of thanks to Professor
George A. Merrill, principal of the Cali
fornia School of Mechanical Arts, and also
to Professor Walter N. Bush, principal of
the Polytechnic High School, for their
kindness in delivering lectures before the
pupils and teachers of the public schools
was passed unanimously.
The following recommendations of the
Committee on Classification were adopted :
That the Dudley C. Stone Primary School
be opened on August 3; that Miss Lillian
T. O'Neil and Miss Marion E. Earle be as
signed to the Dudley C. Stone Primary
School, and that Miss Mary R. Uarew be
appointed a probationary teacher and as
signed to the same school.
WIDEN FOLSOM STREET.
Important Meeting Held by the South
Side Improvement
Clubs.
The South Side improvement clnbs held
a joint meeting last night at the hall on
the corner of Folsom and Eighth streets
to take steps toward reducing the width of
the sidewalks between Ninth and Tlnrd
streets; also concerted action toward
overlooking all pas, sewer and water con
nections previous to bituminizing Folsom
stieet.
The question of having the Wilmerding
school of mechanical arts located In the
Mission was advocated in strong terms by
Dr. T. A. Kottanzi, president of the club.
A. B. Maguire explained that from
Ninth street to Army or Twenty-sixth the
sidewalks on Folsom street were fifteen
feet wide. From Ninth street to the wharf
they were nineteen and a half feet. The
present proposition wt;s to decrease the
width of the walks, from Ninth street to
Third, four feet six inches, thus making
the street proper nine inches wider.
Captain George A. Kea said :
"The only way to improve our part of
town is to improve our streets. Then rents
will come up and we will be benefited in
many wuys. Let us make Folsom street
suitable for business as well as beautiful."
Epes Ellery concurred with the previous
speakers.
It was resolved that the names of all
property-owners favoring the proposition
be taken, and one member owning prop
erty from each block between Third and
Ninth was chosen to act as chairmen of
committees to agitate the matter in the
several bluets.
Bailey's Perjury Came.
Charles A. Bailey, the druggist, was ar
raigned in Judge Low's court yesterday on the
charge of perjury. Attorney Long, for the de
fendant, objected to the complaint, arguing
that it was defective, but the Judge ordered it
amended and continued the case till Saturday.

HOW MILLIONS WERE LOST.
History of a Big Deal That Was
Spoiled by C. P. Huntington's
Interference.
With the announcement from New York
that the Transcontinental Association is
in process of reorganization and all coni
-1 ration was about again to be eliminated
The Line-of-Battle Ship Oregon That Is to Uphold the Credit of the American Navy. She Is Now at the Union Iron Works, but Will Be Ready for Her
Builders' Trial Trip in a Few Days.
[Sketched by a " Call " artist.]
from the through freight situation, the
gentlemen having in hand the project of
organizing a through service between this
port and New York, via the Tehuantepec
Kailroad, have taken renewed and in
creased interest in the scheme. As the
gentlemen interested are prominent mer
chants and large shippers, it is claimed
that the enterprise if carried to comple
tion will always remain an independent
and genuine competitor with the overland
railroads aDd the Panama line.
A. K. Coney, the Mexican-Consul Gen
eral, is thoroughly familiar with the
Tehuantepec Railroad, and is strongly in
clined to favor the plan of the San Fran
cisco parties who are negotiating to secure
control of the property. Speaking of the
matter yesterday, he said:
The Tehuantepec Railroad is built from one
end to the other. All it lacks are proper ports
bo aa to give the necessary facilities for ship
ping at both Coalzacoalcos on the one side and
Ham Â»Â« Cruz on the other. At Coatzacoalcos it
will be necessary to jetty the (oatzacoalcos
River and at Salina Cruz a breakwater will
have to be built.
Last year the Government made a contract
with Samuel Brothersof Mexico and New York
for the purchase of a million dollars' worth of
rolling stock and material for the road.
Among other things all the temporary culverts
and bridges are to be replaced with new and
permanent ones.
There are no regular lines of steamers run
ning to these ports as yet, but I don'l thiuk it
will be very long before there will be. I no
ticed in The Call that there are negotiations
on foot so take up the matter of utilizing the
Tehuantepec as a link in aline between New
York, this port and Central and South Ameri
can ports and even for a line to Europe.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure than I
to have the people of California take up the I
project, 88 that would mean progress and in- I
creased conunerce for Mexico as veil as for j
California. In my opinion there is no better j
field for developing the manufacturing and |
eommarciallÃterests of this State than would j
be opened upby just such a scheme as that i
outlined in TÂ»e Call.
The road hti been in running order since
last \pril and has been making a good deal of
money. In fact, it is not able to handle all the
traffic that offer* and that Is the reason that this
million-dollar contract was recently let. VVith
the increase in Us rolling-stock it will be in a ]
position to take care of all the business for i
somÂ« time to cotÂ»e. Should connecting steam
ers be put on it Â«111, of course, be necessary to
put on additional rolling-stock.
It was learned yesterday that a few of
the best knowa capitalists of this City
were in a deal a^ut two years ago to se- ,
cure control of tt* TehuantepÂ«c Railroad,
but allowed the negotiations to drop, with
the result that ttjpy are now mourning I
their neglect to tÂ«Se advantage of the op- j
cortuniiy wherebythey would have nearly j
tripled their investment in two years and
would have realized a profit of. about
$7,000,000.
This syndicate had an offer from the
Mexican Government two years ago to ac
quire a lease of the Tehuantepec road for
ninety years, on condition that they would
complete it. At the time the road had
been mortgaged and $11,000,000 worth of
bends issued, which were bought in Ger
many at 35 cents on the dollar. The idea
was to have the syndicate take up these
bonds, which bear 6 per cent, the holders
being willing to sell at the price paid for
them. The Government also agreed to
give the syndicate the privilege of issuing
bonds on which to raise money for the ex
pense of completing the -road. These
bonds the Mexican Government further
agreed to guarantee.
In the furtherance of this plan E. J.
Molera, the well-known civil engineer, and
Consul Coney were commissioned to go to
Mexico and report on the road aud arrange
the deal as far as lay in their power.
While they were busy on their mission
they were suddenly and unexpectedly re
called and the deal fell through. The
cause for the sudden change of heart has
ever since been a mystery, but one of the
parties interested is authority for the
statement that C. P. Huntington learned
of the scheme, had an interview with one
of the principals, and that thereafter the
matter was allowed to languish and finally
to die.
The bonds of this road, which at that
time were obtainable for 35 per cent of
their face, are now selling for 97 cents and
for par, and had the deal been consummated j
those interested would now be holding se- j
curities for which they would have paid ;
$3,850,000, and which are to-day worth |
nearly $11,000,000. and which would be re- j
turning an annual income of more than j
15 per cent on the original amount in- '
vÂ»sted.
It is acknowledged by a representative â 
of one of the carriers directly interested in J
the Panama route that the Tehuantepec j
Railroad was bound to become an im
portant factor and a rival of the I
! Panama road in interoceanic traffic.
I This eentleman doubted, however,
i whether San Francisco people could be
i sufficiently interested to invest the neces
| sary capital, which he estimated would
1 not be less than $6,000,000, and most of
which would have to be expended for har
bor facilities at the termini of the road.
On this point an interview was had with
I a prominent civil engineer, who has been
| over the ground, and who made a thorough
j investigation of this phase of the matter.
j This gentleman stated that ail the work of
â  making suitable harbor approaches would
j not cost more than $3,000,000. On the
J Coatzacoalcos side it will be necessary to
i jetty the mouth of the Coatzacoalcos River
| so as to scour its bed, and make it ac-
I cesible to vessels of deep draught. It is
j estimated that this can be done at a cost
of f 1,000 ,000, so as to give a depth of not
less than twenty-five feet for sixteen miles
up the river from its mouth.
There are two ways, this gentleman
j stated, in which the requisite accommo
', dations for shipping can be secured
on the Salina Cruz Ride. One is to
j construct a break-water so as to pro-
I tect the roadstead of that port from
the trade winds, and the other is to dredge
' lakes Superior and Inferior, about one
: mile east of Salina Cruz, and then cut a
> nassage from one of them to the ocean.
! This would give a land-locked harbor that
i would be equal to anything on the con
tinent. The rost of the breakwater would
be about $1,000,000, but what the cost of j
the second project would be the gentle
man was not prepared to state.
It is further claimed by those interested
in the scheme, that the operation of j
steamers in connection with the Tehuan
| tepee Railroad will not only provide a com- |
i petitive route between New York and San 'â 
I Francisco, but will enable San Francisco j
i merchants to enter the heart of Mexico by
I rapid and cheap transportation, and would
| also enable cheaper rates to be made to all
j parts of the United States from San Fran
: cisco by operating a line of steamers from
I Coatzacoalcas to New Orleans and up the
Mississippi to the head of navigation.
Cruelty to Children.
Joseph Ault, the ex-foreman of the Standard
j Oil Company, who was arrested on Tuesday
for cruelly beating his little daughter and
was released on his own recognizance by
Judge Conlan, appeared in Judge Low's court
yesterday. The case was continued until
Saturday and Ault was ordered into custody.
He was afterward released on $1000 bonds.
Judge Campbell yesterday sent Mrs. Maggie
Patterson of Clementina street to the County
Jail for three months and Mrs. Elizabeth
Kousch for five months on the charge of
cruelty to their children.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 1896.
THE BATTLE-SHIP OREGON
She Is Now Almost in Readiness
for Her Builders' Trial

in the World.
' . i â 
I
. The trial trip of the Monadnock and the
doings of the American navy in various

to the fact that in a few days the battle
ship Oregon, built at the â¢â  Union Iron ']
Works, will have her official' trial
trip.
She is now almost .'â â¢ completed, and
dredgers are at work clearing the way for
her free entrance to the waters of the bay.
â¢ Once again afloat, she will be taken to
i Hunters Point drydock and there placed
lin readiness for her trial. A special gang of
! men will be put to work, and the big line
i of-battle-ship's bottom will be scrubbed and
cleaned until it shines . like burnished
silver. : The steering gear will be over- j
hauled, ana when . the Oregon leaves the \
dock everything is sure to be in thorough:
working order. A more than satisfactory i
, result is expected, and the Scotts are rest- |
ing on their oars in anticipation of a big
bonus.
If a faithfully built ship ever earned a
premium it will be the Oregon. The very
best material has been put into her, and
| the best engineer? and machinists in the
| United States have superintended her con
: struction. As she appears to-day she la
! the personification of power, not hand
i some in outline, but beautiful in her
strength. As a fighter the Oregon shows
| her power in every line and curve, and
I her frowning cannon give warning Before
they begin to bark.
Judging by her batteries, she is one of
the most powerful ships afloat. In her
main batteries she has four 6-inch guns
and eight 8-inch. The latter are trained
fore and aft, while the 6-inch guns are
amidship. Then there are four 13-inch
guns in the towers, and these can be used
on all occasions.
In her secondary batteries the Oregon
has sixteen 6- pounders, four 1- pounders
and four machine guns.
For small arms she will have 300 rifles
and 170 revolvers. In her other defenses
she will have seven torpedo tubes and ten
auto-mobile torpedoes. Nearly all of the
armament is now on board, and the
chances are that the preliminary trial will
be held next week.
The Massachusetts, Indiana and Oregon
are alike in every respect, but the Union |
Iron Works, the builders of the latter, ex- j
pect to beat the record of the others. Par- j
ticular attention should be paid to these
vessels, as in the case of war they would
be the main reliance of the United States
both for offensive and defensive purposes.
The good qualities of the Oregon are ap
parent to even the superficial observer.
She is superior to anything afloat or de
signed in the world, and the only adverse
criticism that can be made is in regard to
the coal supply at normal draught. "But,"
said a naval officer yesterday, "in order to
obtain the two vital qualities of heavy
armament and admirable protection some
thing had to be sacrificed, and that some
thing was coal. Jut it must be at once re
membered that the Oregon is a coast-line
battle-ship. She is not liable to make long
voyages at sea and will therefore not be
apt to stray far from the home coaling sta
tions. Nevertheless, on a pinch she can
carry XBOO tons of coal.
There is nothing foreign about the Ore
gon. The Charleston was built after the
model of the Japanese cruiser Xaniwa
Kan, and tlie San Francisco and Olympia
were modeled more or less after European
ideas. The new battle-ship, however, is on
the lines desiened by two young Arherican
officers, and in design and buildâ from rivet
to hull, from machine-gun to main bat
tery â she is American and- American only.
MURPHY'S COMMISSION.
Mrs. Colton'a Version of the Affair
Told in a Deposition Head
Yesterday.
The trial of the suit of the First National
Bank against Mrs. Ellen Colton for com
missions for the sale of her house on Cali
fornia and Taylor streets developed some
interesting testimony yesterday.
Depositions of Mrs. Colton and Joseph
A. Baker were read, and in each of them
the statement was made that Murphy
told Mrs. Colton that the selling of her
house would cost her nothing.
Mrs. Colton, in her deposition, went on
to say that Murphy had taken from her
deposits in the bank money enough to
pay for the commissions which he de
manded. She had a row with him in the
office of the bank over the affair and
threatened to bring the matter before the
directors unless he repaid the money.
She said that he himself had told her that
the bank could not transfer money from
depositors' accounts to its own treasury
unless a check was duly given for the
money. Mrs. Colton said further that A.
N. Towne was the tirst one she treated
with in regard to the sale of the house,
and that tHterward, when Murphy came to
see her, he told her that he would not
charge her anything for the trouble he
took as she was a good customer of the
bank.
Joseph A. Baker's deposition was in
corroboration of Mrs. Colton's statement
of Murphy's tender of services.

DUNN SWORN TO SECRECY
Fate of the Sheriff and Recorder
Is Trembling in the
Balance.
HOW THE LAW IS BROKEN.
The Grand Jury Is Now Obtaining
Possession of Important
Information.
When Frank Maskey. the foreman of
the Grand Jury, engaged the expert
services of Horace D. Dunn, the latter
signed a written agreement that he would
not impart to any other person than a
member of the jury the facts disclosed by
the investigations. The expert was also
placed under oath to maintain secrecy.
The Sheriff and Recorder were not taken
by surprise when an expert appeared
among them taking notes. It was soon sur
mised, and present iv ascertained as a fact,
that Mr. Dunn was working for the Grand
Jury and giving especial attention to fees
charged and collected, but not until yes
terday did Sheriff AVhelan and Recorder
Glynn comprehend that mere than tne
ordinary routine visit of the Grand Jury
representative was contemplated. They
learned from The Call yesterday that it
is the purpose of the Grand Jury to in
quire why two officers of the City and
Uounty have taken the responsibility upon
themselves to decide upon the constitu
tionality of the fee bill which was passed
by the last Legislature.
This law, approved March 28, 1895, is
entitled "An act to establish the fees of
county, township and other officers, and
of jurors and witnesses in this State." It
is the law of the land until the Supreme
j Court decides to the contrary. The Grand
I Jury understands it to be the law. County
I Cle/k Curry, to whose office it applies,
recognizes it as the law.
Among the visitors at the City Hall
yesterday were Frank C. Jordan, Clerk of
Alameda County; Thomas S. Bonneau,
Clerk of Marin County, and G. G. Halli
day, Clerk of Solano County. They fol
low the new law in their respective coun
ties and find that it works admirably.
They consulted yesterday and exchan ged
views as to the interpretation of some pro
visions not clearly understood.
The Grand Jury regards the attitude of
the nheriff and Recorder of Ran Francisco
as remarkable. The flimsy excuse is given
that the law is not respected because pri
vate attorneys tell them that the protec
tion of official bondsmen require the old
I repealed law to be observed and the new
law ignored.
The Grand Jury proposes to ascertain
how the bondsmen figure in the case, and
in what way their personal interests con
flict with a proper execution of laws passed
I by the people for the guidance of public
| servants. Incidentally this will lead to a
! Grand Jury discussion as to whether pub
lic offices are created and maintained for
the people or for the men who figure as
sureties on the official bonds of the office-
I holders.
The opportunity for the Sheriff to make
nione} r in bis office is not so readily af
forded by the fee bill of 1895 as it was under
the law which the last Legislature re
pealed. The act approved March 28, 1895,
under the subdivision pertaining to the
Sheriff's charges, contains this paragraph:
"For keeping and caring for property
under attachment or execution such sum
as the court may fix; provided, that no
greater sum than "$2 per day shall be
allowed to a keeper when necessarily
employed."
The old law, which the Legislature re
pealed because it permitted exorbitant
charges, allowed $3 a day for keepers.
It is said that the Sheriff could place
eight or ten attachments under the care
of one keeper and collect |3 for each
attachment. The money is not collected
and paid into the treasury and thÂ«n paid
out to keepers on warrants passed by the
Board of Supervisors and approved by the
Auditor. The transactions consist of
money collected by the Sheriff and paid to
the keeper directly.

VAN NESS AVENUE AS IT WILL APPEAR WHEN CONVERTED INTO A BOULEVARD. THE PICTURE REPRESENTS AN IMAGINARY PROSPECT OF THE GREAT DRIVEWAY LOOKING NORTHWARD FROM CLAY STREET.
[From the plans of the Van Ness~avcnuc Improvement Association.]
VAN NESS AVENUE
AS A BOULEVARD
The Action of the Street
Committee Highly
Favorable.
WILL COST VERY LITTLE
President Law of the Improve
ment Club Hopeful of Its
Consummation.
PAKE FUND NOT AVAILABLE.
Expense to Property.Owners Will Not
Exceed Seventeen Dollars Per
Hundred Feet
The first actual step in the matter of
converting Van Ness avenue into a boule
vard has been effected by the Street Com
mittee reporting favorably on the propo
sition.
Their action at this time means a great
saying, since that portion of the avenue
which is bituminized is at present in very
excellent condition and will so remain
for many years, provided no heavy haul- I
ing is indulged in. Should general traffic i
be permitted, however, it would not be
long before the avenue would be full of
ruts.
it is a common custom for heavy teams
coming down hills to drop a brick or a
log in front of the wheel to check the i
speed, and thus rip up a foot or more of
the pavement. The hauling of heavy
cannon has been especially destructive. ]
Fortunately the Supervisors have taken ;
this matter in hand in time, and the road- j
bed of Van Ness avenue will be protected j
before lasting damage is done. .
A petition was riled Monday, signed by \
the property-owners in ths six blocks j
lying north of Upion street, having for its i
purpose the completion of the plans pro
posed by the Van Ness Avenue Improve
ment Club, cntting a strip twenty-one feet
wide from the center, decorating It with
trees and shrubbery and making shaded i
walks and convenient seats.
In a word, what is wanted is a parkway ]
where one may find recreation without |
taking a long journey to the park for that
purpose, and after all, while Golden Gate
Park is undeniably beautiful and serves a
great purpose, the parks in the center of
our City, where the people may have
breathing space, are patronized far more
thoroughly and are of greater practical
benefit to the masses than a recreation
ground at long range, accessible only
under expense and requiring a long trip.
As now outlined it is intended that six
feet "hall be taken from tue side walks, j
There will be planted grass and palms.
The termination of the present improve
ment will be Fort Mason, which Is to be
laid out very much along the lines pur
sued in the Presidio reservation, and will,
upon its completion, be thrown open to
the public, affording a delightful park of
sixty acres, within easy access of all.
Its value as a park will be greatly en
hanced by the removing of the hill on
Polk street, lyine between Greenwich and
Lombard streets, which will then permit
the Sutter-street cars to continue to within
a few blocks of Fort Mason.
Fort Mason overlooks the bay almost in
its entiretyâ from the Golden" Gate along
to the revenue station and across to Sausa-
Uto and Belvedere, with Alcatraz to the
right and the mountains in the distance â
with the picturesaue inlets indenting the
shores, the whole forming a beautitul
view, and one not apparent in a character
istic way from any other point in the City.
Water always has an attraction, and to
be able to wander along the shore of Fort
Mason, directly overlooking the water,
will be an opportunity not neglected.
Already there is scarcely a Sunday
passes that there are not from 100 to 200
people tramping through the sand in this
section, and when it is once thoroughly
finished, with beautiful roadways and ac
cessible service, it is safe to say that it will
become one of the most sought-after sec
tions in the entire City, botn by the sight
seer and those who love nature.
Returning from Fort Mason the first
prominent street is Lombard street. This
is now in the process of being widened six
feet, in order to make it a fitting connect
ing boulevard with Van Ness avenue.
Along Lombard street is a direct course
into the beautiful Presidio, with no hills
intervening. It is practically one long,
level drive until one reaches the
Presidio, with its magnificent chain of
hills and its splendid driveways, which are
everywhere being extended and widened.
"While the feeling is one of gratitude,"
said Herbert E. Law. president of the Van
Ness Improvement dub, yesterday, "that
the Supervisors have taken such active and
intelligent effort in thi^ direction, yet it is
immediately succeeded by the wonder how
a city so naturally beautiful, with so much
wealth and so cosmopolitan in its char
acter, inhabited so largely by people who
have traveled and visited the most beauti-
I ful sections of the earth, should have been
' allowed so long to assume tbe character of
! a busy workshop, as it were, with merely
a few "avenues for residence.
â¢'lt would seem as though the first con
sideration had been given to trade and the
I beautfying of the residence section of the
! City was adjusted as merely a convenience
j that one might have a stopping place while
laboring. We have often urged against
our wealthy people investing elsewhere â
against the accumulation of money in San
i Francisco and its investment in New York
j and other large cities, and yet we can
I hardly blame them when we for a moment
! glance over the apathy with which we
j have allowed ourselves to drift into a state
:of neglect and indifference. We certainly
i cannot keep people who admire and honor
} our City and invest their monej here if we
I give them no evidence of prosperity, no as
! suranceof activity, no guarantee of return
from their investment.
"Even cultured boston, on her 3 and 4 per
i cent basis, finds ample money with which
Ito improve. Several millions of dollars
| are to-day being spent in Boston, large
j tracts of land are being bought up and
turned into beautiful parks and delightful
driveways. Is it a wonder that people
prefer to invest in such places â that they
prefer to live there? Should not our City,
indeed, be a city of so much attraction
from an esthetic standpoint as to make it
desirable to live in, as well as desirable
from a commercial standpoint?
"It must be remembered that people are
very largely influenced by the pleasurable
surroundings, almost as much so as by
j the commercial advantages. While other
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 1896.
large cities which are spending large sums
of money are compelled to take up most of
the plants in winter time and replant them
in summer, as it were, almost compelled
to repeat the original cost of the work,
San Francisco has no such requirement.
Shrubbery will grow the year around; the
climate is favorable to them.
"San Francisco ought to be made typical
of the State. We spend thousands and
thousands of dollars advertising Califor
nia â its beautiful climate, its picturesque
ness â in a word, we aim to make it the
one hoped-for place of residence for all.
"The cost of making a practical adver
tisement of it â of making the City attrac
tive with drives a"hd boulevardsâ is almost
nominal. In the Van Ness avenue propo
sition the loam would cost about 13 cents
per foot, seed about 5 cents, trees $1 each;
five per 100 feet would be 5 cents addi
tional. One group of shrubs, at 25 cents
each, would make 12 cents more per 100
feet ; seeding 5 cents per foot â a total cost
of $35 per 100 feet of 21 feet wide. If paid
for by each side of the street the coot to
each owner would be about $17 per 100
feet. To this must be added the cost of
excavating three feet.
. "It is not quite certain as to Whether the
City funds are such that these improve
ments can be ordered by the Supervisors.
Should that be the case, it will then fall
upon the owners direct. It is to be hoped,
however, that the City will find some
means of meeting the proposition. If the
present laws do not permit of it, such
changes could be effected as will give them
that power. An improvement of this
character improves the City as a whole.
It is not an individual improvement.
"While progressive property-owners are
willing, as a rule, to bear their portion of
such expenses, yet there are always just
enough in a district opposed to paying out
a dollar to defeat a general movement.
The City government provides for the
park. The same fund should be made to
provide for everything that pertains to the
park in the way" of park ways, which are
of as much greater general benefit to the
people themselves, for the number who
have need of a park way in the City will
by far exceed the thousands who can
afford the time and expense to make long
journeys out to the park. The daily asso
ciation and living amid beautiful sur
roundings are of more beneht to one than
the occasional visiting of a beautiful spot.
"The City's future, in this direction will
depend largely upon the activity and
action of the present board. Their actions
thus far promise much. It is to be hoped
the one radical effort necessary to start
the ball thoroughly on the way will now
be effected by them."

PREPARING FOR ELECTION
Five Hundred Chinese Getting
Ready to Vote Here in
the Fall.
STUDYING THE CONSTITUTION.
The United States Supreme Court May
Intervene by Overruling Judge
Morrow's Decision.
There is activity among the native sons
of Chinatown. About 500 of them are pre
paring to vote at tbe coming election, and
vote they will unless the United States
Supreme Court hands down a.i opinion
setting aside the ruling of Judge Morrow.
And this latter contingency is not at all
improbable. It is rather expectedâ hoped
for, at any rate. Judge Morrow merely
decided, in accordance with the precedent
established by Judge Field, that a native
born Chinese was defacto a citizen. This
was in the case of Quan Wonâ merely a
tesx case. The briefs have gone to the
Supreme Court of the United States. A
decision is hoped for this spring.
But in the meantime, the local Mongo
lian native sons of Californiaâ or at least
members of the Native Sons' organization
in Chinatownâ are preparing to register as
voters. They have learned that they must
be able to read the constitution in order to
get their names on the Great Register, and
now the little brown men in Chinatown
are burning the midnight oil over copies
of the constitution. The constitutional
amendment which makes it obligatory
upon the voter just coming of age to be
able to read and write was ratified at the
election in 1894 and reads as follows:
And no person who shall not be able to read
thr constitution in the English language and
write his name shall ev^r exercise the privi
lege of an elector in this State; provided that
the provision of this amendment relative to an
educational qualification shall not apply to
any person p. even ted by a physical disability
irom complying with its requirements, nor to
any person who now has the right to vote, nor
to any persou who shall be 00 years of age and
upward at the time this amendment will take
effect.
These 500 would-be voters in Chinatown
may or may not be native Americans.
The trouble is there is no way of telling.
They may have been born in this coun
try, and they may not have been. There
is reason to believe a great many of them
were not.
In the past a great many young Chinese
have been admitted to this port as native
sons. Their certificate of landing is, of
course, prima facie evidence that they are
entitled to places on the Great Register.
There are, again, some physicians who
have been known to give certificates of
birth to full-grown Chinese. There are
such physicians in the Citjâ not many of
them, it is true, but one or two could
do and doubtless have done a great deal of
mischief in this way.
Indeed, it is not essential that a Chinese
should have been born in America in or
der to pose as a native son and a great
many ot the 500 who will vote at the com
ing electionâ unless the United States
Supreme Courts decides that the son of a
parent who tannot become naturalized
cannot be a citizen â are, doubtless, na
tive sons of Canton.
PERALTA-REAVIS SWINDLES.
Andreas Sandoval and JoieÃ. Valencia
Arraigned for Alleged Conspiracy.
Andreas Sandoval and Jose R. Valencia,
charged with conspiracy in connection
with the Peralta-Reavis laud swindles in
Arizona and New Mexico, were before
United States Commissioner Heacock yes
terday for preliminary examination.
Mathew G. Reynolds represented the
United States Government as special coun
sel, and Messrs. Catton and Thorn ap
peared for the defense.
The defense asked to have the examina
tion continued until July on the ground
that Miguel Noe, now in New Mexico, an
important witness in the case, would be
here by that time. As Noe is himself
under indictment for conspiracy in con
nection with this great land swindle, the
court thought it improbable that he
would present himself a tew months hence,
an<i ordered the case to proceed.
The prosecution is very anxious to have
Sandoval and Valencia remanded to New

GIVEN NOTICE TO LEAVE
Health Authorities After the
Warren & Malley Hog
Ranch.
The Porkers at the Foot of Laguna
Street Will Not Be Tolerated
Any Lonzer.
Thk Call's expose of tbe existence of a
hog ranch at the foot of Laguna street,
within the limits wnich the regulations
of tbe Board of Supervisors say no
porkers shall be kept, has caused the
health authorities to investigate the mat
ter and take steps to have the evil reme
died at once.
Tbe Health Inspector in charge of the
district was not aware that the firm of
Warren & Malley had maintained a hog
establishment within the limits of his
domain, and hurried to the place yester
day to examine its condition and nee what
could be don*.
He found the pens as described in The
Call and eighteen fat porkers waiting for
their daily feed of swill.
Without further delay a notice was
served on the firm warning them to remove
their hogs at once.
If this notice is complied with nothing
further will be done in the matter, but in
I case the firm does not heed the warning
within the time usually allowed the mem
bers will be arrested "and charged with
violating the regulations of the board.
Market Inspector Rivers also visited the
place to ascertain whether any slaughter
ing was going on within tbe prescribed
| limits. He found a drove of hogs, some of
them weighing $00 to 400 pounds, but dis
covered nothing to indicate that any had
been killed. At the same time he be
lieved that other hogs bad been slaugh
tered to supply the big contractors' camp
with meat. A close watch will be kept on
the place until the contractors comply
with the notice served by the health in
spector. ,

EFFORTS OF THE MERCHANTS.
A Memorial to the Governor and Uni
versity Board Now in Course
of Preparation.
A determined effort is being made to
secure the establishment of the Wilmerd
ing School of Industrial Arts on this side
of the bay. The Merchants' Association
in particular is making a strong fight to
this end. ' Yesterday afternoon a special
sub-committee met in J. D. Phelan's office
for the purpose of preparing a memorial
on the matter to the Governor and Uni
versity Repents. There were present be
sides Mr. Phelan, who represented the San
Francisco Art Association, Hugo D. Kyle
of the Merchants' Association, Alfred
Bouvier of the State Development Com
mittee, and J. Richard Freud of the Mer
chants' Association, who- acted as secre
tary.
Mr. Phelan and Mr. Kyle presented
drafts of the proposed memorial, both of
which seemed to express the sense of the
association on the matter at issue. Mr.
Phelan was requested to use both drafts
in preparing the memorial, which will be
forwarded to the Governor and Board of !
Regents as soon as ready.
"Of the Board of Regents," remarked i
Mr. Freud yesterday, "'eleven live in this j
City, and there are only twenty-two. In
all of these twenty-two sixteen are ap-
Sointed by the Governor, and the others,
cine the Governor. Lieutenant-Governor
and other State officials and heads of State
departments, hold their regency ex-officio.
It is easy to see that any recommendation
by tne Governor may aid our project ma
terially. Mr. Wilmerding's will provides
for the establishment and maintenance of
a school of industrial arts, wherein poor
boys shall be practically taught how to (
make an honest living by the exercise of
certain trades; but unhappily the benevo
lent testator neglected to say where he
wished the school to be placed. But we
have every reason to suppose that Mr.
Wilmerding had the poor boys of Ban Fran
cisco in his mina wniie making the bequest.
"It la urged by those who oppose the
establishment of the school in San Fran
cisco that we have already the Licit and
Cogswell schools, and neeii no other. But
these two schools, both excellent in toeir
way, are not workshops, as the Wilmer
ding school will be, nor have they sufficient
accommodations, since tuev are con
tinually forced to deny admission to
would-be students owiug to their over
crowded condition. The Wilmerding
school will not conflict with either. In
deed, it is strongly desired that it may
unite.if not corpora tely, at least practically,
with the Lick School. Horace Davis
president of the Lick School, is strongly in
favor of this proposed amalgamation, and
is of the opinion that property near bis
institution can be secured at very reason
able rates.
"As to the site, the committee engages
to procure a good location wherever the
Regents may reasonably desire, in case
they decide in favor of San Francisco as
the seat of the school. Only when the
school ; shall be in , active operation will
people realize the ; far-reaching benefits
which it will confer upon the boys of ; the
City. I know of .no similar institution in
this country, unless it be Williamson In
stitute at Philadelphia. This school is a
grand affair, having extensive workshops
with experienced teachers, and, what is of
vital importance, an endowment of about
$1,500,000. It* object is to turn out prac
tical, successful mechanics, and that . ob
ject is certainly realized in a most ad
mirable and efficient manner. The Wil
merding School aims at the same end, and
I cannot see how any one having the good
of i San Francisco at 'heart can fail to do all
in his power to secure, the . school for our
City, where it -would prove a great bless
ing." * ".';' : -v:

NOT GUILTY.
Sudden Collapse of the Cele
brated Blackmail
Case.
NO CRIME WAS PROVED.
Dr. Brown Said He Paid Five
Hundred Dollars Out
of Curiosity.
WANTED TO FIND MRS. BADDIN.
Judge Bahrs Asked Questions Tending
to Assist in the Prosecution of
the Woman at the Bar.
"When the jury, by order of Judge Bahrs,
yesterday morning returned a verdict of
acquittal in the case of the People against
Mrs. Davidson on the charge of extortion,
the entire audience deafened any further
remarks by loud and continued clapping of
hands and stamping of feet, and when the
aristocratic- looKing old lady turned to
leave the courtroom with her face beaming
with smiles, she ran the gauntlet of hand
shaking from hundreds of men and
women who crowded forward to extend
their congratulations.
The fact that she was acquitted on a
mere technicality did not at all cool the
warmth of her reception, and did not at
all cloud the joy which shone in the faces
of her sympathizers. Among these were
many persons who did not approve of Dr.
Brown's personality or of his methods, and
they rejoiced because they reasoned that
Mrs. Davidson's acquittal would be con
strued as a rebuke to the bellicose pastor
wbo had stirred up the dregs of religious
scandals as they had never been stirred be
fore.
It was openly said in the courtroom and
in the corridors by the spectators that the
whole affair looked like a preconcerted ar
rangement; that it was more than likely
that Dr. Brown did not care to have the
details of the ride to Tacoma discussed
and to nave the whole Overman scandal
raked over in a court which could compel
the attendance of witnesses, and which
could oblige Dr. Brown to give the name
of the railway official who, according to
his story before the council, approached
Mattie ? s berth in the Pullman sleeper and
alarmed her. It was a court also that
could demand evidence for the innuendoes
rast by Dr. Brown upon several persons
during the so-called investigation by the
ecclesiastical council.
It was rumored yesterday that' Dr.
Brown and his friends were heartily sick
of the whole affair and wanted paace.
However this may be, it is certain that
Dr. Brown could not have testified in any
other way than he had done before the
church council, so recently held, even had
he desired to do so, because that testimony
before the religious tribunal was given uu
â  ier oath, with great deliberation and with
ample opportunity to amend, correct, am
plify and explain everytning in connection
with the incidents related by him. Hence,
any variation from that testimony would
have been fatal to his case in the Superior
Court.
He was in a quandary. If be had told
the truth before the council he had to
stick to it before the Superior Court, and
if what he had sworn to before the council
was untrue he had to stick to it, no matter
what the consequences might be, for those
consequences could never by any possi
bility be as grave as those resulting from
an admission that he had committed per
jury before a body of his fellow ministers.
Long Â±>efore 10 o'clock, the hour an
nounced for the opening of court, the room
was crowded, an unusually large number
of baldheaded men being observed in
the front row. Downstairs, in what would
correspond to the dress-circle of a theater,
two long benches, well to the front, were
occupied by Christian ladies, all of them
apyarently on the cloudy side of forty. A
few younger women stood near the report
ers' table, and were among the mo3t inter
ested spectators in the room.
Dr. Brown sat behind his lawyers; Mrs.
Brown between him and Deacon Morse.
The doctor spent the greater part
of the time in studying the sphinx
like countenancss of "the jurors. The
prosecution was strongly represented
by District Attorney Barnes, Carroll Cook,
Walter S. Hiukle and ex-Judge Louder
back.
Next in point of interest to the doctor
was Mrs. Davidson. She retained through
out all the proceedings the dignity and
eelf- possession of a thoroughbred member
of society and impressed the spectators
with the idea that she was a very superior
old lady indeed, and they did not wonder
that she had succeeded in inducing the
doctor to borrow $-300 of a bank and to pay
it to her on account of a Mrs. Baddin,
whom he had never seen or heard of be
fore. Her neatly arranged gray hair was
topped with a black velvet turban. Her
cloak was an elegant mantilla of black
Spanish lace, which must have cost, if not
a king's at least a parson's ransom.
The court waited for fourteen minutes
for Juror Nolan, who took his seat with
out any remark, as a matter of course, and
who began blushing violently when Judge
Babrs asked, with just a little satire,
whether his alarm clock hadn't gone on
strike. Judge Murphy, who sat with
Judge Bahrs as a visitor, enjoyed the
Batire so much that Juror Nolan's embar
rassment threatened to drown him in
crimson confusion.
Almost before Juror Nolan had time to
recover from his blushes, Mr. Hiukle be
gan to matehi.s opening statement. There
were no oratorical fireworks in it, it' being
6imply a â didactic narration of facts which
tbe prosecution expected to prove by Dr.
Brown.
Dr. Brown was called to the stand. In
response to questions by Carroll Cook he
proceeded to tell the story of Mrs. David
son's visit to him on November 21 of last
year. On that evening, in his office in the
church, Mrs. Davidson told him that a
certain woman â a lodging-house keeper â
had informed her that some timej>efore
that conversation a minister of the uospel
and a young woman had called at her
lodging-house and had been observed by
her and a lodgei in the commission of a
certain act. The story went to the
effect that on another and subsequent oc
casion the lodging-house keeper visited
her and told her that she bad identified
the minister and the young woman as Dr.
Charles O. Brown and Miss Mattie Over
man.
Dr. Brown swore that Mrs. Davidson
followed this up by calling his attention
to the excited state of public sentiment
over the arrest of Lane and Meyer, and
also to the fact that Dr. Brown had
made a large numbe/ of enemies within
ami without the church by reason of his
attitude on social questions and in the Dr.
Herron controversy. Mrs. Davidson said
further thai the lodging-house keeper in
tended to publish the scandal if Dr. Brown
â lid not puy her a suds of money, aud that
she (Mrs. Davidson) held the secret of the
lodging-house keeper*! life and was acting
as her agent in this matter.
Mrs. Davidson said that the lodging
house keeper wanted $1000 down, $75 by
the tirst of the succeeding January, $45 the
iirst el February and $75 and $45 per month
alternately for ten years. Dr. Brown re
plied that those terms were altogether be
yond his reach. She said that she would
try to secure better terms, and a meet
ing was arranged between her and Dr.
Brown for the next day at Mrs. Davidson's
house. A bargain was finally struck for
$500 down and $35 per month for five years,
Mrs. Davidson remarking that "Thank
God" she had succeeded in making reason
able terms.
The witness admitted that Mrs. David
son seriously alarmed him when she told
him that the lodging-house keeper and
Miss Mattie Overman were going to swear
to the story if necessary. He was afraid
because he knew that if such a story were
published against him thousands would
believe it. It almost drove him mad. He
did not fear the revelation of any secret
affecting himself, but he feared the publi
cation of the story even though it was
false.
"Why did you demand a receipt from
Mrs. Davidson ? M asked Mr. Cook.
"My purpose in getting that document
was to secure tangible evidence to give to
the police of this City to be used in some
way to secure the apprehension and con
viction of ttie person who had defrauded
me," replied Dr. Brown.
"Who had defrauded you?" inquired
Carroll Cook, with a startled air and al
most wailing the word "defrauded."
"Yes," replied the doctor; "who had
extorted money from me."
Then the cross-examination was begun
by Mrs. Davidson's counsel. After a tew
preliminary*questions he touched the vital
point in the case, namely, whether Dr.
Brown had paid the $500 to Mrs. Davidson
through fear of the consequences of a re
fusal, or whether he paid it in order to as
certain the name and identity of the
lodging-house keeper who had threatened
liim with exposure. *
If he had paid the money through fear
and the jury had believed him Mrs. Da
vidson would have a bard battle before
her, but if he had paid the money for the
purpose of ascertaining the identity of
Mrs. Jane Elizabeth Baddin the charge of
extortion would fall to the ground.
"When you were told that a criminal
secret of yours would be exposed, you
knew that there was nothing in your ljfe
to conceal?" asked the attorney.
"Yes," was the reply.
"Mrs. Davidson did not threaten to pub
lish the story?"
"No, sir. She said that she was acting
as agent for the lodging-house keeper."
"You were conscious of your own inno I
cence before you took thi3 receipt, arid you
paid' the money, not because you' had a
guilty secret but because you wished to as
certain who the guilty parties were and tc
punish them?"
"Yes, sir; that was what was in my mind
at that time."
"That's all; I have no further questions
to ask the witness."
This announcement caused a buzz of
surprise among the spectators, the great
majority of whom did not understand or
fully appreciate the point involved.
Judge Bahrs at this stage of the proceed
ings projected himself into the case. Not
withstanding the repeated objections of
the attorney for the defendant he plied Dr.
Brown with questions with the evident ob
ject of having him reply that he was also
governed by tear when he paid the $500 to
the elegant old lady in the costly Spanish
mant>lia.
"Your motive," asked Judge Bahrs, "in
taking the receipt was to secure evidence.
What was your motive in paying the
money?"
"At first," replied Dr. Brown, "the. whole
matter overwhelmed me, but afterward
the happy thought struck me that it would
be well worth $600 to get a receipt and as
certain the identity of the lodging-house
keeper. It would be tangible evidence
against her."
"Was that the only motive?" proceeded
Judge Bahrs.
The question was objected to on the
ground that it was leading.
"It is not leading," decided Judge Bahrs,
sharply. "He can teil what the other mo
tives were. If Dr. Brown is satisfied to let
that answer stand it will have to stand."
"I don't think," said Dr. Brown, "that
was the only motive or the only thought
in my mind. 1 thought then and 1 think
stillâ and 1 cannot see the meaning of all
this dispute here â that it would be a very
happy thought to get a receipt."
Judge Bahrs put another question with
the same object in view. Finally Dr.
Brown said: "Judge Bahrs, I must be
honest and I must tell the whole truth
here. On my way from the bank from
which I had secured the money I had a
feeling of great hope that Mrs. Davidson
would give me a receipt in which the name
of that woman would be mentioned. I
had a feeling in that event that I would be
positively in possession of something
which would be of value at this hour."
"For what?" asked Judge Bahrs quickly.
"For evidence on the charge of extor
tion," was the reply.
"You paid the money," continued Judge
Bahrs, "because you were in fear of the
publication of this" story?"
"Yes," replied the doctor.
"At that time?" inquired Mrs. David
son 'b la wyÂ«r. "At the time of the pay
ment of the feoney?"
"Yes; at that time?" also asked Judge
Bahrs.
Dr. Brown replied in the affirmative.
More questions were put in the same
strain, and more objections were raised.
Finally, Dr. Brown, in answer to a ques
tion by Mr. Cook, said: "I think that in
strict honesty I may say that my main
motive was to secure evidence."
"You say the main motive," interrupted
Judge Bahrs. <; Was there any other mo
tive?"
, Dr. Brown explained that at iirst he had
been willing to do anything in his power
to stop the publication of the story, and
he felt that he would gladly pay $500 to
secure the evidence that would punish the
guilty person.
"I can't see," he added, "what all this
talk is about here. I don't think I did
anything wrong to try to get evidence."
"That's all right, doctor," said Judge
Bahrs. pleasantly. "You can't see it, per
haps, but others can."
The Judge proceeded to remark that he
was not sure that the doctor meant ex
actly what he said.
This raised a laugh, and the court threat
ened to clear out tne visitors in the gal
lery if the disturbance should be repeated.
The defendant's attorney continued tp
protest against the questions put by the
court. The fact that he was the Judge of
the court and was asking leading ques
tions might induce the witness to believe
that it would be his duty to answer in the
way in which the Judge appeared to want
them answered, Mr. Knight suggested.
Finally, after a crossfire of questions and
objections, Dr. Brown said: "I don't think
I would have paid the money but for the
thought that came to me that night to se
cure evidence against the guilty parties."
"You would never have paid her a dol
lar," asked tne defendant's attorney, "un
less you were positive you could "convict
somebody?"
"The moment that thought came to me,
as I stood on Mrs. Davidson's doorstep,"
replied Dr. Brown, "I resolved to pay the
$5U0."
"Suppose she had refused to give you
the name of the lodging-house-keeper,
would you have paid it?"
"I would never have paid a dollar with
out the name," was the positive answer of
the witness.
This answer created an apparent con
fusion among the counsel for the prosecu
tion. Carroll Cook, with a beamimg
smile, suegested that Dr. Brown didn't
understand the technicalities of the law.
The doctor was excused from testifying
any further, and after Detective Seymour
had told of tne result of his invesgation,
Mrs. Davidson's attorney moved that the
court instruct the jury to acquit the defend
ant on the ground that tne prosecution
had failed to show that the money was
paid to Mrs. Davidson through fear. He
quoted several cases in point.
Judge Bahrs thought that the jury
should decide whether Dr. Brown had tes
tified in that way or not and whether he
had only one motive in paying the money.
Mr. Cook admitted that Dr. Brown had
testified that be would not have paid a
dollar if Mrs. Davidson had sot agreed to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 1896.
give the name of the person for whom she
represented herself to be acting.
Judge Bahrs thereupon asked Mr. Cook
whether he consented to the motion for a
dismissal. Mr. Cook said that consistently
with his duty as an officer of the court he
could not ask for a conviction.
The court thereupon instructed the jury
to render a verdict of acquittal, which they
did without leaving their seats.
After Mrs. Davidson had emerged from
the crowd of people who were offering her
their congratulations she was asked
whether she had had any previous intima
tion of the outcome of the trial. With the
blandest of smiles she replied : "I decline
to say anything further about the case."
LOVE WAS THE SUBJECT.
Two Resignations and Four New
Members Were Received.
Contrary to expectation there were no
unusual incidents at Dr. Brown's prayer
meeting last night. Two resignations
were received and four names for member
ship were handed to the standing com
mittee.
In Dr. Brown's opening prayer after the
hymn "Rock of Ages" had been sung, oc
curred a passage which might be taken to
convey a remote reference to some of the
lambs who loved not the shepherd; and
had wandered away from the fold to the
hall of the Native Song of the Golden
West. He prayed for those "whose feet
had been withdrawn and turned away from
this house of God. May the Lord give
Professor Earl Barnes, One of the Three Eminent California Educators Who Will
Deliver Fifty Lectures at the Chicago University.
[Sketched from life by a "Call'- artist.]
them his blessing and accompany them
with his spirit."
The lesson of the evening was "Love," a
theme on which the pastor spoke with
tender feeling. He quoted Christ's epitome
of the commandments.
And, behold, a certain lawyer stood ut> and
tempted him, saying, "Master, what shall I do
to inherit eternal life?"
He said unto him, "What is written in the
law? How readest thou?"
And he. answering, said: "Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
ail thy soul and with all thy strength and with
all thy mind, aud thy neighbor as thyself."
"These commandments % Thou 6halt not,
thou shalt not,' grate upon our inclina
tions harshly at times,' 1 said the doctor.
"They are not prescribed because God
hates us but because he loves us. Love is
thp fulfilling of the law.
"I hope tuat my brethren will pardon
me," he added, "for speaking so long on
this subject. It is a great themeâ very
sweet and comforting."
Brothers Dewing, Vasconcellos, Morse
and Barnard and Sister Rogers and others
were called upon for prayers.
Dr. Brown announced that two resigna
tions had been received.
One was that of 8. Szanick, who
desired to affiliate with the Third Con
gregational Church, "from which he came
to this church with a letter a year ago,"
Dr. Brown explained. The other was from
A. R. Sheriff, who desired to affiliate with
the Third Church.
Rev. Mr. Vartanian, an Armenian from
the Fresno church, offered prayer.
Four ladies applied for membership and
were favorably passed upon by the stand
ing committee. Their names will be an
nounced in church next Sunday.
MRS. DAVIDSON SILENT.
She Declines for the Present at
Least to Discuss Her Legal
Victory.
Mrs. Mary A. Davidson is very loth to
talk of her acquittal, of Dr. Brown, or, in
fact, discuss in any way the characters of
the great scandal, the developments of
which shocked the ministerial and reli
gious world.
The woman who has been instrumental
in causing the downfall of one of the most
eminent Congregationalist ministers in the
land has been suddenly stricken with
silence as peculiar as it is unexpected.
It may be* possible that she has not yet
fully recovered from the abrupt ending of
this trial, due as is well understood to Dr.
Brown's unwillingness to tell Judge and
jury that fear inspired the payment of the
|500. The pastor told the ecclesiastical
council that it was fear which caused him
to pay the coin, but he was unwilling to
make the same statement in open court.
"I am not in a position to talk just
now," said Mrs. Davidson last night, "bs
cause I am still subject to the advice of
my attorney."
''Would yon mind stating if the sudden
termination of the trial came as a sur
prise?" was asked.
"Now that is one of the very things 1 do
not care to discuss now. To morrow I may
be in a position to talk about the case, but
for the present I must not say one word.
I will say, however, and then you must go,
that the case is yet capable of rich devel
opments and that everything will come to
the surface in due time."
Mrs. Davidson was also asked if she
would take any legal steps against Dr.
Brown or others connected with the case.
The aged lady firmly but courteously said:
"Wait till to-morrow."
Surrendered Himself.
W. L. Carwell called at police headquarters
last evening and told Captain Lees be wanted
to surrender himself. He said he saw a Mr.
Adams of Stockton on the street and thought
he was looking for him. He had passed a forged
check for $10 on Adams about two weeks ago.
Captain Lees telegraphed to Sheriff'Cunning
ham of Stockton and received a reply that Car
well was wanted, so he was booked en route to
Stockton.

THEY WILL GO EAST.
Professors Barnes, Flugel and
Moses to Lecture for
Eockefeller.
WILL SPEAK 50 TIMES EACH.
An Innovation in Public Instruc
tion â Advancement of Two
Great Universities.
Professor Earl Barnes of Stanford Uni
versity arrived here yesterday, and is at
the Grand. He says there has been much
rejoicing at Stanford ever since the de
cision giving Mrs. Stanford a victory in the
suit against her. Now, however, every
thing is settling down in the usual quiet,
steady way. He says that as a matter of
fact the decision will not cause any
changes in and about the university, at
least not for probably two years. Mrs.
Stanford will meantime be busy adjusting
legacies and attending to other matters
pertaining to the estate.
Professor Barnes has been interesting
himself in the lectures which are de
livered at the Academy of Sciences in con
nection with tne work of the university,
and are delivered by different Stanford
professors. He says the lectures are not
the success that had been hoped for them,
snd that anyway Californians didn't take
to lectures. They liked amusements more.
j Continuing, he said that lectures seemed
to be dying out over the country. A few
years ago the bureaus were sending out
throngs of men to lecture on different top
ics and they had large audiences, but pub
lic taste had now changed very largely.
The professor said he did not know but it
was a good thing.
"The most important news I can give
you now," said Professor Barnes, "is that
several professors from California are go
ing East this year to deliver a series of sci
entific lectures at one of the great institu
tions. This is important, as it is a new
thing and is advantageous, because it tends
to connect the thought of this coast with
that of the East. The feeling hitherto was
that we were so remote that we must for a
long time stand alone. This has prevented
several educators from coming here and
becoming identified with Stanford.
"Tne institution I refer to is the Univer
sity of Chicago, founded by Mr. Rockefel
ler, and runs on much the same lines as
Stanford University. Both were started
about tbe same time and have been man
aged by young and progressive men. Pres
ident Harper of the Chicago University is
much like President Jordan. The two in
stitutions are sort of path-finders and trail
breakers in the way in which they are con
ducted."
The lectures alluded to are to be deliv
ered by Professor Barnes and Professor
Ewald Flugel of Stanford University and
Professor Bernard Moses' of the University
of California. They will each deliver fifty
lectures.
It is an important innovation and will
create great interest among all educators.
*'I am to speak on the sociology ol
children and the history of education,"
said he, 'and Professor Fluget will con
tinue his work in Anglo-Saxon, delivering,
as 1 and Professor Moses will, two lectures
a day. Professor Harper, of the institution,
is a great organizer and a man of untiring
energy, being much like Dr. Jordan. We
wiy go East probably the last of May to
begin delivering tbe lectures."
Professor Barnes says there are about
1100 students at Stanford. He says the
visit of the University of California ath
letic team to the East last year did a great
deal of good in an educational way. There
has been an increased number of students
from the East, and interest in California
has been aroused. He says, also, that the
strife for able men as instructors has grown
in recent times, so that now a competent
man gets as much as $7000 a. year, whereas
about the highest salary formerly was in
the neighborhood of $3500. "During the
past year or so, however," said Professor
Barnes, "several of us at Stanford univer
sity were offered higher salaries to go else
where, but not one went, except in a single
instance, when a professor went to the
Lick Observatory."
Struck With a Hatchet.
John Summers, grocer, 51 Brady street, was
arrested yesterday morning and booked at the
City Prison on the charge of assault with a
deadly weapon. He was later released on
$1000 bonds. The complaining witness is his
wife Mary. She Bald John was In an ugly tem
per and struck her on the head with a hatchet.
She went to the Receiving Hospital and a
wound in her scalp was dressed. As the doc
tors thought there was a possible fracture of
the skull they wanted her to remain in the
hospital, but she refused.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial. "
.NEW YORK. N. V., ' March 25.â Speculation
at the stock exchange to- day was of a midsummer
. character, the dullness having been extreme. Only
105,900 shares were traded in. Notwithstanding
the dullness the tendency of prices was in | the di
rection of improvement. London bought moderate
amounts of its favorites, and this, with the slightly
higher prices from abroad' and the belief that the
, political situation In the United States as affecting
, the outside world had improved, assisted the rise
which took place in the general list. The greatest
'gains were made in the industrials. Chicago Gas
, advanced a point to 675/Â» on the reports that the
directors intended to - resume â  the payments of
dividends. . '
Tobacco, after an early decline from 83 to 82%,
rose to 84 and closed at 83%. ; The story on the
board was that the directors at their meeting on
Wednesday next will declare a dividend on the
common stock. Nothing official could be obtained.
The reports about a consolidation with the out
side manufacturers were again revived and vigor
ously denied by the Western people who are not in
the combination. It has been remarked that the
American Tobacco directors are singularly quiet
about the matter. Sugar first fell to 114 1 and rose
toil siii@lls. General Electric was â  firmer and
ranged between 35 and 353/ 8 . . .
The* railway list was firm, but "the variations
were merely fractional. St. Paul was strengthened
by the increase in its earnings for the third week
Of March of nearly SI 16,000. Speculation closed
firm, with prices anywhere from Vg to % per cent â 
higher on the day Bonds were higner. . The sales
footed up $792,000. <uchlson general fours cer

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CniCAGO, In., March 26.â There was but
intermittent activity In the wheat market to-day,
the greater portion of the session having no ani
mation whatever. Prices early In â  the day made a
good advance over yesterday, . after which trade
was generally quiet, bnt the firmness which had
developed remained In control. The tone at the
ooening did not afford much encouragement : to.
holders, â  large -' Northwestern receipts, 622 cars
against 413 last Wednesday and 310 a year ago,
tending 10 impart weakness, but an unexpected
sharp demand arose and offerings being light
values rose quite rapidly. Receipts at Chicago
were 19 cars, and 10.983 bushels were withdrawn |
from store. Liverpool cables were quiet aud un
changed. - Bradstrcets report of the world's stocks

One of the most prolific authors of short
stories in England is Mr. Pett Ridge, who
in the brief five years he has been writing
them has produced 250, besides a count
less number of sketches and dialogues.
Mr. Pett Ridge is 35 years old. He is an
employe on a small salary of the munici
pality of London, and this gave him his
entire support until he went into jour
nalism.

WOMAN'S CONGRESS CONVENES.

Oakland Office San FeaxbeboO Call,)
908 Broadway, March 25. j
The question of schoolgirls wearing cor
sets came up before the Alameda County
Branch of the Pacific Coast Woman's Con
gress at their meeting to-day and as a re
sult three fashionably dressed and trini
tigured young ladies left the room.
Dr. Alice Bush of this city was on the
lisl of speakers at this afternoon's session, !
her subject being "Hygene in the Public I
Schools." In beginning she spoke of the j
great improvement in the construction of '
school buildings at the present day over
that of ten or fifteen years ago, bat held
that there was yet large room for im
provement in many things about the
schools and grounds. The smallness of
the grounds with the building on the
south side, making the recreation grounds
in the shade of the building, was objected
to strongly.
The fact that a young man swept foui
rooms, 26x44 feet, in twenty-five minutes
was held as being injurious to the health
of scholars who had to occupy them. Then
she objected strongly to only having the
windows washed four times aj year.
She advocated the use cf adjustable desks
and strongly condemned the present sys
tem of ventilation by means of a fan in
the cellar of the building.
Dr. Bush then turned her attention to
the physical culture class in the Oakland
Hi<-h "School. "1 find," said she, "that
girls are expected to almost completely
change their costumes and don gymna
sium suits, but they don't doit, however.
They do not have the time. They have
only six minutes to make the change,
twenty-five minutes' instruction and then
bix trinutes to change back into their |
6treet apparel.
"In consequence of this lack of time
these young go into the gymnasium
with corsets on and their waistspinned to
their bloomers. The result is that I saw â¢
girls with their arms put up at an angle,
their heads aucked forward and their I
shoulders stooped, instead of their arms .
put up straight, tbeir head and bodies j
erect, as they would have been had the !
evil corset been absent. It must not be !
expected that girls can do the work re- i
quired and do it properly in corsets. It is '
a sad mistake of mothers to put their i
growing girls into corsets.
"Fathers and brothers can do more than
mothers to do away with the corset evil.
They must admire the broad, generous |
waist as it is admired in the growing boy. ;
When they do, then you will see the girls
ready to quit corset-wearing. The men ;
must admire woman as God intended her, I
as nature has planned her, and if they
don't then the physician will get the ben
efit. I found a few girls, however, in the
gymnasium who were properly dressed In j
this respect, but they were few.
"I do wish our fathers and brothers j
would do more to make the girls decide j
not to be so shamefully distorted, but to |
allow themselves to grow in propor- j
tion."
Several stylishly dressed young ladies,
who occupied seats near the door, seemed
to be offended at the speaker's plainness in
referring to ladies' wearing apparel. They
arose and left the room as the speaker
closed. The paper was received with con
siderable manifestations of approval by
the ladies present.
Miss Darrah of the Stanford University, j
Mrs. Griffiu and P. M. Fisher also spoke."
Ballard's Stauding.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 25.â The de- j
cision of the Supreme Court in the case of
the County of Ventura against Henry Clay, j
treasurer of that county, and C. H. Brad- I
ley, to enjoin Clay from paying Bradley's j
claim of $240 for collecting license taxes, i
will have the effect, according to the opin- |
ion of certain members of the Board of
Supervisors, of knocking out the position
of County License Collector, now held by \
James W. Ballard, and requiring the work j
of that office to be done by County Tax
Col lector Barber.
8. P. Siedentopf was appointed as j
Licer.se Tax Collector, but the Supreme j
Court held that the Supervisors, in ap- i
pointing him to that position, had created I
an office which they had no power to do.
The board then evaded the law by agreeing
to pay him 15 per cent commission on all
amounts which he should collect. Two
years ago the board rep'aced him by
naming J. W. Ballard for the position,
which pays nearly $200 a month.
"Don't Shoot, Cattl."
OAKLAND, Cal., March 25.â The city
narrowly escaped having one less practical i
joker to-day than it had yesterday. It vu I
about 10:30* last night when a man entered j
Baptista Catti's saloon at Thirteenth and j
Center streets and thrust a couple of re- j
volvers into the proprietor's face and
demanded his money. Catti was naturally '
enough badly frightened, and told the j
fellow to help himself to anything he j
wanted.
One or two loafers about the place were
intimidated, so that no one dared to offer
the slightest resistance to the outlaw's
demands. Catti was ordered to pass out
the coin and to get a move on himself in
doing it. Catti dropped behind the counter,
presumably to get the money, out instead,
iie grabbed his revolver and aimed at the
stranger's head. Before he couli shoot, j
the man dropped both hands and cried I
out: ''Don't shoot, Catti; lam Casey."
With the remark, Casev pulled off his!
distiguriiu't>eard and explained that it was !
all a joke. Catti declares he wants no j
more jokes played on him.
Assemblyman Coiling Buried.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 2.3.â The fune- ;
ral of the laid Assemblyman H. N. Collins I
was held this afternoon from the Chester- j
street Metnorilpt Church, Rev. L. \\ . Btatty !
officiating. The Berrioea were very simple, I
and were undet the auspices of the Odd
Fellows, of wiifch. order he was a member.
The casket w* covered with beautiful
fioral offerings Irom the family, friends
and orders of \vl|ich he was a member.
The remains v*ere taken to Sixteenth
street station, anfl Â«"t to PJacervilie this
evening for intetment. On arrival there
the remains will X met by the local lodge j
of Odd Fellows, slid taken to the cemetery, i
where services wfcl be held. The family j
and a few intimate'sfriends accompany the !
remains to their la# resting place.
Reducing ttÂ»Â«* Attendance.
OAKLAND, C.u4 March 25. -After Â»!
consultation between the Superior Court
Judges and the District Attorney's office
it has been decided that hereafter the at
tendance at all trials will be limited to

HISTORY OF A DAT.
Alameda County Happenings Told In
Brief Chapters.
Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call,*
908 Broadway, March 25. J
The warrant sworn out by License Inspector
Mitchell aeainst Manager Cook of the Macdon
ough Theater was served this morning, and
Mr. Cook immediately gave bonds. for his ap
pearance.
Judge Greene Is engaged in hearing argu
ment upon the nine indictments against
Myron A. Whidden for felony, growing out of
tne recent scandal in relation to the shortage
in the Tax Collector's office.
F. T. K. Brady, aged 48, a native of England,
who thinks that he is an incarnation of the
Trinity, was committed to Agnews to-day. He
said that the prisoners in the County Jail were
saints and angels. Brady has been insane be
fore.
Officer McCloud filed his bond with S. Hall
and Alex Martin as sureties this afternoon and
will be detailed for duty to-night. He has been
assigned to Officer Sell's old beat, extending
from Grove to Adeline, Twenty-second to
Twenty-eighth streets.
In the inquest on the remains of the man
found in the estuary, the jury returned a ver
dict to the effect that the name, nativity and
time of death of the deceased were unknown,
but as far as they were able to determine he
came to his death by drowning.
The sentence of Benjamin L. Hill, convicted
of murder In the first degree ior shooting his
wife Agnes, was to-day continued one week
pending a motion for a new trial, which will
be made by Attorney Bradley on the ground
that material evidence was not admitted.
Thomas V. Cator, of counsel for E. G. Bus
well, in the suit to determine whether the con
ditions of the franchise of the Seventh-street
local carry a right to free rides within the city,
was in Oakland to-day and saya that an appeal
will be perfected as soon as the decision upon
the demurrer is formally entered.
The final settlement of the bill of exceptions
in the water-front case has been continued to
March 30. The bill has been practically com
pleted for some time, and only awaits the com
pletion of the printed copy and comparison
with the original and the signature of the
Judge.
It is stated that the Alameda Electric Rail
road Company lost $80 last Monday, which is
supposed to have been taken from the safe,
but in what manner is not clearly explained.
It seems to be suspected that some one about
the premises sneaked the money out when no
one was looking.
Julia Atkins, administratrix of the estate of
W. H. Atkins, has amended her complaint
against the Southern Paciflo Railroad Com
pany for $50,000 damages on account of the
death of her husband, who was killed while
coupling cars at the Clark Pottery Wcrks in
Alameda, when he had his foot caught by an
unlocked frog.
TOM KELLY'S GOOD LUCK
He Has Stood Off the People's
Attorney for ' Over Eigh
teen Months.
His Success With Postponements Is
Having a Bad Effect on
Others.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 25. J
A case will be called to-morrow in the
Superior Court that has attracted consid
era-ble attention. It is the case of Tom |
Kelly of the notorious Fish gang of West
Oakland. In August, 1894, Tom Kelly was
held to answer in the Police Court for an
assault with a deadly weapon on an Italian
fisherman. The evidence was considered
to be particularly strong and the informa
tion was lodged against Kelly by the Dis- j
trict Attorney's office, as shown by the
records on August 23, 1894.
Several times the case has been set for
trial, but it has always been continued.
Sometimes it has been apparently forgot
ten for a few months and then it is re
manded for a few weeks "to be reset." Mr.
Kelly has received more favors from the
District Attorney's office than any other
defendant whose name appears on the
records.
Several weeks ago the case came up and
was set for March 26. The speciai attor
ney for the prosecution has not been noti
fied by the District Attorney's office, and
it is not likely that Mr. Kelly will be tried
to-morrow.
The effect of this laxnes3 in the admin
istration of justice is noticed in the in
creased number of depredations com
mitted by the various gangs in West Oak
land. A few days ago rive of them set on
a defenseless man because he refused to
lend them his boat. All the miscreants are
in the City Prison, and maDy other mem
bers of the gang have secured short sen
tences, but the Police Department are
somewhat discouraged by the treatment
they receive from those who should carry
the cases to the higher court. The mem
bers of the gangs are all more or less promi
nent at the polls at election time and are
said to possess a "pull."
HONOR THE BOTS.
Oakland's Boys' Brigade Commeuded
by Veteran Soldiers of Washington
for Guarding the Flag.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 25. j
On Washington's birthday the members
of the Boys' Brigade of Oakland saw a
National flag suspended on Broadway, on
which was printed an advertisement. Be
ing contrary to law, Lieutenant Bird or
dered the obnoxious flag removed and his
order was obeyed.
This morning Lieutenant Bird received
the following indorsement of the brigade's
action :
Chewalah, Stevens County, Wash.,)
March 12, 1896. j
Lieutenant M. D. Bird and the Member* of the
Boyx' Brigade of Oakland, Cal. â Gentlemen :
Noticing an account of your actions on the
22d ult., in regard to the flag hoisted over an
office on Broadway, the members of Union
P .'St No. 70, G. A. R., Department of Washing
ton and Alaska, passed by a loud unanimous
vote the following resolution:
Reeolvid, That Union Post No. 70, G.
A. R., Department of Wawhinpton and
Alaska, feel that when the young
men of our country rise to the occasion, as did
the Oakland Boys' Brigade of California on
the 22<1 of February last, the sacrifices we
and our comrades made In the great struggle
of 1861-65 were not made in vain, and that we
are satisfied that the honor of that old flag
under whose folds we marched to many a
bloody battle will be kept with honor and
n<-v<T a desecration be allowed on even one
star or stripe, and that we would be glad to
take every one of those noble young men by
the hand and give them an old veteran's bless
ing.
May the God of nations ever keep such
young men to maintain our flag unsullied and
kÂ«-i-ji this nation a unit.
\\ ith the greatest respect and profound grati
tude we send you the above resolution.
D. C. ELY,
Adjutant Union Post No. 70.
To Avoid Writer's Cramp.
No one will suffer from .writer's cramp
who will exhibit sufficient courage to
ignore tne established methods of holding
the pen or pencil and instead of using the
two tront fingers and thuiAb place the pen
between the first and second fingers, and
use the third and fourth for a rest. It is
mot-t convenient to write a back-handed or
upright hand in this way, but with a little
practice almost any kind of style can be
adopted. The intense strain on the mus
cles of the first two finger and fhe sympa
thetic nerves in the hand and arm is thus
removed.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 1896.
EDITORS WITH
AN AMBITION
They Are the Youngest
Newspaper Staff in
the State.
ISSUE THE "HUSTLER."
It Is Growing With Fruitvale,
Though Yet of Very
Modest Size.
NOT A POLITICAL ORIGAN.
The Proprietors Set Up All the
Type and Do Their Own
Presswork.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 24. j
l.he youngest editors of a newspaper
duly registered as "matter of the second
class," live at Fruitvale. They are: Edi
tor W. W. Hush, aged 16 years; Assistant
WALTER HUSH, WILLIAM HUSH AND VALENTINE G. HUSH.
Editor V. G. Hush, aged 11 years, and
Business- Manager W. F. R. Hush, aged 10.
The name of this paper, which is published
bi-monthly, is The Hustler, and it de
serves its name.
The ambition of the Hush brothers is to
issue a paper that will grow with the dis-
I trict oi Fruitvale. When it started its
| pages only measured two inches by four,
but it was soon forced to increase to a
sheet double that size. Although not
more than, seven months old the Hustler
is now quite a pretentious two-column,
four-page paper.
Tne three proprietors are the children of
Valentine Hush, the Fruitvale capitalist,
and all are attending school. They do all
the typesetting and printiug besides being
editors and business managers, and in all
branches they make a success.
"We have already got the paper on a
paying basis," said the 10-year-old busi
ness manager to-day, "and as the profit
increases we add to the size of the paper. )
We now print an edition of 150 and ex- j
change with several Eastern periodicals.
Oar idea i 3 to grow up with Fruitvale, and i
we are very generously patronized. We !
do not expect to drive out the San Fran
cisco and Oakland papers just yet, but we
are desirous of being neard from, and shall
reach out for all that is in sight in a
legitimate way.' 1
Editor W. W. Hush realizes the responsi
bilities of his position, but handles the
editorial pen with marked justice and im
partiality. "We are not here to usurp any
authority or to delegate to ourselves a
censorship over the various political par
ties. We do not have any idea that our
voice will have any marked effect on the
chances of the men who may be nomi
nated for President, but in our columns
can be found some of the youthful literary
talent of this rising district. This of course
is our stock in trade, and the events of the
outside world pale into insignificance be
fore the happenings of Fruitvale. We are
working on the principle contained in the I
mo,tto of the Hustler, 'Little strokes fell j
great oaks.' "
Under the leading "editorial" the boy
editor wrote as follows after, it is evident,
receiving encouragement for the Hustler
from his school teacher:
We want to thank the worthy principal of
the Gartield School for her very kind words,
"Great things have come from smaller begin
nings," as well as her subscription for a ye.-ir.
Mrs. Gibbs has been at the head of the Gariield
School for the past nine years and many of us
boys feel we owe her a great deal for her wise
counsel and beautiful example.
Assistant Editor V. G. Hush attends
to the news and the features when he is
not setting type. When news is scarce he
prints poetry and this week there appears j
an original contribution on "The Clouds," j
which fills just one column.
The request is made "Exchanges will
please send three copies." When asked
whether this was intended as a joke or j
whether the request is serious the business j
manager stated that it was made in good I
faith. "We each have our own files, he '
said, "and you know how unpleasant it is I
to have any clash between the business '
and editorial departments." The Hustler \
is certainly hustling.
STUDENT MASS MEETING
Berkeley Collegians Will Con
sider Means of Sending the
Athletes East.
Progressive Club Meetsâ Co-Eds Train
for Basket-Bail Contest With
Stanford.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 25.- A mass
meeting of the entire student body, co
eds and all, will be held next Monday
afternoon for the purpose of devising ways
and means of sending the track athletic
team across the continent again this sum
mer. Manager Friend and Captain Mer
win have several propositions to make to
the students regarding the raising of
money to defray the expenses of the pro
posed" tour. Plans for holding benefit
concerts, field days and other entertain
ments will be offered for the considera
tion of the students.
The management seems absolutely cer
tain that the financial end of the under
taking will be properly attended to, and
that the one thing which will determine
whether another trip is practicable at this
time is the question of how well the ath
letes show up before time for leaving.
Friend says that the debt now stan ding
against the athletic team as a result of last
year's venture will be paid off before the
"team leaves Berkeley. lie stated that al
though the total amount borrowed was in
the neighborhood of $2500 only about $250
of this was required to be returned, as the
remainder had been loaned on the condi
tion that it be paid back Irom the "net
proceeds'! of the trip. As there were no
"net proceeds" only that which was loaned
the team while they were stranded at
Denver in order to reach home on has to
be paid back.
"The students," said he, "do not seem to
want the other money back. They are
willing to let it go as a donation to the
good of athletics. As for the raising of
enough to carry the team through this year,
I am positively certain that the amount
can be raised if the contributors are as
sured that the team will equal that
of last year. The friends of
the university all over the State
took the deepest interest in the success of
last year, and were overjoyed at the honor
brought California by thebrilliant work of
the team, and I am sure that they will go
down in their pockets and help along the
project. It is not an affair of local inter
estâit is a matter of consideration for the
whole coast. Besides what will be secured
from the gate receipts at the games, we
will doubtless have liberal contributions
from the alumni and students, as well as
other friends throughout the State, and
from entertainments and Exhibition con
tests. We have already arranged to par
ticipate in the Fabiola May fete, which
will net us a neat sum, and then we will
have a baseball game at Central Park be-
[ tween the Glee Club and the football
i team. I have been in office but one day,
and, of course, have not fully planned
what other benefits we can get up."
Co-Eds Training Hard.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 25.â The bas
ket-ball team at the university is training
i daily for the contest with the Stanford
i team on the 4th prox. Manager Brownsill
j and Captain Uriswold have set, down strict
i training rules for the players to observe,
and the young women are going into the
work as it they meant business. Mr. Ma
gee, head of the department of physical
culture, says that the girls are putting up
a fairly good game, with but little tum
bling and rough scrimmaging. He says
further that they are somewhat handi
capped by the short time in which they
J have to practice. The officials of tho game
â  have- not yet been named, but Manager
Brownsill expects that the matter will be
settled iv a few days.
Progressive Club Meeting.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 25.â The reg
! ular meeting of the West Berkeley Pro
j gressive Club was held last night. The
I variom committees that were appointed
I at a former meeting to investigate projects
\ of improvement brought to the attention
of the club were not ready to report and
the evening was spent in general discus
sion. A communication from C. A. Bailey
was read, stating that several weeks' work
would be required before the committees
could hope to make reports.
Bhoner'i Operetta.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 25.â The
Woman's Relief Corps met yesterday af
ternoon and perfected arrangements for
the production of the operetta, "The Ban
dit, 1 ' by A. S. Rhoner, which will be eiven
on Friday evening, April 10, in Shattuck
Hall, Tne performance will be for the
benefit of the Woman's Relief Corps.
Mass- Meeting Called.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 25.â The Car-
I centers' Union of Berkeley has called a
I mass-meeting for next Monday evening, to
be held in Pythian Hall. All workmen
I connected with the building trades will

I painters' strike.
Foresters' Entertainment.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 25.â Court

Son and Father.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 25.â When the
i case of the People vs. Albert JMenzen
i meyer, wno shot John Perkins at Lorin
â  last C.iistnuis eve, was called in court to-
I day, father ana son met as Opposing coun-
I sel. The defendant is represented by At-
I torneyA. A. Moore, and owing to the other
matters pressing iiiru requested a con
tinuance.
Deputy District Attorney A. A. Moore
Jr. had been detailed to appear for the
! people. When the request came up Judge
i Ureene turned to the sou and asked, "Do
1 you consent?" The son consented, and
i the case went over. It was remarked that
it is seldom a son had to be consulted by
the father to get his request.
The civil suit of Perkins against Men
zenraeyer for $10,000 damages as a result of
the inj'uriesvreceived that night, has been
compromised. It is understood the figures
are $2500.
Dr. Crowley Sued for Divorce.

Crowley, has announced her intention to
sue fora divorce on the ground that her
husband has been unfaithful. Her attor-
I neys are W. R. Davis and F. L. Button.

! K. M. Fitzgerald to act as his attorneys.

in a wild manner. On being shot it was
discovered to have a laree oak leaf im
paled upon its beak in such a way as to
tally obscure its vision.
TO PERFORM FOR CHARITY

Another pretty charity work to be done

raising the needed funds an operetta, "The
Rival Queens," is to be presented by sixty

The Electric- Light Injunction.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 25.â Work on
the city's electric station is proceeding,
notwithstanding the injunction. This is
in accordance with permission given by
the Judge and acquiesced in by the
attorney for the complainant in the in
junction proceedings to enable sufficient
progress being made to protect the
machinery from the weather. Imme
diately after the first proceedings were
begun the most extensive work was
planned and begun by the contractors. A
side of the building was torn out, exposing
the dynamos and engine, and pits were
dug for foundations for the new engines,
weakening those upon which the old
engines stand. Then the injunction was
secured, which found things in a bad
way, and if it had not been relaxed public |
interests would have suffered. The com- |
plaint upon which the injunction was
based has been in essentials sustained,
and it is regarded by the lawyers as being
quite probable that the point raised is a
good and valid one.
Case of Mania.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 25. â Mrs.
Henry Kustel, the wife of an as9ayer, will
be examined tnis afternoon by the Com
missioners of Lunacy. Her examination
will come up through the complaint of her
neighbor, Mrs. Otto Brewett. The accused
woman has a mania that her accuser keeps
her from sleeping through hypnotic power.
She believes that some 200 people, includ
ing Charles Neal and Michael Kane, are
subject to hypnotic spells also. Mrs. Kus
tel has greatly frightened and worried Mrs.
Brewett because of her strange delusion,
at one time knocking at her door and |
striking her with a whip when it was
opened, and at another going to the back
door with a club with the expressed deter
mination to kill her. Mrs. Kustel and
Mrs. Brewett were never at enmity and
have long been acquaintances. Mrs. Kus
tel is the mother ot three children and her
husband is away in the mines.
Municipal Money Short.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 25.â The final
payment on the construction of the new
City Hall was ordered last night at tbe
regular meeting of the City Trustees. It
was in tne sum of $7949, and was due
Thomas Day & Son, the principal con
tractors. A* warrant for this amount was
this morning presented to City Treasurer
Wheeler, but as there was not money
enough in the fund against which it was
drawn to pay it it still remains uncashed.
Fund No. (j, which is the City Hall fund,
is 11100 shy of the required amount to
square all demands. The Municipal Board
will be called upon at its next meeting to
do some financiering in order to supply
the deficiency.
Electric Railroad Burglary.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 25.â There is a
rumor about town that the safe of the
electric road has been burglarized. The
managers of the road say it is not so.
The police say they know nothing about
it, but the men who know about the rail
road offices say that $310 was taken from
the safe on Sunday night by somebody
who must have had possession of the keys.
IGNORANT VOTERS' IDEAS
County Clerk Jordan Asked to
Change a Man's Birth
place.
Some Applicants for Registration
Never Heard of the Educational
ReQuirement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway-, March 25. \
Many curious incidents occur while the
deputies in the County Clerk's office are
handling the affidavits of registration.
While there has not yet appeared any
one who did not know his name there
have been many who do not know their
age or the place of tneir birth.
This aiternoon a man asked Chief Dep
uty Ewing to allow him to take advantage
of the act allowing a man to change his
birthplace. Ewing replied that he knew
nothing of such a law and that no such
act was in existence.

pirant for voting honors. "My place of
birth is England, Iwant to swear that I
was born in New York. If I can do that
then I can register."
The deputy argued with the applicant
on the foolishness of his position and tried
to show him his error, but the man was
obdurate and said he would call again
when "somebody's hin who hunderstands
'is business."
Many people apply for registration who
are laboring under the delusion that they
have to make affidavit to their religion.
Clerk Jordan has informed scores of appli
cants tha,t there is a clause in the eon-ti
tution thai leaves it optional with a man
j to believe as he likes, independent of his
I neighbors. In Alameda County the re
ligions controversy of the past few months
has created the greatest interest, and
many voters who do not usually make use
of the English language have informed the
clerk of their religious affiliations.
"While it would be of great interest and
probably of much use to candidates," said
County Clerk Jordan to-day, "to have the
great register compiled so that it could
be used as a religious and fraternal direc
tory, I realize that this is America. The
various amendments to the constitution
that are suggested by some of the ques
tions a?ked us are not, in my opinion,
quite necessary for a republican form of
government, and I prefer the constitution
as it is."
Occasionally an applicant for registra
tion will go to the clerk with an inter
preter. Tne applicant iv many cases has
.not been able to speak a single u-crd in

English, and the interpreter expressed
great surprise when told that there was an
educational requirement in connection
with the registration business. Several
times aliens go to the clerk prepared to
answer all sorts of questions that are put
to people who are anxious to be natural
ized, thinking that he is a Superior Judge.
The registration is making rapid prog
ress, and County Clerk Jordan says that,
although it is not costing the county %
cent, it will be out. on time.

THE STRANGLER
STILL AT WORK
Twice Tried to Murder
Irene Wilson on Sutter
Street.
CLUTCHED HER THROAT.
Gained Admittance to Her Room
Under a Pretext and At
tacked Her.
HELP CAME JUST IN TIME.
The Police Are Now in Possession of
a Good Description of the
Miscreant.
All efforts of the police to find the
strangler who has, by his murderous
work, terrorized fallen women in the City,
have been in vain, although he has given
within the paat two or three days prac
tical evidence of the fact that he has not
left the City.
On Monday night Irene Wilson, a line
looking young woman living in the
lodging-house 304 Sutler street, was in her
room when some one knocked on her
door. She opened it and was confronted
by a wcli-dressed man of about 40 years of
age. He was a man of fair complexion
with a curled blonde mustache.
She a^ked him who he was and what he
wanted. "I am a sporting man," he re
plied, "and lam out for a little fun." He
walked into the room, ancl as soon as the
door was closed he grasped her by the
throat with both hands. She screamed and
he released his hold of her throat and
with a smile remarked, "Don't be alarmed;
it's only a josh."
He talked so pleasantly tfeat sne became
reassured. In a short time he made some
flattering remarks about her shapely neck,
and. as she is a little proud of it, she per
mitted him to fondle it. Suddenly he
seemed transformed, and, with his eyes
blazing, he again sirasped her by the throat
with both hands and proceeded to strangle
her. He forced her down on the floor and
she shrieked with fear and pain.
The landlady's son heard her screams
ami rushed upstairs to her room. The
strangler apparently neard the footsteps
on the stairs, for just as the boy reached
the top he rushed out of her room and ran
downstairs and out into the street.
Miss "Wilson was so unnerved by the
shock that she was confined to her bed till
yesterday, and last night she reported the
affair at police headquarters. Her throat
still bears the marJc of the etrangler's
lingers.
She was able to give a geod description
of the man, and Captain Lees is satisfied
he is the same man who strangled Mamie
McDermoti on Morton street and Bertha
Paradis on St. Mary street.
The police will now redouble their ef
forts to capture him, and as they have at
last a good description of him they expect
to have him behind the bars very soon.
About a week ago the same man at
tempted to strangle a young woman on
Ellis street, near Stockton, but her screams
frightened him away.
IS HEYDENFELDT'S WIDOW
Mrs. Henrietta Duvall's Position
Defined by Judge
Troutt.
The Decision Has an Important Bear
ing on the Case Now Be
fore Judge Ccffey.
A suit for $10,000 damages was pending
before Judge Troutt in which W. B. Hel
lings and Zeila O. Hellings sought to re
cover from James L. Crittenden and Mrs.
Henrietta Duvall for fraud.
Mrs. Hellings is one of the heirs of the
Heydenfeldt estate, and the claim was
made that Crittenden and his client had
fraudulently introduced themselves into
the caÂ«e, she as Heydenfeldt's widow and
he as her attorney. The complaint stated
that Mrs. Duvall was old and weak minded,
and that Crittenden had persuaded her
that she had at one time been Solomon
Heydenfeldt's widow, in order to compli
cate the estate and get some of its gold.
Judge Troutt's decision in the case has
been handed down, and it has a material
bearing on the case now in progress before
Judge Coffey. In his findings Judge Troutt
says that:
The defendant, Henrietta Heydenfeldt, sued
as Henrietta Duvall, is not and never was a
half-sister of Solomon Heydenfeldt, deceased,
but that she is the stepsister of Solomon Hey
denfeldt, and ever since the 20th day of Janu
ary, 1853, has been the wife of said Solomon
Heydenfeldt.
That said defendant Henrietta was married
to said Solomon Heydenfeldt January 20,
1853; that said marriage was solemnized at
Sacramento, in the State of California, by
Hugh C. Murray, the Chief Justice of the Su
preme Couri of the State ol California, in tne
presence oi two other witnesses; that immedi
ately upon the conclusion of the marriage
ceremony the said Hugh C. Murray, as such
Chief Justice, prepared and signed, and the
paid witnesses attested and witnessed the mar
riage certificate, setting forth and certifying
that L'enrietta Manahan and Solomon Hey
denfelat were married by Hugh C. Murray,
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the State
of California, on said last-mentioned day,
at the city ol Sacramento, in the said State;
that said marriage certificate was then and
there delivered by said Murray to said Solo
mon Heydenfeldt, and was afterward delivered
NEW TO-DAY.

by the said Solomon to the said Henrietta, and
that said Henrietta subsequently delivered the
same to said Solomon Heydenfeldt and has
never since had the same; that the maiden
name of the defendant Henrietta was Mana
han; that thereafter the said Henrietta lived
with the said Solomon Heydenfeldt as his wife
and gave birth to three children, the children
of herself and Solomon Heydenfeldt; that
from the time of the marriage of said Solomon
Heydenfeldt and said Henrietta Manahan on
said 20th day of January, 1853, down to the
time of his death, the said Solomon Heyden
feldt and the said Henrietta were and con
tinued to be husband and wife, and said mar
riage was never in any way dissolved or ter
minated till the death of said Holomon Hey
denfeldt.
Crittenden is exonerated by the findings
from any charge of irregular practice, and
all damages are denied the plaintiffs.
There is now a suit on trial before Judge
Coffey by which Mrs. Duvall is seeking to
recover what she considers her share of the
estate. The counterclaim is made that
she was never Heydenfeldt's wife and that
she was his half-sister. The decision of
Judge Troutt settles these points.
THE BANK ROBBERS.
An Officer With the Papers for I.ough
ridge's Extradition J.eft for Here
Yesterday.
William Loughridge, the Savannah bank
robber, appeared again in Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday morning on the
charge of carrying a concealed weapon.
At the request of his attorney the case was
continued till April 8, bail being fixed in
$1000, the Judge remarking that it made
little difference what the amount was.
The argument on the writ of habeas cor
pus will be heard before Judge Slack this
morning, but there i<Â» little chance of its
.being granted, as the police force have too
much damaging evidence to offer.
Captain Lees said last night that a charge
of receiving stolen property would prob
ably be booked against Frank Williams,
the man who gave the two stolen bonds to
Dr. Lee to negotiate. Dr. Lee is still de
tained in the "tanks."
The officer from Kansas City, Mo., with
the necessary extradition papers for
Loughridge's return left there yesterday
and may be expected here Friday night or
Saturday morning.
Loughridge is said to belong to an influ
ential family in Kansas City. He got into
bad company and turned gambler, and
then bank robber.
SUTRO IS A UNION MAN
Unaware That the Presidio Band
Belongs to Unorganized
Labor.
Says He Will Employ None but Union
Musicians to Perform at
the Baths.
The efforts of the Musicians' Union to
have union labor employed at the Sutro
Baths have apparently borne fruit, for
Mayor tsutro declared himself emphati
cally yesterday in favor of having none
but union men employed at his establish
ment.
When the Presidio band was installed
at the baths the union arose in arms be
cause the members of the United States
organization are not members of the
union. It was understood that the band
had been engaged for a long period, and
the union leaders declared that if such
were the case they would not only boycott
the baths, but would appeal by wire to the
Secretary of the Treasury to prevent the
Federal authorities at the Presidio from
allowing the band to play at the baths.
"This talk of my having trouble with
the union is all rot," said the Mayor. "As
a matter of fact I did not know that I was
employing non-union men when I en
gaged the Presidio band through my
manager.
"I believe in organized labor and home
talent, and shall by all means call in
union men when we form a permanent
band.
"When the Cassasa band was engaged
I had no idea of the expense, and made up
my mind when the week's bill of $380 came
in that we must do with a cheaper aggrega
tion in order not to run behind. Ido not
mean that we wanted cheaper men, but
that we must get along with a smaller
number. Cassaaa's band was only en
gaged for a short time, and when its time
was up we called in the Presidio band for
a brief engagement. I shall ascertain what
the union men want* and will employ a
sufficient number of musicians to do our
work and still keep the expense down so
that the baths will not be a losing proposi
tion."
LIFE-SAVERS' PENSIONS.
Lighthouse-Keepers Petition Congress
for Beliefâ Many Reasons Given
for This Coarse.
A bill to retire and pension employes of
the lighthouse establishment has been
formulated by the Light Keepers' Associa^
tion of the United States and Congress
will now be petitioned to pass the same.
The bill is in three sections, and each sec
tion contains one general proposition which
may be subdivided.
Section 1 provides that all keepers and
assistant keepers of lighthouses and fog
signals and all persons connected with
lightships and lighthouse tenders shall be
entitled to retire upon half pay after
twenty-five years service, or shall be re
tired by law upon attaining the age of
65 years upon half pay if they have
served twenty years or more, or one-third
pay if they have served less than fifteen
years.
Section 2 provides that if any person
mentioned in section 1 is taken ill or is in
jured and a careful medical examination
demonstrates that the disability will be
permanent such person shall be entitled to
half regular pay at the time of the
accident, injury or illness, and that it shall
continue for the term of his natural life.
Section 3 provides that if any of the
above-mentioned Dersons die from acci
dent, injury or illness contracted while in
the line of duty the widow and minor chil
dren sliall be entitled to a pension of
half the salary of such employe at the
time of death, to continue in the case of
the widow for the term of her natural life,
but to cease in case she remarry, and to
continue until the minor children reach
majority.
Amoug the reasons urged for the passage
of the bill it is stated that the duties are
arduous and uf times hazardous in the ex
treme; that the mental and physical strain,
taken with the forced isolation of most of
the posts, renders the employes unfit for
other duties after some years of service ;
that as they are deprived of the benefits of
education and religion, and often of medi
cal assistance, their lives are made lonely
and dreary, and that the relief asked for
has already been granted to other services
of the Government, such as the army.
In corroboration of their life-saving ef
ficiency the instance of John Brown,
keeper of the Bonita light, who has per
sonally saved twenty-one lives, is quoted ;
and an example of the dangers incurred in
the discharge of duty is given in the case
of John Ross, lormerly mate of the light
house tender Shubrick, who with others
was disabled for life; also in the case of
the inspector of the Twelfth and the en
gineers of the Fifth Lighthouse District,
who lost their lives along with the boat's
crew while landing supplies in almost inac
cessible places.

Elopement of H. G.Robinson
With Miss Nina Maude

MANY JEALOUS SUITORS

The Bride the Daughter of George
Smith Said to Be Worth

TEE GROOM'S BOLD STROKE.
He Borrows $7 of One Friend and $2
of Another, and Then Flees With
His Inamorata.
One of the latest romances here, and one
that is causing much interest among their
friends who have heard of it, is that of
Horace G.Robinson and Miss Nina Smith of
this City, the latter the pretty daughter of
George Smith, a mine-owner of Siskiyou
County, reported to be worth $500,000,
formerly the partner of ex-Governor John
L. Daggett.
Mr. Robinson, who is barely 22 years
old, has been endeavoring to gain the
hand of Miss Smith for several months.
She had many suitors, however, among
them one or two quite wealthy men,
whom her relatives much preferred to
Miss Nina Maud Smith and 11. G. Rob
inson, Whose Romantic Elopement
Has Caused Much Stir.

Robinson. The latter, realizing the . tre
mendous odds against him, determined to
get the young lady at all hazards. The
enterprising youth needed money, how
ever, even â¢if â  the lady would ; consent, in
order to get that necessary adjunct : of ; all
weddings, a marriage license. . In despair
he thought he would make a borrow of â  it.
j He tried several places and failed, and was
almost desperate, when : happening Jto
meet- an 5 elderly friend, â '. he was assured
that not only should he : have the $2, but
more if he wanted. j , *^ .; : ". : ,}j/. \<. .
Thereupon he borrowed the large sum
of $7, and meeting Judge Watson a -little
later was fortunate enough to ; secure '$2
more of him. Meeting his inamorata a
I short time after at a dentist's office, he so
influenced her by his eloquence that she
at once forsook all her other admirers and
fled with him to Oakland, where they were
joined in wedlock, despite the objections
of the relatives. â ' ' """ "' i'
Then now to Keep the. matter a secret,
until the relatives could be reconciled to
the ; situation, was the problem ; before
them. They dared not go home, and they
knew not what to do. Still they were ex
quisitely happy. The ; newly made bride,
unable to have cards punted for the few
friends to whom she could confide, con
i tented herself with writing this card. It

TANGERMAN'S SUCCESSOR.
Hale & Norcross Directors Have Not
Yet Appointed Him.
Jere Lynch, president of the Hale <fe
Norcross Mining Company, is still in San
Francisco, and will not return to Virginia
City until after the next meeting of the
directors of the mine.
In regard to the appointment of a super
intendent to succeed Mr. Tangerman, Mr.
Lynch is as silent as the Sphinx of Egypt.
He neither admits nor denies that the
directors contemplate a change. "If you
want to oblige me," he says, -'quote me as
saying nothing."
Among mining men familiar with affairs
on the Cornstocs: it is believed that the
company will soon appoint a new super
intendent.

POLICE TO AIM RIFLES
Great Intefest Manifested Here
and in Oakland in a
Match.
NAMES OF THE TWO TEAMS.
The Result Is Expected to Be Close
and Exciting, With Oakland
Slightly Ahead.
As the time for the rifle match between
ten men of the San Francisco and Oakland
police forces approaches the interest in
the result increases.
The match will take place at Shell
Mound Park on Saturday afternoon, com
mencing at 1 o'clock. Colonel Sam Beaver
of the Bank of California will act as
referee for the San Francisco team and
Colonel Robert McKillican, ex-Sheriff of
A lamed a County, will perform the same
office for the Oakland team.
The personnel of the teams is as follows:
San Franciscoâ Smith Carr, O. C. Phillips,
Sergeant Nosh, P. C. Peters, Hurry Hook, W.
W. Wilson, Thomas A. Atchison, George P.
Mulcahey, J. H. Flynn and O, B. Merrick; re
serve men, James Foley and John Fleming.
Oaklandâ Nick Williams, D. W. Swain, J. F.
Sill, J. M. Cockerton, Fran* Schroder, C. E.
Clarke, W. Kingsbury, L. E. Andrews, J. J.
McCarthy and H. C. Arnest; reserve men, J. F,
Stahl and W. F. Peterson.
Captain "Wittman feels the utmost con
fidence in his team, and is satisfied that
the other fellows will have to bear the
cost of the dinner to both teams after the
result is known. Captain Fletcher laughs
in his sleeve, and tells hi 3 friends that the
Oakland men will have a picnic.
Outsiders who have watched the two
teams practice believe that Oakland will
have an advantage in the fact that the

Oakland police force have been practicing
together for a long time on that range,
and a large number are rated as being pro
ficient with the rifle.
In the San Francisco team there are sev
eral new men who have never shot in a
match before, who may make good prac
tice scores, but when firing in a match
may not do such good work. Some of the
old shots like Smith Carr,- Sergeant Nash
and Harry Hook, assisted by O. C. Phil
lips, who is familiar with all-round shoot
ing, will have to do great work, as some of
the new men may get on a nervous fit.
The team has not had sufficient practice at
the Shell Mound range, and in this they
will labor under a disadvantage. They
have had lots of practice in an inclosed
range with artificial light, but there is a
great difference in firing in the open air
with the changing natural light.
The contest is expected to be close and
exciting, and if the new men on the San
Francisco team keep their nerves steady
they may astonish the Oakland men who
think they have a sure thing.
MAY CAUSE SCHISM.
Superintendent Brown of the German
Hospital Talks of Hia
Troubles.
The action of the board of directors of
the German Hospital last Tuesday night
in refusing to accept the resignation of
Superintendent Brown is likely to cause
trouble in that institution,
"There is absolutely no personal differ
ence between President Broemmel and
myself," said Superintendent Brown yes
terday. "The president is of the opinion
that expenses should be materially re
duced and at the same time a better
service given. I have been superintendent
of the hospital now for three years, and I
claim that such a thing is impossible in
face of prevailing competition.
"I admit there are several places where
a saving could be effected, and I am going
about this aB rapidly as conditions will
permit. What I did rebel against was the
president's attempt to tell me how to con
duct the minor details of the hospital.
For instance. I did not want him or any
one else telling me when I should go to
bed and when I should get up. It was
mainly in just such little things as this
that we disagreed."
MET AFTER FORTY YEARS
A Dying Man's Soul Cheered by
the Presence of an Old
Friend.
Captain Busbnell Meets James B.
Olcott for the First Time Since
Forty-Nine.
The sudden reappearance of an old-time
face and the reawakening of an old-time
friendship made Captain William E. Bush
nell of the Piedmont, though on a bed of
pain, forget the ravages of years and of
ill health in the joy of a meeting with
James B. Olcott, once mate of the Henry j
Lee, which brought him round the Horn
in the days of '49.
Bushnell was then a mere stripling on
his way to the land of gold in search of a
fortune. The mate was a young man of
fine presence and winsome ways, and he
took quite a liking to the manly youth in
quest of new and untried fields. The
journey in those days was a long one and
before its close liking grew into affection.
Then the parting came, and the hand of
destiny led each ot the friends in diverging
paths. The ocean trip would seem to have
given the boy a liking for salt water. He
began life in a humble way on the local
passenger vessels and when latterly
stricken down by sickness he had been in
command of several of the bay steamers.
Olcott, on the contrary, tired of the sea.
He engaged in other pursuits, and in time
became rme of the social, financial and sci
entific pillars of the town of Manchester,
Conn. At length the desire of seeing Cali
fornia again brought him to the port
which he first entered over forty years
aeo. He arrived a few days since, and his
first inquiry was fur tlie buy friend of Amis
gone by. He learned that Bushnell XPs
hovering betwiyt life and death. Haggl
ing to the sick man's bedside he greÂ«ed
the dying captain most affectionately.
The recognition was instantaneous on
both sides, and one or two who were pres
ent say a few glad tears were seen to fall,
of which neither the lusty traveler nor
the emaciated invalid appeared to be
ashamed.
The bay ferry captains appear to be
ratner unlucky. Besides Captain Bush
nell, who is suffering from an incurable
cancer, Captain Hughes is partially par
alyzed, being at present an inmate "of St.
Luke's Hospital, while rheumatism has
kept Captain Poole a prisoner in his house
for over a year.
As for Captain Bushruell, his old friends
seem to liave cheered him greatly. The
Southern Pacific Company, whose "trusted
officer he was, has also manifested much.
intereÂ«t in his condition, which is consid
ered almost if not totally beyond relief.
The Healy Inquiry.
A report comes from Washington to the ef
fect that the findings of the court-martial in
the case of Captain Healy have been approved
by the department, and that the former com
mander of the Bear will probably be trans,
ferred to another vessel.
