SPANISH FORCES
HAD TO RETREAT.
Fierce Encounter With the
Advance Guard of
Maceo.
RAKED BY A HOT FIRE
Regular Troops Suffered Great
Loss While Resisting the
Cubans' Charges.
OPENED A WAT WITH CANNON
Some of the Wounded Carried Away
Under the Shelter of the
Gunboat Alerta.
MADRID, Spain, April 14.â The Havana
correspondent of the Imparcial telegraphs
that the advance guard of Maceo's forces
have had an engagement near Lechuza
with the Alfonse XIII Battalion. The
Spaniards were compelled to fall back unon
their main body near San Claudio. The
troops lost four killed and fourteen
wounded.
Further details of the engagement show
that the Spanish column occupied two
hours in advancing from Mariel to the
point where it met the main body of the
insurgents. The retreat to the San Clau
dio estate, which is some distance west of
Mariel. occupied seven hours. On their
retreat the troops were exposed to a con
stant fire from the rebels in their rear, and
were frequently compelled to form squares
to resist the charges of the enemy. It was
necessary to use cannon to open a wav for
the retreat of the vanguard. The wounded
Spaniards were embarked upon a schooner
under the fire of the Alerta.
Accoraing to military authorities here
Colonel Sanchez Kchevarria, who had re
ceived orders to act in accordance with
Colonel Debus and General Inclan, failed
to arrive In time to assist the other two
bodies of Spanish troops. The authorities
say had they arrived in time Maceo's
force would have been badly whipped.
Colonel Ecbevarria has been relieved of
nis command and ordered to appear for
trial before a court-martial.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 14.â A band of
rebels attacked a number of laborers who
were employed in cutting sugar-cane on
the Constancis estate. The guerillas who
wore guarding the estate went to the aid
of the laborers and in the fighting that
ensued four of the guards and seven work
men were killed. Four men were
wounded. The rebel loss is unknown.
The colonel of the Luzon Battalion reports
an engagement between his command and
a rebel force between Rodriga and Aniaro,
in the province of Santa Clara. The rebel
loss, according to the report, was twenty
one killed, while only two troopers were
wounded.
VXOJ.AIEU neutrality LAWS.
John U. Hart Again Arrested in Connee-
lion With the Bermuda.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 14.â John
D. Hart, the steanfship owner of this city,
was arrested this afternoon on the charge
of violating the neutrality laws between
this country and Spain in connection with
the last voyage of the steamship Bermuda
and was given a preliminary hearing
before United States Commissioner Bell
ami bound over in $300 bail for a further
hearing to-morrow.
This is the second time Mr. Hart has
been arrested on the charge of filibuster
ing and it was only a day or so ago that he
was acquitted in New York on the first
charge.
Warrants of arrest are out for Captain
John O'Brien, master of the Bermuda;
Mates Murphy and Simonson and Colonel
Nunez, one of the local Cuban leaders,
and who was a passenger on board the
Bermuda on the last voyage.
Arrangements have been entered into
between counsel for the alleged filibusters
and the Government officers by which the
cases will be transferred from this United
States District to the United States
Court in New York. The information
upon which the warrants' were sworn out
was made by Jose Congosto, the Spanish
Consul at this port. Dr. Congosto is said
to have received the evidence upon which
he made the information from six or eight
of the seamen of the Bermuda, who are
said to be dissatisfied with the treatment
they received on the voyage. Mr. Hart's
hearing before Com missioned Bell to-day
was merely a preliminary one and no evi
dence was taken.
HORRIBLE DETAILS "FAKED."
How the Associated Press Grinds Out
Cuban News.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 13 (via Key West,
Fla., April 14). People of all shades ap
pear indignant over. the report of the gar
roting of five negro murderers, as sent out
by the Chicago Associated Press and
printed in papers which arrived from the
States yesterday. The report makes it ap
pear that Jive CuÃan patriots had been wan
tonly tortured to death by slow strangula
tion at the hands of a Spanish executioner
and a tale of horror is unfolded, the like
of which has not been witnessed in mod
ern times.
It is needless to state that no such story
was cabled irom here. The local agent of
the Chicago Associated Press at Havana is
an ex-lieutenant in the Spanish array and
is a good friend of Spain. He reported
briefly by cable that "Jive negro murder
ers, violators and incendiaries," had been
parroted and that the new executioner
made a bungling job in killing three of the
men and the old executioner dispatched
the other two victims without trouble.
From this a column account of the affair
was turned out by the Chicago news fac
tory.
The minutest details are given of the be
havior of the doomed men, one of whom
is made to confess while the others pray
for vengeance upon "those who had falsely
tent them to the scaffold." Ruiz, the exe
cutioner, is made to act as "he fumbled
The San Francisco Call.
and fumed, alternately turning to a death
like whiteness and Hushing crimson with
excitement." All of this is made out of
whole cloth. Ruiz, instead of "stumbling
away from the deatti-post and insisting
that his assistant finishes the day's work,"
turned to the new executioner after kil ling
two men and said: ''That is two ounces
you owe me." The Government pays an
ounce in Spanish "gold, or about $7, for
each man, and Ruiz wanted his share.
The United Press covered the actual facts
in the case in the following dispatch:
HAVANA, Cuba. March 31.â Five negroes
were garroted here to-day. They were not
rebels, but had been sentenced to death for
crimes committed prior to the breaking out of
the insurrection. The crimes were of the kind
that have resulted in negroes being burned at
the stake in the Southern States, and the exe
cution was not more bungling than many
hangings in the North.
The authorities at the palace were
amazed when they read the Chicago Asso
ciated Press story. They sent to the cable
office and obtained the original dispatch
as wired from here. This proved the
story to be a fake manufactured in the
United States and the local representative
of the alleged news association was saved
from decapitation. It will be remem
bered that the Chicago concern had Hav
ana captured by the rebels some three
months ago and Gomez dying from con
sumption four months ago; had Weylar
decide to resign one month ago, and had
buried Maceo and disbanded the insur
gents at frequent intervals for a year. The
next exploit is awaited with interest.
TOO MANY IN THE FAMILY.
Domestic Difficulties Culminate in Ex-Min
ister Turner Receiving a Frac
tured Skull.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April 14.â J. Milton
Turner, ex-Minister to Liberia, politician
and lawyer, is at the City Hospital with a
fractured skull. A fight with his step
daughter, Mrs. William Mason, Monday
night, is the cause.
There are two sides to the story. His
wife says: "It has been my custom. for
years to spread his meals in his room, no
matter what time he came home in the
morning. I was setting out his supper,
with which he expressed great dissatisfac
tion. My daughter heard him coming
into the room. She asked him to keep
still. He swore at her, telling her to mind
her own business. He told her to take the
children and get out of the house. She
said the children were in bed, and it was
too late at night to leave. He rushed at
her with a knife. Picking up a broken
pitcher from a shelf at her side, she hit
him over the head.''
Turner's story differs materially from
that told by his wife. He denies being
drunk. He told his stepdaughter to get
him something to eat, and a quarrel en
sued. During the excitement she hit him
on the head. Turner loudly bewails the
girl's ingratitude. He says he spent over
$10,000 on her education. Her husband
will not work, he says, and Turner sup
ports the whole family, including four
little girls. ' \. . . ; < ''i:u' : .
COUNTERFEIT POSTAGE STAMPS.
Hundred* Were Sent Through the Mail*
:> - * J y ' a* a Test.
CHICAGO, 111., April 14.â B. Peters,
an engraver, and John Volney, a litho
grapher and engraver, were arrested to
day by Captain Porter of the Federal
Secret Service on the charge of counter
feiting 2-cent stamps in large quantities
and selling them. A.J. Bodkin, whowas
manager for the Pauline Hoyt Formula
Company at 504 Van Buren street, is
charged with being a member ofthe gang.
Officers were unable to find him to-day.
The mails lately have been flooded with
hundreds of. letters with counterfeit
stamps on. The Hoyt concern- sent 600
such letters through this postoftice, it is
believed, as a test before the manufacture
and sale were conducted on a big scale
from the factory on Western avenue.
OBSTRUCTION'S ON' THE TRACK.
Removed Just in Time to Prevent a Train
Wreck.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 14.â The ex
press train due here at 4:30 th ; morning
on the Cleveland and Pittsburg road
would have been wrecked near the south
ern limits of the city but for the removal
of the obstructions placed there by the
would-be wreckers. A man on his way to
work saw several ties piled across and
parallel with the tracks, and he had only
just moved them when the train rushed
by at the rate of fifty miles an hour. -â
EARNEST SINGLE-TAXERS.
They Fail to Cause Miss Wil

the Question.
i
An Answer During a Church Lecture
That Caused the Audience
to Titter.
WILMINGTON, Dei.., April 14.-Four
workers connected with the committee in
charge of the Single Tax movement in this
city created a sensation in Grace. M. E.
Church this afternoon. Miss Frances E.
Willard, who came to this city for a fare
well lecture to Wilmington,* .was nearing
the close of her address when one of the
Single Taxers arose and requested per
mission to ask Miss Willard a question.
The latter thought the man wanted to
know if the collection had been taken, and
in answer to his request replied: "Yes,
the collection has been taken."
The single-taxer then sent a note to her
asking her opinion on single tax. Ad
dressing the audience Miss Willard -said
she had received several letters about the
single tax from a man in Wilmington and
said that she did not know much about
the matter. She said that she did not
think that it was the time or place to dis
cuss the question, as it had no connection
with the subject of her address. This re
mark caused the audience to titter. The
single-taxers walked from the church, and
after the meeting distributed single-tax
literature in the hallway.

BUFFALO, N. V., April 14.-The funeral
services of the late Bishop Ryan were held

bishop Ireland. The body was lowered

opinion, it would be considered by the
House at this session. He asked Powers if
he had any objection to notifying him
some time beforehand so that he might
prepare himself to oppose the bill on the
floor of the House. Powers replied that
he certainly had no objection to giving

the Mission.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 14.â
The city is all life to-night. At the Ar
lington, about which socle ty is centering,
the parlors are ablaze with illuminations
and in motion with the waltzers. On the
streets two or three bands are playing, and
thousands of persons are promenading.
The brilliant lights at the beautiful homes
for which Santa Barbara is famous show
that guests are , being everywhere enter
tained. The trains and stages have
brought a thousand men and women, most
of them tourists who during the winter
have remained in other parts of Southern
California, and in a place the size of this
1000 new comers make a showing. There
are 10,000 or 15,000 to come. Newspaper
men who dwell here and are shrewd ob
servers of the indications, assert in private
conversation that the attendance at this
festival of flowers will be greater than the
attendance in any previous year.
There was revelry to-day, out the resi
dents say that the real carnival will begin
to-morrow. The unique feature of the
Wednesday afternoon flower show in the
pavilion is to be the rosebud procession.
The word "rosebud" is used figuratively
in the programme, but it is also literal,
for the rosebud procession is to be a parade
of the Santa Barbara babies, and there are
many of these human rosebuds hereâ the
glory and the promise of the town. The
little people will travel in their carriages
and their carriages are to be richly dec
orated with rosesâ real buds, of course
but the babies will be the chief adornment.
At 1 o'clock to-morrow the battalion
band of the United States man-of-war
Philadelphia will give a concert at the
Arlington grounds. The rose show is to
begin at 2 o'clock. A promenade concert
will be the evening event.
The great feature to-day was the Country
Club reception, given in honor of Admiral
and Mrs.Beardslee, Captain and Mrs. Cot
ton and the subordinate officers of the
Philadelphia. The Country Club is a pow
erful social organization here. Dr. R. J.
Hall is its president. The other officers
are: C. B. Hale, secretary and treasurer;
Captain Walter Lord. C. C. Felton, Ronald
Thomas, George Gould, Dr. A. B. Thaw
and R. B. Fithian, directors. The club,
organized two years ago, has been highly
successful in the social line, but to-day's
event went far beyond any previous effort.
An object to the members was to make the
entertainment of the naval officers a
crowning event in its Hue of success, and
that was accomplished.
Nearly 1000 guests were in the spacious
reception-room. The battalion band gave
a concert on the lawn and the red of the
uniforms gave a contrast that enlivened
the outdoor portion of the scene. Nearly
all the Santa Barbara society people were
there.
The Country Club, which has a delight
ful home six miles down the shore in the
most beautiful part of Montecito, was or
ganized, in August, 1894. It has enter
tained many distinguished travelers, and
it has an important place in Santa Bar
bara social life.
â¢ State street, which is the main thorough
fare and extends from the wharf to the
elevated region of the Mission, was
crowded this morning with people who
congregated to witness the parade of the
naval battalion, 350 strong. At the con
clusion of the parade a drill was given in
the field opposite the Arlington. Lieu
tenant Ingersoll commanded the battal
ion.
Of course the ancient mission is hourly
invaded by hundreds and the padres have
the opportunity of the year to practice the
virtue of patience.
A large party went up the stage road to
San Marcos pass to-day in stages and on
horseback and from the mountain'ssum
mit looked upon the picturesque and
rugged Santa Ynez Valley. The whirling
along the edges of precipices was a thrill
ing experience to many of the tourists and
the story of it will often be told in their
Eastern homes. .. â¢ ! .'.. . -
The good old city is taking on its festival
week attire. The Thursday morning sun
will rise to look upon the annual marvel of
the Santa Barbara transformation. Thurs
day is to be the greatest day of the week,
with the procession, the battle of flowers
and the ball, but it is difficult for the
stranger to believe that there can be any
thing more delightful than the experience
that they have had while here.
BLOWN DOWN BY A STORM.
Seven Members of a Texas Family Severely
Injured by the Destruction of
, a House.
ABILENE, Tex., April 14.â News was
received here to-day that the house of J.
C. Hillion, living at Spring Creek, in the
southwestern extremity of the county,
was blown to pieces by the storm Satur
day night and seven out of ten members
of the family were severely injured. Three
of them were fatally hurt. They are Hil
lion's wife, her mother and the eldest
daughter, a girl of 16.
- The house and furniture were reduced
to splinters. The wreck immediately took
fire and two of the smaller children were
caught under the â¢ rubbish. The other
members of the family were unable to
rescue them -and they would certainly
have burned to death had not the flames
been extinguished by torrents of rain and
bail.

A LAD OF TWELVE
The Mysterious Persecutor
of the Smith Family
Captured,
PLANNED MANY DEATHS
For Months He Has Attempted
to Murder a Widow and
Her Children.
POISON PLACED IN THEIR FOOD.
Sought to Settle an 01. Feud Between
His Relatives and Their
Neighbors.
EUGENE, Or., April 14.â Oral Poindex
ter, a lad 12 years old, was arrested at his
home, four miles north of Coburg, yester
day, and was brought to this city this
afternoon on a charge of attempting to kill
the family of Mrs. Hiram Smith, a widow,
who lives on a farm adjoining that of the
Poindexters. The youth has made re
peated attempts to poison the Smiths, and
on several occasions has nearly succeeded.
An old feud has existed between the Poin
dexters and the Smiths, and it is believed
Oral felt that it devolved upon him to
settle the grudge by taking the lives of the
entire family.
For months Mrs. Smith and her chil
dren have been dwelling in constant fear
of death. When the family would be
away some mysterious person would visit
the house and scatter poison about, but it
seemed almost impossible to detect any
one. â¢ Several weeks ago the unknown
enemy left some kind of powder on the
top of the jars of milk. Mrs. Smith does
not know what the powder was, but be
lieves it was the kind of poison used to
destroy rats and squirrels. On this visit
the poisoner left two notes of a threaten
ing character. On the afternoon of the
next day he again visited the premises and
put another kind of powder on the cream
in the pantry. This substance was of a
whitish color, look like soda and tasted
like concentrated lye. On this visit an
other notice was left, as fellows:
The ones we want to kill is Hiram Smith,
L. Smith, Mary Smith, Clara Smith. I am
cqming: again. , This Is done by one you will
never know. God is building the fire for you
now. d you.
On the days that the notes and the
poison were left Mrs. Smith and her two
little girls were alone at the farm, the
young menâ Leel and Hiramâ being ab
sent on business. Judging from the tone
of the note it appeared that the unknown
desired to take the lives of the four orphan
children who live with Mrs. Smith.
About two weeks ago the family perse
cutor again gained admittance to the
premises unseen by any one and. scat
tered poison about the well and in water
ing-troughs and, in the . grain bin.
Thwarted thus far in his efforts to take the
lives of the family, the mysterious indi
vidual seemed determined to poison the
stock on the ranch. Since then several
other attempts were made by the poisoner,
and only by keeping their food and drink
under lock and key have the Smiths es
caped death. . ,
The officials having failed to trap the
fiend, S. 0. Garrison, a neighbor, was ap
pointed a special officer to investigate the
repeated outrages. He obtained .hi 3 first
clew Saturday. Mrs. Smith was away
from home, but one of the little girls was
left to keep watch. She saw young Poin
dextercome with a vial and pour some
thing into the pump. The next day, while
working about the chicken-house, she was
struck over the back of the head with a
club by Poindexter and was left uncon-
scious. Other evidence was secured against
the boy, until sufficient was had to war
rant his arrest. He is now held under $500
bonds. The boy is sullen and refuses to
talk.
Mrs. Smith is thÂ« widow of the lata
Hiram Smith, a man who was quite
wealthy and prominent in social and po
litical life. He owned large tracts of land
below Cobuig, and at one time was a can
didate for Congress. He has been dead
for number of years. Mrs. Smith is now
73- years old, and lives on a farm about
four miles below Coburg. She has no
children of her own, but adopted four
children who were orphaned by the death
of another adopted son.
As the first attempt to poison Mrs. Smith
was made ten years ago, it seems that
Poindexter was carrying on the dastardly
work begun by some other enemy of the
family. ' ' b^bb bb
FEARED HE WAS GROWING OLD.
So John Lehman Killed His Three Children

Suicide.
CHHICAGO, 111.. April John Leh
man, a driver for the Chicago and West

his three children, Clara aged 5, Bertha 3,

was fond of his, children, and while he
had over $1500 in the bank he was afraid
he would die and his little ones would not
be properly provided for. â¢ â¢ yy.'-
Mrs. Lehman at the time was at a flat

FOR A DEFENSE
OF THE RATION.
Senator Squire Speaks of
the Necessity of Better
Protection.
SEA COASTS EXPOSED.
Not in a Condition to Withstand
Attacks by the Navies of
Foreign Powers.
NO TIME TO CRY FOR WAR.
In the House the Bill Providing for
Improved Fortifications Is
Parsed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 14.â After
a speech in the Senate to-day by Squire of
Washington, in support of his bill making
large appropriations for seacoast defenses,
the rest of the session was taken up in the
consideration of the Delaware election
case, Chandler of New Hampshire arguing
at great length in favor of the claim of
Mr. Dupont to the vacant seat in the Sen
ate. The other side of the case is to be
sustained to-morrow by the Senator from
Delaware, Gray, who holds that Governor
Watson was entitled to cast his vote in the
Legislature as a State Senator and Speaker
of the Senate, and that having so voted
there was no majority for any candidate.
Gray intimated that his speech would
probably clos. the case on that side. Hoar
of Massachusetts gave notice, however, of
purpose to address the Senate in support
of Mr. Dupont' s claim, so that a decision
ot the question is not yet in sight.
The fact of Senator Morrill of Vermont
having attained his eighty-sixth birthday,
with more than half his life spent in Con
gress, was recalled to the Senate in the
chaplain's opening prayer, in which the
Senator was truthfully described a. hale
in body and clear, sound and vigorous in
intellect.
After some routine business, Squire (R.)
of Washington addressed the Senate on
the subject of tbe National defense. He
said:
"What an absurd spectacle has the Con
gress of the United States presented
during the present session by its persistent
talk in favor of the intervention by the
United States in behalf of Cuba and Vene
zuela. Every man who has informed him
self on the subject of National defenses
knows that as a nation we are not in con
dition to undertake war or suffer war.
Our courage and numbers would not avail
and it is folly to depend upon the resources
and inventions of the hour. The people
don't know how shamefully their interests
are being bandied and played with by
those who represent them in the halls of
Congress. They suppose in the simplicity
of their hearts that we are prepared to
protect ourselves in case of war with any
of the second or third class powers or even
against a first-rate power. They know
that the Nation has millions of brave and
patriotic men who would gather at the call
to arms. But they don't know that there
is no means of arming these hosts upon
the emergency that may arise. They
don't know that the great seacoast cities
through which extend the arteries of trade
and commerce with each other and with
the people of foreign landsâ populous
though these cities may be and teeming
with wealthâ yet exposed and defense
less against attack by foreign navies with
vessels far outnumbering ours in strength.
'â¢The bill presented by the Committee
on Coast Defenses is intended to meet the
wants of the Nation in this respect. It
has received the approval of the Secretary
of War and of the chiefs of the two great
departments of engineers and ordnance.
If it shall be adopted provision will be
made for the construction of the fortifica
tions necessary for the defense of the prin
cipal seacoast cities of the United States.
The aggregate number of direct fire high
power guns of all calibers required is 517;
the aggregate number of mortars is lOob";
for the construction of these guns* em
placement, and carnages about eight
years -till be required, and the sum of
at least $50,000,000. This sum cannot be
judiciously expended in a less time except
under great stress and at an additional
cost to the Government, and even in that
case it will be very difficult to complete
the armament in a much shorter period.
It is provided in the bill that the sum of
only $10,000,000 be appropriated for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, and
that an expenditure be authorized of
$10,000,000 for each -of the succeeding
seven fiscal years ending June 30, 1904.
Thus the tax wo;tld bo comparatively
light for each year, not equaling that
of the river and harbor bill, which
for the past ten years has averaged annu
ally between $13,000,000 and $14,000,000.
Think of it; $279,916,317 69 has been appro
priated since 1872 for the improvement of
rivers and harborsâ that is, for the benefit
of commerce â and yet we have been so
afflicted with 'coast defense blindness*
that we have expended only $10,000,000 or
$11,000,000 for the protection of ' these
harbors during the same period."

taken up at that hour to-day was called to
the attention of the Vice-Presidentâ Peffer
offering, however, to withhold the resolu
tion until Chandler should have finished
his speech. In referenca to that offer
Gray (D.) of Delaware said that the ar
rangement was that he should follow
Chandler, and he added that that would
probably close the debate on that side of
the question.
Cullom (R.) of Illinois made a sugges
tion as to not interfering with appropria
tion bills, but Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada
remarked that before all the appropria
tion bills were passed it was necessary to
know how much money there was on
hand.
"The Senator need not worry about the
money getting out of the treasury," said
Cullom. "It is going out pretty fast. The
trouble is that it does not come in fast
enough." ->Â b
"My dear sir, listen to what I have to
say," Stewart interposed. "With $300,
--000,000 in the treasury taKen out of circu
lation, the country feels the pressure of a
want of money if the Senator from Illinois
does not."
"The Senator from Illinois," said Cul
lotn, "has always felt the want of money.''
"If the bond resolution is up," Hill (D.)
of New York broke in, "I want to take a
hand in it myself." [Laughter.]
After further colloquy on these lines, it
was agreed that the Peffer resolution for
an investigation into the recent bond
issues should be taken up after Gray shall
have replied to Chandler's speech.
Then Chandler proceeded with his argu
ment, which he addressed especially, he
said, to his three judges, who sat near
him, the Populist Senators, Allen of Ne
brasica, Peffer of Kansas and Stewart of
Nevada. (This intimation oi the quarter
from which the decision of the question is
to come created a ripple oi laughter all
around the chamber.) He closed at 4:30
o'clock, when Gray (D.) Of Delaware took
the floor, but reserved his argument
against Dupont's right till to-morrow.
The following bills were taken from the
calendar and passed:
Senate bill relieving the personal repre
sentatives of John Sherman Jr., late United
States Marshal in New Mexico.
Senate bill for the relief of the estate of
Ramsay Crooks, appropriating $9719.
The Senate at 5 p. m. adjourned until
to-morrow.
DONE WITHOUT DIVISION.
Passage of the Bill Making Appropria
tions for Fortifications.
WASHINGTON, D. C.. April I.4.â The
House to-day passed without division and
practically without objection the bill
making appropriations for fortifications
and coast defenses. Its passage was ad
vocated by Hainer (R.) of Nebraska,
Sayers (D.) of Texas, Bartlett (D.) of New-
York, Livingston (D.) of Georgia, Hemen
way (R.) of Indiana and Cannon (R.) of
Illinois, all members of the Committee on
Appropriations, and by Baker (R.) of New-
Hampshire. The latter criticized the com
mittee for not going further and appro
priating all the money asked by Generals
Flagler and Craighill.
Berry (D.) of Kentucky w T as the only
opponent of the bill. He said the money
would be better spent in building ships
than in fixing batteries.
The Secretary of War estimated that
$8,045,153 could be expended in the coming
year. The bill carries specific appropria
tions, amounting to $5,842,337, and au
thority is given to the Secretary of War to
make contracts involving the further ex
penditure of $5,542,276. making the total
authorized expenditures in the bill $11,
--384.613.
The following shows the aggregate
amount appropriated and authorized by
contract under each subdivision of the
bill, namely: Gun and mortar batteries,
$5,260,000; sites for fortifications, $250,000;
plans lor fortifications, $5000; seawalls
and embankments, $17,977; torpedoes for
harbor defense, $100,000; armament of
fortifications, $5,502,673; proving eround,
Sandy Hook, N. J., $38,0C0; Watertown,
Mass., $3500; Watervleit Arsenal, N. V.,
$3105; Benicia Arsenal, Cal., $4500; ord
nance and fortifications board, $100,000;
Fortress Monroe sewerage system, $9860.
The House agreed to the conference re
port upon the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill as far as the
conferees had agreed, and ordered another
conference upon the matters still in dis
pute between the two houses.
Bingham (It.) of Pennsylvania reported
from the conferees on the legislative, ex
ecutive and judicial appropriation bill, the
agreement made leaving the two houses
still apart on something over 100 of the
314 amendments made by the Senate.
Bingham explained the grounds of differ
ence substantially as stated by Senator
Cullom in the Senate yesterday. The
total amount involved in the differences
was $189,590.
'Considerable discussion occurred over
the amendment included in the disagree
ment which provided for additional Sen
ate employes. bbb
Hartman (R.) of Montana moved to in
struct the House conferees to recede from
their disagreement and agree to it with an
; amendment providing annual clerks to
members of the House, but it was ruled
out on a point of order.
The report of the conference was agreed
to and a further conference on the dis
puted points ordered.
The debate was continued by Sayers
(D.) of Texas and Bartlett (D.) of New
York, who advocated the passage of the
bill. The whole people, irrespective of
party, Bartlett contended, demand the
adoption and execution of a just system of
coast defense.
Proceeding to details, Bartlett said the
plan recommended for execution contem
plated the execution of about $90,000,000.
It would necessitate the purchase of 203
12-inch steel guns, 190 10-inch guns and
ninety-eight 8-inch guns. He exhibited
engravings of the guns as mounted in the
fortifications.
in closing Bartlett quoted from the
words of Tilden, whom he described as
"A distinguished Democrat and at one
time President of the United States."
This evoked laughter and groans from the
Republicans, and Hardy of Indiana asked
"Did he draw his salary?"
"No," answered Bartlett with delibera
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 1896.
tion, as he wiped his glasses, "he did not
draw his salary, but he did receive a ma
jority of the fair votes of the country and
that I believe is now conceded by every
body except the gentleman from Indiana."
Several gentlemen desired to ask Bart
lett questions, but he declined to yield,
saying he did not wish to be drawn into a
political discussion.
Livingston (D.) of Georgia, also a mem
ber of the Committee on Appropriations,
and supporting the bill, said it might
seem strange to persons on the outside
that the House should jump from an ap
propriation of $2,000,000 in one session to
$11,000,000 in the next. But he wanted to
congratulate people on the inside and out
side that this appropriation was to be
made at a time when it was apparent that
Mr. McKinley of Ohio would be the Re
publican nominee for President; that the
A. P. A.'s would beat him; that 'the pure
Jeffersonian Democracy would take charge
of the Chicago convention, and that there
fore they could sleep comfortably, know
ing that money would be economically
spent and that the country would be safe
after the 4th of March next. [Laughter.l
The bill has been prepared in accordance
with the suggestion of General Flagler, he
said, and if the committee had made a
mistake it was because it has been misled
by those who ought to be informed on the
subject.
Walsh (D.) of New York asked if Living
ston was aware of the fact that forty-five
rapid-fire guns had been sent by the Brit
ish military authorities to Kingston for
defense of the lakes?
Livingstonâ lt would not make any dif
ference, Mr. Chairman, if there were 145.
I know that we could take Canada in three
weeks without regard to the number of
guns or the number of men that could be
assembled within that time for her de
fense. [Applause.] Mr. Chairman, I hope
the bill will pass-
Baker (R.) of New Hampshire ex
pressed his gratification that the bill was
so much better than those of preceding
Congresses, and regretted that the com
mittee had not gone further and risen to
the full height of the opportunity pre
sented.
The action of the committee was warmly
defended by Hemenway (R.) of Indiana
and Cannon (R.) of Illinois. They stated
that the committee had recommended an
approriation of all the money that could
be expended for fortifications in the year
and authorized contracts for additional
work, money for which would be provided
in the coming session of Congress.
Cannon emphasized the statement made
by Hainer that this bill would do as much
work as had been accomplished by all the
fortification appropriation bills passed
since I^B2. The only opposition to the
bill came from Berry (D.) of Kentucky,
who said that the expenditure of money
would be more profitable if it were put
into the construction of the best type of
battle-ships and coast-defense vessels,
which could be assembled at any point
threatened by a foreign foe, instead of for
fixed batteries.
The bill was read and without amend
ment was reported to the House and
passed without a division.
At 4:25 o'clock, oh motion of Hainer,
the House adjourned until to-morrow.
SWARMS OF IMMIGRANTS
Ellis Island Crowded by the
Horde of Pauper For
eigners.
Hundreds Who Clamor for a Landing
Will Probably Be De.
ported.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 14.â Ellis
Island is crowded by the advance guard of
the invading horde of pauper Italian im
migrants. Right on top of the swarm of
nearly 1400 unloaded from the Bolivia
there came yesterday another hungry con
tingent of 1500 landed from the steamer
Alesia from Mediterranean ports and the
Albano from Hamburg, and Havre. Of
these all but a few were Italians.
The immigration authorities are fairly
appalled, and realize that no steps mnst
be neglected to check the influx. On the
island the immigration authorities, were
driven almost frantic in their efforts to
control the clamorous horde of aliens, who
fairly fought to be permitted to land, and
the not less persistent mob of friends who
sought to obtain their release.
That term "friend" more frequently, is
used as a cloak by tbepadrones and immi
gration agents, who are ready to pose as
brothers or cousins in order to secure the
release of immigrants consigned to them,
who might otherwise be debarred from
landing. Such friends were in the major
ity yesterday, for it was known that among
the Bolivia's passengers were 260 of the
'barred" class, who, unless rescued, were
subject to deportation. In addition to
these there are 542 passengers under de
tention until their claims can be passed
upon. -yyY. <â¢_
Many of the passengers by the Alesia
swelled the number of. the "barred," which
rose to 520, or about one in every six of
of those arriving during the two days.
This will be further increased to-morrow,
when another steamer arrives with about
1500 immigrants. Ellis Island presents a
scene of extraordinary activity, all avail
able space being covered with a mass of
immigrants awaiting their turn to present
themselves before the examiners.

The Democrats of Missouri
Gather at Sedalia for
the Convention.
A SPIRITED CANVASS
Leaders Preparing to Do Battle
Against the Policy of
Gold Bugs.
THERE IS A PROMISE OF STRIFE
Serious Trouble Expected in the Se
lection of the National Dele
gates.
SEDALIA, Mo., April 14.â Incoming
trains to-day brought the advance guard
of the Democratic State Convention to be
held here to-morrow. The executive
committee met this afternoon and, after
a spirited canvass between Colonel W. H.
Hatch and Hon. M. F. Benton, the former
was selected temporary chairman by a
vote of 16 to 13. Senator U. F. Cochran of
Buchanan County is favorably mentioned
for permanent chairman.
Nearly all the prominent leaders of the
silverites and gold bugs reached here this
morning, and some of the liveliest hust
ling ever witnessed in a Missouri campaign
is being carried on. Among those active
in the button-holing of delegates and the
manipulation of modern conduit systems
are Governor Stone, Hon. Richard P.
Bland, Colonel William Phelps. Colonel
Nicholas M. Bell, Secretary of State
Leseur, Auditor Seibert, George W. Allen,
Chairman Maffitt and ex-Congressman
Heard.
It is admitted to-night that the silver
men will practically control the conven
tion, and unless they are inclined to be
magnanimous and adhere to the time
honored traditions of Democratic State
conventions there will be serious trouble
over the selection of National delegates.
Ik is conceded that Governor Stone, ex-
Congressman Bland and Senators Vest
and Cockrell will be selected as the dele
gates-at-large to the Chicago convention.
The Sedalia convention will promulgate
a financial platform which it is intended
shall be the money plank in the National
platform as adopted in Chicago. This is
not all. The Missouri silverites will go to
Chicago with the belief that they and.their
fellow delegates from the Western and
Southern States are strong enough to
dominate and control the National con
vention. To support this claim they will
present two pieces of Presidential timber,
namely, Governor Stone and "Silver Dick"
Bland.
In case their attempts to control the con
vention are frustrated they will hold in
reserve the threat {hat they will cast the
solid vote of the Missouri delegation, ac
companied by that of several other neigh
boring States, for ex-Governor Boies of
lowa, as the Democratic standard-bearer
in the coming campaign. Some enthusiasts
even go so far as to predict that Governor
Stone of Missouri will be chairman of the
National Committee on Platform and will
make the principal speech in favor of its
adoption. y';'v
Late to-night the cry of "no quarter" is
being sounded throughout the city, and it
is given out that the mandate of the people
of Missouri must be obeyed, and nothing
less than a solid free silver delegation
from this State shall be sent to Chicago.
REPUBLICANS OF NEBRASKA.
They Will Declare for McKinley and
Sound Money.
OMAHA, Nebr., April 14.â The Republi
can State Delegate convention will be
called to order to-morrow evening at 7:30
o'clock, but prior to that time all the pre
liminary work of selecting committees and
choosing a temporary chairman will have
been accomplished. The presentation of
the names of these committees will there
fore be a mere formality.
The city is alive with politicians, dele
gates to the convention and candidates for
office. .Congressman Hainer, chairman of
the State Central Committee, cannot be
present, and the duty of calling the con
vention to order will fall upon Vice-Chair
man J. J. Mallalu. W. P. McCreary of
Hastings has been spoken of for. tempor
ary chairman, and Dr. G. W. Collins of
Pawnee City hag a following. The chances
are in favor of McCreary.
The election of delegates will be little
more than a formality, at least so far as
three of them are concerned. John L.
Webster of Omaha, T. B. Kennard of Lin
coln and Peter Jensen of Jefferson City
will be chosen by acclamation. Interest
in the matter was increased this morning
by the announcement that George H.
Thummell of Grand Island would contest
for the honor of being the fourth member
of the State delegation.
The consensus of opinion by those con
sulted on the matter seems to be that the
committee will not go very heavily into
platform making. It is thought McKin
ley will be indorsed promptly, and that
the money question will be touched on in
McKinley 's words: "The money should
be as sound as the Government and as un
tarnished as its honor." _;--__

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., April Chair
man Gowdy of the Republican State Com
mittee which met here to-day has come
out squarely for McKinley. He says: "I
am for McKinley. As chairman of the
State committee I believe I have the right
to be for whom I please. I have had the
best facilities for ascertaining what the
sentiment of the party in this State is and
I believe that 90 per cent of the Republi
cans of Indiana are demanding the nom
ination of McKinley. I have not only
written letters to my friends throughout
the State advocating McKinley, but I have
openly advised that the State convention
ought to instruct the delegates at large to
vote for him, not first, last and all the
time, as some of the newspapers have said,
but as long as there is a reasonable chance
for his nomination."

Colorado Democrats .Solid for the White

DENVER, Colo., April 14.â The State
i Democratic Convention will meet to-mor
row in the Broadway Theater. There will
be 463 delegates in the convention. Arapa
hoe County will have ninety-one delegates
representing the county. The leaders have
not yet decided who will be chairman of
the convention. -
Charles S.Thomas and T. J. O'Donneil
will probably go as delegates-at-large to
the National convention at Chicago.
Other delegates are uncertain owing to
divided interests. As the Arapahoe
County Convention held to-day seems a
solid delegation to the State convention,
bound by the Senate rule to fight the
Cleveland wing of the party, the contest
between the administrationists and the
silverites will not be as interesting as was
anticipated.
The presence of Senator Tillman will
aid the silver Democrats materially, and a
silver delegation of fighting strength will
go to Chicago. y ;
CHAIRMAN UARRITT'S VIEWS.
Say* th* Sound-Money Democrat* Should
Organize Everywhere.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 14.-In ;
speaking to-day of the political situation
in the Democratic party, National Chair
man Harritysaid:
"I certainly do not agree with those who
expect that there will be two Democratic
National Conventions or a bolt from the
regular Democratic National Convention.
I recognize and appreciate the fact that
the free-silver element of the Democratic
party, up to the present time, is more ag
gressive than the sound-money men of
that organization. The free-silver men are
systematically and energetically at work
with a view to electing delegates and dele
gations who will favor the free, unlimited
and independent coinage of silver.
"It is generally believed that in the
States in which the free-silver element of
the party prevails and in the majority, the
unit rule will be adopted, in order that the
States in question may prove as effective
as possible in the interest of free silver.
This will apply to the adoption of a plat
form as well as the nomination of the
candidates. As you know, a majority of;
the convention has the power to make the ;
platform, but it will take two- thirds of the
convention to nominate its candidates.
"I can only repeat what I have hereto
fore said, that while I still believe that the
sound-money element of the Democratic
party will be in control of the Chicago
convention, yet what now seems likely to
be a majority may easily become a minor
ity by reason of the supineness or neglect
of the sound-money men of the party.
"I would say to the sound-money Dem
ocrats of the country, organize, organize
everywhere if they want to adopt a plat
form and nominate candidates who will be
for the best interests of the country and
conducive to the permanent welfare of the
Democratic party."
BRADLEY IN THE LEAD.
Ahead of McKinley in the Struggle in
Kentucky.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 14.â Governor
Bradley to-night leads in the contest for
the Republican instructions for President,
but there is such a strong sentiment in
favor of McKinley that there is no telling
who will win out. Bradley had the better
organization, and won the instructions in
the majority of the district conventions.
The big fight is going to be on temporary
organization, and as there are enough con
tests to sway the result, a lively battle is
promised.
The district conventions, six of which
were held to-day, instruced as follows:
First, Bradley; Second, Bradley; Third,
McKinley; Fourth, Bradley; Fifth, Mc-
Kinley; Sixth, McKinley; Seventh, Mc-
Kinley; Eighth, Bradley first, McKinley
second; Ninth, McKinley; Tenth, 1 Brad
ley first, McKinley second; Eleventh,
Bradley. â¢
The State convention will meet in this
city at 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon. The
Fifth or Louisville District will cause
trouble by reason of the bolt of the A. P.
As., who are solid for Bradley, he being a
member of the organization. Governor
Bradley is his own manager, while Mayor
George Todd is representing McKinley.
VICIOUS FIGHT ON McKINLEI.
The A. P. A. Men Will Leave No Stone
Unturned to Defeat Him.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 14. â The
American Protective Associatian is mak
ing a vicious fight on McKinley. Judge
J. H. I. Stevens of Missouri, chairman of
the National Advisory Board, is here di
recting the battle, and to-night it is an
nounced that C. E.Sapp, a McKinley dele
gate from this city to St. Louis, will bolt
his instructions and vote for Bradley. He
is State president of the A. P. A. The
A. P. A. leaders had a long consultation
to-day with Bradley and several members
of the State Central Committee.
The A. P. A. announced that they were
going to use all the influence possible to
secure the indorsement by the convention
of Bradley's candidacy, and the claim was
made that they had already organized a
Democratic branch in this city with 1500
members. The Republican members of
the order, it is stated, have received in
structions to scratch McKinley to a finish
if he is nominated. -^bb

SAT UP IN THE COFFIN
After Being Laid Out for Burial
Clara Hoppenstall Came
to Life.
Her Su.dea Vitality Scared a
Neighbor Into Complete Un
consciousness.
FREEHOLD, N. J., April 14.â While the
friends of Clara Hoppenstall were gathered
at her home on Saturday night talking of
her life, and her death on the day before,
they were startled by a shriek coming
from the room where the body had been
laid out.
Several men present rushed to the room,
but the sight that met their gaze terrified
them. Sitting upright in her white robe
was the supposed corpse, with wide open
eyes staring straight ahead. On the floor
was Charles Burton, a neighbor, in a dead
faint. The lips of the supposed corpse be
gan to move, and then she fell back to her
bier.
The frenzied men plucked up courage
enough to go to the assistance of Burton,
and a doctor was hastily summoned.
When the physician arrived Burton had
recovered his senses and the doctor ex
amined Miss Hoppenstall. He announced
that there was life and that the case was
one of suspended animation.
He applied remedies, and soon the
woman was resting quietly and breathing
naturally. She sleeps all ' ttie time, but
yesterday her vitality was sinking rapidly
away. Her physician does not think her
recovery probable, though it is possible.
Miss Hoppenstall had all the appear
ance of being dead for more than thirty
four hours. She had typhoid fever and a
complication of other diseases. The
funeral was to have taken place yesterday.
Mr. Burton stated that he went to the
room to saturate a cloth that was over the
eyes of the supposed corpse to prevent dis
coloration. He noticed nothing peculiar
about the body, and was about leaving the
room when he saw Miss Hoppenstall sit
ting up with her eyes wide open and star
ing at him. He did not remember any
thing further until found by those who
came in respone to his shriek.

HUDYAN.
SORE SPOTS. \
If your body is .partially covered with
sores which itch badly, or which run con.i
tinually, or are bard to heal; or if youri
hair is beginning to fall out; if your teeth I
are loose or are loosening, you may be as- I
sured that your blood is in a very impure
state. These symptoms frequently follow
the contraction of diseases of a private na-
ture, and they may be due too to a parent
or nurse who had some affliction. "HUD-
YAN" the KING cures all these ailments
promptly and permanently. It is a purely
vegetable compound, but strong and cer-
tain in its action. It was discovered by
the physicians of the great and grand

The famous establishment where all cur-
able diseases are cured quickly and surely.
WEAK KNEES.
If you have been foolish enough to give
way to temptation in your youth and you
are beginning to feel the effects now,
either by having lost your manhood or
perhaps through nightly emissions, which
will soon bring on this dread disease, you
must lose no time in seeking complete
restoration of your vital powers. If you
would become "every inch a man" again
nothing equals "HUDYAN," the KING
jof all specifics. It will restore your vital-
I ity, bring back your strength, will power

{ and nervous men full of confidence, life
â¢ and action. It can only be obtained,

AND A FIGHT.
Bloody Sequel to a Little
Romance of Sunny-
Italy.
TWO MEN ARE STABBED
And a Third Who Took Part in
the Fray is Shot in
the Heart.
ONE ACTS AS THE EEFEREE.
But He Is the First to Receive the
Vengeance of One of the
Belligerents.
BROOKLYN, N. V., April 14.â A free
fight among four Italians at a pier near
Hamilton Ferry to-night resulted in two
men being stabbed and one shot in the
heart. Three are in the hospital with
little chance of recovery. The principals
were Salvator Grinaldi and his brother,
Caimo Grinaldi, Salvator Pasquale and
Martin Gentelo. The latter lives in Bos
ton, while the Grinaldi brothers reside in
this city.
The row began owing to the elopement
between Salvator Grinaldi and the IS-year
old sister of Gentelo, who left Naples
about six months ago.
The young couple came to Brooklyn,
and Gentelo was instructed by his parents
to hunt them up. He found them in a
house on President street to-night. He
wanted to fight.
The brothers consented, and took Pas
quale along as referee, and after fighting
some time Gentelo drew a knife eight
inches long and stabbed the referee ten
times in the body. He next attacked
Caimo Grinaldi, and succeeded in cutting
him in the arm twice. Grinaldi drew a
pistol and fired two shots. One of the bul
lets struck Gentelo in the heart, ending the
fight. It is thought Pasquale will also
die.
TOYING WITH TICKETS
General Managers Determined to
Enforce the Restrictive
Conditions.
Provisions Adopted That May Some
what Impede the Business
of Sca'pers.
CHICAGO, lit.., April 14.â The general
managers of Western railroads reached an
agreement at an adjourned meeting to-day
with reference to the mileage ticket ques
tion. It was in line with the action of the
general passenger agents at their recent
St. Louis meeting as to the enforcement of
the restrictive conditions of such tickets.
On and after May 1 the 2000-mile ticket,
which is sold for $50, cannot be used ex
cept when the conditions of purchase have
been complied with. It is non-transfera
ble, and the conductors will take it up if
they believe it is presented by any person
other than the original purchaser.
The non-transferable restriction will be
practically enforced by a provision that
the refund of $10 on each ticket now made
by agents of each road independently
shall be made through the chairman of
the Western Passenger Association or his
agents at the principal points in the terri
tory. The refund will be refused if the
â¢cent thinks a scalper or his agent is the
holder of the ticket. As the mileage
tickets represent the stock in trade of the
ecalper and the refund of $10 is usually his
profit on each book, this action of the
Western roads will be a body blow at their
business.
Two or three of the Western roads at the
general managers' meeting yesterday did
not feel disposed to vote for the complete
extinction of party rates in territory east
of the .Missouri, but their votes were re
corded in the affirmative at to-day's meet
ing. All the roads felt that they ought to
make reduced rates for theatrical and such
parties, and to show their, friendly senti
ment they named a special committee to
see if some means could not be devised
whereby such parties could be legally and
protectively given a reduced rate.
The managers adjourned till next Tues
day, when the details of the new mileage
ticket agreement will be attended to.
OLIVE WREATHS FOR WINNERS.
Those Who Captured Prizes at Athens Will
Be Honored in the Ancient
Manner.
ATHENS, Greece, April 14.- It was in
tended to distribute to-day to the winners
tne prizes won in the Olympic games, but
the weather was so bad that the distribu
tion was postponed, so that all those who
desired could be present to see the honors
awarded to the victors. The prizes will
be wreaths made from the leaves and
twigs of wild olive trees growing in
Olympia, thus following the precedents in
the ancient games. It was at one time
proposed to substitute silver wreaths, but
this plan was abandoned, it being thought
far more appropriate to give the olive
wreaths that centuries ago conferred such
honor and distinction UDon the victors in
the Olympic games. In addition to the
wreatns each winner will receive a medal
and a handsomely illustrated diploma.

BOSTON, Mass., April 14â Ives and
Daly were down to show Bostonians the
cushion game to-night, and 500 spectators
paid admission to Bumstead Hall to see
their dexterity. Ives broke the record with
a run of 85 and won. He gave a display of

asm knew no bounds. The applause when
Ives passed the half-hundred mark was
tremendous, and the silence when he

considering the bill at this session, and he
is supposed to reflect the views of Reed.
The Capitol corridors are infested with
Huntington's agents every day. Hunting
ton himself goes to the Capitol to direct
their efforts. Among them are: Tweed of
New York, ex-Congressman Payson of
Illinois, ex-Congressman Phil Thompson
of Kentucky, Winslow S. Pierce of the
Union Pacific, ex-Representative Cadmus
of New Jersey, Corthell of New York, the
Southern Pacific engineer; an ex-Repre
sentative from Nevada, John Boyd, and
others who are working less conspicu
ously.
It is a noteworthy fact that Powers,
chairman of the Pacific Railroads Com
mittee, represented California on that
committee when it voted to report the
funding bill. Grove L. Johnson was ab
sent, but he authorized Powers to vote him
for the bill.
Kyle of Mississippi, who was absent yes
terday when the committee agreed to re
port the bill, will join with Hubbard of
Missouri and Bell of Texas in a minority
report; but he will not go so far as to
favor the bill which Maguire will propose
as a substitute. Hubbard is now engaged
in preparing his minority report, but will
not present it until the majority report is
submitted by Chairman Powers.
Corthell of New York, Huntington's
railroad engineer, is here to try to convince
the Senate Committee on Commerce that
the Santa Monica harbor should be im
proved. It was Engineer Corthell who,
with Engineer Hood, reported that Santa
Monica wis much better adapted for a
deep-water harbor than San Pedro. Hunt
ington is mating determined efforts to get
the $3,000,000 (continuous contract) item),
stricken out by the House side, inserted
by the Senate Commerce Committee.
Senator Frye, the chairman, is using his
best endeavors to assist his friend, and be
wields considerable influence both in that
committee and in the Senate.
Senator White of California is a mem
ber of the committee, and his attitude is
in some doubt. His colleagues declare
that he will oppose Santa Monica, even'
though San Pedro suffers by it, but John
Boyd said to Ihe Call correspondent to
night that he believed White would not
oppose the Santa Monica project if the ap
propriation for San Pedro was endangered
thereby.
A delegation of ten from Los Angeles
will arrive here to-morrow night or Thurs
day morning. Five are understood to be
for Santa Monica and five for San Pedro.
A merry time is expected when they begin
their fight.
Maguire proposes to make a speech in
the House denouncing the Santa Monica
job. ' : "-yyyiy

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 1896.
STOCKTON BANKS
MUST ANSWER
Assessor Ortman's Demand
for Cash Accounts Is
Sustained.
GOVERNOR BUDD ACTS.
Tardy Commissioners Ordered
to Secure the Information
Desired.
TOLD TO DO THEIR DUTY.
If False Returns Have Been Made,
the Money-Lenders Will Be
Taxed Twelvefold.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 14.â County
Assessor Ortman is after the banks with a
sharp stick. Recently he asked the State
Board of Equalization to request the Bank
Commissioners to have the banks here fur
nish him with a statement of the amount
of coin on hand on the first Monday in
March. This Mr. Morehouse of the State
Board of Equalization did, and it was
thought that at last the Assessor could
assess the banks with some knowledge of
what they had on hand. Heretofore the
blanks have been left in the banks and the
bankers filled them out to suit themselves,
and their returns were never questioned.
Now Ortman is satisfied that the returns
are not correct, and wants to get some
way of ascertaining whether he is right or
not.
Instead of complying with the request
made by Morehouse the Bank Commis
sioners notified the banks to submit a state
ment of what they had on hand on March
28. That is not what Ortman wanted,
so he went to Governor Budd on Friday
and asked him to request the Commission
ers to direct the banks to furnish the in
formation wanted. This Governor Budd
did, putting it in such a way that the Com
missioners could comply with the request
very gracefully. If they do not, Governor
Budd says, he will see that they do. In
speaking of the matter to-day Ortman
said:
"I think the Bank Commissioners are
trying to shirk their duty. The Governor
says that he believes the rich should pay
their taxes as well as the poor a/id that he
will do all he can to see that they do. If
the Bank Commissioners will not do what
we ask he will endeavor to compel them to
have the banks furnish the statements we
want. The Governor came to the rescue,
and if we are able to get at the amount of
money in the banks all over the State it
will increase the tax roll millions of dol
lars. If the Bank Commissioners compel
the banks to furnish us with a statement
when requested the Grand Jury can haul
an assessor over the coals when he fails to
compel the banks to pay taxes on the
amounts they should.
"I wish you would say for me," con
tinued Ortman, "that the law allows me
to assess at twelve times the amount
turned in in cases where such amounts
have been willfully falsified. Not only will
I increase the assessment ten times in case
I find a man deliberately giving an incor
rect statement, but I will have the man
who makes it brought up before the Grand
Jury." .
CALIFORNIA EDITORS.
Semi- Annual Meeting of the Pres* Asso

SACRAMENTO, Cal.. April 14.-The
semi-annual meeting of the California
Press Association was held here to-night
and was largely attended by publishers

THE AHWAHNEE TRAGEDY.
Richard McGcon Confesses to the
Killing of William
McGuirk.
C aims in Justification That the Water
in His Well Had Been Poisoned
by the Rancher.
MADERA, Cal., April 14.â Sheriff West
fall and Coroner Payne returned late last
night from Ahwahnee, bringing with
them Richard McGoon, who shot and
killed William McGuirk on Saturday last
at that place. The verdict of the Coro
ner's jury was that the deceased came to
his death by reason of gunshot wounds
inflicted by McGoon. '
William Metcalf, who was the principal
witness at the inquest, said that on Satur
day afternoon while he was at the Crooks
ranch he saw McGoon coming from the
direction of his cabin. â  When he arrived
at the bouse he told ; Metcalf that he had
shot McGuirK and that he wanted him to
go up to where his body lay and have it
cared for. Metcalf, in company with one
of the ranch hands, started out for the
scene of the snooting. When they ar
rived at McGoon's place they found Mc-
Guirk's body lying in front of the door of
the cabin. One charge of buckshot had
struck the man in the shoulder and an
other had taken effect in the side of his
head. y'-Y-.r-
McGoon surrendered to Constable Lara
more, who took him to Fresno Flats for
his preliminary examination. Coroner
Payne swore to a complaint, charging Mc-
Goon with murder, and filed it before
Judge Johnson, who, after informing the
defendant of his rights, asked him if he
was ready to â¢ plead to the charge. The
prisoner answered : "I guess lam guilty ;
I done the shooting all right, and there is
not much use in fooling about it."
Judge Johnson then made out a com
mitment holding him to answer before
the Superior Court without bonds. Mc-
Goon stated as his reason for killing Mc-
Guirk that some time ago he had over
heard McGuirk and another person in con
versation, in which they were laying their
plans to poison him; that McGuirk had j
poisoned his spring the night before the
shooting, and he had nearly died from the
effects of the poisoned water on Saturday
morning. . * r o-.'-',
"We were both mad," said McGoon,
"and I told him to go away and go home.
He saw me cock both -barrels of the gun,
but instead of going away he started to get
off his horse and then' I fired at him. He
fell, and I fired the other barrel at him to
finish the job."
TRAIN'S INTO RIVERSIDE.
Valuable Concession Granted to â  the
Southern Pacific.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., April 14. âAt a
meeting of the City Council to-day an
oidinance was passed which grants the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company valu
able franchise rights within the corporate
limits. Some time ago the company
bought the old motor road running be
tween this city and San Bernardino, and
soon after the "purchase applied for a mod
ification of the franchise held by the motor
company, asking that it be allowed to use
large locomotives instead of small motor
engines. The body to-day granted this re
quest, and the Southern Pacific will here
after run trains into the heart of the city.
The concession is a valuable one and
places the Santa Fe at a disadvantage, as
that company's depot is a half mile from
the city center.
UKIAH BANDIT ON TRIAZ.
John Schneider Arraigned for the Al

ment for the people, after which the wit
nesses subpenaed in the case were placed

the court-room. ...
Twenty-two witnesses were subpenaed on
behalf ot the prosecution, and eight by the
defense. The testimony this afternoon
was unimportant.

County Infirmary this evening. Word
comes from Capay to-night that the
younger of the Stevens boys, who were
suspected of having shot the old man, had
confessed that the elder brother fired the
fatal shot. A report is also current that
other persons were implicated in the mur
der; that they were desirous of purchasing
Maxwell's ranch, but were unable to reach
satisfactory terms, and that the Stevens
boys were hired by them to do away with
him.
Maxwell was shot while at work in his
garden. The weapon used was a shotgun,
and at least twenty-rive No. 4 shot took
effect in the right side of his face and
head. At the hospital he told the follow
ing story:
"Two boys named Stevens came up to
my cabin and I gave them dinner. They
told me their stepfather had gone to Capay
with a load of wood. After dinner I in
vited them to go down to the clearing,
where I was working. I resumed work
and paid little attention to their move
ments. About half-past 10 o'clock there
was a sharp report, and I felt a stinging
sensation on the side of the head. The
blow staggered but did not knock me
down. I looked around, and only one
boyâ the smaller oneâ was in sight, and
he was running away. He stopped and
came back to me. ;;.
"The younger, boy denied that his
brother fired the shot, but I am positive
that he did. In fact a friend of mine
caught the older lad in the act of reloading
the gun shortly after the shooting. I can
assign no reason for the deed. I have no
enemies that I know of."
The Stevens brothers are stepsons of A.
McMillan of Capay Valley. A short time
ago a rifle was stolen from a neighboring
farmer and the theft was traced to the
Stevens boys, who acknowledged the
crime, and in returning the rifle avoided
arrest. The oldest one of the brothers has
not yet attained his majority.

ALASKA MINE DISASTER
Five Men Dangerously Injured
by an Explosion in the
Treadwell.
Reports of the Suffering at Juneau
. Confirmed by Returning
Passengers.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 14.â The steam"
ship Wiilapa, which arrived to-day from
Alaska, brought news of an explosion oc
curring on April 3 in the famous Treadwell
mine. Five men, two of whom cannot re
cover, were dangerously injured. Those
fatally hurt are Thomas Oleberge and Peter
Noveau.
Very discouraging reports concerning
the condition of affairs in Alaska are made
by the Willapa's passengers. Frank E.
Bryant, formerly .superior, officer of the
Seattle Police Department, and one of the
Willapa's return passengers, says there
are from 300 to 400 penniless men in
Juneau, and that' with the departure of
every vessel for the States scores of these
unfortunates congregate on the wharf beg
ging the captain for dead-head passage.
The Cooks Inlet region, he declares, is
being given the go-by by experienced
miners, hut that district is literally swarm
ing with prospectors. At the time of Bry
ant's departure very few men had suc
ceeded in crossing the pass into the Yukon
fields owing to the severe weather.
The Yukon mail, carried by Davis and
Stewart, is reported lost for the third time
this winter, and with it a valise containing
$800. .; I
The rush to Alaska is subsiding, and the
steamer Al-Ki,when it sails to-morrow, will
not have to exceed twenty-five passengers,'
including those from Puget Sound ports.
Penned In by Snow.
SEATTLE. Wash., April 14.â A private
letter received in this city from Arthur
Berry, formerly warden of the United
States : Penitentiary on McNeil's Island,
who left for Alaska a month ago, says that
three hundred miners bound for the Yukon
are snowed in at the base of the divide^ or
pass, between Cooks Inlet and the Yukon.
Aâ  ' fierce snowstorm was raging at the
time the letter was written, ten days ago,
and the prospects of the men being able to
cross the mountains were not only discour
aging, but the writer is of the opinion that
many will perish.
Nevada's honored dead.

UNA WA I TRAIN AT TUCSON.
Break* From a Locomotive on a Steep
Grade and Is Ditched.
TUCSON. Ariz., April 14.â Word was re
ceived at the Southern Pacific office at 8
o'clock this morning that a gravel train
being used near Vails station, eighteen
miles east on the main line, had broken
away from a locomotive and was on its
way toward this city, as it would meet
with no obstruction till it reached the
yards. Instructions were given and prepa
ration made to receive the runaway.
Switches were all set for sidetracking, so
as to derail the train in the yards.
A few minutes before No. 19, the east
bound passenger, was due the caboose and
thirteen gravel-cars came bearing down
from the east at a high rate of speed, and
as the switchspurs were struck the cars
plowed their way through the yard, wreck
ing everything except the caboose and two
cars. No one was injured, but the damage
to the company's rolling stock is consid
erable. If the accident had occurred half
an hour later the runaway would have met
the eastbound passenger on an upgrade.
Illegal Fiahing at Vallejo.
VALLEJO, Cal., April 14.â P. Resso, a
fisherman, was fined $100 to-day for illegal
fishing, he having been caught by Fish
Commissioner Davis with over 600 pounds
of striped bass on his boat off Army Point.
The net used was made of meshes "smaller
than the lawful size.
WOODLAND ARSON CASE
Shepherd & Collum's Actual Loss
in the Woolen Mill Fire
Is Investigated.
District Attorney Hopkins Accuses a
Woman Witness of Favoring
the Defendants.
WOODLAND, Cal., April 14.â The pre
liminary examination of Shepherd & Col
lum, the proprietors of the Woodland
Woolen Mill, accused of having caused
the destruction of the plant by fire in
order to cash a heavy insurance policy,
was resumed before Justice Lamton to
day. The burden of the testimony intro
duced was in support of the prosecution's
contention . that the two men had little
money invested in the mill and a small
stock on hand. Miss Watkins, the book
keeper for Shepherd & Collum, was shown
a copy of a statement of stock on hand on
January 11 and was asKed:
"How much were the proceeds from the
sale of merchandise at the time the
invoice was made?" ..."._ ._.,
"Thirteen thousand dollars," was her
reply.
"Including the expense account it
reached how much?"
"Sixteen thousand nine hundred and
six dollars.
"How much of this amount was invested
in the mill by the defendants?"
"1 do not know without referring to my
books." : y> y
"Miss Watkins," continued District At
torney Hopkins, "isn't it a fact that you
have already testified on two occasions
what amounts the defendants invested ? I
submit the question again ; how much did
they invest?"
"Shepherd invested $500 and Collum $400,
besides $600, the amount of the dye stuffs
purchased from Mr. Laugenour."
"As bookkeeper, what was the largest
sum on any single occasion you ever cred
ited?" {
"1 do not know."
"Was there ever entered $2000?"
"No, sir."
"One thousand dollars?"
"No."
"Five hundred dollars?"
"No."
"Three hundred dollars?"
"No. There were seldem any large
amounts of cash on hand."
District Attorney Hopkins caused a sen
sation by declaring that Miss Watkins was
unfriendly to the State. He said she had
told him at one time that if Shepherd &
Collum invested $7500 in the business her
books were in error to that extent. The
case went over until to-morrow.

COCOS ISLAND'S
HIDDEN RICHES.
Futile Search of Stockton
Men for a Pirate
Cache.
ARE NOT YET DISMAYED
Believe They Will in Time
Find the Store of Buried
Doubloons.
ENRICHED BY THEIR QUEST.
Coffee Planted on the Island Will
Yield a Fortune to the Lucky
Concessionaires.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 14. â Jacob
Simon of this city, the proprietor of the
Columbia House, has received some good
news from the island of Cocos, about 350
miles off the coast of Costa Rica, in which
he and Captain Geisler are interested.
Several years ago Geisler learned that
millions of dollars in treasure was buried
on the island. Expeditions had been sent
before to discover the hiding-place of the
buried wealth, but Geisler secured a chart
from some source that purported to give
the location. He needed money to back
his enterprise, and so he managed to in
' terest Jacob Simon of this city, who is pos
sessed of considerable wealth and is a keen
business man. Simon fitted out an expe
dition here, and the schooner Hayseed
was secured for the trip. It was pro
visioned for a long voyage and a party of
Stockton men were selected to man it.
All were enthusiastic over the prospect of
securing the millions that were reported to
be buried on the island, and were willing
to brave any dangers to get the hidden
wealth.
The island was reached, but the expedi
tion did not prove to be a success, as the
treasure could not be located. The
schooner returned with its men after a
time, but Geisler still had faith in the ulti
mate success of his plans and so had
Simon. The island had rich soil upon it,
and Captain Geisler saw a chance to get
hold of it until such time as he could lo
cate the treasure that he was convinced
was hidden there. He made an offer to
the Costa Rican Government and obtained
a concession to farm the island for a long
term of years. He at once set about ar
ranging to colonize the island. Numbers
of Germans were brought from their na
tive land and put at work planting coffee.
This was three years ago, and yesterday
Simon received a letter from the island
telling him that the coffee was getting
ripe and that a good crop would be har
vested this year. This was very pleasing j
information to Simon, as it takes nearly I
five years for coffee to grow from the bean j
on the mainland.
Geisler has never given up the idea of
finding the buried doubloons. Some time
ago he learned that an old seaman in Bos
ton knew something of the spot where the
gold was supposed to be bidden. He went
at once to that city and found the man. A
new chart was made, indicating very
nearly the place where the money was
buried, and he hopes to locate it. Even if
the money is never found Simon and Geis
ler will make a fortune out of the island.
They are anxious to colonize it, and have
made a liberal offer for any who wish to
go there and who will cultivate the land.
Joseph Heine, one of the crew of the
Echooner Hayseed, is in the city and gives
a glowing account of the beauties of the
little island. It is only six miles across
and is nearly all high land. According to
Heine, the mercury on the warmest days
celdom registers above 90 degrees and at
night the temperature drops to 65 degrees.
The island is heavily wooded and there
are millions of birds upon it. The only
animals are the wild hogs, which are there
. in great numbers and are very vicious.
There are two little bays on the island-
Chatham Bay and Wafer Bayâ and it was
in one of these that the party from the
Hayseed landed in 1898. They hunted for
six weeks without success, in one of the
places the water preventing them from
digging deeper than they did.
The treasure supposed to be hidden on
the island amounts to $60,000,000, accord
ing to the traditions handed down to
those who are now searching for it. It '
was in 1821 that it was supposed to have
been buried there by the pirates who
robbed the ship Relampago off Acapulco
and took the money that was being sent
from Mexico to Spain. Two Englishmen
named Thompson and Chapel, who were
of the pirate crew, made charts that were
handed down by them to the next genera
tion, and these are the ones that Captain
Geisler and Simon hope some day to
locate the money with.
WORTH T ALL THE PRAISE.
Report on the Final Trial of the Battle
ship Indiana.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 14.-The
Â«port of the Board of Naval Officers ap
pointed to conduct the final or efficiency
trial of the battleship Indiana has been re
ceived at the Navy Department. It shows
that the vessel is worthy of all the praise
that has been bestowed on her. Her hull,
engines, machinery and fittings were
found to be faultless. The trial took place
on the voyage between Port Royal, S. C,
and Norfolk, which the Indiana "made in
forty hours. Although run under natural
draught and with four boilers only, she
maintained an avarage speed of 13Â»X knots,
an excellent showing for a ship designed
to run 15 knots under the best conditions.
The horsepower developed was nearly
0000. There was very little roll, the maxi
mum being 20 degrees in a heavy cross-sea.
This trial completes the official testing of
the Indiana and the percentage of the con
tract price retained to insure any changes
or repairs for which the contractors might
he held accountable will now be paid to
the Messrs. Cramps.
Rank for Veterinary Surgeon*.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 14.-The
House Military Committee to-day, after

port on the bill giving to veterinary sur
geons of the army the rank of second lieu
tenants of cavalry. It provides, however,
that the surgeons who are promoted shall
be graduates of veterinary colleges.

TACOMA, Wash., April 14.â Demo- j
cratic State Convention to-night adopted
the follow ing platform :
Recognizing that honest men may differ on
questions of party policy and principle we
differ from the President upon the financial
question. We commend the administration of
President Cleveland as honest, able and fear
less, and we now reaffirm our unshaken con
fidence In the integrity, Americanism and
patriotism of the great chief magistrate of the
Nation. '-'â -
Wo believe in the Monroe doctrine, as in
terpreted by President Cleveland and his able
Secretary of State, Richard Olney. We de
mand the free and unlimited coinage of silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting for the
intervention of any other nation.
The effort in the committee on resol v.
ions to have a plank inserted instructing
*the delegation to the National Convention
to vote for silver failed of passage after a
stormy three hours' committee session.
The election of delegates to the National
Democratic Convention at Chicago resulted
in the choice of H. C. Wallace, W. H.

free coinage. Three of the number, how
ever, are known to be goldites.
CRUEL SAUSALITO VOTERS.
Why the Band Did Not Play After the
Votes Were Counted.
SAUSALITO, Cal., April 14.â
trouble in Sausalito is not yet ended by
any means. The encounter between Creed
and Brandes was the opening of hostilities.
Before the election Creed said that either
he or Brandes would have to get out of the
town or there would be trouble. Creed
Creed overwhelmingly defeated Brandes
at the polls, so either Brandes must take
leave or await developments.
Alfred Brandes is the night watchman
in Sausalito and John E. Creed is the
Marshal. The night watchman's remuner
ation is obtained by subscriptions from
the people on his route, and in view of the
recent troubles many of his customers, it
is said, are leaving him. Whether Creed
j intends to carry out his threat remains to
be seen, but the people of Sausalito who
know him say that he will.
Among the election stories going the
rounds is one on the Sausalito brass band.
It seems that Antone Lawrence, the day
before election, hired the band to play
when the result of the election was an
nounced.
Lawrence was confident of being elected
and so had made arrangements accord
ingly. Lawrence was defeatea by just
three votes. While the ballots were being
counted at the Town Hall the members of
the band were getting in trim to thunder
forth the strains of country music in honor
of Lawrence. Buttons were brightened,
the tiny lamps that the members wear in
their hats on dress occasions were refilled
and lighted, and never before had the
boys appeared so well.
At the risk of spoiling their uniforms
they were going out in the fog to play for
Lawrence. They assembled at their room
in the basement of a local hotel and waited
for the summons to march out and cele
brate. It never came. Fiedler had de
feated Lawrence by three votes.

SANTA CRUZ LABOR EXCHANGE.
It Purchase* a Grocery Store and Will
Operate a Sawmill.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 14.â That
the Labor Exchange Association means
business and is doing business is
no longer a . matter of speculation,
for yesterday Santa Cruz Branch No.
106 bought the stock of groceries, provis
ions and general merchandise of W. H.
Crowe at 12 Pacific avenue, and that gro
cery is now being conducted under labor
exchange methods.
The committee that has the mill propo
sition in hand has received all the neces
sary machinery and tools, and in a week
or so the sawmill near Soquel will be run
ning in full blast, with a force of from
thirty to fifty men. There is in the timber
tract owned by the exchange 169 acres, and
it is estimated it will produce from 3,000,
--000 to 5,000,000 feet of lumber.
The shipments will not depend upon
railroad transportation, as the port at
Capitola is as near to the sawmill as is the
railroad.
GRADING NEAR MERCED.
Valley Road Constructors Are Making
Rapid Progress.
MERCED, Cal., April 14.â Three large
grading outfits have passed through this
city within the past two days, bound for
the surveyed line of the Valley road
lying between Minturn and Madera and
beyond. v'y
They come from the completed work at
the Tuolumne River, and are the outfit of
the Grant Bros., which were used in grad
ing the road from Stockton out. Contrac
tor McDougald has a large force of laborers
at work throwing up the roadbed between
this city and the Merced River, and expects
to reach this point with the grade by the
first week in May. The distance from
Merced River to the depot site in this city
is about fourteen miles. Mr. McDougald
will have several miles of the road graded
by next Wednesday, when he will move
his camp from the river out onto the
plains. 'yy-Y'-
Santa Cruz Accident.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 14.â
Waterman was thrown from a buggy this
afternoon, receiving injuries which will
probably result in his death. Young
Waterman and Levi Hanna, son of the
late Captain Hanna, were riding in a buggy

The horse shied at a passing vehicle,
throwing the young men to the ground.
Waterman's head struck a post, fracturing

Fresno's Electric Power.
FRESNO, Cal., April 14.â The pumps at
the city water works were to-day run by
electricity for the first time. The new
company, which is bringing the power
from the San Joaquin River, thirty-five
miles distant, has turned on the current.
A test was made several days ago with the

chinery has been put in, and a 75-horse
power pump was to-day run as smoothly
as if it weighed but a few uoundt.

DOGS AND FISHES.
A Valuable Canine Shot in the Presidio
Reservationâ Bass From San Diego.
Fish Commissioner Babcock received a
letter yesterday from Deputy Al Wilson,
who Is at present located near the great
bass and pickerel lake in San Diego County
with his companion, Cross. Wilson says
that owing to the extreme cold weather of
the past week it was utterly impossible for
him to draw seines for bass. He arrived
at the lake on the 9th inst., in the midst
of a blinding snowstorm, and he imme
diately concluded that it would be very
unwise on his part to attempt the capture
j of bass and pickerel until such time as the
weather would permit. He is in hopes
that an opportunity will soon permit of
the capture of several fish which, on their
arrival in this City, will be transported to
Clear Lake, in Lake County.
A handsome fox-terrier, the property of
Mr. Martin, the manager of the Sharon
estate, was shot and- killed recently by a
soldier at the Presidio. Mr. Martin was
accompanied by his two favorite dogs
while taking a short walk near the military
reservation. Something attracted the at
tention of the canines, and they unfor
tunately ran within the line, so to speak,
and before their owner could reach them
a soldier leveled His rifle at one and fired.
The aim of the blue coat proved deadly,
and a. he was about to aim at the second
dog its owner interfered and some warm
exchanges of words followed. The soldier
informed Mr. Martin that he was carrying
out strict orders from General Graham
and was obeying a command.
Dog No. 2 was taken in charge and
turned over to the Poundkeeoer. This
should serve as a warning to the owners of
valuable dogs to steer clear of the Presidio
when out for a constitutional with their
canine charges.
The Fly-casters' Club met last evening
in the Flood building, Market street, and
discussed at length the advisability of

conditions are favorable for exercise and
sport. The club expects a large number of
entries for its summer tournament.
Entries for the Pacific Kennel Club's
bench show, which will be held next month
at the Pavilion, are being received, and
judging from the interest that is being
shown by fanciers in the show, success is
bound to crown the efforts of the mana
gers.

Mrs. Cannon is a type of the Mormon

is nothing special in her appearance to
distinguish her from the millions of good

those who come within the radius of her

PROGRESS OF TEE WORK

by the Secretaries of the
Institutions.
MR. BUDD NAILS A CANARD.
The Governor Prove 3 That He Did Not
Speak Disparagingly of San
Jose Grounds.
SAN JOSE, 'CaI., April 14.â A joint
meeting of the boards of trustees of the
State Normal schools of this city, Los An
geles and Chico convened at the Normal
School in this city this morning. The
meeting was called to order by President
Henry French of the San Jose board. The
following members were present:
San Jose boardâ President Henry French of
! Ban Jose, Mrs. E. A. Wilson of Oakland, F. An
gell of Stanford and R. E. Wilhoit of Stockton.
Los Angeles boardâ A. S. Davidson of San
Bernardino. T. P. Lukeus of Pasadena and F.
A, Molyneaux of Pomona.
Chico boardâ President F. C. Lusk and John
Bidwell of Chico, F. H. Groely of Marysville
and N. P. Chipman of Red Blu'ft.
State Superintendent of Instruction S.
T. Black; E. T. Piece, secretary of the
Los Angeles board; R. F. Penned, secre
tary of the Chico board, and Miss Blasdel,
secretary of the San Jose board, were also
present.
The principals' reports were read and
thoroughly discussed. The recommenda
tions that the present text-books be con
tinued were adopted. It was decided to
leave it with the faculty at the several
schools and their Boards of Trustees to
use discretion as to the time limit for
graduates of high schools to complete the
course.
President Childs' report for the thirty
third year says the raising of the standard
of the school had the effect of increasing
the enrollment, which is now 710 in the
Normal department. This is attributed to
the fact that the grammar grade and high
school standards of the public schools
have been raised. He reviews the work of
the past year and concludes that the school
is in a splendid condition, the past year
being in many respects the best. It is
also shown that, according to statistics,
800 new teachers are needed annually in
California. Of this number, the Normal
schools furnish 225 and the rest are the re
sult of county examinations and immi
grations.
Secretary Robert F. Pennell's report of
the Chico school was of a very encourag
ing nature. It stated that the school was
doing a great work, for Northern Califor
nia and causing the demand for trained
teachers to continually increase.
Secretary E. T. Piece made an extenaed
report of the Los Angeles school. In his
review it appeared that the enrollment in
1894-95 was 475 and in 1895-96 498.
Governor Budd was present at the even
ing session of the joint board. The first
business was the selection of dates on
on which to hold the meetings of the
various local boards. The Los Angeles
meeting will be held May 27, Chico meet
ing June 2 and the San Jose meeting
June 25.
John Kid well of Chico, T. P. Lukensand
Henry French were appointed a commit
tee to suggest changes in the Normal
School laws. One suggestion decided upon
is that Normal School Trustees be put
upon the same footing as trustees of insane
asylums and penitentiaries in reference to
the allowance of expenses made in the
discbarge of duties in the service of the
State.
The interesting portion of the session '
was brought about in an informal way. It
having been reported that Professor Childs
had quoted Governor Budd as referring to
the San Jose Normal School grounds as
a ranch, toe Governor took occasion to ask
the professor when and where that state
ment had been made by him. After being
pinned down to the question, Professor
Childs replied that he did not remember

// A man's physical well being is

* It is part of her duty in the world to

down, she should take measures to stop it.
Very few men enjoy being sick. They
won't admit even to themselves that they
are sick. They will go on losing flesh and
vitality working too hard â worrying too
hard taking little or no care of their
health. Maybe they need only a little help
to be made well. Maybe a good simple
tonic is all they require. Maybe it is some-
thing more serious. Whichever it is, it
should be attended to. When a man gets
really sick, his work stops. He can't tend
to business. He loses all he has previously
gained. Actual want may stare him in the
face. It doesn't pay to get sick, or to stay
sick. There's no need of doing either. Dr.

prevent sickness. It is a blood helper and
a flesh builder. It restores perfect diges-

JNO. MONAHAN,
412 Commercial Street.
As I live by the pen I must say that one
of the most pleasant and affable gentlemen
it has been my good fortune to meet po
litely gave me an interview yesterday.
His name is John Monahan and he is a
printer a printer known far and wide on
the Pacific Coast. People had told me of
Mr. Monahan, so that I had come prepared
to meet a good-natured man and was not
at all embarrassed when he smilingly told
me what he thought of California, her
products and her Sarsaparilla. Said he:
"On the subject of Sarsaparilla my opinion
is fixed. While I have no reason to know
or to say that other sarsaparillas are of no
value, 1 have every reason to know and to
say that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is of
inestimable value, for not only have some
of my relatives used it, but I have actually
tried the Sarsaparilla and know its true
value. It is a delicate matter for one to
speak of the virtues of a proprietary rem
edy. Nevertheless, the truth stands in the
bright light of reason and overcomes deli
cate feelings, for the truth is mighty, and
the mighty truth is that Joy's Sarsaparilla
is made of California herbs and contains
no deleterious mineral poisons. I am
personally acquainted with a gentleman
who suffered from violent headaches, and
be suffered continuously, and perhaps
would have been Buffering now but that
he used the home remedy, Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. He recommends Joy's Vege
table Sarsaparilla, and so do I. It is a
very pleasing remedy for women because
it is not nasty to the taste and its effects
are pleasant. In the spring of the year,
when nature is at work renewing herself,
he who desires to renew and make rich
the blood can do no better than use the
home remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa
rilla."
As I left John Monahan, the printer, I
could not help but think what an abund
ance of philosophic humor he possessed.

The management at Ingleside offered a
race for gentlemen riders at a mile as a
special feature of the day's racing-card. It
was a razzle dazzle sort of an affair and it
is to be hoped the next one will be run in
1901. Several ofthe young fellow, belong
ing to the select Blingum crowd were orig
inally carded to don the silk, but forjeome
unknown reason did not appear on the
scene, depriving the event of much inter
est. Of the five starters left in, Walter J,
with W. B. Sink Jr. in tne saddle, held
sway in the betting, backed down from 6
to 5t04 to ,i. Mr. Sink did not tarry with
bis mount, but took him out in front and
won all the way, with Monita, ridden by
Mr. Schwartz, an ordinary second. Ike
L, with Henry Forsland, the form-book
man, to do the piloting, opened a strong
second choice at 8 to 5, but receded down
to 2% to 1. Donathan's colt was taken so
far out of it from the jump that he never
had a chance, finishing a poor third.

badly the last part of the trip. Mr. Stein
abstracted not a little speed out of the
remaining starter, Nellie G, at the com
mencement, but she, too, grew very leg
weary. _ .
The going was a trifle slippery, which
tended to upset the calculations of the
form players and handicappers somewhat.
The lirst choices fared very well, though,
capturing three of the six events.
The opening six-furlong dash was taken
by Japonica, a full sister to the trood per
former. Joe Murphy. Backed down from
4to 2 1 *,' to 1, she disposed of the 9-to-5
favorite. Carnation, throuph the stretch
and won with little to spare by a length.
The "Over the- Mountain" handicap,
simmered down to a six-furlong selling
affair, proved a gift for the even money
favorite, Kamsin, who won in a gallop,
with the second choice, Mobalaska, finish

at the end, finishing a good third.
Tnero were but live starters in the six

manded first call in the betting, but the
going evidently did not suit him, for he
| ran unplaced. Montallade, a4oto 1 out

! he was passed by both William Tinkerton
! and Sam Leake. The former, who, con
! trary to his usual custom, came from the
! rear, beat Sam Leake out a couple of
! lengths. *â  : ' ;
Old Service was played for a "moral in
the mile selling run, a barrel of coin eoing
into the books on his chances at 4to 5,
which price was finally rubbed to 13 to 20.
The 6 to 5 second choice imp. Miss Brum

him out at the wire by two lengths. Tobey

CHRISTIAN CYCLERS.
They Reorganize the Old Y. M. C. A.
Bicycle Club as the Triangle
Club.
Bicycles and bicyclers took up quarters
in the Y. M. C. A. building last night.
The former, of various brands and degrees
of merit, were mounted on stands in the
lecture hall ana amusement room for
the admiration of the latter, who, arrayed
in knickerbockers and sweaters or in fault
less evening costume, promenaded up and
down both apartments discoursing learn
edly on the relative excellences of the
rival wheels. There were bicycles for men
and for women, single tandem and triple
or quadruple, painted, gilded or polished
as the several manufacturers might choose,
and the machines made a very tine display.
At 8:30 o'clock in the evening the cyclers
and their guests assembled in the banquet
hall, where full justice was done to an
elaborate dinner menu. When the coffee
was brought on. C. F. Stewart, president
of the old Y. M. C. A. Bicycle Club, an
nounced that th. club would be reorgan
ized under the name of the Triangle Club,
and that the charter would be left open for
signatures. Dr. J. A. Kuykendall, cap
tain of the club, also made a brief address,
and Dr. A. N. Couture, Frank Hancock
and Robert Cranston gave several songs
and dramatic selections. The Rev. H. L.
Dietz and General Secretary McCoy also
spoke, and a number of new members
signed the charter roll.
SHORT IN HIS ACCOUNTS.
Thomas S. Atherstone Is Ar
rested for Felony Embezzle
ment.
He Has Been Head Bookkeeper for the
Singer Sewing Machine Company
for Twenty-Five Years.
"W. B. Fry, Pacific Coast agent for the
Singer Sewing Machine Company, swore
out a warrant in Judge Low's court last
Friday for the arrest of Thomas S. Ather
stone, the head bookkeeper, on a charge of
felony embezzlement.
At the request of the police Judge Low
kept the complaint in his pocket and re
fused to give any information about it.
Detective Ross Whittaker was detailed on
the case, and with the assistance of De
tective Holland of Oakland located Ather
stone at his residence in Oakland yester
day morning and arrested him. Last
night he was booked at the City Prison.
Atherstone has been in the employment
of the company for the past twenty-five
years. He is a man of family and has al
ways borne a good reputation in the com
munity. A few days aero he wrote to Fry
that be was short in his accounts, but he
would make good the deficiency as soon as
he could. He went to Tehama County to
visit some friends and returned home on
Monday night. He at once went to Fry's
residence to make arrangements as to pay
ing up the deficiency. Tbey talked the
matter over, and it was soon arranged that
Atherstone should aeain see Fry jester
day morning. He did so and Fry agreed
to meet him later in the day.
When Atherstone returned to his resi
dence from his visit to Fry the detectives
were waiting for him and placed him un
der arrest. Fry learned of the arrest and
hurried to the City Hall with Attorney
Husted. At his request Judge Low re
duced Atherstone's bonds from $5000 to
$1000. and later agreed to release him on
his own recognizance.
It was against Fry's own judgment that
Atherstone was arrested, but he had to

five-mile handicap road race over the

On May 7 and 8, during the Healdsburg
flower festival, cycle races will be held
there on the new three-lap track in Luce's
Park, which is a splendid racing circuit.

in a few days, and the track will be com
pleted and ready for training purposes be
fore the end of this month.
H. E. McCrea and Emil Ulbricht, the

showings in the relay race Sunday, will go
south this morning, stopping at Santa Bar
bara to compete in the races at the flower
festival there this week. Theyjhave been
royally entertained by the Bay Citys while
here. As both will probably be in the pro

able to compete in another relay, as it is
open only to amateurs.

Reliance Club Wheelmen of Oakland will
take place next Sunday, the start being

WHALES OF MONTEREY.
Dr. Ord Says the Leviathans
Are There in Wonderful
Numbers.
GRAY, FINBACK AND SPERM.
Formerly Rubbed Away the Barna
cles and Other Parasitesâ Some
History Corrected.
Dr. J. L. Ord of Monterey and Santa
Barbara, who probably knows more rela
tive to the early history of California than
any other American living, is at the Occi
dental. He is a large man, with a full,
florid face, and hair and mustache as white
as the driven snow. In every way he is a
striking man, and his reminiscenses are
as interesting as many a novel.
. He says that whales are very numerous
Dr. J. L. Ord of the Famous Ship Lexington Gives His Views on the Whales of
Monterey Bay and the Unreliability of History.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
in Monterey Bay now. It is very unusual
for so many of tnem to be there.
"I arrived at Monterey in January,
1847," said the gentleman, yesterday, "on
the United States ship Lexington. I came
with Company F, Third Artilierv, after
ward the crack regiment of the Mexican
War. General Hal leek was in command,
my brother, E. O. C. Ord, first lieutenant,
and I myself was surgeon. My brother, as
is now well known historically, afterward
became general. lam now the only officer
of the ship who is alive.
"It astonishes me the way many people
make history in California. Half the his
tory we have isn't true. Those stage
drivers down on my part of the coast say
anything and everything, and it is taken
for truth and put down in writing by men
who ought to know better. They could
get the facts if they would go to the per
sons who really knew what they were. "
"I have noticed a great many of those
mistakes in history. For instance, as to
the pulling down of the Mexican flag at
Monterey. The Mexican flag used at tne
Custom-house by the Mexican authorities
was not the one that was burned.
"Pablo de la Guerera was the Custom
house officer at the time. He took the
flag down and gave it to his sister, Mrs.
Jimeno, and she hid it. Afterward De la
Guerera became a State Senator and Dis
trict Judge at Santa Barbara, and finally
Lieutenant-Governor.
"The Lieutenant-Governor was the son
of Jose de la Guerera of Santa Barbara,
whose house was built in 1804. 1 have
learned that an English priest was sent
out here to sound the people and see if
they would not be willing to come under
the protection of England. They told him
no, they vastly preferred the Americans.
"From 1848 to ' 1849 I lived in Santa
Barbara, when I came back to Monterey.
The war was over and we disbanded. I
have lived off and on at Santa Barbara
and Monterey since then. I also Jived
for a while in Arizona, and for two and a
half years, from 1871 to 1873, I was Consul-
General to Mexico.
"I had studied Latin and French, and
when I arrived here i easily mastered the
Spanish language. It has* been very use
ful to me. I have a 3000-acre ranch in
Santa Barbara County, the fourth of an
old Spanish grant, where I spend a good
deal of my time. I have two sons-in-law,
both in the army. One is Captain Robert
Read of tbe Tenth Cavalry, Fort Custer,
Mont., and the other is Captain J. H.
Peshin, military attache at the court of
Spain at Madrid. ;b
"There is a large number of whales in
the Monterey Bay. It reminds me some
what of the .old days. There are two
kinds, the gray and the finback:. Now and
then you see a sperm whale. It was once
a great place for whales. I have seen two
or three at a time rolling on the beach.
They were so plentiful that they knocKed
all the barnacles and other parasites off."
The doctor will leave fur his ranch at
Santa Barbara in a day or two.
HE USED A BELT.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of Ex-
Policeman Greeley for Beating
Mis' Wife.
John Greeley, an ex-policeman, living at
210 Church street, and his wife got on a
drunk together on Monday night. They
were both arrested and taken to the Seven
teenth-street station. When Mrs. Greeley
awoke yesterday morning her face was
bruised and swollen, and tier eyes were
blackened. She went before Judge Low
and swore out a warrant for Greeley's ar
rest on the charge of battery. She said he
had beaten her with his police belt, using
the end with : the buckle. She was' in a
highly excited state, and her voice woke
the echoes in the courtroom as she recited
her woes to the Judge. Greeley could not
be found up to last night. The couple have
three children, and the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children will en
deavor to get control of them. â â â - .:â¢' .
Mrs. Mary McMorrow, a neighbor of the
Greeleys, who had her door smashed in
by Greeley on Monday night, was arrested
yesterday afternoon by Officers Holbrook
and McMurray of the Society for the Pre
! vention of Cruelty to Children on the charge
of cruelty to her little girl, who was sent
to the Children's Hospital. She is a suf
ferer from spasms.
FRENCH UNION.
Entertainment That Reflected Credit
on the' Participant*.
The Young Girls' Society gatnered tinder
the auspices ofthe French Christian Union
of California and gave a most interesting
social at its headquarters on Clay street
Sunday evening.
The programme comprised recitations
in French and English, vocal ana instru
mental music and a one-act play in
French, expressly composed for the young
girls' schools, the whole being carried off
with great spirit by the young girls, who
showed great natural talent, considering
they are all self-supporting and therefore
have but little time to give to the prepara
tion of so full a programme.
Mile. Aegerber, their president, is an
authoress and read admirably a poem of her
own, introducing the work of their society
in the most poetical manner. She sus
tained the principal role in the little play,
representing a young nursery maid pos
sessed with the versifying passion. She
was very ably supported by Miles. Vasseur,
Donze, Kogalle, Key and little 10-year-old
Adele Vercoutere. A young missionary
teacher from Papeete, who recently came
to this City, recited in French, sang in
Tahitian dialect and wore the costume of
the nativesâ very effectively. With Miles.
S<^e]i, Brison, Gardner, Winteler and
Wright, who recited and sang and played
the piano in a charming manner, the two
hours given to the programme were found
too short by all present.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Attend the primaries.
â . Â»
Vote early and vote right.
The Republican procession starts to-day.
The report of the funding bill may make
a big noise, but it won't scare anybody.
Don't forget that every loyal Republican
should take part in the primaries of the
party.
The bosses and the gangs went through
their crooked tricks yesterday and to-day
straight politics has a chance.
Mr. Huntington may force the funding
bill fight to an issue if he chooses. This is
just as good a time to settle it as any.
If General Weyler continues to right it
out on the present line it will take all sum
mer to show which way he is moving.
Cleveland is hiding behind something
on the Cuban question, but whether it be
discretion or pure cussedne.s is not cer
tain.
There is some talk among Eastern !
Democrats about "signs and signal fires of j
possible victory," but they are deceived j
by smoke.
The California delegation to the St. j
Louis convention must be left free to ad
vance California interests in every issue
that arises there.
The prospect of having California repre
sented in the Cabinet of the next adminis
tration is cheering to all except those who
are too blind to see it.
â â
The RÂ«publican who is truly loyal to the
great principles the party represents cares
more for the party as a whole than for any j
particular leader of it.
All good Republicans in the City should \
make it a part of their duty to see to it
that San Francisco has a strong delegation
at the State convention.
The Tories have introduced into Parlia
ment what they call an "Irish land bill,"
but according to the Home Rulers it hasn't
a particle of Irish ground to stand on.
'
No man with any prospect of a political
future wishes tho Democratic Presidential
nomination this year, but there are plenty
of back numbers eager to fill the vacancy.
The shopkeeper who never has the thing
you ask for, but is always ready to offer
you "something just as good," ought al
ways to be allowed to keep it for his enter
prise.
From this time forth until election day
politics should be a part of the business of
every man who is concerned in American
industry and seeks the welfare of the
American people.
â¦
According to Senator Hill, if the Demo
cratic party "has the wisdom of its wants"
it will nominate Morrison of Illinois, so
we may count on it that Morrison is fore
doomed to defeat.
â¢
The primaries of yesterday, like the
bosses who managed them, are back num
bers, and the true Republicans who are up
to date will get in with the primaries and
the leaders of to-day.
It is significant that the men who are
urging the claims of Morrison of Illinois
for the Democratic nomination are much
given to a habit of informing the world
that he hates Cleveland.
Â»
As the resolution calling for an investi
gation of the bond deals is in order for the
Senate to take up to-day there is a chance
for a lively session, provided it is taken up
in the right Way and handled well.
The strength of California at the Repub
lican National Convention will have but
little influence unless the men who repre
sent it there are left free to exercise it in
bringing about the nomination of the best
man.
The delay in the construction of our
Postoffice building is one of the things we
suffer from the Democratic deficit, but per
haps a little more energy on the part of
our delegation in Congress could hurry it
up a little.
The Democratic scheme of running a
gold ticket and a silver ticket during the
campaign and then uniting their votes in
the electoral college is about as good as
any scheme the Democrats could desire,
but it won't work.
There will be a free vote and a fair count
at every polling-place of the Republican
primaries to-day and all members of the
party should avail themselves of the op
portunity to cast a ballot for men of their
choice to represent them in the coming
State convention.
As a general rule the article that is most
advertised is tbe best of its kind, for while
it never pays to advertise a worthless thing
it always pays to advertise a good one;
and those who do not know the relative
values of two similar articles will never
make a mistake in asking for that which
is most widely made known.
The Immigration restriction bill should
be hurried through Congress without the
formality of debate, for the public is well
posted on the subject and further discus
sion is not necessary, while on the other
hand it is known that thousands of pauper
immigrants are pouring into the country
and every day's delay in the passage of
the bill permits just so many more to
enter.
THE PRIMARIES.
All the arrangements for the Republican
primaries to be held to-day have been
made with the one object of providing for
a free, fair and full expression of the
wishes of the majority of the members of
the party. There is, moreover, ovary pros
pect that the object desired will be at
tained. Republican enthusiasm was never
higher at so early a stage of a political
campaign, ard a large vote, as well as a
fair one, is virtually assured. .
This provision for an absolutely honest
primary election should certainly be made
use of by all loyal Republicans. It has
been known for a long time that most of
the evils attending our political system
have had their origin in the debasement of
the primaries. By obtaining control of
these, the political bosses have been en
abled to so direct and manage the whole
electoral mechanism of the law as to be
able to obtain almost any results they
pleased at later stages, and to practically
dictate the nominations of party conven
tions. It is significant of a better order of
things, therefore, that the Republican
party begins this campaign by redeeming
the primaries from the control of the
bosses and placing them under the super
vision of men who will assure that strict
political honesty which is summed up in
the phrase, "A fair ballot and a fair
count."
it is not too much to expect that the
better element of citizens who constitute
the great majority of the Republican
| party will show their appreciation of the
| new order of things by attending the pri
| maries to-day and casting a vote for the
j men whom they wish to represent them
j in the work of electing delegates to the
National convention that is to nominate
the next President of the United States.
Every man of business should to-day re
j gard politics as a part of his business and
j attend to it. Men who in the past have
abstained from primaries because they
have had well-grounded fears that their
votes would be thrown away or rendered
worse than useless by the boss rule that
has too often dominated such elections
may go to the polling-places to-day with
the assurance that every vote cast will be
counted, and that none but honest votes
will be either cast or counted.
The Republican party of this City is no
longer seriously affected by bosses or by
those who would like to be Dosses. The
real leaders of the party have come to the
front. That element known in the slang
of the day as the "push" and the "pull"
has been thrust aside. Honest primaries
are assured. It is now the duty of all
loyal Republicans to respond to this call,
and by voting at the elections to-day show
themselves on the side of square dealing j
and fair dealing in politics as in business. !
THE LOTTERY EVIL.
The Supreme Court was undoubtedly
compelled to declare invalid the Los Ange
les ordinance making the possession of a
lottery ticket a misdemeanor, but that
offers no consolation for the evil which
lias suddenly sprung up as the result of
that decision. The fatal defect of the ordi
nance was this qualifying clause: "Unless
said possession shall be shown to be inno
cent or for a lawful purpose." Clearly
this throws the burden of proof upon the
defendant, and that is a fatal defect. As
the San Francisco ordinance contains the
same clause the prosecution of persons
found with lottery tickets in their posses
sion has come to an end and peddlers
selling them are plying their trade from
one end of the City to the other.
Other lotteries besides Chinese are, of
course, affected, and they will probably
benefit more than the Chinese, for the
simple reason that most of the leading
daily newspapers of San Francisco are ad
vertising the outside lotteries every month
in flaming advertisements that excite the
cupidity of the poor and make them easy
prey. Our contemporaries would doubt
less advertise the Chinese lotteries also
were it not for the happy circumstance
that the Chinese are prohibited from con
ducting lotteries and dare not make their
operations public. i
The ability of the newspapers to adver
tise lotteries and of peddlers to sell tickets
has come iD both instances from inexcusa
ble carelessness or ignoranco in framing
the laws. The laws were honestly intend
ed to prohibit both evils, but the looseness
with which they were drawn could not
withstand the scrutiny of the Supreme
Court. Experience has shown that in the
absence of a proper moral sense, laws pro
hibiting such evils should receive the
most painstaking care.
One remedy remains, as far as the ped
dlers are concerned. That is for all high
minded citizens to assist the police in dis
covering Chinese lotteries. Tbe ingenuity
of the race in concealing its lawlessness is
a familiar fact. However zealous the po
lice may be, outside assistance is always
helpful. Nothing further can be done un
til the Legislature meets and passes laws
to cover the whole ground. Meanwhile
the poorer people of the City will con
tinue to be robbed and the press will
doubtless continue to lend its assistance.
OFFICIAL NEGLECT.
There is something radically wrong in
the office or person of the supervising
architect of the United States . at Wash
ington when, despite the fact that $216,
--736 is available for the work of construc
tion on the new San Francisco Postoffice,
that enterprise is absolutely ignored. Â» All
manner of petty excises have been ad
vanced for this neglect, among others that
the Postmaster of this City ana the Fed
eral Judges now located in the Appraisers
building have retarded the matter by fail
ing to promptly and properly pass on the
plans of the proposed building submitted
to them. These gentlemen aver that they
have in fact done everything to facilitate
the beginning of the construction of the
edifice.
It is the opinion of some that the dila
toriness of the department in the case is
due to lack of ready money, but this can
hardly be so in the face of the statement
made by the acting supervising architect
of the treasury to the Washington corre
spondent of The Call that "with the
balance left after the purchase of the site
and the $50,000 additional appropriated to
commence building, the amount now on
hand and available is $216,736."
Not long since an appropriation "wag
made for a new Postoffice building for
Chicago. Within three months thereafter
actual work had begun thereon. Califor
nia's Senators and Congressmen might
take a lesson from the representatives of
Illinois, by whose joint and energetic ac
tion this remarkable result was achieved.
If our nine representatives at Washington
united in a demand on the supervising
architect, asking for immediate attention
to the â  Postoffice matter, it is not likely
that there would be any farther dilly

dallying. But should their efforts prove
unavailing in this direction, there yet re
mains the drastic resort suggested by Sena
tor Perkins of introducing a resolution de
manding explicit information from the
Treasury Department why this work is
delayed, and directing the Secretary to
proceed with the construction imme
diately, y'yy
San Francisco is certainly in as great
need of her new Postoffice as is Chicago of
hers, and is not less worthy of considera
tion than her more populous sister city.
DEMOCRATIC TARIFF TINKERING
Political economists of the Democratic
school demand the nearest possible ap
proach to free trade on the ground that
protection prohibits competition, which is
the life of trade. No reasoning could be
more illogical from the standpoint of the
tariff schedules advocated by the Repub
lican party. It is true in a general sense
that competition is the life of trade, but
the line which separates that competition
which is the life of trade from that compe
tition which is the death of trade is broad
and well defined. The Kepublican party's
theory of protection to our industries does
not contemplate the prohibition of foreign
competition in our markets, but it does
mean that the operatives in our mills and
factories shall be protected against the
poverty-making wage schedules of foreign
countries, and that is the head, front and
soul of the incentive that actuates the Re
publican party in its energetic and persis
tent advocacy of protection.
It is no doubt true, as the leaders of the
Democracy claim, that were absolute free
trade to prevail in this country our indus
trial enterprises could and would continue
to supply our people with most of their
manufacture, but to do that the cost of
production would have to be lowered to
the cost of production in Europe, and as
the greatest item of cost is wages, even
the stupidest of men could not fail to see
that nearly the whole burden of the reduc
tion in manufactured commodity prices
would be borne by wage-earners. But
those who prepare raw materials for the
mills and factories would have to accept
the European standard of wages, too, for
in order to hold our own with foreign com
petition every factor in manufacture, from
raw material to finished product, would be
obliged to conform to the wage schedules
and gooas prices which prevail in the old
country.
The argument of the Democratic party
that free trade would strengthen the posi
tion of our farmers is as illogical and falla
cious as the assertion that the lower the
Custom-house charges on imports the better
would be the condition of wage-earners gen
erally. With the duty on farm products re
moved breadstuffs could be laid down at a
less cost to the consumer in the Atlantic
States from Argentina than from any
trans-Mississippi point. In that event
prices for American grain would be fixed
by Argentina, where farmhands receive
considerably less than one-half the wages
paid for similar work in this country.
It is needless to point to the good results
that came to the country through the op
eration of the act of 1890, for the large in
crease of wrecks of business enterprises
which may be seen strewn along every
channel of trade distribution testifies in no
uncertain voice that the Wilson act, which
repealed the law of 1890, is a vicious and
destructive attack upon the welfare of all
the peonle. But the Democratic theory of
the tariff problem prevails in fact, and
since the hurtful consequences of its influ
ence upon all lines of trade and manufac
ture is felt all along the way from the day
laborer to the mammoth industrial enter
prise, it is impossible to conceive any re
sult from the coming Presidential election
other than an emphatic and vehement re
buke to the un- Americanism of the Dem
ocratic party. Nevertheless, the snake
was only scotched in the State elections
that have been held since tnat fatal No
vember day in 1892. These facts should be
remembered by everyone who is for Amer
can industries, for high wages for Ameri
can workmen and for high prices for
American farm products.
A REMARKABLE LAW.
New York has passed through its second
Sunday under the Raines liquor law and
the odd working of the statute is now un
derstood. The law prohibits the Sunday
traffic in all kinds of liquors in barrooms,
restaurants, drugstores and the like, but
says nothing about hotels. As a conse
quence hotels have sprung up at a pro
digious rate. Every saloon that can find
as many as ten rooms above it has secured
them, thrown furniture into them and
transformed them into a "hotel." Even in
such cases, however, it is required that the
thirsty shall drink only in the course of a
meal. A sandwich which the customer
need not eat solves the difficulty. Under
the operation of that ordinarily useful
trait which makes the overcoming of ob
stacles a pleasant pastime. New York City
has gone mad with a desire to "beat the
law," and the result is to reduce the Raines
bill to an absurdity. The question of
evasion seems not yet to have been raised.
It appears ridiculous that a restaurant may
not sell liquors on Sunday while a hotel
cafe suffers under no such restriction.
A remarkable feature of the law is that
it represents the rural idea of conduct as
opposed to that of the urban. New York
State's large rural population has made it
possible for the man in the country to
bring down his heel upon the neck of his
arrogant city cousin. Such an event is
not uncommon in this country, but
hitherto country domination over city
pride has been confined to measures affect
ing taxation and public improvements.
The New York statute is quite a different
matter. It is the united voice of the sturdy
and earnest workers of the fields and ham
lets saying to the proud residents of the
greatest city in America: "You have de
parted from the honored ways of the
fathers. That Old World levity and dissi
pation which have struck rottenness to
the heart of European civilization have
sown t'-e seeds of decadence in you. While
this will react injuriously upon us, your
superciliousness and your contempt for
the bone and sinew of the State are griev
ously offensive. The yeoman calls upon
the aristocrat to halt."
Viewed in this light, which is largely
correct, even making allowance for the
city sentiment which supported the coun
tryman, the great city of New York now
occupies the most ridiculous attitude ever
held by an American metropolis. Even
its cherished free lunch on weekdays,
that most eloquent proof ol the mad rush
with which city people are wearing out their
lives in the pursuit of money," is sternly
withheld by the righteous farmer, and the
Raines Jaw informs the madmen of New
York City that they must go quietly and
in peace to a restaurant or stay hungry.
What will be the outcome of the law's
enforcement it is difficult to say, except
to remark in a general way that Jaws
which operate unequally and produce ab
surd results are never permanent. That
the people are taking the matter seriously
may be inferred from a recent decision of
the New York Court of Appeals, which
has gravely announced that the law does
not prohibit Sunday drinking in clubs.
The ground for the decision is that as each
member of the club is part owner of tbe
club's liquors, and as every man may drink
his own, a clubman is at liberty to drink
the club's liquors, and may or may not
leave propeity of other kindâ to wit,
moneyâ in the club's assets in lieu of that
which he has drunk. But the thins that
has turned the laugh of the whole country
upon New York City is that tbe farmers
of the State are regulating the personal
conduct of the city's residents. That is
surpassingly amusing.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
POPULISTS AS A FACTOR.
Recognized as a Living Force to Be Reck
i oned With in 1896.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sik:
Advices at hand from all parts of the greater
West and the Southâ not by telegraph, but by
the weekly journals of the partyâ indicate not
only great enthusiasm and harmony in the
Populist party, but a degree of confidence and
aggressiveness never before manifested. " The
proposed alliance with the Silverites receives
cordial consideration,' but it must be on candi
dates alone, tor there will be no surrender of
the principles which j constitute the Omaha
platform, though the money question in its
broadest American sense will be made the
fighting issue of the campaign, and the other
issues of their platform will be submitted to a
vote of the people as provided for in the reter
endum, in the same manner as this State sub
mitted the question to the people of an educa
tional Qualification of voters.
Direct legislation by the people will, beyond
a doubt, be incorporated in the next Populist
National platform, for the Populists have ac
cepted literally the watchword of the old
Roman republic, "Vox populi, vox dei," with all
its age-long significance, and with such patri
ots as Jefferson, Franklin, Paine and Lincoln
they believe in trusting the people, and hold
as immutable law to the declaration of the
founders of our Nation that "government de
rives it. just power from the consent of the
governed," and are unwilling to continue to
be governed by class laws made by corrupted
and bribed representatives at the behest of
the faVored and powerful classes, "as it is at
this day"; and they are determined to elim
inate the boss from politics, which will at once
be accomplished on the adoption of direct
legislation by the people.
Our old time politicians, who are just now
kept so busy mending the fences which the
political storms are prostrating all over the
country, may not reckon at it- full value such
an incident as the defection of ex-Governor
St. John of Kansas from the Prohibitionists to
the Populists, and they may have forgotten
that he was the strongest man who has led
their forlorn hope in twenty years, his vote as
Presidential candidate far exceeding that of
any Prohibition candidate before or since. He
will be attended by a large following into the
Populist party, and in strong Prohibition
States where Populists have already gained a
largo number of voters, some surprising re
sults may follow. â  <â â â â â.-"â 
In Oregon tbis year the Populists are united
and lull of enthusiasm, while the two old par
ties are in the throes of open di.se tions and
bitter animosities, which are not likely to be
quieted and healed during the campaign.
Similar misfortunes overtook the Populists at
the last election, whicb greatly diminished
tbeir vote, and this year they are likely to
profit by the condition of their opponents and
have a lair chance of carrying the State.
Looking eastward we discover evidences of
alarm at the growing influence of the Populist
party as a factor in National affairs. The New
York Sun, which has long been credited with
a high order oi political sagacity, has recently
said: "While the Republican party is visibly
stronger in the former doubtful States of the
Eastâ New York, Jersey and Connecticutâ
than it has been at any time for many years,
the success of the Republicans in their former
strongholds in the West is seriously threat
ened by the defection of the Populists, who
complicated by their action all the most con
fident prophesies made in 1892. The Demo
crats, too, are without any. enforced depend
ence upon doubtful States, east or west, this
year, and Illinois and Minnesota seem to prom
ise better results than New Jersey and Mary
land. The contest of 1896 at the conventions
will be a free-for-all one, as far as precedents
and past conditions will be involved."
It will be borne in mind that the Sun is a
prominent advocate of the gold standard of
values and decidedly inclined to discount the
influence of the Populist party.
The New York Herald, also for the gold
standard, devotes two columes to the Populists
and silverites, showing that the Populists made
larger gains two years ago in Congressional
districts, and avers that "the sliver men are
desperate," and declares that there is reason to
believe that "party lies will be torn asunder
by the white-metal men.at both the National
conventions." After giving details at treat
length of the votes in States favorable to silver,
politicians are iniormed that they can gain
"no adequate conception of the situation with
out a careful scrutiny of these details," and
recommends that they be "studied in the hope
of finding a sale path through the maze to vic
tory." .
The Boston Globe (goldite) likewise has dis
covered the existence of a live and vigorous
Populist party, so oiten pronounced dead and
all but forgotten, and after due consideration
of its claims as a National party, thus refers to
the political situation: "People who can see
beyond tbeir noses or out of the back of their
heads do no; trust any surface indication tiiat
DOW may seem to foreshadow a one-sided Presi
dential campaign ibis year, with an Inevitable
and easy victory for the Republican ticket at
the polls. To such a vision there are discern
ible not only many signs of a hard and doubt
ful struggle, but the experience of the past also
sounds a clear warning against the idea, some
what prevalent now, that an election for the
Presidency can go by default."
The Globe then proceeds to give some solid
reasons for making the ;oregoing statement,
reviewing at some length political statistics
which cannot be summarized within the
limits of this letter, but are so significant and
instructive that ail who take an interest in
the study of conditions which may within a
few months produce a radical change in the
political and economic administration of our
National affairs, will find it well worth while
to examine them in my next letter. In the
meantime the reader will observe that I have
not presented the hopeful views of silver men
and Populists, but those of the ablest goldite
journals of the country, to indicate the danger
which menaces the further domination of
goldites. Joseph Asbtjey Johnson/

a voice for Mckinley.
an Admirer of the" Ohio Statesman Eulogize.
His Services to the Republican Party.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
A good deal is being said against sending a
pledged delegation to the St. Louis Convention
in favor of the eminent Ohio statesman, Wil
liam McKinley. Why is it thus? When Gen
eral J. S. Clarkson ana Senator Andrews of
Pennsylvania were on the coast, ostensibly in
the interest of Allison and Quay, but evidently
more to prevent the nomination of Major
McKinley, they found to their surprise an
overwhelming sentiment in favor of the
Obioan in preference to. their favorites, and
therefore modified their schemes somewhat
and urged an unpledged delegation by the
State convention. They were also very lavish
and magnanimous in their promises what
their favorite candidates, if nominated and
elected, would do for the great West and for
the Pacific Coast particularly. Now I, as an
Ohio man, undertake to say that neither Alli
son, Quay or any other man can outdo Major
McKinley in magnanimity. McKinley is at
once the grandest man of the present day, the
peer of any man, pre-eminent in statesman
ship and forensic abilities, the prince of
honor, sublime in thought, true to every inter
est of all classes and all sections and the con
siderate friend of the working classes.
When some years since the McKinley law
became unpopular, even before it had a fair
trial, made so by pessimistic Democratic ora
tors throughout the entire country, Major Mc-
Kinley, like a true patriot, stood up and boldly
defended his measure with great ability, but
all the same went down In defeat and lost his
seat in the National Congress because ofthe
splendid energy he made in the country's be
half. It was McKinley that had to bear the
brunt and blame for all the dire calamity to
the Republican party. But since the country
has gone to ruin under Democratic rule, and
the McKinley protective system proven to be
the greatest measure ever enacted, and that
the country would have prospered beyond
measure under its operation, and beneficial in
the highest degree to the now distressed people,
those other gentlemen now come forward and
claim great credit for the passage of the Mc-
Kinley tariff law, and their friends, like Clark,
son, do their level best to undermine the great
Ohio candidate. Let me again say that in the
event of McKinley's nomination and election
to the Presidency he will fully recognize our
wants and he will not snub the Pacific States,
but will appoint one of our best men as a mem
ber of his Cabinet. The right of the Presidency
belongs to McKinley, and let the delegation
be pledged for him. J.B.Powell. â¢

A SONG OF THE CYCLE.
This is the toy, beyond Aladdin's dreaming,
The magic wheel upon whose hub is wound
All roads, although they reach the world around,
O'er Western plains or Orient deserts gleaming.
This is the skein, from which each day unravel
Such new delights, such witching flights, such
joys
Of bounding blood, of glad escape from noise
Such ventures, beggaring old Crusoe's travel.
It is as if some mighty necromancer.
At kind's command, to please his lady's whim.
Instilled such virtue in a rubber run,
And brought it forth as his triumphant answer. '
For wheresoe'er its shining spokes are fleeting.
Fair benefits spring upward :roni its tread.
And eyes grow bright, and cheeks all rosy red,
Responsive to the heart's ecstatic beating.
Thus youth and age, alike In healthful feeling,
And man and maid, who find their paths art-one,
Crown this ran- product of our century's "run,"
And sing the health, the joy, the grace of wheeling
Youth's Companion.

LADY'S BELTED WAIST.
A charming model for three fabrics is here
shown. It may be without the lining. -The
pattern is cut with the back In one piece. The
front is laid in a box-pleat on either side, it
opens at the top to show a plastron, from
which revers of the latest shape turn back.
The sleeves are particularly effective, made of
striped materials to show the folds at the top.
A white lawn with pink stripes would be ex
quisite, trimmed with white plastron and
revers trimmed with yellow valenciennes
Another charming way of making up striped
materials is to use the material crosswise for
the plastron, the stripes in the body being
used up and down.
A waist of blue colored heavy linen after
this model might have revers and plastron of
.white lawn.
Blue duck could be made very effective with
the revers and plastron in blue and white
striped or plain white duck.
For crepon or light wools the most stylish
and summer-like trimming is flax-colored crass
linen or batiste, which could be used for the
revers and plastron. These might be trimmed
with narrow Valenciennes luce or insertion
White batiste linen or lawn could be used
instead of the natural colored linen
Organdies or mulls can be made entirely of
the material, with an edge of narrow Valen
ciennes for a trimming. . ......

A' NATURAL TUNNEL.
! On the western shore of Angel Island, about
half way .between the steamer landing and the
fog-bell signal, is a most interesting natural
curiosity that it would be hard to find dupli

that goes directly through an enormous cliff.
The direction of the tunnel is from north to
south, or it could be seen from the Tiburon
ferry-boats. -rI.Y. Â. .. .;.-'-â¢/;
When viewed from a short distance the tun

feet high and at least thirty feet long. At high
tide it has about a foot of water in it, and
were it not for the rocks close to the entrances
could be entered with a bout.
When the tide is out the tunnel can be
traversed from end to end on foot, and a most
curious experience it is. The rocks in the pas
sage way are alive with crabs, and it is almost
impossible to avoid stepping on them. As tho
center of the tunnel is a little higher than
the ends it drains perfectly, so that it Is dry
except for a few puddles. *
The interior walls of the tunnel present a
curious appearance. They are of volcanic rock
and look as, if they were thrown into their
present shape when mixed with some softer
substance. This has since washed away, leav
ing the hole through the cliff. The rock
formation is exceedingly hard and in many
laces has a spongy appearance. It is almost
lack in color and very rough and jagged.
For its full length the tunnel is about the
same size, and is so straight it is hard to be
lieve that it is not the work of human nands.
In stormy weather the waves wash in and out of
the tunnel with great force, and wnen the
tide is high will entirely fill it, forcing the air
out with a loud, hissing noise.

ATTORNEY HAYNE
AND HIS RABBIT
The Ex-Judge Closes Every
Hole and Then He
Nabs Him.
IS THE LEASE INVALID?
Continuation of the Argument
in the Southern Pacific
Case.
SOME GOOD POINTS SCORED.
A Number of Cases Cited to Fix the
Range of a Corporation's
Rights and Powers.
Ex-Judge Hayne resumed his argument
oefore Judge McKenna of the United
States Circuit Court in the case of the
Southern Pacific Company against the
State Board of Railroad Commissioners
yesterday morning, occupying the entire
day. He devoted himself almost entirely
to the consideration of the lease of the
Central Pacific lines to the Southern Pa
cific Company. He contended the lease
was invalid and hence no lease at all, and
furthermore that one corporation could
not merge another into it without the con
sent of the power which brought both into
existence. This, he contended, had not
been done in the case at bar. The lease
could not be held to be a lease, but only a
business contract between two corpora
tions. '
In the afternoon Mr. Hayne resumed his
argument.
"In this case we are confronted by the
fact of an agreement," he said, "and that
agreement is to the effect that a division
of earnings was to be made between the
Central Pacific Railway and the Southern
Pacific Company, in virtue of which 6 per
cent of the latter's earnings should b
turned over to the former. Now the South
ern Pacific Company actually did the car
rying for which rates were charged. What
right, then, has the Southern Pacific Com
pany to share its earnings with the Central
Pacific?
"In the case of Richardson against
Drew, the court laid down the principle
that monopoly in trade or business is op
posed to the interests of the people. It is
called destructive alike to individual com
petition and prosperity. All combina
tions for cornering the necessaries of life
and arbitrarily fixing their prices are there
said to be a formidable menace to the pub
lic good.
"Likewise in the case of the State of Ohio
against the Standard Oil Company, it ap
pears from the opinion that monopolies
are to be generally regarded as opposed to
the spirit and letter of the common law.
A society having its own laws and rulers,
and having under its control commodities
or rights necessary to the well-being ofthe
public, cannot be upheld by the Law. This
was the principle which actuated the Su
preme Court of Ohio in striking down the
Standard Oil trust.
"It is one thing for the State to protect
the rights and properties of individuals or
corporations," continued Mr. Hayne,
quoting from a decision of the New York
Supreme Court in the North River sugar
trust, "but it is quite another matter for
courts to recognize, or much less create,
artificial privileges for persons or aggrega
tions of persons."
"Excuse me." interposed Mr. Garber,
"but does not the New YorK Supreme
Court in that case distinctly refrain from
deciding that the combination was ille
gal?"
"No, sir," retorted Mr. Hayne, hotly,
as he proceeded to read on; "can't you see
that the whole tone of the opinion is op
posed to monopolies?"
"Still," persisted Mr. Garber, "it seems
to me as though the court in that case re
fused in express terms to pronounce upon
the legality or illegality of the monopoly."
"Then why do they pronounce upon it.
as they do in the other part of the opinion ?
Why don't they say what they mean?
They ought to, anyhow."
Mr. Garber, by no means satisfied,
started to look up the decision quoted by
Mr. Hayne, ana having found it, one of
his associates started in to read it aloud.
"I protest against this interruption."
said Mr. Hayne. "If any one who may
wish can interrupt the argument, I shall
never get through. If the court wishes to
see the decision it can be read at any time
in private." ' '=â '": Jri
"You may proceed, Mr. Hayne," ob
served the Judge, with a half smile at the
attorney's impassioned plea for immunity
from interruption.
"In the case of the Texas Pacific Railway
against the Southern Pacific Railway,"
continued Mr. Hayne, ""a combination
for the purpose of strangling competition
was held to be adverse to the public good
and out of harmony with public policy.
There is a tendency among corporations,
even though they may hate each other, to
combine, where there is a prospect that by
so doing they may be able to corner the
public. This tendency is mischievous and
dangerous. Such combinations are in
themselves bad, and a menace to the pub
lic, even if not positively invalid. What- 1
ever may be done by such a combination,
whether good or evil, is not to betaken
into account by the court. The combina
tion itself is a bad thing, ana decided by
many courts to be opposed to the common
law."
"I would like to have a definite idea as
to the manner in which you regard this
contract between the two lines." inter-
I posed the Judge. "Do you call it a lease?"
i "I don't know what to call it," replied
! Mr. Hayne. "It is like nothing in the
heavens above, or the earth beneath or in
the waters under the earth. I don't see
why I should be the one to baptize such a
disguised service. It is a bad thing any
how and there is no salvation for it irre
! spective of baptism.
"Now the true rule in this matter is to
be found in the case of the Oregon Naviga
tion Company against Windsor."
"What were the facts in that case?" in
quired Mr. Garber.
"I haven't the case here," answered Mr.
Hayne, "but I know it lias some bearing
on this case. The decision is rendered by
Mr. Justice Bradley, whom I consider one
of the great Judges of the country."
"I am happy to concur with you on that
point," remarked Mr. Garber. "I refer
you understand, to your dictum in regard
to Justice Bradley."
"I am delighted to have your indorse
ment," rejoined Mr. Hayne, with a be
witching smile and a co'urtlv bow. He
then proceeded to quote a large number of
citations, all of which Mr. Garber carefully
noted down.
"In considering the points laid down in
these cases," he commented, "the court
must endeavor to penetrate all disguises
and subterfuges, and see the facts as they
are. If an act of a corporation be ultra
vires, and if this lease, or whatever it may
be called, be such an act, and furthermore
subversive of public policy, it ought to be
considered void under every respect.
Judge Sawyer has maintained that an act
ultra vires ; in the strict sense, that is to
say, without the range of the corporation's
powers, such an act is to be held absolutely
void. If any of the acts of the Southern
Pacific Company have been of this nature
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
they are and must be considered void.
This, however, does j not imply that the
great volume of business heretofore trans
acted under this contract should now be
ripped up and declared invalid. Tne law
may palliate and perhaps to some extent
legalize and revalidate what has been
done, but it cannot undertake to indorse
and ratify things to be done under this so
called lease in future."
Judge Garber here interposed to the
effect that Mr. Hayne was dealing prin
cipally on subtle refinements of legal
practice, and hinted that the point at
issue was being neglected. -
"You misjudge ; me," rejoined Hayne,
"but when I set out to catch a rabbit, I
always try to shut up all the holes. I've
got this rabbit pretty well cornered, and 1
want to close all possible avenues of escape
in order to catch him."
"And I want to catch my boat," quoth
Garber.
"It will take me only five minutes to
finish this point," pleaded Mr. Hayne.
"Yes, and it will take just five minutes
to make me lose my boat," said Mr. Garber
in no amiable tone"
"Court stands adjourned until 11 o'clock
to-morrow morning," said Judge Mc-
Kenna; and the rabbit remained at large.

TOP AND BOTTOM DICE
A Southern Pacific Employe
Easily Swindled Out of
His Money.
Instead of Being Part Owner of a
Store in Alaska He Is Mourn
ing the Loss cf $200.
An employe of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company living in Oakland, in
stead of finding himself part owner of a
store in Alaska is mourning the loss
of $200.
Last week his eye caught an advertise
ment in the Examiner, "Wanted, a part
ner to go to Alaska." He wrote to the
number given, and received a reply to
meet the advertiser at the Examiner bulle
tin board at a certain hour last Saturday.
He was there at the appointed hour and
a well-dressed young man accosted him,
introducing himself as the advertiser.
While they were talking another man
joined them, and the advertiser intro
duced him as his friend Mr. Howard.
The advertiser explained that he â¢ was
going to Alaska to open a general store,
and he wanted a partner who would have
to deposite $200 as his share of the stock to
be purchased. The Southern Pacific em
ploye was willing, and it was arranged
that he should bring the $200 with him on
Monday. yyy-
Monday morning the three again met
and they adjourned to Matt Kerr's saloon
on Leidesdorff and Halleck streets. They
had a few drinks, and the advertiser sug
gested a dice game. Howard took the
Southern Pacific man aside and explained
to him how easy it was to beat the game.
All he had to do was to bet on 21 both top
and bottom.
The bait took, and the Southern" Pacific
man put up his $200, which Howard took
possession of as stakeholder. The dice
was thrown and the Southern Pacific man
bet on 21. He was one too short, as 22 was
turned up, the dice having been fixed for
the occasion. Howard sneaked out of the
saloon with the $200, but the Southern
Pacific man held on to the other and
begged Kerr to send for a policeman.
Kerr refused, and after an hour's detention
the swindler succeeded in breaking away
from the clutches of his victim.
The police were notified yesterday morn
ing and Detective Anthony was detailed
on tne case. After making an investiga
tion a complaint was filed against Kerr
with the clerk of the Police Commission
ers, and he will be summoned to appear
before the board to-night to show cause
why his license snould not be revoked, the
police alleging that his saloon is a resort
lor "sharks" and gamblers.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Bay Pilots Have a Grievance
Against the Southern
Pacific.
RUN WITH UNLICENSED MEN.
Captain Spille of the German Bark
Altair Has Made an Innovation
on Discharging.
The German four-masted bark Altair is
one of the handsomest and best kept ves
sels in port. Captain D. J. Spille has been
on her since her maiden voyage and his
boast is that a better-found ship does not
sail the seas; the sailors are treated to
the same food that is served in the cabin,
and there was never a growl until the
master insisted upon the men helping in
the work of discharging. They did not
mind the work, but they did object to be
ing guyed by the longshoremen, who
thought it a good joke to see sailors doing
work that the stevedore was paid for do
ing. Captain Spille made his point, how
ever. He kept his men at work and the
stevedores' bill was just that much less.
Hitherto the object of every ship captain
has been to get his men to desert as soon
as the sails were furled. In future they
will be held aboard and the stevedores' bill
will be reduced to a minimum.
The Altair is a four-masted German
barK, but was built in England three Years
ago. She is 300 feet 8 inches lone, 42 feet
2 inches broad and 24 feet 8 inches deep.
She is owned by Boyes & Ruyter of Bre
men.
The bay pilots have a grievance against
the Southern Paeilic steamers, audit will
come to be heard before the Inspectors of
Hulls and Boilers to-day. Some time ago
Captain Steve Stevenson of the Modoc
was disrated, and A. Paul, who used to be
wheelsman'on the Stockton steamer Cap
tain "Weber, was put in his place. He had
only been three weeks on the Stockton
run and knew nothing about the Sacra
mento River, so Captain Fouratt refused
to accept him as a pilot. The agent of the
railroad's steamers was determined to have
him, however, so he was transferred to the
Apache. Now comes the trouble. The
law says the candidate for the position of
pilot must have been employed three years
on the river, and during the last year, at
least, continuously. Paul has not been
employed on the Sacramento at all. and
the Pilots' Association is determined to
have a thorough investigation of the mat
ter.
Hitherto they have been shuffled from
the Collector of the Port to the inspectors
and then back again, but now they intend
making a test "case. Once before Agent
White got the better of them by putting a
man named Carson on the Apache as
pilot. While the association members
were complaining, first to the Collector
and then to the inspectors, Carson got his
license from the latter and that settled the
matter. Now comes the tug of war.
Captain Weyman of the wrecked
schooner Ellwood is going to make an
other attempt in Alaskan waters. When
on a codfishing expedition the vessel went
on the rocks and was lost, and ever since
the genial skipper has been without a com
mand. He has now purchased the hull
of the tug Lena L, and is going to
turn her into a gasoline launch. She is
only a small craft, but Captain Weyman
thinks he will have no. difficulty in reach
ing Alaska with her. After* reaching
Resurrection Bay she will go into the
trading business, and as the captain has a
number of caches on Cooks Inlet he ex
pects to do well on the gold fields.
The yacht Coronet that is to take a party
of scientists to Japan to view the eclipse
of the sun will probably get away on Sat
urday. Six of her crew deserted at Sausa
lito, but there was no difficulty in replac
ing them. The men who ran away had
too much money coming to them after
their long trip around the Horn, and they
did not know any quicker method of get
ting rid of it than by deserting.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short

TO CUBE FOR THE CHILD
Little Theodore Marceau Will Be
in Miss Bennett's Cus
tody.
Both Parents May Visit the Boy When
ever They Please and Marceau
Will Pay Expenses.
For the present, at least, the custody of
Theodore Marceau Jr. has been decided
on. He will remain in the care of Miss
Emma Bennett, a trained nurse at the
Children's Hospital, he to stay at the hos
pital or anywhere within certain limits
she may see fit to take him, his parents
having at all times the right to visit him.
This method of disposing of what prom
ised to be a vexing question was the re
sult of a stipulation entered into be
fore court opened yesterday morning.
Mrs. Marceau and her attorneys, J. C.
Campbell; of Reddy, Campbell & Metson,
Garret McEnerney and F. H. Sh ort, and
Colonel Marceau with hisattorneys.Delmas
& Shortridge and ex-Judge Van R. Pater
son, were present, awaiting the coming of
Judge Slack, but before he ascended the
bench the attorneys all withdrew into the
Judge's chambers, and the spectators
waited another fifteen minutes.
At the end of that time Judge Slack
came, opened court and announced that in
the case of Marceau vs. Marceau the cus
tody of the child would lie awarded in pur
suance of a stipulation just entered into by
the attorneys in the case and which had
been dictated to the stenographer. The
clerk was ordered to enter the order ac
cordingly and the application for counsel
fees was then ordered put over for two
weeks.
The main case is still in the throes of a
compromise. The property question and
the charges against Mrs. Marceau are mat
ters upon which both parties can agree
amicably, but unon the custody of the
child there was always trouble.

RAISING THE BLAIRMORE.
Every Bidder Has His Own
Theory as to the Method
to Be Used.
THE CONTRACT NOT LET YET.
Shipping Men Are Creating a Fund for
the Relatives of the Drowned
>:b Men.
The fate of the British ship Blairmore is
still unsolved. Just who will attempt to
raise her has not been decided upon and
the five wreckers that put in bids are still
on the tenter hooks. All the parties con
cerned met in the office of Catton, Bell &
Co. yesterday afternoon and offers rang
ing from $22,000 to $30,000 were opened.
Who was the highest and who the lowest
Lloyd's agents refused to give out, but the
bidders were: A. Robertson, Bassett &
Bishop, Alex Campbell Bros., Healy, Tib
bitts & Co., The California Wrecking Com
pany and T. P. H. Whitelaw.
All the contractors were called in, one
after another, and questioned as to their
methods. Robertson will use pontoons if
he gets the job. Whitelaw would send
down divers and remove the ringing and
masts. After that the hull would be towed
into low water and put on an even keel.
The work of pumping her out would then
be comparatively easy. Healy, Tibbitts &
Co. would drive clusters of piles around
the ship and by placing cables under the
hull would raise it bodily. In order to be
sure of their premises the firm had a pile
driver out in Mission Bay yesterday test
ing the resisting power of the mud." The !
California Wrecking Company is backed i
by the Risdon Iron Works and the chances j
are that if they secure the contract the
work of raising will be done by tugs.
Nearly all the contractors stipulate that
they will raise and dock the ship within j
sixty days, but if they succeed inside of |
three months many an old sea captain will
be agreeably surprised. Strange to say, |
the bid of the Union Iron Works for the j
raising of the Earl of Dalhousie was I
$22,000, but then the company lost over I
$15,000 on the transaction.

STUFFED FOR TOE
LUST OF STUFFING
The Kelly-Mahoney Prim
ary Broke the Record
of Fraud.
ONE STUPENDOUS FARCE
Voters Were Three Hundred, but
the Votes Were Seven
Thousand.
,TWAS QUIET IN THE FOURTH.
The Shameless Pair Counted a Vote
Per Thirty Seconds With No
Voters in S'ght.
The farcical Kelly-Mahoney primary in
the Fourth Congressional District yester
day so transcended the stuffing record of
primary elections of any party in any city
that the stupendous fraud seemed to be
come an opera bouffe.
An aggregate of 300 legitimate votes, at
a liberal estimate, for the eleven assembly
districts were swelled to 7613. This was
done merely to give the election the ap
pearance of having been largely attended.
This was done, too, in the most open and
. nameless way ever exhibited by even such
conscienceless political tricksters as.Mar
tin Kelly and Jerry Mahoney, and the
arty riff-raff, on which they depend for
support alone with a few men of repute,
who through becoming soreheads or
through close friendship for Kelly and
Mahoney. to whom political debts are due,
have been induced to let these manipula
tors use their names.
The story of the primary yesterday in
the Forty-second District was about the
story of the day in all the districts. This
is a part of Mahoney's Senatorial district.
The polling-place on Taylor street pre
sented during the day a small Knot of men
aud two policemen, with occasionally a
voter coming and going. Mahoney had a
few of his boys around, and occasionally
they varied the monotony by picking out
a name from the register and voting again.
Ballots were dropped into the box by
haudfuls without the formality of tally
ing, and when the polls closed at 2 p. m.
not more than sixty votes were tallied ou
the tally-sheet.
Jerry Mahoney ordered about GOO votes
and when the polls closed the election
officers went to work on the two duplicate
tally-sheets and by rapid work just filled
out the big sheet with tallies opposite each
name.
When the first sheets were full they
simply took another, copied the ticket
down one side and filled out the oheet
with tally marks. This was done openly
in the presence of several witnesses.
The returns showed 631 votes cast.
There are 420 minutes in seven hours, and
the casting of 6SI legitimate ballots in
that time would have required one vote
every two-thirds of a minute.
This was the result at a polling-place to
which not thirty reputable Republicans of
the district came during the entire day,
end where the scene was throughout a
sleepy, listless one, with a few boys loaf
ing about and going to the corner occa
sionally for another beer.
These returns from Mahoney's district
were sent to headquarters, where they
were gravely received by Jerry and Martin
in the presence of others and slyly
chuckled over later.
In eacii of the eleven districts this story
was repeated. In the Twenty-eighth,
Kelly's district, the box was about filled
before 9 o'clock. Kelly didn't have much
money to buy beer, and he didn't even
scare up enough of a crowd to attract at
tention across the street. The few mem
bers of his old "push" who were on hand
voted in accordance with their pleasure
and industry. The Twenty-eighth re
turned 776 votes â nearly one for every
thirty seconds of the seven hours.
In the Thirty-second it was no trick at
at all for Jack Hoey to return 590 votes.
In the Forty-fifth Tom O'Brien hustled
about, trying to get a few real votes in,
but there was one record of two hours kept
when not even one voter appeared. The
Forty-fifth returned 613 votes.
These interested in the affairs of the
regular party primary of to-day did not
take enough interest in what was going on
to even watch the Keily-Mahonev prima
ries, and very few were impelled by curi
osity to visit any of the polling-places.
But then 7643 votes were returned, and
they fell to the districts, as follows:
Twenty-eighth District, 776; Twenty
ninth. 628; Thirtieth, Blo; Thirty-first, 804;
Thirty-second, 590; Thirty-third, 816;
Thirty-ninth, 942; Forty-second, 681;
Forty-third, 556; Forty-fourth, 322; Forty
fifth, ClB.
The total Estee vote of the Fourth Dis
trict was 11,034. The average vote to a
district according to Kelly and Mahoney's
returns was 095. This would be one vote
every three-fourths of a minute, and it
will be seen that in some districts a vote
every thirty seconds is recorded.
The primary election record of stuffing
and of falsifying returns was smashed to
smithereens yesterday. People last night
were amazed at the recklessness dis
played by such a record, which shows
stuffing for the mere lust of stuffing and
stuffing far beyond the criminal require
ments of a rump organization manipu
lated by two of the most infamous politi
cal parasites that have ever brought
shame to the Republican party in Kan
Francisco in the past.
These returns were taken to headquar
ters, where Kelly and Mahoney's alleged
Congressional committee â the one born at
midnight of two forged proxiesâ gravely
canvassed them in executive session. The
returns were formally approved and cre
dentials will be issued to the convention
delegates named on the tickets.
The primary, by the way, had another
odd feature. The ticket was a blanket one
and in all districts the nominees were
voted for. By this novel scheme each dele
gate will appear on the returns as having
received 7643 votes.
There was, of course, but one ticket in
each district and no opposition to any
body. Kelly and Mahoney had a hard job
making un their ticket in the first place,
scores of Republicans refusing to let their
names be used, and already there are signs
that many ofthe delegates" named will de
cline to act as delegates, finding Martin
Kelly and Jerry Mahoney more than they
can stomach even in politics.
it is by this gigantic fraud, shameless
methods and farcical proceeding that
Kelly and Mahoney are counting on being
able to deceive the ReDublicans of the
State at Sacramento, and by means of the
prestige, influence and little holds here
and there, which they would gain by even
a partial recognition, break into power in
San Francisco municipal politics.
Martin Kelly is too well remembered as
a Buckley Democrat until even Buckley
spurned him 3 ears ago and as the later
Republican bosslet who defeated Kstee to
receive distinguished consideration from
the Republicans of the State. Jerry Ma
honey lias clinging to him too large a pro
portion of the slimy mud from the depths
of local political corruption and is
too well known as a political trickster
who deals always' with Sara Rainey at
election time, and who is ever ready to
knife the rest of the Republican ticket in
the interest of- Mahoney to become a
favorite with the representatives of the
Republican party who will meet at Sacra
mento on May 5.
The Republicans of California are not
likely to be deceived by Martin Kelly and
Jerry Mahoney and their primary of yes
terday. _____________________________
A MARITIME REFORM.
Unique Suggestion Made With Refer
ence to Certificates for the Masters
of Sailing Vessels.
In a communication addressed to W. L.
Merry as president of the Chamber of
Commerce McNevin brothers call attention
to what they claim to be the general in- ,
competency of masters of sailing craft as |
compared with that of commanders of
steam vessels. As a remedy for this state
of affairs it is suggested that the Chamber
of Commerce in the plenary exercise of its
sound judgment, unaffected by either fear
or favor, nominate and appoint a most
critically selected Board of Examiners, j
practically and theoretica lly qualified as
experts and of fearless, unimpeachable j
integrity, whose sole exclusive duty should i
ba to pass upon the competency, tech
nically, mentally and morally, of sailing I
masters (despite the possession by them of j
navigation school certificates), who are ap- j
plicants for command of a vessel.
This communication further states that
''a certificate from such a source would be
more esteemed than one issued by a board
created by law, as such a board would
have some political or partisan taint about
it and politics and corruption have be
come convertible terms in these days."
EXPECT THE CONVENTION
Local Endeavorers Are Working
Hard for the Na
tional.
The Same Railroad Rates Can Be Se
cured as Were Prongs. d the
Republicans.
A strenuous effort will be made to secure
the Christian Endeavor convention of '97
for this City.
Rolla T. Watt, the energetic chairman
of the " '97 committee," appointed for that
purpose, said yesterday that he had every
reason to believe the same railroad rates
could be secured for the Endeavor conven
tion as had been offered the Republican â
$50 for the round trip from Chicago.
"Why not?" said he. "Won't we bring
more people here than the Republicans
could possibly have got together? It is
a business proposition."
The committee will soon issue an appeal j
; to the public for a guarantee of $20,000 for I
i the expenses of the convention, and ex
| pects a generous response from the citizens
who were so liberal in view of the hoped
| for political convention. At least three
halls must he rented, for it will be neces
| sary to hold parallel meetings. It will
require 15.000 chairs to seat the visiting
and local delegates. The expense of special
literature for the occasion will be heavy,
; and there is no doubt that the sum men
, tioned will scarcely cover the necessary
j expenditures. J ...ry
William Shaw, the treasurer and man
! of affairs of the World's Society of Chris
; tian Endeavor, will arrive from Tacoma
; Saturday and speaK in Oakland that even
j ing. On Sunday at 2p.m. he will address
I a big meeting at the auditorium of the
' Young Men's Christian Association. The |
' meeting will be under the auspices of the
'. Golden Gate Christian Endeavor Union.
. Mr. Shaw will be a guest at the Palace
Hotel during his stay in the City, which
! will be brief. He will go to San Jose on
j Monday and deliver an address in the
Garden City the same evening. He will
return to San Francisco on Tuesday and
leave that afternoon for Los Angeles.
Mr. Shaw's avowed purpose in visiting
the coast is to secure an interest in the
International Christian Endeavor Conven
tion to be held at Washington in July. He
I will, however, consider the advantages of
this City as a place of meeting for the next
National convention. Local Endeavorers
are organizing effective lines of action in
order to secure Mr. Shaw's recommenda
tion of this location. That gained they
feel that the remainder of the conquest
will be easy.
X-RAYS UNO BACILLI
Le Conte on the Importance of
Their Reported An
tagonism.
The Veteran Scientist Hopes That
the Germ-Destruction May
Be Possible.
"The only thing I have- to say with
regard to the reported destruction of
bacilli by the Chicago physicians," said
Dr. Joseph Le Conte to-day, "is that the
importance of the matter is so very great
that we can well afford to wait with sus
pended judgment until their results may
be further confirmed. Indeed, we may
sincerely hope that what they claim will
be wholly supported by competent author
ities.
"It may be very true that the X-rays
will destroy bacilli when they are inde
pendent of living tissue, as the experi
mentors in Chicago claim, but there the
question arises whether they can be killed
when in living tissue. The X-rays in de
stroying the bacilli and other disease
germs may also destroy the tissue in
which these germs are seated.
"The true effect which the rays will have
will, of course, come in time. Experi
ments along, this very same line have not
escaped the notice of the prominent physi
cians and scientists in France, Germany
and in New York. Numbers of them have
conducted tests of the effects of the X-ray
on bacilli, but all with negative results, so
far as is known, and hence positive results
must be reliable in the extreme to offset
these negative ones. I shall watch with
interest the developments in the case, real
izing the great importance which it will
have in the medical world if proved to be
a successful means of destroying bacilli in
living tissue. /.
--"I only hope that what Dr. Pratt and
Professor Wightman believe is possi
ble to be done with the ray in destroying
disease germs will prove to be a reality,
but certainly the evidence must be very
strong in its favor before the negative re
sults of other eminent scientific men can
be overthrown. This is all I have to say
in relation to the matter at the presant
time."
Court Vacation.
At a meeting of the San Francisco Bar Asso
ciation held on Friday, April 11,1890, the
following resolution regarding the court vaca
tion for this year was adopted:
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Bar
Association of San Francisco that the court
vacation commence on the Ist day of July and
end on the 15 th day of August.

AT THE POLLS

Primaries of This
Afternoon.
*~y
FIVE CONTESTS APPEAR
District Home Rule Will Make
Things Lively Here
and There.
.. . ,- i
THE OFFICERS AND NOMINEES, i
-
Names of Most of the Local Republi
cans Who Will Go to the State
Convention.
The party interest in the Republican
primary in both the Fourth and Fifth dis
tricts to-day is deep and keen, and a
heavy vote is promised.
The interest and activity that are dis
played in every district are proof of the
high spirit, confidence and vim with
which the Republicans here are entering
on a momentous Presidential campaign,
for the election to-day concerns solely the
selection of the eighteen delegates who
will represent California in the National
Convention at St. .Louis.
To represent the party in the work that
is to shape its destinies is a worthy ambi
tion, and one that is felt by many mem
bers of the party. Some wish the honor
for themselves, more are deeply interested
in seeing Republican clubs to which they
belong represented in the Suite conven
tion, and others are backing their friends
for the honorable goal. ";-*'yy
Out of this and this only has grown the
rivalry in some of the districts which will
result in opposing tickets being in the
field to-day. In a great majority of the
districts all elements have agreed upon
one ticket, men and organizations of large
district influence being given the
privilege of naming one or more of the
few who will make up the delegation.
In four or five districts rival tickets are
apt to be voted to-day, and these districts
will be especially lively between the hours
of 1 and 7 r. m. to-day.
There is seldom a trace of bitterness in
these contests, however.
They are rivalries that will not endure
when the later issues come to the front,
when tbe delegates to St. Louis have
named a Presidential candidate, and all
Republicans are out whooping for him to
gether.
The contests of to-day are one result of
the policy pursued by John O. Spreckels
and the Republican County Committee.
Mr. Spreckels has riser, above the petty,
tricks of scheming bosses and instituted a
party regime of fairness, equality and
honesty.
More than that, he has favored district
home rule, and has left district affairs to
be settled by the voters of the districts, in
terfering only in the way of endeavoring
to produce harmony. "
The County Committee has pursued the
same policy, and so any existing issues
will be settled fairly and squarely at the
polls to-day. The nominees who get the
most votes will no to Sacramento.
Yesterday the contests that seemed
likely to occur in the Thirty-fifth and
Thirty-sixth districts were settled.
There is a likelihood that two tickets
will be in the field in the Thirty- third,
Thirty-fourth, Thirty-seventh, Fortieth
and Thirty-ninth districts. In the Thirty
fourth Dawson Nichols is leading an op
position, and in the Thirty-ninth there is
opposition to the regular ticket from tbe
district club. ; .' ._
Leon Dennery, whose seat was declared
vacant in the County Committee on ac
count of non-residence, will hold a primary
of his own in that district to-day.

tion officers and nominees in the various

MOSS TAKES CHARGE.
The Traffic Manager of the Valley Road
in Harness.
John Moss, the recently appointed traffic
manager of the Valley road, assumed the
duties of his office yesterday, It is not
expected that the road will be ready for
business until the last of July. Some
freight might be carried at the present
time, but to undertake any transportation
work now would interfere with the prog
ress of the construction work. It is the
purpose of the new road not to undertake
to do any business until it is thoroughly
equipped and in position to handle it in an
expeditious and satisfactory manner.
It is all that the rolling-stock now in
service can do to keep the material moving
to the front as rapidly as it is needed, and
before any attempt is made to carry freieht
or passengers a considerable addition will
be made to the rolling-stock.
Although there will be no business to
look after for at least three months, Mr.
Moss will find his every hour occupied in
getting through the large amount of neces
sary preliminary detail work, such as
ascertaining what tariff schedules are re
quired, making up these schedules and de
vising the manifold blank forms required
in the railroad business. His headquarters
will be at the present offices of the Valley
road. . 'yy:- â¢'.''.-â¢
Central Pacific Officers Re-elected.
At the annual meeting of the stocKholders of
the Central Pacific Railroad Company all of
the old board of directors were re-elected
unanimously. They are as follows: Isaac L.
Requa, C. P. Huntington, William H. Mills, I.
E. Gates, C. E. Bretheiton, F. E. Spencer
and Charles P. Eells. Later the directors met
and re-elected all the former officers. These
are: Isaac L. Requa, president; C. P.Hunt
ington, vice-president; William H. Mills, sec
ond vice-president; I. E. Gates, third vice
president; W. M. Thompson, secretary and
auditor.
Out of the 672,755 shares of stock outstand
ing, 392,000 were voted, mostly by proxy.
Filled Cheese Seized.
William Vanderbllt. the State Dairy In
spector, has seized a quantity of filled cheese
aggregating in the neighborhood of 125
drums. Large quantities of oleomargarine
were seized at the same time in Los Angeles,
but this City Is reported to be entirely free
from the sale of this latter article.
Against Bituminous Pavement.
The Draymen and Teamsters' Union sent In
a protest to the Board of Supervisors yesterday
against the bituminizing of Market street.
The communication stated that a bituminous*
pavement was not calculated to facilitate the
work of the members of the union, and that a
committee would explain the matter at any
time the board desired.
The Ways of Authors.
Industry and perseverance, "an infinite
capacity for taking pains," ii they are not
indeed genius itself, as has been "paradox
ically said, form at least the indispens
able accompaniments to it. Mr. Rider
Haggard declares that he writes his books
simply by keeping at work on them. And
the industry of Mr. Rudyard Kipling may
be measured by the fact that he is said to
have written ""The Record of Badalla
Herodsfoot" seven times over, and then
to have made considerable corrections on
the proofs. The late Professor Huxley,
was another writer whose industry in per
fecting his literary expression was only
rivaled by his genius. :..
Strikingly contrasted with this necessity
for industry have been the pe:sonal in
clinations of some conspicuous writers.
Thackeray confessed that his besetting sin
was laziness he could , never write, he
said, till the printer's devil was at his
door. The story, again, is told of Dickens,
how once in a stationer's shop, he was
startled by hearing a lady at the counter
inquire whether the next number of a cer
tain novel, then appearing in monthly
parts, were out yet. Little -did the cus
tomer guess that the next part ofthe story
was not yet in existence, and that the gen
tleman at her elbow, in fact, stood there
for the purpose of buying the paper upon
which he in 1- tided' to go home and writ*
the chapter asked for.â Chambers' Journal.

It will be seen that no change is made in
either third or fourth class rates, and that
in all other cases there is a reduction rang
ing from 2 cents to 20 cents per 100 pounds.
In this connection it may be stated the
eastbound rates here quoted are also ap
plicable to the westbound, and it is in
these that the important changes are
made, as heretofore the westbound rates
have been considerably lower than the
eastbound.
All terminal class rates, it is understood,
are to be abolished. No details have yet
come to hand on the commodity rates
under which at least 75 per cent of the
westbound traffic is moved, and even a
larger percentage of the eastbound busi
ness comes under those rates. It was in
reference to the effect of these changes as
a whole that the statement was made in
The Call yesterday that there would be
an average advance of 25 per cent in all
transcontinental rates, and this assertion
is borne out by these latest developments.
These rates are considerable of a surprise
to those who have been led to believe for
several weeks that they would show a gen
eral advance.
All the roads which are members of the
new association are busily a. work prepar
ing their new schedules for the printer, and
it is expected that they will be ready for
distribution to allow the new rates to be

ROW OVER AN ELECTION
Trouble Over the Selection of
the Building Trades*
Agents.
How the Shinglers' Union May Be
Admitted Into the Central
Council.
The election of two walking delegates or
business Jagerits for the Building Trades
unions last evening, was productive of
anything but satisfactory results. Those
positions were held recently by R. T. Mc-
Ivor and H. M. Saunaers, with the under
standing that they should hold only until
permanent agents could be selected at a
general election by all -of the affiliated
unions. Last night the election was held
at 115 Turk street and a good, representa
tion was present. . ._.:%.
. The candidates were W. Danielson and
R. T. Mclvor of the Painters' Union, and
H. M. Saunders and C. F. Scbadt of the
Carpenters'. ' Although the position of
walking delegate is worth only $3 50 per
day at present, the election was extremely
exciting. The ballots were printed slips
bearing the heading of the Building
Trades Council, and spaces for two names.
After a series of wrangles the ballots were
called in and the announcement was
made that R. T. Mclvor and C. P. Schadt
had been duly elected. Then came a
rumpus. It was openly charged that the
sacredness of the ballot had been grossly
violated and that ballots had been
stuffed in by the handfull, the extra slips
having been received from the outside.
launders and his friends state that they
will appeal to- the council and to the
unions to have the election declared void
upon the ground of irregularity and fraud.
- The members of the building trades
unions are highly gratified over the action
of the Parrott estate people .in awarding
the contract of the finishing of the base
ment to union contractors. When the
strike ou the Parrott building was called
off last week Superintendent Stanford as
sured the representatives of the Building
Trades Council lhat Charles J. Bru.chke
would not be permitted to figure upon any
more contracts before his present contracts
are completed, and that the other contracts
in his line of work would be let before
Bruschke could get around to bid for more
work. Yesterday the bids for the base
ment were sent in, and the union people
are pleased that Stanford kept faith with
them. The contract will amount to about
$14,000.
The recently organized shinglers ap
plied to the Building Trades Council a few
weeks ago for admission as a union. The
council declined to seat the delegates at
once. It was claimed that the shinglers
have been performing, work that more
properly came under the head of car
pentering and it was desired to adjust the
differences between the two crafts in order
to avoid trouble and conflicts in the fu
ture, and the matter was referred to the
several carpenters' unions. Last evening
the subject was discussed in unions 483
and 304 and it was decided to recommend
the admission of the shinglers' union
into the council upon the agreement that
the shinglers will work only on the roofsâ
that is, that they will not do any repair
ing, laying of sheeting or shingles on the
side walls. It is believed that upon these
lines the two classes of workmen can labor
and not conflict with each other. Union
483 initiated fifteen new members last
evening. yy'
Within the past two weeks the question
has been discussed in the Building Trades
Council whether plasterers can put ma
terial on laths laid by non-union lathers.
This matter was discussed last evening
at the meeting of the Plasterers'
Union. A report was made from the
special committee from the Plasterers',
lathers' and hod-carriers' unions, which
met on Sunday. The committees decided
to make the following recommendations:
That no union plasterers shall cover non
union lathing: that no union lather shall
work for a non-union boss plasterer, and
that the union hod-carriers snail not carry
materials to any but union men. The
recommendations were satisfactory to the
Plasterers' Union. The lathers at their
meeting last night also adopted the
recommendations.
At the meeting of the Sandstone-cutters'
Union last evening the report was made
that the outlook. for better times is good.
Several large, buildings are about to be
erected and will" give employment for
nearly all the sandstone - cutters in the
city.
The Painters and Decorators' Union held
a long meeting last evening, and many
reports were made that the shops in this
City are gradually becoming unionized.
As an evidence that the painters' strike is
gradually drawing to an end was an action
declaring off the 50-cent per day assees
ment upon all working painters.
This assessment was levied when the
strike was at its height and when it was
decided that all painters at work in ''fair
shops" pay 50 cents a day into the strike
relief fund. While many worthy people
were relieved the committee was sadly im
posed upon by men who would rather
draw on the relief committee for money
than work. As the majority are now able
to find work the assessment was stepped.
Eighteen of St. Denis & Co.'s men were in
itiated.
The Amalgamated Woodworkers' Union
last evening initiated four new members.
At the meeting of the United Garment
Workers last evening nine applications for
membership were received. The union
will have a membership of 125 when these
are accepted.
Business Agent Saunders of the build
ing trades reports that Galloway & Town
ley's job, erecting a shed on the Howard
street wharf, is now fair. The contract
ors, he states, have promised to work the
men only eight hours, as required by law,
instead of nine, ns contemplated.
The Metal-roofers' Union went into per
manent organisation last night at 115
Turk street, and adopted a constitution
and by-laws. In the preliminary meeting
there were seventy-three roofers, and
forty-five more joined last evening. The
officers elected were: President, J. T. Mc-
Grath; vice-president, P. J. McDonald;
recording secretary, J. F. McGowan ; finan
cial secretary, F. Karr; serjeant-at-arms,
P. Dempsey ; financial committeeâ Charles

KEARNS SWORE FALSELY
Bonds That "Were Not Acceptable to
Acting: Police Jndge Groe
ziiiger.
Michael Kearns, who gave his address
as 443 Minna street, is quite likely to get
himself into trouble with the Police De
partment if he can be found. On Monday
evening he presented himself to acting
Police Judge Groezinger and offered to go
on the bond of James McNulty, who is
charged with killing John Harrington in
a Mission saloon on the 27th of last month.
He claimed to be the owner of a lot and
improvements on Castro and Sixteenth
streets, valued at $6000. Judge Groezinger
was not impressed with Kearns' appear
ance or his manner of answering questions
and refused to accept the bond after it had
been sworn to until he had consulted the
Assessor's books.
The property claimed by Kearns was
found to be in the name of another, and
the would-be bondsman was taxed with
having sworn falsely. He insisted that he
owned a house and lot in the locality men
tioned, but said he had forgotten its exact
location. Judge Groezinger said that he
would look the matter up. and if he found
that Kearns had sworn falsely he would
have him arrested for perjury. Kearns
then disappeared, and has not been seen
since, though a policeman has been in
dustriously searching for him.
After a Chinese Dragon.
Negotiations are reported to be in progress
by the Los Angeles Fiesta committee for ob
taining the 100-foot dragon used by the Chi
nese- of this part of the State in celebrating
occasions of unusual importance. The great
dragon is now at Marysville.

Mrs. Katz Declares That She Was Deserted by Her Husband Without Warning on
the First Anniversary of Their Wedding Day.
abandonment and the manner in which it
was done. Gustav A. Katz, a partner in
the California Market, abandoned his
pretty young wife and left her penniless
March 30, the first anniversary of their
happy wedded life.
Gustav ... Katz is one of four sons deft
by the late Fred Katz, the pioneer butcher
of the California Market. For four years
ho was engaged to Miss Lillian Schaffer,
one of the prettiest girls on Russian Hill.
There was opposition to the marriage in
both families, but March 30, 1895, the
young people were married and lived to
gether happily for exactly a year. Their
â â¢married life was without exceptional in
cident and entirely devoid of anything
that would suggest to the young wife any
such catastrophe as resulted.
They looked forward to their first anni
versary with pleasure, for Katz had prom
ised h:s wife that on that day she should
have an anniversary present in the form
of a beautiful piano.
On March 29, the day before the anni
versary, Katz acted in so singular a man
ner as to make his wife fear that his reason
was becoming unbalanced. For some in
explicable reason beseemed to be attacked
with the "blue.." The young wife sought
to make his surroundings more than usu
ally congenial, if such were possible, and
in the evening started to get supper.
Her husband went into the kitchen of
their home at 1516 Leavenworth street and,
seeing his wife busily engaged, was sud
aenly affected in such a manner that he
began to ween, and for about two' hours
this stalwart butcher wandered round the
house crying like a child. His wife begged
for some explanation, but could get none
whatever.
When they retired Katz continued cry
ing and moaning as if suffering the most
poignant mental anguish. His wife in
quired if he had trouble in his business or
with his people, and was answered in the
negative. After a short period he asked
her to turn on the gas, which was not
lighted.
"Why. you don't want to kill yourself,
do you?" she inquired.
"Yes," he replied; "I don't see any use
in living."
Of coarse Mrs. Katz refused to carry out
his request, but twice again during the
night he awoke and asked her to turn on
the gas that they might die together. Fear
ing that the husband beside her was losing
his mind, if not already a mental wreck,
Mrs. Katz remained awake all night,
though Katz slept at intervals.
In the morning the spasm of crying and
despondency seemed to have passed away.
Katz arose late and donned his best suit
of clothes. His wife inquired the reason
for this, and received the simple reply that
he felt like it. Besides this he took a
watch and chain he did not usually wear,
saying the watch needed cleaning and re
pairing. Then they sat down to break
fast, which passed off without interest,
and parted lovingly. Indeed, he paused
when halfway down the stairs and waited
for her to descend that he might kiss her
again ere they parted.
During the morning Mrs. Katz learned
to her astonishment from one of the boys
at work in the California Market that her
husband had not gone to his place of busi
ness. Terribly afraid that her husband
might have carried out the threat of sui
cide made the nignt before, she went to
the butcher-shop and found out what the
boy had said was true. The only explana
tion she could get was that her husband
had gone to the country. She went to the
jeweler's but Gus had not been there
either. None of his friends had seen any
thing of him. y'y
Then the young wife, half-crazed with
the idea that her husband had made away
with himself, went home. There she
found a telegram, signed in her husband's
name, _ saying: "Will not come home."
Going immediately to the telegraph office
she found that a man answering the de
scription of her husband had left the tele
gram. From that time, over two weeks
ago. she has been left without the slight
est clew to his whereabouts.
Whether he is alive or dead she does not
know; what excuse he can give for his
cruel desertion she cannot' tell. She has
been left without a dollar, though some
where or other her husband has at least
$10,000 hidden away. Her home is now
made with her parents at 1126 Filbert
street, but the most of her time is em
ployed in searching for the man who so
cruelly deserted her on the first anni
versary of their wedded life.
Mrs. Katz's attorneys. Messrs. Lane &
Lane, think Katz had thoroughly laid out
bis plan of desertion long before March
30. He is said to have inherited consider
able property from his father and to have
j transferred it to one of his brothers more
i than a month before he disappeared. Be
. sides, he sold out his interest in the shop
prior to his departure.
"The man wasn't crazy, in our judg
j ment," said Franklin K. Lane yesterday.
"That crying was" either stage business or
| weakness growing out of the knowledge
! that the next day he was going to forsake
: his wife. He didn't get up and turn on
j the gas himself, which shows quite clearly
! that he didn't want to kill himself. He
j simply asked her to do this.
"For a month, perhaps longer, Katz had
prepared to run away. He was properous
and hearty, but from his mother he had
large expectations, and she did not ap
prove of nis marriage. The poor girl has
been left in rather a bad position. She does
not want a divorce because she can't be con
vinced that the man meant to abandon
her.
"She has no money, though her hus
band, wherever he is," must have plenty.
.What a refinement of cruelty it was to de
sert her on the very day they had planned
to celebrate the endim: of the first year of
their married life! He had always pro
vided well for her, they spent every even
ing together, and she had no reason
throughout the year to believe that he
did not care for her to the exclusion of all
other women. Even when he was deeding
all his property and selling out his busi
ness so that he might leave her in absolute
want he appeared affectionate and consid
erate. It certainly is a cruel and brutal
way to treat a girl of 22."
It having been claimed that Katz was in
town and at home as late as yesterday
afternoon, a visit was made to the home of
Katz's mother and brothers late last night
to inquire whether or not the story was
authentic. The door was opened by a lad 3
who appeared to be his sister. The lady
was asked if Mr. Katz was at home. Her
answer was:
"We don't know where he is."
"A story is afloat to the effect that he
! has deserted his wife. Is this true?"
"It is perfectly true," was the answer.
i "Gus' actions are not supervised by us.
i He alone is responsible for what has oc-
c urred."
At this juncture the mother and two
;' brothers made their appearance. The
! mother also admitted the truth of the tale.
One of the brothers peremptorily ordered
! the rest to say nothing further.
In regard to the charge of affected in
sanity on the part of the wife, it is claimed
; by friends of Katz that there is another
! side to that story. His friends do not
1 deny the desertion, but assert thai he was
j led to do so by hi 3 wife's strange conduct.
TROUBLE OVER THE RELAY
The Bay City Wheelmen, Who
Finished First, Are Dis
qualified.
THEY REJECT THE DECISION.
The Packet Was Exchanged Too Soon
at the Sixth Stationâ Garden
City s Win.
The road-racing committee of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs sent word
to the Bay City Wht-elmen last night that
its relay team had been disqualified and
requested the return of th c trophy, which
will be awarded to the Garden City Cyclers,
that club having finished second in Sun
day's race.
The disqualification is for an alleged vi
olation of the racing rules, which provides
that the relay packet must be ex
changed at the finish of each relay
within a distance of 200 yards indicated
by two red flag". A protest was entered
with I. Percy Mills, referee at the end of
the sixth relay, claiming that the Bay City
man, Raynaud, handed the packet to
Vincent, who rode the seventh, before
reaching the first flag. The referee, who,
by the way, is a member of the Garden
City Club, allowed the protest, and as his
decision is final, the road-racing commit
tee had no choice bnt to disqualify the
Bay City Ciub.
Several ofthe judges at this station say
that the exchange was perfectly proper.
Raynaud, who rode the sixth, said last
night that . the first red flag was high up
on a water tank ana he had trouble seeing
it. Just as he passed this tank he handed
the packet to Vincent, who confirms this
statement.
F. H. Kerrigan, president, and Sanford
Plummer, captain of the Bay City Wheel
men, were seen by a Call reporter last
night, and both said that the club would
refuse to give up the relay cud until they
had had a hearing, which would probably
be at the next meeting of the associated
clubs in June. They seemed to care very
little about the cup itself, but felt that
snap judgment was being taken on them
and would refuse to submit without first
being heard. They claim the race on its
merits and don't propose to be "jockeyed"
out of it, ...
Chairman Stratton of the racing board
said that he had received the referee's re
port of the occurrence, which was in form,
and. the Bay City Club was disqualified in
consequence. If it refused to give up the
cup he did not know wi.at might be done,
lie had no feelings in the matter and
would only be guided by the rules. f
The trouble promises to brine about con
siderable feeling between the Bay City and
Garden City clubs, and also between the
Bay City and Acme Club of Oakland, as it
was an Acme man who filed the protest.
The end is not yet, and it is probable the
Olympics will be involved. The associa
tion will suffer by this internecine strife,
for the harmony among the big cycling
clubs has been considerably disturbed by
the recent relay race. -
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 1896.
A SATCHEL FOR A COFFIN
Newly Born Baby Boy Aban
doned by Its Inhuman
Parents.
WAS LEFT IN A VACANT LOT.
Its Life /Saved by the Fortunate Dis
covery of a Small Bay Tester,
day Morning.
By the merest chance a newly born
baby boy, abandoned by its inhuman
parents, was saved from death by suffo
cation yesterday morning.
About 7 o'clock Frank Swift, a boy liv
ing at 1111 Jessie street, was walking across
what is known as Potter's lot on Twelfth
street, between Mission and Market.
ln the southwest corner of the lot- near
the Twelfth-street fence, the boy's atten
tion was attracted by an old yellow hand
satchel. He lifted the satchel up and
shook it, then he whacked the bottom of
it with his open hand and was astonished
to hear a muffled cry.
The boy hastily opened the satchel and
gazed in astonishment upon a baby boy.
He left the satchel and ran down the
| street shouting "A baby found." The
J news quickly spread and Policeman Con
nolly heard of it and hurried to the vacant
lot, where a crowd of boys had gathered to
look at the baby.
Connolly carried his precious burden to
the Receiving Hospital, and Matron Kane
at once took possession of the infant. It
had been wrapped in an old newspaper
and towel and forced into the satchel,
which was shown by a large bruise on its
right hip and another bruise on one of its
heels. Its feet were also slightly frost
bitten.
Dr. Deil thought the baby could not
have been born more than an hour or two
before it was found by the boy, Swift. It
was well developed, with light "downy hair
and large blue eyes. Dr. Weil was "satis- '
fied from its appearance that neither a
physician nor nurse had been present at
its birth, and not a moment had been lost
in thrusting it into the satchel, which was
evidently intended to be its coffin.
The abandoned babe was sent in the !
ambulance to Mount St. Joseph's Orphan !
Asylum. The chances are that it will !
live, although for some time it was i
thought that it could not recover owing
to the exposure to the cold weather and !
want of air while shut up in the valise.
The police were notified, and Detective
Byrarn was detailed on the case with the !
object of finding the inhuman parents.
He has absolutely no clew to work upon.
The satchel is a common one such as
any one might use for carrying clothing, j
and the towel is an ordinary one. There
is a mark, however, upon it such as are J
made by Chinese laundrymen. As there
are hundreds of them in the City the
chance of finding the one who made the
mark is very remote, but if he could be
found it might lead to the identity of the
parents of the child.
Captain Lees received information last
night that may lead to the discovery of
the mother, and he detailed Detectives
Gibson and Wren to investigate.
JAS. BROWN'S FUNERAL.
Impressive Services in Grace Church
Attended by Crowds of Mourning
Friends.
Grace Church was filled yesterday with
friends of the late James N. Brown, whose
sudden demise occurred last Sunday. The
funeral procession left the family resi
dence on Bush street in time to reach the
church about 11 o'clock. The Rev. George
Walk of Trinity Church received there
mains at the door and read the impressive
burial service of the Protestant Episcopal
church.
Floral tributes of rarest beauty rested
upon the casket, which jvas borne into the
church by Perry Eyre, J. B. Lincoln,
Edward Lyre. F. W. Taliant, W. Bourne,
H. A. Williams. W. A. Heath and J. A.
Ruggles Jr. Following the casket came
the widow, led by her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Irving M. Scott. Mr. and Mrs. James
Brown, father and mother of the deceased,
with his two sisters, all in deepest mourn
ing, followed, after whom came a large
number ot more distant relatives and inti
mate friends.
The music was rendered by the vested
choir. Among the selections sung were:
Felton's burial anthem in F minor, Cardi
nal Newman's hymn, "Lead, Kindly
Light"; Weber's, "Softly Now the Light
of Day," and Sprague's, "Asleep in Jesus.''
The interment was at Laurel Hill Ceme

CHARGES- TWO FARES.
How Passengers Are Deceived on the
Solano-Street .Electric Line.
One of the worst inceptions yet in
flicted by the Market-street Railroad Com
pany on a confiding public is being per
petrated along Solano street, at the
Potrero.
The electric cars which go along Solano
street run from the Fillmore line to Ken
tucky, where they have their southern
terminus and where they connect with the
Kentucky-street cars. The latter run
from the Southern Pacific depot, at Fourth
| and Townsend to South San Francisco
| and at the depot they give transfers to
i Kearny street and North Beach.
Uninitiated visitors to Solano street who
| want to go downtown frequently enter the
j southbound cars, being decoyed to do so
by the names of the streets printed outside
I in letters which all who run can read. In
i every respect the Solano-street cars are
identical with the Kearny-street cars. In
print a foot long are written the words
"Third and Kearny," while the "head
lines" on the cars are "North Beach, S. P.
R. R. Depot, Sixteenth avenue, Powell
street and Kentucky street." There is not
a word about Solano street.
Now, why the Market-street company
should put the names of localities on a car
which does not go to those localities, or
even transfer to them, is a problem which
can only be explained on "the grounds of
its desire to harvest a few more dimes by
gulling the public. y-yy.y^y-Y.
The passenger to North Beach, or Kear
ney street, finds when he reaches Ken
tucky street that he is at the terminus of
the Solano-street cars. Transfers are
offered him to South San Francisco,. but
transfers going citywards are refused. The
passenger can only reach Kearny street
and the other places indicated on the So
lano-street car by paying another fare. The
same rule holds good in going the other
way.
At this rate a company can hold out all
sorts of inducements to passengers in the
way of taking tnem to remote places, and
when they are once on board and have
paid their fares it can turn round on them
and say, "You can get there, yes by pay
ing another fare."
Scbutz'a Troubles.
Albert Bchutz, ex-superintendent of the
Salem Cemetery, San Mateo County, had a
charge of maliciously procuring, a warrant of
arrest booked against him at the City Prison.
Schuiz has been in the prison for several days,
as he could not procure bonds to keep the peace
toward his wife. Mrs. Scbutz's attorney heard
that Judge Low intended to release ochutz.and
she swore out a warrant against him for hav
ing her arrested on a trumped-up charge that
she was insane.

PRESBYTERY IN SESSION.
1 The Annual Convocation Meets
at Memorial Church, South
San Francisco.
TWO JAPANESE ORDAINED.
Rev. J. S. Kennedy Succeeds Donald
M. Ross as Moderator for the
Ensuing Year.
The San Francisco Presbytery of the
Presbyterian denomination is holding its
annual session at Memorial Church, South
San Francisco.
. The Rev. Donald M. Ross, moderator,
opened the session with a short sermon
and prayer, which was followed by a
prayer from Joseph Woodworth.
Moderator Ross stated that the first busi
ness of the session was the election of his
successor as moderator of the San Fran
cisco Presbytery for the ensuing year.
The Rev. F. R. Farrand of Howard
Church was placed in nomination, and
there being none other wishing to dispute
the honors of presiding over the clerical
body, he was elected by acclamation. For
the office of temporary secretary, Rev. S.
J. Kennedy was honored in a similar man
ner, there being no opposition.
A communication from the presbytery
at Puget Sound stating that the Rev. S. J.
Kennedy nad withdrawn from that body
with the intention of taking up his resi
dence ir this City an d recommending him
to the presbytery here was read and Mr.
Kennedy was received into full fellowship.
Takenasoke Okuno and J. K. Inazawa,
two young Japanese, were ordained as
evangelists by the presbytery for foreign
missions. The ceremony of ordination
was performed by the Rev. Dr. H. C.
Minton of the Theological Seminary, San
Anselmo, who preached the sermon, and
the Rev. Dr. Condit gave the charge to
the young ministers, alter which Dr. Min
ton offered the ordination prayer.
There were examined and" licensed to
j preach the Gospel: Archibald J. Ross, T.
i Okuno and W. H. Layson. Charles R.
j Callender, a young licentiate from the
I presbytery of San Jose, was accepted into
I the San Francisco presbytery on a trans
| fer.- He will receive his ordination in the
I near future. : .-.._â  ''-*â â â¢
On the motion of the Rev. Dr. John
Hemphill of Calvary Church the Rev. J.
Crosbie, president of the Tamafpias Train
ing School was accorded the privilege of
the presbytery to impress upon members
the necessity of encouraging : and main
taining the school at San Rafael, where
young aspirants' for ministerial duties
would receive a proper education.
The session assigned the Rev. R. W.
Reynolds to the charge of Holly Park
Church, in the Western Addition, to which
church he has been called, and from the
accounts received of him the Western Ad
dition people will have a live minister in
their midst. ;y

Juniata County, Pa. While teaching school
in Lake County, in this State, he became
converted, and in 1889 he returned East
and took his collegiate course at Black
burn -University, in Illinois. He entered
the San Francisco Theological Seminary

routine business the presbytery adjournod

French and Italian missionaries will be
taken up for discussion.
AIL IN ONE CONTRACT.
The Manner of Reconstructing the New
City Hall Roof Decided.
The City Hall Commissioners decided
two important matters yesterday, one be
ing the question of letting the contract for
putting on the new roof of the hall as a
whole or in separate portions, and the
other the new elevator requested by the
Trustees of the Public Library. City and
County Attorney Creswell moved that one
contract be made for the construction of
the roof, claiming that in case of damages
to the furnishings of the hall, the respon
sibility could be easier fixed under one
contract. II c was opposed by the Mayor,
who said that the laborers who worked on
the roof would derive greater benefits if
the work was divided into three or four
contracts according to the trades repre
sented. Auditor .Broderick voted with
Mr. Creswell, and the attorney's plan car
ried. Clerk McCarthy was instructed to
advertise for bids for the work, which
must be finished by December 26 next.
The matter of giving the Public Library
an elevator to obviate the climbing of the
tortuous stairway, which the patrons are
now compelled to use, was then discussed,
and it was decided to let a contract for an
electric lift to be finished by October 1.
Architect Shea stated to the commission
that he had been planning a directory for
the hall, and had figured that it would cost
about $00 complete. He contemplated
numbering all cf the various courtrooms
and offices and placing plans at all the
entrances on the first floor.
City and County Attorney Creswell
brought up a proposition to tear down the
square tower on the City Hall avenue side
ot the hall, northeast, of the dome, but
both the Mayor and the Auditor took the
! view that it was the duty of the commis
sion to build up and not tear down the
j hall, and the proposition was not carried
j out.

DAY'S WORK OF CONFERENCE
Yesterday's Session Largely Attended.
Rev. William Rader Delivers
an Eloquent Address.
The committee on credentials of the Bay i
Conference, in session at Berkeley, yester- |
day added another coat of whitewash to j
that in which Dr. C. 0. Brown enveloped
himself immediately after the ecclesiasti
cal council found him guilty of sundry
nnministerial nets. The report, on motion j
of Dr. McLean, was formally accepted, but |
further action was postponed until next
Tuesday.
The peculiar action of the committee in |
declaring that it had no jurisdiction over
the case of Pastor Brown was generally
condemned by those who claim to be
fully conversant with Congregational I
rules. Drs. McLean, Mooar and Rev. Mr.
Rader were outspoken in censuring what :
they termed "unwarranted proceedings."
Dr. Brown himself did not seem to be par
ticularly overwhelmed with the fact that i
the committee on credentials, under the
able guidance of Deacon I. 11. Morse, had ;
rendered him a valuable service iv that it I
gives him an additional week to build new
fences.
This committee met yesterday at 10 j
o'clock and for four hours wrestled with
the Brown case. The result of these
earnest labors will be seen in the remark
able document printed elsewhere.
The First Congregational Church of J
Berkeley presented very much the ap
pearance of the First Church of this Citj |
during the days of the council. When
Moderator Goodall rapped for order many j
familiar faces were to be seen. On the
right side sat Mrs. Cooper, Miss Cooper, !
Mr. ami Mr*, George Gaden and Mr. am. â¢
Mrs. K. A. Tuttle.
On the right of the main entrance Dr.
Brown's friends gathered in great num
bers. The pastor occupied the fourth seat ;
from the front. Mrs. Mac Davis and Mr.
Jacques being his particular companion.. \
The pastor's wife sat just in front of her
husband and near her was to be seen Miss
Havens, the young lady, to whom Mrs. !
Brown is said to have confided her home
troubles. Just back of the pastor were:
Mrs. Rogers and Miss Freeman. Alto- j
gether Dr. Brown had some forty of his j
1. . i;. friends present to assist him should j
the occasion demand it.
The first session of the conference
opened in the afternoon with Professor .1. j
H. Goodell of the Pacific Theological Sem- ]
mary presiding as moderator.
Rev. George li. Hatch of Berkeley acted !
as registrar, and, with Rev. W. D. Wil
liams of San Francisco, had charge of the j
arrangements.
The Cooper Congregational Church of
San Francisco sent duly appointed dele
gates, who were recognized by the confer
ence.
Rev. E. S. Chapman of Oakland dis- i
played his "sanitary communion cup" j
and explained its use at length.
Reports from churches represented in
the conference were received. For the
First Congregational Church of this City
it was announced that during the past few
weeks Dr. Brown's church has been well
filled. The Christian Endeavor Society
and Sabbath-school were growing satis
factorily. Attendance at service was large
nnd great interest prevailed in what took
place. About twenty persons will join the
church next communion on confession of
faith. .--
Favorable accounts were given by dele
gates from the Plymouth, Third, Fourth,
Bethany, Olivet, Eighth, Park, Richmond,
Bethlehem. Pierce-street, San Rafael, Sau
salito, Sunol Glen and Swedish churches.
The committee on credentials, through
Rev. W. W. Scudder of Alameda, recom
mended thai Fruitvale, Mill Valley, H
street and Ninth avenue, San Francisco,
churches be received into the conference.
The recommendation was adopted.
J. Kimball, A. R. Sheriff and A. Wil
liams were added to the roll, and with
William Rader, B. Boyer, (J. Gam and O.
c. May were made members of the con
ference.
Rev. Mr. Halleck of Tacoma was present
and received an invitation to sit with the
conference.
The report of the committee on creden
tials was read by Rev. Mr. Scudder. It
contained a resume of the unsavory
Brown-Davidson-Overman case and the
findings of the council, as published in
The Cm.:., besides some new matter as
follows:
Your committee ask leave to present a report
concerning the case of the Rev. C. O. Brown,
D.D. The matter was formally referred to the
committee by the following communication:
â  To Revs. W. it. Scudder, F. 11. Foster, Walter
Frear, Caleb Sadler. I. 11. Morse, Committee' on :
Credential* of Ban Conference of Congregational
Churches and Ministersâ Draii Brethren; The
undersigned desire to bring to your notice, iv
manner according with the rules of tbe con
ference, the action of The late council called
by tho First Congregational Church of San
J rancUco to consider the charges made against
their pastor. Rev. C. O. Brown, and also the
treatment accorded to the findings of that
'â¢ouncil by the said church and its pastor; and
re ask yon *o consider the bearings which
fiose findings and this action, or neglect of
nction.on. the part of said church, and their
hale! pastor should have upon their standing m
the Bay Conference.
Also we wish to cad to your attention the
action of the Rev. C. O. Brown as alleged in
the public prints, in thai he is said to have
dictated or suffered to be dictated
Mad sent a telegraphic message through
the United Press to the effect that i.e.
the -lev. CO. Brown, had been fully vindica
ted on all charges made or presented lot he
ecclesiastical council, whose verdict was, in
nls hands, and further, that ha afterward de
nied the dictating or "-ending or allowing of
Mich dispatch, contrary to the sworn affidavit
of the San Francisco agent ot said United
lV: . These being matters of public interest
Mid Information, the mention of them In thts
way is supposed to meet all requirements of
the phrase "specific charges" used in article
seventh, section two of our constitution, and
weaak you, brethren ofthe committee, to con
sider all the matters herein mentioned, and to
report to the conference at the next meeting
what action, if any, the conference should
take with reference io them.
J. K. McLean.
S. M. I RKKJ.AND,
J. 1.. Barker,
James M. Haven.
The art icle In the constitution referred to, so
lar as it bears on the case, is as follows:
"When the standing of a minister or a
church is called in question it shall be the
<:,:!>â¢ of this committee (on credentials to en
tertain specific charges from responsible per
sons) to inquire into the case, end to report to
the conference, which shall then proceed ac
cording to scriptural method and extent."
In the above communication lour points are
brought before us for report:
First -Have the findings of the council im
paired Dr. Brown's standing in the Bay Con
ference?
Secondâ lias the treatment of those findings
i on the part of the First Congregational Church
<â¢: Ban Francisco impaired the church's stand
ing in the Bay Conference?
Thirdâ Has Dr. Brown's treatment of those
, findings Impaired his standing in the Hay
j Conference? . y 'â 'â â  -â¢ - ''â â _ __ yYY
i Fourthâ Dr. Brown send, or cause or al
' tow to be sent, a certain United Press telegram
announcing his complete vindication on nil
i charges presented to paid council, and after
ward deny such action or agency?
Tho iirst three points are technical in chp.r
--i r.eter and are concerned chiefly with the state
i ments contained in the flndlngsol the council.
Here follows the (hillings of the council. The
committee then went on to say that tlicy were
j in practically the same position as that of the
! council. They were not called upon to in
quire into the pastoral relations of Or. Brown
j â to the First Church. The committee takes up
| each charge. The report further said:
As to whether the treatment of these findings
on the part of the church has impaired that
church's standing In the Bay Conference, we
report that, since the council advised no defi
nite line of action to the church and the
Church accepted the findings, and they are
spread in full on the minutes of the church,
would be difficult to find in this any cause
i for censure. This is all that Congregational
i usage requires of a church, if it requires thai
i much. As to any seeming discourtesy toward
| the council's deliverancesâ and we have not
j discovered that anything of the sort was in
; tendedâ we should not forget what the council
â â  has called "the painful and divided conditions
! in which this experience has left this loved
and honored church." With this in mind, we
believe that nothing has occurred of sufficient
significance to warrant the grave charge of a
breach of fellowship on the part that church.
In any event, it is the duty of this conference
to be very patient with Â« sister Church of large
and somewhat distracted membership strug
gling with complex problems of readjustment.
(c) Has Dr. Brown's treatment of those find
ings Impaired his standing in the Hay Confer
ence? Here, again, there was no definite
recommendation of the council for him to
transgress. His effort to escape the force of
the censure seems to us not commendable.
That lie Should criticize the verdict is perhaps
no more than natural. That he should pub
licly repudiate the rebuke Is, of course, to step
on dangerous ground. If Dr. Brown was dis
courteous toward the findings of the council,
which he himself disclaims, either on grounds
that to him seemed justifiable, or otherwise,
\ as may be implied in the communication sent
to us, we have no evidence that what occurred
was of sufficiently grave importance to serve
as a reason for the withdrawal of fellowship
by the conference.
The fourth point presented by the letter in
volving an accusation of untruthfulness on
the part of Dr. Brown the committee fell to be
a very serious matter. The suggestion, how
ever, that since it was "alleged in the public
prints" the committee should investigate it,
seemed to us a dangerous innovation, and one
that exceeded our powers. The committee is
not charged with this duty Dy the constitution
of the conference. * * Â«* The committee
therefore communicated with the complain
ants, requesting them to formulate "specific
charges.* * * * In reply to this the com
mittee received the following letter:
Oakland. Cat., April 7.
Professor Frank If. Foster, 50, Thirty-fourth street,
Oakland, Vol. âMy Dkak jsir: Please accept,
thanks lor communicating the tact that notice lias
been taken ot a paper which I had the honor of
sending to the committee on standing of churches
and ministers in lie Bay Conference in behalf of
a certain gentleman interested. In respect to th ? In
t vitation given to one or ail of us to present formal
charges and proofs before the committee on Fri
day. April 10, you will allow me to say that the
gentlemen with whom my name Is associated in
the papers presented to your committee do nat re
gard themselves as standing in the light of pros
ecutors demanding the right to bring proofs. * * *
The Bay Conference has a standing committee for
this purpose, If in their Judgment th- reputation
of the body which they represent, or that of Dr.
Brown, one of its members, is in no wise affected
by the publications referred to, it is their duty to
say so. li has seemed otherwise to us and we
have suggested inquiry on your part. With great
respect, yours truly, S. M. Frkeund.
We infer from this communication that the
complainants decline to take ihe responsibility
i of proving the charges or rumors to which they
j call our attention. Since, therefore, it Is not
! the province of this committee to disprove the
i allegations of public prints, or to be charge
i able for their correctness or falsity, we could
do no more in this matter than to' report the
situation to the conference, and await your ac-
I tion. The committee has not the slightest de
-1 sire to act as an obstruction to the full inves
i tigation of all matters affecting the integrity
loi any members of the conference. * * * if
I no person or perrons are willing to take the
responsibility of procuring such evidence the
conference might appoint a special commis
sion, whose duty it shall be to present the
I matter in due form to the committee on ere
; dentials. Meanwhile, that committee believe
\ themselves to have gone to their lull extent of
. their constitutional powers. * * *
ft seems somewhat important that the com
mittee should state for the consideration of t he.
council what seems to them the correct jim
! tion in respect to the functions of a commits ;
I on credentials. These functions seem lobe judi- j
; cial. The committee, in the language ol the
j constitution, is to "entertain specific charges
| from responsible persons." Such specific
I charges are necessary that the committee may
i know into what it has to Inquire and that the
accused person may know what he has to dis
prove or confess. They are to be from responsi
i ble persons; that is, persons who are bound to
i answer or respond in case a wrong should oc
! cur. That is, in particular, in case they have
, falsely or upon Insufficient ground accused any
i one. They must, therefore, take upon them j
I the responsibility of proving the charges which
I they present.
When all this is done, when there are
I definite charges and responsible complainants.
then and not till then, it is the duty of the
committee "to inquire into the case," and that
inquiry is essentially a judicial Inquiry in its
nature. * * * In view therefore of the diffi
culties with which both council and conference
have been troubled, and in default of the evi
dence which we have invited, unless the con
ference decides to take further action along
the lines indicated in this report, the only ad
vice that this committee can give is that for
the present this matter be allowed to rest,
awaiting the action of the church, in whose
hands, according to the principles of Congre
gationalism, lie the amplest and most effective
powers of adjusting ull difficulties that now
distress it. Caleb Sadler.

Dr. McLean moved that consideration of
the report be postponed to an adjourned
meeting of the conference, the date and
place to be fixed later. yY-y-y
"I would like to state," he said, "that
this matter relates to an exceedingly im
portant question in which the interests of
not only one man and one church but of
all Christian people and all denominations
are involved."
"Hear! hear!" came from a delegate.
"It would be impossible to do justice
now to this report," continued Dr. Mc-
Lean. "We are here as guests and it
seems unmeet, therefore, that we should
take up consideration of the report at this
conference."
"I move that Dr. McLean's motion be
laid on the table," said J. D. Foster of
Lorin. This was promptly seconded, and
the chair declared the motion debatable.
"I believed it is not debatable," said Dr.
Brown.
"Do you wish to appeal from the deci
sion of the chair, Dr. Drown?" asked the
moderator.
"I believe it is not debatable, but I want
to take, advantage of the opportunity to
say a word. 1â...I â ...
"Then I appeal from the decision of the i
chair," eagerly interrupted the Key. Mr.
Hatch."
The chair was not sustained by a vote of
31 to 31, and debate was declared not in
ortfer. The motion to lay on the table
was lost. >yy-y'-
This did not please Foster. "I can't see
what possible good can be gained by re
considering this matter," lie protested.
"The churches are sick and tired oi it. and
if the council, after spending a month,
ended in doing nothing it seems folly to
prolong this."
Dr. McLean's motion was carried and
the conference determined toadiourn until
next Tuesday at 9:30 a. m. in Market
street Congregational Church. Oakland,
for reconsideration of what was termed
"this Brown matter."
Dr. Brown and his friends left the con
ference immediately, and all sang "Nearer,
Mv God, to Thee." â â yyy
W. W. Lovejov spoke on "Mythical Ele
ments in the Bible," and T. li. Bacon on
"The World's Peace," after which a recess
was taken until evening.
At the evening session Rev. William

WANTED HER TO COME TO HIM
The Plaintiff's Deposition in the Case
Ready to Be Brought Into
Court.
"I send you a thousand kisses," wrote
Lucky Baldwin to his lady friend in the
East, and then he went on to describe how
very much he longed for her to come to
California to return them.
The letter was sent to Miss Lillian Ash
ley, who was then at school near Boston. It
was in 1891 and she was then 22. Now
she is 27 and the plaintiff in a suit for se
duction, in which she demands $75,000
damages for herself and the support of
her child. Baldwin is the defendant m
the suit.
Baldwin had seen the young woman at
her home in the East and had, she says,
made promises to her which opened out
a golden future. She was to go to school,
to the best colleges the surrounding coun
try could offer, and all at his expense. She
was to wear hue clothes and have money
in her pocket, and when she had grown a
little bit more she was to come West and
be his daughter.
Two years after saw her on her way
coastward. There was money in her
pocket and hope in her Heart, and she was
going to see "Lucky," who had sent her so
many kisses and who wanted them all re
turned with interest. Her way was punc
tuated with telegrams. "Be sure you look
for me." said one. "I will be waiting for
you," breathed another. "You must come
right to the Baldwin Hotel," whispered a
third, and so, with the bits of yellow paper
in her pocket, she came westward, carry
ing the thousand kisses.
"â¢Lucky" Baldwin couldn't meet her as
he promised. An unsympathetic telegram
told her that when she was near Tucson,
but it added the cheerful news that she
was to go to the Baldwin Hotel anyway,
and he would see lier there.
She did go to the Baldwin Hotel and to
San Diego and to Coronado and to the
Santa Anna ranch, and she had horses
and carriages at her disposal whenever she
pleased, and her brother was given em
ployment when she sent for him to come
out, and everything went along too
smoothly to last.
Then "she told her brother what had
happened. Both were opposed to make a
bad matter worse, so nothing was said
until the case got too far for concealment.
Then she wrote and asked for assistance.
Then she pleaded, and now she is bring
ing suit. The child was born in Los
Angeles on December 7, 1883.
This is Miss Ashley's story of the case
as set forth in her deposition which lias
recently arrived from where she is stay
ing in Southern California.
"IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS"
Dr. Levingston Explains His
Understanding of Mr.
Knight's Words.
Charley Fair Is Playing for Time
With the B.st Wishes of
His Sisters.
Dr. Marc Levingston, glancing yesterday
over tne last reported proceedings in court
in the Fair will case, was apparently much
amused.
"George Knight, I s*e, has informed the
court that the change of front is not as
serious as it appears," said tbe doctor.
"Mr. Knight is wrong about it. It is just
as serious as it appearsâ to us at
least. For it neither is nor ap
pears serious at all. On the contrary
it is the most arrant and transparent trif
ling with the dignity and majesty of the
law and the court. Mr. Knight is simply
playing for time. He says that Charley
Fair and himself have become convinced
that the will of the 24th, which they lately
declared to be the only genuine will, is,
instead, a rank forgery. " He says that he
has such abundant proof of it that be will
not only prove it to the satisfaction of the
court, but will convince me or my attor
neys. If that be true why cannot they try
it on tbe other heirs, the Fair sisters, and
having convinced them, array the united
army of lawyers against this later will?
"Hitherto the heirs have been one in
their contest. It is not to be supposed
that Charley Fair is concealing the facts
about the pencil will from his sisters; that
he has entered upon a serious contest of j
the will a"lone by his own choice. It',
then, they know all that be knows about
the pencil will, it appear, that the facts
have not been sufficient to convince them
that it is a forgery, and they stand out
and refuse to contest. Last Friday, in
deed, they filed a demurrer to the contest 'â 
of this will setup by Van K. Paterson on
behalf of Herman Oelrichs Jr., which in
effect gives distinct notice that they still
stand on this will.
"What does it ail mean then? Has
Charley Fair broken with his sisters, after
having taken chances on that disinherit
ance clause of the earlier will? Has be
entered a serious contest of the later
will that was his hope and anchor, and
this on evidence that all the others refuse
to accept? Is that likely?"
"No; Mr. Knight has said it is not se
rious. It is quite plain to me that this is
all prearranged â mere play upon the
boards, determined upon after weeks of
consultation between all the parties. It is
an extravagant. I may say, grotesque,
position for client and lawyers to take,
but, as I say, it was determined | upon
after the utmost deliberation as the only
thing to be done in their desperate straits.
"This is the reason for it. These people
have determined to keep in position to
make the best of either will. What they
objected to in the eariier will was the trust
clause. Pending their legal juggle to cure
it of that feature the later will was brought
forward. 1 was announced as an executor
of that will. I knew nothing of my hav
ing been selected to that trust until it was
announced by Mr. Fair himself.
'Well, they cured the earlier will of the
trust clause. An independent action
brought in court resulted in its being de
clared void. Having arranged with all
parties that no appeal should be taken
this will was about to be probated when I
stepped forward, as executor ; of a later
will, to .protest. My counsel urge
the immediate probate of the later will.
Van R. Paterson, who represents minors, j
who have large interests under the first
wall as drawn, with the trust clause in- j
eluded, opposes, yWe accede to his right
to contest and demand an immediate juiy j
trial. This is a right guaranteed, and the ;
way seems clear for a speedy conclusion
and probate of the pencil will.- In the
meantime the discovery is made that the !
peculiar wording of the pencil will seems
to give to each of the three children only
a fourth interest in the estate, whereas
under the earlier will they got a third.
hey determine now" to lay the ghost I
ofthe trust feature by getting an opinion !
from the Supreme Court. They require ,
time for that, and pending that time they
must maintain a position on the fence. j
One wing of them must be ready to drop j
according as the trust is sustained or de- I
stroyed. -.".. : .7, yy y: -, '.
"Charley Fair therefore files an opposi
tion, and the Fair sisters file a demurrer j
to Paterson's opposition. This means i
delay and argumentsâ time. It is reason
ably certain that Paterson will be knocked
out, for he contests the second will only |
by right of the interest his clients j
have under the trust feature of
the â  first. For the time being j
the trust does not exist, for the
lower court has decided against it. If j
Paterson (alls by the wayside Charley Fair
remains to contest and further delay the
probate of the second will in the hope that
a decision of the Supreme Court will con- '
hrm the destruction of the trust, and so
they may all be free to unite against the
later will. If he Supreme Court should
sustain the trust in the earlier willâ which
they fear it will doâ then all would unite
in favor of the later will and you would
find Charley Fair withdrawing his opposi- I
tion to this will and all united 'in its favor.
That is why the change of front, as Mr. j
Knight says, is not as serious as it may j
seem.
CO-ED ATHLETES FETED.
Berkeley Professors Give Din
ners to the Fair Basket-
Bail Players.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 14.â Dinners I
and afternoon teas are oeing given by !
I various members of the faculty to the I
j co-ed basket-ball team, ostensibly for the I
j prime purpose of destroying the prevalent j
i opinion that the faculty do not sanction |
J the playing of the game. It is a well
j known fact, however, that certain of the |
t professors are opposed to this line of !
athletics for the young women, on the ;
grounds of the violent effort required in !
J it and of the tendency it might have to j
destroy their femininity. A few of the
i more fervent adherents of the athletic side !
j of college life for the co-eds have come
I out and are showing their sympathy in i
| the cause by affordine them entertain- |
j ment.
Last evening the team was dined by j
| Professor and Dr. Bitter at their home on -
: Durant avenue in an elegant manner. To- ;
morrow evening it is understood that they
will he entertained by Professor- Elmer E.
, Brown at his residence on Charming way,
| and on Saturday they will be tendered an
| afternoon tea at the home of Professor and
Mrs. Magee.
Still others are to give dinners to the
' young women, but their names have not ;
: been publicly announced. One of the fair- !
! est of the team said to-day that they all ;
i were much Mattered at the kindness shown
\ them by those who had furnished the en- ''
! tertainment, "for," said she, "the boys
j have never been treated in this hospitable
manner, for anything they ever did or tried
I to do in athletics, bo far as we know."

instructions? Answer: Ignored them and de
fied reputable members of the party who have
earnestly urged that no deviation from usual
methods be inaugurated. We find that "our
Caesars have been eating something that has
made then unusually fat and independent."
Whereas this failure of the committee to call a
primary election places the members of the
party within the conditions anticipated by the
State Central Committee when they formu
lated the following: "Provided that in any
Congressional district where there is no Re
publican Congressional committee the Repub
lican State Committee shall appoint from the
residents of such district a committee for the
purpose of calling a district convention to
elect district delegates." and justifies, if no
other reason does, the assumption by the
people of the powers which their creatures re
fuse to exercise, to Wit: the calling of a pri
mary election. Therefore organized bodies of
Republicans sent their representatives to a
meeting held in Oakland April 8, 1896, when
I the following action was taken : .
Resolved, That a primary election be held in
I this county on the 18th day of April, 1890, be
tween the hours of 2 and 8 p. m., for the pur
pose of electing delegates to a county conven
| tion to convene at in Oakland on the
i 20th day of April, 1896, at 11 a. ji., and said
convention shall consist of 128 members, ap
portioned as follows: Oakland, First Ward, 7;
! Oakland, Second Ward, 10; Oakland, Tnird
j Hard, 10; Oakland, Fourth Ward. 9; Oakland,
Fifth Ward, B;Â«Oakland, Sixth Ward, 7: Oak
land, Seventh Ward, 11 ; Alameda, 19; Berke
ley, 12; Brooklyn Township, 5; Oakland Town
ship. 9; Eden Township, 8; Murray Township,
0; Washington Township, 7; total, 128.
Resolved, Tbe business of the county conven
tion thus convened shall be the apportionment
and selection of the forty-seven delegates to
the State convention as aforementioned and
such other matters as may properly come be
fore it. "
Resolved, That all ballots voted at the pri
mary election must be eight inches in length
and four inches wide. The paper shall be of a
pink color, and shall be in the type required
by the election laws now in force, and worded
as follows:
Delegates to the Republican County Conven
tion.
Resolved, That the official ballot-box at each
polling-place must remain in plain, unob
structed view from the opening to the close of

Lame Back
AMEdACK
Of all the distressing ailments man is afflicted with, it
would be hard to find one more common than the one known
generally as "lame back," nor one whose causes are more uncer-
tain. "Lame back" may be caused by a strain in former years,
by weak kidneys, by weak nerves and vital organs, or by one of
a hundred other causes, but whatever the cause it is certainly a
weakness of the nerves which find their foundation or center at
this point, the small of the back.
Dr-SANDEN'S
Electric Belt, which gives its invigorating electric currents direct
to the small of the back, and naturally builds up the weakened
muscles, will cure and has cured hundreds of cases of lame back.
See this letter :
A Wonderful San Jose Cure.

DR. A.T. PANDENâ Dear Sir: You ask me for a statement concerning my back since .
have been using yoUr Electric Belt. 1 was under the Impression I had written you about it but
whether or not, here goes: I suffered from a lame back all of 14 years as bad.as any man could
suffer. I used to have to rollout of bed, and if 1 sat down I could not get up Tor ten minutes!
I would almost cry with pain at times. I t sled everything and got no relief till I eot your Bpit
1 received the Belt on. the 7th day of last month (February). l put It on the evening of the
tame day, wore It all night. I had not a pain in the morning. 1 went to work feellne; well ant-
have had no pain since, and don't expect any if I take care of myself. That is the truth and I
am thankful to you and the Belt for being able to say it. You can do as you plea.c with thii
statement. You know where 1 live. Yours truly, THOS. O'CONNOR
; '. - . * o* South River street, San Jose, Cal.

\Â»*j> liniments, besides the numerous prescriptions
-' the doctors give for lame back, during the
y j fourteen years he sufferedâ and after all Dr.

ON THE REGENTS.
Stormy Session Over the
Site for Affiliated
Colleges,
â _
THE OCTOPUS ASSAILED.
Mayor Indignant Because the
Board of Regents "jumped
on" Him.
A STREAM OF VITUPERATION.
Governor Budd in His Wrath Cal ed
Sutro's Words Scurrilous
Demagogism.
."After my princely gift to the University
you slander rue, you traduce me; you try
to cast odium and dishonor on my name;
you jump on me a<id demand that I sign
a paper in twenty-four hours." This and
much more in the same strain shouted
Mayor Sutro to the Board of Regents yes
terday. Th* session was exciting through
out. The Mayor railed at the octopus and
applied to Huntington and his follow
ers such terms as thief, scoundrel, satel
lite, flunky and nincompoop.
Governor Budd demanded that the lan
guage should be taken down. Sutro
shouted, "Take it down!" while the young
lady stenographer, bewildered by the sen
sational scene, could not keep up with the
current of vituperation.
The meeting was called to receive Mayor
Sutro's final answer to the demand of the
regents that he should extend the time
clause in tbe deed of land for Affiliated
Colleges, and also make definite reply to
the demand that he should sign the agree
ment to transfer the proposed Sutro
library and land to the university.
The regents attending the" meeting
were Governor Budd, Hallidie, Miller,
Denicke, Martin, Howell (oi Fresno), Kel
logg, Phelps, John E. Budd (Stockton),
Foote. Wallace, Crocker, Marye, Bern
stein. Chase, Waymire and Slack. Aside
from members of the board Mayor Sutro,
Attorney Mhoou, O. P. Evans. Architect
Krafts and Secretary Bonte were present.
Every one there seemed to recognize
that the important business on hand was
that relating to Affiliated Colleges site, so
when Colonel C. F. Crocker moved to sus
pend the regular order and take up the
report of the law committee the motion
was instantly carried.
Governor Budd called on Judge Wallace
for a report, and the Judge, with admirable
presence of mind, requested Attorney
Mhoon to present the document.
Major Moo n related briefly the negoti
ations with Mayor Sutro which were be
gun last September, and continued until
last Monday. Reference was made to the
incident that Mayor Sutro lost or mislaid
the first agreement which the law com
mittee had prepared for his signature. In
conclusion the attorney said "Yesterday
Judge Wallace and ! submitted the second
agreement to Mr. Sutro, an.l he said then
that ie would take it under advisement
and answer to-day."
At the request of Governor Budd Major
Mhoon read the agreement. The Governor
then indicated that the regents were ready
to hear from the Mayor.
Mayor Sutro began bis remarks in a mild
and placid style that; gave no hint that be
was loaded with oral dynamite. He said:
'â¢It was a year ago when the question came
up to build the Affiliated Colleges. The idea
occurred to me then that a site of twenty
six acres, which I had in my mind for the
Sutro Library, could be divided, one for
the colle_es and the other for the library.
The Board of Regents accepted my gift for
college land, which had no restriction other
than that work should be commenced
within six month?. I went to work accord
ing to the terms of my gift and opened and
graded the streets. Time went by and the
regents did nothing. Extraordinary delays
took .ace. Yet yesterday I was suddenly
asked to sign another agreement within
twenty-four hours. I thought it nard to
ask a man who had made a princely gift to
the university to sign a paper in "twenty
four hour?. _ am a busy man. I have
official duiies demanding my attention,
and to be jumped on in this manner was
more than I could stand."
Governor Budd â Have you not bad six
months' time to consider the agreement
you were asked to sign ?
Mayor Sutroâ lf time has elapsed I
charge it at your door. Nobody came
near me until yesterday.
Governor Buddâ The attorney said you
had a copy of the agreement "which you
lost or mislaid.
Mayor Sutroâ That has nothing to do
with it.
Governor Budd â It has a great deal to
do with it; but go on.
Mayor Sutro (going on)â I say now that
I will do aii that I agreed to do. The fact
is when this matter was first broached I
was dealing with the Affiliated Colleges
site. The library came in as a modified
proposition. 1 told McKinstry and Wal
lace that I had plans for the library, but
did not want the library taxed. You have
my letters here, but they do not contain
my conversation with "Wallace and Mc-
Kinstry. 1 did not a ree to surrender my
right to appoint the library trustees."
The Mayor, who had been getting a little
excited, began to talk ranidlv. He
said: "I have some enemies here, and I
wiil point them out before 1 get through.
There is a disposition to throw odium upon
me, to condemn me as a dishonored man,
because I would not sign an agreement on
twenty-four hours' notice. The Octopus
has got duukeys and hirelings and news
papers to east odium on me. They have
got lickspittles high and low to oppose me,
in order to assist the funding bill. If that
bill passes the country will go to the dogs.
i iii-y expect to find some fraud in my gift.
Governor Budd (to stenographer )-^Tuke
down everything he says.
Mayor sbuuoâ Yes, take down the Gov
ernor's language, too.
Sutro (resuming)â Fellows that ought to
be in the State prison are opposing me.
The Potrero site was first wanted, and
after the board accepted my site they re
solved to beat it. Hunting'ton, the head
of the flunkeys, is a scoundrel and a self
confessed criminal who ought to be in
prison. Yes. take it down. He has a fol
lowing of nincompoops and scoundrels,
some of them of little caliber. Some of
them are members of honorable commis
sions and scientific bodies, but they keen
lathe background and have fiunkevs do
their work. The fact is they don't want
this location of mine for the colleges. They
want to destroy my rood name and de
stroy my princely gift. The big steal in
Congress is }" be passed this weeK, and
mat will end the republic. The meanest
concerns in the world are the newspapers.
The hirelings form public opinion, as the
common people do not understand many
questions. Now, you want me to sign
something in twenty-Four hours, and yon
seek to malign me because I will not do it
There may be a nigger in this .
Governor Budd If interrupting)â Snrelv
Judge Wallace and Major Mhoon would
not put a nigger in the agreement. 1 have
been in favor of your site from the first
Mayor Sutro (to Governor Budd)â You
are trying to pick flaws with me.
U. P. Evans obtained the floor to ex
plain how the library transaction became
involved with the college site. Mention
was made of conferences wherein Sutro,
Reuben Lloyd, Judge McKinstry and
himself participated. Mr. Evans said,
"So far as I am able to state there never
has been a time when Mr. Sutro was not
willing to sign the original agreement."
Mayor Sutroâ l desired to endow the
library and was shown a clause where i
could'give it to the university and still ap
point the trustees. I have had high respect
for regents in their day, and possibly now;
but in the future I thought we might pet
a Governor under the control of the oc-
topus.
Mr. Sutro then expressed his opinion to
the' effect that Huntington, Collis P.,
is a scoundrel. When he finished with
this statement he said that he would con
sult his attorneys and get a consultation of
the regents' attorneys and his own.
Judge Wallace, who had been examining
the records of the regents, said that on
September 10, 1895, Sir. Sutro had agreed
to convey the library site within ninety
days.
.Mayor Sutroâ l did not find an hour to
give to the work.
The Mayor attempted to speak again,
when the Governor rapped vigorously
for order, saying sharply:
"There is no attempt to jump" on you.
Now you must come to order. Ihe regents
ask you to carry out the contract. You
come here and traduce the ooard. In the
interests of California the regents ask you
to sign your agreement. They ask for no
more, and will take no less."
Judge Wallace reminded the board that
Mr. Sutro never consented to convey the
library management to the regents.
After further discussion, in which many
of the regents participated, and in which
Sutro managed to introduce the octopus
several times. Judge Wallace offered a
resolution that the board accept the col
lege site without reference to the library.
"We have not paid him anything, recol
lect. In the liberality of bis heart he gave
us this college site first. Then he said in
further generous spirit, '1 will give the
library site,' but the tax of the endowment
precludes it. Let us now take the college
site of thirteen acres."
Governor Buddâ lf this motion had
been tnaae in the beginning I would have
voted for it, but now after all his refusals
and his talk I would see that university
sink before I could be whipped into line by
his scurrilous demapogism.
Regent Foote said he would not allow
his personal feelings of indignation and
disgust to restrain him from doing his duty
to the university.
Mayor Sutro "tried to speak again, but
the Governor, showing some excitement,
said: "Mayor Sutro, take your seat; you
have been beard enough."
Regents Waymire and Houghton were
willing to give the Mayor further time.
George T. Marye acquiesced in the ex
tension of time, but he was moved to dep
recate Mr. Sutro's remarks as "infelici
tous."
It was resolved at length, after Sutro
named McKinstry, Lloyd and Moore as
his attorneys, to have Wallace, Foote and
Mhoon meet them. So the question was
In effect referred to the law committee
again, but Judge Slack declined to serve.
Before leaving the room Sutro offered
to then and there sign the extension of
time for the college deed.
J. West Martin wanted the personalities
ofthe day expunged from the minutes, as
the records of the board bad never been
marred by such proceedings.
Judge Wallaceâ lf it was fit to hear, it is
fit to go on record. I did not take any of
his remarKs as a personal affront. [Laugh
ter.]
Shortly after Mayor Sutro retired, Gov
ernor Budd started for San Jose.
Judge Waymire was called to tbe chair
and much routine business transacted.
Bills amounting to 122.*) were passed.
The law committee on the Sutro nego
tiations is under instructions to report
three weeks hence. The board adjourned,
having resolved to expunge nothing from
the minutes, it having been ascertained
that the stenographer did not catch the
personalities, as they flew around so
rapidly.
RICHMOND IS AROUSED.
S
Better Fire-Extinguishing Facili
ties Will Be De
manded.
Views of Residents -.nd Members of
the Department on the Urgency
of the Need.
The fatal result of the fire on Sunday
night on Thirteenth avenue, near Lake
street, has used the people of the Rich
mond district to what they term the in
adequate protection offered to residents in
case of a conflagration, and at a meeting
of consolidated clubs to be held
in Croswaithe Hall to-night that will be
one of the matters discussed. The resi
dents will demand additional fire-aiarm
stations, larger water mains, more hy
drants and a change ofthe site of the truck*
company nearest to the district.
"Here we have a territory," said J. H.
Bond of the Richmond Banner yesterday,
"that extends from Central avenue to the
Cliff House and from the north line of
Golden Gate Park to the southern bound
ary of the Presidio reservation, including
336 blocks, and the measurement of which
is three milts one way by one the other,
wi th only one engine company in the dis
trict, that is No. 26, on Second avenue,
between A and B streets. There are other
companies that answer to alarms from
here, but they are so far away that a great
deal of time is lost in reaching a tire.
"The water mains in this growing dis
trict are not large enough, and if the
Spring Valley 'Water Company, .hat has
been pleading poverty, can "put up a
$300,000 building it certainly ought to
have means at its command to increase
| the size of the mains here. We have but
eight-inch mains and these do not simply
I enough water when more than one engine
! takes water from them at the same time.
"We have asked. for different things, but
! we have not always had them accorded to
jus by the authorities. This matter of
I protection against fire will be discussed at

the meeting Wednesday night and we will
then make a demand for better protection.
There are a great many new houses being
erected in this district at this time. This
morning I counted thirty-two going no in
different directions. Buildings are going
up on the line of the Sutro road and there I
is no protection from fire there. There is
the Cliff House, the baths and adjacent
property and not an engine company
nearer than forty-two blocks.
"If a fire .broke out in the Cliff House
when a southwester was blowing nothing
could save the buildings around there un
less it was a miracle. The roads out here
are not in good condition, and that renders
it difficult to get an engine over the ground
in a hurry at a time when time is of the
greatest importance."
John J. Murphy, the engineer of 26 en
gine, said that bad roads is a serious hin
drance to effective service. "Why," said
he, "our men in the nighttime have to go
ahead with lanterns to examine the roads
and streets to prevent the engine from get
ting stalled. The mains ought to be
larger, for when one engine takes suction
at a hydrant and then another engine
takes suction at another hydrant near by
neither obtains a good stream. True, we
have hydrants in the salt-water main, but
in the use of that we are handicapped in

"We are assisted in this district by
engine 23 on Washington street, near
Baker, No. 30 engine at Stanyan and Wal
ler streets and No. 5 truck on Post street,
near Fillmore, but : it takes these compa
nies a long time to reach here."
T. G. Parker stated that the truck com
pany on Post street, near Fillmore, has to
climb a heavy grade to reach the Rich
mond degree/and he was of the opinion
that it ought to be located near California
street and Central avenue, as from that
point it would be down grade in three
directions and a great deal of time would
be saved in reaching a point. There is
need for more signal boxes and some cer
tainty of being able to get keys when
wanted. The key for box 412 is in a house
the occupant of which is in Marin County
eleven months in the year.
"The people here are going to agitate for
better protection and unless the cry of 'no
money is raised they will get it."
"To cave in" comes from the English
coal-mining regions. After a mine had
been worked out and abandoned, the last
item in its history was the caving in of the
ground above.

NEW YORK, N. V.. April 14.âSpeculation at
th* Stock Exchange Is broadening, the dealings in
stocks to-day having aggregated 213,900 shares. A
more confident tone also characterized the trading.
The recent official statements from Washington
tba* action on the Cuban resolutions is likely to be
â¢ postponed for some time again exerted a stimu
lating effect. The further reduction In the posted
rates of sterling exchange and a belief that there
will be no gold shipments this week added to the
bullish feeling. Putthermore, the Impression that
the more seasonable weather is bound to aflect
trade favorably. Id to buying by the more ven
turesome of the bull and the purchases assisted the
upward movement during the early session. as
of late, the Industrials were most conspicuous in
the transactions. Sugar rose Â«o 123, the best price
attained since the current upward movement set
in. The stock was taken by lower Wall street In
terest on the favorable ouiloo.. tor the trade. In
the late dealings the stock ran off to 122(0,1221,4.
Tobacco, after declining to 848/4 rose to 86Va and
later broke and closed at 81. The break was due
to the revival of the rumor that the scrip dividend
will be enjoined. Chicago Gas rose to 703/g. It was
stated that the company intended resuming the
payment of dividends, but nothing authentic could
be obiained and the report was not generally cred
ited. General Electric was weaker 1 ban the other
industrials and fell to 37*4. In the railway list the
Vanderbllts, Goulds, Grangers ami Reading stocks
were In better demand. Michigan Central at one
time showed a tain of nearly 2% at 97, while Man
hattan brought 1121% In the late trading when
Tobacco weakened on the Injunction rumor, the
entire list ran off on reaiizings and the market
closed rather weak in tone. Net changes show
gains of !_'-.!% In the general list and losses of
about as much In Tobacco, General Electric and
Northern Pacific preferred.
Bonds were active and strong.. The sales footed

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 14.â Wheat behaved Ir
regularly to-day, the changes from strength to
weakness and vice versa being numerous and sud- j
den. Beginning at an advance of V_@%c over j
yesterday's close on ihe strength of Liverpool ;
j cables, it was not long until prices were as much be- ;
i low that point. The offerings which were Instru- j
I mental In effecting the depreciation were scat
tered, but for the most part represented local
I opcrat ons. Within the first hour a complete '
i alteration In the tone and feeling took place and a :
I full recovery was noted. Northwestern receipts
were 458 cars, against 510 last Tuesday and 170 a
year ago. Chicago received 17 cars and Inspected
out 154,500 bushels.
Export clearances were light at 46,268 bushels.
Closing Paris cables were unchanged, Antwerp
partly lower and partly higher and Berlin lower.
The announcement by Bradstreet's of a decrease
in the world's available supply of 3,282.000 â¢
bushels imparted further firmness to he market, ;
additional advances taking place, but the selling :
became heavy and the inside figures of the session |
were established on the break which followed. i
May wheal opened from 65% cto 65% t- - sold be- j
tween 66c any 6434(g.645.' c, closing at 64 (&66c, j
y 2 <3.5/sc under yesterday. Estimated receipts for ,
to-morrow 10 cars.
CORNâ Was quite active early in the session, I
the period of noteworthy animation beini; short, |
however. Better prices ruled at that lime, fol-
I lowed by recessions, which in turn were succeeded i
by rallies. The impulse or motive came from !
wheat. Receipts were 209 cars and 67,630 busheis '
were withdrawn from store. Liverpool cables
were quiet and y^d lower. Export clearances were I
32,189 bushels. Bradstreet's reported a decrease I
in available stocks of 83,000 bushels. The close .
was about steady. May corn opened at 3014c, 501d i
at 3-c, closing at 30yijc, unchanged from yester- |
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 94 cars.
OATSâ Did not depart from the usual custom or i
habit of emulating the movements of the more !
Important markets. The average tone was steady, !
and prices did not alter much. Receipts were 235 i
cars. There were no withdrawals from store. An
increase in stocks of 318,000 bushels was given by i
Bradstreet's. Exports of oats were 54,743 bushels. i
May oats closed i 8 c under yesterday. Estimated \
receipts lor to-morrow. 110 cars.
FLaXâ Was firm. Cash, 92c; May, 89(ii89Vic; ,
September, 92 1 , 2<5Â»93i/2C. Receipts were 20 cars. j
VISION â 1 here was a shade less in hog !
prices at the yards this morning, and. of course, !
product duly reflected it by declining to corre- j
spond. Moderate trading took place and short :
terms of real activity were noted, but the session, j
taken as a whole, was nothing more than ordi- '
nary. At the close he feeling was easy, in sym
pathy with wheat. May pork closed unchanged.
.May* lard B(a,7y_c lower, and May ribs 12y a c
lower.

THE STOCK MAEKET.
The market was off yesterday. . especially at the
close, Ophir declining to 85 cents. Occidental to 90
cents ami the other slocks In proportion. There
was some selling at the decline.
In the Chollar mine jln the south . stope one 450
level they are preparing to raise on the streak of
ore reported last week and are assorting the ore
fillings, which are of fair grade. On the sixth and
seventh floors of the stope above No. 2 crosscut on
this level they are opening out in new ground east
of the old stope on streaks of ore and are assorting
the old liU. They are also preparing to raise from
the seventh floor on some small streaks of pay.
They have shipped to the Nevada mill for reduc
tion during th*' past week 56 tons of ore, the aver
age battery sample of v h'ch. with that previously
extracted, was $22 46 per ton.
. In th*' Potod mine repairs continue to be made
on the 450 and 650 levels. On the. tunnel level at
a point 331 feet In from the switch in the south
east drift they are runnlngasoutheast drift through
the old stope to prospect the ground above and
west of it.
The official report from the Hale <fc Norcross
mine for the week ending April 10 says: Oper
ations were resumed In the mine on Wednesday,
the Bth ins!., with four men, who completed the re
pairs in he shaft in a few hours. This force was
increased to ten men on Thursday, and they hive
been repairing the shaft station and 975" level,
which work will not be entirely finished ior several
days. The work. of extracting ore. from the 975
level will begin one day later than expected,
that is to-morrow. April 12, and also prospecting
on the 1100 level on the same date.
The following oilicial dispatch was received yes
terday from Virginia City : The Dazet mill at Sil
ver City, under control of the company, com
menced crushing Hale *fc norcross ore this morn
ing. The ore is hauled by teams from the mine to
the mill for 80 cents per ton. . Â,.,â¢â¢,
The Bank of California has declared a quarterly
dividend of S3 per share, payable to-day.
The Hutchinson Plantation Company has de
clared a monthly dividend of 15 cents per share,
payable April 20.
The ' on. California and Virginia Mining Com
pany has an ectual cash balance on hand, with all
bills for the previous month paid, of about $30,000,
with the assessment of 30 cents per share on about
12.000 shares, advertised as delinquent, to be col
lected, and an accumulation of good ore soon to be
crushed.
a late report from the Savanah mine of Grub
Gulch says; The work at the mine Is progressing
very well. Shaft 1 Is coming into quartz of a
very good quality and the prospects are that we
will soon be In a large body of good ore, but sink
ing the shaft is slow work and lt will be some days
before we can tell about the extent of this body of
ore. In the south level, shaft 1, we have struck
ore of a high grade and it is Improving as we go In.
The ore prospects well in free gold and carries a
large percentage of sulphurets- We have now run
about fifteen feet in this and it shows up well In
the face of the drift. We are running a tunnel on
the ledge at the base of the hill at the Wide
Awake. The outlook is extremely encouraging.
We are going on the ledge with stringers of quartz
coming in. The appearances indicate that we will
not hay â¢ to run very far before coming to the
quartz. This tunnel if nrosecuted will soon afford
a plentiful subply of ore to keep the mill running
continuously and make the mine a regular divl
d end-paying mine. From present appearances the
mine should be placed on a dividend-paying basis
inside of ninety days at an expenditure of from
$5000 to $6000.
Assessments Pending.

A newspaper woman, who sends society
letters from Washington to one of the
Philadelphia papers, is going about telling
this story on a certain Senator, whose
princely entertainments are famous the
country over. She went to his house one
night on the occasion of a big reception.
The first person she saw was the host him
self. He asked her errand courteously.
"I came to get the ladies' gowns," said ,
she.
The Senator glanced into the great ;
drawing-room at the dazzle and gleam of j
bare shoulders.
"Don't you think they need all they
have?" said he.â Washington Post.

PUBLIC UTILITIES

Throes of Such a Con
tention.
FRUITFUL EXPERIMENTS
*
City Fathers Make Revela
tions in the Matter of
Economy.
MUNICIPAL LEAGUE FORMED.
A Convincing Report of the Expense
of One Hun-red Months of
Ownersh p.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 12.â Alameda
fs at present in the midst of a struggle
Vrith the problem of city ownership of
public utilities. They have a big fight on
their hand?, and they and their sup
porters look on the Oakland Gas, Light
and Heat Company as their bugbear.
Ten years ago the Jenney Electric Light
ing Company entered into business here,
received a franchise and supplied the light
for fifty-two arc lamps to the city at a
cost of $">_H per month. The city eventu
ally bought out the company and its piant
for $40,000, which is claimed was at least
twice its actual value, and in February of
this year were running 100 arc lights,
2000-candle power, at a cost of slightly
over $6 per month, and 1335 incandescent
lights to private consumers, for which
they received over $350 per month.
The electrician in charge, G. A. Wiese,
has no Jess than 1500 applications for 3000
new incandescent lights, and the Trustees
are anxious to erect more arc lights. To
do this more power and electricity is re
quired.
After considering the difficulty, the City
Trustees decided on enlarging the city's
electric lighting plant, and at the tame
time cteaiing with another large expense
that confronted them monthly, vi;.: the
payment on the average of $1000 per month
for eight, months of the year for street
sprinkling. They determined <->n sinking
a well on their sections at the south end of
Park street, where the electric works are
installed, using salt water instead of fresh
for sprinkling the streets, and utilizing
the engines that generate the electricity at
night to pump the water in the day time.
Accordingly bids were advertised for,
and on February 3 it was decided to pro
cure new engines and boilers at a cost of
$15,502, and sink a well for which the City
Treasurer was to pay the sum of $19f.
Later on in the month a new 250 kilo
watt incandescent dynamo was purchased
for the sum of $74*63. This dynamo is
guaranteed to be able to furnish electricity
for 12,000 incandescent lights of 16-candfe
power. The old dynamo, which originally !
cost $1600, was taken as part payment for
$1500, and other old stocks and fittings
sold, reducing the total indebtedness in
curred from $26,4 to $21,732.
Mr. Britten. secretary of the Oakland
Gas. Light and Heat Company, contended
publicly that his company could supply
light much cheaper than "the city could.
This started the agitation and though Mr,
Brittan failed to materialize at the meet
ing of the City Trustees to discuss his
claims as arranged the agitation still kept
un, fanned in some measure by the atti
tude ofthe local press toward the project.
The opponents of the scheme then j
sought the aid of the courts and at the in- i
stigation of John Fleming, an attorney in :
Ban Francisco, but a resident of Alameda, j
an injunction was served upon the City
Trustees to restrain them from improving
the city electric light plant. The injunc- |
tion was dismissed three weeks after on
the motion of the City Attorney, E. K. j
Taylor. The Trustees immediately held a
meeting and approved of bills" to the
amount of $3300 -part payment for housing |
and erecting plant but the City Treasurer !
has not paid the same, inasmuch as a j
pecond injunction was at once served upon
the board and again proceedings were at i
a standstill.
A new factor has also appeared in the '
statement that cities of the fifth class, j
BUCh as Alameda, have no right under their
charters to sell or dispose of lights to their
citizens, and one gentleman, F. Delanoy,
bookkeeper for the Sterling Electric Sup
ply Company. San Francisco, applied to
the city for a Franchise to test the point.
To further the interests of Alameda city j
and other cities similarly situated a mv- '<
nicipal league was formed, a preliminary'
meeting urranced for and the Municipal
League of Alameda, No. 1, was instituted.
The statement of principles, to which no
less than 350 signatures have been already
obtained, and which constitute the mem
bership in the league, is as follows:
I believe in the maintenance of municipal
ownership and operation of an electric light
plant by the city of Alameda.
I indorse the proposition to enlarge said
plant from time to time, as public necessity
may demand, so as to provide for the lighting
of our streets and public buildings in such a
manner ns may be a pride to our citizens, who
wish the same, with electric lighting at a mini
mum cost.
1 indorse the policy of city ownership of
water supply and means of distribution, and
favor the acquisition thereof by the city of Al
ameda as soon as practicable.
Some of the most respectable, wealthy
and conservative citizens of the town have
become members thereof.
There are now nearly 400 names on the
membership roll and the number is steadily
increasing. , The management is in the
hands of an executive committee of seven,
whose names are a guarantee that the or
ganization is controlled by representative
business men. They are the following:
Frank H. McCormick, Pacific Coast agent
of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific
Railway,; president; Dr. E. B. Clark,
oculist and â¢ aurist, vice-president; Her
man Krusi, vice-president and manager of
the San Francisco Bridge Company ; Green
Majors, attorney-at-law; George E. Plum*
mer, a wealth}- ship grocer; Colonel J. .1.
Tobin. deputy Internal Revenue Collector,
and Captain E. A. yon Schmidt, practical
dredging man. The secretary is B. C.
Brown, official stenographer to the Master
in Chancery of the United States Circuit
Court.
The league contends that municipal
ownership of light and water is right,
just and proper, is cheaper and more
economical to the taxpayer, is at all times
a valuable asset, and* properly managed,
is much to be preferred to having these
public necessities of life ladeied out by
private corporations when, where and how
they choose, and at the expense of the tax-
aver.
to still further this idea a public meet
ing was held in the council chamber of the
City Trustees Saturday night. Carl Cop
ping Piehn, professor of political economy
of the University of California who has
made a special study of the Question of
municipal ownership, made the principal
speech of the evening. The meeting was
presided over by Frank H. McCormick
president of the league. Charles E.
>;;vi.ir, the expert employed by the
league, also read His report. it was
shown by figures that instead of the city
parting with all its lighting property in
1895 for the film of $325 as contended by
one of the local papers it really had a
Design for au Alameda Library Building Submitted by Architect George A. Dodge,
[From the architect's drawing.]
plant that at a fair valuation was worth
$50,170.
The following report of Charles E. Nay
lor, - expert for the Alameda Municipal
League, was presented:
Having been employed by your executive
committee for the purpose ascertaining the
amount of money expended in the purchase,
construction and maintenance, including re
pairs and running expenses of the city's elec
tric light plant and the value of the services
furnished and the net resultant cost, calculat
ed upon a basis of equitable comparison, with
instructions to make a report at this time to
this meeting, I now beg to present the results
of mv labors and Investigations. All such cal
culations must have a basis, and 1 have as
sumed as my basis that at the time the con
tract was made to purchase from the Jenney
Electric Light Company the original plant as
established by them in ls*~t> the city paid
$40,000 spot cash for the same, this being
the initial investment. As a matter of
fact a part of this sum was paid in cash and
part by the sale of bonds, but this fact
cuts no'tigure in the business calculation. The
investment was $40,000.
I disregard entirely the sunt paid to the said
Jenney company previous to December 1. 1887,
for electric light service under contract at the
rate of $15 per month per lamp, because these
items were entirely disconnected from the pur
chase by the city of the saia plant.
Taking, then, this $40,000 purchase price as
my starting point 1 have added the items of
construction expenditure from time to time,
carrying the account down to April 1. 1596. 1
have also followed the cost of maintenance,
covering repairs, salaries and all other items
of running expenses from December 1, 1837 to
April 1, 1896. just 100 months.
It has been almost impossible to segregate
all Items of construction from running ex
penses, because of the manner of recording the
expenditures. For instance, entries were fre
quently made at times covering quite large
amounts under the general designation of
"supplies" for electric- light works. This
might be for one or the other or both of these
accounts. I have done the best I could in the
limited time and with the facilities at com
mand to separate these items, and believe that
the figures which I give you approximate very
closely to the correct apportionment of the
outlay. But you will quickly understand why
the absolute accuracy of this division or ap
| portionment of expenditure is not of great im
portance as a factor in producing the final
result.
The variation, if any there be, will be found ;
j in placing too much to construction account
I ana somewhat less to the repairs expense ac
| count, but the difference will not be material.
! In producing the final result which I give you
! I woiked by years, taking the original cost of '
1 the plant, $10,000, and adding one year's in
terest, then adding one year's construction
cost, then adding one year's repairs and run
ning expenses. This you will see gives me at I
the end of the first year the total expenditure ;
to that date, '1 hen I subtract from this total a |
credit for the service of the year. This you j
will recognize leaves a net investment with j
which to begin a new year's calculation.
In estimating the value of the services we '
are to credit the plant, I allow per lamp for
the first three years at the rate previously paid ;
to the Jenney company under a three "years' I
j contract, which contract was voided by the â¢
| purchase of the plant, thereafter I used the j
j rate paid by the city cf Oakland for similar |
! service, as nearly as can be ascertained. Ido :
j this rather than take the figures of any other |
city, because it appears self-evident that had ;
| our plant not been purchased we would have |
i been buying our light from trie Oakland com- I
, pany, and in that case we would have to pay at â 
j least the same rate that the city of Oakland has |
paid. Comparisons might be made with other
I cities, but it" the rate in such places be either !
higher or lower than Oakland, the comparison j
j would not be a reasonable one, nor the figures
I as likely to be a correct basis, because of the I
I varying conditions throughout the State, sua '.
. Ing higner or lower rates to prevail, and be
cause of the recognized probability of Oakland
! rate prevailing here in the event of our fail
j ure to purchase the plant when we did.
This i. my reason for using the Oakland ;
; rates, being the only ones that I feel justified j
lin adopting lor the reason named. If this is I
wrong then my calculation would be varied i
accordingly.
ln addition to the credit given the plant for j
arc-light service I have also added a credit for
the income from Hie sale of incandescent lights :
during the past year. Again, there has been a
; combination of city departments which caused '
j some confusion in my investigations. This
I combination is probably nature!, from an elec
| trician's standpoint, because the departments :
I are both electrical, but where each department
must furnish an entirely independent and dis- I
tinct service, standing or falling upon its own j
record, it is just as well to keep those records '
separate. These remarks refer to the fire
alarm system, the expense of maintaining ;
which has been charged up as a part of the j
: maintenance of electric light works.
Upon investigation I ascertain that an equit- l
able sum to charge to the fire alarm system j
would be, according to the estimate of well- '
informed persons, the sum of $125 per month,
and that if it were run as a distinct depart- I
ment (if we had no electric light works and no
electrician to divide his time between the two
departments) the cost wou'd be not less than
$150 a month.
Fearing, however, to rob the Electric-light
Department of too much of its expense ac
count, I have charged the lire alarm system
from the date of its establishment with only
$1000 per annum instead ot $1500 or Â«1800
which these estimates would justify. I sub
tract this sum from the total expense disburse
ments charged in the books to the Electric
light Works. This gives a very cheap fire
alarm system at some expense to the Electric
light Department. However, the entire report
is submitted for your approval, and on points
of this character is subject to change at your
pleasure.
interestâ ln getting the views of taxpayers
on the subject of charging the electric-light in
vestment with interest, I found a diversity of
opinion prevailing, some preferring not to
charge interest to a municipal investment of
any kind, while others considered it perfectly
proper to do so.
In the first statement that I will give you I
have treated the plant as though it was pri
vate property, having added 5 per cent each
year as explained above and as exemplified
below, and will now give you the figures on
this basis.
Kindly remember that in collating the facts
which I present 1 have been particularly care
ful not to be governed in any manner by the
opinions or unsupported statements of" any I
city official although it has been necessary to !
avail myself of the assistance of the City Elec- I
trician and the City Clerk in locating certain !
books and documents and in formulating the
inventory, and I am pleased to state that
neither of these officials has endeavored in any
way to influence me in my work, nor have
I they been given at any time a shadow of a
suggestion as to what my report might be. 1
commend them for their discretion and thank
them for their courtesy in the matter.
For the past fifteen months, as explained, I
have given the plant credit for the income ofthe
incandescent lights amounting to 557 71
Now I present a summary of the above state
ment, which reads as follows:
Purchase and construction.... $77,997 29

7 percent cost $49,112 61
And now I will give you a statement based
upon the actual amount of money paid out for
interest to date added to the other items of
purchase, construction and maintenance.
This you will observe varies from the previous
statement only in the matter of interest, as in
that one we charged interest upon the total in- i
vestment from year to year, while in this
one, as already stated, I only include the in
terest actually paid to the Jenney Electric Com- I
pany and upon the bonds:
Purchase and construction $77,997 29
Maintenance 76,876 68
Interest on bonds actually paid 8,139 24 j
Total $163,013 21
: Less amount paid by S. P. R 1,000 00
Balance $162,013 21 !
i Credit by lights 120,953 71
! Net cost of plant $41,059 50
After making the above statement, I further
j investigated the rates prevailing in Oakland
i for arc lights, and while the same are calcu-
I lated upon a different basis from ours, that is
to say, to much per light per night for an all
night run upon a moonlight schedule, our cal
culations have been made upon a basis of so
much per light per month upon a 1:30 o'clock
a. M. shedule.
I am inclined to think that possibly I have
given the plant credit for a few thousand dol
lars too much because of the intricacy of the
' comparison and the short time in which I have
i done the work, and have made a new state
ment to-day, which I will now give you, based
: upon rates for the past fifty-one months of
â  Sl 50 per month per light, less than the
I figures used in the above statement. This
statement Is as follows: â â¢'-;. ,
Cost of plant, with Interest added
j yearly at 6 percent $56,518 14
Inventory 50,170 75
LO3S $6,347 39
Inventory $50,170 75
Cost of plant, with Interest oniv
actually paid 48.093 35
Net profit.^.? $2,077 40
ANOTHER SUMMARY.
To place the matter in another point of view
the following summary is given, differing from
the former in that interest is charged not on
the whole investment, but only as actually
paid by the city.
Purchase and construction account,
100 months, to April 1, 1896 $ 77.997 29
Less amount paid out by Southern Pa
cific Company account station lights. 1,000 00
$ 70,997 29
Cost of maintenance as above 70,876 68
Interest actually paid (to Jenny __ Co.
upon bonds to date) 8,139 24
Actual outlay of money $162,013 21
Cess present value of plant as per In
ventory 60,170 75
$111,842 46
Less receipts from incandescent plant. 3,557 71
Net coÂ«t of street lighting for 100
months $108,284 75
This last table shows an average of
$1,082 85 per month, for an average of over
eighty-eight lamps per month, as compared
with $810 a month for fifty-four lamps, the
amount being paid for street lighting at and
previous to the date of original purchase in
i 18S9. This shows an average cost of $12 30
1 per lamp per month for the 100 months which
i covers depreciation in plant by wear and tear
. and exchanges of old machinery for new, as
! well as all running expenses.
Inventoryâ For the purpose of ascertaining
I how near the net cost according to the above
figures is to the present value of the plant I
! had a careful inventory made of the city's en
; tire electric light property. The items" I am
satisfied are correct and the prices Riven ap
proximately so, in some cases, according to a
: prominent San Francisco electrician with
i whom I have consulted, being less than the ar-
I tides can be replaced for, while in other cases
: they cover the full value, but upon the whole
, I believe it to be a safe, conservative and proper
' valuation.
I have this inventory here in detail, but will
j not detain you now to read it. Suffice it to
i say that the total amounts to $50,170 75,
I while I have just learned, af tor getting this re
! port ready, that there has been omitted from the
inventory the eighteen-mile wire circuit for the
| railroad station lights. ; . This inventory covers
j only the property owned and paid for, and
does not include any of the unpaid purchases
under the latest contracts for the extension of
I the plant. The incandescent annex installed
during the past year n as produced some reve
nue, which was included in the credit to ser
vice in the above statements.
There are now eighty regular customers for
incandescent lights on the book, and together
with those in the city offices there are 1350 in
candescent lamps on the line, although the ca
pacity of the present machinery will permit
the burning of only 800 lamps at any one
time. . t '
The monthly income at present from the in
candescent system is over $300, the amount
for March being $316 75. This Includes a very
low rate for the lights used in the city public
offices, and I see no objection to giving the
plant credit for the same, as it is saving gas
Dills which would otherwise have to be paid.-
In the inventory all items of expense supplies
now on hand, such as coal, oil, waste, etc.,
which have already been paid for and charged
to expense account have been omitted; also in
the early history of the arc system a few lights
were sold from time to time, but as the income
therefrom was inconsiderable and not easily ar
rived at I allowed that item of credit to pass
unnoticed. These credits, such as abatement
on fire alarm expense, arc light sales and in
ventory of coai, etc., as well as the saving in
individual gas bills by reason of reduced rates,
! will offset any variation in the apportionment
of expenditures and credits for light service.
Now, one more word regarding the incan
| descent department. I have not been able to
i accurately determine the additional cost of
running since this department was added, be
cause, by the introduction of the latest ma
chinery at that time the consumption of coal
proportioned to the work accomplished was
greatly reduced. However, I estimate the ad
ditional expense as salaries and incidentals
approximately at $150 per month. The in
come is about $300 per month, so that there
has not been any actual loss, although if con
ducted as an independent' plant the incan
descent annex would not be self-sustaining
with the small patronage and at the rates now
being charged.
I find that the stores pay a flat rate of 60
cents per lamp per month, and that the proprie
tors of these stores estimate that this is about 50
per cent of what they formerly paid for gas, a
very material saving. The private residences
all have meters and the charge does not de
pend upon the number of lamps in the house,
nut upon the quantity of electricity consumed.
On ail bills exceeding $2 50 there is a discount
allowed of 10 per cent. This discount in
creases as the bill grows, be ng 20 per cent on
bills over $5, 30 per cent on bills over $10 and
40 per Cent on bills over $20, so that in some
instances the more electricity the consumer
uses the less he pays. The rate appears me
to be very low and should; induce the general
use of incandescent lights among our citzens.
The fact that It is not the number of lamps
but the quantity used that is the basis of
charge is much more attractive to the con
sumer than a hat-rate system.
From data on file it is evident that many
more lights will be sold if facilities are in
creased. It would appear that the original
purchase was of a rather inferior piant at
an increased valuation and very expensive to
conduct. The cost of repairs was large.
Also that the outfit was run at a disadvantage
until last year, when most of the old inferior
machinery was taken out and exchanged for
new.
We have now two arc-light dynamos capaDle
of carrying 100 lights each. One of these is
working ud to its limit, while the other is
held in reserve. We also have one incan
descent dynamo, and with the proposed new
outfit there will be capacity for fully 5000
incandescent lights. In addition to ,the 200
arc lights provided for, there should be no ne
cessity for new machinery for at least five
years to come.
If 5000 arc lights can he sold the income
should be from 1500 to $1800 Der month,
j which amount ought to carry the entire cost 01
j running the plant.
It would appear, also, that while no surplus
j help is now employed, some of that help is
; not overworked and could easily perform the
additional semes that will be required by the
j proposed extension and enlarged machinery.

Surprise Partyâ Cylers Hold

ALAMEDA. Cal., April 14.â Last night
among the bills ordered to be paid by the
City Trustees were two of $400 and $450, re
spectively, to Contractor Constable for
buildings at the electric-light works. On
presentation of the warrants this morn
ing Treasurer Wheeler refused to pay
them unless he were indemnified by a
bond of $1000. He does this, he claims, at
the instigation of his bondsmen, who are
not sure whether the injunction suit of
John Fleming against the City Trustees
may not be decided against the city.
A Big Republican Sleeting.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 14.â A meeting
of the Alameda Republican Club has been
called for to-morrow (Wednesday) evening
at Linderman Opera-house, Central ave
nue and Park street. The advisability of
holding joint club primaries for the elec
tion of delegates to the State convention
at Sacramento will be discussed. The
member of the Congressional Committee
from this district, E. K. Taylor, has de
clared his willingness to abide by the de
cision of the club.
Alameda has three Republican clubs â
the Alameda Republican Club, with a
membership of over 700; the Regular Re
publican Club, with an enrollment of 400,
and the Veterans' Republican Club, with
a membership of 75. The two last named
have declared for joint club primaries, and
the action of the Alameda Republican
Club, the oldest and by far the largest or
ganization, is awaited with interest, Abie
speakers will address the meeting, which
bids fair to be the largest political gather-
I ing held in Alameda for some time. It is
I generally conceded that a declaration will
| be made in favor of joint club primaries.
The proposition as advanced la that the
j three ciubs nominate separate tickets to
be voted at a joint club primary to be held
Saturday, the delegates chosen to be in
j dorsed by Committeeman Taylor. This
i action, it is believed, will be generally sat
j isfactory to the Republicans of Alameda,
i and the possibility of a contesting delega
! tion be avoided.
A I'astor's Anniversary*
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 14.â The Rev.
F. O. Brush, pastor or the Presbyterian
Church, and his wife were the recipients
of a pleasant surprise party last night in
ttie church parlors. To render it more
| complete, and to commemorate the tenth
anniversary of their wedding, the Ladies'
Aid Society, through D. D. Stark, pre
sented the couple with two exquisite floral
pieces and a set of solid silverware to Mrs.
Brush. George C. Bordwell also presented
the pastor with a '96 model bicycle on be
! half of the male members of the church.
j The Rev. E. Y. Garette. the former minis
ter of the church, and the Rev. J. Cum;
-; ming Smith from Trinity Church, San
Francisco, were also present and delivered
appropriate speeches.

j conist, and who is it present on his honey
' moon in San Jose.
The dog is now in charge of Constable

! lodged in the City Jail on a charge of steal
j ing him. Schreiber was arrested this
j morning, and his bonds were fixed in the
i sum of $1000 cash.

THE MOBMON CHOIR.
â r-y- y>.yy
The First Concert in Oakland Was a
Musical Triumph.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 14.â The Mor
mon choir gave its first concert in Califor
! nia at the First Congregational Church
! to-night. Apart from the musical perfec-
I tion that has been attained by the choir,
the simple fact that it is a Mormon choir
from the Salt Lake Tabernacle adds greatly
to the interest of the audience. Particu
: larly was this the case when the last num
ber on the programme had been rendered.
The director announced that there was
one more number that they were pleased
to sing. "We have not been a State long,"
he said, 'and we like our State song."
The full choir then sang "Utah, We Love
I Thee." The music is somewhat martial,
and the evident pride of the singers in the
new State was very marked.
The choir presented one of the prettiest
pictures ever seen in Oakland as they
faced the audience. It consisted of about
seventy-five young ladies and sixty men
and was accompanied by a string quartet,
a piano, the church organ and harmonium.
The ladies were all "dressed in white and
each carried a lan:e lily. , They also wore
flowers in the corsage and in their hair.
The chorus singing is perfect and the
soloists possess marked ability.
The program me was arranged so as to
give full scope to the tastes of musical
critics. It contained Scotch airs, selec
tions from "II Travotore," "The Mormon
-Dedication Hymn," "Hosannah" and the
Hallelujah chorus from "The Messiah."
Master Charlie Pike, the boy alto, is cer
tainly a phenomenon. His voice is mar
velously rich and powerful and it seemed
almost impossible that the excellent ren
dition of "Angels Ever Bright and Fair"
could come from such a boyish throat.
The choir is staving in its own special
I train at the mole and hundreds of friends
have come with the singers. During their
] trip they will give only eight concerts in
this State.
Root Is Held.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 14. â Root, the
gold-brick swindler, was remanded to cus
tody this afternoon, when he made his
fifth attempt for liberty by the habeas cor
pus route. Chief Lloyd is making despe
rate efforts to hold his man, and as a last
recourse he will turn the man over to

VABNI'S DEATH.
Beginning of the Trial of one of the
Two Accused.
OAKLAND, Cat.., April 14.â The trial of
Michael Ghirardelli, charged with the
murder of Felice Varni on December 1,
1895, in the foothills back of Elmhurst,
was begun before Judge Greene to-day.
The case will be stubbornly contested, and
as there is nothing but circumstantial evi
dence there is some doubt as to whether a
conviction will be secured.
Varni went out hunting with Ghirar
delli, Lazeretta and Devincenzi, and the
next day his dead body was accidentally
found by a deputy sheriff who was out
serving papers. The evidence at the pre
liminary examination was not strong.
Landmark Going;.

this sign hanging outsida

new era of drug selling.
Is it any wonder that ha
has to enlarge his quar-

busy, and that his store is
one of the most popular
along the leading thor-
oughfare ?
You can afford to trada
with a druggist that haa
such a motto as that.

Golden Gate Hall yesterday afternoon.
The attendance numbered over a hun
dred. Mrs. A. A. Sargent presided.
Miss Susan B. Anthony made a short
address after the reports had been re
ceived from several of the county associa
tions offering suggestions as to the most
effective wav in which to conduct the cam
paign ior the striking out of the word
"male" in the eleventh amendment of
the State constitution.
The reports all indicated thatthe county
associations are waring a vigorous and
encouraging campaign.
The Women's Educational and Indus
trial Union gave a reception to Susan B.
Anthony last night at 7 Van Ness avenue.

Miss Anthony was greeted with a wav

Of honest iabor for women, maintaining it
was best for them to be able to eat the

come over men's minds with regard to the
women question, and in the near future
men would give to women all the rights
and privileges they now alone possess.

PUNS FOR THE
NEW POSTOFFICE
Changes Suggested by Post
master McCoppin a
Month Ago.
SUBMITTED TO AIKEN.
The Architect Is Responsible for
the Delay in Beginning
Work.
WILL NOW FORCE THE ISSUE.
Pressure Will B2 Brcujht to Bear on
the Department by the California
Delegation.
Postmaster McCoppin yesterday gave
out the correspondence between himself
and Supervising Architect Aiken at Wash
ington in regard to the changes in the
plans for the new Postoffice building in
this City. The letters of the Postmaster
go to show that he did everything in his
power to hasten matters rather than to
check the progress of the enterprise.
It was given out by the Architect's oilice
at Washington that the delay in the com
mencement of work on the building was
because of the delay which the Kan Fran
cisco Postmaster and the Federal Judges
had caused in not changing and returning
the Architect's plans as requested. This
letter of Mr. McCoppin to Mr. Aiken
clearly defines the position of the Post
master:
San Francisco. March IG, IS9C.
Hon. William H. Aiken, Supervising Architect,
Treasury Department, Washington, 1). V. -Dear
bin: Through the courtesy of lion. John P. Irish,
recently returned from Washington, I have
been permitted to inspect the "alternative
sketch plans for United states Courthouse,
Postoffice, etc.. San Francisco, Cal.." as pre
pared under your supervision, and at his sug
gestion I venture to offer a few ideas concern
ing the same. In doing so I am, of course,
proceeding upon the supposition that you will
be guided to some extent, in preparing plans,
by the representations of those who know from
practical experience what is required.
The modern postoffice requires special facili
ties for its accommodation and Its equipment,
for the best service is as particular in its way
as that required in any lactory or industrial
establishment. Its arrangement should be
such as to lacilitate every movement, provide
security and subserve the convenience and
comfort of both the public and the postal force
employed.
In my judgment the plan submitted fails to
meet these requirements in several particu
lars, and 1 take the liberty pointing: out to
you in detail such alterations as 1 think
should be made. [Here the Postmaster sug
gests that all closets, etc., be placed in the
basement of the building instead of upon the
main floor as provided in the plans.] A second
defect in the plan submitted is thatthe pro
posed stamp department is removed from and
out of touch with the cashier's department.
It is most essential tnat these two divisions of
theoffici should be in easy, communication
I nder the plan submitted all cash taken in for
stamps would have to be carried through the
public lobby for deliver; to the cashier. This
would not only be inconvenient but danger
ous.
1 think further that provision should be
made for the three -tamp windows opening
upon the public lobby, one for wholesale
transactions and two for retail purposes. The
retail divisions do not require much space, an
allotment of too square leet being sufficient
but the wholesale division should have room
enough to accommodate securely the im
mense stock of valuable supplies carried by an
office of this size. Tne space allotted upon the
plan before me. viz., 18x36," is not sufficient
ior this office unless provision be made for
storerooms beneath, communicating by ele
vator with the salerooms above. 1 would sue- !
gest, therefore, that the wholesale stamp
division be made to communicate directly
with the cashier's office: that such division be
given at least 1000 square feet of floor space
and thai two retail stamp apartments lead
irom the wholesale department. In this con
nection again I notice that no provision is
made for a vault in the cashier's division
Tnis is an absolute necessity; and I presume
its omission is due to an oversight.
The room set aside for the assistant Post
master, viz.. 18x30, is larger than it neea be
An apartment 22x20 is sufficient. I would
suggest that space be saved here and given to
the anteroom leading to the Postmaster's quar
ters. The anteroom is an important feature of
the ban Francisco Postoffice. Here the public
is received and the inquiry clerk and messen
ger nave desks. It is constantly thronged
with people and should be roomy" well-venti
lated and comfortable.
Another and a very serious objection which
J find to the plan submitted consists in the
lact that the registry and money order divi
sions ore placed at opposite extremes of the
building, The relations of these branches of
the service to each other are such that this
separation should be avoided if possible I be
lieve it can be avoided in tha plan under con
sideration.
Money order remittances amounting to up
ward of four million dollars are annualiv re
ceived at this office through the Registry De
partment. Two-thirds of these remittances
come in coin and have to be transferred from
one division to the other.
The same objection already noted in the
stamp department holds good here, only more
so. Communication under the plan proposed
would have to be had either through the pub
lic corridors or across the working floor space
of the interior floor. I would obviate this by
putting the money order departmental the
corner of Seventh and Mission streets instead
ol at the corner of Seventh and Stevenson
L nder such an arrangement it would be possi
ble to provide means of communication between
the two divisions which would be both safe
and convenient To do this would necessitate
the transfer of .... ihe offices now placed to the
right of the main entrance. l know of no
objection to such transfer. There is still another
detect in the proposed plans for the money
order division No provision is made for a
money order lobby. Such 8 :i apartment is in
dispensable in a properly equipped postoffice.
as otherwise desks and writing materials for
the accommodation of the public in filling out
applications, etc.. would have to be placed in
the main corridors.
I would further invite attention to the fact
that no place Is designated upon the plan
under consideration for lock-boxes These
mieht be placed in the partition which sepa
rates the interior floor space from the public
lobby, on the Stevenson-street side of the build
ing.
.nc general plan of the rear driveway, mail
ing-platform, location of registry division and
working space of main office door under the
skylight I think pood. I would, however
eliminate the toilet to the right of the Mission
street entrance and include the space so saved
in a roomy vault for the use ol the registry di
vision, pushing the registry lobby at the same
time over i*> the other side.
1 presume the plan is to Rive the central floor
space to the distribution forces of the office In
that ease I would place tne city delivery divi
sion on the Stevenson-street side and utilize
the space on the Mission-street side of the
cential area for the mailing and foreign divi
sions. The superintendents of these two di
visions need offices.
To meet this necessity I suggest that the .'pace
within the general area on the side of the ele
vator be partitioned off so as to provide four
additional rooms. These would be utilized re
spectively for records, superintendent of
mails, superintendent of city delivery and di
rectory clerks. The two , superintendents
would be advantageously located for tbe super

vision of their respective departments and
would at the same time be easily reached by
the public.
In order to more fully embody my ideas of a
proper working plan for the Postoftice in this
City I beg: to hereto append a rough diagram
based upon your alternative sketch. It would
serve to show in a general way the allotments
and subdivisions of floor space which will lv
my judgment best subserve the interests of the
postal department at this point. â¢ lYf-Y:
You will observe that 1 have, in order to
make room for the money order division,
shortened the public lobby running parallel
with Seventh street, and which is extended
upon your plan to the Mission-street walls. I
offset this by bringing the public lobby which
runs parallel to Mission street through to the
Seventh-street wall. '... â 
I would suggest, however, that the space lost
at this point, which I have marked with a red
star upon my diagram, be given to the cashier's
and stamp divisions unless it be absolutely
necessary to leave it open lor the admission of
lien into the public lobby. .
'{rusting you will not consider me Intrusive
in this matter, and assuring you that I am
only anxious to co-operate with your honor
able department in securing for San Francisco
a postofliee establishment which will meet the
wants of this people for the next half century
to come, 1 remain, yours very respectfully,
Frank McCoppin, Postmaster.
In reply to this letter the Postmaster re
ceived a communication from Mr. Aiken,
dated at Washington, March 27, thanking
him for his suggestions and outlining ad
ditional changes in the plans. Postmaster
McCoppin replied to this letter on April
7, four days alter its arrival and after he
hail carefully gone over the plans again.
lie did not like the second plan and be
said so. The substitution by Mr. Aiken
of six main entrances to the Postoffice for
three, as first intended, did not meet with
the approval of the Postmaster. He said
in his reply that the change would break
up the floor space and render it more diffi
cult to secure arrangements which, in bis
judgment, were necessary for the conven
ience of the postal service. The two best
rooms on the lloor, for instance â those at
the corner of Seventh and Mission and
Seventh and Stevenson streets respec
tivelyâ be so isolated as to be out of
touch with other divisions and to that ex
tent illy adapted for the service contem
plated. The Postmaster ventured the
further criticism that two minor entrances
facing on the same street would give a
less imposing effect architecturally than
might be derived from one. The Post
master emphasized his former suggestions
as to interior arrangements and declared
that he was exceedingly anxious that the
proposed building should be so arranged
as to meet the requirements of the postal
service of San Francisco for the next fifty
years.
Now the department will have to fur
nish some other excuse for the long delay
in commencing work on the Postolfice.
An effort will be made to have the Cali
fornia delegation at Washington force the
department to begin the work without
further delay.
DEATH ON A TRESTLE
R. H. Green Run Down and Killed
Yesterday by the San Jose
Express.
Two Little Girls Witness the Accident
and Say That the Whistle Was
Not Blown.
C. H. Green, 75 years of age, bowed
under the weight of his years and dim of
eye, was struck down by the San Jose
express at the corner of Day street and
railroad crossing yesterday afternoon at
3:13 o'clock, and received injuries from
which death resulted in the course of half
an hour.
The old man was the proprietor of a
hardware-store at 13-8 Valencia street,
and at the time of the accident was re
turning to his store alter delivering an
j order of goods to a customer. He passed
! up Uay street to the railroad track and
climbed a 15-foot embankment in order to
cross a trestle which spans a deep and
dusty chasm. He had just reached the
trestle and was about to start across when
the express train shot around a curve and
bore down upon him.
He did not see nor hear the train until
it Tras within a few yards of him, and then
it was too late and he was struck and
hurled down the embankment. As soon
as possible Engineer Algere brought his
train to a standstill, and backed up to
where the injured man lay unconscious
and bleeding. He was picked up and
placed in a baggage-car, and the train hur
ried on to the Valencia-street station.
Upon making the station Green was carried
into the waiting-room, and a physician
hastily summoned from St. Luke s Hos
pital, a few blocks away, but when he ar
rived it was found that the injured man
was dead.
The Coroner was then notified and Dep
uty Coroners Hallet and McGinnis took
charge of the remains and removed them
to the Morgue. An examination of the
body disclosed the fact that deceased had
sustained a fracture of the skull at the
base, death resulting from hemorrhage of
th c brain.
There were two witnesses to the sad ac
cident, and although they are both girls of
tender years, they are nevertheless ex
ceedingly bright and are competent wit
nesses. Their names are Alma Voightand
Dediama Millard, the former residing at
122 and the latter at 306 Valley street.
Both girls are inclined to biame the en
gineer and fireman for the accident, as
they say that the engine's whistle was not
blown nor its bell sounded.
"When we first saw Mr. Green he was
slowly walking along the track towards
trestle," said Miss Millard, speaking about
the accident last evening, "and both of us
girls noticed the danger in which he was
placing himself in starting across the
trestle. In event a train comes along
while you are crossing the span there is no
way of escape, and death is inevitable.
We were just thinking and talking
about his danger when the train came
whizzing around the curve, and naturally
we became frightened and covered up our
eyes with our hands. We took our hands
away from our faces, however, b_for_ the
train struck Mr. Green, and saw him make
a kind of a leap for safety just a second
before he was knocked down. The train
struck him and when we looked again he
was lying part way down the embank
ment, blood flowing from an awful cut in
his head. -Â.-.
"We waited until the train backed up
and carried him away, and then we ran
home, as we were badly frightened, being
unused to such horrible sights."
Mrs. Green, widow of deceased, who is
also over 70 years of age, is prostrated with
grief owing to the death of her husband.
"We were married over fifty years ago,"
she said, "and just to think' that I will
never see him again. Well, thank God, I
am very sickly and have not long to live
and so I will soon be with him. I did not
know he was dead," she continued, "until
an undertaker called and asked me if I
had as yet employed any one to look after
mv husband's funeral. Just think, the
undertakers were informed as to my hus
band's death even before I was and I
think that it is a shame.
"We have no children of our own no
one but an adopted daughter, and she is
all I have left, but I suppose that I must
be contented and await the day when I
too will leave this world and join my hus
band in the great beyond." .v, ;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 1896.
LAWYERS GO TO LISTEN.
The Martin Case Attendance Is
Increasing Day by
Day.
SHARP FENCING BY COUNSEL
Experts in Handwriting and an Expert
at Testifying Entertain the
Audience.
Judge Daingerfield's court has developed
remarkable powers of attraction with the
progress of the Martin case. No recent
civil case has been contested as has been
this against the Southern Pacific Railroad
to recover damages for having expelled a
passenger from a train at an out-of-the
way station because the passenger's signa
ture, written at the request of the con
ductor, did not .seem to agree with the
signature as written on the ticket at the
time of its purchase.
It is not so much the elements in the
action itself that create the interest, nor
the quality or character of the evidence,
but the contest, now with broadswords
and now with rapiers, of the giants who
sit on the opposite sides of the counsel
table. â¢ ~fy-

attorneys, by whom the courtroom has
been crowded for the past few days.
The little tincture of acrimony" between
the opponents in which the trial began
has sauced each day's proceedings ns it
went, and the confidence with which its
outcroppings were expected ' went far
toward putting a premium on the seating
capacity of the courtroom. Each inch of
the proceedings has been contested, not
hotly, as the term goes, but coldly anu
scientifically.
Many of the lawyers of the Fair will
case dropped in during the day, George A.
Knight sitting at General Barnes' "table
and Reuben ri. Lloyd at that of Mr. Del
mas through a large part of the morning
session.
The defense attacked the plaintiff on his
morals and his handwriting yesterday â
morals in the morning, handwriting in the
afternoon; morals through the medium of
the Midway Plaisance and handwriting
through Carl Eisenschimmel and a few oth
ers. The interest was about equally di
vided between the twoâ the Midway and
Eisenschimmel.
It was undertaken to be shown that the
plaintiff (Martin) had committed the
grave error of having visited the Midway
Plaisance during his visit to the City.
Police Sergeant Davis had seen him there.
There was a long struggle between
counsel as to the relevancy and admis
sibility of the evidence and of the qualifi
cation of the police sergeant to testify as
to thechaiacterof the place. The sergeant
said he knew its character, had himself
seen the Oriental muscle dance there, and
also had seen men and women frequent
ing the boxes.
"What was the character of the
women?" asked General Barnes.
"Your Honor will see where that is lead
ing us," said Mr. Delmas, after he had
made his objection. "The witness has
seen fifty women there perhaps. Under
cross-examination we will want to know
their names, their residences, and how he
knows their character â we will have the
right, I mean, to put fifty questions con
cerning each of the fifty women. There is
no end to it." "<~<yy '. >
But the question was allowed. The
witness answered very promptly that he
did not know their character.
William Ross of the passenger depart
ment went on the stand to explain the
methods of the ticket-scalper and the
relations of the railroad company to him.
At every point Attorney Delmas offered
objection on the ground of irrelevancy;
the ticket-scalper had nothing to do with
the case. But still the questions were
allowed, the court volunteering an excep
tion. In most cases Delmas would reply.
"We do not except."
The field of inquiry widened. Mr. Ross,
encouraged, amplified his answers and
was explaining at length how the ticket
scalper gave a guarantee that money
should be refunded in case the ticket was
lifted, and how faith was generally broken
i and the traveler wound up in his (Ross')
oflice with a grievance.
"Your Honor," said Delmas, "we have
the full history of the relationship of this
railroad company and the scalper, of the
legislation one way and another at Sacra
mento, of the bribery and pollution that
have characterized that story and brought
disgrace upon the State, and finally, when
the smoke of their battles has cleared
away, of how we found the lion and the
lamo lying down together that they
might with greater comfort to themselves
fleece and shear the other lambs, j Are we
to have the whole story?"
t General Barnes rose up. "The trouble
j seems to be that the character of this de
i fense is not understood," be said. "We
j propose to show that tlm plaintiff had this
j game in hand from the beginning; that
he put himself under suspicion of the
agents of the company for the purpose of
being put off the train and bringing a
suit here for the recovery of damages in
the sum of $75,000; that "he went to the
ticket-brokers in this City and offered to
sell or trade his ticket* and that was re
ported to the office of the company, and
attention was so directed toward him ; that
when asked to write his signature he made
such a burlesque of it that no bank would
think of cashing a draft upon it when
compared to the signature on the ticket;
that when put off the train he was getting
what he himself was planning for. It is
for this reason that we wish to show the
methods of the scalping, businessâ is
preliminary to the other."
"If this be the purpose of the inquiry,"
said Delmas, "to show that this plaintiff is
practicing a deception it passeth under
standing why they don't show it. If he is
a fraud they should prove it; if he tried to
sell his ticket to the broKers they should
prove it; if he wrote his name purposely
in conflict with his proper signature they
should prove it. It is certainly not to the
purpose to wander through all the ramifi
cations of the scalping war. If they do
prove it they make a complete defense and
the case is at end, and this plaintiff will
receive nothing at the. hands of the jury,
as he should receive nothing. If they
prove it they prove that this man deceived
us as he deceived the conductor.
"On the other hand, whatever the dis
crepancy in the handwriting of the plain
tiff, if it occurred honestly in the course of
this transaction out of which this case
grows, the plaintiff is entitled to damages.
And how are we to reconcile the state
ments herein made concerning the
plaintiff's deliberate attempt to defraud
the defendant with the latter's offer to
him of compromise."
General Barnes here brusauely inter
rupted and denied that any reference had
been made to compromise except the
statement- of Mr. Ross on the witness
stand as to the offer of compensation for
the loss of time. That was within the time
limit allowed by law.
Mr. Delmas recalled an. instance where
General Barnes had himself referred to
this offer. He should not then complain
of his (Delmas') use of it. The fact was,
he said, the big corporation was willing to
recognize and pay damages provided they
were very small. " ... . : _
Judge Daingerfield allowed the ques
tions as asked, reasoning somewhat as fol
lows :
"The evidence is here that the plaintiff
is considerable of a traveler. The same
set of circumstances applying to the case
of some other man who had traveled little
would properly exclude this line of ques
tioning. But we must suppose that he is
familiar with the requirements of rail
roads in selling the class of ticket he held
and the precautions deemed necessary to
be taken by the railroad company against
imposition and loss through the traffic in
the same."
Ana so the inquiry was continued
through a long explanation of the scalp
in _ business. ..
Witnesses as to handwriting kept the
stand all the afternoon. George Grant,
acting teller of the Nevada Bank, and W.
A. Stinson, paying teller at the Anglo-
California Bank, testified that they would
not pay money on any draft confronted
with such discrepancy of signatures as the
various writings of plaintiff exhibited.
Carl Eisenschimmel, expert on handwrit
ing as well as expert witness, amused and
entertained the crowded courtroom with a
detailed study of the signatures he had
made. He presented enlarged photo
graphs of the various signatures, and from
, the up and down strokes thus clearly
shown descanted on the "habits" of the
writer which the lines conveyed to him.
Having explained how the pen must
have been held to write the characters,
and how certain of the sinews labored
harder in the performance than others, he
explained that all of them must have been
written by the same man, and that all ex
cept those on the ticket were evidently an
attempt to disguise the hand.
Cross-examining, Delmas called atten
tion, to the differences between the signa
tures on the two sides of the ticket, one
using the Greek "c," the other not. Here
a long discussion arose as to which was the
front and which the back of the ticket.
The court suggested to the witness that
he use the words obverse and reverse to
distinguish them. V :Yyyyy.yy>Y~
"We will call them 'front and back';
that is plain Eaglish," said Delmas.
A draft was submitted to the witness,
dated previous to the date of the ticket,
which bore the signature and the name of
a bank in the plaintiff's, handwriting and
which presented the very differences in
style and formations of capital letters as
marked the signature in question, and
upon which the witness had lain stress as
showing conclusively an attempt to dis
guise the hand.
Eisenschimmel at once said the writing
was by the same hand, but declared this,
too, was an attempt to disguise the hand.
"You mean to say that this man has
disguised his hand on a draft to be pre
sented to his own bankers for payment? - '
The witness after some quibbling de
clared flatly, "I say now this is not a dis
guised hand, but simply a change of style."
I The case will be resumed , to-day.

NO SPLIT IN THE ARMY.
Brigadier Keppel Says Seced
ing Salvationists Don't
Count.
NO NATIONAL PREJUDICE.
The American Jurisdiction May Bs
Divided Into Three Command
eries or Sections.
Considerable comment has been called
forth in local Salvationist circles by The
Call's dispatch of yesterday containing a
statement purporting to have been made
by Mr. and Mrs. Ballington Booth. In
brief, the statement imputes to General
Booth an intense aversion to things and
ways American. So far, say the ex
commander and his lady, does the vener
abie general's antagonism extend that he
is about to divide the United States juris
diction of the Salvation Army Into three
sections,' each section having a slice of
Canadian soil tacked to the north of it.
Popular rumor went further yet, assum
ing that the general's intention was to
divide the United States Salvationist
workers so as to prevent anything like
national feeling among them, so far as
their work might be concerned. To more
effectually put down any approach to a
distinctively American branch of the
Salvation Army it was said the general
would have each American district em
brace a small portion of Canadian territory,
in which the jurisdictional headquarters
would be located and. to which all dona
tions would have to be sent after the ex
penses of each branch had been paid. The
statement of ex-Commander and Mrs.
Ballington Booth would seem, to some ex
tent, at least, to bolster up these flying
reports.
Brigadier Keppel, though a busy man
is a good conversationist. His attention
being called to the statement of Mr. and
Mrs. Ballington Booth he read it through
carefully before making any remark.
'â¢This," he said at length, "you must
understand, is our first information on
the subject mentioned. Until we receive
orders directly from London we cannot
allow any newspaper statements to influ
ence us. At present, also, it seems to me,
it would be premature to express an opin
ion, except in a purely personal way. It
is only my personal view of the matter â
mv individual opinionâ that I am able to
give.
"First of all, there has been no 'split' in
the army. Its history, like that of every
other organization, is dotted wit.i deser
tions and secessions; but in the Salvation
Army there has been no corporate division
commander, and Mrs. Ballington Booth
was immensely popular. Both possess
fascinating personal attractions and a de
votedness to their work which gained
for them the respect as well as the
affection of their subordinates. Yet, when
they left the army their following was
small and comparatively insignificant.
Brigadier Fielding of Chicago was, per
haps the most important member of the
army to secede with them. Major Glenn
of New York, the cashier and accountant
of the New York headquarters, Staff Cap
tain Pattie Watkins, whose singing has
made her famous, and two or three other
captains, with a scattering detachment of
the rank and file, make up the sum total.
Major Glenn has sent in his submission to
the army and asked for readmission with
in its ranKs, and I have heard that Captain
Pattie Watkins has done the same.
"Now. as to the division of the Ameri
can jurisdiction, It would appear that
General Booth, in considering tne matter,
was swayed rather by ideas of conveni
ence and facility of travel than by any no
tion of national feeling. The United
States is too large a country for one com
mander.
"During the nine years of Ballington
Booth's incumbency he visited the Pacific
Coast only once. 1 would not wish to be
quoted as saying anything definite, nor
can I speak with precision in this connec
tion; but I think the American jurisdic
tion will be divided into three comman
deries, one embracing the Pacific Slope
with British Columbia, perhaps, thrown
in, with the commander's headquarters in
San Francisco; another comprising the
territory west from Detroit to the Rocky
Mountains, with headquarters at Chicago,
and one covering the Atlantic Coast, with
its center in New York City.
"Perhaps North Dakota, Montana and
some other Northern States and Territories
may continue to be governed from Toronto,
owing to the greater facility with which
they can be reached and visited from that
point; but I have no reason to believe that
such will be the case. _ do not believe,
however, that General Booth wishes to
render the army odious to loyal citizens of
any country. Though governed from Eng
land it is not English; nor is it American.
It is a world-wide agency for good, and is
entirely free Irom all national limitations.
If 'policy' can be mentioned in connection
with a work whose only object is the salva
tion of -souls, this, it seems to me, is the
only safe policy for the army to pursue."
When asked as to defections trom the
army on this coast the genial brigadier re
plied: Yy
"They have been few and unimportant.
In San Jose twenty-three of our soldiers
had seceded, and yesterday (Sunday) the
ringleaders came back to their old al
legiance. In this City we have three or
four ex-soldiers in what is called the 'Gos
pel Army.' There is another band of three
or four men known as 'Jesus' Army,' of
which I personally know little, save that
its moving spirit is a man of deep piety
with a fervent Jove of souls. . None ot his
adherents are deserters from the Salvation
Army, so far as I have learned.
"To sum up the whole matter," con
cluded Brigadier Keppel, as he rose in
answer to a request from one of the clerks,
"the grand eld army is not divided: there
is no split in it: it continues to receive di
rections as to its plan of work from Eng
land: but its field is the world and its only
sovereign the God whose majesty it seeks
to serve." ,;;;';

lating the pool ordinance. Mullen was
arrested about two Weeks ago for the same
offense, and Judge Low dismissed the
case. He takes up a position outside the
Insleside racetrack fence, and has a crowd
of newsboys and messenger- boys around
him. They bet their nickels and dimes
with Mullen on the races, and he makes
up his books on each race, charging his
commission after the results are Known by
watching the races from the branches of a
tree.
The spirit of gambling is infused into
the minds of the boys by the doings of
such men as Mullen, who has openly de
fied the police since Judge Low dismissed
the case against him. The police will
push the case against him this time with
all their vigor, and hope to be able to
secure a conviction from some other Judge.

ASKS FOR A LIGHTSHIP
The Chamber of Commerce Pe
titions the California
Delegation.
Thomas B. Reed Also Will Be Re
quested to Work for the Nicar
j-gua Canal Bill.
The board of trustees of the Chamber of
Commerce met at 2 p. m. yesterday, and
considered many subjects of importance to
the City and port of San Francisco.
Among them were the extension of the
belt railroad south of Market street, the
obtaining of an appropriation for a light
ship in place of the present inefficient
whistling-buoy, the establishment of a
board of arbitration with legal power, as
in the Chambers of Commerce of New
York and London; the adoption of official
certificates of competency, to be given of
ficers in the merchant service in respect to
navigation and seamanship; the establish
ment of a United States department of
commerce, with a representative in the
Cabinet. Referred to the quarterly meet
ing of the chamber on Tuesday, April 21.
The official, honorary certificate of mem
bersnip for "eminent public services" was
presented to Colonel Wendell, United
Stat es Engineers. The chamber only per
mits these certificates in rare instances,
and they are esteemed an honor which
only eminent p uhlic service can obtain. .
A communication was received from one
of the local navigation schools and from j
one of the commercial papers of the City,
requesting the Chamber of Commerce to j
appoint experts in navigation and seaman- 1
ship, who would issue certificates of com- |
petency, after due examination, under the I
sanction of the chamber.
lt was resolved that a letter be sent to
the Califo/nian delegation in Congress re
questing them to endeavor to procure the
establishment of a lightship in San Fran
cisco Bay, near the site of the present
whistling buoy. It was further resolved
that a letter he sent to Thomas B. Reed,
earnestly requesting his urgent endeavor ]
for the passage of the Nicaragua canal bill.
Thirty-one new firms and individuals
were elected to membership, which now
numbers 440.
The letter to Mr. Reed ran as follows :
Hon. Thomas B. Heed, Speaker of the House of
Representativesâ Sir: Tne Chamber of Com
merce of San Francisco respectfully but
urgently request that you will aid the enact
ment of the Nicaragua Canal bill in the Fifty
fourth Congress at the earliest.possible date,
permitting its prompt consideration by the
House of Representatives when reported by
the committee having it in charge. The
canal question has been before Congress for
several session, and has been thoroughly dis
cussed. Both political parties have pro
nounced at National conventions in its favor.
us have also Presidential candidates in their
letters of acceptance.
The development of our commerce, our in
dustries, our international influence, our
j political and military safety, all demand its
prompt construction under control of our
Government. It will no more injure vested
interests than the Erie canal or the St. Mary's
canal connecting both the Great Lakes. On
the contrary; like them, it will create a rapid
development on the west coast of the United
States, which will aid inland transportation
interests. It will rapidly increase our mer
chant marine and open the Pacific Ocean to
the Mississippi Valley and to our Gulf States.
It will double the efficiency of our naval
forces and greatly promote our foreign com
merce. - '
Your former residence on this coast and your
knowledge of its necessities encourage our citi
zens to hope that you will now aid them in this
patriotic public duty.
Tnis Chamber of Commerce, largely repre
senting business interests of the Pacific States
and Territories, is confident that you will not
permit the fair and prompt consideration of
this important measure to be longer postponed,
to the serious detriment of our country. With
assurances of our high respect, we subscribe
ourselves your fellow-citizens,
. The Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco. '
