Captain O'Brien and the crew of the
vessel are known to bÂ«. aboard, but the i
whereabouts of General Calixto Garcia
and the 170 men who went out on the
steamer i? in doubt. It is said that there
has been treachery somewhere, and the
exact destination of . the vessel off
the Cuban coast waÂ« known to the
Spanish officials in this country, and
Captain-General Weyler was fully in
formed of the place where an attempt
would be made to land the cargo of the
vessel. At any rate the:, attempt to land
was a failure. ./ jÂ£|^R ftfflÃ
The attempt was made at night, near
Cape C< rrenies. The Bermuda was show
ing no lights. Suddenly several Spanish
gunboats were sighted, bearing down upon
the Bermuda. They also. had concealed
their h>ht< and were dose at hand when
seen: The Bermuda male all steam and

Garcia and his men may have landed at
this time before any attempt was made to
land war material, and again they may be j
etill board the vessel.

arms and ammunition at Puerto Cortez,
Honduras. In an interview with a repre
sentative of the United Press he said :
"The fact that the Bermuda was at
Puerto Cortez is not news. We have
known it several days. She landed her
men and cargo in Cuba safely. She then
proceeded to Puerto Cortez and took a

the Pinar del Rio line between Marie and j
Majana. The authorities declared the line

The Government urged the â¢ corres

The Latest exploit oi t be = rebel com
m3nder-in-chief was to enter the capital
of Santa Clara province. His forces
swarmed into the city, filling the plaza.
Mounted guards. .patrolled the streets from
midnight till morning and secured shoes,
clothing and considerable ammunition.
General Bazan, surprised with a few troops
in the cit\ , rushed about dressed in under
clothing only. He select*- 1 the roof of

tained remarks which were con
strued into an admission of
an intention to join the insurgents. Wil- .
liams furnished a copy of the letter to the
only American correspondent here having
close relations with Weyler. Before the
letter reached tiie palace the officials said
Djgart would probably be released, owing
to lack of evidence. They now declare the
chain of evidence is compete. Dygart will
be treated as a prisoner of war. The Gov
ernment claims a gun was found ten feet
away when Dycart was arrested. He de
nies this.
Three prisoners of war were sho in the
Cabanas prison last weeH. One had his
arm in a sling, as tne result of a wound,
when captured. Nine political prisoners
were deported during last month. What
becomes of all the prisoners of war and
suspects arrested it is impossible to learn.
The recent affair at Bainoa. which Gen
eral Melonizo reports as a brilliant victory,
resulting in the insurgents losing eignteen
men, is now said to have been similar to
the Delgado affair, in which Melquizo also
figured. The only one of the eighteen who
fought was a negro, who, though shot in
the head, seized a machete, nearly killed
the Spanish captain and wounded three
others before oeing finished.

COlO.VÂ£i JAREZ DJE.S.
Wound Received While Escaping From \
a Prison Prom Fatal. â¢
ST. LOUIS, Mo., April ' I.â Colonel i
Placca Jarez.who was a few months as:o i
in command of a Cuban regiment, died at j
the city hospital here last night from !
blood-poisoning brought about by a bullet
wound received is escaping from a Spanish
prison.
Jarez was a sugar planter in the province
of Pinar del Rio,*and with his son en- ;
listed in the Cuban army at the first out- ;
break of the war. The father was given
command of a regiment, and the son, j
Gonzales, was placed over a company in ;
Maceo's command, where he still remain?, j
On November 21 Colonel Jarez and seven
of his men were captured by the Spanish \
and sent to jail at Pinar del Rio. On Feb
ruary 26 the prisoners attacked the guards j
and escaped. .
Colonel Jarez, badly wounded in the
right leg, made his way to the south coast
and embarked in a small boat. He was
picked up in an exhausted condition by
the American schooner Annie M, bound
from Aspinwall for New Orleans, and
eventually made his way to this city. He
was sent to a city hospital on Thursday
last, blood poisoning having resulted from
lack of proper tereatment of his wound.
Colonel Jarez' last words to those at
his bedside were, "Send word to my son
to fight till the end for the cause."
The deceased was 61 years old and was
born in Mexico. Twenty years ago he
lived in Arizona and did valuable service
in aiding the Government troops to fight
the Apaches.

ranged in this vicinity. Angel Figuerdo,
general manager for the insurgents, sta
tioned at this port, has made several
trips up the coast during the past few
! weeks and returned this morning from Bis
cayne Bay.
Large quantities of arms and munitions
of war have been smuggled out of the city
on the schooners Deliie and Pearl. Last
night the schooner Martha, owned by J.

HOW THE JOB WAS DONE.
They Brutally Clubbed the Mes
senger and Then Blew
Open the Safe.
GOT AWAY WITH ABOUT $30,000
Terrified the Passengers for an Hour
and Finally Ran Off With
the Engine.
ST. LOL IS, Mo., April I.â The St. Louis
and San Francisco fast express from the
West was held up at 3 o'clock thig morning
near Richland by three masted men. Just
as the train was approaching Richland the
engineer saw a bright red light on the
tracK. He reversed the engine and stopped
the train.
As the train slowed up a man sprang
into the cab with a Winchester rifle in his
hand and ordered the engineer and fire
man to hold up their hands, an order that
was promptly obeyed.
The robber then made the eneineer
mount the platform of the express-car and
tell the messenger to open the door.
Two more robbers, both masked, had
made their appearance beside the track as
soon as the train stopped. When the mes
senger refused to open the door of the ex
press car they beean to fire through it and
to threaten to blow up the car with dyna
mite. Then the messenger weakened and
opened the door.
The rohbers entered the car, but found
the safa locked. The messenger -was or
dered to open it, but said he could not. as
he did not know the combination. The
robbers evidently did not believe him, for
they tried to force him to do so, striking
him over the head with the butt end of a
gun and seriously injuring him.
Finally they went to work on the safe
themselves and succeeded in blowing it
open with dynamite. It took them nearly
an hour to do this, and all the time some
one of them kept firing their guns to
frighten the passengers.
When the safe was opened at last they
stcured its contents, mounted the engine,
which they cut loose from the train, and
started down the track in it. About one
eighth of a mile east of the train they left
the engine, mounted horses tied near by
and galloped off into the darfcness.
The amount they secured is variously
stated at anywhere between $10,000 and"
$100,000. A conservative estimate is
$30,000. In their flight they dropped a
bag containing $1700.
As soon as tne news could be sent of the
robbery a posse started out from Lebanon
in pursuit of the thieves. As the train
men were able to give a good description
of them, it is probable that they will be
caught.

LEBANON, Mo., April I.â An hour
after tne robbery was reported here a
posse made up of 100 citizens started in
pursuit of the robbers. About 11 o'clock
| a member of the posse returned. He says
i they found in the 5 woods west of wnera
the robbery took place two checks, one for
$4400 and one for $15, and also an envelope
containing ass bill. Hence it is supposed
that the cutting loose of the engine was
merely a -blind and- that the robbers
jumped off within a few hundred yards of
the train and took : horses and came wen
across the country. At least this is the
, theory the officers are proceeding on. : ;

TRAIS ROBBEKS FOILED.

and lu-o Escape. *r\ *â ':.:.'
BREMEN, Ind., April Lâ Five men at
tempt to hold up the westbound Baltimore
and Ohio limited express at 4:30 o'clock
this morning. The gang of * robbers
boarded the train. at Garrett, and when
this side of this city a few miles, robbed a
passenger, Theodore Beilstein of Chicago,
of his gold watch and money, and then
threw him from the train. It was the
gang's intention to hold up the train some
where between Walkerton, and Bremen,
as a large marsh west of Bremen affords
them a good opportunity. Bellstein re
covered sufficiently to walk to Garrett and
notify the officials, who wired the . opera
tor here and the night police, with several
: men.went to .the depot armed, and when
the train arrived a desperate battle took
place. Three of the robbers were arrested
and placed in : , the Bremen, jail. One of
them is mortally .wounded. . A posse of
men is now searching; the country for the
two highwaymen who escaped.
OPPOSED BY MRS. M'KEE
General Harrison's Daughter
Will Not Be Present at
His Wedding.
Does Not Wish to See Mrs. Dimmick
Take the Place of Her
Mother.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, April I.â A special
to the Tribune from Indianapolis says: It
has been definitely decided that Mrs. Mc-
Kee will not attend the -wedding of ex-
President Harrison and Mrs. Dimmick in !
New York on Monday next. Friends
volunteer the information that she had ;
been exposed to the measles since she came
to this city, and the physicians advised
against her going to New York.
While this is offered as an excuse for her â 
absence, her friends no longer attempt to
conceal the fact that sne is very much dis- j
appointed in her father's marriage. It is j
not that she is opposed to Mrs. Dimmick,
but because she doeÃ not want any one to
take the place of her mother in the home. !
She will leave here next Tuesday for Bos
ton, and will not come in contact with her j
stepmother at all.
A lady friend of Mrs. McKee said to
night that she would not return here to
visit unless she were called home by such j
an exigency as the sickness of her father, i
While hÂ«r relations are pleasant with him, >
she could not reconcile herself to his mar- )
riage.
Not over twenty-five invitations to the i
wedding have been issued. These went to \
relatives of the ex-President and Mrs. Dim- !
mick and to former members of ex-Presi- !
dent Harrison's Cabinet. After the wed- j
ding General Harrison and his bride will <
leave for Indianapolis. They will return
East in a short time and pass the summer
in the Adirondacks. j
NEITHER TO GET
A DEEP HARBOR
Santa Monica and San
Pedro Appropriations
Defeated.
LOST TO CALIFORNIA.
Huntington's Scheme Fails, but
He Thwarts the People
as Well.
M'LACHLAN'S FRENZIED RAGE.
Scores His Colleagues for Opposing
the Southern Pacific â Frye
Shows His Hand.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â "There
is the devil to pay in the California delega
tion." This was the expressive though
inelegant declaration made by a California
Congressman to a Call correspondent to
day.
"What is the matter?"
"Follow me," said ne, leading the way
to the Rivers and fiarbors Committee
â  room. A watchman was stationed on the
I outside, but within loud voices were heard.
They were considering the San Pedro and I
i Santa Monica harbor appropriations, and j
| were having a veritable "monkey and par
rot time." The matter was iinally settled
by striking out the appropriations for botn
places. Thus Southern California lost
$400,000.
To those who are nnfamiliar with tne
Southern California deep-harbor project,
I it may be well to explain that the Southern
I Pacific tracks in Southern California
I terminate at Santa Monica, where the
railroad has built wharves at a cost of
$1,500,000. Therefore, C. P. Huntington,
through a corps of lobbyists in Washing
ton, is striving to secure from Congress an
appropriation of $3,000,000 to deepen and
otherwise improve the harbor. Senator
Jones of Nevada, who is financially inter
'; ested in the development of Santa Monica.
: is working hand in hand with him toward
' this accomplishment. They have enlisted
the active support of Senator Frye of
\ Maine, president pro tempore of the
Senate, chairman of the Commerce Com
| mittee (which has charge of river and
1 harbor mattsrs), and altogether a power
in the upper branch of Congress.
Two different boards of War Department
engineers have reported that, as between
the two rival sites. San Pedro, twenty
i miles southwest of Los Angeles, is much
i better adapted for a deep harbor than is
Santa Monica, which is eighteen miles
: west of that city and twelve miles distant
i from -San Pedro. Their recommendations
were, in effect, that natural conditions
were against the selection of Santa Monica,
and at the same time made San Pedro
peculiarly adapted for a deep harbor.
Huntington endeavored to counteract the
I effect of these official reports by having
j Southern Pacific Engineers Hood and
I Corthell submit expert testimony directly
I to the contrary.
For the past five or six years Hunting
| ton has tried to induce Congress to make
ian appropriation for improvements at
Santa Monica which by the "continuous
contract" system would ultimately ap-
S proximate $3,000,000. But inasmuch as
! the California Senators and Representa
tives, supported by the almost unanimous
expressions of Southern California peo
| pie, persistently opposed Santa Monica
and stronely favored San Pedro, no appro
priation has been made by Congress for
either place. These were the "outer"'
harbor projects, but the plan for improve
ment of the "inner" harbor at San Pedro,
to cost $392,000, as recommended by the
board of Government Engineers, was not a
subject of controversy, ana it was under
stood that this improvement was desired
by all Southern California people and all
the railroads terminating at LO3 Aneeles.
Senator White, who addressed the Rivers
and Harbors Committee several weeks ago.
with Colonel H. G. Otis and others, who
were here to urge the improvement, made
this statement, and Huntington, who was
present, did not contradict it.
It was generally understood that the
! SoutherD Pacific would not oppose "inner
j harbor" improvements at San Pedro;
I neither would it urge its Santa Monica
project. Representative McLachlan of
Los Angeles, by his energy and influence
with the memoers of the Rivers and Har
bors Committee, succeeded in securing
from them a promise to insert an appro
priation of $3!Â»2,000 for improvements on
the inner harbor at San Pedro. This was
done and McLachlan was greatly elated
and received the congratulations of his
friends and colleagues: but, to his amaze
ment and the astonishment of the entire
California delegation, it was discovered
that Huntington and his asents had been
at work, and the Committee on Rivers and
Harbors had appropriated $100,000 to com
mence a deep-harbor project at Santa
Monica, which would have ultimately cost
$3,000,000.
Huntington's work had bsen done so
quietly that no one nad any idea of what
Ihe wan about. His agent. John Boyd, had
approached the members of the committee
and reported to them that tbe California
delegation as well as almost the unani
mous sentiment of Southern California
people favored this Santa Monica improve
ment. The combine friendly to Hunt
ington was not hard to influence and the
item was inserted.
McLachlan was afraid to antagonize it,
for fear that it might defeat his appro
priation for the "inner" harbor im
provements at San Pedro. He endeav
ored to induce his colleagues from Cali
fornia not to antagonize the Santa
Monica appropriation; but Bowers, Ma
guire and Barham did not heed his wishes.
The former went before the committee
and protested strongly against any money
beinsr appropriated for Huntington's har
bor, declaring that the boards of engineers i
had reported adversely to it, and Southern
California people were almost unanimously
oppo:<ed to it, and were in favor of San
Pedro. Judge Maguire and Representa
tive Barham also talked with individual
members of the committee.
Representative McLachlan was in a
frenzy of rage to-day, and was very bitter
in his denunciation of Bower 3 and Bar
bara. He declared that Barham had no
business to interfere with Southern Cali- i
forma affairs. He indulged in some very j
intemperate language when he referred to j
the "work of Barham. The latter said to !
The Call correspondent to-day :
"Last May I visited both San Pedro and j
Sanva Monica for the express purpose of
informing myself as to the relative merits
of these rival sites, and from personal ob- :
servation concluded that there was no j
comparison between them ; that San i
Pedro was, by all odds, the best place for ;
the deep harbor. I attended a meeting at
L(M Angeles at wnich Senator White and i
Representative McLachlan were present; i
and when, in answering to the toast 'Cali- !
fornia.' I mentioned that I would favor ;
San Pedro for a harbor, there was enthu- j
siastic applause from nearly 2000 citizens,
who were at that meeting. This convinced ;
me that the sentiment was for San Pedro.
"Several days ago members of the
Rivers and Harbors Committee said to me
that Huntington's agents had approaches
them and represented that the California
delegation and California people generally
favored Santa Monica. I told them the
truth as I understood it and have no
reason to regret it. But I did not appear
before the committee, for I have 400 miles
of coastline in my own districts, besides
several rivers, to look after, and did not
seek to interfere with Southern California
affairs. Mr. McLachlan seems to hold me
partly responsible for to-day's result, and j
although he admits that I correctly stated
the attitude of our California people he
blames me in part for defeating San
Pedro's appropriation."
Senator White said to The Call corre
spondent to-night: '"I was very much sur
prised to learn that San Pedro's appropri
ation had been stricken out, merely be
cause an objection was made to the Santa
Monica appropriation. The Government
engineers, California's Representatives
and botu Senators favoring San Pedro and
opposing Santa Monica would seem to j
leave an impartial committee but oiie
course to pursue.' '
Another member of the California dele
gation said : "The River and Harbor Com
mittee seems to be completely subservient
to Huntington's wishes. The fact that
ne or two members of the California
delegation (or tne entire delegation,
for ' that matter) remonstrated against
any appropriation being made for
Santa Monica was no reason for striking
out the provision for the inner harbor
project at San Pedro. They were separate
and distinct propositions and were in no
way related. It merely shows that Hunt
ington is a power, and dominates more
than one committee of Congress. I had
believed until to-day that the Southern
Pacific was not opposed to the San Pedro
inner harbor project, but now am of the
opinion that Huntington had his $3,000,000
Santa Monica item inserted merely to kill
the San Pedro appropriation. It is possi
ble tnat Huntington will attempt to have
his Santa Monica item incorporated when
the bill reaches the Senate. Frye, the
chairman, is Lis friend, and can do about
as be pleases, but in conference committee
it will be expunged again."
The Call correspondent learns to-night
that tne river and harbor bill wiir appro
priate the $250,000 for restraining works at
Daguerre Point on Yuba River. It may
also include $50,000 for dredging San
Pedro. The ieport printed in California
to the effect that the Oakland harbor
would be placed under the continuous
contract system is erroneous.

FIREMEN ARRIVE TOO LATE.
The First Alarm Regarded as a First*
of-April Jokeâ Rumors of Foul
Play Discredited.
CARSON, Nev.. April I.â The people of
Carson were horrified this morning to
learn that during the night John P.
Sweeney's house had been destroyed by
fire and that the occupant had been
roasted to death. About 10 o'clock last
ni^ht a fire was noticed in the direction of
Sweeney's ranch, but little attention was
paid to it. as it was supposed to be sage
brush, ourning. It was nearly midnight
before the fire bell? sounded an alarm, and
even that excited but little interest, as it
was regarded by many as an "April-fool"
joke. The persons who Brat sounded the
alarm were told that they had been duped
and tapped the signal to return. Shortly
afterward word was received that Swee
ney's residence was burning, and the fire
companies hurried to the ranch, two miles
from town, and found the house nearly de
stroyed.
The firemen knew that Sweeney had
been taken home early in the evening and
must be in the burning building, but the
flames bad made such progress that it
was too late to rescue the uniortunate
man. Soon after the engine arrived tha
wall of the southeast corner of the house
burned away and exposed the room In
which Sweeney had perished. As the
smoke was blown back by the breeze his
'body, wrapDed in the flames, could be
â  plainly seen. The beat was so intense
' that an approach nearer than fifty feet
I was impossible, and the firemen were ob
liged to stand idly by as the body was
I slowly consumed, and finally, as the floor
! gave way beneath, they saw the charred
1 corpse roll into the cellar.
Some hours afterward the remains were
recovered. Nothing was left but the trunk.
j The rest of the body was burned to a crisp
I and the bones fell apart as they were
, moved. The charred remains were brought
| to town and an inouest was held, a verdic
; of accidental death being rendered.
Sweeney had a racetrack on his prop
' erty and a long line of training stables for
I fast horses. As the house could not be
i saved, the firemen turned their attention
!to the stables. Alphus, the famou' â¢.-ot
' ting stallion, was liberated, but he be
came so crazed that it required hard work
to keep him from running into the fire.
Hundreds of chickens, which were liber
ated from their houses, flew into the flames
and were burned.
Sweeney was drinking heavily yesterday
and about 6 o'clock some of his friends
took him home and put him to bed. It is
supposed that later in the evening he
lighted a lamp and this being overturned
started the fire. The evidence at the in
quest proved that he was aT>le to get about
the house when the fire broke out, and
j that he attempted to save his valuables.
He had tnrown some of his wife's jewelry
out of a window and a Paris mutual pool
box was clutched in his arms. He went
to bed in the northwest corner of the
house, but died in the southeast room.
Sweeney's wife was in San Francisco,
and a telegram containing the awful news
was sent to ber at once.
John P. Sweeney was a native of Ireland,
and came to this State from Detroit, Mich.
He lias lived in Carson nearly twenty
years. He was a public-spirited man. and
: hi* purse was always ready in any enter
; prise that helped, the town. He erected
the Ozark saloon building and also the
brick building occupied by Cagwin &
Noteware. He brought the horse Gibral
tar to this State to improve the breed of
trotting horses at a time when Gibraltar
held the world's trotting record â 2:22''i.
He then purchased the place known as
the Swift ranchâ the scene of the fireâ and
began breeding fast horses and thorough
bred riolstein cattle. Senator Leland
Stanford offered Sweeney $7000 for Gibral
tar, which was refused. He raised some
fine horses, but met with bad luck on the
turf, and tha slump in the borÂ«e market
was very disastrous. He was once worth
?25,000 or $30,000, but he met with many
j reverses, and finally began drinking
heavily.
Rumors were afloat this evening to the
I effect that he bad been followed home,
j killed, robbed and his dwelling fired. This
idea is credited by no one who knew any
thing regarding the circumstances sur
â  rounding the case. The Coroner's jury,
I however, did not finish its labors and will
| further investigate to-morrow.
CARSOS'S POSTMJSTjER OUSTED.

TEN LIVES LOST
WHILE SLEEPING
Frightful Holocaust in a
Brooklyn Tenement
House.
ONLY SEVEN ESCAPED.
Every Member of Two Italian
Families Perishes in the
Flames.
EVIDENCE CF INCENDIARISM.
The Fire Burned So Fiercely That It
Was Difficult to Save Adjoining
Buildings.
BROOKLYN, N. V., April I.â The four
story brick tenement house at 36 Union
street was burned at 3:30 o'clock this
morning, and ten persons lost their lives.
There were seventeen persons in tbe house
at the time of the tire, seven of whom es
caped.
The following are the names of the
dead: Nicollo Traglia, 50 years of age;
Lina Traglia, 44 years of age; Domino
Traglia, 4 years old; Traglia, 17 days
old; Carnelia Caino, 25 years old; AuÂ«
gustin Buone, 44 years old ; Maria Buone,
35 years old; Sandy Buone, 5 years old;
Johanna Buone. IS months old; Lina
Calabria, 18 years old.
The grouud floor was occupied as a fruit
store by Joseph Esposito, who with his
family lived on the second floor. T c
third floor was occupied by the Traglia
family and the fourth floor by the Buones.
John Calabria, who married Lina Buone
less than a year ago, also lived with the
Buones.
The fire was discovered by a man named
Hoist, who gave the alarm and tried to
arouse the tenants. He kicked in the
street door, but the flames burst out into
bis face, and he had to abandon further
efforts. The hallways and stairs were
then a seething mass of flames. So rapid
ly did the fire spread from a place imme
diately behind the street door, where it
undoubtedly originated, that Hoist saw
there was dancer to the inhabitants of the
adjoining houses, and with the aid of the
police got the tenants into the streets.
In the mean time the occupants of the
burning building were awake and trying
to make theirescape. The Esposito family
made their way to the front windows and
by means of the cornice over tbe front
crossed to tbe building at No. 38 and thence
to the street. The Traglias and the
woman who lived with them on the third
floor apparently did not awaken, and were
burned to death wlthont making any sign
to the watchers in the street.
John Calabria, who married the eldest
daughter of the Buone family, is the only
one of the family alive to tell the tale. He
said he tried to carry bis wife to the win
dow, but could not, and hurt his hands in
K <* l l i : i ir out. He had called for help, but
none came.
The Espositos were aroused by the calls
of "Fire!" and said this morning that five
minutes later they could not have got out
of the building.
The firemen drowned the fire out in a
short time and without damage to the ad
joining buildings.
The bodies were removed by an under
taker at 10 o'clock this morning. They
â¢were badly burned, but not beyond recog
nition.
Tne loss is about $4000 to the building
and its contents. The fire marshal will
make an investigation.
Later in the day Fire Chief Dale said
that John Calabria, whose wife lost her
Jife in the lire, was fully dressed when
seen on the street, and no other occupant
had time to dress. He told two different
stories of nis escape from the house, which
are not considered satisfactory, and he is
under police surveillance until further in
vestigation is made.
BOWERS' KEEN SARCASM
The California Congressman In
troduces Mock Resolutions in
the House.
Says He Is Tired of All This Talk
About Silver Cranks and
Sound Money.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 1.-The
House, in committee of the whole, to-day
completed consideration of the sundry
civil bill, with the exception of the pro
vision for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, which Bingham (R.) of
Pennsylvania desires to amend. Before
the bill shall be reported to the House
there will be a general debate, at the sug
gestion of Hainer (JL\ of Nebraska, upon
the amendment making the provision for
Howard University. Bo it is among the
strong possibilities that the bill will not
be finally disposed of until late to-morrow
afternoon.
The only material amendment made to
the bill to-day aside from the one relating
to the Howard University was the one di
recting the Secretary of War to expend
$75,000 on the new military post estab
lished at Spokane, Wash.
The discussion of the bill was inter
rupted several times by political inter
jections.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio charged the Wil
eon tariff law with being responsible for
the condition of the treasury, which for
bade many necessary appropriations from
being made.
Patterson (D.) of Tennessee replied,
charging the onus of the present condi
tion upon the Republican party and the
gentleman's particular champion, Wil
liam McKinley. In this matter Patterson
â aid, in answer to a question, that he ap
peared as the representative of the admin
tration of Grover Cleveland. This in
spired Bowers of California to indite the
following set of mock resolutions:
Resolved, That in the judgment of this House
the so-culled tilver members of this body are
dangerous cranks, threatening prosperity and
perpetuity of the business interests of the
Ration, and therefore ought to be expelled.
Cries of "\ T ote!" "Vote!"
Bowers â We will vote on the resolu
tions together. The next is:
Resolved, That in the judgment of this House
bo member can be a good Republican or good
Democrat who does not get into the platform
and stsyon the platform inrepted, constructed
and patented by Grover Cleveland and in
which it appears the Republican party has
secured a reversionary interest.
[Laughter.]
Resolved, That, while we consider sliver
members, owners or representatives of silver
mines who come among us seeking to benefit
their mining industry through legislation as
dangerous and a menace to the country, we at
the game time welcome the residents, direct
ors, stockholders and representatives of Na
tional banks who come here as members to
protect and benefit their business; and we
pledge them our earnest support in their ef
forts to establish an elastic currency which
may be increased or diminished in amount as
the interests of bankers may seem to require,
and also in their efforts to be authorized to
issue more currency and less security, to the
end that a system of "sound money" may be
established, every dollar of which shall be re
deemed in gold purchased by sale of United
States bonds, in accordance with the new
system of "sound finance."
Barhamâ Mr. Chairman, I join my col
league in askinpr unanimous consent for
present consideration of those resolutions.
Bowersâ The resolutions are before the
House.
Grosvenor â The gentleman from Cali
fornia had better look out or he may be
taken in earnest. He may have some con
stituents who will not understand the sar
casm of those resolutions. [Laughter.]
Bowersâ Well, Mr. Chairman, I will
take chances with my constituents. My
constituents understand that the miner
and silver member have as good a right
to come here and work for the interest of
men who dig the gold and silver out of
the hills as the banker has to come here
and work to protect his banking interest.
There are two sides to this question, and
I have got a little tired of this talk about
"silver cranks" as men who threaten the
interests of the country. You have not got
any business interests. They went to the
devil long ago under your "sound money"
system. [Laughter.]
SEX ATE PROCEEOIXGS.
Call's Cuban Resolutionâ Perkins Talks
for American Shipping.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â ln the
Senate to-day Call (D.) of Florida intro
duced a joint resolution reciting the con
tinual violations of the usages and rules of
war in Cuba, the inhuman and brutal out
rages on men, women and childen and
directing that an adequate naval force of
the United States shall be immediately sent
to Cuba as shall be sufficient to protect
(by force if necessary) citizens of
the United States in Cuba from
wrong and from the violation of the
treaty obligations; also requesting the
President to communicate this resolution
to the Government of Spain and to inform
that Government that the United States
will forcibly intervene to protect the
rights of American citizens and in the in
terest of civilization if there shall be a re
currence of murder and outrage or of the
shooting or putting to death of prisoners
of war. It was laid on the table.
Morgan (D.) of Alabama gave notice i
that he would next Tuesday call up the \
resolution offered by him on the 9tjj of
Marcb instructing the Committee on Pa- j
cific Railroads to report back the bill m- i
troduced by him and referred to the com
mittee, giving to the Court of Appeals of
the District of Columbia jurisdiction over
suits upon the liens of railway corpora
tions.
The postoffice appropriation bill was i
taken up, the question being on the
amendment reported by the Appropriation
Committee allowing * $80,000 additional
compensation to the Oceanic Steamship
Company for carrying the mails from San
Francisco to New Zealand and New South
Wales. Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin argued
against the amendment.
In the course of a colloquy as to the
subsidies paid by England to mail steam
ship companies," Perkins (R.) of California
declared that as an American citizen he
favored the fostering of American ship
ping as against English shipping. Eng- j
land, France and Russia had last year, he I
said, given $18,000,000 in postal subsidies,
but his friend from Wisconsin (Vilas)
would not give a dollar to American ship
ping excepting the postage.
At the suggestion of Allison (R.) of
lowa, chairman of the Committee on Ap
propriations, the amendment was aiiowtd
to go over without action until to-morrow.
THE NICARAGUAN TROUBLE
Critical Point of the Revolution
Thought to Have Been
Reached.
The Ultimatum of the Liberals Is That
President Zelaya Must Leave
the Country.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â Central
Americans in Washington think that the
critical point of the Nicaraguan revolution
has been reached and the next move will
either involve Honduras and Salvador in
the dispute or settle the matter in favor of
the revolters against the assumption of
dictatorship of President Zelaya.
This belief is founded on the very pe
culiar political conditions resulting from
Zelaya's abandonment of the Liberal party
which elected him to the Presidency, the
strong sentiment against dictatorships in
all the republics and the weakness of the
clerical or church party in the more popu
lous sections of Nicaragua.
It is predicted that the Clericals will
not make any great sacrifices in support of
Zelaya's dictatorship,. as he is one of their
bitterest enemies, and it is said has only
sought their support for his personal
aggrandizement.
The ultimatum of the Liberals is that
Zelaya shall leave the country, turning
over the executive department to Vice-
President Boca and the old Cabinet until
the next legal election can take place, and
unless this is shortly agreed to it is the
impression that opponents of the Clericals
in Honduras and Salvador may join the
Liberals inj their effort to uphold the
Nu-araguan constitution.
It is said that Zelaya has been offered
the vacant post of Minister to Washing
ton, provided hepromptly accepts the ulti
matum. On the other hand, Zelaya de
mands the surrender of Vice-President
Boca and all the Liberal leaders and their
trial before a military tribunal, and this
extreme demand arouses the Liberal sym
pathy of the other two republics that were
parties to the recent alliance of Amapala.
It is said that there is no possible contin
gency under which Guatemala and costa
Rica can be drawn into tbe controversy.
PACIFIC CABLE RIVALRY.
Charter and Subsidy Seeking Companies
Defeat Each Other and Delay
the Project.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â The
rivalry between the two companies seek
ing a charter and a subsidy for the con
struction of a Pacific cable has resulted for
the time being at least in the failure of
eiiher company to secure the prize.
The sub-committee of the Senate Com
mittee on Foreign Relations reported to
the full committee a bill along the lines of
that proposed by the Scrymser Company
of New \ork, but left the name blank so
that the full committee could act thereon.
This bill was considered the best proposi
tion because for the same bonus larger ad
van taces were offered to the Government.
When the proposition came up in the
committee this morning the Spalding ad
vocates found ready allies in ihe four
Democratic members of the committee
who were opposed to subsidies of any sort,
and their votes were sufficient to "defeat
the proposition to favorably report the
Scrvmser bill. The opponents of the
Spalding measure were equally stubborn,
and likewise voted witli the Democrats to
refuse to support the other measures. Be
tween the committee factions in the Re
publican ranks tne proposed cable fell
through.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
CHANDLER MAKES
AN EXPLANATION
He Tells of His Connection
With an Incongruous
Resolution.
AN AWKWARD DILEMMA
Why New Hampshire Republi
cans Indorsed Both Reed
and McKinley.
TO KEEP PEACE IN THE FAMILY
The Senator Denounces Political Cow
ardice and Insists on Honest,
Manly Warfare.
CONCORD, N. H., April I.â Senator
Chandler's paper, the Evening Monitor,
publishes a letter to-night which the Sen
ator sent to Senator Lodge last evening.
in it he says:
"The ludicrous incongruity between the
delegates-elect and the last resolution of
the series adopted by to-day's convention
needs an explanation from me. A short
time ago a McKinley movement was or
ganized in Manchester under the lead
of Henry M. Putney of the Mirror news
paper. The pretext for the out
break was my denunciation of the cam
paign methods of Messrs. Osborne and
Hanna, which the Mirror represented as
an assault upon Mr. McKinley personally.
The argument seemed to be because Mr.
Chandler had injudiciously told the truth
about Osborne and Hanna, therefore New
Hampshire ought to abandon Mr. Reed
and support Mr. McKinley. An assumed
virtuous indignation was to change men's
deliberately formed opinions. The move
ment did not seem to threaten anything
serious. Public opinion settled upon eight
persons for delegates known to be favor
able to Mr. Reed.
'â¢Yesterday Mr. Putney came to Concord
as the advance guard of the Manchester
delegates. He had been designated by
the State Committee with two other gen
tlemen as an advisory committee on plat
form. He called on me for ruy views. 1
began by saying that 1 assumed that no
resolution concerning Presidential candi
dates would be proposed, as we had not
done that even during the exciting days
of the Blame canvass. He said that if
resolutions instructing lor Reed were pro
posed tbe Manchester delegates would op
pose them. I replied that no such resolu
tions were desired ; that delegates ought to
be uninstructed and free and uncontrolled
by resolutions of any kind, as they always
had been. I asked him to assent to this
plan.
"Just before starting for the convention
I heard accidentally that the committee
on lesolutions, the night before, had de
cided to add to the platform, wnich had
been shown to me, a resolution declaring
that Mr. Reed was noble and illustrious
and that McKinley was pure and able;
that New Hampshire could be happy with
either and preferred one or the other. I
also learned that it had been arranged to
keep this information from me until as late
a moment as possible.
"I immediately asked the committee to
my room, also such candidates for dele
gates as could be found and a few
other friends, and we consulted hastily.
The candidates said that they had
all been known for week 3as un
reservedly for Reed ; that they were sure of
an election by acclamation ; that a disturb
ance in the convention was undesirable,
and that it was possible, although not
probable, that of the 700 delegates then
pouring into town from the cars, a majority
might be found against us if we bad an
acrimonious debate on an attempt to de
feat a resolution, and that they thought
we had better let the whole platform pass
without a quarrel.
"As I was embarrassed by the fact .that
I was to preside at the convention and bad
no time to arrange the programme
of a fight, I reluctantly yielded to
their opinion and we went to tne
hall. We nominated the delegates by ac
clamation and adopted the platform as a
whole unanimously. A motion was made
by a Boston broker to substitute for the
currency plank the single gold standard
resolution of the Massachusetts conven- ,
tion, which was opposed by Senator Gal
linger and others, and only received one
vote, that of the broker himself. It was
unsuited to the opinion of New Hamp
shire and to the candidacy of Mr. Reed,
who is a bimetallist. The convention
ended before 1 o'clock, joyous and enthu
siastic over the prospect an overwhelming
victory in State and Nation. This expla
nation may not be satisfactory, but it ia all
I can make.
"I confess I was unprepared at the mo
ment of entering the convention for the
device which was the ultimate develop
ment of the Osborne-Hanna movement in
New Hampshire. Our self-restraint -was
cowardly. It was the opinion of good
judges, and it was clear to me after all the
delegates had assembled in the hall and
cheered, first the name of Reed and later
the name of McKinley, that the conven
tion was for Reed two or three to one. I
have acquiesced, in such an act of cow
ardice once before, when we allowed to pass
the resolution of the New Hampshire con
vention in 1877 that the Hayes administra
tion was good and pure rather than have a
bitter controversy over the question
whether its conduct bad been honorable in
surrendering to Democratic usurpers the
lawful Governments of Louisiana and
South Carolina, whose title was as good as
that of Mr. Hayes.
"I once denounced another such act of
cowardice when, on a foolish pretext that
it was necessary to count In Mr. Hayes, it
was agreed by Ohio statesmen to make the
aforesaid surrender of two lawful Southern
governments. Hayes and Packard and
Chamberlain and Republican honor might
all have been saved if the Republicans had
shown the courage of their convictions.
So the mongrel xesoiution of to-day mi;ht
have been easily defeated if men had not
cried peace when honest manly warfare
was required. But the delegates are all
for Reed and I do not think Hanna can
capture any one of them at any stage of
the contest. William E. Chandler."

Republican District Convention held here
to-day delegates were chosen to represent

One of Many Crimes Laid at the Door
of a Man Who Committed
Suicide.
ROCK ISLAND, 111., April I.â Sheriff
Heminway took possession of the farm of
the late Henry F. Bastian in Black Hawk
township, near here, to-day, and a force of
laborers began to dig it up. Bastian com
mitted suicide on March 13, after having
been accused of the murder of his hired
man, Fred Kuschman. whose body was
found on the highway the day before Bas
tain killed himself, but the Coroner's jury
declared Kuschman came to his death in
some unknown manner.
To-day a body identified as that of John
Lauderbach, another hired man of Bas
tian's, wns found buried on the farm and
the latter will be dug up for the purpose of
discovering, '.if r>ossifcfe( ( the bodies of Mar
shall, Lewis an i Franz Kiernzen, who dis
appeared in 1894, while employed by
Bastian.
It developed shortly after Bastain's
deatli that he had forged his mother's
name and succeeded in borrowing $1300 on
a piece of property, the principal of the
loan being due at the present time. Sus
picion also attached to him of having
known something about the burn-ng of a
barn belonging to a neighbor named Mc-
Laughhn. An attempt was made to rob
McLaughlin's house while the barn was
burning, but the identity of the thief was
not disclosed.
NEITHER TO GET
A DEEP HARBOR,
f Continued from First Page.]
the chamber in favor of San Pedro. A
large part of the time was taken up with
discussions of the meaning and intent
of Congressman Hermann's letter to
President Paterson, in which he
pointed with pride to the fact that tbe
Committee on Rivers and Harbors had
been persuaded to recommend an appro
priation for Santa Monica aB well as San
Pedro, and that under this arrangement
Santa Monica would get the larger appro
priation. It was this portion of Her
mann's letter that worried most of the
directors' minds. They did not relish the
idea of seeing the Southern Pacific Com
pany get away with the lion's share of
the spoils after the people here had begun
to consider the prize practically won for
San PedrO.
Some of the directors while professing to
stand firm for San Pedro were nevertheless
of the opinion that it would be unwise to
oppose the proposed appropriation for
Santa Monica, as doing so might defeat
both appropriations. Others argued that
it were better to defeat both, and wait a
year or two than to permit the Govern
ment to become committed to the expendi
ture of a large sum at Santa Monica, which
would surely mean death to the deep-water
project at San Pedro,
Director J. O. Koepfii introduced some
peppery resolutions, drawn up by Colonel
H. C. Otis, who, as chairman of the Free
Harbor League Committee that went to
Washington to lobby- for San Pedro, is
leading the opposition against Santa
Monica. The Otis resolutions were deemed
too sweeping by some of the more con
servatives, and finally the whole question
was disposed of by the adoption of the fol
lowing brief substitute, in which all refer
ence to Santa Monica is left out:
Resolved, That the directors of the Los An
geles Chamber of Commerce hereby declare
their steadfast adherence to San Pedro as the
true and proper siteâ as the people's as well as
the Government'sâ for further harbor improve
ments.

delegation from each of the deputations,
with him being Count Herbert Bismarck
and wife and his son-in-law, Count yon j
Rantzau, and wife, and afterwiird wit- |
nessed from tiie balcony a procession of
the delegations.
Three special trains which reached here
this afternoon brought about 2000 persons
to take part in the torchlight procession j
which was held this evening in honor of |
the ex-Chancellor. The paraders, with
bands playing, marched to the castle and
halted in front of the terrace. At abouc 8
o'clock Prince Bismarck, attired in the
uniform of a cuirassier, over which he
wore a gray cloaK, appeared upon the ter
race and was greeted with enthusiastic
cheers by the thousands who had assem
bled to do him honor. Tne bands played
a thanksgiving hymn, after which Herr
Staelin, a merchant of Hamburg, deliv
ered an address, thanking the Prince for
what he had done for Germany, which,
he declared, would ever be faithfully re
membered.
Prince Bismarck returned thanks in a
brief address, in which he quoted the
words of Martin Luther, that "the good- j
will of one's neighbors is a necessity for a ;
German Christian." He rejoiced, he said, i
that his Hamburg neighbors had preserved j
for him their goodwill and grace, although
he had lost the goodwill of the people in
many places. He was glad, too, that they j
were not ashamed to display their kind â 
feeling for him, and saw in that expres- !
sion an acknowledgment of his former '
deeds. He rejoiced that Hamburg had j
nourished, finding In its progress a proof i
that its hinterland was in a good state, i
No maritime emporium, he declared, i
could prosper without a prosperous hin- I
terland.
The ex-Chancellor dwelt upon the inter
ests of the professional, mercantile and
agrarian classes, whictLhe said were inter
mdependent and all worked in the com
mon cause. If one declined the others
would not prosper. He hoped that Ham
burg would continue to prosper, for the
sake of his own interest as a farmer, even
though he was not a passionate agrarian.
Hearty laughter greeted this remark, and
wben this had subsided Prince Bismarck j
called for cheers for Hamburg, which were
heart'ly given.
The procession then resumed its march,
each division as it passed cheering enthu
siastically for the Prince, who remained
standing, supporting himself by a table.
The ladies, a large number of whom were
present, threw flowers to tbe ex-Chancel
lor and expressed a desire to shake his
hand, but were prevented from doing so
by Dr. Schweninger, his physician. Be
fore retiring from the terrace, Prince Bis
marck, uncovering his head, said- "My
body is unable to stand long fatigues,"
and added, in faltering tones, "My heart
goes out with you."
At this the women sobbed and the men
cheered and shouted "Wiedersehen, Wied*
ersehen," and the cries were continued
until the last of the crowd had taken their
departure.

exertions caused a moisture to collect on
the copper sides of his apartments. :
The calorimeter iis f lined on the ; inside
with copper, next '% to a lining of zinc, and :
the outside is finely matched yellow, pine.
ThÂ« air is sent in through a freezer, which
removes V all . the h moisture. } The % air is
warmed later by an electric light. All ; the
air that is expelled is drawn out of the
cage through pipes, in which are chemi

His Throat.
CHICAGO, 111., April 1. â Hezekiah
Jones, colored, a desperate thief, fleeing
from a crowd of angry citizens, deliber

horriiied pursuers aim expired almost in
their arms shortly after 7 o'clock last
night at the entrance to an alley leading
off from Fifty-first street in Lexington
avenue.
A few moments before he had snatched
a purÂ«e from the hands of Mrs. Lillian
Brown at Rosalie court and Fifty-seventh
street, who was riding in the seat imme
diately behind him on an east-bound Cot
taee Grove avenue gripcar. Her screams
had aroused the passengers and attracted
the attention of wayfarers, and. headed by
Conductor J. A. Joyce, an excited crowd
of men had given chase to th? robber.
Jones leaped from the car when his vic
tim cried out, ana darted toward the
friendly alley opening. A glance, how
ever, snowed him his escape was hopeless,
and taking a razor from his pocket he
coolly faced his pursuers and drew the
keen blade twice across his throat. Reel
ing for an instant he sank to the ground,
and died almost instantly. Jones was 55
years old.
DIAZ ON THE DOCTRINE.
Mexico's President Favors the
Ultimatum of James
Monroe.
Believes It Should Be Defended by
All of the American
Republics.
CITY OP MEXICO, Mkxico, April I.â
Congress was opened to-night. President
Diaz in his message said :
Among the events relative to that great
republic which since my last message have
attracted most attention and roused the
interest of the American nations, there is
one respecting which national motives of
decorum and propriety oblige me to say
some words.
Owing to an ancient dispute over the
boundary between Venezuela and the ter
ritory callad British Guianaâ a dispute
exasperated recently by causes which
need not be considered â the President of
the United States of America sent a mes
sage to the Congress of that country, re*
calling as applicable to said contention
the famous opinion of the doctrine whicu,
in a similar document, President Monroe
expounded, and which since 1823 has had
such acceptance among the people.
Very naturally, recurrence to the doctrine
which condemned every attempt at European
usurpation, and every monarchical tendency
tochunge republican institutions in the new
world, created intense enthusiasm In the free
uutious oi this continent, caubing demon
strations of sympathy from tho people
and even from governments them,
selves of the American countries. The
Mexican Government was not lacking
in invitations of an international
character to at once give its opinion on so
grave a measure, but the executive believed
that it ought not be in a hurry to give its
opinion in a matter which at the time involved
not only the Monroe doctrine, but wan extended
to the application of its principles to the
case of Great Britain in her question
with Venezuela. . Not as fully under
standing this question as it was
perhaps understood iv the United States,
which had received special information from
Venezuela, we were not in a position to pre
sume that the claims of England constituted
an attempt at usurpation. Moreover, wÂ« could
not believe that the very boundary question in
its essence, and even treating oi controversial
points, should be a ea*e lor the application of
that wise doctrine.
On the other hand the simple fact that Eng
land should refuse to submit to arbitration her
rights to one part of the disputed territory,
taking it for granted that she admitted to ar
bitrate for the remainder, could not be in our
judgment sufficient reason for an unfavorable
presumption since the Mexican Government
itselt had decided more thanonce that it would
not admit arbitration for certain territorial
questions which, in our opiniou, involved the
honor of the country. Thus it was that I
declined to make any manifestation through
the press respecting a matter which affected
the interest or thÂ« must delicate sentiments ofr
three nations equally deserving our esteem,
but conliued myseli" to the reply that, nat
urally, I was a partisan of the principles of the
Monroe doctrine, properly understood, but I
could not say whether it was applicable to the
present case or not.
_Nowthat happily and as was to have been
expected the crisis is passed that threatened
war between the two great nations in which
the Anglo-Saxon race is divided; now that our
sister republic of Venezuela is proceeding at
Washington in peaceful negotiations with her
powerful adversary, it does not seem inoppor
tune to accede to the desires of those who re
quested that the Mexican Government should
give its opinion respecting the Mo iroe doc
trine.
Without entering into an examination of the
origin and history of the occasion which gave
rise to its promulgation; without descending
to particulars as to the just limitations which
its author himself would have fixed, and which
with so much prudence President Clevelant
stated, the Government of Mexico cannot do
less than show itself a partisan of the doctrine
which condems us aggressive any invasion
by monarchiftl Europe of the republics of
Americaâ independent nations to-day ruled
by a popular Government. Our history in
general and signally the struggle of our
people to throw off the yoke of an exotic
empire of European origin, form and elements
and the torrents of blood shed in that severe
contest give testimony before the world of our

men who have voted to place legislative
restrictions inÂ»nn Spiritualism. Spiritual
ism cannot get its full growth while it is
hemmed in by the ties of political party
lines. Let us remain true to the divinity

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
LOS ANGELES'
BIG VICTORY
Wins the Suit to Secure a
Permanent Supply
of Water.
BITTER CONTEST ENDED.
Acquires for $25,000 a Tract for
Which the Owners Asked
$1,500,000.
PECULIAR POINT INVOLVED.
Possession of Water-Bearing Strata
Beneath the Surface is
Decided.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April I.â The suit
of the city of Los Angeles against A. E.
Pomeroy and J. D. Hooker, for the con
demnation of water-bearing lands for the
headworks of the city water supply, was
decided to-day by a jury in the Superior
Court, after being on trial for several
weeks. The case is a victory for the city,
and secures for it for $25,000 privileges that
would otherwise have cost it $1,500,000.
The land condemned embraces 313 acres
at the entrance to the San Fernando Val
ley. It is only a small portion of a very
large tract owned by Pomeroy & Hooker,
but it is practically all of the tract that is
underlaid by water-bearing strata. The
contention of the city was that the over
flow was in reality part of the wafers of
the Los Angeles River, which belonged to
the city. The city, therefore, claimed the
light to all the water developed or under
lying the land, and was willing to pay for
the land only, which was worth without
water, at the lowest estimate put on it by
the city, $5000.
Pomeroy <fc Hooker contended that the
subterranean waters were no part of the
river, but belonged to the land and made
it of great value. They estimated the
value of the tract, with the water they
could develop thereon, at $1,500,000, and !
asked for that sum in case the land was
condemned for the city's use. They con
tended that the loss of the water under
this tract would render their adjacent land
almost worthless.
The case was stubbornly fought, eminent
counsel being employed on both sides.
More expert testimony was taken than in
any other case ever tried in the State,
nearly every prominent civil, mining and
hydraulic engineer in Southern California
being examined, as well as many experts
in real estate values. Judge Lucien Shaw's
charge to the jury was elaborate and com
prehensive.
The jury, after deliberating several
hours, returned a verdict awarding the
defendants $23,000 for the property con
demned nnci $2000 damages. Many people
would have considered it a victory for the
city if $50,000 had been awarded the de
fendants. It is probable the case wiil be
appealed. The new acquisition assures
the city a sufficient and permanent water
supply.
COLUSA QUARRY INSPECTED.
Harbor Commissioners Selecting Stone for
the San Francisco Ferry
Depot.
COLTJSA, Cal., April I.â Harbor Com
missioners E. L. Colnon, Daniel P. Cole |
and J. S. Chadbourne arrived from San
Francisco to-day on a tour of inspection to I
tlie Sites sandstone quarry. They were
accompanied by E. R.. Swain, the archi- '
tect; Howard C. Holmes, Chief State En- j
gineer; itichard Gorrel, president of the !
Pacific Bridge Company, the contractors I
for the stone work on the San Francisco !
ferry building; and Assistant Superin- \
tendent of the Southern Pacific T. R.
Jones of Sacramento. The party was met
at Colusa junction by a special train,
under the superintendency ol E. A. Har
rington, having on board several of
Colusa's leading citizens and their wives.
Among the latter were: Colonel John T.
Harrington and wife; J. Grover and wife;
Mrs. E. A. Harrington, Colonel Hager,
Jewell Roggs, Assemblyman William Ash,
J. B. Cooke and others. A collation was
served on the train, of which the party
partook on arriving at the quarry.
The day was a perfect one in the valley,
and every opportunity was civen the party
to thoroughly inspect the stone which lies
there in unlimited quantities. It was the
expressed opinion of all the committee
that no finer building stone could be found
in the country. Tne architect and chief
engineer' were especially pleased with the
character of the stone, and are of the
opinion that it will bear the severest tests,
and that no better could be had <tor the
ferry building.
Alter spending several hours pleasantly
in and around the quarry the party
boarded the train and returned to Colusa,
where they will remain over night, and re
turn to San Francisco to-morrow. They
were all very much pleased with their trip.

SEATTLE, Wash., April I.â Alaska ad
vices received by the steamer Willapa
which arrived in port from the north to
day say that enterprising Sitkans intend
to drain a laKe back of that staid old town
and gather by the wagon-load gold bullion
and dust that for centuries has been
brought down and accumulated in the
bed of the lake by glaciers. The project is
a grand one and commendatory of the
worthy spirits behind it. The outside
world will watch with as much interest
their progress as some Christian folk nave
done for the c^a of the world. The tun
nel will not be an extraordinarily long
one â only about 1000 feet â and it will run
water from the laKe, whose bottom is be
lieved to be paved with gold to a great
depth. The feeders for the lake are be
lieved to have been ancient glaciers which,
in their slow process of travel, have ground
up the mountains into debris and depos
ited precious metal along with sediment
in the lake bottom. Claims have already
been taken up and preparations for un
locking the secrets of glacier and lake are
to be pushed forward.
Another bit of sensational news from
Alaska is that the great ice-bound region
is being made aware of Professor Andrie's
proposed aerial trip to the North Pole, and
that the natives from Point Barrow to
Greenland, are looking forward with keen
interest to his appearance. The Pacific
Geographical Society has in hand the dis
semminating of the news, and letters have
been sent out by the commercial compa
nies doing business in Arctic Alaska, with
the request that the information be im
parted to all accessible natives, in order
that they may render assistance when
Professor Andrie and his balloon comes
their way.
Andrie, according to this society, which
claims to have been so notified by the
Minister from Norway and Sweden at
Washington City, will start from Spitz
bergen some time in July. This news will
be spread broadcast at Wrangel Land, off
the coast of Siberia, among the Tehutchis
tribe, which wbb so liberally rewarded
some years ago by this Government for as
sistance to American shipwrecked sailors,
by the steam whaler Orca, Captain Mc-
Gregor. The Orca, which is now en route,
will also go far east in the Arctic.
There is no abatement in the rush to
Alaska; on the contrary, the exodus is on
the increase, and by Saturday no less than
fifteen vessels, big and. little, with a pas
senger list of fully 1000 men and freight
and supplies in proportion will have sailed
from this port for the golden field to the
north.
The Indian mail-carrier, "Jimmy" Jack
son, who left Seattle early in the winter
with mail for the Yukon, has, it is re
ported by Robert Insle3 ? , who has just
made his way out of that country, proba
bly met the fate of the two newspaper
men â Hodge and McNelis â whom he de
serted and left to perish. When last seen
he v/as off the trail, and cold and hunger
had apparently unbalanced his mind. His
two Indian companions he had also left
behind, and he had thrown away much
mail matter.

BRUCE GOVERNS ARIZONA.

to the Secretary of the
Territory.
Appointees of the Late Executive
Likely to Be Ousted by
Franklin.
PHOENIX, Ariz., April I.â Secretary
C. M. Bruce is acting Governor of Arizona
to-night. A telegram from J. M. Reynolds,
acting Secretary of the Interior, to Gov
ernor Huirhes, came this evening, direct
ing him to vacate the office and turn it
over to Secretary Bruce.
This Hughes did at 4:30 o'clock, stating
that he would consider himself Governor
until official notification of his removal
came from the President, who had com
missioned him ; but to avoid an unseemly
wrangie he would turn the office over to
Secretary Bruce. His friends prevailed
upon him to abandon his determination
to tight his removal before the Senate.
It is not believed that Governor Bruce
will make any radical changes amon><
office-holders, as his tenure of office will
only last until Governor Franklin is con-
Jinned by the Senate. When Governor
Franklin is installed a prettir fight is an
ticipated, as it is expected that he will
make a clean sweep ol Hughes' appointees,
and leading officers here say the Governor
has no right to remove an officer except
for cause.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April I.â lhe
Interior Department authorities, upon re
ceipt of a telegram from Territorial Secre
tary Bruce of Arizona that Governor
Hughes refused to vacate his office, to-day

STOCKTON MAN'S
FIGHT FOR LIFE
Andrea Vacaressa's . Futile j
Struggle Against an .
Assassin.
SLAIN IN HIS DWELLING
The Victim's Wife Under Arrest
. for Complicity in the
Killing.'
MURDER FOLLOWS A QUARREL.
Intimate Friend of the Woman Believed
to Have Assisted in the
Homicide.
STOCKTON, Cai,. April 1. â Andrea
Vacaressa, a bootblack who formerly kept
a stand in front of Eshbach's saloon, was
murdered last night. His wife is now in
jail on suspicion of having been implicated
in the homicide. The officers are confi
dent that Vacaressa was killed by her or by
her paramour and are now looking for the
latter. â¢
: Shortly after 1 o'clock this morning,
Mrs Vacaressa tushed from her house,
which is located on Washington street
two blocks east of East street, and ran to
the house of Manuel Silva. She awakened
Silva and told him that burglars had en
tered their home and were trying to kill
her husband. Silva did not feel like ven
turing alone into the place, so he sought
the aid of a neighbor, Antonio Kovetta.
With this neighbor and Mrs. Vacaressa he
went to the latter's home, but all three
were afraid to enter without further as
sistance. They. went to Constable Howe's
place, not far away, and aroused him.
Howe hurriedly dressed, but by this time
nearly a half hour had elapsed.
When the "Constable reached the place
he found the front door open and Vaca
ressa's body lying in the doorway. About I
. the man's neck was a small clothesline !
drawn tightly arid, tied to the knob of the
door. Blood was gushing from his nose,
mouth and ears, and he had been dead but
a few minutes.
There was every Indication that there
had been a desperate struggle, and the
house was in a state of disorder. The
drawers of the bureau had been aaken out j
and the contents strewn about. Several |
trunks had been ransacked, as though the j
work had been done by burglars. There i
â was no great amount of money in. the j
house, and Vacaressa possessed no valua
bles that would iempt thieves. ' ' â 
Howe ' notified the Sheriff office, and |
several deputies- hastened to the scene of i
the murder. Investigation led to the be- !
lief that death had not resulted from stran
gulation, but that the dead man had been
struck over the head with, some blunt in
strument and killed, that way. The rone
was not drawn tightly enough about the
neck to cause death, and the opinion of the
officers was that it was merely put there
to mislead them. There was blood on the
foot of the bed and blotches of blood on
the floor in the two rooms, indicating that
Vacaressa had been killed in the bedroom
" and the body dragged to the front door.
. The Sheriff's deputies soon learned that
the bootblack had a violent quarrel with
his wife earlier in the night and that they
were fighting, when a young man named
Hall, who lives in the neighborhood,
passed by the house. So violent' was the
quarrel that a pane of glass was broken.
It was also learned from Italians who j
knew the couple well. that the wife was !
enamored of another Italian, and that this
was the cause of much trouble between
her and her husband. '}â '..;'.
According to the story told the officers
by Mrs. Vacaressa, her . husband came
home intoxicated and went to .bed with
bis clothes on. This led to a quarrel be
tween them, but she claimed that their
troubles had ended and that he. was lying
on the bed when the burglars entered.
She at once/flew out of the house and
sought assistance. The officers doubted
her story and concluded to take her to
jail. Investigation to-day confirms the be
lief that the woman knows who killed her
husband: "*MjWÃjWtjjjl^Â«<ffi
. District Attorney Nutter interviewed
Mrs. Vacaressa at the jail through an in
terpreter and had, her answers taken down
by a stenographer.
â  "I do not know, what time it was," said
the woman, "but it must have been after
1 o'clock, when a man came into the room
where I was lying in bed. He was tall
and wore a mask. He asked me for money,
" placing his fingers on my throat. I told
him I did not have any, except $2 or $3
which I had in .my dress lying near the
bed. I gave him, and then he de
manded more. I then told him that per
haps my husband had more money, but
that I had not. . My husband woke up
while we were talking and the man went
around the bed to where he was. - He then
attacked my husband and I ran out of the
room, taking the. children with me and
their clothes and mine. I put my dress
on outside of the house and went over to
Mr. Silva's place.. â¢ There 1 asked for
shelter and told what had happened."
â¢ â¢â¢Did the man speak to you in English
or Italian?" was asked.
- "He spoke in English," â  replied Mrs.
Vacaressa. "There was only one burglar,
Be had on dark " : clothes, but I could not
tell anything else as to how he looked, for
I was so frightened. I. ran out of the house
;, as soon as he attacked my husband."
"Did the man have anything in his
hand?" asked the District Attorney. .
"Yes; he had .something that looked
like a round ball; in one hand, but I do
not know what it was. They were strug
gling when I left the house."
Mrs. Yacaressa said that she did not
scream or make any outcry to alarm the
neighbors after leaving the house, as she
was afraid the man would follow her ana
harm the children or herself. '
The investigation made by the District
Attorney and the deputy sheriffs this morn
ing early si. owed that the rope that was
tied about the murdered man's neck had
been cut from a clothesline in the back
yard,, the cut being a fresh one. The ,
watchdog that -is. usually tied in the yard
was missing, and- his collar was hanging
from the chain, where it had been cut
from him. The woman claimed to know
nothing- about the dog's disappearance,
but admitted he had been let loose by some
one earlier in the day and tied up again
toward night. - â  'â¢-Â».'
The â  lioi.t ;â¢ door, near which the -. mur
. : â  â â -.:'
dered Vacaressa was found, had been
pried open with a chisel. The officers are
inclined to the belief that this was done as
a blind, as the woman was not asleep at
the time and claims to have heard no
noise until the man stood beside her by
the bed and spoKe to her.
The inquest to-night developed the fact
thai the murder must have been com
mitted by Mrs. Vacaressa herself, but the
Coroner's jury rendered a verdict of death
by strangulation at the hands of some
person or persons unknown. The District
Attorney will probably enter a formal
charge of murder against the woman to
morrow.
Combine of- linkers.
STOCKTON, Cal., April I.â The princi
pal baker? of this city have combined and
the result of their combine went into effect
to-day. They have been contemplating
the move for some time, but it was not un
til last night that the matter was trot into
definite shape. The bakers say that the
Combine is not for the purpose of getting a
"curner"' on bread, but simply to decide
upon a uniform price. Their action is di
rected at the restaurants and hotels partic
ularly and the restaurateurs and the
hotel men are wroth and threaten to refuse
to buy bread from any in the combine.
It has been the custom here for some
time for the suppliers of bread to the pub
lic eating-places to also furnish a boarder
or two to the "hotel or restaurant patroniz
ing them. Sometimes an employe of the
bakery would board at the hotel or res
taurant and he would get special rates,
while the bakery would be charged thu
regular price for his fare. Thus at the end
of each month the baker's bill would be
in part offset by the account of the res
taurant or hotei man. The bakers decided
to do away with that, so they fixed a
wholesale rate for bread to be furnished to
the restaurants and hotels for cash. A fine
of $100 was agreed upon as a penalty for
each violation of the compact.
Brewery for Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cal., April I.â Samuel
Henery, formerly Chief of Police of this
city, has returned from San Diego and
brings the news that Stockton has a good
chance to secure another big industry. A
number of Minneapolis men, he says, are
anxious to start a brewery in this "State,
and they are said to have expressed a
preference for Stockton. They will locate
the plant here, provided they can secure a
suitable site. A $75,000 brewery is now
being built in San Diego by Minneapolis
men, and one of the members of the com
pany told Mr. Henery that another com
pany would soon be organized in that city,
and would establish a brewing business in
this State and Stockton stood an excellent
chance of securing the plant. Mr. Hen-ary
will bring the matter to the attention of
the Commercial Association.
Woodbridye Canal Claims.
STOCKTON, Cal., April I.â An effort is
being made by the creditors of the Wood
bridge Canal Company to organize for the
purpose of bidding in the property of the
company to satisfy their claims. The
movement is headed by J. C. Thompson,
a capitalist of this city, and a number of
the other large creditors are also interested
in the movement. At present the system
is not paying, and is in the hands ot' E. C.
Chapman as receiver. Ever since its start
the concern has gone behind, and the men
who built the caual have not received the
money for their work. Altogether, ac
cording to Mr. Thompson, the company
owes something like $150,000.
Would Forgive His Wife.
STOCKTON-, Cal., April 1. â Hawky
Nelson, whose wife eloped from Temple
ton with Charles Paulson and was arrested
with the latter here yesterday, arrived
here to-night. He says that if his wife
will return home to her children he will
forgive her, but if not be will prosecute
her and Paulson. A constable will be heie
to-morrow night with warrants for their
arrest.
GUESTS OF SANTA
The Vanderbilt-Depew Party Shown the
Sights of the Pretty Town by
the Sea.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April I.â The Van
dorbilt-Depew party was entertained by
John R. Chace of the Sea Beach Hotel here
this afternoon. Upon the arrival of the
special train Mr. Chace, through Division
Superintendent Frasier of the Southern
Pacific, presented Mayor Effev, Liutenant-
Governor Jeter, Judge Logan of the Supe
rior Court and Richard Thompson of the
"\Vells-Fargo Express Company, and the
visitors, including their guests â George
R. Fearinc of Newport, John Hone of New
Jersey and C. F. Crocker of San Francisco,
were "taken by Mr. Chace for a drive over
the clifi road, returning to the Sea Beach
Hotel. They vis. ted several points of in
terest, passing Lighthouse point and
stopping at the residence of Judge
Logan, situated on an elevation
of. nearly 300 feet, from which
they gained a fine view of the surrounding
country and the Bea. Mr. Depew de
clared "this the grandest natural promi
nence that he bad seen in California, and
said the half hour spent there among the
flowers and trees would furnish the locals
for several after-dinner stories that would
be no discredit to California. Mr. Van
derbilt was far more free and expressive
than he is accredited with beine.
When they returned, the Santa Cruz
gentlemen spent a pleasant quarter ot an
hour in the cars, which, Mr. Vanderbilt
said, would have carried them 8000 miles
when they returned to New York.
"And out of twenty-two nights," he
added, speaking with some diffidence,
"we have spent eighteen in the cars. We
have every accommodation, every con
venienceâand he Jooked with a show of
pride at the magnificent caparisoningâ all
that one could ask traveling about the
country behind a locomotive."
"Except a telephone," remarked Mr.
Dejiew, dryly, without looking up from a
telegram he was writing.
"But we can tap the wires," rejoined
Mr, Vanderbilt, -with a si ight blush.
UKIAH SPORTSMEN ACT
Fish Commissioner Hollingsworth
Accused of Violating the
Game Laws.
Warrant for His Arrest Is Sworn Out
and He Will Be Vigorously
Prosecuted.
UKIAH, Cal., April I.â A warrant was
sworn out this afternoon charging J. D.
Hollingsworth, resident Fish Commis-:
sioner, with a misdemeanor in having
caught trout during the closed season. On
Monday evening a meeting of the Sports
men's Club wa.s held, at which a letter was
read charging Hollingsworth with having
committed this offense. The Commis
sioner was surprised at the accusation, but
finally acknowledged having been fishing
during February.
Hollingsworth had been particularly
active in the pursuit of illegal deer-hunters
and illicit trout-fishers, and only last week
had arrested a man from San Francisco
and succeeded in having him fined for |
trout-catching. The culprit was made to
pay $50, and Hoilincswood had gone to
the meeting of the Sportsmen's Club in
the expectation of receiving ttie informer's
portion of the reward, when the surprise
was sprung on him. The warrant was
sworn to by J. C. Ruddock, on behalf of
the club, and the offender will be severely
punished, it is said, in cuse he is con
victed.

SAXTA ROSA'S RIVALS.
Mrs. Burris Again. Wrests the Lead
From Miss Hnll.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April I.â The re
sult of the voting for a carnival Queen to
day shows that there will be only two
belles in the race, out of the forty starters.
They are Mrs. L. W. Burris and Miss Sara
Hall. The bulk of the votes cast to-day
were for these two, as it has been thought
for several days that the honor would Tall
to one of them.
The large vote to-day resulted in placing
Mrs. Burris once more in the lead, by
something over a hundred votes. The
lead has alternated between Mrs. Burris
and Miss Hall for more than a week, re
sulting in a friendly rivalry that has en
rolled the whole town on one or the other
side. Either of the candidates would fill
the queenly office with a grace and dig
nity that would reflect credit upon the fes
tival. The voting will close on the even
ing of April 11.
SOLANO COUNTY PRESERVES.
Cordelia Shooting Club Will Make Another
Effort to Monopolize Hunting
Privileges.
BUISUN, Cal., April I.â A motion will
be made in the Superior Court of Solano
County to obtain a new trial in the case of
C. W. Kelloug, trustee of the Cordelia
Shooting Club, vs. William King et al.
An action was brought by this club last
November to restrain the defendants from
hunting on the Chamberlain tract, on the
ground that irreparable injury was done to
the hunting privileges of the m-mbers.
The case occupied the attention of
the court for some time, and much interest
was taken iii the proceedings. The de
fendants maintained that the club had no
legal existence and had a license only for
forty members to shoot over the grounds
in question.
The decipion of Judge Buckles Was
lengthy and covered every point advanced
by the respective counsel. The Judge was
opposed to the establishment of preserves
on the Suisun marshes, which he stated
savored strongly of English landlordism.
He denied the injunction asked for and
gave judgment for the defendants. Judge
Buckles maintained that the lease gave the
members of the Corrieiia Club a license,
for only forty members to shoot over the
ground, and they had no right to prevent
other people from going on the marshes to
hunt it they did not molest the lights of
others.
If the motion for a new trial is refused
an appeal will be made in the Supreme
Court.
PORTZAAD DAMAGE SVIT.
Cath Demanded for the Alienating of a
Hife'a Affi-rtiotiK.
PORTLAND. Or., April I.â Twenty-five
thousand dollars is the sum that Fred
Mossman demands from Captain Charles
Hill of the steamer Governor Newell, a
truding boat. Mossman claims that Cap
tain Hill alienated his wife's affections.
Hill is Mossman's brother-in-law and the
plaintiff was formerly employed by the de
lenJant on the boa. The case is "on trial
in the Circuit Court here.
D. L. Purcell, the mother of Mrs. Moss
man, testified that Mossman bore a good
reputation. He described a visit of his
son-in-law made to his house shortly after
he was informed by his wife that she had
been wronged by Hill against her will.
Mossman was greatly agitated. To Purcell
the man seemed to be in a desperate frame
of mind.
This afternoon, during the introduction
of testimony, the plaintiff offered the
deposition of""Captain" Minnie Hall, wile
of the defendant, who is now in Fran
cisco. Mrs. Hill states her knowledge of
*he occurrences set up as a basis for the
complaint for damages.
Captain Hill and his lawyers claim the
suit is an attempt to blackmail him, and
they will show in defense that it is partly
the result of a family row.
SANTA ROSA'S ELECT/ON.
Democrats Believed to Have Seated Their
Mayoralty Candidate After a Lively
Campaign.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April I.â The live
liest city election for many years was held
here to-day. Nearly 1400 votes were cast,
being the most in the history of the city.
Tnere were three regular tickets in the
fieldâ Democratic, ReDublican and Popu
j listâ with independent candidates for
many offices. The offices of mayor, mar
shal, clerk, treasurer, city attorney, re- :
corder, assessor and street" commissioner
( were to be filled, and three councilmen
1 and five library trustees chosen.
The main fight was over the mayoralty
and the offices of Street Commissioner and
City Marshal. Over 450 votes were polled
in Precinct 2, which makes it impossible
to finish the count before morning.
From present indications the offices will
be evenly divided between the two old
, parties and the following gentlemen will
undoubtedly be selected:
Mayor, Dr. J. W. Jesse (D.); Marshal,
W. J. Steadman (R.); Clerk, C. W. Mob
ley (D.); Attorney, O. O. Webber (R.);
! Street Commissioner, John McMinn Sr.
; (D.); Assessor, EL L. Johnson (R.); Re
i corder, W. K. McCorkle (D.).
For Councilmen it is believed the Demo
crats will elect M. J. Bower and J. M. Car
ter, and W. B. Simpson, the Republican
\ candidate, will be the third. For library
â  trustees the result is still in doubt.
The official returns will not be given out
until a late ftbur in the morning, but un
less unlooked-for changes occur at the last
moment, the complete ticket will be aÂ«
1 stated.
STANFORD GIRLS TRAINING
Captain McCray of the Basket-
Bali Team Regrets Lack
of Enthusiasm.
Fair Athletes Demand a Grant
Varsity Sweaters â Condition of
the Trackmen.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
April 1. â The basket-ball girl* are meeting
with some of the discouragements which
overtake the other branches of athletics
here. First, there is the trouble of secur
ing Varsity sweaters for the members of
the team, and â worse still â the team
doesn't turn out enough players to permit
of a real game. Last evening there were
but eight Stanford girls on hand to meet !
the Castilleja team; but they managed to
win the game by a score of 4to 1. Captain
McCray can't understand why her players
do not enter with the required amount of
enthusiasm into the practice, when the
match with the Berkeley girls is to come
off so soon. Were it not for the Castilleja
girls, who volunteered to practice with
the Stanford team, the latter would be in
poor condition for actual work with its j
Berkeley rivals.
The trackmen are to have a training
table from now until the field day with
Berkeley. Most of the athletes are getting
back to work after the vacation. . The
track is in very poor condition, but will!'
probably be remedied before long. Most
of the runners are in fair condition now ;
and will merely have to maintain their
present state.
The glee ana mandolin chibs returned
from their southern tour last evening fa
tigued, but with pleasant recollections of
their trip. Treasurer Hinsdill, who ac
companied the clubs, states that they
came out loser to the extent of $200 or $30U,
but plans were under way for making up i
this deficit. Before the executive commit
tee permitted the clubs to make this trip
It required v cuarantee of $400, which was
given. In this manner the student body '
was protected against any loss. The gen- j
eral feeling here is that the clubs did ex
ceedingly well, considering that it was !
their first tour.
To-morrow atternoon Chauncey M. De
pew is to address the students in the f
chapel and everybody is planning to hear
the brilliant New Yorker.
Portland Druggists Fail.
PORTLAND, Or., April L â United
States District Judge Bellinger to-day in
chambers appointed F. K. Arnold re
ceiver for the wholesale drug firm of Snell,
Heitshu & Woodward, with bonds fixed at
$5000. This action was precipitated by
Munvon's Homeopathic Home Remedy
Company of Philadelphia, which las r t
week entered suit in attachment against
the drughouse for $2450 58. Tue London
and San Franrisco Bank is the heaviest
cieditor, and a trust deed covering the
drug firm's property, amounting to $60,
--000, was filed to-day conveying the prop
erty to the bank.

yards away irom the house shot himself
through the brain, dying instantly.
SAN BERNARDINO'S
VOLCANIC CAVE
Discovery of the Probable Source
of the Arrowhead Hot
Springs.
FLAMES FROM A DEEP CAVERN.
Lake of Lava Uncovered by the Blast
of a Heavy Charge of
Dynamite.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., April I.â
A wonderful and interesting discovery has
been made near Arrowhead Sprincs by
Thomas Hatten, a pioneer resident of San
Bernardino, and tbe owner of a big ranch
near the foothills. He ha 3 found the proba
ble source of the warm water in and about
Arrowhead Springs.
Hatten on Tuesday started in quest of
sheep that were missing. Following an
old trail over Waterman Canyon, he came
upon p natural basin formed by rocks.
While gazing about the littievalley he saw
at a distance of about 350 yards a thin
white column of smoke issuing from be
hind a boulder. Believing it was a camp
fire, he went toward it to ascertain if the
campers hads-een his sheep. When Hatten
reached the rock he found no sign of life
and the smoke had disappeared.
Hatten determined to investigate. The
big bowider was in the way, and he went
to a quarry some distance away and pro
cured dynamite. One of the quarrymen,
named Burke, accompanied him back.
They put a big charge or dynamite under
the rock, and it was blown to atoms.
From the spot where the bowlder stood
issued a sheet of flames, throwing out in
tense heat. After the flames subsided the
men approached the spot and discovered a
cave of some depth, at the bottom of which
there appeared to be flowing lava. It will
probably be some time before the cavern
can be fully explored, owing to the intense
beat issuing from its mouth.
In various parts of the mountains in the
vicinity of this discovery are lava forma
tions. Scientists have been trying for
some time to fathom the origin of the
many warm springs in and about Arrow
head, but the honor of the discovery has
fallen to Hatten.
BUNKER HILL'S HOT SPRING.
Boiling Water With Medicinal Properties
From the Pipes of an Artesian
We/1.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., April I.â
An artesian well of hot water has been
struck at Bunker Hill, jnst south of this
city, on the Southern California motor
road.
When work was commenced on the well
the persons boring it had no idea of what
was in store for them. For nearly three
months past a steam well-borer has been
sinking a 7-inch pipe. After boring down

less difficulty was encountered until two
weeks ago, when the big pipe was lost and
broken. â¢
After several attempts to pull up the
pipe it was decided to run down a smaller
one. A five-inch pipe was placed inside of
the larger one and the work renewed.
When the iron tube was down 500 feet the
workmen met a peculiar obstruction in the
shape of an outburst of sand, steam and
hot water.
In a short time the lowlands were cov
ered with boiling water. The water rises
in a stream five inches in diameter to a
heig tof several inches above the mouth
of the pipe, and retains a temperature of
I<lÃ degrees. It is strongly impregnated
with sulphur and other chemical proper
ties, which fill the air with an unpleasant
odor.
Civil engineers in this city are of the
opinion that the water comes from the
same strata that furnishes the lamoiis
Arrowhead Hoi springs, to the nortli of
San Bernardino. Hundreds of people have
visited the w 11, and one person who
claims to be suffering from acute rheuma
tism says tluu he bat ed his arms in the
wuters and feit immediate relief.
BRIDGING THE MERCED
Satisfactory Progress Made by
the San Joaquin Valley
Road Constructors.
Grant Brothers Will Soon Move Their
Camp to the Chowchilla
River.
FRESNO, Cal., April I.â Assistant En
gineer Edes of the Valley Railroad was in
Fresno to-day. He reports very satisfac
tory progress in the work of construction
all along the line. The bridge now build
ing over the Tuolumne River will soon De
completed and the piling for the Merced
River bridge is nearly done. It is ex
pected that the bridge being built across
the Merced River will be completed son.c
time about the last of this month. The
work of laying the track between the
bridge and the town of Merced will require
but a few days time. Grant Brothers,
who have done most of the grading, will
do the grading through Madera County,
it is expected that they will move their
camp to the Chowchilla River within the
next ten days.
Work will be commenced on the San
Joaquin River bridge some time during
the latter part of April. The plans have
been completed and accepted, but ina
bility to secure the required timber for the
superstructure has necessarily delayed the
commencement of the work.
The committee of ten here has about
concluded its labors in securing rights-of
way through Fresno County. There are I
few small strips which have not yet been
purchased owine to the iailure of owners
to agree upon terms. As a rinal resort
these pieces of property will be made sub
ject to condemnation suits, which will be
instituted by the company in a few days.

WITH MAMMA TO THE GRAVE
The Victims of the Recent Domestic
Tragedy Are Viewed by Thou
sands of People.
Dressed in. their everyday clothes, such
as they have been wearing at the kinder
garten, the three linle babies of Mrs. Olga.
l>euss lay, exposed to the public craze,
yesterday ana last evening in the Suhr
undertaking parlors on Mission street.
Gretchen, tbe eldest of the eirls, whose
eighth birthday and !u-r burial are to be
on the Â«ame day, was placed to her dead
mother's immediate ritrht, while little
Fredda and Carl, the still younger child,
were comfortably held on a narrow couch,
which would have been too small for v
grown person.
The Dack room of the undertaking estab-

li.-hment in which were laid the four vic
tims of the recent sad tragedy was turned
into a bower of plants ami flowers, and,
but for the hard lines of the mother's face
and her dark clothing, very little stretch
of imagination would have been necessary
to regard the babies as in life bur simulat
ing sleep. Their short ginsrnam dresses
reaching as low as the knees disclosed
plump little legs in black stockings and
ie<-t correctly encased in buttoned gaiters.
It was all -o different from the usual in
such cases. There was nothing aside from
the^ profusion of flowers that suggested
Vain. Tiie children looked as if they
were simply sleepingâ posing, in fact, to
look their prettiest.
But there was no mistaking the
nature of the occasion. The &tory of
the dreadful tragedy which, in a night,
deprived â¢ Ji. O. Deuss of his
loving wife and prattling babies
has become widely known. Mothers,
fathers, brothers and sisters throughout
this City who read of the triple murder
end suicide, and whose feelings were
touched even to tears, sought out the
temporary haven where the mother and
children were sheltered. They went there
to mingle their tears with those of a
heart-broken husband and fataer, and
Beltisbly seek in another's sorrow a grati
fication for the insignificance of their own.
Thorsands of men, women and children
â  l the bodies. A continual stream of
.: humanity poured in during theday
and night, elbowing and quarreling for
points of vantage and passing out on the
crow ded sidewalk to discuss with strangers
all the minute details of the tragedy.
Mr. Buhr found it absolutely imperative
to prol.ilii: some <5f the old crones from
going into the mortuary apartments, and
others he quietly showed to the door.
The funeral wili.- iake place this after
noon. Mrs. Deuss will be conveyed to the I
Odd Fellows 1 Cemetery in a hearse by her- !
self. Following will be the three little
children in their tiny white coffins all in j
one hearse.
The bodies will be placed in the public
vault awaiting the arrival ol Mrs. Deuss'
ter and sisters from Chicago and
Washington on Saturday next, when ar
rangements will be made to have them cre
mated, according to the last wish of the
mother.
As the debased lady belonged to no
church in particular Emil Liess of the Ger
man paper, Tageblatt, â  free-thinker, will
deliver the funeral oration. Eight little
boyi from the Mission Turn Verein and a
like number of men will act as pall
bearers.
SANG FOR THE PAINTERS
A Number of Performers Aided
the Strikers' Entertain
ment.
The President Was Presented With a
Rose Palette and a White
Badge.
A thoroutrhlv successful entertainment
was at the Bush-street Theater last
nignt for the benelit of the striking paint
ers. The house- had been almost sold out
before the opening of the doors, and
though all the seat-holders were not pres
ent there was a large audience, which
joined in the choruses of a number of the
songs and cheered the performers on their
way with plenty of applause.
One of the most interesting features of
the entertainment was a presentation to
the president of the Painters' and Decora
tors' Union, J. W. Rose. This gentleman,
who was blandly unconscious of the honors
in store for him, had been decoyed into a
box close to the stage and persuaded to
remain there against his will till about
the midale of the performance, when he
was mysteriously requested to step on
the stage.
Fiskey Barnett, the stage manager, was
already waiting for Mr. Rose before the
footlights. As soon as that gentleman ap
peared he said, ''The first thing I will do
is to place this emblem on your breast,
and you well deserve it,' 1 and with these
I words Mr. Barnett {tinned a white badge
attached to a gilt star on the president's
coat. "There it is. Rose," added the stage
I manager, and he presented Mr. Rose with
j a large palette, composed of white roses,
| on which the word "Rose" was written in
! reÂ»i rlowers.
j|Tlie president took the gift anirt great
! applause, and was about to retire when he
', was vociferously requested to make a
j speech. "I did not come here to make a
I speech, ladies and jientlenien," he replied.
''This is as much of a surprise to me as it
is to any one here," and then the presi
dent of the Painters' Union went on to
speak of the strike. "It is not alone the
; right of the painters," he said. "We feel
! that it is also a ticht for every man in the
: country who earns his living honestly by
work."
The entertainment was a long and varied
one and there were enough encores to
j more than treble the bill. The Swedish
| Singing ; Society, consisting of eighteen
1 male voices, opened the performance by
j singing Abt's "Morning Song'" in excel
lent style. Mr. yon Orr won much ap
piause for a violin solo and Gilbert and
j Goldie's specialties might possibly have
been going on still if the comedians had
; responded to all the encores that were de
| manded. Mme. Ellen Coursen Roeckel sang
"The Eagle and the Bear" in a spirited
manner, and Billie Morris, with cork
j blacked face, male jokes which caused the
; house to resound with laughter.
Miss Monterey sang several ditties in
j the choruses of some of which the audi
i ence joined; Bree gave some good banjo
; selections and a spirited song composed
j especially for the Painters' Union; Ida
Clayton's songs were joined in by the au
dience, the songs and dances of the Burtis
sisters were warmly applauded. Spick
ett's Irish specialties were amusing, Miss
Brightling and Ja petite Rosa performed
cleverly on the banjo, Silver and Wyatt
gave some good songs and dances, Joseph
ine Qaasmsn warbled some of her favorite
"itties and A. J. Holten and Miss Kittle
Bi'lyer appeared in specialties.
W. Danielsen was chairman of the enter
tainment committee. Its other members
were: W. .1. Moloney, Robert Barbee, Al
Feline and L. Tavlo'r.
Forget the Violets.
Among other characteristics of Walter
Savage Candor, the famous author, werd
Ins absent-mindedness and his passionate
love for animals and the vegetable world.
On one occasion, having suffered not long
before from leaving the key of his port
manteau behind him, he took special pre
cautions before starting on a journey to
see that his keys were in his Docket. When,
however, he produced them in triumph at
his journey's end, he found that he had
left the portmanteau behind! Landor,
though he often handled his fellow-men
somewhat roughly, hated to see an old
me felled, and even shrank from plucking
a rose. One morning he collared his man
cook and Hung him out of the window.
Then, ( suddenly remembering on what
"bed" in the garden the man would fall,
the flower-loving Landor exclaimed, "Good
heavens! I forgot the poor violets!"

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
IS HE THE STRANGLER?
Julius Festner of Omaha in a
Padded Cell in the Hos
pital.
HE INSULTS A YOUNG LADY.
His Description Tallies With That
Given by Irene Phillips and
Laura Petit.
A man who answers in every particular
the one who attempted to strangle Irene
Phillips at 304 Sutter street and Laura
Petit at 212 Ellis street, within the past
few days, is now in a padded cell in the
Receiving Hospital.
Last night between 10 and 11 o'clock a
young lady named Miss Fennell was walk
ing along Pine street, near Leavenworth,
on her way home, when a man accosted
her, making an insulting proposal. She
quickened her pace and he followed her;
then she broke into a run till she reached
her own house on Pine street, near Hyde.
She quickly opened the front door with
j the latch-key, and as she hastily shut the
! door the man was in front of it.
He tried to break open the door and the
noice attracted the attention of Policeman
John McLaughlin, who ran up and arrested
him. The man fought desperately and
, McLaughlin had a terrible struggle with
! him before he overpowered him and got
j the handcuffs on him.
The young lady told McLaughlin what.
I the man had done, and as he appeared to
be insane McLaughlin had him taken in
i the patrol wagon from the California
street station to the hospital, where he
was placed in a padded cell. It took five
men to pet him out of the wagon and into
the cell.
From papers and newspaper clippings
found in iris pocket he is Julius Festner,
son of G. C. Lestner, a prominent printer
of Omaha, Neb., and part proprietor of a
German newspaper there. He is a mar
ried man and was divorced from his wife
in 188H for attempting to choke her while
in a crazy mood, but they were remarried
in l^*y. She lives at 1355 South Seven
teenth street, Omaha. He is a n'usician
and took part in amateur entertainments.
A postal card in his pocket from a
friend in San Miguel was addressed to the
Golden West Hotel. Inquiry there elicited
the information that Festner registered
there from Omaha on March 22, but as he
conducted himself in a crazy manner he
LÂ»ot his quietus on Monday last. It is not
known where he has been'living since.
Festner is a man about .HO years of age,
5 feet 9 inches tall, blonde mustache
curled at the ends, large blue eyes, light
long hair and dressed in a dark suit, light
overcoat and soft gray felt hat. This de
scription tallies exactly with that given
to the police by the Phillips and Petit
women.
These women will be asked by the police
to-day to have a look at him at the hos
pital to see if they can identify him.
Pie could not have been the man who
strangled Mamie McDermott and Bertha
Farad in, as he was apparently not in the
City then, but it is just possible he may
have told the Golden West people that he
had just arrived from Omaha when he
registered on March 22. but had been liv
ing somewhere else in the City before that
date.

train struck a broken rail on a heavy
curve. The engine and front car passed
over in safety, but the two rear car 9 rolled
down a high embankment, and then
caught fire and were burned.
One man, a passeneer named McKelvy
of Butler, was so badly hurt that he will
probably die.

THEATER MANAGER ROBBED.
A Dinner That Cost Him $5000 in
Money and Jewelry.
NEW YORK, N. V ., April The
Tribune this morning says: William Har

went to Boston on a ; visit : last week and
was robbed of $5000. His home is in Bos

INVOLUNTARY CONVERTS
Thousands of Christians Forced
to Embrace Mohammedan
ism or Death.
Moslem Fanaticism at Its Height in
Turkey, and a Reign of Terror
Exists.
BOSTON, Mass., April I.â Letters re
ceived in Boston from Turkey show that
the Moslem crusade continues. One cor
respondent says that there have been thou
sands of forced conversions, so called.
The central government and the local
government say that such conversions are
not genuine and cannot be accepted. The
pressure has been growing lighter, al
though where there is a mixed population
there is no Christian public worship. The
people are afraid to meet together, and
with good reason.
Where the churches and chapels have
not been destroyed they are daily detiled.
I know of five or six priests from different
parishes, and they tell the same story.
The priest of the village of Hoghi says
that he returned to his village a few days
ago, that his house was mobbed at night,
that he is in hiding among his parishion
ers and that he began to resume relieious
services in a private house because his
church had been defiled by the Turks.
But the Turks forbade this service, and it
has been given up. The Protestant pastor
has not ventured to return.
The Turkish fast of Damazar began a
week ago. Moslem fanaticism is mani
fested more during these fasts than at
other times. Just about us we hare seen
no special display of it, but in distant Vil
lages a reign of terror has begun. The
Armenians who professed Mohammed
anism to save their lives are told that un
less they keep the fast they will be treated
as renegades, and the fate of renegades is
death. In other places, without anything
being said abovit the fast, they are told:
"We know that your profession is a farce,
but having made it, you are renegades,
and it is our duty to treat you as such."
Several persons who have fled from their
villages have asked what they can do. For
three months past we have made con
tinual representations through the proper
channels for information of the representa
tives of the Christian powers in Constanti
nople, as well as the local authorities, but
it has produced no visible effect.
A CONDITIONAL PARDON
Preacher - Swindler Howard's
Accomplices Are Released
From State Prison.
But They Must Keep Themselves
Within Reach of the Government
for Emergencies.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April I.â Warden
James of the State prison here, where C l .
B. F. Howard, the notorious preacher
swindler, and his associates are confined,
received a telegram from the Department
of Justice at "Washington to-day announc
ing that pardon papers for William G.
Gleeson, George H. Heatley and E. H.
Brockaway, the associates of Howard, have
been mailed to them.
Four persons were convicted with How
ard, one of whom, Edgar Smith, recently
died. They always claimed that they were
duped into the work by Howard, and the
Government evidently believes the story.
Howard's scheme was to defraud persons,
to whom he represented that there were
large fortunes waiting for them in Eng
land. Twenty-one indictments were found
against him. His conviction is said to
have cost the Government $75,000.
The pardons are granted upon the con
dition that these persons shall report their
place of residence to the United States
District Attorney for the Eastern District
of Tennessee and keep him informed of
any change of residence. They are to hold
themselves in readiness to appear at any
time as witnesses against Howard, who is
trying to get his liberty, and whom the
Government is anxious to convict on other
charges.

King is to be expelled at the end of sixty

Disappearance of an Embezzler.

varied programme. The eight different
events decided gave both the "dogs" and
the stake horses an opportunity of win
ning a purse, the first named being greatly
in the majority. The sport was good and
the attendance above the average.
Eddie Jones had many followers, but
experienced a run of ill luck, failing to
land a winner.
The followers of the favorites were also
badly routed, for but three managed to
reach the wire in front. Thirteen book
makers had their shingles up in the ring
and nearly all added to their "bank rolls."
It is very seldom that the conditions of
the races will allow the owner of Libertine
to start the big sprinter. When he does
get an opportunity ana manages to annex
a purse the next time he is entered the
handicapper feels it his autv to weight
him with a seven-story brick building and
a few tons of pig-iron. In the seven-fur
lonjfhandicap he was asked to pick up 123
pounds against the coast record-holder
Bellicoso, with 10t> pounds up. He was
made a 6 to 5 favorite, with Sallie Clicquot
ruling a strong second rhoice at 11 to 5,
around post time. Sallie went out to
make the running, but was deliberatelr
cut off by Sloan on Bellicoso at the four
and a half furlong pole. The latter then
had things all his own way, winning by a
length and a half in 1:27. The favorite
finished gamely, snatching the place from
Sallie Clicquot by a head.
Thirteen platers went to the post in the
opening event, a five-furlong scramble.
Arno was made a 3 to 1 favorite, but fin
ished third. Johnny Capron, a 15 to 1
shot, with W. Clancy up, took the lead in
the stretch and won easily from Yreka.
A favorite finally captured a race run
over the inside course. The distance was
seven furlones and Louis Ezell's Unity
was hammered down from twos to 13 to 10.
After looking to be out of it, he came with a
fine burst of speed at the end, passing the
wire a long length before Ike L.
The third race, another j^ieap five-fur
long dash, was taken very nandily by El
mer F. ridden by Shields, with post odds
of 5 to 1 against him. America, 8 long
priced outsider, was second, with the 7 to
5 favorite, Huntsman, in the show.
The mile and a half hurdle handicap
proved a go^d thing for Sir Reel, played
down from twos to 3 to 2. Spence sent
him out in front after taking the first
jump and, never headed, won easily by
three lengths. Arundul received the place
in a drive from April.
The race following tUc "leppers" was a
five-furlong tour for horses that through
various causes, acrobatic and otherwise,
had failed to gather in a purse since the
beginning of the present year. Seraphin
was a hot 7 to 5 choice in the betting, but
Road Warmer, who has been "just the
thing" on several occasions during the
past, led from the jump and won easily by
three lengths. Last Chance came fast
through the stretch, easily downing the
favorite for the place.
The owner of Ricardo probably consid
ered it quite an honor to start against such
a duo of sprinters as Crescendo and George
Miller and sent the chestnut out to get a
fleeting glimpse of the pair. The distance
was six furlongs and the great California
colt was a 7 to 20 favorite. He indulged
Miller with the lead until well on toward
the wire, when he headed him and won
comfortably by a Jength in 1:13)Â£.
The Burns 6c Waterhouse entry, Rose
bud, dumped the lovers of short-priced
horses hard in the last race, a mile run.
The mare was a 2 to 5 choice in the ring
and after running under a pull well into
the stretch was passed by both St. Lee and
Scimetar, the former winning by a length
in 1-Al%. The winner was quoted at 4 to 1
in the betting.

The contract has been let for the mac
nificent new clubhouse. The building
will be finished by October 1 and will cost
the club $20,000.
Interruption by the Court.
Lord Chief Justice Erie was prone to ln
terruDt counsel when it was found that
the Judges had already made up their
minds against him. On one occasion Mr.
Bovill, Q. C, soon afterward made a Judge,
was stopped with: "Here we stand, we
four men, and we have all firmly (empha
sizing the adverb) made up our miudsthat
there must be a new trial ; but if you think
it worth your while going on after that
(playfully), why of course we'll keep on
hearing you." Whereupon the Q. C.
laughingly sat down.
On another occasion he again inter
rupted with, "I beg to inform the counsel
there is a time in the mind of every man
at which he lets down the floodgates of hi 3
understanding, and allows not one more
drop to enter, and that time in my mind
has fully arrived."

ENFOBOE THE LAW.
ft is reported from Washington that
Eastern people are asking what policy
Californians favor in regard to the
settlement of the debts of the Pa
cific roaas. If this be true it would
seem that our campaign of education
against the funding scheme has been
wajred alhiost in vain. Over and over
again has it been declared that at this
juncture tne people of California have no
other policy than that of enforcing the ex
isting law. No other policy is needed.
The issue is a plain matter of business.
The debtor refuses to pay and the Gov
ernment should proceed in the regular
order of established law to foreclose the
! mortgage, take the property and get a de-
I iiciency judgment for the balance due.
There is no reason why the people of
California should undertake to formulate
any policy different from that pursued up
to this time. There are people in this
j State who favor the possession and cpera-
I tion of the roads by the Government it
self, and there are people who are opposed
to that plan. There are some who would
like to see the roads sold to a strong com
pany that would give us a competitive
transcontinental system, and there are
others who have objections to that. Ail
are agreed, however, that almost any plan
is better than that of refunding tne debt
and that the law should be enforced and
the mortgage foreclosed.
Any refunding measure whether for a
hundred years or forty years, whether for
2 per cent or for 3 per cent, would involve
many things of evil import to California.
It would continue the power of the monop
oly and leave us exposed as now to exac
tions that hamper ever}' industry, check
every form of development and restrict all
our energies. It would prolong that con
test between the people and th c monopoly
which has been so fruitful a source of po
litical evils and kept the State incessantly
disturbed by antagonisms and distrust. It
would surrender the dignity of law by
conceding favors to the demands of a rich
corporation that would not be granted to
the pleadings of the needy. It would be in
fact a concession to corruption and a
measure of measureless evils.
The policy of the people of California is
the fulfillment of the law as it stands. Not
long ago a single message from the Presi
dent was shown to be all that was sufficient
to enforce the Monroe doctrine against the
antagonism of England in the face of an
unwilling world. A single declaration from
Congress in favor of a resolute enforcement
of the law will bring the monopoly to
terms. A nation that can stand against
the world can certainly stand against a
defaulting corporation, and should not be
alarmed by any threat that the corporation
won't pay.
Enforce the law.
THE TAEIPF REVIEWED.
One of the ablest, fairest and most
searching inquiries into the Tariff question
that has yet been made has been written
by T. B. Walker of Minneapolis. It? key
note is expressed in the following postu-
Jaies:
'A nation dependent upon agriculture
only may possess a large population and
produce a superabundant food supply, but
will always be loaded with foreign debt
and subject to panic and hard times.
"Where manafactures, commerce and
mining are abundantly encouraged and
protected the nation may, with a limited
ability to compete in Bgriculture, stand in
the front rank.
"This Nation, with its incomparable ad
vantages, can lead all others in wealth,
power, independence and continuous
prosperity, if its labor and capital are suf
ficiently encouraged and protected."
There are some nations in a position to
profit by a high tariff and others that
would suffer by the adoption of such a pol
icy. Thus England would only further
impoverish its millions of laborers by im
posing a tariff on provisions, and a pro
tective tariff on manufactured goods
would be idle in view of the fact that Eng
land not only supplies her own needs in
that regard, but secures much of her pros
perity by exporting them in large quanti
ties. Hence, as the author says, "A tariff
on imported manufactured goods would
produce no revenues and a tariff on pro
visions would destroy their supremacy."
In the United States we find an exactly
opposite condition of things. While the
necessary policy of England in extending
her commerce requireo low wages, America
has unlimited resources sufficient for the
people and capable of producing high
wages if they are intelligently fostered
and a wholly unnecessary competition
with the industrial conditions of Europe
prevented. A low tariff manifestly tends
to create such a competition and thus re
duce the ptate of our people to that of the
poverty-stricken hordes of the Old World.
Not only is this the tendency, but it
must be expected that a low tariff will
tend to bring on panics by inducing large
importations of foreign goods, a heavy
drain on the gold of the country, depres
sion of manufactures and a consequent
demand for settlements that cannot be
met. The contention of Mr. Carlisle and
his followers that these results of the
Democratic tariff are chargeable to the
National monetary system cannot be
maintained in view of the plain proposi
tion that heavy imports mean a large out
flow of gold, and that it means just the
same to the country whether the gold is
sent to Europe by an importer or is re
moved directly from the National treasury
for export in the settlement of trade bal
ances.
Discontent, with resulting strikes, ap
pears among the laboring classes only
when times are hajd and poverty pinches.
Such movements as these are a natural
and inevitable protest against a tendency
to fall into the poverty, hopelessness and
helplessness so conspicuous among the
laborers of Europe.
THE GROWING DEHOIT.
As was foreseen and predicted the treas
ury statements for March show expendi
tures in excess of revenues for that month,
and the total deficit for the nine months
that have elapsed of the current fiscal year
is now about $19,000,000. During 'this
month there are large amounts of interest
to be paid, and as there is little hope of
increased revenues the monthly shortcom
ing will be much greater than that for
March, so that all hope of keeping the de
ficit for the year below $25,000,000 must
now be abandoned even by that sanguine
estimator Mr. Carlisle himself.
Ever since the income tax was declared
unconstitutional it has been known to
statesmen and Btudents of our financial
system that under the existing laws the
revenues would not equal the necessary
expenditures of the country. Even with
the income that might hare been derived
THE SAN FRAjSCISUU CALL., THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
from that tax there would have been little
to spare as the customs duties under the
Wilson tariff had been cut down to 9uit
the policy of parsimony which Democrats
call economy. Under the circumstances,
therefore, had there been any sagacious
leaders in the Democratic party they
would have co-operatea with Republicans
of Congress to pass any kind of emergency
bill to obtain the needed revenues. They
preferred, however, to obstruct every bill
of the kind, and as a consequence they
have now to meet the people as the advo
cates of a revenue system which is running
the country into debt every month.
The man mainly responsible for this
blunder of the Democratic party is Secre
tary Carlisle. He has been their evil
counselor at every step in the fatuous
policy they have pursued on this subject.
He has again and again prepared estimates
for them, showing that there would be a
surplus revenue "next month." With
each succeeding month there has been a
new boom estimate sent out for the use of
the administration speakers in the House
and the Senate. At first they were em
ployed with great courage and confidence,
and it was clear that some of tne orators
at any rate sincerely believed in them.
Now, however, they are used no more.
Successive disappointments have chilled
the faith, even of the cuckoos, and Car
lisle is left to defend his position for him
self by juggling figures as best he can.
It is not wholly bad for the country that
this silly policy of bluster and folly has
been pursued. It is just as well that the
people should see the results of the Demo
cratic tariff workea out to the full. The
deficit stands there for all to see, and it
will increase with the months until the
fools have been turned out of office and
statesmen returned to power.
PAEMING IN CITIES.
The New York Association for Improv
ing the Condition of the Poor has been in
spired by the remarkable success of Mayor
Pingree of Detroit, the originator of the
pian for farming vacant lots in cities. Al
though the Pingree idea was put in opera
tion as late as 1804 and had only two yearÃ
of demonstration, it has proved successful
beyond all calculation and may be re
garded as the most promising of modern
philanthropic movements. It might seem
strange that a great and crowded city like
New York, with its uncounted thousands
of suffering poor, could produce a sufficient
number ot accessible vacant lots with
which to try the Detroit experiment in the
hope of ameliorating the suffering* of an
appreciable number of poor people, but
the association has gone earnestly to work
and has already made some important dis
coveries. It has issued a report showing
that there are 17,329 vacant lots (more than
1400 acres) in the city below West One
Hundred and Forty-fifth street and the
Harlem, and announces that if the vacant
land be within three miles of the homes of
the poor they will use it. If the land is
sterile it can be enriched from excavations
and street refuse. It is confidently ex
pected that New York will make the ven
ture successful. If it be true of that city,
where the obstacles are greater than in
any other, every city in the country will
have any easy task. New \ork is not
nlone in adopting the Detroit plan. Buf
falo, Omaha and Seattle have assailed the
problem of relieving the unemployed by
the same means.
The lessons already learned are these:
1. A large number of the destitute are
â willing to work if they have the oppor
tunity.
2. A very small piece of ground will fur
nish a family sufficient food.
3. "The needy are thereby assisted with
out creating the demoralization in the
habits of the people that gratuitous help
always entails.''
As much of the future greatness of Cali
fornia will come from a more thorough de
velopment of its agricultural resources, the
subject has a peculiar interest for the
cities of this State. The immediate relief
which it brings to thÂ« poor is by no means
the sum of its benefit.-*. Beyond that con
sideration lie others of lasting value. This
is indicated in the following report by F.
B. Dickerson, superintendent of poor of
Detroit: ''The poor, hard-working people
see that upon a little patch of half an acre
they can produce enough to half support
themselves, and it sets them to thinking.
They reason thus, 'If I can almost live
on half an acre I could make a comfortable
living on a few acres,' and they begin to
lisnire on getting into the country. In
answer to a qnestion asked me, I asserted
that at least 100 families had sought and
found homes in the country as a direct re
sult of their experience of last year. I fell
far short of the mark, however, for one
gentleman, the Hon. Joseph Waltz of
Waltz, Mich, (a small village in this coun
ty), writes: 'I see in the papers what you
say about city farming, and think you are
right in the matter, ay twenty-five families
from the city have located hereabouts. If
twenty-five families have located in the
vicinity of one little village, the number
of families who have located in other sec-
tions of the State must far exceed 100."

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Andrew Young, chairman of the Board of
Supervisors of Story County, Nevada, and
acting Mayor of Virginia City, is at the Russ.
Since the famous camp of the Comstock lode
disincorporated no Mayor has been elected,
aud the duties requisite in such cases have
devolved on the chairman of the Supervisors.
Mr. Young is one of the best-known men In
that part of the country. He has lived for
thirty-seven years at Virginia and worked, as
he expresses jt, "for fifteen years under
ground," for he is a practical miner and
knows all the ins and outs of a miner's life.
He was for several years secretary and for
several years more treasurer of the Miners'
Union, one of the largest organizations in the
country.
He believes that the troubles of Tangerman

the right man under the circumstances for

miners is that Tangerman took two positions
for less than the previous pay of one of them.
There are, Mr. Young states, between 400
and 500 members of the union in Virginia
City, not to speak of Gold Hill. They have a
large hall and also a library of some 4000 vol
umes. In tiie library are tho current muga
zines and daily papers, so that in many re
spects the headquarters of the union is like a
club. It has been of much value to the min
ers. The initiation is but $5 and the
dues but 50 cents a month, but there have
been at times thousands of dollars on hand to
relieve sick or injured members, or to pay ex
penses of burial.
"I never saw in all the time I have resided
at Virginia," said Mr. Young, "such freedom
from snow as during this winter. There is no
snow whatever at Virginia. The day before I
left it rained all day. The streets have been so
clear for the winter that instead of rive or six
feet of snow, the customary thing, we have bi
cyclists going to and fro. Oftentimes you may
look down the street and see as many *s ten or
fifteen persons on bicycles."

A DUCK'S STRANGE FREAK.
One of the oldest ducks in Sun Francisco is
named Tom, and he belongs to Charles Young,
who lives in the Potrero, about two blocks
back from the shores of the bay. Tom is nearly
six years old and up 1o a few months ago was
always dignified and as correct in his demeanor
as the ordinary duck. About that time, how
ever, he became possessed of a strange desire to
accumulate all the old shoes on the water front.
Early every morning he sturts out by himself
and is often gone for several hours. When he
returns he is sure to bring an old shoe and
store it away in the poultry-house. As soon as

[From a ttetch.]
he feels satisfied that nobody will interfere
with it, he starts out again and soon returns
with another. He will keep this up nil day
and if shoes are plentiful will have several
dozens in places stored away by nightfall.
Tom had been at this peculiar business for
several days before he wus discovered, and
when his owner went to the poultry-house and
saw the piles of old footwear, he thought that
he was being made the victim of a practical
joke. lie dumped the old shoes oat and whs
more than surprised to see Tom deliberutely
Btnrt to carry them back again. Young carried
the shoes us far away as he could, but in a few
hours the duck had them where he wanted
them and started out for more.
Since Tom has been in the shoe business he
lias forsaken the other ducks altogether and
reems to have but the one desire in life.
People who have seen him think that it is a
cose of the duck going crazy.
Mr. Young has given Tom his own way the
last six months and made it a business to
throw the shoes out every few days, so as to
give him a chance to carry them back again.
But ho says It is getting monotonous and that
il Tom don't get over his foolishness soon be
will be forced to try a remedy that will surely
cure him, although he hates this, because Tom
is too old and tough to make good eating.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE TUOLUMNE RIVER.
PROJECT TO HAVE IT DECLAKED A PUBLIC
HIGHWAY.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
My attention was this day called to an edito
rial in your issue of March 24 on the subject
of the Supervisors of Tuolumne County declar
ing that portion of Tuolumne River now un
navigable a public highway. As my interests
are probably greater than those of any one
individual I desire to make some explanation
concerning the facts in the case. In the first
place there is no lumber company or Eastern
parties interested in or connected with it at
all. I made the application over a year ago.
I know of no company or individual who ha 3
immediate interest in the petition or applica
tion except my two associates who reside in
Sonora, Tuolumne County, and myself. I live
in can Francisco aud intend to reside here the
remainder of my days. I have timber interests
on the Tuolumne River and have made the
proposition to clear out the obstructions of
the unnavigafole portions of the middle and
south forks of the Tuolumne, without
expense to the county, and make it
navigable for logs and' lumber, if the
Supervisors will give me the protection which
they alone have the power to grant. I have no
desite to control the water and would only
wish to drive logs from four to six weeks in the
spring when the water is at its height, nnd ten
times more water than the miners and farmers
can use. I should not in any way divert the
water from the stream or interfere with irriga
tion facilities or the generation of electrical
energy for industrial uses. On the contrary,
the more dams bmlt on the streams the better
I shall be pleased. What opposition I have
met with has come principally from people
who have no interest in Tuohimne or anyother
county, but delight in oppoHing everything in
the line of progression. A petition recently
circulated in favor of my proposition hus met
with t lie approval and signature of most of the
reliable and tax-paying residents of the county,
imd I earnestly hope that the Supervisors will
see their way cleur to comply with my request,
as it seems to me an opportunity to have their
river improved, which the county cannot af
ford to lose. C. Elwood Brown.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Ever since the production of "Cavalleria
Rusticana," which occurred nearly six years
ago, Mascagni has continued to complete new
operas, not one of which has met with the
startling success of the prize work from which
little or nothing was expected. p "L'Amico
Fritz" scarcely met with a success of esteem;
"Ratcliffe" was lauded to the skies by the
Italian press, and then it dropped almost out
of sight. As for "Silvano," even Mascagni's
warmest friends owned that it was nothing but
a pendant to "La Cavalleria Rusticana." If it
were not for the "Cavalleria" we should not be
able to hum a bar of Mascaerni's music to-day
in America. The young composer has just pro
duced another work, however, which seems
likely to eclipse his first opera in popularity.
It is called "Zanetto," and has just been pro
duced at Pessaro, where Mascagni is director
of the Musical Lyceum. The first performance
of "Zanetto" was awaited with great impa
tience all over Italy, and all the large towns
sent special correspondents to telegraph de
tailed accounts of the work. Mascagni's native
city of Florence was represented by a large
delegation of friends and admirers. Every one
is unanimous in stating that the success of
"Cavalleria Rusticana" is more than repeated
in "Zanetto." The opera plays for scarcely an
hour and the traditional intermezzo is con
spicuous by its absence. There is also no over
ture and the work begins with an invisible
chorus, sung Dehind the scenes. The music of
this chorus so delighted the public that it was
found to be useless to raise the curtain and
proceed with the performance till it had been
repeated. One enthusiastic critic says that
"Zanetto" gives a complete idea of the renais
sance of Italian operatic art.
In spite of the great success of "Zanetto,"
Mascagni is being a good deal gibed at by the
European press. It was in connection with
the celebration of Rossini's centenary at Pesaro
that "Zanetto" was produced, and many news
papers are remarking that under such circum
stances ho would have shown better taste by
completely effacing his own personality before
that of the illustrious master vr\ am the cen
tenary was to glorify. These papi â¢: s recall the
fact that a few years ago, when Ver<ii directed
the orchestra for some fetes at Milan In Ros
sini's honor, he carefully abstained from ac
cepting any applause on his own account and
"forgot his own personality to honor that of
the great Rossini." This was certainly an
exquisite proof of Verdi's tact, and one In
which Mascagni has shown himself to be lack
ing. His Rossini centenary at Pesaro be
gan with a concert, the programme of which
was somewhat strange, as a tribute to the
"Swan of Pesaro." It began with two over
tures by Rossini, that of "William Tell" and
"La Cambiale di Matrimonio." Beethoven's
"Eroica" symphony and the largo by Handel fol
lowed. Then came excerpts from "Lohengrin"
and 'â¢Tannhauser." The coupling of Rossini's
name with that of Wagner at a Rossini festival
is considered by many critics to have been an
almost grotesque bit of comedy on Mascagni's
part.
It is evident, however, that Mascagni has set
tled down seriously to work since accepting
the musical directorship of Pesaro. For a time
after the success of "Cavalleria Rusticana" the
young composer posed as a man about town,
frequented the races and was noted for the
large sums he lost at the gambling-tables.
Celebrations of composers' centenariei are
becoming as popular in Europe as fiestas are
in California and unhappy indeed is the city
that cannot boast of having given birth to at
least one writer on music who came on the
scene of life about a century ago. The town of
Pescia, in Italy, which is an enterprining little
community, wanted to have its centenary
along with the rest, but the dusty city regis
ters were searched in vain for indications that
a musician of note had had the good taste to
be born in Pescia during the year of grace
1796. At last some genius recalled the fact
that G'oranni Pacini, Rossini's old friend, had
Mascagni as a Sport.
died at Pescia, and that it was just a century
since he had first seen the light of day at
Cataneo. A committee was at once formed to
celebrate Pacini's centenary, and neither
money nor pains are being ypared for a grand
celebration on the 12th of this month, which
would be Pucini's hundredth birthday if he
was still alive. Rival cities are asking indig
nantly what right Pescia has to celebrate the
centenary of a composer who showed his con
tempt for the town by dying there, but the
people of Pescia say they took the initiative,
and they would like to see Cataneo, or any
other city, that could rob them oi their cen
tenary. Pacini was certainly a monumental
enough composer to arouse local pride. When
he was only 17 his first opera was presented at
Milan, and during the half-century of his
working life he wrote and caused to be pro
duced no less than seventy-one operas. At his
death Pacini left sixteen more partly written
operas, which he had not time to complete.
"The Grand Duke," Gilbert and Sullivan's
new opera, is giving great satisfaction to the
Londoners, though the general verdict seems
to be that age has robbed Gilbert of some of his
wit as a librettist, while it has mellowed Sulli
van's powers as a composer. It would be inter
esting to know the particular Grand Duke that
Gilbert had in mind when he devised the lead
ing character in his new opera, for one thing
that has made this librettist's wit lose its flavor
in crossing the Atlantic is that most of his
leading roles are satires on well-known and
prominent people in Great Britain. It is pos
sible that the Grand Duke is a combination of
many characters, though it would be easy to
point to the hero of the lines:
By a poshing young monarch, of turn energetic,
A very great deal may be done in a day.
Gilbert calls nis potentate the Grand Duke of
Pfenning-Halbpfenning; he is supposed to
have flourished in the last century, and Pass
more, who plays the role, depicts him as a cow
ardly fellow, wearing a dusty coat covered
with orders, and alternating. between ridicu
lously assumed dignity and amusing low buf
foonery. The extraordinary melange of theat
rical and court life is no doubt intended for
foreign circulation. Mme. yon Palmay, as the
' Grand Duchess, is the "hit" of the whole per
formance.
Albert Kauders' opera, "Walther yon der Vo
gelweide," which has already been played with
success at the German Theater of Prague, has
just met with an enthusiastic reception at the
Imperial Opera of Vienna. The celebrated
minnesinger, Walther yon der Vogelweide,
plays a role in the oj>era that iÂ£ more remark
able for its romantic development than for its
fidelity to history.
An enterprising Milanese editor, Curio Ali
prandi, has done his best to canonize Giuseppe
Verdi. On Giuseppe's dny (St. Joseph's Day) he
published a special edition of his paper, La
Farfulla, in honor of Giuseppe Verdi. Com
posers, singers, poets, dramatic authors, etc.,
were all specially invited to collaborate in the
St. Joseph's day edition.
The San Carlos Theater, Lisbon, has just pro
duced "Irene," the opera by the Portuguese
composer, Alfred Keil, which was played for
the first time some years ago at the Royal The
ater, Turin. The Lisbon public received their
compatriot's work with enthusiasm, and he
was called before the curtain twenty times.
A new opera by the Czech composer, Zdenko
Fiebich, has been played with success at
Prague. The subject is drawn from Byron's
"Don Juan," and, like Auber's work, is en
titled "Haydee." The second act and the bal
let of the last act were especially applauded.
On St. Agnes' day a new solemn mass was
produced at the cathedral of Cataneo, Italy,
which is spoken of in terms of the highest
praise. The mass is by Domenico Cambria, a
young maestro who has only just reached his
eighteenth year.

A POPULAR SKIRT.
The skirt shown here is a modification of the
Marie Antoinette skirt, which is so much worn
at present at Paris. Tiie front gore, over which
the side gores are laid to form a pleat in sem
blance to a skirt laid over it. is usually made
of a contrasting fabric.
A figured white crepe de chine.with the front
of white plain satin and trimmed with clotÂ«Â«
set rows of yellow lace, is worn with a fichn of
the same, the rest of the waist being of the
figured goods.
A skirt of gray crepon with the front of a
handsome brocade with gray ground and
bright flounces and hems is exquisite.
Brown mohair, with white mohair for the
front breadth and trimming for the waist, is
extremely stylish.
Of course the skirt may be made of one fabric,
the lapping sides may be fastened down with
three large buttons on each side, set to reach
half way down. The introduction of two fab
rics is a step in the direction of a seriout
change in skirts which have been severely
plain and without trimming for so long.

CAPTAIN MORTON
IS UNDER FIRE
Golden Gate Life-Saving
Station to Be Investi
gated.
INCOMPETENCE CHARGED
Washington Authorities Order a
Rigid Inquiry Which
Begins To-Day.
THE BOAT WAS OVERTURNED.
The Present Keeper Charged With
Being Responsible for the Ac
cident.
The United States life-saving service
will begin to-day an investigation of
Go lden Gate station â the station on the
Ocean Beach on which vessels in distress
in the neighborhood of the Golden Gate
depend for succor in time of neeci.
Captain Harry Morton is in command
of the station, and it is his acts that are
under inquiry by the department.
Several months ago he displaced Captain
Henry Smith, who had been in charge for
a considerable period. The old crew re
mained after Captain Smith's departure,
but it was not long before murmurs of dis
satisfaction arose and the men declined to
serve under the new commander of the
boat, on the ground that he was incom
petent and that their lives were in danger.
Their places were soon filled by new men
more congenial to Captain Morton.
The old crew were not satisfied with re
signing their positions, but tiled charges
against Captain Morton, alleeing many
things to prove his incompetence and ask
ing that for the safety not only of the crew
but for that of shipwrecked sailors who
might be ariven on the coast he be re
moved.
The matter was taken up by the local
office of the service, of which Major BlaKe
ney is the head, and an investigation held.
The men were on hand to give their testi
mony, and a mass of evidence was
taken and considered by the office. The
findings were far from satisfactory to the
complaining witnesses, and they at once
appealed the matter to Washington, al
leging many acts of Captain Morton that
were not brought out at the original in
vestigation. Nothing was heard from the
department until a few days ago. when
orders were received from Washington to
have the entire matter reopened and a
strict investigation held.
Stranee to say the local office was not
consulted in the matter, and the whole
inquiry was placed in the hands of a naval
officer who will take the evidence and
transmit the same to headquarters at
Washington. This action of the National
authorities is regarded as somewhat in the
light of a rebuff to Major Blakeuey, in the
light of the refusal of the authorities to
accept his findings as final.
The main incident on which the old
crew bases the charges of incompetence
happened on November 13 last and nar
rowly escaped causing the death of a num
ber of the crew, among them Captain
Morton.
The small surfboat was ordered out with
the intention of taking her around into the
bay, either by orders of the service authori
ties or for her regular practice. In the face
of breakers that were rolling in with about
their usual force the pretty craft was
shoved into the water and the crew clam
bered in.
Before she had gone more than a few
feet from the beach something went wrong
and in a twinkling she was upside down
in the treacherous waves with a portion of
the crew underneath. The unde"rtow at
the point where the launch was attempted
is at all times dangerous even to men un
incumbered with clothing, and those who
had witnessed the accident from the snore
soon saw that some of the men were in
serious difficulties and in danger of their
lives and rushed to the rescue.
Three of the crew, including Captain
Morton, had become entangled in the
ropes and tackle of the boat, and were in
great danger when the rescuers reached
the beach.
Tne first man to reach the scene was the
barkeeper ot a neighboring resort, who
with the instinct of his caljing had seized
a bottle of whisky as he rushed from the
house, to be handy in case of need.
A short, stout man was the first to
emerge from the breakers, and to him the
bottle was offered, but the sailor remarked
that he was already too full of salt water
to hold any more liquid, and dashed back
into the water to rescue his comrades.
The whisky came in handy when the half
drowned men were dragged ashore.
The members of the old crew claim that
Captain Morton's lack of proper manage
ment caused the accident, and point to
the fact that a few years ago several men
were hurt and one killed at the Point
Reyes station through a similar upset.
All of the members of the old crew now
in this City will be present to-day when
the investigation is opened.
Captain Coulson, the Assistant Inspec
tor of the United States Life-saving Ser
vice stationed in this City, was reticent
about the matter, when asked regarding
(he nature of the investigation last even
ing, but admitted that an inquiry would
be held to-day in regard to certain charges
made against Captain Morton.
The names of the members of the old
crewâ the complainants against Captain
Mortonâ with their boat numbers, are as
follows:
No. 1, Samue! Anderson; No. 2, William
Schuler; No. 3, Jonas Robinson; No. 4,
Henry Bell; No. 5, James Swan: No. 6,
William Cunningham; No. 7, James Ãaslt;
No. 8, John Connelly.
Captain Morton claims that the over
turning of the boat was the result of a
conspiracy, the tackle having been pur
posely disabled the night before, the men
hoping to have him ousted, on charges
based on the incident.

AN EXPRESS COMBINE.
Several Companies That Do Business
Here Are Preparing to
Unite.
A combination of several of the ex
press and baggage companies doing
business in San Francisco, Oakland,
Alameda and Berkeley is being formed,
and the result will be a powerful com
pany or corporation that will enter
into competition with the Pacific Trans
fer Company, Morton's Special Delivery
Company and others.
The concerns that are expected to go
into the combination are the "Whitney
Transfer Company, the People's Express,
Anderson's Oakland Express Company,
Sharpe's Alameda Transfer Company
and the Patterson Express of Berkeley.
The Greeley Company, carrying express
between this City and" Alameda, is not go-

ing into the combine, a representative of
that company says, and there will proba
bly be a lively fight for the Alameda ex
press business in consequence if the ex
pected combination is effected.
Most of the companies mentioned have
heretofore kept out of the San Francisco
field, except to carry express and baggage
between this City and the cities on the
other tide of the bay, but expressmen who
are not in the combine assert that a gen
eral San Francisco business is intended.
It is anticipated that a cut in the rates
acros? the bay will be made in order to
drive the small rivals out of the field.
FOR NARROW SIDEWALKS
The Proposition of Widening
Folsom Street Almost
Assured.
Bids to Be Advertised in July for
Bituminiziug the Thorough
fare to the Bay.
The executive committee of the Folsom
ftreet Improvement Club held a sptcial
meeting last night at the office of A. P.
McDonald to receive the reports of the
sub-committees appointed to interview
property-owners along Folsom street in
regard to the widening of the street and
the narrowing of the sidewalks from Ninth
street to Third.
The reports were so favorable that the
proposition of narrowing the walks seems
an assured thing; of the entire number of
property-owners approached by the com
mittees only two have expressed them
selves as against it.
P. Heyfron reported that he was sure of
1000 feet of the 1600 between Third and
Fourth. John Hannan and J. M. Strauss
said that more than two-thirds of the
people between Fourth and Fifth streets
were favorably inclined. Miss Borden re
ported the block between Fifth and Sixth
favorable. Mr. Meeks failed to send a re
port from between Bixth and Seventh
streets. Captain George Raabe reported
the majority of property-owners between
Seventh and Eighth were highly in favor
of the proposition, and George Catz said a
large number were for it between Eighth I
and Ninth, but as yet he could not guaran
tee a majority.
On motion of A. B. Maguire the invita
tion from the committee of arrangements
for the mass-meeting to be held at Mission
Turn Verein Hall, April 4, was received
and accepted.
It was stated that the Supervisors had
signified their intention to the people
along Folsom street that next July bids
would be advertised for the bituminizing
of that thoroughfare from Third street to
the wharf.
A vote of thanks was tendered P. Hey
fron for his services in the matter of the
sidewalKs.
A committee of five was appointed, the
members to be named tmbsequently by
the chair, to interview the Market-street
Railroad officials next Friday and ask
them why the work on the Folsom-street
car line had not been begun as agreed.
The time of meeting the railroad people
wa3 afterward postponed until Monday.

In Jail for Pocket-Picking.
Jnmes Bowler, a florist, was arrested last
evening by Officer T. J. Conuell at the instance
of Mrs. Pauline Spuhr and detained at the
California-street police station on a charge of
grand larceny. Mrs. Spuhr alleges thut while
walking along O'Farrell street Monday after
noon a young man who, if not the prisoner,
greatly resembles him, took a purse from her
pocket which contained $(>7. Bowler denies
that he robbed the woman, and says that it is
a case of mistaken identity on her part.
He Will Return and Explain.
F. L. Hansen, the contractor of the Presidio
barracks, who was supposed to have left the
City to avoid his creditors, was heard from yes
terday afternoon by P. M. Kuss of 422 Sutter

prised to see his name and picture in the morn
ing papers, and says he expects to return to
the City by Friday, when he will be able to
straighten out matters in general.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
A Most Exciting Ocean Race
Over an Eight Thousand
Mile Course.
FINISHED TWO HOUBS APAET.
The Two Vessels Started From
London Within Five Minutes
of Each Other.
One of the most exciting and closest
ocean races ever engaged in was that be-
tween the British ships Arctic Stream and
Cromdale, now in port. They left the
starting-point within five minutes of each
other and, after battling against contrary
winds over an eight thousand mile course,
there was only a difference of two hours
between them at the finish. Although a
much smaller vessel, the Arctic Stream
held her own throughout, and on a ton
nage allowance would have won hands
down. Captain Bowen is. well satisfied
with the showinj; made by his vessel and
is of the opinion tLat if the race was run
over it would be his vessel that would be
two hours ahead at the end of the voyage.
The Cromdale and Arc'io Stream left Lon
don on August 1 iast. Down thechannel the
vessels scudded along tinder lower topsails
and reefed loresaii. As they disappeared
from view there was not a hundred yards
between them, and the tugboat caotains
remarked to each other that it was going
to be a close race. Both vessels were bound
for Sydney, N. S. W., and Captain Andrew
and Captain Bowen sighted each other
three times during the race. After getting
ciear of the channel they ran across each
other again when fourteen days out. Then
they lost sight of each other for a month
and a half and then on the third occasion
when they were both making their easting
from Tristan u'Acunha.
During the entire run of 8403 miles the
vessels were nearly all the time under two
or three topsails and reefed foresail, yet,
nevertheless, the average was 240 miles a
day. The Cromdale and Arctic Stream
both came here from Sydney, N. S. W.,
the former with 3111 tons of coal and the
latter with 2312 tons. On this occasion
the Cromdale won easily, as she made the
run in seventy-four days, while the Arctic
Stream tooK eighty days to cover the dis
tance. This was not a test of the sailing
qualities of the two ships, however, as
light and burning winds prevailed nearly
all the way from Australia to San Fran
cisco. The}' are not likely to meet again
for some time, as the Arctic Stream is go
ing back to .Sydney, N. S. W., with a load
of wheat anil the Cromdale is not yet
chartered.
The Pacific Mail Company's Central
American steamers will continue to use
Lombard - street wharf for incoming
freight until the busy season is over. The
Acapulco will dock there on her arrival
from Panama and after discharging will
go to the Mail dock to load. Lombard
street wharf is now being put in thorough
repair and if the fruitmen can come to an
understanding it will be turned over to
them as soon as the exchange is estab
lished.
During the busiest hour of the day a
flashlight picture of the scene on the floor
of the Merchants' Exchange was taken
yesterday. The photograpner secured a
good negative and some of the most promi
nent men '"on 'Change" show up well.
Captain Hawley, superintendent of the
Spreckels Towboat Company and Captain
Gray of the Shipowners and Merchants'
Towboat Company appear in one cor
ner discussing the ups and downs
in the life of a towboat cap
tain. Pilot Freeman of the Bonita,
Captain C. Miner Goodall and Captain
Houdlette of the Australia made up an
other group, but the most interesting trio
will be "Big" Jordan, "Little" Jordan
and "Medium" Jordan. The first two
stand in the front rank of skillful pilots
and the third is a well-known water
front reporter for the Examiner. They
make an imposing combination. Perhaps
one of the best groups of all will be that
of J. Daly, A. Marks and W. Downs, the
courteous and obliginn clerks of the ex
change.
The steam schooner Newsboy broke her
shaft during the run to San Francisco and
had to reach oort under sail. She will
discharge and dock for repairs.
During the past month .the following

school and have received their certificates
from the Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers:
E. 0. Smith, mate of ocean steamer; I.

Some facetious individual, in order to
celebrate "April Fools'" day, nailed a
nickel on the sidewalk at the corner of
Market and Sacramento streets yesterday.
Every boatload of people who "came over
Jrom Oakland produced irom 50 to 100 peo
ple who ai tempted to pick up thats-cent
piece, and it was ludicrous to see the men
straighten themselves up and try to appear
unconcerned in spite of the laughter of the
newsboys who were on to the joke. During
the rooming hours fully a thousand men,
women and children attempted to pick
up that nickel and got laughed at for their
pains. Finally when the scramble for it
began to obstruct the traffic, Officer Charles
Callaghan removed the offending coin.
COURTESY TO YAMAGATA
The Marshal of Japan Received a Sa

Presidio.
Marquis Yamagata, marshal of Japan,
and suite had a trip around the bay on the
tug Fearless yesterday. The marshal was
accompanied by General Forsyth and
staff and General Giaham, U. S. A. ; Chief
Engineer Fletcher A. Wileon, U.S. N. ;
Irving M. Scott, Henry T. Scott, Henry J.

The tug returning steamed around Alca

the wharf of the reservation at 2 o'clock in

The arrival of the field marshal at the
Presidio was announced by a salute of
seventeen guns, fired by Battery L. Fifth
Artillery. The 8-inch pieces near the bay
gave tone and volume to the salute.
Marshal Yamagata and suite stepped

A PIONEER'S SUDDEN END
Charles J. Spaulding Dies on the
Street of Paralysis of
the Brain.
He Came to California in Forty-Nine
With His Parents and Was a
Well-Known Boniface.
Charles J. Spaulding died suddenly at
2 :40 o'clock yesterday afternoon at the cor
ner of Golden Gate avenue and Larkin
street. He had been ailing for some time
from paralysis of the brain and the im
mediate cause of death is attributed to this
affliction.
Mr. Spaulding was a hotel man. He had
been in the hotel business all his life and
was well known in this community. He
was 59 years of age and leaves a widow and
ssven children, four boys and turee girls,
to mourn his cml. He was formerly pro
prietor of the Lick House bar.
The deceased was a life member of the
Society of California Pioneers and also an
exempt fireman. He came to tins State
from New York with his father, who was
a gunsmith and carried on business for
years in this City, in 1849, and resided
here permanently since that time.
The deceased had not been actively en
gaged in business of late. He arose yes
terday morning feeling as well as usual,
and at noon went downtown and called at
the office of the Pioneer Society. It was
while returning home that he fell ex
hausted on the sidewalk and died almost
immediately. He died within a block of
his home.
SEEN IN THE GLASS.
The Microscope Exposes Adulterated
Paris Green Frauds On Ungui
pecting Orchardl9ts.
At the meeting of the San Francisco
Microscopical Society at Montgomery and
Sacramento streets last evening, M. E.
Jaffa, assistant professor of chemistry at
the University of California, gave a dem
onstration oi tests for the purity of paris
green.
Since the ingredient began to be used
extensively for killing the codlin-moth in
orchards, it has been shamefully adulter
ated by wholesale chemists and dealers
with the result that its efficacy was im
paired.
Professor Jaffa conducted a series of ex
periments, under the direction of Pro
fessor Hilpard, at the university agricul
tural station and obtained satisfactory
results. These he demonstrated last even
ing hefore the microseopists.
Me showed that the grosser adulterants
â with certain affinities tor paris green are
easy of detection, since their greater spe
cific gravity caused them to be precipi
tated when the adulterated paris green of
commerce was mixed with water.
Glauber salts was tried by the dealers,
and it united perfectly with the paint
powder. It also melted" free'y in water,
and so the farmer was baffled. Under the
microscope this adulterant was visible,
however.* Mr. Jaffa showed that paris
green under the microscope had the ap
pearance of a collection of minute globules
when pure. When mixed with salts, how
ever, the adulterant was discernable in
crystals among the globules. A plain in
strument with a power as low as 75
diameter would detect the so It crystals.
Bepublicun Lady Delegates.
The executive committee of the Woman's
State Central Republican Club will recommend
that Mrs. Addie L. Ballou, Mrs. Nellie Hol
brook Bl'.nn and Mrs. Dr. Xoble represent their
club as delegates to the Republican State Con
vention. The report will be acted upon at the
meetintr Â©f the club on Wednesday evening,
the 15th inst., at the Baldwin Hotel.
Iturned by a Fuse.
John Carbley, employed in the California
electrical works at 35 Market street, was in
jured by a burning electric fuse yesterday
afternoon. The dynamo burned out and a
small blaze was sterted in the premises. An
alarm was turned in from bnx 32, but the ser
vices of the iiremen were not needed.
The Bicycle Thief.
H. M. Hafford, ex-letter-cnrrier, who was nr
rested lnst week for stealing five bicycles from
different cycleries, was yesterdny held by Judge
Jonchimseh to tinswer before" the Superior
Court on two charges of grand larceny in $2000
bonds on each charge. The three other charges
are yet to be disposed of.

Cantilever Bridge on a Grand

NO ENGINEEEING OBSTACLES.
There Might Be Some Dslay in Finan
ciering the Projectâ An Opinion â¢
of an Authority.
The project of connecting San Francisco
and Oakland by means of a bridge is
peculiarly fascinating. Commercially as
â¢well as socially it appeals to the popular ,
LINE OF PROPOSED GIGANTIC SUSPENSION BRIDGE TO CONNECT SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND. THE MAP SHOWS THE ROUTE AT PRESENT PROJECTED.
[From the design of Lyman Bridges, C. E.]
heart and little doubt exists that time will
see the project an accomplished fact.
Speaking of this matter yesterday Lyman j
Bridges, a civii engineer of note, in this !
locality, said:
â¢'A double track steel cantilever railway ;
bridge for standard and narrow gauge j
tracks between tlieeitiesof San Francisco ;
and Oakland and Alameda is practicable i
beyond question, and the benefits accruing j
therefrom between these, terminal cities in i
time saved for passengers and freight can !
hardly be overestimated.
"The profile of the ground line of San j
Francisco Bay from Folsom street, San i
Francisco (south of all the ferries), to tht*
nearest paint in Alameda south of the
narrow--gauge pier and mole, is entirely
practicable. The bridge will have eieven j
spans of 1000 feet, two spans of 700 feet,
ten spans of 500 feet and two draw or turn
bridges 250 feet each, with a center pier of
50 feet in width, giving a clear space of 100 i
feet on either side of the center pier and a !
mole two miles in length on the Alameda
side having. a width of 40 feet and 32 feet
in the clear on the grade line.
â¢'The mole will be level with the tQpof the
road -way of the bridge. The length of the 'â 
bridge will be three and a third miles and
the mole two miles in length. The bridge !
wi.i be of sufficient height to allow tug- ;
boats to pas 3 under arches between piers, j
The piers for the bridge will be white metal,
iron or steel cylinders twenty feet in
diameter, eight feet long, with cast flanges |
at either end. and bolted together after i
*ach section j.s tilled with concrete. Six
of thesÂ» cylinders will be p:aced at each <
pier and well braced and bonded together
at each section while in the caissons. At â 
the roadway at each pier strong steel cross j
beams will be bolted to the cylinders, and
Steel stringers upon which ties, rails and j
guard rails will be placed. ' â¢
â¢At the center pier> at the draw or turn !
bridges additional cylinders will be vlaced
for support and guards when the draws '
are opened.
â¢â¢These draw- bridges will have steam
engines on the top for openine and closing ;
rapidly, andjeiectric signals as well as flag
signals. It is estimated that they can be!
opened or cjosed in one minute.
â¢At New York the Kill yon Kull draw- j
bridge between Staten Island and New j
Jersey is 250 feet ;span with a 50-foot cen- j
ter pier, and the largest ships successfully j
pass witboutcompiaint from anybody. In ;
Chicago over 20,000 vessels annually pass '
in and out through a dozen draw or swing !
bridges, and commerce is benefited thereby \
because rail and sail are brought more I
closely toeether. For traffic over the great
railway bridge between Omaha and Coun
cil Bluffs they have a vestibule train with
open ends of cars, with four to ten cars in
a train: they drive teams or stocs
into one end of the train, and when a car I
is full of teams or stock close the doors, and '
at the destination at either side of the
Missouri River open, and drive out upon a
platform and inciin-e safely und quickly.
"At Ban Francisco an elevated road, , !
twenty-four feet above and across East ;
street, will bring the railway north along
the three blocks between Kast and Steuart
street? to Market street, simiiar to that of â 
the Pennsylvania Central Railway in the j
city of Philadelphia, at their city* passen- ;
ger ftation, and eventually connect with !
i-.a elevated railway up Market street. Also j
from Folsom and tast streets an elevated
road will swing to the south toward Harri- :
son and Spear or Bralo streets, and con- j
tinue to ttie Third* and Townsend-street j
station and China Basin und Illinois street,
thus connecting with all present lines of â¢
railways and the present licit Line Kail- ;
May in San Francisco.
â¢â¢This plan can be extended further by
securing- three or four blocks west of Steu
art and south of Market streets, if a con
centration of railways and fast freight and
fruit business couid be induced to have a
grand central station near the foot of
.Market street and principal ferries.
"At the Oakland' and Alameda end the
lines from the south end of the mole at
tlie juuttion with tne narrow-gauge rail
way can be built to a connection with
Railroad avenue and Prospect street for I
Alameda, and for Oakland from the south
end of the mole to and across Alice-street
railway bridge, which, with a curve from
the bridge to Madison street, in addition
to the present curve into First street,
would make a direct route for passenger
or freight traffic. In addition to the
above. For soutbern, through and subur
ban trains, local trains by First and
Seventh streets, and Port Costa and
Berkeley trains, can curve into and follow
Peralia street, across the estuary with a
drawbridge to the proposed mole, and all
train,- on either side of the bay of San
Francisco cross this much-needed bridge.
Think of crossing ihe bay and going to
Oakland in ten minutes, travelers and
tourists; of getting into your Puiiman
cars in San Francisco.
"Now is the time to act and plan for the
future, as well as for the preseut. The
San Francisco Terminal Company should
have this bridge built witnin the next rive
years."
DEPOSITORS AROUSED.
Victims of the People's Home Bank
Suspicious Over Attorney John
Flonrnoy's Removal.
The executive committee of the People's
Home Savings Bank depositors held a
meeting at 111 Sutter street last night.
The committee was thoroughly aroused
over the action of the board of directors of
the People's Home Bank in removing
John Flournoy as attorney. It decided to
call a mass-meetiug of the depositors at
Foresters Hall, 102 O'Farreli street, for
Friday evening.
At the close of the meeting T. S. Wil
liams Jr., secretary of the committee, said:
â¢Matters that seriously concern the de
positors will be discussed. A lively meet
ing is expected. Resolutions will be passed
expressing the opinions of the committee
and the depositors, and possibly some
other line of action may be mapped out.
Every depositor is invited to he present.
"M. H. Sherman and the stockholders'
interests are controlling the board of di
rectors. Mr. Flournoy commenced suits
of foreclosure against Sherman in Phoenix,
Axis., and also against the stockholders,
calling in the unpaid capital stock. These
interests removed him from the position !
of attorney so as to relieve them of his ,
asgressive" action. They could not use
Flournoy. 1 '
"And that is the reason why we are sus
spicious," added J. McCarthy, one of the
committea. "We are aroused. So long
as Mr. Flournov was there we knew they
could do no harm; but now that he is out,
we are suspicious, for we have no security
for our rights.
"The depositors' committee is going to
lay the matter before the Bank Commis
sioners, and, if need be, go to the Gov
ernor himself, though we are satisfied the
Commissioners will do their duty."
SHE HAS HEART FAILURE.
Mrs. Susan Martin Had a Faint-
ing Fit in the City Prison
Yesterday.
The Condition of Her Husband, John
F. Martin, Showed Much Im-
provement Last Night.
Mrs. Susan Martin, who shot her hus
band, John F. Martin, deputy County
Clerk, in the corridor of the City Hall
Monday morning, had a bad spell yester
day morning. She has been in a hysteri
cal state ever since her arrest, and yester
day morning she fainted. Dr. Bunnell,
assistant police surgeon, was sent for, and
Ned Foster, her orother-m-law, summoned
Dr. C. W. Card, the family physician, by
telephone.
The physician pronounced it a case of
heart failure, and it was some hours before
she rallied. Her sister, Mrs. Foster, who
has been constantly in attendance on her,
said last night that she was very much im
proved. She is constantly worrying her
self about her husband's condition and
anxiously inquires from her visitors as to
how he is. Mrs. Foster added that ever
since she began to worry about her hus
band's cruelty and neglect she has been
subject to these iainting spells.
Dr. Card said last night that Mrs. Mar
tin was simply suffering from an excess of
worry and excitement and there was noth
ing dangerous in her condition.
John F. Martin was slightly improved
last nieht. His temperature had decreased
from 102}^ Tuesday night to 100 last night,
and no unfavorable symptoms had pre
sented themselves. Peritonitis had not set
in, which Dr. Fitzgibbon said last night was
a hopeful sign. The doctor does not de
spair of pulling him through yet. Martin
expressed to the doctor a strong desire for
a big glass of steam beer, as he thought it
would do him good.
THE OREGON'S TRIAL TRIP.
Superintendent Scott Thinks It Likely
She Will Exceed Fifteen Kaola.
Superintendent John T. Scott of the
Union Iron Works when seen with regard
to the launching of the battle-ship Oregon
at the company's office near the works
yesterday afternoon made the following
statements:
"We intend to put the vessel on the dry
dock the latter part of this month, and it
will be from three to six weeks before she
is ready for sea. It is hard to tell the
exact time in a matter of this kind. We
don't know ourselves.
"As regards the speed of the vessel, she
will be required to make fifteen knots. I
am satisfied there will be no trouble on
this score."
"vVhat is your premium for a faster
rate?"
"Twenty-five thousand dollars for every
quarter of a knot."
"Do you expect to make a premium?"
"Weil, I don't know," was the cautious
reply. "Such a thing is possible- Yes, I
might as well say I am confident she will
exceed this rate, though how much I do
not care to say.
"The trial trip will be in Santa Barbara
Channel, where our preceding five trial
trips have taken place."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
FOUND A SECRET SHRINE
; Dr. Wolff's Remarkable Discov
ery in the Lofty Mountains
of Fiji.
, A TEMPLE CENTURIES OLD.
Meeting Place of a Mysterious Society
of Natives Inimical to the
Government.
Professor P. E. Wolff, the anthropologist,
of Berlin, who arrived here a day or two
j ago, says he has found in the mountains
j of Fiji a strange stone temple, the place
of meeting of an old secret society, cvi
: dently of native Masons.
As many as 70U natives have been able
; to meet there at a time, so large is the old
; temple.
It is a queer place in the mountain
! heights where the ancient temple was
built, and it shows, curiously enougi. as
i Dr. Wolff has learned, that centuries ago
i the people long known to us as bar
barians belonged to the secret order and j
I held their meetincs there. What is more, i
j the mountain Fijians who are members J
I yet hold their meetings there, and are very j
tenacious of the secrets of the order.
Dr. Wolff heard of the ancient temple
in a strange way through the Rev. Lori- I
mer Fison.whohad been a long time in
Fiji. The anthropologist, who had started
out on a tour of investigation in various
Pacific islands for the governments of
Germany, France and Spain, as well as the
Smithsonian Institution, determined he
would find out all about it if it took him
weeks and endangered his life.
He was pleased beyond measure that he
was at last able to locate the temple and
secure a large amount of accurate informa
tion regarding the wonderful and highly
mysterious societies.
"The secret shrine is in the heart of
Fiji," said Dr. "Wolff, "in what is known
Dr. P. E. Wolff, Who Found the Tem
ple, Centuries Old, of the Native
Masons in Interior Fiji.
[Sketched from life by a ''Call" artist.]
as Viti-Levu, or Big Fiji. It is a sacred
stone inclosure in the open air in the form
of a parallelogram, and with the walls
standing to a height of from four to five
feet. Surrounding the sacred temple are
a number of trees, which cast their re
freshing shadows over it.
"It was only after a great deal of effort
that I managed to get up into the moun
tains where it was; but I finally succeed
ed, and saw it with my own eyes. It took
me seven days to go twenty -six miles. I

the Strange Native Secret Society Have Met for Ages.
[From a sketch by Dr. Wolff.]
had seven men with me in all, and all
being natives who were acquainted some
what witn the country.
'â¢I started from the town of Dute-Walu
and paddled up the Navna River till we
got to a point nearly opposite the secret
shrine, and then we started across the
mountains. It was a slow and very diffi
cult task making our way through the
busb, and only by strong effort amid dis
couragements was the expedition able to
get throueh.
"I investigated the founding of the tem
ple, and from the best information I could
get 1 found that the secret society was
very old, as old as the Masons, and, as I
had every reason to believe, it was that
order itself. Probably the society was
founded during the trip of the Spanish
navigator Mendana, three centuries ago.
when he went from Pern. There is a
manuscript in Spain which tends to cor
roborate this. Mendana was a Mason.
Galego, the pilot of the fleet, tells that the
natives &hot at them with silver-tipped
arrows. The finding of the manuscript
was kept quiet for a long time.
"The natives of Fiji belonging to this
ancient order are inimical to the Govern
ment, and John Thurston, the Governor
of Fiji, has, as a matter of precaution, es
tablished a garrison in the district.
"The ancient temple, which is in the
form of a parallelogram, is divided into
three parts. The entrance Is for the first
degree members, or novitiates, and they
can get no further for four years. Then,
if they are deemed admissible they can go
a step further and take a second degree,
going into the second part. After four
years, il after the tests they are considered
sufficiently worthy, they are admitted into
the holy manga, which is a sacred inclos
ure entirely of stone, whose secrets can
only be known to those who have reached
the high conditions required."
Dr. Wolff considers the discovery of the
temple of signal importance in a scientific
way. He will deliver lectures about it at
Stanford and Berkeley universities. He
says t here are other places where members
of this strange native order have long
met, but none of them are so important as
this. In fact, the old temple is the only
structure of the kind vet discovered.
The discoverer will speak before the
Science Association of Berkeley University
on Thursday evening, April 9. The date
of the Stanford lecture is yet to be fixed.
T0 AID THE NEWSBOYS.
A Benefit to Be Given for the Powell-
Street Home.
A monster benefit will be given at the
Young Men's Christian Association on
Tuesday evening, the 21st inst., for the
benefit of the recently established News
boys' Home at 112 Powell street.
The home is making highly satisfactory
progress as far as the active interest of the
boys is concerned. The room where the
boys pat'her daily for their wholesome 5 or
10 cent meals is crowded by the young
caper venders and yesterday afternoon
eighteen of them enjoyed the bathing
privileges for the first time furnished by
the home.
Singing classes and classes for evening
study will be organized shortly and some
benevolent ladies are arranging to provide
cots and bedclothing for the boys who
want a clean but cheap lodging.
An organization of the boys under 15
years of age has been formed for the pur
suit of profitable and pleasing exercises,
among the most popular being a military
drill. The officers are: John McKeever,
president; Thomas Smith, vice-presi
dent; Abe Harris. vice-president;
John Williams, secretary; Charles
Nelsun, assistant secretary; James Kel
lece, sergeant-at-arms; Tn'omas Kennedy,
assistant sergeant-at-arms. The club
meets every Saturday evening. The older
boys, whose organization has not yet been
perfected, hold their weekly meetings on
Thursday evening.
A restaurant for the public, distinct
from the newsboys' dining-room, has been
onened, in the hope that it may serve to
at least partially support the institution.
THE POLICE TRIBUNAL.
Two Patrolmen Dltmliied From the
Force and Two Fined.
The Police Commissioners were occupied
several hours last night in hearing the evi
dence on charges against four patrolmen,
and two of them were dismissed from the
force.
William Qilheany, who conducted him
self in a peculiar manner by scaring the
women on Berry street, was one of the
two dismissed, and John Fanning was the
other. Fanning, who is an old officer, had
two charges against him, one of being in
toxicated when he should have been on
duty and the other not reporting for doty.
John Kenville for slapping a boy in the
Mission on the face was fined $50, and
John W. Durkiti for not patrolling his
beat was fined $25.
The Evolution of Happlnens.
Professor Henry Huntington Powers de
livered a lecture last evening at the Academy
of Sciences on "The Evolution of Happiness."
His lecture was the second of the present series
of discourses given unde* the auspices of the
Stanford University Extension Ciub of this
City.
Professor Powers held that when man had
learned the art of changing "things into
goods"â dislributing wealth and acquiring
property, works of art, etc.â he had not learned
happiness. This was only the beginning of
the proces.9 of evolution of happiness. The
error of the whole human race was mat man
could not get some goodâ some satisfact.on
from goods. The full measure of happiness
was obtainable only through a collective or co
ordinate enjoyment. Tne sounds of nature
were dreary and monotonous. Even the most
melodious sounds â the songs of birds â were
exceedingly simple. They don't give per
manent satisfaction. Primitive man used his
ears to detect sounds of nature; civilized man
wants variety and haa developed music, with
possibilities of pleasure measured only by the
power to comprehend.
BOSS PAINTERS
DECIDE TO FIGHT
Masters' Association Will
Bitterly Combat the
Union's Card.
THEIR CASTIRON FLEDGE
To Issue a List of Those Who
Refuse to Unionize Their
Shops.
THE WORKING CARD IN FORCE.
It Was Favorably Accepted Yesterday
by Contractors All Over the
City.
The Master Painters' Association held
an important meeting last night and de
cided to fight the Building Trades Coun
cil's working-card system so far as it
applies to the Painters' and Decorators'
Union. About forty new members joined
the association and accepted the pledge
to fight the union jonrneymen to the bitter
end.
The Painters' Union is rejoicing over
the fact that St. Denis <fc Co. have union
ized their shop. Work will be begun by
this rirrn on the Parrott building very
soon.
The working card of the Allied Building
Trades went into effect yesterday, and re
ports were made that it was well received
by the contractors. No walkouts were
ordered under the new system, but in sev
eral instances non-union men were com
pelled to quit work.
BOSSES WILL FIGHT.
The Master Painters Are Pledged
to Resist the Union
Card System.
From the developments at the meeting
of the Master Painters' and Decorators' |
Association last night at the Builders' j
Exchange there is to be a most determined !
and aggressive stand taken by the mem- 'â 
bers of that association against the card '
system, put into practice yesterday by the
painters and the other affiliated unions of
the Building Trades Council.
It was learned for the first time yester
day that about a month ago a resolution
was adopted pledging every member of
the association to resist individually and
jointly the introduction of the card
system.
At the meeting last night among tne !
subjects discussed was the reported j
recalcitrancy of some of the mem- I
bers of the association, and at the
conclusion of the session, which lasted for
nearly four hours and was not over until
near midnight, it was announced that not
a single member had agreed to concede to j
the demands of the striking painters.
When the instance of St. Dems & Co.,
who are painting in the Parrott building,
was cited as a case wherein the painters I
had won a victory, it was stated that this
arm's adhesion to the card system was
but temporary in all probability and in
: duced simply by the fear that the present
! profitable job on the Parrott buiJding
might r.ot be lost. No member of the firm
was present at the meeting, so the state
ments made in explanation of the action
of tne firm were really based on surmises
only.
It was claimed by the painters yesterday
that M. J. Donovan had agreed to recog
nize the card system, but at the meeting he
denied that he had made such a conces
sion.
Forty-two new members were added to
the association list, nearly doubling the
membership, which is now close to 100.
Those who joined last night had been sent
special letters of invitation to do so. In
furtherance of the policy to further con
solidate the bosses it was decided to retain
the reduced initiation fee of $2 50 for sixty
days in order to encourage new applica
tions for membership. At the end of this
period the iniation will be advanced to $25.
So strongly wrought up were the mem
bers by the reports that the pledee against
the card system had been violated by
various firms that it was decided to put
every member on record on this subject by
i having the firm or individual sign the
pledge. Copies of this will then be
published.
ST. DENIS* POSITION.
The Union Painters Do Not Believe
He Wiil Betray Their Con
fidence.
The position taken by J. St. Denis and
bis partner, Mr. Macauley, in settling their
differences with the Painters' Union, was
assailed yesterday by several of the em
ploying painters. Tf*yr said that St. Denis
& Co. only made terms with the union
painters in order to complete several big
time contract jobs they have on hand and
that the firm will break its compact with
the union as soon as the urgent work on
hand is finished. They contended that
pressure was brought to bear on St. Denis
& Co. by the Parrott estate, and that the
contractors were obliged to get men on
any terms.
These remarks were repeated to several
prominent members of the Building Trades
and Painters' Union, whereupon one made
the following answer:
Ido not believe it. St. Denis <fc Co. came out
openly and fought the union like men. They
met the arbitration committee like men and
made an agreement like men . It is not at all
likely that they will act in any but a manly
manner in keeping their word "of honor, and
the person who fights you like a man will never
stab you in the back: like a savage after pro
claiming peace.
FAVOR ARBITRATION.
The Building Trades Council's Rep-
resentatlves Will Call Upon
P. N. Kuss To-Day.
The building trade 3 people are well
satisfied so far as can be learned with thÂ«
success of its grievance or arbitration com
mittee in securing for the striking painters
a settlement with J. St. Denis & Co.. so
that the latter's shop is now unionized.
The work in this line will not stop.
It is the belief that nearly every
employing painter in the City can be in
duced to make terms with the Painters'
Union, so that further trouble may be
avoided. If so, they reason that such a
course is far better than prolonging or in
creasing the present difficulties.
This morning H. It. Saundera and J.
McCartney of the Buildine Trades Coun
cil will call upon P. N. Kuss, the painter
who has held out so firmly against the
Painters' Union. Tnev wi!l do all in their
power to induce him to settle the present
trouble by arbitration, the same as St.
Denis & Co. They claim that the mission
of the council is to settle differences peac
abiy instead of by radical measures. Other
employing painters will be called upon as
soon as possible.
NO MEN CALLED OUT.
The Walking Delegates of the Build
ing Trades Council Met With
No Opposition.
According to ample notice previously
given by all the unions affiliated with the
Building Trades Council the card system
went into effect yesterday. This signified
that contractors for all kinds of buildings
and for all work done by the craftsmen of
unions affiliated with the Building Trades
Council were to employ no man except
such as could show a properly certified
card from his union declaring him to be in
good standing. Failure to restrict the
torce of men employed to the holders of
union cards is to be met with the calling
out of all union men employed on the
same building or job.
So far as calling out men or precipitat
ing a strike is concerned, the work of H.
M. Saunders and R. T. Mclvor, the walk
ing delegates appointed by the Building
Trades Council to bring about the exclu
sive employment of union men on all jobs
now in progress in the City, was barren of
results. But the intelligent and conserva
tive course of these two men yesterday
undoubtedly strengthened the cause of the
union men directly interested in this con
test, as well as labor unionism generally.
They found non-union men, it is true,
working in some cases with union men,
but where the bosses promised future com
pliance with the demands of the unions â
the recognition of the card Bystemâcon
cessions were made and work was allowed
to continue uninterruptedly.
Both Mclvor and Saunders started out
early in the morning to investigate all re
; ported cases where non-union men were
j employed with union men. On the build
' ing in course of alteration at the corner of
First and Market streets, it was reported
that several non-union lathers were being
em ployed by Chris Morehouse. A visit to
the place snowed , however, that the non
| union men had been laid off, owine to the
refusal of the union carpenters and union
plasterers to work with them. The latter
assured Saunders that if any attempt was
i made to put on any non-union men they
j would all walk out "without further notice.
A three-story bay-window house is in
j course of erection on Post street, just east
I of Larkin, under a contract witn James
I Logan. Here fifteen non-union lathers
I were at work, as the result of the recent
) lathers' striKe. Mr. Logan has always
j shown a most friendly spirit toward the
unions, and his representation that the
lathers would complete their task by
night and his promise that in all future
jobs be would recognize the card system,
j Fiis forceâ union and non-union menâ was
left undisturbed.
At Fourth and Welsh streets it was
| found that all the employes were union
: men, though it had been reported other
j wise.
At tne Parrott building the men had
! the most difficult problem to solve.
i As already announced in The Call, Si.
I Denis <fc Co. had agreed to recognize
I the card system and unionize their whole
force. This they did. The committee
found, however, three non-union men do
ing some polishing work for P. V. Kuss,
one of the boas painters arrayed against
, the card system. This was at first consid
i ered sutlicient cause to call off the several '
j hundred union men employed on the I
I building.
But a further investigation of the mai-
I ter showed that this work was not being ,
! done on the building proper nor under
| contract with the Parrott estate. It was
finishing work on some fixtures for one of
the intending tenants, who had contracted i
for it. Kuss refused to discharge and re- j
place them with union men, and thus the j
matter stands.
This action of the committee was at

first considered to be showing too great
leniency to the Parrott building contract
ors, but when it became known that the
Kuss job was entirely apart from the woik
on the building, the good sense and care
full judgment of the committee wai gen
erally approved.
Mrs. Blakeney. the lady who has been a
year engaged in raisiDg her house at 322
Ellis street and adding a basement to it,
was found to be employing non-union
help, but it was found impossible by either
member of the committee to get within
arguing distance of the lady-afraid-01-con
tractors-and-unions.
Several other places were visited, but
for various reasons it was oleeided to defer
definite action for a day or two. The work
of "unionizing" all building jobs will be
continued tonlay.
PLUMBERS IN LINE.
They Pass Resolutions of Sympathy
and Decide to Affiliate With
the Council.
Significant and important action was
taken at the meeting of the Journeymen
Plumbers' ana Gastitters' Union last night
at the Alcazar building. Resolutions of
sympathy with the striking painters were
passed and the hope was expressed that
the card-system would win, as the
plumbers of this City had been most suc
cessfully working under that system for
the past fourteen years.
Their expression of sympathy was fol
lowed by something more suDstantial.
however. A committee of three was an.
pointed to arrange for ti:e affiliation of the
union with the Building Trades Council.
The import of this may be gathered from
the fact that the plumbers constitute one
of the most influential unions in the City,
and have never had occasion to come to
an ovort issue with employers or contract
ors. Ihe amalgamation of this union,
which is a branch of the United Associa
tion of Plumbers and Gasfitters of the
United State* and Canada, with the Build
ing Trades Council will give hoth added
strength and prestige to the council.
THE DISTRICT COUNCIL.
The Bulldlnar Trades' Working-Card
System Reported to Bo Well
Received by Contractors.
A short session of the District Council
of Carpenters and Joiners was held last
evening. Business Agent H. M. Saun
ders made a long report upon the recep
tion of the working card. He said that
none of the building contractors manifest
any opposition to the card. In several in
stances the non-union men left the jobs or
were ordered by the bosses to quit work.
Several mixed jobs were found, but they
will be at once straightened out without
the necessity of a strike or a call-out ot
the union workmen. His discretion in
these matter received the approval of the
delegates.
THE DERRICK WORKERS.
The spirit of organization among the.
laboring men seems to be spreading. The
derrick workers will soon form a union,
and the character of their work will per
mit them sending delegates to the Build
ing Trades Council. In this City there
are upward of a hundred men who make
a living by derrick work, and their pres
ence is always observed around the *iew
stone and iron buildings. The handling
of biÂ£ slabs of stone and iron girders and
beams is a trade by itself and ordinary
laborers are unable to perform this char
acter of work.
Mr. McCartney, a delegate to the Build
ing Trades Council, has been among the
derrick workers recently with a view of
organizing the men of that craft. A num
ber have promised to call a meeting at an
early date, and if a sutlicient number can
be obtained, form a union. Among the
first efforts such a union would put forth
would be the regulation of hours of labor,
a minimum wage and a demand for the
recognition of their union.

OVER DISEASE
Dr. Ellinwood Performs a
Wonderful Surgical
Operation.
WITHOUT A PARALLEL.
Cancerous Growth Successfully
Removed by Clever
Means.
MURPHY BUTTON IS LOST.
The Cathode Ray Will Probably Be
Employed to Locate the Missing
Article.
The medical world of San Francisco is
directing its attention toward a surgical
operation recently performed by Dr. Ellin
wood at the City and County Hospital.
In many respects it is the most remarK
able of modern surgical accomplishments,
and with perhaps half a dozen exceptions
i- without a parallel in the history of med
ical science.
On January 14 last Mrs. Lizzie Tschech,
the wife of a laborer living at 444 Union
street, was carried to the County Hospital.
The nature of her ailment was unknown
at that time, but it was plainly evident
that she was a very sick womanâ ?ick unto
death in fact, unless speedily afforded re
lief. She was pale, emaciated and utterly
unable to retain any food on her stomach.
It was only a matter of days when the
woman would die of starvation if the un
known disease did not lirst rinish its
deadly work.
Dr. Ellinwood was finally asked to diag
nose the case, and to him the woman is
indebted for her earthly existence to-day.
Carefully and with that leisure incident to
the profession when doubt exists the phy
sician made his examination. At the end
of the pbdomen he discovered a hard,
lumpy substance â carcinoma is the medi
cal tÂ«rm, and means a cancerous tumor.
Mrs. Tschech and her husband were in
formed that unless an operation were per
formed her life must soon pay the forfeit
demanded by the insidious disease. Even
should the knife be resorted to there was
no guarantee of success â first, because the
disease had been allowed to run a long
timd and cures of this particular
nnd peculiarly located trouble were ex
ceedingly rare.
The wife and husband consulted long
and earnestly together. There was one
chance for life in tiie operation proposed, j
If it failed then it would only hasten the
relief from the living death the woman
-was then suffering. Mrs. Tsoheoh would
trasp the hope held out by Dr. Ellinwood,
because anything was better than her con
dition at that time.
On January 30 the woman, pale, emaci
ated and scarcely able to raise her head,
was laid on the operating table in ward G
Â»Â»f the County Hospital. Dr. Ellinwood,
;i misled by Drs. Rixford and Stillman, ap
plied themselves willingly but by no
means fearlessly to the task.
An incision wa3 made at a point just
above where the tumor lay. The foreign
growth, with its insidious arms and
prong*, was found.
To remove the growth was a matter of
easy moment, but how to repair the gap
of three or four inches was altogether an
other matter. What is know as the
"Murphy button" â an ingenious surgical
device used with success in the Paris hos
pitalsâoffered the only possible way out
of the difficulty, and the operating sur
geons took advantage of the chance.
The operation was performed. For
hours the woman lay in a semi-conscious
condition, and then she began to improve
rapidly. During the first four or five days
what nourishment she received was ob- |
tamed by absorption. After that time she I
found ;* easy to take milk and light dift
in the natural way, and for the last four
weeks has been eating all kinds of solids.
To-day Mrs. Tschech is able to walk any
reasonable distance, and the only thing
preventing her discharge from the hospi
tal is the Murphy button which saved her
life.
This little scientific device is so arranged
as to cut itself loose from its environments
at the end of a week or ten days. It is now
two months since the button was put in
:he anatomy of Mrs. Tschech to do its
work, and in spite of all precedent it per
sists in remaining there. It is this fact
which now troubles Dr. Ellinwood and his
assistants.
There is no doubt about the success of
the operation, the woman's condition
to-day showing that she-is aa healthy and
sound as ever.
Dr. Ellinwood has about determined
that there is only one thing to do, and
that is to turn on the cathode ray. Unless
the button manifests its whereabouts dur
ing the next week ho will employ the new
discovery in the hope ot learning its pres
ent abiding place.

UÂ«ed a Potato-Masher.
John Ivanvich, waiter in a restaurant at 507

afternoon for assaulting B. McCullough wiih a
potato-masher. He preferred a counter charge
of assault against MeCullough, who had been
ejected from the restaurant for using abusive
language and refusing to pay for his meal. He
returned to the place and was met by Ivanvich
at the door, and the restaurater hit him on the
head with the masher. Again MeCullough re
turned and proceeded to throw dishes at Iyan

Ivanvich got through using the masher MeCul
lough was a fit subject for the Receiving Hos

CITY HALL DIRECTORY.
Peace Between the Merchants and the
City Hall Commissioners.
Peace now reigns between the City Hall
Commissioners and the Merchants' Asso
ciation. The vexed question of a floor
directory for the new City Hall, which has
latterly evoked some spirited corre
spondence between the two bodies of
gentlemen, seems now in a fair way
to be set at rest. Assistant Secretary
Keckeit of the City Hall Commission
waited upon the Merchants' Association
yesterday with a special message from the
Commissioners, to the effect that they
would be glad to meet the directors of the
association for the purpose of arranging a
satisfactory solution of the directory
matter. The conference will take place
next Tuesday morning at the regular
meeting of the Commissioners, and it be
gins to look as though visitors to the new
City Hall would soon cease to feel like
babes in the wood when they visit that
labyrinthine structure.

THE FOUR PUPILS WHO WILL REPRESENT THE SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOLS IN THE DEBATE.
HIS SKULL FRACTURED
James Johnson, an Ex-Convict,
Dies at the Receiving
Hospital.
Hugh Smith, a Young Teamster, Is
Arrested and Charged With
Manslaughter.
James Johnson, an ex-convict 35 years
of age, died at the Receiving Hospital yes
terday morning, and his body was taken
to the Morgue where an inquest will be
held. In connection witli his death, Hugh
Smith, a teamster living at 21 Hunt street,
was arrested yesterday by Po;icemen T. L.
Ryan and Tuite, and was booked at the
City Prison on a charge of manslaughter.
Johnson and a woman named Lizzie
Johnson, with whom he had been living
at 31 Hunt street, were arrested on Sun
aay morning on suspicion of having stolen
a gold watch from John Smith in the Oak
land House on Third and Howard streets.
Johnson seemed to be very drunk at the
time of his arrest, and as he had a wound
in his scalp he was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where his wound was dressed
iby Dr. Rinne. He was then taken to the
| t'itv Prison.
On Tuesday morning he appeared to be
suffering from delirium tremens, and he
was sent back to the hospital where he
died yesterday morning. Then it was dis
covered that his skull had been fractured,
and Policemen Ryan and Tuite were de
tailed to make an investigation as to how
Johnson sustained the fracture of the
skull.
The officers went to Hunt street, and the
first one they a?ked was Hugh Smith, the
young teamster. Smith at once admitted
that he had a fight with a man answering
jonnson's description on Sunday morn
ing, and when taken to the Morgue he at
once identified Johnson as the man.
"My attention was called to two men
fighting on the corner of Third and Hunt
streets," said Smith, "by my mother's
screams. I saw a big man beating an old
man, and Ir an up to them and told the
big man he ought to be ashamed of him
self lor beating such an old man. The big
man made a swipe at me and I struck him
twice in the face., knocking him against the
wall. He fell to the ground, his head
striking hard on the pavement. I thought
nothing more about it and went back
home."
The police are searching for the old man
Johnson was beating. They have learned
that he was urging Johnson to return the
watch to John Smith, who had been
robbed in the Oakland House, when John
son struck him.
Hugh Smith is a respectable young man
and was married a few months ago. John
son got twelve years for burglary in 1885,
and two months ago he was arrested for
vagrancy and having burglars' tools in his
possession.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
WHICH CITY CAN TALK?
Great Inter-High School Debate
to Take Place This
Month.
SAN FRANCISCO VS. OAKLAND.
Lowell and Oakland High Schools to
Be Pitted Against Each Other
in Oratory.
An event which is attracting great in
terest in Sau Francisco and Oakland edu
cational and social circles ia the inter
high school debate which is to take place
in Oakland on the 24th inst. The Lowell
High School of this City and the Oakland
High School are to be pitted against each
other in an oratorical controversy.
Never before in the history of these
schools has such a contest taken place.
They have always been rivals for athletic
honors, but this will be a new departure.
The subject to be discussed is: "Re
solved, That the substitution of a re
sponsible Ministry for the President's
Cabinet would be beneficial to the United
States Government."
Oakland is to espouse the affirmative
side, while San Francisco will argue for .
the negative.
The Lowell High School Debating So
ciety has chosen its speakers. Its cham- ;
pions are J. C. Colman, Aaron H. Brown
and J. Frank English. Otto H. Hahn is
the substitute, and has been giving the
young men very valuable assistance in
their preparations. Mr. Clark, head of the j
history department at the Lowell High !
School, has taken a great interest in this
contest, rendering the chosen speakers
invaluable aid. Mr. Morton, principal,
and Mr. Kellogg, head of the English de- i
partuent, are also striving to bring the ,
honors of victory to San Francisco.
The Lowell High School Debatiner So
ciety has been in existence for a little over
a year, and it can well be proud of its rec
ord. It is the most sucoesÃful of all the i
movements that have been taken at this ;
school to band the students in closer re
lationship to one another. The Oakland
High School will choose its debaters from i
the following list: Bertram Reynolds, '
Archie J. Cloud, Harry F. Keeler, Fred G. j
Dorety and Charles Inagle.
The date of this lirst inter-high school '
debate is awaited with great interest by j
the students and faculty of the schools.
CUSTOM-HOUSE BATTLE
A Special Agent Was in the
City Unknown to Moore
and Wise.
Came to Gather Information About
the Scandals in the Collector's
Office.
A special agent of the treasury from
Washington has been in this City, making
a secret investigation of the Wise-Moore
controversy.
There are all sorts of rumors flying about
the Custom-house in regard to the battle
between Collector of the Port Wise and
Special Agent Moore of the Treasury De
partment. One day the Collector seems to
j have won a significant victory and the
i next the special agent apparently has a
| slight advantage. This panorama of events,
! these stereopticon views of official life in
the Government Bervice, has furnished
plenty of entertainment for those whose
duties call them daily to the big brown
buildinz on Battery street.
To those acquainted with the situation
and who are particularly interested in the
outcome the antagonism between the two
j officials of the Government is one of more
than paseing concern. It means the dis
missal of certain subordinates under the
Collector of the Port or the removal of
Major Moore from the San Francisco
agency. Moore has been sixteen years in
the service and he has always stood well
I with the department in whose immediate
charge he is. But his enemies want to see
him go down before tbe onslaught that
Wise is making uoon him. Complaints
have been maae against him to the Wash-
I ington authorities, strong pressure has
been brought against him by the political
colleagues of Wise, and even the Chinese
witnesses, whose evidence he mostly relied
upon, have become unknown quantities.
Officers have been seeking them every
where, but they cannot be found. Moore
eharees his enemies with influencing their
absence.
Secretary Carlisle is evidently at a loss
how to deal with Ihe Wise-Moore affair.
He has had a special agent Here for several
weeks studying the situation. Upon his
report the final decision will depend. This
officer quietly dropped into town some
three weeks ago. He gathered all the in
formation he coula on the issue and dis
appeared as quietly as he came. He has
returned direct to Washington and will
place his report in the hands of the Secre
tary of the Treasury. What this report
contains no person knows but the Secre
tary and the agent himself. Neither
Major Moore nor Collector Wise was con
sulted by the airent, ana it is a question if
they even knew of his presence in the
City.
STREET SPRINKLING.
A Conference This Afternoon in the
Mills Building.
This afternoon at 2:30 o'clock a public
meeting under the auspices of the Mer
chants' Association will be held in the
assembly-room of the Mills building, when
the matter of street sprinkling will come
up for discussion. Members of the asso
ciation have for some time displayed
their zeal in their efforts to secure a re
form in this department.
Under the present regime a number of
private individuals seem to control the
street sweeping and sprinkling work.
These men have been invited to the meet
ing, and it is hoped that by conferring
with the directors tney may be induced to
act in harmony with them for the realiza
tion of the schemes of reform advocated
by the association.
JUMBLED HISTORY.
Denis Gore's Estate Unearths Some
Matrimonial Tangles.
The settling of the estate of Denis Gore
before Judge Slack has so far developed
a peculiar matrimonial tangle. Gore's
heirs are rather uncertain, and for that
reason the children of his sister, a Mrs.
McLaughlin, may have some trouble in
securing the estate to which they have
laid claim.
Gore was married in Ireland. He lived
with bis wife but a short time, and then
left suddenly for America. Soon after his
departure two children were born to bis
wife.
It was found after the investigation was
a snort time in progress that not only bad
Gore left a wife and family in Ireland, but
that Mrs. Gore had come to America after
despairing of her husband's return, and
had married again in this City. Gore and
his wife had actually lived in San Fran
cisco, and neither knew of the existence of
the other. Gore's children in Ireland are
claiming the estate, which is worth about
$7500.
HIS MARRIAGE A FAILURE
Frank Healy Sails for Tahiti
After a Four Days'
Honeymoon.
His Bride Was Left Behind and May
Never Again See Her Young
Groom.
The honeymoon of Frank Healy and his
bride was cut short yesterday in the most
unexpected manner possible when the
barkentine Tropic Bird sailed out of port
for the South Seas.
Young Kealy was a passenger on the
Tropic Bird, and the few friends who saw
him off wondered why he went away
alone. It was quite apparent that the
youthful wife had been deserted, but what
became of her was another story.
A laconic conversation with one of
Healy 'm companions threw some iight on
the latest develypn Â°nt of the little ro
mance of a few days' duration.
"I've bought my ticket, and I've $2 50
left," the youth remarked with an air of
bravado, though it might be noticed that
his voice was linged with regret. We was
not like himself as he stood there ready to
leave his home behind. His marriage was
held to have been a folly, an escapade, and
upon recovering sober second thoughts he
was oppressed with an overpowering sense
of error.
"And where are you going?"
"Tahiti."
"Going to take your wife along?"
"Not by a sight."
"Why uid you marry her, then?"
"1 was drunk."
The young man upon whom life became
a burden after four days shook hands with
his chum.
"Tell all the boys good-by, and â so long,
old man," were his last words as he fled.
Healy is a son of Captain M. A. Healv
of the revenue cutter Bear, and a lawyer
by profesHon in the office of Henley &
Costello on Sansome Btreet.
Saturday last he went to the City Hall
and procured a marriage license to weti
Miss Lucretia M. Carpenter. He gave the
age of himself as 25 and that of his bride as
21 years. His friends say he was on a
spree at the time, and both the bride and
groom were denied admittance to the
apartments of nis family in the Occidental
Hotel.
"What will he do in Tahiti?" his com
panion was asked.
"Own the town, I guess."

WATCHING DIPHTHERIA.
The Board of Health Will Check
the Spread of the
Disease.
DE. SPENCER'S PROPOSITION.
Hog Ranches May Be Moved in Sixty
Days if There Is No Legal
Obstacle.
The increasing number of cases of diph
theria that are reported from day to day
has warned the Board of Health that the
season for the dread disease is approach
ing, and action was taken at yesterday's
special meeting looking to an effectual
check to its spread.
Dr. Spencer, the City bacteriologist,
stated that it would be an easy matter to
diagnose suspected cases and determine
whether or not it is genuine diphtheria by
rubbing a wad of cotton across the mouth
of the patient, and then subjecting the
cotton to heat, to see whether colonies of
the diphtheria bacilli would grow. He
proposed that physicians be required to
notify him of suspected cases, so that he
could investigate. He thought that by
this means the spead of the disease could
be checked and at the same time much
anxiety and expense saved to the parents
of those children who proved to be free
from the disease. Drs. Morse and Wil
liamson were appointed a committee to
investigate the preposition and report at
the next meeting of the board.
A number of communications relative to
the prevalence of diphtheria in certain
sections of the City were received and
placed on file, pending the report of the
committee.
The board decided that in case its legal
adviser would declare its action to be
legal it would take immediate steps to re
move the hog ranches, of which the resi
dents of the Bay View, Excelsior and
Spring Valley homesteads have been com
plaining.
Health Officer Lovelace made a formal
report setting forth that the Board of
Supervisors had failed to act on the re
quest of the health authorities to have the
hog limits extended, in soite of the fact
that they had been shown that the ranches
were a menace to the public health.
Dr. Morse expressed the opinion that
the board had a perfect right to remove
the ranches, by condemning them, and
moved that they be declared nuisances
and ordered closed within Bixty days,
formal notice to be served forthwith on "all
of the owners.
Mayor Sutro counseled caution, saying
that the board should be certain of its
legal rights and should not do anything
appearing to be in defiance to the Board
of Supervisors without being sure of its
ground.
It was determined to postpone action
for one week and to instruct the legal ad
viser of the board, Denis Spencer, to pre
pare an opinion on the matter in the
'. meantime and present it at the next meet;
-; ing of the board.
Frederic Leighton's peerage was the
shortest lived in the history of England.
He died on the day following that upon
which the patent of nobility was issued,
and as he left no heir the title died with
him.
Base-coiners are dealt with very severely
in Japan. Some time ago a man named
Takujaro, living at Tokio, was sentenced
to six years' hard labor for uttering a
false coin.

WILL LANIGAN
BECOME A BOSS?
The Junta Anti-Raineyites
Take Him Up to
Make Him.
A CHANCE TO BEAT SAM.
McNab Works a Combination to
Defeat Rainey and Boost
Lanigan.
WELBURN IS IN THE DEAL. ,
The New Boss Is Given Practical Con
trol of the Junta and New
Hopes Run High.
There Is a new Democratic boss in town.
At least they are making nimâ Gavin Mc-
Nab and the rest of the anti-Rainey Junta
of the anti-Buckley Junta.
It's Kd Linigan. There has just been i
completed an elaborate compact and plan I
EDWARD IAMGAN, WHO li CUT OIT FOR THE NEW BOS.-, OI THE JUNTA
which is to bring into play in the local I
Democratic field of practical politics a
new and (jilite interesting force, and Ed
Lanigan is to play it as it ought to be
played.
The idea. is to boost Mr. Lanigan into the
position of "the" Democratic boss of San
Francisco, which position is to be attained j
when the "decent eiernent" of the Junta j
has driven Chris Buckley und Sam Rainey ;
into the last sewer, destroyed "bossism" 1
and thoroughly disinfected the iiartv. If
the Junta wins LanigÂ«n 13 to be hailed as
king. .
Of course this merely describes the pres
ent good intentions" of certain people.)
Political schemes, bin and little, are
mightily uncertain, ana we'll havf- to wait
to see whether this BCJieme will end like a
tizz, or whether there- comes a Laaiean, a
liriL'ht star of a new Democratic destiny,
who is to wind up the nistoric careers -of i
Chris Buckley ami Sam Rainey as Buck- :
ley. rising a? Lanigan now rises, chased
Mannix and Bnwly into oblivion.
This brilliant scheme is the last resort of
the anti-Rainey portion of the Junta, and
by it they figure on snatching the organ
ization from Rainey 's very claws and on;
giving him the iickirit: that he was going |
to give theni. As Kainey lias the organ- :
izatiun within his grasp something Na
poleonic was necessary- Now there will
be a hot fight between the Raineyites and I
the Laniganese. and one of tbe sides will j
capture the works. Gavin McNab pre
dicts that in a lew weeks all the Demo-
Crafts in San Francisco will be thronging
the local dancing academies in their j
eagerness to be "learning a step for Lanl- j
gan's ball.'.'
Tbe recoliection of a little recent history !
is necessary to ' understand the situation, i
Early last October Gavin McNab saw some j
moccasin tracks around town. He recog- I
nized tnem.as he used to walk in the same â 
kind, and he knew that Chris Buckjey was |
quietly gathering in the old Democratic I
general committee of 4.VJ, which was
elected in 1390 by the anti-3uckley re
organizers. McNab managed to hustle to- I
gether some forces before Buckley was
through, and Buckley was beaten by the |
elecriori of A.. A. "Watkina to the vacant I
chairmanship by a vote of 184 to 154. |
Buckley didn't. quit, and at the next meet- j
ing, a short time afterward, Buckley had
a small majority. It was at that exciting
liieeting that the defeated McNab element
turtifd out the iras, made, off with the roll
and tried to effect an adjournment sine
die by trickery. They withdrew and left!
Buckley in possession of the. majority. In j
the meantime a new general committee |
had been. aptrointed by that committee of j
liity, and this new committee, arbitrarily j
ruled by McNab and \\\ P. Sullivan, be"-'
canie an independent organization.
The force-ithat McNab was able to get
and hold topether through these events
were, first, Rainey and the Fire Depart
ment; teoQnd, Daggett. who was politi
cally .associated with Rainey; third, Col
lector of Internal' Revenue Weibarn, and i
fourth, scattering anti-B::ckleyites, inclua- !
ing Max Popner. Sam . Braunnart, et al. I
McNab was personally and politically
friendly and influential with these forces, j
Lanigan was included in Welburn'a i
strength, as he is a deputy in that office, j
These three men-^-Daggett. Rainey and
Welourn â wielded their power, of course,
through patronage. It was the force of
jobs held by members of the committee or
their friends that gave effect to the orders
to stand against Buckley.
The combination from the start was a
heterogeneous and discordant one. The
movement was declared to be one to down
Bockleyism, bossism and corruption in
the party and in favor of "decency and
parity." Yet they pressed Sam Rainey to
their bosoms. The inconsistency was ex
plained by sayincr, "Oh, we are using
Rainey for a purpose, and when the time
comes we'll dump him," and there were
many in the Junta really as hostile to
Rainey as to Buckley. Daggett was doing
bosa politics through Mint politics, if boÂ«s
politics were ever done, and the organiza
j tion, like tlie whole party, was full of bit
i ter enemies of John Daggett. There were
otiicr political enmities of all sorts.
Then from the start there has been
trouble about the apportionment of power
i among the big forces, and in the recent
past Lanigan has had some heavy kicks.
A few week 3 ago there came the outward
semblance of a primary for the election of
a new general committee, and then began
the war with Rainey. The time had come
I to "dump" Rainey ,'but Rainey would not
play that. He had closely combined his
interests with Daggett, and the Fire De
partment and the Mint made every effort
to increase their strength in the Junta
general committee. Especial efforts have
been made since the organization got the
prestige of recognition by the State Cen
tral Committee, and Mint jobs have been
given right and left to people of influence
in the committee, Jiut the organization
has been officered and committeed by anti-
Raineyites, and the "inside" is hard to
beat.
At the alleged primary but one ticket
was allowed in a district. These tickets
were arbitrarily made up at headquarters,
and the number of delegates allowed to
Rainey and Daggett people were carefully
dealt " out according to "expediency."
Rainey and Daggett would have got an
overwhelming majority at a fair, open
primary, but they were firmly repressed
amid constant rowing.
Two weeks ago it became evident that
Rainey and Daggett bad practical control
of the committee, as far as votes went,
though they were handicapped by the "in
side" having the "works." Within a short
time after the primary Rainey had taken
into camp many members, -who had been
allowed to go oh the ticket on the supposi
tion that they were safely anti-Rainey, and
the Rainey-Daggett workers are hard at it j
yet with every pull that can be brought to ;
bear.
Rainev's strength (including Daggett's)
is now 170 at a conservative estimate, with
a possible 190 votes. As these delegates
would all be at a meeting, while a lot of j
0 hers wouldn't. Kainey could likely run
any meeting of the general committee and
carry through a programme. So the anti-
Raineyites have seen Rairiey on the verge
o: ruie, while his strength was growing,
and a few days ago it was an uncertain tug
o:\var, with the chances largely in favor of
tiie heavy-weight stableman, and a big
storm brewing.
Now, for two or three months one Ed
ward Lanigan has Kept still and watched
the mess. He was neither Kainey nor
anti-Rainey, as far as anybody could find
out. Like Brer Fox, he "jis lay low and
say nuffiQ," He started out with the anti-
EuctcJeyites, through the influence of Wel
burn and McNab, with a good deal of
strength, and when the committee of
fifty appointed ti hew general com
mittee, and when the present one
was appointed by the "inside" through a
primary, he forced large concessions. He
shrewdly nursed his votes in the general
committee and his outside influence, and
wailed to see how things would turn out.
He has been holding sixty votes solidly
apart from the Rainey aild anti-Rainey
tight. These are votes that he can control
on any proposition, and with other dele
gates friendly to him he would be worth
ninety votes on some propositions.
Ten days ago Gavin McNab and Chair
man Sullivan themselves did not know
how Lanigan would go. It was conceded
by everybody that if Lanigan went with
l Rainey and Daggett the "'decent" element
i would be nowhere. With Lanigan they
might win by a smail majority. Lanigan
; knew that he held the balance of power
: and that he was about to be badly needed.
j He waited for his quotations to go up.
The inevitable has happened. He has
, been taken into the anti-Rainey camp
! upon his own terms. He has had no par
ticular enemies in the organization and so
i starts on his new career without that
i handicap in the faction, and he has long
I been personally friendly with McNab, who
; is mainly responsible for the new scheme
! that has just been evolved from the tangle.
Lanigan is to be the chief political
j manipulator of what is now expected to
I be the dominant faction in the Junta, and
j all the anti-Rainey and aiiti-Daggett
| forces are to get behind him and give nim
I a boost. The Junta's programme pre
i supposes, of course, winning at Sacramento
the battle against the Buckleyites, and
then later on for the control of local
Democratic poiiticf. Mr. Lanigan is to
lead the Junta to the pinnacle of success
if it can get there.
The other day, shortly after the new
I plan was effected. Chairman Sullivan ap
pointed a committee of eighteen to pre
j pare a constitution and by-laws, and a
| study of it shows the concessions to Ed
| Lanigan. He will run that committee.
j'lhe committee met last Monday niehi
and appointed a. sub-committee of five,
which, with the chairman and secretary,
are to draft the instrument. Four of tlie
live are Lanigan men. There is E. P.
Mogan, prosecuting attorney in Judge
Conlan'd Police Court, by the grace of
1 Lanigan's supervision. There is Dr. W.
J. Gavigan, who wants to be superintend-
I ent of the new Home for Inebriates', who
worked hard to get the appropriation
i through the Board of Supsrvisors, who
, had to ko to Lanigan for three votes, and i
j who is a friend of Ed's, appointed by him
to the general committee. Paul B. Hay !
and \V. A. Asmussen are the other two
friends of Lanigan. Frank McElrath is
j Eddie Graney's man, and his appointment
is a concession to Rainey. Chairman Sul
iivan and .Secretary McGovern will un
doubtedly work harmoniously wfth Lani
gan.
80 Lanigan, with the no-operation of
McNab and Sullivan, will prepare the con
stitution. It will to a large extent be
adapted to present exigencies. It is to be
arranged so that if Rainey is beaten he
can be kept beaten. There will be some
sort of an executive committee named by
Lanigan and appointed by Sullivan that
will mainly run things, and Kainey will
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
never get that executive committee. The
constitution will be adopted by a majority
| vote, and it is planned that it will provide
that a two-thirds vote shall be required to
amend it.
If, then, with Lanigan's help the next
I meeting of the general committee can be
j saved from Rainey, things will be cinched
and a new programme started. The first
j thing to do will be to control the delega
tion to the State convention. The propo
sition to appoint delegates is still un
settled, but much in favor. Laniean and
McNab can have a delegation exactly to
order that way and Rainey and Daggett
; will take what they get. A primary would
| be a terrible risk, even with Lanigan in
j spectors.
Of course Rainey'a interests are local,
! and he is helping Daggett to get the mint
power for himself later in reciprocity.
Daggett wants the delegation to Sacra
mento badly as does Welburn. A Rainey
triumph would mean that Daggett would
hog things. The "inside" is not fighting
Daggett particularly. It is willing to let
Daggett get a fair show at Sacramento,
but it wants the Rainey-Daggett business
to end at Sacramento, and to keep munici
pal politics for its own and not for Sam
Rainey.
So the new combination expects to say to j
the mint superintendent, "Mr. Daggett, I
you are welcome to a good deal of what you
want at Sacramento, but it would be bet
ter for us to have tne delegates and use
them in your interest."
The triumph of the Lanijran combina
tion in the Junta would also be Welburn's
triumph at Sacramento. Lanigan and
McNab would give Welburn as much a 9 it
would give Daggett, and Daggett wouldn't.
Welburn is supposed to be in this deal by
promising Lanigan his support in local
matters in return for favors. Welburn
will now see that Jack Welch and Thomas
P. Cusick of the Twenty -eighth and other
deputies of district influence behave them
selves properly in politics.
Welburn's hold on Lanigan is small, by
the way. Lanigan is too strong to be
bossed much by Welburn on the strength
of his little deputyship, and it is, rather,
a deal between them. Lanigan has long
aspired to political power, and has slowly j
increased it. He Has dispensed much of ;
the patronage of the present Board of Su
pervisors, has many friends among the
boys, and is a handsome, shrewd and
quite popular fellow. He has suddenly
struck a tide in his affairs that promises to
lead to political fortune Of course.there are
the battles with Rainey here and the battles
with the Buckleyites at Sacramento and at
home in the way of the new Laniean
dynasty, but they are different stories.
Lanigan wants local political power, and
the Junta is going to try to give it to him.
FAR EAST AND FAR WEST
Twenty-Third Annual Meeting of
the Woman's Occidental
Board.
Chinese Girls Entertain the Visitors.
Miss Hamlin Tells of the
Sarabjis.
There was the usual picturesque ming
ling of the Far West and the Far East at |
the twenty -third annual meeting of the \
Woman's Occidental Board, which took j
place yesterday at the Chinese Mission {
Home. The threÂ« days' session opened {
with an informal reception to Miss Warn
bold, the board's outgoing missionary to
Korea, and to the delegates from the vari- j
OUfl cities of California. The majority of !
the visitors were Americans, but the Chi- !
nese and Japanese girls were quite a fea- !
ture in the Oriental-looking rooms, and
the consul-general and his suite were pres
ent in gorgeous colors which Solomon in
all his glory might have courted.
The reception v.as distinctly informal.
There were enough visitors and delegates j
to comfortably rill the large board
rooms and leave enough people to spare to
circulate about the house and admire the
i quarters where the little rescued Chinese j
j girls live. Miss Wain bold, who is going to J
i labor among the Koreans, was shaken
j hands with and wished godspeeu by
every one present. Stie is a pleasant,
genial young woman, who does not seem >
10 feel any trepidation at the prospect of I
devoting the next few years of her life to
laboring in the Hermit Kingdom.
The real heroine of the occasion was
Miss Maria Culberison, who for so many
years has made a record as the zealous
matron of the home. For nearly a year
Miss Culbertson has been away on "sick
leave, and at one time il was feared that
she would never be able to tate up her i
work again. Yesterday, however, she was
back at her post and congratulations were
showered upon the matron at her recov
ery. Very early in the reception the Chi- 'â 
' nese showed by their suppressed excite- !
I meat that some scheme w.as on foot. At 'â 
i last one small maiden in blue, who speaks
! especially good English, darted out of the !
i room and returned laden with a huge 'â 
; basket of pink and red roses, which she
presented to the matron with the follow
ing carefully conned speech:
"My Dear Miss Culbertson, our mother:
We bring to you these few flowers, only to
show how we love you and how glad we
are to have you back once more. The
flowers will wither, but our love will never
die. Your Chinese Girls."
After the informal reception the exer
cises were opened with kindergarten songs
cleverly given by the Chinese children or
the home. Miss Sarah Hamlin then told
informally of the Sorabji family of India,
and most of her hearers listened with sur
prise and interest to what seemed like a
fairy tale of all that had been achieved by
a poor and low-caste woman. The central
idea of Miss Hamlin's lecture was the mar
velous intellectual possibilities of the
women of India. Mrs. Sorabji when a
child was picked almost out of the streets
and educated in the family of an English
missionary. Arrived at woman's estate
she was married to a high-caste Parsee
named Sorabji, who for embracing Chris- i
tianity had become an outcast from his
family.
The Sorabjis had eleven children, seven
of them daughters, and, not having the !
means to educate them, set to work to ;
educate themselves in order to instruct '
their offspring. So marvelous was their
success that Mrs. Sorabji is now principal
of the largest school in Poonah, where
white people come to learn from her. and
the fourth daughter, Cornelia, after being '
the first woman to go through the law ;
course at the University of Oxlord, is now
one of the most successful lawyers in
India and is generally considered to be
the most learned woman in the world.
The exercises ended with the close of
Miss Hamlin's lecture. To-day there will
j be an all-day session of the Occidental â¢
Board; Miss P. D. Brown, the president
! will again direct the exercises. The follow- i
ing ladies are the vice-presidents: Mrs !
George Barstow, Mrs. J. G. Chown Mrs'
E. V. Robbins, Mrs. E. Y. Garrette, Mrs'
J. Q. Adams, Mrs. S. Minor, Mrs. W S i
Bartlett.
Sued for Malicious Arrest.
Edward Blaser has sued Henry Meyer in the
Justice's Court for $299, of which $274 is de
manded for damages for malicious arrest.
Blaser was arrested early in last month on a
charge of obtaining property by false pre
tenses, sworn out by Meyer. The case was tried
before Judge Campbell and dismissed The
plaintiff claims that the defendant acted ma
liciously and without probable cause, and that
in defending himself and procuring an acquit
tal he was put to an expense of .f 25. He asks
the full amount over which ihe Justice's Court

Burned to Death.
Fung Chunp, a Chinese cook, was burned to
death m the fire that destroyed the lodging
house at 834 Washington street at an early
hour yester.lay morning. The Chinaman was
asleep in his bunk at the time of the fire. The
body was removed to the Morgue.

DISAPPOINTED IN LOVE
A Sailor's Bride Who Married
From Pique Tries to End
Her Life.
SWALLOWS A DOSE OF OPIUM.
Romantic Career of the Wife of Cap
tain Harry Johnson of the
Bark Enoch Talbot.
Anna Johnson, the handsome young
bride of Captain Harry Johnson of the
bark Enoch Taibot now lying in the bay
off the Arctic Oil Works at the Potrero,
attempted to commit suicide on board the
ship Tuesday night and nearly succeeded.
There is an air of mystery and romance !
about the affair, but from all that could be j
learned the young bride made the attempt â 
in a fit of despondency resulting from dis
appointment in her marriage.
She was married to Captain Johnson
about four weeks ago in Los Angeles after
an acquaintance of three months, and
they spent their honeymoon on the trip
from San Pedro to this port.
The vessel arrived here a week ago last
Tuesday, after a tedious voyage. Mrs.
Johnson was almost a stranger to the
City, and iast Friday the captain went
ashore, taking her with him. As he had
business with the owners he put her on a
car for Golden Gate Park, arranging to
meet her later. When she returned from
the park she failed to meet her husband
and wandered around the business portion
of the City looking for him till darkness
set in. She did not know how to find the
vessel, but by chance she met an old
friend, Elizabeth Emmet, who lives near i
the Hayes-street entrance to the park, and j
accepted her invitation to accompany her
home.
She was taken sick there and remained
in her friend's care till Tuesday night.
when she returned to the vessel,
haying learned its location. Meantime
Captain Johnson, alarmed at his wife's j
unexplained absence, had been scouring j
the City for her and had emoloyed pri- !
vate detectives to find her if possible.
When Mrs. Johnson reached the vessel
she was dismayed to learn from Mate j
Norby tnat her husband was not on board
and it was not known when he would re- j
turn.
She went into her cabin and after awhile
she began to think that her husband had
deliberately cast her adrift. Then the
idea of suicide occurred to her and she i
went to where the ship's drugs were kept |
and took a bottle of opium. She swallowed
a dose and calmly lay down in her bunk
to await death.
About 1 o'clock yesterday morning
Captain Johnson returned to the ship from j
his fruitless search. He found his wife I
un'.onscious, and the bottle of opium by i
her side told him the story. He aroused I
the mate, who hurriedly Pressed himself â 
and hunted up Dr. De Witt. The doctor l
did all he couid with the appliances at j
hand for the an conscious woman and then
notified Lieutenant Bennett of the Potrero
police station, who had her removed to
the Receiving Hospital in the patrol
wagon.
They reached the hospital about 4 '
o'clock, and Dr. Bunnell promptly took
effective measures to restore her to life.
He gave her an antidote, and for three or
four hours she was kept walking round
and round the courtyard in front of the
hospital till she gradually revived. Yes
terday afternoon she had sufficiently re
covered to be taken io a friend's house.
She was at first disinclined to talk, and
made some rambling statements of a sen
sational nature, which she afterward de
j nied making, saying she was so weak and
excited that she did not know what she
was talking about.
Finally she consented to tell the romance
of her life. "I am an English girl," she
said, "but my parents emigrated to the
United States when I was a mere child.
After toy father's death my mother put
me on the stage, and as I gave promise of
having a contralto voice of more than
ordinary power a bright future was pre
dicted for me.
"While still a young girl 1 joined the
Enima Abbott Company, and remained
with them for a number of years. My j
stage name was Beatrice Lee, and under
thÂ«it name I sang at the Grpiieum in this
City seven years ago. My stage career
was cut short by the loss of my voice, !
which had been injured by the hard train- {
ing 1 got while little more than a child.
"With the loss of my voice came a stroke '
of fortune in the marriage of my mother j
to Thomas Hughes, a retired and wealthy
lumber merchant of Los Angeles. I went
to live with my mother after her marriage
and remained with them till two years j
ago. when I had a quarrel with my step
father. After that I went to the home of
some friends in Los Angeles, and it was
there I met Captain Johnson.
"He offered to marry me and give me a j
home, and as I thought I loved him 1 con

sented. We were married four weeks ago.
I was sick and tired of being dependent
upon my friends, and I was happy after
my marriage."
Captain Johnson was asked as to the
motive that prompted his wife to attempt
to commit suicide and he replied that he
! did not know. "She complained of head
aches," he said, "and I suppose she had
taken the opium to ease the pain. That is
the only way I can account for ii. :>
Mate Norby was asked the same ques
tion and he reluctantly said, "disappoint
ment." When asked in what respect he
remained silent.
From other sources it was learned that
Mrs. Johnson quarreled with her lover in
Los Angeles, and in a fit of pique con
sented to marry Captain Johnson. She is
a handsome, refined woman, 26 years of
age, with dark hair, large dark-blue eyes
and beautiful nands. Her underclothing
astonished Matron Keane of the Receiv
ing Hospital, as it was of tbe finest im
ported quality. Her husband is a bluff
sailor, without any of the graces and ac
complishments that would find favor with
such a woman.
The cabin in which she spent her honey
moon could not be more barely furnished
and the smell of oil that pervades the at
mosphere is enough to drive a refined
woman crazy.
FITZGERALD TO THE "BEE"
The Attorney- General Outlines
His Position on the Bond
Issue.
He Believes State Moneys Should Be
Invested Only in Bonds Above
Reproach.
In one of yesterday evening's papers
the following telegram was published:
SACRAMENTO, April I.â The Bee to-night
will publish a story to the effect that, not
withstanding the fact that the law provides
that whenever there shall be $10,000 in the
j State-school land fund the same shall be in
vested, there is at present nearly $300,000 iv
the fund.
The Bee will also say that this is due to the
fact that Attorney-General Fitzgerald has
placed his stamp of disapproval upon the
bonds of various counties, many of the issues
of which have already been tnken up by some
of the leading banks in the state. â¢
The paper will further affirm that the State
i is believed to be the holder of many bonds
which, if the Attorney-General is correct, are
absolutely valueless and that, although he did
not consider these county bonds a safe invest
j ment, he refused to give his sanction to an in-
I vestment of $200,000 in the late National bond
j issue, and that by this means many thousands
of dollars of interest have been "lost to the
schools of the State.
Mr. Fitzgerald's attention being called
j to the dispatch he displayed no particular
I concern.
"An attack of this character," he re
, marked, "is really not worth noticing. A
man in a public position must expect to
b.e a target for abuse from certain quar
ters, and I cannot hope to be the solitary
i exception to the rule. So far as lam per
j sonally concerned I do not consider'the
i dispatch deserving of any attention what
i ever, and what is more I can see no rea
! son for noticing it officially. Still, since
; the matter of county bonds has been thus
j strangely misrepresented it may not be
j out of place for me to briefly outline my
official policy recarding them.
"In rejecting the county bonds in ques
i tion I did so because, in my opinion, the
j proceedings under which they were issued
â  were defective. I consider that the State
â  should purchase no bonds which are not
I absolutely above suspicion or reproach in
i every particular. If ttie State has in the
! past purchased bonds not altogether un
! impeachable, that fact, if indeed it be a
â  fact at all, does not iv any way influence
I me in passing upon the validity of the
; proceedings for the issuance of any bonds
which may be submitted to the State
Board of Examiners witn a view to their
i being purchased by the State.
"I have not advocated, nor do I advo-
I cate, the investment of State money in
i bonds of the United States, because I be-
I lieve it to be the duty of the State to
j invest the said money in bonds of the State
; or of the various counties in the State,
I rather than in United States bonds.
"Owing to the fact that the proceedings
I for the issuance of State and County
! bonds have been in m:;ny cases most un
satisfactory in the past, I have personally
undertaken to examine all future proceed
ings before the bonds are issued, in order
to insure legality in their issuance, and
I with the object of rendering such bonds
acceptable to the State as a safe and relia
ble investment.
"I consider that if I were to advise the
board to purchase bonds, the title to
[ which was not absolutely perfect in every
I respect. I would be guilty of a flagrant
j violation of my bounden "duty as aii offi
cer of the State. And what is'more. I fur
| ther consider that by taking the precau
: tions outlined in order to secure the
issuance of valid bonds, I am doing all
I that can be expected of me, and even
j more, in the faithful discharge of my
duties as Attorney-General."
There is nothing that astonishes a
stranger visiting Australia for the first
time so much as the variety and beauty of
its flowers.

TANStmp/LLSNET PROFITS
OF THE ROADS.
Much Larger Than Had
Been Admitted by the
Companies
A HEAVY BONDED DEBT.
The Attorney-General Says That
It Exceeds the Value of
the Property.
CAUSING EXORBITANT RATES.
Remarkable Showing Made in the
United States Circuit Court in
the Railroad Case.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald spoke all
day yesterday in Judjre McKenna's court
and bandied a mass of figures and statis
tics that would have distracted an ordi
nary layman. The figures were those of
the railroad company, and were quoted to
phow that the business was yielding large
profisa ami that the bonded indebtedness
of the roads was greater than their value.
In the morning he resumed his showing
::,;a*nsi the railroad company on its report
for 18M4. He argued ;hat the report had
been doctored to show a deficiency -%-hen
in fact the net profile of t'je entire Pacific
system amounted to $384,000 in 1804, and
on tbe California sy.-iein to $350.00(1, mak
ing a total net profit from all sources of
: ore than one million dollars.
He argued also from the Company's own
report that the railroad company had used
The cost of the betterments for the pur
pose ot showing a deficit, ana also for
showing an added cost of construction
over an^ above the actual cost. The at
torneys for the company had riled the re
port as part of the evidence, only for which
(Sot he would not have been allowed to
use it in his argument.
The Attorney-General spent considerable
time in replying to Mr. Herrin's argument
that the cost of the ro&B exceeded their
bonded indebtedness. Mr. Herrin, he
said, had stated that there were additions
and bettefinents not being in the nature of
repairs or mere operating expenses from
1870 to 1874 amounting to 18,908,518 L&
Included in the bill of the complainant as
operating expenses are these items, based
ur><m the estimate? of Engineer Stevens:
Southern Pacific of Arizona â Cost of
construction, 17,003,86009; additions, bet
terments and improvements, $3,020.0-. JO ;
total cost. 110,023,860; bonded indebted
ness, $1' â¢/.Â»'â  â¢.. 0 '.
Southern Pacific of New Mexicoâ Cost of
construction. $.i.Â«'>4Â»,572 20: betterments,
etc.. $560,378 36; a total of $4,213,950 46.
Northern Railwayâ Cose, 49,419,903 02;
betterments, etc., $f,003.000 10; total, $10,
--454.903 12.
The Attorney-General asked the court to
â¢carefully consider this question of better
ments and additions. He contended that
tne plaintiff operated the Northern Cali
fornia "Railway Company as though it
We're its own property lor the term of forty
years at a nominal rental of $1 per year";
therefore, the impiovements and better
hientsmust.be treated as an addition to
the value of its own property.
The plaintiff has availed* itself of these
expenditures for additions, improvements
and betterments for the purpose of show
ing an apparent increase in the cost of
construction, and it could not again avail
itself of them for the purpose of increasing
the operating expenses so as to create an
alleged deficit.
The speaker next proceeded to show the
values of the roads, as sworn to by the
proper railway officials under oath in "mak
ing their returns to the Assessors, and the
value of the steamboats, etc., as made by
the Assessors.
Central Pacific Railroad â Franchise,
roadbed, etc., $8,702,671; Assessor's valua
tion on ateamboats, etc., $5,516,895; total,
$14,219,569.
Southern Pacific Railroad Company of
California â Franchise, etc.. $11,106,369;
Assessors valuation, $5,012,973; total, $16,
--119 32.
California Pacific Railroad Company-
Franchise, etc., $1,350,000; Assessor's
valuation, $54,935; total, $1,404,935.
Northern Railway C0mpanyâ 53,445,542;
-or's valuation, $175,110; total,
13,620,952:
The total valuation of all the roads was
given by the speaker at $47,695,728 and the
bonded indebtedness at $102,386,900, so
that the value of the property, according
to Mr. Towne's sworn statement to the
Assessor, was less than one-half of the
bonded indebtedness. Then the following
statements were read:
Central Pacific (in California)â Bonded
indebtedness. $35,420,000; excess of bonded
indebtedness over value, $15,691,533; actual
value, $19,000,000, the bonded indebtedness
being more than two-thirds greater than
the value.
Southern Pacific Railroad Companyâ
"Bonded indebtedness, $43,652,400 ; actual
va1ue... 521,132,205; excess, $22,520,195. Here
the indebtedness is more than rwice the
value of tbe road.
California Pacific Railroad Companyâ
Indebtedness more than four and a half
times the. value of the road.
The excess of the bonded indebtedness
over the actual value of the Northern Rail
way Company was $SBB,7rto.
"Those are the valuations of the Asses
sor," suggested Judge Garber.
"They are the valuations as furnished
by you to tbe Assessor; as furnished by
Mr. Towne under oath," replied the Attor
ney-General.
The excess of the bonded indebtedness
of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
over the value was $4,127,048, continued
the speaker. The aggregate bonded in
debtedness of the roads in California was
$102,380/ tOO and their actual value only
$47;69%7â¬6. The bonded indebtedness of
the roads to the Government was not in
cluded in the foregoing, and the annual
interest of $5,505,753 is nearly 12 per cent
oi the actual value or the roads.
"The corn.plair.ant asks," continued the
Epeaker, "that the shippers of California
should be burdened with exorbitant rates
in order that theymay make, a profit upon
this enormously disproportionate bonded
indebtedness. They .-ay to the Assessor
under oath that this "property is worth
$47,000,000 and to the court in this case
they say it is worth more than $10^,000,000.
They are acting in bad faith in this case,
and .t bey are not entitled to anything iii
equity.
â¢\\ hile the valuation, as shown by the
Assessor, is not evidence of its value in
other cases, in this case the comp'ainant
Las furnished the court with a definite
standard by which the real value of tile
properly may bo arrived at. It has shown
that it is the custom of Assessors to assess
property at oC dct cent of its commercial
value. Therefore the valuation doubled
may be taken as the actual commercial
value of the property assessed."
Ti.e- Attorney-Genera! argued that Mr.
Herrin had omitted from his statement
|27,000,000 of bonded indebtedness of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company to the
Government and $18,000,000 of interest,
which made the total bonded indebted
ness $102,024,000, or $29,000,000 more than
Mr. Herrin's estimate. He added that it
was manifest that the road was saddled
with an indebtedness many millions of
dollars in excess of its value to-day.
The statement of Senator Stanford
was quoted to the effect that the entire
cost of the road should not have been
more than 70 per cent of what it actually
did cost, by reason of its construction be
ing pushed forward in inordinate haste.
Engineer Hcod's report to Senator Stan
ford was also quoted, in which Mr. Hood
said that if more time had been taken in
the buiiding of the road, the entire road
could have been built for 75 per cent less
than its actual cost.
The Southern Pacific of New Mexico ex
pend. -d $567,387 26 for additions and bet
terments, and but for those additions the
cost of the road would have fallen below
its bonded indebtedness.
With reference to the sub ect of the net
profits of the roads in California for the
yeÂ«r 1894 the Attorney-General said that
that year, by reason of the great railroad
strike and the tieup of tne road for several
weeks in the busiest part of the green
deciduous fruit season, was far below the
average in business depression. He
showed that notwithstanding the strike
the California roads realized a net profit of
$2,38-3,183.
The hour of 4 o'clock having arrived,
the court took a recess until 11 o'clock this
morning. Attorney-General Fitzgerald re
marked that he expected to conclude his
argument this morning.
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
The California tour of the Mormon Taber
nacle choir will cost that body the snug little
sum of $15,000. It has a treasury in excellent
shape, however, its pro ills arising out of the
prizes it has won in the big contests in which
it has taken part and the concerts it gives in
the mammoth Tabernacle at Salt Lake.
The choir will give five frand concerts at
Metropolitan Temple, April 15 to 19. Season
tickets will be on sale on and after April ti at
Sherman, Clay ci'Co.'s.

VINING GETS A SCORING
The Superintendent Hauled Over
the Coals With No Gen
tle Hand.
Lively Resolutions at the Meeting of
the Point Lobos Avenue Im
provement Club.
.Enthusiasm was by no means lacking at
last night's meeting of the Point Lobos
avenue Improvement Club. Crossthwaite's
Hall on Fifth avenue was the scene of the
gathering, which was presided over by
George R. Fletcher, president of the club.
Announcement was made that the
Superintendent of Streets had issued a
call for bids on the contract for clearing
Twenty-fourth avenue of drifting sand in
which it is at present submerged; also
that the grade of First avenue in the sec
tion now being paved would beredeced to
8 per cent in order to render the ascent of
vehicles less difficult. The committee on
the First avenue boulevard having lost one
of its members through the resignation of
G. Frohman the vacautplace was supplied
by the election of P. Filippini, the other
two members of tbe committee being Luke
Battles and F. T. Newberry.
The streetcar service in Richmond dis
trict was severely criticized.
R. M. Wood said he had seen rriotormen
on the Sutro line allow cars to attain a
speed of fully twenty miles an hour, and
yet omit to ring the bell at the street
crossings.
"Eight miles, I believe," remarked Mr.
Fletcher, "is the legal maximum of speed,
but sometimes it looks as though the gait
were nearer eignty. I suppose the thing
will be regulated after a lew women and.
children shall have Dcen killed."
Daniel P. Fenton opined that it would
be better to say nothing on tbe subject for
the present as some o; the offending nio
tormen had been discharged and others
warned that they would lose their posi
tions if they did not use some degree of
care and prndence in running the cars.
Tne club then proceeded to- pay its com
pliments to Mr. Vining of the Market
street Railway Company by adopting reso
lutions that were prefaced by a very sar
castic preamble in which Mr. Vining and
his ''peculiar transfer system" were
handled without gloves albeit with a gooa
deal of biting humor and satire. The res
olutions themselves were as follows:
fttsolved. That this club and the people of the
Richmond District pledge themselves to use
their best endeavors to have inserted in the
platforms of the political parties a plank I
pledging the candidates to the Senate and A-
â embiy to introduce and carry through the
I'omiug Legislature a bill that no streetcar
shall carry more passengers than there are seats
lor iv the car, and that the price of a single
fare on any street railroad shall not exceed '.i
cents, or shall be two fares for 5 cents; and be
ft further
Jicsolrtd, That the secretary be instructed to
forward a copy of this preamble and resolution
to every improvement club In this City and
also to the Merchants' Aswociation, and that
5000 copies be printed for distribution asking
the clubs and the public to co-operate with
tnis club to brine this important public ques
tion to a successful issue.
Mr. Fenton called attention to the con
dition of the sidewalk in front of tke
Sutro Primary School, on Twelfth avenue,
the boards of which were in so rotten a j
state that in his opinion there was great |
danger of children tripping and foiling.
The executive committee was ordered to
investigate the matter and report UDon it
to the Board of Education.
"It's the most villainous piece of busi
ness I ever saw," added Mr. Fenton by
way of a commentary.
Residents were reported as not being
desirous of going about with lanterns by
night, as many of them are said to have
been doing hitherto. A petition is to be
prepared calling the attention of the Bu
| penutendent of Streets to the matter.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 1896.
NO T ON PLEASURE BENT.
The Yacht Coronet Here to
Take a Party of Scientists
to Japan.
BHE CAME AROUND THE HORN.
Her Millionaire Owner and His Guests
Expected Here in a Couple
of Days.
The American yacht Coronet arrived
from New York yesterday after a fair
passage of 118 days. Captain C. S. Crosby
brought her around the Horn and is dis
appointed that he did not make the run in
"at least three weeks' better time. Arthur
Curtis James, her millionaire owner, made
a better guess than the man who has
handled the handsome schooner from the
day she was launched. Mr. James cave
the yacht 120 days in which to reach San
Francisco and laid his plans accordingly.
Inside of forty-eight hours he and the
party that is accompanying him may be
expected here. In consequence tbe Coro
net's anchor was barely down before the
crew was hard at work getting thing 3
shipshape in expectation of the owner's
arrival.
The Coronet is 152 tons register, 134 feet
over all and 128 feet on the water line. She j
is 27 feet broad and 12 feet 6 inches deep.
Her main boom is 75 feet long and her
main gaff 45 feet. Her foreboom is 37 fct \
and foregaff'3s feet and her jibboom 20;
feet. She carries besides her mainsails a I
jib, riving jib, jib-topsail nnd fore-topsail.
She was built in 18:<5, and is now as stanch
as the day she was launched. There is
nothing alow or aloft that is not in per
fect proportion, and the Coronet can be
put down as one of the prettiest yachts
that has been seen in the bay for a long
time.
Captain C. S. Crosby's chief officer is M.
C. Gilbert, and under him there is a sec
ond mate, eight sailors, a cook and stew
ard. In speaking about the trip the
skipper said : "The Coronet belongs to the
New York Yacht Club, and our run oi 118
days was a long one, I think. We had
heau winds in the North Atlantic nnd no
trades in the South Atlantic. In rounding
the Horn we were only fifteen days in get
ting from 53 to ;">3, and off the cape we did
not have aa heavy weather aa we had a
few days ago off the coast of California.
The Coronet is a fast boat, but the ele
ments were against us. The year after
she was built she raced the yacht Daunt
less from New York to Southampton and
beat her thirty hours. Since that time she
has made four trips to Europe and been
once around the world. In 1888 she was
in San Diego, and on that occasion John
D. Spreckels paid us a visit. Rufu? Wood
was then owner of the yacht, and when he
died Mr. James purchased her.
"The Coronet is here to take a party of
scientists to Japan to make observations
of the eclipse of the sun which takes place
in August. The party will be headed by
Professor Todd of Amherst College, and,
including Mr. James and his wife, there
will be fifteen all told. We have all the
instruments provided by the college on
the yacht, so as soon as Mr. James ar
rives we will be ready for a start."
The Coronet has six large staterooms all
magnificently furnished, a dining-room
ana smoking-room, so the party of fifteen
may have no fear of being crowded. At her
fore she flies the colors of Amherst Col
legeâa star and crescent on a green
ground. On her aftermast she flies the
colors of the New York Yacht Club. After
their observations are completed the yacht
will return to San Francisco and the party
will go home overland.
MRS. STOCKTON CAST OUT
Unanimously Excommunicated
From Dr. Brown's Fold of
the Church.
Communion Postponed Until the First
Sunday in Mayâ Proceedings at
the Prayer-Meeting.
Mrs. Stockton's name no longer adorns
the roll of membership of the First Con
gregational Church of this City. She was
excommunicated last ni^ht and cast into
outer darkness, where there ia weepini?
and wailing and gnashing of teeth. And
when the church passes her by in the
street the cbureh will gather its skirts
close lest they should brush those of the
ex-member whom the pastor last night
called a person.
When the business part of the prayer
meeting arrived Brother Christianson of
the standing committee read a brief re
port indefinitely announcing that charges
had been preferred against Mrs. M. A.
Stockton, that she had been cited to ap
pear before the committee, that she has
failed to appear and that the committee
recommended that she be excommunicated
from the church.
Dr. Brown, as calmly as though he were
announcing a text, asked what should be
done with the report. Some one in the
audience, between Deacon Morse, who sat
in front, and Brother Nagle. who modestly
occupied a chair in the rear, moved that
the committee's recommendation be
adopted.
"You have heard the motion duly made
and supported," said Dr. Brown. "All
you who are in favor hold up the hand."
The hands went up.
"Contrary-minded, if any?"
There being no contrary minds, the pas
tor added : "It is so ordered. The clerk
will so inform the person named of the
action of this congregation."
And thus the name of the fair kisser or
kiseee, as the case might be, was stricken
from the roll of membership.
Letters were received irom other churches
requesting that the following-named per
sons be received into membership in the
First Congregational church: Mr. and
Mrs. F. E. Adams, from the Grand-avenue
Congregational Church of Milwaukee;
Mrs. A. F. Jordan, from the church in
National City, Cal., and Charles W. Heath
of Spokane, Wash.
The following applications for member
ship on profession of faith were referred to
the standing committee: Mrs. L. V. Bux
ton, Mrs. F. Idenmuller, Miss B. Jacques,
i Tt omas Jacques, Master Thomas Jacques,
Master F. H. Idenmuller, Master William
C. Idenmuller, Mrs. M. F. Clayton and
Mrs. I. T. McL,eary.
The lesson of the evening was on the
humility of Paul and the humility of
Christ. Deacon Dexter, in his prayer,
asked a blessing on the absent ones who
had been accustomed to meet there and
who were now elsewhere. Deacon Vascon
sellos prayed "that we may learn from day
to day and from sad experience of things
that have been to draw nearer to Thee."
Rev. Dr. Kimball made some comments
on the lesson. He believed that there
was in the churches and the Christians to
day a pood deal of the humility of St.
Paul and the Savior, but that more was
needed. Those who wished to exemplify
the true Christian spirit should give up
big ambitions, hÂ« said, and be filled with
the wonderful simplicity, unselfishness
and humility.
Rev. A. R. Sherriff, R. S. Szanik and
Mry. C. H. Williams were granted letters
of withdrawal.
Announcement was made that the Eas
ter communion had been postponed until
the first Sunday in May.
The attendance last night was large,
about two hundred people being present.
When Dr. Brown was asked after the
meeting whether there was any truth in
the report that he was going to" resign he
pointed to his audience and asked. "Does
that look as if I was going to resign ?" He
added that he had never said to any one
that he intended offering his resignation.
MATCHING BOXERS.
Tommy Ryan Will Not Meet George
Green â Corrigan and Van
Buskirk.
A young man named Corrigan visited
Billy Kennedy, the superintendent of the
Olympic Club, last evening and asked to
be matched against Van Buskirk, the
champion heavyweight boxer of the club.
Neithtr Johnson, the boxing instructor
of the Sacramento Athletic Club, nor
"Soldier" Walker, also of Sacramento, will
consent to a meeting with the Olympic
champion.
Johnson excuses himself by asking the
club to hang up a purse which he is well
aware will not be given. This is a pleas
ant way some pugilists have of avoiding a
good whipping.
Corrigan is said to be a hard puncher.
He came to this country from Australia
with George Dawson, and is very anxious
that Superintendent Kennedy pick out
some good man from among the middle or
heavy weight pugilists so that he (Corri
gan) may have an opportunity of proving
to the amateur boxing-match maker that
he can go a good race against the best tal
ent now procurable.
Kennedy will give him a "try-out" anil
if Corrigan proves worthy of recognition
he will be matched against Van Buskirk
for six rounds, the contest to take place at
the Pavilion in May. McGinley, the clever
Australian light-weight boxer, will be
asked for his opinion of Corrigan to-day.
Tommy Ryan of Chicago telegraphed
Kennedy last evening that it would be
impossible for him to meet George Green
in May &z he is under the doctor's care
and will not be physically able to.settle
down to a course of training for some
months. Ryan received a severe beating
from McCoy in their last engagement.
Kennedy telegraphed Jack Everhardt,
Billy Myers, Jack McAuliffe and George
Dawson last night that if either of the
quartet would consent to a ten-round con
test with George Green, the winner would
receive $1000 and the loser $250. Kennedy
says that the first, man to answer in the
affirmative will be matched. He expects
an answer to some of the dispatches toÂ«
day.
It is said that the National Athletic
Club wjll matcn Joe McAuliffe to box
twenty rounds against Armstrong, a pro
tege of "Parson" Davies, the mill to come
off at Colnia in June.
The .Name Ought to Be Known.
An old colored man who wheels rubbish
out of alleys in a Southside residence dis
trict, according to the Chicago News, con
siders hirftself pretty well known among
the people away from whose back doors he
pushes ashes. Yesterday morning one of
the gentlemen who employs the African
walked out in his back yard* and spoke fa
miliarly to the ashwheeler.
"What is your name?" he asked, in ad
dressing the colored man.
"George Washington," was the reply.
"Washington â Washington," repeated
the gentleman. "It seems to me I have
heard that name before."
"Guess you have," replied the African.
"I have been wheeling ashes out of these
alleys for 'bout ten years."

A Short Sujipi y of Ink.
At a banquet in Cleveland last week
Billy Kountz told the following story, in
his quick, characteristic way. He said:
"Arriving in Pittsburg the other night on
a late train, I dropped into Newell's for a
bite to eat. While waiting for my order,
I heard two waiters conversing in barely
audible undertones. The first speaker
said: "Sandowcame in last night after the
theater and had some blue points and a
bottle of Bass. On getting his check he
laid a $100 bill on the table, took out a
stylograph ic pen and wrote Sandow across
the face of the note. I asked, 'Why did
you do that, Mr. Sandow?' 'Oh,' replied
the strong man, 'I always write my name
on every $100 bill I break.' Then up spoke
the other waiter, who hadn't said a word
yet, 'Do you know, i used to do that, too;
but I rau out of ink.' "â Pittsburg Dis
patch.
Joseph Winkelmaier, an Austrian who
was burn in 1805 and died in 1887, reached
the reputed height of 8 feet 9 inches. In
bis case, at least, there is no question that
the measurements were properly authen
ticated.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April I.â Wheat took on a little
more strength this morning than it possessed at
the close yesterday. In explanation of the better
feeling, firmer Liverpool cables, light Northwest
ern receipts, 257 cars, against 52- last week, 190 a
year ago, and some dry weather reports from Kan
sas were cited. There was moderately good selling
right at the opening and the full advance was not
retained permanently. Another rally took place,
however, when the New York clearances. 368.
--155 bushels, were posted. Outside business was
notable for its scarcity, while the volume of local
tracing was decidedly ordinary. Receipts at Chi
cago were 10 cars and 284.000 bushels were with
drawn from store. Total Atlantic seaboard clear
ances an ousted to 335.348 buslvels. The only
change in quotations in Continental markets was a
decline of % mark at Berlin. | May wheat opened
from tio. r \y(a6.V : c. sold between 633/gc and 63"
closing at D3-'i(a6S';/gc, spc higher than yesterday.
Estimated receipts lor to-morrow 12 cars.
CORNâ Was a Dene fie of the merit of wheat
and prices under the influence of sympathy with
the finer grain, displayed a fair proportion of firm
ness. Business was. however, at a standstill, no
incident or event of unusual interest being noted.
Liverpool cables were quiet and firm. Receipts i
were 134 cars, 1:6 less than estimated. There i
were no withdrawals from store. Export clear- |
ances were 152,526 bushels. May corn opened at
29 % c, advanced to 2P."- g ! ; 4 c. where it closed,
14c higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 150 cars.
OATSâ Had a quiet session, with prices ruling
steady to firm most of the time. The influence for
strength came ;rom the leadine train markets.
Receipts were 117 cars and 122,150 bushels were
withdrawn from store. May oats closed 3 8 c higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
100 cars.
LAXâ Was easy. Cash, 88@88'4c: May. 86Ha
(&S7Vic: June, 87 Vic bid; September, 90@91Vic
Receipts were 12 cars.
â¢ PROVISIONSâ The tone of product was firmer
this morning, shorts covering a considerable
amount of the property sold yesterday. The
strength exhibited by grain was an inducement to
buyers. The hog market was lower, but that had I
little if any effect on product. May pork closed 25 !
@'i 7y 3 c higher, May lard 7%c higher and May
ribs io higher.

CANNED AND DRIED FRUITS AND
SALMON.
The Cutting Packing; Company's circular says:
SALMONâ Transactions in spot goods are of ex
tremely meager character; considerable doing in
futures of Alaska â¢ and some small booking of
Columbia River at a shade less for the latter than
last year's prices on account of an anticipated
lower price for raw fish, as the packers are making
a stand to resist the extreme demands of the
I fishermen, claiming that they cannot pack to any
profit at the high prices of last year and compete
with the lower-priced fish of British Columbia ami
Alaska. The result of these efforts is not yet
known. The Alaska Packers' Association has not
yet given any intimation of what prices it will put j
upon the various grades. From the preparations
being made In all directions it is' safe to predict a
large pack, especially In low-grade fish, which finds I
I favor on account of its cheapness in the United j
States trade, particularly in the Southern and 1
Southwestern States.
CANNED FRUITSâ After discounting all re
ports from the sections affected by frost early in
j March we find that the almond crop as a whole,
apricots and peaches partially, and cherries in a
still less degree, arc-severely Injured north of the
latitude of Maryaville and in a few localities south
of that line. Otherwise the crop throughout the
Stale of all varieties is one of the largest and best
quality ever known. â  This is very satisfactory and
gratifying after the great scare naturally following !
the heavy frost and unusual snow. The weather !
during the post two weeks has been exceptionally j
warm, and there is still a chance for more frost,
which would do even more damage than thai oc
curring before, on account of the trees being in a
still more forward condition. This, however, Is |
hardly probable. There is absolutely no trade ex- |
I cept a light jobbing one from the Territories. | Now
I and then inquiries are made for a car. but usually |
1 for a much smaller quantity. So far no values or
prices apparently have been made or even consid
ered by grower or packer.
There Is a species of fight going on in future of
peas and tomatoes, but little if any actual trade is '
resulting therefrom. Spot tomatoes are still dull 1
at 70<a.7Ui 2 e for 2% lbs. and $1 90 for gallons.
! Quotations are out for future asparagus, which is
about two weeks earlier than usual.
DRIED FRUITSâ is but little change in
the situation since our last circular: the demand
has been light on all varieties, and such sales as
have â  been made have been In hand to mouth
quantities.
Prunesâ Are firm, yet there is little demand,
no Interest is manifest in a carload way, and the 4
sizes quotable at 3%c go a-begging.
Peachesâ Of choice and prime quality are in
good supply, but fancy stock Is scarce. The princi
pal inquiry comes for raisins. Stocks on the coast
are fast being cleaned up, and there is now every
indication of an advance in values.

COAL â A circular for Australia says: "There
will be fully due to arrive here prior to June 1
about 3H.000 tons Australian, and there is in all
about 100,000 tons Coal capacity chartered for
here, of which over; one-half will be loaded in the
next three months. Values have declined fully 6%
j during March and several cargoes have changed i
i hands, and for late loading there are more offerings i
1 than can find buyers. . There is now a very small |
j quantity of Wallsend on hand, hence this grade Is j
In demand at full figures. Recent cables from
Newcastle. N. 8. 1 W., report every Indication of a
general strike among the Coal miners in that sec
tion.. If the colliery proprietors do not accede to
the miners' demands within a few days there will
he a general -tie-up' this mouth. The operatives
have selected a most opportune time to carry their
point, as Newcastle harbor Is full of vessels seek- j

KELLY HEARS OF GOLD.
The Property of His Uncle
Who Was Drowned Going

A SUSPICIOUS WILL FOUND.
News From Philadelphia That Causes
an Oaklander Great
Anxiety.
â  Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
â¢â¢'â¢ â¢-â¢â¢ 908 Broadway, April 1. j
. ' â¢ Patrick Kelly, a real estate dealer of this
city, is in a most uneasy frame of mind.
He has the mortification of knowing that
an estate valued at 000, 000 is probably
; : distributed to a youncr lady named Miss
. Elizabeth Kelly of Philadelphia, which
.." should become the property of himself
â¢ -and seven other heirs.
â¢.The claim of the reai estate man is built
. â¢â  on a Story he read in the newspapers some
: . .--time Since that time he has been
â¢ corresponding with Philadelphia lawyers
: ". ana Irish relatives. The story consisted
; of a telegraphic dispatch from Philadel
: phia which reads as follows:
-PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 14.â A fortune, esti
' mated at $15,000,000, will be soon secured by
Elizabeth Kelly, as the heiress of the Aus
tralian estate of Peter Kelly, her uncle. The
Kelly family live in an unpretentious dwelling
â¢ at TS33 Natonia street, in tins city. William
Keliy, father of the annonnced heiress, is a
gardener. Peter Kelly, it is said, left his home
in tfae county of Lancashire, England, many
years ago to svek his fortune in the gold fields
â¢' of Australia. He became rich, and started to
r.et.urn. to England, but the ship was wrecked,
: . and her was lost.
. It was twenty-seven years ago that William
' . Kelly Learned that a large estate had been be
queathed to his (William's) oldest child, by his
_ brother .Peter. After Peter's death it appears
â  that a will v, a* found bequeathing all nis prop
erty: to'.tjie oldest child oi his brother. William
â¢ Keoy was a'-workinKman. His wages were suf
â¢ . iicient for tlie moderate wants himself, his
wife and children, and he was contented with
.his : k>f. It is said. io be a fact that when Kelly
first learned of the vast estate he made no effort
to secure it.for his daughter.
Two years ago he engaged an attorney and
. â' through nil efforts the vast legacy, it is said,
will be placed at the disposal of Mr. Kelly's
"oldest child, Elizabeth Kelly. this week. A re
.; P'ortvr called on Mr. Kelly and his daughter
"â  yesterday. They were reticent, but verified
. the report that they would come into tne for
' tune. The ittiniiv' believe it will amount to
"The story told by William Kelly of
Philadelphia is acsura on the face," said
. Patrick Kelly to-night. "Is it likely that
a man. who was a poor gardener would
"., kuojrofa fortune like that and do noth
. ipg in regard to it for twenty-one years? i
. .'William Kelly is no relative of Peter
-Kelly, that was drowned. Peter was
0 my uncle and I know all his relatives,
- and I am the only one in this country. !
We all Know of old Peter's death at sea, !
but we never, dreamed that he had left a â 
fortune behind him in Australia. Had we :
known it we should have gone after it \
years ago. .The Philadelphia family has '
riorishtto.it. My idea is that William
â¢ Kelly ha* seen the estate advertised and
entered into a scheme with some one in
Australia-, and as no other heirs appeared
they. t'aVe had everything their own way.
I have retained Attorney W. J. Donovan, i
â¢ and he is. in correspondence with Phila
delphia and the family in Ireland, and we'
. thick that our proofs will be perfect. In a
few days we exDect to have something
. definite about bringing a suit in Philadel

A Cigarette Victim's Widow.
OAKLAND* CaI., April I.â Two months

' .'Â» Officer Phillips, who arrested the pretty

band.Mrs. Higgins has been going steadily
down - bill. From drinking she drifted
gradually to evil companions and is now
the associate of the worst characters in the
city.
What makes the case of Mrs. Higgins
particularly sad is that she is a young
woman of good family and has married
sisters living in San Francisco who would
do anything in the world for her, but since

MAY SHOOT ONCE MORE
Some Talk Over the Recent
Police Match Across the
Bay.
An Oakland Officer Answers Some
Charges Which Were
Made.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 31.â There is
war between the Oakland and San Fran
cisco police departments, and it is all over
a story ;hat appeared in to-day's Call.
' Several statements made by members of
the San Francisco force are denied by the
Oakland men and there is no doubt that
the butts at Shell Mound will soon witness
another match between the bobbies.
"Whoever supplied those facts across the
bay did not know what he was talking
about," said Detective Nick Williams to
night. "The trouble is all caused by the i
south-of-Market-street squad because they j
were not in the mate!). They are trying i
to ridicule Captain Wittman's team, but j
we are just as ready to meet another team
from the other division. It says that four ;
of our team were in the Carson Guards at
the time they were beaten by the old
timers, wuh whom was Captain Douglass. ';
This is false, not one of our team <
having ever been in the Carson j
Guard. Then it goes on to say that
the old-timers P. D. Linville, Charley !
Na~h. Harry Hook, > T els and Andy Field,
Bixley, George Gan, Cailleau, E. C. Wells,
! J. C. Lane, Bodwell, Hiram A. Robinson, j
| John Glanz, Bailey, Clark, Oaks Erskiue j
and the old veteran Captain Douglass '
were never beaten. This is not so. About '
thirteen years ago a team from the Pacific j
Rifle Club consisting of shots from both !
sides of the bay beat them at Shell Mound, i
Myself. Colonel McKillican and Sheldon I.
Kellogg of this City were in the Pacific
team and we beat the old-timers at 200 and :
s<jO yards, ten shots apiece. On that occa- j
sionthe boys were so badly beaten that]
Captain Douglass felt pretty bad.
"Again, they said that we are all trained
match men. With the exception of Dave
Swain and myself, not one of our team j
ever shot in a match in his life, and some
of them were five point 3 shy of what they
always accomplish at practice. We are |
certain thai the men we shot against, in- |
eluding Captain Wittman, are, every one
of them, perfect gentlemen. They took !
their defeat with the best of good feeling:, ;
and we are sure they are not doing the j
baby act now."
BEAT THE CHINESE DOG
The Animal Has Been Trained
to Annoy Queue- Wearers on
the Streets.
Officer Mcore and W. E. Logan Figure
in an Exciting Scene on
Broadway.
Oakland Office San Franxisco Call,) j
90S Broadway, March 31. f j
The Chinese dog on Broadway created Â» '
sensation to-day, and had it not been for j
Officer Moore there would either have ;
l>een a Chinaman in the Receiving Hos
pital or a dead dog on the sidewalk.
For a lone time there has been a vag- !
rant cur on Broadway whose special ob- j
ject in life seems to be to annoy Chinese, j
There is no doubt that the dog has been !
"sicked" on the queue-wearers by the j
street gamins for some time past, and now
the animal is pietty well trained.
On many occasions the dog ha 3 worried '
the Chinese, and the policeman on the j
beat has frequently been called upon to j
I protect the objects of the canine's wrath, i
[ This afternoon a Chinese named Ah '
! Quong was passing Ninth street when the
dog attacked him. The frightened Chi
nese uanced and tried to run, but the doe '
jumped at his shaking garments and ,
buried his teeth somewhere in the rear '
of Quong.
W. E. Los;an was passing, and the
Chinaman tried to divert the attention of i
the dog from his own make-up to that of i
i Mr. Lo.an. After two or three attempts j
the dog let uc of the Chinaman and rushed |
at Logan. Just as the latter was about to ,
pull a gun on the brute Officer Moore !
came up. and after a couple of smart j
ulows from his club the animal slunk
away toward Franklin street.
Tlie dog has been a nuisance for months ;
and is a terror to every Chinaman that he i
sees. It is bardljr likely that he will come
back to his oia haunts for a few days.

made most miserable by those who are
supposed to be our protectors, and finally
four of us left there this morning and have
secured quarters elsewhere. "What is more
there are others there who will follow us
in a short time."
Thus spoke one of the four when seen
by a reporter to-day. She was in a highly
indignant frame of mind regarding the
way in which she had been treated.
"Tnen upon all the other things," she
continued, "it has been told about that
we were charity boarders. The idea! We
have paid our board ever since we went
there, and paid well. It is a nice place to
live, but when you pay your bills you
expect to be allowed some privileges. It
is not at jail likely I would publish any
thing about a place where I was living, "is
it? The management is such as to require
an overhauling. Our former matron had
a daughter and knew how to treat girls.
The present matron has very peculiar
views, to say the least, regarding the sub
ject."
The trouble in the home has caused a
division among the lady managers. Bald
one of them to-tlay: "The girls came be
fore us with their complaints as a sort of a
I trial court and expected to secure some
! kind of justice. Instead they were ex
; pelled without any reference to what
others had done, wliich the girls them
selves admitted was even worse. Why,
tha Fabiola nurses were even tola to leave
the room while the others were expelled,
but they left immediately after because
they were equally guilty with the others.
"That appeared to irritate certain ones,
and these last four who left to-day were
made to feel that they were not wanted.
I know life was made miserable for them,
and can only rejoice to know that they
have left there.
"The whole story has not yet been told,
and when it is there will be a scandal that
| will stir things to the very center. I fear
it would be the downfall of the home or I
would tell it now. I ara in the minority,
however, and must await developments.
There have been nine girls who have left
the home since the trouble started, and
others are to foliow. I know of four who
have refused to enter since the trouble
arose, and others will hesitate to go there
j uutil it is settled.
Mrs. Anson Barstow, treasurer of the
association, thinks the whole thing has
been given too much publicity for a sub
ject that only affects the people who board
in the home. When seen last night ahe
said :
"The whole affair makes me laugh.
Sometime ago one of the girls had some
company, and the matron, not Knowing it,
turned the gas out in the iiall at 10 o'clock,
a rule all^ boarders know 13 strictly fol
lowed. When the young man started to
leave both were surprised to find them
selves in dark halls. The directors sat one
night until 2 o'clock in the morning listen
ing to a string of such complaints, but
decided that tne boarders had nothing to
complain of.
"Jlisfl Reta Mylott left this morning,
taking a number of the girls with her. Her
s;ster went, as she deemed it necessary so
as to keep an eye on t:.e younger sister.
Miss Mylott is a young, pretty and ex
ceedingly bright girl, and has been the pet
of the Home ever since it was opened.
She says she leaves because people outside
~ay the HonjC is a charity institution, but
it is not, as all must pay their share. Like
other young people, lull of life, she wants
excitement. Her sister, on the other hand,
did not want to leave, hut was forced to
do so that her sister should be protected.
Some time ago the girls petitioned the
directors to allow them to dance and play
cards in the home occasional*}-, but it was
refused, for fear that some of the Christian
ladies who are mtrons of the home might
be offended. We will get in as many as
leave, but we are sorry to lose those we
have. Especially is this true regarding
Miss Mylott, who is a general favorite
with all, as she is a leader among the girls
in keeping things moving."
The Misses Mylott were quite indignant
to think any one should say they left for
any reason except that, with others, they
were made to feel most uncomfortable.
Miss Reta said: "I left because things
were being made very uncomfortable, and
J
I wanted to get out before anything oc
curred that would bring disgrace on any of
the girls."
Her sister said: "I am very sorry we
did not leave the home some months ago,
as I wanted to do, but now we are away
and we will stay clear of the place, and 1
hope nothing more will be said regarding
it."
Miss Williams, the matron of the home,
refused to make any statement, saying
she was merely in charge, and all matters
of government shonld come from the direc
tors and not the matron.
PRIMARIES DEMANDED.
Alameda Republicans Will Meet To
>~ight and Oppose the Appoint
ment Plan.
ALAMEDA. Cal., April I.â A President
of the United States will be elected by the
Republican Club of this city to-night.
The members of the club are so eager for a
chance to get at the polls again that they
cannot control their enthusiasm, and that
is why a mock election has been ordered.
Every man whose name is on the roll
will be permitted to cast one ballot, on
the good old straight plan that was in
vogue before the Australians landed here
witn their blanket ballot system. Me-
Kinley is apparently a favorite candidate
with the Alameda Republicans. Other
leading candidates are Senator Perkins,
Governor Morton, Reed and John Sher
man.
It is suggested that, as the club has a
large rnembersnip and is made up largely
of men having an exceptionally good
knowledge of National political affairs,
the result of tne balloting will be a strong
suggestion of the Republican sentiment of
California.
A matter to be considered by the club at
the same meeting, and which "is regarded
as of more immediate importance than the
election, is the question of holding prim
aries. Many of the Republicans are anx
ious that the primaries be held. Conier
ence committees have been appointed, and
efforts will be made to have the primaries
on Saturday of next week.
"We should by all means hold pri
maries," said Captain E. A. yon Scbmidt
to-day, "and not permit the committee to
appoint a few men to represent us. If it
is necessary we will send a contesting del
egation to Sacramento, but we will en
deavor to bring about a reconsideration of
the action in the committee."
City Attorney Taylor is a member of the
Congressional committee. He is in favor
of holding primaries, and he says that the
reason of his voting against the primary
system was that the system had no chance
of prevailing in the committee.

ALAMEDA, Cal., April I.â Captain
Burke of the Alamoda company of the
Salvation Army is about to receive a large
tent, which is to be erected on a lot on
Central avenue, near Park street, and will
be maintained all summer as the meeting
place of the army. The Alameda con
quests have been many and conspicuous,
and the old meeting-room has been found
to be inadequate. The first meeting in the
tent will be held on the 9th. when Briga
dier Keppel and Major Halpin of head
quarters will take part. On this occasion
a farewell will be taken of Jack Frodsham,
one of the earliest converts the army made
in Alameda, who, with his family, will re
move to Washington.
A Cage Dlfimif)*ed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April I.â A long
pending case of larceny ngainst Joseph
Carreau was dismissed this morning after
three continuances had been granted.
Carreau had been arrested three months
ago at the instance of J. Krebs and charged
wit fa the theft oi iron rods from the nar
row-gauge railroad shops at Alameda
Point. The invariable return cf the con
stable has been that the complaining wit
ness could not be found, hence a dis
missal was necessary.
Aluminum Hats.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April I.â Some time
ago Cordes hose company ordered an out
fit of aluminum hats from Cambridge,
Mass. They are found to possess many
points of superior! iy over the old-style
hat, among which are lightness, non-com
bustibility and non-corrosiveness. Now
Sherman company has followed suit, and
it will not be a great while till the whole
department is similarly equipped.
Police Business.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April I.â The police
made 45 arrests during the month of
March, of Which 12 were for drunkenness,
10 for violation of city ordinances, 8 for
vagrancy, 2 each for insanity, felony, di-
turbing the peace and truancy, and 1 for
evading payment of railroad fare. During
the montli lodgings were furnished 10

is fixed to take place some time in May.

TO MAKE HIM LOOK SMALL
Mayor Davie's Dollar-Tax Levy
Must Be Spent at All
Hazard.
A POSSIBLE SURPLUS FEARED.
His Honor Makes Some Pointed Re
marks on the Financial Ability
of His Fellow Officials.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 1. j
"There is so much money in every fund
from the dollar limit that some of the city
officials are risking their necks in their
efforts to spend it and throw discredit on
my figures," said the Mayor to-day.
The cause of Mr. Davie's remark was the
opening of bids last nieht for putting a
new ventilator system in the old High
School. The bids ranged from $6526 to
$3600, and the Mayor considers it just so
much money thrown away. More than
that, he says that politics are at the bot
tom of the new ventilating scheme and
that the work is not necessary.
The city expert recently prepared a
statement of the city" finances, which
showed clearly that there is more money
left to run the city for the second half of
the fiscal year than was used in the first
six months. The figures show that $349,
--300 has been spent and $376,912 lemained.
"Now, this proves that ihe dollar limit
is enough to run tne city if a reasonable
supervision is exercised over the various
departments," said the Mayor. "Now, it
is positively funny. Of course it is not to
De thought of for a moment that a Popu
list Mayor is to be permitted by a hetero
geneous mass of politicians, most of them
incapable ofbce-bolders, to run the city on
a dollar limit without a deficit. They will
make a deficit or die in the attempt. At I
present they do not know which way to turn
to avoid a surplus. The ventilation of the
old High School is just a sample. It will
waste about $6000 that was not in the esti
mate, but of course it will go.
"Last night another absurd matter
cropped up at the board meeting that
shows how stupidly the affairs of this
city are conducted. Bids were received
for workbenches for the Manual Training
School. Now, what in the world is being
done in the present Manual Training
School? W.ould it not surely be a com
mon-sense business proposition for tha
boys to make these benches? The present
methods are childish in the extreme.
Here the Board of Works advertises for
bids for workbenches and they will cost
$24 15 each. Any person with sense would
recommend that the pupils make them.
Tnere are all the necessary tools on hand
and a few dollars' worth bf lumber is all
that is required.
"April is now here and no schools or
reading rooms have yet been closed, as
was predicted six months ago. The city
never has been so economically governed,
and there is no argument that can be
raised against the dollar limit. But there
is money on band now and of course it
must be spent. How, matters not, so
long as Davie's rinanceering is belittled."
STRIKE OF A DAY.
The Alameda County Lathers Rapidly
Win Their Fight for More
Wages.
OAKLAND, Cal., April I.â Lathers
Protective Union, No. 1 of Alameda
county, won their demand for the adoption
of a nÂ«w wage schedule to-day without
contest, as far as can be seen. The men
did not work to-day, as it had been agreed
before hand that it should be observed as
a holiday.
The union has within its ranks every
one of the thirty-seven lathers in the
county. Of the?e, ten are tirst class,
eighteen second class and nine bosses
Some month or more ago it notified all
interested that on and after April 1 the
wafje schedule would be raised so as to be:
Boss lathers, $2 a thousand ; journeymen,
$3 a day; bunch-handler.--, $1 75 per" thou
sand. Charles van Haltren says*
"We are enjoying a hoiiday to-day, and
will return to work to-morrow at the new
wages. We have no non-union men to
contend with, so every lather in the coun
ty is a member of our union. Our new
schedule of wages raises them on this side
of the bay to an equal footing with those
in San Francisco. Prospects are pood for
lots of work this summer, and with fair
prices we will get along finely. The largest

Eat on an average of 2000 a day, which will
c making $4 for the boss, of which the
workmen will get $3 under the new

our bids."

1 the struggle with* the purpose of coming
i out victors. We realize the odds we will
! have to contend against in not being in as
I good training as we might, and then the
| Stanford girls are much more experienced
: than we. At any rate we will do our best,
J since we have accepted Stanford's chal
i lenge."
Two or three of the young women have
: the appearance of being overtrained,
judging from their pallid faces and worn
expression. This may be due, however, to
; anxiety over the result of the came. Tlieir
, new costumes consist of white sweaters
and blue bloomers with gold trimmings.

ORIGIN OF THE
ROENTGEN RAYS
The Statement of Professor
Clarence L. Cory of
Berkeley.
LAW OF THE SOURCE.
Many Successful Experiments at
the Electrical Engineer
ing Laboratory.
BEFEffITE RESULTS REACHED.
Science Now Looks to California to
Solve the Problem of the Great
German Discovery.
BERKELEY, Cai.., April I.â ln regard
to the recent investigations which have
been made by Professor C. L. Cory, In
structor J. N. Le Conte and R. W. Ix>h
Figure Iâ Showing the Tnbe and Its Arrangement for Most of the Experiments Carried On by the Professors at the Uni
versity of California in Their Great Work of Determining the Origin of the Wonderful Roentgen Rays.
[Drawn from a photograph taken at the University for "The Call."]
man of tbe department of electrical engi
neering at the State University, concerning
the true source of the Roentgen rays, the
following description of their experiments
has been prepared by them for The Call:
THE SOURCE OF THE ROENTGEN BAYS.
Ever since the discovery by Professor Roent
gen that it is possible to take radiographs by
means of a Crookes tube, excited by means of
an induction coil or static machine, experi
ments have been carried on in many places to
either repeat some of Roentgen's original ex
periments, or to investigate the true nature,
action and production of the new rays. One
of the things that has especially interested the
scientific investigator has been the divergence
of opinion among, the leading scientific men
as regards the true source of the Roentgen rays.
Professor Woodward was perhaps one of the
first to eliow tbe glass vacuum envelope is not
necessarily the only source of the Roentgen
rays. By means, of his "ray lump" the rays
were generated in the aluminum side of the
tube itself. Professor Rowland and Professor
Elrhn Thomson have each published articles the
conclusions of which are that, uith the tube*
they rued, the Roentgen rays proceeded from
the acode. Professor Macfarlane in the Elec
trical World of March 14 describes some ex
periments made with a cylindrical Crookes
tube ten inches long and one and a half
inches in diameter, the cathode being the
metal disk placed in the center and the anodes
at the two ends. The results indicated that
the 'ends of the tube were the sources of the
rays. One would conclude, however, from
Protessor Macfarlane's statement that the
floreseent glass was the source of the rays.
Dr. Phillip Mills Jones of San Francisco, wno
has made a number of extended experiments
recently, came to the conclusion that the ac
tive rays came irom the anode. Another of
his conclusions was "that the X rays do not
emanate from the glass, as advanced by Roent
gen." Such was the divergence of opinion
that we began on March 23 in the electrical en
gineering laboratory of the University of Cali
fornia extended experiments with a large num
ber of differently shaped Crookes tubes
with various positions of the cathode and
anode teimlnals, with the attempt to get the
true source of the rays.
Thin pine boards % of an inch thick and hav
ing an area3x4 inches were carefully marked off
in squares of V 2 an inch on each side. Thin
wire nails were then driven upright in the
boards at the corners of the squares. These
were used as objects as in Professor Macfar
lane's experiments. The size of the plates used
were Bxlo and 5x7, to that a large tma was in

in the tube and about 1-20 of an inch in
diameter) was the source of the rays. That the
anodes themselves could not be the source of
all the rays was shown by the indistinct shad
ows of the nails, indicating that some of the
rays came from a larger area than the surfaco
of the thin wire anodes.
We next made the two end electrodes, the
cathodes and the metal disk in the center of
the anode. Radiographs were taken which
show that the source of the rays was the center
of tiie metal disk anode, the remainder of the
anode, the cathodes and the florescent glass
having no practical effect. Since the cathode
rays from the fine wire cathodes impinged on
the anode in the center and in a point, it
seemed that the mere fact of cathode rays
striking a solid made that solid a source of
Roentgen rays.
Another tube was then tried. It Is shown In
figure 1 and was used by us in connection
with E. R. Drew, instructor in the physics de
partment, in some experiments which were
carried on in our electrical engineering lab
oratory during February. The aluminum
Maltese cross is hinged so that it may be
thrown down out of the way, or made to stand
upright, so that when the small circular disk
on the small end of the tube is the cathode,
the shadow of the cross is cast on the large
end of the tube, the glass being made bril
liantly florescent except on the shaded por
tion.
In the first experiment with this tube the
aluminum cross in the center was made the
anode and the small circular disk the cathode.
The cross was made to stand in such a position
that it received directly the cathode rays. The
shadow of the cross was of course cast on the
glass end of the tube. Radiographs were then
made, plates rive by seven in size being placed
about 2>2 inches from the ends of the tube,
one plate at each end as shown in figure 1.
The result showed that the florescent glass at
the ends of the tube was a source of tho rays,
but whether the aluminum cross in the center
gave off Roentgen rays could not definitely be
decided.
We next placed an Bxlo photographic plate
under the tube, as shown in figure 1, and the
result was a very clearly defined negative. The
; distance of the plate from the axis of the tube
! was four inches and the time of exposure was
j forty minutes. Besides rhe thin boards filled
with nails, keys and coins were also placed on
the plate, with the hope that if they cast
double shadows the two sources of the rays
might be better indicated by them than the
nails.
The print clearly show.s that the aide of the
anode which was facing the cathode was the
source of the Roentgt-n rays in greatest num
ber and intensity, while the reverse side was
also the source of some of the rays, but not to
the same extent as the side facing the cathode.
The line dividing the two is blurred, as the
cross was not exactly a plane. Double shadows
of the coins and keys, as well as the nails, were
cast'from the florescent glass at the ends of the
tube, which can be seen in the negative, but
which cannot be made out from the print.
The florescent glass then was a source of the
Roentgen rays, but the number and intensity
coming therefrom are small as compared with
the metal anode. The glass, which was flores
cent, was directly in the path of the cathode
rays.
At the same time that this radiograph was
made a plate was exposed at the large end of
the tube upon which the shadow of the alumi
num cross was cast. A lead plate with a hole
three-eighths of an inch in diameter was
placed between the end of the tube and the
photographic plate, to cut off if possible any
effect trom the florescent glass. The only por
tion of the glass of the tube which could affect
the plate in the region of the hole was that
shaded by the cross. The plate indicated that
the Roentgen rays came from the reverse side
of the anode, the negative being very dark in
the center where the plate was exposed
through the hole in the lead plate. The flor
escent glass, however, which was beyond the
shading action of the aluminum cross, and,
therefore, received the cathode discharge di
rect, did have an effect on the plate, |the
shadow of thp nails near the edges of the plate
showing clearly.
Finally, to show that the anode is not neces
sarily the source of the Roentgen rays unless
it receives the cathode rays on its surface, the
experiment was tried of making the anode a
tinfoil plate pasted on the exterior of the glass
tube. Accordingly the anode was put on the
tube ordinarily shaded by the cross. The
cathode was as before the small disk electrode
in the painted end of the tube. The aluminum
cross was disconnected entirely, so that it was
neither anode nor cathode, but was placed in
such a position that it received directly
the cathode rays. Another large plate was
then exposed parallel to the axis of the
tube as in the previous exporiment when the
aluminum cross was the anode. The resulting
radiograph was a negative that shows that the
side of the aluminum cross facing the cathode
was the principal source of the rays, just as it
had been in the previous experiment. The
side of the aluminum cross facing the anode
was also a source of the rays, but the number
and intensity were less from the cathode side.
The florescent glass cast the double shadow." as
before, and perhaps to a little greater extent
than in the former care when the aluminum
cross was the anode.
A plate was then exposed to the end of the
tube, upon which had been pasted the tinfoil
on the outside, as the anode. The result indi
cates that some Roentgen rays came from the
aluminum cross, and in the central portion
passed through the tinfoil anode and the glass
of the tuoe affecting the plate.
The negative secured thus shows the radio
graph taken when the aluminum cross was
neither anode nor cathode but wcw connected
to the ground through a water pipe. The I
anode was, as before, the tinfoil plate and the j
cathode was the circular disk electrode in the
small end of the tube. The whole appearance
of the tube was changed, the shadow of the
cross on the end of the tube being much en
larged. Tno <ross was hinged on the top and
swung freely back and forth as the current was
turned on and oft. When the connection was
permanently made the cross swung over
toward the cathode a 6 if attracted toward it.
The sources of the rays when the cross was
connected to the earth seemed to "be many, al
though still the cross gave out the greater
number. The uorescent glass, however, stems

to have had a much more marked effect than
in any of the previous experiments.
Some of the most interesting experiments
were repeated with another tube, having a
platinum |disk in between the anode and ca
thode. The cathode slide of the platinum disk
seemed to still be the best source of the Roent
gen rays, while the reverse side gave |very
few, showing clearly that the platinum is
much more opaque than aluminum, just as
has been shown by many others in the ordi
nary way.
The result of the experiments so far seems to
indicate the following as regards the true
source of the Roentgen rays:
Cathode rays positively electrify any
solid upon which they Impinge, prob
ably by carrying electrified particles to
the solid. The source of the Roentgen
rays, then, is the solid upon which the
cathode ray first strikes and give* up
or partially gives up its negative charge.
A second solid behind the first may be
a source of Roentgen rays If the first
solid does not take up the entire nega
tive oharge from the cathode ray.
One of the old experiments with a Crookes
tubes is that if the shape of the cathode is such
that the cathode rays focus on any solid, such
as a platinum plate, the plate is made hot, and
if the side of the glass tube is thus exposed it 1b
melted. If a metal is used as the solid to
receive the cathode rays the number and
intensity of Roentgen rays emanating there
from are much greater than if that 60lid is
glass. Aluminum is particularly fitted for
such purposes, as it is very transparent to the
Roentgen rays. By focusing the cathode rays
on such an aluminum disk the maximum
effort would be produced and indicates how
best to make a Crookes tube for experiments
in Roentgen photography.
The Roentgen rays may therefore proceed
from the anode, the florescent glass, a discon
nected terminal or a grounded terminal, pro
vided the shape of the tube and the relative
positions of the electrodes be such that the
cathode rays impinge on the anode, glass, dis
connected or grounded terminal respectively.
That the anode, because it is the anode, may
be the source of the Roentgen rays is probable,
but the fact is that in almost every case when
the anode has been found to be the source of
the rays the shape of the tube has been such
that the cathode rays impinged directly upon
it. The use oT a disconnected terminal, even
connected to the earth as the source of the
rays, places the matter in a very different light.
The induction coil used was one made by
Mr. Lohman, a student in the electrical en
gineering department of this university, and
although of very small dimensions is capable
of giving a four and a half inch spark, the en
tire coil being immersed in boiled linseed oil.
The intermittent current was obtained by
mounting a brass disk three inches in diame
ter and one-fourth of an inch thick with
eight slots in its circumference filled with
vulcanite fiber, on the shaft of a small motor.
The duration of the make was about twice
that of the break. The number ef revolutions
per second of the motor was between twenty
and fifty, giving between 160 and 400 makes
and breaks per second. A rapid interruption
whs obtained by using a condenser in parallel
with the spark gap, and a large magnet was
used to blow out the spark. Mr. Lobman has
also constructed a Tesla coil, which we have
used with much succesÃ by connecting one
terminal of the secondary to the Crookes tube.
It should be said in conclusion that Dr.
Jones' experiments have led him to conclude
that the cathode ray impinging on a solid pro
duces the Roentgen rays, but he seems to be of
the opinion that the florescent glass can have
no effect whatever.
Our experiments are being continued with a
number of different shaped tubes. The results
so far tend to confirm the results of our earlier
work. A number of special tubes, some with
aluminum windows, are being made which,
without doubt, will make it possible to make
clear and distinct radiographs with a very
snort exposure. Clarence L. Cory,

A aeries of experiments were made to
day by Instructor Drew of the physics
department with the Crookes tube where
the only source of the Koentgen rays was
the glass of the tube itself. A very dis

ments conducted in the electrical engi
neering laboratory.
COURSING TABOOED.
Secretary Holhronk Says Sportsmen
Httve No Use for It.
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
delegatea Officer Hooper to investigate the
rumor as to the opening of a coursing
park near the Branch County Jail.
The story that John Dalton is about to
open sucn a park has taken on the color
ing that the place is to be opened within
the ingle side track. Secretary W. S. Leake
of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club contra
dicted this story to a Call reporter yester
day. "'There has never been such an
intention," said he. "In iact, there is no
place for a park, should it be desired to
open one."
Secretary Holbrook is a strong anti
coursing man. "Coursing undoubtedly
belongs in the category of unnecessary
cruelty prohibited by law," he said.
"Men have told me that a dog never
touches a hare with its teeth: that he
kills it by striking it with his nose. I
happen to know that isn't true. More
than once I have seen dogs mutilate a
rabbit while it was still alive, and L have
known the little animlas to live twenty
minutes after being caught. Genuine
snorting men say they have no use for
coursing: that it is not legitimate sport.
If a park is opened within the county
limits I will arrest ihosu concerned in it.

CALIFORNIANS ROASTED
Century Magazine Comments on
Yosemite Valley Mis
management.
RECESSION OF THE TRUST.
Tyranny and Greed of the Yosemite
Ring â Scandal of the
Situation.
The Century Magazine for April again
takes up the subject of Yosemite Valley
management by the State of California,
and advocates a surrender of the trust to
the General Government. The article in
the editorial department of the magazine
is under the heading, "Plain Words to
Californians." Following is a synopsis of
the plain talk : * .
It is announced that during the month of
May of the present year there will be held In
the city of New York a unique and significant
exposition, consisting entirely of the products
of the State of Caliiornia. But for the short
sighted and unpatriotic policy which has con
trolled its railway system California would
to-day be as well known in New York as any
State of the Middle West, and it is in keeping
with the commercial enterprise of its people
that in spite of such discouragements they
boldly undertake to send across a continent a
comprehensive exhibit of its imperial re
sources. It is a scheme in which Americans
may well take pride and to which
they will wish the widest publicity and the
highest success. From the days of the gold
hunters an air of romance and adventure has
been associated with this region us with no
other part of the country; and those especially
who have visited this wonderful aud beautiful
State, and whose imagination has been touched
by its possibilities of good to the race, can
never divest themselves of a personal interest
in anything that touches its honor or its pros
perity.
Among the exhibits a prominent place will
doubtless be given to photographs of the un
; rivaled scenery of the Yosemite Valley and its
environs, as well as of the scarcely less wonder
ful canyons of the lower Sierra. But it is cer
tain that one of the exhibits will not be a
comparative series of views of the floor of the
valley, showing it as it was and in its
various stages of deterioration through the
disastrous course of improvements which have
impaired its former beautyâ a state of affairs
which has come about in part innocently
through a lack of knowledge of the proper
method of procedure, and in part through a
strongly intrenched system of tyranny and
greed known as the Yosemite Ring.
No traveler will consider this a matter of
merely local interest. John Muir, the Alaska
and Sierra explorer, has well called the Great
Gorge the world's Yosemite Valley, and its
degradation iv any respect is as much a mat
ter of general concern an would be the deface
ment of the pyramids. In January, 1890, the
Century called general attention to the de
structive tendencies at workâ a condition of
affairs long notorious in the State.
At intervals since we have noted, the con
tinuance of the amateur system of manage
ment. That the widespread criticisms in and
out of the State have had no deterrent effect is
i evident from the observation made by Mr.
Muir during lait summer. In reading his re-
I marks it must be remembered that the valley
itsolf, which technically is held by California
in trust for public U6e, resort and recrea
tion inalienable for all time, has since
I 1890 been surrounded by a National
! park thirty-five times as largo, which has been
I under military control; and that adjoining
i this park on the south, extending along the
! range, lies the Sierra forest reserve of over
' 4,000,000 acres, which for lack of similar
I supervision is being desolated by sheep, by
i fire and by the ax, as were the environs of the
| Yosemite before the establishment of the
, National Park."
The Century then quotes the observations of
i Mr. Muir regarding the management, and
i recommending a recession of the trust. The
: magnzine, proceeding with its own comment,
Bays:
"Mr. Muir's suggestion of recession is one
that should enlist the support of every I
public - spirited Californian. It is idle
to waste time in considering the causes
of the valley's deterioration. The scandal of
of the present situation is well known. The
State accepted the trust from the Nation in
1864, but Us servants have not observed the
i fundamental condition of the ceÃsion. If the
suggestion of secession is thought humiliat- I
ing, it is not half so humiliating as the
continuation of the scandal. And why
should the suggestion be humiliating ?
Continually in every State systems of admin
istration which do not work well are being
changed. The commission system has not
worked well; whereas, side by side, the system
of National control has redeemed the National
Parkâ the very source of the Yosemite water
falls. Why should not this treasure of nature
have the same admirable protection?"
One word in conclusion: If secession is to be
accomplished at the next meeting of the Cali
fornia Legislature its advocates must organize
and bestir themselves now. If Mr. Muir is not
cordially supported in this effort to iÂ«deem the
valley, and remove, a blot upon the State, let
not Californians any longer boast of public
spirit or resent the charge of absorption in ma
terial progress.
John F. Sheehan, secretary of the
Yosemite Commission, was seen last even
ing and asked what he thought of the
proposition to surrender the trust to the
Nation. He said:
"Anything would be better than the nar
row and Etingy policy which the State is
now pursuing in appropriations for the
care of the valley. Barely enough money
is allowed to keep the bridges and trails
in passable condition. It might be to the
advantage of the State to give up the trust.
Under Government control liberal allow
ance of money might follow and much
good be accomplished."
When asked if the subject had been dis
cussed in the board, he said: "No, the
Commissioners have not talked over the
proposition, I saw the Governor yester
day, and he suggested that a full meeting
of the Ooard should be had before the an
nual meetine in the valley next June. We
have had no meetings this winter. Mr.
Field, chairman of the executive commit
tee, has been laid up for some time with a
broken leg, but he may be able to come to
his office."
JOHN LEE'S LECTURE.
Marriage Now and as It Will Be
When the State Is So
cialized.
The lecture delivered by John Lee un
der the auspices of the Liberty Branch of
the San Krancisco section of the Socialist
party at 115 Turk street last eveninc was
fairly well attended. The subject of the
lecture was "Marriage Now and Marriage
Under Socialism."
"When women give their hands to men
simply for a home and food," he said, "it
is a bargain pure and simole and interferes
with the law of natural selection. Under
socialism women would be as self-support
ing as men. and this would be entirely un
necessary. If there is any virtue in woman
suffrage it is because intelligent women
realize that their highest interest and wel
fare lie in being self-supporting.
"How can a woman who is a slave bring
anything into existence but a slave.? The
importance of socialisjn Jies mainly in
this, that it is a regeneratorâ a builder-up
as well as a tearer-down. Well-dressed
ministers of the gospel, dressed in purple
and fine linen, listen to the grand anthems
sung by full choirs, step forward and read
from pilt-edged Bibles the word of life,
and tell us how to be good. These worthy
gentlemen, however, forget that a full
stomach and a warmly clothed back are
much more conducive to righteousness
than a gnawing pain in the region of
the stomach, and a back which fails to get
into that particular current of wind re
served for the shorn lamb. They expect
us to sit on the edge of the stove that
Huntington would't steal and sing 'Praise
God from whom all blessings flow. "
Next Wednesday evening there will be a
debate between a Populist and a Socialist
on the following subject: Resolved. That
the Populist party in the United States
has the most practical platform for the
people.

LANDON NONSUITED.
The Case for Damages Against the Tal-

Terminated.'
The case of Gardner Landon against the
Tallant Banking Company to recover big
damages for alleged malicious persecution
was nonsuited yesterday morning, and so
brought to an abrupt termination.
The plaintiff's case was concluded
shortly before noon by the introduction of
a number of character witnesses.
When Mr. Monteith announced that he
would : rest, W. W. Foote moved for a non-
suit, which was briefly argued by his as-
sociate, Mr. Pringle. The grounds stated
were that no malicious intent had been
shown; that the indictments by the Grand I
Jury had been socured upon advice of the
