"STOCK JOBBING
IMPERIALISM,"
Sir William Harcourt Talks
Bluntly of Transvaal
Affairs.
ALL VERY REVOLTING.
The British South Africa Com
pany and the Raid of
Jameson.
CHAMBERLAIN SHIELDS RHODES
Harmonious Settlement of the Rights
of Uitlanders Was His Dearest
Object.
LONDON, Eng., May B.â The House of
Commons was crowded with members, and
the press and strangers' galleries were
filled with visitors to-day upon the occa
sion of the presentation of the colonial es
timates.
Sir William Harcourt, the leader of the
opposition, reminded the Government that
an inquiry had been promised with the ob
ject of ascertaining whether the British
South African Company was in the hands
of tit &nd proper persons to be intrusted
with the administration of the affairs of
the company's territory. Continuing, he
said the trial of the members of the Jo
hannesburg Reform Committee in Pretoria
had disclosed important circumstances,
and the Government now owed the coun
try an authoritative statement.
From the telegrams which bad been in
terpreted and published he declared that
it was obvious that the whoie affair had
been conducted between Johannesburg and
Cape Town by the principal and responsi
ble director of the British South African
Company.
Sir William said that the whole story
was an inexpressibly revolting, sordid and
squalid picture of stock- jobbing imperial
ism. He admitted that Mr. Chamberlain
had been surrounded by difficulties and
had shown courage and decision worthy of
his position, but the question was what
was the Government going to do.
Mr. Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary,
said the deplorable result of Jameson's
raid had been to jeopardize English pre
dominance in South Africa, and it had
â¢lÂ«o delayed the concord of the two races,
which was England's main policy. He
was convinced, he said, that there had
been faults on both sides, but until they
had got to the bottom of the matter the
Government could not properly judge tne
merits of the case. There had been fre
quent Boer invasions, he said, not merely
into territory outside of the Transvaal, but
also into British territory. Furthermore,
the Boers had shown a great want of con
sideration for the rights of Uitlanders.
Mr. Chamberlain further said a harmoni
ous settlement of the question of the
rights of the Uitlanders had long been
Mr. Rhodes' dearest object. If he could
only have found a co-worker in President
Kruger the results would have been bene
ficial in promoting . the federation of the
South African States wherein local rights
would have been fully regarded. Though
recent events had sadly interfered with
these objects, their accomplishment still
remained the Government's chief aim.
President Kruger's refusal to come to Eng
land at the Government's request to
modify the convention of 1884 has ended
the prospects of a private conference upon
the leading difficulties.
What then, be asked, ought to be 'he
right step? It had been suggestsd tnat
the Government ought to have sent an ul
timatum to President Kruger. This would
certainly have been rejected and would
have led to war. The Government, he
declared, could not think of resorting to
war in order to inforce internal reforms in
the Transvaal. This declaration was re
ceived with cries af "Hear, hear."
Mr. Chamberlain said he had not threat
ened President Kroger at all, but had
claimed the right to make friendly rep
resentations. President Kruger promised
to consider these representations and the
Governnunt awaited the fulfillment of his
promises. In the meantime he had asked
Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of Cape
Colony, to come to England, but the re
quest for him to come was not intended as
a recall. In regard to the Chartered Com
pany he said he did not dispute the au
thenticity of the cipher telegrams which
the Transvaal authorities had published,
although there were as yet no legal proofs
that they indicated complicity on the part
oi" the directors of the company. ["Hear!
hear!"] But, he continued, as regards to
the actual invasion of the Transvaal there
was reason to believe that Mr. Rhodes had
expressed his disapproval and had en
deavored to stop the raid.
Did the opposition, he asked, de
mand the punisnment of Mr. Rhodes?
Whatever may have been Mr. Rhodes' er
rors he had also rendered great service,
which could not be forgotten. Mr. Rnodes
was now deprived of power of mischief,
and the directors of the Chartered Com
pany Lad shown their confidence in him
by deferring their acceptance of his resig
nation.
Considering the disturbed state of Rho
desia and the interference of Mr. Rhodes
iv that territory he did not blame the di
rectors for their show of confidence.
[Cheers.]
The Government, he said, adhered to
their promise to make a tearching inquiry
into the action of the Chaptered Company,
but he held that such an Inquiry must not
be opened until the judfcial proceedings
connected with the Transvaal were ended.
Than he said he would proiose an inquiry
by a joint committee of botl houses.
Henry Labouchere, who L a bitter op
ponent of the British South Africa Com
pany, described the company as a gang of
shady financiers who were running a
jambling concern with the Union Jack
Ivine over it. Cecil Rhodes, ie said, bad
uttered deliberate falsehoods, basely de
ceiving Governor Robinson, an< had, when
Pime Minister of Cape Colony, disgraced
1
The San Francisco Call.
and dishonored the high tradition that
British Ministers did not make money
from their positions.
Mr. Labouchere concluded by declaring
that he regretted the decision of Mr.
Chamberlain, who was fettered by the
Cabinet. The debate was adjourned.
RESERATIONS OF THE RAID.
It Waa Intended to Start a Revolution in
tfif 'Irnnavnal.
LONDON, Eng., May B.â Tha morning
papers will give prominence to two stories
of impending revelations at Pretoria of
the Transvaal trouble. They seem to be a
rehash of the evidence given early in the
trial of the members of the Johannesburg
reform committee. The Volksstem, ac
cording to the stories, discovered that the
British South Africa Company paid
$70,000 in connection with the raid into
the Transvaal, and intended to start a
revolution.
The Times to-morrow will publish a
dispatch from Pretoria, giving further
telegrams connected with the reform
movement in Johannesburg from October
to December, but they contain nothing
that is more striking than is contained in
the cipher telegrams recently published.
One dispatch refers to Colonel Rhodes,
brother of Cecil Rhodes, drawing a draft
for Â£17,000 on the British South Africa
Company on December 20. On December
28 Dr. Harris, secretary of the company at
Cape Town, telegraphed to Dr. Jameson at
Pitsani, saying: "It is all right if you will
only wait. Captain Henry comes to you
from Colonel Rhodes to-day."
The Times t\lso publishes extracts from
Major White's notebook, which, however,
it does not verify. An entry on November
30 summarizes a dispatch from Colonel
Rhodes announcing the co-operation of a
number of wealthy persons in the move
ment and adding that all toe arrange
ments of the entire government must be
placed in the hands of Cecil Rhodes.
Other entries relate to the preparation and
payment of troops. An entry on Decem
ber 29 says: "Received a dispatch from
Colonel Rhodes to move immediately on
Johannesburg."
BERLIN, Germany, May B.â TneNeuste
Nachriehten forestalls that President Kru
ger will publish a proclamation in which
he will state that in the event of the suc
cess of the revolutionary movement in
Johannesburg Charles Leonard was to bl?
President in the new Government, Lionel
Phillips Secretary of State, and John Hays
Hammond Attorney-Genera).
LOVE LEADS TO TRAGEDY
Young Terbitt Follows His Com
mon-Law Wife and Tries
to Kill Her.
Because She Fiees With a Handsomer
Man He Seriously Stabs
Her.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 8.-Charles H.
Terbittof 128 West Thirty -fifth street went
over to Newark last night to find his com
mon-law wife, who had left him on Sun
day night. He found her and stabbed her.
He is locked up, and doctors were trying
to save the young woman's life all night.
Terbitt is 2fi years of age and is an agent
for a bicycle company in Grand street.
Last June he met Stella Downey, 19 years
of ace, and after a flirtation induced her
to take a trip to Asbury Park. When tliey
returned the pair went to live together as
man and wife. Miss Downey was an or
phan and had been living with her uncle,
Henry Downey, in Hoboken. She was a
native of Evanston, 111., and ju9t returned
from a convent at Stratford, Ont., and was
innocent of the world and its ways.
In the same house with her and Terbitt
lived Frederick West, a married man. He
became acquainted with the young woman,
and after both had disappeared on last
Sunday Terbitt learned that West had a
brother, W T illlam, Jiving in Newark. He
went over there last night, climbed the
back ier.ee, went into the house, and find
ing Stella there, drew a knife and tried to
cut her throat. He made a gash from her
left ear to the breastbone. Another lunge
drove the knife into the back of her head
an inch. The girl grasped the knife and
struggled for its possession until she broke
the blade.
Then Terbitt ran out of the house. A
boy followed him and pointed him out to
an officer, who took him in charge. Terbitt
declared that he loved the girl, and said
that when she ceased to love him he went
over to Newark to kill her. Police Surgeon
Clark took charge of the wounded girl.
The stab in the back of the head is the
most serious one. Her recovery is doubt
ful.
RAGE OF A JILTED FARMER.
Shoots a Young Woman and Her Success
ful Suitor and Then Commits
Suicide.
WILLIAMBPORT, Ind., May B.âYes
terday Charles Harrison, a young and
prosperous farmer living in the northern
part of this county, shot Ida Welch and
Harry Smith and then killed himself.
The shooting took place in the home of
Miss Welch.
Harrison and Smith were rival suitors.
Miss Welch accepted Smith. Yesterday
morning Harrison saw Smith enter the
Welch home, and knowing that Mr. and
Mrs. Welch were away, he went into the
house, got his pistol and went to the
Welch home. He was admitted by a
younger sister.
Without making any inquiry Harrison
went into the sitting-room, where Smith
and Miss Welch were engaged in a con
versation. Without a moment's warning
he opened fare, discharging three shots at
Smith and Miss Welch, who each sank to
the floor seriously injured. Thinking
that his aim had been fatal Harrison
placed the weapon to his temple and fired,
the ball taking effect in the brain, death
resulting almost instantaneously.
Smith was shot in the right breast and
his recovery is doubtful. Miss Welch was
shot in the right arm and also just above
the pit of the stomach, and while she is
resting easily the extent of her injury
has not been ascertained.
All Record* Beaten.
FOWLER, Ind., May B.â Mrs. Freitz
Heinznit, who lives about a mile north of
here, gave birth last night to six infants,
four boys and two girls. All are doing
well. Two years ago Mrs. Heinznit gave
birth to triplets.
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, MAY 9, 1896.
THAT EXPENSIVE MISFIT TARIFF.
DEMANDS THE
DEATH PENALTY.
Prosecutor Suarez Asks a
Harsh Fate for the
Filibusters.
PRISONERS ARE GUILTY.
Admit the Part They Took in Con
nection With the Schooner
Competitor.
TRIED BY A COURT-MASTIAL.
Mr. Williams, as Consul-General, Had
Entered a Protest Against the
Proceedings.
HAVANA, Cttba, May B.â At 8 o'clock
this morning a court-martial opened at the
arsenal here for the trial of the men who
were captured by a Spanish warship on
the alleged filibustering schooner Compet
itor, belonging in Key West. The prison
ers were Alfredo Laborde, born in New
Orleans, Owen Milton of Kansas, William
Kinlea, an Englishman, and Elias Bed<a
and Theodore Maza, both Cubans.
Captain Ruiz acted as president of the
court, which consisted of nine other mili
tary and naval officers. All the accused
pleaded not guilty.
Several witnesses admitted that when
the men were captured they were not
armed and offered no resistance. Despite
this fact, however, ihe prosecutor, Lieu
tenant Suarez, asked the court-martial to
convict the prisoners of filibustering and
to impose the death sentence upon all of
them.
Counsel for the defense made a long re
view of the evidence, and demanded the
acquittal of Maza. He argued eloquently
against the others being sentenced to
death, and declared that the evidence
showed that mercy should be extended to
them.
Tne court-martial has as yet rendered
no judgment. It is said its findings will
be submitted for approval to the Govern
ment at Madrid.
During the course of the proceedings a
letter was read from the American Consul-
General, Ramon O. Williams, protesting I
against the trial. Mr. Williams abstained i
from attending the court-martial.
General Linares reports that his com
mand has succeeded in dislodging the
fo;ces of Jose Maceo from the entrenched
camp occupied by them in ths province of
Santiago de Cuba. In the rightim* that
took place before the rebels retreated
seventeen of the insurgents were killed.
The troops, according to the report, lost
only two killed and seven wounded.
Another official report issued to-day
states that the com Dined forces of Generals
Altamira and Inclan have driven the reb
els under Antonio Maceo into a different
position in the hills at Guaramaya, near j
Bahia Honda, province of Pinar del Rio.
The report makes no mention of any rebel
loss, but states that the Spaniards had
seven killed and twenty-five wounded.
Among the latter are one captain and two
lieutenants.
The rebel bands of Regino and Alfonso
have burned abo-.t sixty house* in the
town of Lagunillas, province of Matanzas.
ERCAPAD THE WARSHIP.
Arm* 'and â¢ Ammunition " Safely Landed
' ' by the B+rmudm. â¢' ! 'â¢â¢ * <â 
â¢ PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May â¢ iâWord
was received here this afternoon of the ar
rival at Trujillo of the j steamer Bermuda.
She merely touched there and then cleared
for Puerto Cortez, ; Honduras, where she is
expected to drop anchor in the course of a
day or two.
The Bermuda, after clearing from Phila
delphia, sailed from Jacksonville, FJa., on
April 26, presumably with a cargo of arms
and ammunition for the Cuban insurgents.
Her arrival at Trujillo indicates that she
escaped from the Spanish war vessel which
it was reported had chased her. it is be
lieved that the arms and ammunition were
safely landed. , .

Include the Retirement of
Kutz.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â Several
important chances in the duties of naval
officers were made at the Navy Depart
ment to-day. Rear- Admiral W.H. Kirk
land, now on waiting orders, was directed
to assume command of the Mare Island
Navy-yard, California.
Captain H. L. Howison was detached
from the command of the Mare Island
Navy-yard and ordered to special duty in
connection with the new battleship Ore
gon, with a view to being placed in com
mand of that vessel.
Commander O. W. Farenholt was de
tached from bis duty as an inspector of
the Thirteenth District, Portland, Or., and

partment concerning a deposit of $2500
said to have been given in his care as
surety for Mr. Tobin, his clerk, was de
tached from the Concord to-day and
granted two months' leave. This indicates
that Paymaster Webster is free from any
displeasure of the department, and that if
an allegation concerning Tobin's collateral

BEEF TRUST INVESTIGATION.
Mo One Indicted by the Chicago Grand Jury
Because Witnesses Were
Lacking.
CHICAGO, 111 , May B.â The beef trust
railroad investigation by the Federal
Grand Jury came to an end to-day, so far
as the existing jury is concerned. It may
come up again before the October jury or
before a special jury if the emergency war
rants such extraordinary action on the
part of the Government. The District
Attorney and his special counsel could not
indict anybody without more witnesses
than they had been able to attach with a
subpena. The special jury may be called
in case the much-wanted eight witnesses
from the stockyards and railroad offices
return within the jurisdiction of a United
States writ. An investigation of railroad
rate-making at the instance of the Com
merce Commission depends upon the rail
road officials' future compliance with the
aw.
SUICIDE OF A WOMAN,
Shot Herself in a Room at the
Colonnade Hotel in New
York.
Left a Note Saying That Insanity-
Was Hereditary and That She
Had No Relatives.
NEW YORK, N. V., May B.â A hand
some, well-dressed woman, about 28 years
old, who registered at the Colonnade
Hotel, 38 Lafayette place, Wednesday aft
ernoon, as Mrs. Everett of Boston, shot
herself in her room to-day. The bullet en
tered her head through her left ear. She
was found dead in bed fully dressed. She
left the following note unsigned and not
addressed to anybody :
"Hereditary insanity. Please cremate
and pay landlord for damages, etc. Have
no family, so beg that my wishes be ob-
Berved."
The letter was in a hotel envelope, in
which also was $89 in bills. The woman's
clothing was of the finest quality. The
neck of her dress was caught by a gold and
enameled brooch studded with nine
diamonds. She wore two plain gold rings
on the little finger of the right hand, one
wedding-ring. On an undergarment were
the initials "K. B." Her eyes and hair
are jet black.

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
TRAGIC DEATH
OF A BIGAMIST,
J. F. Mitchell, a West Point
Miner, Killed by His
Mother-in-Law.
IS RIDDLED WITH SHOT.
The Theft of Money Followed
by a Most Sensational
Homicide.
SYMPATHY FOR THE WOMAN.
Her Victim Had a Wife From Sonoma
When Compelled to Wed a
Second Time.
BAN ANDREAS, Cal., May B.â Meager
details of a fatal shooting affair which,
occurred at West Point yesterday reached
here to-day. The principals of the affair
were Mrs. C. Halladay and her son-in-law,
F. J. Mitchell, alias Prewick. A bad feel
ing has existed between the two for some
time past and it ended yesterday by the
mother-in-lhw killing the man.
As near as can be learned the trouble
was brought about by Mitchell taking a
sum of money belonging to Mrs, Halla
dcy in the morning prior to his gome to
work. When the woman learned of her
loss she determined to recover the coin,
and seizing a double-barreled shotgun
started for the Granite mine, where
Mitchell was at work. Reaching the place
she sought Mitchell and demanded the re
turn of the money.
Mitchell promptly handed over the
money. When the woman had it she
offered him one-half the amount if he
would leave the country and never return.
Michell thought he saw a chance to get it
all and made a grab for the gun.
Mrs. Halladay got it first and turning
the muzzle toward him, pulled the trig
gers, sending both charges of shot into his
body and killing him insiantly.
So far as known the woman has not yet
been arrested, and- it is hardly probable
that she will be. Sympathy seems to be
on her side, &t, Mitchell was a worthless
fellow.
The first trouble between them wai
caused about a year ago, when Mitchell
commenced making love to Viola beck,
Mrs. Halladny's daughter. The old lady
objected to him. One day she discovered
the couple in a room in a hotel and she
then resolved that he should marry the
daughter. She accordingly brought the
couple to this place to have the ceremony
performed. Wnile at the clerk's office get
ting the license she was compelled to step
out to get the Justice. Before leaving she
told the clerk not to let Mitchell get away
and to watch him close as he was a slip
pery fellow.
When the couhle were married she left
for San Francisco. Here Mitchell met a
woman who claimed to be his wife, and
promptly bad him arrested on a charge of
bigamy. It seems that prior to coming to
Calaveras he was married in Marin County,
where he Dyed under the name of Tre
wick. At his examination he was bound
over to appear before the Superior Court.
When this trial came up the Judge dis
missed him, claiming the case was out of
his jurisdiction, one marriage having been
performed in Marin County and the other
in Calaveras. While Mitchell was await
ing trial his wife worked in a hotel in the
city, but was takeu sick, and her mother
went down and brought her up to We3t
Point. As soon as Mitchell was released
he returned to her, and has been living
there since. Part of the lime he worked,
but the major part did nothing. He was
about 35 years old.
GALA DAY AT FFRENDALE.
\ Magnificent I'ythian Cattle Dedicated
With Impreaai** Cerenioniea.
FERNDALE. Cal., May B.â This was a
gala day at Ferndale. The magnificent
castle of Aurora Lodge No. 51, Knights of
Pythias, erected at a cost of many thou
sands of dollars, and the most magnificent
structure in Northern California, was dedi
cated to-day in accordance with Pythian
ceremonies. The town was exquisitely dec
orated with the triple colors of the order.
Every lodge m Humboldt of this order was
in the line of parade, and thousands of
people were present. Enthusiasm and en
joyment characterized every feature. The
parade and dedication ceremonies were
never surpassed in the State. Headed by
the Ferndale band and the uniform rank
delegations of all lodges in the county, the
procession was very imposing. The dedi
cation services, under the direction of Col
onel J. H. Gysler, were the most impressive
ever listened to in this section. -The ad
dress oi welcome by S. D. O'Neii, and the
reply by A. J. Monroe were good. F. A.
Cutler, in an elequent speech on the prin
ciples of the order, told the lessons of the
glorious trinity of principle of friendship,
charity and benevolence. He dwelt clearly
upon the origin, growth and development
of the order, its past and its achievements.
State Senator Frank McGowan, supreme
representative of the Knights of Pythias
concluded ti-e exercises with one of theme
masterly addresses characteristic of the
ability of that ceiebrated orator. He dwelt
upon the great institution of Pythianhood
as one of American origin, created and
founded at a time when internal strife rent
this country in war and the necessity of an
order for fraternal feelings. He snowed
that the primary principles of the order
was devotion to a democratic form of gov
ernment, and gave incidents of Pythian
martyrdoms to friendship.
Dog Mangles a Grata Valley Child.
GRASS VALLEY, Cal., May B.â This
morning a large Newfoundland dog at
tacked the four-year-old child of W. N.
Webber, who lives at Indian Springs, ten
mites from Grass Valley, and fearfully
mutilated the face of the child. The
youngster had been in the habit of play
ing with the dog and was engaged in such
pastime when the brute suddenly sprang
at him and caught the right eye and
cheek of the child and chewed away until
the dog' 3 teeth met. The sight of the ey*

CONFERENCE OF
THE METHODISTS,
Rights of Women Delegates
Yet a Subject of
Debate.
EXCITEMENT PREVAILS.
Quite a Storm Caused by the
Introduction of a Resolution
to Pay Their Expenses.
PKOGEESS OF MISSIONARY WORK
Encouraging Reports Made in Refer
ence to Africa, India and
Asia.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 8. â The
meeting of the General Conference of the
Methodist church this morning wÂ»s ex
citing. Morris Sharp of Ohio opened up
the woman question by offering a resolu
tion providing that as the women dele
gates elected to this conference had relin
quished their seats that their expenses be
paid, and that their mule reserves, ii any,
be called.
Rev. Dr. Leonard made a fervid speech
against the passage of the resolution.
"These women, it has been decided," he
said, "are legal members of this body, and
as such their expenses must be paid with
out any resolution. I hope the conference
will vote this resolution down."
Great excitement prevailed and many
delegates struggled to get the floor. An
attempt to lay the resolution on the table
was defeated.
Rev. Dr. Neeley of Philadelphia offered
a substitute for the resolution asking that
the women delegates who had claimed the
right of admission to the conference come
to the floor as visitors and that their ex
penses be paid by the committee.
Then followed the greatest excitement
of the conference. F very body was ex
cited and a dozen angry delegates in all
parts of the house were vainly trying to
get tbe floor. During the confusion both
resolutions were withdrawn and the inci
dent closed.
Bishop Taylor, the missionary Bishop
from Africa, delivered hia report. In part
he sa id :
"All I ask for Africa is that in our mis
sionary work we do for the blacks what we
would Jo for the whites. In regard|to our
work in Africa I will gay that if this con
ference shall decide that the time hascoine
to put all the African missions under the
control of the missionary society I shall
make no objection; only make your deci
sion on the subject decisive."
Bishop Thoburn of India and Asia read
his report. He said:
"In general terms we have abundant
reason to thank God for our prosperity
during the last four years. We have
pained two annual conferences and eleven
presiding eider districts. We now have
twenty-four district conferences; our
preachers now speak sixteen languages,
three more than four years ago, and by
the end of the century tliey may be
expected to preach in twenty languages,
lour years ago our total number of con
verts was 50,000 souls, now it is over
100,000. We now have 2249 Sunday-schools
and llfido scholars, an increase of 873
schools and 21,712 pupils. The Epworth
League has made ita first appearance
among us since my last report and we now
have 134 leagues and 6555 members. We
have over 200 natives studying for the
ministry."
Alter the long wrangle all reference to
the debate on the woman question was
or.tered stricken from the record.
Friday, May 15, was set apart for "Mem
orial day". Resolutions were adopted
commending the action of Congress in
cutting off aid from sectarian schools. A
resolution asking the Government to grant
belligerent rights to the Cubans was
referred without debate to the committee
on the state of the church. The confer
ence then adjourned.
The evening session at the armory was
devoted to the educational anniversitiesof
the Methodist church. The laymen also
held a meeting, the purpose of which was
to device means to cut down the authority
of the Bishops and ministers. There were
sixty-two delegates out of the 200 in the
conference present. They wrangled all
the evening, but arrived at no definite
conclusion.

FARMER MORPUN'S SEEDS.
There May Tet Be a Scandal in the Dis
tribution.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 8. -A Sun
special from Washington says: The Senate
has passed a resolution directing tbe Sec
retary of Agriculture to make haste in
distributing seeds to tbe rural constituents
of Congressmen. In the opinion of those
who have knowledge of tbe subject a pub
lic scandal is likely to develop in connec
tion with this year's free-teed distribution.
Secretary Morton cannot personally re
spond to the order of the Senate, as he has
gone for a month's jaunt to the Pacific
Coast, but bis department may be called
upon to explain some very peculiar trans
actions in which some members of Con
gress may be unpleasantly involved.
The firm receiving the contract was able
to bid a lower price because of the adver
tisement it received by being allowed to
put its name on each package. Not con
tent with this, it is now offering to put up
seeds in exactly the Bame style of pack
ages as the Government seed and supply
Congressmen at the rate of $6 a thousand
packages. Other firms are also making
the same offers, notwithstanding a notice
from the Secretary of Agriculture that
such proceedings will not be permitted.
STRIKE IN THE RACES MINE.
-><â¢Â«â¢ Men Are Jtriven Out and Serious
Trouble Is feared.
BUTTE, Mom., May B.â Serious trouble
is likely to result over the strike in tbe
Rarus mine. The men did not like Time
keeper Applegate, and demanded his re
moval, which Manager Faugheinz granted,
but expressed the opinion that the shift
bosses were to blame, whereupon Superin
tendent Rowe and the bosses resigned;
l'sO miners quit work out of sympathy.
New men went to take the places of the
strikers this morning, but the latter met
them and drove them down the bill with
threats of violence. Givens, the new
superintendent, has been threatened with
hanging, and serious trouble is feared.
There is talk about calling out the militia.
The Miners' Union refuses to recognize
the strike.
Fxeeuted for Murder.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., May B.â John
Waldrop was hanged in the County Jail
here at 11:10 o'clock this morning. Only
two dozen witnesses, chiefly deputies,
were present. Waldrop was convicted of
the murder of Alexander Thornton in the
mines at Ooalsburpr four months apo.
Both men were convicts serving terms for
larceny.
NEW SCHEDULE OF RATES
According to the Terms All the
Lines May Carry Grain
to the Gulf.
Reduced Fares During the Civil
Engineers' Convention in
San Francisco.
CHICAGO. 111., May B.â After numer
ous meetings in this city and Bt. Louis,
and after an arbitrator's award had been
prepared only to be ignored, a schedule of
rates satisfactory to all lines was com
pleted to-day on export grain from Kansas
points to Galveston and New Orleans.
The Missouri Pacific was the road which
refused to abide by the award, because it
imposed higher rates for it out of Wichita
than was allowed the Santa Fe to the Gulf
ports. The new management closely fol
lows the lines of the award, but so modi
fied that equitable rates for all lines from
all points are preserved, and no line will
be compelled to go out of the i<rain carry
ing business southwest. This trouble had
disturbed the freight situation in the
whole of that territory.
The permanent code of rules for the
governing of the Central Passenger Com
mute, which goes into effect on June 1,
provides for a money penalty to be paid
by order of Commissioner Donald by vio
lators of the agreement, the fine to vary
according to the enormity of the infrac
tion. The passage of a law by the Ohio
Legislature prohibiting railroads making a
charge for the transportation of bicycles
in baegaue-cars prevented any definite ac
tion being taken by the committee on that
question. The Ohio roads, with one ex
ception, declared their intention of obey
ing the law, but the dissenting official said
the law was a farce because there was no
penalty clause, and saW his road would
ignore it. Most of the roads will continue
charging for bicycles outside of Ohio.
Th<Â» Southern Pacific gave notice to-day
that it would make reduced rates for the
American Society of Civil Engineers' Con
vention in San Francisco June 30, inde
pendent of the refusal of the Transconti
nental Passenger Association and us chair
man to give the road such authority. The
Union Pacific at once gave notice that it
would meet the rates, and all other com
petitors have been authorized to do like
wise. The rates provide for a 60-day re
turn limit, thus providing a cheap excur
sion to the coast on all lines during the
summer.

OUTER AND INNER HARBORS.
All Other Questions in the Appro*
priation Bil. Have Been Disposed
Of by the Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 8.-Among
the dozen or more bills which were passed
by the Senate to-day because they were
unobjected to was one permitting the
erection in Washington of a monument in
honor of Samuel Hahnemann, the founder
of the Medical School of Homeopathy,
and appropriating $14,000 to defray the
cost of the foundation. Tbe only restric
tion imposed in the bill is that the monu
ment is not to be placed in the Capitol
grounds. The consideration of the river
and harbor bill was concluded with the
exception of one amendment involving
the bitterly contested question of the loca
tion of a deep-water harbor in Southern
California. The Committee on Commerce
reported an amendment to the bill pro
viding for a breakwater and outer harbor
at Santa Monica, while the two Senators
from California, and McLachlan, the Rep
resentative from Los Angeles district, op
posed that location and favored the selec
tion of San Pedro, having on their side of
the question the representatives of the
two boards of army engineers, especially
sent|out to examine the matter.
Senator White of California addressed
the Senate in opposition to the committee
amendment and bad not finished his argu
ment when the Senate at 5:15 p. m. ad
journed until to-morrow.
The Senate bill authorizing the Sioux
City and Omaha Railway Company to
construct and operate a railway through
the Omaha and Winnebago Reservation
in Thurston County, Nebr., wa3 taken
from the calendar and passed.
A bill to prohibit the issue of United
Btates bonds without the authority of
Cungress was introduced by Bacon (D. ) of
Georgia and laid on tbe table for the pres
ent, Bacon stating that he desired here
after to address the Senate upon it.
Mitchell (R.) of Oregon gave notice that
on tbe passage of the last of the appropria
tion bills he would move to proceed to
the consideration of the joint resolution
for an amendment to the constitution pro
viding for the popular election of United
States Senators.
The river and harbor bill was then
taken up, the paragraph appropriating
$50,000 for the protection from erosion of
the east bank of the Mississippi River
along and in front of Sny Island levee in
Illinois coming first for consideration.
After argument against the Senate
amendment by Palmer (D.) of Illinois,
and in support of it by Vest (D.) of Mis
souii, the item was modified so as to read:
"For the protection from erosion, etc.,
and for the improvement and maintenance
of the channel of the river by revetment
work, or otherwise, such amounts as may
be necessary in the opinion of the Secre
tary of War."
In the paragraph for improving the
upper Missouri River the appropriation of
$10,000 for work at Sioux City, lowa, was
on motion of Allen (P.) of Nebraska in
creased to $50,000.
The committee amendment, which di
rects that all persons employed on the
public works of engineering intrusted to
the engineer department, shall be selected
and hired by the officer of the corps of
engineers in local charge of the works,
gave rise to a discussion involving the
question of civil service reform and the
President's recent order of extension.
After some discussion a point of order
was sustained, and the amendment was
stricken out of the bill.
All the committee amendments having
been disposed of except that as to the deep
water harbor in Southern California, the
bill was open to amendments of individual
Senators. Among those that were offered
and agreed to were the following: By
Gray (D.) of Delaware, to permit army
officers on the retired list to engage in
river and harbor work.
By Carter (R.) of Montana, to allow
persons or corporations to construct, sub
ject to conditions by the Secretary of War,
a dam or dams across the upper Missouri
River at Stubbs Ferry, Montana, to de
velop water power.
By Lodge (R.) of Massachusetts appro
priating $5000 for survey of Portland chan
nel, Alaska.
The committee amendment as to the
deep-water harbor in Southern California
was then taken up. It provides for a break
water at Port Los Angeles, in Santa
Monica Bay and authorizes contracts to
the amount of $2,998,000 exclusive of
amounts heretofore appropriated.
White (D.) of California moved to sub
stitute for the committee amendment a
provision for the appointment of a board
to select a proper location for the deep-sea
harbor â the board to consist of a naval
officer with rank as high as commander,
an engineer army officer and a member of
the coast and geodetic survey â the appro
priation and contracts to be Â«pplied to
the point selected. This amendment was
offered in the interest of San Pedro, the
competing point.
With two diagrams arranged on easels
of the two areas White pointed out the
advantages which he claimed for San
Pedro over Santa Monica. The question,
he said, was of great local impoitance to
those whom he in part represented and was
of great National importance. The inner
harbor at San Pearo had been, he said,
quite a success. Some years ago, when
the Government engineers took charge of
the work, there was but two feet of water
there at low tide. Now there were four
teen at low and nineteen at nigh tide, so
that vessels drawing eighteen feet of water
could pass into the inner harbor at high
tide. The plan for a breakwater was in
tended to let in all tbe vessels that came
there. There were two questions in
volvedâfirst, should there be an outer
harbor at all? and second, should the
outer harbor be at San Pedro or at Santa
Monica?
White gave the history of the two towns.
Ban Pedro had been in the past used by
navigators for landing purposes. It was
called the embarcadero. Through it the
small commerce of that time had been
transacted. But the population of Los
Angeles had grown from 11,000 in 1880 to
about 100,000 now, and the demand for
better water facilities grew. Some years
ago the Senator from Nevada (Jones) built
a railroad from Los Angeles to Santa
Monica, with the intentton of extending it
to Salt Lake, but that road had fallen into
the hands of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, which built an expensive wharf at
Santa Monica. Under the influence of the
Senator from Maine (Frye), then, as now,
chairman of the Committee on Commerce,
who had the opinion that San Pedro was
not the better place for the harbor, a sec
ond commission of army engineer officers
(known as the Craighill board) was ap
pointed to examine the question. That
board had before it the report of the Men
dell board and held public meetings in Los
Angeles, where it heard the arguments of
business men and of experts. There were
then three places competing for the loca
tion of the deep-sea harbor â Redondo,
Santa Monica and San Pedro.
That board filed a report favoring the
location at San Pedro, as the Mendell
board had previously done. When its re
port came before Congress no action was
taken. It was not satisfactory to the advo
cates of the Santa Monica proposition.
White quoted from the minority report
of the Committee on Commerce (Bigned by
himself and Senators Berry, Caffery and
Pasco), stating that the committee amend
ment had not been inserted at the instiga
tion of the Senators from California, or of
the Representative of that district. On
the contrary, they had objected to it and
the overwhelming sentiment of the com
munity was against iT. It would be rather
singular, White said, that Congress should
find it necessary to make an appropriation
of public money in the face of the desire
of the local Representatives and of o^cial
recomrneudation. It was utterly impos
sible that such a condition of things could
ever exist until there was some extraordi
nary influence brought to bear. This "ex
traordinary influence" White subsequently
indicated as the "potential persistency of
the Southern Pacific Railway Company."
While some States were forced to solicit
appropriations for public causes Califor
nia found itself specially favored by the
Senate Committee on Commerce, for in
th is case the large appropriation for an
outer harbor at Santa Monica was not
only unsolicited but unwanted. He op
posed the committee amendment because
he did not feel authorized to vote one cent
of money unless be believed it to be for a
public purpose and for the public interest.
He did not hesitate to assert as between
the locations of Sau Pedro and Santa Mon
ica, if the people of that section were per
mitted to make a choice, there would be
an overwhelming vote in favor of San Pe
dro. But there were those wno thought
tnat under prevailing conditions they
could never have what they wanted and
that they had better accept the situation
such as they thought it was without fur
ther contest and worry. THat situation
could not affect him. It should affect no
body. Tne question before the Senate was
where the money should be expended, if it
was to be expended at all.
White dissected the statement made be
fore the committee by Mr. Cothell, a civil
engineer â the drift oi his remarks being
that Mr. Cothell represented Mr. Hunting
ton and the Southern Pacific, and had not
acted in an official capacity, as he inti
mated he had done. The Senate Commit
tee on Commerce, White said, had set
aside the views and recommendations of
the army engineers, with General Craig
hill as their head, and had taken the opin
ions of Mr. Hood, the chief c ngineer of the
Southern I'acinc, and of Mr. Cothell, an
engineer in the employment of that com
pany, and ha i adopted the views of those
who were personally and financially inter
ested iv favor of Santa Monica.
George (D.) of Mississippiâ ls there no
other professional statement in favor of
Santa Monica than that of the engineers
of the Suuthern Pacific?
Whiteâ None on earth. Not only that,
but the committee recommends $3,098,000
for this improvement while there is no of
ficial estimate of the cost and no official
recommendation for it.
"Is it a fact," George asked, "that two
boards of army engineers have reported
against the location for which the appro
priation is to be made?"
''Yes, sir," White replied.
"Is it a fact," pursued George, "that
there is no other evidence on which the
Senate is asked to act. except the state
ments of two men who aie in the employ
ment of the Southern Pacific Company ?"
"To be fair," White answered, "I will
say that there is other evidence. Gentle
men testified before the committee and, in
addition to that, there is personal knowl
edge on the part of the chairman of the
committee (Frye) and some members of it
who have seen the localities and formed
their views."
Bates (D.) of Tennessee inquired about
the views of the commercial boards at Los
Angeles; but before White could make a
full reply he pleaded indisposition, and
asked to have the matter go over till to
morrow.
The request was complied with, and the
Senate at 5:15 adjourned until to-morrow.
CLERKS FOR CONGRESSMEN.
Members of the Bouse Placed on Equal-
ity With Senator*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â After
several years' discussion and as many un
successful attempts, members of the
House to-day votedâ l3o- to 108â to place
themselves on an equality with the Sen
ate in respect to the matter of providing
themselves with clerks the year round in
stead of for the sessions of Congress only.
It was not until 1393 that the House went
even so far as that. To-day's action was
preceded by an animated debate of an hour
or more, in which a dozen members took
part.
The principal opposition to the resolu
tion introduced by Hartman (R.) of Mon
tana and reported by the Committee on
Accounts without recommendation, was
upon the ground that tne treasury was not
in a condition to meet the increased ex
pense, but two or three members suggested
that the service of clerks were not needed.
The resolution was warmly advocated by
Hartman and Henderson (11.) of lowa.
Before being heard the resolution was
amended so as to exclude Representatives
who are chairmen of committees having
usual clerks.
Among the bills passed during the ses
were the following: To quiet title of cer
tain bona-tide purchasers of public lands;
to quiet titles to lands in Aredondo trrant,
Columbia County, Georgia; authorizing
the construction of life-saving stations at
Point Bonlta, Cal., and Port Huron, Mich. ;
appropriating $5000 to enable the President
to deport about 500 Indians in Montana
to the border and to deliver them to the
Canadian authorities; also twenty-four
private pension bills.
At 4:20 o'clock the House took a recess
until 8 o'clock, tiie evening session to be
for the consideration of private pension
bills.
At the evening session nearly an hour
was spent discussing the bill to pension
the widow of General Thomas Ewing. The
bill passed the Senate carrying $100 a
month and the Committee on Invalid Pen
sions recommended that it be reduced to
$76. Talbert m>ved to farther reduce it to
$50, and on that motion the whole question
of pensioning officers' widows was dis
cussed with much vigor. On a division
the motion of Talbert was agreed to â ayes
63, noes 60, but on a vote by tellers it was
rejectedâ 67 to 58. The committee amend
ment fixing the amount at ~575 was then
agreed to.
During the evening twenty-eight bills
were favorably acted upon, this being
seven more than the previous high record
established at a Friday night session in
this Congress. These, together with the
seventy-two bills considered at Wednes
day's session, were reported to the House
by Chairman Hepburn, and they all go on
the calendar.
Among the bills acted upon were the
following: To grant a pension of $75 a
month to Mrs. Mary Gould Carr, widow of
the late General Joseph B. Carr; to grant
a pension of $30 a month to Mrs. Helena
Funkhouser, widow of Colonel Funk
houser of the Nineteenth Illinois In
fantry.
At 10:30 o'clocK the House adjourned
until Monday.
CONTRACTS FOR ARMOR.
A Recommendation That Awards Be
Divided Between Companies. '
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â Captain
Sampson, chief of the Naval Bureau of
Ordnance, has recommended to Secretary
Herbert that the contracts for the armor
intended for the battle-ships Kearsarge
and Kentucky be divided between the two
bidders, the Carnegie Steel Company of
Pittsburg and the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany of the Bethlehem, Pa., the former
being given the manufacture of 3007 tons
, and the latter 2653. The division was made
on the basis of the bids in the separate
exhibit.
Each exhibit, and the bid* of both com
panies thereon, were compared, and the
iimi making the lowest proposal was rec
ommended the award in that particular
class. The amount of the Carnegie con
tract will be 11,660,518 20, and that of the
Bethlehem $1,462,191 80, a total of $3,122,
-710. Secretary Herbert has the privilege
of accepting or rejecting the recommenda
tion.
Condition of the Treasury.
WASHINGTON, D. C. May 8. â The
treasury gold reserve at the close of busi
ness to-day stood at $117,656,614. The
day's withdrawals amounted to $1,154,100.
CIVIL SERVICE EXTENDED.
Thirty Thousand Government
Employes Are Added to the
Classified List.
All Are Now Responsible to the
Commission for Appointments
and Changes.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â The
President has by his signature extended
the provisions ef the civil service law to
30,000 Government employes, increasing
the number of positions on the classified
list from 55,736 to 85,135, and with a few
minor exceptions between tbe extremes of
officials whose confirmation by the Senate
is constitutionally requisite, down to mere
laborers and workmen. Government ap
pointments are withdrawn as far as possi
ble from political influence and protected
in their tenure of office j the merit
system.
The President's signature yesterday
canceling all former orders issued
and substituting the new rules was
immediately tiled in the State Department
and went into effect at once, thus fore
stalling any possible action throughout
the country by appointing: officials or
transferring employes or in any other way
evading the rules before being formally
notified of them. From tbe moment of
its signature the new order made all Gov
ernment officials directly responsible to
the commission for appointments and
changes.
This revision of the rules divides
the executive, civil service into five
branches as follows: The departmental
service, the customhouse service, the post
office service, the Government printing
service auc the interna revenue service.

HUNTINGTON IS
OUT OF POLITICS:
Not Even Interested in the
Late Sacramento Con
vention.
ANTI-FUNDING PLANK.
Now Admits That the People
of California Are Seeking
Foreclosure.
ALL ARE JOINED AGAINST HIM.
Rather Peculiar Change of Views
. Since He Was Before the Sen
ate Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â C. P.
Huntington breaks into the Post's news
columns this rooming to inform Wash
ington people that he is "out of politics."
He was asked if he had read the dispatch
from Sacramento.
"Did you expect the convention would
instruct for McKinley?"
"Really I had not thought much about
it. lam not in politics and am not watch
ing these matters; in fact, I am doing
what I can to keep tbe railroad which I
in part control so far out of politics that
no one can justly accuse the company of
interfering in such matters. When nomi
nations are all made I shall then judge for
myself which is best."
"I notice they adopted an anti-funding
resolution?"
"Yes, I see they did, and I expected
they would ; in fact, I think the majority
of the people of California will do almost
anything to force the Pacific railroads
into the hands of the Government, think
ing that the Government will be induced
to operate them for the benefit of Cali
fornia, as many claim that she has never
received what she is entitled to from the
Federal Government, and that it would be
nothing more than fair to have the Gov
ernment own and run the Pacific railroads
largely in tbe interest of their State, bo
believing, I have no doubt they would do
almost anything to bring about such a re
sult."
The Star, commenting on this interview,
says: Mr. Huntington's idea of opposi
tion of the funding scheme is undergoing a
steady and gratifying expansion. At first
be represented to Congress that opinion
was confined to a few dozen irresponsible
soreheads, and that California, with the
rest of the world, was at his back.
He now admits that California is not at
his back, but contends that it is a case of
California alone against C. P. Huntington,
Representative Powers, the railroad lobby,
the American Republic and the world at
large.
When the test comes it is expected that
Mr. Huntington may be compelled to ad
mit that opposition to the funding scheme
has extended even outside of California.
The indebtedness of over $100,000,000 due
from Mr. Huntington and his associates
is not owed to California, but to the
United States, and the people in general
may take some little interest in the
prooosition that this debt shall be can
celed by obliterating the principal in con
sideration of a payment of less than tbe
legal rate of interest for a fixed term of
years. ______________
APPROVED BY CLEVELAND.
Expense* of the Commission to Meet in
This City.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May B.â The
President to-day approved the bill appro
priating $75,000 to defray the expenses of
the United States in the proposed joint
commission which, according to the pro
visions of the treaty recently agreed to by
the Senate, is to meet at San Francisco to
assess the damages alleged to have oeen
sustained by Canadian sealers through
being seized or otherwise molested while
engaged in the destruction of seais in
Bering Sea, outside the territorial iimits
of one marine league from the shores of
Pribyloff Islands.
The modifications made by the Senate
in the convention as originally agreed to
by Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Em
bassador, and Secretary Olney, require
that the agreement shall be again referred
to the British Government for approval
but as tbe changes made by the Senate
were finally deprived of all important feat
ures, under pressure brought to bear by
the State Department, it is not anticipated
that any serious difficulty win interpose
to the final ratification and promulgation
of the treaty. As soon as this is accom
plished the three commissioners will be
appointedâ one by the United States, one
by Great Britain and one by the President
of the Swiss Republic.

Happy Following.
ONE COAST RECORD BROKEN.
Festivities to Close With the Parade
of Jolly King Cole and a
Grand Ball.
SAN JOSE, Calm, May B.â There has
been no lull in carnival festivities and the
crowds of visitors who were present at the
opening are staying to see the great floral
fete through.
Interesting were the athletic games wit
nessed by Queen Lillian and her fair and
gallant escort at Recreation Park. Base
ball, basket-ball and varied field sports in
which the cracks of Palo Alto and Berke
ley were arrayed caused unusual interest
to center in the day's events.
To-night a diversified entertainment
given by students of the Stanford Univer
sity at the pavilion was followed by danc
ing, in which the hosts and their guests
joyously participated.
Varied and most entertaining is the pro
gramme for to-morrow. In the afternoon
will be held the League of American Wheel
men meet at Recreation Park, under the
auspices of the Garden City Cyclers.
Old King Cole and his cohorts will
make a wild demonstration in this city to
morrow evening as a grand finale of the
carnival. The King is determined
to wrest the scepter from Queen
Lillian. It is promised that the
King's triumphal pageant will be as
grand and terrible as the demonstration
of the Queen was gorgeous and beautiful.
Company B of the National Guard to-day
completed arrangements by which they
will be able to perform their duties as
escorts extraordinary and fiery lancers to
the hutre imperial dragon that was im
ported from Marysrille.
Tbe Arabian degree Klau will also aid
tbe King in his invasion and resumption
of his power with some mighty demon
strations. The King's forces have through
some treasonable acts of supposed sup
porters of the Queen come into possession
of her royal chariot.
It will be illuminated with hundreds of
electric lights, and will be used by the
X njr in his terrible march to-nignt. Two
ottier floats that were formerly in the ser
vice of Queen Lillian will be turned into
war chariots for the use of King Cole's
court to-night.
It in -â¢r.^nised tbat San Jose's carnival
will close with the grandest outdoor spec
tacular demonstration ever seen on the
coast.
STANFORD'S GREAT DAY.
Baseball and Other Sports at Agricul-
tural Park.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May B.â This was
Stanford day, and at 10 o'clock the student
body of the great university arrived, about
500 strong, on a special train. They were
met at the depot by Roncovieri's band
and escorted through tne streets of the
city. The students wore the cardinal of
the university, and at frequent intervals
along their line of March gave their col
lege yells.
At Market and Santa Clara streets the
students broKe ranks and made their way
to the pavilion and Agricultural Park,
where a baseball game with Berkele y and
field-day exercises were held.
The baseball game drew an attendance
of about 4000, a large part of whom were
ladies. The Stanford team wore cardinal
suits, while the Berkeley boys were dressed
in blue and gold. The playing was excit
ing and the game was one of the best ever

seen in this city. Tht game resulted in
favor of Stanford by a store of Bto 3. The
batteries were McLaine md Jeffs for Stan
ford and Morden and V heeler for Berke
ley.
Neither side scored untilthe third inning,
when Stanford made a tin. In the fifth
Berkeley made two run; and Stanford
scored another, making <he g.ime 2to 2.
The sixth and seventli iftiines were fine
exhibitions of ball-playing the batieriers
doingsplenaid work. In thÂ« eighth Berke
ley knocked out another run, and it looked
like the blue and gold wouldwin.
â¢ vVhen Stanford got to the bat Berkeley
became rattled, and before thiy n aliz?d it
six runs had been made ly Stanford,
Young making a home run. In the ninth
the Berkeley boys failed to score.

The field-day sports in the afternoon
drew about 5000 spectators. Queen Lillian
and her maids of honor were on the scene
early, their gaily decorated vehicies at
tracting considerable attention. They
were interested spectators of the efforts of
Stanford's agile students, and did not
leave the track until late in the afternoon.
During the progress of the athletic sports
and the basket- ball game Runcovieri's
band enlivened the sports with an
occasional selection.
The first event was a 100-yard dash, in
which the contestants were J. P. Bernhard,
Evans Holbrook, George Toombs, J. P.
Colliver and H. Reynolds. The race was
an easy one for Bernhard, who led all tue
way. Harry Reynolds, who has made
quite a reputation as a hurdler, showed
up well in this contest, crossing the line
less than a yard behind the leader. George
Toombs was third, Holbrook fourth and
Coliiver fifth. Bern bard went the distance
in the fast time of 10 1-5 seconds.
The entries for the high jump were:
George Toombs, H. B. Reynolds, C. S.
Dole and R. L. Wilber. This contest was
won by Toombs, who cleared 5 feet 5%
inches.
The exhibition of pole-vaulting by C. S.
Dole aroused quite a little enthusiasm.
Dole's record, which is also the record of
the Pacific Coast, is 10 feet 10 inches, and
he made an attempt to-day to make a still
higher flight. He vaulted over the stick
at an altitude of 10 feet with ease, but 11
feet was just a trifle too much for him.
Once it looked as if he had succeeded, but
just as the Stanford yell began to circulate
the right arm of the vaulter touched the
stick and down it came, the Stanford yell
ending in a whistle as it fell. After a half
dozen creditable attempts Dole concluded
to let bis record stand at 10 feet 10 inches.
In the hammer-throwing contest two
hammers were used, one weighing twelve
pounds and the other sixteen. Dorn of
the University of California threw the
12-pound hammer 180 feet, and C. M.
Ficfcert of Stanford University tnrew the
16-pound hammer 130 feet.
The broad jump was declared off, and in

its place there was a putting the shot con
test.
There was no 16-pound shot handy, so
Fickertand R. L. Wilt>er threw a 12-pound
shot. Wilber won the match, throwing
the shot 54 feet 11 inches, beating the
coast record 9 feet 4 inches.
As a 12-pound shot is seldom used, there
has been little competition for a record
with that weight.
The 220-yard dash was an interesting
contest in which fast time was male. J.
Brunton won in 22 4-5 Beconds, H. B. Rey
nolds was second, George Toombs third
and J. H. Colliver fourth.
Seven sophomores and seven freshmen
then gave an exhibition of fancy tumbling
that caught the crowd.

the acrobats lined up in the following
order for a game of basket ball :
Sophomore teamâ Bradley, front; Hars
ted, front; Hansbery, front; Vandeveer,
center; Carle, guard; Howells, guard-
Rasch (captain), guard. Freshman team-
King, front; Farmer, front; Radon, front;
Bnow (captain), center; Fischer, uuard;
Spencer, guard; Garner, guard. George
P. Baldwin was umpire and Charles D.
Dillon referee.
The game was close and exciting. The
first half of the game was played without
either side scoring a goal, but in the last
half the contestants called on their re- I
serve energy and went after the ball with
renewed vigor. In their enthusiasm both
sides committed a few fouls, but no hard
feeling was engendered. The sophomores
made the first goal, but in a few seconds
the agile freshmen evened up the score.
Six more goals were made during the re
mainder of the pame, four of which went
to the sophomores and two to the fresh
men. At the call of time the score stood
5 to 3 in favor of the sophomores.
The field events were given under the
auspices of the following committee: C. F.
Aaron (chairman), G. B. Wilson J. O
Watson, W. H. Osgood, D. E. Brown, H. 8.
Hicki, W. A. Sutherland, F. V. Keesling
and C. M. Bradley. George Toombs was
track captain, D. E. Brown chairman of
the committee on athletics, J. M. Gregory
starter, and F. E. Keesling and W. H. Os
good timers.
FORESTERS AT WATS ONFILLE.
The Grand Court Conclude* lit Station
by InitattiÂ»o Officer*.
WATSONVILLE, Cal., May B.â When
the Grand Court of Foresters convened
this morning there was a marked decrease
in the attendance, due no doubt to the
activity displayed at the banquet last even
ing. The entire morning session was taken
up with the report of the law committee.
Several amendments relating to the dis
position of appeals and others, which were
submitted with a view of making certain
ambiguous clauses in the Dresent laws
more clear and explicit, were adopted.
Upon recommendation of the committee
on acts and decisions the report of the
executive committee was approved, with
the exception of that part relating to in
surance. When the last Supreme Court
virtually abolished the endowment fund,
several members of the order formed the
Foresters' Mutual Life Association in Los
Angeles, proposing to issue cheap insur
ance to members of the order only. The
executive council recommended that the
plans and purposes of that association be
approved and that it receive the cordial
encouragement and support of tne execu
tive council.
As it has been shown by the member
ship in California at previous sessions of
tbe Grand Court that the insurance fea
ture was not desired, the members of the
visiting board are to be allowed $5 per
diem and actual railroad fare while travel
ing on official visits. It was decided tbat
any member who resides outsiae of the
jurisdiction of his own county must take
out a medical roll curd, and when makin â 
application to be placed on the medical
roll of a court he must pass a satisfactory
examination before ihe physician of the
court to which he makes such application.
This will not apply to those members who,
already having cards, are desirous of hav
ing them renewed upon their expiration.
When the consideration ot the erand
secretary's report of the estimated ex
penses for the fiscal year came up the
economists of the order got down to busi
ness.
The budget called for an outlay of $9590.
This was cut down about. $330 by reduc
inp the allowance to the visiting board
and cutting off the customary subsidy of
$120 to the Forester of America, a fraternal
monthly paper. There has been a great
deal of talk in the subordinate courts for
thejpast year and a great many delegates
had been instructed to make every effort
to have the per capita tax reduced." It was
clearly shown, however, that such a course
would seriously cripple the extension of
the work of the order and that the final
result would be retrogression and the per
capita tax for the coming year was fixed
at 80 cents.
Tne incoming executive council was in
structed to procure the new regalia for
past grand chief rangers and present tbe
same to all such past officers in good
standing. The thanks of the grand body
were unanimously voted to the press of
WatsonviKe and the San Francisco Call
for the clear and succinct reports of the
proceedings of this session, and three
cheers were given for the ladies and citi
zens of Watsonville for tbe hospitality
extended to the visitors. The installation
of officers was performed t>y Deputy Su
preme Chief Ranger C. P. RenJon, after
which the Grand Court adjourned sine die.
WOODLAND WOMEN WORKERS.

Interesting I'rocredinyt.
WOODLAND, Cal., May B.â The Chris
tian Woman's Board of Missions for the dis
trict comprising Woodland and Sacramento
was in session at the Christian Church
this afternoon. The visiting delegates are
Mesdames Adams, Jones, Wallace, Fors
man, Hignet, Wagner, McLean, Lusk,
Collier and Denton and Misses Marie Gar
ret and Phoebe Craig.
The meeting was called to order by Mrs.
A. Li. Boggs, the president, who also con
ducted the devotional exercises and deliv
ered an address of welcome. The response
was made by Mrs. J. E. Denton of Sacra
mento. The audience was then favored
with a solo by Mrs. Arthur McLean. Mrs.
R. D. Adams deMvered the district man
ager's address, in which she reviewed the
work of tbe board during the year.
Mrs. T. S. Spaulding read a paper on
ths subject, "This Is the One Thing I Do,"
which was full of thought and feeling.
This was followed by a solo by Mrs. W. H.
Grant. A paper on the topic, "How Can
We Interest Our Women in Missionary
Work?" was read by Mrs. Collier of Sac
ramento. This was followed by a general

Why Our Women Are Not Interested,"
was read by Mrs. H. J. Schuler. Tnis was
followed by a discussion, participated in
by the members generally. The next in
order was a duet by Mesdaraes Jones and
Forsman. Mrs. C.W. Thomas read a paper

STATE HORTICULTURISTS
Meet at the Capitol and JMgcum the
Fruit Outlook.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 8. â The
State Horticultural Society met in the
State Capitol this morning, and tbe day
was consumed in discussion on various
matters pertaining to the fruit interests of
the State at large. From all reports it
would seem that the damage by frost has
not been uuiversal throughout the State,
serious damage being confined to scat
tered localities, and the outlook for fruit
growers is far brighter than was at first
expected after the iate frosts. At the
afternoon session the members listened to
a lecture on the Irrigation of deciduous
fruits by Professor E. W. Hiigard of the
California University, and a general dis
cussion of irrigation problems followed.

HEALDSBURG, Cal., May B.â A cooler
wind ushered in to-day and a slight fog
was perceptible to early risers. There
were some of these â particularly those
who had "made a night of it" â and the
streets were soon filled with people, many
of whom were willing to rest from carni
vals for another year. The band began to
play, and the throngs to pass and repass,
in happy confusion. Some few took the
early trains for home, but most of the
visitors remained to see the entire round
of events. Tue merry-go-round, the lemon*
ade and icecream stands took in their
share of stray nickels, and even the phono
graph man, with his squeaky, rubber
tubed machine, delighted the small boys
and country maidens and reaped quite a
harvest.
The first event of the day was a balloon
ascension, the balloon being a hot-air bag,
sixty-five feet in heighu The aeronaut
went up with his head in a sling, suspend
ed by the neck, gave some acrobatic per
formances in the air, and descended by
means of a parachute from a height of
nearly 1000 feet.
Following this was an exhibition of
fancy and difficult riding, picking up ob
jects from tbe ground on a running horse,
etc, by "Buck" Coleman of Oregon. This
was quite well done, but when he pro
posed to ride a wild horse on tbe public
street the city dads objected and relegated
the show to a field at tne edj;e of town.
The crowd having adjourned the fiery and
untanv d mustang was brought forth. It
turned out to be a neat three-year-old who
objected somewhat to the rough manner
in which he was being v ed, but showed no
symptoms of vicioustiess. Vigorous spur
ing and "lambasting" elicited a succes
sion of gentle jumps, and while the throng
yelled the caballero dismounted in tri
umph. An old black steed that bad not
quite forgotten his young tricks offered a
more realistic idea of bucking stock and
nave the bold vaquero a sight of a bucking
horse.
The Veteran Firemen and Exempts took
their departure at 2 o'clock, leaving many
newly made friends and bearing kind feel
ings for their hosts of Healrlsburg.
They marched down to the depot with
flying banners, escorted by bands of
ratific, and by those who were sorry to see
them go they will always be welcomed on
tht'ir future returns to Hcaldsburg.
Without any intermission the people
wended their way to tbe wheelmen's meet,
at the east side of town. The bicycle races
at the track were fairly well attended, the
afternoon being very pleasant, though a
trifle windy. The judges were Cowan,
Morse, Shrader and Elliot, with Barnes as
teferee. While waiting for the crowds to
nil up tbe grand stand Messrs. Near and
Smith gave an exhibition mile on a tan
dem, making the run in 2:35 3-5.
The Cloyerdale band having arrived the

The wind blew quite strongly toward
the end of the races, raising some dust.
Two accidents occurred in the final race.
Tantau ran off the track and fell, bruising
himself slightly. Altogether the meet was
considered quite satisfactory and every
body was well pleased.
Later in the afternoon the Calithumpi
ans again made their appearance and the
King bid farewell to the kingdom which
he was not powerful enough to control,
giving way to the Queen, who will to
morrow abdicate in favor of Uncle Sam,
leaving the sweetest memories of her short
but glorious reign. The Prime Minister
has already laid down his insignia of office
and retired to private life, while the Cabi
net is on the point of resigning. The
beautiful valley of Sotoyome will resume
its usual placid appearance on Saturday
morning, leaving the floral carnival of
1896 as a memory of which all may well be
proud and to which our visitors will refer
as to happy days.
AUBURN'S FETE IS ON.
A Pretty Exhibitâ The Optra- House a
Bower of Beauty.
AUBURN, Cal., May B.â The Auburn
festival of flowers is on and a very pretty
exhibit it is. The opera-house is a perfect
bower of beauty. A veritable hanging
tropical garden covers the entire gallery,
and palms, coleus, azaleas, lilies and
spruce and cedar trees are arranged
in artistic confusion. From the ceil
ing and wails over the parquet huge
garlands of evergreen are drooped, and
the walls are matted with tissue-paper
roses set on a charming ivy background,
while hundreds of bright-winged Dutter
flies are apparently flitting from flower to
flower. On either side of the hall the
booths are arranged, thus leaving the
center for promenading. The tableaux
entertainment on the stage has never been
equaled in this city. The show will be
continued to Saturday night at the request
of everybody.

LOS ANGELES'
FRIDAY CLUB,
A Flourishing Organization
of Prominent and
Brainy Women.
PHILANTHROPIC WORK.
Artists, Authors, Newspaper
and Magazine Writers in
the Ranks.
PRACTICALLY A LECTURE CLUB
Mr. J. C. Harvey Entertains the Ladies
With a Sketch of His Ideal
Tropical Garden.
LOS ANGELES, Cat., May B.â The Fri
day Club, an oiganization of ladies, with
the largest membership of any similar as
sociation on the Pacific Coast, held a regu
lar meeting at its hall on South Broad
way this forenoon. This organization con
tains many of the most prominent and
intellectual women of Southern California.
Many of them are noted for works of char
ity in the community. Among the mem
bers may be found artists, authors, news
paper apd magazine writers. A large pro
portion are suffragists.
To a Call correspondent, who was pres
ent on this occasion, many of the ladies
expressed the heartiest approval of the
paper's "new departure." This associa
tion of splendid women is practically a
lecture clnb. Several gentlemen and ladies
of National reputation have lectured be
fore the body on a wide range of topics.
These addresses or essays are followed by
promiscuous discussion and plying of
questions to the speaker. There are few
if any "dummies" in the organization,
and while many of these ladies are house
wives they believe in mixing braibs with
their everyday duties.
The officers are: President emeritus,
Mrs. C. M. Severance : president, Mrs. 3. A.
Osgood; vice presidents, Mrs. W. A. Spald
ing, Mrs. B.C. Whiting; secretary, Mrs.
G. H. Wadleigh; treasurer, Mrs. G. M.
North.
The subject this morning was "A Trop
ical Garden in Southern California and a
Few Notes on Orchids," by J. C. Harvey.
Mr. Harvey is president of the Los An
geles Botanical Society and is especially
interested in the experimental garden this
society has established in Elysian Park in
this city. Mr. Harvey has given the col
lection of orchids presented him by John
D. Rockefeller to East Side Park, his de
sire to benefit and beautify the city being
as great as his love for flowers.
The speaker commenced his paper with
a little sketch on the threshold of the
equatorial region and touched with graphic
lights the magnificent beauty of its vege
tation, the color of the beautiful forests,
the massive dome-like structure of the
trees, the independent growth of para
sites, ferns and numberless aerial plants,
and the prodigious influence of warmth
and moisture were all shown in high re
lief. Gorgeous bird- winged butterflies,
such as toe ornithopetera and bapilos, reach
their maximum size and beauty here.
Of orchids, Mr. Harvey exhibited num
berless plates of these curious and beautiful
plants found in Asia, Africa, Peru, Brazil,
Mexico, the West Indies, Madagascar and
the adjacent islands. The speaker touched
on the extreme beauty of the orchids, the
aerial and terrestrial, the former found in
hot regions on the banks of streams, and
constantly bathed by spray, and the latter
in temperate regions. He further delinea
ted the capricious nature of the orchid, its
enrious structure and habits. This splen
did race of plants owes much of its beauty
to the fact that nature abhors self-fertiliza
tion, and in this class of plants at least,
has provided marvelous contrivances by
which the pollen is protected from the
vicissitudes attending other flowers, and
ultimately disseminated by the aid of
certain insects.
Mr- Harvey then turned to the tropical
garden, and outlined the beauty that could
be produced by the laying out of the same.
The ideal garden should not be less than
200 feet front and 200 feet deep. The resi
dence should be built on one side with a
wide sweep of sward fn front.
The essay and aftertalk were very de
lightful and greatly enjoyed by the club,
the ideal garden portrayed by Mr. Harvey
being greatly appreciated by the many
lovers of flowers.
BRUTALITY PUNISHED.
A Los Angeles Teamster Ha* to Take
\y;-:-'. . Hi* Own Medicine. â¢
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May B.â "The
man not afraid to wantonly beat his
horses" got his deserts here this morning
on South Broadway. G. A. Phelps is the
getlem&n in question. In a most vicious
and inexcusable manner he was found by
J. E. Kelly belaboring his team with a
horsewhip. The good Samaritan protested
against the cruelty, but all in vain. The
human brute said he owned the horses
and would do as tarnation pleased. Kelly
again urged cessation of "horsetilities" to
no purpose; then all of a sudden he
snatched the whip from Phelps' hand and
with great zeal applied it over his head
and shoulders, and finally compelled him
to get into tbe wagon and accompany
Kelly to the police station, where Phelps
was turned over to Humane Officer Clark.
Phelps admitted that he had done wrong,
and further stated that he was ashamed of
himself. Mr. Clark was so impressed with
Phelps' sincerity that he allowed him to
go, and soon after Kelly and Phelps drove
off together.
PASADENA'N BOGUS RARON.
He Play* Havoc With the Fair Bex and
. Hotel- Keepers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May B.âPasa
dena has had an experience with a bogus
Baron, who filled several roles with about
equal grace and dignity. ; He was first the
son of a great' Prussian general."; His cheek
and pretensions gave . him passport into
the "bes t circles, and he made court to
- one .of Pasadena's handsomest young
adies, who, until ' his real . character was
suspected, gave the claimant to "high
}â  title" every encouragement, for this par
" ticular "Baron" not only sported i a legiti
mate- title, but wasâ in his mind,' at j least
âa man of prodigious wealth. :â  -';
But he was a bibulous "Baron," and had
the questionable habit of forgetting to pay.
his small bills, including : one for board
and lodging, to"his accommodating land
. lords. This was considered truly baronial,
but other things, did Pasadena's -Baron
which excited' grave doubt in the minds of
some of the peopla with whom he associ
ated regarding his title, and they wrote to
certain San Francisco people whose names
had l>een used by him, and the reply
was made that his name and title were
both unknown.
Then toe Baron changed the fiction he
related and told his intimates that he was
tbe chief of a great private detective
bureau maintained by the A. P. A. in San
Francisco and New York, his chieftain
ship being of the coast branch. He also
claimed to be a detective gathering evi
dence in the Ashley vs. Baldwin seduction
case at San Francisco, which is now in the
court and in which the Pasadena woman
is the plaintiff. He was not "working at
it," however, his principal occupations
being apparently to run up a big hotel bill
and pay frantic court to the young lady
who would not now accept his'suit.
Detective Goodwin put in an appearance
last Wendnesday evening at the hotel
where the Baron lodged and spent the
night there. This morning the Baron
came to this city and departed just in time
to avoid an explosion of parental wrath,
if not an expose of a past more or less
checkered career. The detectives refuse to
divulge his true name on account of his
highly honorable family in San Francisco.
GROUND BE NEATH A CAR.
Frightful Death of a Mexican Who Was
Hent on Murder.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May B.â As a
northbound Pasadena electric-car was pro
ceeding rapidly along Buena Vista street
this evening two Mexicans, one pursued by
the other and each with a knife in his
hand, attempted to cross tbe street in
front of the car. The first one, Jose
Morales, succeeded, but the other, Salas
Garcia, was struck by the car, dragged 100
feet and literally ground to pieces. Tbe
car was derailed and traffic blocked for an
hour while tbe fragments of Garcia's body
were being got from underneath the trucks.
Morales, who started the fight by striking
Garcia and then retreating, has been ar
rested. Both men are from Cucomonga.
Garcia was forty years old and had a
family.
W. C. T. U. Election of Officers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May B.â The State
Convention of the W. C. T. U. of Southern
California, in session at Pomona, elected
the following officers for the ensning year:
Mrs. N. P. J. Button of Riverside was
chosen president; Mrs. Mary E. Garbutt
of Los Angeles, vice-president; Miss Ga
brilla T. Stickney of Lcs Angeles, corre
sponding secretary; Mrs. L. H. Mills of
Santa Ana, recording secretary, and Mrs.
S. W. Plimpton of Santa Barbara, treas
urer. Miss Stickney said it was not her
will to be corresponding secretary for an
other year, and that she had prayed long
and earnestly over her acceptance of the
office, and with tears in her t-yes and with
broken voice she asked the convention to
pray for her and her work in the next
year. Mrs. Brown offered prayer, and
when the State song was sung the conven
tion adjourned.

TRAGEDIES IN SAN JOSE,
Freeman Butts, Mistaken for a
Burglar, Receives a Death
Wound.
A Mexican Sends a Bullet Through
His Breast After Failing to Ki'l
His Mistress.
SAN JOSE, Cal., May B.â Freeman
Butts, a young man about 20 years of age,
was shot and perhaps fatally wounded by
Joseph Guinasso, in the Willows, about 12
o'clock last night. Some two weeks ago a
small house on the place was burglarized,
and since then Paul Guinasso, a son, has
been sleeping in the place, and, unknown
to Mr. Guinasso, young Butts has been oc
cupying the place with his son. About
midnight Guinasso was aroused by tbe
barking of his dogs and went into the
yard with a pistol-in his hand. He saw a
light in the house, and on looking through
the window saw a man who was not his
son in the place. He pusned open the
door and fired, and as the man fell he
recognized him as young Butts. Young
Guinasso had not yet got home, and Butts
was preparing to retire. The bullet pene
trated the right lung and lodged under the
shoulder. The chances of Butta' recovery
are slim. Guina*3o surrendered himself
at the jail, but was allowed to go.
SUICIDE OF A MEXICAN,
After Attempting to Kill His Mistress,
With Whom He Had Quarreled-
SAN JOSE, Cal., May 8.-Rey Arcia, a
Mexican about 40 years, committed sui
cide at Santa Clara last evening by shoot
ing himself in the right breast. For
several years he has been living with Mrs.
M. S. Rodriguez. Yesterday afternoon
they came to this city, and on their return
home had a row. He fired a shot at Mrs.
Rodriguez and missed her. She ran from
the house, and he followed her into the
yard. He snapped the trigger several
time 3, and placing the revolver against bis
breast, said: "Now I am going to die;
goodby." He pulled the trigger and fell,
expiring almost instantly. It is supposed
Arcia thought the weapon was unloaded,
and waÂ«. trying to scare Mrs. Rodriguez.
An inquest was held this morning, but
not tiing was developed leading to the cause
of the suicide.
TO FORECLOSE A MORTGAGE
Suit Involving a Portion of the San
Antonio Ranch.
BAN JOSE, Cat.., May B.â The German
Savings and Loan Society of San Fran
cisco to-day began suit in the Superior
Court against Anais Hale, administrator
of the estate of Joseph P. Hale, and other
heirs of the latter's estate, to foreclose a
$75,000 mortgage on 1850 acres of land
alons the San Antonio Creek, in this

tonio rancho. The mortgage was given
to secure a note executed by the deceased
on May 12, 1891, for $75,000, bearing inter
est at 7>Â£ per cent per annum. Hale, who
was a han Francisco capitalist, died in

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
HANFORD'S GREAT
REVIVAL SEASON,
Remarkable Religious En
thusiasm Evoked by an
Evangelist.
MANY NEW CONVERTS.
Nearly One Hundred and Fifty
Immersed by the Rev. S.
M. Martin.
KINGS COUNTY INTERESTED.
Revival Services at the Christian
Church Reopened Last Nightâ A
Persuasive Preacher.
HANFORD, Cal., May B.â For seven
weefcs Hanford has been in the throes of
quite a remarkable religious revival, and
last night Revivalist S. M. Martin, at an ex
pense of $20 a lecture, began another sea
son of his meetings at the Christian church
in this city.
The Rev. Mr. Martin is advertised as
"One of the most successful evangelists in
America," and if his work in Hanford can
be taken as an indication of his persuasive
powers his t>ress agent has not availed
himself of even the usual license accorded
that profession. Heretofore Hanford has
never been famous for its religious zeal,
though the city has maintained its fair
quota of churches and preachers. But now
Hanford is stirred, and an extraordinary
interest, even among the non-church goers,
is manifested in these revival services at
the Christian church.
In manner and appearance Mr. Martin
is the typical revivalist. His face is clean
shaven and expressiveand his long black
hair adds streneth to it. His speech is
rather deliberate, but always earnest and
forcible and often quite eloquent. He has
made nearly 150 converts in this city
alone and added them all to membership
in the Christian Church. Such effective
work as this has attracted attention to him
from all over the country, and it is quite
likely that during the next few nights of
his labors here the list will be greatly in
creased. A full list of those who have re
cently joined tbe Christian cburch,
throueh the efforts of the Rev. Mr. Martin,
is as follows:

Among this list are the names of many
who have heretofore been known as pro
aounced non-church goers, but now that
:hese and all the others have been im
mersed and become members of the Chris
tian church the people of Hanford are
wondering wbat will happen next.
Rev. Joseph S. Black, pastor of the
Christian church, is quite gratified at the
work done, and believes that Evangelist
Martin will toon increase the new mem
bership list to over 200. The trustees of
the church are Manford Ludlow, B. X.
Thornton, J. C. Rice and A. B. Cromwell.
The meeting to-night was exceptionally
well attended, and there is everything to
indicate that the interest of Hanford
people in the revival movement will not
soon die ont.
THRILLING AND SURLINE.
A Sea Captain Describes a Volcano on
the Bouth American Coast.
BEATTLE, Wash.. May B.â A volcano
near Hiio, on the South American coast, is
reported to be in active eruption by Cap
tain Birkholm of the American schooner
S. F. Redfleld. Upon her return trip from
Honolulu, whither she had taken a cargo
of lumber, the Redfield was headed toward
the South American coast, and she passed
within a few miles of the group of islands
where volcanic eruptions caused such ex
citement in 1889. Captain Birkholm says
he could plainly hear a subterranean
rumbling. The volcanic mountain is coni
cal in form, ana flames and smoke broke
forth from the very top, which is contrary
to former eruptions of this mountain.
"The sight was most thrilling and sub
lime," the captain said, "and the flames re
sembled a great bonfire lighting up the en
tire sky. While no lives were lost, the dis
turbance was a violent one. The last erup
tion of the mountain came from the side,
and in this instance thiough the openings
so formed great streams of lava flowed
down toward the beacn."
SEATTLE DIVORCE CASE.
Numerous Depositions Filed in Favor of
,VrÂ». Dnwton.
SEATTLE, Wash. , May B.â Some twenty
depositions and affidavits favorable to the
defendant, Mrs. Mamie C. Dawson, in the
Dawson divorce case, were procured by
her counsel, ex-Mayor J. T. Ronald, who
has just returned from San Francisco and
other California cities. They tend to show
that the conduct of Mrs. Dawson while
"doing" . the various flower festivals in
Southern California in 1894 was most ex
emplary; that she did not while in Los
Angeles drinjc with young men; as alleged,
but that on the contrary her escort was
Mr. Eckstrom, a prominent merchant of
that city and a strong Prohib'tionist. -
Los Angeles has contributed . another
deposition, wnich was filed in the Superior
Court to-day for plaintiff, : Dr. Dawson,
that of W. F. Barber Jr. of Chatsworth
Park. Affiant, in bis testimony so taken,
practically corroborates that of George
Kinsey and wife.

ANOTHER TISALIA TRAGEDY.
Result of a Feud Between the San Tups
and See Tups.
VISALIA, Cal., May B.â How Yue was
mortally wounded with a pistol shot in
flicted by Chong Choak about 8 o'clock
this evening. As How Yue came out of the
Joss house he was met by several China
men. He claims that Cheonc John, alias
China Joe, passed a pistol to Chong Choak,
ordering him to Bhoot. The assailants
escaped.
How Yue is a nephew of the late Sue
Lung of the firm of Sue Cheong Lung
Company, the largest Chinese store here.
Last night the firm's store was set on tire,
but it was extinguished by the occupants.
How Yue belongs to the San Yups and
last year was arrested on a warrant sworn
out by a supposed member of the See Yups
charging him with murderine a China
man in Sacramento in 1891. At the pre
liminary examination there he was dis
charged. How Yue had a warrant issued
for the arrest of the prosecuting witness,
but the officers could not find him, and it
is thought that this was the motive for to
night's crime.
THE WEATERVILLE MURDER.
So New Developments in the Retrial of
Van Horn and Crow.
WEAVEKVILLE, Cal., May B.â The
second day of the retrial of Bayles Van
Horn and John Crow has been devoid of
ncident and to some extent reminds one
of the rehearsal of a play, simply covering
ground already gone over. The prosecu
tion are running their witnesses through
with great rapidity and have curtailed the
testimony of the witnesses introduced by
them at the former trial. For a time they
deviated from the beaten track, and it
looked as if something sensational was
going to happen when William Espey was
called to the stand and questioned re
garding his conversation with Joseph
Greeory, it evidently being the purpose of
the prosecution to endeavor to show a con
spiracy the result of which was Jack Li t
tleneld's death.
RETURNS FROM JUNEAU,
A Portland Man Says That
Everything Is Booming
Up There.
Didn't See a Beggar or Idle Man,
and Miners Are Making
$io a Day.
PORTLAND, Ob., May B.â C. S. Mc-
Duffee has just returned from a business
trip to Juneau, Alaska. He says things
up there are livelier than in the days of
'4t>. "It is all nonsense for people to say
that men are coming away from Alaska
because they can't find employment,"
said Mr. McDuffee. "I didn't see a beg
gar nor an idle man in all the time I was
there. Every boat brings great throngs of
men, who start for Circle City the next
day and spread about through the gold
fields. A laborer can get $10 a day for his
work when he gets up there, and there is
plenty of work for all who go. Juneau is
the liveliest city I ever saw. There are
about 2000 people and thirty-eight saloons.
Tne peopleâ men, women and children â
sleep most of the day and sit up celebrat
ing almost ull night. All nationalities are
represented, and gambling-houses, dance
halls, etc., run in full blast. Every hotel
is packed as full as it will hold, and every
steamer that comes in is loaded to the
guards.
To get to the mines from Juneau takes
about six weeks. The inlet must be first
crossed to Dyea, about 100 miles. From
there there is a walk of forty miles across
the mountains to the headwaters of the
Yukon, dragging provisions and outfit on
sledges, either by band or with dogs.
Each party takes about six months or a
year's provisions, a sheetiron stove and a
whipsaw.
"When the Yukon is reached the whip
saw is brought into requisition. Trees are
felled and ripped up into rough lumber
and a boat is built. After that the trip is
an easy one, for all the party has to do is
to get into the boat and float down the
Yukon to the gold fields.
"The Northwest Trading Company has
a steamer up there, with which it expects
to take people around the Aleutian penin
sula and thus into the mouth of the
Yukon; but the steamer, the S. S. Weir,
is frozen in the ice near the mouth of the
river, and it is a question whether they
will ever get her out. Tho people are
pouring into Juneau from all directions,
nut there seems to be no danger of over
crowding. The only mistake people make
is to go up without an outiit, and unless
they have one they cannot possibly get
across the mountains to the Yukon."
JACK, THE STRAGGLER.
Waives Preliminary Examination and Is
Commuted to Jail.
PORTLAND, Ob., May B.â John R. Cos
grove, the thug, who attempted to strangle
to death Marie Levillie, a French courte
san, on tbe night of April 28, declined a
preliminary examination in the Municipal
Court and has been committed to the
County Jail pending the action of tne
Grand Jury. The detectives say that Cos
grove has the most forbidding eyes they
ever gazed into. Tbe longer one looks
into them the more proof they furnish of
the p ossePEor's nature.
Detective Welsh remarked that were
Cosgrove half as cood a man physically as
himself he would no take chances of going
anywhere with him in a friendly way
even, as he believes the fellow to have as
much a mania for murder as had the mon
ster Holmes, who yesterday was hanged
in Philadelphia.
"This fellow," said Mr. Welsh, "comes
nearer being the San Francisco strangler
than any man yet arrested down there for
the tenderloin district murders. His
photographs will be finished to-day, and
early next weak we shall hear whether or
not he has been identified by the tian
Francisco detectives.
"Beyond his confession to having at
tempted to strangle the French woman,
merely to observe her dyinz struggles, and
to see how she would appear after death,
Cosgrove will not talk much. Buthe seems
to gloat over his morbid fancy, and he is
not a bit insane either. He did pay,
though, on being hard pushed that during
tho past few months he has been in San
Francisco and on the sound."
This forenoon Chief Minto received a
telephone message from Dr. Wall at Van
couver, Wash., informing him that a little
over a month ago he caused Cosgrove's
confinement in the Steijacoom asylum to
t prevent bim from committing just such a
crime for which he is now under arrest.
He remained in tbe asylum less than four
weeks and must have come here at once
to commit murder. Cosgrove was not
very well known in Vancouver, but Dr.
Wall believes him to be a strangling mono
maniac This fact strenethens the im
-1 pression of the police that he is the man
wanted in San Francisco.
MADERA ESCAPES
ELUDE PURSUERS,
Tracked by the Officers to
a Point on the Fresno
River.
THE BUCKBOARD FOUND.
A Breakdown Compels the Out-
Jaws to Resort to Horse
back Riding.
BLOODHOUNDS FOR THE CHASE.
Trained Animals From Missouri Are
Expscted to Run Down the
Fugitives.
MADERA, Cal., May B.â William Lave
rone and Jack Roberts have not been cap
tured yet, and everything seems to indi
cate that they do not intend to be until
they have exhausted all avenues of escape.
The officers succeeded in tracking tbem
north across Fresno River and then east,
where they drove into and up the stream
for some distance, driving out of the river
on the south side and taking tbe old Dust
heimer road which leads to Bates, the
place in which they were first captured.
About thirteen miles from town the offi
cers found the buckboard in which the
outlaws had been making their escape,
â¢.vbere it had been broken down and they
had been compelled to abandon it.
The buckboard had been left in the mid
dle of the road with the harness and the
prisoners had then resorted to riding
horseback. The officers thought the horse
had been undoubtedly run all the way,
and if the chase was kept up they would
at last wear him out and compel tbem to
take to their feet.
Deputy Sheriff Timmins brought up
some bloodhounds yesterday afternoon
from Fresno to join in the hunt, and, if a
trail is found, the dogs will be scented, and
in this manner it is hoped they wiU be
able to locate the outlaws.
The bloodhounds have been imported
from Missouri, and have been in Fresno
something over a year, where they have
been in training. They have shown them
selves to be able to do some clever trailing,
but this will be their first experience in
trailing outlaws, and they will be given a
chance to show what they can do in a
practical manner. Timmins and his party
started out last night, and they expect the
hunt to begin in earnest to-day, when
Sheriff Westfall will be relieved. When
last heard of Westfall was about four hours
behind on tbe trail, and it is not unlikely
that he has overtaken his men by this
time. __ _____^____^_
CHAMPION TARGET SHOT,
Fred Gilbert Wins the Honors
at the Clay-Pigeon Tour
nament.
Captures a Valuable Trophy in Ad
dition to Rich Stakes in
Money.
GUTTENBURG, N. J., May 8. â Fred
Gilbert of Spirit Lake, lowa, won the title
of "champion target shot of America" at j
the initial clay pigeon champion tourna
ment which was concluded here this after
noon. Gilbert broke 266 out of a possible
300 "flying" targets, defeating E. D. Ful
ford of Utica, N. V., and J. A. R. Elliott
of Kansas City, who tied for second place j
with 261 birds each. Roilo Heikes of Day
ton, Ohio, finished fourth with a total of
258 broken.
The final struggle was very close, with
two events to decide the winner. The
score read: Fulford 228, Gilbert 227, Elliott
225 and Heikes 224.
The Kansas City man had the worst
luck in the semi-final event and only
scored 18 out of a possible 25. Gilbert
broke 22, Heikes 21 and Fulford 20. The
score was tnen: Gilbert 249, Fulford 248,
Heikes 245 and Elliott 243.
For the first few pairs in the deciding
event the issue was still in doubt. Elliott
was shooting doubles in great form, but
his low record in the expert rule left him
practically out of the race. Gilbert quickly
drew away from Fulford and Heikes,
killing 17 pairs to their 13, and won the
championship amid great applause.
Captain A. W. Money, one of the pro
moters of the tournament, made a short
speech, and presented Gilbert with the
championship cup. The trophy is a hand
some silver cup valued at $300, and will be
held subject to challenge at due notice.
The winner is a well-known live-bird shot
in the West. He won the Dupont cup at
the big shoot at Baltimore last October.
In addition to the title and trophy Gilbert
won about $500 at the tournament, and
had the best general averageâ 643â on the
four days' shoot. Fulford's average of 636
was second best, and Elliott came next
with 624. Heikes was close on with a gen
eral average of 620.

MONTEREY TO CELEBRATE
Semi-Centennial Jubilee of the
American Occupation of
California.
Military and Naval Demonstration
Such as the Coast Never Saw
Before Is Promised.
MONTEREY, Cal., May B.â The execu
tive committee of the Society for the Semi
centennial Celebration of the American
Occupation of California has issued the
following circular: .
We are preparing to celebrate In Monterey
what is virtually the founding of one of the
great empires of modern times â the Pacific
States of the American Union. England bad
her jubilee when Victoria celebrated the
fiftieth year of her accession to the throne;
Italy hers in the fiftieth year of the pontificate
of Pio Nono.
California, this year of her jubilee, com
memorates a fact of much greater importance
and significance. We are la communication
with our National authorities in regard to the
grandest military and naval pageant thi3
coast has yet witnessed, on sea and shore of
Monterey Bay on the 6llÂ» and 7th of July next.
We also expect such a civic demonstration as
shall be somewhat commensurate with the
greatness of the event celebratedâ the Ameri
can occupation of California.
The anniversary of the first raising of the old
flag of the Union over thU State should assur
edly inspire the most ardent feelings in the
hearts of all Cahfornians. We ask all to unite
with us, responsive to the old motto, ' United
we stand,'' and make this a grand occasion
worthy to be remembered eternally in our an
nals. We want such cordial help and assist
ance as shall make the occasion monumental
as our stamp and seal that we approve and
appreciate the work of our own hands in build
ingr up this glorioua Western addition to the
American Union.
We think that California can afford to spend
a day or two in admiring herself, in jubilee
and jubilation and jollity. To this end we
want to make our celebration as free as possi
ble to all comers. We are not aiming at any
catch-penny carnival or flower nests.
Monterey is the place where the events
transDired; Monterey is therefore the place
chosen for their commemoration. The occa
sion is really National. What Nation might
not justly pride itself on such a magnificent
Western addition? What Nation would not
jubilate over such an event ?
But Monterey is poor. Millionaires are not
so thick as mushrooms here. We ask. then,
Borue of those who have ncquireel wealth in
this State to give freely of their abundance
that their less Tuvored neighbors may have a
jolly time and a lifelong memory of a delight
ful California jubilee.
ContriDutions will be gladly acknowledged,
carefully disbursed and faithfullr accounted
for, and may be sent to tne Bank oi Monterey.
In her corporate capacity Monterey has
nobly seconded the labors of the local com
mittee, the Veterans of the Mexican War, tbe
Sloat Monument Association, the pioneers and

How Different
Men Are To-Day,
In the olden times, so twe
are told, men spent most of
their time fighting for coun-
try or for love of the primi-
tive maid, whose beauty was
of that womanly â¢ sort which
inspired in the heart of her
manly lover such a passion
that he thought it a pleasure
to die for her.
In those days men were
not faint-hearted nor weak-
nerved. ....
They did not know of the
ruinous habits which are re-
sponsible for our weak, de-
bilitated men of to-dayâ
habits which drain from the
body ' all the energy, ambi-
tion and courage of manhood;
Excesses, dissipations,
youthful folly â all tend to
wear - out manhood* .Being
contrary to the laws of na-
ture, they sap the very foun-
dation, the r heart of manly ,
vigor, . and leave only the
shell, the nerveless, empty
frame â empty of the life' and
energy of manhood. v
'I would give all I possess
in this world to be able to
live my life for the ' past ten
years over again," wrote a
correspondent to Dr. Sanden

A GKEAT AUDIENCE ADDRESSED
if
Fourth Lecture at Metropolitan Tern-
pie for the Women's Liberal
Lcgue.
Â»er. Peter C. Yorke appeared before an
mher immense audience at Metropolitan
Temple last night to deliver his fourth
lecture in the course on civil and religious
freedom. The lecture was under the aus
pices of the American Women's Liberal
League.
The subject which had been announced
was "Day-springs From on high."
Before 8 o'clock all the seats on the main
floor had beÂ«n reserved and every seat in
the great gallery was occupied. Men
crowded into every bit of the available
standine-room, and it was necessary at tue
door to stop the sale of tickets and to turn
people away. So great has been the de
- mand for seats at these lectures that al
ready there is talk of having the course re
peated either in this City or Oakland for
the benefit of those who have been unable
to gain admission.
On the platform in Metropolitan Temple
last night United States Hags were draped
â¢t the sides of the organ snn over the
front of the lecturer's stand. The organ
was decorated with flowers, and across the
front of it was suspended in red and gilt
letters the name:
: AMERICAN WOMEN'S LIBERAL LEAGUE:
It was 8 :20 o'clock before the big audience
was finally settled in thÂ« seats and about
the aisles. Then the chairmen the platform
were taken by priests and prominent lay
men. Hearty and long-continued applause
marked the arrival of Father Yorke.
Mrs. Thomas H. Griffin sang a contralto
solo and Miss Fannie Ryan sang the
"Nightingale Song."
Frank McGlynn, a nephew of Rev. Dr.
McGlynn of New York, presided. He
spoke of the American Women's Liberal
League, stating that it was composed of
women of all creeds and that its object
was to fight against an evil which has be
come deeply rooted in tnis City. The
league, as be stated, stands for tbe home.
The speaker expressed belief that in this
country there is no need of making laws
to guarantee freedom of religion, which
freedom he declared to be the very spirit
of the American Nation. He continued:
"Yet we cannot close our eyes to the
fact that there is in this country an organ
ization which is contrary to the American
spirit. There has been brought into this
country a horrible thing, formed in igno
rance and bigotry â a cancerous growth â
which has demanded our efforts in com
batting it.
"But a man always arises to every need.
We have on this coast a champion who is
second to none." Then amid an uproar of
applause he introduced the lecturer.
Father Yorke began in a humorous way
and for several minutes he kept the audi
dience in laughter. He said:
"Ladies and gentlemen: Only that I
am used to this, I would think that I was
before the convention at Sacramento, a
eugar-coated delegate for St. Louis.
"In my lecture to-night I have only two
preludes. One relates to the Women's
Congress, of which I speak with the deep
est reverence.
"At the congress it was stated that at
an ecclesiastical convention in the Middle
Ages it was decided that women had souls,
but that their souls were of a very inferior
class.
"Now that is an old gap. It is like the
Jesuit oath in Dr. Wendte's quotations.
We hare been told that, in convention as
sembled, a lot of old monks, who had some
strange aversion to their mothers, de
clared that women could not enter the
' kingdom of heaven.
"I am sorry that any member of the
Women's Congress sliould be deceived into
repeating such a silly tale. They should
not forget that it was the Catholic church
that lifted woman out of the darkness in
which paganism had placed her.
â¢'The other prelude I don't care to say
much about. But at Sacramento we have
had the spectacle of one of our great po
litical parties in convention with a hide
ous organization, crawling out of its cata
combs, to attempt to gain control. We
have had the spectacle of Benjamin Hud
elson, clad in his yellow jacket and pea
cock feathers, sitting before that conven
tion and attempting to dictate its policy.
"It is not my place now to tell him a
man now a delegate went to that Hudel
son and said that if he was not elected a
delegate he would tell all about the organ
ization. And the man was elected. But
as sure as there is truth in heaven, these
things will be known. It is a disgrace to
tiie Republican party that this could have
been.
"They put in the platform a plank re
garding sectar.an schools, when they
knew that no appropriation has been re
ceived by a sectarian school in this State
for thirty years. They put m a plank
about what could not be accomplished,
and they said nothing about religious
liberty which was n danger.
"I say it is a shame that these men in
tbe convention should not have stood up
for the flae whose fteedom they enjoy."
Father Yorke tooK up the evening's lec
ture at this point and after briefly review
ing the subjects of tbe previous discourses
be said :
"It is usually said, Udies and gentlemen,
particularly when it U to the interest of
preachers to pitch intothe Po'pe, that all
religious freedom camawith the Reforma
tion; that before the Reformation any man
who attempted to f-xpreÂ»san opinion of his
own about religion woild be cast into
prison or have hi? head Cit off.
"It is a familiar old tiage that 'Those
who live in glass house; mustn't throw
stones' ; and if we look through the history
of Protestantism we will tud that it has a
long record of intolerance and persecu
tion."
Quotations from Hallam and others were
repeated, and then the priest continued:
"I say, as I have said before, that I tind
no pleasure in retailing the misdeeds of
the fathers of the Protestants, but I wish
to show that if we are to be judged by
what our ancestors did, there is nothing
more against us than can ,be charged
against the Protestants."
Father Yorke took up the early history
of the Protestant church in England, be
ginning witii the time when '"the light of
the Gospel," as he remarked, "was seen
in Anne Boleyn'g eyes."
"Now, the Scotch," he continued, "have
a way of doing things thoroughly. When
they abolished the Pope they also abol
ished the Bishops, and priests also. Only
one thing was more hated by the Scotch
than the Catholic Pope and clergy. That
on* thing was the English Bishop. When
they first saw the Bishop who was placed
over them they did not like him. And it
Is recorded that one womau arose from
her seat â they had no pews in those days,
and each person carried a stool. This
woman arose and took the stool by one
leg, aimed it at the Bishop and â missed
him."
The narration of this incident was re
ceived with laughter. Serious extracts
from the English historians were next
read to show the Catholics were perse
cuted in Great Britain. "And yet," the
lecturer added, "people with the taint of
these outrages fresh upon their characters
come here to say hon* the institutions of
this country shall ne run."
"What Protestantism Did for Ireland"
waÂ« the subject of another branch of the
lecture.
"One class of Catholics is singled out for
reprobation. We who are thus singled
out even from our fellow Catholics rejoice
in the term of our disapprobation and we
are glad to be called 'the Pope's Irish. 1
"Tne people who have wronged the
Irish, and who hate them because they
have wronged them, and for no other rea
son, are not content with what they have
done at home, but have crossed the sea
with their hate. Aud we believe that the
organization which is now exercising its
hatred against the Irish Catholics is sent
out from England. There is no action
taken against the German Catholics.
Italians are told that the only., object of
the organization is to fight the Irish. Over
in Alameda County the organization gets
very effectively the Portuguese vote, and
it tells the native California Catholics of
the south that it loves them like brothers."
Telling the story of the treaty of Lim
erick and the Parliament violations of it,
the lecturer said: "Remember that the
people who composed that Parliament are
tbe ancestors of the A. P. A.
"The A. P. A. has not yet come to the
point at which they want to prevent the
Catholins from voting. It does not care
how much they vote, so long as they have
only Protestants to vote for."
The persecution of priests was made the
subject of a powerful and vivid picture of
life on the Irish moors, when Â£5 was the
reward for the bead of a prieÃt, and Â£5 was
likewise tbe reward for the head of a wolf.
Following put that line of the discourse,
Father Yorke stated that it was made a
matter of outlawry for any man to send
his son or daughter out of the country to
be educated. Tbe hedge schoolmaster aid
bis work in secret, and in spite of the
power of the British Government he
taught the children to read. Sometimes
the children went to the graveyards to
learn their letters from the headstone;.
Their only path to education was over the
graves of their sires.
"Education was not stamped out by the
Orange A. P. A.
"And yet, in spite of this awful record,
the people whose ancestors were responsi
ble for all this dare to come and taunt the
Irish people for their ignorance."
The lecturer sÂ«id that he would not at
tempt to place responsibility on the de
scendants of those w:o carried on the old
time persecution. To trace back far
enough would show that all our ancestors,
perhaps, were either cannibals or pirates,
but that should not make all people ene
mies. But if the question of ancient intol
erance is to be raissd at all it will be found
that the intolerance or the persecution was
not all on the part of Catholics.
Father Yonce stated that in tbe contest
between Catholics and Protestants, wher
ever the Jews appeared the Jews appeared
to get the worst of it. He compared that to
the case of the person who interfered in the
quarrels of man and wife. He quoted
from a life of Martin Lmher an extract
severe upon the Jews, that the books of the
latter, and even the Old Testament should
be taken away and that rabbis should be
compelled to work for a living. In com
parison to that he read from an editorial
in The Call of April 6, 1894, which edito
rial in reviewing Graetz's "History of the
Jews" said:
Not the least interesting chapter in the story
is the one which relates to the experience of
the Jews at Rome. When all Europe was hunt
ing down the chiluren of Israel they found a
safe retreat under the shadow of the Vatican.

instigated it, but the Popes, without exception,
spread their shields over the proscribed race
and stood its friends when it had no other
friends anywhere.
Persecution in America was touched
upon briefly, among the Puritans and
others, and the lecturer declared that in
the early days of the country religious
freedom for every body could be found only
in Maryland. Cotton Mather in Massa
chusetts declared that tie doctrine of tole
ration was a doctrine of the dcvil â while
in Maryland the, Jesuits declared the prin
ciple of "Live and let live."
Sinbad the Sailor was brought Into the
lecture, with the story of the man who
was carried across the river on the shoul
ders of another, and who then would not
get off. "He had a good place," said the
lecturer, "and he concluded to stick to it.
'Twould take more than four members of
the Board of Health to remove him."
This caused three long waves of laugh
ter to roll over the audience. Father
Yorke used the story to illustrate the
statement that saddled on several of the
denominations are men who cannot be
got rid of. He alluded in a jocular manner
to the "Very Rev. Dr. Dille." the "Most
Rev. Dr. Hirst," "Dr. Goodwin, who has a
score to pay to Rabbi Voorsonger," and to
Dr. Bovard.
Thomas Jefferson was the author of the
Declaration of Independence, Father
Yorke recited, but on bis tomb, at Jeffer
son's own request, is merely the inscrip
tion that "He was the author of religious
freedom in Virginia. 1 ' That honor was
regarded by Jefferson as the highest.
The lecture was concluded with a glow
ing prophecy of religious freedom in the
future.
The Final Lecture.
Next Thursday evening the fifth and
last lecture of the course will be delivered
by Father Yorke. The subject announced
is "The Noontide of Freedom."
TWO BISHOPS PRESENT.
Woman's Auxiliary Board Listens to
Bishops Johnson and Nichols.
The annual session of the Woman's
Auxiliary of the Board of Missions of Cali
fornia was opened at St. Luke's Episcopal
Church yesterday morning by the celebra
tion of the holy communion by Bishop
Nichols.
It was followed by an address by Bishop
Johnson of Los Angeles. The Bishop
marshaled a great array of facts in rela
tion to the United States, especially the
West â its marvelous resources, its varied
population, its riches, its prospects and
the importance of winning the people of
America to Christ.
The afternoon session was opened with |
an address by Bishop Nichols.
This was followed with an animated
speech by Miss Jarvis, secretary of the
Woman's Auxiliary Board of Connecticut.
Speaking of missionary life among tbe
Indians of the Middle West, she said that
it was like a step into paradise to find
one's self in California among the roses
and the evergreens.
"They tell me," she said, "that there is
a rock somewhere on this coast where the
waves of two opposing currents of the sea
meet and are dashed high in tbe air. It
seems to me that tbis repVe.Â»ents the situa
tion of your beautiful State. You gaze
xoward the Orient, and behold the waves
of darkness sweeping over those benighted
lands; tben you turn and gaze in the other
direction where the same condition pre
vails in many place?."
After a description and comparison of
the Woman's Auxiliary Boards of Con
necticut and California, and some friendly
words of advice, she spoke again concern
ing the Golden State.
"It is impossible to describe the sensa
tions of one coming to tbis State for the
first time," she said. "However, there is
just one faint simile I wish to leave with
you. It is in regard to the beauty of your
flowers and the shells along the shore.
They seem to me to be the color of heaven
itself, and surely will be found upon the
throne."
The secretary, Mrs. A. W. Lawyer, pave
her annual report, followed by the reports
of the secretary of tbe Junior Board and
of the Press Club Auxiliary.
A new constitution was adopted, as be
ing better suited to the body in its en
larged state.
St. Luke's Church, and especially the
choir, was tendered a vote of thanks for its
kindness and hospitality, and the board
adjourned.

TWO BROKERS
WHO FAILED,
Edgar L. Atkinson and
Charles P. Harris Were
Pinched.
THEY WERE TOO SHORT.
A Crowd of Irate Women Waited
With Hat Pins and Pav
ing Stones.
WORTHLESS CHECKS GIVEN OUT
An Unexpected Rise of a Dollar or
Two Threw the Shorts Into
Consternation.
A group of a dozen excited women held
an indignation meeting in front of Charles
P. Harris' stockbroking office, 318 Pine
street, yesterday afternoon. These women
were poorly dressed and evidently had
worked long and hard for the money which
they had sunk in the shafts, drifts and
tunnels in the Comstock mines. They
had put up margin after margin for
months, and now that the market had
boomed between $1 and $2 a share and
they had an opportunity of doubling their
money, they found this notice on Mr.
Harris' door:
; "Owing to anticipated money not \
: having been received, th it office is cloned :
'. pending investigations of accounts. '.
'. Address all communications to 11. C. '.
'. Firebaugh, SÂ£s Montgomery.
I "A meeting of those interested will '.
; be ht ld Saturday, May 9, at 1 o'clock, \
: at the office of U. C. Firebaugh."
It was fortunate for Mr. Harris that he
had gone home to be out of hearing not
only of the shouting and wrangling brok
ers in the bullpit, but of the shrill impre
cations of a bloodthirsty mob of women
who had became his clients and had lost
their money.
Young Edgar L. Atkinson also went
home early. There was a crowd of irate
women in front of his door also. They
shooK their fists at the windows. Some
of them tucked up their sleeves and spat
on their hands. One woman was observed
to take a silver dagger out of her back hair
and hide it in her right sleeve. Another
picked up a granite paving block, weigh
ing about ten pounds, and tucked it under
her cape.
They were waiting to ask Mr. Atkinson
to give them back their money. As the
alternative they proposed to tear out his
hair by the roots, stab him with hatpins
and brain him with the raving block.
But he had vanished, and at his ele
gantly furnished home at 1444 McAllister
street his father, T. T. Atkinson, answered
the doorbell and informed all inquirers
that Edgar was not at home.
Young Atkinson had been short on the
leading Comstock stocks for a long time,
and when the boom of $1 a share or so
came he refused to play any more in the
stock market yard and declined all invita
tions "to holler down its rain barrel or
climb its apple tree," because the market
bad not been good to him.
On Thursday when the boom came, Mr.
Atkinson gave his personal checks in ful
fillment of certain obligations, and when
the checks were presented at the bank the
holders were informed that Mr. Atkinson
had no funds on deposit and that, there
fore, the checks were worthless.
T. T. Atkinson said last night that his
son had received certain checks from per
sons doing business with him, and that he
I had deposited those checks to bis credit in
the bank. The checks proved to be worth
less, and the result was that .Edgar's
checks had nothing to stand upon and
were dishonored.
"Those who owed my son money did
not meet their obligations to him," added
Mr. Atkinson senior. "My son was a fool
to allow his checks to be dishonored. If
he had been a man of more experience
and probably less scrupulous he would
have sailed in and trusted to fortune to
tide him over. He had plenty of friends
and backing to enable him to nave done
this. Bnt when he found that his checks
had been dishonored he thought it time to
call a halt."
In reply to a question as to the extent of
his son's shortage Mr. Atkinson said that
it could not have been very much, because
stockbroking nowadays had become a
"peanut business. He declined, how
ever, to state the amount.
"In 1886," he continued, "I paid out be
tween $700,000 and $800,000 in stocks, and
fulfilled all my obligations. Those wt re
days when stockbroking was a business.
I never thought that I was doing any busi
ness at all if I did not clear $100 per day
over all expenses. In some months I
cleared as high as $10,000 and $15,000. But
its peanuts now."
Mr. Harris kept out of the way. He de
clined to state the amount of his losses, or
rather of tbe losses of his patrons. His
attorney, Mr. Firebaugh, was equally reti
cent. Young Atkinson had been doinc
considerable business for Mr. Harris, both
being short on the market.
The failure of the two dealers was not
reported officially to the Stock Board yes
terday. A prominent broker said that if
the defaulting brokers did not redeem
their checks they would be deprived of
their seats in the board.
The sharp rise in quotations of the lead
ing Cotnstock mines is said to have been
caused by the discovery of rich ore bodies
on the Brunswick lode in the Chollar,
Con. Virginia and Occidental especially.
On Thursday Chollar jumped from $1 43
in the morning session to $2 15 in the
afternoon session. Yesterday it started
at $2 20 and dropped in tbe afternoon to
$195.
Occidental jumped from $1 20 to $1 30 on
Thursday and to $2 30 yesterday morning,
closing in the afternoon at ?â _' 15.
Con. Virginia rose on Thursday from
$2 20 to $2 90 and yesterday from $2 85 to
$3 00.
While the advance is not sufficient to
create a furor in tbe market it is bailed as
a revivor of business. There is a large
amount of capital in this City and if a
goodly number of pockets of gold are dis
covered on the Brunswick lode and if the
work of exploration is pushed vigorously
much capital will be invested in stocks
and thereby put into circulation.
FOUGHT HALF AN HOUR.
Two Workmen In the Parrott Building
Come to Fisticuffs.
Patrice Hall, a tile-setter, and Chris
Shnider, a carpenter, both employed in
the Parrott building on Market street, bad
a lively set-to yesterday on the third floor
of the building during the noon hour.
The day previous Hall was setting tiles
and Shnider happened to step on some
wet ones, spoiling them as a consequence
and causing Hall extra work to repair the
damage.
The tile-setter lost his temper and repri
manded Sbnider, who took offense, and in
an instant both were pummeling each
other.
Employes separated them, but each was
bent on revenge, and mutually agreed
to settle the argument next day during
the noon hour.
After partaking of their midday meal
the two contestants and about fifty em
ployes of tne building repaired to a large
room on the Market-street side, and at
12:30 o'clock hoctilities commenced.
was altogether lost sight of, and
both men sailed into each other, ham
mer and tongs, with Hall forcing, the
fighting from tne start. Blows were fly
inÂ« in all directions, but they seldom
made connection. Finally Hall caught
Shnider on the point of the jaw and
knocked him flat on his back. Shnider
announced that he had had enough.
The men fought continuously from 12:30

THE DAWN OF A
NEW DAY
On Sansome street, between
Pine and Bush, marked by a
lot of big blue signs, is the
wholesale clothing manufactur-
ing concern of BROWN BROS.
& CO. They do an immenss
retail business as well as whole-
sale â selling to consumers as
well as dealers â but the feature
of startling interest is that their
WHOLESALE AND
RETAIL PRICES ARE
THE SAME!
They will sell you one suit
(or more) for your own use at
the same prices as if you bought
a hundred to sell again !
Whether this is fair to the
dealer is not the question ; bet-
ter ask yourself what YOU can
save.
For instance : A FINE CAS-
SIMERE SUIT that retails at
$18 you can get here for $10 ! etc.

SATURDAY ....MAY 9, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
It is now time for the Democrats to get
in and piay ball.
After the festival it is a wise head that
knows its own hat.
It is otilv Republican conventions that
are commented on tliis year.
The idea of a greater San Jose was good,
but San Jose at large takes the cake.
Congress might as well get out of the
way and let the conventions have the
earth.
An early adjournment of Congress is not
the best way to kill the funding bill, but it
will do.
It seems very clear now that the fund
ing bill is on a toboggan slide that ends
in a ditch.
What Democracy needs most is a leader
who can drive the bosses away and clean
up the camp.
Now is the time for all loyal Republi
cans to get into ranks and begin to or
ganize for victory.
We have never had to apologize for our
weather, but it has needed a good deal of
explanation this spring.
In turning to-night from Queen Lillian to
King Cole, San Joss will make a fool of
herself and be glad of it.
Up to date not a single Republican has
Bhown a sore head over the party action
in any portion of the country.
The way to a greater and more prosper
ous California is along the road that the
Republican procession moves.
The surest way to provide yourself with
good reading for to-morrow is to leave
orders for The Sunday Call to-day.
Kicks against the Sacramento conven
tion are made only by Democrats, and it
Is a good sign that they are kicking hard.
According to the administration esti
mates the Chicago convention will stand
on the gold platform or spill itself in forty
directions.
About the best thing the Chicago con
vention couJd do would be to take up the
St. Louis ticket and move to make it
unanimous.
The Call has not only supported
woman suffrage it?elf, but it has been the
cause of a good many other papers getting
in and praising the ladies.
This is the time for intelligent business
Democrats to think over the situation and
see if they had not better come out frankly
for protection and prosperity.
The administration would be better
pleased with Senator Hill's frequent de
fenses if he would only get in one occa
sionally that succeeded in defending it.
While the war clouds hang over her
Europe consoles herself in the fact that
the annual spring tour of the cholera
seems to have been postponed for this year.
It would be worth while to hold a festival
in San Francisco, just to get up enthusi
asm enough to brat? on the weather, as
they are doing in San Jose and Healds
burg.
There are few predictions worth risking
in regard to Democratic affair?, but it is
cafe to say when the Chicago convention
meets Cleveland won't go tishing unless
with a telegraph line.
While the Democratic organs have not
even suggested a Presidential candidate
for their own party, they have already be
gun to tell their fool readers the names of
the members of the McKinley Cabinet.
Amid the uproar of politics there can
be heard from Colorado the wailing of a
few faint voices, declaring that the cures
accomplished by Schlatter have been as
transitory as the healer himself, and will
have to be done all over again.
It is estimated that 600,000 youn* Ameri
cans will cast their first Presidential vote
thia year, and fortunately the Republican
party has enough young men's clubs to
take them all into camp and teacn them
how to march with the procession.
The chief objection to the proposed ad
journment of Congress on May 18 is that
it would not give time for the Senate
Finance Committee to report on the. bond
deals at thia session, and the people wish
to hear from it before the campaign begins.
The American Investor and Pacific Re
sources has issued for April an exception
ally strong nnmber, which deserves a
wide circulation in the East, as an adver
tisement of the advantages California offers
to settlers and to all who are seeking good
investments for their caDital.
In a recent interview Pattison followed
the lead of Russell to the extent of declar
ing he is not an avowed candidate for the
Presidency and is not sure his name will
be presented at the Chicago convention
and thus do we have a sign that the Har
rity boom will be sicklied o'er by a pale
cast of thought and lose the name of
action.
START THE WORK.
The general satisfaction among Republi
cans over the work accomplished by Ihe
Sacramento convention has ?:<:-nerated a
spirit of confidence in the ranks of the
party that ought to be made use of at once
in effecting a complete organization for
the campaign. At present there is har
mony everywhere and a sanguine feeling
that amounts to an enthusiasm for Repub
lican success. This will be an effective aid
to local leaders in getting campaign clubs
and leagues recruited for the coming con
test and the opportunity should not be
neglected in any county in the State.
It is true the time is yet distant before
the actual opening of the campaign will
take place. The mass-meetings and the
torchlight processions will not be called
for until late in the summer. It is never
theless none too early to set about the task
of performing the preliminary work and
getting the loyal members of the party
into position where they can render the
mo3t effective service. It would be a good
stroke of politics for the party in Califor
nia to show itself already fairly well or
ganized where the ratification meetings are
held after the Presidential nomination in
June, and if this is to be done the work of
organizing must, of course, be undertaken
without delay.
One of the most important parts of the
organizing wck will be that of enlisting
the young men of the State in the ranks
of the grand old party. It is estimated
that 500,000 young Americans will cast
their first Presidential vote this fall. The
Republican party, by its watchwords,
"Patriotism, protection and prosperity,"
can readily claim for itself the allegiance
of these younc men in every State in the
Union, and particularly can it do so in
California, where patriotism is so ardent,
protection so necessary to industry and
prosperity in all lines of business so essen
tial to that rapid development of our re
sources which will give California its right
ful rank among the great States of the
Republic.
The feeling amons; the people of the
State at this time is most propitious to the
successful performance of the work of
adding new recruits to the party ranks.
Democracy and Populism arc completely
demoralized. They have neither of them
either a platform or a candidate to which
they can invite the support of young
men or of independent voters. The cen
eral public is naturally inclined to listen
to Republican arguments now. When the
heat and excitement of the actual cam
paign has disturbed the minds of men it
will be much more difficult to make con
verts than at present, when the voice of
reason is heard without prejudice or
passion. This, therefore, is the time to
begin the campaign. Start the work at
once.
WHY SO EXTRAORDINARY ?
The delighted surprise exhibited by all
supporters of equal suffrage that The Call
should have come to the support of tlie
cause is an eloquent disclosure of a condi
tion of affairs whicu should never have
been permitted to exist. The Call has
been under its present management only
a year and a half. During that time, as
occasion arose, it has made several radical
departures from the standard of journal
ism to which the people of California had
been accustomed. One of its first radical
innovations was to publish the railroad
time-tables without charge after their pub
lication had ceased by reason of the fact
that the Southern Pacific refused to pay
for the service. The Call restored them
to its columns in order to serve a public
convenience. It was essential that the
people should know when the trains ar
rived and deparled, and when the South
ern Pacific refused to perform that service
The Call came to the rescue.
"Another unheard-of thing was The
Call's refusal to be bribed by the lottery
companies. The advertisements of these
i.windling concerns are paid for at a very
handsome rate and the bait is a sore
temptation to newspapers which do not
scruple to assist rascally enterprises in
roobing the public. Not content with re
fusing thus to be bribed, The Call has
vigorously attacked these swindlers and
has lent its whole force to the overthrow
of the disreputable downtown poolrooms
and all other pernicious forms cf gam
bling.
Its more recent efforts to overthrow cor
rupt boss politics in the local Republican
party are fresh in the minds of the people,
and its success in the State Convention
has been as gratifjing as it was complete.
While these and other departures which
it made were aimed at evils that were
sapping. the purses and self-respect of
the community, it has done many
things of a building-up kind. In place
of corrupt political management it has
supported the leadership of a clean and
vigorous man. a member of a family
that has done and is doing more for Cali
fornia than any other in the history of the
State. It has fought the infamous fund
ing bill because that measure would con
done the rascality of the aided roads and
perpetuate the transportation monopoly
which has so grievously hampered the
progress of California. It has vigorously
supported the Nicaragua canal as a meas
ure which manifestly would lighten the
burdens which our people have to bear. It
has supported the free coinage of silver in
the conviction that the interests of the
West in particular and of the Nation in
general would be greatly advanced by the
rehabilitation of the white metal. Last
and most advanced of all it has come
forth in the advocacy of woman suffrage
as a measure both of justice and wisdom.
These items make a showing of ad
vanced, aggressive and independent jour
nalism entirely new in this part of the
world. In view of the many things which
The Call has attempted and achieved
there should have been no great surprise
at its advocacy of woman suffrage when
the occasion arose for taking ground on
the subject. That occasion was the eve of
a Republican fctate Convention whose in
fluence could be exercised in National
affairs. That the convention accepted the
policy suggested by this paper was a suffi
cient vinoication of The Call's advocacy
and of the right of th^ cause which it sup
ports. In the future there need be no
great surprise at any course which The
Call may pursue in its determination to
reflect and advocate all that is best in the
advancement of human progress.
RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION.
In demanding the enactment of National
legislation that will prevent the landing
of objectionable foreigners upon our shores,
the Republican party of California is sus
tained by every political economist 01 this
country. Foreigners who come here for
the purpose of bettering their condition,
and identify themselves honestly and sin
cerely with our institutions, are always
most welcome. Indeed, 6uch immigrants
are cordially invited to come by the Repub
lican party everywhere. Such acquisitions
to the country's numerical and industrial
strength are desired. Whether they be
farmers, merchants, mechanics or labor
ers, there is always unobstructed oppor
tunity, so far as the good wishes of our
people go, for them to build homes for
| themselves. They are a desirable element
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, 31 AY 9, 1896.
in any community, and hence they are
greeted hospitably.
But it is the illiterate, the criminal, the
social and political agitator, the disturber
of the peace, and those who come, not to
make this country their permanent home,
but to accumulate money for the one pur
pose of returning witi it to their European
or Asiatic homes, whose coming should be
forbidden by our laws. This class does not
hesitate to reduce tha waga schedules of
our wage-earners if thereby they can
secure their jobs. It is anything that will
enable them to return to their own coun
try with the savings of their wage-cutting
methods of procuring employment.
These and the other kinds of objection
able persons mentioned are not only never
in harmony with our system of covern
merit, but for the most part they have con
tempt for it. Some come thinking the
United States offers a wider field for a life
of crime, a life of pauperism, or oppor
tunity to underbid our own wagemen and
wagewomen in the employment market.
It is this class the Republican party of
California demands that shall be refused
permission to land udoq our shores, and
the party has no stancher supporters in
this than such foreigners as come in hon
esty of purpose and in goou faith to make
industrious and true citizens.
"THE SUNDAY CALL"
The splendid work being done by the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art and other
institutions for the education of young
artists is deserving of all consideration,
but this should not make us forget that
San Francisco had already furnished a
number of conspicuous names to the roll
of artistic fame before these agencies came
into existence. The purpose of a highly
interesting article in to-morrow's Call is
to name the distinguished artists that
San Francisco has produced and eive an
outline of their achievements.
A description of a remarkable curiosity
shop in San Francisco and the stranee his
tory of Its creator will bring to the general
notice a unique character with which
most "old-timers" are familiar. The col
lection bears an intimate relation to the
early history of California.
One of the most interesting features will
be the extraordinary history of the fruit
less effort recently made to bring about
the release of a well-known Californian
from an insane asylum where he has been
confined for years. It is one of the most
dramatic and pathetic chapters in the his
tory of the State.

In view of the earnest attention which
has been recently drawn to the subject of
dockyards in this country, a paper by
Lieutenant W. R. Hamilton, U. S. A., on

George D. Baird will contribute another
to the series of articles on "The Young

The contribution on George Francis

much attention that it has been deemed
advisable to follow it with another original
paper entitled "The Holding Up of the
German Mail," and detailing a dramatic
incident in the career of this remarkable
man.

literature and others.
All the features of the Sunday issae arc
designed to carry out the general policy of
The Call to be a newspaper which is none
the less able and comprehensive because
it is clean and wholesome. That ti.e ad
vent of a newspaper aimed distinctively
to edify, delight and instruct the home is
a welcome factor In local journalism is
evidenced by the appreciation which it re
ceives. Its value as an exponent of Cali

derstood by those who make a point of
sending the Sunday issue to their Eastern
friends.
THE PHILOSOPHY OP PROTECTION
The declaration of the Republican Con
vention at tiacramento in favor of such
protection to American industries as shall
remove them from beyond the hurtful in^
fluence of foreign competition voices the
philosophy of true political economy. It
declares for protection in the fullest and
deepest meaning of the word. It does not
make manufacturing enterprises the cen
ter of all efforts, leaving other industries
to participate in the overflow of the good
that come direct to mill ana factory, but
purposes to have all industries receive
their full share of protection direct and on
their own merits.
The Sacramento declaration contem
plates comprehensive reciprocal relations
between all the industries of the country
upon the broad and substantial basis of
mutual interests and oneness of ultimate
benefit. It means that in the whole range
of employment and employments' prod
ucts, from the most obscure day laborer to
the most gigantic industrial plant, there
fball not be left a single individual or in
terest unprotected. This is the solution
of the whole problem of protection, and
the country will show wisdom if it accepts
it and makes it the chief stone of the cor
ner of the Nation.
The science of government teaches self
ishness as between nations. Not that self
ishness which is born of envy and greed,
but of that which holds to the well
grounded doctrine of self-preservation first,
and then the reaching out to help broaden
the avenues of the going and coming of
others. Civilization owes its progress to
the practical application of just such prin
ciples, and in declaring itself in favor of
protection that protects from the lowest to
the hiphest active factor in the Nation's
work the Repnblican party of California
teaches the highest and truest philosophy
of economics and lays down the principles
of government that not only tend to the
greater accumulation of wealth, but to the
advancement of the people along all lines*
that make for the loftiest and worthiest
civilization.
The readiness with which men believe
all the reports of miraculous freaks of
Kansas cyclones, while remaining incred
ulous of what is told them of the effects of
California sunsuine, is another evidence of
the proneness of the human mind to turn
away from the good and accept the worst
that cornea.
As Senator Hill was able to induce only
five Senators to vote with him in opposi
tion to an investigation of the bond deals,
it seems clear the dwindling process will
soon reduce the Democratic party in Con
gress to such a condition it can crawl out
of a keyhole and escape notice.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
L. L. Williams of Sitka, United States Mar
shal of Alaska, Is among the recent arrivals at
the Grand. Mr. Williams ha* been in Aluska
long enough now to be regarded as an old set
tler. He is one of the influential men of that
distant Territory.
Mr. Williams went to Alflska from Boone
ville, Mo., in 1896, having been appointed by
President Cleveland to the position of United
States Commissioner and Judge of Alaska. He
served four years and was appointed a member
of the World's Fair Commission from Alaska.
Some time after this he was appointed United
States Marshul for Alaska and he has held
that position ever since.
He tells many things of interest concerning
the land which, at the time of Seward's pur
chase, was considered little better than a huge
iceberg.
"There is an extraordinary rush to the gold
fields," he said, "butatSitkatheiniereetseems
United States Marshal L. L. Williams of Alaska, Now Here, Formerly United
States Judge and Also World's Fair Commissioner,
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
largely centered la the Cooks Inlet mines. The
day I left a steamer arrived with 300 pe'oplo
and when they got off and scattered about they
almost blocked the streets of the little town.
"The people arriving are of all kinds. Some
are careful and with some money, and others
are adventurers, pare and simple, no doubt.
Some people ask if we have plenty of food at
Sitka. There we have just as much propor
tionately as you have here and as little chance
of running short. It is away out in the inte
rior, as, for Instance up the Yokon, that the
I supply of food may become limited.
"In 1890 the census of Sitka showed about
1100 people. Of this number I think probably
150 were Americans and Europeans and the
remainder Russians and Indians. The Rus
sians, so called, are nearly all halfbreeds or
| are in some way tinctured with Indian blood.
â  The Indians in Alaska provide themselves with
i food, but the Russians are very indolent and
! seem to care nothing about providing for the
J future."
Marshal Williams brought down an|lnrtian and
a vhite man for incarceration at San Quentin,
the latter for selling liquor to Indians. When
he reached the prison there was a suggestion
j made that, as required by prison regulations,
{ his gun would be left outside. But Mr.
Williams didn't have any, nor had he had a
single weapon of any kind with him on bis en
tire trip of over 2000 miles.
lie said he couldn't have lost his prisoners if
he had wanted to, for prison life suited both
exactly. All they wanted was a place where
they could get plenty to cat and a chance to
sleep.
The white man was sent up for two years,
with $1000 fine adaitional.but under the bank
rupt law the fine will only mean an imprison
ment extra of about a month.
George Moon, Special Deputy Collector of
Customs, came down with Marshal Williams.
WHEN THE CARPET'S UP.
Tacks, tacks, tacks,
On the cold, cruv bedroom floor.
And I would that my tongue dare niter
The thoughts that In me roar.
Oh, well for the bachelor free.
As lie spoons 'neath the gaslight dim,
That he cannot look ah: al and see
The tacka which are wailing for him.
But my stately wife sleeps on
In her haven under the quilt.
With never a thought In her innocent head
Of the tacks she carelessly spilt.
Tacks, tacks, tacks.
At the foot of the foldinir-bed
Are some of the joys that houseeleaning time
Brings to the man that is wed.

LADY'S BICYCLE COSTUME.
The Ideal bicycling costume for summer is
the cloth skirt with a shirt waist. Legjrlntrs to
match the skirt are most becoming, but many
prefer cotton canvas or cotton covert cloth for
comfort.
Cotton duck, canvas, jralatea cloth, brown
Holland and the cottons which are made to
resemble covert cloth are all used for skirts,
but must be heavily faced to Insure â¢weight
enough to keep them from flying about un
comfortably. Such a skirt with legging* to
match find any sort of shirt waist makes a de
lightfully cool and chic costume for a short
spin, but for touring a cloth skirt is preferable.
One of mixed tweed with lacing of leather
was worn with canvas leggings of leather
color, the knickers were of satine of the same
shade. A flax^colored linen shirt waist com
pleted this smart outfit.
A white duck skirt, with leggings of the
same, with a white linen shirt waist, was
charming, but cannot be recommended for
anything but a dress parade.
A skirt of black with black canvas leggings,
black satine knickerbockers and a white shirt
waist with black tie and belt makes a strikingly
neat costume.
The skirt is cut circular with a bias baei
seam with the fullness laid in two forward
trimming pleats on either side, the placket be
ing at the front gore, both sides of which but
ton over the side.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
Orphan Asyltjm Childrenâ lnquirer, Oak
land, Cal. The question, "Have children be
tween 6 and 17 years old, of au orphan asylum
drawing State uid, $75 for each half orphan
and $100 for full orphan, a right to be ad-
mitted into the public schools, or must they
be taught in their own institutions?" was sub
mitted to Superintendent Babcock, who in
turn nÂ«ked for the opinion of the State Super
intendent and received the following answer:
In reply to yours of yesterday's date let me call
your attention to sections 1637 and 1638 or the
rollilca: Code, which arena follows: "1637. He
(census marshal) must include In his report alt
children who are abÃect attending Institutions of
learning and who<e parents or (ruardians arv resl
deutn of the district: he must, also include as cen
sus children the children of Indian parents who
fiayiaxesand of Indian parents who are not liv
n* In the tribal relation: he must also include nil
orphan children uhspnt from the district In orphan
Asylums whose guardians reside in the district
and every half orphan absent in asylums whose
surviving parent or guardian renides iv the dis
trict : ha must also Includeall native-born Chinese
children. 1638. He must not include in his repor:
children who are attending institutions of learn
ing, or such benevolent nstltuilons â â  deaf and
dumb, blind and orphan asylums in his district
whose parents or guardians do not reside therein."
I judge fronr. the wording of these sections that
half orphans in the various orphan asylums of San
Francisco, whose (remaining) parents reside In
said City, have been enumerated by j-our census
ruHrahals and are entitled to enter your public
schools- In the case of whole orphans or "aban
doned" children, it seems to me it would be a
proper construction of the law to conaider the
beads of the various orphan asylums as the guar
dians of such children for educational purposes,
and that they be enumerated as census children in
your City, and therefore entitled to all the privi
leges of the puolic schools of said City.
In the rase of half orphans, whose- (remaining)
parents reside outside the City, under the law.
these children are enumerated elsewhere, such
children could, however, be admitted to your
sohouls on ihe condition mentioned In subdivision
fifteenth, section 1617, which is as follows:
"Section 1617. The powers and duties of trustees
of school districts and boards of education in cities
are as follows: Fifteenthâ To permit children from
other districts to attend the schools of their dis
trict only upon the consent of the trustees of the
district In which auch chil iren reside: provided,
that sbould the trustees of the district in which
children whose parents or guardians desire them
to attend in other districts, reside, refuse to grant
their consent, the parents or guardians of :-ueh
children may appeal to the County Superintendent
and his decision shall be|6nal."
The cities of Momma o anu Los Angeles follow
the plan here fudicateu and, as a matter of fact,
the children in non-sectarian and i rotestant
orphan asylums attend the public schools ana are
taught by public school teachers. In Los Angeles
they attend the public schools In proximity to the
asyiupj. In v acrÂ»men!o the school buildings are,
I believe, on the asylum grounds, and, perhaps,
belong to ths asylum; but the teachers areengaeeci
ana paid by the city. So far as I know the chil
dren In the Catholic asylums are taught by private
teachers. Very respectfully,
Hamvkl T. BI.ACK., state Superintendent.

DOCKERY IN SAN JOSE.
The Milk Inspector's Vlult Cawiei Four
Cows to Be Killedâ Row With
Dairymen.
Milk Inspector Dockery has startled the
dairymen of Banta Clara County. He will
have none of the milk unless it be deliv
ered in the City and County of San Fran
cisco subject to the standard test.
The dairymen on the other band are
belligerent and have gone so far as to
threaten legal proceedings against the
Health Officers of San Francisco.
Dockery went to San Jose on the early
mornintr train Thursday. While the peo
pje of that city were engrossed with the
carnival he visited the slaughter-houses
and some dairies. This made the dairy
men angry and they threatened to sue the
health officials.
A consultation was held with Dr. H. A.
Spencer with the result that Dockery an
nounced that he would not let milk from
Hanta Clara County ihto San Francisco
unless it were submitted to terts. Dr.
Bpencer said that he woild not allow the
dairymen to sell milk in San Jose wherever
tubercujosis was present in the cows.
Cows affected with tiberculosis were
found by Pockery and Dr. Spencer, who
killed four cows and a sick bull.
Dockery stated last night that he would
not admit milk from any county into San
Francisco without a test.

MARKET STREET
TROLLEY CARS,
Cable to Be Supplanted by
the Rosenholz
System.
AN ECONOMIC METHOD.
No Loss of Power and Every
thing Out of Sight and
Sound.
SWITCHING OF THE CTJKRENT.
Negotiations Pending With Promi
nent Cable Companies in New
York and Chicago.
The electrical device for an underground
trolley just perfected by Alfred Rosen bolz
of this City seems destined to revolutionize
tne electric street railway systems of the
Vnited States.
The inventor, Mr. Rosenholz, being a
resident of San Francisco, naturally gave
the Market-street Railway Company the
first opportuuity for using the patent on
its numerous lines, but since then some
of the wealthiest street railway corpora
tions of the East have been bidding for
the new device. Notably among them are
a cable company of Chicago operating 150
miles of cable tracks in the windy city,
a company of Buffalo, N. V., and a promi
nent corporation of New York City.
There are a few underground trolley
systems now in operation in some of the
Eastern cities, but they have proved so
expensive that in many instances the over
head trolley has been substituted.
Therein lies the inevitable success of the
Rosenholz system. The expense is re
duced to the minimum over both the
present overhead trolley and the under
ground wire. The result is accomplished
in the simplest manner, as will appear
from a perusal of the folio wine detailed
and technical description: The under
ground trolley wire operates in sections.
After the car passes over a section the
current is shut off in that particular sec
tion by an automatic device and is not on
until the next car strikes it. It will be
seen from this that the electric current is

Wire and Switch ; "C" the Position of the Trolley Between Sections.
utilized only in that section of the trolley
over whicu the car is passing at the time.
With the present overnead and under
ground systems the current is perpetual â
constant; no laving of power can possibly
be made.
It can easily be applied to the tunnel or
conduit of any cable road, the trolley wire
displacing thecable and being attached to
automatic eUctric switches placed at
proper distances within the conduit.
These switches, which are hermetically
sealed and absolutely watertight, are at
tached to the insulated main feed wire,
and when in their normal position cut off
the current to the trolley wire. When the
trolley, which Is placed beneath the car,
depresses a switch the current passes
along a short section of the trolley wire
and the switch is held in its temporarily
depressed position by an electrc-raaenet
inclosed within it, until the next switch is
reached and similarly depressed, and so
on for the entiK length of the line.
This iugenitus and effective arrange
ment perfectly eliminates "sparking" and
renders a road bo equipped ultra economi
cal, as the trolfey wire is not charged with
electricity except when a car passes along
and depresses a switch, when, as before
stated, a sborttsection only is "alive,' 1 and
then merely for a few seconds.
This effectually prevents the enormous
waste of powerso disastrous to the finan
cial success of other underground trolley
lines and will |ermit of the profitable run
ning of roads when with any other system
of operation such would be impossible.
Through thk excellent insulation ob
tained in thiÃ jsystem, which Mr. Rosen
holz has brouf&t down to practical perfec
tion, a much higher voltage can be used
than heretofoe, resulting in the saving of
much weight Ji copper-wiring, which is a
large item of <ost in the equipping of elec
tric railways. Very ingenious and practi
cal methods for attaining his purposes
have been usÂ«d by Mr. Rosenholz as can
be seen by thl manner in which he pre
vents waste & power at points where the
conduit migjt become flooded with water
and clogged frith the refuse of the street.
It can easily be seen that the overhead
trolley wire.which is constantly charged
with electricity, cannot be nearly so econ

omical to operate as the practical switch
system herein explained. In fact, over
head electric wires are already doomed.
The authorities at Washington (D. C),
New York and Boston have ordered them
j removed, as they have become an intolera
ble nuisance in those cities. Ordinary un
derground trolley systems, so tar as their â¢.
actually doing the work is concerned, are i
now being successfully operated in the j
East and in Europe, but the mere placing j
of tne crude and unprotected live trolley
wire in a damp conduit is even less econ
omical than the overhead wire, as the sup
porting insulators, being subjected to a
constant strain and under unfavorable
climatic conditions must cause a great loss
of power every twenty-four hours and
greatly increase" the consumption of fuel
at the" power-house.
The method of Mr. Rosenholz, permit
ting only of the sectional and temporary
charging of the trolley wire, promises a
speedy revolution in the construction and
operation of electric roads.
E. H. Poehiman, who represents Mr.
I Rosenholz, said: "The Market-street
) Railway Company had the first call on the
patent, and has it yet, for that matter,
I and the system would be in operation now
were it not for certain obstacles. What
I are those obstacles? The overhead trolley
lines which the company has already
established. The company is afraid that
when the underground trolley is put in on
Market, Haight, Hayes, McAllister and
some of the other streets the property
owners along the line of the overhead
trolleys will make a demand for the new
system.
"Of course that would involve a great
expense, in addition to that which the
company has already incurred in chang
ing certain cable lines to the electric
system. â¢
"But they are bound to come to it in a
few months. The saving is something
surprising. Say the cars are ten minutes
apart, the current is on between each one
of tho switches only five seconds â that is
10 say rive seconds every ten minutes,
while the current is continuous with the
overhead trolley. In rainy weather, too,
there is a saving of 15 per cent in fuel at
the Dower-hpuse.
"Negotiations are now under way with
a cable company in Chicago operating 150
miles of road, and with companies in New
York and Buffalo. That, however, does
not interfere with the Market-street Com
pany. It has v grip on the patent anJ a
rieht to use it on the lines in this City,
and Market street is all ready to receive it.
It Leads Thoin All.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Another Record for the Trip to
Nanaimo, B. C, and Back
Broken.
THE ELWELL WINS AGAIN.
Graduating Doctors Had a Most
Pleasant Excursion Around
the Bay.
Another round-trip record between here
and Nanaimo. B. C, has been broken.
The ship Elwell made the double run from
anchorage to anchorage in 15 days 21
hours. She left here on April 22 last and
made the run to Puget Sound in six days.
Her ballast was then discharged and she
took in 2400 tons of coal. She was off the
Mendocino coast last Wednesday at noon
and at 4 p. M. last Friday was reported
frornl Point Reyes. She was hove-to oft
the whistling buoy for rine hours, and
although expected in Friday night did not
arrive until yesterday morning.
The Eiwell has been making good round
trips for some time past. She has lowered
her record on half a dozen occasions and
Captain C. Ryder is now over $600 ahead
in bonuses. On her last round trip the
Wilna made it in 16 days 6 hours and
broke the record. Captain Ryder deter- I
mined not to be beaten, and he has now
net a mark that will take a long time to
lower.
The whaleback City of Everett got in
yesterday after a run of ninety-one hours
from Puget Sound. From Cape Flattery
to within 200 miles of port a heavy south
west swell was encountered and on sev
eral occasions the vessel rolled her rails
under w ater. Tne Everett is one of the
steadiest vessels that comes into this port,
so the weather must have been pretty
heavy that caused her to roll rail under.
Cbief Officer James S. Gibson has retired
from the Everett and his place has been
taken by Captain J. B. Hastings. Mr.
Gibson has gone into the lumber business
on Vancouver Island. Among the pas
sengers on the steamer was Herman
Mahrer of Vancouver, B. C. He has never
been to San Francisco in his life before
and he is just down on a visit to see what
the metropolis of the Pacific Coast is like.
The Fish Commissioners' steamer Alba
tross sailed for the Santa Barbara channel
yesterday. During the trial trip of the
Oregon she will be used as a stake boat,
and when that service is over she will go
direct to Bering Sea. All the trial board
will be on board the battle-ship to-night,
and at nigh water in the morning she will
start for tbe proving ground. Of course,
if the present Heavy westerly swell con
tinues and the bar is breaking, she will
not attempt to go out, as the contractors
will take no risks.
The report of heavy weather on the
coast is borne out by the report of the
captain of the steamer Coos Bay. She was
nearly thirty-six hours late, and at times
she foiled "the passengers out of their
bunks. There was one cabin and three
steerage passengers, and they all say it
was the roughest passage they ever had.
It rolled the ink out of tbe bottles and
ruined half tbe purser's manifests, so if
the Oregon goes out this morning there
will be a good test of her sea-going quali
ties.
The Rufus E. Wood, with a load of coal
for the Dunsmuirs, attempted to dock at
Folsom 2 yesterday. She stuck in the
mud when a few feet from the wharf and
had to WBit for the next tide before she
could get up to the bunkers.
The stock of Australian coal is very low
in thjs market and the chances are that in
a few weeks it will be completely exhausted.
There is a strike on in the Newcastle col
lieries and vessels are leaving there every
day in ballast. The Golden Snore, Pal
myra, Sewsboy, Sonoma and Harvester are
now on their way either to Honolulu to
load sugar or to Puget Sound to load
lumber. Only one American vessel is
likely to get a load and that is the Colusa.
She is under charter and will simply lie at
the wharf claiming demurrage until the
cargo is put aboard.

the California Medical College last week

President Colnon of the Harbor Com
mission is determined to have cvii service
in full swing on the water front before he
leaves office. As a move in the right
direction he intends having a resolution
introduced at the next Legislature which
will put the new rule in force. There is
no intention of making a continuous job
for Democrats, as President Colnon in
tends to make the resolution read that
half the appointees shall be Republicans
and half Democrats. "It is the only way
in which we can reduce the taxation on
shipping," said Mr. Colnon yesterday.
"At the present time the expenses for
whartineers and collectors is too heavy,
and while I am satisfied that they are all
most efficient men still I think we could
do with a less number. It will cost a mil
lion to finish the seawall, and we are pay
ing interest on the $600,000 for the ferry. In
order to make a saving and reduce ship
ping rates then we must begin with civil
service reform."
LIFE AT THE CHUTES.
Japanese Parachutes to Be Given Away

The chntes will be reopened this after
noon after being shut down for five days,
during which time the extensive improve

have been inaugurated. The scenic rail
way, whicli is to be nearly iwo-thirds of a
mile long, is springing up in sections, and
advantage has been taken o: the closing to
â¢â¢wash the water."
To-day all the children attending will be
presented with a Japanese parachute,
which created such a sensation among the
little ones on Mayday.
To-morrow a brand new balloon will be
launched for the first time, with appropri

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The roads in the country are now m ex
cellent condition for bicycling, and a num
ber of riders will take advantage of an
outing to-morrow.
The sportsmen who are interested in
target shooting will assemble at the Oak
land racetrack to-morrow, where a num
ber of clay bird races will be held.
The anglers hope to meet with good
success to-morrow, as tbe streams are in
good condition, the result of a recent spell
of fine weather.
There will be some good coursing at
Ingleside park to-morrow.
In handball circles the match for the
championship of the coast between
Riordan ana Harlow is the principal
topic.
Rifle shooting, rowing, cricket and all
round atliletics are being well patronized.
THE WHEELMEN.
The Races at San Jose To-Day Will
Be a Great Attraction.
Track racing for 1896 has begun in earn
est, and from now on there will be race
J. F. Morris, Pest President of the San
Francisco Koad Club.
meets at short intervals. It is proposed to
hold a meet every Saturday afternoon and
evening on the new track at Central Park
and the racers are already beginning to
talk about the great league meet to be held
in Potaluma on July 4 and 5.
To-day the best of the National circuit
meets thus far held will be conducted by
the Garden City Cyclers at San Jose, and
the entry list, already published in The
Call, shows the names of some of the
fastest riders in the State. In the profes
sional events particularly the races and
iiniahes are expected to be exceedingly
close and desperate, as the men fighting
for money prizes do so with a great deal
more spirit than when the trophies were
second-class diamonds and uncertain jew
elry.
Most of the riders and visitors from this
City who intend going to San Jose will
take either tbe 8:15 or 10:40 A. m. broad
gauge trains this morning, the trip taking
two hours. The railroad has made a
round-trip excursion fare of $1 70 for the
trip, good on all trains until Monday,
the 11th.
Next week there are two particular
events in which the wheelmen will take
interest. First conies the Olympic Cyclers'
entertainment, dance and minstrel show,
to be held at Native Sons' Hali Thursday
evening. The Cyclers are one of the most
popular wheeling clubs in the City, and
from far and near their friends will come
to join with them in the merry time to be
had Thursday evening. It goes without
Baying that the entertainment will be par
excellence, as the club contains many tal
ented amateurs and can have the pick of
the best in the City, and the dance, which
will be made the feature of the evening,
will commence early and end earlyâ in the
morning.
Saturday the National circuit riders will
contest on the Central Park track. The
earne men who will ride to-day at San Jose
will compete there next week, so that those
who cannot spare the time to make the
San Jose trip to-day have yet a chance of
peeing some of this exciting sport right at
home. The San Francisco wheelmen
should support the new track liberally as
it has been greatly needed and will help
the sport and trade here materially.
R. M. Welch, member of the National
Racing Board in California, has issued
another of his interesting bulletins as fol
lows:
* BULLETIN NO. 9.
Saw Francisco, May 8, 1896.
Sanctions grantedâ May 12, Garden City Cy
cling Club, Missoula, Mont.; May 20, the
Butchers' Board of Trade, Oakland, Cal.;
Steams team to make private record trials at
San Jose, Cal., May 6 to 15, inclusive.
Transferred to professional class â Russell

Evans of Santa Monica, under clause A.
Suspendedâ H. F. Terrill, San Francisco, un
der truck rule 15. H. M. Welch,
Member National Racing Board.
The suspension of Harry Terrill of the
Bay City Wheelmen by the racing board
is for the non-payment of a fine of $20
levied upon him by Referee Plummer at
the Santa Rosa races last Saturday. Ter
rill feels that the action of the referee was
hardly called for and declares be will not
pay the penalty. The whole trouble is as
follows^ The referee placed a time limit
on all fbe scratch events to prevent the
riders from loafing. In some cases where
the limit was exceeded by a second or two
he overlooked it, as it was evident that the
â¢men obeyed the spirit of the rule if not the
letter. But in one instance where the
limit was exceeded some twenty seconds,
and the race was palpably a "loaf," he dis
qualified the men in that heat and would
not allow them to ride in the final. Ter
rill iB then reported to have told Plnmmer,
in a voice loud enough for every one
around to hear, that he was a "bum" ref
eree and was showing favoritism, where
upon he was at once fined $20, a power
given the referee under the new racing
rules. This is the first instance of the
kind on record and the outcome will be
awaited with interest.
W. C. Brode of the Bay City Wheelmen
has returned from a trip to Los Angeles.
George Andrews, Emil Languetin and
Robert Reed, of the same club, left Thurs
day night to ride to Angels Camp, Cala
veras County, where they will visit the
TJtica mine and other points of interest,
returning next week.
The Camera Club Cyclists held their an
nual meeting last Thursday evening. The
report of the officers showed the club to be
in a prosperous condition. The election
of officers resulted as follows: Charles A.
Adams, president; Mrs. H. C. Cantwell,
vice-president; H. C. Owens, secretary; H
C. Cantwell, treasurer; J. J. B. Argenti
captain ; Walter N. Brunt, first lieutenant ;
A. G. MacFarland, second lieutenant The
president and captain succeeded them
eelves in office as their tenure of office
during the past term had been particu
larly satisfactory to the members. After
the business of the meeting was concluded
the ladies and gentlemen of the club en
joyed a game of progressive euchre and
some light refreshments.
H. yon der Leith of the Golden
City Wheelmen desires a companion
for a- wheeling trip to Los Ange
les, to follow the route laid out
in tbe League of American Wheel
men's road oook. His address is corner of
l'owell and Broadway, City. A Mr. tfrit
tain of Lios An.ele*, who recently made
the trip from that point to here, says that
the league book is particularly accurate
over that part of the State, and as the
roads are all fair the trip is most enjoya
ble if taken leisurely.
The American Wheelman, the leading
weekly cycling journal of the East, pub
lished in New York City, will begin the
publication of a daily cycling paper there
on May 24. In the prospectus it is stated
that there are to-day over 100,000 cyclists
in the metropolitan district, and more
than three million in the United States,
and even these figures are said to be con
servative estimates.
The Golden Gate Cycling Club will give
an entertainment and dance at Mission
Parlor Hall, Saturday evening, May 23,
for wi.ich invitations have just been issued
and may be secured from any of the mem
bers.
The Citrus Wheelmen of Los Angeles
have opened quarters at Santa Monica,
and I am in receipt of an invitation to at
tend their "house-warming" Sunday, May
10, at 11 a. m. The club is probably the
most prosperous organization in the south,
and with their new home by the sea and
contiguous to the great Santa Moniua race
track the members will be well cared for.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen have two
runs called for to-day and to-morrow. A
party will co down to San Jose this morn
ing under Lieutenant Plagemann, leaving
on the 7:30 a. m. broad-gauge boat, to
see the Garden City Cyclers" races. To
morrow's run will be to the same point to
witness the shoot between teams from the
Olympic Gun Club and Garden City Cy
clers, leaving on the Ba. m. boat. A week
from to-morrow the wheelmen will have a
joint run with the Acme Club Wheelmen
of Oakland, and Captains Fawcett and
Swain are now arranging the details.
I am in receipt of a very newsy letter
from R. P. Aylward, the manager of Otto
Zieeler Jr., the crack racer, and it contains
so much of interest I will give it in full:
LorisviLLE, Ky., May 1, 1896.
My Dear Spalding: Here we are at work
again and a ruore pieasam place for condition
ing could not be found. San Jose is no com
parison. The pnrk and surroundings offer
attractions enough to keep the boys on the
ground all the time and they seldom po np
town, thereby getting better results from their
track work. The track is an elegant three-lap
cement surface ana resembles that of the
Garden City Cyclers, only the stretches are
longer.
We will remain here until Otto is in the very
best condition, and it may be late in June
before we take up the circuit. In the mean- |
time we will take in several of the meets not
on the circuit. Cincinnati gives a meet on the
9th inÂ«t., also on the ltith. Many of the boya
Will take these in.
Cooper, who has been training here, has re-

and Who Win Also Judge the Oakland Show.
moved to Cincinnati. Bald, Gardiner, Ziegler
and many of the others will remain until a day
or so before the Cincinnati meet and will
return here after it is over.
1 have been giving Otto all unpaced work up
to the present writing, and will now put him
in with Gardiner to ride together. He has
been ridine very strong unpaced, and this
wort will enable nim to ride a good handicnp
race. It is my opinion that handicap races
will be the feature of the '96 circuit, so I am
preparing him for them. There is tome talk
of dropping the paced race, and. if this should
be the case, he will be bettered by doing this
unpaced work. Otto is taking excellent care
of himself and will make a lively competitor
for any one on the Natinnnl circuit. He and
Gardiner are very much 'he favorites here in
Louisville. This is probably due to the good
w ork they did when after records last fall.
Gardiner is also riding well and will be one
of the crowd to compete at Cincinnati. In
build be greatly resembles Allan Jones, and
has about the same tactics and style of riding.
Hardly an effort is shown even while doing a
sprint.
Bald has just begun training, and is doing
unpaced work altogether. Homer Fairmon,
the long-distance crack, is here under the in
structions of the veteran trainer, John West,
who is preparing him for his match races with
Lawson, the "terrible Swede."
Pat O'Connor is also in training here, and
will compete with the "pros." on the circuit.
Yours sincerely, R. p. aylwaed.
The San Francisco Road Club installed
its newly elected officers last Tuesday
evening. Ex-President Sands introduced
the new presiding officer, O. R. Sterling
and the retiring officer, I. P. Morris, was
heartlljr commended for the interest he has
taken in the clab and the work he lias
done for it during his term of office. Can
tain Pixley, who was re-elected unani
mously, has not called a run for to-mor
row, us most of the members will attend
the races at San Jose to-day and stay over
Sunday. Spalding.
ATHLETIC.
Death of a Prominent Athleteâ The
Boxing Craze Has Arrived.
The Olympic Club lost one or Its
stanchest members yesterday morning.
Frank G. Phillips, who held the title of
amateur champion middle and heavy
weight wrestler of the Pacific Coast, died
at his home, 1943 Howard street, of pneu
monia. Tbe young athlete was ailing
only a few days. He contracted a severe
cold, which developed into pneumonia,
that quickly brought his life on this earth
to an end. Phillips won tbe amateur
wrestling championship on the 21st of
March last at the Olympic Club by defeat
ing every athlete he competed against.
Professor Miehiing, the wrestling in
structor, predicted a very brilliant future
for young Phillips. Tue deceased was 21
years of asre.
James Williams, the champion heavy
weight pugilist of Jtaa, is anxious to meet
Tom Sharkey in a ten-round contest in
this City. The National Club may secure
the match. Sharkey is considering a re
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
turn match with Choynski. The sailor
seems to be in big demand about this time
by the many managers who have secured
permits for the holding of boxing exhibi
tions. .
It is sail that Eddie Graney, Young
Mitchell and the manager of the Peoples
Palace are looking for fighters. The old
time boxing craze is evidently here, and
everything pugilistically will go along
swimmingly for a short time, when the
"cooks" will get to quarreling, and that
will end the game of fisticuffs*
It was reported yesterday that "Fatty"
Blodes, "Spider" Kelly and many other
"prominent citizens" were in hopes of se
curing permits for boxing exhibitions.
The Olympic, Club is making arrange
ments to hold another boxing tournament
on August 15.
m
COURSING.
The Interstate Club Will Hold Two
Days' Meeting at Ingleslde.
The Interstate Coursing Ciub is making
extensive preparations fora grand inclosed
meeting, which will be held at lngleside
Park on May 30 and 31.
The ground is in magnificent condition
for coursinc, ami the hares, which have
become thoroughly familiar with the park,
will certainly make the grass fly in front
of the fleetest of their pursuers. Ingle
side Park is an ideal spot lor coursing.
The spectator who is comfortably seated
in the grand stand can see every twist and
turn of a race from start to finish. It must
be remembered that the best of order is
maintained at meetings held under the
auspices of the Interstate Club, and for
this reason large numbers of ladies are
always present to witness the racing and
enjoy the sport of kings.
A 64-dog stake at $5 a dog, to which
the club will add $100, will be the
feature of greatest interest on this near
future occasion. A puppy stake at $5
each, with an added $25, will also be run.
It can be safely said that any person who
is desirous of witnessing a first-class two
days' outing, where the very best of de
corum is observed, should not miss the
next coursing meeting of the Interstate
Clnb.
John Grace, the prince of coursinp
judges, will be in the saddle on the two
days of the meeting and J. F. Grace, the
crack pedestrian, will handle the slips.
At the opening of the Insleside track on
the 3d inst. there were fully two thousand
people present, and it is expected that
twice that number will witness the inter
state coursing club's meeting.
The dogs that will run for the consola
tion stakes at Ingleside Park will be
"drawn" on the gr.unds to-morrow (Sun
day) immediately after the first round in
the regular stake is finished. J. P. Dalton,
proprietor of the park, will add $20 to the
s:ake. Of course, nonp but dogs defeated
in the regular stake can enter for the con
solation.
THE ANGLERS.
Mountain Streams That Are In Good
Condition for Fishing:.
Latest intelligence from towns in th
country that are within easy reach Of
trout-fishing waters is to the effect that
the creeks are now running very clear and
in good order lor fly-fishing. The weather
has been so bad during the past week that
few anglers anticipate success in fly-cast
ling to-morrow. The cold north wind baa
killed off the winged insects, and it can be
i safely said that until a spell of warm air
arrives top fishing will not be good.
Borae very nice catches of trout were
I made during the week on Lake Lapunitas.
Al Gumming and Frank Marcus returned
from the mountain lake recently with
well-filled baskets of trout.
The anglers were in hoDe that the San
Andreas Lake would open on June 1, bnt
the directors, at a recent meeting, decided
to keep the big pond closed until July 1 â¢
The trout are certainly in better condition
in April, May and June when the water is
: cold. Anglers should not expect that the
! fish they will catch in the lakes in July
and August, when the water is lukewarm
to be firm and in good condition for table
use. Certainly, in lake fishing, the best
sport is invariably had during the iÂ»arly

months of the season, but seemingly fie
Spring Valley water people have their own
views of this subject and can open and
close the lakes at wili. *
The anglers who fished the Paper-mill
and Lagunitns creeks last Sunday caught
a first-class wetting, but they did not
grumble at that. It was the delay oc
casioned by the railroad company at
Snusalito that they growled at. Those who
traveled in the first train from Point Rejvs
on Su.iday evening, had to waitatSuusalito
in the cold and damp weather until the
last down train arrived, when all passen
gers were taken on board the boat for this
City, where they arrived at a very late
hour in company of a lot of boisterous
picnickers.
With the return of bright, sunny days,
anglers can assur dly hope for first-cla^s
fishing in the streams between Cloverdale
and Ukiah. The Pieta and Big Sulphur
creeks should be in splen'lid order for fly
fishing now, and in all probability there
will be many anplers whipping those pretty
streams before the month draws to a close.
THE RIFLE.
H. Kenltzor Has Made Some Excel
lent Scores at Rest-Shooting:.
H. Kenitzer, an old-time rifleman of
this coast, has been doiii,: some remarka
ble shooting of late, notwithstanding the
fact that he has almost reached his seven
tieth year. During the past ten days Mr.
Kenitzer has been practicing at the Shell
Mound rifle tange. He has several fine
rifles, but of late he has obtained the best
results with a 32-caliber Pope barrel, tele
scope sight, shooting with a rest at
200 yards. Kenitzer uses black powder
with a nitro primer.
On the 2d inst. he made a score in ten '
shots of which he justly feels proud and
which is here reproduced, reduced one
third. He made '2i6 on the 25-ring target.
This is equal to 20 on Columbia target and
111 on the'standard American. This shows
an average of 24 3-10 rings. On that oc
casion he made a run of 40 shots, with

excellent scores for any one, and particu
larly for one who has reached such a ripe
age, they cannot be accepted as a record,
because they were not shot on a rest rec
ord target. Considering Mr. Kenitzer's
fine shooting, it is a pity the scores were
not made on a record target, the Standard
American being the only target with a
rest center. In the East a number of clubs
are making rest records on the new Colum
bia target on the 100-yard ranges, and
when the weather permits outdoor shoot
ing, they will, no doubt, uae this target for
rest records.

Regatta Committee Appointed by
the South End Boat Club.
The El Campo regatta on Decoration
day is the only thing talked of in boating
circles. It has increased the interest in
rowing here to a marked degree, and every
evening and on Sunday mornings the
wharves in the vicinity of Lonj; Bridge
and North Beach are crowded with enthu
siastic admirers of the strong-armed
pullers of the different clubs, watching
them undergo their training and outing.

The South End Boat Clnb, under whose
auspices the affair is to be held, had an
enthusiastic reeatta meeting last evening,
and elected the following for a regatta
committee: J. E. Scully, chairman; J. D.
Mahoney, secretary; Joseph ODea, treas
urer; Al J. Fritz, William O'Brien, J. A.
Lenahan, J. J. McCarthy, I. P. Shortball,
A. J. Mellitz, T. F. Barry, D. J. Gorham,
William J. Daily, Bob McArthur, William
Thomas and D. D. Connolly.
The senior race of this regatta, it is
feared, will be a disappointment, as none
of the clubs with but one exception, the
Alameda Boat Club, and it is yet unde
cided, have so far organized a senior crew.
But it is thought that the winning junior
crew will enter the senior event, and
thereby give the public a chance to see the
South End's celebrated crew row.
The single scull race between William
McCausland, Frank Duplissea and Jack
Caughlin will undoubtedly be the greatest
amateur scull event seen on the bar in
years.
Duplissea is the recognized senior cham
pion of the coast. Caughlin defeated all
comers in the outrigger skiff events of last
season and McCausland is considered a
wonder with the spoons.
Henry Peterson, the Pacific Coast cham
pion single sculler, is taking an interest in
youne McCausland. and George Duplissea,
the celebrated tug-of-war athlete and stroke
of the South End professional barge crew
is putting his son in condition.

SACRAMENTO. Cal., May 8.-The
Sacramento Athletic Clnb will begin a
series of competitive handball eames this
month, to be conducted on a handicap
basis. Valuable trophies will be awarded
to the teams securing first and second
places.
Under the administration of the new
board of directors the club has prospered
materially of late. The efforts of President
Anderson and Secretary Gormley have
been such as to result in a rapid increase
in membership and collection of dues.
There is an important movement on foot
looking to the establishment of a general
athletic club grounds at East Park, in this
city, to comprise a bicycle-track, 100-yard
cinder path, football and baseball grounds,
with seat 3 for spectators, etc., all to be in
closed. A preliminary meeting was held
last night and it la thought that the
scheme will be perfected.
L. A. Upson and Jerome Carroll left for
Marysviile this morning to attend the live
bird and bluerock tournament and to taka
part in the tennis games held there to-day.
The postponed relay race between the
S tockton and Sacramento Bicycle clubs is
slated to take place to-morrow. The start
will be from Tenth and L streets in this
city, to Stockton and return, a distance of
100 miles. Pope, one of Sacramento's fast
est riders, met with an accident during
practice and will be unable to start.
The Capital City blue- rock team, which
has been selected to represent the club at
the Stockton tournament, are having d lily
practice at the traps and are in excellent
form.
The Spoonbill Club will make applica
tion for admittance to tbe California
Inanimate Target Association, and if
granted in time it will also send a team to
the Stockton tournament. At their regu
lar prize shoot, held last Sunday, 25 birds,
Eckhardt s ored 24, Thomas 23, Fitzgerald
22. Soule and Flohr 20 each. During the
day" Thomas made the best score ever
made in Sacramento County, breaking 100
birds out of a possible 105.
At the Eckhardl tournament on Sunday
last Nicolaus won first money in the open
ing event, a 15-bird contest, wi'.h a -core of
14. Second event, 25 birds, resulted as fol

OF CORPORATIONS.
Judge Garber's Strong
Ground in the Rail
road Case.
STATEMENT OF RIGHTS.
Judge McKenna Talks Back and
Points Law With Farmers
and Ox Teams.
A POLE STAR FOE THE COURTS.
Two Features of a Day in Court
With State and Corporate Con
flicting Rights.
A momentous battle over what shall be
the taw of this great land on the funda
mental rights of States and corporations
in their common relations was going on in
the United States Circuit Court during
two hours yesterday afternoon.
It marked the very near approach of the
end of the present struggle between the
Southern Pacific Railroad corporation and
the Railroad Commission, or rather the
State of California. Yesterday was ex
pected to bring an end to the tedious argu
ments, but Judge Garber, Â«vho is making
the closing address, will not finish until
next Tuesday, when the case will come
up again.
Of course what was going on in the Cir
cuit Court was bat a part of the mo
mentous battle referred to. But this
pending case is the latest one of the similar
contests between great railroad corpora
tions and- States which have tried to regu
late them, which began but a few years
ago, and it will be an important factor in
a final result of National importance.
Judge McKenna's decision wiJ become
one of the "decisions' 1 in tue jurisprudence
of corporations to be quoted in accord
ance with the crasp and learning which
the man on the bench displays. The
court is but oue remove from the one of
last resort, where the evidence, arguments
and decision wiil be reviewed and provide
more law on the great issue.
So it was deeply important lawmakin?
â¢which was going on yesterday, as It has
been for so many weeks. All the vital law
in the case is provided by the decisions of
recent years. These decisions have con
strued constitutional and inherent rights
of persons. States and property, reversed,
modified and elaborated each other, and
bo gradually evolved to its present stage
the law on State control of corporations.
It is because this evolution isstiil in prog
ress, as . Judge Garber interestingly
showed, and because this case will possi
bly advance it another stage, that the case
has an importance besides that involved
in the question of whether or not the
fcfiat,e of California can regulate its rail
roads with more than meie police power.
There were not a dozen people in the
chilly and quiet courfroom. For two hours
Judge Garber talked at the Judge and got
talked back to, while Judge Hayne now
and then interrupted with a vital ques
tion, and W. F. Merrin, District Attorney
Foote ond two or three other attorneys
Bilently and intently followed the argu
ment, which two stenographers were wig
glingjdown.
All this tremendous array of argument
in this case is interesting to corporation
lawyers. Scattered through it are facts
and ideas of general interest if they are
got hold of. But the dry elucidation of
decisions and the disputing about consti
tutional and common law and inherent
rights and all that is no circus to many
people.
But some days are more interesting than
others in the Circuit Court, as elsewhere,
and yesterday was a highly interesting '
one.
What: went on yesterday was exception
ally interesting lor two thines which were j
the maiu features of the proceedings. Judge '
Garber boldly, strongly and insistently
proclaimed the doctrine of the sovereignty
of the corporation in the use of its prop- i
erty. He declared, in effect, that the rail
road could charge a million dollars an
ounce a mile for Hauling freight if it
wanted to, so long as it didn't discrimin
ate unjustly or commit extoriion by cinch
ing some poor fellow for $2,000,000 an
ounce, if it got a chance to do so. Jud^e
Garber put the corporation doctrine of its
independent rights under the Federal con
stitution and its denial of the rights of
the State to interfere with the free nse of
its property in a stronger way than they
have been put during the argument.
The other feature of the day was an in
teresting colloquy between Judge Garber
and the court on the limitations of the
power of the State to regulate the cor
poration in the use of its property on one
hand, and the extent of the conflicting
property rights of the corporation on the
other.
During this colloquy a layman could see
the vitallegal issue in the case stand out
clearly and alone. The incident was a
cathodopraph of the very inside of the
issue and of the partly formed legal doc
trine of vast significance which the courts
are slowly elaborating.
Where is the dividing line between the
two rights set in oppositionâ the right of
the State to regulate the corporation in i
the use of its property and the ri?ht of the
corporation to its property? Does the I
right of the State end, as the Southern Pa- I
cine contends, with the exercise of police
powers in preventing wronps of discrimi- ]
nation and the like, or may it go to the I
extent of regulating prices to the point of
confiscation, and what is confiscation?;
The takine away of one dollar which t he
corporation might be able to earn by force
of monopoly or only the cutting down o f
its income to a j oint below a "reasonable"
return on its capital? Has a railroad a
right to stiÂ« out for any price for the use
of its property as a hotel man might for
the rent of his rooms, and does the Federal
constitution warn the State to let the cor
poration alone in this right? There is a
tangle of other tilings in tne case, of
course, but these wire the questions that
stuck out of yestercay's proceedings, and
they are the vital ones of the litigation.
In beginning his aidress Judge Garber
went at a lot of the decisions that have
been mauled about bo much during the
argument and argued that the later ones
greatly modified the earlier ones.
"In the tirst opinion on this issue the
court said that final power must lodge
somewhere, and that it should be in the
legislative power of the State and not in
the courts, said the alvocate. "It fol
lowed that the hundreds of millions of
property in Illinois was subject to the
arbitrary power of the Legislature, with
'. no appeal bat to the ba.lot-box. Bat it
. was recognized that prope-ty is safe from
â  popular emotion and coitrol. But in
.- cases following the Supretie Court said.
. 'We must not" be understood as goinz so
far.' They said that in those cases the
rea-onableness of the ra*e? was not an
issue. Tney conceded power to the Legis
lature, bat said there was a li-nit to which
it could go.
"What was that limit? In e constitu
tion of the United States, whfcb says that
property shall not be taken w\thont com
pensation and that no rerson *ball be de
prived of the equal protection cf the laws.
"The power of the Railroad Commission
in this State is limited by the provision
that private property shall not be taken
without compensation. It cannot trench
on the perfect right of private property aa
fixed by the constitution.
"If I own a piece of property that own
ership goes to all the enjoyment that
springs from it. Yon cannot take from
me the earning capacity any more than
the property itself.''
"Could any rates be reduced one-tenth
of a cent without it being confiscation?"
asked Judge Hayne.
"That depends. The limitation is that
you must not under pretense of 'regula
tion' accomplish confiscation. There is
ample scope for regulation under the de
cisions of the Supreme Court. The court
has said that the police power of the State
may be exercised in cases of extortion, in
wrongful uso of propertyâ its use aa a nui
sance! That is the limitation under the
latest decisions; but you must not impair
the rights of property."
The courtâ Suppose a railroad Is con
structed through a region where teams are
the only other means of compensation.
The rates will be regulated, we will say, by
the laws of supply and demand you speak
of. The supply is the supply of railroads;
the demand is the demand of the farmers
for railroads. Can that railroad charge
the highest rates t .at that supply and
demand will allow without forcing the
farmers to the use of ox- teams?
Judge Garber-It can. It has the right
to charge the highest rate that will be
paid. The power of regulation comes in
preyentlng discrimination. Will your
Honor say that with my railroad I may
not charge all that the farmers will pay
me, without resorting to ox-teams or to
competition?
Tiie courtâWhat shall be the test of
regulation? Shall it be the railroad's
power to earn without regulation?
Garberâ l say so. ...
The courtâ What becomes of regulation?
Garberâ The power of regulation is ap
plied to exceptional instances, when some
particular wrong is done.
The court â Suppose the railroad com
pany fixes its rate, which it applies equally
to all. You say that the value of the road
depends on its ability to get that rate.
Wticre. then, can regulation come in, the
railroad having made no discriminations?
Garberâ The company is entitled to the
highest rate the people will pay. Why
shouldn't they resort to teams?
There was more of this, the court saying
that it was not prepared to go as far as the
advocate was going. Judge Garber eluci
dated further his contention that the
latest decisions confirmed the doctrine
that the State power ol regulationwas a
police one and that the property right was
the higher and more sacred one.
"This doctrine of the limitations to the
State's power has not sprung full-fledged
from the minds of the courts," Garber
said. "The courts are feeling their way to
it. The power of regulation was first
stated in the Munn case, and then this
power of regulation swallowed up the
riuhts of property. The question is,
Where is the dividing line between these
conflicting powers? The higher right is
the rigiu of property, and this has been
recognized in later decisions."
The courtâ The question is, Where does
the power of regulation end and the right
of property begin ? If the State has the
powerof regulation it must have the right
to exercise it. Does not this power extend
past extortion?
Judge Garber â It does not. The value
of property is its earning capacity. Since
the Munn'case the courts are finding their
way to the true principle that when the
power of regulation comes in conflict with
constitutional guarantees it must fall
back. This nas been the pole star of the
courts in their progress through these
cases. What matters if you say ttiis limits
the power of regulation? The full value
of property must be preserved under
normal and usual conditions, without
wrong.
These expressions are typical of the chief
arguments yesterday afternoon.
BABY BROWNING'S FATHER
Flynn, Who Is Accused of Murder,
Being Examined Before
Judge Low.
Some Important Additional Testimony
Elicited From Witnesses
Yesterday.
The case of the People vs. J. T. Fiynn,
charged with the murder of the Browning
baby found dead in a valise, came on for
examination in Judge Low's court yester
day afternoon.
With two or three exceptions the testi
mony did not differ materially from that
offered at the Coroner's inquest. These
exceptions may prove very material to the
defendant.
After Dr. Fitzgibbon of the Receiving
Hospital had given his evidence relative
to the condition of the dead babe when
brought to the hospital, the probable
number ef its few short hours on earth,
etc.. Dr. Quigley.the physician in atten
dance at the birth, testified to some im
portant facts that were not brought out at
the inquest. Among other things he said
that he felt a little dubious about tbe wel
fare of the infant and asked Mrs. Shane,
the sister ol Mrs. Browning, if sne would
look alter the babe. Mrs. Shane^repljed in
the affirmative and volunteered the infor
mation that she was accustomed to take
care of children of instant a^e.
When the doctor left the house he in
trusted tbe baby to the care of tais wo
man.
Mrs. Browning's testimony as to the
time of the child's birth and its taking
away by Flynn was the same on direct ex
amination as tnat offered at the inquest.
On cross-examination by Attorney Knight
for the defense she wavered somewhat and
finally broke down, necessitating the con
tinuance of the'ease until this morning.
When a*ked why she had the baby placed
in a bureau drawer instead of in the bed be
side her she hesitated and finally answered
that she thought the drawer would be a
good cradle for it.
A question relating to the certainty of
her knowledge of Flynn 'a paternal con
nection with tbe child, coupled witn a
delicate query as to the number of her in
timate male acquaintances, brought tears
and an adjournment.
The case will go on this mo rning.
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION.
Stanford University Professors Read a
Series of Interesting Lectures.
Stanford University was well represented
at the meeting of the Library Association
of Central California in the lecture-room
of the Mechanics' Institute last evening.
A number of papers appertaining to the
foundation and management of the great
libraries of the world were read.
"The Library of the British Museum"
was the subject ol an instructive paper,
read by Professor George Kriehn. This
lecture was followed by a discourse on
"The Literature of Libraries'' by F. J.
Tesrgart, librarian of Stanford University.
"Nooks in the Bookland of Boston" by
Professor Jphn W. Stillman concluded the
interesting entertainment.
Last evening's meeting was the last
until next September, and in the inter
vening time another series of lectures will
be prepared for the winter season.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
THEY MUST WAIT
FOR THEIR MONEY.
Latest Decision in the Fam
ous Hale & Norcross
Case.
A JUDGMENT DELAYED.
The Affirmed Finding Can Be
Entered Only on a Final
Decision.
EXPLAINING A FORMER OPINION
JuiJge H?bbard's Order Regarding the
$210,197 Reversed by the Su
preme Court
The Supreme Court has rendered an
other decision in the Hale & Norcross
case â one that further complicates the
great damage suit and delays alt chance of
securing the benefit of one judgment until
he whole case has been settled.
The decision is quite a blow to the hopes
of certain stockholders; it means that the
|210,197 50 for which judgment was ren
dered by Judge Hebbard, and which the
Supreme Court takes pains to say was a
good judgment, must remain in abeyance
until the whole case has been settled.
This may mean a long time, and it will
probably be months at least before it is
finally turned over to its rightful owners.
When the case came up in the Superior
Court there were two charges of fraud
made, upon each of which the plaintiffs
sought to recover. One was for excessive
charges for milling, the other was for
fraudulent milling. The judgment of the
court was for the plaintiffs for over a
million dollars, $225,000 of which was for
excessive charges and the remainder for
fraudulent returns on the milled ores.
On appeal the judgment for $225,000 #as
scaled down to $210,197 00, and at that
amount it was affirmed. The other judg
ment was reversed because the Supreme
Court believed there haa not been suf
ficient testimony taken on which to base
such a judgment.
The case was sent back to Judge Heb
bard, and accompanying it was an opinion
containing this paragraph:
The Judgment appealed from is Ret aside and
the Superior Court" is directed to enter a Judg
ment as of the date of its former Judgment
against Alvinza Ilay ward and H. M. Levy for
the sum of $210,197 50, with interest from
that date, upoa the iss.ue presented by the
claim for having paid an excessive price for
milling the ore in the Mexican and Nevada
mills, and upon that issue the order denying
a new trial as to these defendants is nflirnied.
As to tne other appellants, except the Nevada
Mill and Mining Company, the order denying
anew trial as to this issue is reversed and a
new trial thereon ordered. Upon the issue
presented by the claim for damages sustained
3>- reason of the imperfect and fraudulent mill
ing, the order denying a new trial i-, set aside
as to all the appellants and the court is di
rected upon the evidence a 1a 1 ready taken in the
case, and such o'her evidence as maybe pre
sented by either party, to make unriinpa in ac
cordance with the views hereinbefore ex
piested.
Judfre Hebbard read the opinion and
entered the judgment as directed for
$210,197 50, and he set the other issue for
trial. Hayward and the others de
murred, for they said Judge JTebbard
could not enter the judgment until the
case had been decided upon every issue.
Fox, the plaintiff, showed the decision anl
said it could be done; Hayward et al.
showed the decision and said it could not
be done, but the order was made, and
Hayward and Hobart appealed from it.
For half a day learned attorneys argued
before the Supreme Court, asking that the
Judges explain themselves. Haywani's
attorneys argued long to show t!;at the
Supreme Court could have meant noth
ing else but that the affirmed judgment
should wait, and Fox's attorney, \V. T.Â«
Baggett, simply showed the decision and
asked the Judges to say what they did
mean.
The Judges were not prepared to ex
plain, so the matter was taken under ad
visement. The conrt has considered the
matter for some months, and now it is an
nounced that when the court said to enter
the judgment, it did not mean to enter the
judgment, it meant to hold the judgment
until the case should be finally decided
and then enter it.
In rendering its explanatory opinion
the Supreme Court says:
It is certain that the cases, if there are any,
which can be taken out of the general rule
above stated, that but one Judgment, linal in
effect if not in form, can be entered, must be
altogether exceptional and dependent upon
j-ome especial considerations. > o such consid
erations have been brought to our attention in
this case, nor were any such referred to in our
former opinion. In construing our former
judgmeni, therefore, the fair presumption is
that no direction to enter a final judgment on
some of the issnes, in advance of the trial oa
the remaining issues, was Intended.
On examining the terms of that Judgment
we are unable to find any plain or distinct di
rection of that kind. The court below was di
rected to enter a Judgment as of the date of its
former judgment, on the issue as to which a
new trial was denied ; and as to the remaining
issues a new trial was granted. No direction
was given as to when the particular judgment
should be entered; and tfte presumption is
that it was intended that it should be entered
at the same time as, and should constitute a
part of, the final judgment to be rendered on
oil the issues in the case, in accordance with
the general coarse of proceedings in like
cases.
Nothing less than explicit language to the
contrary would justily any other interpreta
tion. We are, therefore, of opinion that the
court below was not authorized to enter the
judgment appealed from until all the issues
between the parties before the court should be
determined; and that when the court shall
have filed its findings upon the issues as to
which a new trial has been ordeied, it will
then be its duty to render a single judgment
upon the whole case, which shall include the
judgment so heretofore directed to be entered.
The Supreme Court then goes on to
comment on its opinion and the interpre
tation put upon it in the following words:
It may be added, in justice to the learned
Judge of the court below and to counsel for
plaintiff, that the language of our former judg
ment was perhaps not happily chosen or alto
gether clear in this respect, and was possibly,
standing alone, open to the construction in
sisted upon by plaintiff. But when regarded
in the general rule of procedure applicable in
like cases, as above indicated, such con
struction cannot, lor the reasons stated, be in
dulged.
Four of the Justices concur in this in
terpretation, but Justice Harrison and
Justice Garoutte atill believe the court
meant that the judgment should be en
tered at once.
The decision has postponed execution
on the $210,000 judgment for an indefinite
period. Judge Hebbard will probably de
cide the case on tbe fraudulent milling in
a few days now, and he will then enter
both judgments together. The case will
no before the Supreme Court again, and
in the meantime the judgment is waiting.
Rebearings and motions to continup, to
dismiss, to deny, will have to be argued
and decided, and the end of all is proble
matic. In tbe meantime the judgment
for $210,197 50, rendered by one court and
affirmed on appeal, will wait and wait.
Mr. B&ggett, wnile not satisfied with
the decision, is rushing things. He ap
peared before Chief Justice Beatty and
asked that the remittitur b<> sent down at
once. As the losing party, Baegett had a
right to ask that the usual thirty days be
waived, and an order was made directing
that the remittitur be issued forthwith.
The Hobart appeal now before the
Supreme Court is based on exactly the
earae point, and wishing to get that out of
the way. too, Baggett asked that a decision
be rendered in that coo. It had been stipu
lated that the argument on the one should
do for the other, and a decision on the one
would do for tbe other, but only the Hay
ward case had been decided. Judge
Beatty referred Mr. BagÃett to Judge Van
Fleet, who wrote the opinion of yesterday,
but Judge Van Fleet wanted more time to
consider the case.
Borne days ago the Supreme Court ren
dered a judgment of a similar dual char
acter as tbe one of yesterday. The action
was entitled Reed vs. Reed, suit for di
vorce and division of property. The de
cree of divorce waa sustained, but the
decision regarding the division of prop
erty was sent back for a retrial. The de
cree of divorce was entered at once, and
both husband and wife are at liberty to
marry again, but it would seem under tbe
latest decision that the judgment of di
vorce must wait till the settlement of
property. This case is cited by Fox and
others aa one which should have some
bearing on the peculiar circumstances of
the Hale & Norcross case.
THE NEW POSTOFFICE.
It Will Probably Be Constructed En*
tirely of California Products.
In all probability when the proposed
new San Francisco Postoffice is built it
will be almost exclusively of California
materials and products. The officers of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso-
ciation are rejoicing that they will have a
finger in this big pie, so to speak. In a re
cent communication from Supervising
Architect Aiken of the Treasury Depart
ment at Washington to the association
he states that so far as possible he will see
that California products and materials are
used in the construction of the projected
postoffice. He requested that the associa
tion send to him the names of California
manufacturers and producers who handle
and construct products such as could be
used in the big United States builcing.
This was just what the association's
members desired, and Manager Tacy is
now canvassing the rield with the Idea of
presenting a good list to select from. He
lias found that the California manufac
turers and producers can furnish every
thing necessary in the construction of the
postoffice. Stone, granite, marble, brick,
etc., can be obtained in unlimited quanti
ties and of superior quality witi.in the
State's boundaries. Terra-cotta, artificial
stone, iron and steel work, bronze, electri
cal and sanitary appliances and products
of art and skill are also to be obtained in
abundance here. The names of 400 or 500
membeisof the association who desire to
make bids on materials in their respective
lines will oe sent to the United States
architect, together with their catalogues
and prices. Samples of stone, marble,
granite and similar natural products will
also be forwarded for his inspection and
tests. The contract for the glass, which
will no doubi be a big one, will probably
go out of the State.
SUTRO DEFENDS HIS ROAD
Charges the Half-Fare Agitation
to the Southern Pacific
Company.
He Declares It an Attempt to Depre
ciate the Values of Out-
Bide Lands.
Mayor Sutro is grieved, not to say indig
nant, over what he declares to be an un
just attempt to have the fare on his road
from Central avenue to the Cliff House re
duced to 2}4 cents, and lays ail tne blame
for the agitation on the Southern Pacific
Company. Speaking of the matter he
said:
"This is a subject in which many of tte
improvement clubs have been misled by
designing persons. The transfers, which
are the rule now in San Francisco, make
car-rid in c as cheap in San Francisco, if
not cheaper, than in any other city I
know of. â¢
"A road operated on a 5-cent fare can
make but very little money, and so far as
the Sutro road is concerned the people in
the Richmond district can well afford to
contribute a trifle toward the revenue in
order to Day the expenses of operation.
"The fact of the matter ia, the 'Octopus'
is at the bottom of all tnis movement, in
order to depreciate outside lands, which,
without transfers, could hardly be reached
for a 2J4-cent fare for each road. In fact.
it would cost between."^ and 10 cents, and
this would, of course, Tamely tend to lower
values in property west of Central avenue.
"This movement is similar to the at
tempt of the railroad in Sacramento at the
last session of the Legislature to pass As
sembly bill 722. This measure passed both
houses, but was fortunately by my exer
tions vetoed by tbe Governor, on which
occasion I called him a noble Roman.
But the Qovernor has since fallen in with
the politicians, and I would hardly call
him a noble Roman no.v.
"The character of that bill was to estab
lish a fare of 5 rents for each three miles,
which would have counteracted the s cents
to tbe ocean which I have procured for the
people.
"I am astonished to see that many of
the clever men of which the improvement
clubs are composed should have allowed
the wool to be pulled over their eyee in
this manner; and when they understand
the true inwardness of the thing no im
provement ciub will advocate a VA cent
fare and the withdrawal of transfers."
WANTED IN PORTLAND.
Lee Kee Pong Desired aa a Witness
Against Chinese Certlflcate-
Forgers.
United States Marshal Barry Baldwin
arrested yesterday Lee Kee Pong, wanted
by the Portland authorities on sundry
charges, including an alleged illegal en
trance into the territory of Uncle Sam by
means of a forged certificate.
Thursday morning Marshal Baldwin re
ceived a telegram from P. o. Chappelle,
special agent at Portland, to the effect that
Lee Pong was wanted by tbe Federal au
thorities of that city, and that tbe wily
Chinese would probably bÂ« found at the
establishment of Quong Shing & Co., 15
Waverly place.
A decoy special-delivery letter, duly
stamped "Portland," was prepared and
sent lor delivery by the regular carriers.
Lee Pong took the letter readily, but
hardly had he signed the receipt when a
Deputy Marshal made him a prisoner.
Yesterday morning tbe much-wanted Chi
nese appeared before Commissioner Hea
cock and was committed to jail, subject to
the order of the Portland officials.
It seems that KeÂ°. Lee Pong is wanted
as a witness against a new, recently organ
ized gang ot Chinese certificate forgers.
Pong is said to be a member of the firm of
Lung & Co. and indirectly connected with
the certificate manipulators now operating
in that city. _
MÂ»y Build Toll Gates.
la the suit of Harvey S. Blood against R.T.
McCarty, the Supreme Court has decided that
local E-oards ot Supervisors may establish toll
gates to pay for building and keeping in repair
the county roads. McCarty was driving 3000
sheep along the Big Tree and Carson Valley
toll road in Calaveras County and Blood de
manded $30 toll. McCarty refused, and on
Â»uins for the $30 Blood was given judgment
for that amount. McCarty claimed that the
roads were public, and the Legislature could
not delegate the power to oostruct them to
local governments, but the Supreme Court
holds thai it can.
IT IS ALL TOO FUNNY,
J. B. R. Oslom's Letter to the
Coroner Threatening His
Suicide.
MISS L. BOWMAN LAUGHS.
A Gay Little Typewriter Who Cares
Little for an Unknown
Admirer.
Coroner W. J. Hawkins is in receipt of
one of his periodical letters announcing
the writer's intention to commit suicide
on account of the unrequited love of some
fafr maiden.
Three times in six weeks letters of this
kind have been received, and each time
the names of the ladies mentioned have
been fictitious.
All these letters have been written by
the same man, and the language in each
has been much the same.
In a letter received by mail yesterday
morning the name of Lillian Bowman was
mentioned, and her address, 105 Grove
street, was also given. In this instance
the young lady has materialized.
She ia a vivacious little typewriter in
embryo. She is studying her profession at
Heald's Business Jollege, and for reasons
best known to herself she does not live
with her mamma, nor will she room with
her sister of 317 Golden Gate avenue. In
stead she prefers to keep maiden quarters
at 105 Grove street.
She was very happy yesterday. An
artist was there sketching her pretty face
for publication and she anticipated the
visit of reporters ana artists.
"It is all ho much fun," she exclaimed,
jumping up on the back of her bed and
beating her heels on the board. "I don't
know who thia crank is who love 3me so,
but I will go and look at him at the
Morgue when they find him. I'm sure I
won't know him even then."
The idea of a man committing suicide
on account of love for her was great
amusement and her bright brown eyes
sparkled in merriment. It was all so
funny for this young woman that the im
pression was given that she had written
the letter to the Coroner herself.
Here is how that letter reads:
San Francisco, Cal., May 7, 1896.
W.J. HamHns, Coronerâ Dear Sir : When you
receive this 1 will be dead, for I am going to
jump In the bay. I have been in love with a
sweet, false face, and she would not have me.
I fell in love with beret Kuarny and Geary a
little over a week ago. Her name is Lilian
Bowman and she lives at 105 Grove street, in
this City. I have written to her to meet me,
and still she won't come, for she loves some one
else. Oh, my heart is breaking for her as I
write these words. lam 21 years old and my
folks live in Los Angelos. I won't give their
address, as I don't want them to know how
their boy died of a broken heart.
Oh, Lilhe, I love you! Why did you not
come and let me win your love? Oh, mv heart
is breaking for you, and it is you who are
sending me to a watery crave. Oh, my love,
good-by. 1 love you still, but you are false to
voursex. You are a designing woman, but I
love you. Oh, mother, good-by, and good-by,
sister. A girl by the name of Bowman killed
me, and she lives at 105 Grove street. Oh,
mamma, you might see this in the papers, but
forgive your son. Good-by, Lillie.
J. B. R. Oslom.
Miss Bowman claims that the has re
ceived a dozen or so of letters from her
unknown admirer within the past eight
days, but that she has destroyed them.
"In one of his letters," the young lady
said, "the fellow wanted me to become his
wife. Just think of it 1 His wife! Tnere
was a man I never saw and he wanted to
marry me. He must have been very
'stuck.' "
She giggled at the thought of it. "His
wife!" That was too funny, and she
laughed again, kicked her Heels against
the back of the bed and said she would no
longer submit to the pencil sketch the
artist was maKing.
"In another of his letters," Miss Bow
man said, "this man asked me to meet
him at the corner of Grove ar.d Polk
streets. He wanted me to have a hand
kerchief in my band that he might know
me No! I don't mean tnat. He
wanted the handkerchief in my hand to
know if I'd let him speak to me. I never
paid any attention to him."
The people at the Morgue have no idea
that the body of Oslom will ever be found.
Whether Miss Bowman and the writer of
the periodical tetters are partners in a
| hoax is what they care most to learn.
SENT OBSCENE LETTERS.
A. W. Bowman and Julias Lauer Ar
rested by Postal Inspector
Â£rwin.
A. W. Bowman and Julius Lauer were
arrested yesterday morning by Deputy
United States Marshal Dudley Harris on
a warrant sworn to by Postal Inspector
Erwin charging the prisoners with having
sent obscene matter throuch the mails.
Bowman is a card writer by profession
and until a few days ago had a stand on
Market street, near Fifth. Some months
ago he met Miss Rose Anderson, 935
Fourteenth street, and fell desperately in
love with her. His attentions! however,
were not appreciated by the young lady,
and she was not backward in announcing
the condition of her feelings. Bowman
resented this and got back at the object of
his unsolicited affections by writing her
obnoxious and obscene letters.
Lauer was afflicted with the vulgar let
ter-writing habit also, his special infirmity
lying in a seemingly uncontrollable desire
to make love to the young women em
ployed in a Kearny-street candy-store.
He continued this thing for nearly" a year,
and then the police were requested to
arrest the offender. For a time Lauer let
up in his letter- writing, but a few| days
ago began sending the most vile letters to
the young women. His arrest, as noted
above, followed.
Lauer is originally from Modoc County,
where his parents now reside. It is said
that he got into a similar trouble there.
The opinion of the postal authorities is
that Bowman and Lauer are of unsound
mind. Lauer admits that he was at one
time an inmate of an insane asylum.
Fool-Sellors Arrested.
Two men giving the names of James Brown
and James Wilson were arrested by Officer C.
M. Barnes for violating the pool-selling ordi
nance yesterday afternoon. Their place of
business is on Glasgow street. They were re
leased on bonds.
The Kaby Waif.
The baby found on the doorsteps of .v 3
Minna street, at midnight Thursday, waa sent
to St. Joseph's Home yesterday. The child
was wrapped in, a blanket, and there were no
marks by which he could b<Â» identified.

Family of Hon. William R. Smith Made
Well by Paine's Celery Compound.
"To him who In the love ot >~aturÂ«

She speaks a various language."
No one has a deeper insight into nature's
ways than the superintendent of the ex-
tensive botanic gardens of the United
States at Washington.
No one knows so well as he what precious
opportunities come with the spring.
Bupt. Smith, like most scientific persons,
firmly believes that every one would be
benefited by taking a spring remedy while
the blood is readiest to be purified and in-
vigorated.
Paine's celery compound is the only
genuine spring remedy worthy of that
name, in the opinion of Supt. Smith. He
writes:

That Paine's celery compound does cure
positively and permanently all diseases
arising from impure b!ood or decline in the
vigor of the nerves is cheerfully attested
by thousands of earnest men and women.
Weakness, depression, irritability, pain
and lancuor tell that the nervous "matter
in the brain, nerves and spinal cord is not

To quickly furnish a fresh and abundant
supply of nutriment for every tissue of the

The result of his life work was Paine's

WOMAN'S POWER BEHIND THE THRONE.
Ten Splendid Essays Read at Yesterday's
Session of the Pacific Coast
Woman's Congress.
"THE CALL" IS PRAISED.
Miss Severance Applauds the
Stand of the Great
Daily.
"AUNT SUSAN'S" FIRST LOVE.
Professor Griggs' Strong Paper on
" The Modern Change in Ideals
of Womanhood."
Pale golden fleurs de lis, deep orange
poppies, yellow marguerites with doth of
gold and Marechal Niel roses gave to the
stage in Native Sous' Hall a warm, cheer
ful coloring during yesterday's sitting of
the Woman's Congress of the Pacific Coast.
The president stated that she had re
ceived a very large number of letters from
different parts or the State commending
the very full accounts of the sessions of
the congress given by the City pavers and
particularly by The Cam., which, she said,
it should not be forgotten bad been the
first to come out for the cause â to lead off
and be followed by the others.
The first paper of the da', "America's
Great- Queens,"' by Miss Ilarryett R.
Strong, was read by Miss Dorothea Koth.
The following extract will give a fair idea
of this interesting essay :
When we use the word "greatness" as applied to !
a sovereign what do we ir.e.in? t>o we menu a
might* monarch or an >r 'â¢â¢ character? In loosing
down the short roll of history* woman rulers is
there one worthy of that epithet which ha; been
applied to Frederics aixi Peter. Alfred xind Alex- I
ander? If so. upon w:int is thai title ti.-.st-il? lias
a queen been great us tighter? Has she left a â 
glorious record of bat. es and a tax-groaning peo- j
pie behind her? li no;, and sue still deserves
honor, : hen there tuns: be tome other way of win- !
ning fame than through \va\
bo careiully has the roÂ»a privilege been guarded
thai during- the whole period of 4000 years, his
toric and mythological, when 640 kings reigne.l
on the uptimes River alone, only about thirty
times in round numovrs Has a woman held regal
or imperial power by vi.\ue of her own rich: as
queen or empress regnant. There have been
myriads of queens-mother or queens-resent,
queens-consort ana queens-dowager, but seldom
have they had allowance paid to them as supreme.
At lt-a*t nine of these thirty ics.ince* are
mythological or narrowed down ".o a me re rlsnt,
and of the twenty-one remaining, one, Galla

as regent than as regnant; one, the Empress .
Maud, hud little chance to rule, and one, the little '
Wilbelmina of Holland, has nor yet begun her

queers and empresses whose lives we may
examine.
Of these eighteen royal women six represent best

navian discoveries and settlements on the west of
oret-nlanJ.
The second, Isabella of Castile (1474), succeeded
to her brother's kingdom in preference to his
daughter: her claim to America comes through
the discoveries of Columbus, undertaken under
the Spanish crown.
Elizabeth of England, 1533, who inherited her
throne throueh will and act of Parliament, ranks
as third of America's great Queens because of h?r
Waiter Kaleich's explorations on the Eastern
coast, even now called Virginia, and of Sir Francis ;
Drake's discovery of this" our own San Francisco
Bay.
The fourth in point of time we cannot claim m
our own. but she ranks with the world's great
Queens and there deserves a word of men-
Maria Theresa of Austria, 1717, inherited
from her father, but was obliged to defend her
heritage.
The fifth, Catherine the Great of Russia. 1729,
usurper, can with truth be reckoned as America's
fourth great female sovereign, by virtue of Alaska '
when it oelonged to Russia.
Victoria, the last of ', the list and our fifth and :
latest Queen, relcns now over the largest part of
.North America, and has had the longest and most
peaceful reign In all history.
Of Isabella of Castile it may be said that her
praise has been extravagantly sounded throughout â¢
he centuries, and only of late has prejudice
striven to create a reaction. Her public acts m*y :
sometimes justly have deserved censure â her per- ;
sonality never, -he was -verything as to sweet- ;
i ess. gentleness, wisdom, magnanimity, that j
could be desired, a careiui mother and affectionate '
lie. and these excellent personal qualities were
combined with those mental traits of sagacity and ;
farsightedness that make the sovereign great.
Catherine of Russia, the only woman called j
"The Great." possessed great genius and greater
faults. Historians place her ait only second to !
Peter in her achievements toward Russia's devel
opment. Good she certainly was not. but her ad
ministrative ability showed her mental traits to be
transcendent. Her ambitions were also im
mense, and she undertook vast schemes -merely
for show-*' the historians tell vs â of improving her
country, reforming education, drawing up the 'â 
plans fox a Hassan dictionary, founding an acad- ,
emy, etc She, of all the others fought and con- !
quered, but when she set about to make her name i
renowned it was through the arts of peace and not
of war that she attempted it.
Victoria is no absolute monarch as Catherine,
nor despotic as Elizabeth; she is what U called a
constitutional sovereign: she reigns, while her !
Parliament and Ministers govern. Victoria pos- j
â esses the royal prerogative, but she contents her
â elf with merely perfunctory duties of making doc- !
amenta legal by affixing the royal signature to ;
every paper placed before her. This action re- i
sembles a lion with its teeth drawn, for royalt> '
â Â«.: bout power ceases to be dangerous. That "such !
a government is for the welfare of the nation the
prosperity and greatness of Victoria's realm a;- 'â 
tests.
Now that we have quickly glanced at the his
lories of these royal women, written down in men's
annals and compared with the kings of their re- i
spective times. *, hat do we discover? Are their !
kingdoms the laughing stock of the nations? Do j
their realms suffer confusion and anarchy under
the weak rule of woman? We have hardly found ;
it so? Have they been carried away by their
womanly emotions, or Influenced by unworthy
and unscrupulous favorites?
The one reason why their good deeds are often
not given credit due is Oecause somehow or other I
their excellent men advisers should also share the
praise. These same advisers, however, were
chosen by the Queens themselves. I>o we and
weakness of intellect? No. they were magnifi- '
cently educated, and often their chief desire nai
to promote learning throughout their territories.
\s ere they bloodthirsty and crnel? Not even the
worst of the Queens regnant. Blood was shed and
wars carried on. bat supreme power seemed to '
steady them and fill the m with a sense of reaponsi
bOlty for their subjects' lives. Not one ranks as' a '
monster with Ivan the Terrible, nor in worthless- ;
cess at the side of John of England. Thev-all dos- :

REV. ANNA SHAW, Pacific Coast Council,
San Francisco.
Please convey kindest greetings and best wishes to Pacific
Coa*t Council i LADY ABERDEEN.
i Massachusetts called the Great Sachem,
i and among the Iroquois there was a
woman ruler at one time. I have observed
that it was not an uncommon thing for tne
woman of early times to holu high places
among the aboriginal tribes of America,"
"The Queen Dowager," was the subject
of the second paper of the morning, and
was written by Mrs. Sturtevant-Peetof San
Jose, who, during her reading, expressed
the following thoughts:
Identical with individual and material char
acter governments have been derived and become
-at factors in solving the problems of civiliza
tion. In reviewing the laws instituted tor regulat
ting soi-'al. moral and civil relations it is interest
ing to note the mold of individual characters, re
gardless of sex, in formulating and enforcing pro
visions for the control and administration of public
affairs.
'1 he least conspicuous among royal women,
though by no means the least potent, have been
the mothers of icings and rulers, "queen dowa
reis. ' .Such mothers have in most instances man
ifested more than ordinary interest In the wel
fare of offspring and nation: they have exerted an
Influence, oft times determining their future destiny.
1 lie peculiar relation of dowager mothers to the
throne, their Interest and great inflence in public
affairs is the burden of my theme.
The benign influence of a mother cap scarcely be
estimated in the humbler positions of life: and to
: measure it when intimately associated with the
: throne to which is delegated such a decree of
supreme power is beyond the strength of mind to
i comprehend. Almost every nation In feu rope at
one time or another has been placed in the position
of being ruled by a woman.
Helena, the h-mpress mother of Constamine, was
one of the many uobleaua influential characters of
the period. She was placed at the head of the
exchequer and honor.d with a seal in all of the na-
I tional councils. she was granted the special privi
lege of suggesting new and untried methods, with
: the authority to force tue same. The city of
I london was enlarged and fortified incompliance
with her request. Other cities were founded In her
! name. She was with her son when he presided at
the council of Nice. A. D. 3-J5. In al affairs and
, interests of state Helena aided the Kmperor with
â¢ her experience and temp-red his acts with her
wisdom.
Before passing to the suggestions and inferences
to be gathered irom our subject it wi.i be Interest
ing to make reference to one who has been promi
nent in the East tor forty years, one of the world's
greatest rulers, the Queen Dowager of China.
While she has had all to do witn the education of
the toy I'-uiperor. she has "governed as well as
reigned." A second writer says of her, that though
possessed of a kind heart, she is proud, strong and
ambitious as Queen Semiramis. In the days of a
grrat famine in the emu. re, she made a sacrifice
of tbe meat upon her own table, that she muht
RUi.-uiue:.t the relief fund provided be the state, a
! good example that might be followed by our
i officials in time of financial distress. Her patriot
| Ism ii.in stood many such a test. Upon o-casion
I of i-ejebrating her sixtieth birthday anniversary
j during the recent Japanese invasion, which was
| to cost VU.000.000 ounce* of silver, she abandoned
, the programme, contenting herself with a private
celebration, and paid the money into the war chest
for the defense of her country. "
The most Impressive fact suggested by onr sub
ject is the value of a cultured mother conscious of
her wisdom and responsibility. Mothers educated
and interested in the affairs of state will give
strength and breadth of character to the future
generations. in which alone rest the greatness and
perpetuity of a Government. The greatest trees of
the forest never grow upon weak and shallow
soil: he purest streams of water never flow from
turbid founts. Greatness never comes by chance.
i Then- was a Helena before a Constantine, aa Isa
; bella before the birth of ttiiu Republic, statesmen
before a Clay, Calhoun and a Webster. !*o woman's
sphere mini be expanded, so motherhood must be
endowed with equal sovereign rights an 1 crowned
with the honor of citizenship before the birth of
perfect freedomâ before the drawing near of a bet
i ter, brighter era iv the realm of government.
"I am not intimately acquainted with
our dowager queens," remarked Miss
Severance. "But the first dowager queen I
erected a great mausoleum for her kind
Mansolns. The present Queen of Spain
i? a dowager queen, and she is rearing the
little child that shall be the future ruler.
There have been all kinds of dowager
queens, good and bad, just as there are
among us common people."
Mrs. E. G. Greene of Santa Cruz, follow
ing with a few remarks on Mrs. Peet's pa
per, eulogized the Dowager Queens as the
mothers of rulers, the mothers to whom all
honor should be accorded.
Miss A. M. Fulton, a teacher m Miss
West young ladies' seminary, read a very
scholarly paper on "The Power Behind the
Throne. 1 ' Her popularity among her !
present students and those formerly mem
bers of the seminary was attested "by the
presence of a large number of these vbnnÂ«Â»
ladies, who permitted no good point to
escape their approving applause, and as a
result the whole audience repeatedly united
with them in commending the sentiments
expressed in the paper. In part her re
marks were as follows:
If we consider the different phases of that power
we shall tina that hey are mainly two, viz. : her
power to mold and her power to guide. The mold
ing power is embraced in the two offices, that of
mother and that of teacher: and theguidiajt do war
in that of sis:Â«. lover or wife.
he first of these carries with It an immense re
spoustbUUy, no matter by whom It is discbarred.
There is no more high and noble dnty in life- no
more Important taste that can be undertaken than
the training and development of the voting ana
growing life. .Nature nerself has clearly indicated
whose du;v this shall be; the finKer of Providence
points to the woman and says: -Behold, her have
1 selected for this holy function. She, and she
alone, is capable of the condition of motherhood ;
and to her naturally belongs toe care of the vounc
life which she has brought into the world."
The choice of the Creator In this respect Is ex- i
tremely significant In the division of labor In the
world between man and woman ; It has left man â 
free to act, to str.ve and to mix with the outer
world. It basiled her down to wba: I consider
the most important duty that can be Riven to man
or woman in this life. It has not only made this
duty hers, bat has given her the qualities that ena- ;
ble her to discharge tbe duty succes.ifallv. wo
man. developed woman, has patience, endless pa- !
tience, great power of ending annoyance and sor- 'â 
row, and a clear. y defined sense "of right and !
wrong. >o equipped Â»he li abie to shape tbe life
of the growing boy or girl, to train, to prune, to :
correct. No one so well as the mother can do this,
and sadly untrained and unformed Is often tbe i
young child who comes up to the teacher from the
hand of the nurse or the care of the servant. Lone I
years of patient effort on the part of Hie latter
do cot suffice sometimes to undo the mischief
that has been done.
This duty then of the training and development i
of the young and growing being devolves upon the
mother from thÂ» moment of its birth, and should
be continued, with the help of the teacher, who
should also be a woman, up to the time of the ma- !
turlty of the individual. Almost everything that <
the child is to become in future years depends 'â 
upon the Influence of these two irnldeÂ». '
The power behind tbe throne in this case rules !
the throne throughout life. We have the testl :
mony of many good men to she fact that the prin
ciples instilled then are never forgotten. Hear
Kuskin as he testifies on this point â¢
"I have yet with deeper gratitude to chronicle
what I owed to my mother for the resolutely con
sUtent lessons which so exercised me in the Scrip
ture. An i truly, though I have picked on the '
element* of a little further knowledge in mat
matics, meteorology and the like in after life, and

forth to do battle, will she not be able from her
point of vantage outside the field to observe how
the action progresses, and by her wise counsel to
help wlu the victory?
So far I have spoken only of women behind the
throne as a power for good. Le us see now what
she can do as a power for evil. Suppose we take
the historical and literary example of the wife of
â² udreadel Sana Here we have the case of a
â¢a iiiuun who, through the charm of her personal at
tractions, really held the fate Of her husband In her
handsâ he a man of the higbeut natural abilities,
but lacking in moral str ngth.
Yet such was his love for her that had she been
able to inspire him with a high and noble ambition
to excel in his art, had it been her aim to develop
to the full all his powers and faculties, he might,
as Browning puts it, have given Hapbael himself
enough to do to excel him. As It is, we Qnd him
caring for nothing but to make a little money with
which to buy her a lace ruffle, or help her to enter
tain her friend'â ambition and character alike
gone, all the high hopes of his youth dashed to the
ground and his splendid abilities wasted.
1 must cloie these remarks by emphasizing and
reiterating what I have already hinted at-that If
woman shall be able adequately to meet the needs
of the times and the demands which her new
position makes upon her, she must try to carry on
as best she can a process of self-development; her
intellectual range should be widened, her sym
pathies deepened and strengthened, her moral and
spiritual nature so fully deve'.oped and so largely
in the ascendant that they not only dominate her
own life, but also leave their lasting impress upon
the lives of every one with whom she comes in
contact. And blessed is tbe people when such a
woman holds the power behind the throne.
Mr. Bennett offered some remarks upon
the paper. He looked to socialism to
make woman a greater power behind the
throne.
The last paper of the morning was by
Mrs. Ada Van Pelt, the popular and re
spected lady president of the Woman's
Press Association and vice-president of
the congress. Her theme was "The
Mothers of (ireat Men." In one portion
of her brilliant essay Mrs. Van Pelt said :
The astute and speculative Greek recognized the
mother's influence in developing character, and in
altecttug social and iiatlt.nal life, for oue of their
old proverbs Is: -Mighty is the influence of moth
erhood."
In the study of lives of great men we find that
the mother's influence was the potent factor which
molded the character of these intellectual giants
who became worid movers.
Ureat men have had superior mothers. This
statement is verified by the fact that almost every
man whose name stands high on the historic page
us statesman 'or sage, philosopher or poet, warrior
or reformer, have had mothers of marked ability.
According to the law of heredity, parents live In
the lives of their children. Kspecially is this the
cnae with the mother, who gives to her offspring
not only the peculiarities of her physical but of her
intellectual and moral nature.
In all ages God has honored good mothers. He
could have sent an angel to Bethlehem, bearing in
Its arms the intact Savior, but for all time mother
hood was to be consecrated.
Elizabeth was in her declining years when her
life was biessed by a son. .*he represented the old
era about to pass away, a new era was now about
to be ushered In. for the time had come wllen the
son of Ciod was to appear veiled in human flesh.
So a virgin, type of fhe new dispensation, was
chosen to be the medium through which tbe ad
vent was to be made. While feeling that she waa
not worthy of such honor, yet Man- accepted the
position o: becoming tbe mother of the Messiah
with a heroism as gentle aa it was great, and she
has shown us vow div.ne it is to love, how divine
it is to bo maternally tender, how divine it is to be
womanly.

Augustine. The world owes muca to the faithful
mother of Su Augustine, for by her devotion her
son became the father of theology.
As a fit companion to Monica is Ajithusa, the
motfcerof Cbrysov.om. Left a widow at 20, she
refused all offers of marriage, that she rnUbt de
vote her life to the rearing of h> r son. So well did
she store bit mind with spiritual truths that his
teacher, the great philosopher, Libumius could
not lead him into heathenism.
AftÂ«r lunch an informal meeting, pre
sided over by Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw
and Mrs. Cooper, was held in the parlors
of the Ho. el Berkshire. There was a large
attendance.
Mrs. Ida Harper, chairman of the press
committee, reported that ail friends of the
woman suffrage movement were more
than delighted at the fearfess and brave
stand taken by The Call, which had
sounded the keynote of the campaign.
The other papers, she conceived, would
soon have to follow in The Calls foot
steps. The Monitor had offered the use of
its columns for articles on the movement,
and several other papers seemed more or
less friendly in tone.
Reports from interior suffrage clubs
stated that thousands of copies of last
Sunday's edition of ThÂ« Call had been
scattered broadcast throughout the State.
There were reported to be forty-6ve active
woman suffrage clubs in various parts of
the State, all in flourishing condition.
The question of ways and means was
referred to a committee consis'ine of Mes
dames Mctomas, Andrews and Hay, with
instructions to prepare subscription-cards
for circa lation among friends of the cause.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
Woman Viewed In History, In the
Home and In Time of War.
Tbe informal Â«eÂ«sion over, the officers
and members returned to the hall.
"The Heroines of History" gave Mrs.
Henry Krebs Jr. her theme at the opening
of the afternoon session. She said :
The women of the Scriptures have filled many
places of honor, trust and authority.
First among women of the old Testament stands
Deborah, the^prophetess. When thisfremarkable
woman was raised up to be their judge and de
liverer the Israelites were in a miserable, forlorn
and degraded condition, being under the subjec
tion and oppression of Jabin. Kingof the Cnnaan
ites. Deborah commissioned Barak to take 10,000
men and to against aisera and bis hosts.
Alarmed at the Idea of encountering so great an
army with so small a force, Barak refused to go
unless she accompanied him. >he repllrd to him
that she had offered him the command and with
It the honor: that she would go with him. but the
glory of the victory should be given to a woman.
Deborah so inspired her followers by fiery ap
peal and battle cry mat they rushed upon the
enemy and, with God on their side, the immense
army of Cnnaanitea was discomfited and over
thrown.
For wisdom, patriotism and valor '"she was un
surpassed by any ruler of Israel from Moses to
l>avld, a period of 400 years."
Her higher qualities as prophetess and priestess
are Indicated in "her glorious song of triumph
which for poetry, sublimity and historic Interest
has seldom been exceeded."
She arrogated to herself no other title than that
of "mother." showing that it was love for her
country and people that stirred her whole spirit to
assume the responsibilities of government when
the wisdom and saÂ«> city of man proved uneo.ua!
to the task.
The Scriptural commentators have remarked
"that Deborah alone of all tbe rulers of Israel went
ucreproved by the prophets and Inspired
historians." "The land bnder her rule had rest
for forty years," and the "hand of the children of
Israel prospered."
Uow brave tbe spirit that took Judith to the
camp of Holoferaes In performance of an act that
should save the besleeed city of Bethnlia.
What fidelity to kindred and friends was dis
played by Esther, the beantilul Jewisu maiden
who when raised to the proud position of the
Queen of Persia forgot not her people, and at the
risk of life itself saved them from annihilation.
We have in this new land many women whose
heroic acts and patriotic deeds rendertbeni worthy
of our highest reverence and administration. I
Of those distinguished for heroism and fortitude
In philanthropy we name as entitled to high re
nown such illustrious women as Dorothea L. nix
Klizabetii Fry. Mrs. Jndson, Margeret Fuller, Mary
Wollstonecraft, Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Mary a'
Livermor-, Dr. (.{race Klmbali and Susan B. An
thony, our champion and our chief, who has the
rare distinction of having given her life and labor
unremittingly for fifty years to the uplifting of
her sex.
Through thÂ° dark night of discouragements, dis
appointments, scorn and derision, with dauntless
courage, strong in her conviction of right, this
grand woman has unceasingly toiled.
But the dawn has come and the full noontide
glory is not far distant when her labors shall have
their full fruition.
And a* she is the noblest of living matrons, so
may she yet wear the civic crown of American
citizenship in the land which shall have received
Its '-new birth of freedom."
Mr*. J. F. Swift opened the discussion
by referring to the many noble women of
all times whose names are not chronicled
on the pages of human history.
Mrs. Cooper referred to the biblical
character so well jrnown as the unknown
widow who contributed her mite to the
treasury, and she characterized her as one
of the unknown heroines of history.
At this juncture a lady's cnair slipped
from beneath her and she slid some dis
tance on the waxed floor, knocking down
other chairs in her wild career, to every
body's consternation.
"bince this congress opened," observed
Miss Shaw, "at least fifty women have
fallen, frontways, sideways and every way.
and yet not one of them has let out a
scream. It looks as though women were
learmne self-control."
"When the Native Daughters have a
hall," commented Mis. Swift, "we'll have
chain that women can sit on without dan
ger to life and limb."
Mrs. George T. Gaden read a charming
paper on the potent influence of woman in
the home. Her brilliant essay had for its
title, "The Slave as tiuler," but the woman
whom she painted seemed far from being
a servant. She traced the power of a good
woman on husband, brothers and sons,
showine how a woman of prudence and
fortitude could ruie her home as though
Â»he were a veritable queen. The essay was
frequently interrupted by applause.
Napthaiy Herz lmber, of whom it has
been said he ate onions and breathed de
fiance at the rabbis, was the first one to be
recognized by tbe ccair when the discus
sion was opened. He went into biblical
and medieval history with a rush, and
was somewhere in an" anecdote of Alfred
the Great w&en, the time-limit for such
speeches having expired and the warning
little bell having sounded several times
without his notice, the audience gracefully
applauded him to his original position.
Mrs. Orr offered a few pertinent remarks
on the paper, and then a lady far back in
the audience arose and spoke 6f women in
tne earliest patriarchal age, whom she
said were often the judges.
A brief bat very interesting paper on
'Â« oman in War Times" was read by
Mrs. E. 0. Smith and called forth a
lengthy discussion.
â¢â¢ "? bere is a woman ." began Miss Yates,
who more than any other has done much
for the United States. Had it not been
for Anna Ellen Carroll the United States
muht not still have been the United
states of to-day. It was her intimate
knowledge of the South that, given to the
an lpÂ°rities, made many of the victories
of Grant possible. And yet that woman
died in poverty and unrecognized for her
patriotic acts. Misa Anthony and I visited
her in Wa?hineton, where she was being
cared for by the charity of friends. We
tried in vain to get a pension for her.
Though thousands upon thousands of
men have been pensioned she could not be
rewarded.
"And we have poured out millions
granting pensions to men, many of whom

Mrs. Andrews of Los Aneeles said she
was a member of an association in that
city composed of Confederate and TJnioo
veterans and their women sympathizers.
she >-aid the organization once gave a
banquet and asked six of tbe lady mem
bers to prepare trie food and lay the tables.
Their work over, the ladies were expected
to leave; but they stayed, and since then
the precedent has been followed, women
having a share in ali the convivial meet
ings of the association.
Mrs. McCauiay said: "I want to men
tion the neroes of our own State, the
pioneer fighters of California. They not
only cleared the way for the immigrants;
tney located many of the valuable mines,
but because they were United States sol
diers they were not permitted to claim
them."
Miss Anna Shaw then advanced to the
front of the platform, and, greeted by the
applause her presence seems always to
call forth, said: "
"Who can say that the women did not
snffer S3 much in war times as the men?
The agony of silent, anxious waiting is as
severe an ordeal as the danger of battle.
The question with us to-day^ however, is
01173 May 7, 1896.
Charles M. Shortridge, Editor The Call:
Dear Sir--Horace Greeley once wrote: "If any person ever
supposed that any earthly consideration could induce me to write
and publish what people desire to read rather than what they ought
to know he has wholly mistaken the purpose for which the Tribune
is published, and he should stop his subscription at once."
When The Call took its position on the side of equal suffrage
I wondered whether the old days of journalism had come again, when
a great modern newspaper dare to have and publish opinions not
dictated by some convention of political highbinders or by the
money-drawer in the business office. Whether this is to be real
ized or not, the attitude of The Call kindles hope, while it re
vives memories of the old Tribune. The incident has also its
amusing features. The headlong haste all the other papers made to
vault over one another to "get in" on the side of The Call in
twenty-four hours after was a sight to behold. I am sure the ex
perience of The Call will demonstrate over again that right,
justice And expediency have not parted company. Yours truly,
JAMES S. REYNOLDS.
not the question of war; it is of peace.
And I wish that the women of this con
gress would by a set of resolutions put
themselves on record as favoring arbitra
tion.
"Though I have been asked many times
to associate myself with societies com
memorating war victories I have refused
to affiliate with them, as I am strongly
opposed to perpetuating fearful struggles
between man and man. i see a much
more commendable organization exist
right here in this State. I mean the Na
tive Sons of the Golden West. Such an
association binds together the founders of
the State. And have you Native Daugh
ters? All the better, but it should be all
one organizationâ Native Sons and
Daughters of Californiaâ for I never did
believe in setting up such distinctions of
sex.'
Then Miss Shaw went on to relate an in
cident in her childhood ; how she had held
the plow and ridden the horse in the corn
fiela during war times, when her father
and brothers were in the army.
Touching upon the heroine', Miss Anna
Ivlla Carroll, mentioned by Miss Gates,
she said that Miss Carroll would not have
died in poverty had there been any wo
men in Congress when her pension was
asked for.
Some one had written Miss Shaw com
plimenting herself, Miss Anthony and
Miss \ates for showing the good sense to
remove their hats in public indoor as
semblages, and hinting stron/ly that If
all women who want the ballot would fol
low Â«dit it would be a telling point gained
in the good graces of man, anu would ma
tei%lly aid their cause at the election
next November. Miss Shaw advised her
auditors not to let a high hat stand be
tween them and freedom in the coming
election.
Jost before adjournment the following
resolution was adopted:
Rao'.ved, That we in congrress assembled
place ourselves on record aa favoring the set
tlement of all differences and difficulties.
State and National, by arbitration.
The following letter was also read amid
much applause:

cordial greetings, our congratulations upon
the past success of your noble organization,
our rcgreu that more of our members cannot
share the benefits of your unequaled pro
grammes, our most sincere sympathy with
your work and cordial good wishes for its
success.
We rejoice In your magnificent effort to dis
cover the right foundations and to rear there
on enduring structures of government for the
individual, the home and the Nation, all of
which ought to profit by your deliberations.
Four facts with relation to government are
true: Firstâ ln time past government* have
rarely aroused themselves to restrain evils, to
restore rights, to correct wrongs, until forced
to do so by the demand of the people. Secondâ
The people rarely make an effective demand
until to the majorities the need of reform is
apparent. Thirdâ The need of reform is rarely
apparent to majorities until after the investi
gation of fact* and the dissemination of
knowledge on the part of a few.
Fourthâ few rarely make such investiga
tion until the evils haTe grown to the propor
tions of great wrongs.
The Woman's Congress Association of the
Pacific Coast seems to be disproving the fourtn
statement and to have aroused itself for the in
vestigation of trnth and the dissemination of
knowledge in time to prevent the destructive
growth of much that is evil and to strengthen
much that is eood.
To this effort the National Council of Women
of the United Slates â committed as it is to the
"highest good of the family and the State, to
the overthrow of all forms of ignorance and
injustice, and to the application of the golden
rule to society, custom and law"â desires to
tender its active sympathy and cordial co
operation. -
Begging to add thereto my own personal
regret at my Inability to share the pleasures
and profits of thÂ« occasion. I am, sincerely
yours. Mast Low Dickussos.

United States.
EVENING SESSION.
Professor Edward H. Cr\ggs of Stan
ford University Makes a Very
B -in lant Address.
As regards a great audience the at
tendance at last evening's session of tbe
Woman's Congress was second only to the
packed and uncomfortably overcrowded
hall of Wednesday night, "when Miss An
thony and Mis? Shaw and their co-work
ers had returned triumphant from the Re
publican convention at the State Capital :
but as far as intense, prolonged applause
for any one speakers effort is considered,
last night's meeting was tne most notable
of tbe whole successful concress. The
name of Professor Griggs of Stanford Uni
versity several times referred to in paper*
read before the congress, is said to be sufb'

women. It certainly seemed last night
that the magnetism of his words produced
a wonderful effect upon his hearers.
A pale, intellectual, almost ethereal
looking young man still in his twenties,
he delivered a surprisingly forcible and
' charming extemporaneous speech on be
half of womanhood, an effort that even
Miss Shaw toofc occasion to declare was
, tne embodiment and perfect expression of
her own highest ideals on the subject.
When the wild applause following Pro
! fessor Griggs' introduction had subsided
j he began his address, during which and
I amid repeated applause he said:
Ideals change with all change in actual life. The
Ideal is the horizon, which is determined by the
point where we stand. At the same time the'ideal
i (8 ihe best standard for measuring the actual life.
The key to a man or an epoch is the ideal wor
shiped. What one is to-day is a changing shadow
on the sundial of time, while the ideal is the white
light which casts the shadow.
It is especially important to recognize this In
studying t c changes of ideals of womanhood. I
These changes tell us better almost than anything I
else the true progress of tbe higher human life.
It is extremely difficult to state the fundamental i
. differences between men and women. Sex differ
i entiation Is only one example of^he great principle !
, of division of labor â its aim Is economy and adup- i
| tatlon. In primitive conditions of life the func
tions of women are industrial and reproductive.
while those of men are protective and milltury.
In very early limes a greater equality between '
men and women prevailed than at intermediate :
stages of progress. This is in harmony with '
the general law of evolution. Primitive life
is non-moral, and progress means greater possibil
ity for advance or degeneration.
With the growth of early societies inequality in- 'â 
creasea in all political and social conditions. '
I State and class tyrannies arose out of loose family j
j and tribal conditions, the nii.i ary functions pre
! dominated over tbe industrial and hence came the '
. enslavement of women. The painful story of slow I
i emancipation is written in great suffering and is ;
j still going on. The freedom of women has fiim
step by step with the emancipation of indubtrial :
functions from the dominance of military ones.
The type of womanhood fostered by such con
ditionsof life was industrial aud domestic. Marriage
was developed by natural selection for tbe better j
protection of ofliprlng, and the woman who had no
opportunity to perpetuate herself was the one wil- j
ling to lose her personality absolutely In the famil v
life.
Yet the close association of two human beings !
reacts upon the development of each, and marriage i
came to be a relation founded to some extent on i
permanent qualities of character We have a '
good illustration of the struggle of the two prin- 'â¢
ciples in the best period of Greek civilization
i where the higher class of courtesans received a '
respect incomprehensible to us, because they- alone ;
were suflicieutly educated to be intellectual com
panions to cultivated man, while tbe Greek wives j
and mothers were kept in ignorance and seclusion. ;
Christianity brought a reverence for womanhood ;
which the ancient world bad never known, ihe
worship of the Virifln placed womanhood in a new
light. Yet the gain was not unmixed witn cvii,
; for the type of woman reverenced was no: the
j human wife and mother. The medieval ideal was '
ascetic and negative. It worshiped the purity of
innocence and not the parity of virtue. It viewed ;
I marriage as a concession to the weakness of man- '
j kind; looked upon those women as noblest who
refused a 1 human ties and chose a life of isolation
from the world.
This ideal was opposed to natural selection ana
had inevitably to disappear The medieval woman
who perpetuated herself in offspring was the one â 
wi.llnÂ« to sinK herself In the life of the famJv. :
Family life might be an adjunct in the lives of
men, but it had to fill the whole of the lives of
married women.
The dawn of modem ideals of womanhood oc
curs In the Renaissance as a part of that wonder- :
ful expansion of life. We and at times a new con- '
cep:ion of marriage and a recognition of higher ;
possibilities in the personal relations. But the '
women who realized this were few in number*,
i^ince that time the growth has been remarkable, '
increasing with immense rapidity in our own time, j
Tbe home is still far from ideal, but marr'.ag^ :
has come to be more and more a spiritual relation i
based on the more permanent qualities of cliarac- ,
ler. This means a change in the basis of natural
selection in its application to women and marri
age. Formerly the woman wbo was able to per
petuate herself was the on?- willing to lose her in
dependent :ife in the family relations. To-day, |
more and more. Intelligent men seek as their ni%-es
MM of independent and free development wbo |
are unwilling to sacrifice their separate life and j
activities entirely to the domestic rel nons. Hence i
educated, intelligent women have mor aud tuore
:be selective value placed upon i u -.-v. th>- strug- !
gle for existence. Marriage cea^e> - merely a i
reproductive and industrial insti.ii.ioii and be
comes spiritual and human.
Tbe failure to see this mars much of the current '
thought on human problems, yet the change in i
the selective principles here is the same as that !
which is seen everywhere. Brute strength was i
once dominant in the struggle for existence; tow -.
it has given place to intellectual and moral i
qualities. When a higher adaptation appears it '
has a greater selective value than those below v |
in the scale. When the family comes to Influence '

To the Editor of The Call:
It was with feelings of the deepest gratitude and apprecia
tion that I read of the advance position taken by The Call re
garding woman suffrage. The women of California will "rise up
and call you blessed " for your brave efforts in their behalf ;
and when the victory is won next November they will not be
unmindful of the hand that extended the timely aid, of the pilot
that led the way into harbor. They will call mass-meetings in
every city, town and hamlet in the State, at which they will call
to mind the valuable assistance given them by the San Fran
cisco Call in their struggle for independence. The first exer
cise of their newly acquired political privileges will be to call
for the appropriation of a sufficient fund for the erection of a
grand monument in Golden Gate Park, which shall tower high
above all others, and prove a fitting testimonial from thousands
of grateful women of their high esteem and profound admira
tion for the San Francisco Call and its noble representatives.
Should there arise any objection to such use of the public
funds a draft can be made upon the accumulated taxes paid by
women during the pa3 t two hundred years, in the disbursement
of which they had no voice or vote, and with such a vast sum at
their disposal they can erect a monument that will reach the sky.
Meanwhile the women of the State should call for thou
sands of extra copies of .The Sunday Call, and when they call
upon their friends present them with a copy of The Callâ the
first great daily that had sufficient backbone and courage to call
the attention of the voters of California to the fact that women
were knocking at the door and calling for admittance into the
duties and responsibilites of citizenship, and to unite its voice
with theirs in the cali for a halt in the present unjust adminis
tration of public affairs, and demanding that woman shall be
called upon to assist in making laws by which she is taxed m* r .

suffering for the sake of the higher life which v to
come.
The differences net ween men and women are not
to be overcome. Mate will always cost more,
physically and mentally, than fatherhood. It Is
the greatest of all possible errors to attempt to
make women over Into cheap imitations of men.
The "eternal womanly" will always be with us to
lead us on.
Yet the law of evolution In the application to the
higher human life always involves these chases.
Vve pass from a homogeneous, Indlfferentiated
basis, through specialization and differentiation,
to a more organic unity on a higher plane.
Specialization of function Is only a waste of force
unless there is integration or the specialized func
tion in the whole of life. In government we pass
from an indifferent lated unity at the beginning,
through all possible types, good and bad, toward a
certain common tyjie which shall, with the great
est organic unity, give the largest possible freedom
to all. In religion we pass from a simple basis
through all possible beliefs and super
stitions toward a common faith In the ra
tionality of the universe and the one God and
father of us all. similarly, in sex devolopment we
pass from the monogamous family, through all
kinds of conditions, to a monogamous family
which involves, instead of excluding, the widest
specialization of function and life The ideals of
man and woman tend to approach each other and
are united in the Inclusive ideal of the human be
ing. The Ideal man must be Dot only strong and
brave and true, but tender and sympathetic: the
Ideal woman must be not alone loving and sensi
tive and tender, but strong and capable of Inde
pendent life. .Likeness between men and women
is the last thing to be desired, but there can be no
satisfying personal relation without equal freedom
and development.
- Anything which relieves women from the neces
sity of marrying tends to place marriage itself on a
nobler plane. The interests' of men are the in
terests of women. The notion that there is a
necessary struggle for supremacy between the
sexes, and that one conquers at the expense of the
other, is one of the most absurd and pernicious no
tions ever perpetrated upon a patient world.
No regeneration of humanity is to be expected
from giving the suffrage to women. It is only a
step toward freedom: nu". It is such a step, and as
such deserves our cordial support- Out of all the
long struggle of humanity emerges the ideal of
womanhood. It Is the "iCternal Womanly," but
the eternal womanly unhampered by artificial
limitation;. Woman â tender and sensi
tive, but woman strong and true is the modern
ideal; woma , capable of standing alone, and
hence worthy of the deepest human relationsâ
and Is the ideal of which v.-c catch a glimmer, the
new woman â bless and protect her."
A Mr. Howard opened the discussion by
indulging in what promised to develop
into an interminable dissertation upon the
merits and demerits of the "new woman"
considered in the light of sociology and
evolution, but was cut off by the" three
minute limit.
Another gentleman named Benham
spoke of Lady Aberdeen's lace industry in
Ireland as Rood in its way, but would pre
fer to see the land in that country in pos
session of the natives. He scored absentee
landlordism in the strongest terms.
Mrs. Andrews commented upon the new
woman and the new man in a set of orig
inal verses, which were warmly applauded.
Miss Sarah M. Severance read a most
interesting paper on "Woman's Stake in

but was properly a magnificent extempo

The last paper of the evening. was read
by Mrs. Harriet W. Russell-Strong, presi
dent of the Ebell Society of Los Angeles.
Her subject was "The Mother, Old and
New."
"Sparta," she said, "depended in great
part upon its mothers for the noble men
who inhabited that country. Tne Spartan
women were said to be the only ones who
could rule men. The Roman mothers of
old were free women and not household
drudges, and this may have much to do
with the illustrious bravery of their eons.
"Eve undoubtedly strove to teach her
sons the lessons of divine harmony which
she had learned from the lips of the
Almighty. This teaching in the case of
Abel was successful, in that of Cain it ap
pears to aye been in vain; but in each
in.-tance the reaching itspil was the same
and the devoted teacher blameless for un
toward consequences.
"The true mother must labor without
ceasing to bring about the new paradise.
The garden of Eden was not enlivened by
the sound of children's laughter. The
new Eden will be the home of glorious
motherhood. And the glory and crown of
motherhood is that grand, self-renouncing
love which is the very life of liberty."
' The question-basnet was then opened
and the first question was found to be:
"If women vote will they not deprive
men of Government positions?" .
To which Miss Shaw made answer as
! follows:
"The class of men who seek public office
only for their own support," is the class
of men who ought to be put out and
women put in.
"Here is a biblical question: 'Does the
Bible mention woman suffrage? 1 Biblical
. questions teem to bother a good many
people, and often more after men preach
ers have expounded them than before.
The scriptures say God created man and
â¢woman, and made them the rulers of the
earth. The scripture is full of the equality
of man and woman."
Several other questions were answered,
Miss Shaw's ready wit and keen satire de
lighting the audience, while the pith of
all her replies left them with something
to think about. An adjournment was then
taken until to-day.
A magnificent floral anchor was one of the
decorations on the platform last evening.
It was made of Marecbal roses, yellow
sweet peas, ferns and smilax, and was
from Mr?. Annie B. Andrews of .Los
f Angeles, on behalf of the women of
Southern California.
THE THEOSOPHICAL VIEW.
Men and Women Are Equal and
No Distinction Should Be
Made.
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, who is one of
the advanced exponents of theosophy in
this City, declared yesterday that any
statement that theosophists were opposed
to woman's suffrage was absolutely un
true. He held not only that woman was
entitled to suffrage, but that she was
equal to the male of the human species in
â¢everything according to the philosophy of
his society.
"Woman's equality with man in every
particular, including suffrage, is recog
nized completely throughout the Theo
eophical Society," he saia. â¢'Theosophy
teaches that the same Ego, or soul, mani
fests alternately during a series of lives as
male or female as its needs demand. All
manifestation is dual, and human life
necessarily requires its dual manifestation.
This is found in the male and female na
tures, the difference in which is only very
imperfectly expressed in sex. Sex is only
one of the many differences which mark
the swing of the Ego from pole to pole of
manifested human life. Both poles are

To the Editor of The Call:

delight at the bold step you have taken in

recognized philosophically as being abso
lutely equal.
"For a theosophist to say tbat man is
superior to woman, or woman to man,
would imply an almost entire ignorance of
theosophidU puilosophy.
"To give woman the ballot could not
but have a most beneficial effect, for it
would bring a new, purer and more con
servative element into our political life,
and would add very greatly toour stability
as a Nation. The refining influence of
woman at the polls would be just as ap
parent as it is in the home. Aside from
all special pleas, however, the fact that
theosophists look upon the human soul as
sexless, and that sex is only a phenomenom
of form, would show the absurdity of as
signing to woman an inferior place at the
councils of the Nation.
"To the theosophist justice is the key
note of all philosophy, and any denial of
the equality of the sexes would be a posi
tive injustice, and no true theosophist can
make such an assertion.
"Tne reincarnation of the Theosophical
Society in this century was due almost
wholly to the efforts of one woman,
Madam Blavatsky. Theosophv honors
women without attributing to them any
of that false aneelic superiority with
which shallow philosophers clothe them.
THE TRUE JOURNALISM
To the Editor of The Call:
Permit me to congratulate you on your advanced step in true
journalism, the advocacy of the true reforms of the day. I con
sider your issue of yesterday the best you have ever published.
The full and complete report of the speeches at the Woman's

"Holmes Confession" or the "Durrant murder trial" a thousand
times over. May you advance and prosper. Respectfully,

TO AID THE GREAT WEST
An International Exposition of
Trans â¢ Mssissippi
Products.
California Asked to Contribute Money
and Products and Show the World
Her Fertility.
Isaac W. Carpenter, a member of the
board of managers of the Trans-Mississippi
International Exposition Association of
Omaha, Nebr., is in this City for the pur
pose of arranging for an exhibition of
California's products in that city in 1898,
beginning in June and ending in Novem
ber.
The Trans-Miesissippi Association has
been in existence eight years, and has
held meetings during that time consider
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
ing matters of interest to the Western
country; such as the silver Question, the
Nicaragua canal, good roads, etc. At its
meeting in Omaha last November, the
matter of holding an international exposi
tion of the products of the great West was
discussed, and the following resolution
was unanimously adopted:
Whereas, We believe that an exposition of
all me products, industriea and civilization of
the States west of the Mississippi Kiver made
at 8omÂ« central gateway, where the world can
behold the wonderful capabilities of these
wealth-producing States, would be of great
value, not only to the Trans-Mississippi States,
but to all the home-seekers of the world;
therefore.
Resolved, That the United States Congress be
requested to take such steps as may be neces
sary to hold a Trans-Mississippi Exposition at
Omaha during the months of August, Septem
ber and October, in the year 1893, and
that the representatives of such States and
Territories In Congress be requested to favor
such an appropriation as is usual in such
cases to assist in carrying out this enterprise.
Mr. Carpenter said yesterday that it was
the plan to have the association repre
sented by a vice-president in every State
and one from the city of Omaha. He ad
ded that that city had been selected as the
site for the exposition because it was in
the center of a thickly populated portion
of the United States. Within a radius of
500 miles there are States whose combined
population is 20,000,000. The territory
comprising tne trans-Mississippi country
is two-thirds of the area of the whole
United States and has not quite one-third
of the entire population.
The idea of the association was that
Omaha, being near the eastern boundary
of this region, Eastern people could oe
more easily reached and brought there
more easily than they could be induced to
go to any of the more western cities, such
as Salt Lake and Denver.
"We hope to show to the home-seekers of
the East" continued Mr. Carpenter, "that
it is to iheir advantage to come West and
till up this grand and fertile country. Then
will there be a grand market for "Califor
nia's products, for east of the Mississippi
California comes into competition wun
Florida and other heavy fruit-growing cen
ters.
"The Legislature of lowa has already
made an appropriation for the purpose of
assisting to defray the expenses of the ex
position, and the Legislatures of other
States are taking up tbe matter. The Na
tional Congress is now considering an ap
propriation of $250,000. and the bill has
already passed the Senate. The merchants
of St. Louis aud the Chamber of Commerce
of Los Aneeles have adopted resolutions
favoring the exposition. Governor Budd
has appointed Georae W. Parsons of Los
Angeles as vice-president for California.
It is expected that the California Board of
Trade will take up the matter and prepare
an exhibit that will eclipse any that nas
been hitherto made by any State."
Mr. Carpenter will leave for Salt Lake
to-day.
A 517.000 Watch.
"While in Geneva some months ago,"
said Colonel J. R. Reynolds, "I visited the
principal watch works there, and as a
matter of curiosity asked the manager
what was the highest-pricÂ»d watch That
was made in Geneva. He said that the
most expensive watch turned out in Switz
erland was worth $700. This watch had a
split second hand and struck the hours if
needed. It also had in it a tiny musical
box, which played three distinct tunes.
This watch, he said, was tne finest that
could be made, but tbat ornaments, dia
monds, etc.. could be worked into the cases
which would run the price up into as
many thousands as the purchaser desired.
He said there had been one watch made in
his establishment, the ca^es of which ha<l

been studdod with diamonds, and which
hail cost $17,000, but as far as the watch it
self was concerned it was a ?700 watch." â

WEAVER OUT, REDDY IN,
A Change Finally Made in the
Superintendency of the
Almshouse.
TAYLOR'S STERN ARRAIGNMENT
The Acting Executive Pours Hot
Shot Into the Beard ani
the Governor.
The Board of Health guillotine fell upon
the neck of Superintendent Weaver of the
Almshouse yesterday, and unless the
courts sustain him in the contest which
he threatens his watch at the helm of the
City poorhouse is at an cud.
The decapitation was to have taken
place on Wednesday, but at the last mo
ment Dr. Williamson, who some time ago
announced his intention of voting for the
retention of Weaver first, last and all the
time and then changed his mind and
agreed to vote with the majority, experi
enced a change of heart and told i)rs.
Morse, Hart and Fitzgibbon that he
would have to think the matter over.
Yesterday he had been sufficiently braced
up by the other members to vote accord
ing to bis pronii.-e, and the programme
went through without a hitch, except the
usual vociferous wrangle that nas charac
terized the meetings of the present board
ever since its members took their seats.
After the members had come together
with acting Mayor Taylor in the chair
yesterday Dr. Fitzgibbon moved that the
office of superintendent of the Almshouse
be declared vacant.
The chairman refused to entertain the
motion, but an appeal from the decision
was carried and the matter went to a vote.
Before this action was taken, however,
acting Mayor Taylor handed the chair
over to Dr. Morse and said a few words
that made the medical members squirm
in their seats.
After briefly reviewing the fight that had
been made to remove Weaver he said:
"I have found a business economy as
far as the superintendent's personal efforts
are concerned, and when he was not ham
pered by appointees of this board who
were unfit for the performance of the du
ties devolving upon them.
"I say that he has been hampered by in
competent men, who were appointed by
this board, and I can give you names if
I necessary. The public must know it, and
shall know it. The members of the Board
of Supervisorsâ men of average intelli
gence, have examined the institution, and
j they agree it is a mistake to change the
| management. The Grand Jury iuspected
it, and thry have said that it is the best
i managed institution in the City. I don't
know why this matter was brought up
here to-day, for 1 thought that it had
been settJed long ago. PerhaDs it was ex
j pected that I might vote for Mi. Weaver's
i removal without a thorough knowledge of
the facts; but I'm not built that way. I
dent suppose 1 could change the opin
ions of any of you men, if I should talk
from now until "doomsday, but I cay that
the contemplated action of this board is
unjust and undignified. Moreover, I am
inclined to think that it emanated from
the high and exalted position of chief
executive of the .-tutu and that it has de
scended into the tilthy pool of politics to
gratify the lust of a greedy politician.
This man, who lias lived in this commun
ity for half a century and who is known to
be an honest and in upright official, is to
be s-ncrifietd in order that the behests of a
man who has not u.e interests oi this city
at heart, but who is actuated entirely by
political selfishness, shall be rarried out.
If this don't act as a boomerang upon
Democracy, then I am very much mis
taken. Tne consummation of this con
templated outrage upon the community
will never be forgiven."
Not to be outdone, Dr. Fitzpibbon took
the floor and demanded a vote on his
motion, after vehemently denying that he
was a politician or tnat the superin
tendent's removal had any connection with
politics. Drs. Hart, Morse and Fitzgibbon
voted aye promptly , but Dr. Will ianison
had a long explanation to make, the
burden of which was that he was opposed
to the removal of Mr. Weaver, but had
concluded that for the best interests of the
Almshouse, wnich was being injured
through the continual bickering and con
flict of authority, he would vote with the
majority. Chairman Taylor voted no em
phatically.
Dr. Hart moved that Captain Edward
Keddy be appointed to the vacant position,
and the measure carried, Dr. Williamson
refusing to vole and Chairman Taylor vot
ing no.
When Mayor Sutro learned .of the action
tiiken by the Board of Health he expressed
nimselt as follows:
"I am sorry to see that Mr. Weaver has
been removed, fco-called additional evi
dence was submitted to me last Sunday,
professing to make some of his acts appear
criminal. I carefully went through it and
with the explanation that was given me
by Mr. and Mrs. Weaver I am satisfied
that there was no criminal intent and that
the most that can be said about it is that
Mrs. Weaver may have been euilty of
carelessness.
"I believe that on examination by a
proper court, where the value of the "evi
dence would be properly weighed, espe
cially that coming irom discharged em
ployes, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver would be
set before the public in a lignt that they
they would not be ashamed ot."
INDICT HIM IN SECRET.
Cautious to Prevent Public
Knowledge of Grand
Jury Doings.
The Board of Health Did Not Appear
in Response to the Jury's
Request.
The Grand Jury yesterday held an extra
tight secret session in the innermost room
of the inner recesses of the District Attor
ney's office. To reach the sanctum of
secrecy one had to pass through the apart
ments of District Attorney Barnes, J, A.
riosmer, Alfred P. Blact, E. D. Peixotto,
Walter B. Blair, John B. Tungate, Thomas
F. Dunn, Arthur Brand and Robert
Hogan.
The District Attorney cautioned his as
sistants particularly to breathe no whisper
and convey no hint as to the mysterious
doings of the Grand Jury. Each assistant
was loaded with the secret that an indict
ment was pending, but all were instructed
not to come in contact with an outsider
lest the aecret should escape by induction.
Captain Lees also had the secret, and a
half dozen detectives shared the responsi
bility with him of keeping it.
The grand jurors themselves took a
double-riveted oath of secrecy, and to
miike the compact more binding each
gave his personal word of honor to di
vulge nothing of their proceedings until
the man the detectives wanted was caught.
Corked up in this fashion the jury de
liberated. At half-past 4 o'clock Frank
Maskey, foreman, led the column of his
secret-burdened followers to Judge Slack's
courtroom and there presented his Honor
an indictment. The latter read it, and
when be got possession of the secret, of
course, the tension on the others was
slightly relaxed.
When Judge Slack finished reading he
looked at District Attorney Barnes, and
the latter moved that the indictment De
placed on the secret file. To keep the mat
ter secret he went still further and moved
that the name of the person indicted be
not written in the minute-book of the
Clerk. As an extra precaution he asked
permission to withdraw from the posses
sion of the court the indictment papers
and Judg Siack granted this request.
Various stories were soon in circulation
at the City Hail. The fact that W. H.
Crocker oc"o c " the CrocKer- Wool wortn Bank
was a witness in the jury-room gave rise
to the rumor that the "bank had been
cheated by forgery.
Mr. Crocker himself said last night:
"There is no trutn In that story. I was
before the Grand Jury on another matter,
and the bank has nothing to do with the
indictment."
Then another story went the rounds to
the effect that a prominent railroad man
had been indicted for erubezzlement.
This story is flatly denied.
The truth of the matter, so far as can be
ascertained, is this: Captain Lees has dis
covered that a clever crook bearing several
aliases, one of which is plain "Jones," is
in town. The captain feared that any
outside Â»alk about the indictment would
be conveyed to Jones, alias Crook, et al.,
and that the latter would shake the dust
of the peninsula from his garments be
fore the police could him.
The nature of the forgery committed is
not so remarkable and the amount of
money embezzled is not astounding. The
main object in view is to keep Jones in
ignorance of wcat the Grand Jury is doing
and to convince him that our detectives
know when a noted crook is in town.
The Grand Jury expected to hrar mem
bers of the Board of Health yesterday, but
thesp doctors being busy elsewhere in
practical politics, paid little heed to the
request of the jury. Next time tn<Â» request
to bear the members of the Board of
Health may be in the form of a summons.
George Kobertson, the steward of the
City and County Hospital, has been will
ing for some^ time to explain to the jury
why coarse raw su^ar was procured for
the patients. He fancies that he can con
vince the jury that the brown-black raw
sugar is the sweetest thing on earth, al
though it is not of tne grade called for in
the contractor's schedule.
On the sugar question the mind of the
jury is rixed. Arthur Price had samples
of the sugar analyzed and the report of the
analysis is on file.
The Board of Health's presence is de
sired in order that some explanation may
be given as to why the hospital is not kept
clean, why the rooms are unswept and
why old, wooden slopbuckets are left
standing in the kitchen. In a word, the
Grand Jury wants to know why the pa
tients at the hospital cannothave the
civilizing influences of cleanliness in the
establishment.
Last night one of the jurors said :
"I understand the account for the main
tenance of the hospital is already over
drawn to the extent of $9000. The Board
of Health, instead of loosing after hospi
tal affairs, is making a place in the Alms
nouse for a non-resiuent. Affairs have
come to such a pass that public sentiment
will cause the next Legislature to abolish
the State Board of Health entirely, and
then San Francisco can manage the hos
pital and Almshouse without State inter
ference. Thete institutions are supported
by local taxes and should be controlled by
the local governing body. This last out
rage of removing a capable superintendent
to make a place for an outsider is the most
grievous violation of civil service reform
ever committed."
IS BEHELD WITH HORROR
Historic Journey of a Horseless
Carriage Through Ala
meda CouDty.
Two Lauies at Newark and Many
Others Were Glad When It
Had Passed By.
Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, May 8. )
Charles Fair's horseless carriage has
made a streak of history during the past
week. It extends from Oakland to fcau
Jose.
The vehicle that announces its presence
by emitting puffs from the vicinity of its
rear wheels has passed through Alameda
County, and in those neighborhoods
whose commercial life is wrapped up in
strawberry beds and potato patches, and
where the nearest approach to metropoli
tan life is a lamppost with coal oil
illumination, it has created a great sensa
tion.
Several minor accidents are also attrib
uted to it and many unnecessary scares
have furnisned the basis for several stories
of "narrow escapes from death."
In Oakland the machine created genu
ine surprise, but the citizens suppressed
it, not wishing to be taken for residents
of the suburbs of Milpitas. San Leandro
and Haywards saw it and wondered, but
after it left San Lorenzo the denizens of
the vegetable districts laid do^-n their
hoes and gazed with open mouths. The
horses, who had never seen anything more
uncanny than a Chinaman in a passion,
shied and jumped and broke their bay
band harnesses and did considerable dam
age.
At Newark the puffing cart created more
sensation than a traveling circus. It will
long be remembered there and be ranked
as of similar importance to the latest visit
of Cupid in their midst.
Mr. and Mrs. Wills of Newark met the
snorting phenomenom and their horse
at once renounced his allegiance to the
reins, broke his harness and injured him
seif with one of tlie broken shafts.
A lady who was driving with her chil
dren encountered the carriage and her
horse at once bolted. The lady was nearly
paralyzed with fright, but one of the little
children who was carrying her pet dog
clasped her animal in her arms, and after
the gasoline vehicle had passed they
emerged safely from under the seat.
At Milpitas the whole uopulation turned
out to see the novelty. Ail through the
town the party was tendered an ovation,
but there was an agreeable feeling of se
curity wheii the sound of the puffing had
died away. All along the journey there
was an indefinable fear that the thing
might "go oft," but instead it went on till
it reached San Jose.
A Dangerous Friend.
He is the greatest bore in Dallas. We
will, however, not mention bis name, on
account of the libel law. He was talsing
to a crowd about the coming local election.
Referring to an aidermanic candidate, the
bore said :
"Jones is a good man; he 19 capable,
honest, fearless and conscientious. He
will make the very kind of an Alderman
we need. I have special cause to be grate
ful to Jones. He saved me from drown
ing."
â¢'Do you really want to see your friend
Jones elected?" asked a solemn-faced old
man in the group.
"Of course I do," exclaimed the bore.
"Then don't let the voters know that he
saved your liie or he will be snowed un
der."
The group laughed and dispersed. â

HYMEN HAS BEEN HURRIED
The Hobart- Williams Wedding to
Bs Celebrated on Tues
day Next.
AN EASTERN HONEYMOON.
Miss Jenrre Elair Entertains a Num
bjr cf Fr en^s in Honor of
Charles N. Feltoa Jr.
On Tuesday next. May 12, the much
discusÂ«-ed Hobart- Williams nuptials will
be celebrated.
Since the announcement of the engage
ment of this fortunate young couple so
ciety has found their approaching mar
riage a fruitful and interesting theme for
discussion.
Everybody, high and low, rich and poor
alike, have taken as it were a personal in
terest in the gracious and beautiful young
bride and the manly groom.
All agree that the possession of many
millions has not taken a bit iroin the
frank, generous spirit of the young
Croesus, and that of all the society beaux
none are more truly and thoroughly Amer
ican than young Hobart.
Of the beautiful bride there has yet to be
spoken an unkind word. Friends, admir
ers, even rivals, find nothing but the bc-t
and kindest things to say of her. They
dwell upon her modesty, her gracious
charms, her rare beauty and, last but
not least, her unusual mental attain
ments.
The only expressed regret is that the
wedding is to be so quietly celebrat-d. It
is to be a noon ceremony and only the im
mediate relatives, about twenty in num
ber, will be present.
The attending festivities are to be con
ducted with the utmost simplicity, on
account of the extremely delicate health of
the bride's mother, w r ho has been an in
valid for the past sixteen years.
Miss Juliet Williams, the bride's only
sister, is to be the maid of honor and
Harry Stetson the best man.
Miss Ella Hobart, sister of the groom,
is to be the bridesmaid.
After the ceremony the happy young
couple will leave fur an extended' Eastern
visit. They will visit all the principal
Eastern watering placet and at Bar Har
bor will be the guest of Governor Denni
son of Ohio and Mrs. Dennison, cousin of
the bride. They will then return in time
to be at Del Moiite during the shoot. The
winter will be spent in this City at the
Hobart mansion, and next spring the
young millionaire and his bride will tour
Europe.
Miss Williams has already received
many elegant and costly wedding gifts,
prominent among which are a complete
table service of solid cold and a diamond
sunburst, both the gifts of the groom's
sister, Miss Ella Hobart,
Invitations have been issued for the
opening of the Pacific Yacht Club, which.
will take place at the clubhouse at Sausa
lito. The festivities will be held both this
afternoon and evening.

An Old Land Suit Revived.
The case of the United States Government
against the Central Pacific road and others
was before Commissioner Heacock yesterday.
The suit involve* certain mineral lands in
Butte County, entered by the railroad as agri
cultural lands. The suit was filed ten years
ago, but oue of the defendants, Henry Bash
iord, could not be lpoa-fd until IVaduuKilajT

torney proposes to push the case to a final de
cision.
THEY WANT LONG TERMS
The Four- Year-Term Test Cage Is Ar
gued and Submitted â City Of
ficials Interested.
The test case .by which it is hoped to
learn whether or not the present munic
ipal officers hold for two years more or go
out next November came before Judge
Seawcll for argument yesterday.
The action is a suii brought by Julius
Kahn against the Election Commission to
restrain the Commissioners from preparing
for a municipal election next November.
General W. H. L. Barnes and T. C f\>ogan
appeared for the plaintiff and Garrett Mc-
Enemy represented the Commission. The
first proceeding was the filing of a demur
rer to the complaint on the ground that it
did not state facts suincient to form a
cause of action, and on this demurrer the
cause was submitted.
Mi' Enemy took the position that the
county government act, which provides
for the four-year term, did not apply to
the City and* County of San Francisco.
Its provisions did not fit the dual govern
ment of San Francisco in any of the more
important matters and it provided for
officers unknown in this local government.
l *San Francisco," he said, "is not a county.
Its government is totally different from
that laid down by the Jaw for counties
and it has been decided more than once
that it could be considered in no other
way than as a City."
General Barnps in reply said he believed
the act should be made to apply to San
Francisco so far as the character of the
City and County government did not con
flict with the terms oi the law. He argued
that peneral laws, such as the county gov
ernment act. mubt apply to all the State.
If it did not apply to ttie whole State it
would be a general law and under the pro
vi.-ion of the constitution, which forbids
special election laws, the county govern
ment act would then be invalid.
He contended, however, tnat the act di 1
apply to San Francisco, for he said that
some of the provisions plainly showed that
San Francisco's position under the law
had been considered. The act directed
that the compensation of the officers of San
Francisco be t-et at the figures allowed
by the local government, while in the case
of actual counties the salaries were fixed
by the act itself. He said it had been de
cided by the Supreme Court that the City
and County of l^an Francisco was a county,
and he held therefore that the county gov
ernment act, m all but conflicting terms,
should apply here.
Jud<?e Seaweli will render judgment in
the matter in a few days, and then the
case will be taken to ti.e Supreme Court.

HEALTH IN OLD AGE,
An Old Lady Finds the True
Source of Vitality.
A Reporter's In'eresticg Interview
With a Lady of Seventy-two
Years Who Tells a Mar
velous Story.
From the Union, Port Jervis, N. Y.
Bnt a short time ago, in a distant part of the
country, we heard of a cure by the use of Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills, which seemed almost
marvelous, and more recently another sub
slantial evidence oi their value reached our
ears. Being of an inquiring turn of mind,
and wishing to know just how much there was
in the story, a reporter was sent to interview
the person said to be thus benefited. If the
narrative us it hud reached our ears was true,
it was only simple justice to let it be known â
it" it proved untrue, it would be well to know it.
The person alluued to above as having been
thus greatly benefited by the use of Pink Pills
i> Mrs. Jane Hotalen of Hainesvllle, K. J., a
pleasant hamlet in Sussex County, about fif
teen miles from this office. The reporter had
no difficulty in finding Mrs. liotalen. It was
nearly noon when we reached her pleasant
home, a double house, one part of which' is
occupied by her son. She is a pleasant-faced
old lady, looking to be about sixty-five, but is
in reality seventy-two years of age. After a
few preliminary remarks in explanation of the
cuil, >he was a>ked if she had any objection to
Kiving us the details of the case and how she
came to try this now famous remedy.
"Not at all," said she. "it my experience
can be of any good to others, I am sure they
are welcome to itâ it can do me no harm."
"When were yi.u taken sick and what was
the nature of the malady?" was asked.
â¢â¢It was about two veaiS hko. The trouble
was rheumatic in character â sciatica, they
called itâ and it was very puiuiul indeed. The
difficulty began in my hip and extended the
whole length of the limb, crippling me com
pletely. I suffered intensely from it, and the
ordinary treatment gave me not the slightest
alleviation. .1 was under treatment about a
month ago, as stated, but I grew worse instead
of better, and was fast becoming discouraged."
â¢What brought Pink Pills to your notice?"
"My son called mv attention to an article in
a paper, in which it was stated that a Mr.
Struble of Branchville, a village in this county,
had been greatly benefited by their use, and
suggested that it would be a good plan to try
them. But I was skeptical in regard to their
value; in fact, I had no confidence in their
efficacy and rather laughed at the suggestion.
But the trouble increased and I was baaly
crippled. A few days later my son was about
to visit a neighboring town, and suggested
again that it might be well to try this raucii
talked-of remedy, and I then consented. He
bought me a box of them and I began taking
them at once. At the end of a week I noted a
marked improvement, and by the time I had
taken the first box I was able to walk without
a cane. I continued their use, taking several
boxes, and am, as you see, in a very comfort
able state of health."
'â¢Have you had any return of the trouble?',
"Not as yet, thon?h at my time of life,
seventy-two, it would not be surprising if I
should have. If it comes I should at once
begin the use of the pills. I suppose I inherit
a tendency to troubles of this kindâ my mother
died from them."
"Did you ever note any ill effects from the
use of Pink Piils ?"
"None whatever. They never disturbed my
stomach in any way or caused me any annoy
ance. Neither did I find it necessary to in
crease the dose, as the directions say maybe
desirable. I am able, as you see, to attend to
my own work."
The reporter thanked Mrs. Hotalen for her
courtesy and bade her good-day, it is not often
that one can witness such a complete recovery
from such a pertinacious trouble at such an.
, advanced age, and such instances cannot fail
to produce a profound impression. Readers of
the L'nion may rely on the absolute aecuracv of
ail the statements here givenâ nothing "has
been exaugerated. nothing withheld.

densed form, all the elements necessary to give

refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Wh n the pressure la high in the intcrioi
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when Â«the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in tile vicinity of Idaho, and
trip pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected In summer and colder

will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, li.t.. May 8. â Although wheat
opened firm this morning there was lacking to the
tone that buoyancy and vigor which were the pre
vailing characteristics yesterday. The modera
tion in strength was doubtless caused by the
Weather Bureau's report on Kansas for yesterday,
which gave the maximum temperature in that
State at 88 degrees. Chinch-bug reports were still
in circulation, but a more conservative tone to the
dispatches referring to tnem . was noticeable. A
bull disappointment lay in the Liverpool cables.
which did not fully respond to yesterday's bulge on
this side. An advance of but Vi 1 ' was quoted nt
that place.
Receipts at Chicago were 12 cars am! 87.000
bushels were taken from store. North western
arrival were 351 cars against 486 last Friday and
154 a year ago. Berlin closing cables were 1 to l A /i
marks higher. Paris was unchkoced to 5 centimes
lower for flour and unchanged for wheat. Antwerp
wag unchanged. Kxport Clearances were light at
233,161 bushels. Opening prices were the best for
the day, the market declining gradually during
the balance of the stolon, the close being at
almost the Inside. July wheat opened from t>4 ' 4
@,t>4V2C, declined to 63% c, closing at 6814 c, s^c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row, 10 cars.
Coraâ Finding no help in the Wheat market, this
morning was disposed 10 relinquish a portion of
yesterday's enhancement. Ibe parties who had
covered felt inclined to reins:ate their trades, the
performance of which proved detrimental to
prices. Liverpool cables were quiet and steady.
Keceipis were 145 cars and â¢J54.-JHI bust. els were i
taken from store. Export clearances were -67,
-262 bushels. July Corn opened at SUS/gi-, sold be
tween 30y 2 @ > 295 /^c, closing at 29^ic y^^c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor- !
row 145 cars.
oais lust a part of yesterday's appreciation
throueh weakness derived from the other markets.
The hot weather was not conducive to exertion,
and traders were disinclined to do much business.
Receipts were 141 cars, and 69,620 bushels were
taken from store. July Oats closed undir yes
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 145
cars.

PROVISIONSâ No encouragement was to be
obtained from the hog market which was weaker
at 5(5, 10c lower tty* morning, consequently prod- i
uct made no attempt at advancing. The weakness
of gram was also an adverse influence. At the
close July pork was 17Vjc under yesterday; July

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N.Y., May 8.-R. G. Dun A Co.
in their weekly review of trade to-morrow will say
The exports of 96,850,000 gold this week have pn>
dured no monetary disturbance, and this Is at once
proof of the soundness of financial conditions and
of. the prevailing confidence In better things to
come. It do>s not matter. whether the gold is re
quired for Russia or anywhere else: it would not
go from this, rather than other countries. If there
were not balances to meet. Much of the hesitation
at present U due to temporarily reduced demand
in some industries, and in iron and steel the power
fit tl>e new combination Is being generally tested
by refusal of crders, so tha. production exceeds
consumption, but the low consumption exceeds
new b':yin;r. â "â '.'-.â¢ â .:''â â 
ThÂ«geueml irregularity of. prices and slackness
of demand for finuii . d products does not prevent
the marking up 01 prices by combinations, but are
largely due to doubt whether such prices as are
fixed can be maintained. Piglron is weal: at the
East and also at Pltrsburg; tin steady and lead
hlielilly lower, and American t;nulate 30c below
foreign. â¢ ; - . . * . .- â¢â¢ â¢ . ....â-..â¢<
For textile manufactures the situation is trying
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
Cotton mills have a fairly active demand, though
not equal to their normal output, and for many
months have been accumulating goods, hoping for
better things, so that some are now stopping, al
though the demand for good grades, with higher
prices for cotton, has helped to a small advance In
nrtces.
Print cloths are %c higher, but some other
crudes have declined, no that the average of all
quotations is slightly lower.
Woolen innnutactnrers find prices of wool sag-
Ktnjl both here and abroad. The decline at London
reaches about 6 per cent, while the average of
quotations by Coates Bros.. Philadelphia, was
nearly 1 per cent lower May 1, and prices have
ix-cii further reduced by concession to clear off
stocks.
At the West traders are buying much above the
parity of seaboard prices and many growers are
refusing to sell, believing that the upward spurt
of last year will be repeated. Sales for the week
have been less than half a week's full consump
tion.
Men's woolens show no improvement, out there
is more active buying in (tunnels, and the demand
for fancy dress goods Is encouraging, though for
plain goods it ii but moderate.
Cotton speculation has lifted the spot price to
8.31 cents, and profits have been realized from the
men who bkve bold cotton they did not own; but
it is still the fact that tbe outlook for next fall's
crop ib unusually favorable, while stocks here and
abroad exceed all possible demands under Septem
ber 1.
Failures for tbe week have been 238 in tbe
United States against 227 last year, and 24 in
Canada against 34 last year.

THE STOCK MARKET.
ThÂ« Boom- in Mining Stocks Increase*
in Force. ' t '
Yesterday was the most exciting day yet in the
present boom. Business was very - heavy and
prices made a farther advance. Sates on the noon
informal session were enormous, and Chollar
touched S2 63. Potosl $1 10, Best A Belcher * 1 30.
Yellow Jacket 80c, Con. Cal. <tt Va. $3 30, Ophlr
$1 90, Hale <Â£ Norcross $1 60, and so on. Occi
dental reversed the order, 'and touched its best
price on the morning session, selling up to $2 30
and falling back to $165 on the noon session,
though it subsequently recovered to 92 25. Thls (
stock has been very freaky during the cxc ltemen
of the past four or rive days.
On the afternoon call there was a lull in trading
and sales were much smaller, with a correspond
ing decline in prices. . Chollar fell to 91 95, Potosi
to 91 05, Con. Cal. & Va. to $2 90, and so on. Some
of the lower priced stocks, however, showed an ad
vance over the noon session.
The close was dull and prices wore generally
lower, though Chollar recovered to $2 20 and Po
tOM to $1 10. The lower priced stocks were all off
ami weak. UTitiiTfli
The sudden boom has caught more or less deal
ers napping as usual, and the announcement of the
failure of several firms of brokers showed that the
sharp advance is dealing bard blows to the shorts.
The annual meeting of the Hutchln.son Sugar
Plantation Company will be held -May 12.
The annual meeting of the Christy Mining Com
pan v has been called for May 18.
The .sigkiyou Consolidated Mining Company of

Charles W. liaskell, superintendent of the Sa
vannah mine, reports under date of May 2 us fol
lows:
We have just made a fine shot in drift and stope.
Quartz . coming in very heavy again in the drift,
and it Is that quality of ore which has always pros
pected well. The stope is giving us a good quality
of quartz. The worK is being pushed right ahead.
We fired shots this noon, and will have machine
set up ready for work by 6 this evening. All pro
visions, iron, tools, fittings, etc , received yester
day. I have the road In excellent condition again
and all repairs from the storm completed. The
Wideawake continues to delight me, though the
quartz does not yet prospect. Ihe ledge is getting
nice and solid.

FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
A decline in Eggs is the only change in dairy
produce
Hens are rather cheaper. Meats show no change, '
Fish is about as usual.
Fruits sell at last week's prices as a rule, but all
Spring kinds, such as Cherries, Berries, etc., are
dearer than usual, as the frosts cut down the sup
piv materially.
Vec<'tables are about the same.

Fishy, but Possible.
You can believe this or not, as you
choose, but every man at the Locks will ;
tell you it is so.
While the pleasure-seekers were gazing ]
indolently into the canal, thinking how >
much better time they were having than ,
those fellows down there in the town, they s
saw a ripple on the water. ,
The next thing they discovered was a
catfish, nine inches long, suspended some ]
little distance from the water and coming s
in thfir direction. As it got nearer they
saw that the poor little fish was tight in
the grasp of a huge water-snake, ten or }
twelve feet long. After coming very near
the ba# k the snake discovered the 1â¢<
pleasure-seekers, and. seeing that he could {
not land and gorge himseif, he swam l
around in circles waiting until some of the
boys sent a negro for a shotgun. After be- i
ing shot the snake, having nothing further
to do, sank to the bottom.â Atlanta ]
Chronicle.
Got the Wrong Mini.
Old Mr. and Mrs. Shuman, from Bryan, i
went to town, and in coins to the hotel !
for dinner saw a crowd around the Jus
tices' Court, says the Atlanta Constitu- !
tion. The old couple, with pardonable
curiosity, inquired the cause of the gather
ing. They were informed that a man was
on trial for beating his wife. Edging their
way through the bystanders to get a look
at the prisoner, the old lady whispered to
her husband: "What a murderous look-
Ing creature the prisoner is! I'd be afraid
to get near him." "Hush!" warned bar
husband. "That isn't the prisoner; he
hasn't been brought in vet. "It isn't?
Who is it, then?" "It's the Judge."

but contrary to all former high winds this
one had a particular political signifi

It is well known that politics dominate
everywhere in this city from the purchase
of municipal tead pencils to the water
front suit, but this is the first time that
Boreas has come to the aid of any one
party in a political campaign and the dol
lar-tax limit received its first black eye.
All through the day the streets were
practically "out of sight." Dust, posters,
rubbish, signboards, wrecks of awnings
and other things having a tendency to
blind people and cause them to imperil
their souls filled the air, but not a sprink
ling cart was in sight.
The ordinary citizen would not have
cared had the tax levy been $1 or 1 cent.
The elderly gentlemen and their wives 1
â¢would have signed a petition for it to be
increased to dollars. The bloomer girl on
her wheel would not have cared had the
Jevy bankrupted her sire if only a surplus
would thereby be created to pay for a few
sprinkling carts.
The merchants, anxious as many of
them are to possess real estate, would
rather have sacrificed a few cents pÂ«r
centum than put up with the amount of
realty that spread itself all over their
stores and played havoc with fine goods
and finer features, thereby keeping their
customers at home.
The Non-Partisan members of the Coun
cil danced a war quadrille, the Mayor
looked somewhat despondent, and the
people on the streets spent their time
about equally between chasing their hats
and paying their respects to the dollar tax j
limit.
When the many patrons of the daily
papers looted on their porches and dis
covered that their news budgets were in '
the next vacant lot. they almost wished
that the soiid nine was in power again j
and every ward heeler enthroned on a
sprinkling-cart.
On Broadway the only reliefs to the
clouds of dust were the numerous hats
and other articles that were flying through
the air. At Eleventh and Broadway a
lady was hit by a flying sign this after
noon and injured, but not seriously. Su
perintendent of Schools MoClymonds was
forced to walk six blocks after a cable-car
had churned his silk tile to pieces.
After noon, when it became apparent
that the clouds of dust were liable to
cause an accident at the junction of San
Pablo avenue, Telegra h avenue and New
Broadway, where tnree car systems cross,
a solitary cart made its appearance and
travel was somewhat safer.
It was certainly the heaviest wind expe
rienced here this season and the most un
pleasant day Oaklanders have known.
The old courthouse chimney that has
been swayine to and fro in the wind for
years was the cause of much uneasiness
to-day. The County Clerk called the Fire
Warden and some additional .guys were
ordered to be attached to the tottering
flue.

An Impostor at Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., May B.â A woman has
been going about from house to house re
cently asking for money to buy milk for
the orphan asylum*. She claims to be from
the West Oakland Home, the Temiscal
Children's Home and the Finch

posed to buy a carload of condensed milk
to feed the babies in these institutions, be
ciuse by purchasing in that way it can be
obtained much cheaper than in small
quantities.

spelled properly.

ELECTRIC POLES GO UP,
A March Stolen Unexpectedly |
on the City Authorities
of Alameda.
Lots SoM for a Delinquent Assess
mentâBrotherhood of Andrew
and Phillip.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May B.â When the
hole dug at the southeast corner of Clem
ent avenue and Chestnut street was filled
in by Mr. Delanoy's forces, it was sur
mised that the project bad been volun
tarily abandoned by the Delanoy- Lloyd-
Fort Wayne Company. As the day wore
on, however, the reason became apparent.
The hole was in ths wrong place. New
hoies were sunk, and early in the afternoon
three poles were erected and a wire
stretched. There are nine men at work at
present shaving and cleaning the totems
which originally did service at the Mid
winter Fair. . Lanterns are to be affixed to
the masts to-night and a watchman em
ployed to prevent their being removed.
Lilncoln Avenne.
ALAMEDA, Cal., May B.â The cele
brated Lincoln avenue occupied the atten
tion oi the Street Superintendent for a^ few
minutes this mortiing, when a number of
the 102 parcels of land iucludsd in the dis
trict to be benefited r>y the opening were
to have been sold. Scarcely any one was
present and only two lots were disposed of.
G. L. Birkraaier s lot was sold to Scuool
Superintendent Sullivan for $66 65 and one
of Mrs. Cohen's was obtained by C. H.
Tebbs for $28 85. The sale was tuen con
; tinuod nnt.il to-morrow. The total assess
i ments delinquent amount to about $6000.
The injunction suit that Judge Greene dis
solved yesterday was the third one insti
| tuted to pievent dealing with the prop
erty. The first one was defeated through
Cohen lobbying a bill through the Legis
lature repealing part of the law favorable
to the city, and the second was lost through
n technicality.

West End Berkeley Republicans.
Eminent Suffragists to Spsak in
Public Shortly.
BERKELEY, Cal., May B.â Berkeley's
flower show opened this morning at Shat
tuck Hall, and an exhibition of more rare â 
and highly cultured bloom?, especially!
roses and pelargoniums, lias been seldom
seen. The large hall was completely
filled with exhibits of the most select sort,
and those who are prominently connected
with the displaying of Berkeley's beauti
ful flowers say that the show will prove to
be eminently more successful than the one
held last year. Several of the exhibitors
have come from San Francisco with their
contributions, and the interest generally
is widespread. La France and Cecil
Bruner rose 3, beside Shirley poppies, be
gonias. Delargoniums and pansies were
I greatly in evidence.
A throng of visitors continued to pour
J into the hall throughout the day, but to
| night the building was fairly crowded
! with a galaxy of young and fair maidens,
who Lad come to see the display and to
listen to the musical programme. The
show will continue all day to-morrow and
until 10 o'clock In the evening.
Just within the entrance to the hall
stands a huge jar of Shirley poppies, ex
hibited by Mrs. Frank Wilson of Scenic
Park, and on a table further in the room
is an extraordinary large display of mam
moth marguerites.
Miss Bolton has a large vase of poppies,
and Mis 3 Goldstein of San Francisco offers
an extensive display of pansier raised by
her own hand. Perhaps the most strik-
I mc exhibit in the buiUmg is that of J. F.
Sims, an amateur, whicb consists of the
choicest varieties of roses and pelargo
niums. An entire side of the room is laken
up with his display. The Peralta Park
residents have a large bank of peiargorni
ums on exhibition, and Dr. Wellendorf h
name may be seen on several vases of
large La France roses. Hutchinson & San
born of Oakland have also an extensive
display of cut flowers of various sorts and
potted plants.
In Readiness for Class Day.
BERKELEY, Cal., May B.â Great prep
arations are being made by the senior
class of the State University of California
for their class-day exercises, which Will
be held to-morrow, a complete programme
of which appeared in this morning's issue
of The Call. Tbey say that the pro
gramme outlined will be carried out to I
the letter, notwithstanding the fact that
to-day has been windy and threatening.
The fraternity houses, at whicti guests !
Will be received at luncheon, are being
decorated and put in order in preparation
for the greatest day of festivity in all the
college year. To-morrow being the day of
transition for the various classes, battered
plugs, smashed canes and torn mortar
boards wili doubtless be very much in evi
dence, according to the traditional custom
of collegians to dishevel the headgear of
he classmen below them on class day.
The central feature iv the exercises of
the day will be the performance in the
amphitheater back of the chemistry build
ing at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
In the evening the glee club will jÂ»ive
their final concert of the term at Stiles
Hall.
" '98" on Goat Island.
BERKELEY. Cal., May B.â As a pre
cursor of the class performances which
will take place to-morrow at the univer
sity, and as a sign of victory, some un
known members of the sophomore class
inscribed with whitewash a huge " '98" on
the eastern slope of Goat Island last night.
The right to place their class number
wherever they choose is not disputed by
! the freshmen, as they have been defeated
by the "sophs" in every rush and other
contest in which the two classes have
been pitted.
On account of their prowess and abso
lute predominence over the freshmen the
sophomores, who will become juniors to
morrow, will be permitted to wear "skull
ana cross bones" on their white plugs.
The class of '98 will be. the first class in
many years which has the juat right to
j wear this emblem of bravery.
West End Republicans.
BERKELEY, Cal., May 9.â An im
portant meeting of tha West Berkeley Pro
gressive Club was held last evening, at
which the issues of the coming Presi
dential campaign were discussed at length.

and financial questions and urged the club
members to Jamiliarize themselves with
the issues of the day in order that they
might become mora thorough-going Re
publicans. John 'league followed with a
few remarks on the silver question.
It was the general sentiment of the
.meeting to form a marching club to be in 1
readiness to appear in the coming cam
paign processions.

CANNOT SEE THE TICKET MAN
Chief Lloyd Is Eoing Some Thinking.
Result of a Former
Thought.
Oakland Office Sas Fbakctsco Call, )
908 Broadway, May 8. j
Big Jim, the lottery king from across tho
bay, has paid many thousands of dollars
into the city treasury for fines for his
agents here since Chief of Police Lloyd
took office. He has become tired of it, and
in casting around for possible relief he has
devised a plan that is at least ingenious,
though it is not proof against law and
order.
The main point brought out by the
prosecution has been that of identifica
tion. The purchaser has always been able j
to swear positively that tlie Chinaman in |
the dock was the actual seller of the
ticket. This conclusive testimony has
been very expensive to the lottery men,
and they have directed all their energies
toward finding a scheme to offset it. They
were rejoicing that they had found it, when
they were suddenly disappointed.
A few days ago the many gambling
joints vere all provided with very heavily
built partitions. Behind this partitiou sits
the man who sells the tickets. In the par
tition is a hole just large enough for a
man's hand to pass through.
A Chinaman sits between the entrance
and the partition and asks the prospective
purchaser what is wanted. A little con
versation follows and then a hand is poked
through the hole with the desired number
of tickets in it, and is not withdrawn until
the money is placed in the yellow palm.
This plan has worked like a charm. The
pnrchaser could not see from whom he
purchased the ticket, and consequently
could not identify him. Under these cir
cumstances a successful prosecution would
be impossible, and so the customary ar
rests have fallen off of late.
Last night the scheme nearly came to a
sudden end. A private detective went to
a joint on Eighth street, between Broad
way and Washington. The questions
were asked and the sleek hand was pushed
through the hole.
But no money was put in it. Instead, a
handcuff was very deftly placed around
the wrist by the detective. There was a
loud howl, and, although the detective
huug on with all bis strength to the com
panion handcuff, he could not hold his
own. Probably not less than half a dozen
hands were pulling on the inside, and the
other cuff was jerked out of the detective's
hand.
A few seconds later the handcuffs were
pushed through the hole, and, after the
slide was let down, the outside sentinel
announced that business for the day was
over.
The partitions are made particularly I
strong, and even should a posse of police .
raid one of the protected joints they are :
so strongly built that there would be j
ample time for the t.cket-seller to escape,
before an entrance could be effected.
"I am uoing a little thinking," said
Chief Lloyd to-day, "and do not care to
tell in advance what may be done."
A few weeks ago Chief Lloyd did some '
thinking, and a few nights later forty j
Chinamen were landed in the City Prison,
and Big Jim had to produce nearly $1500
to procure their license.
REPAIRED THE BRIDGE.
The Mayor Conducts Operation* on the,
Kighth-Street Trestle.
OAKLAND, Cal., May B.â This after
noon Mayor Dav!e took a force of four
men and went to the Eighth-street bridge
to repair it and to remove the fence
placed there yesterday by Street Superin
tendent Miller.
When the bridge was reached, his Honor
and the four men crawled underneath to
hunt for decayed stringers, and wherever
one was located the men removed the
planking and nailed a new plank on each
side of the rotten timber. After this was
completed, a few old worn flooring planks
were taken out and new ones put in.

OAKLAND, Cal., May B.â Under the
existing ordinance the Auditor cannot
draw his warrant unless the requisition
has been signed by the Mayor. The Coun
cil has authorized the purchase of supplies
in several instances recently, but the
Mayor has refused to indorse the requisi
tion. This is the case with Joseph Har
ris, and it is probable the auditor will be
mandamused so as to get the law passed
upon.

Ingleside yesterday with such terrific
force that it was almost found necessary
to strap the jockeys on their mounts to
prevent them from taking aerial fliehts and
landing outside of the high fence inclosing
the grounds. The backstretch was a
veritable toboggan slide, but when it came
to breasting the gale through the stretch
for the wire the horses made slow progress
and r^ords stood in no danger of being
shattered. The card, a very good one for
an off day, attracted the customary crowd
of racing enthusiasts. As three favorites,
a second choice and one outsider that was
well supported stepped across the line in
front they had no cause for complaint.
In the way of riding honors Frank
Coady stood away over his brother knights
of the pieskin, the Lome and Cambridge
stables' clever jocicey piloting four of the
six winners to victory.
The curtain-raiser was a six-furlong spin
for maidens, with seventeen starters. After
disappointing the talent on one or two oc
casions in the past Montgomery went out
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
and won like a real good one, after open
ing at a very short price and going back in
the betting to 8 to 5. The 9to 5 second
choice, Cadenza, finished tnird Behind the
15 to 1 outsider, Verdette.
The Pueblo stable's Racine filly Dura
was a prime favorite over the other six
starters in the four and a half furlong dash
for two-year-olds, the ring quoting her at
3to 5. Si.c was beaten through a loitering
sort of ride on the part of her rider,
Snider. He rated along between the
leaders so long that when he did make his
move he could not catch the second choice,
Lodestar, losing the decision by a neck.
Lady Hurst, a 100 to 1 chance, finished in
the show several lengths away.
Ed Corrigan's Kowalsky was considered
a "moral" for the six-furlong selling event
that followed, but through a series of
knocks and interferences Lad to be con
tent with third place. Four to rive was
accepted about the brown colt as a good
price. After Candor and Elmer F had
headed the procession into the stretch
Schnitz shot to the front and won cleverly
by a length. In a drive the favorite was
nosed out for the place by Elmer F. The
winner's price was 8 to 1 at post time.
Another favorite went astray in the
mile and a sixteenth run. On thestrength
of his defeat of Fair Faith some days ago
Carroll's gray colt, Paros, was played
down from 2% to 1 to 8 to 5 favoritism.
Little Cripple had second call in the Bet
ting, but the big play was made on Peter
the Second, a raft of coin going in on him
at Â±}4 to 1. The favorite was knocked
about at the first turn, and cut little figure
in the race thereafter, finishing a poor
third. Peter the Second made nearly all
of the running, and in a hard drive
Coady got him past the wire a head before
the 12 to 1 outsider, Mirambo, with little
I'rawley in the saadle.
A mile dash for the cheaper class of
selling platers furnished another exciting
finish. Wawona was the most fancied of
the nine starters, ruling a 2 to 1 choice,
and in a rattling drive the last furlong with
Hermanita, one of the second choices, Si
McClain landed the favorite first by a
neck. Huntsman, at long odds, ran a
creditable race, finishing a good third.
The Texan horse George Miller met with
better success in the last nice than on his
previous essay, when he was left at the
post.
The distance was six furlongs, and about
the only one of the other five starters that
looked to have a chance to take his
measure was the black horse Bueno. In
the betting Miller was a 6 to 5 favorite,
with 2}Â£ to 1 against Bueno, which was
later played down to 2. Not in the first
three when the barrier went up. Miller
soon showed in the lead, and was not after
headed. Bueno came strong at the end,
but in a hard drive succumbed by a head.
Babe Murphy was a close third.
m
INGLESIDE'S STAR EVENT.
The Great $7500 Spreckels Handi
cap Is to Be Decided
To- Day.
The great $7500 Spreckels handicap at
four miles will be decided at Ingleside this
afternoon. Six dorses are carded to force
the issue, and if all start a grand contest is
assured. On paper, the result looks to lie
between Pepper and G. B. Morris, but Sir
Reel has been taking to his work very
kindly of late, and if he starts is act to
prove a dangerous factor in the race.
Long-distance races were always popular
R-ith the California racegoing public, and
the management look for the largest crowd
jf the long meeting to see the Dig event
run. Additional cars will be run by the
jlectric line to accommodate the* vast
throng.
Quirt, the Iron mare, died of a complica
tion of disorders at the Bay District track
Thursday night. The chestnut daughter
jf Joe Hooker and Trifle, foaled in 1887,
tvas a great favorite with racegoers. Dur
ing the long meeting held at the Hay Dis
trict tract a year ago she met and defeated
some of the very best horses in training at
the sprintine distances. Had she been
started in selling events many more wins
would have been placed to her credit, but
her owner, William Dixon, fearful of los
ing the mare, started her only in condition
races and handicaps.
Bookmaker Frank Eckert will leave for
Chicago at the close of the present Ingle
side meeting.
The coming meeting on the Bay Dis
trict will ring down the curtain on the
jcene of many a hard-foughtequine battle,
traders will soon after bejin operations,
siud modest dwellings will cover the
iround where thousands of dollars were
made and lost.
Hermanita's saddle slipped, for which
the backers of Wawona may be truly
srateful, for but for this mishap the mare
would undoubtedly have beaten the favor
ite out.
Flammifer, the Spreckels entry in the
maiden race, refuse! to break and was left
at the post. He is a very likely looking
colt, by Flambeau from the good mare
Not Idle.
The City Guard's Drill.
The City Guard Club will give what It calls
an "extended order drill and sham battle" on
Sunday next. There will be two platoons en
gaged, the first of tall men, under the com
mand of Lieutenant Sturdivant, and the
second, or small men, under command of
Lieutenant Ramm. The engagement will be
followed by target practice.

BURGLARS WHO
STUCK AT NOTHING.
Robbed, Drugged and At
tempted Arson in One
House.
MUCH LOOT SECURED.
Holes Cut in Outside Doors and
Every Sign of Desperate
Workers.
THE POLICE ARE NOTIFIED.
A. Schmitt's Residence on Buchanan
Street Daringly Entered by
Unknown Thieves.
A daring burglary was committed at the
residence of August Schmitt. 1719 Bu
chanan street, on last Thursday evening,
between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock.
Entry was made by the burglars cutting
two holes in the lattice door which leads
into an alleyway between 1719 and 1717
The Lattice-Door Cut Through by the
Burglars.
Buchanan street, the bouse adjoining the
one burglarized. Tne necessity of cutting
the two holes in the door is accounted for
by the fact that in addition to the usual
lock which is generally used upon such
doors there was on this one a bolt a few
inches above the lock. The thieves after
having cut the first hole and shooting the
lock bolt back found that they could not
gain an entrance by reason of the bolt.
Consequently it was found necessary to
cut another, which was done, and the bolt
removed. From here an entrance into the
yard was gained and access obtained to
the back porch, where the kitchen window
was forced open by being pried with a
jimmy from the lower sill, where an in
dentation was left by forcing the iron,
under the window-frame.
Througn this window an entry was
made, when the kitchen door was un
locked, through which a fret passage into
the house was made easy.
The thieves evidently lost no time in set
ting about their work, with an evident de
termination to gut the premises and after
ward set it on tire. This was made mani
fest by their having removed the burners
on the gas gets in the dining-room and
turning on the gas in full force. The gas
-had been ignited, permitting the flame to
reach the ceiling, when the paper would
easily catcb lire and in time spread to the
woodwork and consume the entire build
ing.
Beyond all this an attempt to take the
life of August Schmitt, the proprietor,
whom' the burglars had chloroformed in
his bed while asleep, adds to the crime a
much darker hue and toes to show that
neither life or property baa" any value in
the estimation of the vagabonds who en
tered Mr. Schmitt's house.
The time of the burglary is accounted
for by tne movements of the family during
the early part of the evening. Martin
t-chmitt and his sister Miss Erstine, son
and daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Schmitt,
had gone to a party, leaving their father
. and mother at. home. Eugene, a younger
son, was attending ; to his father's wine
store, on Montgomery street, near Clay.
About 8:30 o'clock Mrs. Schmitt went
across Buchanan street to visit a friend's
bouse, and Mr. Schmitt went to bed about
9 o'clock. One hour later Eugene re
turned home from the store, and on his
arrival at the house he found that while
his key would revolve the bolt in the door-

lock s r et the door would not open. This
unusual circumstance, together with the
fact that all the rooms in the house were
lighted up with a full head of gas, in
cluding the dining-room, caused him to
wonder what was the matter.
After repeatedly trying bis key and find
ing that he could not enter be kicked on
the door three or four times. This no
doubt surprised the thieves at their work,
as he heard from his position on the out
side what he considered the footsteps of
two persons running down the carpeted
stairs. But as tbe door was not opened
by those on the inside he renewed the
noise and at the same time called loudly
for ii is father.
After a while a response was heard on
the inside and Schmitt Sr. came down
stairs and, by removing a heavy parlor
chair which had been placed against the
door with the back securely placed under
the doorknob, he let his son in. No sooner
had he gained an entrance than he be
came convinced that something wns
wrong. His father was in a dazed condi
tion and Had found his way downstairs in
a sort of a mechanical way without being
able to comprehend the situation.
An examination of the house by young
Schmitt soon convinced him that burglars
bail been at work. Every room in the
building had been visited ana bureau
drawer* were emptied and the contents
strewn npon the carpets.
A satchel which was hanging in a closet
in his mother's bedroom was taken out
and cut from Bide to side with a knife and
a purse containing quite a sum of money
was taken and the satchel then thrown to
one side. The cutting of the leather was
necessary to get at tne contents as it had
been locked.
In Mr. Schmitt's sister's room every
piece of jewelry that belonged to her, ex
cept what she had on her person, was
missing. An examination of the dining
room showed the evil intentions of the in
truders where they had removed the burn
ers of the gas jets and permitted the
flames to reach the paper ceiling, which
would in a short time prove disastrous.
After taking a hasty survey of the depre
dations committed Eugene tried to get
some account of the whereabouts of his
mother and other members of his family,
but any attempt to gain this information
from his father was futile, as that individ
ual had no recollection of what occurred
and hardly knew where he was or with
whom he was conversing. It was quite
evident that He had been chloroformed by
the burglars when they entered the room
where he was in bed.
The police were notified by telephone
and Officer Clancy soon put in an appear
ance and took a survey of the premises,
leaving the usual caution not to give any
information to the press, an injunction
which in part was tried to be observed by
Martin Schmitt, who when seen last night
by a Call representative said: "It was
simply nothing."
When asked if he considered a burglary,
an attempt to burn the bouse and the
chloroforming of his father as nothing, he
shrugged his shoulders and only an
swered: "Well, we don't wish any no
toriety."
By an oversight the thieves failed to
find a gold watch belonging to Mrs.
Schmitt, which she values very highly.
She accidentally left it on the mantel
piece, under a mat, concealed from view.
It is supposed that an exit was made in
the samo manner as had been the entry,
as no signs could be found of the thieves
having got away over the back fences.
This is not the first crime that has been
committed in tuis locality within a short
period. The house adjoining Mr. Schmitt's
â 1721 â was entered about two months ago
in a similar manner as was its neighbor on
Thursday night, and the premises ran
sacked from top to bottom.
STANDS BY SPRECKELS.
Republican Executive Council on
McKinley, the Platform and
Suffrage.
The Council Will Have Permanent
Headquarters and Boom Organi
zation Work.
The Republican Executive Council held a
comparatively brief but an important and
spirited regular meeting in Judge Bahrs'
courtroom last evening under the guid
ance of President M. Cooney and Secre
tary Oscar Tolle.
The couucil made three declarations on
motion of S. M. Williams, all of which
were adopted with applause, especially the
first one, which was as follows:
The Hon. William McKinley of Ohio is the
choice of the Republican Executive Council of
Californi* for President of the United States,
and in the event of hin nomination the council
shall u-e all legitimate means and make all
honorable efforts tor his election.
The other expressions which were put in
the form of declarations rather than reso
lutions were as follows:
The council heartily approves the platform
of principles adopted by the Republican State
Convention recently held in the City of
Sacramento.
The Women's Republican State Central Club
of California is entitled to much credit for the
work performed in the interest of universal
suffrage in this State.
Then the following resolution was
adopted with hearty applause:
Resolved. That this council has the utmost
and abiding confidence in the action of John
D. SpreckeU as the foremost, leader of the
Republican party in this City and County.
The council will favor regular and per
manent headquarters. Last evening Oscar
Tolle, chairman of the committee on head
quarters, reported progress and the com
mittee was given until the next meeting,
by which time a selection will be made.
The Supreme Court building and two or
three other central locations are under
consideration.
The Republican Executive Council, as
most Republicans know, is composed of
two delegates from the affiliated clubs.
The council now ha 9 perfected the organi
zation of clubs in all of the Assembly dis
tricts of the City, and clubs in Oakland,
Aiameda and Sacramento are represented
in it. From now on the work of organiza
tion will proceed steadily throughout the
State, and when the National campaign
opens after the St. Louis Convention the
organization will proceed to whoop things
up.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 9, 1896.
PROMOTIONS IN THE ARMY
The New Salvation Commander
Advances Several of His
Officers.
THEY ARE TO START A FARM.
Interview With the Mayor's Secre
tary, Taylor Rogers, Concern
ing the Matter.
Commander and Mrs. Booth-Tucker, the
consul, accompanied by Major Lewis and
Major No.'an, left last evening for the
north â Portland, Tacoraa and Seattle.
They expect to be in New York not later
than two weefcs from date.
They go away well satisfied wiih the
Salvation Army of the Pacific Coast, as
well as with their own labors here.
Despite the continued illness of the con
sul and the hurry of the commander inci
dent to the brevity of his visit they have
accomplished much. These handicapping
circumstances submerged them with busi
ness. They have successfully wrestled
with it and have gone away to other fields
with the jubilant consciousness that their
soldiers are loyal and tiiat their officers
are steadfast and may be trusted to push
the work with renewed enercy.
Yesterday morning the commander and
consul held a meeting with the officers
ana they came away especially pleased
with it, with the enthusiastic assurances
Commander and Consul Booth-Tucker, Whose Visit to the Coast Has Given a New Impulse to Salvation
Army Affairs.
[From sketcha made by a "Call" artist.]
of support from them. The consul was in
better form than at any other time since
cominp to the coast, while the commander
was at his very best.
A number of promotions among the field
and staff oilicers were announced and each
was greeted with volley after volley of hal
lelujahs. The promotions were as follows:
Staff Captain William Mclntyre to be major.
Adjutant Sam Wood to be staff captain.
KnsiÃii J. K. McFee to be adjutuiu.
â¢ Hj.iii.iti Bill Day to be <-iibign.
Captain W. C. Bourn to b>- ensign.
Captain William Campbell to bi" **nsign.
Captain Charles Taylor to be ensign.
Captain Manhart to be eusigu.
Captain May Sprague to be ensign.
Captain May Dreis to be ensign, i
George S. Montgomery to be captain.'
Lieutenant May Ncuman to be captain.
Lieutenant Minnie W ise to be captain.
These are the first promotions made in
the army in the United States since the
BoottÂ»-Tuckers took command. A great
number of promotions will be made all
along the line, but it so happens circum
stances have been such that these on the
Pacilic Coast are the first to be made.
Staff Captain Mclntyre is, or has been,
Brigadier K.eppel'a secretary and right
hand man.
Ensign McFee has been in charge of the
social wine of the army, under Mrs. Kep
pel. for seveial years. His wife advances
with him in the rank. It ib not at all likely
that promotion from ensign to adjutant
means a shifting of the field of labor, al
though change is the order of the army.
The meeting with the officers was held
at !i:.;0 o'clock in the morning and later
Commander Booth-Tucker visited the
oflice of Mayor Sutro and in the absence of
the Mayor had a long talk with his secre
tary, Taylor Rogers, concerning a plan for
the prosecution of the farming scheme
which the army has had in mind for a long
time.
It is proposed to secure a large tract of
land upon which men otherwise unable to
secure employment may be put to work to
earn their living, tools as well as the land
being provided. This is the first step in
this direction in this country, and it is
proposed that it be followed by ttie other
steps that have already been taken in
Eng<and â that of establishing workshops
of various kinds in the City for the unem
ployed.
Previous to his departure last evening
Commander Booth said : "I have been
well repaid tor my visit here, although my
coming was brought by the sickness of
my wife. The enthusiasm that I find
among the officers and soldiers of the
coast is gratifying to the last degree. We
are overwhelmed wiih applications for
commissions â young men acd women
eager to commit their Jives to the prosecu
tion of the work. Instead of a great
breach and setback I think we are to wit
ness an era of great progress in the army.
"Is there any indication of Ballington
Booth's returning to his allegiance? I
cannot say as to that. Certainly the
pleading of his father must affect him.
But he seems to be going on with his
work, and we are certainly going on with
ours. We shall go ahead as though
nothing had happened so far as tne prose
cution of the work is concerned, although,
never ceasing to pray for the return of
those who have strayed."
The consul talked much in the same
strain, expressing great gratification with
the condition of the army as she found it,
and regretting that I.er health had not
permitted her to see more.
A FACTORY GIRL TALKS.
Declares That Working for a Chinese
Firm Is Preferable to Employment
in a White Factory-
One of the girls employed in the blouse
waist factory of the Chinese firm of Hue
Kai & Co., 127 Clay street, denies that girls
are paid less than the Chinese formerly at
work there, and who were replaced with
white girls when they struck for increased
pay.
She ascribes the report to the jealousy of
the owners of other factories where white
girls are employed. This is her story:
"Girls working in factories owned by
white men have been almost driven into
despair by the treatment of their em
ployers.
"It is stated that in this Chinese factory
girls make but 75 cents or $1 a day. It
may be true that some new hands make
only that much, but when their week is
ended they don't have to pay back part of
their wages for the steam furnished to
run their machines nor for repairs to old,
worn-out machines, as in some of the
white factories, where girls sometimes
have to pay to learn, and where tliey are
charged 50 cents for motor power and 5
cents for two needles, so that when the
week is up the work of new hands is
virtually done for nothing for some time.
No such practice prevails in this Chinese
factory, and whatever work a girl turns
out she is paid for, and no one begrudges
her what she gets.
"It is not true, either, that Chinese keep
tally of the girls' work, for no Chinese are
allowed to mix with the white girls. As
for the Chinese bosses themselves they
might serve as examples to the white em
ployers, for they always act in a perfectly
gentlemanly way toward the girls, which
is more than one can say of the white em
ployers, who seldom show even respect
for the giris whom they employ.
"But to return to the question of wages:
girls in the Chinese factory make from $5
to fl2 a week, according to how industri
ous and expert they are. Nor is it true
that we are annoyed by the striking
Chinamen."
PIONEER WILLIAM'S DEATH.
Buitt Knrly Ferry- Koata Â»nd Steamers
fur the Southern Pacific.
Benjamin Franklin Williams, the pio
neer Ehipbuilder of the Southern Pacific
Company, died at his home, 226 Michigan
street, Potrero, last night.
B. F. Williams entered the service of
the company many years ago, and con
structed most of the ferry-boats and many
of the steamers running up the river.
Nearly all of this work was done at the
slips in West Oakland. Some years ago
he moved to this City, but the greatest
number of his friends are in Oakland.
The deceased was a native of Wilkes
barre, Pa., 67 years of age. He leaves a
widow and one son, F. D. Williams. He
j will be buried to-day.
AMONG THE LABOR UNIONS
Trades Council to Again Protest
Against the Funding
Bill.
The Ameiican Federation of Labor
Takes a Slap at the Politi
cal Alliance.
Several interesting matters were con
sidered last evening at a meeting of the
San Francisco Labor Council. A letter was
received from Samuel Gompers, president
of the American Federation of Labor,
which read:
We desire to inform you and your organiza
tion that the dues of the central labor unions
and of the State Federation have been reduced
to $10 each per year, payable quarterly, in
stead of $25. as formerly; and if such bodies
have a representation in the annual conven
tion of tlie American Federation of l.ubor an
additional $10 each shall be paid. This law
takes efft-ct May 1, and we would request that
all dues owed up to that date be promptly
jiaiii, so that there will be no confusion. We
nope by this reduction we will be able to
bring together a larger number of central
bodies and thus add to the power ot or
ganized labor throughout the country. â¢ * â¢
It was decided to pay the annual dues â
$20â to the American Federation of Labor.
Jn another letter from Gompera it waa
stated that at trie New York convention of
the American Federation of Labor it was
voted to make special efforts to organize
the journeymen barbers throughout the
country, and the writer asked that co
operative efforts be made in the same di
rection In San Francisco.
Chairman Burns stated that it would be
out of the question in this City with the
present barbers' unions, in which nearly
all of the bosses were members, which was
prohibited in the National federation laws.
In another letter from tne same source it
was stated : "We congratulate you on so
successfully meeting the attempt to sup
plant your body and destroy the labor
movement of your City." This was a slap
at the Trades and Labor Alliance, which
attempted to affiliate with the council and
draw organized labor into politics.
Reports from the unions show that iron
work is dull. Only about half of the
Theatrical Employes' Union members are
at work.
The delegate from the Typographical
Union reported that in consequence of the
large number of typesetting machines the
number of unemployed printers is increas
ing. The printers will soon start an even
ing newspaper in the interest of labor.
The Sailors' Union delegate reported
trade temDorarily dull, as the ship-owners
were waiting for a raise in freights.
Delegate Hober called attention to the
fact that a wholesale hardware house was
about to get a large catalogue of tin
wares, and propose to get the work done !
by the Pacific Press, a non-union printing I
office in Oakland. It was decided toappoint
acommittee from the council and a commit
tee from the Typographical Union to ask
the firm to give the work to a union firm.
J. Flannigan of Anaconda, a member of
the Montana Trade and Labor Council,
was introduced, and expressed great sur
prise that there were not more delegates
present. He said that in Montana the
working-card was a success in all trades.
! Even storecle^rks belonged to unions and
were compelled to have their union cards.
Journeymen maintained the best of wages,
and trades-unionism was a success. In
several instances the unions have had
hard tights, but all were successful, as all
the men stood together.
The secretary was instructed to draw up
suitable resolutions protesting against the
passage of the funding bill to be presented
at the next meeting for indorsement by
the council. The resolution, the second
from the Council, will be forwarded to the
Pacific Coast representatives at Washing
ton.

TALBOT CLIFTON'S
HORSES ATTACHED,
The Sheriff in Possession
of Some Blooded
Equines.
MY LORD FAILED TO PAY
A Judgment Taken by Default
Leads to a Stern Legal
Process.
HIS PROMISE WAS HIS BOND.
A Visit to a Sporting House Gels the
Noble Scion Into a Legal
Tacgle.
Talbot Cliftonâ his lordship with $60,
-000 a year and an appetite for horseraces
and other thingsâ has fallen afoul of the
law again, and as a result four blooded
horsesâ the remnant of his once extensive
stableâ are in the hands of Sheriff Whelan
and will remain there until a little ac-
count that Collector Raver holds against
my lord is settled.
One night several months ago, during
one of his fits of jovial hilarity, Talbot
and a coterie of boon companions wan
dered up Mason street to a sporting re
sort in the 100 block in search of rest and
recreation. They apparently found it, and
all at Talbot's expense, for when morning
dawned and a string of cabs bore the party
to its lodgings the scion of nobility bad
piled up a bill of $142.
Talbot had been out with "White Hat"
McCarthy and some other horsemen dur
ing the previous evening wining and din
ing, and his purse bting somewhat de
pleted he was compelled to tell the man
ager of the house that he would pay
later. Generally with bloods of Clifton's
caliber "later" means the next night or a
week at the outside, and his word was his
bond, as in fact it always is, if he desires it
in the tenderloin. However, Talbot's in
terpretation of "later" is sometimes sev
eral months, and so it was in this case.
His creditor waited patiently and
sent one or two polite notes, but the
coin came not, and at last in despair
sent for the collector of debts sometimes
characterized in inventories as "nominal,"
and requested him to procure the long
sought money. His effort to brine Clif
ton "to the center" by means of notes and
personal calls was no more successful than
the manager's had been, and as a last re
sort suit was brought in the Justices'
Court.
Clifton did not answer the complaint,
for he seldom pays any attention to such
trifles, and Raver obtained a judgment by
default.
Even when notified that an execution
would be taken out on the judgment
unless the amount was paid his lordship
paid no attention and after waiting a
reasonable time Raver decided to attach
the horses, it being deemed probable that
Clilton would rather produce the coin to
release them than any of his otherworldly
goods.
A Deputy Sheriff called at tne Golden
Gate stables yesterday with the necessary
papers and took possession of Kitty L,
Maud, an unnamed mare and the bay
stallion Santa Claus.
