UNITED WITH A
SIMPLE SERVICE
Ex-President Harrison and
Mrs. Dimmick Wedded
at Gotham.
THIRTY-SIX WITNESSES.
But the Guests at St. Thomas'
Church Do Not Include the
General's Children.
IMPRESSIVE CEREMONIES HELD
The Nuptial Supper Taken on the
Train While Speeding to
Indianapolis.
NEW YORK. N. V., April O.â A simple
service united Benjamin Harrison, twenty
third President of the United Suites, and
Mrs. Mary Scott Lord Dimmiek in wed
lock's bond in St. Thomas' Church a half
hour before <> this evening. Not one of
the thirty-six favored witnesses of the cer
emony could fail to have been impressed
with its singular anpretentinusness. Ben
jamin Harrison is a plain man, Mrs. I>im
nii<k is a plain woman. It was fitting,
therefore, that in celebrating such au im
portant epoch it shodld, be characterized
that every-day simplicity of their
lives.
The crowds outside the church showed
the interest the public had in the affair.
Eecrecy U to the actual hour of the cere
mony had been carefully maintained, and
this in a measure kept away the curious.
Then, too, the wea'her was not inviting
enough to attract as great a crowd as was
â¢
Iter sunshine had given way tojdark
and ominous clouds. The morning was
ushered in with a heavy snowstorm, which
later turned into rain. There was a cessa
tion about noon, but the day continued
cloudy and threatening. The crowds
about the church were not of the
city's fashionables. The workday
people were there in force, and
they elbowed each other in their earnest
endeavor to catch a glimpse of the bride
and groom and the different statesmen
who had the honor to l>e included m the
â nail coterie. The guests arrived shortly
after 5. â As they entered they were re
ceived by two ushers, the youthful-looking
private secretary of the ex-President, K.
F. Tibbett, and the, soldierly bearing Dan
iel N. Ransdell, a hero of the Civil War.
The ashen wore frock coatÂ«, dark trousers,
bouttonieres of white violets and white
gloves.
Mr?. John F. Parker, the bride's sister,
occupied a front pew on the left and Mr.
and Mrs. i'inchot the one on the right.
Behind Mrs. Parker sat Governor Morton
and Colonel Marvin, his military piivate
secretary. In the succeeding pews were:
Senator and Mrs. S. B. Elkins, ex-Secre
tary of State John W. Foster and Mrs.
Foster, ex- Attorney General W. H. 11.
Miller and Mrs. Miller and George W.
Boyd of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In
pews back of Mr. and Mrs. Pinchot sat
relatives and friends of the bride. They
were Major and Mrs. Richard Parker,
Chancellor and Mrs. McGill, the Misses
Dimmick and Mrs. Birdge, Mr. and Mrs.
Leeds, Norman Leeds and the Misses
Leeds, Mr. and Mrs. Broughton and Miss
Lambert, General and Mrs. Fitz John Por
ter and the Misses Porter.
[n aii thirty-six people were present.
Admission was by card, written and signed
by Mr. Tibbett, and etch arrival at the
church was closely scrutinized l>y him be
fore being seated. All the tiring xnerubers
of Harrison's Cabinet were present, except
Ex-Pr*sideut Hcnjaniin Harrison and His Bride (formerly Mrs. Mary Lord Dimmick), Who Were Married in New York Yesterday.
The San Francisco Call.
ing Postmaster-General Wanamaker, ex-
Secretary of the Treasury Foster, ex-
Secretary of War Redfield Proctor and ex-
Secretary of the Interior John W. Noble,
all of whom were unavoidably prevented
from witnessing the ceremony.
The gathering of the selected few was
without incident. Governor Morton ar
rived atOii-'O. Mr. and Mrs. Pmchot, who
were the last to enter, arrived on the 5:30
o'clock train. With two or three excep
tions the costumes of the women were
subdued in color, only an occasional gay
Easter bonnet lending life to the scene.
There was no rustling of silken skirts; no
lium and buzz ot voices characteristic of
the usual distinguished metropolitan
church wedding.
Professor W. H. "Warren, the organist,
rendered a few preliminary selections from
the great masters. Still the scene seemed
cold and almost gloomy. One could
hardly realize that a wedding of National
importance was to bo solemiMzed.
It was 5 o'clock when General Harrison
and Benjamin P. Tracy, his best man, en
tered a carriage at the Fifth-avenue Hotel
and started for the church, where they ar
rived at 5:30. They entered through the rec
tor's residenceon Fifty-third street and went
directly to the vestry, where they awaited
the arrival of the bride. General Har
rison wore a long frockcoat, dark trousers
and white gloves. In the lapel of his coat
was a bouttonuiere of lillies of the valley.
General Tracey wore a frockcoat and
striped trousers and a small bouquet of
white violets.
At 5:05 o'clock Mrs. Dim mice and her
brother-in-law, Lieutenant John P. Parker,
I. 8. N., were driven from their residence,
40 East Thirty-eighth street, and reached
thechurchat 5:20 o'clock. They entered
by the main door on Fifth avenue and
went direct to the lower room to the left of
the.vestibule, where their wraps were dis
carded. It was 5:32 when the two large
doors leading to the center aisle were
thrown aside and the ushers, side by side,
stood in the passageway. At the same
moment Dr. J. Wesley Brown, the
Officiating clergyman, robed in a white
cassock, appeared from the vestry, followed
by the rector. Rev. Dr. Brown passed in
behind the sanctuary rail, the attendant
closing the gates after him.
i>r. Brown knelt in prayer a few mo
ments and the refrains of "Lohengrin"
echoed in the empty room. Then the
door leading to the vestry on the left of
the altar opened and the silvery locKs of
Generals Harrison ana Tracy were seen.
There was an awkward pause for a minute
and the assemblage looked inquiringly
lirst at the altar and then at the rear en
trance. Finally at 5:.53 the bride appeared
and fell in behind the ushers. At the
same moment the minister nodded his
head, signalling the groom to step for
ward.
General Harrison and his best man also
came forward and stood upon the top
chancel step. The left hand of the gene
ral was bared and he carried in his right
the left hand glove. Immediately the
bridal procession was begun. The two
ushers walked well forward and took a
position on the second chancel step. The
bride, leaning on the arm of Lieutenant
Parker, followed. Mrs. Dirnmick carried
a handsome white silken j prayer-book,
with an embossed polden. cross on the
cover. "-..' h; Â I
As the party appoached the chancel
General Harrison came down the steps
to the floor to receive his bride. With a
gracious movement she extended her right
hand, which the groom clasped in his left.
Then the couple ascended the steps to the
center of the altar, where they knelt in
prayer. General Tracey and Lieutenant
Parker followed, the former standing to
the right of the groom and the lieutenant
to the left of the bride. It was a pretty
picture, beautiful in its simplicity. The
reading of the Protestant Episcopal
service was begun. Both faced the minis
ter and listened intently to his words.
When the usual question was propounded
to the groom ; "Wilt thou have this woman
to be thy wedded wife?" etc., the general
responded in a subdued, almost inaudible
tone. When the same question was put to
the bride she answered in a clear, musical
voice.
In response to the question, "Who
giveta this woman to l>e married to this
man?" Lieutenant Parker stepped for
ward. Taking the bride's right hand he
plat --I it in the general's left. The minis
ter smiled pleasantly, gently removed Mrs.
Dimmick's hand from the clasp of the
general and motioned the lieutenant to
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, APRIL 7, 1896.
The New Bully and the Oldâ Boss Rainey : "Don' you trifle with my gal."
I place it in his (the minister's). Mr. Par
ker complied, and then the groom made
the usual promise that "I plight thee my
troth," the bride in turn making the same
vow. Tho minister at the same time
joined both their hands. As the minister
uttered the words, "Those whom God hath
j joined together let no man put asunder,"
the bride and groom turned about and
faced each other. General Harrison stood
j erect, with his left hand behind his back
i and his unused glove dangling between
! his fingers.
The final words that made them one
were pTonounced at seventeen minutes to
l 6 o'clock. Dr. Brown shook hands with
| both and offered his warm congratula-
I tions. The ex-President then extended
his right arm to his newly made bride,
and to the s>offc strains of the "Tann
hauser" wedding march they filed down
the center aisle. They were immediately
followed by the ushers. Next came Lieu
tenant Parker. As he reached his pew he
gave his arm to Mrs. Parker, who stood
, awaiting him. General Tracy followed,
! he taking Mrs. Pinchot from the pew on
' the right. In this order the wedding pro
cession marched down the aisle, the guests
! following behind. On reaching the vesti-
I bule thr party returned to the tower-room,
! where wraps were donned. The party at
! once left the church and retired to their
carriages.
During the ceremony the intermezzo
from Mascagni's "Cavallerla Rusticana"
was rendered on the organ with artistic
effect. The moment the bridal party en
tered the assemblage rose, and remained
standing throughout the ceremor.y. The
deepest interest was manifested, and
every movement of the contracting couple
was noted. As the bride and groom
marched down the aisle after the cere
mony Mrs. Harrison bowed pleasantly to
her different acquaintances. The stern
expression depicted upon her usually
pallid face had faded away, and was sup
planted by a bright smile. The general's
face bore a calm, satisfied expression.
The bridal party was driven to the resi
dence of Mrs. Pinchot, 2 Gramercy Park,
where light refreshments were served.
Here the bride and groom donned their
traveling attire. Soon after 7 o'clock the
party re-entered their carriages and were
taken to the railroad station in Jersey
City. They boarded the private car of
Vice-President Frank Thompson, which
was coupled to the regular 7:50 r. m. train
west, and the bride and groom left for

, reached this city of a fiprht that occurred
j among the hills around Ran Bias, near
I Cienfuegos, province of Santa Clara, be
| tween the column commanded by Colonel
Vasquez and a body of insurgents. The
latter occupied an elevated position,
! which gave them a decided advantage
over the Spaniards, who were taken by
surprise. The troops claim that the rebels
used explosive bullets. However this
may be, it is known that the Spanish were
defeated after a hot light, losing many
| killed ana wounded. Among the latter
1 were Colonel Vasquez and Lieutenant
Buron. At one time during the engace
, ment the insurgents charged upon the
| troops with machetes, inflicting heavy
| losses.
The official account of the fight says the
insurgents lost twenty-one killed and
three wounded, while the Pjianish loss
was sixteen wounded. The report says
the insurgents were defeated, but like
many otter of the reports issued by the
Government it is utterly unreliable. The
insurgents, na stated, completely surprised
the troops and utterly routed them. The
newspapers here report that Gomez with
4(X)0 men is going to the Siguanez Valley.
A court-martial held at Matanzas has
sentenced four prisoners of war to death.
They are Timato Mesa, Jose Gonzales, Ra
mon Gonzales and Salustiano Fresneda.
Twenty-four prisoners were to-day de-
ported to the Isle of Pines. Ten of them
were convicted of political offenses, while
the others were ordinary criminals.

CONFIXED JA" MOKRO CASTLE.
Many Political Vriaone.rn and Suspect*
Awaiting Trial.
HAVANA, Cuba, ApriJ 4 (via Tampa,
Fla., April 6).â Two hundred and twelve
men are confined in two cells of Morro
Cagtle. They are political prisoners or
suspects, awaiting trial. Some have been
there a week, some a month, some a year.
Two are Americans. One is a British
subject. There is a boy of 14 years, born
in Spain and not long enough in this
country to dream of rebelling against the
Government. There are men bowed in
years, younc men, merchants, professional
men, clerks and farm laborer", all gathered
in and thrown together without much evi
dence of their having aided or taken part
in the insurrection. In the Cabanas fort
ress close by and prisons all over the
island are other unfortunate?. In times
of war foreigners, newspaper corresDond
ents and tourists are supposed to
bÂ« !Â«hnt out. of Spanis'.: prisons,
but relatives and friends are ad
mitted to Morro Castle on Sundays and
Mondays. Each cell is about twenty feet
wide and 100 feet deop. They are of stone
ceiled above, and more like subterranean
tunnels than abodes for human beings.
They are damp and filthy and infested
with worms. Nothing in the shape of
chairs, benches or beds i* i>rovided. There
are, however, hooks foi -â¢â¢ ./ hammocks,
but as there are 108 men in one room and
104 In the other, over half the number are
compelled to sleep on the stone floors.
Water is furnished twice a day in square
cans, which once contained kerosene oil.
Regular army rations are served. The
sanitary arrangements are vile.
One of the prisoners is Lopez Coloma.
In the early days of the rebellion, like
Juan Gulberto Gomez, who died in Ceuta
prison, Coloma presented himself when
Captain-General Callija issued his procla
mation granting amnesty to all insurgents
who surrendered. He has been in prison
over a year, has neither been deported nor
given a trial, and stands a good chance of
dying in prison. Another of the prisoners
is La Dislao Quintero, an American citizen
of the peaceful precincts of Guatao, who
was taken prisoner in his own house
and shot in the arm after capture.
He never took part in the insurrection.
Another prisoner is Manuel Francisco
Aguero. He claims to be an American
citizen, and, although he was arrested in
July, 1895, the American Consul said he
had never heard of the case. Aguero is a
general manager of a circus and nearly <X)
years of age. He speaks English and says
he is a citizen of the United States. He
says he has taken no part in the war, and
was arrested in Guarara, Havana province,
July 13 of last year.
Consul Williams has agreed +o inquire
into his case. There is a British subject
in Morro who has been there about four
months, but as ho is informed that he will
be released inside of a week he does not
desire his name mentioned. Nearly all of
the 212 are white. One is a smooth
cheeked Spanish lad of 14, who was a clerk
in a store in a small town in the interior
of Havana province. He left the position
and was walking along the road to Havana
when arrested, charged with being a rebel.
In the casements of Morro are other
political prisoners, besides the 212, and in
Cabanas, Sanguilla, the only American
who has had a trial, is still confined.
Cepero, an American who has been in
Cabanas two months, is now at the Pre
sidios Prison, Havana. He will be taken
to .Santa Clara for trial. The two Somil
lans, father aW son, have been released,
after about six weeks in prison, there being
no evidence against them. They are
Americans and are well known in the
tobacco trade.
JiELLIGEREJSCT IS URGED.
Adoption by the House of the Concurrent
Cuban Resolution*.
WASHINGTON D. C, April 6.âAccord
ing to the arrangement made Saturday,
the House to-day voted on the report of
the conference committee recommending
the adoption of the Senate resolutions re
garding Cuba, instead of those recently
passed by the House. They were agreed
t0â 245 to 27. The affirmative vote would
have been ten or twelve greater, but the
several gentlemen who had general pairs
with absent members did not feel at lib
erty to vote, although it was stated that
the absentees were themselves in favor of
the resolutions. Several members lost
their votes by being out of the House when
the roll was called.
The text of the resolutions follow:
Resolved, That iD the opinion of Congress a
condition of public war exists between the
Government of Spain and the government pro
claimed and for some time maintained by
force of arms by the people of Cuba, and that
the United States of America should maintain
a strict neutrality between the contending
powers, according to each all the rights of
belligerents in the ports and territory of the
United Stutes.
Resolved, further. That the friendly offices of
the United States should be offered by the
President to the Spanish Government for the
recognition of the independence of Cuba.
These are the Senate resolutions con
curred in by the House.
Hitt (R.j of Illinois, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, demanded
the regular order â the vote on the ques
tion of agreeing to the report of the com
mittee on conference recommending the
adoption of the Senate resolutions regard
ing Cuba instead of those primarily
adopted by the House. On that Tucker
(D.) of Virginia demanded the ayes and
noes and they were ordered.
The result was announced: Ayes 245,
noes 27 â so the report of the Conference
Committee was agreed to. The galleries

Dispatches from Madrid stating that it
is expected in official circles there that
President Cleveland will sign the Cuban
belligerent resolutions, but will postpone
givincthem effect by a proclamation, indi
cate that the nature of the resolutions is
not even yet understood at the Snanish
capital. As repeatedly explained, they
are "concurrent resolutions," not "joint
resolutions," and under a practice which
has grown up in recent years in Congress,
concurrent resolutions do not require ap
proval or disapproval by the President,
who may act upon them or not, as he
chooses, but in no case is he called upon
to sign them. Similar resolutions adopted
by Congress in connection with Armenian
affairs, January '20 last, remain unacted
upon by the President.

MADRID, Spain, April 6.â The news

adoption by the American Congress of the
resolutions recognizing the belligerency
of the Cuban insurgents, and the com
ments are very bellicose. They support
the proposal that has been made to raise a
national subscription for a volunteer fleet.
The Heraldo declares that the Spaniards
except Senor de Lome, Spanish Minister
at Washington, believe that Cleveland
will not r ecoenize the Cubans as bel
ligerents. It adds that if the United
States means war with Spain tne latter
would prefer it to humiliation.

BANDIT HAINES
HAS CONFESSED
Dan McCall's Accomplice
Exposes the Visalia
Plotters.
DESERTED HIS FRIEIT&.
He Was to Have Assisted in the
Attempted Train Hold-Up,
but Weakened.
BRITT'S STORY CORROBORATED
Lovren and Ardell Declared to Have
Been at the Head of the
Ro'jD2r Clique.
VISALIA, Cat,., April fi.â John Haines,
the accomplice of Outlaw Dan McCall, Si
Lovren and Charles Ardell in the at
tempted robbery of the Southern Pacific
overland train near Tulnre three weeks
ago, has confessed. For several days
Sheriff Merritt and his subordinates have
held the secret of the conspirators, and
the evidence against the men who planned
the raid, ending in the killing of McCall
and the wounding of Officers Daggett and
Heed, is complete. The officials had not
given the confession publicity for reasons
of their own, and it w:is not until a Salva
tion Army member told the story to-night
that it became, known that Haines had
weakened.
Uaines was a Salvation Army member,
and until a month or six weeks ago was
known as an earnest worker for the cause.
About that time he became intimate with
Lovren and Ardell, the proprietors of the
Deadfall saloon, who are now in ]&'A on a
charge of having planned the attempted
hold-up and supplied arms, ammunition
and masks. Haines became a ready tool
and he was to have accompanied McCall
on the trip which ended in the outlaw's
death ; but at the last minute, after Hainen
had supplied McCall with giant powder
with which to blow up the safe in the ex
press-car, he deserted McCall. He now
gives as the reason for having weakened
that he feared treachery on the part of
Lovren and Ardell and wanted nothing
more to do with them.
Haines' confession rorroborates the
story o^Me Britt, who betrayed the plot
to tht M, Â»ori*ies. In an interview with
a Call Correspondent, held two days after
the tragedy at Tagus, Britt said:
"About two weeks ago he (McCall) told
me that everything was arranged; that
Lovren and had everything com
pleted and the prospect for a rich job was
in sight. McCall, Haines and myself
never conversed on the subject at the
same time. Sometimes McCall and Haines
would talk over the scheme. Haines and
myself often talked about it, but not as
much as Dan and me. I never spoke to
Lovren and Ardell and to no other person
but Haines and McCall. I understood that
the men in town would watch the move
ment of the Sheriff's men.
"On last Tuesday afternoonâ the day
before the robbery â Dan drove over to
Haines' place to talk with Haines and see
if he was still in the mood to stand in on
the proposed robbery. On his return he
seemed to be put out. and said they did
not have an opportunity to talk. It was
not long before Haines drove up to our
cabin with giant powder. McCall and he
had a long talk. After Haines' departure
Dan told me that Haines would be on
hand.
"That night Dan went to town and
brought out the shotgun with him. Wed
nesday noon the 'two six-shooters were
brought out. Between 7 ana Bon the even
ing of the attempted hold-up, some one
brought out the rifle. Dan met them in
the field near the gate. Dan was over
joyed at the news he had heard â just
laughed and danced around. Then he be
came impatient and concluded that Haines
would never come."
According to Britt, McCall waited as long
as possible for Haines and then left in
company with Britt to board the overland.
Britt deserted him at Tulare, and McCall,
left alone, but undaunted, attempted to
carry out the programme arranged by the
conspirators.
Captain Jennie Barnhart of the Salra
tion Array corps here is satisfied at last
that Haines is guilty. She and her soldiers
refused to believe him guilty at first.
Haines joined the army here about the
second week in January and was sworn in
on February 6. For nearly a month ho
remained faithful and attended regularly,
though he lived about eight miles in the
country. Then he changed in his actions.
He seldom came to the meetings and his
heart was not in the services. On the Sun
day before the attempted robbery Haines,
his wife and eldest daughter took part in
the army street march and the services in
the barracks. On the very night of tne at
tempted robbery he hitched up and drove
over to Tulare, a distance .of nearly twenty
miles, to attend a Salvation Army jubilee
in that town.

OFFICIAL DUTIES NEGLECTED.
Allen Says the Greatest Mugwump of
the Country Is Installed at
the White House.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 6.-The
proposition in the postoffice appropriation
bill affecting the consolidation of small
postofficea near the large towns and cities
led to a long debate in the Senate to-day
in which there was an exhibition of much
political and personal feeling. While the
present administration of the Postoffice
Department received commendation from
a Republican Senator (Wolcott of Colo
rado), it received severe criticism from a
Democratic Senator (Gorman of Mary
land), and President Cleveland came in
for a large measure of abuse from a Popu
list Senator (Allen of Nebraska). Accord
ing to Wolcott, the affairs of the Postoffice
are being "ably and intelligently con
ducted."
Gorman ironically congratulated the
Po6tosHce Department that it had a Re
publican Senator for a defender, and he
suggested with biting sarcasm that many
acts of the administration could best be
defended by some Republicans. He con
demned Postmaster-General Wilson for
going about the country delivering lec
tures on the tariff and on gold and silver,
instead of attending to the duties of his
office, and quoted the homely proverb
that when a man is found proclaiming
his own virtue and honesty there is a ras
cal near at hand.
Allen was even less reserved in the ex
pression of his views. The greatest mug
wump in the country, he said, was in
stalled in the White House, although he
thought it was difficult to tell whether Mr.
Cleveland was more of a mugwump than
he was of an imperial Democrat. He
added that Mr. Cleveland was a disgrace
to the ereat office he occupied, and that he
ought not to be, and doubtless would not
be, returned to that position again.
Tne session closed without a vote having
been reached, but it was agreed that a vote
Ehould be taken at 5 o'clock to-morrow on
the bills and all pending amendments. A
message announcing the action of the
House on the Cuban resolution was re
ceived, but no further action on thgpart of
the Senate was necessary. â ,
Among the bills reported and p"ced on
the calendar was one from the Committee
on Territories, by Davis of Minnesota,
making one year's residence a pre-requis
ite for divorce in the Territories.
A bill was introduced by Frye(R.)of
Maine and referred, giving a pension of
$100 a month to the widow of the late
General Thomas D. Casey (retired).
Aliison (R.) of lowa moved to proceed
to the consideration of the postoffice bill,
declinine to yield to the request of Call of
Florida that his joint resolution in refer
ence to Cuba might be taken up. Call
thereupon announced that he would to
morrow move to take it up, as the Senator
from Indiana (Turpie) desired to speak
upon it.
The postoffice appropriation bill was
then taken up. the question being on
Wolcott's amendment as to the compen
sation of clerks in the stations and sub
stations.
Wolcott spoke at length in favor of his
amendment in which civil service reform
is involved. The theory of the amend
ment was to have a better mail service at
less cost; and that theory, he was proud
to say, was the one upon which the Post
office Department was being conducted.
The object of the movement was to re
move the service from politics. He ad
mitted that the appreciation of civil
service reform was an acquired taste, but
once acquired it was never lost.
Gorman in the course of some remarks
on the subject said that if this were a po
litical question he congratulated the Post
office Department that it has for its de
fender one of the most distinguished Sen
ators. "There has been a suspicion," he
said, "among a great number of Demo
crats that many acts of this administra
tian could best be defended by some Re
publican; and I am delighted that the
Senator from Colorado has come out as
the champion of a department which is
departing from the usage and, as I think,
from the law."
In the course of some further remarks
Gorman criticized severely the Postmas
ter-General for neglecting the duties of
his office in order to go about delivering
lectures ell over the country on the tariff
situation, on silver and gold, and he
quoted the homely saying that where a
man is found proclaiming hiÃ virtue and
Ins lionesty there is a rascal near at hand.
He trusted that Congress would not give
its sanction to the beginning of a system
of consolidation of the groat powers of the
Postmaster- General.
Hill (D.) of New York also suggested
some modificptions. and said he was with
the Senator from Colorado on the general
proposition of including the small post
offices within the limits of a city or in its
immediate outskirts. But if the scheme
Â«as one to overturn the system which had
existed for years it should be done in some
other way than by an amendment to an
appropriation bill. He thought the sys
tem should be restricted to postoflices
within five miles of large cities.
Pasco (l>.) of Florida suggested an
amendment that nothing in the bill should
authorize the establishment of any branch
stations beyond the limits of the city or
town in which the principal office is lo
cated.
Nelson (R.) of Minnesota opposed the
consolidation scheme, which he likened to
the system of the great department stores
â "the devilfish of modern society."
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska took part in
the debate and in the course of his remarks
fiaid: "The greatest mugwump in the
country to-day is installed in the White
House. It is very difficult to tell whether
Mr. Cleveland is more of a mugwump
than he is of an imperial Democrat. But
certainly he has led the hosts of mug
wumps in the country for the last ten or
fifteen years. And Mr. Roosevelt, that
New York mugwump, is second only to
Cleveland himself."
Allen commented on the dismissal of
George D. Johnson from his office as Civil
Service Commissioner and denounced
Cleveland's course in the matter, saving
that the President had wanted to "dicker"
with Mr. Johnson by offering him the con
sulate at Victoria. The spirit of civil ser
vice reform, he said, had run wild. It had
gone to the very verge of idiocy. There
was no difference between Cleveland De
mocracy and goldbug Republicanism.
Allen revived some of the election stories
of 1892, how Wall-street men raised
$300,000 towards the nomination of Mr.
Cleveland and afterward raised a lise sum
for the election of Mr. Harrison.
Gray (D.) of Delaware asked how much
had been raised for the election of Mc-
Kinley.
Allen replied that he had not read the
latest evidence about McKinley. He men
tioned the case of Mr. Vnn Alen, who, he
said, had contributed $50,000 toward the
election of Mr. Cleveland and had been re
warded by an appointment as Minister to
Italy. He also spoke of "the great and
good Wanamaker, Superintendent of Sun
day-scbool3," who had given $400,000 for
the eleotion of Mr. Harrison and had been
rewarded with the postmaster-general-
ship.
The Presidential office was set upon the
auction block and sold to the men who
would pay the most for it. But when it
came to a fourth-class postoffice civil
service reform had to be insisted upon.
Hawley (R.) of Connecticut said he took
it for granted that neither the Senator
from Nebraska nor any other man in the
world supposed that John Wanamaker
gave $400,000 to make Mr. Harrison Presi
dent, and he did not believe that any
Democratic Senator supposed that Mr.
Harrison nad gone into any such contract.
White (D.) of California opposed the
postoffice consolidating as "a great post
office trust, which would lead to a great
deal of trouble."
After further debate it was arranged
that the vote should be had at 5 o'clock
to-morrow.
The House bill granting a pension of
$100 a month to John M. Thayer was
passed; also giving a pension of $"i 0 a
month to the widow of Charles A. Hick
man; also a bill to provide for the contin
uance in office of customs officers and as
sistant treasurers until their successors
shall have been qualified.
A message was received from the House
announcing the passing by that body of
the concurrent resolutions on Cuba, and
at the same time Sherman (R.) of Ohio re
ported that the conference committee had
agreed upon these Benate resolutions,
remarking that no further action was nec
essary at present.
The Senate at 5:30 adjourned.
POLITICS OF THE NATION
Victory for Republicans in the
Municipal Elections of
Ohio.
McKinley and Bradley Running a
Close Race for Delegates
in Kentucky.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, April 6.â Township
and mun icipal elections were held through
out Ohio to-day in nearly all the cities and
townships of the State. The election seems
to have been quiet, with a light vote ex
cept in smaller municipalities, where local
issues made the contests cloÂ«3 and hard
fought. Returns indicate a general Re
publican victory.
DETROIT. Mich., April 6.â Elections
were held throughout Michigan to-day.
Unusual interest was manifested in the
elections, and a very large vote was polled.
While the issues as a rule were purely
local the Democrats generally developed
unlooked for strength, and in many coun
ties that have gone Republican their ticket
had been elected in part.
DUBUQUE, lowa, April 6.â Mayor Oli
eer (D.) was defeated to-day by Thomas
T. Duffy (D. ), nominated by the citizens
and indorsed by Republicans. Duffy has
apparently reversed the Democratic ma
jority of 15,000, and carried every precinct
in the city.
LEXINGTON, Ky., April 6.â The lar
gest Republican County convention ever
held in Fayette County was the one which
met here to-night. Governor Bradley's
workers were on hand, but the McKinley
leaders outgeneraled them, although the
Bradley men fought for all they were
worth. The convention showed four to
one for McKinley.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 6.â ln Louis
ville and Jefferson counties this afternoon
and until 9 o'clock this evening was
waged the hottest campaign for years.
This contest was between the Bradley
and McKinley members, and every indica
tion pointed to McKinley. The result of
the contests to-day gives Bradley five
counties, with 81 votes, and McKinley five
counties, with 79 votes. Hart Ccunty (15)
was uninstructed.
KNOXVILLE, Tkxn., April 6.â The Re

here last night. It is supposed that Miss
Owen had rejected Dr. Ryder's suit.
Ryder fired a charge from his shotgun at
A. P. Person, with whom she was talking,
but it did not injure him.
After the deed the doctor took an ounce
of morphine and terribly gashed his throat
with a pooketknife in an effort to kill him
self. He was arrested and is now in the
Talbot County Jail. All the parties are

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 7,; 1896.
DEBATED ONLY
FORTY MINUTES.
Passage of the River and
Harbor Bill by the
House.
A LITTLE OPPOSITION.
Dockery and Hepburn Protest
Against Some of the Liberal
Appropriations.
MORTON MORE ACCOMMODATING
Now Willing to Distribute Seed in
Accordance With the Wish of
Congressmen.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 6.-In the
House to-day the river and harbor appro
priation bill was taken up, and after forty
minutes' debate was passed, under suspen
sion of rules, by a vote of 21G to 40.
Hooker (R.) of New York, chairman of
tne committee, managed the measure so
as to secure practically unanimous support
of it, the opposition failing to muster suf
ficient strength to obtain a vote by ayes
and noes. This is said to be the lirst time
in the history of the river and harbor bill
that one has gone through the House with
as little opposition.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa and Dockery (D.)
of Missouri were the chief antagonists,
and Catchings (D.) of Mississippi, Burton
(R.)of Ohio and Hooker (R.) of New York
were the principal advocates of the meas
ure. Catchings said it was the best bill,
the most scientifically constructed, and
would redound more to the benefit ot the
whole country than any similar bill that
nad been presented to the House since he
had been in Congress.
Grosvenor (II.) of Ohio reported the
tilled cheese bill from the Committee ou
Ways and Means and gave notice that he
would call it up on Wednesday.
After the journal had been disposed of
Wadsworth (R.) of New York, chairman
of the Committee on Agriculture, read a
letter from Secretary Morton stating that
in obedience to the almost unanimous con
sent of the House he had arranged with
the contractors to put up garden seeds in
packages of five each instead of fifteen as
at first arranged, making 3,205,000 pack
ages, instead of 625,000, for the use of
members of Congress. The change re
quired an additional expense of $5000.
Hooker (R.) of New York moved that
the House pass under suspension of the
rules the river and harbor appropriation
bill for the year ending June 30, 1597.
Objection was made to disposing with
the readme of the bill and to extending the
debate until 3 o'clock.
Debate was then opened tinder the rules,
twenty minutes on each side, Kurton (R. )
of Ohio advocating the passage of the bill.
Dockery (D.) of Missouri, leading the op
position to the bill, said he was in
favor of just and proper appropriations
for the improvement of rivers and harbors,
but was not in favor of the policy which
compelled the House to appropriate money
for the improvement of unimportant
streams to secure that result. But if he
approved every item in the bill he would
opDOse its passage under suspension of the
rules. The House was entitled to proceed
in tne usual methods with the considera
tion of a bill carrying a direct present ap
propriation of $10,427,500 and a conditional
expenditure of $51,721,211.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa made the princi
pal speech against the bill. He said he
stood on the floor almost alone in one re-
spect. "The bill carries no 'pork' for my
district, but there is enough in it to secure
its passage, and I recognize that nothing
I can Bay will interfere with the stately
march of this appropriation to comple
tion."
Running over the pages of th? bill, he
said he saw that tne State of Maine had
secured $1,565,000, Massachusetts $1,499,(100,
Rhode Island $650,000, New York $4,474,000,
and Delaware $4,970,000. Enough local
interest had been judiciously placed to
secure the passage of the bill. Continu
ing, he 6aid he found that there had been
appropriated to be expended by the Mis
sissippi River Commission the sum of
$625,000 and contracts authorized to the
amount of $8,375,000 additional.
"I have no objection," said Hepburn,
"to the legitimate improvement of our
waterways. lam trying to rebuke, if pos
sible, the methods employed to secure this
immense sum of money. The bill appro
priates for the yreat work of the Hennepin
canal, which would open up a waterway
to the East, the magnificent sum of $25,
--000 and authorizes the continuance of the
work over a period of ten years."
In conclusion Hepburn said he desired
only to speak of the viciousness of the
system summoned by the gentleman from
New York (Hooker) to bring a bill into
the House, carrying obligations to the
amount of $62,000,000, and demand that it
be passed with only forty minutes' debate
and without opportunity to amend it.
Catchings (D.) of Mississippi, chairman
of committee in the last Congress, replied
to Hepburn. "This bill." he said, "is the
best bill, the most scientifically drawn and
will redound to the benefit of the whole
country more than any bill that has passed
the House since I have been in Congress.
[Applause.]
In the course of further debate Clark
quoted the traffic manager of one of the
great Northwestern systems as saying
that the result of the work on the Missis
sippi was a reduction of 50 per cent in
freight rates all over the Mississippi
Valley.
Colson (R. ) of Kentucky said the only
objection he had to the bill was that it
did not carry enough money. The t>eople
of Kentucky believed with Henry Clay
in spending freely for internal improve
ments.
Herrman (R.) of Oregon, said no policy
had been so profitable to the people of the
country as that of making liberal appro
priations for waterways.
Hooker (R.) of New York close d the de
bate in a five-minute speech. As to the
criticism against considering it under sus
pension of the rules, Hooker said that in
the last CongresÃ a bill carrying $25,000,000
had been reported from a committee of
which Dockery was a member and dis
posed of in the same way, and ha made no
objection to that.
Upon the question of suspending the
rules and passing the bill the vote by di
vision stood : Ayes 216, noea 40, and the
announcement by the Speaker waÃ fol
lowed with applause.
An effort to secure a vote by ayes and
noes failed. Hepburn, in leaving the sub
ject, remarked that the "vote showed the
general evenness with which the 'pork'
had been distributed."
Howe (R.) of New York moved to sus
pend the rules and pass the House bill
with Senate amendments, validating cer
tain bonds issued under authority of the
Legislature of New Mexico, but the motion
was lost.
On motion of Hartman (R.) of^lontana,
the rules were suspended and the House
bill was passed for the relief of the settlers
on the abandoned Fort Asslnaboine mili
tary reservation, Montana.
After Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio had re
ported the "filled-cheese" bill the House
at 4 :60 adjourned until to-morrow.
McLACHLAJr ON GIT AH IK
Demands a More Liberal Appropriation
for San Pedro.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 6.â During
the debate on the river and harbor bill
Representative McLachlan of California
managed to crowd the following into his
half-minute speech:
"Mr. Speaker: I am opposed to the
motion of the gentleman from New York
to suspend the rules and pass this bill, for
the reason that if this course is pursued it
will give no opportunity for any one to
offer any amendments to this important
measure making appropriations aggregat
ing over $60,000,000 of the people's money,
including continuous contracts provided
for therein. I assume that the Committee
on Rivers and Harbors has faith in the
justice and merits of the bill that it has
presented here to-day, and, if I am right
in this assumption, that committee can
surely have no valid objection to submit
ting their labors and conclusions to the
deliberate judgment of this House and
give us reasonable opportunity to investi
gate them for ourselves.
"The members of thi3 committee will
not claim to be infallible, or assume that
their judgment upon many features of
this bill is superior to that of the whole
House. This bill is far from being Satis
factory to me or the people whom I repre
sent. San I'edro harbor, the point in my
district where two great transcontinental
railroads touch the tidewater on the Pa
cific Coast, has received most miserly con
sideration at the hands of the committee,
notwithstanding the most reasonable de
mands that we made of it, and I now urge
you to defeat this resolution, to suspend
the rules and pass this bill so that I may
have opportunity to present to the House
the merits of our claim for San Pedro and
Southern California. Having had an op
portunity to do that, I must be satisfied
witb the result. But if this resolution
prevails I will have no opportunity to
present our case to the House, and must
submit to the wrong perpetrated by the
committee against an improvement that
deserves far better consideration than it
has received at the hands of the River and
Harbor Committee. There are other lo
calities that have similar grievances
against the provisions of this bill, and -we
simply demand an opportunity to be
heard."
The fate of Santa Monica and San Pedro
harbors in the Senate is now a matter of
speculation. Both California Senators will
try to have the $392,000 (continuous con
tract) appropriation made for San Pedro,
but if Huntington, through his man Frye,
chairman oi the committee, manages to
get Santa Monica into the bill again it is
considered doubtful whether Senators
White aÂ£j? Perkins will fight the latter
provision if such action would endanger
the San Pedro appropriation, as it did in
the House. Boards of Trade, Chambers of
Commerce and labor organizations are
now wiring McLachlan to work for both
harbors.
MISHAPS ON A MOUNTAIN
Thrilling Accidents Attend the
Opening of a Railroad
in Wales.
An Engine Goes Over a Precipice and
Cars Are Smashed, but Life
Is Not Lost.
LONDON, Enq., April 6.â What might
have proved a more serious accident oc
curred to-day on the railway from Llan
berris at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the
highest mountain in Wales, to the top of
the mountain. The railway waÃ inaugur
ated to-day.
The first train reached the summit with
out mishap, but when returning the engine
jumped the track on a part of the line
where the grade was the steepest. The
engine went over a precipice and was
broken to pieces. As it left the rails the
coupling broke, and it was that alone that
prevented a frightful accident.
The engineer and stoker jumped and es
caped. The cars ran down the grade at a
tremendous speed, but as fortunately they
were supplied with the most powerful
brakes they were checked in their speed
and brought to a standstill.
In the meantime some of the persons
aboard the train lost their heads, and
without heeding the warnings to them,
jumped from the cars. They were all se
verely injured.
From some cause not yet made clear a
spcond train that was descending the
mountain crashed into the rear of the
runaway train and smashed a car into
kindling wood. Just prior to the crash
the occupants of the car had quitted it.
BRUTALITY TO J'BISOXEIIS.
Story of Cruel Treatment Told by a JRe

LONDON, Eng., April 6.â The dyna
miter, McCullugh, who was sentenced for
life in connection with the plot which re
sulted in the destruction of part of the
Tradeston Gas Works in 1883, has been re
leased from Portland Prison, the physi
cians certifying that death would result
shortly if he was longer confined. Mc-
Cullugh states that several of the dyna
miters who were confined in Portland
Prison have become weak-minded. Daly,
he says, is quite gray and utterly broken
down. As an instance of the treatment
accorded him he declares that when he
entered the Pentonville Prison, before he
was taken to Portland, an officer asked
him wbat his sentence was. He replied
that he had been condemned to life im
prisonment. The officer responded, "That
w on't take you long," and kicked him in
the back.

PAYMENT OF THE DEBTS
The Bill Proposes to Extend the

THERE WILL BE OPPOSITION.
Morgan and Maguire to Prepare a
Measure in the Interests of
the People.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 6.â The
joint sub-committee on Pacific railroads
met to-day and agreed on the bill printed
in last Tuesday's Call, the only changes
made being as follows: The payment to be
made by the Central Pacific during the
first ten years is $365,000 instead of $300,
--000; and $550,000 during the second ten
years instead of $500,000; and for every
ten years thereafter, until the debt is dis
charged, $750,000 is to be paid.
Another change provides that "the com
panies shall at all times afford to all other
lines of railroad, equal and reasonable
faoilities for making connections with
them, or eitner of them, and equal facili
ties for transportation of passengers and
freights thereon."
This amendment was adopted so as to
make it appear that there would be no dis
crimination by the roads hereafter.
The bill was submitted to the full com
mittees of both houses to-day. It is al
together probable it will be reported to
the House first. The Senate committee
does not meet again until Friday. There
is a disposition by certain members of this
committee to increase tbe payments to be
made by the Central Pacific, but, as Hun
tington drafted the bill, and as it has been
swallowed at a gulp by sub-committees,
there is little doubt but that the bill will
remain as it is.
The measure was either drafted by
Huntington in toto, or else Powers, Sulzer,
Faris and other members of the sub-com
mittee lied. It was known by The Call
correspondent one week ago that a bill
had been prepared and printed, yet Pow
ers, Sulzer and Faris of the committee de
clared emphatically that they had drafted
no bill, nor had they seen the draft of any
measure. They either lied or allowed
Huntington to draft the bill and then ac
cepted it without any gait. The Call cor
respondent has good reason to believe that
the hill was got up by Huntington and
Senator Frye, and that the "small fry"
members of the sub-committee spoke
truthfully when they said they had not
seen the bill. They were not liars, but
they were Huntington tools and accepted
his dictum without a murmur.
Representative Maguire was asked by
by The Call correspondent to-night what
he thought of the new funding bill, and
said :
"The funding bill said to have been re
ported by the joint sub-committee of the
Committee on Pacific Railroads this after
noon is worse than the Reiliy bill for the
United States Gnvernment and just as bad
as the Reiliy bill for the people of the
Pacific Coast. Everything that was paid
against the Reiliy bill in the Fifty-third
Congress can be urged with equal force
against the new bill. There is one feature
of the new bill which is patentable for its
novelty. 1 refer to the provision extend
ing the corporate life and character of the
Central Pacific Railroad Company for
tbirty-isix years beyond the petiod of ex
istence as absolutely limited by the con
etitutional laws of the State of California,
under which it was incorporated.
"The corporation i 9 an artificial person
created under the laws of the State, by
which the life of every corporation is ab
solutely limited to a period of fifty years.
1 his attempt on the part of the Federal
Government to brush aside State laws, to
override the public policy of the State as
declared in those laws, and to take away
vested rights of the stockholders as others
who have dealt with the corporation upon
the assurance embodied in lawÃ (under
which thÂ« corporation was organized) that
at the end of fifty years from the time of
its incorporation they would enjoy an ab
solute right to have its assets sold and the
proceeds, after the payment of debts,
divided among the stockholders, is an act
of usurpation on the part of the Federal
Government. For this there is no prece
cedent in Federal legislation. But Mr.
Huntington wants it done, and what
do the constitutional rights of State
amount to when they run contrary to his
wish?
"Now that it is certain that the funding
bill is to be reported to the House at this
session of C6ngress and perhaps voted
upon the course to be pursued by Repre
sentatives of California is made clearer.
Heretofore we have taken the position
that no affirmative legislation is required
for a settlement of the Pacific roads debts,
that the foreclosure of mortgages and
sale of railroads to satisfy their debt to the
Government are amply authorized by
existing laws. We have not asked for any
affirmative legislation because the request
would be a tacit admission that
affirmative legislation is necessary
and would tend to precipitate
the consideration of the Pacific
roads bills in the House. That, of course,
was undesirable as long as we could pre
vent it. Now that the matter is to be
brought up for consideration we will en
deavor to agree with Senator Morgan and
other opponents of refunding upon such
measures as will be likely to command tuc
strongest possible support in both Houses.
Senator Morgan has furnished me with an
outlined draft of a bill following the gen
eral scheme covered by his resolutions,
modified somewhat to meet some of our
views, and I think it probable that we can
all agree to support a bill framed on those
lines and to antagonize the funding
scheme in both Houses with such a bill."

MOBBED AND ARRESTED.
Herr Ahlwardt Gets a Rather

Locked Up on Charge of Carrying a

MOBOKEN, N. J., April 6.â Herr Ahl
wardt, the anti-Semitic member of the
German Reichstag, who has been lectur
ing in the United States for some months,
and who was handled rather roughly in
New York some time ago at a meeting he
was addressing, was mobbed to-night by
Hebr ws in this city while on his way to
Germania Hall.
Ernest Freido of Brooklyn, editor of &
paper, said to be published by Ahlwardt,
was in the party and had his jaw smashed
by the crowd.
Ahlwardt and Freido were arrested and
locked up together with several others.
Detective Quinn picked up a pistol which
he says was in the hands of Ahlwardt dur
ing the scrimmage. Ahlwardt was not in
jured beyond a few bruises. Ahlwardt
was released on $100 bail. The technical
charges against the "Jew-baiter" are car
rying concealed weapons and disorderly
conduct.

FROM MISSOURI
1 Gentleman Trom That State
Expresses Opinion
About a Leadlnsr Californlan and
Coast Institution.
IT IS TRUE THAT SOME FEW OK THE VlS-
â¢*â  ltors to the hospitable shores of this Golden
State go back to their homes and tow that Califor-
nia Is populated by "jays," "hayseeds" and so
forth, but they are usually actors of inferior tal-
, ents or disappointed speculators who have at-
tempted to place some not too sweet-smelling
scheme on the market, and hare found that the
people who live here don't take all they hear for
i gospel truth without investigating a little. A crlt-
i iclsm of our great medical institutions, of which
we are so rightly proud, has until now not been
pronounced, but It comes with grace from a man
who has tried and therefore knows whereof he
speaks. It -Is Mr. Frank Minturn who has spoken,
and as he speaks of the Hudson Medical Instl-
. tuteâ lndubitably the greatest and finest of its
. nature on this Slopeâ his remarks are well worth
being reproduced. He writes as follows:
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 9, 1895.
JTurttnn Jlfcdiral Institute. Sail Francisco, CHI.â
Gf.nti.kmkn: A 'ew months ago I placed myself
i under your treatment, as I had been a sufferer foÂ«
a lons time from a complication of diseases that
seemed to successfully resist all treatment. I
must confess that I was at first skeptical about
placing myself under the care of physicians thou-
sands or miles away, but I had reached a point
where something had to Be done at once, as I could
neither sleep nor eat, and my whole system seemed
1 to be completely worn out.
; I now desire to express to you my sincere thanks
for the careful, conscientious and successful man-
ner in which my case has. been treated by you. I
â¢ am a very different man to-day, and I have not
felt as well in five years as I do now. I desire to
say to those who are suffering from diseases of
; long standing, of whatever nature, that it is my
; honest opinion if they will write or apply to ihe
large white building at the corner of Market,
Stockton and Kills streets, .San Francisco, I be-
lieve they will find the relief that they seek, ana
that they will receive the same careful and skillful '
treatment that I did at tile hands of the Hudson
Medical Institute.
Wishing you continued success In your efforts to
aid suffering humanity, I ftm, very truly,
FRANK MINTURN,
St. Louis, Mo.
This is certainly a "very strong Indorsement of
the great institution, but it may be frankly stated
that It Is no better or more frank than several
hundreds of our people, who say things equally
good week In end week out. From Panoche, Cal.
comes this:
Robert Ashurst Jr. writes: "Have gained six
poundi since commencing treatment. I would not
take $500 to relapse into the state I was In be-
fore."
S. J. Bailey of Weavervllle, Cal.: "I will now
j state after two months' treatment with you thai I
i feel fully restored to health."
K. C. Taft of Stow*. CaL. says: "I am feeling
fine, without a sign of disease now."
E. W. Fowler: "lam feeling as good now as It
Is possible for a man to feel."
If space permitted, this sort of testimony coula
ibe prolonged Indefinitely. Never a mail comet
; but there are many letters expressing thanks and
' esteem for what has been done for those who have
placed themselves under the skill of the physicians
; of the HUDSON MEDICAL INSTITUTE, and it
. Is now a proverbial saying that "If you want t*
get cured QUICKLT and CERTAINLY tliat to

Experience of the Steamer
Prinz Wilhelm IV at
Jacmel.
LEAVES PORT QUICKLY.
Haytians Show Their Dislike
for General Hippolyte's
Successor.
SWOOP DOWN FROM MOUNTAINS
During the Shooting That Follows
Ten Men Are Killed and Scores
Wounded.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 6.â The
Dutch steamer Prinz Wilhelm IV, which
arrived this morning from West Indian
and Haytian ports, reports that all was
quiet at the time of leaving Port-au-
Prince. While at Jacmel, on March 17,
there was a riot in the town. General
Manigat's friends had tried to raise a dis
turbance and considerable shooting took
place. Several bullets dropped on the
deck of the Prinz Wilhelm, and Captain
Dorr for the safety of his passengers and
crew was obliged to leave port quickly.
The ship's papers srere sent to him at
Port-au-Prince.
Captain Dorr says that on the death of
Hlppolyte Generals Jaenis and Manigat,
who are much opposed to the Government
of the present President, General T. Simon
i-;-ni, because of his actions while Minister
of War and Marine, made up their minds
to make trouble at the funeral of Hippo
lyte. They swooped down out of the
mountains with a number of their follow
ers while preparations were making for
the funeral. They turned the whole town
upsirte down. Their money was spent in
buying rum and their time in righting
with President Sam's troops and those of
the citizens of Jacmel who objected to
their depredations.
When the Prinz Wilhelm reached Port
au-Prince, which is a twenty-four-ruile run
from .Tacmel, Captain Dorr heard that ten
men had been killed and scores of people
wounded. Toe captain declared that ne
fsw many families of Jacmel leaving that
town and going to the hiils and mountains
and to the houses of rich men to get pro
tection from the rioters. Just before the
vessel mailed from Port-au-Prince the au
thorities boarded the vessel and put on
board twelve exiies. They were not al
lowed to take any money or household
tffo'-ts with them.
UNITED WITH A
SIMPLE SERVICE,
\ Continued from i'irtt JVrjre.J
Indianapolis. The party was accompanied
as far as Philadelphia by some of the
guests, who participated in the wedding
supper, which was served aboard the car.
The fact that General Harrison's daugh
ter, Mrs. McKee, and his son Russell were
not at the wedding occasioned consider
able comment. It has been rumored that
Harrison's family were strongly opposed
to the weddine. While they still retain
ail due affection for their parent, it is said
they decline to give their filial sanction.
The honeymoon will be spent in General ;
Harrisons home in Indianapolis, which i
has been refitted and renovated for the j
occasion. Later the couple will go to the i
Adirondacks, where a house has been pre- '
pared for them. The groom's gift to his
best man was a walking-stick, which was
valued by General Harrison because of its â 
;i"or:ations. Its history dates back to the
civil war, and General Harrison highly
values its possession.
The floral decorations in the church
were simple and artistic. There was no
attempt at display, but a striking effort
Lad been achieved by the free use of
r ,ilies. The edifice was in no way
embellished, all the decorations being
confined in and about, the altar.
The bride's gown was a heavy pearl col
orrd faille Francaise of exquisite luster,
trimmed with rare Honiton lace, which
practically covered the shoulders of tne
gown, failing over the sleeves and contin
uing in wide revers which turn again near
the waist line to form a Louis Quatorze
jacket effect.
Soft full bows of pale turquoise blue vel
vet caught the lace together over a full vest
of chiffon, and the neck was finished with
a soft crush collar of the same velvet. A
lengthwise jabot of Honiton lace was
trimmed either side of the front breadth
<â¢! the skirt, which was cut demi-train, to
bang in graceful waves of fullness. Witn
â¢ . - was worn a small cape of pale blue
velvet trimmed with a white aigrette and
pompon, and a twist of lace confined with
a superb diamond ornament. Another
diamond ornament fastened the lace on one
Bide "i the corsage near the shouider. The
oom's gift to the bride, a magnificent
chain <if pearls, was looped on the corsage.
Mrs. Dimmick's bonnet was small and of
Iku>- velvet trimmed with white aigrette
and small spangles, held in place by jew
e.ed pins.

As they stepped on the platform they I

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., April 6.â Mrs.
Robert McKee, daughter of General Har
rison, wi'l leave here to-morrow for the
East, and will not be present to receive
her father and his bride. She has been
making preparations for her departure
since Mr. Harrison left for New York, and
among the things she will take with her
are several pieces of bric-a-brac, part of the
latter being vases and china painted by
her mother. The furniture consists of
pieces that were associated with her child
hood and will De retained as heirlooms in
the family.
The fact that neither she nor Russell
Harrison attended the wedding is regarded
as conclusive evidence of their distaste for
their stepmother, and their friends no
longer make concealment of the fact that
they are very much disappointed over the
marriage. Mrs. McKee refused to remain
until the bride came, althougn she visited
the house before her father left for New
York and assisted in some arrangements.
Intimate friends say the objection of the
children is not to Mrs. Dimmick person
ally, but to their father's marriage to any
one, Mrs. McKee especially not being able
to reconcile herself to it.
The bridal couple will arrive to-morrow
night at a late hour.
WHY THE CHILDREN OBJECT.
Ex-OovÂ«rnor Shu inters of Nebraska Talks
of the Wedding.
OMAHA. Nebr., April 6. â Ex-Governor
Saunders' attention was called to the tele
gram to the effect that his son-in-law,
Russell Harrison, and Mrs. McKee would
not attend the wedding of their father at
New York to-day, and he said the latest
information he had received was that Mis.
McKee would attend, but he was satisfied
now that none of the children would be
present. As to the feeling of the children
toward their father's marriage, Mr. Saun
ders said that was a delicate subject, and
none appreciated it more than the chil
dren themselves. They had tried to
keep it among themselves, but that it
soon became apparent to the public that
dissatisfaction existed. He said it was
probably lirst an objection to the father
remarrying at all, and then to his marry
ing one so closely allied to the family. It
was not a feeling of bitterness, but more
one of disappointment, which would wear
away. He thought Russell did not care
so much and was disposed to permit his
father to do as he thought best, but with
Mr?. McKee it was different, and she was
deeply sensitive on the subject. Governor
Saunders said the children liad been down
to Indianapolis several times of late and
dined with their father, and it was evident
to him they were disposed to maintain
friendly relations in the family, regardless
of the marriage, yet it did not conceal the
fact that there were some heartburnings
over the ceremony celebrated in New
York.
ON AN ANCIENT FIELD
Rally of Noted Athletes of
Several Countries at
Athens.
Americans Among Those to Win Hon
ors in the Presence of Many
Thousands.
ATHENS, Gkeece. April 6. â To-day
began the 776 th olympian, in which ath
letes from several countries participated.
: The Americans' who took part in the
'. games were the victors in several events,
j despite the fact that they have been here a
j very short time and had nor practiced
! after their long voyage. The weather was
â  mild but cloudy. Early in tbe morning it
! was feared the games would have to be
j postponed on account of rain, but it was
! decided that the grounds were in sufficient
i condition to allow of the opening events
taking place.
More than 40,000 persons were admitted
to the Stadion, including the King of
Greece, the Duke of Sparta, the Crown
Prince and other members of the royal
famity, the members of diplomatic corps
and many other prominent persons.
These 40,000, however, were not the only
ones who witnessed the games. The
Stadion has no roof, and on each side of it
rise hills from which a good view can be
had within the walls. These hills were
fairly black with spectators, thousands of
whom were too poor to pay admission,
but who were determineu to see the re
vival of the games.
The sight was a remarkable one. and
seldom has such interest and enthusiasm
been displayed over any recent event in
the Grecian capital.
The Americans who took part in the
day's events appeared to be in excellent
form and won their victories with appar
ent ease. For the discus throwing the
following Americans were entered: Cap
tain Robert Garrett of Princeton and El
lery Clark of Harvard, a member of the
Boston Athletic Association. Garrett won.
Garrett's throw was considered phenon
enal by the spectators. He threw the
discus 29.15 meters, defeating the Greek
champion, Paraskevopoulos, by 19.centi
meters.
The first half of the 100 metres race was
won by P. W. Lane of Princeton, in 12 1-5
seconds. Szokoly, a Hungarian, was sec
ond.
The second half was won by T. P. Cur
tis of Boston, whose time wes 12 1-5 sec
onds. M. Chalkokondylis, an Athenian,
was second.
The third heat was won by T. E. Burke
of the Boston Athletic Association in 11%
seconds. Hoffman, a German, was second.
In the hop-step-and-jump James Con
nolly, a member of Suffolk Athletic Club,
covered 13.7 metres. Tufferi, a French
man, was second.
In tne first beat of the 400-metre race H.
B. Jamison of Princeton was first and the
German, Hoffman, second.
The second heat was won by Burns, an
Englishman, with Gimoly second.
The first heat of the 800 meter race was
won by Flack, an Austra-Lermesuix. A
Frenchman won the second hear.
The winners in the several events were
applauded. Everything passed off with
out a bitcli ana the revival of the games
has been most successful. All ;tlie finals
will be run Friday.

Southern California in Danger of
Falling Into the Clutches
of Huntington.
MASS-MEETING TO BE HELD.
Stirring Call Issued From the League

Send Petitions.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 6.â Nothing
daunted by the fact that the river and
harbor bill passed the House carrying an
appropriation of only $50,000 for dredging
the inner harbor at San Pedro and nothing
for Santa Monica, the partisans of these
seaport rivals for Government favors con
tinue their contention over the question as
to which should receive the support of
Uncle Sam.
Caucusing and telegraphing between Los
Angeles and Washington continue. A
meeting of the Free-harbor League was
held at the Chamber of Commerce this
morning. The secretary was instructed
to forward to Senator White and
Representative McLachlan a dis
patch asking them to take a
position on the harbor question which, in
the opinion of nearly every prominent
citizen of Southern California, was the
best for the interest of Los Angeles at this
junctureâ to restore the full amount of
$392,000 originally proposed to be appro
priated for the improvement of the inner
harbor at San Pedro, to push the pro
posed amendment for an appropriation,
to estimate the cost of dredging tne bar to
a depth of twenty-five feet, and to transfer
the proposed appropriation of $2,800,000
for the construction of an outer harbor at
Santa Monica to San Pedro. The greatest
enthusiasm was evoked when the commit
tee appointed to draw up a call for a mass
meeting submitted the following fiery re
port, which was adopted:
To the citizens of Los Angeles and vicinity :
This is a critical period in the history of Los
Angeles and Southern California. Upon the
action of Congress in regard to the location of
a Government deep-water harbor for this sec
tion depends largely our commercial indepen
dence and consequently our future prosperity.
The exceptionally favored commercial loca
tion of Los Aneeles, on the shortest line be
tween the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, at the
foot of low mountain passes, insures us the
trade between this coast and Asia; also, after
the Nicaragua canal shall have been completed,
a still more extensive and world-wide com
merce.
Unfortunately the knowledge of these facts
ha? aroused the cupidity of a grasptng and
avaricious corporation, which for s quarter of
a century hns held two-thirds of this great
State in bondage. The wonderful growth that
] has been made by Los Angeles and South
! em California during the past ten years,
i in comparison with San Francisco and the
I northern part of the State, is undoubtedly due
I to the fact that we have enjoyed the blessing of
I overland railway competition, while ourneigh
i bors in the north have been at the tender
â  mercies of a single raiiway monopoly that has.
' vampire-like, sucked the life-blood of com
; merce, killed honest ambition and demoralized
i the community by open and notorious bribery
â¢ and corruption.
That same corporation has, with devilish
; persistence and ingenuity, backed by the free
i use of metallic arguments, been seeking to add
I Southern California to the territory which it
; rules by diverting millions ot the people's
; money from a free harbor site, thrice recom
i mended by Government engineers, to one
where the Southern Pacific would control the
water front, as it does in Oakland.
It is a known fact that Mr. Huntington con
â¢ trols a majority of the bonds of the Atlantic
! and Pacific road. This was shown by the re
| f usal of the road to become a party to the re-
I cent Santa Fe reorganization. It is a fact
i well known that at the present time
the road is connected with the San
|ta Fe system only through temporary
I traffic arrangements, that may be terminated
at any time that the Southern Pacific may
J take possession of it. With a private harbor
I built for him by the Government, Mr. Jlunt
ington would be in a position to throw such
obstacles in the way as to prevent the construc
tion of the long-looked-for road from Salt Lake,
| and we should then be practically at thg
| mercy of the .Southern Pacific Company, as are
j the people of Pan Francisco.
In short, San Pedro will be a free harbor,
I open to the transportation systems of the
j country on terms of absolute equality. The
i contrary is true of the site which has received
i the sanction only of the Southern Pacific Com
! pany and its hired experts, and which would
| be virtually the property of a corporation that
stands for the apotheosis of railroad. monopoly.
The time has arrived when patience on the
part of the people of this section ceases to be a
virtue. When we see a rich and rapidly
! growing community tryinsr for years in vain to
j obtain a modest annual appropriation for
a free, open harbor, that has been re-
I peatedly indorsed by Government experts,
while a private harbor for which the
people have not asked and which the engi
neers have characterized as undesirable for
j purposes of commerce and defense, is offered
I $3,000,000, it is certainly time for free
and independent citizens of Los Angeles
to express in no uncertain language their
astonishment and indignation at so outra
geous and alarming a condition of affairs,
and to denounce in plain terms the absurd
j and insulting arguments of those hired tools
| of this unscrupulous corporation, who would
| have us believe that it would be a good thing
I for Los Angeles to barter her commercial pros
perity for a little assistance in deepening the
inner harbor at San Pedro.
The effort of these individuals to have the
labor element indorse the nefarious scheme is
a further insult to the intelligent workingmen
of this section. The Southern Pacific was the
first corporation on the Pacific Coast to import
and employ jChinese coolies on a large scale,
and it continues to employ them wherever
they can be used to advantage.
It is now, in contravention of the alien labor
law, importing and employing ignorant Mexi
can and Indian peons from Mexico. The rock
to be used in constructing a Government har
bor at Mr. Huntington's site would be pur
chased of Mr. Huntington. the cost of trans
portation would be paid to him, and the work
done by oheap imported labor.
Such being the facts of the case, the Free
Harbor League calls upon citizens of this sec
tion to assemble at the east front of
the courthouse on New High and Tem
ple streets on Wednesday evening, April S,
at 7:30 o'clock, to express their opinion
on this contemplated outrage in such unmis
takable terms as will remove any remaining
uncertainty in the minds of our representa
tives and of Congress as to the atiitude of the
people of southern California in regard to the
harbor question,
The Free Harbor LEAGrE of Los Angeles.
W. D. Woolwine, Secretary.
Arrangements have been made to run a
special train from San Pedro on Wednes
day evening. Good music and eloquent
speaKers have been secured and there is
every reason to believe that the meeting
will be one of the liveliest held in Los
Angeles.
The officers of the Sheetiron and Cor
nice-workers'. Plasterers', Stonecutters'
and Shinglers' union? and the Building
Trades Council to-day forwarded a tele
gram to Senator White and Representative
McLachlan indorsing the petition wired to
them yesterday by the officers of eighteen
sister unions, urging them to work for San
Pedro or nothing.
At this afternoon's session of the City
Council the following resolution was
unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That the interests of this city de
mand all harbor facilities we can secure, and
to that end we urge that the appropriation of
$3,000,000 for Han Pedro and Sauta Monica
harbors be made.

Decision in a Case Affecting Two Thou-
sand Holders.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 6.-Judge
Van Dyke of the Superior Court to-day
rendered an opinion affecting adversely
nearly 2000 people in this county, who are
interested in litigation in which it is sought
to enjoin County Tax Collector A. H.
Merwin from executing deeds to the State
for property sold for delinquent taxes.
All the cases are not alike, the circum
stances varying. In the case ruled upon
to-day points are involved which affect
about 400 owners of possessory interests.
It appears from the complaint in this
action that the possessory interest in the
land in question was assessed against him
prior to 1878, and that on March 9,
1878, his interest so assessed was sold
to the State for delinquent taxes;
that in July, 1881, he proved up his claim
on the lands, and in February, 1882, a
patent was issued to him therefor from
the Government of the United States. It
is alleged that the sale made by the tax
collector for the possessory coin to the
State was irregular and void, and an in
junction was asked against the defendant
to prevent him from issuing deed upon
said tax sale. To this complaint a de
murrer was interposed. The court in sus
taining this demurrer used the following
language:
"There is no reason apparently in law or
ethics, why taxes which are admitted to
have been properly levied and assessed,
should be discharged without payment
simply because of the fact that the
party owing the taxes had subsequently
acquired the fee simple title from the
Government of the United States. The
only restriction is that the State, in
levying and collecting taxes, shall not
interfere with the primary disposal of
the public lands on the part of the
United States, and the complaint itself
shows that the levying of this tax and sale
in question has not in the least interfered
with the sale and disposal of the land in
question.
"The complaint, therefore, does not
show a cause of action justifying the issu
ing of the injunction and the demurrer
will be sustained, and the order to show
cause why an injunction should not issue
be discharged."
The case will be appealed to tbe Supreme
Court.
STANFORD'S JUNIOR DAY
Eccentric Features in Prepara-
tion for the Holiday of
the Class of '97.
Nearly a Hundred Students to Take
Part in the Coming Rendi-
tion of "Said Pasha."
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
6.â There is a rush of preparations of a
social nature which are taking up a great
deal of attention here just at present.
What with preparations for junior day
and commencement week scores of com
mittees*are worked up to a high tension of
activity. Junior day has been set apart
as a holiday by the faculty committee, and
the junior class has planned festivities
which will occupy every hour from morn
ing until night. It is the custom, on these
occasion?, for each class to do something a
little more striking than any act by a pre
ceding class annual, not only in the way
of entertainment, but in some humorous
caper that will keep up the merriment for
that day. The junior committee is main
taining secrecy in the matter, but it is un
derstood it has several pranks ready for
execution on the 18th of April.
It is already arranged to have field-day
sports, which may taku place in the after
noon. An original farce written by a
member of the' junior class will be pre
sented. J. M. Ross, one -of Stanford's in
tercollegiate debaters, is the author. The
junior dance, called the "Prom," will be
held in the evening, and is to be a swell
affair. The tickets arc to sell at $5.
The opera "Said Pasha" is to be given
here by students on Friday and Saturday
next. The sale of tickets has been im
mense and the performance is to be very
elaborate. The expense of scenery and
costumes alone will exceed $<>50. Nearly
100 students will be included in the cast.
All of them have been rehearsini: regularly
for three months past. The stage and
scenery are now being put up in the
Eni-ina trymnasium, which seats about
1000 people,
A subscription list has been started for
the benelit of the track fund and it is meet
ing with decided success. The list is be
ing backt-d by the college daily paper and
the track men. The cinder path is in poor
condition and the athletes demand that
it be put into shape at once. They further
point out the need of a training-table,
coach and professional rubber, all of which
will be supplied if the subscription list
succeeds, as it promises to do.
Since their Southern trip the glee and
mandolin clubs have been discussing the
feasibility of an Eastern tour. All the
members are enthusiastic and if $1000 can
be guaranteed the cinbs willprobabiv leave
on June 1 in a special car for Eastern
cities.
Dr. Jordan will lecture in San Francisco
on Wednesday ni-ht before the Japanese
mission. On Friday night he speaks on
"The Rise of the Coming Man" in San
Jose and on Saturday night he will speak
again at Golden Gate Hall, San Francisco,
on '"Centralization in Local Government.' 1
JTAIHFIJChD TEST SUIT.
County Officers to Ascertain thi> Length
of Their Tenure.
VALLEJO, Cal., April 6.â A dispatch to
the v'alle jo Chronicle from Fairlield says:
An important matter, which is aimed to
test the law making the terms of county
officers of four years' duration, came up
before the Board of Supervisors at the
meeting to-day in the form of a resolution
instructing County Clerk Halliday to pro
cure supplies whioSi will be necessary to
conduct an election for county officers in
November next. It is understood this
move is backed by the officers who are to be
affected if the law is unconstiiutional, and
they are represented by Garret W. Mc-
Inerney. one of the ablest constitutional
lawyers in the State.
The Supervisors adopted the resolution,
with the explicit understanding that the
county would be put to no expense by it.
Clerk llalliclay will carry out the order of
the board, but will be enjoined by some one
interested in the cause of the four-year
term. This will bring the matter before
Judge A. J. Buckles for a Superior Court
decision as to the necessity for procuring
tne supplies, which, if the four-year term
is constitutional, will stop the clerk from
obtaining them. This, too, will enable
the attorneys to take the matter to the
Supreme Court and get a final decision at
an early date.
KAWEAH RIVER

Tulare County Property-
Owners Involved in
Litigation,
JASPER HARRELL'S SUIT
Attempts to Set Aside the St.
Johns Eiver Association
Award.
VAST TRACTS ARE AFFECTED.
Title to Real Estate Declared to Have
Been Alienated by Arbi
tration.
VISALIA, Cal., April 6.â Prior to 1892
there was a great deal of litigation in Tu
lare County over water rights in the
Kaweah River, and the ditch-owners and
riparian owners concluded to form an as
sociation to prevent the loss occasioned by
the numerous suits.
After much deliberation and many con
ferences the St. Johns River Association
was formed, and the claims of nearly all
the parties taking water out of the river
were left to arbitration. Six ditch compa
nies and two riparian owners aereed to
the award made, but it is alleged that sev
eral ditch companies and many riparian
owners did not accept the findings of the
commission appointed to settle the matter.
Among the riparian owners who did not
agree to the terms of settleme was Jasper
Harrell, the millionaire land and cattle
owner. Recently Harrell has had trouble
with the association, and his attorneys to
day filed a motion in the Superior
Court to have the award set aside,
generally on the ground that
it was not made according to law, ana
specifically because all the riprarian own
ers and ditch companies using water out
of the Kaweah River were not made par
ties in the arbitration. It is alleged that
the award alienates the title to real e3tate,
and this, it is claimed, is prohibited by the
code.
Large property interests are involved
and the litigation will excite much in
terest in the irrigated portions of Tulare
and King counties.
Khlt.\ COt'.Vrr LITIGATION.
Revival of the Fight Between Bnggin <&
Tevia and Miller Jk Lux.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., April 6.â The
suit for water rights of the Farmers' Canal
Company and other canal corporations vs.
Simmons et al. came up in the Superior
Court this morning, Judge Shaw of Los
Angeles having been called to preside, be
cause one of the attorneys for the defense
is a relative of Judge Conklin.
The defense was represented by Messrs.
Houghton. Eugene Garber and Patrick
Reddy, while E. J. McCutchen, G. C. Gor
ham and J. W. Ahem represented plain
tiff?. Several individual defendants were
also represented by attorneys.
The defense asked for a continuance
until next fall. Houghton stated that
those defendants whom he, Reddy and
Garber represented proposed to stand
squarely on the terms of the Haggin and
Miller contract; that they proposed to live
up to that contract to the letter, and that
whatever rights they claimed were based
upon the provisions of that contract.
Some of the defendants, he said, were
parties to that contract and it was desired
to hie one answer setting up the interests
of those who had signed the contract and
another answer for those who had not
signed it. To tnat end it was essential
that further time be had.
McCutchen asked whether Houghton
and his associates proposed to continue
to represent the defendants who had and
those who had not signed the contract,
and Houghton replied that Me did not
know whether they would or not. A con
tinuance until November 9 was granted.
From statements made in open court it
now seems quite clear that the case will re
solve itself into a three-cornered fight, the
plaintiffs claiming against all defendants
and certain defendants claiming against
other defendants.
It is probable that the old dispute be
tween Haggin <fc Tevis and Miller & Lux
will be fought over again, as the present
case goes straight to the heart of that con
test.
POCATELLO TRAGEDY.
Officer Scan/on Dies From the Knife
Wound Inflicted by a Murderous
Vagrant.
POCATELLO, Idaho, April 6.â James B.
Scanlon, the policeman who was stabbed
yesterday by a tramp, expired in awful
agony at 10:30 o'clock this morning. No
trace of the murderer has yet been d'scov
ercd, although searching parties are yet on
the hunt. A man was caught at Bancroft
this morning who answered his descrip
tion, and Deputy Caldwell and party left
on a special train immediately, but he
proved to be the wrong man. Indignation
runs high, and if the vagrant is caught no
mercy will be shown. Several small re
ward's have been offered, and Sheriff Sulli
van has requested Governor McConnell to
offer a reward on behalt of Idaho.
Scanlon had many friends and was a
brave and efficient officer. He was to have
been married shortly. He had joined the
Woodmen of the World three weeks ago,
and will be buried on Wednesday by that
order. He was 33 years old. A sister, Miss
Kate Scanlon of Bombay, N. V., survives
him.

Financial Question Cuitaes Friction in
the Democratic Convention.
PORTLAND, Or., April 6.â The finan
cial question was the cause of the first
sign of factional strife in the city and
county Democratic convention to-day.
After the election of ex-Governor Glover,
who is a gold man, as chairman of the
convention an adjournment was taken
until late in the afternoon. Upou the re
assembling of the delegates and the hear
ing of the report of the credentials com
mittee an adjournment was taken until
after the Republican convention, no nom
inations being made.
The Hume-Frank Minto seceders in the
Republican county convention met tnis
afternoon. A platform and resolutions
were adopted and a statement for the pub
lic prepared. The meeting then decided to
adjourn without nominating a ticket.
SANTA CRUZ COURTHOUSE WAR.
Judge Logan Will Hold Forth in the New
Building, Even Though He Must
Resort to Force.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 6.â Judge
Logan of the Superior Court says he will
hold court in the new courthouse on April
11 if he has to do it by force.
The recent activity of the contractor on
the new courthouse had led people to be
lieve the work would be completed with
out further delay or disagreements, but
there occurred to-day an incident that,
while it may not delay the progress of the
wort, may cause legal complications.
Judge .Logan of the Superior Court
learned that Contractor McCabe would
seek to prevent him from occupying a
room in the building for court purposes on
April 11. The grounds for this he did not
learn, and McCabe is not to be found to
give his reason.
Judge Logan declares that nothing shall
prevent him, as he deems it technically
necessary to hold court before April 14, in
order to avoid any complications by the
Cooper estate, from whom the lots were
deeded to the county. There was a pro
vision in the deed that the ground should
not be unoccupied for court purposes for a
period of two years.
The old courthouse was destroyed by
fire on April 13, 1894, and the new build
ing should have been completed by the
contractor last February. It will not be
completed for another month, but a room
may be ready to hold court in next Satur
day, and the Judge says it shall be ready ;
if not he will use an unfinished room.

rvessa he bequeathed as follows: One
fourth to ; Nora Bailey, *a â¢ daughter, and.
one-fourth each to Homer H. and. Joseph

Kerns charged that at the time of making
the will, April 12, 1892, Kerns was of un
sound mind and unable to transact his
own business. He was possessed of insane
delusions, one of which was a decided
antipathy to his wife, and according to
her story Mrs. Kerns was shabbily treated
in the will. .

CARSON BRIBERY CASE.
Judge Hawley Sustains ihe Demurrer to
the Indictment Against Trenmor
Coffin.
CARSON, Nev., April G.â Judge Hawley
to-day rendered his decision as to the de
murrer in the indictment against Attorney
Trenmor Coflin, charsied with bribing wit
nesses in the Heney case. He sustained
the demurrer oh the grounds that the in
dictment did not set forth that the de
fendant had knowledge of the fact that
Langevin was a witness. He cited several
authorities in support of his ruling, but
principally Pettitbone vs. the United
States, quotin.2 an opinion by Chief Justice
Fuller in which the lollowinc language was
used :
It seems clear that an indictment against a
person for complicity, either by threut, force
or corruption, in endeavoring to influence, in
timidate or compel a witness or an officer in a
court of the United States must charge knowl
edge or notice, or set forth facts that show
knowledge or notice on the part of the accused,
that the witness or officer was such.
The Government relied on the sustain
ing of the indictment on the following au
thorities on criminal pleading and prac
tice, section 164, which says:
Wbon the statement of the act itself reason
ably indicates a knowledge of the illegality of
the act no averment is necessary.
The case will come up before the next
Grand Jury, and if it does not act the
United States Attorney, who is determined
to suppress jury bribing in Government
cases, will proceed on information regard
less of the Gran.l Jury.

JNO. MONAIIAN, 418 Commercial St.
As I live by the pen I must say that one
of the most pleasant and affable gentlemen
it has been my good fortune to meet po-
litely gave me an interview yesterday. His
nan.c is John Monahan and he is a printer.
A printer known far and wide on the Pa-
cific Coast. People had told me of Mr.
Monahan so that I had come prepared to
meet a good-natured man and was not at
all embarrassed when he smilingly told ma
what he thought of California, her prod-
ucts and her Sarsaparilla. Said|he: "On
the subject of Sarsaparilla my opinion is
fixed. "While I have no reason to know or
to say that other sarsaparillas are of no
value, I have every reason to know and to
say that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is of
inestimable value, for not only have some
of my relatives used it, but I have actually
tried the Sarsaparilla and know its true
value. It is a delicate matter for one to
speak of the virtues of a proprietary rem-
edy, nevertheless, the truth stands in the
bright light of reason and overcomes deli-
cate feelings, for the truth is mighty, and
the mighty truth is that Joy's Sarsaparilla
is made of California herbs and contains
no deleterious mineral poisons. lam per-
sonally acquainted with a gentleman who
suffered from violent headaches and he
suffered continuously, and perhaps would
have been suffering now but that he used
the home remedy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla. He recommends Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla and so do 1. It is a very
pleasing remedy for women, because it is
not nasty to the taste and its effects are
pleasant. In the Spring of the year when
nature is at work renewing herself, he who
desires to renew and make rich the blood
can do no better than use the home rem-
edy, Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla."
As I left John Monahan the printer I
could not help but think what an abund-
ance of philosophic humor he possessed.

FATALLY BURNED
NEAR WILLITS
A Peculiar Accident Ends
the Life of a Stage
Driver.
PERISHES IN A FIRE.
His Coach Is Overturned and
the Side-Lamps on the
Vehicle Explode.
PINNED UNDER THE WRECK.
Oil Saturates His Clothing and His
Body Is Cremated by the
Flames.
UKIAH, Cal., April 6.â News of a pecu
liar and horrible accident, that resulted in
the death of Eihelbert A. Whitcomb, the
driver of a stage running from Ukiah to
Willets, was brought to this city to-day.
Whitcomb was pinned beneath his coach,
overturned in the darkness last night, and
was burned to death, oil from the side
lamns on the vehicle having saturated his
clothing and the cushions. His charred
body was found by Walter P. Marble, a
farmer living near Booneville.
Marble was en route from Laytonville to
"Willitts yesterday. About three miles
north of Willitts tne stage which left Wil
litts last evening at about 6 o'clock was
found overturned and partly destroyed by
fire. The running-gear of the coach was
intact and the horses were still attachea
to it.
Driver Whitcomb's body was found
burned to a crisp under ruins of the stage.
All the express and mail matter had been
destroyed. The mail was an unusually
heavy one. The value of the express mat
ter destroyed is unknown.
There were no passengers on the stage
at the time of the accident. It is pre
sumed that, the night being an unusually
dark one. the driver lost his way. This
theory is borne out by the fact that the
stage was found off, but headed toward
the main road.
The driver evidently discovered that he
was on the wrong road after having trav
eled on a road leading to Norton's mill for
some distance. In turning the coach
around it was upset. The lamps on the
outside of the vehicle exploded, and the
clothes of the driver were saturated with
oil running from the.lamj ?.
Whiteomb was evidently unconscious or
pinned under the body of the stage and
unaMe to extricate hiru?elf. As a result
of the explosion the coach and its con
tents were soon in flames, and the brave
driver met his death in the fire.
Wbitcoint) was a married man, and a
widow and two children survive him. He
was honer-t and industrious, and there is
no question but that he was perfectly sober
at the time of the accident.
The stage had left Willetts at 6 o'clock,
and was to have reached Laytonville at
breakfast time. It was one of the through
line from this place to Eureka.
TROUBLE AT SANTA ROSA
Cozad Will Contest the Election
of McMinn as Street
Commissioner.
Claims the Democrats Won by Vio
lating the Purity of Elec
tion Laws.
PANTA ROSA, Cal., April 6.â The ex
citing contest at the polls for the various
city offices will be followed by a struggle
in the courts for at least one of the offices.
There were four candidates in the field
for the Street Commissionership, three
being regularly nominated by the severa
parties and one running as an independent.
Jobn McMinn, the Democratic nominee,
received the highest number of votes, and
"Doc" Cozad, the present incumbent, who
ran independently, was second best.
Cozad now declares that he has proo
that the successful candidate and John
Carleton, the Republican nominee, had a
secret understanding before election and
made certain agreements which conflict
with the provisions of the purity of elec
tions law.
Cozad claims that both of the old party
nominees were members of the American
Protective Association and that this organ
ization threw its strength, irrespective of
party, to the successful aspirant.
Cozad also claim- thatCarle:on and Mc-
Minn had an agreement in writing, drawn
up by a well-known attorney of this city,
in which it was stipulated that the suc
cessful candidate should bear ail of the
loser's campaign expenses and confer
other favor?.
The vote will be canvassed by the City
Council to-morrow night, and Cozad will
make an attempt to enjoin the council
from counting tne vote for ilcMinn.
Cozad will, of course, hold the office dur
ing any litigation which may follow, and
a prolonged struggle is looked for.
He declares that his intention is to call
as witnesses every man whom he suspects
of being an American Protective Associa
tion member, to prove the alleged agree
ment.
TRICKED Jtr A MONGOL.
Jtoon Kee Deceived the Port Officials But
It as Detected. .
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 6.-Doon
Kee, who claims to be a Chinese merchant
of this city, was arrested here this after
noon by Inspector Lynch of San Francisco
and charged with being in the United
States without legal right.
The Chinaman arrived from the Orient
some time in January, and was detained
in San Francisco pending an i investiga
tion. He asserted that"' he was - a mer
chant of Santa Rosa, and backed' his as
sertion with the usual certificate signed by
several white men.
He also produced a woman and a boy
whom he claimed were his wife and son'
to prove his previous residence. On this
showing the almond-eyed son of far-away
Cathay was allowed to proceed to Santa
Rosa with his devoted wife and son, there
to resume his business of merchandising on
Second street.
Now comes Inspector Lynch, who de
clares that the cunning Celestial's busi
ness consists of dispensing opium to
Santa Rosa "fiends," that his store
iÂ§ a "joint." that his son was
borrowed for the occasion, and that his de
voted wife is the keeper of an opium den.
A United States Marshal will arrive here
to-morrow to remove the prisoner to San
Francisco, where an effort will be made to
deport him to his native country.
VICTORIANS FLEECED.
Bunkoed by a Swindler Who Carried Bogus
Testimonials From Prominent
Californians.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 6.â Many Vic
torians are mourning the hasty departure
from this city of a California gentleman
named John Hill, who arrived about two
months ago, and who swindled numerous
trades people out of amounts of from $10
to $20.
Hill posed as a representative of a num
ber of San Francisco capitalists, who were
about to interest themselves in British
Columbia real estate or mines, or, in fact,
any other promising business of the place.
His testimonials bore the names of Claus
Spreckels, E. J. Baldwin and Chief
Crowlpy.
With such backing he found little
trouble in raising modest sums at times.
To the unwary be often appeared upon a
remarkably short acquaintance, present
ing his testimonials and asking for a loan
of probably $20, "just till to-morrow." At
the same time he would count a big roll
of bills, invariably with haste, to show
that he was just lacking the amount
asked for to meet an urgent bank account.
Just how many Hill victimized in this
way is not known, and his operations
would no doubt have gone on for some
time were it not that he made a few mis
takes. One of these was his statement
that he was the discoverer of the famous
Hill Bar on the Frazer River.
During his stay in Victoria Hill bonded
several properties and had arranged to
make his first payment on these lands on
April fool's day. Hill is described as
middle aged, with full, round face and
slight mustache.
SALT LUKE MORMON LAW
Excitement Caused by an Edict
Issued by the Semi-Annual
Conference.
Moses Thatcher Deposed for Accept-
irjg a Nomination for the
Senatorship.
SALT LAKE, Utah, April 6.â The semi
annual conference of the Mormon church
was closed to-night by the issuance of a
manifesto which has created a great deal
of excitement and not a little dismay
among the Gentiles and a few of the more
independent members of the Mormon
church.
The manifesto is a Tery carefully corded
document and sets forth, without disclaim
ing on the part of the heads of the church
any desire that the church should domi
nate over the State, a new proposition.
The incidents of last fall's election, when
two men, Moses Thatcher and B. H.
Robert?, high in office in the church, were
convicted of accepting nominations on the
Democratic ticket without receiving
first the permission of the presi
dency, are referred to, and then the mani
festo says that the church members have
agreed to and now promulgate a rule that,
before accepting any position, political or
otherwise, members of the church who
hold any church office (and 70 per cent of
Mormon people do hold church offices)
must apply to the proper authorities and
learn from them whether they will be per
mitted to accept such position.
To maintain proper discipline and order
in the church, the manifesto says, this
rule is deemed absolutely necessary.
Their position as denned is that a man
having accepted the honors and obligations
of ecclesiastical offices in the church
cannot of his own volition make such
honors subordinate or even co-ordinate
with new ones of an entirely different
character, and is bound to obey the priest
hood before assuming any other such posi
tion.
Moses Thatcher, who accepted the nom
ination for United States Senator without
consulting the presidency, was deposed
from his office as an apostle in the church
during the conference.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 1896.
SANTA BARBARA
ELECTS OFFICERS
Exciting Municipal Contest
in the Quaint Seaside
Town.
WHITNEY NOW MAYOR.
Brastow the Only Member of
the Present Council to Be
Defeated.
JOSE FERNANDEZ'S CAMPAIGN.
Gallant Race Made by the Putative
Colonel of the Fourth New Jersey
Infantry.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 6.â
Santa Barbara to-day passed through the
most exciting municipal election that has
ever taken place in the history of the city.
An extraordinary vote was polled for a
town of less than 7000 population, nearly
1400 voters having goue to the polls. The
only distinct ticket put in the field was
nominated by the Good Citizens' Club,
having James T. Johnson, for many
years Auditor of the county, at its head,
with Frank Maguire, W. S. Day, J. D.
Axtell, W. E. Gilbert and J. B. Fulwider
as candidates for Councilmen in the respec
tive wards. A man named Viebahn, a
mechanic of excellent character but little
known, was named for marshal. The
opposing candidates in the held were
partly volunteers and partly consisted of
the present officials. Frank Whitney,
a prominent insurance man and with an
irreproachable record, also took the field
for Mayor, and to him the honor fell.
The old Councilmen, with the exception
of Barstow, were all re-elected. A. S.
Cooper will remain Councilman from the
Fourth Ward and Smith from the Second;
Lataillade of the Third and Welsh of the
First are also re-elected. H. B. Barstow,
former Councilman of*the Fifth Ward, is
succeeded by W. S. Day. W. H. Maris is
elected to the office of City Tax Collector:
D. W. Martin to that of City Marshal, and
W. A. Higtrins becomes City Assessor.
The race for Police Judge was hotly con
tested between W. H. \Vheaton and b. S.
Price, Price being elected by a small ma
jority.
It was perhaps due to the third candidate
for Mayor more than any other reason that
the election has been one ol such excite
ment. Colonel Jose Lorenzo Fernandez is
a local character of more than ordinary
attainments and of extraordinary versa
tility. The colonel claims to have com
manded the Fourth New Jersey Infantry
during the civil war, but owing to the
stupidity of some official of the War
Department his name and title did not ap
pear upon the roster, la Santa Barbara,
where he has resided for nearly a score of
years, he is known as the owner of a genu
ine Murillo, which has been generously
offered for sale for $60,000, but which jeal
ous critics have scoated as spurious. He
is a carpenter by trade, an all-around phil
anthropist by profession and a vegetable
vender by practice, having his quarters in
a picturesque old adobe on State street.
Colonel Jose Lorenzo Fernandez has
been the speechmaker of the cam
paign. Clad in full regimentals, his un
varying party dress, he has addressed vast
audiences from a dry-goods box and has
set forth his policy in terms which admit
of no dubious interpretation; and had the
election turned upon the self-assertion of
those graces which best tit a man to enact
the part of a city's chief magistrate upon
purely social occasions, the colonel might
have been sure of success. But there has
been a grave suspicion in certain circles
that he waÃ not sound on parliamentary
law.

GOLD IN MOJAVE DESERT
Inexperienced Prospectors Strike
a Remarkably Rich
Ledge.
Portions of the Quartz Will Yield
$5000 to the Tonâ Miners Flock
ing to ihe Scene.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., April 6.â A re
markable story of a rich mining discovery
comes from the Mojave desert in the south
eastern part of this county. The find was
made last week by three "tenderfoot"
brothers named Ashford, who knew abso
lutely notliine about mining. They had
made a failure of ranching here and de
cided to go prospecting on the desert. They
started nine weeks ago, and for seven
weeks worked on the desert without realiz
ing anything.
Then they accidentally stumbled on to a
ledge 2500 feet long, the croppings show
ing free gold, which can be seen witn the
nuked eye in quartz at a distance twenly
tive or thirty feet. The vein is two feet
thick, and a large share will run $5000 to
the ton.
The ledge is located sixty miles east of
Mojave, in the midst of the desert and
thirteen miles from water. It was found
last week, and a big rush has 9et in. The
men who have located the ledge are thor
oughly reliable and don't want to sell the
mine, and the report of the discovery is
authentic. Experienced miners say they
never before saw such a mass of rich rock.
THE TRAGEDY A T SISSONS
A Murder Committed Fifteen
Years Ago Recalled by
a Suicide.
Carrie Eradley, Convicted of Com
plicity in the Killing, Ends Her
Life With a Bullet.
PORTLAND, Ore.. April 6.â Carrie
Bradley, one of the most notoriouswomen
ever having lived in Portlar.d, committed
suicide a few days ago by shooting herself
through the right temple at Sisson, Cal.
The cause of the self-murder was attrib
uted to the loss of her lover, "Pete" Sulli
van, who a year ago was sent to San Quen
tin from San Francisco for a term of five
years for enticing young girls to Carrie
Bradlev's hou^e. She was absolutely de
void of womanly feeling.
Carrie Bradley came to Portland in 1877,
but her career terminated in this city in
the fall of 1-SBl, when she, with the a.-sist
ance of Charley Hamilton, her hus
band, who once was foreman of the
United Carriage and Baggage Company in
San Francisco, and Sullivan, chloroformed
James Brown to death in her house, to
prevent him from appearing against her
in a robbery cast. The murder was not
discovered until a week later, when
Brown's body, concealed in a trunk, was
fished out of the river.
Meanwhile tne Bradley woman had fled
to San Francisco via Victoria, B. C, but
she was arrested at the bay on a telegram
warrant just as she was leaving the
steamer. Later Sullivan was taken into
custody in Woodland, Hamilton succeed
ing in escaping to Mazatlan. Mexico.
Carrie Bradley was convicted in this city
of manslaughter and was sentenced to
twelve years in the Sftlem penitentiary,
but Governor Moody pardoned her after
the lapse of five years.
Sullivan got five years and served his
whole sentence. Upon the expiration of
his term he and the woman moved to
Sisson, where their home has since been.
Hamilton continued a murderous career.
Soon after his arrival in Mazatlan he
kil.led a Mexican in a gambling row, for
which he was sent to prison for twenty
years.
The story goes that the Portland and
sound gamblers made up a $5000 purse to
obtain his pardon, winch was accomplished
After Hamilton's liberation in Mexico he
went to Seattle, but he was never molested
for his participation in the Brown murder.
The fellow, though, had become a very
bad man, constantly geiting into quarrels,
and in one of these he seriously cut a
Seattle man with a dirk and tied from the
town. That was eight years ago, and
since then nothing has been heard of him.
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.
Readers Who Act Promptly Can Still
Secure the J*ew Dictionary.
The recent distribution by the Pacific
Coast Newspaper Syndicate of 500 intro
ductory sets of the new Encyclopaedic Dic
tionary resulted in much satisfaction to
those who were fortunate enough to secure
the work on the terms offered. But those
who did not act promptly and whose ap
plication therefore came in too late, have
lately besieged Syndicate headquarters
with requests for the much-desired vol
umes at the special price and on the re
markably easy terms of payment then
offered.
Very many of these requests come from
those remote communities whose oppor
tunities for inspection were not favorable,
and these beinc; now fully convinced of the
genuineness and worth of the offer of
course uesire to participate.
The Syndicate also 'naturally wisheÃ to
place sets of the work at those more dis
tant points for the purpose of the favor
able publicity to be received from com
parison with other dictionaries and ency
clopedias.
It has, therefore, been arranged to inaug
urate a supplemental distribution for this
week only, during which time the work
will find a place in many towns and com
munities where it is not now known.
This week, however, positively closes the
distribution, wben the regular subscription
price of $42 a set will prevail. Â£'. .
CAPITAL CITY

Coursing Defended Against
Secretary Holbrookes
Attack.
NOT A CRUEL PASTIME.
If the Chasing of Hares Is Pre
vented, the Gun and Rod
Must Also Go.
SACRAMENTO CLUB TO MEET.
Gauntlet Thrown Down to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 6.-The
declaration of Secretary Holbrook that he
would try to put a stop to coursing, on the
ground that it was a violation of the laws
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, has not by any means met
the approval of the members and officials
of the Sacramento Coursing Club, and they
express their opinion of his intentions in
very plain language. Frank Christofelt,
president of the club, said to-day:
"I am ai a loss to see how any one can
be so foolish as to claim that coursing is
a cruel sport, especially whÂ«m it is com
pared with any of the other lines of out
door amusements. The fisherman im
pales a live worm or minnow on his hook
and drags a fish into his boat; he
tears the hook out of its mouth, often
dragging the entrails with it, if the fish
happens to have swallowed the hook;
then he throws the rish into the boat, to
thrash its life away and die in agony.
The hunter in the mountains gets a snap
shot at a deer and cripples it; the animal
escapes into the underbrush and slowly
dies, perhaps from starvation.
"The crack shot at the trap wounds a
pigeon, perhaps with but one grain of shot,"
and then to save his score he slowly crawls
onto the suffering bird and clutches it,
bringing it alive to the jmlges to prove
that at least one grain of shot has hit it.
"In coursing, the dog runs up on the
hare, tosses it into the air, gives one snap
and its life is ended. A hare is an ac
knowledged pest and is destroyed at all
times by the farmers, whose products
they destroy. The fact is ihat if
coursing is to be stopped on the
ground of cruelty, then must all
other sport cease, for in my opinion court
ing is the least cruel of all. Did it ever
strike you that there was never any cry
heard against coursing until the establish
ment of the new coursing park in San
Francisco? This park will simply do
away with the grounds at Newark, as it
can be easily reached by streetcar, while
the other can be reached only by
one early train. Strange, is it not, that
since the establishment of those new
grounds a member of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
should have suddenly discovered that a
sport that has been carried on for at least
1200 years without a murmur is cruel?
"We shall hold a coursing match next
Sunday, and Mr. Holbrook can then have
a chance to pat a stop to the chasing of
hares in Sacramento county by the does
belonging to the members of the Sacra
mento Coursing Club, if he so desires."
Henry Devme, secretary of the club,
said: "Coursing in my opinion is by no
means a cruel sport, for the animal, when
caught by the dogs, is in almost every case
killed instantly. Even should the dog
miss his snap in the first instance and
catch the animal by the leg the second dog
snaps it through the back the next in
stant and ends its life.
"On the other hand, if a sportsman
wounds a bare it runs away and dies a
lingering deatn. Yet how many men out
with a gun but will shoot at a hare when
it jumps up, even thoueh he does not care
to carry it home for food ? All SDort is
more or less cruel.
"The horseman who in a close race down
the stretch beats his horse in the Hopes of
winning even by a hair is cruel, yet for
ages this has been done and there has
never been a murmur. The marksman at
the trao who wounds his bird and leaves
it to slowly bleed to death is cruel.
"In fact all sport may be considered
cruel, but the least cruel of all is coursing.
We do not beat our dogs to make them
run, and they can stop if they tire. If the
doe catches, he kills, and no maimed ani
mals are left to die a lingering death."
Maurice Sheehan, the treasurer of the
club, said he understood that Holbrook's
objections were confined to coursing in
parks. Sheehan gaye as his opinion that
this was even more merciful than coursing
on the plains, for the reason that the hare
bad a chance to escape through the holes in
the fence provided for that purpose, while
on tne plains there were no hiding-places
or barriers that could be passed by the
hare and not by the dog.
Mr. Shehan believes that Secretary Hol
brook has undertaken a big job when he
determined to stop coursing matches. If
coursing is stopped on the ground of cru
elty to animals the shoigun and the fish
ing-rod must also go.
MAXSEN'B FATJS IN DOUBT.
How the Story of HUt Alleged Sueceat
Waa Started.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 6. â
A Herald Bt. Petersburg special says:
At last we have been told the true origin
of the story about Dr. Nansen's discovery
of the north pole. It came from Tomsk
through the merchant Kuschnareff, who
is the uncle of Kandakoff, the originator
of the news. His story is that his nephew
did nothing more than spread the report.
It appean that in the Siberian Islands
there have been three parties in search of
the mammoth bones. One of these parties
returned some time ago and said they had
seen a ship in the neighborhood of toe
islands with Europeaus on board.
They did not attempt any communica
tion with the ship. Kandakoff, to whom
the mammoth hunters brought the hews,
thought it might relate to Nansen, and
wrote thus to Irkutsk, whence it was sent
all over the world.

PARKERSBURG, W. Va., April 6.â
C. J. Baily, a drummer traveling; for
Henking, Boyle & Co., while on a collect
ing trip in the Sistertield oil field a few
months ago, got on a spree with some oil
men, during which he paid $300 for an in

he could not remember what he had done
with his money. He concluded that the
wisest course was silence.
During the past week Baily made an

costed by a stranger, who asked him if his
name was not Baily. The man receiving
an affirmative reply, told Baily he had just
deposited $7500 to Baily's credit in a dank

which had "come in" three weeks ago on

outside with his mount when headed for
home, and as he made his move was lol
lowed by Modestia. The pair soon drew
upon equal terms "With Parthamax, who
had assumed the lead, and a rattling drive
ensued to the stand. As the wire was
nassed Sister Adele was a nose in front of
Modestia, with the Burns & Waterhouse

longs were covered in 52 seconds, an excel

necessary to run the horses with search

not necessary to extract the mud from the
eyes of the jockeys.
The card was a good one, and the at

toe Doodie horse receded to 9 to 5. The
two first choices had things pretty much
their own way to the stretch, the Major

Old Bichard Fishhouse on Gladys

Alterations.
The Olympic Club rowing annex
intends to have a clubhouse at Bel

appointments will be second to none on
the bay. Indeed, it is claimed by some of
the members that the new quarters will
be able to house more boats and will have
a larger number of racing anrl pleasure
boats than any other rowing clubhouse in
or near Pan Francisco.
The Olympic aquatic men have secured
the old Biohard fishhonse, wnich stands
on Gladys Beach, between Belvedere and
Valentines Island, opening into Belvedere
Cove. The Bichard house is a long build
ine, with tenements in the upper story,
and a spacious apartment beneath. The'
upstairs portion will not be used by the
Olympics, as there is ample room in tho
lower part for the purposes of a well
equipped rowing club. This half has
been thoroughly reconstructed, with racks
for boats, with lockers, etc., round the
walls. A high fence which assures privacy
has been built, and now a force of work
men are employed in building a lnndin<*
President Foster of the San Francisco
and North Pacific Kailway has generously
contributed to this portion of the work as
he takes a deep interest in the new club.
The piling for the landing, a consider
able undertaking in itself, is now in pro

It is believed that the Olympic rowing
men'? advent in the placid cove will in
duce other clubs to Jook in that direction
for a rowing course, and that will increase
travel between San Francisco and Tiburon
The Olympics themselves say they have
the best spot on the bay for a course as
the water is well sheltered and affords
every opportunity for good work com

A FAMOUS SPRINTER.
Luther H. Carey, the Ex-Amatour Cham
pion, Arrives From the East.
Luther H. Carey, the famous amateur
sprinter, is in this City, where he proposes
to remain for some time.
Mr. Carey has retired permanently from
the cinder path, and will in future give
his undivided attention to a religious so
ciety of which he is a representative. The
retired sprinter is a graduate of Princeton,
and at one time held the championship of
America at 100-yard racing.
He held the 10-second record for a num
ber of years, and was defeated a few years
ago for the American championship by
Owens in 9 4-5 seconds.
When Carey went to England with the
American team he easily disposed of his
competitor! in the sprints. He also con- â 
tested in Paris at the championships i
and won every race in which
he participated. Very few sprinters I
can boast of as good a record as the ex- j
champion, who says that he will never !
again wear a running shoe and that he has
permanently retired from athletics.
Carey's great race with Ovens is still
fresh in the minds of all amateur sprinters
The men left their marks together at the
cracK of the pistol, and ran' shoulder to
shoulder for ninety yards, when Owens
who was a powerfully built fellow forged'
aheaa and breasted the tape, a winner by
a few feet.
Carey has many friends among the stu
dents and professors of Stanford and
Berkeley universities, who will welcome
him to the land of sunshine and flowers.

A NEW GOLD EXCHANGE
Opened With Eloquence in the
Mills Building Ro
tunda.
RICHES HELD IN RESERVE.
Revival of God-Mining Will Impart
Life and Labor in Other
Fields.
The Gold-Mining Exchange of San
Francisco was formally opened for busi-
WAI.TER TtRNBULL, PRESIDENT OF THE NEW GOLD EXCHANGE.
ness yesterday. To signalize the event
many representative citizens were invited
to assemble in the rotunda of the Mills
building at 11 a. m. and at the hour ap
pointed the large space reÂ«erved for the
audience was Tilled with interested listen-
Promptly at the time designated Walter
Turnbuil. president of the exchange,
opened the proceedings. He spoke of the
banding together of fifty men engaged in
all elapses of legitimate business and pledg
ing to assist in promoting gold mining in
California and elsewhere. He believed
there never was a time in California's his
tory where such an opportunity was pre
sented as the present for combined effort
in the development of our gold mines. "Our
hills are overrun with prospectors who
are bringing back the most glowing re
ports and beeeing for capital to develop
their finds. Thus has the necessity arisen,
and for this reason are we here to-day. to
inaugurate our exchange, which will brine
together the honest miner and the man of
capital.
"We need something to shake us out of
the lethargy that has possessed us so
long, and we need it right now. In my
MAJOR D. E. MILES, TREASURER OF THE NEW GOLD EXCHANGE.
opinion, California is on the eve of the
greatest mining prosperity the world has
ever known. Few of us are really aware
how very near it is.
"If the miner had had the advantage of
the same number of millions of dollars
which the banker has advanced to the
farmer, fruit-grower, vinevardist and
home-builder during so many years,
would not California have been in the
midst of prosperity now?
"But the needy miner was never civen a
hearing; he was treated as a tramp, and
his story considered a Munchausen tale.
"But these conditions have changed and
the money is now seeking the miner, and
this exchange has set out to bring them
together.
"We want to see a mining boom. We
want to sec money made to put up more
buildings like this in which we now stand.
We have seen enough vacant stores and
offices and enough poverty. We want a
little new blood, even if it strides fever
heat once in a while, and we want to give
some of the present generation a chance to
become heav.v, respectable and affluent
citizens, who shall have made their money
while the fever was on."
Irving M. Scott next addressed the audi
ence. He had seen the wonderful exam
ples of energy and the large development
of wealth due to the enterprise of the hon
est miner. Touching on the financial
questions of the hour, he remarked that
the issue had been reduced to coin vs.
paper, to bullion vs. bonds.
tteferring to Dumas' fiction of "Monte
Crirto," he remarked that the tropical
imagination of the author had fancied
$80,000,000 as the fable of wealth. That
was the dream of the richest imagination
of 1844. Yet in our day two of the mines
of the l Comstock lode produced $150,000,
--000. The dream of '44 was the fact of '77.
The story of what may be accomplished
by the revival of gold mining in California
cannot be told. The deeper you go the
richer becomes the yield.
The transformation in San Francisco
when $1,000,000 a month was distributed
in dividends was marvelous. We have
not wholly lost the force of that splendid
feeling. The treat buildings of San Fran
cisco attest in a measure the wealth pro
duced by the mine*.
Mr. Scott estimated that $400, 000,000 in
gold still remained in the United States,
but acknowledged that vast sums of the
treasure, owing to our system of finance,
had gone out of the country. It was the
opinion of the speaker that California re
quired development rather than popula
tion, rlvery man owning a transportation
line or a vast tract of land wanted more
people to carry and more purchasers of
land. What we need is the extension of
opportunity for labor. The miner in the
pursuit of his calling requires many arti
cles of merchandise. He must have his
house to dwell in. and so a market is
created for lumber. He must have ma
chinery, so worn is given to the manufac
turer.
"Gold and silver mining," said Mr.
Scott, "is the very basis of prosperity
when honestly administered." The in
dustry Droduces not on!y the necessities or
life, but the luxuries. For the edification
of General Turnbuil, the speaker made in
cidental reference to French dinnersâ a
cold bottle and a hot bird.
Recurring to the subject of the life which
mining imparted to other industries, Mr.
Scott said: "Go to the Union Iron Works
to-day and you will see a room 21f> feet
square crowded with mining machinery
for California, Mexico, Arizona, Montana
and Utah. The quantity is vastly greater
than the works ever had in the palmist
days of the past. Instead of 300 men on
the payroll, as in the old mining days, we
hafe now 2000. What keeps these 2000
men employed? It is their ability to get
their pay for an honest day's work. What
limit can you have to your prosperity if
you take out $2 a day when only $1 a day
was formerly taken?
Scarcely had the applause following Mr.
Scott's speech subsided, when President
Turnlmll introduced Hugh Craig, presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce. He
began by translating the motto ol San
Francisco renderi ng it "Gold in peace ana
in war iron." He did not hold to the
opinion that the advancement of agricult
ure meant the decadence of mining. When
wheat is selling at a cent a pouna, and
other productions of the farm proportion
ately low, there was no good encourage
ment for agriculture. In the development
of California, mines only the surface has
been prospected. Within a very few years
mining will become so important that
every detail will be on a scientific basis.
In closing, Mr. Craig paid a compliment
to the ability and patience displayed by
Walter Turnbull in the organization of the
exchange. He also extended the good
wishes of the Chamber of Commerce f o
the prosperity of the new institution.
John Daggett, vice-president of the ex
change ana superintendent of the United
States Mint, spoke as a practical mining
man of forty years' experience. He as
serted that the institution of the Gold
Mining Exchange was organized for a
Diirpose as important as any that had ever
been inaugurated in California. Mining
was the true home industry that should
De encouraged. It was the source of un
failing wealth, as you find scales in all
parts of the world to give you the value of
the product.
The object of the association was not to
induce speculation. If that had been the
purpose he would not have joined. It did
propose to stive security to investors who
knew nothing of mining. He traced the
discouragement of the mining industry,
which was often caused by placing the
management of mining property in the
hands of ignorant and incompetent men.
When mining is justly treated p.s a legiti
mate industry it will meet with as much
success as any other calling derives.
The mining industry creates wealth.
The building in which we are assembled
was erected by D. O. Mills, who made his
start in Tuolumne County by selling
water to the miners. The first" million
dollar draft ever drawn in California came
from the mines, and was drawn by John
Gashwiier.
Mr. Daggett quoted statistics prepared
by Charles Yale, statistician of tne Mint,
showing that last year m California 14,000
miners produced $*l"i,000,000. He asked if
any other industry could equal such pro
duction.
Colonel P. T. Dickinson made the clos
ing remarks, introducing, as he said, a
little sentiment. Observing that time,
proverbially made lor slaves, was also
made for sovereigns, he produced a beau
tiful watch and presented the timepiece to
General Turnbuli.
The president of the exchange accepted
the eitt and expressed the hope that the
institution so opened would never close,
but would live to be quoted as mining au
thority in the capitals of London, Paris
and Berlin.
The officers of the newly opened ex
change are: President, Walter Turnbuli ;
vice-president, John Daggett; treasurer,
D. E. Miles; secretary, J. P. Crosett.
BOTH SIDES WILL FIGHT
Strained Situation of the Strike
on the Parrott
Building.
Unions of the Council Instruct Their
Delegates Not to Let the Men
Go Back.
The building trades' strike against the
Parrott building has reached a decidedly
interesting, as well as a strained, situa
tion. The superintendent announces that
he will not delay the work another day,
and if to-day the affair is not settled he
will get men from any source and put
them to work in the strikers' places.
The council and the unions it represents
are equally determined not to yield, and it
is pro Dosed to carry the tight on to the
bitter end if the job is not unionized. The
council's delegates say they are satisfied
that the Eruschke contract could be
broken by those in authority if they
wished to do so and at no loss to the
estate.
Several small jobs were struck by the
business agenta yesterday. There is no
change in the situation of the painters'
strike.
WILL NOT GIVE IN.
The Building Trades Council Is De
termined to Unionize the Bl?
Parrott Bulldlnr
A long meeting of the Building Trades
Council was held last evening. The busi
ness agents presented reports upon the
strike and its progress. H. M. Saunders
stated that he nad unionized a mixed job
on Second avenue. He had also ordered
a walkout on a mixed job on Fell and
Scott streets, where non-union men were at
work. On Twenty-fifth and Folsom
streets he had found a job where a
number of lathers were at work who had
formed a union of their own outside of
the Building Trades Council. He gave
the regular union men orders to strike the
job if the outsiders continued to work.
The report was made that the reason the
members of the Electrical Workers' Union
on the Parrott building did not walk out
was because the union is virtually under
the control of electricians who are in the
employ of an iron manufacturing firm and
a streetcar electric railroad. It is likely
that a new union that will affiliate with
the council will be organized.
It was decided to publish a manifesto
stating to the public the causes of the
strike, and particularly the strike on the
Parrott building.
A report was made tnat Bmschke of the
furniture company is organizing a "union"
among his workmen on the profit-sharing
principle.
A communication was received from
Carpenters' and Joiners' Union No. 483
stating the attitude of the union on the
Parrott job and read. It appears elsewhere
in this issue.
The delegates from the Wood and Furni
ture Union announced that that body will
hold an open meeting to-night at 1159 Mis
sion street, to which all of that craft
union and non-unionâ have been invited.
Apents Saunders and Mclvor stated the
position that the superintendent of the
Parrott building had taken relative to the
men returning to work. The council de
cided not to back down from the position
already taken to unionize the building if
it is possible. Further efforts will be made
to-day to bring about a settlement that
will relieve the strike on the building.
WILL RESUME WORK.
Superintendent Stanford Says
There Will Be No Further Delay
In the Parrott Block.
M. E. Stanford, the superintendent of the
Parrott building, has determined that the
work delayed two days by the Building
Trades' strike shall not be delayed any
longer. In discussing the labor troubles
in which the job is involved he said in sub
stance :
So far the strike has not been a very serious
drawback, to us. It has given several depart
ments an opportunity to catch up with their
work. The building is too nearly completed
now to permit further delay. I have nothing
against trades unions, but I feel that this strike
is unjust. It called out several hundred men
because of a disagreement with one contractor
Mr. Bruschke, who only employs a small force
of men. Now, we have no control over Mr.
Bruschke, as he has a contract to perform cer
tain work, and it does not matter to him
whether or not the entire building is tied up
He will fulfill his contract in spite of all that
can be done. He will be here about two
weeks longer. Is it reasonable to have all of
the other work stopped by a strike until he
gets through? While his men stay with him
he can go right along without interruption
and when he is finished the union men can
come back. Thac seems to be the situation
from the union standpoint.
From the other side, my position, I must say
that this cannot be done. The work will have
to go on, union or no union. The Emporium
Company expect to occupy the first and
second floors of the building some time be
tween the 15th and 30th of this montn We
will begin at once to move goods into the
northeast corner, facing on Market street at
once.
What I propose to do is this: Give the men
who were ordered out an opportunity to re
turn and complete the work that many of
them began a year or so ago. I would prefer
that the old hands should return, but if they
will not then I will get anybody who desires
to go to work.
I will give the men until to-morrow (Tues
day) to decide what they intend to do. There
will be no trouble in tilling the building with
competent workmen in all lines, and if we
cannot get the men we want we will have to
take the men we can get, but there will be no
further delay in the work on this building.
I wish that tiic matter could be settled, and I
hope that it will be without any further|an
noynnce. While it is true that "the innocent
frequently suffer with the guilty, in this case
there are ;too many innocent men who are
suffering.
Mr. Stanford stated that neither the
plumbers nor the electrical workers left
the building yesterday morning, as ex
pected.
Mr. Kerns, the contractor, who has sev
eral contracts in the building, is very de
sirous that tne ditticulty should be settled
without further annoyance. When the
strike was ordered about 100 of his men
walked out, and only a few loremen and
apprentices are at work.
In speaking of the superintendent's ufti
matum, he said that while he had no wish
to clash with the union, still if the super
intendent directed that the work be re
sumed he would be obliged to resume
operations with the best men he could
secure. He says that there ;ire plenty of
men on the market who will be only'too
glad to work in the places left by those
who walked out. As soon as he receives
the order from the suDerintendent he will
resume operations.
Carpenters' Union No. 483.
At the meeting of Carpenters' Union
No. 483, last night, the delegates to the
Building Trades Council were instructed
to notify the council to unionize the work
men in the Parrott building and directed
to see that if this he not accomplished to
f<ay all unions be kept off the build
ing and that a boycott be declared on the
building, the boycott to be indefinite as to
duration.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The Easter bonnet will have a better
show next Sunday.
Congress has spoken and we shall now
ace what Spain is going to do about it.
Mr. Harrison is wiseâ a honeymoon in
April ia better than a campaign all summer.
Congress has called the President on the
Cuban question and he must make a show
down.
The refunding scheme takes many forms
and i: also aims to take everything else
it can.
Huntington may be as big a boss as ever,
but somehow of late his jobs seem to be
too big for him.
There are no longer any bosses visible in
tli9 Republican partyâ the leaders have
come to the front.
The Republican party is in control of the
political circus, but Democracy i* furnish
ing the menagerie.
In baiting his hook for an indorsement
Carlisle evidently hopes to catch a Presi
dential nomination.
The political frying-pan has at last be
come hot enough to make Democracy get
a squirming move on.
As tins is expected to be a quiet week in
politics we may as well prepare for a roar
to break out somewhere.
Boies has about concluded to reconsider
the thing if the Democratic nomination is
offered him on a silver plate.
While Congress is interested in foreign
affairs it hail better Te-enact the law pro
viding for reciprocity treaties.
Resolutions in favor of Cuba are good as
far as they go, but as a matter of fact Cuba
has enough resolution of her oÂ»n.
There may be gold in Alaska and Death
Valley, but for the average citizen it is
safest to hunt for it somewhere else.
Instead of standing for anything this
year the Democratic party will pass the
campaign Bitting down on its record.
The San Diego World may be correct in
saying the State division movement is not
dead, but it must admit that it is para
lyzed.
If Bradley is wise he will limit his boom
to the Vice-Presidency and call out the
National Guard of Kentucky to head off
his fool friends.
As a substitute for Cleveland in tbe
coming campaign Carlisle would be just as
satisfactory to the public a? anj' other man,
except the boss himself.
When Kainey comes bark and gets his
department working the aspirine Mr.
Lanigan will have his choice of taking
water or being fired out.
There are so many funding bills crop
ping up in Congress it would be hard to
keep track of them all if it were not that
all of them follow the same trail and head
for the same end.
The only way for San Francisco to keep
up with the city extension movement
that prevails elsewhere is to start a move
ment for a cheaper and better streetcar
service to the suburbs.
The festival spirit in San Jose has set
business to moving, and she is now talk
ing of building a grand opera-house
where she can be gay and have a good
show all the year round.
Democratic aspirants for the Presidency
who are holding back this year in the hope
of setting the nomination in 1900 are not
so far-sighted as they think themselves.
There may be no Democratic party by that
time.
The Roentgen ray has been brought into
court as a witness to show the amount of
damage done to a man's bones by a rail
road accident, and at last we seem to have
expert testimony that will be worth some
faing.
The rule of the Interstate Commerce
Commission that railroads have a right to
haul imported goods cheaper than home
goods can be proven to be a good rule only
by turning it round and making it work
the other way.
Colorado Democrats, having nothing else
to fight about, have begun scalping one
another over a proposition to invite Till
man to come out and make a speech to
them, and in the meautime Tillman has
never said whether he would come or not.
In each festival count}- the contest at
present is not so much to decide which
woman shall be queen of beauty as to de
termine which one of the many queens of
beauty in the county shall he trumps when
the joyous game opens during the festival
week.
The statement in Congress that in the
last sLy months over 120U illicit distilleries
have been seized and destroyed in this
country shows the extent to which that
kind ol traffic is carried on, and proves
toere must be pretty good profits in moon
shine.
Those who are interested in Democratic
possibilities might as well keep a casual
watch on Governor Matthew&oi Indiana.
The stalwart Yoorheea is said to be going
about telling the silver men that his friend
the (ioveruor is their ideal candidate for
the Presidential race.
THE FUNDING AGEEEMENT.
The last news from Washington is that
the joint sub -committee of the Senate and
House Committees on Pacific Roads has
accepted and agreed to report to the re
spective houses of Congress the bill already
outlined in these columns, with this modi
fication: The annual pai'inent on the
principal for the first' ten years is. raised
iroxn $300,000 to $365,000 a year. The an
nual payment for the succeeding ten years
is to be $500,000; after that the annual pay
ment is to be $750,000 until the debt is ex
tinguished. The familiar features of mak
ing the impact interest a part cf the debt
and funding the whole at a rate of 2 per
cent are retained. The scheme applies to
both the Union and Central Pacific lines,
and in the case of the Central Pacific the
Southern Pacific is made responsible.
In this shape the bill will be reported to
both housed in a few days. Its grossly un
fair character is so well understood on
this coast that nothing can be said which
might prove instructive to the people here.
The one hope is that the presentation of
this bill will lead to such a ventilation of
the matter in. the Senate and the House as
will lead to the final defeat of the dis
graceful measure. Mr. Huntington is by
no means in sight of victory, and the peo
ple of California still may cherish a hope
that this great Nation will preserve its in
tegrity and give consideration to the im
portance of this State.
The job which the Southern Pacific has
so deftly manipulated to shut out an ap
propriation for San Pedro harbor should
be a sufficient indication to Congress of the
policy of this powerful corporation. The
spectacle of the National legislature serving
the interest of a private corporation at the
expense of principles so vital to the whole
country is not a pleasant thing to contem
plate. The explanation that the Eastern
States cannot comprehend the gravity of
the matter will not lessen the burdens
which it is proposed to place upon us nor
diminish the harm which the precedent
will wprk. The ignorance of Eastern sen
timent can be dispelled in great measure
by the California delegation in Congress.
Such an opportunity to make a brilliant
record comes rarely, and California will
expect its representatives to do their duty.
CUBAN KESOLUTIONS.
The Senate and House have passed a
joint resolution recognizing the belliger-
ency of the Cubans, and thus in a sense
throw the gauntlet to Spain, which
may be expected to take it up with
out a moment's hesitation. As the resolu
tion is concurrent, the President may or
may not tell Congress what bethinks of it,
as he pleases; with reference to its pur
pose, he may exercise a similar discretion.
In other words, the resolution is not a com
plete recognition of the belligerent rights
of the Cuban insurgents. That matter re
mains as fully in the hands of the Presi
dent now a3 it was before the resolution
was adopted. It amounts to no more as a
National policy than would a similar reso
lution by a National convention of dele-
gates representing all clashes and called for
the purpose of expressing the American
sentiment.
As this is a republic, and a? the wishes
of the people are represented, formulated
and enforced by persons selected for that
purpose, the action of Congress may be
construed as an expression of the American
wish that the Cuban insurgents should be
given a fair chance in the struggle which
they are making. It remains for President
Cleveland to s,ay whether in bis calm judg
ment this is best not only for the United
States, but also for the principles lepre
sente4 by their union. This is not a light
task for him to assail. As the chief execu
tive of the people, he is charged with re
sponsibilities immeasurably greater than
any resting upon a private citizen. In the
discharge of these he is required to possess
a range of information covering everything
that in its operation makes this Govern
ment possible.
The aggressive side of Mr. Cleveland's
character has had a curiously divided
manifestation and this fact raises an ele
ment of uncertainty in regard to guesses
of his conduct in the present emergency.
When the Venezuelan question was raised
he shouted defiance at England and yet
he continued to accept the financial and
tariff policy of England as his guerdon
and depended on English capitalists rep
resented by Pierpont Morgan to buy the
bonds which he caused to be issued to
cover the export of American gold to
England. Again, he had not a word to
say when Embassador Bayard violated all
the ethics of diplomacy and incurred the
censure of Congress by making Democratic
free-trade speeches in England. These
curious inconsistencies render idle all
speculation with regard to his probable
course under the concurrent resolution
of Congress concerning the recognition of
Cuban belligerency. Perhaps our Demo
cratic contemporaries may be able to make
an intelligent prognosis of Mr. Cleveland's
case. We shall await these disclosures
with an acute interest.
REDWOOD TO EUEOPE.
It has taken a long time for Europe to
discover the beauty of the California red
wood for the interior decoration of houses,
but England has at last made the dis
covery and is loading ships at San Fran
cisco with the lumber. It is sent in tbe
form of thick, broad slabs, presumably
green, and is to be worked up in the de
sired forms by English artisans.
The more familiar Englishmen become
with the strange qualities and uncommon
beauty of this remarKable wood, the more
abundantly will they order it. They will
probably make a great many blunders in
handling it before they have learned its
peculiarities, but wisdom will come with
experience. They will learn that, unlike
all other woods, its shrinkage in drying is
longitudinal rather than transverse: that
while it is very light when dry, it is exceed
ingly heavy when green; that though
soft, it dulls edged tools rapidly, being in
the latter regard different from all other
coniferous lumber, and that it splits easily
and in straight lines. If it is not
thoroughly dried before working, it loses
the smoothness left by the plane, but once
well dried, it can be easily given a surface
as smooth and as easily polished as ma
hogany. In color it resembles that wood
more than any other, and though not so
deep and rich, has a softness of tone that
no other wood can equal. Under varnish,
it looks bold and harsh, while careful
hand-finishing gives it a gentle luster of in
comparable beauty.
Afier our English cousins have learned
the beauties and peculiarities of straight
redwood they will seek the wonderful
pieces of wood that lie in the base of the
tree. This is called burl. Timothy Hop
kins has the finest collection of this for
mation that exists, and at all the fairs
where it has been exhibited it has at
tracted eager attention. In the burl the
ordinary straight grain of the tree is com
pressed into a tangled mass of twisted and
interlocked lines and has great density
and hardness and a rich, deep color. It is
susceptible of a polish equal to that of
glass, and this reveals its remarkable dis
torted texture. Transverse sections made
into table tops are surpassingly handsome.
The introduction of redwood into Eng
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 1896.
land will be followed by ft demand for it
throughout Europe. This makes it timely
for us to consider the wise use and con
servation of the redwood forests of the
State. As the tree exists nowhere else in
the world we have here a treasure of ines
timable value, and although the tree will
grow in many parts of the world if planted
it will be thousands of years before it can
have attained a size equal ;to that of the
California trees. It ig an exceedingly for
tunate fact that the reawood easily repro
duces itself by suckers and that it is very
difficult, except by the persistent intro
duction of rire, to exterminate a forest.
The development of American forestry
should include the propagation of this
handsomest as well as most useful of trees
and its extensive planting in its native
home, California.
WHEEE PROSPERITY BEGINS.
It may not be far from the truth to
assume that the current high rate of taxa
tion in San Francisco was necessary to
cure in part some of the gross errors which
have been committed in the past. An
analysis of the expenditures required to
overcome the evils of fraudulent contract
work in the construction of pavements
ana sewers might be made to show that
the City is now required justly to suffer
for an inexcusably lax management of
public affairs under old conditions. These
were the result of corrupt boss rule. What
ever may be the right or wrong of the
present burdensome tax, no intelligent
citizen will deny the fact that it is emi
nently deserved. Hardly a month passes
without a discovery that a street has been
improperly paved, that sewers have been
laid to drain up hill, or that either the
municipality or private owners have
been swindled, live are paying for all this
now in the shape of an onerous tax.
Patching is an expensive indulgence.
Magee's Real Estate Circular for March
indirectly calls attention to this matter.
After noting a normal demand for fine
business property, it declares that buyers
expect to secure it at low prices, ana then
says: "Net rates of interest that are quite
unattainable in other equally safe securi
ties are expected from real estate. Buyers
insist, too, in their calculations of income,
on reckoning as high a rate of taxation
continuously as that which disgraced the
City and State last year and from which
real estate has not yet begun to recover. "
This simply means to say that a betrayal
of public trust and a squandering of public
funds affected the value of every man's
property in the City. A great part of the
work accomplished by recent grand juries
has been the discovery of incompetency
and fraud in the execution of public im
provements.
Thanks to a recently awakened public
spirit the end of this order of things seems
within reach. The money that has been
recklessly squandered under former ad
ministrations would have made just such
improvements as are now so greatly need
ed had it been honestly and intelligently
expended. San Francisco is still a young
city, and must be supposed to have com
mitted serious blunders to retard its prog-
ress. Recently it has become so alert to
its importance and so quickened under
contact with the forces which are moving
the Nation onward that a realization of its
shortcomings in the past is causing
poignant regrets. The search now is for
the guilt}-. This gives every intelligent
citizen an opportunity to stand up and
plead as his conscience may dictate, and
to make earnest resolutions for the future.
DEMANDS OP SAN PEDEO.
There can be no doubt remaining in the
mind of any one who is sincerely de
sious of knowing whether Santa Monica
or San Pedro should be given Government
aid for harbor improvement. That the
sentiment of the people of Los Angeles,
the city most interested in the matter, is
virtually unanimous for San Pedro has al
ways been understood by the people of the
entire State, but the situation has cvi-
dently not been so well known at Wash
ington, or else the committee having the
matter in hand has allowed itself to be
governed by the wishes of C. P. Hunting-
So far the committee has decided to re
port no appropriation for either, owing to
the contest made before it by representa
tives of the two places named. A com
promise has been proposed whereby both
places shall receive appropriations, and,
rather than lose that for San Pedro the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce has
virtually agreed to the deal, under pro
test, of course, by winch C. P. Hunting
ton will be enabled with Government
money to build himself a harbor at Santa
Monica in order to make more profitable
his railroad property there.
But the industrial classes take a more
determined stand and declare in favor of a
harbor for San Pedro alone or nothing. In
a telegram sent to Senator White and Con
gressman McLachlan the labor unions ask
support for an appropriation for the im
provement of San Pedro harbor and "op
position to the efforts of a monopoly to
secure the improvement of its harbor by
Government funds at Santa Monica."
That Congress will be able to find a con
sistent excuse for ignoring the well-defined
wishes of the people seems impossible.
Whether it will do so and obey the be
hests of Huntington will be a matter that
will be watched with intense interest by
the people of the Pacific Coast.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Leonard S. Calkins, editor and proprietor of
the well-known journal, the Nevada City
Transcript, and ex-Postmaster at Nevada City,
is among the arrivals at the Lick. He is ac
companied by Mrs. Calkins. They are here. for
a few days' stay, and are enjoying themselves
meeting oid friends.
Mr. Calkins was born at Nevada City, as was
also his wife, but the editor has not spent the
whole of his life there. He went East in his
youth, and at Cleveland, Ohio, began his news
paper career. After being there a few years he
returned to Nevada City. There for a long time
he has been running the Transcript.
Editor Calkins tells an interesting story of
the thrift of Nevada City and surrounding
places, because of the additional work in the

"There are a number of things under way
there." said Mr. Calkins, "that promise well

mine, which has for a long time had thirty
stamps running, has now about completed
forty more. Twenty of the new stamps, as a
matter of fact, and the thirty established
long ago are now running, making fifty going,
and in a little while there will be twenty
more, or Beventy altogether.
"Besides this the Provideuee mine will soon
probably add forty more stamps to the forty it
now has. Other mines are proposing to enlarge
their capacities in one way or another and in
crease their output.
"A company of men from Virginia City have
obtained a bond for two years on the Chap

well, but it is understood they are satisfied
with the mine in every way and will take it.

"Tlie most important thing iv Nevada

that in the next year or two there will be an

MARY ANDERSON'S MEMORIES.
She Talks op Heb Fisot Appkahance in San
Francisco.
My appearance in San Francisco at John
MeCullough'g theater soon followed, and was
the most unhappy part;of my professional life.
With but few exceptions the members of the
numerous company continually ridiculed my
work. My poor wardrobe was a subject of
special sport to the gorgeously dressed women, i
and unkindly remarks about the "interloper"
were heard on every side. The press cut me
up, or ruther tried to cut me down, advising
me to leave the stage. Continual taunts from
actors and journalists neaily broke my spirit.
I slept but little, and then only toward morn
ing, from the exhaustion of weeping all the
night. There was no one with whom I could
share these sufferings, for pride kept me from
hinting my real state of mind by word or look,
pven, to my mother. The effort to smile and
seem hopeful before others was as wearying as
the giving vent to sorrow and humiliation
when aloae. The engagement, with the ex
ception of the last two nights, had come to an
end, .when "Meg llerrilies" was given and re
ceived with genuine enthusiasm by actors and
public. But this success came too late. Only
one night remained, and I could not hope to
retrieve Jor Mr. McCullough all I had lost for
mm. I-orthe ltvst performance I played Par
thema for the first time to his Ingomar. This
was also highly successful.â From "An Act

A STEVENSON SHRINE.
The literary world appears to have conceded
to San Francisco the privilege and honor of
erecting a Stevenson shrine. This seems to be
agreed upon by all who love the memory of
Robert LouU Stevenson, and it includes all who
speak the English language. A band of de
voted souls recently suggested the erection of
a drinking fountain near the edge of the Latin
quarter, in which neighborhood he lived while
among us.
Several designs have been proposed, but none
that the Supervisors of the City and County of
San Francisco deemed adequately artistic and
suggestive of the genius whose memory they
evidently revere. It speaks well for the literary
elevation of the community when even the
public office-holders have so much apprecia
tion of this master in the world of letters.
The delay in putting up the fountain instead
of discouraging has emboldened the Stevenson
devotees and they have decided to put forth
even greater efforts to secure a fitting monu-

ment. The words of encouragement wafted
across the continent, and oven from far off
yet sympathetic England, have led our people
to hope for more generous contributions and a
more expensive bronze than was at first con
templated.
In v recent number of the London Sketch
Emily Soldene gives a description of what w&a
known as Mr. Doxey's Stevenson window,
which for a time attracted attention on Market
street. In this article the writer breathes the
sentiment which appears to be so general,
namely, that Stevenson belongs to Sun Fran
cisco more than to any other American city,
and more than to any British city, except it be
that fortunate city in Scotland where he first
saw the light.
The local committee is about to renew its
work of securing funds, and when this effort is
earnestly undertaken there will be expressed a
willingness to accept Eastern and European
contributions in consonance with the spirit so
heartily expressed in those quarters:
Walter Blackbnrn Harte recently wrote of
"that sacred isle, the only one of im
portance in the Pacific; the second one
to the left after leaving San Francisco," and
predicted that it would in years become a
mecca for those whose souls are attuned to the
true and beautiful in nature and art. It is the
object of those Stevennonians who live on
this eastern edge ot the majestic ocean which
surrounds his grave to erect here a shrine
which may serve as a preparatory chapel for
such pilgrims hs may cross "miles o'er the
ridges of the rolling sea" to pay their devo
tions to the memory of the dead magician.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE SILVER FORCES ENROLL.
Enlisting for the V?ar to Save Home and
Country.
To the Editor of the Â»SaÂ»i Francisco Callâ Sik:
A higher order of courage than that which
sustains silver men in bo)h the old parties, as
well as in the ranks of the People's party, has
not often been disclosed in the pages of his
tory. With what are they canironted? The

force compared to the subtle world-enfolding,

of trade. The farmers of to-day know far more
of finance and the causes of business depression
and industrial stagnation than the shrewd
"business men," as they complacently regard
themselves, who are engaged in tradeâ that is
in buying and selling the products of other
men engaged in the slavish work of produc

shrewd and pushing "business men," are the

crisis without a parallel in the history of our
As one witness of National standing for in

of the gold standard system of finance, who

or designing to intimate any expression of
sympathy with Popullsta and silverites byac

ence of the money power, let Un ted States
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts take the stand
and repeat what he said In his really great,
humane and manly speech in the Senate Feb
ruary 20, when he pleaded for the interven
tion of our Government on behalf of the
Armenians, the unprotected victims of Turk
ish fanaticism and ferocity. In explanation of
the apparent indifference of England to the
atrocities of the Turks against the Armenian
Christians, in the fervor of feeling tie made
this unwise and damaging admission: "But,
Mr. President, Lord Salisbury obeys a stronger
force, a mightier will than his own. In the
last resort the power which controls in Europe
is the great power of money and the money
lender." This autocrat of Europe, "the great
powerof money," which reigns over all the
Governments of Europe, "does not care," Mr.
Lodge tells us, "how many Armeniaus are
butchered," but he adds, "It does care very
much that nothing shall be done to impair
values," and-* 'if England moved to rescue the
wretched Armenians Ottoman bonds might
decline."
It is this money power that "rules the court,
the camp," the commerce and industry of Eu
rope, and that controls the President, the Con
gress, the Supreme Court, the great newspa
pers, magazines, universities and colleges, as
well as boards of trade, chambers of com

railroad corporations of the United States, and

and patriotic allies, the .silver men, have dared
to confront aud to meet in battle at the ballot
box next November; and they will wage a re
lentless warfare, fired with a holy ardor to de

high resolve to secure and perpetuate better
conditions for their children aud coming gen

nal justice which is the basis of the cause they
have espoused, and sustained by their faith in

to the issue of such contest, for even the stars
in their courses will fight against this gold god
of the money power as -of oid they fought

arms and abundantly supplied with ammuni
tion, including silver bullets that never miss
their mark, and which no magical influence
can ever turn aside. Populists and silver
volunteers are coming in from every quarter.
Ihe manufacturers begin to realize what ii
means for the gold power to rule the country,
and they are rallying to the silver , standard in
large numbers, those only holding back who,
as a strenuous newspaper advocate of silver
has suggested, "are under pressure" of the
money power on which their business is de
pendent for "accommodations." But even
those who are "under pressure" can vote their
convictions in November.
Within a few days a mighty host, numbering
more than two millions, made up of working
men, have declared ior free coinage of silver
and ior union with the silver forces, through
their leaders at a meeting in Chicago which in
cluded all the great labor organizations of the
country, and they are enlisted to do active and
vigorous campaign work in all the large cities
of the Union. Debs, .Gorapera. Sovereign
Hayes, McÃride, Arthur, Trenor, McUuire,
Robinson, Sargent and Arnold inaugurated
this grand movement of ihe toilers March 21,

silver forces are enlisting for the war to* save
home and country. The line of battle is drawn

THE ALASKA GOLD FEVER.
It Has Drawn Into Its Net All
Sorts and Conditions
of Men.
VESSELS BEING FITTED OUT.
A Co-operative Company Will Spend
Two Winters in the Emma
and Louisa. â¢
The gold fever seems to have come to
stay. Every vessel that sails for Alaska
is crowded with miners, and others are
rushing over each other in their eagerness
to get accommodation on the vessels "up
and loading." The news that mea cannot
get to their destination because of lack of
means does not seem to deter any one.
Returned travelers say that Sitka and
Juneau are crowded with men who can
neither get accommodations nor work, and
that huts have been built on the beach to
accommodate those who have no means of
livelihood. This seems to have no effect
on those who have made ud their minds
to go, and the rush continues.
The most sensible scheme yet planned is
that of the owners of the schooner Emma
The Schooner Emma and Louisa, Which Will Take a Party of Co-operative Miners to Cooks Inlet.
The Sketch Shows Her in the Japan Sea as She Appeared When the Three Lost Boats Were
Getting Back When the Fog Lifted. .
[Drawn from a sketch made by Captain Dan McLean.]
and Louisa. There are thirty of them and
they have formed .a joint stock concern
known as the Emma and Louisa Gold
mining and Development Company. Each
man has put tip $250. The venture will be
strictly co-operative, and any individual
discovery of a gold-bearing ledge will re
sult to the advantage of all. The vessel
will be used as a basis of operations, and
with thirty men in the field the new ven
ture siiould prove to be a success.
The schooner is being fitted out at Fol
aom bulkhead 2. She will take a full
supply of provisions to last twelve months
and a number of mules to be used by the
prospecting parties. From here they will
go to Cooks Inlet, and, on arriving at the
point decided upon, the vessel will be
beached and turned into a storeship and
lodging-house. The miners will be turned
into gangs of three each, and will spread
all over the country, returning to the gen
eral headquarters "at stated intervals. If
the miners tail to locate a payable reef
this year the vessel will be headed for
Sitka, where a full supply of provisions
will be put in, and then another attempt
will be made next year. The men are all
sanguine, an. , if there is an abundance of
cold in the Alaskan wilds, they have cer
tainly taken the most feasible "plan of get
tine at it.
The Emma and Louisa will go out in
command of Captain Anderson. He is one
of the best-known masters on the coast
and was lor years in command of the
steamer Humboldt. While on the latter
he was thrown against the rail by a Riant
wave and is only now finally recovered
from the effects of his injuries. The ves
sel herself has seen a number of changes.
She was first of all a center-board yacht,
but was afterward turned into a sealer. A
keel was put on her and under the flag of
C. D. Lada did remarkably well. When
the latter got into difficulties the Emma
and Louis* and the Lily L were sold by
the United States Marshal and purchased
by Ross <fe Hewlett.
Under the new flag both schooners did
fairly well, but the crew of the Emma and
Louisa had an experience on the first voy
age that they will never forget. Captain
Dan McLean was in command of the
schooner and he was determined to make
a good â¢â .! trh.
Off the Japan coast seals were plentiful
and all the boats were sent out. A storm,
accompanied by very thick weather, came
up and the boats got lost. In order to
keep them from drifting the three men in
each boat made a drag out of the sealskins
they had taken. These attracted the
sharks, and when daylight came the boats
were surrounded by tne voracious mon
sters. The skins were cast adrift, and then
the sharks, after devouring them, turned
their attention to the boats. For two days
and two nights they followed the boats,
and time and again tlie men half fasci
nated by the sharKs and half crazy from
lack of food and water had to be restrained
from jumping overboard. Three boats got
back to tlie Emma and Louisa, but the
fourth was nev^r heard from again. Cap
tain Dan McLean was always of tlie opin
ion that the three men were devoured by
the sharks.
Ross <fe Hewlett have now parted with
i the schooner, and her next venture will be
to the Alaskan gold fields. There will be
no fear of dangers on sea, but the men will
have to look out for the land sharks.
Many a good mine has been "jumped"
after mouths of toil have been spent in
locating it.
In the next berth to the Emma and
Louisa is the bark Theobald. She also is
getting ready for a voyage to Alaska, and
Captain Swan expects to have at least
seventy miners as passengers. He is one
of the most experienced navigators sailing
out of San Francisco, and if landing the
venturesome ones on the nearest landing
to tne El Dorado is what is wanted be is
the man that can accomplish the job.
From San Francisco tlie Theobald will
go to Coal Bay, where she will land twenty
miners for the North Pacific Mining and
Transportation Company, and also a quan
tity of machinery, mules and horses.
This outfit will mine for black diamonds.
From Coal Bay the Theobald will go to
Turnagain Bay, where the gold miners
will be landed. These latter are well sup
plied with provisions and everything
necessary for a long stay in the Arctic, but
if they do not strike pay gold inside of a
THE RAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. APRIL 7, 1896.
few months they will have to get back
home the best way possible.
After landing tbe gold miners the Theo
bald will return to Uoal Bay ana load lor
San Francisco. About twenty-eight men

INVESTIGATING MISS SOULE.
The Board of Education Hearing Charges
of Unnecessary Punishment.
The investigation of the charges against
Miss F. A. Soule, a teacher in the public
schools, against whom a complaint was
recently lodged by the parents of a child
in her class, was beeun last evening before
the Classilication Committee of the Board
of Education; Attorney Highton appearing
for Miss Soule.
The charge was that Miss Soule had
whipped a child with more than necessary
severity. Attorney Highton objected to
the jurisdiction of the committee, on the
ground that the rules of the board re
quired that the matter should be heard by
the full board.
This rule was shown to have been
changed and Mr. Highton's objection was
overruled. The matter went over nniil
next Wednesday, when it is expected that
the taking of testimony will begin.

AN ODD RUNAWAY COUPLE
One an Opium Fiend, the Other
an Innocent Country
Girl.
WERE CAUGHT AT THE FERRIES
They Had Made Preparations to Leave
for Stockton on the Steamer
J. D. Peters.
There was quite a little scene on the
water front yesterday, in which a sergeant
of police, an opium liend and a handsome
girl, apparently not more than 15 years of
age, played.the principal parts. The "fiend"
had run away with the girl and was trying
to get to Stockton, where he is said to
have well-to-do relatives, and to all ap
pearances the child was only too willing to
go with him. They wore waiting for the
steamer to sail when the police officer be
came suspicious and stopped the flight.
W. Zignego is about 27 years old and his
relatives are said to be well-to-do Stockton
people, while his brother is well known in
this City. Some time ago he took the
Kecly cure and Jatterly he came back to
San Francisco "clothed and in his right
mind." At least that is what hig relatives
gave out. Ho only gave up one vice to
begin practicing another, however, and the
last state of the man was worse than the
first. He took to the use of opium.
A few weeks a' o he made the acquaint
ance of Emma Phillips, whose home is in
Fruito, Glenn County. For some time
past she has been helping in the household
of Officer John Mullen, at Redwood court,
off Howard street, near Sixteenth. How
the two came to know each other nobody
seems to know, but last week Emma asKeil
and received $7 and permission to visii her
friends in the country. Instead, she went
to Oakland on Friday night with Zignego,
and finally showed up at the Stockton
steamer yesterday afternoon.
The couple was pacing up and down the
bulkhead between Clay ana Washington
street wharves when Sergeant Mahoney
first noticed them. He div not like the
look of the man and proceeded to accost
him.
Zignego told one story and Miss Phillips
told another, so "the sergeant took them to
the Harbor Police Station. While Miss
â o told one story and Miss Phillips
her, so the sergeant took them to
aor Police Station. While Miss
Phillips does not look to be more than 15
she s.wore to Captain â  Dunleavy ; that she
was 19. The latter did not believe, her,
however, and sent a messenger, out to see
Officer I>iul!en. During the absence of the
messenger the girl said :' that she- and
Zignego were to have >, been Â« married in
Oakland on. Friday, but that they could
not set a license. She paid $2 for a room
yesterday morning. "; They started ; for
Stockton, where Zigneco said they would
have no difficulty in getting married.
About this time the officer leturned
from seeing Officer Mullen and reported
that Zignego was no good and that his in
tention whs to put the girl in a house of
ill-lame. He asked that she be sent back
to his horns and Officer Mackey was de
tailed to escort , her Â't here.;.' Zignego I was
held, pending" a further investigation.
Had it not been for the foresight of Ser
geant Mahoney the chances are that the
couple would now ;be on their way to
Stockton and the* .girl's ruin -would have
been completed: â¢-â  â â¢â â >. â¢â  â  â  .; .- â

Wells, Fargo 4; Co. Must 'Now Pay Rent for
. Their Ferry Offices. '>;
The Harbor Commissioners held a short
session yesterday. They leave for Niles
this morning to examine the quarry, and
simply met to pass the j bills. I Commis
sioner Cole expressed himself ,in favor of
the Colusa stone, but the other members
of the board thought '. it better to visit
NileÃ before arriving at a decision. 1- The
stone for ; the ' ferry depot - will not *be
required for some time, and as the â  Stone
cutters' Union has written the board
stating ' its members would handle any
stone selected by the board there is ;no
need for haste.;. .]'â '..
The engines of the tug Governor Irwin
are to be changed ;â  from \ simple to Â£ com

President Colnon introducad a resolu
tion to the effect that Wells; Fargo & Co
be charged. s7s; a month for the apace it
occupies, commencing with May 1. In
support of the motion he pointed out that
every ' transportation . company .' on the
front was ; paying ; rent except the one in
question. â¢ . Commissioner ; Cole .?'* was op
posed to the motion and demanded a roll
call. Colnon and â / Chadbourne l voted aye
and Cole did not vote at all, so the motion
was carried and Wells; Fargo & Co. will in
future have to pay $75 a month rental. â â '<â '

The steamer Kahului sailed for the Ha
waiian Islands z. yesterday with ; over 1000
tons of general merchandise aboard and
500 tons of coal in her bunkers. She -".was
deep in i the water, ? but 'as i buoyant as | a
cork. When } she i listed ft a few days > ago
there was no coal in her bunkers and no
water in her tanks. She is a narrow ship,
and when the coal was shot; into her she
heeled over. Her owners have perfect
confidence in the steimer and say they
would not be likely to put 1000 tons of
cargo in a crank ship.
Governor riudd came down from Sacra
mento yesterday and went for a sail on
the bay with George A. Knight on the
Jatter's launch Athlete. They were out
for nearly three hours, and during the
run the Governor visited the Comanche.
STOLE A DIAMOND PIN.
Michael Nolan, Carpenter and Politi
cian, Arrested for Grand Larceny.
Michael Nolan, a carpenter and well
known politician in the Mission, was ar
rested by Detective Harry Reynolds yester
day morning and booked at the City
Prison on the charge of grand larceny.
Early yesterday morning Dr. I. N. Hous
ton went into the saloon, 116 Eddy street,
and ordered a drink. Nolan and some
friends were standing at the bar, and it
is now charged that while Houston was
drinking his cocktail Nolan put his arm
around his neck and abstracted a dia
mond pin, worth $75, from his scarf.
J. M. Evans, the proprietor of the
saloon, took Houston's watch and chain
from him for safe keeping. Houston had
complained about losing his diamond pin,
and Nolan, when he saw Evans taking
Houston's watch and chain, said to Evans,
"Don't do that; they will swear you took
his pin also." Shortly afterward Nolan
and his friends left the saloon.
Evans went to Nolan's room in the
Baltimore House on Bush street and
Granf avenue and asked Nolan for the
diamond pin. Nolan and his friends fell
upon him and nearly Killed him. The
police were then notified and Nolan was
arrested.
ANNUAL ROUND-UP.
The Police Arresting: "Grafters" in the
City Hall Corridors.
The police have decided to make their
annual round-up of "grafters" around the
Police Courts and City Hall corridors.
Yesterday morning Policeman Wagner
arrested J. T. Gallagher, familiarly known
as '"Chippy," and he was booked for vio
lating the ordinance. He was released on
his own recognizance by Judge Campbell.
Some months a^o Gallagher was warned to
keep away from the Larkin-street corridor,
and when Wagner saw him there yester
day morning he promptly arrested him.
Otto Kahn, the waiter, who was arrested
on Saturday by instructions of Judge Con
lan for ""rafting," appeared before the
Judge yesterday morning. He asked for a
change of venue, which was denied. Then
he demanded a jury trial, and the Judge
continued the case till Thursday, to be
tnen fixed for trial. Kahns bonds were
fixed at $1000, which staggered him.
DR. DEPEW AND BOHEMIA
Disappointment Felt at the Ora
tor's Inability to Attend
a Jinks.
Horace G. Platt's Witty Say : ngs at
the Union League Banquet Won
the New Yorker.
Chauncey M. Depew says he has been
: everywhere in California. In Bohemia,
j however, he has never been. It may be a
disappointment to him that he has been
unable to accept the invitation to accom
pany the shining lights of the arts and
crafts, the wits of the clubs and the leaders
of the professionals into that fairyland
where they are wont to recreate them
selves and drive dull care away. Certainly
it is a great disappointment to the club
men.
When it was noised about that the star
I after-dinner talker of the two hemispheres
contemplated a visit to California, and
when the fact became fully established
that "Our Chnuncey," aa he is affection
ately called by New Yorkers, would tarry
i a few days in the metropolis of the coast,
Bohemia besought him to come and make
merry at a jinks.
Mr. Depew came, he saw, was conquered
by our splendor and our greatness and
now "ho has went" and Bohemia know
him not. That is the reason why Bo
hemia is sad. Depew is regarded as the
most distinguished private citizen and
clubman in America. Therefore Bohemia,
having entertained ali the heads of the
different schools of talent, wanted this
artist of the rostrum to leave his auto
graph in the big book and select a niche
among the immortals for his picture on
the wall. But the Union League sounded
the first call for dinner in the banquet
hall and the orator responded.
At the banquet at the Palace on Satur
day evening Mr. Depew rÂ«ceived a taste of
what he might have had in large doses
had he gone to Bohemia. Horace G.
Platt bombarded the distinguished visitor
with Bohemian wit. He told funny stor
ies, cracked jokes, sometimes at Chaun
cey's expense and sometimes at his own,
and kept his hearers in roars of laughter.
"If Mr. Depew has his cathode ray with
him," he began, "he can trim it on me
and he will hnd that I have read all his
speeches."
Depewf in a low toneâ Great Scott!
Alter the laughter had died away Mr.
| Platt renewed his claim of having* swal
lowed the Depew encyclopedia and closed
j the sally by advising Chauncey to go home
: and cut down his chestnut tree.
"Why is Chauncey liice a New York or
j Chicago sky-scraper?" he observed, and
i then answered the question by saying he
', was built one story at a time. Platt hav
j ing scored one on Depew there was great
laughter.
The King of Bohemia said that as he was
the only Democrat at the gathering he
was sorry to see differences cropping up
among Republicans as to who would be
the next victim of Democratic invinci
bility.
"We don't care whom you nominate," he
said, "whether it is IS T ew York's son,
Maine's son, Ohio's son, or AJ-li-son" â
[laughter and applause]â "we will give him
a pood funeral. [Renewed laughter.]
In a more serious vein the Bohemian
orator said:
"Mr. Depew has spoken of what a person
I could buy in Californiaâ big trees, big
| men, big oranges and big beets, but there
i is one thine that no one can buy â a Cali
j fornia welcome to the stranger within :ier
j gate, and that welcome California gives to
that prince of good fellows, that distin-
I puished private citizen whose name
I Bohemia would have been glad to add to
I its roll of honorâ Chauncey M. Depew."
At the conclusion of the address, which
i was repiete with bright sayings, the prince
j of New York goodfeliowship left his seat
at the banquet-board and went over and
warmly grasped the extended hand of the
> prince of San Fiancisco goodfellow.ship.
! Then all the guests made astronomical
observations through the bottoms of ttieir
wine glasses and the band played oil.
Free Floral Kxbibitlon.
A fine exhibit of wildflowerg will be given at
the next meeting of the California State Floral
Society, which will be held in the Marble room
of the Valace Hotel April 10, at 2 p. m. All
flower-lovers are invited to attend. Three
prizes are to be competed for. The society
will give one for the best collection of twenty

artistic bouquet, while Mrs. Stringer wishes
her premium to be given to the dainties bou
quet. The display of the collection of native
bulbs will be continued.
A Point in Masonry.
Powell S. Law son has petitioned the Su
preme Court for a writ compelling the Masonic
body to which he belongs to try him lor his
offenses before his own chapter. He is a Royal
Arch Mason, and he is being tried for asking a
mini to join the Scottish Rite. This was held
to be un-Masonic conduct, and he was assigned
to trial before Chnpter 28 of Stockton. He be
longs to Chapter 3 of Sacramento, a::d ii he is

WILL SUE FOR THE STOCK
Trust Company Takes Up the j
Fight for People's Bank
Depositors.
WHY FLOURNOY WAS DEPOSED
President Stone Is a Stockholder and
Does Not Like to Be
Su;d.
Gunnison, Booth <fe Bartnett, attorneys
for the California Bafe Deposit and Trust
Company, which represents the majority
of the unfortunate People's Home Bank
depositors, are preparing briefs for a suit
against the bank's directors and expect to
file the papers this week. It is under
stood that this suit will be one of the most
interesting and sensational of the many
legal conliict3 over the settlement of the
bank's affairs.
Mr. Bartnett, who has charge of the
case, stated yesterday that the real issue
was whether the unpaid capital stock of
the defunct savings institution would have
to be paid.
"We are taking prompt measures," he
said, "to protect the depositors and they
may rest assured we are not neglecting
their interests; but there is so much
crookedness in the workings of the bank
it is almost impossible to find out what
has been done.
''The matter that is of most importance
at present is the payment of two-thirds of
the capital stockâ that is, two-thirds of a
million dollars. Of course there is much
of that amount that cannot be collected,
as the stock is held by irresponsible par
ties, but quite a large share of the stock is
held by wealthy men. They should be
made to pay the balance of their stock,
and they are legally responsible. They
assumed the responsibilities of stockhold
ers, and now are evading payment of their
share.
"This question is of far more importance
than the Sherman matter. The directors
of the bank don't want to collect the bal
ance of the stock. John Flournoy, as an
attorney of the bank, endeavored to col
lect it by legal process, and he was dis
missed.
''Colonel Stone, president of the board of
directors, is a stockholder, so you can see
why the board did not wish to collect the
stock. He owns something like 100 shares,
so his portion would be considerable.
"Then there are men on the board who
never had a? 1 interest in the bank. S. K.
Thornton, for instance. What business
has he on that board? He does not own a
dollar's worth of stock and has no interest
anywhere in the People's Home Bank.
And there is Taylor, a membei of the pa
per firm. "Why should he be a director?
He does not own any stock, nor has he
any interest in the bank. If matters were
allowed to go on as they have been going
in the management of the bank the de
positors would get nothing."
SHOT A BLOOMER GIRL.
Martha Smith Injured by the Explosion
of a Pistol.
Lucius Pease, who is connected with the
Portland Oregonian newspaper, went to a
shooting-gallery on Post street and Grant
avenue last nicsht to try his skill with a
pistol.
Martha Smith, a girl in bloomers, was in
charge of the gallery and she banded him
a pistol. While Pease was examining it
to see that it was all right it accidentally
exploded. The girl fell fhrieking to the
floor, and to Pease's dismay he found the
bullet had entered her left groin.
Pease called a hack and had the wounded
girl driven to her home on Stevenson
street. He accompanied her and procured
a physician, agreeing to bear all expenses
for the treatment of the patient.

AT THE CITY PLAYHOUSES.
Frank Mayo Makes a Successful
Hit in "Pudd'nhead
Wilson."
DAILfcY IN A NEW PLAY.
Miss Lisle Leigh Creates a Favorable
Impression in "Doris" at
the Grand.
"The Night Clerk'" which was produced
Â»t the California Tueater last night, is in
the usual vein of John J. McXaily's farce
comedies. Plot there is absolutely none,
and the situations are never particularly
humorous, but such as they are they serve
a? peps on which to hang a number of
specialties, and tne dialogue bristles with
with a certain sort of brisk repartee which
keeps the audience in a mild ripple of
laughter all through the performance.
This is the stylo of dialogue:
"That man in Â»>4 is lying down, and he
cays the roof is leaking."
"All right. Charge him a bath."
'The Night Clerk" was evidently writ
ten as a vehicle for Peter F. Dailey to dis
play those humorous characteristics which
have endeared him to the farce-comedy
loving public. As Owen More he has a
chance to sing, dance and wring the reluc
tant greenback from most of the people
with whom he is brought into contact with
a guileless graoe and lack of conscience
which are peculiarly I 'alley's own. He
rattled off his repartees in the old dashingr
style, though they are not quite as good
as" those in "A Country Sport," and he
was recalled aeain and again after his vocal
medley.
A eood deal of fan in the piece was due
to John G. Sparks as Barney Brogan, a
wealthy an eccentric Hibernian gentleman
who parted with his greenbacks lavishly
on the smallest provocation, and who sus
tained the burden of the dialogue in
most of the scenes. Barney Brogan was
well played by John G. Sparks.
Miss Jennifc Yeamans does not com
lletely till the aching void in the Dailey
cast left by May Irwin. She played her
role ot Adelaide Starr, an actress with a
certain amount of chic and dash
that savored more of vaudeville
than the comedy stage, and she man
aged to sing without a voice,
which is a very clever feat. In her first
sone, "The Debutante,"' she won warm
applause by entering into a dialogue with
the conductor and giving the impression
that she was continually going to burst
into vocal fireworks, though she did not
uo so.
The rest of the cast scarcely calls for
any special mention. Hugh Mack gave a
fairly humorous take-off of a '"foreign'
theatrical manager and Raymond Hitch
Â« pek was becomingly rapid as Lord Willie
Wilt * '
At the Columbia.
Frank Mayo has found his role and "Pudd'n
head Wilson" is its name. It hardly sounds
romantic, but it is a part which calls for cer-
Frank .Mayo.
tain lights and shades of expression and in
tonation which constitute the very refinement
r>f the phrasing of acting. These touches of
liigh art Mr. Mayo manages to em
-I'luy with ki masterly an ability as to
render fascinating and absorbing * a role
â¢which in other hands would be lanital or tire
some. His droll remarks, couched in classic
brirristerlal phrase, and his hOroic patience
â¢luring the quarter of a century which he
cpends waiting for his first client, are only
equated by the eloquence and regal manli
ness which I'ndd'iihead develops when the
long-awaited client comes, and with him the
tliHnee of the hero's lifetime.
The play deals, as those know who have read
>fark Twain's delightful book, with Southern
life in ante-bellum days, and nothing could
be more artistic than the costumes worn
by the members of the cast. Dowdy and
i mtnÃtic enough they seem, but they are
liii-u-rieally correct. The bristling shirt-frill,
lhe antiquated stock, the broad, sweeping
train and the cumbrous crinoline lit in charm
ingly with the broad dialect yet heard in
6onie out-of-the-way places "down South,"
rendering t h e- play a peculiarly interesting
omi satisfying study in American history.
Emmet C. King, as Howard Pembroke, a
bachelor lawyer, was very cordially received
by last night's audience. His methods are
B'.neularly natural, while his voice, though soft
ana well modulated, has a ringing, carrying
quality rarely met save in those strident, sibil
lant tones which render the work of many
otherwise excellent actors so very tiresome.
Miss Eleanor Moretti, who was so successful
bs toe queen in "Ruy Bias" not long ago,
hhines with perhaps even greater luster as
Koxy. while her son Chambers, represented by
.Arnold Daly, is so much at home in his exaet
irg part that he seems not to be acting at all.
Miss Lucille Luverne is exceedingly good as
â \Vilsnn's sister, her quaint, old-fashioned ways
Biid kindly arts and graces winning many'a
round of applause. The other characters are
â well sustained.
The scenery is particularly deserving of men
tion, the arrangement of "Driscoll's yard" In
the prologue and first act and of 'Wilson's
ruined taill in the second being specially
artistic. The house was crowded last night
and every indication points to a most success
ful run.
At the Tivoli.
Bluebeard, the sanguinary despot and terror
of the nursery, reigns at the Tivoli amid a host
of warriors and pint-limbed houris. Raftael,
however, is too gentle and graceful for the
bloody part. To bo sure his voice soars above
chorus and orchestra with a ringing, silvery
jower peculiarly his own, but he should be
just a little moie brutal and villainous.
Funny Ferris. Hartmann makes a success as
Ibsahim. an>l indeed everybody would be sur
prised it he made a failure. Fatima, his daugh
ter, the wife of Bluebeard, finds an able ex
ponent In Gertrude Aylward.and the other
parts show careful drilling and intelligent
study. The ballets are a feature of the perform
ance. To be sure, most of the dancers
geeru never to have heard of dancing on
the toes, and one or two of them light on
their 6oles with a dull thud; but their time
Is perfect and their costumes beautiful. The
"ballet of roses" in particular reflects much
credit upon Miss Cook's able direction.
The piece will run during the present week,
Â»na perhaps longer if its present popularity be
an indication of its coming success.
At the Alcatar.
At length the variety show at the Alcnznr
has ceased from troubling. The drama now
nolds the fort, or the stage, nnd audiences are
oecoraing something like what they were be
fore the inauguration of the disastrous "con
tinuous show."
in "Kanch 10" the able stock company
ihines to great advantage. Though the popu
lar American melodrama is far from new, it is
ilways interesting on account of the wide
icope which it gives for fine acting and origi
nal methods. Leonard Grover, as l'eter Par-'
.icular Prose, and Gordon Foster, as Barney
Holt, are, perhaps, the best male mem
3ers of the cast, while May Noble, as
*nnie Smalley and Josephine Gassinaun us
Keely Barrett are particularly deserving of
praise, Miss Gassmann's impersonation being
very artistic. The tableaux are most effective,
the stage mechanism evidently having under
gone a thorough everhauling. Between the
acts Miss Victoria Black sings' some good songs
and the "Electros," Armand and Carmen, in
troduce some of their duets, dances and
startling transformations. The piece is booked
for the remainder of the week.
At tho Baldwin.
Jamei O'Neill's "Virginius" has become
classical. In last night's presentation at the
Baldwin the great actor gained new laurels,
the audience at times manifesting great enthu
siasm. To-night he gives "The Courier of
Lyons."
The Grand Opera-Honse.
Miss Lisle Leigh, the new leading lftdy at
the Grand, made her debut last night in
"Doris" and created a very favorable impres
sion. Phe is graceful, natural, and takes care
to avoid the melodramatic sins of ranting and
tearing a passion to tatters. Some of
the scenes in "Doris" were perhaps
a little heavy and exacting for Miss
Leigh's caliber, but even in these she kept per
fect control over herself and remained simple
and natural.
Mi.Â«s Leigh's best scene perhaps was the one
in which her villainous husband, supposed to
be dead, comes back and rinds her the happy
wife of another man. The situation was a
strong one and the actress rose well to the oc- I
casiou. In person Miss Lisle Leigh is tall and
slight, with a good stage presence, and she has
a pleasant, well-modulated voice.
Both Darrell Vinton and Fred Butler might
with advantage have been on better speaking
terms with their lines, otherwise they played
the part of the hero and the villain respect
ively well. Mr. Swain was effective as the
meddling school director, and Frank Hatch
made a good secondary villain of the smooth,
oily type.
Benrimo gave an effective picture of an old
rector, and the ret of the cast was good.
"Doris" is exceptionally well staged.
At the Orphenm.
Elena Lelia, the singing doll, made a suc
cessful debut at the Orpheum last night. She
is a young lady who makes tip to resemble a
mechanical toy, and as she has a remarkably
high, liirht voice, she is able to carry out the
illusion excellently. Klc-ua Lelia is an inter
esting and artistic- novelty.
The Marvelics, who might be called the
three boneless brotners, gave a very clever
harlequinade. La Belle Carmen, a lady who
dresbed in crimson silk and diamonds, gave a
very graceful performance on the tight rope.
The Hauns are clever, but they might with
advantage tone down their performance some
what, hegommer, the ventriloquist, is as pop
ular as ever and the rest of last week's hold
over periormers are earning the usual amount
of applause.
HUMMING HEADQUARTERS
Republican Bustle Increases as
the Time for the Primary
Nears.
Polling-Places and Election Officers
Will Be Named en Thursday
Evening Nex'.
The members of the Republican County
Committee representing the Fourth
District decided to postpoue their
adjourned meeting, which was set
for last evening, and to meet for the selec
tion of polling places and the appoint
ment of election olb'cers on next Thursday
evening after the adjournment of the regu
lar meeting of the County Committee.
The County Committeemen from the Fifth
District will meet at the same time for the
same purpose.
Republican headquarters at 850 Market
street were crowded until a late hour last
evening with prominent party workers,
leaders of district organizations and
others. A number of the members of the
County Committee and of the Congres
sional district committees dropped in to
meet each other and their friends, ana
John D. Spreckels received a stream of
callers throughout the evening.
An interview with P. E. McCarthy gave
a typical expression of the opinions and
sentiments that come to headquarters
from every corner of the City. Mr. Mc-
Carthy is one of the best known and most
influential Republicans of the Thirty
seventh District, and for twenty years has
been an active Republican without being
a spoils politician.
"The Thirty-seventh District," he said,
"was never in better condition as far as
the interests of the party are concerned.
Everybody is pleased with the stand for
clean ana fair politics taken by John I).
Spreckele, and they will unitedly support
the regular party organization and the
ticket. We know that this year
we are going to have decency,
honesty and a fair show to everybody at
the primary. That is what nearly every
body in our district demands. The prim
ary two years ago. under the Burns-Kelly-
Mahoney management, was a disgrace.
We opposed them then and they brought
rock-rollers and toughs from all over
the City in wagon-loads to win
out. We know that we are not go
lag to have any of that this year.
There are a very few dissatisfied politi
cians in the district just now, but they
know they can gain nothing by standing
with Kelly and Mahoney and they w ill get
into line with the rest of the party. As soon
as the time is ripe for active campaign
work we will get in with club organiza
tions and hard work and pull for the Re
publican party."
"All I can say is that everything is
lovely, and we will go right ahead with
one of the biggest, fairest and cleanest
primaries the party has seen in this City,"
suid Charles \V. M&nwaring, chairman of
the County Committee. "I can t see how
the opposition that Kelly and Mahony are
trying to tick up for "their own ends is
is going to amount to anything. Ail the
Republicans that I meet everywhere over
the City recognize the primary to be held
by the County Committee as the
one representing the legality, regularity
and decency of the party. It is a fact that
any one can discover by a little inquiry
that the mass of the Republican voters
will recognize and support the regular
primary. Kelly and Mahoney's friends
are steadily faliing away from them and
the few that remain with them are misled
by thinking that Dan Burns is coming
back to take a hand, which he is not. If
Kelly and Mahoney elect a delegation to
Sacramento at their rump primary there
is no chance of their seating them. The
people from the interior are not going to
take a hand in any wrangle that Martin
Kelly and Jerry Mahoney may get
up, and they will recognize the
delegation sent by the regular party
organization here and by the great mass
of the Republican voters. Kelly and Ma
honey perhaps think that they can set a
little something for themselves'by kicking
long enough, but we are paying no atten
tion to them and fearing nothing from
them. The party is overwhelmingly
against them and we will go right along
with our primary as though they did not
exist."
The notorious Jack Hoey of Brannan
street called at the Registrar's office yes
terday for the ballot-boxes, which Kelly
and Mahoney propose to use at their pri
vate primary, for which they have not yet
fixed a date.
SUTRO'S NEW OFFICE .
The Finest Apartment in the New Hall
Is Now Occupied.
Mayor Sutro took possession of the mag
nificent new office provided for him by the
City Hall Commission yesterday, and in
future will receive visitors in the new
apartment, which, in location and ap
pointments, is probably the finest office in
the City Hall. The room is directly east
of the Mayor's old private sanctum and
has windows on three sides, looking into
the rotunda of the tower, toward Market
street, ana down City Hall avenue to Mc-
Allister street. The furniture is of pol
ished mahogany, a handsome desk and
bookcase being among the pieces. One of
the most unique ornaments of the room is
a beautiful mantel of California marble.
The velvet carpet and curtains are in
perfect keeping with the other appoint
ments.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 1896.
SUPERVISORS IN SESSION
Ex-Clerk Sullivan Is Given an
Assistant Secretary
ship.
WILL VISIT CASTRO LAKES.
The Supervisors Declare Baker Street
From Golden Gate to Oak
a Boulevard.
The courts having decided that the
Board of Supervisors exceeded its au
thority in creating the salaried office of
bond clerk, the resignation of John J.
Sullivan, who was appointed to the place,
was accepted by the board yesterday.
Sullivan was provided for, however, by
appointing him assistant secretary of the
Finance Committee at the same salary he
was to receive as bond clerk, his pay to
begin from August 5, 1895, the date when
he was first appointed.
The Committee on Water Supply made
a recommendation that was accepted by
the boardâ that a visit be made to the
Castro lakes, near Castroville, Monterey
County, to ascertain whether a suitable
water supply from that point could be
procured for San Francisco.J
Baker street, from Golden Gate avenue
to Oak street, was, by a resolution finally
passed, declared to be a public boulevard
on which no heavy traffic will be allowed,
and along which no railroad franchise
shall ever be granted.
The ordinance declaring the Almshouse
Tract to be the future location of the City
and County Hospital, and also for the hos
pital for contagious diseases, was brought
up for passage to print, but a motion to
lay over for two weeks was carried unani
mously.
The proposition to condemn Branch Jail
3, on account of its bad sanitary condition,
was laid over for sixty days, on motion of
Supervisor Hughes.

Jubilee Held Over the Completion of
Charles and French Streets
Bridge.
The Holly Park Improvement Club is
jnbilant. The various members say that
at last there is good foundation to believe
that College Hill will be transformed into
a spot where wearied workers of all kinds
can come and spend a delightful holiday.
Said Treasurer Martin Bahrt: "The ex
cuse given us by the Board of Supervisors
for taking no action so far, that the hill
lacks a water supply, has been eliminated
from the question. Chief Engineer Her
mann Schussler has let it be understood
that by the middle of May the improve
ments in the adjacent reservoir will be
completed and that water can be had in
plenty."
Besides the new bridge at the intersec
tion of French and Charles streets has
been finished, and Saturday evening a
general jubilee was held on the bridge. A
iree lunch was given, there was a torch
light procession and many enthusiastic
speeches were made Not even the rain,
which descended in plenty toward the
close of the exercises, tended to dampen
the ardor of the participants.

THEY WANT MORE POLICE
The Fairmount District Overrun

Idlers.
Beer-Drinking, Card-Playing and Firing
Vacant Houses Their
Pastime.
The residents of the Fairmount district,
together with tre Mission road section
from Twenty-ninth street out toward the
Ingleside track, are of the opinion that the
Supervisors should provide a police sta
tion for that locality. Since the advent of
the racetrack and the other improvements
in that neighborhood an increase in the
floating population ha 9 been noticeable.
In proof of this it is pointed out that at
tempts have been made to set on fire a few
of the vacant houses on the outskirts of
the Fairmount district.
A few weeks ago a vacant house on
Ciienerv ana Randall streets was set on
fire and destroyed by what the neighbors
think the wanton acts of a band of idle
hoodlums, who spend their leisure hour.'
in bter-drinkintr, playing cards and carous
ing in the vacant houses or empty lots.
Another case of attempting to burn a
cottage on Lindsay street, the property of
ijrs. Poole, was reported to the police "last
week. Mrs. Poole'a gardener discovered
that some person or persons had broken
into the basement of the cottage and gath
ered some shavings left there by a carpen
ter, who had been making some" repairs on
the premises. The shavings had been
piled up against the wall and set on fire,
as the burnt paDer on the wall indicated,
but fortunately the intention of the evil
doer miscarried and no great damage was
done.
The house destroyed on California ave
nue, iv the rear of the Mission carhouse,
cannot be charged to an incendiary, a3
that hre originated, ft is supposed, from a
coal-oil lamp which was left burning by a
careless roomer.

0, D. Faulkner, 2731 Hyde street, was taken
to the Receiving Hospital last evening to have
two knife wounds in his left arm dressed, and
A. W. Nicholson was booked at the City l'rison
on the charge of assault to mimlt-r. Faulkner's
wife was standing at the corner of Hyde and
Union streets when Nicholson stepped up to
her and used an insulting expression. Faulk
ner, who was close by, overheard him and
knocked him down. Nichol-on jumped to his
feet, pulled out a knife and slashed Faulkner
in tht: arm. He then chased .Mrs. Faulkner,
but she escaped from him.

I
SUICIDE THEORY FAILS.
â 
Mrs. MeWhirter Will Receive
Over Sixteen Thousand
Dollars.
SENSATIONAL CASE REVIEWED.
The United States Court of Appeals
Affirms the Decision of the
Lower Court.
The United States Court of Appeals has
decided that the Connecticut Mutual Life
Insurance Company must pay the wife of
Louis B. MeWhirter, who was shot and
killed at Fresno, the sum of $16,137 50 and
costs.
This decision is the outcome of one of
the most sensational murders, and prob
ably the most sensational suit against an
insurance company, recorded within the
history of California jurisprudence. For
nearly four years this suit has been hang
ing fire before the courts. Essayists have
written and lawyers have proclaimed that
McWhirter, who was a foremost lawyer
and politician of Fresno, committed sui
cide, that his wife might acquire the emol
uments of his several insurance policies.
These theories were at once dissipated by
the volume of evidence which the com
plainants in the suit against the insurance
company in question readily presented.
Judge Knowles handed down the
opinion yesterday, aflirming the judgment
of the lower court. It awards Nannie S.
Me -Whirter, widow of the murdered lawyer,
$16,W7 5O from the Connecticut Mutual
Life Insurance Company.
The action was based upon two life in
surance policies issued to the late Louis
B. McWhirter. One was for ?,~>ooo and was
dated December 18, 1891, and the other
was for $10,000 and dated March 15, ISO 2.
On August 29, 1802. McWhirter was shot
and killed in his back yard at Fresno.
The complainant claimed that he was
murdered, but the insurance company set
forth that it was a case of suicide. It will
be recalled that the case was vigorously
contested by both sides at the time and
resulted in a judgment for Mrs. Mc-
Whirter for the full amount and costs.
The appeal was based on the grounds
that McWhirter concealed from the insur
ance company the fact that he had ene
mies who threatened his life; that the
court erred in charging the jury to the ef
fect that the presumption was that Mo
Winner did not kill himself and for not
giving certain instructions requested by
the defendant; also that the demurrer to
'he complaint interposed by the plaintiff
in error should have been sustained.
"The cause of action," says Judge
Knowles, "accrued before the filing of
the complaint. Hence the demurrer was
not well taken upon this point. It should
also be noted that after the demurrer was
overruled the insurance company filed its
answer, in which there is no pretense that
the cause of action had not accrued and
went to trial upon the merits of the case.
Unless the complaint clearly failed to
ptate a cause of action such action waived
the demurrer.
"I can see no error in rejecting the evi
dence of Bernhard. It was sought to show
that McWhirter about four years before
his death said to Bernhard that if he ever
did anything which would bring disgrace
uron himself or his family he would kill
himself. There was no attempt to show
that McWhirter had, as a matter of fact,
done anything that had brought disgrace
upon himself or his family. It is true he
had been arrested upon a charge which he
declared was without foundation. This
does not show that he had done the act
which would induce his suicide according
to his own declaration. That he had ever
upon any conditions thought of commit
ting suicide seems to have been regarded
as pertinent in the case. Ido not conceive
this to be correct.
'Many a man has talked of suicide in the
way McWhirter did, and upon the occa
sion without any intention of committing
the deed. Then the purpose expressed
was so conditioned and so remote that I
cannot conceive that any presumptions
were raised upon the point at issue. If
there were any presumptions to be raised
by such a declaration, I would say tbat it
would be that McWhirter was a man so
sensitive as to his honor that he would not
contemplate the committing of suicide
with the view of defrauding a life insur
ance company.
"The alleged error as to the charge of
the court to the jury that the presumption
was that McWhirter did not kill himself
has already been sustained by the Supreme
Court. In this case the plaintiff in error
in the court below assumed the burden of
proof and undertook to show that Mc-
Whirter did kill himself. Tin's was upon
the theory that the presumption was that
McWhirter did not commit suicide. The
contention of the plaintiff in error cannot
be maintained upon this assignment."
The court held that there were no speci
iied threats against the life of the accused
and concealed by him from the insurance
company shown in the evidence, but there
was evidence of statements of political
enemies, of apprehension of bodily injury.
But there was no fear of death from them.
PROF. STILLMAN'S LECTURE.
He and MUt Anthony Entertain the
Clianning Auxiliary.
Professor J. M. Stillman of Stanford !
University addressed the Charming Auxil- I
iary at its regular monthly meeting at the
Firs! Unitarian Church yesterday after
noon. The life and works of Mme. Sonya
Kovenski, the Russian mathematician, i
furnished him the theme for an eloquent â¢
and entertaining lecture. The lady's ge- i
nius was of the highest order. Hhs won '
f.rst honors from the French Academy of j
Sciences, thÂ«r award betas made when the j
Jearned judges were ignorant of the fact ;
that the competitor was a woman. $he
died in 1890, shortly after she was appointed
to the profossorship of mathematics in the
I'niyersity of Stockholm.
Miss Susan B. Anthony followed with
an address, in which *he referred to Mme.
Koveijski'a struggle with the prejudices
of her parents against her studies, and said
F'H-h conditions were responsible for the
dwariing of much budding genius. She
claimed that suffrage for women would do
away with the last vestiges of such preju
dice.
ASSAULT TO MURDER.
Charles Kwing, Alias " Frenchy," Is
Charged "With Xearly Killing
'.'Paddy" Clarke.
Charles Ewing, alias "Frenchy," alias
"Pistol Chancy," a sailor, was booked at
the City Prison yesterday by Policemen T.
Dillon and C. Callahan on the charge of
assault to murder.
The police believe that Ewing was one
of the two men who slashed "Paddy"
Clarke, the longshoreman, so fearfully on
the night of Saturday, March 28. Clarke's
right hand and waist were so badly cut
that his arm had to be amputated above
the wrist, and a few days ago it was found
necessary to amputate it above the elbow.
The police have been unable to find
Swing's companion, but they say they
know him, and as soon a3 he appears on
the water front he will be arrested.
Eyring ha? been in several scrapes before,
but he has always managed to get out of
them. Two years ago last Christmas Emil
Klaus, who* lived on Beale place, was
struck on the head with a hatchet near
his mother's house and died in a few days.
Ewing was arrested on suspicion of being
the murderer, but as there were no eye
witnesses to the deed he was released
from custody. About a year ago he was
arrested for cutting the watchman on
Beale-street wharf with a knife, but his
luck was with him again and he escaped
punishment as there was no one to corrob
orate the watchman. The watchman's

WAS PUT OFF THE TRAIN
George Martin's Suit Against
the Southern Pacific Rail
road.
Testimony Taken Eefore Judge Dain
gerfield Yesterday Morn
ing.
The case of George N. Martin, who was
put off a train at Towles because the con
ductor thought be had a scalped ticket,
opened before Judge Daingertield yester
day.
Martin was the only witness of the day,
and his cross-examination was not finished
when court adjourned in the evening.
Martin is a resident of Sioux City, lowa.
He came to this State in 1894, bound for
San Diego. He traveled on a ''return"
ticket from Sioux City to San Diego and
back. He arrived in San Diego without
encountering any and having
transacted his business there came to this
City. After remaining here a few days he
started East for his home.
When a little way from Oakland the con
: ductor called for his ticket, and when it
I was presented Martin was told it was a
1 scalped ticket and had to be taken up. He
j protested and showed his match-safe, his
, cane and his ring, and called attention to
! the name on them.it being the same as
that on the ticket. Then he wrote his
1 name, but the conductor said he was dis
guising his handwriting, and so the ticket
! was taken up.
After passing Sacramento another con
! ductor came through the car and demanded
j fares. Martin told him how his ticket had
! been confiscated. The conductor said he
: knew nothing about what any one else
j haJ done. The conductor who had taken
| the train to Sacramento had gone back
i from there, and unless Martin paid his
fare he would have to get off. Martin had
â  not the money and after going as far as
; Towles he was put off. He had asked to be
, put off at some place where there was a
, bank so he couid identify himself and so
| get some money, but the conductor said
; he thought Towles was good enough for
; him.
Martin secured permission to ride back
: to Sacramento on a freight train after pur
-1 chasing a rirst-class ticket, and he went
; into the Sacramento depot to pass the re
i mainder of the nixht. He was ordered out
and at about 4 o'clock in the morning had
to hunt around Sacramento for a hotel.
He was suffering from locomotor ataxia at
the time and he said his trouble was much
jag gravated by his treatment. His cross
â  examination consumed the entire after
: noon and will continue to-day.
WOMEN AS VESTRYMEN
A Question That Is Puzzling
the Episcopal Priest
hood.
of the Fact That
Pertinent in
Annual Pari h Meetings Are
Held To-Day.
Are women communicants eligible to
office of vestryman?
The question has been discussed at in
formal meetings of the rectors of various
City parishes recently, but it was agreed
to disagree, and the decision was left to an
attorney. The ladies have as yet mani
fested no interest in the question, not by
any overt act at least. The question is
pertinent at this time because of the an
nual parish meetings to be held to-day, at
which the election of vestrymen will take
place.
No Episcopal church has a lady on its
vestry, and if by any fortuitous or unfor
tuitous combination of circumstances one
is elected to-day it will be the first instance
of the kind in the history of that church.
The California Diocesan Convention,
held in Los Angeles a year ago, gave to
women communicants the right to vote.
The contingency of their desiring to hold
office was not considered at the time. W hat
tirst opened the vexed question was the
election of Mrs. Octavius .Parker, wife of a
priest at Ventura, as delegate to the prim
ary convention at Los Angeles in Decem
her, which elected Bishop Johnson to his
high office.
"If a woman is eligible to a delegate
hhip &he must also be eligible to the
vestry," is the way that some members of
the priesthood argue, while the others
say, "But all voters art not eligible to all
offices. For instance, thousands of peo
ple vote for President of the United Htates
who are not eligible to that office."
Meanwhile the priests cogitate. It has
come to light that a reader of the Pacific
Churchman, the organ of Episcopalianism
on the coast, addressed a letter to the
erudite editor of that journal asking him
to cut the (iordian knot of ethical diffi
culties. Mr. Chetwood's reply was to ad
vise the anxious %ne to seek a secular at
torney.

of assault with v deadly weapon. â â¢ She said her

VOORSANGER'S REPROOF
Asks Methodists Why They Try
Their Strength Against
Israel.
PASTORS HEAR IN SILENCE.
The Baptists Say Cutting Things About
the Useless Miracles of
Throsophy.
"Do your religions duty as you think
right. Go to the people you think need
converting, but remember that the Jews
hav.e been law-abiding citizens, and why
should you not inquire before measuring
your religions strength against that of
Israel?"
It was to these words and others in the
same strain that the Methodist pastors
listened yesterday morning from the
mouth of Rabbi Voorsanger. The rabbi
was not down on the printed programme
of the day; in fact, his advent was a sur
prise to most of those present, but two
weeks ago a committee of pastora. Dr. W.
R. Goodwin being president, indorsed a
little mission to Christianize Jews, which
has been started at Cambrian Hall on
Mission street. Yesterday Rabbi Voor
sanger went to their meeting to tell the
pastors his mind about that indorsement.
"I understand." began the rabbi, "that
the Methodist ministry has indorsed a so
called Christian-Jewish mission. I have
no wish to interfere with your domestic
policy, but I should be extremely sorry if
that vote had been given under a misap
prehension. It was stated that the
strength of Israel was waning, that Israel
was ripe for the ingathering. That is not
so. Israel was never so strong as it is to
day. I do not speak on any narrow
minded grounds, but 1 do not believe you
would wish to lend yourselves to an un
dertaking under a misapprehension. Israel
is 2,000,000 strong in the United States to
day, and I want to tell you this, that
there is not so much to trouble about in
the spiritual condition of the Jews as there
is in the need to convert trie thousands of
heathen living in the United States. The
Jew is not a heathen ; he is what you
would call a Chngtian in his ethics, though
his philosophy is different."
The rabbi proceeded to give a brief his
tory of Christian Jewish missions, which
he said in London, Belfast and other
towns had been the history of a set of
frauds imposing on good Christian people,
and he hinted, in no veiled terms, that the
same might be said of the Jewish Chris
tian mission in this City.
"If a man cannot stund an inquiry why
should he be patronized? There was an
individual in this City who said he was
descended from David. I tell you that
man lied. I can give you proofs, in black
and white, that every Jew converted has
been converted at the cost of $30,000.
When I know mat a man has lost his
character among his own people, when he
poses to you as a great high priest, it is
time to denounce him."
The rabbi, as he descended from the
platform, hurled this Parthian shot at the
assembled pastors: "There are 300,000
Protestants in this City, and only 10,000
are communicants. I am ready "to help
you to gather in the rest, but leave us
alone."
The Methodist pastors had listened in
silence to the whole address. At its con
clusion the silence remained unbrofcen.
H. Chester apd Charles Katze had been
the two gentlemen from the Jewish-
Christian mission who had nought tiaeir
co-operation, but no one asked whether
either or both of these missionaries was
the subject of Rabbi Voorsanger's denun
ciations. When questioned on the subject
of this silence afterward a prominent
Methodist divine said: "The fact is that
we none of us knew how to act. Rabbi
Voorsanger had the floor and was in a
sense our guest; no one liked to get up
and argue, so we just sat there in embar
rassed silence."
Distinguished guests with a few sting
ing words to say seemed to be raining on
the Methodist pastors yesterday. After
the rabbi, in a silence that could be felt,
had taken his seat, Miss Susan B. Anthony
was introduced and proceeded to tell the
pastors why, from a political standpoint,
they had little more power in the com
munity than members of the disenfran
chised sex,
"1 am here," said Miss Anthony, "to
tal,k to you in favor of having the word
'male : struck from your constitution.
What I ask of you is to use your influence
with your party, whichever party it may
be, to have a suffrage planfc put in your
platform. I ask this of you preachers, be
causeâl hate to say itâ but your political
influence is scarcely more than mine, as a
woman ; and why ? Because the majority
of your constituents are women." Miss
Anthony concluded by begging her hear
ers to work for the carrying of the
amendment.
The paper of the day, by Rev. Chandon
Fair, was entitled "What I Know About
Chinatown." The speaker gave an inter
esting account of the Mongolian quarter
and ridiculed some erroneous ideas respect
ing it, as for instance that which asserts
that the chief food of its inhabitants con
sistsof catandriog Mesh. The paper ended
with an eloquent comparison of the effects
of Christianity with those of heathendom.
Baptist Preachers.
Theosophy was the subject discussed at
the Baptist preachers' meeting yesterday.
Rev. C. H. Medhurst, pastor of Santa Clara,
read a paper on the subject, in the course
of which he said : "Theosophy is nothing
but modernized Buddism, though this is a
fact which the theosophists themselves
strongly deny."
In proof of his assertion Mr, Medhurst
compared the beliefs of theosophy and
Buddism to show them to be almost iden
tical. He explained how, according to the
law of Karma, the sufferings and woes
sometimes inflicted in this life, on ap
parently innocent people, were explained
on the assumption that they were the ex
piations of sins committed in a previous
state of existence, and the speaker added:
"Theosophy and Buddism have much food
for the brain, but little for the heart.
"In that respect theosophy has fallen be
low its Buddhistic parent, for we read that
Buddha wrought miracles for the good of
humanity, and by that means converted
many people. The theosophists also work
miracles, but they are always among them
selves, and consist of bells ringing when
there are no bells, roses falling from the
ceiling and other miracles which accom
plish no good to humanity. The people
who do t hfje things should take a lesson
from Christian miracles."
In the discussion some of the pastors
thought it was well to study theosophy, in
ordor to combat intelligently the argu
ments of members of the flock who might
have been ensnared by its allurements;
other pastors thought it wiser to leave the
osophy severely alone, but I. D. Woods
said: "What on earth is the use of drop
ping roses and scratching around on ceil
ings when there ia suffering humanity to
be cared for? Why do not they go to
Armenia and feed the starving people
with their miracles?"
"Perhaps they think the Armenians are
only paying for their sins in a former state
of existence and don't want tv meddle
with Karma," remarked Rev. C. H. Ho
bart. Rev. Mr. Boynton said he believed
theosophy must be studied in order to
combat it, but he did not believe in preach
ing on the subject: "If we acjvertfse this
business from the pulpit some of our
bright young people may be led to study
it and be switched off." Pastor Dietz said :
"These are all speculations. Science can
not leach us anything about the here
after."
Presbyterian Preachersi
On the recommendation of a committee
consisting of Rev. Drs. Farrand and Be
vier the Presbyterian Ministerial Associa
tion yesterday morning indorsed a scheme
for peace among the English-speaking
nations, proposed by a certain Pastor ;
Pirch, who is announced as a Baptist pas- I
tor from New England.
The pastor, who, the Baptist ministers
Of this City stated yesterday, was quite \
unknown to them, has a scheme for bring- ;
ing peace and good will on each by grant- i
ing home rule to Ireland, converting the
Solomon Inlanders and bringing the col
ored and white races of this country into
close relations in church circles.
In his printed communication to the ;
Presbyterian Ministerial Association all
these objects are sot forth at considerable
length, and Rev. Mr. Bevier Btated that
al) the association indorsed was the gen
eral principle of settling disputes by arbi
tration. No indorsement was given to
BOCb tstatements aa 'In the fir6t instance
trood tobacco would be more acceptable to
the Solomon Islanders than gilt-edged
Bibles."
The paper of the day, which was by i
Professor Miller of Stanford, gave an in- !
teresting account of a tramp through the ;
northern part of Greece.
Rev. Mr. Kennedy was elected president
of the club for the ensuing three months, j
Rev. F. T. Acres vice-president and Rev.
Mr. Woodward secretary.
Congregational Club.
An interesting paper on "How to Look
Upon Nature" was read yesterday before
the Congregational Monday Club by Rev.
P. Hatch of Berkeley.
LYNCH ON THE COMSTOCK
Another Conference With the
Miners' Union of Vir
ginia City.
â¦ â 
Tangerman's Fate Will Be Decided
When Jere Lynch Comes
Home.
Jere Lynch, president of the Hale &
Norcross Mining Company, is in Virginia
City. He left here for that place laat Sat
urday, and it was understood by his asso
ciatei that he would have a long confer
ence to-day with representatives of the
Miners' Union.
Mr. Tangerman, the superintendent,
whose departure from the Comstock was
accelerated by a multitude of miners, is
still in San Francisco. It is yet uncertain
whether the management will retain him
as superintendent or send to the mine some
one more acceptable to the Miners' Union.
Tangerman says he is anxious to go back.
"I am not afraid. I do not know what
fear is," he remarked.
When Presideut Lynch was in Virginia
City a few days after Mr. Tangerman was
escorted out of town by the miners, they
assured him that they could get along with
any person other than the evicted superin
tendent. Since then the president of the
company has sounded the county officers
of Storey County and the State authorities
at Carson to ascertain if civil and military
forces could be obtained to protect Mr.
Tangerman in the performance of his
duties as superintendent.
The assurances of protection which the â¢
presiusnt expected were not given. The I
Governor of Nevada was not in Carson
when Mr. Lynch called, and the acting
Governor. declined to consider the sugges
tion of calling out troops until the Sheriff
of Storey County indicated that the civil i
authorities were not able to preserve the \
peace. ' . : . . .. . ;_' â  'â¢:' - . /
. President ' Lynch ,: came hack to San j
Francisco burdened with a full sense of '
the honors which he fought so nobly to
obtain in his campaign against Colonel
Nat Messer for the presidency of the com
pany. On returning to the scenes of his
triumph in the town he preserved discreet j
silence \ concerning his mission to the
Comistpck. He likened himself ;to the
sphinx lof his well-loved Egypt, and
went into raptures over 'his own reticence.
Of his second advent in Virginia City,
which began, r significantly, on Easter
Sunday, 'â â â  no - tidings have 5 been received.
When he comes back to San Francisco j
and makes known the details of his second |
conference to Mr., BaÂ»gett and the mine j
directors a decision will be reached on the
question of retaining or dismissing Mr.
Tangerman.
. Recently the .Nevada papers have > been
publishing articles jto show that Mr. Tan
german was accused of stealing bullion in
Colorado. At the office of the secretary of [
the Hale & Norcross .Company the state- i
ment is given out that Mr. Tungerman's '
Colorado career is straight enough. ; All i
that 19 now brought against , him in V the
Nevada press was brought out in the trial
of the Hale & Norcross suits before Judge j
Hebbard in this City. When Tangerman
was on the witness-stand he was asked by ;
Lawyer Deal if he was ever arrested in Col
orado for stealing bullion. Tangerman
replied "Yes," and Deal asked no other
questions. ; .:.,.. '\. *'\, '.'.'"
When the cross-examination was
reached Tangerman told the whole story.
According to , Tangerman's statement
a conspiracy was formed against him and
men were hired to put stolen amalgam on
the Tangerman premises. The conspiracy
was exposed, Tangerman said, the ring
leader confessed, was . indicted, tried and
sentenced to imprisonment- The sum and
substance of the accusation may be found
in the transcript of the Hale & Norcross
case. ': :., :;â  'â '-, -.'-, 'Â. \ â >.. ... .^^ : ' v .
SELLING POOLS TO BOYS.
Thomas Mullen Arrested Outside the
Ingleslrte Racetrack.
About two months ago a boy waÃ ar
rested for selling pools to newsboys and
messenger boys outside the Injjle9ide race
track. He stood beside a tree close to the
fence, and after making up his book he
climbed up the tre and with a pro
gramme in his hand watched the race, be
ing able to tell the winners by the colors
of the jockeys.
The arrest had the effect of stopping the
pool-selling for a time, but on ' Saturday
Captain Gillen was notified that it had
commenced again. Yesterday he detailed
two officers in citizen's clothes to go to the
racetrack, and, sure enough, there was a
crowd of newsboys and messenger-boys
making pools in the same spot. The of
ficers arrested Thomas Mullen, who was
selling (he pools. He gave his age as 24
and his occupation as a performer. He
was charged \yith violating the pool or
dinance.
JUDGE CAMPBELL'S LOSS.
He Left Yesterday to Attend the
Funeral of His Mother.
Judge Campbell adjourned court for ten
days yesterday. He was handed a dis
patch stating that hia mother had died
yesterday morning at Junction City, Or.
The Judge left last night to attend the
funeral.
Mra. Campbell was born in Washington
County, Pa., seventy- five years ago. She
was a daughter of Matthew McKeever,
who was associated with some of the most
noted Abolitionists of Pennsylvania before
the war, and a niece of Alexander Camp-
bell, the founder of the Campbellite or
Christian church.
Her husband was a schoolteacher until
his death in 1894 at the age of 74. While
her husband taught school she taught
musio up to the time of his death. She
had Jive children. Judge Campbell being
next to the youngest.
The map who starts in as No. 2 in his

FAVORS THE NEW CHARTER
A Letter From Civil Service
Commissioner Roosevelt
of New York.
Views of the Veteran Municipal
Reformer and Chief of Police
of Manhattan Island.
In the latter part of iast month the Mer
chants' Association sent the following let
ter to the New York Civil Service Bureau :
San Francisco, March 2tt, 1896.
Hon. Theodore Roosevelt. President of the Civil
Service Commissioner*, Ktu York Cityâ Dear sir:
I'nder another cover 1 take pleasure in send
ing you a synopsis of the proposed new char
ter for fan Francisco. Tnis charter will be
voted upon at the coming election in Novem
ber, and if ratified by the people will become
the organic law of 'this City, provided it re
ceives a majority of each house of the subse
quent Legislature.
Civil service reform is one of the main fea
tures of this proposed charter. The article
upon civil service \s taken from a similar arti
cle in the charter of the city of Brooklyn, with
which, no doubt, you are familiar. .The conden
sation of the civil service article on page 23 of
this synopsis gives a fair and correct outline of
the article in the original work. This synopsis
is much less than a ttmth oÂ£ the volume of the
original document. In all essential features,
however, it is an accurate compilation.
The Merchants' Association of San Fran
cisco, of which we send you a recent publica
tion, has decided to advocate the adoption of
this proposed new charter for the City. No
community is more in need of such a progres
sive step. "As the rapid advance in the work
of civil service reform is almost solely owing
to the determined efforts of yourself in past
years. we are anxious that you extend to us
the invaluable benefit of your counsel and ad
vice iv this matter.
It would be a crowning victory of your pub
lic career to witness the permanent establish
ment ofcivil service hi every progressive city
of the United States. New \ork City having
succeeded in securing the beneficent results
of civil service reform it is but fitting that Han
Francisco should follow in the footsteps of her
illustrious sister. Sincerely yours,
J. Richard Fkei t d,
Secretary Merchants' Association.
Mr. Roosevelt's answer, which was re
ceived yesterday, is couched in the follow*
ing terms:
New York, March 31, 1896.
/. R. Freud E*q., Mill* liuihUwj, San Fran
cisco, Cat.â MY Deak Sir: I thank you heartily
for your kindness in writing me. lam sure I
need not say how entirely I sympathize with
your purpose and your work. The future of
good government in our great cities depends
upon the disinterested, organized, zealous
work of just such bodies as yours. 1 uui un
fortunately a very busy man now and unable
to get time for the exhaustive study I would
need to make before 1 would bo willing to
pass upon all the points of your charter. The
general scheme seems to me excellent; but I
could not speak of tiie special provisions. I
can, however, very heartily .speaK in favor of
the twelfth article, dealing with the civil ser
vice. It is of vital consequence to good gov
ernment that this article should be incor
porated in your charter. Appointments to the
great bulk of the places under a municipality
should be made as a result of either competi
tive examination, or, in the case of laborers,
of registration ; the examination to be both
practical and relevant and sufficient vouchers
being required to the applicant's good charac
ter. Promotions should be made partly on
seniority and partly on merit, so as to allow an
ambitious and faithful public servant to rise
rapidly. Every consideration of politics or
creed should be ruled out in making either
appointments or dismissals. With great re
gard and best wishes 1 am sincerely yours,
Theodore Roosevelt.

and Ace pt Bonds.
John J. Sullivan, who was appointed a
bond clerk to the District Attorney, will
get no salary for the place he was ex
pected to fill. He applied to the Superior
Court for a writ of mandamus compelling
the Auditor to sign his salary warrants,
and Judge Sanderson has refused to grant
the writ. Sullivan was supposod to re
ceive $100 a month.
The case has been derided on the de
murrer of Auditor Broderick to Sullivan's
application. The Auditor demurred on
the ground, principally, that the facts
stateu were insufficient. On the ground
Judee Sanderson sustained the demurrer,
holding that the Supervisors have no
power to appoint a bond clerk. The court
says that "neither by resolution nor or
dinance has the board, in my judgment,
uny authority to create this office, there
being no legislative grant of authority to
them in that behalf.' 1
Continuing, the court says: "The Judges
of the courts are chargeable with t'ae duty
of examining into and passing upon the
qualifications and responsibility of bonds
men in criminal cases. The Board of Su
pervisors cannot exercise this duty and
it cannot appoint an agent to exercise
powers which it cannot itself, exercise."
A lie travels faster than the truth and
also meets more people on its travels.
JAPANESE IN BUSINESS.
The Little Brown Men Were
but Few in Number Five
Years Ago.
Some Interesting Figures From the
License Office Which Show a
Remarkable Increase.
Not only are the little brown men from
the land of the Mikado making inroads in
various lines of trade by manufacturing
articles in tbelr own country for shipment
abroad, to the detriment of the manufac
turers and white laboring people, but they
are gradually insinuating themselves into
business to the great detriment of the
merchants in the same line of merchand
ising.
This is particularly noticeable in thia
City, and there are those who, watching
the Japanese, have t discovered that they
have in the past five years been slowly but
gradually entering in competition with
the white merchants of San Francisco, and
little by little offering the same class of
goods, and ]in that way securing certain
classes of trade that at one time were good
patronage of white merchants. â¢ .
If they go on increasing lin the various
lines of .^ business in the same ratio that
they have been doing in , five years past ;
they will become a problem that will in'
time not only â¢ occupy. the time of the
Chamber of Commerce and the Board of
Trade but become one of serious considera
tion by the mercantile community. [
.The records of the Licence Office of this
City show that licenses were issued to but
few Japanese in 1891, arid the same records
show the number of these people who ob
tained licenses at the close of 1595 :

TO RUN HOUGH
THE POTRERO
Proposed New Route of the
Southern Pacific
to Baden.
FOR OVERLAND TRAINS.
The Present Circuitous Line via
the San Jose Road to Be
Abandoned.
LESS GRADE AND DISTANCE.
Work to be Commenced as Soon as
the Gap is Closed Between
Elwood and Viaduct.
With the closing of the present cap be- !
tween Viaduct and Elwood on the coast i
division of the Southern Pacific Company, |
the latter will have another through route |
to New Orleans, and one which will enable j
it to run its trains right into San Fran- !
cisco without the delay and extra expense \
of ferriage from Oakland to this sideâ at |
least, those which now come through via
Los Angeles.
But before this can be done to the best
advantage it will be necessary to make a j
change in the road between here and I
Baden. The present one is circuitous and
eteep, and, even with the comparatively
light traffic it is now made to bear, is the
cause of considerable trouble. When the j
through trains of the Southern Pacific I
Raiiroad are brought direct to this side!
of the bay it will mean a much more |
heavier traffic, particularly in the shape of
freight.
This is a problem that has been under
consideration by the company for at least
ten years, and the time has now come !
when it is to be solved.
For some time past the Southern Pacific
hap been quietly buying whole blocks of
land in the Pctrero; here a block, there a
block, and then a block between, and
mostly through dummies, until now, it is
reported to own the entire tier of blocks
between Pennsylvania find lowa streets,
from Center street to islais Creek, and
along this will be a part of the proposed
now route.
Just south of Channel streetis where the
Southern Pacific now has its freight sheds,
and not a long time ago it secured author
ity from the Board of Supervisors to en
tirely close some of the smaller streets in
that vicinity, between Channel and Center
streets, that it might the better utilize its
property for the designed purpose. From
thir point the new rouieto Baden will run,
a>- stated, between Pennsylvania and lowa

States and Canada, Who Was Banqueted by the Local Union Last Evening.

streets, to Islais Creek, then a little west of
south through South San Francisco, cross
ing the county line a few hundred feet east
Of the Six Mile House, thence southerly
through San Mateo County tili it strikes
Baden on the present line.
Thij route will require considerable
tunneling in what are known as the
Black Hills, and in other. respects will be
costly, though it will not be more than
seven miles all told. On the present route
the distance to Baden is about ten miles.
The great benefit will come, however,
from the actual distance saved ; it will, be
derived from the easier grade. and the
consequent decreased cost of ' operating.
With the same power it will be possible to
haul much longer and heavier trains, and
without danger of their breaking apart, as
they now fiequently do between here and
Baden: â  . '.; ."â  y.'
Nothing is now in the way of this work
being at once commenced except the lack
of rea'iy money. All the rights of way
have been secured, ami the plan? are vir
tually in shape to allow a construction
force to be put in the field at short notice.
It is not the purpose, however, to start on
this work until the gap of some s|Jxty or
seventy miles between Elwood and Via
duct is closed. This wori, too, is delayed
by the inability to get hold of ready
money. But as soon as U. P. Huntington
its able to raise sufficient funds both pro
jects that will give the Southern Pacific
Railroad trains direct entrance to San
Francisco will be Dushed with the greatest
vieor.
When the coast route is completed the
time between here and Santa Barbara,
which is now about twenty-seven hours,
will be cut in half, and the trains that
leave here at 7 :30 a. m. will reach there at
9 p. m., making the trip to that city possi
ble by daylight. It is expected that this
shortening of the time will also tend to
give San Francisco considerable of the
business of Santa Barbara aud that sec
tion that now goes East and elsewhere.
Among other changes that it is reported
will come with this change of route to
Baden is the establishment of carshops
and a roundhouse on the l. r >Oo-aore tract of
Jand bordering the proposed route on the
east of the Potrero-Viejo district.
YOSEMITE PARK.
Proposed Surrender of the Trust Will
Be Considered by the Com
missioners.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the Yosemite Valley Commissioners
was called to convene yesterday, but was
postponed by order of the chairman a few
hours before the appointed time of assem
bly. Governor Budd, who happened to be
in the City, sauntered in to attend the
meeting, and was somewhat disappointed
to hear of the postponement.
There are two vacancies on the board to
be filled by appointment of the Governor.
At the next full meeting of the board
the subject of recommending that the
Legislature shall surrender the trust of
managing the park to the United States
Government will be discussed. The senti
ment of the commission, so far as can be
ascertained, is against secession, but a
strong appeal will be made for larger ap
propriations of State money to protect
and improve the reservation.
The board will also be asked at the next
meeting to indorse the proposed railway
along the Merced River to the Cascades.
GLASS BLOWERS BANQUET
-The Local Union Entertains
Their International Pres
ident.
Prosperous Condition of the Organi
zation in the United States
and Canada.
Joseph D. Troth, grand president of the
Glass-Bottle Blowers of the United States
and Canada, who is making the round of
the local unions of the order, was enter
tained at a banquet at the Oberon Res
taurant last evening.
The meeting was presided o^fer by Presi
dent J. H. Schich of Branch 22 of the or
ganization. About forty members ware
present, including James McDermott, vice
president; Phil J. Diez, recording secre
tary; John Terrals, linancial secretary;
and John Thomas, treasurer.
In response to the toast to the grand
president Mr. Troth spoke of his
work among the different branches
of the organization and the prosper
ous condition in which he found
them. He paid a generous compliment to
the Pacific Coast, and especially to this
State. During the evening speeches were
made by different member? of the order.
Mr. Troth in an interview stated that his
special mission was to collect data regard-
ing the foreign importation of glassware.
"I want to find out," said he, "just how
many bottles are sent into the United
States from other countries, and then I
will he in Washington when the next
tariff legislation comes up. We did pretty
well in the Wilson bill, but there is a
chance for further improvement. I have
heard, but don't know now true the report
is, that importers get a big rebate on
empty bottles. You know they used to
come over filled with water as ballast, but
that was knocked out. Anything like a
rebate on a dutiable article is contrary to
law.
"The glass - bottle blowers have no
trouble just now in the matter of wages,
as every year our workmen meet the man
facturers, and the wage scale is fixed.
About five months ago we had a hot seven
months' strike. We shut up seventeen
out of twenty-three big factories and
spent $123,000, and when we won we bad
$20,000 in the treasury."
Grand President Troth is a resident of
the State of New Jersey, and has been an
active worker in "the organization
since his boyhood. The manufacture
of glass bottles in this country
has been steadily growing notwithstand
ing the large foreign importation. With
protective tariff legislation the young in
dustry will assume greater importance.
Mr. Troth will depart for the East in a few
days, visiting the principal cities in the
West on his way to Philadelphia, the
headquarters of the organization.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 1896.
SHE RETURNS IN ARTIST
Miss Carrie Bowes, Mayor Sutro's
Protege, Is at Home
Again.
STUDIED LONG IN GERMANY.
Her Masters Declare Her to Be a
Remarkably Accomplished
Pianist.
Miss Carrie Bowes, Mayor Sutro's favor
ite protege, and who is expected ere long
to astonish the musical world with her
piano playing, slipped quietly into town a
few days ago after an absence in Europe of
over four years, and is now resting from
her arduous studies and preparing for a
concert tour that will begin some time this
fall.
Five years aeo, when Miss Bowes was a
child of fourteen, her tastÂ« for music and
her skillful touch for one so young at
tracted the attention of musical critics in
this City. Mayor Sutro heard of her play-
MISS CARRIE BOWES, MAYOR SUTRO'S MUSICAL PROTEGE.
[From a photograph.]
ing, and after being present at one of the |
performances decided that it would be a ;
! misfortune to the child if she was not per- ,
mitted to study under the best masters
and fit herself for the career of a pianist.
The family not being nnancially able to in- j
cur the great expense necessary for such \
an undertaking Mr. Sutro concluded to
foot the bills himself, and as soon a? she
was ready to travel Miss Bowes was on her
way to German y.
There her manifest talent at once at
tracted the attention of the German artists,
and sne was admitted to the Koyal High!
School of Music in Berlin, an honor sel- 1
dom accorded one so youthful.
For three years she was assiduous in her
studies and won much approbation from
her masters. Then Professor Dolbier ad
vised her to go to Leipsic and place herself
under the instruction of Professor Krause,
one of the foremost teachers of Germany.
Here her progress was equally rapid, and
ere long by special favor sne was permitted
to play to select audiences. Those often
contained such great artists as d'Albert,
Carreno, Gruenfeld, Paver, Sapellnikoff,
Sophie Mer.ter and others. She also
played at court soirees before the Duke of
Altenberg. Saxony, and in concert in Ber
lin, Dresden, Leipsic and other cites.
She was pronounced a remarkably ac
complished pianist by all who heard her
play.
Since returning to America Miss Bowes
has appeared in concert in Chicago and
other Eastern cities, wiiere her playing
was commented on in the most favorable
terms by the critics and the musical press.
Miss Bowes shines particularly in the
creations of Bach, Raff. Chopin and Liszt,
though the works of all the masters are At
the command of her touch, which is de
scribed by musical enthusiasts as firmly
masculine, with all the delicacy which a j
woman can use. Her rendition of the
fugue is particularly commented on, while
answer and counter subject are clearly de
hned and all points of imitation faithfully
executed.
Miss Bowes in person is handsome with
a queenly carriage and expressive eyes
that sparkle with sympatuy with lier
music as she plays.
She is essentially a San Francisco girl
and expresses herself as being charmed in
returning to her brother and widowed
mother with whom she resides and to the
benefactor who rendered her career as a
pianist possible.
JOHN SWETT IS HONORED
His Medallion Portrait in Bronze
Unveiled Last
Evening.
The Teachers of San Francisco Pro
vide the Likeness of the Vet
eran Instructor.
The handsome medallion portrait of
John Swett, the former Superintendent of
Public Schools, that was provided for and
presented to the School Department by
the teachers of San Francisco, was un
veiled last evening in the rooms of the
Superintendent, in the City Hall, in the
presence of a large number of teachers and
their friends.
The apartments were handsomely deco
rated with lilies, roses and other delicate
flowers, some of the appointments of the
room being almost bidden by the blos
soms. The medailion hung in the place it
will in future occupy over the mantel in
the Superintendent's office, and was
shrouded in a drapery of silk until Chair
man Mann called the gathering to order
and after a brief address in which he eulo
gized the retired official in the highest
terms and Bpoke of his forty years' service
as an instructor, drew the covering from
the portrait. When tne audience
had sufficiently admired it Mr.
Swett, who was present, was called
upon for an address and spoke
in a vein of quiet humor that pleased the
audience immensely. At the close he ex
pressed the utmost gratitude and appre
ciation of the honor bestowed upon him
and thanked the teachers heartily for
their kindly remembrance of him. * Dur
ing his service in the department Mr.
Swett held the positions of State Superin
tendent of Schools, City Superintendent of
Schools for two terms and principal of the
Normal and High schools.
The bronze portrait, which was executed
by Douglas Tiiden, the deaf and dumb
sculptor, is a striking likeness of the vet
eran teacher, it rests against a back
ground of black marble and is surrounded
by a laurel wreath, also in bronze.
NEW PENSION RULING.
All Oaths fop Touchers Mmt Now Be
Taken by Notaries or County
Clerks.
What was designed to make things more
comfortable and convenient for the veteran
soldier of the East on the pension list of
Uncle Sam is likely to have just the con
trary effect on the pensioner of the Coast.
On March 24 last an act was passed by
Congress abolishing personal pension pay
ments of every character, revoking the
authority of pension agents and clerks to
administer oaths in the execution of pen
sion vouchers and requiring all checks to
be transmitted to pensioners by mail.
Under the old method of personal pay
ments it was no unusual thing to see a
long line of aged veterans, widows and
orphans stretched along the street in front
of the Pension Office during weather that
made it a hardship for even a strong man
to be out of doors, and this act was passed
to obviate the necessity for exposure of
this kind in the East, in this City, how-
ever, no such hardship can arise in view
of our mild climate, and the new law will
simply cause the pensioner in this district
the extra work of uoing to the County
Clerk's office or to a notary's and executing
bis pension voucher.
There are about 4000 pensioners who
draw their stipend in this City, the dates
of payment being on the 4th of March,
June, September- and December, respect
ively. One enterprising notary has al
ready issued a circular offering to execute
pension vouchers for 25 cents a set, and
many will probably take advantaee of this
offer rather than have to wait in line at the
County Clerk's office, where the pen
sioner can do his swearing without charge.
SAYS THE TAX IS VALID
Judge Coffey's Decision in the
Suit of the Stanford
Heirs.
The Law Is Not Unjust, Nor Does It
Discriminate Unduly Be
tween Legatees.
Judge Coffey has decided that the col
lateral heirs to the Stanford estate must
pay the inheritance tax. It was contended
that the law was unconstitutional, but
Judge Coffey has declared otherwise. His
decision is upon the lines of a similar one
rendered in the litigation of the estate of
J. Clute Wilmerding.
The tax due from the Stanford heirs is
$237,500. It was contendsd that the law
was discriminating, in that it taxed cer
tain heirs and passed over others, and also
in that it made the court the collector of
the tax, when the constitution requires all
taxes to be collected by the Tax Collector.
Judge Coffey sets aside both these con
tentions, for he saw nothing in the consti
tution which forbids the tax. Continuing
in regard to the tax itself he says :
"The inheritance tax in general may be
regarded as a limitation of inheritance,
especially between collateral relations, but
it may be sufficiently well justified from
the standpoint of pure finance. It accords
as well as any other one tax with the
principle of ability, and it serves as a suc
cessful adjunct to other taxes in bringing
about justice in the fiscal system as a
whole. It should be added that it is thor
oughly practicable; it is difficult to evade,
and large amounts of revenue are obtained
from it without any perceptible disturb
ance of industry. No tax is less oppressive
or paid with Jess unwillingness. Iso tax ia
better adapted to replace the antiquated
personal property tax."
HARRISON SCHOOL.
Special Exercises in Honor of the Xi-
President's Marriage.
When General Harrison was elected
President of the United States the name of
the Grove-street School was changed to
the Harrison School out of compliment to
him.
Yesterday special exercises were held in
the school, which was crowded with pa
rents and friends of the pupils, in honor
of the marriage of the ex- President and
Mrs. Dimmick.
The exercises, which were specially un
der the superintendence of Miss McElroy,
the principal, consisted of a recitation vy
Mrs. Gannon's class, a recitation by Miss
Gallagher's class, song by Miss Cullen's
class, recitation by Miss McConn ell's class,
and songs, "Flag of the Free," "Ben
Bolt," "Mill May" and "Hide Behind the
Door," by the third, fourth and fifth
grades. There was also a grand march at
2 p. m.
The school was gayly decorated for the
occasion and a most enjoyable time was
spent by the pupils and visitors.

BASS, PIKE AND PERCH
Sacramento River Is Stocked
With Fishes From a Lake
Near San Diego.
ENEMIES OF THE BONY CARP.
The Sportsmen's Association's Annual
Live-Bird Shooting Contests in
Oakland.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Wilson and
Cross returned last Friday from Lake
Cuyamach, in San Diego County, with a
consignment of fish composed of forty
seven large-mouth black bass, fifty yellow
ring percti and five banded pickerel, all of
which were immediately planted in the
Sacramento River, near the town of An
derson.
Deputy Wilson said that the bass were
in splendid condition, and that several of
the females will spawn within a month.
"The lake from which the fish were
taken is three miles in length and about
two miles wide," said Deputy Wilson,
"and when we reached it a strong wind
was blowing, making it a difficult task to
draw the net in many promising places.
We made several hauls in the sheltered
covep, and I was surprised with the good
success that crowned our efforts.
"Some large bass of four and five pounds
weight were captured, but they were im
mediately returned to the lake, as they
were lartrer than we desired for transpor
tation purposes. Thirty-one bass taken
scaled about 2% pounds each, and the re
mainder weighed something less. They
are beautiful fish, and will flourish in that
part of the Sacramento River in which
they were planted.
"After we mane the first haul of the net
I suggested to my companion that we pros
pect another cove not far away, but he
said. 'Give this spot another trial,' and to
my surprise our capture was even greater
than before.
"I was convinced that the lake is liter
ally alive with bass, all of which are, I
think, in splendid condition. Of the num
bers taKen "with a few hauls of tne net only
one fish died en route to its destination,
and this poor unfortunate "kicked the
bucket" on account of having swallowed a
small piece of ice which he evidently had
mistaken for some kind of food ; doubtless
the poor fellow was veiy hungry and took
desperate chances.
"1 expect that within five minutes after
they were given tneir freedom in the Sac
ramento River they made matters very in
teresting for the young hardmouths and
carp â fishes of no value.
"The pickerel and perch were also liber
ated in the Sacramento. The pickerel is
a tblerably good table fish, but the prin
cipal object in placing them In the river is
to reduce the numbers of carp, the young
of which will find resting-places in the
stomachs of the 'picks.' The perch is a
splendid table hsh and will afford jrood
sport to anglers who will visit tnat sec
tion of the country a few years hence."
Deputies Wilson and Cross left last
evening for a second trip to the lake in
question and they hope to return with a
much larger consignment of bass, which
will be placed in Clear Lake, Lake County.
A. E. Lovett and Mr. Bentley fished the
headwaters of the Lagunitas Creek last
Friday and Saturday with very gratifying
results. The anelers basketed 374 trout,
some of which were of good size. The
brown hackle and Shumaker flies proved
to be the killers.
Owing to the high and discolored condi
tion of the streams, subsequent to the
heavy rainstorm, very little trout fishing
will be done during the present week.
Should the weather remain fine, the
creeks will be in tolerably fair condition
for bait-fishing on Sunday next. Experi
enced anglers say that the sudden rise of
the streams at this time will carry the
small fishes to the salt water and thereby
destroy what promised to be a good, early
season for trout-fishing.
Messrs. Watt, Cooper and Walker caught
some nice trout in Calaveras Creek last
Saturday, but on the foiiowing day they
caught the same as many others, viz.,
more water than fish.
Wild pigeons'are said to be numerous in
the hills near Point Reyes. Harry Weise
shot at some of the passing flocks last
Sunday, but the hea---y wind carried the
shot in a wrong direction, and the sports
man returned home disgusted.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
will meet this evening at 220 Mason street
to make final arrangements for the picnic
which will bÂ«Â» held next Sunday at Schuet
zen Park, San Rafael. Several cummittees
will be appointed and much business will
be transacted; consequently a large at
tendance is expected.
The Cordelia Gun Club, or Preserve
Club, as which it is better known, intends
to make another tight for the exclusive
shooting privileges of a certain tract of
land in the Suisun marshes. Notice has
been given of the club's intention to move
for a new trial of the suit in which Judge
Buckles of Solano County decided last
winter that iheclub members had no ex
clusive shooting right on the property
which it leases. If a new trial is refused
the case will be carried to the Supreme
Court as a final stand against the alleged
poachers of Solano County.
The Reliance Gun Club has issued its
programme for the season. The club
matches will be held on the tirst Sundays
in April, May. June, July and August at
Alameda Point. Members who compete
in the five shoots will be divided into five
classes and cash prizes will be awarded.
The final competitions will be held on the
first Sunday in September. The free-for
all races will be held on the fourth Sun
days in April, May, June, July and Au
gust at Alameda Point.
The annual live-bird shooting contests of
the State Sportsmen's Association will
commence on Friday next at the Oakland
track and will continue until Sunday. If
the weather is fine a large attendance will
be present.
READY FOR ASHWORTH.
Folsom Street People Expect to Show
That There Are Funds.
The Folsom-street property-owners and
those interested in the completion of the
pavement on that street from Sixth to
Third intend to leave no stone unturned
until they bring about the appropriation
of $8800 necessary for the work.
The executive committee of the Folsom
street Improvement Club is not satisfied
with the statement of Supervisor Hughes,
chairman of the Street Committee, that
there are no funds available, and hied yes
terday a petition with the board, asking
that action on the bill be deferred and that
the whole matter be referred to the Street
Committee.
The Folsom-street committee will inter
view Mr. Ashworth to-day with the view
of getting a statement from him. In
the event of his claiming a lack of funds
the committee will endeavor, by force of
certain arguments which they "hold in
readiness, to convince the Street Superin
tendent that the finding of the necessary
amount will be a just and easy under
taking.
Fortised by the results of this interview
with Mr. Ashworth the committee will
come before the Supervisors next Thurs
day and ask that the contract be awarded
for finishing the remaining three blocks.
MiMcalcnlated the Depth.
C. R. Jones, 808 Filbert street, was at the
Sutro Baths yesterday afternoon. Thinking
that the water was eight feet deep, he jumped

struct the bottom so hnrd that he broke both
bones of his left leg. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital.

STREET BRIDGE
Alameda Citizens Will Pre
sent a Petition To-
Day.
MAY MODIFY THE PLANS
Belief That the Bridge Advo
cates Will Agree to a
Compromise.
HARRISON STREET FAVORED.
No Alameda Opposition to a Single
Bridge if the Approaches Are
Not Changed.
A. petition, signed by the Webster- street
property-owners and business men and
by many members of that locality, will be
presented to Colonel Suter, the Govern
ment engineer, io-day, asking that no
change be made in the location of the
bridge uniting Oakland and Alameda.
The petition recites that the abandonment
of the Webster-street bridge and the estab
lishment of a new highway near the
estuary at the Alice-street line would be a
preat detriment to the business and prop
erty interests of the western portion of
Alameda, and that such a change would
be an unjust and arbitrary interference
with the rights attached to the natural
order of Alameda's growth.
The petition has several hundred signa
tures, it is stated, and if the petition
have no effect the petitioners propose to
take the matter into the courts.
On account of the opposition to the Alice
tfcPherson street route it is believed
that the plans suggested a week ago may
se modified so that Webster street may re
main the highway between Oakland and
Alameda, as at present.
From Santa Clara avenue in Alameda the
roadway swerves awa3' to the westward
order to meet the Webster-street bridge.
The main portion of Webster street in
lameda is almost on a line with Alice
street. Oakland, or as nearly, in line with
itter street as with the Oakland Web
reet. Consequently, the West End
ts of Alameda insist that if there is
to be a union bridge at Alice street the
connerting highway in Alameda should
Blill be Webster street.
they say. the Southern t Pacific
..re line could run to the Alice-
Ige without crossing the main
thoroughfare. With "Webster street, Ala
ending at the Alice-street bridge
tracks could be extended
c street without being any more in
ay than they are now in reaching the
Wi hster bridge. The broad-gau>;e road
would approach the bridge from the east
ern side and there would be no trouble
w iih the crossings at all.
Such a plan i*s that is spoken of with
favor by representatives of all the inter
est? that center at the bridge. The Web
ster-street people, however, would still
prefer to have the new bridge placed on
the site of the county's present structure.
A compromise on Harrison street, midway
between the Webster-street and Alice
street bridges, is spoken of.
D. L. Shead, an Alameda grocer at 1519
Webster street, Alameda, said yesterday
when asked about the opposition to the
proposed Alice-street bridge:
"I have signed the petition objecting to
the change from the present route because
the change brings haruship and injustice
to us who have built up this part of the
city. The change would mean an un
necessary e&pen&e to the city in building
the approaches to the bridge, while in the
present location the roadway to the bridge
:-. established.
"If they agree to leave the route to Oak
land as it is at present, with the business
i Webster street as the highway to a
new bridge at Alice street or Harrison
street, that is another matter. We want a
new bridge, but we want to protect our
own business interests. . The Webster
slough will be hard to fill, and it
might be better to have the street straight
ened so as to run to the Alice-street bridge,
as it should have been run originally. I
think that Hajrison street or Alice street
would be a better location for the proposed
bridge, provided that the highway re
mained at Webster street.' '
The same views were expressed by sev
eral other business men of the digtrict.
Among these, Adolph Heckerof 1535 Web-
ster street, a hardware-dealer, said:
"This business region has been built up
in accordance with the route of thorough
fare between Alameda and Oakland. This
part of the city has been bujlt up by the
enterprise of the West End people, who
expected that the conditions would be
permanent and who believed that they
would be protected in their existing rights.
"There ought to be only one bridge, and
that a good one, where now there are two
very poor bridges. But if a new bridge is
to be built the route to Oakland ought to
remain jugt as it is. We will all favor a
new bridge, anywhere from Webster street
to Alice street, provided that the promi
nence of our business street is not inter
fered with."
Theo. F. Steinmetz, the West End fur
niture-dealer, said: "If they take our
bridge away that will end this part of
town. But if they give us a better bridge
and let Webster street be the approach to
it, as it ought naturally t,o be the approach
to Alice-stree: bridge, then the change will
only be a benefit to us. It would be
wrong, though, to make a radical change
of t\.e conditions under which the West
End has been built up."
W. G. Curtis, the head of the Southern Pa
cific Company's engineering department,
stated to a Call reporter yesterday that
the company is preparing to go ahead and
rebuild its Aiice-street bridge with the
intention of running the two railroads
over it. "The attitude of the county will
have nothing to do with that project. If
the county concludes in favor of an ar
rangement for building a bridge that will
answer all the purposes of the two present
bridges the company is willing to enter
into the negotiations." Mr. Curtis said that
he thought a bridge at Harrison street
would be as convenient for the railroad as
a bridge at Alice street.
Oakland has taken no definite action yet
in the bridge matter, but the shipping
men in that city are in favor of one less
drawbridge.
Hi- Fifth Attempt.
John Jackson, a laborer, attempted to commit
â¢ulcide in his room at Hackmeier's Hotel early
yesterday morning, by turningon the gas. He
said he had trouble with his wife, which caused
him i to make the attempt. Mrs. Jackson called
at the hospital and stated that she would swear
out a warrant to have her husband taken be
fore the Insanity Commissioners for examina
tion, as he had attempted suicide four times be-

NOE LAND SUIT SWINDLE
Unsuspecting Property â¢ Owners
Duped by. Fraudulent
Quitclaims.
Noe Heirs to Make an Announcement
to the Public Denouncing
the "Job."
A pew, startling and wholly unexpected
development was brought to light yester
day in the $10,000,000 Noe land suit, first
given to the public in the columns of The
Call.
The suit, which, in certain quarters, was
at first regarded as a scheme for extorting
money from property-owners in the San
Miguel Rancho, has since secured a stand
ing in the courts, and suspected persons
are taking advantage of that fact to swin
die some timid landholders out of thou
sands of dollars.
Some weeks ago it was suspected that
some one was profiting secretly by this
suit. Several of the owners of the smaller
holdings were said to have been furnished
quitclaim deeds to their land on payment
of money ranging all the way from $2 50 to
$50 and $100 to a fraudulent representative
of the !Noe heir*, it was impossible at the
time to trace the rascaliy traffic to its
fountainhead, and, it remained for Mr.
Hamlin of the Whitney Lawbook Pub
lishing Company to confirm the suspicion
and all but identify the guilty persons yes
terday morning.
Mr, Hamlin and the representatives of
the Noe heirs would say nothing further
than that the man who has traded on the
credulity of the unsuspecting land
owners to the extent of several thousand
dollars is a broken-down attorney doing
business in the 400 block on Montgomery
street. The name, they said, will be made
public later on.
The scheme was ample in its shrewd
ness. Those, selected for victims were
among the poorer, and, in many instances,
the more legally unenlightened classes.
They were informed that the expense of
a lonar and costly litigation could be ob
viated by the purchase of quitclaim
deeds, the cost of which in all cases de
pended on the ready and available cash
possessions of the persons addressed.
When the swindle was brought to the
attention of the Noe heirs they authorized
their legal representatives to publicly de
nounce the swindler and proclaim that no
one, lawyer or layman, had been empow
ered to give or furnish, for cash or other
wise, deeds, quitclaims or releases.
Acting oh those instructions P. L. Kos
cialowski has prepared the following state
ment, which will be made public to-day:
In justice to the defendants in that certain
case now pending iv the courts known as the
Noe suit, I deem it proper to state that it has
been reported to me that certain persons are
advertising themselves as agents for the Noe
heirs, and inviting the said defendants to come
and see them with a view of buying quitclaim
deeds, and that such persons have collected
money from certain defendants. The said Noe
heirs deny that such person or persons is or
are authorized to act for them. They have no
agents, cappers, solicitors or go-betweens of
any kind, sort or character, and they warn the j
defendants to not pay any one any sum what
ever on their behalf. They have not, do not
and never, will ask any defendant or defenda
nts to purchase their title, and any statement
made by any one to the contrary is absolutely
false and without iouadauou. I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 1896.
"OLD GLORY" FLOATS HIGH
Surmounts the Statue on the
Dome of the New City
Hall.
CAPTAIN SMITH PLACED IT.
Higher Than a Flag Was Ever
Placed on a Building West
of the Rockies.
High above the nearly completed statue
that surmounts the dome of the City Hall,
and higher than any flag was ever raised
on any building west, of the Rockies, "Old
Glory" floats proudly in the breeze, and
will remain there until the scaffolding
that now surrounds the statue is removed
and the figure accepted by the City Hall
Commission.
Several weeks ago the Commissioners
decided to place a flag over the statue as
soon as the last piece had been placed and
bolted and Smith & Son, the riggers, were
employed to do the work.
Owing to the great elevation and the
difficulty of hoisting a proper staff and
other paraphernalia to the top of the dome
the job was one that few firms were will
ing to undertake and the senior member
of the firm that took the contract decided
to look after the matter himself, though
he has almost reached man's allotted
"three score years and ten." He saw that
the tackle was without a flaw ana that the
stout stick from which the flag was to
float was a perfect piece and without
cracks. When all was in readiness he
climbed to th^ top of the great coppered
dome and superintended the lashing of
the staff to the upraised arm that holds
the torch.
Then the great flag, nineteen feet in
length, was made fast to the halliards and
unfurled. Owing to the weight of the flag
and staff and the great force exerted by
the wind at that altitude the fastenings of
both bunting and staff were of the .strong
est and considerable anxiety was felt at
first regarding the ability of the statue to
stand the strain. Everything held, how
ever, and the flag is visible from almost
every section of the City.
The distance from the flag to the street
is something over 340 feet.
ABOUT HALLUCINATIONS
Dreams and Hypnotism Discussed
at the Academy of
Sciences.
Dr. Frank Angell Gives Scientific
Reasons for These Mental
Vagaries.
Dr. I rank Angell delivered an interest
ing lecture last night in the hall of the
Academy of Sciences on '"The Scientific ;
Basis of Hallucinations." While it would '
appear from this title that Dr. Angell's dis
course ruight be a flight in the higher do
main of psychology, the lecture was one
which fascinated all who were present.
So it was a decidedly agreeable surprise to
those who leaned toward the popular style
of discussing scientific matters.
The lecturer stated that psychical activ
ity was always accompanied with a flow of
blood to the head. By wav of illustration
he said : "Place a man flat upon a board
evenly balanced while his mind is not oc
cupied. Then tell him to recite, say the I
multiplication table. The instant he bo
gins his task the board will tip over with
the side on which his head rests lower
than the opposite end, showing conclu
sively that the psychical activity pro
duced in a mere recital of the multiplica
tion table causes the blood to flow to his
head."
Dr. Anjjell told several entertaining
things about dreams. He said that ali
dreams started out from some sensation,
and they developed themselves from that
sensation. Then he described the dream of I
a certain psychologist. This gentleman I
dreamt he was hoeing in a garden, and a
dense fog enveloped the garden. Even the
hoe was clouded, nothing but the hand
having remained in sight. The dreamer
on waiting found his hand raised in an
awkward position and half closed, with a
sensation of pressure from, a wrinkle on
the paliii. It was from the pressure that
his dream came, and so all dreams have
been traced to definite ; sources â pressure
dreams to weight of bedclothes upon some
portion of the body, falling dreams to
breathing, flying dreams to something in
the chest, to breathing.
"And yet they are as lively, as vivid as
our real life," remarked the lecturer,
"though our will power is not present."
In the somnambulist dream a person
performed feats which he could not at
tempt in his normal, waking state, such as
climbing walls, etc.
Hypnotism, animal magnetism, mes
merism, electro-biology â all belonged to
one and the same thing. They were hyp
notic dreams. In the "so-called magic
phenomenon of hypnotism," as Dr. Angell
exnressed it, the frequently extraordinary
development of power was due to the fact
that the mental powers were concentrated
in one sense. The hypnotic state had al
most as many conditions as life itself. It
began with a very light sleep and deep
ened to the somnambulist stage.
TlÂ»e majority of people, he said, could be
hypnotized if they gave themselves up to
it. Suggestion and not the power of one
mind over another did the work. Sug
gestion might fail once or twice, but would
prevail in the end.
Phenomena in sleeps were explained. In
one instance a mother Â§lept soundly while
surrounded by all manner of distracting
noises, but woke instantly at the cry of her
babe. She had gone to sleep with a cer
tain definite mental relation to the child.
It was no doubt the maternal sense of pro
tection, but the faint cry caused her to
wake. Another phenomenon is waking
exactly at a certain hour, which 13 pos
sible from the mental relation to the fact
of waking at that time. In a ward of a
French hospital a doctor said aloud at
night: "Sleep on; wake in five minutes."
The sleepers all jumped up in five
minutes. Their condition, was changed
from ordinary "night sleep" to the hyp
notic state through suggestion.
Dr. David Starr Jordan presided, and the
hall was well filled. The lecturer was ap
piauded at the conclusion of his discourse.
For the Use of Dogs.
A toilet club for the use of dog 3 has been
opened in Bond street, London, and they
say it is an interesting experience to go
through the splendidly fitted up room de
voted to the shaving and shampooing of
Eet dogs, while little cold, hungry and
omeless boys and girls are trudging
through the streets outside.

HOW TO BE CHEERFUL.
Driving Away Sallowness, Nervousness
and Irritable Feelings.
"Laugh and grow fat" is an old saying which
means that there is a very close connection
between a cheerful mind and a sound body.
Everybody knows that this is true, but how
many people there are who find it impossible
to be light-hearted! They are always wrapped
in gloom, they grow pale, sallow and prema
turely old because they are constantly suffering
from dyspepsia, eoustipation and tired, neiv
ous, irritable feelings.
Is there any way in which such people can
improve their health and feel happier? Yes,
most decidedly there is. Many people have
fortunately discovered the secret ot health and
happiness and are giving others the benefit of
their experience.
Mrs. J. W. Connor of Fitchburg, Mass.. re
cently said: "I was in bad health and feeling
very miserable and low-spirited when a friend
advised me to try Duffy's pure malt whiskey.
I did so and am now feeling stronger and hap
pier and healthier than I hare felt in years. It
has worked wonders, and I think it is a grand,
good thing."
Mr. W. C. Wilcox of Utlca. N. V., says: "I
have been using Duffy's pure malt whiskey for
indigestion and shortness of breath, ana am
happy to say that I have been greatly benefited.
I have also induced my friends to try it with
equally good results."
There is nothing like Duffy's pure malt for
toning up the system, quickening the circula
tion aud giving bright, healthy looks to worn
out faces. Every grocer and druggist keeps it,
but care should be taken to guard against infe
rior imitations. When you ask for Duffy's puiQ
malt whiskey be sure that you get it and accept
nothing else. There is nothing that can pro
duce the same effect*.

Financial.
NEW YORK, K. V., April 6.â Speculation at
the stock Exchange was strong and higher at the
rarly session and weak and lower in the late after
noon trading. The improvement at the start was
equal to 'â ;:"-' 4 percent. Manhattan, Tennessee
Coal and Iron, Colorado Fuel and the grangers
were the most prominent In the upward move
ment. Manhattan advanced to 110 on reports
that neeotlations were progressing looking to the
leasing of the road to the New York Central. Di
rector Sage, while admitting that there was some
thlng in the talk about a deal, refused to give any
of the details.
Tennessee Coal and Iron, Illinois Steel and
other iron and steel srocks were in request on the
improved outlook for the trade. Tennessee Coal
advanced 1% to 32: Illinois ateel 13 /8 to 71, and
Colorado Fuel 2*4 to *)'*â¢ In the industrial
croup Sugar was conspicuous for strength, rising
.to 1 191 -, while Tobacco was feverish at 87%@8Â».
1 he usual methods of the management of late
nave hurt the market for the stock and operators
are giving it a wine berth. In the. late trading
. weakness prevailed, and the early gains were gen
â¢â¢ralli- lost, the market having been adversely af
. fected by the jiassage of the Cuban resolutions by I
Hie House. J !
Reports of serious damage to wheat in the
Western States and the continued strength of
sterling exchange also caused a weak feeling The.
engagement of 9800.000 gold for shipment to Eu
rope to-morrow, announced in the day. singularly '
. enough had no influence on speculation. In the
reaction .Manhattan, the Grangers, Tennessee
Coal, Colorado Fuel and General Electric scored
the heaviest losses. The market cloned weak in

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, It.i.. April 6.â State crop reports
and the proximity of the - Government's estimate
were the points that governed the action of wheat
to-day. Occasional diversion was, however, due
to the figures on stock, etc. The opening was
strong and higher on Ohio's and Missouri's con
dition, 75 and 77 respectively. The visible supply
rather held the bull, enthusiasm In check for a
time, the indications and final rise not being con
| ducive to buying. It showed a decrease of 72(3,000
bushels. There were no cables from English or
i Continental market s. the holiday continuing
j abroad. Receipts in the Northwest were light at
I 376 cars, against 535 last Monday and 263 a year
t ago. Chicago received 20 cars and inspected out
196,607 bushels. Unofficial figures on the world's
I shipments and the amount on ocean pa.ssuge made
! the former 4,Â« 3 -0.000 bushels and showed a de
crease in the latter 01 968.000 bushels. Owing to
the holiday in England the Board of Trade figures
1 were not received. Export clearances amounted
' to 398.336 bushels. Private cables received about
j noon quoted a strong feeling abroad, Chicago ad
j vancing sharply on the intelligence. . The Liver
! pool corn trade news estimated stocks to be dnÂ»wn
; from until September 1 at 80.000.000 bushels less
: than a year ago. JlÂ»v wheat, opened from 6ftc to
65 14 c, sold between 64!}it064% and 66y B e, clos
ing at 66 ;1 /4(*Â£66" / 8 c > 3%c higher than Saturday.
I Estimated receipts for to-morrow. 23 cars.
CORNâ Continued to be ruled by the action of
j wneat. There were no signs or symptoms of a re-
I rival of activity, and few profess to look for In
i dependent or Important chaoses In the near
future. Receipts were 157 cars. There was no
! corn taken from store. Export clearances wen 1
147.331 bushels. The visit. supply increased
! 459.000 bushels. May corn opened at 29%t*Â£29'r/BC,

-1 ceipts tor to-morrow are 812 cars.
1 OATSâ Exhibited firmness, but no particular
1 feature was seen in the trade. An ordinary bust
ness was transacted, the tone and sentiment of
I wheat contributing to the similar tone in oats.
. Receipts were 121 cars, and 30,000 bushels were
! taken from store. The visible supply Increased
' 494,000 bushels. May oats closed & 8 c dinner thau

YOUTHFUL WIFE
Special Detective Landis Is
Now on a Voyage to
Alaska.
A BRIEF MARRIED LIFE
The Heart- Broken Young Woman
Tries to End Her Existence
With Poison.
A VICTIM OF INGRATITUDE.
Worked for Her Husband While He
Was in Jail, and Is Repaid
With Desertion.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
DOS Broadway, April 6. )
Mrs. Carrie Landi*, a young bride of less
than a year, is deserted. When she real
ized her pitiable plight she resorted to
poison as a means to end her misery, but
the speedy intervention of friends pre
vented her from ending her existence, and
in a few days she will return to her mother
at Stockton with her short experience of
married life nothing but a chapter of past
h istpry.
When she came to Oakland and married
< . A. Landis there was every prospect of a
happy future. Landis was a hard-working
man, and many there were who envied
him his pretty young wife. When work
ceased the husband met with great diffi
culty in satisfying the necessities of life,
and was recommended to Chief Lloyd as a
reliable man to do detective work. The
Chief put Landis to work on liquor ordi
nance cases. It was his duty to procure
evidence of where liquor was sold without
a license, and although lie secured several
conviction's he was at last indicted for
perjury by the Grand Jury.
While in prison his little wife went to
work canvassing, and the few dollars that
she succeeded in earning were mostly
spent for the comfort of her husband in
jail. Her devotion to him was very
marked and she was a frequent visitor to
the County Jail. About a month ago he
was acquitted on the charge of perjury,
and for a couple of weeks the pair were re
united.
" Landi? went to work as a canvasser and
met with some success, but he realized
that he had made too many enemies to do
well in this city and he soon found him
self with nothing' to do. About a week j
ago he told his wife that he had been told j
by an officer that he was to be again ar
rested. His wife believed him and con- ,
sented to his going to stay with a sister in ,
San Francisco until he could make ar- i
rangement to take ids wife with him to a ',
place where they could start life anew. '
After being: absent a lev days Mrs. Lan- >
dis went to San Francisco to see her hus- '
band. The discovery she made convinced ,
her that she had been cruelly deserted and ,
that her devotion and self-sacrifice to her
husband while he was in jail had been
returned with ingratitnde. She learned â 
'that- her husband bad gone on a sealing \ !
6chooner to Alaska, ana that before going '
he had signed a contract to work with an
Alaskan company. The heartbroken and :
penniless Mrs. "Landis, who is young,
petite and attractive, came back to Oak
land. She is of rather An independent na
ture, and while not able to work, from
sickness, she was averse to asking for
charity. She made a determined effort to
eke out an existence by canvassing, but !
-.vas too weak, and two days ago she went
to her room in New Broadway and tried
to end her unhappy life. She was found
by her landlady before the poison had
done its work, "and doctors succeeded in
bringing her back to life. She will return
to Stockton this week convinced that she I
has been abandoned by an unwortny hus- i
band.
Moran to Kvopen Thursday.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 6.â The insur
ance companies have reached a settlement !
with J. 1. Moran regarding the damage
done in his clothing-store by the recent
lire. The terms are highly satisfactory to i
Mr. Moran and enable him to open a .
special sale on terms that have- : never been j
duplicated. Tiie flames did not get near I
his store, and the only damage was done |
by smoke, so that some goods nearly as j
good as new and others quite a3 good as
new will be closed out at about one-third
ot their value. Next Thursday morning
. everything will be in readiness for the
opening and customers will get the full ;
benefit of the insurance paid to the propri- '
etor, as he is anxious to get rid of all his
ovock so as to open shortly with an entire
. new lot of Eastern goods. Mr. Moran's
store is located on the corner of Eleventh j
and Broadway in the Ainsworth block. â 
and for several years has been the most
popular clothing emporium in the city,
Tue proprietor was the founder of the old
Greenhood and Moran baseball team, and :
he has never lost the popularity in busi- j
ness that he gained while an ardent pat
ron of the National came.
Swain Will Contest.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 6.â William B. j
Swain, a wealthy farmer of Castro Valley, j
died March 2, leaving an estate worth up
ward of $11,000. He left a will, dated
April 20, 1895, leaving $1000 to Nellie Leoni !
H. Swain, now Nellie Leoni H. Cade, an I
adopted daughter. To his wife he leaves
an unrecorded mortgage which he held on i
her Berkeley property. To Amelia G. ':
Webber forty acres in San Francisco, on -
the San Mateo line. One-third of the
residue of the estate is given the widow
and the other two-thirds to his daughter,!
Amelia G. Webber.
Mrs. Nellie Leoni H. Cade to-day filed a i
contest and opposition to the admission of j
the will to probate. She charges the !
widow and daughter with undue influence !
and fraudulent misrepresentations, by j
which the testator, who was over 82 years j
of age, was induced to make the will
while he was subjected to their control.
Thrown Prom a Cart.
OAKLAND, Cai.., April Mrs. George j
E. Perkins, daughter-in-law of Senator j
George C. Perkins, was thrown from her i
cart while driving Sunday afternoon and j
narrowly escaped serious injury. She was j
driving down the Orange-street grade, and j
when at the intersection with Wadsworth
avenue the horse made a sharp turn and
capsized the cart.
Mrs. Perkins was stunned by the fail,
and it was feared she had received serious
. injuries. To-uay. however, it has been de- j
cided that she only received some severe
bruises and that she would be all right in
a week. Katie Frick, who was in the cart
at the time, escaped injury.
Burjjlarifs at I'leaaantot;. i
PLEASANTON.' <\\i.., April G.-A. F.I
Cordoza'u barber-shop and saloon was en- j
tered by a burglar last night and robbed of
money an i goods valued at $20. ". J. C.
Pundoza, who sleeps in the shop, was
awakened by the noise and saw a man go
out of the window. ,He left an old shoe
' made from a gum boot.

nickels and dimes was secured m 'the
saloon ami a quantity of cigar-, cigarettes |
and iiquors?. Tho' provision-house at thai
brickyard was broken into and about $50
worth of provisions taken. This officers
believe they have a clew that will lead to
the detection or the guilty one.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 7, 1896.
THE DEBATERS
ARE SELECTED
Oakland High School Boys
Are Ready for the
Contest.
CABINET OB MINISTRY?
The Question to Be Argued With
the Lowell High School
Pupils.
FIRST DEBATE OF ITS KIND.
It Will Be Held in the Gymnasium
of the Oakland School
This Month.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 6. f
The alumni, students, parents and
fiiends of members of the Oakland High
School and the Lowell High School of
San Francisco are all eagerly awaiting the
evening ofj Friday, April 24, when three
young men of each school will meet in a
forensic contest in the gymnasium of the
new high school in this city.
This afternoon the second or semi-final
debate was held by the Oakland High
School Debating Society, to determine
which of six young men who had won
over all other members of the society
should appear in the final debate.
These were: Fred G. Dorety, Bertram
Reynolds, Cnarles Quayle. Harry Keeler,
A. J. Cloud and Albert Shoey. The judges
on this occasion were three members of the
faculty, being Professor S. P. Meads, Miss
Elsie B. Lee and Professor C. H. Bieden
bach.
The question debated to-day is the same
as will be contested at the interhigh
school debate, and is worded as follows:
"Resolved, That the substitution of a
responsible Ministry for the President's
Cabinet would be beneficial to the United
States Government."
The judges decided the contest in favor
! of the young men in the order they are
; named above, and they were awarded po
j sitions on the team to contest against the
! Lowell team in that order, the first three,
the fourth to be the substitute in an
i emergency requiring one. The makeup oi
; the Lowell team is: Messrs. J. C. Colman,
! Aaron H. Brown and J. Frank English,
I with Otto H. Hahn as their substitute.
The question to be debated was first
! brought to public attention by Senator
j Pendleton of Ohio in 1863, but it was soon
j shelved. Agnin in 1879 Senator Pendleton
! proposed a bill providing for "a Minister
J of the Cabinet," but again action was de
i layed. Now the measure is pending be
i fore Congress for the third time.
The Lowell High School Debating So
ciety has been in existence a little over a
| yeor and has proven to be the most sue
! cessful of all movements that have been
j taken up at that school to band the stu
; dents in closer relationship to one another.
The Oakland High School Debating So
ciety is composed of members of the three
' highest classes in the school, and it is cus
i tomary for them to give some sort of an
! entertainment at the end of each spring
l term. They issued the challenge that has
j resulted in the present arrangement for
the first interhigh-school debate.
Oakland will have the affirmative and
; San Francisco the negative of the ques
i tion.
The judges who will pass on the merits
01 tue various speakers and decide the con
test are not yet chosen. The societies will
each choose one and these two will choose
the third. It is likely that Attorney Fred
S. Stratton, a graduate of the Oakland
High School, will be chosen by the Oak
land debaiers.
POLISHING "VIGILANT 9"
The Oakland Exempts Purchase
the Old Pioneer Hand
Fire Engine.
They Wi 1 Burnish It and Decorate
It Ready for the Great Fabiola
Floral Fete.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, April 6. \
The old hand fire engine "Vigilant 9"
has been purchased by tfce Exempt Fire
men from the department at Martinez and
will be one of the most interesting features
of t.e Fabiola fete procession. The old
engine has just been brought down and is
now being burnished and put into condi
tion for the parade.
"Vis-'ilant 9" came to San Francisco
from Pawtucket, where it was built, over
forty, years ago. It came around the
Horn, and was a pet among the volunteer
boys who organized the first company in
San Fr.mcisco. The engine is in good
condition, and is a genuine specimen of
the old-time pump. It has been allowed
to get rusty since it went out of cornmis*
sion at Martinez, and some of the old vets
are putting in a few hours each day polish
mlt the metal work.
At the next meeting of the Exempt Fire-
men a proposition will be made that each
member put in a certain time on the old
engine helping to make it presentable for
the great May day festival.
A request will be made to the City Coun
cil for a house in which to keep "Vigi
lant 9." President F. A. Campbell of the
Exempts will see to the decoration of the
historic engine, and, as it is pulled by the
old rope method of the vetÃ, it will "be a
mass of pretty flowers and shining steel.

SYNAGOGUE SITE SOLD
The First Hebrew Congregation
Decides to Adopt a New
Ritual.
Rabbi Friedlander Is Also Elected to
Succeed Himself for, Five
Years.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 6. J
The regular semi-annual meeting of the
First Hebrew Congregation was held yes
terdny afternoon. The meeting was thor
oughly harmonious and there was not the
slightest evidence of any differences such
as have been made public during the past
six months.
Julius Abrahamson presided and con
: gratulated the members on the perfect
' harmony that now prevails. Rev. Dr.
Friedlander, the present rabbi of the
! synagogue, was unanimously re-elected for
a term of five years. On the recommenda
tion of the ritual committee, composed of
I Messrs. Harris, Marcuse, Hirschberg,
I Mossbacher, Kahn, Roseberg and Ahra
harnson, the ritual compiled by Dr. Jas
trow, entitled "Minhag Jastrow," one of
the most eminent American divines, was
unanimously adopted.
By the unanimous vote of those present
it was decided to sell the parcil of land
on which the synagogue stands and pur
chase a site for a new place of worship.
The building committee of the board of
trustees was given full power to act.
President Abraharason has called a special
meeting of the congregation for next
Thursday evening for the purpose of rati
fying the action ot Sunday's meeting.
Closed a Deal.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 6.â The trustees
of the First Hebrew Congregation closed a
deal to-day whereby the synagogue prop
erty will soon be sold.
H. Abrahamson signed an agreement to
purchase the lot for $27,500. This is bind
ing on him, but the trustees reserve the
right to accept a higher bid if any be
offered.
They also have negotiated for the pur
chase of the southeast corner of Twelfth
and Castro streets at a cost of $11,000, and
have signed conditionary papers. This
property is owned by F. H. Morgan.
It is the intention to move the present
structure within the next sixty days to
the new site, and spena several thousand
dollars in remodeling it.
Mr. Morgan has oeen given forty-five
da_v3 in which to move the buildings on
the lot at present, nnd work will be com
menced as soon as papers are signed.
The land which will be sold to Abraham
son cost $5000 eleven years ago, and the
building $18,000. This makes a gain of
522.500, or over $2000 a year. By the ex
change the congregation clears $16,500.
from which it will raise an existing $5500
mortguge, improve the building and put
the balance in the treasury.
Mr. Abrahamson intends to erect a busi
ness block on the old site.
Killed by J* Fall.
Maurice O'Neill, a waiter, 50 years of age,
fell down the stairs iD front of his residence, ax
5 Carlos place, yesterday afternoon, and sus
tained injuries which resulted fatally. A phy
sician was summoned shortly after the acci
dent but lould nothing for the old man, and
he died in about three hours. The body was
taken 10 the Morgue, but an inquest* was
waived by the relatives of ihe uecased.

WITH BURGLARS.

White Mask.
CONFEDERATES RAN OFF.
Three Suspicious Characters Re
leased After a Week's
Imprisonment.
ONE CAUGHT WHILE AT WORK.
He Was Helping Himself to Jewelry
When the Owner Suddenly
Returned Home.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 6. f
Last week three men were locked up
at the city prison and their names placed
on the small book. They were arrested
while selling property on Broadway that
was believed to have been stolen, but as
nothing could be proved against them
they were liberated, though one of them
had just been released from the San Fran
tisco County Jail and Chief Lloyd was con
vinced they were all crooks. It is now
wished that they were still behind the
bars. Although they were recognized by
an officer from San Francisco, there was
nothing on which they could be held.
The men are evidently sneak-thieves
and room burglars and it is said they could
account for many of the petty engine
house thefts that' haye lately been re
ported. Janitor T. F. Faulkner of the
California Hall building has just reported
an attempted burglary by the same trio,
t hat shows them to be very desperate fel
lows.
Mr. Faulkner resides on the second floor
of the building with his family and has
charge ot the whole four-story structure.
Part or all of the halls are rented out for
different purposes, and contain many ar
ticles of value.
On Friday evening Mr. Faulkner was in
his own apartments waiting to put out the
gas in the hall and lock up before retiring.
Just as he was preparing to go upstairs to
the upper floors, the door of his kitchen
was suddenly opened by a great rough
looking fellow, over six feet tall.
"What do you want?" Mr. Faulkner
asked.
The fellow replied by asking, "Does Mr.
Durrant live here?" Then he left as
though he had made a mistake, but Mr.
Faulkner suspected his intentions and pre
pared for hi 3 reappearance. In looking
from Ihe hallway above he saw the man
join two others, and then they whispered
together. As there was no rear entrance
by which any one could gdt out to call
officers, Mr. Faulkner was forced to re
main in t !i3 building.
He stationed himself in a room at the
head of the stairs and did not have long
to wait, for the largest of the trio of men
cautiously and noiselessly crept up the
stairs, while his companions kept watch
on the sidewalk helow. The fellow had a
mask on made from a piece of white cotton
cloth. His shoes were covered with a pair
of thick woolen sockt. drawn over them, so
that his footsteps would be deadened.
When he was just about to go up the stairs
of the next story Mr. Faulkner called him
to halt and pointed a pistol at him. Thus
taken unawares the robber had no chance
j to draw a weapon that was plainly seen
protruding from his coat pocket. Faulk
ner kept him covered with his pistol,
while he kept up a vigorous blowing of a
police whistle. No response came, but when
the tirst shrill whistle was given, the con
federates in waiting ran like deer. As no
police aid came, and not daring to leave
his wife alone, the janitor was compelled
to allow the burglar to escape. Mr. Faulk
ner says the fellow was a "dangerous
looking big strapping fellow T , that any one
might fear to meet unless wÂ«ll armed."
This evening another of the trio was
arrested by Officer Green. He was found
by a roomer named Franklin in the Annex
on Telegraph avenue, and after an excit
ing chase was captured. He gave the
name of A. F. Williams at the City Hall,
and is about 30 years old. When searched
some jewelry belonging to Franklin was
found on him, and also a lot of keys. His
companions will now probably leave town.
Dr. McLean's Probable Successor.
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 6.â Rev. L. H.
Hallock, D.D., of Tacoma, Wash., is be
lieved by many to be the new pastor of
the First Congregational Church of this
city. The fact that he resigned his pas
torate a week ago Sunday, without any
previous intimation of such action, and the
further fact that Key. J. K. McLean, the
former pastor of this church, who has been
actively interested securing his own suc
cessor, has been in Portland recently is
cited as proof of this belief.
The statement was made to-day that at
the annual meeting of the church to be
held Wednesday evening the name of the
new pastor would be made public. It ex
cited the greatest interest. Those who
know are guarding tneir secret with the
utmost care to keep it from being made
public before that meeting. They admit,
| however, that the man has served an EaÂ«.t
--j crn church continuously for ten years, and
is to be here to occupy the pulpit Sunday
next and also the following Sunday, and
will then return to hia present home and
put his affairs into condition to move here
to reside.
Rev. Mr. Hallock came from Maine,
where he was in one church for ten years,
and besides that he has been a guest at
Mills College, a few miles east of Oakland,
for Several weeks up to two weeks ago,
when he returned iiome. While at the
college it is now known that he had con
ferences with members of the pulpit com
mittee.
The City Council.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 6. âThe City
Council elected Frank Mott, Councilman i
j from the First Ward, to be president for
the coming year at its meeting to-night.
The only significance that this change of
president possesses is that he reappoints
the standing committees. President Mott
wili announce his choice next Monday
night. The report upon Mayor Davie'"s
charges against the incompetency o! the
Street Superintendent was presented by
Mr. Mott, who had been appointed a com
mittee of one to investigate. The report
was sarcastic in the extreme and stated
I briefly that th.c Mayor should be invited to
do his duty and proceed acainst Superin
tendent Miller as a derelict official. No
explanation of the Mayor's charges was
made, as it was stated that the Mayor had
the only remedy in his own hands.
McChemey Matter Settled.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 6.â The Board
of Education met to-night and elected
Director Clement to oe president for the
coming year. President Clement will
name his standing committees at the next

DISGUSTED WITH YALE
Berkeley Athletes Puzzled Over
a Letter Received From
Captain Sheldon.
Manager Friend Says They Are Afraid
to Meet the Californians â Another
School Election.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 6.â Captain
Merwin and Manager Friend of the East
ern track athletic team received a letter
from Captain Sheldon of thp Yale athletic I
team to-day, over the contents of which
they are much puzzled.
The letter is in response to one from
Manager Friend in which he proposed
terms for Â£a triple contest between Yale,
Princeton and the California team. They
cannot tell from the Yale communication,
they say, whether Yale declines to meet
the CaliforniaDs from indifference, because
they cannot with propriety arrange a
meet, or whether they will not do so from
fear that they will be beaten. In
speaking of the matter to-day, Cap
tain Merwin said: "I am very much
surprised and disgusted at the way Yale j
has acted. They gave us to understandjin
a recent telegram that they would be will
ine to meet n3 in the triple games, and we
were counting on having a contest with
them. We telegraphed them some time
ago asking if they were willing to enter
the triple meet or contest against us
singly, to which they responded that they
could not arrange to do so at such short
notice. In rep y to the sume telegram
sent to Princeton the reply came that they
were willing to have a meet in which Cali
fornia, Yale and their own college were
represented, if it was possible to arrange
such a contest.
Following is the letter which puzzles the
Berkeley athletes:
New Haven, March 29. 1896.
L. R. Merwin, Captain Track Team, University
of California â Dear t-lR: Your letter of March
19 received. I telegraphed you yesterday that
a triangular meet between the University of
California, Princeton and Yale wonld be Im
possible. All the arrangements for dual games
between Princeton aud Yale have been com
pleted and it does not seem wise to change the
meet to a triangular contest. Should you see
fit to come east of Chicago we might arrange a
set of sanies with you. fle should hardly like \
to limit the number of competitors to less than
three in each event (possibly two) as we wish
as many of our men to have the practice as is
possible. In regard to the financial outlook I
think it would hardly pay you to come from
New York to New Haven for games, as I am
afraid the contest would not attract much
of a crowd here in New Haven,
where the games must necessarily
be held, if held at all. New Haven is a poor
city for athletic games, especially track ath
letics. I hardly understand Princeton's action
in regard to your coming in as a third party to
our games, as I thought it was decided that we
should have dual games. 1 think you must
have misconstrued my tirst telegram, as your
letter shows. Hoping that the matter is all
straight now, I remain, yours very sincerely,
Lewis P. Sheldon,
Captain Yale Athletic Team,
212 Durfee Hnll.
"Now, Princeton was willing," said Cap
tain Merwin, "that we should come into
the game and make the dual meet between
their team and Yale a triple one. Prince
ton had no objections whatsoever to allow
ing us to enter men at this meet, and they
had just as much to say about the matter
as Yale. It appears to us very much as
though Yale was trying to crawl out. and
do it as gracefully as possible. Another
point in the letter is that should a dual
meet between our men and Yale be ar
ranged they would consent to no terms
but those wuich included three or perhaps
two men in each event. They give as
their reason that they wish to give
them practice. They know full well
that we cannot take even two men tor
each event across the continent because of
the enormous expense, and to say that
they will wish tc give their men praciice
is all nonsense. A contest such as it would
be is no place for practicing. Then again,
to say that it would probably not pay us
to go down to New Haven from New York
to meet them on account of the lack of!
interest in track athletics there is simply i
ridiculous. The whole letter appears to
me as nothing more than a big excuse to
avoid meeting us in a fair and square con
test. I understand that their team ia not !
as good this year as last, ana perhaps they
have good reasons for not wanting to con
test with our men."
Manager Friend is of the same opinion
as Captain Merwin with regard to the
position Yale has taken, and with relation
to the letter said this afternoon : "I think '
it is nothing more or less than a clear case !
of squeal" on their part.
The prospects of sending another team j
across the continent again this summer I
has reawakened the athletic interest again
at the university, so that now there are
more men in training on the track and
field than ever before in the history of the
institution.
At almost any time of day a dozen or
more can ba seen practicing the different
events. Toward evening a veritable crowd
of them take possession of the training
grounds. The great majority of them are !
new men, some of whom have hopes of I
making the team. Others, who have no
prospect of getting a place o'i the team, j
are training for futux-e possible trips, and
to encourage those who will be selected to
represent the university in the East.
The central point of interest now among
all the athletes at Berkeley besides the
Eastern scheme i 9 the championship held
day which will be held at Central Park on
May 2, the proceeds of which are to be
turned over to the team which will cross
the continent. In this meet all the ath
letic clubs of the State will be represented.
Manager Friend states that the dates
made with the colleges in the extreme
East are as follows: Harvard, May 23;
Mott-Haven names, May 30; Pennsyl
vania, soon alter Mott-Haven, and the
Western intercollegiate at Chicago on
June 6.

Arrested for -Selling Liquor.
BERKLEY, Cal., April 6.â Joseph
Doran, keeper of ihe California Hotel, was
arrested this afternoon for maintaining a
glace of business where liquor is sold.
The complaint was entered by Depnty
Marshal Rawson and the warrant served
by Deputy Marshal Kerns. Marshal Lloyd
states that he has positive proof against
the accused. The arrest of l)oran will re
open the fight against the liquor men.
The arrest of Doran shows that the Town
Marshal is still after the "speak easies,"
and it is the general opinion that they will
be more cautious.
Another Election.

ANSON PHELPS STOKES
The Millionaire Author and So
ciety Leader of New York
Arrives Here.
Came by Stage From Atchison in
Eighteen Daysâ His Views of
the Money Situation.
Anson Pbelps Stokes, the millionaire
banker of New York, who^e magnificent
residence on Madison avenue adjoins that
of William O. Havemeyer, and who is
the author of several books, is at the
Palace.
He is one of the originators of the Re
form Club, and is at the head of the lead
ing social clubs and of the geographical
and scientific societies. He is also con
spicuous in New York social circles, hav
ing for many years been a member of the
Four Hundred. He has for several years
spent much time abroad, and is well
posted on political and financial subjects.
His most prominent boot perhaps ia
"Joint Metallism," which has appeared in
four editions. He is a Democrat, a large
contributor to the State and National cam
paign funds and close to the leaders of
his party.
Mr. Stokes is here to investigate a mine
as well as to enjoy himself. It is a tin
mine in Southern California, and he has
been developing it for some time. The
gentleman's family is along and is now at
Del Monte.
Mr. Stokes made his first visit to Cali
fornia thirty-three years ago. when, as a
representative of his father, he accom
panied a number of British bankers here.
They took a special stage at Atchison,
Kan., and made the entire trip to San
Francisco in eighteen days. At that time
Los Angeles had but 5000 people and
Southern California was Mexicanized.
San Francisco, compared to what it is
now, was unpretentious. Mr. Stokes says
he can scarcely realize the changes.
On the subject of the present condition
of the country he said:
"I believe that most of the present de
pression in trade, agriculture and other
industries is traceable to ignorance of the
history and science of money, and to at
tempts to try unscientific experiments. I
oppose both monometallism and bimetal
lism at any fixed empirical ratio. I would
have the mints open to both the precious
metals at their market values when they
are presented together in quantities of
equal value, and that joint certificates,
payable half in gold and half in silver, be
issued by the treasury, to be legal tender
for ail debts contracted after a fixed future
date.
"I should like to see both gold and sil
ver used as the constitution intended they
should be, as the metallic basis of the cur
rency, and on substantial equal terms at
their relative market values.
"The constitution provides that for the
use of pold and silver as a legal tender, and
at rates fixed by Congress. That it is to
say that it is the duty of Congress to fix
this ratio fro;n time to time to correspond
with the market ratio, as near as may be.
"I am opposed to gold monometallism,
| and I am equally opposed to an arDitrary
I ratio at 16 to 1.
Mr. Stokes came here on his special car.
He sent it back on his arrival here, so that
bis family could have it at their disposal.
â¢ â â¦ â â¢
A foreigner has invented a telephone
gear that can be carried with ease on a
soldier's back in lieu of the ordinary knap
sack. It combines the indispensable qual
ities of simplicity, lightness, facility and
rapidity of installation.

POSTMASTER BELL
TALKS OF GHOSTS
the Carson City Gentleman
Recites the Loss of
His Coin.
WORKING THE SCHEME.
The Nevada Citizen Had Implicit
Faith in His Spirit Friend
Rodman.
LETTERS OFFERED IN EVIDENCE
Professor Van de Vere Seemed to
Enjoy Ihe Recital of His Wonder
ful Powers.
George H. Bell, ex- Postmaster of Carson
City, toid in Judge Low's court yesterday
how Professor Eugene and Professor Van
de Vere, through the connivance of sun
dry "spirit?," succeeded in obtaining from
him something like $1100.
It was an intensely dramatic recital, in
which ghosts and creations of the other
world formed an important part. Hia
Honor, Judge Low. felt himself getting
under the "spell" and at 5 o'clock found it
MOMBUy to postpone further hearing of
the case until Wednesday.
When the session ended spooks of the
Van de Vere-Eugene creation were at a
discount. Bell was irtroduced to at least
three wraiths from the other world as tne
result of his sixty days' intercourse with
the two noted clairvoyants, but just how
many more De Vere and Eugene may have
had up their sleeves will not be known
until the trial is over.
The spirit of Rodman, the Postmaster's
dead friend, acting in conjunction with
the Kentucky article traveling under the
name of Rye, seems to have been the
cause of the Carson City jrentleman's
troubles. The combination put all sorts
of peculiar ideas into Bell's head, and
when he reached San Francisco Van de
Vere had an easy time of it. Eugene was,
of course, cognizant of all these little
menial frailties, including the spirit busi
ness, and it was therefore an easy matter
for him to play on the credulity of the
new-made spiritualistic convert.
When Bell had told the court all about
the spirits he dropped back to earth in a
very commonplace way. True, a spirit
caused this descent, but such an every
day affair as a hen roost did not seem to
jibe well with a ehost in good stand
ing. Nevertheless Bell told how
some unseen influence had caused his
friend Jaqua. the postal clerk, to
design a chicken-coop for him, though just
what he was to do with it was not quite
clear. In any event he took the chicken
coop, and for a time treasured it, but later
consigned it to the liames. This apparent
defiance of the "unseen" was due to the
wishes of his spirit friend Rodman.
The case against Van de Vere was first
called. The defendant proved to be a tall,
slimlv built young man of perhaps 30,
with red cheeks and blonde whiskers.
During Bell's recital of how he lost the
$1100, Van de Vere smiled and blushed,
and at times laughed outright. He evi
dently did not take any great amount of
stock in the spirits he had conjured up for
the postmaster's benefit. Bell began his
statement by telling of the numerous
visits lie had paid the clairvoyants.
"February l? 3." he said, "I called on
Van de Vere and he told me that some
thing of importance was to happen. The
next day I called again and he said tbat
an evil spirit was about me and it would
require $100 to remove it. I drew $125
from the Hibernia Bank, paying Van de
Vere the sum demanded.
"He told me that he would begin work
right away. I saw him the next day and
he informed me that it would require ad
ditional influence to remove this evil
spirit. He suggested Professor Eugene
and we went to soe him. The latter told
me that he must have $200 for his part of
the wort, all of which I paid.
â¢'Sunday, March 1, I again called on
Van de Vere. He then told im- that about
the year 1700 one James Beli of Scotland
died, leaving an estate worth Â£13,000,000,
of which I was the lawful heir. He said I
must be very quiet and secret about it."
The witness then related how Van de
Vere had told him that Cnoate & Co. of
New York would manage his interests on
this side, while Sir Charles Russell would
perform a similar duty in Scotland. It
was necessary, however, to have some one
investigate the titles, and Van de Vere
suggested one Charles A. Hodson of Chi-
cago. This gentleman would cross the
briny deep for the paltry sum of $2000 cash
down.
Bell did not have this amount. In fact
his American possessions at that time,
outside of a lame mare, amounted in
cash to $soo. He parted with this sum,
Eugene loaning him $300 and Van de
Vere putting up the balance. The wit
ness admitted that he was compelled to
borrow money in order to get back home.
Bell said he believed in Van de Vere, Eu
gene and the spirits, and for that reason
it did not occur to him to ask for a receipt
for his coin. He returned to Carson City
a trusting, faithful spiritualist, and from
that time on Van de Vere never gave him
cause to doubt. In fact the clairvoyant

wrote him several letters, the fir9t reading
as follows :
San Francisco, March 20, 1 896.
T)tar Brother: I will begin working on the
i matter immediately. Have received no com-
I munications of importance. The attorney was
â¢ to leave on the 18th for London. He will write
; me as soon as he arrives, which will be in eifcht
I or ten days. Everytning is all right, so Rod
! says. Kindly tell me in your next letter the
nature in detail of the charges that hare been
preferred by R. C. Riggs.
We are bound to succeed, brother. Nothing
can stop us. Yours, fraternally.
Charles Van de Yere.
A few days after the clairvoyant told the
Postmaster that Sir Charles Russell â¢would
probably want to see him in the fall. The
letter containing this pleasing news reads:
San Francisco, Oai... March 23, 189G
Mr. George Sell, Carson City, Xev. â Dear
Brother: Have received your last two letters.
Am glad your health is good and that the
rheumatism has left you. Yes, burn the plans
of the chicken-coops.
I think Sir Charles will want to see you, but
probably not before fall. I don't want you to
receive any messages from Rod, except through
me. He might give Jaqua a message, but
nothing of importance. Besides, a partially
developed medium seldom interprets a mes
sage right, and much error might arise in this
manner. Be careful to keep this to yourself,
as it might interfere with your getting the
$10,000 if Jaqua thought you doubted his
mediumistic powers.
We will make that fellow Riggs sick before
we pet through with him. He is doing the
talking now, but later on when he finds that
you are one of the richest men in the world he
will take his hat off to you. I will nse my
strongest influence on him. and we are bound
to triumph. Right always does.
Rod says to be temperate and careful for a
roupleof months at least, after which your
greatest troubles will be past. He also says
that I e re are many good things about the
M< mj. ?. Lite, but not to bother with it at
MarÂ« 'it wn E'nti>ne and he tells me that

Chari.es Van de Verb.
Six days later Van de Vere told his Car
son City friend that the Chicago attorney
had reached England. He knew because
"Rod," the spirit, had told him. The
letter read as follows:
Ban Francisco, March 29, 1896.
George H. hell, A'ng.â Dear Brother: The
attorney is in England. Have not heard from
him yet, as it takes two weeks for a reply.
But Rod told me so yesterday that he was
there. He made no communications of any
importance except relating to tbe estate. Am
anxiously awaiting a letter from the attorney,
but I know already of his beginning to collect
evidence. Hoping to hear from you often, I
am, fraternally yours,
Charles Van de Vere.
The witness then told how he had come
to the City on Friday of last week and,
without any formality, demanded of Vau
de Vere the coin paid him.
On cross-examination Bel said he met
Jaqua. the postal clerk, twelve years ago.
It was this gentleman who had initiated
him into the mysteries of spiritu
alism. It was through Jaqua that
he first learned of chicken - coops
and such thing. Jagua had simply held
the pencil, and the missive being from the
other world had done the rest. He said
that on the strength of these unearned
millions he had made several subscriptions
to churches which he now saw no oppor
tunity to meet.
Bell also said that he had written a letter
to Van de Vere on March 20, in which he
had made use of this expression : "it has
kind of got into my mind that Sir Charles
Russeli may want me in Scotland this
year."
The examination will be continued to
morrow morning.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRTL 7, 1896.
WHAT IS THE CABBALA?
Professor Naphtaly Herz Imber
Comes to Town to
Explain.
Its Prophets Have Universal Knowl
edge and Powers Attributed
to the Mahatmas.
Professor Naphtaly Herz Imber. who j
claims to be the only apostle, or at least ;
the chief apostle of the "Cabbala," is in j
the City for the purpose of explaining
What the Cabbalajis.
The professor is a Hebrew, and rather a
striking figure to look at, wearing his I
black hair a la Paderewski. He is some- ;
what undersized, swarthy of face, with !
black, mellow eyes. Claiming the power I
of the Mahatmas, he says he works for his '
living as hard as anybody, and refuses to
exert his powers for the making of money, i
"I am an exponent of the Cabbala," he I
says, "which stands for happiness and
self-satisfaction. There are those who have j
more money than I have; there are those j
who have renown and official honors that I
I have not, but I have that which none of
hese things can buy â the happiness of a i
consciousness of the truth.
"I might practice medicine, or at least
the art of healing the sick, and I have been
urged to do so for the immense fortune
that they tell me there is in it for me if I
will, but I will not. I might work the
tricks of the spiritualists and mediums,
but it is all claptrap, and I would have
none of it.
"No, my mission in life is to do good
through the dissemination of the knowl
edge of the truth. lam not a theosophist.
Professor Napthaley Henry Imbcr, Apostle of "the Cabbala," Possessed of Uni
versal Knowledge Through Its Instrumentality.
I am opposed to theosophy, as it is a mis
conception of the truth. Theosophy
quotes from the Cabbala, the Cabbala
quotes from nothingâ it is the fountain
head. Mine. Blavatsky was misled â will
fully or otherwise, I do not know â but she
failed in her effort to secure the truth.
"What is the Cabbala, and how do its
teachings differ from those of tbeosophy?
Well, in a word the Cabbala is truth.
I'ilate asked Christ what was truth. He
did not answer. But truth is that which
no science, no philosophy, can controvert.
The preacher, the Driest, the raboi, the
tneo3ophi?tâ all of them accept the Cab
bala when they know it. Its teachings are
found in no Dooks. The dying Cabbalist â
the Cabbalist who believes his work to be
doneâ imparts it to some other known to
him to be ready to receive it.
Professor Imber professes by the am of
the Cabbala, the trnth within him, to be
possessed of universal knowledge â that is
to say, to know all things upon demand.
For instance, he says he could go to any
strange land and talk and write the lan
guage of the people without any previous
knowledge of it. He says he wrote an ex
pose of the Koch lymph at the time when
medical men believed in it most. H6
wrote for the New York Medical Record
the history of the lymph, its composition
and a statement of the fact that it had
been used 2000 years before, that it had
been a failure then and would be a failure
now. He said that article checked the
enthusiasm for the lymph and ultimately
killed it. The article was copied in the
medioal journals of the entire world.
Dr. Pchrader of the Medical Record
asked him why he did not practice medi
cine. His answer was that he did not
hare a diploma and was not a doctor.
In like manner, with no knowledge of
music, he yet wrote for musical journals
on the science of music and about ancient
annotation.
He will lecture to-night at the Temple
Emanu-El on "What is the Cabbala?"
PITTSBURG JACK
SURE ENOUGH
Gillis and Kline Swear That
He Was the Dead
Burglar.
POLICE THEORIES FAIL.
Captain Lees Heard Some Inter
esting News in Court
Yesterday Morning.
THE "CALL'S" STORY PROVED.
A Gang of Criminals Brought to Light
by Detective Kline's Dis
closures.
Captain Lees met with signal failure yes
terday morning when he tried to prove
that the burglar killed by Butler Miller
was not Pittsburg Jack. The Call first
published the story, and it was vigorously
denied by the head of the detective
bureau, who had nothing to go on except
a theory.
In order to prove that the article in The
Call was a misstatement, be had Harry
Kline and Charles Giilis summoned before
Police Judge Low yesterday morning to
swear to what they knew about the dead
burglar.
Gillis declared that he met Pittsburg
Jack in Illinois eight years ago, and was
with Jack when he had his arm tattooed.
He knew Jack in Missouri, where he was
known as Clark and Dougherty. After
hearing of the burglary Gillis went to the
Morgue and identified the dead man as
Pittsburg Jack. His identification was
positive, and there was not the slightest
possibility of a mistake.
Captain Lees asked Gillis where he got
the information as to the details of the
burglary, and Gillis replied that William
H. Stewart, alias "Muddy Bill," had told
him that on the night of the burglary
Hayes and Reilly were not at their usual
haunt at 37 Clay street. He also got some
information from Frank Marion, alias
"The Kid."
Gillis said also that a man named Lob
Wilson had told him that Hayes was a
stoolpigeon, and had it not been for
Reilly, Hayes would not have been sus
pected. Gillis visited Reilly last Tuesday
and had a long conversation with him, in
which Reiily said he was anxious to eet
out of town, and that there was an oppor
tunity of burglarizing Young's drugstore
on the corner of Howard and Langdon
streets, but that he would not need to do
it if he could get some money from his
mother. In pursuance of this conversa
tion, Kiley made an appointment to meet
Gillis that evening at Howard and Sev
enth streets, but the appointment was not
kept.
Gillis added that he was acquainted with
Patsy Lynch, Reilly's chum, and that
Lynch was not a saint.
After this statement, so damaging to
the theory of the detectives, Captain Lees
asked Kline and Gillis whether they did
not wish to swear to complaints charging
Reiily and Hayes with burglary. They
replied that as they were neither paid de
tectives nor public prosecutors they did
not wish to swear to complaints against
any one.
Reilly was then taken into Captain Lees
office, where he made the following state
ment:
Statement of E. J. S. Reilly, alias "Handsome
Reilly," maae to Captain I. W. Lees, April G, in
the Dresence of Detectives Gibson and Wren:
â¢'Toronto Slim" came up to my house last
Tuesday afternoon. My mother went to the
door, and he asked for Frank Reilly. I went
down to the door, and when I first saw him I
did not know him until he grinned, and then
I recognized him, and we went out on the front
porch and talked for about an hour of old
times.
I met Slim in Oakland about five years ago.
He has the name of being a safeeracker and an
all around thug and has done time in the East
ern penitentiaries. He tried to kill a couple of
men on his way to Los Angeles one time, so I
am told. After talking on the porch he in
vited me over to the saloon to have a drink
and threw down a half-dollar and bought two
rounds of beer. He wanted to know if I could
put him on to some place where he could crack
a safe or hold some one up. I told him I had
changed and did not do that kind of work and
1 made an engagement to meet him the follow
ing Saturday night at7:3o, but did not. He said
him and his partner, "Reckless Jim," wanted
to know of some safe to crack or nome one to
hold up. I never saw him again until I met
him in court this morning
He never mentioned a word to me about
Young's drugstore, or me to him. It is just a
few doors from me, and it is not likely I would
hold up a place a few doors from where I live.
This is all the conversation I had with Slim in
regard to this matter. E. J. S. Reilly.
Witnesses to signature.
Subscribed and sworn to before me this 6th
day of April, A. D. 1896.
Harry Piper, Deputy County Clerk.
Architect Heilly, however, does not re
quire any credentiais of good character
from the police. His own affidavit, pub
lished here, describes the character of an
architect that he is. He hobnobs and
drinks with a man whom he knows to be a
burglar, and who, according to Architect
Reilly's affidavit, has called on him for the
purpose not of drawing plans for a Nob Hill
residence, but for the purpose of assisting
him in the burglary of a drugstore. Burg
lars are not in the habit of asking respect
able architects to join them in their mid
night raids, but either Gillis or Reilly
must have been an exception to the gen
eral rule.
What does Architect Reilly say to this
infamous proposition? He accepts the
burglar's beer and mildly but virtuously
replies. Here is his answer in his own
affidavit:
He wanted to know if I could put him on to
some place where he could crack a safe or hold
some one up. I told him i had changed and
did not do that kind of work, and I made an
engagement to meet him the following Satur
day night at 7:30, but did not.
Another respectable witness is William
H. Stewart, poetically aliased "Muddy
Bill."
Bill hastens to remove any unfavorable
impression whicn might be created on
account of his nickname by remarking, "I
once fell in the mud and that is why
they call me 'Muddy Bill.' "
Muddy says that ho met Toronto Slim
a week ago last Sunday night in a saloon
where two glasses of beer are sold for 5
cents. Slim was with Shorty Solomon.
Muddy introduced himself to Slim with
the remark that he ("Muddy") had been
on the road (a tramp) for live years. He
denies having told Toronto Slim that
Reilly and Hayes were not around the
saloon on the night of the Franklin bur
glary.
Harry T. Marion, aliaÃ "the Kid," is
another respectable witness for the police.
He tells that Slim was a safe-cracker, and
that he (the Kid) directed Slim to Hand
some Keilly'a house. The respectable
Kid proceeds :
Plim also told me that he was a "Peter man"
(safe-cracker), and that he had been in the pen
itentiary one-half his life. He asked me if I
knew what kind of a fellow "Handsome
Reilly" was. I told him that he was a good
fellow, that he was pretty good with his fists,
and I told him I thought he had a lot of grit.
He asked me if I knew whether Reilly was a
"Peter man" or not. I told him I did not. I
told him I would introduce him to Reilly.
Slim represented to me that Solomon was a
sure-thing man and a short-card gambler.
This exhausts the Ji?t of the witnesses
for the police. It looks as though the
theory that Butler Miller killed the burg
lar after havine enticed him into the
house would not tit.
It has been suggested as an experiment
worth trying "to pinch" one of the gang
and see whether he would not "squeal."
Criminals have been known to do that
kind of thing occasionally.
One fact has been officially determined
in the matter, and that is that The Call's
story was correct and that the man in the
Morgue was Pittsburg Jack.
Gillis stated afterward that the star on
the dead burglar's right arm was tatooed
in his presence in Carlynville, 111., in 1889.
Pittsburg Jack left Jefferson City, Mo., in
1885. and went to Illinois, whence he
drifted out West.

Must Go.
The Ashbury Heights and Stanyan Street
Improvement Club held an important
meeting at the residence of F. W. M.
Lange last evening. The business was
redhot from start to finish, showing
that the peopie of that locality
are for improvement in earnest.
A committee was appointed to
wait upon the Park Commissioners to
obtain some information regarding the
depot of the railway line running to the
beach. The structure in question is situ
ated on Stanyan street, near the Haight
street entrance to the park. It is an un
signtly pile occupying a portion of the
park and the high picket fence that sur
rounds the structure occupies the sidewalk
of the street.
The Park and Ocean road pays the nom
inal sum of $100 per year for the franchise
through Golden Gate Park without the
building, which the company has pre
empted without tne slightest authority.
The property has grown to be extremely
valuable and the railroad eets a number of
blocks of it rent free.
"We wish to know," said George T.
Gaden, a prominent member of the club,
last evening, "why a portion of the City's
park should be donated to the Market
street Railway Company. We also want
to know why that corporation should
annex a part of the City's side
walk for its private purpose and
put a fence around it. Generally
when people occupy City property, they
pay rent, but it seems that Mr. Vining
sometimes overlooks that little matter.
We instructed the committee to talk
to that gentleman on the subject also."
Another committee was selected to wait
upon the railway officials regarding the 3
cent fare proposition. The Ashbury
Heights Club is determined to strike now
at the nickel fare and keep it ur> until
mere is a streetcar fare reduction all
over the City. They will also re
quest the Market-street Company to run
its cars in that locality all day, instead of
a few hours durinethe morning and even
ing. There is a suit pending aeainst the
company calling for the forfeiture of the
franchise on Carl and other streets in that
vicinity, and the people in that neighbor
hood are determined that the case shall
be rushed to a conclusion.

Ladies' Institute No. 3 will present to the

trouble to achieve a successful result.
