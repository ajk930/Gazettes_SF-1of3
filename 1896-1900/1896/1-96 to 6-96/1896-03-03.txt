WASHINGTON, D. C, March. 2.â
After a long conference with the President
this morning Secretary Olney gave out for
publication the following cablegram from
. ayJor, United States Minister at Madrid,
under date of March 1 :
"The Minister of State has just called to
express his deep regret that the mob had
insulted the Barcelona consulate, breaking
windows, and offered complete reparation.
He informed me that the Government
on its own motion has taken every precau
tion to guard the legation and my resi
dence. I have asked no protection."
Prior to the receipt of this dispatch mes
sages reporting the assault on the Barce
lona consulate had been received ' from
both Minister Taylor and Herbert Bowen,
Consul at Barcelona.
Senor Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish Min
ister, had also been informed of the news. j
He. waived ceremony and called on the
Secretary at his residence yesterday to ex
press in advance of instructions the regret j
of his Government over the occurrence.
These indications of a desire on the
part of the Spanish Government to
make every amend for the insult to the
consulate -were carefully considered by
the President and Secretary Olney at the
conference this morning. They were con
vinced that no affront had been given for
which the Government was responsible.
It is understood that Secretary Olney has j
sent a dispatch to Minister Taylor instruct- I
ing him to make known to the Spanish j
suihorides the appreciation of this Gov- j
ernment of their prompt disavowal of the \
insult. The incident-is believed in official
circles to be practically ended with Spain's
denial of any responsibility for the attack,
and her evident desire to make all amends
satisfactory to the United States.

CONCURRED IS BY THE HOUSE. I
Adoption of the Resolutions Recognizing
Cuban Belligerency.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March The
House to-day, after two hours' spirited de
bate under the limitations of a suspension
of the rules, by a vote of 263 to 17, agreed
to (in lieu of the resolutions adopted Fri
day by the Senate) the concurrent resolu
tions reported last week by its Committee
on Foreign Affairs, declaring that, in the
opinion of Congress, a state of public
war exists in Cuba, the parties to
which are entitled to belligerent
rights, and between which the United
States should observe a strict neutrality.
They further declare that Congress be
lieves the only permanent solution of the
contest is in the establishment of a gov
ernment by the people of Cuba, and that it
-is the sense of Congress that the Govern
ment of the United States should use its
good offices and influences to that end ; and
that the United States should be prepared
to protect the legitimate interests of its
citizens in Cuba' by intervention if neces
sary. The last of the series of resolutions
reported by the committee pledging the
' support of Congress to the President in
carrying out the foregoing was stricken
out, it being thought unnecessary, being
covered in the others.
â¢ - Hitt (R.) of Illinois, chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, called up the
Senate Cuban resolutions and moved to
â  suspend the rules and pass the resolutions
reported by the House Foreign Affairs
Committee in lieu of the Senate resolu
â  tions. The resolutions are as follows:
Resolved, By the House \of Representatives
(the Senate concurring)' that in the opinion of
"Congress a state of public war exists in Cuba,
the parties to which are entitled to belligerent
-rights, and the United States should observe a
strict neutrality between the belligerents.
â ' 'Resolved, That Congress deplores the destruc
tion of "life and property caused by the war
now waging in that island, and believing that
the only permanent solution of the contest
equally in the interest of Spain, the people of
Cuba and other nations would be in the estab
lishment of a government by the choice of the
people of Cuba, it is the sense of Congress that
the Government of the United States should
use its good offices and friendly influence to
that end.
Resolved, That the United States has not in
tervened in struggles between any. European
Governments and their colonies on ' this ; con
tinent, but from the very close relations
between, the people of the United States and
the people of Cuba, in consequence of its
proximity and the extent of the commerce
between the two . peoples, the present war Is
en-tailing such losses upon , the j people of the
United States that Congress is of the opinion
"that the Government of the United States
should be prepared to protect the legitimate
interests of our citizens by Intervention, if
necessary.
Boutelle (R.) of Maine demanded a sec
-cond to the motion, and it was ordered by
a vote of 175 to 19. \ ' â * â  v
At the request of Hitt thirty-five min
utes on each side was allowed for debate. â 
The debate was opened by Hitt. The
resolutions, he said, had been considered
with great care by the committee in many <
meetings, passing throueh several months,
and after consultation with many eminent
jurists. It was the belief of the committee
that in the interest of peace, in the inter
est of the United States and in the interest
of those who were struggling in Cuba and J i
with whom the committee sympathized, j <
the resolutions presented were a practical, -
The San Francisco Call.
conservative and effective mode of opera
tion.
Hitt recalled the fact that the belliger
-1 ency of the Southern Confederacy had
i been recognized by Spain a month before
the first battle of the warâ the battle of
| Bull Run. The Government of the United
j States should now. through the State De
partment, ask that the people of Cuba
l should have a government of their own
! choice. Wherever American interests
I were imperilled, Hitt declared in conclu
sion, marines were landed to protect thÃm.
The great arm of the "republic, he ex
claimed, ought to be ready always to fol
i low its people and protect their interests,
their property and their rights anywhere
in the world. [Applause on the floor and
in the galleries.]
McCreary (D.)of Kentucky, a member
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, de
clared himself emphatically, in favor of
the pending resolutions. He spoke of the
: brutal outrages and barbarous atrocities
; of the Spaniards in Cuba, and declared the
time had come when Congress should do
something. The time had come when the
war in Cuba should be stopped. Cuba had
an organized government, a legislature,
an organized army, and her people had
successfully met 100,000 Spanish soldiers.
In his opinion the resolutions reported
from the Committee on Foreign Affairs
were proper and should be adopted. He
â  wanted to see Cuba free, and he- believed
that, in God's own time." Cuba would be a
free and independent republic. â¢ [Ap
plause.] â 
Adams (R.) of Pennsylvania advocted
the resolutions and spoke of the Liberty
' Bell of Independence Hall, Philadelphia,
1 echoing among the hills of the Queen of
! the Antilles. His own opinion was that the
actual recognition â¢of a new government
j was an executive function.
Sulzer (D.) of New York argued that the
j Cuban patriots were entitled by every
j principle of international law to belliger
; ent rignts. They had a standing army in
| the field of over 40.000 men. They had
i made their declaration of independence
j similar to the American declaration, and
more justifiable. They had adopted a con
j stitution, republican in form. They had
i elected a President and Vice-President and
a constitutional Assembly; and they had j
' a Ministry which was competent to-day to j
| treat or negotiate with any power on the
' face of the globe. If he had his way he J
: would
â¢ But before having a chance to say what
be would do if he had his way, Sulzer was
\ cut off in the middle of the sentence by
the fall of the Speaker's gavel and heard
| a shout of laughter from all sides of the
; House and from the galleries.
The debate on the opposite side of the
' question was opened by Turner (D.) of
j Georgia, who commented on the fact that
j the Committee on Foreign Affairs had not
j seen fit to report the facts on which its
! recommendations rest. There were no
I facts presented,- end '-a -''pamphlet from thY
State Department contained only a dreary
record of mutual outrage, incendiarism
and assassination. "And yet," 'said' he,
."we are asked sto declare that a state of
public war exists on the island of Cuba."
As to the recognition of the Southern
Confederacy by Spain, Turner recalled the
fact that the people of the Confederacy
held at the time a region of country ex
tending from the mouth of the Potomac to
the Rio Grande, and that it had an army
against which the combined legions of
Caesar and the phalanxes of â¢ Alexander
would have been utterly unavailing. [Ap
plause.]
"What information," Turner . asked,
"have we from the gentlemen represent
ing these resolutions on a single one of
these important and material questions?
Who is the President of this so-called re
public? I understand he is a citizen of
the United States, and I understand that
he is now in the United States â¢ in
stead of taking his fate along
with the patriots fighting for
freedom. Where ;is the capital of that
country? How many men have the in
surgents in their army? Who knows?
What great battles have they fought?
Where are their gallant chieftains who
have met the enemy in the open plain?
Instead of war we have had only stories of
conflagration, incendiarism, dynamite, de
struction of property and assassination.
"If I had my way the first time that an
outrage is committed on any one of our
own citizens in Cuba I would send our
navy to the island. I would send 10,000
men to rescue any American citizen from
wrong and oppression. And the question
is whether we shall, in the dark, without
information, take a measure which would
affect our friendly relations with Spain
and on which may depend such a mo
mentous question as that of peace and
war."
Turner was followed on the opposite
side of the question by Smith (R.) of
Michigan, who expressed his surprise that
a distinguished lawyer like the gentleman
from Georgia would question the right of
the United States to recognize the bel
ligerency of the insurgents, because it had
been decided in the Supreme Court of the
United States in the prize cases that the
power to control the established govern
ment entitled those who exercised such
power to the rights of belligerency.
As to the President of â¢ the Cuban repub
lic being a citizen of the United States
Smith asked Turner to look at the picture
of Lafayette on the wall near himâ the
picture of one who God inspired to come
to America from â  the land of France to
help the struggling colonists. He recalled
also the services of Pulaski and Kosciusko
in the cause of American freedom, and
asked whether the people, of the United
States would refuse to give their sym
pathies and services to the cause of other
people struggling for their liberties. The
island of Cuba was as large as the State of
New York and had before it a magnificent
future.
Boutelle (R.) of Maine asked Smith
whether the effect of the resolutions would
not be to surrender all claims against
Spain which American citizens in Cuba
had for the destruction of their property.
Smith denied '. that the resolutions would
have any such effect. In the. course of his
remarks he referred to the Spanish in
quisition.
"The Spanish inquisition!" Boutelle re
peated in a tonebf derision; ; "I.ask unani
mous consent that the Spanish inquisition
be abolished." '.";. â 'â '' 7'- 'â ''".
Smith remarked that the Spanish in
quisition existed to-day in the island of
Cuba, and that the only.redress for the de
struction of ; American 'property "there

would come by driving the Spaniards out
of the island. '"Spain," he exclaimed, "is
the greatest tyrant in the civilized world
to-day."
Boutelle opposed the resolutions. "He
commenced with the sarcastic remark that
he hardly expected to convince all the
members of the House that their public
duty did not require them to vote for the
resolutions. He desired, however, to em
phasize his expression of a few days ago,
when be objected to the summary dis
position of a question of r. the gravest char
acter by what ought to be (in the absence
of conservatism in :-' the \ Senate) the con
servative body of Congress. He" had at
that time . disliked exceedingly to j inter
pose an objection to the proposition made
by the chairman of the . Committee on
Foreign Affairs," and nothing but a strong
sense of public duty would have im
pelled him to do so. *If he needed
any ; justification he . found it]:, in
the fact that objection then made to hasty
consideration of the resolutions had had
at least the effect of having one of them
revised by the chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs. That gentleman had
deemed it wise to modify the form of one
of the resolutions, and he (Boutelle) agreed
with Hitt in the wisdom of that modifica
tion. He spoke to-day for those members
of the House, who were more numerous
than was supposed, who, whatever were
their sympathies with regard to the
struggle in Cuba, had grave doubts as to
the expediency or propriety of the House
of Representatives voting "a practical
declaration of war against a power with
which we are now at peace," under a sus
pension of the rules.
He was opposed to passing such an im
portant resolution without a fair amount
of discussion and without essential delib
eration. His judgment was against com
mitting the Government to a course which
might turn the whole trend of public
affairs from the paths and avocations of
peace to those of war. 'He was not "enam
ored with the prospect* of war. He was
not afraid to stand in his place and say
that he deprecated war. There 'was
nothing seductive about the prospects of
war. "War was horrible and was only to
be entered upon when honor and neces
sity demanded it.
He did hot mean to say that the adop
tion of the resolutions would necessitate or
produce war, but he would say that it was
the entering wedge. The House was en
tering upon a course which mi_ht]lead to
war, and that, whether rightfully or
wrongfully, the House ] ought ! not to do
that under a suspension of the rules, but

only in accordance with every rule of de
liberation to safeguard such action. [Some
applause.] He repeated that the repre
sentatives of the American people should
hot proceed in a matter of this kind with
unseemly haste. " *
Cummings (D.) of New York advocated
the resolutions. The gentleman from
Maine (Boutelle), he said," objected on ac
count of lack of information. If that gen
tleman had read the proclamations of
General Weyler he had â '; all; the informa
tion he desired. If General Grant, when
made commander of the American army,
had issued such proclamations, the whole
civilized world would havj gasped in hor
ror and every nation ,^w,">Â»;}d] have recog
nize J the Confederate :^ He (Cum
minga) 1 would not compare Weyler with
Alva or with Balihaceda; nor would he
call him a wolf, 'as he had been called-in
the Senate: but he would say of lim'that
he was "a Gila monster of ) despotism,"
[laughter] and \ applause] poisoning ' with
his breath the atmosphere of American
civilization. ' :
, In answer to Turner's argument as to
! the Cuban patriots having no territory or j
capital, Cum mm gs asserted that they held
more ground in Cuba than the Confeder- \
acy had held (in proportion) one year ,
after the firing oh Fort Sumter. And he
also declared that if General John C. Breck- j
inridge and General Early had maintained i
their position around Washington as long !
as Maceo and Gomez had maintained
theirs around Havana the prospects of the
Confederacj- would have been much
brighter than th'Â»y] we're at the time of the j
battle of Bull Ilun. [Applause.]
McCall (R.) of Massachusetts opposed i
the resolutions. " He yielded for no one in I
sympathy for the Cuban patriots, but the j
House of Representatives should be gov- I
erned not by -its * "sympathy but by !
its., judgment; and should not start
out with haste : and enthusiasm on a i
pathway which ; might lead the country |
into war. The fact that there were many
American citizens in Cuba might count for
nothing. The' fact that 'the millions of j
American capital that were invested might \
count for nothing. The fact that the busi- â¢
ness men of this* country had been over- |
whelmed with burdens for the last three 'â¢
years might count for nothing.* But it i
seemed' to him that* the Committee on j
Foreign : Affairs r should give* to the House |
(if it was going to usurp legislative func
tions) some definite information as to the
effect which., the resolutions would have
on the people of the island: He under
stood that the benefits to be conferred by |
belligerency were very vague, : and * that j
under international law Spain would de
rive about the same benefits as the Cabans.
â¢ Moody (R.) of Massachusetts also op
posed the resolutions ind; expressed his
concurrence.with the views of Boutelle.
Tucker (D.) of Virginia said. that as the
only member of the Committee on For
eign Relations who opposed the resolutions
he "felt like one who treads alone some
banquet-hall ; deserted," but that he must
not be diverted because of the Unanimity
of the sentiment expressed by his brother
members of . the committee. The plain
English of the resolutions was, he said, if
Spain did not grant the' Cuban patriots
(so nailed) a government s of their own,
based upon the choice of, the people, .then,
the â United States was to give it to them by]
force of arms. -* Â. .-'.;. 'â â :â ' 7 .',*
t "The Southern people," Tucker contin
ued, "are not for war. They; have had
enough of r it. . They : know what it is.
They have borne the burden, and heat of
the day ' through four years of war, and
they know what it means. \ They are to
day pursuing their peaceful; avocations.
When the proper time comes they will
come to the support of this Government
and defend its interests against attack.
But to-day without cause, except sympa
thy, we are boldly and defiantly challeng
ing war with Spain. This resolution, in
my judgment, should not be passed."
Tucker's speech closed the arguments in
opposition and then the arguments in
support of them were wound up by Hitt.
He expressed 'his hearty concurrence' in
the views expressed by Boutelle and Tur
ner as to appreciation of the gravity cf the
hour. The Committee on Foreign Affairs
had considered the subject for two months.
Nearly six months ago, said Hitt, the re
ports showed that there were 25.C00 men
in arms defending the organization of the
Cuban republic. 'So that the revolution
ists had an armed force, even if they had
not altogether a government. They had a
great organized movement and that was
belligerency and war, "and was entitled to
recognition. . ...
] "We are hot seeking a war," Hitt con
tinued, "nor is the" Government of Spain.
A telegram which I have received from
the Secretary of Stale while this debate has
been progressing shows how utterly un
likely it is that an attempt will be mane
by Spain to pick a ; quarrel with us. and to
brine on an 'unnecessary war. The tele
gram read:* 'I have' received a; dispatch
from Taylor, United States Minister at
Madrid,' which I think your committee and
members of the House should know ; Min
ister of State has just called toexpress deep
regret that the'moh has insulted Barcelona

complete reparation, and informed me that
his Government, on its own motion, has
taken every precaution to guard legation." ,
*, Boutelle; asked Hitt what impression
that dispatch had made on his mind. He
added that it should prevent â¢ hasty action
in taking a course that would provoke hos
tilities with a nation that manifested so
strong a desire to deal; with us in amity
and peace. [Applause.]
; Hitt expressed his belief that the resolu
tions would not bririÂ£ any consequence
that could possibly bring , regret. The
resolutions were important. The House
was willing to do its duty. But the reso
lutions were not bluster. Tney, were wise
and conservative. The right of search
might, as General Grant had said, bring
perilous collision; but, as had been just
shown, Spain was not seeking, a quarrel.
; The debate here closed, and several
propositions for a division in resolutions
and for separate votes on them were ruled
out by the Speaker.
At. 3:45 the previous question was or
dered, and on a viva voce vote the ques
tion of adopting the House resolutions
was agreed to, the few dissenting, votes
being drowned in the chorus of "Yeas."
;'â¢ The ayes and noes were then demanded
and the Cuban resolutions were agreed to
by ; a vote â¢of 263 to 17. ' Those voting in

GREAT JOY AT THE UNIVERSITY
College Students Arrange a Big Cele
bration After Receiving the
Good News.
WASHINGTON, D. C., March The
efforts of the United States authorities to
collect from the estate of the late Senator
Leland Stanford of California $15,237,000
has been unsuccessful all along the line.
Justice Harlan, speaking for the Supreme
Court of the United States, to-day de
clared that no liability attached to the
estate upon the grounds set forth by the
Government, and thus ended the litiga
tion.
The case was begun in the Circuit Court
for the Southern District of California, the
bill proceeding upon the ground that the
constitution and laws of California at the
time the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany of California and - the Western Pa
j cific Railroad Company, which were con-
I solidated as the Central Pacific Railroad
Company, were organized as well as when
\ they received the bonds of the United
States held each stockholder liable in pro
' portion to the stock held by â¢ him, for
'. all- its debts and liabilities and, conse
quently, that the estate of Stanford was
; liable to the United States in the sum
| named, that being his proportion of the
! bonds advanced to the railroad company
i and now overdue and unpaid. ; The Cir
| cuit Court dismissed the bill -and that
judgment was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals, from which latter court the At
torney-General brought the case to the
Supreme Court of the United States.
The appeal was argued in January last
just before the ; recess, Joseph H. Cboate
! appearing for Mrs. Stanford and Solicitor-
General Conrad and Assistant Attorney
: General . Dickinson .* for the Government.
; Owing to the magnitude of the : claim and
j the consequent interests involved, one of
| them being.lhe fate of Leland Stanford Jr. -
University in California, the case excited
an interest that was; limited only by the
extent of ;. the country. ; Discussing the
I questions presented Judge Harlan asked:
"Was it part of the contract between the
United States and I the corporations re
ceiving its subsidy bonds that the stock
holders of such corporations respectively
should be personally, liable .for the princi
pal I and interest of these bonds? '.'* Or did
the. United States make provision in the'
' acts of Congress for. all the security in
-1 tended to be taken for their payments? {
"These questions could only be answered
by examining the provisions of all these
acts in the light of the circumstances under
which the United- States made; grants "of
lands and provided for the issuing of bonds
in aid of the construction of the railroad
, and . telegraph lines from the Missouri
River to the Pacific Coast."
- The opinion reviewed at length the acts
of 1862/1864 and 1865, from which review,
said Justice Harlan, it appeared-" that they
related to the same general subjects, and
must be regarded as one enactment for the
purpose of ascertaining the object of Con
gress.
That case was no longer a 'subject of in
quiry by the Supreme Court of the United
Statesâ having been settled in the case of
the United .States vs. the Union Pacific
Railroad Company, decided by Justice
Davis and reported in ninety-first United
Statesâ which declared the building of a
railroad from the Missouri â  River ,to the
Pacific Ocean to be a National work. .
* The next question was did " Congress
make any and if so what provision to se
cure the United States against liability on
account of its bonds, issued in aid of the
construction of the National highway?
The important fact disclosed by the Pa
cific Railroad acts, said Justice Harlan,
; was that none of them contained any
I clause imposing . upon the stockholders of
corporations' receiving subsidy bonds per
sonal responsibility for any debt due the
! United States from such corporations by
reason of its failure to pay those bonds at
maturity. * ' ; ":
"It is not too much to say," the opinion
continues, "that if the acts of 1862-64 had
made stockholders of * the corporations
therein named personally liable in propor
tion to their stock for the repayment of
the bonds delivered to, such" corporation
the accomplishing of the objects Congress
had in view would have been seriously re
tarded if not wholly defeated."
It: was" not claimed, said- the Justice,
that any such" liability was imposed upon
the stockholders of the Union Pacific
Company, and the position that it did at
tach to Central Pacific stockholders could
: be sustained only upon the theory that
Congress intended to take a larger security
in respect of that corporation than of the
Union Pacific. 'â './'' Â 'â ';â .
7- But there was nothing in the legislation
of Congress from which that could be con
ferred. Throughout the whole of the acts
is manifest the purpose that the California
corporation should enjoy the rights, immu
nities, benefits^andjprivi'eges given to it
upon the " same terms , and conditions 'as
were prescribed for the Union Pacific.
In conclusion the opinion said: 77-.
"The relations between; the, California
corporations Â and the State were of
no concern .to the National Govern
ment. -Congress ; chose this . existing
artificial ,\ being jas an instrumentality
to accomplish National ends, and ; the ; re-*
lations between : the {United^States and .

by : the ;â  r enactments which established
those relations; and if those enactmentss â Â
do not expressly ,' nor by implication sub- i
ject the stockholders ) to liability .' : for P. it
debts, it is to be presumed that Congress2
intended to waive its right to impose any

MAGUIRE ON THE DECISION.
It Is a Precedent That California Courts
Can't Follow.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March Rep
resentative Maguire was asked by The
Call correspondent to-night what he
thought of the decision in the Stanford
case and he said: v'
"The decision is, in effect, that a stock
holder in a corporation tinder the laws of
California is not liable for his proportion
of the debts of the corporation unless at
the time of the contraction of the debts
the creditor had in mind the stockholders'
liability and intended to hold them for the
debt.
"I would not advise a stockholder of any
ordinary corporation in California to make
such a defense to a creditor's 'suit, because
I feel; certain. that the doctrine of the
United States versus Stanford will not be
followed out by our courts. I think it will
be overruled in the next case that arises.
But it is conclusive for the purposes of the
present case.
"It is unfortunate that cases have
arisen in judicial procedure to obstruct
the regular current of decisions, because the
failure to apply ordinary rules of construc
tion and decision to them tends to bring
our judicial system into disrepute.
"It would be much better if such decis
ions could be avoided by a general law
declaring that any claim in excess of say
$5,000,000 is beyond the jurisdiction of
courts of this country."
Maguire was asked what he thought of
Attorney-General Harmon's letter to the
Pacific Railroad Committee. He said :
"I think the Attorney-General's opinion
on the question of the liability of fraudu
lent directors of Pacific Railroad com
panies was unwarranted and inopportune.
He is not the adviser pf committees of
Congress and should have refused to give
an offhand reply to such questions. His
answer, of course, is unofficial and merely
personal.
"He may be called upon hereafter to
investigate that very matter officially, and
should have, avoided the embarrassment
which too much unofficial talk and writ
ing in advance may occasion him. His
predecessors, so far as I know, have al
ways refused to answer such conundrums
from committees of Congress."
PREDICTED BY ''THE CaLL."
Therefore No Little surprise Among
Califomians.
. WASHINGTON, D. C, March The
decision of the. United States Supreme
Court in the Stanford case, handed down
by Justice Harlan to-day in favor of Mrs.
Stanford, occasioned no surprise among
Californians in Washington, as it has been
almost a foregone conclusion since the
arguments Were made that Mrs. Stanford
would win. It was conceded by lawyers
who were not in sympathy with the rail
road. The decision was foreshadowed in
The Call's dispatches February 1 as
follows:
WASHINGTON, D. c, Feb. 1.-The Call
correspondent learned to-night that there is a
probability that the decision of the United
States Supreme Court to the Stanford case will
be handed down soon. This news comes
from the highest authority and further with a
strong indication that the decision will be in
favor of Mrs. Stanford.
JOY OF THE STUDENTS.
Great Is the juicing at Stanford
Sis*' University.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY,CaI., March
_. â This morning about 11:30 the rumor
became current that the final decision in
the great Stanford suit had been handed
down ? and that the result was favorable to
the university. * v ' ."*./.. s .:*v
Instantly the whistle on the power-house
sounded the Stanford slogan and at each
toot swarms of students "came running
from their recitations and the quadrangle
was soon black witn a shouting, gesticu
lating multitude of men and co-eds; every
body seemed wild with excitement, and,
while the result was generally expected,
the removal of suspense was like taking
off the guard from a steam boilerâ there
was an explosion. Soon everybody began
asking every body else just what news had
been received, but no one could answer
authoritatively.
"On to Dr. Jordan's home!" became the
cry, and in the rain struggled a thousand
students toward the president's residence.
Dr. Jordan was already on his way to the
office and met the students half-way over.
He wanted to know whether any authentic
news had been received, and stated to the
disappointed students that he had had no
persona! informatian concerning the suit.
"However," said the % president, "the
news should be as you have guessed, but I
don't want to become excited until we as
certain positively. In case the favorable
opinion has been rendered my ideas about
it have been made known' so frequently
that I could add little to them. I may say
that if it is as we hope, the students are at
liberty to paint everything cardinal except
the statues in the museum.
"With drums and cymbals Dr. Jordan
was then escorted to the chapel, which was
jammed with a shouting mob, and yet it
was not a mob, for the student body execu
tive committee had already partly decided
on it? plan of action. It was several min
utes before the chairman could make him
self heard, and Dr. Jordan â¢ announced
from the platform that the decision ended
the long litigation which had -weighed so
heavily on the noblest woman in the world.
He told something of the sacrifices that
Mrs. Stanford had' made, and concluded
with "No one can ever understand or ap
preciate the magnitude of the trials and
sacrifices which Mrs. Stanford has been
forced to undergo during the past three
years, for this university."
President Sheldon of the Associated Stu
dents then announced that the executive
â¢ committee and band members should meet
directly after the meeting. Cheers were
given for everybody, from Mrs. Stanford
and Dr. Jordan to Rufus Choate and Jus
tice Harlan. A collection was voted for
fireworks, which amounted to $90 or $100.
Students then took to wearing the stars
and stripes and the flag was run up on the
campus and cheered to the echo. Many
students got along without lunch, so ex
cited were they all, and as the sun began
shining small bands marched about the
campus with gongs and horns, making the
â walls resound with their noise. A cannon
was procured at Mayfield and. salutes were
fired at regular intervals throughout the
afternoon.
From noon until night excitement here
continued to increase. During the after
noon a cannon was procured from a neigh
' boring town, and while it would never be
of much use in war it tilled the purpose of
firing salutes admirably. School children
from adjacent districts gathered on the
campus to assist in the celebration, and
horns were kept blowing constantly.
Small crowds of students gathered at
corners and between Stanford yells dis
cussed the probable results of the decision
Each one had his own idea what would
result now that Stanford is really the rich
est university in the world. Most of the
students, however, were too much excited
to talk rationally on any subject, but acted
fairly hysterically.
Electrical engineers spent time in far
ranging an electrical display which . at
tracted much attention later in the even
ing. It was nothing less than the Stanford
yell in cardinal letters. Worked by alter
nating flashes :of electricity, the immense
red letters showed out in brilliant rays
which caused great ; enthusiasm at each
touch of the electric button.
In the evening at 7 o'clock the quad
rangle was crowded with ; students carry
ing lanterns, torches and every conceiv
able ear-torturing device, from a shotgun
with blank cartridges to ; saucepan â ' and
pewter soup-ladle. Cardinal was inter
mingled everywhere with the colors of the
American flag. ' -
The co-eds were out in force; their
dresses and hats Were trimmed with the
prevailing hue, contrasted with their
torches, and made a pretty picture, one
seldom seen in any institution.
For more than an hour this â  vast con
course of howling students marched about
the quadrangle singing university songs
mingled with National songs. At 8 o'clock
the march was taken up to Encina Gym
nasium, where speeches were scheduled to
take place.
Fully 1000 people managed to jam them
selves inside the doors. A band had been
brought out for the occasion, and the roof
was fairly lifted off its supporting walls
by the din. President Sheldon of the stu
dent body introduced each speaker with
appropriate remarks, and with every sen
tence of the speakers the audience broke
into cheers. .
Mrs. Stanford was not present, but the
following letter was read from her:
To the Students: I cannot refrain from saying
that I am profoundly thankful to the ministers
of the law at their just decision, and I thank
you one and all for your loyalty throughout
the past year of doubt and uncertainty, and
now you can rejoice to your hearts' content,
while I will remain quietly at home and be
thankful. Yours, always,
Jake L. Stanford.
San Francisco, Cal., March 2, 1896.
President Jordan said: -',
"Friends and students: You may not
have noticed it, but I have made my
speech while you were yelling. I believe
this is not the second time I have spoken
to-day. I have spoken very many times
since the news was received. It came to
my attention as soon as I had received
this message that the world has seen
many changes.
"I remember once when I was traveling
down in Kentucky that I slept one night
on the floor with Judge Harlan. That was
twenty years ago. I was thinking this
afternoon that I was almost sorry that it
was over. We have been for the last three
years under a cloud.
"One gets used to that kind of thing and
I more than any one elso, because I was a
college president. I was leading a forlorn
hope. As Senator Stanford said once he
thought I made a better president at Stan-
I ford than I would at Harvard.
"Then, too, I had made up my mind to
finish up my college career in a pictur
esque way. All this is passed away, and
the forlorn hope is passed away too.
Down in San Antonio there was an
old padre * who sold tiles and geese,
and I had made up my mind to flood the
quadrangle here, live all alone and sell
tiles from the chapel roof . and geese like
the old padre, but this hope is now
banished. 1 was going to say something
about the way in which these three years
have solidified usâ how they have given
us strength and hope for the future. I
mink all of us can feel what this must
mean to the woman who has waited for so
long a time for this result.
"What a lesson in self-devotion that
must be, in order, as : Mr., Stanford once
said, 'that the children of California shall
bii my children.' (Three cheers were given
for Mrs. Stanford.) And now that is' all
that I have to say to-night."
Lester J. Hinsdill spoke for the class of
'95, and said that this time marked the be
ginning of the students' real career at the
university.
E. A. Ross spoke for the faculty. H. H.
Brown addressed the assembly for the
class of '96 and made a very eloquent
speech, specially praising Mrs. Stanford.
Burton M. Palmer, for the class of '97, read
an original poem on the occasion, which
was very clever in thought, and elicited
salvos of applause.
The students concluded the evening
with a display of fireworks on the campus,
while a few of the most enthusiastic, un
deterred by the cold wind, marched down
to Palo Alto and, after some cheering, dis
persed. *
TR IB ULATIONS OF THE Sill.
Mrs. Stanford Tells of the Silent Grief
Suffered.
Mrs. Stanford came up from Palo Alto
yesterday morning and went to her resi
dence on California street. About 11
o'clock a telegram came from Senator Per-
kins, expressing congratulations and say
ing that the decision had been unanimous
for her. After that congratulatory mes
sages came in thick and fast from different
Senators and from friends all over the
Union. . .
A representative from the student body
called during the afternoon and requested
Mrs. Stanford to be present at the evening
celebration on the campus, and insisted
that she should go back to Palo Alto. -C
"But, I told him," said Mrs. Stanford,
"that the excitement -of the day had been
so great that I hardly dared to take part
in that celebration. And then I wrote a
little. note in pencil, for he said the stu
dents would, rather have it in my hand
writing than typewritten by my secretary,
and the young man went away happy.
"I shall be with them in sympathy," but
I want to stay here and answer those tele
grams; and there is .such a lot of them,
they keep piling up all the time. lam
going to have them bound and preseved in
the archives of the university. They will,
be interesting reading in after years to the
students who have stood so faithfully by
the university and by me during the long
period of uncertainty.
"A person at my age is past a feeling of
wild hilarity over any event. I had just
settled down quietly hoping that it might
come and trusting in God. I hare given
up thinking sadly over the great griefs I
have experienced. My life and ambition
have been in ; the university and to see it
succeed has become the cherished object
of my existence.
"My friends thought that I ought not to
go on to Washington, because I was not
well enough. But the telegram came and
I asked them who else there- was to go. I
went and I came back better. The divine
providence in which 1 have constantly
trusted has rewarded me and this is: the
result. â¢
-.* "Why, the people in \\ ashington are as
much elated as \ the* people fof; California.
I was surprised at the interest taken. Oh,
no; it is not for me alone; it is for the
university they rejoice. -' It is a cause of
humanity. In a few y^ars I shall be dead
and gone, but the university and its use
fulness shall live on."
And then Mrs. Stanford spoke of a stu
dents' prayer-meeting in the university
chapel that sfte't had attended the evening
before; ho w she sat in i the j back of - the
room listening to the * indi/idual ; expres
sions from some of the several ; hundred

ing in the Moody and Sankey hymns.
"As different ones called for a favorite
hymn," remarked Mrs. Stanford, "I asked
for 'More Holiness Give Me,' for that is
my favorite ; and then ; Ij. called tor the
Senator's favorite, 'Let the Lights Be
Burning."'
Turning from the students, to whom she
fondly reverted again and again, Mrs.
Stanford spoke of her husband, and con
fessed,; now that ; it was ; all , settled; there
had been during all these years' trying
ordeal of uncertainty attached to the Gov
ernment suit a personal tribulation that
the public had never realized. It was her
silent grief that the . existence of the suit
imputed to her husband the slightest
wrong ever done or intended to the people
of California.
PRESIDENT JORDAN'S TIEWS.
Tells How the University Will Be Bene-
filed by the Decision.
President Jordan of Stanford University,
when seen yesterday afternoon regarding
the favorable decision' by ; the Supreme
Court, said that the "115,000,000 suit bad
meant either that . Stanford University
should in future be among the little strug
gling colleges of the country or one of the
great universities of the land. The settle
ment in Mrs;' Stanford's favor, he declared,
found the estate in good condition and
every debt paid.
The estate cannot be again imperiled.
Contrary to common supposition, how
ever, the university will not be immedi
ately at liberty to use the funds freely, as,
first of all, the legacies, amounting to
$4,000,000, must be paid. Of this amount
$3,000,000, by the provision of Senator
Stanford's will, goes to the university and
$1,500,000 is for individuals. But even of
this sum $1,000,000 will eventually be re
turned to the university, for this is the
legacy left to Thomas Stanford of Sydney,
Australia, the millionaire brother of the
late Senator. Thomas Stanford some time
ago declared his intention to endow the
university with the amount of his legacy
as soon as it should be paid to him.
The legacies will be paid as soon as pos
sible, but it is not likely that the railroad
will wish Mrs. Stanford -to withdraw so
! much cash on short. notice. The result is,
continued Dr. Jordan, that it may be a
year or two before everything is settled so
that the university may be the only claim
ant upon the Stanford resources.
When asked how the defeat of the fund
ing bill would affect the university "now
Dr. Jordan expressed reluctance to be
identified with the matter, but said that
Mrs. Stanford's loss in such an event
would probably amount to only $300,000 or
$400,000, a small matter compared with the
great suit just settled. -.
Remarking upon the income from the
estate Dr. Jordan said it used to amount to
$1,000,000 per annum, but he could not say
what it is now since the depreciation of
some of the properties.
Dr. Jordan left the university for this
City by a late forenoon train, but shortly
before his departure he was apprised that
something had happened, as hundreds of
boys came rushing over to his house from
the recitation-rooms ; in the quadrangle,
beating drums and yelling, all with' one
wild accord, instinctively celebrating the
favorable result of the suit, but none
knowing where the news had come from.
At Palo Alto Dr. Jordan received a con
gratulatory telegram from Banker Lilien
thal of this City, and that was the first
plausible information he had. During the
afternoon, as he was busily engaged in the
Academy of Sciences, the news seemed" to
come from, everywhere, and Dr. Jordan be
coming convinced, arranged to- leave last
night's ; meeting in charge ,of the Âv icep
resident and started back to the univer
sity, as he smilingly expressed it, "to be
with the boys."
DENOUNCED BY NEGROES.
Washington Pastors Cry Out
Against the Leniency Shown
Miss Flagler.
Had She Been Colored They Declare
She Would Have Been Shown
No Mercy.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 2.â A Her
ald special from Washington says: In an
ticipation "that the clergymen would
speak on the trial and sentence of Miss
Flagler for the shooting of the young ne
gro Ernest Green some months ago, the
colored churches here were more largely
attended than usual yesterday, and when
there were harsh criticisms of the Judge
and the District Attorney they were fol
lowed by applause.
By far the largest attendance was 'at the
Shiloh Baptist . Church, to which Ernest
Green 'belonged. The: Rev. J. A. Taylor,
the pastor, made no reference to the affair,
doing so, he said afterward, out of defer
ence to the wishes of the Green family.
Rev. George W. Lee, pastor of the Ver
mont-avenue Bapt ; st : Church, the largest
colored congregation here, said that every
negro in the district ought to repudiate
such a failure of justice as occurred in the
Flagler case. He declared that if the pris
oner had been a negress she would now be
in Albany serving time, but because Miss
Flagler was a white woman, \ and the
daughter of a: wealthy and influential
man, her violation of . the* law had been
countenanced, and even the Judge had
partaken of the iniquity of her crime.
Dr. J. T. Jenife, pastor of the Metropoli
tan Church, the leading church of * the
African Methodist Episcopal denomina
tion, said it was gratifying to him that both
white and colored were unanimous' in de
nouncing the outrageous outcome of the
case. '* He believed it showed to the coun
try how much justice* the negro received
in the National capital, so far as Judges
and courts were concerned. "He thought
the entire populace should join ; in â  de
nouncing the conduct of Judge and Dis
trict Attorney, and in praying ",' for the
opening of a new era for the' colored people
here. - ;
', Dr. Walter H. Brooks of the Nineteenth
street -Baptist Church expressed himself
as shocked at the outcome of the case, but
said he was not surprised, as it was almost
impossible for the negro to secure justice
in any of the courts., â¢' He thought such in
justice would be continued until the Na
tion awoke to the iniquity of the discrim
ination. .""'"â â 
It is not improbable that during the
week the colored residents of -Washington;
will meet and put themselves on record as
disapproving of the conduct of Judge Cox
and District Attorney Birney.

THROVE ASIDE THE MASK
Holmes, the Murderous Swindler,
Appears to Be in a Repent
ant Mood. ' .
Sends for a Spiritual Adviser and
Abandons the Plan to Commit .
Suicide.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 2.-H.
H. Holmes, the murderer of Benjamin
F. Pitzel, has thrown aside the mask and
embraced the opportunity for consul
tation with a spiritual adviser. Ever
since his arrest on the charge of defraud
ing the Fidelity Company of $10,000 in
surance Holmes has assumed an air of
bravado. He was so self-possessed that
even when the charge of murder was made,
following the investigation by the author
ities, he never flinched. â < -,
Like many other murderers, Holmes now
appears in his true light. The air of bra
vado assumed for the occasion has disap
peared and Holmes practically says that
he is afraid to die. A few days ago he
wrote" to Archbishop Ryan, asking that the
prelate send to him 'a, priest with ] whom
he might confer. This request was com
plied with, and the Archbishop wrote to
the Rev. Dr. P. J. Daily, rector of . the
Church of the Annunciation, in whose
parish Moyamensing prison is.
Father Daily has paid three visits to
Holmes, but he declines to what took
place, except that he gave the murderer
good books to read. He* speaks kindly of
.Holmes, but beyond that is reticent. The;
change in the man's demeanor is favor
ably commented upon by attaches of the
District Attorney's office. For a long time
it was rumored that Holmes would never
be hanger' and that if ; convicted he would
cheat the gallows by committing suicide.
. Assistant District Attorney Barlow said
that the fact that Holmes : is conferring
with the priest is sufficient evidence that
he does '-' not intend to commit suicide.
Barlow firmly believes that Holmes will
retain his self-possession, although he has
deserted the stand he had taken and is un
doubtedly frightened by the prospects of
death in the near future.;
WILL ATTEMPT GERMICIDE.
There Appears to Be No Limit to the Value
7.-: of. the Ray.
MILWAUKEE, Wis.,^March 2.-Dr.
Horace Manchester of this city
made what is believed to be an important
discovery in the use of the X ray, by which
he took two : photographs situated | practi
cally at right angles from 'the direction of
the , ray. This i was accomplished iby the
use of a magnet with a lifting power of one
and a half pounds.
: With this he developed the ray, making
a photograph of one object with the direct
ray and another, at* a right angle to it.
This method requires twice the length of
time i for i the exposure, as the strength' of
the ray is weakened in developing it. *>
'Brown yesterday photographed a bullet'
in the leg of Sevier Klein, which had been
Imbedded against the bone since February
23 by an exposure of one hour. He cut
into the leg * and 1 found * the bullet at : the
point shown in the photograph. His next
experiment will be to try to kill-pus germs
with the X ray, which is believed to be a
germicide. V * ; -

KID M'COY
THE WINNER
Surprises the Spectators
by Defeating Tommy
Ryan. V:
BOTH FIGHT PLUCKILY.
Victory Won in the , Fifteenth
Round by a Most Vicious
Uppercut.
RECEIVES SEVERE PUNISHMENT
Ryan, Who Was Thought to Have an
Easy Thing, Beaten Un
mercifully.
MASPETH, L. 1., March 2.â A 20-round
"go" between Tommy Ryan and "Kid"
McCoy was the principal , attraction at
the; Empire Athletic Club to-night. A
large crowd was in attendance. Ryan's
last appearance at the Coney Island Ath
letic Club in his battle with the "Mysteri
ous" Billy Smith lingered in the minds of
many of the spectators, and odds of 4 to 1
were laid on him. Tim Hurst was referee
and Frank Sheehan held the watch. The
curtain-raiser was an eight-round bout be
tween Jack Downey of Brooklyn ;. and
Larry Burns of Cohoes. * It resulted in a
draw. â¢' - â 
The stars of the evening were the next
to put in an appearance. Ryan said he
scaled 148 pounds; McCoy weighed - 155
pounds. Time was called at 10 o'clock,
and Ryan immediately began his rushing
tactics, but was met by McCoy with
several hard knocks on the face. From
this on Ryan acted more on the defensive.
McCoy showed great cleverness, and sur
prised the spectators. Up to the sixth
round it was easily McCoy's fight.
In the seventh round Ryan once more
assumed the aggressive and the "Kid"
clinched to save himself. In the eighth
Ryan attacked â ; and punished his man
with the left hard on the head. The "Kid"
rushed, again and Ryan turned. Ryan
swung his left on the jaw and nearly sent
McCoy against â  the ropes. McCoy rushed
at his man and punished him right and
left on the jaw, knocking him down.
Ryan took nine seconds and then got up.
McCoy rushed him again and punished
him almost to a standstill when the bell
rang. In the ninth McCoy rushed his
man all over the ring and floored him
again with a left-hand swing on the jaw.
i Finally Ryan clinched to save himself.
Nothing much was done in the tenth
round, but ... from the beginning of the
eleventh ' till the gong sounded McCoy
punched his opponent right and left.
Ryan's face presented a horrible sight.
He was groggy and only saved himself by
clinching. Ryan was floored again in the
twelfth by a right-hand swing on the jaw.
â  "-- From this on * McCoy did about as he
pleased with Ryan, who remained game
to the core. Finally, in the fifteenth
round the "Kid" uppercut his man with
the left, drove his right on the stomach
and knocked Ryan down twice. Ryan got
up only to be pushed down again. â  This
time Ryan stayed; down and was slowly
counted out. The round lasted 1 minute
54 seconds.
The result of the fight was one of the
biggest surprises in the fistic arena lor
some time.' Ryan was looked upon as a
certain winner. ; -^ .

yDEBTS OF THE
PACIFIC ROADS.
Morrison Appears for the
Union First Mortgage
Bondholders.
ONE PLAN IS OPPOSED.
Fitzgerald's Method Simply a
Scheme to Promote Junior
Holdings.
NOW COMES FORWARD HARMON
The Attorney-General Answers Some
Questions Propounded by the
House Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 2.â The
House Committee on Pacific Railroads to
day continued its inquiry into matters per
taining to the Pacific railroads. L. J.
Morrison, representing a portion of the
ffrst mortgage bondholders of the Union
Pacific, said that those he represented
could not accept the Fitzgerald plan. It
was not practicable, being simply a
scheme to promote junior holdings.
The Government, be said, was in tbe
same position as his clients, and what
would benefit one would benefit the other.
His proposition was to have Congress
authorize the appointment of acommis-
sion whose duty it should be to enforce the
lien of the Government by foreclosure.
When the lien was foreclosed a new
company was to be created to own prop
erty of the old corporations. He under
stood that the Fitzgerald people had
abandoned their plan.
The committee then adjourned until
Wednesday*
HARMON ANSWERS QUESTIONS.
Views of the Attorney- General on Debts
of the Pacific Roads.
. WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2.â The
Attorney-General sent to the House Com
mittee on Pacific Railroads the following
letter replying to questions submitted to
him in a resolution adopted by the com
mittee:
First questionâ Whether the officers and di
rectors of the bond-aided Pacific railroads In
curred any liability to the United States by
the unlawful issue of the stock of said com
panies.
Answerâ lf the officers and directors of any
company knowingly made or permitted any
Unlawful issue of stock thereof, they became
personally liable to the company, or to its
lawful stockholders, but not to the United
States, which was merely a creditor. The
rights of creditors could not be affected by the
improper issue of stock, which merely repre
sents the property of the company, but does
not dispose of or incumber it.
Secondâ Whether said officers and directors
Incurred any liability to their respective com
panies or to the United States for the profits on
contracts made with themselves or persons
representing- the - for the construction of said
railroad?. BSf^H
Answerâ lf officers and directors made con
tracts with themselves or with persons repre
senting them, to their own profit or the detri
ment of the company, they became liable to it
unles" such contracts were knowingly author
ized or ratified by a majority of the directors
having no interest' therein, or by the stock
holders; but they did not become liable to the
United States.. .
Thirdâ Whether the United States, as a cred
itor of the said corporation, can maintain ac
tions in its own name against said parties
for the enforcement of said liability; if it ex
ists until all remedies to enforce payment of
all debts owing by the said companies to the
United States have been exhausted.
Answerâ lt was held in the case of the United
States vs. the Union Pacific Railway Company
âknown as the "Credit Mobil ier" caseâ that
such liability was to the respective companies
only. The United' States therefore could not
maintain any action thereon against the guilty
parties, but could assert the rights of the com
pany by a proper suit in equity as a creditor.
. Fourthâ Whether, if such liability exists,
the United States will be barred in any action
! which might be brought for the enforcement
thereof by the statutes of limitation, which
\yould bar the companies if the actions were
brought in their name and behalf. In other
words, whether the United States would be
entitled to maintain action as creditor of said
corporations against its directors and officers
which the corporations themselves could not
maintain.
Answer â As the United States would be
merely asserting the rights of the companies
. as assets to be applied to the* payment of their
creditors, any statute of limitations which
would bar the companies would also bar the
United States.
Fifthâ Whether the facts found and stated
by the Pacific Railroad Commissioners of 1887
In their report to the President are supported
by evidence legally admissible in a court ot
justice.
Answerâ this question means to ask wheth
er evidence before the Pacific Railroad Commis
sioners upon which they found the facts stated
In their report would be admissible in a suit
or action between parties in a court, I answer
generally that the statements made by
any . witnesses would be admissible
aeainst him, but not against any other
person, and that original documents would be
admissible, or copies under the usual rules re
lating to secondary evidence. With these ex
ceptions the evidence would be admissible. I
don't understand the question to ask for my
opinion whether if the commissioners had ap
plied legal rules of evidence the testimony
should have been admitted.
"BURY ME," SMITH WROTE.
{Suicide of a Nebraska Man at Colorado

nizable. .
THE SAL ON ARMY.
Man*) Officers Witling to Rally Under a
New Flag.
CHICAGO, 111.,' March 2.â Personal
interviews with Colonel Eadie, the
* Salvation Army's chief secretary this
country, and conferences of that officer
wit the staff officer of the Northwest
, : division were the order of the day at divi-
X, sion headquarters in this city to-day and
unity of action loyal to the parent body is
not expected in this division.
Brigadier Fielding, who commands the
? division embracing Wisconsin, Michigan,
Indiana and Chicago for thirty, miles
around, is. the -most .conspicuous officer
who has yet declared ' his allegiance to the
international authority, while ; many of
the staff officers, captains of the local sta
tions and the rank and file openly declare
their^ intention of rallying under an
American army flag when it shall be un
furled by their former commander, Bal
lington Booth, and his wife.
SNOW AND FLOODS PREVAIL.
Great Damage Done in Many Eastern Sec
tions, and Traffic Generally
Impeded.
BOSTON, Mass., March 2.â Reports from
places along the Connecticut River in New
Hampshire and Vermont to-night indicate
that the height of. the flood has probably
been reached and the water is slowly re
ceding.
The Merrimac River, however, is grad
ually rising. The weather has grown
much colder and a thick snow prevails.
Many bridges have been swept away,
while others are still in a precarious situa
tion and being closely guarded by gangs of
men.
No report of loss of life has yet been re
ceived. â¢ Railroad traffic throughout the
State is completely demoralized, and in
most places is at a standstill.
PORTLAND. Me.. March 2.â Toe Maine
Central main line between here and Ban-
gor is broken by numerous washouts. All
through trains between Portland and Ban
gor have been canceled until. the road is
safe. ' .
WINSTED, Conn., March 2.âTwenty
four bridges in the county have been
swept away by the flood.
Word from New Boston, Mass., states
that the big dam of Gladwins Bierch Mill
has been completely swept away and the
traffic on the railroads is still impeded.
The foundations of several buildings on
the bank of Mad River loosened. The loss
in the county will exceed $100,000.
ALBANY, N. V., March 2.â At 2:30 this
afternoon the freshet at Albany had fallen
nearly two feet from the highest point and
was still receding steadily. As the waters
recede reports of damage come from local
merchants, and it is apparent that the dam*
age will be quite large. Mayor Thatcher
issued a proclamation to-day asking for
relief for the poor families.
NORTH BERWICK, Me., March 2.â Out
of twenty-one bridges in town, eighteen
have " been washed ' away. Business is
paralyzed.
Drew Lots for the Wife.
WHITE PIGEON, Mich., March 2.-
Edward Jordan of Mottsville was sen
tenced to serve a term of four years at hard
labor in the Jackson (Mich.) Penitentiary.
On his release he returned to his home,
where he expected to be affectionately
greeted by his wife, but .he found her
pledged to another man. The sequel of
the meeting was a proposition by ' Jordan
to draw lots as to which one should claim
his wife. This was done. Jordan lost
and faithfully kept the unique compact.
He parted with his lawful wife. The di
vorce court and a second marriage will
legalize the recent vows made.
GREAT BRITAIN'S NAVY
Estimates for the Proposed In
crease Submitted in the
Commons.
Millions of Pounds Sterling Asked For
and Will Probably Be Readily j
Given.
LONDON, Eng., March 2.â ln the House
of Commons to-day the Right Hon. George
J. Goschen, First Lord of the Admiralty,
presented the navy estimates. He said
the proposed increase in the naval ex
penditures was not due to any feeling of
alarm. More ships meant more men, and
those could be got. He commented upon
the important personnel, which he said
was due to the enormous complexity of
modern warships. Nevertheless the Ad
miralty would have no difficulty in glean
ing from a long roll of candidates. The
Government proposed an increase of Â£850,
--000 for guns and docks at Gibraltar. It
had decided to build three docks instead
of one. The cost of the new works was
estimated at Â£2,500,000, in addition to the
Â£361,000 already allotted for the new dock
there.
Summing up the demands of the Gov
ernment, Mr. Goschen said .it was pro
posed to raise the naval works bill from
the Â£8,500.000 proposed by the last Govern
ment to Â£14,000,000, which would be the
amount of the Government bill. [Cheers
and cries of "Oh! oh!"]
Continuing he said that these might
seem large figures, but the Chancellor of
the Exchequer authorized him to state
that the exchequer could . supply, the
money. It was proposed to add to the
navy five battle-ships like the improved
Renown, four first-class cruisers, three sec
ond-class cruisers, six third-class cruisers
and twenty-eight torpedo-boat destroyers.
The total estimates . were Â£21,822,000,
against Â£18,701,000 for 1895-96. The Minis
ters believed they had arrived at a point
on which they must stand. If any tremen
dous strain came upon the country
obliging Great Britain to bear the whole
burden alone and unaided, or whether in
the event of any general disturbance she
would take her place with any other
power, the British fleet would represent
the self - reliance of a great nation.
[Cheers.] This was the Ministers'unani
mous opinion. - On that unanimity they,
commended the estimates to the House,
confident that the cost would be cheerfully
borne and trusting that they would be re
ceivea, as they were conceived, in a spirit
of moderation.

Anti-Semites Control.
VIENNA, Austria, March 2.â The sec
ond day's balloting for members of the

DEATH FOLLOWED A PRAYER.
She Had Tested the Revolver and
Then Sent a Bullet Through '
Her Heart.
TACOMA, Wash., March The long
search for Mrs. Grace Goodrich Cody, the
wife of Attorney Arthur B. Cody of Chi
cago, is at an end. To-day her blackened
body was found on a bluff near the bay.
A bullet wound over her heart and a re
volver clasped in her right hand told the
story of the poor woman's death.
P. H. Goodrich, Mrs. Cody's father,
made the ghastly discovery. For the past
two months he has been relentless in the
search for his daughter, and this morn
ing, accompanied by A. R. Upright, he
started to explore a point that had not be-
THE LATE MRS. GRACE GOODRICH CODY.
[From a photograph taken a few days before she disappeared.]
fore been visited. Opposite the foot of
Ninth street, between Cliff avenue and the
sidetracks along the water front, the two
came upon a shawl, a cape and a glove.
Goodrich was in the lead, and Upright,
who wa3 some distance away, heard the
old man cry out in agony. Rushing up,
he found Goodrich clasping the articles to
his breast and prone on the ground in a
; faint. Upright continued on and found
the body. Then, returning, he revived
the father.
"Is my daughter there?" Goodrich
asked.
"Yes; her body is," was the reply.
"Is she dead?"
"Yes."
"Suicide?"
"Yes; she shot herself."
The grief of the aged man was awful to
contemplate. His face took en a deathly
hue; he reeled, staggered and then fell in
a second faint. Again he was revived and
Upright led him away, not allowing him
to gaze upon the woman's corpse.'
Assistance was summoned and Upright
led a party back to the spot where Mrs.
Cody had ended her life. Undertaker Hos
ka was one of the number, and he went pre
pared to remove the corpse from the
thicket in which it had reposed since the
tragedy two months ago.
The sight of the dead is always appall
ing, and carries with it a thrill of horror.
It is not to be wondered at that strong
men, who had not known the beautiful
woman in life, shed tears over this black
ened clay. It was lying face downward,
with the knees drawn up. Evidently the
woman had been in the attitude of prayer
when she sent a bullet into her heart. In
the right hand was the revolver with which
she had ended her life. Her aim had been
true, and death must have been instan
taneous. A bruise above the ear on the
right side of the head had been caused
by contact with a .*, rock when she fell.
The face, which rested on the ground,
was badly decomposed. The clothing was
the same Mrs. Cody wore the last day she
was seen alive, and the exposure to the
elements had not faded it. The clasped
revolver was of the cheap American bull
dog pattern and contained two cartridges
and three empty shells. It was stained
with blood and very rusty. It is believed
that she discharged the weapon twice to
test it or to. learn how to hold it steadily
before turning it upon herself.
It is singular that the body of the suicide
had not been discovered before. It lay
near a path traversed by hundreds of
workingmen daily, and it was believed
that the scores of men who sought the rich
rewards offered by the husband and the
father of Mrs. Cody had gone over every
square foot of ground within , a radius of
ten miles from the city. Thousands of
dollars had been expended in the search,
two special trains having been employed
at one time. - Every strange woman , who
was reported to have borne the slightest
resemblance to the Chicagoan's wife was
looked up and: the search had . gradually
extended to California. Cody, is now in
â that State, and messages have been'; sent
to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Pasadena
and other towns he might visit to inter
cept him. Upon his arrival here the body
of his wife will be shipped to ; Naperville,
HI., her former home, and there interred.
Mrs. , Cody was a â  beautiful j woman, 28
years of age, and had every comfort of life
at her command. " : The illness, .which â  sub
sequently unbalanced her reason without
a warning to her relatives, is said to have
been caused by excessive bicycling. She
was an accomplished wheelwoman, and
took long trips daily. ' Last November she
became ill, and a Chicago physician warned
her never to mount a wheel again, and
recommended a trip to; the coast for a
change of mate. She came to Tacoma
and was seemingly recovering, when sud
denly her mind became deranged. She
left the home of her father, Mr. Goodrich,
on December 29, and was never heard from
again until the , startling discovery of to
day was made. .
Mrs. Cody's two children, a charming
little miss of eight and a precocious boy
several years younger, re visiting ; at the
heme of their grandfather, Judge H. H.
Cody of Pasadena. They have been kept
in ignorance of their mother's strange dis
appearance, and were dwelling in daily an
ticipation of seeing her at the home of her
father-in-law. â â -â â â '/
PORTLAND VERDICT SET ASIDE.
Supreme Court Reverses Judgment in the
Case of Lawyer Sleeves, Convicted
of Manslaughter.
PORTLAND, Or., March 2. â The Su
preme Court to-day reversed judgment in
the case of Lawyer X. N. Steeves, who â¢ six
months ago. was convicted of manslaugh
ter. The reversal of the judgment as well
as the long time consumed by the court in
reaching its conclusions are surprising
features.
Steeves was arrested in the latter part of
September, 1894, with "Bunko" Kelly,
charged with the murder of <j. W. Sayres.
Kelly is now serving a life sentence, while
Steeves, who is out on bonds, has prac
ticed in the minor courts since his con
viction. Steeves had acted as attorney for
George W. Allen, with whom Sayres was
in litigation for a large sum of money.
The prosecution alleged that Steeves hired
Kelly, then a notorious and unscrupulous
sailor boarding-housekeeper, to put Sayres
out of the way until the suit was disposed
of. In executing the alleged commission,
Kelly found it necessary to kill Sayres,
knocking him over the head and throwing
him into the river one dark night. A few
days later the body was found in the
stream.
Allen died a few weeks ago from a dose
of poison, self-administered. The only per-
. son now alive who could convict or place
; Steeves before the public as an innocent
| man is Kelly, and he will say neither yes
j nor no, though he is now dying from con
: sumption. District Attorney Hume will
I fix an early day for Steeves' next trial.
FRESNO WATCHMAN TALKS
Ex-Senator Goucher's Reply to
Statements Made by the
Governor.
â
Question of Veracity Between Mr.
Budd and Another Prominent
Democrat.
FRESNO, Cal., March 2.â Ex-Senator
Goucher's Watchman to-day published a
recent interview with . Governor Budd,
contained in a message to The Call a few
| days ago from Stockton, and in which this
sentence occured: "I have never had any
talk with Daggett in regard to White's
successor.". In reply to this and other
statements of the Governor, Goucher
says :
"The only thing in the world we based
our statement on was not Daggett's words
to the Governor at ail. We never heard of
them before. What we said two weeks
ago was, in substance, what a prominent
Democrat of San . Francisco had told us
about a year ago. He is a man who was
in Budd's fight I for Governor, and pro
fessed to know what he was talking about.
This was the gist of the Watchman's state
ment, re-enforced somewhat by the aver
ment that Budd and Daggett have -since
then been appointing each other's friends
to places.
, "In view of the Governor's denial, it is
now merely a question of veracity, mem
ory or confidence between- the Governor,
and the prominent Democrat who was our
informant. Such compacts are usually
hedged in so that men's tongues are tied,
but perhaps the Governor's attitude may
have been wrongly understood by our in
formant. ;
: "It is perfectly legitimate for either Budd
or Daggett to; aspire to the senatorship
and to put- fences wherever they
think they, will do the most good. We
want a ! Democratic | Senator,' anyhow, but
White is most likely to succeed himself."

YOUNG AMERICA DELIGHTED.
Battles With Snowballs the Order of
the Dayâ Some Damage to the
Fruit.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 2.â The
severe frosts of the last two nights have, it
is believed; done considerable damage to
the fruit interests in this locality.'
Out on the plain lands to the south and
east of the city, it is reported, the apricot
crop suffered greatly, the warm weather of
the' past two weeks having caused the
fruit to mature too rapidly.
The blossoms of the peach, plum, almond
and cherry trees in some localities have a
withered appearance, and are probably
badly damaged, if not entirely destroyed.
Along the American River district there
are indications that the fruit, with the sin
gle exception of the apple crop, has suf
fered materially. In the Sacramento River
districts it is stated that while ice formed
on last Sunday morning, no damage is as
yet apparent to the fruit crops.
Dealers are closing contracts at fair
prices owing to expected scarcity of the
coming- crop.
VACAVILLE'S OUTLOOK
Some Damage May Have Resulted From
the Storm.
VACAVILLE, Cat.., March 2. â Resi
dents of Vacaville and vicinity awoke this
morning to gaze upon a scene unusual to
the inhabitants of California's earliest fruit
district. The hard-beating rain which had
prevailed during the greater part of last
night had given way to feathery flakes,
which for almost an hour came down
thickly enough to suit even a denizen of
the blizzard-swept East. The scene was
one of beauty, the more charming because
of its novelty. Children were in high glee
in the delightful anticipation of such rare
sport as snowballing, but the older faces
assumed a serious aspect at thoughts of
the possible damage to fruit. In a few
nours all traces of the storm had vanished
in the town and immediate vicinity, only
the white summits of the surrounding
hills being left as a reminder of what had
been ;V but further up the valley and
through Pleasant -Valley the snow was
still falling, and, it is said, there is about
four inches on the ground. '..
.Varied are the opinions expressed as to
the effect of this storm on the fruit crops.
Up to date; the outlook had never before
been brighter for an immense yield, but
this storm corresponds closely to the front
of a year ago, which blighted the apricot
blooms. The unusually warm speil of the
past few weeks had greatly developed the
early fruits, making them the more sus*
ceptible to the extreme changes. The
slight frost of two nights ago caused many
early tomatoe vines to blacken, and this
cold can but increase the damage done to
early vegetables. Some orchardists have
reported that their apricots were dropping,
while others say that they can well afford
to have two-thirds of their fruit killed,
thus saying the expense of thinning.
These latter, however, are exceptional
cases, and all are anxiously awaiting the
the change of the weather. Should warm
sunshine succeed this storm the damage
will be but slight. *
CHICO ANS FIGHT WITH SNOW.
Truckee's Ice Carnival Rivaled in the
Butte County Burg.
CHICO, Cal., March 2.â Not since Jan
uary, 1888, has Chico been visited by such
a fall of snow as occurred to-day. It be
gan coming down shortly after 6 o'clock
this morning, and in a few hours the
ground was covered to a depth of six inches.
The city would have rivaled Truckee dur
ing the. heighth of the ice carnival. Snow
balling was the order of the day, and it
was as much as one's life i was worth to
venture near an organized mob of the
snowballers. The long-haired' Chinaman,
with unusual foresight, kept within doors.
At the public schools hundred of boys and
girls who had never seen a snowstorm be
fore went wild with joy, and even the
teachers took part in the sport. , -
The mountain roads that were passable
heretofore are now blocked, and the mills,
which were expected to open shortly, will
be closed for some time. There is con
siderable . speculation as to what damage
the : storm will cause to fruit. Unless a
freeze follows little damage â¢if any will
result. As to grain and vegetation the
snow * will benefit it. Rain was needed,
and the present storm will give the water
a chance to soak into the ground. Re
ports from Marysville, Oroville, Red Bluff,
Redding and other neighboring towns in
dicate that the storm was general.
NAPA SCHOOLS CLOSED.
Young America Celebrates the Coming of

NAPA, Cal., March Napa people
were surprised this morning on awaken

and the feathery flakes still falling.
* During the storm, which lasted about
four hours, about four inches of snow
fell. This was the -first in Napa since
1883, and Napaites enjoyed the novelty.
The public schools closed for a half
holiday to let young America celebrate the
occasion, which he did in a most energetic
manner, breaking several large store
windows and innumerable smaller ones
with snowballs.
Every one- who walked the streets suf
fered *.. from v indiscriminate snowballing,

to the scene, bringing up to many minds
thoughts of tne old home "down East."
The : * heavy . snow in . the mountains will
work a hardship on stock, especially young
lambs. The sun shone warm and bright
this afternoon, and as the weather is mod
erating: it is not probable that fruit will
suffer much.

RAIL DISASTER
AT STOCKTON
A Switch Engine Crashes
Into a Freight on a
Siding.
TRAINMEN PINNEDDOWN
Two Are so Badly Maimed That
Their Recovery Is Not
Probable. -
CAUGHT BY HEAVY TIMBERS.
The Strength of Several Teams of
Horses Not Sufficient to Extri
cate Them.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 2.â A disas
trous collision which resulted in serious
injury to three men, two of whom will
probably die, occurred this morning
shortly after 8 o'clock in front of the
Southern Pacific passenger depot and in
sight of a hundred spectators. Train No.
107, a regular freight bound for Sacra
mento, was on a sidetrack ready to start
for the capital city, when the switch engine
came along on the main line at full speed.
In an instant the engine dashed through
the open switch and crashed into the
freight with a report that was heard blocks
away.
Bert Bonney, the engineer on the switch
engine, saw what was coming and tried to
reverse his engine, but it was too late.
He remained in his cab and received only
slight injuries.
George H. James, the fireman, and
Harry Vizelich, a brakemen, who were in
the cab of the switch engine, tried toes
cape, but only reached the step of the cab,
when the tender caught them and pinned
then between the heavy timbers.
Every effort to extricate the injured
trainmen was without avail for nearly a
half-hour. Attempts to pull the tender
from the cab were unavailing. Several
teams of horses were hitched to the tender
but could not move it. Then an engine
was sent from the roundhouse and at
tached to the tender with heavy chains,
but the chains snapped and it was seen
that the men would have to be extricated
by other methods. An attempt was made
to saw off the side of the cab against which
James was resting, and soon the saw struck
iron rods. Then a heavy plank was se
cured to pry off the side of the cab.
By this time thousands had gathered to
watch the operation of the releasing of
the pinioned trainmen. Finally the side
of the cab was pried off and James re
leased. The crowd cheered as he was
pulled from between the cab and the
tender. The fireman was gritty to the
last. He never groaned but once, when
the. chains snapped letting the tender
back closer on him.
All this time Vizelich was.being crushed
between the cab and tender at the other
side. Attempts to pry them apart were
unsuccessful at first, but finally, after
working a half hour, he was released.
Like James, he never murmured.
He was carried to his home near
the railway; track, where it was
found that his right leg was broken four
inches above the knee, the flesh of the
right knee crushed to a jelly and the flesh
of the right thigh pinched off the bones.
He is probably injured internally as well.
James is even more seriously hurt.
His right leg is broken in three places
once two and' a half inches above the
knee, again three inches higher and again
between that and the upper thigh. He is
also injured internally. Amputation will
probably follow in the cases of both men
and they will probably die.
Engineer Charles W. Pool of train No.
107 was knocked senseless, and his head
lacerated.
James lives at 1813 "Williams street,
Oakland. Vizelich is a Stockton boy.
Pool lives at Sacramento,
The engines were smashed and battered
and late this afternoon were hauled to
Sacramento for repairs. The responsibil
ity for the accident has not yet been fixed.
It will fall, however, on the trainmen, who,
according to the railroad regulations,
should have closed the switch.

KICKED OFF A TANDEM.
A Cycler Dies From Injuries Inflicted
by. a Fractious Horse.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 2.â Charles
Hussey, a 15-year-old boy, died in this city
to-day as the result of the kick of a horse..
He and Adolph Reddick, son of ex-
Governor Reddick, started from this city
last Sunday afternoon for a trip to Palo
Alto on a tandem bicycle.
When they reached Santa Clara they
were riding behind a colt that was '. being
led. The cyclers tried to uass. and the
colt wheeled and kicked the machine.
It was at first supposed that the riders
were not much injured. Reddick'had one
lee considerably bruised and it took seven
stitches to sew up a cut in Hussey's arm.
The latter complained of an injury to his
head when he reached home, but nothing
serious was apprehended, and on the fol
lowing day he was able to be out again.
This afternoon he was also walking
about, but suddenly- he again complained
of his head and Jay down as if to take a
rest. Soon he was observed to be motion
less, and it was supposed that he was
asleep.
Investigation proved, however, that he
was dead. An autopsy was held this even
ing, and it was found that there had been
a concussion of the brain. A blood vessel
had burst and death resulted from
hemorrhages.

LOST ON MT. TAMALPAIS
Thrilling Experience of a Young
Man on a Sight-Seeing
- Expedition.
Over Twenty-Four Hours in the Bit
ter Cold Without a Taste
of Food.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 2.âHein
rich K. Hansen, a young man, 22 years of
age, a native of Denmark, left this place
Saturday morning upon a donkey for the
purpose of climbing to the summit of
Mount Tamalpais. Sunday afternoon he
returned, almost starved and covered with
dirt. He had lost his way upon the moun
tain and for over twenty-four hours had
been without food. He tells a thrilling
story of his experience upon the slopes of
Tamalpais.
About four days ago Hansen was sent to
Mill Valley by Captain Staples of the Sail,
ors' Home in San Francisco, where he had
been stopping, to do some work for a con
tractor at this place. . Being dissatisfied
! with the pay, young Hansen resolved to
put in his time by viewing the country
about Mill Valley from the back of a don
key. He hired an animal from Fred
Schluter and left for the top of the moun
tain, with the intention of returning by
the other side. His experience is best told
by himself:
"I left Mill Valley to go up the mountain
and get back in time for dinner. The don
key caused me a great deal of trouble. He
did not want to go at all, and tried many
times to lie down. "When I got near the
top of the mountain the wind was very
strong and blew me over. I could not
keep my feet, and I started to come back
on the other side. I kept riding on and
on but I soon lost myself, and it was get
ting late. The sun went down and it grew
bitter cold. The donkey was tired and did
not want to move, but I kept on, and at
lastâ it must have been about 9 o'clockâ l
came to a house such as might nave been
built for the use of pedestrians.
"It was growing very much colder, and
I took the saddle and blanket off of the
donkey and turned it loose to get its din
ner. I had plenty of water to drink but
nothing to eat, and I was awful hungry.
"I got some wood and built a fire on the
floor of the little house: and rolled up in
the blankets to go to sleep, when suddenly
I noticed the sides of the house had caught
tire. I got up and worked hard and at last
put the flames out and got a little sleep.
In the morning when I woke up 1 found
the smote had made my face black.. The
donkey had gone away. Taking the blan
ket and saddle F started with the dog I
had taken along with .me to â  find the ani
mal. The dog got on the trail and we
found the donkey on a hill live miles
away. After I had; saddled it we started
out again and got caught in the chaparral,
and it .was three hours before I found the
way out. I let the dog lead the way, and
we got back to Mill Valley at last."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 1896.
STOCKTON'S NEW
WATER FRONTAGE
A Four Thousand Foot Tidal
Canal Is Now Being
Built.
BIG WORK OF THE AJAX
Prospects for the Location of a
Beet-Sugar Factory on
the Channel.
GIVES CHEAP TBANSPORTAION.
Extension From Mormon Channel to the
Material Yards of the San Joa
quin Valley Railroad.
STOCKTON, Cal., March 2.â Division
Superintendent McFarland, P. A. Buell
and several other officials, of. the Ban
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
way recently paid a visit of inspection to
Stockton's new water front and witnessed
the gigantic work of the bucket dredge
Ajax. -
There are a good many people in Stock
ton who do not know that this wonderful
Ajax machine is working daily to increase
the water frontage of this city by fully
8000 feet. The work has been going on
very quietly now for about four months,
and the ; big channel or estuary is more
than. half completed. At present those
who know of its existence call it the
Boggs-Buell railroad canal, but a shorter,
not to fay more euphonious, title for the
famous canal is recognized as one of the
crying needs of the hour.
Since the Valley Railroad came to Stock
ton this is one of the biggest and most ben
eficial undertakings that has been set on
foot in this city. The cut is at almost
right angles with and from Mormon Chan
nel, and extends for a distance of 4000 feet.
It is 80 feet in width and will have a depth
of 20 feet, which is ample for the unload
ing of barges, schooners and even the
steamers that come up from the bay
through the San Joaquin and Stockton
rivers. On one side of the new channel
the land is owned by the Colusa State Sen
ator, John Bo_gs, and on the other side
the P. A. Bnell lumber-yard and the
material yards of the Valley Railroad hold
the titles.
The cutting of this channel will be of
the utmost benefit to the Valley Railroad,
as it will permit all the material for the
construction of the road to be hauled from
San Francisco Bay in barges to the ma
terial yards, and there loaded from the
barges to the construction trains, which
will run on the borders of the channel. :
Water frontage is a very limited quan
tity in Stockton at present, and for this
reason the new cut will be of inestimable
benefit not only to those immediately
inteiested in the enterprise, .but to the
entire city and even . the surrounding
farmers as well.. It is expected that Sena
tor Boggs will build grain warehouses on
his land that adjoins the channel, and if
this be done it is easy to see what ad
vantageous facilities will thus be afforded
the shippers. In fact, all class of shippers
or importers will be directly benefited by
the canal, Stockton's bright commercial
future considerably hastened and her
present business prosperity much height
ened...
The work is all contracted for and more
than half completed. Already over 100,000
cubic yards of earth have been excavated,
and within three months the remainder
will be taken out. The estimated cost is
$50,000.
One of the big projects on foot in con
nection with this canal is the erection of a
beet sugar factory on the borders of the
tidal cut. This- is considered something
more than a possibility and an almost cer
tainty, since Claus Spreckels has several
limes expressed himself as favorable to
such an enterprise.
San Joaquin County farmers are plant
ing sugar beets in large acreages at present,
and it is thought that the required number
of acres for the support of a sugar factory
will be planted before the end of this year.
San Joaquin soil, particularly that in the
region immediately adjoining this city, is
peculiarly adapted to sugar beet culture,
as several practical experiments have al
ready shown. .

SACRAMENTO VALLEY CANAL.
Land-Owners Assembled at Knights Land-
ing Consider a Reclamation
Project.
WOODLAND, Cal., March 2. â There
was a large . attendance of land-owners of
Reclamation District No. 108 at a meeting
held at Knights Landing to-day. T. F.
Hughes presided and T. H. Sullinger offi
ciated as secretary. At a meeting held at
Grimes Landing" on May 18, 1895, a com
mittee had been appointed to inquire into
the matter of reclamation. To-day the re
port of the committee was called for and
read. It.was as follows:
To the Land-Owners of Reclamation District
No. 108â Gentlemen: We, your committee ap
pointed at a' land-owners' meeting held at
Grimes Landing on May 18, 1895, to inquire
into the matter of reclamation, beg to report
as follows: We find that | our district, compris
ing some 74,000 acres, was, when it was organ
ized, subject to inundation during the rainy
season, and acain when the snow melted in
the spring. These inundations rendered the
lands of the district valueless for the purpose
of agriculture. Large sums of money have
been expended in the construction and repair
of levees along the banks of the Sacramento
River. As a result of these levees, a portion of
the lands of the district are in a measure re
claimed.
Out. of 74,000 acres only about 6 8,000 acres
are taxed for reclamation purposes, leaving
about 6000 acres untaxed. And these same
lands are exempted and generally protected
by the present system. Lands that have been
under water seven times in the last eight
years are taxed the same per acre as lands
that have grown six or seven crops of grain in
the same time. This mode of taxation has
been practiced for many years, and those who
had the burden to carry generally submitted
without a murmur, but now we hear murmurs
of discontent. Many complain of being tired
of this way of doing. We believe, unless there
be an effort made to protect, the district will
be involved In serious trouble, possibly re
sulting in the abandonment of reclamation
entirely and disincorporation.
The only remedy that we can suggest Is a
West Side intercepting canal of sufficient
capacity to take the water from the north and
west and carry it past our district. We ear
nestly recommend that wo proceed to con
struct such a canal without unnecessary delay
and push the same to completion as rapidly as
possible. T. F. Hl-ghes,
Tuomas J. MUMMA,
W. 11. West.
Other members of the committee not
present were Hon. D. N. Hersney and
James Baldson. The committee is com
posed of President Browning, Trustees T.
J. Munna and J. D. Brown, secretary and
treasurer of the San Francisco Safe De
posit Company, and Albert Miller, presi
dent of the San Francisco Savings and
Loan Society.
A recess was taken for lunch. At the
afternoon session a general discussion took
place, but no further business was trans
acted.
JONES TRIAL AT CARSON
The Alleged Accomplice of James
Heney Arraigned in
Court.
Ten Jurors Secured Before the First
Venire of Talesmen Is
Exhausted.
CARSON, Nev., March 2.â The trial of
John T. Jones opened here to-day. Jones
was indicted with James Heney for rob
bing the Carson mint of $23,000. Heney
| was convicted two months ago and is serv
ing an eight-y ear sentence in the Nevada*
l State prison. Jones was the assistant
I melter and refiner under the Republican
j administration, and is a prominent man in
! this community. He is a member of most
| of the secret societies in Carson, and he
j and his friends will make a stubborn fight
| for his acquittal. " ;" ~, :
John T. Jones' has protested his inno
-1 cence ever since the beginning of the trial,
; and to-day he wore a confident smile as he
t entered the United States District Court
; room. When tbe doors opened the same
â  spectators who had sat throughout the
i Heney trial filed in and took their accus
tomed seats. John Dennis of Battle
Mountain has been added to the Jones
forces, and was beside the defendant when
the case was called, together with Attor
neys Woodburn and Coffin. The Govern
ment was represented, as before, by United
I States Attorney Jones and General R. M.
Clarke.
The work of securing jurors began at
once, but there was not the lively fight
over the talesmen . as in the Heney trial.
Both sides seemed ready to get down to
business, and the following were selected
before the noon recess: C. H. Lawson, J.
L. McFarland, George A.Wilcox-, Harrison
Berry, J. P. Whitcomb, D. L. Morton, W.
D. Elliott, B. C. Bly the, Walter Morton
and John Hamm. A man from Washoe
raised a laugh when asked if he thought
the Heney case affected the Jones case by
saying! "he supposed they were in to
gether."
At noon two jurors were still needed and
the venire was exhausted. The United
States Marshal was asked to secure twelve
more men and have them ready by 10
o'clock to-morrow morning. The ten men
accepted were placed in the custody of a
deputy, who was ordered , to keep them in
sight and prevent any one talking with
them.

morning. Ten cars and the engine ran off
the track, but no one injured. ,
The westbound passenger is held at
Floriston to await the clearing of the

Reclamation ' District against â¢ a large
number of property-owners in the district
to determine the "legality of an assess
ment of $18,000, made this year for im
provements in dams and breakwaters to

ing this tax, and this led 'to tbe present
litigation. .- "
REGRETS THE INSULT
Continued from First â  Page
Southern Railway 12 points. There was
also a material decline . in Cuban deben
tures. Notwithstanding the steady fall in
prices since the receipt of the news of the
action of the American Senate this market
has shown no sign of panic.
Senor Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish Min
ister at Washington, cables that the Amer
ican Government objects to the formal
remonstrance he-was instructed to make
against the insults offered to Spain in the
speeches delivered in the Senate during
the discussion of the Cuban belligerency
resolution. The Minister says that the
Senate is an irresponsible body and that
the Government depends upon the Presi
dent, who does not influence the cham
bers. â â¢â .'" "â¢ 'â¢ '
A crowd of the residents of Bilboa tO-day

the American Consulate in that city. Sev
eral honorary. American Consuls have re
signed as a protest against the action of

The Government has secured in Ger

QUITE NATURAL AND CORRECT.
German Papers Uphold the Indignation
of the Spanish.
BERLIN, Germany, March 2.â The
North German Gazette commenting upon
the demonstration in Barcelona yesterday
says that Spain's indignation and excite
ment is quite natural and correct. Nobody
in the meantime, however, heed look upon
the reported increased armament of Spain
as tragic. Still if President Cleveland
should follow up the Senate's request and
recognize the Cuban rebels as belligerents
before the negotiations between Washing
ton: and Madrid upon the subject are
ended then the negotiations ought to be
terminated.
The Frankfort Zeitung asserts that
secret negotiations are proceeding between
France and Spain with the object on the
part of Spain of procuring the interven
tion of France against the United States.
The Lokal Anzeiger says that the action
of the United States Senate in regard to
Cuba has resulted naturally in an explo
sion of Spanish national indignation on
the part of the Government and the people
in defense of the Spanish flag in Cuba to
the last extremity.
The Leipsiger Nachrichten says that
America may be right from the American
and Monroe point of view, but her course
is not based upon any policy other than
the American National one. , Â
The Lokal Anzeiger, the Post and the
Berliner Neuste Nachrichten express the
opinion that the vote on the , Cuban revo
lution in the United States Senate ought
to have, for Spain the immediate blissful
consequence of the nation being aroused
to vindicate its existence 'to show that it
is not dead instead of wasting its powers
in party squabbles.
Germania expresses the hope that the
United States will recognize the 'fact that
Spanish excitement is justified and treat it
with coolness and calmness.
The ? Boersen ! Courier says that ; the
United States* 1 ' Government is driving
toward a r conflict with Spain. This and
other agitations give proof that a militia
system is no measure of safety against the
warlike tendencies which are supposed to
be possessed chiefly by countries requiring
compulsory and universal military duty.
The Reichsbote declares that no Spanish
Government can give . up Cuba. â¢ The
United States, the paper thinks, has made
a gross attack upon Spain, which will
create a most serious conflict unless the
American Government tries to avoid going
to extremes.
ARE FLEEING TO HAVANA.
Inhabitants Afraid of the Troops Sent
by Spain.
HAVANA, Cuba. Feb. 29 (via Tampa,
Fia., March 2.)â lnhabitants of Punta
Brava, Guatao and other towns west "i of
Mariano, and under the jurisdiction of the
volunteers '; and soldiers â¢ stationed at the
latter place, are fleeing to Havana in ter
ror. .They say they have less fear of the
insurgents than of the troops. Twenty
two women from Guatao, wives and
mothers of the men slain there on the 22d,\
or made prisoners at that time, are in this
city. They called at the palace to
see General Weyler and beg for the free
dom of the men now. in Morro Castle, as
well as to tell of ; the outrages committed
by Captain Calvo and the men sent out by
the Marquis de Cervera. Their visit to the
palace was on the same day that ; the cap
tain-general ' received a delegation of wo
men, who were attired in gay costumes
and wore the yellow and -red. colors of
Spain on their breasts. They had been
throwing flowers, bonbons and love pigeons
to the newly arrived troops and shouting
"viva Espana" until their voices were
gone. General Weyler received them and
thanked them for their demonstrations of
loyalty. . They cheered him and departed.
. Then came the poor women of Guatao.
They were nearly all white women, chil
dren clung to their skirts and two babes
.were carried in arms. Instead of gay col
ors most of them were in mourning. *
One of General Weyler's aids talked with
the one man who accompanied them and
told him that the general would not re
ceive them. They left the palace sad at
heart and are still in the city.
American residents of Havana, who are
well informed, claim that Consul-General
Williams' reports to the State Department
have not given â  the administration cor
rect view .of * the ' situation ] in Cuba.
Williams has been in Havana so
long and in such close touch . with
f the officials at the ; palace.it is claimed,
that his views are colored by Spanish rep
resentations and also by merchants, com
mission men and others whose personal
interests will be served by' the" putting
down of the revolution .by Spain. Wil
liams cannot be accused of inattention
to duty. He is in his office from morning,
to night, but â  this close application to
duties of minor importance may have pre
vented his fully realizing the state of af
fairs on the island. Williams is also well
advanced in years and dislikes incidents
which mar the quiet routine of office work.
His attitude has not ; satisfied all of the
American colony, and a petition is now in
circulation, asking the Government for his
recall. '
On top of this comes the rumor that
"Williams has sent his resignation to Wash
ington. Mr. Springer, the Vice-Consul,
has been in the office over ten years, and
is thoroughly familiar with its workings.
Under ordinary circumstances he would
be the most fitting successor if Williams
is to go, but in view of the semi-diplomatic
position of the Consul-General and the dif
ficulties likely to arise in the near future,
the wisest course would seem to be that a
man of diplomatic experience and strong
executive ability be sent from "Washington.
The situation has reached an import
ance, and the danger of strained relations
with the United States is so great, that a
man broad enough in mind to realize the
gravity of the situation should represent
the United States here.
Gomez and Maceo are now in the east
ern part of Matanzas province. They are
taking their wounded to a place of safety,
and going where their horses can rest and
graze and their men rest after their fa
tiguing campaign. As they have left in
Havana province many bands of from fifty
to TOO men each and other bands to operate
in Pinar del Rio, Matanzas and other
provinces as before, it can hardly be said
that the two principal leaders of the
rebellion are fleeing from or before
the Spanish armies. Gomez has dis
played wonderful ability as a leader and
his present move is said to be part of a
plan arranged before he left Santa Clara
for , his march to the West.* The. with
drawal from Havana province of tbe main
armies of Gomez and Maceo will make it
more difficult for General Weyler to deal
them an effective blow before the setting
in of the rainy season. There are rumors
here of the landing of an expedition in
Pinar del Rio. It is supposed to have been
sent from the States by Collazo.
IO INTERCEPT TWO SCHOONERS.
Revenue Cutters in Florida Waters Seek-
ing Filibusters.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2.â The
Treasury Department to-day â¢ sent in
structions to the commanders of rev
enue cutters in Florida waters .'di
recting them to use every effort to inter
cept an alleged filibustering expedition
bound for Cuba, which the Spanish au
thorities have reported to the State De
partment as about to leave Alligator Key,
between Key West and Tampa. The re
port says that two schooners, one from
Tampa bearing' Collazo and eighty men,
and the other from a point north of
Tampa, laden with arms and ammuni
tion, left port last night for Alligator Key,
where they are to meet the steamer Three
Friends, recently cleared from Jackson
ville. At the rendezvous the men and
arms are to be transferred to the steamer,
which will at once sail for the northeast
coast of Cuba. â¢ " :" : ;77- : 77
Under the law it will not be possible for
the treasury officers to seize either of the
schooners as long as they remain apart,
but if they join the steamer in American
waters, as is contemplated, the case will
be similar to that of the Bermuda and
Horsa. ' I: *
ColJazo, who heads the expedition, was
a commander in the ten years' war. Pre
viously he had been partly educated at the
Royal Military Academy in Spain, but
failed to graduate. He has made several
attempts to take his company of about
eighty men to Cuba in the past year and
has been caught in every case, the last
time at Cape Sable, where the revenue
cutter Winona destroyed the camp which
his company had been occupying eight
weeks, waiting for a chance to sail. All
his men were arrested last summer for at
tempting to go to Cuba, but were released.
FILIBUSTERS MAY GO FREE.
Probability of the Release of the Ber
muda's Outfit.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 2.-The
Journal says this morning: The steamer
Bermuda, which was seized by the Fed
eral authorities a week ago on suspicion
that she was about to start for Cuba oh a
filibustering expedition, will be probably
restored to her owners. .
I The members of the Cuba Junta In this
city have received information from Wash
ington that not only will the steamer be
restored, but all, arms and ammunition
captured on the tug Stranahan will be re
leased,' and the J proceedings , against Gen
eral Calixto Garcia and the others arrested
on the Bermuda will be quashed.
The 'United States marshals who have
been guarding - the Bermuda were still on
board of her yesterday. One of them oaid
that he did not know when the ship would
be released, but that he was pretty certain
the marshals would not remain on board
more than a day or two longer.
Among the members of the Junta there
was little i inclination Ito talk about the

The Noted Woman Anarchist
Will Soon Lecture in
This City.
WAS A COMMUNARD LEADER.
At One Time She Went About Paris
Firing Houses in the Cause
of Anarchy.
Louise Michel, the famous French com
munard, is coming to San Francisco in the
course of the next two months to deliver
.â¢several lectures here on her peculiar social
views.
Louise, who has a world-wide though
unenviable notoriety, has frequently been
offered engagements to lecture in America.
Her friends, of whom Pietro Gori
is one of the most enthusiastic, states that
she is only coming to America now to
raise funds to build a home in London
for political refugees who have been exiled
from other countries for holding startling
and advanced views on social questions.
Louise Michel, the French revolutionary
leader, was born in Vroncourt in IS3O.
She was first brought into notice by her
poetical and musical talent, in which she
was encouraged by Victor Hugo.
In 1860 she opened a school in the Quar
tier Montmartre and there gave lessons in
music, and followed in that line until her i
revolutionary spirit was roused in the
days of the terrible Commune, in
1871. when the Blanquists, collectivists
and anarchists terrorized the metropolis \
of France, and she forsook her avocation
to take the part of leader of the commu
nards and petroleuses, who, torch in .hand, j
were ready to destroy that they might
thrive by pillage.
During a meeting of a crowd that was
favorable to the communistic doctrines on
the Esplanade dcs Invalides, Louise j
Michel appeared to address the meeting, !
she having been chosen as the orator of '.
the day, but before she had fairly started
her address the police concluded that her .
language was too anarchistic and forced
her to desist. The crowd that
looked upon her as a second Joan
d'Arc, who had come to save them,
made a move on the gendarmes \
â¢ive finding that useless moved on the resi- I
dence of President Grevy, but there were â 
driven back. A crowd followed Louise i
Michel along the boulevard, and on the â¢
way entered shops and asked for what
tbey wanted. If it was refused they took
it. The female leader did not take part in
the e matters, but laughed at the discom
fiture of the shopkeepers.
A second demonstration by the commu
nists was suppressed by the authorities
and a number of those who took part in
the proceedings were arrested and sent to
prison for short terms. Louise Michel i
surrendered herself to the authorities and !
she was placed on trial for inciting
to ' pillage. Before this . she had
teen in exile in New Caledonia, and had
returned with pardoned communar. She
was jointly charged with one Pougel, in
whose possession were found pamphlets,
some of which nad been sent to soldiers,
advising them to burn the barracks. The
two prisoners were found guilty, and
Louise was sent to prison for six years and
Pougel for eight years.
â¢ She was released before her term ex
pired, but her communistic spirit would
not down, for she took part in agitations
in 1886, and for this was sent to prison
again. She was again released and then
left France, and since has appeared at i
various places to promulgate the doctrines j
that are advanced here by Pietro Gori,
who is an intimate friend of hers.
She is now in the sixty-fifth year of .
her age and Gori declares that she still re
tains traces of her former beauty. He says
that she is a remarkably well preserved
woman whose light hair and light blue
. eyes make her very attractive.
"She has a sweet countenance," he said,
"and it is only her enemies who declare
that she is an old hag."
WANT A CAR SERVICE.
Ashbury Heights Property-Owners Dis
cuss the High-Handed and Illegal
Policy of Vining.
. The Ashbury Heights Improvement
Club met last night at 137 Carl street, with
George A. Rankin in the chair.
The committee of three on sidewalks on
â¢ Cole street was discharged and a commit
tee of five was appointed on sidewalks in j
. the whole district, a3 follows: F. W. M.
Lange, D. L. Westover, W. B. Walkup, E.
M. Fritz and R. D. Cranston. The chair
man reported that the suit against the
. railroad company for the forfeiture of the
Carl-street franchise was in the same stage
as at the last meeting of the club. The
court allowed thirty days' time, which
will expire March 30, and no further time
Will be granted except on a demurrer or
some other species of the "law's delay,"
and meanwhile the service on Carl street
continues a la Vining, which everybody
in San Francisco understands to mean
probably a little in the morning, less in
the evening and none at all by midday.
The committee went before the Super
visors when the franchise for bits of
streets, though in reality for the Metro-
Eolitan street road, was discussed. The
oard promised to consider the protest
from the property-owners in Ashbury
Heights, but immediately after took up
the matter and acted favorably toward the
railway people. The franchise as re
quested is for a line from Ellis and Market
to Mason. Then there is a jump to Hyde,
and the line continues from Ellis to O'Far
rell and. out to Scott, thence to Page to the
Park. The Carl-street branch, however, is
not considered. The application is so
worded that nobody except the Market
street Company can bid for the franchise.
The Hydrant Committee reported that
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department
promised to provide mains and fireplugs
throughout the district.
After the meeting adjourned there was
an informal talk about the streetcar lack
of service over the line on Carl street.
Mr. Vining's idea of economy is to run
cars there in the morning till 9:30 o'clock,
and then put them into tbe carhouse. At
5 p. M. be takes them out for exercise and
. gives them occasional runs over the road,
regardless of the legal contract made by
the railroad company with the representa
tives of .the people that cars shall run at
least every fifteen minutes. Suits at law
to compel the company to run every fif
teen minutes were suggested, and the pre
vailing sentiment ( was in favor of calling
the company to account in the courts.
MILK AND DISEASE.
An Interesting* Lecture Before the
Academy of Sciences â Valuable
Hints as to Tuberculous Cows.
At the meeting of the Academy of
â¢ Sciences last evening First Vice-President
Riiter presided, in the aDsence of Presi
dent David Starr Jordan.
Secretary Rixford announced that 575
â¢ specimens" bad been -contributed to the
herbarium and 195 to the museum.
A communication, signed by Professor
George Davidson, E. J. . ; Molera, . H. C.
Behr,' Herman - Kower, Marsden . Manson.
Thomas Price, L. A. Garnett and Professor
E. S.Holden^ announcing that it was the
desire of the writers to form asection
exact and applied science if "it met with
the approval of the council.
Tne chairman said that the council had
: given its approval and the gentlemen
could proceed to organize.
_, Dr. M. J. Roseman of the Marine Hos
pital service and stationed at the quaran
tine grounds on Angel Island delivered a
very interesting and instructive lecture on
"Bacteria and the Dairy."
He said that many ."kinds of microbes
that find their way into milk are harmless,
because human beings take them in
ternally and do not suffer any evil effects.
He explained that the harmful bacteria may
come from a cow having tuberculosis or
may come the use of impure water used in
washing cans. In one drop of water there
may be an uncountable number of the
microbes, each of which has the power to
multiply at the rate of 16.000,000 in
twenty- four hours. .
Dr. F. D. Wood lectured on tuberculosis
and cows. He told of the various ways in
which the cows contract this disease.
MUSIC BY COLLEGIANS.
State University Glee and Mandolin
Clubs at the Auditorium.
The glee and mandolin clubs of the State
University gave a highly successful con
cert at the Auditorium, corner of Eddy
and Jones streets, last night. There was a
large and appreciative audience present.
Several hundred seats were occupied by
members of the university notwithstand
the hardship of having to cross the ferry
"after tilling the soil all day," as one stu
dent referred to the campus improvement
work.
Every number on the programme re
sulted in an encore, and at one time three
responses were demanded by the enthusi
astic audience.
Following the opening "'Estudiantine"
by the two'clubs Fred S. Knight '98 sang
"The Quaker." The Glee Club effectively
rendered the sad story of "Little Tommy,"
following with "Willie Had a Purple Mon
key," and other part songs. Mrs. Olive
Reed sang a Norwegian song from Loge
most effectively. Her second programme
number was a lullaby, in which she was
assisted by the Glee Club and Charles C.
Parceils, the latter rendering a violin ob
ligato.
T_e Mandolin Club rendered several de
lightful selections, including Schrom
mel's "Vienna Forever" and "Recuerdos
de Espana" waltz.
Other popular participants were Power
Hutchins '00, Otto T. Wedemeyer '98 and
Charles E. Parceils. The latter played a
violin solo and met with a rousing encore. ;

SAN DIEGO MUD-SWEPT.
Fears for the Safety of Guano Schooners
at Sea.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 2. âThe
1 weather the past two days has been a sur
i prise to the proverbial oldest inhabitant.
The streets were full of dust all day, and
to-night the first rain for several weeks be
gan to fall in good volume, breaking the
! drought and insuring heavy crops.
The highest velocity of the wind last
night was twenty miles, and the same
velocity was reached to-night. This is
quite heavy for San Diego, and means that
a gale is raging outside. The roar of the
ocean is tremendous, and a big sea is run
ning. -_9_ffP~9P
Fears are entertained for the safety of
several small guano schooners, which are
due from the lower coast. Almost every
year at this time vessels are lost to the
southward.
The steamer Bonita sailed at 11 o'clock
this morning -with the disabled steamer
j Willamette Valley in tow, in spite of the i
! fact that a tremendous sea was encountered
j as soon as the bar was crossed the steamers
! stayed with it and passed around Point
' Loma on their dangerous trip up the coast.
j They have had the advantage all day of
favorable winds, and, with fore and" aft
sails spread, they will make good time
toward San Francisco.
No great damage has been caused yet by
the storm, though numerous small craft
have gone adrift on the bay and mixed
things a trifle.
FLAMES SWEEP OVER COLEVILLE
Complete Destruction of the Mono County
Village.
CARSON, Nev., March 2.â During a ter
rible wind and snow storm yesterday
Coleville, in Mono County, Cal., was de
stroyed by tire. Every building in the
town, except a blacksmith-shop and a de
serted dwelling, was wiped out. Coleville
was a small mountain town in the Ante
lope Valley, and was the center of supplies
for the ranchers and miners. It had re
cently been made a station for the Bod ie
and Bridgeport road. The loss by the
conflagration amounts to $50,000, with
only $10,000 insurance. .
The lire originated in the kitchen of the
Barnett Hotel, and the occupants barely
escaped with their lives. The hall and
store adjoining were burned before any
thing could be removed. Mr. Barnett, the
principal owner in the town, conducted a
livery stable, and the halters on the horses
had to be cut and the animals driven out
through the flames in order to save them.
In the entire town little was saved but
the clothes on the people's backs. Great
hardship has followed, as a severe snow
storm has been raging for the past twenty
four hours, and the snow has rendered the
roads almost impassable. Kirman &
Rickey, the "cattle kings," have a ranch
near by, and they have lent all the assist
ance possible.
The fire started between 3 and 4 o'clock
in the afternoon/and in less than half an
hour the village was in ashes. It is doubt
ful if the town will be rebuilt.
As there is no telegraphic connection
with the town but meager particulars
have been received, and the late severe
storm has cut off all travel by private con
veyance.
HAIL AT STOCKTON.
Fruit Trees in the Vicinity Stripped of
Their Blossoms.
STOCKTON, Cap.. March 2.â A terrible
hailstorm visited this section ** this after
noon and great damage has been done to
hte fruit crops and grain.
The storm came from the west, and con
tinued for about fifteen minutes. The
hailstones were large, and descended in
great quantities and with much force.
After the storm ceased the hail lay in
some places upon the ground two inches
thick.
In the orchards near the city, according
to reports, in outlying districts the blos
soms were knocked from the trees, and in
places where they were exposed to the full
fury of the storm the trees were literally
stripped. ':j_R_H
In the mountains in sight of the city on
the west there has been a heavy snowfall,
and the entire range is covered with a white
blanket.
Perris Mine Closed.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., March 2.â The Santa
Rosa mine at Perris shut down Saturday,
and the company filed a petition in insol
vency to-day. This action was precipi
tated by attachments '' put on the property
by the employes. -The mine is thought to
be one of the richest in Southern Califor
nia, but it is claimed that the company has
been shipping away all the; bullion mined
and paying as few bills as possible. .
Fires Burn in Stiisun Orchards.
SUISUN, Cal., March 2.â Snow, fell here
to-day and it is feared a killing frost will
result to-night. - Orchardists, however, are
prepared to smudge their .trees and j may
prevent much damage being done. Nearly
every orchardist in Suisun Valley will
start the fires during the night., 71
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 1896.
IN DREARY COOLGARDIE
G. R. Painter Tells of the Strange
Rush to the Wect Australia
Camp.
WATER HAULED ON TRAINS.
Men Go Prospecting With Camels In
stead of Horses or BurrosâCoro
mandel Mines.
G. R. Painter, a rich mine-owner of the
Coromandel Peninsula, New Zealand, is at
the Russ. :"
He has recently been at Coolgardie, West
Australia. He says that Coolgardie, while
a booming camp, has many serious draw
backs that people at a distance can scarcely
understand. So many men rushed in that
now there are more than are needed, and
lots of them are trying to get back home
but can't,' being out of money.
Then the country is so barren and deso
late that it may be considered the jump
ing-off place of the world. Huge camels
go to and fro, bearing freight and carrying
the outfits of the prospectors. A camel
for a miner is as indispensable as a burro
is for our miners in most sections of the
Sierra and Rocky Mountains. He says
that usually six prospectors will go
together on their ' trips and take two
camels. __f?__BHllÃgÃÃ_fi_B
The camels have succeeded horses al
most entirely, and horses are so rare that
they are scarcely to be seen. At the same
time camels are being raised there so as to
supply the continued demand as the coun
try develops. The scarcity of water is the
cause of the relegation of the horse and
the substitution oi the camel.
"Water is worth 8 cents a bucketful at
Coolgardie," said he, "and a good well is
as good as a gold mine. A year ago water
was worth 16 cents a bucketful. There are
a lot of big European companies operating
mines there, and they take their water in
by train loads.
"There are cars built on purpose to hold
water. It is brought from hundreds of
miles away across the desert. It is very
hot in that part of West Australia, and as
it is sandy, too, no animal is fitted for
habitation there like the camel. They can
eat the sagebrush, too, and other shrubs,
that horses can't. A camel there is worth
Â£70, or $350. - - '
"For all it is such an inhospitable coun
try gold is there in large quantities and
the railroads are being extended in every
direction. They are building miles every
day.
"My own mining property is on North
Island of the Coromandel Peninsula, N. Z.,
sixty miles northwest of Auckland. To
get there you go by steamer across the
Hauraki Gulf. There are some big quartz
mines there, the richest being; the Waihi,
an enormous property, which I came
within fifteen feet of striking myself, and
consequently I am a little sore about it.
The mine has 150 stamps working, and
the owners are putting up 150 more stamps.
The mine was discovered only a year ago.
Its dividends are enormous. I own the
! extension of the Waihi and extensions of
j some of the seven or eight other proper
i ties the Waihi group.
"There is an opportunity for California
â  to do a big business with New Zealand and
i Australia if it can manage to get the
, freight and passenger fares reduced a lit
tle. - We need mining machinery and
many other thin you have got here, but
we can get them for rather less from
! Europe than from here, though the dis-
I tance is far greater. ......
"This being the nearest place, and where
j we can get the best and in the shortest
I time, we would prefer to buy here. There
j is an important trade that may be got by
| California from the Antipodes if it will but
I reach out for it."
Mr. Painter says the Vrawera country,
about 100 miles from Auckland, held hith
erto exclusively by the blacks, is soon to
be opened up. He thinks it may prove as
rich as Coromandel or, possibly, Cool
gardie. .
ARIZONA'S PROTEST.
Citizens Deplore the Passage of the School
Lands Bill Oyer Mr. Cleve
land's Veto.
PHCENIX, Ariz., March 2.â Excitement
prevails in the Salt River Valley because
of the action of the lower house of Con
gress in passing the bill providing for the
leasing of school lands over the President's
veto.
They fear the Senate will do likewise.
The people were assured that the Presi
dent would veto the bill when it passed
Congress and confidently believed â  that
would be the end of it, but when the lower
house of Congress took the bill up and
passed it over Mr. Cleveland's head it
stirred up a hornets' nest.
The sentiment of a large majority of the
people of Arizona, regardless of party,
against this bill. They feel that the dan
ger of its passing the Senate is imminent.
Telegrams were sent to Senators known
by local citizens; petitions against the
passage of the bill were circulated; a meet
ing was called, and a general demonstra
tion made against the bill. The objec
tions to the bill are as follows :
First lt gives the : Governor, Secretary
of State and the Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction too much power.
Secondâ Lumber companies in the north
ern part of the Territory will secure the
leases; then the timber will be cut off and
the land become worthless.
Third âRanchmen on school lands be
lieve no compensation will be paid them
for improvements.
Citizens were highly indignant that Del
egate Murphy should slate to Congress/as
he is reported to have done/that this bill
was opposed by no one except those set
tled on , school lands. Practically every
one except those expecting to be benefited
by the bill are opposed to it.
HOCKENBERRY'S ANGER.
He Will Sue the Selma Irrigator for
Heavy Damages.
FRESNO, Cal., March 2.â Jacob Hock
enberry, who has gained much local fame
because of : his suit against G. W. Smith,
late candidate for Sheriff of this county, to
recover money loaned the aspiring politi

SUISUN DA At AGE SUIT.
Edward de Haven Brings Action Against
.: the Southern Fuel fie,
SUISUN, Cal., March 2.â Edward de
Haven of Elmira, by his guardian ad litem,
Alfred de Haven, has filed . a , suit -j in . the
Superior Court of Solano County against
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
praying for judgment for the sum of $50,
--000"by reason of injuries received and
alleged to have been caused by the care
lessness and negligence â¢ of - the â  railroad
company.
De , Haven was riding in a wagon along
a road in Elmira crossed by a railroad
tract, last September. . His horses became
unmanageable -and ran across trie track,
escaping, the Vacaville engine, which was
backing down, by only three feet. -
Thinking the engine would strike the
front of the wagon, the boy jumped from
the back of it. He fell across the track
and both arms were crushed by the engine,
amputation being necessary. ,
The plaintiff alleges no warning was
given, as required by the law. Being de
prived of the means of earning a liveli
hood, he considers he is entitled to dam- r
ages for injuries received.

PRAISE FOR THE PRESS
Congregational Preachers Think
It Is Good, but Might Be
Better.
MONDAY MORNING MEETINGS.
Rev. J. D. Foster Deplores Its Alleged
Prejudgment of "Our Own
Dr. Brown."
That its members had pronounced views
in relation to Dr. Brown's trial and the
comments thereon was. shown by the Con
gregational Monday Club's discussion of
Rev. J. D. Foster's paper on "Thoughts on
Journalism" yesterday.
Mr. Foster said :
We are becoming a nation of newspaper
readers., People who have not time to read
books can snatch ; the. moments ; necessary for
the perusal of this lien terj literature. The
power of a great paper is tremendous In any
community. Therefore the question "What is
its influence?" may be answered by "Good and
bad." .
It is good in that It exposes crime and vice,
thus furnishing an example ,to evil-doers. It
is good in the fact that it furnishes informa
tion to all classes.
\lt is bad because of: its willingness to vilify
any one in the inter.est of partisanship.
The speaker stated that he had been
offered money to I give the details of an
assault upon a child whom be, the speaker,
had rescued from a life of vice.'i|p6_SfiÃSfcl
"Our own Dr. Brown," said he, "has not
received fair treatment," and in support
of his position stated that a newspaper
had opened its columns to comments on
the case by any one who chose to supply
them, the offer being . taken advantage of
to the extent of two columns of .opinions.
He resumed: x
1 wish five things might be done. First, I
would like to see patrons discriminate in favor
of the metropolitan paper whose sins are the
least in this line. - Next, I would have the re
sponsibility placed where it belongsâ not upon
the reporter or correspondent, out the editor,
who is the responsible head of the paper.
Again, I would have both newsgatherers and
editors helped in a modest and legitimate way
in making up the paper with what is fragrant
and delicious. -*â¢''-'..-â â '
Seventy-five thousand ministers and hun
dreds of thousands of church-going people in
this country ought to be ashamed that their
power is not more marked where there are
such opportunities for usefulness.
I would see that the editor received occa
sional notes from the subscribersâ not such a
note as would insult him, but one commend
ing the good points and deprecating the bad.
Last, I would see a good paper' established by
endowment by some wealthy man If need be.
' : Captain Cook ridiculed the idea -of a
paper being controlled by a Stanford or
Huntington, and reaching the ideal up
held. ,
Dr. Hood said the American press was
diluting the public : mind. He favored
condensations and said lessons could be
learned from the leading journals of
Europe. '
John Kimball said the good things were
not exploited by the press. "If a man
behaves himself," said he, "the papers
ignore him. Our Sunday papers go far
toward ruining the people*. They are a de
moralizing agency, catering to bad, low
tastes. If they go for a lamb they will
kill him."
Dr. Pond spoke words of praise and j
blame for the press and deplored what he
regarded as its tendency to prejudge sus
pects. "I consider; Durrant a terribly
abused man," said he. . ... â ."..:..
Rev. Joseph Rowell thought it should
be made a penal offense to publish a paper
of more than four pages. In his judgment
the press should be a conservator of public
morals. "/ .. -'â ' â¢ '.v.j.->si-'
I Rev. William Rader observed that news
papers were not forced upon people. They
usually come in answer to a request in tbe
form of a subscription. ""I am a news
paper fiend,", continued that gentleman.
"I read them carefully, and am , sorry )
when I have finished. I believe it was
Brice who said San Francisco papers were
the worst published. lam sure he has not
seen the Boston GloDe, for instance. The
newspapers are an actual reflection of life.
I think the wart on Cromwell's nose
should appear in his portrait. The papers
made Talmage. They unmade Beecher.
They are keeping Ballington Booth and
his wife in this country. I feel grateful to
the press. It is a friend to the church, the
ministry and the people."
Meyer Strauss believed the newspapers
held a mirror up to nature. If politicians,
ministers and business men go wrong the
hideousness of their lives should be ex
posed. "The press elevates," he said. > "It
does not degrade."
Rev. W. H. Tubb considered the press
purer than the pulpit in some instances.
The idea of an endowed newspaper was
Utopian. In : these days of rampant vil
lainy it could not be exposed too much.
"The newspapers do their work for
money," said Rev. W. A. Tenney, "but so
do preachers and farmers. 'We may reject
what we do not want. I did not read the
Overman letters, because I did not choose
to." - ./".",/.-/,'/-. 7im
i H. H. Wikoff took exception to the state
ment that preachers worked for money,
and favored the idea of an endowed press.
Dr. Warren said Â« he had never read
stronger -condemnation of vices than in
the newspapers. Neither had he seen
stronger pleas for charities than in their
pages. "We don't; know what we are
talking about when we condemn the news
papers for chronicling events that have
actually transpired," said the doctor.
J. A. Chamberlain . spoke strongly for
the press. Rev. Philip Coombs consid
ered newspaper reading harmful to chil
dren.'. 'f3&E$SB&&BB3&&
Rev. J. B. Orr said the endowed news
paper would not be sustained, even by
its present advocates. > "Do you favor an
expurgated edition of the Bible?" he
asked; "yet you are advocating that for
the, newspapers."
â . A letter from Presiding Elder Coyle,
thanking the club for its offer of co-opera
tion in a"id of Dr. M. F. Colburn, was read
by Dr. -Pond.

ARE RACING TO VALPARAISO.
An Ocean Voyage of Steamships Upon
7(777^Whieh Big Bets Are Made.
NEW YORK, N. V., March The Brit
ish steamships Kara and Coya, which are
chartered respectively by the rival ship
ping firms of W. R. Grace & Co. and Hem
en way & Browne, started yesterday on a
race for Valparaiso, Chile, each with a large
cargo of general merchandise. It is stated
that S. W. W. Caldwell of ' W. R. Grace A
Co. and : Mr. Jaffrey of Hemenway &
Browne have bet $2000 on the result of the
race, which . may not be ended under sev
enty days, including the time of stopping
at ports on the route to take on coal and
discharge cargo. '. '
The Coya is 322 feet long, or thirty-two
feet : longer than , the Kara, and has forty
more horsepower. Both vessels are of
steel and have triple-expansion engines.
Captain Walsh of â¢ the Kara is unfamiliar
with ; the Magellan Straits, and r will be ac
companied; by Captain . Charles Barstow,
who knows ali about them. Captain W.
W. Browne of the Coya has made frequent
trips to Valparaiso and ; does not need an
assistant navigator. The ships will cut off
a good many miles by going .through the
straits instead of rounding the Horn. .
ABSINTHE IN HEW YOEK.
The Manufacture of That . â  Peculiar
French Beverage as It Is Carried On.
Though the French colony in New York j
is not large, its influence is . considerable.
Table d'hotes of every price, from 50 cents j
up to $2, flourish, most of them within the j
mile circle of Madison Square. Every
visitor to the metropolis thinks it obliga- !
tory upon him to patronize at least one of â 
these during his ' stay, and their fame is
widespread. But a more interesting indi
cation of French influence in New York is I
in the growth in the consumption of ab- j
sinthe: here and the establishment of an j
absinthe manufactory in the very center of
the city. This place is two blocks off of
Broadway and close to Fourteenth street.
There is more than one firm of New
York city absinthe manufacturers,
only one that carries on the business on a j
large scale. In cellars and rear basements
in both the old French quarter and the
new there are a dozen or more little
Frenchmen who prepare this vicious bev
erage for their own trade in secret, and sell
it for the real Parisian article of the high
est quality. The one large manufacturer j
alluded to goes about his making of the
seductive beverage much more openly, as
indeed he has to, for his machinery is elab
orate and takes up a good bit of space in
his back yard.
Nearly every day in the year he has this
machine working, and his product is about
a thousand gallons a month. Twelve thou
sand gallons a year is a ; great quantity,
when it is considered that a drinK of ab
sinthe is simply a tabiespoonful of the
extract, mixed with syrup and water until
there is a tumblerful of milky liquid. : The
American absinthe is never offered to
Frenchmen who visit the cafes or French
hotels in this city. They would detect the j
difference quickly. But to a man who is
not an absinthe' expert, that turned' out
almost within the roar of Broadway is just
as good.
The machinery this New York manu
facturer uses was imported from Paris sev- i
eral years ago, and it is an elaborate, j
costly piece of French construction. His
process of making tbe liqueur is exactly
like that in vogue in France, save that he
has to -.'distil, dried wormwood leaves in
stead of fresh ones. The wormwood he
imports in barrels, and the process is com
pleted by the careful addition of certain
flavoring extracts. : >^SSG|p_f(p^p9fisÃ|
The manager of one French hotel of the
city said the other day that he was selling
more absinthe now than at any time in the
hotel's history. "Another thing worth
nothing is / that one of the best cafes in
New York, a place that is famed for its
French liqueurs, a good aealof Amer
can-made absinthe from this manufac
turer. ?-j_*Sffig-MgjlÃÃi__^^
In the best cafes . the . absinthe served,
whether' French or American, is fairly
good, at least. But a very different qual
ity is to be found in the Bleecker-street
region, where the French quarter was sev
eral ; years ago, and where now the few
Frenchmen left, almost invariably of the
lower class/hobnob with negroes and Ital
ians. In the drinking places in that dis
trict one gets a tumblerful of absinthe for
5 cents. It is rank poison, highly flavored,
almost as bad, if not quite so effective in
its results, as the "dead-house whiskey" of
the river fronts. / This decoction is made
on the premises, or close , by, secretly and
in small quantities, according to the de
mand.New York Tribune.
STILL AHEAD.
The Battle-Ship Kearsarge More For
midable Than the Majestic.
Comparisons of the latest American and
British ; warships clearly show that our
traditional superiority in fighting force
and . efficiency still maintained. , . The
American Kearsarge and the British Ma
jestic are types of the most recent armor
clads of the first class designed in either
country. In point of displacement the
Majestic has the advantageâ our officers
believing that the excessive size and con
sequent deep draught of such a ship would
make her less useful for coast and harbor
defense than a smaller vessel. -.'â  In the all
essential characteristic of battery-power,
however, the American armor-clad holds
the pre-eminence. Here is a statement of
the guns carried by the two ships and the
weight of ; metal which*, each can throw at
one discbarge of its entire armament:

From these significant figures it is easy
to understand the esteem in which our
navy, nominally small though it is, is held
by nations which have many more vessels
of all classes than we can boast of. The
extraordinarily ; high quality of our : indi
vidual ships gives our fleet an importance
out of.all proportion to its actual number.

ARTIFICIAL REFRIGERATION.
Carbonic Acid for This ,* Purpose Is
Largely Used in Europe.
In the past few years carbonic hydride,
or carbonic acid; as it is usually called, has
forged rapidly to the front as a refrigerant
throughout Europe. Hitherto mechanical
difficulties have prevented its adoption,
but these ; have . been entirely overcome,
and now over 500 machines are in use and
giving entire /satisfaction. This is 7 the
more noteworthy as it has made especial
strides in Germany/ the birthplace of me
chanical â¢.refrigeration. ,-. Fuel there is a
very expensive item, and " only the most
economical i devices are adopted. Com
pound and triple expansion engines; with
condensers; are used largely, and the same
economy jis - practiced in ; th ' selection 7of
ice and refrigerating machines. /â /.'"."â 
/ Recently manufacturers of /the carbonic
acid machine obtained a contract;' in open
competition i with all ; the best ammonia
machine manufacturers, for the refrigerat
ing i plant in tne city slaughter-house in
Carlsruhe, because their { guarantee as to
the amount > of -* power and ;; cooling â  water
was better than; any other. '/In the official
test by Professor Braver it was found that
25 per cent less power and cooling water
was required than has been guaranteed.
".-,' Besides its economical action it' has ad
vantages over ammonia and other refriger
ants now in use/Its boiling point , at at
mospheric pressure 'is * 108 degrees below
zero, F., so that a most intense cold can be
produced by its use. : ; Ii is a commercial
commodity, largely â  in the universal
soda water fountains and is easily obtained
at one-third the cost of ammonia.
It is : odorless and non-corrosive. To
those familiar? with the corrosive effects
of ammonia this latter advantage speaks
with ; all â¢ the * more . force. Brass, copper
and other materials can be used in the con
struction of- the carbonic acid machine.
In the event of the escape of gas no
serious damage can occur, as in the case
of ammonia. The experiment of allow
ing the entire charge to escape into the
engine-room has been tried,, without
affecting *. in any way the engineers or
others in the building/This manes the
machine especially -adapted' for marine
service and for use in hotels, where an
escape would be especially harmful. As
carbonic acid is a component of beer it is a
machine for. the brewery. In the event of
any escape, beer [ would be improved, if
anything, while there can be no question
of the deleterious effects of ammonia on
beer. -
Brewers can collect carbonic acid arising
from their fermenting tubs, compress it,
carbonate their entire product and also use
a portion to refrigerate their plants. As it
has a preservative effect on meats, it is also
the refrigerator for packers and cold-stor
age men. With ammonia meat would be
blackened- and spoiled in the event of a
leak. In the event of tire carbonic acid
also has the advantage over ammonia. The
latter tends to . extinguish an incipient
blaze, but with high temperatures becomes
an explosive. | Carbonic acid â  will act as an
extinguisher at any temperature. Car
bonic acid is a much denser gas than am
monia, so that in spite of the higher pres
sure there is really less danger of an escape.
The machine itself is of the compressive
order, consisting merely of a compressor,
condenser and refrigerator. It has no oil
pump, oil separator or oil cooler to compli
cate it. As the cylinder volume required
is very much less than" with ammonies
the cylinders can be made much smaller
and the whole machine more compact. As
the parts are all small, it is no easy matter
to design them so as to stand the high
pressure required. As the diameter of the
cylinder is less there is less friction and
less power required. Although there are
a few machines of this type in America in
operation they nave not been largely intro
duced. A company, with works and office
located at Johnstown, Pa., has been re
cently formed, and will push the manufac
ture of tho machines.
Paul Jones.
Rear- Admiral Meade made a speech
about Paul Jones at a dinner given in his
honor at Philadelphia recently. Admiral
Meade said that Paul Jones represented
the ideal naval commander more nearly
than any man in historr. He summed up
his services for the Americans as follows:
"Paul Jones' fought twenty-three battles
at sea and was never once vanquished. In
his various raids on tne English coast
he spread the most intense alarm in
Great Britain. By . his reprisals on the
English coast he compelled the Brit
ish troops in America to desist from their
atrocious system of pillage and burning,
and compelled the King's Government
to exchange as prisoners of war the Amer
icans they had captured and cruelly im
mured in loathsome and filthy prisons,
treating them -as 'traitors, pirates and
felons.' " '
In . countries where oranges grow in
plenty country gentlemen use the cheap
est kind , for .blacking their, boots. The
orange is cut in two and the juice side of
one-half is rubbed on the soot of an iron
pot and then on the boot. Then the boot
is nibbed with a soft brush and a bright
polish at once appears. :

DAVID M. FOLTZ, Special Agent.
TUESDAY MARCH 3. 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Free Cuba is something of a crisis itself.
All roads that lead to good roads are
good.
March has come in like a lion with his
tail twisted.
The good roads convention has the town
and the State is with it.
The cold wave fluttered the orchards,
but it will boom fruit prices.
Spain may not be strong enough to fight
us, but she is mad enough to try.
The Venezuelan affair was only a flurry,
but this thing begins to look serious.
Breaking the weather record in these
days seems about as easy as breaking a bi
cycle record.
It is pleasing to remember at this time
that in all war talk there is always more
talk than war.
The Queen Regent may not send us an
ultimatum, but it is a safe bet she will
have the last word.
It may be as well to notify the East at
once that our cold wave was only a slight
frost and no blizzard.
Now that another crisis has arisen we
may expect to hear that Cleveland has re
turned to his shooting.
Presidential politics are in agitation all
round the horizon, but the center is still
as calm as a summer's noon.
The next thing we know Mr. Hunting
ton will rise up to declare that his testi
mony was intended for irony.
We must now talk of snowy mountains
as well as flowery fields if we wish to get
in all the poetry of the situation.
It begins to look as if it would be better
to hold our festivals in midwinter and save
the spring days for the family fireside.
The proposal to change the name of Cor
bett avenue to Western boulevard is street
improvement in name only, but it will do.
Asa candidate for the Democratic Presi
dential nomination Mr. Olney seems to be
in the position where all the lightning
strikes.
Come war or come peace the country
will support the President, but all the
same it will wish the President were some
other fellow.
"We shall have to insist that Truckee
turn her toboggan slide the other way
and quit spilling her snowstorms over
this side of the State.
In extending to Spain those "friendly
offices" the Senate talked of, Mr. Olney
will have to put a good deal of emphasis
on the friendly phrase.
Before we begin any fight for the inde
pendence of Cuba we had better fix up our
tariff and make ourselves independent of
foreign money-lenders.
Isn't it about time for somebody to name
a paper The Cathode Ray ? Or possibly The
X Hay would be more exact and at the
same time more startling. ,
Congress may as well understand that
bo long as it leaves the work of tariff re
vision undone the people will consider
that nothing has been done.
The investigation of the funding bill in
the committee-room has disclosed plenty
of good ammunition for use when the big
fight comes off in the House. â¢
It is now announced that General Wey
ler is a German, and so all the eloquent de
nunciations of the innate cruelty of Span
iards is lost in the illimitable inane.
The Spanish mob that dragged the stars
and stripes through the mud of the streets
of Madrid has done more for free Cuba
than all the eloquence of the Senate.
Ever since the close of the last elections
the Republican Congressional committees
have been lost in the shuffle, and now, lo
and behold ! they turn up as trumps.
If we should be forced into a war with
Spain under this administration, Mr. Lin
coln's remark about not swapping horses
while crossing a stream will have an ex
ception. - â 
From the suddenness with which the
cold wave struck us it would seem that
Nansen has not only discovered the north
pole, but is bringing it home by way of the
Pacific Coast. *
The near approach of the . Presidential
campaign is made evident by the fact that
some Eastern papers are disputing which
candidate when standing on the platform
would show the most pulchritudinous
legs. â¢ ;"â _."
- Ballington Booth will start an army in
opposition to his father, arid by the time
he gets it well under way some enterpris
ing general will branch off from it to start
another, arid in that way the army will
multiply itself.
The Trinity Journal has published a list
of the lauds the railroad is attempting to
patent in that county and says the total
amount comprises over 41,000 acres- and r is
rich in mineral. By the publication of the
list the people are given notice of the rail
road scheme and the Journal urges all who
. have locations en the ground ,to tile pro
tests at once. ; ' - "
OVERSENSITIVE SPAIN.
There, is something significant in the
extreme" sensitiveness with which Spain
resents American interference in its
struggle with Cuba. The resolution passed
by the Senate was most friendly and dig
nified. Nothing in the nature of a threat
or an -ultimatum was hinted /.at;; in its
phraseology. It provided merely that the
President exercise his friendly offices in
conferring with Spain over the situation,
with a view to the establishment of Cuban
independence and the recognition of Cuban
belligerency. That so grievous offense lias
been taken may be regarded as evidence
that Spain's conscience has been pricked
in a sore place. There was absolutely no
excuse for the violent demonstrations of
hostility toward the United- States repre
sentative; at Madrid and Barcelona. Spain
by those acts has given far greater offense
to the United States than the Senate
resolution could have given to Spain.
So far as the acts of the Cuban insurgents
are concerned, they have not shown any
departure from the methods of civilized
warfare. The Cubans have destroyed
property, but only that of the enemy, and
for the purpose of crippling his lighting
efficiency. On the other hand, the Spanish
authorities on the island stand charged
with the commission of atrocities that have
roused the indignation of the world. Gen
eral Campos was removed for the sole
reason that he was pursuing civilized
methods, and General Weyler was placed
in command for the sole reason and with
the avowed intention of instituting a mer
ciless campaign of blood and iron. He has
begun well on that line, and it was not
until his acts of savagery were flaunted
that the Senate of the United States saw
fit to interfere with a suggestion of media
tion.
The Spaniards are a fighting raceâ there
is no doubt about that. History furnishes
nothing more wonderful than their throw
ing off of the Moorish yoke after they had
worn it for half a thousand years. Spain
lost no time in recognizing the belliger
ency of the Confederate States after our
civil war had begun. We kept our hands
off entirely during the ten years' war for
Cuban independence, and have waited a
year in the present war before even mak
ing a suggestion. Spain is putting herself
in the wrong. This fact is important, for
it will likely exert an influence with those
European nations which otherwise might
be inclined to sympathize with her against
us. Sunday's outbreak would not have
been worthy of great notice had it not
been followed with a passionate demand
from the Prime Minister that the Presi
dent of the United States compel the Sen
ate to eat its words. There is need for all
the more patience on our part in dealing
with a people so passionate and combative,
but that does not imply any necessity for
neglecting our duty as a civilized nation
and our regard for National dignity.
AN INTERESTING RUMOR.
It will be some time yet before the news
of Nansen's alleged discovery of the north
pole can be confirmed, and meanwhile we
are treated to an interesting speculation
on the probabilities of the discovery hav
ing been made not by Xansen, but by John
M. Verhoeff, an American lad born at
Louisville of Dutch parents and for a loq_
time a resident of San Francisco. Ver
hoeff had a mania for Arctic exploration,
and by reason of his liberal financial as
sistance to the Peary expedition of 1891 he
was made a member of the Peary party
and given the position of mineralogist.
So much for the preliminaries. Now
comes the story proper : â -; .7-1
Verhoeff had a good scientific education,,
an iron constitution and an insatiable
thirst for Arctic knowledge. On the Peary
expedition he systematically inured him
self to the hardships of the far northern
climate, hobnobbed on all possible occa
sions with the Esquimaux, learned to eat
their repulsive food and exhibited a veiled
disinclination to return with Peary. In
August, 1892, a week before Peary was to
start on the return trip, Verhoeff asked
and was granted permission to make a
further study of the geology of a region in
the vicinity. Singularly enough be took
an unnecessary quantity of clothing and
food and all his instruments, and when he
failed to return on time a search party was
hastily organized to find him. They fol
lowed a trail which they took to be his,
and it led them tip a glazier to enormous
crevices. Thinking that he had fallen
into one and lost bis life they returned
and the report was cent out that the
young man was dead.
His relatives, after a study of the evi
dence, arrived at the firm conclusion that
the young man had deserted, deliberately
leaving presumptive evidence of his death,
and that be had struck out on his own ac
count, assisted by the natives, to discover
the pole. They assume that he has suc
ceeded and is working his way back, and
that the news of the discovery comes from
him, and not from Nansen. The case cer
tainly is full of interest and presents no
element of the incredible. It is even pos
sible that Verhoeff may have fallen in
with Nansen eitner before or after the dis
covery of the pole, that he or Nansen sepa
rately or together made the discovery, and
that they are returning together. Time
will solve all these questions.
As Verhoeff was an educated man and a
member of a party of polar discovery it is
rational to assume that he had sufficient
knowledge to determine the pole if he
should find it. The news with regard to
the "instruments" which he is said to have
taken is too vague to be instructive, but as
the needful instruments in such miner
alogical work as be likely did might have
been very few, and as he might have done
without any at all for that purpose, he
may be assumed to have taken astronom
ical instruments instead. The whole sub
ject is of great interest by reason of the
credit attaching to the discovery, if it has
been made.
TYPICAL * PEOSPERITY.
The rapid progress which Grass Valley
has been making lately is fairly indicative
of the "condition prevailing . in all the
quartz-mining sections of California, and
it represents the good results issuing from
renewed activity in.the. the mining industry.
This has been brought about partly by the
discovery that the value of the old mines
had never been fully appreciated, arid
partly by the introduction of electricity as
a motive power. Naturally satisfactory
results in working the old mines has led to
developing new properties, and so a whole
some stimulation is proceeding all along
the line. . Â».-.s
Grass Valley has an ideal situation. As
its name indicates it is a valley covered
with grass, and this in turn means abund
ant water and excellent fruit lands. .Its
population of 8000 souls would fail ;to
furnish material for stories of the Bret
Harte order, as prosperity, wealth and re
finement' characterize the people. The
source of all this comfort is the gold of the
mines, arid as that is but in the beginning
of its development the future of the valley
is exceedingly- bright.
It is proper to. call atten tion to these
refining* accompaniments ' of /a' great ; in
dustry for the reason that they indicate a
condition of affairs that does not apper
tain to gold-mining districts in other parts
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 1896.
of the world. With such an adjustment to
the higher conditions of civilization one
may expect to find an absence of ; those
perils which attach to a new district.
Where mining is conducted as an earnest,
legitimate industry, as it is in California,
prospective investors run no risk of being
waylaid by sharpers and swindled out of
their ' money. The industry here is as
stable, dignified and clean as that of agri
culture. Investors in mines have not only
the protection of efficient laws, but well
established settlements of refined and law
abiding persons, cherishing a profound re
spect for the rights of persons and prop
erty.
Apart from all this is a certain knowl
edge of undeveloped resources and abund
ant facilities already installed for prose
cuting the business on the most scientific
and economical lines. It is this last-named
phase of mining in California that is par
ticularly valuable.. The unlimited supply
of water in the Sierras is convertible into
all kinds of uses favorable to the industry
of mining and to the health and comfort
of those engaged in the -business. It has
been only recently, that the great utility
of this water supply has begun to be prop
erly â employed, its best use being in the
generation of electricity for mining pur
poses. The stranger . has only to visit
Grass Valley to see the superior conditions
obtaining in mining far gold in California.
THE STANFORD DECISION.
The Supreme Court lias acted with un
usual promptness in the Stanford case
and by a decision affirming the judgment
of the lower courts has decided that the
estate oi Leland Stanford is not liable for
any portion of the debt due to the Gov
ernment by the Central Pacific Railroad
Company. This decision closes the . case
and the Government has no further re
course or appeal.
As the result of the decision will be to
relieve the great university founded -by
Leland Stanford and Mrs. Stanford from
any danger of losing so large a portion of
its revenues as was sued for by the, Gov
ernment, the news of the decision will be
received with complaisance by the great
majority of Californians. The university
was founded and endowed for the benefit
of California and has already proven its
great usefulness in the cause of education.
The decision is virtually a decree in favor
of the people although in.express terms it
declares against them, and. there is good
reason for a general sympathy with the
rejoicing that prevails at Palo Alto.
The Stanford estate has long since ceased
to be private property in anything more
than name. Under the management of
the noble woman who now directs it all
its revenues pass to the service of the uni
versity and through the influence of that
institution to the State at large. The ad-
vancement at Palo Alto, which has been
somewhat checked by the suit brought by
the Government, will now go forward
without further hindrance. That the uni
versity is destined to become in the near
future one of the greatest seats of learning
in the world none can question, and in
contemplating the magnificent plan upon
which the foundations were laid, the
broad system of education designed to be
carried out. and the potent influence it is
certain to exert in the upbuilding of the
true grandeur of the State, there will surely
come to all a sense of gratification with
the knowledge that the estate is not to be
shorn of any part of its great proportions,
but will remain for all time as an endow
ment to carry out the will of the munifi
cent founder.
CRIPPLE CREEK AFFAIRS.
The whole truth with regard to the Crip
! ple Creek mining boom is now coming to
light, and it will be found very instructive
when compared. with the gold-mining in
dustry of California. A very important
circumstance has been recently developedâ
the newcomers at Cripple Creek are dying
of pneumonia at the average rate of one a
day. This might have been expected in a
place having an elevation above the sea
equal to that of Bodie.
Geological considerations are equally
important. All the mines from which ore
is being taken are as yet shallow, the deep
est being only 900 feet. Experience has
shown thus far that the deeper the work
ing the poorer the ore. The opposite con
dition prevails in California. Within' the
last few years numerous mines in the
mother lode which had been abandoned
as worked out have been reopened and the
shafts sunk deeper, with the result that far
richer ores than were ever taken from
them before are encountered. Many of
the Cripple Creek mines which yielded
rich ore on the surface and were floated at
fabulous prices are rapidly retrograding
with deeper sinking. The trouble seems
to be, not that the gold area is small, for
in fact it is about eleven miles long and'
six wide, but that there is a remarkable
diffusion of the metal. Even the plutonic
rocks, mostly granite, carry gold running
from a trace to $5 a ton ; but of course
this cannot be shipped out and profitably
worked. In California, on the other hand,
one of the ordinary expectations of the
miner is to encounter at any moment an
excessively rich body of ore.
Most of the work in Cripple Creek is be
ing done by "rustlers" men whose busi
ness is to boom mines and float the stock.
That this is so may be inferred from these
facts: The actual output in 1895 was only
$8,750,000, and the expectation for the cur
rent' year is merely double that amount.
The production per capita in the district is
less than $200 a - year. About 250 claims
are shipping ore of content less than $25,
and 100 less than $15â "shipping ;at a
loss," it is declared by the New York
Tribune, "in order to bear the reputation
of being producers." The average depth
of shipping mines is less than 250 feet.
About twelve mines are paying 30 per cent
profit and four are paying 400 percent. It
is carefully estimated ; that, even rated as
"gambles," considering location, patented
area, management,: capitalization and
present location, probably one-third of all
mines are not worth the prices being paid.
The whole situation in California Is en
tirely different. The boomer and manipu
lator* are unknown. There is no excite
ment whatever and hundreds of mines can
be bought for a fraction of their value
from owners who have not the capital to
develop them. Better than all that, we
have but recently learned that the gold
store is practically inexhaustible, by rea
son of the fact that the deeper the work
ings are pushed the richer the ore.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
. . . . San Francisco, March 2, 1896.
To the Editor of the Callâ Sib: As The "Call has
warmly championed the cause of struggling
Cuba from the first rising against Spanish op- J
pression, I hope you will allow me space to say
a few words' in favor of that cause at this criti
cal juncture when Hie manly stand which the
United States Senate and all its leading mem
bers have taken for freedom and humanity on
this continent will soon find a ready response
in the legislative bodies of all other independ
ent American peoples. V It has, I believe, been
too much the fashion among Americans of
Anglo-Saxon stock to decry the patriotism and
statesmanship among the Latino-Americans.
But let them read the complaints made by the
illustrious Washington of the lukewarmness
and want of self-denial on the part of his
countrymen when he himself was struggling
and fighting for ; independence from domina
tion by a European King and Parliament, and
then compare the history of the United States
revolutionary war with the heroic deeds of
decades of desperate combats against Spanish
tyranny in Mexico, Colombia, the Argentina,
Chile, Peru and Cuba. I think, mutatis mu
tandis, the Ladinos need not be ashamed of
their Hidalgos. Bolivars, San Mnrins, etc.
After all, great political questions are not
solely decided by: calculation. Large hearts
will comprehend the necessity of action at the
right moment by their own feelings as much
as by argument. It is to be hoped that the ex
ecutive of the United States Government will
understand the expression of its own and, as it
is to be expected, of all other American na
tions'sentiment.. The commission which the
President is to receive may leave him the de
tail of execution, but we may be sure that the
main object and purpose; cannot be misunder
stood.: This is the time to show America and
the world. what stuff the. United States are
made of. Frederick the. Great wrote: "Repub
lics fulfill more promptly the design of their
institution and hold out better, for good
Kings die, . but wise laws are immortal.
There is unity in the end which republics
propose and in the means which they employ,
and they therefore almost never miss their
aim." â .-. Â--;.;â¢'
That stern old King refused to the Ger
man troops hired by the English for use against
their colonies in rebellion the march through
his territory, and though a neutral sent to
Washington's head-quarters General Steuben as
drilhnaster of the colonials. "?*_fgÃffÃ â -â â '.-
Nations as well as individuals ought to have
the courage of their convictions." Senator
Sherman has frankly confessed that he would
rather see an independent Cuba federated to
Mexico than to the United States. I sympa
thize with him, though I believe the trend of
events is more the other way. Anyhow, the
sublime question of Cuba's freedom is not one
of dollars, but of ideas, as Bancroft in his
history of the United Mates contends it was so
in the revolutionary war. Spain may take *_
lesson from this which would do her more good
than a sanguinary reconquest of the Pearl of
the Antilles. Respectfully, 11. 8.
THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH.
Facts and Figures Which May Account foe
the Prevailing Depression.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
A young girl once saved a railroad train filled
with people from plunging to swift destruc
tion, where a bridge had been swept away in a
storm, by rushing down to the track and wav
ing a danger . signal to the engineer. Her
brave deed has been justly honored in verse
and by fit reward. Why should we cherish
quite another feeling for those who raise a
danger signal when the general welfare is
menaced? Why should we blame them for so
much as intimating that there is danger?
The theme of the present letter is not chosen
because it is likely to please the greatest num
ber of readers, but because there Is dangerous
ignorance on the subject. In fact, how many
intelligent readers in a thousand really know
anything definite as to the concentration of
wealth in the United States from 1860 to 1890?
The census tells us, and thus states it: >
â¢ Total Producers' Capitalists'
Year." wealth, percent, percent.
1860....... 516,000,000,000 43i_ â¢ 56i/ 2

1890....... 61.000,000,000 17 83
* In 1890 the total wealth of the Nation was
nearly four times greater than in 1800 while
the producers got only 17 per cent of it in
place of 43V4 thirty years before, and the capi
talists got 83 per cent instead of 56J_ per cent
in 1800. In 1800 the producers got well on to

1890 they got less than one-fifth. The - In
creased use of machinery,* which is always
owned by the capitalists, gave them the greater
part of the advantage 'by greatly reducing the
number of persons employed. v.-.
But .this does not; tell half : the story. In
trade circles the change has been even peril
ous. By the formation of great corporations in
the form of trusts and combines, such as the
Standard Oil trust, ; the meat . trust, the flour
trust, the leather trust, the lumber trust and
the coal trust and a hundred other powerful
trusts, including the great department stores,
small dealers have been crushed and vast for
tunes ;of many millions have been concen
trated in the vaults of these corporations. As
these trusts all comprise prime articles of
daily consumption by the ' plain people, and
the people are helpless and 'â ; wholly in ' the
power of the trusts, j they simply have to pay
whatever tribute these trust barons see fit to
levy. â â , , â ââ  â â -â â - t
Thus,, for example, the Standard Oil trust
recently raised the price of oil 5 cents per gal
lon, and it has to be paid by the 000, 000
people who use it for light and fuel, the other
10,000,000 well-to-do and rich people using
gas and electric light. These 60,000,000 plain
people represent 12,000,000 families averaging
five members each, who each use about a five
gallon can of oil a month, making the con
sumption of oil y 12,000,000 cans a month.
The increase of 5 cents ; a gallon is 25 cents on
a five-gallon can, and on 12,000,000 cans used
In a month the increased income of the Stand
ard Oil Trust is $3,000,000 a month or $30,
--000,000; a year. > The j intelligent reader . can
easily figure out the tribute paid by the people
to the other trust barons, a tribute which no
one can refuse to pay until the people unite
and set up a system of doing . business i which
will eliminate the trust and render such cor-
? orate â  combinations of capital ' absolutely
utile.. .-;â  -;â¢ â '.-â¢â¢ - ",,: â  â¢*-.. :- -..-.
**â * If we now add to the trust . corporations just
considered,' the banking, telegraph, teleDhone.
railroad, street-car, electric power and kindred
corporations, with their enormous wealth * and
their .-- unlimited ':-' power â  to â ***. levy *i and 7 col
lect tribute from the people, we can begin to
realize how it is possible for George K. Holmes,
Special Census *,- Agent, to show - from census
tables that we had in i 1890 .4000 millionaire
families who "owned" $1,200,000,000," or one
fifth of the entire wealth -of the country ;
that there were 1,250,000 rich families who
had $36,600,000,000, or more than half of the
entire wealth of the country; in a word, that
these two classes "owned. 7l per cent of the
total wealth, which left 11 ,500,000 families
with only 20 per cent of the total wealth. But
that is not all. He found that there : were
6,600,000 poor ; families, * over half the total
population, who owned but 5 per cent of the
wealth, that is to say, only $454 to each family,
j in contrast with the 4000 millionaire families
I who each had $3,000,000. , Compared in other
ways, one family, out of every 300 "owned"
$3,000,000, and over half the families had but."
$454 to each family.
In view of these tactsâ facts which we cannot
call unreliableâ lt is not hard to understand
why times are bad and growing worse. It is
certain that more than half the people, with
i an average of only $454 1 to a family, must be
engaged in ahaiid"-to-hand fight for existence,
and can lay up nothing, not a dollar a year.
In the meanwhile the Increase in the wealth
of the rich families goes on' continually ,'day
and night; and, as we have already seen, this
Increase in the manufacturing industry during
thirty years has more than doubled in the
amount gained by capitalists, while the
amount paid to producers, owing to a greater
use of machinery, has fallen to less than half;
that numerous great trusts have arisen and
amassed great fortunes; that great corpora
tions are enthroned, ruling the people and ac
cumulating untold millions, and we know that
strikes are numerous and murmurs are heard
everywhere, and that thoughtful men are
troubled.
Is it not clear that there must be a change,
and that it must come soon ? Blindly post
poning the evil day cannot be wise. It is cer
tain that the present order of production and
distribution i's creating a horde of outlaws, un
able to employ themselves and forbidden ac
cess to the land on such terms as will afford
them alivinsr, as all the land has passed into
private ownership except such inaccessible
and poor land as these impoverished people
cannot cultivate.
Let us all honestly try to find the way out of
present conditions. The people must have a
chance. Great public utilities must be made
to serve the people instead of being monopo
lized vby corporations to create millionaires.
Land monopoly must cease, for it is a crime
against society unless we have made a mistake
in thinking that the plain people who work
for a living should be free. Money lords must
allow the Government to control the supply of
money and place it within the reach of the
people" practically without interest. Work
must be found lor those who are forced into
idleness.' Good roads and needed public works
must be constructed at public expense, and
without the issue of interest-bearing bonds.

Simon Pureâ E. S., Livermore, Cal.. "Si
mon Pure," as meaning genuine or authentic,
is colloquial. It is derived from a comedy,
"A. Bold Stroke f.>r a Wife," written by Mrs.
Susanna Centlivre, an English writer, in 1717.
Simon Pure, a young Quaker from Pennsyl
vania, pays a visit to Obadiah Prim, a Bristol
Quaker and one of the guardians of Anno
Lovely, an heiress. Colonel Feignwell per
sonated Simon Pure and obtained Prim's
consent to marry his ward. At this
time the veritable Quaker . appears and
Colonel Feignwe'l denounces him as an
imposter, which necessitates the identifica
tion of the real Simon Pure. After the colonel
had obtained Prim's signature he confessed
the trick and declared that- the veritable
Quaker was Simon Pure, and from that origi
nated the saying that when a person is what
he represents himself to be or that article is
what it is represented to be it Is simon pure.

ric had cuffs, collars and revers in white
Eiquet with blouse of white embroidered

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Early Morning Southeaster
Caused Considerable
Damage.
MANY SHIPS DRAGGED ANCHOR
Whaling Vessels Made a Wreck of
Each Other at Little Main-
Street Wharf.
The sudden southeaster on the bay
yesterday morning caused extensive dam
age on the water front. Vessels were
| dragged from their moorings and others
| broke adrift, causing frequent collisions.
The gale came up about 2 a. m., and the
first vessels to suffer were those around
the wharves extending from the Mail dock
to Mission street.
At Main-street wharf were the whaling
bark Lydia and the steam whaler William
Baylies. Just across the way, at' Beaie
street wharf, was the revenue cutter Bear.
The latter was prepared for all emergen
cies, but the whalers were not. When
the southeaster struck the wharf the Lydia
parted her five-inch hawser just as though
it had been so much packthread and
drifted down on the Baylies. The latter
was ready, for sea, but the Lydia soon
made havoc among her headgear and
stays, and in a few minutes she appeared a
wreck. BmH
While the Lydia was at work oil the
steam-whaler, the latter was not idle. Her
bowsprit raked the bark and carried away
her deckhouse and nearly all her super
structure. By this time they Lyuia had
drifted down on the revenue cutter Bear,
and all hands we're called to avert the
danger. The watchman on the Lydia had
apparently "lost his head," so a crew was
put aboard her by Captain Tuttle, and soon
a whaleline had been passed to the wharf
and luckily it held. The bar* was gradually
warped back into her place and soon all
danger was over.
The Lydia will have to go on the dry
dock for repairs, and the William Baylies,
which was to have sailed for the Arctic
next Thursday, will be delayed another
week.
About the time the Lydia, William Bay
lies and Bear were mixed up the .scow
; schooner Jennie and Edna went adrift at
the same wharf and collided with the Ital
ian bark E. Raggio. The bark was not
: damaged, but the schooner lost her bow
; sprit and was otherwise severely injured.
When the gale came up Captain Chris
i tiansen of the Jennie and Edna attempted
|to put to sea after he went adrift. While
i working out of the slip he lost his bearings
i and went crashing into the Raggio.
At Howard street the British ship Fanny
I Kerr came very near going adrift. When
| the sale struck her one of the iron moor
! ing bits went, and a few minutes later one
!of the wooden posts was carried away. It
i did not take Captain Gibbons long to get
I on deck, however, anÂ«; in ten minutes after
the gale came up new lines were out and
i the Fanny Kerr was again riding in safety.
Mate Henderson of the bark Wilna at
| tempted to reach his vessel about 1 a. m.
, She was lying off in Mission Bay and he
| took a boat from Folsom-street . wharf.
, When the squall came down his boat cap
-1 sized and he drifted across the anchor
chains of the British ship Senator. He
I was hauled aboard and dried out. Captain
i Lewis took good care of him until his own
j vessel began to drag and then he had to
I get out and drop extra anchors in order to
| hold his ship- Lewis is nothing if not
cool-headed and it was not twenty minutes
after the storm came. up before he had
everything snug and his ship riding as
safely as though alongside the quay.
The Robert Searles with a cargo of sugar
was lying off the sugar relinerv. When
the storm struck her she went adrift, but
luckily the tug Fearless picked her up and
towed her to a place of safety.
The sealing schooner Penelope, which
came in after a forty-day cruise with 250
skins, also went adrift. Her anchor fouled
] the Postal Telegraph Company's cable.
j and yesterday morning it took the tug Ida
! W two hours to free the vessel.
All the morning papers were late in
â  reaching Oakland. The tugs Annie,
â¢ Millie and Amy dared not face the gale
i that was howling at 3:30 a. m., and in con
' sequence it was nearly 5 a.m. before the
; papers were delivered to the carriers. The
i carriers made extra good time, however,
ana in the case of The Call, at least, the
paper was not more than half an hour late.
The Oregon Coal and Navigation Com
| pany's Arago had a lively experience on
; the coast. After leaving Coos Bay she was
: caught in a gale and was thrown on her
â¢ beamends. Off Bandon the steamer
Homer spoke her, but the captain answered
: back that he had everything under control.
The Arago was hauled to the wind and
I had her head to the sea. The cargo was
trimmed, and late yesterday afternoon she
steamed into port as though nothing had
happened. Tne Arago went to Mission
s Bay direct, where she will discharge her
< deckioad of lumber into lighters.
The steamer.Wiltamette Valley, which
broke a crankpin after leaving San Fran
cisco and put into Ensenanda in distress,
is now on her way back in tow of the
steamer Bonita. The Willamette -Valley
is partly under her own steam, so Quick
I time to port may be expected. Some of
i the Mexican freight was discharged at San
| Diego, and from there will be forwarded to
I its destination. The. steamer Willamette
| Valley will probably arrive here to-morrow
I morning.
The sailing of the 'Oceanic Steamship
i Company's Monowai will probably be de
layed a couple of days. The English mails
are late and owing to the new law that
makes It imperative that all meats leaving
j this country be inspected, all the cases of
| canned goods now in the hold of the vessel
j may have to be discharged and inspected
I before the steamer can sail. Captain Carey
holds that as the canned meats were ship
ped before the law went into effect his
vessel is exempt, but nevertheless if the
Board of Health wants to split hairs they
can delay the ship. The Monowai has one
of the largest flour shipments ever taken
out of this port on an Australian steamer.
There is over 1200 tons on board for Sydney
alone and small Consignments for other
points.
The Pacific Mail; Company's Colon got
in from Panama and way ports yesterday.
Among the passengers were Mr. and Mrs.
William Beveridge of Panama. The . hus- j
band was an engineer on the railroad, but
latterly determined to return to San
Francisco. On the way up Mrs. Bev
eridge presented him with a son and neir
and the boy was christened Charles Mc-
Kinnon Colon Beveridge. The mother
wanted him called Charles and McKinnon
is after the captain and Colon after the
ship. Little Charles and Ethel Corona
Seidel, who was born on the steamer
Corona a few days ago, would make an in
teresting couple, say twenty years hence.
Dr. Jordan, the steamer's surgeon, took j
such good care of Mis. Beveridge that
when the Colon docked she was able to be j
' removed in a hack. ...'â¢' â¢ *
The British corvette Comus arrived from
San Diego yesterday morning. ; After com
ing to an anchor the American Hag was
run up and a salute of twenty-one guns

GOSPEL RESCUE WORK.
New Society Pledged to Works of Char
ity and Evangelization.
Much interest is being shown in religious
circles regarding the new Gospel Mission
ary and Rescue Society organized in this
City on New Year's day this year. The
society has at its head as president J. D.
Barton and as general manager F. L. Gau
thier. These two gentlemen, with a large
corps of devoted assistants, have been
hard at work since the society was formed
and have found many friends both able
and willing ta aid them. Donations of
, money, groceries and other necessaries for
the work have been received and are grate
fully acknowledge! by the management.
Among the most welcome gifts was a large
tent with chairs and pulpit furniture for
the meetings of the society. Mrs. Elizabeth
Aver, secretary of the organization, is en
thusiastic in her conviction that the work
will prosper.
"Our main object,"* she said yesterday,
"is to organize missions and rescue homes
wherever we can. In these missions we
hope to be able to aid the deserving poor
by means of donations from sympathizing
friends. This is one of our objectsâ to
remedy human suffering in a purely
human way. Our great end is, however,
to bring wanderers from* the right to a
sense of their unhappy state and induce

them to adopt a better course of life and
conduct, For this reason our by-laws
oblige all cur members to join some evan
gelical religious body of their own selec
tion. We interfere "with no church and
desire to aid the work of all. In. pursu
ance of this design we propose to travel
wherever we can and. esiablish mission
stations in the interior towns, leaving a
superintendent and assistants in charge of
each. In each place we visit meetings will
be held .in the tent which was given us,
and â¢we hope and trust that our work may
be abundantly blessed. Any material aid
in the way of groceries, dry goods, boots
and shoes, bedding, furniture and worn
clothing, as well as money, will contribute
greatly to the success of our labors."
INDICTED FOR FORGERY
Special Session of the Grand
Jury on but Short
Notice.
The Two Men Suspected of Passing
the Bank of Woodland
Check.
The Grand Jury held a special session
yesterday afternoon. The members were
called together at 3 o'clock on short notice
to indict Dean and McCloskey for forgery
in connection with the raised draft from
the Bank of Woodland, which was han
dled in this City by the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank and the Nevada Bank.
The witnesses called to the jury-room
were Captain Lees, Mr. Tompkins of
Woodland, George Grant of the Nevada
Bank, William H. Crocker of the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank and Willis Lyttle, a boy
who was employed one day in Dean's
office. "
There was testimony to the effect that
Joseph McCloskey, who has many aliases
and is known to the police throughout the
country as an all-around criminal, was
seen in the City with Dean the day the
money was obtained on the raised check.
The boy Lyttle was present when the coin
was placed in an express wagon by the two
men. l, i^^%tf^)*J'[l l _inTi?l-B-
The Grand Jury after hearing the wit-
I nesses went into Judge Slack's court and
I Frank Maskey, the foreman, presented in-
I dictments against Dean and McCloskey
respectively "for forgery. In the, usual
j form extradition papers will issue and an
> officer be sent to Minneapolis to bring the
j prisoners to this State for trial.
The Grand > Jury did ? not take up any
i other business, but adjourned immediately
j after the indictments were found.
Captain Lees received a dispatch yester
-1 day that Dean, under the name of Frank
! L. " Seaver, was convicted on May '20,
! 1891, in the United States Federal'
j Court in King's Count}-, New York; of
I counterfeiting and circulating standard
I dollars and was sentenced to three years
| in the State Prison.
ILLUSTRIOUS NAMES
Given to Good Indians of the Hoops
Valley Reservation.
Captain â  W. E. Dougherty, U. S. A., In
dian Agent at the. Hoopa Valley agency,
arrived in the City yesterday. Captain
Dougherty's second term of service at this
agency began three years ago, but prior to
that time he had passed many ; years there
as the representative of the Government.
one time he knew every- Indian man,
woman and childâ on\ the 'reservation.
When civilization in the valley reached
that point where the Indians'* saw the ad
vantage of having names for their children
Captain Dougherty supplied illustrious
names for either sex with California prodi
gality. It is not uncommon now.to find a
Susie, a Fannie or a Maude among Indian
maidens named in honor of some belle of
army circles. For the noble red man him
self names of great chieftains of the army
have been given liberally. _
7 When -j an Indian once gets â  a name in
this fashion he cannot change it, as it is
entered on the records,' but he is permitted
to exercise the. widest* discrimination in
the original selection of a name. -_â â '
REVENUE VERSUS MARINE
The Cutter Rush Ran Into the
Peter Jehsen During the
Southeaster.
SEPARATED IN CALM WEATHER
Both Vessels Considerably Damaged,
but the Revenue Cutter Suf
fered Most.
One, of the sensational incidents of yes
terday morning's southeaster was the col
lision of the United States revenue cutter
Rush and the Norwegian steamer Peter
Jebsen. The collier had her stem twisted
all out of shape and the damage to the
revenue cutter will not be known until she
is docked for repairs.
There is a certain air of mystery about
the matter that only time will unravel.
The Rush was at anchor off Folsom-street
wharf at 2 a. m. when the squall came up.
She was headed to all points of the com
pass inside of ten minutes, and . finally the
anchor lost its hold and the revenue cutter
went adrift.
It was ebb tide at the time and the ves
sel went scudding down the harbor like a
frightened deer. When oft Lombard
street wharf she narrowly escaped going
into collision with the English ship Sierra
Pedrosa and then the sweep of the tide
headed her out for ; sea. When a little be
low Alcatraz steam was on the boilers and
with sixty pounds of steam showing on
the gauge the Rush began to buck wind
and tide. On her way back she ran foul
of the Jebsen and came within a very
short margin of going to the bottom.
"It was a bitterly cold * night," said
Lieutenant Ballinger. yesterday, "and the
sleet was so thick that it was almost im
t possible to see a boat's length ahead.
When we finally got steam up the Rush
could just held her own against the wind
and tide. Owing to the fact that it is now
the time for spring tides the water runs
like a millrace, and that, coupled with a
75-mile gale, made things lively. We saw
the Jebsen's lights and tried toclear them,
but owing to the driving rain and sleet
misjudged our distance and failed."
"What our damage will amount to will
remain to be seen,' 1 said Captain Hansen
of the collier^ "We are not getting our
cargo out as quickly as possible, and when
the vessel is a few feet more out of the
water we will hold an examination. I
think our repairs can be made without
going on the drydock, as our stem can be j
straightened alongside the wharf. None
of our plates seem to be damaged, so the
repair-? will not take long.''
When the Rush struck the Peter Jebsen
the latter was riding at one anchor. Had
; the revenue cutter struck her fairly amid
ships the latter would undoubtedly have
gone down. As it was, she lost two of her
boats, had her davits bent up and twisted,
and was so badly damaged on her star
board side that eight or ten pianks will
have to be replaced. >
The report of the Merchants Exchange
reporter, who was on the spot, is as fol
lows:
March 2, at 3 a. m., the United States steamer
! Richard Rush, lying off Folsom street at an
| chor, dragged in . a heavy southeast wind and
I drifted down the bay to Powell-street wharf,
i where she fouled the Norwegian steamer Peter
Jebsen, twisting the Jebsen's stem badly, and
I carried away one of her own boats and did con
| siderable other damage to herself.
THE TENANTS` BUILDINGS.
End of the Suit Over the Lin
coln School Prop*
erty.
Judge Seawell Has Decided That the
City Owns the Land but Not
the Improvements.
The tenants of the Lincoln School lot on
Fifth and Market streets can do as they
please with their buildings. Judge Sea
well has so decided in an agreed case sub
mitted to him some days ago.
v. The question arose over the uncertainty
as to who owned the buildings at the ex
piration of the lease-â the City or the
lessees. < It v was stipulated in the adver
tisement . for bids that the lessee should
remove the buildings at the expiration of
his lease, but the lease itself did not con
tain that provision. Under this omission
the; City claimed the improvements. In ;
rendering his opinion Judge Seawell stated
the law as follows: *, " -
At the t.me when the act was passed, the
land was vacant laud uft improved. . No leases
could be made for less than the sum specified
in the act. It; may well be assumed ; that in
fixing: a minimum rate the Legislature in
tended that the rent should? represent the full
.value of the land: without 'any improvements,
as the tenants could* not make any profitable
use of the land, without the erection of build
ings. 'It must have been contemplated that the
board \ should have i power i to ' deal with f con-;
ditions which necessarily arose when leases
were to be made. - '
In recognizing the right of the lessees to re
''3SiP-aÂ»--jT*w_i__L_- > â afcgaH-^-teygsaafv .*â¢â¢â 
move their improvements at the expiration of
their terms, the board was not disposing of
any property which}. belonged to ;-. the * City.
It merely consented that * the" lessees should
not lose the property which. they should them
selves create, and' without which it would be
impossible for them to make any profitable
use of the land. The stipulation as to Improve
ments, was not made after: they had become
fixtures and ~ the property of . the City and
County. It was made before the bids were
made tor the purpose of obtaining the highest
rent possible. * 'â '-
By this construction the City, at the expira
tion of the term, receives back all that it owned
at the time when the leases- were made, and
this is all that it snonld receive. By the other
construction, for which the Board of Educa
tion contends, the tenants will have paid to
the City not only this pecuniary rent with
which they, were charged, but also the valua
ble improvements for which the City has given
no equivalent.
The suit was brought to - prevent the
tenants from tearing the buildings down.
TRIAL OF DANIELS;
The Lieutenant of the Bear Will at
Once Be Examined Before the â 
Court-Martial.
' Now that the charges of inebriety against
Captain Hea.ly of the revenue cutter Bear
have been fully inquired into and the find
ings of the court-martial have en for
warded to Washington, it is expected that
the examination of Lieutenant Daniels
will at once follow. Daniels is the young
man who has been foremost in the fight
against his old commander. The charges
that have been brought against him in-
elude drunkenness and insubordination.
It is also stated that a still graver accusa
tion will be entered against the lieutenant,
whose ambition.'it is alleged,* seems to
have thwarted his better judgment.
Captain Heaiy is living quietly at Sau
salito. Nothing will be known of the find
ings of the court until the result has been
finally made public by the authorities at
Washington. It is generally believed,
however, that the judgment of the court
has been favorable to Captain Healy.
MRS. MATHESON RESIGNS
Mrs. J. W. Bruner's Charges of
Neglect of Duty the
Cause. â¢
Dr. Weil's Accuser Has Turned Her
Attention to the Magdalen
Asylum.
Crimination, explanation and resigna
tion. .. .';'.'. . . .
This was the story of yesterday's meet
ing of the Woman's Federation. Mrs.
Jane .W. Kroner, who recently had &
passage-at-arms with Dr. Weil of the
Receiving - Hospital, precipitated the
trouble by submitting a report of the visit
of the committee on public institutions to
the Magdalen Asylum. She had not waited
for a notification from the chairman of the
committee, Mrs. Florence Percy Mathe
son, before making the investigation. In
defense of such procedure she alleged that
that lady had never discharged her- duties
as chairman of the committee, and de
manded why she had not.
Mrs.; Matheson was on her feet in a
moment, but checked her impulse to an
swer the charge in the tone and manner
employed by the accuser. "Shall I?" she
.said, looking inquiringly toward the presi
dent. ''Say nothing that will cause hard
feelings," said Mrs. French deprecatingry,
and' Mrs. Matheson .took her seat. She
wrote her resignation as a member of the
committee, and asked a consideration of it
at once. It was accepted.
; Mrs. French immediately, called Mrs.
Bruner's attention to the requirements of
courtesy in such i a case, but the lady
talked on. ;â¢' '
In opposition to the expressed wish of
the president and some of the conservative
member, of the i federation j Mrs. , Bruner
advocated that the City commit the crimi
nals, hitherto sent; to the Magdalen Asy
lum to the Whittier Reform School, her
claim being that it would be a savins to
the State of $4 a month per capita. Mrs.
French said it was in direct opposition to
her wish that only public ;i institutions be
investigated, but her veto was ignored.
A communication from the Board of
Health, stating that that body would give
a committee from the ; federation â  an ; au
dience at 11:30 a. M. to-morrow, was read. I
The committee will present its reasons for |
the much-criticized action' concerning the
Receiving Hospital at that time.
: Mrs. French' called attention to the fact
that the side-entrance ordinance had been
enforced in the case of Coleman, a saloon
keeper. She ' requested that I the proper
committees * co-operate j with y St. Luke's
Medical Society in its work of aiding the
poor. She f advised that * all ladies who ;
could do so should be in attendance when

THE DONAHUE FOUNTAIN.
May Surpass in Artistic Merit
the Phelan Monu
ment.
IN HONOR OF MECHANICS.
In Selecting a Design Competition
of Artists Will Be
Invited. ,
Among the provisions of the will of J.
Mervyn Donahue is one that a fountain,
to cost $25,000, shall be erected at the in
tersection of Battery. Bush and Market
streets. It was the idea of the testator that
the - fountain should be dedicated to the
mechanics of San Francisco.
The executors of the estate, Peter Mc-
Glynn and J. F. Burgin, have long been
anxious to execute the desire of the testa
tor in this regard, but litigation has pre
vented a final settlement of the affairs of
the estate and thus precluded action. A
decision of the Superior Court was re
cently rendered which held in effect that
the estate was not liable for certain claims
presented by the Seligmans of New York.
Should there be no appeal from the judg
ment of tne Superior Court to the Supreme
Court, the residue of the estate will be dis
tributed and the $25,000 be set apart for
building the fountain. >>:?
The executors will take particular pride
in fulfilling this obligation of the trust
imposed upon them. They appreciate the
fact that Mervyn Donahue desired a beau
tiful fountain to be erected, which should
stand as a monument expressing the kind
ness which he and his father entertained
for the mechanics of this City. The testa
tor, it is well known, desired that the
fountain should be a work of art and an
ornament of San Francisco. With these
impressions in mind, the executors will
open competition for designs and offer
such inducements for a design of recog
nized merit and beauty that leading artists
will be tempted to com pete for first honors.
It is acknowledged that the design of the
Admission Fountain, to be erected by
James D. Phelan, is a work of art, yet this
monument, it is claimed, will be surpassed
in grace and beauty by the Donahue
fountain. â  . .
Messrs. McGlynn and Burgin are of course
anxious to begin work at once. Should an
appeal be taken to the Superior Court a
final decision would not be reached before
July next. __________________
DR. GHIESLIN DEAD.
He Was 63 Tears Old, Was Never Mar
ried and Left an Estate Worth
9400,000.
Dr. J. T. Ghieslin, one of the early pio
neers of Portland, Or., but who has lived
at the Occidental Hotel for a dozen
years, died at the hotel early yesterday
morning. He was 63 years old.
The doctor and the late Dr." Basil Xorris,
who also lived at the hotel, were long in
timate friends. Both had been surgeons
in the army, were about the same age and
of very similar tastes. When Dr. Norris
died, about a month ago, Dr. Ghieslintook
to his bed in a moody way. It was a hard
blow on him. There was at no time a well
defined ailment, except the asthma, which
had affected him for many years, and
.which had caused the change of his resi
dence from Portland. \
Or Saturday last, however, he sustained
a slight paralytic shock. He passed away
like one asleep.. Dr. Dorr was in attend
ance on him. : .'
The doctor's estate is said. to be worth
$400,000. It consists almost entirely of real
estate- and : buildings in ; Portland. The
money the doctor made from his profes
sion in his young days he invested there,
and the rise in values made him rich. He
was never married. He has a nephew in
the East of whom he was very fond, and it
is supposed he will get tbe bulk of the
property. The will is as yet unopened.
, The body will be sent to Portland to
morrow by the steamer State of California
for burial. : ."*
Ferry Depot Contracts.
The ; case of Bateman against the Controller
to compel the payment of a demand for work
done under contracts for the new ferry depot
was argued before the Supreme Court yester
day. It was a question of which law the Har
bor Commissioners were working under when
they awarded the contracts,; and so Bateman
did $44 worth of work in order to test the
matter. The questions involved are technical
ones relating to the procedure in advertising
for and â  allowing bids. The case was sub

Alcoholic Poisoning.
John J. Tittle, saloon-keeper, 118 Ellis street,
was taken to the Receiving Hospital yester

Tittle recently purchased an -interest in the
saloon for $800, but business was dull and he
sold out for $100 a few days ago.

ALL TO STAND
BY THE ARMY!
The Advice of Ballington
Booth to Brigadier
Keppel.
CAPTAINS WILL CONFER.
â¢ The Deposed General May Organ
ize a New Evangelical
Society.
IT WAS A FAMILY QTJABBEL.
A Belief That the Salvation Soldiers
Will Not Desertâ Their
Solemn Oath.
'. . The various posts of the Salvation Army
are more or less agitated over the inter
national troubles in the army at this time,
but a? yet there have been no official utter
ances made by the leaders and officers of
the army in this City, and there is a good
deal of uncertainty as to the position that
the deposed American commander, Bal
lington Booth, occupies just at present.
"We are not certaiof" said Brigadier
'Keppel, trie head of the army on this
coast, when seen yesterday, "whether
Ballington Booth resigned or whether
he was dismissed; but this I do
know, he was ordered by General
Booth, his father, to leave America, and
he declined to do so, which, according to
army rules, amounts to what might be
called insubordination.
"As the matter stands now, he is no
longer officially recognized, and we do not
take any orders from him, but receive or
ders direct from the headquarters of the
general. What Ballington Booth may
do it is impossible to say, but in a commu
nication to me he says, 'You stand by the
army.' It is possible that he may start
another and different organization to
battle against evil. It will probably be of
an evangelical character and be conducted
â¢without-uniform*, drums and music.
"Should he, however, determine io make |
a call on the country for followers of the
Salvation Army, there might be some in
dividuals or posts that would follow un
der his leadership. Still, I am of the
opinion that few would do that, for every
soldier is bound by a solemn oath to stand
by the army in its war against.evil. Each
soldier cf the army subscribes to the fol
lowing, which is the second paragraph in
the articles of war:
â  Relieving solemnly that the Salvation Army
has been created by God and is sustained and
directed by him, 1 do hereby declare my de
termination by God's help to be a true soldier
of the army till I die.
"This," continued the brigadier-gen
eral, "is a solemn obligation, and I believe
that every man and woman who subscribes
to that oath appreciates its solemnity.
After a foldier has signed it he or she is
required to appear on the platform in pub
lic, when he or she is asked if he or she has
signed the articles of his or her own free
will, and if he or r she has any desire to
withdraw. If the answer is in the affirm
ative the soldier raises his or her hand to
God and renews the declaration.
"There is a principle in the army and
the soldiers swear to stand by it, no matter
what may become of the head, for the
head of the army may die but the army
will continue on in its work. What the posts
in California may do is not known, but from
conversations I have had it is my opinion
that they will stand by the head of the
army, as they are bound under their oath
to do. I noticed a report in the dispatches
from San Jose this morning that the mem
bers of the army there gave a vote of confi
dence to Ballington Booth. That certainly
was not an official action, for that is not
the way we do in the army. It may have
been that by a show of hands the members
may have shown that they are friendly to
Ballington Booth, and it may amount to
no more than that.
-The captain of that post will be in this
City in a day or two, as will be captains
from a number of .other posts, and when
we are all together we may discuss the
situation, and there may be some expres
sion of sentiment.
".Why there was a disruption between
the father and son no one outside of them
selves knows, but it is my opinion that it
is of a family nature which General Booth
will not disclose, preferring to suffer under
the charge of insubordination than expose
family affairs. It must have been of a
serious character when the Commissioner,
Eva Booth, could not effect a reconcilia
tion.
"As I said before, the army no longer
recognizes Ballington Booth* aa an officer,
but the soldiers and the officers all have
the highest regard for him."

Attorney Creswell's Opinion of the
Extension of Green and Lyon
Streets.
The need of the City treasury for con
stant police protection in view of there
cent warning that a raid was intended
was recognized by the Board of , Super
visors yesterday when a resolution direct
* ing the Chief of Police to detail a patrol
man to watch the treasury during business
hours was passed unanimously. Super
"visors Taylor.'Hobbs and Benjamin, com
posing the Finance Committee, recom
mended the passage of the resolution,
which read as follows:
Whereas; The present condition of the City
and County treasury is such that some pre
cautionary safeguards should be thrown around
it, both as* a protection for its officials and for
the citizens doing business within its office;
therefore 89Si<||l|)>ii|_tfilWIIT*Bi< pfOtwafe-":
Resolved, That the Chief of . Police be and is
hereby requested and directed to detail a po
lice officer, whose duty, shall be to perform
.service in the Treasurer's office and be con
stantly in attendance therein during business
- hours. 'â  * _ ' -*. â¢
Supervisor Hughes introduced a resolu
tion that was carried instructing the Su
perintendent of Streets to prevent the un
lawful use of the sidewalks by corporations
x and individuals, and to cause the arrest of
persons violating; the orders of tbe board
in this matter/ '. \ : ."';,â
Mr. Hughes explained his reasons for in
â¢ troducing the resolution by saying thatj
he had been informed > that an electric
light company was puttineup poles on the
sidewalk in front of the Bly the. property
on Market street without authority and in
violation of the ordinance.
The following opinion of City and
County Attorney Cressweli in relation to
the extension of Green and Lyon streets
was read and referred to the Finance Com
mittee: â 'â "â .*.â 
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of San Francisco: 1 am in
receipt of the resolution of the board known
as Resolution No. 13,855 reciting that you
have received a communication from 1 nomas
Magee, A. S. Baldwin and G. H. Umbsen, who
were appointed to appraise the value of the
property in the Miranda Grant necessary for
the extension of Lyon and Green streets, and
requesting mv opinion "as to whether it is
necessary to extend said streets through said
Miranda Grant in order to comply with the
conditions embraced in the act of Congress
passed May 9, 1870, whereby a certain strip of
land adjoining the Presidio Reservation on the
east, 00 feet in width, was relinquished to tin***
City and County." ..â .,â â¢â â 
It is my opinion that it Is necessary to ex
tend Lvon street without a break to, the bay
of San Francisco and to similarly extend to the
easterly line of Lyon street bo extended Broad
way, Vallejo, Green, Union, Filbert, Green
wich. Lombard, Chestnut, Francisco, Bay,
North Point,- Jefferson, Tonquin and Lewis
streets as laid down on the ofricial map of the
City and County of San Francisco before the
grant made in the act of Congress of May 9,
1879, will become complete.

March 2, 1896. City and County Attorney.
The nickel in the slot machine license
ordinance was finally passed. It provides
that the owners of such appliances must
pay a license of $3 per quarter for each
machine.
A petition from the Union for Practical
Progress asking that a special election be
calied for the purpose of submitting to the
electors of the City the proposition of
municipal ownership of water, eas and
electric light plants was referred to the
Finance Committee.
Property-owners on Cherry street, be
tween California and Sacramento, sent in
a protest against the paving of that block,
representing that the work is not neces
sary and that the value of the property
does not warrant the expenditure of sucn
an amount of money as would be necessary
to do the job. The matter was referred to
the Street Committee.
A petition presented by owners of prop
erty on Haight street, between Steinerand
Pierce, asking that the block be accepted
by the City, was referred to the Street
Committee. The owners of the property
represent that the block has been properly
paved, curbed and sewered, and that the
work has been accepted by the Superin
tendent of Streets.
The contract for repaying Folsom street
was finally let to the City Street Improve
ment Company. John* Tuttle was given

streets ana will be known as the Phelan
Fountain. â â 
THE STEVENSON FOUNTAIN
'â¢ Plans to Erect a Better Memo
rial Than Was at First
Intended.
The Committee Will Endeavor to Pro
duce a Monument of Which the
City Will Be Proud. .
The agitation of the Stevenson monu
ment project, following the action of the
Supervisors in rejecting the first design
that was submitted to them, is likely to
result in a better memorial than was at
first proposed.
Few of the San Francisco residents,
even among those interested in art and
literature, seem to have known much
about the matter when the Supervisors
were asked to sanction the placing of a.
fountain at the central point of Portsmouth
square.
The San Francisco contributors to the
fund were outnumbered by the Eastern
people who sent donations to the commit
tee, and it is not believed that such would
have been the case had there been a more
general understanding of the plan. Sub
scription blanks were sent out by the com
mittee, composed of Mrs. Virgil Williams,
Horace G. Piatt and Bruce Porter, and it
was announced that the subscriptions
would be received by Mr. Porter, W. D.
; Armes of the University of California, W.
| K. Vickery, or any of the bookstores.
With the blanks were shown artistic cir
cular letters, one of which is shown here
with:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 1896.
LUCK OF CHARLES LANE.
The 'Fortuna Mine, Recently
Bought, Pronounced a Ver
itable Bonanza.
HAS MANY MILLIONS IN SIGHT.
Three Poor Prospectors Lately Found
ItâA Unique Camp With No
Water in Fifteen Miles.
C. Perkins, who for years has been
connected with the Utica gold mine and
other properties in which Charles Lane
is an owner, as the transporter Â£of
the machinery and other, heavy freight,
has returned here from Fortuna, where he
has been putting a twenty-stamp mill on
La Fortuna mine, recently bought by Mr.
Lane. "
He â¢ says the mine is a gigantic gold
property and estimated by experts to have
at least $2,000,000 in sight. It cost Mr.
_ _ ...â -. r
O. C. PERKINS, WHO HAS RETURNED FROM THE- NEW CAMP OF FORTUNA.
.â.â -â - [Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
Lane but $150,000. He got a bond on it in
December and only a few days ago paid
the money.
"It is undoubtedly one of the greatest
mines in the country," said-Mr. Perkins,
who is at the Grand. "The new camp of
Fortuna is thirty miles northeast of Yuma
and fifteen miles from Blaisdell's station,
on the Southern Pacific. It is right in a
little cove of the mountains, and the wind
has blown away the dust, so that the
ground is as hard as asphaltum.
"The worst of it is that there is no
water there, and there is none within fif
teen miles. Owing to the big find of gold,
however, a town is springing up there.
Already it has three saloons and some
dancehouses, and I hear some more saloons
are going in. I suppose there are about
200 people there now.
"There is big interest in the place. Jim
Keene was out there from New York when
I was there, and Jesse Grant was there
also. Both were there in -. the interest of
mines. â¢â¢;-' '7: .*-.".- -
"La Fortuna, which Mr. Lane bought
for "$150,000 and which has developed so
handsomely, is all the talk everywhere
you go. It" /shows a ledge a little 1 over
twenty feet wide of absolutely free milling
ore. â¢â¢ There are no sulphurets or anything
else.' It is gold simply. .J i '; . -: " -:
"R. M. Straus, the superintendent of the
mine, estimates that tho ore will average
$50 a.ton." He told Â«me this, and said he
didn't want to overestimate it, because he
wanted the * actual * returns to <â  be greater.
He thinks there are by this estimate full y
$2,000,000 in sight. Other experts place the
ore at from $75 to $80 a ton. -
* 'Fifty dollars, -however, Lis enormously
rich; as every one knows. The discovery
was made by a shaft sunk about 200 feel.'
Since then the vein has been crosscut ted
so as to show .' up the ore. This is all the
development work that baa been done,
"At present a new two-compartment
shaft is being sunk. Mr. Lane â is; putting
up a twenty-stamp mill and pumping
works, 'and. is; building a large i reservoir.
The upper grouna improvements will cost
in the neighborhood of $75,000. * The com
pany nas nine claims in all. Some of the
other claims are partially developed. They
show up well.
"Three poor prospectors found the For
tuna. A man named Thompson was one
of them,' and it was at that time called the
Thompson mine. : The name has been
changed^ since. Although the mine > has
millions in sight the prospectors are satis
fied with the money they : cot. One of the
young m en is a German and he is going
back to Germany in a few days.
"The water necessary for. the Fortuna is
being brought from a well two miles from
the Gila River and fifteen miles distant.
It comes up a 600-foot grade in a four-inch
pipe. It takes a pressure of 400 pounds of
steam to tbesauare inch to force it through
the pipe." * ".." .
Mr. Perkins believes Fortuna will be a
great gold camp, and says there is; deep
interest in it in the southern country.

Thomas D. Condon Slips and Falls Under
* : a Geary-Street Car. *
Thomas D. Condon, an insurance solici
tor, living at 128 Tenth street, met with a
serious accident yesterday evening.
He was riding on a Geary-street cable
car, and at Grant avenue jumped off the
front platform while -the car was in mo
tion. He slipped on the wet cobblestones
and fell under the wheels, which passed
over his left leg, below the knee, crushing
it almost into a pulp.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. Weil thought it would be nec
essary to amputate his leg. An effort will,
however, be made to save it if possible.

WARDE CHARMS SOCIETY
The Tragedian Tells the Forum
Club About Shakespeare's
Works.
BRILLIANT CHURCH WEDDING
Miss Altmeyer and J. Jacobi to Be
Married at the Bush-Street
- Temple To-Morrow.
Frederick Warde, the eminent actor, ad
dressed the ladies of the Forum Club yes
terday afternoon in the Maple Hall. of the
Palace Hotel. ~-
The Forum is a fashionable ladies' club.
It was organized . last November, the ob
ject ' being mutual advancement and im
provement. The ladies meet on Monday
afternoons, and - a lecture or reading by
some visiting or local celebrity usually
constitutes the programme.
Mrs. F. L. Whitney, the president of the
club, made a masterstroke when she in
vited Mr. Warde to address the ladies.
The meetings of the Forum are usually
held in the Y. M. C. A. building, but ow
ing to the large number of invitations is
sued for yesterday's lecture it was neces
sary to secure the Maple Hall. .
Some 200 fashionably attired ladies lis
tened attentively to ? the actor's succinct
remarks and testified their esteem and ap
preciation by well-timed applause.
"Shakespeare and His Works" was the
theme chosen by the speaker, and he
treated his subject in a concise, breezy
manner, the charm of which was irresisti
ble.
After a brief review of the poet-actor's
life Warde gave a summary review of some
of the plays, touching principally on
"Hamlet,*' "Henry VIII," "As You Like
It" and "The Merchant of Venice." In
the course of his illustrations he recited
with delicacy and taste "Cardinal Wolse
ley's Farewell," the first soliloquy in
"Hamlet," Portia's speech on "Mercy"
and the "Seven Ages."
Warde concluded his address by an
earnest plea to his audience to read and
study the great master. "Don't let
Shakespeare frighten you," he . said.
"Don't think he is so profound that you
cannot understand him. Shakespeare's
greatest charm is his simplicity, truth and
directness." C a
After the lecture Mrs. F. L. Whitney, in
the name of the ladies of the club," pre
sented the actor with an immense bunch
of La France roses. - ....â¢' *-_'.**, .
A lecture for the benefit of the Woman's
Exchange will be given by Frederick
Warde at Golden Gate Hall to-morrow at
3 ? p. M. Admission 50 cents. Subject,
"Women of Shakespeare."
There is to be a fashionable wedding to

A few days ago the members of the
Italian society were entertained by the
genial officers of the.Cristoforo Colombo
on board the man-of-war, and : if doing as
Romans do means being in Rome -then
officers, crew and guests were thoroughly
at home, and San Francisco Bay was but
a reflection of the Tuscan sea in color and
sound. Gayly dressed visitors arrived and
departed throughout the afternoon, while
sweet strains of Italian opera furnished by
the cruiser's well-trained hand floated over
the waters.
Alceste Barrucchi, chief navigator, and
Vicentini Pietro, assistant navigator, made
themselves particularly agreeable to all,
and will ever be remembered as the merry
hosts by the visiting Italians.

Lund yesterday 'â  received :an official com
munication from the Swedish Minister at
Washington calling . his attention ' to the
fact that Professor Andree would start in
his balloon in July next to attempt to
reach the north pole by that means. The
purpose of ; the communication ; was to ask
the good offices of Consul Lund in spread
ing the news northward, so as to apprise
the natives to be not only on the lookout
for the expedition, but should s the descent
be made among them to treat the voyagers
kindly and render them what aid they
can. ' >..-â â  .. : ~ "â  7^7rid
A Consul Lund immediately sent a copy of
the *: communication '- to Professor George
Davidson, with a notice that he would call
a meeting of I the Geographical Society [\ of
the Pacific, of which Consul Lund is presi
dent. *â  : '..', ; - : â "'â ''. '- -.
The meeting of the society will be held
on Thursday evening, and measures will
be taken for communicating \ with all i the
settlements on the North Pacific Coast and
as far inland as possible." :*
:; Consul Lund is, naturally enough, very
much interested in the polar expedition of
his countrymen. Speaking of the matter
yesterday he said : Â»â¦
"It is unquestionably a wise I precaution
to advise the natives all ; around Arctic
circle, so far ; as 1 it Â« is } possible,' concerning
the character of this expedition. They are
well acquainted with the sight of .ships/
most of them, but if they saw a balloon
droppine down from tne c heavens they
,would probably take tbe occupants for evil
spirits and kill them â although that is not
the -direction, as we understand ; it, that
evil spirits come from. However, the far
- northern â > belief : about spirits may be re
versed as most things are up there." .
./ "Russia, , ; England ': : .'-* and*- the '.'.United
States have been invited to cooperate with
Norway, and Sweden, in so : far as looking
out and taking care of the balloon voy
agers are concernedâ these countries hav
ing possessions bordering on and within
the Arctic circle. -
"Professor And ree's experiment will of
course attract the attention of . the whole
world, as it will be the j first attempt to
reach the pole by means of a balloon a
means that has been so J much discussed
for so many years. *â¢>â ; â '*.-**â 'â 
" Professor Andree 13 a thoroughly scien
tific man, and his undertaking is not.to be
classed with the claptrap sensational
efforts of the average ; aeronaut seeking
advertising. Ido not know enough about
his balloon to describe it, but 1 know
enough about him to be assured that nis
enterprise is thoroughly well considered
and will go out fully* equipped with
scientific and experienced : men to
make the most of what may be seen. The
air currents are to be depended upon, as
the currents of the ocean were depended
upon by Nansen, to carry the balloon over,
the pole. Photographic apparatus will be
an important part of the equipment, and
if the currents carry the voyagers 'as they
expect a valuable lot of pictures will be
brought back. lam not scientific enough
to be able to say as tp the air currents, but
no doubt Professor Andree has equally as
â¢ good authority for believing in a sustained
air current over . the pole as Nansen had
for his theory of the ocean current.
"The voyage will be undertaken in July,
at which time there is . uninterrupted day
light in the far north and every advantage
for making observations. The .; Govern
ment of Sweden is backing enterprise."
Speaking of the Nansen expedition and
the alleged report from Nansen â¢ Mr. Lund
said: /V-'-v : '7 77- '**"â¢
"It is three years since Nansen left. He
was not expected to return before this
time. As his countryman lam interested
and anxious to hear that he is safe and
i that he has made the discovery of the
poleâ -for his own and the honor of the
country. But the reports come from such
widely separated partsâ thousands of
miles of icebound regions lying between
that to me the' story does not stem to hang
together. I am afraid it is not true. As
to the Jeannette relics found in Green
land, upon which so much stress was laid
to carry the theory of the ocean currents,
upon which Nansen depended, I am still
convinced of their bona-fi.de character.
There can be no mistake a^oout them. The
meeting of the Geographical Society called
for Thursday evening may be an interest
ing one.'.'
PREACHER BARTON.
He Deserts' His Wife for Unknown Fields
of Labor, Leaving Her Des
titute.
"Rev." John D. Barton, a roving
preacher, Gospel mission leader, Gos
pel Army officer and a very itinerant reli
gious person in general, has deserted his
wife, leaving her destitute at 16 Dale street,
and has gone to fill a pulpit unknown.
According to Mrs. Barton's tearful plaint
he is a carpenter and builder,, but works
more at prayer on the street corners and
.telling what a pious life has done for him
than at supporting his family. She mar
ried him in Portland five years ago, and
during that time he - has been proving to
her that he was fit to wear the mantle of
Ananias.'/ She says he tooK her money out
of her purse in her absence from the house,
took her $12 clock away and sold it for the
benefit -of the Gospel Mission cause, and
when he wrapped his ministerial robes
j around him for new and unknown fields of
I labor he took the bed-clothing from their
only bed.
If the poor woman's story contains a
fraction of truth, this preaching fraud
would seem a fit person to shun as some
thing j unwholesome and - unclean. He is
accompanied by his 16-year-old daughter
Lizzie and a Mrs. Minnie Sole. ' ;'*

I -u-ca-s Hills, boDw___ Ca., c*%IN DEFENSE OF
PASTOR BROWN.
His Statement Promises to
Be Extremely Sen
sational.
MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED
Declares That He Is Being Per
secuted by a Man Worth
Millions.
THE COUNCIL MEETS TO-DAY.
Mrs. Cooper Has Three Important
Witnesses in Reserve â Mrs.
Stockton Indorsed.
The ecclesiastical council will resume
the hearing of testimony in the case of Dr.
Charles 0. Brown this afternoon at 2
o'clock. If the programme as arranged
by the committee on charges at a meeting
yesterday is carried out Mattie Overman
will be the first witness placed on the
stand.
It is said, however, that a strong effort
Is being made by Dr. Brown and his friends
to postpone the cross-examination of this
all-important person as long as possible.
The committee having this matter in
charge holds that a witness should com
plete his or her story, subject, of course,
to recall at any time by either side.
Judge Advocate Woodhams.who is merely
an advisory member of the council, is dis
posed to allow the defense all the latitude
desired in presenting its side of the case.
While there is no distinct clash between
the judge advocate and the council, there
is a disposition on the part of the latter to
have the case presented more systematic
ally in the future.
There are rumors afloat to the effect that I
before the week is ended there will be mat
ters laid before judges of Dr. Brown which
will eclipse anything yet presented for the J
consideration of that body.
Mrs. Cooper has three witnesses in re
serve, and their testimony, she declared
last night, would destroy the confidence of
the pastor's stanchest friends, who have
hitherto believed in the reverend gentle-,
man's innocence.
"To give out this testimony now," said
Mrs. Cooper, "would be to put the defense
in a position to manufacture a rebuttal.
There are many people who could come
forward and tell some very damaging
things against Dr. Brown, but they have a
wholesome and well-grounded fear of the
reverend gentleman's brutal and unmanly
way of conducting the cross-examination.
"There is one witness, however, who is
not afraid to face Dr. Brown. I have an
idea that when this story is told there will
be very few questions asked except by
members of the council.
"I have just received a letter from Dr.
Chase of Port Anceles which proves how
groundless were the charges made against
voor. Mrs. Stockton. This letter is as fol
low 3f iQgpBKH&gSMI
Sonoma, Cal.. Feb. 29.
My Dear Mrs. Cooper: I was very much sur
prised to read in recent reports of the trial of
Dr. Blown the charges he made against* the
character of Mrs. Stockton. If Dr. Brown is not
misinformed this is all a revelation tome. I
lived in Port Angeles all the time Mrs. Stockton
did, and her having ruined homes, etc., is all
new to me. I do think she was at times frivo
lous and perhaps indiscreet, -but as to
these grave crimes 1 certainly know noth
ing of them. It really must be that Dr.
Brown has been deceived. It is not likely
that anything I can say or do will be of
service in this sad affair, but I write this
personally to you in the hope that the woman
you are trying to befriend is not as bad as she
â¢ is represented to be. I know of several facts
in her favor which i would tell you could I see
you; but what matters the past if she is be
ginning anew? She did work hard. She bad
many temptations and queer characters to deal
with. I have a number of letters from her
since this trouble and have an interest in her
such as no other could have, as I have her lit
tle one. Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Colyn Chase.
It is impossible at this time to determine
when the case for and against Dr. Brown
will be finally closed and the council asked
to render a verdict. The cross-examina
tion of Miss Overman will probably con
â¢ sume a day. Mrs. Davidson has promised
to appear when wanted and her cross
examination will require a day if not
more. Then the accused pastor must of
necessity give a statement, in which must
be embodied all the details of the charges
against him, which in a^eneral way may
be said to have begun when he assumed
the pastorate of the First Congregational
Church. ;
In addition to the testimony and cross
examination of the three most important
witnesses in the celebrated case, James
Mason has yet to support his charge of in
timidation." This will be followed by evi
â "Mence in rebuttal, at which time Mrs.
'"Cooper declares she will produce the sen
sation of the trial. From present indica-'
fejtions the council will require at least eight
days to conclude its investigations.
The statement of Dr. Brown, made under
. oath, promises to be almost as sensational
as that of his alleged co-partner .in crime,
Miss Overman. He will enter a general
denial of all the accusations made against
him, and follow this up by declaring that
he is the victim' of a foul plot, on which
Miss. Overman in her story touched but
lightly. / â 
The reverend gentleman will claim that
be has been persecuted by a man worth
millions, and all because be would not
submit to certain indignities which a
- friend of the millionaijc endeavored to
heap upon him. 'He will declare that
others had a hand in associating his name
unpleasantly r with that of a now prom
inent member of his church. The pastor
will tell all these things and attempt to
support what he says by giving the names
of his alleged persecutors.
Dr. Brown will of course make a vigor
ous assault on the character of Mrs. David
son. He will attempt to show that she is
not only an irresponsible person, but has
since her confinement in prison endeavored
to secure perjured testimony against him.
The pastor will attempt to prove that the
alleged blackmailer under threat of expos
ing the son of Mrs. Walling of Muckilteo,
Wash., who while in her employ embez
zled $200, demanded of , that lady that she
swear to certain things against him.
Mrs. Walling was expected to say under
oath, that while stopping at a Sixth-street,
lodging house, she had seen Dr. Brown
and Miss Overman enter the place, and
securing a room next to* hers, remain for
several hours. Of course the keyhole
figures in the story." Mrs. .Walling, it
. seems, declined to enter into such an ar
rangement, but instead exposed tbe entire j
scheme to Dr. Brown. That gentleman, j
accompanied by Detective Seymour, visited j
a station just across the San Mateo line, one
day last week and then met Mrs. ailing j
and she told how she had suffered at Mrs.
-Davidson's hands, of the threat, and last
of the advice of a Seattle attorney, -that
she tell Dr. Brown the whole story. The
accused pastor will present this in his de
: fense and will be supported by Detective
Seymour and Mrs. Brown. This lady will
also give a general statement covering the
' case as she knows it. *Â» : "â *.' - â 
The committee on charges will meet to
day at 1 oclock. An hour later .. the coun- J
cil will convene, Miss Overman being prob
ably the first witness called. . . â  .
MATTIE MUST TESTIFY.
She Has Been Subpenaed, With Mrs.
Tunnell'and Dr. Brown, for the
Davidson Case.
The troubles of Miss Overman have no
more than commenced, for her peculiar
story told before the council in the Brown
trial must be repeated in the Superior
Court, and this time under an oath, to vio
late which is perjury. She is wanted as a
witness in the case against Mrs. Davidson,
and a subpena has been Issued for her.
Subpenas are also out for Dr. Brown and
Mrs. Tunnell. and all at the request of
George A. Knight, Mrs. Davidson's attor-
ney. * / 'â â  - fr;rmm 7?7P
it is thought by the defense in the Da
vidson case v that Miss Overman's testi
mony before the council would be valuable
if repeated in court, and the evidence of
the others also is wanted for the defense,
as there is much Mrs. Tunnel! and Dr.
Brown can tell, Knight thinks, which will
help, rather than harm, bis client's cause. I
He has not heard the stories of any of i
these witnesses except through the papers,
but he is afraid they will all vanish when
the Davidson case conies to trial, so to j
prevent any attempt at emigration sub- j
penas were asked for, and by this time j
have probably been served on the three i
most important witnesses.
Mrs. Davidson's bail has been reduced I
from $5000 to $3000 by order of Judge I
Bahrs. before whom the charge against ;
her will be tried. Knight appeared in
court yesterday and made a motion for a I
reduction of the amount, and, the District i
Attorney consenting, the order was mads.

night and ordered a 10-cent meal. When
he went to the counter to settle he found
he had only a nickel, so he bolted out of

him yelling "Stop thief !"
Devine ran into Oak street, hotly pur
sued by McPhee and a crowd who had
been attracted by the cries of "Stop thief."
Policeman O'Connell joined in the chase
and called upon Devine to stop, but he
continued on his way. O'Connell tired a
shot to intimidate him, but it had the ef
fect of increasing his speed, i'evine had
just turned into Gough street when he ran
into the arms of Policeman Brownlee. He
was taken to the City Prison and charged
with defrauding an innkeeper.
DISOBEYED NAPOLEON.
Admiral Brulx'B Bold Stand at Bou
logne.
It was not often that Napoleon merited
the disobedience of his officers and the
condemnation of his soldiers, but Con
stant, in his memoirs, describes an occur
rence that took place while the army and
fleet were quartered at Boulogne. It was,
as he gives it, a melancholy example of
the Emperor's obstinacy. One morning,
when he was setting out . for his usual
ride, he left orders that the vessels form
ing the line of blockade should leave
their positions, - as, on returning, he in-;
tended to review them in open sea. When
this order was reported to Admiral Bruix
he replied that; the review could not take
place that day, and no preparations were
made. As the Emperor's will was' law,
his reception of the admiral's answer and
the inattention paid to his order was an
angry one.
The admiral was summoned to Napoleon's
presence, and a terrible ; scene followed: "Mr.
Admiral," said the Emperor, in an agitated
voice, "why have you not executed my or
ders?" "Sire," replied Admiral Bruix, "there
is a horrible tempest brewing. Your Majesty
can see It as well as I can. Do you wish to ex
pose the lives of so many brave fellows with
out necessity I"- "Sir," replied the Emperor,
more and more irritated, "I gave orders; once
more, why have you not executed them ? The
consequences concern me alone. Obey 1" "Sire,
I will not obey." "Sir, you ore insolent!" and
the Emperor, who still held his riding-whip In
his hand, advanced toward the admiral with
a threatening gesture. '
Admiral Bruix drew back a step and laid his
hand on the hilt of his sword. "Sire," he said,
turning pale, "take care!" The Emperor, mo
tionless for a time, his hand raised, fixed his
eyes on the admiral, who, on his side, main
tained his terrible attitude. At last the Em
peror threw his whip on the ground. M. Bruix
let go the hilt of his sword, and with uncov
ered head awaited the result.
"Rear-Admiral Magon," said .the Emperor,
"you will have the movement I ordered ex
ecuted on the instant. As to you, sir," contin
ued he, bringing his glance back to Admiral
Bruix, "you will leave Boulogne within twen
ty-four hours, and retire to Holland. : Go!"
The maneuver was executed by the less
courageous Magon, but hardly had the
first steps been taken when the tempest
burst. The ships were scattered ; by the
wind and in a few moments more than
twenty gunboats, crowded with soldiers
and sailors, were cast ashore. The Em
peror tried to go to their aid in a lifeboat,
but he was nearly drowned and ; was
obliged to return, although his example ;
sent to the rescue those who crowded the
shore.' They could not accomplish much, j
and 200 corpses thrown on the beach /next
day were the Impressive results of that
day's work. :\7:7.-.::7- ;

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 3, J 896.
ART LIKE A TURKISH RUG
Keith Sells a Masterpiece; of
His Brush to Timothy
Hopkins.
*.
IS BEAUTIFUL UPSIDE-DOWN, j
A Picture Whose Coloring Is What !
Strikes Admiration in the
Beholders.
William Keith has been experimenting
lately in combinations of color in his can- i
vases that recall the old masters, and he!
has invented an entirely new and original j
way of -securing chromatic effects by dab- i
bing two freshly painted pictures together |
and jumping on them to knead the colors, j
As a reward for all this enterprise and
devotion to art Mr. Keith is selling off his :
pictures in a way that excites the envy
and admiration of people who were at first
inclined to scoff at pictures being
produced with the feet. Even ". Col- ]
lis P. Huntington was induced to !
part with some of his (hard-earned !
eheckels when he saw the art Keith was |
producing, and now the painter has just '
sold three of his newest pictures to Timo
thy Hopkins for a good, fat sum.
One of the pictures that Mr. Hopkins has i
just made his is considered by Keith the j
best thing he ever painted. The worK is
called "Sunshine and Shadow," and one
of its great attractions is that whichever
way you bold it up the picture is equally
beautiful to the connoisseur.
"It is like a Turkish rug," said Mr.
Keith as he viewed his handiwork, and
saw that it was good. "The beauty of this
picture lies in its combinations of colors.
hook at it that way up, there's a color
scheme that I might labor for week 3 and
not get again. The thing is like a Con
stableâ leaves so much to the imagina
tion." ; -â â¢'-.â ":'â¢.-'-â ..". .. .
As the light fell on "Sunshine and
Shadow," one yaw that it represented a
stretch of country at the edge of a forest,
with a path beside a meandering stream,
that seemed to lead right into the picture.
The coloring was somberly magnificent,
and made one think of the antique masters
that have been seasoned by age.
"Now look at it that way," said Keith,
deftly turning the picture upside down.
"The sky looks like a lake with the forest
mirrored in it; but pshaw! that's not the
charm of the picture.it is the coloring.
The thing is a rug, a Turkish rug,. not
like that," and the artist indicated a
Japanese rug that Jay at his feet; "but like
that," and he turned his attention to a
magnificent prayer rug that is one of the
glories of the studio.
"I have been turning my attention," he
continued, "to getting into my canvases as
many combinations of colors; a3 nature
uses. Not long ago I was painting a sun
rise, and when I got up the next morning
bless me if nature was not trying to do the
same thing with the same colors. I told
that to Professor Muir, and the sort of look
came over his face that Carlisle wore when
he had a bad attack of indigestion; but it
is true all the same." .;^- ;< . ;*.
Another of the pictures that Timothy
Hopkins has bought is called "The Noc
turne." The artist says he wanted to
throw in as much poetry as possible with
his paintings, and he thinks Nocturne is
the most poetical way of describing an
evening scene. "The Nocturne" shows a
California meadow, well wooded, with
cattle grazing beside a stream. The sun
is setting behind a bank of clouds, and the
coloring of the picture is in cool grays and
greens, which bear no resemblance to a
Turkish rug.
The third of Timothy Hopkin's acquisi
tions bears the poetical name of "The
Golden Hour." It is a picture that one
seems to see right into, as the sun sets in
a golden haze behind clumps of California
oaks. ,-â  :\-A"
just at present William Keith is so
much absorbed in painting a new picture
that he has scarcely time to rejoice in his
good fortune in disposing of three of his
canvases at one stroke to a railroad mag

RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND PROGRESS
An Epitome of Sermons of the Week
Throughout the Land.
Following is a summary of the principal
seimons recently delivered; in the United
States and Canada by .the leading ; clergy
men;, priests, prelates, religious teachers
and professors of the; Christian faith. In
every instance the full text has been care
fully read and abbreviated:
CHURCH MUSIC / - '.'
An unsinging church is : like a face without
expression, like a lamp without light.â Rev. C.
C. Hall, Presbyterian, Brooklyn, N.Y.
EQUALITY. >
All men were ; created { equal in the eyes of
God, and they all have an equal chance of ob
taining eternal salvation.â Rev." Joseph Keelty,
Catholic, Columbus, Ohio.
V, THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.
Can any good moral reason be given for the
liquor traffic? Can 'any one say a good thing
for it as regards morality,: law and order or pa
triotism?â Rev. J.- H. Mac Donald, Methodist,
Newport, R. I. . , ' ; *â 
AFTER DEATH. "". 'â 
When a man dies he dies and remains dead
until he is resurrected. Adveutists do not be
Heve in the spirit that goes roaming off into
space.â Elder Tait, Seventh-day Adventist,
Battle Creek, Mich. -
' GOOD MANNERS.:
i Manners should be to morals what "the. per
i fume is to ; the flower. True , refinement of
manner flows from nobility? of soul. Manner
' is the fixed expression of civilization, not its
measure.â Rabbi Philipson, Hebrew, Cincin
-1 naif) Ohio.
SACRIFICE.
The man who loves a cause best is he who
has sacrificed most for it, and the most patri
otic among citizens are those who have lost a
limb on the battle-field.â Rev. \V. R. Laird,
Presbyterian, Westchester. Pa.
, SPIRITUALISM ET AX.
One of the greatest dangers of the present
day is the people seeking alter some novelty in
doctrine such as spiritualism. What is needed
in the church to-day is contentment with god
liness.âRev. E. M. Wood, Methodist, Alle
ghany, Pa.
PAST LIVING.
The times are too fast, they require too much
money, and the poor have to struggle too hard
to live. The rich set the pace, the middle class
follow and the poor live in dissatisfaction.â
Rev. XV. W. West, Baptist, Pittsburg, Pa.
. 'â . THE AWAKENED SOUL.
The first feeling of the awakened soul is one
of fear. The eyes are opened to see the ' great
ness of their sins. . They have been so accus
tomed to look upon their sins as such insig
nificant things. â Rev. W. H. Stubblebine,
Scranton, Pa. --" *â *â¢--?*
SUNDAY.
Rest one day in every week is necessary for
man, beast and machinery. Six days are
enough to devote to secular pursuits, and one
day is not too much to be given to mental and
spiritual development.â Rev. G. P. Rutledge,
Norfolk, Va. ->*
NATIONAL SINS.
God punishes sin in nations as In individ
uals. National sins bring national calamities.
"Righteousness exalteth a nation." The na
tion must be "established in righteousness,"
or it will not be established at all.â E.
Humphries, Methodist, New Bedford, Mass.
MARRIAGE LAWS.
God has his laws about marriage and the re
lations of the family. The State has its laws
also. Breaking a State law is one thing, but
violating the Christian law; is a much more
serious consideration. Divine law declares
for one lifelong union of i one man and one .
woman, for mutual improvement, uplifting of ,
character, discipline and obedience to divine
will. â Bishop Hall (Episcopalian), Woon
socket, R. I. . - .
RELIGION FOR THE MASSES.
Christianity is a religion for the millionsâ
for the masses. All have sinned and all need
the gospel of redemption. Woe to any church
that degenerates into a social club and caters
only to her own pewholders.â Rev. C.Lt. Jones,
Baptist, Louisville,- Ky. ; * ';
PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY. ; r.: : 7\y'7
It is of little use to try and teach a man about
the Bible and Christ and God when his stomach
is empty or he is tiering from the cold. The
human heart must be touched where it is most
vulnerable.â Rev. William Rainsford, Episco
palian, Cincinnati. Ohio. " ' -'â !--.
DOCTRINE.
To live on doctrine is like feeding a hungry
man on the formula of a beefsteak. Catechisms
and theologies must be made into the bread of
life if the soul would feed on them.â A. J.
Nelson, Methodist, San Rafael, Cal.
PROGRESS. .j-V- s;,- -* * !
The church must encourage new learning. It
must foster investigation. Verily we stand
upon the threshold of a vast temple of scien- :
tific knowledge rising all around us. The
church must be lively if it keeps abreast of the
march of modern thought.â Rev. A. J. Can
field. Universalist, Chicago, 111.
CONFIDENCE.
We are living in hard times. The experts In
finance tell us, and the recent bond sale justi
fies the view, that these hard times arise, not
from lack of money, but from lack of confi
dence. Without confidence credit is impos
sible, and without credit business dissolves.â
Rev. Dr. Uiden, Baptist, Richmond, Va.
MOTHERHOOD.
Motherhood is woman's truest glory. What
ever other rights woman may attain, none will
will throw around her the luster which attends
motherhood. Yet how many there are who
discount motherhood. The imperative need of
the hour is a revival of motherhood in its
truest, highest and -noblest sense.â Rev. Leon
Sonfield, Episcopalian, Galveston, Tex.
SOCIAL CONDITIONS. ~ â¢"
To develop men we must have more than the
bare necessities of life. Our race is dying out
atthe top and being renewed from the bottom.
The liquor-drinking classes barely live, vet the
race goes on ; while - the wealthier "society
dwindles down, leaving but few heirs.â Rev. J.
H. Mac Donald. Methodist, Newport. R. I.
-.* ;' FUTURE PUNISHMENT.
The Universalist Church believes in hell In
punishment, both here and in the world to
come. There are not ministers nor theologies
enough*' in all the world â - to "â¢ disguise,
to .* disprove the : self-evident fact that
every violated law will bring its penalty; that
whatsoever a man ' soweth that shall 'he also
reap.â Rev. Albert Hammott, Universalist,
Brockton, Mass. -
' THE JAPANESE. . ".., '-" .'V*
All the i virtues of mankind existed before
Christianism was born, and they exist largely
and vitally to-day In lands where it is un
known. In the 30,000,000; Japanese there is
found more humanity, more charity, more in
tegrity, more sweetness of life without the gos
pel than 'in any 30,000,000 of Christendom
with the gospel.â Rev. Dr. Wheelock, Unitar
ian, Austin, Tex. ' ââ¢ "â¢'
PUBLIC BCHOOLS.
The public school is the inheritance of ; the
j people, and within its .walls no word or prac
tice should be uttered or performed; that can
wound 'the religious susceptibilities of - any
child who attends it. To act in ; any other
spirt is unjust, un-American and
seditious, inasmuch as it tends to breed secta
rian strife.â Rabbi J. L. Levy (Hebrew), Phila
delphia, Pa. 'â ..-â¢*. : S-v; .
EVOLUTION.
The Garden of Eden, 'Adam: and. Eve, the
serpent, the fall';; what is all this but poetry,
the product ;of uniformed imagination? -, We
now know that the human race did not begin
.perfect, and then*; descend into a state of sin
and brutality and utter misery, but that it has
climbed upward from the lowest manifesta
tions of life to .the civilization of which we
now boast.â Rev. ' D. M. Wilson, Unitarian.
Westerly, R. I. :â¢;->â.".;â : . .-.,;;â  .-.- ;â¢ -*
..* : SPIRITUAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
The human : soul ;is the tablet *on which the
image of Jesus is to be photographed, as the
sensitive plate ;' must be developed in 'the
chemical baths before the ima_e appears, so
our hearts must be made cleanâ cleansed: by
his blood and anuoiutcd by the grace of God.
Light is essential : in the physical , process.
So sin': the spiritual portrait ' there must bo
plenty of light.â Rev. M. A. Head,: Methodist,
Cleveland, Onio.* * *../â¢â 
...; SCIENCE AND THE CHURCH.
: Under the * : guidanco ; ; of ; the; church the
whole universe has joined in tne worship of
the true God. v The church knew that human
science was the handmaid of | faith; and , there
is no branch of art or j science 5 that does not
aid her mission. All great scientists, with a
few exceptions, have been deeply ; religious.
The church has always been to science a kind
and helpful friend.â Rev. Father Boody, Cath
olic, Cambridge, Mass. , Â â -â .:*
. .;/*: LIBERAL RELIGION. "â ''.*â  â ; '/:â *â¢ ."" '7
:; . A liberal in '; religion is * one who 'â¢ keeps his
heart and mind open to every appearance of '
truth and beauty, who expects new light and
welcomes larger* vision. : Thus he i* the man of
progress, because," while remaining loyal to
the truth he has, he looks ever for new truth,
believing that the universe of 'God is not yet
exhausted; but that there are great reservoirs
of truth and life to be drawn upon for human
needs.â Rev. O. J.Eairchild, Unitarian, Spo
kane, Wash. â --*gteÂ«*e-*B*'*a*Â«Bf3tei^^
THE GOD-IDEA. ,
There is a vast difference between the God
idea and the idea of God. The God-idea has
ever existed in the mind of humanity, and the
Idea of God has ; constantly changed as man
has progressed I from savagery to civilization.
The God-idea is a fundamental factor in the
mind of the individual, but the idea of God de
pends upon the degree of the intelligence of
the individual.' The God-idea is the highest
possibility of the individual.â Rev. F. E. Mason,
Brooklyn , N. Y. ,
â .*Â»" THE NEW PHOTOGRAPHY.
If Roentgen and Edison can upon their sen
sitive plates photograph ; the inner man, how
much more can he who knows, understands
and controls all the laws and forces of nature !
I think of the Great Eye -that reads every
thought and emotion, and records unerringly
upon tbe sensitive plates of his great Book of
Remembrance human deeds. ? How can. a man
remain impure and: untrue in the light of
modern science, whose rays are focused upon
the fact of God's omniscience and upon the
judgment day?â Rev. L.W. Allen, Presby
terian, Newark, N. J.
:77' : 7-_-:- IDEAS.
: In a physiological sense, the brain rules the
man. It \is the central office âof his
bodily ; functions. Likewise the mind de
termines the moral, spiritual plane of
life. It is a unity and a unifier. We are ruled
by ideas. How a man lives depends on what
ideas are in his mind. Thus a man's belief is
important. It is his master. It is not always
what he subscribes to, but what he thinks, that
determines him. Even the conscience follows
intelligence, and is trained to right activity by
correct ideas.â Rev. 11. P. de Forest, Congrc
gationalist, Detroit, Mich.
TBADE IN AUTOGRAPHS.
Whims of Collectors That Affect . the
Value of Signatures.
A considerable trade in autographs of
celebrated persons is carried on in New
York, though the great international mar
ket for valuable autographs is London.
There are autograph as well as stamp
brokers. The trade in old, rare and valu
able postage stamps is much better sys
tematized than that in autographs, and
fluctuations the price of the latter are,
in consequence, much more general.
Autograph collectors usually secure the
signatures which they seek at private sale,
through the intervention of autograph deal
ers, but occasionally there is a public auc
tion sale, and then a new set of quotations
is established. The prices are invariably
higher in cases of deceased persons, whose
supply of autographs . (except fictitious
posthumous ones, of course) is necessarily
limited. The value put upon signatures
of living persons bY collectors fluctuates
greatly. The autographs of a distinguished
actress or singer, for instance, such as the
late Adelaide "Lillian Neilson, Parepa Rosa
or Pauline Lucca, would be much in de
mand while she was a public favorite, but
the demand for them would, as it has
done,.decrease after her retirement;
- At a public sale of rare and valuable
autographs in London some years ago the
signature of George Washington brought
Â£10, or $50, an autograph of Benjamin
Franklin, Â£6, or $30, and one of Washing
ton Irving, Â£2, or $10. At the same sale
an autograph of Walter Scott brought Â£17,
and an autograph of Robert. Burns Â£18.
The caprice of collectors lof autographs
was shown by the fact that a signature of
George Eliot and one of Queen Elizabeth
brought the same price, Â£11, or. $55.- The
autograph of Lord Nelson brought Â£11,
and of Thackeray Â£6. An- autograph of
Schiller brought Â£6, and of Richelieu, Â£5.
At an American sale of autographs a few
years ago the highest price obtained was
$50 for the signature of - Roger Sherman.
The autograph of Napoleon I brought $31,
that of Thomas Jefferson $6, Andrew
Jackson $5 50, Aaron Burr $7 50, Benjamin
Franklin $22, Patrick Henry $8, James
Madison $5 50 and Davy Crockett (such is
fame) $345. A signature of Washington
at the same sale brought $5. An auto
graph of Benedict Arnold (date 1772) was
quoted a few years ago at $10 and. one of
Martin Van Buren (1847) at $4 50. The
J lain, spirited and striking signature of
John Hancock, first of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence, familiar
to every schoolboy,' is rated among col
lectors at $3, and the signature of Jefferson
Davis, president of the Confederacy, at $4.
James Monroe, who formulated the
Monroe doctrine, does not stand high in
the good graces of autograph hunters, 'or
his signature while President of the United
States sells in â¢ the autograph â  market for
$2. James Buchanan's signature, forty
years later, but probably much rarer, sells
for $4. Three celebrities, whose auto
graphs are - considered, very valuable, by
collectors, are Lord Byron, Robespierre
and Lord Chesterfield. "Sarah Bernhardt's
si-nature in the autograph market may be
secured for $3.â New York Sun. . ".', ..< ..
Cats and Their Way*.
Cats do not take punishment as dogs do ;
their tempers rise, and if struck they are
apt to strike back; but beyond a gentle
cuff to a kitten, now and then, I find a
scolding or an exclamation of rebuke
enough. They are also less intelligent and
forgiving than a dog if unintentionally
kicked or trodden on.' There is no more
beautiful expression in a dog's face than
the look he turps to a friend who has in
voluntarily hurt him, before there is time
to explain; his whole demeanor expresses
the highest magnanimity,* not only the
foregone pardon but the eager desire that
the 'offender shall think no more of the
matter.;. 777.7
In many respects cats are mote like men
and women than dogs are; they have
moods and their nature is complex. A dog
is very much of a piece; he is a good dog
or a bad dog, brave or cowardly, honest or
a sneak; the canine intelligence is much
higher than the feline, but the disposition
is simpler.
Cats are exceeedingly irritable by tem
perament, sensitive to changes of the
weather, to frost, to thunder; they are ex
citable and naturally disposed to bite and
scratch when at play ; there is a curious
tendency in them, as in ill-balanced or
overstrung human beings, to lose their
heads when in high spirits, and the self
command most of them show when full
grown :in resisting these impulses :is a
striking proof of conscious responsibility.
A full - grown pet cat ; scarcely ever
scratches a young child, no matter how
much mauled by it. Besides being irri
table they are moody and subject to de
pression, probably a physical reaction from
the former condition. Princess, though
not a sullen cat, would sometimes forsake
the hearth or verandas and pass days by
herself : on the garden 5 wall ;or under . a
bush, not ill nor out of temper, but out of
spirits, morbid, and wishing for solitude
instead of the sympathy which she always
sought in her real ailments and bereave
ments. .*'*., â¢ >- /
:'.-' Her peculiarities, both of : race and indi
viduality, were remarkably defined, even
when she held them in restraint, but, with
one exception, all the cats I have known
are i captious. i Their i instinct when .' ill or
sad is to be alone, but this is entirely neu
tralized by petting â¢ they become ; as J de
pendent on caresses and sympathy as chil
dren, and much wiser than children when
they are Fills or injured, as they apply for
relief with the most unmistakable sugges-'
tions, sometimes indicating plainly.where
they are in pain and presenting the suffer
ing member for treatment.^ They are not
so patient as dogs in taking medicine or
submitting to surgical care, but show their
recognition of its benefit by coming back
for it under similar circumstances.âTem

FREIGHT WAR
TO THE DEATH
The . Southern Pacific Uses
Its Ax on Through
Rates.
A BIG BATTLE NOW ON.
Transcontinental Lines Pitted
Against the Panama Route
Combination.
HUNTINGTON'S QUEER POSITION
*
He Is Using His Railroad Interests to
Injure His Steamship
Property.
There is no longer any doubt that it is
now war to the death between the South
ern Pacific Company, with its allied trans
continental lines, and the Panama Rail
road Company, with its allied steamship
lines, on the Atlantic and the Pacific.
And the most remarkable feature of this
conflict is that to a very large extent the
same persons have interests in the oppos
ing transportation companies, and the
indication are that it is these very persons
having these now diverse interests who are
instigating or at least responsible for this
anomalous condition of the transporta
tion situation.
When last December C. P. Huntington,
on behalf of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, felt it -expedient to sign the
agreement framed by President Simmons
of the Panama Railroad Company
for a through line between New
York and San Francisco via Pan
ama, it excited considerable surprise,
as this agreement virtually gave the Pan
ama people control of the whole through
freight situation. They not only had the
right to fix the westbound rates, but re
tained the right to control eastbound
rates to such an extent as would insure
this route not less than 4000 tons of freight
a month, provided the Panama steamers
on the Atlantic side have the facilities to
handle such a tonnage.
That the astute president of the South
ern Pacific Company should have thus
placed the key to the whole transconti
nental freight situation in the hands of
those who were at one time the keenest
and most powerful competitors the Pacific
Mail Company and the transcontinental
railroads ever had was as unexpected to
the public as it was -ratifying to the
Panama Railroad Company. In conse
quence, every shipper was curious to
see what this apparent surrender of
Huntington signified in reality.
An increase in rates was of course looked
for, and it came. The figures via the
isthmus route for eastbound freight went
from 35 cents per' 100 pounds to GO cents
per 100 pounds, and those via the all-rail
route advanced from SO cents, per 100
pounds to 75 cents per 100 pounds, making
a difference of $3 per ton between the two
transportation routes.
About two months' operation under
these rates showed that the 53 differential
was insufficient to attract business to the
steamship lines, and February 10 the Pan
ama Railroad Company notified the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company that it must
make the eastbound rates on certain com
modities that could be advantageously
handled by the isthmus route 40 cents
per 100 pounds. After considerable cor
respondence on the matter the Pacific
Mail Company acceded to the request of its
contractual paitner and sent out the fol
lowing circular to shippers on February 28 :
NOTICE.
Change in rates
By the Panama route, San Francisco to New
York.
Pacific Mall Steamship Company, Panama Rail
road Company and Colombian line.
"Until further notice the rate for the above route
on the foUowing commodities. San Francisco to
New York, will be 40 cents pet 100 pounds:
Antimony, asphaltum, beans, boueblack, borax,
brandy, dried fruit, glue, mustard seed.' manga
nese, ore, chrome, peas, . quicksilver, rice, tallow,
canned fruit, barley, wine, canned salmon. -. > -
These rates, while announced on Feb
ruary 28, cannot go into practical effect
until the Bth inst., as the next Pacific Mail
steamer does not leave until that date. '
The Southern Pacific, having had full
knowledge undoubtedly of what was trans-,
piring, were fully prepared when the pub
lic announcement of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company was made to take
such action as would nullify the effect of
these reductions via the Panama route.
Yesterday, accordingly, the Southern
Pacific made a 33 1-3 per cent cut on much
the same commodities as those affected by
the Pacific Mail reductions, the new rates
to go into effect on the 7th inst., just a
day prior to the sailing of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company's steamer for Panama.
These new. rates on the rail lines are as fol
lows :
On antimony, barley, boracic acid, borax,
glue, manganese and chrome ore, dried
peas, quicksilver in flasks, rice, mustard
seed, tallow and wheat, from California
terminal points on the Southern Pacific
Company's lines to New York or New
Orleans, in carloads of 30,000 pounds, 50
cents per 100 pounds.
On beans from the same . California
points to the same Eastern points, 50 cents
per 100 pounds, and from Ventura and
neighboring towns to the same Eastern
points 62% cents per 100 pounds.
On wine, from shipping points in Cali
fornia to New York, New Orleans, Calves
ton and Houston, in carloads of 24,000
pounds. 50 cents per 100 pounds. '
On canned goods from California can
neries to the four Eastern points last
named, in carloads of 30,000 pounds, 50
cents per 100 pounds.
These rates have ail been reduced from
the 75-cent rate, which was put into effect
after the signing of the Panama- Pacific
Mail contract. They make a differential
of but $2 a ton as between the Panama
and the. all-rail route, and in view of the
fact that - experience has shown that as 3
"differential was insufficient to bring busi
ness to the Panama combination, this
latest move can only be interpreted as a
dead set against the isthmus route. -
The next step of the Panama people will
doubtless be to ask the Pacific Mail Com
pany to agree upon a 30-cent rate, which
would make as 4 differential. ' It been
admitted, however, by the representative's
of both the Pacific Mail and the Panama
companies that such a rate is not one that
permits of a profit.
â¢ Just what Huntington expects to accom
plish by thus using his railroad interests
to injure his' Pacific Mail property and in
cidentally, of course, the Panama people,
is as yet a mystery. Knowing ones, how
ever, assert that he is heartily sick of the
contract he signed last December, and is
now. willing and even anxious to have the
Panama people abrogate it. They even go
so far as to say that Huntington expected
to be able to swing the Panama people,
despite the terms of the contract; that he
found he was unable to do so, and is now
desirous of being rid of that alliance. ; ' ;
How he expected to control the Panama
Railroad Company and its Atlantic steam
ship line is pointed out, they claim, ii the
developments of the last few weeks. It
will be remembered that the Panama
people had to run their steamers from
Colon to New York without their quota of
through freight. Complaint was made
to the Pacific Mail Company, and the
latter agreed to make good the failure to
provide the amount of freight called for by
the contract by paying a certain sum . as a
penalty to the Panama Company. While
the latter, under the circumstances, was
forced to "accede to this arrangement, it
made it clearly understood that it did not
propose to be subsidized in this indirect
manner, but would insist on being provided
with its due quota of freight. .
Shippers are much disturbed over the
situation, as a rate war of this magnitude
always results in unsettling the commer
cial situation.

AN ORIENTAL MUSICALE
Girls of the Presbyterian Mis
sion Entertain Their
Visitors.
No Loud Effects Were Attempted aDd
the Music Proved Pleas
ing.
The Presbyterian Mission Home, 920
Sacramento street, was the scene of a*
novel musicale yesterday. All the per
formers were Orientals, who made music
on their native instruments, and also
showed their familiarity with Western
singing and pianoforte playing.
To add local color to the musical effects,
the rooms had been decorated with a good
deal of Oriental bric-a-brac, Japanese- and
Chinese "flags, lanterns and gay flowers.
The American flag was also conspicuously
displayed. A number of girls, ex-pupils of
the home, who have become the wives of
Chinese merchants, were present with
their childien, arrayed in a manner which
Solomon in all his elory might have en
vied. Their appearance, added to the gay
Oriental dresses of the present inmates of
the home, made the rooms seem a blaze of
color and magnificence.
Both in the afternoon and the evening
there was a large attendance of white
visitors, who applauded the music and
drank tea, which was served them by
Chinese, Japanese and Syrian girls. Visit
ors were expected to take away the cups
as a souvenir.
The programme opened with a proces
sional hymn, 'Onward, Christian Sol
diers," which was sung by the forty-two
girls of the home as they entered the
board room. Another ; hymn followed,
after which Master Woo Hop, a Chinese
youth of some four summers, entertained
the audience with a recitation. Fong
Cheng, the star performer of the after
noon, is a young lady wno, in Chinese
circles, is considered a great harpvirtuosa.
She played a solo on the Mongolian variety
of harp in a way which brought down the
house. Fong Cheng also accompanied
King" Sum, who warbled a Chinese volks
lied. :77 : 7 â 
There were a number of other interest
ing features on the programme, including
kindergarten exercises by the children of
the school, under the direction of Mitu, a
clever Japanese girl. Mitu and Chida,
another damsel from the Mikado's king
dom, also sang a duet. An American
song was rendered by Mr. Chukiamu and
Mr. Minikichi sang the national air of
the South Sea Islanders and two Siamese
and Laos girls gave a sketch in national
costume. 7EmV&BBB&
Altogether the entertainment, which
was managed by the ladies of the Occiden
tal Board, was a great success. There was
a large attendance both afternoon and
evening.

It snowed yesterday; it snowed in Cali
fornia; it snowed in San Francisco. The
last clause is the only surprising part of
this sentence. It often snows in California,
though there seems to be a popular belief
that when one has reached California one
has passed beyond the snow line. But this
is only true as to the valleys. Shasta and
Mount Whitney are snow-capped the year
around, and almost all the foothills north
of San Francisco Bay, especially those of
the Sieria Nevadas, have "glorious cover

But the snow came down from the
mountains yesterday, as it were, and
mingled itself with the dust of Market

early yesterday morning were greeted with
a most unusual vision. All the hills around
were white, the streets were white, the
house 0 and trees and lampposts and all
things out of doors took on the virginal
hue.

said Weather Prophet Hammon yester
day. "Saturday night I sent out bulletins
advising the farmers to expect a fruit

There was but one thing could save mil
lions of dollars worth of fruitâ and that
one thing occurred. The atmosphere be
came ladcned with moisture. This kept
the temperature above the freezing point.
The lowest point reached by the mercury
was 37 deg. Had the air remained dry the
mercury would have kept on in its down
ward course. The cold wave has been
general all over the State, but luckily the
moisture has been quite as general. Pos
sibly some damage was done below the
Tehachapi, but I do not think so.
"No, > tne danger has not passed yet.
Should it clear off while this cold spell
lasts the thermometer would fall probably
5: or 10 degs. lower than it has been and
then the fruit will suffer. But I do not
expect this. It will probably rain again
to-night, and I do not expect it to clear
off until alter to-morrow."
THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS.
Secretary B. M. Le Long: Discusses
the Probabilities of the Cold
Wave.
Secretary Le Long of the State Board of
Horticulture stated yesterday that he had
been rather uneasy over the possible ef
fects of the cold wave which has swept
over California. He said, however, that it
was too soon to be able to see the result of
the remarkably cold weather upon fruit
trees in the interior.
"In a few days from now we will be able
to tell what, damage, if any, is done," he
explained. "At the present, however, the
trees do not show any signs of withering
from the cold. And yet I am afraid that
the cold may have i caught some of the
tender young shoots before the rain and
snow came. The apricots, peaches and
some other varieties of the earlier fruits
are in blossom and liable to feel the cold
badly.
"I have not heard from the orange dis
tricts yet, but the cold wave appears from
published accounts to have been quite
generally distributed. This is the height
of the citrus * fruit season. Oranges are
ripe and others are coming in. The frost
has the effect of drying the juices in both
the ripe and ripening oranges that is,
leaving them like nothing but so much
dry, tough fiber, without flavor. It may
be that the frost and the cold wave have
caught the , orange groves, but the proba
bilities are all against it. All we can do
now is to wait for a day or two for full
information.
* "If the fruil orchards have been touched
seriously at this season it may mean a
heavy loss to the State."
THEY SNOWBALLED.
A Largfl Number of Snow-Intoxi
cated Skylarkers Arrested by
the Police.
As the snow accumulated on the pave
ments the novelty of the white visitation
was such that the passers-by were seized
with the snowballing fever, and the cold,
icy globes began to fly through the air.
Along Market street pedestrians were
greeted with a bombardment, street-cars
received full volleys, and a number of
glass panes were broken by the missiles.
The sport was soon stopped, however,
by the police, a number of extra officers
being detailed to check the dangerous
pastime.

STEAM ROADS NOT MEANT
Argument for a Mandamus in
Favor of the Valley
Road.
WHAT THE LAW REALLY MEANS
Decisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States Quoted by Attor
ney Preston.
The Supreme Court sitting in bank yes
terday heard the argument in the matter
of the rehearing granted- some time ago of
the application of the San Francisco and
Han Joaquin Valley Railway Company for
a writ of mandate against C. J. Craycroft,
president, and the Board of Trustees of the
city of Fresno, requiring them: to grant a
franchise to the company named for the
laying of a roadbed and the operation of
its cars through fifteen blocks of the city
of Fresno, such being a part of its route
from San Francisco to Bakersfieid.
Five Justices were present, namely,
Justices Beatty, McFarland, Garoutte,
Harrison and Henshaw. It was agreed by
the counsel that the two absent Justices
should participate in the opinion to be
rendered in the matter.
It will be remembered that when the
railroad company applied ito the City
Trustees of Fresno for a franchise to oper
ate the road through that city, City Attor
ney Moultrie advised that the franchise
should be sold to the highest bidder. Not
withstanding that there was only one ap
plicant for the franchise the Trustees
announced their intention of acting in
conformity with his advice, for the pur
pose of saving themselves from any possi
ble damage suits on the part of property
owners. -.;
Colonel E. F. Preston thereupon applied
to the Supreme Court for a writ of,man
date and upon the statements made at
that time the court denied the application
for the writ. A motion for a rehearing
was then made and granted and the argu
ment was made yesterday.
City Attorney Moultrie opened the argu
ment with a statement that the Board of
Trustees had proceeded to advertise for
bids for that franchise under the statutes
of 1893. Mr. Moultrie read the law bear
ing upon the matter. He announced that
the position of the Board of. Trustees is
that they have no right to assume that the
word "all railroads" refers to street rail
roads alone and that they must" take the
act as they find it. The petitioners con
tended that the words do not refer, to
steam railroads. -
With reference to the contention that
the act was unconstitutional because it
sought to regulate legislation by county
governments and municipal governments,
the speaker argued that it seemed clear
that the act embraced but one subject, and
that was the subject of granting fran
chises. 77777} . .
K. I. Preston followed on behalf of the
petitioners. He argued that if the act
â¢was to be interpreted as the Fresno City
Attorney prescribed it would be found that
many statutes are spread on the books that
seemed to have been placed in entire ignor
ance of the broad principles that underlie
the subjects of which they pretend to treat.
All railroad franchises derive their pow
ers from the general grant in the code,
and are required to comply with certain
prerequisites.such as the amount of the sub
scription, and so forth. Subdivision 5 of
section 470 of the code provides for a grant
in presenti to the corporation, which is a
part of its charter powers. That is limited
in another section, by which no railroad
corporation must use* any street, alley or
highway unless the right so to use has
been granted by the town trustees or other
authorities.
The act of 1893 uses the word "rail
roads." That language is very, general,
but if the statute is considered in the light
of the construction given by the highest
court in the country and by the settled
rules of statutory construction, it will be
found to be a judicial and proper con
struction of that statute to limit its opera
tion to such roads as come within the pur
view of the statute. The Trustees of the
city of Elizabeth, N. J., passed an ordinance
granting the right to lay tracks on its
streets and attempted to justify the opera
tion Of a steam railroad under that charter,
but the Supreme Court of New Jersey held
that they could not apply the words
"railroad" or "railroad tracks" to steam
railroads, because it was not presumed
that a grant of that sort would be made
where there would be compensation to
abutting property-owners.. That was the
foothold upon which the. New Jersey casa
rested..
In the United States Supreme Court
there was a case where the word "rail
roads" was used indifferently, including
both street railroads and steam railroads.
That was in the general language: of the
charter of the city of Memphis, and that
was limited by the United States Supreme
Court and was construed to be . appli
cable to steam railroads and not to . street
railroads. This opinion â â¢ was based upon
looking at the surrounding, circumstances
and the results that would flow from any
other construction. -
In the 'case of Hummock vs. Farmers'
Trust Company, 105 United States Reports,
the Supreme Court of the United States
held that the statutes of Illinois relating
to the sale of real estate \ under execution
must be followed, but when' they came to
construe with reference to steam railroads
they decided that it was impracticable and
impossible to apply the law. It would be
equivalent to splitting the charter into
piecemeal where the : road ran through
different counties ;of the State ; they f de
cided that it should be sold as a whole.
Hence the rule of the United States courts
as to sales and redemption is that there is no
right to redemption in such cases. ' So
the United States Supreme Court brushed
aside all the proceedings in relation to
chattel mortgages. ; They said- that those
provisions relating to chattel mortgages in
the State of Illinois had no application to
the personal property of a railroad, rest
ing their decision on. public use.
â¢ In ail these cases the main thought has
been the broad general use of the public
the necessity of opening up new avenues
for commerce to facilitate the , conveyance
of the products of the interior, to the sea
board and of those of the seaboard to the
interior, and this doctrine of adjudication
has become the law of many States. .}
â¢ The entirety of a railroad charter was
the next thing to which Mr. Preston called
the attention of the court. In speaking of
the right of the people of Pasadena to ad
vertise for bids on * a franchise the court
spoke of the sovereignty of the . State in
this matter. The ; constitution of â  this
State regards these franchises :as an en
tirety. All the ; methods of taxation, all
the constitutional* provisions regard them
in this light. The State Board of Equali
zation pro rates them to the counties and
to the cities. 7 ' - , . .
' If this be true, if this be a broad charter
for a public use . from San \ Francisco : to
Bakersfield, if it is an entirety 1 ; for every
purpose,' will it be supposed that the Leg
islature of this State intended that a bite
should be taken out of it here, and a bite
there by the' highest ; bidders? The run
ning of the road over the highways of the
county and over the streets of the city are
simply incidents. That is a charter right
which \ the * railroad x company 7 acquired
under the code. So, ; these statutes must
,be \ read ;. with v a view to ;â  the : purpose for
which they were intended. It is supposed
that those statutes will act for the public
'good.'-:"."*. "'.*.'"","
These City Trustees have discretion, and
it will be presumed that they will exercise
that discretion for the public good. There
can be no bidder for the right to run from
San Francisco to Bakersfield unless there
is i another â â ;: steam - railroad 7 corporation
which . has a similar franchise.. Every
steam â  road that seeks to ' run through a
city is a different use and a different fran
chise. " -' â ' ' : . , _ . '
Down in the southern part of the State
they tried to get out ; of this by supposing
that the road would be connected at both
ends of the city with a through ; road, but
that attempt failed. "What class of bidders
would there be for the privilege of going
through Fresno on its way from San * ran
cisco â¢to Bakersfield ? No individual can
bid for a franchise to operate a steam rail
road through the city. /â¢ ,>â , ' 7
The ri-ht to collect tolls is a part of the
public use. The Trustees of Fresno may
consent to the use Of its streets as a par* of
the general State franchise and charter,
and there can be .no: bidder unless there
was another steam road incorporated be
tween the same termini.
Mr. Preston, in closing, bis case, pre
sented the court with a long list of authori
ties, and the matter was finally submitted.
AN ELECTRIC FIGHT.
The "Mutual" Company Says It Has
Been Unlawfully Interfered With.
The Mutual Electric Light Company has
secured an order of court restraining the
Superintendent of Streets from interfering
with the work of the plaintiff in putting
up electric-light poles in front of the
Blytbe property on Market street. *
Work was commenced by the company
early Sunday morning, but before the
sidewalk had been broken in more than
one or two places the police were notified,
and Sergeant Birdsall, with a squad of
men, stopped the work. The police had
been notified that the company would try
to erect the poles without first obtaining
permission, so when word was sent in that
the work was in progress orders to stop
the men or arrest them were at once is
sued.
In asking for an order restraining inter
ference the company directs its attack
against Superintendent of Streets Ash
worth. It is alleged that six months ago
the company was given the right to lay
conduits for the wires to furnish electric
lights, and that as the owners of the prop
erty had requested the ; lights to be put in
it had a right to erect the poles.
In its complaint the plaintiff corpora
tion alleges that the Superintendent of
Streets in preventing the work exercised
his authority unequally, oppressively, un
fairly and contrary to law and in a way to
discriminate in favor of the Edison Light
and Power Company, whose lights are al
ready in place, and against the defendant:
It is further charged that the Superintend
ent of Streets is attempting to prevent the
Mutual Light Company from gaining afoot
hold on Market street, where the lights of
its rival, the Edison Company, are already
established.
Judge Seawell will hear the case.
NO MONUMENT FOR LICK
A Marble Slab on the Building
He Gave Will Be
Sufficient.
So Said the California Pioneers at
Their Meeting, After a Very
Spirited Discussion.
-â  _,*Â» **Â£>
The Society of California Pioneers de
cided last night that the magnificent be
quests made to California ami to science
by James Lick were the best and the most
enduring monuments to his memory, and
that the $100,000 or more which would be
necessary to erect in Golden Gate Park a
fitting memorial for their dead benefactor
would be more wisely expended in smooth
ing the pathway of aged and indigent Pio
neers.
Secretary John I. Spear read the follow
ing resolution, , which was introduced at
the preceding meeting by C.Vreeland: ,r
Resolved, Tnat it is the sense of the members
of the Society of California Pioneers that this
society should take measures to have erected a
suitable monument to the memory of the late
James Lick in Golden Gate Park.
Charles M. Plum opened the discussion
by remarking that the selection of plans
and the building of the monument would
probably require the expenditure of
$100,000 or more. James Lick himself was
a monument builder, and his magnificent
bequests were his best monuments. He
would never be forgotten while these re
mained. _j_*Bfasao**Si_flf
James King was of the opinion that
the outlay for the monument would cut off
some of the relief now being extended to
aged and indigent Pioneers.
E. B. . Vreeland advocated the erection of
the monument. The society had $200,000
in cash and $400,000 in real estate, and
could well afford the expenditure. .
Judge Niles Searls and others spoke
against the proposition and the resolution
was indefinitely postponed. They were
of the opinion that a slab on the Pioneer
building stating that the property was
the gift of James Lick would be sufficient.
HE SHOT HIS WIFE.
Charles Schopesa Prevented From Com
mitting Murder by Boy.
The preliminary examination of Charles
Schopesa on the charge of assault to mur
der was held before Judge Campbell yes
terday. Or. February 12 Schopesa fired a
shot at his wife Anna in their house at 233
Green street, the bullet lodging in her hip.
Mrs. Schopesa probably owed her life to
Giovanni Fava, a boy. He testified- that
he heard Schopesa and his wife quarrel
ing and he peeped through the keyhole of
the door to see what was going on. He
saw Schopesa pull a'; revolver out of ' his
pocket, and as he leveled' it at his wife's
heart he opened the door, sprang upon his
back and struck his arm down just as the
revolver exploded. ;
Other evidence was given and the Judge
herd Schopesa to answer before the Su
perior Court in $20,000 bonds. ;> : :

BINTS TOWOMEN.
What Two Ladles Had; to Say.
;"I wish I could on ly do something :or take ':
something that would make me feel strong and
well.'.' said ft titeJ, worh-lookiue woman re- â¢
cently. , '.'l; can eat nothing, I have no appe-
tite, I suffer badly from indigestion and tired,
miserable feelings.' I can get no relief."
There are thousands ox women* who find
themselves in exactly the same" condition as
this lady. They its feeling out of sorts and
"under the weather." They seem to require
something to stimulate them, renew their vi-
tality and give them new life. The question is,
What ought they to do in order to feel well ?
â¢ The best answer to this question; is to be
found in the following opinions of some reli-
able people who speak from experience :
Mrs Ella Feddermann, 291 XV. Fayette street,
Baltimore, says: "Some time ago 1 suffered
from terrible sinking spells and headaches as
the result of a run-down system and extreme
nervousness. I obtained no relief until a
friend persuaded me to. try Daily's pure malt
whiskey.' After using it only a short time I
became fully restored to health.'
Mr. John Kelley Chase of Amesbury, Mass
says* "For six years past my wife suffered
from insomnia and nervous prostration. Her
physicians lecornmended the use of a. gentle
stimulant, -he la? lately tried Duff pure
malt whi-kev with exc.-llentie-ults. It has in-
duced sleep and is building up her health.
While Mrs. Chase has always been staunch in
her temperance principles, she has no hesita-
tion in lecommendlng Duffy's pure malt to
every one who needs the help of a healthful
stimulant." '''.._._.. '
Every person who has ever tried Duffy s pure
malfwh'iskev finds that it has a wonderful
effect in promoting health. There is nothing -
like it for driving away blue, despondent feel-
ing and making weak, sickiy people strong
and vigorous.

REV. D. M. ROSS
Father Yorke Says Only
Fifteen Authors Were
. Quoted.
TWO WERE THEOLOGICAL
The Priest Declares That the
Rev. Ross Wendteized His
Quotations.
CIVIL LAWS AND THE CHURCH.
What Cardinal Gibbons Said in Re
gard to. the Temporal Power
of the Pope.
Rev. P. C. Yorke writes as follows
in answer to Rev. D. M. Ross:
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sib: Last
week I gave as briefly as I could my answer-, to
the lectures of D. Ross on the four propositions.
Owing to the limited time which elapsed from
the moment I received the stenographic report
until your paper went to press, I was compelled
to confine myself to an exposition of the
forgery perpetrated by D. Ross in the four
propositions themselves. Concerning the quo
tations produced by Ross, I declared that they
had been torn from their Wenateized
in that skillful fashion peculiar to preachers.
'. promised then to examine the quotations in
detail when I should have more leisure. To
keep that promise 1 have, even to the risk
superinducing an attack of softening of the
brain, reread the four lectures which D. Ross
inflicted on an unoffending community at
two-bits a lecture.
HIS library.
The Rev. Mr. Ross is loud in his wail that |
he has been put to great expense in connection j
with this controversy. He estimates it at over j
$600. If we subtract $150 for hall ret. and i
advertising we will have $450 to be squandered ;
on Catholic literature. Indeed. D. Ross leaves '
his audience under the impression that he has !
collected an enormous quantity of Catholic j
books. He says*. "I have a large library of I
Catholic literature, I assure you, that has ac- j
cumulated since this conflict began."
It is a very peculiar thing that if D. Ross has j
such a large library he has made such little !
â¢use of it. Alter a careful examination of his!
quotations I find that he refers to fifteen
authors. Five of those are elementary books ;
of instruction ranging from the penny cate
chism to Jouin and Schouppe. Two of- them :
are sermons or lectures, two biographies, one
historical, three miscellaneous and only j
two , theological. This curious collection is
suggestive of nothing but. the dilapidated re
mains of a bookstore. The whole outfit could
be easily purchased for far less than $100.
How much below this figure his literary ex
penses must have been can be well understood
when we recollect that the books he exhibited
a: Metropolitan Hall bore on their backs
the marks which showed that they belonged
to the Free Library.
HIS STUDIES.
P. Ross was especially vociferous concerning
his long and weary researches among these
Catholic books. With tears in his voice he de
scribed the long watches of the night spent in
exploring the mystery of iniquity. "I have
often labored," he declared, "until 2 o'clock in
the 'morning." No doubt the audience be
lieved him. They would believe anything..
As a matter of tact an ordinary reader working
only eight hours a day could get through all
tne ; works cited by D.Ross in less than two
weeks. It took D. Ross three months, but,
then, "he must have thunk a power."
S*~ * ' â  II IS ACCCRACr.
D. Ross M*Â»as# specially provoked that I ac- i
cused him of talcing his quotation's at second !
hand. In making that accusation I had I
chosen the milder of two charges. He was
either deliberately falsifying or he had never
teen the books he pretended to describe.
Thus, tor instance, he speaks of Schouppe's
"Abridged Course of Religious Instruction," an
elementary text book, as bearing "upon it the
approval of the Propaganda in Rome." As a
matter of fact the book bears no such ap
proval. Moreover, to make such a statement j
is as reasonable as to assert that the last edi
tion of The Sunday Call bore upon it the ap
proval of the Department of Agriculture in I
. Washington. - Either D. Ross never saw j
L Echouppe or he asserted the thing that is not. j
Again, he speaks of Jouin's "Evidences of
:' Religion" as "a work which has the approval
: of the Pope and the imprimatur of Cardinal *
Manning." â¢ *
The fact is that Jouin's "Evidences" are pub- |
lished by "O'Shea" without the vestige of an j
approval or imprimatur from any one 'whomso- j
ever-. Again, either U. Ross never saw Jouin j
or he asserted* the thing that is not.
. Again, in dealing with Smith's "Ecclesiastical J
Law" he says "that work was submitted to his j
Holiness the Pope and two men were appoint- I
ed to examine the work to see if it was all right.
It was passed upon by these two censors, under '
the supervision of the Pope, and became not I
only the law, but the textbook of law of the |
Catholic church in the United States.
Now I may mention, In the first place, that
the Pope had as much to do with the book as !
D. Ross. Does D. Ross imagine that the Pope
has nothing to trouble him but the supervision
of textbooks? In the second place, the book
did not become "the law of the Catholic church
of the United States." If D. Ross were
honest he might have read and inwardly
digest the words of the author, "We do not
pretend to construe these documents into a
positive approbation of our work." Approba
tion by whom? The Pope? By no means
"By the sacred congregation of the Propa
ganda or its illustrious Cardinal Prefect."
Smith has too much sense to imagine that his
book is the law of the Catholic church or that
it is even the textbook. He simply claims that
" is a correct worn and in conformity with ec
clesiastical jurisprudence. But it has no more
Handing before the courts of the church than
any correct textbook of civil law has before
the courts of the state.
Once more D. Ross either never saw Smith's
"Elements of Ecclesiastical Law," or he de
liberately misrepresented its character, secure
in the ignorance of his audience.
' HIS HONESTY.
-- - With much reiteration D. Ross asserted that
he was "absolutely honest" in citing from his
authority. He appealed to God with an oath
that he had not suppressed an "if" nor altered
an "and." "How absolutely- honest I was to
give paragraphs instead of sentences broken
'Sentences in order to give the full spirit of the
: quotation every time." . â _,
i The admirable honesty of D. Ross will appear
in the course of this examination of his lec
-1 tures I will only quote one or two instances
here to show that I did hot exaggerate when I
accused him of being an adept in the art of
Weridteization.
In his first lecture he was attempting to
prove that in case of conflict between the
ecclesiastical and civil powers the ecclesiastical
ought to prevail. To do this he quoted from
â¢Smith: ;â < . : Â - . . "â¢;
' "When a Christian world came into exist
ence the civil society of men became subject
to the spiritual direction of the church."
"And then it goes on to say: "In whatsoever
things, whether essentially or by accident, the
spiritual endâ is the end of the churchâ
necessarily involved, in those things the
church may by right exert its power and the
civil state ought to yield," etc. *
Now when we turn to Smith we find the
first sentence on page 257 in the midst of
a description of a Catholic state that
existed in the Middle Ages, while^we. find
what "it goes on to say" on page 253. four
pages back, following a declaration which D.
Rom carefully forgot to quote: "The civil so
ciety or the state, even though every* member
of it be Catholic, is not subject to the church
but plainly independent in temporal things
which regard its temporal end. This very sen
tence is a version of the sentiments of Cardinal
Tarquini, which sentiments r quoted some
time ago for the edification of Dr. \\endte,.
when he was engaged in the same hopeless
task as I). Ross. 'â <â  ''â â -' : 77 !______,Â«_
Then, in order to obfuscate the minds of his
audience, D. Ross calmly suppresses a who.c
page of explanation following the sentence he
quoted. This explanation shows clearly that
the indirect spiritual power of the church over
the state is precisely the same power claimed
and exercissd by every preacher In America
when he tries to amend the morals of the com
munity by demanding the enactment or en
forcement of certain measures. .â  f . . -
Moreover, when he .skipped this interesting
page (because it would give the true spirit 01
the quotation! he descended upon the unfor
tunate bull "I'nam Sanctam". and proceeded to
pick it to pieces. Without a sign of omission
he suppresses the following significant words:
- "Now, what is the meaning* of this decide
definition? There are two interpretaUnns:
One given by the enemies of the Papacy is
that the Pope in this bull claims not merely an
indirect, but a direct and absolute power over
the state, thus completely subordinating it to
the church even in purely temporal things. 7
"This explanation.glven formerly by the par
tisans of Philip the Fair by the -legalists in
the reign of Louis XIV, and at present by
Janus, Dr. Schulte, the old Catholics, and the
opponents of the Papal infallibility in general,
is designed to throw odium upon the Holy See
and arouse the passions of men, especially of
governments against the lawful authority of
the sovereign pontiff."
Perhaps it was, because these words were
such an accurate description' of his own mode
of action that I). Ross suppressed them.
Again, no doubt in order to get the true
spirit of the quotation, D. Koss leaves out the
following: "Thus the illustrious Bishop Fess
ler, secretary to the Vatican Council, says that
this bull affirms merely that Christian rulers
are subject to the Pope "as head of the church,
but not in purely temporal things; 'still less,'
continues Fessler, 'does it [the bull] say (as
Dr. Schulte formulates his second proposition)
that the temporal power must act uncon
ditionally in subordination to the spiritual."
Again, take another beautiful example. In
the first lecture and several times after D. Ross
insisted on the following quotation: "Civil
laws derive all their force, so far as they are
applicable to ecclesiastical matters, solely
from the authority of the church."
Upon this he comments as follows:
"Look at the significance of thai! Civil laws,
so far as they touch the Catholic church, de
rive all their authority from the Catholic
church; and if the Catholic church says that
these laws are not right, they just simply ride
over them."
Of course it was to get the true spirit of the
quotation that Donald Ross tore a relative
clause out of a sentence, dressed it up with a
new head, docked its tail and sent it out into
the world to do service against the Catholic
church. i Oh ! D. Ross is an honorable man, and
he has sworn before high heaven that he has
been scrupulously faithful in dealing with the
Papists.
Now, let us see where D. Ross got the quota
tion and how he manipulates it. In
the chapter on the sources of canon
law Smith is dealing with the legis
lative authority of the church. He is
treating of church lawâ that is to say, with
laws for the internal guidance of the church.
Ho says that there are eight sources of church
law, and he goes on to name them scripture,
tradition, councils, etc*. If he were dealing with
Methodist canon law lie would proceed in the
same manner, for, be it distinctly understood,
he is treating simply of the rules which gov
ern the workings of an ecclestical society.
Then he goes goes on to say: "To those
[sources] some add 'civil laws.' which, how
ever, derive all their force, BO far as they are
applicable to ecclesiastical matters, solely from
the authority oi the church. In fact, in her
judicature the church disdains not to adopt at
times the mode of proceedings which is pecu
liar to civil courts."
Now let me ask: Suppose a court constituted
under Congregational polity determines to
adopt the mode of procedure in Judge Camp
bell's court, whence does that mode of proced
ure derive its force? Simply from the author
ity of the Congregational council. The civil
laws are careful not to interfere with the laws
of an ecclesiastical body, and if the church
uses the forms and modes prescribed by civil
law these forms and modes are of force, not
from their civil authority, but simply from the
authority of the church. This is precisely
what Smith says and what our American con
stitution says, but D. Ross, in order to get the
"spirit pf the quotation," lifts it bodily from its
context and presents it to the world as a new
â and startling manifestation of Romish treason.
It must have been near _ in the morning when
he made this astounding discovery.
CARDINAL GIBBONS.
Ido not wish to . take up much more time
with this preliminary demonstration of the
honesty of D. Ross, but 1 cannot refrain from
giving another example. In his last lecture he
undertakes to prove ''that men have no right
to go to the ballot-box unless you go with
Father Yorke's ballot." He quotes from Car
dinal Gibbons: "The Roman people, had they
so desired, had |no - right to transfer
by their suffrage the patrimony 'of St.
Peter to Victor Emmanuel." He aban
dons the Cardinal and English grammar
at this point and exclaims: "I thought the I
people were the governing* power. But here the
people living in the Papal states had no right â¢
10 say who should rule over them and govern
them. That is a beauty. We talk about the
Czar of Russia; he is no worse than that. Now
does that not mean that the church has a
right to dominion over temporal affairs? When
th- say that the people living in those States
had" no right by their votes to choose their
governors does that not mean that the church
has a right to dominiDn over temporal affairs?
lam sure that that sounds beautiful in the
cars of Americans, who love election day."
[Applause.]
Now let us turn to Cardinal Gibbons. He is
discussing that feature known as the temporal
power of the Pope, or the claim of the Popes '
to sovereignty over the City of Rome and the
adjacent territory. He describes that territory
as an ecclesiastical District of Columbia, and
he asks, Was the .alleged vote of the Roman
people -sufficient reason for depriving the Pope
lof his patrimony . This is his argument: "In
â  the second place, the Roman people, even had
! they so desired, had no right to transfer, by
their suffrage, the patrimony of St. Peter to
' Victor Emmanuel. They could not give what
i did not belong to them. The Papal territory
i was granted to tne Popes in trust for the use
and benefit of the Catholics of Christendom.
; The Catholic world, therefore, and not merely
I a handful, of Roman subjects, must give
its - consent before, such a .transfer can
be declared legitimate. Rome is to Catholic
Christendom what Washington is to ;the
! United States. As the citszens of Washington
I have no power, without the concurrence of the
I United States, to annex their city to Maryland
I or Virginia, neither can the citizens of Rome
| hand over their city to the kingdom of Pied
! Mont without the acquiescence of the faithful
| dispersed throughout the world."
There is not a word in this quotation which
| is opposed to republican ideas. The tempera
\ ture will be much lower than it is this evening,
Mr. Editor, when D. Ross will be able to teach
Americanism to Cardinal Gibbons.
GENERALITIES.
Before concluding this preliminary examina
tion let me say a word or two on D. ' Ross'
j learning. He has made so many boasts about
: his skill in foreign languages, his" acquaintance
! with history and his knowledge of Catholic
theology that we are almost tempted to for
give his ''Me, of course" and other weaknesses
I on English grammar. However, a man who
: could translate the German "ttatte" as "has"
ought to take another year in a Manitobau
1 university. The statement that Doellinger was
lin Rome during the Vatican Council
! is paralleled by the statement that the "Edict
' of Nantes was laid aside so that the massacre
of St. Bartholomew could take place in
j France." Any schoolboy .could inform this
graduate of a" university that the edict of
Nantes was first issued in 1598 and' that the
St. Bartholomew massacre occurred in 1572.
His, creation of 265 Cardinals might be ex
pected from the expert in Catholic theology
who defined an infidel as one not belonging to
the Catholic church.
1 must apologize to your readers, Mr. Editor,
for inflicting all these quotations upon them,
j but as Ross has threatened to spend the
rest of that GOO in printing a pamphlet lam
compelled to provide the antidote. Yours
truly, B_9S_-B_J__B^A^' P. c - Yoeke.

at an End.
The litigation over the "will of Thomas

by Dr. Edward P. Taylor, to. whom the '
case was submitted.
Larkin was an eccentric old man who
left a fortune of $20,000 to friends. Three
claimants appeared who represented them
selves as relatives, and it was their claims
which were submitted to Taylor. Should
they prove kinship the legatees agreed to
give them one- the estate; if not they,
were to get nothing.
Taylor's decision has been rendered, and
by its terms the claimants 7 are held not to
be relatives, and their claims are therefore
not to be noticed. \

as much comfort depicted on their features
as might be expected on the face of a dude
searching the Arctic regions for the north
pole, dressed in a lawn-tennis suit. Buf
falo coats would have been a welcome in
novation. A few scattering snowflakes,
falling . once . during the afternoon was a
reminder of the oldGuttenburg clays, when
the riders, carried stoves | and stopped to
fry ham and eggs during the trip to the
wire. _ _ . , 7
Favorites and second choices captured
all of the races. Kamsin and Gratify, who
ran the dead heat, were nearly equal favor
ites in the ring.
The race responsible for the dead-heat
decision was a seven-furlong run, the
fourth event of the day. The books held
Kamsin at 9 to 10, with evens against the
Westchester stable representative.'* Coch
ran, on Kamsin, took the leajl down the
backstretch, and was not caught by the
second choice until- well on toward the
wire. Beth Griffin and Cochran then went
hard at work on their mounts, and they
passed the wire in what looked to be a
victory for Kamsin by a head, but the
judges decided it a dead heat. The purse
was divided. -,'."'"
Sixteen maidens went to the front in the
opening five-furlong dash, with Wirambo
ruling a slight favorite. Snowdown was
well supported by the "hunch" players.
The winner turned up in Peixotto, a 6 to 1
chance, who won closely from Snowdown,'
with Montallade a poor third.
The muddy track was evidently not to
the liking of "Philip H, the 2 "to 1 favorite
for the two-year-old sprint, for he came in
third. Cyrus King, the second choice
soon headed the bunch and won handily.'
three lengths before Orseno, at 12': to 1 in
the betting. â¢>
.McNaughton and Muir's Basso was a
pronounced favorite for the mile and a
quarter selling event, closing in the bet
ting at 4 to 5, with Wheel of Fortune next
in demand at Bto 5. Little Cripple and
Oakland were the only other starters. The
favorite was badly beaten. Joe Harvey's
mare fairly reveled in the sloppy : going,
'for making all of the running she ran away
from the favorite, winning by V three
lengths in the good time of 2:10)_.; Oak
land secured the show. y - 777-7.
The two entries of Frank Farrar in the
mile handicap over four hurdles, Three
Forks and Tom Clarke, were hot favorites
in the betting, the ring holding the stable
at 7to 10. A hot; tip went the rounds on
Red Will, sending his odds down from 12
to 7 to 1.
Three Forks was in the lead from the
jump, and although tiring badly near the
end managed to last long enough to heat
Red Will half a length. The latter was
interfered with in the stretch, which miti
gated against his chances somewhat. {
The mile dash over the inside course
saw Billy McCloskey go to the post a
slight favorite over Rebellion, after the
latter horse had opened favorite. The 100
to 1 shot, Two Cheers, shot to the front
when the flag fell and leading throughout
was only beaten by an "eyebrow" on the
wire by the favorite, splendidly ridden by
Shaw. Rebellion was unplaced.
INDOOR CYCLE RACING
Entries for the Big Tournament
to Be Held at the
Pavilion.
There Will Be Seven Consecutive
Evenings' Racing and a Big
Cycle Show.
The indoor cycle tournament and show,
to be held at the Mechanics' Pavilion from
March 5 to 11 inclusive, seems to be an as
sured success. The track is now in posi
tion and the racers are training on it all
the while. Only one fault was found with
it two posts at the south end, which will
be removed, making it perfectly safe.
The exhibitors began placing their ex
hibits and decorating their spaces yester
day. This ; part of the show will be a very
interesting feature. '-"\ .-.'.. ..
. There are more than double the number,
of entrants for the races over the indoor
tournament- of last year. All the crack
riders are entered, and those who have
tried the track pronounce it perfectly safe
and very fast.

Insert Bicycle Tournament
The handicaps of the men will be an
nounced on the night before each handi
cap race occurs. The heats for the events
next week will be arranged to-morrow.
Every possible effort is being made by
the Southern Pacific Company to encour
age a good attendance from interior towns
to the bicycle show. A special rate of $_
for the round trip, including admission to
the show, has been made from San Jose
and Santa Clara, the tickets to be good on
the afternoon train of the 7th and the
morning train of the Bth. General Passen
ger Agent T. H.Goodman has issued a
circular letter to passenger agents within a
radius of 100 miles advising them to make
known the fact of the great bicycle show
and tournament to all interested in bi
cycling, and informing the agents that
they may offer a rate of one regular fare
and one-third for parties of fifteen persons
or more who may want to make the trip
together. For parties of fifty persons or
more a lower rate than this will be made.
Those who hold return tickets, it is fur
ther stated, will be able to secure admis
sion to the show for 25 cents, one-half the
regular rate.
W. A. Terrill. the crack racer of the Bay
City Wheelmen, who has been on the Na
tional racing circuit, returned yesterday,
and was at the Pavilion in the afternoon
trying the new track. He was much
pleased with it and will probably enter all
the events for which he is eligible. He
and C. S. Wells are both heavy-weight
racers, each weighing over 200 pounds, but
they are exoerienced riders and found no
difficulty in negotiating the curves of the
track.
The wheelmen are enthusiastic over the
approaching tournament, which will with
out doubt eclipse anything of the kind
ever held on the coast. *
FOUND DEAD IN A BATHTUB.
S. M. Barton, an Insurance Solicitor,
Expires at the I. irk Baths.
..â  S. .M. Barton, an insurance solicitor,
lately employed in an agency at 204 San
some street, found dead last evening
in a bathtub at the Lick Baths, on Tenth
street. Barton called at the baths yester
day afternoon at 4:15 o'clock and procured
a room, saying that he would remain not
to exceed half an hour. â¢; *
. T.F. Alfred, an employe at the baths,
knocked at the door of . the room occupied
by the solicitor and upon receiving no i
response the door was forced and the life
less body was found totally submerged in
the water. The unfortunate man was im
mediately removed from the tub ana a
physician summoned, who pronounced
life extinct. The body was removed to
the Morgue. It is not known whether the
deceased met his death by drowning or !
from heart disease, but this fact will be dis
cerned through an autopsy which is to be
held by Dr. J. S. Barrett to-morrov . From
letters found among the effects of the de
ceased it was learned. that at one time he
had been employed as a solicitor for the
Wheeler & Wilson Manufacturing Com
pany at Mobile, Ala. He has been con
nected with various insurance firms in this
City for the past * three years. As far as
can be ascertained he leaves no relatives
on this coast, but it is presumed that he
leaves a family in the East.
ARRESTED FOR PERJURY.
E. A. Isaacs, a Theatrical Man, Locked
Up in the City Prison.
E. A. Isaacs, a theatrical man, was ar
rested last night by Detectives Gibson and
Wren and locked up In the City Prison on
the charge of perjury.
Ina Mercer applied for a divorce from
her husband, and on May 24 last the case
was heard before Judge SlacK. Isaacs was
one of the witnesses and testified that he
was present at their marriage in Portland
and that the woman had been forced into
the marriage. It is now . alleged that
Isaacs was in this City at the time of the
marriage, and therefore perjured himself
by. testifying that he was in Portland at
the marriage ceremony.

Do You Use \w
A Battery? 3-
AN ELECTRIC BATTERY, BY THH
exercise of much patience, you' spend
fifteen or twenty minutes in its application
daily. You get good results from it, ol
i course; but the time spent, the inconveni-
! ence, the jarring, jolting sensations it gives
i your nerves, unpleasant, and not always
â¢satisfactory. The battery sometime!
: causes injury.
THIS IS WHY
| It is like trying to force a big foot into a
: .mall shoe sometimes it will go, but it
hurts the shoe, and the foot. The shock
from the battery jars the nerves and the
I good it does is in the shaking up you get,
not that you absorb any strength," for you
don't.
DR. SANDEN'S
I ELECTRIC BELT
DOES what the battery aims to do; it
soaks strength into the weakened nerves.
There is no shock, only a steady/even cur-
I rent. You feel it all the time, and it givet
, ; you Electricity slowly for hours at a time,
as you wear it while you sleep. You ab-
sorb this current and it stays in the body.
I IT CURES
I All nervous or chronic weakness, kidney
; trouble, torpid liver, weak stomach, lame
back, rheumatism, in fact, it cures all dis-
eases arising from weakness or inaction of
the organs of the body.

Oats, Corn and Rye dull.

Potatoes and Onions weak.
Butter continues to decline.
Eggs neld more firmly.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures '
st station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high* means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded and
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast.
When the pressure Is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north and
south along the coast, rain is probable: but when
the "low" is inclosed with isobars of marked curva- '
ture rain south of â¢ Oregon Is improbable. With a
"high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and the pressure
falling to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these conditions will produce
an opposite result. â

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 2.â 8u1l help in wheat
came from an unexpected source and in the shape
of an accident this morning. The burning at Min
neapolis of an elevator containing about 600,000
bushels of wheat furnished strength to prices at
the opening In addition to this, the popular ex
pectation of a good decrease in the visible supply
was something of a support to the market. An
advance over Saturday's close of J^c was noted at
the start, followed by further moderate gains.
Buying orders did not continue free, however, and
after a time values sagged a little. Argentine ship
ments last week were 1,000,000 bushels, and an
estimate of the world's shipments placed the
amount at 6,500.000 bushels.
Liverpool stock decreased 112,500 bushels. Re
ceipts In the Northwest were large at 509 cars and
Chicago bad 106. Inspections from store amounted
to 200.364 bushels. The visible supply decreased
922,000 bushels, and the amount on ocean pas
sage increased 1,120,000 bushels. Seaboard clear-
ances of flour were 36,955 bushels or the equiva
lent of 165.848 bushels of wheat. No actual wheat
Cleared, losing continental cables were irregular.
The English visible supply decreased 420.000
bushels. May wheat opened from 68c to 68y B e,
sold between 66i_c and 671,4 c, closing at 6714 a.
673/ s c, i.,.' under Saturday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 90 cars.
CORNâ Despite the fact that receipts, 427 cars,
were far in excess of the anticipations, corn opened
firmer, taking its power from wheat. Nothing of
more than passing interest transpired, the lend
dency of values after the opening being toward a
lc wer level. Withdrawals from store were 102,391
bushels. Liverpool cables were quiet and un
changed. The visible supply increased 1,520,000
bushels, and the amount on ocean passage 160.000
bushels. Export clearances were 208,298 bush
els. May corn opened at 303,4 c, sold between
3l>v^c and 305/^303,40, closing at 305/ 8 @303/4c,
unchanged from Saturday. Estimated receipts to
morrow 500 cars.
OATSâ Very little change took place in oats, and
not much interest was displayed. While gov
erned by the movements of the other markets
there was, however, not a great amount ot fluctua
tion to prices. Receipts were 365 cars, and 5600
bushels were withdrawn from store. The visible
.supply increased 83.000 bushels. -May closed a
shade under Saturday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 400 ears. - .
FLAXâ Was easy: May, 90yÂ±Â®90y 2 c. Receipts
were 59 cars. '
PROVlSlONSâ Manifested a fair proportion of
firmness, the main reason for which was attributed
to a better feeling in the live hog market. May
pork closed 7y 2 c higher than Saturday, May lard
and ribs each 2*j_@oc higher.

HAILSTONES, SNOW AND FROST
Vegetable - Growers # Have Greater
Cause for Fear Than Owners
of Orchards.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 2. J
Shortly after noon to-day there was. a
violent hailstorm in this county which
lasted nearly half an hour. The weather
was quite cold during the night and this
morning the hills east and north of the
city were covered with snow for the first
time sine* ISS6.
At 7 o'clock this morning snow was
still falling lightly, and ironi Berkeley to
Livermore the grass was covered low
down on the hillsides.
The fruit trees are not far enough ad
vanced toward blossoming to be injured
by the cold spell in most parts of the
county, although the almond trees near
_>iles have suffered somewhat.
There was a b-.ack frost at Haywards on
Saturday night and early yesterday morn
ing, but no damage was done. There was
snow at Niles and Alvarado yesterday and
to-day hailstones of moderate size fell
freely at noon.
If the cold spell continues more than
another day the early vegetables will be
ruined. There is more anxiety shown in
regard to vegetables than to fruit trees,
as the latter are not forward enough to be
frost nipped. To-night a cold rain is fall
ing and the temperature is somewhat
higher. At 5 o'clock Sunday morning the
temperature in Oakland registered 46 deg.
and at the same hour this morning only
35 deg. '

with some other personal property valued

PP.OCKI2DIXGS STOPPED,
State Courts Awaiting Decisions of the !
Federal Courts.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 2.â The efforts
of John Chetwood to find assets of R. P.
Thomas of the Standard Soap Company
to satisfy a large judgment against him
growing out of the California National
Bank failure have been abandoned for a
' time. Judge Friok of the Superior Court
set aside the restraining order made sev
eral weeks ago in the matter and several
motions and demurrers growing out or the
same difficulty were all stricken from the
docket.
This action was taken because of a sim
... ilar order issued out of the Federal, court
against Chetwood directing him not to
proceed in the State courts until the case
against him brought by T. K. Stateler is
settled. That practically lies up every
thing until a decision is reached in the
Federal courts.

California battalion that served during the
rebellion under General Thompson. He
was associated with the latter at the time
of his failure in the trust company in San
Francisco years ago, and lost nearly every
thing. He afterward went with" Archie
Borland, making several trips to New York
ana one to London. The death comes
very sudden and a large circle of friends
mourn his untimely demise.
A Good Living Allowance.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 2.â A petition
â¢ was filed in the Superior Court to-day by
F. P. Bacon, Carrie Bacon and Ella E. B.

D. Bacon, the capitalist, who died in this
city February 19, 18W, has been enjoying

tate, and they say that amount is neces
sary to maintain herself in her accus
tomed mode of living.
The estate was originally appraised at
. ?585,033 78, but there were debt* against it
that amounted to $250,472 42. â  These have

to the power of the board. Mr. Meeks was
informed that it would be well for him to
consult an attorney also.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, ARCH 3, 1896.
FATHER AKERLEY`S GRIEF
He Was Closely Identified With
the History of the \
Majors.
IN A WILMORE IS MISSING.
Her Mother's Case Taken Under Ad.
visementâThe Boys Are
Now at Folsom.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, March 2. I
Next to Mrs. Wagner, the mother of Abe
Majors, the saddest-hearted person in all
Rev. Father Akerley, to Whom Abe Majors' Father Gave His Bible on the Scaffold.
[From a photograph.]
Oakland over the fate that has overtaken
the lad is the venerable Father Benjamin
Akerley, the pastor of St. John's Episcopal
Church..
When the news reached him that Abe
Majors had been arrested for burglary, the
kind-hearted old gentleman was deeply
grieved. A few days later a fit of vertigo
overcame him while standing in his pul
pit, ana it is said that the shock of the
news helped to cause the attack.
The circumstance I brought to Father
Akerley'* mind the last hours of the lad's
father, Lloyd Majors, when he had re
mained with him as his spiritual adviser,
and the subsequent months when he had
visited Majors in the very same prison
where his youngest son was also im
prisoned.
Father . Akerley's mind, went back to
the harrowing scenes of the young wife,
barely having reached her twenty-first
year, when she visited her condemned
husband, with the two little blue-eyed
boys, Abe and Archie, lovingly- clinging to
her hands.
To-day the same woman is crushed to
the earth by her present troubles, and for
her the kind â¢ heart of Father Akerley
almost bleeds.
In an interview to-day he said; 'The
most trying ordeals that I ever experienced
in ray professional capacity were the visits
to Lloyd Majors after he was condemned.
.His affection for his wife and little ones
was extremely touching. Religion was
his consolation, for he was a learned man,
had studied the scriptures and knew their
worth in the hour of death, as he had once
known them in his life. He â  protested
his innocence of the crime for which
he died. He blamed himself for not obey
ing the voice of his conscience, and be
lieved if he had never allowed himself to
keep a saloon he would not have been con
nected with the crowd that" he claimed
'swore away his life.' Never shall I for
get his fortitude when his last hour had
come. It is customary when men are pre
paring for this final trial to give them a
glass of whisky to strengthen their
nerves. When Majors -as offered a glass
of liquor he turned to me and in a voice
full of emotion said: 'I cannot take it, I
shall go to the scaffold sustained by a
power stronger than that contained in the
glass.' ffgKj^-MBBgjJPpB-^gPffiffi
"When Majors was making a disposal of
his effects he sent the Bible that had af
forded him all the comfort that he had to
his wife. On the blank leaf he wrote a
touching, loving letter to his son Archie,
in which he advises him never to handle
or touch intoxicating drinks. He told him
to love and care for his brother Abe, and
to be a comfort and mainstay of his
mother's future life, concluding with sen
sible advice for patterning bis future ca
reer." * *.'-â 'â *
The namo of Father Akerley is written
distinctly in the Bible and Mr*. Wagner
has always felt that it had a significance
and she has frequently begged her son
Archie to call on Father Akerley to learn
if there wis anything: he had to tell.
She, herself, could never gain the courage
to talk over her husband's death with Mr.
Akerley, fearing that she could not bear
up under, the recital of going over the ter
rible sorrow of the past.
Father Ackerlev, on account of his inter
est in Lloyd Majors, will now come for
ward and help 'to save his son from the
penitentiary.
The case against Mrs. Wilmore of re
ceiving- stolen property was concluded to
day before Judge Wood and taken under
advisement on a motion to dismiss. A
decision will be rendered on Wednesday.*
During the testimony it appeared that the
boys had burned the will of Frank Girard
that: they had taken, from his safe when
they blew it up.
â¢' Friends of In a Wilmore have taken her
from the Chabot Home. The girl went to
court last Wednesday in charge of a detec
tive, but 'when the court, adjourned she
was not to be found. She is with Chris
tian friends who have decided to look after
her future welfare.
Several efforts .were made by sym
pathizers to secure the: intervention of
Governor Budd on behalf of the boys. The
Governor, however,; caused it to be known
that he would only act in such a case on!
the recommendation of the Prison "Di
rectors.
â¢ Prison ; Director R. M. . Fitzgerald . said
this afternoon i that $ the J matter would be ;

MANHATTAN ATHLETES.
An Entertainment That Was Witnesed
by a Large Gathering of Sport-Lovers.
The Manhattan Athletic Club gave its
inaugural entertainment last evening at
its clubrooms, 1749 Mission street. Judg
ing from the interest that was manifested
by the large and enthusiastic gatheriug
of members and lovers of pure athletic
J sport it is decidedly safe to predict a most
i prosperous future for the new and enter
j prising athletic association. :
After an introductory address by one of
! the leading representatives of the club
; the following very- excellent programme
iof athletics was "carried out. The first
was a three-round boxing bout between
W. Alex and M. Shoeniield, then followed
i _ three-round contest between J. Kenny
} and F. McMahon. Professor Tronchet, j
j the champion swordsman of America and i
; professor of fencing at the Olympic Club, !
1 gave a very clever and interesting exhibi- I
! tion of fencing with Professor Orion. The
i club-swinging exhibition by Harry Belden
was loudly applauded, as was also the
four-round boxing bout between Dal Haw
kins and Charles Reno.
1 H. Peppers and Joe Kennedy, Gus
Muller and Jim Lucey, Hogan and Riley,
"Deacon" Jones and J. Lawlor, F. Muller
and Tom Lynch, and Young Corbett and
i A. Lyngreen appeared in three-round set
! tos, which thoroughly pleased the large
gathering ot sport-lovers.
i ;;'. Kelly, Marlowe and James Donohue
j sang some popular songs and William Le
! more gave a very clever exhibition on the
! trapeze. -
Taken altogether the entertainment was
j decidedly successful and reflects much
credit on the managers. The officers are:
C. A. Reno, president; P. C, Shacfer, vice
'â  president; James Killeen, secretary; J. B.
Gallagher, recording secretary; J. 'B.
Riley, treasurer; Thomas Lynch, master
of ceremonies; <Â». W. Merles, captain; K.
C. Muller and Thomas Kennedy, trustees.
The officers will leave no stone unturned
to make the Manhattan Club one of the
! most popular athletic associations on the
! Pacific Coast.

peared before Judges Joachimsen'and Low
i yesterday for sentence. They all declared
: they had gone out of the business. In the

THE MAYOR HAD A SECRET
IHe Was Once a Professional
Tenor in a Grand Opera
â¢ Troupe.
i
HIS CHILDREN ALL MUSICIANS.
Mr. Davie Did Not Wish to Have to
y "Sing" Himself Into
Office.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 2. â¢ J â 
No one would have known that Mayor
Davie was once a favorite tenor opera
singer had he not told the secret himself
while listening to "Carmen" last Thurs
day flight. The Mayor attended^ alone,
and some of his friends asked him to ex
plain his desire for a solitary feast of grand
opera.
"Twenty-five years ago," said the Mayor,
"I was the tenor soloist in an opera com
pany, and we made a tour of the Eastern
States. We met with considerable success
both in this country and in England. . For
many years I sang in English, French and
Italian opera, and then I had a splendid
tenor voice. I finally abandoned the life
because there was 'so much roving at
tached to it, and I am of a disposition that
likes to settle in one place. I thought,
perhaps, I might meet some of my old ac
quaintances in the operatic- line in the
Ta vary Company, but they are all new to
me. â â .â¢â¢ I gave up the business about 1876.
and for over twenty years have not sung
for anybody but my children.
"My father was a well-known musician
and my children are little musical prodi
gies. Their voices are beautifully modu
lated and they sing together perfectly. I
am training them, and they are natural
musicians. Either of them may adopt
music as a profession, as they all. have
sufficient talent to guarantee success. 1
am not at all anxious though to have it
known that I am a professional singer or 1
should get no peace hereafter. I have
carefully avoided giving publicity to this
portion of ray career fcr prudential rea
sons." . '...-. - '___â !
The "prudential reasons" his Honor
refers to are very apparent to the voters of
this county. When Alex Rosborough, the
comedian and State wharfinger, was
elected Tax Collector three years ago,
everybody, himself included, concurred in
the .opinion that he had sung himself
into office. At a ? political meeting the
dullness of the "views" of candidates is
agreeably enlivened by a few comic selec
tions, and Alex was soon made aware of
this.
When the Mayor again goes before the
people a year hence it is safe to assume
that he will be frequently called upon to
render, : "Oh! promise me," without the
back action that seems to distinguish the
ante-election promises of most of Oakland's
politicians. : - . ~: "."â 
NO WORK AT BERKELEY.
The Wet Weather Kept the
Students From Their Picks ;
and Shovels.
Proposed Monument for the University
Library to Commemorate the
Labor Movement.
BERKELEY, Cat,., March 2.â On ac
count of the heavy fall of rain last night
the student labor brigade did not turn out
to-day to complete their work of excavat
ing and making pathways across the
campus. The day was practically a holi
day so far as recitations were concerned,
only a few having been held during the
early periods of this morning. Many
college men came over from San Fran
cisco and from various other points in the
immediate vicinity prepared to work, but
finding it quite impossible on account of

the dampness of the soil and the threaten
ing weather they returned to their homes.
President Kellogg, in .his address'at the
celebration -last Saturday ; night,' declared
that to-day would be a university holiday
without stating- any conditions, and on
this account the majority of the; students
stayed at home when, they found it too
wet to work.' It is generally understood,
however, that another day will be granted ;
them in which to finish their task as soon
as the weather clears off : sufficiently. * . Â.
Regent Reinstein ' came i over this after
noon to inspect the work that has already
been done ; and -find; out | just what more
needs to be done. -He stated confidently
that the ; students would be granted an-'
other day by the academic council in
which to put the finishing touches on the
work, just as soon as the weather cleared
off. :.-â }. :- i: P 7^:-;- : ;;-..;:; â ;-.,:,: .*.;*.. *'
/ "It â¢is . exceedingly gratifying," said he,
"to know that an interest has been taken
in i this labor and what" excellent results
have been !' accomplished. What } has al
ready been done is beyond my most -an
guine I expectations. I': believe Â« that at
least 95 per cent of the able-bodied male
students at the university have done some
thing toward accomplishing the work. A
large percentage them 'have been abso
lutely faultless in the matter Jol their ap
plication, having -been 7, out ? daily r and
worked hard continuously. \
"The at -ileum have accom disked a deal
of good in the .matter of improving the
campus, but the principle which they
espoused when they took up :thÂ«-*ir picks
and shovels and '-went; to worK will be of
vastly more L benefit to the university,
since: it /Willi tend to dissipate the' idea
from the hitherto uninformed that the
University of California is made up of rich
men's sons and dude* , who are too proud
to * soil; their f hands with: honest toil. I
have been accused of having stirred up the
labor. movement purely from a selfish mo
! five. Of course this is absurd. What I
j have done for the university; little though
I it may be, has been because of my love for
1 it, and my desire to see improvements
i made where needed.
"The position of regent is the only pub- I
lie office I j ever sought and the only one 1
ever desire to hold. li. would not accept ;
even the governorship of \ this State if it j
were offered to -me to-morrow. There is
absolutely no political office in the land
to-day that I have any desire whatsoever
to hold. I apprehend that those ; who â 
started: the rumor that I am seeking no
toriety for political reasons and ulterior
motives are neither friends of myself nor
of the university."
"Josh" Is Tranformcd. 'â '*,
BERKELEY. Cal., March 2.â Josh, the I
funny paper at the university, is no longer
under the jurisdiction of the faculty. It
has undergone a complete reorganization,
and is now classed as a Drofessional period- j
ical under the management and personal j
direction of some of the U. C alumni. It
has been incorporated, and is to be the
official caricature paper of the alumni, the
Affiliated Colleges and the colleges at Berk- |
eley, so its promoters say, "Now it will be j
possible," said one of its most interested j
alumni supporters to-day, "to caricature :
and write up whomsoever we choose with
out fear of being expelled or suspended.
The only thing we will be amenable to is
the law." â¢ '777 .- : ::":-
This statement was meant as a direct
hit on the faculty of the university, who
suspended two members of the Josh staff
last fall for allowing caricatures of certain
of them to appear. It was, hinted to-day
that the next number of the comic journal
would unmercifully lampoon certain
members of the faculty at Berkeley who
do not stand in the best of favor with some
of the alumni. De Witt H.Gray, a gradu
ate in the class of '95, will serve as the
new editor. The staff of artists of the old
Josh will be retained, together with a num
ber of new ones from the Mark Hopkins
Institute. -' - .. ...
"We expect correspondence," said
Editor Gray to-day, "from members of the
Alumni Association all along the Pacific I
Coast from Mexico to Washington. It
will be the aim of the paper to establish a
closer union between the widely scattered J
alumni and other former students of the j
university."
Long Term for Reinstein.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 2.â Regent
Reinstein received word to-day from j
Governor Budd that he is to be appointed j
to a long term as regent as soon as a
vacancy occurs. The first vacancy in the i
board occurs in May, when the term of >
Columbus Bartlett expires. Mr. Rein- ]
stein will probably be appointed *to sue- â¢ i
ceed Regent Bartlett, and Timothy !
Guy Phelps to fill the remaining four |
3 ears of Mr. Reinstein's term. Reinstein
is now serving the unexpired term of Re- |
gent Ainsworth, who died last fall. Fred
W. Koch, U. C, '96, and A: W. North '96, j
went to Sacramento yesterday with a peti- !
tion to the Governor from 600 Berkeley \
students,- asking that Regent Reinstein be
appointed to the 16-year term. It is be
| lieved that the petition from the students
added much weight to the arguments in
, favor of appointing Reinstein to the long
1 term.

Snow on the Berkeley Bills.
BERKELEY, Cal.,. March 2.â The hills
, back of the university grounds presented
a beautiful appearance this morning. They
! were wuite with snow on their western
slope from crest almost to base. At an
early hour the rain changed to snow for
about thirty minutes as it fell in the low
land, but on account of the ground being
wet it melted immediately. The snow on
j the hills, however, remained throughout
' the day. The drifts in some places were
\ four feet deep. -
About forty university students climbed
j the summit of Grizzly Peak, built a fort
; and spent most of the morning snow
balling.
Preliminary Debate.
BERKELEY, Cal., March The first
preliminary debate of State University
students to select representatives for the
i next intercollegiate debate with Stanford
j will be held next Wednesday evening in
! Stiles Hall. The subject for discussion is
j a resolution "that the direct- form of elect
j ing representatives to the legislative bodies
: in this country is in all respects prefer
| able to the indirect." The same question
! will be argued ' in the intercollegiate de
bate. The debaters in the preliminary
will be J. D. Hatch, Joseph 0 Connor, J.
, It. Kelly and John Gardener for the affirm
ative and Theodore de Laguna, A. L. Weil
; and W. N. Friend for the negative.

CHIEF CROWLEY
MAY NOT RETIRE.
" Â . tt. t-|. . vn
Doubts as to His Eligibility
to Be Placed on the
Pension List.
WORDING OF THE ACT.
His Seven Years' Service by
Election May Not Be In
cluded.
LEGAL ADVICE l 6 BE TAKEN.
I
Action on His Resignation Postponed J
Till the First Meeting in
April.
Chief of Police Crowley will not retire
at least for a month and probably not for
three years yet.
The" Police Commissioners held a special
meeting last night when the Chief's resig
nation was read. The Commissioners
pointed out to the Chief that there was a
doubt as to his eligibility to be placed on
the pension list.
Section 3 of the pension act reads:
. Whenever any person, at the taking effect of
this act or thereafter, shall have been duly ap
pointed and sworn., and have served for the
period of twenty years or more as a member in
any capacity or any rank whatever of the regu
larly constituted "police department of any
â¢such county, city and county, city or town,
which may be hereafter subject to the provis
ions of this act, said board shall be ordered
and empowered to order and direct that such
person shall, after becoming 00 years of age
and his service in such police department shall
have ceased, be paid from such fund a yearly
pension equal to one-half the amount of sal
ary attached to the rank which he may have
held in said police department for one year
next preceding the expiration of said term of
twenty years.
The Chief served seven years from IS'36 to
1573 by election and has served sixteen
years by appointment. There was a doubt in
the minds of the Commissioners as to
â¢whether the seven years' service by election
could be counted in as the act says, "shall
have been duly appointed and sworn."
They therefore prevailed upon the Chief to
let tbe matter of his resignation rest until
the first meeting in April so that there
would be ample time to take legal advice
on the point.
If the seven years cannot be counted in
the Commissioners will insist upon the
Chief withdrawing his resignation so that
he can serve the full twenty years by ap
pointment.
In connection with the Chief's resign';*'
tion the following letters from Key.
Thomas Filben of the First Methodist
Episcopal Church were read:
San Francisco, March 2, 1896.
Hon, P. Crowley, Chief of Policeâ Dear Sir:
Permit me to assure you of the sympathy of a
friend and a father in the loss of your boy.
May the God of all consolation comfort you in
your bereavement.
I was on the point of sending you the above
. words when the news of your proposed resig
nation reached me. Will "you permit me as a
â¢ citizen profoundly interested in the weal of
the City to urge yon to reconsider your action.
â¢I voice the sentiment of the community and I
speak the sense of the reform elementof the
City when I say this. I need not repeat to you
my confidence in your administration gotten
from a careful canvass of it, and from
some considerable test of it in its
* relation to the work of reform now in hand
: and so heartily and effectively aided by your
department. So much is Justin sight in this
â  line and our confidence in yourself for the im
â  partial administration ot the law to this end
is so great that we cannot but feel that great
loss must come by your retiring before the
good work so well begun is completed. Never
in the history of the City was this so true as
now.
I think I know how weary and how disheart
ened you must be, but I plead for the sake of
.our City and for interests dear to you as to us
that you do not press this right of yours that
you have so well earned at this time. Sin
cerely, Thomas Filben.
San* Francisco, March 2, 1890. .
Police Commissioner Tobinâ Dear Sir: I, have
sent by this same messenger a letter to Chief
*of Police Crowley earnestly urging him not to
press his resignation at this time.
I want to say to you what I have written to
him, that those who are at present working in
the. interest of civic reform have come to prize
the efficiency of the Police Department and
the sterling worth of the Chief himself. Es
pecially for myself I want to say that having in
an official relation to test the spirit and work
of the department, in this matter we have
come to revise a judgment formed from cur
rent rumor, and are ready to bear testimony
to the efficiency of the department in chief
Crowley's hands, and his own readiness to be
at.our service in every way for the public good
and to enforce the law without fear or favor.
We are disturbed lest some of the good work
now in hand, and much already accomplished
. without any flourish of trumpets by the police
under his direction may be jeopardized by the
change.
I trust he will think better of his purpose
and that as the passing of the days help heal
the sorrow of his heart in the loss of his boy.
* he will heed the call of his fellow-citizens and
â  give himself for all the days that he shall still
! have strength to this work, than which none
is more important in the City, and for which
no one is more competent, both by reason of
his ability and by virtue of the increasing con
fidence of the community, than he. Sincerely,
B__Bl Thomas Filben.
The Chief, after the meeting had ad
journed, expressed himself as greatly grati
fied by the contents of Key. Mr. Filben's
letters, which were entirely unexpected by
him. It was a source of great gratification
to him to find such a kindly recognition of
; his services from such a source.
."I never had a doubt," said the Chief,
"but that my seven years' service in the
department by election would be included
.in my claim to be placed on the pension
list, and it was exceedingly kind of the
Commissioners to call my attention to the
fact that it was open to doubt.
"They do not want me to resign, but if I
insisted I feel sure the Legislature would
pass an amendment to the pension act to
cover my case. The matter will be laid
before able attorneys and we will see what
decision ' they arrive at. I do not, of
Â course, want to retire and lose my pen
sion, as it would be all I would have to
live ''TSBBBOSSSm

The communication and resolutions of
the California State Protective Association
regarding the reform of abuses in the
liquor traffic, which were published in last
Thursday's Call, were read at the meeting
of the Commissioners, and action thereon
postponed for ten days.
Policeman Anthony Sweeney, who
joined the force in December last, was dis
missed from the department for being in
toxicated while on duty, and for the same
offense Policeman Thomas Callahan was
fined $100. A charge of incivility pre
ferred by a lady against Sergeant Colby
was dismissed, and the sergeant was fully
exonerated. -
CHARGED WITH BURGLARY.
Quick Capture of Hurry Viley and Wil
liam Frisco. .
Harry Viley, a young man, was arrested
about a week ago for stealing, two boxes of
hats from. the store of McGiffen Bros., 136
Third street. To the surprise of the ar
resting officers the case was dismissed by
Judge Low on Saturday.
Yesterday Viley was arrested by Police
men T. L. Ryan and J. Tyrell and Special
Officer Con Kelly, on the charge of burg
lary. William Prisco, another youth, was
later arrested on the same charge.
Between Saturday night and yesterday
morning the tailor-shop of Cederbloom it
Dyhr, 410 Kearny street, had been entered,
and a suit of clothes, a pair of trousers,
shears and mathematical instruments
stolen. The police were notified, and
Ryan, Tyrell and Kelly found all the
stolen articles in- Viley 's room, 119 Fifth
street.
After his arrest he confessed to the
burglary and told the officers where they
could find the suit of clothes.
AT THE CITY PLAYHOUSES.
Frederick Warde Makes His
First Appearance as King
Lear.
Canfield at the Columbiaâ
Float at the Grand Opera-House.
Other Matters.
Frederick "Warde made his first San
Francisco appearance last night at the
Baldwin Theater in the character of King
Lear.
On the whole, the actor proved himself
to be a capable exponent of the role. He
subdued his melo-dramatic tendencies to a
great extent and played the part of the
afflicted old king in a key more true to
life than has been the case in some of the
modern plays in which Warde has ap
peared lately.
The tempest scene, although a little spun
out, was a fine piece of acting on "Warde's
part, and the scene in Cordelia's tent was
touching and sincere. All through the
drama, however, Warde's interpretation of
Lear was even and artistic.
The support was, on the whole, satisfac
tory, particularly on the part of the men.
Miss Fanny Gilletie's Cordelia was a little
hard and unsympathetic. The sisters'
parts of Miss. Lucia Moore and Mrs. Isabel
Waldron might with advantage have been j
harder. The play was well staged and
costumed.
At the Columbia.
Eugene Canfield, the bright particular
| star of the Fireman's Funmakers, is in no
danger of a diminution of his luster by
comparison with the lesser lights of the
company. Indeed these lesser lights arÂ«,
almost without exception, dim. James H. i
Bradbury as a grandiloquent rain king,
Percy Vere as an agile collector, and Bessie
Shorthand, pert and business-like, are
painstaking in their respective roles and
contribute much to the fun of the evening.
But Canfield's drollery alone is well worth
the price of admission, even should he
chance to play a solo part throughout the
evening. He is a master of facial expres
sion and his mild grimaces remind one of
Sol Smith Russell's serious but mirth
provoking countenance. He bids fair to
become as illustrious a prince of low com
edy as Russell is in the more refined do
main of dramatic humor.
The story includes a successful exhi
bition of a rain-machine, the frantic ex
ploits of a cut-rate ticket broker, the fre
quent expulsions of a collector, the divis
ion of a fortune and the location of every
body in a home on Knob Hill.
At the Grand.
Gilbert and Goldie in their comic spe
cialties are a drawing feature at Morosco's
Grand Opera-house this week. They ap
pear at the most unexpected times, when
the ladies of the audience are waxing tear
ful or nervous over the threat of
a tragic situation, and dispel all
fears with laughter. They' appear upon
one of the floating roofs in the flood scene,
and while the mimic waters are presaging
destruction and death, Goldie tells Gilbert
about his father's convivial habits, which
were so confirmed that a hackman had to
take him to his last drink, because he
couldn't walk fine.
The scenic effects of the flood scene are
copied from the sketches in Harper's
Weekly after the Johnstown disaster. The
audience was much entertained by the
surprise on the bridge, when "some itin
erary workmen," whom the hero Called
tramps, gave a young fop , a ducking, and
when all made way for the train that
rumbled across, seemly to their peril.
The play has all the dramatic elements
of an insolvent squire, one good lover, one
bad, a murder, a villain foiled and ulti
mate happiness for all but the plotter.
The acting falls short of the situations
often, the tragic appearing to be the comic
more than once. â 
Grover'B Alcazar.
A good performance of Auber's pretty opera,
"Fra DiavaJo," was given last night at Grover's
Alcazar. XV. T. Carleton, who played the title
role, was said to be suffering from a severe
cold, but it did not affect his voice to any pal
pable extent. He played his part with the
required dash and deviltry.
Miss Kena Atkinson made a charming Zer
tlna, both vocally and histrionically. Her
singing of "On Yonder Rock" was especially
applauded. Jay C. Taylor was a heroic Lo
renzo; the score suited his voice well and he
played the role with a good deal of animation.
The other characters were in good hands and
the chorus and orchestra did their work well.
- Tivoli Opera-House.
"Kip Van Winkle 1 last night, at the Tivoli
Opera-house, was one of the best performances
that have been given there for some time. The
pretty opera was well sung and acted, and the
staging was exceptionally good.
Carrie Roma, who made her reappearance at
the Tivoli, in the role of Gretchen, ; was in as
good voice as ever, and acted as pleasantly.
. She was warmly welcomed by her iriends in
the audience ' and â : was frequently encored."
KateMarchi made a coquettish Katrina and
little Pearl Landers- and little Gertie Carlisle
were effective in the children's roles.

impression ! of California and a 'very : de
cided admiration for- the music of the
Mongolians.
The* great pianist differs with John L.
Sullivan, Miss Blanche Walsh, J. J. Cor
bett, for whom 'Corbett. road is said
to have , been named, and.: other em
inent histrions in at least one par
ticular. He does not consider San Fran
cisco a "jay town." *
"I had anticipated much pleasure from
my visit to San Francisco," Paderewski
said. "My expectations . have' been 'ex
ceeded in every particular. My reception,
the kindly hospitality ' extended me, the
glorious City, its hills and its sunshine,
the appreciation and sympathy exhibited
at my recitals were far above my most
sanguine hopes, and still I had looked
forward to a great deal."
"And were the < financial' results what
you expected?" was asked.
â  "Indeed, yes. In fact, our returns were
far greater than we had figured upon."
"And what, of all things, impressed you
the most?"
"The wonder of it all!" he exclaimed
promptly.
"The wonder of it all?" was queried.
"Yes," he explained, "that it should be
here at all. v I went to San Mateo. â¢ To be
sure I had seen more elegant country

lawn and woodland. But when I remem
bered that fifty years ago there was noth
ing, that the country was regarded by the
rest of the world as a wild desert, I actu
ally could not >:; grasp 'it * all. The giant
strides that; have been made in changing
these places- from uncultivated wilder
nesses rto , resorts, replete ' with i every.' de
sirable feature of the highest civilization,
astounded me. T . .
"And San Francisco affected me the
same way. - The â¢ magic growth of - such a
mighty and Cmagnihcent ity would be im
possible anywhere else.
; "Next to the marvel of the City's being
I think Chinatown interested me the most.}
That and the wide liberality of the people.
Why," he added, "I understand that on
one Sunday a thousand Frenchmen may
parade the : streets T singing i '.'La' Mar- ;
seilleise'Tarid â  that Americans, Germans,
Italians and -Russians all look on with in
terest and ; never interfere; and that the
next week the Italians : may occupy the
streets, or the "Germans, or the Irish," and
that t never .'â  is T there clashing. : I don't
know where that could be elsewhere." '.*..'*
Paderewski said tnere was one thing he
regretted greatly.: i That was that he had
not been able to meet and know intimately
some of the many people to whom he ; was
really indebted for 'favors." T
"I f- do < not mean those ;â¢â  who .would be
merely : curious ; about ' __Â«, you kae v 4 " _"â¢
explained. "There is nothing more weari
some than -those crushes where most of
the people dole out the same quantity and
quality of flattery while others expect you
to flatter them. I mean the really sym
pathetic people whom I would Â» want for
friends. But I was so busy," he said f with
a. smile; "I had so much to do and see
when I was not practicing or playing that
I really could not find the time." .
One of the principal things the great
pianist allowed himself to do was to revel
in Chinatown and its bizarre attractions,
Night after night he went through the
Chinese quarter lavishing largesse *on â ; all
that pleased him till all Chinatown rang
with the wonderful tales of the generous
stranger, with the long, flowing hair, who
would listen sympathetically to anything
odd.. â¢<;-.-;â¢ T * ;. T
One of the first courtesies extended by
Paderewski to Marsick, the violinist, was
to take him into the Chinese' quarter.
Accompanied by one or two friends they
went to one of the merchants' clubs on
Jackson street. An orchestra of string
and wind instruments was there in waiting
with a vocalist of high repute, who sang
women's, parts at the theater.
The orchestra waited more than an hour
beyond the appointed time. They had
heard of the great musicians that they
were to play for, and they were anxious to
exhibit their skill.
When Paderewski and Marsick were ap
proaching the broom, word was passed
up that they were coming. The band at
once - began a . clamor of music of '. the
wildest kind. This continued after the
visitors had entered and were seated.
The two noted artists sat together
beside a small table. They were inter
ested in the music and utterly oblivious
to everything else. * The Chinese i band
played, on, and the musicians looked* as
unconscious as if the presence of their
great visitors had not been, anxiously
looked forward to for several hours.
Both Paderewski and Marsick leaned for
ward listening intently. Their heads almost
touched as they nodded the time to the
music and accentuated the rhythm with
extended hands. Once in awhile one
would raise his voice and sing the air the
vocalist was screeching. . An affirmative
nod would, follow from the other, who,
perhaps, would join the | chorus or make
some remark upon the peculiarity of the
music.'' â¢ " * ' '. *'
For an hour the concert proceeded. At
times the music was - slow and compara
tively soft. Again it would be shrill and
loud, and the movement rapid. Every
change was noted by the auditors, who be
came greatly interested in the various in
struments. H_BB
Paderewski was - particularly pleased
with a bamboo flute. ' This had a. sad,
sweet tone, fÂ»ven. when. Chinese airs were
-issuing 'from it. A species of mandolin
also excited his curiosity, while the ear
piercing, flageolet,. with ; its bagpipe-like
tone was not so favored. T.
Marsick was more pleased with the little
two-stringed fiddle, which, has a head like
a mallet. He took it in his hand and tried
to play. His method of holding the in
strument caused much amusement to the
Chinese and he abandoned all attempts to
play on it after having succeeded ;in win
ning several plaintive shrieks from the
unwilling strings. But he admired the
rattlesnake skin that covered the head of
the fiddle. T
: "There is no doubt that the Chinese
play tunes," Paderewski said, in discuss
ing, this music. "But, listen as I could, I
only discovered two. There may be others,
of course, â  but at the i theater, at . the tern-
pie, at the restaurants, at the clubs and in
the houses we did not enter these same
tunes were being -layed.: Both i were of
the same general class. â¢ 7 '
;, "There were orchestral ; embellishments
and additions, but there were 'never varia
tions. The same tune - was ; repeated S over ,
and over again. 'Sometimes it was"; faster
and sometimes 'slower, v Again, the t long
banjo with the snake-skin head would in
troduce a tremolo/ effect. > The '; extra , fid
dles would make additional flourishes,' and
'bang ! bam; !'. the great cymbals v would
mark Â£* some emphatic ; feature, and the
rattle of the drums would be; introduced,
but the same tune whs there all the time." ,
,; , "What was that tune?" was asked.
' Paderewski hummed it, beating the time
with his hand. A request that he write it
met with a decided nod in the negative. â¢?:â ;
"Oh, no; I could not . think of it," he
said. . -;:' â  Â- â  /..;.-.
"But why?" â¢; -
'â¢; "Well; you see, understand that 1 there
is i a man who is ? making , a r study of ? the
Chinese music. T-Now: I have f- been inter
ested, but I have only observed, not:stud
ied. So, if I should write it as I remember
it, I might get it wrong. Then some one
would : say : j 'The I ridiculous * fellow ! -On
what can he base L any claim i, to i knowing
music when he can understand no '.better
than that ? Why, it is full of errors IT â¢ : t , â  .

__ I **.'^_'? stold * at - 4 was his impression of
the Chinese music that was wanted slt
was explained that if a copy of the Chi
nese music was "* desired it could be ob
tained at any time by sending an ordinary
musician with a quick ear to write it down :
Paderewski's impression of the Mongolian
tune could only be written by himself
_ Paderewski promised to write the music.
It was not till he was in his private car
bound for San Jose on Friday night that
he, wrote it, however. Then he wrote a
few bars before the train started. The
jolting of the- cars soon prevented further
work, but a fac-simile of that which was
completed is given. Â:
When asked, if he were contemplating
practing upon his newly acquired Chinese
instruments, and perhaps evolving some
new style â¢of music, 'â¢ Paderewski gave a
smiling negative. * v- 'â â â -,
"No, no," he said, "I will not play on
them. I will consider them as curiosities
only, to be hung on the studio walls. .Still,
it may be that I will; for my own' amuse
ment, try to reproduce the Chinese music
at times." a Ww_ffl|B^|'| t |ff 1 f WJ.lHl wniiiii
M. Marsick was -riot at all enthusiastic
about the accomplishments of the Chinese
musicians. He said it was the one thing in
music on which he differed in opinion from
Paderewski. T
"I was amused by the . orchestra," he
said, "but not interested. . It .was not
music how could it be with such primi
tive instruments? * But Tit* represented
something typical of a strange race and so
was worthy of marked attention."
GORI'S GLASSY GLARE
It -Is Turned Relentlessly Upon
the Lega Socialista
Italiana.
! A Meeting at Apollo Hall Which De
veloped Some Bitter Expres- .
v sions of Antagonism.
The Italian socialists of this City were
among the most fervid of Pietro Gori's ad
mirers when that noted anarchist first be
gan his propaganda . here. . For nearly a
month , Gori and I the Lega . Socialista
Italiana dwelt together in harmony, but
now the 'â  friendship has 'given place to
mutteringa of wrath and â  the glad hand
has \ been exchanged for the glassy eye. In
fact a feud has arisen which nothing can
quench but a great mass-meeting.
Gori says that socialists are greater
enemies to freedom than is the Czar of all
the Russia-. The socalists say that Gori
is a dangerous, seditious person, , against
whom all true lovers of freedom should be
warned, and the strife has waxed so high
that arrangements are being made to hold
a grand debate in Metropolitan Temple
next Monday, at which the socialists and
the anarchist^ will argue out their differ
ences in English and Italian.
The first rift within the lute occurred
last Sunday afternoon, when the Italian
Socialists (La Lega "â â  Socialista Italiana)
held a meeting in Apollo HalL; presided
over -by Griseri Dall' Obrico. Pietro Gori
had . been invited ;toI be . present, in order
that those seeking knowledge in the ways
of anarchy could question him 'â  and have
their â * curiosity gratified. It was arranged
that discussions should be limited to five
minutes, and all was going swimmingly
when Arturo Conti took the floor, and to
use a colloquialism "sailed into" the an
archists in a way that made Gori and his
partisans almost doubt their ears, for till
that time they bad fondly believed that
Mr. Conti had taken them under his wing.
rln the â course of his ', remarks Arturo
Conti explained how he had been led to
preside at some of Gori's lectures \ and
afterward found it his painful duty to con
demn all he taught, j "For the first two
lectures I believed Pietro Gori to be a good
socialist, but his later lectures revealed
him in his true character. He is the friend
of capital, for he advises his followers to
abstain from voting, and is not that play
ing into the hands of the capitalists?"
After making a . number of remarks
about anarchists, which were â  entirely the
reverse of flattering, . Signor Conti sat
down and Signor Gori too- the floor, pre
pared to combat with all his eloquence for
the principles of anarchy. He was- told
that he must observe- the five minutes'
rule, which filled the cup of his wrath
against the socialists full to the brim.
"Ah! you socialists! you do not know
what liberty is!" he cried; fiercely. "You
strangle the words back in my throat with
your five-minute* regulations. Is . a man
not to have freedom of speech? I scorn to
answer you now. but I will hold a meeting
of anarchists, to which L will invite you.
There I will speak and you tyrants shall
have five hoursâ years, centuries, if
you likeâ in which to answer me. SI will
show you what the future base of society
is to be." ' _â â¢â â  Tâ¢ -
Ana protesting Pietro Gori
dashed out of the hail, followed by about
a third of the audience, which took this
opportunity of showing that it had enlisted
itself under the anarchist banner.. : *"' ,r
When the footsteps â¢â of the departing
anarchists had died away in the distance
E. Bettini and Alvin Appel successively
took the floor and said what they thought
of that kind of people. .'/...,-
L. Nathan, who spoke next, said that,
for his part, he would have liked to com
pare socialism with anarchy face to face
with Gori, and he considered it an act of
cowardice on the part of the anarchists to
abandon the hall. :
This taunt at the departed one. was
more than some of the socialists who were
wavering a little in their allegiance could
stand. . A. Barlotti jumped to his feet and
called upon Mr. Nathan to either retract
the word "coward" or leave the platform.
The latter said that the word escaped his
lips before he was aware of â  it, â  but Gori's
friends in the audience were not satisfied.
They demanded a . public discussion, in
which the ; anarchist could take his own
part without being tied by any five-min
ute time limit,. and finally it was decided
that a public discussion should be held.
Yesterday Arturo Conti â  agreed to take
the meeting in charge. -Nathan speaks no
Italian and Gori very little English, but it
was decided that an interpreter should be
-resent to translate Gori's words into Eng
ish and Nathan's into Italian. The mass
meeting that is the outcome of the diffi
culties between the socialists and an
archists will probably take ; place next
Monday in Metropolitan Temple.

HAVANA TOBACCO CULTURE
Final Success of an : Enterprising
Californian's Experi
ment. X'
J. D. CULFS PERSEVERENCE.
/ â  ;777 : ' :c ''â â 'â â ' â ?â 
Expectations That Immense Profits
Will Be Realized From the
New Industry.
Eight hundred dollars net an acre, is
what J. D. Culp of San Felipe will make
out of his tobacco for the next five years,
under a contract recently entered into
with one of the leading cigar manufac
turers of this City. Mr. Culp has de
voted thirty-five years to the culture of
Havana tobacco in California, and through
out all of his experiments, failures and
partial triumphs he' has been satisfied,
notwithstanding the prejudice of smokers
against domestic cigars, that California
could grow a tobacco equal to the Ha
vana product. That he has been able to
contract his crop for the next five years at
such favorable prices would/seem to bear
out his judgment. .
In an interview Mr. Culp imparted a
deal of information, both practical and
technical, upon the subject to which he
has devoted the greater part of his life
time. He said :
"If the people ould realize the immense
profits to be derived from growing tobacco
in California and the many advantages
this State has over any other in the Union
in this regard, the subject would com
mand more attention. Hailstorms, which
are *so destructive to tobacco crops in
Eastern â  States, are almost unknown here.
-There are no droughts in the tobacco area
of California, and during my thirty-five
years' experience, in which time I "have
cultivated as much as 900 acres in S one
season, I have not expended $35 in ridding
the plants of worms, which are a bother
some and expensive pest in the East.
During a period of four years I hardly law
a worm in my tobacco fields. When they
did make their appearance ; the yellow
jackets and a fly kept them pretty well
thinned out. The Eastern tobacco-grower
is compelled to expend $100 an acre an
nually for fertilizers, and even then the
tobacco fields of Pennsylvania and Con
necticut are playing out. ; These fields used
to produce first-class cigar wrappers, but
the product is now used for binders.
Instead of needing fertilizers out here we
have to tone down the soil. Irrigation is
unnecessary on my land, but where the
soil is light it might be necessary to give
the plants a start when they are set out.
"My fields are laid out in two-acre
tracts, and provided with windbreaks. No
dust accumulates on the plants. I get two
crops in a year. I The first crop will average
1000 pounds to the acre, one-half of which
can be utilized for cigar-wrappers. The per
centage of wrappers of tobacco grown in
Havana is about one-quarter of the crop.
My second crop is from suckers, and will
yield 500 pounds,' but with. a much smaller
percentage of leaf , fit for wrappers." â¢
"Do you import your seed every year
from Havana?" Mr. Culp was asked.
"I believe this is the only part of the
United States where Havana tobacco re
mains true to its species; where the seed
year after year reproduces the same kind
and quality of tobacco. The cigar you are
smoking is from seed Drought out from
Cuba and first planted here fifteen years
_ .-..-.. -
ago. ;"",..
"The best Havana tobacco is grown dur
ing the dry . season. The crop is not so
large as one produced with plenty of
moisture, but the quality is better, and I
will tell you why: .A tobacco leaf consists
of two skins, between which is a cellular
formation. Upon the upper skin or epi
dermis are numerous hairy protuberances,
which under microscopic examination are
found to be the lungs of the plant. At the
apex of these hairs is a small poisonous
deposit or tobacco gum, composed largely
of paraffine, a bitter extract, and an es
sential oil which imparts the . aroma to a
cigar. Much ' rain washes this resinous
substance off and thereby impairs the to
bacco. Chemists have claimed that the
flavor of Havana tobacco is due to a low
percentage of nicotine; but I have satis
lied myself that it is in this deposit of
gum. I have a large ball of it which I have
collected. It is very susceptible to varying
temperature, becoming soft ana plastic in
a heat equal to that of the midday sun*
of a summer day, and perfectly; hard in
the temperature that would prevail after
nightfall. \
"Did you ever notice the wilted appear
ance of a tobacco plant during a hot day,
and how vigorous and strong it appears in
early morning? When the weather is very
warm the escape of the gases essential to
vegetable life, owing to the softened con
dition of this gum, is . detrimental to the
health of the plant.
; "In this connection I have, made an
other discovery. Spots on â¢ tobacco leaves
have been â¢" attributed to ; various causes,
and the average smoker bunts for a cigar
with that sort of wrapper on it under the
misapprehension that he is getting some
thing superior." When there is a break in
one of these hairs the substance which is
deposited in these cells, and makes the
essential part of tobacco, exudes; that part
of the leaf dies, and the spot is the result.'.'
â¢ "What of the old Consolidated Tobacco
Company and its failure?" .
''â¢That was due to causes outside of the
merits or quality of the tobacco. Of course
the tobacco was inferior to what it now is.
We did not pretend to grow wrappers at
that time. And to show the prejudice
that existed against a home product, and
exists in a lesser degree to-day, we used a
great ; deal of -Pennsylvania tobacco for
wrappers, and cigars made wholly out of
the Pennsylvania crop were, in the opinion
of * many local smokers, rank with the
taste of Gilroy soil. :. The company was or
ganized in 1872, and it must be apparent
that twenty-three years of experience since
then has made a valuable addition to our
stock of information ' ; on the subject of
crowing Havana tobacco in California." '
â  "Do you know how much tobacco is an
nually imported by the United States?" .
'â  "About :. $30,000,000 : worth, principally
from Cuba * and ;.,' Sumatra. The i area ;on
which tobacco is grown in Cuba is 21 by 71
miles and contains 16,000 plantations.: The
approximate value of the annual product
is $23,000,000. In California we have ten
times that area when- tobacco can be suc
cessfully grown j and 'â  there are sections of
Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Southern
Texas adapted to its growth. . These facts
will convey an idea of the vast possibilities
of. the industries if -we. can produce a to
bacco that will compare with * the Cuban
article. ",*T T . .. '- T -
|;^ F. W. Briggs, the - manufacturing tobac
conist, was also interviewed and expressed'
the i opinion T that ' the prejudice \ of :-'; the
smoker was the only thing j that prevented
the [ complete success of the domestic ar
ticle. 7 "If," said Mr. ; Briggs, - "we can
grow â a ; tobacco which in appearance *is
identical with; Havana! tobacco and which
will ii deceive * the â¢' oldest f smokers, why
should we not encourage and", promote the
industry and 5 thereby add 'to i the wealth
and popular reputation of : California?"
' T Jacob Brandt had similar opinions. He
has devoted many years to the s tobacco
business, and is willing to stake his repu
tation and money on the proposition.
: . A. Rosenshine,- of the firm of i M.Rosen
shine & < Bro., frankly confessed â¢' that -he
bad smoked some of the California goods
and thought they were ; from ; Cuba. : "I
think," he said, "I am a pretty good judge
of cigars, but they fooled me." T .'7 > , '. -
; Â« M "tP. Kohlberg said : '% "It >is the ; finest
tobacco outside of Cuba; "compares favora
. bly i with much of ; the Havana tobacco. It
is a fine } smoke. The $ aroma'; is * delicate,'
and the cigar in appearance coula not be
distinguished f ram Havana goods." Â£* '-*
"7 M. J. Joseph, of Esberg, Bachman & Co.,
Â« n id- "I have been in â  the tobacco busi
be-ween the California!! and Cuban pro
* William Lewis thought it a Â«ne tobjeco,
with "â¢_ better taste than any other do
mestic filler." is an extract^ letter
The following is an extract from Â£ Jewsr
written by a '-ember of a lead>np ->ew
York tobacco house: ;; The Tf t ? a ba^? t th0 h * P
peals to me individua ly. ; : It *â¢Â°â¢
doubt the best domestic tobacco^ave
ever smoked and I consider it has an im
mense future. I have also _ K^en a few
cigars to mv Spanish and Cuban friends
and none ;of them suspected on the boat
that they were smoking anything else than
a clear Havana cigar." * . Âv_y*i;_
These facts are sufficient to justify the
hope that it will not be many years before
California's tobacco crop will be eagerly
sought after.' The culture of tobacco cer
tainly offers an opportunity for the farm
ers o"f this State to â  produce something
more profitable than wheat and barley.
Mr. Culp has developed the business to a
point where < failure is improbable, and
with a knowledge of his experience sue-
cess seems to be assured.
