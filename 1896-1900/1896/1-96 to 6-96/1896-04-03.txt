Benor del Vnlle is a man of culture and
intelligence and has no leaning toward the

biased. He says Spanish troops are kill

In many parts of the island the troops
residences and estates and |
kill unarmed men. Unquestionably they
are more to be feared tnan the insurgents.

JEridtnee Given by a Spy Employed by
the Spanish.
' NEW YORK, N. V.. April This
morning the case of the Government,
against B. J. Bueno, Captain Sam Hughes,
Johji D. Hart, Captain Lawrence Brabazon
' and Benjamin Guerrera, charged with
having, violated the neutrality laws by aid
ing.and abetting an alleged Cuban filibus
tering expedition on the steamship Ber
hiuda, was opened in 1 the criminal branch
;of the .United States Circuit Court before
â¢Judge Brown.
t * '.'lf vre were hot citizens of the United
Mate-.' said the Assistant District Attor-
n ey in opening for the prosecution, "some,
if not all of up, might be glad to take part
in a military expedition that would aid
> the Cuban insurgents who are to-day
fighting against the tyrannical laws of
Spain, but the .Revised Statutes forbid our
, doing so, and make our acting or abetting
expedition a high misdemeanor.
That is what the accused are charged
'withâ up arms against a foreign
power, the kingdom of Spain, with which
tDe United States is now at peace."
. Â° The examination of witnesses was then
begun.
August Outerbridge testified that the
Bermuda had. been transferred from the
"Quebec Steamship Company through him
to Thomas A. Thompson, the checks in
3 avnJent being given by Mr. Walsh of the
firm of Bennett. Walsh & Co.
'â¢ ..William S. Walsh, sbipbroker, testified
nat he had conducted the negotiations for
;the purchase of the vessel from the Quebec
"Company with Mr. Outerbridge. He had
The San Francisco Call.
purchased the steamship at the instance
of John D. Hart, who had telephoned from
Philadelphia that he wanted to buy a
steamer suitable for a fruit boat. He had
paid $2.5,000 for the vessel. : Witness had
received the first payment in the shape of
a $5000 check from Benjamin Guerrera, by
whom it was signed. -
George K. Murray, the fire department
inspector of combustibles, testified to the
explosive character of the lighter J. S. T.
Stranahan, which it is claimed was one of
the vessels employed in loading the Ber
muda.
Counsel for the defense objected to this
testimony, but the court overruled it.
â  Then a proclamation of peace between
the United States and Spain, made by the
President of the United States, was offered
in evidence, but despite objection by the
defense Judge Brown allowed it to be
read.
The report of Edward A. Mahnken, an
inspector of customs, who examined the
; cargo of the Stranahan, was offered in cvi- ]
dence. He denied that the Government
officials had any right to either seize or
detain the cargo of the Stranahan, and said
that the Attorney-General rebuked the
District Attorney for having caused the
detention by restoring the cargo to its
owners.
Felix A. Fuenta?, a Spaniard, testified
that he nad seen a man whom he believed
to be General Calixto Garcia at the head
quarters of the Cuban Junta. He had
heard him addressed as Mr. Garcia. He
failed to identify any of the defendants as
having been in the office of the Junta when
he was there.
It was stated by the prosecution that the
witness had been enrolled as a member of
the Bermuda expedition by General Gar
cia. The witness told now he had offered
his services to General Garcia to go to
Cuba and the general's declination of
them : bow subsequently he became en
rolled, as he supposed, for some expedi
tion and had signed a paper. He further
stated he been given $-"1 a week for two
weeks.
The witness correctly described Garcia
as a gray-haired man with a white beard
and a scar on his forehead. The witness
said that he went aboard the steamer
Hawkins on the 23d or 24th of January
from a dock somewhere at Harlem. Then
he said that the Hawkins foundered the
day after she sailed, and he and others
were rescued by two or three vessels and
taken to Boston.
Th* witness was still on the stand when
court was adjourned until Monday.
OIWXERS FOR THE CVBAXS.
Experienced Men JfVre Shipped for the
Island on the Bermuda.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 2.â A pri
vate cablegram from Puerto Cortez to-day
would seem to show that the Spaniards
did not make as big a haul as reported, if
toe Honduras authorities have really held
the ship Bermuda.
The cablegram said that but ninety cases
of arms and ammunition were found
aboard the steamer, and that the greater
part of ncr cargo and General Calixto
Garcia and the Cubans who went out on
the vessel were landed on the coast of the I
Prorinceol Plria'f del Rib, Cuba.' â 
It is said that a number of the men who
are alleged to have been landed from the
Bermuda were expert artillerymen, and
that they gained their experience as mem
bers of Battery A, Pennsylvania National
Guards.
The story goes that twenty thoroughly
competent men were with the expedition
and that they were under command of
Sergeant W. H. Cox of Section 3, Bat
tery A, who is considered one of the best
artillery instructors and most efficient
handlers of batteries in this part of the
country.
The services of these men, it is asserted,
was secured by the Cubans for the purpose
of organizing their own men into effective
battalions and training them in the use of
guns procured from tne United States.

Success of the Seventh Expedition Kent
Out from JV> to York.
NEW YORK. N. V., April 2.â A special
to the Recorder from Wilmington, Del.,
says: Advices were received to-night by
Desato Bros., leaders of the Cuban colony
here, that another filibustering expedition
from the United States safely landed on
the northern shores of Cuba yesterday
morning, and the munitions taken from
this country will be in possession of the
insurgent army in the province of Pinar
del Rio to-day.
This expedition, which makes the sev
enth to reach the camp of the insurgents
in six weeks, started from New York on
"Wednesday night. March 25.
It consists of thirty-rive men, 300,000
cartridges, 2000 rifles and a large quantity
of powder. The name , of the ves
sel that conveyed the expedition
cannot be ascertained, although it
was hinted by local Cubans that it was a
large steamer owned by a well-known
steamship company, with headquarters in
New York.
This expedition, Ralph Desoto said, was
carefully planned and slipped out of New
York last week without arousing the
slightest suspicion on the part of the Gov
ernment official? and the detectives.

General Distribntion of Arms Among

Rumors.
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, April 2.â
A dispatch from Salisbury says that Cecil
Rhodes started on Tuesday for Buluwayo,
taking with him 150 troops. The opinion
is generally entertained that Rhodes is
fully capable of dealing with the revolt in
Matabeleland.
The Matabele revolt, according to ad
vices from Buiuwayo, is not connned to
the Matoppo Hills, where the rebellious
Matabeles are concentrated. The legisla
tive authorities of the Chartered Company
t represent that horses and an abundant
supply of arms, ammunition and pro
visions are required, and when these have
been collected it is proposed to sweep the
hills with several columns of troops of
about 250 men each. Five Hundred
mounted men are accompanying Cecil
Rhodes from Salisbury to Gwelo.
The telegraph line between Buluwayo
I and this city has been repaired. Dis
patches dated March 31 have been re
i ceived, giving details of fights with the
natives. Olimo, the instigator of the ris
ing, has proclaimed himself King of the
Matabeles.
Governor Robinson has sent a message
to President Kruger heartily thanking him
for his offer to send a burgher force to pro
tect the women and children threatened
by the rising, of the Matabeles. Governor
Robinson says he considers the force of
500 men sufficient, but adds that he is
none the less sensible of the friendly
spirit displayed by the people of the Trans
vaal.
LONDON, Exg., April 2.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Cape Town says
that 2000 rifles were sent from Johannes
burg to Pretoria on Saturday last and, to
gether with ammunition, were issued on
Sunday to Boers and railway officials.
The distribution of the arms caused the
wildest rumors, but the general opinion is
that tne arms were given out as a provi
sion against possible developments in the
i Matabele rising.
J'BEMIEB BOTROEOIS EXPJjAIXS-
Attitude of France and- Rusiia on Af
fair* in Egypt.
PARIS. France, April 2.â ln tne Cham
ber of Deputies to-day M. Bourgeois,
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
Affairs, made reply to the interpellations
submitted by MM. Delafosse, Pierre Alype
and Lebon, in which they asked for in
formation on the situation in Egypt. M.
Bourgeois declared that Great Britain had
installed herself in Egypt without having
been invested with a mandate to do so by
the powers or by the Sultan of Turkey,
and had thereby caused permanent uneasi
ness. The Sultan's mandate had not been
procured, although Egypt was a depend
ency of the Ottoman empire, whose in
tegrity the powers had agreed to respect.
The action of the Russian and French
deleeates on the Egyptian Commission in
protesting against the illegal appropria
tion of Egyptian funds for the Soudan ex
pedition has established a reservation in
regard to the Egyptian question.
M. Bourgeois added ttiat Russia and
France were never more closely associated
than at present. The Cabinet, he con
cluded, was continuing the negotiations
concerning Egypt with firmness, and ->s-as
inspired with confidence in defending with
Russia their common rights and interests.
Upon the conclusion of M. Bourgeois'
statement the Chamber, by a vote of 309 to
213, adopted a vote of confident in the
Government.
The consensus of opinion in the lobbies
is that part of M. Bourgeois' reply to the
interpellations cleaily indicate 1 ! that he
was trying to procure a conference of the
powers on the Egyptian question.

SEQUEL TO A SHORTAGE
Boys Discover the Body of Maxey
Cobb, a Missing County
Treasurer.
Before Committing Suicide He Trans

Protect Bondsmen.
LINCOLN, Nebr., April 2.â Two boys
hunting ducks on Salt Creek, near the i
State penitentiary building, three miles !
from this city, early this evening found
â  the dead body of a man in the weeds on j
j the bed of the creek. It proved to be that
j of Maxey Cobb, Treasurer of, this (Lan- â 
j caster) County. He had committed sui- 'â 
! cide, presumably by takinc poison, as
j there were no marks of violence.
This is the tragic sequel to the treasury
| shortage of nearly $40,000 which developed
last week and for which Cobb was held re
sponsible. No criminal action had been
begun against him, but he brooded over !
I the matter and a week ago he transferred '
i his life insurance to protect nis bonds
j men. Monday last he disappeared, and !
though his absence caused some conjee- !
, ture, no special alarm was felt, the ac
! cepted theory being tnat he was indulging
,in a protracted spree. His relatives and
j intimates were of this belief and urged j
: that no particular publicity be given his
| disappearance. To-day, however, an ac
tive search was begun with the accidental
discovery of the body, as stated. The re
j mains were brought to the city and an in
| quest will be held.
Cobb was one of the most popular young
men in the city and his integrity had
never been questioned. He leaves a widow.

APPROPRIATIONS FOR HARBORS
It Is Understood That Fifty Thousand
Dollars Will Be Expended at
San Pedro. /
WASHINGTON, D. C., April 2.â The
river and harbor bill is completed and in
the hands of the Government printer. It
Is understood that it will be reported t^>
the House to-morrow. The members of
the committee are reluctant to divulge the
I contents of .the bill, but it is known that
I the provision by which Santa Monica was
to have been put under the continuous
contract system has been stricken out.
As telegraphed The Call last night, the
bill appropriated $2,500,000 for Santa
Monica harbor, $100,000 to be immediately
available. The $392,000 for inner harbor
improvements at San Pedro has also been
stricken out, and it is understood that
only $50,000 will be appropriated and this
will be merely for dredging the harbor.
Oakland harbor improvements will be
put under the -."continuous contract" sys
tem, as a San Francisco paper, reported,
and only $100,000 , is appropriated for the
next fiscal year. Humboldt; harbor gets
$159,000 (under continuous contract).
The most important .provision in the
bill, however, is the following:
"For the construction of restraining bar
riers for the protection of the Sacramento
and Feather rivers in California, $250,000;
such restraining barriers to be constructed
under the direction of the Secretary of
War in accordance with the recommenda
tions of the California Debris Commis
sion, for the purposes set forth in sections
23. 24 and 2-5 of the act entitled 'An act to
create the California Debris Commission
and regulate hydraulic mining in the
State of California, approved March. 7,
1893,' provided said sum shall be available
only on condition that the Legislature of
the State of California ': shall have appro
priated at least an equal sum for | purposes
herein set forth, to be expended in accord
ance with recommendations of engineers
of the United States Government."
The foregoing is one of the largest items
in the river and harbor bill, and its inser
; tion is the. result of some splendid work in
its behalf. \Wnen the economical
tendency of the present Congress and
the fact that this is a Presidential
year is considered, it can be well under
stood that it required more than ordinary
- effort to : induce the committee to
report an item appropriating : $250,000. It
is safe to say tnat no better was ever
i done before ; the River and Harbor Com
mittee. , The h Call correspondent has
watched with much interest the active and
: organized efforts that have been made in
behalf of : the : appropriations by . powerful
| influences that have been exerted in its be
half. The California delegations ,in ; both
houses i were \ united in; its '-. support, and
j were assisted ;by J Tirey ; L. ; Ford, who lis
; here representing this and other matters.
While the matter ; had many friends upon
the ; ; River t and Harbor Committee Â£ its
stanchest advocates in the committee were
Hermann of \ Oregon ; and \ Hooker of ' New
i York,. tbe' latter being chairman of r the
I committee. ".[-' .'â  .V â ;.:;,';. J .>',. >V. v.v

i would not attempt to conceal his joy at

! in bis praises of the California delegation.
I : all of whom he said 'had worked earnestly :
I and faithfully for appropriations. He
further said that while there had been
s )n:e objections upon the part of residents
of Sacramento Valley to the proposed
work be was satistied that when it was
once begun, and its beneficial and far
reaching effects began to make themselves
manifest, it would be hailed as the har
binger of prosperity in both mountain and
valley, and would effectually solve the
problem of improved navigation on the
.Sacramento and Feather rivers.

and leaped into the stream.
Despite the effort? of the bridge-tender
and two policemen the man drowned be
fore the eyes of 200 or 300 people, who
had quickly gathered on the bridge. It is
believed to be a case of suicide; but the
bridge-tender, who saw the man jump,
says he cried for help a3 he rose the first
time.
The man had evidently just arrived in
town, as he carried a satchel. The police
worked until dark, but failed to recover
the body. A3 a high wind has been blow

There Will Be a Steep Advance in
Steel and the Production
Restricted.
NEW YORK, X. V., April 2.âRepre
sentatives of all the big steel and iron com
panies in the country held a secret meet
ing here to-day at the Waldorf. Mr. Crane
of the Illinois Steel Companj declined to
discuss the details of the programme, as
did others who were seen.
The "pool" programme, as far as could
be learned to-day, is substantially as fol
lows: To advance the price of steel billets
from $17 to $20 a ton at the makers' mills.
The production is to be restricted accord
ing to the needs of the country. There is
no combination with any European or
foreign manufacturers.
The steel representatives say that the
iron business is picking up all over the
country, and that they want to get all the
manufacturing interests together, m
| eluding the beam and structural men, so
| as to make a littie surplus to offset the de
pression and Josses of the past two or
three years.
Andrew Carnegie, the iron king, was
asked for his opinion of the general out
look in business.
"Well, business is not good," replied
he. "A general depress. on prevails and I
think we must wait until the Presidential
election is over before we can hope for gen
eral prosperity.
"After that I hope that the currency
system of the Government will be placed
upon a proper financial basis, so that we
will get rid of the agitation for a change of
standard."

claimed, several bitter personal enemies
who have been using every endeavor to
oust him, and some of the members of the
hoar : nave become convinced that they
will take immediate advantage of this de
cision of the Supreme Court and will en
deavor to impress upon the mind ol
County Auditor Cohen the absolute ne
cessity of his refusing to issue any war
rant when Royster mates his demand for
salary after the meeting of the board on.
Monday next. It is alsso claimed thai Dis
trict Attorney Ryan will render a decision
upholding Cohen in his refusal.
This alleged enmity aeainst their chosen
candidate has aroused the indignation of
several members of the board, and it 13
claimed that they threaten to retaliate by
declaring the ordinance* which fix the ra
tio of licenses throughout the county all
off, thereby reducing the revenues some
$50,000. Ibe board claims that, in reality,
they are empowered by the provisions or
the county government act to collect all
licenses as they see h"t, ana refer to subdi
vision 27 of section 25. which defines the
rights of Boards of Supervisors to levy ii
censes and fix rates thereof, and collect
the same by suit ''or otherwise."
ihi3 latter term is certainly very broad,
they say, and if they deem it advisable to
engage tne services of a collector they be
lieve they are entitled to do so under tne
provision, "or otherwise." In conse
quence, tney passed an ordinance which,
provided for the engagement of a collector,
who was to receive 5 per cent of all moneys
collected, not to exceed $125 per month.
County Auditor R. Cohen, when inter
viewed upon the subject, said: "There is
certainly no personal feeling in this mat
ter as far as lam concerned. Under the
decision of the Supreme Court I cannot
see how it is possible for me to do other
wise than refuse to issue a warrant. I shall
probably request an opinion from ths
District Attorney and act on his advice.
As far as I am concerned I am certain in
my own mind that a license collector will
more than save his salary to the county
in collecting licenses which the Sheriff
could not well bother to coliect."
District Attorney Ryan, while con
vinced that there is no provision under the
Jaw which authorized the Boara of Super
visors to employ a tax collector, says that
all licenses rnnst be collected by the Sher
iff. He also indignantly disclaims that he
has any personal or private aims to sub
serve through the removal of Mr. Royster,
and says that he deeply regrets that if
called upon for an opinion he would be
oblieed to advise, as he claims that under
the recent decision of the Supreme Court
he has no option.
In the meantime rumors are prevalent
that Sacramento County will become a
paradise to saloon men by having the
county license annulled.

GEORGE ARGUES
FOR TEN HOURS
Is Bitterly Opposed to the
Seating of Dupont of
Delaware.
NO VOTE YET REACHED.
Interesting Debates Grow Out of
Amendments to Postoffice
Appropriation Bill.
ONLY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES
Senator Gorman Objects to Giving the
Officials Power to Violate Civil
Service Rules.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.â ln the
Senate to-day Georpe of Mississippi con
cluded the speech begun by him on Tues
day and continued yesterday against the
Committee on Privileges and Elections,
declaring that Dupont was duly and le
gally elected as a Senator from the State
of Delaware. George's argument occupied
in all ten hours. It closed with an asser
tion that if Dupont obtained the seat he
would he elected to it not by the Legisla
ture of Delaware, but by ihe Senate of the
United Staler. No action was taken on
the report, and it is very uncertain when
â¢the vote will be reached.
The remainder of the day's session was
taken up in the discussion oi an amend
ment to the postoffice appropriation bill
relating to the consolidation of suburban
postoth'ces and changing them into sta
tions and sub-stations.
Reading of yesterday's journal was dis
pensed with, and t:ie Senate on motion of
Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts ordered that
the adjournment to-day be until Monday
next.
House bill granting to the Atchison and
Nebraska and to the Chicago, Burlington
and Quincy Railroad companies the right
of way over part of the Sac and Fox and
lowa Indian reservations in Kansas and
Nebraska was reported and passed.
The Delaware Senatorship case was
taken up, and George (D.) of Mississippi
began the third day's installment of his
speech against the right of Dupont to the
seat. George concluded his speech at 2:45
o'clock, having in the three days occupied
just ten hours. His summing up was that
if the Senate admitted Dupont it would
perform tbe act of electing him when the
Legislature of the State had failed to do it.
The Delaware ca^e went over without ac
tion.
The Indian appropriation bill was re
ported from the Committee on Appropria
tions by Peltigrew (R.) of South Dakota,
who gave notice that he would ask the
Senate on Monday next to take it up.
Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas asked unani
mous consent that after the postofiice ap
propriation bill is disposed of the Senate
should take up bis resolution for an inves
tigation into recent bond issues, but Hill
objected.
The postofiice appropriation bill was
taken up, the pending question being on
an amendment for an additional compen
sation for carrying the Australian mail.
The amendment was laid aside tempo
rarily and WolcotUÃ.) of Colorado offered
an amendment to regulate the compensa
tion of the postmasters in sub-stations of
cities. Wolcott's amendment was to in
sert this proviso: "Provided, that when
ever by order of the Postmaster-General
any postoffice is consolidated with any
office so as to become a station or sub
station of the same the salary of the clerk
in charge may be paid, out of the appro
priation."
Gorman (D.) of Maryland opposed the
amendment.
A Democratic Senator asked whether
the change was made for political pur
poses.
"Of course it is for political purposes,"
Gorman said, "but I don't care to speak
of that. lam against toe principle which
enables the Postmaster-General to abolish
all these small offices at his will. It is
not only un-Democratic and un-Republi
can but it is un-American. The post
masters at small postoffices are all tne
Government officials that the people have
to look to."
In the further course of his remarks
Gorman made a pointed allusion to the
question of politics as affected by post
office consolidations. The men who had
shouted most loudly for civil service re
form were using that consolidation scheme
as a powerful machine to accomplish po
litical ends.
ThÂ« discussion of the amendment was
broken in upon to allow Elkins (R.) of
West Virginia, who said he would be
absent on Monday, to make an argument
in favor of the committee amendment for
additional compensation to the Oceanic
Steamship Company for carrying the Aus
tralian mails.
No action was taken on either of the
pending amendments, and the bill was
laid aside.
The Senate at 5:40 adjourned until Mon
day next.
IKE'S ISO />!' SHIPPED.
The Murd-ered Man'a Remain* to Be In
terred in Chtcago.
CHICAGO, 111., April 2.â The body of
Oliver Pike, who was murdered in Wash,
ington State and shipped to Chicago from
Salt Lake, was this afternoon taken by the
uncle and cousin to Fulton, Ohio, whence
it will be transferred to Fayette, the old
home of the murdered man, for burial.
The friends of the missing Frenchman,
< hazzell. who persist in claiming the body
as his, did not resort to injunction pro
ceedings, as threatened, but they talk of
invoking the aid of the French Consul and
sending to France for more evidence in
support of their contention. The reason
for their activity is that $2000 is lying in a
Salt Lake bank for proof of Cbazzell's
death, and since Chazzell's disappearance
a relative died in Lyons. France, leaving
him a lar^e fortune, which Chazzell's heirs
cannot claim, because they cannot legally
prove his death.
COAL RATE* IS COJL.OB.AIiO.
Sew Phase in thÂ« War i Between Rival
Railroad*.
DENVER, Colo., April 2.â The war be
tween the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf
and the Atchison 'and Rio Grande rail
roads over coal rates , presents a new phase
to-day. In order to < compel its competi
tors to enter an agreement upon a differ
ential coal freight rate the receiver of the
Gulf inaugurated a passenger rate war
which severely damaged the Rio Grande
Company, controlling the bulk of the local
passenger traffic between important towns
of Colorado. The Rio Grande to-day ap
plied to Judge Hallettof the United States
District Court for a restraining order to
compel Receiver Trumbvill to comply with
a contract relating to the joint track be
tween Pueblo and Walsenburg, and there
by cause the restoration of passenger
rates.
COAL CONTRACTORS INDICTED.
County Commissioners Mixed Up in a
Most Unpleasant Scandal at
Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., April 2.â The County
Commissioners in a lump, high county
officials who have to do with the letting of
contracts and known members of the coal
firm of Kennehck & Co., were investigated
by the Grand Jury to-day with the result
of indictments against the coal con
tractors.
The principal witnesses against them
were the drivers of the coal wagons, who
told the jury of the short-weight scheme
by whicn it is estimated the shortage
amounted to 400 tons a month. Subpenas
were issued for the whole couniy board to
appear before the jury, but not one could
be found in the county building or else
where, except three at the county hospital.
The action of certain commissioners in
regard to the letting of the coal contract
and to the charges made recently by
Judge Payne against Commissioner Mc-
Nichols are to be probed to the bottom.
Judge Payne appeared before the jury yes
terday and it was said submitted evidence
to show that McNichols had agreed to put
a man on the Grand Jury friendly to a
murderer, for $1500.
Bloodhounds on the Trail.
LEBANON, Mo., April 2.âSuperintend
ent Simpson of Wells, Fargo <fc Co. ar
rived here this morning and assumed
charge of the search for the men who
robbed the express-car on tbe St. Louis
and San Francisco road yesterday morn
ing. He states positively that the total
amount secured by the robbers was $1252,
and of this sum nearly $400 has been re
covered from packages dropped by the
men in their flight. Two packs of blood
hounds have been ordered placed on the
trail, but it is doubted if they will be of
much avail. The belief is growing that
the robbers were men living near the scene
of the hold-up.
VERY SMOOTH SWINDLERS
Operations of the Forgers Who
Duped August Belmont
& Co.
With the Use of Chemicals They
Have Often Raised Checks for
Large Sums.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 2.â Augnst
Belmont & Co. declined yesterday to make
any statement regarding the false draft
from Havana by a man calling himself
Manuel Gonzales Memlozea, on which
they paid $24,000. So far as is known abso
lutely no trace of the swindler or swindlers
has been obtained by any of the detectives
engaged in looking for them.
A man from Cuba who is familiar with
the methods of the gang of Havana bank
swindlers, of which it is believed Men
dozea is a member, said that these swind
lers generally secured a genuine draft for
a small amount, and with the aid of chem- I
icals erased the original figures and raised
tbe draft. This was what they did in the
case of Fernandez Castro, and which net
ted the swindlers $18,000.
Another case in which they did this, and
which has not been printed, is that of
Banker Boniface Pinion. The banker has
an account with the Spanish Bank of the
island of Cuba. In tLe regular course of
business he cave a check for a small
amount. When the check reached the
bank it called for $40,000. The signature
was all right, and the money was paid.
Pinion sued the bank, and the bank had to
stand the loss.
In another case a check was presented to
the Spanish Bank signed by one of the
members of the board of governors of the
bank and calling for a large amount. The
cashier, to whom it was presented, sus
pected something waa wrong and asked
the man to wait a few minutes until the
money could be got from the vaults. Then
he went to call in the police, but the man
decamped. The original amount in this
check had been erased and figures for ten
or twenty times the amount put in.
In still another case the Spanish Bank
paid a draft drawn by a Spanish army
officer. It was for a large amount and the
funds belonged to the Government. The
swindler who presented the draft wore the
uniform of a Spanish officer, and got away
with the cash.

General Lugo laaue* a Circular on Xica
riiqua'n Rebellion.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 2.â General
Lugo, Secretary of Foreign ReJations of
Nicaragua, has issued a circular to his
Government's consuls in the United States
respecting the recent rebellion in Nica
ragua.
After referring to the previous good or
der and prosperity existing the circular
says: "A military rebellion broke out in
the city of Leon, led by the military
authorities of that place, and a few hours
afterward a considerable force of men,
armed with firearms and artillery, at
tacked the cruiser Angela, stationed at the
port of Momotombo, which was preparing
to make its customary run to this city,
carrying a small detachment of twenty-five
soldiers of the Government forces. The
rebels fired upon the vessel, which, owing
to the sagacity and valor of the troops de
fending it, was enabled to get away from
the rebels, reaching this city with one
dead and several wounded, after having
left behind the dead and wounded of the
attacking party."
In conclusion the assertion is made that
the great mass of the people were opposed
to the outbreak.
MANITOBA SCHOOL QUESTION.
Clote of the Conference Without Reaching
an Agreement.
WINNIPEG, Manitoba, April 2.â The
school conference closed this afternoon
and has been barren of result. The Do
minion delegates wanted the Provincial
Ministers to re-establish separate schools,
but in a modified form, as exists in Nova
Bcotia. The Manitoba representatives
replied declining this, but offered to elim
inate religion entirely from the schools or
to set apart hours during the day for re
ligious teaching, either Protestant or
Catholic. The Ottawa delegates would
not agree to this and the conference ad
journed. The Ottawa Commissioners left
for home to-day.

deal of steel will be used in the yacht, and
she will resemble ihe Valkyrie, except
that her keel is shorter.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 1896.
POLICY OF THE
HOUSE REVERSED
An Appropriation Is Voted
for a Sectarian
School.
REOPENS THE QUESTION.
Howard University Benefits by
the Change of Sentiment
of Members.
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH.
Democrats Charged With Neglecting
the Negroes and Robbing Them
of Their Rights.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 2.-For
three hours and a half to-day the House
indulged in a repetition of the religious
discussion which raged when the District
of Columbia appropriation bill was under
consideration, and as a result the policy of
the House, as expressed at that time by a
decided refusal to appropriate money lor
tlie charitable and benevolent institutions
of the District, was in effect reversed. The
inciting cause of the debate was the amend
ment to the sundry civil bill, which was
adopted in committee of the whole yester
day on motion by Evans (R.) of Kentucky,
giving Howard University in Washington
$32,600, the appropriation having been
omitted from the bill by the committee re
porting it. The amendment was advo
cated by Bartlett (D.) of New York, Sayers
(D.) of Texas, Cannon (R.) of Illinois and
Evans (R.) of Kentucky. It was opposed
by Hainer (R.) of Nebrasba. McÃae (D.)
of Arkansas, Johnson (R.) of California,
Andrews (R.) and Livingston (D.) of
Georgia.
There was a digression from the main
question, when Hepburn (R.) of lowa, re
sponding to the remarks by Saver?,
charged the Democrats of the South with
not only failing to provide equal educa
tional advantages to the negroes with the
whites, but robbing them of their civil
rights.
His statements were vigorously combat
ed by Sayers and others.
When the matter got into the House an
aye and noe vote was taken on the amend
ment, and it was agreed toâ ayes 129, noes
105. This debate practically closed con
sideration of the sundry civil appropria
tion bill, and no further amendment was
made. It was passed as reported from the
committee of the whole.
Hitt(R.)of Illinois reported favorably
from the Committee on Foreign Affairs
the resolution asking the President to
transmit to Congress all the correspond
ence in ihe Department of State relating
to mediation or intervention by the United
States in the affairs of Venezuela since
Decenioer 1, 1895 to date, and the resolu
tion was agreed to.
The House, having resumed considera
tion of tbe sundry civil appropriation bill,
Hainer (R.) of Nebraska opposed the ap
propriation of $32,500 for the support of
Howard University.
He asked members what excuse th<Â»y
could make to their constituents for vot
ing an appropriation for giving higher
education to the colored girls and boys
which they denied to those of their own
race and their own children. Howard
University received as much money from
other sources as it did from the United
State.". One of its chief contributors was
the American Missionary Society cf the
Congregational Church. He had opposed
appropriations in another bill, which
would have gone to Catholic institutions,
and he asked how the House could refuse
to vote money to a Catholic institution
and then vote an appropriation to an in
stitution controlled by the Congregational
Church. The only safe principle was to
absolutely dissolve church and State.
Hainer, as a conclusion of his remarks,
sent to the clerk's desk and had read Gen
eral Grant's remarks at the reunion of the
Society of the Army of the Tennessee in
1870, in which the general said that no
money intended for educational purposes
should ever be voted to sectarian control.
Bartlett (D.) of New York replied to
Hainer'? speech. Bartlett charged that
Hainer himself was the author of bills to
devote public money to private purposes
or persons. Bartlett proceeded to read
the titles of several bills introduced by
Hainer. He denied that the negroes in
South are unjustly treated, and explained
that in Texas for every dollar appro
priated for the education of a white child
another dollar is set aside for the educa
tion of the colored child.
Hepburn of lowa said that in Texas and
in other Slates the negroes are refused ad
mission to tbe universities and agricultu
ral colleges, that right being reserved for
the whites. He asserted that the negroes
of the South were robbed of their civil
rights and refused the righs of suffrage,
and that the whites in that region used
the stolen right it has given them in the
House of Representatives to vote appro
priations for their benefit.
The amendment was opposed by John
son (R.)of California and McÃae (D.) of
Arkansas.
Livingston (D.) of Georgia presented a
petition, signed, he said, by every colored
pastor, presiding elder and Bishop of the
District of Columbia, asking Congress to
investigate the expenditure of funds of
Howard University and making serious
charges against the management.
Andrews (R.) of Nebraska opposed the
amendment, because he could not in good
conscience vote public money for a secta
rian or private institution. The Govern
ment had no control over Howard Univer
sity, he said, and therefore, however
much he mieht favor the objects of the in
stitution, he found no ground upon which
to support the amendment.
Closing the debate for the amendment,
Evans (R.) of Kentucky said that it had
been hurriedly drawn, and was nol in
terms as he would prefer, and he gave no
tice that if the House would permit he
would ask that it be amended so as to pro
vide for supervision of the institution by
the Secretary of the Interior and io
strengthen the prohibition against the use
of money for any sectarian or religious
institutions.
The debate, which had from time to
time been extended by unanimous
consent, and which had occupied three and
a half hours, was closed by Hainer in a re
view of the reasons marshaled by him in
the beginning against the amendment.
On motion by Cannon in lieu of the
amendment proposed yesterday by Hyde
(R.) of Washington an item was inserted
into the bill appropriating $40,000 for the
new post at Spokane, Wash., and $50,000
for the post at Fort Riley, Kans.
The committee then rose and reported
the bill and amendments to the House
with a favorable recommendation.
Evans (R.) of Kentucky proposed the
substitute for his proviso to his Howard
University amendment of which he gave
notice in committee of the whole, and it
was agreed to.
On the amendment itself the vote was
taken by ayes and noes, resulting ayes 129,
hops 105.
The bill was then passed, and at 5:25
o'clock, on motion by Cannon (R.) of Illi
nois, the House adjourned until to-mor
row.

CASE OF GREER COUNTY.
Decision of the Supreme Court
Will Cause Action by
Congress.
Affairs Relating to Judicial Matters
and Land Titles Left in
a Tangle.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.â The
text of the decree of the Supreme Court of
the United States in the famous Greer
County case, which was not included in
the announcement of the judgment made
by Justice Ilarlan a fortnight ago, baa
been made public. It reads as follows:
'â¢The territory east of the one hundredth
meridian of longitude west and south of
the river now known as the Xorth Fork of
the Red River and north of a line follow
ing westward, as prescribed by the treaty
of 1819 between the United States and
Spain, the course and along the south
bank both of Red River and of tde river
now known as the Prairie Dog Town Fork
or soutti fork of Red River on such line
meets the one hundredth meridian of
longitude, which territory is sometimes
called Greer County, constitutes no part
of the territory properly included within
or rightfully belonging to Texas at the
time of the admission of that State into
the Union and is not within the limits nor
under the jurisdiction of that State, but is
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States of America."
The decision of the court left the affairs
of Greer County, now a part of Oklahoma
Territory, especially those relating to ju
dicial matters and titles to land, in a con
dition which only legislation by Congress
could remedy. To meet the requirements
Representative Cockrell (D.) of Texas has
introduced two bills. One is intended to
validate the judgments of the District
courts in Greer County heretofore ren
dered, and provides, further, that all cases
now pending in the courts of said county
shall be prosecuted to a final decision by
the courts of Oklahoma under the laws of
Texas. The other bill establishes regula
tions lor settlin 'public land questions. It
provides that actual settlers of March 10,
1896, shall have a preference right
within twelve months from the passage of
the act to perfect homestead rights to 160
acres, and also to purchase 160 acres more
at $1 25 per acre. Six hundred and forty
acres are reserved withia the limits of
Mangum, Kavajo and Altus for townsites;
two acres each are reserved for every
schoolhouse building or church erected at
the date the act takes effect, and a land
office is established at Mangum.
ARRANGEMENT OF THE STARS.
Bill to Regulate tint â  Ute of a Uniform
flag. '.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.-In the
Senate to-day Sherman introduced a bill
to regulate the use of a uniform flag in the
army and navy, its proportions and the
location of the stars in the blue field. .The
flag proposed :is to be used on and after
July 4, 1900. The arrangement of the stars
is as follows: Three in each corner and a
central star, around which shall be en
twined a sufficient number of stars so that
the total number in the blue field will rep
resent tne total number of States. The bill
seta out that the twelve stars in the four
corners and the one in the center represent
the thirteen original < States, according to
their geographical location on the map,
assuming the top of the field to be north,
. and the other States are represented in the
circle of stars in the order in which : they
were admitted ; to the Union, placing the
oldest star nearest â  the center. . The idea
.carried out in ibis bill is that of Alonzo
Mather of Chicago. '
For the Indian Schools.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.â The
Senate Committee ou Appropriations re
ported the Indian bill this afternoon. The
chief contention in the committee has been
over the Indian school appropriation. The
House went on the theory that there
should be no appropriation for sectarian
schools, and yet appropriated $33,000 for
Lincoln School and $20,000 for the school
at Hampton, Va., both of which, it was
claimed, are sectarian. Both of these ap
propriations the Senate Committee has
struck out. The general appropriation for
schools for the Indians not sectarian has
been increased by upward of $300,000.
Account* 'Well Kept.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.â United
States Treasurer Morgan and party have
returned from New Orleans, wbere an
examination of the sub-treasury in that
city was made. Morgan reports accounts
accurate and well kept.
GREAT BRITAIN
TO BACK DOWN
May Soon Abandon Claims
to Disputed Territory
in Venezuela.
MINING WORK CHECKED
English Syndicates Not Ready to
Expend Money While There
Is a Controversy.
MAY LOSE THEIR PROPERTY.
Half the Task of the Boundary Com.
mission Has Already Been
Accomplished.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aprii 2.â British
Guiana papers dated as Jate as March 18,
whicn reached the Bureau of American
Republics yesterday, indicate the aban
donment of Great Britain's determination
to insist upon retaining all the settlements
established by Englishmen throughout
tne disputed territory should the Vene
zuelan claims be sustained. In regard to
these settlements Lord Salisbury wrote
Secretary Olney four months ago that
under no circumstances could they ever
be surrendered to alien jurisdiction.
The Georgetown Chronicle, however, in
its issue of March 18, says: The public
generally and those interested in mining
concerns particularly have learned with
regret that work has been closea down
,on the properties of the Winter
syndicate, the Bartley syndicate and
the Barima Development Company.
It is alleged that the reason the
proprietors have decided to adopt this
course is because tney do not consider
thut in the unsettled state of the bound
ary question their rights are at present
sufficiently secure to justify them in in
curring the heavy expenditure which con
tinued prosecution of the work would
require.
In another part of the paper a statement
from Mr. Connolly, superintendent of the
Barima Company, is published, declaring
that he had received instructions from
London not to incur any additional heavy
expenses until the Government gave
xrants to the property, the company's
solicitors thinking it would be injudicious
in the present position of the Venezuelan
boundary dispute to spend money devel
oping property which mig.it be taken
from them without compensation.
Other superintendents have received
similar instructions from London head
quarters.
The location of these companies is in
the richest gold field that has yet been
found in Guiana, and the capital already
invested there is greater than in any other
locality in the colony.
SESSION OF THE COMMISSION.
Work Thai Baa litien Done During the
I'ast Three Months.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.â Justice
Brewer presided to-day over the first for
mal meeting of the Venezuelan Commis
sion held for the past two weeks. All the
members were in attendance. After a
careful individual study of the British
blue book they entered into a discussion
of its arguments and evidence. To-day's
session is considered the most important
so far held by the commission, which is
now possessed of all the main features of
the contention and the principal points
upon which the dispute depends.
The question of sending one or more
representatives of the commission to Eu
rope to verify the accuracy of the docu
ments submitted by Venezuela and Great
Britain was discussed, and while no defi
nite action was taken the indispensability
of the examinations of Spanish as well as
Dutch archives was recognized, and no
doubt is expressed that a search will soon
be ordered. The commission has now
been at work three months, and its labors
are thought to be about half completed.

1 All Member* of ex- President Harrison's
/ : i Cabinet Will Be at the Wedding.
â  NEW YORK, N. V., April 2.â General
Benjamin F. Tracey, ex-Secretary ;of the
Navy, called to see ex- President ; Harrison
to-day at the Fifth-avenue Hotel. -â¢ He will
be the ex-President's best man and his
visit was purely social.
It is possible that nearly all the members
of the ex-President's Cabinet may be pres
ent at the wedding. Private Secretary E.
F. TibbettÃ said that John Wanamaker
was expected to arrive from Europe before
Sunday. Ex-Governor Cnarles Foster of
Ohio has not been heard from yet, but is
expected. General John W. Noble of St.
Louis will be unable to come owing to
business engagements.
The only visitor who saw the ex-Presi
dent was General Tracey. After a late
breakfast the ex- President paid Mrs. Diin
mick a visit. All the stories telegraphed
from Indianapolis to the effect that Mrs.
McKee, daughter of General Harrison, will
not be able to attend the wedding, owing
to the fact that she bad been exposed to
the measles, were deemed of not sufficient
importance to answer. Russell Harrison
ana wife are expected to arrive before Sun
day.

JACKSONVILLE, FtA., April 2.â J. V.
Gilbert, aged 75 years, died at bis home in

DEFEAT OF THE BILL.
An Attempt to legalize the Manufacture
of Liquor in lowa.
DES MOINES, lowa, April 2. -In the
Senate this afternoon the bill to legalize
the manufacture of liquor in lowa was de
feated, 22 to 27, with one member absent,
who sent word that he desired the record
to show that had he been present he woula
have voted against the bill. All the seven
Democrats voted for the bill, filing ex
planations which in substance said they
regarded the measure as a very short step,
but in the right direction. They first pro-
Dosed a substitute bill, a far more liberal
measure, which was defeated by a strict
party vote.
The result was exactly as expected. The
biil had been under discussion for two
days before the vote was reached. The
members from the river counties aiid large
cities made a desperate fight for the bill,
but it was of no avail.
SHOT BOWS JiÂ¥ DESPERADOES.
Officers Fired Z'pon at the Houae of Tay
lor Delk.
CONCORD, Ga., April 2.â Sheriff Guinn
and a posse to-night went to the house of
Taylor Delk, a notorious desperado, to ar
rest him for robbery and assault. As tne
Sheriff arrived at the door he was shot
through the left side. While Guinn was
lying on the front porch begging for some
one to come and get him, John F. Madden
attempted to drag him off and was fired
on, the ball passing through both thighs,
breaking both legs.
The house scon was surrounded by an
armed mob and threats of burning the
building were made. At 10:30 o'clock
Delk, his son and an escaped convict and
a partner of Delk's named Tom Langford,
who were the occupants of the house, ran
out the back door, shooting |and cursing.
The rosse fired, but failed to bring down
any of them. A posse with dogs is in
pursuit.
ON THE NICARAGUA CANAL
Linden W. Bates Talks Before
the House Commerce
Committee.
Says the Completion of the Big Ditch
Would Prove the Salvation of
the Pacific Coast.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 2.-The
hearings on the Nicaragua canal were con
tinued to-day by the House Commerce
Committee, Linden W. Bates of Chicago
being the speaker. He was familiar with
the reports of the canal company for the
past seven or eight years and had had
frequent conferences with the officers of
the company and those who did the sur
veying. He was now connected with the
Chicago Drainage Canal. He compared
the dredges used on the drainage canal
with those used on the Panama canal.
The former could do the work of 60,000
men witn shovels and wheelbarrows and
had a power greater than all the machinery
and men used on the Panama canal.
Speaking from the standpoint of a
propeny-owner on the Pacific Coast, he
said he thought the Nicaragua canal would
prove the salvation of that secti on.
In reply to a question, he said that
nearly all the prominent contractors on
the Chicago drainage canal were familiar
with the Nicaragua canal. In his opinion
most of them would like to take part in
the construction of the Nicaragua canal.
They had some $3,000,000 invested in
plants at Chicago, and parts of these
plants could be profitably used in Nic
aragua. As an expert, he saw no reason
why contractors here would not undertake
the work and successfully complete it.

TRAGIC DEATH
OF A LUNATIC
Jumps From a Car- Window
While a Train Is at
Full Speed.
FOUND BY A SICK WIFE.
Flees Across the Country and Is
Pursued by a Crowd for
Five Hours.
THEN HE BIDES STOLEN HOESES
Finally the Unfortunate Man Is Shot
and Expires From His
Injuries.
BELLIOTT, 111., April 2.â John Frank
lin of Fort Recovery, Ohio, an insane man,
met a tragic death near here to-day. He
and his wife were on their way from Ohio
to St. Louis on a Lake Erie train, and
when they reached Blooniington last
night Mrs. Franklin was taken sicfc, and
they determined to return to Fort Re
covery.
At 2 Vdock this morning Franklin
leaped from the eastbound Lake Erie
train near Holder while the train was at
full speed. The train wa3 stopped and
held for two hours while a vain Bearch was
made for the man.
Mrs. Frankiin left the train at Holder
and found her husband. They resumed
their eastward journey to-day, and at 10
A. m,, while the train was pulling out of
this place, Franklin fell from the steps of
a car, striking his bead on a railway tie.
He jumped to his ieet and declared that a
mob was pursuing him wanting to kill
him.
He then fled across the country pursued
by a crowd for five hours. During this
time he "stood off" his pursuers by firing
at them with a revolver. He entered a
iarmer's stable, took a horse and tied on
its back. A few miies farther on
he changed this horse for another.
He was finally stopped by a barb
wire fence, and some one *v the pur
suing party shot him with a shotzun
loaded with slugs, wounding him in the
&nee and face. His leg was amputated,
and at 6 o'clock he died. The affair caused
i great excitement.
COUNTERFEITER ARRESTED.
Has Been Grinding Out Excellent Green
Good* for Many Year*.
NEW I'ORK, N. V., April 2.â The
United States Secret Service agents to-day
captured a man named Emanuel Ninger,
who, they claim, has made counter
feits of United States bills of the
large denominations so excellent in
execution as to almost defy detention ex
cept by an expert. Ninger's house is in
Flagtown. N. J., and it is said that he
ade $10, $20 and $50 bills as far back as
1879. His latest series, however, consists
of $100 bills.
The arrest last Saturday evening of a
man named Joseph Gilbert, who at
tempted to pass a $50 pen and ink bill, fur
nished the ciew which led to Ninger'a
arrest.
This afternoon Ninger was arraigned
before United States Commissioner
Shields, who held him for exami
nation on April 11 under $20,000
bail. Later Agent Bopg said that
the prisoner had made a confession and
had surrendered the pens, inks and papers,
which he employed in making what the
officer says are probably the most danger
ous counterfeits of United States notes in
existence.

A DEMAGOGUE.
That Is How Smith Closes
His Argument Against
Silver.
OPPOSES FREE COINAGE
Would Cause the Most Terrible
Financial Panic the World
Has Ever Known.
KEFTJTED BY THE EX-SPEAKER
Remarks of the Interior Secretary
Two Years Ago Cited With
Telling Effect.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 2.â Ex-Speaker
Crisp and Secretary Hoke Smith held the
second of their series of joint debates here
to-night. The shaking |occurred at the
Moody Tabernacle before an audience of
'6000. Captain W. D. Ellis, chairman of
the county Democratic executive commit
tee, presided and briefly presented the
Bpeakers of the night.
Secretary Smith had the opening argu
ment. He was greeted with gtirring
applause. In opening his speech Smith
paid that every one had a direct interest in
the financial question.
Tben he went on to say that he was
orposed to free coinage at the present
ratio because it would produce silver
monometallism and lead to the ruost ter
rible financial panic the world Las ever
known. Explaining the great production
of silver in recent years, Mr. Smith stated
that it was due to the decrease in the cost
of nvininjr the metal by 50 per cent.
"1 invite the debate on the proposition,"
he said, "that we cannot make 371 1 * grains
of silver e>}ual in value to 23 22-100 grains
of gold. There is the questidn."
In closing, the speaker pictured a ruin
ous panic in the event cf the assumption
of free, unlimited and independent coin
aee by this country, and declared that its
effect on labor would be to cut wages in
I half.
The applause for Mr. Crisp when he
arose was prolonged. He said that silver
was demonetized because it was worth
more than gold. It was not cheap money
then. There was too much money In the
world then for those who loaned money.
They- wanted to cut down the amount of
standard money and leaving only half,
and that gold, and they owned the gold.
The ex-Speaker then quoted from a
, Epeech which Smith made in 1594 declar
r ing that he believed a single gold standard
to be unwise and dangerous and calculated
to contract the currency, check industry
and turn honest men out of places. He
made great sport cf these declarations
ami put a number of questions to the
Becreiar;- tÂ« j'.;.MÂ»er.
Smith had twenty minutes to close the
debate, in the course of which he claimed
that his arguments had not been an
swered, and in conclusion called ex-
Speaker Cri<p a demagogue.
lI.LIXOIS 31 E\ FOR CULLOM.
Mark Hanna Flatly Contradicted by
Aldrieh and Lorritner.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 2.âRefer
ring to Mark Hanna's charge that his
statement as to the preference of Illinois
Relegates to the Republican National Con
vention was untrue. Representative Al
drieh this evening said:
"Oh, this is too absurd. I had given Mr.
Hanna credit for more political sagacity
than he really seems to possess, if the
interview is authentic, which hardly seems
possible, ana 1 am sure he will make haste
to correct it in any event. Ask any one
from Illinois and New Hampshire â any
one who is qualified to epeaKâ and you
will rind that Mr. Hanna is wrong and
that my claims are correct."
Congrfssman Lorriruer, who was stand
ing by, said: V
"1 do not claim to know anything about
the.condition in New Hampshire, but I do
know something of the situation in Il
linois. I happen to be one of the dele
pates to St. Louis, and know that I
am for Cnllom. We have also elected
nine other gentlemen in Chicago as dele
gates to St. Louis who are also for Cnllom.
f know that the delegates elected from the
Twentieth, Congressman Burrell's district,
and the delegates elected from the Nine
teenth district, represented in Congress
by Mr. Wood, are for Cullom for Presi
dent. If Mr. Hanna makes the statement
that McKiniey has more than four out of
the eighteen and Cullom less than four
teen of the eighteen already elected, he is
talking about matters with which he is not
familiar. The claim made by the McKin
ley men that a large majority of the dele
gates from Illinois will not be for Cullom,
and that they will support McKiniey has
not been very considerably backed up by
the results already obtained, and when the
Illinois State Convention shall have ad
journed Mr. Cullom .will, without any
question, have the large majorky of dele
gates from Illinois, the previous statement
of the McKiniey men and Mr. Hanna to
the contrary notwithstanding."

in his Denver address shall repeat his
speech delivered in the Senate the effect

result in a contesting delegation.
IVES DEFEATS O Alt SI EX.
The Belgian So Match for the Xapoleon
oj liilltards.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 2.â The re
sult of the fourth game in the 18-inch
balk-line tournament was a foregone con
clusion in the minds of the patrons of the
game who had seen the meeting of Ives
and Gamier on Tuesday night. Accord
ingly, when Ives and the Belgian cham
pion crossed cues for the second time to
night there was a meager audience in the
concert hall of Madison-square Garden.
Ives ran out the game while Gamier was
making 103. Ives gathered in 39 in the
first inning, when he fell on a rather easy
draw. Garnier's rir?t attempt netted him
30, when a difficult two-cushion shot
caused his retirement. The champion's
contribution in the second and third in
nings was 54 and 46, while the Belgian
only compiled 14 and 5, and the card stood :
Ives 139, Gamier 49.
Ives gave a grand exhibition in the
fourth inning. With wonderful delicacy
he nursed the ivories along the lower rail
and piled up the points. He passed his
third wire and made 164, the second best
run of the tournament so far, before a kfes
robbed him. His average for four innings
was 75 3 i, or nearly half again as much as
Garnier's total score for seven innings. .
The game to-morrow will be between
Schafer and Gamier. Score: Ivesâ 39, 54,
46, 164, 2, 30, 140, 23. 9, 6, 6, 90â600. Gamierâ

lof her. He often swore at her, and on
j one occasion 'hurled a glass at he". He
neglected to furnish tier with clothing,
and after he went into insolvency she was
compelled to live in a single room for five
I months. The provisions ran out, but

anything like an accurate statement of
the losses, but the estimates place them as
follows: Plant system, $75,000; Downing
Company. $225,000; Briezenick and occu
pants, $60,000; Lott, $15,000. The Down
ing and Lott losses are covered by insur
ance.
Business was suspended and the entire
I population viewed the flames. When
j Hoyt's building caught it was expected
I that the entire business portion of Bruns
wick was poing and merchants began
moving their stocks to the outskirts of the
city.
Pandemonium reigned, drays and other
vehicles were driven at breakneck speed
up and down the streets to store doors and
flying clouds of sparks sent property-own
ers home to guard their buildings. Way
cross, Savannah and Jacksonville were
wired for assistance, but, the water supply
was exhausted before the neighboring fire
men arrived on special trains, rendering
their presence practically useless.
The lire interfered with the j;as and elec
tric-light works, and no lights are burning
to-night, while the dense smoke keeps the
town in total darkness.
The Brunswick Rifles have been called
out to do guard duly.
JVOX jtPJPHH.CIA.TJiO I A CHICAGO.
Therefore -Eleanor tm.tr Will JV'o* Go to
the l.iiUf City.
CHICAGO, 111.. April 2. âWhen Eleanor
Dose, the Italian actress, last appeared in
Chicago her reception was not cordial
from a financial standpoint and she since
has declined to return without a guarantee.
So it was planned that a subscription
ticket sale should be inaugurated.
Colonel L. L. Sharpe yesterday tele
graphed to Henry C. Miner and Joseph
Brooks, Duse's managers, advising them
ajrainst coming to Chicago. The reason
for the discouraging advice was that the
first two days' receipts of the subscription
sale netted only $. r )ou and it was thought
the outlook for the week was too dis
couraging for the maoagers, who are
under contract to pay the star a certain
amount for every performance whether it
be to crowded houses or empty seats.
Lack of familiarity witn Italian on the
part of Chicagoaua and the date of the
subscription sale, a whole month before
the opening of the engagement, is given
as the cause of the limited sate. The
actress has been drawing crowded houses
is New York and Boston and her mana
gers philosophically regard the failure of
the subscription plan as pnma facie evi
dence Chicago does not want Duse. It is
reported they will follow tiie advice of
Colonel Sharpe and call the entire project
off.

A SANTA BARBARA CROOK
Many Victims of a Smooth
Young Man With a Fine
Barytone Voice.
Was No Respecter of Persons â Even
Beat a Local Newspaper
Out oi $25.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal.. A"pril 2.â
When William Merry, insurance solicitor
and all-round glib man of business
by profession and an amateur bary
tone of unusual talent, suddenly
left town for Los Angeles several
daj's ago his friends and quondam em
ployer observed a wise discretion in allud
ing to his departure, but now that sufficient
time has elapsed to enable them to com
pare notes all are talking at once and with
remarkable candor.
Merry was a decidedly good-looking
young fellow of gentlemanly address, who
arrived here live months ago and engaged
as insurance solicitor with John Percy
Lawton. the latter' a young Englishman
of excellent standing in the community.
Merry bore no credentials, but referred in
an off-hand way to a leading insurance
firm of New York City and was accepted
on his own statements as a rushing young
business man. He has more than ful
filled this promise.
Discovering discrepancies in his accounts
amounting to some $40 J. Lawton last week
called upon Merry fora settlement. This
the latter readily undertook to partially
meet by giving Lawton a bill of sale of his
horse and valuable saddle and bridle, and
then coolly borrowed fare to Los Angeles,
where lie stated he had a brother who
would lend him funds sufficient to settle
the balance. This is the la^ttiiat has been
seen of him, but countless unexpected in
cidents connected wiih his career here are
constantly coming to light, and it would
seem that he has profited almost as well as
Mme. Lefebre in trading upon the good
will and confidence of the community.
The horse and saddle which he pledged
to Lawton he had already soid to an
other gentleman and liad pledged it as
security to a third for a loan of $100,
which he claimed had been collected by
Lawton toward the purchase -ot a miter
for Bishop Johnson, newly appointed to
this diocese of the Protestant Episcopal
church, but which for some inexplicable
reasonwas not immediately available to
ibe paid at the call of the committee
I havÂ»ng the collections in charge. He also
made a collection on his own account for
this same imaginary miter. He also
issued insurance policies of which he gave
no account to the office, retaining the
premiums for his own enjoyment. His
victims in these cases were largely ladies.
In one instance he succeeded in
swindling a livery-stable keeper out of
$100 upon an imaginary speculation in a
Summeiland oil lot; but perhaps bis
crowning feat was to actdal'y cheat a
local newspaper proprietor out of $25.
Merry's tine barytone voice made him a
welcome addition to local musical organ
izations as well as to the choir of Trinity l
Church, but he was not taken up socially,
his only appearance in the houses of Santa
Barbara's upper ten being ns a paid
singer. Among men he associated on an
equality with the young bloods of the
place. The date of his return is problem
atical, but a warm reception awaits him.

CHICO TO HAVE A FESTIVAL.
The People of Santa Cruz Are Busy
Perfecting Details and Money
Is Rolling In.
__
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 2.â The commit
tee on street decorations of the Carnival of
Roses have perfected the plans for three
of the great floral arches, and work will be
commenced on them in a week or ten
days. The design of another arch will he
decided in a day or two, and it is thought
two more arches will be erected by private
parties.
The arches will be the finest ever erected
upon the coast. They will be entirely
covered by flowers and arranged so as to
form the carnival colors â red, white and
blue. The base of the arches will be banked
by potted plants and flowers.
The committee has decided to erect
arches across Santa Clara street, at Third
street; on the Alameda just east of the
narrow-gauge track; across First street at
Bassett, and across First street at San
Antonio. The other two will probably be
erected in the middle of the block on
First, between Santa Clara and San Fer
nando, and on First, between Santa Clara
and St. John streets.
The arch at Third and Santa Clara
stroets will be an imposine structure after
the old California mission style of archi
tecture. It will be forty feet high, with
three arches, the central one twenty
seven feet high and twenty-foar feet wide,
and the side arches twenty-three feet high
and sixteen feet wide.
it will be surmounted by a tile roof. A
high staff in the center will support the
American flag and streamers of red,
white and bine will droop to the outer
points of the arch.
The arch on trie Alameda will be of
nearly the same design and size. The
street is a trifle wider there and this will
give additional width to the arches.
The other arches will be similar in de
sign, and covered entirely by flowers.
CBICO'S MAXJtAI fJESTITAIj.

grove. Several hundred dollars have been
subscribed by the leading citizens and
merchants of Chico, and a grand time is
exi.ected.

pected. Ballot-boxes will be placed in
each of tin: confectionery stores and the
price of votes is 5 cents, six for 25 cents,
twelve for 50 cents and twenty-live for $1.
A year ago, when arrangements lor the
Fourth of July celebration was in prog
ress, the projectors hit upon a plan to give
the people of Chico a chance to all have a
voice in the selection of tie Goddess of
Liberty ana at the same time materially
assist the celebration fund linancially.
Ballot-boxes were placed in several of
the prominent stores, and each person by
depositing a nickel or a s.um larger was
entitled to cast votes for the lady of his or
her choice to the number the money
called for. The ballots were counted twice
a week, and the result when ttie contest
had closed was astonishing. A large sum
was realized from the sale of votes, and
Miss Alice Sproul, the popular school
teacher, was declared the ciioice.
There will be a large number of Chico's
popular young ladies that wili enter the
contest and many a young man will drop
a nickel for his favorite.

Inder Peculiar Circumstances.
MADERA, Cal., April 2.â Joseph Mc-
Cullora, a miner, aged 52 years, arrived in
Madera yesterday from Fresno Flats with
the intention of visiting his home in Wis
consin. He called on the local agent of
the Santa Fe line and purchased his ticket
to Mojave, stating that it was his inten
tion to start for the East on the night
train, and after making inquiry as to the
time of departure of the train he left the
office of the ticket agent and returned to
the'notel where he had been stopping, and
after supper made the necessary arrange
ments for leaving. He started for the
-Southern Pacific depot, and stopped in at
the office of the tictet agent and had his
baggage checked at 10 o'clock and then
walked out.

that the mystery would be solved to-day,
but a diligent search made by all of the
constables and others failed to find him.
He was known to have in his possession
money amounting to about $150, and it is
feared by the friends of the old gentleman

Hitler Feeling Between Catholics and A.
J*. A.' a in an, Oregon Town,
WOODBURN, Or., April 2â Word was
brought here to-day that there is much
excitement and bitter feeling in Butteville
over the killing of Frank Kelly yesterday
by James Dozier. There was talk of a
lynching party being organized to punish
Dozier. Some feeling exists against Coro
ner Clough because he held a secret inquest
yesterday. It has also been learned from
pretty reliable authority that a warrant
will be issued to-morrow for the arrest of
Dozier on a charge of murder. Dozier was
at his work to-day plowing and did not feel
uneasy as to his safety.
At the funeral of Kelly Dozier was de
nounced as a cold-blooded murderer by
the speaker. The fueling on the part of
the Catholics against the A. P. A.'s in
Butteville is very bitter and many fear
that more blood will be shed before the
trouble is ended.

Arrested for Opening a Letter Addressed
to Another I'rrnon.
LOS ANGELES. Gal., April 2.â William
H. White, a well-known business man of
this city, wag arrested at noon to-day by
Deputy United States Marshal Covarru
bias, on the charge of opening a letter ad
dressed to R. A. Johnson.
Mr. White is manager of the branch
house of Baker & Hamilton, dealers in
agricultural implements, of San Francisco.
The indictment on which "he was arrested
was returned by the Federal Grand Jury
last January.
It states that on May 25, 189.5, a
letter was mailed at Riverside, signed by
H. Johnson and addressed to R. A. John
son at Los Angeles, and that on the 27th
the defendant. White, knowingly and
with the design to pry into the letter,
opened it.

missioner Vandyke soon after his arrest
and was released on $1000 bail. He will be
arraigned next Thursday at 10:30.
When asked about the case Mr. White
said : "Johnson used to be in my employ.
I do not remember having opened a letter
addressed to him. I may have done so by
accident, for mv mail is large. Business
men do not always look at the addresses
on the envelopes when they are very much
rushed."

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cau, April
2â This afternoon the Stanford gymna
sium was tilled to its fullest capacity,
the audience being drawn thither by the
announcement that Chauncey M. Popew
had consented to give a short lecture there.
Fully an hour before the time for the
speaker to appear had arrived the floor
was packed, windows filled and rafters
covered by those who had failed to iiud
seats elsewhere.
When the speaker appeared he was
greeted with prolonged cheers, which did
not cease until Dr. Jordan stepped for
ward to introduce him to his audience.
In substance Mr. Depew said:
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, boys
and co-eds: I have spoken at a great many
places in r.iy lifetime â out of doors, indoors
and from pulpits and platformsâ but this is
the first time I have ever addressed an audi
ence in a gymnasium. Notwithstanding that
I do not propose to deliver an athletic address.
You will not expect from me to-day a com
mencement oration nor anything which has
about it the Horatian flavor,
When I received the invitation of your presi
dent here our party had upon us a heavy pro
gramme in doing the material part of Califor
nia, and ire did not anticipate when leaving
home of coming in contact with lU schools,
colleges, universities or this particular life
which is represented here. However, who
could come to California and pretend to have
s-een California and not have seen Stanford
University? I come to you in the capacity of
an elder brother. I come to you from Yale.
AYe have behind us a record of 200 years and
we are proud of our productions and of the
long line of our alumni and associations and
our family tree. Wo come out here to .find you
in full vigor and prosperous youth. In the
United States it Is possible for liberality and
munificence such as characterized the founder
of this institution to do the work of a century
In a day. In this country we differ from the
older nations of the world from the fact that
with them education has been for centuries a
privilege, while with us it is both a necessity
and a duty. Two great universities have been
sufficient for the higher educational needs of
England for hundreds of years and eight or ten
have been found equal to the necessities of the
people upon the continent of Europe. But in
;he United States we have 300 universities.
We are criticized about them and told that
most of them are nothing but acadeiaie?. I
have visited and am familiar with most of
them and find they are like the Kentuckian's
whiskyâ all are good, but some are better thar.
others.
We find here in this country that it is abfo
lutely necessary to have these universities and
such institutions scattered ali over the land,
for the number of young inei.â and now, hap
pily, young womenâ who are determined to
secure a liberal education has become so great
that ali the older institutions put together will
not equal the demand. Duplicate, if you wil 1,
Harvard. Columbia, Princeton and Yale, and
reduplicate fifty times, and they are not equal
to the demands of the country. And so it is a
source of honest pride to America that all the
Btttel of the West have state universities.
All have felt the need of a great college in
which the youth of the State can be brought
Jnto contact with learning, making tnem good
citizens of the whole country and citizens
of the world. And it has ever been a satis
faction to us in the East that your State, with
Â»ts liberal ideas, and the one grand man who
appreciated American liberties, together have
given two great universities to this coast.
American liberty is a great principle. Ameri
can liberty means that that government is best
which governs least.
After the police and sanitary arrangements of
the country, state and town shall be taken care
of, then the individual shall be left to his own
resource.*, equipped as best he can by educa
tion from taxation of the people, after which
he mates his own career. The charter founded
in the Mayflower has been the fundamental
principles which has made the United BUtea
what it is to-day, and the man who founded
this university was an exponent of American
principles. He it was, coming from nothing,
created a great everything, and having created
it recognized the responsibility resting upon
preat success to use it wisely for the benefit
of the public of the State where he lived.
We hear a great deal in our day about self
made men. Is there anybody in this country
who amounts to much who is not in some sense
a self-made man? Hut the usual definition is
a man who has accumulated wealth and done
nothing else. His motto is, "I seen it and I
done it." But we ignore entirely the self-made
man who has equipped himself for the great
duties and responsibilities of life. Nine-tenths
of all the boys in our colleges are self-made
men when they come out. I remember a self
made man of the type who is always calling at
tention to the fact that he made himself, who
had a head as clear of hair as a billiard-ball. A '
remark was made to him by one ot the wittiest
men who ever lived, who said: "Well, while
you were making yourself why didn't you put
some hair on your head?"
But the nobiest type of self-made man in the
United States is the type represented by that
man whom we all recall with pride and admi
raiion,Â«ieneral (iarhel.l. He had that pride
which belongs to what is called American bra
vado aud is not bravado at allâ a toiler in the
harness, who lived in a log cabin and had
worked fifteen aun eighteen hours* day; all
the children In the family worked equally
hard. That is not bravado, it is American
pride, because from these quarters have come
most of the Presidents of the United States,
most of the great generals of the army, most
of the men of N-.iters and .statesmen. General
ftarfield worked to assist his mother on the
farm, at night reading by the firelight, going
out on the tow path that he mi^ht add a. little
to the family tin, at the same time preparing
himself for college and later, by teaching, to
work himself through college; becomes princi
pal of a college, learns to be a lawyer, and a
good one, too; goes to Congress, goes In the
anay as major-general and dies President of
the United States. This is a type of the self
made man.
Now, young gentlemen, I am not here for the
purpose of giving you a moral lessonâ you
ought to know that as well as Iâ but for the
purpose of giving kind advice, which is all too
cheap; but I will say as. a result of personal
experience and observation in the world that
there is one fault In every college, and it is al
ways an injury, and that is the belief that
genius can enable a man to do anything with
out work. I have known fellows who would
idle around all day long and work all night
long, with tne windows darkened and cracks
in doors puttied up. trying to produce the im
pression that learning was obtained through
the pores. Such men arc a nuisaece in every
institution, for there is nothing in this world
worth having unless it comes by wort, and
there is nothing so much promotes honest
thinking, good health, bonest living and
longevity and ro much occupies life properly, I
tli ink, as honest work.
Now. young gentlemen, I see you have a
gymnasium. I believe in athletics. When I
was a student at Yale we had no gymnasium;
athletics was at a discount, that man was sup
posed to be the most intellectual who was the
most dyspeptic, and that one most spiritual
who was nearest and closest to the yawning
grave. We cultivated a round back and round
shoulders to show how studious we were. At
tin: beginning of the Civil War when students
and schoolteachers eniisted they were far from
a stalwart and soldierly type. A story is told
of n young man who had been a teacher who
went into the navy. A Britisher, looking at
him, asked, "What is that on your back?" The
answer was, "Why, that is Bunker Hill." But
since then we have progressed gloriously in
athletics. We have discovered now that a
healthy mind has got to have a healthy oody and
the foul is broader and healthier and stands a
better chance of getting into paradise in a
healthy body. We have progressed go far now
that we challenge the old universities and ask
sportsmen to come over here with their yachts
and race with us. They found the course too
crowded and then they went back, and Dun
raven was "Done-racing." We asked Oxford
to come over here and enter into Tsports of
various kinds with us of Yale, and we had
seven of the legitimate exercises of the gym
nasts of the Olympian field, and we gave them
the second prize in one. Now we are going to
carry out the same principle by the Yale crew
going to 'he Henley regatta, so the American
blue can vie with the Oxford blue, and if we
don't get the Oxford blue to hang up here we
will keep going until we do, and then put it
up with the old stars ana stripes above it in
the old gymnasium.
America is learning more and more every
day that this country is big enough, that its
opportunities are grand enough, and that its
liberty is pure enough and its humanity is
rich enough not to be drowned carrying the
spirit of goodwill toward all the world. The
Amerioan is becoming self-contained and so
self-satisned that he can stand a good deal of
what he sees in other countries and hears
without being discouraged.
There is one thing I want to impress upon
you, and that is the need of oratory. 1 notice
that speaking is dying out; debating societies
disappearing from colleges; speaking and de
bating is being left to the district school. You
will notice away back, in the generations the
many orators, but within twenty-five years
you tind no new orators in the country. It is
not because oratorical power does not exist,
nor because the genius for it does not exist as
; much now as then, but because nothing suc
ceeds without effort and training and without
experience. Our college boys go out in tne
world, having lost the power by not having
the training.
Another caution I will give you is not ex
actly "to improve each shining hour," but to
improve the idle minutes. My experience is
that we waste more time than we utilize.
Loafing is an art and should have certain times
set apart. But loafing as steady occupation is
demoralizing to nerves, f>:&in. morals and di
gestion. Any man can get a liberal education
on top of the education he possesses by using
odd minutes and odd hours. Read good books.
When you get married you will tind that if
your wife is never ready for the theater it is
not her fault. She is doing something for her
personal appearance that you require. Do not
find fault, but use the time in reading and you
will find the delay is for your benefjt. Women
are not constituted for time, but eternity.
I did not know until coming up here to-day
that this is a coeducational institution. lam
glad to see it. It is only within this century
that it has been considered proper to educate
the girls beyond the three R'sâ reading, writ
ing, arithmetic. But we have discovered that
women can be educated without .spoiling
them. I recall an address I gave at Smith
College, and the young ladies were amusing
themselves before my arrival in debuting upon
the question whether a liberal education of a
man (its him for domestic life. As long as we
are destined to be as we are destined to be
from the competitive standpoint, a liberal edu
cation is demanded alike for boys and girls,
and I am glad to see the idea adopted in Cali
fornia.
Our party has been simply carried away off
our feet up into the blue ether, and I do not
know whether we will ever get down or not.
We are wild with delight. We have every
thing in our party got up for enjoying our
selves. We have information on every subject
on the face of the globe from some one of our
party except California, and on that Cali
fornians are now receiving points that they
have never heard before. There has been no
cloud upon our horizon, nor teardrop in our
water. I understand that water is a great
thing in this country, but we do not notice it.
There is a line which has been more impres
sive and suggestive to me than any short sen
tence in the English language, and that is that
superb couplet of Kingsley's:
Be good, my boys, and let who will be clever,
Do noble things, not dream them ail day lODg.
And so make life, death and that vast forever
One grand sweet song.
THE TEMFLETOX ELOrERS.
After Many Tribulations Kelson Rejoins
His Runaway Wife.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 2.â Hy Nelson, i
the husband of Minnie Nelson, who ran
away from Templeton with Charles Ponl
son, a painter and acrobat, is in all sorts
of trouble.
Nelson is a Swede, and not too well
conversant with the customs of this
country, and so does not know the ropes
as well as many people. He was hunger
ing for a glimpse of his I wile,
who had been locked up in jail pending
the arrival of a constable from Salinas City,
where a warrant had been issued" for her
arrest and that of I'oulson.
Nelson walked around the jail several
times, until the jailers began to think he |
had some scheme for getting a prisoner
out. Finally, he spied his wife at one of
the grated windows and hailed her.
He had just entered into conversation
with her when Jailer Benjamin hailed him
and told him he would put him behind the
bars if he attempted to talk with any of
the prisoners without obtaining a permit
from the Sheriff's office.
Nelson hied himself to the police station
and told his troubles to a police officer.
He was finally fitted out with a permit
and went to jail to see his wife.
While Nelson was closeted with his
recreant spouse in the '. jail, . Chief
of. Police Kingsbury received a tele
gram â¢ from Constable Till man of Salinas
City, informing him that the District
Attorney there had ordered the char
against Poulson and - Mrs. Nelson dis
missed and asking that they be released.
They were taken before Justice Parker
this afternoon and released from custody.
Mrs. Nelson returned to Templeton with
her husband.
SEATTLE BARBERS SHAMPOOED.
They Invested About $400 in an Auto
matic Car Coupler.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 2.â Seattle's
contribution to the list of victims of the
automatic car-coupler swindle unearthed
by the Government Patent Office at Wash
ington City consists of two barbers. Joseph
Berryault and John Taggart. These in
dividuals were fleeced to the tune of about
$400. The swindler gave his name as
Arthur Bond and claimed to have been at
one time a telegraph operator in the New
York i^tock Exchange. Berryault believes
Bond is residing at Hancock, N. V., and
there is no doubt but that he is the man
who, according to Washington dispatches,
nas swindled so many people throughout
the country.

CONVENTION OF
SUNDAY-SCHOOLS.
Important Topics Befof e the
Noted Gathering at
Sacramento.
IMPROVING THE WORK.
President Morton Tells of the
Vast Opportunities for
Doing Good.
UNION OF THE DENOMINATIONS
It Has Done a Great Deal to Bring
About a Closer Relationship
of Christians.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 2.â The ex
ercises of the Sunday-school Convention
were opened to-day in the Congregational
church with a service led by Ira D. San
key. The next order of business was the
appointment of the several committees,
but this was postponed with the exception
of the appointment of Annie Aitken of
Sacramento as chairman of the enrollment
committee, in order that the president
coaid have access to her report in making
up the committees.
H. Morton of San Jose, president of the
California State Sunday-school conven
tion, then read hie annual report. Mr.
Morton said :
"No doubt many opportunities for doing
good have been neglected. Too often
have we acted as the priest or Levite and
passed by on the other side when we should
have imitated the good Samaritan
and rendered the Dest service in
our power to those wno needed our
sympathy and assistance. Let us honestly
seek pardon for all our past failures and
implore grace for the future in order that
we may be thoroughly furnished unto all
good works.
"Our international Sunday - school
Association has very plainly stated
the great purpose of these ' conven
tions, viz.: organization, evangeliza
tion and education. The union of
the- different denominations in our
Sunday-school conventions has done more
to cultivate that spirit of onenessâ to
bring into closer relationship all those who
love the Lord Jesus Christ, of whatever
name, than perhaps any other agency.
''Why should there exist any jealousy?
'We be brethren' comes ringing down the
centuries. Let us rejoice in the fact. One
Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
father of all."
He then went on to exemplify by anec
dote the power of the unity of numbers, and
in the course of his remarks said there are
11,000,000 Sunday-school members, with
1,500.000 teachers, in the United States,
and claimed that but little proeress had
been made through th# State during the
past year in advancing the interests of the
Sunday-schools, and spoke at length of
the needs and the lack of interest which is
seemingly portrayed.
He advocated house-to-house visitation.
He also advocated an implicit trust and
belief in the Biole, and went on to say:
"It seems to me that one of the obstacles
to our advancement as an organization is
the lack of some better means of commu
nication between the members of our as
sociation in different sections of the State.
If we could only have an organ through
which we could express our thoughts on
the needs of the dour, stimulate the weak,
encourage the fainting, rejoice with the
strong, ask and answer questions, talk with
our friends once every month, instead of
once a year, I believe great good would
come to our Sunday-school work. May I
not ask that this matter be delegated to a
committee for consideration ?
"Besides the consideration of the subject
I have named at this session you will be
called upon to elect delegates to the inter
national convention which meets in Bos
ton June 23 to 26."
At the close of the president's address
the following committees were appointed:
Enrollmentâ Miss Annie Aitken, Miss
Jennie Miller, J. Leiter and Fred Hollis.
Committee on conferenceâ Pastor, Rev.
M. V. Hoskinson; superintendent, W. W.
Lewis; teacher, Grove F. Ekins; primary
teacher, Mrs. M. M. Harding.
The different conference committees ad
journed to various parts of the building,
and at 11:30 returned and made their re
ports, after which an adjournment was
taken until 1 :H0 in the afternoon.
During the afternoon session Dr.
Ketcham of tha California Sabbath Ob
servance Association delivered a short
address, in which he advocated that
Christians discourage the purchase of
Sunday papers and devote the amount
saved to missionary work, and a resolution
to that effect was introduced and passed.
During the evening session the church
was simply packed and it became neces
sary to hold an overflow meeting in the
Sixth-street M. E. Church. An able ad
dress was delivered by Rev. E. S. Chap
man on the subject, "How to Teach the
Word," and the meeting adjourned after
consecration serv cc.
CAXXERS AMI* FI&IIERMEX.
Srriout State of Affairs on the Columbia
Jilcer.
ASTORIA, Or., April 2.â Trouble now
seems inevitable between the cannery men
and fishermen of the Columbia River.
Two weeks ago the fishermen Held their
annual meeting and decided that the price
of the raw fish for the season should be 5
cents, with the ultimatum that if the
cannerymen refused to pay this they would
refuse to fish.
Yesterday the Columbia River Packers'
Association completed its organization,
and declared that their ultimatum was to
pay but 4 cents per pound. Both have de
clared themselves with a full knowledge of
surrounding circumstances and the issue
that it is 9ure to bring about.
SofusJensen, secretary of the Fisher
men's Union, this morning said he was not
surprised at the action of the cannerymen
but it would result in no fish being packed
this season unless they pay 5 cents, and
that probably after May 1 they will be
willing and will pay 6 cents per pound.
Early this morning 400 fishermen left
here with a snag-puller and went to Sand
Island and destroyed all the fish traps
owned or supposed to be owned by the
canners. Four pile-drivers found at work
were turned adrift and went out over the
bar. The owners of the traps, intimi
dated by numbers, stood by and saw their
property destroyed. The fishermen claim
that the traps were in the channel sur
| veyed by United States engineers, thereby
interfering with the legitimate place for
using their nets.
This is the first blow in the great strike
to follow, which promises to be the great
est in the history of the Columbia River.
Neither side was ever so strongly organ
ized as this year.
TISAIjIA. STABHISU CASE. '
A Japanese Woman Horribly Cut by a
Chinaman, Who Escaped.
VISALIA, Cal., April 2.â About 11
o'clock last night a Japanese woman,
known as Hannah, was horribly stabbed
by a Chinaman, who escaped after com
mitting the crime. City Marshal Gilliam
was aroused, and hurried to the scene of
the stabbing.
Dr. Mathewson arrived about the same
time, and the woman was found to be ter
ribly mangled. She was stabbed in the
abdomen till the intestines protruded.
She was also cut about the neck in four
places, the cuts ranging from three inches
in length to seven inches. The woman
had bled profusely.
The woman herself grave the alarm by
screaming and hurrying over to the house
of Ed McGowan near by. McGowan fol
lowed her back to her house on the porch
of which she fell down in a faint. He car
ried her into the house and ran for a
doctor.
When the woman recovered conscious
ness she said a Chinaman had attempted
to kill her. She described him, but did
not know his name. Marshal Gilliam
found the bloody knife wielded by the
Chinaman in the street near the corner of
the house, where he had dropped it in his
flight.
It is of Chinese workmanship and is
sharp, heavy and well made. It was
covered with blood and the blade is fully
six or seven inches long. The terrible cut 3
in the woman's body were sewed up by the
physician, but there is little hope for her
recovery.
District Attorney Howard and Court Re
porter Elliott went to the bedside of the
woman this morning to cet her statement,
but she could say little coherently on ac
count of the great pain she was suffering.
AH efforts to find the guilty Chinaman
are futile, for the Chinese will not tell on
each other. It is known that two or three
strange Chinese came over from Hanford
on last evening's train. These men will
be watched.
COFFIX'S TRIAL AT CARS OX.
Argument* on the Vcmurrer to the In
dictment Heard.
CARSON, New, April 2.â The arguments
on the demurrer to the Coffin indictment
were made in the United States court to
day. Coffin's attorneys held that the in
dictment did net state that at the time of
the paying of the money the defendant
had knowledge of the fact that Langevin
was to be a witness in the case.
The United States District Attorney held
that the indictment made all the allega
tions necessary to establish the fact that a
crime had been committed, that justice
had been hampered and that the defend
ant would not have paid the money or
sought to secure the absence of a witness
unless he had knowledge of the fact that
be was to Jbe a witness. He cited authori
ties to show that when sufficient facts wore
set forth allegations of the defendant's
knowledge were unnecessary. The fact
that he was engaged in the illegal act of
bribery was a sufficient assumption of
the knowledge, and the indictment in set
ting forth the facts reads as follows: "The
defendant paid $100 to one Joseph Lange
vin with the purpose and the intent and
the object of obstructing the due adminis
tration of justice, by paying said sum to
prevent the Raid important witness from j
appearing and testifying in the case of
James Heney, then in progress in the Dis
trict Court of the United States."
The court took the matter under advise
ment and adjourned until Monday.

NO PAY FOR TWO MONTHS
Warrants of Collector Welburn
Are Ignored by
Carlisle.
THE WINE-GAUGERS TO BLAME
Their Reports Were Incorrect and
Experts Are Trying to Straighten
Them.
The employes of the Internal Revenue
Department in this City have not received
their salaries for February and March be
cause the Secretary of the Treasury refused
to honor the warrants of Collector Wel
burn.
Asa result of this unpleasant condition
of affairs there is a surprising increase in
the number of money-brokers who are
nocking to the Federal building on
Washington and Sansome streets. They
are buying warrants at from 2 to 5 per
cent discount and consequently will reap
a golden harvest.
The cause of the breach between the
Treasury Department of the United States
Government and the office of the Revenue
Collector seems to grow. out of the delay of
Mr. Weiburn's clerks in sending on their
reports to Washington. It is known that
the reports of the sweet-wine gaugers are
at least five months behind. Many of
these subordinates are said to be incom
petent. They have delayed the reports of
others who are capable.
Anyway there is consternation all along
the line, while the knowing ones wink the
other eye and observe that Collector Wel
burn employs too many women in his
main office. Anyway the fact remains
that the salaries of employes for the last
two months have been withheld, and now
those who have been paying large com
missions to money-brokers are going to
register a large-sized "kick."
It will require an extra staff of clerks to
catch up with the work in the revenue
office. The rumor is current that dis
crepancies from 2 cents to $2000 have been
found in the reports of the sweet-wine
gaugers, and much of the work will have
to be gone all over again.
Collector Welburn is very much exer
cised over the mess. He realizes that he
has been greatly imposed upon by poli
ticians in making appointments. He is
inclined to believe that the majority of the
sweet-wine gauirers have a greater capa
city for drams than for fractions.
The fact is that all the more incompe
tent gangersâ and there are a few of them
in the seryiceâ are assigned to gauge the
sweet wine. Such an assignment, is equal
to a certificate of incompetency. Conse
quently, the staff of sweet-wine gaugers is
large and influentialâ influential enough
to have the salary of Collector Welburn
himself slopped for 'two months, and
probably lunger.
THE REPUBLICANS
CALL A PRIMARY.
Stringent Safeguards Insure
an Honest and Free
Election.
MACHINERY IN MOTION.
The County Committee Divides
Into Two District Com
mittees.
DIFFERENCES IN THE FIFTH.
Harmony in the Fourth and a Dispute
in the Fifth Over Committee
man Rule.
The Republican primaries for the selec
tion of delegates to the State Convention
will be held on the 15th inst., and they
will be held in such a manner and with
such careful safeguards that a full vote, an
honest count and a full and free expression
of the will of the Republican voters of the
City will be assured.
The Republican County Committee, to
which the selection of delegates was re
ferred, made this decision at a special
meeting last night in Scottish Hall on
Larkin street, opposite the City Hall.
There were really two meetings, as the
committee adjourned as a whole and re
solved itself into two committees, com
posed respectively of the members repre
senting the Fourth Congressional District
and the seven Assembly districts
of San Francisco lying within the Fifth
Congressional District. The State Cen
tral Committee having this year dele
gated the convention preparations to the
various Congressional committees, and
these committees having no jurisdiction
outside of their districts, the segregation
of the County Committee into bodies for
this particular purpose was necessary.
When the county committee was called
to order as a whole by Chairman Charles
W- Manwaring tho hall was rilled with in
terested Republicans, who had come to
watch the proceedings, but who were
doomed to hear little of what was said and
done. The rollcall by Secretary John
Jackson showed all of the eighteen com
mitteeihen present, and then the minutes
of the last meeting were approved as read.
At the last meeting a special committee
was appointed to prepare suitable resolu
tions on the death of J. E. Donovan, who
had represented the Thirtieth District, but
on the suggestion of John M. Chretien,
chairman of the committee, that the reso
lutions would be more suitably adopted at
a regular meeting, the report was laid
over.
The chairman stated that inasmuch as
the members bad received credentials pro
viding for their meeting as two bodies it
would be proper to adjourn the County
Committee and for the members repre
senting the Fourth and Fifth districts to
meet separately at convenient places in
tho hall to transact their business. In
accordance with the suggestion the com.
mittee adjourned, and the spectators
heard little of what transpired thereafter.
The succeeding conferences were not
made executive, but as the committees
withdrew into partial privacy the audience
heard little furtner. The seven members
from the Fifth District got together at one
side of the stage, in full view of the audi
ence, but their conversation could not be
heard by the audience, though most of the
spectators remained seated for an hour,
viewing the conference on the stage, which
was plainly an animated one.
The eleven members representing the
Fourtn District went into a room at one
side of the stage, and there quickly, har
moniously and unanimously adopted an
election call.
John H, Chretien was elected chairman
of the committee and P. J. Walsh secre
tary. The other members of the commit
tee are: Albert Houston, John L. Brown
ing, Charles Berliner, Charles H. Clear, R.
W. Heilman, James Gately, A. A. Louder
back, G. Bacigalupi and Thomas W. C.
Landler.
The call was read by Secretary Walsh
and after a brief discussion it was adopted
unanimously as read on motion of Charles
H. Clear, seconded by R. W. Heilman.
The call adopted is a lengthy one. Its
opening paragraphs lecite the issuance of
the call by the State Central Committee
for a State Convention to be
held in Sacramento May 5, and
for Congressional District conventions
to be held at the same time, the
apportionment adopted and the action of
the Congressional committee of the
Fourth District in delegating to the mem
bers of the County Committee in the
Fourth District power and discretion to
select delegates.
The following paragraphs taken from
the document present its salient features:
Resolved, That the Republican County Com
mittee of the City and County ol Pan Francisco,
embraced within the Fourth "Congressional
District, acting under and in pursuance of its
aforesaid authority, does hereby order and
call a primary election to bo held in the City
and County of San Francisco, that portion
thereof embraced within the Fourth Congres
sional District, on the 15th day of April, 1896,
for the purpose hereinafter specified, in ac

I of election may give permission to said per
sons presenting said cards of admission to en
ter the polling-places before the opening of the
polls, and to remain there until the canvass is
completed and all the returns are proper
ly signed and sealed up. In the event of
the failure on the part of the election
officers to admit such persons holding
cards of admission to the polling - places
such person may call upon the police officers
detailed for such duty at such polling place, and
such police officer mny use all lawful means
to take such person inside the polling place.
The CHief of Police is requested to give in
structions to his officers to enforce this resolu
tion. Persons holding cards of admission may
be relieved by a duly appointed and author
ized alternate, who shall have the same rights
and privileges as the first regular representa
tive upon presentation of the card of admis
sion issued to the said original representative.
Resolved, That no barricade or other ob
struction shall be erected or maintained in
front of any polling place, but that the said
polling places shall be free from all obstruc
tions, as they are at general elections, and we
hereby give notice that no returns will be re
ceived or counted as official from any polling
place where this provision has been violated.
Resolved, That the official bellot-box ai|each
polling-pluce must remain in plain, un.
obstructed view from the opening to the close
of the polls, and.be so placed that the voter
may easily see the top of the box and his bal
lot deposited. The representatives of all tick
ets must be permitted to remain inside the
polling-places and in such position that they
can at all times witness, unobstructed, the re
ception of the ballot from the voter and the
depositing of the same in the ballot-box by the
inspector or judge of election who receives the
ballot.
Resolved, That no peddling of tickets or so
liciting of votes shall be allowed within 100
feet of the polls, and the committee requests
the police officers on duty to keep the polls free
and unobstructed at all times. This shall not
be construed to apply to the presence of chal
lengers.
Rfgolved, That in addition to all other
grounds of challenge in the laws of the State
governing general elections, this*committee
hereby directs and orders that the following
and additional test be given to voters : "I be
lieve in Republican principles, and indorse
the Republican policy, and intend to support
the nominee of the Republican party."
Resolved, That this committee hereby insists
that a free and untrammeled ballot and an
honest count must be carried out and rigidly
enforced at said primary election ; that all at
tempts to deviate from this principle should
be discountenanced and that those guilty of
frauds or parties thereto should be disbarred
from said nnd all other conventions, and
that if it shall appear at any poll
ing-place that there is or has been
any fraud or wrong committed, or the rights of
any citizen to cast his free and untrammeled
bnllot and to have the same honestly counted ,
has been in any way interfered with, this com
mittee will set aside and declare null and void
the election at said polling-place, and shall
proceed to provide the representation to which
said district is entitled in said convention as
above set forth.
Other paragraphs in the' call provide
that the committee shall furnish ballot
boxes and precinct registers: that ballots
shall be 6x12 inches in size; that the call
shall be published for five days; that re
turns shall be canvassed by the committee
and that none may vote whose names are
not in the precinct registers used at the
general election in November, 1894.
It also apportions the sixty-six delegates
to which the Fourth District i=v entitled as
follows: Twenty - eighth District, 5;
Twenty-ninth, 5; Thirtieth, 6; Thirty
first, 5; Thirty-second, 4; Thirty-third,
H; Thirty-nihth, 9; Forty-second, 7; Forty
third, 7; Forty-fourth, 6; Forty-fifth, 5.
The appointment of election officers was
disposed of in a resolution providing that
each county comniitteeman shall nomi
nate officers of election for his district, the
names to be sent to Secretary Walsh
at 850 Market street before next Monday |
evening, when the committee will meet I
t> name election officers and to transact:
other business. Each committeeman shall
also provide a map of his district, showing
a segregation of precincts into two polling
districts to be numbered one and two
respectively.
The date for the election was left in the
hands of Chairman Chretien to be fixed
by him after conference with the other
committee. The date was later made the
15th inst. The committee adjourned to
meet next Monday evening at Republican
headquarters, 850 Market street.
The proceedings in the conference of the
seven members from the Fifth District
were not so harmonious, though there was
entire unity in favor of an open primary
and on every point except the single one
relating to the regulation of the admission
of watchers to the polling-booths.
The seven seated themselves on the
stage and at once elected C. W. Manwar
ing chairman and John Jackson secretary.
Secretary Jackson read a draft of a call,
leaving blank places for dates. The call
was the same as that adopted for ihe
Fourth District.
When tne reading was finished Jesse E.
Marks objected to the provision requiring
representatives of all sets of candidates to
present credentials signed by the chair- I
man and secretary of the committee â¢
after thoy have been recommended I
by a majority of the candidates i
to secure admission to the booths
to watch the voting and counting. Marks
wanted the call amended so as to give the
individual commirteeman of each district
sole power to is&uo such credentials. In
this he was at once supported by I. H.
Thompson and in some degree by James
Alva Watt. This preposition was dis
cussed for nearly an hour.
Watt suggested that the credentials be
signed by the chairman and secretary "or"
by the county committeeman.
Chairman Manwaring strongly object
ed to any plan which might result in
shutting out the representatives of any
faction, which, he intimated, might pos
sibly be done during a time of excitement
or dispute if one man had the sole power
to say who might enter # the polling
places.
â¢'The number to be admitted should be
regulated ertd limited," declared Manwar
ing. '"We don't want the polling places
filled up with a crowd amid which some
thing wrong may be done. Do you think
that the chairman and secretary are going
to shut out anybody who ha 3 a right to be
inside? '
"If yon won't trust me I won't trust
you," said Marks in reply. "You don't
know the people in my district, and I do."
"Yon forget that the watchers must be
named by a majority of the candidates
before credentials may be issued. My
power i 3 limited. Yours would not be.
All I want is to see that at the last minute
nobody is shut out and that no cinches are
played."
Thompson declared that he waited to
run his district, and tnat he didn't want
any interference. He contended that each
county committeeman should run the pri
mary in his own district.
Finally James Aiva Watt proposed an
amendment that the number of watchers
in any polling place at one time be limited
to thecounty committeeman of the district
and two representatives of each ticket in
the field, the representatives to be
named by a majority of the candidates,
the total number to be limited to six at
one time, and credentials to be issued by
the chairman and secretary of the com
mittee or by tne county committeeman of
he district.
The discussion as it went on was a repe
tition of the points above expressed and
finally a vote was taken on Watt's amend
ment. The ayes were J. A. Watt, Jesse E.
Marks and J. H. Thompson.
The noes were C. M. Manwaring, C. G.
Clinch, Grove Avers and John Jackson.
The amendment was thus lost. By the
same vote reversed the original provision
was approved.
A short discussion ensued, which showed
that the differences were honest ones and
Messrs. Thompson and Clinch urged an
adjournment until next day, when they
thought a harmonious agreement might
be reached on the point which had been
in issue.
Watt pointed out that the precincts
must be segregated- into polling districts,
and he too urged an adjournment.
C. G. Church, wno approved the call as
read, thought that in the interest of har
mony and good feeling an adjournnvnt
might be wise, and one was taken until
this evening, when the committee will
meet in the office of James Alva Watt and
officially adopt the call.

Suicide of a Defaulter.

Bitumen.
THAT WILL BE A START.
Then They Will Go After the

BOARD OF TRADE ORGANIZED
Wheelmen, Liverymen,. Horsemen and
Others Will Be Asked
to Assist.
The intimation given out that during
the present year the cable systems of Mar
ket and Howard streets would be replaced
by an electric streetcar system has caused
the dealers in bicycles, as well as bicyclists
themselves, to do considerabl thinking.
&an Francisco is about the worst paved
City for its size in Christendom, and the
wheelmen here, as well as elsewhere, have
been the first to appreciate the fact.
Last night a large meeting of bicycle
dealers was held in the parlors of Thomas
H. B. Varney's bicycle establishment on
Market street. The meeting was called to
order by H. J." Bryan, who made an ad
dress setting forth the objects of the or
ganization, the chief one of which was to
get good streets. Good streets advanced
the sale of bicycles and helped traffic and
business in general. â¢ :
The speaker gave some interesting
statistics. Paris with a population of
2,500,000 had 150,000 bicycle- riders, a per
centage of 6 in every 100 of the popula
tion. "Washington, D. C, with a popula
tion of 230,000 had 11,000 wheelmen, or
about 4)jj in every 100. Chicago had
1,200,000 population and 60,000 wheelmen,
or 5 per cent of the population. Los An
geles had 5000 bicycle-riders out of a
population of 80,000, or about 6 per cent,
while San Francisco with a population of
300,000 had 6000 wheelmen, or 2 per cent.
There must be some good reason, the
speaker said, for the disproportionately
small percentage between San Francisco
and the other cities mentioned, and the
..chief reason was the fact that the streets
oi those cities were better paved than those
of Ban Francisco.
The speaker was of the opinion that it
was time for bicycle-dealers, wheelmen,
the Merchants' Association, truckmen,
liverymen, horsemen and all others whose
interests lie in the direction of good
streets to unite and use their influence
politically, socially and individually to se
cure pood streets. He advised that in case
an organization should be effected it would
not be well to scatter its energies all over
the City, but it should unite upon some
important proposition at first. Market
street being the main artery of the City,
and leading directly to the ferries, should
bo the first aim of the organization. They
should leave no effort untried to secure the
paving of that thoroughfare with bitumin.
oiis rock.
Such an organization, he said, would
have a powerful influence, politically and
otherwise, in obtaining whatever they de- :
manded. It would not be necessary to
enter into partisan politics, but they could
unite in the support of the candidates who
would pledge themselves as being in favor
of pood streets.
Thomas H. B. Varney was selected as
temporary chairman and James Joyce as
secretaiy. Mr. Varney announced that it
was the intention of the railroad people to
convert the cable system into electric
roads.
' â¢'lf they tear up the Market-street slot
we will nave a picnic in the bicycle busi
ness," said Mr. Varney. "We are here to
sell bicycles, and if we can't do something
to sell them we had better quit."
. Mr. Varney proceeded to say
that the wheelmen had shown what a
force they were in politics by the election
of Justice of the Peace Kerrigan, who ran
ahead of his ticket by a higher vote than
any one else, excepting, perhaps, Mayor
Sutro. "If we have nice streets many
more people will come here to live and we
can sell more bicycles and it will be better
for all kinds of business. If we can get to
gether with the Merchants' Association,
the horsemen and the bicycle clubs we can
â¢ say to a candidate, 'Are you going to give
us good streets?' and if he is not in favor
we can unite against him," added Mr.
Varney.
E. Mohris called attention to the fact
that a few years ago Mayor Pond made a
:great effort toward the paving of Market
street with bitumen, but nothing what
ever came of it. The Democratic nominee
and the Republican nominee for Superin
tendent of Streets promised that they
" would give good streets, but the man who
was elected did not keep his promise. Mr.
Mohrig could not see that anything could
be effected in a political way unless they
put up their own candidate.
â E.E. Buckleton suggested that the bi
cycle-dealers of San Francisco should form
themselves into an association with sev
eral objects for the benefit of the business.
ll' suggested the formation of a board of
trade.
â W. B. Morrill suggested the appoint
ment of a committee to adopt a constitu
tion and by-laws.
Secretary Joyce remarked that there
were other things besides good streets that
affected the bicycle business. Twelve
-hundred wheelmen of this City, he said,
. were associated together in bicycle clubs,
and their co-operation, as well'as that of
the liverymen and carriage-men, could be
secured. ' He told about a man who drove
a. 5250 buggy about the streets for six years
ami who had to put it in the repair-shop
â every two months.
The secretary was of the opinion that it
might not answer to go into politics, but
the hoard could appoint good committees
to work the matter up. The lighting of
the park was another improvement which
the organization could advocate.
â¢ W. J. KennejT of the Bicycle Protective !
Association pledged the assistance of the i
body represented by him.
J. 8. Con well said that to bituminize
Market street.it would be necessary to '
procure a petition signed by a certain per
centage of the foot frontage. The Super
intendent of Streets was merely a servant
of the Supervisors. Rents on Market
street, he added, wore higher than those
on .Broadway, New York, and higher than
those on State street. Chicago, in propor
tion to the , business chances, and the
Market-street tenants were, therefore, en
titled to as good service as the merchants
of the other cities. Supervisors in sym
pathy with good roads should be selected.
.Messrs.' :blosson, MorriJl, â  Devaney,'
Hamilton and others expressed them
selves in favor of organizing.:
R. C. Lennie suggested that the organ
ization should be an independent body
anil not connected with the National
Board of Trade. It would have more
Ircedom of action and would not be sub
ject to a tax. . . â¢.: ...--.
it was finally decided to organize under
â the name ol the San Francisco Cycle Board
-of Trade. â  â â;-' ; L
Messrs. Bryan, .Conwell, and Buckleton
were appointed a committee on constitu
tion and bj4Â»itt. Messrs. Devaney,
Primings and Hamilton were appointed a
committee to acquire information as to the
most feasible method of obtaining the
desired improvement.
The secretary was instructed to notify
all bicycle-dealers to attend the meeting
next Thursday evening at 7:30 o'clock.
WILL NOT BITUMINIZE.
The FoUoui - Street Boulevard Must
Wait Until the Next Fiscal
Year.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday that the
proposed bituminizing of Folsom street
from Third to Sixth must be abandoned
for the present, in accordance with the re
port of the Superintendent of Streets that
all the funds in the Street Department ap
propriation for the present fiscal year will
be exhausted by improvements already or
dered.
This will be a severe blow to the advo
cates of the Folsom boulevard, it having
been hoped by the property-owners that
the proposed new pavement on the blocks
mentioned would bean entering wedge for
the complete bituminizing of the thorough
fare. For the same reason the committee
refused to recommend the reconstruction
of Steuart, between Folsom and Harrison,
or the grading of Twenty -first from
Sanchez to Noe.
All of these improvements will be pro
vided for in the appropriation for the next
fiscal year. ___^___________
DICK WILLIAMS INDICTED
Collector Wise Unable to Save
the Custom-House In
spector.
The Federal Grand Jury Will Return
a True Bill â His Dismissal
Expected.
The United States Grand Jury will in
dict Richard Williams to-day. This
action was decided upon when the body
met last Tuesday.
Williams is the Custom-house inspector
whom Collector Wise has been making
such a hard tight to save. But c% r en the
influence of the Collector has failed to save
Williams, and his scalp will now dangle
at the belt of Special Agent Moore of the
Treasury Department. An indict
ment by the Grand Jury will
be equal to a dismissal, and it is probable
that Secretary Carlisle will telegraph the
Collector to have his favored inspector
placed on the retired list.
Collector Wise has stood by Williams
through all his troubles, but is now forced
to retire from the field in favor of his old
enemy of the treasury service, Major
Moore.
The belief is general in Federal circles
that the triai of Williams will develop
some racy matters relative to the contro
versy which has been going on for some
time between Collector Wise and Major
Moore. And the indictment of Williams
will only increase this long-standing antag
onism. Wise is bitter against Moore, and
Moore is not burdened with love for
Wise. And so with such a strong and
uncompromising hatred between two
high officials of the United States Govern
ment the subordinates in the different de
partments of the service are watching the
outcome with great expectancy.
The Williams case is said to be only a
side issue of the fight between Moore and
Wise. His passing from the scenes of his
former activity and usefulness is of little
moment. He will join the great proces
sion of sorehends that daily sun them
selves in front of the big building on
Washington street and discuss the glories
of the past and the sorrows of the prefent.
Williams was only a Customs Inspector.
He conversed with the Chinese in their
native tongue, and being otherwise
smooth of speech and thrifty of step, he
was especially prized by the Collector of
the Port. But in an absent-minded hour,
it is said of him, he allowed the shifty
Mongolian to drop a few yellow coins into
his hand, and, presto, change. Some
native sons and daughters of the Chinese
empire were unlawfully landed at this
port. That is one of the reasons why
"Dick" Williams will be indicted by the
Federal Grand Jury to-day.
SERIES OF HOLY WEEK
His Grace the Archbishop
Officiates at the Cathe
dral.
Impressive Ceremonies, Eloquent Ser
mons and Large Attendance
of Worshipers.
Large congregations are attending the
Holy Week services in the Catholic
churches. At the Cathedral yesterday
morning his Grace the Archbishop cele
brated the pontifical mass and consecrated
the holy oils. The ceremonies were most
impressive, the procession of the holy
eucharist being one of the most striking
leatures of the imposing service.
The Archbishop was attended by the
Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast, Vicar-
General, as assistant priest; Revs. P. J.
Cummings and Peter S. Casey as deacons
ot honor, and Revs. Charles Ramm ana
Joseph Conway as deacon and sub-deacon
at the altar. The masters of ceremonies,
Revs. Joseph F. Byrne and T. Mulligan,
evidently understood their business, for
the iong and intricate ceremonial was gone
through without a single hitch.
About twenty priests took part in the
service, besides the required number of dea
cons and sub-deacons, all robed in vest
j ments of cloth of gold according: to the
rank of each. The chanters during the
consecration of the holy oils were Revs. J.
F. Byrne and Jerome Hannigan. The
repository for the eucharist is magnifi
cently adorned with flowers, lights and
hangings, transforming St. Joseph's chapel
into a bower of beauty.
In the evening the rosary was recited
and a sermon on the institution and per
petuation of the eucharistic sacrament
and sacrifice delivered by Father Conway.
io-uay his Grace the* Archbishop will
officiate at the mornine service, being
attended by Father Ramm as deacon and
Father Conway as sub-deacon. The
"passion" will be sung in a most impres
j sive manner. Father Byrne taking the part
I of the Saviour, Father Conway that of the
evangelist and Father Hannigan that of
the rabble. In the evening the Arch
bishop will lead in the devotion of the
"Way of the Cross," the "Stabat Water"
being sung by tlie male choir of the
Cathedral.
A sermon will also be preached by the
Rev. Father Byrne on the sufferings and
death of Christ, considered in their practi
cal bearings uiton the spiritual life of to
day. Futlier Byrne, who is a "native
son, " is much admired for the depth and
originality of his sermons, whicn in the
opinion of competent judges cannot be ex
celled as forcible and elegant presentations
of Catholic teuchings.
Zola would not take honors as a gourmet.
He employs a good cook, but eats sparingly
himself and is careful as to wines. His
dinners are daintily served.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL, 3, 1896.
VERY EASY FOR PEPPER
Captured the Rich Crocker Stake
at Ingleside Without
Effort.
THE FAVORITES FARED WELL.
Ladies' Day Drew the Usual Big
Crowdâ Babe Murphy Downed
Adolph Spreckels Driving.
Reopening day at Ingleside track was
attended by a big crowd. The public seem
to repose a confidence in the racing at the
new track that is lacking at the old one,
especially since the Little Pete exposure,
and the betting-riug is always crowded.
The occasion was also "Ladies' day,' 1 and
the fair sex filled the grand stand. The
excellent band added to the gayety of the
scene, discoursing popular airs during the
intervals between races, and as four of the
six first choices reached the wire in front
the talent and the crowd in general voted
the da3''s sport a most enjoyable one.
The electric annunciator in the betting
ring proved quite a novelty. As the horses
flash past the wire an electric light il
luminates the numbers of the first three.
The numbers are conspicuously displayed
at one end of the betting-ring and much
questioning and confusion is avoided by
the new innovation.
The track was in fine condition and good
time was made in the different events.
Starter Dick Havey dispatched bis fields
quickly, and in a manner that was a
revelation. California has at least one
production that is a success.
The Crocker stake, the great long-dis
tance event, over two and a half miles.

was the stellar attraction of the day. Five
went to the post to try for the rich $2QU)
prize. From a racing standpoint the event
was a disappointment, for Pepper won in
hollow style. Decided under selling con
ditions, Pat Dunne's brown horse was in
with but ninety-eight pounds in the sad
dle, and ruled a hot 9 to 20 favorite in the
betting. Flirtilla, second choice in the
betting, made the pace for six furlongs,
when Sloan, on Fred Gardner, let out a.
wrap, and the chestnut horse made the
running up tothÂ« last six furlongs. Coch
ran then gave the favorite his head, and
taking the lead, the son of Hindoo passed
the wire the easiest of winners, with
Flirtilla finishing in place, six lengths in
front of Oakland. The distance was cov
ered in 4 :37.
The first event on the programme was a
four-furlong dash for two-year-olds. Early
Notice, the Burns & Waterhouse entry,
was a2to 1 favorite, but could finish no
better than fourtn. Amelia S, a 10 to 1
outsider, led to the saddling paddock, and
then she "blew up." Scarborough, witn
Beauchamp up, then won cleverly from
St. Dunstan. The winner was backed
down from sixes to 3to 1. The favorite
was third.
The six-furlong run under selling condi
tions, that was next called, resulted in a
very pretty contest between the 9 to 5
seconu choice Kowalsky and the outsider
Toano. The latter and the 4to 5 favorite
William Pinkerton raced out in front at a
great clip up to the stretch, when the lat
ter had enough. Kowalsky then came on
and in a hard drive won by a head. The
Spreckels entry Gallant was third.
The most exciting finish of the day was
furnished at the conclusion of tne mile
and a sixteenth selling event. It ended in
a victory for the even money choice. Babe
Murphy, but only after a hard struggle
with the second choice, Adolpb Spreckels.
The Corrigan entry took the lead on the
backjtretch, swinging around the turn tor
home a length before the favorite. In a
hard drive to the wire Babe managed to
reach the finishing point first by a neck.
Uncle Giles was a lair third.
The presence of Magnet caused all but
Logan and Sam Leake to scratch out of
the fiftti event at seven furlongs. Dan
Honig's crack was a prohibitive 1 to 6 fa
vorite and won all by himself, with Logan
finishing in the place.
The final race of the day, the mile and
three-eighths over five hurdles, was taken
in a hard drive by Sir Reel, backed down
from 3t02 to even money. The old rogue
made all the running, but when headed
once, less than a furlong from the wire, by
Talbot Clifton's jumper, The Lark, it
looked all up with him, but he responded
to Spence's call and passed the stand half
a length in front.
Track and Paddock Items.
The ring was hit hard by the victory of
Sir Reel. The ladies as well as the plung
ers had a bet on him, and the lines were
very lengthy back of the bookmakers'
stands after the race.,
Hello, who is considered a very sure
jumper, tumbled at the very first jump
and dislodged his rider, George Uochran,
from the saddle.
Pieire Wiboux, the Montana turfman
who was conspicuous by his absence the
past few days at the BaY District track,
was again in the ring yesterday.
Fonsetta, the dam of Scarborough, was
once owned by Peter Weber. The mare
was bullet fast, but was very fond of stop
ping to pick strawberries during the race.
Young Snider put up a very good ride on
old Toano. The lad shows marked im
provement in his riding.
Fort Tow nit mil Accident.
PORT TOWNSEXD, Wash., April 2.â
Lorin Chase, the son of a prominent pio
neer family here, yesterday met with an
accident which may cost him his life. He
was driving a team in Bishop's logging
camp and when hauling down hill was
caught, between two logs ana his right leg
crushed to a jelly. He was brought here
this morning on a steamer and taken to a
hospital, where a surgeon amputated a leg
twenty hours after the accident. The
young man's life is despaired of.
IS NOT THE STRANGLER.
What the Police Have Been
Able to Learn About
Julius Festner.
He Will Be Examined by the Insan
ity Commissioners as to His
Mental Condition.
Julius Festner of Omaha, Neb., who in
sulted Miss Fennell of Hyde and Pine
street 3 Wednesday night, is apparently
not the man who strangled Mamie Mc-
Dermott and Bertha Paradis, but it lias
not yet been shown that he was not the
man who attempted to strangle Irene
Phillips and Laura Petit.
Yesterday morning Detective Bohen,
who has had charge of the strangling
cases, saw Festner in his padded cell in
the Receiving Hospital and he was siruck
by his similarity to the man described by
several women who attempted to strangle
them.
Haifa dozen of these women had a look
at Festner in the hospital and they all said
they had never seen him before, Detective
Bohen went for Irene Phillips and Laura
Petit, but found they had gone to the
races. It was his intention to get them to
call at the hospital Jast night, but lie de
cided it would be better to wait till this
morning.
A young lady who was followed by a
man on Pacific Heights about ten days ago
and insulted also hau a look at Festner
yesterday, but failed to recognize him.
Detective Bohen made inquiries about
Festner yesterday and ascertained that he
left Omaha on March 12 for this City. He
would arrive here about four days later, so
that disposed of the suspicion that he was
the man who strangled Mamie McDer
mott and Bertha Paradis. As stated in
yesterday's Call he registered at the Gol
den West Hotel on March 22, and his
movements from the time of his arrival
till that date are not yet known.
The police have ascertained that Fest
ntr was intoxicated most of the time he
nas bepn here. He was a familiar figure
in several well-known sporting saloons in
the "tenderloin district," where he fur
nished amusement to the patrons by play
ing the zither.
Frederick Louderback, a zither player,
who has rooms in the Supreme Court
building, knew Festner fifteen years ago
in Omaha. He called upon Louderback
about a fortnight ago, who observed that
he acted strangely and the thought came
to him that he had lost his reason. After
his first visit Festner visited Louderback
frequently and borrowed small sums of
money from him.
Policeman McLaughlin, who arrested
Festner Wednesday night, swore to a
complaint yesterday morning charging
him with insanity. Miss Fennel! and I
some of her friends accompanied Mc-
Laughlin. Festner was taken before
Judge Wallace for examination, but he
was remanded tiil to-day to enable the
police to get witnesses. Festner wa.s vio
lent in his cell all yesterday and had to be
strapped down.

How Anarchists Prevented
the Band From Play
ing On.
WAS THE ROYAL MARCH.
And Gori's Followers Did Not
Relish Its Particular
Strain.
FAREWELL BANQUET TO GORI.
Speeches Made and Toasts Drunk.
The Anarchist Leaves To-Day
for Los Angeles.
The anarchists of this City and the inti
mate friends and admirers of Pietro Gori
gave a grand farewell banquet to their
leader yesterday evening at the new Tos
cano Hotel on Broadway. To-day he
leaves for Los Angeles, en route for Cuba,
and the anarchists expect to feel, for a
time at least, like sheep without a shep
herd.
There were over fifty persons at the Dan
quet last night, about ten of them being
lady converts to the principles which Gori
expounds. There was no doubt about
those principles last night; they
were expressed ai brief intervals all
through the banquet, both in sone
and speech. A brass band, stationed
in a room adjoining the banquet hall, be
gan to play the "Marseillaise" about the
time the olives were beine served, and the
keen edge of the guests' appetites did not
prevent nine-tenths of those present from
joining lustily in the refrain "To Arms,
Citizens."
It was not the "Marsellaise," however,
but the "Royal March" of Italy that was
the sensation of the evening. The musicians
had found the "Marsellaise" and encore 3
to the "Marsellaise" such a complete suc
cess that they were emboldened to try the
effect of the "Royal March.' 1 No sooner
did the patriotic strains strike the ears of
the anarchists than there was a storm
of whistles and catcalls. The band
played on, but before many seconds had
passed the players saw that the air was
dense with a shower of projectiles that
were thrown over the frail partition sepa
rating the bandroom from the banquet
ing-room. Bits of paper, bread, bananas â
anything light and airy that came first to
hand was seized by the anarchists and
hurled amid a shower of hisses at the per
formers, who had the audacity to play the
'â Royal March."
The musicians escaped without any more
serious injury than the shock to their
nerves, but a small, hard loaf entered the
mouth of the tromba and became so firmly
wedged there that the instrument was un
litted for further usefulness for the rest of
the evening. After the experience with
the "Royal March" the troinbaless
band confined itself to the "Marseillaise"
and the "Garibaldi Hymn" for the end of
the evening, and as a reward there was
nothing but approbation and applause.
Tue guests also sang a number of Pietro
Gori's "Anarohici Rivoluzionari" songs,
particularly the ''Farewell v Lugano"
and "11 Primo Maggio" ("The First of
May").
Gori was, of course, the guest of honor,
and beside him sat ft. B. Cevasco, proprie
tor of the newspaper La Voce del l'opolo,
while A. Serafini, his friend ana disciple,
sat opposite, and G. Buzzoni, editor of
the Trimup , of Thought, sat close at hand.
The banquet was an excellent one, served
in thorough Italian style. Toward its
close Signora A. Gaffe, the lady orator of
the Italian colony, was called on for a
speech. The lady replied by alluding to
what Gori had achieved during his two
months' stay in this City. She said he had
taught principles of gentleness and peace,
the principles of the future. Before his
coming tnere were many people who had
been blindly groping in the dark, uncon
sciously yearning for those great princi
ples, but Gori had shown them the way
and now they had been able. to embrace
them. "We beg him to carry to all other
confederations our salutations, and to take
the same courage and hope to the unhappy
elsewhere that he has brought to us."
After Mrs. Gaffe's speech there was load
applause, followed by cries of "Gori."
The anarchist responded by making a
brief speech. "Friends, there are mo
ments when in the silence of our ideas the
heart speaks more than words. A dis
course in thi? meeting of friends would be
out of place, and I will try to sum up my
feelings for yon, my friends and sym
pathizers, in a few poor -words.
"I thank you, and I will carry to other
toilers your "fraternal salutations. I feel
the irresistible sentiment of the ultimate
triumph of our ideas. Here is Signor Ce
vasco, who represents the capitalist class,
inclining before our views, and others will
do so.''
Signor Cevasco murmured a denial of
the soft impeachment that he represented
the capitalistic class, but Gori, unmoved
by this protest, continued by expressing
a hope that the chain of anarchist laborers
would soon spread round the world and
that his hearers should be proud of being
in the vanguard of the movement. After
his brief speech the anarchist's health was
drunk with acclamations and "Evvivas."
Gori will leave to-day for Los Angeles,
but his admirers declare that the seed of
anarchy which he has planted in this City
will grow and flourish.
A writer who had a dinner with Dickens
says the menu was Whitstable oysters, a
browned sole, a baked leg of mutton with
oysters and veal sturling and a gin punch.
The same man went to see Carlyle and
after mentioning that he had dined with
Longfellow told the sage a very funny
stoiy which made Carlyle absolutely
laugh; but all the philosopher did in re
turn was to ask if his guest would have a
cup of tea.

strong, vigorous and rugged. It was only
a short time ago when he was a sick man,
a tired, weary day laborer. He could
digest no food, had pains in his liver and
pains over the kidneys. He suffered from
exhaustion, exposure, cold and overwork.
In his own words:
The Edwin \V. Joy Company:
Gentlemenâ l may not be able to tell you in
fine language the great gratitude I feel, but I
can tell it just the same. A short time ago I
was on the flat of my back with pains all over
my body and pains in my stomach. I used
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla for two weekj and
my bowels became regular, hihl I could feel
that I was gt-ttiiiK on. I continued to use Joy's
Vegetable .sar>ai>arilla until I was well enough

Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is the great
California remedy, of which so much has
already been said. More than 10,000 testi-
monials are in the olh'ce of Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. It is good for the blood, liver

FRIDAY APRIL 3, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
On the Roentgen ray mystery California
says to the world "Eureka!"
If the fight against the funding bill is
well kept up it will come out on top.
After this bungling administration the
main issue before the people is to turn the
fools out.
When Vining doesn't get a roast for his
street railroad mismanagement he calls it
a cold day.
By and by lur. Rainey will come to the
conclusion that the Junta is a fire and try
to put it out.
Democracy will never be straightened
out until it is driven to a good strong wall
and nailed there.
There is no more use to discuss a fund
ing bill than to discuss a rattlesnakeâ the
thing is to kill it.
There is a chance that the local Demo
cratic campaign song may be something
like Lanigan's bawl.
Mr. Dopew will understand we expect
him to tell the people in the East that San
Francisco is a peach.
It is even betting whether the Cuban
resolution or the Cuban revolution will
make the quicker finish.
The Dygart incident gives Cleveland a
chance to write a mes3age on Cuban affairs
and say something strong.
The only policy on the funding scheme
that California needs is to enforce the law
and turn the defaulters out.
The next social volcano to break loose in
something like a war i< just as liable to be
in Manitoba a* anywhere els?.
Germany waÂ« lirst on the trail of the
elusive X ray. but California is the hrst to
track it to its lair and capture it.
Senator Chandler finds something to
srold about even in his own State, so the
Senate needn't complain any more.
It is an easy prediction that the attend
ance on the Lanigan ball will be slim if it
Should happen to be a Rainey night.
It would be better to have the business
of the country set in motion by a silver
crank than stopped by a goldbug plug.
By and by New Jersey farmers will just
sit down and wait for ocean steamers to
come along and plow the soil for them.
Cleveland evidently regards his syndi
cate bond deal as a sleight-of-hand per
formance, and objects to giving it away.
Tne proposed bridge across the bay is
one of the things that will have to be
talked over a long time before it is walked
over.
If Mr. Vanderbilt will look closely he
will see that the only thing lacking to the
prosperity of this City is a competing rail
road.
The only way to get the monopoly out of
the politics of the State is to make it take
its monopoly grasp off the industry of the
State.
It will not be safe to declare that Harri
son is permanently out of politics until
we see how he acts when the honeymoon
is over.
New Hampshire doesn't agree with Mas
sachusetts on the money question, but she
agrees with the country, fox she stands for
bimetallism.
According to French reports, the Drei
bund is willing that England should help
Italy out, but is not willing that England
should stay in.
It was the Huntington hand that
dragged the appropriation from San
Pedro, and by and by that hand will get
hit with a pile-driver.
Arizona is a little bit happy with her
new Governor, but it goes without saying
she would rather be a State and have a
chance to elect one for herself.
The Pacific roads' debts will never be
settled until they are settled right. To re
fund the debt would prolong the fight, but
the people will win in the end.
The Boers will help the British fight
the Matabeles, and the white conquest of
South Africa will go on as if those engaged
in it had never had a squabble.
Congressman Bowers' resolution for the
expulsion of silver men from the House
was a very good illustration of the effect
iveness of irony in a contest with brass.
If the Vanderbilt and Depew combina
tion expect us to believe they came here
solely for recreation they will have to stay
over until the festivals open and see the
whole show.
Europe has now nothing to do but sit
down and wait until Russia makes up her
mind whether she would rather have a war
this year or go on and complete the Sibe
rian railroad.
It has been demonstrated by Berkeley
scientists that cathode rays positively
electrify any tolid upon which they im
pinge, and consequently the Republican
party being solid will be electrified by the
cathode rays of politics this year, while
flabby Democracy will show up only as a
blur on the background.
THE PEIMAEY ELECTION.
The Republican County Central Com
mittee met last evening and resolved
itself into committees for the Fourth and
a part of the Fifth Congressional dis
! tricts respectively. The committee repre
senting the Fourth District then pro
ceeded to call a primary election to be
held on April Iff, at which the Republi
cans of San Francisco may express their
preferences for delegates to the coming
f?tate Convention. The committee repre
senting the Fifth District will undoubt
edly follow the example. This action
is in accordance with the letter and spirit
uf the resolutions of the Republican Na
tional and State Central committees, and
is also in harmony with the popular idea
as to the proper method of opening a po
litical campaign.
The primary election is a safeguard to
liberty of political action. It is the peo
ple's place to make their influence felt in
the very framework of political party or
ganization. Its honest conduct insures a
large degree of independence in the con
ventions which succeed it, and discourages
the aim of the unworthy to rise to power
in deliance of the popular will. The mem
bers of the County Committee have there
fore acted wisely in resolving that an
honest and open primary election shall be
held in San Francisco this year.
A study of the call which has been
adopted and is issued justifies the hope
that the coming primary election will be
open, honest and fair. Especial precau
tions appear to have been taken to insure
these conditions and to guarantee to every
voter thereat the right to have his one
ballot peaceably cast and honestly counted
for the delegates of his choice. The char
acter of the leaders who are at the helm of
the Republican party of California is an
added assurance that this guarantee will
be iully and exactly kept at the coming
primaries. The City of San Francisco
may well felicitate herself with the fact
tnat an era of honest politics has fairly
dawned for her people and that the winter
of her discontent is past.
BEIDGING THE BAY.
The suggestion made by Lyman Bridges
of a bridge across the bay from the foot of
Folsom street to the nearest point of the
Alameda peninsula is certainly attractive.
That a bridge will some day span the bay
may be taken for granted. At present the
conimfirce of the whole State suffers a
heavy tax by reason of the necessity for
ferrying freight across the water, TÂ«his
gives Oakland a large natural advantage
over San Francisco, though the absence of
adequate water-front facilities nullifies the
benefit. In the event of a favorable de
cision on the suits pending for the Oak
land water front the absolute necessity for
a bridge across the bay will arise. Before
this will occur, however, a vast amount of
capital and many years of time will be re
quired to make the Oakland water front
suitable for the shipping of the harbor.
â  All these things are likely to come about
! in time, and hence it is proper to discuss
the bridging of the bay as a serious propo
sition. The question will be, Where should
the bridge be placed?
Mr. Bridges' suggestion makes the
bridge bisect the traffic of the bay. South
of the line connecting Folsom street and
Alameda Point are the large steamship
docks, the warehouses of the Southern
Pacific Company, the terminus of the San
' Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
' road, the Union Iron Works, the Arctic
| Oil "Works, the great slaughter-houses of
I the Potrero and Baden and extensive
sugar warehouses. In fact, all the heavy
traffic of the bay would be cut off from the
Golden Gate by the Folsom-street line. It
is true that Mr. Bridges' scheme contem
plates ample drawbridges, but if these can
be avoided an important point would be
gained.
A bridge running from the Potrero to
i Alameda would seem to come nearer the
necessities of the case. South of the Po
trero the bay is shoal, and is little tit for
deep vessels. A bridge at that point
| would terminate near the railroad ware
j houses, and that would be a convenience.
Mr. Bridges' idea is clearly to bring the
bridge as nÂ°ar the ferry depot as possible.
That would be an advantage so far as pas
senger traffic is concerned, but freights
would not be similarly affected, and it
happens that the burden on the State's
traffic conies through freight ferriage, and
not passenger. The saving on passenger
traffic would be little or nothing; on
freight it would be in the neighborhood of
$1 a ton. Hence, all suggestions for a
bridge to span the bay must regard ireight
before passengers. This consideration,
taken in connection with the fact that a
bridge from the foot of Folsom btreet
would hinder bay traffic to a considerable
extent, seems to indicate the neighbor
hood of the Potrero as the best starting
point for the structure.
A DISGRACEFUL ACT.
The people of California will never be
satisfied until some explanation is made
of the extraordinary course of the House
Committee on Rivers and Harbors with
regard to San Pedro and Santa Monica,
It is said that the committee has decided
to reduce the appropriation for the inner
harbor of San Pedro from $392,000 to $50,
--000, to do nothing lor the outer harbor and
to cut out the appropriation for Santa
Monica altogether. Congressman McLach
lan is said to be angry because Congress
men Bower?, Maguire and Barham opposed
the Santa Monica appropriation and thus
caused the committee practically to strike
out both appropriations. This is a quarrel
araone the California Congressmen that
will have to be explained.
Aside from that, it is clear that Mr.
Huntineton was behind the whole trouble.
It was evident to him that any appropria
tion for San Pedro would destroy the
value of the Southern Pacific monopoly of
Santa Monica, and hence he preferred that
Santa Monica should wait rather than see
San Pedro improved. So long as Santa
Monica is dangerous and inadequate and
San Francisco has a safe harbor the
Southern Paciiic can carry the traffic of
Southern California f>oo miles by rail and
charge a round sum for the service. This
would be done away with in the event that
either San Pedro or Santa Monica is im
proved. Mr. Huntington can well afford
to wait for a harbor in Southern Califo rnia.
That it was his influence that secured this
extraordinary action on the part of the
committee no one in this State can be
made to doubt. His power has already
been shown in the matter of the funding
bill.
The question of an appropriation for
these harbors is not entirely settled, as the
decision of the committee seems to have
teen taken in a moment of anger and pet
ulance, and partly because the California
Congressmen had worked at cross-pur
poses. Mr. McLachlan's position seenis to
have been one of willingness for the Santa
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 1896.
Monica appropriation aa a concession to
the Runtington loi-ces, and through fear
that San Pedro would be neglected. Messrs.
Bowers, Barham and Maguire seem to have
opposed the Santa Monica appropriation
because it was manifestly wrong and was
opposed by the united sentiment of Cali
fornia. Hence it does not appear either
that Mr. McLachlan was working in the
interest of the Southern Pacific or that the
others were willing to sacrifice the inter
ests of the State in order to balk the selfish
grab of the railroad. Tne simple truth
very likely is that the Southern Pacific
was willing that both appropriations
should be stricken out in order that San
Pedro should not ba improved and the
possibility of a monopoly at Santa Monica
destroyed. It behooves the entire Califor
nia delegation to arrive at a clear under
standing and work harmoniously to undo
the harm that is threatened.
STATE INVESTMENTS.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald seems to
have made a clear explanation of the
charge that he has opposed thÂ« invest
ment of State school funds in the bonds
issued by various counties of the Slate.
Hi 3 position as stated by himself is that
he has opposed such investments only in
the cases of bonds which he deemed to
have been irregularly issued, and that he
strongly believes the State should in
vest in home bonds in preference to those
issued by the Government, so that the
interest may be kept at home.
Tne contention of the Sacramento Bee,
which made the charge against him, is
that he has passed adverse judgment on
bonds which had already been accepted as
good by responsible banks. Clearly that
fact could have no more weight with the
Attorney-General than to make his in
spection of the bonds all the more thor
ough and his judgment all the more relia
ble. At the same time it is assumed that
the banks have invested only after their
attorneys have passed on the securities.
In such a case it would be merely a differ
ence of opinion between attorneys, and
that is not an extraordinary thing.
The real point in the whole question is
why the Attorney-General, charged as he
is with so grave responsibilities, should
ever have had occasion to question the
manner in which county bonds have been
issued? When we reflect that the bonds
were issued under the sanction of the Dis
trict Attorneys of the counties, and ap
proved by the attorneys employed by the
purchasing banus, the weight of authority
is against the Attorney-General, and his
responsibility is no greater than' that of
either of the other sets of attorneys. Still
his position is more conspicuous and his
advice of a more far-reaching influence.
When he advises against the bonds of any
county the situation is very serious and
requires study.
Were it not for the fact that several
counties have acquired an unpleasant no
toriety for misusing the public funds the
subject might be easily dismissed as one
of a difference of opinion between lawyers.
But that fact alone creates a presumption
in the Attorney-General's favor. Califor
nia has already suffered seriously from
that cause. One of the reasons why it
would be difficult to bond San Francisco
for improvements that would be a wise in
vestment is a fear that some irregularity
would appear in the handling of the funds
as well as the issuance of the bonds. The
State cannot expect to prosper until that
drawback has been removed by resort to
better politics.
LOWER OAR FARES.
In it^ adoption of a resolution favoring
a reduction of the streetcar fare to 3 cents
the Point Lobos Avenue Improvement
Club has set in motion an idea that should
receive the indorsement of every organiza
tion and individual interested in the wel
fare and more rapid development of San
Francisco. There is no doubt that such
a reduction can be made by the railways
without interfering with fair profits being
returned to the stockholders.
It was only the other day that a dividend
was announced by the Market-street Rail
way Company of GO cents for the quarter
ending March 31, 1896. This is equivalent
to an anr.ual dividend of $2 40 on each $100
share of stoctf. Some $18,000,000 worth of
stock has been issued, and as this stocic
ia now quoted at $47 the dividend declared
is equal to about 5 per cent per annum on
the investment. But when it is known that
this $18,000,000 worth of stock is in reality
three times as much as what it actually
cost to construct and equip the 180 odd
miles of single track of this road, it will
be seen that the stockholders are now en
joying more than a fair return for the in
vestment.
Then this company has within the past
year put considerable of its profits into
new electric roads and in the conversion
of some of its horse and cable lines into
electric railways. Not only has this tended
to largely diminish the immediate divi
dend fund, but it has added much to the
future dividend possibilities. The new
lines will bring new traffic and the con
rerted lines are cheaper to operate.
A reduction in fares will also stimulate
traffic, and the increase in travel can be
taken care of with a comparatively less ex
pense to the company, as the cost of roll
ing stock and the pay of the increased
force of men is but a small investment
compared to the cost of constructing a
road. What the actual profits of opera
tion are is shown by figures obtained from
offi6ial sources in reference to tbe Market
street Railway Company. The annual in
come from fares ia about $3,000,000, and
out of this it has been found possible to
declare a dividend equal to $500,000, or
about 17 per cent of the gross earnings,
and this, too, in spite of the burden of
making extraordinary improvements and
additions to the system.
Low streetcar fares and an adequate ser
vice will do more to build up the outside
sections and enhance their value than all
other factors combined. The Point Lobos
avenue people should receive tha necessary
backing in the movement they have in
augurated. ' ;
DIAZ ON THE DOOTEINE.
The able address of President Diaz to
the Congress of Mexico is an open and
hearty acceptance of the Monroe doctrine
and an earnest recommendation that it be
made the policy of all the American re
publics. How this is-to be done President
Diaz does not presume to say, but mani
festly the proper procedure would be an
alliance of all the American republics
for defen3e against European aggression.
Such an alliance might be extended in its
operation to cover other interests that are
common to the republics.
An important consideration in any alli
ance among these countries is a total ao
sence of fear that the United States would
seek to secure undue advantage in the
way either of enlarging its territory at the
expense of its neighbors or of advancing
its commercial interests on selflsh lines.
Although nothing ever occurred until the
raising of the Venezuelan question to
bring about sympathy among the Western
republics, the lesson of that difficulty is
that some kind of political and commer
cial alliance would be wise. The Pan-
American congress was productive of no
substantial results, but that was merely
because the time was not ripe and the re
publics had not yet recognized the im
portance of concerted action.
President Diaz unqualifiedly accepts
the Monroe doctrine as one that does not
concern tne United States alone and sayÃ
the Unitea Stales should not be expected
to support it unaided. The doctrine is
even more vital to the weaker republics
than to the United States, for this Nation,
unlike the others, is physically able to
hold its own against any European power.
It would be exceedingly ungracious on the
part of the southern republics to leave the
United States to support alone a principle
that is more vital to them than us. As
Mexico is the greatest of the republics
next to the United States it may be ex
pected that the example set by President
Diaz will be cheerfully followed by the
smaller states. The next important thing
to be done is such action by the Mexican
Congress as will invest the acceptance of
the principle with the whole dignity and
power of Mexico.
The questions of tariff and finance that
are so serious for the people of the United
States will becomes equally grave with the
southern republics when they shall have
developed their natural resources to the
point attained by us. That is merely a
question of time, but it would be well for
these republics to profit now by the mis
takes which have been committed in the
United States and thus avoid the evils
upon which we have fallen. Upon return
of the Republican party to full power it
should be a leading idea to amalgamate
the interests of all the American republics
by means of a comprehensive agreement
that shall look to the protection of the in
dustries of all the American republics as
well as resistance of any attempt on the
part of Europe to secure a political hold
on this continent.

WHO HAS DONE AS MUCH?
Santa Cruz Sentinel.
Claus Spreckels has given the county a strip
of land forty feet wide and some miles long
leading from the public road to the Aptos
beach to be used as a public road. 'Who of all
the men in this county who hate rich men be
cause they are rich, sneer at them, slur them,
attack them, assault them in the public press,
work the public against them, has done as
much? If there is such a man let him stand
forth. If too modest to do so let his friends do
so for him. A rich man is no better than any
other man equally good who is not rich,
neither is he any worse. If there is any coumv
in the world that needs the introduction o"f
wealth it is this county, and if there is any
city suffering from a lack of capital it is this
city. Did you ever think that there is not a
man in Santa Cruz who has $100,000 in money
on hand, now or heretofore? Did you ever
think how few residents of this county there
are who are each worth if 100,000? You can
count them on the fingers of your hands, and
you wou't have to count your fingers twice.
Could ten men worth $100,000 each be in
duced to move into this county and invest
their $1,000,000, we, who hale them through
envy of their wealth, would clap our hands
with joy, and some of us would at once com
mence laying our pipes to get in on the deal.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Alfred Rosenholz, a Swedish electrician, for
some time connected with, the Union Iron
Works and frequently seen in the corridors of
the Palace, has made a discovery which his
friands think ought to make him known
around the globe. It is in reference to the
difference of temperature of heavenly bodies.
Rosenholz admits that he has gone a good way
otl to make his discovery, but thinks he had as
good a right as Galileo, Sir Isaac Newton and
the rest of them.
"It is the discovery of a law which exists ia
nature," he said, <*not before known." He
added:
' 'This law is in reference to the solar heat
and the lower temperature of the planets, and
what relation temperature bears to atomic
affinity.
"The difference of temperature of any orb
and its companion or companions in the uni
verse is in relation to the distance or weight
of the muss, which opposes by its motion the
force of gravitation.
"Mercury, the first planet outward from the
sun, if he constitute terrestrial matter in pro
portion, it follows by the above law that the
density is much greater than that of the earth.
The density is believed to be about two and a
half times greater than that of our globe.
"The planets increase in temperature as
the diameter of their orbits is increased.
Mars has its orbit outside of the earth, con
sequently his velocity and density is not so
great.
"Owing to the great distance of the giant
planet Jupiter from its central orb, the planet
Alfred Rosenholz, Who Says He Has Dis
covered a New Law in Nature.
must be in a hot state ; a red-hot fiery nucleus,
part of which is occasionally seen whenever a
nortion of one of the great cloud zones is for a
time dispersed.
"Saturn must have a still higher tempera
ture ; in all probability Saturn is composed of
materials similar to those of our globe, yet we
find that the density is so small that it would
float in water.
"That this law will also hold good in the
sidereal heavens with the millions of suns and
their planets is evident beyond any reasonable
| doubt.
"When the stars are closely examined from
time to time it is found that a number of them
alter in brilliancy. Such stars which change
in brilliancy from maximum to minimum are
orbs of nearly the same weight revolving round
one another ; their orbit is necessarily elliptic ;
the higher temperature and brilliancy are man
ifested when they are farthest apart. Stars of
other have the same temperature; but of three
the same weight which revolve around each
orbs of equal weight, the one in the center
would be a bright star, while the orbs in mo
tion would be dark globes. Such must be the
condition of the star Algol, which in general
shines as a second magnitude star; once every
sixty-nine nours, however, it slowly decreases
in brightness. Each time one of the dark com
companions to one of these stars passes exactly
between us and the star a partial eclipse takes
place. It is well ascertained that those dark
globes in mass are nearly equal to the center
orb, which is a bright star.
"How would science with the present
theories of heat and light and atomic affinity
explain this contrast? Still more. How will
they account for the enormous light and heat
given out by similar bodies of matter which
travel through space and are shorn of their
brilliancy when they pass the sun and regain
their luster as they again extend their journey
out in space?
"Science has investigated the source of heat,
but has ignored atomic affinity, assuming it
to be a force that matter possesses by virtue;
its relation to ethereal manifestations is not
well comprehended.
'â¢The comet of Newton, which appeared in
1680, approached the surface of the sun as
close as one-third of the solar diameter, and
was accordingly subjected to a heat over 2000
times greater than the temperature of red
hot iron. Under the action of this enormous
heat the comet appeared to decrease, a result
which would not be expected, as the effect
of an increase of temperature is rather to
expand the mass. It is plainly in accordance
with my discovered law that, such intense
heat would under ordinary conditions exist
ing on earth convert a globe of platina or
carbon into gas if no other force had come
into play during the time the oomet passed
the sun.
"Professor Chambers says in his Cometary
Statistics: 'It should be remarked that the
real dimensions of comets are found to vary
greatly at different periods. There is no doubt
that many of these bodies contract as they ap
proach the sun and expand again as they
recede from it, a fiict first noticed by Kepler.
Enckle's comet in 1838 when approaching the
sun was on October 9 281,000 miles in diam
eter; the 17th of December it had contracted
to 3000 miles in diameter. This must be the
condition of all matter which moves in an
elliptic orbit round the sun; as it gets nearer
to the sun its weight and velocity become
greater, and as a consequence there is a lower
temperature, or a greater attraction between
its atoms and molecules.
"Thus, I think, the above manifested facts
are sufficient to show that as long as there is a
motion there will be a difference of tempera
ture, providing there is a difference of motion.
Every orb or mass of matter in the universe
depends on every other mass for its laws of
attraction. One orb alone cannot come into
existence, as there would be no gravitation, no
affinity, or law. The phenomenon we call heat
would have reached its maximum, while mat
ter would suffer a further division and form a
j neutral lluid diffused throughout space, while
the ether would form worlds and solar sys
tems, with a temperature and laws under a
reverse condition."

In rage and anger high,

OUR SHARE OF THE SEEDS.
The joint resolution of Congress authorizing
the gratuitous distribution of seeds became a
law, without the President's signature, early
in this month, and any gentleman who has
300 tons of seeds which he wishes to sell to
Uncle Sam has until April 15 to send in his
proposal. Each of the ninety Senators, 357
representatives and three Territorial delegates
will be entitled to 15,000 packets of seeds. A
mathematical genius in the Department of Ag
riculture has figured that each honorable will
have a total "of one four hundred and fiftieth
part of two-thirds of each variety."
Boston, through its two representatives, ie en
titled to 30,000 packets of seeds, to say noth
ing of such of the Senatorial packets as it can
ODtain. What beautiful farms we shall have,
to be sure, and bow cheap living will be this
summer. There is a variety of thirty-live kinds,
which we can pick from, ranging from aspara
gus and Brussels sprouts to rutabagas and sal
sify. The 30,000 packets ought to sow about
all the vacant lots in the two districts.
There is going to be a great deal of satisfac
tion in eating the products of these seeds, for
the specifications demand that they must be
true to their name and must be up to the re
quired standards of purity and germination.
For instance, if our Congressman sends us
broccoli seeds, whose purity is not 98 per cent
and germination 85 per cent, or okra seeds,
whose purity is not 99 per cent and germina
tion 86 per cent, we can complain. Just what
redress we can obtain is but vaguely stated,
though we might be able to have the Congress
man censured or the seed-seller put in jail.
We certainly could get some new seeds and try
again.
As we fondly plant our Government seeds
we can do so confident that they are free from
"smut, bunt, ergot, the larvse of insects or the
seeds of the dodder." If there are any resi
dents of the North End who think of cultivat
ing mustard, or any in the Back Bay with a
longing for an onion field, who fear that the
Congressional seeds are not of the best, we beg
to set their minds at rest. Congressional seeds,
according to the requirements of Secretary J.
Scholasticus Morton, are allowed to contain
no Brassica, Camelina sativa, Salsola kali
tragus, Carduus arvensis, Agrostemmajgithago,
Bromus secalinns, Agrapyron repeiis, Thlaspi
arvenoe or Allium vineale. What more couid
you ask? â Boston Journal.
AN EFFECTIVE WAIST BESIGN.
The new fancy velvets when made up into
round waists need to be made on simple lines.
The model shown here is ideal for the purpose.
The bishop sleeve is one of the new features of
those round waists. A charming one, when
made of this fashion, was of Parisian design,
with collar, sleevebands and shoulder straps
of bright red velvet ribbon.
One in velvet, showing red, blue, green and
Dlack, was exquisite with trimmings of Per
sian lamb fur, which formed the bands for the
sleeves, for the shoulders, and was also laid
in a three-inch band down the center front
The collar was of the velvet, with points of the
fur.
Royal blue velvet with tails of the sable over
the shoulders, around the neck and sleeve
bands was royally rich. The effect of a basque
portion attained by tails sewn to the bottom of
the waist at the back, from the under-arm
seams, brightened the effect.
A China silk, in a green tone, exquisitely
trimmed with brown velvet, was designed to
be worn with a brown skirt.
A waist of black satin made after this model
with detachable shoulder-straps, sleeve-bands
collar and belt of China ribbon (a light green
shadeisagoodcombination)lmakesaserviceabe
waist, for the accessories may be raised indefi
nitely. A white satin stock collar is one of the
newest fancies, and with a round collar of lace
or a square one of white batiste, makes an en
tire change. A fichu of black chiffon with an
edge of white Brussels work makes another
very stylish trimming. This may be left hang
ing loose in front or tied around the waist in
the back. __^_____^^__

PECULIAR OPTICAL ILLUSION.
If the architects of the new City Hall dome
could see their work only from the hill on the
north side of McAllister street, just beyoDd the
streetcar power-house, they would most likely
be thrown into consternation, as a peculiar
combination of light and shade makes the
structure look as if it was about to take a
tumble on top of the Lick statuary. The causei
for the illusion are not hard to find. It cannot
be noticed in the morning when the sun is
behind it, as that throws the vast pile Into a
silhouette and gives no chance for the i play oÂ£
shadows that are apparent in the afternoon
A first glance at the dome from the top of
Appearance of the Dome of the l*ew
City Hall from .McAllister-StreÂ«t Hills.] I
[From a sketch.)
the hiil mentioned has a most startling
effect on the observer. Not only does the
structure appear out of plumb vertically, but
all of the floors appear to slant down on the
southern side. The copper dome on the top
looks as if ready- to roll off and the bronze
angel has the effect of getting ready to take
a plunge Into space, just as If it had already
become tired of offendiug the artistic senses of
the people. . _
The principal cause of the illusion is the
polished copper dome, that so catches the
glare of the sun as to be broken up into a
number of planes of light and shade. The
strong light on one side of the globe causes a
portion of it to disappear from view. On the
top ot Devisadero-street hill a clump of poplars
grow in just the right place to produce the
effect of being the continuation of the line of
the dome. They meet the edge of the dome
! at their tops and from there slant downward
to the north and blend in with the other build
ings near by.
On the south side of the dome a building,
that is light in color, so cuts into the shadow
j of the dome as to produce the effect of bending
i the side line inward. The unbalanced com
! position of the lines in the buildings over
i which the dome can be seen are such as to
strengthen the illusion.
Only the upper portion of the dome shows
above the Devisadero-street hill, which in it
' self produces a somewhat grotesque effect.
The buildings of the City Hall proper seem to
have melted into the ground. From the hill
on the opposite side of .McAllister street the Il
lusion is not visible.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Probable Race Between the Pilot-
Boat Bonita and Yacht
Coronet.
WOULD BE A CLOSE CONTEST.
The California Boat Would Make the
New York Yacht Club Crack
Hustle.
Now for a race between the pilot- boat
Bonita and the New York yacht Coronet.
The Pilot-Boats Gracie S, America and Bouita as They Appeared Yesterday. The Gracie Sls Running Free and the America and Bonita
Are on the Wind.
When tbe latter was entering port the |
Bonita put Captain Meyer aboard and
then the two vessels had a brush and the ,
Bonita had the best of the run >nto port.
Of course it must be remembered that the
Coronet was just at the end of a 113 days'
run around tbe Horn and was not in racing
trim. Then again, the Bonita has not .
been on tbe drydock for many months, so j
both vessels were in about the same con- ;
dition.
The Coronet beat the Dauntless in an |
ocean race in I*B6 and the Bonita has
beaten anything j itted apaln=t her on the i
Pacinc Coast. The yacht Lurline has held !
her own aeainst ail comers and these !
three should make one of the prettiest j
race* ever seen in Pacinc waters. The I
pilot-boat America has many friends, aad '
in any race sbe certainly would not be the ''
last boat. If a match can be arranged the
Coronet, America, Lurline and Bonita will !
probably be the contestants. In any event
the pilots are more than willing io back
their crack against the New York yacht, |
and are confident that a Pacinc Coast ves
sel can hold her own with anything pro
ducea on the Atlantic.
In speaking for the pilots yesterday all
Captain Barber would say was: "if the
owner of the Coronet will" accept a chal
iense for an ocean race we will put the Bo
nita on the drydock and at once prepare
for business. If tbe Luriine will enter the
contest we will get the America ready also,
and thus we could have a four- boat race.
The Coronet is a fast ocean racer, but I ara
willing to back my opinion that both the
Bonita and Lurline can hold their own
with her."
All three of the cracks owned by the
pilots were out yesterday. In the accom
panying cut the Gracie S (No. 3) is run
nine free with her light sails set, and the
B..nita(No. 7) and America (No. 11) are
on the wind. They were in this position
when sketched by a Call artiÂ«t yesterday.
The late Captain Charles Mathews' in
terests in the Gracie S, Bonita and
America were sold at auction yesterday in
the Merchants' Exchange. A one-eix
teenth s .are in the Gracie S brought $1375.
Another sixteenth in the Bonita brought
$1200, and the same interest in the Amer
ica went for $1175. The three sixteenths
were boujrht in by Captain Barber for the
Associated Pilots.
At the same time a one-thirty-second in
terest in the schooner William Bowen was
sold for $1125, a similar interest in the
schooner Lyman D. Foster brought $1225,
and a sixteenth interest in the schooner
R. W. Banlett brought $1750. The vessels
all brought good prices, and in thi3 way
the value of the dead master pilot's estate
was enhanced.
Cousins' drydock has changed hands,
and in future John D. Spreckels will hold
the control! ine interest. The plant will
be improved and the place will be at once
placed on a paying basis.
George Green, the pugilist, came near
losing his life yesterday. He is in train
ing for the coming Olympic Club exhibi
tion and wanted some exercise on the bay.
He went out to Long Bridge and secured
the loan of Bob McArthur's phell. When
off the sugar refinery he capsized the boai,
but managed to hang on for a while. Then i
be tried to swim ashore. He was making
little progress when a boat from the Brit
isfa ship iLllsmere went to his assistance
and picked him up.
The steamer Alameda was to have sailed
yesterday for Australia via Hawaii and ;
Samoa, but the non-arrival of the â 
English mail caused a delay. Tne pas- :
senger list is not a heavy one, but the
steamer could not take away all the freight (
that was offering. She has aboard over ;
1000 tons of Hoar and 900 tons of general ,
freight. People who were late for the mail i
were treated to a surprise. When they !
presented their stamped letters to Purser
button the latter refused to accept them,
saying that new regulations nad been estab
lished by the Custom-house and that a
regular Government envelope was neces- '
Â«ary for late letters. In consequence the j
cigar-stand owned by Henry Christensen â¢
at the bulkhead did a thriving business I
in stamped envelopes.
Tbe lirst load of fish-plates and rails for
the Santa Clara Valley Railway was ;
shipped on the schooner Carrier Dove :
yesterday. They will be unloaded at Al
viso and'the work of construction will at
once begin,

excursion was a most successful one and a
trip up the Sacramento is in contem
plation. The Lucero is in thorough work
ing order.
The ship Occidental started for the can
neries yesterday and created quite a sensa
tion. 1* he crew and cannery hands danced
a hula hula on the poop as the vessel
moved out into the stream, while their
wives and mothers cried on the wharf.
The Chinese cook left a white wife and
two children on the bulkhead waving him
a farewell.
BANES REPORTING.
Returns From Local Banking-Houses
Show Them to Be in Good
Condition.
Reports from the State banks are com
mencing to come in at the headquarters of
the Board of State Bank Commissioners.
Three times a year the board sends out
blanks, which the banking-houses are
obliged to fill out and return. In these
forms blanks are left for answers as to
each State bank's assets, liabilities and
general financial status, and the banks are
obliged to fill them out and forward them
to t c commission within two weeks. The
blanks were sent day before yesterday and
thus far only the City banks have re
sponded. To-day it is expected that re
ports from the country banks will com
mence to arrive. Thus far the retorts in
dicate that ihe banks in the vicinity of the
City are in good condition.
HE TACKLED A SHELL.
George Green, the Olympic Club Boxer,
Ha* an Experience in a Racing
Boat.
George Green, better known as Young
Corbett, the boxer of the Olympic Club ;
and member of the South End Boat Club, j
undertook to master the art of rowing ;
racing shells yesterday afternoon, and
came near ending his existence in the I
attempt.
He started from the boathouse and
pulled along admirably until he got out
into the tiue, when his frail craft became |
unmanageable and Green, losing his equi- >
librium, took a header intotu^ bay.
When his boat tipped over his feet, as
is the custom when rowing a racing shell, I
were tightly strapped to the foot rests of
the boat, which caused him to hang head
downward.
After ereat exertion he extricated him
self from hi^ perilous position, and started
to swim ashore. The tide at this time was
running like a mill race, and Green, who
is a strong swimmer, battled nobly witU
the current, but made little headway and '.
would have probably been drowned had !
it not been for a ship's boat crew, who '

fortunately saw the accident and came to
his rescue.
After returning to the boathouse with
his water-filled shell, oreen got out of his
wet garments and in an hour after was
none the worse off for his ducking.
He is by no means undaunted by the
accident and will ta<kle the frisky" shell
again if he gets ducked every day.
At the Lurline Baths.
The second entertainment of the California
Swimming and Polo Club given at the Luriine
baths last night attracted a large and ap
parently appreciative audience. In the 220
--yard championship of the Pacinc Coast, open
to all amateurs, E. Stalle won; time, 2:59 3-5.
The 100-yard dash . open to all Pacific Coast
amateurs, proved to bt tne most exciting event
ot tne evening. Dan Renear covered the dit
tance in 1 :05 3 :5, breaking the world's record
ot 1 :08 3-5, made at Chicago in 1887. In the
ten-lengths handicap, C. S. C, Stalle, winner of
the 220-yÂ«rd championship, came out ahead;
time, 3:13 2-5. Cornell, on an allowance of
nine seconds, won the four-lensrths handicap
in 1 :07 3-5, the scratch man. Renear, covering
the same distance in 1:02. The evening's en
tertainment ended with an exciting polo
match, in which the "White Caps," so called,
proved victorious.

HOME FOR AGED PEOPLE
Miss Tennant Donates a Fine
Institution at Pacific
Grove.
WILL BE A COSTLY STRUCTURE.
A San Jose Lady Who Is Giving Her
Time and Money in a Good
Cause.
The little town of Pacific Grove is about
to be beautified by a fine Home for Aged
People, which Miss Margaret Tennant, a I
San Jose lady, who now resides at the j
Grove, is having erected as a memorial to
her brother, the late John Tennant.
The building, which will be in the old !
colonial style, is surrounded by five acres of
its own land. Tie site is outside the town !
of Pacinc Grove, near the northern end of
tne seveiiteen-mile drive, and tbe ;
grounds are at present covered with pine
trace. When the building is completed it
is intended to arranee beautiful flower i
gardens around the bouse, while the re- :
mainder of the five acres will be utilized
for vegetable gardens, a miniature park
and accommodations for horses, chickens
and cows.
The building will command a beautiful
view of Monterey Bay. Work has already !
commenced, and it is expected that by the ;
early autumn this home for aged people
will he ready for occupancy. The founda
tion rests on bedrock three feet deep, and
the concrete wall rises from three to seven !
feet above the ground. The exterior will '
be of wood, while the inner walls will be ;
of the finest cement. Tbe chief archi
tectural feature will be tbe line two-story
portico, tvrenty-two feet in length by six
feet in width, with its two Corinthian !
columns and enriched cornice, support- I
ing a corresponding balcony on the second !
floor.
Tiie reception hall, which opens from :
the portico, will be twenty-two feet square ;
opposite the entrance of the hall a broad ;
open staircase will lead up to the second !
Moor. The reception hall will be used as a !
sitting-room and will be heated by a pic- ;
turesque open fireplace. Beyond "the re- I
ception-room is to be the dining-room. i
This story will also contain seven bed-
rooms, as well as kitchen, pantries and I
storerooms. The second floor will contain
eight bedrooms and the attic an equal
number.
The house is fifty feet in front by i
seventy-tive feet in depth, with two full '
stories and attic, besides a laundry and j
cold-storage room in the basement. \Vben I
finished the house will contain about i
thirty rooms and three lavatories. In the '
interior decoration light colors will pre- ',
\ail. Ivory white will be the prevailing
tint for the woodwork. The building is [
seventy-five feet from the seventeen-mile !
drive and it is destined to be the central i
one of a group at some future date.
The John Tennant Memorial Home is
to he largely directed by prominent Epis- i
coDalians.
It is under the supervision of a board of !
trustees composed of Right Rev. William |
F. Nichols, Bishop of the diocese; Rev. Dr. !
Wakefield of San Jose, Rev. C. S. Facken- j
thall of Pacific Grove and Miss Margaret
Tennant. Also a board of directors, as fol- !
lows: Richt Rev. William F. Nichols, Rev. j
C. S. Fackenthall, Mr. and Mrs. James P. '
Sargent of Monterey, Mr. and Mrs. War- j
ren K. Porter of Watsonville and Miss '
Margaret Tennant.
The endowment, after the home is com- j
pleted, will probably be about $30,000.
1 Nothing definite is settled with regard to [
rules of admission or plans for conducting
the home, but it is already known that in
coraiort and elegance it will be second to
none in the State. Miss Margaret Ten
nant, the donor, is devoting all her ener
gies to the completion of this beautiful
memorial to her brother, and it is hoped
that she will long be spared to direct the
fortunes of her home for aged people.
MILLIONAIRE M'NALLY.
The Chicago Publisher Here After a
Reat on His Olive and Lemon
Ranch.
Andrew McNally, the great publisher of
Chicago, arrived here from Southern Cali
fornia yesterday, where he has been eince
November. Mr. McNally owns a mag
nificent residence at Pasadena, and also a
fine ranch of 2300 acres at Altadena.
The ranch was purchased some five
years ago, and is devoted to growing
olives, lemons and barley. Mr. McNally
estimates that in five years more, the wav
his trees are thriving," he will produce 300
carloads of fruit a year.
He intends to make a specialty of mar-
keting ripe and pickled olive*. He i 3 en
thusiastic about California and the pro
ducts of the tree and vine. He says lie
would rather plant a tree any day than
take a big contract for printing."
Mr. MeNaliy has, by bi> investments in j
the State and by talking its advantages to I
his Illinois friends, brought many people
and a lar^e amount ot capital to Califor
nia. The firm of Rand, McNaOy <fc Co.,
which has grown and expanded with
Chicago, does a great publishing business.
They employ 700 men steadily.
TROUBLE IN COMPANY G.
; Alameda Militiamen Want Cap
tain W.F. Chipman to
Resign.
It Is Alleged That Inspecting Officers
Regard -the Captain as la*
competent.
â '$.â â 'â¢ r â  'â¢"â  "â¢â '~ ' -
There is disruption in the ranks of Ala
meda's Company G, N. G. C. The cause is
the alleged incompetency of its captain,
W. F. Cbipman, who has been in com
mand since the company's organization,
two years ago.
It was last Thursday evening that the
members discovered that they were and
had been in the hands of an incompetent
drill master, and the discovery has re
sulted in thÂ» production of a petition
which is to be presented to the captain
asking that he surrender his commission
and resign from office.^ ;
On the night in question the inspection
of the company ! took place â in Armory
Hall, and it proved to be a dismal failure.
All the members were present, and for at- ;
tendance f Company G received 100 per
cent, but !in the drill the company was
handled in such a style that the inspect
ing officers could not help making adverse
comment â in â  regard to . ; it. The ; conduct
generally, ritâ  is asserted, was palpably k
poor. . The marching, use of arms, ap
pearance of the men and everything else
was at wide variance with the correct, and
partook of a farce. ~
During the examination of arms,
accouterments, etc., on the morning fol
lowing.the inspection, Captain Chipman
received, in the presence of a number of
the members of \ his company, a rebuke
from Captain Carrington which he perhaps
did not very well like. Captain Carririgton
asked him if he bad not better get out and
do something, which was understood to
mean that Chipman was incompetent and
had not come up to expectations as an
officer.". â  '- â â â -- " â : :. ' "-:â¢ 'â  -' '" : /-
The words gave the members who heard
them the cue, and they soon had a petition
drawn up as stated above. > -
> There was ; a . business 'â â  meeting of the
company last night. The words said to
have been uttered by Captain Carrington
were denied ,by - Captain Chipman. The
latter gave his version of them, and con
strued a different meaning. He feels con
fi<ient that the members of G will stand
by him and he shows no signs of weaken
ing. ..."Â«â .: , ' ",V_ -.:.
Some of the members declared, after the
meeting, that the end is not yet and that
there will be more developments. ;
That "Fake" Footrace.
The preliminary examination of J. W. Flynn
and James Ryan, charged with grand larceny
in swindling A. H. Steil out of $1000 a week
ago by a "fake" footrace in Golden Gate Park,
was commenced before Judge Low yesterday
afternoon. Prosecuting Attorney Madden and
Attorney Peter F. Dunne appeared for the State
and Carroll Cook represented the defendants.
Three witnessesâ Duncan, Mclvor and Steilâ
were examined for the prosecution and the
case was continued till to-night. 2Â»o new facts
were elicited.
GAVE A SEALED VERDICT
The Jury Said to Have Decided
Against Warren E.
Price.
FOB SELLING INDECENT BOOKS.
On the First Ballot There Were Eleven
for Conviction â Religious
Issue Raised.
The trial of Warren E. Price on the :
charge of transmitting obscene literature!
through the United States mails was con- !
tinued before Judge Morrow in the United
States District Court yesterday. All the !
evidence was submitted and the case went ;
toÂ£the jury, but the verdict wiil not be j
known until Saturday. After being out a I
short time the jury returned for further I
instructions, and later reported that an \
agreement was improbable. Judge Mor- '
row inquired of the foreman how tiie jury
stood, and was told that the ballots showed !
eleven to one. Then he sent the jury j
back, and said that a sealed verdict could
be handed to the Marshal, in case an
agreement was reached, and the report
could be made to the court on Saturday
morning.
The jury reached a verdict just before 6
o'clock. It is thought to be against the
defendant.
The case occupied the attention of the
court during the entire day, and much in
terest was tpfcen in the proceedings. As
sistant District Attorney Slessinger ap- \
peared for the prosecution and Attorney
B. G. Haskell represented the defense. At ;
the outset the defense asked to have the
publisher! of the Report cited for con
tempt for printing certain matter reflect- ,
ing on tiie accused and tending to preju- !
dice the jury in the case. The motion, i
however, was denied by the court, and
Postal Inspector Erwin was put on the .
stand. He testified that he had learned
that Price was sending obscene literature
through the mails, and in the performance
of bis sworn duty he detected nim and
had him arrested.
From the evidence it was shown that :
Erwin sent Price a decoy letter to his book- I
store at 1203 Market street and in return '
for a money order received some spicy j
reading through the mails. The letters j
which he wrote Price and which were re- j
ceived from the latter in reply were placed
in evidence. He aamitte i having had a
conference with Frank Kane, president of
the Society for the Suppression of Vice, re- ]
garding tiie Price matter, bat declared ,
that he had no prejudice against the pris- i
oner and was solely concerned in the case !
at issue in preventing any violation of the i
postal laws.
T. J. Ford, G. S. Asmussen and W. W. |
O'Neill, postal clerks, testified to having
;-eized the books sent by Price to Erwin
wbUe in transit. Erwin had assumed the
Dame of "Schwartz" and represented him- j
self as a country dealer at C rescent City.
Mrs. M. V. Thomas, mother of the ac
cused, E. Levy, a bookseller, Clerk Miller, ,
who works for Price, and the prisoner
himself were the witnesses for the defense.
Mm Thomas swore that she assisted at'
the Market-street store, and if indecent
literature had been sold there she would
have known it. Miller and Price testified
to about the same effect. Price himself |
entered a vigorous denial against all the
charges made against him. and said that '
Kane and the Catholics had conspired to
drive him out of business because he pub- j
lished the A. P. A. Magazine. He ad
mitted having answered the letters sent by
"Schwartz," but denied that he had
mailed or caused to be mailed the obscene ;
books sent through the mails and sub- !
mitted in evidence. He testified that he
had never sold vile and indecent litera
ture to schoolgirls and children. He ad- ;
mitted that he sold "vulgar books," but, i
he added, "tney are not indecent.' '
Assistant District Attorney Slessinger
addressed the jury on behalf of the Gov
ernment.
Attorney Haskell made an eloquent plea
for the accused. "This prosecution," he i
said, "is an attempt to railroad Price to
prison on account of his religion."
Judge Morrow instructed the jury as to
the law in the case, and said that it had [
been decided by the Supreme Court of the
United States that postal inspectors were
justified in sending decoy letters to detect j
violations of the postal laws.

What You Need.
A great cry for help goes up at this time
of the year from thousands of people who
are suffering from what is sometimes
called "spring weakness." Nature re-
quires assistance and they must have help
in order to regain strength and vigor.
The best thing to take for this weak, d*-
] bilitated condition is
Duffy's Pure
Halt Whiskey
: because it builds up the system, purifies
[ the blood and stirs up the circulation. It
takes away tired, languid feelings, tones up

SUPPORTING THE
RAILROAD LEASE
Mr. Pillsbury Argues the
Implied Assent of the
Government.
JUDGE GARBER DIFFERS
He Surprises the Courtroom by
Questioning His Colleague's
Logic.
LIMIT OF CORPORATE POWER.
Creation of the Central Pacific
as a California Body Ex
clusively.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald completed
his very able argument in the railroad case
yesterday at a quarter before 1 p. m., after
which a recess was taken until 2 o'clock.
In opening his argument in the after
noon Mr. Pillsbury paid a high compli
ment to Attorney-General Fitzgerald and !
his conduct of the case on behalf of the
State. He spoke of the fairness, ability
and courtesy which characterized that
argument.
"The people of California may be con
gratulated," he said, "that they have in |
their Attorney-General a gentleman pos- j
sessing the necessary qualifications for
that high position to a degree which
makes him the equal of any one in the
United States filling that position. He
has shown in a conclusive manner that
the most earnest legal strife may go hand
In hand with the highest courtesy."
The first point in the Attorney -General's
argument taken up by Mr. Pillsbury was
the contention of the Attorney-General
that the lease of the Central Pacific and |
other roads was void because it was made !
without the consent of Congress. The
position of the speaker was that the Cen
tral Pacific is and always was a California
and not a Federal corporation. There
was nothing in the law, he argued, to pre
vent a corporation from being two sep
arate entities.
The incorporation of the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad by the legislative body of
Maryland, and afterward by that of Vir- |
ginia and by Congress, was the first theme }
discussed. In that case it was decided ;
that the railroad was a Maryland corpora- i
tion; that the laws passed by Virginia and
Congress were merely enabling acts; that
it never ceased to be a unity, and that it
exercised its authority in a foreign State I
by permission of that foreign State. It
was well settled that a corporation may
exercise its faculties in any State so far as
that State may permit. \
In the case of the Pennsylvania Rail- j
road Company against the St. Louis, I
Alton and Terre Haute Railroad Com- â 
pany it was held that the mere grant to it !
'by a State of privileges and powers would !
not transform, it into a citizen of that j
State. Congress granted to the Central
Pacific road certain rights and privileges,
but these were conferred on the company i
as a California corporation. The fact that j
it had received certain privileges from
Congress did not make it a Federal cor
poration and did not take away its char
acter as a California corporation.
Upon this point the speaker quoted a i
large number of authorities. "The gift of j
new powers," said the Supreme Court of
the United States, "to a corporation has
never been thought to destroy its identity,
much less to change it into a being. It
does not. confer corporate existence, but it
assumes corporate life already existing."
Another decision says that it is an unbend
ing rule that a grant of corporation is
never implied.
The act of Congress of Jnly 1, 1862, re
fers to the Central Pacific Railroad Com- i
pany of California as a corporation' ex- i
isting under the laws of the State of Cali- j
fornia. The act of July 2, 1364, refers to i
that company as a Californian company.
From these facts Mr. Pillsbury argued
that the Central Pacific Company had a !
right to lease its road and franchise to the j
Southern Pacific Company. The United j
States Railway Commissioner nTiiis re- i
port for 1885 said that the lease by the j
Central Pacific Railroad Company to the i
Southern Pacific of Kentucky "does' not \
affect the obligations of. the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company to the Govern- '
ment."
This lease is mentioned in the Commis- j
sioner's reports of succeeding years, and !
as these reports were forwarded to the i
Secretary of the Interior the Federal Gov- j
ernment must have been aware of the
lease.
Judge Hayne asked Mr. Pillsbury â¢
whether the act of 1864 was not a mere
enabling act and Mr. Pillsbury replied
that it purported to be such. It gave its
consent that the Central Pacific might ex- ;
ercise its powers in conformity with the
laws of the State of California. By these j
reports it was presumed, he argued, that <
Congress had knowledge of the exact situ- '
ation between the Government and the |
Central Pacific Railroad Company con
cerning the lease to the Southern Pacific
It was a recognition by Congress of the i
right of the Central Pacific to make that j
lease under the laws of the State of Cali.
fornia. The fact of this lease had been
:. directly reported to Congress.
â  Judge McKenna remarked that the Sec
retary of 4he Interior in his report to Con
gress embodied those items in his report.
Mr. Hayne asked whether the Govern
ment's having knowledge of the lease
would amount to a ratification.
Mr. Pillsbury replied that the Govern
ment imposed direct.obligations and pen
alties upon the company by the act, and
that it made it obligatory to comply with
the provisions of that act.
i "If," asked Mr. PillsUury, "the Inter
state Commerce Commission had required
anything of the Southern Pacific, could
the company say that it had not a legal
and recognized lease, and therefore could
â¢"not be required to carry out the provi
sions of that act? Certainly not. This
corporation has a right, under . the'- laws j
of the State of California, to make this i
lease, Â«nd the Government has impliedly j
given its assent, which is a recognition of I
the right to lease this road."
"Our position is," said Attorney-Gen
â¢ eral Fitzgerald, "that the general corpor
ation law is repealed." " |
Mr. .Pillsbury went on: "It is a ; well- I
settled rule that where parties having con
, tract relations carry on business under
' that contract, giving it ; a; certain con

strnction, that construction becomes I
worked into that contract, and the courts I
in such a case recognize that construction,
no matter what the original understanding
may have been. So this construction has
worked in between the parties that this
lease was legitimate and authorized and
proper under the original contract rela
tions as established. There is nothing
which would prevent the implied assent of
Congress under that act that this lessee
should carry on that road."
"Don't the United States authorities all
hold that corporate rights must be ex
pressed?" asked the Attorney-General.
"Yes," was the reply, 'giving corporate
rights."
"There is no such thing as an implied
power," continued the Attorney-General, i
"in addition to those incorporated in the
charter."
"I say that the assent of Congress may i
be implied." said Mr. Pillsbury.
"Don't all authorities hold that the as- :
sent of Congress must be expressed and
cannot be implied?" inquired the Attor- |
ney-General.
"As to the contract relations which ex- \
isted between the Government and the i
Southern Pacific of Kentucky growing out j
of this lease," proceeded Mr. Pillsbury, '
"they were such that the United States |
has recognized these contract relations
i and implied assent that they were not in
violation of any of its rights in the case of
. the Union Pacific."
Here the court announced that he would
[ continue the hearing of the argument un- '
j til next Tuesday morning at 11 o'clock, to-
I day Deing Good Friday.
Judge Garber, of counsel for the railroad
! company, astonished the courtroom at
â  this juncture by remarking as a matter of
j courtesy that he did not agree to the doc
trine of implied assent as advocated by
Mr. Pillsbury. He would argue that prop
osition, he said, when his turn came to
i address the court.
"Which of them are we to take, Judge ;
i Garber or Mr. Pillsbury?" inquired Judge :
Hayne with a comical "air.
The court was here adjourned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 1896.
SHE FOLLOWS HER AUNT
Lisle Leigh's Adopted Mother
Was Popular at the Old
California.
The New Leading Lady at the Grand
Went on the Stage When
Four Years Old.
Miss Lisle Leigh, the new leading lady
at the Grand, promises to become as !
popular with San Francisco audiences as '
her aunt was before her.
Old Californians remember Sara Alex
ander, Miss Lisle Leigh's aunt, weil. j
When almost a child she was a member J
of Brigham Young's stock company at
the Salt Lake Theater, and by her singing '
and dancing so won the good graces of the '
old Mormon that lie had her brought up ,
with his own children, and frequently <,
alluded to her as his eleventh daughter.
Miss Sara Alexander had a will of her j
own. She refused to allow herself to be I
married to any of Brigrham Young's fol- I
lowers, and when she chose to leave the
Salt Lake company she did so, in spite of
the protests of the saints, who were very i
loth to lose their favorite comedienne. '
Sara Alexander came to California from ;
Bait Lake, and at the old California
Theater ingratiated herself as much into
the good will of San Francisco audiences ;
as she had formerly captured the regard !
ot the Saints.
Lisle Leigh came on the scene of life at a
later date. She was born in Salt Lake, and .
as her mother died a year or two later her
aunt, Sara Alexander, adopted her. At 4 j
years old littie Lisle made her staize debnt i
at Louisville in the role of Aliie with F. I
S. Cbanfrau In â  "Kit, or the Arkansas
Traveler." Since that time she has played i
almost continuously, sometimes in "the i
companies of which" her aunt was a mem- ;
her and sometimes taking the child roles !
for leading dramatic stars. At 15 she j
began tn play emotional roles as a woman. |
sliss Lisle Leigh can say with truth that
in her time she has played many parts, i
for although only about 20 years of age
she has appeared in over a hundred differ
ent roles. Her last tour was with "North
ern Lights." She created her role in that
drama in Brooklyn last October, and con- â 
tinued all through the tour, which ended !
in Brooklyn on the 21st of last month.
Two days later she was on her way to Cali- |
fornia with her aunt, Sara Alexander, who j
always accompanies her on her travels,
j and at once began rehearsing at the Grand.
"It was quick work," said Miss Leigh
yesterday, "but I am so used to going from
one engagement to another that the habit
has become second nature. Ever since i
; can remember anything I have always
been on the stage, except for six months, '
; when 1 was in the betwixt-and-between
! stage, neither a child nor a woman, but
during that time I was making occasional
appearances."
Misa Leigh is a tall, well-developed girl,
i whose growth has certainly not been re
tarded by her precocious stage appear
, ances, though she looks a little more than
her 20 years. She has a very quiet, mod
est manner and relies largely on her aunt
in all the business of lire." The young
; actress has an especial liking for emo
| tional roles and is looking forward with in
! terest to the experience which six months'
; work with a stock company will give her.
The last time she was here was with tte
j Potter-Bellew company at the Baldwin.
Violated the Postal Lawi.
A young man named Josselyn, son of Dr.
Josselyn ol 1812 Market street, was arrested
by Postal Inspector Erwin yesterday for vio
lating the United States postal laws. It up
pears the aroused received a letter sent by
Mrs. Mary Plmenlat of San Jose to a physician
at the address where he lived. He opened the
letter, and, learning its contents.he opened up
a correspondence with the woman, represent
ing himself as the physician whom she ad
dressed. In this way he obtained a sum of
money from her for medicine which he sent
her. He was released on $1000 bonds.
TICKET AGENTS AROUSED
Inclined to Rebel Against the
Rulings of Chairman
Caldwell.
THERE MAT BE A DISRUPTION
An Attempt to Prevent the Payment
of Commissions the Cause of
the Trouble.
Serious trouble is brewing for the West
ern Passenger Association lines, and all on
account of what is denounced by the local
ticket agents as the arbitrary action of
Chairman B. D. Caldwell of the associa
tion.
Not long ago he made a ruling that
through tickets in blank Bhould not be fur
nished to local agents of intermediate
lines by the initial lines â in the case of
this City these being the Southern Pacific,
the Santa Fe and the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company. According to this
ruling the agents of connecting lines
should take passengers who desire to pur
chase tickets ov r their lines to the office
of one or the other of these initial lines
and there have him sign his ticket. But
this ruling is violated by every local pas
senger agent, all of whom carry a stock of
Southf-rn Pacific tickets in blank to save
their patrons the inconvenience of going
to the office of the initial line.
Within the past week, however, Chair
man Caldwell has taken another fling at
the local agents, and this one is viewed
with much stronger dissatisfaction, as it is
more likely to affect the business of their
respective roads on the one hand and their
individual incomes on the other. This
latest ruling prohibits any but coupon or
initial line ticket offices from paying com
missions to agents of other lines. This
ruling was announced to take effect on
April 1, but it is being ignored by all the
agents, and they declare that they will
continue to ignore it, as there is nothing
in the agreement between the roads of the
Western Passenger Association to warrant
the objectionable ruling.
It is expected that the failure of the local
men to conform to the dictates of Chair
man Caldwell will soon be brought to the
attention of the latter gentleman, but
what he will be able to do to enforce his
orders is not known. There is no penalty
provided for in these cases and the only
course for Chairman Caldwell to pursue is
to call on the heads of the various roads to
see that his rulings are recognized and
obeyed. Should they fail to do so a dis
integration of the association is not an
impossibility.
STUDENTS ENTERTAINED
An Enjoyable and Instructive Hour in
the Lincoln Kvening
School.
The assembly ball of the Lincoln even
ing school, near the corner of Fifth and
Market streets, was filled with the senior
classes last evening, assembled to listen
to Assistant Professor C. C. Plehn of the
department of history of the University of
California.
The students were highly entertained
and instructed, the subject being "The
Time of Washington Contrasted With the
Present." City Superintendent Madison
Babcock followed, and reminded the classes
that better preparation for the battle of
life was expected of them than the young
people of the earlier yeriod could possibly
have had. The principal, A. H. Mac Do
nald, then had the "Salute to the flag"
given in the impressive manner peculiar
to the "Lincoln evening." The hour
closed with "America."
Dr. E. P. Lewis, a distinguished instruc
tor, recently from the East, but now suc
ceeding the late Professor Harold Whit
ing in the department of physics, Berke
ley, opened this extension course on
March 12. Instructors Armes and Syle
will follow on successive alternate Thurs
day evenings. This is the largest evening
school in the United States; it has about
thirty classes.
JOHN McCALLAN, WHO TELLS SOME OF THE URGENT NEEDS OF EUREKA.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
DOWN FROM HUMBOLDT.
John McCallan on Portland's
Attempt to Get Eureka's
Trade.
Terminal Rates on Freights Demanded
Above All Things â Donahue
Road and Lumber.
John McCallan, a prominent financial i
and business man of Eureka, Humboldt I
County, is at the Grand. In speaking !
about this part of California Mr. McCai- |
lan, who is a young, active aiid enterpris- j
ing man, says Humboldt has suffered j
probably more than any other count}' in >
I the State from the peculiarity of its loca- j
I tion. Its position with regard to the more ;
[ thickly settled portions of California is !
one of almost complete isolation, practi
cally the only means of ingress or egress
being by steamer from San Francisco.
"The terrors of a voyage to Humboldt 'â¢
have usually been painted in very lurid ;
colors," said he, "and, indeed, if the truth j
must be told it is very often a nasty trip, â¢
which will try the heart of the bravest !
and the stomach of the toughest. I have :
seen men who considered themselves ;
quite brave turn pale with fright when told ;
that the steamer was heading for Hum- j
! boldt Bar. In reality there is not the :
| slightest danger in crossing the oar in tue â 
: carefully navigated steamers plying be- :
| tween San Francisco and Eureka. Since :
. the Government has been improving the i
' harbor vessels of deep draught can enter i
port any time, wlieu in former years they '
I would be detained at sea awaiting tides; ;
| so that the improvements to our harbor
have been a grand success.
"Here let me state that Hon. T. J. Geary
of Santa Rosa i 3 entitled to the credit of ,
making Humboldt Harbor what it is, and
had they sent him back to Congress ho j
j would have secured another appropriation .
that would have dredged the bay in ac- j
cordance with its needs.
"Northern California has never been j
boomed and is undeveloped. The boomer i
and climate-vender and manufacturer of !
| roseate pictures have not so far exploited i
this northern coast settlement as they
I have those of the south, yet the products
are among the best and richest in the
State. Even the most esthetic lover of
flowers and climate must eat occasionally,
and if he knows what is good for him he
will not fail to use some of Humboldt's
choice butter.
"Portland is reaching out for business
along the northern coast, and has extended
its trade as far south as Eureka. Portland I
merchants, I am reliably informed, have !
been shipping large amounts of flour,
grain and similar merchandise to our
people. A leading merchant told me he
saved 25 cents per barrel on flour. Our
people, as a matter of course, are more
triendl}' to San Francisco, the Portland
people being strangers to us.
"While in my opinion there is no imme
diate danger of San Francisco Josing this
luree trade, yet the main point at issue
with us is to provoke competition be
tween the transportation companies so as |
to secure terminal rates from Humboldt
Bay to inland and Eastern markets. The
lumber merchants cannot afford to ship
their products to the East because of the
high rates of transportation. We must i
have terminal rates either by way of Port
land or San Francisco. The "direction
from which these rates comes will of
course secure our trade.
"A transcontinental railway with a
Western terminus at Eureka would bring
about the same result we are now working
for. I have every reason to believe that
ths Donahue line, from this City to Ukiah,
will be extended north at an "early date.
It would open up a rich country and the
country would soon be populated with
thousands of homes.
"The mail service by steamship is good,
but by land it is bad. Thb Call by the
overland mail reaches us at any time
within one month after it leaves the
press. Ihe Pacific Coast. Steamship Com
pany gives us excellent transportation
accommodation; the magnificent steamre
Pomona makes the run in seventeen

AMID SPRING BLOSSOMS
Nuptials of Migs Millie Greenebauin
and Dr. Herbert Hatch at the Resi
dence of the Bride.
Miss Millie Greenebaum and Dr. Her
bert Hatch were married yesterday after
noon at 4 o'clock at the residence of the
bride's parents on Van Ness avenue.
The fair bride of yesterday has for tbe
past few seasons enjoyed the privileges
and attentions accorded a popular belle,
and her charming disposition and rare tart
liave made her hosts of friends, $he is
possessed of artistic ability and has the
happy knack of adding grace and beauty
to all her surroundings. She is the daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs, J. Greenebaum and
the niece of Louis Slo?sand Lewis Gerstle.
Dr. Hatch, the happy groom, is the sou
of Dr. J. H. Hatch. He is a young physi
cian who has his career before him.
The Greenebaum residence was prettily
decorated for the occasion with a profusion
of sprinti blossoms. Vases and bowis filled
with fragrant roses and vioiets were dis
tributed in the various apartments on the
ground floor. In the drawing room a piece
of white net, studded with apple and pear
blossoms, spanned the bay-window, and
here the happy couple stood while Dr.
Voor. c anger performed the wedding ser
vice.
The bride wore a modish tailor gown of
cadet blue broadcloth, with little toque to
match. She was attended by her sisters,
the Sli.Hses Alice and Florence Greenebaum,
who officiated as bridesmaids and were aT
tired in dainty gowns of blue and white
organdies.
Howard Morrow was best man and M.
C. Sloss, Louis Greenebaum, William Ger
stle and S. I. Stone officiated as ushers.
After the ceremony an informal recep
tion was held, at which about 150 guests
were present.
Dr. and Mrs. Hatch left by last evening's
overland for a northern bridal tour, after
which they will return for a short stay in
this City, previous to going to their luture
home at Jackson, A.mador County.
IN FAIRMOUNT DISTRICT
The Residents Have Not Been
Forgotten by the Su
pervisors.
The Fairmount district has not been
neglected in the line of improvements.
Although an outside section it has made
considerable headway in building up hand- j
some and comfortable dwellings, churches !
and a schoolnouse.
A handsome steel bridge has just been
finished over the railroad crossing at the
junction of Charles and Arlington streets,
at a cost of JBSOO. This with a level cross
ing on the line of the railroad at Randall
street and Cortland avenue will give to the
people on both the north and south Â«lope
of Mission hill a safe and acceptable drive
way without the necessity of climbing
round the slope of the hiljside.
This $8500 bridge is not, however, the
only mark of progress going on in the
Fairmont district. The Spring Valley i
Water Company has about finished laying
a 36-inch pipe from Lake Merced to
Silver avenue heights on the east side of
Mi?sion street to its reservoir on Mission
Hill. In order to house the additional
storage of water this company is building
I a reservoir alongside the one already
located there. To cross the railroad track
the company had to build a bridge for the
main one block north of where the Bteel
bridge is located. But the water com
j pany's structure is wooden, and it dia not
' coat much.

went forth from that body last night after
B long debate that lasted well nigh to the
midnight hour.
To-day the grievance committee, acting
as an arbitration body with the business
agents of the council, will call upon the
manager of the Parrott estate and the
superintendent of the Parrott building
and demand that the imion's working
card be recognized by trie discharge of a
force of non-union workmen, providing
the latter decline to enter the unions of
their respective callings.
If the workmen will not send in their
applications for membership and the man
agement and contractors will not discharge
the non-union men, the union carpenters,
giaziers, painters, woodworkers, finishers,
cornice-workers, etc., will be called out.
The job will be "struck" from the base- i
Jiient to the roof and from Market street
through to Jessie street. It will be one of
the largest "tie-ups" the City has ever
experienced.
The trouble is all over the working-card
Of the allied building trades' unions.
Under the card system no union man is
permitted to worK on a piece of work with
a non-union man. Many weeks ago the
uniqns decided to protect themselves and
' the wages of their members by the
adoption of the system, because it has
proved a success in many of the Eastern
cities.
Notice was sent to all union men and to
all building trade" contractors that it ]
would be put into operation on April 1. I
Before that date the members of the
Painters' and Decorators' Union went out i
on a strike for $3 a day of eight hours, and i
a recoenition of the card system. Their '
fisht continued with more or less success i
until April 1, when they expected the
promised support of the entire building
trades.
Efforts were made on the Ist and yester
day by the grievance committee of the
council to effect a settlement between the
etriking painters and the employing
painters. Their efforts were successful in!
the case of J. St. Denis it Co., who have
the painting contract upon the Parrott
luildmg.
No sooner was this arranged than P. W.
Kuss, one of the most bitter enemies of
the union and a member of the Master
Painters' Association, was found to have a
tub-contract and a gang of non-union
painters ana polishers in the Parrott
building. The union painters were not
desirous of going to work with the non
union men. A little later it developed
that the Pan Francisco Furniture Com
pany had some kind of a sub-contract and
liad a small force of non-union workmen
at work in the building.
Thus the interest of the allied trades
â unions was centered upon the big stone
emporium. The business agents or walk
ing delegates for the council, H. M. Saun
ders and R. T. Mclvor.were taken to task by
many union painters for not calling out
the union workmen on Wednesday or
yesterday, but they had not received the
authority of the council to do so, and they
declined to take upon themselves such a
responsibility.
Last night at the meeting of the Coun
cil the agents made tneir reports and
asked for instruction as to future action.
This opened the question, which was ar
gued for several hours and resulted as
ptated.
The result of to-day's conference be
tween the management of the Parrott es
tate and the representatives of the council
will be reported to the council to-night,
for a special meeting of that body has been
called for a further discussion and consid
eration of the situation.
Delegate Rose of the painters stated that
at the morning meeting of his union he
had been instructed to demand an explan
ation why the working card had not been
put into operation. He paid the obliga
tion the several unions entered into would
not be maintained unless the union men
ceased working on Jobs where non-union
men were at work. He was instructed to
protest against further delay in the
matter.
Then followed a iong discussion, the
conservative element arguing in favor of
using all possible measures to settle this
trouble without a strike.
The delegate from the glaziers said that
laborers are being employed in putting in
the large glass plates. Another stated
that the Parrott estate management in tc
a great extent responsible for the compli
cations in the sub-contracting business.
Others thought that it was an oversight
in not giving the business agents execu
tive powers at first.
Agent Mclvor at last stated the situa
tion by saying:
We are losing time by all ttali talk. The
question is, "Is the building trades working
card in operation, or is it not ?" It is either *
mÂ«e of tie-up or retreat without even facing
the enemy. We do not care to face thin uncer
tainty any longer. We want our Instructions
here and now. What applies to the I'arrott i
building applies to a large number of job* in j
he City where "scabs" are at work with union '
men.
It waÂ« proposed that an attempt be
made to arbitrate on all jobs in the City!
before calling t]Ue men out.
At last another delegate went to the I
front and said :
There is but one thing ior us as a council j
to do, and that is to act upon the suggestions
o{ both sides. We came here from our unions
instructed to maintain the working-card
system.
The public and the contractors are familiar
with our demands. We do not desire to be
hasty, but we must act with decision.
I make a motion that we send our grievance
committee and business agents to the manage
ment of the Parrott estate and endeavor
to secure a settlement by arbitration. ;if
they cannot agree, instruct the business agents
to cull out every union workman affiliated with
this council. Let this order apply to every job
in the City. Let us, however, direct our at
tention to the largest job first and conquer
that first
Settle by arbitration if you can, but if you
cannot strike the Parrott job before night.
After a little further discussion the last
suggestion prevailed.
It is possible that the job may be struck
before the afternoon is passed, as the
grievance committee and the business
agents were given that power and re
ceived their commissions as aeents for the
council.
This makes the painters' strike a side
issue although those craftsmen being on
strike will again come prominently to the
front. The attitude of the Master Paint
ers' Association in declaring open hostil
ity to the working card will bring the
members of that body into the thick of
the tight sooner or later, and not until
then wili the journeymen painters appear
prominently.
This strike was not entered into hastily
and without great deliberation on the part
of those who are interested in trade-union
matters. However, no one has attempted
to act without the authority of his union
and his fellow-delegates. In this they
hope and anticipate a victory sooner or
J later, because they have acted only upon
i the wishes and demands of the whole.
T. MACAULEY SPEAKS.
J. St. Denis & Co. State That They
Will Not Betray the Unton's
Confidence.
The firm of J. St. Denis & Co. has de
â¢ lined its position with reference to the
I Building Trades Council and the Painters'
! Union. At the meeting of the Master
i Painters' Association a certain member of
I that body stated that St. Denis & Co. were
! obliged to concede to the union's demands
in order to finish certain work that had to
: be done, and that after this work was rin
i ished the firm would cast aside its agrce
i ment with the union men. In other
I words, that J. St. Denis and his partner,
j T. Maoauley, made an agreement or con
j trait that thay had no intention of living
; up to longer than was absolutely necessary
i or suits their convenience.
Mr. St. Denis and Mr. Macauley are not
pleased that their sincerity should be
I questioned by the members of the Master
Painters' Association or anyone else. Mr.
Macauley In substance said* of the matter:
The statement that the firm of J. St. Denis &
Co. made an agreement with the union people
that we do not intend to live up to or was not
I iv good faith, is unauthorized and unwar
j ranted. We. as business men, have as much
j regard for our word of honor as any one else.
I We agreed with the representatives of the
building Trades Council to unionize our shop,
recognize the working-card system and pay #3
for eierht hours' work. We will live up toour
agreement with them as long as they keep
faith with us.
If we find thiit the contract is not fulfilled,
that union painters are working for
other boss painters for less than we agree
to pay and will pay, we will lay the matter be
fore the Building Trades Council and ass to tie
released from the agreement. It cannot be ex
pected that we will jay our union men sÂ£3 a
j day for eight hours' work when all of the other
; contractors are paying less than that rate.
: Should the union painters break from their
I agreement with us they cannot expect that we
! can compete with other contractors on such
1 unequal conditions. As a iact we made our
, compact with the representatives of the Build
ing Trades Council and it will be witn them
| that we will deal should any controversy arise.
Let it be well understood we made the ngree
; ment, which is duly signed, in good faith and
! we will keep it as long as the other parties
) keep faith with us. All statements to the con-
I trary are unwarranted and unjustifiable.
J. M. Saunders and J. McCartney of the
: Building Trades Council stated that this
position was fair and that no union man
should ask for more.
MASTER PAINTERS' PLEDGE.
Will Show Their Strength as Soon
as the List Is Com
plete.
E. H. Black, president of the Master
Painters' Association, stated yesterday
that the members of that organization
have no intention of retreating from the
position taken a month ago and renewed
at the meeting held on Wednesday even
ing. It is the purpose of the body to fight
the card system to the bilter end, and not
to recognize the Painters' Union. He
said :
We have been greatly annoyed by the strik
ing painters claiming that certain of our mem
bers' shops hud been unionized, and that the
owners thereof had given in to the union's de
mands. Tney announced a list of the alleged
union shops, and many of the proprietorKcame
at once to me to deny that they had given in
to anything. Now that the union men and
the public may not be deceived we have de
cided to publish a list of those who have
signed a pledge not to give in or unionize
tneir shops. That will Bottle thiÃ matter.
All who were present at the meeting Wednes
day evening signed the agreement, and we ap
pointed a committee to see the members of our
association who were not present ho they could
sign. We are not asking the master painters
to sign this. We will cause this list to be pub
lished as soon as it is completed.
A DARING BURGLAR.
He Breaks Into the Residence of Police
man Charleston on Fulton
Street.
It is seldom that burglars are daring
enough to pay their attentions to the resi
dence of a policeman, but such a case was
reported at police headquarters yesterday.
Policeman John B. Charleston lives at
15 Fulton street. He reported off duty at
6 o'clock Wednesday night, and, as he had
to report on again at midnight, he lay
down to sleep after eating his supper.
While he was asleep a burglar forced
open one of the rear windows with a
"jimmy" and crawled through it. He
cautiously made his way to where Charles
ton was asleep and secured three gold
watches. Then he carried â  Charleston's
uniform away with him and searched the
pockets thoroughly in the yard. He only
found a dollar, which must have grieved
him greatly, as Charleston received his
month's pay on Wednesday.
The uniform was left in the yard, where
Charleston was gratified to find it after a
vain search through the house. He found
his star in the kitchen, where the burglar
had evidently dropped it.
Charleston would like to be specially
detailed to find the burglar, as he feels
very sore at his impudence.
JACK MARTIN DYING.
He Took it Sudden Turn for the Worse
Karly This Morning.
John F. Martin, the Deputy County
Clerk, who was shot in the corridor of the
City Hail by his wife lust Monday, was re
ported at 2 o'clock this morning to be
dying.
About 10 o'clock last night he betran to
rapidly grow weaK, and his physicians
saw that he could live but a few hours
longer. His friends were notified and all
preparations have been made for the end.
Tim Robbers Arrested.!
Jerry Jones and Henry Jacobs", both colored
men, were arrested last night by Detective
Dillon and Officer Young, on complaint of an
other colored man named Lenord Roach. He
states that Wednesday night he was enticed
into a Keamy-strcct resort by Jones and Jacobs
and made drunk. Then they with a white
man loaded him into a milk wagon and took
him out to the Western Addition, when they
rubbed him oi a gold watch and $2 in coin.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 1896.
THERE WAS BUT
ONE MOURNER
H. 0. Deuss at the Funeral
of His Wife and Three
Children.
THOUSANDS ATTENDED.
A Curious Mob Turn the Lugu
brious Occasion luto a
Holiday.
THREE LITTLE WHITE COFFINS.
The Victims of the Recent Dreadful
Tragedy Will Be Cremated
Next Week.
There was but one actual mourner yes
terday afternoon at the funeral of Mrs.
Olga Deuss and her three asphyxiated
babies.
There were nearly ten thousand people
in attendance at and about the Suhr un
dertaking establishment and half that
number about the public receiving vault
in Odd Fellows' Cemetery, where the four
victims of the late tragedy were received
to await the crematory process next week,
but they were not mourners in the sad,
sentimental sense.
H. O. Deuss, the husband and father,
who, returning home last Tuesday morn
ing a few hours after kissing his wife and
babies a fond good-by, found them all in
the cold embrace of death, was alone,
broken down in his sorrow and aged a
score of years since his sad bereavement.
All the other people, or at least the great
majority of those crowded about the dead
ones, were there out of absolute morbid
curiosity. "Women predominated. They
arrived as early as (i:3O in the morning,
before the mother and children were
placed in their coffins. Some came with
their lunches tucked under their wraps
and others cruelly kept their infant babies
in the house of the dead, in the heavy
sultry air, laden with the sickly perfume
of flowers and the fetid smell of an over-
I crowded apartment, until the corpses were
removed to the hearses, and everything
j being over, there was nothing more to see.
Sergeant Conboy, who had been de
tailea by Chief Crowley to take charge of
the crowd, had Policemen Burke, H. H.
Murphy, John O'Connor and Owen Gor
man to assist him. He and his men, when
it was all over, declared that never before
had they encountered such an unreason
able mass of people. Well dressed and
apparently respectable women pushed and
shoved, fought, scratched, pulled hair and
even swore in their efforts to crowd thou
sands into two rooms which, at best, could
accommodate but one hundred living peo
ple and tne four dead.
The funeral had been advertised for 2
o'clock in the afternoon. At noontime
there were 2000 people lighting their way
into the establishment. Au hour later the
housetops all along Mission street between
Eighth and Ninth were black with hu
manity. Windows in the different houses
and room on the stairways leading to the
street were at a premium. The sidewalks
no longer could be discerned and the
seething mass, jocular here and quarrel
some there, tilled the street and impeded
the progress of the electric cars.
It was a grand holiday for this crowd of
people, but inside, where his four loved
ones rested In their coffins, one man's
heart was racking with pain.
He, 11. O. Deuss, the poor husband and
father, was the only mourner, and it is a
sad commentary on the crowds of people
who suffered simple inconvenience through
their own massing that they could not
wait until the real picnic season for their
outing.
Mrs. Olga Deuss occupied a black casket
in the center of the main parlor. At her
feet was the tiny white coffin of little Carl,
her 30-months-old boy. jGretchen, the
child whose eighth birthday would have
been yesterday, reposed in another white
coffin to the right of her mother, while
her sister, little Fredda, only b% yean
I old, was to the left.
Flowers? They were everywhere. Large
set pieces sent by various and numerous
fraternal lodees in which the heart-broken
Mr. Deuss is interested. There were small
pieces and cut flowers in profuion.
A lew moments before 2 o'clock the
police drove back the crowd on the side
walk in front of the undertaking estab
lishment. The people did not take well
to thiÂ«, ana many narsh and unseemly
words were cast back at the officers. But
they had to do it. Mr. Deuss, the only
representative of his family, had been
driven up in a carriage and a passageway
had to be made for him to his darlings.
He was accompanied by his friends,
Frederick Hauser, W. Oerichten and H.
F. Fricke, who supported him physically
as well as morally in his affliction.
It was found necessary to drive out some
of the curiously inclined to make room for
the new arrival and to furnish space in
which the simple funeral ceremony was
to be held.
President Gustav Liebold of the German
Independent Congregation made a brief
address in German prior to the caskets
being carried to the hearses. He opened
by deprecating the poorness of language
that makes it impossible to wordpaint the
magnitude of sorrow caused by an occur
rence such as had happened to darken the
life of his friend, H. O. Deuss.
"The unhappy husband and father,"
continued the speaker, "went along
through life and tasted the joys of a happy
home to be found in a good wife and
lovely babies. Suddenly, like the awaken
ing from a pleasant dream to the hard
realities of life, he was called upon to
stand the most dreadful calamity that
has befallen any man in many years. Let
us hope that he will meet and bear with it
in fortitude."
i The closing of the address was quite
touching, causing nearly all the women in
the room to break out in tears, while the
unfortunate father sobbed out aloud. The
speaker compared the Deuss family to a
beautiful rosebush with a full-blown rose
and three little buds. While in the height
of their beauty and fragrance a terrific
storm swept down upon them, blighting
their lives and only leaving behind the old
stalk to mourn alone for its ones that
were lost.
At the close of the addresÃ the coffins
were carried to the two hearses. Mrs.
Deuss and Gretchen were placed in a black
hearse and Fredda and Carl were put in a
white one.
The pallbearers were John Hauser.
Charles Adams, Henry Bach and Joseph
Stroecgen, representing the Mission Turn
Verein, and P. Gfeil and C. Hahn, repre
senting Mission Lodge of Hermann's Son*.
The funeral cortege reached Masonic
Cemetery at 3:30 o'clock. Already thou
sands of people had gathered there.
Among them were hundreds of school
children with their books and slates cor
rectly strapped and slung over their
shoulders. They, like the grown people,
were interested in the interment. To their
credit it may be said they behaved in a
becoming manner. Their tender hearts
seemed to go out to the little ones in the
white coffins, and many an armsleeve, in
lieu of a handkerchief, wiped away a tear.
Emil Leiss, the German philosopher
who is the head of the Free-thinkers'
church in this City, delivered a short ad
dress. He was quite ill, and left his bed for
the ceremony contrary to the advice of his
physician. The address was in German
and much on the same lines as that deliv
ered earlier in the day by Gustay Liebold.
HANDLED HER OWN CASE
Mrs. Cunningham â¢ Gibbons -La
Cere in the Justice
Court.
WAS AS COOL AS A VETERAN.
She Instructed a Witness to State
Facts and Not Tell His
Thoughts.
Alice Cunninghamâ petite, dark-eyed
and pretty â whom a complaint recently
filed in the Justice Courts allegeÃ to also
bear the names of Laura Gibbons and
Laura La Cere, conducted her own case
before Jubtice Barry yesterday and did it
with tne assurance and ingenuity of an ex
perienced practitioner.
Mrs. Cunningham-Gibbons-La Cere en
tered into a partnership with Mrs. Alice
Quinn in a candy factory at .Berkeley, the
latter putting in and the former the
experience. Merely as a matter of form â
Mrs. Cunningham claimsâ she gave Mrs.
Quinn a note for the $150 advanced with
the understanding that it was given to
protect her from tier husband from whom
she was getting a divorce, and that if the
business did not succeed Mrs. Quinn was
to stand the loss of that amount. Shortly
after the partnership was entered into
Mrs. Quinn became tired of life in a
candy factory and the business was dis
solved. Then the partnership was sud
denly dissolved too, and Mr 9. Quinn be
gan suit on the note.
When the case was called up yesterday
Mrs. Cunningham told Judge Barry that
she was not able to hire, an attorney, and
requested that she be allowed to handle
her own case, to which the Justice* gra
ciously assented.
When Mrs. Quinn was called to the stand
to testify regarding the notp and the man
ner in which it was made Mrs. Cunning
ham assumed a dramatic attitude before
her and propounded question after ques
tion in a manner that seemed to annoy
Mrs. Quinn greatly. Her answers grew
sharp and Mrs. Cunningham exclaimed:
"Mrs. Qinnn, remember that you are a
witness in this case, and that you can't
play hot and cold. Answer yes or no to
what I ask you."
When she had finished with Mrs. Qninn
she called k\ A. Sademan, who had acted
as a salesman for the factory and who had
drawn up the note on which the suit was
based. Sademan, under her searching in
terrogatory, began to testify that he
thought that the instrument was made un
der the conditions indicated by the ques
tions.
"Never mind what you think," said the
new legal light, "this is not a place to
think ; it is a court of law, and you are ex
pected to testify to facts as you know
them. Give us facts and don't indulge in
hypothesis."
Sademan became even more confused
under her crossfire, and she seemed to en
joy his evident embarrassment as com
pletely as any veteran of the bar.
When she took the stand to testify on
her own behalf Mrs. Cunningham stated
that La Cere was her maiden name, Gib
bons her married name and Cunningham
the name under which she chose to con*
duct a candy factory. She denied owing
Mrs. Quinn anything on the note and pro
duced her books to show that the expenses
of the business had eaten up the money
Mrs. Quinn had put in.
She parried all etferts to lead her into
damaging admissions as skillfully as she
had acted the part of questioner, and left a
favorable impression on the Justice as well
as those who listened to her efforts. The
case was taken under advisement.
Wagner was a highly practical feeder.
He ate very fait, placing his food in his
mouth and gulping it down while he
talked.

WANT CLEAN STREETS.
The Merchants' Association Holds
Two Important Meet
ings.
CONTRACTORS ARE PRESENT.
San Francisco Compared With Other
Cities in the Matter of Street-
Sprinkling.
A good-sized crowd gathered yesterday
afternoon in the assembly hall of the
Mills building at the meeting called by
tbe Merchants' Association for the pur
pose of considering, the street-sprinkling
question. . ; .
Mr. Kohlberg by way of introduction
etated that when the Merchants' Associa
tion began the agitation in favor of clean
streets the subject of street-sprinkling was
also considered, and was made part of ' its
scheme of reform. He asked for expres
sions of opinion on the matter under con
sideration, and said all the association de
sired was a friendly understanding among
all parties interested to the end that some
good might be accomplished.
A general discussion then ensued, dur
ing which it was suggested that the
sprinkling of streets and the sweeping or
lighting was a municipal function and
should be under the charge of the City;
that the laying of dust being a benefit en
joyed by the whole community, the ex
pense attendant upon that benefit should
be borne by all in just proportion.
Mr. Freud made the following state
ment, based upon statistics in his posses
sion:
For the purpose of sprinkling the city of St.
Louie systematically and uniformly the city is
divided into fifty-four, districts, each district
being let separately by contract in February
of each year. There, is a sprinkling superin
tendent, a clerk and twenty-three inspectors,
whose services are paid for by the city. The
season opens March 15 and closes December 1
of each year, a period of eight and a half
months. "The cost last year averaged about
2' 3 cents per front foot.
The street-sprinkling of St. Paul is done by
contract, the city being divided into districts
and a' separate contract let for each district at
so much per 100 feet per week., The average
price this year was from 22 to 23 cents per
100 feet a week. Very good . results have been
obtained from this system.
The sprinkling of the streets of Minneapolis
is done under the direction of the Street Com
missioners and Aldermen of each ward. An
assessment is levied each year upon all asses
si ble property abutting, on the. streets sprin
kled, at a uniform rate per front foot in each
ward. The city furnishes the water free. Num
ber of sprinkling-carts used in 1894 reached
152.- â¢ .
The city of Boston is uniformly and system
atically sprinkled by the city authorities.
From a tiible published in the municipal re
ports of the city ot Boston giving the amounts
expended in t-treei sprinkling for the past
seventeen years it appears that the amount
has run from Â£23,595- in -1S~!> to Â£37,169 in
1894. During the years 1891-92-93 the amount
has averaged very nearly Â£100,000 per annum, :
In 1891 it reached Â£104,000 as the amount ex
pended, by the city for street-sprinkling.
Uniform and regular sprinkling of the pub
lic streets by the city has been adopted in
â¢nearly all progressive Eastern cities, such as
Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Cambridge, Turling
ton and in the Western cities of Salt Lake and
Omaha.
. The municipality sprinkles the streets in I
â  every progressive city in California, such as
Oakland, Sacramento, San, Jose, Fresno, Santa
Cruz and Alameda.
The street-sprinkling of Los Angeles is let
â  by .contract, the contractor receiving $3040
, per month. There are ' now seventy-five
sprinkling carts doing the work, but the city
of Los Angeles is already increasing this num
ber, so that there will shortly be 100 sprink
ling carts doing the work of sprinkling the
streets of the city of Los Angeles. There are
, 140 miles of graded streets to sprinkle. Some
' are sprinkled twice a day and some only three
times a week according to the condition of the
streets and the amount of travel. One wagon
will sprinkle from -one to tour miles a day.-
The sprinkling of the streets of Oakland is
â .done by the city, teams being. hired by the
."Superintendent of Streets whenever required
and Daid $4 per day.
â  Mr. Freud and the other speakers 'ad
vised the sprinklers to combine and hold
themselves in readiness to accept con
tracts from the City in the event that the
City should undertake to directly super
vise the street-sprinkling system.
, It .was unanimously resolved that the
Merchants' Association shall use every
reasonable effort to induce the Board of
Supervisors, upon fixing the new tax levy,
to make ample provision for sprinkling
the streets of San Francisco uniformly
' and systematically.
In the evening there was an important
session of the executive committee.
Figures were exhibited to show that at the
end of the current fiscal year there would
be a surplus of about $21,000 remaining of
the street-sweeping and sprinkling fund
out of the original appropriation oi $150,
--000, secured largely through the efforts of
the association. '
None of this fund up to the present
time has been used for sprinkling. It was
therefore decided to petition the Board of
Supervisors to have the streets sprinkled
from now until the beginning of the fiscal
year, so that an intelligent estimate for
, the purpose can be made for next year. It is
estimated that if this is done, there will be
left the $21,000 surplus mentioned.
It is the purpose of the association to
petition the Board of Supervisors to ex
pend this sum in converting some of tne
cobble-paved streets in the. heart of the
business section into bituminous pave
ments. Among the streets that will be
recommended for improvement in this
connection are Post from Montgomery to
Stockton, Geary from Kearny to Powell,
Stockton from Market to Sutter.
The matter of securing the economical
transportation of the street sweepings to
Golden Gate Park was discussed. The
association's efforts are now particularly
directed to securing lots in which these
sweepings may be dumped pending their
- need at the park.
An interesting and gratifying communi
cation on the subject of street-sweeping
was received from Colonel George E. War
ing, Commissioner of the Department of
Street-cleaning of New York City. It was
in part as follows:
The most suggestive communication that thÂ«
Department of Street-cleaning of New York
City can offer at this time is the announcement
of the fact that it has | determined, after a very
careful- consideration and calculation, to aban
don almost entirely the use of street sweeping
machines.: "-â¢â¢â¢- â â¢ -â â¢
It is found that hand-sweeping is more per
fect in its results, 1 and | that under all ordinary
conditions it is 'at least as cheap. This is es
pecially true wherever there is a regular force
as there is here. A force large enough to main
tain a good condition in winter time, when
machines cannot be used and when the streets
are most used and littered, is surely large
enough to maintain a perfect condition in the
â¢warmer reasons, when alone it has been the
custom to use sweeping-machines in New York
City.
Aff INEXACT DISPATCH.

In a telegram from Ukiah published in
yesterday morning's papers, reference was
made to John D. Holiingsworth as being

that the assertion be denied. Hollings

until A.pril 1, 1806, wh< n his commission
was revoked. Since that date he has not

WORKMEN WANT MONEY
They Complain That They Are
Being Defrauded of Wages
Due.
The Labor Commission Intervenes in
Behalf of Two of the
Victims.
"The public ought to know about a
piece of flagrant rascality which has lat
terly been perpetrated," remarked Deput
Labor Commissioner Dam yesterday.
"On Saturday morning the cases of Ty
ler vs. Bowers and McDermott vs. Bower
will come up for hearing before Judg
Groezinger. The actions are nothing bu
ordinary suits for payment on account o
services rendered; but behind the mass o
entangled legal phraseology in whicii a
actions at law are involved lies an infin
tude of villainy which should call forth
burst of popular indignation.
"Tyler and McDermott are two out o
many men who went to work under agree
ment with a man named Bowers, who ha
taken the contract for the demolition and
removal of the old American Exchange
Hotel building. After working for some
days the men asked for money.
A dollar or two was all that
each petitioner could obtain. Demands
one by one began to pour in, and when
the genial Bowers found himself sur
rounded by an angry crowd of men seek
ing money he became flustered. The
proper procedure under the circumstances
seemed to be the adoption of an attitude
of dignified defiance. Accordingly, the
next Tan who asked for his money was
suavely advised to take his departure for
the infernal recions.
"I consider this the most aggravated
case of swindling that has ever ci>me be
fore this bureau," commented Mr. Dam.
"Had 1 been consulted in a private ca
pacity, on the street or in my home, and
not in this public office, I might have
urged more summary methods; but since
the matter came before me officially I
was obliged to do the next best thing. I
told them to sue at once, and recom
mended them to a good attorney, Mr.
McCabe of 1027 Market street, who took
charge of their cases forthwith. The
matters came up for hearing about a week
ago, and Bowers entered a demurrer to
the two complaints, stating that he had
not the wherewithal to pay the amount cf
the claims. To this demurrer the plain
tiffs will make answer to-morrow.
"In order to release himself from the
attachments which Tyler and McDermott
had levied against "him Bowers put up
bonds with Oscar Lewis and Julia Green as
sureties. Then he told the plaintiffs they
could sue or do what they pleased. The j
attachments had been levied UDon the
debris and materials of tne old hotel.
Even before the bonds were issued
Borers commenced to remove the stuff to
his yard. Still the material is in his.cus
tody and must be held liable for the claims
of the workmen. The outcome of the suit
is looked for with much interest by the
other workmen, who have allowed Tvler
and McDermott to take the lead in order
to know what policy to follow in order to
get their own wages. The Labor Commis
sion will side with the workmen, and I for
one hope they will win."
PARLOR SUFFRAGISTS.
They Listen to Speeches by Mrs. Sargent
and Dr. Treadwell, the First
Woman Dentist.
The regular meeting of the "Eleventh
Amendment Club" was held at 7 Van
Ness avenue yeÃterday afternoon, many of
those whose names have by long associa
tion become identified with the cause of
woman suffrage being present. This club
was organized at the dwelling of Mme.
Sorbier, 220 Van Ness avenue, and was the
first parlor suffrage club brought into ex
istence in the State.
The principal events of the evening were
an essay by Mrs. A. A. Sargent, president
of the State Suffrage Association, and an
impromptu speech by Dr. Treadwell, who
is said to be the first woman dentist of the
world.
Mrs. SarKont's paper was devoted to the
eleventh amendment, and dwelt at length
on the opinions expressed by prominent
educators and economists in the press as
regards granting the ballot to the gentler
sex.
Dr. Treadwell's words had mainly to do
with the difference between women of the
present and twenty years ago.
"Two decades ago," said this lady, "the
idea of a woman leading a professional life
was deemed absurd. A female lawyer,
preacher or physician was looked upoh as
a candidate for the museum.
"To-day phe engages in all these branches
of higher labor, and has conclusively
demonstrated to the male element that,
although the }:ray matter of his cerebral
organ may excel in quantity, when it
comes to quality the weaker sex makes
good the deficit.
It was decided to give Miss Anthony a
reception at 7 Van Ness avenue the second
Tuesday of this month, the reception to
begin at Br. m. Mrs. H. Lewis, the club's
treasurer, thought the name of the body
should be changed to something less pro
saic, but the matter was temporarily iaid
on the table. The next meeting will be
held at Mrs. M. G. Wheeland's, 1323 Clay
street, when a new club for her district
will be formed.

J. R. Mai tin, assistant secretary.
The slated programme for the presi
dency was carried out as The Call pre
dicted. Mr. Phelan was placed in nomi
nation for the first office by Mr. Platt, but
declined to accept a third term. Mr. Platt
was then placed in nomination and elected
without opposition.

AUTOCRATS OF THE ROSES
Easter, North Winds and the
Nurserymen Have Stopped
the War.
Florists Won't Sell Choice Flowers
Below the Well-Established
Rates.
Among the florists who have been at
war over the price of flowers, and more
especially roses, there is a cessation of
hostilities. For in this instance man has
not had the disposition of things all to
himself. The weather had much to do
with the question in the last few days,
while incidentally nurserymen entered
intothe spirit of the occasion and said :
"No flowers for men who are cutting
prices of our patrons. We want no war in
ours."
So the fight of roses has faded with
winds from the north and an ultimatum
from growers round San Francisco. And
roses that a few days ago bold for 15 or 25
cents a dozen, that is, for a pretty,
fragrant bouquet with sprays of smilax or
maidenhair and glistening drops of dew
that fell from a 20-cent water spray upon
the petals, are now belling for 25 or 35
cents. With Easter there is an advance in
prices. Lilies are rare beyond fancy, and
as for roses, they are almost doubled in
price.
The florists themselves do not wish to
be known in a discussion of the fight. "It
would only advertise the other fellow,"
i they say, "and people would think that
we were holding out for high prices. That
means crowds would flock to where garden
roses are sold, and the fine hothouse va
rieties would be neglected by all but con
noisseurs."
A florist explained last night that the
war in roses was started by some small
dealers when tine weaiher ushered in more
of these blossoms than could be sold.
Then the north wind blew cold, and
even in the florists' windows roses wilted
and withered in one night. Garden roses
suffered most, and such as were able to
bear shaking and transporting became
scarce. It was when this condition im
posed itself several dealers, without or
ganizing, complained with common ac
cord to the nurserymen that if the cut-rate
fellows were supplied the rest would buy
roses elsewhere.
Charles Hasselbacher of Temescal, who
is the largest grower of roses in the vicinity
of San Francisco, told the cheap men he
would not sell roses to tuera unless they
took down their signs of cut rates. In
that case they would have to depend upon
open-air roses, for as Hasseibacher went
other nurserymen followed. In one case,
that of a florist on Geary street, near
Kearny, there was a difference of opinion.
"I won't sell you roses until those signs
of cheap flowers are taken down."
There were signs of "roses 15 cents and
25 cents a dozen' about the shops.
"I'll run my own business, was the
florist's abrupt reply.
"Run your own* business," added the
nurseryman. "You get none of my roses."
And now if you want the Kaiserine of
vanishing beauty, the American beauties
themselves, or of the few other choice
roses, they cost as of old from 35 cents to $1
a dozen. Easter demand has done this to
a large degree, for Flora must provide her
best lor Eastertide.
HE FOUNDED FORESTRY.
Thomas Lindsay on His Way to
the High Court of the
World.
JUST ARRIVED FROM HONOLTTLU
He Initiated King Ealakaua Into the
Mysteries of the Order in This
City.
Thomas Lindsay, founder of the order of
Forestry in the West, now of Honolulu
and on his way to attend the session of
the High Court of the world to be held in
Dundee, Scotland, in August, is stopping
in this City.
Mr. Lindsay is 56 years of age, but his
I brown eyes, hair, mustache and good
j clothes do not indicate the even half cen
| tury. He is a jeweler by trade and until
the fall of the royal house of Kalakaua he
was jeweler to his Majesty. In fact Mr.
Lindsay led the royal Kalakaua through
I all the mysteries of Forestry when his
Majesty was visiting San Francisco and
before he, Lindsay, had even seen Hono
j luluâ which has been hisplace of residence
J for seventeen years. After he took up his
I residence in Hawaii Mr. Lindsay immedi
j ately began to institute Forestry and there
the King sat at his right hand regularly on
loige nights for years and eagerly im
bibed whatsoever was essential to his pro
gress and good standing in the order.
Kalakaua, says Lindsay, belonged to
all the orders, was a fiirty-third degree
Mason, and when he went to Scotland they
took him aside and conferred some special
and still higher honor of the order, so tiiat
he stood upon a Masonic eminence almost
all his own.
"I had stood hi*h in the order in the old
country," said Mr. Lindsay yesterday.
"When I came here I found no fellowship.
I advertised a call for a meeting of men
who had been in the order elsewhere, and
there was quite a generous and altogether
pleasing response. The result was the or
ganization of Robin Court No. 5931 in a
hall on Mission street, with quite a large
membership at the very beginning. It was
there, almost immediately after the order
was instituted here, we initiated King
Kalakaua, then on bis return journey from
tiie East. John M. Lapana, Secretary of
State to the King, was also initiated. That
was in February, 1875.
"The order grew very rapidly, and in
October of the same year we organized
another court, Eureka No. 6140. These
conns are still In existence.
"The following year we instituted
Aurora Court in a hall on Kearny street,
and shortly afterward America Court in
the Potrero.
â¢ The order spread rapidly, and a Sub
sidiary High Court was established having
jurisdiction over the Pacific Coast. The
Subsidiary Court appointed me deputy
district chief ranger tor trie State of Cali
fornia with authority and instruction to j
institute courts throughout the State, in- !
itiate members and exemplify the work
ings of the order.
"I held this office until I determined to
go to Hawaii, and in 1879, for that pur- i
pose, tendered my resignation.
"1 was the first chief ranger in the courts j
organized in this Cily that I have named, i
In Honolulu two courts have been organ
ized, of which Kalakaua was the chief
| ranger o* the first, named Lunalilo No.
6600. It is from this court that I go to !
England as delegate to the sitting of the i
Higli Court of the World. This court is
still under the direct juriÂ«diction of that
court. The newer court is under the
jurisdiction of the Subsidiary High Court !
of the Pacific Coast, which will sit at j
Ukiah in May. A delegate from that
court will attend the session."
Speaking of the order generally Mr.
Lindsay said: "Of the benevolent or
beneficiary orders it is the greatest in
numbers. Its courts are to be found in
every land where the English language is
spoken. You will find it in South Africa,
Australia, the far East, North and South, j
It began back in the dim past, beyond the
memory of man, but in 1766 it took from
the then name of Royal Foresters its pres
ent name of Ancient Order of Foresters.
That was in England, whence the
order with its present ritual spread over
the world. It now has upward of a mil
lion members.
"As auxiliaries to the order, there is the
female courtsâ bearing the same rela
tion to Forestry as the Rebekahs to Odd
Fellowship â and the juvenile order.
"In this jurisdiction the female courtB â
so called everywhere alfro in the world,
bear the name of Companions of the
Forest. Queen Victoria is a regularly in
itiated member of the order, as is also
Princess Louise. The Queen is designated
as patroness of the court No. 8160, and the
Princess is vice-patroness."
Mr. Lindsay wears a beautiful gold
badge- presented to him "as a token of es
teem from the members of Lunalilo Court,
on the occasion of his twenty-fifth anniver
sary in the order."
On the reverse side of the medal is the
inscription: "Initiated into Court Duna
din, A. O. F., No. 5257, September. 1869.
Founded and instituted by courts of the
order to date September, 1894."
Mr. Lindsay will remain in the City a few
days and then pass on to his native land.

afternoon while engaged in moving a house
from 1510 Devisadero street. Maloney, as
sisted by J. Maron, was working under a six
foot embankment, when, without a moment's
warning, it caved in and buried both work
men. Maron succeeded in scrambling out, but
Maloney was seriously injured and was unable
to assist himself. Maron shoveled the dirt
off the top of his friend as soon as pos
sible, but it was too late, as the unfortunate la
borer had smothered. The body was taken to
the Morgue.

DR. BUCK'S FIRST LETTER
The Successor of William Q.
Judge to the Order in
America.
Communication Received in This City
From the New Theosophical
Leader.
J. D. Buck, M.D., vice-president of the
Theosophical Society in America, and
who. it is confidently expected, will succeed
to the presidency left vacant by the late
William Q. Judge, has issued his first
document as head of the Theosophists of
America.
The document in question has just been
received in this City. It is written in
masterly style and is a fair specimen of
the literary excellence that prevails
throughout all the writings of Dr. Buck.
It treats directly of the death of Mr. Judge
and reads as follows:
To the Theosophical Society in America and its
Praters throughout the Worldâ Brothers: Our
lender hus disappeared from the field of con
flict. With courage undaunted, with will un
conquered, with zeal unabated, with devotion
undlminishedâ the vehicle failed. The chariot
went to pieces on the field of battle and the
charioteer is lost from the sight of men. Wil-
I liam Quan Judge has finished the work given
him to do for this generation and reserving j
scarcely time from his great work in which to j
die has left us only memories and the record j
and power of his example. The influence of
these has extended around the globe and will
help to mold the thought of the coming
century. Energy, steadfastness and devotion
were the characteristics of his life, while be
neath the sometimes stern exterior, impatient
at folly and triviality that wasted time and de
flected energy from work and duty, there beat
a "warm Irish heart" as gentle as a woman's
and as tender as a child's. Those who saw
him most appreciated him most; those who
knew him best loved and trusted him unre
servedly. And why all this confidence and
love? Simply because he was the soul of de
votion; because he utterly sank self and sacri
ficed everything to the work he had undertaken ;
the spread of truth and the permanency of
the. T. S. There was an undercurrent in his
life like that of the deep sea, and this never
ceased its flow or lost its source for an instant.
His resources seemed inexhaustible, and his
judgment of men and measures wonderfully
exact. In ten years of very intimate associa
tion I have never once discovered a purpose
outside his beloved T. S. Night and day, in
sickness and health, racked with pain or in
the pleasant hours of social intercourse, you
could detect but one only motive and aim; and
when the veil of silence fell over his spoken
words his busy pen ignored the pain, and sent
scores of messages and words of advice and en
couragement all over the world. I never be
fore witnessed such determination to live,
such unconsciousness of possible defeat, such
unwillingness to stop work. I tried last De
cember to get him to stop work and use his j
waning strength to regain healthâ but in vain.
And so he worked on to the last, and only de
sisted when he could neither walk nor stand;
and when from choking cough and weariness
he could scarcely lie down or sleep. He was in
deed the lion-hearted and worthy successor of
his great teacher, H. P. B.
feel sure that I am voicing the thought of
thousands in this estimate of the character
and life work of our champion and leader.
The application is plain. His lifework and
sacrifice must not be in vain, his example
must not be lost. "Those who are wise in
spiritual things grieve neither for the living
nor for the dead." Steadfastness, devotion
and work I should be our motto, no less than
the text and the sermon, on this occasion.
"Deeds, not words, are what we want," once
wrote a master. Mourning and sorrow may be
in all our hearts, and the gentleness and ten
derness thus engendered should only enrich
and make more fruitful the soul of our own
lives, and the blossom and the fruit be for the
healing of the nations. The century draws
near its close; our annual convention is near
at hand. Let us show by greater devotion,
more courage and a deeper sense of brother
hood that the sacrifice of our brother, William
Q. Judge, has not been in vain, but that he
still lives and works in us; and so there can be
no death, but transition only; no destruction,
but rejuvenescence, and no defeat to him "who
realizes that he Is one with the Supreme Spirit."
J. D. Buck, Vice-President T. S. in A.
The death of Mr. Judge has made it ad
visable to change the meeting-place of the
National Theosophical Convention from
Chicago to New York, and an order to
this effect has already been promulgated
by the executive committee. The date of
the convention is April 26.
Freight Agont of the Erie Dispatch.
C. \V. Colby has been appointed Pacific Coast
freight agent of the Erie Dispatch line, with
headquarters in this City. This is the first
time the Hrie has been represented by a local
frctrbt ageiv, and the step was taken to better
protect its portion of the through freight busi
ness.
Mr. Colby was formerly with the Union Pa-<
cific Company. and recently was the California
aeent of the Armour refrigerator car line,
which handles the citrus fruit crop for the
East. His territory embraces from Portland to
Sun Diego.
ThÂ» ''Cathode Ray."
A new weekly eight-page publication called
the Cathode Ray made Its appearance last
Wednesday. It is published at 535 Clay street,
and has a creditable appearance. It is diffi
cult from a perusal of the introductory edi
torial to tell just wnat its object in life is, but its
editor says 'it shines upon the threshhold of
everyday affaire with no apologies," and the
public must accept the young journal on its
merits.
HER IDEA OF GENEROSITY
Mrs. Hastings, an Eastern Lady,
Leaves Her Well-Filled
Purse in a Car.
Gripman Martin. Who Was the
Means of Restoring; It Was
Rewarded With $i 50.
Gripman Martin of car 38 of the Califor
nia-street Cable Company made a lucky
find yesterday morning, and visions of
wealth took possession of his mind.
After the passengers had left the car at
the corner of o'Farrell and Stockton
streets, he noticed a well-filled pocket-book
on the seat of the dummy. On the return
trip he left the pocketbook in the office of
the company on Hyde and California
streets.
On being opened it was found to contain
a check for $4000, payable to bearer, $165
in gold and a roll of greenbacks. Martin
continued liis trip, fondly expecting that
the owner would handsomely rem unerate
him for his honesty.
A lady alighted from the car that fol
lowed Martin's, and rushing into the com
pany's office, she excitedly asked if her
pocket-book, which she had left on the
seat of the dummy, had been found. She
said her name was Mrs. Hastings, and
she was here on a visit from the East.
She detailed the contents of the pocket
book, and to her great joy it was handed
to her.
She expressed an earnest desire to see
Gripman Martin, and left something in an
envelope to be given to him if she should
fail to see him. She waited on the corner,
and when Martin's car pulled up on its
way to O'Farrell and Stockton streets she
rushed over to him and in the exuberance
of her joy embraced him, at the same time
thanking him profusely for being the
means of restoring her property to her.
"You dear, honest man," she said, "I
have not forgotten you. When you go to
the office you will find something waiting
for you that will show you how much I
appreciate your worth." Then she left
him and Martin saw her no more.
Martin hurried to the office and the
envelope was handed to him. He tore it
open and to his bitter disappointment all
it contained was $1 50.
Brighano Young would make a dinner on
tripe washed down with beer.

HOME PRODUCTS CLUBS
A New Constitution and By-
La ws Prepared for
Them.
PLEDGE OF THE MEMBERS.
Clubs to Be Organized by Messrs.
Sonntag and Tacy in Bakers
field and Oakland.
The special committee of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, ap
pointed for the purpose of compiling a
constitution and by-laws for the "homo
products clubs" which the association de
sires to establish in the interior towns,
completed its labors yesterday afternoon.
Trie constitution and by-laws thus pre
pared will be submitted to the association
at its next meeting, and if approved will
govern the home products clubs of the
State. Following are a few extracts from
the proposed constitution.
Article I. This organization shall be known
as the Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion Homo Product Club No. of , Cal.
Article 11. The object of this club shall be to
work in conjunction with the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association of California to en
courage the manufacture and production as
well as the distribution and consumption of
California products; to aid the association in
the collection of statistics of the manufactures
and products, and to investigate and report
upon the undeveloped resources of the city of
Oakland.
Article 111, section 1. Any person, male or
female, over 15 years of age may become a
member of this club by subscribing in tripli
cate to the following pledge:
I hereby pledge myself, price and quality
permitting, to give the preference to articles
of California manufacture or production in
everything that I purchase or use, and will
endeavor to induce others to do likewise, and
thus assist home industry.
Article IV. The government of the club shall
be vested in a board of directors, who shall be
residents of the county of Alameda, and who
shall be elected at the annual meeting of the
members. Any member, male or female,
twenty-one years of age, in good standing in
the club is eligible as a director or officer.
In the by-laws are found the following
provisions:
The recording secretary shall transmit at
least once each month a report of the work of
the club to the secretary of the Manufacturer^
and Producers' Association of California.
Sec. 2. At the first regular meeting of the
members of ihe club,;held in the months of
January, April, July and October, the members
are to be requested to report how largely they
have used home products and where they had
been obliged to use imported articles give
reasons for so doing, in order that the matter
be inquired into by a committee appointed by
the president for that purpose.
Julian Sonntag and S. H. Tacy were ap
pointed to institute home products clubs
in Oakland and Bakersneld. In the last
named town great preparations are being
made for the reception of the organizers.
Mr. Tacy reports that much enthusiasm
is manifest in the country towns in rela
tion to the work of the home products
clubs, and indications are that a goodly
number of them will be organized iv the
near future.
PICKLE FACTORY EURNED.
Fire on Bnttery Street Causei $3000
Damagesâ A $10 Jt'ire.
G. Ward's pickie factory at 919 Battery
street caught tire at 4 p. m. yesterday, ana
within half an bour the building ha i been
almost totally destroyed. The adjoining
properties were also badly damaged, the
total loss amounting to about $3000.
A coal -oil stove which was being used to
heat water suddenly exploded, throwing a
mass of burning oil over the floor of the
factory, and in a few moments the build
ing was a msss of flames.
An alarm was turned in through box
355, ana in a short time a number of
streams were playing on the fire, but ow
ing to the combustible nature of the build
ing they aid little good. The flames
finally spread to B. Zolla's boathouse at
917 and later to John Ninnery's lodging
house at 921 Battery street. After half an
hour's stubborn fighting the flames were
under control.
The loss to the pickle factory will
amount to $2000, fully covered by insur
ance. Ninnery's loss is $1000. T'ne boat
house was damaged to the extent of $100
partly covered by insurance.
An alarm was sounded through box 63
at 6 o'clock last evening for a fire in a
frame dwelling-house at 212 Clara street
occupied by William Gordon. The explo
sion of a coal-oil lamp caused the fire
Â« hich damaged the building to the extent
of about $10.THOSE MAGICAL
ROENTGEN RAYS
Results tfhat May Follow'
From the Berkeley
Experiments.
WIDESPREAD INTEREST.
Practical Advantages to Be Se
cured by Determining the
True Source.
PROFESSOR IE CONTE CONCURS.
Great Importance of the Discovery
Made by Professor Cory and
His Assistants.
BERKELEY, Cat.., April 2.â The scien
tific statement of Professor Clarence L.
( ory of tbe department of mechanics at
the State University regarding the source
of the Roentgen ray has created comment
Of the most widespread aud thoughtful !
nature from all quarters.
Heretofore only short and compara
tively incomplete statements have been
made concerning the intricate and pecu
harly delicate process pursued by the '
Berkeley experimenters in arriving at the
conclusions which seem to indicate the
true origin of the magic ray. But the
statement published to-day in The Call
covers the entire field of their work, and
enters into the most minute details
in explaining the scientific principles
involved in reaching the sought-for end â i
that of determining how the ray is formed
and where it comes from. The problem .
has been a most difficult one and it is only â 
after the exertion of the greatest skill and
energy that the professors have arrived at
a conclusion which they feel they are safe
in backing up.
They have the concurrence of a number
of other professors and instructors at the
university, among whom are Dr. Joseph
Le Conte, the veteran scientist, Professor
Plate and In-tructor Drew. The results
reached, however, differ from those of
Professor Sanford of Stanford Univer
sity and Dr. Philip Mills Jones of San
Francisco, which gentlemen have been
ftudying aud investigating the origin of
the Roentgen ray for some time past.
Professor Cory believes that the
fluorescent glass has much to do with the
matter of determining the source of the j
ray, while Dr. Jones believes that it has '
no effect whatever. Professor Cory says !
that he is more than confident of his posi
tion with relation to the fluorescent glass.
The result of the university experiments
to determine the origin of the Roentgen
ray seems to be that the cathode rays
electrify any solid upon which they im- i
pinge, probably by carrying electrified |
particles to the solid. "The source of the
Roentgen rays, then," says Processor !
Cory, 'is the solid upou which the ;
cathode ray tirst strikes and gives up or â 
partially gives up its negative charge. A !
second solid behind the tirst may be a j
source of the rays, however, if the first
solid does not take up the entire negative
charge from the cathode ray."
"The Roentgen rays may therefore pro
ceed from the anode, the fluorescent glass,
a disconnected terminal or a grounded
terminal, provided the shape of the tube j
and the relative positions of the electrodes
be such that the cathode rays impinge on
the anode, glass, disconnected or grounded
terminal respectively. That the anode, !
because it is the anode, may he the source i
of the Roentgen rays is probable, but the !
fact that in almost every case when the
anode has been found to be the source of
the raya the shape of the tube has been
such that tbe cathode rays impinged ,
directly upon it."
The importance of the discovery which i
the professors kere at the State University
seem to have made can only be measured
by the almost limitless use to which the j
lloentgen rays can be put. The origin
and theory of the rays once being solved, I
its applications will be without number.
Even with the rude apparatus with which
the Berkeley experimenters have been |
working they have reached results of a i
most marvelous nature. The first great
experiment which they made was the '
locating of a bullet in the hand of young I
(iunnison. The physicians had probed I
for the bullet which was supposed to
have been in the boy'a hand, but j
their skill was baffled. They thought to c i
bullet must be in his hand, but they had !
not proof of it. The reason they had for â¢
beleiving that it was still in his hand was !
because there appeared to be no place j
where it could havg come out. The j
wounded lad was brought to Berkeley and j
had his hand placed under the ray-con- j
veying tube. The electric fluid was turned j
on and was allowed to run for one hour
and a half. The plate was developed, but i
was found to have been under-exposed.
The experiment was again tried, and after J
an exposure of two and one half hours
the plate was developed, showing
clearly the location of the bullet.
From this the scientists have turn- I
ed to other even more successful I
experiments with equally good if not bet- j
ter results. Their machinery has been so j
much in proved since the lir>t work that :
they can now take a photograph of a
man's hand Bhowin^ complete and dis- j
tinct articulation with an exposure of j
from ten to twenty minutes. To photo- |
graph coins in a leather purse with a fitty ;
seconds' exposure is arc ordinary occur
rence.
Aluminum is particularly fitted for the
piirpusa of determining the relative j
ttreiitflh of tubes. It is not in the least
fjpaque to the powerful rays.
SALMON OR TROUT?
The Steclhcatl Question Again Threshed
. Out Before a Jury in Judge :
JnachiinsÂ«u'fi Court*
The perplexing question of whether a
steelhead is a trout or â¢ salmon, , which
Judge Low refused to determine some
â weeks ago, was again threshed out in
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday after-'
noon.
. On March 10 the American Union Fish
â¢ Company of 513 Washington street re
ceived a consignment of steeiheads from
biskiyou County, and they, wore promptly
seized by Pish Warden Mo^an, who swore
out a warrant for the arrest of J.B.
Ingngha, manager of the company. The
, tnarge was ottering for sale fish out of
ecason.
The case was tried before a jury in Judge
Joachimsen's court yesterday afternoon,
and different varieties of trontand salmon,
which had been kept in a refrigerator, were
submitted for the inspection of the jury.
Fish Commissioner Babcock testified
that a steelhead was a trout, and referred
to President Jordan of Stanford Univer
sity as an authority on the point. Fish
Warden Mogan also testified to the same
effect.
Attorney Ruef put the defendant on the
stand. He declared that a steelhead was
a salmon, and was considered such by all
fish-dealers.
After argument of counsel the jury re
tired but failed to agree, ten being lor con
viction and two for acquittal. Rather
than be at the worry and expense of an
other trial the defendant offered to plead
guilty if a small tine was imposed, and the
Judge mulcted him in $10.
Talked of Siberia.
Harry de VVindt, member of the Royal Geo
eraphical Society of London, delivered an in
teresting lecture on Siberia before the San
Francisco Geographical Society last night. Tiie
speaker dwelt at considerable length on the
supposed hardships of the icebound country,
endeavoring to convey to his audience the
impression that Russia's Asiatic emoire was
not nearly so bad as it had been pictured. Mr.
de _Windt"added interest to his discourse by a
series of pictures illustrative of tne country
through which he had passed.
A Desk of Brass.
The Episcopalian Church Divinity School at
San Mateo has just received a handsome gift
from Christ Church, Los Angeles. It consists
of a large altar-desk of brass, made by Geissler
of New York. The design is very elegant, and
the desk is larsre, as well as handsome. There
is great Mtlsfaction at the theological school
over the gift, as it is considered to be a token
that the school Is looked upon as an institu
tion of the Episcopalian church on the Pacitic
Coast, and not merely a diocesan institution.

FRANK BROTHERS SUED
A Local Hardware Firm Being I
Driven Toward Insol- .
vency.
i It Owes Over Two Hundred Thousand j
Dollars on Old Debts and Con
signments.
Suit has been commenced against Frank
; Brothers, the effect of which will be to j
i drive â¢ the defendants into insolvency, j
The firm was very near to it once. In 1893 ;
, the creditors were . clamoring for their
money, and the firm finally stayed pro- j
; ceedings by compromising. The agree- J
i ment made then was that the business >
! should be run for the benefit of the j
creditors until 50 cents on the dollar had
been paid. The debts then amounted to
j a good many thousand dollars. This order
j of things has been in effect ever since, but
; the suit just filed will disturb it all.
Peter a. MacGowan, Frank S. Seymour
and A. H. Lindeke. as receiver of the
I Walter G. Wood Harvester Company, an
I insolvent corporation of Minneapolis, are
| plaintiffs.* They seen to have an account
i ing and also to have a receiver appointed
ito wind up the affairs of the firm. The
Wood Harvester Company has been send
ing goods out to tie Franks under con-
I signment/they to sell them and remit the
; proceeds, less a commission. In 1893 the
j Franks owed the harvester company
j $14,290 86 and only $2930 had been paid on
1 the account. An accounting was then
i had, and it was found the firm owed over
j $200,000. Among the debts were $70,000
I due the Crocker-Woolworth Bank and
j $50,000 due Mrs. Emily Pope.
In the complaint it is charged that the
, Franks did not keep their agreement and
! that all the money due the harvester peo
! pie did not find its way to them.
: One of the Frank brothers is dead and
| the other is sued as surviving partner.
: He is not to be found, however, and- the
i complaint states that the business has
I been left in the hands of clerks, and that
it is rapidly running down.

FIELD MARSHAL'S SPEECH.
Eloquent Pledges of Amity Between
tbe United States and
Japan.
The Marquis Field Marshal Yamagata
of Japan was the distinguished guest of
the Chamber of Commerce yesterday after
noon. A reception given in his honor was
attended by 150 citizens of San Francisco,
many of whom were representative mer
chants and professional men. At the
platform the flags of the United States
and Japan were joined.
Hugh Craig, vice-president of the cham
ber, introduced the guest, speaking as fol
lows :
During the history of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce its members have had
the privilege and pleasure of tendering the
courtesies of the City to distinguished statesmen
and Generals of other nations, and it is fitting
that at this meeting place of the Occident anrl i
the Orient such courtesies should be extended
to distinguished guests.
We have with us to-day a gentleman who
represents in a marked degree the old and new '
condition of affairs in that great nation which j
has, by force of charater, placed itself in the !
front rank of the great nations of the earth.
When our Commodore Perry gave the right
hand of fellowship to the Japanese Govern
ment forty-two years ago, the American peo
ple undertook the responsibility of fathering j
this new nation into the general family, mid !
with what success, a careful examination of
national events the other side of the Paci
fic will show.
A recent report issued by the Yokohama
Chamber of Commerce sets forth that out of
$1'23,U00,000 of the foreign trade of Japan for
the year 1894, $41,000,000, or one-third, was
with the Urited States, and this Chamber of i
Commerce only voices the sentiments of the 1
people of California and the United States at i
large in the desire to cultivate the further ex- I
tension of such intimut.- relations.
Our honored guest comes to us as a broad- j
minded statesman, a trusted councilor and a!
victorious general, and to -him, in the name of j
the City of Francisco and the Btate oi Cali
fornia, we tender our best wishes for a safe and
prosperous journey to his destination at Mos-
COW, a safe return to his home in Japan, and !
that he will convey to the Emperor of Japan j
and his people our best wishes and highest re- !
gards for the prosperity aud growth of their !
country.
Marshal Yamagata responded to the
greeting, speaking the Japanese language.
The speech was repeated in English by the
interpreter. He spoke as if ti;e Marquis
himself were speaking and expressed un
mixed joy and satisfaction over the hos
pitable and kind reception accorded, and
accepted the demonstration as another
proof of the comity and courtesy existing
between Japan and the United States.
' Neighbors as we are it is but natural that
we hail you as the harbinger of civiliza
tion. History throws more vivid light on
this friendship and development than my
words can express. I can assure you that
sentiments of sympathy and admiration
for Americans have been awakened in
Japan. I feel sure that the triple ties of
history, neighborhood and sympathy will
keep alive the cordial amity which has so
long existed. Of the high eulogistic term
in which your president has spoken of me
j personally, I can say that 1 do not merit
the eulogy, but the friendly and hospitable
sentiment co expressed /or Japan by Mr.
Craig are reciprocated. In thanking you
once more let me assure you that in leaving
you I take the modt agreeable souvenirs
of the hospitality and courteny of the
people of California."
The speech of the Marquis as inter
preted by his accomplished interpreter
was greeted with the warmest applause.
The president then introduced George
W. McN'ear, but the gram merchant asked
to be excused from making an address, and
the excuse was granted.
Tlie next speaker introduced was Saburo
Koya, the Consul of Japan in this City.
He responded, expressing thanks for the
j honor conferred in being requested to ad
dress an audience of San Francisco mer
chants. He referred to the kindness which
Japan entertained for the United States
and said that the sentiment of admiration
for America was understood and appre
ciated by the Japanese schoolboy. He
assured his listeners tnat Japan would
continue to be the friend of America. He
hoped that the ties of friendship which
joined the two countries together would
never be broken. He spoke of Commo
dore Perry, and said his visit enlightened
Japan, not for America alone, but for all
the world.
At the conclusion of the Consul's, re
marks Mr. Craig invited the merchants
and others present to come forward and
receive introduction to the Marquis Yaraa
gata. A line was formed ana in turn
each comer grasped the hand of the Field
Marshal.
Among the representative citizens at
tending the reception were:
Professor George Davidson, General J. T.
Houghton, Louis Parrott, Barry Baldwin, Isaac
Upham, Arthur Moore, Colonel W. R. Smed
berg, I. W. Hellman, George Newhall, I. M.

fell From a Pole.
James Hutton, a lineman in the employ of
the Western Union Telegraph Company, wns
at work on the top of a role at California and
Buchanan streets yesterday morning when he
lost his grip and fell to the ground. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where Dr.
Weil found that his left arm was broken in two
places, his elbow dislocated and his right arm
broken. His nose was also fractured, and he
appeared to have sustained internal injuries.
Longbridge's Extradition.
The necessary papers for the extradition of
William Longbridge, one of the men charged
â with robbing the State Bank of Savannah, Mo.,

TAIT LEFT HIS JESSIE
A Prospective Bride Who Waited
in Vain for the Bride
groom.
He Started From the License Office
to Pay the Fee, but Failed
to Return.
Up to closing hour, at 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon, Thomas Tait had not
turned up at the office of the marriage
license clerk at the City Hall to claim a
license that had been made out at his re
quest more than twenty-four hours be
fore. About 3 o'clock on Wednesday after
noon Tait and a female companion, who
looked to be many years his senior, called
at the otfice and signitied their intention
of traveling the path of life together. After
Tait had stated that his age was 37 years,
and that he lived Â«t (561 Eighth street,
Oakland, and that his prospective bride,
Jessie Fox, was 50 years of age and resided
at 405 Franklin street of the same city, he
was given the customary tag and told to
go to the Treasurer's oinee, pay the fee
and return for his license.
Tait carried out the programme to the
extent of starting in the direction of the
fee office, but up to 4 o'clock yesterday he
had failed to return with nis receipt.
Mrs. Fox â she admitted being a widow,
waited the first half hour patiently, the
second impatiently and the third almost
in tears.
Cupid Danforth out of pity for her Tor
lorn appearance kept the cilice open half
an hour after the regular time, but the
bridegroom came not, and he was re
luctantly compelled to inform Mrs. Fox
that she must find other quarters to wait
for Tait or go in search of Him. fche con
cluded to take the latter course, and at 5
o'clock was seen wandering about the cor
ridors looking anxiously for her Thomas
and asking various officials whether it was
possible that he might have been lost in
the mazes of the hall. Since then neither
of the parties has been seen, and Cupid
is wondering whether Tait lost his way or
concluded that discretion was the better
part of valor and left for parts unknown.
If it turns out that Thomas was actually
bewildered by the municipal labyrinth,
this will be an additional argument in
lavor of Mayor Sutro's demand for a
directory of the new City Hall.
MISSION B^RGLAKS.
The Residence of ( lihilcs Herold on San
Itruno Road Twice Entered.
Charles Herold, a blacksmith on the San
Bruno road, near Array street, reported to
tbe police yesterday that his house had
been broken into on Saturday night ana
again on Wednesday night, and several
articles of silverware were stolen.
Herold said he believed the burglaries
were committed by a gang headed by
Thomas Reynolds, a young man who had
been workiug for him, but who had been :
discharged.
Reynolds was arrested on Monday by '
Policemen Buckley and O'Connetl in j
South San Francisco for petty larceny, but i
he was released on his own recognizance
by Judge Joachirnsen. His case comes up
in the Judge's court to-day.
Herold was advised to be on hand this I
morning and swear out a warrant for j
Reynolds' arrest on the charge of burglary, j
He said that, several houses in his neigh- I
borhood had recently been entered by I
burglars, but no arrests had been made. j
ALAMEDA'S MILK SUPPLY
The Monthly Bulletin Issued
Yesterday by the Board
of Health.
RESULT OF THE NEW SYSTEM.
Dairymen Have Taken Care to Make
a Good Showing in the
Reports.
The second monthly bulletin of the con
ditions of the Alameda milk supply was
issued yesterday, in accordance with the
pJans recently adopted by the Board of
Health in the Encinal city. A direct
practical benefit of the system is indicated
by the fact that four of the dairies are re
ported to ba in "good" sanitary condition,
while only two were so reported a month
ago.
The use of the word "good" is used by
the inspectors as meaning practically per
fect, or as good as could be desired, and
there is no actual criticism of those de
clared to be in fair condition. Two dairies
were reported to be in poor sanitary con
dition, but the existing troubles at these
are said to be of only a temporary nature,
and the proprietors are making the sug
gested improvements.
The bulletin of the dairies in fair or
good sanitary condition is as follows:

There are several dairies that were not
represented in the tests made.
Hay, bran, middlings and grass are the
chief foods used in all the dairies. More
grass was obtainable in March than in
February, and as a consequence the later
report shows high percentages in cream
and corresponding reductions in the per
centages of the butter fats.
The milk standard adopted by the Ala
meaa Board of Health requires 6.8 per cent
of cream and 9.6 per cent of butter fats,
and as may be seen in the monthly report
the Alaraeda supply goes far above the
standard.
Dr. Toia Carpenter, the Veterinary In
spector in the Aiameda Health Office, de
clared that the city's milK supply is un
questionably the best and purest on earth,
and that Aiameda is the only city which
lias everything relating to the supply
under satisfactory control.
One advantage in the field which Dr.
Carpenter covers is that the milk wagons
can come into the City only over two or
three roads, and consequently there is
good opportunity for mating inspections.
It has been stated that certain milkmen
proposed to sue the Board of Health for
damages on account of the publication of
j the first bulletin, but no steps in that di
j"fection have yet been taken. Certain
; dealers, however, question the right of the
board to issue the bulletins, but they do
not want to be placed in tne unfavorable
position that would result from a test case.

is for damages for being ejected from a
train at Towles station, above Sacra

Martin is a fruitdealer in Sioux City.
On July 15, 1895, he purchased a ticket,

look for the Ohio crop, and on this unofficial in
formation wheat was strong on the curb yester
day afternoon and on the \ regular market to-day.
The Ohio State report will be issued in a few days,
and it is expected to show a very low average on
the condition.' The Kansas State report Is due
about the same time, and the effect of one, It is
thought, will offset that of the other. St. Louis
was a very good buyer early to-day, the purchas
ers lor that account affording considerable
strength and support to the market, but on tne
brenk which occurred later the selling orders came j
from the same direction. The cold weather pre
vailing this morning, light Northwestern receipts.
16 cars, ami the bullish tone of the Cincinnati
Price Current' were all helps to strength. The
very small arrivals in the Northwest weredueto
the recent storms.
Liverpool cables were quiet. Chicago received 7
cars and inspected out R5.952 bushels. After noon
the sentiment changed and prices declined, the
predictions of fine weather causing discourage
ment to buyers. Closing Continental cables were
higher. Export clearances were moderate at 2H5,
--830 bushels. Slav wheat opened from 8 (a.64V4C,
declined to 63y a c. closing at 6Sy 2 (563%c asked,'
14c under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 10 cars. -
- CORNâ Did not move of Its own volition, but re
ceived its impulse from wheat, business was at
low-water mark, the liEht trading being entirely
for local account. Liverpool cables were quiet and
unchanged. Receipts were lS?b cars. There were
no withdrawals from store. Export clearances
amounted to 227.762 bushels. May corn opened
at 29*4 c, sold between â¢293,i@29%c and 'J9Va(S>
29&' s c. closing at 29Vfe@29itac, y 8 c under yester
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 190 cars.
OATS â Did not draw any attention, the market
being in a dormant state throughout the session
with price changes prompted by the variations in
the tone of wheat. Receip.s were 114 cars. There i
were no withdrawals from store. May oats closed j
V' 8 c under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 120 cars.

PROVISIONSâ Opened at a moderate improve
ment over yesterday. The rise in the live hog
market Impelled product to advance. Very
shortly after the opening prices were back to about
yesterday's closing position, the offerings : proving
too weighty for the demand. . Later the feeling be
came weak and everything declined. May pork
closed ir>(a l7 1 2 1 ' lower, May lard "i-jc lower, and

IN TON YARDS. 111.. April 2.â The sup
ply of cattle to-day was light. The demand showed
no particular improvement, but the meager supply
imparted strength to the market. An advance of
10c was noted. The run of .hogs, was light and
buyers were, obliged to purchase at s(dloc ad
vance. The demand was good. Offerings of sheep
were light and the market, owing to that fact, was
10c higher. *Â» â  -.-â â .â '

THE COAL TRADE.
The private circular of 1. Steuart gives the re
ceipts at this port thus far this year at 342,800
tons, against 360,800 tons during the same time in
1896, and says: "There is little change to note in
the local Coal -market during the month. The
various sources of supply have contributed about
their average quantity. Prices continue to rule
low and decideoly in favor of consumers. A re
port is in circulation relative to a strike in the Aus
tralian Coal mines which, It is expected, will be
put in force on the 20th inst. Should the strike be
protracted it must of course materially affect this
market."

ing forward slowly from southern points. There is
no demand for shipping as yet, except for sam Die
orders. One of the principal â  scourers is taking a
few lots of year's Wool to make up a sample ship
ment of this kind of scoured stock. Receipts nre
for Â»he season; Wool sellers are rather indif
ferent as to pressing business, while we can safely
say the demand is very light, with a tame state of

Good Looks Averted Further War.
Ex-Governor W. D. Hoard of "Wisconsin
told stories last ni^ht at the session of the
National Dairy Union at the Sherman
House. This is one of them :
"I like a joke on myself as well as three
quarters of tne folks alive. One summer I
met an ex-rebel down East, one of those
lean, lanky Southerners, with a face so
Jong that he could eat oats out of a churn.
He looked me over, up and down, two or
three times each way, and then he said:
" "S that the Gov'nor of Wisconsin?'
" 'Yes.'
" 'Fit in th' war, eh ?'
" 'Yea.'
" 'We- el, 'f all th 1 Yanks had been ez
homely ez he is, we'd be a-fightin' 'em
yit!'" â Chicago Record.
How Islandii Grow.
Fifty-two new islands have appeared (by
aid of volcanic action) during the present
century and nineteen have disappeared â
have been submerged. This makes a net
pain to the earth of thirty-three isJands. â

A Romance Started the
Trouble at the Y. W.
C. Home.
LOSS OF A DIAMOND.
The Spiritualist Told the Girls
the Matron Could
Find It.
CHARGES WERE PREFERRED.
Although the Lady Directors Sat Till
Early Morn No Proof Was
Produced.
Oakland Office Pan Fraxcipco Call,)
90S Broadway, April Â± f
The secret of the trouble at the
Young Women's Christian Association
Home is out. The facts â¢which caused
the eruption that followed the directors'
investigation have been kept pro foundly
secret by those who knew, but the story
transpired to-day.
No one will be more surprised to learn
the cause of the recent troubles than the
directors who sat from 2p. m. until 2 a. m.
recently to investigat* a long set of charges
made by the young lady boarders, but
which they had no testimony to support.
Every effort made to secure from the
young ladies interested any statement re
garding their reason for alleging certain
facts failed, but now the entire matter is
explained.
Two months ago one ; the boarders lost
a valuable diamond ring in a most myste
rious manner. It was taken from her
room during the evening when all the
large family of boarders were in thehouse.
A party of the most intimate friends of the
loser were informed of the loss and a coun
cil of war held. It was decided that the
missing article must be in the hands of
some one in the house and must be
secured.
The girls interested were in the habit of
using any article of dress of the others
they chose and returning it, but each
vowed that she had not had the ring the
night it was missed. The matter ran a
day or two, and as it was seen the ring
would not return it was decided that some
decisive steps must be taken to recover it.
One of the girl* in a playful way sug
gei-ted that a medium should be consulted
and no publicity would result. The idea
was hailed as a capital one and it was
unanimously decided to carry it out.
Fonie time was spent in locating a suitable
person and securing a date when the
whole party could attend, but finally the
details were all settled and the sitting
held.
To 1 ? medium told the young ladies that
an espionage was kept over them by the
matron, and ihat sbe not only could tell
where the ring wis but that she knew the
contents of their letters and what took
place in their rooms when they had any
company. In fact she made it out that
the matron spied on their every move
ment and was responsible for all their
woes.
The party returned to the home convinced
that they had received their moneys worth.
Long ana formal allegations were
made out and presented to the directors.
That body at once called a meeting and
asked the interested ones to present testi
mony in support of their charges. The
young ladies were caught napping. They
had never counted ob having to give their
authority and the source of their informa
tion.
The girls saw their mistake, but refused
to divulpe where they secured their infor
mation. The lady directors coaxed, begged,
pleaded, threatened, cross-questioned the
girls together and separately, but they re
fused to give in. Matters were patched up
for the time, but the directors dismissed
three girls who had talked too strongly
before the hearing. The others felt they
were equally as guilty and must leave also,
which they did, and now peace reigns su
preme in the hpme again.
It is not at all likely that any of the
girls will again go to a medium with
family affairs for advice.
FIGHTING FOR PRIMARIES
Ward Clubs Are Not Disposed
to Submit to the "Corn-
mittee of Six."
Interest Over a Federal Appointment
at Berkeleyâ Populists Are
Active.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 2. f
If the committee of conference, consist
ing of three members from each of the
ward clubs, s:iall decree that primaries
are advisable they will be held notwith
standing the action of toe "committee of
six," who nave already decided in favor of
appointing delegates to the Sacramento
convention. If primaries are attempted the
movement will be due to the ward clubs
in Oakland and Alameda which have ap
pointed members to the conference com
mittee. In this movement the new club
in the Fifth Ward and the First Ward
Club, of which Dr. B. A. Rabe is presi
dent, have led the way. The Second Ward
Club under t. M. Fisher't presidency has
co definitely declared its preference for
primaries that it is regarded as certain
they will sustain the action of the other
clubs.
Should arrangements be made for pri
maries it would be done by these confer
ence committees meeting together and
adopting a plan. Among members of the
J"irÂ«t Ward Club the favorite plan appears
to be to have the club conduct the pri
mary and to Hold it in the evening, so that
Tvorkingmen and business men can par
ticipate-.
A: the meeting of the First Ward Club
last night it wan decided to instruct the
conference committee to take measures to
have primaries held in Uie city of Oakland
on or before April 25.
A second First Ward Republican Club
was organized Tuesday evening by W. H.
Siedentopf, which is said to be interested,
in Supervisor Pelouze's fight to succeed
himself.
The Fiftieth Assembly District Peo
ple's Party Club will hold a meeting at
Enterprise Hall, corner of Twenty-second
and Grove streets, on Saturday night,
April 4. This will be the first meeting of
the club in its new headquarters and the
members of the party who reside in the
Fifteenth Assembly District are expected
to attend largely, as preparations will be
made for holding the precinct elections
for delegates to the coming county con
vention and other important business.
There is an interesting fight in progress
for the postnia*tership of Berkeley. Con
gressman Hilborn favors Ole Vinzent,
while ex-Congressman English favors any
one but Vinzent.
The other candidates are Charles Kearns,
T. C, Landregan and Pope. All kinds of
charges against the candidates have been
forwarded to Washington and as the pres
ent term has expired the appointment is
daily expected. The fight is really as to
whether the English or lr ish Democratic
faction? have most pull with the Cleve
land administration.
ACTION AT ALAMEDA.
The Regular Republican Club Ap
points a Conference Com
mittees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 3.â The Regu
lar Republican Club held a meeting at
G. A. R. Hall. A committee consisting of
Edward Hanston, E. A. yon Schmidt and
J. P. Clark was appointed to confer with
the clubs of Oakland with a view to secur
ing primaries for the selection of delegates
to the State Convention.
Alexander M?ckie addressed the meet
ing, his remarks being made for the pur
pose of having the club amalgamate with
the Alameda Republican Club. The
proposition was not favorably looked upon
by the regulars and nothing was done, the
two retaining the same positions as in the
past.
It was decided to send a letter to the
Alameda Republican Club proposing that
each club select a list of delegates and
then hold a joint election for delegates to
the State Convention.
A committee of three was appointed to
confer with E. K. Taylor of the State
Central Committee and make arrange
ments for the holding of primaries.
The mock election of a President resulted
in a victory for McKinley, who received 17
votes. The other candidates received votes
as follows: Allison 13, Lincoln 9, Reed 1.
WAS ALL CUT AND DRIED
The Cutting Divorce Case
Settled by the Husband
Getting a Decree.
Mrs. Cutting Is in England and the
Cause of the Separation Was
Not Made Known.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,) i
908 Broadway, April 2t f
Francis Cutting of the Cutting Packing
Company of San Francisco, who has re
sided in this city for a long time, was '
granted a divorce from his wife to-day by \
Judge Frick, on the ground of desertion.
The case was called at an eariier hour
than usual this morning. The petitioner
was represented by W. H. Chickering and j
the defendant, Mrs. Frances E. Cutting,
by W. W. Foote and T. C. Coogan. The
matter was jo arranged that the family
skeleton was not revealed.
Francis Cutting, the petitioner, was j
called to the stand. He testified that he I
had been married to his wife in Massa- j
chusetts in 1866; that he had come to this i
State soon after that, and that nis wife i
came here in 1861. In 1876 Mrs. Cutting 1
had pone East, and had rtmained there!
ever since save on the occasions of some
short trips which she had made to the
coast. The iast time the witness saw his
wife was in March, 1895. She was then in !
San Francisco. He had conversed with
her there, and had expressed to her a wish j
that she would return to him and resume j
her relations witn him as wife, but Mrs. I
Cutting declined to comply with the re
quest. She went East later, and he had
not ?een her since. During all the years
of her absence from her home, however,
the witness said he had provided for her
support.
Miss Mary K. Patterson took the stand
and testified that she was a first cousin of I
Mrs. Cutting and her confidential friend.
She knew that Mrs. Cutting would not
return to her husband, as she had often
said so.
Mrs. Cutting is now in the Isle of Wight,
and Â«he had given the witness authority
to employ counsel to protect her interests
in any proceeding that might be insti- :
i tuted. The instrument delegating this j
power to the witness was attested by Gen- j
eral Collins when that gentleman was an
American Consul to England.
Judge Frick, after hearing evidence from
Attorney Chickering, who was sworn as a !
witness, granted a decree of divorce and j
awarded all the community property to
Mr. Cutting. This plan had evidently
been settled previous to going into cour{. j

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 1896.
FIRE IN A PAINT SHOP
It Spread Till Twenty Thousand
Dollars' Worth Was
Coosumed.
EASTERN MILLINERY BURNED.
Broadway Again the Scene of a Dis
astrous Blaze â Foretold by
Eva Fay.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 2. f
Fire broke out in the Ainsworth block
on Broadway this morning and before it
was extinguished four stores were gutted
and the damage amounted to $20,000.
The fire started in the rear of G. Cash
more's paintstore, 1011 Broadway, and it
worked its way north through Kohler &
Chase's music-store, then into Briggs'
millinery-store and was finally checked at
Moran's clothing-store.
It is supposed that the fire originated by
spontaneoua combustion among the var
nish, turpentine, wall-paper and other
inflammable material that was stored in
the basement. After burning for some
time in Cashmere's store the thin par
tition between the paintshop and the
piano-store was demolished and the
flame fed on pianos for a while. Then it
burned through into the millinery estab
lishment and the â  clothing-store. The
dense, greasy smoke settled on every
thing wherever it penetrated and did as
much damace to the musical instruments
and clothing as though they had actually
been reached by the fire. The cellars
were divided by heavy brickwork, but there
was a door connection and these doors
supplied the neeaed draught for the big
blaze. The buildings are so constructed
that it was impossible to reach the cellars
until the flames above had been partially
checked.
The fire was a dangerous one for the
men to handle, owing to the frequent ex
plosions as the flames reached the various
barrels of oil and varnish.
Following are the damage and the insur
ance:
G. Cashmoreâ Stock valued at $9000,
totally destroyed. Insurance: Alliance
$1000, Caiedonia $1500, Manchester $3000;
total, $5500.
Le Roy H. Briggsâ Stock, $20,000; loss
by fire, water and smoke, $5000. Insur
ance: Etna $3000, Manchester $2000, North
American $2500; total, $7500.
Kohler & Chaseâ Loss about $10,000;
fnlly insured in various companies.
J. T. Moranâ Damage by smoke un
known ; covered by $58,000 insurance.
The Ainsworth block is insured in the
Springfield and Alliance companies for
$20,000. while the damage will probably
reach not more than $SCOO.
While superintending the firemen
! Chief Fair found his predecessor, ex-Chief
Lawton, in Moran's store, and at once or
dered him out. There was a passage of
words between the two men and the Chief
threatened arrest, but there was no more
trouble.
During the Eva Fay entertainment at
the Macdonough last night Chief Fair
asked her how soon there would be an
other big fire, and Miss Fay said, "Within
twenty-four hours, and it will be a big
one." It came within six hours, the alarm
being turned in at 4:30 this morning.
A Dwelling Bnrned.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 2.â A dwelling
house was burned to-night about two
blocks off Park avenue in Fruitvale. A
hay barn attached to the premises took
fire and made a big blaze, which caused
some unauthorized person to turn in a
general alarm. The whole department
turned out, but long before it could reach
the fire the flames were put out by the
local company. The damage will not
amount to $500.
MAY BE IN DARKNESS
Lights Must Be Shut Off
in the University
Library.
Modest Co-Eds Decline the Student
Demonstrationâ A New Boat
Crew.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 2.â Tbere is a
strong probability of the lights in the
library at the university being shut off
within a few days, because of the lack of
fuel to suppiy the turnacea. All the coal,
with the exception of about a ton, has
been used, and there is no wood. No
raon y is available in the lighting fund
for the purchase of any more fuel. "The
consequence will be that the lights will
have to be turned off," said Professor
Cory to-day, "as soon as the small
amount of coal runs out, unless we get in
a new supply. The lighting of the
library is done through a private
fund. We cannot draw on the
university treasury for help. The wiring
of the building and the necessary equip
ment were put up by private donations,
and the means to keep the dynamos poing
were also donated. Since the money in
that fund has all been used we can do
nothing but to stop the lights when the
fuel runs out.'/
To-day some of the students turned
their hands to cutting a few cypress and
eucalyptus logs for the furnace so as to
keep up the lights which would enable
them to study at nieht in the library. As
the examinations for the year will soon
begin the library will be in great demand
from now until the end of the term
especially at night, and the students are"
expressing hope that enough money can
be raised to pay the expense of running
the dynamos, which is about $7 a night.
Boat Hares.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 2.â The four
classes of the State University have each
of them organized a boating crew to com
pete in the" interclass regatta on Sessions
Basin, Oakland, on Saturday afternoon.
The "M crew consists of "Peck, Wilson,
Allen and Wittehmeyer. English, Mc-
Donald, Cole and Dean or Breckenburg
will row for ' 97. The sophomore oarsmen
will be Trew. Hopper, Grimwood and
Prendergast. The ireshmen who are to
uphold their class honor in the regatta are
Gibbon*, Castlehun, Jackson and Fryer.
In addition to the interclass races there
will be single-scull races, for which four
teen men have entered, as follows: Hop
per, Hammer, McWa<ie, McDonald, Mor
row, Smith, Easton, English, Peck, Trew,
Pudau, Kennedy, Blake and Cole.
The Modest Co-Eds.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 2.â Students
of the State University to-day inaugurated
a movement to give the basket-ball co-eds
a rousing reception, such as is given to
football teams, on the last night before
they meet Stanford, but the co-eds who
are practicing basket-ball objected. It is
possible, however, that students will in
sist upon a farewell demonstration, in
spite of the fact that ihe basket-bailers
may retire to the privacy of secret practice
in a locked gymnasium and refuse to
recognize the rally.
Mrs. Aghworth'a Benefits.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 2. â Mrs.
Joseph Ashwonh, the widow of tbe sui
cide. Joseph Ashworth, has received from
the Butchers' Union $500 benefits, due her
by reason of her late husband's member
ship in the union. The books of the meat
market in which Ashworth was employed
show that his defalcations amount to
11400.
' Played Hookey.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 2.â Tom Wil
liams and a companion named Donnelly,
pupils of the Lorin school, have run away
and are reported to be at Port Costa. The
two boys were taken to school on Monday
by Truant Officer Esmond and on Wednes
day night they left their homes and went
to^est Berkeley. Their parents are en
deavoring to authenticate the report that
the boys are at Port Costa.
Death at Lorin.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 2.â John Ma
gin Seaquist, a nephew of Dr. Oberg of
Lorin, died early this morning from hem
orrhage of the lungs. He was a nat've of
Sweden, aged 24, and had resided in Lorin
about one year.
ANXIOUS FOR THE ROAD
The Contra Costa Project Taken
Up by the Lafayette
Farmers.
It Will Soon Be Impossible to Procure
Rights of Way Except by
Condemnation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broad way, April 2. 5
The farmers of Alarneda and Contra Costa
counties are aniious for some relief from
tbe present difficulties of communication
between the two counties, owing to the ab
sence of a wagon road across the Berkeley
hills.
Twenty years ago the road could have
been built for a quarter of what it will
cost now, and twenty years hence it will
be almost impossible vo obtain the neces
sary right of way. At an enthusiastic
meeting, held at Lafayette, the matter of
the load was taken up and the movement
was started afresh. The demand for the
road and the necessity for its being built
as soon as possible are clearly set forth in
a statement just compiled by a landowner
across the border.
"Five or six years ago," he says, "there
were but a few farmhouses and dairies in
Hayes Valley. Now the hillsides as well
as the valleys are bedecked with beautiful
homes and miniature parks. Land within
three-quarters of a mile from the Contra
Costa line in the valley is worth $800 to
$1000 per acre; that adjoining the county
line from $100 to $200 per acre, while oh
our side it is valued at from $20 to $30 per
acre. Therefore a standard road should be
built within lour or five years tap
ping this county centrally^ as this
sunny belt on the Akimeda side,
from the State University extending
west along the foothills to Frultvale, tea
or twelve years hence will be one of the
richest residence sections in the State ;
consequently the urgency to build the road
immediately becomes apparent, for in the
future to procure the right of way on the
Alameda side will require time, money,
and, worst of all. litigation, that would
mean half a century, perhaps never, and
this section the sufferer. Another seem
ing absurdity with the majority of land
owners is their objections to an additional
tax.
"Let us make a comparison of figures,
for the sake of argument. To build a
standard road and macadamize it six
inches deep with rock will require about
$10,000, draining one of the most fertile
sections in the State, and within three
hours' drive of the richest market on the
Pacific Coast, embracing an area of
about 64,000 acres, with a valuation say
of $3,000,000, by levying a half per
cent tax would raise more than the
necessary amount to build this road. If
this is too much to do at one time, it
could be done by bonds. Now the ob
jection of the average farmer is the enor
mous portion he would have to pay at
once. Take the farmer with a 100-acre
farm, valued at say $6000, one-half percent
equals $30, the enormous sum toward the
building of a substantial road ! Now what
does it cost him annually to market hia
produce with the present roads. If lie
does not he is compelled to patronize the
railroad or the commission shark."
As an example of the possible increase
of values in foothill property, it is re- I
marked that seventeen years ago a piece j
of property at the junction of Fifteenth
street and Telegraph avenue was offered j
for $1400. Four years ago it was sold to the I
promoters of the Central Bank (two-thirds
of it) for $140,000. The remaining third
Bold for $71,000. Land has wonderfully in

â¢â¢BIG-FOOT DAVE."
The Nooie Tightens Around the Gold-
Brick Man.
The gold-brick swindlers are the draw
ing card at the Police Court this week.
AsMstant District Attorney L. S. Church
and Prosecuting Attorney H. A. Melvin are
doing their best to bring out the necessary
evidence to show the conspiracy between
"Big-foot Dave" Gordan and Root in the
swindle, but Attorney Emil Nusbaumer
is hphting for every inch of ground, caus
ing much delay.
J. A. Leonard, clerk of the Metropole,
identified Root, alias Raymond, alias etc.,
aa E. D. Nesbit, who registered at the
hotel in January ; also testified that Farmer
Hofstra was there off and on during Nesbit's
stay. Hamilton Coleman, manager for
Max Marcus, testified to his dealings with
Root under tbe name of Miller regarding
storage of trunks, which he was told con
tained har/lware.
Nusbaumer tried hard to have the testi
mony ruled out, as it had not been shown
thatthe contents of the trunk were for any
illegal purpose, but failed.
Richard Briare, proprietor, and Samuel
Frazier, porter, of the Metropole, testified
to Root being at the hotel under the name
of Root; of "Big-foot Dave" Gordan's vis
its, as well as Hofstra's, and the hand
lings of the heavy trunks.
A. Gates, the liveryman, testified to
Root and GorUnn being at his stable to
gether on several occasions.
Detective Graham of San Francisco tes
tified that he knew Root as Billy Ray
mond and "Bi^-foot Dave" as Charley
Gordan; had seen them together in San
Francisco saloons on several occasions.
Nusbaumer tried to have this ruled out, as
it was after the alleged swindle; but the
court ruled against him.
After tome further testimony the case
was continued until morning.

LIKE HORAIIUS OF OLD
Webster-Street Property Owners
to Fight for Their Ala
meda Bridge.
INTERESTS THAT CONFLICT.
Rivalry in Regard to the Route Over
the Estuaryâ Litigation Is
Threatened.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 2.â Strong op
position to the abandonment of the Web
ster-street drawbridge has developed
among the property-owners at the West
End, and it is not probable that any
change will be made without a fight in the
courts.
Webster street in Alameda has become
something of a business center for the
West End. There are many stores there,
and that part of the city has in a measure
settled itself about the business street.
The project of abandoning Webster street
as the highway between Alameda and
Oakland is therefore opposed by some of
the merchants and interested property
owners.
If the change were made the Oakland
and Alameda traffic would be diverted
from Webster street, aud a new route
for it would be established two or three
blocks to the eastward, McPherson street
being suggested.
The property-owners in the neighbor
hood of the .latter street are not opposed
to the projected change, and it is expected
that they will advocate the single bridge
measure as likely to increase the value of
their lands. That will make two conriict
| ing property interests at the West End,
| and these interests are certain to wake
themselves felt in the settlement of the
bridge question.
The Alice-street route is favored by busi
ness men in the eastern portion of the
city as giving a better ana more direct
j route to and from Oakland. Tne Webster
street roadway has long been in a very un
i satisfactory condition, deep mud there be
j ing the terror of wagon-travelers in the
; rainy seasons, and unless the West End
â  people can bring about an improvement
I of the condition the muddy roadbed will be
! used as a subject of argument in favor of
the McPherson and Alice-street route.
It is agreed by all that a new bridge
â  must be built, but the Webster-street peo
ple contend that with the proposed bridge
at Alice street there would be no need of
demolishing the present t-tructure at Web
ster street. Against this assertion is the
demand of the shipping that there be
only one drawbridge in that vicinity.
Preparations for a meeting of the Web
ster-street property-owners are under way.

HE WAS A SWINDLER.
A Colored Man With a Bogus Letter
From Rev. Mr. Duncan.
ALAMEDA. Cal., April 2.â Constable
yon Kapff arrested a negro on Park street
yesterday for vagrancy who proved to be a
i swindler. The negro's name was James
| Walker. When caught he was collecting
i subscriptions for colored people, and in a
i tin box that he carried was found the sum
j of $2 30, a result of his industrious begging.
I A bottle of whisky was found in one of the
pockets of the man's trousers. The scheme
| for collecting money was an ingenious one.
i The beggar had several circulars, which
read:
San Francisco, 3-31-96.
We, the colored people of this City, make an
I appeal to all white citizens for contributions
i for four families of colored people that wÂ«re
| sent upon us from Oregon. They were taken
from the South to work in the mines; the
I white miners would not work with them be
i cause they were negroes. They are here and
! cannot obtain work, and are in great distress ;
i they have not home or bedding. We hope you
I will drop something in this box for them, if
only 5, 10, 25 or 50 cents. Yours most re
! spectfully, Rev. George Do-can, Colored.
After Walker had been searched and
placed in a cell in the City Prison he was
i observed by Otticer Carroll to put his hand
j to his mouth and begin to chew. He was
j tearing up the circulars and trying to eat
them, but he did not get them all out of
sight. One was taken from him and, after
having been pasted to another piece of
paper, was made out to read as above.
Justice of the Peace Morris sent the vag
rant to the County Jail for six months
upon his plea of guilty to the charge
against him.
Rev. Mr. Duncan is a well-known colored
clergyman in San Francisco. His name
on the circulars had been forged.
SHOT A HOT.
Lads Were Quarreling and One of Them
Drew a Revolver.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 2.â Charles
Lambert, the 13-year-old son of C. H.
Lambert of 561 Thirty-eighth street, a
conductor on the Telegraph-avenue elec
tric line, was shot in the arm by an un
known boy yesterday near his home. The
boy had some trouble Monday with Walter
Rogers, George Palmer, Harold Hyde and
Charlea Lloyd, all under 18, when one
drew a revolver and threatened Lambert.
While crossing a vacant lot yesterday
morning, Lambert heard some one say :
"There is the fellow I want," and a mo
ment later he was shot. He fails to iden
tify either of the above as one of his as
sailants. Mrs. Lambert has sworn to war
rants charging all the boys with disturb
ing her peace, and they will be arrested in
the morning, and if it can be found which
had the revolver a more serious charee
will be put against him.
License Men Disagree.
OAKLAND, Cal., Adi-U 2.â Ah Lee, a
Chinese vegetable peddler, applied to Dep
uty Tax Collector Cole for a license to-day.
He presented the following note, which
may cause License Inspector Mitchell
some trouble. The note reads:
Oakland City Hall, March 26, 1896.
The bearer, Ah Lee, having ball deposited
â with the Police Clerk is entitled to peddle
with this permit untii April 2. 1896.
L. A. Mitchell, License Inspector.
The Chinaman was arrested two weeks
ago for peddling without a license and his
case was continued un'il to-day so he
would not be compelled to pay a |15 li
cense for the few days of last quarter. Mr.
Mitchell gave him the note, tie says, after
consultation with Judge \Vood and Chief
Lloyd in order to save the Chinaman
from further interference by the police.
Mr. Cole claims that the License Inspector
exceeded his authority and is keeping the
note for further use.

"Want* a New Trial.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 2.â W. A. Dun
combe has tiled an affidavit for a new
trial in the case of Andrew Wettstein vs.
the Southern Pacific Railway Company in
which the plaintiff was awarded $6090
damages. He alleges that "after the jury |
had been charged and had retired they j
came into the court without having re- j
turned a veriict, and by their foreman )
stated to the court that the jury wanted j
to know something in regard to costs â !
about the costs of the doctors."
The statement for a new trial covers â 
about 100 folios, and alleges 125 errors in i
the rulings of the court. One allegation
is that the verdict was excessive and was I
rendered through passion and prejudice,
and that the accident to Wettstein was
due to negligence of plaintiff.
Cycle Show.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 2.â The Yonne
Men's Christian Association cycle show
opens to-day in their building at Twelfth
and Clay streets. Some thirty firms deal
ing in wheels are making handsome ex
hibits, and the show will be a tine one in
that respect. An orchestral concert will
be given both afternoons and evenings,
to-day and to-morrow at 2 p. m., and again
at 7:30 o'clock. Admission is to be free
to men and women, no children admitted
unless accompanied by parents. The ob
ject is to increase^the interest of the mem
bers in wheeling and to bring a larger
number of people into contact with the
association and its privileges.
Damage Case Postponed.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 3.â The case of
C. J. Norman against the Alameda and
Oakland Electric Railway Company was
to have been commenced this mornins be
fore Judge Ellsworth. A continuance was
granted by Judge Frick, which was satis
factory to all concerned. Judge Ellsworth
. is ill with a broken arm, the result of a bug
gy accident, and Messrs. D^lraas <fe Short
ridge, who appear for plaintiff, were un
willing to enter upon the trial, as they
must be present at the Fair will case to
morrow in San Francisco. The railroad
company was also agreeable.
Success of K vu Fay.
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 2.â Eva Anna
Fay, the mental telegraphist has been so
cordially received in this city at the Mac
donough that she has decided to continue
over Sunday night. Her mind-reading is
the one topic of conversation in the city.
CHARGED WITH CONTEMPT
Alameda City Trustees Ordered i
Into Court by Judge
Frick.
Elwood Bmner's Latest Move in the
Electric Light Works
Dispute.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 2.â The mem
bers of the Board of Trustees have been
ordered to show cause to-morrow before
Judge Frick why they should not be j
punished for contempt of court in dis
obeying the temporary injunction issued
restraining further work by them upon the
electric light building improvements. '
Attorney Bruner, as attorney for J. T. I
Fleming, the plaintiff in the litigation, I
made this move after having paid a visit I
to the electric light premises this morning j
and noting what work was in progress and !
what had been done since the issuance of
the order from the court.
He went to Oakland ami asked for an !
order of citation and it was granted. The!
order, which was served on each of the five j
I Trustees, reads as follows:
You are hereby cited to appear before the
; Judge of this court, at the Courthouse, in the
city of Oakland, on Friday, the 34 day of April,
1896, at 9 :3O o'clock in the forenoon of that
day, then and there to show cause, if any you
can, why you and each of you should not be
punished lor contempt for the willful violation
of the temporary restraining order heretofore
issued * * * requiring you not to permit
the completion of the addition to the building
occupied by the electric-light plant in the city
of Alameda, in said State, until the further or
der of this court.
City Attorney Taylor became cognizant
of the issuance of the order while in Oak
land this mornine, but did nothing. He
: has a case set for trial in the Justices'
| Court to-morrow, and will probably ask
for a continuance of the hearing of the
contempt proceedings until at a later date.
Peculiar interest attaches itself to this
case, as it is said to be the rirst in Cali
fornia in which a municipal governing
power has been cited to appear for con
tempt.
This is the latest move of Elwood
Bruner, attorney for J. T. Flemng, in the
attempt to prevent the Trustees from en
larging the electric-light plant so as to be
able to sell light to private parties. Flem
ing says he is only a nominal plaintiff,
having allowed them to use his name, al
though he has no objection to the city
selling light.
Tbe Trustees cited for contempt are: T.
W. Lydecker, William Hammond, A. V.
Clark, F. J. Fletter and J. F. Forderer.

MAY RE-ENTER POLITICS
Return of William H. Chamber*
lain, Once a Shining
Light
HE HELD MANY GOOD OFFICES.
Liberality and a Propensity for Bor
rowing Got Him Into Diffi
culties.
William H. Chamberlain, ex-National
Bank Examiner, ex-president of the Dirigo
Club, ex-president of the Union League
Club, ex-freight auditor of the Southern
Pacific Company and ex-assistant secre
tary of the Pacific Union Club, dropped
into town the other day as suddenly and
quietly as he dropped out three years ago.
Chamberlain was a shining light among
those who were in the political swim in
1892 and 1893 and almost everything he
asked in the way of political honors jvas
given him.
He aided materially in the organization
of the Dirigo Club, that was afterward
merged into the Union League, and was
made its president. Later he was given
every honor that the big Republican club
could confer, and when President Harri
son's turn for naming a postmaster for
San Francisco came around Chamberlain
j was pushed forward for the office.
It seemed almost within his grasp, when
| Samuel W. Backus made a bid for the
place, and his influence being stronger
I than that of Chamberlain the latter was
1 shelved temporarily. Later it was found
I that a position as "National Bank Exami-
I ncr was open ana he received the appoint
ment.
In order to accept this lucrative position
he had to resign his position with the
Southern Pacific Company that he had
held for several years. While he was in
the zenith of his prosperity and was looked
upon as a coming leader in Republican
! politics rumors began to spread that all
i was not well with the funds of the Union
! League Club. Chamberlain was not ac
j cused of making away with them except
I by his enemies, but an employe was found
! to be short, and he was held lobe responsi
ble for the deficit. The matter was quietly
; settled up and nothing more thought of it
; until Chamberlain was" suddenly relieved
: from his position of Bank Examiner.
It was given out that it had been dis
; covered he had borrowed money from a
number of banking institutions, which it
was his duty to investigate, and that the
accounts of a number of banks had not
been as closely scrutinized as they should
have been.
From that time his prestige waned and
he suddenly left the City and was known
j to his oid haunts no more. Sone of his
i old friends gave out that the constant
worry of politics had undermined his brain
and that he had gone to a private institu
tion, where be could be taken care of.
! This was defied by his relatives, however,
! and his name became but a memory
i among his former associates.
Within the past year he has made him
self somewhat prominent in Los Angeies
as a political organizer and was supposed
to be on the road to prosperity again, so
that his sudden advent here is puzzling
his acquaintances. It is believed, how
ever, that he is looking the field over with
a view to re-entering local politics in case
a favorable opportunity appears.
At present be is sojonrnine in Oakland
and seldom appears on this side of the
bay. __^_________
The Ruling Spirit Strong.
The prosecuting attorney of a North
Missouri county and a young attorney
noted for his persistence were recently try
ing the preliminary hearing of a criminal
case before a justice of the peace. The
young attorney asked many irrevalentand
incompetent questions, and when the
prosecuting attorney would object would
always say :
'â¢Your Honor, before you pass on that
objection I want to argue it."
Finally the young man asked the snme
question the seventh time, against the
Prosecuting Attorney's objection, when
tne prosecutor, losing his patience, said
in a loud aside :
â¢' , are never going to get over being
a confounded fool?"
Whereupon the young fellow jumped up
with his usual remark :
"Your Honor, before you pass on that I
want to argue it."
Women were for certain offenses publicly
burned to death in England by a law which
was not abolished till 1790. Pressing to

Reception.
The morning as well as the afternoon
meeting was crowded, mostly with
ladies, and the programme was well ren
dered. The afternoon meeting, however,
was the feature of the day.
The parts of the programme received
witb the best evidences of appreciation
were the reports by Miss Cuibertson and
Miss Cameron and* Mrs. O. N. Ramsey's
"A Sketch From History."
In comparing the past year with those
preceding, Miss Cuibertson said that not
bo much actual remains of Chinese women
and girls had been done as formerly, for
the reason that they had been Kept behind
heavily barred doors such as would require
the force of an ancient Jewish batttring
ram to demolish.
Miss Cameron introduced her essay by
saying, "It has been said that no city in
the world so much resembles tlie Jerusalem
of long ago as the San Francisco of to-day.
Certainly, no one who spends a day in our
Mission H^rve can doubt the trutti of this
statement. Then followed an account of
the weddings that had taken place at the
home during the year previous, and a
description of how many of the women
had come back to spend a night or two
and leave small sums of money for carry
ing on the work.
Mrs. Ramsey spoke extemporaneously,
explaining and illustrating a part of her
statements by an ingenious combination
of gilded sticks and colored ribbons. The
ribbons represented respectively the mem
bers of the Jewish, the Greek Catholic, the
Protestant, the Moslem and the Roman
Catholic churches, rei>re?enting 435,000,000
persons in the world. At the last was a long
black ribbon which represt-nted those out
side the fold of the Good Shepherd. T eir
number was estimated at 1,05.i,000,000.
Pinned to this ribbon was a tiny blue riD
bon, two-fifths of an inch in length. Said
the lady: '"This represents the 2,000,000
converted souls. Behold the work yet
to do!''
The general superintendence of affairs
wa< under the management of Mrs. P. R.
Faitand, wife of the pa<tor of the How
arn-^treet Presbyterian Church.
The president. Mrs. Browne, called upon
Mrs. Conn of LO3 Gatos for the closing
prayer, after which the meeting adjourned
until to-day.
BOUGHT MEDILL'S PLACE
President Cameron of the Chicago Edu
cational Board on the Schools
Here and in Mexico.
D. R. Comeron, president of the Board

terday, and is at the Palace. He has been
for aonu* weeks traveling in Mexico and
Southern California.
While in the southern part of this State
last week he purchased the residence of

will hereafter spend a part of each year in
his California home. President Cameron
was here last in 1880, and says he 9ee3 a
wonderful improvement in this City and
Statoaioce then. He^avsheis perfectly
charmed with California, and says he
hopes, since he now has a home here, to
be hero a threat deal hereafter.
President Cameron, bein^ at the head
of educational matters in Chicago, has an
enormous responsibility on his h:inds.
"We expend as much for the public
schools there as is done in any other city
of the world," he said. ".in<l that means
from $8,000,000 to $10,000,000 every year.
We have 4500 leacherv, and 180,000 pupils.
The schools* run for ten month- in the year.
"Yes, if I can get time I shall try and
examine a Jittle into the schools of San
Francisco. One thine has impressed me
in the State, and that is that the schools
are very good. There is a very high
standard here.
"I want to say, too, that I found (he
schools lo Mexico vastly better than 1 ex
pected. The reason? are largely ijecause
they have adopted our system, and because
they are teaching English as much as pos-
Mble. 1 found out, too, that we were mak
ing a mistake in our schools in not teach
ing Spanish, in place of German and other
languages.. I found that the business men
of Mexico would be only too glad to en
gage our young men if they only under
stood Spanish. There is afield therefor
us for friendly relations and for business."
President Cameron will bo here till the
flower bhow opens at Santa Barbara. Then
he wiii go there, and a little later to Chi
cago
Keverence for the Bible.
There is a pin prevalent in our house
holds of which we take little note, which,
in fact, we encourage either, by an indif
ference to it, or ty an active i anticipation
in its folly and wickedness: the use of the
Word of God for the purpose of making
riddles, conundrums, pnzjpinjj questiinp,
anagrams, etc., etc.*? out of it.'^vlf,- we
really believe ; in : the divine origin of the
Bible can it be ri^iu to give it to children
that â  they ; may \ construe its words into
odd connections, â¢' and ~'Â± make : sport and
laughter and mental legerdemain from its
paces'/ Isitlik'iy that ; they will rever
ence on other occasione what has pre-.
viously been food for their amusement?
It i 9 not, and we need not be astonished if
the boys and girls who have been permit
ted to turn the leaves of their Bibles for
pastime and entertainment turn them in
after years to rind pretext for their infidel
in-.âAmelia E. Barr, in April Ladies'

AT HIS EASE
One Leg Over the Arm of
a Rocker, He Talks
and Talks.
WILL NOMINATE MORTON
How a Railroad Completely
Handicaps a Man in
Politics.
WHY VANDERBILT WOH'T TALK
The Story of That Famous "Public
Be Damned" Interview With
William H.
In his room at the .Palace last evening,
his leg thrown easily over the arm of bis
rocker, Chauncey M. Depew talked and
talked in that entertaining. fashion that
has made proverbs in his name.
He talked of California and used super
latives without stint; of politics past,
present and prospective; of why he
dropped out of the Presidential race in '88;
of railroad men in politics and why they
have a right to be there; of newspaper re
porters and his experiences with them,
dropping easily from one of his Peekskill
stories to the National money question,
and always maintaining the high level of
interest to the listener.
And all this time Cornelius Vanderbiltâ
registered downstairs as plain "C. Vauder
bih" â was in another room, refusing and
refusing to talk.
One of Mr. Depew's best stories is
founded on Mr. Vanderbilt's refusals.
- The fact is Mr. Vanderbilt refuses, under
.advice of Mr. Depew, for Mr. Vanderbilt
himself gives signs of a disposition to
speak his mind. But Mr. Depew
says to him constantly when they
are together and the third man is
asking questions, 'Do not be interviewed,
Mr.. Vanderbilt," and Mr. Vanderbilt
speaks again of the beautiful weather.
Why this is so will be allowed to take its
place in the pleasant procession of Mr. De
pew's conversation, for he must first be
allowed to explain how much better he
thinks California is than all the rest of the
world, for he does think soâ he says he
does.
. This is the first visit, of the great rail
road man and politician to California, and
it may be said that the first impressions
are mutual. He looks to be all that has
been said of him and no man can remem
ber back to an ill speech concerning him.
He ij tall, straight, gray, quick of move
ment but not nervously so, wears
dark, plain clothes, a gold chain across
his vest, a boutonniere and a
wonderful pair of thick-soled shoes. The
shoes are the only things that arrest the
attention as something unexpected, for all
the rest is made familiar by the newspaper
and magazine artist.
He pronounces his name "Chancy"
rather than "Chawncey," thus further en
dearing himself to the American heart.
The party arrived last evening at 5:30,
after a day spent along the road north
from Santa Cruz. They "were conducted
by Colonel Crocker and a retinue of rail
road men, including, of course, Mr. Crane,
the local representative of the Vanderbilt
lines.
They will leave for the East on Sunday,
and the intervening time, as Mr. Depew
says, is to be heavily charged with sight
seeing and San Franciscan experience.
â  For instance last night was devoted to
Chinatown. To-day the party will take a
drive down the Napa Valley. Saturday is
down for an excursion about the bay and
a ride through Golden Gate Park to the
Cliff House, ami Saturday night the din
ner at the Union League.
â¢ There was a spreading bunch of long
stemmed roses on the center-table and a
pile of letters when Mr. Depew entered
his room last evening. One letter he sin
gled from the heap, and begged to be ex
cused until he read it. Then he threw
himself back in his chair, saying, "That is
a letter from Buster, my boy. All's well;
now go ahead."
Then he went right ahead himself. He
said he regretted very much that he could
not dine with the Bohemian Club, as he
understood it was something on the lines
of the Lotus Club of New York, of . which
the principal purpose in life was to enter
tain artists and distinguished men of let
ters. He did not know on what theory
they could entertain him as an artist ex
cept it might be a variety artist.
Mr. Depew had been quoted in an even
ing paper as saying that in all the prodi
gality of nature in California he missed
the song birds and beautiful women that
ought to be a natural complement of all
the rest. He distinctly blushed while re
pudiating this statement. As to the
birds it was ail right, but "as to the
women what I did say was this," said Mr.
Depew: "That I regretted that the speed
with which we travel took away from me
the opportunity of meeting the ladies of
California, who, when I did have that
pleasure, would no doubt be found to be
the fitting crown to all the other love
liness."
Well satisfied with this, Mr. Depew con
tinued: "We came through the Santa
Clara Valley to-day. I can say as a, â¦rav
eled man that it is the grandest valley in
the world. San Jose as the capital of that
county is a beautiful little city, with great
prospects.
â¢ "No, I have not seen the Vale of Cash
mere. I have traveled through Southern
France and all Italy. I know the famous
places of earth. There is only once
place in the world that I. have seen that
may be mentioned in the same breath with
Del Monte, and then Del Monte must be
spoken first. The other place ,is Monaco,
the great gambling headquarters ol
Europe, the little principality at ; the ; foot
of the. Pyrenees and overlooking the Mcdi-

terranean. There the drives and rich verd- j
ure and blue skies may bear comparison
with Del Monte. But it is a city, a city
of villas to be sure, but still a city. Del
Monte as a hotel is beyond compare. You
are surrounded with every luxury, ami the
wonderful beauty of Monaco, and yet
with a short walk may hide entirely from
habitations and be surrounded only by
nature, cultivated and otherwise, but al
ways in most impressive beauty.
"The thought has occurred to me that
California with protection, reciprocity and
sound money would be the greatest State
in all the world."
That brought him to the money ques
tion. "1 say protection, for I am a firm
believer in protection, but sound money is
the first thing needed to revive things.
Chauncey M. Depew, as He hat Talking Politics and Other Things in His Room at the Palace Last Evening
What I mean by sound money is [
a medium of exchange accepta- j
ble to the world with which we
do business, redeemable anywhere. I !
do not care what that is, gold, silver or pa- ;
per, or more than one, if they can be Kept j
on a parity throughout the world ; but no ;
one country can set itself up in a cur- |
rency all its own no more than an mdi- j
vidual would set up a code of laws for him
self independent of the community. The
odds are too muchâ he cannot withstand j
the pressure; and it is a most humiliating
spectacle this picture of the richest Nation i
on earth borrowing money to pay its own i
notes. A business concern found to be j

doing that wonld be considered a failure.
The remedy? Well, I would stop the
working of that endless cbain by which
the Government issues bonds to secure !
gold and pays out the gold to redeem the
bonds, and a few men in Wall j
street and Lombard street control the
financial situation ana become rich at the !
expense of the Nation. How would I stop
it? I would provide against a reissue. I
am in favor of the Carlisle plan. But that
is a long story. I have only to say that a |
sound financial policy, placing the Nation '
on a footing with the whole world, is tne :
thing necessary to bring a return of good j
times, and the cry cither of free silver or I
16 to 1 will not do it until the world is
willing."
This naturally led into National politics,
and the onset of the Presidential cam
paign. "The things that appeared clear
in April are absurd or forgotten in the
fall," he said. "I am for Morton, to be
sure. It is very likely that I shall nom
inate him at St. Louis, unless some other
son of New York shall think he can do it
better. As it stands, Republican success
is certain in November. There is the pos
sibility of Cuban and other complica
tions between now and November affecting
even that. There are only four men
whose chances at St. Louis were worth
speaking about. McKinley stands easily
in the lead, with Reed, Allison ana Mor
ton ranging in the order named. Morton
stands perhaps an even chance with Alli
son, as he starts in with seventy-t"?o of
the State delegation. We of New York,
mindful of the past, think Morton stands
a very good show. Presidents as a rule
are not made out of early favorites. These
lire all good men, and the country can be
safely trusted to any of them. McKinley
will go to the convention with a clear lead.
The only way he can be defeated is by the
held combining against him. The field
will combine and this becomes the strong
force. The question then arises as to the
name of the man upon whom it can be
brought to unite. New York is a pivotal
State. Morton has created no strong ani
mosities. For these reasons we believe he
will be considered the most available man.
No, Ido not think Harrison will figure. I
do not think he wants it. He has said so
so positively that there can be no doubt.
"No, the favorites do not win," con
tinued Mr. Depew. "Witness how often
P.laine went to the convention clearly the
National favorite, but with animosities
and favorite sons enough, too, when
united, to defeat him. I heard the famous
nominating speech of Insersoll at Cin
cinnati. Had the vote been taken im
mediately Blame would have been
chosen. Rut the insinuating toil
of the unknown individual in the
big body overcame even the effort of that
the greatest speech I ever heard for im
mediate and dramatic effect. Maine had
deticd nis enemies â came before the con
vention in that open defiance, with those
letters still fresh in the public mmd â and
it was that in Ingersoll's address that
made it notable. And out of the
rush of enthusiasm lhat it called
up and which spread over the country,
Rutherford B. Hayes, a man not before
"heard of, rose up and was made President
of the States. The opposition
found it impossible to unite on Sherman
or any other of the leaders, and after
spending the nigtit in vain efforts Hayes,
having done nothing to make enemies,
brought them together, it was the same
with Grant the last time he appeared as a
candidate and has been so in many other
cases of common note."
Mr. Depew was asked as to the story
that he is scheduled for the secretaryship
of state in the event of Mr. Morton's suc
cess.
"I have made two rules concernine the
building of bridges," he said. "One is
never to throw one across the dry bed of a
stream in the fear that I tray come to the
brink and find a flood there. The other is
never to cross a bridge until I come to it."
This led up to the railroad man in
politics.
"lt is commonly accepted that for a
man connected with a railroad politics are
impossible. I went to the convention of
1888 with ray State delegation solid for
me for the Presidential nomination. It was
the first time the delegation from New
York united for any candidate. I was to
break the spell â to deny and controvert
this story about railroad men. The rail
road men were to help me do it. They
were to remind the newspapers and peti
tioners of something which they per
sistently overlook â that there are a million
railroad men in this country. These are
intelligent and influential men in the com
munity. The station master, for instance,
of a town is usually one of the best men in
it. He knows and is in touch with every
body else in town. And yet, because he
is in the employ of the railroad, he could
not be elected poundrnaster. Well, they
feel and resent this thing.
"As I say, I was to break this SDell. I
went to the convention with the solid dele
gation,, but we had no sooner arrived on
the ground than we began to suffer from
thia general anti-railroad sentiment.
There was a careful reckoning of the vote 3
of the States necessary for success in the
genera! election. The delegates from lowa,
Nebraska and Kansas came to us and sÃid
that with a railroad man at the head of the
ticket their States would surely be lost to
the Republican party. The question re
solved itself into this: that we must bear
the onus of this loss and defeat at the
polls, if defeat followed our success in the
convention, or we must go back home
having renounced our own causeâ the
cause of railroad men.
"As showing how high the feeling ran
along these lines a little Incident that hap
pened there will illustrate. The hotel, my
headquarters, was crowded with politicians.
A prominent local railroad man came
through the hurly-burly and drew me aside
and siid, 'Chauncey, my little girl is lying
dead at my home. My wife and I were
grieving together over our great loss, when
she said to me, "George, we are in great
trouble; we feel the powep of sympathy.
Mr. Depew is down at the hotel also in
great trouble. You may do some good by
simply going down and telling him that
we think of him at this moment." '
''The man threw his arms around my
necH and kissed me and returned to his
dead."
Mr. Depew told this etory qnite simply
and with no sign in the telling of the bit
terness that the story itself might indi
cate.
Then he went on to tell something of his
experience with reporters â for it is well
known that Mr. Depew is a newspaper
man's man â said to be the most fre
quently interviewed of all men. The story
of why Cornelius Vanderbtlt refuses to be
interviewed led up to it.
"William H. Vanderbilt, father of Cor
nelius, started in as a hail-fellow-well
met among newspaper men. I encour
aged him to be so. Everywhere he went
the doors were always open to them. He
talked freely and was not afraid to express
opinions. Sometimes he was misquoted,
again misrepresented. Sometimes he
would get angry at what he
found in the papers â there was
always that prejudice against a
very rich man. lie would swear some
times that he would never see another re
porter, and that I must do the talking for
him. Still, he went on, however. One
day his car ran into Chicago. Mr. Vander
bilt happened to be feeling pretty
good, the expected reporter com
ing was invited in, a glass
of wine placed before him and
a cigar, and shortly after the reporter went
away and sent over the country that re
mark that has become a fixture in litera
tuie, a remark that Mr. Vanderbilt
did not make for two reasons â first,
because there was nothing in the
occasion to provoke it, and second,
because Mr. Vanderbilt was not a fool â
that suyine, 'the public be damned.'
"That remark was taken up as we all
know by the press the world over, and has
been harned on ever since. Mr. Vander
bilt could not get away from it. It
hounded him till his death, and still sur
vives to darken his memory. No amount
of contradiction could efface it.
"But it changed Mr. Vanderbilt's front
to the reporter. He would never see an
other, except he knew him well and he
wrote for a paper that he knew would not
'edit' the copy. That resolved itself
finally down to one reporter and two news
papers, who alone could get a word out of
him. That is why Cornelius Vanderbilt
will not talk to reporters, and why I ad
vise him not to.
"As for myself I may say I have never
been willfully misrepresented in an inter
view. But I have been made to talk like a
clown by inexperienced men who wrote
without "notes. Only a short time aeo I
was interviewed on the silver question by
a man who made no notes and who after
ward confessed that he was wholly
ignorant of the subject. When I read that
interview I asked my friends to please
have an inquiry instituted as to my
sanity."
Mr. Depew is traveling, he says, as the
guest of Mr. Vanderbilt, as are also John
Howe and George Fearing, bankers of New
York, who are of the party.
